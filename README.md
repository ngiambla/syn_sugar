# Syn Sugar #
Sweet like sugar,
   so syntatic.

   Breaking up sweet ideas since 2018.

## Background ##

Language is very interesting. By utilizing syntax, which are rules of that identify how to interpret information, we are able to communicate ideas. 
These "ideas" are represented in some fashion with a combination of symbols. By using the syntax in tandem with these symbols we can: develop complex thoughts, 
express emotions, gain access to information at an unprecented rate.  

## Installation ##

To be completed.

## Usage ##

This program should be very straight forward to use: simply place text inside the `data/` folder, and then in a terminal enter:

```bash
$ python syn_sugar.py

```
