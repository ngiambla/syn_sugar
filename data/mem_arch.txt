Abstract—Some modern high-level synthesis (HLS) tools [1]
permit the synthesis of multi-threaded software into parallel
hardware, where concurrent software threads are realized as concurrently operating hardware units. A common performance bottleneck in any parallel implementation (whether it be hardware
or software) is memory bandwidth – parallel threads demand
concurrent access to memory resulting in contention which hurts
performance. FPGAs contain an abundance of independently
accessible memories offering high internal memory bandwidth.
We describe an approach for leveraging such bandwidth in
the context of synthesizing parallel software into hardware.
Our approach applies trace-based proﬁling to determine how
a program’s arrays should be automatically partitioned into subarrays, which are then implemented in separate on-chip RAM
blocks within the target FPGA. The partitioning is accomplished
in a way that requires a single HLS execution and logic simulation for trace extraction. The end result is that each thread,
when implemented in hardware, has exclusive access to its own
memories to the extent possible, signiﬁcantly reducing contention
and arbitration and thus raising performance.
Keywords—High-Level Synthesis, memory architecture, multithreaded HLS.

I NTRODUCTION

High-level synthesis (HLS) is becoming a prevalent design
methodology for FPGAs [5], [11] with the introduction of
tools such as Vivado HLS from Xilinx [15] and Altera’s
OpenCL SDK [8]. HLS is an active area of research with
signiﬁcant effort being put towards closing the performance,
power and area gap between HLS-generated hardware and
human-expert-designed hardware. In any hardware computing
system, memory is a frequently occurring culprit for limited
performance; that is, memory bandwidth and contention for
memory among multiple accessors are common roots of limited computational throughput. Processors, and the software
programs that run on them, are typically based on the assumption of a single uniﬁed memory address space. FPGAs, on the
other hand, contain many small memories, distributed spatially,
that can each be accessed concurrently. The 3 approaches for
increasing memory bandwidth are i) memory replication, ii)
implementing multi-ported memories and iii) memory banking
through partitioning. Memory replication may incur a high
area cost and would require a synchronization mechanism
across multiple copies of the same memory unless the data is
read-only. Increasing the number of memory ports is expensive
and may not be possible on the FPGA since the block RAMs
have limited port conﬁgurations. In this article, we consider
automated generation of banked on-chip memory architectures
in the high-level synthesis of parallel software programs into

parallel FPGA hardware, with the goal of reducing memory
contention and raising bandwidth.
One of the primary aims in pursuing a hardware implementation vs. a software implementation is to exploit spatial
parallelism in the hardware. Towards this, some modern highlevel synthesis (HLS) tools, such as the LegUp HLS framework
from the University of Toronto, provide spatial exploitation
capability at the software-speciﬁcation stage by supporting
the synthesis of parallel software (threads) into parallel hardware [2]. The parallel software threads in multi-threaded C
programs written using the Pthreads or OpenMP standards,
are realized as concurrently operating units in hardware. In
this work, we are concerned with the synthesis of memory
architectures for such spatially parallel implementations, where
concurrently operating hardware units may vie for access to
the same memory ports at the same time. We seek to alleviate such contention through automated synthesis of banked
architectures such that hardware units have (partially) exclusive
access to particular ports to the extent possible.
We implement our work in the LegUp HLS framework
within its Pthreads/OpenMP parallel ﬂow. We ﬁrst augmented
LegUp with user-constraint-driven array partitioning, similar
to that available in Xilinx’s Vivado HLS tool. Based on usersupplied directives, the new functionality permits arrays to
be partitioned in a variety of different ways by the compiler,
where each partition is then implemented in separate RAMs
within the FPGA implementation. However, two issues exist
with the constraint-driven approach: 1) it can be difﬁcult to
know which style of array partitioning is best for a given array
as it depends on the memory access patterns of the parallel
program and also the architecture of the target FPGA, and
2) specifying array partitioning directives is non-standard, and
we believe it to be particularly difﬁcult for software engineers
with no knowledge of FPGA hardware.
In light of these two issues, we propose a memory-trace
proﬁling-based approach that automatically determines array
partitionings to realize banked memory architectures offering
low memory contention and high bandwidth for parallel spatial
hardware as produced by LegUp’s Pthreads/OpenMP ﬂow.
An advantage of the proposed approach is that it requires a
single HLS execution and hardware simulation of the generated
hardware to extract a memory access trace, as opposed to
more exhaustive approaches requiring many synthesis/simulation runs. Speciﬁcally, we have developed a memory-trace
simulator that permits rapid evaluation of various memory
partitioning schemes (banking architectures) using a single
execution trace of the hardware with unpartitioned arrays

through modeling contention and arbitration.

BACKGROUND

A. LegUp HLS Tool
The LegUp HLS tool is implemented within the opensource LLVM compiler [9]. Within LLVM, the program is
represented in the compiler’s intermediate representation (IR),
which resembles RISC assembly code, being composed of
simple instructions such as multiply, add, branch, jump, etc.
Prior to LegUp HLS, the program’s IR is subjected to LLVM’s
compiler optimization passes, such as dead-code elimination,
loop rotation, and common sub-expression elimination. LegUp
takes the optimized IR as input and performs the traditional
HLS stages [6] of resource allocation, scheduling, binding
and Verilog generation. In this work, array partitioning for
the purposes of banked memory architecture synthesis is
implemented as a generic LLVM optimization pass. As will
be detailed below, the original arrays in the IR are broken
into pieces and array accesses are steered to the appropriate
sub-array.
B. Synthesis of Parallel Software to Hardware
In LegUp’s Pthreads synthesis ﬂow, multi-threaded software is synthesized into parallel hardware whose behaviour
closely matches the software semantics. Each software thread
is synthesized into an instance of a hardware unit. Pthreads
library function calls in the original C program are replaced
with LegUp-speciﬁc wrapper functions that cause speciﬁc
hardware structures to be produced in the RTL generation
phase. For example, calls to pthread_create are translated into FSM functionality that invokes a hardware unit
corresponding to a software thread. Support is provided for
common thread synchronization approaches including mutexs
(for critical sections) and barriers. Ultimately, the Pthreads
ﬂow permits a wide range of spatial parallel implementations
to be realized through software changes alone. The interested
reader is referred to [2], [3] for complete details. Our work
here seeks to alleviate a speciﬁc (and common) performance
bottleneck in such parallel hardware, namely, when multiple
parallel hardware units contend for memory.
C. LegUp’s Memory Architecture
LegUp HLS implements each array structure in a separate
logical RAM. Depending on its size, the logical RAM may be

implemented in multiple physical block RAMs in the FPGA
implementation (e.g. when the array size exceeds the SRAM
block size in the FPGA fabric). For RAMs that may be accessed concurrently by parallel hardware, LegUp automatically
inserts arbitration circuitry. The arbiter permits single-cycle
access in the absence of contention. Under contention, it is
resolved in a round-robin style, in which case a hardware unit
will stall until it is granted access, degrading performance.
Such degradation is particularly common in the Pthreads
synthesis ﬂow.
Consider, for example, parallelized vector addition, Z =
A + B, where Z, A, B are n-element arrays. In a typical
multi-threaded implementation, each thread would operate on
a portion of the original arrays. With t threads implemented as
t parallel hardware units there would be signiﬁcant contention
on the ports of RAMs holding the arrays, even if the RAMs
were in dual-port mode.
LegUp uses “points-to” analysis in LLVM to designate arrays as either local, shared-local or global [3]. Local arrays are
accessed by a single function in the C code. Shared-local arrays
are accessed by a limited number of functions, as determined
statically at compile time. For arrays designated as global,
the points-to analysis was unable to statically determine the
accessors. In hardware, such arrays are implemented behind
a global memory controller that uses a unique tag for each
array to steer accesses to the correct SRAM block containing
the array [1]. For this work, we focus on shared-local arrays
since global memory requests cannot be parallelized due to the
memory controller and local memory will be scheduled such
as to avoid port contentions.

R ELATED W ORK

A number of recent works have considered memory banking in HLS. Below we highlight those we believe are most relevant to the present research. However, an important distinction
of our work is the focus on the memory architecture synthesis
in the multi-thread HLS context. Our technique speciﬁcally
targets the synthesis of banked architectures that result in
reduced contention among the hardware implementation of
parallel software. To the authors’ knowledge, no prior work
has considered this scenario.
As with the present work, a recent work by Zhou et
al. [16] applied a trace-based approach to memory banking and employed a conﬂict-graph-based approach to map
memory addresses to banks, with emphasis on multiplexer
size minimization. Formal techniques were used to verify the
mapping was indeed conﬂict free. As opposed to our approach,
which chooses an architecture from the trace, [16] requires
the number of banks as an input to the algorithm, and solely
handles the conﬂict-free cases (there is no arbitration).
Other works include [4] which applies mathematical techniques to the memory partitioning problem. A polyhedral
model is used to represent memory access patterns in loops
and legal code transformations, and an integer lattice approach
is used for memory partitioning, where the objective is to: 1)
minimize contention, and 2) reduce “waste” (unused portions
of the partitions). [10] targets accesses of multi-dimensional arrays in loop bodies and proposed a closed-form linear mapping
from array accesses to bank indices to achieve zero conﬂicts
(and II=1 for loop pipelining); subsequent optimizations then

reduce the bank count and space wastage. [13] and [12] show
static analyses which look for hyperplanes in memory accesses
in loop bodies. The hyperplanes are described by a vector
and a linear transformation translates between accesses to the
original multi-dimensional array into accesses in the newly
partitioned banks. However, [7] shows that the hyperplane
solution does not always work due to a phenomenon known
as bank switching, wherein the output of one bank may
be required by multiple hardware accessors. Again, these
works are not centered on multi-threaded software, but rather,
partitioning of arrays accessed multiple times in a loop body.
The application of geometric (e.g. polyhedral) representations of memory accesses in a loop body to the memory
architecture synthesis problem are not directly transferable to
the related problem in the multi-thread memory contention
context. The static approaches presented focus on ﬁnding
conﬂict-free mappings, however, our approach allows for nonperfect partitions.

IV.

A RRAY PARTITIONING I MPLEMENTATION

Memory partitioning was implemented as a compiler pass
in LLVM, where the input is the original IR and the produced
IR is changed such that memory accesses to the affected arrays
are modiﬁed to access from the sub-arrays. The pass takes
advantage of the predicated load/store operations supported by
LegUp. Predicated loads/stores differ from regular load/store
instructions in that the memory enable signal is no longer only
FSM-state dependent, but also dependent on a precomputed
predicate signal. Predicates are typically the true/false outcome
of a comparison. Leveraging the predicated load/store, the
array partitioning pass can, for each memory access to a
partitioned array, create multiple predicated memory instructions for each newly created partition, where the predicate
is a compare instruction of the original index. The compare
instruction (icmp eq) will evaluate to true only for one of
these instructions at run-time. Therefore, the array partitioning
transformation does not require extra memory bandwidth.
It is worthwhile to explain the detailed behavior surrounding predicated memory accesses, arbitration, and partitioning.
Consider a four-thread program, where initially all threads
access a single array. When synthesized to hardware, contention and delays due to arbitration may arise because the
array, implemented as a logical RAM in the FPGA, has four
accessors and at most two ports.
To resolve the contention, assume the array is partitioned
into four pieces, where each thread accesses the partitions in a
near-exclusive fashion, for example, each thread accesses one
partition 95% of the time, but 5% of the time accesses one
of the other three partitions. In such a scenario, the hardware
implementation of each thread does indeed issue a predicated
access to all four partitions; however, it is only the access for
which the predicate is true that is sent to the arbiter. That
is, the accesses associated with false predicates do not create
contention in our implementation.

A. Available Partitioning Schemes
There are 4 supported partitioning schemes for multidimensional arrays: complete, block, cyclic, and block cyclic
shown in Fig. 1. These are similar to the schemes that are
supported by Vivado HLS. In the complete scheme, each array
element is designated to a separate partition. In the block
scheme, partitions represent contiguous pieces of the original
array. The cyclic scheme is an interleaved approach, where
array elements a ﬁxed distance apart are allocated to the same
partition. Block cyclic combines the block and cyclic schemes.
Partitioning is available in any single dimension of a multidimensional array. For the purposes of this work, our focus is
on globally declared data structures – i.e. those which are not
locally scoped and therefore, can be shared between multiple
functions or threads of the same function.
The speciﬁc partitioning scheme is based on several terms:
•
•
•

Number of Partitions (n): Number of total partitions
to be created.
Block Size (b): Size of contiguous elements in the
dimension of partitioning that constitute the partition.
Size (S): Number of elements of the multidimensional array in the dimension of the partitioning.

C. Limit to Power-of-2 Partitions
In order to access a memory location in the newly partitioned memory scheme, the new access will require both
the new partition number, as well as a new index into the
partition where memory location now resides. The equation to
determine the new partition number, pd , is:
pd = id / b % n

(1)

where id is the index of the access in the dimension of
partitioning, d; b is the block size and n is the number of
partitions.
The equation to compute the new index, new id , into the
partition is:
new id = (id % b) + id / (b × n) × b

(2)

The indices into the other dimensions of the array remain
unchanged since the other dimensions were not partitioned.
The above equations hold for the general case of block
cyclic partitioning. They can be simpliﬁed in the case of
complete, block, and cyclic. For example, notice that in the
case of complete partitioning, b is 1 and n is S, the size of the

array in dimension d of complete partitioning. Therefore, the
equation to determine the new partition number is simply,
p d = id

(3)

and the new index is simply equal to 0.
Observe that the above equations heavily rely on the division and modulo operators. These operations are potentially
costly from both the performance and area perspectives in
LegUp-generated hardware. For example, in the division/modulo module LegUp instantiates, the number of cycles
required is proportional to the bitwidths of the division/modulo
operands. This implies that the cycle-count penalty incurred to
compute partition number and index can override any cyclecount reduction afforded by partitioning in the ﬁrst place.
Consequently, we limit the solution space such that the
division operations can be substituted by right shift operations
and the modulo operations can be substituted by bit-wise
logical-AND operations, which are both trivial in hardware.
Table I shows the values of n and b that each partitioning
scheme allows. There is only one possible setting for complete
partitioning. In block partitioning, we can have any integer
value greater than 1 and less than S number of partitions and
our block size must be a power of 2 value greater than 1 and
less than S, where S is the size of the array in the dimension
of partitioning. In cyclic partitioning, we need a power of 2
number of partitions which is greater than 1 and less than S
and a block size of 1. In block cyclic partitioning, we must
have a number of partitions and block size which are both
power-of-2 integers greater than 1 and less than S. Section V-D
presents the solution space for a general multi-dimensional
array.

AUTOMATIC A RRAY PARTITIONING

A. Overview
At a high level, the automated array partitioning is implemented as follows: First, the multi-threaded software program,
without any partitioning applied, is synthesized to hardware
using LegUp HLS. The generated RTL is then simulated with
ModelSim under typical input vectors, and a memory access
trace is extracted, where, for each array/memory access, the
address and the ID of the thread making the access is tracked.
Following the trace generation, the trace itself, as well as
a hypothetical array partitioning scheme are inputted to our
memory simulator, which, for the proposed scheme, estimates
its performance beneﬁts. With the single HLS execution and
trace generation, we are able to assess the consequences of
various partitioning schemes. And, by simulating a variety of
different partitioning schemes, an optimal memory banking
architecture can be determined. We elaborate on the steps in
the subsections below.

B. Memory Trace Collection
We modiﬁed the RTL-generation of the LegUp HLS tool
to produce the relevant trace data in ModelSim simulation.
Speciﬁcally, a $display statement is inserted whenever a
request is made to a shared memory since it can be easily
detected through the request_in vector of the associated
arbiter. The information attached to each shared memory
request is the cycle of the initial request, the speciﬁc block
RAM being requested, the port name, the function trying to
access the RAM, the instance number in the case of multithreaded functions, and the address of the request to be used
later for determining possible partition schemes.
C. Memory Partitioning Simulator
The memory simulator is a program which aims to model
the arbitration of requests to a particular port of a speciﬁc block
RAM. The program is written using Python. The simulator
will, based on any partitioning scheme and an input memory
trace collected during the unpartitioned execution, determine
the number of port contentions that will occur, as well as
the cycle number in which the last memory request will be
serviced.
The program ﬁrst creates a representation of the unpartitioned execution memory accesses as a chain of nodes in
which each node represents a memory access and the edge
weights between the nodes represent the distance, i.e. the
intrinsic number of cycles between accesses. The distance may
not be the same as the number of cycles between accesses
in an execution trace since the trace captures cycles lost to
contention. Fig. 2 shows a series of scheduled accesses for
a program running 2 threads, as well as the memory access
chains that are created from the memory trace. The boxed
accesses represent the requests granted in that cycle, while the
unboxed accesses represent the accesses which stalled due to
contention. As seen here, the cycle difference between when
access 0 is granted and when access 1 is granted is 2. However,
the distance will measure 1 cycle, because the distance captures
the number of cycles between accesses in the absence of
contention.
Once the memory access chain is gathered, the simulator
will “execute” the trace, where the memory accesses are
scheduled according to the partitioning scheme under test,
since we know the order of all memory accesses by each
requester, as well as the speciﬁc addresses being accessed,
which can tell us which partition the access would belong to.
The simulator has an in-memory model of the round-robin
arbiter instantiated by LegUp and therefore, it is able to assess
cycles lost to contention, i.e. a requester waiting for a “grant”
from the arbiter.

Listing 1 shows pseudocode for simulating the scheduling
of a memory access trace for a particular array partitioning
conﬁguration, partitionConfig. Our approach bears similarity to event-driven logic simulation. Here, setQ is a set of
queues: one for each arbiter in the partitioning scheme being
simulated. Each queue stores the pending memory requests
for a port on a memory bank. Initially, all arbiter queues are
initialized to empty.

}

We commence simulation at the cycle of the ﬁrst memory
access (line 6) and enter the while loop (line 7). For
each arbiter present in the design (line 9), as speciﬁed by
partitionConfig, we use the present cycle, as well as the
trace T to populate the queue with active requests (line 10).
The populateQ function (not shown) takes accesses from
the trace T which occur at time cycle, and for each such
access, uses knowledge about the partitioning scheme to create
a request in a speciﬁc queue. Then, the executeCycle
function (line 11) uses an internal arbiter model to determine
the request in each queue which will receive the grant; this
request is removed from the queue. This process continues
until there are no more requests outstanding in any arbiterrequest queues and when the trace is empty (line 15). Upon
termination, the cycle variable holds the cycle index of
the last-serviced memory request. Partitioning schemes which
reduce this quantity are generally desirable.
D. Finding the Optimal Solution
We take a brute-force approach to ﬁnding the optimal partitioning solution. This means we iterate through all the possible
partitioning schemes1 , while predicting the number of cycles
needed in order to complete all the memory accesses collected
in the trace, as well as the number of cycles associated with
stalls due to memory contention.
To provide insight on the size of the solution space, the
total number of partitioning schemes that may be applied to
one multi-dimensional array is:
N U Mtotal = N U Mb + N U Mc + N U Mcmp + N U Mbc (4)
where N U Mb , N U Mc , N U Mcmp , and N U Mbc represent the
number of solutions for block, cyclic, complete, and block
1 We ignore schemes that are trivially non-optimal and that warrant no
further analysis, e.g. where the number of partitions far exceeds the number
of threads.

cyclic partitioning, respectively. We note that:
N U Mcmp = D

(5)

where D is the number of dimensions of the multi-dimensional
array; that is, for each array dimension, there is a single
complete partitioning. We also need to deﬁne a function Φ
that ﬁnds the largest power-of-2 number less than the input.
With reference to the variables in Table I, we have:
N U Mb = |Bb | =

D−1


log2 (Φ(Sd ))

(6)

d=0

where Sd is the number of elements in dimension d. The
solution-set size for block partitioning is equal to the cardinality of the set of allowed values for the block size (in each
dimension we have the option to choose any power-of-2-sized
block size). For cyclic:
N U Mc = |Nc | =

D−1


log2 (Φ(Sd ))

(7)

d=0

Likewise, the solution-set size for cyclic partitioning is equal
to the cardinality of the set of allowed values for the number
of partitions. For block-cyclic partitioning:
N U Mbc =

D−1
 log2 (Φ(S
d ))−1
d=0

log2 (Φ(Sd )) − i

(8)

i=1

The outer sum is over all dimensions. The inner sum is
the solution space size for each dimension. The inner sum
index i deﬁnes the legal block sizes for block cyclic partitioning: the block sizes are 2i , and therefore range from 21 to
2log2 (Φ(Sd ))−1 in powers-of-2. The reason that block sizes of
20 = 1 and 2log2 (Φ(Sd )) are excluded from the sum bounds is
that these solutions are standard cyclic, and block partitioning,
respectively (already counted above in the N U Mc and N U Mb
terms). For each legal block size, log2 (Φ(Sd )) − i counts
the number of ways the block size can be assigned to banks
(number of partitions).
Consider the simple case of a 2-dimensional array of
33 × 16 elements, D in this case is 2, S0 is 16 and S1 is
33. Let us take a look at the row dimension (1), |Pb | = 5,
|Pc | = 5, and |Pbc | = 10. If we elaborate the block cyclic set
we get |Pbc | = 4 + 3 + 2 + 1, where each term corresponds
to the number of solutions for when the block size is 2, 4, 8,
and 16, respectively.
The above represents the solution-set size for a single array.
When there are multiple arrays within the same program,
the exploration space becomes a Cartesian product of all
the possible partitioning schemes of each array, which may
become very large even for modestly sized arrays. The bruteforced approach for enumerating partitioning possibilities does
not scale well with the size of the solution space nor with the
memory trace size. In future work, a pruning approach can be
used to remove partitioning possibilities when they are known
to perform worse than other schemes. Large memory traces
will take longer time to process, to deal with this issue, we
can use a sampling approach, where smaller trace portions
can be gathered at various intervals in order to get a small but
representative version of the memory trace.

where partition type is one of the following ∗, b, c, bc which
stands for complete, block, cyclic, or block cyclic. For example, if we wanted to partition a M × N matrix into 2 blocks,
where the ﬁrst block contains the elements in all the rows for
columns in range 0 to N/2 − 1 and the second block contains
the elements in all the rows for columns in range N/2 to N −1,
then the partitioning scheme would be 0b2 which stands for
block partition into 2 blocks in the column dimension.

B. Partitioning Performance Results

From Table II we observe that generally multiple partitioning schemes may yield the same cycle count. However,
we know intuitively that partitioning schemes requiring more
partitions will yield designs with lower clock frequencies and
more area since higher numbers of partitions means more
arbitration logic. We will discuss area versus performance
trade-offs in the following section.

Matrixadd performs the summation of the elements of a
128×128 input integer matrix, where each thread is responsible
for the summation of a chunk of rows. Histogram reads a
32768 element input array and counts the number elements
which belong to a certain value range into a local array.
Matrixmult performs matrix multiplication on two 32×32 input
matrices – matrixA and matrixB, where each thread is
responsible for computing the results of a chunk of rows.
Matrixmult (cyclic) is a variation on the matrixmult benchmark,
where each thread is responsible for computing the output for
each row in a cyclic manner, where thread 0 will compute
the outputs of row 0, 8, 16, etc. Additionally, matrixmult was
modiﬁed such that each thread accesses matrixB with an
offset to a different set of columns to allow for parallelization
of accesses to columns. Matrixtrans performs matrix transpose
on a 128×128 input matrix, where each thread transposes
each row of the input for a contiguous slice of columns
into the output. For example, thread 0 is responsible for
transposing for all rows between columns 0 - 15 for the input
matrix. Matrixtrans (block cyclic) is a variant on matrixtrans
benchmark, where each thread transposes a chunk of rows of
the input for all columns into the output in a block cyclic
manner. For example, thread 0 is responsible for transposing
rows 0-3, 32-35, 64-67, and 96-99 for all columns of the input
matrix. Los (line of sight) consists of a 64×64 obstacle map
in which each pixel can take on the values of either 1 or 0,
where 1 represents an obstacle and 0 represents unoccupied
space and a human is assumed to be situated in the middle of
the obstacle map. The threads will sweep through the obstacle
map at each map coordinate and steps in the direction of the
human located at the center to determine whether there is an
obstacle between the beginning location and the human. If
there is, then that coordinate location is not within the line of
sight of the human and thus will be marked as 0 on the output
map, otherwise it will be marked 1. This benchmark is input
dependent and is not intuitive in terms of which partitioning
scheme is the most optimal.

The evaluation of array partitioning on circuit performance, as well as the accuracy of the memory simulator
were performed using 8 multi-threaded benchmarks: matrixadd, histogram, matrixmult, matrixmult (cyclic), matrixtrans,
matrixtrans (block cyclic), substring, and los.

A. Benchmark Description

First, we present the execution cycles reduction results in
Table II. The second column shows the cycle count for the
baseline unpartitioned case for the parallel kernel region only
(not including error checking); the third column shows the
cycle count of the partitioned cases leading to the lowest cycle
count also for the parallel kernel region; the fourth column
shows the cycle of the last memory access to the arrays
under partitioning, which will be useful for comparison in
Section VI-D; the ﬁfth column shows the cycle count speedup
of the partitioned over the unpartitioned case; and column
six shows the partitioning scheme(s) that lead to the best
cycle count. In matrixmult, matrixmult (cyclic), matrixtrans,
and matrixtrans (block cyclic) the benchmarks each contain 2
matrices, and both can be partitioned. The results presented
show the partitioning schemes leading to the best cycle execution for the matrix matrixA in matrixmult and matrixmult
(cyclic), and for the matrix input_array in matrixtrans
and matrixtrans (block cyclic). Since the access patterns for
the 2 matrices in these 4 benchmarks are transposed of each
other, i.e. for matrixmult matrixA is accessed row by row
while matrixB is accessed column by column, the partition
scheme which leads to the best cycles execution in one matrix
can simply be applied to the other matrix in the opposite
dimension. This means, the partitioning scheme leading to
one of the lowest cycle count for matrixadd is 0b16 for
matrixA and 1b16 for matrixB. The geomean speedup of
all 8 benchmarks is 2.21×.

factor for the ALUT (half-ALM) is presented as 0.05 in [14],
which we multiply by 2 to estimate the area of a full ALM. The
scaling factor for an M9K RAM block is given as 2.87 in [14],
which we multiply by 1.1 to estimate the area of an M10K
RAM. Notice that even among these “optimal” partitionings,
the normalized area-delay product ﬂuctuates between 0.31 to
0.63. The main cause of this is due to the high area cost of
partitioning in some of these schemes.
It is also important to observe that partitioning leads to
diminishing returns in terms of cycle count, but may incur
signiﬁcant area costs. Fig. 4a and Fig. 4b show the performance
and area of the matrixadd benchmark respectively under blockcyclic partitioning in the column dimension (0) for various
numbers of partitions and a block size of 2. Observe that the
execution cycles reaches a minimum for 8 and 16 partitions,

Fig. 5: Memory simulator predicted versus actual cycle of last

The goal of the memory simulator is to accurately predict
the schedule of memory accesses of the circuit under various
partitioning schemes from a memory access trace gathered
from an unpartitioned implementation of the circuit under
a representative input. The size of the exploration space is
described in Section V-D. In this evaluation, we perform a
prediction of the execution cycle count under all possible
partition schemes where the number of partitions does not
exceed 16 and compare the results to the results from Table II
in Section VI-B to see if i) the optimal partitioning schemes
were detected and if ii) the predicted cycle of last memory
access reported by the memory simulator matches the actual
cycle from ModelSim simulation.

age error for all cases of partitioning, where the number of
partitions is equal or less than 16, as well as the partition
schemes predicted by the memory simulator to have the lowest
last cycle of memory access. Fig. 5a shows the accuracy of
the memory simulator for the matrixadd benchmark, where
the horizontal axis plots the actual cycle of the last memory
access to the arrays of interest and the vertical axis plots the
predicted cycle of last memory access. The closer to the red
line the data falls, the more accurate the prediction. Fig. 5b
shows the accuracy of the memory simulator for the substring
benchmark. The absolute percentage error for the substring
benchmark is 16.52%. The source of error was determined to
be differences in scheduling due to different port bindings for
memory accesses between the original unpartitioned case, from
which we extract the memory access chain, and the memory
port binding during the HLS of the partitioned case.
For 7 of the 8 test cases, the memory simulator was able to
accurately predict the partitioning schemes which lead to the
lowest execution cycles. In the case of substring, the memory
simulator missed 1 of the 9 best partitioning schemes. These
results are encouraging since looking from the variety of best
partitioning schemes, we see that many of these schemes are
non-intuitive. This means that it is hard for a designer to
realize that the partitioning scheme 1bc4 16 for the benchmark
matrixadd leads to one of the best solutions. As seen from
the area comparison in Fig. 3, this solution actually leads to
the lowest normalized area-delay product. This is where the
memory simulator-driven automatic memory partitioning tool
becomes a useful tool in detecting multiple good solutions to
prune the exploration space for the hardware/software designer.
VII.

C ONCLUSION

Memory access is often a performance bottleneck in computer hardware. In this paper, we considered memory architecture synthesis in the HLS context, speciﬁcally in the synthesis
of parallel hardware from parallel multi-threaded software. We
implemented ﬂexible array partitioning as an LLVM compiler
pass within the LegUp HLS framework. The array partitions
are implemented as separate logical RAMs (banks) in the
hardware, with arbiters inserted to manage concurrent accesses
among threads. With the banked architecture synthesis, the
geomean speed up of the parallel execution cycles is 2.21×,
across 8 benchmarks.
As it is onerous for one to select an array partitioning and
specify it using specialized compiler pragmas, we devised an
automatic memory partitioning tool that uses a cycle accurate
memory simulator, which, with an accurate model of memory
access arbitration can predict with an average absolute percent
error of 2.09% the last memory cycle of access of our 8
multi-threaded benchmarks. The simulator can be applied to
automatically select the best partitioning for an array.

Future work will look at the interdependency of memory
bank architecture synthesis and the memory port binding step
of the HLS ﬂow, as well as how selective multi-pumping of
memories may be combined with the proposed partitioning
techniques. The brute-force partitioning scheme enumeration
approach can also be swapped for a smarter pruning approach
in order to make programs with multiple arrays tractable in
this trace-based solution.
