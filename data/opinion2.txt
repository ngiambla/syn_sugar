My maxtor onetouch 160g works as advertised.
Easy onetouch incremental duplication , and automatic incremental backup are very nice , and work well here are my own tips as a token of appreciation for cnet public service to users (i'm quite a newbie , don't take this as a too serious piece of advice).
1) first the maxtor unit configuration has to be done following step by step the useful paper manual.
I read it all and found a lot of useful information there.
2) quit skype , google desktop and some resident protection software can be a good idea before big back ups.
3) don't move the drive during use.
4) always quit your maxtor with the safe remove utility from xp.
5) do not overuse the unit , so that it does not get exceedingly warm.
5) always use a stabilized power supply (stabilizer) so that the electric power has not micro cuts.
6) when not in use it is a good idea to keep the maxtor unit switched off to save its inernal parts.
7) generally keep the unit in possibly a rather fresh and well ventilated area.
On the rear side of the unit there are some cooling holes which should have enough space for air flow.
8) use defrag from time to time for your computer as well as for your maxtor external drive (although it is quite long).
9) do not relie exclusively on your maxtor external drive to save your data.
It can be used best as back up for your computer data , but your data should be stored or preserved in two different places at least    your computer hard disk and your maxtor external drive for instance.
So in case of a computer crash or external disk drive crash , one set of your data remains intact.
10) if you can have norton ghost it is also a good idea to also back up your data on your maxtor external drive using ghost.
The advantage of ghost is that recovery can be a bit more simple to implement.
Partition , windows and service packs do not have to be reinstalled first with ghost after the crash , although it is the case with the retrospect express software provided with the one touch line of products.
11) after several years please accept that your external disk drive might be a bit worn out , and prepare to buy a new one.
I have had this drive for over a year and it has been very reliable.
I purchased a camera case for traveling and the power source requirement is sometimes a pain.
What i like best is that i do not have to carry my notebook computer wherever i go and/or i can plug into any computer to transfer files.
I've had this drive for almost 2 years and haven't had any problems with it.
The only thing i haven't like is the one    touch backup software.
It seems like it takes longer to get this running correctly than it is to just drag and drop what i need backed up.
I realize that does not work for everyone.
I purchased the drive in july of 2003 and immediately noticed the heat build up on the top of the case when using it for a short period.
I measured the temp and it does reach the high 80's       low 90's.
Way too hot.
This compares to the dell dimension pc operating in 60's.
At the time i called maxtor questioning why this unit had no cooling fan       it did not need one.
Well that is definitely a line , however i is assured they would stand behind the drive (for a year)       but not my data.
I bought an $4.
95 8 desk fan and it runs when the maxtor runs.
It sets about 10 away , aimed at the insufficent , natural ventilation holes in the front.
This simple cooling (air flow) drops the temp to the 60's    70's.
And another way to keep the data safe is only run the maxtor when you need to use it.
One touch is a fine idea , but continuous running or this drive with no additional cooling is its end.
From reading many reviews i can see it is a crash waiting to happen without a fan.
My maxtor drive and its 8 cooling fan are still doing a great job.
As a rule       the cooler electronics run the longer they last       maxtor ignored this rule in the poor cooling design of this unit.
I have had this drive for about a month and am very happy with it    so far.
I use it strictly as a network attached storage device and therefore am not able to use nor do i need the one touch feature.
Other posts regarding early failure may yet prove prophetic for my drive to.
It does get very warm after heavy use.
I will definitely come back to this forum and tell all if the thing fails in the next two or three months.
I do not know what the fuss is all about.
I've had my 160gb one touch for 6 months plus and i've had no problems.
I have it running 24/7 under my computer desk with limited air circulation and i've had zero problems.
I've never used it for backing up my internal hd and i've never used the software it came with.
I use mine for music , downloads and as a video scratch.
I'm a dj and using the drive as a portable jukebox combined with my laptop has made gigs so much easier.
No more hauling vinyl or cds.
I can now take over 7000 320kbps song files with me wherever i go.
Try doing that with vinyl.
After my computer's internal hard drive crashed , i reached over endearingly to my maxtor ext hard drive i had backed everything up onto , and it would not turn on.
At the end of the day it seemed to be a power cord problem (which is weird , no external damage , no rough handling) so i got most of my data back.
Maybe us whiners got a bad batch , but i'm thumbs down on this one too.
True also that it heats up to an alarming temperature.
I bought the maxtor one touch iii (160 gb) a few months ago to store my photos and music and other things that were slowing down my pc.
Earlier today , i tried to access my photos and realized that my computer is no longer recognizing the maxtor drive and there is no power getting to it.
After checking out all simple fixes , i called the maxtor / seagate help line.
Within a minute , the woman i spoke to is able to determine what is wrong (obviously they've had some experience with this type of problem) and informed me that the device had failed.
She told me that it's under warranty until may 2008 , so i will be able to have it replaced , but if i want the information off of the drive , i will have to pay to have that information recovered by their recovery service.
I contacted them and is informed that they would attempt to retrieve the information , and if they were successful i would be charged somewhere around $1 , 400.
I have all of my digital photos on here from the past three years births , parties , vacations , grandchildren you name it it's on there.
I said i didn't understand why i would have to pay when it is their defective merchandise which caused the loss.
The customer service attendant blamed me for not using at least two other forms of backup.
I'll admit that i is foolish in not backing up the photos to disks , and i wo not make that mistake again.
I am heartsick at the mementos that i have lost.
I have to wonder , though , which is more profitable for seagate / maxtor selling drives or charging customers exorbitant fees to recover information from their defective devices.
My backup harddrive just died.
I press the blue button (as i have done for over 2 years) and nothing happens.
There's no software button on my desktop to do a back up so the external drive now just sits there useless.
I've had two good years but the seagate website is indecipherable so just to keep my life easy , i'm just going to buy another.
But definitely not another maxtor.
This is supposed to be my backup.
It hardly gets used.
What a hunk of junk.
My sister brought to me this 200gb maxtor ext hd (onetouch ii) in december beggining (i live in brazil).
One month later my computer couldn�t recongnize it anymore.
I had moved all my digital photos to it and , suddenly , i couldn�t get then back.
The problem is we can�t do much thing with a usb device.
There�s no configuration , setups or anything else we can do to recover the data i wrote to maxtor because the 2 blue leds in front of the drive started to blink together , but the led code on the maxtor site doesn�t inform this situation after 6 or 7 asked and answers emails they couldn�t tell me what�s going on.
Like in brazil , these help desks centers are trully awful and they know less than we about they own products well , finnaly i asked maxtor if i sent the hd to us they would try to recover my data back.
They said no.
They would just give me another drive the important to me wasn�t the drive , but the data.
So , i realize it would be safer with me i made a research in the net about this drive and i learned 2 things   a lot of costumers had problems with this product and it is just a internal drive with a external case maxtor said to me i shouldn�t open the external case because i would lose warranty but , like i said , if i had spent the drive to us i wouldn�t see my photos again i oppened the drive and installed it internally.
It worked ok and i could get my data back.
So , now i have a traditional 200gb internal drive working fine i tell you , my friends , don�t use this drive for backups.
It�s not trustable.
This it a terrible hard drive.
It worked ok , but very slowly for the first few weeks.
I used it mainly as backup and extra storage for videos , mp3s , and pictures.
I have it partitioned into 2 drives.
The backup partition is lost once and i had to reformat , but luckily i did not loose any data.
The other partition is corrupted once before , but the data  magically  recovered.
Now it is having problems again.
Chkdisk is frozen and won't close , my computer won't open , the drive wo not stop for safe removal , and it seems that only the data that  is not  backed up is gone.
A 13gb folder subbenly became empty maxtor's support is only monday    friday , 8    5.
I am not availible during those times.
They do have email support (i just sent one) in addition to the non    reliability , it is slow.
On the computer it is connected to , it transfers at up to 130 megabytes per second.
On another computer with two internal drives , the transfer rate for backup is over 1000 megabytes per second.
With this drive it can take many hours to back up do not buy it , and if you have one , do not trust it for important data.
This external hard drive does not work.
I cannot get any of my files off of it.
I have tried to explain it to the company and they do not understand what i'm telling them.
I put all my music and picture files on it via drag and drop , and now cannot get them off.
I cannot get any access to the drive.
It tells me to insert a disk and obviously there is no place to insert a disk it is the disk.
I would never recommend this product and for sure will never buy another one.
Their ads are misleading since they claim it is so easy to use it's a nightmare.
Period.
This drive is fine the first three months you have it , then it turns into a nightmare.
I have lost more data than i care to think about using maxtor drives.
Buy lacie.
They are 100 times better.
