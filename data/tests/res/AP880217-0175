 A coalition of members of Congress announced Wednesday that they plan to sue the Census Bureau in an effort to force the agency to delete illegal aliens from its count in 1990.
 Some 40 members of the House joined the Federation for American Immigration Reform in announcing that the suit would be filed Thursday in U.S.
 The group contends that including the estimated 2 million or more illegal aliens in the national head count, which is used to distribute seats in the House of Representatives, will cause unfair shifts of seats from one state to another.
 Nonetheless, Dan Stein of the immigration reform federation contended that illegal aliens should not be allowed to be part of determining the political structure of the United States.
 Tom Ridge, R-Pa., said the Census Bureau should actually count everyone but that it should develop a method to determine how many people are illegally in the country, and them deduct that number from the figures used for reapportioning Congress.
