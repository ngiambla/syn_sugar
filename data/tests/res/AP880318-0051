 Thousands of peole prayed, cheered, danced, beat drums and observed other traditions today as a total eclipse of the sun darkened a wide area of Indonesia and the southern Philippines.
 A partial eclipse was visible across a wide area of Asia as far west as India _ including Southeast Asia, China, Japan and New Guinea as well as parts of Australia and the Pacific islands.
 Clouds obscured the solar spectacular in Jakarta, Indonesia, Hong Kong and in the eastern Mindanao city of Davao, where thousands of tourists and scientists had gathered to observe the eclipse.
 In Jakarta, Wilson Sinambela of the National Institute of Aeronautics said a total eclipse was observed in several parts of the country, including by about 1,000 tourists in the South Sumatra capital Palembang.
 He said thousands of Indonesians prayed and beat drums to herald the start of the eclipse, which began in southwestern Sumatra before heading on to the Philippines.
 In Kuala Lumpur, where a partial eclipse blocked out about 80 percent of the sun, some Malaysian Hindus visited temples to pray for protection against harm during the eclipse.
 In Kurukshetra, India, an estimated 1 million pilgrims dipped into the waters of the sacred Sannihit and Brahmsarover tanks after a public address system announced the start of the eclipse.
 In Baguio City, 130 miles north of Manila, pregnant women of the local Ilocano community rinsed their hair during the eclipse with water dripped from burned rice straws in a traditional ritual.
 The Philippines is Asia's only predominately Christian country. ``This phenomenon is a clear reminder from God for mankind to repent its sins,'' said Theresa Teopengco, a government employee.
 Officials said about 20,000 tourists and scientists from around the world had come to the southern Philippines to watch the eclipse, the last one expected here for at least 50 years.
