 If the two sides trying to force changes in the 1990 census both get their way, the results would nearly balance one another, a population expert said Wednesday.
 The Census Bureau is under pressure to exclude illegal aliens from its national head count.
 Groups which have filed suit to ignore the aliens contend large concentrations of them could result in in some states gaining seats in the House of Representatives at the expense of other states.
 Meanwhile, other groups want the final census totals to be increased to account for people who may be overlooked in the census _ most often blacks and Hispanics living in urban areas.
 At stake are the 435 seats in the House, which are distributed among the states on the basis of population. ``If both sides get their way, the only change would be a flip-flop of one seat from California to Georgia,'' said William O'Hare, director of policy studies for the independent Population Reference Bureau.
