 At stake are the 435 seats in the House, which are distributed among the states on the basis of population. ``If both sides get their way, the only change would be a flip-flop of one seat from California to Georgia,'' said William O'Hare, director of policy studies for the independent Population Reference Bureau.
 Using estimates of the number of illegal aliens and undercounted minorities, he said that deleting the one group and adding in the other would make little difference in the long run.
 The only change, he said, would be that California would gain five new seats instead of six, while Georgia would add two rather than just one. ``That's easy to understand, since there are so many undocumented aliens in California,'' he commented.
