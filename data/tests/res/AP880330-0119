 Meanwhile, other groups want the final census totals to be increased to account for people who may be overlooked in the census _ most often blacks and Hispanics living in urban areas.
 O'Hare told a breakfast briefing for Northeast and Midwest members of Congress that he estimates their region will lose 14 House seats following the 1990 census.
 Using estimates of the number of illegal aliens and undercounted minorities, he said that deleting the one group and adding in the other would make little difference in the long run.
 O'Hare's study of potential changes in House seats _ based on 1990 projections with no adjustments _ calls for California to be the big gainer, adding six House seats, followed by Florida with a gain of four and Texas adding three.
