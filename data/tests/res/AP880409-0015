 A hurricane expert predicts a turbulent summer in the Atlantic Ocean with more and fiercer storms swirling the seas, but says it's impossible to know if any of the storms will threaten populated areas.
 William Gray, a professor of atmospheric science at Colorado State University, said Friday he expects about six Atlantic hurricanes this year, the average for the last 40 years, but above average for the decade.
 The Atlantic has formed relatively few hurricanes in five of the last six hurricane seasons.
 Those years brought just two to five hurricanes each, except for the seven hurricanes spotted in 1985.
 He issued an early ``outlook'' Friday for the 10th annual National Hurricane Conference. ``It is also anticipated that the average hurricane which does form in 1988 will likely be more intense than have the average hurricanes of the last six years, except for the 1985 season,'' Gray said in a paper presented to the conference.
