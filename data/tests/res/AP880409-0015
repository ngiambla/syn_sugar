 A hurricane expert predicts a turbulent summer in the Atlantic Ocean with more and fiercer storms swirling the seas, but says it's impossible to know if any of the storms will threaten populated areas.
 William Gray, a professor of atmospheric science at Colorado State University, said Friday he expects about six Atlantic hurricanes this year, the average for the last 40 years, but above average for the decade.
 But Gray said his models of air pressure, winds around the equator and winds for ``El Nino'' periods, when eastern Pacific waters are warmer than usual, do not allow for predictions of when or where a hurricane might form.
