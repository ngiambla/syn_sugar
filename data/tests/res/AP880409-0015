 William Gray, a professor of atmospheric science at Colorado State University, said Friday he expects about six Atlantic hurricanes this year, the average for the last 40 years, but above average for the decade.
 The Atlantic has formed relatively few hurricanes in five of the last six hurricane seasons.
 Those years brought just two to five hurricanes each, except for the seven hurricanes spotted in 1985.
