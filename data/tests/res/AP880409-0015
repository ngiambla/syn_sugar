 A hurricane expert predicts a turbulent summer in the Atlantic Ocean with more and fiercer storms swirling the seas, but says it's impossible to know if any of the storms will threaten populated areas.
 The hurricane season officially begins June 1, and its most active period usually begins Aug. 1.
 Gray based his early outlook on the presence of light easterly winds at the equator and the approaching end of ``El Nino'' period.
 Gray predicted four hurricanes last season, and three actually occurred.
 Drought in West Africa is responsible for a drop in Atlantic hurricanes in the 1970s and 1980s, Gray said.
