(AP) </DATELINE> <TEXT> A tornado blasted through this North Florida town before dawn today, destroying several homes and a college library, blowing off rooftops, flipping cars and leaving four people dead and 15 injured, officials said.
 The tornado touched down at 4:30 a.m. just west of Madison, about 50 miles east of Tallahassee, and cut a 12-mile swath of destruction, authorities said. ``There was this huge roar and then I heard a tree crack out there and thought we were all gone,'' said Marie Prince, a Madison County sheriff's dispatcher.
 Fifteen people were injured, but none of the injuries was critical, according to Madison County Memorial Hospital administrator Jeannie Baker.
 A house-to-house search found no more bodies, but a man and a baby had to be freed from separate homes where they were trapped, Peavy said.
