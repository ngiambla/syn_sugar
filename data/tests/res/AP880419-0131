 Four people were killed north of town, said Sheriff Joe Peavy.
 He had no estimate of the damage.
 He said the tornado's sweep through town lasted under 30 minutes.
 Electric company workers were restoring power throughout the area.
 The lightning accompanied a tornado that moved through southern Houston County about 60 miles northwest of Tallahasse.
