 Two of the deaths occurred in mobile homes blown apart by the tornado, and four other houses were seriously damaged as well, said Madison County Civil Defense Director Bernard Wilson. ``It didn't leave any of it.
 Madison, a town of about 3,500 people, is the county seat of Madison County, a thinly populated tobacco growing area of piney woods, rolling hills and swamps on the border with Georgia.
 Two tornadoes struck near the towns of Malone and Bascom, about 100 miles to the west of Madison, said Jackson County emergency management director John Mader.
 Elsewhere in Georgia, trees and power lines were reported blown down, a barn was reported destroyed and a tin roof was blown off an old building.
 Tornado watches were still in effect across 14 southeastern Georgia and 15 northeastern Florida counties until at least five hours after the tornado hit.
