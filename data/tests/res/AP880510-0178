 The State Department said in Washington that it had received reports the PLO might target Americans because of alleged U.S. involvement in the assassination of Khalil Wazir, the PLO's second in command.
 State Department spokesman Charles Redman said the United States has been in touch with a number of Middle Eastern countries about possible PLO attacks against American citizens and facilities.
 He added that Arafat's interpretation of those contacts was ``entirely without foundation.'' Arafat spoke at a news conference in his heavily guarded villa in Baghdad, where extra security guards have been deployed.
 It read: ``You may be aware of charges in several Middle Eastern and particulary Palestinian circles that the U.S. knew of and approved Abu Jihad's assassination. ``On April 18th (a) State Department spokesman said that the United States `condemns this act of political assassination,' `had no knowledge of' and `was not involved in any way in this assassination. ``It has come to our attention that the PLO leader Yasser Arafat may have personally approved a series of terrorist attacks against American citizens and facilities abroad, possibly in retaliation for last month's assassination of Abu Jihad. ``Any possible targeting of American personnel and facilities in retaliation for Abu Jihad's assassination would be totally reprehensible and unjustified.
