 A single-engine airplane crashed Tuesday into a ditch beside a dirt road on the outskirts of Albuquerque, killing all five people aboard, authorities said.
 Four adults and one child died in the crash, which witnesses said occurred about 5 p.m., when it was raining, Albuquerque police Sgt.
 Walter Ramazzini Jr., 17, of Albuquerque, said he was sitting about 100 yards from the airplane when it crashed. ``He was going east, making a left turn from the airport,'' Ramazzini said. ``A gust of wind hit him from right to left. ``He did three banks.
 To correct for that, he banked right and he kept going and passed level flight as if to turn right,'' Ramazzini said. ``To correct again for that, he went again to the left ... and went nose-first into the ground,'' said Ramazzini, a student pilot. ``He hit the ground and cartwheeled over. ``All I saw was a puff of smoke,'' he said.
 It was sprinkling.'' He said he was among the first four people at the crash site. ``We went up there and there was nobody alive,'' Ramazzini said. ``You could smell fuel.
