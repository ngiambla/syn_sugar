 The statement by Slovenia's Information Ministry followed reports published by the Slovenian youth magazine Mladina that there had been plans for a military takeover of the republic.
 The ministry statement said the federal military council met on March 25 and concluded that ``dissident tendencies'' in Slovenia were part of a foreign-backed conspiracy to overthrow the country's Communist government.
 But it said there was no discussion at the meeting ``about a plan for action against special warfare in Slovenia.'' The term special warfare refers to subversive actions.
 The statement did not identify the foreign elements and said Slovenia police later challenged the claim that there was such a conspiracy.
 It said the police disputed the military council's conclusion at a later meeting between the republic's police authorities and Ljubljana's military command.
 It published a letter to Slovenia's Communist Party leader Milan Kucan from two student unions that said military action had been planned earlier this year, including the arrests of ``nonconformist journalists, writers and officials.'' The letter said military units would be used to crush demonstrations that were expected to be called to protest the arrests.
