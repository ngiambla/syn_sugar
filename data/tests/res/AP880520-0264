 An official statement issued Friday confirmed that federal military commanders met in March and considered ways to quell dissent in Slovenia.
 The statement by Slovenia's Information Ministry followed reports published by the Slovenian youth magazine Mladina that there had been plans for a military takeover of the republic.
 Slovenia is considered the most liberal of Yugoslavia's six republics and two autonomous provinces.
 The statement did not identify the foreign elements and said Slovenia police later challenged the claim that there was such a conspiracy.
 The police said ``they had no available data which would justify such evaluations,'' according to the ministry statement.
