 An official statement issued Friday confirmed that federal military commanders met in March and considered ways to quell dissent in Slovenia.
 The statement by Slovenia's Information Ministry followed reports published by the Slovenian youth magazine Mladina that there had been plans for a military takeover of the republic.
 But it said there was no discussion at the meeting ``about a plan for action against special warfare in Slovenia.'' The term special warfare refers to subversive actions.
 The statement did not identify the foreign elements and said Slovenia police later challenged the claim that there was such a conspiracy.
 It said the police disputed the military council's conclusion at a later meeting between the republic's police authorities and Ljubljana's military command.
