 The statement by Slovenia's Information Ministry followed reports published by the Slovenian youth magazine Mladina that there had been plans for a military takeover of the republic.
 But it said there was no discussion at the meeting ``about a plan for action against special warfare in Slovenia.'' The term special warfare refers to subversive actions.
 It said the police disputed the military council's conclusion at a later meeting between the republic's police authorities and Ljubljana's military command.
