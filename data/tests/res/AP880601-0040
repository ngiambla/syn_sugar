 A study has found that the U.S. death toll from a major hurricane could be far worse than previously predicted, the head of the National Hurricane Center said Tuesday to mark the opening of the 1988 Atlantic storm season.
 Forty-three million people live in about 175 coastal counties from Maine to Texas, and evacuating crowded urban areas and barrier islands is virtually impossible, Sheets said.
 There are not enough shelters to handle the added load and there are serious concerns how new glass-windowed high-rises would fare if lashed by hurricane-force winds during evacuations, he said.
 The first tropical depression of the year has formed, and remained stationary Tuesday night just south of the western tip of Cuba, or about 200 miles southwest of Havana.
 One of the two satellites used to keep track of hurricanes could fail this year, forecasters said. ``It's quite possible this year that we could lose GOES-West at anytime,'' hurricane specialist Bob Case said of the Geo-Stationary Earth-Orbiting Environmental Satellite, which records atmospheric conditions over the Pacific Ocean and part of the Western Hemisphere.
 If that satellite does stop working, GOES-East would have to be directed to move from its equatorial orbit over Brazil to a spot south of the Texas Gulf Coast, where it would provide a view of the Western Hemisphere with limited vision in the hurricane-spawning eastern Atlantic, he said.
 A typical Atlantic hurricane season, from June 1 to Nov. 30, has 10 named tropical storms with rain and maximum sustained wind exceeding 39 mph, six of which become hurricanes with drenching rain and wind over 74 mph, Case said.
