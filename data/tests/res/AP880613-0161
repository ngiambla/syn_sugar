 Guzman is the ideologist of the organization, but Morote is considered the military strategist of the guerrillas and the advocate of attacks against peasant communities in the highlands that have formed civil defense units on the orders of the military.
 Guzman, Morote and other Shining Path leaders went underground in the late 1970s before launching their guerrilla war, which has claimed more than 10,000 lives.
