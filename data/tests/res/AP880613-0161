 The colonel said Morote arrived in Lima a week ago from the northern highlands to coordinate terrorists attacks in the capital.
 Palacios said the attacks were planned this week to mark the second anniversary of prison riots in which security forces killed more than 250 rebel inmates.
 There have been reports in recent months of a growing rivalry between Morote and Guzman, and Mantilla said he did not discount the possibility that Guzman betrayed Morote to get him out of the way.
 Guzman is the ideologist of the organization, but Morote is considered the military strategist of the guerrillas and the advocate of attacks against peasant communities in the highlands that have formed civil defense units on the orders of the military.
 Guzman, Morote and other Shining Path leaders went underground in the late 1970s before launching their guerrilla war, which has claimed more than 10,000 lives.
