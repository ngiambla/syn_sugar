 Officials said the capture of Osman Morote, 43, considered the most radical leader of the movement, was the hardest blow to date for the rebels since they launched their guerrilla war in the Andean highlands in May 1980. ``Osman Morote is considered the No. 2 of the party and its military chief,'' the independent magazine Si said recently. ``For some Shining Path experts, Morote might even be, in practice, the true leader of the organization.'' Abimael Guzman, a former professor of philosophy, founded the Shining Path movement and is generally recognized as its leader.
 The Shining Path is seeking to overthrow Peru's elected government and install a peasant and worker state patterned after the ideas of Mao Tse-tung.
