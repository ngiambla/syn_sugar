 SCHMID Associated Press Writer WASHINGTON (AP) Lawmakers clashed Thursday over the question of counting illegal aliens in the 1990 Census, debating whether following the letter of the Constitution results in a system that is unfair to citizens.
 The forum was a Census subcommittee hearing on bills which would require the Census Bureau to figure out whether people are in the country legally and, if not, to delete them from the counts used in reapportioning seats in the House of Representatives. ``This is a fairness issue,'' said Rep.
 Noting that at times in the past blacks and Indians have been excluded from participation in government, he commented: ``I do not want to return to a time when some human beings are considered less than equal in the eyes of the law.'' ``Every census since the Constitution was adopted has counted all residents of the states, including both legal and illegal aliens,'' added Rep.
