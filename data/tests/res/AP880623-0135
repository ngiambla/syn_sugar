 Lawmakers clashed Thursday over the question of counting illegal aliens in the 1990 Census, debating whether following the letter of the Constitution results in a system that is unfair to citizens.
 Ridge, R-Pa., who contended that states with large numbers of illegal aliens benefit unfairly when their large population totals give then extra seats in the House.
 Constitution requires the Census Bureau to cound all the ``persons'' in the country every 10 years for purposes of reapportionment.
 It doesn't specify citizens. ``I am disturbed by the implication that undocumented residents of the United States are not `persons,''' Dymally said.
 Don Edwards, D-Calif. ``It was never the intent of the framers to include only citizens for apportionment purposes.'' And Rep.
 Bustamente, D-Texas, termed the worry over counting aliens ``hysterical,'' pointing out that the movement of Americans into western and southern states has had a much larger effect on representation than the presence of aliens.
 Goodling, R-Pa., asserted that counting illegal aliens violates citizens' basic right to equal representation by giving greater voice in Congress to states where the aliens live.
