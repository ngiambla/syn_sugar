 Air Force F-16 fighter jets crashed in the air today and exploded, an air force spokeswoman said.
 The accident occurred less than two hours after another F-16 crashed into the Black Forest.
 West German police said one pilot was killed in the in-flight crash.
 The Air Force spokeswoman, Capt.
 Gail Hayes, said the aircraft were on a training mission when they crashed near Bodenheim, about six miles south of Mainz.
 She said the aircraft, assigned to the 50th Tactical Fighter Wing at Hahn Air Base, crashed at 1:30 p.m. ``There was one person aboard each aircraft.
 West German police spokesman Hugo Lenxweiler told the AP in a telephone interview that one of the pilots was killed in the accident. ``The other pilot was able to eject safely,'' Lenxweiler said.
 Al Sattler said the pilot in the Black Forest crash ejected safely before the crash and was taken to Ramstein Air Base to be examined.
 The aircraft was taking part in a NATO military tactical air exercise being conducted from the Canadian air force base in Baden-Soellingen, Sattler said.
