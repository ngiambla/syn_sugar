 The Agriculture Department says it has been on top of the drought since March 1, monitoring the situation, setting up hotlines to handle worried callers and issuing enough statements to paper a thousand bird cages, easy.
 One of the latest informational gimmicks is a ``USDA Backgrounder'' listing the department's ``drought-related actions'' since the blotter-like furnaces began roaring across most of the nation. ``It was my idea, my memory isn't what it used to be,'' quipped Sally Michael, the department's deputy director of information. ``This helps me keep track of what we've done.'' Michael agreed during questioning by a reporter that the action list is lean on actual dollars going into the drought aid.
 The first lists 22 separate drought ``actions'' by USDA or its people, beginning more than four months ago.
