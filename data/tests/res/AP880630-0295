 One of the latest informational gimmicks is a ``USDA Backgrounder'' listing the department's ``drought-related actions'' since the blotter-like furnaces began roaring across most of the nation. ``It was my idea, my memory isn't what it used to be,'' quipped Sally Michael, the department's deputy director of information. ``This helps me keep track of what we've done.'' Michael agreed during questioning by a reporter that the action list is lean on actual dollars going into the drought aid.
 One involved meat purchases for school cafeterias and the other a credit deal for the sale of meat to Mexico.
 The first lists 22 separate drought ``actions'' by USDA or its people, beginning more than four months ago.
