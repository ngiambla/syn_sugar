SUBS last graf with 9 grafs to UPDATE with details of fires in Wyoming and California, new Michigan fires.</NOTE> <BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE> <TEXT> A lightning-sparked fire in Utah's Zion National Park spread out of control to 1,100 acres Tuesday, but rain helped firefighters hold the line on a 2,000-acre forest fire in Montana and two other major fires in Wyoming.
 Gusty winds spread a third Wyoming fire over 400 acres of the Bridger-Teton National Forest and forced the evacuation of a campground and summer cabins on Freemont Lake, a half mile from the blaze.
 A fire that scorched 1,130 acres in and around the Hiawatha National Forest in Michigan was linked to a vehicle exhaust pipe.
 Last night it sounded like every fire alarm in the area was going off.'' In California, a fireworks-caused blaze that swept over 2,200 acres near Yosemite National Park was declared contained at dawn Tuesday. ``We have evidence confirming that it was a bottle rocket,'' said Mary Hale, a spokeswoman for the California Department of Forestry.
