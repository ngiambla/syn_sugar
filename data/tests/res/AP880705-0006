 A lightning-sparked fire in Utah's Zion National Park spread out of control to 1,100 acres Tuesday, but rain helped firefighters hold the line on a 2,000-acre forest fire in Montana and two other major fires in Wyoming.
 Gusty winds spread a third Wyoming fire over 400 acres of the Bridger-Teton National Forest and forced the evacuation of a campground and summer cabins on Freemont Lake, a half mile from the blaze.
 Kentucky's Division of Forestry reported 85 fires burned 1,267 acres in the first four days of July, compared to an average of 18 fires and 165 acres for the whole month, spokesman Richard Green said.
 The evacuation in the Bridger-Teton forest was a precaution and the fire started to die down somewhat as temperatures dropped at nighttime, forest spokesman Fred Kingwill said.
 In California, about 190 firefighters battled a wildfire that burned 350 acres of brush Tuesday across steep terrain in an area of Los Padres National Forest untouched by fire in 64 years, said Earl Clayton of the U.S.
