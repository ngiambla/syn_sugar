 Meanwhile, illegal fireworks were blamed for causing a blaze that raged across 2,200 acres near Yosemite National Park in California over the weekend, and firefighters brought a four-day fire in Michigan's Hiawatha National Forest under control Monday after the blaze consumed more than 1,100 acres.
 The rain also allowed officials to cancel a 100-man patrol planned for Monday night. ``The forecast for the next two or three days is dry, with lower humidities and conditions more favorable to burning,'' said Damron. ``But this provides a real good reprieve and a chance to reinforce the lines and complete lines that we don't have yet.'' Four 20-person firefighting crews from Colorado, Utah and South Dakota were expected to arrive at the fire by Monday night, putting the total number of firefighters at about 430.
