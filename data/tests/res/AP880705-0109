 In southern Utah's scenic Zion National Park, firefighters tried today to contain a 600-acre fire that was ignited by lightning June 19 but had been allowed to burn in a small area.
 Forest Service spokesman Dale Bluedorn agreed, but said they will continue to keep patrolling. ``It may not be declared out until there's a three-day rain,'' he said Monday.
 A small contingent of firefighters who hiked into the Absaroka-Beartooth Wilderness on Monday in south-central Montana contained portions of a 2,000-acre fire that has been burning there since June 19, forest officials said.
