 A small contingent of firefighters who hiked into the Absaroka-Beartooth Wilderness on Monday in south-central Montana contained portions of a 2,000-acre fire that has been burning there since June 19, forest officials said.
 Three-quarters of an inch of rain on Monday helped slow a fire on 1,650 acres in the Shoshone National Forest in Wyoming, and rain also damped fires in Yellowstone National Park.
