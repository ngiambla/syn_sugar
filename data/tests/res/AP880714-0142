 The focus of the drought plaguing much of the nation has shifted eastward, but little relief is in sight for most areas, the National Weather Service reported Thursday.
 The new short-range forecast through next Monday calls for hot, dry weather to expand eastward from the Rockies through the Ohio Valley to the Mid-Atlantic states.
 Rapidly moving weather systems are expected to drag weak fronts along the U.S.-Canadian border, possibly triggering scattered showers in the extreme northern Plains and upper Mississippi Valley.
 Long-term drought conditions now cover a large area of the Great Lakes region and the Ohio and Tennessee valleys, the agency's Climate Analysis Center reported.
 And a separate climate assessment added that many areas now experiencing extreme drought have less than a 4 percent chance of recovering from the drought within 3 months.
 On Tuesday, the Agriculture Department announced sharp reductions in the anticipated harvest of many crops because of the water shortage _ and those projections were based on the assumption of normal weather from here on, according to department officials.
 The drought region now extends well into West Virginia and includes nearly all of Ohio and Indiana and much of Kentucky and Tennessee, the weather service drought advisory said.
 The national picture shows the current drought to be about equivalent to that of 1911, and still somewhat less severe than in several years in the 1930s or 1956.
 Recent rains have resulted in local flooding in Texas, but nationally streamflows are below normal, and even in Texas are expected to fall back to below average levels.
 In addition to Thursday's short-range forecast, the medium-range outlook through July 23 anticipates much of the nation will remain hotter than normal, particularly the Tennessee Valley, lower Midwest, central and northern Great Plains, northern Rockies and Great Basin.
