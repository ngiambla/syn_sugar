 The Forest Service has called on psychologists, sociologists and archaeologists to determine why fires are set. ``Part of it is tradition,'' Smallwood said. ``In the springtime, people used to burn the woods to allow grass to grow.'' A policy of open grazing, with cattle free to feed on any unfenced land, was allowed in the Ozarks until the 1960s, longer than in other wooded areas, Smallwood said.
 In the rare case of a conviction, the arsonist is likely to be put on probation or ordered to pay the costs of fighting the fire and replacing timber that was destroyed, Smallwood said.
