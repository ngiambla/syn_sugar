 A total of 14,200 acres of the forest, which covers 1.5 million acres mostly in southern Missouri, were burned during a spring fire season made more volatile by drought.
 On average, Smallwood estimates, 70 percent of the forest fires each year in Missouri are deliberately set. ``It's probably 90 percent higher than the national average,'' said Ron McDonald, Mark Twain's fire control officer.
 He said Mark Twain consistently is among the five forest districts with the worst arson problem. ``It's just been an Ozark tradition of incendiary (deliberately set) fires,'' McDonald said.
 The Forest Service has called on psychologists, sociologists and archaeologists to determine why fires are set. ``Part of it is tradition,'' Smallwood said. ``In the springtime, people used to burn the woods to allow grass to grow.'' A policy of open grazing, with cattle free to feed on any unfenced land, was allowed in the Ozarks until the 1960s, longer than in other wooded areas, Smallwood said.
 In the rare case of a conviction, the arsonist is likely to be put on probation or ordered to pay the costs of fighting the fire and replacing timber that was destroyed, Smallwood said.
