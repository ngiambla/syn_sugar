 A split, charred tree stump is a clue that lightning was to blame for a forest fire.
 And there are other ways to tell a fire was accidental. ``You eliminate all those causes, you're down to arson,'' said Dale Smallwood, a criminal investigator for Missouri's Mark Twain National Forest.
 He comes down to arson in most of his investigations _ and he and other forest officials believe the problem is often rooted in some regional traditions that are as hard to quell as flames.
 Arsonists set 172 of the 296 Mark Twain fires that have broken out so far this year, burning more than 9,000 acres, Smallwood said.
 He said Mark Twain consistently is among the five forest districts with the worst arson problem. ``It's just been an Ozark tradition of incendiary (deliberately set) fires,'' McDonald said.
