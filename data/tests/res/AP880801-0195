 On average, Smallwood estimates, 70 percent of the forest fires each year in Missouri are deliberately set. ``It's probably 90 percent higher than the national average,'' said Ron McDonald, Mark Twain's fire control officer.
 The Forest Service has called on psychologists, sociologists and archaeologists to determine why fires are set. ``Part of it is tradition,'' Smallwood said. ``In the springtime, people used to burn the woods to allow grass to grow.'' A policy of open grazing, with cattle free to feed on any unfenced land, was allowed in the Ozarks until the 1960s, longer than in other wooded areas, Smallwood said.
 Aesthetics even played a part: Shea and other researchers found that people living in areas where arson was common enjoyed the smell of smoke in the spring air, and believed the woods looked better ``burned clean.'' The Forest Service has attempted to counter the lore that can lead to burning.
 In the rare case of a conviction, the arsonist is likely to be put on probation or ordered to pay the costs of fighting the fire and replacing timber that was destroyed, Smallwood said.
 Last year, a judge ordered two arsonists to work weekends for the Forest Service. ``An arson case in the forest is very hard to make,'' he said. ``When you go out in the middle of the forest to a blackened area to begin an investigation, it's very difficult and frustrating.
