 By DON KENDALL AP Farm Writer WASHINGTON (AP) An annual Agriculture Department survey confirmed Thursday that a deadening drought will curtail the fall corn harvest by a third or more, resulting in higher retail food prices for months and years to come.
 However, government officials said bountiful crops in recent years has built stockpiles so high the United States need not fear actual shortages on grocery shelves and can even continue exporting food.
 The report came hours after President Reagan signed a $3.9 billion relief bill that he acknowledged won't bring rain to crops already sweltering, but hopefully will help farmers survive to plant again next spring.
 Wilson, the department's chief economist, said the drought may add 1 percent to the cost of food this year, 2 percent next year. ``Today's reports confirm that the drought has had a major impact on this year's crops,'' Wilson told reporters. ``But because of large pre-season stocks, total supplies are enough in most cases to assure and adequate food supply at home, satisfy foreign customers and meet our food-aid commitments.'' Sen.
 In addition to the reductions in corn and soybean yields, Wilson said production of some other spring-planted crops has suffered, including: oats, 206 million bushels, down 45 percent; barley, 288 million bushels, also down 45 percent; and sorghum, 561 million bushels, down 24 percent.
 Wilson said the drought could add 2 percent to the consumer price index for food next year. ``That's on top of an additional estimated increase in food prices somewhere in the region of 4 percent,'' Wilson said. ``So this would bring it up to a total of 6 percent.'' He also said the United States is ``looking at an export situation that is not as good as it was a year ago.'' He said production abroad would have to take up the slack in world food supply caused by the drought. ``Our figures here today would indicate that food production in other countries has not been cut that much,'' he said.
