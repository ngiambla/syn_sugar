 EDS: TOPS with 4 new grafs to move higher likely impact; picks up 2nd prv, ``Sharp reductions ...
 An annual Agriculture Department survey confirmed Thursday that a deadening drought will curtail the fall corn harvest by a third or more, resulting in higher retail food prices for months and years to come.
 However, government officials said bountiful crops in recent years has built stockpiles so high the United States need not fear actual shortages on grocery shelves and can even continue exporting food.
 The report came hours after President Reagan signed a $3.9 billion relief bill that he acknowledged won't bring rain to crops already sweltering, but hopefully will help farmers survive to plant again next spring.
 Wilson, the department's chief economist, said the drought may add 1 percent to the cost of food this year, 2 percent next year. ``Today's reports confirm that the drought has had a major impact on this year's crops,'' Wilson told reporters. ``But because of large pre-season stocks, total supplies are enough in most cases to assure and adequate food supply at home, satisfy foreign customers and meet our food-aid commitments.''
