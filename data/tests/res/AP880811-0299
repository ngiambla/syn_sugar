 An annual Agriculture Department survey confirmed Thursday that a deadening drought will curtail the fall corn harvest by a third or more, resulting in higher retail food prices for months and years to come.
 The report came hours after President Reagan signed a $3.9 billion relief bill that he acknowledged won't bring rain to crops already sweltering, but hopefully will help farmers survive to plant again next spring.
 The new surveys led USDA experts to predict the 1988 corn crop will total 4.48 billion bushels, down 37 percent from last year's harvest and the smallest output since 1983.
