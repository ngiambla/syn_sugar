 A death squad opposed to the Shining Path guerrillas has threatened to kill a district attorney if he investigates charges that soldiers massacred dozens of peasants, his office said Tuesday.
 The Rodrigo Franco Command, which has vowed to kill a Shining Path member or sympathizer for every person slain by guerrillas, issued the threat against District Attorney Carlos Escobar on Monday, according to his office in Andean city of Ayacucho.
 Escobar is investigating charges that troops rounded up dozens of peasants, accused them of being Shining Path members and killed them.
 Officials said the rebel raids occurred Sunday, at a police post and telephone relay station near the jungle city of Pucallpa, 325 miles northeast of Lima.
 The Rodrigo Franco group is named for an official of the government party killed the Shining Path killed last year.
