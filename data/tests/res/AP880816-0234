 A death squad opposed to the Shining Path guerrillas has threatened to kill a district attorney if he investigates charges that soldiers massacred dozens of peasants, his office said Tuesday.
 The Rodrigo Franco Command, which has vowed to kill a Shining Path member or sympathizer for every person slain by guerrillas, issued the threat against District Attorney Carlos Escobar on Monday, according to his office in Andean city of Ayacucho.
 The alleged massacre occurred in May near Cayara, a farming village 40 miles south of Ayacucho.
 Shining Path guerrillas began fighting eight years ago.
 The Rodrigo Franco group is named for an official of the government party killed the Shining Path killed last year.
