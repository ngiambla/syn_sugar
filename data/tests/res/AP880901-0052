 Here is a brief look at forest fire developments in the Western states: About 2.1 million acres are smoldering from 30 fires, the federal Bureau of Land Management said.
 Sue Mitchell, a BLM spokeswoman, said there were no active, or flaming, fires and all but a few firefighters have been recalled from the blazes.
 Two new fires flared Wednesday in the Sierra National Forest, one over about 1,800 acres west of Kings Canyon National Park; the other near Mariposa, outside Yosemite National Park.
 The Mariposa blaze destroyed at least one home and grew to 250 acres.
 Fire crews mobilized in the Star Valley of eastern Idaho after the 6,800-acre Trail Creek fire, fanned by shifting winds, broke through a control line and raced to within a mile of ranches and grain fields.
 The fire was the most threatening of 17 major blazes burning over more than 70,000 acres.
 The 7,900-acre Eagle Bar fire near Hells Canyon at the Oregon line burned out of control for the 12th day.
 Montana's three largest fires are burning primarily in wilderness areas: the 51,000-acre Canyon Creek fire in the Scapegoat Wilderness in northwest Montana; and the 43,000-acre Storm Creek fire and 42,000-acre Hellroaring Creek fire in the Absaroka-Beartooth Wilderness north of Yellowstone National Park.
 Oregon's biggest forest fire, the Tepee Butte fire, has burned 36,000 acres of grass and timber on the Wallowa-Whitman National Forest and the Hell's Canyon National Recreation Area.
