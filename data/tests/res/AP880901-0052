 Here is a brief look at forest fire developments in the Western states: About 2.1 million acres are smoldering from 30 fires, the federal Bureau of Land Management said.
 Two new fires flared Wednesday in the Sierra National Forest, one over about 1,800 acres west of Kings Canyon National Park; the other near Mariposa, outside Yosemite National Park.
 The Mariposa blaze destroyed at least one home and grew to 250 acres.
 The fire was the most threatening of 17 major blazes burning over more than 70,000 acres.
