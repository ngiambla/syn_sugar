 Pilot Parachutes To Safety After Military Jet Crashes in Japan TOKYO (AP) A U.S. military jet crashed today in a remote, forested area in northern Japan, but the pilot bailed out safely and was taken by helicopter to an American military base, officials said.
 The pilot of the F-16C, Maj.
 Vanedoe, was listed in good condition soon after the crash, the U.S.
 Forces Japan Media Liaison Office in Tokyo said.
 Vanedoe's home town was not immediately available, said a U.S. official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
 Isao Teranagare, spokesman of Iwate Prefecture (state) Police, said the pilot was taken by a Japanese rescue helicopter to the U.S.
 The U.S. aircraft, belonging to the 14th Tactical Fighter Squadron at Misawa, was on a routine training flight with two other F-16s in partly cloudy skies when it crashed in a forested area in Iwate, police said.
 On March 22, 1987, another F-16 crashed in the Pacific Ocean off Misawa, 360 miles north of Tokyo.
 The F-16, a powerful air-to-surface fighter, has a combat range of about 575 miles, according to Jane's ``All The World's Aircraft.'' About 50 F-16s are stationed at Misawa.
