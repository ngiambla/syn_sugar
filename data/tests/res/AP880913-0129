 By The Associated Press Coast Guard and Navy aircraft and vessels today searched for a crewman missing from an F-14 jet fighter that plunged into the Atlantic Ocean off North Carolina while practicing combat maneuvers, killing his crewmate, officials said.
 Six people were injured in another F-14 crash Monday after two Navy aviators bailed out of their jet over an airfield in the San Diego suburb of El Cajon, sending it smashing into a hangar.
 And a pilot in Utah escaped injury today in a third military training flight in two days.
 The crash off Hatteras, N.C., occurred Monday afternoon 22 miles east of Oregon Inlet, the Navy said.
 The identity of the dead aviator and his missing crewmate were not released pending notification of relatives.
 Five people, including the two Navy fliers, remained hospitalized today following the crash Monday morning in El Cajon 15 miles east of San Diego.
 The $35 million jet crashed upside down into hangars at Gillespie Field and exploded.
 The blaze ignited by the crash destroyed a hangar and an attached extension, but spared a nearby restaurant.
 Mike John, a spokesman for the Navy's Atlantic Fleet air force in Norfolk, Va., said the plane was engaged in mock dogfights with another F-14 and an A-4 jet in restricted military airspace off the North Carolina coast. ``It was flying a routine training mission,'' John said.
