 A Category 5 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson scale of strength has winds in excess of 155 mph and pressure less than 27.17 inches and has the potential for causing catastrophic damage. ``This would be considered a `Great Hurricane,' '' said Sheets. ``It's certainly in the top 10 percent as far as intensity, size and destructive potential.'' Gilbert was being compared to the hurricane of 1935, which slammed into the Florida Keys and killed 600 people, and Hurricane Camille, which devastated the Mississippi coast in 1969, killing 256.
 And while Sheets might appear to be spend most of his day with tiny microphones snaking down his back for TV interviews and fielding questions, he also writes most of the hurricane advisories issued every three hours and makes hurricane forecasts.
