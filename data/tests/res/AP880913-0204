 Dealing with his first major hurricane as director of the National Hurricane Center, Bob Sheets wasn't skipping a beat Tuesday as a multitude of reporters fired questions at him.
 Sheets, who was acting director during the 1987 Atlantic hurricane season and was named director in March, spent most of the morning on the sixth floor of hurricane headquarters beside a large monitor showing the destructive Hurricane Gilbert sprawled across much of the western Caribbean.
 But Sheets, rosy-cheeked and good-natured, didn't so much as flinch in his seat.
 I really don't think this is difficult.'' The transition from former Director Neil Frank, widely known for his distinctive style and flattop haircut, to Sheets, his dark blond hair carefully coiffed and wearing a bright pink shirt with a gray wool-blend jacket, has been a smooth one. ``He knows his job very well and he's a calm personality,'' Vivian Jorge, the center's budget analyst, said of Sheets.
 And interest in Gilbert has been high since it started packing hurricane-force winds over the weekend and by Tuesday afternoon became a Category 5 storm with winds of 160 mph and a central pressure of 26.66 inches.
