 Canadian Ben Johnson left the Olympics today ``in a complete state of shock,'' accused of cheating with drugs in the world's fastest 100-meter dash and stripped of his gold medal.
 In a middle-of-the-night meeting with Olympic and Canadian officials, family members, coach and manager, Johnson, 26, forfeited his most prized possession, the medal he'd had in his hands for only three days.
 The world's fastest human also was automatically suspended from international competition for two years and banned from Canada's national team for life. ``He appeared to be in a complete state of shock and not comprehending the situation,'' said Canada's chief of mission, Carol Anne Letheren. ``Ben was not able to discuss or articulate anything at that moment ...
 He was just not able to speak and it was a very difficult moment for all of us.'' A few hours later, he fled to the airport and boarded a plane to New York's Kennedy International Airport.
 Lewis did not gloat over his rival's fall. ``I feel sorry for Ben and for the Canadian people,'' he said today. ``Ben is a great competitor and I hope he is able to straighten out his life and return to competition.'' He said he did not want ``to fuel this controversy'' by commenting further.
