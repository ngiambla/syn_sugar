 Canadian Ben Johnson left the Olympics today ``in a complete state of shock,'' accused of cheating with drugs in the world's fastest 100-meter dash and stripped of his gold medal.
 Neither a spiked sarsparilla in his track bag, as his coach suggested, nor a switched sample at the lab could have accounted for the levels of steroids found in the tests, officials said.
 In a middle-of-the-night meeting with Olympic and Canadian officials, family members, coach and manager, Johnson, 26, forfeited his most prized possession, the medal he'd had in his hands for only three days.
 He was just not able to speak and it was a very difficult moment for all of us.'' A few hours later, he fled to the airport and boarded a plane to New York's Kennedy International Airport.
 It's also a moment of great sorrow for all Canadians.'' James Worrall, a Canadian member of the IOC, said Johnson ``has been killed'' as an athlete.
