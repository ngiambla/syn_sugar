 Canada's sole gold medal went to American Carl Lewis, who finished second in the 100-meter dash. ``It puts a dent in Canada,'' said Scott Shaw, a 10th grade student in Calgary, Alberta, said Tuesday.
 He said the allegations came from no one officially connected with the Olympic team and that he had heard similar, unfounded allegations about other atheletes in the past.
