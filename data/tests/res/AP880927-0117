 Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, who had thanked the Jamaican-born runner for the ``thrill of a lifetime'' after his record-breaking 9.79-second performance Saturday, called the drug scandal ``a moment of great sorrow for all Canadians.'' Sports Minister Jean Charest, who called the incident ``a national embarrassment,'' said Johnson will be banned from Canada's national team for life.
 But Johnson's family was left confused and outraged by the turn of events. ``My brother is not guilty,'' a distaught Rodney told reporters in her yard in the Toronto suburb of Rexdale. ``If you could cut him into a million pieces and test him over again _ my brother is not on drugs.'' Outside the townhouse, police were called in to control the crowd and the traffic.
