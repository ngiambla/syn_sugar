 Canadians were shamed, angry and saddened Tuesday that national hero Ben Johnson was stripped of his Olympic gold medal for using drugs to enhance his performance. ``I feel terribly sad for him,'' said Fergus Kilmartin, 36, of Coquitlam, British Colombia. ``I don't believe he did it on purpose.
 He hasn't got the guile to do that.'' A disappointed nation awaited the return of the sprinter after a urine sample was found to contain traces of anabolic steroids.
 Canada's sole gold medal went to American Carl Lewis, who finished second in the 100-meter dash. ``It puts a dent in Canada,'' said Scott Shaw, a 10th grade student in Calgary, Alberta, said Tuesday.
