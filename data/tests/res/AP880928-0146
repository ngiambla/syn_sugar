 The stripping of Ben Johnson's Olympic gold medal in a drug scandal has wounded Canadian pride and shamed a nation hungry for a hero to replace hockey superstar Wayne Gretzky. ``It's like Wayne Gretzky getting run over by a car,'' said Pat Reid, the Canadian high-jump coach.
 George Astaphan, Johnson's personal physician, and Larry Heidebrecht, Johnson's agent, insisted the sprinter had not taken stanzolol. ``The only thing we can say is that it is a tragedy, a mistake or sabotage,'' Heidebrecht said.
 It was unheroic conduct for the world's fastest human, who had been awarded the Order of Canada and a medal from Queen Elizabeth at the Commonwealth Games.
 Johnson's disgrace was heralded in Canadian headlines such as ``Fool's Gold,'' ``Black Day For Canada,'' ``Seconds Of Glory, Years Of Shame,'' ``From Fame To Shame,'' and ``Big Ben is Now Has-Ben.'' ``We're feeling low.
 Trent Frayne, sports columnist for the Globe and Mail of Toronto, said Johnson's victory was the biggest event in Canada since a national team beat the Soviet Union in a seven-game hockey series in 1972.
