 Ben Johnson knowingly took steroids and those close close to the runner also were aware of it, fellow Canadian Olympic sprinter Angella Issajenko was quoted as saying in an interview published Sunday.
 Johnson _ stripped of his Olympic gold medal in the 100-meter final after he tested positive for the banned steroid stanozolol _ also was taking steroids when he set a world sprint record last summer in Rome, the Toronto Star newspaper quoted Ms.
 Issajenko previously accused a therapist of giving her and Johnson steroids without their knowledge but later retracted the statement.
 Francis, meanwhile, has said the test result ``defies all logic'' and could only be explained ``by deliberate manipulation of the testing process.'' Ms.
 Issajenko, 30, was quoted as saying she had first-hand knowledge Johnson received steroids from Astaphan from 1984 to 1986 but ``Ben was going on his own to Jamie after that.'' She also said Astaphan was administering steroids to Johnson when he set a 9.83-second world record in the 100-metre sprint at the world championships in Rome.
