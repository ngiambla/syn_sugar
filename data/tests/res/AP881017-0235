 For the British, the change wrought by what many call the ``chunnel'' will be enormous.
 Eurotunnel, the Anglo-French consortium that will own the tunnel, is urging British Rail to speed its plans.
 The timetable calls for 650 feet a week and Kirkland is confident of reaching it.
 Tunneling machines simultaneously dig, remove rock and put up tunnel walls.
 In an emergency like flooding, the cylindrical head of the machine can expand to become a cork, blocking off the water and spraying concrete into the cavity to seal the leak.
