 $Adv30 For Release Sunday, Oct. 30, or Thereafter A colossal tunneling machine is boring beneath the English Channel from the white cliffs of Dover, pursuing a dream born in Napoleon's time that is coming true at last.
 Another is digging from the French coast in what the tunnel builders call the largest civil engineering project now under way in the world.
 Tunneling speed at the Dover end is less than 15 feet an hour and the machine boring from the geologically more complex French end moves even slower, which is why the tunnel will not open until 1993.
 Some wonder whether Britain will be ready for it. ``People still question whether the tunnel will be complete in May 1993 and that's ridiculous,'' says Kathy Watson, co-author of a book on the project. ``They're still arguing about whether it will introduce rabies into this country, or let in terrorists.'' ``They discuss it in terms of their being an island race, with a channel that has kept out invaders,'' she said in an interview.
