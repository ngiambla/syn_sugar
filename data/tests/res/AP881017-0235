 A colossal tunneling machine is boring beneath the English Channel from the white cliffs of Dover, pursuing a dream born in Napoleon's time that is coming true at last.
 The 31-mile tunnel, 24 miles of it underwater, will cut the London-Paris journey from six hours to three, as fast as a scheduled airline.
 It will enable freight to travel on one train instead of being shifted to trucks for a cross-channel ferry trip subject to weather and shipping strikes.
 For continental Europeans, accustomed to long-distance rail travel, the tunnel is but a small spur on a vast network stretching to Moscow and beyond.
 Britain's entry into the European Economic Community engendered a spirit of unity and the digging began again in 1974, but two years later a new British government shelved the project.
 He says the entire cost of 5.2 billion pound ($8.8 billion) project is privately financed and cancellation would cost the governments ``enormous penalties'' to shareholders.
 Also, the governments signed a tunnel treaty in February 1986 and both would have to agree to cancellation. ``There's no way that politicians will cancel this project,'' Kirkland said in an interview. ``It's quite difficult to get one government to agree.
 From a a rate of 380 feet a week, the pace quickly accelerated and recently achieved a week's record of 480 feet, Kirkland said.
 In an emergency like flooding, the cylindrical head of the machine can expand to become a cork, blocking off the water and spraying concrete into the cavity to seal the leak.
 Eurotunnel will run shuttle trains once every three minutes at peak times between terminals near Folkestone and Calais, and British Rail and the Frenh state railroad will operate trains from London and Paris.
