 Hurricane Joan's 80 mph winds churned across the open Caribbean today on an unusual southern path that has forecasters puzzling over its potential strength and possible landfall.
 The hurricane was moving west at 10 mph and was expected to continue that motion through today.
 As a tropical storm with 45 mph winds, Joan slowly built its strength as it skimmed Colombia's coast, baffling forecasters who had predicted it to weaken.
 On its present path, it would be at least 48 hours before the main part of the hurricane reached Central America, Gross said late Monday.
 Hurricane strength is 74 mph.
