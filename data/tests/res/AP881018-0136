 There was a report that the storm left 50 people dead or missing in a town in Colombia the day before. ``Joan is one of a kind,'' said Jim Gross, a meteorologist at the National Hurricane Center. ``You just don't see many hurricanes that take this course and hug the coast.'' In Colombia, an official of the state of Bolivar in the northern part of the country said the storm triggered flooding in the town of Carmen de Bolivar, about 360 miles north of the capital of Bogota.
 Water roared down three gullies in the town as the storm passed Monday, Victor Leon Mendoza, a state government administrator, told the Colombian radio chain RCN. ``Preliminary reports from the mayor's office indicate that about 50 persons are dead or missing'' in the town, he said.
 At noon EDT today, Joan's center was near latitude 11.1 north and longitude 76.3 west, about 70 miles west of the Colombian coast and about 380 miles east of the island of San Andres off the coast of Nicaragua.
 Panama issued a hurricane watch for its north coast, and Colombia issued a hurricane watch for San Andres, which is part of Colombia even though it is located close to Nicaragua.
 It reached hurricane force Monday night and its center began to become better defined, a sign the system could intensify over open water into the western Caribbean, forecasters said.
 Gilbert, the most devastating hurricane in recent years, left more than 300 people dead and caused billions of dollars damage as it tore through Jamaica, the Cayman Islands and Mexico's Yucatan peninsula last month.
