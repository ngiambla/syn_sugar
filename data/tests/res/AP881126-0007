 Further study of a newly isolated hormone found in the pancreases of diabetics may lead to new treatments for the most common form of the disease, a scientist says. ``We have a lot of evidence that this is likely to be, if not the final cause, at least a major part of the disease process,'' said New Zealand biochemist Garth Cooper.
 The research ``opens the door to the scientific study of the disease at a level that wasn't possible before and potentially the mechanisms that we uncover may be very wide ranging,'' he said.
 Cooper, who has been working with scientists at Oxford University, described the hormone research this week at the 13th International Diabetes Federation Congress in Sydney, Australia.
 In his presentation, Cooper said the hormone, dubbed ``amylin,'' was normally undetectable but found in high levels in the pancreases of diabetics.
 Amylin appears to be responsible for the obesity, reduced insulin secretion and the reduced effectiveness of insulin observed in Type II diabetes, he said.
 In Type II diabetes, also called non-insulin-dependent diabetes, the body's insulin is not effective and blood sugar levels rise too high.
 Scientists already knew of another pancreatic hormone that blocks insulin, but it is not found in abnormal levels in diabetics, said Pi-Sunyer, director of the endocrinology, diabetes and nutrition division at St.
