 Sawyer Air Force Base, officials said.
 The plane, normally equipped to carry nuclear bombs, crashed about 1:15 a.m., said Lt.
 Naomi Siegal, a spokeswoman at the Strategic Air Command installation.
 No weapons were aboard, said Lt.
 The crew was practicing landings after a seven-hour training flight when it crashed during one of its touch-and-go approaches, Peck said.
 All three sections of the plane burned on impact, said Senior Airman Tim Sanders, a base spokesman.
 The crew members crawled or were helped out of the front section of the aircraft, he said.
 Phillips, 28, a radar navigator from Folkston, Ga.; 1st Lt.
 Ann Parent, a spokeswoman for Marquette General Hospital, said Hartney and Debruzzi were in fair condition, Phillips and Vallie were in stable condition, McCarrick was in satisfactory condition and Kroeger was in serious condition.
 Hartney was the aircraft commander, but Debruzzi also was qualified to fly the plane, Bailey said.
