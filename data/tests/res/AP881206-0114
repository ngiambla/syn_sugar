 A B-52 bomber crashed and burst into flames early today on a runway while practicing ``touch-and-go'' landings at K.I.
 The crew was practicing landings after a seven-hour training flight when it crashed during one of its touch-and-go approaches, Peck said.
 All three sections of the plane burned on impact, said Senior Airman Tim Sanders, a base spokesman.
 Herrmann and Smith were listed in stable condition at the base hospital, said Technical Sgt.
 Hartney was the aircraft commander, but Debruzzi also was qualified to fly the plane, Bailey said.
 Peck said a board of officers will investigate the accident, adding weather did not appear to be a factor in the crash.
 The eight-engine B-52, which was deployed in the early 1950s, is the military's biggest bomber, with a wingspan of 185 feet and a maximum takeoff weight of 488,000 pounds.
 A B-52 bomber with radar problems crashed in Arizona'a Monument Valley in October 1984, killing two crew members, after its wings clipped a mesa.
 The Air Force has had more trouble recently with the B-52's successor, the B-1B bomber.
 On Nov. 8, a B-1B crashed and burned in a field near Dyess Air Force Base, Texas.
