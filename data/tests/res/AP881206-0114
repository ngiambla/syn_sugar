 A B-52 bomber crashed and burst into flames early today on a runway while practicing ``touch-and-go'' landings at K.I.
 All three sections of the plane burned on impact, said Senior Airman Tim Sanders, a base spokesman.
 Herrmann and Smith were listed in stable condition at the base hospital, said Technical Sgt.
 Hartney was the aircraft commander, but Debruzzi also was qualified to fly the plane, Bailey said.
 A B-52 bomber with radar problems crashed in Arizona'a Monument Valley in October 1984, killing two crew members, after its wings clipped a mesa.
 The Air Force has had more trouble recently with the B-52's successor, the B-1B bomber.
 On Nov. 8, a B-1B crashed and burned in a field near Dyess Air Force Base, Texas.
