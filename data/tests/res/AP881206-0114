 A B-52 bomber crashed and burst into flames early today on a runway while practicing ``touch-and-go'' landings at K.I.
 All three sections of the plane burned on impact, said Senior Airman Tim Sanders, a base spokesman.
 Hartney was the aircraft commander, but Debruzzi also was qualified to fly the plane, Bailey said.
 The Air Force has had more trouble recently with the B-52's successor, the B-1B bomber.
 On Nov. 8, a B-1B crashed and burned in a field near Dyess Air Force Base, Texas.
