 Sawyer Air Force Base, officials said.
 All eight crew members survived.
 The plane, normally equipped to carry nuclear bombs, crashed about 1:15 a.m., said Lt.
 No weapons were aboard, said Lt.
 The crew was practicing landings after a seven-hour training flight when it crashed during one of its touch-and-go approaches, Peck said.
 During such maneuvers, landing gears touch the ground but the plane doesn't land.
 All three sections of the plane burned on impact, said Senior Airman Tim Sanders, a base spokesman.
 The crew members crawled or were helped out of the front section of the aircraft, he said.
 Members of the crew suffered broken bones, but no one was burned, said Capt.
 Senior Airman Tim Sanders, another base spokesman, said those aboard were Capt.
 Mark Hartney, 29, an aircraft commander from Mulberry, Fla.; 1st Lt.
 Debruzzi, 26, a pilot from New Brighton, Minn.; Capt.
 Phillips, 28, a radar navigator from Folkston, Ga.; 1st Lt.
 Daniel McCarrick, 25, an electronic warfare officer from Succasunna, N.J.; Airman 1st Class, Joseph A.
 Kroeger, 52, an instructor pilot from Fountain Hills, Ariz.; and 1st Lt.
 Ann Parent, a spokeswoman for Marquette General Hospital, said Hartney and Debruzzi were in fair condition, Phillips and Vallie were in stable condition, McCarrick was in satisfactory condition and Kroeger was in serious condition.
 Herrmann and Smith were listed in stable condition at the base hospital, said Technical Sgt.
 Hartney was the aircraft commander, but Debruzzi also was qualified to fly the plane, Bailey said.
 Peck said it was not unusual for B-52 training missions to be out at that hour. ``Crews have to be trained to fly at any time of the day or night in any weather,'' he said.
 In other accidents involving B-52s, a bomber was damaged when a pilot aborted a takeoff and overshot a runway at Castle Air Force Base in central California on Feb. 11.
