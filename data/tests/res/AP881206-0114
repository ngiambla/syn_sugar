 A B-52 bomber crashed and burst into flames early today on a runway while practicing ``touch-and-go'' landings at K.I.
 Peck said a board of officers will investigate the accident, adding weather did not appear to be a factor in the crash.
 The eight-engine B-52, which was deployed in the early 1950s, is the military's biggest bomber, with a wingspan of 185 feet and a maximum takeoff weight of 488,000 pounds.
 In other accidents involving B-52s, a bomber was damaged when a pilot aborted a takeoff and overshot a runway at Castle Air Force Base in central California on Feb. 11.
 One of the $280 million B-1Bs was destroyed after smashing onto a runway at Ellsworth Air Force Base, S.D., during a training flight on Nov. 17.
