 STEICHEN Associated Press Writer BONN, West Germany (AP) A top West German military official said Saturday that the fiery crash of a U.S.
 Air Force jet that killed six people will further erode popular support for national defense programs.
 Wellershoff was referring to recent polls indicating dwindling public support for defense spending and increasing dissatisfaction over disruptive and often deadly military training maneuvers. ``I am alarmed that many West Germans have lost sight of the hard facts (of defense realities) in their hopes for continued peace,'' which hinge on West Germany's and NATO's security preparedness, he said.
