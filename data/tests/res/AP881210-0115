 Eds: Leads with 6 grafs to change `issues' to `programs' in lede and fix typo in 6th graf pvs, ``We are...'' Pickup 7th graf pvs,``Wellershoff was...'' A top West German military official said Saturday that the fiery crash of a U.S.
 Air Force jet that killed six people will further erode popular support for national defense programs.
 Later Saturday, at least 4,000 people took part in a torchlight vigil and procession in downtown Remscheid to remember the victims and to demand an end to low-level flight training missions.
 Wellershoff was referring to recent polls indicating dwindling public support for defense spending and increasing dissatisfaction over disruptive and often deadly military training maneuvers. ``I am alarmed that many West Germans have lost sight of the hard facts (of defense realities) in their hopes for continued peace,'' which hinge on West Germany's and NATO's security preparedness, he said.
