 In an interview with the Welt am Sonntag newspaper, the inspector general of West Germany's military said the crash was certain to have a serious impact on already sinking public support for defense issues. ``We are in a very difficult psychological situation,'' Dieter Wellershoff was quoted as saying.
 Wellershoff was referring to recent polls indicating dwindling public support for defense spending and increasing dissatisfaction over disruptive and often deadly military training maneuvers. ``I am alarmed that many West Germans have lost sight of the hard facts (of defense realities) in their hopes for continued peace,'' which hinge on West Germany's and NATO's security preparedness, he said.
 Air Force said in a statement Saturday that the pilot of the A-10 ``inadvertently flew into clouds'' while attempting to join in close formation with another aircraft.
