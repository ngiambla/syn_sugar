 The chairman of the House Agriculture Committee says hearings are planned next year into how the U.S.
 Forest Service handled last summer's stubborn wildfires that scorched the West, including one-third of Yellowstone National Park. ``The major problem is that in speaking to people from the area, you speak to two and you get three opinions,'' says Rep.
 The hearings will focus on fire fighting policies, rehabilitation of charred areas and on scientific research being done on the summer fires, said a subcommittee staff member.
 The committee will consider a uniform pesticide labeling law and legislation to protect ground water from agricultural pesticides and fertilizers, de la Garza said.
 The Forest and National Park Service spent a combined $300 million fighting the summer fires, the Forest Service said.
