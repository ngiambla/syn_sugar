 A recommended halt to the government's ``let it burn'' forest fire policy probably would be over by the start of the Western fire season next spring, according to the co-chairman of a panel that suggested the moratorium.
 Experts say fire renews forests, giving new species a chance to grow, encouraging wildlife and recycling nutrients.
 The agencies involved should make sure that fire management plans conform to departmental policies, that employees understand the policies, that everybody is using a common vocabulary and that agencies have agreed beforehand what to do if fires threaten to move across administrative boundaries, the report said. ``No ... natural fires are to be allowed until fire management plans meet these standards,'' the report said.
