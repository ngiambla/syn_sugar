 A recommended halt to the government's ``let it burn'' forest fire policy probably would be over by the start of the Western fire season next spring, according to the co-chairman of a panel that suggested the moratorium.
 Experts say fire renews forests, giving new species a chance to grow, encouraging wildlife and recycling nutrients.
 But it also said that ``in some cases the social and economic effects'' of allowing a forest fire to burn ``may be unacceptable.'' The panel suggested a temporary halt to the ``let it burn'' policy, saying the Forest Service and the National Park Service needed more time to refine their fire management plans. ``My guess is that the moratorium would be finished by the beginning of the Western fire season, which is the middle of May,'' Charles Philpot, co-chairman of the review panel, told a news conference.
