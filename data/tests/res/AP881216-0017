 A recommended halt to the government's ``let it burn'' forest fire policy probably would be over by the start of the Western fire season next spring, according to the co-chairman of a panel that suggested the moratorium.
 The panel, in recommendations Thursday to the secretaries of agriculture and interior, said there were environmental benefits to allowing fires in national parks and wilderness areas to burn.
 Residents in the fire vicinity complained bitterly that the park, tourism and the very air they breathed were being ruined by the failure to control the fires.
 The report said no fires in national parks and wilderness areas should be allowed to burn until government fire management plans are improved and strengthened.
 It said actual fire management plans often have not spelled out when natural fires would be allowed to burn and when they would be put out.
