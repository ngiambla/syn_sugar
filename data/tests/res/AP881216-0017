 A recommended halt to the government's ``let it burn'' forest fire policy probably would be over by the start of the Western fire season next spring, according to the co-chairman of a panel that suggested the moratorium.
 The panel, in recommendations Thursday to the secretaries of agriculture and interior, said there were environmental benefits to allowing fires in national parks and wilderness areas to burn.
 Experts say fire renews forests, giving new species a chance to grow, encouraging wildlife and recycling nutrients.
 The panel was assembled last September after the worst fire season ever in drought-primed Yellowstone National Park.
 The report said no fires in national parks and wilderness areas should be allowed to burn until government fire management plans are improved and strengthened.
