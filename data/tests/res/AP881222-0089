 Here, at a glance, are developments today involving the crash of Pan American World Airways Flight 103 Wednesday night in Lockerbie, Scotland, that killed all 259 people aboard and more than 20 people on the ground: The jumbo jet, a Boeing 747, apparently exploded in the air before crashing and investigators focused on terrorist threats to place a bomb on a Pan Am airliner.
 The crash occurred 54 minutes after takeoff from London's Heathrow Airport following a routine climb to a cruising altitude of 31,000 feet.
 Scottish Secretary Malcom Rifkind, the chief British official at the site, said the widespread wreckage indicated ``the aircraft clearly experienced some form of explosion.'' The wreckage of the 747 scattered bodies and debris over 10 miles of countryside and ravaged the village of Lockerbie.
 David Kyd, chief public relations officer, said ``it would seem to us that the most likely hypothesis is an explosion aboard,'' and that structural problems were unlikely to have been involved in the crash because of the sudden loss of contact with the plane.
 The State Department warned U.S. embassies that a bomb threat had been made against Pan Am jetliners flying from Frankfurt to the United States 2{ weeks ago and the Federal Aviation Administration told Pan Am this month that the airline might be the target of a terrorist bombing.
