 Here, at a glance, are developments today involving the crash of Pan American World Airways Flight 103 Wednesday night in Lockerbie, Scotland, that killed all 259 people aboard and more than 20 people on the ground: The jumbo jet, a Boeing 747, apparently exploded in the air before crashing and investigators focused on terrorist threats to place a bomb on a Pan Am airliner.
 The crash occurred 54 minutes after takeoff from London's Heathrow Airport following a routine climb to a cruising altitude of 31,000 feet.
 Scottish Secretary Malcom Rifkind, the chief British official at the site, said the widespread wreckage indicated ``the aircraft clearly experienced some form of explosion.'' The wreckage of the 747 scattered bodies and debris over 10 miles of countryside and ravaged the village of Lockerbie.
