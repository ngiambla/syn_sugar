 A more satisfying response would address why the jet stream was displaced northward,'' the team wrote.
 By July the weather pattern they studied was breaking up, and continuing dryness in the study area and elsewhere probably had other causes, Arkin said.
 In this period, Pacific Ocean temperatures ranged up to 5.4 degrees Fahrenheit below normal in a narrow band extending about 4,000 miles along the equator westward from the coast of South America, with the coolest spot midway along the band.
 At the same time, a bit to the north of this band, surface temperatures ranged up to 0.9 degrees above normal.
 When this temperature pattern was fed into the computer, the pattern of stationary alternating high and low pressure systems was reproduced.
