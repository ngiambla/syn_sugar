 But during the April-June period there were alternating high and low pressure centers across much of the northern half of the Western Hemisphere: A high-pressure center north of Hawaii, a low in the Gulf of Alaska, a high in central Canada extending down into the northern Great Plains states and a low on the East Coast.
 In this period, Pacific Ocean temperatures ranged up to 5.4 degrees Fahrenheit below normal in a narrow band extending about 4,000 miles along the equator westward from the coast of South America, with the coolest spot midway along the band.
 When this temperature pattern was fed into the computer, the pattern of stationary alternating high and low pressure systems was reproduced.
 The below-normal equatorial temperature by itself did not give such a result. ``We haven't proved anything; all we've done is shown that it's a possibility,'' Arkin said.
 The global atmosphere is so complicated that repeated running of a more detailed computer model would be needed to show that these abnormal temperatures are likely to be associated with drought, he said.
