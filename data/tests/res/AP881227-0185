 The most striking development of the last 18 months has been the Shining Path's move into public view in this grimy capital on South America's Pacific coast.
 Red-painted slogans hailing the ``People's War'' and ``President Gonzalo,'' the rebel name for Guzman, cover the concrete-block clinic, other buildings with solid walls and even large rocks.
 Residents were suspicious and uncommunicative when an Associated Press reporter visited, except for three 10-year-old boys at the entrance who laughed and waved red flags with the Shining Path's hammer-and-sickle emblem.
