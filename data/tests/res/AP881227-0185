 Shining Path guerrillas, who started their bloody uprising in the mountains eight years ago, are moving into the shantytowns that encircle the capital like a noose.
 Their huts built of straw mats line the bone-dry slopes of the Andean foothills 15 miles east of downtown Lima.
 They make ideal recruits for the Shining Path _ Sendero Luminoso in Spanish.
 Shining Path's move into a more public role, and through most of Peru from its Andean base in Ayacucho province, has coincided with economic collapse and annual inflation of nearly 2,000 percent.
 More than 12,000 people have been killed in the civil war, most of them Andean peasants slain by rebels or security forces, and official figures put damage to the shattered economy at $10 billion.
