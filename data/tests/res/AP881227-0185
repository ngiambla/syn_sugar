 Shining Path's move into a more public role, and through most of Peru from its Andean base in Ayacucho province, has coincided with economic collapse and annual inflation of nearly 2,000 percent.
 The guerrillas also work with drug traffickers in Peru's eastern jungle, source of the raw material for much of the world's cocaine, and buy sophisticated weapons with the profits.
 More than 12,000 people have been killed in the civil war, most of them Andean peasants slain by rebels or security forces, and official figures put damage to the shattered economy at $10 billion.
 The guerrillas are believed to have only about 5,000 armed combatants, so they do not appear close to seizing power, but there is increasing pessimism about the prospects of controlling them. ``Most evaluations of Sendero Luminoso's eight-year expansion under the democratic system ... have become increasingly grim,'' the Andean Report, a respected economic journal, said recently.
 One reason the movement grows is its appeal to Peru's Indians, subjected for centuries to scorn and discrimination by the white ruling elite. ``Political violence in Peru is not the result of poverty alone but of humiliation, oppression, hate between classes, racism,'' Sen.
 The most striking development of the last 18 months has been the Shining Path's move into public view in this grimy capital on South America's Pacific coast.
 Guzman, a Marxist philosophy professor, founded Sendero Luminoso in 1970 in Ayacucho, an Andean state capital 230 miles southeast of Lima where he had built a following at the University of Huamanga.
 Shining Path has infiltrated 167 unions and neighborhood associations in the Lima slums this year, says a confidential Interior Ministry report obtained by The Associated Press.
 Residents were suspicious and uncommunicative when an Associated Press reporter visited, except for three 10-year-old boys at the entrance who laughed and waved red flags with the Shining Path's hammer-and-sickle emblem.
 The highway ties Lima to the agricultural lands of the central Andes and Peru's most important mines, where unions threatened by the Shining Path have conducted a strike since late October that costs millions of dollars a day in export earnings.
