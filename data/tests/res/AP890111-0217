 The government also ordered immediate checks of engine monitoring systems on similar aircraft to verify that they correctly indicate right and left, prompting speculation that a malfunctioning alarm system could have misled the flight crew.
 U.S. media reported that the crew of the jet shut down the wrong engine, and Britain's tabloid newspapers drew similar conclusions in banner headlines. ``Error on the Flight Deck,'' the Today newspaper said. ``Fatal Error'' said the Daily Star. ``Pilot Shut Off the Wrong Engine'' said the Sun.
 The Transport Department said that ``evidence obtained early in the investigation'' indicated both of the plane's engines ``might have suffered a related failure'' and that possibility was still being examined.
 The statement from the department's Air Accidents Investigation Branch also confirmed that the airplane's left engine caught fire and the right engine was shut down, and that pilot Kevin Hunt had told ground control the fire was in the right engine.
 The jet, en route from London to Belfast with 126 people aboard, plunged into an embankment a half-mile short of the runway at East Midlands Airport in central England as it was trying to make an emergency landing Sunday night.
 In the United States, NBC News quoted unidentified U.S. government sources as saying ``the plane's flight recorders, which monitor engine performance and the pilots' conversations, indicate the crew shut down the wrong engine.
 The Washington Post, quoting unidentified accident investigators, said the crew believed they were making a routine, one-engine emergency landing, and apparently thought they had solved the problem when they shut down an engine.
 Government sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Hunt reported at 8:06 p.m. that ``I have an engine on fire.'' Then, at 8:14 p.m., the sources said he told traffic control: ``I am shutting down the starboard (right) engine.'' The plane crashed 12 minutes later at 8:26 p.m.
 The Civil Aviation Authority said that on the advice of investigators, it was issuing new instructions for the inspection and monitoring of Boeing 737-300, Boeing 737-400 and Airbus A320 airplanes, all of which use the CFM56 engine.
 Boeing Commercial Airplanes spokesman Craig Martin said in Seattle of the FAA's inspection order, ``We certainly believe it's a prudent measure to go out and check to make sure there's nothing wrong with the fleet.
