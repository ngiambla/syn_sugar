 In the United States, NBC News quoted unidentified U.S. government sources as saying ``the plane's flight recorders, which monitor engine performance and the pilots' conversations, indicate the crew shut down the wrong engine.
 The Washington Post, quoting unidentified accident investigators, said the crew believed they were making a routine, one-engine emergency landing, and apparently thought they had solved the problem when they shut down an engine.
 The timer valve made by GE for the CFM56 engine could not have caused the turbine to fail even if the valve malfunctioned, Kennedy said.
