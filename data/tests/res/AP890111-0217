 The government also ordered immediate checks of engine monitoring systems on similar aircraft to verify that they correctly indicate right and left, prompting speculation that a malfunctioning alarm system could have misled the flight crew.
 U.S. media reported that the crew of the jet shut down the wrong engine, and Britain's tabloid newspapers drew similar conclusions in banner headlines. ``Error on the Flight Deck,'' the Today newspaper said. ``Fatal Error'' said the Daily Star. ``Pilot Shut Off the Wrong Engine'' said the Sun.
 The statement from the department's Air Accidents Investigation Branch also confirmed that the airplane's left engine caught fire and the right engine was shut down, and that pilot Kevin Hunt had told ground control the fire was in the right engine.
 The reasons for shutting down the engine ``are not yet clear and are still under investigation,'' it said.
