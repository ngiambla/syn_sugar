(AP) </DATELINE> <TEXT> The new year ushers in a new wildfire season, an unwelcome thought to the residents of this small Montana tourist town on the northeastern corner of Yellowstone National Park.
 For two months last summer the citizens of Cooke City and its tiny suburb, Silver Gate, were showcased on the nightly TV news and splashed across the front pages of the nation's newspapers as forest fires threatened to burn them out.
 Pinched between the Storm Creek and Clover-Mist blazes, an estimated 150 seasonal residents and dozens of tourists were evacuated twice while hundreds of firefighters faced down walls of flame which threatened annihilation.
 One wag even changed the sign leading into town by adding a single letter, rechristening it ``Cooked City.'' Their economically critical summer tourist season a bust and the hunting season crippled, the folks of Silver Gate and Cooke City straggled home in mid-September to pick up the pieces. ``The first thing most people around here did was go on vacation,'' said Patti Smith, owner with her husband, Bob, of the Bearclaw Service and Cabins, a gas station and small motel. ``The fire really took a toll on a lot of folks. ``Business was way down this fall because we didn't have the hunters, but we got a lot of curious weekenders from Cody and Billings who wanted to see how bad it was.'' The Smiths, who own the only photocopy machine for 30 miles in every direction, found their small gas station and convenience store a mecca during the fires.
 The second time the sirens went off and we had to leave, my parents had just arrived from North Platte, Neb., so we all went to Red Lodge (Mont.), got nice motel rooms, and crashed.'' Winter now cloaks Cooke City and Silver Gate, and only about 70 year-round residents remain to weather the below-zero months.
