 For two months last summer the citizens of Cooke City and its tiny suburb, Silver Gate, were showcased on the nightly TV news and splashed across the front pages of the nation's newspapers as forest fires threatened to burn them out.
 Pinched between the Storm Creek and Clover-Mist blazes, an estimated 150 seasonal residents and dozens of tourists were evacuated twice while hundreds of firefighters faced down walls of flame which threatened annihilation.
 One wag even changed the sign leading into town by adding a single letter, rechristening it ``Cooked City.'' Their economically critical summer tourist season a bust and the hunting season crippled, the folks of Silver Gate and Cooke City straggled home in mid-September to pick up the pieces. ``The first thing most people around here did was go on vacation,'' said Patti Smith, owner with her husband, Bob, of the Bearclaw Service and Cabins, a gas station and small motel. ``The fire really took a toll on a lot of folks. ``Business was way down this fall because we didn't have the hunters, but we got a lot of curious weekenders from Cody and Billings who wanted to see how bad it was.'' The Smiths, who own the only photocopy machine for 30 miles in every direction, found their small gas station and convenience store a mecca during the fires.
 Forest Service, which coordinated some of its firefighting efforts from Cooke City, set up shop near the photocopy machine, and everybody who had information or was seeking some crammed into the Smiths' log cabin office. ``It was crazy for a while,'' said Mrs.
 The second time the sirens went off and we had to leave, my parents had just arrived from North Platte, Neb., so we all went to Red Lodge (Mont.), got nice motel rooms, and crashed.'' Winter now cloaks Cooke City and Silver Gate, and only about 70 year-round residents remain to weather the below-zero months.
 The only grocery store is on its winter schedule, open just Friday through Monday, and many curio shops are shut up tight, but the Bearclaw cabins and most of the other motels are open for winter sports enthusiasts.
 Smith. ``No smoke, no flames, and plenty of tourists.'' It's snowmobiling season now, and clubs from as far away as Canada and Illinois are booked into Cooke City's motels to take advantage of the beautiful scenery and 80 miles of trails in the area.
 Smith also has a new project. ``I'm going to do my scrapbooks,'' she said, hauling out from underneath a counter a huge cardboard box overflowing with newspaper clippings and official fire bulletins, among them a firefighters' newsletter, ``The Griz Gazette,'' purporting to have spotted Elvis Presley on the fire line. ``I've got the whole story right here in this box,'' said the amateur historian. ``Of course, a lot of it is wrong.'' Like nearly everybody else in Cooke City and Silver Gate, Mrs.
 Smith and her friends and neighbors worry about what's happening underneath the blanket of snow this winter. ``Are there still smoldering embers out there deep in the roots of the trees?'' wondered Mrs.
 In his 18 years of studying wildfires, Norum has come across several incidents where wildfires buried themselves in the roots of trees and grasses and smoldered all winter only to pop up through the snow in the spring.
