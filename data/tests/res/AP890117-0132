 The City Council today asked county prosecutors to investigate the conduct of a white policeman who was secretly filmed while he pushed an off-duty black policeman through a plate-glass window. ``We're certainly not happy to have an incident like this occurring, but we need all the information,'' said Councilman Thomas J.
 Curt Livesay, an assisant Los Angeles County district attorney and head of the office's Special Investigations Division, will lead the probe, said district attorney spokesman Andy Reynolds.
 The black Hawthorne policeman, Sgt.
 Don Jackson, said he set up the self-styled ``sting'' in Long Beach to expose alleged police racism in the Los Angeles area.
 City officials promised a thorough inquiry. ``We will pursue it aggressively,'' said Long Beach City Manager James Hanklad. ``If there is evidence of brutality, we will act accordingly.'' Long Beach Mayor Ernie Kell said on NBC's ``Today'' show this morning that he was disturbed by the videotape. ``I ... do not support racism or police brutality, nor do the vast majority of the citizens of Long Beach, and we're a caring, thinking community and it disturbed us very much to see the tape,'' he said.
