 The Office of Fair Trading said Tuesday it was investigating a complaint alleging anti-competitive practices by a London-based diamond cartel controlled by South Africa's giant De Beers diamond organization.
 Consolidated Gold Fields PLC, a British mining concern with no diamond interests, acknowledged that it filed the complaint as a defensive move against a stalled takeover bid by Luxembourg-based Minorco SA.
 Minorco is 60.1 percent owned by Anglo American Corp. of South Africa Ltd. and De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd., the gold and diamond mining interests controlled by the Oppenheimer family of South Africa.
 The British government is expected to rule in the next few weeks whether to allow Minorco to proceed with its 2.9 billion-pound (about $5.1 billion) bid for Consolidated Gold following an investigation by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
 As well as selling the stones mined by De Beers and other South African companies, the organization trades on behalf of diamond producers including Zaire, Australia, Botswana and the Soviet Union.
 The Office of Fair Trading said it would first have to establish whether it had jurisdiction over the Central Selling Organization because although it is based in London, De Beers is a South African company.
