 The watchdog body said De Beers ``appeared to have'' a monopoly on diamond trading in London and it was interested in establishing whether there had been an abuse of the monopoly.
 Minorco is 60.1 percent owned by Anglo American Corp. of South Africa Ltd. and De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd., the gold and diamond mining interests controlled by the Oppenheimer family of South Africa.
