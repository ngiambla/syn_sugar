 Consolidated Gold Fields PLC, a British mining concern with no diamond interests, acknowledged that it filed the complaint as a defensive move against a stalled takeover bid by Luxembourg-based Minorco SA.
 Minorco is 60.1 percent owned by Anglo American Corp. of South Africa Ltd. and De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd., the gold and diamond mining interests controlled by the Oppenheimer family of South Africa.
 As well as selling the stones mined by De Beers and other South African companies, the organization trades on behalf of diamond producers including Zaire, Australia, Botswana and the Soviet Union.
 The Office of Fair Trading said it would first have to establish whether it had jurisdiction over the Central Selling Organization because although it is based in London, De Beers is a South African company.
 A spokesman for the Central Selling Organization said the Office of Fair Trading notified the organization about the inquiry but hadn't yet requested any information. ``It's still early'' in the investigation, said the spokesman, commenting on condition he was not identified.
