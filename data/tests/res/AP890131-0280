 The Office of Fair Trading said Tuesday it was investigating a complaint alleging anti-competitive practices by a London-based diamond cartel controlled by South Africa's giant De Beers diamond organization.
 Consolidated Gold Fields PLC, a British mining concern with no diamond interests, acknowledged that it filed the complaint as a defensive move against a stalled takeover bid by Luxembourg-based Minorco SA.
 Minorco is 60.1 percent owned by Anglo American Corp. of South Africa Ltd. and De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd., the gold and diamond mining interests controlled by the Oppenheimer family of South Africa.
 A Consolidated Gold spokesman, commenting on condition he was not identified, said the company wanted to point up the ``monopolistic tendencies'' of South Africa's Anglo-American group of companies.
 The Office of Fair Trading said it would first have to establish whether it had jurisdiction over the Central Selling Organization because although it is based in London, De Beers is a South African company.
