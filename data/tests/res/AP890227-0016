 One of nature's most vicious spectacles, the tornado, is poised to renew its annual assault on America, as changeable spring weather breeds the storms that spawn twisters.
 Last year was one of fewer than normal tornado deaths, but even so, more than 700 of the violent funnel clouds struck the nation.
 In 1988 the nation recorded 32 tornado deaths, down from the 59 killed a year earlier and well below the long-term average of 99 fatalities annually, the National Weather Service reported on Sunday.
 Meteorologists have attributed the decline in tornado deaths in recent years to increased public awareness of the storms, which are most common in May and June but can occur in any month of the year.
 The transition from winter to spring, spurring unsettled weather and frequent thunderstorms, helps create tornadoes, violently twisting winds that reach down from thunderclouds.
 Hot weather stirring the air helps form thunderstorms and their tornadoes, with 60 percent of all twisters occurring between noon and sunset, according to the National Center for Atmospheric Research.
 The typical tornado is only about 50 yards wide and travels about two miles on the ground _ 87 percent of the time heading toward the northeast, NCAR researchers report.
 But while an individual twister can cover only a small area, they often come in groups and in the affected area destruction can be total.
 Stay away from windows and outside walls. _At school, move to hallways and lie flat on the floor with head covered. _In a mobile home or trailer, leave immediately.
 Be wary of areas with poor drainage, however, because of the possibility of flooding from the thunderstorm. _At work or in public buildings, head for interior hallways on the lowest floor, or designated shelter areas. _In an automobile, leave immediately.
