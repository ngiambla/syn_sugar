 SCHMID</BYLINE> <BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE> <DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE> <TEXT> One of nature's most vicious spectacles, the tornado, is poised to renew its annual assault on America, as changeable spring weather breeds the storms that spawn twisters.
 Last year was one of fewer than normal tornado deaths, but even so, more than 700 of the violent funnel clouds struck the nation.
 In 1988 the nation recorded 32 tornado deaths, down from the 59 killed a year earlier and well below the long-term average of 99 fatalities annually, the National Weather Service reported on Sunday.
 Meteorologists have attributed the decline in tornado deaths in recent years to increased public awareness of the storms, which are most common in May and June but can occur in any month of the year.
 Unusually warm and wet weather last November helped trigger a record number of tornadoes for that month, at 121 across the country.
