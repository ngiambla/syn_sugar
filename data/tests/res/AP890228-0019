 SCHMID</BYLINE> <BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE> <DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE> <TEXT> The earthquake that killed 25,000 people in Armenia pushed last year's earthquake-related death toll worldwide to the highest level since 1976, when a Chinese earthquake killed at least 10 times as many, the U.S.
 The estimated earthquake death toll in 1988 includes an additional 2,000 or more people who died in other earthquakes around the world, the Survey reported Monday.
 In addition to the deaths, some 13,000 people were injured and more than a half-million were left homeless in the Armenian earthquake, which had a magnitude of 6.8 on the Richter scale.
 The main shock was followed within minutes by a second, measuring 5.8 on the Richter scale, which estimates the energy released by an earthquake.
 An earthquake of 5.0 can cause considerable damage, and the strength rises by 10 times for each whole number on the scale.
 On Nov. 6 an earthquake measuring 7.3 on the scale claimed 730 lives and injured about 4,000 people on the border between Burma and China, the Geological Survey reported.
