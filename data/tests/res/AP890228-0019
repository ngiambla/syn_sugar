 The earthquake that killed 25,000 people in Armenia pushed last year's earthquake-related death toll worldwide to the highest level since 1976, when a Chinese earthquake killed at least 10 times as many, the U.S.
 The estimated earthquake death toll in 1988 includes an additional 2,000 or more people who died in other earthquakes around the world, the Survey reported Monday.
 The main shock was followed within minutes by a second, measuring 5.8 on the Richter scale, which estimates the energy released by an earthquake.
 An earthquake of 5.0 can cause considerable damage, and the strength rises by 10 times for each whole number on the scale.
 Many of the deaths in Armenia were blamed on collapsing buildings, as the earthquake rattled concrete structures until they fell to the ground, according to subsequent analyses.
 On Nov. 6 an earthquake measuring 7.3 on the scale claimed 730 lives and injured about 4,000 people on the border between Burma and China, the Geological Survey reported.
 That earthquake, measured at 7.6, occurred March 6 in the Gulf of Alaska and resulted in only minor damage.
 The only U.S. earthquake death last year occured when someone suffered a heart attack after an earthquake measuring 4.8 in Whittier, Calif., in February.
 An earthquake centered in eastern Canada on Nov. 25 was felt widely across that country and in the northeastern United States as far south as Washington, the Survey reported.
 Injuries were also reported from two offshore earthquakes, one in the Ionian Sea near Greece Oct. 16 and another near the Azores Islands Nov. 21.
