 The earthquake that killed 25,000 people in Armenia pushed last year's earthquake-related death toll worldwide to the highest level since 1976, when a Chinese earthquake killed at least 10 times as many, the U.S.
 That earthquake, measured at 7.6, occurred March 6 in the Gulf of Alaska and resulted in only minor damage.
