 The earthquake that killed 25,000 people in Armenia pushed last year's earthquake-related death toll worldwide to the highest level since 1976, when a Chinese earthquake killed at least 10 times as many, the U.S.
 An earthquake of 5.0 can cause considerable damage, and the strength rises by 10 times for each whole number on the scale.
 Many of the deaths in Armenia were blamed on collapsing buildings, as the earthquake rattled concrete structures until they fell to the ground, according to subsequent analyses.
 On Nov. 6 an earthquake measuring 7.3 on the scale claimed 730 lives and injured about 4,000 people on the border between Burma and China, the Geological Survey reported.
 That earthquake, measured at 7.6, occurred March 6 in the Gulf of Alaska and resulted in only minor damage.
