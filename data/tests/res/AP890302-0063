 Drug abusers who are infected with the AIDS virus and tuberculosis bacteria should be treated with medicine to prevent full-blown TB, says a study published today.
 In the study published in the New England Journal of Medicine, the TB usually resulted from activation of lingering tuberculosis infections, not new exposures to the bacteria, in people who also are infected with the AIDS virus.
 The doctors warned that besides being at risk of getting tuberculosis themselves, AIDS-infected addicts who carry the TB bacteria also may pass the germs to people they live with, to health care workers and other people. ``The aggressive identification and treatment of HIV-infected intravenous drug users with latent tuberculous infection is therefore of both clinical and public health importance,'' wrote Dr.
 While most people with the AIDS virus eventually go on to get acquired immune deficiency syndrome, people who carry the tuberculosis bacteria ordinarily have only about a 10 percent life-long risk of getting TB.
 Twenty-three percent of those with HIV also carried TB bacteria as did 20 percent of those who were free of the AIDS virus.
 During almost two years of followup, active tuberculosis developed in eight of the AIDS-infected people, but in none of those who did not have HIV.
 The doctors noted that 13 people who carried HIV and TB bacteria were treated with the drug isoniazid, and none of them went on to get active tuberculosis.
