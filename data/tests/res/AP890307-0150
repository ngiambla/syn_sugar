 Solar telescopes yielded views of flare-producing sunspots and silhouetted mountains on the moon Tuesday as crowds gathered to watch a partial solar eclipse visible across western North America. ``There was a childlike delight with the wonder of nature,'' said Ed Krupp, director of Griffith Observatory in Los Angeles, where 600 children and at least 400 other people watched the moon block out 37 percent of the sun's surface at 10:50 a.m.
 PST. ``It was certainly a lively crowd,'' he said. ``There was a festival atmosphere.'' ``It's kind of neat,'' said map maker Jan Mayne, who was among dozens of people watching the eclipse through two types of solar telescopes at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena.
 As the moon passed between the Earth and sun to cause the partial eclipse, those watching through Caltech's telescopes could see mountains on the edge of the moon silhouetted against the sun.
 The eclipse was visible to at least some extent west of a diagonal line stretching roughly from Mazatlan, Mexico, northeast to Dallas and Chicago.
 But because the eclipse was partial most people didn't notice the slight dimming of sunlight. ``You can't tell the difference between a partial eclipse and a second-stage smog alert,'' joked one observer at Caltech.
 Several people viewed the eclipse through welder's helmets in downtown Anchorage, Alaska, where the moon obscured 80 percent of the sun at 9:13 a.m.
 Fearful that people would suffer eye damage during the eclipse, scientists warned against staring at the sun directly or through inadequate filters, including smoked glass and photographic film or filters.
