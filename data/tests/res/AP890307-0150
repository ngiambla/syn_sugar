 Several people viewed the eclipse through welder's helmets in downtown Anchorage, Alaska, where the moon obscured 80 percent of the sun at 9:13 a.m.
 In San Francisco, the moon eclipsed 46 percent of the sun at 9:52 a.m., but the event wasn't visible because of clouds that were so thick they delayed arriving flights at the airport.
 Alan MacRobert, spokesman for Sky &amp; Telescope magazine, said there were 245 known eye injuries in the United States after an eclipse in 1970, but warnings about the danger reduced the number to three during a 1984 partial eclipse.
