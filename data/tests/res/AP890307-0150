(AP) Solar telescopes yielded views of flare-producing sunspots and silhouetted mountains on the moon Tuesday as crowds gathered to watch a partial solar eclipse visible across western North America. ``There was a childlike delight with the wonder of nature,'' said Ed Krupp, director of Griffith Observatory in Los Angeles, where 600 children and at least 400 other people watched the moon block out 37 percent of the sun's surface at 10:50 a.m.
 PST. ``It was certainly a lively crowd,'' he said. ``There was a festival atmosphere.'' ``It's kind of neat,'' said map maker Jan Mayne, who was among dozens of people watching the eclipse through two types of solar telescopes at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena.
 As the moon passed between the Earth and sun to cause the partial eclipse, those watching through Caltech's telescopes could see mountains on the edge of the moon silhouetted against the sun.
 Also visible were gas jets on the sun's surface and a giant group of sunspots that on Monday produced the most intense solar flare _ a burst of heat and radiation _ since 1984. ``There was a stunning view of that large sunspot group,'' Krupp said.
 But because the eclipse was partial most people didn't notice the slight dimming of sunlight. ``You can't tell the difference between a partial eclipse and a second-stage smog alert,'' joked one observer at Caltech.
