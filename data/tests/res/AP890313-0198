 A genetic marker might identify people who are susceptible, which could lead to a screening test, he said. ``Then you could go out and zero in on the genetic susceptibles and you can be more intense on your recommendations to them and you could also study that group.'' Stern believes if people exercised more and ate less of the fat-saturated foods common to the diets of low-income Hispanics, fewer would get the disease. ``We use the term double jeopardy for Mexican-Americans,'' he said. ``We don't know why, when they get diabetes, they have a more severe form of the disease _ whether it's a biological difference or is it that they are not getting as good medical care. ``But the interesting thing is that upper-income Mexican-Americans do not have the same risk as low-income Mexican-Americans.
 It may be that the gene is there, but for some reason it may not be expressed in the upper-income Mexican-Americans. ``Also, Mexican-Americans tend to have more body fat in their upper torso and we can see that as related to diabetes.'' Between 1979 and 1988, Stern and his staff studied more than 5,000 people and found that 387 of 2,905 Hispanics had the disease, or 13.3 percent, compared to only 87 of 1,780 Anglos, or 4.8 percent.
