 Educating elementary-school-age children about healthy diets would help reduce the number of diabetes cases, DeFronzo said. ``If you have a 65-year-old mother who weighs 220 pounds and you tell her to go out and jog five miles Monday, Wednesday and Friday, she is going to laugh at you.'' Aly El-Shiekh envisions astronauts on a three-year trip to Mars ``knitting'' themselves a space station using ceramic fibers that can be braided into panels, beams, boxes and practically any other shape. ``We believe if they can take the ceramic fibers they need and the machinery we're developing they would be able to literally make the space stations they will need as they go,'' said El-Shiekh, a mechanical engineer at working in North Carolina State University's textiles school.
 Peter Moyer is called to a car accident victim who has only slight injuries but slips so deeply into unconsciousness he can barely be roused by two physicians. ``Have you taken any drugs?'' doctors ask. ``Cocaine, heroin, marijuana?'' It's a question that has become more and more commonplace in emergency rooms already burdened by increased patient loads. ``There is an emergency in the emergency room right now in not only New York and Boston but around the country and for a variety of reasons,'' said Ken Raske, president of the Greater New York Hospital Association.
 From 1986 to 1987, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, cocaine-related cases in emergency rooms increased 122 percent in the District of Columbia; 86 percent in both Boston and Atlanta; 80 percent in Detroit; 73 percent in Chicago; 53 percent in Minneapolis; 50 percent in Texas, and 39 percent in New York City.
