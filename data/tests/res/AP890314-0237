 Educating elementary-school-age children about healthy diets would help reduce the number of diabetes cases, DeFronzo said. ``If you have a 65-year-old mother who weighs 220 pounds and you tell her to go out and jog five miles Monday, Wednesday and Friday, she is going to laugh at you.'' Researcher Developing Machinery To Braid Ceramic Fibers RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) Aly El-Shiekh envisions astronauts on a three-year trip to Mars ``knitting'' themselves a space station using ceramic fibers that can be braided into panels, beams, boxes and practically any other shape. ``We believe if they can take the ceramic fibers they need and the machinery we're developing they would be able to literally make the space stations they will need as they go,'' said El-Shiekh, a mechanical engineer at working in North Carolina State University's textiles school.
 While much of his work relates to the Mars Mission Research Center here, El-Shiekh sees a big future for composite materials like ceramic fibers. ``The day may very well come when you are driving around with car engine parts of ceramic fiber,'' he said, adding that the vibration-damping properties of the materials also would make them good for torsion bars in cars. ``We also are working on the idea of putting this braided fabric in concrete as reinforcing material instead of metal rods,'' he said. ``It is stronger than steel, does not rust and would not wear away _ the road would not deteriorate.'' The fibers, including Kevlar now used to make bulletproof vests, also could be used to make some body parts, and El-Shiekh is working with Duke University researchers on ceramic ``stents,'' collapsible braces for arteries. ``The possibilities are limitless.'' said El-Shiekh, who can produce shapes ranging from hollow cubes to panels that have openings for wiring and conduits already braided into them. ``The big problem is cost and that's why we're working on this automated machinery.''
