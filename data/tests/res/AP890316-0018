 Scientists missed by 150 years in dating the oldest known reliable record of a total solar eclipse, a clay tablet that also reflects fear among the ancient observers, researchers said today.
 But in today's issue of the British journal Nature, two Dutch scientists report their analysis shows the eclipse really happened about 150 years later, on March 5, 1223 B.C.
 One side appears to tell of a solar eclipse, and the reverse side reads, ``Two livers were examined: danger.'' ``Apparently the anxiety caused by the eclipse of the Sun and the sudden appearance of Mars had to be resolved by an explanation through liver divination,'' wrote the researchers from the University of Amsterdam and Leiden University.
 Walker of the British Museum in London cautioned that their conclusion ``can best be regarded as a plausible hypothesis.'' The translation of the tablet's text is not certain, and the study assumes that citizens of Ugarit followed an Egyptian-style calendar, for which no supporting evidence is available, he said.
 Even if the tablet is 150 years younger than previously believed, it would remain the oldest known reliable record of a total solar eclipse, Edwin Krupp, director of the Griffith Observatory in Los Angeles, said in a telephone interview.
