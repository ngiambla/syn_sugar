 The city's police chief, John Laux, says there is no reason to assume the department would be immune to a problem that is present in all segments of society. ``The whole society to different degrees has problems of racism,'' he said.
 Everyone always says, `I can't believe this is happening in Minnesota, in Minneapolis, the home of progressiveness.' That is real tricky,'' Hayden said. ``If we get preoccupied with the image of the city, we're not going to be able to thoroughly address the problems we're facing.'' ``The liberal image is a false picture,'' said Chris Nisan, a University of Minnesota student who has been involved in recent protests.
 City Council voted last week to study the problem. ``There are bad apples in every bunch and the Minneapolis Police Department is no exception,'' said Councilwoman Sayles Belton. ``I don't think they (the good officers) are pleased with the few that are giving them the bad rap _ the spoilers.'' Lloyd Smalley, 71, and Lillian Weiss, 65, were killed Jan. 25 in a fire that started after police hurled a stun grenade into their apartment, where others also lived, during a drug raid.
 Gleason Glover, president of the Minneapolis Urban League, which works for interracial cooperation, said police racism has been a problem since he took over the league position 21 years ago. ``The matter of police misconduct and brutality has been going on for at least the 21 years I've been here, but I think the deaths pushed the issue beyond the point of tolerance that usually is the case in matters of police misconduct,'' Glover said. ``There is deep resentment in both the black community and among police officers with regard to how they feel they are perceived by each other ...
 Laux opposes establisment of a citizen panel to look into police actions. ``The key point is that any time the head of the police department cannot hire, fire or impose discipline, you are no longer in charge,'' he said.
