 Allegations of police racism and brutality have shaken this city that for decades has prided itself on a progressive attitude toward civil rights and a reputation for racial harmony.
 The deaths of two blacks at a drug raid that went awry, followed 10 days later by a scuffle between police and blacks at a downtown hotel, touched off an outcry by minority leaders for an outside review of the department. ``It's like a watch spring.
 I think we're approaching that breaking point,'' said Van Hayden, 25, a student who says police beat him at the hotel.
 The city's police chief, John Laux, says there is no reason to assume the department would be immune to a problem that is present in all segments of society. ``The whole society to different degrees has problems of racism,'' he said.
 Everyone always says, `I can't believe this is happening in Minnesota, in Minneapolis, the home of progressiveness.' That is real tricky,'' Hayden said. ``If we get preoccupied with the image of the city, we're not going to be able to thoroughly address the problems we're facing.'' ``The liberal image is a false picture,'' said Chris Nisan, a University of Minnesota student who has been involved in recent protests.
