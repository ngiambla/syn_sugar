 The deaths of two blacks at a drug raid that went awry, followed 10 days later by a scuffle between police and blacks at a downtown hotel, touched off an outcry by minority leaders for an outside review of the department. ``It's like a watch spring.
 I think we're approaching that breaking point,'' said Van Hayden, 25, a student who says police beat him at the hotel.
 The city's police chief, John Laux, says there is no reason to assume the department would be immune to a problem that is present in all segments of society. ``The whole society to different degrees has problems of racism,'' he said.
