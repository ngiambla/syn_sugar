 Allegations of police racism and brutality have shaken this city that for decades has prided itself on a progressive attitude toward civil rights and a reputation for racial harmony.
 The city's police chief, John Laux, says there is no reason to assume the department would be immune to a problem that is present in all segments of society. ``The whole society to different degrees has problems of racism,'' he said.
 Senate, electrified the 1948 Democratic National Convention with his historic speech in support of civil rights, Minneapolis has been viewed as a liberal, progressive city.
 City Council voted last week to study the problem. ``There are bad apples in every bunch and the Minneapolis Police Department is no exception,'' said Councilwoman Sayles Belton. ``I don't think they (the good officers) are pleased with the few that are giving them the bad rap _ the spoilers.'' Lloyd Smalley, 71, and Lillian Weiss, 65, were killed Jan. 25 in a fire that started after police hurled a stun grenade into their apartment, where others also lived, during a drug raid.
 Laux opposes establisment of a citizen panel to look into police actions. ``The key point is that any time the head of the police department cannot hire, fire or impose discipline, you are no longer in charge,'' he said.
