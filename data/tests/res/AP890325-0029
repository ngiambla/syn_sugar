 Coast Guard spokesman Ed Wieliczkiewicz said the use of chemicals to disperse and sink the heavy North Slope crude oil failed because the agents depend in part on rough seas to break up the oil.
 Early Friday the Exxon Valdez was losing 20,000 gallons of oil per hour, but the flow slowed to a trickle later.
 Lawn likened the ship's situation to ``trying to park a Cadillac in a Volkswagen spot.'' Divers were to check the ship's hull and their findings were to be used in making plans for the removal of crude oil still aboard the vessel. ``A spill of this size in such a complex environment promises to be a cleanup nightmare,'' said Golob, a Cambridge, Mass.-based consultant whose firm has studied oil spills and environmental disasters for 15 years.
