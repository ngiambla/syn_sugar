 The spill of some 270,000 barrels _ or 11.3 million gallons _ occurred early Friday when the 987-foot tanker Exxon Valdez went hard aground on Bligh Reef, about 25 miles outside Valdez, the northermost ice-free port in the United States.
 Coast Guard spokesman Ed Wieliczkiewicz said the use of chemicals to disperse and sink the heavy North Slope crude oil failed because the agents depend in part on rough seas to break up the oil.
 He said Exxon officials plan to pump the oil remaining aboard the Exxon Valdez onto the Exxon Baton Rouge, another tanker.
 Early Friday the Exxon Valdez was losing 20,000 gallons of oil per hour, but the flow slowed to a trickle later.
 The Exxon Valdez had loaded 1.2 million barrels of oil at the Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. marine terminal at Valdez and was en route to Long Beach, Calif., when it crunched onto the reef.
