 The tanker that caused the nation's biggest oil spill was being illegally piloted by its third mate when the vessel ran aground on a reef, Exxon Shipping Co. said Sunday.
 Department of Interior spokeswoman Pamela Bergmann said a wildlife specialist sailed in the sound Saturday and observed 75 ducks and two otters coated with oil.
 Both companies said they were satisfied with the handling of the problem. ``We're proceeding cautiously,'' said Exxon spokesman Tom Cirigliano. ``We want to make sure we don't make any mistakes in cleaning up the spill.'' Exxon Shipping Co.
 The spill came at a time when Prince William Sound fishermen were preparing for the herring season, which is followed by harvests of shellfish and salmon.
 Fishermen said they have had two good years back to back, and some were spurred by that success to go into debt for new equipment this year.
