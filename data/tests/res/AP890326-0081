 The Coast Guard said it ordered the closure to prevent pollution from being carried to Valdez on vessels passing through the oil.
 They could not be captured for cleaning, she said.
 The Coast Guard estimated the area affected by the spill at 100 square miles.
 The Coast Guard said about 84,000 gallons of oil an hour was being transferred; at that rate, the unloading could take seven days.
 The spill came at a time when Prince William Sound fishermen were preparing for the herring season, which is followed by harvests of shellfish and salmon.
