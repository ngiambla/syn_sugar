 The tanker that caused the nation's biggest oil spill was being illegally piloted by its third mate when the vessel ran aground on a reef, Exxon Shipping Co. said Sunday.
 It's our policy he should have been there.'' An Exxon spokeswoman, Sharon Curran-Wescott, said she believed Cousin's actions violated federal regulations. ``He didn't have a proper pilot's license for that.
 Department of Interior spokeswoman Pamela Bergmann said a wildlife specialist sailed in the sound Saturday and observed 75 ducks and two otters coated with oil.
 We'll be requesting President Bush to make a similar declaration.'' The 987-foot tanker Exxon Valdez, carrying 1.2 million barrels of North Slope crude oil loaded at Valdez, ran onto a reef 25 miles from the port early Friday after swinging out of a traffic lane to avoid ice.
 However, Exxon insisted that the area was only 10 to 12 square miles, and Coast Guard officials said they were at a loss to explain the difference in estimates.
 By late Sunday, Exxon officials said a total of 37,500 barrels of oil had been transferred in the first two days of the operation, leaving more than 900,000 barrels on the ship.
 An experiment to assess the possibility of burning off the oil was completed early Sunday and the Coast Guard said Exxon officials were ``cautiously optimistic.'' Environmentalists, the governor and other top state officials have accused Exxon and Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. of responding too slowly to the spill.
 The spill came at a time when Prince William Sound fishermen were preparing for the herring season, which is followed by harvests of shellfish and salmon.
 The herring catch, which usually takes place in April, primarily is for the harvest of roe, a delicacy that brings up to $25 per pound in Japan. ``It's possible they could avoid the oil,'' Brown said. ``Fish are not stupid.
 Fishermen said they have had two good years back to back, and some were spurred by that success to go into debt for new equipment this year.
