 The tanker that caused the nation's biggest oil spill was being illegally piloted by its third mate when the vessel ran aground on a reef, Exxon Shipping Co. said Sunday.
 The Coast Guard said the slick and patches of oil separated from it were spread over an area of about 100 square miles.
 Exxon Shipping spokesman Brian Dunphy told The Associated Press that the captain of the tanker Exxon Valdez, Joseph Hazelwood, was not on the bridge at the time of the accident and that third mate Gregory Cousins was in command. ``It's Exxon's policy that in the waters that the ship was located in, the captain should have been on the bridge,'' Dunphy said. ``There's a problem there in that he was not there.
 It's our policy he should have been there.'' An Exxon spokeswoman, Sharon Curran-Wescott, said she believed Cousin's actions violated federal regulations. ``He didn't have a proper pilot's license for that.
 Steve Cowper declared Prince William Sound a disaster area, freeing state resources for cleanup and paving the way for a federal disaster declaration. ``This oil spill may well be the greatest disaster to hit Alaska since the Good Friday earthquake 25 years ago,'' Cowper said in a news release. ``It requires the most thorough response we can muster and this disaster declaration is an important part of that response.
