 Exxon crews Tuesday finished pumping the remaining crude oil out of the tanker Exxon Valdez in preparation for refloating and removing the source of the nation's worst-ever oil spill.
 The fugitive captain of the Exxon Valdez sent signals he was ready to surrender to face criminal charges of operating the vessel while drunk.
 Iarossi also said Exxon has changed its policy because of the spill and now requires crews to be aboard ship, where drinking is prohibited, four hours before sailing.
 Canadian authorities also asked Exxon for assurances there will be no damage to the British Columbia coast if the tanker is towed to Oregon, and the mayor of Valdez said the ship was not welcome back in the port where it took on the load of crude.
 But after Long Island law enforcement authorities waited a second day for Hazelwood to turn himself in, the Suffolk County district attorney's office announced there would be no surrender that day.
 Fishermen counting on the sound's $12 million annual herring industry were told Monday by the state that it will not allow a season this year.
