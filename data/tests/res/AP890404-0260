 Exxon crews Tuesday finished pumping the remaining crude oil out of the tanker Exxon Valdez in preparation for refloating and removing the source of the nation's worst-ever oil spill.
 Port officials there said they weren't sure if they'd allow that, even though the $12 million repair bill would provide about 200 jobs. ``We're not willing to trade in the environment for jobs,'' Portland port spokesman Darrel Buttice said Monday.
 Canadian authorities also asked Exxon for assurances there will be no damage to the British Columbia coast if the tanker is towed to Oregon, and the mayor of Valdez said the ship was not welcome back in the port where it took on the load of crude.
 The family of the fired Exxon Valdez captain, Joseph Hazelwood, said the skipper wants to surrender but is awaiting advice from his attorney, according to Lt.
 Fishermen counting on the sound's $12 million annual herring industry were told Monday by the state that it will not allow a season this year.
