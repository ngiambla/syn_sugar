 The fugitive captain of the Exxon Valdez sent signals he was ready to surrender to face criminal charges of operating the vessel while drunk.
 Meanwhile, Exxon said placing an oil-catching boom around the ship immediately after the grounding could have touched off a giant explosion of gases from the oil, although that was not the reason it took 11 hours to set the first containment line. ``The worst thing we could have done early on was try to boom the vessel.
 A boom wasn't placed around the vessel for 11 hours because it wasn't available in Valdez, Exxon officials have said.
 Iarossi also said Exxon has changed its policy because of the spill and now requires crews to be aboard ship, where drinking is prohibited, four hours before sailing.
