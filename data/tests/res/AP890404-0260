 On if boom set right away, tanker may be taken to Far East and crew policy changed; revises oil-water numbers from Exxon, includes Canadians concerned about moving tanker, captain's surrender not expected Tuesday.
 Exxon crews Tuesday finished pumping the remaining crude oil out of the tanker Exxon Valdez in preparation for refloating and removing the source of the nation's worst-ever oil spill.
 Meanwhile, Exxon said placing an oil-catching boom around the ship immediately after the grounding could have touched off a giant explosion of gases from the oil, although that was not the reason it took 11 hours to set the first containment line. ``The worst thing we could have done early on was try to boom the vessel.
 A boom wasn't placed around the vessel for 11 hours because it wasn't available in Valdez, Exxon officials have said.
