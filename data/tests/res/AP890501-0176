 Exxon officials Monday released a revised plan for cleansing 364 miles of Alaskan coastline fouled by the nation's largest oil spill, but said their proposal requires a suspension of local environmental laws.
 The plan makes no provisions for continuing the cleanup beyond mid-September, and notes that 191 miles of lightly oiled coastline may not be cleaned mechanically at all, but be allowed to be washed naturally by the environment. ``It is expected that this will be the case for all lightly oiled Gulf of Alaska sites,'' said the two-part, 60-page report. ``We are going to have to take a hard look at that,'' responded Bill Lamoreaux, the ranking state environmental official monitoring the cleanup.
 Meanwhile, tar and sludge from the Valdez spill fouled the beaches of Alaska's wild Katmai National Park, drenching hundreds of sea otters and birds and threatening the huge brown bears prowling the refuge.
