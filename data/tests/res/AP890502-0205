 Yost on Tuesday attacked Exxon's plan to clean up the Alaskan oil spill.
 Consumers, politicians and environmentalists expressed their anger in a one-day ``Boycott Exxon'' campaign.
 Yost, the top federal official tracking the environmental disaster, said Exxon's plan was poorly drafted and lacking in specifics.
 But he stopped short of rejecting it, saying he wanted to meet with Exxon and state officials.
 In Washington, consumer activist Ralph Nader said Exxon ``should not be allowed to forget'' the spill and that a boycott would send the oil giant a message.
 He and others blasted Exxon for failing to be prepared for the spill and not rapidly responding to the accident that fouled hundreds of miles of Alaska's coast.
 They also questioned subsequent increases in gas prices. ``We are beginning the war of words and actions against any oil company that doesn't understand its responsibility to protect the environment,'' Massachusetts state Sen.
