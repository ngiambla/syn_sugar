 Coast Guard Commandant Paul A.
 Yost on Tuesday attacked Exxon's plan to clean up the Alaskan oil spill.
 Consumers, politicians and environmentalists expressed their anger in a one-day ``Boycott Exxon'' campaign.
 Yost, the top federal official tracking the environmental disaster, said Exxon's plan was poorly drafted and lacking in specifics.
 But he stopped short of rejecting it, saying he wanted to meet with Exxon and state officials.
