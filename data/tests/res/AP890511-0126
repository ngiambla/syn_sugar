 The tuberculosis rate in U.S. prisons may be more than three times higher than on the outside, federal health officials said Thursday, urging testing, isolation and other measures to curb TB behind bars.
 Researchers with the Centers for Disease Control cited a survey in 29 states, where prisons reported 31 tuberculosis cases per 100,000 inmates in 1984-85, compared with eight cases per 100,000 reported among non-incarcerated adults in those states during the same period. ``In some large correctional systems, the incidence of TB has increased dramatically,'' the CDC said, noting that in New York state there were 106 TB cases per 100,000 inmates in 1986 _ seven times more than the average of 15 cases reported in 1976-78.
 In California, the rate was nearly six times higher _ 80 per 100,000.
 The spread of AIDS-virus infections may play a part in the spread of TB in prisons, the CDC said.
 AIDS weakens the immune system, making patients susceptible to infections other people might ward off, including tuberculosis.
