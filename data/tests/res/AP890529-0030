(AP) </DATELINE> <TEXT> Forecasters preparing for Thursday's opening of the Atlantic hurricane season wish they could predict the arrival of new technological help they say may be crucial to ever-growing coastal populations.
 The Air Force has agreed to fly hurricane reconnaissance flights for two more years, but has made it clear it plans to phase out the missions.
 And only one satellite is available for tracking hurricanes. ``We just have nothing right now to lean on,'' says Ken McKinnon, a spokesman for U.S.
 If it blinks, how do you track weather?'' The Air Force doesn't want to be involved. ``We have in the last few years examined our need for manned weather reconnaissance and feel there's no real compelling military reason,'' said spokesman Lt.
 Since 1985, Sheets said, there seem to be more hurricanes and they're more likely to hit the United States. ``We may be in an upswing,'' he said, ``possibly back to the pattern of the '40s, '50s and '60s when we had a tremendous number of landfall hurricanes.'' Max Mayfield, hurricane specialist at the National Weather Service in Miami, said experts don't known enough yet about hurricanes to tell if this is just a peak in activity, or a return to the 50s and 60s. ``Now we can see past the Antilles out into the Atlantic, and over toward Hawaii on the west,'' said forecaster Hal Gerrish. ``We'd like to be able to see all the way to Africa,'' which is where Atlantic hurricanes develop, he said.
