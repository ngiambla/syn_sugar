 Suspected communist rebels today killed the police chief of the Philippines' major financial center in an escalation of street violence sweeping the capital area, police said.
 Herminio Taylo, 54, police chief of Makati, had just finished jogging and was buying fruit in a public market when two assassins opened fire with .45-caliber pistols, police said.
 The military says communist rebels have killed up to 65 soldiers and police in the capital region since January.
