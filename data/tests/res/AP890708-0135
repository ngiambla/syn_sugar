 The fact that there are more acres burned this year, but fewer fires, ``means this year's fires are in very rugged, inaccessible terrain, which makes them hard to fight,'' said Hartigan. ``Also, some of them are in areas where there have not been any fires for years, and that means there is excellent fuel available.'' The largest fire in the Lower 48 states was the week-old Diamond Peak fire in Utah, which had burned 12,200 acres of forest and brush in an area 20 miles west of the Utah-Colorado border, just north of Interstate 70.
