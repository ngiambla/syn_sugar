 Thousands more acres of brush and timber went up in smoke Saturday in seven states in the West, threatening homes in some places, and firefighters contended with wind and high temperatures. ``As the day heats up, you'll get these reburns going out and the trees dry out and they'll torch,'' said Forest Service spokesman Ed Christian in Wyoming. ``We hope Mother Nature cooperates with us,'' said Mary Plumb of the federal Bureau of Land Management in Utah.
 Record highs included 97 at Cheyenne, Wyo., and 100 at Denver, while Casper, Wyo., tied its record of 100.
 Fire crews were at work in Utah, Wyoming, Colorado, New Mexico, Arizona, California and Washington.
