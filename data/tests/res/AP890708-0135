 Thousands more acres of brush and timber went up in smoke Saturday in seven states in the West, threatening homes in some places, and firefighters contended with wind and high temperatures. ``As the day heats up, you'll get these reburns going out and the trees dry out and they'll torch,'' said Forest Service spokesman Ed Christian in Wyoming. ``We hope Mother Nature cooperates with us,'' said Mary Plumb of the federal Bureau of Land Management in Utah.
 The Boise Interagency Fire Center in Idaho, which coordinates federal firefighting efforts, listed 7,000 to 7,500 people on the fire lines, along with 42 air tankers, 14 guide planes and 10 helicopters, spokesman Arnold Hartigan said Saturday.
 Forest Service spokeswoman Cece Stewart said three helicopters scattered incendiary bombs made of chemically treated plastic balls on an unburned 200-acre area between fire lines and the main fire in an effort to stop the fire's advance.
 Relentless winds first pushed the fire north, then south, prompting Sheriff Ron Jarrel to order the evacuation of a sparsely populated area about a mile south of the fire line, Reider said.
 In the Sierra foothills near Oroville, north of Sacramento, a 750-acre fire was contained Saturday after burning four homes, six outbuildings and six vehicles, and forcing about 150 residents to flee briefly Friday night, according to the California Department of Forestry.
 Firefighters gained the upper hand on a trio of forest fires in Colorado's drought-stricken mountains Saturday, but a new blaze of an estimated 3,000 acres in grass and timber on the eastern plains had crews scrambling to protect a subdivision in Elbert County.
 In the Bridger-Teton National Forest in western Wyoming, a fire had grown to 3,420 acres, burning an additional 1,000 acres in 24 hours, according to forest officials.
 Forest spokesman Ed Christian said the fire was about 50 percent contained by Saturday night and that with some cooperation from the weather, crews should be able to complete their containment line by Monday.
 Officials in Arizona gave priority to the Marijilda fire, which had blackened 2,500 acres of forest on the north side of Mount Graham near Safford, and the Chiva fire east of Tucson, which had burned 8,300 acres in the Rincon Mountains, according to BLM spokesman Wendell Peacock.
 Firefighters spent an eighth day Saturday battling the lightning-caused, 8,139-acre Divide fire 50 miles northeast of Silver City in the Gila National Forest in southwestern New Mexico, U.S.
