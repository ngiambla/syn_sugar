 MEARS</BYLINE> <BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE> <DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE> <TEXT> Simply put, the question was who should be counted as a person and who, if anybody, should not.
 The Senate voted one answer and, in effect, invited the Supreme Court to decide whether it was right or wrong.
 That happened because in the arithmetic of congressional reapportionment, every question becomes complex, contentious and politically charged.
 The point at issue in Senate debate on a new immigration bill was whether illegal aliens should be counted in the process that will reallocate House seats among states after the 1990 census.
 There could be enough of them to shift seats away from at least five states to Sun Belt states with large numbers of illegal residents.
 The government made no attempt to count them out in the redistricting process; indeed, the two previous administrations decided that the Constitution required that the census cover illegal aliens along with citizens.
 The Senate has passed an immigration bill including an amendment that would cut illegal aliens from the redistricting numbers, but it is not likely to clear Congress before the next year's national head count.
