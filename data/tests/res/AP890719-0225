 Simply put, the question was who should be counted as a person and who, if anybody, should not.
 But there's nothing simple about it.
 The Senate voted one answer and, in effect, invited the Supreme Court to decide whether it was right or wrong.
 That happened because in the arithmetic of congressional reapportionment, every question becomes complex, contentious and politically charged.
 The point at issue in Senate debate on a new immigration bill was whether illegal aliens should be counted in the process that will reallocate House seats among states after the 1990 census.
 Then again, the Census Bureau maintains that not including them, and still coming up with an accurate 1990 population count, would be even more difficult. ``A census of only legal residents cannot be done as accurately as a census of all residents,'' according to Census Bureau testimony to Congress.
 The Senate has passed an immigration bill including an amendment that would cut illegal aliens from the redistricting numbers, but it is not likely to clear Congress before the next year's national head count.
