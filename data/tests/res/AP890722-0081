 Prosecutors had argued that the amendment's backers did not intend to allow felons to own guns, but the judge said nothing in the amendment indicated such an intent. ``If Maine legislators and citizens wanted to restrict or qualify the right to keep and bear arms, they could have enacted a constitutional provision that contained the desired restrictions,'' Perkins wrote. ``Maine's right to keep and bear arms amendment is the most broad and least restrictive of any of the 43 similar state amendments,'' he wrote.
