 A 1987 state constitutional amendment broadening the right to bear arms means that even convicted felons may own guns, a judge ruled.
 Cumberland County Superior Court Justice Stephen L.
 Perkins on Friday dismissed a charge of possession of a firearm by a felon against Edward Brown of Cumberland.
 Tierney said Saturday that the case would be appealed, adding, ``With all due respect to Justice Perkins, we think he is wrong.'' The Maine constitution used to guaranteed the right to keep and bear arms ``for the common defense.'' In 1986, the Maine Supreme Court upheld a gun violation by focusing on the ``common defense'' phrase.
 The amendment declared, ``Every citizen has a right to keep and bear arms,and this right shall never be questioned.'' Brown had been accused of criminal threatening in 1988, as well as with illegal possession of a gun.
