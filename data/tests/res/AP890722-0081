 Prosecutors had argued that the amendment's backers did not intend to allow felons to own guns, but the judge said nothing in the amendment indicated such an intent. ``If Maine legislators and citizens wanted to restrict or qualify the right to keep and bear arms, they could have enacted a constitutional provision that contained the desired restrictions,'' Perkins wrote. ``Maine's right to keep and bear arms amendment is the most broad and least restrictive of any of the 43 similar state amendments,'' he wrote.
 Tierney said Saturday that the case would be appealed, adding, ``With all due respect to Justice Perkins, we think he is wrong.'' The Maine constitution used to guaranteed the right to keep and bear arms ``for the common defense.'' In 1986, the Maine Supreme Court upheld a gun violation by focusing on the ``common defense'' phrase.
 The amendment declared, ``Every citizen has a right to keep and bear arms,and this right shall never be questioned.'' Brown had been accused of criminal threatening in 1988, as well as with illegal possession of a gun.
