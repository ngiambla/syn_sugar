 This week's flare-up of Western wildfires can't hold a candle to the damage wrought by last year's record-breaking fire season, but officials say a dry August could change everything.
 Fire has charred more than 1.3 million acres of forest and range land since January in the contiguous United States, compared to 2.1 million acres by this time last year, fire officials said Monday. ``Right now, the fire season is just starting to gear up,'' said Sandi Sacher, spokeswoman at the federal government's wildfire command post in Boise, Idaho.
