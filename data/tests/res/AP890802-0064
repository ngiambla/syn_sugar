 Undocumented aliens are largely concentrated in the South, West and industrial states like New York, and other states fear a loss of power to those areas if the aliens are counted.
 The Census Bureau's $4 billion budget for the census is large enough to identify and separate out the illegal aliens, he said.
 Mervyn Dymally, D-Calif., charged the debate is really over population shifts that will lead to more House seats for southern and western states. ``Pennsylvania, I don't care what they do, unless they go down to the Southwest and bring the people back, they're going to lose a seat,'' said Dymally.
