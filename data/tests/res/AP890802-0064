 SCHMID</BYLINE> <BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE> <DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE> <TEXT> A major issue hanging over the 1990 Census is resolved with the decision to include military personnel stationed overseas, but Congress is arguing over whether to keep counting illegal aliens.
 The House blocked an effort Tuesday to require aliens to be excluded from the census numbers used in House reapportionment every decade.
 Census figures are used to redistribute the 435 House seats among the states every 10 years and to distribute federal aid to local governments.
 The reapportionment issue has riveted the attention of House members from states where slow growth threatens to result in losses of House seats.
 Undocumented aliens are largely concentrated in the South, West and industrial states like New York, and other states fear a loss of power to those areas if the aliens are counted.
