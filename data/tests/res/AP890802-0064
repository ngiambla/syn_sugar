 A major issue hanging over the 1990 Census is resolved with the decision to include military personnel stationed overseas, but Congress is arguing over whether to keep counting illegal aliens.
 Census figures are used to redistribute the 435 House seats among the states every 10 years and to distribute federal aid to local governments.
 The reapportionment issue has riveted the attention of House members from states where slow growth threatens to result in losses of House seats.
 Undocumented aliens are largely concentrated in the South, West and industrial states like New York, and other states fear a loss of power to those areas if the aliens are counted.
 The Commerce Department settled that problem by announcing it will work with the Defense Department on ways to count the 1.2 million to 1.6 million military and civilian defense workers who live overseas.
 That has yet to be decided, but possibilities include counting the state where the person owns a home or the last state where he or she lived for at least six months.
 Opponents noted the Constitution requires House seats to be apportioned based on all the ``persons'' residing in a state. ``Every census since the Constitution was created has counted all residents of the states, both citizens and non-citizens,'' observed Rep.
 The Census Bureau's $4 billion budget for the census is large enough to identify and separate out the illegal aliens, he said.
 Mervyn Dymally, D-Calif., charged the debate is really over population shifts that will lead to more House seats for southern and western states. ``Pennsylvania, I don't care what they do, unless they go down to the Southwest and bring the people back, they're going to lose a seat,'' said Dymally.
 It may be constitutional, but it's just not right.'' Census officials generally have opposed any attempt to delete illegal aliens, contending they cannot determine who is in the country legally.
