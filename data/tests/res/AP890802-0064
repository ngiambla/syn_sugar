 A major issue hanging over the 1990 Census is resolved with the decision to include military personnel stationed overseas, but Congress is arguing over whether to keep counting illegal aliens.
 Census figures are used to redistribute the 435 House seats among the states every 10 years and to distribute federal aid to local governments.
 The reapportionment issue has riveted the attention of House members from states where slow growth threatens to result in losses of House seats.
 That has yet to be decided, but possibilities include counting the state where the person owns a home or the last state where he or she lived for at least six months.
 The Census Bureau's $4 billion budget for the census is large enough to identify and separate out the illegal aliens, he said.
