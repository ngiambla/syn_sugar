 Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico and nearby islands to bolt down everything loose and stock up on food and water Wednesday as Hurricane Dean rumbled through the eastern Caribbean.
 Dean was upgraded from a tropical storm to the second hurricane of the Atlantic season Wednesday, and by nightfall the National Weather Center in Puerto Rico reported the hurricane's winds had strengthened to 80 mph.
 At midnight EDT, forecasters reported the center of the hurricane was at latitude 18.5 north and longitude 61.3 west, moving westerly at 15 mph.
 Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico advised residents to ``secure loose objects or move them indoors,'' board or tape windows and stock up on emergency supplies such as drinking water, food that needs no refrigeration and batteries. ``This is a dangerous storm and should not be taken lightly, even though it is a minimal hurricane,'' it said. ``Don't take chances.
 A hurricane advisory said aircraft reports indicated Dean's center was moving westward after making a temporary jog northwest. ``This increases the threat to the northern Leeward islands,'' it said.
 Forecasters said the storm was expected to first hit land in Barbuda, the easternmost Leeward Island and move northwest toward the U.S.
 Government radio in the twin island state of Antigua and Barbuda said Dean was expected to hit Barbuda on Wednesday night, and warned residents to bar windows, latch down loose objects and stock up on water.
