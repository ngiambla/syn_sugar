 On Saturday, there were about 220,000 acres ablaze in four states, with 102,000 of them in Idaho and the rest in Oregon, California and Utah. ``Tell me when the airplane's got to leave and I'll have the team on it,'' coordinator Lynn Findley says into the phone cradled on his shoulder.
 Another staff member fields a caller searching for a fire officer called ``Joe Blow.'' ``Can you believe it?'' she says over her shoulder. ``He spells his name B-L-O-U-G-H.'' Others juggle as many as three of the constantly ringing phones, scanning computer terminals for personnel, airplanes, red chemical retardant and gear. ``We drop slimy red mud on burning trees from antique airplanes,'' declares the slogan on one T-shirt.
