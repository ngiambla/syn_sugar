 Lightning has set the West ablaze this summer, and electricity is again surging through the nation's wildfire command post. ``The whole place is running at the max, full out,'' Reed Jarvis of the Boise Interagency Fire Center said last week.
 On Saturday, there were about 220,000 acres ablaze in four states, with 102,000 of them in Idaho and the rest in Oregon, California and Utah. ``Tell me when the airplane's got to leave and I'll have the team on it,'' coordinator Lynn Findley says into the phone cradled on his shoulder.
 Another staff member fields a caller searching for a fire officer called ``Joe Blow.'' ``Can you believe it?'' she says over her shoulder. ``He spells his name B-L-O-U-G-H.'' Others juggle as many as three of the constantly ringing phones, scanning computer terminals for personnel, airplanes, red chemical retardant and gear. ``We drop slimy red mud on burning trees from antique airplanes,'' declares the slogan on one T-shirt.
 Magnets resembling aircraft dot a map of the country, giving the location and type of equipment available. ``Obviously, firefighting on the line is stressful,'' said Fire Center spokesman Arnold Hartigan. ``But the support people are dealing with human life facing fire, which is inherently dangerous.'' Hundreds of fires burned fitfully in the Idaho backcountry for days after the last ``lightning bust.'' One storm laid down 2,000 strikes an hour with little rain.
 The buzz at the wildfire nerve center intensified dramatically. ``Fortunately we don't work at this level all year,'' Hartigan said. ``It would be unbearable if we had to do this 365 days a year.'' The complex has taken on a military look.
 Smoke jumpers sit in the shade of a building waiting for their next leap into 100-foot-tall ponderosa pines, laden with chainsaws or water pumps. ``We are definitely an assault organization,'' Hartigan said. ``It's patterned after military operations because they work.
 We're the supply lines for the troops.'' In the logistics center, specialists spin Lazy Susans with pink and blue requisition forms as each plea from the fire line is answered.
 Until then, the lights will be on at the Fire Center, and the pace will be frenetic. ``It's like Wall Street, it's like an operating room,'' Jarvis says. ``Everybody knows it's stressful, but they're not snapping at each other.
