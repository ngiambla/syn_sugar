 Lightning has set the West ablaze this summer, and electricity is again surging through the nation's wildfire command post. ``The whole place is running at the max, full out,'' Reed Jarvis of the Boise Interagency Fire Center said last week.

 He hangs up, makes another call and arranges for a procurement expert to fly from Atlanta to LaGrande, Ore.
 Magnets resembling aircraft dot a map of the country, giving the location and type of equipment available. ``Obviously, firefighting on the line is stressful,'' said Fire Center spokesman Arnold Hartigan. ``But the support people are dealing with human life facing fire, which is inherently dangerous.'' Hundreds of fires burned fitfully in the Idaho backcountry for days after the last ``lightning bust.'' One storm laid down 2,000 strikes an hour with little rain.
