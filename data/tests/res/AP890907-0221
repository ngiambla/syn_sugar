 In a rare conversation with reporters, a Shining Path political officer, who spoke only on condition he not be identified, gave an example of the kind of law the guerrillas have laid down: ``Do not steal so much as a needle or thread and return what you borrow.'' In a nation where economic chaos reigns and few laws are respected, the Shining Path is setting down clear rules and making them stick. ``In a sense they enforce a hyper-Christian morality _ except they kill you if you break the rules,'' said the Rev.
 A few months earlier the rebels executed eight youths near Tingo Maria for smoking cigarettes laced with semi-refined cocaine. ``People have had to discipline themselves,'' said Raul Aranda, an agronomist in Tingo Maria, explaining the effects of ``revolutionary justice.'' ``In rural areas a man must be faithful to his wife and is permitted to go drinking only once a week.
 But here in the jungle-cloaked Upper Huallaga Valley, the world's largest source of coca leaf, the Shining Path _ ``Sendero Luminoso'' in Spanish _ enjoys the support of tens of thousands of farmers because the rebels protect them against a U.S.-funded coca eradication program.
 The rebels charge coca farmers a ``tax'' of 10 to 15 percent on the earnings from the sale of their crops to drug traffickers, who process the leaf into paste and sell it to Colombian cocaine dealers.
 For the coca and for revenge,'' said Carlos Ferrer, a taxi driver who travels the road between Tingo Maria and Aucayacu. ``When the government began trying to wipe out coca, police came and mistreated people.
 Even top government officials in Lima say there is much truth to the complaints. ``A cop in the Huallaga Valley expects to be bribed,'' said a senior Interior Ministry official, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``He figures it's a right coming to him.
 A half dozen peasants complained in separate interviews that to obtain a farm loan from the local Banco Agrario they have to kick back 25 percent of the loan to bank officials. ``What I've heard is that if you want to be named a teacher in the valley,'' said Feeley, ``it's three months salary as payment.
 And if you're a woman, also the bed.'' The Shining Path has been quick to kill local officials they deemed to be corrupt, according to residents of the valley. ``If the Shining Path has the image of an organization that's fighting corruption in a very corrupt place, that's going to win them some points,'' Feeley said.
