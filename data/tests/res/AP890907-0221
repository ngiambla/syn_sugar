 The Maoist Shining Path guerrillas who dominate Peru's Upper Huallaga River Valley have brought their own law and order to a cocaine-corrupted, violence-ridden region.
 Their bodies were dumped into the river.
 In the bleak Andean highlands, where the rebels launched their insurgency in May, 1980, they have slain thousands of peasants in attacks on villages they viewed as traitors to the rebel cause.
 Although they prohibit drug consumption, the guerrillas defend coca production as an important source of income for the peasants.
 Their only condition is that the semi-refined coca paste be sent out of Peru.
