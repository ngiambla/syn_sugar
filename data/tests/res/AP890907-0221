 The Maoist Shining Path guerrillas who dominate Peru's Upper Huallaga River Valley have brought their own law and order to a cocaine-corrupted, violence-ridden region.
 Shopkeepers say the guerrillas never fail to pay for the food and supplies they acquire in the villages.
 The same shopkeepers complain bitterly about the local police who take what they want without ever offering to pay.
 In late July four young homosexual men who rendezvoused at a bridge a few miles outside Tingo Maria, 35 miles south of here, were set upon and killed by the rebels.
 Violators are warned only once.'' Villagers say they are told, ``The revolution has a thousand eyes and a thousand ears.'' Peru's elected officials have painted the Shining Path insurgents as lunatic killers.
