 With a system they call ``revolutionary justice,'' they have banned drug abuse, prostitution, homosexuality and thievery from the villages they control. ``Two years ago you could not travel the roads without being held up, but the `companeros' put an end to that,'' said cab driver David Nicolas, referring to the guerrillas by the Spanish term for comrades. ``They killed a few bandits and the rest got the message.'' Much of the appeal of the rebels is rooted in their reputation for almost puritanical honesty.
 In a rare conversation with reporters, a Shining Path political officer, who spoke only on condition he not be identified, gave an example of the kind of law the guerrillas have laid down: ``Do not steal so much as a needle or thread and return what you borrow.'' In a nation where economic chaos reigns and few laws are respected, the Shining Path is setting down clear rules and making them stick. ``In a sense they enforce a hyper-Christian morality _ except they kill you if you break the rules,'' said the Rev.
