 The Maoist Shining Path guerrillas who dominate Peru's Upper Huallaga River Valley have brought their own law and order to a cocaine-corrupted, violence-ridden region.
 A few months earlier the rebels executed eight youths near Tingo Maria for smoking cigarettes laced with semi-refined cocaine. ``People have had to discipline themselves,'' said Raul Aranda, an agronomist in Tingo Maria, explaining the effects of ``revolutionary justice.'' ``In rural areas a man must be faithful to his wife and is permitted to go drinking only once a week.
 Violators are warned only once.'' Villagers say they are told, ``The revolution has a thousand eyes and a thousand ears.'' Peru's elected officials have painted the Shining Path insurgents as lunatic killers.
 For the coca and for revenge,'' said Carlos Ferrer, a taxi driver who travels the road between Tingo Maria and Aucayacu. ``When the government began trying to wipe out coca, police came and mistreated people.
 They robbed peasants; they raped their women.'' That view of the police as corrupt and abusive of their power is widely held in the valley.
