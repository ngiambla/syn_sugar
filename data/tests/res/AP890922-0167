 The real forecasting problem with Hugo was predicting the intensity of the storm, which was upgraded to a Category 4 hurricane just hours before it slammed into Charleston. ``It is very difficult to predict changes in intensity because we don't have very reliable computer models for that,'' McAdie said. ``We really need to improve on our forecasting ability of strength.'' The hurricane specialists were surprised by the last-minute increase in wind speed, which was reported to them by Air Force reconnaissance.
 Emmanuel of the Massachussetts Institute of Technology criticizes the current forecasting system. ``Congress and the American people are suffering from the collective delusion that our data problems have been solved by satellites and that just isn't true,'' Emmanuel said.
 Satellites can give a ``pretty picture,'' he said, but not enough information about the wind and temperatures that affect a hurricane's path. ``Most of the information actually used to predict hurricanes comes from flying airplanes into the hurricane, and they do a very good job,'' Emmanuel said.
