 Supercomputers, satellites and the expertise of several hurricane forecasters predicted the destructive path Hurricane Hugo would follow, giving people plenty of time to flee the South Carolina coast.
 The real forecasting problem with Hugo was predicting the intensity of the storm, which was upgraded to a Category 4 hurricane just hours before it slammed into Charleston. ``It is very difficult to predict changes in intensity because we don't have very reliable computer models for that,'' McAdie said. ``We really need to improve on our forecasting ability of strength.'' The hurricane specialists were surprised by the last-minute increase in wind speed, which was reported to them by Air Force reconnaissance.
 Using the information from the satellite, supercomputers at the National Meteorological Center in Suitland, Md., send information to the hurricane center where a tracking model constantly changes to account for current weather conditions and the position of the hurricane.
 To determine the track of the storm, the forecasters analyze supercomputer predictions, satellite data, the history of similar storms and the current path of the hurricane.
 Emmanuel of the Massachussetts Institute of Technology criticizes the current forecasting system. ``Congress and the American people are suffering from the collective delusion that our data problems have been solved by satellites and that just isn't true,'' Emmanuel said.
