 To determine the track of the storm, the forecasters analyze supercomputer predictions, satellite data, the history of similar storms and the current path of the hurricane.
 Meteorology professor Kerry A.
 Emmanuel of the Massachussetts Institute of Technology criticizes the current forecasting system. ``Congress and the American people are suffering from the collective delusion that our data problems have been solved by satellites and that just isn't true,'' Emmanuel said.
