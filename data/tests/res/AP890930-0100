 Two days of racially charged hearings on police brutality and a report detailing widespread segregation in the nation's third-largest city show the new mayor must still heal some old wounds.
 Daley was elected mayor April 4 amid fears by black activists that he would bring back the machine politics of his late father, Richard J.
 The racial issue resurfaced last week in two days of special hearings called by a City Council committee to look into allegations of police brutality against blacks. ``There's been no demonstrable change on the part of white leadership in this city to end racism,'' said Bob Starks, associate professor of inner city studies at Northeastern Illinois University. ``It's the same stuff, and it's seemingly getting worse.'' But Daley maintains that what's getting worse is ``irresponsible political rhetoric'' from black politicians who are looking ahead to the 1991 mayoral election.
 The report, based on a 15-month investigation of the city's race relations, concluded that racial divisions ``threaten to make Chicago an increasingly unpleasant place to live and are antithetical to the city's economic growth and prosperity.'' At the City Council hearings Thursday and Friday, blacks who alleged they were the victims of police brutality accused officers _ most of them white _ of unprovoked beatings, false arrests, intimidation and insulting them with racial slurs.
 Among them was a 55-year-old grandmother, Callie Bryant, who testified that she and her daughter were beaten up in 1987 by seven white police officers who gave her ``the sign of the Ku Klux Klan.'' Two teen-age boys testified that in August they were picked up by white officers, roughed up, and then dropped off in a white neighborhood where they were attacked by white youths.
