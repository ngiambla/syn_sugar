 Two days of racially charged hearings on police brutality and a report detailing widespread segregation in the nation's third-largest city show the new mayor must still heal some old wounds.
 Daley was elected mayor April 4 amid fears by black activists that he would bring back the machine politics of his late father, Richard J.
 The younger Daley emphasized empowerment of minorities in his spring campaign, and after defeating black challengers in the primary and general election, he named minorities to 11 of his 21 Cabinet positions.
 The racial issue resurfaced last week in two days of special hearings called by a City Council committee to look into allegations of police brutality against blacks. ``There's been no demonstrable change on the part of white leadership in this city to end racism,'' said Bob Starks, associate professor of inner city studies at Northeastern Illinois University. ``It's the same stuff, and it's seemingly getting worse.'' But Daley maintains that what's getting worse is ``irresponsible political rhetoric'' from black politicians who are looking ahead to the 1991 mayoral election.
 Daley has denounced the alleged police brutality. ``I will not ever tolerate police brutality, bias or bigotry in the city of Chicago,'' Daley said. ``Everyone should join together ... to help alleviate this problem.'' Also last week, a human relations task force made up of business and civic leaders released a report saying racism in Chicago was fueled by ``a shocking lack of contact'' between the city's ethnic groups.
