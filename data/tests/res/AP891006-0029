Watching Johnson was his chief nemesis: Carl Lewis, the man who was awarded the Olympic gold medals Johnson lost. ``I think it's great,'' Lewis said of the legislation. ``They're making a move and it's very positive.
 The lawmakers emphasized the increasing abuse of steroids by college, high school and even junior high school athletes who believe the substance will enhance their performance. ``America is about to have an adolescent time-bomb explode in its hands,'' Levine said. ``But if we act quickly enough to restrict steroid distribution, and to increase the penalties for illicit distribution, we can prevent this plague from spreading.'' Levine referred to the abuse of steroids as ``the silent side of the drug disease in this country.'' He applauded Johnson's courage for attending the news conference.
 Johnson later stepped up to the microphones and in a quiet voice with a slight stutter told other athletes not to make the same mistake he did, urging them ``to come forward, to come clean.'' Lewis dismissed reporters' questions that he had used steroids, indicating he would be willing to run against Johnson ``if he comes back and he's clean.'' While Lewis held the spotlight, Johnson slipped away to adjoining congressional offices. ``He's not here to compete with Carl Lewis.
