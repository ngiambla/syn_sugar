 The major earthquake that struck the San Francisco Bay area Tuesday occurred in a region seismologists targeted as having the highest probability of a strong quake in Northern California.
 Geological Survey placed the probability of an earthquake of 6.5 magnitude on the Richter scale at 30 percent by the year 2018 in the Southern Santa Cruz mountains.
 He noted that the 1988 report, titled ``Probabilities of Large Earthquakes Occurring in California on the San Andreas Fault,'' presented information that was already widely known among scientists.
 Initial reports indicated widespread damage from Tuesday's quake, especially affecting highways and old masonry buildings. ``It's not like an earthquake of this size in this area is a calamitous event.
 The damage in the Bay area occurred to the same kind of structures heavily damaged in the 1987 Whittier quake in the Los Angeles area, which registered a 5.9 Richter reading, Allen said. ``I think we'll learn a lot from an engineering point of view from this earthquake,'' he said. ``What will be important is to see how the modern structures behaved.'' Allen said many of the same kinds of older structures that appeared to have been damaged in San Francisco also exist in the Los Angeles region.
 In addition, some of the roadways and overpasses in the area have roughly the same kind of construction as the Bay Bridge.
