 The major earthquake that struck the San Francisco Bay area Tuesday occurred in a region seismologists targeted as having the highest probability of a strong quake in Northern California.
 Geological Survey placed the probability of an earthquake of 6.5 magnitude on the Richter scale at 30 percent by the year 2018 in the Southern Santa Cruz mountains.
 It just has to do with the probability of an earthquake in this area,'' Allen said.
 The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on seismographs.
 A reading of 6 can cause severe damage.
