 The preliminary reading of 7.2 is slightly stronger than the 7.1 magnitude earthquake that hit the San Francisco Bay area Oct. 17.
 The earthquake struck the islands at 8:05 a.m. today, or 5:05 p.m.
 Major earthquakes in the Solomons usually don't cause much damage or many casualties because the area is sparsely populated and not extensively developed.
