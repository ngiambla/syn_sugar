 A major earthquake registering 7.2 on the Richter scale shook the Solomon Islands in the South Pacific today, the U.S.
 Geological Survey says.
 The preliminary reading of 7.2 is slightly stronger than the 7.1 magnitude earthquake that hit the San Francisco Bay area Oct. 17.
 The earthquake struck the islands at 8:05 a.m. today, or 5:05 p.m.
 It was the largest earthquake in the Solomons since a 7.4 quake on Nov. 5, 1978.
 There were no immediate reports of injury or damage.
 Major earthquakes in the Solomons usually don't cause much damage or many casualties because the area is sparsely populated and not extensively developed.
 The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center in Honolulu said no Pacific-wide tsunami _ popularly called a tidal wave _ was generated by the quake, but some areas might see small changes in sea levels.
 The survey's earthquake monitors in Golden, Colo., said early seismograph readings placed the epicenter of Saturday's earthquake about 200 miles southeast of Honiaria, which is on Guadacanal Island and is the capital of the Solomons.
 An earthquake of 3.5 on the Richter scale can cause slight damage in the local area, 4 moderate damage, 5 considerable damage, 6 severe damage.
