 A major earthquake registering 7.2 on the Richter scale shook the Solomon Islands in the South Pacific today, the U.S.
 The earthquake struck the islands at 8:05 a.m. today, or 5:05 p.m.
 Saturday's earthquake was the strongest in the world in five months, Finley said.
 The survey's earthquake monitors in Golden, Colo., said early seismograph readings placed the epicenter of Saturday's earthquake about 200 miles southeast of Honiaria, which is on Guadacanal Island and is the capital of the Solomons.
 The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on seismographs.
