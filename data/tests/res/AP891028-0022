 A major earthquake registering 7.2 on the Richter scale shook the Solomon Islands in the South Pacific today, the U.S.
 The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center in Honolulu said no Pacific-wide tsunami _ popularly called a tidal wave _ was generated by the quake, but some areas might see small changes in sea levels.
