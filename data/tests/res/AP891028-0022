 A major earthquake registering 7.2 on the Richter scale shook the Solomon Islands in the South Pacific today, the U.S.
 The preliminary reading of 7.2 is slightly stronger than the 7.1 magnitude earthquake that hit the San Francisco Bay area Oct. 17.
 It was the largest earthquake in the Solomons since a 7.4 quake on Nov. 5, 1978.
 The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center in Honolulu said no Pacific-wide tsunami _ popularly called a tidal wave _ was generated by the quake, but some areas might see small changes in sea levels.
 The survey's earthquake monitors in Golden, Colo., said early seismograph readings placed the epicenter of Saturday's earthquake about 200 miles southeast of Honiaria, which is on Guadacanal Island and is the capital of the Solomons.
 That places the earthquake just east of San Cristobal, the easternmost island in the Solomons chain and about 1,300 miles northeast of Brisbane, Australia.
 An earthquake of 3.5 on the Richter scale can cause slight damage in the local area, 4 moderate damage, 5 considerable damage, 6 severe damage.
