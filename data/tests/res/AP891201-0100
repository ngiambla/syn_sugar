 The government of the northern republic of Slovenia said Friday that Serbia, in the south and east, is attempting to ``oust us from Yugoslavia.'' The statement from the Slovenian presidency followed Serbia's decision Tuesday to ban all political and economic contacts with Slovenia.
 But the Serbian action Tuesday was the gravest threat to the unity of the Yugoslav federation since the death of the nation's post-World War II leader Josip Broz Tito in 1980.
 Earlier Friday 13 people were arrested when police dispersed a crowd of about 100 gathered for a pro-Serbian rally in Ljubljana that had been prohibited by Slovenian authorities.
 In its statement, Slovenia's collective presidency called Serbia's action ``a flagrant violation of all constitutional, legal and civilized norms.'' ``We shall never permit anyone to drive us away or oust us from Yugoslavia,'' it said. ``Yugoslavia is our country.
 Aleksandar Prlja, Serbia's secretary for foreign affairs, told The Associated Press that Slovenia's ``banning of the peaceful rally was deeply humiliating for the Serbian people. ``This is irreconcilable with joint existence in a federal state.'' Slovenian officials said the rally had been organized by Serbian politicians trying to oust the Slovenian leadership.
