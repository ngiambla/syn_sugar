 The government of the northern republic of Slovenia said Friday that Serbia, in the south and east, is attempting to ``oust us from Yugoslavia.'' The statement from the Slovenian presidency followed Serbia's decision Tuesday to ban all political and economic contacts with Slovenia.
 In its statement, Slovenia's collective presidency called Serbia's action ``a flagrant violation of all constitutional, legal and civilized norms.'' ``We shall never permit anyone to drive us away or oust us from Yugoslavia,'' it said. ``Yugoslavia is our country.
 Those who do not acknowledge this separate themselves from the federal state.'' It denounced the Serbian communist leadership, saying, ``We do not accept a comprehensive control of a single truth, of political uniformity, authoritarianism and intolerance, of ideologic monolithism.'' Serbia is the largest of Yugoslavia's six republics.
 Aleksandar Prlja, Serbia's secretary for foreign affairs, told The Associated Press that Slovenia's ``banning of the peaceful rally was deeply humiliating for the Serbian people. ``This is irreconcilable with joint existence in a federal state.'' Slovenian officials said the rally had been organized by Serbian politicians trying to oust the Slovenian leadership.
