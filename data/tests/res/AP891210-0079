 The Associated Press went back to track where the $3.9 billion went and found the money spread far beyond the drought.
 The politics of 1988 and the media attention the drought received _ a steady bombardment of print and electronic images of shriveled cornstalks and cracked, dusty fields _ played key roles in rushing through the nation's largest ever disaster relief measure. ``Being an election year, there were a lot of concessions to farmers,'' said Dan Otto, a professor at Iowa State University. ``(The politicians) were trying to get recognized as a friend of agriculture.'' In the end, drought relief became a one-time bonus for thousands of farmers in parts of the country that in 1988 generally enjoyed good crops at higher prices and wouldn't have qualified as disaster areas, including parts of California, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, Oklahoma, Maryland and New Jersey.
