 America's 1988 drought captured attention everywhere, but especially in Washington where politicians pushed through the largest disaster relief measure in U.S. history.
 The record $3.9 billion drought relief program of 1988, hailed as salvation for small farmers devastated by a brutal dry spell, became much more _ an unexpected, election-year windfall for thousands of farmers who collected millions of dollars for nature's normal quirks.
 An Associated Press study conducted over seven months found the drought relief bill paid cash to farmers for everything from hail-damaged kiwi fruit in California to heat-stressed radicchio in Massachusetts, rain-bloated tomatoes in New Jersey and washed-out bird seed in Colorado.
 Payments went far beyond the initial intent to save Midwestern grain growers from bankruptcy, an effort _ supported by almost everyone _ that simply grew and grew and grew.
 The taxpayers' tab ran to $3.9 billion. ``We lucked out last year on account of the boys up north,'' said Travis Turnipseed, a Levelland, Texas, cotton farmer who's had hail damage 23 out of the last 28 years, but collected cash for the first time in 1988.
