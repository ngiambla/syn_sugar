 The record $3.9 billion drought relief program of 1988, hailed as salvation for small farmers devastated by a brutal dry spell, became much more _ an unexpected, election-year windfall for thousands of farmers who collected millions of dollars for nature's normal quirks.
 An Associated Press study conducted over seven months found the drought relief bill paid cash to farmers for everything from hail-damaged kiwi fruit in California to heat-stressed radicchio in Massachusetts, rain-bloated tomatoes in New Jersey and washed-out bird seed in Colorado.
 By the end of this October, about one-quarter of all U.S. farmers had collected on damage to most of 506 eligible crops and just about any kind of weather peril in 49 states.
 The taxpayers' tab ran to $3.9 billion. ``We lucked out last year on account of the boys up north,'' said Travis Turnipseed, a Levelland, Texas, cotton farmer who's had hail damage 23 out of the last 28 years, but collected cash for the first time in 1988.
 The politics of 1988 and the media attention the drought received _ a steady bombardment of print and electronic images of shriveled cornstalks and cracked, dusty fields _ played key roles in rushing through the nation's largest ever disaster relief measure. ``Being an election year, there were a lot of concessions to farmers,'' said Dan Otto, a professor at Iowa State University. ``(The politicians) were trying to get recognized as a friend of agriculture.'' In the end, drought relief became a one-time bonus for thousands of farmers in parts of the country that in 1988 generally enjoyed good crops at higher prices and wouldn't have qualified as disaster areas, including parts of California, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, Oklahoma, Maryland and New Jersey.
 Although some producers appeared to have violated eligibility requirements _ exceeding the allowed gross annual income, for example _ their requests for aid were approved anyway by local officials.
 As tough as farming is, they'd be fools not to take what was offered, they said. ``It was there, so I took it,'' said Melvin Przilas, a wheat and corn farmer in the Texas Panhandle who collected $2,254 because hail and Russian wheat aphids damaged his 1,265-acre irrigated farm, which grosses $300,000 to $400,000 a year.
 Those growers profited by ``triple-dipping'': reaping crop insurance as well as drought aid on damaged crops, then replanting the same ground for a successful harvest _ all perfectly legal under the 1988 program.
 Disaster payments in several states also went to banks, corporations, investment firms, churches and even local governments such as the city of Littlefield, Texas, despite regulations designed to match benefits to small farmers.
 Gresham readily offers that he and his son operate their farms under five different names precisely because of federal payment limitations _ in the case of drought aid, $100,000 per farmer.
