 The record $3.9 billion drought relief program of 1988, hailed as salvation for small farmers devastated by a brutal dry spell, became much more _ an unexpected, election-year windfall for thousands of farmers who collected millions of dollars for nature's normal quirks.
 By the end of this October, about one-quarter of all U.S. farmers had collected on damage to most of 506 eligible crops and just about any kind of weather peril in 49 states.
 Those growers profited by ``triple-dipping'': reaping crop insurance as well as drought aid on damaged crops, then replanting the same ground for a successful harvest _ all perfectly legal under the 1988 program.
 Disaster payments in several states also went to banks, corporations, investment firms, churches and even local governments such as the city of Littlefield, Texas, despite regulations designed to match benefits to small farmers.
 Gresham readily offers that he and his son operate their farms under five different names precisely because of federal payment limitations _ in the case of drought aid, $100,000 per farmer.
