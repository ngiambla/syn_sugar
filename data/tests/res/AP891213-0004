 But for this farmer and others, it was a give-and-take bailout: Take the money with one hand, give it away with the other. ``The guy who sold me $5,000 of fuel, he got paid,'' Grindberg said. ``The business that sold me fertilizer and spray and chemicals and tires, they got paid.
 The money not only helped rescue thousands of farmers; many say it also kept the state afloat. ``It's what carried us through in 1988,'' said Cass County extension agent Duane Hauck. ``If it hadn't been for drought aid, the economic situation all through North Dakota would have been disastrous.
 It was the major source of income for most farmers.'' ``I don't think too many farmers took disaster aid and bought Cadillacs and went on vacation in my area,'' Grindberg added.
 But money did reach areas Congress most intended to aid, including North Dakota, where it kept some farmers on their land and may have prevented some business closures. ``You might say it kept the state alive,'' said Fred Selberg, another farmer in this Red River Valley county. ``Everyone in North Dakota in some way or another was helped.'' North Dakota, where the drought evoked memories of Dust Bowl days with tumbleweed dancing along the barren horizon, received the most disaster dollars.
 Disaster aid and crop insurance pumped about $500 million into Iowa's economy, an Iowa State University study said. ``There was no question it was needed to stave off a major new wave of bankruptcies and financial problems among Corn Belt producers,'' said Mark Edelman, a university economist. ``Even the drought assistance for most farmers fell well short of bringing what their income would be with normal yields, but it provided a safety net,'' he said.
 Good crops the next two years started to reverse the trend, but drought stalled the recovery. ``It has a demoralizing effect when you have a disaster,'' said Dwight Aakre, a North Dakota State economist. ``Financial aid helps to alleviate that.
 The last thing North Dakota needed is more negatives to push us down.'' Despite relief and nearly $200 million in crop insurance, the state still needs ``a good year to get back on our feet,'' Hauck said. ``We didn't get that in '89,'' he added, referring to continuing drought in North Dakota's west and south-central sections.
 For Larry Richard, a 36-year-old father of three who farms 1,000 acres near the town of Horace, $39,000 in aid, even coupled with $55,000 in crop insurance, amounted to ``just enough to break even.
 That's all I had really hoped for.'' If that seems like a lot, Richard, who grows wheat, soybeans and barley, notes it costs him $150,000 for rent, interest, seed, fertilizer, equipment and other necessities. ``You throw a lot of expenses way ahead of what your crop is going to be,'' he said. ``Our investment in farming is tremendous compared to the average businessman.
 Next year, we're going to have to start coming around to a profit.'' Grindberg, who farms 900 acres of wheat, soybeans and barley, was in the red last year despite $70,000 in aid and insurance.
