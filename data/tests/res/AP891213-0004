 More disaster relief aid went there than to any other state.
 The third story in a four-part series, ``Cashing In on the Drought,'' examines how the $3.9 billion disaster aid program helped farmers most in need. </TEXT> <BYLINE>By SHARON COHEN</BYLINE> <BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE> <DATELINE>DAVENPORT, N.D. (AP) </DATELINE> <TEXT> Carl Grindberg survived the drought with a $45,000 dose of federal aid.
 But for this farmer and others, it was a give-and-take bailout: Take the money with one hand, give it away with the other. ``The guy who sold me $5,000 of fuel, he got paid,'' Grindberg said. ``The business that sold me fertilizer and spray and chemicals and tires, they got paid.
 What I'm saying is, the farmer got the money directly, but indirectly a lot of others benefited.'' The 1988 drought relief program poured more than $400 million into North Dakota, the nation's most agriculturally dependent state.
 The money not only helped rescue thousands of farmers; many say it also kept the state afloat. ``It's what carried us through in 1988,'' said Cass County extension agent Duane Hauck. ``If it hadn't been for drought aid, the economic situation all through North Dakota would have been disastrous.
 It was the major source of income for most farmers.'' ``I don't think too many farmers took disaster aid and bought Cadillacs and went on vacation in my area,'' Grindberg added.
 A study of the $3.9 billion disaster relief program, conducted by The Associated Press over seven months, found that outside the Midwest drought area, lax rules and requirements led to thousands of farmers collecting millions of dollars for nothing more serious than the normal trials of nature.
 But money did reach areas Congress most intended to aid, including North Dakota, where it kept some farmers on their land and may have prevented some business closures. ``You might say it kept the state alive,'' said Fred Selberg, another farmer in this Red River Valley county. ``Everyone in North Dakota in some way or another was helped.'' North Dakota, where the drought evoked memories of Dust Bowl days with tumbleweed dancing along the barren horizon, received the most disaster dollars.
 Disaster aid and crop insurance pumped about $500 million into Iowa's economy, an Iowa State University study said. ``There was no question it was needed to stave off a major new wave of bankruptcies and financial problems among Corn Belt producers,'' said Mark Edelman, a university economist. ``Even the drought assistance for most farmers fell well short of bringing what their income would be with normal yields, but it provided a safety net,'' he said.
