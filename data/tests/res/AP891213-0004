 Good crops the next two years started to reverse the trend, but drought stalled the recovery. ``It has a demoralizing effect when you have a disaster,'' said Dwight Aakre, a North Dakota State economist. ``Financial aid helps to alleviate that.
 The last thing North Dakota needed is more negatives to push us down.'' Despite relief and nearly $200 million in crop insurance, the state still needs ``a good year to get back on our feet,'' Hauck said. ``We didn't get that in '89,'' he added, referring to continuing drought in North Dakota's west and south-central sections.
