 More disaster relief aid went there than to any other state.
 But for this farmer and others, it was a give-and-take bailout: Take the money with one hand, give it away with the other. ``The guy who sold me $5,000 of fuel, he got paid,'' Grindberg said. ``The business that sold me fertilizer and spray and chemicals and tires, they got paid.
 What I'm saying is, the farmer got the money directly, but indirectly a lot of others benefited.'' The 1988 drought relief program poured more than $400 million into North Dakota, the nation's most agriculturally dependent state.
 A study of the $3.9 billion disaster relief program, conducted by The Associated Press over seven months, found that outside the Midwest drought area, lax rules and requirements led to thousands of farmers collecting millions of dollars for nothing more serious than the normal trials of nature.
 But money did reach areas Congress most intended to aid, including North Dakota, where it kept some farmers on their land and may have prevented some business closures. ``You might say it kept the state alive,'' said Fred Selberg, another farmer in this Red River Valley county. ``Everyone in North Dakota in some way or another was helped.'' North Dakota, where the drought evoked memories of Dust Bowl days with tumbleweed dancing along the barren horizon, received the most disaster dollars.
