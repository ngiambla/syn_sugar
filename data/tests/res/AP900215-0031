 Black Americans suffer six times more tuberculosis than whites do, and one important reason appears to be a genetic susceptibility to the disease, according to a study today.
 Prison data from Arkansas and Minnesota also found that black inmates were twice as likely as white prisoners to catch the bacteria while incarcerated.
 Another soon-to-be published study reports the discovery of a racial difference in the way blood cells respond to the TB bacteria, which could help explain why blacks seem to be more prone to tuberculosis.
 Stead's study found that blacks got infected more readily than whites, regardless of the race of the person who initially brought the infection into the nursing home.
 In homes where the initial source of the disease was white, 17 percent of blacks and 12 percent of whites caught the infection.
