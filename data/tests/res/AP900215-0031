 Black Americans suffer six times more tuberculosis than whites do, and one important reason appears to be a genetic susceptibility to the disease, according to a study today.
 The research found that when living conditions are identical, black people are twice as likely as whites to get infected with the TB bacteria.
 The relatively high rate of TB among blacks has traditionally been blamed on crowded housing and other conditions of poverty.
 While social factors undoubtedly play a central role, the study suggests that innate susceptibility also contributes. ``We found that there is a systemic difference between whites and blacks,'' said Dr.
 Stead. ``Whites seem to be more able to fend off the organism without it's ever being able to establish an infection.'' Stead, a tuberculosis specialist at the Arkansas Department of Health, discovered the racial difference while analyzing health statistics from nursing homes and prisons. ``It's a very intriguing finding,'' commented Dr.
