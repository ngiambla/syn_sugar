 Black Americans suffer six times more tuberculosis than whites do, and one important reason appears to be a genetic susceptibility to the disease, according to a study today.
 The research found that when living conditions are identical, black people are twice as likely as whites to get infected with the TB bacteria.
 Prison data from Arkansas and Minnesota also found that black inmates were twice as likely as white prisoners to catch the bacteria while incarcerated.
