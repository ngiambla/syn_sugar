 Drugs are now available that can put AIDS patients into remission, and recent advances have made clear that a vaccine to protect against AIDS infection is possible, a panel of AIDS experts said Saturday.
 At the same time, however, the AIDS epidemic is being followed by a suddenly resurgent epidemic of tuberculosis, the scientists said. ``We have now made demonstrable first steps in inducing remission,'' said William Haseltine of the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston. ``I think there is evidence that a substantial number of people who would have died are now alive,'' Haseltine said at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.
 Vaccines to protect animals against AIDS-related viruses have shown some success, he said, encouraging researchers to believe that similar vaccines can be found for humans. ``There's new hope and interest that a vaccine is possible,'' said John McGowan of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in Bethesda, Md.
 In New York City, for example, tuberculosis declined between 1960 and 1977, but is now increasing and has reached the 1960 level again. ``We anticipate in our major cities losing two decades of progress in our tuberculosis control efforts,'' said Vermund.
 And unlike the AIDS virus, which cannot be transmitted through casual contact, tuberculosis is easily transmitted through the air. ``I think we should worry about tuberculosis and the risk to the general population,'' Vermund said.
