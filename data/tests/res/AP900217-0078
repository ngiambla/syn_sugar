 Drugs are now available that can put AIDS patients into remission, and recent advances have made clear that a vaccine to protect against AIDS infection is possible, a panel of AIDS experts said Saturday.
 At the same time, however, the AIDS epidemic is being followed by a suddenly resurgent epidemic of tuberculosis, the scientists said. ``We have now made demonstrable first steps in inducing remission,'' said William Haseltine of the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston. ``I think there is evidence that a substantial number of people who would have died are now alive,'' Haseltine said at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.
