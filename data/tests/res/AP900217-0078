 He cautioned against a premature conclusion that the AIDS epidemic may be coming to an end.
 A year ago, the prospects for an AIDS vaccine looked doubtful, said James Mullins of Stanford University.
 But that has changed. ``There has been a transition in the effort to find a vaccine,'' Mullins said.
 In New York City, for example, tuberculosis declined between 1960 and 1977, but is now increasing and has reached the 1960 level again. ``We anticipate in our major cities losing two decades of progress in our tuberculosis control efforts,'' said Vermund.
 Many of the cases of tuberculosis are occurring when individuals who were exposed to tuberculosis early in life contract AIDS.
