 The Senate had planned to take a roll call on the nomination but changed course at the last minute and confirmed Thomas on a voice vote.
 As chairman of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission over the last eight years, he has been one of the most visible black officials in the Reagan and Bush administrations.
 Thomas, a critic of quotas and affirmative action to fight hiring discrimination, has been highly praised by conservatives.
