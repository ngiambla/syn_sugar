 The Senate today confirmed conservative civil rights official Clarence Thomas as a federal appeals judge, brushing aside complaints about his record from some liberal and senior citizens groups.
 Danforth, Thomas' chief Senate supporter and former employer, said he could vouch for the nominee's abilities as a lawyer. ``I hired him twice,'' Danforth said. ``People say, 'Don't you ever make a mistake?' Well, yeah, but not twice.'' Sen.
 Simpson said the panel's investigation of the employment commission was flawed to begin with. ``They wasted a lot of time trying to nail Clarence Thomas,'' he said.
 Thomas was born in poverty in rural Georgia, worked his way through college and is a graduate of Yale Law School.
 Before becoming chairman of the commission, he worked under Danforth in the Missouri attorney general's office and in the Senate as well for the Monsanto Corp.
