 The Senate today confirmed conservative civil rights official Clarence Thomas as a federal appeals judge, brushing aside complaints about his record from some liberal and senior citizens groups.
 The Senate had planned to take a roll call on the nomination but changed course at the last minute and confirmed Thomas on a voice vote.
 As chairman of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission over the last eight years, he has been one of the most visible black officials in the Reagan and Bush administrations.
