 Assessment studies for these populations are not finished, and even preliminary findings are hard to come by _ researchers have been told by lawyers to save their findings for court, where it seems nearly everyone involved in the spill is headed.
 The state sued, claiming the company was negligent in responding to the spill, only to be countersued by Exxon, which claimed state officials hindered the use of chemical dispersants that could have broken up large quantities of oil early on.
