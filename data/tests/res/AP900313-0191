 Dashing out as the chopper lands, he digs into the cobble beach and quickly finds what he knew he would. ``Oil,'' he says. ``Smell it?'' The pungent odor of petroleum wafts through the air as the hole turns black with crude oil, an oozing remnant of the 10.8 million gallons spilled into Prince William Sound last March 24 by the tanker Exxon Valdez.
 There are hundreds of beaches all over the sound that are still oiled, and the oil is slowly bleeding out. ``The beaches can look beautiful at the surface, but you can dig down, in this case just a few inches below the surface, and find lots of oil.
 Now, is that a threat or isn't it?'' A year after the wreck of the Exxon Valdez, the question clings like the oil under this Perry Island beach.
 Some was soaked up by unwilling sponges: the seabirds, eagles and sea otters whose carcasses now lie frozen in five vans in an Anchorage storage yard, awaiting their day as physical evidence in court.
 Those numbers alone make the Valdez spill the most lethal ever, but scientists say the actual death count is much higher, estimating that up to 90 percent of the seabirds caught in oil sank from sight or drifted out to sea.
