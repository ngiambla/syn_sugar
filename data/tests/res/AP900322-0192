 After growth spurts of 19 percent in 1987 and 35 percent in 1988, rough diamond sales fell 2 percent to $4.09 billion last year because of slowing economies, high interest rates and the organization's two double-digit price increases in 1988 and 1989.
 Few diamond-producing countries dare sell their output outside the organization, and some bold enough to leave have returned because of the difficulty in peddling diamonds alone.
 Angola, which broke in 1985, has been negotiating its re-entry. ``We are as strongly in control of the diamond market as we have been for many years,'' said Tim Capon, the cartel's director.
 The organization buys rough diamonds from De Beers' own mines, which represent 30 percent of world production, and from producers in Tanzania, South Africa, Zaire, Botswana, Namibia, Australia and the Soviet Union.
 Oppenheimer, who linked the diamond business with his extensive Anglo American Corp. gold-mining interests, is credited with steering De Beers through the Depression.
