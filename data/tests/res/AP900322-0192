 Sales have declined sharply, and the 56-year-old cartel is facing pressure to give producers better terms and allow them to sell more of their own gems.
 De Beers' South African interests face an uncertain future, largely because of a newly energized political will by the black majority in that country, an important diamond producer.
 After growth spurts of 19 percent in 1987 and 35 percent in 1988, rough diamond sales fell 2 percent to $4.09 billion last year because of slowing economies, high interest rates and the organization's two double-digit price increases in 1988 and 1989.
 The decline was sharpest in the second half of the year, when sales fell 24 percent from the first six months. ``There was a very definite, noticeable slack in demand,'' said analyst Peter Miller of Yorkton Securities Inc. in London.
 The organization sells most of the Soviet Union's West-bound diamonds, but the Soviets, the biggest value producer, have been acting more independently and squeezing the cartel's margins, the experts say.
 The organization buys rough diamonds from De Beers' own mines, which represent 30 percent of world production, and from producers in Tanzania, South Africa, Zaire, Botswana, Namibia, Australia and the Soviet Union.
 De Beers insists it seeks long-term stability and prosperity for the industry, saying price fluctuations would undermine confidence in the value of diamonds.
 Even its fiercest competitors laud De Beers for putting up considerable amounts of money and assuming the risks to develop mines and support the market.
 Sir Ernest Oppenheimer, a diamond merchant, became chairman of De Beers in 1929 and five years later formed Diamond Trading Co., the precursor of today's cartel.
 Oppenheimer, who linked the diamond business with his extensive Anglo American Corp. gold-mining interests, is credited with steering De Beers through the Depression.
