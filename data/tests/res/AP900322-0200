 The government banned the use of sheep offal in cattle feed in June 1988, and later banned the use of cattle brain, spleen, thymus, intestines and spinal cord in food for humans.
 Earlier this month, the government announced it would pay farmers 100 percent of market value or average market price, whichever is less, for each animal diagnosed with BSE. ``I think it is a recognition _ not just of pressure from farmers _ but that the public would feel more confident that no BSE-infected animal would ever be likely to go anywhere near the food chain if there was 100 percent compensation,'' said Sir Simon Gourlay, president of the National Farmers Union.
 Similar embargoes have been imposed by Australia, Finland, Israel, Sweden, West Germany and New Zealand, according to the agriculture ministry, and the European Community has proposed a ban on exports of British cattle older than 6 months.
 David Maclean, a junior agriculture minister, has complained of ``BSE hysteria'' in the media and has insisted that the risk of the disease passing to humans is ``remote.'' The government has committed $19 million to finding the cause of the disease.
 A commission chaired by Professor Sir Richard Southwood of Oxford University reported last year that the cause of BSE ``is quite unlike any bacteria or known viruses.'' The report said the disease was impossible to detect in apparently healthy animals because it did not prompt the immune system to produce antibodies.
