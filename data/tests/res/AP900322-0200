 ``Mad cow disease'' has killed 10,000 cattle, restricted the export market for Britain's cattle industry and raised fears about the safety of eating beef.
 The government insists the disease poses only a remote risk to human health, but scientists still aren't certain what causes the disease or how it is transmitted. ``I think everyone agrees that the risks are low,'' says Martin Raff, a neurobiologist at University College, London. ``But they certainly are not zero.
 I have not changed my eating habits, but I certainly do wonder.'' Mad cow disease, or bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or BSE, was diagnosed only in 1986.
 The government banned the use of sheep offal in cattle feed in June 1988, and later banned the use of cattle brain, spleen, thymus, intestines and spinal cord in food for humans.
 Earlier this month, the government announced it would pay farmers 100 percent of market value or average market price, whichever is less, for each animal diagnosed with BSE. ``I think it is a recognition _ not just of pressure from farmers _ but that the public would feel more confident that no BSE-infected animal would ever be likely to go anywhere near the food chain if there was 100 percent compensation,'' said Sir Simon Gourlay, president of the National Farmers Union.
