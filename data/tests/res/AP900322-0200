 ``Mad cow disease'' has killed 10,000 cattle, restricted the export market for Britain's cattle industry and raised fears about the safety of eating beef.
 The symptoms are very much like scrapie, a sheep disease which has been in Britain since the 1700s.
 The suspicion is that the disease was transmitted through cattle feed, which used to contain sheep by-products as a protein supplement.
 Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service banned imports of cattle, embryos and bull semen from Great Britain in July, said Margaret Webb, a USDA spokeswoman in Washington.
 The Southwood report said it was ``most unlikely'' that the disease was a threat to humans.
