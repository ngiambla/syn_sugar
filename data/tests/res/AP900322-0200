 ``Mad cow disease'' has killed 10,000 cattle, restricted the export market for Britain's cattle industry and raised fears about the safety of eating beef.
 The government insists the disease poses only a remote risk to human health, but scientists still aren't certain what causes the disease or how it is transmitted. ``I think everyone agrees that the risks are low,'' says Martin Raff, a neurobiologist at University College, London. ``But they certainly are not zero.
 I have not changed my eating habits, but I certainly do wonder.'' Mad cow disease, or bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or BSE, was diagnosed only in 1986.
 The incurable disease eats holes in the brains of its victims; in late stages a sick animal may act skittish or stagger drunkenly.
 The government banned the use of sheep offal in cattle feed in June 1988, and later banned the use of cattle brain, spleen, thymus, intestines and spinal cord in food for humans.
