 Earlier this month, the government announced it would pay farmers 100 percent of market value or average market price, whichever is less, for each animal diagnosed with BSE. ``I think it is a recognition _ not just of pressure from farmers _ but that the public would feel more confident that no BSE-infected animal would ever be likely to go anywhere near the food chain if there was 100 percent compensation,'' said Sir Simon Gourlay, president of the National Farmers Union.
 David Maclean, a junior agriculture minister, has complained of ``BSE hysteria'' in the media and has insisted that the risk of the disease passing to humans is ``remote.'' The government has committed $19 million to finding the cause of the disease.
