 Here is a chronology of the Exxon Valdez oil spill, its cleanup and related developments: March 24: The 987-foot tanker Exxon Valdez runs aground on Bligh Reef some 25 miles south of Valdez, Alaska, spilling nearly 11 million gallons of North Slope crude oil into Prince William Sound.
 March 26: Alaska fishermen's union spokeswoman Riki Ott says the group wants full compensation for damage from the spill.
 Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan calls the spill the oil industry's ``Three Mile Island.'' Oil now covers 1,000 square miles, leaking out of the sound to foul beaches along the Gulf of Alaska and Cook Inlet.
