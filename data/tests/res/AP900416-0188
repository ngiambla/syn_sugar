 The concept is similar to the one behind the Grameen Bank of Bangladesh: channeling money to the impoverished, principally mothers, without the demands of commercial banks for collateral, so they can improve their families' lives.
 Hatch, a one-time Peace Corps volunteer with a doctorate in economic development, is founder and president of the non-profit Foundation for International Community Assistance, which recently moved its headquarters from Tucson to Alexandria, Va.
 There is ``almost a 100 percent guarantee'' that increased income for women will go into improvements in their children's welfare, Hatch says. ``We teach severely poor mothers how to create their own self-managed bank, which provides them with self-employment loans, provides them with savings incentives and provides them with a support group of mothers like themselves, so that they are all attacking change at the same time.'' Lawrence Yanovitch, small enterprise development program coordinator for Catholic Relief Services in Baltimore, Md., says, ``John Hatch is close to the voice of the poor.
 Beryl Rupp, a Rotary Club official in Phoenix, says the bank members buy necessities with their profits or savings: a chair to sit on, pots to cook in, blankets, better food.
 The foundation will go into a village with a joint-venture partner that puts up at least half of the capitalization, such as Rotary Clubs or Catholic Relief Services, and identify a key woman.
 She then contacts others to attend an organizing meeting. ``Forget the mayor, forget the priest, forget the chief,'' Hatch says. ``We want to know who the most powerful woman is in that village.'' At the meeting, the women circle illustrated examples of quick-turnover work they want the loans to finance.
 Overall, the average is 97 percent, says Hatch. ``Fifty percent or more are illiterate, and I would say 90 percent of them don't have any idea of what they're getting into when we start out,'' says Hatch. ``And yet within 16 weeks they're all experts.
