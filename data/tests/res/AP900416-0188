 He had decided he could not comply with requirements of a consulting job he had accepted from the Agency for International Development, and he was scrambling to come up with a suitable substitute. ``And on my second double bourbon at 35,000 feet up flying over the Andes, I have to say it was like this thought just rolled through my body,'' Hatch recalls. ``I had my calculator out and I was sketching this thing and I was doing numbers, and I arrived in La Paz with a full-blown concept.'' What he had stumbled upon was village banking, a system of investment using small revolving loans to poor women to finance their private enterprise, allowing them to create savings while paying interest and qualifying for bigger loans.
 There is ``almost a 100 percent guarantee'' that increased income for women will go into improvements in their children's welfare, Hatch says. ``We teach severely poor mothers how to create their own self-managed bank, which provides them with self-employment loans, provides them with savings incentives and provides them with a support group of mothers like themselves, so that they are all attacking change at the same time.'' Lawrence Yanovitch, small enterprise development program coordinator for Catholic Relief Services in Baltimore, Md., says, ``John Hatch is close to the voice of the poor.
