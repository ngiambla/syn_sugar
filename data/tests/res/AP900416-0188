 John Hatch, founder of the non-profit Foundation for International Community Assistance, promotes village banking to encourage private enterprise in the Third World.
 What he foresees is a body blow to world poverty through bootstrap economics.
 John Hatch says he hit upon his Third World ``poverty vaccination'' while panic-stricken on a flight to Bolivia.
 The series of loans, starting at $50, is renewable over three years to a ceiling of $300, allowing recipients to reach a level at which they can qualify for commercial credit.
 What Hatch envisioned on that plane five years ago has translated into 400 village banks in nine countries with more than 35,000 members.
