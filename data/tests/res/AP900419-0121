 Miss Taylor, 58, hospitalized with a sinus infection April 9 at Daniel Freeman Marina Hospital, was transferred to St.
 John's on Monday because of a persistent fever and pneumonia. ``She is currently being treated intravenously with antibiotics and will remain hospitalized,'' Dr.
 Miss Taylor said in the statement: ``I have been advised by my physician to remain hospitalized and I expect to make a full recovery.'' The actress had a nearly fatal bout of pneumonia in 1961, the year she won an Oscar for ``Butterfield 8.'' Doctors performed a tracheotomy _ inserting an air tube in her windpipe at the neck _ to help her breathe.
 Miss Taylor's health problems started with a fall from a horse when she was 13 and filming the movie ``National Velvet.'' She has had back problems ever since.
 In 1983, she acknowledged a 35-year addiction to sleeping pills and pain killers prescribed for a wide range of health problems.
