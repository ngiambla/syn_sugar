 A seriously ill Elizabeth Taylor battled pneumonia at her hospital, her breathing assisted by a ventilator, doctors say.
 Hospital officials described her condition late Monday as stabilizing after a lung biopsy to determine the cause of the pneumonia.
 Analysis of the tissue sample was expected to take until Thursday, said her spokeswoman, Chen Sam.
 She was in the intensive care unit at St.
 John's Hospital and Health Center. ``She is seriously ill,'' her doctors said in a statement. ``After surgery, her breathing is now being assisted by a ventilator.
 Her condition is presently stabilizing and her physicians are pleased with her progress.'' Another spokewoman for the actress, Lisa Del Favaro, said Miss Taylor's family was at her bedside.
 Miss Taylor entered Daniel Freeman Marina Hospital on April 9 with a persistent fever and sinus infection, doctors said.
 Her condition worsened and she was transferred April 16 to St.
 John's and moved into intensive care on Friday. ``It is serious, but they are really pleased with her progress.
 Doctors may put a patient on a ventilator simply to restore oxygen in the blood to proper levels if pneumonia-related breathing difficulties have reduced those levels, Mohler said. ``It may be that because she is such a prominent person, they are taking a conservative course,'' he added.
