(AP) </DATELINE> <TEXT> Elizabeth Taylor has rallied from a near-fatal bout with pneumonia _ and even joked about coming out in her ``balcony attire'' to wave to reporters _ but is ``not out of the woods,'' doctors say. ``I believe her life was in jeopardy over the weekend and I believe that has now passed,'' Dr.
 The 58-year-old actress was taken off the ventilator that had aided her breathing for several days and was smiling again and ``very happy the tube was out,'' said Dr.
 Patricia Murray, an infectious disease specialist. ``She said she'd come out and wave to you but she's not in her balcony attire,'' the doctor said.
