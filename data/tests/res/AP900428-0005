 With a third presidential candidate assassinated, Colombia's government refused Friday to put off next month's election and vowed to keep up the fight against drug traffickers.
 But on Thursday, within hours of Pizarro's assassination, a man had called the national radio network station Caracol and related in detail how the cartel had allegedly ordered the former guerrilla's killing.
 That is not the first time there have been contradictory communiques, verbal and faxed, claiming and and then denying responsibility for assassinations and terrorist acts.
 Leaders of the leftist Patriotic Union Party, whose candidate was slain last month, urged the government to cancel the May 27 vote.
 Hundreds of leftist guerrillas belonging to the M-19 rebel group laid down their arms last month and formed a political party with Pizarro as its presidential candidate.
 Gomez, suggesting that Barco does not have the confidence of Colombia's military, urged the president Friday to name a three-man council to run Colombia's security forces.
 The Patriotic Union's presidential candidate, Bernardo Jaramillo, was fatally wounded March 22 at the Bogota airport by an assassin with a machine gun.
 In another development, church officials in Medellin said they had foiled a plan to kill Colombia's Roman Catholic prelate, Cardinal Alfonso Lopez Trujillo.
 The city's Catholic church said it discovered the plan to kill Lopez Trujillo after intercepting messages on a radio frequency used by the men plotting the crime.
 Three men disguised as police agents entered Lopez Trujillo's offices on Wednesday and Thursday asking for the prelate, but he was not in, said the church statement late Thursday.
