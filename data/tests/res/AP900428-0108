 After the shooting of candidate Carlos Pizarro in a jetliner Thursday, the country's largest newspaper implored the government to ``do something, for the love of God.'' Addressing President Virgilio Barco, the El Tiempo editorial said: ``In your hands, and only in your hands, is the power to avoid the country's dissolution.'' ``The gravest aspect of Colombia's bloodletting is that the government has no idea how to even slow it,'' said a member of a regional human rights committee based in Medellin, the cocaine capital.
 Luis Carlos Galan of the ruling Liberal Party was gunned down last August at a political rally in Bogota, and Bernardo Jaramillo of the leftist Patriotic Union Party was killed last month at the Bogota airport.
