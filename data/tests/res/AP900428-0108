 Less than a month before elections, the assassination of a third presidential candidate has pushed Colombia to the brink of political chaos.
 Luis Carlos Galan of the ruling Liberal Party was gunned down last August at a political rally in Bogota, and Bernardo Jaramillo of the leftist Patriotic Union Party was killed last month at the Bogota airport.
 On Saturday Antonio Navarro, a longtime guerrilla leader of the April 19 Movement, announced he would take Pizarro's place as candidate for president.
 Traffickers have carried out a terrorist campaign that has killed nearly 300 Colombians in the past nine months in an effort to halt the government's campaign to capture and extradite drug barons to the United States.
 Bombings by the Medellin cartel have caused millions of dollars in property damage, led to the militarization of Medellin and other cities and shattered the nerves of citizens.
 Several politicians and analysts said an armed assassin could not have been aboard a jetliner without the complicity of government and airport security personnel.
 Official investigations have shown that certain members of the armed forces are allied with drug traffickers and the country's right-wing death squads.
 Gomez made the proposal in a written statement given to the press. ``Never has there been such a great and pathetic image of anarchy,'' said Gomez, a presidential candidate of the Conservative Party.
 Continuing to focus on a military solution to Colombia's problems, Barco said late Friday he would double the size of a 3,000-man anti-terrorist police unit.
 The unit achieved its greatest success against drug traffickers when it killed a Medellin cartel leader, Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha, in a gunfight last December.
