 Less than a month before elections, the assassination of a third presidential candidate has pushed Colombia to the brink of political chaos.
 Traffickers have carried out a terrorist campaign that has killed nearly 300 Colombians in the past nine months in an effort to halt the government's campaign to capture and extradite drug barons to the United States.
 Several politicians and analysts said an armed assassin could not have been aboard a jetliner without the complicity of government and airport security personnel.
 Official investigations have shown that certain members of the armed forces are allied with drug traffickers and the country's right-wing death squads.
 Gomez made the proposal in a written statement given to the press. ``Never has there been such a great and pathetic image of anarchy,'' said Gomez, a presidential candidate of the Conservative Party.
