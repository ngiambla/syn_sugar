 Less than a month before elections, the assassination of a third presidential candidate has pushed Colombia to the brink of political chaos.
 Several politicians and analysts said an armed assassin could not have been aboard a jetliner without the complicity of government and airport security personnel.
 Official investigations have shown that certain members of the armed forces are allied with drug traffickers and the country's right-wing death squads.
 Gomez made the proposal in a written statement given to the press. ``Never has there been such a great and pathetic image of anarchy,'' said Gomez, a presidential candidate of the Conservative Party.
 Barco, of the Liberal Party, rejected Gomez's suggestion of a triumvirate, saying the armed forces would be reorganized only if necessary.
