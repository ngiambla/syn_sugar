(AP) </DATELINE> <TEXT> Elizabeth Taylor suffered complications including new infections in her fifth week of hospitalization for pneumonia, and will remain hospitalized for about six more weeks, doctors said Friday.
 The recovery of Miss Taylor, near death two weeks ago with viral pneumonia, was dealt a setback by bacterial pneumonia and a yeast infection, her doctors said.
 That's because antibiotics are effective against bacteria but not viruses. ``She is tolerating this therapy extremely well and her doctors are pleased with her progress,'' Miss Taylor's publicist, Chen Sam, said after talking to doctors.
