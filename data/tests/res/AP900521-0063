 A 35 percent increase in tuberculosis in 1989 in Newark, N.J., has caught the attention of health officials, who had been previously recording with satisfaction a slow, steady decrease in TB cases over the last few decades.
 Hopewell and other health officials discussed the link between AIDS and TB during the a four-day World Conference on Lung Health in Boston, which ends Wednesday.
 Annik Rouillon, executive director of the International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease in Paris. ``The combination of the two is really catastrophic,'' she said.
 Snider stressed that tuberculosis, unlike AIDS, is a curable disease and called for TB screenings at drug rehabilitation programs, prisons or other places where AIDS tests are being administered.
 Snider also said doctors should administer TB tests to all persons testing positive for the HIV virus since TB may not be readily diagnosed in AIDS patients. ``It's important we get control of the situation,'' he said.
 In Wyoming, the Centers for Disease Control recorded no new cases of TB in 1989, demonstrating that it is a condition that can be controlled and cured, according to Dr.
 Reichman, director of the pulmonary division of the University of Medicine and Dentistry in New Jersey. ``I have never heard of a rise of the magnitude seen in New Jersey or, on the other hand, the hope generated by no cases in one state,'' Reichman said.
 Snider said sustained contact is necessary for TB transmission, and would not pose new problems for AIDS victims already fighting discrimination in jobs and housing.
 Reichman noted that most American have forgotten about the problems of TB; from 1981 to 1984, TB cases declined an average of 6 percent per year according to the Centers for disease control.
 But, he said, ``TB is back with a vengeance.'' While associated with poverty and crowded living conditions, TB through history has ravaged both the poor and the famous.
