 People caught by Hurricane Hugo last year might disagree, but forecasters here say the deadly storm may have had a positive side effect _ it got the public's attention.
 Hugo, which caused an unprecedented $10 billion in damage, killed 28 people in the Lesser Antilles islands and an additional 29 in South Carolina.
 At the advent of the Atlantic hurricane season, which runs from June 1 to Nov. 30, Sheets and other hurricane experts are using Hugo's example to get the attention of complacent coastal residents who've never experienced such fury. ``We'll take advantage of the fact that there was a Hugo last year and raise people's awareness,'' said Sheets. ``The consequences of not being prepared are too great.'' Early warnings about Hugo last September allowed 350,000 people to evacuate safely, and in South Carolina the worst of the hurricane struck the Francis Marion National Forest between Charleston and Myrtle Beach, Sheets said.
 He had figured the 1989 season would be relatively mild, with only four hurricanes; instead, seven hurricanes and four tropical storms killed a total of 84 people. ``He blew it pretty bad,'' Sheets said. ``But then he looked at the rainfall over Africa, and found an amazing correlation between rainfall there and hurricane activity over Florida.'' Gray realized the 30-year drought in Africa's Sahel region corresponds almost exactly to the years when no major hurricanes have struck the southeastern coast. ``Whether one causes the other is uncertain.
 Tropical storms have been recorded in the Atlantic in every month except April, but are rare outside the June 1 to Nov. 30 season.
