 People caught by Hurricane Hugo last year might disagree, but forecasters here say the deadly storm may have had a positive side effect _ it got the public's attention.
 And one forecaster says hurricane seasons may be getting worse.
 Hugo, which caused an unprecedented $10 billion in damage, killed 28 people in the Lesser Antilles islands and an additional 29 in South Carolina.
 But it would have been much more deadly if it had hit almost anywhere else, says Bob Sheets, director of the National Hurricane Center.
 It heavily damaged the fishing village of McClellanville and several small rural communities, but the population there is sparse.
