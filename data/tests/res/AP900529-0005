 At the advent of the Atlantic hurricane season, which runs from June 1 to Nov. 30, Sheets and other hurricane experts are using Hugo's example to get the attention of complacent coastal residents who've never experienced such fury. ``We'll take advantage of the fact that there was a Hugo last year and raise people's awareness,'' said Sheets. ``The consequences of not being prepared are too great.'' Early warnings about Hugo last September allowed 350,000 people to evacuate safely, and in South Carolina the worst of the hurricane struck the Francis Marion National Forest between Charleston and Myrtle Beach, Sheets said.
 With SLOSH, forecasters can predict the height of the storm surge _ the mass of water piled up by the storm that is a hurricane's most destructive component _ anywhere along the U.S. coast by punching in a storm's speed, size and intensity, Sheets said. ``The population density in South Carolina is a lot different from the Florida coast, New Jersey or Galveston, Texas,'' Sheets said. ``Compare that situation to the Miami-through-Palm Beach area _ all of Dade, Broward and Palm Beach counties would have been ... destroyed.'' Hugo was the worst hurricane to strike the southeastern U.S. coast since Betsy hit the Florida Keys in 1965, killing 74 before it went on to Missisippi and Louisiana.
