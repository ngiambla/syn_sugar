 Many coastal communities, with swelling populations, are ill-prepared to handle a hurricane emergency, said Robert Sheets, director of the National Hurricane Center.
 Some states such as Florida and Texas will experience near 200 percent growth during the period, the report said. ``What we're looking at is the possibility of greater destruction and greater loss of life,'' Sheets said Thursday. ``We can't stop the hurricanes.
 The only thing we can do is work on better preparedness and emergency planning.'' The aftermath from Hurricane Gilbert in 1988 and Hugo last year taught officials what improvements are needed to better evacuate and protect the estimated 45 million coastal residents from Maine to Texas, Sheets said. ``If the long-term trends are any indication of what's to come, we are in for more frequent and stronger hurricanes,'' said Sheets.
 Between 1940 and 1969, the United States was hit by 22 hurricanes with minimum winds of 110 mph.
 Both Gilbert and Hugo reached category 5, according to meteorologist Barry Fatchwell of the National Hurricane Center.
