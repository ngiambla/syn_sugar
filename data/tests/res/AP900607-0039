 Shining Path rebels have formed a new front to push their insurgency into Lima and other coastal urban areas, President Alan Garcia said after two powerful car bombs exploded within blocks of the Government Palace.
 Garcia spoke Wednesday in an atmosphere of stepped up rebel attacks in Lima and a series of weekend raids around the capital that resulted in the seizure of five Shining Path safe houses and 31 arrests.
 The Shining Path draws much of its support from indigenous peoples resentful of the economic and political dominance in the country of 22 million of descendants of European immigrants.
 The Shining Path has called on voters to boycott Sunday's vote and threatened election day ``armed strikes'' in Andean cities.
 Tuesday's car bomb went off behind Lima's Roman Catholic cathedral, which faces the main plaza where the Government Palace is located.
