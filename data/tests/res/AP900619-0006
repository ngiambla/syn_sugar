(AP) </DATELINE> <TEXT> 1990 is fast becoming one of the worst years on record for tornadoes and flooding across the middle and southern sections of the nation.
 So far this year, 726 tornadoes have touched down nationwide, well ahead of the 640 tornadoes recorded during the first six months of last year, and the 30-year average of 482 tornadoes recorded between January and July, said Frederick Ostby of the National Severe Storms Forecast Center here.
 The nation had 747 tornadoes in the first six months of 1973 _ one of the biggest years for tornadoes since 1950, when the forecast center began keeping reliable records of the storms.
 There were 756 tornadoes reported in 1982. ``We seem to be on a pace that would put us up with those two years,'' Ostby said.
