 1990 is fast becoming one of the worst years on record for tornadoes and flooding across the middle and southern sections of the nation.
 The culprit in this tornado barrage across the Plains is a persistent West Coast pattern of low pressure in the upper atmosphere that is keeping the jet stream anchored at a southern latitude.
 This year's storms seem particularly violent, as illustrated by the March 13 tornado that cut a swath a mile wide and brought winds of 300 mph to a field in Kansas.
 Ostby credited the quicker response to computers that allow meteorologists to see many sources of data, such as satellite readings, more clearly.
 Flooding in the South and the Plains has been as destructive as the tornadoes.
