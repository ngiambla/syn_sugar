 1990 is fast becoming one of the worst years on record for tornadoes and flooding across the middle and southern sections of the nation.
 So far this year, 726 tornadoes have touched down nationwide, well ahead of the 640 tornadoes recorded during the first six months of last year, and the 30-year average of 482 tornadoes recorded between January and July, said Frederick Ostby of the National Severe Storms Forecast Center here.
