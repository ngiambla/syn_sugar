 The republic of Slovenia plans to begin work on a constitution that will give it full sovereignty within a new Yugoslav confederation, the state Tanjug news agency reported Monday.
 Slovenia, whose 2 million inhabitants account for a fraction of Yugoslavia's total population of 23 million, is the most politically liberal and prosperous of the country's six member republics.
 Slovenia ``should be set up as a sovereign state, with all attributes of factual authority and with full international-legal rights,'' Tanjug said, quoting from a declaration of the Slovenian presidency, the top local ruling body.
 The Slovenian move was endorsed by Slovenia's president, Milan Kucan, who told a Monday session of the presidency that the new constitution will be the ``constitution of the sovereign state of Slovenia, and not of one of the federal (republics),'' Tanjug said.
