 The ``Chunnel'' between Britain and France is half-dug and scheduled to open on time in three years.
 The project also has raised increasing hostility among many Britons, who fear it will provide an easy conduit for ills from the continent ranging from terrorism to rabid animals. ``We will have the money to finish the project,'' says Alastair Morton, British deputy chairman of Eurotunnel, the privately owned Anglo-French company overseeing the work.
 While the French are forging ahead with a high-speed rail link to their end of the tunnel, for example, state-owned British Rail is dragging. ``Britain becomes branch line of Europe,'' a Guardian newspaper headline declared after the government announced June 14 that it would not fund a high-speed rail link between London and the British end of the tunnel.
 Eurotunnel Chairman Andre Benard said the company has provided for any foreseeable problems, but stressed: ``We always made it very clear that this was a risk project.'' Giant boring machines are digging three tunnels toward each other from Folkestone, England and Calais, France, with the first underground meeting expected in November in the service tunnel between the rail tunnels.
