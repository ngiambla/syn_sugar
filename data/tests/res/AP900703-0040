 There was no immediate reaction to the Slovenian declaration from federal authorities or from rival Serbia.
 Monday's parliamentary declaration provides for establishing an independent legal system that would take precedence over federal laws and for Slovenian control over armed forces stationed in the republic, state media said.
 The Ljubljana nightly television news said the declaration asked Slovenian authorities to ``assume control over units of the (Yugoslav) armed forces stationed on Slovenian territory,'' and said a 30 percent cut in defense spending would be implemented.
 A coalition of center-right parties formed a new government last month in Slovenia, the most prosperous of Yugoslavia's six republics, after trouncing reform Communists in the first free state elections held in Communist-ruled Yugoslavia in 45 years.
