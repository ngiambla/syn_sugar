 The media said a joint session of the republic's 240-seat legislature voted unanimously to adopt the Declaration of Sovereignty of the State of Slovenia.
 Slovenia contains 2 million of Yugoslavia's total population of 23 million.
 The hard-line Communist government in the largest state of Serbia vehemently opposes turning Yugoslavia into a confederation.
 The adoption of a declaration of sovereignty has been under discussion in the new Parliament since the new government was installed in May.
 Slovenia and Croatia increasingly have sided with Kosovo's ethnic Albanian majority in its drive for autonomy from Serbia.
