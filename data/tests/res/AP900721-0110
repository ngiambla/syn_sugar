 Cloudy weather Saturday threatened to mar the show for thousands of Finnish and foreign skygazers hoping to glimpse a total solar eclipse in this land of the midnight sun.
 In the eastern town of Joensuu, a television news broadcast late Saturday showed it was already cloudy there with a light drizzle falling.
 In Helsinki, the total eclipse phase will occur 16 minutes after sunrise, when the sun is only 1 degree above the horizon.
 At Joensuu, 310 miles northeast of Helsinki, the sun will be 5 degrees above the horizon in the total phase at a better angle for watchers.
 Finnair, the national airline, has arranged a dozen special flights for eclipse watchers, and private companies with small planes will provide more.
