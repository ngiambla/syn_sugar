 The weather forecast took a turn for the worse in the evening, when the Finnish Meteorological Services predicted cloudy weather with a chance of showers for eastern Finland on Sunday.
 In the eastern town of Joensuu, a television news broadcast late Saturday showed it was already cloudy there with a light drizzle falling.
 The solar eclipse in Finland starts at 4:03 a.m.
 The total eclipse begins at 4:52 a.m. in Helsinki and will last 83 seconds.
