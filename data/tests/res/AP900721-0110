 Cloudy weather Saturday threatened to mar the show for thousands of Finnish and foreign skygazers hoping to glimpse a total solar eclipse in this land of the midnight sun.
 The weather forecast took a turn for the worse in the evening, when the Finnish Meteorological Services predicted cloudy weather with a chance of showers for eastern Finland on Sunday.
 But that official, Marjut Cadia, said she had underestimated the interest in the event. ``We completely sold out the 10,000 special eyeglasses we made for this event, and our extra stock is finished too,'' she said in a television interview Saturday.
