 Nine of those killed and one of those injured were reservists with the 433rd Military Airlift Wing from Kelly Air Force Base in San Antonio.
 The 433rd had not been called to active duty, but some reservists with the wing were voluntarily participating in Operation Desert Shield after arranging time off from their civilian jobs.
 The plane was from the 60th Military Airlift Squadron from Travis Air Force Base in California and was en route to Rhein-Mein Air Base near Frankfurt, authorities said.
 The West German Defense Ministry said in a statement Wednesday the crash posed no danger to the operation.
 Air Force base in Europe, is 90 miles west of Frankfurt.
 The C-5 is the largest transport plane in the Air Force fleet and costs about $148 million.
