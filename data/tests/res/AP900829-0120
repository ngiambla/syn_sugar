 The crash early Wednesday of the huge C-5A transport was the first major accident in the nearly 3-week-old, round-the-clock deployment of U.S. personnel and equipment to the gulf. ``I don't want to speculate on the cause of this mishap,'' said Brig.
 Richard Swope of the 316th Air Division. ``We don't have any indication as to what the cause of the accident was.'' Four of the 17 people aboard the cargo plane were injured when the massive aircraft tumbled into a field early Wednesday after taking off from Ramstein Air Base, a stopover for many U.S. military flights bound for the gulf region.
