 Nine of those killed and one of those injured were reservists with the 433rd Military Airlift Wing from Kelly Air Force Base in San Antonio.
 The four others were stationed at Ramstein or at nearby Hahn Air Base.

 The four were hospitalized and reported in satisfactory condition, said Sgt.
 The 433rd had not been called to active duty, but some reservists with the wing were voluntarily participating in Operation Desert Shield after arranging time off from their civilian jobs.
 The plane was from the 60th Military Airlift Squadron from Travis Air Force Base in California and was en route to Rhein-Mein Air Base near Frankfurt, authorities said.
 It left the Ramstein air base at about 12:30 a.m. and clipped the tops of trees before crashing and breaking apart.
 The accident occurred about six miles from Miesau, where U.S. military authorities have been removing a cache of chemical weapons under an agreement with the West German government.
 The C-5 is the largest transport plane in the Air Force fleet and costs about $148 million.
