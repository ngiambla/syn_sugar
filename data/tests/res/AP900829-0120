 Nine reservists helping in the U.S. military buildup in the Persian Gulf were among the 13 people killed in the crash of U.S. military cargo plane in West Germany, military authorities said Wednesday.
 The plane was bound for Frankfurt carrying medical supplies, food and aircraft maintenance equipment for U.S. troops sent to Saudi Arabia following the Aug. 2 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, U.S.
 Nine of those killed and one of those injured were reservists with the 433rd Military Airlift Wing from Kelly Air Force Base in San Antonio.
 The four others were stationed at Ramstein or at nearby Hahn Air Base.
 The 433rd had not been called to active duty, but some reservists with the wing were voluntarily participating in Operation Desert Shield after arranging time off from their civilian jobs.
 The plane was from the 60th Military Airlift Squadron from Travis Air Force Base in California and was en route to Rhein-Mein Air Base near Frankfurt, authorities said.
 It left the Ramstein air base at about 12:30 a.m. and clipped the tops of trees before crashing and breaking apart.
 The accident occurred about six miles from Miesau, where U.S. military authorities have been removing a cache of chemical weapons under an agreement with the West German government.
 The West German Defense Ministry said in a statement Wednesday the crash posed no danger to the operation.
 The C-5 is the largest transport plane in the Air Force fleet and costs about $148 million.
