 The crash early Wednesday of the huge C-5A transport was the first major accident in the nearly 3-week-old, round-the-clock deployment of U.S. personnel and equipment to the gulf. ``I don't want to speculate on the cause of this mishap,'' said Brig.
 The plane was bound for Frankfurt carrying medical supplies, food and aircraft maintenance equipment for U.S. troops sent to Saudi Arabia following the Aug. 2 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, U.S.
 Air Force officials said.
 Late Wednesday, the Air Force released the names of the victims.
 Nine of those killed and one of those injured were reservists with the 433rd Military Airlift Wing from Kelly Air Force Base in San Antonio.
 The four others were stationed at Ramstein or at nearby Hahn Air Base.

 The four were hospitalized and reported in satisfactory condition, said Sgt.
 The plane was from the 60th Military Airlift Squadron from Travis Air Force Base in California and was en route to Rhein-Mein Air Base near Frankfurt, authorities said.
 It left the Ramstein air base at about 12:30 a.m. and clipped the tops of trees before crashing and breaking apart.
 The C-5 is the largest transport plane in the Air Force fleet and costs about $148 million.
