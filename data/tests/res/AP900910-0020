 Two years ago, it looked as if a vast part of the nation's farm empire was burning up as drought and heat parched crops and livestock.
 But the 1988 drought wasn't as bad as it might have been, according to an Agriculture Department analysis.
 It concentrated on the most severe drought region, centered in nine states of the Midwest and upper Great Plains.
 All of the information used in the study was from USDA's annual Farm Costs and Returns Survey, which includes detailed income and expense information derived from personal interviews of farm operators.
 It also includes allowances for changes in the value of inventories and adjustments for depreciation and other factors. _Despite drought, farms in all areas of the country continued to improve their solvency position in 1988. _The number of farms considered financially vulnerable continued to decrease in 1988 in both the drought and non-drought regions. _Farms in the drought region received lower direct government payments in 1988, despite an infusion of federal disaster relief. _The average farm in the drought region survived financially by selling off inventories and taking advantage of higher commodity market prices to redeem price support loans made by USDA's Commodity Credit Corp.
