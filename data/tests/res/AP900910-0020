 Two years ago, it looked as if a vast part of the nation's farm empire was burning up as drought and heat parched crops and livestock.
 Crop yields plummeted, but commodity prices rose.
 Basic findings: _Net farm income decreased in 1988 in the drought region to an average of $28,899 per farm from $38,122 in 1987.
 It also includes allowances for changes in the value of inventories and adjustments for depreciation and other factors. _Despite drought, farms in all areas of the country continued to improve their solvency position in 1988. _The number of farms considered financially vulnerable continued to decrease in 1988 in both the drought and non-drought regions. _Farms in the drought region received lower direct government payments in 1988, despite an infusion of federal disaster relief. _The average farm in the drought region survived financially by selling off inventories and taking advantage of higher commodity market prices to redeem price support loans made by USDA's Commodity Credit Corp.
 In the drought states, 62.2 percent of the farms were said to be in favorable financial position, compared with 62.8 percent in 1987. ``Even with lower incomes, farmers in the drought region continued to improve their debt position (in relation to assets),'' the report said. ``A major factor in their improvement was the continued upward trend in land values.'' The report noted that higher market prices helped reduce the direct payments to farmers in 1988 under USDA's commodity programs.
