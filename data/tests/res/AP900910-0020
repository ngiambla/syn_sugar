 Two years ago, it looked as if a vast part of the nation's farm empire was burning up as drought and heat parched crops and livestock.
 All of the information used in the study was from USDA's annual Farm Costs and Returns Survey, which includes detailed income and expense information derived from personal interviews of farm operators.
 Basic findings: _Net farm income decreased in 1988 in the drought region to an average of $28,899 per farm from $38,122 in 1987.
 As used by the agency, net farm income includes gross income from farming during the calendar year, including federal payments, minus costs of production.
 It also includes allowances for changes in the value of inventories and adjustments for depreciation and other factors. _Despite drought, farms in all areas of the country continued to improve their solvency position in 1988. _The number of farms considered financially vulnerable continued to decrease in 1988 in both the drought and non-drought regions. _Farms in the drought region received lower direct government payments in 1988, despite an infusion of federal disaster relief. _The average farm in the drought region survived financially by selling off inventories and taking advantage of higher commodity market prices to redeem price support loans made by USDA's Commodity Credit Corp.
 In the category of net farm income, the report said the share of farms in a ``favorable financial position'' in 1988 held fairly steady at 68 percent in the non-drought region, compared with 69.1 percent in 1987.
 The Agriculture Department says inspectors are on guard against items that can carry Boophilus ticks into the United States. ``This tick, which carries bovine babesiosis _ a serious cattle disease often called Texas cattle fever _ was eradicated from the United States in 1943,'' said James W.
 Hides that have been tanned or soaked in a saltwater solution with mineral acid, and dry antlers can be imported from Mexico without restriction, provided they are certified to be of Mexican origin.
 The Agriculture Department is using tiny wheat fields of one square foot each to monitor the spread of leaf and stem rust in the Southeast.
 John Roberts, a scientist in the department's Agricultural Research Service, said the tiny plots are planted in July about 20 miles apart along an interstate highway route through Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Louisiana and Mississippi, then looping back into Georgia.
