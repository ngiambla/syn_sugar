 Air Force F-111 fighter-bomber crashed today in Saudi Arabia, killing both crew members, U.S. military officials reported.
 It was the fourth American aircraft to crash in three days among those deployed to this kingdom for Operation Desert Shield.
 Eight Marines are missing in the crash of two helicopters in the northern Arabian Sea on Monday.
 An Air Force F-4 reconnaissance jet also went down that day, killing both crew members.
 J.D. van Sickle, a military spokesman, said the F-111 crashed in the ``southern Arabian peninsula'' while on a training mission and that the incident was under investigation.
