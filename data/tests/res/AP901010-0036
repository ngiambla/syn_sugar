 Air Force F-111 fighter-bomber crashed today in Saudi Arabia, killing both crew members, U.S. military officials reported.
 It was the fourth American aircraft to crash in three days among those deployed to this kingdom for Operation Desert Shield.
 Eight Marines are missing in the crash of two helicopters in the northern Arabian Sea on Monday.
 An Air Force F-4 reconnaissance jet also went down that day, killing both crew members.
 The aircraft was attached the 48th Tactical Fighter Wing based at RAF Lakenheath Air Base in Britain.
 The wing was sent to Turkey as U.S. forces massed in the region in response to Iraq's Aug. 2 takeover of Kuwait.
 Today's crash brought to at least nine the number of Americans killed in the Persian Gulf region since Operation Desert Shield began.
 In addition to those killed in Saudi Arabia, 13 other Air Force personnel were killed in a crash of a C-5 jet cargo plane in Germany.
