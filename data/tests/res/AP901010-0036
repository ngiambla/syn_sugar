 Eight Marines are missing in the crash of two helicopters in the northern Arabian Sea on Monday.
 J.D. van Sickle, a military spokesman, said the F-111 crashed in the ``southern Arabian peninsula'' while on a training mission and that the incident was under investigation.
 The aircraft was attached the 48th Tactical Fighter Wing based at RAF Lakenheath Air Base in Britain.
 The wing was sent to Turkey as U.S. forces massed in the region in response to Iraq's Aug. 2 takeover of Kuwait.
 In addition to those killed in Saudi Arabia, 13 other Air Force personnel were killed in a crash of a C-5 jet cargo plane in Germany.
