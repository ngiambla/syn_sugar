 Eight Marines are missing in the crash of two helicopters in the northern Arabian Sea on Monday.
 The aircraft was attached the 48th Tactical Fighter Wing based at RAF Lakenheath Air Base in Britain.
 The wing was sent to Turkey as U.S. forces massed in the region in response to Iraq's Aug. 2 takeover of Kuwait.
 Officials said the F-111 crashed at dawn.
