 Air Force F-111 fighter-bomber crashed today in Saudi Arabia, killing both crew members, U.S. military officials reported.
 Eight Marines are missing in the crash of two helicopters in the northern Arabian Sea on Monday.
 The aircraft was attached the 48th Tactical Fighter Wing based at RAF Lakenheath Air Base in Britain.
 The wing was sent to Turkey as U.S. forces massed in the region in response to Iraq's Aug. 2 takeover of Kuwait.
 In addition to those killed in Saudi Arabia, 13 other Air Force personnel were killed in a crash of a C-5 jet cargo plane in Germany.
 The F-model has more powerful engines, and state-of-the-art equipment to operate against enemy targets at night.
