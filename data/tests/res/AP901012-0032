 At the Pentagon, spokesman Pete Williams said the number of U.S. aircraft accidents in the gulf - including three separate crashes this week - were not out of the ordinary.
 Desert Shield, the largest U.S. military buildup since the Vietnam War, involves an estimated 700 Air Force combat and support aircraft.
 The toll for accidental deaths since Operation Desert Shield began rose to 31 on Wednesday when an Air Force F-111 fighter-bomber crashed on a training mission in Saudi Arabia, killing both crew members.
 Williams said the Air Force was the only service that has taken special measures to review safety in the gulf since this week's accidents. ``They're concerned about the accidents, they're concerned about the number of accidents that happened so quickly over a short period of time,'' he told reporters.
 Five U.S. aircraft have been involved in fatal crashes in the gulf area since the start of Desert Shield two months ago: an F-111, an F-4 Phantom reconnaissance jet, an F-15E and two Marine Corps UH-1 Huey helicopters.
