 The government said Iraqi agents or Egyptian Moslem fundamentalists were to blame for the assassination Friday of its second-highest official, Rifaat el-Mahgoub.
 He was the first Egyptian politician assassinated since Islamic extremists shot President Anwar Sadat at a military parade nine years ago.
 Mubarak, wearing a black suit and sunglasses, and British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd, on a two-day official visit, were in the front row of about 1,000 mourners.
