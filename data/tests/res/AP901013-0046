 Speaker Eds: LEADS with 13 grafs to UPDATE with funeral, sixth person dies.
 Pickup 10th pvs, `Saddam has...' Egypt honored its slain parliament speaker and four security men today with a state funeral led by a grim-looking President Hosni Mubarak.
 The government said Iraqi agents or Egyptian Moslem fundamentalists were to blame for the assassination Friday of its second-highest official, Rifaat el-Mahgoub.
 He was the first Egyptian politician assassinated since Islamic extremists shot President Anwar Sadat at a military parade nine years ago.
 The death toll from the attack rose to six today with the death of the speaker's chauffeur.
 Doctors in a Cairo hospital said the driver suffered bullet wounds in the stomach, back and arm.
 Hassan Abu-Basha, a former police minister, told the Cairo newspaper Al-Ahram he believed el-Mahgoub's slaying was the work of Iraqi agents.
 Hundreds of red-bereted military police and white-uniformed policemen sealed off all streets leading to the mosque where the religious service was held.
 Mubarak, wearing a black suit and sunglasses, and British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd, on a two-day official visit, were in the front row of about 1,000 mourners.
