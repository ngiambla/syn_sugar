 Egypt honored its slain parliament speaker and four security men today with a state funeral led by a grim-looking President Hosni Mubarak.
 He was the first Egyptian politician assassinated since Islamic extremists shot President Anwar Sadat at a military parade nine years ago.
 Hundreds of red-bereted military police and white-uniformed policemen sealed off all streets leading to the mosque where the religious service was held.
 Behind them were four military jeeps carrying coffins of the four security men, draped in the red, white and black Egyptian flag.
 The state-owned newspaper Al-Ahram, quoting police sources, reported Monday that local Moslem extremists were collaborating with Palestinian terrorists sent to the country by Iraq on sabotage missions.
