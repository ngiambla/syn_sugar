 Egypt honored its slain parliament speaker and four security men today with a state funeral led by a grim-looking President Hosni Mubarak.
 The government said Iraqi agents or Egyptian Moslem fundamentalists were to blame for the assassination Friday of its second-highest official, Rifaat el-Mahgoub.
 He was the first Egyptian politician assassinated since Islamic extremists shot President Anwar Sadat at a military parade nine years ago.
 Hassan Abu-Basha, a former police minister, told the Cairo newspaper Al-Ahram he believed el-Mahgoub's slaying was the work of Iraqi agents.
 Mubarak, wearing a black suit and sunglasses, and British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd, on a two-day official visit, were in the front row of about 1,000 mourners.
