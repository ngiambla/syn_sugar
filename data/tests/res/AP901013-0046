 Egypt honored its slain parliament speaker and four security men today with a state funeral led by a grim-looking President Hosni Mubarak.
 The government said Iraqi agents or Egyptian Moslem fundamentalists were to blame for the assassination Friday of its second-highest official, Rifaat el-Mahgoub.
 He was the first Egyptian politician assassinated since Islamic extremists shot President Anwar Sadat at a military parade nine years ago.
 Hundreds of red-bereted military police and white-uniformed policemen sealed off all streets leading to the mosque where the religious service was held.
 Mubarak, wearing a black suit and sunglasses, and British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd, on a two-day official visit, were in the front row of about 1,000 mourners.
 Behind them were four military jeeps carrying coffins of the four security men, draped in the red, white and black Egyptian flag.
