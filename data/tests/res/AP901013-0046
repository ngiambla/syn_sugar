 Egypt honored its slain parliament speaker and four security men today with a state funeral led by a grim-looking President Hosni Mubarak.
 The government said Iraqi agents or Egyptian Moslem fundamentalists were to blame for the assassination Friday of its second-highest official, Rifaat el-Mahgoub.
 He was the first Egyptian politician assassinated since Islamic extremists shot President Anwar Sadat at a military parade nine years ago.
