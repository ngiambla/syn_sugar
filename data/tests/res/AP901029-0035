 Barnes, 24, was shot between the eyes in his apartment.
 Police said an officer investigating a report of a prowler had entered the apartment at 3:30 a.m. and fired after Barnes got out of bed to see what was wrong.
 It was the seventh shooting death involving Kansas City police officers this year.
 In the previous three years, five people were shot and killed. ``I just hope that this case will draw the line on where the police can kill an innocent man.
 Barnes was white, as is the officer who shot him; however, other recent incidents of alleged excessive force involved black citizens.
