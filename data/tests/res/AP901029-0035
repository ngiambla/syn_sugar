 Barnes, 24, was shot between the eyes in his apartment.
 It was the seventh shooting death involving Kansas City police officers this year.
 Barnes was white, as is the officer who shot him; however, other recent incidents of alleged excessive force involved black citizens.
 Two police officers, whose names were not disclosed, noticed the door to his apartment was not tightly shut and entered, authorities said.
 Friends of Barnes questioned whether his apartment door was ajar and whether he would have lunged at the officer. ``We are defending the officers being in that apartment,'' Mills said. ``As for the shooting itself, we will make no assessment of the propriety of that until after the investigation.'' The department has suffered a string of complaints about excessive force and racism since the spring.
