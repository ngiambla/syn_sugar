 Police said an officer investigating a report of a prowler had entered the apartment at 3:30 a.m. and fired after Barnes got out of bed to see what was wrong.
 Barnes was white, as is the officer who shot him; however, other recent incidents of alleged excessive force involved black citizens.
 Two police officers, whose names were not disclosed, noticed the door to his apartment was not tightly shut and entered, authorities said.
 Barnes made ``a kind of lunging motion,'' and the officer fired from about 5 to 8 feet, Mills said.
 Friends of Barnes questioned whether his apartment door was ajar and whether he would have lunged at the officer. ``We are defending the officers being in that apartment,'' Mills said. ``As for the shooting itself, we will make no assessment of the propriety of that until after the investigation.'' The department has suffered a string of complaints about excessive force and racism since the spring.
 He was placed on paid leave pending a police investigation and that of a grand jury. ``This is a tragic chain of events that is regrettable for Mr.
 Barnes' family and for this officer,'' Bishop said. ``The officers were reacting appropriately to a number of circumstances which together led them to that apartment.'' ``Terry was a good man.
