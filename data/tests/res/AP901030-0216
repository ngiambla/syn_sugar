 Britain and France were linked beneath the English Channel on Tuesday when workers used a two-inch probe to connect two halves of a 31-mile undersea rail tunnel, officials reported.
 That time is comparable to flying, if transport to and from airports is included, and is half the time of a car-ferry journey.
 The conservative Daily Express newspaper noted in its Wednesday editions that Britons would theoretically be able to walk to France for the first time since the last Ice Age.
 The cost of the project has soared from an initial estimate of $9.4 billion to $16.7 billion, including an extra $1.97 billion for unforeseen cost overruns.
 The threading of the probes through 100 yards of chalk under the English Channel marks a major turning point in three years of drilling on the world's costliest tunnel.
 A study released last Friday in Paris by transportation experts said the tunnel's completion will aggravate traffic congestion in a wide area of continental Europe.
