 By CHRISTOPHE DeCROIX Associated Press Writer CALAIS, France (AP) Britain and France were linked beneath the English Channel on Tuesday when workers used a two-inch probe to connect two halves of a 31-mile undersea rail tunnel, officials reported.
 Management sources at TransManche Link, the construction consortium building the ``Chunnel'' - the Channel Tunnel - confirmed the historic linkup occurred about 8:25 p.m. when British workers sent the probe through to French colleagues. ``It is an example of what Europe is about,'' British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said in London. ``This is Europe in practice.'' The linkup fulfills a dream by Napoleon in 1802, who thought he could defeat the English by connecting Britain to Europe with a land passage.
 The Chunnel is scheduled for completion in June 1993. ``This is a hugely historic moment because it means, in effect, that Britain is no longer an island,'' said a construction union official.
