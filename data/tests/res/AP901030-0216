 The basic goal of the Channel Tunnel project is to enable passengers to travel between London and Paris in about three hours.
 The cost of the project has soared from an initial estimate of $9.4 billion to $16.7 billion, including an extra $1.97 billion for unforeseen cost overruns.
 The threading of the probes through 100 yards of chalk under the English Channel marks a major turning point in three years of drilling on the world's costliest tunnel.
 The first coupling of the two rail tunnels is scheduled for mid-1991.
 More than 200 banks are involved in the financing.
