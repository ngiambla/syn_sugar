 Britain and France were linked beneath the English Channel on Tuesday when workers used a two-inch probe to connect two halves of a 31-mile undersea rail tunnel, officials reported.
 The basic goal of the Channel Tunnel project is to enable passengers to travel between London and Paris in about three hours.
 That time is comparable to flying, if transport to and from airports is included, and is half the time of a car-ferry journey.
 The cost of the project has soared from an initial estimate of $9.4 billion to $16.7 billion, including an extra $1.97 billion for unforeseen cost overruns.
 The meeting point was just over 13{ miles southeast of Shakespeare Cliff, the British terminus near the town of Dover, and 10 miles northwest of the French town of Sangatte, near Calais.
