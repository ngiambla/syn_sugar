 Threading a spinning probe the width of a garden hose through 100 yards of chalk under the Channel bears the first tangible fruit in three years of drilling.
 Champagne corks popped and workers danced jigs after French drillers phoned news of the probe's arrival to their British counterparts.
 Technicians will be more certain Wednesday, but they called the rough line-up ``exceptional.'' The workers will now bore out a one-yard hole.
 The tunneling machine on the French side will then guide itself by laser toward the British machine, ensuring perfect alignment.
 Eight workers suffered injures, two seriously, about 90 minutes after Tuesday's linkup when a tractor rolled over on them in a service gallery, authorities in nearby Sangatte reported.
 Since the tunnel construction began in 1987 there have been seven accidental deaths on the British side and two on the French side.
 The tunnel's cost has soared from an initial estimate of $9.4 billion to $16.7 billion, including an extra $1.97 billion in case of unforeseen cost overruns.
 The tunnels were joined 13{ miles southeast of Folkestone, England, the British terminus near Dover, and 10 miles northwest of Sangatte, near Calais.
 Militant workers on the French side are striking for more pay and began a work slowdown Thursday, threatening to stall the link-up.
 The three-hour Paris-to-London trip would be comparable to flying, if transport to and from airports is included, and is half the time of the present car-ferry journey.
