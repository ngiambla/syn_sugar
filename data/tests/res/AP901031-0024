 Workmen tunneling under the English Channel have created the first land link between Britain and the Continent, connecting 31 miles of tunnel in a prodigious feat of engineering and finance.
 Tuesday when British workers sent a probe 2 inches in diameter through to their French colleagues.
 Linking England and France, the tunnel symbolizes the growing unification of Europe.
 It also fulfills a dream of Napoleon, who wanted to send his armies through the tunnel to conquer Britain.
