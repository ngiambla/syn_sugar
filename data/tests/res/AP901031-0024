 The tunneling machine on the French side will then guide itself by laser toward the British machine, ensuring perfect alignment.
 Since the tunnel construction began in 1987 there have been seven accidental deaths on the British side and two on the French side.

 Militant workers on the French side are striking for more pay and began a work slowdown Thursday, threatening to stall the link-up.
