 Eight workers suffered injures, two seriously, about 90 minutes after Tuesday's linkup when a tractor rolled over on them in a service gallery, authorities in nearby Sangatte reported.
 Since the tunnel construction began in 1987 there have been seven accidental deaths on the British side and two on the French side.
 The tunnels were joined 13{ miles southeast of Folkestone, England, the British terminus near Dover, and 10 miles northwest of Sangatte, near Calais.
 Militant workers on the French side are striking for more pay and began a work slowdown Thursday, threatening to stall the link-up.
 The three-hour Paris-to-London trip would be comparable to flying, if transport to and from airports is included, and is half the time of the present car-ferry journey.
