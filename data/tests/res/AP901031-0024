 TransManche Link, the construction consortium building the ``Chunnel'' said the historic linkup occurred at 8:25 p.m.
 Tuesday when British workers sent a probe 2 inches in diameter through to their French colleagues.
 Linking England and France, the tunnel symbolizes the growing unification of Europe.
 Eurotunnel PLC, the Anglo-French consortium overseeing the world's largest engineering project, plans for high-speed trains to pass through the Channel Tunnel in June 1993.
 Despite her countrymen's fears of losing their ancient moat against Europe, British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher described the breakthrough as ``a very exciting moment.'' ``It is an example of what Europe is about,'' she said in London. ``This is Europe in practice.'' In London, the conservative Daily Express newspaper noted today that Britons will be able to walk to France for the first time since the Ice Age. ``This is a hugely historic moment because it means, in effect, that Britain is no longer an island,'' a construction union official in Calais said.
