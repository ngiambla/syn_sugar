 The 1990 Atlantic hurricane season had more storms than usual and some forecasters predict that's just a hint of more frequent and more forceful hurricanes in the coming years.

 Some meteorological experts think the rainfall signaled the end of a 20-year drought - and may have spawned Gilbert in 1988 and Hugo in 1989.
