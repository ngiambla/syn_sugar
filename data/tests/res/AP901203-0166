(AP) </DATELINE> <TEXT> At least four moderate earthquakes rattled parts of the world, but there was nary a tremor Monday along the New Madrid Fault, where a scientist said a earthquake was likely to occur. ``This is just a normal day,'' said Waverly Person, chief of the U.S.
 Geological Survey's National Earthquake Information Center. ``We're not backing the prediction at all.'' Along the New Madrid Fault, some schools were canceled and residents purchased earthquake emergency kits and others left town, just in case climatologist Iben Browning was right.
 Geological Survey for more than 25 years. ``There are no two earthquakes alike.'' The center received more than 50 calls about the New Madrid forecast Monday morning and hundreds last week, said Person, who began doing interviews for radio and television stations just after midnight.
 That's where they conduct those tests.'' A few minutes later, the needle jumped again. ``That's not a test,'' he said. ``That's a quake.'' With a measured eye, he estimated the quake was magnitude 2.5 to 3.0 on the Richter scale.
