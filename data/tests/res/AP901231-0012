 By TALLI NAUMAN Associated Press Writer MEXICO CITY (AP) Mexico, where sun worship has passed from ancient civilizations to modern beachgoers, is gearing up early for the day next year when the sun will be blotted out.
 President Carlos Salinas de Gortari has appointed a Cabinet-level commission to prepare for what astronomers bill as ``the slar eclipse of the century'' on July 11.
 Posters have been placed in Mexico City subways promoting the event, and resorts along the eclipse's path are scrambling to accommodate the expected rush of tourists. ``It's the most important eclipse in history,'' says Miguel Gil Guzman, secretary-general of the Mexican Astronomical Society.
 This one will cut a swath across one of the most populous regions of the globe, turning day to night for an estimated 50 million residents in 14 of Mexico's 31 states.
 The 165-mile-wide path will go dark for almost seven minutes, the maximum length for a total solar eclipse.
 On July 11, the moon will pass between the planet and the sun, abruptly swallowing midday's light, except for a weird glow on the horizon.
 Baja California Sur alone plans to spend $26.5 million for public safety for eclipse enthusiasts but banks on raking in millions more from tourism.
