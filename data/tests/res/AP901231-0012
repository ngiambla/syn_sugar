 Mexico, where sun worship has passed from ancient civilizations to modern beachgoers, is gearing up early for the day next year when the sun will be blotted out.
 President Carlos Salinas de Gortari has appointed a Cabinet-level commission to prepare for what astronomers bill as ``the slar eclipse of the century'' on July 11.
 Posters have been placed in Mexico City subways promoting the event, and resorts along the eclipse's path are scrambling to accommodate the expected rush of tourists. ``It's the most important eclipse in history,'' says Miguel Gil Guzman, secretary-general of the Mexican Astronomical Society.
 The 165-mile-wide path will go dark for almost seven minutes, the maximum length for a total solar eclipse.
 On July 11, the moon will pass between the planet and the sun, abruptly swallowing midday's light, except for a weird glow on the horizon.
 The commission bills the northwestern state of Baja California Sur as the best place to watch because the state has an average of 300 cloudless days a year.
 Baja California Sur's tourist facilities can only handle 120,000 visitors, and 90 percent of that capacity is booked, tourism director Rodolfo Palacios says.
 Some 13,500 amateur and professional astronomers from the United States, Japan, Soviet Union, China, Canada, England, France and Germany have confirmed reservations.
 The moon is 400 times smaller than the sun, but because it is 400 times closer to the earth, the smaller body appears to cover the larger one.
 The National University is developing six half-hour documentaries on eclipses and 10 TV spots on the dangers of looking at the sun, astronomy professor Jesus Galindo says.
