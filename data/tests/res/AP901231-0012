 Mexico, where sun worship has passed from ancient civilizations to modern beachgoers, is gearing up early for the day next year when the sun will be blotted out.
 President Carlos Salinas de Gortari has appointed a Cabinet-level commission to prepare for what astronomers bill as ``the slar eclipse of the century'' on July 11.
 The 165-mile-wide path will go dark for almost seven minutes, the maximum length for a total solar eclipse.
 On July 11, the moon will pass between the planet and the sun, abruptly swallowing midday's light, except for a weird glow on the horizon.
 But the special government commission, Eclipse 1991, is banking on the clouds to roll in the country's financial favor.
 The commission bills the northwestern state of Baja California Sur as the best place to watch because the state has an average of 300 cloudless days a year.
 The National University is developing six half-hour documentaries on eclipses and 10 TV spots on the dangers of looking at the sun, astronomy professor Jesus Galindo says.
