 Scientists at London zoo have discovered that a strain of "mad cow disease" affecting a type of antelope can be transmitted much more easily than was thought.
 The finding uncovers a threat to breeding other species in captivity unless it can be shown that they are not equally vulnerable.
 It has also been found in domestic cats and their larger relations, the cheetah and the puma, in eland and nyala, and in the gemsbok and the Arabian oryx.
 Sheep are believed to catch the disease by contact with placentas in fields after births, but in the case of the kudu even this route seems unlikely.
 It is more likely, the scientists believe, that an unidentified agent entered the herd in contaminated feed and was passed along, as with more mundane infections.
