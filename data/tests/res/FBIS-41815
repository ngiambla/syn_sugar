 The zoo's small herd of kudu, spiral-horned antelopes closely related to cows, has been severely hit by a disease similar to bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE).
 It has also been found in domestic cats and their larger relations, the cheetah and the puma, in eland and nyala, and in the gemsbok and the Arabian oryx.
