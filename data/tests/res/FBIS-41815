 The finding uncovers a threat to breeding other species in captivity unless it can be shown that they are not equally vulnerable.
 Only one of the five could have eaten feed containing protein from sheep, believed to be the origin of the outbreak.
 It has also been found in domestic cats and their larger relations, the cheetah and the puma, in eland and nyala, and in the gemsbok and the Arabian oryx.
 The infective agent and its mode of transmission are unknown, but the evidence from kudu suggests that some species may be more easily infected than others.
 The scientists say that the next step must be to examine whether the agent causing the disease in kudu is the same as that in cows.
