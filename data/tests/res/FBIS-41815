 Scientists at London zoo have discovered that a strain of "mad cow disease" affecting a type of antelope can be transmitted much more easily than was thought.
 The finding uncovers a threat to breeding other species in captivity unless it can be shown that they are not equally vulnerable.
 It has also been found in domestic cats and their larger relations, the cheetah and the puma, in eland and nyala, and in the gemsbok and the Arabian oryx.
 The infective agent and its mode of transmission are unknown, but the evidence from kudu suggests that some species may be more easily infected than others.
 Sheep are believed to catch the disease by contact with placentas in fields after births, but in the case of the kudu even this route seems unlikely.
 Nor can at least three of the affected animals have caught the disease from their mothers, who did not suffer from it.
 It is more likely, the scientists believe, that an unidentified agent entered the herd in contaminated feed and was passed along, as with more mundane infections.
 Another danger taken seriously by the zoo, a world centre for breeding rare and endangered species, is that animals bred in captivity could carry the infection when released into the wild.
 The scientists say that the next step must be to examine whether the agent causing the disease in kudu is the same as that in cows.
 If, however, it turned out to be a different and more easily transmittable form, the case for isolating the kudu would be even stronger.
