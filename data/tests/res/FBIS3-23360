 Confirmed information indicates that in early 1994, IMYO elements held an important meeting in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, with officials from the FRC.
 The information adds that the IMYO made several decisions to attack Jordanian interests and institutions and assassinate Jordanian diplomats in a move to pressure the Jordanian regime.
 The information says that the scheme was designed some two years ago and the Muslim Brotherhood Movement in Jordan refused to get involved in it because of the danger and because the Brotherhood Movement does not agree with the proposals of other fundamentalist organizations.
 The FRC (Abu-Nidal group) took immediate steps after al- Ma'ayitah's assassination.
 It is worth noting that the Jordanian intelligence service played an important role in revealing the secrets and details of al- Ma'ayitah's assassination.
