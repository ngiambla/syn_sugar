 The paper claimed that the "anonymous sources" who supplied the "secret" document provided "full authentication" and that "experts" consulted by the paper also "agreed" that the document was the handiwork of imprisoned Shining Path leader Abimael Guzman (La Republica, 26 January).(See Note 1) (Note 1) La Republica did not assert that the document was actually signed by Guzman.
 La Republica's publication of the Shining Path strategy statement follows by three months the October 1993 release by the Fujimori government of letters from Guzman calling for peace talks with the government (Radio Programs del Peru, 1 October 1993; Radio and TV, 4 October 1993; Global de Television, 10 October 1993; Panamericana Television, 30 October 1993).
 Thee analyst concluded, therefore, that the insurgents' peace strategy represents "an ideological reaffirmation of Guzman's leadership" and "recognition that circumstances have changed." (Note 3) For example, in his presentation of the video recording of Guzman's first call for peace talks, Fujimori claimed that the Shining Path "political" leadership "has tacitly admitted that the Peruvian state has totally recovered the initiative in confronting the Shining Path" (Lima Radio and TV, 4 October 1993).
 Outlook La Republica's assessment of the Shining Path peace strategy document may quiet doubts about whether earlier letters calling for peace talks actually represented the views of top leaders.
 BOX Media Doubts over Earlier Shining Path Peace Letters -- Following the first Guzman letter calling for peace talks, announced by Fujimori at thee United Nations last October (Radio Programas del Peru, 1 October 1993), the conservative daily El Comercio reported that one seasoned political observer had warned" that Guzman's "reported" desire "to reach a peace agreement" does not mean there is reason "to claim a victory in the ongoing struggle against terrorism" since, according to the observer, the imprisoned insurgent leader may no longer control the Shining Path (2 October 1993). -- Following the second Guzman letter, which supplemented the call for peace talks with what seemed to be praise for Fujimori's economic and political program (Lima Global de Television, 1O October 1993), a commentator for the anti-Fujimori weekly Caretas wrote that the government was using a "broken" Guzman "in the campaign for the 'yes' vote" for the upcoming referendum, adding that "it is no coincidence that the letters . . . have come out during the 3O days prior" to the 31 October vote (14 October 1993). -- Responding similarly to the second Guzman letter, an editorial in La Republica wondered whether "government representatives," working to promote the "yes" vote on the referendum, had not "fallen into a trap" by thinking that Shining Path militants would take seriously such an "unctuous" call for peace talks as appeared in the letter (14 October 1993). -- Also in response to the second letter, Caretas on 14 October claimed that Fujimori was "using" Guzman "in the campaign" to win the 31 October referendum, noting that "with Guzman's letters" calling for peace talks, Fujimori's "promise" to wipe out the Shining Path by 1995 "may gain credibility."
