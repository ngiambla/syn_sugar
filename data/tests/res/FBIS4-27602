 Seoul, May 30 (YONHAP) -- The joint military-prosecution investigation team, which probed the assassination of President Pak Chong-hui by then Central Intelligence Agency Director Kim Chae-kyu in October 1979, had found no evidence that then Army Chief of Staff and martial law commander, Gen.
 Paek Tong-nim, 57, who served as chief investigator of the Defense Security Command and concurrently as a key member of the joint investigating team, told the prosecution that no concrete evidence of Chong's involvement had been detected in the course of probing the assassin Kim, according to a spokesman for the Seoul District Public Prosecutor's Office.
 The joint investigation headquarters' announcement on Dec. 24, 1979, charging Chong with high treason was based not on any concrete evidence but on what he did after after Kim killed Pak on the night of Oct. 26, 1979, Paek was quoted as saying.
 Paek dismissed as "not true" then Defense Minister No Chae-hyon's statement on Dec. 13, 1979, that martial Law Commander Chong was arrested for interrogation because new evidence was discovered in the course of investigating the assassination.
 The joint probe team felt the need to question Chong because when Kim killed Pak he was nearby and Prosecutor Chong Kyong-sik, a member of the joint team, called on the martial law commander at his office three times to question him about his actions on the assassination day, Paek was quoted as saying.
