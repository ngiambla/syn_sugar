 The Seoul District Public Prosecutor's Office is looking into a criminal suit filed by the victims of the Dec. 12 "coup d'etat-like incident of the Army" against the perpetrators, including former Presidents Chon Tu-hwan and No Tae-u.
 Paek dismissed as "not true" then Defense Minister No Chae-hyon's statement on Dec. 13, 1979, that martial Law Commander Chong was arrested for interrogation because new evidence was discovered in the course of investigating the assassination.
 The joint probe team felt the need to question Chong because when Kim killed Pak he was nearby and Prosecutor Chong Kyong-sik, a member of the joint team, called on the martial law commander at his office three times to question him about his actions on the assassination day, Paek was quoted as saying.
