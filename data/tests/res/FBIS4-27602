 The joint investigation headquarters' announcement on Dec. 24, 1979, charging Chong with high treason was based not on any concrete evidence but on what he did after after Kim killed Pak on the night of Oct. 26, 1979, Paek was quoted as saying.
 Paek dismissed as "not true" then Defense Minister No Chae-hyon's statement on Dec. 13, 1979, that martial Law Commander Chong was arrested for interrogation because new evidence was discovered in the course of investigating the assassination.
