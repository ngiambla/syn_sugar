 Seoul, May 30 (YONHAP) -- The joint military-prosecution investigation team, which probed the assassination of President Pak Chong-hui by then Central Intelligence Agency Director Kim Chae-kyu in October 1979, had found no evidence that then Army Chief of Staff and martial law commander, Gen.
 The joint investigation headquarters' announcement on Dec. 24, 1979, charging Chong with high treason was based not on any concrete evidence but on what he did after after Kim killed Pak on the night of Oct. 26, 1979, Paek was quoted as saying.
 Paek dismissed as "not true" then Defense Minister No Chae-hyon's statement on Dec. 13, 1979, that martial Law Commander Chong was arrested for interrogation because new evidence was discovered in the course of investigating the assassination.
 Chon Tu-hwan forcibly arrested Chong, seemingly because of the headquarters' "political motive," suggesting that the Dec. 12 incident was a mutiny by the "new military elite" to topple the government.
 The prosecution is considering summoning lawyer Won Kang-hui, who as military prosecutor indicted Chong Sung-hwa on charges of abetting high treason, for questioning.
