 Based on the conclusions of the Third Plenum and the Working Meeting, the Central Committee, during the meeting in February presided over by "Feliciano," reasserted "the principle of revolutionary violence as a universal law expressed in the people's war."

Intelligence agents believe that the most likely targets are "financial companies, banks, stores, and industries, in order to sow confusion among local and foreign investors." Other likely targets are "soon-to-be-privatized public energy and mining companies, the embassies of countries whose citizens are purchasing Peruvian companies, and the interests that these countries already have in Peru.
