 FBIS4-56863 "drlat090_r_94006" FBIS-LAT-94-090 Daily Report 28 Apr 1994 Peru Shining Path To Continue `People's War' Shining Path To Continue `People's War' PY0905222294 Lima LA REPUBLICA in Spanish 28 Apr 94 pp 19-21 PY0905222294 Lima LA REPUBLICA Spanish BFN ["Exclusive" report by Angel Paez] [Text] The Shining Path Central Committee, comprised of leaders who have still not been arrested and alternate members elected by the Shining Path congress in 1988, held a meeting in February that was presided over by Oscar Ramirez Durand, a.k.a. "Comrade Feliciano." During the meeting, the Shining Path Central Committee decided to continue the "people's war" and to consider those members who uphold the peace accord with the government to be removed from the party "by their own free will." The document entitled "To Grow Strong on the Grounds of Partisan Unity and Conquer Power" [Reafirmarse en la Base de Unidad Partidaria y Construir la Conquesta del Power], which contains the conclusions of the Shining Path event, criticizes the leaders under arrest who try to convince the militants still operating to "uphold the great decision and definition," that is, Abimael Guzman's appeal for the Shining Path to end hostilities against the Peruvian state.
 A Shining Path pamphlet dated February, which is signed by the leaders under arrest, asserts that "the people's war has ended, and (therefore) to continue refusing to uphold (the "great decision and definition") means obstructing the Peace Accord and placing the life of President Gonzalo and other comrades at stake." But the Central Committee meeting in February disqualified the arrested leaders, stating that "it is an international communist rule that no leader can lead (the party or a war) from prison." According to the Maoist theory, a militant who is in prison loses his operational capacity when he is isolated from reality, and therefore is assigned another type of job.
