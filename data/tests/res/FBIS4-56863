 To reassert the three strategies: the political strategy: to conquer power; the military strategy: the people's war, to develop the war of movements and promote arrangements for the uprising of cities; and the construction strategy: to make arrangements to conquer power in the midst of the people's war.
 Based on the conclusions of the Third Plenum and the Working Meeting, the Central Committee, during the meeting in February presided over by "Feliciano," reasserted "the principle of revolutionary violence as a universal law expressed in the people's war." The third point discussed during the Central Committee meeting headed by "Feliciano" referred to the militants who uphold the peace accord.
 Furthermore: 5. "Actions that go against principles cannot be accepted" because "it is an international communist rule that the leadership (of the party and the war) cannot be exercised from prison," and because "monstrosities like the `peace accord'(...) clash with our principles." The Central Committee meeting that "Feliciano" presided over clearly defined its position toward Abimael Guzman Reinoso, whose ideological contribution to the people's war, called "Gonzalo's Thoughts," was acknowledged.
 Under the guise of defending the party, they are undermining it and its leadership so as to bring about its defeat, by using empty rhetoric to disguise their partisan, opportunistic, and personal interests and ambitions, and by taking a blind, biased, subjective, and superficial approach to concrete reality. (...) We urge the eradication of these leftist ideas of military extraction." The communique emphasized the decision to put an end to the people's war: "The people's war is over.
 Such actions must be prevented to the extent possible, and immediately and categorically criticized." Meanwhile, the Central Committee has acknowledged "Gonzalo's Thoughts" as the ideological basis for the "people's war," Guzman Reinoso's "leadership" and his inability to lead the party and the war from prison, and has decided to reorganize the Shining Path machine to launch a new stage of the war without Guzman.
