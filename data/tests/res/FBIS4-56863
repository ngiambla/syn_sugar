"Comrade Feliciano." During the meeting, the Shining Path Central Committee decided to continue the "people's war" and to consider those members who uphold the peace accord with the government to be removed from the party "by their own free will." The document entitled "To Grow Strong on the Grounds of Partisan Unity and Conquer Power" [Reafirmarse en la Base de Unidad Partidaria y Construir la Conquesta del Power], which contains the conclusions of the Shining Path event, criticizes the leaders under arrest who try to convince the militants still operating to "uphold the great decision and definition," that is, Abimael Guzman's appeal for the Shining Path to end hostilities against the Peruvian state.
 The document addresses this aspect of the internal debate as: "About the Struggle Against the Counterrevolutionary Hoax and the Black Group that upholds a Right-Wing Opportunist Line (LOD)." In order to confront the Black Group or LOD, which are nothing but Shining Path militants who sign Abimael Guzman's letters and uphold his "great decision and definition" to negotiate with the government in order to end the war, the Central Committee demands that the militants "grow stronger on the Basis for Partisan Unity [Base de Unidad Partidaria, BUP]," which is the Shining Path basic principles adopted during the 1988 Congress, and "arrange for conquering power in the midst of the people's war." The Central Committee Plenum that "Feliciano" presided over in order to break away from the Black Group orders the "unleashing of a massive reassertion movement based on the BUP throughout the party, the People's Liberation Army, and among the masses of the New Power." The Central Committee uses several arguments to "urge the smashing of the counterrevolutionary nonsense and the misbegotten schemes of Yankee imperialism, the genocidal and traitorous dictatorship, and the Black Group:" 1.
