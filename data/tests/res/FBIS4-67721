 In comparison with 1992, tuberculosis morbidity has increased by 14.8%, and mortality -- by 44%.
 The total number of tuberculosis cases in 1993 was 868, while in the 1992 -- it was 771.
 Inta Pavlovska, director of the data processing and registry division of the State Tuberculosis and Lung Disease Center informed DIENA that the increase in tuberculosis morbidity could be related to the poor socioeconomic conditions in the nation, as well as shortcomings in the legislative process.
