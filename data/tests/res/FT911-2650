 As bankers and finance ministers gathered in Washington this weekend for the spring meetings of the bank and International Monetary Fund, there was no shortage of advice.
 The US Treasury wants the bank to bypass the governments of developing countries and lend sizeable sums directly to the private sector.
 The bank is also under pressure to follow the example of Mr Jacques Attali's European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) and attach strict political conditions to its loans.
 Mr Preston may relax on one count.
 Few in Washington now doubt that the bank is needed: new imperatives, such as reconstruction in eastern Europe and the Middle East, have merely been superimposed on older, unsolved problems: Grinding poverty is a near universal condition in much of the world: 1bn people live on less than Dollars 1 a day.
