 The bank is also under pressure to follow the example of Mr Jacques Attali's European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) and attach strict political conditions to its loans.
 For a decade the bank has effectively been run by two senior - and strong-willed - vice-presidents: Mr Ernest Stern (who nearly left last year to join the EBRD) and Mr Moeen Qureshi.
 Mr Feinberg at the Overseas Development Council broadly agrees: the bank has got to find a way of 'melding equity and efficiency as it promotes development'.
 The challenge for Mr Preston is clear: put the sterile ideological battles of the 1980s behind the bank and develop policies that put greater emphasis on the formation of human capital.
 Mr Summers, the bank's economist, says pessimistically that because development money will be in short supply over the next decade, the bank and other donors will have to concentrate on exporting ideas.
