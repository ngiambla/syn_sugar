 That is the vexing question facing Mr Lewis Preston, the former chairman of J P Morgan, the New York bank, who takes over as president of the World Bank this September.
 As bankers and finance ministers gathered in Washington this weekend for the spring meetings of the bank and International Monetary Fund, there was no shortage of advice.
 Mr Preston's first challenge, says Mr Mistry, will be to wrest control of the bank from Messrs Stern and Qureshi; his second, to prune legions of 'useless advisers' and install managers with real-world experience.
 On average programmes have reduced balance of payments gaps, had a negligible impact on Gross National Product and led to falls in the ratio of investment to GNP.
 Mr Feinberg calls the decline in investment the 'great shortcoming of structural adjustment lending in the 1980s'. (Investment to GNP ratios have fallen markedly in Africa, the Middle East and Latin America.) He says the bank was naive to expect entrepreneurs to respond to the austerity of adjustment by increasing investment.
 The World Bank operates under very different rules: its charter requires it to be non-political and only its small affiliate, the International Finance Corporation (IFC), can make direct loans to private businesses.
 In reality, much of the most badly-needed investment is in spheres such as infrastructure, health care and education where governments play a dominant role even in industrialised countries.
 Mr Feinberg at the Overseas Development Council broadly agrees: the bank has got to find a way of 'melding equity and efficiency as it promotes development'.
 The challenge for Mr Preston is clear: put the sterile ideological battles of the 1980s behind the bank and develop policies that put greater emphasis on the formation of human capital.
 Mr Summers, the bank's economist, says pessimistically that because development money will be in short supply over the next decade, the bank and other donors will have to concentrate on exporting ideas.
