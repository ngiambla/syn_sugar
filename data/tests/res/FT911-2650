 _AN-BD2BCABOFT 910429 FT 29 APR 91 / Challenge to foster human capital: As bankers and finance ministers gather in Washington, the World Bank looks for fresh vigour under a new chief By MICHAEL PROWSE How can 6,000 civil servants, mostly based in Washington, best promote development in the Third World?
 As bankers and finance ministers gathered in Washington this weekend for the spring meetings of the bank and International Monetary Fund, there was no shortage of advice.
 The US Treasury wants the bank to bypass the governments of developing countries and lend sizeable sums directly to the private sector.
 The bank is also under pressure to follow the example of Mr Jacques Attali's European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) and attach strict political conditions to its loans.
 Development economists, meanwhile, are urging the bank to respect the rhetoric of last year's World Development Report and focus more on poverty alleviation.
 Few in Washington now doubt that the bank is needed: new imperatives, such as reconstruction in eastern Europe and the Middle East, have merely been superimposed on older, unsolved problems: Grinding poverty is a near universal condition in much of the world: 1bn people live on less than Dollars 1 a day.
 For a decade the bank has effectively been run by two senior - and strong-willed - vice-presidents: Mr Ernest Stern (who nearly left last year to join the EBRD) and Mr Moeen Qureshi.
 The result of delay and compound interest is a total debt burden today of some Dollars 1,341bn compared with a relatively manageable Dollars 639bn in 1980. 'The bank failed to take a timely leadership position on the debt crisis,' concludes Mr Richard Feinberg, director of the Overseas Development Council in Washington. (The IMF was equally short-sighted.) As incoming president, Mr Preston must review the bank's strategies for promoting development.
