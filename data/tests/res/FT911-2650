 How can 6,000 civil servants, mostly based in Washington, best promote development in the Third World?
 As bankers and finance ministers gathered in Washington this weekend for the spring meetings of the bank and International Monetary Fund, there was no shortage of advice.
 The US Treasury wants the bank to bypass the governments of developing countries and lend sizeable sums directly to the private sector.
 The bank is also under pressure to follow the example of Mr Jacques Attali's European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) and attach strict political conditions to its loans.
 Development economists, meanwhile, are urging the bank to respect the rhetoric of last year's World Development Report and focus more on poverty alleviation.
