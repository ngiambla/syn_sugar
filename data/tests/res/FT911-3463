 De Beers is resisting any change.
 It acknowledges that all sectors of the diamond trade welcomed the CSO's efforts to keep the diamond market stable.
 The Botswana government recently set up a diamond cutting centre with De Beers' technical help, and this, too, should further the country's understanding of the market.
 Analysts suggest market conditions do not help Botswana press its case.
 Prices of rough diamonds, with few exceptions, have moved upwards every year since the 1930s depression.
