 SLOVENIA'S economic prospects would improve significantly if it could settle its relations with the former National Bank of Yugoslavia (NBY), or central bank, establish new relations with foreign creditors as rapidly as possible, and join the International Monetary Fund and World Bank.
 Before Slovenia declared independence, any foreign exchange deposits which Slovene citizens deposited in banks in Slovenia were transferred to the NBY.
 In addition, Croatian citizens in neighbouring Croatia also deposited Dollars 465m into Slovene banks in Croatia.
 Officials at the the Ljubljanska Bank, Slovenia's largest bank into which the majority of the foreign exchange accounts were originally deposited, are hoping that the the government of Slovenia will guarantee these debts and open up negotiations with the NBY for the eventual return of the deposits.
 Mr Marko Kranjec, vice-governor of the Bank of Slovenia, or central bank, reckons Slovenes will have to wait years before they can obtain their foreign exchange savings.
