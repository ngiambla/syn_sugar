 SLOVENIA'S economic prospects would improve significantly if it could settle its relations with the former National Bank of Yugoslavia (NBY), or central bank, establish new relations with foreign creditors as rapidly as possible, and join the International Monetary Fund and World Bank.
 Officials at the the Ljubljanska Bank, Slovenia's largest bank into which the majority of the foreign exchange accounts were originally deposited, are hoping that the the government of Slovenia will guarantee these debts and open up negotiations with the NBY for the eventual return of the deposits.
 Mr Marko Kranjec, vice-governor of the Bank of Slovenia, or central bank, reckons Slovenes will have to wait years before they can obtain their foreign exchange savings.
 Of this amount, Slovenia accepts that its allocated share of that debt is Dollars 1.8bn. 'We will not renege on repaying this debt,' said Mr Andrej Klemencic, adviser to Slovenia's Ministry of Finance.
 Mr Jose Mencinger, a member of the board of Slovenia's central bank, said servicing that debt should not be a problem. 'Last year, our exports totalled Dollars 3.8bn.
 The unallocated federal debt - which consists of loans to the NBY, or the federal government which had not been specifically earmarked for projects in any of the six republics of the former Yugoslavia - amounts to Dollars 3.5bn.
 Mr Kranjec says that the Bank of Slovenia has already proposed negotiations on this issue, as well as trying to discuss the status of the NBY'S foreign exchange reserves, the clearing balances with the countries of the former CMEA socialist trading organisation, and operations of banks. 'This is going to take a long time to settle,' said Mr Kranjec.
 He and other Slovene economists now believe that the European Community-sponsored peace conference on Yugoslavia could play a role in negotiating issues related to the debt.
