 SLOVENIA'S economic prospects would improve significantly if it could settle its relations with the former National Bank of Yugoslavia (NBY), or central bank, establish new relations with foreign creditors as rapidly as possible, and join the International Monetary Fund and World Bank.
 Mr Jose Mencinger, a member of the board of Slovenia's central bank, said servicing that debt should not be a problem. 'Last year, our exports totalled Dollars 3.8bn.
 Mr Kranjec says that the Bank of Slovenia has already proposed negotiations on this issue, as well as trying to discuss the status of the NBY'S foreign exchange reserves, the clearing balances with the countries of the former CMEA socialist trading organisation, and operations of banks. 'This is going to take a long time to settle,' said Mr Kranjec.
