 THE CONDITION known in cattle as 'mad cow disease', spongiform encephalopathies, has been found in Britain's sparsely-scattered antelope population, the government has admitted.
 The statistics - released in response to a written question from Mr Ron Davies, a Labour agriculture spokesman - show a disconcertingly rapid increase in the number of sheep found to have the disease.
 However, the government states in a footnote to the table that the reporting of scrapie in sheep has been encouraged since 1991 'to obtain material for spongiform encephalopathy research'.
 Mr David Maclean, junior agriculture minister, stressed that naturally occurring spongiform encephalopathies in species other than cattle were not notifiable diseases.
 He said there was 'insufficient epidemiological data' to 'draw firm conclusions' as to how the disease might have been contracted in cases other than scrapie.
