 LOS ANGELES Police Chief Daryl Gates had been accused of nurturing one of the most brutal police forces in the country: now he is under attack for fuelling the violence and then standing by as it rolled across poor black neighbourhoods.
 Mr Gates acknowledged yesterday that his department had been overwhelmed by the scale of the violence.
 Police could only look on, outnumbered, as crowds looted shops, and moved in mostly to protect firefighters from attack.
 The controversial police chief was said to have argued on Wednesday, the first night of rioting, against sending in National Guard troops, and only to have bowed later to evidence that his police force was incapable of handling the violence.
 In March, Mr Gates strongly defended the detective who had led an investigation 17 years earlier into the killing of an off-duty Los Angeles police officer, although a judge had just released the two men wrongfully convicted, calling police conduct 'reprehensible' and urging an immediate investigation of the 'sordid record'.
