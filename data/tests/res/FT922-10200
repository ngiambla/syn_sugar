 LOS ANGELES Police Chief Daryl Gates had been accused of nurturing one of the most brutal police forces in the country: now he is under attack for fuelling the violence and then standing by as it rolled across poor black neighbourhoods.
 Mr Gates acknowledged yesterday that his department had been overwhelmed by the scale of the violence.
 In his 14 years of office, his critics say he has built a heavily politicised force in his own image: aggressive, insensitive and widely tinged with racism.
 But the Los Angeles police chief has almost complete protection from removal under a 1937 statute that followed a series of political scandals, and Mr Gates has developed political clout on top of this job security.
 A high-ranking commission appointed after the beating, under the chairmanship of Mr Warren Christopher, a lawyer and former deputy secretary of state, concluded that the Los Angeles police department got results, in terms of arrests, but had developed a 'siege mentality that alienates the officer from the community'.
