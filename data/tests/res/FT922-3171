 JUST weeks ago, the prospects for the North American free trade agreement seemed assured.
 The proposed pact between the US, Canada and Mexico had the support of the Republican establishment, of Governor Bill Clinton, the prospective Democratic nominee, of the powerful Texas Democrats on Capitol Hill and most of the Democratic leadership in Congress.

 His campaign for the presidency is stressing jobs, and he has said a Nafta pact would send jobs to Mexico.
 The White House has taken its own polls and remains convinced that President Bush's support for Nafta is a winning issue.
