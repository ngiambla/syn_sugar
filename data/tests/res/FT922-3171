 JUST weeks ago, the prospects for the North American free trade agreement seemed assured.
 Between retirements and election defeats, one-quarter to a one-third of the House could change, and no one can foresee the prevailing sentiment on trade issues.
 The president is expected to stage a high profile initialing of the agreement at the most politically opportune time.
 Politically sophisticated trade lobbyists, like Mr Harry Freeman, executive director of the MTN Coalition, believes the Democrats will use Nafta as a weapon against the president, arguing that he wants to divert jobs to Mexico.
 The environment/farm/ labour coalition opposed to the Nafta has prepared its ground well in the House.
