 His campaign for the presidency is stressing jobs, and he has said a Nafta pact would send jobs to Mexico.
 The White House has taken its own polls and remains convinced that President Bush's support for Nafta is a winning issue.
 Under the tightly constrained fast-track procedure - which forces Congress to vote on a trade pact without amendment - it is too late to get Nafta approved by Congress this year.
 Between retirements and election defeats, one-quarter to a one-third of the House could change, and no one can foresee the prevailing sentiment on trade issues.
 Politically sophisticated trade lobbyists, like Mr Harry Freeman, executive director of the MTN Coalition, believes the Democrats will use Nafta as a weapon against the president, arguing that he wants to divert jobs to Mexico.
