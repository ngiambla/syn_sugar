 THE war in the former republics of Yugoslavia is forcing Slovene enterprises to find alternative trading partners among European Community countries as a means of compensating for lost markets in the region.
 Until 1990, over 30 per cent of Slovenia's exports were with the former Yugoslavia, while about 70 per cent were divided between Comecon, the now defunct socialist trading block, and western European countries.
 But following an embargo by Serbia on Slovene imports in 1990, and ensuing war in neighbouring Croatia last year, Slovene exports to the former Yugoslavia have fallen to 15 per cent of that previously.
 In the meantime, Slovene enterprises, particularly those in the furniture, electronics, paper, and white goods sector, are exporting to European Community countries.
 Last year, total exports of goods reached Dollars 3.9bn, and imports, Dollars 4.1bn. 'Our enterprises are beginning to find new markets,' said Mr Horvath, adding that Germany, Italy, France and Austria are now Slovenia's main trading partners.
