 THE World Bank will link loan volume to the strength of a country's efforts to fight poverty, according to an operational directive to staff issued today by Mr Lewis Preston, the bank's president.
 The directive signals an attempt to impose a form of 'social conditionality' on borrowing countries. 'Stronger government commitment to poverty reduction warrants greater support; conversely, weaker commitment to poverty reduction warrants less support,' it says.
