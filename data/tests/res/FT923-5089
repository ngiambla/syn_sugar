 FT923-5089 _AN-CIEAPAA8FT 920903 FT 03 SEP 92 / Bush calls on power to dispense largesse: Hurricane's aid to the president By JUREK MARTIN and NIKKI TAIT THERE are growing signs that Hurricane Andrew, unwelcome as it was for the devastated inhabitants of Florida and Louisiana, may in the end do no harm to the re-election campaign of President George Bush.
 After a faltering and heavily criticised initial response to the disaster, both the president and his administration seem finally to be getting assistance to those rendered homeless and to businesses and farms that have been destroyed.
 In the process, Mr Bush has been able to call on the power of incumbency, the one asset denied his presidential rival, Mr Bill Clinton, who is to visit Florida today.
