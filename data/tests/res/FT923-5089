 This was brought home graphically by the president's announcement that Homestead Air Force base in Florida - a major local employer virtually destroyed by Andrew - would be rebuilt.
 It was only his tenth such televised speech from the Oval Office, itself a testimony to the gravity of the situation.
 However, the arrival in Florida of the military and the assignment of special responsibilities to Mr Andrew Card, the young and telegenic transportation secretary, is making a difference.
 Also increasingly evident is the hand of Mr James Baker, now ensconced at the White House.
 It is also Mr Baker who is making the most of presidential powers to dispense largesse.
