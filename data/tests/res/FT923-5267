 US INSURERS expect to pay out an estimated Dollars 7.3bn (Pounds 3.7bn) in Florida as a result of Hurricane Andrew - by far the costliest disaster the industry has ever faced.
 It is reckoned the bulk of the damage - over Dollars 6bn in insured claims - is in Dade County, a rural region to the south of Miami.
 By contrast, insurance claims resulting from the Los Angeles riots earlier this year - the most expensive civil disturbance in the US - totalled just Dollars 775m.
 The LA riots and a series of tornadoes, wind and hailstorms in states such as Kansas, Oklahoma and Iowa had already produced insured losses of Dollars 3.9bn.
 This easily exceeds the record Dollars 7.6bn of catastrophe losses seen in 1989, when the industry paid out on both Hurricane Hugo and the Loma Prieta earthquake in California.
