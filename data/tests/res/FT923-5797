 SQUADS of workers fanned out across storm-battered Louisiana yesterday to begin a massive rebuilding effort after Hurricane Andrew had flattened whole districts, killing two people and injuring dozens more, agencies report from Florida and New Orleans.
 The government estimated it would cost Dollars 20bn-Dollars 30bn to tidy and rebuild in Florida, and to care for residents displaced by the storm.
 The Federal Emergency Management Agency said it was setting aside Dollars 77m to help Louisiana recover.
 Andrew had become little more than a strong rainstorm early yesterday, moving across Mississippi state and heading for the north-eastern US.
 Several of Louisiana's main industries were affected, including those of oysters and alligators.
