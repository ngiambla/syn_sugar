 _AN-CIBBCAA1FT 920828 FT 28 AUG 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Oppenheimer to visit Moscow as diamond shake-up looms By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent MR HARRY Oppenheimer, whose family effectively controls the Anglo American Corporation of South Africa and De Beers, is to visit Russia next week at a time when the republic is considering a big shake-up in its diamond industry.
 De Beers said yesterday that the visit by Mr Oppenheimer, accompanied by his son Nicholas, was a private one originally arranged for August last year but postponed because of the coup d'etat in the former Soviet Union.
