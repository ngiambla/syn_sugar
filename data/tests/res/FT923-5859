 MR HARRY Oppenheimer, whose family effectively controls the Anglo American Corporation of South Africa and De Beers, is to visit Russia next week at a time when the republic is considering a big shake-up in its diamond industry.
 His visit also comes at a time when the beleaguered diamond industry is rife with rumours about unofficial exports from Russia contributing to the present market turmoil which might force De Beers to cut its dividend payment this year.
 Some industry observers suggest that the presence in Russia of Mr Oppenheimer, who will be 84 in October, will be timely. 'It appears to be another sign that the former De Beers' chairman is taking a more active role in guiding the company through its current difficulties,' says the Diamantaire newsletter today.
 De Beers' London-based Central Selling Organisation, which controls about 80 per cent of world trade in rough (uncut) diamonds, in 1990 signed a Dollars 5bn, five-year sales contract with the former Soviet Union and at the same time advanced a loan of Dollars 1bn.
 After the break-up of the Soviet Union the contract was continued with Rosalmazzoloto, the Russian gold and diamond organisation, and an exclusive sales agreement was later signed with Yukutia, the area in eastern Siberia where most Russian diamonds are mined and which is now an autonomous republic in the Russian Federation.
