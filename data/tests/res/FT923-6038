 The storm, which brought havoc to southern Florida on Monday and then headed north-west across the Gulf of Mexico, had made landfall late on Tuesday night some 60 miles south-west of the city in the agricultural Cajun country.
 By yesterday afternoon, it had been down-graded to tropical storm, in that its sustained windspeeds were below 75 mph.
 The Lloyd's member, in close contact with leading insurers in Florida, said that damage to insured property was remarkably small.
