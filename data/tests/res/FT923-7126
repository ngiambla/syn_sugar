 IT IS ironic that there is an unprecedented, greedy rush for diamonds by miners in Angola and Canada precisely at a time when the diamond business is in turmoil and questions are inevitably being asked about the ability of the world's most successful cartel to keep its tight grip on the market.
 Stakers are using helicopters because each claim area is so large and prospectors have claimed every piece of land within 300 km (185 miles) of the discovery.
 In spite of all this hectic activity, it is very unlikely that anyone will find enough big diamonds to make the development of Canada's first diamond mine worthwhile.
 The odds in favour of making a fortune are much better for the diamond hunters in Angola.
 What is also remarkable is that all those scrambling for diamonds in Angola or dropping out of the skies to stake expensive claims in Canada take it for granted that the diamond cartel will be able to continue to keep prices up and make all their efforts worthwhile.
