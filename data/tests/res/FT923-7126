 The cartel is organised by De Beers' London-based Central Selling Organisation, which markets about 80 per cent of the world's rough diamonds.
 It has also told the producers to cut deliveries by 25 per cent - something the CSO contracts permit at times of stress.
 De Beers releases a controlled stream of rough diamonds to the market through 'sights' offered by the CSO ten times a year to about 160 selected buyers.
 Diamond prices cannot be fixed artificially but have to be set at a level which allows production and consumption to be equated. 'What the CSO for many years has done successfully, is to operate a buffer pool, stocking diamonds in bad times and liquidating its stocks when demand is in excess of the level of supply.
 To cool the market, the CSO imposed swingeing price increases: 13.5 per cent in May 1988 and 15.5 per cent in March 1989.
