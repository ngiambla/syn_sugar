 De Beers probably knows the answers because its intelligence network is remarkable.
 The cartel is organised by De Beers' London-based Central Selling Organisation, which markets about 80 per cent of the world's rough diamonds.
 Apart from De Beers' own production from Namibia and South Africa, the CSO handles rough gem diamonds from Angola, Australia, Botswana, Russia, Tanzania and Zaire.
 Buyers have either to accept all the diamonds or reject the box.
 The fact is that the level of world diamond production, which is carried on in many countries, cannot be controlled.
