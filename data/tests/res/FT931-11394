 He told the National Governors' Association that he was committed to 'ending welfare as we know it' with measures to finance expanded job training for the unemployed, matched by a requirement that people must do some kind of work for their welfare cheque.
 The president said he would focus on better implementation of the Family Support Act, a 1988 welfare reform based on the work of an NGA task-force which he, as governor of Arkansas, co-chaired. 'The bill that is on the books will work, given the right economy and the right support systems,' Mr Clinton said.
 Advocates of welfare reform had been discouraged about the new administration's intentions, fearing that the centrist Democratic emphasis on requiring welfare recipients to work or enroll for training might fall prey to left-wing advocacy groups concentrating on greater funding of existing programmes.
 These suspicions were enhanced when Ms Donna Shalala, new secretary of health and human services, last month devoted only one sentence to welfare reform in a five-page statement of goals.
 But at the same time people must be helped out of the welfare trap by providing them with continued health coverage, child care, and expanded earned income tax credits when they took jobs.
