 PRESIDENT Bill Clinton yesterday promised to name a task-force within the next 10 days to reform the US social safety net of welfare programmes.
 The president said he would focus on better implementation of the Family Support Act, a 1988 welfare reform based on the work of an NGA task-force which he, as governor of Arkansas, co-chaired. 'The bill that is on the books will work, given the right economy and the right support systems,' Mr Clinton said.
 These suspicions were enhanced when Ms Donna Shalala, new secretary of health and human services, last month devoted only one sentence to welfare reform in a five-page statement of goals.
 As a result, few states have been able to implement in full the act's requirement that welfare recipients take part in some form of education or training.
 Mr Clinton promised yesterday his reforms would be based on the principle that 'welfare should be a second chance, not a way of life'.
