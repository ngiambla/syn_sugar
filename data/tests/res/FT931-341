 FT931-341 _AN-DC3CGAGRFT 930330 FT 30 MAR 93 / Survey of the Republic of Slovenia (1): The Balkans' lucky ones - Though the country has suffered economically from the disintegration of Yugoslavia and the war in the Balkans, independence has given its 2m inhabitants the opportunity to build an open market economy and democratic institutions By ANTHONY ROBINSON SLOVENES always had at least as much in common with their Alpine neighbours as with their Balkan partners in the former Yugoslavia.
