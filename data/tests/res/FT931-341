 Austria is insulated from the war-torn regions of Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina, both once ruled by the Austrian Habs- burgs, thanks to its own 324 km-long border with Slovenia.
 The new Karavanke road tunnel beneath the Alps, completed just before the 10-day war between Slovenia and the Yugoslav army which immediately followed indep- endence, has underlined Slovenia's traditional importance as a transit route.
 The railways and the motorway leading south through the capital Ljubljana to the Slovenian port of Koper and its Italian neighbour Trieste carry freight and travellers heading to and from central Europe and the Adriatic sea.
 Independence has, above all, brought peace to Slovenia and left it free to implement the kind of rational market reforms and privatisation policies which remain blocked in the republics absorbed and impoverished by war further south.
 But a mixture of compassion for the suffering of their fellow southern Slavs and economic loss ensures that the Slovene authorities, while categorically ruling out any possibility of resuming old political ties with former Yugoslavia, pray, without much hope, for a quick and lasting solution to the conflict and the resumption of normal economic ties.
 The war, with its violent and deliberate displacement of millions of people, has and is taking place in the ethnically mixed border lands of Croatia and Bosnia relatively distant from the Slovene border.
