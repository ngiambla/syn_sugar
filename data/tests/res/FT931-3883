 GOVERNMENT veterinary and health experts were yesterday putting out reassuring messages about bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), or 'mad cow' disease, in the face of growing public anxiety.
 Farmers reported 8,581 animals with BSE during the first nine weeks of this year compared with 8,099 in the same period last year.
 It was revealed this week that Mr Peter Warhurst, a dairy farmer whose herd had a BSE case in 1989, died last year of Creutzfeld-Jacob disease.
 Statistical analysis, taking account of the average national incidence of CJD and the number of people working on BSE-affected dairy farms, shows that the probability of one CJD case having occurred among the latter group by chance is about 1 in 20.
 Even so, Dr Will believes that Mr Warhurst's disease was a coincidence not related to BSE exposure.
