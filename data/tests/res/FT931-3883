 GOVERNMENT veterinary and health experts were yesterday putting out reassuring messages about bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), or 'mad cow' disease, in the face of growing public anxiety.
 Dr Robert Will of Western General Hospital, Edinburgh, who is monitoring all CJD cases in the UK for the Department of Health, drew attention to Mr Warhurst's case without naming him in the Lancet, a medical journal.
 Statistical analysis, taking account of the average national incidence of CJD and the number of people working on BSE-affected dairy farms, shows that the probability of one CJD case having occurred among the latter group by chance is about 1 in 20.
