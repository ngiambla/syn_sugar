 MR Lewis Preston, World Bank president, yesterday promised to strengthen the bank's efforts to reduce poverty in developing countries. 'Poverty reduction must be the benchmark against which our performance as a development institution is judged,' he said.
 However, he failed to respond to demands from the Clinton administration for the bank to set more precise targets for the proportion of lending that should have an explicit poverty focus.
 The share of bank lending allocated for 'human resource development' is still only 14 per cent, in spite of repeated calls from Mr Preston for an increased emphasis on investment in people.
