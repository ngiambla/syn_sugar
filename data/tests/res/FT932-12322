 _AN-DD2CUABHFT 930429 FT 29 APR 93 / World Bank pledges drive to cut poverty: Preston fails to respond to demands from Clinton to set more precise targets By MICHAEL PROWSE WASHINGTON MR Lewis Preston, World Bank president, yesterday promised to strengthen the bank's efforts to reduce poverty in developing countries. 'Poverty reduction must be the benchmark against which our performance as a development institution is judged,' he said.
 In congressional testimony this week, Mr Lloyd Bentsen, US treasury secretary, said the US wanted to see more funding that 'will create social and economic safety nets' for poor people most affected by war, civil strife and economic mismanagement. 'We will look for specific increases in the share of lending going for these purposes.' In fiscal 1992, nearly half of all World Bank adjustment loans failed to include specific poverty reduction measures, in spite of calls from Mr Preston to put greater emphasis on poverty relief.
