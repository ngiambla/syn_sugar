 KEY Hispanic groups in the US are making stringent side agreements, aimed at protecting worker rights and the environment, a condition of their support for the North American Trade Agreement between the US, Canada and Mexico.
 The announcement will deal a blow to supporters of Nafta, who counted on Hispanic backing to get the agreement through Congress.
 Mr Abel Guerra of the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce said he feared side agreements dealing with issues on the environment and labour rights could jeopardise Nafta. 'It's a giant opportunity we can't let go to waste,' he said.
