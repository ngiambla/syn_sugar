 Several Hispanic leaders said last week that the Clinton administration also had to present a 'blueprint' of a plan to retrain displaced workers before they would give their support.
 The announcement will deal a blow to supporters of Nafta, who counted on Hispanic backing to get the agreement through Congress.
 But the US Hispanic community is deeply divided over whether to endorse the agreement.
 Mr Richard Lopez, an aide to the congressional Hispanic caucus, said last week that differing opinion had prevented the group taking an official position on Nafta.
 Mr Abel Guerra of the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce said he feared side agreements dealing with issues on the environment and labour rights could jeopardise Nafta. 'It's a giant opportunity we can't let go to waste,' he said.
