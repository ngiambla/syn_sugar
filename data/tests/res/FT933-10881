 IN California, labour leaders, environmentalists and the 'Perotistas' supporting Mr Ross Perot have signed a Declaration of War against the North American Free Trade Agreement.

 With just a shoestring budget - no more than Dollars 200,000 (Pounds 134,230) a year in cash - foes of Nafta have worked for three years to mount a massive campaign to win the hearts and minds of the American public.
 One California gubernatorial hopeful, Ms Kathleen Brown - sister of former Governor Jerry Brown - has been stalked by demonstrators, who even follow her to fundraising events.
