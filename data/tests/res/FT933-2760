 The continued economic sluggishness and the drumbeat of corporate layoff announcements have hurt the pact's chances and presented the administration with a formidable challenge.
 Fifty per cent of the Americans polled disagreed with the administration's argument that more jobs will be created than lost and 54 per cent said that wages would be forced downward so that US companies and workers could compete with Mexico.
