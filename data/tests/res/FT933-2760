 Fifty per cent of the Americans polled disagreed with the administration's argument that more jobs will be created than lost and 54 per cent said that wages would be forced downward so that US companies and workers could compete with Mexico.
 But they took heart from Tuesday's presidential show: President Clinton's passionate insistence that the realities of the global marketplace be faced; President Carter's attack on Mr Ross Perot, the populist billionaire, as a demagogue with 'unlimited financial resources,'; President Bush's praise of Mexican President Carlos Salinas; President Ford's warning that the country would be overrun by impoverished immigrants from the South if they are given no work at home. 'It was a revival,' said Texas Congressman JJ Pickle. 'I think Nafta was born again.' To keep the pro-Nafta case before the public, President Clinton Wednesday took off for New Orleans and top officials in his administration fanned out on speaking tours across the country.
 In response to similar charges by hundreds of grassroots environmental, citizen and labour groups, Vice president Al Gore, Senator Max Baucus and other lawmakers with green credentials, accompanied by six leaders of the largest national environmental groups who helped negotiate the environmental side pact, held a briefing to praise Nafta's environmental safeguards.
 Seemingly unfazed by Nafta's new show of life, the Citizens Trade Campaign, one of the umbrella opposition groups, called a press conference to 'debunk' the Clinton Administration claim Nafta would create 200,000 jobs in the next five years.
 He will join forces with Congressman David Bonior, the majority whip, and three of Mr Bonior's lieutenants, leaving the House Speaker, Tom Foley, nearly alone on the defence, among the leadership. 'I do not think we have articulated well - the supporters of Nafta - the very positive and energetic reasons that can be offered for supporting this,' Mr Foley acknowledged.
