 THE MAN President Bill Clinton has chosen to head the task force to help get his free trade pact with Canada and Mexico ratified may lack experience in international trade arenas.
 But he comes to Washington well prepared for the kind of back-room political arm-twisting that will be required to persuade a divided Congress to pass it.
 William Daley is younger brother and chief adviser to Chicago's mayor Richard M Daley and offspring of the legendary Democratic machine 'Boss', the late Richard J Daley.
 Unlike his hot-tempered and very public brother, 45-year-old Bill Daley is a smooth-talking behind-the-scenes operator with important connections in Washington and long-standing ties with organised labour.
 Mr Daley accepted the Nafta position after being passed over for a cabinet position and turning down an offer to be Mr Clinton's chief negotiator at the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade in Geneva.
