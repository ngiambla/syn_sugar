 President Bill Clinton's pledge to 'end welfare as we know it' was one of the most popular lines in last year's election campaign.
 It claims both measures will help shift people off welfare by 'making work pay.' The budget advanced this cause by expanding the earned income tax credit (a kind of negative income tax).
 If healthcare reform guarantees health insurance for all workers, welfare recipients will no longer be able to reject jobs on the grounds that they stand to lose their health care benefits.
 In addition, the administration promises to bolster the economic position of welfare mothers by strictly enforcing laws requiring absent fathers to support their children financially.
 When pundits talk of a 'culture of welfare' they are referring mainly to the Dollars 20bn spent on Aid for Families with Dependent Children, a benefit received by 5m single-parent families.
