 President Bill Clinton's pledge to 'end welfare as we know it' was one of the most popular lines in last year's election campaign.
 Many conservatives favour the concept of a strict time limit.
 This solution is more appealing than a mere cessation of benefits.
 Fortunately there is a fall back position for Mr Clinton: the bipartisan Family Support Act of 1988, which he helped steer through Congress.
 This recognised the impossibility of ending welfare overnight and instead set targets for the gradual introduction of 'workfare'.
