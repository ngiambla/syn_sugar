 President Bill Clinton's pledge to 'end welfare as we know it' was one of the most popular lines in last year's election campaign.
 It claims both measures will help shift people off welfare by 'making work pay.' The budget advanced this cause by expanding the earned income tax credit (a kind of negative income tax).
 This gives poor working families a cash bonus of up to Dollars 2,500 a year, increasing the incentive to take low paid jobs.
 In addition, the administration promises to bolster the economic position of welfare mothers by strictly enforcing laws requiring absent fathers to support their children financially.
 When pundits talk of a 'culture of welfare' they are referring mainly to the Dollars 20bn spent on Aid for Families with Dependent Children, a benefit received by 5m single-parent families.
 After two years, welfare cheques would thus be replaced by the offer of a government job at slightly below the private sector minimum wage.
 Fortunately there is a fall back position for Mr Clinton: the bipartisan Family Support Act of 1988, which he helped steer through Congress.
