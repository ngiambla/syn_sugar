 Richard Lacey, a microbiology professor at Leeds University and the leading critic of government policy on BSE, said the deaths this year of two farmers whose herds had suffered from mad cow disease could not be put down to chance.
 He believes that BSE can trigger human brain disease. 'Our worst predictions are coming true,' he said. 'I find it unbelievable that the government and their hand-picked advisers can go on telling the public there is no danger.' The advisers, led by the government's chief medical officer Kenneth Calman and chief veterinary officer Keith Meldrum, put out a detailed statement to justify their view that last month's death of 65-year-old Duncan Templeman - following that of Peter Warhurst, 61, a year ago - showed 'no features that give cause for undue concern'.
 One argument put forward by the health department is that CJD has such a long incubation period - typically 10 to 20 years - that clinical symptoms would not yet have appeared, even if BSE had triggered any cases of CJD. 'Since the illness of the cows (in Templeman's herd) and the patient occurred within months of each other, the animals and the patient had presumably incubated disease in parallel for some years,' the health department said. 'It is most unlikely therefore that there is any direct link between the cases of BSE and the occurrence of disease in the patient.' Another reassuring argument is that both farmers showed clinical features typical of the 'sporadic form' of CJD - of unknown cause - that usually occurs in late middle age.
 The second annual report of Will's National CJD Surveillance Unit in Edinburgh, published last month, shows what looks at first sight like a disturbing rise in incidence: from 32 UK cases in the year ended April 1991 to 37 in 1991/92 and 46 in 1992/3.
 Scientists trying to understand the epidemic face an unusual problem: BSE, scrapie and CJD are caused by a bizarre, infectious agent, the prion, which does not follow the normal rules of microbiology.
