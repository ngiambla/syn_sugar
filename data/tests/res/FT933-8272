 The epidemic of bovine spongiform encephalopathy or 'mad cow' disease - which has killed more than 100,000 animals in the UK - is causing a new wave of public concern.
 New cases are still running at almost 1,000 a week and last month a second dairy farmer died of Creutzfeld-Jacob Disease, a brain disorder similar to BSE.
 The handful of patients known to have developed CJD through infection (from contaminated human growth hormone) showed a different pattern of symptoms.
 The source of infection was protein-rich cattle feed contaminated with scrapie, a related brain disease of sheep.
 Or - in the case of BSE - it may arrive from another animal.
