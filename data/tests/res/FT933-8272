 _AN-DHQCUACJFT 930817 FT 17 AUG 93 / Technology: An outbreak of conflicting opinions - Despite assurances that BSE is waning, there is new concern about the epidemic By CLIVE COOKSON The epidemic of bovine spongiform encephalopathy or 'mad cow' disease - which has killed more than 100,000 animals in the UK - is causing a new wave of public concern.
 One argument put forward by the health department is that CJD has such a long incubation period - typically 10 to 20 years - that clinical symptoms would not yet have appeared, even if BSE had triggered any cases of CJD. 'Since the illness of the cows (in Templeman's herd) and the patient occurred within months of each other, the animals and the patient had presumably incubated disease in parallel for some years,' the health department said. 'It is most unlikely therefore that there is any direct link between the cases of BSE and the occurrence of disease in the patient.' Another reassuring argument is that both farmers showed clinical features typical of the 'sporadic form' of CJD - of unknown cause - that usually occurs in late middle age.
