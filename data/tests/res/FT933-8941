 The mine is River Ranch, 12km upstream from Beitbridge on the southern border of Zimbabwe.
 The South African group eventually gave up its rights to River Ranch in 1991 after it failed to reach agreement with the Zimbabwe government about marketing the diamonds.
 Mr Robin Baxter-Brown, chairman of Redaurum Red Lake Mines, one of the new joint owners of River Ranch, said yesterday that De Beers bulldozed the site before leaving.
 He helped Auridiam, an Australian-quoted company that he co-founded and where he was once chairman, win the mining rights to River Ranch when they were put up for tender by the Zimbabwe government in 1991.
 The joint venturers have exclusive exploration rights to 13,474 hectares of ground around the mine and Mr Baxter-Brown suggested the chances of finding another diamond deposit were good.
