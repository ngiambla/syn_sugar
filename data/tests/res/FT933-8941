 INVESTORS are being asked to provide money for a diamond mine near the River Limpopo in Zimbabwe, which De Beers, the South African group that dominates the diamond business, discovered but then let get away.
 Also, all documentation about the deposit has mysteriously disappeared from the Zimbabwe Ministry of Mines. (A De Beers official said equipment would usually be removed from a site before it was abandoned but he could neither confirm nor deny that River Ranch had been bulldozed.) Mr Baxter-Brown is a South African geologist who started his career with De Beers and has 36 years of diamond exploration experience.
 He helped Auridiam, an Australian-quoted company that he co-founded and where he was once chairman, win the mining rights to River Ranch when they were put up for tender by the Zimbabwe government in 1991.
 Redaurum, which is quoted in Toronto, is raising CDollars 1.5m (Pounds 780,000) net of expenses via a placing by London stockbrokers Carr Kitcatt &amp; Aitken to help boost annual output from the present rate of 50,000 carats to 330,000 carats.
 Diamonds are being sold directly to the market in Antwerp, Belgium, and not through De Beers' Central Selling Organisation, which controls about 80 per cent of the world rough (uncut) diamond trade.
