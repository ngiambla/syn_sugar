 The mine is River Ranch, 12km upstream from Beitbridge on the southern border of Zimbabwe.
 De Beers found diamonds there in 1975 but decided to concentrate instead on another site 60km away and, importantly, given the heat generated by the politics of the region, across the border in South Africa.
 After an investment of Dollars 500m that site went into production as Venetia, one of the world's biggest diamond mines.
 The South African group eventually gave up its rights to River Ranch in 1991 after it failed to reach agreement with the Zimbabwe government about marketing the diamonds.
 Mr Robin Baxter-Brown, chairman of Redaurum Red Lake Mines, one of the new joint owners of River Ranch, said yesterday that De Beers bulldozed the site before leaving.
