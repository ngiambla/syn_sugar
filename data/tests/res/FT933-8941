 INVESTORS are being asked to provide money for a diamond mine near the River Limpopo in Zimbabwe, which De Beers, the South African group that dominates the diamond business, discovered but then let get away.
 De Beers found diamonds there in 1975 but decided to concentrate instead on another site 60km away and, importantly, given the heat generated by the politics of the region, across the border in South Africa.
 Redaurum, which is quoted in Toronto, is raising CDollars 1.5m (Pounds 780,000) net of expenses via a placing by London stockbrokers Carr Kitcatt &amp; Aitken to help boost annual output from the present rate of 50,000 carats to 330,000 carats.
