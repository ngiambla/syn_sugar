 INVESTORS are being asked to provide money for a diamond mine near the River Limpopo in Zimbabwe, which De Beers, the South African group that dominates the diamond business, discovered but then let get away.
 The mine is River Ranch, 12km upstream from Beitbridge on the southern border of Zimbabwe.
 De Beers found diamonds there in 1975 but decided to concentrate instead on another site 60km away and, importantly, given the heat generated by the politics of the region, across the border in South Africa.
 The South African group eventually gave up its rights to River Ranch in 1991 after it failed to reach agreement with the Zimbabwe government about marketing the diamonds.
 Also, all documentation about the deposit has mysteriously disappeared from the Zimbabwe Ministry of Mines. (A De Beers official said equipment would usually be removed from a site before it was abandoned but he could neither confirm nor deny that River Ranch had been bulldozed.) Mr Baxter-Brown is a South African geologist who started his career with De Beers and has 36 years of diamond exploration experience.
