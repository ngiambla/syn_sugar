 The welfare state, the glue that binds the social fabric of the world's advanced capitalist economies, is coming unstuck.
 The immediate cause is its increasing cost at a time when budget deficits burden most of the 24 member states of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.
 Rising welfare spending has been a significant factor in the average increase in net state borrowing of 3 percentage points of GDP across the OECD between 1989 and 1992.
 Reform of national welfare systems to bring costs under control is now on the political agenda throughout the OECD, as countries struggle to rein in government spending.
 Rising unemployment has added to the cost of the welfare state in both unemployment benefits and general family support for low-income families.
