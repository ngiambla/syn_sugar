 Rising welfare spending has been a significant factor in the average increase in net state borrowing of 3 percentage points of GDP across the OECD between 1989 and 1992.
 Reform of national welfare systems to bring costs under control is now on the political agenda throughout the OECD, as countries struggle to rein in government spending.
 Total government spending in the OECD countries has risen from 28.1 per cent of GDP in 1960 to 43.8 per cent in 1990.
 Rising unemployment has added to the cost of the welfare state in both unemployment benefits and general family support for low-income families.
 Automatic indexation of pensions to earnings has been weakened in Germany and ended altogether in the UK for the basic flat-rate pension.
 But what most concerns those responsible for public finances is the strength of underlying pressures on welfare spending that will push costs upwards in the future.
 The number of over-65s in the 24 OECD member states rose from 61m in 1960 to more than 100m in 1990.
 The standard measure for this is the age dependency ratio, the population over 65 as a percentage of the population aged 15-64.
 The most immediate impact of these demographic changes will be on pensions, where costs will in any case rise as pension schemes continue to mature.
 But the OECD has also drawn attention to the need for action to anticipate the funding implications of the rise in the number of elderly people.
