 The immediate cause is its increasing cost at a time when budget deficits burden most of the 24 member states of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.
 Rising welfare spending has been a significant factor in the average increase in net state borrowing of 3 percentage points of GDP across the OECD between 1989 and 1992.
 In the longer term, there are fears that the cost of the welfare state could become insupportable as populations age over the next 50 years.
 While short-term measures may ease the immediate budgetary pressures, more fundamental reforms will be needed if the welfare state is not to undermine the economic performance that has underpinned its enormous expansion since the second world war.
 Reform of national welfare systems to bring costs under control is now on the political agenda throughout the OECD, as countries struggle to rein in government spending.
 Total government spending in the OECD countries has risen from 28.1 per cent of GDP in 1960 to 43.8 per cent in 1990.
 The biggest element in this growth has been the cost of pensions, healthcare, unemployment benefits and family support.
 Social security payments more than doubled during this period, from 7 per cent of GDP to 15.4 per cent.
 The largest single budget item in most welfare states is the cost of publicly provided pensions.
 Expenditure has risen rapidly in recent decades, more than doubling its average share of GDP in OECD countries since 1960.
 As with pensions, health systems have become more generous in the wake of economic growth - for example, including grafts and transplants that were previously regarded as experimental.
 Rising unemployment has added to the cost of the welfare state in both unemployment benefits and general family support for low-income families.
 But it has also helped to push up the budget for sickness and invalidity benefits, which often offer an escape route into early retirement for older workers.
 Most OECD countries have recognised the need to curb growth in these main areas of welfare spending during the 1980s, and have introduced policies to tackle the underlying causes.
 Automatic indexation of pensions to earnings has been weakened in Germany and ended altogether in the UK for the basic flat-rate pension.
 Although there are considerable differences between national health systems, healthcare reforms in countries such as the UK and the Netherlands are increasingly converging on models that use competition and price incentives to control costs.
 Germany and Japan, for example, will both have age dependency ratios of 34 per cent by 2020 - one person over the age of 65 for every three people between 15 and 64.
