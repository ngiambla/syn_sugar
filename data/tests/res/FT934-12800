 The immediate cause is its increasing cost at a time when budget deficits burden most of the 24 member states of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.
 Rising welfare spending has been a significant factor in the average increase in net state borrowing of 3 percentage points of GDP across the OECD between 1989 and 1992.
 Reform of national welfare systems to bring costs under control is now on the political agenda throughout the OECD, as countries struggle to rein in government spending.
 The biggest element in this growth has been the cost of pensions, healthcare, unemployment benefits and family support.
 The largest single budget item in most welfare states is the cost of publicly provided pensions.
 Expenditure has risen rapidly in recent decades, more than doubling its average share of GDP in OECD countries since 1960.
 As with pensions, health systems have become more generous in the wake of economic growth - for example, including grafts and transplants that were previously regarded as experimental.
 Rising unemployment has added to the cost of the welfare state in both unemployment benefits and general family support for low-income families.
 But it has also helped to push up the budget for sickness and invalidity benefits, which often offer an escape route into early retirement for older workers.
 Most OECD countries have recognised the need to curb growth in these main areas of welfare spending during the 1980s, and have introduced policies to tackle the underlying causes.
