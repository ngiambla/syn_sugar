 Agreement by the administration is expected to bring Mr Torres and at least 7 other Hispanic congressmen into the pro-Nafta fold.
 The administration believes it can garner 200-210 pro-Nafta votes, out of the 218 needed.
 The White House 'war room' believes the vote currently breaks down into 110 Republicans in favour, 65-75 Democrats in favour; and 20-30 leaning towards it.
 Under this hopeful scenario, the White House will use the last few days before the November 17 House vote to cajole, bargain and twist arms to get the remaining 8 votes.
 The pro-Nafta campaign this week began moving into high gear.
