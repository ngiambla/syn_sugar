 FT934-13350 _AN-DJVCQABEFT 931022 FT 22 OCT 93 / World Trade News: US ready to back Nafta bank - White House steps up campaign on pact with aid for affected communities By NANCY DUNNE WASHINGTON THE Clinton administration will soon announce support for a North American Development Bank, which would fund projects in communities hit by job losses resulting from the North American Free Trade Agreement.
 The so-called NADBank has been strongly supported by Congressman Esteban Torres, who has insisted on some sort of lending institution to support adjustment throughout the continent.
 Agreement by the administration is expected to bring Mr Torres and at least 7 other Hispanic congressmen into the pro-Nafta fold.
 The administration believes it can garner 200-210 pro-Nafta votes, out of the 218 needed.
 It is assuming that every undecided congressman only wants a reason - favourable constituent mail - to vote for the pact, and it is pushing feverishly to turn anti-Nafta public opinion around.
 The White House 'war room' believes the vote currently breaks down into 110 Republicans in favour, 65-75 Democrats in favour; and 20-30 leaning towards it.
 Under this hopeful scenario, the White House will use the last few days before the November 17 House vote to cajole, bargain and twist arms to get the remaining 8 votes.
 They count 190-200 Democrats against, 10-15 Democrats leaning against, and 5-10 Republicans opposed.
 State by state, undecided congressmen are being lured to the White House for intimate briefings, as are business leaders and journalists.
