 After seven long years, the US Congress this week passed its first significant gun control law since the assassinations of Mr Robert Kennedy and Rev Martin Luther King Jr in 1968.
 The legislation - known as the Brady bill after Mr James Brady, the former White House press secretary severely wounded in an assassination attempt on President Ronald Reagan - would impose a five-day waiting period on purchases of handguns.
 Studies of state laws requiring some form of background check suggest, however, that at least some sales to convicted felons have been stopped, and some suspected criminals have been caught when they tried to buy a gun.
 Mr Neal Knox, sacked from a lobbying position with the NRA in the 1980s but now one of its elected directors, argues that the second amendment is the citizen's 'freedom insurance plan' against tyranny.
 First, left-wing Democrats have begun to champion gun control as a supplement to tough anti-crime measures, rather than an alternative; they have recaptured much of the 'tough on crime' high ground by backing boot camps for young delinquents, harsher sentences and stiffer restrictions on parole or habeas corpus appeals.
