 A 'not this Nafta' rally on Saturday provided little competition for the college 'game of the century' - Florida State University against Notre Dame.
 The organisers said they were sending a message to Virginia's three wavering congressmen that a 'yes' vote on Nafta in the House on Wednesday would be 'remembered in November'.
 It puts decision-making in the hands of international panels, which undermines our judicial system.' He says he is concerned about the loss of Virginia's tax base as companies move production to Mexico and place continuous downward pressure on wages. 'The administration is selling everything it can to every congressman it can.

 Mr Greenwood's congressman, Norman Sisisky, spent Friday meeting groups from both sides. 'He is trying to sort through the misleading information,' says his press secretary.
 As a member of the House armed services committee he expects the foreign policy implications of the Nafta vote to weigh heavily in his decision.

'The public is becoming less inclined to see the US as arbiter of worldwide human behaviour and wishes to get out of our foreign policy involvements,' he says.

 On Friday, after the fifth pro-Nafta congressman announced his position, a dispirited Lorrie Beckwith, an opposition organiser, said her campaign had been hindered early on by a lack of unity.
 A visit to Congressman Sisisky had not been encouraging, says Mr Beckwith. 'He says he had a bad feeling about the agreement in his gut.
