 The organisers said they were sending a message to Virginia's three wavering congressmen that a 'yes' vote on Nafta in the House on Wednesday would be 'remembered in November'.
 Mr Greenwood's congressman, Norman Sisisky, spent Friday meeting groups from both sides. 'He is trying to sort through the misleading information,' says his press secretary.
 As a member of the House armed services committee he expects the foreign policy implications of the Nafta vote to weigh heavily in his decision.
 The anti-Nafta forces on Saturday published long lists of business contributors to the pro-Nafta congressmen. 'Constituents only have votes to give, and it seems these congressmen are having a hard time hearing their message,' the cover page said.
 On Friday, after the fifth pro-Nafta congressman announced his position, a dispirited Lorrie Beckwith, an opposition organiser, said her campaign had been hindered early on by a lack of unity.
