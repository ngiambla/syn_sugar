 _AN-DKLCNAA0FT 931112 FT 12 NOV 93 / US public opinion swings behind Nafta By NANCY DUNNE and DAMIAN FRASER WASHINGTON, MEXICO CITY THE FIGHT over the North American Free Trade Agreement yesterday shifted outside Washington to the Congressional districts of members, sampling public opinion at home during this Veterans' Day holiday weekend.
 The pro-Nafta forces, exulting over the debate victory of Vice President Al Gore over Texan billionaire Ross Perot, hoped they had finally captured the elusive momentum necessary to carry them to victory in the House vote next Wednesday.
 Arthur Andersen &amp; Company yesterday released a survey, by its tax and business advisory service, which found that large majorities of executives of medium-sized companies in Canada, Mexico and the US strongly support Nafta.
 Mr Perot claimed Mexicans were treated worse than animals and livestock in the US, were oppressed by the government, and enjoyed few if any labour and democratic rights.
