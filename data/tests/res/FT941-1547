 The German government yesterday announced the launch of a new research project to examine whether the cattle disease bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) can be transmitted to human beings.
 The initiative comes as the country is pushing for a European Union ban on British beef imports, arguing that there is still no conclusive evidence that the disease cannot affect humans.
 Seven German universities and research institutes will be sponsored by the country's research and technology ministry to examine possible connections between the origins of BSE and two other diseases, Creutzfeldt Jakob disease and Gerstmann Straussler syndrome, which very rarely affect humans.
 I personally think (British beef) should not be imported.' Contaminated British beef will be discussed at a meeting of EU health ministers on March 30, but a German official said that any decisions about a ban would be made by the union's agriculture ministers, who were likely to argue that existing safeguards were sufficient.
 In 1992, the last year for which figures are available, Germany imported 2,092 tonnes of British beef - 2 per cent of all its beef imports from other EU countries - and 13 tonnes of veal.
