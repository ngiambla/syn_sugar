 Seven German universities and research institutes will be sponsored by the country's research and technology ministry to examine possible connections between the origins of BSE and two other diseases, Creutzfeldt Jakob disease and Gerstmann Straussler syndrome, which very rarely affect humans.
 Several German scientists have expressed concern that BSE - popularly known as 'mad cow disease' because of the way it debilitates the brains of cattle -may be transmissible to humans who eat contaminated beef or take medicines made with ingredients from contaminated animals. 'The danger that BSE can be transmitted to humans is minimal or non-existent,' said Professor Hans Kretzschmar from Gottingen University. 'However, we do not know that it is non-existent.
 I personally think (British beef) should not be imported.' Contaminated British beef will be discussed at a meeting of EU health ministers on March 30, but a German official said that any decisions about a ban would be made by the union's agriculture ministers, who were likely to argue that existing safeguards were sufficient.
