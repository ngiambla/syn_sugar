 Some regional government officials and US legislators supportive of the Caribbean's concerns - which include the possible diversion of investments to Mexico - have now concluded that what would amount to a de facto extension of Nafta is unlikely.
 What the Caribbean basin countries want is quick action by legislators in Washington, and then in Ottawa and Mexico City, to ratify proposals by some US congressmen to put all the region's exports to the US and Canada on a par with Mexico's.
 The parity proposals are aimed at giving Caribbean basin countries an open door to the Nafta market for three years.
 Mr Edwin Carrington, secretary-general of the Caribbean Community (Caricom), said he expected parity to be given to 'only a few' of the region's exports, including textiles. 'The parity issue, which is the first step we are seeking, is becoming a case of limited benefits for a very great price,' he said.
 As Caribbean economies grow our ability to absorb US exports will also increase. 'Currently 60 cents of every dollar earned by the Caribbean returns to the US through the purchase of US goods, compared with only 10 cents for each dollar spent by Asia.
