 During this time they would have the opportunity of negotiating their future trade relationship with the Nafta signatories, with the option of seeking membership either as individual states or as a group. 'President Clinton has said his administration will ensure that the benefits of Nafta are felt by the Caribbean countries,' said Mr Manuel Esquivel, prime minister of Belize. 'We are heartened by President Salinas' assurances that it is not Mexico's intention to take investments away from the Caribbean.
 Mr Edwin Carrington, secretary-general of the Caribbean Community (Caricom), said he expected parity to be given to 'only a few' of the region's exports, including textiles. 'The parity issue, which is the first step we are seeking, is becoming a case of limited benefits for a very great price,' he said.
 While willing to give parity to a few products, the US wanted the Caribbean basin countries to meet new conditions, including bilateral investment treaties, intellectual property rights agreements, workers' rights and environmental legislation, democracy, good governance and accountability, Mr Carrington said. 'The costs of parity are much higher than we anticipated and any thoughts of full membership of Nafta are as far down the road as they ever were.' In presenting their case for parity, Caribbean leaders have argued that the US and Canada will also be the losers if there is extensive economic dislocation in the region caused by a loss of markets to Mexico.
