 At the other end of the tunnel Cluttons reports Belgians and Dutch registering at the Canterbury office for period cottages for around Pounds 200,000, and French and Belgians at the Folkestone office - where David Parry reports that Arabs are interested in blocks of flats on the sea front. 'The tunnel has more psychological impact than anything.
 Buyers don't see that yet.' Once the tunnel is open, said Parry, industry will be attracted to the area and people will move in.
 Central and east Kent need a stimulus but it may take four or five years before there is any evidence of new opportunities in the area.
