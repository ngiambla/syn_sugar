 The UK will get strong backing from Brussels today when Germany seeks a ban on British beef exports because of fear of 'mad cow disease', or bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE).
 Bonn is calling for a ban on all live cattle and beef exports from the UK after the discovery in Germany of BSE imported from the UK.
 The commission has reminded Germany that it is the EU that sets veterinary rules, and that there is no scientific evidence proving a link between BSE and Creutzfeld-Jakob disease, which affects humans.
 Since June 1990 there has been a ban on the export of live cattle over six months from the UK, and on the progeny of BSE-affected cows.
 In addition, all British exports of bone-in beef must be certified as coming from herds that have been free of 'mad cow disease' for two years.
