 The UK will get strong backing from Brussels today when Germany seeks a ban on British beef exports because of fear of 'mad cow disease', or bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE).
 The commission has reminded Germany that it is the EU that sets veterinary rules, and that there is no scientific evidence proving a link between BSE and Creutzfeld-Jakob disease, which affects humans.
 A series of restrictions have been imposed in the UK beef sector, which Britain and the commission say are working.
 In 1990, certain bovine offals, like brain and spleen, were banned for human consumption.
 In addition, all British exports of bone-in beef must be certified as coming from herds that have been free of 'mad cow disease' for two years.
