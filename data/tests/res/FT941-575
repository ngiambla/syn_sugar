 The UK will get strong backing from Brussels today when Germany seeks a ban on British beef exports because of fear of 'mad cow disease', or bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE).
 The European Commission planned to tell Germany that it would take legal action if Bonn attempted to introduce a unilateral ban, commission officials said yesterday.
 Bonn is calling for a ban on all live cattle and beef exports from the UK after the discovery in Germany of BSE imported from the UK.
 The commission has reminded Germany that it is the EU that sets veterinary rules, and that there is no scientific evidence proving a link between BSE and Creutzfeld-Jakob disease, which affects humans.
