 FT942-11114 _AN-EEFEDAHLFT 940506 FT 06 MAY 94 / Survey of The Channel Tunnel (16): Big potential benefits - Belgium looks for economic spin-offs By EMMA TUCKER The official opening of the Channel Tunnel later this year promises to help revitalise the north-west regions of Belgium, even though the country's biggest ports will suffer a loss of traffic.
 According to Mr Anthony Vande Candelare, an urban planner who made a study of the influence of the Channel Tunnel on the west of Belgium and the North of France: 'Overnight, the Belgian coast and the North of France will become the centre of Europe.' Mr Jo Libeer, managing director of the Courtrai chamber of commerce, is equally optimistic about the likely impact on the area of the tunnel. 'With the TGV and the chunnel this region, which was sort of in the corner of Europe, will now be in the middle of a new developing area,' he says.
 In its last economic survey of the country, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development said the Belgian economy had deteriorated 'progressively' since the 1980s. 'And over the last 10 to 12 months it has taken a distinct turn for the worse.' Furthermore, Flanders, the area most likely to benefit from the arrival of the tunnel, has recently suffered more rapid increases in unemployment than in Wallonia and the Brussels region.
