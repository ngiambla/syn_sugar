 The Belgian chambers in the regions most directly affected believe there are two main areas for development: firstly, increasing traffic through western Flanders as holidaymakers and freight carriers head towards the tunnel-opening in Calais; and secondly tourism.
 Once this is done it will be possible to drive from Russia to England without leaving a motorway, says Mr Philippe Claerhout, chairman of the Veurne chamber of commerce and industry.
 There is, however, a danger that Belgium will not make the most of the commercial opportunities - 'we will try to attract new industry, but our region is very small and our industrial zones are full,' says Mr Ludo Verstraete, of the Veurne chamber of commerce.
 As Mr Claerhout says: 'We need to convince people from other countries that it is worth their while to stop in Westhoek at the time of their journey through the North of Europe to England.' The potential is there.
 West Flanders is home to some of the best-known World War One battlefields, and promoters of the region insist that its large, open green spaces will, when properly developed, attract foreign visitors.
