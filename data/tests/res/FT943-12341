 Some 160km west of Tokyo in Japan's coastal Tokai region is what may be the world's most dense array of geophysical instruments.
 But for increasingly vocal sceptics in Japan, it is at best a misguided effort that wastes money and is dangerously misleading the public.
 In Japan, prediction took on urgency when seismologists concluded that the Tokai area was overdue for a significant quake.
 The Suruga Trough, a deep submarine trench running just offshore, forms the boundary between two of the earth's tectonic plates.
 If the entire section ruptures again, the resulting quake could reach eight on the Richter scale, endangering the lives of 10m residents in the area.
 Japan has had numerous killer quakes outside the Tokai monitoring network, including a 7.8 earthquake off the coast of Hokkaido last year that claimed more than 200 lives.
 Prediction research elsewhere withered as scientists who could not convince review committees of the scientific merit of their research lost their funding.
 Japan's prediction research activities, primarily overseen by the Ministry of Education, Science and Culture, are subject to no such review.
 The public, and even public officials, remain largely unaware that Japan's scientists are debating whether prediction is impossible or merely difficult.
 Most citizens do not realise that Tokai is the only region in which the government even intends to attempt a short-term warning.
