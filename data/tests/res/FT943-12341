 Some 160km west of Tokyo in Japan's coastal Tokai region is what may be the world's most dense array of geophysical instruments.
 More than 150 meters and gauges track seismic activity, rock strain, crustal tilt, tidal movements and ground water levels.
 The data are telemetered to Tokyo where they are monitored around the clock in the hope that six experts, to be summoned at a moment's notice, will recognise unusual phenomena that may indicate an imminent earthquake.
 If the committee so advises, Japan's prime minister will issue an earthquake warning for the Tokai area.
 Despite the protests, however, Japan's earthquake prediction programme rolls along on inertia, insularity and unrealistic public expectations.
