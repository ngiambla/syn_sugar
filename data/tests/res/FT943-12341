 But for increasingly vocal sceptics in Japan, it is at best a misguided effort that wastes money and is dangerously misleading the public.
 In Japan, prediction took on urgency when seismologists concluded that the Tokai area was overdue for a significant quake.
 Prediction research elsewhere withered as scientists who could not convince review committees of the scientific merit of their research lost their funding.
 The public, and even public officials, remain largely unaware that Japan's scientists are debating whether prediction is impossible or merely difficult.
 Most citizens do not realise that Tokai is the only region in which the government even intends to attempt a short-term warning.
