 More than 150 meters and gauges track seismic activity, rock strain, crustal tilt, tidal movements and ground water levels.
 The data are telemetered to Tokyo where they are monitored around the clock in the hope that six experts, to be summoned at a moment's notice, will recognise unusual phenomena that may indicate an imminent earthquake.
 If the committee so advises, Japan's prime minister will issue an earthquake warning for the Tokai area.
 Trains will be stopped, traffic routed out of the area, stores closed and pupils let out of schools.
 And then everyone will wait for an earthquake measuring eight on the Richter scale.
 Long after the rest of the world has abandoned hope of predicting earthquakes, Japan continues to spend Dollars 2.5m (Pounds 1.6m) a year monitoring the Tokai region and close to Dollars 100m more on general earthquake prediction research.
 But for increasingly vocal sceptics in Japan, it is at best a misguided effort that wastes money and is dangerously misleading the public.
 Despite the protests, however, Japan's earthquake prediction programme rolls along on inertia, insularity and unrealistic public expectations.
 Japan made earthquake prediction a national project in 1965 when scientists throughout the world were optimistic about prediction.
 In Japan, prediction took on urgency when seismologists concluded that the Tokai area was overdue for a significant quake.
