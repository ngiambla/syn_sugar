 The Jwaneng mine, on the fringes of the Kalahari desert in Botswana, is known as 'a gem in the world of gems' because it almost certainly is the richest diamond mine in the world - at least in terms of the value of the stones it yields.
 It, and the country's two other (smaller) diamond mines, between them account for 50 per cent of the government's revenue and 40 per cent of the country's gross domestic product.
 Mr Loz Shaw, chief geologist, says drilling down to 600 metres shows there are still plenty of diamonds at that depth and so the pit will go down at least that far.
 Mr Derrick Moore, the general manager, says this indicates mining in the open pit will last another 35 years - 'and then we might go underground'.
 If experience at De Beers' wholly-owned Finsch mine in South Africa is anything to go by, planning the underground development at Jwaneng might already have started.
 Unfortunately, things did not go completely as expected when underground mining started, to some extent because the development was designed by a management whose expertise was mainly in open pit mining.
 Mr Webb says the objective is to mine down to a depth of 830 metres, at which point there are not enough diamonds left in the ground to make recovery viable.
