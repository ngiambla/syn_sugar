 FT943-5628 _AN-EICAFAF2FT 940902 FT 02 SEP 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Showpiece diamond mine shares the market's strain By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent NORTHERN TRANSVAAL Turbulence in the global diamond markets is being felt even here at Venetia, De Beers' newest diamond mine, 30km from South Africa's borders with Botswana and Zimbabwe.
 Only weeks before the mine came into production in July 1992 at a cost of USDollars 400m, De Beers' Central Selling Organisation, which controls 80 per cent of world trade in rough (uncut) diamonds, imposed quotas on its producer-suppliers because of a flood of gem stones from Angola.
 For a time Venetia, the first mine of any sort in South Africa to gain permission for seven-day working, moved to a five-day week.
 Mr Gastrow is giving no forecasts but all this implies that output will be well below the 5.6m carats a year De Beers predicted Venetia would yield at full production.
