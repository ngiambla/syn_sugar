 Turbulence in the global diamond markets is being felt even here at Venetia, De Beers' newest diamond mine, 30km from South Africa's borders with Botswana and Zimbabwe.
 This year it has gone back to seven-day working as the quotas were eased so that the CSO is now accepting 85 per cent of the diamonds it contracted to take from producers.
 Mr Gastrow is giving no forecasts but all this implies that output will be well below the 5.6m carats a year De Beers predicted Venetia would yield at full production.
 The mine has also revitalised De Beers' production, as it is accounting for half the group's output in South Africa and replacing production from its 100-year-old Kimberley mines, which are now fading away.
 And, while Venetia is using conventional methods to mine about 500m tonnes of waste and to mine and process 100m tonnes of ore over its projected 23-year life, it is trying some highly innovative ideas about labour relations and environmental issues, at least as far as South Africa is concerned.
