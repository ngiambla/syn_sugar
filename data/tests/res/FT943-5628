 Turbulence in the global diamond markets is being felt even here at Venetia, De Beers' newest diamond mine, 30km from South Africa's borders with Botswana and Zimbabwe.
 This year it has gone back to seven-day working as the quotas were eased so that the CSO is now accepting 85 per cent of the diamonds it contracted to take from producers.
 However, there is still turmoil in the diamond market, caused by uncertainty about Russian exports following 'leaks' of stones from that country outside its contract with the CSO.
 Mr Gastrow is giving no forecasts but all this implies that output will be well below the 5.6m carats a year De Beers predicted Venetia would yield at full production.
 About 70 per cent of Venetia's diamonds are of gem quality and analysts suggest that at Dollars 100 a carat on average the mine is generating annual sales of about Dollars 500m.
 The mine has also revitalised De Beers' production, as it is accounting for half the group's output in South Africa and replacing production from its 100-year-old Kimberley mines, which are now fading away.
 Venetia's success is strategically important to De Beers because, when its output is added to that in Botswana and Namibia, it gives the group direct control over more than 50 per cent of world rough gem diamond output.
 This provides a major base for the CSO to work from and gives it a powerful position from which to negotiate with other producers in the diamond cartel.
 And, while Venetia is using conventional methods to mine about 500m tonnes of waste and to mine and process 100m tonnes of ore over its projected 23-year life, it is trying some highly innovative ideas about labour relations and environmental issues, at least as far as South Africa is concerned.
 Venetia is also breaking with the De Beers' tradition that, for security reasons, no equipment leaves the mine but is burried within the top security area once it is no longer useful.
