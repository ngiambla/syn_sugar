 Turbulence in the global diamond markets is being felt even here at Venetia, De Beers' newest diamond mine, 30km from South Africa's borders with Botswana and Zimbabwe.
 Last year the mine, building up rapidly, more than doubled output and processed 3.6m tonnes of ore to recover 4.96m carats.
 A mine of Venetia's size in the past would have employed 2,000.
 Venetia was the first new South African diamond mine for 25 years.
 It is also the country's biggest diamond mine and a major contributor of export earnings.
