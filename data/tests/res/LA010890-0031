 A controversial videotape being shown among activists nationwide shows Los Angeles police officers intentionally hurting the nonviolent demonstrators they are arresting.
 They press fingers under their noses.
 At one point, two officers twist a woman's arm till she rises from the ground, her face wrenched in agony.
 In another scene, a young man winces as officers lead him along.
 This time, however, the outcry -- including the videotapes of police in action -- comes from anti-abortion protesters with Operation Rescue, whose members tend to see themselves as law-and-order conservatives.
