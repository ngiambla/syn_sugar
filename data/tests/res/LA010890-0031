 A controversial videotape being shown among activists nationwide shows Los Angeles police officers intentionally hurting the nonviolent demonstrators they are arresting.
 They press fingers under their noses.
 At one point, two officers twist a woman's arm till she rises from the ground, her face wrenched in agony.
 In another scene, a young man winces as officers lead him along.
 The law enforcement name for these techniques is "pain-compliance." Police departments nationwide say it's a tried and true way to make uncooperative protesters cooperate.
