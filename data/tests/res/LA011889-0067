 The Los Angeles County district attorney's office and the FBI are investigating a videotaped incident in which a white Long Beach police officer appeared to shove a black man's face into a plate glass window after a routine traffic stop.
 If such an inquiry reveals that brutality was involved, either misdemeanor or felony charges could be filed against the officer, he said.
 The FBI has also been called in to determine whether the civil rights of the man who was arrested -- Don Jackson, a sergeant on administrative leave from the Hawthorne Police Department -- were violated during his altercation with two Long Beach officers on Pacific Coast Highway, spokesman Fred Reagan said.
 He refused to say who had requested the federal investigation. "We've had an allegation of a civil rights violation and we opened a ticket on it this morning," he said.
 Jackson and Jeff Hill, an off-duty federal corrections officer, donned dirty old clothes and drove into Long Beach in a rented 12-year-old sedan Saturday night as the television crew followed behind in a van.
