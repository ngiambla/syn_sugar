 LA011889-0067 6863 January 18, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition Metro; Part 2; Page 1; Column 6; Metro Desk 1177 words D.A., FBI TO INVESTIGATE LONG BEACH POLICE CASE By BETTINA BOXALL and CHRIS WOODYARD, Times Staff Writers The Los Angeles County district attorney's office and the FBI are investigating a videotaped incident in which a white Long Beach police officer appeared to shove a black man's face into a plate glass window after a routine traffic stop.
 Curt Livesay said the office was already looking into the case at the request of the Long Beach police chief. "We agreed to review the matter to determine whether a criminal investigation is appropriate," Livesay said, adding that his office hopes to decide by Friday whether a full-fledged investigation is merited.
 The FBI has also been called in to determine whether the civil rights of the man who was arrested -- Don Jackson, a sergeant on administrative leave from the Hawthorne Police Department -- were violated during his altercation with two Long Beach officers on Pacific Coast Highway, spokesman Fred Reagan said.
 Jackson and Jeff Hill, an off-duty federal corrections officer, donned dirty old clothes and drove into Long Beach in a rented 12-year-old sedan Saturday night as the television crew followed behind in a van.
