 Dell became interested in the concept after the 1977 Sycamore Canyon fire in which 200 homes were lost and only a shift in the wind prevented the loss of additional Santa Barbara residences.
 The concept behind the garden is that while no plant is fireproof, some are more flammable than others.
 The garden is landscaped into four plant zones, with the most flammable vegetation planted farthest from the house.
 Zone 1, closest to the residence, is a small area of plants that pose little risk of burning.
 A brochure available at the garden aids your exploration.
