 Dell became interested in the concept after the 1977 Sycamore Canyon fire in which 200 homes were lost and only a shift in the wind prevented the loss of additional Santa Barbara residences.
 After the fire, Dell began studying its effects. "Many of my clients lost property, but the fire jumped from house to house, then skipped others.
 I realized that the landscaping had a relationship to the amount of devastation." Dell, the Santa Barbara City Fire Department, the city government and a number of volunteers combined their efforts and began planning the Santa Barbara Firescapes Demonstration Garden to educate the public about reducing the risks of wildfire near their homes.
 The garden is a model of how to design and maintain landscaping around the home to provide a line of defense against fire.
 As Dell sees it, while many home gardeners have learned to deal with low-water conditions, they've virtually ignored another common Southern California occurrence -- wildfire.
