 Most Southern Californians would agree that hills and canyons are among the most desirable places to live.
 But these wild, yet settled, places at the edge of the metropolis -- what botanists sometimes call "the urban-chaparral interface" -- are the properties most threatened by wildfire.
 While little can be done to control the natural fires that occur in chaparral country, homeowners can change their approach to landscaping and help improve the chances of their homes and property surviving a brush fire. "The idea behind fire-resistant landscaping -- firescaping -- is to design landscaping to minimize the fire hazard," says Owen Dell, a Santa Barbara landscape contractor who has many canyon and hillside homeowners as clients.
 Dell became interested in the concept after the 1977 Sycamore Canyon fire in which 200 homes were lost and only a shift in the wind prevented the loss of additional Santa Barbara residences.
