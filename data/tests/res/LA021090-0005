 BUT THERE'S STILL THE SECOND AMENDMENT. </P> </HEADLINE> <BYLINE> <P> By MICHAEL KINSLEY, Michael Kinsley writes the TRB column for The New Republic. </P> </BYLINE> <TEXT> <P> Around the world, national theologies are crumbling: communism, apartheid and, here in America, the worship of guns -- to foreigners, the single craziest thing about us. </P> <P> Do you sense an outbreak of sanity about gun control?
 A Time Magazine/Cable News Network poll reports that 87% of gun owners themselves favor a seven-day waiting period for handgun purchases; three-quarters favor registration of semi-automatic weapons and handguns, and half favor registration of rifles and shotguns. </P> <P> Unfortunately, there is the Second Amendment to the Constitution: "A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed." </P> <P> Most right thinkers take comfort in that funny stuff about the militia.
 In the Supreme Court's one 20th-Century treatment of the Second Amendment, it held somewhat ambiguously in 1939 that sawed-off shotguns aren't necessarily protected by the Constitution without proof that they are the kind of weapon a militia might have used. </P> <P> Working from that decision and the common law, Kates says the amendment's protection should be limited to weapons "in common use among law-abiding people," useful for law enforcement or personal defense, and lineally descended from weapons known to the Framers. (No nuclear bombs.) He adds that they must be light enough for an ordinary person to carry ("bear"), and even that they can't be especially "dangerous or unusual." He says that the amendment places no limit on mandatory registration or laws against concealed weapons in public. </P> <P> This list seems quite reasonable and moderate, though where it all comes from is not clear.
