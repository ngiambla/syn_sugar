 According to Francis' testimony, Johnson said that an unidentified man who had been talking with Lewis sat near the beer that was provided for the athletes to facilitate them in providing urine samples.
 IAAF officials, however, said the record will stand because Johnson passed a drug test after the 1987 race. "If it has been proven that he took drugs, I would think that (withdrawing the record) is the responsible thing for the sport," Lewis said Sunday.
 According to testimony, since 1981 Johnson has taken such drugs as furazabol, stanozolol and the human growth hormone, which is taken from the pituitary glands of human cadavers or can be taken in synthetic form.
 The drugs induce the growth of muscle tissue, and some athletes claim, help performances. "He is trying to say that everyone was on it, so they got on it," Lewis said. "That's not true.
 That's why they got on drugs." Lewis said track and field is not infested with steroid users as some are beginning to believe in light of the Canadian inquiry.
