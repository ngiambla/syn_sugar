"How can anybody in the world do that after running all those rounds (preliminary heats)? </P> <P> "I said, 'Look, I don't know what he is taking or what he is doing, but he is doing something.' " </P> <P> Now Lewis has been implicated in an alleged sabotage of Johnson's drug test, which returned a positive result for the banned anabolic steroid stanozolol. </P> <P> At a Canadian inquiry into drug use in sport Monday at Toronto, Charlie Francis, a Canadian sprint coach, testified that Johnson might have drunk contaminated beer before a urinalysis.
 Francis based his theory on the fact that Johnson took the steroid furazabol three weeks before the Games, not the difficult-to-detect stanozolol. </P> <P> According to Francis' testimony, Johnson said that an unidentified man who had been talking with Lewis sat near the beer that was provided for the athletes to facilitate them in providing urine samples. </P> <P> Francis said that two witnesses told him that the stranger had spoken with Lewis in another area of the waiting room.
