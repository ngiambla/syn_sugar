 At a Canadian inquiry into drug use in sport Monday at Toronto, Charlie Francis, a Canadian sprint coach, testified that Johnson might have drunk contaminated beer before a urinalysis.
 Francis based his theory on the fact that Johnson took the steroid furazabol three weeks before the Games, not the difficult-to-detect stanozolol.
 According to Francis' testimony, Johnson said that an unidentified man who had been talking with Lewis sat near the beer that was provided for the athletes to facilitate them in providing urine samples.
 The drugs induce the growth of muscle tissue, and some athletes claim, help performances. "He is trying to say that everyone was on it, so they got on it," Lewis said. "That's not true.
 But it made me feel like I'm putting something back into track and field because I'm setting an example." Lewis called for Johnson to also become a role model. "I think Ben is 110% irresponsible in not coming out and telling kids to stay off drugs," he said. "He needs to stand up and say, 'Don't do it.
