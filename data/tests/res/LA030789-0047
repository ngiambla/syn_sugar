 According to Francis' testimony, Johnson said that an unidentified man who had been talking with Lewis sat near the beer that was provided for the athletes to facilitate them in providing urine samples.
 Lewis had finished second to Johnson, who set a world record of 9.79 seconds in winning the 100-meter gold medal, and subsequently also had to be tested. "Any allocation or innuendo that Carl Lewis tampered with Ben Johnson's drink or sample is ludicrous," said David Greifinger, Lewis' attorney. "These sound like the last acts of desperate men who know they've committed wrong and see no other way out other than to continue to lie and to fabricate stories. "Charlie and Ben should own up to the fact that what they did was wrong, and should promise to never to do it again and move on with their lives.
 IAAF officials, however, said the record will stand because Johnson passed a drug test after the 1987 race. "If it has been proven that he took drugs, I would think that (withdrawing the record) is the responsible thing for the sport," Lewis said Sunday.
 According to testimony, since 1981 Johnson has taken such drugs as furazabol, stanozolol and the human growth hormone, which is taken from the pituitary glands of human cadavers or can be taken in synthetic form.
 The drugs induce the growth of muscle tissue, and some athletes claim, help performances. "He is trying to say that everyone was on it, so they got on it," Lewis said. "That's not true.
 That's why they got on drugs." Lewis said track and field is not infested with steroid users as some are beginning to believe in light of the Canadian inquiry.
 Lewis and Ashford are teammates on the Santa Monica Track Club. "No way in the world does she take drugs," Lewis said, pounding a table. "She is a victim.
 Olympian said he was happy with his result. "I've come to grips with the fact that I'm the best I can be and I can't ask for anything more," he said. "I'm doing what is right.
 But it made me feel like I'm putting something back into track and field because I'm setting an example." Lewis called for Johnson to also become a role model. "I think Ben is 110% irresponsible in not coming out and telling kids to stay off drugs," he said. "He needs to stand up and say, 'Don't do it.
 You're trying to cheat somehow." Lewis, who won four gold medals at the 1984 Summer Games and has been one of the great sprinters and long jumpers in track and field, said he is determined to help the sport's image. "That's what people don't realize," he said. "I could leave it all alone but the thing is, I want track to be a better sport than when I came.
