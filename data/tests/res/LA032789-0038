 36272 March 27, 1989, Monday, Home Edition Part 1; Page 1; Column 2; National Desk 1282 words ALASKA TANKER PILOTED BY UNQUALIFIED OFFICER; EXXON UNABLE TO EXPLAIN CAPTAIN'S ABSENCE; RISING WINDS STIR FEARS OF OIL SLICK DAMAGE By TAMARA JONES, Times Staff Writer VALDEZ, Alaska An unqualified mate was piloting the Exxon Valdez -- violating both Coast Guard regulations and company policy -- when the tanker crashed into rocks, unleashing the worst oil spill in U.S. history, Exxon Shipping Co. said Sunday.
 Exxon also disclosed that the Long Beach-bound tanker actually was involved in two separate accidents that night in pristine Prince William Sound.

"The Coast Guard doesn't have tons and tons of its own equipment, and it would have to hire the same people Exxon has," Nelson said. "That would just slow things down. "Right now, Exxon is the oil company with the deep pockets, and it's cleaning up its own spill within federal guidelines."
