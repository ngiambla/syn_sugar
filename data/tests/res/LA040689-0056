 Exxon salvage crews successfully refloated the stricken tanker Exxon Valdez on Wednesday as the former captain of the vessel surrendered to authorities in New York to face criminal charges in the massive oil spill.
 Fired by Exxon After the Exxon Valdez ran aground on March 24, Hazelwood was found to be legally drunk and was fired by Exxon.
 President Bush earlier had sent a team of high-level officials to Valdez and determined that federal management of the cleanup was not necessary.
 We think the most effective and efficient way to carry out this project is (for Exxon) to continue," Beathard said.
 Oil flow from the North Slope had been cut by 60% because the spill restricted tanker traffic in Valdez harbor, but traffic has increased.
