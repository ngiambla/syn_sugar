 At the same time, it was disclosed that federal officials are probing the possibility that Exxon's 987-foot oil tanker was on autopilot shortly before it ran aground and that the electronic navigation aid confused the crew and contributed to the accident.
 In one proposed draft of an order, continuation of routine operations at the Alyeska Marine Terminal near the town of Valdez is described as creating "a substantial potential risk of additional oil spill" because the consortium has failed to demonstrate it can manage a large spill with minimal environmental effects.
 Installation of Booms -- The installation of containment booms around all oil tankers in the harbor. -- Permanent restriction of tanker traffic to daylight hours. -- A limit of one tanker being loaded at a time until all designated cleanup equipment is in place, and the end of all loading within 72 hours if cleanup equipment is not ready. -- Demonstration by April 30 of adequate gear and supplies to handle another 10-million-gallon spill.
 Meanwhile, the chairman of Exxon Corp. told Congress Thursday that the third mate who was on the bridge of the Exxon Valdez when it ran aground has told company lawyers that he turned off the ship's automatic pilot in an effort to avoid the reef. "My understanding is that he turned that computer off and it was not as if it hit the rocks on automatic pilot," Exxon Chairman Lawrence G.
 Tom Kilpatrick of the California Maritime Academy, a former captain himself, said autopilots take full control of a ship once they are switched on. "The helm will not respond if it's in autopilot," he said. "That should be the first clue to people on the bridge that the autopilot is on." A Coast Guard official in Anchorage said the third mate in charge of the tanker shortly before it went aground did complain of being unable to get the vessel to respond to the helm.
