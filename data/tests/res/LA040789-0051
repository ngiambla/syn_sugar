 At the same time, it was disclosed that federal officials are probing the possibility that Exxon's 987-foot oil tanker was on autopilot shortly before it ran aground and that the electronic navigation aid confused the crew and contributed to the accident.

 Installation of Booms -- The installation of containment booms around all oil tankers in the harbor. -- Permanent restriction of tanker traffic to daylight hours. -- A limit of one tanker being loaded at a time until all designated cleanup equipment is in place, and the end of all loading within 72 hours if cleanup equipment is not ready. -- Demonstration by April 30 of adequate gear and supplies to handle another 10-million-gallon spill.

A Coast Guard official in Anchorage said the third mate in charge of the tanker shortly before it went aground did complain of being unable to get the vessel to respond to the helm.
