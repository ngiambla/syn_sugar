 Steve Cowper on Thursday threatened to close down the trans-Alaska oil pipeline unless its owners meet his terms for improved safety and cleanup measures.
 An aide to the governor described the companies' response as "generally OK" but said that Cowper may issue an order putting his plan into effect anyway.
 In one proposed draft of an order, continuation of routine operations at the Alyeska Marine Terminal near the town of Valdez is described as creating "a substantial potential risk of additional oil spill" because the consortium has failed to demonstrate it can manage a large spill with minimal environmental effects.
 Installation of Booms -- The installation of containment booms around all oil tankers in the harbor. -- Permanent restriction of tanker traffic to daylight hours. -- A limit of one tanker being loaded at a time until all designated cleanup equipment is in place, and the end of all loading within 72 hours if cleanup equipment is not ready. -- Demonstration by April 30 of adequate gear and supplies to handle another 10-million-gallon spill.
 However, favorable winds were still keeping most of the crude offshore, he said.
