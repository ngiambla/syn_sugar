 Out of the horn of Africa has emerged the most devastating and dominant group of marathon runners the world has seen.
 It appears to be happening again, a generation after Abebe Bikila ran barefoot through the darkened streets of Rome in 1960 to win the first of his two Olympic golds.
 Now it is Abebe Mekonnen, who was born the year Bikila won the 1964 Olympic Marathon in Tokyo and a nation named its baby boys after its hero.
 But the story of Monday's 93rd Boston race was Mekonnen and his nation of 42 million, which has reemerged as a force to be reckoned with in marathon running.
 I just can't go on with my responsibilities as a wife and mother and spend this amount of time in physical therapy and training.
