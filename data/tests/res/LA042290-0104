 "Mad cow disease" has killed 10,000 cattle, restricted the export market for Britain's cattle industry and raised fears about the safety of eating beef.
 The suspicion is that the disease was transmitted through cattle feed, which used to contain sheep by-products as a protein supplement.
 Sheep offal is still used in pig and poultry feed.
 Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service in July banned imports of cattle, embryos and bull semen from Britain, said Margaret Webb, a USDA spokeswoman in Washington.
 The Southwood report said it is "most unlikely" that the disease poses a threat to humans.
