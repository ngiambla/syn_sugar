 "Mad cow disease" has killed 10,000 cattle, restricted the export market for Britain's cattle industry and raised fears about the safety of eating beef.
 The symptoms are very much like scrapie, a sheep disease which has been in Britain since the 1700s.
 The incurable disease eats holes in the brains of its victims; in late stages a sick animal may act skittish or stagger drunkenly.
 The government banned the use of sheep offal in cattle feed in June, 1988, and later banned the use of cattle brain, spleen, thymus, intestines and spinal cord in food for humans.
 The disease struck one of his own cows, Gourlay said. "In the course of 24 hours, the animal went from being ostensibly quite normal to very vicious and totally disoriented." As of Feb. 9, the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food said that 9,998 cattle have been destroyed after being diagnosed with BSE.
