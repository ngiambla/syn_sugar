 "Mad cow disease" has killed 10,000 cattle, restricted the export market for Britain's cattle industry and raised fears about the safety of eating beef.
 I have not changed my eating habits, but I certainly do wonder." Mad cow disease, or bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or BSE, was diagnosed only in 1986.
 The suspicion is that the disease was transmitted through cattle feed, which used to contain sheep by-products as a protein supplement.
 The government banned the use of sheep offal in cattle feed in June, 1988, and later banned the use of cattle brain, spleen, thymus, intestines and spinal cord in food for humans.
 Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service in July banned imports of cattle, embryos and bull semen from Britain, said Margaret Webb, a USDA spokeswoman in Washington.
