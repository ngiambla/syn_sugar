 The government insists that the disease poses only a remote risk to human health, but scientists still aren't certain what causes the disease or how it is transmitted. "I think everyone agrees that the risks are low," says Martin Raff, a neurobiologist at University College, London. "But they certainly are not zero.
 The government banned the use of sheep offal in cattle feed in June, 1988, and later banned the use of cattle brain, spleen, thymus, intestines and spinal cord in food for humans.
 In March, the government announced that it would pay farmers 100% of market value or average market price, whichever is less, for each animal diagnosed with BSE. "I think it is a recognition -- not just of pressure from farmers -- but that the public would feel more confident that no BSE-infected animal would ever be likely to go anywhere near the food chain if there was 100% compensation," said Sir Simon Gourlay, president of the National Farmers Union.
 The disease struck one of his own cows, Gourlay said. "In the course of 24 hours, the animal went from being ostensibly quite normal to very vicious and totally disoriented." As of Feb. 9, the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food said that 9,998 cattle have been destroyed after being diagnosed with BSE.
 David Maclean, a junior agriculture minister, has complained of "BSE hysteria" in the media and has insisted that the risk of the disease passing to humans is "remote." The government has committed $19 million to finding the cause of the disease.
 A commission chaired by Sir Richard Southwood, a professor at Oxford University, reported last year that the cause of BSE "is quite unlike any bacteria or known viruses." The report said the disease is impossible to detect in apparently healthy animals because it does not prompt the immune system to produce antibodies.
 According to a report in the British Medical Journal, the incidence of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease is no higher in Britain than it is in countries free of scrapie. "It is urgent that the same reassurance can be given about the lack of effect of BSE on human health," a consultative committee reported to the Agriculture Ministry.
