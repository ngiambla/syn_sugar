 Elizabeth Taylor is breathing with the assistance of a ventilator after undergoing surgery aimed at determining the cause of pneumonia that has kept her hospitalized for three weeks, her physicians said Monday.
 John's Hospital in Santa Monica last week for treatment of the pneumonia, and was listed in serious condition in the hospital's intensive-care unit on Monday, her doctors said in a prepared statement. "She is seriously ill and on Sunday underwent a lung biopsy to further determine the cause of her pneumonia," the physicians' statement said. "After surgery, her breathing is now being assisted by a ventilator. "Her condition is presently stabilizing, and her physicians are pleased with her progress." The statement provided no additional details of Taylor's condition, and hospital officials declined to comment beyond the statement.
 Taking a biopsy on the actress is called Sutton's law in medicine, after legendary holdup man Willie (the Actor) Sutton who said he robbed banks "because that's where the money is," said Dr.
 Mohler, a pulmonary disease specialist at the USC School of Medicine. "If you don't know what the trouble is, you grab a biopsy and study it, because that's where the problem is," Mohler explained. "The problem is not easily found another way. "You study the biopsy because that will dictate your therapy.
 It may just be a precautionary step in this case." Taylor, 58, entered Daniel Freeman Marina Hospital in Marina del Rey on April 10 suffering what her publicist then described as a "severe sinus infection." She was transferred to St.
 Patricia Murray, an infectious disease specialist, said in a statement last week that Taylor had pneumonia and was "being treated intravenously with antibiotics and will remain hospitalized (indefinitely)." Taylor has been plagued with health problems for years, particularly recurring back troubles that began with a fall from a horse during filming of the 1945 movie "National Velvet." In 1983, she acknowledged a 35-year addiction to sleeping pills and painkillers prescribed for a wide range of health problems.
