 Taylor, the first celebrity known to enter the Betty Ford clinic in Rancho Mirage, made a public example of her willingness to take on her addictions in two heavily publicized stays there.
 When Taylor first checked in, in 1983, she admitted to 35 years of addiction to pain killers and sleeping pills.
 I can almost see it, running like red water over the boulders in my pain-filled neck and shoulders, then through my ears and into my pounding head.
 Oh God, I am so, so tired." But the Betty Ford clinic encouraged Taylor only to fight the good fights that had brought her there, rather than take on all addictions -- to drugs and food -- at once.
 Taylor regained much of the weight, even though she took her drug problems in hand once again in a second stay at the Betty Ford clinic in 1988.
