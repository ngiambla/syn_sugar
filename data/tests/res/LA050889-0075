 The tendency is to want to finish the race as soon as possible and get a head start on recovering from it.
 Rex Wilson of New Zealand patiently waited for the lead pack to sort itself out, took the lead at 10 miles and rolled to a victory in 2 hours 12 minutes 27 seconds, a course record.
 Wen Yanmin, a 23-year-old student from Bejing, China, picked her way through a strung-out pack and out-kicked Laura Konatz of Toronto to win in 2:43:33, also a course record.
 But the mist burned off and the last eight miles -- the toughest portion of the marathon -- became even tougher.
 The refrain from the runners was, "It's not the heat, it's the humidity." The men's race was led at various times by a pack of about six runners.
 Viktor Gural of the Soviet Union, who had been among the leaders for most of the race, said he had trouble with everything.
 Samson Obwocha, a Kenyan who lives in Gardena, waited for Gural to fade and then made his move. "I saw him struggling and I knew I could outkick him," Obwocha said.
 Wilson also made a move, or more precisely, he continued his steady 5:03 mile pace while the rest of the field slowed from the early, faster pace. "I didn't really want to lead all the way," Wilson said. "But I wanted to run at 5-minute pace, so I had to lead." The strategy resulted in a personal best time in only his third marathon -- an event he dislikes. "I hate the marathon," Wilson, 28, said, sounding quite sensible. "At 21 miles I started to hurt.
 Guadalupe Roman of Mexico led through much of the race but lost ground steadily in the last five miles and finished sixth.
 Asked if she was ever aware of Yanmin during the race, Konatz laughed. "The marathon is an unpredictable event," she said. "I knew at 25 miles if someone had a good kick. . . . " Someone did.
