 While the fire-season announcement came only two to three weeks earlier than usual in the vulnerable foothills, it was a full two months ahead of schedule in the heavily wooded mountain terrain of Southern California's national forests. "The last really good rainfall was back in '82-83, so our brush really hasn't recuperated in seven years," said Gordon Rowley, a fire management specialist with the U.S.
 Forest Service. "Unless we get a hurricane or something -- and that's not very likely -- we're going to have a very bad year." Rowley said other Western states also are experiencing drought, "which means they won't be able to send us the firefighting forces they normally can deploy out here. . . .
 Scott Franklin, a vegetation management officer with the county Fire Department, said the dead trees and dry brush combine to form a fuel source so volatile that "any ignition now could become a major fire." Fire officials generally have responded to the threat with increased training and requests for federal money to pay for extra firefighting personnel.
