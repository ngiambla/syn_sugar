 Scott Franklin, a vegetation management officer with the county Fire Department, said the dead trees and dry brush combine to form a fuel source so volatile that "any ignition now could become a major fire." </P> <P> Fire officials generally have responded to the threat with increased training and requests for federal money to pay for extra firefighting personnel. </P> <P> Each densely thicketed acre of hillside chaparral contains about 60 tons of brush, he said, and that 60 tons has about the same fuel energy as 3,750 gallons of gasoline. </P> <P> "Then, if you put 80 m.p.h. winds -- the kind of Santa Anas we get in September -- behind all that, a fire can consume 100 acres a minute and keep right on going," Franklin said. "You're talking an energy release equivalent to several nuclear events, the energy of a number of Hiroshimas." </P> <P> The county Fire Department map shows that the most threatened residential areas include a number of hillside and canyon communities within the city of Los Angeles, including parts of Baldwin Hills, Hollywood, the Los Feliz district, Tarzana, Encino, Sherman Oaks, Sunland and Sylmar. </P> <P> Especially threatened suburban communities include portions of Rolling Hills, Rancho Palos Verdes, Beverly Hills, Glendale, Pasadena, Altadena, Arcadia, Monrovia, Bradbury, Duarte, Azusa, Glendora, Claremont and Whittier. </P> <P> Doug Allen, a fire prevention officer with the state Division of Forestry, said residents should clear tall grass, brush, trash, firewood and other combustibles at least 30 feet from any building. </P> <P> </P> <P> FIRE STRESS AREAS </P> <P> Map shows largely undeveloped land where dead brush and a lack of leaf moisture in live brush create high fire hazards.
