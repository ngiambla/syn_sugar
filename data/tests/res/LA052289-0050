 This has always been a land of stark contrasts and magnificent subtleties, never more so than in the aftermath of last summer's spectacular season of fire which scorched enough timber and meadow to rival Rhode Island in size.
 Arguments still rage over the impact of the fires on wildlife, the conduct of officials responsible for monitoring the blazes and the role of the media and others in creating an erroneous impression that a national treasure had somehow been reduced to cinders.
 If nothing else, said James Agee, a forest ecology specialist at the University of Washington, the furor raised by the fires should force environmentalists to temper their purist approach to park management.
 Tied to Neighbors But "parks can no longer be considered ecological and sociological islands," Agee told a conference of conservationists here over the weekend. "They are inextricably tied to their neighbors for better or worse." Some movement in that direction may already be under way.
 The edict applies to all but two parks in Florida. "With the exception of Big Cypress and the Everglades, we will be in full suppression mode," a park service spokesman explained.
 Eventually 25,000 firefighters were called in from around the nation and the bill for suppression efforts soared to $120 million, nearly 10 times the size of Yellowstone's annual operating budget.
 However, Marsha Karle, a spokeswoman for the park, said letters and calls logged by Yellowstone operators are about double their usual pace and the number of visitors entering the park so far this spring has been well above normal.
 We have the rare opportunity to witness wildlife regeneration on a scale rarely seen anywhere on Earth." A new $250,000 exhibit on fire ecology is under construction, as is a series of wayside exhibits describing various fire scenes.
 Yellowstone officials are making no apologies for their handling of the fires, which they contend was not only ecologically sound but also in concert with then existing park service regulations.
 Christensen, told a congressional hearing last January that he considered the fires to be both natural and beneficial to the Yellowstone environment. "Ecologists are in total agreement that wildfires were a natural part of the primeval North American landscape," Christensen testified. " . . .
