 Arguments still rage over the impact of the fires on wildlife, the conduct of officials responsible for monitoring the blazes and the role of the media and others in creating an erroneous impression that a national treasure had somehow been reduced to cinders.
 The edict applies to all but two parks in Florida. "With the exception of Big Cypress and the Everglades, we will be in full suppression mode," a park service spokesman explained.
 Eventually 25,000 firefighters were called in from around the nation and the bill for suppression efforts soared to $120 million, nearly 10 times the size of Yellowstone's annual operating budget.
 We have the rare opportunity to witness wildlife regeneration on a scale rarely seen anywhere on Earth." A new $250,000 exhibit on fire ecology is under construction, as is a series of wayside exhibits describing various fire scenes.
 Yellowstone officials are making no apologies for their handling of the fires, which they contend was not only ecologically sound but also in concert with then existing park service regulations.
