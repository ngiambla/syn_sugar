 "Mad cow" disease, an enigmatic nervous disorder that has killed thousands of cattle in Britain, is causing trade friction in Europe and is threatening the $3.7-billion British beef industry.
 Therefore, British officials believe, France and West Germany imposed the bans to protect their domestic sales. "It's totally unjustified and illegal," said Patrick Barrow, spokesman for the Meat and Livestock Commission, a trade organization.
 Although other countries have recently placed some restrictions on British beef and cattle, the French and German moves were the strongest by far.
 Mad cow disease has been responsible for the deaths of nearly 14,000 cows since it was first noticed in the mid-1980s.
 Although government and industry officials have been concerned for some time, mad cow disease did not become a household word until recently.
