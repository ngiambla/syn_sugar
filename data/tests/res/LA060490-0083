 "Mad cow" disease, an enigmatic nervous disorder that has killed thousands of cattle in Britain, is causing trade friction in Europe and is threatening the $3.7-billion British beef industry.
 British officials complain that the French and German import ban is a result of economic, not health, concerns.
 West Germany bought $50 million worth last year.
 Mad cow disease has been responsible for the deaths of nearly 14,000 cows since it was first noticed in the mid-1980s.
 But the prime suspect is tainted cow feed.
