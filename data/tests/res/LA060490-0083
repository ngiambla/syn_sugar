 On Friday, West Germany joined France in a ban on British beef imports, citing health fears related to the mysterious ailment, whose technical name is bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE).
 Therefore, British officials believe, France and West Germany imposed the bans to protect their domestic sales. "It's totally unjustified and illegal," said Patrick Barrow, spokesman for the Meat and Livestock Commission, a trade organization.
