 Ben Johnson should be stripped of his world record in the 100-meter dash and it should be awarded to Carl Lewis, many U.S. track and field officials and athletes said Wednesday in the aftermath of Johnson admitting to his steroid use.
 The possibility that Johnson could lose his record was raised when the IAAF asked for "an urgent legal opinion" to see what it could do about records and championships of confessed drug users.
 The issue would be decided at the IAAF Congress, scheduled for Barcelona, Spain, in September. "The . . . actions would allow the IAAF, if it so decided, retroactively to withdraw results obtained and any records achieved by such athletes," the statement said.
 Frank Greenberg, TAC president, said: "We'll wait to see what Canada does," following the country's inquiry at which 40 persons, among them Johnson, his coach, Charlie Francis, and his physician, Jamie Astaphan, testified. "I feel we will do our best to advocate that our athlete, Carl Lewis, gets the world record," Greenberg said.
 Lewis has the second-fastest legal time in history, 9.92, in finishing second to Johnson at last year's Seoul Olympics.
