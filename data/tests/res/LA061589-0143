 Ben Johnson should be stripped of his world record in the 100-meter dash and it should be awarded to Carl Lewis, many U.S. track and field officials and athletes said Wednesday in the aftermath of Johnson admitting to his steroid use.
 Johnson testified this week at a Canadian inquiry that his seven-year involvement with illegal performance-enhancing drugs included injections before the 1987 World Championships in Rome, where he set the existing world record of 9.83 seconds. "I would have to see the evidence, but if he was on drugs at the time of the World Championships, my thought would be to remove his record," said Ollan Cassell, executive director of The Athletics Congress, the national governing board for the sport.
 The issue would be decided at the IAAF Congress, scheduled for Barcelona, Spain, in September. "The . . . actions would allow the IAAF, if it so decided, retroactively to withdraw results obtained and any records achieved by such athletes," the statement said.
 Lewis thinks he should. "He went a long time without telling the truth, but he broke down and he has told the truth," said Lewis, a six-time Olympic gold medalist. "He is giving us an opportunity to believe him, to support him. "I even heard him speaking out against drugs and that's the important thing." Al Joyner, the 1984 Olympic gold medalist in the triple jump, said Johnson should be allowed to compete again, only because that is the rule. "But all his records should be taken because he admitted it," Joyner added. "He killed a lot of fans . . . a lot of young kids . . . and he almost killed our sport . . . he put a dark shadow over it . . . because of who he was," Joyner said.
