 Johnson testified this week at a Canadian inquiry that his seven-year involvement with illegal performance-enhancing drugs included injections before the 1987 World Championships in Rome, where he set the existing world record of 9.83 seconds. "I would have to see the evidence, but if he was on drugs at the time of the World Championships, my thought would be to remove his record," said Ollan Cassell, executive director of The Athletics Congress, the national governing board for the sport.
 Frank Greenberg, TAC president, said: "We'll wait to see what Canada does," following the country's inquiry at which 40 persons, among them Johnson, his coach, Charlie Francis, and his physician, Jamie Astaphan, testified. "I feel we will do our best to advocate that our athlete, Carl Lewis, gets the world record," Greenberg said.
 Lewis thinks he should. "He went a long time without telling the truth, but he broke down and he has told the truth," said Lewis, a six-time Olympic gold medalist. "He is giving us an opportunity to believe him, to support him. "I even heard him speaking out against drugs and that's the important thing." Al Joyner, the 1984 Olympic gold medalist in the triple jump, said Johnson should be allowed to compete again, only because that is the rule. "But all his records should be taken because he admitted it," Joyner added. "He killed a lot of fans . . . a lot of young kids . . . and he almost killed our sport . . . he put a dark shadow over it . . . because of who he was," Joyner said.
