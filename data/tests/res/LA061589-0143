 Ben Johnson should be stripped of his world record in the 100-meter dash and it should be awarded to Carl Lewis, many U.S. track and field officials and athletes said Wednesday in the aftermath of Johnson admitting to his steroid use.
 The possibility that Johnson could lose his record was raised when the IAAF asked for "an urgent legal opinion" to see what it could do about records and championships of confessed drug users.
 Lewis has the second-fastest legal time in history, 9.92, in finishing second to Johnson at last year's Seoul Olympics.
