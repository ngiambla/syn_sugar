 Firefighters got the upper hand Friday on an 8,200-acre brush fire in Cleveland National Forest that destroyed 11 structures near Lake Elsinore in Riverside County.
 They said the blaze resulted in more than $1.1 million damage to various structures in remote canyons and to the watershed that feeds Lake Elsinore.
 Four firefighters were injured fighting the blaze, one of them seriously, authorities said.
 Forest Service spokesman Robert Brady said the Antelope Valley fire was 100% contained at 8 a.m.
 Six structures were burned, including one home, and more than 1,000 people were forced to temporarily evacuate on Wednesday.
