 Firefighters got the upper hand Friday on an 8,200-acre brush fire in Cleveland National Forest that destroyed 11 structures near Lake Elsinore in Riverside County.
 Aided by higher humidity and a decrease in wind, fire crews had more than 85% of the blaze surrounded late Friday afternoon and began releasing many of the 2,300 people who had been fighting the fire.
 They said the blaze resulted in more than $1.1 million damage to various structures in remote canyons and to the watershed that feeds Lake Elsinore.
