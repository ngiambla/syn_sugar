 Fujita, 69, spends much of his time in his lab at the University of Chicago creating tornadoes for research.
 They're just like human beings: The rich may become richer and the poor may get poorer." Fujita also discovered that most strong tornadoes are actually six or seven small twisters he calls suction vortices, rotating around the center of a larger tornado. "A suction vortex can pick up a car or a small house or something, but when you're standing right next to it you can be completely safe." He has studied tornadoes that have dropped houses into lakes, made off with one car and left another right next to it untouched, and moved whole flocks of cows and sheep -- which lived through the experience.
