 LA071590-0068 247383 July 15, 1990, Sunday, Ventura County Edition Metro; Part B; Page 1; Column 5 1667 words 4 WHO CLAIM POLICE BEAT THEM WERE NOT CHARGED; OXNARD: THE PUBLIC DEFENDER'S OFFICE SAYS IT IS VERY UNUSUAL FOR THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE NOT TO PROSECUTE SUSPECTS ACCUSED OF CRIMES BY POLICE.
 By HUGO MARTIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER Over the past two years, the Ventura County district attorney's office in four separate incidents has declined to prosecute suspects who contended that they were victims of police brutality while being arrested for various offenses by Oxnard officers, records show.
 In a fifth and more recent incident, the district attorney's office declined to file a charge of assaulting an officer against an Oxnard man who says he and several other guests at a June 15 private party were beaten by Oxnard police.
 The suits, which seek unspecified damages and medical and legal expenses, are pending.
 In each of the four cases, Brodie said, his office did not prosecute because it found that police did not provide enough evidence to prove the charges "beyond a reasonable doubt." But Jean Farley, a supervisor for the Ventura County public defender's office, said it is extremely rare for the district attorney's office not to prosecute a suspect who is accused by police.
 He said, however, that the decisions by the district attorney's office not to prosecute the suspects do not reflect poorly on the department. "I don't think our reputation is any worse than any other department's," he said. "There is always going to be a disagreement over how much force is used." The latest incident involving an accusation of police brutality stemmed from the June 15 clash between 18 officers and about 12 party guests at a house in the 1300 block of South E Street.
 Cole's report said Gonzalez was found hiding in the parking lot and "was bit by a police service dog during the arrest." The report, however, does not say why the dog attacked Gonzalez or whether Gonzalez resisted arrest.
