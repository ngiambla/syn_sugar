 Dennis DeConcini (D-Ariz.). </P> <P> "We are petitioning to protest the semiautomatic gun-control bills before Congress," read the text above a fast-growing list of names. "If we allow the government to become involved in any type of gun control, we are violating a basic constitutional right, the right to keep and bear arms." </P> <P> The petitioners' target that sunny day last spring was DeConcini, a longtime opponent of gun-control measures who had suddenly switched sides, sponsoring one of the nine bills currently in Congress to ban the sale of assault weapons. "I'm a one-issue voter, and I'm going to do everything in my power to take DeConcini out," George Hiers, a burly man on crutches, vowed as he bought a semiautomatic shotgun for his wife to defend herself with while he's away on hunting trips. </P> <P> The attack on DeConcini was stirred up by the National Rifle Assn. in a display of fury that represented far more than retaliation against a former supporter.
 Long described as "the powerful gun lobby," the NRA is now scrambling to recover from stunning setbacks in the past three years.
 Although enjoying a membership surge, the NRA ran up a record $5.9-million deficit last year after spending more than $83 million. </P> <P> Thus, in fending off the assaults on assault weapons, the 118-year-old NRA is facing what its leaders call its most daunting challenge. </P> <P> "We're at a crossroads," James Jay Baker, the NRA's top congressional lobbyist, acknowledged as DeConcini's assault-weapons bill cleared its first Senate hurdle in April. "We're going to go down the road of either prohibitive firearms regulations or tough criminal justice provisions" -- that is, more prosecutors, penalties and prisons, the course sought by the NRA. "Once you get into a (gun-control) rut, it's tough to get out of that rut." </P> <P> Aside from the nation's capital, two of the hottest battlegrounds in the assault-weapons fight are Arizona and Florida.
 Write Today! </P> <P> AS PAT JONAS signed the petition in the gun store near Phoenix, one could witness the NRA's true political power: mobilizing citizens at the grass roots. "I don't want to see guns outlawed," Jonas said, "because I like to collect guns." Probably no other organization in the world floods government officials with as many phone calls, letters, telegrams and visits from its members as the NRA.
 Orasin, president of 15-year-old Handgun Control -- the NRA's chief nemesis -- estimates that as many as 500,000 members of the NRA and other gun groups regularly lobby elected officials and bureaucrats. </P> <P> The outpouring is prompted by red-alert mailings churned out by NRA leaders, all sounding essentially the same alarm: They're out to get your guns.
 These letters go not only to the NRA's 2.9 million members, whose $25 annual membership fee brings such benefits as a magazine, gun-theft insurance and safety instruction, but also to 10,000 affiliated hunting organizations and shooting-competition groups. </P> <P> Time and again, the NRA has proved that citizen action generated by such mailings can have far more effect on legislation than opinion polls, especially when a majority for gun control is relatively silent. "If a lawmaker is looking for an excuse to vote with the NRA, all he has to say is, 'I got a hundred calls from the NRA, but none from the other side,' " said a congressional aide.
 DeConcini's bill calls for a nationwide ban on sales of AK-47s and eight other semiautomatic rifles -- guns enjoying wide popularity because they have the menacing look and much of the firepower of fully automatic assault weapons used by the military and police. (Automatic guns fire 20 bullets or so per trigger pull; semiautomatics fire one bullet per trigger squeeze, but a fast index finger can get off as many as 20 shots in five seconds as ammunition is automatically reloaded from a clip.
 Aden believes that semiautomatic guns would come in handy if a Mexican revolution spilled over the border and Arizonans got caught in the cross fire. "You could defend your farm or your ranch fairly well," he said. </P> <P> Martin Mandall, a brash Scottsdale gun dealer who insisted that a reporter feel the thrill of firing Uzi and AK-47 machine guns at a range in his store basement, vowed during a conversation there to "work with the utmost severity to get DeConcini out of office." He said he had sold three years' stock of assault rifles in the two weeks after Bush issued a temporary import ban in March. </P> <P> "People are talking recall here," said Lee Echols, range master for the Phoenix Rod and Gun Club. "We stood behind DeConcini at the last election, and we feel he has completely betrayed us." Another member of the club, Bill Houston, telephoned DeConcini aide Matthew McCoy in his Washington office to protest.
 Now I'm going to be a gun-control advocate, and you're going to lose me.' " </P> <P> Later, he said at a Senate hearing on his bill: "By using these tactics, the NRA is succeeding only in alienating its friend closest to the fight." </P> <P> </P> <P> Foxes in the Henhouse </P> <P> AS THE NRA waged its war in the West, Marion P.
 Her gray slacks, blue ruffled blouse and blue suede jacket complemented her steel-blue eyes but belied her credentials: prize-winning marksman and hardball lobbyist for the Florida NRA. </P> <P> To her supporters, Hammer represents all that is strong about the NRA; to her detractors, much that is weak. </P> <P> Attacking the crux of the bill, Hammer told the subcommittee: "You cannot differentiate between semiautomatic firearms that look menacing and your routine sporting firearms because, functionally, they are the same." </P> <P> Next, she dealt acidly with one of the NRA's prickliest political problems: "There are some law-enforcement officers who are NRA members who are against us.
 It looked for all the world like Rambo's personal gun." Korologos asked the exhibitor, "Why are you ruining this perfectly legitimate rifle?" </P> <P> "Ah," came the response, "but they sell." </P> <P> Korologos commented: "Never mind it doesn't do us any good on Capitol Hill to have those damn things loose." </P> <P> An NRA operative conceded that, despite a tough "no-compromise" resolution unanimously adopted at the national convention, the NRA might have to back a compromise bill when Congress takes final action on assault weapons. "We may be branded as traitors, but that's the nature of the game in this town, to forge agreements and compromises," said the source, who requested anonymity. </P> <P> Actually, in the face of increasingly well-organized support for gun control, the NRA grudgingly compromised on cop-killer bullets in 1986 and plastic guns in 1988. </P> <P> To fight assault-weapon bills, Baker said, the NRA hopes to spend $5 million, most of it derived from direct-mail appeals.
 They marveled at new laser targeting devices that can project a red beam hundreds of feet, from gun to bull's-eye. </P> <P> And then, during a break, 1,000 NRA activists filed into a cavernous hall where Merrill L. (Pete) Petoskey, a wildlife biologist from Lewiston, Mich., delivered the opening prayer at the NRA's 118th annual meeting. </P> <P> "Dear God, Creator of all ... </P> <P> "Please give us the direction to make (gun-control advocates) understand that the actions of criminals, who should be confined, should not be dramatized into legislation that will impose on the rights of millions of law-abiding citizens to own and bear arms for lawful pursuits of recreation and self-defense. </P> <P> "Please help and guide the leaders of the National Rifle Association and of this nation to preserve and strengthen this freedom and this right. </P> <P> "Amen." </P> <P> Addressing the meeting, NRA President Foss acknowledged that the beleaguered group could, indeed, use more help.
