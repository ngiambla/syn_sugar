 Hurricane Chantal, the first of the season, aimed for the Texas and Louisiana coasts Monday, a day in which the storm's winds capsized an oil drilling work vessel and trapped as many as 10 crew members inside.
 Three of the crewmen were picked up by a nearby fishing vessel and a fourth was plucked from the water by a Coast Guard helicopter.
 But Coast Guard Petty Officer Bob Morehead said the search was called off in the late afternoon because winds were in excess of 60 m.p.h. and waves were at 12 feet and building.
 Shortly thereafter, the National Hurricane Center in Miami announced that Chantal was blowing at more than 74 m.p.h., strong enough to move it into the lowest hurricane classification, and the winds were later reported at 75 m.p.h.
 The 72-foot service vessel, leased to the Chevron Corp. by the Avis Bourg Co., capsized about 25 miles south of Morgan City, La.
 Bob Ebaugh, a weather specialist at the hurricane center, said 10 to 15 inches of rain was expected in southern Mississippi, Louisiana and East Texas.
 Meanwhile, coastal residents began what has long been a ritual along the Gulf Coast during hurricane season, which begins in late spring and runs through early fall.
 One particular concern in Houston was the possibility of major flooding should the city be on the wet, or eastern, side of the hurricane.
