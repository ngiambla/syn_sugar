 MICHAEL KENNEDY, Times Staff Writer HOUSTON Hurricane Chantal, the first of the season, aimed for the Texas and Louisiana coasts Monday, a day in which the storm's winds capsized an oil drilling work vessel and trapped as many as 10 crew members inside.
 Rescue divers, however, were unable to search the overturned service vessel for survivors because of increasingly strong winds and high waves.
