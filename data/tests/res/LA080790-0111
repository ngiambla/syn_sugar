"This happened to Joe Morgan, but it really is applicable to any black person who uses Los Angeles airport," said Oakland attorney Edwin Wilson Jr., who also is black. "If it wasn't Joe, this could have happened to me or my father or to any other black person." Searle, 42, denied the allegations but told The Times he could not discuss specifics of the case. "All I can say is that the guy is a great baseball player and appears to be a good announcer," Searle said. "I wish it didn't happen.
