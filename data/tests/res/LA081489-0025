 U.S. military helicopters on Sunday located the wreckage of a plane that crashed last Monday with Texas congressman Mickey Leland and 15 others aboard.
 U.S. rescue and recovery teams said that the plane hit a mountain about 4,300 feet above sea level, having missed clearing the peak by about 300 feet.
 The 44-year-old Leland, a Democrat, was making his sixth tour of refugee camps along the Ethiopia-Sudan border as chairman of the House Select Committee on Hunger, a panel he had helped to establish five years ago.

 Discovery of the crash site ended what had been one of the most extensive American search and rescue operations ever conducted in a Third World country.
 The search on Sunday was hampered again by thunderstorms, poor visibility and other conditions that characterized many of the previous days of search. "The terrain was fairly rugged and the weather conditions were bad getting there," said Capt.
 The crash site was described by U.S. authorities as being about 20 nautical miles due east of the town of Gambela and 230 nautical miles west-southwest of Addis Ababa.
 Area Had Been Covered The area of the site had apparently been searched within the first two days after the crash by American aircraft using electronic devices in an attempt to detect an emergency signal from the downed craft.
 Wheat, who was among those who had pressed Defense Department officials for the deployment of more aircraft in the search, said after the discovery Sunday: "We could have brought every plane in the world that we have, and it would not have made a difference." President Bush, in his Sunday statement, said: "I have known, admired and worked with Mickey Leland for many years.
 Baker III praised the congressman as "an outstanding statesman and humanitarian who died serving his country." Baker also thanked Ethiopia, a Soviet-allied country with which Washington has had strained relations for several years, for its "outstanding support" in the search for Leland's party.
