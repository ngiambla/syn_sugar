 U.S. military helicopters on Sunday located the wreckage of a plane that crashed last Monday with Texas congressman Mickey Leland and 15 others aboard.
 U.S. rescue and recovery teams said that the plane hit a mountain about 4,300 feet above sea level, having missed clearing the peak by about 300 feet.
 Ivan Tillen, a New York businessman and friend of Leland's; Robert Woods, a political and economic officer at the American Embassy in Addis Ababa; Gladys Gilbert, a special projects officer for the mission of the U.S.
 The search on Sunday was hampered again by thunderstorms, poor visibility and other conditions that characterized many of the previous days of search. "The terrain was fairly rugged and the weather conditions were bad getting there," said Capt.
 Wheat, who was among those who had pressed Defense Department officials for the deployment of more aircraft in the search, said after the discovery Sunday: "We could have brought every plane in the world that we have, and it would not have made a difference." President Bush, in his Sunday statement, said: "I have known, admired and worked with Mickey Leland for many years.
