 Presently, the crew found an Ethiopian surveyor who said he could guide them to an area near where the plane had been heard.
 The location was described as very steep, with the plane resting on land that was pitched at an angle of about 60 degrees. 'Mostly Rocks and Brush' Crew members described the site as "mostly rocks and brush" and indicated that the pilot of Leland's plane may have been trying to escape bad weather on Monday by following the pathway of a river flowing through a valley.
 The crash site was described by U.S. authorities as being about 20 nautical miles due east of the town of Gambela and 230 nautical miles west-southwest of Addis Ababa.
 Area Had Been Covered The area of the site had apparently been searched within the first two days after the crash by American aircraft using electronic devices in an attempt to detect an emergency signal from the downed craft.
 Wheat, who was among those who had pressed Defense Department officials for the deployment of more aircraft in the search, said after the discovery Sunday: "We could have brought every plane in the world that we have, and it would not have made a difference." President Bush, in his Sunday statement, said: "I have known, admired and worked with Mickey Leland for many years.
