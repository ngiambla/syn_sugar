 HILTZIK, Times Staff Writer </P> </BYLINE> <DATELINE> <P> ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia </P> </DATELINE> <TEXT> <P> U.S. military helicopters on Sunday located the wreckage of a plane that crashed last Monday with Texas congressman Mickey Leland and 15 others aboard.
 Witnesses who visited the site said there were no survivors. </P> <P> U.S. rescue and recovery teams said that the plane hit a mountain about 4,300 feet above sea level, having missed clearing the peak by about 300 feet.
 The crash site is about 75 miles east of the Fugnido refugee camp that Leland was flying to visit when the plane vanished in heavy weather last Monday. </P> <P> "If they would have flown over that peak they would have been home free," said Rep.
 Ackerman said that the plane appeared to have hit "nose first, right into the rocks; its two wings sheared off, its engines melted, its fuselage gone." </P> <P> </P> <P> Wreckage Examined </P> <P> Ackerman said that military paratroopers lowered themselves from his helicopter on ropes to examine the wreckage. </P> <P> "They told us everyone had died instantaneously," Ackerman said. </P> <P> The 44-year-old Leland, a Democrat, was making his sixth tour of refugee camps along the Ethiopia-Sudan border as chairman of the House Select Committee on Hunger, a panel he had helped to establish five years ago. </P> <P> Also aboard the plane were Hugh Anderson Johnson Jr. and Patrice Yvonne Johnson, both aides to Leland (who were not related); Joyce Francine Williams, an aide to Rep.
 Agency for International Development attached to the embassy; Thomas Worrick, the acting AID representative in Ethiopia, and Worrick's wife, Roberta. </P> <P> </P> <P> 7 Ethiopians Killed </P> <P> Also on board were Debebe Agonofer, an Ethiopian agricultural economist with the AID mission, and six other Ethiopians, including the plane's crew of three. </P> <P> Reaction to the news in the United States was one of sadness coupled with an outpouring of praise for Leland's work.
 A statement issued by President Bush said that "Mickey Leland and the other members of his traveling party, both Americans and Ethiopians, were engaged in a noble cause -- trying to feed the hungry." </P> <P> Dellums spoke of his staff aide who lost her life in the crash as "a close personal friend for over a decade" and said that everyone on the plane "shared a common commitment to helping the poor, the starving and the dispossessed in that war-torn, drought-stricken land." </P> <P> "Their deaths are a collective loss to all humanity," Dellums said. </P> <P> Discovery of the crash site ended what had been one of the most extensive American search and rescue operations ever conducted in a Third World country.
 Gilk, commander of one of the two helicopters that were the first to spot the wreckage. </P> <P> Gilk said that the crash site, in a mountainous and heavily wooded region, is so remote and inaccessible that the nearest landing site for helicopters is half a mile away, a distance that he said could take as much as three hours to cover on foot. </P> <P> </P> <P> Recovery Planned for Today </P> <P> Air Force personnel were assigned to remain near the site Sunday night to keep it secure.
