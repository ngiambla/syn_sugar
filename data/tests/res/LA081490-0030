 Combined, the researchers tested the lungs of more than 100 California wildland firefighters before and after the 1988 and 1989 fire seasons. </P> <P> Health experts also suspect that exposure to wildfire smoke may accelerate aging, prompt fatal heart attacks or cancer and trigger respiratory diseases such as chronic bronchitis or asthma. </P> <P> "After fires, they cough up black gunk.
 Its four-year drought has turned grasslands tinder dry, and its stagnant weather conditions and topography can trap smoke for days. </P> <P> Furthermore, forestry officials predict that the region's 1990 fire season will be devastating. </P> <P> The Yosemite fires, which have scorched more than 15,000 acres and are still out of control, and the recent Santa Barbara and Glendale fires, which destroyed nearly 500 homes, are only the largest of hundreds of blazes in the state. </P> <P> "We've got lots of summer ahead of us and we've already burned 600 or 700 structures," said Deputy Chief Keith Metcalfe of the state's southern regional firefighting crew in Riverside. " . . .
 Forest Service and state and county fire officials have been unable to protect their wildfire crews because they know of no gear light enough for firefighters to wear while hiking miles in burning terrain or effective enough to filter out the wide variety of toxic materials in smoke. </P> <P> Furthermore, developing protection for the crews has gotten little attention and virtually no state or federal funding. </P> <P> National fire officials say they cannot get help from Congress unless they can prove firefighters are dropping dead.
 The researchers said they have not determined if the lungs heal between seasons or if the damage accumulates. </P> <P> The California health department's tests on 63 firefighters showed they lost as much as 10% of their lung capacity during one six-month fire season, with an average loss of 4%. </P> <P> For many firefighters, the lung congestion turns into bronchitis or walking pneumonia three times a year, said Linane, 46, who has fought wildfires for 28 years. </P> <P> "You take antibiotics and it eventually goes away," Linane said. "But then it comes back.
 John Balmes, a pulmonary specialist and occupational health expert at UC San Francisco who helped with the state's study. </P> <P> Harrison said the forestry agencies and fire departments should at least warn their crews -- and potential recruits -- of the danger and consider rotating shifts more often to reduce smoke exposure. </P> <P> Although the findings of the national studies have not yet been published, word has spread to top officials in the state Forestry Department, who say they are now starting to search for protection for the agency's 3,500 full-time firefighters and about 2,000 seasonal ones. </P> <P> "I don't want to wait for firefighters to die," said Jack Wiest, the department's chief of fire planning and research. "We have to get on this right now." </P> <P> Part of the solution is to develop lightweight and long-lasting respirators. </P> <P> Air tanks and masks that are standard for fighting structural fires weigh 40 pounds and last only 15 to 30 minutes, so they are impractical for wildfire crews that hike miles carrying as much as 60 pounds of hoses and tools. </P> <P> Developing technology, however, takes money, and none has been allocated by California forestry officials. </P> <P> "Respiratory protection for wildland firefighters is non-existent.
