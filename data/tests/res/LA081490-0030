 The 80,000 men and women who battle the nation's wildfires have always known their lives were endangered by flames or heat or falling debris.
 But now, two new studies show they also face an unseen hazard: Their health is under siege from the poisonous stew of gases and soot in wildfire smoke.
 Combined, the researchers tested the lungs of more than 100 California wildland firefighters before and after the 1988 and 1989 fire seasons.
 Forest Service and state and county fire officials have been unable to protect their wildfire crews because they know of no gear light enough for firefighters to wear while hiking miles in burning terrain or effective enough to filter out the wide variety of toxic materials in smoke.
 The California health department's tests on 63 firefighters showed they lost as much as 10% of their lung capacity during one six-month fire season, with an average loss of 4%.
 But he didn't know he would feel sicker and sicker every year. "The doctor told me I look like I've smoked 10 packs of cigarettes a day all my life.
 Harrison said the forestry agencies and fire departments should at least warn their crews -- and potential recruits -- of the danger and consider rotating shifts more often to reduce smoke exposure.
 His group, which includes all federal and state agencies involved in wildland firefighting, now gets less than half the research money it received 15 to 20 years ago.
 Immediately after the 1987 fires, Ford and other researchers from Johns Hopkins and the California health department mounted studies. "It's the old cliche of how you don't put up that traffic signal at a dangerous intersection until there's a lot of people killed," Wiest said.
 But when I retire and I'm coughing and gagging, it may be another story. "The doctor here recommended that I take full pulmonary tests.
