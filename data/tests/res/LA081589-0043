 Freshman congressman Larkin Smith (R-Miss.) died in a light plane crash in Mississippi, authorities said Monday, making him the second member of the House killed in an aviation accident in a week.
 The single-engine Cessna 177 crashed Sunday night in thick woods near the tiny community of Janice.
 Smith and the pilot, Charles Vierling, who also was killed, were flying from Hattiesburg to Gulfport, according to federal and local officials.
 Searchers combed the heavily wooded DeSoto National Forest through the night but were unable to find the wreckage until Monday morning, when they spotted it from the air. "There was a 300-foot-long path cut by the plane," Harrison County Sheriff's Department Capt.
 Trent Lott (R-Miss.), "was just beginning a promising career in the Congress." Smith, a former sheriff and police chief, was already developing a reputation on the House Judiciary Committee as a zealous opponent of illegal drugs. "We (the congressional delegation) had come to depend on him in the fight against drugs," said Rep.
