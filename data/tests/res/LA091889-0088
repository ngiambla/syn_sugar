 The cash drain has been growing steadily since 1984, when it was $10.2 billion.
 The bank also reported that, despite the relatively buoyant economic growth in most industrial countries, developing countries turned in a decidedly mixed performance, ranging from a mini-boom in Southeast Asian economies to further impoverishment in Africa.
 The figures on the cash drain showed that these "net resource transfers," as the bank parlance terms them, are mushrooming rapidly -- a measure of the mounting strain that the global debt burden is placing on Third World economies.
 The total debt burden of Third World countries currently is estimated at about $993 billion.
 The net cash drain from the debtor countries to the richer ones began in 1984.
