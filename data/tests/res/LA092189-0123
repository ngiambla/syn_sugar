 The French Foreign Ministry declined to comment Wednesday about the possibility of a terrorist attack. "The pieces are widely scattered, so it didn't crash on impact," a Foreign Ministry spokesman said.
 According to one well-informed intelligence official, both French and American officials took that threat seriously and searched all the luggage on the plane before allowing it to depart.
