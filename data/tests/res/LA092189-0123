 A French DC-10 jetliner with 171 people aboard experienced a powerful high-altitude explosion, possibly from a terrorist bomb, before crashing in a remote desert region of Niger in northern Africa, officials in France said Wednesday.
 The French Foreign Ministry declined to comment Wednesday about the possibility of a terrorist attack. "The pieces are widely scattered, so it didn't crash on impact," a Foreign Ministry spokesman said.
 At the White House, Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said the U.S. government's information on Tuesday's disaster was limited. "We can't at this time state for a fact that (the plane) was blown up, but it does have those appearances," he said.
 He noted that by the end of August, "all the main Shiite players in Lebanon had threatened some sort of retribution against France." Threats by Militants On Aug. 20, the Revolutionary Justice Organization threatened to "strike deep into the heart of French territory." Three days later, Hezbollah threatened to stage suicide attacks against French targets.
 On Aug. 25, a previously unknown group, the Organization in Defense of the Oppressed, threatened to strike "at French interests everywhere." An Air France flight on Aug. 28 was delayed for more than five hours before taking off from Dulles International Airport in Washington when security officials received a last-minute bomb threat.
 According to one well-informed intelligence official, both French and American officials took that threat seriously and searched all the luggage on the plane before allowing it to depart.
 While France's willingness to bargain with terrorists for the freedom of hostages had in the past created a modus vivendi that appeared to spare the country from violent attacks, Hoffman and other analysts suggested that the stakes in Lebanon had become too important for those old rules to apply. "In these people's eyes, we're really talking about Lebanon's future.
 Another analyst at the center, Robert Kupperman, discounted the possibility that a small terrorist group alone could have been responsible for the airborne bombing. "When someone puts a bomb on the plane, it normally takes the resources of a state, at least to set it up," Kupperman said.
 The waiting room at Paris' Charles De Gaulle Airport, where the flight was scheduled to land, was tense and somber after the plane was first reported missing Tuesday night.
 The ambassador's wife, who was born in Los Angeles in the 1920s and later moved to the Imperial Valley, had decided to travel ahead of her husband to help plan the October wedding of their 26-year-old daughter Anne in suburban Washington, D.C.
