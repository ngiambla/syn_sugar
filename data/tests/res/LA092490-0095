 It has been two years since Johnson, then world record-holder at 100 meters, was stripped of his gold medal after testing positive for anabolic steroids at the Seoul Olympics.
 Al Franken, promoter of the Sunkist Invitational, is close to signing Johnson for his Jan. 18 meet, saying Johnson will receive the highest appearance fee Franken has ever paid -- $30,000, compared to the $23,000 Franken paid Carl Lewis.
 And there is a bonus in the contract that rewards Johnson for high attendance figures. "I think honestly, you have to figure that a lot of it is curiosity," Franken said. "You'll get people who don't care about track, and you may attract back people who have quit coming to track.
 Johnson reportedly will be paid $10,000 (Canadian) for the meet in Hamilton, a figure that has caused some jealousy among his peers.
 He has been an outspoken opponent of drug use and has spent the last year speaking to children, warning them against performance-enhancing drugs.
