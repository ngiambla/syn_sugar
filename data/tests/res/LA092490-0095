 It has been two years since Johnson, then world record-holder at 100 meters, was stripped of his gold medal after testing positive for anabolic steroids at the Seoul Olympics.
 Al Franken, promoter of the Sunkist Invitational, is close to signing Johnson for his Jan. 18 meet, saying Johnson will receive the highest appearance fee Franken has ever paid -- $30,000, compared to the $23,000 Franken paid Carl Lewis.
 And there is a bonus in the contract that rewards Johnson for high attendance figures. "I think honestly, you have to figure that a lot of it is curiosity," Franken said. "You'll get people who don't care about track, and you may attract back people who have quit coming to track.
 But American meet directors say they can't pay that kind of money, especially for an unproven runner.

 That may go a long way to easing Johnson back into a sport that disowned him almost as swiftly as he burst on the scene.
 Not only did he have to give back the gold medal, but he lost two world records, causing the sport to change its rules in order to take them.
