 By JULIE CART, TIMES STAFF WRITER It was a scene that recalled the golden days for Ben Johnson.
 It has been two years since Johnson, then world record-holder at 100 meters, was stripped of his gold medal after testing positive for anabolic steroids at the Seoul Olympics.
 Johnson was also suspended from competition for two years; that suspension ends today.
 And so the questions begin: What can Johnson do when not assisted by performance-enhancing drugs? "Once he returns to the sport, and if he returns a winner, all is forgiven," said Paul Gaines, assistant meet director for the Hamilton Spectator Indoor Games, the Canadian meet to be held Jan. 11 that will mark Johnson's return to competition. "I think that is the attitude the public will display.
 With the humility and shame that has been reflected on him, people tend to be more open minded about it.
 Charlie Francis, who coached Johnson for 12 years, estimated that steroids made Johnson faster by one meter.
 You're only as good as your last race, and the fans know that." Howard Schmertz of the Millrose Games in New York has an interest in Johnson, but perhaps not the budget. "There is a lot of interest in seeing whether this fellow is a truly great runner or if he is what Carl Lewis said he is, a fair runner who got there by taking drugs," Schmertz said. "I have no way of knowing.
 Right now, I can't think of anybody who would arouse as much interest as Ben Johnson." It would be ironic if Johnson becomes the star who revitalizes indoor track and field after being blamed for the steady decline of sponsor interest in outdoor track. "There has been damage to the sport and people want to blame Ben personally for that damage," Gaines said. "We are very cognizant of the fact that people are looking upon his return with something like skepticism and animosity.
 I can't say that it's wrong, especially when deep down I know Johnson's not the only one who's ever taken drugs." One thing that may not happen is a much-discussed lucrative match race between Johnson and Lewis. "I will never allow it to happen," Primo Nebiolo, president of the International Amateur Atheltic Federation, said Sunday. "We do not allow two-horse races." A NEW CAST Johnson, 28, has passed at least four drug tests during his suspension.
