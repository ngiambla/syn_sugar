 By JULIE CART, TIMES STAFF WRITER It was a scene that recalled the golden days for Ben Johnson.
 It has been two years since Johnson, then world record-holder at 100 meters, was stripped of his gold medal after testing positive for anabolic steroids at the Seoul Olympics.
 And so the questions begin: What can Johnson do when not assisted by performance-enhancing drugs? "Once he returns to the sport, and if he returns a winner, all is forgiven," said Paul Gaines, assistant meet director for the Hamilton Spectator Indoor Games, the Canadian meet to be held Jan. 11 that will mark Johnson's return to competition. "I think that is the attitude the public will display.
 You hear grumblings among media types and in some circles of the sport, but you have to give the guy the benefit of the doubt. "When this happened, it was a bitter disappointment for everyone in the sport to acknowledge that the No. 1 athlete in the sport was using drugs.
 Charlie Francis, who coached Johnson for 12 years, estimated that steroids made Johnson faster by one meter.
 And there is a bonus in the contract that rewards Johnson for high attendance figures. "I think honestly, you have to figure that a lot of it is curiosity," Franken said. "You'll get people who don't care about track, and you may attract back people who have quit coming to track.
 But American meet directors say they can't pay that kind of money, especially for an unproven runner. "If he's eligible to compete, to me, Ben Johnson is an attraction," said Ray Lumpp, meet director for the indoor meet at the Meadowlands in East Rutherford, N.J.. "I'd like to have Ben Johnson regardless of how he runs.
 You're only as good as your last race, and the fans know that." Howard Schmertz of the Millrose Games in New York has an interest in Johnson, but perhaps not the budget. "There is a lot of interest in seeing whether this fellow is a truly great runner or if he is what Carl Lewis said he is, a fair runner who got there by taking drugs," Schmertz said. "I have no way of knowing.
 Right now, I can't think of anybody who would arouse as much interest as Ben Johnson." It would be ironic if Johnson becomes the star who revitalizes indoor track and field after being blamed for the steady decline of sponsor interest in outdoor track. "There has been damage to the sport and people want to blame Ben personally for that damage," Gaines said. "We are very cognizant of the fact that people are looking upon his return with something like skepticism and animosity.
