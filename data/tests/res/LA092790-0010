 Proposals to limit the terms of members of Congress and of state legislators are popular and getting more so, according to the pundits and the polls.
 Veteran members -- proven vote-getters -- are much more powerful in relation to special interests than candidates who have to prove themselves in an uncertain and expensive campaign environment.
 Term limitations just shift power from elected officials to the relatively inaccessible officials, bureaucrats and influence peddlers who surround them.
 Of course we should pay attention to the quality of our legislators and vote against those whose performance we find wanting.
 Why are we so certain that voters have such terrible judgment that they need a constitutional restriction keeping them from voting for incumbents they know and like?
