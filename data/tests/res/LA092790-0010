 Proposals to limit the terms of members of Congress and of state legislators are popular and getting more so, according to the pundits and the polls.
 Veteran members -- proven vote-getters -- are much more powerful in relation to special interests than candidates who have to prove themselves in an uncertain and expensive campaign environment.
 Term limitations just shift power from elected officials to the relatively inaccessible officials, bureaucrats and influence peddlers who surround them.
 Why are we so certain that voters have such terrible judgment that they need a constitutional restriction keeping them from voting for incumbents they know and like?
 More likely, groups and interests that now have a hard time winning against incumbents are seeking term limitations to improve their chances of winning office.
