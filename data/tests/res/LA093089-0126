 In a blow to California and other states with large immigrant populations, the Senate voted Friday to bar the Census Bureau from counting illegal aliens in the 1990 population count. "I'm stunned," said Santa Ana City Council member Miguel A.
 Pulido and other Santa Ana council members say that the 1980 census substantially under-counted its population at 215,000.
 The city has been lobbying hard to have its illegal alien population -- estimated at 50,000 -- included in the 1990 count.
 The Senate's action came on a voice vote, despite arguments from the Bush Administration and other opponents that it is both unconstitutional and unworkable.
 Thad Cochran (R-Miss.) said that Georgia and Indiana both lost House seats after the 1980 Census, and that California and New York -- centers of illegal immigration -- each gained seats. "The bottom line is illegal aliens ought to be deported, not counted," Cochran said.
