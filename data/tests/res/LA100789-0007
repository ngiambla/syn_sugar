 This is not an argument regarding the merits of gun control laws.
 Second Amendment states (1791): "A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed." As often happens in law, a simple English sentence may have legal significance which determines the application of the words.
 The Second Amendment was, as was the rest of the first 10 amendments (the Bill of Rights), insisted upon by some of the states for their own protection from the federal government.
