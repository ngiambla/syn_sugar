 Consuelo and Abuelita aren't actual people, but their story nevertheless is played over and over again among the more than 3 million Latinos in the Los Angeles metropolitan area, health officials say.
 That is why the American Diabetes Assn. and other health education groups in the Los Angeles area and California have begun a major push to educate Latinos about diabetes.
 The effort is being aided by interested physicians and by drug companies, which make insulin and other drugs used for diabetes that can't be controlled by changes in eating habits.
 Being 20% or more overweight is one of the major diabetes risk factors. "We need to get into the communities and start teaching the kids and the adolescents and the parents to make some changes in their habits," said Dr.
 Jaime Davidson, a Dallas physician who has spearheaded the diabetes association's Latino education efforts. "Many people think that when Latinos come here (to the United States) they gain weight because they continue to eat the way they ate at home.
 If you have already a predisposed group of people, such as the Latinos, you get more obesity and you get more diabetes." With funding from Upjohn Co., the Los Angeles chapter of the American Diabetes Assn. sponsored a diabetes health fair at Olvera Street Plaza on Aug. 26.
 But, because it progresses slowly, Type II diabetes can go undiagnosed for years, allowing complications such as kidney failure, heart disease, blindness and the need for amputation of a foot or toe.
 That means adapting an Anglo-oriented health education network to the needs of a diverse Latino community that has a different social structure, health beliefs and eating habits from the majority culture.
 Recent immigrants and even some longtime U.S. residents are not likely to want to switch completely away from a diet reliant on beans, tortillas and other carbohydrates, Montoro noted, but modifications can be made easily.
 For instance, eat one tortilla instad of three * Cut down on fats -- broil meat instead of frying it, remove chicken skin before cooking it, don't put bacon or chorizo in beans, don't fry tortillas for enchiladas or tacos * Eat more fruits and vegetables * Get regular exercise.
