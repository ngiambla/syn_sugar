 The U.N. agency, in its first comprehensive look at global tuberculosis in a decade, said the disease kills nearly 3 million people a year, most of them between the ages of 15 and 59, "the segment of the population that is economically most productive." WHO attributed the sharp rise in part to the growing AIDS epidemic.
 It estimated that about 3 million people worldwide are dually infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which causes AIDS, and tuberculosis. "It is becoming a parallel epidemic, and it is this trend that has public health officials worried," Dr.
 The agency estimated that between 15 million and 20 million adults will be infected with HIV by the year 2000, and it predicted that the number of cases and deaths from tuberculosis will rise sharply as a result, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America and Southeast Asia. "These new data have been stunning to everyone, because an awful lot of people had thought that tuberculosis had gone away," said Dr.
