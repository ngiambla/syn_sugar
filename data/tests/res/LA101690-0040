 Tuberculosis has become the world's deadliest infectious disease, and the toll could soon rise even more dramatically if controls are not initiated quickly, the World Health Organization said Monday.

 The agency estimated that between 15 million and 20 million adults will be infected with HIV by the year 2000, and it predicted that the number of cases and deaths from tuberculosis will rise sharply as a result, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America and Southeast Asia. "These new data have been stunning to everyone, because an awful lot of people had thought that tuberculosis had gone away," said Dr.
 Tuberculosis is a highly communicable disease of the lungs and other organs caused by a bacterium transmitted through the air when infected people cough or sneeze.
 This is what is happening in developing nations, where the AIDS epidemic is raging. "In many places, more than half the beds in medical wards are patients with tuberculosis," Bloom said. "Many of these people do, in fact, die of AIDS.
