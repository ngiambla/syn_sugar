 Tuberculosis has become the world's deadliest infectious disease, and the toll could soon rise even more dramatically if controls are not initiated quickly, the World Health Organization said Monday.
 The U.N. agency, in its first comprehensive look at global tuberculosis in a decade, said the disease kills nearly 3 million people a year, most of them between the ages of 15 and 59, "the segment of the population that is economically most productive." WHO attributed the sharp rise in part to the growing AIDS epidemic.
 It estimated that about 3 million people worldwide are dually infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which causes AIDS, and tuberculosis. "It is becoming a parallel epidemic, and it is this trend that has public health officials worried," Dr.
 The agency estimated that between 15 million and 20 million adults will be infected with HIV by the year 2000, and it predicted that the number of cases and deaths from tuberculosis will rise sharply as a result, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America and Southeast Asia. "These new data have been stunning to everyone, because an awful lot of people had thought that tuberculosis had gone away," said Dr.
 Tuberculosis is a highly communicable disease of the lungs and other organs caused by a bacterium transmitted through the air when infected people cough or sneeze.
 This is what is happening in developing nations, where the AIDS epidemic is raging. "In many places, more than half the beds in medical wards are patients with tuberculosis," Bloom said. "Many of these people do, in fact, die of AIDS.
 You don't have to have a depressed immune system to get tuberculosis." In the United States, public health officials began to recognize about five years ago that tuberculosis -- after steadily declining since the 1950s -- was making a surprising comeback as a result of the AIDS epidemic.
 This year, Bloom said, the number of cases of active tuberculosis in the United States is up nearly 5% over last year, with 23,495 new cases.
