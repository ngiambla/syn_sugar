 By Xandra Kayden, Forecast interviews were conducted by Xandra Kayden, visiting scholar, Center for Politics and Policy, Claremont Graduate School, and the author of Surviving Power (Free Press).
 Two propositions on California's Nov. 6 ballot would, among other things, limit the terms of statewide officeholders and state legislators.
 Proposition 131 would limit statewide elected officials to two consecutive four-year terms, state legislators to 12 consecutive years in office; Proposition 140 would hold Assembly members to six years in office, state senators and statewide elected officials to eight.
 If either passes, or both do, what would state government be like by 1996 and thereafter?
 The Times asked six legislators and legislative specialists.
 Mountjoy, member of the state Assembly (R-Monrovia), first elected in 1978, a former general contractor who has served as mayor and city councilman of Monrovia (1968-76): By 1996, there would be all new faces.
 Term limits would give the people of California more control over the Legislature, and the Legislature would be less prone to special interests, because legislators would know they are going to be there for six years and they're out. (Term limits) would stop (politics) from being a professional occupation.
 Robert Presley, state senator (D-Riverside) since 1974, formerly a member of the Riverside County Sheriff's Department for 24 years, 12 of them as undersheriff: My guess is that in about 20 years, there would be another initiative to change (term limits) because we will have found that (they) didn't work.
 Since states do have the power to amend the Constitution on their own, although it is much harder to do it that way, it could very well be that the groundswell of support for (this) movement in some key industrial states would lead to, not only initiatives in those states to restrict their own state legislative terms, but also . . . a demand for a constitutional amendment to do the same.
