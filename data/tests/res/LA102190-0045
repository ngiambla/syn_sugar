 Two propositions on California's Nov. 6 ballot would, among other things, limit the terms of statewide officeholders and state legislators.
 So, governing the state of California . . . is not as easy and simple as a lot of people would think.
 And the other thing a lot of people seem to think is that you the governor -- or you the legislator -- can get up there and solve these problems tomorrow.
 As to what are the implications of term limitations in the state of California, a lot of people think that this is a partisan issue.
 The parties could be helped by this . . . people would have to become more dependent on the party for funding and for guidance, and less dependent on the special interests.
