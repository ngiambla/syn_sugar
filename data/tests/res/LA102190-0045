 Two propositions on California's Nov. 6 ballot would, among other things, limit the terms of statewide officeholders and state legislators.
 The lobbyists are there for a very long time, and they become very expert in their fields . . . and will be even more influential, more powerful.
 So, governing the state of California . . . is not as easy and simple as a lot of people would think.
 And the other thing a lot of people seem to think is that you the governor -- or you the legislator -- can get up there and solve these problems tomorrow.
 But legislatures also need strong committee chairmen, and term limits mean that relatively inexperienced people are going to be in leadership and that they are -- by definition -- lame ducks from the very beginning.
 Petracca, assistant professor of politics and society, UC Irvine: The national effect would be very impressive because, unlike Oklahoma (where voters recently approved a 12-year-limit on legislators), which does not have a reputation for being in the vanguard of political change in America, California does.
 Because it is the largest political state in the country, a success for either proposition here is likely to have spinoff moves around the country. . . .
 As to what are the implications of term limitations in the state of California, a lot of people think that this is a partisan issue.
 The parties could be helped by this . . . people would have to become more dependent on the party for funding and for guidance, and less dependent on the special interests.
 If there are constant changes, the impact of term limits would be to empower the bureaucracy -- the people who are not elected -- and (they) would definitely empower the special interests who have the finances and the ability to assist the bureaucrats.
