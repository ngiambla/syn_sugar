 Two propositions on California's Nov. 6 ballot would, among other things, limit the terms of statewide officeholders and state legislators.
 Would passage of such measures be likely to spur similar legislation in other states, or at the federal level?
 The Times asked six legislators and legislative specialists.
 The argument that the lobbyists would take advantage of them, I believe, is not valid.
 So, governing the state of California . . . is not as easy and simple as a lot of people would think.
