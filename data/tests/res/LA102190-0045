 The argument that the lobbyists would take advantage of them, I believe, is not valid.
 It is the ethnic mix, the cultural diversity -- all of those things have to be cranked in.
 That is probably the most negative impact.
 I have tried to make the argument that it is not really partisan at all.
 It seems that as we (Latinos) begin to make entries into the political process, the rules are beginning to change.
