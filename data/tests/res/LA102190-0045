 Proposition 131 would limit statewide elected officials to two consecutive four-year terms, state legislators to 12 consecutive years in office; Proposition 140 would hold Assembly members to six years in office, state senators and statewide elected officials to eight. </P> <P> If either passes, or both do, what would state government be like by 1996 and thereafter?
 The Times asked six legislators and legislative specialists. </P> <P> Richard L.
 The argument that the lobbyists would take advantage of them, I believe, is not valid. </P> <P> Term limits would give the people of California more control over the Legislature, and the Legislature would be less prone to special interests, because legislators would know they are going to be there for six years and they're out. </P> <P> (Term limits) would stop (politics) from being a professional occupation.
 At least it would not be dominated by professionals. </P> <P> Robert Presley, state senator (D-Riverside) since 1974, formerly a member of the Riverside County Sheriff's Department for 24 years, 12 of them as undersheriff: </P> <P> My guess is that in about 20 years, there would be another initiative to change (term limits) because we will have found that (they) didn't work. </P> <P> The lobbyists are there for a very long time, and they become very expert in their fields . . . and will be even more influential, more powerful.
 I have tried to make the argument that it is not really partisan at all. </P> <P> The parties could be helped by this . . . people would have to become more dependent on the party for funding and for guidance, and less dependent on the special interests. </P> <P> The big problem is that nationally -- or locally -- we do not have a culture that encourages and rewards public service for short periods of time.
