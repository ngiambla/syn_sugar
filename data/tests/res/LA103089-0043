 Davies-Hale had been among those who had cagily stayed back, going with a more conservative approach. "I was concentrating on running five-minute miles," he said.
 The two quickly went in different directions -- Binns falling back (he eventually dropped out) and Davies-Hale moving up. "I asked Binnsie who was in the first group, he told me, and I went," Davies-Hale said.
 At 22 miles, Davies-Hale was in the lead and in control, running smoothly and not appearing to labor under the bright sun.
 Following him, and likewise picking off the fading runners in the first pack, were Ravil Kashapov of the Soviet Union, who was second in 2:13:19, and David Long, also from the British Midlands, who was third in 2:13:37.
 Even the 2:28 is respectable -- only five U.S. women have run under 2:30. "I guess when you are having a good day, nothing is going to get you down," she said.
 Davies-Hale, a former plumber from Rugeley, Straffordshire, seemed bemused by the attention and nonplussed that he had just won $50,000 in prize money.
 Davies-Hale may have shown a liking for running in heat when he won the Boulder Bolder that year in terrific heat.
 He was a 1984 Olympian in the steeplechase and, on the advice of others, moved up to 5,000 and 10,000 meters.
