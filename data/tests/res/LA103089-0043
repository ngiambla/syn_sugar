 Temperatures during the Old Style/Chicago marathon hovered in the mid-60s, with 53% humidity.
 The heat sapped the strength of most runners, giving the patient and steady runners a distinct advantage.
 Among the men, Paul Davies-Hale of England proved the most patient, winning in a rather pedestrian 2 hours 11 minutes 25 seconds, in his first marathon ever.
 It was the slowest winning time in this race since 1982.
 After a week of summer-like weather, race organizers hoped to be salvaged by a good race; to have, if not impressive times on this flat and fast course, at least a memorable race.
