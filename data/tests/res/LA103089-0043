 Temperatures during the Old Style/Chicago marathon hovered in the mid-60s, with 53% humidity.
 The heat sapped the strength of most runners, giving the patient and steady runners a distinct advantage.
 Among the men, Paul Davies-Hale of England proved the most patient, winning in a rather pedestrian 2 hours 11 minutes 25 seconds, in his first marathon ever.
 It was the slowest winning time in this race since 1982.
 The race conditions were simply more bad luck for the 12th running of Chicago's marathon, which has been fighting for respectability since losing its sponsor in 1986 and staging no race in 1987.
 After a week of summer-like weather, race organizers hoped to be salvaged by a good race; to have, if not impressive times on this flat and fast course, at least a memorable race.
 The two quickly went in different directions -- Binns falling back (he eventually dropped out) and Davies-Hale moving up. "I asked Binnsie who was in the first group, he told me, and I went," Davies-Hale said.
