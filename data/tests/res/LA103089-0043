 Davies-Hale had been among those who had cagily stayed back, going with a more conservative approach. "I was concentrating on running five-minute miles," he said.
 The two quickly went in different directions -- Binns falling back (he eventually dropped out) and Davies-Hale moving up. "I asked Binnsie who was in the first group, he told me, and I went," Davies-Hale said.
 At 22 miles, Davies-Hale was in the lead and in control, running smoothly and not appearing to labor under the bright sun.
 Following him, and likewise picking off the fading runners in the first pack, were Ravil Kashapov of the Soviet Union, who was second in 2:13:19, and David Long, also from the British Midlands, who was third in 2:13:37.
 Davies-Hale may have shown a liking for running in heat when he won the Boulder Bolder that year in terrific heat.
