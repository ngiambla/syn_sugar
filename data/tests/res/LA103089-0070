 A jet trainer crashed Sunday on the flight deck of the aircraft carrier Lexington in the Gulf of Mexico, killing five people, injuring at least two and damaging several aircraft, the Navy said.
 The crash also did major damage to two aircraft on the flight deck and minor damage to another, a Pentagon spokesman said.
