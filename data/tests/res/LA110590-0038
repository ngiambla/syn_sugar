 Douglas Wakiihuri, a Kenyan who trains in Japan, was the overall winner and Poland's Wanda Panfil, who lives in Mexico, was the women's winner in Sunday's race which was plagued by heat and humidity.
 Kim Jones of Spokane, Wash., finished second among the women for the second consecutive year, five seconds behind Panfil to make it the closest finish in the race's 21-year history.
 Mohamed Idris of Brooklyn, N.Y., who finished 22nd in 2:22:23, originally was announced as the top American, but race officials later determined he was an Egyptian citizen.
 It was Wakiihuri's first marathon in the United States and the third for Panfil, who did not finish the '88 New York City Marathon, after falling near the 16-mile mark and suffering a bruised ankle.
 After staying with the lead pack for the first 20 miles, the cool, composed Wakiihuri took control and pulled away to a 40-second victory over Salvador Garcia of Mexico.
