"What a brilliant sign of the vitality of our two countries." </P> <P> The breakthrough came in a 6-foot-tall service tunnel that will be used to maintain two rail tunnels still being bored.
 It marked a symbolic milestone in Europe's biggest engineering project. </P> <P> Using jackhammers, Graham Fagg, 42, of Dover, England, and Philippe Cozette, 37, of Calais, France, knocked out the last foot of chalk to link up the British and French sides of the tunnel -- which has been dubbed a "chunnel." </P> <P> The smiling pair then clasped hands, embraced and exchanged their national flags.
 Workers in overalls looked on and applauded. </P> <P> "God save the queen!" cried French workers, uncorking Champagne bottles. </P> <P> "Vive la France!" came the reply from the British side. </P> <P> Saturday's handshake came three years to the day after tunneling began at Sangatte, near Calais, and in Folkestone, England. </P> <P> The $16.7-billion Channel Tunnel will make it possible to travel from Paris to London by high-speed train in 3 1/2 hours when it opens in June, 1993. </P> <P> The train trip through just the tunnel is expected to take 35 minutes, compared with 90 minutes to cross the channel by ferry. </P> <P> Fares for the undersea crossing have not been set.
