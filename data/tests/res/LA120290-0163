 The train trip through just the tunnel is expected to take 35 minutes, compared with 90 minutes to cross the channel by ferry.
 The tunnelers have spent the last month drilling through the last 100 yards of chalk with giant American-built boring machines, trying to align the two halves.

 Fagg and Rifkind rode on to Sangatte, while Cozette and Delebarre headed for Folkestone to join in celebrations that lasted into the night.
