From Associated Press SANGATTE, France Cheers erupted Saturday on both sides of the English Channel when British and French workers digging the Channel Tunnel finally met after knocking out a passage large enough to walk through and shake hands. "Today, for the first time, men can cross the channel underground," French President Francois Mitterrand said. "What a brilliant sign of the vitality of our two countries." The breakthrough came in a 6-foot-tall service tunnel that will be used to maintain two rail tunnels still being bored.
 Using jackhammers, Graham Fagg, 42, of Dover, England, and Philippe Cozette, 37, of Calais, France, knocked out the last foot of chalk to link up the British and French sides of the tunnel -- which has been dubbed a "chunnel." The smiling pair then clasped hands, embraced and exchanged their national flags.
