 Cheers erupted Saturday on both sides of the English Channel when British and French workers digging the Channel Tunnel finally met after knocking out a passage large enough to walk through and shake hands. "Today, for the first time, men can cross the channel underground," French President Francois Mitterrand said. "What a brilliant sign of the vitality of our two countries." The breakthrough came in a 6-foot-tall service tunnel that will be used to maintain two rail tunnels still being bored.
 Using jackhammers, Graham Fagg, 42, of Dover, England, and Philippe Cozette, 37, of Calais, France, knocked out the last foot of chalk to link up the British and French sides of the tunnel -- which has been dubbed a "chunnel." The smiling pair then clasped hands, embraced and exchanged their national flags.
 Workers in overalls looked on and applauded. "God save the queen!" cried French workers, uncorking Champagne bottles. "Vive la France!" came the reply from the British side.
 The $16.7-billion Channel Tunnel will make it possible to travel from Paris to London by high-speed train in 3 1/2 hours when it opens in June, 1993.
 The tunnelers have spent the last month drilling through the last 100 yards of chalk with giant American-built boring machines, trying to align the two halves.
 The British tunnelers actually linked up with the French on Oct. 29, when workers drilled a 2-inch hole through the chalk in a service tunnel.
 After widening the passage from the size of a peephole to a window, they laid down their tools and shook hands. "Bonjour," boomed Fagg. "Hello," Cozette said, chuckling.
 Michel Delebarre and Malcolm Rifkind, the French and British transportation ministers, rode in small service trains down the maintenance tunnel to witness the handshake.
