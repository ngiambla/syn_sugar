 The names will be different, but more hurricanes with the powerful punches of Hugo and Gilbert may be prowling the Atlantic, Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico in the future. "The probability of more intense hurricanes in the Atlantic region is greater in the next decade or two than it has been in the 1970s and '80s," says meteorologist William M.
 The well-watered conditions in the '50s and '60s produced 31 of the most severe kind (categories 4 and 5) in the 17-year period 1950 to 1967.
 This September's Hugo, which ripped through the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico before clobbering South Carolina, had sustained winds of 150 m.p.h. and an atmospheric pressure of 918 millibars (27.1 inches).
 In 1980, Allen, the mightiest Caribbean storm then recorded, had lost much of its punch before it hit the Gulf Coast of Texas. "If the future is like the past with its pattern of atmospheric conditions, there is a good probability of the return of stronger storms," Gray said.
 But in the 1990s, he warns, U.S. destruction will be at least four to five times more costly than in the '50s and '60s, because of the boom in population and property development along coastal areas.
 To develop, they need tropical ocean-surface temperatures of about 80 degrees Fahrenheit. "If tropical ocean temperatures go up, the intensity of hurricanes will," Emanuel explains. "Sea-surface temperatures set the upper limits." The biggest uncertainty, he says, is whether global warming will affect tropical ocean temperatures.
