 While more than a thousand runners were treated to an evening of comedy, music and magic at Saturday night's carbo load dinner on Mission Bay, Ernesto Beatriz Martinez of Mexico City was treated to a bumpy 12 1/2-hour bus ride from his hometown to border town Tijuana.
 Not until early Sunday morning did Beatriz Martinez, 29, cross the U.S./Mexican border to register for, then reach the starting line of, the San Diego International Marathon on East Mission Bay Drive.
 Beatriz Martinez and Rollins received $5,000 each for their victories.
 And for Beatriz Martinez, who ran cross country for San Diego City College in 1988, he might as well have won the lottery.
 This was a man who earlier this week was running in tattered shoes and had a TV raffled in his honor to raise the $180 required to cover transportation, the entrance fee and other expenses. "I want to help my family and friends who raised the money for me," said Beatriz Martinez, a school teacher in Mexico City. "My family, they are very poor." Plaatjes and Ireland took home $2,500 each, and Maurilio Castillo (2:18:06) of Naucalpan, Mexico, the men's third place finisher, and Great Britian's Gillian Horovitz (2:43:20), now of New York City, third in the women's race, received $1,500.
