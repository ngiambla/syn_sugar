 2017 IEEE 30th Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering (CCECE) Keyword and Keyphrase Extraction using Newtons Law of Universal Gravitation Nicholas Giamblanco1 and Prathap Siddavaatam2 Abstract In current times, there has been a surge in the amount of collected data from computational systems.
 The vast amount of data can be useful in many applications and elds, particularly so in Big Data Analytics.
 The ADS system model takes a text document as input, and outputs a semantically-relevant summary of this information.
 This infor- mation can be further separated and outlined as keywords, or keyphrases.
 This paper proposes a novel unsupervised approach for automatic keyword and keyphrase generation system using Newtons Law of Universal Gravitation.
 This approach allows for a complete capture of meaningful text, incorporating the physical structure of a document and discovered relationships between highly related words.
 Our model uses a new weighting method that combines both the character length of a word, and frequency of a word within a document to simulate a mass.
 Our model then computes the force of attraction and ranks the word- pair-force as a means of keyword and keyphrase extraction.
 The aim of an automatic keyword and keyphrase extraction model is to capture meaningful infor- mation within the document, extract this information, and automatically generate a list of meaningful keywords which relates to the documents meaning.
 With the amount of collected data on the rise, keywords and keyphrases have much importance in the eld of natural language processing, information retrieval, data- mining, text summarization, and text classication. [7] This article aims to improve the task of identifying and generating keywords and keyphrases from documents in 1N.
