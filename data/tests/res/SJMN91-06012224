 His time of 5.77 seconds was eclipsed by the 5.75-second time of Daron Council, a former narcotics officer who now works in crime prevention for the Alachua County, Fla., sheriff's department.
 His time was far from the 5.55 he ran in 1987 that is still listed as the fastest ever at 50 meters. "I'm in very good shape, but I'm not in racing shape," Johnson said as he was escorted to drug testing, for which he was randomly selected.
