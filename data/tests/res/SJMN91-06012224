 It also led to the two-year suspension from the sport that made an epic event of Johnson's race Friday.; Johnson got off to an uncharacteristically slow start and finished second by a few inches to Council.; "I got caught in the blocks," Johnson said.; By then, the start had been delayed eight minutes by two false starts and a problem with the board track.; Johnson took his second-place finish in stride. "I think it was a success," Johnson said. "There was a lot of pressure on me because it was my first race back, and it was hard to concentrate on the race with the way the fans were yelling for me."; It was Johnson's first indoor loss in 11 meets dating to February 1987.
