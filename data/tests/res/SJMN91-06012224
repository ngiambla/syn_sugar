 In his first race after a two-year suspension for drug use, Ben Johnson proved Friday night that he can run fast even without the anabolic steroid that caused his expulsion from the 1988 Olympics in Seoul, South Korea.
 But the 29-year-old Canadian, whose indoor and outdoor world records were washed away by admissions that he used performance-enhancing substances for seven years, managed only to finish second in the 50-meter dash of the Hamilton Spectator Games.
 His time of 5.77 seconds was eclipsed by the 5.75-second time of Daron Council, a former narcotics officer who now works in crime prevention for the Alachua County, Fla., sheriff's department.
 He would merely have been a gold medalist if a positive test at the 1988 Olympics had not turned him into the most vilified champion in the history of the Games.
 Johnson took his second-place finish in stride. "I think it was a success," Johnson said. "There was a lot of pressure on me because it was my first race back, and it was hard to concentrate on the race with the way the fans were yelling for me." It was Johnson's first indoor loss in 11 meets dating to February 1987.
 His time was far from the 5.55 he ran in 1987 that is still listed as the fastest ever at 50 meters. "I'm in very good shape, but I'm not in racing shape," Johnson said as he was escorted to drug testing, for which he was randomly selected.
 Despite Johnson's trimness, he said he weighed the same -- 174 pounds -- and was lifting the same amount of weight -- bench-pressing 365 pounds -- as before his two-year suspension for testing positive for a performance-enhancing steroid. "People are saying I'm smaller," Johnson said before the race. "Size doesn't matter.
