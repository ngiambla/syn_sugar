 In his first race after a two-year suspension for drug use, Ben Johnson proved Friday night that he can run fast even without the anabolic steroid that caused his expulsion from the 1988 Olympics in Seoul, South Korea.
 The brief race produced a record crowd of 17,050 and drew nearly 500 journalists from 14 countries in North America, Europe and Asia.
 They were attracted by the return of Johnson, whose day of infamy, Sept. 24, 1988, has assured him a millennium of fame.
 By then, the start had been delayed eight minutes by two false starts and a problem with the board track.
 It was a different-looking Johnson than the one who had bolted to apparent victory in the Olympics.
