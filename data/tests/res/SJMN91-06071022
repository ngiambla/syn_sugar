 Foresters say the heavy rains that have pelted California in the past two weeks have worsened the threat of fierce forest fires this summer because they will stimulate the growth of grasses.
 The grasses will turn paper-dry by July, helping to spread fires quickly through trees and brush killed and weakened by five consecutive years of drought and by insects, which more easily invade dry wood than moist.
 As of last month, live pines in the Mount Palomar area near San Diego had less moisture than boards at a lumber yard.
 Firefighting also will be made tougher this year because much of the military reserve and National Guard equipment and pilots normally mobilized against wildfires are still in the Persian Gulf and probably will be there several more months.
 Given the severity of the threat and lack of equipment and water to fight fires, officials throughout the region say they plan an unusually aggressive approach this spring, trying to put out even the smallest wildfires before they spread, and taking preventive measures such as deploying firefighters to an area where lightning storms are forecast.
