 The grasses will turn paper-dry by July, helping to spread fires quickly through trees and brush killed and weakened by five consecutive years of drought and by insects, which more easily invade dry wood than moist.
 The area at risk of severe fires spreads beyond California and takes in about a third of the United States mainland, including Oregon and Washington east of the Cascades and much of Nevada, Arizona, Utah, Colorado, Wyoming, Idaho, Montana and the Dakotas.
 Given the severity of the threat and lack of equipment and water to fight fires, officials throughout the region say they plan an unusually aggressive approach this spring, trying to put out even the smallest wildfires before they spread, and taking preventive measures such as deploying firefighters to an area where lightning storms are forecast.
 One reason the fire threat is so grave in California is population growth, which has spread suburban development into wilderness areas such as the canyons east of Malibu Beach, 25 miles from central Los Angeles, where million-dollar homes sit on brushy hillsides covered with highly flammable greasewood.
 Fire corridor Fire officials consider the Malibu canyons a natural fire corridor because high winds whip through them to the ocean. "We are going to have quite a time trying to protect those structures," said Paul H.
