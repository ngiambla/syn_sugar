 SPEED TRAP; By Charlie Francis with Jeff Coplon Arts &amp; Books RUNNING AWAY FROM THE TRUTH Books Bamberger is a Philadelphia Inquirer sportswriter.
 Martin's, 306 pp., $18.95 CHARLIE Francis, testifying in 1988 in Toronto at a federal inquiry about the use of performance-enhancing drugs in sports, seemed a mad scientist, something on the order of Dr.
 Francis, the Canadian national sprint coach, knew the polysyllabic names and complex characteristics of steroids -- furazabol, stanozolol, Dianabol -- as if they were members of his family.
 On Sept. 24, 1988, Francis' most famous pupil, Ben Johnson, who immigrated to Toronto from Jamaica as a scrawny 14-year-old, ran 100 meters in 9.79 seconds at the Olympics in Seoul, South Korea.
 But the Francis system, like all systems, was not foolproof. "About 42 hours after my life's greatest moment," Francis writes on the first page of his confessional, "Speed Trap," his "nightmare began." Johnson, the world's fastest man, had tested positive for illegal steroid use.
