 The answer may decide the men's winner of Monday's Boston Marathon.

 They have produced five of the top 10 times and eight of the top 15 in the race's storied history.
 The winner was 1988 Olympic champion Gelindo Bordin, who outsmarted the early pacesetters by running a patient, calculating race.
 The women's division also is filled with many respectable entrants.
