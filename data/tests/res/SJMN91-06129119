 At the end of the chase the officer takes his baton and brutally hits the suspect on the back eight to 10 times, then kicks him in the face.
 The offending officer's police report indicated that the suspect's injuries were due to a fall from his bike and that he appeared unconscious, although he had also struggled against being handcuffed.
 One sergeant reported that the suspect kept trying to move around and had to be told to remain lying down.
 But four citizens called to complain that they had witnessed the arrest and that the suspect not only was not struggling but also had been brutally beaten.
 In response to another officer's inquiry, the original officer picked up the suspect, let his head fall to the pavement and said, "It looks like he's dead." Both officers smirked and laughed.
 One of the problems in monitoring police brutality is that almost all victims of police abuse have themselves committed some kind of law violation.
 He correctly notes that it is important for police credibility that police chiefs break the code of silence and repudiate such acts and attitudes.
 Those government employees who are given the right and the power to use force against citizens should be the most accountable.
 A minimal invasion of their privacy is a small price to pay for the power to maim and kill.
 Monitoring police brutality is further complicated by the fact that local communities leave it to the police departments to investigate citizen complaints.
