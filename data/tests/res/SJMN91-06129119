 SJMN91-06129119 06129119 Drawing; DRAWING: Richard Milholland -- Los Angeles Times OPINION; POLICE CONSIDER THE following case: A suspect involved in a high-speed chase refuses to stop.; At the end of the chase the officer takes his baton and brutally hits the suspect on the back eight to 10 times, then kicks him in the face.
 The suspect, unconscious, is taken to Valley Medical Center where he is found to have a dislocated shoulder, a concussion, and numerous cuts, bruises and contusions.
 The internal affairs department determined that the complaint was unsubstantiated and the matter was dropped.; But four citizens called to complain that they had witnessed the arrest and that the suspect not only was not struggling but also had been brutally beaten.; According to the witnesses, the officer taunted the suspect, knelt on the suspect's stomach, beat him numerous times with his club and kicked him in his face.; The witnesses also said:; The suspect at no time resisted.
 In response to another officer's inquiry, the original officer picked up the suspect, let his head fall to the pavement and said, "It looks like he's dead." Both officers smirked and laughed.; The offending officer was later arrested and prosecuted by the district attorney.; What if there had not been four citizens who observed the brutal beating of my client?; One of the problems in monitoring police brutality is that almost all victims of police abuse have themselves committed some kind of law violation.
