 According to the witnesses, the officer taunted the suspect, knelt on the suspect's stomach, beat him numerous times with his club and kicked him in his face.
 San Jose Police Chief Joseph MacNamara recently referred to the Los Angeles incident as "disgusting brutality" and pointed out that the disturbing aspect was the failure of leadership and the code of silence.
 He correctly notes that it is important for police credibility that police chiefs break the code of silence and repudiate such acts and attitudes.
 Monitoring police brutality is further complicated by the fact that local communities leave it to the police departments to investigate citizen complaints.
 Any loss of police confidentiality is a fair and necessary trade-off for the right to carry and use a club.
