 You can have your tamale and eat it too, says Rachel Torres, diabetes educator at San Jose Hospital and coordinator of the Diabetes Society of Santa Clara Valley's Hispanic Education Program.
 Beginning this summer, Torres and other health professionals will be offering nutrition and exercise classes geared toward Hispanics in an effort to educate them on the dangers of diabetes.
 Health experts believe the Hispanic diet and genetic predisposition may be contributing factors. "Our food is one of the richest in terms of taste and nutrition," said Torres. "But it's the way we prepare the food that messes things up for us." In her classes, Torres said she will instruct her students to prepare tamales, refried beans and other traditional Hispanic dishes using polyunsaturated oil rather than the more traditional recipes that call for the use of lard.
 Although courses for Hispanic diabetics and their families have been offered by the Diabetic Society for almost three years, lessons on the benefits of good nutrition and exercise to combat the disease will be offered for the first time.
 Sue Ann Kelly, education director for the Diabetes Society, said the classes may be the first ones ever geared specifically toward the Hispanic lifestyle. "It's a powerful feeling our educators get when they discover all the cultural issues that come in to play when dealing with diabetes," she said.
