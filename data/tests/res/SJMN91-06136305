 You can have your tamale and eat it too, says Rachel Torres, diabetes educator at San Jose Hospital and coordinator of the Diabetes Society of Santa Clara Valley's Hispanic Education Program.
 The secret to eating Mexican and other Hispanic foods while still maintaining a healthy diet is in the preparation of the food, she said.
 Beginning this summer, Torres and other health professionals will be offering nutrition and exercise classes geared toward Hispanics in an effort to educate them on the dangers of diabetes.
 According to state Health Department statistics, the incidence of diabetes in the Hispanic population is three times that of the general population.
 Although courses for Hispanic diabetics and their families have been offered by the Diabetic Society for almost three years, lessons on the benefits of good nutrition and exercise to combat the disease will be offered for the first time.
