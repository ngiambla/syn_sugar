 Health experts believe the Hispanic diet and genetic predisposition may be contributing factors. "Our food is one of the richest in terms of taste and nutrition," said Torres. "But it's the way we prepare the food that messes things up for us."

 Although courses for Hispanic diabetics and their families have been offered by the Diabetic Society for almost three years, lessons on the benefits of good nutrition and exercise to combat the disease will be offered for the first time.
 Sue Ann Kelly, education director for the Diabetes Society, said the classes may be the first ones ever geared specifically toward the Hispanic lifestyle. "It's a powerful feeling our educators get when they discover all the cultural issues that come in to play when dealing with diabetes," she said.
