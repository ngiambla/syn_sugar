 Unless an unusually cool summer intervenes, these are the ingredients for what could become one of the worst wildfire seasons in California's history. "Right now the rains have caused everything to green up, but that can change in a few weeks," Lisa Boyd, a spokeswoman for the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection in Sacramento, said Monday. "The state's really a tinderbox this year.
 Particularly vulnerable are the eucalyptus groves that did not survive the freeze, Mauldin said. "Fires in there are going to be particularly hot, hard to put out," he said.
 Summer weather will be the key to how severe this fire season is. "If we get into a period of temperatures in the 90s and 100s and it stays that way for a week or so, there is some real potential for major fires," Mauldin said.
 Two of the forestry department's 22 ranger units -- both in Southern California -- are fully staffed for the fire season now, Boyd said, and all are expected to be ready by mid-June.
 Officials at the federal Boise Interagency Fire Center in Idaho, which coordinates firefighting efforts throughout the West, said parts of 11 states in the far West, and North Dakota and Minnesota, also face major fire danger this year.
