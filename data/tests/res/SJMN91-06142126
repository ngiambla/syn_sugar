 Unless an unusually cool summer intervenes, these are the ingredients for what could become one of the worst wildfire seasons in California's history. "Right now the rains have caused everything to green up, but that can change in a few weeks," Lisa Boyd, a spokeswoman for the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection in Sacramento, said Monday. "The state's really a tinderbox this year.
 Everyone's going to have to be extra careful." In Santa Clara County, the conditions are not yet extreme; March storms probably delayed fire season until mid-June.
 But the county's wild lands are littered with heavy fuel -- brush and trees -- killed by the drought or the December freeze. "The late rains have given us a real good grass crop, the catalyst to ignite heavier fuels," said fire prevention officer Dick Mauldin at the forestry department's Morgan Hill ranger unit.
 Particularly vulnerable are the eucalyptus groves that did not survive the freeze, Mauldin said. "Fires in there are going to be particularly hot, hard to put out," he said.
 Summer weather will be the key to how severe this fire season is. "If we get into a period of temperatures in the 90s and 100s and it stays that way for a week or so, there is some real potential for major fires," Mauldin said.
 In Alameda and Contra Costa counties, officials also are bracing for a long, hot summer. "We don't want to say this is the worst fire season in X years, but we are gearing up for it," said Ned MacKay, spokesman for the East Bay Regional Park District. "We have to be prepared." Statewide, the biggest fire threat looms in the chaparral-covered coastal mountains south of Santa Barbara, where the moisture content of trees and shrubs is the lowest ever recorded for this time of year, Boyd said. "Every year the drought continues, the conditions get more explosive, but we can't say for sure what is going to happen this year," Boyd said.
 Two of the forestry department's 22 ranger units -- both in Southern California -- are fully staffed for the fire season now, Boyd said, and all are expected to be ready by mid-June.
 Officials at the federal Boise Interagency Fire Center in Idaho, which coordinates firefighting efforts throughout the West, said parts of 11 states in the far West, and North Dakota and Minnesota, also face major fire danger this year.
