 The December freeze killed heavy brush and millions of trees that are now primed to burn.
 March rains nurtured grass that soon will turn tinder dry.
 Unless an unusually cool summer intervenes, these are the ingredients for what could become one of the worst wildfire seasons in California's history. "Right now the rains have caused everything to green up, but that can change in a few weeks," Lisa Boyd, a spokeswoman for the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection in Sacramento, said Monday. "The state's really a tinderbox this year.
 But the county's wild lands are littered with heavy fuel -- brush and trees -- killed by the drought or the December freeze. "The late rains have given us a real good grass crop, the catalyst to ignite heavier fuels," said fire prevention officer Dick Mauldin at the forestry department's Morgan Hill ranger unit.
 In Alameda and Contra Costa counties, officials also are bracing for a long, hot summer. "We don't want to say this is the worst fire season in X years, but we are gearing up for it," said Ned MacKay, spokesman for the East Bay Regional Park District. "We have to be prepared." Statewide, the biggest fire threat looms in the chaparral-covered coastal mountains south of Santa Barbara, where the moisture content of trees and shrubs is the lowest ever recorded for this time of year, Boyd said. "Every year the drought continues, the conditions get more explosive, but we can't say for sure what is going to happen this year," Boyd said.
