 Summer weather will be the key to how severe this fire season is. "If we get into a period of temperatures in the 90s and 100s and it stays that way for a week or so, there is some real potential for major fires," Mauldin said.
 Two of the forestry department's 22 ranger units -- both in Southern California -- are fully staffed for the fire season now, Boyd said, and all are expected to be ready by mid-June.
