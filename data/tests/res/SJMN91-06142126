 All that after five years of drought parched the landscape.
 State forestry officials estimate 10 million trees -- Boyd called them "standing kindling" -- have died in California's wooded areas since the drought began.
 The Morgan Hill unit covers parts of Santa Clara, Alameda, Contra Costa, Stanislaus, San Joaquin and Merced counties.
 Two of the forestry department's 22 ranger units -- both in Southern California -- are fully staffed for the fire season now, Boyd said, and all are expected to be ready by mid-June.
 California doesn't face the fire threat alone.
