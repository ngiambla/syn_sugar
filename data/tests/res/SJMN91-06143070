 This nation's volatile election was postponed today as the country was plunged into shock and turmoil after Tuesday's assassination of former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi.
 Some shocked Indian political leaders told reporters they feared Rajiv Gandhi's assassination augured the death of India's four-decades-old democracy.
 Gandhi and his Congress Party have many enemies on the subcontinent, including violent separatists in Kashmir and Punjab, leftist revolutionaries and rightist Hindu militants.
 Gandhi, whose Congress Party provided the main backing to the New Delhi government at the time, was widely seen as being behind the dismissal, which angered the Tamil Tigers and their supporters in southern India.
 Singh, who denounced what he called Congress's "culture of corruption" and advocated divisive job set-asides for India's lower castes and religious minorities.
