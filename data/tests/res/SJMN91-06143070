 This nation's volatile election was postponed today as the country was plunged into shock and turmoil after Tuesday's assassination of former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi.
 He acted after consulting the president and the acting prime minister.
 Eyewitnesses at the assassination scene said Gandhi's body was ripped apart and decapitated by the force of the explosion.
 A Congress Party spokesman said the bomb was hidden in a bouquet of flowers offered to Gandhi as he approached the dais for his speech.
 There was no immediate indication who was responsible for the bomb, but speculation centered on Tamil separatists seeking an independent state in nearby Sri Lanka.
