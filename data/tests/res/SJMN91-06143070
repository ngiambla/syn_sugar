 This nation's volatile election was postponed today as the country was plunged into shock and turmoil after Tuesday's assassination of former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi.
 He acted after consulting the president and the acting prime minister.
 The first phase of the elections took place Monday, but voting for the remaining 60 percent of the 537 seats at stake will be June 12 and 15 instead of Thursday and Sunday.
 Eyewitnesses at the assassination scene said Gandhi's body was ripped apart and decapitated by the force of the explosion.
 Gandhi and his Congress Party have many enemies on the subcontinent, including violent separatists in Kashmir and Punjab, leftist revolutionaries and rightist Hindu militants.
