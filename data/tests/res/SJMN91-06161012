 Nature stages one of its most spectacular shows on July 11 -- a total eclipse of the sun, one that'll be among the longest this century.
 And the best viewing spots are virtually in California's back yard: The Big Island of Hawaii and the southern Baja California peninsula.
 There is a certain element of traveler out there (and) there's an awful lot of those people." The eclipse will be seen from Hawaii to central Brazil.
 The sky will grow darker, as if dusk has fallen, until the sun is completely blocked out for a few minutes as the moon's shadow falls on the earth.
 The eclipse will last the longest -- six minutes and 58 seconds -- at the center of the shadow in the town of Tuxpan, on Mexico's west coast.
 Firm estimates aren't available, but blotted-out-sun watchers are expected to number more than 100,000 -- perhaps 50,000 to 70,000 in Hawaii and an equal number in Baja. "The effect of it -- the view of seeing the sun disappear little by little and then actually having the (blue) sky disappear and having the birds stop singing -- it's miraculous," said Irving Hochman, a member of the San Francisco Amateur Astronomers. "It really is the most spectacular natural phenomenon possible." Bob Bruynesteyn, head of the San Mateo Astronomical Society, puts it succinctly: "Not too many people have stood in the shadow of the moon." It's romantic images like these that are inspiring a last-minute surge of would-be eclipse-watchers, travel agents say.
 Learning of the eclipse only a month ago, they began calling travel agents. "But they basically said they wouldn't even try -- everything was booked," said Pamela Dei Rossi.
 The Dei Rossis were in. "We are so excited," Pamela Dei Rossi said. "We had given up." Though travel arrangements are now tough to come by, some opportunities remain.
 Hawaii and Baja are the prime spots, because -- statistically at least -- they offer the best chance of cloudless skies.
 From the border to the northern edge of where the eclipse will be total is about a 16-hour drive, said Raul Cardenas, the Mexican consul in San Jose.
