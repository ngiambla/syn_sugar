"Eclipse" by Bryan Brewer.Where the sun seems to disappear; The July 11 solar eclipse will be visible from much of North and South America.
 But only a narrow swath of the Earth's surface will experience a total eclipse, with all of the sun blcoked out by the sites in the "path of totality." </CAPTION> <DESCRIPT> SPACE; SHOW; TRAVEL; PLANNING </DESCRIPT> <LEADPARA> Nature stages one of its most spectacular shows on July 11 -- a total eclipse of the sun, one that'll be among the longest this century.
 And the best viewing spots are virtually in California's back yard: The Big Island of Hawaii and the southern Baja California peninsula.; Unfortunately, you can probably forget about seeing it, because, unless you get lucky, you can't get there from here anymore. </LEADPARA> <SECTION> Front </SECTION> <HEADLINE> BEST SEATS ARE SOLD OUT FOR CELESTIAL SHOW </HEADLINE> <TEXT> With some people having booked trips as long as three years in advance, airline seats, rental cars and hotel reservations range from difficult to impossible to get, travel agents and others report.; "The closer you get to the event, the less there is" available, said Paul Kloetzel, president of O'Brien Travel Service in San Jose. "It's an event, and it rarely, rarely happens.
 Firm estimates aren't available, but blotted-out-sun watchers are expected to number more than 100,000 -- perhaps 50,000 to 70,000 in Hawaii and an equal number in Baja.; "The effect of it -- the view of seeing the sun disappear little by little and then actually having the (blue) sky disappear and having the birds stop singing -- it's miraculous," said Irving Hochman, a member of the San Francisco Amateur Astronomers. "It really is the most spectacular natural phenomenon possible."; Bob Bruynesteyn, head of the San Mateo Astronomical Society, puts it succinctly: "Not too many people have stood in the shadow of the moon."; It's romantic images like these that are inspiring a last-minute surge of would-be eclipse-watchers, travel agents say.; Pamela and Daniel Dei Rossi of Campbell were among those scramblers.
