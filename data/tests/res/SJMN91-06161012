 Nature stages one of its most spectacular shows on July 11 -- a total eclipse of the sun, one that'll be among the longest this century.
 And the best viewing spots are virtually in California's back yard: The Big Island of Hawaii and the southern Baja California peninsula.
 With some people having booked trips as long as three years in advance, airline seats, rental cars and hotel reservations range from difficult to impossible to get, travel agents and others report. "The closer you get to the event, the less there is" available, said Paul Kloetzel, president of O'Brien Travel Service in San Jose. "It's an event, and it rarely, rarely happens.
 There is a certain element of traveler out there (and) there's an awful lot of those people." The eclipse will be seen from Hawaii to central Brazil.
 The eclipse will last the longest -- six minutes and 58 seconds -- at the center of the shadow in the town of Tuxpan, on Mexico's west coast.
