 Nature stages one of its most spectacular shows on July 11 -- a total eclipse of the sun, one that'll be among the longest this century.
 There is a certain element of traveler out there (and) there's an awful lot of those people." The eclipse will be seen from Hawaii to central Brazil.
 The sky will grow darker, as if dusk has fallen, until the sun is completely blocked out for a few minutes as the moon's shadow falls on the earth.
 The eclipse will last the longest -- six minutes and 58 seconds -- at the center of the shadow in the town of Tuxpan, on Mexico's west coast.
 Hawaii and Baja are the prime spots, because -- statistically at least -- they offer the best chance of cloudless skies.
