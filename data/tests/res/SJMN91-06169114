 HURRICANES ARE part of the romance of the tropics.
 The great storms have made fictional plots of B movies and unmade real dreams of people who would implant civilization in an environment that could be swallowed up by nature in a moment.
 A hurricane ended the dream of a railroad down the Florida Keys in 1935 and virtually isolated Key West for two years.
 Nine years earlier, a "Big One" had stopped Miami's first real-estate boom in its tracks, pushing floodwaters inland to the new jai alai fronton near where Miami International Airport sits today.
 The last to hit Miami was Cleo, a small one, in 1964, and the intervening period of calm defies all odds.
