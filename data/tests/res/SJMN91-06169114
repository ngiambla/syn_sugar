 Hurricane season officially extends from June 1 through Nov. 30, and scientists at the National Hurricane Center, tucked away on the sixth floor of a nondescript office building in this Miami suburb, are perking up after another winter lull.
 In this part of the world, technology has made obsolete such disasters as the unnamed hurricane that surprised Galveston, Texas, in 1900, killing 6,000 people.

 More than 800 workers, brought down to build the Overseas Highway through the Florida Keys, were killed when 200 mph winds knocked their evacuation train off the tracks.
 Hurricanes change direction and intensify in a matter of hours and, in 24 hours, the specialists said, they could miscalculate one's track by 100 miles.
