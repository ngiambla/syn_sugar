 Hurricane season officially extends from June 1 through Nov. 30, and scientists at the National Hurricane Center, tucked away on the sixth floor of a nondescript office building in this Miami suburb, are perking up after another winter lull.
 The scientists took data from Hugo and applied it to the path taken by the 1926 hurricane into Miami. "It would be a totally different story here," said Max Mayfield, who collected photos from the 1926 storm to illustrate the model. "How many high-rises did they have on those barrier islands up in South Carolina?
 I think all these folks in their Miami Beach condos are going to be in for a rude awakening." A worst-case storm, with winds topping 150 mph, would put 5 feet of water in Joe's Stone Crabs restaurant, a Miami Beach landmark, and 9 feet of water on Biscayne Boulevard in downtown Miami.
