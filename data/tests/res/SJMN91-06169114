 What would one of those legendary storms of the past with 200 mph winds pushing huge tidal surges do to this low-lying metropolis on the Atlantic?
 Hurricane season officially extends from June 1 through Nov. 30, and scientists at the National Hurricane Center, tucked away on the sixth floor of a nondescript office building in this Miami suburb, are perking up after another winter lull.
 One of the specialists, Lixion Avila, has begun counting tropical waves that form off the coast of Africa every few days during hurricane season.
 More than 800 workers, brought down to build the Overseas Highway through the Florida Keys, were killed when 200 mph winds knocked their evacuation train off the tracks.
 Hurricanes change direction and intensify in a matter of hours and, in 24 hours, the specialists said, they could miscalculate one's track by 100 miles.
 This, and the number of years since the last major storm hit, has spawned a certain complacency among residents that the specialists find disturbing.
