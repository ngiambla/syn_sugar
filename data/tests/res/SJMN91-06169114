 The great storms have made fictional plots of B movies and unmade real dreams of people who would implant civilization in an environment that could be swallowed up by nature in a moment.
 What would one of those legendary storms of the past with 200 mph winds pushing huge tidal surges do to this low-lying metropolis on the Atlantic?
 Hurricane season officially extends from June 1 through Nov. 30, and scientists at the National Hurricane Center, tucked away on the sixth floor of a nondescript office building in this Miami suburb, are perking up after another winter lull.
 One of the specialists, Lixion Avila, has begun counting tropical waves that form off the coast of Africa every few days during hurricane season.
 About 20 of them intensify into stronger disturbances, ranging from tropical depressions, with wind speeds to 38 mph; to tropical storms, with winds from 39 to 73 mph; to hurricanes, with winds exceeding 74 mph.
 More than 800 workers, brought down to build the Overseas Highway through the Florida Keys, were killed when 200 mph winds knocked their evacuation train off the tracks.
 Miami has grown immensely since the last major storm and is greatly overdue, they said. "Historically, south Florida has had more hurricanes than any other site," said Jerry Jarrell, a hurricane specialist eyeing Miami's 27-year hiatus nervously. "We would expect a major hurricane to hit within 75 miles of Miami every eight years." At the center, scientists built a computer model to calculate what would happen if the 1926 hurricane were to hit Miami today.
 I think all these folks in their Miami Beach condos are going to be in for a rude awakening." A worst-case storm, with winds topping 150 mph, would put 5 feet of water in Joe's Stone Crabs restaurant, a Miami Beach landmark, and 9 feet of water on Biscayne Boulevard in downtown Miami.
 Hurricanes change direction and intensify in a matter of hours and, in 24 hours, the specialists said, they could miscalculate one's track by 100 miles.
 This, and the number of years since the last major storm hit, has spawned a certain complacency among residents that the specialists find disturbing.
