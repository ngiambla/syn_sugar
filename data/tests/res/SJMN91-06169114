 The last to hit Miami was Cleo, a small one, in 1964, and the intervening period of calm defies all odds.
 Hurricane season officially extends from June 1 through Nov. 30, and scientists at the National Hurricane Center, tucked away on the sixth floor of a nondescript office building in this Miami suburb, are perking up after another winter lull.
 That storm was almost exactly the strength of Hurricane Hugo, which hit in South Carolina with 135 mph winds in September 1989.
 Hurricanes change direction and intensify in a matter of hours and, in 24 hours, the specialists said, they could miscalculate one's track by 100 miles.
 This, and the number of years since the last major storm hit, has spawned a certain complacency among residents that the specialists find disturbing.
