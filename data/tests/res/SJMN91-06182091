 Marko Negovanovic, a member of the general staff, said on Belgrade television.
 Earlier Saturday evening, Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic forced yet another delay in the election of Stipe Mesic, a Croat, as president of Yugoslavia.
 Slovenia refused Saturday night to send a representative to Belgrade for a meeting of the eight-member Yugoslav presidency.
 Such a meeting might have resolved the leadership vacuum in the federal government.
 The Slovenian defense forces continued efforts to recapture border posts and said they had several under their control.
