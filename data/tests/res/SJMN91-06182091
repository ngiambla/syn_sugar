 The peace package was assembled by federal Prime Minister Ante Markovic, brokered by an emergency mission of the European Community and accepted by the leaders of Slovenia and Croatia, as well as Serbia.
 Condition upon condition Milosevic, seizing on Kucan's statement, insisted that Serbia would not allow Mesic to become president in the normal rotation until the Slovenian and Croatian parliaments agreed to the moratorium.
 The Slovenian government charged the army with repeated breaches of the cease-fire and demanded the surrender of army units and installations that Slovenian forces had surrounded and cut off since the fighting began Thursday.
