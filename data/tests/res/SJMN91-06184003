 Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia would follow Marshall as the second black to ascend to the court.
 But Thomas, who has risen in Republican ranks as an advocate of bootstrap conservatism, would present a striking change from Marshall, a civil-rights pioneer and an anchor of the court's declining liberal faction.
 Thomas, barely half the age of the man whose seat he was named to fill, came of age in the world that Marshall helped create.
 Now the question is to what extent Thomas would add weight to the court's new majority that appears willing to dismantle important parts of the legacy that Marshall helped to build.
 While not much is known about Thomas' views on most issues likely to come before the court, he has made clear his opposition to affirmative action and to policies that can be viewed as incorporating quotas or racial preferences.
