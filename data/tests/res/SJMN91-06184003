 While not much is known about Thomas' views on most issues likely to come before the court, he has made clear his opposition to affirmative action and to policies that can be viewed as incorporating quotas or racial preferences.
 Opposes affirmative action In his year as a federal appeals court judge, he has not ruled on affirmative action, but he has long been outspoken in taking the position that government affirmative-action programs are not only unwise but unconstitutional.
 Those views may well remain unknown through a confirmation process that may be contentious but that in the end is not likely to derail the nomination.
 Although the Catholic Church vigorously opposes abortion, Thomas has apparently never taken a public position on abortion or on the dimensions of the constitutional right to privacy, on which the right to abortion was based.
 In its most recent affirmative-action decision, a year ago, the court split 5-4 in upholding a Federal Communications Commission policy that gives preference to blacks and members of other minorities in acquiring some radio and television licenses.
 Views on big issues unknown; Thomas' views on the other major issues remain unknown, although the 1990 confirmation hearing for his seat on the Court of Appeals was widely viewed on Capitol Hill and in ideological interest groups as a rehearsal for a Supreme Court nomination.
 Some Democratic senators said at the time and again Monday that their votes to confirm him for the appeals court should not be taken as endorsements for the Supreme Court.
 Three years ago, the Senate denied confirmation to Judge Robert Bork despite having voted to confirm him only a few years earlier to the same court on which Thomas now sits.
 Introducing his nominee to the country at a televised news conference Monday, Bush drew on the powerful appeal of Thomas' life story as a self-motivated and self-made success. "Judge Thomas' life is a model for all Americans," Bush said.
 Well before Bush presented Thomas to the country Monday, it was clear that that chapter in the court's history is largely closed and that a new page was about to be turned.
