 President Bush on Monday nominated Clarence Thomas, a conservative Republican with a controversial record on civil rights, to replace retiring Justice Thurgood Marshall on the Supreme Court.
 Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia would follow Marshall as the second black to ascend to the court.
 Now the question is to what extent Thomas would add weight to the court's new majority that appears willing to dismantle important parts of the legacy that Marshall helped to build.
 While not much is known about Thomas' views on most issues likely to come before the court, he has made clear his opposition to affirmative action and to policies that can be viewed as incorporating quotas or racial preferences.
 Opposes affirmative action In his year as a federal appeals court judge, he has not ruled on affirmative action, but he has long been outspoken in taking the position that government affirmative-action programs are not only unwise but unconstitutional.
