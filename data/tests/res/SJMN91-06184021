 The label "black conservative," now firmly affixed to Clarence Thomas' name, does not begin to tell the story of his life, an American story of transformation.
 Born barnyard poor in segregated Georgia, forsaken by their father, Thomas and his brother were reared by strict Bible-believing grandparents who taught him to never say, "I can't." Thomas and his brother made it in the white world.
 Self-sufficiency, security "Self-sufficiency and spiritual and emotional security were our tools to carve out and secure freedom," he added. "Those who attempt to capture the daily counseling, oversight, common sense and vision of my grandparents in a governmental program are engaging in sheer folly." The very beliefs that have brought Thomas to the steps of the U.S.

 But life had taught him a lot. "He could barely read and write -- read enough to read the Bible," Thomas said in a 1983 interview with the Washington Post. "But he was a tough old man." He elaborated in the Heritage Foundation paper: "Of course, I thought my grandparents were too rigid and their expectations were too high.
 The most compassionate thing they did for us was teach us how to fend for ourselves in a hostile environment." But the world that lay beyond the confines of poverty and segregation was not totally closed to Thomas.
 Other seminarians referred to him as the "black spot on a white horse." Disgusted, he left at the end of his first year.
 In the 1960s, he flirted with the politics of "black power" and considered himself a follower of Malcolm X.
 In 1982, after a year as assistant education secretary for civil rights, Thomas was named by President Reagan to lead the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.
 Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, a steppingstone to the Supreme Court, a contentious confirmation process was forecast.
