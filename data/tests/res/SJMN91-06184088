 But Republicans said he should not divulge his feelings about controversies that might come before the court. "I'm satisfied that this man will pass muster," President Bush declared Monday in naming Thomas to succeed retiring Justice Thurgood Marshall.
 Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., said "in the past few months alone the Supreme Court is throwing out past decisions, and I think it is legitimate to ask Judge Thomas, what do you think of settled law, like Roe vs.
 Wade (legitimatizing abortion), what do you think of a woman's right to privacy, free speech issues, issues of freedom of religion." Civil rights groups have opposed Thomas on grounds he was insensitive to the concerns of minorities and the elderly as chairman of the federal Equal Employment Opportunities Commission in the 1980s. "The fact that he is an African-American should not be a basis for avoiding very careful scrutiny of his civil rights record," said Julius L.
 Potential opponents of the nominee promised in their statements to ignore Thomas' race when they examine his record. "The background of Judge Clarence Thomas is less important than his views and what they mean to protecting our constitutional rights," said Sen.
 When head of the EEOC during the Reagan administration, Thomas "seemed to go out of his way to find ways to weaken some of the basic civil rights protections," said Simon, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee.
 In a 1985 statement, Thomas said, "Federal enforcement agencies . . . turned the statutes on their heads by requiring discrimination in the form of hiring and promotion quotas, so-called goals and timetables." In a 1987 article for the Yale Law &amp; Policy Review he referred to affirmative action as "social engineering." "I don't want my vote to contribute to an increasingly large and conservative anti-choice majority on the Supreme Court," said Sen.
 Thomas said he looked forward to the confirmation process "and to be an example to those who are where I was, and to show them that, indeed, there is hope." Thomas declined to answer questions about his legal views until his hearings.; WHAT'S NEXT?
