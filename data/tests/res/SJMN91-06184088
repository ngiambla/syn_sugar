 Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., said "in the past few months alone the Supreme Court is throwing out past decisions, and I think it is legitimate to ask Judge Thomas, what do you think of settled law, like Roe vs.
 Wade (legitimatizing abortion), what do you think of a woman's right to privacy, free speech issues, issues of freedom of religion." Civil rights groups have opposed Thomas on grounds he was insensitive to the concerns of minorities and the elderly as chairman of the federal Equal Employment Opportunities Commission in the 1980s. "The fact that he is an African-American should not be a basis for avoiding very careful scrutiny of his civil rights record," said Julius L.
 Potential opponents of the nominee promised in their statements to ignore Thomas' race when they examine his record. "The background of Judge Clarence Thomas is less important than his views and what they mean to protecting our constitutional rights," said Sen.
