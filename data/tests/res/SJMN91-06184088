 Senate Democrats promised today to scrutinize Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas' views on abortion and other divisive issues.
 But Republicans said he should not divulge his feelings about controversies that might come before the court. "I'm satisfied that this man will pass muster," President Bush declared Monday in naming Thomas to succeed retiring Justice Thurgood Marshall.
 Conservatives applauded the selection and predicted liberals would have trouble opposing the black judge.
 Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, said the Senate Judiciary Committee, in confirming four justices without learning how they felt about abortion, has "given them a free ride" and should be tougher in ferreting out Thomas' views. "The failure to give an answer may cause me and others to be unwilling to vote for his confirmation," Metzenbaum said on "CBS This Morning." Sen.
 Arlen Specter, R-Pa., noted that Metzenbaum did not press Justice David Souter during confirmation hearings about his position on abortion. "I do not think it is appropriate to ask a nominee the ultimate question as to how he is going to decide a specific case," Specter said. "I will not support yet another Reagan-Bush Supreme Court nominee who remains silent on a woman's right to choose, and then ascends to the court to weaken that right," said Metzenbaum, the only member of the Judiciary Committee who voted against Thomas' nomination to the Circuit Court of Appeals to the District of Columbia.
