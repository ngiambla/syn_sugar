 Participants in Mexico believe the total eclipse, which will send a shadow racing from Hawaii to Brazil as the moon crosses directly in front of the sun, will cause volcanic eruptions, signaling Earthlings to start bailing out on spaceships to the fourth dimension, according to Intergalactic Guardian command leader "Angel," who declined to give a last name.
 While Angel and his followers meditate to prepare for their journey, French New Age musician Jean-Michel Jarre is coordinating an elaborate sound-and-light show to play at the foot of the pyramids in Teotihuacan, north of the capital.
 Also on E-day, July 11, crowded cruise ships will linger off Mexico's Pacific Coast, and thousands of U.S. tourists will drive south into Baja California, which, usually boasting clear skies, is being billed as the world's most promising site from which to view nature's own light show.
 Eclipse fans from Japan to New York to the Netherlands are expected in droves, but Californians -- because of their proximity to Baja and propensity for mystical phenomena -- should be conspicuous.
 However, the chic hot spot for eclipse watchers won't be Mexico, but the big island of Hawaii, where the 18,000 tourists who would be there anyway to enjoy the sunshine will be joined by an additional 30,000 or more coming to watch the sun go out for four minutes.
