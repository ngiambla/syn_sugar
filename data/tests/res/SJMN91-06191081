 A panel that investigated the Los Angeles Police Department after officers were videotaped beating a motorist has decided not to seek Chief Daryl Gates' resignation and neither blamed nor cleared him.
 A source speaking on the condition of anonymity said the panel report did not focus on Gates -- who said he would resign if the commission agreed with his critics that he created a climate within the department that condoned racism and brutality.
 Sources familiar with testimony and evidence presented to the panel told the Los Angeles Times that a number of racially derogatory messages sent on police car computer terminals have been cataloged.
