 A panel that investigated the Los Angeles Police Department after officers were videotaped beating a motorist has decided not to seek Chief Daryl Gates' resignation and neither blamed nor cleared him.
 But the 10-member commission, which was to release its report today, found racist and sexist remarks scattered throughout 90,000 pages of computer messages, sources said.
 A source speaking on the condition of anonymity said the panel report did not focus on Gates -- who said he would resign if the commission agreed with his critics that he created a climate within the department that condoned racism and brutality.
 Mayor Tom Bradley, who has asked Gates to step down, said through a spokesman he believed the report focused on police management, excessive force and civilian control.
 Sources familiar with testimony and evidence presented to the panel told the Los Angeles Times that a number of racially derogatory messages sent on police car computer terminals have been cataloged.
 One message, for which no context was provided, read: "It's monkey slapping time." The commission examined 90,000 pages of computer messages and found examples of racially and sexually "offensive" remarks scattered throughout.
 The transcripts contained a reference to an earlier incident involving black people, using the phrase "gorillas in the mist." At the same time, secret testimony by as many as a dozen black police officers told of numerous instances of racial harassment within the ranks and the existence of a double standard in the treatment of minority suspects.
 The American Civil Liberties Union and other groups called for Gates to resign after the March 3 incident in which white police officers repeatedly struck King with batons, kicked him and shocked him with a stun gun after pulling him over for speeding.
