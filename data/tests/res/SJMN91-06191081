 A panel that investigated the Los Angeles Police Department after officers were videotaped beating a motorist has decided not to seek Chief Daryl Gates' resignation and neither blamed nor cleared him.
 But the 10-member commission, which was to release its report today, found racist and sexist remarks scattered throughout 90,000 pages of computer messages, sources said.
 A source speaking on the condition of anonymity said the panel report did not focus on Gates -- who said he would resign if the commission agreed with his critics that he created a climate within the department that condoned racism and brutality.
 The report "deals with management issues, not directly with the chief of police," the source said.
 One message, for which no context was provided, read: "It's monkey slapping time." The commission examined 90,000 pages of computer messages and found examples of racially and sexually "offensive" remarks scattered throughout.
