 A panel that investigated the Los Angeles Police Department after officers were videotaped beating a motorist has decided not to seek Chief Daryl Gates' resignation and neither blamed nor cleared him.
 A source speaking on the condition of anonymity said the panel report did not focus on Gates -- who said he would resign if the commission agreed with his critics that he created a climate within the department that condoned racism and brutality.
 Mayor Tom Bradley, who has asked Gates to step down, said through a spokesman he believed the report focused on police management, excessive force and civilian control.
 One message, for which no context was provided, read: "It's monkey slapping time." The commission examined 90,000 pages of computer messages and found examples of racially and sexually "offensive" remarks scattered throughout.
 In another, an officer testified behind closed doors that he was present when a caravan of patrol cars raced through a housing project with "Ride of the Valkyries" blaring from loudspeakers -- a scene reminiscent of the movie "Apocalypse Now." The officers testified before the commission after being assured that their identities would be kept confidential.
