 In the United States, the opportunity has come twice in the past couple of decades -- along the East Coast in 1970 and across the Northwest and Northern Plains in 1979.
 Historic events For science, two eclipses have proved especially historic: In 1868, spectroscopic study of the sun's halo turned up evidence of a new element, which was named helium, from Helios, the Greek sun god.
 For one thing, chasing eclipses by trekking to remote regions with delicate astronomical instruments to capture a few minutes of data has lost much of its glamour, especially in times of tight budgets.
 They hope the information will provide clues to what causes the sun's 11-year cycle of sunspots and flares (now near its peak), what propels the solar wind and why the sun's outer atmosphere is, paradoxically, so much hotter than its lower atmosphere.
 Solar wind studies At some observatories, astronomers will take repeated photographs of the corona during the eclipse to study it close up and to watch for material accelerating outward to become solar wind.
