 It's a coincidence of cosmic proportions.
 The sun is 400 times wider than the moon.
 But the sun also happens to be about 400 times as far away from Earth as the moon.
 The result: From Earth both orbs look almost exactly the same size.
 In these cases the moon's shadow, up to 200 miles wide on the earth's surface, races west to east along the ground at 1,000 to 5,000 miles per hour for a few thousand miles.
