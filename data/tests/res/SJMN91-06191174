 In the United States, the opportunity has come twice in the past couple of decades -- along the East Coast in 1970 and across the Northwest and Northern Plains in 1979.
 Also, its 150-mile-wide path across Hawaii, Baja California, Mexico City and four Central American capital cities "puts more people in the moon's shadow than any other eclipse in history," says Alan Dyer, an editor of Astronomy magazine.
 Historic events For science, two eclipses have proved especially historic: In 1868, spectroscopic study of the sun's halo turned up evidence of a new element, which was named helium, from Helios, the Greek sun god.
 They hope the information will provide clues to what causes the sun's 11-year cycle of sunspots and flares (now near its peak), what propels the solar wind and why the sun's outer atmosphere is, paradoxically, so much hotter than its lower atmosphere.
 Solar wind studies At some observatories, astronomers will take repeated photographs of the corona during the eclipse to study it close up and to watch for material accelerating outward to become solar wind.
