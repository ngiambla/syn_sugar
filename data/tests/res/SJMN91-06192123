 One by one the customers filtered out of the Orion Telescope Center, eclipsing personal dignity in their zeal to view the sun through geeky, fluorescent-green paper eyeshades. "It works: I see the sun," exclaimed customer Jim Maurer as he peered at the Cupertino sky through his five-buck Startrap Eclipse Viewers. "But I can't see anything else. . . .
 But, oh, if only he and the hundreds of other customers could see themselves in the mirror, looking like an audience for a 3-D horror flick.
 Millions of Californians will pause Thursday morning to join in an international ritual: watching the longest-lasting solar eclipse until 2132. "What other natural phenomenon can you be involved in and not get killed?" said Bert Beecher, spokesman for the Minolta Planetarium at De Anza College. "It's a lot safer than being in a volcano." Eyeshades a hot item Bay Area people Tuesday were desperately seeking eyeshades.
 It took 24 hours for Orion Telescope in Cupertino to sell its stock of 900 Eclipse Viewers, which are made with Mylar plastic lenses and supposedly safe for eclipse viewing.
 Local planetariums and observatories were deluged with requests from people wanting to attend solar viewing sessions, even though the Bay Area will be privy only to a partial eclipse -- 63 percent coverage of the sun by the moon from 10:10 a.m. to 12:34 p.m.
 Flights heavily booked Flights from here to Mexico and Hawaii -- where the eclipse can be seen in total -- were heavily booked by sunstruck people spending thousands of dollars to stand in 6 minutes, 53 seconds of darkness.
 Scott Wiener, a computer company executive from Saratoga, is flying with two buddies to Baja, where thousands will toast the corona with Coronas. "I figure we'll get there in time to see the eclipse from a cab," said Wiener, who stood in line at the telescope store Tuesday for the Eclipse Viewers. "We'll put on the glasses and stick our heads out the window. "I figure it's worth it.
 I don't know if I'll be around for the next one in 150 years." WHERE TO WATCH; Here are places to view Thursday's solar eclipse:; The San Jose Astronomical Association will set up special telescopes at Branham Lane Park, near the intersection of Branham and Camden Avenue, from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m.
