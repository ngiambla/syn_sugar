 Their hopes had fallen and risen in the previous hour as the clouds came and went.; "I came especially for this, and hope we get to see it," said Margaret MacLeod, a mathematics and science teacher from Manhattan Beach shortly before the eclipse in Hawaii. "If we don't get to see it, I may have to go to Iraq for the next one."; Because of the clouds, most were unable to see the stages of the eclipse until it got totally dark.; In the Bay Area, though, mostly sunny skies made eclipse watching a treat, except along the coast, where it was obscured by fog.; Parks, parking lots, shopping centers, back yards and planetariums became Eclipsefests as the peak approached.; More than a hundred sun gazers showed up at the Branham Lane Park in south San Jose with almost as many gizmos to help them spot sunspots and watch the moon cross the sun.; There were funny Mylar glasses, big pinhole cameras, small pinhole cameras, welder's glass, welder's masks, binoculars projecting images onto cardboard and telescopes.; None was as impressive as Ralph Reeves' interference birefrigent hydrogen alpha filter telescope.
