 Shortly before 10:30 this morning California time, nature turned off the sun's light switch and darkness over Hawaii and Mexico signaled the beginning of the "The Eclipse of the Millennium." "Oh, my God," exclaimed one spectator after another at a mountaintop observatory atop Mauna Kea as the sky went dark.
 From Hawaii to Mexico to Central America, more than 40 million people saw the moon obscure so much of the sun that only a blazing ring was visible.
 In Hawaii, Mauna Loa erupted for the first time in six years, stunning scientists by releasing a dazzling fountain of lava at the height of the eclipse.
 It looks like someone took a bite out of an apple," said Matthew Mauranoh, 8, of Mountain View, who peered through a homemade black box at the Foothill Observatory.
 In the 160-mile-wide swath from Hawaii to Baja to Mexico to Brazil, the morning turned into night -- the only region where the eclipse made the Earth totally dark.
 Their hopes had fallen and risen in the previous hour as the clouds came and went. "I came especially for this, and hope we get to see it," said Margaret MacLeod, a mathematics and science teacher from Manhattan Beach shortly before the eclipse in Hawaii. "If we don't get to see it, I may have to go to Iraq for the next one." Because of the clouds, most were unable to see the stages of the eclipse until it got totally dark.
 More than a hundred sun gazers showed up at the Branham Lane Park in south San Jose with almost as many gizmos to help them spot sunspots and watch the moon cross the sun.
 That is, if you have film. "I didn't bring any film with me," said Reeves, a retired Lockheed instrument builder. "Isn't that awful?" At the Children's Discovery Museum in downtown San Jose, hundreds of youngsters and adults made cardboard telescopes, which projected the eclipse on white cards through a needle hole opening.
 Paul Stonecipher , a discovery museum staff guide, said, "We wanted to make little theaters for all of the kids to see the eclipse without burning their eyes." Using mirrors, the eclipse also was projected on the exterior walls of the lavendar-colored museum.
 There was even an eclipse haircut and, of course, an eclipse drink at the Eclipse restaurant in Kailua-Kona. "Everything is selling pretty well except for the eclipse Frisbees.
