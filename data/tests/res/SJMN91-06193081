 Shortly before 10:30 this morning California time, nature turned off the sun's light switch and darkness over Hawaii and Mexico signaled the beginning of the "The Eclipse of the Millennium." "Oh, my God," exclaimed one spectator after another at a mountaintop observatory atop Mauna Kea as the sky went dark.
 From Hawaii to Mexico to Central America, more than 40 million people saw the moon obscure so much of the sun that only a blazing ring was visible.
 In Hawaii, Mauna Loa erupted for the first time in six years, stunning scientists by releasing a dazzling fountain of lava at the height of the eclipse.
 In the 160-mile-wide swath from Hawaii to Baja to Mexico to Brazil, the morning turned into night -- the only region where the eclipse made the Earth totally dark.
 Their hopes had fallen and risen in the previous hour as the clouds came and went. "I came especially for this, and hope we get to see it," said Margaret MacLeod, a mathematics and science teacher from Manhattan Beach shortly before the eclipse in Hawaii. "If we don't get to see it, I may have to go to Iraq for the next one." Because of the clouds, most were unable to see the stages of the eclipse until it got totally dark.
 That is, if you have film. "I didn't bring any film with me," said Reeves, a retired Lockheed instrument builder. "Isn't that awful?" At the Children's Discovery Museum in downtown San Jose, hundreds of youngsters and adults made cardboard telescopes, which projected the eclipse on white cards through a needle hole opening.
 There was even an eclipse haircut and, of course, an eclipse drink at the Eclipse restaurant in Kailua-Kona. "Everything is selling pretty well except for the eclipse Frisbees.
