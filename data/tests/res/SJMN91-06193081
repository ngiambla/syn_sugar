 Shortly before 10:30 this morning California time, nature turned off the sun's light switch and darkness over Hawaii and Mexico signaled the beginning of the "The Eclipse of the Millennium." "Oh, my God," exclaimed one spectator after another at a mountaintop observatory atop Mauna Kea as the sky went dark.
 That is, if you have film. "I didn't bring any film with me," said Reeves, a retired Lockheed instrument builder. "Isn't that awful?" At the Children's Discovery Museum in downtown San Jose, hundreds of youngsters and adults made cardboard telescopes, which projected the eclipse on white cards through a needle hole opening.
 Paul Stonecipher , a discovery museum staff guide, said, "We wanted to make little theaters for all of the kids to see the eclipse without burning their eyes." Using mirrors, the eclipse also was projected on the exterior walls of the lavendar-colored museum.
