 The demonstrators, most associated with Operation Rescue, have charged and testified that police tactics used during the past 2 1/2 years in cities such as Denver, Atlanta, Pittsburgh and Los Angeles have resulted in serious injury and led to sexual abuse against women who have been arrested.; Operation Rescue, which draws participants largely from conservative Catholic and Protestant circles, is a national movement that organizes demonstrations at abortion facilities.
 It is the practice of the protesters to go limp when ordered to move but to otherwise offer no resistance to police.; The persistent complaints and numerous suits against police by Operation Rescue have taken on a new significance in recent months in the wake of the Los Angeles police beating of motorist Rodney King.; The images of Los Angeles police swinging nightsticks at King as he lay on the ground, played repeatedly on national news programs, were burned into the national conscience and led to widespread calls for investigation of police brutality.; But government agencies, the press and civil libertarians have reacted quite differently to Operation Rescue videos showing apparent police brutality and to reports of police abuse of hundreds of the activists across the country.; A videotape of an Operation Rescue demonstration shows a man's arm apparently snapping under the pressure of being lifted in a manner similar to that used on Lynch.
 The FBI investigated complaints of misconduct by members of his department, he said, and "every single case was closed."; He called pain compliance "a valid tool" used "in direct proportion to the amount of resistance." Even Gandhi and Martin Luther King Jr., when arrested, cooperated with police and the courts, he said.; Shortly after Rodney King's beating, a news program on ABC illustrating police brutality showed a still photo of police using a martial-arts weapon against a person being arrested, but there was no mention that the episode involved Operation Rescue.; Similarly, the CBS Evening News reported March 27 "on various aspects of police brutality" but did not include examples involving anti-abortion activists, a producer said.; "It (police abuse) has not attracted much attention because a lot of people are not sympathetic to Operation Rescue," said Dr.
