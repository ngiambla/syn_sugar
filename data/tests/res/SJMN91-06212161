 Hispanics, whose incidence of diabetes is two to three times as high as the population of the United States as a whole, can learn how to manage the illness at a free half-day clinic Saturday at St.
 Hispanics who have strong American Indian ancestry may be vulnerable to diabetes because about 50 percent of all Indians develop diabetes, McNamara said.
 Also, the high-fat diet of many Hispanics leads to obesity, which seems to trigger diabetes, McNamara said.
 You have to manage your own diabetes, and we're teaching people how to take care of themselves," McNamara said.
 The hospital and the diabetes society are sponsoring neighborhood diabetes programs for Hispanics, which are taught by bilingual instructors.
