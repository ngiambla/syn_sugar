 In the study, Nardell estimated that if outdoor air ventilation in the government building had been doubled -- to about 35 cubic feet per minute, a level that Massachusetts recommends for buildings where smoking is permitted -- only half as many workers would have been infected with tuberculosis.
 Other studies have documented:; (check) Flu spreads quickly on airplanes where ventilation systems consist entirely of recirculated air. (check) Measles are transmitted by infectious air in a pediatrician's waiting room. (check) Tuberculosis can spread in homeless shelters, prisons and hospitals where ventilation is poor.
 Flu spreads much more easily than TB. "It may survive several hours in dry air," says Vernon Knight, a respiratory virus disease expert at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston. "In those tight buildings, they continue to recirculate it, and they probably build up." Nardell and others recognize that the solution to this problem -- fixing or replacing ventilation systems to include more fresh air -- can be expensive.
