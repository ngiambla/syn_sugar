 Millions of American office workers are getting more than they bargained for when they inhale in a building that has no fresh air.
 The infection rate was as high in some distant parts of the building as it was next to the sick employee. "By recirculating the air, you spread it throughout the building," says Nardell. "People who had no direct contact with this case, might have been exposed in far reaches of the building." If tuberculosis can spread in poorly ventilated buildings, so can other infectious bugs.
 In the study, Nardell estimated that if outdoor air ventilation in the government building had been doubled -- to about 35 cubic feet per minute, a level that Massachusetts recommends for buildings where smoking is permitted -- only half as many workers would have been infected with tuberculosis.
 Other studies have documented:; (check) Flu spreads quickly on airplanes where ventilation systems consist entirely of recirculated air. (check) Measles are transmitted by infectious air in a pediatrician's waiting room. (check) Tuberculosis can spread in homeless shelters, prisons and hospitals where ventilation is poor.
 In his tuberculosis study, he found that the biggest benefit comes from improving the worst ventilation systems that allow very little fresh air.
