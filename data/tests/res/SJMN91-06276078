 So the infectious bugs that a worker exhales at one end of the building can end up, via the ventilation system, being inhaled at the other end. "The building is not the source.
 The infection rate was as high in some distant parts of the building as it was next to the sick employee. "By recirculating the air, you spread it throughout the building," says Nardell. "People who had no direct contact with this case, might have been exposed in far reaches of the building." If tuberculosis can spread in poorly ventilated buildings, so can other infectious bugs.
 In the study, Nardell estimated that if outdoor air ventilation in the government building had been doubled -- to about 35 cubic feet per minute, a level that Massachusetts recommends for buildings where smoking is permitted -- only half as many workers would have been infected with tuberculosis.
 Other studies have documented:; (check) Flu spreads quickly on airplanes where ventilation systems consist entirely of recirculated air. (check) Measles are transmitted by infectious air in a pediatrician's waiting room. (check) Tuberculosis can spread in homeless shelters, prisons and hospitals where ventilation is poor.
 If the ventilation is moderately effective but not ideal, further improvements yield only a slight decrease in infectious illness. "There's only so much you can do," Nardell says. "There's going to be a price of living together in a communal society." YOU'RE INTERESTEDEmployees who think that poor air quality at their workplace is contributing to health problems can call Cal-OSHA, a state agency that monitors worker safety and health.
