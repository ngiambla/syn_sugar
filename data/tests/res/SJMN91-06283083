 For months, this county's politically astute Sheriff Sherman Block maintained a low profile for himself and his department while city police were being hammered after the videotaped beating of black motorist Rodney King.
 Block's measured response to the criticism -- and the lack of a riveting videotape -- have spared him the level of heat felt by Police Chief Daryl Gates.
 There are 950 known street gangs with more than 99,300 members in the county, according to the sheriff's department.
