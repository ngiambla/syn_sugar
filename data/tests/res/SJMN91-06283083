 Like Gates before him, Block maintains his department is a good one with "a reputation as being one of the most progressive, one of the most professional, one of the finest law enforcement agencies." The sheriff has said that his department continually re-examines itself and launched several Christopher Commission recommendations before the commission even existed -- but that it can't do everything. 'A last-resort mechanism' "Law enforcement, and I'm going beyond the sheriff's department, did not create the social conditions out there from which the violence is springing," he said. "People are looking at the criminal justice system today as being the linchpins of government. . . . (But) We're a last-resort mechanism when other kinder and gentler processes fail in our society.
 And fail they have." Block pointed to social ills including high drop-out and illiteracy rates, "young people who are raising themselves," and a county jail system that is "perhaps the major houser of mentally ill people in our society in this nation." Countywide, homicides soared to 1,964 last year, compared with 1,463 five years earlier.
 Agreeing that law enforcement is not the answer to all of society's failures, critics say Block is missing the point. "Police brutality (or) racism is not a social problem, it's a law enforcement lack of leadership," the Hoover Institution's McNamara said. "The basic goal and mission of law enforcement people is to reduce conflict in the community. . . .
 The rhetoric of the Los Angeles police establishment through the years seems to have escalated conflict, not lowered it." The FBI, Amnesty International and the county grand jury are investigating allegations about both departments.
 Besides a new police chief, the ACLU's Hicks predicted only "some window dressing and some moderate changes made to training." On the county side, critics say Block's position as an elected official insulates him from the kind of independent review the city was able to order for the police department.
