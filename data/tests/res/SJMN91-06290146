 As the climactic votes that put her son on the Supreme Court were cast hundreds of miles away in Washington, Leola Williams jumped from her chair, hugged a neighbor and then began to sing a spiritual, "Jesus Keep Me Near the Cross." Never had she doubted the outcome, Williams said a short time later. "I didn't give my child up and I never would," she said.
 Then she excused herself to place a phone call to her son, Clarence Thomas.
 What would she tell him? "I love you." And, a reporter asked, what would she say to Anita Hill if she had the chance? "I'd tell her to pray," she replied. "She needs God bad.
 But, whoever put her up to it, I just pray she'll get her life straightened out." In Thomas' birthplace, the hometown crowd has made no attempt to disguise where its heart lies.
 A handwritten sign on the main thoroughfare announces: "Pinpoint Georgia, the home of Judge Clarence Thomas." Not surprisingly, no one here seemed to believe Hill's allegation that Thomas had sexually harassed her between 1981 and 1983 while she worked for him.
