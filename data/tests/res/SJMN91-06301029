 It's in Los Altos Hills, where residents in 1984 repealed an ordinance requiring fire-retardant roofs; a year later, a fire destroyed 100 acres and 12 homes, many of which have been rebuilt -- with the same flammable shake roofs.
 Instead, as they drive by, some firefighters make mental notes about which homes would be worth saving. "You do this evaluation of what you think you'd be effective at salvaging," said Don Shaw, a battalion chief for the Palo Alto Fire Department.
 By not trimming dense brush, he said, some homeowners are "virtually signing a death warrant." And increasingly, fire officials worry about wildfires spreading into even more heavily populated areas at the base of the foothills, where numerous trees create an "urban forest." "We could have a fire going from rooftop to treetop to rooftop to treetop in any number of areas in this city, if the weather conditions are right," said San Jose Fire Chief Robert Osby.
 Challenge for firefighters Many of the South Bay's most vulnerable areas -- such as Redwood Estates above Los Gatos and Emerald Lake Hills above Redwood City -- began as colonies of summer homes, a handful of secluded cottages strung along narrow winding roads.
 Now, these communities are the year-round home for thousands, often still dependent on volunteer firefighters and an overtaxed network of roads and water lines. "On a good day, trying to maneuver fire apparatus on those roads is tough," said Steve Cavallero, a battalion chief for the Redwood City Fire Department, which covers a portion of Emerald Lake Hills. "Combine that with panic, with people getting out of the way, and you're setting the stage for disaster." An estimated 25,000 people live in the communities along Highway 9 between Santa Cruz and Boulder Creek, the curvy, two-lane road that would be the only way out in the case of a major fire.
