 It's in the mountain communities that straddle Highway 9 in Santa Cruz County, isolated by weak bridges that won't support some firetrucks and connected by a two-lane road that will hinder escape.
 It's in Los Altos Hills, where residents in 1984 repealed an ordinance requiring fire-retardant roofs; a year later, a fire destroyed 100 acres and 12 homes, many of which have been rebuilt -- with the same flammable shake roofs.
 And the risk is increasing, as cramped Bay Area residents push farther into the hills and canyons in search of living space and rural atmosphere.
 Instead of an eight- or 10-inch water main ensuring pressure for fire hoses, the mountains are laced with two-inch pipes. "Those are the risks you take when you live in an area like this," said Dean Lucke, chief of the forestry department's San Mateo-Santa Cruz ranger unit. "We can't guarantee everyone's safety up here at all times." In general, firefighters say, the heavily wooded Santa Cruz Mountains are more susceptible to major fires than the grass-covered eastern foothills.
 By not trimming dense brush, he said, some homeowners are "virtually signing a death warrant." And increasingly, fire officials worry about wildfires spreading into even more heavily populated areas at the base of the foothills, where numerous trees create an "urban forest." "We could have a fire going from rooftop to treetop to rooftop to treetop in any number of areas in this city, if the weather conditions are right," said San Jose Fire Chief Robert Osby.
