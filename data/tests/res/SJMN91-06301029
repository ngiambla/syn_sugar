 Uncertain water.; The conditions are familiar to South Bay firefighters, who know they may be no more than a careless match away from a blaze as intense and unpredictable as the one that devastated the Oakland hills last Sunday. </LEADPARA> <SECTION> Front </SECTION> <HEADLINE> WHY IT COULD HAPPEN HERE CONDITIONS IN SOUTH BAY HILLS MIRROR DEADLY MIX </HEADLINE> <MEMO> The Oakland Hills Fire; See also related stories on pages 1A and 21-24A of this section. </MEMO> <TEXT> Now, in the wake of that firestorm, local firefighters are looking up at the hills that surround this area and wondering not whether, but only when and where.; "I know it's there," said Saratoga Fire Chief Ernest Kraule. "Every fire chief -- there's 12 of us in this county -- knows it's there."; The danger is in the Saratoga foothills, where Kraule's department has battled nine deliberately set fires since June -- most recently Oct. 19, the same day Oakland firefighters thought they had contained a brush fire that a day later blossomed into the deadly firestorm.; It's in the mountain communities that straddle Highway 9 in Santa Cruz County, isolated by weak bridges that won't support some firetrucks and connected by a two-lane road that will hinder escape.; It's in Los Altos Hills, where residents in 1984 repealed an ordinance requiring fire-retardant roofs; a year later, a fire destroyed 100 acres and 12 homes, many of which have been rebuilt -- with the same flammable shake roofs.; In fact, the danger of an Oakland-like inferno is in almost all of the hills that ring the South Bay, where homes often are surrounded by dense brush or stately trees, the fuel of rapidly spreading wildfires.; And the risk is increasing, as cramped Bay Area residents push farther into the hills and canyons in search of living space and rural atmosphere.
