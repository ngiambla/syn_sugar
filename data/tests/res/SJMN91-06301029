 The conditions are familiar to South Bay firefighters, who know they may be no more than a careless match away from a blaze as intense and unpredictable as the one that devastated the Oakland hills last Sunday.
 Now, in the wake of that firestorm, local firefighters are looking up at the hills that surround this area and wondering not whether, but only when and where. "I know it's there," said Saratoga Fire Chief Ernest Kraule. "Every fire chief -- there's 12 of us in this county -- knows it's there." The danger is in the Saratoga foothills, where Kraule's department has battled nine deliberately set fires since June -- most recently Oct. 19, the same day Oakland firefighters thought they had contained a brush fire that a day later blossomed into the deadly firestorm.
 It's in Los Altos Hills, where residents in 1984 repealed an ordinance requiring fire-retardant roofs; a year later, a fire destroyed 100 acres and 12 homes, many of which have been rebuilt -- with the same flammable shake roofs.
 State officials say it's no coincidence that six of California's 10 most damaging wildfires have occurred since 1980. "The tendency is to have bigger fires that are much more expensive to put out, with much more property loss," said Roy Pike, a deputy chief in the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection's Santa Rosa office.
 Instead of an eight- or 10-inch water main ensuring pressure for fire hoses, the mountains are laced with two-inch pipes. "Those are the risks you take when you live in an area like this," said Dean Lucke, chief of the forestry department's San Mateo-Santa Cruz ranger unit. "We can't guarantee everyone's safety up here at all times." In general, firefighters say, the heavily wooded Santa Cruz Mountains are more susceptible to major fires than the grass-covered eastern foothills.
 By not trimming dense brush, he said, some homeowners are "virtually signing a death warrant." And increasingly, fire officials worry about wildfires spreading into even more heavily populated areas at the base of the foothills, where numerous trees create an "urban forest." "We could have a fire going from rooftop to treetop to rooftop to treetop in any number of areas in this city, if the weather conditions are right," said San Jose Fire Chief Robert Osby.
 Challenge for firefighters Many of the South Bay's most vulnerable areas -- such as Redwood Estates above Los Gatos and Emerald Lake Hills above Redwood City -- began as colonies of summer homes, a handful of secluded cottages strung along narrow winding roads.
 Now, these communities are the year-round home for thousands, often still dependent on volunteer firefighters and an overtaxed network of roads and water lines. "On a good day, trying to maneuver fire apparatus on those roads is tough," said Steve Cavallero, a battalion chief for the Redwood City Fire Department, which covers a portion of Emerald Lake Hills. "Combine that with panic, with people getting out of the way, and you're setting the stage for disaster." An estimated 25,000 people live in the communities along Highway 9 between Santa Cruz and Boulder Creek, the curvy, two-lane road that would be the only way out in the case of a major fire.
 That could happen even in urbanized areas of Santa Clara County because the major water suppliers rely on a similar system of electric pumps to maintain water pressure in the foothills. "We would face the same situation," said Sharon Whaley, spokeswoman for the San Jose Water Co., which serves foothill areas in Los Gatos, Saratoga and Almaden.
 To Mike Balesteri, chief of the forestry department ranger unit in Santa Clara County, the lesson is simple: "It's either bring your own water or find your own water in our game." Taps would go dry quickly Even when rural communities have upgraded their water systems -- as Redwood Estates did -- firefighters say the taps would start to run low if three or four houses were burning at once.
