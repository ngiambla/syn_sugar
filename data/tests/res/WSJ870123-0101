 In his State of the Union address last January, President Reagan announced that welfare reform would be a priority of his administration in its final three years.
 He instructed his charges to draw up plans for "immediate action" that would enable poor families to achieve "real and lasting emancipation" from welfare dependency. "The success of welfare," he said, "should be judged by how many of its recipients become independent of welfare." The president's convincing message raised hopes that something would finally be done to break the cycle of poverty and dependency that afflicts several million welfare families.
 Americans have become increasingly exasperated by the enormous amount of money the federal government devotes each year to anti-poverty programs, with little apparent abatement in poverty.
 If the president lets up on welfare reform, he will disappoint those whose hopes he raised last January, a group that surely includes many of the poor who understand better than any politician how deficient the current system is.
 To build on the momentum he created a year ago, the president must make plain his commitment in the State of the Union message next Tuesday.
 The president and the governors should be natural allies on this issue, and the chances of success would be enhanced if they could jointly commit themselves to a plan of action.
 The Democrats have long been beholden to the welfare lobby, whose interests now have less to do with alleviating poverty than with enlarging the welfare bureaucracy.
 This past December, a coalition of some 80 organizations, most with headquarters in Washington, issued a "statement of principles" calling for increased spending for poverty and jobs programs.
 It will be difficult for Congress to sell restored or additional spending on current poverty programs when the American people are already spending more than $100 billion a year on these programs.
 With the alliance of reform-minded governors and the support of the public, the president can press Congress to move off the deadening status quo.
