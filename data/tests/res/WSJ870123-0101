 WSJ870123-0101 REVIEW &amp; OUTLOOK (Editorial): Wither Welfare Reform? 01/23/87 WALL STREET JOURNAL (J) GOVMT FINANCIAL, INSURANCE, MUTUAL FUNDS, ACCOUNTING, LEASING (FIN) EXECUTIVE (EXE) CONGRESS (CNG) In his State of the Union address last January, President Reagan announced that welfare reform would be a priority of his administration in its final three years.
 He instructed his charges to draw up plans for "immediate action" that would enable poor families to achieve "real and lasting emancipation" from welfare dependency. "The success of welfare," he said, "should be judged by how many of its recipients become independent of welfare." The president's convincing message raised hopes that something would finally be done to break the cycle of poverty and dependency that afflicts several million welfare families.
 If the president lets up on welfare reform, he will disappoint those whose hopes he raised last January, a group that surely includes many of the poor who understand better than any politician how deficient the current system is.
