 In his State of the Union address last January, President Reagan announced that welfare reform would be a priority of his administration in its final three years.
 If the president lets up on welfare reform, he will disappoint those whose hopes he raised last January, a group that surely includes many of the poor who understand better than any politician how deficient the current system is.
 The president and the governors should be natural allies on this issue, and the chances of success would be enhanced if they could jointly commit themselves to a plan of action.
 The president will need all the help he can get if he is to convince Democrats in Congress to go along.
 It will be difficult for Congress to sell restored or additional spending on current poverty programs when the American people are already spending more than $100 billion a year on these programs.
