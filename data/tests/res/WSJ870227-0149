 Now the nation's governors are asking Washington to adopt their plan.
 Meeting this week in Washington, the governors said they want to transform the current welfare system -- largely an income-maintenance system -- into more of a job-support system.
 They would require all able-bodied welfare recipients (except mothers with children under 3 years of age) to work in exchange for their benefits.
 Substantial numbers of welfare recipients have moved into jobs and off the public rolls.
 These successes have encouraged the governors of New York, New Jersey, Washington and Missouri to undertake their own reform programs.
