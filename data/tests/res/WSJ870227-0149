 Now the nation's governors are asking Washington to adopt their plan.
 The most unattractive feature of the governors' welfare plan is its price tag -- up to $2 billion a year on top of the $100 billion-plus already devoted to assorted anti-poverty programs.
 The governors argue that by spending the extra $2 billion a year, the federal government would be making an investment.
 Nonetheless there is merit in the governors' plan, as there is in the administration's reform proposals, and in the reform bills under consideration in the Senate.
 The degree of consensus forming around welfare reform is unusual.
