 The White House has a formula for welfare reform, as do Sens.
 Meeting this week in Washington, the governors said they want to transform the current welfare system -- largely an income-maintenance system -- into more of a job-support system.
 They would require all able-bodied welfare recipients (except mothers with children under 3 years of age) to work in exchange for their benefits.
 Those who do would be eligible for help with education and training, day care and transportation.
 These successes have encouraged the governors of New York, New Jersey, Washington and Missouri to undertake their own reform programs.
 Bill Clinton of Arkansas, even backed off earlier criticism of the administration's welfare plan, saying after the White House meeting, "I feel better about the prospects of welfare reform than I did yesterday." That is not to say the president agreed with the governors on every count.
