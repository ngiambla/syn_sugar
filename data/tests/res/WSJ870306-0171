 De Beers helped with an advertising and promotion budget that swelled to $110 million this year, up from $43 million in 1980.
 De Beers's Central Selling Organization, known as the Syndicate, is the pipeline between diamond mines and dealers based mainly in Antwerp, Belgium; Bombay, India; Tel Aviv, Israel, and New York.
 The Syndicate has purchase contracts with De Beers's own mines in South Africa and Namibia (a territory controlled by South Africa), other African states such as Botswana, Zaire and Sierra Leone, and Australia.
 Some analysts warn, however, that De Beers's future may be affected by the surge in diamond output elsewhere, notably Australia.
 About 20% of the prize diamonds are produced in southern Africa, but the market is being flooded by cheaper diamonds mainly from Australia and Zaire.
