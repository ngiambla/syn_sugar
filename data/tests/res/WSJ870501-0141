 WSJ870501-0141 The Americas: Peruvian Rebels Supplant Army as Shield for Drug Producers --- By Tyler Bridges 05/01/87 WALL STREET JOURNAL (J) LATAM AUCAYACU, Peru In the late 1970s, poor farmers living in communities surrounding this small town began replacing their fields of cacao and coffee with coca to meet the growing U.S. demand for cocaine.
 Like thousands of other farmers in Peru's Upper Huallaga Valley, they discovered that while cacao and coffee could give their families enough to eat, coca could make them rich.
 Lately, someone else has been attracted by its big profits: the country's murderous guerrillas, the Shining Path.
 Development workers, farmers and priests in the area say that the rebels have steadily streamed into the Upper Huallaga, a vast stretch of jungle northeast of Lima, and the biggest coca-growing zone in the world.
 Anti-drug police, Upper Huallaga residents and Interior Ministry officials report that army officers received hundreds of thousands of dollars in payoffs from drug lords for their help in keeping anti-drug officials at bay. "It's better for the 'narcos' when the army is here," says one UMOPAR officer.
