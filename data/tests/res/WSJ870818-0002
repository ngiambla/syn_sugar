 Northwest Jet That Crashed in Detroit Had Engine Problems in Prior Years --- A Wall Street Journal News Roundup 08/18/87 WALL STREET JOURNAL (J) NWA UTX AIRLINES (AIR) TRANSPORTATION DEPARTMENT (TRN) CONGRESS (CNG) The Northwest Airlines jet that crashed Sunday in Detroit, killing at least 154 people, was involved in two incidents of engine failure in the past two years.
 MD-82 jet made emergency landings in 1985 and 1986 following the loss of power in one of its two engines.
 A Northwest spokesman confirmed that the incidents happened, but said they weren't related to Sunday's crash of Flight 255.
 Though federal investigators were looking into a number of possible causes for the crash, which occurred shortly after takeoff, engine failure appeared to be a likely culprit.
 Moreover, although service problems have been the focus of much of the attention in recent months, the debate may now center more strongly on safety issues. "There is going to be a lot of noise from Capitol Hill," said John Galipault, president of the Aviation Safety Institute. "This one is going under the microscope." Added a Senate Commerce Committee staff member: "Delays and other consumer concerns will end up in the back seat." In Detroit, federal crash inspectors and representatives of United Technologies Corp.'s Pratt &amp; Whitney unit, the engine maker, arrived at the accident scene.
