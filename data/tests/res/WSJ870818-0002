 According to Federal Aviation Administration records, the McDonnell Douglas Corp.
 MD-82 jet made emergency landings in 1985 and 1986 following the loss of power in one of its two engines.
 A Northwest spokesman confirmed that the incidents happened, but said they weren't related to Sunday's crash of Flight 255.
 Though federal investigators were looking into a number of possible causes for the crash, which occurred shortly after takeoff, engine failure appeared to be a likely culprit.
 According to Associated Press reports, some witnesses to the crash, including an air traffic controller, said they saw blue flame coming from one of the jetliner's engines just before it hit the ground and exploded into a fireball.
 The accident, the second-deadliest ever in the U.S., could have a broad range of effects on the airline industry regardless of the specific causes, aviation specialists said.
 Following a summer of near-misses, delays and other snafus, some airline specialists said the accident could serve as a catalyst for a reassessment of the nation's air-travel system.
 Moreover, although service problems have been the focus of much of the attention in recent months, the debate may now center more strongly on safety issues. "There is going to be a lot of noise from Capitol Hill," said John Galipault, president of the Aviation Safety Institute. "This one is going under the microscope." Added a Senate Commerce Committee staff member: "Delays and other consumer concerns will end up in the back seat." In Detroit, federal crash inspectors and representatives of United Technologies Corp.'s Pratt &amp; Whitney unit, the engine maker, arrived at the accident scene.
 The MD-82 jet, which has a good safety record, is designed to be able to take off and land even if one engine fails.
 In April, the National Transportation Safety Board urged the FAA to conduct a safety investigation of the 200 series of JT8D engines after some dangerous in-flight engine failures.
 The board made the recommendation after a March 23 incident in which an American Airlines MD-82 plane approaching the Minneapolis airport experienced an engine surge and loss of power.
