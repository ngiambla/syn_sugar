 Only about 10% to 20% of the diamonds are gems, but De Beers must continue to find new markets, they say.
 De Beers surprised skeptics and revived trade from the slump in the first half of the decade by withholding stocks and pursuing an intensive marketing campaign.
 In 1979, about 42 million pieces valued at $16 billion were sold, De Beers says.
