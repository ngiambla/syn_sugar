 This is the question the House of Representatives is scheduled to take up today when it votes on the Family Welfare Reform Act of 1987.
 The bill proposes $5.2 billion in new spending over five years, and most of that will increase benefits currently received by welfare recipients.

 At the same time they say, certain existing benefits -- mainly Aid to Families With Dependent Children (AFDC) -- must be increased to offset real declines since the base year of 1970.
 The bulk of the new money would go to higher AFDC pay-outs, extension of mandatory benefits to two-parent families and maintenance of certain benefits for welfare recipients earning some income.
