 This is the question the House of Representatives is scheduled to take up today when it votes on the Family Welfare Reform Act of 1987.
 The bill proposes $5.2 billion in new spending over five years, and most of that will increase benefits currently received by welfare recipients.
 It appears that what we have here is something of a Trojan horse -- a piece of legislation that is represented as "reform" when all it does is expand existing welfare programs.
 The bill's questionable premise is that larger expenditures on welfare will reduce welfare dependency.
 They point out that part of the money will go for special education, training and work programs for welfare mothers, to induce them off the rolls and into jobs.
 At the same time they say, certain existing benefits -- mainly Aid to Families With Dependent Children (AFDC) -- must be increased to offset real declines since the base year of 1970.
 The bulk of the new money would go to higher AFDC pay-outs, extension of mandatory benefits to two-parent families and maintenance of certain benefits for welfare recipients earning some income.
