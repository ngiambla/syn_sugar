 Bank of Boston Corp.'s decision to treat its Third World loans much more conservatively is expected to have significant domestic and international repercussions, bankers and analysts say.
 Domestically, the move reflects the competitive advantage that regional banks with large loan-loss reserves have over their big brothers in such money centers as New York, Chicago and San Francisco.
 Internationally, it appears that it will be even more difficult for economically troubled developing nations to attract new bank loans.
 On one hand, there is a small group of money-center banks with comparatively thin reserves against large loans to developing countries.
 The Bank of Boston decision "may well drive a wedge between the money-center banks and the regional banks," adds James J.
