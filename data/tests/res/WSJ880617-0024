 If the drought continues, he says, "it could bring us to our knees again." In Franklin, Tenn., implement dealer Larry Holt is slashing his fall orders by one-third, even though sales so far this year are up roughly 25%.
 He said that if the drought continues, industrywide tractor sales could turn flat next year instead of climbing the 5% to 6% that was originally forecast for 1989.
 Among rural banks, loan problems are expected to rise and profits to fall. "Before the drought we expected a very solid year" for farm lenders, says Mark Drabenstott, an economist at the Kansas City Federal Reserve Bank. "There are a lot of question marks right now." Many rural lenders this spring were banking on farmers losing some of their post-farm crisis inhibitions about going into hock.
 One of the biggest problems for farm banks has been that their number of loans, a major source of bank income, has shriveled as farmers paid off their debts with last year's profits.
 Because of the drought, Iowa realtors expect land prices to rise somewhat less than the 5% to 10% they had been expecting. "Everybody has just kind of pulled in their horns," says Jim Frevert, vice president of Hertz Farm Management Inc., Nevada, Iowa.
