 WSJ880621-0079 Under Fire: World Bank's Conable Runs Into Criticism On Poor Nations' Debt --- Liberals Assail His Refusal To Give Much Assistance; He Defends His Policies --- One Issue: His Ties to Baker Walter S.

 Bradley, worried that the debt burden stalls growth and threatens political stability in developing countries, proposes that Third World debtors be required to make certain economic reforms; in return, their lending banks would forgive some of the loans and write them down on their books.
