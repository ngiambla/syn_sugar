 John LaFalce, a New York Democrat and another leader on the issue, agrees. "There surely is a much larger role for the World Bank in the debt problem than it has played so far, but they just can't get out ahead of the administration," he says.
 He has clung to the bank's traditional role of a conventional lender and adviser to developing nations and has deferred on ideas about the debt to the man who picked him for his job -- U.S.
 Recently, commercial-bank lenders to Brazil tried to get the World Bank to insure a portion of a big new loan package they were negotiating.
 Clausen, his successor, it increased its loans to finance structural adjustments -- rather than specific development projects -- in Third World economies and also disbursed money more quickly.
 But the new money is being swamped by interest payments, and commercial banks are putting up little new money of their own.
