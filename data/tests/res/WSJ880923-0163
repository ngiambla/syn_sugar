 The scorched hillside around him appears utterly lifeless.
 Almost everything in sight is black, from the tips of trees 40 feet above the ground to the powdered ash blanketing the earth.
 The firestorm that raged through here in recent weeks was driven by 60-mile-an-hour winds that fanned temperatures to more than 1,600 degrees Fahrenheit.
 The fire was so intense that a gray shadow on the forest floor is all that remains of a fallen log.
 Where many people recoil at the sweep of nature's destructive power, the 47-year-old Mr.
 Despain marvels at the tiny steps life is already taking to renew itself.
 As Yellowstone National Park's research biologist, he has already begun to monitor the forest's rebirth from the worst fire on record.
 Despain patiently counts the quarter-inch lodgepole pine seed "wings" within a rectangular frame he places on the hillside.
 The tiny seeds are slowly released from rock-hard pine cones only after the cones have been seared by the passing flames; indeed, they require a fire to propagate themselves.
 The little wings act like the rotary blades of a helicopter in dispersing the seeds. "This is amazing," says Mr.
 Despain, reflecting on his count. "This works out to one million seeds an acre." Only about 500 mature trees were on an acre of hillside here before the fire.
 But next spring many of the seeds, fertilized by nutrients leaching into the soil from the snow-packed ash, will sprout, along with a bouquet of grasses, flowers and shrubs, as burnt areas of the park erupt with life.
 The profusion of pine seeds is just one of the rejuvenating forces at work in Yellowstone even as the fires, largely quenched this week by rain and snow, still smolder.
 Grasses and several types of wildflowers, ranging from fireweed to wild geraniums, are already sprouting less than seven weeks after fire roared past Grant Village near Yellowstone Lake.
 Next year, the ground cover replacing the park's burnt stands of aging lodgepole pines should provide a 30-fold increase in plant species.
 The National Park Service has already been at the center of a much-publicized political firestorm over its 16-year-old "natural burn" policy, which allows lightning-caused fires to burn themselves out, except where they threaten towns or park buildings.
 Critics, including elected officials from Western states and the logging and tourist industries, have grabbed headlines by blaming that policy for fueling the inferno that this summer raged over half of Yellowstone's 2.2 million acres and cost more than $100 million to fight and clean up.
 In an average year, 2.5 million tourists visit the huge park, and a drop-off because of the fire damage could severely hurt business.
 Driving along the 140 miles of the park's upper and lower scenic loop -- on roads open to park visitors -- one sees a Yellowstone that is a patchwork of green, brown and blackened forest and meadow.
