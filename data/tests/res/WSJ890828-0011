 A majority of the members of the House of Representatives has signaled support. "It is wrong to apportion congressional seats by counting people who would be deported if our immigration laws were enforced," Rep.
 Wisconsin has few illegal immigrants; Arizona has lots. "It boils down to regional politics," says Arturo Vargas, census-program director for the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, one of several Hispanic organizations lobbying in favor of counting illegal immigrants.
 Counting illegal immigrants in 1990 is likely to mean one less seat in the House for Pennsylvania and one more for California, according to the private Population Reference Bureau.
 On the other hand, Texas, Florida and New York could benefit. "Illegal aliens are actually taking representation away from Americans," says David Ray, spokesman for the Federation for American Immigration Reform.
 The Census Bureau, based on comparisons of its data with figures kept by the Immigration and Naturalization Service, estimates that it counted about two million illegal immigrants in 1980, half of them in California.
 That meant one extra seat in the House for California and New York and one less seat for Indiana and Georgia. "You end up diluting the vote when you start including illegals," says Rep.
 They fear that any attempt to ascertain the legal status of respondents will exacerbate difficulties the Census Bureau already faces in accurately counting Hispanics and blacks. "As it is, the Census Bureau has a tremendous challenge in trying to convince everybody that the census is confidential," Mr.
 Vargas says. "If the Census Bureau attempts to ask people their immigration status, that's going to be even harder." The Census Bureau agrees. "We tell people: Put your name down on the census form.
 The House did open the door to an amendment to a spending bill that would have barred census takers from "knowingly" counting any illegal immigrants, but the provision was quickly sidetracked on procedural grounds.
 Those in Congress and at the Census Bureau who favor continuing the practice of counting all residents of the U.S. conclude that this language unambiguously resolves the debate.
