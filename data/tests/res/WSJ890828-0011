 Wisconsin has few illegal immigrants; Arizona has lots. "It boils down to regional politics," says Arturo Vargas, census-program director for the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, one of several Hispanic organizations lobbying in favor of counting illegal immigrants.
 The Census Bureau, based on comparisons of its data with figures kept by the Immigration and Naturalization Service, estimates that it counted about two million illegal immigrants in 1980, half of them in California.
 That meant one extra seat in the House for California and New York and one less seat for Indiana and Georgia. "You end up diluting the vote when you start including illegals," says Rep.
 Vargas says. "If the Census Bureau attempts to ask people their immigration status, that's going to be even harder." The Census Bureau agrees. "We tell people: Put your name down on the census form.
 The House did open the door to an amendment to a spending bill that would have barred census takers from "knowingly" counting any illegal immigrants, but the provision was quickly sidetracked on procedural grounds.
