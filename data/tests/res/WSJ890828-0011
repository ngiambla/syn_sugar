 Though the forms for the 1990 census are already at the printers, Congress is contemplating adding a question: Are you an illegal immigrant?
 But the Senate already has voted to force the Census Bureau to exclude illegal immigrants in preparing tallies for congressional reapportionment.
 A majority of the members of the House of Representatives has signaled support. "It is wrong to apportion congressional seats by counting people who would be deported if our immigration laws were enforced," Rep.
 The Census Bureau, based on comparisons of its data with figures kept by the Immigration and Naturalization Service, estimates that it counted about two million illegal immigrants in 1980, half of them in California.
 That meant one extra seat in the House for California and New York and one less seat for Indiana and Georgia. "You end up diluting the vote when you start including illegals," says Rep.
