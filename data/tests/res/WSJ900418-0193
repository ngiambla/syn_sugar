 Now a detailed New York Times/CBS poll has found that Members of Congress may be the only demographic group in the country that doesn't favor limits on terms.
 The rest of the country is frustrated with a legislature where the turnover is about that of the non-elected British House of Lords.

 The root of the problems with Congress is that, barring major scandal, it is almost impossible to defeat an incumbent.
 In the past three elections, 96% or more of House incumbents who ran won.
