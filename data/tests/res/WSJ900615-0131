 And although the project's estimated cost has soared to #7.66 billion ($13.11 billion) from #4.9 billion, tunnel executives have obtained underwriting for an equity rights offer and preliminary agreement for more bank loans to cover the added cost. "There will be no more talk of crisis," says Alastair Morton, chief executive officer of Eurotunnel PLC, the consortium building the cross-channel link. "The money will be together this year, and the project will be clear from there." But the lack of a high-speed rail link to London, and improved service beyond, means Britain may miss out on the tunnel's total benefits. "There is a danger of not being able to exploit the tunnel to its full potential," says Prof.
 Passengers boarding high-speed trains in Paris will zoom at 180 miles an hour north to Calais, slow to 100 miles an hour through the tunnel, then crawl at an average of 60 miles an hour across southeast England's crowded commuter belt. "The traffic will now speed through as far as our side of the tunnel, and then the men with red flags will lead it on to London," complains Keith Speed, a Conservative member of Parliament whose constituency is near the tunnel terminal.
 The high-speed link "will be a benefit for us," he says, "but essential for the country." Some analysts go further, arguing the tunnel indeed needs better rail links if it is to compete with improving ferry and air services. "A high-speed link which covers {only} part of the route proves to be fairly uncompetitive with other transportation modes," says Bill Steinmetz, vice president of transport for consultants Booz-Allen &amp; Hamilton Inc. in London. "If you're going to build high-speed rail, you have to decide how to provide complete links.
