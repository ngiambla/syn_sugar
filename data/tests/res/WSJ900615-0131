 Just as prospects brighten for the beleaguered "chunnel," Britain risks failing to take full advantage of the cross-channel link.
 The Thatcher government's announcement yesterday that it wouldn't help fund a high-speed rail link between London and the tunnel has fueled fears that the country's creaky transportation system will isolate Britain on the periphery of Europe.
 Sarah Talbot-Williams, a spokeswoman for the Confederation of British Industry, Britain's main employers' group says, "1992 is going to produce a much more competitive market. "If we don't have the infrastructure to get the goods to Europe, we'll continue our status as an island." Long plagued by soaring costs and drilling delays, the tunnel now looks set to open on time in June 1993.
 And although the project's estimated cost has soared to #7.66 billion ($13.11 billion) from #4.9 billion, tunnel executives have obtained underwriting for an equity rights offer and preliminary agreement for more bank loans to cover the added cost. "There will be no more talk of crisis," says Alastair Morton, chief executive officer of Eurotunnel PLC, the consortium building the cross-channel link. "The money will be together this year, and the project will be clear from there." But the lack of a high-speed rail link to London, and improved service beyond, means Britain may miss out on the tunnel's total benefits. "There is a danger of not being able to exploit the tunnel to its full potential," says Prof.
 The high-speed link "will be a benefit for us," he says, "but essential for the country." Some analysts go further, arguing the tunnel indeed needs better rail links if it is to compete with improving ferry and air services. "A high-speed link which covers {only} part of the route proves to be fairly uncompetitive with other transportation modes," says Bill Steinmetz, vice president of transport for consultants Booz-Allen &amp; Hamilton Inc. in London. "If you're going to build high-speed rail, you have to decide how to provide complete links.
