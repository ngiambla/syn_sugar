 The Thatcher government's announcement yesterday that it wouldn't help fund a high-speed rail link between London and the tunnel has fueled fears that the country's creaky transportation system will isolate Britain on the periphery of Europe.
 Sarah Talbot-Williams, a spokeswoman for the Confederation of British Industry, Britain's main employers' group says, "1992 is going to produce a much more competitive market. "If we don't have the infrastructure to get the goods to Europe, we'll continue our status as an island." Long plagued by soaring costs and drilling delays, the tunnel now looks set to open on time in June 1993.
 The high-speed link "will be a benefit for us," he says, "but essential for the country." Some analysts go further, arguing the tunnel indeed needs better rail links if it is to compete with improving ferry and air services. "A high-speed link which covers {only} part of the route proves to be fairly uncompetitive with other transportation modes," says Bill Steinmetz, vice president of transport for consultants Booz-Allen &amp; Hamilton Inc. in London. "If you're going to build high-speed rail, you have to decide how to provide complete links.
