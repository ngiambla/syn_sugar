 LONDON -- A shadow is falling across the light at the British end of the Channel Tunnel.
 Just as prospects brighten for the beleaguered "chunnel," Britain risks failing to take full advantage of the cross-channel link.
 The Thatcher government's announcement yesterday that it wouldn't help fund a high-speed rail link between London and the tunnel has fueled fears that the country's creaky transportation system will isolate Britain on the periphery of Europe.
 The government's refusal to help fund a fast rail service between London and the tunnel terminal at Folkestone culminates an 18-month squabble.
 European Rail Link Ltd., a consortium formed last November to build the rail link, had asked the government to contribute #350 million towards the total #2.6 billion cost of the link.
