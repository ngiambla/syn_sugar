 Folkestone, England -- "We've been fighting the bastards since 1066" was the taxi driver's response to my faint-hearted suggestion that the Channel tunnel, one end of which we were making our way toward, signaled a new epoch in Anglo-French relations.
 Had he read my mind, or just the same edition of the Sun, which that morning had offered the Black Death, Paris streets "ankle deep in dog mess," and a comparatively high suicide rate (in France "suicide relieves the daily grind") among its 10 reasons to hate the French? "Froggy bashing" is nothing new here, though it does seem to have gained momentum.
 In the same week that the French government revealed its plans to spend 190 billion francs ($34 billion) on expanding its high-speed rail network, the prime minister announced that there will be no government subsidy for a fast train between London and the tunnel, in effect shelving plans for a much discussed new 70-mile link between London and Folkestone.
