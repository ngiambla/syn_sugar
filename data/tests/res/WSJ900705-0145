 Folkestone, England -- "We've been fighting the bastards since 1066" was the taxi driver's response to my faint-hearted suggestion that the Channel tunnel, one end of which we were making our way toward, signaled a new epoch in Anglo-French relations.
 Had he read my mind, or just the same edition of the Sun, which that morning had offered the Black Death, Paris streets "ankle deep in dog mess," and a comparatively high suicide rate (in France "suicide relieves the daily grind") among its 10 reasons to hate the French? "Froggy bashing" is nothing new here, though it does seem to have gained momentum.
 But the English objection to the tunnel is not a simple xenophobic reflex.
 The chalk marl under the Channel may be perfectly pliable; the spirit of gloom and resentment about the tunnel (though the disgruntled always are noisier than the positive or the indifferent) may prove more intractable.
 The 1986 treaty, which contains a clause prohibiting government subsidies for the tunnel, gave a 55-year concession to Eurotunnel, an Anglo-French partnership that commissioned Trans Manche Link, a consortium of five English contractors (Costain, Wimpey, Taylor Woodrow, Balfour Beatty and Tarmac) and five French (Boygues, Dumez, Societe Generale d'Entreprise, Societe Auxiliaire d'Entreprises, Spie Batignolles) to design and build the tunnel.
