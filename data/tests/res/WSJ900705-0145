 Folkestone, England -- "We've been fighting the bastards since 1066" was the taxi driver's response to my faint-hearted suggestion that the Channel tunnel, one end of which we were making our way toward, signaled a new epoch in Anglo-French relations.
 The boring machines are fantastic: guided by satellite, gyroscope, computer and laser, these monsters, equipped with Cuisinart-style blades more than 16 feet wide, can chop and shred chalk at about 15 feet an hour, or 650-1,000 feet a week.
 The 1986 treaty, which contains a clause prohibiting government subsidies for the tunnel, gave a 55-year concession to Eurotunnel, an Anglo-French partnership that commissioned Trans Manche Link, a consortium of five English contractors (Costain, Wimpey, Taylor Woodrow, Balfour Beatty and Tarmac) and five French (Boygues, Dumez, Societe Generale d'Entreprise, Societe Auxiliaire d'Entreprises, Spie Batignolles) to design and build the tunnel.
 Nineteen ninety-two may mean an end to duty-free goods, but the tunnel will be more than a symbol of European unity; it will, transport analysts say, reinforce historically dominant trading links in the London-Frankfurt-Milan so-called "Golden Triangle," bolstering northern Europe as an economic entity at a time when its pre-eminence is being challenged by a strengthened Mediterranean "sunbelt," stretching from Barcelona to Trieste, and by new opportunities to the east.
 Thatcher, in her way a choreographer or a sculptor, the monument may be seen in terms of negative space: The tunnel is perhaps her final proof that Britain's Victorian glory can be recaptured without spending a penny of public money.
