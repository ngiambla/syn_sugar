 Lucky punches sometimes win wars, and maybe this was the case.
 We had been allowed into a "safe house" that, according to Interior Minister Agustin Mantilla, had been used as headquarters by the leaders of the Marxist guerrilla movement.
 The police had discovered the house in one of Lima's affluent neighborhoods just two days earlier.
 This was the underground organization's central nervous system, commented investigative Police Chief Fernando Reyes Roca, a short man who is a consummate bureaucratic survivor.
 Interior Ministry spokesman Fernando Yavera joked that this find was going to put Shining Path watchers (such as myself) out of business.
 Alas, as it turned out this was not the rebel organization's headquarters, nor its central nervous system, but more of an archive and memorabilia repository.
 Nevertheless, it was a very important and unexpected police coup against the Shining Path -- one that probably could have brought dramatic results if President Alan Garcia had not decided to make public the operation so soon after the first police intervention, in order to score a quick propaganda gain.
 This impulsiveness gave full warning to the guerrillas' entire clandestine apparatus, allowing them to limit considerably the damage inflicted on them. </LP> <TEXT> As Alberto Fujimori prepares to take over as Peru's next president on July 28, the question of whether the Shining Path will hound his administration as it has the previous two ranks high among his concerns.
 Among Shining Path watchers ("Senderlogos") there is strong disagreement on fundamentals: Is the Shining Path getting stronger or weaker?
 The Shining Path went to war in 1980, on the same day Peru was holding general elections after 12 years of a military dictatorship.
 While President Fernando Belaunde's regime did what it could to maintain democratic legality at first, it was quite unprepared to deal with any insurgency -- especially with one that had been meticulously planned and organized several years before the first shot was fired.
 At first, he tried a liberal approach, looking for a dialogue with the fanatical Shining Path, and sending scores of young professionals to the emergency areas to attack what he said were the "root causes" of the insurgency.
