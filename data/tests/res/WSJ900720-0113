 The police had discovered the house in one of Lima's affluent neighborhoods just two days earlier.
 This was the underground organization's central nervous system, commented investigative Police Chief Fernando Reyes Roca, a short man who is a consummate bureaucratic survivor.
 Interior Ministry spokesman Fernando Yavera joked that this find was going to put Shining Path watchers (such as myself) out of business.
