 LIMA -- On June 4, I was among a group of journalists who were told that the war against the Shining Path ("Sendero Luminoso") guerrillas had almost been won.
 Lucky punches sometimes win wars, and maybe this was the case.
 The police had discovered the house in one of Lima's affluent neighborhoods just two days earlier.
 This was the underground organization's central nervous system, commented investigative Police Chief Fernando Reyes Roca, a short man who is a consummate bureaucratic survivor.
 Interior Ministry spokesman Fernando Yavera joked that this find was going to put Shining Path watchers (such as myself) out of business.
