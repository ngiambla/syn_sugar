 East Coast will intensify, warned a weather researcher who reported a new method for predicting Atlantic tropical storms.
 William Gray, a professor of atmospheric science at Colorado State University and a hurricane forecasting specialist, said he uncovered a strong association between seasonal rainfall in West Africa and the formation of intense hurricanes. </LP> <TEXT> Based on the new findings, Mr.
 Gray predicted earlier this summer that the 1990 tropical storm season would be above average, and so far he seems to be right.
 Gray said his research, published in the current issue of Science, suggests that "intense Caribbean hurricanes Gilbert, Joan and Hugo of 1988 and 1989 may be the forerunners of this change." Comparing year-to-year rainfall levels in the Sahel with the number of high-powered Atlantic hurricanes, Mr.
