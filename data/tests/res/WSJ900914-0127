 In July he said there would be 11 storms severe enough to be named, of which six would be hurricanes.
 The National Hurricane Center said that as of yesterday there have been nine named storms this year, including four hurricanes, a higher rate than normal.
 Weather researchers have been seeking to predict hurricane patterns more accurately as an early warning for coastal residents of the U.S. and the Caribbean.
 A sharp decrease in hurricane activity over the past two decades spurred business and residential development that would be vulnerable to increased hurricane activity.
 Gray said the West African Sahel region is the newest of five indicators he uses to predict global hurricane activity.
 Atlantic hurricanes form from especially strong tropical storms that are triggered by winds and other air disturbances that sweep across Africa.
 Gray said he believes that in the absence of moisture, these storms quickly dissipate, but that the storms gather strength with additional moisture.
 Gray said his research, published in the current issue of Science, suggests that "intense Caribbean hurricanes Gilbert, Joan and Hugo of 1988 and 1989 may be the forerunners of this change." Comparing year-to-year rainfall levels in the Sahel with the number of high-powered Atlantic hurricanes, Mr.
 From 1970 to 1988, the Sahel suffered through a terrible drought, and hurricane activity was unusually low; only one severe hurricane, Gloria in 1985, formed in the area.
 Gray searched back in recent history and found that the Sahel, which includes parts of Senegal, Mauritania, Mali and Gambia, goes through long periods of alternating dry and wet weather.
