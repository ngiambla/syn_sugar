 East Coast Is Forecast, Using Study of African Rain ---- By Michael Waldholz Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal 09/14/90 WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A7A AFRIC ENVIRONMENT (ENV) Hurricane activity off the U.S.
 East Coast will intensify, warned a weather researcher who reported a new method for predicting Atlantic tropical storms.
 William Gray, a professor of atmospheric science at Colorado State University and a hurricane forecasting specialist, said he uncovered a strong association between seasonal rainfall in West Africa and the formation of intense hurricanes.
 Gray predicted earlier this summer that the 1990 tropical storm season would be above average, and so far he seems to be right.
 The National Hurricane Center said that as of yesterday there have been nine named storms this year, including four hurricanes, a higher rate than normal.
 Weather researchers have been seeking to predict hurricane patterns more accurately as an early warning for coastal residents of the U.S. and the Caribbean.
 A sharp decrease in hurricane activity over the past two decades spurred business and residential development that would be vulnerable to increased hurricane activity.
 Gray said the West African Sahel region is the newest of five indicators he uses to predict global hurricane activity.
 Atlantic hurricanes form from especially strong tropical storms that are triggered by winds and other air disturbances that sweep across Africa.
 From 1970 to 1988, the Sahel suffered through a terrible drought, and hurricane activity was unusually low; only one severe hurricane, Gloria in 1985, formed in the area.
