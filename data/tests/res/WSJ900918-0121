 Midwest Rattled by Prediction --- A Scientist Expects a Quake; Some Map Plans to Flee, And Entrepreneurs Profit ---- By Michael J.
 McCarthy Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal 09/18/90 WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A1 MEMPHIS, Tenn. -- Friday nights used to be slow at The Fault Line, a nightclub here on busy Poplar Avenue.
 But after word spread that a major earthquake was forecast for Dec. 3 in the Midwest, The Fault Line began throwing earthquake parties.
 On Friday nights now, hundreds of patrons pour into the club to swig "Earthquake shooters" and sign up to win Dec. 3 Earthquake Escape Packages to the Bahamas or Hot Springs, Ark.
 But even as Memphians whoop it up, the prediction that the Big One may come in December is triggering tremors up and down the Mississippi Valley.
 In Missouri and Arkansas, some schools and businesses have announced plans to close in early December.
 Entrepreneurs are hawking quake insurance, survival kits and gas-line safety gadgets.
 Some people are planning to flee. "You can't run from everything," says Tammy McCormick, a nurse in Blytheville, Ark., who will take her two youngsters and spend several days with relatives in North Carolina. "But it seems stupid to stay on a fault line with a prediction like this." Everybody talks about the San Andreas fault in California.
 And as tons of soil and rock bed pitched and rolled in a seismic frenzy, new waterfalls spiked up, causing part of the mighty Mississippi River to flow backward for several hours.
 That could produce billions of dollars in damage and thousands of casualties. "We're overdue for one in the 6s and low 7s," says David Stewart, an earthquake expert at Southeast Missouri State University.
