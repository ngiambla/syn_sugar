 MEMPHIS, Tenn. -- Friday nights used to be slow at The Fault Line, a nightclub here on busy Poplar Avenue.
 But after word spread that a major earthquake was forecast for Dec. 3 in the Midwest, The Fault Line began throwing earthquake parties.
 On Friday nights now, hundreds of patrons pour into the club to swig "Earthquake shooters" and sign up to win Dec. 3 Earthquake Escape Packages to the Bahamas or Hot Springs, Ark.
 Shaken, thousands of people are crowding into earthquake survival classes.
 That could produce billions of dollars in damage and thousands of casualties. "We're overdue for one in the 6s and low 7s," says David Stewart, an earthquake expert at Southeast Missouri State University.
