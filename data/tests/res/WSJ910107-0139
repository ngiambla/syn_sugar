 One day in 1975, a 49-year-old journalist there complained to a doctor that he couldn't concentrate.
 The plot revolves around a family of brain diseases, probably variations of a single disorder, called spongiform encephalopathy.
 It is infectious, invariably fatal and as insidious as termites, sometimes eating away brain cells for years without detection before a critical mass is spongified.
 Then, over a few months, motor control buckles and cognition crumbles.
 Now, after decades of detective work, medical sleuths appear to be closing in on the molecular culprits behind the disease.
 Their dogged pursuit won't nail a public-health enemy No. 1 -- the disease is rare -- but it may pay off in a big way because the findings could shed light on more common killers, including Alzheimer's disease.
 Spongiform research already has raised questions about a cornerstone of biology and spawned a Nobel Prize.
 The uncanny nature of the disorder sometimes grips scientists with a kind of obsessive fascination, notes NIH researcher D.
 He should know, having chased spongiform leads around the globe for 33 years and won a Nobel Prize in the process.
 Recently the fascination has taken on a more anxious cast as the disease has struck humans and animals with suspicious regularity in several places, underscoring a longstanding question: Do people get the disease from animals?
 The question has burned with special intensity since scrapie, the form of the disease in sheep, jumped to British cattle a few years ago after they were fed ground-up parts of infected sheep.
 About 20,000 British cattle have been destroyed since 1986 in hopes of eradicating the spongiform "mad cow" disease, which makes the animals jittery before they keel over.
 Scientists agree, however, that the disease in animals probably poses little danger to people.
 Scrapie has existed for centuries and "the world is bathed" in its infectious agent, says Dr.
 Yet sheep have never been strongly implicated in cases of the human form of the disease, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, or CJD.
 At least not until the Poltar journalist and two other people died of CJD at about the same time in a rural, sheep-herding part of eastern Czechoslovakia.
 From the first, one clue stood out like a bloodstain: "Almost all of the people are involved in raising and taking care of sheep," she says.
 Against all odds, CJD has struck again and again in the same region, called Slovakia -- 69 times since 1975, mainly grouped in two areas.
 Now villagers there call CJD "our sheep disease." That's a leap of folklore, though, and the sheep link may well turn out to be false, cautions Dr.
 Gajdusek, back at NIH, led studies in the 1960s showing kuru, CJD and scrapie to be essentially the same infectious disease, studies that won the 1976 Nobel Prize for medicine.
