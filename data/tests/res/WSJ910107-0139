 One day in 1975, a 49-year-old journalist there complained to a doctor that he couldn't concentrate.
 The plot revolves around a family of brain diseases, probably variations of a single disorder, called spongiform encephalopathy.
 Now, after decades of detective work, medical sleuths appear to be closing in on the molecular culprits behind the disease.
 He should know, having chased spongiform leads around the globe for 33 years and won a Nobel Prize in the process.
 Recently the fascination has taken on a more anxious cast as the disease has struck humans and animals with suspicious regularity in several places, underscoring a longstanding question: Do people get the disease from animals?
 The question has burned with special intensity since scrapie, the form of the disease in sheep, jumped to British cattle a few years ago after they were fed ground-up parts of infected sheep.
 About 20,000 British cattle have been destroyed since 1986 in hopes of eradicating the spongiform "mad cow" disease, which makes the animals jittery before they keel over.
 Scrapie has existed for centuries and "the world is bathed" in its infectious agent, says Dr.
 Yet sheep have never been strongly implicated in cases of the human form of the disease, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, or CJD.
 At least not until the Poltar journalist and two other people died of CJD at about the same time in a rural, sheep-herding part of eastern Czechoslovakia.
