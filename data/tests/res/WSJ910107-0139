 The uncanny nature of the disorder sometimes grips scientists with a kind of obsessive fascination, notes NIH researcher D.
 He should know, having chased spongiform leads around the globe for 33 years and won a Nobel Prize in the process.
 Scrapie has existed for centuries and "the world is bathed" in its infectious agent, says Dr.
 Yet sheep have never been strongly implicated in cases of the human form of the disease, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, or CJD.
 Mitrova, a researcher at a Bratislava medical institute, heard of the unusual cluster of cases, she decided to investigate.
 Now villagers there call CJD "our sheep disease." That's a leap of folklore, though, and the sheep link may well turn out to be false, cautions Dr.
 Indeed, CJD is a nefarious trickster; the first reported case of the disease, which entered medical texts in the 1920s, really wasn't CJD after all, scientists now believe.
 He had seen that look before in scrapie, the sheep disease, and put in a call to the NIH.
 Brain tissue of infected animals could transmit the disease when injected into different animals' brains, yet microscopes revealed no signs of infectious microbes.
 The cluster of more than a dozen CJD cases "isn't an epidemic" and appears to have topped out in 1989, says Brian Little, an Allentown neuropathologist leading a study of it.
