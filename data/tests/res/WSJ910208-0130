 In response to Michael Gartner's Viewpoint "Tell Me a Good Reason for Handguns" (Jan. 10, op-ed page): Mr.
 Gartner conveniently omits many pertinent facts concerning the use and abuse of guns in America.
 Based on Justice Department victimization surveys, felon surveys, the National Association of Chiefs of Police law-enforcement survey, Promis studies, research by the Rand Corp., and by criminology researchers James D.
 Wright et al. and Gary Kleck: -- More than 99.6% of U.S. handguns will not be involved in criminal activity in any given year. -- More than 90% of police chiefs and sheriffs surveyed agree that criminals are not affected by a ban on any type of firearm, while more than 70% oppose "waiting periods" for the same reason. -- A prisoner survey conducted by James D.
 Wright et al. found that unarmed felons listed tougher penalties for using a gun as an important reason for not arming themselves. -- 75%-80% of U.S. violent crimes are committed by career criminals, many on some form of conditional or early release (30%-35% of career criminals are rearrested with previous criminal charges still pending). -- Gary Kleck found that using a gun for protection from violent crime -- rape, robbery, assault -- reduces the likelihood that the crime will be completed and that intended victims will be injured.
