 TB Cases Increased 38% In New York City in 1990 03/04/91 WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE B6E HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS, MEDICINE, DENTISTRY (HEA) NEW YORK -- The incidence of active tuberculosis cases in the city rose 38% in 1990, to 3,520 cases, according to the health commissioner.
 Myers Jr., said that although the increase causes concern, the city Department of Health is "acting aggressively to halt the epidemic." The health department has a high cure rate in its tuberculosis clinics, with more than 70% successfully completing therapy.
 Myers said that besides special prevention and intervention strategies for high-risk populations, the city is providing $1.3 million for additional efforts.
 The health department said it is providing tuberculosis testing and treatment for the Human Resources Administration's program for the homeless, and will train staff members on tuberculosis prevention and control.
