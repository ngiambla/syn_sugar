 NEW YORK -- The incidence of active tuberculosis cases in the city rose 38% in 1990, to 3,520 cases, according to the health commissioner.
 Myers said that besides special prevention and intervention strategies for high-risk populations, the city is providing $1.3 million for additional efforts.
 The health department said it is providing tuberculosis testing and treatment for the Human Resources Administration's program for the homeless, and will train staff members on tuberculosis prevention and control.
 The department also has an established residence for homeless tuberculosis patients, and is working with substance-abuse treatment services to extend tuberculosis prevention in its programs.
 Those at high risk for contracting TB are people whose capacity for resisting infection is weakened, either through diseases such as HIV infection, by drug or alcohol abuse, serious illness such as cancer, or by poor nutrition.
