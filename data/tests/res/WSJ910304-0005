 A United Airlines Boeing 737-200 jetliner carrying 25 passengers and crew members crashed into a dry lake area near Colorado Springs, Colo., municipal airport, apparently killing all aboard.
 As National Transportation Safety Board investigators hurried to the scene, there weren't any early indications on why the jet might have crashed.
 Although it has always been difficult to measure the effect of crashes on travel, this accident comes just as people were starting to get over fears of terrorism related to the Persian Gulf war.
 The jet, which can hold at least 100 passengers, carried 20 passengers and a crew of two pilots and three flight attendants.
 In July 1988, a United DC-10 crashed in Sioux City, Iowa, after an engine broke apart in flight, killing 112 people.
 In February 1989, the cargo door on United Boeing 747 burst open near Hawaii, tearing a gaping hole in the fuselage.
 About two hours before yesterday's crash, the National Weather Service in Colorado Springs issued its first high wind warning for the area since January, according to James Hall, a meteorological technician observer in Colorado Springs.
 However, he said that wind shear is most dangerous when an aircraft is flying at a very low altitude, either shortly before landing or right after takeoff.
 The last major U.S. wind shear accident occurred in Dallas in 1985, when a Delta Air Lines jet crashed on approach.
 Since then, the FAA and the industry have revamped pilot training on wind shear and have devoted considerable resources to dealing with the hazard.
