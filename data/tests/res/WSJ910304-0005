 Crash of United Jetliner Kills 25 in Colorado ---- By Asra Q.
 Nomani and Laurie McGinley Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal 03/04/91 WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A3 UAL UTX AIRLINES (AIR) FEDERAL GOVERNMENT (FDL) TRANSPORTATION DEPARTMENT (TRN) A United Airlines Boeing 737-200 jetliner carrying 25 passengers and crew members crashed into a dry lake area near Colorado Springs, Colo., municipal airport, apparently killing all aboard.
 As National Transportation Safety Board investigators hurried to the scene, there weren't any early indications on why the jet might have crashed.
 One focus of the inquiry, however, is expected to center on whether there were unstable or gusty winds at the time of the crash.
 The plane hit the ground several miles south of the airport at about 11:40 a.m.
 It's essentially like water hitting rocks and splashing and foaming over." A Federal Aviation Administration official said, "There were some reports of gusting winds but whether or not that had any impact or whether there was any kind of mechanical problem, I can't speculate." Another FAA official said that although it is too early to pinpoint the cause, "wind shear would be a major area of investigation." If preliminary reports that there was wind shear in the area are true, then "that would indicate there was some instability in the atmosphere," he added.
