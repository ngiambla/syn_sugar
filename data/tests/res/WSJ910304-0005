 A United Airlines Boeing 737-200 jetliner carrying 25 passengers and crew members crashed into a dry lake area near Colorado Springs, Colo., municipal airport, apparently killing all aboard.
 One focus of the inquiry, however, is expected to center on whether there were unstable or gusty winds at the time of the crash.
 The plane hit the ground several miles south of the airport at about 11:40 a.m.
 EST yesterday, UAL Corp.'s United Airlines said.
 The crash comes at a particularly sensitive time for the travel industry.
