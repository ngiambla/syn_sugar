 In July 1988, a United DC-10 crashed in Sioux City, Iowa, after an engine broke apart in flight, killing 112 people.
 In February 1989, the cargo door on United Boeing 747 burst open near Hawaii, tearing a gaping hole in the fuselage.
 Since then, the FAA and the industry have revamped pilot training on wind shear and have devoted considerable resources to dealing with the hazard.
