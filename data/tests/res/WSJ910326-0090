 Kelley shouts over the howling gale: "This isn't too bad, you know," he says, though the wind chill factor is about 20 below.

 Kelley -- not to be confused with the other John Kelley, who won the Boston Marathon in 1957 -- isn't the runner he was in 1935 when he won the race, in 2 hours, 32 minutes, 7 seconds.
