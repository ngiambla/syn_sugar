 This Cape Cod country road is deserted, but for the sweaty silhouette of John Kelley.
 Bounding up a hill in his thin green Windbreaker, with sand from the beach blowing into his face, Mr.
 Kelley shouts over the howling gale: "This isn't too bad, you know," he says, though the wind chill factor is about 20 below. </LP> <TEXT> Mr.
 Kelley is in training for the Boston Marathon -- his 60th Boston Marathon.
 And even at the age of 83, he probably will finish ahead of a large number of the 13,000 runners expected to compete -- officially or unofficially -- on April 15.
 Bill Rodgers, a four-time Boston Marathon winner who plans to run again this year, marvels at Mr.
 Kelley: "It's incomprehensible that a man his age is doing what he's doing.
 I'm struggling at the age of 43. . . .
 This isn't golf." Even the thought of running a course of 26 miles and 385 yards leaves some of Mr.
 Kelley's rivals of yesteryear gasping. "Aghast is more like it," says Leslie Pawson, 86, a three-time Boston champion who ran against Mr.
 Kelley half a century ago. "My doctor says: `No running, whatsoever.' I can't even remember when I ran my last marathon." John Adelbert Kelley is a throwback to a time when marathoners did it for glory and cab fare.
 A two-time winner in Boston (1935 and 1945) and runner-up seven times, Mr.
 Kelley is to be the oldest competitor in the race this year -- as he has been for 15 years.
 Kelley is such an institution that Hopkinton, Mass., where the race begins, has made him an honorary citizen. ("That means I don't have to pay taxes there," he jokes.) Two state troopers will run alongside the 5-foot-6, 130-pound Mr.
 Recalls Suni Tomomitsu, one of the runners: "At first we thought, `Oh, wow, he's like Mafia man.' Then we said, `Oh no, this is nice Johnny Kelley.' In Japan, he is awesome." Though he isn't the oldest person ever to enter the Boston Marathon, Mr.
 Kelley -- not to be confused with the other John Kelley, who won the Boston Marathon in 1957 -- isn't the runner he was in 1935 when he won the race, in 2 hours, 32 minutes, 7 seconds.
 He used to start preparing in earnest at the end of January. "In recent years, I've been in training 12 months a year," he says, though the serious stuff -- a daily one-hour run, sprints on the track and long, 2 1/2-hour runs every other week -- begins in December. (He doesn't count the miles he puts in, as many long-distance runners obsessively do, but he says he wouldn't object to an estimate of about 50 miles a week.) Mr.
