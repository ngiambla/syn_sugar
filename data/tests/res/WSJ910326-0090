 EAST DENNIS, Mass. -- It's 5:30 a.m., an icy rain is falling from an indigo sky, and there's a stiff northeaster.
 This Cape Cod country road is deserted, but for the sweaty silhouette of John Kelley.
 Kelley is in training for the Boston Marathon -- his 60th Boston Marathon.
 Kelley half a century ago. "My doctor says: `No running, whatsoever.' I can't even remember when I ran my last marathon." John Adelbert Kelley is a throwback to a time when marathoners did it for glory and cab fare.
 Kelley is to be the oldest competitor in the race this year -- as he has been for 15 years.
