 <DOC> <DOCNO> WSJ910405-0154 </DOCNO> <DOCID> 910405-0154. </DOCID> <HL> Police Chiefs Must Denounce Gates ---- By Joseph D.
 McNamara </HL> <DATE> 04/05/91 </DATE> <SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A14 </SO> <RE> CALIFORNIA (CA) </RE> <LP> The brutal beating of Rodney Glen King by Los Angeles policemen offers convincing evidence that a code of silence exists within that department, but it also illustrates a similar reluctance of the nation's police chiefs to criticize a fellow chief.
 Four officers took turns kicking and beating an unresisting victim for more than two minutes.
 These criminals in uniform would not have dared their brutality had they feared that any of the 17 other police officers watching would report their criminal actions.
 Blatant racist jokes and comments about the beating on the police communications system make it hard to believe that this was an "aberration" as Chief Daryl Gates claims.
 The culture of the department that allowed the brutalizing of Rodney Glen King was created under Mr.
 Gates, who yesterday was put on a 60-day leave by the Los Angeles Police Commission. </LP> <TEXT> A police chief plays an essential role in setting the climate in which his department operates.
 Gates has made public statements clearly at odds with the new concept of community policing, in which officers work with citizens to improve neighborhoods and prevent crime.
 A few years ago Chief Gates referred to gang members as "dirty little cowards," and warned them that "there is resounding applause to every fall of the hammer." The exchange sounded more like one gang challenging another than a police chief seeking to reduce conflict in the community.
 Indeed the Rambo-like challenge did not lower violence, and may have increased it.
 Hundreds of gang homicides occur every year in Los Angeles despite sweeps by the city's police.
 Gates would have been better advised to seek community programs for jobs, education, elimination of prejudice and improvement of neighborhoods.
 Gates vehemently opposed the Police Corps Program backed by other police chiefs.
 The Police Corps would send idealistic young people, including minorities, to serve a three -- or four -- year tour of duty after college graduation in return for federal funding of their educations.
 Gates opposed the Police Corps because its members would not be professionals.
 Yet the presence of such "non-professionals" would discourage the racism and brutality exposed by the Rodney King beating.
 The presence of even one police corps officer witness would have deterred the criminal cops.
 Gates's statement did nothing to lessen the tragedy of the fallen officer, but like his statement about blacks, it gave comfort to bigots within and outside the department.
 And it hardly reduced conflict in a city where the majority of the population is made up of minorities who need and deserve police protection, whether or not they are citizens.
 The unit had advance knowledge that crimes were about to occur, but often stayed outside and let robberies occur, even though innocent retailers and customers were put at risk.
