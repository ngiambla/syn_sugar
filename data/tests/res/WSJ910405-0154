 McNamara 04/05/91 WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A14 CALIFORNIA (CA) The brutal beating of Rodney Glen King by Los Angeles policemen offers convincing evidence that a code of silence exists within that department, but it also illustrates a similar reluctance of the nation's police chiefs to criticize a fellow chief.
 Blatant racist jokes and comments about the beating on the police communications system make it hard to believe that this was an "aberration" as Chief Daryl Gates claims.

 Yet we, his fellow police chiefs, have for years remained silent about Mr.
 Gates, who yesterday was put on a 60-day leave by the Los Angeles Police Commission.
 Gates has made public statements clearly at odds with the new concept of community policing, in which officers work with citizens to improve neighborhoods and prevent crime.
 Gates vehemently opposed the Police Corps Program backed by other police chiefs.
 The Police Corps would send idealistic young people, including minorities, to serve a three -- or four -- year tour of duty after college graduation in return for federal funding of their educations.
 The unit had advance knowledge that crimes were about to occur, but often stayed outside and let robberies occur, even though innocent retailers and customers were put at risk.
