 NEW YORK -- Actress Elizabeth Taylor and the National Enquirer said they reached a settlement of Miss Taylor's lawsuit against the newspaper tabloid.
 The paper said it made "an appropriate monetary payment" to Miss Taylor and apologized to her.
 The lawsuit, which has been pending for nine months, arose out of two articles published by the Enquirer in June 1990 reporting on Miss Taylor's condition and activities at St.
 John's Hospital, Santa Monica, Calif., where she was treated last spring for pneumonia.
 The paper said it published the articles in good faith reliance on information provided to it, but the information was inaccurate.
