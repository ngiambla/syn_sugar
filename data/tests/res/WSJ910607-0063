 You think it would be utter folly to lend money to a Third World nation?
 So, how about a Third World vegetable stand?
 U.S. development organizations are finding that some of the world's poorest entrepreneurs repay their debts at rates approaching 100%.

 The money helps them start or expand their businesses -- selling vegetables, sewing, repairing shoes, making furniture and the like -- and boosts their local economies.
