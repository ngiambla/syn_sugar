 Less than two days after Slovenia and Croatia, two of Yugoslavia's six republics, unilaterally seceded from the nation, the federal government in Belgrade mobilized troops to regain control.
 The Slovenes, about three dozen strong, waved a white sheet from one of the windows, laid down their weapons and were marched down the road.
 On the contrary, the European Community and the U.S. have lobbied heavily for the maintainance of the Yugoslav state, and have threatened to withhold millions of dollars in aid if the country breaks up.
 Secretary of State James Baker appealed to Belgrade to find a way for Croatia and Slovenia to express their "national aspirations" through "negotiations and dialogue" rather than bloodshed.
 Baker and White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater had suggested to reporters Wednesday that the breakaway republics be granted greater autonomy and sovereignty within a united Yugoslavia.
