 Yesterday, under artillery fire from the federal army, they waved a white flag and surrendered as Yugoslavia lurched closer to civil war.
 Less than two days after Slovenia and Croatia, two of Yugoslavia's six republics, unilaterally seceded from the nation, the federal government in Belgrade mobilized troops to regain control.
 They surrounded the airport near Ljubljana, Slovenia's capital, and retook Slovenia's main border crossings with Austria, Italy and Hungary, effectively cutting off international traffic.
 But Slovene Defense Minister Janez Jansa said in a television interview that fighting was going on in at least 20 places in Slovenia, and he estimated there were more than 100 dead and wounded on both sides.
 Slovenes watching the action were horrified, as the consequences of their independence grab became clear. "Yesterday we had a big party, and today we're fighting," moaned Bogataj Vejko, a truck driver from near Ljubljana, who had safely crossed the border early in the morning and was now trying to get back home. "We were hoping it wouldn't come to this." After the shooting stopped, he talked to a group of the federal soldiers, and discovered that some were conscripts from Slovenia. "This is what we have come to," he said. "Slovenes shooting at Slovenes." After the army established control, Milan Jelen, a Slovene businessman, reached into the backseat of his car and retrieved his son's toy slingshot. "Now I'll go at them myself," he joked.
 Then he turned serious, scoffing, "Some independence." Emil Herlec, a leader of the local Slovene mountain rescue team, scrambled up the mountain, through the woods, when he heard the shooting. "The first shots that have been fired in Slovenia since after World War II," he said. "If we want our freedom, we will now have to defend it." In Ljubljana, Milan Kucan, Slovenia's president, vowed in a television address that the republic's militia would respond with "all methods" to any aggression against his "independent state." He called on Slovenes in the federal army to desert and join the republic's militia.
