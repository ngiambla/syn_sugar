 JEZERSKO, Yugoslavia -- On Wednesday, the Slovene soldiers manning this border post raised a new flag to mark Slovenia's independence from Yugoslavia.
 Yesterday, under artillery fire from the federal army, they waved a white flag and surrendered as Yugoslavia lurched closer to civil war.
 Less than two days after Slovenia and Croatia, two of Yugoslavia's six republics, unilaterally seceded from the nation, the federal government in Belgrade mobilized troops to regain control.
 They surrounded the airport near Ljubljana, Slovenia's capital, and retook Slovenia's main border crossings with Austria, Italy and Hungary, effectively cutting off international traffic.
 Slovenes watching the action were horrified, as the consequences of their independence grab became clear. "Yesterday we had a big party, and today we're fighting," moaned Bogataj Vejko, a truck driver from near Ljubljana, who had safely crossed the border early in the morning and was now trying to get back home. "We were hoping it wouldn't come to this." After the shooting stopped, he talked to a group of the federal soldiers, and discovered that some were conscripts from Slovenia. "This is what we have come to," he said. "Slovenes shooting at Slovenes." After the army established control, Milan Jelen, a Slovene businessman, reached into the backseat of his car and retrieved his son's toy slingshot. "Now I'll go at them myself," he joked.
