 Judge Clarence Thomas is about to become a lesson.
 His life's story is a moving one, with its beginnings not in the black bourgeoisie, as Thurgood Marshall's were, but in the hardluck South, his mother a maid, the grandparents who scrimped and saved to put him in school.
 But the lesson that should not be lost is the transcendent one: Clarence Thomas made it in America because he was loved.
 His mother loved him.
 He got love and love gave him pride and pride gave him confidence that he had a place at the table.
