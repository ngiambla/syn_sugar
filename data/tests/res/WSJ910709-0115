 This is rather a burden to put on any man or woman but it is inevitable in his case because he is young, gifted and black and now the center of one great row.
 Some say that he is living proof that in America anything is possible, and that's true, and some note his rise to eminence demonstrates again the progress we have made as a nation in terms of race, and that's true too. </LP> <TEXT> But the lesson that should not be lost is the transcendent one: Clarence Thomas made it in America because he was loved.
 He got love and love gave him pride and pride gave him confidence that he had a place at the table.
 This is something we in the age of the-family-that-is-not-a-family forget: the raw power of love and how it is the one essential element in the creation of functioning and successful people, and how its absence twists the psyche and the heart. (The children of the mother on crack are not consigned to lives of uselessness and pain because AFDC payments are low; they are so consigned because crack has broken the maternal bond that brings with it caring and succor.) Lives like Judge Thomas's remind us of this simple truth. --- It was once thought that to choose a conservative black for a high appointment put liberals in an uncomfortable position, but we will learn in the Thomas hearings that this is no longer so.
