 Clarence Thomas: To Be Young, Gifted and Black ---- By Peggy Noonan 07/09/91 WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A16 LAW AND LEGAL AFFAIRS (LAW) LAW &amp; LEGAL ISSUES, HEARINGS, RULINGS, LEGISLATION (LAW) CONGRESS (CNG) JUSTICE DEPARTMENT (JUS) NORTH AMERICA (NME) UNITED STATES (US) Judge Clarence Thomas is about to become a lesson.
 This is rather a burden to put on any man or woman but it is inevitable in his case because he is young, gifted and black and now the center of one great row.
 And they cared enough to scrape together the money every year to put him in a Catholic school where they hoped the nuns would teach and guide him and they did.
 He got love and love gave him pride and pride gave him confidence that he had a place at the table.
 This is something we in the age of the-family-that-is-not-a-family forget: the raw power of love and how it is the one essential element in the creation of functioning and successful people, and how its absence twists the psyche and the heart. (The children of the mother on crack are not consigned to lives of uselessness and pain because AFDC payments are low; they are so consigned because crack has broken the maternal bond that brings with it caring and succor.) Lives like Judge Thomas's remind us of this simple truth. --- It was once thought that to choose a conservative black for a high appointment put liberals in an uncomfortable position, but we will learn in the Thomas hearings that this is no longer so.
 If Sandra Day O'Connor had thanked the nuns it would have been a skit on "Saturday Night Live" and an issue in her confirmation.) The nuns' affirmative action for Clarence Thomas was the only effective, meaningful kind: the kind we perform for individuals, not because it is state-mandated but because it is right, not because we love a race but because we care for people and love our country.
