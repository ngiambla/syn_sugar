 Almost every country on the continent has its own disenchanted minorities, from the Soviet Baltics to French Corsica, that could be encouraged by the independence declarations of Slovenia and the neighboring republic of Croatia.
 But what Slovenes dream of is one day being admitted to the EC. "It's not size that makes a country successful," says Josip Skoberne, head of the international division of the Slovene Chamber of Economy, citing EC-member Luxembourg, far smaller in population and area than Slovenia. "It's your ability to engage in international trade that makes you viable." Finding new markets in the West is all the more urgent with the certain decline in Slovenia's trade with the rest of Yugoslavia.
