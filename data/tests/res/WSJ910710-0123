 The price of vouchers to obtain foreign exchange jumped 10%, even though Slovene banks had stopped issuing foreign currency. </LP> <TEXT> Yesterday, with a tenuous peace settling over Slovenia, the exchange panicked.
 The foreign exchange rights went begging. "There is a certain logic to this," says Drasko Veselinovic, the exchange's chief executive. "Slovenes are now beginning to see the costs of independence more clearly than when we were at war." The two million people of this picturesque Alpine republic are waking up from their two-week nightmare sobered by the implications of their intoxicating declaration of secession from Yugoslavia on June 25.
 But the West Europeans also are wary of moving toward recognition of the various pieces. "We have every sympathy for small peoples who aspire to affirm their national identity by democratic methods," the Swiss foreign minister reportedly told a European conference on national minorities. "But that doesn't mean we can accept the unilateral alteration of frontiers." This shunning by Western Europe, and the U.S., is particularly disillusioning for a people who enjoy their BMWs, Peugeots and Fiats, their shopping trips to Munich and Venice and their vacation chalets in the Alps.
