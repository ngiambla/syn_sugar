 Almost every country on the continent has its own disenchanted minorities, from the Soviet Baltics to French Corsica, that could be encouraged by the independence declarations of Slovenia and the neighboring republic of Croatia.
 While the European Community is counting on the peace plan it brokered to defuse tensions (it calls for a three-month period of negotiations in Yugoslavia), most governments concede that the country's breakup is inevitable.
 But the West Europeans also are wary of moving toward recognition of the various pieces. "We have every sympathy for small peoples who aspire to affirm their national identity by democratic methods," the Swiss foreign minister reportedly told a European conference on national minorities. "But that doesn't mean we can accept the unilateral alteration of frontiers." This shunning by Western Europe, and the U.S., is particularly disillusioning for a people who enjoy their BMWs, Peugeots and Fiats, their shopping trips to Munich and Venice and their vacation chalets in the Alps.
