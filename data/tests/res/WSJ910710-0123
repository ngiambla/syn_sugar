 LJUBLJANA, Yugoslavia -- As federal army tanks and jets pounded the breakaway republic of Slovenia last week, the pin-striped brokers of the Ljubljana Stock Exchange defied air-raid dangers and gathered in their sixth-floor trading room.
 Bonds issued by the besieged republic traded briskly and climbed to records.
 A full 100% of the corporate stocks -- all two of them -- held steady or rose.
 The price of vouchers to obtain foreign exchange jumped 10%, even though Slovene banks had stopped issuing foreign currency.
 The foreign exchange rights went begging. "There is a certain logic to this," says Drasko Veselinovic, the exchange's chief executive. "Slovenes are now beginning to see the costs of independence more clearly than when we were at war." The two million people of this picturesque Alpine republic are waking up from their two-week nightmare sobered by the implications of their intoxicating declaration of secession from Yugoslavia on June 25.
