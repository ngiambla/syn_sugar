 LOS ANGELES -- A much-awaited report that paints a distressing picture of brutality and racism in the Los Angeles Police Department, and that calls for the resignation of its chief, could prompt changes in law enforcement nationwide.
 The report was issued yesterday by a commission appointed by Mayor Tom Bradley and Police Chief Daryl Gates in the wake of the videotaped beating March 3 of a black motorist, Rodney King, by Los Angeles police.
 Arguelles, vice chairman of the 10-member Independent Commission on the Los Angeles Police Department.
 The harsh tone of the report was welcome vindication for community leaders who have claimed that police brutality is widespread.
 More than 80% of the black, Hispanic and Asian police officers in the force are in the entry-level ranks, the report said.
