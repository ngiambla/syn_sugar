 LOS ANGELES -- A much-awaited report that paints a distressing picture of brutality and racism in the Los Angeles Police Department, and that calls for the resignation of its chief, could prompt changes in law enforcement nationwide.
 The report was issued yesterday by a commission appointed by Mayor Tom Bradley and Police Chief Daryl Gates in the wake of the videotaped beating March 3 of a black motorist, Rodney King, by Los Angeles police.
 The commission, headed by former Deputy Secretary of State Warren Christopher, found that a significant number of officers use excessive force against Los Angeles residents, a problem exacerbated by racism and bias in the department.
