 Crovitz implies, that Hamilton would have approved of limiting terms?
 Federalists Hamilton and James Madison had some experience with term limits.
 In fact, such limits kept Madison out of legislative service at a critical time in the nation's history.
 Hamilton, who did not even support term limitations on the presidency, reasoned that imposing limits "would be a diminution of the inducements to good behavior." Madison said that some members of Congress will "by frequent re-elections, become members of long-standing; will be thoroughly masters of the public business." In fact, that has been the case.
 Over the years, term limits would have unseated Daniel Webster and Henry Clay 10 years before they forged the 1850 Compromise that held the Union together.
