 The mood in the House majority leader's conference room darkened with each passing moment as leading Democratic congressmen heard one of their party's most prominent pollsters report what the public thought about them.
 Hart and a Republican cohort, Douglas Bailey, conducted six focus groups in July in three states -- Illinois, Florida and Massachusetts -- to get a deeper feeling of public opinion.
 Hart summarized their findings, the discussion quickly centered on the dismay and disgust many voters feel about politics and government these days.
 Average citizens, the pollsters found, believe they "simply are not being heard in Washington," and more and more are losing confidence in the electoral system as a means of influencing government.
 But in 1990, voters declared a plague on both parties' houses, underscoring what polls and other focus groups demonstrate: The disaffection with politicians isn't ideological.
 This helps explain the strong momentum for limiting lawmakers' terms, a sentiment fueled by the recent disclosures of the House banking and restaurant fiascos.
 Term limits would accomplish few of their proponents' goals -- more-independentminded and less-beholden lawmakers -- and would result in many unintended consequences-far more power accruing to unelected staff and special-interest lobbyists.
 More important, lawmakers ought to overhaul the disgraceful campaign-finance system to make congressional elections more competitive, and to reduce the role of money and influence peddlers in campaigns.
 A powerful antidote would be to limit committee service, which would have few of the political and constitutional drawbacks of term limits.
 The case is well articulated by two of the most experienced congressional observers: Richard Fenno, a University of Rochester political scientist and author of numerous books on Congress, and Charles Ferris, an attorney who served as chief counsel to both former Senate Majority Leader Mike Mansfield and former House Speaker Thomas P.
