 If Washington state imposes term limits on its congressional delegation Tuesday, the issue of whether or not such limits are constitutional will take center stage.
 Many lawyers and political scientists say no, arguing that neither Congress nor the states may add to the age, citizenship and residency qualifications set forth in the Constitution.
 The court said the "state's strong interests in protecting against an entrenched, dynastic legislative bureaucracy" outweighed objections that term limits restrict voter choice at the ballot box.
