 If Washington state imposes term limits on its congressional delegation Tuesday, the issue of whether or not such limits are constitutional will take center stage.
 They merely prevent a person who has already served a certain number of consecutive terms in office from serving another consecutive term.
 Term limitations do not restrict the right to vote for a candidate because of his or her ideology or party.
 Nor do they limit an incumbent who leaves office for a period of time (six years in Washington state) from running again.
 On this basis, term limits merely ensure a fair election system and the "republican form of government" guaranteed the states under the Constitution.
