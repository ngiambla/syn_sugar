 Mellor 10/31/91 WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A22 POLITICS (PLT) CONGRESS (CNG) NORTH AMERICA (NME) PACIFIC RIM (PRM) UNITED STATES (US) WASHINGTON (WA) If Washington state imposes term limits on its congressional delegation Tuesday, the issue of whether or not such limits are constitutional will take center stage.
 Many lawyers and political scientists say no, arguing that neither Congress nor the states may add to the age, citizenship and residency qualifications set forth in the Constitution.
 But critics of state-imposed term limits on Congress miss the point.
 Term limits do not add another "qualification" for service in Congress.
 They do not prevent anyone from having an opportunity to serve in Congress.
 They merely prevent a person who has already served a certain number of consecutive terms in office from serving another consecutive term.
 State statutes that bar first-time candidates from running for Congress have been held to add to the qualifications set forth in the Constitution and have been invalidated.
 Fiorina struck down a New Mexico law requiring candidates entering a congressional primary to have belonged to their party for a year and to pay a registration fee.
 The constitutionality of such state term limits may, however, be tested next month.
 Florida's attorney general has asked its state Supreme Court for an advisory opinion on a term-limit initiative that would limit the state's members of Congress to eight consecutive years in office.
