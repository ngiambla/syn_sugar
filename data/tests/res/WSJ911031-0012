 If Washington state imposes term limits on its congressional delegation Tuesday, the issue of whether or not such limits are constitutional will take center stage.
 Many lawyers and political scientists say no, arguing that neither Congress nor the states may add to the age, citizenship and residency qualifications set forth in the Constitution.
 But critics of state-imposed term limits on Congress miss the point.
 Term limits do not add another "qualification" for service in Congress.
 They merely prevent a person who has already served a certain number of consecutive terms in office from serving another consecutive term.
