 Many lawyers and political scientists say no, arguing that neither Congress nor the states may add to the age, citizenship and residency qualifications set forth in the Constitution.
 But critics of state-imposed term limits on Congress miss the point.

 They do not prevent anyone from having an opportunity to serve in Congress.
 They merely prevent a person who has already served a certain number of consecutive terms in office from serving another consecutive term. </LP> <TEXT> State statutes that bar first-time candidates from running for Congress have been held to add to the qualifications set forth in the Constitution and have been invalidated.
 Fiorina struck down a New Mexico law requiring candidates entering a congressional primary to have belonged to their party for a year and to pay a registration fee.
