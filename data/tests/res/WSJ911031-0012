 If Washington state imposes term limits on its congressional delegation Tuesday, the issue of whether or not such limits are constitutional will take center stage.
 State statutes that bar first-time candidates from running for Congress have been held to add to the qualifications set forth in the Constitution and have been invalidated.
 Term limitations do not restrict the right to vote for a candidate because of his or her ideology or party.
 Where the incumbent is almost the pre-ordained winner in an election, there is no effective competition of ideas or candidates and incumbents are less responsive to the will of the electorate.
 On this basis, term limits merely ensure a fair election system and the "republican form of government" guaranteed the states under the Constitution.
