 If Washington state imposes term limits on its congressional delegation Tuesday, the issue of whether or not such limits are constitutional will take center stage.
 They merely prevent a person who has already served a certain number of consecutive terms in office from serving another consecutive term.
 They claimed there is a "fundamental right to be a candidate for public office," which they found among the "associational rights" in the First Amendment.
 Term limitations do not restrict the right to vote for a candidate because of his or her ideology or party.
 Therefore, they do not deprive voters of the freedom to associate with candidates based on their viewpoint or with any particular party.
 The Supreme Court has found that clause violated only in those cases where ballot access restrictions discriminate against the poor and against new, small or independent party candidates.
 Nor do they limit an incumbent who leaves office for a period of time (six years in Washington state) from running again.
 Where the incumbent is almost the pre-ordained winner in an election, there is no effective competition of ideas or candidates and incumbents are less responsive to the will of the electorate.
 On this basis, term limits merely ensure a fair election system and the "republican form of government" guaranteed the states under the Constitution.
 States could allow an incumbent who has served a set number of years in the same office to run again, but only as a "write-in" candidate.
