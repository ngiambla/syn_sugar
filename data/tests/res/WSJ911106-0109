Ron Brown, chairman of the Democratic National Committee, says "term limits are a backhanded attempt by Republicans to get rid of Democrats they can't defeat at the polls."

 Certainly the polls show that term limits are overwhelmingly popular with Americans regardless of income, party, race or sex.
 Last month's Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll showed Americans back term limits by 75% to 21% nationwide.
 Martin Plissner, political director for CBS News, says he has "never seen an issue on which there was so little demographic variation." </LP> <TEXT> One reason is that term limits would open up politics to many people now excluded from office by career incumbents.
