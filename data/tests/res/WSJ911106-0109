 House Speaker Tom Foley charges that most of the support for the term limit proposal in Washington state came from "extreme right-wing activists." Ron Brown, chairman of the Democratic National Committee, says "term limits are a backhanded attempt by Republicans to get rid of Democrats they can't defeat at the polls." Are term limits a crusade driven by only one party or ideology?
 Martin Plissner, political director for CBS News, says he has "never seen an issue on which there was so little demographic variation." One reason is that term limits would open up politics to many people now excluded from office by career incumbents.
 Most of the authors of Washington state's term limit are liberal Democrats who want to break up "the old-boy network." One of the authors, Sherry Bockwinkel, says "You won't see white incumbents hanging on to districts that long ago became largely minority." "Incumbency is the glass ceiling of American politics," says Kay Slaughter, the Democratic candidate in a special U.S.
 Shirley Chisholm, who in 1972 was the first black to run for a majorparty presidential nomination, says "longterm incumbency is a big reason that Congress no longer works and isn't representative.
 Today, former California Governor Jerry Brown says advocacy of term limits is a key element in his populist presidential campaign against a "constipated" political system. "Term limits are a castor oil that democracy needs to take," he says.
 Last year, as head of the California Democratic Party he refused to sign a party slate mailer against term limits. "I saw incumbents spend their time fund-raising and worrying about how to stay in office.
 Brown says arguments that legislative staff and the unelected bureaucracy would gain power under term limits are simply proof that "we must curb the excessive power of those political players as well." He notes both groups opposed term limits in his home state; the California initiative included budget cuts that retired more than 700 legislative staffers.
 Other former Democratic governors who favor term limits include Vermont's Madeleine Kunin and Colorado's RichardLamm. "Breaking the gridlock of incumbency could throw the doors open to new people and new ideas that would make politics rewarding, meaningful and fun," says Ms.
 Among those who have, and who will never be accused of being card-carrying Republicans, are: Washington Post columnist Richard Cohen, syndicated columnist Richard Reeves, the National Journal's Neal Peirce and Time magazine's Michael Kramer.
 However, he concludes "it would be a cost worth paying to be rid of the much larger number of time-servers who have learned nothing from longevity in office except cynicism, complacency and a sense of diminished possibility." Columnist Ellen Goodman says "We have to learn once again that ideal public service is, by definition, temporary." She thinks the current Congress proves "the politically privileged class has become more isolated than experienced." Such recent body-blows to Congress as Kitegate and the Clarence Thomas hearings have convinced some liberal media outlets to reevaluate term limits.
