 Martin Plissner, political director for CBS News, says he has "never seen an issue on which there was so little demographic variation." One reason is that term limits would open up politics to many people now excluded from office by career incumbents.
 WCVB-TV, the ABC affiliate in Boston, has often had its liberal editorials called "the Boston Globe of the airwaves." In April, it denounced term limits as "the latest anti-government fad to sweep the country." Last month, the station made a highly unusual about-face and endorsed term limits for Congress: "We're not going to get {leadership} till we have a massive infusion of new blood." Among Democratic Party activists, James Calaway of Texas is typical of those who now favor term limits.
