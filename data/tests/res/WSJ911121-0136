 Gun Control Sprouts From Racist Soil ---- By Roy Innis 11/21/91 WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A14 LAW AND LEGAL AFFAIRS (LAW) LAW &amp; LEGAL ISSUES AND LEGISLATION (LAW) NORTH AMERICA (NME) NEW YORK (NY) UNITED STATES (US) What irony.
 Most black leaders (as distinct from rank-and-file blacks) are supporters, at least in public, of the gun control -- really, prohibition -- movement.
 In Dred Scott Chief Justice Taney, writing for the court's majority, stated that if blacks were "entitled to the privileges and immunities of citizens, . . . {i}t would give persons of the negro race, who were recognized as citizens in any one state of the union, the right . . . to keep and carry arms wherever they went.
 And all of this would be done in the face of the subject race of the same color, both free and slaves, and inevitably producing discontent and insubordination among them, and endangering the peace and safety of the state. . . ." Although much of Justice Taney's overtly racist legal reasoning was repudiated by events that followed -- such as the Civil War and Reconstruction -- the subliminal effects were felt throughout that era.
