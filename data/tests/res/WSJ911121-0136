 Taney, the racist chief justice who wrote the infamous Dred Scott decision of 1857?
 He won his case, but it was reversed in the Missouri Supreme Court.
 Scott was denied freedom. 3.
 The Missouri Compromise was ruled unconstitutional.
 It was during this period that racial paranoia about black men with guns intensified.
