 Most black leaders (as distinct from rank-and-file blacks) are supporters, at least in public, of the gun control -- really, prohibition -- movement.
 Do they realize that America's gun-control movement sprouted from the soil of Roger B.
 Taney, the racist chief justice who wrote the infamous Dred Scott decision of 1857?
 In the early part of the 19th century, Dred Scott, a black slave, had been taken by his owner from Missouri, a slave state, to Illinois, a free state.
 From there he was taken into the Wisconsin territory, free territory above the 36 30' latitude of the Missouri Compromise.
