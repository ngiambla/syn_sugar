 In the early part of the 19th century, Dred Scott, a black slave, had been taken by his owner from Missouri, a slave state, to Illinois, a free state.
 When his owner died in 1846, Scott sued in the state courts of Missouri for his freedom, on the ground that he had lived in free territory.
 Scott appealed to the federal courts, since the person he was actually suing, John Sanford, the executor of the estate that owned Scott, lived in New York.
 In Dred Scott Chief Justice Taney, writing for the court's majority, stated that if blacks were "entitled to the privileges and immunities of citizens, . . . {i}t would give persons of the negro race, who were recognized as citizens in any one state of the union, the right . . . to keep and carry arms wherever they went.
 It was potent enough to cause the infringement on the Second Amendment to the Constitution's "right . . . to keep and bear arms." Under natural law, a freeman's right to obtain and maintain the implements of self-defense has always been sacred.
 It was this change in the status of the black man, from slave to freeman, that caused racist elements in the country (North and South) to agitate for restrictions on guns -- ignoring long established customs and understanding of the Second Amendment.
 With the influx of large numbers of Irish, Italian and Jewish immigrants into the country, gun laws now also targeted whites from the underprivileged classes of immigrants.
 Throughout the history of New York state's Sullivan law, enacted at the start of the 20th century, mainly the rich and powerful have had easy access to licenses to carry handguns.
 Some of the notables who have received that privilege include Eleanor Roosevelt, John Lindsay, Donald Trump, Arthur Sulzberger, Joan Rivers and disk jockey Howard Stern.
 Of the 27,000 handgun carry permits in New York City, fewer than 2% are issued to blacks -- who live and work in high-crime areas and really are in need of protection.
