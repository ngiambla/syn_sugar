 Congress has been dismayingly inconsistent in its voting on gun-control legislation this year, first passing the Brady Bill, then moving in the opposite direction by defeating a provision to ban certain assault weapons and ammunition.
 But in one respect members of Congress are consistent: they demand respect for our "constitutional right to own a gun." They cite the Constitution's Second Amendment and argue it prohibits effective national regulation of the private ownership of guns.
 Virginia's version, later copied by New York and North Carolina, brought together three elements in one article -- affirmation of a right to bear arms, reliance on state militia, and opposition to a standing army: "That the people have a right to keep and bear arms; that a well-regulated militia, composed of the body of the people trained to arms, is the proper, natural, and safe defense of a free state; that standing armies, in times of peace, are dangerous to liberty, and therefore ought to be avoided. . . ." The purpose was to limit the power of the new Congress to establish a standing army, and instead to rely on state militias under command of governors.
