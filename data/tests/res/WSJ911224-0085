 To economists, term limits sound like minimum wages, rent controls and similar interferences with free markets.
 The real surprise is that some strong supporters of free markets, such as The Wall Street Journal, have been the biggest advocates of term limits.
 One argument is that incumbent politicians have unfair advantages in elections because of their ready access to campaign funds, staff, mailing and travel privileges, media publicity, and so on.
 Supporters of free markets and the capitalistic system reject this message because they have faith in the self-interested consumer to discipline the companies that do not deliver the goods.
 Presumably the best solution is to let the market decide, that is, to allow the electorate to determine the proper balance between freshness and experience.
