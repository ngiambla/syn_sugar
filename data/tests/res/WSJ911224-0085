 Much has been made of Alexander Hamilton's reflections on this point in Federalist 72: "One ill effect of the exclusion {from re-election} would be a diminution of the inducements to good behavior." (It is interesting to note, however, that Hamilton was not discussing term limits on the legislature, and was actually arguing against the term limits on the chief executive that are contained now in the 22nd Amendment.) The only respectable argument in favor of term limits that I know of refers to the legislature and involves the interaction with the seniority system.
