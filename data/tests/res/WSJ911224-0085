 Many commentators bemoan the high tendency for incumbents to be re-elected.
 The voters would be better off if they could reach a binding agreement that precluded the re-election of incumbents, that is, if term limits were instituted.
 These arguments parallel the benefits from worker seniority in firms (or, indeed, the usefulness of a parole system as a carrot to help control inmates in prisons).
 The various complexities about legislative term limits and their interaction with seniority do not arise for executive term limits.
 From the standpoint of balance of power, it would surely be preferable to repeal the 22nd Amendment.
