 As an economist, Robert Barro ("A Free Marketeer's Case Against Term Limits" editorial page, Dec. 24) sees no difference between minimum-wage legislation, rent control and other government interventions in the free market, and the intervention of congressional term limitation.
 Barro argues that as one should have confidence in the wisdom of consumers, so one should, when dealing with the electoral process, "have similar confidence in the public." But his dewy-eyed, high-school-civics-text vision of the American electoral process is naive at best.
 Incumbent legislators have carefully crafted a web of perks and privileges that make challenging them a futile crusade, unless they happen to be convicted of child molestation, in which case the race may be closer.
 Soon you start thinking your opinion is more important than it really is and, worse, that perhaps you should codify your opinion on everything under the sun.
 Second, term limits end the adverse pre-selection process that exists whereby most individuals seeking office today actually find the prospect of spending the rest of their lives in Washington, D.C., attractive.
 Today, business people, teachers, computer programmers and other productive citizens look at the prospect of running for Congress and recognize that they must be willing to commit 10 or 15 years of their lives to being politicians if they expect to have any legislative influence.
 With six-year limits in the House (which most term-limit initiatives are now proposing for state congressional delegations), such individuals would recognize that they would immediately be on a par with their colleagues in Congress and that they would not have to give up their productive careers in the private sector in order to serve.
 Seventy-five percent of Americans support term limitation -- everyone from Ralph Nader to Milton Friedman -- because they recognize it as an opportunity for citizens to wrest control of government from an impervious Congress full of check-bouncing, power-lusting professional politicians.
