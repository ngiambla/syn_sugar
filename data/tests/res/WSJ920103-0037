 As an economist, Robert Barro ("A Free Marketeer's Case Against Term Limits" editorial page, Dec. 24) sees no difference between minimum-wage legislation, rent control and other government interventions in the free market, and the intervention of congressional term limitation.
 Barro argues that as one should have confidence in the wisdom of consumers, so one should, when dealing with the electoral process, "have similar confidence in the public." But his dewy-eyed, high-school-civics-text vision of the American electoral process is naive at best.
 Today, business people, teachers, computer programmers and other productive citizens look at the prospect of running for Congress and recognize that they must be willing to commit 10 or 15 years of their lives to being politicians if they expect to have any legislative influence.
