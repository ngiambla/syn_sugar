 There are two solid reasons for congressional term limitation that economists, at least those of the public-choice persuasion, should fully appreciate.
 To have microphones pushed in your face every day and to be asked your opinion on everything under the sun is a corrupting influence.
 Second, term limits end the adverse pre-selection process that exists whereby most individuals seeking office today actually find the prospect of spending the rest of their lives in Washington, D.C., attractive.
 Such individuals are the last ones we should want passing laws governing the rest of us.
 Certainly the composition of Congress under term limitation would reflect something other than 95% men and 46% lawyers, as it does now.
