 As an economist, Robert Barro ("A Free Marketeer's Case Against Term Limits" editorial page, Dec. 24) sees no difference between minimum-wage legislation, rent control and other government interventions in the free market, and the intervention of congressional term limitation.
 Barro argues that as one should have confidence in the wisdom of consumers, so one should, when dealing with the electoral process, "have similar confidence in the public." But his dewy-eyed, high-school-civics-text vision of the American electoral process is naive at best.
 Incumbent legislators have carefully crafted a web of perks and privileges that make challenging them a futile crusade, unless they happen to be convicted of child molestation, in which case the race may be closer.
