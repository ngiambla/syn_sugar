 As an economist, Robert Barro ("A Free Marketeer's Case Against Term Limits" editorial page, Dec. 24) sees no difference between minimum-wage legislation, rent control and other government interventions in the free market, and the intervention of congressional term limitation.
 Barro argues that as one should have confidence in the wisdom of consumers, so one should, when dealing with the electoral process, "have similar confidence in the public." But his dewy-eyed, high-school-civics-text vision of the American electoral process is naive at best.
 To have microphones pushed in your face every day and to be asked your opinion on everything under the sun is a corrupting influence.
 Other than this corruption of common sense, for instance, what could explain Congress's attempt to repeal the laws of economics through federal deposit insurance?
 Second, term limits end the adverse pre-selection process that exists whereby most individuals seeking office today actually find the prospect of spending the rest of their lives in Washington, D.C., attractive.
 Today, business people, teachers, computer programmers and other productive citizens look at the prospect of running for Congress and recognize that they must be willing to commit 10 or 15 years of their lives to being politicians if they expect to have any legislative influence.
 With six-year limits in the House (which most term-limit initiatives are now proposing for state congressional delegations), such individuals would recognize that they would immediately be on a par with their colleagues in Congress and that they would not have to give up their productive careers in the private sector in order to serve.
 Certainly the composition of Congress under term limitation would reflect something other than 95% men and 46% lawyers, as it does now.
