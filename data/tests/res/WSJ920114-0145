 Letters to the Editor: Smile When You Say Gun Control 01/14/92 WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A15 NORTH AMERICA (NME) UNITED STATES (US) In his "Gun Control Is Constitutional" (Counterpoint, op-ed page, Dec. 12), the American Enterprise Institute's Robert A.
 Goldwin's principal concern, it seems, is to deny that the right to keep and bear arms precludes the power to regulate gun ownership and use.
 Even activities protected by the First Amendment may be regulated when they threaten the rights of others.
 Goldwin also writes that "The right to bear arms protected in the Second Amendment has to do directly with `a well-regulated militia'"; thus, arguably, he continues, "if you want to own a gun, sign up with the National Guard." Clearly, this goes well beyond regulating to protect the rights of others.
 This would condition the "right" to keep and bear arms on joining the National Guard.
 The Second Amendment, in its language and its history, makes plain that the need for a well-regulated militia is a sufficient condition for the right to keep and bear arms.
 Goldwin treats it as a necessary condition, which enables him to conclude that Congress could deny an individual the right to own a gun if he did not join the National Guard.
 Thus he says that "In this version, `bearing arms' must mean `to render military service,' or why else would there have to be an exemption for religious reasons?
 The right of the people to serve in the militia." Plainly, any conscientious-objector provision would arise not from a right but from a duty to serve in the militia.
