 I said that although the Second Amendment has nothing to do with private uses of arms, there is an unenumerated but undeniable right to own a gun.
 We have many rights not enumerated in the Constitution, such as the right to marry, drive a car or own a dog.
 In the same way, the right to own a gun is not disparaged by being licensed or otherwise regulated and controlled.
 I likened it to the current law requiring 18-year-old men to register with the Selective Service.
 Registering is very different from enlisting for active service.
