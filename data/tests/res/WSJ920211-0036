 Opponents of any sort of gun control write passionately, but, judging from their letters ("Smile When You Say Gun Control," Jan. 14), they don't read well.
 For example, one letter writer, commenting on my Dec. 12 Counterpoint, "Gun Control Is Constitutional," felt compelled to instruct me that the word militia means "the whole people," a point I quoted three times and also paraphrased once in my brief article.
 He and the others who dwelt on this point also don't read the Second Amendment very well.
 The subject is not just the militia but "a well-regulated militia," people trained, disciplined and armed for defense of the community under commanding officers.
 These rights are not denied just because the Constitution doesn't mention them; and the rights are not disparaged by the fact that we must obtain a marriage license, driver's license or a dog license.
