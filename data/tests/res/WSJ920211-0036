 Opponents of any sort of gun control write passionately, but, judging from their letters ("Smile When You Say Gun Control," Jan. 14), they don't read well.
 For example, one letter writer, commenting on my Dec. 12 Counterpoint, "Gun Control Is Constitutional," felt compelled to instruct me that the word militia means "the whole people," a point I quoted three times and also paraphrased once in my brief article.
 The real issue is that the Second Amendment addressed a serious public concern, to protect the right of citizens to serve as defenders of the community in times of peril, not the personal uses of guns.
