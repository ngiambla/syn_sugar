Abstract: 
In current times, there has been a surge in the
amount of collected data from computational systems. The vast
amount of data can be useful in many applications and elds,
particularly so in Big Data Analytics. However with a large
collection of data there is a difculty discovering important
information. Automatic Document Summarization (ADS) sys-
tems are suitable for the task of outlining useful data. The ADS
system model takes a text document as input, and outputs a
semantically-relevant summary of this information. This infor-
mation can be further separated and outlined as keywords, or
keyphrases. This paper proposes a novel unsupervised approach
for automatic keyword and keyphrase generation system using
Newtons Law of Universal Gravitation. This approach allows
for a complete capture of meaningful text, incorporating the
physical structure of a document and discovered relationships
between highly related words. Our model uses a new weighting
method that combines both the character length of a word, and
frequency of a word within a document to simulate a mass. Our
model then computes the force of attraction and ranks the word-
pair-force as a means of keyword and keyphrase extraction.
Experimental results on several text documents demonstrated
that the proposed approach improves on the state-of-the-art
models.
