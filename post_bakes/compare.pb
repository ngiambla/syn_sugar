~$[MEGA%%dsh%%LITIGATION AND ITS DISCONTENTS 
1%%per%%1 Introduction 
1 This case is an example of what is best described as %%sqt%% mega%%dsh%%litigation %%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[By that expression%%lst%% I mean civil litigation%%lst%% usually involving multiple ]^[ separately represented parties%%lst%% that consumes many months of court time ]^[ generates vast quantities of documentation in paper ]v[ electronic form%%per%%]$~ 
~$[An invariable characteristic of mega%%dsh%%litigation is that it imposes a very large burden%%lst%% ]n[ only on the parties%%lst%% ]b[ on the court system and%%lst%% through that system%%lst%% the community%%per%% 
2 Mega%%dsh%%litigation%%lst%% %%cmp_if%% it proceeds to finality%%lst%% often generates very long judgments%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Regrettably%%lst%% this is a prime example%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The judgment is divided into 21 substantive Chapters%%lst%% of which the first two are introductory%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Chapter 1 addresses features of the present case which exemplify the challenges posed to the courts ]^[ to the parties involved in mega%%dsh%%litigation%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Chapter 2 provides an overview of the principal issues in the litigation ]^[ a summary of the outcome%%per%% 
3 The object of this Chapter is ]n[ to offer comprehensive solutions to the challenges presented by mega%%dsh%%litigation%%lst%% nor is it to put forward the management ]v[ conduct of the present case as a model to be followed in other cases%%per%%]$~ 
~$[On the contrary%%lst%% it is generally only when mega%%dsh%%litigation nears its conclusion that the mistakes ]^[ lost opportunities in the conduct of the proceedings become apparent%%per%%]$~ 
~$[By %%cmp_t%% it is too late%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Nonetheless%%lst%% I think it important to record the dimensions of this case ]^[ to identify some of the challenges it ]^[ similar cases present ]f[ the judicial system%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mega%%dsh%%litigation is an increasing phenomenon ]^[ the courts%%lst%% %%cmp_if%% ]n[ Parliaments%%lst%% must devise ways to deal with it more effectively%%per%% 
4 For the purposes of this Chapter%%lst%% it is enough to observe that the heart of the dispute is the complaint by Seven (as I shall describe the applicants collectively ]v[ individually%%lst%% unless it is necessary to distinguish between them) that in May 2002 it was forced to shut down the business of the second applicant%%lst%% C7 Pty Ltd (%%sqt%% C7 %%sqt%%)%%lst%% a producer ]^[ distributor of sports channels ]f[ Australian pay television platforms%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Seven says that the closure of C7%%sqt%%s business was forced on it %%cmp_b%% some of the Respondents%%lst%% notably the News%%lst%% PBL ]^[ Telstra parties ]^[ associated corporations%%lst%% engaged in anti%%dsh%%competitive conduct during the period 1999 to 2001%%per%% 
(Chapter 3 identifies the various parties ]^[ explains the relationships between them%%per%% 
) 
5 There are many factual ]^[ legal issues in the proceedings ]^[ a number of secondary disputes involving the Optus ]^[ NRL parties%%per%%]$~ 
~$[However%%lst%% the principal questions revolve around allegations that certain of the Respondents made ]v[ gave effect to arrangements that substantially lessened competition in various markets%%lst%% ]v[ misused their market power%%lst%% in contravention of ss 45 ]^[ 46 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) (%%sqt%% TP Act %%sqt%%)%%per%% 
(I refer collectively to the respondents to these proceedings%%lst%% other %%cmp_ta%% those against whom the proceedings were discontinued%%lst%% as the %%sqt%% Respondents %%sqt%%%%per%% 
) 
1%%per%%2 The Hearing 
6 The hearing occupied 120 sitting days%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In addition to Seven%%lst%% six groups of Respondents were separately represented throughout the trial%%lst%% although other parties were also represented at various times%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Seven%%sqt%%s legal team ]f[ the trial%%lst%% apart from additional legal representatives engaged in ancillary proceedings determined by other Judges of the Court%%lst%% comprised three senior counsel ]^[ six junior counsel (although only three ]v[ four counsel were usually in court at any given time)%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Counsel were%%lst%% of course%%lst%% assisted by a significant number of solicitors ]^[ support staff%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The six groups of Respondents actively participating throughout the trial were represented by a total of seven senior counsel ]^[ nine junior counsel%%per%%]$~ 
~$[While ]n[ all of these counsel were present on all hearing days%%lst%% they%%lst%% too%%lst%% were assisted by their respective teams of solicitors ]^[ support staff%%per%% 
7 The burden on the Court was ]n[ limited to the 120 hearing days%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Before Seven commenced the current proceedings%%lst%% it successfully applied ]f[ an order ]f[ preliminary discovery under Federal Court Rules (%%sqt%% FCR %%sqt%%)%%lst%% O 15A%%lst%% against a number of the parties it ultimately joined as Respondents%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The preliminary discovery proceedings involved%%lst%% in all%%lst%% at least seven hearing days ]^[ required four judgments%%lst%% of which two were reserved%%cln%% C7 Pty Ltd v Foxtel Management Pty Ltd [2001] FCA 1864 (Gyles J%%lst%% 21 December 2001)%%scn%% C7 Pty Ltd v Foxtel Management Pty Ltd [2002] FCA 1189 (Gyles J%%lst%% 25 September 2002)%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In addition%%lst%% during the trial%%lst%% other Judges of the Court resolved a number of separate privilege claims that I could ]n[ determine %%cmp_b%% the parties thought it would be inappropriate ]f[ me to see the allegedly privileged documents in advance of the claims being determined%%per%% 
8 The length of a hearing is ]n[ the only indicator of the dimensions of litigation%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Indeed%%lst%% other cases have taken considerably longer %%cmp_ta%% 120 hearing days%%per%%]$~ 
~$[For example%%lst%% a Federal Court case decided in 1985%%lst%% also involving allegations of anti%%dsh%%competitive conduct%%lst%% occupied 173 days of evidence ]^[ 32 days of oral addresses%%cln%% Trade Practices Commission v TNT Management Pty Ltd (1985) 6 FCR 1%%lst%% at 7%%lst%% per Franki J%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Other%%lst%% more recent%%lst%% cases have consumed even more court time%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Thus%%lst%% the hearing in Bell Group Ltd v Westpac Banking Corporation (Supreme Court of Western Australia%%lst%% Owen J)%%lst%% concluded on 22 September 2006 after 404 hearing days spread over 38 months%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In Australian Securities ]^[ Investments Commission v Rich (Supreme Court of New South Wales%%lst%% Austin J)%%lst%% the evidence concluded on 21 September 2006 after 220 hearing days%%lst%% 16,226 pages of transcript ]^[ 67 published judgments%%per%%]$~ 
~$[I refer later to Duke Group Ltd (in liq) v Pilmer (1998) 27 ACSR 1%%lst%% in which the hearing in the Supreme Court of South Australia lasted no less %%cmp_ta%% 471 days ([67])%%per%% 
9 The hearing in the present case was considerably shorter %%cmp_ta%% it might have been%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The parties%%sqt%% estimates prior to the commencement of the trial varied%%lst%% ]b[ in August 2004 Mr Hutley SC (who represented the News parties) suggested that the case was likely to take %%sqt%% a good deal longer %%cmp_ta%% six months %%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Similar estimates were made in February 2005%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In fact%%lst%% the trial took just over twelve months from beginning (12 September 2005) to end (5 October 2006)%%lst%% although that period included a break from mid%%dsh%%December 2005 until early February 2006%%lst%% ]^[ an adjournment of some three months after the conclusion of evidence on 20 June 2006 to enable the parties to prepare their written submissions ]^[ closing oral arguments%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The oral argument commenced on 18 September 2006 ]^[ concluded on 5 October 2006%%per%% 
10 The length of the trial would have been substantially greater ]b[ ]f[ several factors that curtailed the scope of the evidence%%lst%% limited the need ]f[ more extensive oral submissions ]^[ facilitated the handling of vast numbers of documents tendered by the parties%%per%%]$~ 
~$[For example%%lst%% the PBL parties called no lay witnesses%%lst%% despite filing eight witness statements%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Excluding statements from parties against whom the proceedings were discontinued%%lst%% the parties filed 19 lay witness statements which they did ]n[ tender ]^[ which %%cmp_tf%% do ]n[ form part of the evidence%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Obviously%%lst%% %%cmp_if%% all the statements of lay witnesses had been tendered ]^[ their makers cross%%dsh%%examined%%lst%% the trial would have been very much longer%%per%%]$~

~$[Of these witnesses%%lst%% 28 were cross%%dsh%%examined%%lst%% while the makers of the remaining five statements were ]n[ required ]f[ cross%%dsh%%examination%%per%%]$~ 
~$[These rulings relieved the Respondents from the need to call the authors of reports%%lst%% comprising some 111 pages%%lst%% replying to Mr Salter ]^[ Mr Kinsella%%per%%]$~

~$[By reason of these matters%%lst%% a good deal of hearing time was saved%%per%%]$~ 
~$[This is ]n[ to deny that the litigation generated many contests on pleading%%lst%% procedural ]^[ evidentiary issues%%per%%]$~ 
~$[I delivered sixteen reserved judgments on such issues ]^[ made countless ex tempore rulings in the course of the trial%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In addition%%lst%% Graham J delivered seven reserved judgments on questions of privilege ]^[ related matters%%lst%% while Tamberlin J ]^[ Rares J also gave judgments on privilege claims%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Nonetheless%%lst%% the extent of disputation on interlocutory matters during the trial was perhaps somewhat less %%cmp_ta%% might have been expected in hard%%dsh%%fought%%lst%% complex multi%%dsh%%party litigation%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Discussion between the parties ]^[ the bench frequently resolved issues before they developed into contests requiring full argument ]^[ (potentially) the preparation of reserved judgments%%per%%]$~ 
~$[This reduced substantially the number of rulings that I had to make%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The regime required the parties to agree on the application of particular rulings to material that had ]n[ specifically been the subject of argument%%per%%]$~ 
~$[For the most part%%lst%% the regime worked very well%%lst%% saving the Court ]^[ the parties a good deal of hearing time%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The Respondents accepted ]^[ abided by my ruling that the main burden of cross%%dsh%%examining each of Seven%%sqt%%s witnesses ordinarily would be carried by one of the Respondents ]^[ that counsel ]f[ any of the others could cross%%dsh%%examine only %%cmp_if%% there was an issue%%lst%% peculiar to its case%%lst%% requiring additional questions to be put to the witness%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It cannot be said that these arrangements produced cross%%dsh%%examination that was always notable ]f[ its brevity%%per%%]$~

~$[The screens could be viewed by me%%lst%% the legal practitioners ]^[ (except in the case of confidential documents) by members of the public%%per%%

~$[It would have been virtually impossible to conduct the trial without the use of modern technology%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Subject to what is said in section 1%%per%%3%%lst%% these submissions greatly reduced the time that otherwise would have been required ]f[ oral argument%%per%%]$~

1%%per%%3 Extent of the Documentation 
11 While written submissions have their advantages%%lst%% they exact a heavy price%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In this case%%lst%% the volume of closing written submissions filed by the parties was truly astonishing%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Seven produced 1,556 pages of written Closing Submissions in chief ]^[ 812 pages of Reply Submissions (not counting confidential portions of certain chapters ]^[ one electronic attachment containing spreadsheets which apparently runs ]f[ 8,900 ]v[ ]s[ pages)%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The Respondents managed to generate some 2,594 pages of written Closing Submissions between them%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The parties%%sqt%% Closing Submissions were supplemented by ]y[ further outlines%%lst%% notes ]^[ summaries (some of which%%lst%% to be fair%%lst%% were required by me%%lst%% as I shall explain later ([39]%%dsh%%[40])%%per%% 
12 The written submissions are only a minor component of the %%sqt%% paper %%sqt%% burden in a case like this%%per%%]$~ 
~$[A characteristic of mega%%dsh%%litigation is that the warring parties (and often third parties) devote massive resources to locating ]^[ producing vast quantities of documentation that might (or might not) be relevant to the issues in the case%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The wider the issues raised by the pleadings%%lst%% the greater the number of documents that must be located ]^[ produced on discovery ]v[ on subpoena%%per%% 
13 The parties must devote equally massive resources to inspecting the documents that have been produced%%per%%]$~ 
~$[They must also collate ]^[ analyse documents that are helpful (and%%lst%% indeed%%lst%% those that are unhelpful) to their respective contentions%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In the electronic age%%lst%% when deleted emails ]v[ other documents stored in digital form can generally be retrieved%%lst%% albeit sometimes with great difficulty%%lst%% the process of production ]^[ inspection of documents becomes an industry in itself%%per%% 
14 Consider the statistics in the present case%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Seven says that it produced 18,335 documents on discovery%%lst%% either in electronic ]v[ hard copy form%%per%%]$~ 
~$[These consist of 13,702 %%sqt%% unattached%%sqt%% documents ]^[ 4,633 %%sqt%% document groups%%sqt%% %%per%%

~$[A %%sqt%% document group %%sqt%% consists of two ]v[ more documents which have been attached to each other%%lst%% such as a letter with enclosures ]v[ a bundle of board papers behind a cover page%%per%% 
) The comparable figures ]f[ the Telstra parties are said to be 4,519 documents%%lst%% of which 3,251 are unattached ]^[ 1,268 are document groups%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The two Optus respondents provided 3,686 documents (3,002 unattached ]^[ 684 document groups)%%per%%

15 The outcome of the processes of discovery ]^[ production of documents was an electronic database containing 85,653 documents%%lst%% comprising 589,392 pages%%per%%

1%%per%%4 Costs 
17 It is perhaps ]n[ surprising that a case that generates this volume of material also generates very large costs%%per%%]$~ 
~$[What is surprising is the sheer amount of money that has been devoted to a single case%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The evidence does ]n[ quantify the costs incurred thus far by the parties to the proceedings%%per%%]$~ 
~$[However%%lst%% in his oral submissions%%lst%% Mr Meagher SC (for the PBL parties) suggested that Seven has spent in the order of $100 million on this litigation up to date%%per%%]$~ 
~$[This estimate accords more ]v[ less with my own%%per%%]$~ 
~$[If the other parties together have incurred similar expense%%lst%% which I think is likely%%lst%% the litigation has cost the parties collectively a staggering sum%%lst%% amounting to nearly $200 million%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Part of this sum may be deductible ]f[ income tax purposes by the parties incurring the expense%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Thus%%lst%% in effect%%lst%% some of the legal costs will ultimately be borne by the general body of taxpayers%%per%% 
18 When the case was opened%%lst%% Mr Sheahan SC%%lst%% on behalf of Seven%%lst%% suggested that it would be claiming more %%cmp_ta%% $1%%per%%1 billion in damages (including interest)%%per%%]$~ 
~$[By the time final submissions were made%%lst%% Seven%%sqt%%s damages claim%%lst%% at best%%lst%% had been reduced to an amount between $194%%per%%8 million ]^[ $212%%per%%3 million%%per%%]$~ 
~$[This amount was to be %%sqt%% grossed up%%sqt%% by a factor of 1%%per%%429 to account ]f[ income tax%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Pre%%dsh%%judgment interest was also to be added%%per%%]$~ 
~$[But bearing in mind that Seven%%lst%% %%cmp_if%% successful%%lst%% must pay tax on any damages award (as the parties agree)%%lst%% the maximum amount at stake in this litigation is ]n[ likely to be very much more %%cmp_ta%% the total legal costs incurred to date%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It is difficult to understand how the costs incurred by the parties can be said to be proportionate to what is truly at stake (measured in financial terms)%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In my view%%lst%% the expenditure of $200 million (and counting) on a single piece of litigation is ]n[ only extraordinarily wasteful ]b[ borders on the scandalous%%per%% 
1%%per%%5 Challenges 
19 Mega%%dsh%%litigation creates formidable challenges ]f[ any court required to manage the case ]^[ to decide it within a reasonable time frame%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The presiding judge can make efforts %%dsh%%%%dsh%%%%dsh%% perhaps strenuous efforts %%dsh%%%%dsh%%%%dsh%% to confine the scope of the litigation ]^[ thereby limit its cost%%lst%% both to the parties ]^[ to the community%%per%%]$~ 
~$[For example%%lst%% the parties can be encouraged ]v[ even directed to undertake mediation ]v[ other forms of dispute resolution with a view to resolving their differences ]v[ at least narrowing the areas of dispute%%per%%]$~ 
~$[They can also be directed to take measures designed to identify ]^[ record matters ]n[ genuinely in dispute%%per%%]$~ 
~$[But there is a limit to what the judge can do without compromising his ]v[ her role as an independent ]^[ impartial judicial officer%%per%% 
20 In the present case%%lst%% I repeatedly encouraged the parties to enter mediation%%lst%% %%cmp_if%% ]n[ to settle the proceedings%%lst%% %%cmp_t%% at least to narrow the issues%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In fact the parties did undertake mediation on more %%cmp_ta%% one occasion%%lst%% ]b[ apparently with only limited (but by no means negligible) success%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Later in the proceedings%%lst%% I directed the parties to prepare an agreed chronology ]^[ encouraged them to agree on a template ]f[ written submissions%%per%%]$~ 
~$[However%%lst%% the responses illustrate that parties to mega%%dsh%%litigation are often able effectively to ignore (albeit politely) directions made by the court%%lst%% %%cmp_if%% they consider that their forensic interests will be advanced by doing so%%per%% 
21 Much of the cost of conducting mega%%dsh%%litigation is generated by the discovery process%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The process can impose a crippling burden on the parties%%lst%% requiring them to locate ]^[ produce thousands of documents created over many years%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The court may attempt to limit this burden%%lst%% ]f[ example by making orders restricting the scope of discovery to specified categories of documents%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Sometimes it may be appropriate to direct that separate questions be determined in advance of other issues in the proceedings%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Such an approach can reduce the discovery burden and%%lst%% depending on the answers to the separate questions%%lst%% relieve the parties from the need to adduce evidence ]^[ argument on all the issues raised by the pleadings%%per%% 
22 The compilation ]^[ presentation of expert evidence also can generate very great expense%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The present case generated a vast quantity of expert evidence on a variety of topics from a variety of witnesses%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Despite the eminence of a number of the experts in their respective fields%%lst%% a substantial proportion of the costs incurred by the parties in producing this material was wasted%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Some reports were inadmissible%%scn%% some were largely repetitive of other reports (particularly on the competition issues)%%scn%% at least one (that of Professor Williams) I did ]n[ find particularly helpful%%scn%% some expressed opinions on the basis of elaborate factual assumptions that have ]n[ been borne out by the evidence%%scn%% ]^[ some%%lst%% given the conclusions I have reached%%lst%% have turned out to be unnecessary (unless an appellate Court takes a different view of the outcome)%%per%% 
23 In an age where mega%%dsh%%litigation is characterised by heavy%%lst%% often unthinking reliance on expert evidence%%lst%% the court may deem it appropriate to limit the number of reports ]v[ to restrict the volume of expert evidence%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Procedures such as pre%%dsh%%hearing conferences between experts ]^[ the giving of concurrent evidence by experts may reduce the areas of disagreement ]^[ limit the hearing time required ]f[ exploring the remaining differences between the experts%%per%%]$~ 
~$[If the parties insist on tendering expert reports that fail to comply with the rules of evidence ]v[ are simply unhelpful%%lst%% they may find that the tender is rejected%%per%% 
24 Limits may also be imposed on the extent of permissible cross%%dsh%%examination of lay witnesses%%per%%]$~ 
~$[As I have noted%%lst%% I directed that there should be no duplication of cross%%dsh%%examination of Seven%%sqt%%s witnesses by the various Respondents%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Similarly%%lst%% in order to avoid prolonged legal argument ]^[ interruptions to the flow of evidence%%lst%% I ordinarily permitted only one of the separately represented Respondents to object to particular questions asked by Seven%%sqt%%s counsel in cross%%dsh%%examination%%per%%]$~ 
~$[While (perhaps wrongly) I did ]n[ impose rigid time limits on cross%%dsh%%examination%%lst%% I attempted to insist%%lst%% to the maximum extent practicable%%lst%% on adherence to the cross%%dsh%%examiner%%sqt%%s estimate of the time required to complete the questioning of each witness%%per%% 
25 The fundamental difficulty facing a court hearing mega%%dsh%%litigation%%lst%% however%%lst%% is that the parties may decide%%lst%% ]f[ whatever reason%%lst%% to engage in a full%%dsh%%blown forensic battle in which almost every barely arguable issue is examined in depth%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In these circumstances%%lst%% the best efforts of the court to limit the scope of the dispute may amount to very little%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In the present case%%lst%% ]f[ example%%lst%% mediation%%lst%% although apparently helpful in relation to discovery issues%%lst%% did ]n[ allow the parties to resolve the major disputes%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Similarly%%lst%% I made a tentative suggestion%%lst%% which Seven took up%%lst%% that some of the experts might give concurrent evidence as a means of saving hearing time ]^[ encouraging a narrowing of the issues%%per%%]$~ 
~$[However%%lst%% the proposal was strenuously resisted by the Respondents ]^[ ultimately was ]n[ implemented%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The parties%%sqt%% resolute determination to put their respective cases at great length is reflected in the volume of their written submissions%%per%%]$~ 
~$[That determination has also been reflected in the unwillingness of some parties to make concessions unless a point is self%%dsh%%evidently hopeless ]v[ there is a perceived forensic advantage to making the concession%%per%% 
26 A further problem in managing mega%%dsh%%litigation is that the presiding judge often has insufficient advance knowledge of the facts ]^[ issues in the case%%lst%% to impose effective constraints on the parties%%lst%% even %%cmp_if%% he ]v[ she diligently reads the available material%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Knowledge that might have enabled the judge to limit the scope of the litigation often comes too late%%per%%]$~ 
~$[For example%%lst%% with the benefit of hindsight%%lst%% it may have been better in this case ]f[ issues of liability to have been determined separately from ]^[ before any questions of damages ]^[ other relief%%per%%]$~ 
~$[One reason ]f[ expressing this view is that%%lst%% as events have turned out%%lst%% Seven has been unsuccessful in the proceedings%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Accordingly%%lst%% %%cmp_if%% this conclusion is upheld on appeal%%lst%% questions of relief simply will ]n[ arise%%per%% 
27 In any event%%lst%% separate trials on liability ]^[ relief at the very least would have deferred the need to obtain (extremely expensive) experts%%sqt%% reports%%lst%% ]^[ would have provided the experts%%lst%% when they did prepare reports%%lst%% with a firmer factual foundation ]f[ their opinions ]^[ calculations%%per%% 
(I raised the question of separate trials at a directions hearing%%lst%% ]b[ was told that it was an impossible idea in the circumstances of this case%%per%% 
) Similarly%%lst%% substantial costs may have been saved %%cmp_if%% the largely discrete disputes between Seven ]^[ the Optus parties ]^[ between Seven ]^[ the NRL parties had been heard separately%%per%%]$~ 
~$[But I was ]n[ asked to take those steps%%per%% 
28 No doubt courts must endeavour to control mega%%dsh%%litigation more efficiently%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Despite my efforts%%lst%% I cannot claim success in keeping the costs of this litigation commensurate with the value of the claims made by Seven%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Ultimately%%lst%% the only effective constraint may be ]f[ the parties ]^[ their legal advisers to recognise that large%%dsh%%scale litigation is generally a very blunt ]^[ disproportionately expensive means of resolving major commercial disputes%%per%%]$~ 
~$[This may mean that the boards ]^[ shareholders of public companies embroiled in litigation of this kind need to take a more critical ]^[ sustained interest in the proceedings%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Those who are most closely involved in the events which are the subject of the litigation may be the least equipped to make the decisions which determine the course of the litigation%%per%%]$~ 
~$[If there is one lesson to emerge from this case%%lst%% it is that even the largest ]^[ best%%dsh%%resourced corporations owe it to their shareholders%%lst%% %%cmp_if%% ]n[ to the general public%%lst%% to think very carefully before committing themselves irrevocably to mega%%dsh%%litigation%%per%% 
1%%per%%6 Attempts to Refine the Issues 
29 Just as the number of hearing days is ]n[ the only indicator of the dimensions of litigation%%lst%% the length of written submissions may ]n[ be a true reflection of their worth%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Very detailed submissions%%lst%% despite their length%%lst%% can of course be most helpful in clarifying the issues in dispute ]^[ in analysing the complex factual ]^[ legal questions requiring resolution%%per%%]$~ 
~$[But this is ]n[ necessarily so%%per%% 
30 The parties in the present case filed their written submissions (other %%cmp_ta%% Seven%%sqt%%s Reply Submissions) by 15 August 2006%%per%%]$~ 
~$[They plainly reflect a great deal of painstaking work by many people ]^[ the material contained in them has proved to be indispensable in the preparation of this judgment%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Even so%%lst%% it quickly became apparent that%%lst%% subject to limited exceptions%%lst%% the parties had ]n[ structured their Closing Submissions by reference to an agreed list of topics that had been handed up in court towards the conclusion of the evidence%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Seven%%sqt%%s Closing Submissions include an Appendix which rather forlornly identifies chapters in which topics on the agreed list have been addressed ]v[ referred to in some way%%per%%]$~ 
~$[But the submissions do ]n[ follow the agreed list of topics%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The Closing Submissions of the News parties (all 1,006 pages of them) refer to topics on the agreed list%%lst%% ]b[ also do ]n[ adopt the structure suggested by the agreed list%%per%% 
31 For these reasons%%lst%% I wrote to the legal representatives of the parties on 22 August 2006 inviting them to advise me whether the agreed list of topics continued to serve any purpose%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The letter also addressed the question of chronologies%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It acknowledged that the parties%%lst%% in response to a direction requiring them to prepare an agreed chronology%%lst%% had produced two %%sqt%% Proposed Non%%dsh%%Contentious Chronologies %%sqt%% comprising 176 pages%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The letter noted%%lst%% however%%lst%% that the preparation of this document had ]n[ deterred the parties from producing their own competing chronologies%%lst%% comprising many hundreds of pages%%per%%]$~ 
~$[More importantly%%lst%% the relationship%%lst%% %%cmp_if%% any%%lst%% between the various chronologies had been left unclear%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The letter inquired how I was to determine which of the many events ]^[ transactions referred to in the various chronologies were genuinely in dispute%%per%% 
32 The written responses of the parties to my enquiries made it clear that%%lst%% by ]^[ large%%lst%% they had decided to ignore the %%sqt%% agreed %%sqt%% list of topics%%per%%]$~ 
~$[They had taken this course notwithstanding my understanding%%lst%% derived from discussions in court%%lst%% that the list would provide a template ]f[ the written submissions and%%lst%% in all probability%%lst%% ]f[ the judgment%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In consequence%%lst%% it appeared to me that the agreed list of topics no longer served any useful purpose%%per%% 
33 It became equally clear that the direction to the parties to prepare an agreed chronology had served little purpose%%per%%]$~ 
~$[I was unable to determine which facts were in dispute%%lst%% at least without working my way through many hundreds of pages of material%%lst%% most of which was ]n[ cross%%dsh%%referenced to the competing chronologies%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Nor could I ascertain readily which factual issues were thought by the parties to be critical to the resolution of the many claims made by Seven%%per%% 
34 In a second letter to the parties%%lst%% dated 29 August 2006%%lst%% I expressed myself thus%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%Despite their elaborate detail%%lst%% some of the submissions seem to me to pay insufficient attention to the need to assist the Court in its difficult task of ordering a vast mass of material%%lst%% isolating the issues ]^[ resolving them%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The responses to my letter suggest that this state of affairs has come about %%cmp_b%% the parties%%lst%% generally speaking%%lst%% have decided to follow their own paths rather %%cmp_ta%% accommodate the approach suggested (and in certain respects directed) by the Court%%per%%]$~ 
~$[That approach was designed to expose as clearly as possible the legal ]^[ factual issues in dispute ]^[ thus make the resolution of them more manageable%%per%%]$~ 
~$[As I have repeatedly warned%%lst%% the task of writing a judgment in this matter may turn out to be unmanageable %%cmp_if%% the parties do ]n[ co%%dsh%%operate in the presentation of arguments ]^[ submissions%%lst%% particularly in relation to disputed factual issues%%per%%]$~ 
~$[One consequence of imposing an unrealistic burden on the Judge is that completion of the judgment will be delayed to a point which is unsatisfactory both ]f[ the Court ]^[ ]f[ the parties%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Another is that the conduct of any appeal will be rendered even more complex%%lst%% time consuming ]^[ logistically difficult %%cmp_ta%% can be expected in a case of these dimensions%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Quite apart from their length%%lst%% I must confess to being surprised about some aspects of the submissions%%per%%]$~ 
~$[At the risk of stating the obvious%%lst%% part of the art of advocacy is to make it easy ]f[ the decision%%dsh%%maker to understand what issues need to be resolved ]^[ to explain clearly%%lst%% cogently ]^[ concisely how ]^[ why the crucial issues should be resolved in favour of a particular party%%per%%]$~ 
~$[To leave the Judge%%lst%% %%cmp_if%% ]n[ completely at large%%lst%% %%cmp_t%% without a reliable working compass in a vast sea of factual material%%lst%% is ]n[ a technique calculated to advance a party%%sqt%%s case%%per%%]$~ 
~$[This%%lst%% I hasten to say%%lst%% is ]n[ %%cmp_b%% any Judge would consciously penalise a party by reason of the bulk of its submissions ]v[ the manner in which its arguments are presented%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It is %%cmp_b%% the cogency ]^[ persuasiveness of submissions depends on the ability of the Judge to follow them ]^[ to isolate the critical legal ]^[ factual issues upon which a case is likely to turn%%sqt%%%%per%% 
35 In this letter%%lst%% I foreshadowed%%lst%% among other things%%lst%% making a direction that each party provide a summary of its case which identified%%cln%%

~$[This recorded my dissatisfaction with certain aspects of the Closing Submissions%%lst%% although I acknowledged that%%lst%% at that stage I had ]n[ had time to read all of them%%per%%]$~ 
~$[I identified a particular problem with Seven%%sqt%%s Closing Submissions%%lst%% as follows%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%Apart from the matters I have already identified in the correspondence%%lst%% I am afraid that I am having considerable difficulty in following the case (or%%lst%% more accurately%%lst%% the very many cases) that the applicants apparently wish to put%%per%%]$~ 
~$[This difficulty arises notwithstanding indeed perhaps %%cmp_b%% of %%dsh%%%%dsh%%%%dsh%% the length of the written submissions (over 1,500 pages)%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The submissions appear to demonstrate a marked reluctance to refine the issues being presented to the Court ]f[ determination%%per%%]$~ 
~$[They put forward what seems to me at the moment to be a bewildering range of alternatives ]^[ provide little guidance as to how the possible combinations ]^[ permutations should be addressed in a judgment%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Indeed%%lst%% the applicants seem to be reluctant to identify their primary contentions from an extraordinary number of alternative arguments%%sqt%%%%per%% 
37 I pointed out that Seven%%sqt%%s Closing Submissions appeared to advance close to 100 alternative contentions in support of its claim to relief based on alleged contraventions of s 45(2) of the TP Act %%per%% 
(The s 45(2) claim is ]b[ one of many causes of action pleaded by Seven in these proceedings%%per%% 
) Furthermore%%lst%% the Closing Submissions had failed to identify Seven%%sqt%%s primary case under s 45(2)%%cln%%

~$[Which causes of action can be ignored%%qsn%%]$~ 
~$[Surely ]n[ all are seriously pressed%%sqt%%%%per%% 
38 The problems I encountered with some of the Closing Submissions prompted me to conduct what in effect was a pre%%dsh%%oral submissions directions hearing%%per%%]$~ 
~$[At that hearing%%lst%% on 4 September 2006%%lst%% Mr Sheahan provided a draft %%sqt%% Case Summary %%sqt%% on behalf of Seven that addressed some of the concerns I had raised in the correspondence%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The Respondents indicated that they%%lst%% too%%lst%% were willing to prepare Case Summaries to assist me to understand the issues in the proceeding%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Not surprisingly%%lst%% most of the parties suggested that the Case Summaries would need to be somewhat longer %%cmp_ta%% the very short documents I had envisaged%%per%%

~$[Seven%%sqt%%s Case Summary%%lst%% comprising 54 pages%%lst%% ]f[ the first time identifies its primary case under s 45(2) of the TP Act ]^[ attempts to explain the relationship between at least some of the many causes of action upon which it relies%%per%%]$~

~$[Indeed%%lst%% Mr Sumption did ]n[ shrink from introducing new ]v[ reformulated arguments in his oral submissions in reply%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Naturally%%lst%% the introduction of fresh arguments at this stage prompted the Respondents to reply in their own oral submissions ]^[ to hand up ]y[ further written submissions%%per%% 
41 It is difficult to avoid the impression that the changes in Seven%%sqt%%s position ]^[ its frequent claims that the Respondents had misunderstood its arguments were ]n[ entirely unrelated to the fact that Seven%%sqt%%s most senior counsel was present ]f[ only about 30 of the 120 days of the trial%%per%%]$~ 
~$[No matter how experienced ]^[ skilled counsel may be %%dsh%%%%dsh%%%%dsh%% ]^[ in this case the parties%%lst%% including Seven%%lst%% were represented by very experienced ]^[ very skilled counsel %%dsh%%%%dsh%%%%dsh%% continuity of presentation in a lengthy ]^[ complex case is hard to achieve without continuity of representation%%per%% 
1%%per%%7 Chronologies 
42 I have referred to the absence of a comprehensive agreed chronology%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The difficulties created by the lack of such a document have been ameliorated to some extent by the individual chronologies%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In particular%%lst%% News has provided an extremely detailed chronology%%lst%% albeit (as one would expect) an account that is%%lst%% to a degree%%lst%% selective ]^[ incomplete on some issues%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Nonetheless%%lst%% when read with Seven%%sqt%%s chronologies ]^[ supplemented by other material%%lst%% it has provided an extremely useful resource ]f[ the preparation of the chronologies incorporated into this judgment%%per%% 
43 I do ]n[ wish to underestimate the difficulties facing the parties in managing ]^[ presenting a case such as this%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Nor do I wish to discount the very considerable assistance I have received from all parties%%lst%% including Seven%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Nonetheless%%lst%% it is appropriate to record that Seven%%sqt%%s chronologies have been of less assistance %%cmp_ta%% I might have expected%%per%%]$~ 
~$[They are comparatively sketchy ]^[ do ]n[ incorporate%%lst%% even by cross%%dsh%%referencing%%lst%% much material that (as the written submissions make plain) is important to Seven%%sqt%%s case%%per%% 
44 In order to incorporate material of this kind into the factual account (Chapters 6 to 11)%%lst%% it has been necessary to scour Seven%%sqt%%s written submissions to locate references to events%%lst%% transactions ]^[ communications that Seven regards as important to its case%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Since the material is ]n[ presented in chronological order%%lst%% the task of compiling ]^[ presenting the facts has been rendered more difficult ]^[ time%%dsh%%consuming %%cmp_ta%% it should have been%%per%% 
45 News%%sqt%% chronology does ]n[ address the events leading to ]^[ consequential upon what have been described as the First ]^[ Second Variation Agreements%%lst%% entered into between C7 ]^[ Optus in late 2001%%per%%]$~ 
~$[This is %%cmp_b%% those events have given rise only to claims between Seven ]^[ Optus%%lst%% ]^[ do ]n[ involve News%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Neither Seven nor Optus has prepared a comprehensive chronology of the events relevant to these claims%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Instead they have preferred to incorporate references to transactions%%lst%% documents ]^[ conversations within the interstices of their extensive written submissions%%per%%]$~ 
~$[I have %%cmp_tf%% had to prepare my own chronology by identifying the apparently significant events (which sometimes turn out to be insignificant) from the submissions ]^[ placing them in some kind of order%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The advantages to the parties%%lst%% let alone to the Court%%lst%% of imposing this additional burden are ]n[ apparent%%per%% 
1%%per%%8 Preparing a Judgment 
46 Writing a judgment in a case such as this is an extremely onerous task%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In part%%lst%% this is due to the sheer volume of material that must be read%%lst%% absorbed ]^[ analysed%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The onerous nature of the task increases in proportion to the complexity of the legal ]^[ factual issues requiring resolution%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In my view%%lst%% only those who have undertaken a task of this character ]^[ magnitude can appreciate how relentless ]^[ indeed stressful it can be%%per%% 
47 The volume of material is%%lst%% however%%lst%% only part of the story%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Even though the judge has heard the entirety of the evidence ]^[ had the benefit of written ]^[ oral submissions%%lst%% it is only by working through the mass of material in painstaking detail that the full picture (or at least as full a picture as the judge can reasonably discern) emerges%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Sometimes this requires the analysis of apparently discrete issues to be re%%dsh%%evaluated as additional material%%lst%% perhaps referred to in another context%%lst%% comes to light%%per%% 
48 For these reasons%%lst%% mega%%dsh%%litigation requires the judge to be given every assistance that modern information technology can provide%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The writing of this judgment would ]n[ have been possible without the electronic databases prepared ]f[ the trial ]^[ the search functions they incorporate%%per%%]$~ 
~$[I have found particularly useful the electronic versions of the parties%%sqt%% written submissions which%%lst%% at my request%%lst%% incorporated hyperlinks to the main documents (pleadings%%lst%% statements%%lst%% exhibits ]^[ transcript) to which the submissions refer%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Similarly%%lst%% the electronic version of the transcript%%lst%% with hyperlinks to documents recorded in the transcript by Doc ID number%%lst%% has been an invaluable resource%%per%% 
49 Even so%%lst%% there have been many problems associated with the use of the databases that%%lst%% with the benefit of hindsight%%lst%% could have been avoided%%per%%]$~ 
~$[An example is interruptions to access apparently created by the interface between the database established ]f[ the hearing ]^[ the Court%%sqt%%s security system%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Another is the inconsistencies in the formatting of material%%lst%% including submissions%%lst%% provided by the parties%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It is ]n[ necessary to record all the problems here%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The important point is that%%lst%% in future%%lst%% the setting up ]^[ co%%dsh%%ordination of electronic databases in mega%%dsh%%litigation must be carried out under the direct supervision of the Court%%lst%% ]n[ the parties%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Moreover%%lst%% the process must be directed from the outset to meeting the judgment writing needs of the judge%%per%% 
50 In saying this%%lst%% I do ]n[ attribute any responsibility to the parties ]f[ the information technology problems I have encountered%%per%%]$~ 
~$[I wish to make it clear that the legal representatives have unfailingly responded helpfully to my requests ]f[ information ]^[ ]f[ modifications to be made to the databases%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The responsibility is that of the Court%%per%% 
1%%per%%9 Scope of the Judgment 
1%%per%%9%%per%%1 Unresolved Issues 
51 One consequence of Seven%%sqt%%s reluctance to narrow its case%%lst%% ]v[ to limit the range of alternative claims%%lst%% is that I have been faced with a large number of possible combinations ]^[ permutations%%lst%% depending on the findings of fact ]^[ the conclusions of law I reach%%per%%]$~ 
~$[There is nothing unusual about a case that presents multiple issues ]^[ in which the parties rely on alternative arguments%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In such a case%%lst%% in order to accommodate the possibility of an appeal%%lst%% a trial judge will often consider it appropriate to make findings on issues that do ]n[ strictly arise in view of his ]v[ her decision%%per%%]$~ 
~$[This approach may allow the appellate court%%lst%% %%cmp_if%% it takes a different view on a question of law ]v[ on a particular finding of fact%%lst%% to make orders finally resolving the proceedings without further fact finding%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The inconvenience of remitting the matter to enable further findings of fact to be made is thereby avoided%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In particular%%lst%% where an applicant fails on liability it is often a sensible course ]f[ the trial judge to assess damages ]v[ determine other questions of relief in the event that an appeal on the issue of liability is upheld%%per%% 
52 An example of the approach I have described is Australian Competition ]^[ Consumer Commission v Visy Paper Pty Ltd (2000) 186 ALR 731%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In that case%%lst%% I dismissed the claim by the Australian Competition ]^[ Consumer Commission (%%sqt%% ACCC %%sqt%%) ]f[ pecuniary penalties%%lst%% %%cmp_b%% I construed s 45(6) of the TP Act in a manner that removed the alleged conduct from the prohibition on exclusive dealing contained in s 45(2)(a)(i)%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Since I recognised that the matter was likely to go on appeal%%lst%% I made the factual findings that would be required %%cmp_if%% a different construction of s 45(6) were to be adopted%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In the event%%lst%% both the Full Court ]^[ the High Court did take a different view of s 45(6)%%per%%]$~ 
~$[As I had made the necessary findings%%lst%% there was no occasion to remit the proceedings (except to determine the appropriate penalties)%%cln%% Australian Competition ]^[ Consumer Commission v Visy Paper Pty Ltd [2001] FCA 1075 %%scn%% (2001) 112 FCR 37%%scn%% Visy Paper Pty Ltd v Australian Competition ]^[ Consumer Commission [2003] HCA 59 %%scn%% (2003) 216 CLR 1%%per%%]$~ 
~$[I attempted to take a similar approach in Jango v Northern Territory [2006] FCA 318 %%scn%% (2006) 152 FCR 150%%per%% 
53 Subject to my observations at the conclusion of this Chapter%%lst%% an appeal in the present case%%lst%% given the damages claimed (and the costs of the proceedings)%%lst%% is inevitable%%per%%]$~ 
~$[However%%lst%% it is simply ]n[ possible to make findings on every factual issue that might require resolution %%cmp_if%% an appellate court takes a different view of the many questions of law or%%lst%% indeed%%lst%% of fact that are determined in this judgment%%per%%]$~ 
~$[I have been able to identify ]^[ address certain issues upon which I consider that I should express a view%%lst%% even though they do ]n[ arise on the findings I have made%%per%%]$~ 
~$[But it is clearly ]n[ feasible to canvass all the questions that might arise in the event of a successful appeal%%per%% 
54 The conclusion I have reached is that Seven has ]n[ succeeded in any of the many causes of action in which it has relied%%per%%]$~ 
~$[I have ]n[ addressed in this judgment the question of any relief to which Seven might be entitled%%lst%% should I be wrong in rejecting its case%%per%%]$~ 
~$[My principal reason ]f[ ]n[ assessing damages%%lst%% ]v[ dealing with any other claims ]f[ relief%%lst%% is that I simply do ]n[ know on what provisional basis the question should be addressed%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Judging from the way the case has been conducted thus far%%lst%% Seven is likely to appeal on a very large number of grounds%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The relief to which Seven will be entitled%%lst%% should it succeed on appeal%%lst%% will depend upon which grounds are upheld%%per%%]$~ 
~$[To attempt to cover all possibilities would take an utterly disproportionate amount of further time ]^[ effort%%per%% 
55 I have explained on several occasions to the parties that in the event of a successful appeal they run the risk of the proceedings having to be remitted in order to enable further necessary findings of fact to be made ]v[ to deal with other unresolved issues%%per%%]$~ 
~$[I gave these explanations in order to bring home to the parties the virtues of compromise in the litigation ]^[ to emphasise the fact that this round of litigation (even allowing ]f[ an appeal) may well ]n[ be the last%%per%%]$~ 
~$[They have chosen to press ahead in full knowledge of the possible consequences%%lst%% including the fact that I may ]n[ be available to hear any remitted proceedings%%per%% 
56 Despite the warnings I have given to the parties%%lst%% I propose to give them the opportunity to make brief submissions as to whether%%lst%% in order to minimise the inconvenience that might otherwise flow from a successful appeal%%lst%% I should assess damages on the basis of a particular hypothesis%%per%%]$~ 
~$[As at present advised%%lst%% I am ]n[ prepared to canvass all the alternatives advanced by Seven at the trial%%per%%]$~ 
~$[However%%lst%% %%cmp_if%% there is one particular hypothesis that can be identified on the basis of which findings by me in relation to relief are likely to prove helpful%%lst%% I would consider preparing a supplementary judgment%%per%% 
1%%per%%9%%per%%2 Length of the Judgment 
57 A related problem is created by the enormous volume of material with which I have been presented%%per%%]$~ 
~$[If I were to deal with every argument in detail%%lst%% ]n[ only would the judgment be even longer %%cmp_ta%% it is now%%lst%% ]b[ it would involve completely unacceptable delays in finalising the judgment%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Faced with a similar problem in TPC v TNT Management%%lst%% Franki J observed (6 FCR%%lst%% at 8) that it was necessary to deal with the evidence ]^[ submissions %%sqt%% in a practical way %%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[This meant%%lst%% among other things%%lst%% ]n[ referring to evidence %%cmp_if%% it was of minor significance ]^[ ]n[ recounting unimportant submissions%%per%% 
58 In Western Australia v Ward [2000] FCA 191 %%scn%% (2000) 99 FCR 316%%lst%% an appeal involving many complex questions%%lst%% Beaumont ]^[ von Doussa JJ made these comments (at 337 [54])%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%At trial more %%cmp_ta%% 9,000 pages of transcript were recorded%%lst%% ]^[ the exhibits run into many thousands of pages%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Written submissions on the appeal also run into thousands of pages%%per%% 
%%per%%%%per%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In complex appeals involving enormous quantities of material it is impracticable%%lst%% in reasons ]f[ judgment%%lst%% to explore at length every one of the complaints made by each appellant%%per%%]$~ 
~$[We propose %%cmp_tf%% to %%per%%%%per%%%%per%% confine our reasons to the issues raised that are both significant ]^[ consequential%%sqt%%%%per%% 
59 Beaumont ]^[ von Doussa JJ made their comments in an appellate judgment%%lst%% ]n[ a judgment delivered after a trial%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Nonetheless%%lst%% their observations ]^[ those of Franki J in TPC v TNT Management are pertinent to the present case%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In making findings of fact%%lst%% I have endeavoured to take into account the material identified in the written ]^[ oral submissions that is relevant to the findings%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Similarly%%lst%% I have endeavoured to address the principal arguments advanced by the parties (bearing in mind that it is ]n[ practicable to resolve all the alternative contentions that do ]n[ arise on the conclusions I have reached)%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Nonetheless%%lst%% it is neither possible nor desirable to canvass explicitly all the arguments referred to in the submissions ]v[ the entirety of the evidence that may have influenced my findings%%per%% 
60 I am conscious that this is a very long judgment indeed%%per%%]$~ 
~$[I have endeavoured to bear in mind the advice of Schiemann LJ in Customs ]^[ Excise Commissioners v A [2002] EWCA Civ 1039 %%scn%% [2003] 2 All ER 736%%lst%% at 754 [83]%%lst%% endorsed by the New South Wales Court of Appeal in Digi%%dsh%%Tech (Australia) Ltd v Brand (2004) 62 IPR 184%%lst%% at 228%%dsh%%229 [285]%%dsh%%[286]%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%judges should bear in mind that the primary function of a first instance judgment is to find facts ]^[ identify the crucial legal points ]^[ to advance reasons ]f[ deciding them in a particular way%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The longer a judgment is ]^[ the more issues with which it deals the greater the likelihood that%%cln%% (i) the losing party%%lst%% the Court of Appeal ]^[ any future readers of the judgment will ]n[ be able to identify the crucial matters which swayed the judge%%scn%% (ii) the judgment will contain something with which the unsuccessful party can legitimately take issue ]^[ attempt to launch an appeal%%scn%% (iii) citation of the judgment in future cases will leng%%cmp_t%% the hearing of those future cases %%cmp_b%% time will be taken sorting out the precise status of the judicial observation in question%%scn%% ]^[ (iv) reading the judgment will occupy a considerable amount of the time of legal advisers to other parties in future cases who again will have to sort out the status of the judicial observation in question%%per%%]$~ 
~$[All this adds to the cost of obtaining legal advice%%sqt%%%%per%% 
61 I have also endeavoured to heed the warning of the Court of Appeal (at [282]) that %%sqt%% prolixity is an enemy of comprehensibility and%%lst%% indeed%%lst%% cogency %%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[As was said by Gleeson CJ%%lst%% McHugh ]^[ Gummow JJ in Whisprun Pty Ltd v Dixon [2003] HCA 48 %%scn%% (2003) 200 ALR 447%%lst%% at 464 [62]%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%A judge%%sqt%%s reasons are ]n[ required to mention every fact ]v[ argument relied on by the losing party as relevant to an issue%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Judgments of trial judges would soon become longer %%cmp_ta%% they already are %%cmp_if%% a judge%%sqt%%s failure to mention such facts ]^[ arguments would be evidence that he ]v[ she had ]n[ properly considered the losing party%%sqt%%s case%%sqt%%%%per%% 
62 Despite my efforts%%lst%% I readily accept that I cannot validly make Mozart%%sqt%%s protest to the Emperor (as imagined by Peter Shaffer in %%sqt%% Amadeus %%sqt%%)%%lst%% in response to the Emperor%%sqt%%s complaint that Mozart%%sqt%%s new symphony contained too many notes%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%I don%%sqt%%t understand%%per%%]$~ 
~$[There are just as many notes%%lst%% Majesty%%lst%% as are required%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Neither more nor less%%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[No doubt%%lst%% %%cmp_if%% I devoted ]y[ more time to the preparation of this judgment%%lst%% the number of words (if ]n[ notes) might have been reduced sufficiently to escape legitimate criticism%%per%%]$~ 
~$[I plead in mitigation that the concept of proportionality applies as much to the time required to write a judgment as it does to other aspects of litigation%%per%% 
1%%per%%10 A Risk 
63 There is a particular risk associated with mega%%dsh%%litigation that (happily ]f[ all concerned%%lst%% ]b[ particularly ]f[ me) has ]n[ (yet) eventuated in these proceedings%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The completion of the trial ]^[ the timely preparation of a judgment are contingent upon the trial judge surviving in reasonable health ]f[ the entirety of the proceedings%%per%% 
64 If%%lst%% as the trial judge%%lst%% I had been unable to continue ]f[ any reason after the hearing had commenced%%lst%% the parties would have faced the horrendous prospect of having to restart the trial afresh%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It is true that in the event of the death ]v[ serious illness ]v[ injury of a trial judge (for example%%lst%% in consequence of falling off a ladder)%%lst%% the parties may be able to agree that a new judge should deal with the case on the papers%%lst%% perhaps supplemented by limited oral argument%%per%%]$~ 
~$[But the feasibility of that solution may depend upon the point at which the trial has to be aborted%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Moreover%%lst%% it may ]n[ be easy to proceed on the papers when ]s[ much turns on the credit of key witnesses ]^[ when the documentary evidence is ]s[ vast%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Furthermore%%lst%% continuing in this manner presupposes a willingness by the parties to co%%dsh%%operate in the conduct of any re%%dsh%%trial%%per%% 
65 I asked at a pre%%dsh%%trial directions hearing whether the parties in the present case had considered insuring against the risk of judicial death ]v[ infirmity%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Perhaps out of a sense of delicacy%%lst%% I received no clear answer ]^[ do ]n[ know whether the parties gave consideration to obtaining insurance%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Indeed%%lst%% I do ]n[ know whether insurance of this kind is available%%lst%% at least without the judge being required to submit to a medical examination%%lst%% or%%lst%% %%cmp_if%% it is%%lst%% whether the cost of the insurance is prohibitive%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Be that as it may%%lst%% %%cmp_if%% the trial had been aborted ]f[ any reason the parties ]n[ only would have lost a substantial portion of the costs incurred by them%%lst%% ]b[ would have experienced additional very long delays in finalising the litigation%%per%% 
66 Sooner ]v[ later%%lst%% %%cmp_if%% it has ]n[ happened already%%lst%% mega%%dsh%%litigation will be disrupted by a judge falling ill ]v[ otherwise being unable to continue presiding over the proceedings%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In the future%%lst%% both the courts ]^[ the parties to mega%%dsh%%litigation may need to give careful consideration to this possibility%%per%%]$~ 
~$[One solution to the problem%%lst%% although it would come at a significant cost to the court%%lst%% could be ]f[ a reserve judge to participate in the trial ]^[ to have the authority of the parties to prepare a judgment should the primary trial judge be unable to do so%%per%%]$~ 
~$[This solution may ]n[ be very attractive%%lst%% especially ]f[ the reserve judge%%lst%% ]b[ it may be preferable to the alternative%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Another possibility is ]f[ the trial to be conducted by a panel of two judges%%lst%% with the opinion of the more senior prevailing in the event of disagreement%%per%%]$~ 
~$[This would have the advantage of permitting a division of labour ]^[ an opportunity ]f[ discussion between peers on the complex issues thrown up by mega%%dsh%%litigation%%per%% 
1%%per%%11 A Cautionary Tale 
67 It is appropriate to conclude a Chapter on mega%%dsh%%litigation with a cautionary tale that the parties in the present case would do well to heed closely%%per%%]$~

79 Seven claims%%lst%% among other things%%lst%% that a number of the Respondents engaged in anti%%dsh%%competitive conduct that caused harm to C7 ]^[ ultimately brought about its demise%%per%% 
81 Sky Cable ]^[ Telstra Media operate in partnership a retail pay television service (%%sqt%% Foxtel %%sqt%%) under the brand name %%sqt%% Foxtel %%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Nine operates free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air television channels%%lst%% while Fox Sports compiles ]^[ supplies sporting channels to pay television operators (including Foxtel)%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Until C7 ceased to operate its business%%lst%% Fox Sports ]^[ C7 were competitors%%lst%% although the parties disagree as to the market in which they competed%%per%% 
82 Seven%%sqt%%s causes of action against the News%%lst%% PBL ]^[ Telstra respondents%%lst%% insofar as they are based on anti%%dsh%%competitive conduct causing harm to C7%%lst%% arise out of events%%lst%% ]v[ series of events%%lst%% occurring between mid%%dsh%%1999 ]^[ early 2001%%per%%]$~ 
~$[According to Seven%%lst%% there were three major instances of anti%%dsh%%competitive conduct which caused ]v[ contributed to the demise of C7%%per%% 
83 First %%lst%% during the period from mid%%dsh%%1999 until December 2000%%lst%% when the Australian Football League Ltd (%%sqt%% AFL %%sqt%%) awarded the AFL pay television rights ]f[ 2002 to 2006 to News%%lst%% Foxtel refused to negotiate with C7 ]f[ the carriage of its channels on the Foxtel platform%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The refusal occurred (so Seven argues) even though the C7 channels contained attractive programming%%lst%% including AFL matches (which were ]n[ otherwise available to Foxtel subscribers)%%lst%% ]^[ even though Telstra%%lst%% effectively one of the %%sqt%% Foxtel partners %%sqt%%%%lst%% considered that C7%%sqt%%s proposals%%lst%% %%cmp_if%% accepted%%lst%% would have been highly beneficial to Foxtel%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Seven says that the conduct of Foxtel was designed to harm C7 ]^[ to favour the interests of Fox Sports%%lst%% C7%%sqt%%s competitor in the market ]f[ the supply of sports channels to retail pay television operators%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Indeed%%lst%% Seven says that News ]^[ PBL had the explicit purpose of %%sqt%% killing C7 %%sqt%% ]^[ that Telstra%%lst%% ultimately at least%%lst%% acquiesced in that purpose%%per%% 
84 Secondly %%lst%% at a teleconference held on 13 December 2000%%lst%% a %%sqt%% consortium %%sqt%%%%lst%% including representatives of News%%lst%% Foxtel%%lst%% PBL ]^[ Telstra%%lst%% made an arrangement (referred to in the case as the %%sqt%% Master Agreement %%sqt%%)%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The Master Agreement was intended to facilitate Foxtel%%sqt%%s acquisition of the AFL pay television rights ]f[ the 2002 to 2006 seasons%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The Master Agreement provided ]f[ News to bid ]f[ ]^[ acquire the AFL broadcasting rights ]^[ %%cmp_t%% to sub%%dsh%%license the AFL pay television rights to Foxtel ]^[ the AFL free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air rights to Nine ]^[ Network Ten Pty Ltd (%%sqt%% Ten %%sqt%%)%%lst%% another free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air channel%%lst%% on previously agreed terms%%per%%]$~ 
~$[These terms required Foxtel to pay $30 million per annum%%lst%% plus adjustments%%lst%% ]f[ the AFL pay television rights%%lst%% in circumstances where the Foxtel partners were aware that Foxtel was overpaying ]f[ the rights ]^[ that the acquisition would result in a loss to it over the five year term of the sub%%dsh%%licensing agreement%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The Master Agreement also contemplated that Fox Sports would acquire the pay television rights to National Rugby League (%%sqt%% NRL %%sqt%%) matches ]f[ the 2001 to 2006 seasons from the %%sqt%% NRL Partnership %%sqt%%%%lst%% which (as will appear from Chapter 3) makes all decisions relating to NRL broadcasting rights%%per%% 
85 Pursuant to the Master Agreement%%lst%% News ]^[ Fox Sports successfully bid ]f[ the AFL broadcasting rights ]^[ the NRL pay television rights%%lst%% respectively%%lst%% ]^[ subsequently entered into the various licensing ]^[ other transactions contemplated by the arrangement%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Seven says that the objective ]^[ effect of the Master Agreement were to deprive C7 of the rights to the two %%sqt%% marquee sports %%sqt%% which were essential to C7%%sqt%%s continued existence as a sports channel%%per%%]$~ 
~$[That objective was achieved%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In consequence%%lst%% the two pay television platforms with which C7 had contracts (Optus ]^[ Austar) terminated ]v[ failed to renew their contracts once C7 had lost the AFL pay television rights%%per%% 
(I use the expression %%sqt%% Austar %%sqt%% to refer to either ]v[ both of Austar United Communications Ltd (%%sqt%% Austar United %%sqt%%)%%lst%% the seventeenth respondent%%lst%% ]^[ Austar Entertainment Pty Ltd (%%sqt%% Austar Entertainment %%sqt%%)%%lst%% the eighteenth respondent%%per%% 
) Bereft of both the AFL pay television rights ]^[ the NRL pay television rights%%lst%% C7 could ]n[ continue as a viable sports channel%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It was effectively doomed%%per%% 
86 Thirdly %%lst%% Seven says that during the period from August 1999 until August 2000%%lst%% Foxtel ]^[ Telstra Multimedia repeatedly denied C7%%sqt%%s request ]f[ access to Telstra Multimedia%%sqt%%s hybrid fibre coaxial cable (the %%sqt%% Telstra Cable %%sqt%%)%%per%%]$~ 
~$[C7 made its requests pursuant to the access arbitration regime contained in Pt XIC of the TP Act %%per%%]$~ 
~$[Foxtel ]^[ Telstra Multimedia declined the requests on the ground%%lst%% among others%%lst%% that Foxtel had a %%sqt%% protected contractual right %%sqt%% in relation to the Telstra Cable under the applicable contractual arrangements%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The refusal of access prevented C7 from offering its channels directly to retail pay television subscribers ]^[ prejudiced Seven%%sqt%%s chances of successfully bidding ]f[ the AFL broadcasting rights%%lst%% including the pay television rights%%per%% 
87 The claim based on denial of access to the Telstra Cable loomed larger in Seven%%sqt%%s pleaded case ]^[ in opening %%cmp_ta%% it did in the closing submissions%%per%%]$~

2%%per%%2%%per%%2 Causes of Action Based on Anti%%dsh%%Competitive Conduct Causing Harm to C7 
2%%per%%2%%per%%2%%per%%1 MASTER AGREEMENT%%cln%% THE EFFECTS CASE 
88 Seven says that the Master Agreement (the arrangement made at the teleconference of 13 December 2000) involved two elements%%per%%]$~ 
~$[One required ]v[ contemplated that News would acquire the AFL broadcasting rights%%lst%% while the other required ]v[ contemplated that Fox Sports would acquire the NRL pay television rights%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The acquisition of each set of rights was to occur with the support of the other parties to the Master Agreement%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In particular%%lst%% Foxtel had agreed with News to take defined AFL pay television rights ]f[ $30 million per annum (plus adjustments)%%lst%% should News%%sqt%% bid ]f[ the AFL broadcasting rights succeed%%lst%% while Nine ]^[ Ten had agreed to take the AFL free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air television rights ]f[ a combined fee of $46 million per annum (plus adjustments)%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Together these arrangements constituted what Seven describes as the %%sqt%% Master Agreement Provision %%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[While Seven identifies ]^[ relies on all of these markets%%lst%% its primary case relates to substantial lessening of competition in the wholesale sports channel market%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Seven contends that the demise of C7 substantially lessened competition in that market%%lst%% since C7 was the closest constraint on Fox Sports ]^[ there were substantial barriers to entry into the market%%per%% 
91 The parties to the Master Agreement are said to be News%%lst%% PBL%%lst%% Telstra ]^[ Foxtel (that is%%lst%% Sky Cable ]^[ Telstra Media%%lst%% the partners in Foxtel) (the %%sqt%% Consortium Respondents %%sqt%%)%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Seven argues that the Consortium Respondents made a contract ]v[ arrangement containing a provision which %%sqt%% would have ]v[ be likely to have the effect %%per%%%%per%%%%per%% of substantially lessening competition %%sqt%%%%lst%% ]^[ thus each of them contravened s 45(2)(a)(ii) of the TP Act %%per%% 
92 According to Seven%%lst%% the Consortium Respondents also gave effect to the Master Agreement Provision by entering into the various agreements contemplated by the Master Agreement%%lst%% including the %%sqt%% Foxtel Put %%sqt%% by which Foxtel agreed to take the AFL pay television rights from News at a fee of $30 million per annum%%per%%]$~ 
~$[They each %%cmp_tf%% gave effect to a provision of a contract ]v[ arrangement which had%%lst%% ]v[ was likely to have%%lst%% the effect of substantially lessening competition%%lst%% ]^[ thereby contravened s 45(2)(b)(ii) of the TP Act%%per%% 
2%%per%%2%%per%%2%%per%%2 MASTER AGREEMENT%%cln%% THE PURPOSE CASE 
93 Seven contends that the Consortium Respondents intended that Foxtel should acquire the AFL pay television rights ]f[ 2002 to 2006 ]^[ that C7 should be prevented from acquiring the NRL pay television rights ]f[ 2001 to 2006%%per%% 
94 Accordingly%%lst%% the Consortium Respondents%%lst%% ]v[ some of them%%lst%% contravened s 45(2)(a)(ii) of the TP Act by making a contract ]v[ arrangement containing a provision that had the purpose of substantially lessening competition in each of the four markets identified by Seven%%per%%]$~ 
~$[They also each contravened s 45(2)(b)(ii) of the TP Act %%lst%% by giving effect to a provision that had the purpose of substantially lessening competition%%per%% 
2%%per%%2%%per%%2%%per%%3 TAKING ADVANTAGE OF MARKET POWER 
95 Seven says that during the period from November 1998 to December 2000%%lst%% Foxtel had a substantial degree of power in the retail pay television market%%per%% 
96 Seven%%sqt%%s case is that Foxtel took advantage of its market power ]f[ the purpose of preventing C7 from engaging in competitive conduct in several markets%%lst%% including the retail pay television market ]^[ the wholesale sports channel market%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Seven also contends that Foxtel took advantage of its substantial market power ]f[ the purpose of preventing ]v[ deterring Optus from engaging in competitive conduct in the retail pay television market%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Accordingly%%lst%% Foxtel took advantage of its market power ]f[ one of the purposes proscribed by s 46(1) of the TP Act ]^[ thus contravened that subsection%%per%% 
2%%per%%2%%per%%2%%per%%4 DENIAL OF ACCESS TO THE TELSTRA CABLE 
97 Seven argues that the conduct of Foxtel ]^[ Telstra Multimedia in denying C7 access to retail pay television customers via the Telstra Cable gave effect to a provision in an agreement between them%%lst%% known as the Broadband Co%%dsh%%operation Agreement (%%sqt%% BCA %%sqt%%)%%lst%% which conferred exclusivity of access to the Telstra Cable on Foxtel%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The provision had the effect ]v[ likely effect of substantially lessening competition in the retail pay television market%%lst%% since giving effect to Foxtel%%sqt%%s right of exclusive access deprived C7 of the opportunity to supply its channels directly to retail pay television subscribers%%per%%]$~ 
~$[For this reason Foxtel ]^[ Telstra Media contravened s 45(2)(a)(ii) of the TP Act%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The loss of the opportunity to enter the retail market adversely affected Seven%%sqt%%s chances of acquiring the AFL pay television rights%%per%% 
98 Although this claim was given some prominence during the hearing%%lst%% Seven acknowledges in its Case Summary that the claim need only be addressed %%cmp_if%% all other claims against the Telstra parties fail%%per%% 
2%%per%%2%%per%%2%%per%%5 RELIEF SOUGHT BY SEVEN 
99 Seven seeks damages against the News%%lst%% PBL ]^[ Telstra parties ]^[ Foxtel (Sky Cable ]^[ Telstra Media) by reason of the anti%%dsh%%competitive conduct directed at C7%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Seven%%sqt%%s primary claim is based on the value of C7%%sqt%%s lost opportunity to produce ]^[ exploit pay television sports channels%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Seven advances three %%sqt%% mutually exclusive scenarios %%sqt%% ]f[ assessing damages%%lst%% supported by elaborate expert evidence%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Seven%%sqt%%s claim ]f[ damages arising out of the contraventions already outlined relies on %%sqt%% Scenario 1 %%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Scenario 1 assumes that in the absence of the unlawful anti%%dsh%%competitive conduct (that is%%lst%% in the %%sqt%% counter%%dsh%%factual world %%sqt%%)%%lst%% C7 would have retained the AFL pay television rights ]f[ the 2002 to 2006 seasons%%lst%% ]b[ would ]n[ have acquired the NRL pay television rights ]f[ 2001 to 2007%%per%% 
100 On this basis%%lst%% Seven claims that the net present value (%%sqt%% NPV %%sqt%%) of its lost opportunity as at February 2002%%lst%% taking account of other relatively modest compensable losses (such as C7%%sqt%%s close%%dsh%%down costs)%%lst%% is between $194%%per%%8 million ]^[ $212%%per%%3 million%%per%%]$~ 
~$[These figures are%%lst%% however%%lst%% calculated on the assumption that C7 would have been able to acquire the AFL pay television rights ]f[ the 2002 to 2006 seasons ]f[ $22 million per annum (plus adjustments)%%per%%]$~ 
~$[If it be assumed that C7 would have had to pay $30 million per annum (plus adjustments) ]f[ the AFL pay television rights (the amount Foxtel in fact paid)%%lst%% the damages recoverable under Scenario 1%%lst%% on Seven%%sqt%%s calculations%%lst%% are reduced to between $167%%per%%4 million ]^[ $182%%per%%5 million%%per%% 
101 It is common ground that any damages award should be %%sqt%% grossed up %%sqt%% ]f[ the effect of income tax%%lst%% by using a multiplier of 1%%per%%429%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In addition%%lst%% Seven seeks pre%%dsh%%judgment interest calculated from the valuation date%%per%% 
102 Seven also seeks declaratory ]^[ injunctive relief against the News%%lst%% PBL ]^[ Telstra parties%%lst%% although Seven no longer presses some forms of relief claimed in the Application%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The %%sqt%% structural relief%%sqt%% sought by Seven includes orders requiring News ]^[ PBL to divest themselves of their direct ]v[ indirect interests in Sky Cable ]^[ Foxtel%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In final oral submissions%%lst%% Mr Sheahan SC agreed on behalf of Seven that the sensible course was to defer the final resolution of Seven%%sqt%%s claim to non%%dsh%%pecuniary relief until I make the necessary factual findings ]^[ reach conclusions as to the nature of the contravening conduct%%lst%% %%cmp_if%% any%%per%% 
2%%per%%2%%per%%3 Anti%%dsh%%Competitive Conduct%%cln%% The Foxtel%%dsh%%Optus CSA 
103 Seven also mounts a case based on anti%%dsh%%competitive conduct which is said to have taken place after the award of the AFL broadcasting rights ]^[ the NRL pay television rights in December 2000%%per%%]$~ 
~$[This case rests primarily on the purpose ]^[ effect of the Foxtel%%dsh%%Optus Content Supply Agreement ( %%sqt%%Foxtel%%dsh%%Optus CSA %%sqt%%)%%lst%% entered into on 5 March 2002 between the %%sqt%% Foxtel Partnership %%sqt%% (Sky Cable ]^[ Telstra Media in partnership)%%lst%% the sixteenth respondent%%lst%% Optus Vision%%lst%% ]^[ other Optus entities%%per%% 
104 The fourth respondent%%lst%% Foxtel Management Pty Ltd (%%sqt%% Foxtel Management %%sqt%%) was also a party to the Foxtel%%dsh%%Optus CSA%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Foxtel Management is owned equally by Sky Cable ]^[ Telstra Media%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It carries on the business of Foxtel as its agent%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Optus Vision at all material times has been a retail pay television provider%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Prior to the Foxtel%%dsh%%Optus CSA%%lst%% Optus Vision was a competitor of Foxtel%%lst%% although the parties disagree both as to the relevant market ]^[ the extent to which Optus Vision acted as a constraint on Foxtel in the market%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Optus Vision forms part of the Optus Group%%lst%% which provides a range of telecommunications services ]^[ thus at all material times has been a competitor of Telstra%%lst%% at least in relation to certain services%%per%% 
105 The Foxtel%%dsh%%Optus CSA provides that Optus Vision has the right to receive ]^[ broadcast all of Foxtel%%sqt%%s channels ]^[ that Optus Vision must make all the channels it produces ]^[ most of its other content available to Foxtel ]f[ broadcast on the Foxtel Service%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The Foxtel%%dsh%%Optus CSA also contains pricing arrangements which Seven says limit Optus Vision%%sqt%%s ability to compete with Foxtel on the price charged to retail subscribers%%per%% 
106 Seven%%sqt%%s principal case is that the effect ]v[ likely effect of the relevant provisions of the Foxtel%%dsh%%Optus CSA was to substantially lessen competition in the retail pay television market%%lst%% in contravention of s 45(2) of the TP Act %%per%%]$~ 
~$[Seven recognises that before the Foxtel%%dsh%%Optus CSA was executed%%lst%% Optus%%sqt%% pay television business was experiencing difficulties%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It also acknowledges (although this was in dispute until the final submissions) that had the Foxtel%%dsh%%Optus CSA ]n[ been executed%%lst%% Optus would have adopted a %%sqt%% Manage ]f[ Cash %%sqt%% strategy that involved it winding down its retail pay television business%%per%% 
107 However%%lst%% Seven says that%%lst%% ]b[ ]f[ the Foxtel%%dsh%%Optus CSA%%lst%% Optus would have continued as a pay television operator ]^[ would have sought actively to retain subscribers ]^[ to acquire attractive programming%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Optus would %%cmp_tf%% have continued to compete with Foxtel%%per%%]$~ 
~$[According to Seven%%lst%% the effect of the Foxtel%%dsh%%Optus CSA provisions was that Optus ceased to impose competitive constraints on Foxtel%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In particular%%lst%% there was little ]v[ no product differentiation between the two services ]^[ a significant reduction in the price competition that otherwise would have taken place%%per%% 
108 Seven further says that the Foxtel%%dsh%%Optus CSA contains %%sqt%% exclusionary provisions %%sqt%% within the meaning of s 4D of the TP Act %%per%%]$~ 
~$[Accordingly%%lst%% the entry into the Foxtel%%dsh%%Optus CSA constituted a contravention of s 45(2)(a)(i) of the TP Act (which forbids the making of an agreement containing an %%sqt%% exclusionary provision %%sqt%%)%%per%% 
109 Seven seeks damages ]f[ the loss of a valuable opportunity to enter into a three year agreement ]f[ the supply of the C7 channels to Optus on terms that had been discussed with Optus in September 2001%%per%%]$~ 
~$[One possible issue to which this claim gives rise is how it can be reconciled with Seven%%sqt%%s contention that C7 was doomed to extinction by the Master Agreement Provision%%per%% 
2%%per%%3 Seven%%sqt%%s Claims Arising out of the NRL Bidding Process 
110 Seven relies on a number of causes of action%%lst%% independently of its claims based on anti%%dsh%%competitive conduct%%lst%% arising out of the process by which the NRL Partnership awarded the NRL pay television rights to Fox Sports in December 2000%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The partners in the NRL Partnership are the twelfth respondent%%lst%% the Australian Rugby Football League Ltd (%%sqt%% ARL %%sqt%%) ]^[ the thirteenth respondent%%lst%% National Rugby League Investments Pty Ltd (%%sqt%% NRLI %%sqt%%)%%per%%]$~ 
~$[NRLI is a subsidiary of News%%per%% 
111 Seven%%sqt%%s principal claim is that the nineteenth respondent%%lst%% Mr Ian Huntly Philip (%%sqt%% Mr Philip %%sqt%%)%%lst%% disclosed confidential information relating to the terms of an offer ]f[ the NRL pay television rights which Seven made to the NRL Partnership on 5 December 2000%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Philip at the time%%lst%% among other positions held by him%%lst%% was Chief General Counsel of News%%lst%% a director of Sky Cable ]^[ a member of the NRL Partnership Executive Committee (%%sqt%% NRL PEC %%sqt%%)%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The NRL PEC made decisions on behalf of the NRL Partnership%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Seven claims that Mr Philip disclosed the confidential information to Foxtel%%lst%% News%%lst%% PBL%%lst%% Telstra ]^[ Fox Sports in circumstances which%%lst%% as they were aware%%lst%% breached confidentiality%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Seven says that these parties misused the confidential information to Seven%%sqt%%s disadvantage%%per%%]$~ 
~$[According to Seven%%lst%% the unauthorised use of the confidential information enabled Fox Sports to make a successful bid ]f[ the NRL pay television rights%%per%% 
112 Seven also claims that the NRL Partnership ]^[ NRLI represented to Seven that C7%%sqt%%s bid ]f[ the NRL pay television rights would be treated in a fair ]^[ impartial manner (%%sqt%% the fair process representation %%sqt%%)%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The representation is said to have been misleading ]^[ deceptive %%cmp_b%% there were no reasonable grounds ]f[ making it ]^[ in fact (so Seven says) the NRL Partnership ultimately accepted an inferior bid ]f[ the NRL pay television rights %%cmp_ta%% that put forward by C7%%per%% 
113 Seven seeks equitable compensation ]f[ the losses sustained by C7 by reason of Mr Philip%%sqt%%s disclosure of confidential information%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Alternatively%%lst%% Seven seeks an account of the profits derived by News%%lst%% PBL%%lst%% Telstra ]^[ Fox Sports in consequence of their misuse of the confidential information%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It also seeks damages ]f[ losses sustained by reason of the making of the fair process representation%%per%% 
114 The claim ]f[ equitable compensation is based on %%sqt%% Scenario 3 %%sqt%%%%lst%% which assumes that%%lst%% ]b[ ]f[ the breach of confidence%%lst%% C7 would have acquired the NRL pay television rights ]f[ 2001 to 2006%%lst%% ]b[ would ]n[ have acquired the AFL pay television rights ]f[ 2002 ]v[ any later years%%per%%]$~ 
~$[On this basis%%lst%% Seven seeks equitable compensation ]f[ C7%%sqt%%s loss of opportunity to exploit the rights (plus certain other losses such as the close%%dsh%%down costs)%%lst%% which is calculated to have a net present value of between $85%%per%%9 million ]^[ $104%%per%%5 million calculated as at February 2002%%per%%]$~ 
~$[These amounts must be grossed up ]f[ tax ]^[ (according to Seven) also require the addition of pre%%dsh%%judgment interest calculated from the valuation date%%per%%

~$[Optus Vision ]^[ C7 were in dispute%%lst%% however%%lst%% as to the date on which the right to terminate could be exercised%%per%%]$~ 
~$[As a result of negotiations%%lst%% the parties entered into what was described as the %%sqt%% First Variation Agreement%%sqt%% in September 2001%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The First Variation Agreement amended the C7%%dsh%%Optus CSA%%lst%% inter alia%%lst%% by inserting the so%%dsh%%called %%sqt%% Exclusivity Clause %%sqt%% (which became cl 8A of the C7%%dsh%%Optus CSA) ]^[ by clarifying the date on which Optus Vision could exercise its right of termination%%per%%]$~

~$[I have rejected a simple chronological approach in favour of ordering the material by reference to topics%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Each of the six Chapters deals with a particular aspect of the case%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The account within each Chapter is more ]v[ less in chronological order%%lst%% although events are grouped under sub%%dsh%%headings by subject matter%%per%% 
132 This thematic approach has the advantage of recording events in a form that allows them most readily to be related to the various claims made by Seven%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It has the disadvantage that the events cannot%%lst%% in truth%%lst%% be neatly compartmentalised according to subject matter%%per%%]$~ 
~$[For example%%lst%% certain discussions%%lst%% such as those occurring at the teleconference of 13 December 2000%%lst%% related to both the AFL broadcasting rights ]^[ the NRL pay television rights%%per%%]$~

2%%per%%7 Summary of Conclusions 
2%%per%%7%%per%%1 General Observations 
151 Before summarising the conclusions I have reached on Seven%%sqt%%s case ]^[ Optus%%sqt%% Cross%%dsh%%Claim%%lst%% it is appropriate to make some general observations%%per%%]$~ 
~$[These comments are designed to assist in placing this very lengthy ]^[ complex case in context%%per%% 
152 First %%lst%% it was part of Seven%%sqt%%s strategy ]f[ a long period of time to claim that a bid by Foxtel ]f[ the AFL pay television rights would constitute unlawful anti%%dsh%%competitive conduct%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Moreover%%lst%% Seven was seriously contemplating litigation against the Consortium Respondents (or some of them) in respect of the loss ]v[ possible loss of the AFL pay television rights well before the AFL actually awarded the rights ]f[ 2002 to 2006 in December 2000%%per%%]$~ 
~$[For example%%lst%% on 22 November 1999 Mr Stokes conveyed to the AFL a threat that any bid by Foxtel ]f[ the AFL pay television rights would be a breach of the TP Act %%per%%]$~ 
~$[In May 2000%%lst%% Mr Stokes told Dr Switkowski that he was considering wide%%dsh%%ranging legal options to protect Seven%%sqt%%s interests in the AFL pay television rights%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Prior to the AFL%%sqt%%s award of the broadcasting rights%%lst%% Seven unsuccessfully sought the intervention of the ACCC in the bidding process%%per%%]$~ 
~$[At Seven%%sqt%%s annual general meeting on 18 November 2000%%lst%% Mr Stokes warned of a damages claim against Foxtel %%cmp_if%% Seven lost the AFL pay television rights%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Stokes conceded in evidence that%%lst%% by that time%%lst%% he was giving serious consideration to suing the parties bidding ]f[ the AFL broadcasting rights%%per%% 
153 If a party embarks on a strategy of the kind adopted by Seven in this case%%lst%% ]y[ continues to deal with those whom it accuses of anti%%dsh%%competitive conduct%%lst%% its own conduct may well be influenced ]^[ its perceptions coloured by the very strategy it is following%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The risk of that happening is increased %%cmp_if%% the strategy includes litigation%%lst%% %%cmp_b%% there must be a strong temptation to act in a manner that is calculated to improve the chances of success in the forensic battle to come%%per%% 
154 The impending litigation itself may shape the recollections of those who ultimately give evidence%%lst%% particularly %%cmp_if%% the litigation is seen as critical to the fortunes of the prospective litigant%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Of course%%lst%% the reconstruction of events through a prism of self%%dsh%%interest is a common feature of litigation in which the facts are strongly disputed%%per%%]$~ 
~$[But %%cmp_if%% a party implements a litigious strategy while the relevant events are still unfolding%%lst%% the pressures to reconstruct ]v[ interpret events in a manner that reflects the party%%sqt%%s objectives may be very intense%%per%% 
155 In my view%%lst%% Seven%%sqt%%s case has been affected by these factors%%per%%]$~ 
~$[As my findings indicate%%lst%% certain of Seven%%sqt%%s witnesses frequently reconstructed events in a manner that ]n[ merely reflected Seven%%sqt%%s interests%%lst%% ]b[ could ]n[ withstand critical examination%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In particular%%lst%% the accounts of those witnesses could ]n[ be reconciled%%lst%% in important respects%%lst%% with the contemporaneous documentation%%per%% 
156 Secondly %%lst%% the gist of Seven%%sqt%%s complaint against the Consortium Respondents is that they engaged in anti%%dsh%%competitive conduct in relation to the acquisition of the AFL pay television rights ]^[ the NRL pay television rights%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Seven also complains that Foxtel took advantage of its market power to refuse C7%%sqt%%s offer to supply channels ]f[ broadcast on the Foxtel platform%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Seven relies on the provisions of the TP Act that aim to promote competition and%%lst%% to that end%%lst%% prohibit certain forms of anti%%dsh%%competitive conduct%%per%% 
157 It is ]n[ essential that a party which invokes the TP Act to attack allegedly anti%%dsh%%competitive practices of its rivals should itself be a paragon of competitive virtue%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Yet it is striking that Seven%%sqt%%s strategy in 1999 ]^[ 2000 ]f[ obtaining the AFL broadcasting rights ]f[ 2002 to 2006 hinged on avoiding a competitive bidding process ]f[ the rights%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Seven had certain advantages in the bidding process%%lst%% including its status as the existing holder of the broadcasting rights%%lst%% its role as a free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air television broadcaster ]^[ its entitlement to a last right of refusal in relation to the AFL free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air television rights ]f[ 2002 to 2006%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Seven sought to exploit these advantages by insisting to the AFL that it would bid only ]f[ the AFL broadcasting rights as a whole ]^[ ]n[ separately ]f[ the pay ]^[ free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air television rights%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Seven also used a variety of techniques%%lst%% including seeking the intervention of the competition regulator%%lst%% to discourage Foxtel from bidding (whether through News ]v[ otherwise) ]f[ the AFL pay television rights%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Seven%%sqt%%s intention was to position itself as the only potential buyer of the AFL broadcasting rights%%per%% 
158 Mr Sumption%%lst%% in his oral closing submissions on behalf of Seven%%lst%% accepted that the logic of Seven%%sqt%%s position in the case is that once News realised that Fox Sports (of which it was the part owner) had a real chance of acquiring the NRL pay television rights%%lst%% News could ]n[ lawfully bid ]f[ the AFL pay television rights as a component of the AFL broadcasting rights%%per%%]$~ 
~$[As I discuss in Chapter 13 ([2172]%%lst%% [2220])%%lst%% Mr Sumption did ]n[ concede that%%lst%% from a policy perspective%%lst%% there was anything odd about this result%%per%%]$~ 
~$[He pointed to steps that the AFL might have taken to generate competitive bids ]f[ its broadcasting rights%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Even so%%lst%% it seems curious that competition law should have the effect%%lst%% in the particular circumstances of this case%%lst%% of conferring upon one potential buyer the opportunity to acquire valuable rights without any opposition from an otherwise willing competitive bidder ]f[ the same rights%%per%%]$~ 
~$[That was the very basis on which the ACCC declined to intervene in the competitive bidding process ]f[ the AFL broadcasting rights%%per%% 
159 Thirdly %%lst%% Seven has consistently maintained that securing the AFL pay television rights was essential to C7%%sqt%%s commercial survival after 2001%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Yet the evidence clearly establishes that Seven failed to make its best offer ]f[ the rights when they became available%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The reasons ]f[ Seven%%sqt%%s quite remarkable failure are also explained in Chapter 13 ([2273]%%dsh%%[2276])%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In essence%%lst%% Seven was the author of its own misfortune%%per%% 
160 I do ]n[ suggest that this finding is determinative of Seven%%sqt%%s case on liability (although it may be significant on the question of damages%%lst%% should that arise)%%per%%]$~ 
~$[But the finding demonstrates that Seven was far from a helpless victim in the face of the allegedly anti%%dsh%%competitive conduct of which it complains%%per%% 
161 Fourthly %%lst%% an important element in Seven%%sqt%%s case is that the Consortium Respondents endorsed a bid ]f[ the AFL pay television rights by Foxtel%%lst%% believing that the price offered was substantially more %%cmp_ta%% the rights were worth ]^[ that the acquisition would prove to be loss%%dsh%%producing ]f[ Foxtel%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It is ]y[ another extraordinary feature of this case that Mr Stokes conceded in cross%%dsh%%examination that he regarded the price paid by the Foxtel Partnership ]f[ the AFL pay television rights as a %%sqt%% good %%sqt%% deal ]f[ a purchaser%%per%%]$~ 
~$[As I explain in Chapters 8 ]^[ 15 %%lst%% this concession makes it very difficult ]f[ Seven to establish the factual foundation ]f[ its %%sqt%% overbidding %%sqt%% contention%%per%% 
162 Fifthly %%lst%% there is more %%cmp_ta%% a hint of hypocrisy in certain of Seven%%sqt%%s contentions%%per%%]$~ 
~$[I particularly have in mind Seven%%sqt%%s claim that Mr Philip divulged confidential information in relation to Seven%%sqt%%s bid ]f[ the NRL pay television rights ]^[ that certain Respondents received the information knowing that it had been obtained in circumstances which breached confidentiality%%per%%]$~ 
~$[I find in Chapter 19 that Seven %%sqt%% leaked %%sqt%% to the media details of its bid%%lst%% thus destroying any confidentiality in the information%%per%%]$~ 
~$[This finding makes it surprising%%lst%% to say the least%%lst%% that the claim was brought in the first place%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Another example is Seven%%sqt%%s complaint that C7 suffered losses by being denied retail access via the Telstra Cable when (as I find) it never had any serious intention that C7 should be a retailer of pay television services%%per%% 
163 By pointing to these matters%%lst%% I do ]n[ intend to imply that the behaviour of all the Respondents was exemplary%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Philip%%lst%% ]f[ example%%lst%% on his own account dishonestly attempted to mislead Telstra into contributing additional support to Fox Sports%%sqt%% bid ]f[ the NRL pay television rights%%per%%]$~ 
~$[News also was content to withhold important information from Telstra%%lst%% in effect its partner in Foxtel%%lst%% ]^[ did ]s[ over a considerable period of time%%per%%]$~ 
~$[But in the end it is Seven which must make out its pleaded case against the Respondents%%per%% 
2%%per%%7%%per%%2 Specific Conclusions 
164 As I have noted%%lst%% Seven%%sqt%%s primary case as to the substantial lessening of competition relates to the wholesale sports channel market%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In Chapter 12 %%lst%% I find that Seven has failed to establish the existence of that market%%per%%]$~ 
~$[I also find that Seven has ]n[ established the existence of either the AFL pay rights market ]v[ the NRL pay rights market on which it relies%%per%%]$~ 
~$[However%%lst%% I conclude that Seven has made out that there was%%lst%% at the relevant times%%lst%% a retail pay television market in the terms pleaded by it%%per%% 
165 It follows from the findings made in Chapter 12%%lst%% that Seven can only succeed in its anti%%dsh%%competitive effects case under s 45(2) of the TP Act %%cmp_if%% the provisions on which it relies had the effect ]v[ likely effect of substantially lessening competition in the retail pay television market%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In Chapter 13 %%lst%% I find that the Master Agreement Provision ]^[ the other provisions relied on by Seven did ]n[ have the effect ]v[ likely effect at the relevant times of substantially lessening competition in that market%%per%%]$~ 
~$[By December 2000 (when the Master Agreement was entered into) ]^[ January 2001 (when the parties gave effect to the Master Agreement Provision)%%lst%% Optus%%sqt%% pay television operations had been experiencing very substantial losses over a period of several years%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The strong likelihood in December 2000 ]^[ January 2001 was that%%lst%% %%cmp_if%% the Master Agreement had ]n[ been entered into ]v[ implemented%%lst%% Optus would have negotiated a content sharing agreement with Foxtel along the lines of the Foxtel%%dsh%%Optus CSA (which was in fact executed on 5 March 2002)%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Thus%%lst%% even in the absence of the Master Agreement Provision%%lst%% Optus would ]n[ have been a significant constraint on Foxtel in the retail pay television market%%per%% 
166 In Chapter 14 %%lst%% I conclude that Seven%%sqt%%s case based on the anti%%dsh%%competitive purpose of the various provisions%%lst%% including the Master Agreement Provision%%lst%% cannot succeed%%per%%]$~ 
~$[By reason of Optus%%sqt%% parlous state%%lst%% any lessening of competition in that market would have occurred quite independently of the fate of C7%%per%% 
167 Although strictly ]n[ necessary to do so%%lst%% I consider in Chapter 14 further construction questions relating to s 45(2)(a)(ii) ]^[ (b)(ii) of the TP Act %%per%%]$~ 
~$[I construe these provisions as requiring all parties responsible ]f[ the inclusion of the impugned provision in the contract%%lst%% arrangement ]v[ understanding to have the subjective purpose of substantially lessening competition%%lst%% %%cmp_if%% a contravention of s 45(2) is to be established%%per%%]$~ 
~$[I find that Telstra was responsible%%lst%% together with the other Consortium Respondents%%lst%% ]f[ including the Master Agreement Provision in the Master Agreement (that is%%lst%% the provision requiring ]v[ contemplating that bids would be made ]f[ both the AFL ]^[ NRL pay television rights)%%per%%]$~ 
~$[But I also find that Telstra did ]n[ have the purpose proscribed by s 45(2)%%lst%% even %%cmp_if%% it is assumed that the other Consortium Respondents did have such a purpose%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Thus Seven%%sqt%%s purpose case under s 45(2) in relation to the Master Agreement Provision fails%%per%% 
168 Seven%%sqt%%s case in relation to the other provisions on which it relies (with one exception) similarly fails %%cmp_b%% Seven cannot show that all parties responsible ]f[ including the provision in the contract%%lst%% arrangement ]v[ understanding shared the purpose proscribed by s 45(2) of the TP Act %%per%%]$~ 
~$[The exception is the so%%dsh%%called News%%dsh%%Foxtel Licence%%lst%% which is ]n[ affected by this particular analysis%%lst%% although I reject Seven%%sqt%%s claim based on the News%%dsh%%Foxtel Licence ]f[ other reasons%%per%% 
169 In view of the conclusions reached in Chapter 14%%lst%% it is ]n[ necessary%%lst%% in order to deal with Seven%%sqt%%s purpose case under s 45(2) of the TP Act %%lst%% to make factual findings about the purpose of News%%lst%% Foxtel ]^[ PBL%%per%%]$~ 
~$[However%%lst%% such findings may be important %%cmp_if%% my construction of s 45(2) is incorrect%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Moreover%%lst%% the purpose of News%%lst%% Foxtel ]^[ PBL may be relevant to Seven%%sqt%%s case that Foxtel took advantage of its market power ]f[ a proscribed purpose in contravention of s 46(1) of the TP Act %%per%%]$~ 
~$[It also has some significance ]f[ the market definition issues%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Accordingly%%lst%% I deal with the factual issues relating to the purpose of News%%lst%% Foxtel ]^[ PBL in Chapter 15%%per%% 
170 I find in Chapter 15 that Seven has ]n[ established that any of News%%lst%% PBL ]^[ Foxtel (Sky Cable ]^[ Telstra Media) had the objective of destroying C7 ]^[ thereby substantially lessening competition%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Seven has ]n[ demonstrated that any of those parties crossed the boundary that distinguishes legitimate%%lst%% albeit aggressive ]^[ even ruthless competitive conduct from anti%%dsh%%competitive behaviour of the kind proscribed by ss 45(2) ]^[ 46(1) of the TP Act %%per%% 
171 In Chapter 16 %%lst%% I conclude that Foxtel did ]n[ take advantage of its power in the retail pay television market in any of the ways alleged by Seven%%per%% 
172 In Chapter 17 %%lst%% I reject Seven%%sqt%%s case based on the conduct of Foxtel ]^[ Telstra Multimedia in denying C7 access to the Telstra Cable%%per%%]$~ 
~$[I find that the requests made by C7 ]f[ retail access were intended to place pressure on Foxtel in relation to other issues%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Seven never intended that C7 should take advantage of retail access via the Telstra Cable%%lst%% should it ever have become available%%per%%]$~ 
~$[I conclude that%%lst%% although Foxtel ]^[ Telstra Multimedia gave effect to a provision in the BCA that conferred on Foxtel exclusive access to the Telstra Cable%%lst%% that provision did ]n[ have the effect ]v[ likely effect of substantially lessening competition in the retail pay television market%%per%% 
173 In Chapter 18 %%lst%% I find that the provisions of the Foxtel%%dsh%%Optus CSA (by which Foxtel ]^[ Optus agreed to share content) did ]n[ have the effect ]v[ likely effect of substantially lessening competition in the retail pay television market%%per%%]$~ 
~$[I reach this conclusion %%cmp_b%%%%lst%% in the absence of the Foxtel%%dsh%%Optus CSA%%lst%% Optus would have adopted the %%sqt%% Manage ]f[ Cash %%sqt%% strategy which would have led to the closure of Optus%%sqt%% pay television operations within three to four years%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In the meantime%%lst%% in the so%%dsh%%called %%sqt%% counter%%dsh%%factual world %%sqt%%%%lst%% Optus would ]n[ have been a significant competitive constraint on Foxtel%%per%% 
174 In Chapter 19 %%lst%% I conclude that Seven%%sqt%%s cause of action founded on breach of confidentiality fails%%per%%]$~ 
~$[I find that%%lst%% although Mr Philip (contrary to his evidence) deliberately disclosed certain information relating to Seven%%sqt%%s bid ]f[ the NRL pay television rights%%lst%% the information lacked the quality of confidentiality %%cmp_b%% Seven had already publicly disclosed it%%per%%]$~ 
~$[I also reject Seven%%sqt%%s contentions on the other causes of action upon which it relies in relation to the award of the NRL pay television rights%%per%% 
175 In Chapter 20 %%lst%% I reject Seven%%sqt%%s claims that Optus engaged in misleading ]v[ deceptive conduct in contravention of s 52 of the TP Act%%per%%]$~ 
~$[However%%lst%% I find that Seven engaged in misleading ]v[ deceptive conduct in the lead%%dsh%%up to Optus executing the First ]^[ Second Variation Agreements%%per%%]$~ 
~$[I conclude that the appropriate relief to which Optus is entitled is an order pursuant to s 87(2)(ba) of the TP Act refusing to permit Seven to enforce the Exclusivity Clause inserted into the C7%%dsh%%Optus CSA by the First ]^[ Second Variation Agreements%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In consequence%%lst%% Seven%%sqt%%s claim based on breach of contract fails%%per%%]$~ 
~$[I conclude that Optus is ]n[ entitled to any further relief%%per%% 
176 In Chapter 21 %%lst%% I conclude that Seven has ]n[ made out the various additional causes of action based on alleged contraventions of the anti%%dsh%%siphoning regime in the BS Act %%lst%% s 45D of the TP Act ]^[ s 45(2) of the TP Act %%per%% 
2%%per%%8 Proposed Orders 
177 The result is that I propose in due course to make orders dismissing Seven%%sqt%%s claims ]f[ relief%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Optus will be directed to bring in Short Minutes of any order it says should be made on its Cross%%dsh%%Claim%%per%% 
178 I intend to defer making final orders until the parties have the opportunity to make submissions on costs%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Although I intend to dismiss Seven%%sqt%%s Application%%lst%% as indicated in Chapter 1%%lst%% I nonetheless propose to give the parties an opportunity to make brief submissions on what issues relating to relief%%lst%% %%cmp_if%% any%%lst%% I should address before entering final orders%%per%%]$~

4%%per%%3%%per%%1 Anti%%dsh%%Siphoning Regime 
317 Much in the case is said to turn on the so%%dsh%%called %%sqt%% anti%%dsh%%siphoning regime %%sqt%% created by the BS Act %%per%%]$~ 
~$[The regime is central to the competing arguments relating to the identification of relevant markets%%per%%]$~ 
~$[An understanding of the regime is also necessary to follow the nature ]^[ form of the transactions that have given rise to this litigation%%per%% 
318 The background to the anti%%dsh%%siphoning regime was explained by the Full Federal Court in Foxtel Cable Television Pty Ltd v Nine Network Australia Pty Ltd (1997) 73 FCR 429%%lst%% at 430%%dsh%%431%%lst%% as follows%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%When parliament decided to make provision%%lst%% in the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 (Cth)%%lst%% ]f[ subscription television%%lst%% one of the issues it needed to confront was what to do about major events%%scn%% events%%lst%% particularly sporting events%%lst%% that the Australian public had long been accustomed to having available on free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air television%%per%%]$~ 
~$[If nothing was done%%lst%% ]^[ market forces were allowed to prevail%%lst%% there was a chance that a subscription service would acquire the exclusive right to televise such an event%%lst%% ]^[ thereby deny everyone ]b[ its subscribers the opportunity to view it on television%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Parliament thought this possibility unacceptable%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Accordingly%%lst%% it included in the Act some provisions that are generally called %%dqt%%the anti%%dsh%%siphoning provisions%%dqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[These provisions do ]n[ force the free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air transmission of a declared event%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Provisions having that effect would have cut across the underlying philosophy of the Act%%lst%% namely%%lst%% that it is generally ]f[ the national broadcasters (the Australian Broadcasting Corporation ]^[ Special Broadcasting Service) ]^[ commercial television broadcasting licensees to determine what programs to televise on the services provided by them%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The anti%%dsh%%siphoning provisions operate indirectly%%per%%]$~ 
~$[They encourage the free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air transmission of declared events by removing any incentive ]f[ a subscription service to %%dqt%%lock away%%dqt%% the exclusive rights%%per%%]$~ 
~$[If it does so%%lst%% it loses its own right to televise the event%%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The expression %%sqt%% anti%%dsh%%siphoning %%sqt%% appears to reflect the intention of the regime that important sporting events should ]n[ be %%sqt%% siphoned %%sqt%% to pay television%%per%% 
319 As the Full Court pointed out in Foxtel Cable v Nine Network 73 FCR%%lst%% at 431%%lst%% the anti%%dsh%%siphoning provisions consist of two elements%%per%%]$~ 
~$[First%%lst%% s 115(1) empowers the Minister%%lst%% by notice published in the Gazette%%lst%% to specify an event ]v[ events of a kind%%lst%% the televising of which should%%lst%% in the opinion of the Minister%%lst%% be available free to the general public%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The Minister has power to amend a notice%%lst%% ]f[ example by specifying an additional event to be included in the list%%cln%% s 115(1A)%%per%%]$~ 
~$[An event specified in a notice is taken to be removed 168 hours after the end of the event unless a declaration to the contrary is made in the meantime%%cln%% s 115(1B)%%per%%]$~ 
~$[A notice is a disallowable instrument ]f[ the purposes of s 46A of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 (Cth)%%cln%% s 115(3) 
320 The second element of the scheme is a standard condition imposed on subscription television licensees (but ]n[ subscription narrowcasting licensees) under Pt 6 of Sch 2 to the BS Act%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The condition is as follows (cl 10(1)(e))%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%the licensee will ]n[ acquire the right to televise%%lst%% on a subscription television broadcasting service%%lst%% an event that is specified in a notice under subsection 115(1) unless%%cln%% 
(i) a national broadcaster has the right to televise the event on any of its broadcasting services%%scn%% ]v[ 
(ii) the television broadcasting services of commercial television broadcasting licensees %%per%%%%per%%%%per%% who have the right to televise the event cover a total of more %%cmp_ta%% 50% of the Australian population%%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[For the purposes of cl 10(1)(e)(ii)%%lst%% %%cmp_if%% a program supplier ]f[ a commercial television broadcasting licence has a right to televise an event%%lst%% the licensee is taken also to have the right%%cln%% cl 10(1B)%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Contravention of a condition of a subscription television broadcasting licence constitutes an offence%%cln%% s 139(2)%%per%% 
321 The parties agree that the expression %%sqt%% right to televise %%per%%%%per%%%%per%% an event %%sqt%% means that a free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air operator must have the right to televise the event as it happens ]v[ as soon thereafter as is technically feasible%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It follows that a right in a pay television provider to broadcast the highlights of an event%%lst%% ]v[ to broadcast the event several days after it takes place%%lst%% does ]n[ involve a breach of cl 10(1)(e) set out above%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The parties%%sqt%% agreement on this issue reflects the holding of the Full Court in Foxtel Cable v Nine Network 73 FCR%%lst%% at 435%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The Court explained the basis ]f[ the holding in the following passage (at 435)%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%It must be remembered that the anti%%dsh%%siphoning provisions are concerned with events of a national nature%%lst%% events that the Minister has adjudged likely to attract widespread public interest%%per%%]$~ 
~$[They will ]n[ necessarily be sporting events%%scn%% the provisions could be used to cover an historical event like a special commemoration ]v[ visit%%per%%]$~ 
~$[But all the events listed in the notice of 6 July 1994 were sporting events ]^[ this may be the future pattern%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Either way%%lst%% events are selected %%cmp_b%% the Minister is of the opinion that many people will wish to feel part of them%%lst%% by seeing them as they occur%%lst%% ]n[ by later seeing a television record of them%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In the present context%%lst%% we do ]n[ think it can be said that a national broadcaster ]v[ television broadcasting licensee has the %%dqt%%right to televise the event%%dqt%% unless that broadcaster ]v[ licensee can televise it as it happens%%lst%% ]v[ as soon thereafter as is technically feasible%%sqt%%%%per%% 
322 As this passage implies%%lst%% the Minister gazetted the first anti%%dsh%%siphoning list on 6 July 1994%%lst%% to prepare ]f[ the introduction of pay television in Australia%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The original list was expressed to continue ]f[ a period of ten years%%lst%% until the end of 2005 (subject to amendment from time to time)%%per%%]$~ 
~$[A new list has been put in place ]f[ the period 1 January 2006 to 31 December 2010%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Thus far%%lst%% only sporting events have been placed on the anti%%dsh%%siphoning list%%per%% 
323 An event can be removed from the anti%%dsh%%siphoning list in any one of three ways%%per%%]$~ 
~$[First%%lst%% as noted above%%lst%% an event is automatically removed from the list seven days after it concludes%%lst%% unless the Minister makes a declaration otherwise%%per%% 
324 Secondly%%lst%% by virtue of amendments to the BS Act which took effect on 20 July 2001%%lst%% an event was automatically delisted six weeks before its scheduled commencement%%lst%% unless the Minister published a declaration that the event continues to be specified in the notice%%cln%% s 115(1AA)%%lst%% inserted by the Broadcasting Legislation Amendment Act (No 2) 2001 (Cth)%%lst%% Sch 1%%lst%% cl 5%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The period of six weeks was changed to 12 weeks as from 1 April 2005%%cln%% Broadcasting Services Amendment (Anti%%dsh%%Siphoning) Act 2005 (Cth)%%lst%% Sch 1%%lst%% cl 1%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The Minister may publish a declaration under s 115(1AA) only %%cmp_if%% satisfied that at least one free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air broadcaster has ]n[ had a reasonable opportunity to acquire the right to televise the event concerned%%cln%% s 115(1AB)%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It follows (as the parties agree) that a sporting event will now be automatically delisted 12 weeks before its scheduled commencement %%cmp_if%% the free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air broadcasters have had a reasonable opportunity to acquire the rights to televise the event%%lst%% ]b[ have elected ]n[ to do so%%per%% 
325 Thirdly%%lst%% the Minister has a general power to remove an event from the list%%lst%% although the amending notice is a disallowable instrument%%cln%% s 115(2)%%lst%% (3)%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Accordingly%%lst%% anyone may apply to the Minister to remove a particular sporting event ]v[ events from the anti%%dsh%%siphoning list%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In practice%%lst%% it appears that the Minister has ]n[ been prepared to remove an event unless satisfied that the free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air broadcasters have had a reasonable opportunity to televise the event%%per%%

~$[Following concern about the failure of the Nine Network to show the first session of the Ashes cricket series in England in 1997%%lst%% Parliament introduced the anti%%dsh%%hoarding regime which%%cln%%

~$[In Australia%%lst%% however%%lst%% the free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air broadcasters have provided channels via terrestrial broadcasts%%per%%]$~ 
~$[These transmissions have been in analogue format%%cln%% that is%%lst%% the transmission uses an analogue modulation technique%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Each analogue free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air service provides a single channel ]f[ viewers that can transmit one continuous stream of programming ]^[ some limited data embedded in the main carrier signal%%lst%% such as teletext%%per%% 
348 Digital transmission of television broadcasts enables multiple programs to be transmitted simultaneously%%lst%% using the same amount of radiofrequency spectrum as is used ]f[ analogue television%%per%%]$~ 
~$[This form of transmission is known as %%sqt%% multi%%dsh%%channelling %%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The Commercial Broadcasters have ]n[ been permitted to transmit programs via multi%%dsh%%channelling%%lst%% subject to a minor exception where a licensee is broadcasting live sports coverage of a sporting event which is delayed ]f[ reasons outside the licensee%%sqt%%s control and%%lst%% in consequence%%lst%% the sporting event broadcast overlaps with a regularly scheduled news program%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The National Broadcasters are permitted to transmit certain programs via multi%%dsh%%channelling%%lst%% %%cmp_if%% the programs are ]n[ provided as part of a subscription service%%per%% 
349 The regulatory scheme governing the introduction of digital free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air television was set up by the Television Broadcasting Services ( Digital Conversion) Act 1998 (Cth)%%lst%% which inserted Sch 4%%lst%% headed %%sqt%% Digital television broadcasting %%sqt%%%%lst%% into the BS Act %%per%%]$~ 
~$[The scheme requires a commercial television broadcasting licensee to comply with the Commercial Television Conversion Scheme (%%sqt%% CTC Scheme %%sqt%%) as a condition of its licence%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The CTC Scheme%%lst%% which was formulated by the ABA%%lst%% specifies arrangements ]f[ the progressive conversion of commercial free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air television transmissions from analogue mode to digital mode%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The ABA has also formulated a counterpart digital conversion scheme ]f[ the National Broadcasters%%per%% 
350 Under the CTC Scheme%%lst%% the ABA has prepared %%sqt%% digital channel plans %%sqt%% which allot additional channels to free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air broadcasters%%per%%]$~ 
~$[This enables the broadcasters to transmit programs in Standard Definition Television (%%sqt%% SDTV %%sqt%%) ]^[ High Definition Television (%%sqt%% HDTV %%sqt%%) digital mode%%lst%% as well as in analogue mode%%lst%% during a %%sqt%%simulcast period%%sqt%%%%per%%]$~

~$[These terms were ]n[ defined in the Agreed Assumptions%%per%%]$~ 
~$[However%%lst%% the evidence indicates that %%sqt%% basic %%sqt%% refers to the basic package which all subscribers to a particular platform must take%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The content of the basic package may vary considerably between platforms ]^[ over time%%per%% 
358 A %%sqt%% tier %%sqt%% comprises a channel ]v[ a package of channels that subscribers to a platform can take in addition to the basic package%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Where the tier comprises a single channel%%lst%% it is often described as an %%sqt%% a la carte %%sqt%% offering ]v[ a %%sqt%% stand alone %%sqt%% channel%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Ordinarily%%lst%% a subscriber pays an additional monthly fee ]f[ the tier%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Typically%%lst%% content offered on a tier appeals to a particular segment of subscribers who are willing to pay extra ]f[ access to that material%%per%% 
359 By way of illustration%%lst%% the Foxtel basic cable package in December 2000 incorporated 29 channels%%lst%% including Fox Sports 1 ]^[ Fox Sports 2 %%lst%% Fox 8 %%lst%% Sky Racing %%lst%% Lifestyle %%lst%% CNN ]^[ Sky News %%per%%]$~ 
~$[The cost of the basic package was $37%%per%%95 per subscriber per month (%%sqt%% pspm %%sqt%%)%%per%%]$~ 
~$[A subscriber wishing to take movie channels on a tier ]v[ tiers paid an additional $10%%per%%00 ]v[ $20%%per%%00 pspm depending on the selection%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Various add%%dsh%%on channels were available a la carte at an additional cost%%lst%% ranging from $6%%per%%95 pspm to $14%%per%%95 pspm (for %%sqt%% Adults Only %%sqt%%)%%per%% 
360 The arrangement between the pay television platform ]^[ the channel supplier whose products are on a tier can differ%%lst%% depending on the content ]^[ its value as a subscription driver%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The distributor may pay a licence fee ]f[ the channel on a tier by reference to the number of subscribers to the basic package%%lst%% even though the subscribers to the tier will always be fewer %%cmp_ta%% the subscribers to the basic package%%per%%]$~ 
~$[This is usually known as payment %%sqt%% as %%cmp_if%% on basic %%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[An alternative is ]f[ the licensing arrangement to be based on the number of subscribers to the tier%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The simplest example%%lst%% although there are various forms%%lst%% is a licence fee calculated as an amount per subscriber (to the tier) per month%%per%% 
4%%per%%7%%per%%3 Bundling 
361 A phenomenon that has played some part in these proceedings is known as %%sqt%% bundling %%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[This occurs where a provider of pay television (not necessarily the compiler of channels) offers a package which combines pay television services with other products%%lst%% such as telephony services%%per%%

~$[In 2000%%lst%% Optus reported that new pay television subscribers taking more %%cmp_ta%% one bundled product had increased to 65 per cent%%per%%]$~ 
~$[By the end of June 2000%%lst%% more %%cmp_ta%% 95 per cent of new Optus pay television subscribers were also taking local telephony services%%per%% 
363 In July 2002%%lst%% Telstra notified the ACCC that it proposed to offer the Foxtel Service bundled with telecommunications services%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The ACCC approved this offering in November 2002%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Prior to this%%lst%% Telstra had been unable to offer a bundled product as News was ]n[ prepared to agree to Telstra reselling the Foxtel Service ]f[ this purpose%%per%%]$~ 
~$[By May 2003%%lst%% Telstra had signed up 100,000 customers to its so%%dsh%%called %%sqt%% Rewards %%sqt%% package%%lst%% although ]n[ all customers taking the package would necessarily have been subscribers to Foxtel%%per%% 
364 In 2002%%lst%% Austar introduced bundling of mobile telephony ]^[ internet services with its pay television service%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In September 2003%%lst%% Telstra Pay TV obtained approval from the ACCC to bundle Austar%%sqt%%s pay television service with Telstra%%sqt%%s telecommunications services in areas that Austar %%cmp_t%% supplied (rural ]^[ regional Australia%%lst%% Hobart ]^[ Darwin)%%per%%

5%%per%%1 General Observations 
367 The credit of a number of witnesses in the present case was challenged%%lst%% sometimes vigorously%%lst%% in cross%%dsh%%examination%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Hutley SC%%lst%% ]f[ example%%lst%% repeatedly accused Mr Stokes ]^[ Mr Gammell of deliberately telling untruths in the course of their evidence%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Philip admitted in his written statements that he lied to Mr Akhurst in December 2000 as part of an attempt to persuade Telstra to support a revised bid by Fox Sports ]f[ the NRL pay television rights%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Philip%%sqt%%s admission that he had lied in his dealings with Telstra did ]n[ render him immune from accusations by Mr Sumption QC that he was ]n[ telling the truth in the witness box about his dealings with Telstra ]v[ his motives ]f[ certain conduct%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Seven also submits that Mr Akhurst%%sqt%%s evidence%%lst%% in certain respects%%lst%% was %%sqt%% ]s[ lacking in credibility that it should be rejected %%sqt%% ]^[ that he was %%sqt%% generally evasive %%sqt%% in the witness box%%per%% 
368 Quite apart from challenges to credit%%lst%% the parties disputed the reliability of at least some evidence given by most of their opponents%%sqt%% lay witnesses%%per%%]$~ 
~$[For example%%lst%% in his closing oral submissions%%lst%% Mr Sumption seemed to abandon a rather half%%dsh%%hearted attempt in Seven%%sqt%%s written submissions to challenge Dr Switkowski%%sqt%%s credit in relation to certain aspects of his evidence%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Instead%%lst%% Mr Sumption submitted that Dr Switkowski had simply forgotten a great deal of material that he had known in 2000%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In particular%%lst%% Mr Sumption invited me to reject on that ground Dr Switkowski%%sqt%%s evidence that%%lst%% even %%cmp_if%% News%%sqt%% purpose in acquiring the AFL broadcasting rights included bringing about C7%%sqt%%s demise%%lst%% he did ]n[ appreciate that fact at the time he gave Telstra%%sqt%%s support to News%%sqt%% bid%%per%% 
369 In Australia%%lst%% appellate courts recognise that there are %%sqt%% natural limitations %%sqt%% that affect the scope of an appeal on findings of fact in cases where the appellate court is confined to the record of the proceedings at first instance%%cln%% Fox v Percy [2003] HCA 22 %%scn%% (2003) 214 CLR 118 at 125%%dsh%%126 [23] %%lst%% per Gleeson CJ%%lst%% Gummow ]^[ Kirby JJ%%scn%% CSR Ltd v Della Maddalena [2006] HCA 1 %%scn%% (2006) 224 ALR 1 at 7 [17] %%lst%% per Kirby J (with whom Gleeson CJ agreed)%%per%%]$~ 
~$[These limitations%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%include the disadvantage that the appellate court has when %%cmp%%d with the trial judge in respect of the evaluation of witnesses%%sqt%% credibility ]^[ of the %%dqt%%feeling%%dqt%% of a case which an appellate court%%lst%% reading the transcript%%lst%% cannot always fully share%%per%%]$~

~$[These observations tend to accord with the experience of trial judges ]^[ are reinforced by my assessment of much of the evidence in this case%%per%% 
373 The present judgment follows a trial at which a great deal of evidence was given by many witnesses%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It is ]n[ an appellate judgment%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Nonetheless%%lst%% the observations in Fox v Percy are pertinent to the fact%%dsh%%finding process a trial judge is required to undertake%%per%%]$~

~$[It may be quite inappropriate%%lst%% to take an example ]n[ relevant to this case%%lst%% to regard an indigenous person%%sqt%%s apparent unwillingness to make eye contact ]^[ hesitancy in answering questions as demonstrating untruthfulness%%per%%]$~

374 In this case%%lst%% most of the lay witnesses gave evidence about events occurring some years before they signed their witness statements ]^[ an even longer period before they gave oral evidence in the proceedings%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The crucial events occurred%%lst%% ]f[ the most part%%lst%% in 1999 ]^[ 2000%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Accordingly%%lst%% witnesses giving oral evidence in 2005 ]^[ 2006 were being asked to recall meetings%%lst%% conversations ]^[ transactions that had taken place between five ]^[ seven years earlier%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Similarly%%lst%% when witnesses were asked about their motivation ]f[ particular actions%%lst%% ]v[ their intentions at certain times%%lst%% they were being asked to cast their mind back perhaps six ]v[ seven years%%lst%% to the time when they took the actions ]v[ formed their intentions%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It is expecting a great deal of any witness to remember clearly what was said at a meeting ]v[ what he ]v[ she was thinking at a given time from a distance of half a decade ]v[ more%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It is even more difficult when the recollection necessarily involves reconstruction in the context of litigation%%per%%]$~

~$[Mr Sumption might have added that it is particularly difficult when the litigation is the outcome of a strategy formed well before the proceedings commenced%%per%% 
375 As I have noted%%lst%% an enormous volume of documentation (including electronically stored material) contemporaneous with the relevant events was produced ]v[ identified by the parties on discovery ]^[ in response to notices to produce (although%%lst%% ]f[ reasons that I shall explain%%lst%% the News parties produced relatively little)%%per%%]$~

~$[Nonetheless%%lst%% as I have explained in Chapter 1%%lst%% there was a very large volume of documentation in evidence%%per%%]$~

380 The witnesses had undertaken varying degrees of preparation ]f[ giving their evidence ]^[ had different perceptions of the litigation ]^[ their role in it%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Some%%lst%% plainly enough%%lst%% felt aggrieved that they had been embroiled in the litigation%%per%%]$~ 
~$[For example%%lst%% in a moment of frustration%%lst%% when his veracity was under challenge%%lst%% Mr Mockridge said that he regarded the case as %%sqt%% bizarre %%sqt%% ]^[ the fact that he was in the witness box as also %%sqt%% bizarre %%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Philip%%lst%% ]n[ surprisingly in view of his admissions%%lst%% manifested clear signs of discomfort at various points in his cross%%dsh%%examination%%per%% 
381 Mr Stokes was clearly one of the driving forces behind the proceedings instituted by Seven%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Perhaps surprisingly%%lst%% he was prepared to undergo what he must have known would be a long ]^[ searching cross%%dsh%%examination in which his credibility would come under sustained attack%%per%%]$~ 
~$[While Mr Stokes may ]n[ have foreseen quite how long ]^[ searching the cross%%dsh%%examination would be%%lst%% he appeared on the surface%%lst%% with a few exceptions%%lst%% to be relatively unruffled by the experience%%per%% 
382 In my opinion%%lst%% Mr Stokes%%sqt%% generally calm demeanour in the witness box illustrates the caution that is necessary before relying on a witness%%sqt%% appearance ]v[ behaviour as a clear indication of the reliability ]v[ otherwise of his ]v[ her evidence%%per%%]$~ 
~$[As Seven points out ]^[ I accept%%lst%% Mr Stokes was subject to a vigorous%%lst%% sometimes aggressive cross%%dsh%%examination conducted in the full glare of publicity (although I do ]n[ regard the cross%%dsh%%examination as having exceeded the bounds of propriety)%%per%%]$~ 
~$[During his 14 days of cross%%dsh%%examination%%lst%% Mr Stokes remained unfailingly calm ]^[ polite even in the face of repeated claims that his evidence was fabricated%%per%%]$~ 
~$[For the most part%%lst%% Mr Stokes%%sqt%% answers were laconic%%per%% 
383 Mr Stokes showed considerable self%%dsh%%control ]^[ great determination throughout his period in the witness box%%per%%]$~ 
~$[These characteristics were particularly striking%%lst%% since Mr Stokes is clearly accustomed to being in control of his business environment%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Occasionally this became apparent as when%%lst%% in response to a question%%lst%% he commented somewhat sharply that he was %%sqt%% ]n[ used to being instructed by one of our managers in what to do %%sqt%%%%per%% 
384 The question%%lst%% however%%lst%% is what inferences%%lst%% %%cmp_if%% any%%lst%% should be drawn from Mr Stokes%%sqt%% controlled demeanour%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Seven submits that on the basis of his demeanour that I should infer that Mr Stokes is a man of %%sqt%% sincere ]^[ strongly held convictions %%sqt%% ]^[ that his evidence was given %%sqt%% honestly ]^[ with care %%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[There is little doubt that Mr Stokes is a man of sincere ]^[ strongly held convictions%%lst%% although I would have reached this conclusion independently of his demeanour when giving evidence%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Stokes%%sqt%% demeanour demonstrated clearly enough that he was well able to suppress outward manifestations of the emotions that must have been stirred by the nature of the cross%%dsh%%examination ]^[ by his inability to control the course of the proceedings%%per%%]$~ 
~$[However%%lst%% I do ]n[ think that Mr Stokes%%sqt%% generally calm ]^[ controlled demeanour in the witness box%%lst%% of itself%%lst%% provides a great deal of assistance in assessing Mr Stokes%%sqt%% reliability on contested issues%%per%%]$~ 
~$[This%%lst%% however%%lst%% is ]n[ to suggest that Mr Stokes%%sqt%% demeanour when responding to particular questions was ]n[ of assistance in making findings on factual questions%%per%%]$~

5%%per%%2%%per%%1 Mr Stokes 
385 It is one thing ]f[ Mr Stokes to have been prepared to pursue this litigation notwithstanding the enormous outlay of costs incurred by Seven (in which he has a substantial interest)%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It is quite another ]f[ him to have been willing to give evidence%%per%% 
386 In retrospect%%lst%% it may have been possible ]f[ Seven to conduct this litigation without Mr Stokes going into the witness box%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In his final oral submissions%%lst%% Mr Sumption was at pains to contend that issues of credit%%lst%% ]s[ far as Seven%%sqt%%s witnesses are concerned%%lst%% go primarily to causation ]^[ damages%%lst%% rather %%cmp_ta%% liability%%per%%]$~ 
~$[No doubt this submission recognises the difficulties in the path of accepting some of the evidence given by Seven%%sqt%%s witnesses%%per%%]$~ 
~$[But it also reflects the fact that Seven perhaps might have run its case without Mr Stokes subjecting himself to cross%%dsh%%examination%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In the absence of Mr Stokes%%lst%% Seven might have been foreclosed from persisting with its more extravagant claims ]f[ relief%%lst%% ]b[ ]f[ the most part these have been effectively abandoned in any event%%per%% 
387 Mr Stokes%%sqt%% willingness to give evidence is somewhat perplexing%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Not only must he have known that he would face a gruelling cross%%dsh%%examination%%lst%% ]b[ it must have been apparent to him well before he stepped into the witness box%%lst%% that his account of events was likely to prove vulnerable at many points%%per%%]$~ 
~$[As became clear in the course of cross%%dsh%%examination%%lst%% his evidence was repeatedly at odds with the contents of the contemporaneous documentation%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Time after time%%lst%% Mr Stokes asserted that important discussions had taken place at board meetings ]v[ %%cmp_e%%where%%lst%% when the relevant minutes ]v[ other contemporaneous records contained no reference to them%%per%%]$~ 
~$[He also maintained that he had been unaware of matters that%%lst%% according to the records%%lst%% had been discussed in his presence%%per%%]$~ 
~$[This judgment is replete with examples%%per%% 
388 Mr Stokes is plainly a highly intelligent%%lst%% shrewd ]^[ determined person%%per%%]$~ 
~$[These attributes%%lst%% ]^[ others%%lst%% have undoubtedly contributed to his very considerable business success%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It would be surprising %%cmp_if%% a person of Mr Stokes%%sqt%% intelligence ]^[ shrewdness did ]n[ appreciate the difficulties in the path of accepting much of his evidence%%lst%% insofar as it was a matter of dispute%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It would be particularly surprising%%lst%% given that Seven had access to ]^[ availed itself of legal advice at every stage of the litigation (and indeed on many occasions beforehand)%%per%%]$~ 
~$[This is ]n[ a dispute (or series of disputes) in which expense has been spared%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Stokes%%sqt%% legal advisers would have had every opportunity to draw his attention%%lst%% in an appropriate way%%lst%% to the apparent disparities between his version of events ]^[ the contemporaneous documentation%%per%% 
389 In assessing Mr Stokes%%sqt%% evidence I have taken into account a number of factors in his favour%%per%% 
390 I should also record that there were occasions on which Mr Stokes made concessions in a reasonably straightforward manner%%per%%]$~ 
~$[An example of what I regard as an important concession was his agreement that the successful offer Foxtel made ]f[ the AFL pay television rights (through the Foxtel Put) was %%sqt%% a good price %%sqt%% (for Foxtel)%%per%% 
391 Even taking these matters into account%%lst%% however%%lst%% there were simply too many occasions on which Mr Stokes%%sqt%% evidence was implausible ]f[ me to regard him as a reliable witness on disputed issues%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Sometimes it is extremely difficult ]v[ impossible to reconcile his version of events with the contemporaneous records%%lst%% the reliability of which there is no good reason to doubt%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Sometimes Mr Stokes%%sqt%% evidence flies in the face of incontrovertible facts%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Sometimes%%lst%% he changed his evidence when confronted with material that made it virtually impossible to maintain the position he had previously adopted%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Sometimes Mr Stokes%%sqt%% evidence conflicted with that of other witnesses (including%%lst%% on occasions%%lst%% witnesses called by Seven) whose accounts are%%lst%% in my view%%lst%% reliable%%per%% 
392 So far as contemporaneous records are concerned%%lst%% there may be%%lst%% as Mr Sumption submits%%lst%% a difference between an apparently reliable record that omits reference to a discussion ]v[ event that a witness says took place%%lst%% ]^[ a similar record that includes reference to a discussion ]v[ event that the witness denies occurred%%per%%]$~ 
~$[However%%lst%% Seven adduced no evidence to counter the inference that the minutes of board ]^[ committee meetings within Seven were intended to be reasonably reliable records of the meetings prepared by competent people%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In any event%%lst%% it is often difficult to think of a plausible reason why the contemporaneous records would have omitted reference to a particular discussion ]v[ event that Mr Stokes said took place%%lst%% %%cmp_if%% indeed it did%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Further%%lst%% Mr Stokes on a number of occasions denied knowledge of important information%%lst%% such as the state of C7%%sqt%%s negotiations with Austar%%lst%% that the contemporaneous documentation overwhelmingly suggests was drawn to his attention%%per%% 
393 A trial judge in civil proceedings should exercise caution before pronouncing that a witness has given deliberately false evidence%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Often it is necessary only to determine whether the witness%%sqt%% evidence%%lst%% insofar as it is relevant to the issues%%lst%% should be accepted in whole%%lst%% in part ]v[ ]n[ at all%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It may ]n[ matter very much%%lst%% ]f[ the purposes of deciding the litigation%%lst%% whether a witness found to be unreliable has told deliberate untruths ]v[ has given unsatisfactory evidence ]f[ other reasons%%per%% 
394 However%%lst%% in this case a sustained ]^[ vigorous attack was mounted against Mr Stokes%%sqt%% credit%%lst%% including his honesty as a witness%%per%%]$~ 
~$[I think it appropriate to observe that%%lst%% although some of the particular attacks on Mr Stokes%%sqt%% credit lacked cogency%%lst%% there were occasions on which%%lst%% in my opinion%%lst%% he gave evidence that he knew was ]n[ true%%per%%]$~ 
~$[One example was a particularly unconvincing denial that he did ]n[ share the objective of others within Seven of %%sqt%% ramping %%sqt%% the price that News (through Fox Sports) would ultimately have to pay ]f[ the NRL pay television rights by outbidding Seven%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Stokes participated in a conference at which the objective was discussed and%%lst%% on his own admission%%lst%% said nothing to dissociate himself from the views expressed there%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Gammell gave evidence that everyone at the meeting agreed with the ramping objective%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Internal Seven documentation makes it clear that ramping was%%lst%% at the very least%%lst%% a critical (if ]n[ the only) objective underlying the bidding by Seven ]f[ the NRL pay television rights%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Stokes%%sqt%% evidence on this issue was ]n[ only implausible but%%lst%% I must conclude%%lst%% deliberately false%%per%% 
395 Similarly%%lst%% I must conclude that Mr Stokes%%sqt%% professed ignorance about the state of negotiations between Seven ]^[ Austar could ]n[ have been a mere failure of memory%%per%%]$~ 
~$[This evidence went to the damages sought by Seven ]^[ Mr Stokes understood its importance%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Stokes repeatedly denied that matters came to his attention over a substantial period of time%%lst%% notwithstanding much documentary evidence to the contrary%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The inaccuracy of Mr Stokes%%sqt%% evidence on this point%%lst%% in my view%%lst%% was ]n[ the product of inadvertence%%per%% 
396 Having said that%%lst%% it is also appropriate to record my view that the unreliability of Mr Stokes%%sqt%% evidence was%%lst%% in part%%lst%% a product of his reconstruction of events through the prism of self%%dsh%%interest%%lst%% layered with more %%cmp_ta%% a little wishful thinking%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Stokes%%sqt%% evidence demonstrates that he was extremely resolute ]^[ persistent in pursuit of his ]^[ Seven%%sqt%%s business objectives%%lst%% sometimes to the point of obstinacy%%per%%]$~ 
~$[His relentless attempts to enlist the ACCC as an ally in Seven%%sqt%%s battles with its opponents are examples of both persistence and%%lst%% to a marked degree%%lst%% apparent over%%dsh%%optimism%%per%% 
397 Mr Stokes demonstrated a tendency both in his actions ]^[ evidence to see the commercial world%%lst%% particularly the propriety of his competitors%%sqt%% conduct%%lst%% in rather black ]^[ white terms%%per%% 
(This trait has ]n[ proved an insuperable obstacle to Seven itself switching allegiances%%lst%% as shown by its alliance with Ten in bidding ]f[ the AFL broadcasting rights in 2005%%per%% 
) A rather Manichaean view of the commercial world may ]v[ may ]n[ explain Mr Stokes%%sqt%% propensity to engage in litigation (a propensity of which the Respondents sought to make much%%lst%% although it hardly seems to be unique in the television industry)%%per%%]$~ 
~$[But it may help to explain how he could believe that particular discussions ]v[ events occurred%%lst%% ]v[ that certain beliefs were expressed ]v[ opinions held%%lst%% when the objective evidence strongly suggests otherwise%%per%%]$~ 
~$[A firm grasp of the facts%%lst%% in the lawyer%%sqt%%s sense%%lst%% is evidently ]n[ a prerequisite to business success%%per%% 
398 In summary%%lst%% I cannot accept Mr Stokes as a reliable witness on matters that are in dispute%%lst%% especially where there is contemporaneous documentation ]v[ cogent oral evidence that conflicts with his account%%per%% 
5%%per%%2%%per%%2 Mr Gammell 
399 Mr Gammell is an accountant by training%%per%%]$~ 
~$[He came to Australia in 1981 ]^[ worked ]f[ a company controlled by Mr Stokes%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Gammell returned to Scotland in 1984%%lst%% ]b[ after five years came back to Australia to take up a position as General Manager of ACE%%lst%% Mr Stokes%%sqt%% private company%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Later Mr Gammell assumed the title of Group Managing Director of ACE ]^[ has continued in that position ever since%%per%% 
400 Mr Gammell became an alternate to Mr Stokes as a director of Seven Network in 1995 ]^[ a non%%dsh%%executive director in 1998%%per%%]$~ 
~$[There has clearly been a very close working relationship over the years between Mr Stokes ]^[ Mr Gammell%%per%%]$~ 
~$[This relationship continued throughout the period relevant to this case%%lst%% except ]f[ three months from early July 1998%%lst%% when Mr Gammell was overseas%%per%% 
401 Like Mr Stokes%%lst%% Mr Gammell generally appeared unruffled in the witness box%%lst%% notwithstanding that his credibility was repeatedly challenged%%per%%]$~ 
~$[He%%lst%% too%%lst%% displayed considerable self%%dsh%%control during his evidence%%per%% 
402 Mr Gammell made a number of concessions readily enough%%per%%]$~ 
~$[For example%%lst%% Mr Gammell acknowledged that he had told Ms Lowes of Telstra that Seven%%sqt%%s attempts to secure retail access ]f[ C7 via the Telstra Cable was a pressure tactic to get C7 onto the Foxtel platform%%lst%% although he gave contradictory evidence as to whether he had admitted to Ms Lowes that C7 was ]n[ in truth looking ]f[ retail access via the Telstra Cable%%per%%]$~ 
~$[He agreed that his conversation with Mr Falloon on 4 November 1999%%lst%% in which Mr Falloon said %%sqt%% hell will freeze over %%sqt%% before C7 got onto Foxtel%%lst%% had taken place in the context of a discussion about C7%%sqt%%s application ]f[ a right of access to the Telstra Cable%%lst%% rather %%cmp_ta%% in relation to C7%%sqt%%s attempts to gain wholesale access to the Foxtel Service%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Gammell also accepted that he had framed a particular bid ]f[ the NRL pay television rights with the express purpose of creating division within the NRL PEC ]^[ that Seven%%sqt%%s bid ]f[ the NRL pay television rights was designed in part to %%sqt%% ramp %%sqt%% the price that News ]v[ Fox Sports would have to pay ]f[ the rights%%per%% 
403 Despite these concessions%%lst%% I formed the view that Mr Gammell%%sqt%%s evidence was sometimes unreliable%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Difficulties with his account became apparent when he claimed that over a period of four months from November 1998 he did nothing to follow up the state of negotiations ]f[ the supply of C7 to Austar ]^[ Foxtel%%per%%]$~ 
~$[I have taken into account that Mr Gammell was out of Australia on several occasions between November 1998 ]^[ March 1999 ]^[ that there were other matters to occupy his time%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Even so%%lst%% I find his evidence that he did nothing to ascertain the position in relation to Austar ]^[ Foxtel implausible%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Among other things%%lst%% Mr Gammell met with Mr Mounter at least twice during this period (once in London)%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Gammell had every opportunity to make inquiries on issues in which he evidently had a close interest%%per%% 
404 Similarly%%lst%% I found implausible Mr Gammell%%sqt%%s evidence that he had remonstrated with Mr Mounter before the board meetings of 26 March 1999 ]^[ 28 May 1999%%lst%% about the latter%%sqt%%s approach to the negotiations with Austar ]^[ Foxtel%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Gammell agreed that he did ]n[ raise the issue at either board meeting%%per%%]$~ 
~$[His apparent reticence is very hard to accept%%lst%% given that he regarded Mr Mounter%%sqt%%s conduct as threatening the very viability of C7 ]^[ that%%lst%% by the time of the second board meeting%%lst%% Mr Gammell thought that Mr Mounter%%sqt%%s continued tenure as CEO was untenable%%per%% 
405 My reservations about the reliability of Mr Gammell%%sqt%%s evidence are reinforced by his claim that he had understood a reference in Mr Mounter%%sqt%%s CEO%%sqt%%s report of 16 June 1999 to %%sqt%% $4%%dsh%%$5 a sub %%sqt%% as meaning that Mr Mounter was negotiating with Foxtel to pay C7 a fee of $4%%per%%00 to $5%%per%%00 pspm on basic ]v[ as %%cmp_if%% on basic%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Gammell had earlier conceded that he knew that Mr Mounter was %%sqt%% sticking to his guns %%sqt%% %%dsh%%%%dsh%%%%dsh%% that is%%lst%% negotiating with Foxtel ]f[ the supply of C7 on a tier%%lst%% ]n[ on basic%%per%%]$~ 
~$[My reservations are compounded by the fact that the documentation relating to Mr Mounter%%sqt%%s departure from Seven in July 1999 makes no reference to his stance on the negotiations ]f[ the sale of C7 to Austar ]^[ Foxtel%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Gammell%%sqt%%s explanation ]f[ ]y[ another apparently significant omission I found to be unconvincing%%per%% 
406 Other aspects of Mr Gammell%%sqt%%s evidence were equally unsatisfactory%%per%%]$~ 
~$[For example%%lst%% he claimed to have instructed Mr Wise in July 2000 to correct a draft budget to remove a revenue figure based on $2%%per%%00 pspm ]f[ C7 on a tier on Foxtel%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Yet no correction was ever made to replace that figure with the figure that Mr Gammell said he regarded as appropriate%%lst%% namely $4%%per%%00 to $5%%per%%00 pspm on basic (which would have increased revenue by perhaps $30 million per annum)%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Gammell had a motive ]f[ dissociating himself from the negotiations with Foxtel ]f[ the placement of C7 on a tier%%lst%% namely to bolster Seven%%sqt%%s damages claim%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In my opinion%%lst%% that motive coloured his evidence%%per%% 
407 My overall impression is that Mr Gammell%%sqt%%s evidence is something of a mixture of frankness ]^[ unreliability%%per%%]$~ 
~$[I think that parts of his account have been strongly influenced%%lst%% unconsciously ]v[ otherwise%%lst%% by his perception of the case Seven seeks to advance%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It is %%cmp_tf%% necessary to approach his evidence on contested issues with caution%%lst%% especially where it is unsupported by ]v[ inconsistent with contemporaneous documentation ]v[ other reliable evidence%%per%% 
5%%per%%2%%per%%3 Mr Wise 
408 A good deal of Mr Wise%%sqt%%s evidence was given in a straightforward manner%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Early in his evidence%%lst%% in particular%%lst%% Mr Wise presented as a careful ]^[ generally quite precise witness%%per%%]$~ 
~$[While his memory of some events was imperfect%%lst%% the gaps in his recollection during that portion of his evidence were no more %%cmp_ta%% might be expected of a witness asked to remember conversations ]v[ dealings that took place years earlier%%per%% 
409 As Mr Wise%%sqt%%s cross%%dsh%%examination continued%%lst%% however%%lst%% his evidence became less convincing in a number of respects%%per%%]$~ 
~$[For example%%lst%% after being pressed ]f[ some time%%lst%% Mr Wise conceded that letters he sent to the AFL on 20 ]^[ 22 November 2000 had been carefully crafted following discussions with Mr Stokes ]^[ Mr Gammell%%lst%% in terms that were misleading%%per%%]$~ 
~$[He %%cmp_t%% disputed the proposition that the AFL had in fact been misled%%lst%% giving reasons that I found difficult to understand and%%lst%% in any event%%lst%% unpersuasive%%per%% 
410 Shortly after this evidence%%lst%% Mr Wise gave an equally unpersuasive explanation as to what he had meant by suggesting that Mr Stokes tell the AFL that Seven had received no credit ]f[ having %%sqt%% suffocated %%sqt%% soccer by ]n[ showing it on free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air television%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Wise%%sqt%%s explanation of what he intended to convey in his %%sqt%% dummy bid %%sqt%% email of 24 November 2000 to Mr Gammell was also somewhat confused and%%lst%% at least insofar as Mr Wise denied any knowledge that Seven intended to %%sqt%% ramp %%sqt%% News in relation to the NRL rights%%lst%% was ]n[ at all persuasive%%per%% 
411 There were other occasions on which Mr Wise was reluctant to admit the obvious ]v[ on which his evidence was simply self%%dsh%%contradictory%%per%%]$~ 
~$[An example of the former was his reluctance to acknowledge that he appreciated that Seven%%sqt%%s public campaign against SingTel would be likely to damage SingTel%%sqt%%s reputation%%per%%]$~ 
~$[An example of the latter was Mr Wise%%sqt%%s apparently unequivocal evidence that%%lst%% at the end of 2000%%lst%% his understanding was that negotiations between Seven ]^[ Foxtel ]f[ the carriage of C7 had ceased with Seven%%sqt%%s offer of 17 November 1999%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Wise later claimed that he had performed certain calculations in December 2000 by reference to negotiations ]f[ the carriage of C7 on Foxtel%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Those negotiations had taken place in November 2000 between Mr Stokes ]^[ Mr Blomfield%%per%%]$~ 
~$[His attempt to reconcile the two pieces of evidence did ]n[ succeed%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In addition%%lst%% Mr Wise%%lst%% like Mr Stokes%%lst%% was forced from time to time to disavow the accuracy of contemporaneous records in order to support his version of what had taken place%%per%% 
412 In my view%%lst%% some of Mr Wise%%sqt%%s evidence was coloured by his perception of where Seven%%sqt%%s interests lay in the proceedings%%per%%]$~ 
~$[I have %%cmp_tf%% found it necessary to approach carefully Mr Wise%%sqt%%s evidence on certain contested issues%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Care is especially warranted when Mr Wise%%sqt%%s evidence is difficult to reconcile with contemporaneous documentation ]^[ lacks internal consistency%%per%%

413 Seven%%sqt%%s criticism of Mr Macourt%%sqt%%s credibility are relatively mild%%lst%% certainly when %%cmp%%d with its attack on the veracity of Mr Philip%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Seven%%sqt%%s Closing Submissions argue that I should %%sqt%% treat Mr Macourt%%sqt%%s evidence with reserve in some respects %%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The particular criticisms made by Seven are that he had a tendency to engage in advocacy ]^[ that some of the explanations he gave ]f[ particular conduct did ]n[ withstand scrutiny%%per%%]$~ 
~$[For example%%lst%% Seven says that Mr Macourt%%sqt%%s evidence as to his reasons ]f[ refusing to allow the C7 channels to be taken by Foxtel fell away in cross%%dsh%%examination%%per%%

~$[Mr Philip reported to him%%per%%]$~ 
~$[As Mr Sumption acknowledged in his oral closing submissions%%lst%% in order ]f[ Seven to make out its case that News ]^[ Foxtel%%sqt%%s objective was to destroy C7%%lst%% it is necessary to reject Mr Macourt%%sqt%%s evidence to the contrary%%per%% 
415 For the most part%%lst%% Mr Macourt answered questions in a straightforward manner%%per%%]$~ 
~$[He quite often gave his evidence in an emphatic ]^[ convincing fashion%%lst%% particularly when disagreeing with propositions put to him by Mr Sumption%%per%%]$~ 
~$[I think it is significant that Mr Macourt gave what seemed to me frank answers to questions that were clearly intended to elicit material unfavourable to the Respondents%%sqt%% interests%%per%%]$~ 
~$[For example%%lst%% he readily accepted that between 1998 ]^[ 2002 he would have preferred C7 to go out of business%%per%%]$~ 
~$[He agreed that in 1998 he had every intention of preventing C7 being taken by Foxtel (although he did ]n[ accept the motives suggested to him by Mr Sumption)%%per%% 
416 Mr Macourt also candidly admitted to some matters that do ]n[ necessarily do him credit%%per%%]$~ 
~$[He said%%lst%% ]f[ example%%lst%% that he would ]n[ have informed Telstra in December 2000 that C7%%sqt%%s offer ]f[ the NRL pay television rights was likely to %%sqt%% disappear %%sqt%%%%lst%% even though that was his view at the time%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Similarly%%lst%% Mr Macourt acknowledged that he would ]n[ necessarily have contradicted Mr Philip in a face to face meeting with Telstra%%lst%% even %%cmp_if%% Mr Philip was putting propositions that Mr Macourt did ]n[ consider to be correct%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Macourt also acknowledged that he had authorised supply arrangements involving Fox Sports without informing Telstra in advance%%lst%% %%cmp_b%% he did ]n[ want Telstra to prevent the arrangements being implemented%%per%% 
(News subsequently expressed its regret ]f[ the lack of consultation%%lst%% ]b[ attributed it to%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%[a] context where Telstra was taking a completely unrealistic ]^[ uncooperative approach to the supply of programming by Fox Sports%%sqt%%%%per%% 
) 
417 Despite the apparent frankness of many of his responses%%lst%% I formed the impression that from time to time in his evidence Mr Macourt acted as something of an advocate ]f[ News%%sqt%% interests%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Macourt certainly had a very good grasp of the legal issues in the case ]^[ was astute to discern the direction his cross%%dsh%%examination was taking%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Perhaps ]f[ this reason there were a few occasions when I thought that he was rather too quick to claim that he had no recollection of particular events%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In making that observation%%lst%% I take into account that Mr Macourt%%sqt%%s recall of events that occurred years before was plainly ]n[ as precise as%%lst%% ]f[ example%%lst%% that of Mr Mockridge%%per%% 
418 There were also occasions when Mr Macourt was forced to acknowledge that he had overstated the position in his written statements%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It is fair to say that some of the reasons Mr Macourt gave in his written statements ]f[ refusing to allow Foxtel to take C7 he found difficult to sustain in the witness box%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In my view%%lst%% however%%lst%% his evidence that he was unwilling to allow Foxtel to take the C7 channels until the dispute with Telstra concerning the pricing of Fox Sports had been resolved%%lst%% withstood cross%%dsh%%examination%%per%% 
419 My overall general impression is that Mr Macourt%%sqt%%s evidence was given truthfully ]^[ with reasonable care%%lst%% even though he saw himself as an advocate ]f[ News%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Nonetheless%%lst%% there are some aspects of his evidence that warrant close scrutiny in the light of the contemporaneous documentation ]^[ the objective circumstances%%per%%]$~

~$[The fax only came to light %%cmp_b%% at least one recipient did ]n[ comply with the request%%per%% 
423 Mr Philip was ]n[ the architect of News%%sqt%% policy of deleting the central record of emails after three days%%lst%% ]b[ he was an enthusiastic proponent of deleting all emails from his own computer after 14 days%%per%%]$~

%%sqt%%somebody might read your e%%dsh%%mails ]^[ draw adverse conclusions about you ]v[ News %%per%%%%per%%%%per%% from them%%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[He took pains to recommend that Mr Macourt produce a detailed electronic record of a meeting between Mr Macourt ]^[ Mr Gammell on 4 December 2000 ]^[ to assist in compiling the record%%lst%% ]y[ made sure that Mr Macourt%%sqt%%s original handwritten notes were destroyed%%per%%]$~ 
~$[I did ]n[ find convincing Mr Philip%%sqt%%s attempts to explain why he had taken that course%%per%% 
424 When confronted in cross%%dsh%%examination with his own admissions as to his dishonest conduct (which Mr Philip had disclosed in a statement filed in the course of the trial)%%lst%% Mr Philip%%sqt%%s responses conveyed the impression that up to that point he had ]n[ fully grasped the magnitude of what he had done%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Be that as it may%%lst%% the evidence shows that at the time Mr Philip went into the witness box%%lst%% News had taken no action either to terminate his employment ]v[ to discipline him%%per%%]$~ 
~$[A possible%%lst%% although unlikely%%lst%% explanation ]f[ this lack of action is that News had ]n[ had sufficient time to act on Mr Philip%%sqt%%s admitted dishonesty%%per%%]$~ 
~$[If it remains the case that News has taken no disciplinary action against Mr Philip%%lst%% it would reflect very seriously indeed on News%%sqt%% standards of commercial morality%%per%%

~$[I propose to request the Registrar of the Court to forward a copy of this judgment to the Law Society of New South Wales ]f[ its consideration and%%lst%% %%cmp_if%% necessary%%lst%% referral to the appropriate bodies%%per%% 
426 As I observe in Chapter 19%%lst%% Mr Philip%%sqt%%s admissions of dishonesty do ]n[ necessarily mean that his evidence was untruthful in all or%%lst%% indeed%%lst%% in any respects%%per%%]$~ 
~$[However%%lst%% there are some parts of his evidence that I do ]n[ accept%%per%%]$~ 
~$[For example%%lst%% as I explain in Chapter 19 ([2984]ff)%%lst%% I reject Mr Philip%%sqt%%s evidence that he did ]n[ deliberately disclose information to Mr Akhurst of Telstra concerning C7%%sqt%%s bid ]f[ the NRL pay television rights%%per%%]$~ 
~$[His evidence on that issue was confused%%lst%% implausible ]^[ singularly unsatisfactory%%per%% 
427 I found other parts of Mr Philip%%sqt%%s evidence difficult to accept%%per%%]$~ 
~$[For example%%lst%% he denied contemplating that C7 had a real chance of acquiring the NRL pay television rights %%cmp_b%% he intended to urge the NRL PEC to accept the Fox Sports offer regardless of the merits of C7%%sqt%%s offer ]^[ he expected the other members of the NRL PEC to follow suit%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Yet on 13 December 2000%%lst%% during a period of frenetic action in relation to the AFL ]^[ NRL pay television rights%%lst%% Mr Philip found time to create a draft call option to be exercised by Foxtel Management against C7 %%cmp_if%% the latter secured the NRL pay television rights%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Philip professed ]n[ to remember why he created the document at such a late stage%%lst%% a disclaimer that did ]n[ ring true%%lst%% particularly as he told the teleconference of 13 December 2000 that there was a serious risk that C7 might acquire the NRL pay television rights%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The document created by Mr Philip does ]n[ necessarily mean that his evidence about his voting intentions was untrue%%per%%]$~ 
~$[But I do ]n[ think he was being frank with the Court in professing ]n[ to remember why he had created it%%per%% 
428 Mr Philip was willing to go to considerable lengths to present a picture that bore little relationship to reality%%per%%]$~ 
~$[As Seven submits%%lst%% his efforts to maintain the fiction that there was no consortium bidding ]f[ the AFL pay television rights reflected the extremely wishful thinking of a lawyer seeking to present an artificial (and false) picture of the facts%%lst%% rather %%cmp_ta%% the true position%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Philip also seemed to me to downplay the extent to which he was involved in commercial decision%%dsh%%making by News ]v[ by the entities of which he was a director%%per%% 
429 In assessing Mr Philip%%sqt%%s evidence%%lst%% it is appropriate to take into account that%%lst%% apart from hard copy documents retained in his own files ]v[ copies of electronic ]v[ paper communications retained by others%%lst%% he deleted the records of his emails%%per%%]$~ 
~$[He did so%%lst%% in part%%lst%% %%cmp_b%% he appreciated that communications of this kind might be useful in litigation%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Seven has been denied the opportunity to cross%%dsh%%examine Mr Philip by reference to the deleted material%%per%% 
430 For these reasons%%lst%% I do ]n[ regard Mr Philip as a reliable witness%%per%%]$~ 
~$[His evidence %%cmp_tf%% needs to be scrutinised carefully%%lst%% including his claims as to his thought processes in relation to particular decisions%%lst%% negotiations ]v[ communications%%per%% 
431 This caution does ]n[ lead me to conclude that I should reject all of Mr Philip%%sqt%%s evidence%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Sometimes it is supported by the contemporaneous documentation ]v[ by other witnesses whose evidence I consider to be reliable%%per%%]$~ 
~$[For example%%lst%% I think it likely that Mr Philip deferred to Mr Macourt in the manner he described%%per%%]$~ 
~$[I also think it likely that Mr Philip was told ]^[ accepted that News%%sqt%% position%%lst%% ]f[ sound commercial reasons%%lst%% was that C7 should ]n[ be taken on Foxtel until the long%%dsh%%term contractual arrangements between Fox Sports ]^[ Foxtel had been secured%%per%%]$~

5%%per%%4 Foxtel%%sqt%%s Witnesses 
5%%per%%4%%per%%1 Mr Mockridge 
432 Mr Mockridge presented as an astute%%lst%% precise witness%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Unlike some witnesses%%lst%% Mr Mockridge had taken considerable trouble to re%%dsh%%familiarise himself with the contemporary documentation bearing on his evidence%%per%%]$~ 
~$[He thus seemed to be well%%dsh%%prepared ]f[ his time in the witness box%%per%% 
433 Seven accepts that Mr Mockridge%%sqt%%s %%sqt%% evidence as to factual matters is generally reliable %%sqt%%%%lst%% ]b[ submits his evidence should nonetheless be treated with some reserve%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Seven argues that Mr Mockridge had a tendency to exaggerate ]v[ frame his evidence in a way that assisted News%%per%% 
434 Mr Mockridge was ]n[ a reticent witness%%per%%]$~ 
~$[He did ]n[ hesitate to request clarification of the cross%%dsh%%examiner%%sqt%%s questions%%lst%% nor to correct what he regarded as erroneous assumptions underlying questions%%per%%]$~ 
~$[An example is the following exchange%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%Your judgment was that %%cmp_if%% Telstra was given Foxtel management%%sqt%%s evaluation of the financial implications of carrying C7%%lst%% it would no longer accept [as] the excuse ]f[ ]n[ carrying C7 that the Fox Sports deal remained outstanding? 
%%dsh%%%%dsh%%%%dsh%% To answer that question in the negative%%lst%% I%%sqt%%ll have to accept your statement that it was an excuse%%lst%% ]^[ it wasn%%sqt%%t an excuse%%per%%]$~ 
~$[But the essence of the question is no%%sqt%%%%per%% 
435 I formed the impression that Mr Mockridge was very alert to the competition issues in the case%%lst%% notwithstanding his protest at one point that he was %%sqt%% at a loss to understand what the critical issues are in this case %%sqt%% ]^[ that he could ]n[ %%sqt%% make head nor tail of it %%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[I also gained the impression%%lst%% as Seven suggests%%lst%% that he saw himself as something as an advocate ]f[ Foxtel in these proceedings%%per%%]$~ 
~$[This stance was consistent with his frank acknowledgement that he had seen his role as CEO of Foxtel as in part that of an advocate%%lst%% ]f[ example to allay the ACCC%%sqt%%s concerns about merger proposals%%per%% 
436 For these reasons%%lst%% Mr Mockridge%%sqt%%s evidence sometimes had a marked advocate%%sqt%%s flourish%%lst%% as illustrated by the following exchange%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%And you understood during the period you were CEO that the risk of an intervention by the ACCC was reduced %%cmp_if%% it were accepted that free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air television ]^[ pay TV were in the same market%%scn%% isn%%sqt%%t that right? 
%%dsh%%%%dsh%%%%dsh%% I think %%cmp_if%% %%dsh%%%%dsh%%%%dsh%% I would state it more strongly%%per%%]$~ 
~$[If the reality of pay TV ]^[ free TV being in the same market is accepted %%lst%% there is no grounds ]f[ the ACCC intervention%%per%% 
%%per%%%%per%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[And you understood it to be very much in Foxtel%%sqt%%s interest to have either this court ]v[ the ACCC adopt the position from which Foxtel was an advocate? 
%%dsh%%%%dsh%%%%dsh%% I understood it [to be] in Foxtel%%sqt%%s interest ]f[ the reality of the marketplace to be accepted by the regulator%%lst%% yes%%sqt%%%%per%% 
(Emphasis added%%per%% 
) 
Similarly%%lst%% when asked why the small number of subscribers who could choose between Foxtel on satellite ]^[ Optus on cable might select the former (notwithstanding that its charges were higher)%%lst%% Mr Mockridge said the reason was %%sqt%% unambiguously the quality of the Foxtel service %%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[At another point he underplayed the conflict in the Telstra%%dsh%%News relationship in the first half of 1999%%per%%]$~ 
~$[He acknowledged that there had been %%sqt%% differences of view %%sqt%% ]b[ insisted%%lst%% ]n[ very persuasively%%lst%% that %%sqt%% broadly this was a successful relationship %%sqt%%%%per%% 
437 It is necessary to bear these matters in mind when assessing Mr Mockridge%%sqt%%s evidence%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Nonetheless%%lst%% I consider him to be generally a reliable witness%%lst%% whose account of events was mostly consistent with the contemporaneous documentation ]^[ who showed a good recall of significant events%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Generally speaking%%lst%% he was prepared to make concessions where appropriate%%per%%]$~ 
~$[There were several occasions when I found Mr Mockridge%%sqt%%s version of events to be ]n[ entirely convincing%%lst%% ]b[ overall I thought that his evidence was given truthfully ]^[ with some care%%per%% 
5%%per%%5 Telstra%%sqt%%s Witnesses 
5%%per%%5%%per%%1 Dr Switkowski 
438 Seven%%sqt%%s position in relation to Dr Switkowski%%sqt%%s evidence is somewhat curious%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Sheahan certainly challenged Dr Switkowski%%sqt%%s credibility in cross%%dsh%%examination%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Specifically%%lst%% as Mr Sheahan explained in dealing with objections to certain questions%%lst%% he sought to contradict Dr Switkowski%%sqt%%s denial that he (Dr Switkowski) had known in 2000 that the purpose of News ]^[ PBL was to %%sqt%% kill C7 %%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Sheahan also sought to contradict Dr Switkowski%%sqt%%s evidence that he was ]n[ conscious that the transactions to which he committed Telstra on 13 December 2000 would have the effect of destroying C7 as a viable business%%per%% 
439 To that end%%lst%% Mr Sheahan suggested to Dr Switkowski in cross%%dsh%%examination that Telstra had a powerful motive to forego any scruples about the fate of C7 when it came to securing the cooperation of the other Foxtel partners in expanding the scope of Foxtel%%sqt%%s business%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Dr Switkowski agreed that he supported the idea of an expansion of Foxtel%%sqt%%s activities in certain respects%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The thrust of the questioning was that such an expansion%%lst%% which required the support of both News ]^[ PBL%%lst%% would %%sqt%% unlock %%sqt%% value in Foxtel%%lst%% to the advantage of Telstra as a 50 per cent partner in the business%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The assumption underlying the questioning appeared to be that Dr Switkowski was prepared to sacrifice Foxtel%%sqt%%s immediate commercial interests (by paying too much ]f[ the AFL pay television rights)%%lst%% in order to gain rewards from a more valuable Foxtel business further down the track%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In addition%%lst%% Mr Sheahan asked a number of questions that went only to Dr Switkowski%%sqt%%s credit%%lst%% although the answers did ]n[ cause me to doubt the reliability of Dr Switkowski%%sqt%%s evidence%%per%% 
440 In addition to these matters%%lst%% Mr Sheahan put directly to Dr Switkowski that he had formed the view in about September 1999 that the goal of News ]^[ PBL%%lst%% in refusing to allow C7 access to the Foxtel platform%%lst%% was %%sqt%% to run C7 out of business %%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Dr Switkowski denied that he had formed such a view%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Sheahan also questioned Dr Switkowski about a conversation he had with Mr Stokes at a dinner meeting which took place on 31 May 2000%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Dr Switkowski accepted that Mr Stokes may have said (as he claimed) that both Seven ]^[ C7 would be brought down %%cmp_if%% they lost the AFL pay television rights%%per%%]$~ 
~$[However%%lst%% Dr Switkowski said in evidence that he interpreted Mr Stokes as dramatising the importance of Seven acquiring the AFL broadcasting rights ]^[ as warning Telstra off Seven%%sqt%%s %%sqt%% territory %%sqt%%%%per%% 
441 Despite the challenges to Dr Switkowski%%sqt%%s credit in cross%%dsh%%examination%%lst%% Seven%%sqt%%s written submissions%%lst%% as I have noted%%lst%% make only limited criticisms of his evidence%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Indeed%%lst%% the submissions concede that Dr Switkowski%%sqt%%s denials that he had been told by his executives that News ]^[ PBL wished to kill C7 %%sqt%% probably have the ring of truth %%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In addition%%lst%% in its written Reply Submissions%%lst%% Seven invites me to prefer Mr Stokes%%sqt%% account of his conversation with Dr Switkowski on 31 May 2000%%lst%% insofar as reference was made in that conversation to a loss of the AFL broadcasting rights being likely to bring C7 down%%per%% 
443 As I have noted%%lst%% Mr Sumption confirmed in his closing oral submissions that Seven makes no challenge to Dr Switkowski%%sqt%%s credit ]^[ that it does ]n[ suggest that he was deliberately untruthful in his evidence%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Instead%%lst%% Mr Sumption submitted that Dr Switkowski %%sqt%% had forgotten a great deal of the material that he once knew in 2000 %%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[According to Mr Sumption%%lst%% Dr Switkowski had come into the transaction involving the AFL broadcasting ]^[ NRL pay television rights at a late stage (%%sqt%% from a great height %%sqt%%) ]^[ it would %%cmp_tf%% ]n[ be surprising %%cmp_if%% he had forgotten his state of mind at the time%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The evidence%%lst%% ]s[ he argued%%lst%% is enough to justify finding that Dr Switkowski%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%was well aware that the likely consequence of the acquisition of AFL rights was the demise of C7%%lst%% ]v[ at any rate its demise as an entity which could seriously challenge the competitive position of Fox Sports%%lst%% ]^[ I ask you to find that was a matter from which he must have inferred that bringing about that result was part of the purpose of News%%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[A finding to this effect would require me to reject Dr Switkowski%%sqt%%s explicit evidence to the contrary%%per%% 
444 Clearly enough%%lst%% Dr Switkowski%%sqt%%s recollection of the events about which he gave evidence was far from perfect%%per%%]$~ 
~$[He readily accepted in cross%%dsh%%examination that he did ]n[ remember certain matters about which he was asked%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It is also true%%lst%% as Dr Switkowski himself pointed out%%lst%% that he was primarily concerned about strategic issues arising in his management of an extremely large telecommunications company worth%%lst%% in 2000%%lst%% some $70%%dsh%%$80 billion%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Questions concerning Telstra%%sqt%%s role in pay television%%lst%% ]f[ the most part%%lst%% were ]n[ at the forefront of his mind%%lst%% despite his membership of the pay television sub%%dsh%%committee of the board%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Nonetheless%%lst%% in my view%%lst%% Dr Switkowski generally demonstrated a surprisingly good recall of the events in which he was involved ]^[ of the issues requiring decisions to be made at the time%%per%%]$~ 
~$[On more %%cmp_ta%% one occasion%%lst%% his recollection%%lst%% unaided by reference to documents%%lst%% turned out to be supported by the contemporaneous materials%%per%% 
445 It is also significant that Dr Switkowski%%sqt%%s attention was drawn to the AFL broadcasting rights well before the critical teleconference of 13 December 2000%%per%%]$~ 
~$[For example%%lst%% earlier in 2000%%lst%% Dr Switkowski attended meetings ]^[ made decisions about %%sqt%% Project Chess %%sqt%%%%lst%% a plan that contemplated that Telstra itself would bid ]f[ ]^[ acquire the AFL broadcasting rights ]f[ 2002 to 2006%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Dr Switkowski met with Mr Stokes on 31 May 2000 ]^[ had been briefed in preparation ]f[ that meeting%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In late October ]^[ early November 2000%%lst%% he had discussions with Mr Chisholm ]^[ others about Foxtel%%sqt%%s possible acquisition of the AFL pay television rights%%per%%]$~ 
~$[He was well aware of the strategic issues arising from the relationship between Telstra ]^[ the other Foxtel partners%%per%% 
446 Once Seven accepts that Dr Switkowski%%sqt%%s credit is ]n[ in issue%%lst%% I have little hesitation in accepting his evidence that he was ]n[ aware that the likely consequence of the acquisition of the AFL broadcasting rights by News ]^[ the sub%%dsh%%licensing of the AFL pay television rights to Foxtel would be the demise of C7 ]v[ its demise as an entity capable of seriously challenging Fox Sports%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Given Dr Switkowski%%sqt%%s good recall of other matters ]^[ the significance of the transaction to which he was committing Telstra (even though it was relatively modest by Telstra%%sqt%%s standards)%%lst%% I do ]n[ accept Seven%%sqt%%s submission that in the witness box he simply forgot his state of mind at the time%%per%% 
447 For completeness%%lst%% I should add that I accept that Dr Switkowski held the views he expressed in his evidence about Mr Stokes%%sqt%% litigious propensities%%lst%% notwithstanding his willingness to do business with Mr Stokes ]v[ Seven on a number of occasions%%per%%]$~ 
~$[I see no inconsistency between Dr Switkowski%%sqt%%s evidence ]^[ his actions%%lst%% given the need ]f[ Telstra ]^[ Optus (on the one hand) ]^[ Seven (on the other) to cooperate on certain matters%%lst%% such as advertising%%per%% 
448 The fact that several passages in the statements of Dr Switkowski ]^[ Mr Akhurst are identical possibly may reflect on Telstra%%sqt%%s legal advisers%%lst%% ]b[ I do ]n[ think that%%lst%% of itself%%lst%% it affects the reliability of the evidence in those statements%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Finally%%lst%% the relatively minor differences in the recollection of Dr Switkowski ]^[ Mr Stokes as to the content of their discussions on 31 May 2000 are no more %%cmp_ta%% might be expected from participants to a conversation that took place many years earlier%%per%% 
5%%per%%5%%per%%2 Mr Akhurst 
449 Mr Akhurst%%lst%% before taking up a position as General Counsel at Telstra%%lst%% was a partner in a large law firm%%lst%% Mallesons Stephen Jaques%%lst%% specialising in competition law ]^[ general commercial matters%%per%%]$~ 
~$[His involvement in the issues concerning Telstra ]^[ Foxtel became greater from about July ]v[ August 1999%%lst%% although the process was gradual%%per%% 
450 Mr Akhurst did ]n[ seem to have examined the extensive contemporary documentation in depth before giving his evidence%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Leaving aside matters in which his involvement was peripheral%%lst%% this meant that his recollection of some events ]^[ communications was vague and%%lst%% in certain respects%%lst%% inaccurate%%per%%]$~ 
~$[As I have already remarked%%lst%% this of itself is no more %%cmp_ta%% is to be expected when a witness is asked about matters occurring at least five years earlier%%lst%% particularly when%%lst%% in this case%%lst%% Mr Akhurst had no particular reason to pay close attention to some of the documents to which he was taken in cross%%dsh%%examination%%per%% 
451 Nonetheless%%lst%% I formed the view that there were occasions when Mr Akhurst was inclined to take refuge in being unable to remember matters that he preferred ]n[ to address directly%%per%%]$~ 
~$[For example%%lst%% Mr Akhurst said that he could ]n[ recall that%%lst%% after receiving a June 2000 memorandum from Telstra%%sqt%%s Legal Regulatory Department%%lst%% he appreciated that Seven%%sqt%%s public position was that C7%%sqt%%s business would be in jeopardy %%cmp_if%% it did ]n[ secure the AFL pay television rights%%per%%]$~ 
~$[I think Mr Akhurst must have appreciated at the time that this was Seven%%sqt%%s position ]^[ that the probability is that he realised that in the witness box%%per%% 
452 Another example is Mr Akhurst%%sqt%%s inability to recall being told by Mr Fogarty (on 31 October 2000) that Foxtel had indicated that acquiring the AFL pay television rights %%sqt%% will negate C7 %%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Even when shown the email%%lst%% he maintained that he may have skimmed over it ]^[ thus could ]n[ remember it%%per%%]$~ 
~$[I think it is likely that Mr Akhurst appreciated at about this time that %%cmp_if%% Seven failed to acquire the AFL pay television rights%%lst%% the consequences ]f[ C7 might be very serious%%per%%]$~ 
~$[By this time%%lst%% Mr Akhurst appreciated (as he accepted in evidence) that %%cmp_if%% Seven lost the AFL pay television rights Optus ]^[ Austar would be entitled to terminate their content supply agreements with C7%%per%% 
453 Because of my concerns about aspects of Mr Akhurst%%sqt%%s testimony%%lst%% I have scrutinised carefully his evidence on the central issues%%lst%% especially his reasons ]f[ Telstra giving support to the bids by News ]^[ Fox Sports ]f[ the AFL broadcasting ]^[ NRL pay television rights%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Nonetheless%%lst%% I think that the substance of his evidence on these issues should be accepted%%per%%]$~ 
~$[I reach this conclusion in part %%cmp_b%% Mr Akhurst%%sqt%%s account was consistent with contemporaneous documentation%%per%%]$~ 
~$[For example%%lst%% Mr Akhurst%%sqt%%s evidence that he was influenced by Mr Chisholm%%sqt%%s view that Foxtel should acquire the AFL pay television rights from the AFL%%lst%% is supported by contemporaneous documentation showing that Mr Chisholm indeed expressed that view%%per%%]$~ 
~$[An email of 20 November 2000 from Mr Akhurst to Dr Switkowski supports Mr Akhurst%%sqt%%s evidence that he did ]n[ think that Telstra%%sqt%%s support ]f[ Foxtel acquiring the AFL pay television rights involved anti%%dsh%%competitive conduct%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Akhurst was told by Mr Philip in written communications that there was a sound commercial justification ]f[ each of the bids to be made by News (supported by Foxtel) ]^[ by Fox Sports%%per%%]$~ 
~$[I have also taken into account that Mr Akhurst%%sqt%%s evidence was consistent with that of Dr Switkowski%%lst%% whose evidence I accept as reliable%%per%% 
454 Mr Akhurst was cross%%dsh%%examined on his explanation ]f[ deciding to lend Telstra%%sqt%%s in%%dsh%%principle support to the Foxtel Put (at a fee of $17%%per%%5 million per annum) at Foxtel%%sqt%%s board meeting of 9 November 2000%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The cross%%dsh%%examination demonstrated that Mr Akhurst might well have made further inquiries to verify what he had been told about the merits of the proposal ]^[ to probe further Mr Fogarty%%sqt%%s assessment of the possible consequences of concentrating the AFL ]^[ NRL sports rights in the hands of News ]^[ Fox Sports%%per%%]$~ 
~$[I also think it probable that Mr Akhurst%%lst%% although he was reluctant to acknowledge it%%lst%% appreciated that there was a real risk that %%cmp_if%% C7 lost the AFL pay television rights it might ]n[ be able to survive as a supplier of sports channels%%per%% 
455 I do ]n[ think%%lst%% however%%lst%% that the cross%%dsh%%examination established that Mr Akhurst formed the view that the objective of News%%lst%% PBL ]v[ Telstra in seeking the AFL pay television rights was to kill C7 ]v[ otherwise severely harm it as a supplier of sports channels%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Appreciating that there was a risk that the loss of the AFL pay television rights might threaten C7%%sqt%%s survival is very different from understanding that this was a substantial objective sought by News ]v[ PBL in bidding ]f[ the AFL pay television rights%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The risk was an incident%%lst%% as Mr Akhurst saw matters%%lst%% of the ordinary processes of competition ]f[ the AFL pay television rights%%per%% 
456 Much less do I think that the cross%%dsh%%examination established that Mr Akhurst thought that Telstra should support any such objective%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Akhurst considered that there were valid commercial reasons ]f[ Telstra to agree to the Foxtel Put ]^[ ]f[ Foxtel to acquire the AFL pay television rights%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In particular%%lst%% he considered that the rights would drive Foxtel%%sqt%%s subscriber growth ]^[ benefit the business generally%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In reaching this conclusion%%lst%% I have ]n[ overlooked that Mr Willis had expressed the view in early November 2000 that C7 stood between a sports monopoly ]^[ some competition%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Akhurst said%%lst%% ]^[ I accept%%lst%% that he was sceptical of the proposition that Fox Sports would be able to extract monopoly profits%%per%% 
457 Nor did the cross%%dsh%%examination establish that Mr Akhurst%%sqt%%s state of mind in relation to these matters changed materially between 9 November 2000 ]^[ 13 December 2000%%lst%% when the teleconference took place%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The course of events at the teleconference ]^[ Dr Switkowski%%sqt%%s evidence support Mr Akhurst%%sqt%%s denial that he allied himself with any objective of News%%lst%% PBL ]v[ Foxtel to kill C7%%per%%

5%%per%%7 Rule in Jones v Dunkel 
465 Both Seven ]^[ the Respondents rely on the so%%dsh%%called rule in Jones v Dunkel to support their respective cases%%per%%]$~ 
~$[There was no dispute as to the principles to apply%%lst%% although there were strong disagreements as to the significance of the principles in the circumstances of this case%%per%% 
466 In Jones v Dunkel%%lst%% Menzies J said (101 CLR%%lst%% at 312) that a direction should have been given to the jury in a civil trial that made three things clear%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%(i) that the absence of the defendant %%per%%%%per%%%%per%% as a witness cannot be used to make up any deficiency of evidence%%scn%% (ii) that evidence which might have been contradicted by the defendant can be accepted the more readily %%cmp_if%% the defendant fails to give evidence%%scn%% (iii) that where an inference is open from facts proved by direct evidence ]^[ the question is whether it should be drawn%%lst%% the circumstance that the defendant disputing it might have proved the contrary had he chosen to give evidence is properly to be taken into account as a circumstance in favour of drawing the inference%%sqt%%%%per%% 
467 Windeyer J observed (at 321%%lst%% citing Wigmore on Evidence (3rd ed%%lst%% Little Brown Co%%lst%% 1940) vol 2%%lst%% at 162)%%lst%% that it was %%sqt%% plain commonsense %%sqt%% that%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%The failure to bring before the tribunal some circumstance%%lst%% document%%lst%% ]v[ witness%%lst%% when either the party himself ]v[ his opponent claims that the facts would thereby be elucidated%%lst%% serves to indicate%%lst%% as the most natural inference%%lst%% that the party fears to do so%%lst%% ]^[ this fear is some evidence that the circumstance ]v[ document ]v[ witness%%lst%% %%cmp_if%% brought%%lst%% would have exposed facts unfavourable to the party%%per%%]$~ 
~$[These inferences%%lst%% to be sure%%lst%% cannot fairly be made except upon certain conditions%%scn%% ]^[ they are also open always to explanation by circumstances which made some other hypothesis a more natural one %%cmp_ta%% the party%%sqt%%s fear of exposure%%per%%]$~ 
~$[But the propriety of such an inference in general is ]n[ doubted%%sqt%%%%per%% 
468 Windeyer J also said (at 320%%dsh%%321) that%%lst%% unless a party%%sqt%%s failure to give evidence be explained%%lst%% %%sqt%% it may lead rationally to an inference that his evidence would ]n[ help his case %%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[This proposition extends to a potential witness in the party%%sqt%%s camp%%per%%]$~ 
~$[A potential witness is normally regarded as within the camp of a particular party %%cmp_if%% it would be natural ]f[ that party to call the witness%%lst%% ]v[ %%cmp_if%% the party could reasonably be expected to call the witness%%cln%% RPS v The Queen [2000] HCA 3 %%scn%% (2000) 199 CLR 620%%lst%% at 632 [26]%%lst%% per Gaudron ACJ%%lst%% Gummow%%lst%% Kirby ]^[ Hayne JJ%%scn%% O%%sqt%%Donnell v Reichard [1975] VR 916%%lst%% at 929%%lst%% per Newton ]^[ Norris JJ%%per%%

470 The unexplained failure by a party to call witnesses may %%lst%% ]n[ must%%lst%% in appropriate circumstances lead to an inference that the uncalled evidence would ]n[ have assisted that party%%sqt%%s case%%cln%% Cross on Evidence (7 th Aust ed%%lst%% LexisNexis Butterworths%%lst%% 2004)%%lst%% at [1215] (e)%%lst%% citing Jones v Dunkel 101 CLR%%lst%% at 308%%lst%% per Kitto J%%scn%% at 312%%lst%% per Menzies J%%scn%% at 320%%dsh%%321%%lst%% per Windeyer J%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Moreover%%lst%% although the trier of fact may draw that inference%%lst%% it is ]n[ appropriate to infer that the absent witness%%sqt%% evidence would have exposed facts unfavourable to the case of the party failing to call the witness%%cln%% Brandi v Mingot (1976) 12 ALR 551%%lst%% at 559%%lst%% per Gibbs ACJ%%lst%% Stephen%%lst%% Mason ]^[ Aickin JJ%%per%%

~$[In the latter case%%lst%% Newton ]^[ Norris JJ said ([1975] VR%%lst%% at 929) that where a Jones v Dunkel inference is available%%lst%% it may be taken into account against the party in question ]f[ two purposes%%lst%% namely%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%(a) in deciding whether to accept any particular evidence%%lst%% which has in fact been given%%lst%% either ]f[ ]v[ against that party%%lst%% ]^[ which relates to a matter with respect to which the person ]n[ called as a witness could have spoken%%scn%% ]^[ 
(b) in deciding whether to draw inferences of fact%%lst%% which are open to them upon evidence which has been given%%lst%% again in relation to matters with respect to which the person ]n[ called as a witness could have spoken%%sqt%%%%per%% 
472 It follows from these principles that the rule in Jones v Dunkel cannot be employed to fill in gaps in the evidence ]v[ to convert conjecture ]^[ suspicion into inference%%cln%% Cross on Evidence (7th Aust ed)%%lst%% at [1215] n 244%%scn%% West v Government Insurance Office [1981] HCA 38 %%scn%% (1981) 148 CLR 62%%lst%% at 69%%lst%% per Stephen%%lst%% Mason%%lst%% Aickin ]^[ Wilson JJ%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Moreover%%lst%% %%cmp_if%% a party chooses without explanation ]n[ to give evidence%%lst%% the rule in Jones v Dunkel does ]n[ require the court to refrain from drawing any inferences in that party%%sqt%%s favour%%per%%]$~ 
~$[As Hill J said in Flack v Chairperson%%lst%% National Crime Authority (1997) 80 FCR 137%%lst%% at 149%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%It may well be the case that where two inferences are equally open one favourable ]^[ one unfavourable%%lst%% ]^[ the evidence of the witness might confirm one inference%%lst%% that the failure of that witness to give evidence would lead to the conclusion that the other inference should be drawn%%per%%]$~ 
~$[That may follow from the proposition that it can be assumed that the evidence of the witness who fails to give evidence would ]n[ support the witness%%sqt%% case%%per%%]$~ 
~$[But except in a case where the inferences are equally open%%lst%% each case will involve the Court weighing up all the relevant evidence to determine whether an inference should be drawn%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Put another way%%lst%% I do ]n[ think that Jones v Dunkel will ever lead to the conclusion that where there are competing inferences one inference will%%lst%% in all cases%%lst%% of necessity have to be accepted by the Court where the inference to be drawn does ]n[ depend upon evidence which the non%%dsh%%participating witness might give%%lst%% ]v[ even where it might%%lst%% %%cmp_if%% other evidence justifies the drawing of the inference%%sqt%%%%per%%

474 Seven devotes a chapter in its Closing Submissions to the rule in Jones v Dunkel%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In that chapter%%lst%% Seven submits that inferences adverse to one ]v[ more Respondents can be drawn from the failure to call no less %%cmp_ta%% 25 potential witnesses%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The potential witnesses identified by Seven include very senior executives%%lst%% such as Mr Lachlan Murdoch%%lst%% the CEO of News at relevant times%%scn%% Mr Blomfield%%lst%% the CEO of Foxtel Management until December 2001%%scn%% Mr James Packer%%lst%% Chairman of PBL%%scn%% ]^[ Mr Mansfield%%lst%% the Chairman of Telstra%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The list also includes less senior personnel%%lst%% ]v[ those who were more peripheral to the relevant events%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Potential witnesses within these categories include Mr Greg Willis%%lst%% a director of Telstra Media ]^[ Foxtel Management%%scn%% Mr Brenton Willis%%lst%% a Project Manager with Telstra Media%%scn%% Mr Dalgliesh%%lst%% Director%%lst%% Marketing of Optus%%sqt%% CMM division%%scn%% ]^[ various officers of NRL Ltd ]^[ ARL%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Had all the potential witnesses identified by Seven been called%%lst%% the case would have run ]f[ at least another 30 ]v[ ]s[ hearing days%%per%% 
475 I am ]n[ entirely sure of the purpose of Seven%%sqt%%s submissions on this topic%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Seven appears to submit that%%lst%% as a general proposition%%lst%% inferences adverse to the various Respondents should be drawn from the failure to call witnesses within their respective camps%%per%%]$~ 
~$[For example%%lst%% Seven says that%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%the Court should draw inferences from the fact that [News] failed to call Mr [Lachlan] Murdoch%%lst%% who was %%per%%%%per%%%%per%% a key decision%%dsh%%maker in the events at the heart of the proceeding%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The attempts made by Mr Macourt%%lst%% ]^[ to a lesser extent Mr Philip%%lst%% to distance Mr Murdoch from these events should ]n[ be accepted%%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Seven points out that Mr Murdoch was engaged in certain negotiations ]^[ attended certain significant meetings%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The submissions do not%%lst%% however%%lst%% at least at this point%%lst%% identify the factual questions in respect of which inferences adverse to News should be drawn by reason of its failure to call Mr Murdoch%%per%% 
476 Similarly%%lst%% Seven submits that Mr James Packer was %%sqt%% actively involved in all relevant facets of the case pleaded by [Seven] %%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Seven points out%%lst%% ]f[ example%%lst%% that Mr Packer participated in the teleconference of 13 December 2000 ]^[ held a meeting with Mr Lachlan Murdoch%%lst%% Mr Chisholm of Telstra ]^[ Mr Chris Anderson of Optus ]^[ which opened the way to the Foxtel%%dsh%%Optus CSA%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Seven invites me to find that Mr Packer was as involved as Mr Murdoch in the relevant events%%per%%]$~ 
~$[However%%lst%% its submissions do ]n[ explain precisely which inferences adverse to PBL should be drawn from Mr Packer%%sqt%%s unexplained absence from the witness box%%per%% 
477 If the point of these submissions is simply to establish that Mr Murdoch ]^[ Mr Packer should be regarded as within News%%sqt%% ]^[ PBL%%sqt%%s camps respectively%%lst%% ]f[ the purposes of the rule in Jones v Dunkel%%lst%% I have no difficulty with that proposition%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It seems to me clear that each should be ]s[ regarded%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The critical question is %%cmp_t%% whether News%%sqt%% failure to call Mr Murdoch%%lst%% ]v[ PBL%%sqt%%s failure to call Mr Packer%%lst%% justifies drawing an inference against those parties ]^[ in favour of Seven on particular factual issues%%per%%]$~ 
~$[As the authorities show%%lst%% whether such inferences should be drawn will depend on the nature of the factual issues raised by the pleadings%%lst%% the totality of the evidence relating to those issues ]^[ the extent to which the evidence of Mr Murdoch ]v[ Mr Packer might reasonably be thought to elucidate the matters in dispute%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The significance of the unexplained absence of any potential witness from the witness box cannot be determined in the abstract%%per%% 
478 This is ]n[ to deny that it may be necessary%%lst%% when considering the inferences that should be drawn in relation to specific factual questions%%lst%% to take into account that one ]v[ other of the Respondents has ]n[ called a potential witness from their camp who could have been expected to explain ]v[ contradict something%%per%%]$~ 
~$[An example is Mr Stokes%%sqt%% account of a meeting with Mr James Packer%%lst%% said to have taken place on the weekend of 9 ]^[ 10 December 2000%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Clearly%%lst%% Mr Packer could have been expected to give evidence contradicting Mr Stokes%%sqt%% account %%cmp_if%% that account was inaccurate%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Packer did ]n[ do so%%per%% 
479 A second example is Foxtel%%sqt%%s failure to call Mr Blomfield to give evidence about his conversations with Mr Fogarty of Telstra in late October ]v[ early November 2000 in which he said words to the effect that the acquisition of the AFL pay television rights was %%sqt%% about killing C7 %%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Contrary to News%%sqt%% submissions%%lst%% I find that Mr Blomfield was in News%%sqt%% camp at the time the hearing took place notwithstanding the circumstances in which his employment was terminated%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Clearly he could have given evidence explaining his comments%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Blomfield%%sqt%%s unexplained absence from the witness box is %%cmp_tf%% a factor (but only one factor) to be taken into account in determining the significance of his comments%%per%% 
480 Contrary%%lst%% however%%lst%% to the tenor of some of Seven%%sqt%%s submissions%%lst%% the unexplained failure to call Mr Packer ]v[ Mr Blomfield does ]n[ require me to accept the evidence of Mr Stokes ]v[ to infer from Mr Blomfield%%sqt%%s comments that Foxtel (or some of the Foxtel partners) had the objective of killing C7%%per%%]$~ 
~$[These factual issues must be determined in the light of the totality of the evidence%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In the result%%lst%% I do ]n[ accept the substance of Mr Stokes%%sqt%% account of his conversation with Mr Packer%%lst%% despite PBL%%sqt%%s failure to call Mr Packer%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Similarly%%lst%% although I give some weight to Mr Blomfield%%sqt%%s comments%%lst%% I do ]n[ regard them as decisive ]v[ compelling on the question of whether I should infer that Foxtel had the purpose of killing C7 that Seven attributes to it%%per%% 
481 It must also be borne in mind that although Mr Murdoch ]^[ Mr Packer (and other potential witnesses identified by Seven) may have participated in significant conversations%%lst%% this does ]n[ mean that there is any real dispute as to what occurred%%per%%]$~ 
~$[For example%%lst%% Ms Lowes of Telstra prepared a detailed file note of a conversation between Mr Murdoch ]^[ Mr Blount (CEO of Telstra) on 17 December 1998%%lst%% the accuracy of which there is no reason to doubt%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Similarly%%lst%% there is no real dispute as to the substance of what was said at the teleconference of 13 December 2000%%lst%% at which the Master Agreement was made%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In any event%%lst%% four witnesses who had attended the teleconference gave evidence%%cln%% Mr Macourt%%lst%% Mr Philip%%lst%% Dr Switkowski ]^[ Mr Akhurst%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In these circumstances%%lst%% there is no room ]f[ the application of Jones v Dunkel in relation to the contents of the discussion%%per%% 
5%%per%%8 Document Deletion Policies

~$[According to Mr Philip%%lst%% email traffic within News is stored on the local computer ]^[ %%sqt%% synchronised %%sqt%% to a central disk storage%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Between 1998 ]^[ 2002%%lst%% the practice was to delete the material stored centrally after a period of three days%%lst%% by overwriting the back%%dsh%%up disks%%per%% 
483 The effect of this policy is to delete any record of email traffic%%lst%% both incoming ]^[ outgoing%%lst%% after three days%%lst%% except to the extent that the creator ]v[ recipient of an email chooses to retain it%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The individual may retain a copy of the email%%lst%% either by retaining it on his ]v[ her hard drive%%lst%% ]v[ by printing out the email ]^[ storing it in a paper file%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It appears that News discovered fewer %%cmp_ta%% 50 emails in electronic form%%lst%% although doubtless more would have been discovered as part of paper files%%per%% 
484 Mr Philip claimed that he printed out important emails ]^[ retained them in his files%%per%%]$~ 
~$[However%%lst%% his practice was to delete emails permanently from the hard drive of his computer after about two weeks%%per%%]$~ 
~$[His explanation ]f[ this practice was that he thought it %%sqt%% sensible to be precise about what you retain ]^[ don%%sqt%%t retain %%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Philip agreed with the cross%%dsh%%examiner%%sqt%%s proposition that one reason ]f[ him adopting this practice was%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%so that people will in future know as little as possible from documentary records about what you%%lst%% Mr Philip%%lst%% have been doing%%sqt%%%%per%% 
485 Mr Philip%%sqt%%s actions show that he was perfectly prepared to destroy documents he considered to be detrimental to his interests ]v[ to those of News%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In these circumstances%%lst%% I think the appropriate course is to take an approach analogous to the rule in Jones v Dunkel %%per%%]$~ 
~$[That is%%lst%% %%cmp_if%% the evidence as a whole is consistent with a particular inference relating to Mr Philip%%sqt%%s conduct ]v[ intentions%%lst%% that inference may be easier to draw by reason of the absence of contemporaneous internal News documentation that might have shed light on the true position%%per%% 
486 There is no direct evidence that other officers of News were prepared to destroy documents in the same way as Mr Philip%%per%%]$~ 
~$[However%%lst%% the paucity of News%%sqt%% discovery of emails suggests that internal emails damaging to News%%sqt%% interests would ]n[ come to light unless someone chose to retain a hard copy%%per%%]$~ 
~$[An approach analogous to the rule in Jones v Dunkel might %%cmp_tf%% be appropriate %%cmp_if%% the evidence on a particular point is unclear ]^[ it is likely that internal News emails would shed light on the true position%%per%% 
487 There is no evidence as to PBL%%sqt%%s policy relating to the retention ]v[ deletion of electronic communications%%per%% 
(PBL called no lay witnesses%%per%% 
) However%%lst%% it appears that PBL ]^[ Nine discovered between them only 30 emails ]f[ the period 1998 to 2001%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Of course%%lst%% this surprisingly low number might have been the consequence of practices quite different from those adopted by News%%per%%]$~ 
~$[There is certainly no evidence of the deliberate destruction of unhelpful documents%%per%% 
488 News%%sqt%% document deletion practice raises real issues ]f[ the conduct of litigation of this kind%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Although there has been no suggestion that News%%sqt%% general policy is unlawful%%lst%% Seven has been deprived%%lst%% to some extent%%lst%% of the opportunity to cross%%dsh%%examine News%%sqt%% officers by reference to contemporaneous emails%%per%%]$~ 
~$[I was ]n[ told how many emails were discovered in paper form ]v[ were preserved by recipients outside News%%lst%% ]s[ the precise extent of any disadvantage is hard to assess%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Even so%%lst%% care must be taken to ensure that cynical business practices are ]n[ rewarded by forensic advantages%%per%%

~$[The second is the dispute between News ]^[ Telstra as two of the partners (through Sky Cable ]^[ Telstra Media) in the Foxtel Partnership%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Not all the dealings between Foxtel ]^[ C7 were affected by the partnership dispute ]^[ the dispute between News ]^[ Telstra was by no means confined to the conduct of negotiations between Foxtel ]^[ C7%%per%%]$~ 
~$[On the contrary%%lst%% the dispute between News ]^[ Telstra centred on the proposals ]f[ the long%%dsh%%term supply of Fox Sports to Foxtel%%per%%]$~ 
~$[However%%lst%% the question of whether Foxtel would take C7 and%%lst%% %%cmp_if%% so%%lst%% on what terms was closely related%%lst%% at least from Telstra%%sqt%%s perspective%%lst%% to the principal bone of contention between the parties%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It is ]f[ this reason that it is convenient to consider both matters together%%per%% 
564 The Chapter recounts the course of the News%%dsh%%Telstra disputes until early January 2001%%lst%% immediately after the AFL ]^[ the NRL Partnership had awarded their respective pay television rights%%per%%]$~

565 One element in the dispute between News ]^[ Telstra arose out of arrangements entered into between Fox Sports ]^[ Austar%%per%%]$~ 
~$[After Fox Sports ]^[ Austar had entered into the Fox Sports%%dsh%%Austar Interim Licence of 13 May 1998 ([544])%%lst%% they negotiated ]f[ more permanent arrangements%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In a letter of 6 July 1998%%lst%% Austar%%sqt%%s CEO (Mr Fries) asserted to Mr Macourt that%%lst%% although Austar was very interested in continuing carriage of Fox Sports%%lst%% it could not%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%continue to dedicate nearly 25% of our gross revenue (approximately $10/sub/month) to Fox Sports in its current form%%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Fries also said that%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%[w]ith the Optus/7 Sports deal we have been presented with an attractive alternative ]f[ sports programming ]^[ intend to explore this alternative%%sqt%%%%per%% 
566 In a letter sent on the same day%%lst%% Mr Mann of Austar requested Mr Philip that Austar be permitted to package NRL programming with any other sports programming%%lst%% including %%sqt%%any sports channel created by any rationalisation of sports programming in Australia %%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Philip replied on 24 July 1999%%lst%% that this proposal was unacceptable %%cmp_b%%%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%News has legitimate concerns to prevent the quality perception of the NRL coverage suffering by association with the branding ]^[ programming practices of various sports channels%%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Austar attempted to persuade News to change its mind%%lst%% ]b[ Mr Philip remained firmly opposed to the proposal%%per%% 
567 In the meantime%%lst%% on 8 July 1998%%lst%% Mr Macourt sent a fax to Mr Fries outlining alternative proposals ]f[ Austar to take both Fox Sports channels ]f[ a five year term%%per%%]$~ 
~$[One proposal involved flat fee pricing%%lst%% while the other provided ]f[ a fee on a pspm basis%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The latter proposal contemplated a base price of US$5%%per%%25 pspm (inflation adjusted)%%lst%% with volume discounts reducing the fee to US$3%%per%%00 pspm ]f[ more %%cmp_ta%% 350,000 subscribers in the first year%%per%%]$~

~$[On 30 July 1998%%lst%% Mr Macourt made a revised offer%%lst%% reducing certain of the proposed fees%%per%% 
568 After further negotiations%%lst%% the Fox Sports%%dsh%%Austar CSA was executed on 3 September 1998%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Fox Sports granted Austar the right to retail distribution of the Fox Sports channels (including%%lst%% from 1 January 2001%%lst%% the NRL) in specified territories%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The licence was to expire on 30 June 2006%%lst%% ]b[ Austar could terminate the agreement %%cmp_if%%%%lst%% during the NRL seasons ]f[ 2001 to 2006%%lst%% Fox Sports did ]n[ have the NRL pay television rights%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Austar was ]n[ permitted to sub%%dsh%%license except to Austar entities%%per%% 
569 The Fox Sports%%dsh%%Austar CSA made provision ]f[ a %%sqt%% Base Price %%sqt%% of US$4%%per%%75 pspm ]^[ a %%sqt%% Band A Price %%sqt%% of US$3%%per%%25 pspm%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The Base Price was payable ]f[ the first 250,000 subscribers ]^[ the Band A Price ]f[ subscribers in excess of 250,000%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The price was payable %%sqt%% as %%cmp_if%% on basic %%sqt%%%%cln%% that is%%lst%% by reference to all subscribers ]^[ ]n[ merely to the subscribers to the tier on which Fox Sports was placed%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The Fox Sports%%dsh%%Austar Interim Licence was terminated%%lst%% except to the extent necessary to enable Austar to perform its obligations to Foxtel%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The result was that Foxtel continued to receive Fox Sports programming through Austar%%lst%% with payments remitted to Fox Sports%%per%% 
570 On 3 September 1998%%lst%% News also sub%%dsh%%licensed the NRL pay television rights to Fox Sports ]f[ the territories in which Austar provided services%%per%%]$~

%%sqt%%Whilst Telstra has ]n[ been informed of the non%%dsh%%exclusive deal struck with Austar at US$4%%per%%75 ]f[ satellite ]^[ US$5%%per%%25 ]f[ cable%%lst%% it was imperative to Fox Sports ]^[ FOXTEL that Austar keep taking Fox Sports as its principle [sic] sports service rather %%cmp_ta%% moving to the Optus Vision Channel Seven sports service which it was threatening to do%%per%%]$~

~$[News is of the view that it was free to do the deal with Austar ]b[ had no confidence that Telstra would have permitted FOXTEL to conclude a deal with Austar in time on the back of exclusive supply from Fox Sports to FOXTEL (it was our expectation that Telstra would have happily used Austar%%sqt%%s threats to go to Optus Vision ]^[ Channel Seven to put pressure on Fox Sports to reduce the price of Fox Sports to both FOXTEL ]^[ Austar)%%sqt%%%%per%%

583 As has been noted ([544])%%lst%% on 13 May 1998%%lst%% the Foxtel Partnership received a sub%%dsh%%licence of the Fox Sports channels from Austar on an interim basis%%per%%]$~ 
~$[On 4 June 1998%%lst%% Mr Philip of News%%lst%% %%sqt%% in anticipation of News obtaining control of Fox Sports in the near future %%sqt%%%%lst%% sent to Mr Mockridge of Foxtel Management two alternative proposals ]f[ the long%%dsh%%term supply of the Fox Sports channels to Foxtel%%per%% 
(News in fact exercised its right to acquire Australis%%sqt%% share in Fox Sports on 12 June 1998%%per%% 
) 
584 The first proposal was ]f[ the grant of exclusive rights (subject to certain exceptions including supply to Austar areas)%%lst%% with a right to sub%%dsh%%license%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The suggested price was US$6%%per%%25 pspm%%lst%% with an annual increase of five per cent from 1998 to 2000 ]^[ six per cent from 2000 onwards%%lst%% subject to specified MSGs%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In addition%%lst%% Foxtel was to make an initial payment of $8 million%%lst%% to be set off against subscriber fees ]f[ the last two months of the term%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The second proposal was ]f[ non%%dsh%%exclusive rights at US$5%%per%%25 pspm%%lst%% with an initial payment of US$4 million%%lst%% reduced MSGs ]^[ a volume discount ]f[ 500,000 subscribers ]v[ more%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In each case%%lst%% the proposed term was six years%%lst%% expiring on 30 June 2004%%per%% 
585 Each of the two proposals contained a clause%%lst%% equivalent to that included in Fox Sport%%sqt%%s proposal to Optus%%lst%% which would have prevented Foxtel transmitting any sports programming ]n[ provided by Fox Sports unless the latter agreed%%per%%]$~ 
~$[There were exceptions ]f[ ESPN (on a tier) ]^[ ]f[ AFL programming (provided that Foxtel licensed Fox Sports to supply the programming to Foxtel%%per%%

~$[He acknowledged that%%lst%% having regard to the exceptions in the offer%%lst%% the only party caught by the provision at the time would have been Seven%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Macourt also said that he expected the clauses to be negotiated out%%per%% 
586 On 5 June 1998%%lst%% Ms Lowes reported to Mr Blount that she had discussed with Mr Macourt the fact that Fox Sports was requesting Foxtel to pay higher fees ]f[ sports %%cmp_ta%% under current arrangements%%per%%]$~ 
~$[She had told Mr Macourt that the request was unacceptable to Telstra as it could ]n[ be argued that higher prices were in Foxtel%%sqt%%s interests%%per%% 
587 On 12 June 1998%%lst%% Mr Freudenstein%%lst%% on behalf of Foxtel Management%%lst%% sent Ms Lowes ]^[ Ms Dodd of Telstra a fax%%lst%% of which a copy was sent to Mr Philip ]^[ Mr Macourt%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The fax attached a marked up copy of the arrangement ]f[ the exclusive supply of Fox Sports to Foxtel that had been proposed by Mr Philip%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In substance%%lst%% Foxtel was %%sqt%% prepared to do a deal on broadly the same economic terms as the existing Australis Fox Sports deal %%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Thus it was prepared to pay a base subscriber fee of US$5%%per%%25 pspm ]^[ adjusted MSGs%%per%% 
588 On 16 June 1998%%lst%% Mr Philip forwarded to Mr Freudenstein ]^[ Ms Dodd a document specifying a set of issues that had arisen in relation to the Fox Sports%%dsh%%Foxtel proposal%%per%%]$~ 
~$[He suggested a meeting%%lst%% which apparently took place on 18 June 1998%%per%%]$~ 
~$[A summary of the meeting prepared by Mr Philip recorded that Telstra had argued that a fee of US$6%%per%%25 pspm%%lst%% ]v[ even of US$5%%per%%25 pspm%%lst%% was too high ]^[ that%%lst%% in any event%%lst%% the fee should be set in Australian dollars%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Telstra also objected to other features of the proposal%%lst%% including the %%sqt%% $8 million bond %%sqt%% ]^[ the percentage increases in the licence fees over time%%per%% 
589 On 19 June 1998%%lst%% Mr Philip sent to Mr Mockridge ]^[ Mr Freudenstein of Foxtel Management redrafted exclusive ]^[ non%%dsh%%exclusive terms sheets %%sqt%% indicative of counter offers from you that Fox Sports is likely to find acceptable %%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The non%%dsh%%exclusive term sheet contemplated that Foxtel would be permitted to carry other sports channels (including ]b[ ]n[ limited to AFL programming)%%lst%% provided that they were carried on a tier above that carrying the Fox Sports channels%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Macourt agreed in evidence that the general object of this clause was to prevent other sports suppliers from competing with Fox Sports%%per%%]$~ 
~$[He also said that it was part of an attempt to make Fox Sports the %%sqt%% gate%%dsh%%keeper of sports programming ]f[ Foxtel %%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Macourt further agreed that%%lst%% in view of the exceptions ]f[ ESPN ]^[ Sky Racing %%lst%% the only channel that he anticipated would be affected was C7%%per%% 
590 Ms Lowes of Telstra put her views to Mr Macourt in a fax of 22 June 1998%%per%%]$~ 
~$[She said that she was at a loss to understand the commercial justification ]f[ the %%cmp_t%% current proposal which was %%sqt%% more expensive ]^[ on worse terms %%cmp_ta%% Australis%%sqt%% original deal with Fox Sports %%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Ms Lowes asserted that the terms were neither reasonable nor commercial%%per%%]$~ 
~$[She recognised%%lst%% however%%lst%% the desirability of Foxtel securing long%%dsh%%term sports programming ]^[ suggested as a basis ]f[ discussion certain %%sqt%% price parameters %%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Her suggestion was a base price of US$5%%per%%25 pspm%%lst%% subject to volume discounts above 500,000 subscribers%%per%%]$~ 
~$[She rejected the proposal that Foxtel should pay an $8 million bond%%per%% 
591 On 28 June 1998%%lst%% Mr Mockridge sent a memorandum to Ms Lowes attaching financial models relating to the proposal ]f[ the long%%dsh%%term supply of Fox Sports to Foxtel%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The proposal at this stage contemplated a price of US$5%%per%%25 pspm ]f[ the Fox Sports channels until October 1998%%lst%% increasing five per cent annually until 2000 ]^[ thereafter by six per cent per annum%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Foxtel would receive a reduced price of US$4%%per%%00 pspm above a specified subscriber level ]^[ there would be no MSG%%per%% 
592 On 1 July 1998%%lst%% Mr Mockridge sent a term sheet prepared by Mr Freudenstein to Mr Macourt ]^[ Ms Lowes which was said to reflect earlier discussions%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In his covering note%%lst%% Mr Mockridge expressed the view that%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%the proposal of a starting price [is] consistent with the old Australis deal ]b[ by including volume discounts %%cmp_if%% we reach subscribers in excess of 90% of our business plan projection ]f[ FOXTEL/Austar combined is no worse (and possibly better) ]f[ FOXTEL %%cmp_ta%% the old Australis deal%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It is %%cmp_tf%% consistent with my initial view that a deal around the old Australis position was %%dqt%%fair%%dqt%% to both shareholders given the significant benefits to both shareholders delivered via the termination of the TNC Heads%%sqt%%%%per%%

7%%per%%7 News%%sqt%% Financial Models%%cln%% Mid%%dsh%%1998 
594 In May ]^[ June 1998%%lst%% Mr Macourt of News asked ]f[ a series of financial models to be prepared in order to assess the financial impact of the Fox Sports channels being supplied to Optus ]^[ Austar%%per%%]$~ 
~$[One such model%%lst%% prepared by Mr Parker in about late May 1998%%lst%% showed that carriage of Fox Sports on all three pay platforms over a 10 year period%%lst%% on the basis of the assumptions recorded in the model%%lst%% produced a net present value (%%sqt%% NPV %%sqt%%) of $1%%per%%038 billion%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Carriage on both Foxtel (but no satellite coverage) ]^[ on Austar produced an NPV of $88%%per%%9 million%%lst%% while carriage on the Foxtel platform alone (no satellite coverage) produced an NPV of %%dsh%%$171%%per%%2 million%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Macourt accepted in his evidence that the models suggested to him at the time that there was a very considerable financial difference between the situation where the Fox Sports channels were carried on Foxtel alone ]^[ where they were carried on Foxtel%%lst%% Optus ]^[ Austar%%per%% 
595 Other modelling performed by Mr Parker at Mr Macourt%%sqt%%s request at about this time was prepared on alternative assumptions as to the inflation rate applied to rights expenses ]^[ outside production costs depending on the %%sqt%% competitive environment %%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The inflation rate was assumed to be five per cent when there was no %%sqt%% alternative sports programmer %%sqt%% ]^[ eight per cent when there was such a programmer%%per%% 
(The rate of general inflation was assumed to be 3%%per%%5 per cent%%per%% 
) According to Fox Sports 2000 Budget Operating Plan%%lst%% rights fees ]^[ delivery represented 66 per cent of total expenses%%lst%% while production costs amounted to 24 per cent of total expenses%%per%% 
596 On about 17 June 1998%%lst%% a further 10 year model was prepared within News under Mr Parker%%sqt%%s supervision in order to take account of amendments provided by Mr Macourt ]^[ Mr Lachlan Murdoch during a business plan meeting%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The model preserved the distinction between rights inflation of eight per cent ]f[ exclusive supply of Fox Sports to Foxtel ]^[ Austar only (that is%%lst%% where there was an alternative sports programmer) ]^[ rights inflation of five per cent ]f[ non%%dsh%%exclusive supply to all three platforms (that is%%lst%% where there was no alternative sports programmer)%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The assumptions recorded in the model indicate that News was contemplating that AFL might be shown on a tier%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The model estimated that exclusive supply produced an NPV of %%dsh%%$23%%per%%4 million%%lst%% %%cmp%%d with an NPV of $100%%per%%9 million ]f[ non%%dsh%%exclusive supply%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The major reasons ]f[ the different outcomes were%%lst%% as Mr Macourt explained%%lst%% extra revenue from Optus subscribers ]^[ reduced rights fees payable on the non%%dsh%%exclusive model%%per%% 
597 Mr Macourt agreed in evidence that the reason ]f[ differentiating between the situation where there was ]^[ was ]n[ competition in the sports channel business was that %%cmp_if%% Fox Sports was the only sports channel supplier%%lst%% %%sqt%% it would be able to drive a harder bargain with sports bodies who sell rights %%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Macourt also agreed that it was important to News%%lst%% Fox Sports ]^[ Foxtel to hold down the cost of sports rights ]^[ that the most likely source of competition to Fox Sports %%sqt%% in the sports channel business %%sqt%%%%lst%% following the demise ]v[ likely demise of SportsVision%%lst%% was C7%%per%% 
7%%per%%8 C7%%sqt%%s First Proposal to Foxtel%%cln%% 7 June 1998 
598 Seven first put a proposal to provide a sports channel to Foxtel at a meeting which took place on about 7 June 1998 at the Quay Apartments in Sydney%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The participants were Messrs Macourt%%lst%% Mockridge%%lst%% Stokes ]^[ Gammell%%per%% 
599 Mr Macourt%%sqt%%s evidence was that the price asked by Seven was %%sqt%% far too expensive %%sqt%% ]^[ %%sqt%% clearly unacceptable %%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[He said that he was also concerned that the offer had no guarantee of quality%%lst%% although he acknowledged that the sports channel had ]n[ ]y[ commenced broadcasting ]^[ it was open to Foxtel to negotiate guarantees as to quality%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Macourt further said that he did ]n[ wish Foxtel to take a %%sqt%% rival branded sports service %%sqt%% until the relationship between Fox Sports ]^[ Foxtel was resolved%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%I had this concern principally %%cmp_b%% I perceived that Telstra might seek to utilise an agreement with another sports channel as a basis ]f[ excluding Fox Sports ]v[ renegotiating the price at which FOXTEL took Fox Sports to a level which would seriously undermine Fox Sports%%sqt%% capacity to supply quality sports programming to FOXTEL%%per%%]$~ 
~$[I considered either result as inimical to the interests both of Fox Sports ]^[ FOXTEL%%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Macourt accepted that one reason he rejected Seven%%sqt%%s proposal was that as a matter of principle he was ]n[ willing to let Foxtel carry a channel of a company that he regarded as a competitive threat%%per%%]$~ 
~$[However%%lst%% he maintained that %%cmp_if%% the channel had been cheap enough he would have accepted it on Foxtel%%per%% 
600 Mr Mockridge was more emphatic in his evidence%%per%%]$~ 
~$[He said that he regarded Seven%%sqt%%s proposed price as %%sqt%% excessive ]^[ ]n[ %%per%%%%per%%%%per%% a genuine commercial offer %%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Indeed%%lst%% in his cross%%dsh%%examination Mr Mockridge asserted that the term sheet was %%sqt%% ]s[ crazy ]^[ lacked such detail %%sqt%% that it conveyed that Seven was ]n[ prepared to deal%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Mockridge said that %%cmp_b%% he did ]n[ regard the proposition as serious%%lst%% he did ]n[ carry the negotiations further%%per%%]$~ 
~$[This was despite holding the view (as he acknowledged) that it was desirable%%lst%% in principle%%lst%% ]f[ Foxtel to carry AFL content%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Gammell confirmed Mr Mockridge%%sqt%%s evidence to the extent that he recalled Mr Mockridge making it clear at the meeting of 7 June 1998 that the proposed price ]f[ C7 was unacceptable%%per%% 
601 Mr Gammell%%sqt%%s evidence was that he regarded Seven%%sqt%%s offer as reasonable%%per%%]$~ 
~$[However%%lst%% he formed that view largely %%cmp_b%% he believed that Foxtel was paying Fox Sports in the range of $12%%per%%00 pspm%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Although Mr Gammell ultimately learned the true position (that is%%lst%% that Foxtel was paying US$5%%per%%25 pspm)%%lst%% he apparently continued to believe that Foxtel paid $12%%per%%00 pspm%%lst%% at least until April 1999%%per%%

~$[During this period%%lst%% Mr Wood took charge of C7%%lst%% initially under direction of Mr Bateman%%per%%]$~ 
~$[At the Seven Network board meeting of 31 July 1998%%lst%% Mr Wood presented a preliminary business plan%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The plan assumed that C7%%sqt%%s channels would be supplied to Foxtel ]^[ Austar%%lst%% as well as to Optus%%lst%% ]^[ that it would be supplied on a tier at $4%%per%%00 pspm (inflation adjusted)%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The business plan estimated costs in the first year at $30%%per%%97 million%%lst%% increasing to $55%%per%%71 million in 2008/2009%%per%%]$~ 
~$[This reduction in estimated costs ]f[ the first year (from $40 million in earlier plans) reflected Mr Gammell%%sqt%%s view in consultation with Mr Bateman that costs should be reduced%%per%% 
604 The board approved the business plan in principle%%per%%]$~ 
~$[However%%lst%% Mr Wood was requested to prepare a revised business plan ]^[ a budget %%sqt%% which included a profit %%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Stokes accepted in evidence that the move from a cost base of $40 million to $31 million in the first year meant that the channel would have a %%sqt%% different character %%sqt%%%%per%% 
605 Mr Wood presented a revised budget ]f[ C7 at the Seven Network board meeting of 28 August 1998%%per%%]$~ 
~$[This showed EBIT (earnings before interest ]^[ tax) of $2%%per%%2 million on net revenue of $30%%per%%5 million ]^[ costs of $30%%per%%5 million%%lst%% allowing $2%%per%%2 million ]f[ %%sqt%% FTA rights recovery %%sqt%%%%per%%]$~

606 In a letter of 23 July 1998%%lst%% Mr Macourt%%lst%% on the instructions of Mr Lachlan Murdoch%%lst%% asked Mr Moriarty of Telstra to consider financial models ]f[ various rights acquisitions from Fox Sports%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Macourt described the three models as follows%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%Model 1 represents the exclusive offer to Foxtel provided to you in June%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Model 2 represents the non%%dsh%%exclusive offer provided on the same date%%per%%]$~

~$[Model 3 represents the non%%dsh%%exclusive offer to Foxtel with Foxtel sub%%dsh%%licensing to both Optus ]^[ Austar%%sqt%%%%per%% 
607 Mr Macourt observed in his letter that%%lst%% on the basis of %%cmp_t%% current events%%lst%% Model 3 appeared to be an unlikely outcome%%per%%]$~ 
~$[He concluded as follows%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%I regard the recent events with Optus ]^[ Seven Sports as a significant opportunity ]f[ both Fox Sports ]^[ Foxtel%%per%%]$~ 
~$[As you are aware News Limited has been very aggressive in obtaining rights ]f[ Foxtel including Rugby League%%lst%% Rugby Union Super 12 ]^[ more recently international cricket ]^[ Premier League Soccer%%per%%]$~

608 Mr Macourt%%sqt%%s letter was followed%%lst%% on 27 July 1998%%lst%% by a letter from Mr Lachlan Murdoch to Mr Blount%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Murdoch said it was worth noting that%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%(a) the exclusive offer was priced higher %%cmp_ta%% the non%%dsh%%exclusive offer %%cmp_b%%%%lst%% under it%%lst%% Fox Sports%%sqt%% profitability would depend entirely on FOXTEL%%sqt%%s efforts to sublicence the programming%%scn%%

(c) the cost of sports programming is increasing substantially %%per%%%%per%%%%per%% the suppliers of sports programming treat television as their primary revenue source%%lst%% ]^[ seek top dollar ]f[ all subscription driving sports programming%%scn%%

(e) News ]^[ Fox Sports have put an enormous effort into having the best sports programming available ]f[ FOXTEL %%per%%%%per%%%%per%%%%sqt%%

%%sqt%%I also hoped that the non%%dsh%%exclusive offer would facilitate Fox Sports%%sqt%% ability to pull Optus away from Seven%%lst%% ]^[ in ]s[ doing%%lst%% break Optus%%sqt%% exclusivity in AFL programming%%per%%]$~ 
~$[I want Fox Sports to continue to build its business as a premium sports distributor%%per%%]$~

~$[The lawyers said that this was ]n[ a good idea %%per%%%%per%%%%per%%]$~ ~$[PBL said it was likely to bid ]f[ [free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air] rights %%per%%%%per%%%%per%%%%sqt%% 
There is again no reason to doubt the substantial accuracy of Ms Lowes%%sqt%% summary%%lst%% perhaps allowing ]f[ some literary licence in respect of the tone of voices%%per%% 
681 On 29 March 1999%%lst%% Mr Mockridge made some observations about the C7 proposal in an internal memorandum as follows%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%2%%cln%% The C7 deal means we might have the opportunity to take it prior to 2001%%lst%% ]b[ I don%%sqt%%t see that happening until Fox Sports is sorted out %%per%%]$~ 
~$[However%%lst%% %%cmp_if%% we do%%lst%% that obviously sends the AFL the message that we don%%sqt%%t need the deal to get AFL%%lst%% ]b[ rather we want to deal to improve our coverage of AFL (which is a good position to be in)%%per%% 
3%%cln%% In reality I think Seven%%sqt%%s strategy is to secure all free ]^[ pay rights again ]^[ hope it can multi%%dsh%%channel them%%lst%% meaning C7 might ]n[ be a secure route to getting the rights %%per%% 
4%%cln%% This means we have to put even more effective weight on the key point in the submission%%scn%% that is%%lst%% the AFL should entrust its Pay%%dsh%%TV product to a proper Pay%%dsh%%TV operator ]^[ ]n[ permit a free operator on the defensive to be the gatekeeper %%sqt%%%%per%% 
(Emphasis added%%per%% 
) 
682 Mr Mockridge%%sqt%%s evidence was that he regarded it as desirable that the Fox Sports stand%%dsh%%off be resolved as soon as possible%%lst%% essentially ]f[ two reasons%%per%%]$~ 
~$[First%%lst%% the interim arrangement involved a fixed price of US$5%%per%%25 pspm ]^[ a permanent arrangement would certainly carry a volume discount%%per%%]$~

~$[Mr Mounter%%sqt%%s CEO%%sqt%%s report prepared ]f[ the meeting recorded the following%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%C7 has gone to air in its new form ]^[ has been generally very well received%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Seeing both C7 ]^[ Fox Sports%%lst%% I have to say that the C7 team have done remarkably well with limited resources%%per%%]$~

~$[This forms part of an overall strategy to secure our Australian Football League franchise from 2002%%sqt%%%%per%% 
684 The significance of this board meeting is primarily due to some rather extraordinary evidence given by Mr Stokes%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In his fourth statement%%lst%% Mr Stokes said that he had read Mr Mounter%%sqt%%s report at the time ]^[ recalled that Mr Mounter had told the board meeting that a deal had been negotiated with Austar at $2%%per%%00 pspm%%per%%]$~

685 The minutes of the meeting noted a number of matters arising out of the CEO%%sqt%%s report%%lst%% ]b[ neither the Austar arrangements nor the Foxtel negotiations were mentioned%%per%%]$~ 
~$[While Mr Stokes claimed that his complaint about Austar had been discussed outside the meeting%%lst%% his evidence was that the Foxtel negotiations were discussed inside the meeting ]^[ that he had specifically stated at the meeting that C7 should ]n[ be on a tier with Foxtel (contrary to Mr Mounter%%sqt%%s proposal)%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Yet the minutes contained no record of any such statement by Mr Stokes%%lst%% nor of any discussion of the issue%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Moreover%%lst%% it is difficult to understand why Mr Stokes%%lst%% who is plainly ]n[ a reticent man in business matters%%lst%% was prepared to tackle Mr Mounter at the meeting on the Foxtel issue%%lst%% ]y[ apparently was ]n[ prepared to raise Austar at that forum%%per%%]$~ 
~$[I cannot accept Mr Stokes%%sqt%% evidence as to what transpired at ]v[ shortly after the board meeting%%per%% 
686 Mr Gammell claimed that he had discussed the Austar deal with Mr Mounter before the board meeting ]^[ that he had also told Mr Mounter that he was concerned that negotiations were taking place on the basis that C7 would be placed on a Foxtel tier%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Despite receiving no satisfaction from Mr Mounter%%lst%% Mr Gammell%%sqt%%s evidence was that he raised neither issue at the board meeting%%per%%]$~ 
~$[As I have recorded in Chapter 5%%lst%% I do ]n[ accept Mr Gammell%%sqt%%s account of what occurred before ]v[ at the board meeting%%per%%]$~

7%%per%%26%%per%%1 Final Paper 
723 The Foxtel Management board meeting originally scheduled ]f[ 22 June 1999 was postponed until 8 July 1999%%per%%]$~ 
~$[An %%sqt%% AFL Strategy %%sqt%% paper was distributed to board members shortly before 22 June%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The AFL Strategy paper proposed that the board should note management%%sqt%%s intention to participate in discussions with the AFL Commission with the objective of securing the AFL pay television rights ]f[ 2002 ]^[ following years%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The AFL Strategy paper also proposed that consideration of taking C7 be deferred%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%until it can be more clearly assessed as to what extent a decision to take C7 prior to the termination of Seven%%sqt%%s existing rights deal with the AFL will detract from a bid by FOXTEL ]^[ the other pay%%dsh%%TV operators to secure the rights directly%%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The AFL Strategy paper recorded that the AFL Commission had indicated that it wished to put in place a fresh agreement by the end of 1999%%per%% 
724 The reasons given by management in support of the recommendation were these%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%Given the streng%%cmp_t%%ing in the Fox Sports schedule over the past two years%%lst%% FOXTEL now enjoys a powerful brand leadership over both C7 ]^[ free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air in sport%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Similarly%%lst%% FOXTEL is considered to have better sports coverage %%cmp_ta%% free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air by 51% as against 38%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[However%%lst%% it is clear our one remaining gap is in AFL programming%%per%%]$~ 
~$[FOXTEL management believes that FOXTEL should take the opportunity of the re%%dsh%%negotiation of the AFL rights to seek to acquire AFL rights directly%%per%%]$~ 
~$[If FOXTEL leaves Seven as the %%dqt%%gate%%dsh%%keeper%%dqt%% on AFL rights%%lst%% it is unlikely that the network will ever co%%dsh%%operate by releasing sufficient exclusive live pay%%dsh%%TV games to permit AFL to become a true subscription driver ]f[ pay%%dsh%%TV%%per%%]$~ 
~$[More fundamentally%%lst%% in assessing its medium%%dsh%%term competitive threats%%lst%% FOXTEL must assume that the free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air networks will seek to expand the use of the digital spectrum granted them by the Federal Government from so%%dsh%%called %%dqt%%enhanced%%dqt%% broadcasts to true multi%%dsh%%channelling%%per%%]$~ 
~$[If Seven is left with monopoly control of the AFL product it would %%cmp_t%% be in an excellent position to attack our subscriber base%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It is %%cmp_tf%% important ]f[ FOXTEL to break the pay rights away from the free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air rights ]^[ negotiate directly with the AFL ]f[ the pay%%dsh%%TV rights to this product%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Management is ]n[ recommending a bid ]f[ the free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air rights%%lst%% given the anti%%dsh%%siphoning laws as they currently stand%%sqt%%%%per%% 
725 The final AFL Strategy paper outlined the terms of Seven%%sqt%%s offer to supply C7 to Foxtel ]^[ stated that Foxtel would require tier penetration of 23 per cent in the first year to break even%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The paper identified the quality of C7 as an issue%%lst%% since its non%%dsh%%AFL pay television rights were %%sqt%% weak %%sqt%% ]^[ the AFL product was limited %%cmp%%d with Foxtel%%sqt%%s deal with the NRL%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The paper explained the reasons ]f[ ]n[ pursuing the C7 proposal as follows%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%Clearly an issue with the C7 service is the quality of the channel%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The major rights it holds apart from AFL are weak%%per%% 
%%per%%%%per%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Moreover%%lst%% the AFL product is limited (2 pay%%dsh%%TV games a week) %%per%%%%per%%%%per%% 
%%per%%%%per%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[FOXTEL has stressed its major interest in C7 is its AFL coverage ]^[ this must be maximised%%lst%% including repeats%%lst%% in any service taken by FOXTEL%%per%% 
%%per%%%%per%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It is unclear what impact a decision by FOXTEL to take C7 now would have on our negotiations with the AFL Commission ]v[ the other pay%%dsh%%TV operators%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Certainly%%lst%% Seven would present its non%%dsh%%exclusive supply to all pay%%dsh%%TV platforms as evidence to the AFL that it will be able [to] maximise AFL coverage nationally without doing a direct deal with the pay%%dsh%%TV operators%%per%%]$~ 
~$[For this reason management does ]n[ believe FOXTEL should consider a deal with C7 until we are able to more clearly determine whether a direct deal with the AFL acceptable to FOXTEL is feasible%%sqt%%%%per%% 
726 The AFL Strategy paper set out the key components of a likely deal with the AFL%%per%% 
727 The projected financial impact of the proposed arrangements%%lst%% assuming a tier take%%dsh%%up of 14 per cent ]^[ an additional 100,000 subscribers over five years%%lst%% was as follows%%cln%% 
%%sqt%% Calendar Years 2002 2003 2004

Worst Case (neither Optus nor Austar agree) (12%%per%%5) (2%%per%%1) 0%%per%%4%%sqt%% 
(The figures presumably represent $ millions%%per%% 
) 
728 Mr Macourt annotated his copy of the final AFL Strategy paper ]^[ agreed that he had carefully studied it%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Opposite the observations that Foxtel%%sqt%%s one gap in programming was the AFL ]^[ that Foxtel should seek to acquire the AFL pay television rights directly%%lst%% Mr Macourt noted%%cln%% %%sqt%% Not critical%%per%%]$~ 
~$[May be cheaper to acquire [through] C7 %%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[He also highlighted the worst case scenario projections ]f[ direct acquisition of the rights%%per%% 
729 Mr Macourt%%sqt%%s evidence was that he could ]n[ recall having a concluded view that it was cheaper to acquire C7 %%cmp_ta%% the AFL pay television rights%%per%%]$~ 
~$[He pointed out%%lst%% correctly%%lst%% that he had merely written %%sqt%% may be cheaper %%sqt%%%%per%%]$~

7%%per%%26%%per%%2 Drafts of the Strategy Paper 
730 A number of drafts of the AFL Strategy paper were discovered%%per%%]$~ 
~$[To cover this guarantee%%lst%% FOXTEL would need a penetration rate of less %%cmp_ta%% 9% of its basic subscribers in the first year%%lst%% which is very achievable%%sqt%%%%per%%

7%%per%%26%%per%%3 Mr Mockridge%%sqt%%s Evidence 
733 It appears that none of the Foxtel partners discovered drafts of the AFL Strategy paper%%lst%% although News discovered documents containing recommendations that were included in the final version of the paper%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Mockridge%%sqt%%s evidence was that his staff (including Mr Freudenstein) had prepared the earlier drafts of the AFL Strategy paper ]^[ that he had ]n[ participated in their preparation%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Mockridge said that his own views were reflected in the final version of the AFL Strategy paper%%lst%% ]n[ the drafts%%per%%]$~ 
~$[While he had been willing to negotiate with Seven about the possibility of Foxtel taking C7%%lst%% by June he had formed the view that a decision on C7 should be deferred until Foxtel could assess the extent to which taking C7 would adversely affect a bid by Foxtel to secure the AFL pay television rights directly from the AFL%%per%%]$~ 
~$[At that time (mid%%dsh%%1999)%%lst%% Mr Mockridge believed that the AFL would make a decision about the rights by the end of calendar year 1999 (a belief recorded in the AFL Strategy paper itself)%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Mockridge%%sqt%%s evidence on these issues is consistent with the contemporaneous documentation ]^[ I accept it%%per%% 
734 I also accept Mr Mockridge%%sqt%%s evidence that he had formed the view by early July that it was preferable ]f[ Foxtel to deal directly with the AFL %%cmp_ta%% to take C7 even though Foxtel would bear the risk of sub%%dsh%%licensing Optus ]^[ Austar%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It must be remembered that Mr Mockridge had had discussions with AFL representatives about pay television rights ]f[ some time prior to mid%%dsh%%1999%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It follows that I do ]n[ accept the suggestion made by Seven that the AFL Strategy paper prepared ]f[ the board meeting was merely a stratagem ]v[ subterfuge designed to keep Telstra at bay on the Fox Sports issue%%per%% 
735 In his cross%%dsh%%examination%%lst%% Mr Mockridge explained the reasoning behind his preference that Foxtel Management ]n[ deal with C7 until the bidding ]f[ the AFL pay television rights had played itself out%%cln%%

~$[It was going to be%%lst%% you thought%%lst%% unhelpful in your approach to the AFL %%cmp_b%% it might create the impression in the mind of the AFL that %%cmp_if%% they dealt with C7 they would still have AFL games shown on Foxtel? 
%%dsh%%%%dsh%%%%dsh%% The AFL was dealing with the Seven Network%%lst%% ]n[ C7 as a separate entity%%per%%]$~

~$[It will proceed by supplying FOXTEL with a term sheet indicating what pay television rights the Commission believes it is able to offer%%per%%]$~ 
~$[A difficulty in these discussions is that we understand that Seven enjoys a first ]^[ last right with the AFL ]f[ FTA rights ]^[ the AFL has a %%dqt%%put%%dqt%% option to Seven ]f[ pay rights%%per%%]$~ 
~$[While naturally FOXTEL is unaware of where the boundary is drawn between free ]^[ pay rights%%lst%% Samuel is confident that sufficient rights can be extracted to be attractive to us%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It appears likely this will be in a form where%%lst%% while most weekly games will be available on FTA in at least one city in Australia%%lst%% those same games will be restricted to pay television availability in other cities%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It is also possible the Commission will seek to offer us a simultaneous broadcast right with FTA games%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Samuel has also indicated that the Commission believes it would ]n[ be to its advantage to continue to have both its FTA ]^[ pay television rights held by a FTA operator%%per%%]$~ 
~$[As a consequence%%lst%% even %%cmp_if%% FOXTEL were ]n[ to participate in a bid ]f[ the AFL%%lst%% it is likely that the Commission will seek to find a party other %%cmp_ta%% Seven to distribute the rights%%per%%]$~

%%sqt%%In light of our prior negotiations concerning the Olympics ]^[ C7 Sport%%lst%% the prospects of reaching a commercial agreement with FOXTEL on terms satisfactory to us does ]n[ look promising%%sqt%%%%per%% 
777 Despite this gloomy assessment%%lst%% Mr Wood sent Mr Mockridge on 17 November 1999 a detailed term sheet offering to supply C7 ]^[ the Sydney Olympics to Foxtel%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Wood said that in view of recent discussions%%lst%% Seven was prepared to make %%sqt%% another attempt at a commercial solution %%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The covering letter asked ]f[ a response from Foxtel by 30 November 1999%%per%%]$~

%%sqt%%Our 9 June Heads [of Agreement] set out a price ]f[ a la carte%%lst%% a sport tier ]^[ a general entertainment tier%%per%%]$~ 
~$[As mentioned above%%lst%% you indicated those prices were too high ]b[ you would ]n[ indicate what price would be acceptable%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Given your reluctance to discuss price with us%%lst%% we have looked at our fees again ]^[ focused on offering a price to Foxtel which is a significant discount on the fees you are paying FoxSport [sic] ]f[ the FoxSport channels%%per%%]$~ 
~$[As you will see we have offered a price ]f[ all the channels (including the Olympics) which is a discount on the price Foxtel has paid FoxSport ]f[ the FoxSport channels over the last 12 months together with a simple payment mechanism based on the total number of subscribers to the Foxtel service%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The payment mechanism gives Foxtel the flexibility to place the Channels in whichever Foxtel tier it chooses in order ]f[ Foxtel to optimise its own channel line up%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The fee structure means Foxtel would be paying Seven less %%cmp_ta%% it pays FoxSport%%per%%]$~

~$[Mr Stokes also agreed that %%cmp_if%% Foxtel had accepted Seven%%sqt%%s proposal%%lst%% the fortunes of C7 would have turned around immediately from a slight loss to a situation of massive profitability%%per%%]$~

%%sqt%%The offer ]f[ all of the channels outlined in the Term Sheet would add in excess of $6%%per%%00 per month per subscriber to the cost of FOXTEL%%sqt%%s basic service and%%lst%% with on costs%%lst%% would require FOXTEL to increase the price to subscribers to our basic service by at least $7%%per%%00 per month (a 20% increase on cable)%%per%%]$~ 
~$[We estimate that the NPV cost of this to FOXTEL is in excess of $340 million assuming that the deal expires at the end of the ten year term (which understates the cost to FOXTEL relative to normal practice)%%per%%]$~

809 Mr Akhurst explained in evidence the position as he saw it at the time%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%What I suggest you had in mind at this time was that in order to achieve agreement with News in relation to all the topics surrounding expansion of scope%%lst%% you thought it would be necessary to create an improvement in the partnership relationship?

%%per%%%%per%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[You had in mind that %%cmp_if%% you were to accommodate the interests of News by making compromises on smaller matters%%lst%% that that would improve the partnership relations to such an extent that News might be more accommodating with Telstra on the bigger matters concerning partnership scope ]^[ Foxtel scope of business ]^[ ]s[ on? 
%%dsh%%%%dsh%%%%dsh%% I don%%sqt%%t know that I would have put it exactly like that%%per%%]$~ 
~$[I think %%dsh%%%%dsh%%%%dsh%% 
How would you have put it? 
%%dsh%%%%dsh%%%%dsh%% What I had in mind was that we would sit around the table ]^[ identify what issues were of importance to each of the relevant partners ]^[ discuss what their objectives were in relation to those issues%%lst%% ]^[ %%cmp_t%% see which%%lst%% %%cmp_if%% any%%lst%% of those might be soluble%%per%%]$~

~$[Mr Willis%%sqt%% assessment was as follows%%cln%%

813 The Telstra board noted at the meeting of 19 July 2000 that%%cln%%

~$[In his evidence%%lst%% Dr Switkowski explained Telstra%%sqt%%s change of heart as follows%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%During the early part of 2000%%lst%% the AFL%%lst%% in the positioning of the upcoming rights %%dsh%%%%dsh%%%%dsh%% auction of its broadcast rights%%lst%% was encouraging a number of different combinations of bidders ]^[ in the early months of 2000 the view was %%dsh%%%%dsh%%%%dsh%% ]^[ there were people at Telstra who supported that view %%dsh%%%%dsh%%%%dsh%% that Telstra would bid ]f[ all of the rights%%lst%% ]^[ %%cmp_t%% parcel out various parts of the content to free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air ]^[ pay TV ]^[ other players%%per%%]$~ 
~$[As the year unfolded%%lst%% our conviction that we had the skill set ]v[ even that it was a smart business decision to be the lead bidder ]f[ all of the rights weakened%%per%%]$~

901 At about this time Dr Switkowski had given Mr Akhurst responsibility ]f[ media strategy ]^[ ]f[ dealings with principal media organisations in Australia%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Presumably ]f[ this reason%%lst%% Mr Akhurst telephoned Mr Stokes on 7 June 2000 to advise him that Telstra was ]n[ proposing to bid ]f[ the AFL broadcasting rights%%lst%% ]b[ that Foxtel would probably bid ]f[ the AFL pay television rights%%per%%]$~

~$[He seemed to say that he did ]n[ address the question of whether Foxtel had market power in the context of Foxtel%%sqt%%s apparent refusal to take C7 pending the award of the AFL pay television rights%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Yet Mr Akhurst had had an exchange of emails with Mr de Jong on the question of whether Foxtel%%sqt%%s refusal to take C7 could contravene s 46 of the TP Act%%per%%]$~ 
~$[While Mr de Jong thought it was justifiable ]f[ Foxtel to reject Seven%%sqt%%s 17 November 1999 term sheet%%lst%% it would have been odd %%cmp_if%% Mr Akhurst%%lst%% with his background in trade practices law%%lst%% had ]n[ even adverted to the issue of Foxtel%%sqt%%s market power%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Particularly is this ]s[ when Mr Stokes suggested to Mr Akhurst in their conversation that Foxtel had contravened the TP Act%%per%%

~$[However%%lst%% Ms van Beelen%%sqt%%s chart must have brought home to Mr Akhurst%%lst%% even %%cmp_if%% (as Mr Akhurst said) Mr Stokes did ]n[ mention the issue%%lst%% that Seven was asserting the loss of the AFL pay television rights as a threat to C7%%sqt%%s survival%%per%%]$~

~$[The analysis%%lst%% which was relied on by Seven in its purpose case%%lst%% included the following passages%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%Option A focuses on dealing with Seven/C7 with Foxtel becoming part of the AFL%%sqt%%s media alliances %%cmp_if%% ]^[ when C7 secures access to Foxtel network ]v[ alternatively fails to do so%%per%%]$~

~$[No change has been made in the North as it is ]n[ as popular in these states%%per%%

~$[The paper proposed that Foxtel would be entitled to broadcast four live competition matches per week%%per%%

~$[In his evidence%%lst%% Mr Boyd accepted that the financial model attached to Mr Blomfield%%sqt%%s paper did ]n[ incorporate the changes Mr Boyd had suggested in his memorandum of 20 October 2000%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Boyd agreed that he would have prepared the model after discussing the matter with Mr Blomfield ]^[ on the basis of Mr Blomfield%%sqt%%s instructions%%per%% 
966 Mr Macourt%%sqt%%s evidence was that he had disagreed at the time with the analysis that led to a NPV of %%dsh%%$23%%per%%9 million%%per%%]$~ 
~$[He said his principal criticism was that the analysis lacked a terminal value%%lst%% being the value to Foxtel of additional subscribers%%lst%% at the end of the period under consideration%%lst%% that was attributable to the inclusion of AFL content in Foxtel programming%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Macourt adhered to this view in cross%%dsh%%examination%%lst%% notwithstanding that the term of the proposed licence was only five years%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Macourt said that the modelling had assumed that every subscriber attracted by the AFL would simply terminate his ]v[ her subscription on the day the last AFL game was played%%per%%]$~ 
~$[He considered this to be an unrealistic assumption%%lst%% ]n[ least %%cmp_b%% even %%cmp_if%% Foxtel lost the rights%%lst%% the AFL might still be broadcast on the Foxtel platform%%per%%

~$[He asserted that he could ]n[ recall holding this view himself%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Macourt stated that his view was that the strategic benefit of acquiring the AFL pay television rights was that it enabled Foxtel to obtain a quality AFL package%%per%%]$~ 
~$[I accept Mr Macourt%%sqt%%s evidence on these matters%%per%% 
968 Mr Philip%%sqt%%s evidence was that he regarded Mr Blomfield%%sqt%%s proposal %%sqt%% obviously beneficial %%sqt%% to Foxtel%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In his statement%%lst%% he identified the benefits as follows%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%FOXTEL was likely to have regular live AFL matches in telecast windows acceptable to FOXTEL %%per%%%%per%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[This would enable FOXTEL to have significant control over the presentation of the AFL ]^[ the branding of AFL broadcasts%%per%%]$~ 
~$[I thought that this was likely to greatly assist FOXTEL to bring its penetration in the southern States into line with the penetration %%per%%%%per%%%%per%% in the northern States and%%lst%% given the popularity of AFL in the northern States%%lst%% increase overall penetration %%per%%%%per%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[I did ]n[ think it would be possible to achieve that by FOXTEL taking C7%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Over time%%lst%% I had formed the view that a pay television business which relied on a sports service that was controlled by a free to air operator would be at a significant disadvantage %%cmp_b%% of the likelihood that the free to air operator would program that sports service in a way that favoured its free to air service%%lst%% rather %%cmp_ta%% its pay television operations%%sqt%%%%per%% 
969 In his cross%%dsh%%examination%%lst%% Mr Philip accepted that in October 2000%%lst%% had he thought about it%%lst%% he would have realised that %%cmp_if%% News controlled both the AFL ]^[ NRL pay television rights%%lst%% C7 would have %%sqt%% a hard time %%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[However%%lst%% he claimed that his concern was pursuing the rights ]f[ Foxtel ]^[ that he could ]n[ remember %%sqt%% having many cares about C7%%lst%% to be honest %%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Later in his evidence%%lst%% Mr Philip explained that what he meant by this answer was%%cln%%

~$[I didn%%sqt%%t give it much thought%%lst%% is really what I meant%%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Philip further said that he paid little attention to the projections in the model attached to Mr Blomfield%%sqt%%s paper %%cmp_b%% Mr Macourt did ]n[ think much of the model%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Philip denied that the %%sqt%% obviously beneficial %%sqt%% result he contemplated was that Fox Sports would be rid of its main competitor in the business of supplying sports channels%%per%% 
970 I think the likelihood is that Mr Philip did advert at the time to the possibility that C7 would suffer significant harm %%cmp_if%% it both lost the AFL pay television rights ]^[ did ]n[ succeed in obtaining the NRL pay television rights%%per%%]$~ 
~$[I also think it likely that he was ]n[ concerned %%cmp_if%% any such harm was in fact inflicted on C7%%per%%]$~

8%%per%%28 Flip%%dsh%%Flop Emerges 
971 On 27 October 2000%%lst%% Mr Frykberg advised Mr Blomfield ]^[ Mr Philip that%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%The AFL is keen on having the games involving the local teams in Perth%%lst%% Adelaide%%lst%% Sydney Brisbane being run in those cities the free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air game%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The effect of this is that different games would be run on Friday night%%lst%% Saturday afternoon%%lst%% Saturday night%%lst%% Sunday afternoon in all the major cities%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It has obvious impact on pay television%%per%%]$~ 
~$[You will work out the minuses ]b[ one of the pluses is that pay television will probably get the higher picks in some cities %%cmp_ta%% the 5%%lst%% 6%%lst%% 7%%lst%% 8 currently envisaged%%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[This recorded the origin of what became known as the %%sqt%% flip%%dsh%%flop %%sqt%%%%lst%% which was ultimately included as a term in the News%%dsh%%Foxtel Licence%%per%% 
972 As Seven observes%%lst%% it is common ground that the flip%%dsh%%flop turned out to be detrimental to the value of the AFL pay television rights obtained by Foxtel%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The flip%%dsh%%flop was also detrimental to the fortunes of the Fox Footy channel %%lst%% which utilised the rights%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Williams%%lst%% ]f[ example%%lst%% explained the view he held in 2002%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%By this time%%lst%% I had had the opportunity to observe the AFL arrangements in operation ]f[ a full season%%lst%% ]^[ understood the full implications of the flip flop provision%%per%%]$~ 
~$[My understanding by this stage was%%lst%% ]^[ continues to be%%lst%% that the flip%%dsh%%flop provision effectively meant that FOXTEL was never able to broadcast matches played by a team based in Sydney%%lst%% Brisbane%%lst%% Adelaide ]v[ Perth until the match had first been played on either the Nine Network ]v[ Network Ten%%lst%% even %%cmp_if%% the game was produced by FOXTEL%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It was my view that the implications of this provision were that%%cln%% 
(a) in Adelaide ]^[ Perth in particular%%lst%% the flip%%dsh%%flop provision meant that FOXTEL%%sqt%%s AFL rights gave it no competitive benefit%%lst%% as it was never able to play the games that were of greatest interest to those markets live%%scn%% 
(b) in the northern States of NSW ]^[ Queensland%%lst%% the relevant Commercial Broadcasters often did ]n[ broadcast the matches affected by the flip%%dsh%%flop live%%lst%% ]^[ this meant that there could be a significant delay before the match could be broadcast on the Fox Footy Channel%%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[There is%%lst%% however%%lst%% a dispute as to how far the responsible News ]^[ PBL executives appreciated in 2000 that this was the likely result%%per%% 
973 Mr Frykberg said that he had assumed throughout his negotiations with the AFL that Nine ]^[ Ten would have the first choice of games in each round ]f[ free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air television%%per%%]$~ 
~$[However%%lst%% he believed that this would ]n[ necessarily have the result that Nine ]^[ Ten would have the most attractive games (in the sense of the games likely to appeal to the greatest television audiences)%%per%% 
974 Mr Frykberg also said that at the commencement of his negotiations%%lst%% the AFL%%sqt%%s preference was that games involving the Sydney ]^[ Brisbane teams should be broadcast live in those cities on free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air television%%per%%]$~ 
~$[As the negotiations developed%%lst%% the AFL extended this position to include Perth ]^[ Adelaide%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Frykberg always understood that the AFL saw the flip%%dsh%%flop as a compulsory arrangement in the four capital cities ]f[ which it was proposed%%per%%]$~ 
~$[As his advice of 27 October 2000 indicated%%lst%% Mr Frykberg regarded the flip%%dsh%%flop as having a potential negative impact on pay television%%lst%% ]b[ ]n[ invariably so%%per%%]$~ 
~$[If%%lst%% ]f[ example%%lst%% a Perth team was last on the ladder%%lst%% he thought that that team%%sqt%%s game might be less attractive%%lst%% even in Perth%%lst%% %%cmp_ta%% a game between two top (non%%dsh%%Perth) teams%%per%% 
975 In Mr Frykberg%%sqt%%s cross%%dsh%%examination%%lst%% he was taken to negotiations between Nine ]^[ News (through Mr Philip)%%lst%% whereby Nine sought the opportunity to show the local game in Adelaide ]^[ Perth immediately after the telecast of the national game (even though the local game would already have been under way ]v[ completed on pay television)%%per%%]$~ 
~$[He agreed that the free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air operators were generally keen about some form of flip%%dsh%%flop ]^[ that Mr Philip had made it quite clear that News ]^[ Foxtel would %%sqt%% prefer to avoid a flip%%dsh%%flop %%cmp_if%% that were possible %%sqt%%%%per%%]$~

990 On 2 November 2000%%lst%% Mr Blomfield replied to Mr Greg Willis as follows%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%The AFL is the most important missing element to the services FOXTEL has to offer consumers%%per%%]$~ 
~$[As discussed ]^[ supported by the Board last year%%lst%% the subscription penetration ]^[ performance of FOXTEL would improve overall ]^[ our performance in the southern states would be brought into line with the northern states %%cmp_if%% we were to offer AFL%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Churn will be reduced particularly in the southern states ]^[ the marketing ]^[ sales messages will be greatly enhanced %%cmp_if%% FOXTEL could boast the provision of AFL%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Strategically it is absolutely essential ]f[ FOXTEL to obtain the AFL rights via News ]^[ %%cmp_tf%% in effect directly%%lst%% rather %%cmp_ta%% as suggested%%lst%% to seek supply from C7%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The News bid with the associated FTA party will provide ]f[ a cooperative relationship regarding scheduling of matches ]^[ earlier windows ]f[ the non live matches%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The AFL service%%lst%% as demonstrated by C7 this year%%lst%% will ]n[ present a consumer proposition that would sustain interest ]v[ subscription levels%%sqt%%%%per%% 
991 Mr Blomfield attached a revised financial model which projected an NPV of $1%%per%%1 million to Foxtel over the five year period of the rights%%per%%]$~ 
~$[This model assumed that Foxtel would acquire live rights to three matches%%lst%% rather %%cmp_ta%% four ]^[ that the AFL would be on a tier at a price of $9%%per%%95 pspm%%lst%% rising to $10%%per%%95 pspm%%scn%% that the AFL channel would be supplied to Optus ]^[ Austar%%scn%% that Optus ]^[ Austar would each pay $6%%per%%00 pspm ]f[ the AFL channel (rising to $6%%per%%50) and%%lst%% in addition%%lst%% would each pay %%sqt%% Sign On Bonuses %%sqt%% of $4 million per annum (with specified increases)%%scn%% ]^[ that the rights fee payable by Foxtel would be reduced from $20 million to $17%%per%%5 million per annum (inflation adjusted)%%per%%]$~

~$[The increased penetration on basic by reason of the AFL was assumed to be two per cent in the southern States in 2002%%lst%% rising to six per cent in 2006%%lst%% ]b[ was projected to be only one per cent in the northern States%%per%% 
992 It appears that the change from four exclusively live pay television games to three came about %%cmp_b%% of pressure from Nine%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Originally%%lst%% Nine ]^[ Ten had been offered two live free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air games each week%%lst%% ]b[ Nine insisted on three matches ]f[ itself%%per%% 
993 Mr Akhurst said in evidence that he appreciated at the time that Foxtel%%sqt%%s model assumed a substantial increase in sub%%dsh%%licensing revenue%%lst%% ]y[ incorporated a substantial decrease in the quality of the product (in the sense that Foxtel was to receive only three live pay television matches per week%%lst%% rather %%cmp_ta%% four)%%per%%]$~

994 On 2 November 2000%%lst%% Mr Fogarty sent to Mr Akhurst a short paper outlining the arguments concerning the AFL pay television rights%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The paper said that the recommendation by Telstra management ]n[ to support the proposal ]f[ the put option took account of the following strategic ]^[ commercial implications%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%FOXTEL entering into a legal obligation to take AFL Pay%%dsh%%TV content from News/FOXSPORTS [sic]%%lst%% even %%cmp_if%% NPV positive%%lst%% will assist News/FOXSPORTS to consolidate their position in the Australian Pay%%dsh%%TV market place as the premier ]^[ only (excepting ESPN) content supplier of popular sports programming%%per%%]$~

~$[Whilst today this may ]n[ be of concern%%lst%% in the near future it will mean that FOXSPORTS will have market power to effectively require sporting bodies to deal only with FOXSPORTS giving it the ability to negotiate content supply at lower rates%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Being the premier provider of sporting content will enable FOXSPORTS to extract monopoly profits from pay TV operators ]f[ the supply of that content%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Pay%%dsh%%TV operators such as FOXTEL%%lst%% who do ]n[ own the content%%lst%% become simple distributors ]^[ with their negotiating position considerably weakened by ]n[ owning the content%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Regardless of all the assurances from News/FOXSPORTS our experience to date is that News/FOXSPORTS will always try ]^[ drain funds from FOXTEL%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The benefits to FOXTEL of granting a put option is also very debatable%%per%% 
%%per%%%%per%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The key strategic question is%%cln%%

%%sqt%% (Emphasis added%%per%%

~$[The underlying assumptions represent an optimistic view of the financial impact%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The total cost of the deal over five years including rights ]^[ production costs is $200 million%%per%%]$~ 
~$[We understand that such a sum requires Telstra main board approval%%sqt%%%%per%% 
996 Mr Akhurst agreed in evidence that he understood Mr Fogarty to be expressing a concern that %%cmp_if%% News acquired the AFL pay television rights%%lst%% Fox Sports would become a monopolist as a buyer ]^[ provider of pay television sporting content%%per%%]$~ 
~$[However%%lst%% Mr Akhurst said he was sceptical at the time %%cmp_b%% he knew that there was a range of sports ]^[ that it was implausible that one company would buy all the rights%%per%%]$~

~$[I think it unlikely that Mr Akhurst would have formed the view that Mr Fogarty (a non%%dsh%%lawyer) was likely to be correct in his assessment%%lst%% ]y[ would have failed to take any steps to investigate ]v[ report on the issue%%per%% 
997 On 3 November 2000%%lst%% Mr Blomfield sent a revised AFL financial model to Mr Greg Willis at Telstra%%per%%]$~

1001 Mr Akhurst acknowledged that Mr Willis had sent the fax after a discussion with Mr Fogarty ]^[ Mr Akhurst himself%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Akhurst said that he agreed with the contents of the fax%%per%%]$~ 
~$[When questioned about his response to Mr Brenton Willis%%sqt%% briefing notes of 3 November 2000%%lst%% Mr Akhurst said in evidence that Telstra had always regarded $10%%per%%00 pspm paid by Foxtel ]f[ Fox Sports as too expensive%%per%%]$~

~$[He also understood that the proposal involved the three least appealing games ]f[ Foxtel (in the sense of the least appealing to the viewers generally)%%per%%]$~ 
~$[When asked why he had ]n[ sought to test Seven%%sqt%%s willingness to provide better terms %%cmp_ta%% News%%lst%% Mr Akhurst maintained that his attitude was that he was ]n[ running Foxtel ]^[ that other members of the Foxtel Partnership%%lst%% more experienced ]^[ knowledgeable %%cmp_ta%% he about sporting content%%lst%% thought that direct dealing with the AFL was the way to proceed%%per%% 
1002 Mr Akhurst gave evidence that he participated in a telephone conference held in the afternoon of 3 November 2000 with Dr Switkowski ]^[ Messrs Mansfield%%lst%% Chisholm ]^[ Greg Willis%%per%%]$~

~$[The likelihood is that Mr Chisholm expressed his views to senior Telstra officers both before ]^[ after Mr Greg Willis sent the fax of 3 November 2000%%per%% 
1003 I think that Mr Akhurst%%sqt%%s recollection that he agreed with Mr Blomfield%%sqt%%s approach in the letter of 2 November 2000 (that the AFL pay television rights should be acquired directly from the AFL) is ]n[ correct%%lst%% having regard to his agreement with Mr Greg Willis%%sqt%% response of 3 November 2000%%per%%]$~

~$[Mr Philip%%sqt%%s concern to have a record is particularly odd given his propensity to encourage the deletion ]v[ destruction of records that might be relevant to potential legal proceedings%%per%%

~$[He said nothing about this meeting in his first statement ]^[ dealt with it only in his third statement%%lst%% after he had read the note prepared by Mr Philip%%per%%]$~

~$[Yet in his third statement he provided a detailed account of the conversation (which had occurred four years earlier)%%lst%% based on the note supplemented by Mr Gammell%%sqt%%s own recollection%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Gammell%%sqt%%s account contained additions to ]^[ deletions from the version that had been prepared by Mr Philip after his discussions with Mr Macourt%%per%% 
1045 Certain conclusions can be drawn about this conversation with reasonable confidence%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Gammell told Mr Macourt that Seven needed the exclusive AFL ]v[ NRL pay television rights ]v[ otherwise C7 would have no business%%per%%]$~

8%%per%%41%%per%%3 Significance of the Conversation 
1048 In his oral evidence Mr Gammell accepted that his suggestion to Mr Macourt was an %%sqt%% extraordinary thing to propose %%sqt%% ]^[ %%sqt%% unique %%sqt%% in his experience%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Yet Mr Gammell maintained that he had forgotten the conversation when he made his first statement%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Gammell denied that he was proposing to Mr Macourt that the bidding ]f[ all NRL ]^[ AFL rights be rigged%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Later in his evidence%%lst%% he said that he had recognised at the time that there was a risk that what he was proposing breached the TP Act ]^[ that advice would %%cmp_tf%% be needed%%per%% 
(Prior to giving the later evidence%%lst%% the Court was briefly adjourned to enable Mr Sheahan to give Mr Gammell any necessary advice as to the possible consequences ]f[ him of this evidence%%per%% 
) Mr Gammell said that what he had in mind was a competitive process%%lst%% followed by some kind of matching right in the unsuccessful bidder%%per%%]$~ 
~$[He denied discussing the idea in advance with Mr Stokes%%per%% 
1049 For the most part%%lst%% I prefer Mr Macourt%%sqt%%s account of the conversation to that of Mr Gammell%%lst%% insofar as they are in conflict%%per%%]$~ 
~$[I do ]n[ regard Mr Gammell as a reliable witness when it comes to recalling conversations ]v[ the substance of undocumented transactions%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The circumstances in which Mr Gammell came to recollect the conversation with Mr Macourt do ]n[ inspire confidence in the accuracy of his version%%per%% 
1050 There is one exception to my preference ]f[ Mr Macourt%%sqt%%s account%%per%%]$~ 
~$[I think it is likely that Mr Gammell was correct in substance when he recalled that the conversation concluded with his suggesting a sharing of rights between Foxtel ]^[ C7%%per%%]$~ 
~$[This part of his evidence was potentially adverse to his interests%%lst%% in that it exposed him to the possibility of criticism ]f[ floating a proposal that%%lst%% %%cmp_if%% implemented%%lst%% might have involved a contravention of the TP Act %%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Gammell%%sqt%%s recollection also dovetails%%lst%% to some extent%%lst%% with Mr Philip%%sqt%%s contemplation of a cooperative arrangement through call options ]^[ (as I find) Mr Philip%%sqt%%s discussion of that proposal with Mr Macourt in advance of the meeting%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Furthermore%%lst%% %%cmp_if%% Mr Gammell (or Mr Macourt%%lst%% ]f[ that matter) had suggested a cooperative bidding arrangement during the conversation%%lst%% this would explain Mr Philip%%sqt%%s desire to prepare what was probably a sanitised version of the conversation%%per%% 
1051 Mr Macourt said that he could ]n[ recall any discussion about the sharing of rights%%lst%% as distinct from mention of Foxtel ]^[ C7 acquiring non%%dsh%%exclusive AFL pay television rights%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The note of the conversation made no reference to the sharing of rights%%per%%]$~ 
~$[However%%lst%% Mr Macourt%%lst%% upon being reminded of Mr Philip%%sqt%%s Fallback Scenarios document agreed that it was likely that he had discussed the document with Mr Philip%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Macourt also agreed that the practical effect of Mr Philip%%sqt%%s proposal%%lst%% %%cmp_if%% implemented%%lst%% would have been that neither party would have needed to offer the AFL more %%cmp_ta%% $9 million ]f[ the rights %%cmp_b%% each would have been assured of getting the non%%dsh%%exclusive rights ]f[ that amount%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Macourt%%sqt%%s evidence is thus ]n[ diametrically opposed to Mr Gammell%%sqt%%s on this particular point%%per%% 
1052 News contends that Mr Gammell%%sqt%%s admission that he ]^[ Mr Macourt discussed Foxtel ]^[ C7 taking the AFL pay rights on a non%%dsh%%exclusive basis is inconsistent with Mr Macourt (or News) having the objective of destroying C7%%per%%]$~ 
~$[News points out that Mr Sumption cross%%dsh%%examined Mr Macourt in relation to the AFL%%sqt%%s four column chart on the basis that %%cmp_if%% C7 acquired the non%%dsh%%exclusive AFL pay television rights%%lst%% neither Optus nor Austar would have been able to terminate its content supply agreement with C7%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The relevant passage is as follows%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%If you knew%%lst%% as you plainly did%%lst%% that you believed there were break clauses in both the Optus ]^[ Austar agreements with C7%%lst%% you appreciated%%lst%% didn%%sqt%%t you%%lst%% that those break clauses would operate in the event that AFL rights were no longer possessed by C7? 
%%dsh%%%%dsh%%%%dsh%% Yes%%per%%]$~ 
~$[So it must have been obvious to you when you saw this [the four column chart] in August of 2000 that%%lst%% %%cmp_if%% this proposal went forward%%lst%% those break clauses would ]n[ operate? 
%%dsh%%%%dsh%%%%dsh%% Sorry%%lst%% those break clauses would ]n[ operate%%qsn%%]$~ 
~$[HIS HONOUR%%cln%% In other words%%lst%% Optus ]^[ Austar would ]n[ be able to break their contracts %%cmp_b%% C7 would retain the AFL rights? 
%%dsh%%%%dsh%%%%dsh%% Sorry%%lst%% yes%%per%%]$~ 
~$[MR SUMPTION%%cln%% You would have appreciated that at the time? 
%%dsh%%%%dsh%%%%dsh%% Yes%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It follows%%lst%% doesn%%sqt%%t it%%lst%% that this proposal would have enabled C7 to continue to supply two of the three platforms? 
%%dsh%%%%dsh%%%%dsh%% Yes%%per%%]$~ 
~$[And that%%sqt%%s why you didn%%sqt%%t like it%%lst%% isn%%sqt%%t that right? 
%%dsh%%%%dsh%%%%dsh%% No%%lst%% it is ]n[ right%%sqt%%%%per%% 
1053 Seven%%sqt%%s response to News%%sqt%% contention is that by 4 December 2000%%lst%% Mr Macourt was aware that there was a possibility that News%%sqt%% bid ]f[ the AFL broadcasting rights would ]n[ proceed%%per%%]$~ 
~$[All that Mr Macourt was discussing with Mr Gammell was a possibility that would arise only %%cmp_if%% News%%sqt%% plan to acquire the AFL pay television rights exclusively ]f[ Foxtel fell through%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It follows%%lst%% according to Seven%%lst%% that Mr Macourt%%sqt%%s proposal to Mr Gammell was ]n[ inconsistent with Mr Macourt having the objective of destroying C7 by means of News%%sqt%% ]^[ Foxtel%%sqt%%s bid ]f[ the exclusive AFL pay television rights%%per%% 
1054 The evidence to which I have referred shows (despite Mr Philip%%sqt%%s refusal to concede the point) that Mr Macourt had seen Mr Philip%%sqt%%s Fallback Scenarios document before he (Mr Macourt) met Mr Gammell on 4 December 2000%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Even so%%lst%% it is ]n[ entirely clear what Mr Macourt was proposing to Mr Gammell%%per%%]$~ 
~$[If it was an arrangement intended to replace News%%sqt%% planned bid%%lst%% the proposal would be inconsistent with Mr Macourt wanting C7 destroyed since the offer%%lst%% %%cmp_if%% accepted%%lst%% would have permitted C7 to retain the fruits of the C7%%dsh%%Optus CSA ]^[ the C7%%dsh%%Austar CSA%%per%%]$~ 
~$[If%%lst%% however%%lst%% Mr Macourt was suggesting an arrangement to take effect only %%cmp_if%% News%%sqt%% bid failed%%lst%% ]v[ %%cmp_if%% the bid did ]n[ go ahead (for example%%lst%% %%cmp_b%% Nine ]^[ Ten pulled out)%%lst%% his proposal would ]n[ necessarily have been inconsistent with his having decided that News ]^[ Foxtel should bid ]f[ the AFL pay television rights in order to destroy C7%%sqt%%s viability as a sports channel provider%%per%% 
1055 Mr Macourt did ]n[ explain in his evidence precisely what he conveyed to Mr Gammell%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In the absence of such an explanation%%lst%% I think it likely that Mr Macourt was canvassing the idea of a cooperative approach in the event that the News%%sqt%% bid did ]n[ go ahead%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Nonetheless%%lst%% it is clear from Mr Gammell%%sqt%%s evidence that Mr Macourt explicitly stated that he (Mr Macourt) was happy ]f[ C7 to have the non%%dsh%%exclusive rights ]s[ that C7 could continue its relationship with Optus%%per%%]$~ 
~$[If Mr Macourt truly had the objective of destroying C7 (if necessary by making a predatory bid ]f[ the AFL pay television rights)%%lst%% the making of such a statement would have been duplicitous%%per%%]$~ 
~$[If Mr Macourt had that objective%%lst%% he certainly would ]n[ have been happy ]f[ C7 to continue its relationship with Optus%%lst%% let alone survive as a viable sports channel%%per%% 
1056 Mr Macourt was cross%%dsh%%examined after Mr Gammell had given evidence%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Macourt was questioned about the conversation of 4 December 2000 with Mr Gammell%%lst%% ]b[ it was never put to him that he had acted duplicitously%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Sumption contends that Mr Macourt could have been in no doubt that his evidence was being challenged%%per%%]$~ 
~$[He also says that he chose ]n[ to cross%%dsh%%examine Mr Macourt in detail about the events in the last six months of 2000 %%cmp_b%% the relevant acts were done by Mr Philip %%sqt%% by way of delegation %%sqt%%%%per%% 
1057 I think that this submission overstates the extent to which Mr Philip took over the process%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Macourt continued to play an important role%%lst%% ]n[ least as a News decision%%dsh%%maker at the teleconference of 13 December 2000%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Without insisting on a rigid interpretation of the so%%dsh%%called rule in Browne v Dunn (1893) 6 R 67%%lst%% I would have thought that %%cmp_if%% I am to be invited in effect to find that Mr Macourt acted duplicitously in his dealings with Mr Gammell on 4 December 2000%%lst%% it would have been helpful %%cmp_if%% the allegation had been made directly to Mr Macourt ]^[ he had been given an opportunity to respond%%per%%]$~ 
~$[While there is no doubt that Mr Philip was perfectly prepared to act in a deliberately dishonest manner in his dealings with third parties (in particular%%lst%% Telstra)%%lst%% ]^[ while Mr Macourt on his own evidence did ]n[ always behave with perfect propriety in his commercial dealings%%lst%% I am ]n[ satisfied that Mr Macourt acted in a duplicitous manner in the course of his conversation with Mr Gammell%%per%% 
1058 It follows%%lst%% in my opinion%%lst%% that the conversation of 4 December 2000 lends support to Mr Macourt%%sqt%%s denial that he understood that News%%sqt%% bid ]f[ the AFL pay television rights was ]f[ the substantial purpose of destroying C7%%per%% 
8%%per%%42 Foxtel Develops Its Bid ]f[ the AFL Pay Television Rights 
1059 On 1 December 2000%%lst%% Mr Boyd prepared a financial model on the basis of an instruction from Mr Blomfield to equalise the market penetration of Foxtel in the northern ]^[ southern states%%per%%]$~ 
~$[He thought at the time that an earlier model prepared by him had done exactly that%%lst%% ]b[ he later realised that in fact that was ]n[ so%%per%% 
1060 In early December 2000%%lst%% Mr Frykberg told Mr Philip that it might be necessary ]f[ News to pay up to $30 million ]f[ the AFL pay television rights%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Following that conversation%%lst%% Mr Philip told Mr Blomfield that $20 million might ]n[ get Foxtel the rights%%lst%% ]^[ that $25 million ]v[ $30 million might be required%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Philip asked Mr Blomfield to prepare %%sqt%% models which indicate what assumptions need to be made to support an acquisition at $25 million ]^[ $30 million %%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Philip said in evidence that%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%I intended that FOXTEL might use these models ]f[ the purpose of convincing Telstra to support FOXTEL%%sqt%%s acquisition of the AFL rights%%per%%]$~ 
~$[For my own part%%lst%% I did ]n[ place a great deal of reliance on the models %%per%%%%per%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[I saw the acquisition of the AFL rights as a strategic acquisition ]^[ I did ]n[ necessarily expect it to be cash flow positive ]f[ FOXTEL%%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[He also said that he asked Mr Blomfield to start by assuming a licence fee of $25 million ]^[ $30 million ]^[ %%cmp_t%% work out what facts were required to produce a positive NPV%%per%% 
1061 Curiously enough%%lst%% Mr Frykberg himself did ]n[ give evidence that he had told Mr Philip that up to $30 million might be required to obtain the AFL pay television rights%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Philip gave that evidence ]^[ ]f[ tactical ]v[ other reasons%%lst%% was ]n[ challenged by Seven on it%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Indeed%%lst%% Seven specifically accepts that Mr Frykberg told Mr Philip that the %%cmp_t%% current bid of $17%%per%%5 million per annum ]f[ the AFL pay television rights would ]n[ be sufficient ]^[ that it might have to be $25 million ]v[ even as high as $30 million%%per%%

~$[Although Mr Philip ]^[ Mr Frykberg worked closely together%%lst%% Seven does ]n[ suggest that Mr Frykberg was party to%%lst%% ]v[ knew of%%lst%% any strategy to kill C7 by means of Foxtel paying more ]f[ the AFL pay television rights %%cmp_ta%% their true value%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Why%%lst%% %%cmp_t%%%%lst%% would Mr Frykberg advise Mr Philip as he did%%lst%% unless he thought that up to $30 million was the price required to succeed in a competitive auction?

~$[Following this conversation%%lst%% Mr Boyd prepared a $30 million model ]^[ faxed a copy of that model ]^[ an earlier $25 million model to Mr Philip ]^[ to Mr Blomfield%%per%% 
1064 At about this time%%lst%% Mr Blomfield informed Mr Campbell that the fee ]f[ the AFL pay television rights was likely to be $30 million%%per%%]$~

~$[Mr Campbell explained further in his oral evidence%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%What did you mean to convey by saying it was up to you to make the financial model work?

8%%per%%49%%per%%1 The Bid 
1085 Seven made a presentation to the AFL commencing at about 7%%per%%30 pm on Thursday%%lst%% 14 December 2000%%per%%]$~ 
~$[By this time%%lst%% Mr Stokes was aware that C7 had ]n[ obtained the NRL pay television rights%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The presentation consisted of a written proposal%%lst%% compiled over the previous two to three weeks%%lst%% ]^[ an audio%%dsh%%visual presentation%%lst%% part of which was scripted%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Messrs Gammell%%lst%% Wise%%lst%% Francis and%%lst%% to a lesser extent%%lst%% Stokes participated in the preparation of the documentation%%per%% 
1086 The written proposal incorporated a bid of $60 million per annum ]f[ all free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air ]^[ pay television rights ]f[ the period 2002 to 2006%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In addition%%lst%% Seven offered $4 million in contra ]^[ $8 million in sponsorships%%lst%% club development ]^[ the promotion of a Seven%%dsh%%AFL online venture%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The offer ]f[ all AFL broadcasting rights was made notwithstanding that%%lst%% as Mr Wise acknowledged in his evidence%%lst%% Seven appreciated that the AFL wanted separate bids ]f[ the AFL free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air ]^[ pay television rights%%per%% 
1088 The document also contained some statements that were inaccurate%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It incorrectly stated%%lst%% ]f[ example%%lst%% that Seven had reached in principle agreement with Telstra on a proposal ]f[ a sports site on the internet ]^[ that C7 had distribution rights such that it could reach all pay subscribers in Australia%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In addition%%lst%% the words %%sqt%% up to %%sqt%% were deliberately inserted in Seven%%sqt%%s proposed commitment to indicate that this level of live ]^[ exclusive coverage on C7 was ]n[ guaranteed%%per%%]$~ 
~$[As Mr Wise pointed out in evidence%%lst%% Seven%%sqt%%s contract with Optus required Seven to supply only 16 games per season%%per%%

%%sqt%%Mr Evans%%cln%% Will you make a separate offer ]f[ free to air?

8%%per%%49%%per%%2 Seven%%sqt%%s Evidence on the Quantum of the Bid 
1091 There were some unsatisfactory features of Seven%%sqt%%s evidence concerning the decision to bid $60 million per annum ]f[ the AFL broadcasting rights%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Stokes%%sqt%% evidence was that the decision was made before Thursday%%lst%% 14 December 2000 (the date of the presentation to the AFL)%%lst%% probably on the previous weekend%%per%%]$~ 
~$[He said that this was the culmination of a series of discussions involving Ms Plavsic%%lst%% Mr Gammell%%lst%% Mr Wise ]^[ Mr Anderson%%per%%]$~ 
~$[A consensus was reached that a single offer should be made ]f[ both free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air ]^[ pay television rights%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Stokes said that although Seven had been prepared to offer $30 million ]f[ the AFL pay television rights%%lst%% no mention was made of this in the presentation to the AFL%%per%%]$~ 
~$[According to Mr Stokes%%lst%% the offer of $60 million per annum was the best Seven could make%%lst%% having regard to likely costs ]^[ revenues ]^[ strategic considerations%%per%% 
1092 Mr Gammell%%sqt%%s recollection was that the decision was made at a meeting between himself%%lst%% Mr Stokes ]^[ Mr Wise on the morning of 14 December 2000%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Stokes had said at the meeting that Seven was %%sqt%% pushing the edge of the envelope %%sqt%% ]^[ that $60 million per annum was the best price Seven could offer pay without overpaying%%per%% 
1093 Mr Wise%%sqt%%s evidence was that he had calculated the appropriate bid to make ]f[ the AFL broadcasting rights ]^[ that he had explained his reasoning process at a meeting held with Mr Stokes ]^[ Mr Gammell in the morning of 14 December 2000%%per%% 
1094 According to Mr Wise%%lst%% the critical risk to be factored into the bid was that C7 would ]n[ be shown on Foxtel%%per%%]$~ 
~$[He reached this conclusion in part %%cmp_b%% he thought that C7 could be expected to recover costs of about $12 million from Optus ]^[ Austar%%per%%]$~ 
~$[He calculated that the benefits of carriage on Foxtel should be assessed at $3%%per%%00 pspm%%lst%% a figure he said was derived from C7%%sqt%%s offer to Foxtel of November 1999%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Wise%%sqt%%s understanding at the time (so he said) was that Seven%%sqt%%s earlier proposal was equivalent to 80 per cent of the fee paid by Foxtel to Fox Sports%%lst%% being $7%%per%%50 pspm%%lst%% ]s[ that C7 was to be paid $6%%per%%00 pspm%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The figure of $3%%per%%00 pspm was simply 50 per cent of $6%%per%%00 pspm%%lst%% reflecting an MSG of 50 per cent penetration ]f[ a tier carrying C7%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Wise said that the total cost to Foxtel of purchasing the C7 channel at $3%%per%%00 pspm would be less %%cmp_ta%% the cost of purchasing the AFL pay television rights directly ]^[ that production costs ]^[ the value of non%%dsh%%AFL programming had been factored in%%per%% 
1095 Mr Wise%%sqt%%s evidence did ]n[ withstand cross%%dsh%%examination%%per%%]$~ 
~$[He acknowledged that he had been wrong in claiming that his calculations had been based on the terms of C7%%sqt%%s November 1999 offer%%per%%]$~ 
~$[He %%cmp_t%% asserted that they were in fact based on discussions between Mr Stokes ]^[ Mr Blomfield in late 2000%%lst%% discussions he had ]n[ previously mentioned%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Wise also admitted that by December 2000%%lst%% he knew that Foxtel was paying Fox Sports approximately US$8%%per%%00 pspm%%lst%% ]n[ $7%%per%%50%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Perhaps more significantly%%lst%% Mr Wise admitted that the figure of $12 million to be recouped from Optus ]^[ Austar%%lst%% reflected Seven%%sqt%%s internal accounting%%lst%% ]n[ the amounts (exceeding $35 million) likely to be derived by C7 from those platforms%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Finally%%lst%% Mr Wise agreed that his calculations concerning the comparative costs of Foxtel acquiring the AFL pay television rights directly from the AFL ]v[ from C7 had been %%sqt%% seriously flawed %%sqt%%%%per%% 
1096 The likelihood is that the final decision to pitch the bid ]f[ the AFL broadcasting rights at $60 million was made at a meeting on the morning of 14 December 2000%%per%%]$~ 
~$[This conclusion is supported by the fact that a draft presentation of 13 December 2000 recorded a proposed cash bid of $56 million ]f[ the AFL broadcasting rights%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The final decision was probably made by Mr Stokes ]^[ Mr Gammell in consultation with Mr Wise%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Stokes%%sqt%% recollection on these matters was unreliable%%per%% 
1097 I accept News%%sqt%% submission that regardless of what Mr Stokes may have said at the meeting%%lst%% the offer made on 14 December 2000 by Seven was neither the most that Seven could have reasonably offered%%lst%% given the potential benefits (had they been assessed correctly)%%lst%% nor what Seven believed the broadcasting rights to be worth once the true value of the AFL pay television rights was taken into account%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The latter proposition is supported by Mr Stokes%%sqt%% offer of $30 million ]f[ the pay television rights alone%%lst%% ]^[ his evidence concerning that offer%%lst%% as well as the fact that Mr Stokes wrongly assumed that there would be a further opportunity ]f[ Seven to bid separately ]f[ the AFL pay television rights %%cmp_if%% its offer ]f[ the broadcasting rights was unsuccessful%%per%%

~$[He had taken the view that the incorporation of NRL matches into C7%%sqt%%s channel on Optus%%lst%% from 1998 to 2000%%lst%% had given C7 a %%sqt%% windfall benefit %%sqt%% through a brand association with Rugby League programming%%lst%% without C7 having invested heavily in the product%%per%%

1200 The consequence of these proposals%%lst%% %%cmp_if%% implemented%%lst%% would have been to require the inclusion of provisions in an agreement with the NRL Partnership in any offer made by the NRL Partnership to Optus pursuant to the matching provisions of the Optus Partners Funding Deed%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In his evidence%%lst%% Mr Philip acknowledged that he knew Optus did ]n[ want to produce its own programs ]^[ thus he knew that the proposed requirement would make it unattractive ]f[ Optus to match Fox Sports%%sqt%% bid%%per%%]$~

9%%per%%15 Further Discussions 
1284 According to Mr Philip%%lst%% shortly after 1 December 2000 he had a conversation with Mr Macourt in which they agreed that the effect of the newspaper coverage would be that C7%%sqt%%s bid would be perceived as being better %%cmp_ta%% that of Fox Sports%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It was also agreed that Fox Sports would have to be seen as having offered at least $39 million per annum ]f[ the NRL pay television rights%%per%%]$~

~$[Nor did he consider that C7 was serious in claiming confidentiality%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Rather he considered it a tactical device to prevent Mr Macourt ]^[ him from participating fully in the bidding process ]^[ to enable C7 to justify termination of any agreement resulting from the NRL PEC%%sqt%%s acceptance of its offer%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Philip also claimed that%%lst%% while he regarded himself as free to use the details of C7%%sqt%%s bid%%lst%% he did ]n[ wish to expose himself ]v[ Fox Sports to a spurious claim ]f[ disclosure of confidential information%%per%%]$~ 
~$[He %%cmp_tf%% thought it undesirable ]f[ him to disclose the details of C7%%sqt%%s offers in his own dealings%%per%% 
1286 Mr Philip said that from early December he began to formulate ways ]f[ Fox Sports to finance a revised bid ]f[ the NRL pay television rights%%per%%]$~ 
~$[As part of that process%%lst%% he decided that he would attempt to persuade Telstra to contribute to the bid through the NRL naming ]^[ internet rights ]^[ to approve Fox Sports%%sqt%% licensing of NRL coverage to Optus%%per%%]$~

~$[Mr Stokes%%sqt%% explanation ]f[ this apparently onerous construction of the offer (from Seven%%sqt%%s point of view) was contained in the following passage%%cln%%

%%dsh%%%%dsh%%%%dsh%% The original price we had offered%%lst%% your Honour%%lst%% was 60 million%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Yes? 
%%dsh%%%%dsh%%%%dsh%% Part of the philosophy ]f[ the table was to give the rights holders%%lst%% the NRL themselves%%lst%% an incentive to help us get on to Foxtel%%per%%]$~ 
~$[We were always confident that we were prepared to pay $60 million%%lst%% ]^[ that didn%%sqt%%t have any conditions on it%%per%%]$~

~$[It would ]n[ be assured%%lst%% would it%%lst%% in those circumstances that Foxtel would put C7 on basic ]v[ at least put the NRL through C7 on basic? 
%%dsh%%%%dsh%%%%dsh%% No%%lst%% it wouldn%%sqt%%t be%%sqt%%%%per%% 
1294 Mr Macourt%%sqt%%s contemporaneous note on his copy of C7%%sqt%%s offer was that the formula was %%sqt%% ]n[ clear [whether it meant] tier subscribers ]v[ basic %%sqt%%%%per%%]$~

~$[Mr Philip suggested that %%cmp_if%% Optus would ]n[ take the NRL%%lst%% Foxtel should pay an additional $8 million per annum ]f[ the NRL pay television rights%%per%%

%%sqt%%(a) I knew C7%%sqt%%s offer of 5 December 2000 was ]n[ as I described the %%dqt%%C7 offer%%dqt%% in paragraph 1 of my fax%%per%%

~$[I had already decided to vote against the C7 bid %%cmp_if%% it came to be considered by the NRL Partnership Executive Committee ]^[ I knew the C7 bid could ]n[ be accepted without a unanimous decision of the PEC%%per%%]$~

~$[I wanted to avoid News Ltd being criticised ]f[ making the NRL accept a lower bid %%cmp_ta%% the C7 bid%%per%%]$~

~$[I thought that%%lst%% %%cmp_if%% that happened%%lst%% C7 was likely to withdraw its NRL bid%%per%%]$~ 
~$[If C7 withdrew its NRL bid%%lst%% %%cmp_t%% I thought it would still be necessary to present the Fox Sports bid as worth at least $39 million in order to avoid News Ltd ]^[ the NRL PEC being criticised ]f[ ]n[ accepting the C7 bid while it was open%%per%%]$~

~$[Given that Mr Philip asked Mr Akhurst to destroy the first fax ]^[ that Mr Philip destroyed his own copy of the second document%%lst%% it is plausible that he did ask Mr Akhurst ]^[ Mr Falloon to destroy the second document%%lst%% even though it did ]n[ seem to reveal any information about C7%%sqt%%s bid that could be regarded as confidential%%per%%]$~

9%%per%%19 A Meeting Between Mr Stokes ]^[ Mr James Packer? 
1329 According to Mr Stokes%%lst%% at some point during the weekend of 9 ]^[ 10 December 2000%%lst%% he had a meeting with James Packer%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Stokes%%sqt%% account of the conversation is as follows%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%Mr Packer%%cln%% 
I%%sqt%%ve come to tell you that we%%sqt%%re going to take the AFL rights off you%%per%%]$~ 
~$[We%%sqt%%re all going to get together to take those rights%%per%%]$~ 
~$[We don%%sqt%%t really want to do it ]b[ News are making us%%per%%]$~ 
~$[I said%%cln%% 
Why would you want to spend all the extra money%%qsn%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Packer said%%cln%% 
Well%%lst%% that%%sqt%%s what we%%sqt%%re going to do%%per%%]$~ 
~$[And I hear you%%sqt%%re trying to do something with the NRL rights%%per%%]$~ 
~$[I said%%cln%% 
Yes%%lst%% you haven%%sqt%%t left us with any choice%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Packer said%%cln%% 
I can%%sqt%%t believe News would have left the back door open%%per%%]$~ 
~$[We%%sqt%%ve gone ]^[ closed all the gates ]^[ got everything set ]^[ they go ]^[ leave a huge back door open%%per%%]$~ 
~$[But it doesn%%sqt%%t matter what you spend%%lst%% I would ]n[ be against Rupert when it comes to getting the NRL rights%%per%%]$~ 
~$[I said%%cln%% 
I understand very clearly what it means to go up against the both of you%%lst%% ]b[ I am ]n[ going to be run out of my own country ]^[ Seven will remain a competitor%%sqt%%%%per%% 
1330 There are a number of difficulties with Mr Stokes%%sqt%% account%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The first relates to the timing of the conversation%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Stokes was overseas from 26 November 2000 to 8 December 2000%%per%%]$~ 
~$[He gave evidence that Mr Packer%%sqt%%s secretary telephoned him (Mr Stokes) on his mobile telephone%%lst%% saying that Mr Packer wanted to see him%%per%%]$~ 
~$[No records were tendered supporting the making of such a call ]v[ the holding of a meeting on the weekend identified by Mr Stokes%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Nor did Mr Stokes make any notes of the conversation with Mr Packer%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It appears that his first account of the conversation to a third party was to Seven%%sqt%%s solicitors in early 2003%%lst%% well over two years after the event%%per%% 
1331 Mr Stokes placed the date of the meeting with Mr Packer by a %%sqt%% process of elimination %%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[After referring to his diaries (which did ]n[ record the meeting) ]^[ other documentation relating to his movements%%lst%% he thought that this weekend was the only time the meeting could have happened%%per%%]$~ 
~$[However%%lst%% it is implausible that on the weekend of 9%%dsh%%10 December 2000 Mr Packer would have made the first statement attributed to him by Mr Stokes%%per%%]$~ 
~$[By that time%%lst%% Seven was actively promoting the intervention of the ACCC to prevent a combined bid by News%%lst%% PBL ]^[ Foxtel ]f[ the AFL broadcasting rights%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Newspaper articles had been published about the proposed bid%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Packer is hardly likely to have been bringing Mr Stokes news of something that had been common knowledge ]f[ a long time%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Similarly it would be odd %%cmp_if%% Mr Packer had said during a meeting on that weekend that he had heard that Seven was trying to do something with the NRL pay television rights%%per%%]$~ 
~$[By early December 2000%%lst%% as PBL points out%%lst%% C7%%sqt%%s bids ]f[ the NRL pay television rights had attracted extensive publicity ]^[ indeed the details of its second bid had been published in the press%%per%% 
1332 Seven%%lst%% in its Reply Submissions%%lst%% attempts to make a virtue out of necessity by citing an email from Mr Stokes%%sqt%% personal assistant to Mr Packer which was sent at 7%%per%%02 pm on Friday%%lst%% 24 November 2000%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The email gave Mr Packer Mr Stokes%%sqt%% mobile number ]^[ confirmed that it was in order ]f[ Mr Packer to call Mr Stokes the next day (Saturday)%%lst%% 25 November%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Seven submits that the email supports Mr Stokes%%sqt%% account of the conversation%%lst%% except that Seven says that I should find%%lst%% contrary to Mr Stokes%%sqt%% evidence%%lst%% that the meeting took place during the weekend of 25%%dsh%%26 November 2000%%per%% 
1333 By 25 November 2000%%lst%% although accurate details of C7%%sqt%%s first bid had ]n[ appeared in the media%%lst%% there had been speculation about the contents of the bid in newspaper articles appearing on 18 ]^[ 20 November 2000%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It is quite possible%%lst%% %%cmp_tf%%%%lst%% that Mr Packer%%lst%% on 25 November 2000%%lst%% might have said words to the effect of %%sqt%% I hear you%%sqt%%re trying to do something with the NRL rights%%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[However%%lst%% Seven had expressed concern about the proposed joint bid ]f[ the AFL broadcasting rights well before 25 November%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It is highly unlikely that Mr Packer would have said to Mr Stokes that he had come to tell Mr Stokes that a group was going to get together to take the rights off Seven%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Stokes accepted that around 9 ]^[ 10 November he had become aware of press articles reporting the fact of a bid ]f[ the AFL broadcasting rights by a consortium%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Stokes had made some public comments on the subject at ]v[ shortly after Seven%%sqt%%s annual general meeting on 17 November 2000%%per%%]$~ 
~$[On 22 November 2000%%lst%% Seven%%sqt%%s solicitors had written to the ACCC expressing Seven%%sqt%%s concern about the potential ]f[ misuse of market power by %%sqt%% the PBL/News/Telstra consortium %%sqt%% in relation to the bidding ]f[ the AFL broadcasting rights%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Even as early as 25 November 2000%%lst%% Mr Packer (as he surely would have known) would ]n[ have been conveying new information to Mr Stokes about the joint bid ]f[ the AFL broadcasting rights%%per%% 
1334 Secondly%%lst%% the absence of any record of the conversation until more %%cmp_ta%% two years had elapsed is significant%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In his evidence%%lst%% Mr Stokes vacillated about whether%%lst%% by November 2000%%lst%% Seven was contemplating legal action against Foxtel ]^[ others in respect of the consortium%%sqt%%s bid ]f[ the AFL broadcasting rights%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Stokes ultimately conceded that by mid%%dsh%%November 2000 he was indeed giving serious consideration to instituting legal proceedings against the parties bidding ]f[ the AFL broadcasting rights%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Stokes had little choice in making that concession%%lst%% since in an email he sent to Mr Gammell ]^[ Mr Wise on 18 November 2000%%lst%% he referred to the streng%%cmp_t%%ing of %%sqt%% future actions that we would %%per%%%%per%%%%per%% have against Foxtel%%lst%% News ]^[ PBL %%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[By %%sqt%% future actions %%sqt%% Mr Stokes meant (as he accepted) possible future legal proceedings%%per%% 
1335 I accept Seven%%sqt%%s submission that Mr Stokes is ]n[ a person who is in the habit of making notes of conversations%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It is nonetheless curious that %%cmp_if%% Mr Stokes thought that Mr Packer%%sqt%%s comments important%%lst%% he did ]n[ cause a record to be made ]v[ did ]n[ communicate by email the fact of the conversation much earlier %%cmp_ta%% he did%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It is clear%%lst%% although Mr Stokes did ]n[ accept this unequivocally%%lst%% that he had been told long before November 2000 that he should keep a record of anything which might provide evidence of collusion between News ]^[ PBL%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In fact%%lst%% Mr Stokes did ]n[ communicate his recollection of the conversation to his solicitors until more %%cmp_ta%% a year after Gyles J had delivered an important judgment in the preliminary discovery proceedings%%per%% 
1336 Thirdly%%lst%% in my opinion%%lst%% it is implausible that Mr Packer would have said to Mr Stokes that PBL did ]n[ want to take the AFL broadcasting rights off Seven ]^[ that News had %%sqt%% made %%sqt%% PBL participate in the bid%%per%%]$~ 
~$[As Mr Stokes knew%%lst%% Nine had sought to acquire the AFL free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air rights on separate occasions over a number of years%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In these circumstances%%lst%% it would have been extraordinary ]f[ Mr Packer to plead helplessness%%per%% 
1337 A fourth difficulty is that%%lst%% as I have explained %%cmp_e%%where%%lst%% Mr Stokes%%sqt%% evidence was characterised by strong tendency to reconstruct events as he wished them to have been rather %%cmp_ta%% as they were%%per%%]$~ 
~$[I approach his uncorroborated evidence of conversations%%lst%% in ]s[ far as his account is favourable to Seven%%sqt%%s interests%%lst%% with considerable caution%%per%%]$~ 
~$[For the reasons I have given%%lst%% there are particular grounds to view his account of the conversation with Mr Packer in this way%%per%% 
1338 I appreciate that it is necessary to pay due attention to the fact that Mr Packer was available to give evidence%%lst%% ]b[ was ]n[ called by PBL%%per%%]$~ 
~$[His unexplained absence from the witness box could justify an inference that his evidence would ]n[ have assisted PBL%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Certainly%%lst%% Mr Packer%%sqt%%s absence from the witness box requires me to think carefully before rejecting Mr Stokes%%sqt%% evidence in whole ]v[ in part%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Nonetheless%%lst%% the fact that Mr Packer did ]n[ give evidence does ]n[ mean that I must accept Mr Stokes%%sqt%% account%%lst%% having regard to the fact that his version was directly challenged in cross%%dsh%%examination%%per%%]$~ 
~$[I must assess the evidence in its entirety%%lst%% including any inference that may be available from Mr Packer%%sqt%%s unexplained absence from the witness box%%per%% 
1339 I think it probable that a meeting took place between Mr Stokes ]^[ Mr Packer in late November 2000%%lst%% most likely in the course of the weekend before Mr Stokes%%sqt%% departure on 26 November ]f[ his overseas trip%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Stokes said in evidence that he ]^[ Mr Packer discussed in some depth free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air television%%per%%]$~ 
~$[I think it likely that a conversation took place which included references to the competing bids ]f[ the AFL broadcasting rights%%lst%% especially the free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air rights%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In that context Mr Stokes may well have asked Mr Packer why PBL was prepared to pay ]s[ much ]f[ the free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air rights%%per%%]$~ 
~$[I do ]n[ accept%%lst%% however%%lst%% that Mr Packer told Mr Stokes that PBL%%lst%% News ]^[ Foxtel were all going to get together to take the AFL broadcasting rights away from Seven%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Nor do I accept that Mr Packer said that Nine did ]n[ %%sqt%% really want to do it %%sqt%%%%lst%% ]b[ had been forced by News to participate in the bid%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Similarly I am unable to accept that Mr Packer made observations in the conversation about News leaving %%sqt%% the back door open %%sqt%%%%lst%% at least in a context suggesting that News ]^[ PBL were joining forces to deprive Seven of both the AFL ]^[ NRL pay television rights%%per%% 
9%%per%%20 Ms Ireland%%sqt%%s Letter of 13 December 2000 
1340 On 11 December 2000%%lst%% Mr Gallop wrote to the Director of Legal Affairs at Foxtel Management (Ms Ireland)%%per%%]$~

~$[Prior to sending the letter%%lst%% she forwarded a draft to Mr Gallop asking him to confirm that he was happy with it%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In the final version sent on 13 December 2000%%lst%% Ms Ireland noted that there were still many issues to be determined before the ACCC could make a final determination about access%%per%% 
1342 Ms Ireland said that Foxtel estimated that it might be 12 months before the ACCC could make a final determination as to access%%per%%]$~ 
~$[While the ACCC had power to make an interim determination%%lst%% Foxtel%%sqt%%s view was that this was inappropriate ]^[ Foxtel might challenge any such determination%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The effect of this is that C7 will have to put its own STUs into the home which will mean there are 2 STUs %%cmp_if%% the C7 subscriber is also a FOXTEL subscriber%%per%%]$~

~$[The analysis identified two major variables built into C7%%sqt%%s offer%%cln%% first%%lst%% the fees depended on subscriber levels and%%lst%% secondly%%lst%% there was uncertainty as to whether Nine would broadcast only two games per week%%lst%% broadcast two games per week ]^[ another 12 matches over the season%%lst%% ]v[ broadcast three games per week%%per%% 
1349 The summary identified three alternative cases%%cln%%

1368 When asked in cross%%dsh%%examination whether the outcome of the meeting was an agreement between all parties represented that the two proposed bids as outlined would proceed%%lst%% Mr Philip answered as follows%%cln%%

~$[Mr Moriarty was more positive%%per%% 
1372 Mr Akhurst%%sqt%%s reasons ]f[ supporting the NRL bid were these%%cln%%

~$[Although I do ]n[ recall discussing those matters with Dr Switkowski ]v[ any of the other Telstra representatives either during the telephone conference ]v[ prior to finalising the terms of the bid documents%%lst%% it is likely that I discussed those matters with Dr Switkowski ]^[ that he supported by views in relation to the NRL rights%%sqt%%%%per%%

~$[However%%lst%% he denied that this was what he wanted to stop%%per%%]$~

~$[Foxtel could brand it Foxtel etc all over the viewing%%sqt%%%%per%% 
1410 Mr Philip%%lst%% in conjunction with Mr Akhurst%%lst%% prepared a number of draft term sheets giving effect to the proposal that had been discussed between them%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In the course of discussion%%lst%% Mr Akhurst raised the concept of a channel specifically designed ]f[ Optus%%lst%% to be known as %%sqt%% Fox Sports 3 %%sqt%%%%per%%]$~

1428 On 27 July 1999%%lst%% Mr North sent Mr Stokes an aide%%dsh%%memoire in preparation ]f[ a meeting Mr Stokes was scheduled to have with Professor Fels%%lst%% the %%cmp_t%% Chairman of the ACCC%%lst%% on 29 July 1999%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The aide%%dsh%%memoire pointed out that the ACCC had been concerned ]f[ some time%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%at the concentration of ownership of program rights%%lst%% particularly in the Pay TV industry%%lst%% ]^[ the extent to which those rights can be used to limit competition%%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr North suggested that%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%[the] core of your argument should be that Packer ]^[ Murdoch are using their market power in the various forms of media ]^[ communications at their disposal %%dsh%%%%dsh%%%%dsh%% free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air television%%lst%% Pay TV%%lst%% newspapers%%lst%% magazines%%lst%% the Internet ]^[ telephone services %%dsh%%%%dsh%%%%dsh%% to persuade the AFL ]n[ to renew your broadcasting rights%%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr North said that such an outcome would ]n[ be acceptable as it would contravene the TP Act %%per%% 
1429 Mr North also identified access to pay television infrastructure as a matter of interest to the ACCC%%per%%]$~ 
~$[He noted that the ACCC was committed to fighting this issue on behalf of TARBS ]^[ to winning it%%per%%]$~ 
~$[He considered that the ACCC was keen to secure Seven%%sqt%%s support on this issue %%sqt%% as C7 should also be permitted to offer its own channels on Foxtel%%sqt%%s cable service %%sqt%% %%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Stokes read this aide%%dsh%%memoire ]^[ used it in determining what he should put to Professor Fels at their meeting%%per%% 
1430 Shortly before 3 August 1999%%lst%% Mr North ]^[ Mr Stokes had a meeting to discuss Mr North%%sqt%%s engagement on a longer term basis%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr North sent a fax to Mr Stokes on 3 August 1999%%lst%% outlining a proposed course of action on a number of issues%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr North said this in relation to the access issue%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%You agreed to provide %%dqt%%moral%%dqt%% ]^[ other support to [Professor] Fels in pursuit of access to the Foxtel cable network ]f[ C7 ]^[ the Olympics%%per%%]$~ 
~$[I will draft a letter to [Professor] Fels ]f[ your signature that outlines the issues from our perspective %%per%%%%per%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[We will need to ramp up activity on this issue to ensure its resolution in our favour over the next few months %%cmp_if%% you are to have sufficient time to negotiate advantageous arrangements ]f[ pay%%dsh%%per%%dsh%%view coverage of Olympic events%%sqt%%%%per%% 
1431 On about 5 August 1999%%lst%% Mr North entered into Terms of Engagement between himself ]^[ Seven Network ]^[ ACE%%per%%]$~ 
~$[That agreement was amended in December 1999%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The agreement%%lst%% as amended%%lst%% provided an annual fee %%sqt%% ]f[ provision of consulting ]^[ strategic advisory services %%sqt%%%%per%% 
10%%per%%3%%per%%2 Mr North%%sqt%%s Strategic Objectives 
1432 On 13 August 1999%%lst%% Mr North sent an email to Mr Stokes%%lst%% Mr Gammell ]^[ others concerning a discussion he had had with Mr Cassells of the ACCC%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr North reported in relation to the AFL pay television rights as follows%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%The ACCC expressed concern to PBL%%lst%% News Corp ]^[ Telstra at the time of the PBL %%dqt%%equalisation%%dqt%% with News Corp in Foxtel at the risk of them using their combined market power to lock up all major program ]^[ sporting rights%%per%%]$~ 
~$[They gave assurances (naturally) to the ACCC ]^[ said that there were good commercial reasons (? 
) why this would ]n[ happen%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The ACCC advised in its decision ]n[ to oppose the move that [it] would %%dqt%%subsequently monitor the market behaviour%%dqt%% of News ]^[ PBL in relation to program rights%%per%% 
[The ACCC] would be concerned at the acquisition by Foxtel of the AFL rights%%per%%]$~ 
~$[However the ACCC would need some HARD EVIDENCE (as discussed in my aide memoire ]f[ that meeting) that News%%lst%% PBL%%lst%% Telstra ]v[ other parties are colluding to take those rights from us%%per%%]$~ 
~$[We need to put together a paper trail of any correspondence%%lst%% affidavits of conversations etc%%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Stokes did ]n[ dispute that this advice had been given to him by Mr North at the time%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Thus at least 16 months before the AFL finally awarded the AFL broadcasting rights to News%%lst%% Mr Stokes had been advised of the need to gather evidence in support of a complaint to be made to the ACCC about anti%%dsh%%competitive conduct by News%%lst%% PBL ]^[ Telstra%%per%% 
1433 In August 1999%%lst%% Mr North prepared a document entitled %%sqt%% Seven Network Strategic Objectives %%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The document dealt%%lst%% among other matters%%lst%% with the AFL broadcasting rights%%lst%% access issues%%lst%% the anti%%dsh%%siphoning regime ]^[ the Olympics channels%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In relation to access%%lst%% Mr North prepared the following strategy%%cln%%

10%%per%%4 Seven Formally Seeks Access to the Telstra Cable 
1435 On 25 August 1999%%lst%% Seven formally requested the Foxtel Partnership ]^[ Telstra Multimedia%%lst%% pursuant to s 152AR(3) of the TP Act %%lst%% to supply Seven with broadcasting access services declared by the ACCC%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The letter stated that the request was made to enable Seven to provide three pay television broadcasting services%%per%%]$~ 
~$[One service was to commence no later %%cmp_ta%% 13 September 1999 ]^[ was to be supplied to subscribers on an ongoing basis%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The two remaining services were to operate from 13 September 2000 to 2 October 2000%%lst%% in order to provide coverage of the Sydney Olympic Games%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The letter also sought billing information in connection with matters associated with the supply of broadcasting services%%lst%% together with the use of %%sqt%% conditional%%dsh%%access equipment %%sqt%%%%per%% 
1436 The letter sought a response from Foxtel by 8 September 1999%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Although drafted by Seven%%sqt%%s solicitors%%lst%% the letter was signed by Mr Wood%%per%%]$~ 
~$[This appears to have been pursuant to Mr North%%sqt%%s strategy of having Seven sign the letter in order to %%sqt%% retain the semblance of a genuine attempt at reconciliation %%sqt%%%%per%% 
1437 On 30 August 1999%%lst%% Seven made further requests to Telstra Multimedia ]^[ to Foxtel ]f[ access to the Telstra Cable%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The requests were said to be made ]f[ the purpose of providing three pay television services on the basis previously outlined%%per%%]$~ 
~$[On the same day%%lst%% TARBS made a further request ]f[ 16 additional channels%%lst%% having originally requested eight channels in 1998%%per%% 
1438 Seven made further requests ]f[ access on 3 ]^[ 8 September 1999%%per%%]$~ 
~$[These were in substantially the same terms as the previous requests%%lst%% ]b[ were made in the event that earlier requests had ]n[ been validly made%%per%% 
10%%per%%5 A Declaration Is Made 
1439 In the meantime%%lst%% on 30 August 1999 the ACCC issued a media release stating that it had decided to declare pay television carriage services under Pt XIC of the TP Act %%per%%]$~ 
~$[This was said to confirm the ACCC%%sqt%%s earlier view%%lst%% outlined in its June 1999 draft report%%lst%% that it should declare such a service%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The ACCC said the declaration would promote competition ]f[ retail pay television services ]^[ was in the long%%dsh%%term interests of consumers%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The ACCC decided%%lst%% however%%lst%% ]n[ to declare a technology neutral pay television access service%%lst%% which would also have applied to digital broadcasting over cable%%per%%]$~ 
~$[This decision was said to reflect the fact that the deployment of digital technology ]^[ services was at an early stage%%per%% 
1440 The ACCC published a detailed report relating to its decision to declare the analogue subscription television broadcast service%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The declaration was gazetted on 8 September 1999%%per%% 
10%%per%%6 Telstra%%sqt%%s Response to Seven%%sqt%%s Strategy 
1441 Ms Lowes of Telstra was bemused by Seven%%sqt%%s strategy%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In an internal email of 25 August 1999%%lst%% she commented as follows%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%This is fascinating%%per%%]$~ 
~$[So are they proposing that we tell them where the customers are ]^[ they will sell a service that we will %%cmp_t%% bill?%%qsn%%]$~ 
~$[This is unlike any access declaration I have ever heard of%%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Two days later Ms Lowes%%lst%% in an internal email%%lst%% expressed support ]f[ the idea of meeting with Seven%%lst%% ]b[ added that she had been talking with Seven ]f[ some time ]^[ %%sqt%% I can pretty much guarantee that this is about putting C7 on FOXTEL %%sqt%%%%per%% 
1442 On 31 August 1999%%lst%% Ms Lowes informed colleagues within Telstra about a conversation she had had with Mr Gammell%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%1%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Seven wants C7 to be carried as a channel on Foxtel%%per%%]$~ 
~$[They are ]n[ looking ]f[ separate access to the HFC network%%per%%]$~ 
~$[They just see this as a way to push their way in %%per%%]$~ 
~$[They plan to send Telstra/Seven a separate term sheet on C7 which will offer Foxtel a price that is lower %%cmp_ta%% Fox Sports price by a certain percentage%%lst%% say 30%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[This will make ]f[ an interesting discussion at the Foxtel Board meeting%%per%% 
2%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Seven wants the Olympics to be carried as a special Pay per View on Tier channel on Foxtel%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In my view%%lst%% this should be very doable as Foxtel would ]n[ have to bear any short term cost burden%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Query what PBL ]^[ News will say here%%per%% 
3%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Peter [Gammell] says that they told [Minister] Alston that the issue was ]n[ Telstra%%sqt%%s fault ]^[ they saw Telstra as cooperative here%%per%% 
4%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Peter thinks that Fels got this one wrong%%lst%% ]b[ %%per%%%%per%%%%per%% that it could still be helpful to them%%sqt%%%%per%% 
(Emphasis added%%per%% 
) 
1443 On 5 ]^[ 6 September 1999%%lst%% an exchange of emails took place within Telstra concerning Seven%%sqt%%s access request%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Moriarty recorded that Telstra had been pressing at Foxtel Management board meetings ]f[ Foxtel to seriously consider C7%%lst%% ]b[ News ]^[ PBL %%sqt%% are emphatically opposed %%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[He considered that the legal position was %%sqt%% very clear cut %%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The legislation had grandfathered the entitlement of network owners to enter exclusive content deals ]s[ that the rights of the Foxtel Partnership ]^[ its %%sqt%% shareholders %%sqt%% were protected%%per%% 
1444 Ms Lowes%%lst%% who had been in regular contact with Mr Gammell%%lst%% assessed the position this way%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%The service that Seven wants is ]n[ Telstra%%sqt%%s %%dsh%%%%dsh%%%%dsh%% it is Foxtel%%sqt%%s%%per%%]$~ 
~$[They want to be on the Foxtel service%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In other words%%lst%% they do ]n[ want to acquire their own customers%%lst%% bill them%%lst%% etc%%per%%]$~ 
~$[They want Foxtel to do so%%per%%]$~ 
~$[And %%per%%%%per%%%%per%% as Gerry [Moriarty] correctly says %%per%%%%per%%%%per%%]$~ ~$[News ]^[ PBL%%lst%% ]^[ to a lesser extent%%lst%% Foxtel management do ]n[ want to take C7%%per%% 
%%per%%%%per%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Re Seven%%lst%% I have told Peter Gammell (Kerry Stokes%%sqt%%s 2IC) that we would like to have C7 on Foxtel%%lst%% ]b[ that News ]^[ PBL are preventing this%%per%%]$~ 
~$[He claims that he told Alston this%%per%% 
%%per%%%%per%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[C7 is harder %%dsh%%%%dsh%%%%dsh%% Tom [Mockridge] does ]n[ even want to contemplate a deal with Seven as he thinks that he might get the AFL directly%%per%%]$~ 
~$[He %%cmp_tf%% does ]n[ want to give C7 any leverage with the AFL to keep it%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Seven knows this to [sic] ]s[ %%per%%%%per%%%%per%% it is likely to get difficult%%sqt%%%%per%% 
1445 On 7 September 1999%%lst%% Mr Stokes wrote to Senator Alston%%lst%% the Minister ]f[ Communications%%lst%% Information Technology ]^[ the Arts%%lst%% expressing concern at reported comments of Dr Switkowski to the effect that Telstra was ]n[ bound by the ACCC%%sqt%%s declaration in relation to the Telstra Cable%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Stokes said it was his strong view that the Telstra Cable was a public asset ]^[ exclusivity of use was intended to be short%%dsh%%term%%per%%]$~ 
~$[He urged the Government to pursue any avenues available to it to ensure that Telstra complied %%sqt%% with the letter ]^[ the spirit of the telecommunications access regime %%sqt%%%%per%% 
1446 Mr Mockridge of Foxtel Management ]^[ Mr Rizzo of Telstra exchanged communications between 8 ]^[ 10 September 1999%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Mockridge complained of public comments by Telstra to the effect that it was open to commercial negotiations with parties concerning access to pay television%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Rizzo replied that the ACCC%%sqt%%s declaration had placed Telstra in a difficult position%%per%%]$~ 
~$[While Telstra did ]n[ wish to be seen as hostile to the ACCC%%cln%%

~$[In discussions regarding access%%lst%% Telstra has consistently maintained that our agreement with FOXTEL constrains Telstra from unilaterally offering access to the network ]f[ the provision of pay TV services%%lst%% ]^[ that any decision regarding new content on FOXTEL rests with the FOXTEL Board ]^[ management%%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Rizzo noted that as the interests of the three Foxtel partners might diverge on this issue%%lst%% Foxtel Management should form its own independent position%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Telstra Multimedia also responded to Seven%%sqt%%s requests on 9 September 1999%%lst%% asserting that it was neither a carrier nor a carrier service provider%%per%%]$~ 
~$[However%%lst%% Telstra Multimedia said that it would consider the issues further when it had the opportunity to do so%%per%% 
1448 Seven responded to Foxtel Management%%sqt%%s rejection on 10 September 1999%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The letter stated that Seven did ]n[ accept Foxtel%%sqt%%s protected contractual right contention ]^[ sought particulars of Foxtel%%sqt%%s claim%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Mockridge replied on 13 September 1999%%lst%% repeating the contention that Foxtel would be deprived of its protected contractual right %%cmp_if%% Telstra Multimedia were to grant cable access to a third party%%per%%]$~ 
~$[He also asserted that Telstra Multimedia was precluded by its contractual obligations to Foxtel from acceding to Seven%%sqt%%s access request%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Wood responded to Mr Mockridge%%sqt%%s letter on 15 September 1999%%lst%% disagreeing with Foxtel%%sqt%%s assertions%%per%%

~$[FOXTEL has been advised that the application would have reasonable prospects of success%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The FOXTEL Partners%%lst%% FOXTEL ]^[ Telstra Multimedia have received several access requests from Seven ]^[ TARBS%%per%%]$~ 
~$[FOXTEL has responded to those requests on the basis that it is ]n[ an access provider ]^[ in any event any grant of access would deprive FOXTEL of its protected contractual right%%sqt%%%%per%%

%%sqt%%The CEO advised FOXTEL%%sqt%%s intention to apply to the Federal Court ]f[ a review of the recent decision of the ACCC to declare analogue cable subscription services ]^[ the fact that this presented an opportunity ]f[ FOXTEL%%sqt%%s argument that it operates in a wider television market to be heard in the Federal Court%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The CEO indicated that the application would be in the name of FOXTEL only as Telstra were unwilling to join the proceedings at this stage%%lst%% although FOXTEL was receiving good co%%dsh%%operation from Telstra%%sqt%%s legal team on the matter%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The CEO referred to discussions with the Seven Network ]^[ advised that it was apparent from Seven%%sqt%%s actions that they had decided to pursue access via the access regime rather %%cmp_ta%% commercial negotiations with FOXTEL concerning FOXTEL%%sqt%%s distribution of the channels%%per%%]$~ 
~$[There was discussion of the AFL rights ]^[ Mr Falloon stressed the strategic importance of securing the rights%%sqt%%%%per%%

1522 Mr Ebeid also said that he did ]n[ believe at the time that pay television would be profitable ]f[ Optus in the short term%%lst%% although he agreed that increasing subscriber numbers would drive the sale of other products of CMM ]^[ thus improve its EBITDA position%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The following exchange %%cmp_t%% took place%%cln%%

~$[After summarising the terms of the arrangement%%lst%% Mr Wise observed that%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%the sleeper in this is that by 31 December they will have to accept ]^[ go to print on January ]^[ February programming%%lst%% ]s[ we have basically secured our minimum position of maintaining the contract until February %%sqt%%%%per%% 
1605 In a paper apparently prepared in early October 2001 ]f[ Seven%%lst%% Mr Wise reported that an agreement had been executed with Optus ]f[ a three month extension of the C7%%dsh%%Optus CSA%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Wise offered this comment%%cln%%

~$[However%%lst%% I am equally sure that they will want to renegotiate the terms in December/January%%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Three main proposals were considered during this period%%per%% 
1607 The first was the non%%dsh%%exclusive supply of Fox Sports to Foxtel on terms which would enable Fox Sports to supply its channels to Optus%%per%%]$~ 
~$[A proposal to this effect was sent by Mr Philip to Mr Sutton of Telstra on 17 August 2001%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It provided ]f[ a base price ]f[ residential subscribers of US$4%%per%%75 pspm%%per%%]$~

~$[For each year in which the channels included NRL coverage%%lst%% a %%sqt%% Flagfall Price %%sqt%% of $9%%per%%225 million applied%%per%% 
1608 The second proposal was ]f[ the exclusive supply of Fox Sports to Foxtel%%per%%]$~ 
~$[This proposal was analysed by Mr Sutton in an internal Telstra document of 18 September 2001%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Sutton understood the proposal to amount to US$5%%per%%44 pspm%%lst%% increasing annually by the CPI%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In addition%%lst%% $18 million per annum was payable ]f[ NRL coverage%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Sutton pointed out that the current arrangements provided a flat licence fee of US$5%%per%%25 pspm with no CPI increases%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The proposal was %%cmp_tf%% more expensive %%cmp_ta%% the current arrangements%%lst%% with the disparity increasing over time%%per%% 
1609 The third proposal%%lst%% embodied in a term sheet prepared by Mr Philip on 24 October 2001%%lst%% provided ]f[ the supply by Fox Sports to Optus of two channels%%cln%% an %%sqt%% NRL on Optus %%sqt%% channel ]^[ an unbranded channel containing general sports programming%%lst%% including some Fox Sports programs%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Foxtel was to receive the Fox Sports channels at a fee of US$2%%per%%65 plus $5%%per%%00 pspm%%lst%% with staged volume discounts cutting in at 250,000 ]^[ 1,000,000 subscribers%%per%%]$~ 
~$[An annual fee of $9%%per%%225 million was payable ]f[ NRL coverage%%per%% 
1610 The Foxtel partners were unable to reach agreement on any of these proposals%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The proposal ]f[ the non%%dsh%%exclusive supply of Fox Sports to Foxtel was rejected %%cmp_b%% it provided insufficient benefits to Telstra ]^[ required further measures to prevent churn from Foxtel (and Telstra%%sqt%%s telephony customers) to Optus%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Telstra rejected the terms ]f[ the exclusive supply of Fox Sports to Foxtel %%cmp_b%% it involved a significant increase in the fee payable by Foxtel under the %%cmp_t%% current arrangements%%per%%]$~

~$[Dr Switkowski described the substance of the meeting in his cross%%dsh%%examination%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%This was%%lst%% to me%%lst%% in fact a defining meeting where Telstra approached this with a degree of reluctance%%lst%% ]b[ %%cmp_if%% we could get bundling%%lst%% %%cmp_t%% we were prepared to give ground on other matters%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Then there was another theme introduced around%%lst%% well%%lst%% maybe this would %%cmp_t%% lead to including Optus in a broader arrangement%%lst%% leading to the formation of this ContentCo structure%%per%%]$~ 
~$[That was one of the subjects discussed on this occasion? 
%%dsh%%%%dsh%%%%dsh%% I believe so%%per%%]$~ 
~$[So you discussed Telstra bundling%%lst%% number one? 
%%dsh%%%%dsh%%%%dsh%% Yes%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Content rationalisation in the pay television industry? 
%%dsh%%%%dsh%%%%dsh%% Well%%lst%% really%%lst%% responding to the Optus approach that we merge our content agreements together ]^[ that Foxtel %%cmp_t%% takes responsibility ]f[ that%%sqt%%%%per%% 
1630 Dr Switkowski explained the position he took at the meeting in these terms (which I accept)%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%At the time of the 22 November 2001 meeting%%lst%% I was aware that %%cmp_if%% there was to be an agreement between Optus ]^[ FOXTEL%%lst%% FOXTEL (and through it Telstra ]^[ the other FOXTEL partners) would be required to assume Optus%%sqt%% liabilities to its content suppliers%%lst%% including onerous minimum subscriber guarantee %%per%%%%per%%%%per%% commitments%%per%%]$~

~$[I also thought that Telstra would benefit from a better relationship with its FOXTEL partners in dealing with future issues such as digitisation%%per%%]$~ 
~$[I considered that these benefits to Telstra outweighed the likely cost to Telstra of enabling Optus to bundle a more attractive pay television service with its telephony products while being freed of its burdensome content contracts ]^[ the cost to FOXTEL of funding Optus%%sqt%% MSG liabilities%%sqt%%%%per%% 
1631 Mr Akhurst%%sqt%%s explanation of his reasoning process at the time (which I also accept) was this%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%I weighed up the advantages ]^[ disadvantages of the proposals ]^[ formed the view that Telstra should support these proposals %%cmp_b%% the risks to Telstra of Fox Sports ]v[ FOXTEL supplying content to Optus were largely mitigated by Telstra itself being able to bundle FOXTEL%%lst%% ]^[ the advantage which Optus had of being able to bundle would be largely mitigated by Telstra%%sqt%%s ability to bundle%%per%%]$~ 
~$[I considered that the proposals were the best compromise Telstra would be able to achieve ]^[ it also meant that we would be able to reach a resolution about the Fox Sports supply price to FOXTEL which had been a source of tension amongst the FOXTEL partners ]f[ several years%%per%%]$~ 
~$[I also thought that the proposals would help improve the FOXTEL business%%lst%% %%cmp_b%% FOXTEL would also be distributed by Telstra ]^[ Optus%%lst%% ]^[ the FOXTEL partners could work more harmoniously to reach agreements in the future about issues such as digitisation of the FOXTEL service%%sqt%%%%per%%

~$[Either Project Alchemy ]v[ Manage ]f[ Cash avoided ]v[ deferred several hundred million dollars in exit costs%%per%% 
1709 The McKinsey paper described three %%sqt%% fundamental changes %%sqt%% to the %%cmp_t%% current operation of CMM that would be required %%cmp_if%% Manage ]f[ Cash were adopted%%per%% 
1710 Mr Lee explained in his statement that %%sqt%% stopping new adds %%sqt%% referred to a component of the Manage ]f[ Cash option%%lst%% to the effect that no new customers would be added to the Optus network%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The reference to improved telephony margins assumed that Telstra would follow Optus%%sqt%% pricing moves%%per%%

~$[However%%lst%% this statement was made in the context of comparing Project Alchemy with Manage ]f[ Cash on optimistic assumptions%%lst%% the comparison being favourable to Project Alchemy%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The McKinsey document as a whole does ]n[ suggest that it was likely that CMM would become a going concern under the Manage ]f[ Cash regime%%lst%% although it apparently regarded this outcome as a possibility%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Later%%lst%% McKinsey recorded that %%cmp_if%% CMM could ]n[ achieve the proposed plan (including the aggressive pricing improvements)%%lst%% it would have to close by 2006%%per%% 
1714 The management paper identified a key point that had been referred to at the previous board meeting%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%CMM division is currently sub scale%%lst%% suffers onerous content obligations%%lst%% is severely inhibited by network footprint ]^[ is exposed to rapid commoditisation of its telephony products%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In the absence of industry rationalisation%%lst%% all participants face a lack of scale ]^[ uneconomic content costs%%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The management paper explained the %%sqt%% network imprint %%sqt%% issue as follows%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%Currently CMM%%sqt%%s addressable market is limited to those serviceable homes which the HFC passes (2%%per%%2 Million of which 1%%per%%4 million is addressable)%%per%%]$~ 
~$[These [sic] leaves 4%%per%%4 million of 75% of the market unable to be addressed by the HFC network%%per%%]$~ 
~$[This limitation is major barrier to achieving scale economics ]f[ CMM%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It is also important to note that 80% of the CMM HFC network is overbuilt by Telstra%%lst%% thereby cutting the theoretical maximum penetration levels ]f[ CMM in those area%%sqt%%s [sic] in half due to competitive dynamics%%per%%]$~ 
~$[For example%%lst%% established overseas cable operators who have regional monopolies typically reach penetration levels of approximately 60%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In an overbuild situation with Telstra%%lst%% that maximum penetration would be approximately 30% (assuming 50% market share ]f[ each operator)%%per%%]$~ 
~$[All these footprint factors limit CMMs [sic] ability to achieve scale%%sqt%%%%per%% 
1715 The management paper pointed out that Project Emu had significant execution ]^[ deal structure risks%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It analysed the %%sqt%% Stand%%dsh%%alone (Steady State manage ]f[ cash) %%sqt%% option as follows%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%Historically the CMM division has had a cash burn rate of approximately A$300M per annum%%per%%]$~ 
~$[This strategy contemplates that the cash burn could be reduced to between A$100M ]^[ A$150M by stopping growth%%lst%% with a view to stalling any further decisions in relation to the CMM Division until such time that the PayTV ]^[ telephony industries have been rationalised (for example%%lst%% %%cmp_if%% ]^[ when regulators remove barriers to Optus accessing the local loop) at economically viable prices%%per%%]$~ 
~$[There is no certainty that either industry will be rationalised and%%lst%% even %%cmp_if%% they are%%lst%% there is risk that competitive pricing pressures may erode any profit potentials within those markets%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In the absence of any changes to content pricing this strategy%%lst%% this model will likely see CMM trading on in a negative cash flow situation ]f[ the foreseeable future%%per%%]$~ 
~$[This option has a 5 yr NPV (no TV) $260M%%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[As Mr Lee observed%%lst%% Optus management took a %%sqt%% slightly more pessimistic view of the potential outlook %%sqt%% %%cmp_ta%% had McKinsey%%per%% 
1716 The %%sqt%% Exit the Business %%sqt%% option was described as follows%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%This option involves Optus closing its CMM business ]^[ stopping the cashburn [sic]%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The shut down costs associated with exiting the CMM business include satisfying the minimum subscriber guarantees to content providers (current commitments have a $626M cash value)%%lst%% redundancies across the whole division ]^[ pulling down the HFC network%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The estimated cost of a total shut down is in the range of A$900M%%dsh%%A$1Billion%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In addition to the high exit costs there is inevitable brand damage ]^[ loss of growth options (such as eventual access to the local loop ]^[ vulnerability ]f[ Optus Mobile %%cmp_if%% convergence eventuates) which are difficult to quantify%%per%%]$~

11%%per%%24%%per%%4 Motives%%cln%% Mr Lee ]^[ Mr Anderson 
1720 Mr Lee gave evidence as to his state of mind at the board meeting of 21 February 2002%%lst%% as follows%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%I believed that the Manage ]f[ Cash option would continue to produce a negative cash flow%%per%%]$~ 
~$[I did ]n[ think that there was a realistic likelihood of economically viable prices in the CMM division%%per%%]$~ 
~$[I believed that the Manage ]f[ Cash option would result in continuing losses ]b[ at a lower level %%cmp_ta%% simply maintaining the status quo%%per%%]$~ 
~$[I regarded the Manage ]f[ Cash strategy as inevitably leading to Optus withdrawing from the pay television industry in due course ]f[ the following reasons%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The benefit of the strategy was that over time%%lst%% the MSG exit costs reduced dramatically%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The redundancy ]^[ close down costs also diminished over time%%per%%]$~ 
~$[By ]n[ seeking to attract any new pay television customers%%lst%% Optus%%sqt%% connection with pay television would quickly diminish%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Once the Manage ]f[ Cash strategy was adopted%%lst%% I believed that it would have become apparent to subscribers ]^[ investors alike that Optus was ]n[ committed to further investment in pay television%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In those circumstances%%lst%% I did ]n[ believe that the Manage ]f[ Cash strategy was one which could ]v[ should be pursued indefinitely%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Rather I believed that it was preferable to incur the exit losses relatively quickly ]^[ prevent a long ]^[ drawn out closure%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It was preferable to minimise that brand damaging process ]^[ to permit the company to concentrate its management resources on the profitable areas of the business%%sqt%%%%per%% 
1721 As at 21 February 2002%%lst%% from Optus%%sqt%% point of view%%lst%% there was a significant risk that Project Alchemy would ]n[ proceed ]v[ would have to be substantially modified%%per%% 
1722 The question of what Optus would have done %%cmp_if%% Project Alchemy did ]n[ proceed was %%cmp_tf%% ]n[ entirely theoretical%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Lee%%sqt%%s evidence as to SingTel%%sqt%%s likely course of action %%cmp_if%% Project Alchemy had ]n[ been available to Optus was this%%cln%% 
%%sqt%% If Project Alchemy at the end of February 2002 was ]n[ an option available to Optus/SingTel to pursue%%lst%% I would have recommended ]^[ supported the Manage ]f[ Cash option%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In my opinion%%lst%% that is the course which SingTel would have adopted%%per%%]$~ 
~$[If the Manage ]f[ Cash option had been adopted%%lst%% I would ]n[ have agreed to ]v[ recommended Optus agreeing to a further 3 year agreement with Seven/C7 to take a C7 sports channel which did ]n[ contain the Australian Football League %%per%%%%per%%%%per%% ]v[ the National Rugby League %%per%%%%per%%%%per%% ]f[ a total committed consideration of $54 million%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In my opinion%%lst%% SingTel would ]n[ have approved entry into such an agreement under the Manage ]f[ Cash option%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Such an agreement would involve committing Optus to a large additional MSG type payment whereas the Manage ]f[ Cash option was based on minimising expenditure%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Although I appreciated that the view submitted by Paul O%%sqt%%Sullivan ]^[ Michael Ebeid in the paper considered at the Management Committee meeting on 11 February 2002 as to the importance of a local content sports channel%%lst%% the Manage ]f[ Cash option did ]n[ involve attempting to attract any new subscribers%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The proposed C7 sports channel would ]n[ carry any major local sport%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Optus already had ESPN as a sports channel%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Committing Optus to a substantial sum ]f[ a sports channel with no local major sport would have been contrary to the Manage ]f[ Cash option%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Any loss of subscribers %%cmp_b%% of the absence of the C7 sports channel would ]n[ have concerned me in the Manage ]f[ Cash strategy%%sqt%% %%per%% 
1723 Mr Lee was pressed in cross%%dsh%%examination as to whether Optus%%lst%% in the event that Project Alchemy was unavailable%%lst%% would ]n[ have continued to pursue Project Emu%%per%%]$~ 
~$[His response was that%%lst%% although the board had directed that negotiations with Austar should continue in case Project Alchemy did ]n[ go ahead%%lst%% no decision had been made as to which of the two alternatives %%dsh%%%%dsh%%%%dsh%% Project Emu ]v[ Manage ]f[ Cash %%dsh%%%%dsh%%%%dsh%% was preferable%%per%%]$~

~$[MARKETS 
12%%per%%1 Introduction%%cln%% Expert Evidence 
1757 In this Chapter I address the questions of market definition raised by Seven%%sqt%%s pleadings ]^[ submissions%%per%%]$~ 
~$[These questions are of central importance to the case%%lst%% since Seven%%sqt%%s claims under s 45(2) of the TP Act depend on demonstrating that particular provisions ]v[ conduct had the purpose ]v[ likely effect of substantially lessening competition%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Market definition is also central to Seven%%sqt%%s case under s 46(1) of the TP Act %%lst%% that Foxtel took advantage of its substantial degree of market power ]f[ a proscribed purpose%%per%% 
1758 I have already commented on the fact that the parties adduced a great deal of expert evidence on the market questions%%lst%% much of it repetitive in character%%per%% 
1760 There is no dispute that each of the %%sqt%% competition experts %%sqt%% (as the parties described them) has considerable economics expertise and%%lst%% in particular%%lst%% is well qualified to express opinions on issues of market definition%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Nor has there been any suggestion that the experts were presenting other %%cmp_ta%% their honestly held opinions on the questions on which each was asked to comment%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Of course%%lst%% this has ]n[ prevented the parties from criticising trenchantly the reasoning process of the %%sqt%% opposing %%sqt%% experts ]v[ from endeavouring to demonstrate that the key assumptions underlying their respective opinions were flawed ]v[ unsupported by the evidence%%per%% 
1761 To a greater ]v[ lesser degree each of the experts made useful contributions to the debate%%lst%% although I found Professor Williams%%sqt%% evidence ]n[ to be of particular assistance%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Nonetheless%%lst%% the expert evidence%%lst%% although useful%%lst%% cannot determine the market definition questions I must address%%per%%]$~ 
~$[I explain later in this Chapter why there are limits to the utility of the expert evidence in this case%%per%% 
1762 I do ]n[ think it would be useful to summarise the evidence of each of the competition experts%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The better course is to refer to their evidence in the course of addressing the arguments made by the parties%%per%% 
12%%per%%2 Identification of Markets%%cln%% Principles 
12%%per%%2%%per%%1 Market Definition Is a Tool 
1763 Seven%%sqt%%s Closing Submissions sometimes give the impression of approaching the definition of the relevant markets as a separate issue%%lst%% largely distinct from the other issues in the case%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Yet the parties are agreed that markets are ]n[ defined in the abstract%%lst%% ]b[ ]f[ the purpose of analysing the processes of competition relevant to the allegations of anti%%dsh%%competitive conduct made in the particular case%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In Australian Competition ]^[ Consumer Commission v Liquorland (Australia) Pty Ltd [2006] ATPR 42%%dsh%%123%%lst%% Allsop J made the point%%lst%% supported by copious citation of authority%%lst%% that (at 45,243 [429])%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%Market definition is ]n[ an exact physical exercise to identify a physical feature of the world%%scn%% nor is it the enquiry after the nature of some form of essential existence%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Rather%%lst%% it is the recognition ]^[ use of an economic tool ]v[ instrumental concept related to market power%%lst%% constraints on power ]^[ the competitive process which is best adapted to analyse the asserted anti%%dsh%%competitive conduct%%sqt%%%%per%% 
1764 Similarly%%lst%% in a well%%dsh%%known passage%%lst%% cited (among many others) by the Full Federal Court in Australian Competition ]^[ Consumer Commission v Australian Safeway Stores Pty Ltd [2003] FCAFC 149 %%scn%% (2003) 129 FCR 339%%lst%% at 399 [293]%%lst%% Professor Maureen Brunt said this%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%It must be constantly borne in mind that market definition is ]b[ a tool to facilitate a proper orientation ]f[ the analysis of market power ]^[ competitive processes %%dsh%%%%dsh%%%%dsh%% ]^[ should be taken only a sufficient distance to achieve the legal decision%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The elaborateness of the exercise should be tailored to the conduct at issue ]^[ the statutory terms governing breach (or authorisation %%per%%%%per%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[There can be more %%cmp_ta%% one %%dqt%%relevant market%%dqt%% ]f[ a particular case%%lst%% in the sense of markets that will attract liability%%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[M Brunt%%lst%% %%sqt%%%%dqt%%Market Definition%%dqt%% Issues in Australian ]^[ New Zealand Trade Practices Litigation%%sqt%% (1990) 18 ABLR 86%%lst%% at 126%%dsh%%127 (hereafter %%sqt%% Market Definition Issues %%sqt%%)%%per%% 
1765 The same point was emphasised by Mason CJ ]^[ Wilson J in Queensland Wire Industries Pty Ltd v The Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd [1989] HCA 6 %%scn%% (1989) 167 CLR 177%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In that case%%lst%% the issue was whether BHP had misused its substantial degree of power in the steel ]^[ steel product market%%lst%% in contravention of s 46 of the TP Act%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Their Honours observed (at 187%%dsh%%188) that the%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%analysis of a s 46 claim necessarily begins with a description of the market in which the defendant is thought to have a substantial degree of power%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In identifying the relevant market%%lst%% it must be borne in mind that the object is to discover the degree of the defendant%%sqt%%s market power%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Defining the market ]^[ evaluating the degree of power in that market are part of the same process%%lst%% ]^[ it is ]f[ the sake of simplicity of analysis that the two are separated%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Accordingly%%lst%% %%cmp_if%% the defendant is vertically integrated%%lst%% the relevant market ]f[ determining degree of market power will be at the product level which is the source of that power %%per%%%%per%%%%per%%]$~ ~$[After identifying the appropriate product level%%lst%% it is necessary to describe accurately the parameters of the market in which the defendant%%sqt%%s product competes%%cln%% too narrow a description of the market will create the appearance of more market power %%cmp_ta%% in fact exists%%scn%% too broad a description will create the appearance of less market power %%cmp_ta%% there is%%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Similarly%%lst%% Deane J (with whom Dawson J agreed) said (167 CLR%%lst%% at 195) that in%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%the case of an alleged contravention of %%per%%%%per%%%%per%% s 46(1)%%lst%% there will ordinarily be little point in attempting to define relevant markets without first identifying precisely what it is that is said to have been done in contravention of the section%%sqt%%%%per%% 
12%%per%%2%%per%%2 Substitutability 
1766 Section 4E of the TP Act (reproduced in Ch 13) defines a market in terms that direct attention ]n[ merely to the goods ]v[ services of the alleged infringer%%lst%% ]b[ to goods ]v[ services which are %%sqt%% substitutable for%%lst%% ]v[ otherwise competitive with %%sqt%% them%%cln%% Rural Press Ltd v Australian Competition ]^[ Consumer Commission [2002] FCAFC 213 %%scn%% (2002) 118 FCR 236%%lst%% at 268%%dsh%%269 [111]%%lst%% per curiam%%per%% 
1767 The concept of a market ]f[ the purposes of competition analysis was explained by the Trade Practices Tribunal (of which Professor Brunt was a member) in Re Queensland Co%%dsh%%operative Milling Association Ltd (1976) 25 FLR 169 (%%sqt%% QCMA %%sqt%%)%%lst%% at 190%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%We take the concept of a market to be basically a very simple idea%%per%%]$~ 
~$[A market is the area of close competition between firms or%%lst%% putting it a little differently%%lst%% the field of rivalry between them%%per%% 
(If there is no close competition there is of course a monopolistic market%%per%% 
) Within the bounds of a market there is substitution %%dsh%%%%dsh%%%%dsh%% substitution between one product ]^[ another%%lst%% ]^[ between one source of supply ]^[ another%%lst%% in response to changing prices%%per%%]$~ 
~$[So a market is the field of actual ]^[ potential transactions between buyers ]^[ sellers amongst whom there can be strong substitution%%lst%% at least in the long run%%lst%% %%cmp_if%% given a sufficient price incentive%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Let us suppose that the price of one supplier goes up%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Then on the demand side buyers may switch their patronage from this firm%%sqt%%s product to another%%lst%% ]v[ from this geographic source of supply to another%%per%%]$~ 
~$[As well%%lst%% on the supply side%%lst%% sellers can adjust their production plans%%lst%% substituting one product ]f[ another in their output mix%%lst%% ]v[ substituting one geographic source of supply ]f[ another%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Whether such substitution is feasible ]v[ likely depends ultimately on customer attitudes%%lst%% technology%%lst%% distance%%lst%% ]^[ cost ]^[ price incentives%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It is the possibilities of such substitution which set the limits upon a firm%%sqt%%s ability to %%dqt%%give less ]^[ charge more%%dqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Accordingly%%lst%% in determining the outer boundaries of the market we ask a quite simple ]b[ fundamental question%%cln%% If the firm were to %%dqt%%give less ]^[ charge more%%dqt%% would there be%%lst%% to put the matter colloquially%%lst%% much of a reaction%%qsn%%]$~ 
~$[And %%cmp_if%% so%%lst%% from whom%%qsn%%]$~ 
~$[In the language of economics the question is this%%cln%% From which products ]^[ which activities could we expect a relatively high demand ]v[ supply response to price change%%lst%% i%%per%%e%%per%% 
a relatively high cross%%dsh%%elasticity of demand ]v[ cross%%dsh%%elasticity of supply? 
%%sqt%% 
1768 While this passage predated the enactment of s 4E of the TP Act in 1977%%lst%% it is regarded as a classic explanation of the concept of a market ]^[ has been approved by the High Court%%cln%% Queensland Wire 167 CLR %%lst%% at 188%%lst%% per Mason CJ ]^[ Wilson J%%scn%% Boral Besser Masonry Ltd v Australian Competition ]^[ Consumer Commission [2003] HCA 5 %%scn%% (2003) 215 CLR 374 (%%sqt%% Boral Besser %%sqt%%)%%lst%% at 413%%dsh%%414 [99]%%lst%% 422%%dsh%%423 [133]%%lst%% per Gleeson CJ ]^[ Callinan J (with whom Gaudron%%lst%% Gummow ]^[ Hayne JJ appeared to agree on this issue%%cln%% at 427 [155])%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It follows%%lst%% as Dawson J pointed out in Queensland Wire 167 CLR %%lst%% at 199%%lst%% that%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%[the] basic test involves the ascertainment of the cross%%dsh%%elasticities of both supply ]^[ demand%%lst%% that is to say%%lst%% the extent to which the supply of ]v[ demand ]f[ a product responds to a change in the price of another product%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Cross%%dsh%%elasticities of supply ]^[ demand reveal the degree to which one product may be substituted ]f[ another%%lst%% an important consideration in any definition of a market%%sqt%%%%per%% 
1769 In the present case%%lst%% Dr Smith explained the basic concept from an economic perspective in non%%dsh%%contentious terms%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%In defining the relevant market ]f[ the purpose of analysing possible competition issues%%lst%% the aim is to identify those buyers and/or sellers who constrain the pricing ]^[ production decisions of the firm (or supplier) whose conduct is alleged to raise competition concerns%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The firm%%sqt%%s decision%%dsh%%making will be constrained to the extent that buyers are willing to switch to other products and/or other producers are willing to offer an alternative product%%lst%% %%cmp_if%% the original supplier increases prices by a relatively small amount%%cln%% 
%%dqt%%%%per%%%%per%%%%per%% discretionary power rests upon an absence of close substitutes ]f[ the firm%%sqt%%s output%%lst%% either actually ]v[ potentially%%per%%]$~ 
~$[This means that market power ultimately rests upon two factors that act as constraints upon a firm%%sqt%%s business behaviour%%cln%% the numbers of (independent) firms ]^[ patterns of substitution ]f[ their products within an industry%%lst%% ]^[ the extent to which there are barriers to entry of new firms%%lst%% which would produce close substitute products%%lst%% from %%sqt%%outside%%sqt%% an industry (including the limbo of unborn firms)%%per%% 
%%per%%%%per%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Thus%%lst%% substitutability becomes the basic concept %%dsh%%%%dsh%%%%dsh%% in the economist%%sqt%%s sense%%dqt%%%%sqt%%%%per%% 
(Footnotes omitted%%per%% 
) 
(The quotation in this passage is from Market Definition Issues %%lst%% at 93%%per%% 
) 
1770 As Dawson J recognised in Queensland Wire %%lst%% a question of degree is involved in determining the point at which different goods ]v[ services became closely enough linked in supply ]v[ demand to be included in the one market%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In the same case%%lst%% Deane J accepted (167 CLR%%lst%% at 195%%dsh%%196) that the identification of relevant markets ]^[ the definition of market structures ]^[ boundaries%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%involves value judgments about which there is some room ]f[ legitimate differences of opinion%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The economy is ]n[ divided into an identifiable number of discrete markets into one ]v[ other of which all trading activities can be neatly fitted%%per%%]$~ 
~$[One overall market may overlap other markets ]^[ contain more narrowly defined markets which may%%lst%% in their turn%%lst%% overlap%%lst%% the one with one ]v[ more others%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The outer limits (including geographic confines) of a particular market are likely to be blurred%%cln%% their definition will commonly involve assessment of the relative weight to be given to competing considerations in relation to questions such as the extent of product substitutability ]^[ the significance of competition between traders at different stages of distribution%%sqt%%%%per%% 
12%%per%%2%%per%%3 In the Long Run 
1771 The passage cited from QCMA refers to strong substitution %%sqt%% at least in the long run %%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The temporal dimension of market definition was explained by the Trade Practices Tribunal (presided over by Deane J ]^[ including Professor Brunt) in Re Tooth Co Ltd ]^[ Tooheys Ltd (1979) 39 FLR 1%%lst%% at 38%%dsh%%39%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%It is plain that the longer the period allowed ]f[ likely customer ]^[ supplier adjustments to economic incentives%%lst%% the wider the market delineated%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In our judgment%%lst%% given the policy objectives of the legislation%%lst%% it serves no useful purpose to focus attention upon a short%%dsh%%run%%lst%% transitory situation%%per%%]$~ 
~$[We consider we should be basically concerned with substitution possibilities in the longer run%%per%%]$~ 
~$[This does ]n[ mean we seek to prophesy the shape of the future %%dsh%%%%dsh%%%%dsh%% to speculate upon how community tastes%%lst%% ]v[ institutions%%lst%% ]v[ technology might change%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Rather%%lst%% we ask of the evidence what is likely to happen to patterns of consumption ]^[ production were existing suppliers to raise price or%%lst%% more generally%%lst%% offer a poorer deal%%per%%]$~ 
~$[For the market is the field of actual ]v[ potential rivalry between firms%%sqt%%%%per%% 
1772 In Re AGL Cooper Basin Natural Gas Supply Arrangements [1997] ATPR 41%%dsh%%593%%lst%% the Australian Competition Tribunal (Lockhart J%%lst%% Dr Brunt ]^[ Dr Aldrich) pointed out (at 44,210) that the phrase %%sqt%% long run %%sqt%%%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%is to be read in a special technical sense as referring ]n[ to a span of years ]b[ to %%dqt%%operational time%%dqt%% as explained in Telecom Corporation of NZ Ltd v Commerce Commission (1991) 3 NZBLC |P99%%dsh%%239 at 102%%lst%% 363%%cln%% 
%%dqt%%We include within the market those sources of supply that come about from redeploying existing production ]^[ distribution capacity ]b[ stop short of including supplies arising from entirely new entry%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Thus %%sqt%%the long run%%sqt%% in market definition does ]n[ refer to any particular length of calendar time ]b[ to the operational time required ]f[ organising ]^[ implementing a redeployment of existing capacity in response to profit incentives %%dqt%%%%sqt%%%%per%%

12%%per%%2%%per%%4 Close Competition

~$[This is ]n[ the same thing as conduct that might have some effect on the behaviour of a particular firm%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%A vast number of firms might have some actual ]v[ potential effect on a defendant%%sqt%%s behaviour%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Many of them%%lst%% however%%lst%% will ]n[ have a significant effect ]^[ we attempt to exclude them from the relevant market in which we appraise a defendant%%sqt%%s power%%per%%]$~ 
~$[We try to include in the relevant market only those suppliers %%dsh%%%%dsh%%%%dsh%% of the same ]v[ related product in the same ]v[ related geographic area %%dsh%%%%dsh%%%%dsh%% whose existence significantly restrains the defendant%%sqt%%s power%%per%%]$~

1774 The same point was made by Dr Smith when she observed in her evidence that%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%just knowing that someone [in an industry] takes account of something %%cmp_e%% doesn%%sqt%%t actually mean it%%sqt%%s a close constraint on them%%per%%

12%%per%%3 Common Ground 
1776 There was no real dispute among the experts as to the principles relevant to the delineation of markets%%per%%]$~ 
~$[While they used different language and%%lst%% to some extent%%lst%% different sources%%lst%% they all accepted the principles that have already been summarised%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It is useful to record some additional common ground%%per%% 
1777 First %%lst%% the experts generally agree that the hypothetical monopolist test is the %%sqt%% standard analytical tool %%sqt%% in economic analysis ]f[ defining markets%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Professor Hay explained the test this way%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%Put simply%%lst%% we assume that all current producers of electric toothbrushes merge into one (or otherwise act as one) ]^[ ask whether the %%dqt%%hypothetical monopolist%%dqt%% could profitably increase ]v[ maintain prices above the competitive level by a %%dqt%%small ]b[ significant%%dqt%% amount ]f[ a sustained period of time%%per%%]$~ 
~$[If so%%lst%% %%cmp_t%% electric toothbrushes are a proper product market%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Both demand ]^[ supply side considerations can come into play when defining a market%%per%%]$~ 
~$[We can ask ]n[ only how many consumers of electric toothbrushes would over time switch to manual toothbrushes (cross%%dsh%%elasticity of demand) ]b[ also the extent to which producers of related products (such as electric drills) could ]^[ would (in response to the assumed higher prices ]f[ electric toothbrushes) convert some ]v[ all of their facilities to the manufacture of electric toothbrushes ]^[ would succeed in making sales (cross%%dsh%%elasticity of supply)%%sqt%%%%per%% 
(Footnotes omitted%%per%% 
) 
1778 Secondly %%lst%% as Professor Hay pointed out%%lst%% the standard analytical tool is often referred to as the %%sqt%% SSNIP test %%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[On this test%%lst%% as explained by Professor Noll a relevant market contains the producer of the benchmark product (a specific product that is produced by a particular firm)%%lst%% plus the smallest number of producers of other products such that%%lst%% %%cmp_if%% all these products were offered by a single firm%%lst%% the single seller could impose a %%sqt%% small ]b[ significant non%%dsh%%transitory increase in price %%sqt%% (%%sqt%% SSNIP %%sqt%%) above the competitive level%%per%%]$~ 
~$[To put the matter another way%%lst%% two products will be in the same relevant market %%cmp_if%% all producers of one of those products%%lst%% acting together%%lst%% could ]n[ profitably impose a SSNIP above the competitive level without losing sales to the producers of the other product%%per%%]$~ 
~$[A SSNIP is generally taken to be an increase of 5 to 10 per cent above the competitive level%%per%% 
1779 Thirdly %%lst%% as the previous paragraph implies%%lst%% the relevant price in applying the SSNIP test is the competitive price%%per%%]$~ 
~$[This is important %%cmp_b%% applying the test to the monopoly price results in an over%%dsh%%broad market definition%%per%%]$~ 
~$[This mistake is known among economists as the %%sqt%% cellophane fallacy %%sqt%% %%cmp_b%% the United States Supreme Court is usually said to have made the error in the Cellophane Case ( United States v E I du Pont de Nemours Co 351 US 377 (1956))%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Professor Noll explained the correct position this way%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%The role of competition in market definition is illustrated in the following example%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Suppose a firm is the sole producer of product A%%per%%]$~ 
~$[If this firm sets a monopoly price ]f[ A%%lst%% no further profit%%dsh%%increasing prices are feasible%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Consequently%%lst%% at the monopoly price consumers must be willing to switch their purchases to another product B %%cmp_if%% there is a further increase in A%%sqt%%s price%%per%%]$~ 
~$[At any lower price ]f[ A consumers prefer A to B%%lst%% ]^[ the producer of A can impose a profit%%dsh%%enhancing price increase%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Thus%%lst%% B is ]n[ in the relevant market ]f[ A %%cmp_b%% it does ]n[ prevent the producer of A from setting its price above the competitive level%%lst%% even though B is regarded as a substitute when A is sold at the monopoly price%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In competition analysis%%lst%% regarding A ]^[ B as in the same market is called the %%dqt%%cellophane fallacy%%dqt%%%%lst%% which refers to a U%%per%%S%%per%% court decision that found cellophane%%lst%% waxed paper ]^[ aluminium foil in a relevant market ]f[ flexible wrapping materials %%cmp_b%% at the prices prevailing in the market buyers would switch purchases among them %%cmp_if%% any one attempted to raise its price%%per%%]$~ 
~$[But one product (cellophane) was supplied by one company ]^[ was priced substantially above average cost%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Hence%%lst%% waxed paper ]^[ aluminium foil should ]n[ have been regarded as in the relevant market ]f[ cellophane %%cmp_b%% they did ]n[ force the price of cellophane to the competitive level%%sqt%%%%per%% 
(Footnotes omitted%%per%% 
) 
1780 Fourthly %%lst%% in a case involving buyers of products ]v[ of services%%lst%% the hypothetical monopolist test requires reference to the exercise of market power by a firm acting as a buyer%%lst%% ]n[ as a seller%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In this context%%lst%% it is necessary to consider the effect of a SSNRP%%cln%% %%sqt%% a small ]b[ significant non%%dsh%%transitory reduction in price %%sqt%% by a hypothetical monopsonist%%per%% 
(While this was ]n[ necessarily common ground among the economists at the outset%%lst%% it was ultimately ]n[ in dispute%%per%% 
) Professor Noll explained that%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%Monopsony is the mirror%%dsh%%image of monopoly%%lst%% ]^[ a firm that has the power to reduce price below the competitive level ]v[ to exclude other buyers from the market is a monopsonist%%sqt%%%%per%% 
1781 Fifthly %%lst%% there are four dimensions to a market%%cln%% product%%lst%% geographic%%lst%% functional ]^[ temporal%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Dr Smith quoted observations of Professor Brunt ( Market Definition Issues %%lst%% at 102)%%lst%% as follows%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%A market has product%%lst%% space%%lst%% function ]^[ time dimensions%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Between what set of products can customers ]^[ suppliers switch%%qsn%%]$~ 
~$[Within what geographic space %%qsn%%]$~ 
~$[Is the focus to be on the selling function ]v[ the buying function %%lst%% ]^[ how many levels ]v[ stages of production ]^[ distribution is it appropriate to distinguish in order to assess the scope ]f[ substitution through trade ]v[ potential trade%%qsn%%]$~ 
~$[Finally%%lst%% how much time is needed ]f[ customers ]^[ suppliers to make their adjustments in response to economic incentives%%qsn%%]$~ 
~$[An important practical consideration is that these dimensions may ]n[ be independent%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Thus%%lst%% ]f[ example%%lst%% geographic substitution may be alternative to%%lst%% ]v[ complementary with%%lst%% product substitution%%per%%]$~ 
~$[And the interdependence may be enhanced the longer the time period%%sqt%%%%per%% 
(Emphasis in original%%per%% 
) 
1782 These dimensions were described by Dr Smith%%lst%% again in non%%dsh%%controversial terms%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The geographic dimensions of the market are defined by reference to substitutability%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It is necessary to identify the appropriate levels in the supply chain in order to understand the competition implications of the conduct at issue%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In particular%%lst%% it is necessary to determine whether each level forms a separate market ]v[ whether two ]v[ more levels together form a single market (as where manufacturing ]^[ wholesaling form a single market %%cmp_b%% all manufacturers undertake wholesaling ]^[ there are no independent wholesalers)%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In general%%lst%% economists tend to regard a year ]v[ ]s[ as sufficient ]f[ assessing substitutability%%lst%% ]b[ when a new product is introduced a longer period may be needed to allow the market to adjust%%per%% 
(However%%lst%% this assessment of the relevant period may have to be modified in the light of the principles stated in the authorities%%cln%% ([1771]%%dsh%%[1772]%%per%% 
) 
1783 Sixthly %%lst%% the experts ]^[ the parties agree that there are separate markets ]f[ AFL broadcasting rights ]^[ NRL broadcasting rights in Australia%%per%%]$~ 
~$[However%%lst%% they disagree as to whether there are separate markets ]f[ AFL pay television rights ]^[ NRL pay television rights%%lst%% distinct from markets ]f[ AFL free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air television rights ]^[ NRL free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air television rights%%per%% 
12%%per%%4 Application of the SSNIP Test 
1784 The reliable application of the SSNIP test requires sufficient quantitative data to permit the calculation ]v[ assessment%%lst%% in particular%%lst%% of the competitive price ]f[ the product in question%%per%%]$~ 
~$[As has been seen%%lst%% it is the competitive price that provides the starting point ]f[ determining whether a hypothetical monopolist could profitably impose a SSNIP%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Whether ]v[ ]n[ it is ever possible to apply the test on the basis of purely quantitative data%%lst%% the experts agree that such an approach is ]n[ available in the present case%%per%% 
1785 Dr Smith explained her approach as follows%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%Pay TV has a relatively short history in Australia%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Further%%lst%% during the relevant period it is difficult to identify a competitive price ]f[ the purpose of applying a SSNIP%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The industry employs pricing arrangements that make it difficult to identify consistent pricing data in relation to a product of constant quality%%per%%]$~ 
~$[These data deficiencies mean that I will use a qualitative rather %%cmp_ta%% a quantitative approach to assess the extent of substitutability at each level in the industry supplying channels to Pay TV service providers%%sqt%%%%per%% 
(Footnotes omitted%%per%% 
) 
Professor Noll acknowledged in his oral evidence that he had ]n[ attempted to ascertain a competitive price in any of the markets he said existed%%per%% 
1786 In the absence of adequate pricing information%%lst%% the economists were thrown back on so%%dsh%%called %%sqt%% qualitative assessments %%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Dr Smith agreed that without quantitative data%%lst%% the SSNIP test %%sqt%% really in effect is an intellectual aid to focus the exercise %%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In economics%%lst%% this apparently can be described%%lst%% without Orwellian overtones%%lst%% as %%sqt%% a thought experiment %%sqt%%%%per%% 
1787 One consequence of the limitations of the SSNIP test (in the absence of quantitative data) is that in certain respects the economic evidence may ]n[ be as helpful as its volume (and the time spent on it in cross%%dsh%%examination) might suggest%%per%%]$~ 
~$[This is ]n[ to deny the value of economic evidence ]f[ certain purposes%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Plainly%%lst%% it can be very helpful in identifying ]^[ explaining the economic concepts embodied in the TP Act %%per%%]$~ 
~$[It can also be very helpful in explaining how economists go about the task of applying the economic concepts to particular situations%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The evidence is%%lst%% however%%lst%% apt to be less cogent when the experts are asked to apply economic principles to the particular circumstances of a case%%per%%]$~ 
~$[There are at least two reasons ]f[ this%%per%% 
1788 The first is that a %%sqt%% qualitative assessment %%sqt%% necessarily involves the exercise of judgment upon which reasonable minds can differ%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The sharp differences of opinion in this case among well%%dsh%%qualified experts demonstrate that this is so%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Moreover%%lst%% the exercise of judgment%%lst%% %%cmp_if%% the present case is any guide%%lst%% requires economists who may ]n[ have specialist expertise ]v[ experience in a particular industry to express their opinions about the application of economic principles to that industry%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Even %%cmp_if%% the witness has expertise ]v[ experience in the industry%%lst%% the lack of quantitative data may require what comes very close to speculation about the likely behaviour of industry participants%%lst%% although it may perhaps be described as informed speculation%%per%% 
1789 The second reason is that the qualitative assessments by the expert economists must proceed on the basis of assumed facts since%%lst%% in the ordinary course%%lst%% the facts have ]n[ ]y[ been established by the Court%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Like many competition cases%%lst%% the present case is extremely complex%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In order to deal with the complexities%%lst%% the parties deemed it appropriate to provide their respective experts with extraordinarily elaborate sets of assumptions upon which to base their evidence%%per%% 
1790 Seven%%lst%% ]f[ example%%lst%% prepared %%sqt%% Assumptions A %%sqt%%%%lst%% a document of some 350 pages%%lst%% of which no less %%cmp_ta%% five separate versions were supplied to various experts at various times%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Some%%lst%% ]b[ by no means all of the assumptions in Assumptions A were agreed between the parties%%lst%% as recorded in a sixth version of the document%%per%%]$~ 
~$[News prepared an additional set of assumptions%%lst%% designated %%sqt%% Assumptions B %%sqt%%%%lst%% comprising about 80 pages%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Two different versions of Assumptions B were supplied to the economic experts at different times%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mercifully the two quite distinct versions of News%%sqt%% %%sqt%% Assumptions C %%sqt%% were short%%lst%% while %%sqt%% Assumptions D %%sqt%%%%lst%% largely agreed between the parties%%lst%% deals with confidential material relating to the award of the AFL ]^[ NRL television rights in 2005%%per%% 
1791 The result is that the economists were asked to express their opinions on a range of questions on the basis of a mountain of material (the various assumptions incorporated references to a multitude of contemporaneous documents)%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Each of the experts did ]s[ with impressive diligence and%%lst%% ]f[ the most part%%lst%% demonstrated an equally impressive ability to recall during oral evidence the details of many transactions ]^[ events%%per%% 
1792 In the end%%lst%% however%%lst%% they were required to express opinions concerning the application of economic principles to an Australian industry with which none of them had detailed practical knowledge ]v[ experience%%per%%]$~ 
~$[As Dr Smith said in her evidence%%lst%% this process required them ]n[ only to take into account different assumptions%%lst%% ]b[ to interpret the common assumptions%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In addition%%lst%% the experts had to analyse ]^[ construe documents such as board papers%%lst%% emails ]^[ formal agreements%%lst%% some of which were the subject of extensive oral evidence%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It is %%cmp_tf%% perhaps ]n[ entirely surprising that they came to such divergent conclusions on market definition ]^[ other issues%%per%% 
1793 Professor Hay (whose reports were relatively brief) made some rather blunt comments that assist in placing the economic evidence in perspective%%per%%]$~ 
~$[He referred in his oral evidence to the fact that the experts had managed to produce over 700 pages of analysis on certain issues%%per%%]$~ 
~$[This observation led to the following exchange%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%HIS HONOUR%%cln%% Do I detect%%lst%% Professor Hay%%lst%% from your answers that you are ]n[ altogether sure that the 700 pages to which you refer are necessarily very helpful in resolving the issue [concerning the scope of the retail television market] that you have identified? 
%%per%%%%per%%%%per%% 
[PROFESSOR HAY:] You may find much of the material informative ]v[ entertaining ]v[ educational%%per%%]$~ 
~$[I did ]n[ find that it led me%%lst%% again having only perused it%%lst%% to be able to draw a firm conclusion on that issue%%per%%]$~ 
~$[And%%lst%% by the way%%lst%% that is exactly what I anticipated was the case when I started%%scn%% that even %%cmp_if%% I did that work%%lst%% I don%%sqt%%t think I would be able to resolve the problem%%sqt%%%%per%% 
1794 Conclusions on market definition cannot simply be reached by choosing between the expert opinions%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The task requires the application of the statutory criteria%%lst%% informed (as the authorities require) by economic principles%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Ultimately%%lst%% the conclusions must rest on an assessment of the evidence as a whole including%%lst%% where they are helpful%%lst%% the opinions ]^[ reasoning of the experts%%per%%]$~ 
~$[But the fact that ss 45 ]^[ 46 of the TP Act incorporate economic principles ]^[ concepts does ]n[ mean that the application of those principles to the facts is%%lst%% in effect%%lst%% to be delegated to the economists who are called to give their expert opinions%%per%% 
12%%per%%5 Evidence of Market Behaviour 
1795 Both parties invoke the principle that the best evidence of the dimensions of a market%%lst%% in the absence of a quantitative SSNIP test%%lst%% will often be from those who work in the relevant industries%%lst%% rather %%cmp_ta%% from economic theory%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Not surprisingly%%lst%% however%%lst%% they dispute the inferences that should be drawn from contemporary decisions ]v[ expressions of opinion by industry participants%%per%% 
1796 The general point has been made by Justice Heydon writing extra%%dsh%%judicially (J D Heydon%%lst%% Trade Practices Law (Lawbook Co%%lst%% Subscription Service)%%lst%% at [3%%per%%245])%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%The dimensions of a market are real%%lst%% ]n[ theoretical%%per%%]$~ 
~$[To define those dimensions the best evidence will come from the people who work in the market%%cln%% the marketing managers ]^[ salesmen%%lst%% the market analysts ]^[ researchers%%lst%% the advertising account executives%%lst%% the buyers ]v[ purchasing officers%%lst%% the product designers ]^[ evaluators%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Their records will establish the dimensions of the market%%scn%% they will show the figures being kept of competitors%%sqt%% ]^[ customers%%sqt%% behaviour ]^[ the particular products being followed%%per%%]$~ 
~$[They will show the potential customers whom salesmen are visiting%%lst%% the suppliers whom purchasing officers regularly contact%%lst%% products against which advertising is directed%%lst%% the price movements of other suppliers which give rise to intra%%dsh%%corporate memoranda%%lst%% the process by which products are bought%%lst%% what buyers must seek in terms of quantities%%lst%% delivery schedules%%lst%% price flexibility%%lst%% why accounts are won ]^[ lost%%sqt%%%%per%% 
1797 In the same paragraph%%lst%% Justice Heydon quotes from Sir Alan Neale%%lst%% The Antitrust Laws of the United States of America (2nd ed%%lst%% Cambridge University Press%%lst%% 1970)%%lst%% at 121%%lst%% a passage also quoted with approval by Allsop J in ACCC v Liquorland [2006] ATPR%%lst%% at [443]%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%The court will take as the market%%lst%% ]f[ the purposes of deciding cases%%lst%% just that market which the concern itself takes ]f[ its field of activity%%cln%% %%cmp_if%% a firm shows an intent to exclude competition from that field it will be assumed that the field sufficiently describes a market %%dsh%%%%dsh%%%%dsh%% ]f[ otherwise what would be the point of the effort to exclude? 
%%sqt%% 
1798 These general propositions are ]n[ in dispute%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It is%%lst%% however%%lst%% important to observe that contemporaneous conduct ]v[ expressions of opinion by market participants are often ambiguous on questions of market definition%%per%%]$~ 
~$[For example%%lst%% in a letter of 10 March 1999%%lst%% referred to by Mr Sumption in his opening submissions%%lst%% Mr Macourt referred to C7 ]^[ ESPN as %%sqt%% direct competitors of News %%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Seven equates News in this context with Fox Sports (of which News was the parent corporation at the time) ]^[ suggests that Mr Macourt%%sqt%%s comments show that he regarded C7 as a competitor of Fox Sports%%per%%]$~ 
~$[However%%lst%% it is ]n[ clear from the letter in what market Mr Macourt thought Fox Sports ]^[ C7 were competitors%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In his evidence%%lst%% Mr Macourt said that he regarded the free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air broadcasters as significant competitors%%lst%% suggesting that he may have been thinking of some kind of sporting rights market%%per%% 
1799 Seven also relies on a passage in Mr Macourt%%sqt%%s cross%%dsh%%examination%%lst%% as follows%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%[MR SUMPTION:] Did you in June 1998 have any particular entity in mind as being likely to offer competition to Fox Sports in the sports channel business? 
%%dsh%%%%dsh%%%%dsh%% I can only assume I would have thought SportsVision was a competitor at the time%%per%%]$~ 
~$[But you knew by June%%lst%% didn%%sqt%%t you%%lst%% that there was at least a question as to whether SportsVision would survive? 
%%dsh%%%%dsh%%%%dsh%% Yes%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Did you have in mind any potential competitor who might succeed SportsVision as a competitor to Fox Sports? 
%%dsh%%%%dsh%%%%dsh%% I don%%sqt%%t have a specific recollection%%lst%% ]b[ Mr Mockridge%%sqt%%s letter you referred to earlier identified Mr Weston as saying Seven was offering a service%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Yes%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Well%%lst%% I think what you are referring to is %%per%%%%per%%%%per%% the paragraph which says%%cln%% 
%%dqt%%The apparent %%sqt%%threat%%sqt%% that Weston used to extract the deal was that his alternative was to formulate a long term sports supply deal with Channel 7 which would lock%%dsh%%out Fox Sports from becoming the dominant supplier? 
%%dqt%% 
%%dsh%%%%dsh%%%%dsh%% Yes%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Now%%lst%% do you agree that from the very beginning of June it was apparent that the most likely source of competition to Fox Sports in the sports channel business was Seven ]v[ part of the Seven group? 
%%dsh%%%%dsh%%%%dsh%% Yes%%sqt%%%%per%% 
1800 I think it is correct%%lst%% as Seven submits%%lst%% that Mr Macourt was being asked in this particular passage ]f[ his view about competition to Fox Sports as a channel supplier rather %%cmp_ta%% as an acquirer of sporting content%%per%%]$~ 
~$[However%%lst%% I do ]n[ think that the questions were free from ambiguity%%lst%% especially as the passage follows a question in which Mr Macourt was asked to agree that %%sqt%% rights will cost more %%cmp_if%% there is competition %%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In any event%%lst%% Mr Macourt%%sqt%%s attention was ]n[ directed to the issue of close competition%%lst%% which is central to market analysis%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In particular%%lst%% his attention was ]n[ directed to the significance%%lst%% as he saw it%%lst%% of the different subscription driving content available ]v[ likely to be available on Fox Sports ]^[ on C7 as a successor to SportsVision%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Macourt%%sqt%%s evidence certainly has to be taken into account in determining whether Seven has established the existence of its pleaded wholesale sports channel market%%per%%]$~ 
~$[But the evidence is far from decisive ]^[ must be evaluated in its proper context%%per%% 
12%%per%%6 Purpose 
1801 In assessing market behaviour%%lst%% it is also very important to appreciate that Seven puts the alleged anti%%dsh%%competitive purpose of Foxtel ]^[ News at the forefront of its submissions on market definition%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Seven states%%lst%% correctly%%lst%% that the point of considering the existence ]v[ otherwise of particular markets is to assess the competitive implications of the acquisition by Foxtel of the AFL pay television rights ]f[ 2002 to 2006%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Seven %%cmp_t%% says that%%lst%% since its case is that the Consortium Respondents engaged in a series of actions designed to eliminate C7%%lst%% it is necessary to deal with the market issues having regard to the purpose it attributes to those parties%%per%% 
1802 Seven%%sqt%%s submissions reflect the close links between market definition questions ]^[ other issues in the case%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Having placed such emphasis on the anti%%dsh%%competitive purpose of %%sqt%% killing C7 %%sqt%%%%lst%% Seven%%sqt%%s market submissions have to be assessed in the light of my findings on the purpose of the Consortium Respondents%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Contrary to Seven%%sqt%%s contentions%%lst%% I find in Chapter 15 that none of the Consortium Respondents had the substantial purpose of killing C7%%per%%]$~ 
~$[While Mr Macourt ]^[ Mr Philip%%lst%% ]^[ perhaps others%%lst%% would have been content %%dsh%%%%dsh%%%%dsh%% even very pleased %%dsh%%%%dsh%%%%dsh%% to see the end of C7%%lst%% that was ]n[ the objective ]v[ end they sought to achieve in arranging Foxtel%%sqt%%s successful bid ]f[ the AFL pay television rights%%per%%]$~ 
~$[To use Seven%%sqt%%s own language%%lst%% the actions of the Consortium Respondents%%lst%% while aggressive ]^[ perhaps ruthless%%lst%% did ]n[ go beyond the %%sqt%% ordinary workings of vigorous competition %%sqt%%%%per%% 
1803 Seven%%sqt%%s market definition submissions%%lst%% particularly those relating to the wholesale sports channel market%%lst%% are permeated by the assumption that the Consortium Respondents engaged in the conduct in question ]f[ the purpose of destroying C7 as a competitor of Fox Sports ]v[ Foxtel%%per%%]$~ 
~$[My findings of fact %%cmp_e%%where in this judgment mean that the assumption is ]n[ soundly based%%per%%]$~ 
~$[That must be kept steadily in mind when considering Seven%%sqt%%s submissions in relation to the particular markets it propounds%%per%% 
12%%per%%7 AFL ]^[ NRL Pay Rights Markets 
1804 Seven pleads that there is ]^[ has been since at least November 1998 an AFL sports rights pay television market (%%sqt%% AFL Pay Rights Market %%sqt%%)%%lst%% being a market in Australia ]f[ the acquisition ]^[ supply of pay television rights to broadcast AFL matches (par 153)%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Seven says that the broadcasting rights to AFL matches are purchased by companies which either on%%dsh%%sell the rights to other companies ]v[ use the rights themselves in the course of making television broadcasts of AFL matches%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The Statement of Claim pleads an NRL sports rights pay television market (%%sqt%% NRL Pay Rights Market %%sqt%%) in comparable terms (par 154)%%per%% 
1805 As has been noted%%lst%% the parties are in agreement that%%lst%% from the perspective of a buyer of sports rights%%lst%% there are markets at least as narrow as an AFL broadcasting rights market ]^[ an NRL broadcasting rights market%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The question is whether each of these markets should be further subdivided into AFL pay rights ]^[ NRL pay rights markets%%lst%% separate from AFL free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air rights ]^[ NRL free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air rights markets%%per%% 
12%%per%%7%%per%%1 Seven%%sqt%%s Submissions 
1806 Seven contends that there are separate free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air ]^[ pay rights markets ]f[ each of the AFL ]^[ NRL%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It identifies the critical test as whether%%lst%% %%cmp_if%% all buyers of AFL ]v[ NRL pay rights acted as a single firm%%lst%% they could depress prices ]f[ the rights below the competitive level%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%The test is focused on the level of constraint which is likely to operate on a potential single purchaser of pay TV rights ]f[ either the AFL ]v[ NRL%%per%%]$~ 
~$[More specifically%%lst%% would the demand by FTA broadcasters ]f[ the FTA rights ]f[ the relevant code constrain the hypothetical single purchaser of the pay TV rights to a competitive price? 
%%sqt%% 
1807 Seven submits that the demand ]f[ free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air AFL ]^[ NRL broadcasting rights does ]n[ closely constrain the demand ]f[ the rights to broadcast on pay television%%lst%% ]f[ two reasons%%per%%]$~ 
~$[First%%lst%% the anti%%dsh%%siphoning regime gives free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air broadcasters an effective right of first refusal in respect of sporting events on the anti%%dsh%%siphoning list%%lst%% including AFL ]^[ NRL matches%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air operators%%sqt%% first right of refusal in relation to AFL ]^[ NRL broadcasting rights thus shields them from competition from pay television operators ]f[ those rights%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Seven relies on Professor Noll%%sqt%%s observation that %%sqt%% [t]he anti%%dsh%%siphoning rules prevent pay%%dsh%%TV from bidding on the first%%dsh%%choice live television rights in any time slot%%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Secondly%%lst%% the free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air networks have limited capacity to televise live sport%%lst%% no matter how popular the particular sport may be%%per%% 
1808 Seven rejects the Respondents%%sqt%% contention that the measures used in practice to %%sqt%% circumvent %%sqt%% the anti%%dsh%%siphoning regime (my word%%lst%% ]n[ the Respondents%%sqt%%) mean that free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air operators act as a constraint on any attempt by pay television operators to impose a SSNRP ]f[ the AFL ]v[ NRL pay television rights%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Seven%%sqt%%s Reply Submissions expressly disavow any reliance on breaches of the anti%%dsh%%siphoning provisions of the BS Act ]f[ the purposes of market definition%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Rather%%lst%% Seven contends that the effect of the regime as understood ]^[ applied by market participants %%lst%% gave free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air operators a first right of refusal in respect of the AFL ]^[ NRL broadcasting rights%%per%%]$~ 
~$[According to Seven%%lst%% the whole point of the anti%%dsh%%siphoning regime is to ensure that classic sporting events remain on free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air television ]^[ are ]n[ transferred to pay television %%sqt%% simply %%cmp_b%% of a higher bid %%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Moreover%%lst%% the AFL ]^[ the NRL Partnership would find the prospect of too many matches%%lst%% ]v[ the best matches%%lst%% being reserved ]f[ pay television most unattractive%%per%% 
1809 So far as capacity constraints are concerned%%lst%% Seven argues that each free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air broadcaster must have regard to opportunity costs when evaluating new programming%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The practical consequence is that each additional match will be less valuable to the free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air broadcaster %%cmp_ta%% the previous one %%cmp_b%% it will attract less advertising revenue ]^[ displace a more valuable programme%%per%%]$~ 
~$[As Professor Noll explained%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%The opportunity cost of the first televised AFL game on any channel is the profitability of the worst program that otherwise would be shown on the weekend%%per%%]$~ 
~$[As more games are broadcast%%lst%% the opportunity cost of that game increases %%cmp_b%% the program that must be dropped is a better program %%cmp_ta%% the previous programs that were dropped%%sqt%%%%per%% 
1810 Seven says that in the absence of major regulatory ]v[ structural changes%%lst%% such as permitting free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air multi%%dsh%%channelling%%lst%% there would be little prospect of free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air operators using all broadcasting rights either to the AFL ]v[ NRL%%lst%% notwithstanding that they have the benefit of the anti%%dsh%%siphoning regime%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Thus there will continue to be a set of %%sqt%% exclusive %%sqt%% rights available ]f[ acquisition by pay television operators%%lst%% being the residue matches ]n[ wanted by free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air operators%%per%% 
1812 The final point is reinforced%%lst%% ]s[ Seven argues%%lst%% by the experience in 2000%%lst%% when Foxtel bought the pay television rights%%lst%% in effect%%lst%% to the last three AFL matches in each round ]f[ $30 million per annum%%per%%]$~ 
~$[This was substantially more %%cmp_ta%% the price of $23 million per annum paid by Nine ]f[ the first three picks%%per%%]$~ 
~$[If Foxtel had offered less %%cmp_ta%% $30 million per annum ]f[ the pay television rights (that is%%lst%% less %%cmp_ta%% the assumed competitive price)%%lst%% the AFL could ]n[ have improved its position by offering more rights to free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air operators%%per%% 
1813 In summary%%lst%% Seven argues that%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%pay TV cannot compete with FTA ]f[ those matches which FTA seeks%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In respect of the balance%%lst%% FTA has little ]v[ no interest in the matches ]^[ thus pay TV is largely unconstrained in acquiring the rights to those matches%%per%%]$~ 
~$[As a consequence%%lst%% the acquisition of each set of broadcasting rights ought to be characterised as in separate markets%%lst%% as a pay TV monopsony will ]n[ be constrained by FTA to pay a competitive price ]f[ pay TV rights%%sqt%%%%per%% 
12%%per%%7%%per%%2 News%%sqt%% Submissions 
1814 News submits that Seven%%sqt%%s submissions (and expert evidence) frequently overlook the fact that the scope of the pay rights markets is in issue %%cmp_b%% of an alleged exercise of market power by buyers of sports rights%%lst%% ]n[ sellers%%per%% 
1815 News does ]n[ suggest that the latter is a feasible option ]f[ the AFL ]v[ the NRL pay television rights%%per%%]$~ 
~$[However%%lst%% News submits that the practical content of pay television rights%%lst%% in view of the anti%%dsh%%siphoning regime%%lst%% depends on which free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air operator acquires the rights ]^[ on the approach taken to the rights%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air ]^[ pay rights are %%sqt%% intertwined %%sqt%%%%per%%]$~

1816 According to News%%lst%% the correct market analysis%%lst%% ]f[ the purpose of addressing alleged anti%%dsh%%competitive conduct by a buyer of sports rights%%lst%% requires an assessment of what would occur %%cmp_if%% all of the free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air ]^[ pay television operators combined (the hypothetical monopsonist) ]^[ sought to reduce the price paid to the AFL ]v[ NRL ]f[ their respective broadcasting rights%%per%%]$~

1817 News %%cmp_t%% addresses the appropriate analysis to determine whether there are separate pay rights markets ]f[ each of the AFL ]^[ NRL%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It argues that the test is ]n[ (as Seven submits) whether demand by free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air broadcasters ]f[ the free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air rights ]f[ the relevant code constrains the hypothetical single purchaser of the pay television rights to a competitive price%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The test is rather whether demand by free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air broadcasters ]f[ broadcasting rights to the relevant code constrains the hypothetical single pay television purchaser of broadcasting rights to a competitive price%%per%%

~$[However%%lst%% News says that Seven%%sqt%%s experts wrongly assumed that the first pick of an AFL ]v[ NRL match by a free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air operator who has the right of first choice is necessarily the most valuable match%%per%%]$~

%%sqt%%(a) first%%lst%% there is no clearly defined boundary between %%dqt%%free to air%%dqt%% ]^[ %%dqt%%pay television%%dqt%% matches%%scn%%

1824 Despite the limitations I have identified as to the utility of %%sqt%% qualitative %%sqt%% expert evidence in defining markets%%lst%% both Seven ]^[ the Respondents rely heavily on the evidence of their respective experts%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It is quite clear from the evidence of Dr Smith ]^[ Professor Noll that the differences of opinion among the experts rest%%lst%% to a considerable extent%%lst%% on different assumptions about the operation of the anti%%dsh%%siphoning regime%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Both Dr Smith ]^[ Professor Noll assumed that the regime operates in a manner that eliminates%%lst%% ]v[ at least severely limits%%lst%% the opportunity ]f[ pay television operators to acquire exclusive rights to AFL ]v[ NRL matches of relatively high quality%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Both accepted that in the absence of the anti%%dsh%%siphoning regime%%lst%% AFL ]^[ NRL broadcasting rights would be sold into a single Australia%%dsh%%wide retail television market%%cln%% that is%%lst%% they accepted that in the absence of an anti%%dsh%%siphoning regime%%lst%% free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air rights buyers would act as a close constraint on a pay television monopsonist seeking to impose an SSNRP on the AFL ]v[ NRL as sellers of pay television rights%%per%% 
1825 Neither Dr Smith nor Professor Noll%%lst%% naturally enough%%lst%% offered a view as to the legality of what Seven described as the devices used to %%sqt%% circumvent %%sqt%% the anti%%dsh%%siphoning regime%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In any event%%lst%% as I have explained%%lst%% Seven does ]n[ rely on what it says is the illegality of the arrangements employed by some of the Respondents (and%%lst%% ]f[ that matter%%lst%% by Seven) to circumvent the anti%%dsh%%siphoning regime (an issue that is addressed in Chapter 21)%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Instead Seven looks to the practices actually adopted in relation to the bidding ]f[ broadcasting rights in support of its market definition case%%per%% 
1826 In these circumstances%%lst%% an important difficulty facing Seven becomes apparent from Professor Noll%%sqt%%s evidence%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In his reply report%%lst%% Professor Noll stated that under the anti%%dsh%%siphoning regime%%lst%% once free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air networks have acquired broadcasting rights%%lst%% pay television operators can acquire %%sqt%% subsidiary rights %%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[He expressed the view%%lst%% on the basis of the award of the AFL broadcasting rights in 2000%%lst%% that the AFL received a higher price ]f[ its pay television rights (quality ]^[ quantity adjusted) %%cmp_ta%% it received ]f[ its free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air television rights%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Professor Noll continued%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%Because the willingness to pay ]f[ additional FTA rights is declining in the number ]^[ quality of games that are made available%%lst%% the incremental price that FTA television networks would have been willing to pay ]f[ the rights that were acquired ]f[ pay TV must have been lower %%cmp_ta%% the prices they paid ]f[ the FTA rights that they did obtain%%per%%]$~ 
~$[This price in turn was lower %%cmp_ta%% the amounts paid by Foxtel%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Hence%%lst%% the willingness to pay of FTA ]f[ the rights that were acquired by Foxtel was ]n[ a binding constraint in determining the pay%%dsh%%TV prices%%lst%% ]s[ that competition by FTA can ]n[ prevent a small ]b[ significant%%lst%% non%%dsh%%transitory reduction in price ]f[ pay%%dsh%%TV rights%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Consequently%%lst%% a pay%%dsh%%TV service%%lst%% by avoiding the competition ]f[ rights that ensued in 2000%%lst%% has something to gain from becoming the only buyer in the future sale of pay%%dsh%%TV rights%%sqt%%%%per%% 
1827 Professor Noll%%lst%% after referring to the 2005 bidding ]f[ the AFL broadcasting rights by Nine ]^[ Foxtel%%lst%% said in his cross%%dsh%%examination that the critical question is whether parties could %%sqt%% contract around %%sqt%% the anti%%dsh%%siphoning regime in a fashion that caused a free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air broadcaster to be %%sqt%% simply a broker ]f[ a pay television service in procuring the rest of the rights %%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The following interchange %%cmp_t%% took place%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%[HIS HONOUR:] May I take it%%lst%% %%cmp_t%%%%lst%% from what you have said%%lst%% that underpinning your conclusion that there is a separate free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air rights market ]^[ a separate pay television sports rights market is the proposition that under the anti%%dsh%%siphoning regime%%lst%% as enforced in Australia%%lst%% pay television can get only what is left over after free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air has first choice in its own interests? 
%%dsh%%%%dsh%%%%dsh%% That%%sqt%%s right%%per%%]$~ 
~$[That is the crucial fact separating the experts in this case about market definition ]^[ also about substantial lessening of competition%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It is whether the anti%%dsh%%siphoning regime is sufficiently binding a constraint on pay television that they don%%sqt%%t really get what they want despite their willingness to pay%%per%%]$~ 
~$[That is something you agree that neither you nor the other economists have any particular expertise? 
%%dsh%%%%dsh%%%%dsh%% Exactly%%per%%]$~ 
~$[That is a legal conclusion%%lst%% ]^[ I%%sqt%%m afraid that%%sqt%%s your job%%lst%% ]n[ mine%%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Later in his evidence%%lst%% Professor Noll explicitly accepted that %%cmp_if%% he was wrong about the anti%%dsh%%siphoning rules affecting the allocation of broadcasting rights ]^[ their price%%lst%% he was also wrong about market definition%%per%% 
1828 The Respondents interpret Professor Noll%%sqt%%s evidence as conceding that %%cmp_if%% the contractual arrangements utilised in 2000 ]^[ 2005 to give the pay television operators greater certainty in relation to content were lawful (the so%%dsh%%called %%sqt%% circumvention measures %%sqt%%)%%lst%% this would also cause the market ]f[ pay ]^[ free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air television rights to be integrated%%per%%]$~ 
~$[I agree with Seven%%sqt%%s protest%%lst%% in its Reply Submissions%%lst%% that this interpretation misconstrues Professor Noll%%sqt%%s evidence%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Any concession made by him did ]n[ go that far%%per%%]$~ 
~$[He insisted that there would be an integration of the pay ]^[ free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air television rights markets only %%cmp_if%% Foxtel%%lst%% ]v[ any other pay operator%%lst%% were to be placed on an equal footing with the free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air broadcasters in relation to the selection of games to be broadcast on an exclusive basis%%per%% 
1829 Nonetheless%%lst%% it is clear enough that Professor Noll%%sqt%%s analysis proceeded on the assumption that the existing regime in practice prevents a pay television operator from bidding on first%%dsh%%choice live television rights in any timeslot%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It is ]f[ this reason that he referred to pay television as acquiring only %%sqt%% subsidiary rights %%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[He did ]n[ address in any detail the opportunity ]f[ pay television operators to negotiate ]n[ merely with the AFL ]v[ the NRL Partnership%%lst%% ]b[ with free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air broadcasters with a view to forming a bidding coalition%%per%%]$~ 
~$[As the evidence shows%%lst%% negotiations between free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air ]^[ pay broadcasters can open the way to an agreement concerning the ultimate award of pay television rights and%%lst%% more importantly%%lst%% the precise content of those rights%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The bargaining chip available to a pay television operator%%lst%% as Professor Hay pointed out%%lst%% is the pay television operator%%sqt%%s contribution to the consortium%%sqt%%s bid%%per%% 
1830 In Dr Smith%%sqt%%s first report%%lst%% she expressed the view that there are separate markets ]f[ free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air ]^[ pay AFL ]^[ NRL television rights%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Dr Smith reasoned that the rights available ]f[ pay television under the anti%%dsh%%siphoning regime are those ]n[ required by the free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air networks%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In effect%%lst%% %%cmp_tf%%%%lst%% the regime creates two categories of rights ]f[ sports on the anti%%dsh%%siphoning list%%cln%% one ]f[ free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air rights ]^[ the other ]f[ pay television rights%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Hence%%lst%% %%sqt%% demand is likely to be unresponsive to a SSNIP %%sqt%%%%per%% 
1831 News%%lst%% in my view%%lst%% justifiably criticised Dr Smith%%sqt%%s approach in her first report on the ground that she determined the boundaries of the sports rights markets as %%cmp_if%% the relevant issue was the power of the sellers of rights to raise prices above the competitive level%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Presumably ]f[ this reason%%lst%% she spent some time considering whether a SSNIP charged ]f[ the rights to a particular type of event would cause much supply side substitution between different types of events%%lst%% ]f[ example by creating a new Australian Rules competition%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The answer to that question does ]n[ assist in identifying the boundaries of the sports rights markets ]f[ the purpose of assessing the power of buyers of sports rights to depress prices below the competitive level%%per%% 
1832 In her reply report%%lst%% Dr Smith accepted that in a market where the allocation of rights results from competition between potential buyers%%lst%% the question is whether a seller of AFL ]v[ NRL broadcasting rights could defeat a negative SSNIP (SSNRP) on the part of a hypothetical pay television monopsonist%%lst%% by offering more rights to the free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air networks%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Rather confusingly%%lst%% she %%cmp_t%% said that it was inappropriate to apply a negative SSNIP test to determine the relevant market %%cmp_b%% the focus was on buying power%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Dr Smith said that the reason a negative SSNIP test could ]n[ be applied was %%cmp_b%% of the operation of the anti%%dsh%%siphoning rules%%lst%% which (as she understood it) meant that only rights ]n[ exercised by the free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air networks could become available ]f[ pay television%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In Dr Smith%%sqt%%s view%%lst%% the anti%%dsh%%siphoning regime operated in a manner similar to a government regulation partitioning a geographic area that might otherwise comprise a single geographic market%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%the anti%%dsh%%siphoning rules (if effective) mean that the FTA networks can obtain the rights they require with no effective competition from Pay TV%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In my opinion%%lst%% this results in separate markets ]f[ the AFL/NRL broadcast rights ]f[ FTA ]^[ ]f[ Pay TV%%sqt%%%%per%% 
1833 In cross%%dsh%%examination%%lst%% Dr Smith conceded%%lst%% perhaps a little reluctantly%%lst%% that her analysis was dependent on a %%sqt%% linear approach %%sqt%% %%dsh%%%%dsh%%%%dsh%% that is%%lst%% she acted on the assumption that the effect of the anti%%dsh%%siphoning regime was that the most attractive matches would go to free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air operators ]^[ pay television operators would be left with the residue of the least attractive matches%%per%%]$~ 
~$[She also conceded that it would be possible ]f[ a pay television operator to seek a coalition with a free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air operator in order to acquire more attractive games ]^[ that a free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air operator might have legitimate business objectives in forming ]v[ joining such a coalition%%per%% 
12%%per%%7%%per%%4%%per%%2 DOES PAY TELEVISION RECEIVE THE WORST MATCHES? 
1834 The assumption that pay television operators invariably receive the worst matches is reflected in Seven%%sqt%%s submissions%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The evidence does ]n[ support the validity of this assumption%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It is true that the successful News bid in 2000 ]f[ the AFL broadcasting rights%%lst%% supported by the Foxtel Put%%lst%% resulted%%lst%% broadly speaking%%lst%% in Foxtel obtaining the three least attractive AFL games%%lst%% although the form of the bid appears to have been influenced by the existence of Seven%%sqt%%s last right%%per%%]$~ 
~$[But other arrangements involving coalitions of rights buyers have contemplated pay television operators securing more attractive games%%lst%% effectively on an exclusively live basis%%per%% 
1835 Under the arrangements in place ]f[ the NRL broadcasting rights between 2001 ]^[ 2006%%lst%% Nine in fact had the first two choices from seven NRL matches each week%%lst%% while Fox Sports had the balance available ]f[ broadcast on pay television%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Although Nine had the first two picks (subject to the practical constraints imposed by the scheduling of NRL matches)%%lst%% it could ]n[ meaningfully be said that Fox Sports was simply left with an unattractive ]^[ unwanted residue%%per%%]$~ 
~$[After all%%lst%% it had five NRL matches available ]f[ broadcast live each week%%lst%% while Nine effectively could occupy only two time slots over a weekend of matches%%per%% 
1836 More importantly%%lst%% the bidding ]f[ ]^[ award of the NRL ]^[ AFL broadcasting rights in 2005 demonstrates that coalitions can be formed between one ]v[ more free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air operators ]^[ a pay television operator under which a bid%%lst%% %%cmp_if%% successful%%lst%% will result in the pay television operator acquiring rights to some attractive matches%%lst%% effectively on an exclusively live basis%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Some of the details of the arrangements entered into form part of the confidential evidence ]^[ it is ]n[ necessary to outline them in this section of the judgment%%per%%]$~ 
~$[They support the proposition that genuine bids were made that%%lst%% %%cmp_if%% successful%%lst%% involved a pay television operator being able%%lst%% in effect%%lst%% to make a selection of matches that could ]n[ reasonably be regarded as the unattractive residue of the free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air rights%%per%% 
1837 The point can be illustrated by the arrangements made in 2005 between Nine ]^[ Fox Sports in relation to the NRL broadcasting rights ]f[ 2007 to 2012%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Under these arrangements%%lst%% Nine had the first%%lst%% second ]^[ fifth pick of the eight matches in each round%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Fox Sports had the third ]^[ fourth picks ]^[ all matches ]n[ required by Nine%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In addition%%lst%% Nine nominated its time slots as 7%%per%%30 pm on Fridays%%lst%% 3 pm on Sundays ]^[ either a second Friday night game ]v[ a Monday night game%%per%%]$~ 
~$[However%%lst%% %%cmp_if%% Nine chose the Monday night game%%lst%% it had to pay substantial compensation to Fox Sports%%per%% 
1838 Seven%%sqt%%s Reply Submissions seem to accept that under the 2005 arrangements%%lst%% Nine did ]n[ obtain exclusive rights to the %%sqt%% best matches %%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In particular%%lst%% Nine did ]n[ obtain the third selection%%scn%% Fox Sports retained its position as the exclusive live NRL broadcaster on Saturdays%%scn%% ]^[ Fox Sports retained the Monday night slot unless Nine elected to pay Fox Sports substantial compensation%%per%% 
1839 Seven attributes the particular outcome to PBL%%sqt%%s common ownership of Nine ]^[ half of Fox Sports ]^[ News%%sqt%% half interest in each of Fox Sports ]^[ the NRL Partnership%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%In these circumstances%%lst%% it cannot be assumed that Nine is acting as a profit maximising entity to take advantage of its position as a free to air broadcaster acquiring an event on the anti%%dsh%%siphoning list%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Nor can the NRL be assumed to be acting in the best interests of a league to ensure that the best matches get the widest possible coverage%%sqt%%%%per%% 
1840 There is%%lst%% however%%lst%% no evidence that supports Seven%%sqt%%s submission that Nine was ]n[ acting as a profit maximising entity ]^[ that the NRL Partnership was ]n[ acting in the best interests of the NRL Competition%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Accordingly%%lst%% I do ]n[ accept the submission%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Whether ]v[ ]n[ Nine got %%sqt%%what it wanted %%sqt%% (whatever that means)%%lst%% as Seven suggests%%lst%% does ]n[ detract from the outcome%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Negotiations between a free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air operator ]^[ a pay television operator might result in the latter obtaining exclusive rights to %%sqt%% better %%sqt%% matches %%cmp_ta%% some of those taken by the free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air operator%%per%% 
1841 The point is further illustrated by the 2005 Nine%%dsh%%Foxtel bid ]f[ the AFL broadcasting rights ]f[ 2007 to 2011%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Seven seems to accept that%%lst%% had the bid succeeded%%lst%% Foxtel would have obtained an improved selection of AFL matches ]f[ broadcast on its pay television platform%%per%%]$~ 
~$[However%%lst%% Seven attributes the outcome to the fact that Foxtel was participating in a consortium with only one free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air broadcaster which had particular capacity constraints %%cmp_b%% of its ongoing commitment to NRL content%%per%%]$~ 
~$[But this explanation helps make out the Respondents%%sqt%% contention%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The precise terms of any arrangement between members of a bidding consortium will depend on a variety of circumstances%%lst%% including the free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air operator%%sqt%%s pre%%dsh%%existing commitments%%lst%% perceived viewer preferences%%lst%% likely advertising revenues%%lst%% the pay television operator%%sqt%%s assessment of the value of premium sporting events ]^[ many other factors%%per%% 
1842 Even where a bid ]f[ broadcasting rights was made in 2005 by a coalition of free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air operators (without the participation of an existing pay television operator)%%lst%% it was structured in a way that allowed rights to be sub%%dsh%%licensed to a pay television operator%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Depending on the outcome of negotiations between the successful free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air bidders ]^[ the pay television operator%%lst%% the latter might well be able%%lst%% in effect%%lst%% to select at least some of the more attractive AFL matches ]f[ broadcast exclusively live on pay television%%per%% 
1843 In my opinion%%lst%% the evidence supports PBL%%sqt%%s submission that%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%in 2000 ]^[ 2005 there was competition between ]^[ within bidding groups over%%cln%% the number of matches to be shown on free to air ]^[ pay television%%scn%% the rights to %%dqt%%pick%%dqt%% matches ]f[ broadcast%%scn%% time slots ]f[ broadcast (both over popular times ]^[ over %%dqt%%clean air%%dqt%%)%%scn%% exclusive ]v[ non%%dsh%%exclusive coverage of finals matches%%scn%% ]^[ the price to be paid ]f[ the bundle of rights%%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Indeed%%lst%% during negotiations in 2005 relating to the AFL broadcasting rights%%lst%% Seven itself proposed that Foxtel could enjoy %%sqt%% increased exclusivity %%sqt%% in return ]f[ an increased rights fee%%per%% 
1844 The experience in Australia demonstrates that in practice it is impossible at the outset of the bidding process ]f[ the AFL ]v[ NRL broadcasting rights to ascertain with certainty the content of the %%sqt%% pay rights %%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The precise content of the bundle of rights ultimately obtained by the pay television operator depends on negotiations between the rights holders ]^[ the various bidders%%lst%% as well as negotiations among bidding coalitions ]^[ within individual bidding coalitions%%per%%]$~

12%%per%%7%%per%%4%%per%%3 PROFESSOR HAY%%sqt%%S ANALYSIS 
1845 These conclusions lend support to Professor Hay%%sqt%%s analysis%%per%%]$~ 
~$[He argued in his first report that there is no externally imposed boundary between the number of matches shown exclusively on free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air television ]^[ the number shown exclusively on pay television%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The NRL ]^[ AFL can %%cmp_tf%% set the boundaries in a manner that maximises the overall value of the rights to them%%per%%]$~ 
~$[According to Professor Hay%%lst%% %%cmp_if%% a hypothetical pay television monopsonist attempted to restrict the quantity of pay television rights purchased from the NRL ]v[ AFL%%lst%% in order to drive down the price paid%%lst%% the NRL ]v[ AFL could shift the boundaries ]s[ that more matches are available to free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air%%per%%]$~ 
~$[More generally%%lst%% the NRL ]^[ AFL could establish contractual terms that provided an allocation of matches between free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air ]^[ pay television that maximised their revenues from the sale of television rights%%lst%% subject only to the anti%%dsh%%siphoning regime%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%since the ability of the NRL to engage in supply%%dsh%%side substitution (to FTA television operators) would constrain the ability of a hypothetical monopsonist of NRL [and AFL] pay TV rights to depress the price paid ]f[ those rights below the competitive level%%lst%% a market limited to the NRL [or AFL] pay TV rights is ]n[ justified%%sqt%%%%per%% 
1846 In cross%%dsh%%examination%%lst%% Professor Hay illustrated what he had in mind by reference to the 2005 bidding%%per%%]$~

~$[In other words%%lst%% the AFL ]^[ NRL could facilitate the shifting of rights between free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air ]^[ pay%%lst%% thereby allowing %%sqt%% fluidity to work itself out %%sqt%%%%per%%

~$[It is said to follow from this experience that competition from free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air operators ]f[ rights cannot prevent a SSNRP by a pay television operator%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air operators will simply ]n[ be prepared to pay enough%%per%%

~$[In any event%%lst%% as PBL points out%%lst%% there was no evidence as to the comparative prices on a quality adjusted basis%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Such an analysis would require consideration of such matters as the potential of the final series to drive advertising growth ]^[ the strategic importance of a network being identified with one of the premier Australian sports%%per%%]$~

~$[I prefer the analysis of Professor Hay who demonstrated a better grasp of the practical workings of the anti%%dsh%%siphoning regime%%per%% 
1853 Seven appears to argue that even %%cmp_if%% the reasoning of Professor Noll ]^[ Dr Smith is flawed%%lst%% the objective circumstances support the contention that free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air broadcasters could ]n[ constrain a pay television operator seeking to impose a SSNRP on a seller of AFL ]v[ NRL pay television rights%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Although ]n[ explicitly conceding flaws in the reasoning advanced by Professor Noll ]^[ Dr Smith%%lst%% Seven%%sqt%%s Reply Submissions seem to put an argument that assumes that their reasoning was indeed flawed%%per%% 
1854 It is true%%lst%% as Seven submits%%lst%% that the anti%%dsh%%siphoning regime%%lst%% as a practical matter%%lst%% gives a free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air broadcaster certain advantages in negotiating with a pay television operator ]v[ in dealing with the AFL ]v[ NRL in relation to the selection of matches%%per%%]$~ 
~$[However%%lst%% whether the advantages are important in determining the allocation of rights depends on the value the respective operators place on the particular matches ]v[ combination of matches%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Price cannot be eliminated from the equation%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Similarly%%lst%% it is true%%lst%% as Professor Noll suggested%%lst%% that a free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air broadcaster%%sqt%%s incremental willingness to pay ]f[ the right to broadcast additional matches each week will tend to decrease%%lst%% at least to some extent %%lst%% as a consequence of the opportunity costs which arise from capacity constraints%%per%%]$~ 
~$[But that does ]n[ mean that the price the free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air broadcaster is prepared to pay ]f[ any particular set of rights will be significantly less %%cmp_ta%% the price a pay operator should be prepared to pay ]f[ the same rights in a competitive market%%per%% 
1855 Seven%%sqt%%s case that a free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air broadcaster will ]n[ constrain a monopsonist purchaser of NRL ]v[ AFL pay television rights seeking to impose a SSNRP rests%%lst%% in my opinion%%lst%% too heavily on the experience with the allocation of the AFL broadcasting rights in 2000%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The experience of the rights bidding in 2005 suggests that general conclusions cannot be drawn from the earlier transaction ]v[ series of transactions%%per%%]$~ 
~$[On the contrary%%lst%% the more recent experience suggests that%%lst%% despite the concentrated nature of the buyers%%sqt%% market (however defined)%%lst%% broadcasting rights can be re%%dsh%%allocated among coalitions ]s[ as to constrain a pay television operator seeking to impose a SSNRP in respect of the rights it is prepared to acquire%%per%%

12%%per%%8 Wholesale Sports Channel Market 
12%%per%%8%%per%%1 The Issues 
1857 Seven pleads that there is ]^[ has been at least since November 1998 a wholesale sports channel market%%lst%% being a market ]f[ the wholesale acquisition ]^[ supply of channels consisting of sports programming ]f[ the providers of pay television services (par 145)%%per%% 
1858 The existence of the pleaded wholesale sports channel market is central to Seven%%sqt%%s case%%lst%% since it alleges that the acquisition of the AFL pay television rights in 2000 by News and%%lst%% consequently%%lst%% Foxtel led to a substantial lessening of competition in that market%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In particular%%lst%% Seven claims that by reason of Foxtel%%sqt%%s acquisition of the AFL pay television rights%%lst%% C7 was unable to compete with Foxtel ]^[ Fox Sports in the supply of pay television channels%%lst%% leaving Foxtel ]^[ Fox Sports as the only suppliers of channels which include %%sqt%% sports programming of a premium ]v[ marquee nature %%sqt%%%%per%% 
1859 The Respondents strenuously dispute the existence of the wholesale sports channel market as pleaded by Seven and%%lst%% at least in the case of News%%lst%% support their contention with elaborate ]^[ detailed arguments%%per%% 
(PBL%%sqt%%s submissions%%lst%% although adopting News%%sqt%% arguments%%lst%% were refreshingly succinct%%per%% 
) In essence%%lst%% their main contention is that the substitution possibilities between Fox Sports ]^[ C7%%lst%% on both the demand ]^[ supply side were limited%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Moreover%%lst%% any attempt to impose a supra%%dsh%%competitive price by a hypothetical monopolist of sports channels would be defeated by vertical integration backwards by the pay television platforms ]v[ forwards by the NRL Partnership ]v[ the AFL%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Naturally enough%%lst%% the Respondents%%sqt%% contentions provoked equally elaborate ]^[ detailed arguments in reply by Seven%%per%% 
1860 The analysis in this section as to the existence ]v[ otherwise of the wholesale sports channel market takes account of the arguments that have been put ]b[ does ]n[ explicitly address every contention advanced%%per%% 
12%%per%%8%%per%%2 Seven%%sqt%%s Submissions 
1861 Seven submits that there can be no doubt that C7 ]^[ Fox Sports were competitors at the material times%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It argues that the question of market definition should be informed by findings made in relation to Seven%%sqt%%s purpose case%%lst%% since this sheds light on the perception of News%%lst%% PBL ]^[ the other parties as to the likely consequences of their actions%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Those actions%%lst%% ]s[ it is alleged%%lst%% were designed to bring about the demise of C7%%per%%]$~ 
~$[As I have recorded%%lst%% I have rejected Seven%%sqt%%s purpose case%%per%% 
1862 According to Seven%%lst%% a hypothetical merger of Fox Sports ]^[ C7 would create a firm with significant market power%%lst%% having the capacity to raise the price of its services beyond the competitive level ]v[ to reduce the price of its inputs (sports rights) below the competitive level%%per%%]$~ 
~$[For example%%lst%% Fox Sports in 1998 projected a significant increase in rights fees in 1998 ]^[ developed a strategy to acquire rights to combat C7%%sqt%%s entry into the market place%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In particular%%lst%% Telstra %%sqt%% benchmark[ed] %%sqt%% Fox Sports against C7 ]^[ put pressure on Foxtel to consider taking C7 instead of Fox Sports%%lst%% thereby demonstrating that C7 was a real constraint on Fox Sports%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Internal Telstra documentation demonstrates that its officers regarded C7 as Fox Sports%%sqt%% key competitor ]^[ that C7 was an alternative to the Fox Sports channels on the Foxtel platform%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Optus sought to obtain the Fox Sports channels by threatening to %%sqt%% breathe life %%sqt%% into C7%%per%%]$~ 
~$[For example%%lst%% Mr Macourt agreed in evidence that in mid%%dsh%%1998%%lst%% it was apparent that the most likely source of competition to Fox Sports in the sports channel business%%lst%% following the collapse of SportsVision%%lst%% was part of the Seven group%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Similarly%%lst%% in November 2000 an internal Telstra document recorded a view of Telstra management that the effect of the proposed AFL pay television rights acquisition would be to enable Fox Sports to extract monopoly profits%%per%% 
1863 Seven answers the Respondents%%sqt%% %%sqt%% backwards integration %%sqt%% argument by contending that the possibility of a pay television broadcaster moving into the production of an input (sports channels) does ]n[ establish that two functional levels (a retail platform ]^[ channel supply) should be treated as a single market%%lst%% unless the efficiencies of integration are overwhelming%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The fact that Foxtel was the only retail platform to be vertically integrated in this sense (through the Fox Footy Channel) shows that the efficiencies were ]n[ overwhelming%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In any event%%lst%% the suggestion that the response to a hypothetical monopolist imposing a SSNIP would be backwards integration lacks an empirical basis%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The conduct of Foxtel in creating the Fox Footy Channel should be understood as the product of overlapping proprietorial interests in Foxtel ]^[ Fox Sports and%%lst%% more colourfully%%lst%% as %%sqt%% the stunted misbegotten progeny of parents with conflicting commercial interests %%sqt%%%%per%% 
1864 Seven submits that Professor Hay%%sqt%%s suggestion that an attempted monopolisation could be defeated by the AFL ]^[ NRL integrating forwards is pure supposition%%lst%% unsupported by any empirical evidence in Australia%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In any event%%lst%% such a move would be difficult ]^[ risky ]^[ involve significant sunk costs%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Any potential new entrant to the wholesale sports channel market%%lst%% ]f[ example a free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air operator%%lst%% would perceive ]^[ encounter many difficulties%%per%%]$~ 
~$[These include the fact that sports rights are available only every five years ]v[ ]s[ ]^[ are on the anti%%dsh%%siphoning list%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The hypothetical entrant may have to join a bidding coalition and%%lst%% in any event%%lst%% would face the prospect%%lst%% %%cmp_if%% successful%%lst%% of having to deal with a dominant Foxtel in order to exploit the pay rights%%per%% 
1865 These arguments ]^[ others were developed by Mr Sumption in his final oral submissions%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Sumption argued that although premium subscription driving content is commercially necessary ]f[ a sports channel supplier%%lst%% such content is ]n[ sufficient to establish a viable business%%per%%]$~ 
~$[A channel requires a broader range of programming%%lst%% in particular to fill the off%%dsh%%season schedule (in this case%%lst%% summer)%%per%%]$~ 
~$[He pointed out that the AFL%%dsh%%only channel%%lst%% the Fox Footy Channel%%lst%% was ]n[ a success%%lst%% in part at least %%cmp_b%% it had no fresh summer sports programming%%per%% 
1866 Mr Sumption contended that the mere existence of Fox Sports%%lst%% C7 ]^[ other sports channels such as ESPN shows that there was a market ]f[ the supply of such channels%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Furthermore%%lst%% ]s[ he argued%%lst%% pay television broadcasters in practice bought channels from suppliers instead of compiling the channels themselves%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Even %%cmp_if%% pay television broadcasters could move into channel%%dsh%%making%%lst%% it would merely demonstrate that there were lower barriers to entry to the wholesale sports channel market%%lst%% ]n[ that there was no market%%per%% 
1867 Mr Sumption contended that%%lst%% in any event%%lst%% an entrant into the market would have to reckon with the close association between Fox Sports ]^[ Foxtel%%per%%]$~ 
~$[An entrant would know that %%sqt%% half the retail market would probably be closed to him%%lst%% irrespective of the merits of his product %%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[At best%%lst%% a new entrant could expect to sell to Foxtel only %%sqt%% at a prodigiously loss%%dsh%%making price %%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Sumption referred to the modelling conducted within News suggesting that a higher price could be charged by a channel supplier with a practical monopoly%%lst%% by selling to all three pay platforms%%per%%]$~ 
~$[He contended that the models did ]n[ take into account the possibility that Optus ]^[ Austar would circumvent the monopoly supplier by producing their own channels%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Sumption also relied on Optus%%sqt%% decision in January 2001 to take NRL programming from Fox Sports%%lst%% rather %%cmp_ta%% exercise its entitlement to obtain the rights directly from the NRL Partnership%%per%%]$~ 
~$[At no point%%lst%% ]s[ he argued%%lst%% had Optus contemplated setting up its own channel%%per%% 
12%%per%%8%%per%%3 News%%sqt%% Submissions 
1868 News submits that the question posed by Seven%%sqt%%s allegations is whether the exit of C7 led to an increase in the market power of Fox Sports ]^[ Foxtel as suppliers of sports channels%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The primary focus must %%cmp_tf%% be on the close constraints on Fox Sports as a supplier of sports channels%%per%%]$~ 
~$[C7%%lst%% which depended primarily on AFL content%%lst%% was ]n[ substitutable ]f[ Fox Sports%%lst%% which included NRL content ]^[ a variety of other sports such as Rugby Union%%lst%% English Premier League soccer ]^[ international tennis%%per%%]$~ 
~$[To draw such a conclusion%%lst%% without first identifying the competitive price%%lst%% has the potential to fall foul of the Cellophane fallacy%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The only opportunity ]f[ Fox Sports to become a substitute ]f[ C7 was by acquiring the AFL pay television rights when they became available in 2000%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Likewise%%lst%% in order ]f[ C7 to become a substitute in supply ]f[ Fox Sports%%lst%% it would have had to acquire the NRL pay television rights when they became available%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The opportunity ]f[ sports channel providers to derive monopoly rents was likely to be lost to the entities that sell the premium sports rights that in turn constitute the source of the power to charge high prices%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Monopoly rents are likely to end up in the hands of the AFL ]^[ NRL%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Channel suppliers may charge a high price%%lst%% ]b[ it is ]n[ a monopoly price%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The price merely reflects the cost of an essential input%%per%% 
12%%per%%8%%per%%4 PBL%%sqt%%s Submissions 
1869 PBL submits that the alleged wholesale sports channel market is ]n[ relevant to resolving the competition issues raised by Seven%%sqt%%s case%%per%%]$~ 
~$[That question%%lst%% according to PBL%%lst%% is relevant to the existence of a sports rights market%%lst%% ]n[ a wholesale sports channel market%%per%%]$~ 
~$[This is %%cmp_b%%%%cln%% 
%%dsh%% an attempt to impose a supra%%dsh%%competitive price by a hypothetical monopolist of sports channels would be defeated by vertical integration by pay television platforms ]v[ by the AFL ]v[ the NRL Partnership%%scn%%

12%%per%%8%%per%%5 Correct Question 
1870 The existence of the wholesale sports channel market pleaded by Seven is an issue in the proceedings primarily %%cmp_b%% Seven contends that Foxtel%%sqt%%s acquisition of the AFL pay television rights ]^[ Fox Sports%%sqt%% acquisition of the NRL pay television rights increased the market power of Fox Sports ]^[ Foxtel as the suppliers of sports channels ]^[ substantially lessened competition in the market%%per%%]$~ 
~$[As I have noted%%lst%% market definition is a tool to facilitate analysis of the processes of competition ]^[ of market power%%per%%]$~ 
~$[That being the case%%lst%% the focus%%lst%% as Dr Smith agreed%%lst%% must be on the close constraints on Fox Sports as a supplier of sports channels to pay television platforms during the period 1998 to 2000%%per%% 
1871 This basic proposition%%lst%% while uncontentious%%lst%% is important %%cmp_b%% Seven%%sqt%%s submissions often depart from it%%per%%]$~ 
~$[At various points in its argument (and in various ways) Seven contends that C7 acted as a constraint on Fox Sports in relation to the acquisition of sports rights%%lst%% particularly the AFL ]^[ NRL pay television rights%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In a key paragraph of its Closing Submissions%%lst%% Seven asserts that the market definition question is%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%whether a merger of C7 ]^[ Fox Sports would create a firm with significant market power%%per%%]$~ 
~$[That would ]n[ be ]s[ %%cmp_if%%%%lst%% as the Respondents%%sqt%% experts suggest%%lst%% the merged firm would be ]s[ closely constrained by the pay TV retailers%%lst%% rights owners ]^[ FTA networks that it would have no capacity to reduce the price of inputs (rights) ]v[ raise its prices%%per%%]$~ 
~$[On the other hand%%lst%% evidence suggesting that a merged firm could either reduce the price of rights %%lst%% ]v[ could raise the price of its services to pay TV retailers%%lst%% in each case even %%cmp_if%% only to a small extent%%lst%% would indicate that sports channels like C7 ]^[ Fox Sports were a separate market%%sqt%%%%per%% 
(Emphasis added%%per%% 
) 
1872 Seven%%sqt%%s submissions proceed to address this question%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Consequently%%lst%% its submissions contain many references to evidence that is said to show that C7 constrained Fox Sports as an acquirer of sports rights%%lst%% rather %%cmp_ta%% a supplier ]v[ acquirer of channels%%per%%]$~ 
~$[For example%%lst%% as I have noted%%lst%% Seven relies on evidence suggesting that Fox Sports projected significant increases in rights fees as a result of the entry of C7 as a channel supplier in 1998%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Similarly%%lst%% Seven points to a Fox Sports budget prepared in mid%%dsh%%2000 which recorded that C7%%sqt%%s ]^[ ESPN%%sqt%%s competition ]f[ Australian pay television rights had served to inflate costs at a rate far in excess of the CPI%%per%% 
1873 Whether C7 ]^[ Fox Sports (or%%lst%% ]f[ that matter%%lst%% ESPN) competed ]f[ sports rights may be significant in determining whether there is a market ]f[ the sale ]^[ acquisition of particular sports rights ]v[ sports rights in general%%per%%]$~ 
~$[But it has little ]v[ no bearing on whether there is a wholesale sports channel market in which the sellers are compilers of sports channels ]^[ the buyers are pay television platforms with retail subscribers%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The correct question%%lst%% as PBL submits ]^[ Seven%%sqt%%s experts confirmed%%lst%% is whether a hypothetical monopolist of the supply of sporting channels could sustain a price to pay television platforms above the competitive level ]f[ a non%%dsh%%transitory period%%per%% 
1874 Some of Seven%%sqt%%s submissions are directed to the correct question%%per%%]$~

12%%per%%8%%per%%6 Seven%%sqt%%s Dilemma 
12%%per%%8%%per%%6%%per%%1 PLEADINGS%%cln%% MARQUEE SPORTS 
1875 Seven%%sqt%%s pleaded case puts two alternative propositions in relation to the significance of sports programming ]f[ pay television platforms%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The first%%lst%% which is pleaded in the context of the wholesale sports channel market%%lst%% is that%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%sports channels are distinct from ]^[ ]n[ substitutable with channels which contain other types of programming%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In order to operate a viable television service in Australia%%lst%% it is necessary to have attractive Australian sports programming as a subscription driver%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It is ]n[ possible to substitute other types of channels ]f[ sports channels%%lst%% %%cmp_b%% the pay television service will fail to attract sufficient subscribers to render it a viable service%%sqt%% (par 145(d)) %%per%%]$~ 
~$[The barriers to entry in the wholesale sports channel market are said to include long%%dsh%%term contractual entitlements to the pay television rights to attractive sports programming (par 146(c))%%per%%]$~ 
~$[According to the particulars provided by Seven%%lst%% the long%%dsh%%term contractual commitments include those relating to the AFL%%lst%% the NRL%%lst%% elite Rugby Union%%lst%% the English FA Premier League soccer ]^[ the World Swimming Championships%%per%% 
1876 The second alternative appears in the section of the Statement of Claim dealing with the effect of lessening competition in the various markets%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Seven alleges (par 161A) that%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%since at least November 1998%%lst%% in order to reach sufficient critical mass to be economically viable%%lst%% it is important that a retail pay television operator in Australia%%lst%% seeking to obtain material market share%%lst%% has access to a sports channel that incorporates a %%dqt%%must have%%dqt%% ]v[ %%dqt%%major%%dqt%% sport known as a %%dqt%%marquee sport%%dqt%%%%lst%% as%%cln%% 
(a) marquee sports are distinguished%%lst%% in part%%lst%% by the depth ]^[ spread of their appeal to consumers%%lst%% viewers ]^[ subscribers%%lst%% in part%%lst%% by social ]^[ cultural factors and%%lst%% in part%%lst%% by the greater utility they provide to retail pay television operators%%scn%% 
(b) the most important single factor driving pay television subscriptions is live ]^[ exclusive coverage of marquee sports%%scn%% 
(c) marquee sports overcome consumer inertia ]^[ are frequently the catalyst ]f[ a consumer to make a decision to subscribe to pay television%%scn%% 
(d) the value of marquee sports in building a network ]^[ a subscriber base means that their value to retail pay television operators extends beyond directly attributable cash flows%%scn%% 
(e) the only premium sports in Australia which provide consumers%%lst%% viewers ]^[ subscribers with sufficient depth%%lst%% intensity%%lst%% ]^[ strength of live coverage at recurrent%%lst%% predictable%%lst%% concise ]^[ regular times convenient to both the broadcaster ]^[ the audience that can be characterised as marquee sports are the AFL ]^[ the NRL%%sqt%%%%per%%

~$[The pleading is as follows%%cln%%

12%%per%%8%%per%%6%%per%%2 WHICH ALTERNATIVE? 
1878 Seven%%sqt%%s pleading creates a dilemma on the question of whether there is a wholesale sports channel market in the terms it advances%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The dilemma is that the more Seven stresses the unique character of each of exclusive AFL ]^[ NRL content as subscription drivers%%lst%% the more difficult it is to see a channel containing exclusive AFL live content as a close substitute ]f[ a channel containing exclusive NRL content%%per%%]$~ 
~$[No doubt it is in theory possible to have two forms of subscription driving content that appeal largely to the same audiences (and indeed Mr Sumption submitted that this was the position in fact)%%per%%]$~ 
~$[But %%cmp_if%% each channel containing separate subscription driving content appeals to a largely discrete audience ]v[ potential audience%%lst%% it may be very difficult to conclude that one channel supplier can closely constrain the other %%cmp_if%% it attempts to impose a SSNIP%%per%% 
1879 Early in its Closing Submissions%%lst%% Seven reiterates its pleading that a pay television operator must have access to material that includes a marquee sport ]^[ that the only marquee sports in Australia are the AFL ]^[ NRL%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The primary forensic reason ]f[ Seven%%sqt%%s emphasis on the unique attractions of AFL ]^[ NRL content is clear enough%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Its case is that once C7 was locked out of the AFL ]^[ NRL pay television rights in 2000%%lst%% the channel was doomed%%per%% 
1880 It would be very difficult%%lst%% %%cmp_if%% ]n[ impossible%%lst%% ]f[ Seven%%sqt%%s case to succeed %%cmp_if%% neither live AFL nor live NRL content was indispensable to C7%%sqt%%s survival%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Similarly%%lst%% Seven%%sqt%%s case that the acquisition by the consortium of the AFL pay television rights in 2000 substantially reduced competition in the wholesale sports channel market rests on the proposition that other suppliers of sports channels in Australia (ESPN%%lst%% TAB ]^[ others) %%sqt%% do ]n[ provide significant competition to Foxtel ]v[ Fox Sports in the supply of pay TV sports channels %%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Hence Seven relies on Mr Frykberg%%sqt%%s evidence (among others) to submit that%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%AFL ]^[ NRL are the most important content ]f[ the purpose of driving subscriptions to a pay TV platform%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Further %%per%%%%per%%%%per%% the AFL ]^[ NRL were the only sporting contests potentially available to C7 which were capable of rendering C7 (or any new entrant) sufficiently attractive to platforms to be potentially viable as a premium sports channel%%sqt%%%%per%% 
(Emphasis added%%per%% 
) 
1881 Seven does ]n[ merely submit that the only marquee sports in Australia are the AFL ]^[ NRL%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In support of its claim that there are separate AFL ]^[ NRL pay rights markets%%lst%% Seven emphasises the %%sqt%% substantial complementarity of the two sporting codes %%sqt%%%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%The AFL ]^[ the NRL appeal to predominantly different groups of supporters (with some overlap)%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Therefore they are ]n[ close substitutes in demand by pay TV operators %%lst%% %%cmp_b%% the pay TV operators are seeking to attract both groups of supporters as subscribers ]^[ %%cmp_tf%% would prefer to have both the AFL ]^[ NRL%%per%%

)%%sqt%% (Emphasis added%%per%%

It is particularly this emphasis on the substantial complementarity of the two sporting codes (in the sense used by Seven) that creates in my opinion the dilemma ]f[ Seven in relation to the existence of the wholesale sports channel market%%per%% 
12%%per%%8%%per%%6%%per%%3 AFL AND NRL AS MARQUEE SPORTS 
1882 Seven puts at the forefront of its submissions the proposition that there are only two marquee sports in Australia%%lst%% in the sense of major pay television subscription drivers%%cln%% the AFL ]^[ the NRL%%per%%]$~ 
~$[While Seven%%sqt%%s enthusiasm ]f[ this proposition seems to waver occasionally%%lst%% it is at the heart of Seven%%sqt%%s case%%per%%]$~ 
~$[For that reason%%lst%% ]^[ also %%cmp_b%% the proposition is significant ]f[ Seven%%sqt%%s contention that there is a wholesale sports channel market%%lst%% it is necessary to consider whether the AFL ]^[ the NRL are indeed marquee sports broadly in the sense propounded by Seven%%per%%]$~

12%%per%%8%%per%%7 A Premium Sports Channel Market? 
1898 The logic of Seven%%sqt%%s insistence on the existence of only two marquee sports would seem to be that there is a premium sports channel market in Australia%%lst%% comprising only channels that offer exclusive live AFL ]v[ NRL content%%per%%]$~

~$[Indeed%%lst%% as I have noted%%lst%% Seven expressly pleads that there is now no significant competition to Foxtel ]^[ Fox Sports in the supply of pay television sports programming %%cmp_b%%%%cln%%

1899 Professor Noll concluded that sports channels were in a separate market from non%%dsh%%sports channels that are also subscription drivers%%lst%% a conclusion that seems to be common ground%%per%%]$~ 
~$[However%%lst%% Professor Noll also concluded that the relevant market is ]f[ premium sports channels%%per%%]$~ 
~$[He regarded a channel as a %%sqt%% premium sports channel %%sqt%% %%cmp_if%% a substantial number of potential subscribers would acquire a pay television service only %%cmp_if%% it contained access to that channel ]v[ another like it%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Seven%%sqt%%s Closing Submissions acknowledge that Professor Noll described the relevant market %%sqt%% slightly differently %%sqt%% from Seven%%sqt%%s pleaded market%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Seven submits that the difference is immaterial %%cmp_b%% Professor Noll in his reply report included within his premium sports channel market ESPN ]^[ Sky Racing %%lst%% just as Seven does in its pleaded wholesale sports channel market%%per%% 
1900 This submission is ]n[ entirely convincing%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Professor Noll included within the category of premium sports in Australia ]n[ merely the AFL ]^[ NRL (Seven%%sqt%%s %%sqt%% marquee sports %%sqt%%) ]b[ other sports such as cricket%%lst%% Rugby Union ]^[ English Premier League soccer%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Professor Noll put forward three criteria ]f[ determining whether other channels compete with %%sqt%% benchmark premium sports channels %%sqt%%%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%first%%lst%% whether other sports channels are substitutes ]f[ it in attracting subscribers to the pay%%dsh%%television service%%scn%% second%%lst%% whether other types of premium channels are substitutes ]f[ premium sports channels%%scn%% and%%lst%% third%%lst%% whether other channels can add major sports events to offer a competitive substitute ]f[ an established premium sports channel%%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[He did not%%lst%% however%%lst%% explain why ESPN ]^[ Sky Racing satisfy these criteria%%lst%% being content to assume %%sqt%% conservatively %%sqt%% that both are premium sports channels%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It may be that Professor Noll regarded their offerings as premium sports or%%lst%% alternatively%%lst%% that he was prepared to assume that the channels could add premium sports content ]^[ thus compete with an established premium sports channel (there was evidence that ESPN might have been considering acquiring Australian sporting content in about 1998)%%per%%]$~ 
~$[If Professor Noll intended the latter%%lst%% an issue would arise as to why other channels%%lst%% including those with predominantly non%%dsh%%sporting content%%lst%% could ]n[ also satisfy the criteria%%per%% 
1901 In the end%%lst%% there may be little conceptual difference between Seven%%sqt%%s wholesale sports channel market%%lst%% which in substance includes channels offering %%sqt%% attractive Australian sports programming %%sqt%%%%lst%% ]^[ Professor Noll%%sqt%%s premium sports channel market%%lst%% which includes channels carrying an apparently wider range of so%%dsh%%called premium sports%%lst%% specifically ESPN ]^[ Sky Racing %%per%%]$~ 
~$[But there is clearly a substantial difference between Seven%%sqt%%s category of %%sqt%% marquee sports %%sqt%% in Australia ]^[ Professor Noll%%sqt%%s category of %%sqt%% premium sports %%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Indeed%%lst%% his understanding of the scope of premium sports is at odds with the concept of marquee sports which underlies the way Seven has presented its case%%per%% 
12%%per%%8%%per%%8 Seven%%sqt%%s Experts 
1902 Professor Noll%%sqt%%s concept of premium sports may be difficult to reconcile with Seven%%sqt%%s emphasis on the peculiar %%cmp_if%% ]n[ unique attributes of AFL ]^[ NRL content as subscription drivers ]f[ Australian pay television%%per%%]$~ 
~$[But his concept of premium sports does ]n[ necessarily affect Seven%%sqt%%s contention that C7 acted as a close constraint on Fox Sports (and Foxtel) as a supplier of sports channels%%per%%]$~ 
~$[However%%lst%% another aspect of Professor Noll%%sqt%%s reasoning sharpens the dilemma confronting Seven%%per%% 
1903 Like the other experts%%lst%% Professor Noll concluded that the AFL ]^[ NRL pay television rights are sold in separate markets%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In his view%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%[the] most popular team sports sell their television rights in separate relevant markets %%cmp_b%% the audiences ]f[ these games are substantially non%%dsh%%overlapping %%sqt%%%%per%% 
(Emphasis added%%per%%

Professor Noll pointed to evidence that the AFL ]^[ NRL appeal primarily to audiences in different regions%%lst%% the AFL being much more popular in the southern States ]^[ Western Australia%%lst%% while the NRL is much more popular in New South Wales ]^[ Queensland%%per%%]$~ 
~$[According to Professor Noll%%lst%% the regional nature of the interest was supported by differential advertising revenue from AFL free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air matches shown in different areas of Australia%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Professor Noll said that the justification ]f[ concluding that the AFL ]^[ the NRL Partnership sell their rights in different markets is%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%the evidence that each separately is a subscription driver%%lst%% ]^[ that the effect of each on subscriptions is additive %%sqt%%%%per%% 
(Emphasis added%%per%% 
) 
1904 As News correctly submits%%lst%% Professor Noll did ]n[ explain why%%lst%% %%cmp_if%% the AFL ]^[ the NRL Partnership sell their rights into different markets ]f[ the reason he gave %%lst%% pay television channels containing AFL ]^[ NRL live programming are ]n[ supplied to pay television operators in separate markets%%per%%]$~ 
~$[To put the point another way%%lst%% Professor Noll did ]n[ explain why%%lst%% on the assumptions underlying Seven%%sqt%%s case as to marquee sports%%lst%% C7 would constrain Fox Sports from imposing a SSNIP ]v[ could otherwise be regarded as a close competitor of Fox Sports%%per%%]$~ 
~$[If the AFL ]^[ NRL are separately subscription drivers ]^[ have a cumulative effect on the revenue of pay television broadcasters %%cmp_b%% they appeal to different audiences (the position Seven itself adopts)%%lst%% it would seem to follow that an AFL sports channel supplier would be unlikely to constrain a SSNIP by an NRL sports channel supplier%%per%% 
1905 Dr Smith%%sqt%%s evidence seems to present even more substantial difficulties ]f[ Seven%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In her first report%%lst%% she expressed the view%%lst%% on the basis of market research ]^[ other material%%lst%% that a relatively small number of sports%%lst%% ]b[ particularly the AFL ]^[ NRL Competitions%%lst%% are sufficiently differentiated from other sports with respect to popularity %%sqt%% ]^[ %%cmp_h%% subscriber appeal %%sqt%% that buyers of rights are unlikely to respond to a SSNIP%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%Although economists are concerned with responses at the margin%%lst%% preferences as between particular sports (especially football codes) are likely to be ]s[ strong%%lst%% given the strong attachment to the particular sport ]^[ especially to the particular team%%lst%% that any marginal change will be small %%dsh%%%%dsh%%%%dsh%% such a change would be unlikely to cause many soccer fans to watch less soccer ]^[ more AFL live broadcasts ]^[ ]s[ retail Pay TV suppliers ]^[ channel suppliers are unlikely to alter their demand ]f[ rights%%sqt%%%%per%% 
1906 Yet%%lst%% when addressing the product dimensions of the market%%lst%% Dr Smith also expressed the view that %%cmp_if%% a particular sports channel imposes a SSNIP on a retail pay television platform%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%there is likely to be sufficient potential response from other suppliers of sports channels to make [the] SSNIP unprofitable%%sqt%%%%per%% 
1907 Dr Smith acknowledged that substitutability is less certain on the demand side %%cmp_b%% sports channels tend to be complementary%%lst%% in the sense that they are differentiated in content%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Even so%%lst%% she thought it commercially realistic%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%to identify sports channel supply rather %%cmp_ta%% supply of programming relating to a particular sport%%lst%% %%cmp_b%% even though retailers may seek a sports channel with a primary focus on a particular sport%%lst%% the content will need to be broader %%cmp_ta%% just that sport%%sqt%%%%per%% 
1908 This analysis does ]n[ explain why%%lst%% in view of Dr Smith%%sqt%%s conclusions as to the differentiation between the appeal of AFL ]^[ NRL (geographically ]^[ on the basis of supporter allegiance)%%lst%% a SSNIP charged to pay platforms by%%lst%% say%%lst%% Fox Sports (with NRL content) would be rendered unprofitable by competition from C7 (with AFL content)%%per%%]$~

%%sqt%%[HIS HONOUR]%%cln%% As I understand what you were saying%%lst%% it was that %%cmp_if%% a channel supplier such as Fox Sport [sic] had a subscription driver like NRL%%lst%% it would be very unlikely that %%cmp_if%% the channel supplier increased prices %%dsh%%%%dsh%%%%dsh%% SSNIP %%dsh%%%%dsh%%%%dsh%% that there would be substitutability from another channel supplier that had%%lst%% say%%lst%% the AFL?

%%dsh%%%%dsh%%%%dsh%% Yes%%lst%% it does%%sqt%%%%per%% 
(Emphasis added%%per%%

1909 Dr Smith addressed supply side substitutability separately%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In her first report%%lst%% she expressed the view that there was supply side substitutability in the wholesale sports channel market%%lst%% on the ground that%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%Other firms that provide sports channels would be likely to constrain a SSNIP by a particular sports channel supplier%%lst%% even though the composition of the bundle of sports programs offered differs from one channel supplier to another%%lst%% ]^[ ]s[ they would be included in the same market%%lst%% although the extent of the constraint imposed may vary from firm to firm depending on the content offered%%sqt%%%%per%% 
1910 Dr Smith returned to this topic in her third report%%lst%% acknowledging that her reasoning in the first report had ]n[ been entirely clear%%per%%]$~ 
~$[She reiterated her view%%lst%% ]b[ on the basis of several assumptions%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In particular%%lst%% Dr Smith assumed that access to an %%sqt%% essential input %%sqt%%%%lst%% in this case the AFL ]^[ NRL pay television rights%%lst%% would ]n[ be restricted by exclusive supply contracts%%per%%]$~ 
~$[She also assumed that each of the AFL ]^[ the NRL Partnership would offer several bundles of pay television rights ]f[ a period of three to five years%%lst%% with the expiry dates aligned%%per%%]$~ 
~$[On this basis%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%a SSNIP by one general sports channel supplier could occur at the time when new contracts are being negotiated with its retail Pay TV customers (such as Foxtel)%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The SSNIP would be constrained to the extent that the Pay TV retailers can threaten to acquire their sports channels from an alternative sports channel supplier%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Thus%%lst%% %%cmp_if%% the AFL Pay TV rights are split between several sports channel suppliers %%cmp_t%% an attempt by one of these to impose a SSNIP on its retail PAY TV customer/s will be constrained by the risk that that/those customers will switch demand to an alternative sports channel supplier%%sqt%%%%per%% 
1911 Dr Smith justified these assumptions on the ground that to achieve a competitive market it is necessary to exclude %%sqt%% anti%%dsh%%competitive agreements %%sqt%% between the AFL ]^[ the NRL Partnership ]^[ buyers of the rights%%per%%]$~ 
~$[But%%lst%% as she acknowledged%%lst%% the general (although ]n[ invariable) practice has been ]f[ the AFL broadcasting rights ]^[ the NRL pay television rights to be awarded on an exclusive basis%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Moreover%%lst%% they have been awarded ]f[ a lengthy period%%lst%% typically five years ]v[ thereabouts%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Contracts ]f[ the supply of channels with premium content to pay television platforms tend to be negotiated shortly after the rights auctions or%%lst%% alternatively%%lst%% the contracts are terminable %%cmp_if%% the channel supplier loses the premium rights%%per%% 
1912 It seems to me that Dr Smith%%sqt%%s contention that a sports channel with exclusive NRL content can be substituted ]f[ a sports channel with exclusive AFL content rests on an unrealistic set of assumptions%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Hutley put to Dr Smith that %%cmp_if%% there were sports channel markets at all%%lst%% they consisted of distinct product markets %%dsh%%%%dsh%%%%dsh%% that is%%lst%% an AFL sports channel market ]^[ an NRL sports channel market%%per%%]$~ 
~$[When asked to comment on this hypothesis%%lst%% Dr Smith said that there is competition among sports channel suppliers at the point when rights become available %%per%%]$~ 
~$[However%%lst%% during the period in which the AFL ]^[ NRL broadcasting rights are held by different parties%%lst%% Dr Smith accepted that there would ]n[ be much constraint by one channel supplier on the other%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%it may be true that there is no competition between a channel with the AFL rights ]^[ a channel supplier with the NRL rights within the period of the contract%%lst%% [but] I disagree that %%per%%%%per%%%%per%% there is ]n[ a constraint involved at the point of competing ]f[ those rights%%sqt%%%%per%% 
1913 When Dr Smith was asked how one can work out the competitive price ]f[ a channel incorporating NRL content%%lst%% she replied that the constraint applies at the point when parties %%sqt%% compete ]f[ the market %%sqt%%%%per%%]$~

1919 A draft Foxtel board paper prepared in about June 1999 referred to the AFL being a subscription driver in the southern states of Australia%%per%%]$~

~$[The paper assumed that %%cmp_if%% Foxtel carried the AFL it would attract eight per cent more subscribers in the southern states over a 10 year period %%cmp_ta%% it would without the AFL%%per%%]$~

~$[While Seven contends that some of the figures were deliberately exaggerated%%lst%% the fact is that the models proceeded on the basis that AFL programming was the key to achieving greater penetration in the southern States%%lst%% ]b[ that AFL content would have relatively little effect on penetration in the northern States%%per%%

1925 A paper prepared by Mr Keely of Optus in June 2001 referred to market research which showed that more %%cmp_ta%% 85 per cent of Optus%%sqt%% current ]v[ future subscribers considered either AFL ]v[ NRL programming to be at least %%sqt%% reasonably important %%sqt%%%%per%%]$~

1927 In his oral closing submissions%%lst%% Mr Sumption submitted that it does ]n[ follow that%%lst%% %%cmp_b%% some people are committed to one ]v[ other of the football codes%%lst%% there is ]n[ a larger group of people who are prepared to watch either code%%per%%]$~ 
~$[According to Mr Sumption%%lst%% the evidence suggested that C7 ]^[ Fox Sports were substitutable%%lst%% ]n[ ]f[ all consumers%%lst%% ]b[ ]f[ a sufficiently large proportion of consumers%%lst%% to warrant the conclusion that they were in the same market%%per%%]$~ 
~$[This was said to be supported by the fact that Mr Philip ]^[ Mr Macourt both gave evidence that they regarded C7 ]^[ Fox Sports as competitors%%per%% 
1928 In his closing submissions in chief%%lst%% Mr Sumption did ]n[ refer to any evidence in support of this contention%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In his oral reply he returned to the topic ]^[ repeated the contention that%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%there is clearly a substantial overlap between the AFL%%dsh%%watching ]^[ the NRL channel%%dsh%%watching public%%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Again%%lst%% however%%lst%% he cited no evidence in support of the proposition%%per%% 
1929 Mr Sumption attempted to remedy this deficiency by handing up%%lst%% on the very last day of the trial%%lst%% an aide%%dsh%%memoire identifying four documents said to provide evidentiary support ]f[ the submission%%per%%]$~ 
~$[One of the documents is ]n[ in evidence%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In my view%%lst%% none of the others%%lst%% at least without further explanation from witnesses%%lst%% supports the proposition advanced by Mr Sumption%%per%% 
1930 One of the documents%%lst%% ]f[ example%%lst%% is an internal Telstra paper addressing the possible supply of NRL content to Optus%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The paper observed that Optus%%sqt%% loss of NRL programming should make Optus more willing to acquire AFL content from Foxtel %%cmp_b%% %%sqt%% Optus TV must have a major Australian winter sport %%sqt%% (emphasis in original)%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It is difficult to see how this statement demonstrates a substantial overlap between pay television subscribers who are particularly attracted by coverage of the AFL ]v[ the NRL Competition%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Another of the documents relied on by Mr Sumption%%lst%% a %%sqt%% Pay TV Market Tracking Study%%sqt%% prepared ]f[ Foxtel in June 2001%%lst%% suggests that only a small proportion of people %%sqt%%very interested %%sqt%% in watching AFL ]v[ NRL on television are very interested in both%%per%%]$~ 
~$[If anything%%lst%% this document is inconsistent with the contention advanced by Seven%%per%% 
12%%per%%8%%per%%10 General Sports Channel 
1931 Despite urging in one context that AFL ]^[ NRL channels containing exclusive content are ]n[ close substitutes in demand%%lst%% Seven argues in the present context that C7 ]^[ Fox Sports should be regarded as %%sqt%% general sports channels %%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[This is said to follow from the fact that their content was ]n[ limited to AFL ]^[ NRL programming%%lst%% ]b[ included many other sports%%lst%% particularly in the off%%dsh%%season%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Seven further submits that a pay television platform can substitute a general sports channel which carries key subscription driving content with another sports channel with different subscription driving content%%per%% 
1932 There are a number of obstacles in the path of this submission%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It is difficult to understand how it can be reconciled with Seven%%sqt%%s insistence%%lst%% first%%lst%% that C7 could ]n[ survive as a channel supplier without either the AFL ]v[ the NRL pay television rights and%%lst%% secondly%%lst%% that the two sporting codes are substantially complementary%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Moreover%%lst%% some of the evidence on which Seven relies to support the submission relates to possible competition between general sports channels ]f[ the acquisition of rights %%per%%]$~ 
~$[For reasons I have given%%lst%% this evidence has little relevance ]f[ present purposes%%per%% 
1933 It is true that%%lst%% as Seven contends%%lst%% even sports channels with premium content ordinarily require additional sporting content%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Marquard%%lst%% ]f[ example%%lst%% gave evidence that diversity of sporting programs was important to Fox Sports ]f[ a number of reasons%%lst%% particularly in the summer months%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%Major properties such as the NRL ]^[ rugby union are generally only played between mid%%dsh%%February ]^[ September%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Between November ]^[ March%%lst%% the Nine Network broadcasts extensive coverage of cricket played in Australia ]^[ the Seven Network broadcasts golf%%lst%% tennis tournaments held in Australia ]^[ rugby union played overseas by the Australian team%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Fox Sports has in the past employed%%lst%% ]^[ continues to employ%%lst%% strategies in those months to attract ]^[ retain subscribers%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Examples are the acquisition of the broadcast rights to%%cln%%

(vi) the play%%dsh%%off season to Major League Baseball ]^[ the National Football League [in the United States]%%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The problems encountered by the Fox Footy Channel%%lst%% which showed only AFL content ]^[ ultimately closed in September 2006%%lst%% reinforce the importance of including additional sporting content in a channel containing marquee sports%%per%% 
1934 It is%%lst%% however%%lst%% one thing to accept that even a sports channel containing subscription driving content must have additional sporting content%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It is another to conclude that one sports channel with subscription driving content is a close substitute ]f[ another channel with different subscription driving content%%per%%]$~ 
~$[As I have explained%%lst%% the evidence strongly supports the view that Seven relies on %%cmp_e%%where in its submissions%%lst%% namely that channels with exclusive AFL ]^[ NRL content are the two key subscription drivers in Australia%%lst%% ]b[ appeal to largely non%%dsh%%overlapping audiences%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In those circumstances%%lst%% it is difficult to see how C7 ]^[ Fox Sports could have been close competitors notwithstanding that each had general sporting content in addition to their respective premium sports%%per%%]$~ 
~$[As I have explained%%lst%% Seven%%sqt%%s contention is in substance at odds with the opinions expressed by its own experts%%per%% 
1935 Seven%%sqt%%s Reply Submissions contend that even %%cmp_if%% C7 ]^[ Fox Sports should be classified%%lst%% respectively%%lst%% as an AFL ]^[ NRL channel%%lst%% they would still be in the same market%%per%%]$~ 
~$[This is said to follow primarily %%cmp_b%% a merged entity would ]n[ compete in price ]f[ the non%%dsh%%AFL ]v[ non%%dsh%%NRL content ]^[ would be able to extract additional fees from supporters of both codes%%per%%]$~ 
~$[However%%lst%% the submission rests on assertion only ]^[ is ]n[ supported by an empirical analysis of whether the merged entity would raise prices above the competitive level ]f[ each channel%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Such an analysis would require examination of the extent to which non%%dsh%%premium sports shown on the channels were important to viewers (having regard to other sources of such content) ]^[ the extent to which the AFL ]^[ NRL Competitions have a common supporter base%%per%% 
1936 Seven relies on Mr Stokes%%sqt%% evidence that %%cmp_if%% C7 had acquired both the AFL ]^[ NRL pay television rights in 2000%%lst%% Fox Sports nonetheless would ]n[ have been administered a %%sqt%% fatal blow %%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Stokes justified this view on the ground that Fox Sports%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%still had rugby union ]^[ cricket%%lst%% ]s[ they still had 12 months of good sporting product%%per%%]$~ 
~$[We would have been the premier channel ]f[ the winter codes without question%%lst%% ]b[ they would have been still a strong competitor%%sqt%%%%per%% 
1937 This evidence was given by Mr Stokes when he was asked to explain%%lst%% in effect%%lst%% why C7 needed either AFL content ]v[ NRL content to survive%%lst%% ]y[ was prepared to seek both sets of pay television rights to the exclusion of Fox Sports%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In giving his answer%%lst%% Mr Stokes seemed to me to be conscious of the potential difficulties ]f[ C7%%sqt%%s case %%cmp_if%% he acknowledged that Seven%%sqt%%s conduct in seeking to obtain both the AFL ]^[ NRL pay television rights inevitably would have led to the destruction of Fox Sports%%per%%]$~ 
~$[I do ]n[ regard his evidence as providing support ]f[ the proposition that C7 ]^[ Fox Sports were close competitors in 2000 even though each carried different %%sqt%% marquee %%sqt%% sporting content%%per%% 
1938 I do ]n[ think that the other evidence upon which Seven relies on this issue substantially advances its case%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The evidence of the Optus witnesses%%lst%% ]f[ example%%lst%% supports the view that it needed both AFL ]^[ NRL content ]^[ additional sporting content%%per%%]$~ 
~$[But the evidence does ]n[ suggest that one %%sqt%% general sports channel %%sqt%% with live ]^[ exclusive AFL content would be a close substitute ]f[ a second such channel with live ]^[ exclusive NRL content%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Professor Fisher%%sqt%%s evidence is of marginal significance on this issue %%cmp_b%% he rejected the concept of a separate sports channel market%%per%%

12%%per%%8%%per%%11%%per%%1 SUPPLY OF FOX SPORTS TO FOXTEL 
1941 Seven particularly emphasises Telstra%%sqt%%s conduct in benchmarking Fox Sports against C7 ]^[ in putting pressure upon Foxtel to consider taking C7 instead of the Fox Sports channels%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Seven acknowledges that the impact of Telstra%%sqt%%s conduct was %%sqt%% blunted %%sqt%% by reason of the influence of News ]^[ PBL at the board ]^[ management level of Foxtel%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Nonetheless%%lst%% Seven says that Telstra played off C7 against Fox Sports ]^[ that both Mr Macourt ]^[ Mr Philip were concerned about the possible impact of C7 on Fox Sports as a supplier to Foxtel%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Moreover%%lst%% Seven submits that Telstra%%sqt%% records make it clear that C7 was seen by Telstra as direct competition ]f[ Fox Sports ]^[ that Telstra used C7 in negotiations relating to the pricing of the Fox Sports channels%%per%% 
1942 There is no doubt that during 1998 ]^[ 1999 Telstra attempted to play off Fox Sports against C7 with a view to achieving a better price ]f[ the supply of the Fox Sports channels to Foxtel%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Philip recognised as much in his evidence%%per%%]$~ 
~$[During this period%%lst%% there were many examples of Telstra acting on the basis that Foxtel could achieve a better long%%dsh%%term deal with Fox Sports by invoking the threat of competition from C7%%per%%]$~ 
~$[An illustration can be found in a meeting that took place on 17 December 1998 between Mr Blount ]^[ Ms Lowes of Telstra ]^[ Mr Lachlan Murdoch ]^[ Mr Macourt of News%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Ms Lowes%%sqt%% notes record that Mr Blount complained about the proposal that Foxtel pay Fox Sports US$5%%per%%25 pspm on a long%%dsh%%term basis%%lst%% having regard to the Austar pricing of US$3%%per%%70 pspm ]f[ the Fox Sports channels%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Ms Lowes asked at the meeting why Foxtel could ]n[ %%sqt%% leverage a deal between C7 ]^[ Fox Sports %%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The answer given by Mr Macourt was that Foxtel would be hurt %%cmp_if%% it did ]n[ have the Fox Sports channels%%per%% 
1943 Similarly%%lst%% a Telstra board paper of 28 July 1999 recorded that%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%News has consistently indicated they would block Foxtel dealing with C7%%lst%% thereby denying Foxtel the benefit of a competitive negotiation ]^[ a market price%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Meantime%%lst%% they are extracting ]^[ seeking permanently to extract the highest sports prices in the industry from Foxtel%%lst%% knowing that Telstra is funding 50% of this%%lst%% ]^[ News only 25%%%sqt%%%%per%%

~$[He accepted in his evidence that Telstra%%sqt%%s executives had reported to him that research had suggested that C7%%sqt%%s %%sqt%% line%%dsh%%up %%sqt%% was as attractive as that of Fox Sports%%per%%]$~ 
~$[On the basis of this material%%lst%% Dr Switkowski formed the view that it was in Foxtel%%sqt%%s interest to carry C7 ]^[ that it was %%sqt%% possibly %%sqt%% in Foxtel%%sqt%%s interest to carry C7 instead of carrying Fox Sports%%per%% 
1946 The significance of this evidence ]f[ the purposes of market definition must be assessed in context%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The context includes the %%sqt%% interim %%sqt%% arrangements ]f[ the supply of the Fox Sports channels to Foxtel that had been entered into on 13 May 1998%%lst%% by way of a sub%%dsh%%licence from Austar%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In practice%%lst%% these arrangements could ]n[ be altered without the agreement of all Foxtel partners (that is%%lst%% News%%lst%% PBL ]^[ Telstra)%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Thus Telstra%%lst%% in its capacity as a Foxtel partner%%lst%% was locked into the %%sqt%% interim %%sqt%% licence fee of US$5%%per%%25 pspm unless it could persuade both its partners to accept the merits of a different set of arrangements%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Telstra found itself locked into this unhappy position notwithstanding the view of Telstra executives%%lst%% virtually from the outset of the interim arrangements%%lst%% that the price of US$5%%per%%25 pspm ]f[ the Fox Sports channels was much too high ]^[ reflected an attempt by News ]^[ perhaps PBL to divert profits from Foxtel (in which they each effectively held a quarter share) to Fox Sports (in which they held a 100 per cent interest between them)%%per%% 
1947 The legal dimensions of the dispute between Telstra ]^[ News revolved around the Umbrella Agreement%%lst%% which governed News%%sqt%% obligation in relation to the %%sqt%% Alliance %%sqt%% in the form of the Foxtel Partnership%%per%%]$~ 
~$[News was obliged%%lst%% under cl 7 of the Umbrella Agreement%%lst%% to procure ]f[ the Alliance sports programming to which it ]v[ %%sqt%% Related Bodies Corporate %%sqt%% held rights%%cln%%

~$[Internal Telstra documentation makes it clear that Telstra executives understood that a central issue was the reasonableness of the terms on which Fox Sports was being offered ]^[ that Telstra%%sqt%%s interests were served by asserting that C7 was a sports provider comparable to Fox Sports%%per%% 
1949 An example is a Telstra briefing document prepared on 1 September 1999 ]f[ a meeting that was to be held between Telstra ]^[ News to discuss the ongoing dispute%%per%%]$~

~$[The 60 page document pointed out that the objective of the Foxtel joint venture arrangement with News was to maximise the profitability of Foxtel%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It was ]n[ to allow%%cln%%

~$[The document said News was attempting to extract profit from Foxtel ]^[ transfer it to Fox Sports by persisting with a price of US$5%%per%%25 pspm%%per%%]$~

~$[Telstra%%sqt%%s assessment in the document of 1 September 1999 of C7%%sqt%%s attributes did ]n[ take account of the fact that AFL ]^[ NRL appeal to largely different audiences%%lst%% ]b[ appears to have been based on a comparison of content between Fox Sports ]^[ C7 prepared by AT Kearney in August 1999%%per%%]$~ 
~$[However%%lst%% AT Kearney%%sqt%%s comparison%%lst%% which Ms Lowes herself thought was disappointing %%cmp_b%% it did ]n[ answer the real questions%%lst%% hinted at the issue ]b[ did ]n[ explore it%%per%%

~$[PBL argues that it is possible to test the proposition advanced by Seven that%%lst%% in the absence of competition from C7%%lst%% Fox Sports would have been able to charge a monopoly price to Austar%%per%%]$~ 
~$[PBL says that %%cmp_if%% Seven is correct%%lst%% after Foxtel acquired the AFL pay television rights in 2000%%lst%% the Foxtel%%dsh%%Fox Sports monopoly should have been able to increase the amount extracted from Austar ]f[ the supply of the Fox Footy Channel from that previously charged ]f[ the supply of C7%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In fact%%lst%% Austar negotiated terms of $2%%per%%00 pspm on a tier with Foxtel (for DTH ]^[ cable subscribers)%%lst%% precisely the amount it had previously paid ]f[ C7 (with its AFL coverage)%%per%% 
1954 PBL%%sqt%%s submission may ]n[ be a complete answer to Seven%%sqt%%s argument %%cmp_b%% the Fox Footy Channel was an AFL%%dsh%%only service%%lst%% while C7 offered additional sporting content%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In other words%%lst%% while charging the same price%%lst%% Foxtel may have been giving less%%per%%]$~ 
~$[However%%lst%% there are other difficulties in the path of giving too much weight to the Foxtel%%dsh%%Austar experience%%per%% 
1955 The contemporaneous documentation shows that Austar%%lst%% whatever its negotiating stance%%lst%% decided that%%lst%% %%cmp_b%% most of its customer base was north of Wagga Wagga%%lst%% it could ]n[ afford to be without NRL coverage%%per%%]$~ 
~$[This emerges most clearly from Mr Mann%%sqt%%s letters of 27 July ]^[ 25 August 1998 ([640]%%dsh%%[641])%%per%%]$~ 
~$[If anything%%lst%% the correspondence reinforces the conclusion that C7%%lst%% a sports channel carrying exclusive AFL matches as its primary subscription driving content%%lst%% could ]n[ act as a close constraint on Fox Sports%%lst%% carrying exclusive NRL matches as its primary subscription driving content%%per%%]$~ 
~$[This conclusion is further reinforced by the fact that Austar was willing to pay very much more ]f[ Fox Sports %%cmp_ta%% ]f[ C7%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In July 1998%%lst%% it offered to acquire C7%%lst%% %%cmp_if%% carried on basic%%lst%% ]f[ $4%%per%%50 pspm ]f[ the first 200,000 subscribers%%lst%% reducing to $3%%per%%00 pspm ]f[ over 300,000 subscribers%%per%%]$~

~$[Optus had been seeking to acquire the Fox Sports channels ]f[ a considerable period%%per%%

~$[In 2001%%lst%% Optus was aware that it was entitled to terminate the C7%%dsh%%Optus CSA%%lst%% although the timing of that entitlement was a matter of dispute with Seven%%per%%]$~ 
~$[During this period%%lst%% Optus was considering a number of options ]f[ the future%%lst%% including closing its pay television service%%per%%

1962 Seven submits that the evidence supports the proposition that industry participants regarded C7 as a close competitor of Fox Sports in the wholesale sports channel market%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The evidence relied on%%lst%% however%%lst%% is ]f[ the most part to the same effect as that already discussed%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Furthermore%%lst%% to the extent that contemporaneous comments of market participants might suggest that C7 ]^[ Fox Sports were competitors%%lst%% the comments often indicate that the participants were perceived as competitors in relation to the acquisition of sports rights%%lst%% rather %%cmp_ta%% in relation to the supply of sports channels%%per%%

~$[A draft PBL business plan ]f[ 2002 to 2007%%lst%% to which Seven refers%%lst%% is equivocal on the question of C7 ]^[ Fox Sports as competitors in a wholesale sports channel market%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Among other things%%lst%% the draft plan describes free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air sports as a %%sqt%% direct substitute %%sqt%% ]f[ Fox Sports (a view contrary to Seven%%sqt%%s case on the retail television market) ]^[ classifies C7 ]^[ ESPN together merely as the %%sqt%% only other pure sports channel providers %%sqt%%%%per%% 
1964 Seven also points to Mr Philip%%sqt%%s agreement in cross%%dsh%%examination that he regarded C7 as the most significant competitive threat to Fox Sports in the sports channel supply business between 1998 ]^[ 2000%%per%%]$~ 
~$[However%%lst%% Mr Philip%%sqt%%s perception was also that ESPN represented a significant competitive threat%%lst%% suggesting that he was ]n[ necessarily thinking in terms of close competition%%per%%]$~

~$[I do ]n[ think that his evidence overcomes the difficulties facing Seven in establishing that there was at the material times a wholesale sports channel market in which C7 ]^[ Fox Sports were close competitors%%per%%

12%%per%%9 Wholesale Sports Channel Market%%cln%% A Separate Functional Market? 
12%%per%%9%%per%%1 The Respondents%%sqt%% Contention 
1967 In view of the conclusion I have reached%%lst%% it is ]n[ necessary to consider the merits of the Respondents%%sqt%% contention that at the material times there was no separate functional wholesale sports channel market%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The Respondents%%sqt%% contention was succinctly articulated by Professor Hay%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%to the extent [the] Applicants are claiming the existence of a separate relevant market ]f[ the production of wholesale premium sports channels%%lst%% where a premium sports channel is defined as one that includes one of the marquee sports in Australia (at a minimum%%lst%% NRL ]^[ AFL)%%lst%% I do ]n[ believe that the economic analysis that underlies issues of market definition supports the claim%%per%%]$~ 
~$[If a hypothetical single producer of wholesale premium sports channels set out to acquire the NRL and/or AFL rights with the notion of attempting to impose supra%%dsh%%competitive prices on the customers ]f[ those channels (the suppliers of pay TV services)%%lst%% there would be nothing to prevent one ]v[ more of the providers of pay TV services from integrating backwards%%lst%% acquiring the rights directly from the leagues%%lst%% ]^[ either including the matches on existing channels ]v[ creating speciality channels%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Nor would a hypothetical single producer of premium sports channels be able to depress the price paid ]f[ the rights to the marquee sports below competitive levels%%lst%% given the ability of the leagues to integrate forward into the production of sports channels ]v[ to sell the rights directly to the providers of pay TV services%%sqt%%%%per%% 
1968 Professor Hay elaborated on this analysis in the cross%%dsh%%examination%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%[MR SHEAHAN]%%cln%% I gather from your report that you consider any attempt by a single premium sports channel to raise its wholesale price%%lst%% that is to networks%%lst%% above competitive levels would be unsustainable%%scn%% is that right? 
%%dsh%%%%dsh%%%%dsh%% It would be unprofitable%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Would be unprofitable%%qsn%%]$~ 
~$[Unprofitable %%cmp_b%%? 
%%dsh%%%%dsh%%%%dsh%% Because I think the networks have alternatives%%per%%]$~ 
~$[What do you see those alternatives as being? 
%%dsh%%%%dsh%%%%dsh%% Putting together their own channel%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Buying a channel directly from the league%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Buying a channel from someone %%cmp_e%% who is ]n[ currently in the channel business%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Perhaps%%lst%% ]f[ example%%lst%% a free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air broadcaster might decide to go into the channel supply business%%per%%]$~ 
~$[My only point is%%cln%% looking at any one point in time at who is now producing channels%%lst%% premium sports channels%%lst%% simply doesn%%sqt%%t tell you anything about the competitive landscape%%per%%]$~ 
~$[For one thing%%lst%% normally there%%sqt%%s only going to be two of them%%lst%% one of them producing an NRL channel ]^[ one of them producing an AFL channel%%per%%]$~ 
~$[That%%sqt%%s almost %%dsh%%%%dsh%%%%dsh%% I wouldn%%sqt%%t say it%%sqt%%s certain%%lst%% ]b[ that%%sqt%%s simply the fact%%per%%]$~ 
~$[So you look at it ]^[ say%%lst%% %%dqt%%What have I learned about the competitive analysis? 
%%dqt%% Not much%%per%%]$~ 
~$[You need to look over the longer run ]^[ look at the alternatives available to leagues on the one hand ]^[ to platforms on the other hand%%per%%]$~ 
~$[HIS HONOUR%%cln%% When you talk about a channel supplier in this context%%lst%% are you just referring to the services of putting together a program ]v[ are you including a service that involves rights%%lst%% the acquisition of rights having been acquired as an essential input? 
%%dsh%%%%dsh%%%%dsh%% Again%%lst%% at that point%%lst%% once someone has the rights to%%lst%% let%%sqt%%s say%%lst%% the AFL games%%lst%% obviously %%cmp_if%% I want the AFL I have to deal with them%%per%%]$~ 
~$[If you take a longer run perspective ]^[ you say%%lst%% %%dqt%%I think this person may be trying to extract too much,%%dqt%% %%cmp_t%% your longer run strategy is to bid ]f[ the rights yourselves ]v[ to go to the league ]^[ suggest that the league put together a channel%%per%%]$~ 
~$[So there are a variety of options you have%%per%%]$~ 
~$[But%%lst%% when you were talking about a channel supplier%%lst%% you were assuming that the channel supplier was somebody who had the relevant rights was supplying ]n[ only the technical services of putting a program together ]b[ the rights as well? 
%%dsh%%%%dsh%%%%dsh%% A channel supplier is someone who is currently actively engaged in the process of maintaining ]^[ selling a channel with the rights obviously that are needed ]f[ that to occur%%sqt%%%%per%% 
1969 It is inherent in Professor Hay%%sqt%%s reasoning that the mere fact that there are several channel suppliers in business at a given time (a fact relied on by Seven to demonstrate that there is a separate wholesale sports channel market) does ]n[ reveal a great deal about the competitive landscape%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Moreover%%lst%% according to Professor Hay%%lst%% a pay television platform integrating backwards is ]n[ merely a theoretical possibility%%lst%% since it is precisely what Foxtel did when it acquired the AFL pay television rights ]f[ 2002 to 2006 through News%%lst%% rather %%cmp_ta%% through a channel supplier%%per%% 
1970 Professor Fisher%%sqt%%s analysis was to the same effect as that of Professor Hay%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%I find that the pleaded channel markets are too narrowly defined %%cmp_b%% they fail to take into account all the constraints faced by the channel providers as sellers%%per%%]$~ 
~$[A channel provider can be thought of as ]y[ another seller of rights%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It essentially assembles a bundle of pay television programming rights (among other things) to on%%dsh%%sell%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Pay television operators can%%lst%% ]^[ do%%lst%% %%dqt%%go around%%dqt%% channel providers ]^[ purchase rights directly (and/or produce the programming themselves)%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Pay television operators have in the past effectively bypassed channel suppliers (as intermediaries) ]^[ themselves compiled channels after acquiring broadcast rights%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The most obvious example is Foxtel%%sqt%%s production of the Fox Footy channel%%per%%]$~ 
~$[I find that the ability of pay television operators to purchase rights directly serves as an immediate constraint on any wholesale sports channel provider%%per%%]$~ 
~$[If a wholesale sports channel provider%%lst%% such as Fox Sports%%lst%% were attempting to exercise monopoly power in its sale of the collection of rights to pay television operators%%lst%% the rights holders and/or the pay television operators are effectively able to constrain that power by %%dqt%%going around%%dqt%% the channel provider ]^[ dealing with each other directly%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Thereby%%lst%% the channel providers compete with %%dsh%%%%dsh%%%%dsh%% ]^[ are constrained by %%dsh%%%%dsh%%%%dsh%% these other sellers of rights%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Accordingly%%lst%% channel providers do ]n[ themselves constitute a relevant market%%per%%]$~ 
~$[For these reasons%%lst%% there is no relevant wholesale sports channel market nor is there a relevant wholesale channel market%%sqt%%%%per%% 
1971 In cross%%dsh%%examination it was put to Professor Fisher that what he was describing was a sports channel market in which there were potential entrants%%lst%% namely pay television networks integrating up the supply chain ]^[ the sports leagues integrating down the chain%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The discussion continued%%cln%% 
%%sqt%% %%dsh%%%%dsh%%%%dsh%% You can%%lst%% %%cmp_if%% you wish%%lst%% describe it that way%%lst%% ]b[ I think it ends up being quite misleading to talk about a separate market ]^[ %%cmp_t%% take entry separately%%lst%% %%cmp_b%% entry seems to me to be ]s[ easy that one would be better off describing those other players as already in the market%%per%%]$~ 
~$[If you don%%sqt%%t do that%%lst%% it%%sqt%%s okay%%lst%% ]s[ long as you realise there can be no market power in the so%%dsh%%called sports channel market %%cmp_b%% entry is ]s[ easy%%per%%]$~ 
~$[HIS HONOUR%%cln%% But is there any difference in assessing whether market power exists ]v[ the extent of it as to whether (a) there is a separate sports channel market with relative ease of entry in the way that Mr Sheahan has described ]v[ (b) a sports channel market that incorporates as players%%lst%% %%cmp_if%% you like%%lst%% the sports organisations like the AFL ]^[ the NRL ]^[ also incorporates the pay platforms%%qsn%%]$~ 
~$[Is there any practical difference between those two concepts? 
%%dsh%%%%dsh%%%%dsh%% Your Honour%%lst%% I don%%sqt%%t think there is%%lst%% ]^[ I think it is a matter of serious principle that the conclusions at any time to be reached anywhere about market power should ]n[ simply depend on the way you choose to define markets%%per%%]$~ 
~$[You can do it either way ]s[ long as you remember how you are doing it%%per%%]$~ 
~$[But%%lst%% in any event%%lst%% your view from the perspective of assessing market power within the market%%lst%% however defined%%lst%% is that it is ]n[ going to make a great deal of difference how one describes the market? 
%%dsh%%%%dsh%%%%dsh%% Yes%%per%%]$~ 
~$[As between the two alternatives that we have discussed? 
%%dsh%%%%dsh%%%%dsh%% Yes%%lst%% your Honour%%sqt%%%%per%% 
12%%per%%9%%per%%2 The Contention Should Be Accepted 
1972 If it were necessary to do so%%lst%% I would accept the analysis put forward by Professors Hay ]^[ Fisher%%per%%]$~ 
~$[As I have noted%%lst%% the characteristics of the pay television industry at the relevant times included the award of exclusive premium sports rights on a long%%dsh%%term basis%%lst%% ordinarily followed by the negotiation of similarly long%%dsh%%term contracts ]f[ the supply of sporting content (terminable in the event of loss of rights)%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The existence of relatively long term licensing agreements ]f[ the AFL ]^[ NRL pay television rights prevents supply side substitution except when the rights become available%%per%% 
1973 As Dr Smith appeared to accept%%lst%% the constraint on a supplier ]v[ potential supplier of sporting content%%lst%% in these circumstances%%lst%% comes at the point at which the rights become available%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The point emerges in the following extract%%cln%%

~$[Dr Smith%%lst%% on the assumptions that you have been asked to make ]f[ the purposes of analysing whether there is a channel market in which Fox Sports is constrained%%lst%% having regard to your view as to the centrality of the rights auctions%%lst%% it is obvious that a constraint upon Fox Sports on seeking to impose a SSNIP%%lst%% that is monopolising the market%%lst%% would be the capacity of Foxtel%%lst%% %%cmp_if%% confronted by such an attempt%%lst%% to vertically integrate%%cln%% correct? 
%%dsh%%%%dsh%%%%dsh%% If they expected that the rights would be used by Foxtel rather %%cmp_ta%% placed with Fox Sports%%lst%% %%cmp_t%%%%lst%% yes%%lst%% I would agree with that %%sqt%%%%per%% 
(Emphasis added%%per%% 
) 
1974 On the approach taken by Professors Hay ]^[ Fisher%%lst%% the ability of any premium sports channel supplier to extract sustained returns above the competitive level would be constrained by the ability of the pay television platform to %%sqt%% integrate backwards %%sqt%% by securing the rights ]f[ a competitive price at the first opportunity%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The channel supplier would also be constrained %%cmp_b%% others%%lst%% particularly free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air operators%%lst%% could acquire the rights with a view to creating channels with premium sports content (specifically%%lst%% exclusively live ]v[ live ]^[ exclusive AFL ]v[ NRL content)%%per%% 
12%%per%%9%%per%%3 A Real World Foundation? 
1975 Seven%%sqt%%s principal objection to the Respondents%%sqt%% analysis is that the opportunities ]f[ vertical integration do ]n[ signify that two functional levels should be treated as a single market unless the efficiencies of integration are overwhelming%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The efficiencies are said to be negatived by the survival of non%%dsh%%vertically integrated firms%%per%%]$~ 
~$[According to Seven%%lst%% only Foxtel is vertically integrated into sports channel production%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The evidence%%lst%% however%%lst%% suggests that%%lst%% contrary to Seven%%sqt%%s submissions%%lst%% there is a %%sqt%% real world foundation %%sqt%% ]f[ the Respondents%%sqt%% contentions%%per%%]$~ 
~$[While the offer was never accepted%%lst%% cl 6 shows that the potential was present ]f[ the AFL in effect to become a channel supplier ]^[ thus integrate %%sqt%% forwards %%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Telstra%%sqt%%s view was that these events%%lst%% such as the AFL%%lst%% Rugby World Cup ]^[ cricket%%lst%% should ]n[ be included in any deal with Fox Sports%%lst%% ]b[ %%sqt%% should be purchased separately through special purpose joint ventures %%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[As News submits%%lst%% this indicates a potential constraint on Fox Sports%%lst%% in that Telstra was proposing to acquire rights directly%%lst%% although the implementation of the proposal encountered obstacles %%cmp_b%% of the arrangements among the Foxtel partners%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Network AFL contemplated the establishment of a joint venture between the Foxtel Partnership ]^[ the AFL%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Under the strategy%%lst%% the joint venture would acquire the AFL pay television rights ]^[ be the exclusive distributor%%lst%% with the non%%dsh%%exclusive rights to be offered to each of the three major pay platforms%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Foxtel was to bear the early losses ]^[ share the profits with the AFL once they were derived%%per%%]$~ 
~$[During this period%%lst%% both Optus ]^[ Foxtel were involved in a co%%dsh%%operative arrangement ]f[ the production of NRL matches ]f[ broadcast on the pay television platforms%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In the event%%lst%% Optus retained All Media Sports Pty Ltd to produce the NRL matches allocated to it%%lst%% while Foxtel engaged Fox Sports ]f[ the purpose%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In January 2001%%lst%% Optus ]^[ Fox Sports agreed that Fox Sports would supply NRL content to Optus%%per%%]$~ 
~$[However%%lst%% this followed Optus%%sqt%% rejection%%lst%% on financial grounds%%lst%% of an offer by the NRL to grant Optus directly the non%%dsh%%exclusive NRL pay television rights%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The joint venture was to involve the creation of a new NRL%%dsh%%based channel%%lst%% with additional content to be agreed%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Wood remarked in an email to Mr Gammell on 29 October 2000 that%%cln%%

~$[In addition%%lst%% Austar was a 50 per cent shareholder (with Foxtel) in XYZnetworks Pty Ltd (%%sqt%% XYZ %%sqt%%) which supplied a variety of (non%%dsh%%sports) channels to pay television platforms%%per%%

~$[In my view%%lst%% the significance of the discussions between Austar ]^[ Seven%%lst%% ]f[ present purposes%%lst%% is that Austar was considering supporting a bid by C7 ]f[ the NRL pay television rights%%per%%]$~

12%%per%%9%%per%%4 Additional Obstacles? 
1977 Seven relies on a number of obstacles that it says any potential sports channel supplier would encounter%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Most of these are mentioned in the context of Seven%%sqt%%s contention that there are high barriers to entry in the wholesale sports channel market%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Of course%%lst%% this particular contention assumes the existence of such a market%%lst%% the very point in issue here%%per%%]$~ 
~$[However%%lst%% Seven relies on some of these barriers as demonstrating the unlikelihood of a pay television platform ]v[ sporting league (or anyone %%cmp_e%%) integrating backwards ]v[ forwards in response to a channel supplier%%sqt%%s attempt to impose a supra%%dsh%%competitive price ]f[ its premium sports channel%%per%% 
1978 Seven identifies many potential obstacles%%lst%% some of which are of little import%%per%% 
1979 In support of the last point%%lst%% Seven says that it is necessary to take account of%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%Foxtel%%sqt%%s clear signalling to the industry that it will ]n[ accept carriage of any channel which competes with Fox Sports%%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Seven also relies on Dr Smith%%sqt%%s observation that%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%Conduct by an oligopolist may result in a change in market structure%%lst%% ]f[ example by raising barriers to entry%%lst%% ]v[ the conduct itself may deter entry%%lst%% ]f[ example by signalling the likelihood of an aggressive response to entry which would be likely to result in substantial ]^[ ongoing losses ]f[ the entrant%%lst%% ]v[ by restricting access to the customer base in some way (for example via long term contracts)%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Such conduct may significantly raise the expected cost of entry ]^[ ]s[ may confer market power on the firm concerned%%lst%% that is%%lst%% the strategic conduct is the source of the firm%%sqt%%s market power%%sqt%%%%per%% 
1980 To some extent%%lst%% Seven%%sqt%%s arguments are undercut by the examples of actual ]v[ contemplated vertical integration to which I have already referred%%per%%]$~ 
~$[They are further undercut by evidence from Seven%%sqt%%s witnesses ]v[ its own actions%%per%% 
1981 Mr Stokes was asked by Mr Meagher about his perceptions as to the alternatives available to the AFL ]^[ the NRL Partnership when disposing of their sports rights in 2000%%per%% 
1982 The reference to ESPN is of some importance in the present context%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Gammell accepted in his evidence that at all material times he believed that ESPN was in a position to develop substantial Australian sports content on its channel%%per%%]$~ 
~$[He said that he understood in mid%%dsh%%1998 that ESPN was looking to develop its Australian sports content%%per%%

~$[Mr Stokes acknowledged that the First ]^[ Last Deed negotiated in 1997 involved a possible joint venture between Seven ]^[ the AFL%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Stokes also agreed that consideration had been given within Seven in July 2000 to a proposal whereby Optus would acquire the NRL pay television rights ]^[ Seven would produce the content ]f[ Optus ]^[ other pay television operators%%per%% 
1984 Elsewhere in his evidence%%lst%% Mr Stokes agreed that it was %%sqt%% pretty easy %%sqt%% ]f[ an organisation such as Seven to set up a new pay television channel%%per%%]$~ 
~$[He reiterated that point in the context of explaining C7%%sqt%%s bid ]f[ the NRL pay television rights%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Stokes commented that Seven already had the resources to produce most of the NRL games%%lst%% in part %%cmp_b%% Seven%%sqt%%s existing resources had been under%%dsh%%utilised%%per%%]$~ 
~$[He said that he was satisfied that Seven had the skills%%lst%% expertise ]^[ personnel necessary to produce the NRL content%%per%% 
1985 In a similar vein%%lst%% Mr Wood%%lst%% when questioned about the discussions that Seven had held with Optus in July 2000%%lst%% said that he saw no impediment at the time to a free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air station such as Ten taking over the production ]^[ supply of channels to Optus as a pay television operator%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The views expressed by Mr Stokes ]^[ Mr Wood reflect the fact that free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air broadcasters usually have the facilities ]^[ expertise required to produce such channels ]^[ can do ]s[ quite easily%%per%%]$~ 
~$[They also tell against Seven%%sqt%%s contention that the editorial ]^[ compilation functions involved in the creation of a sports channel mean that the supply of the channel cannot be regarded as a close substitute ]f[ the pay television rights themselves%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The evidence suggests that once the rights have been acquired the rest is relatively easy%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The rights are the critical component%%per%%

~$[In this context%%lst%% Mr Stokes accepted that %%cmp_if%% Seven had to create a new channel%%lst%% it would have had no difficulty in acquiring additional sporting content within about three ]v[ four months%%per%%]$~

~$[Indeed%%lst%% on Seven%%sqt%%s case%%lst%% Foxtel%%sqt%%s conduct in refusing to take C7 in 1999 ]^[ 2000 was aimed specifically at Seven ]^[ its pay television channel supplier%%per%%]$~

12%%per%%9%%per%%5%%per%%1 SEVEN%%sqt%%S OFFER IN 2000 
1989 Seven seeks to explain its involvement in the 2000 AFL broadcasting rights process primarily on the basis that it wished to take advantage of the MSGs provided ]f[ in the C7%%dsh%%Optus CSA%%per%%]$~ 
~$[No doubt this was a factor in Seven%%sqt%%s decision%%dsh%%making%%per%%]$~ 
~$[But as PBL submits%%lst%% Mr Stokes%%sqt%% willingness to offer $30 million per annum ]f[ the AFL pay television rights in December 2000 ]v[ January 2001 is explicable only on the basis that he believed%%lst%% notwithstanding the %%sqt%% signals %%sqt%% conveyed by Foxtel%%lst%% that Seven would obtain carriage on Foxtel %%cmp_if%% it (Seven) acquired the AFL pay television rights%%per%% 
1990 Mr Sumption appeared to concede as much in his oral closing submissions%%per%%]$~ 
~$[That concession is ]n[ surprising (even %%cmp_if%% it is refreshing)%%lst%% given the evidence%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Gammell told the AFL on two separate occasions in August 2000 that C7 would get on Foxtel %%cmp_b%% Foxtel could ]n[ afford to keep C7 off its pay television platform%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Wise confirmed the conversations ]^[ agreed that Mr Gammell%%sqt%%s position reflected his own view at the time%%per%% 
1991 I am prepared to accept readily that any potential acquirer of premium sporting rights would need to pay careful attention to the likelihood of any sports channel built around those rights being licensed on commercial terms to Foxtel%%lst%% the principal pay television platform%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In theory%%lst%% it may be possible ]f[ such a potential acquirer to discount entirely the prospect of a sale to Foxtel%%lst%% relying instead on selling the entirety of%%lst%% say%%lst%% the AFL broadcasting rights to a combination of free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air broadcasters%%per%%]$~ 
~$[However%%lst%% in practice%%lst%% a prospective new entrant is less likely to be able to meet a hypothetical single channel supplier%%sqt%%s attempt to impose a SSNIP ]f[ an AFL%%dsh%%based channel by directly acquiring the AFL pay television rights%%lst%% %%cmp_if%% the entrant assesses that it is unlikely to gain access to the principal pay television platform%%per%% 
1992 The experience in 2000 suggests that a potential new sports channel supplier would proceed on the basis that Foxtel would act rationally in its own commercial interests ]^[ would negotiate in a reasonably predictable way with a new supplier of an AFL%%dsh%%content ]v[ NRL%%dsh%%based channel%%per%%]$~ 
~$[If Seven%%lst%% said to be the target of Foxtel%%sqt%%s conduct in 1999 ]^[ 2000%%lst%% was prepared to bid ]f[ the AFL pay television rights on the basis that it would be able to sell its AFL channel to Foxtel%%lst%% it is difficult to see why any other potential premium sports channel supplier would take a different view%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The AFL seems to have reached that conclusion%%lst%% since Seven%%sqt%%s solicitors told the ACCC in December 2000 that the AFL was confident that there would be additional bidders the next time around%%per%% 
1993 It is also material that in December 2000 Seven was prepared to bid $60 million per annum ]f[ the NRL pay television rights%%per%% 
1994 I agree with Mr Meagher%%sqt%%s submission that this evidence is inconsistent with the existence of a strategic barrier of the kind relied on by Seven%%per%%]$~ 
~$[On Mr Stokes%%sqt%% evidence%%lst%% Seven was prepared to bid a full price ]f[ the NRL pay television rights in the expectation that C7%%lst%% with NRL content%%lst%% could be sold to Foxtel%%lst%% notwithstanding Foxtel%%sqt%%s refusal in 1999 ]^[ 2000 to take the C7 channel%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Moreover%%lst%% according to Mr Stokes%%lst%% Seven was prepared to bid ]f[ the NRL pay television rights knowing that it might also succeed in its bid ]f[ the AFL pay television rights%%per%%]$~ 
~$[This evidence is difficult to reconcile with Seven%%sqt%%s contention that any potential sports channel supplier would be deterred from bidding to a competitive level ]f[ premium sports rights by any %%sqt%% signals %%sqt%% given by Foxtel as to its willingness to negotiate on commercial terms%%per%% 
12%%per%%9%%per%%5%%per%%2 SEVEN%%sqt%%S SUCCESS IN 2005 
1995 Seven succeeded in 2005 in acquiring the AFL broadcasting rights ]f[ 2007 to 2011%%per%%]$~ 
~$[This success provides further evidence that Seven did ]n[ see Foxtel%%sqt%%s %%sqt%% signals %%sqt%%%%lst%% nor its apparently dominant place in the retail pay television industry%%lst%% as a barrier to paying what seems to have been a full price ]f[ a package of AFL broadcasting rights%%lst%% including the right to sub%%dsh%%license to pay television operators%%per%% 
1996 It is true%%lst%% as Seven points out%%lst%% that Seven ]^[ Ten acquired the AFL broadcasting rights pursuant to the exercise of the last right under the First ]^[ Last Deed%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It is also true that the form of the final agreement was dictated by the structure of PBL%%sqt%%s offer to the AFL ]^[ that the initial offer by Seven ]^[ Ten sought live ]^[ exclusive rights only to five free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air AFL matches per round (although later offers extended to all AFL matches)%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Nonetheless%%lst%% the simple fact is that Seven ]^[ Ten agreed to accept an offer reflecting the terms of PBL%%sqt%%s offer%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Moreover%%lst%% Seven made its decision on the explicit basis%%lst%% set out in its internal communications%%lst%% that Foxtel would be likely to negotiate on commercial terms ]f[ a sub%%dsh%%licence of the AFL pay television rights (that is%%lst%% the rights to broadcast exclusively on pay television those AFL matches ]n[ required by the free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air operators)%%per%% 
1997 In making this assessment%%lst%% Seven doubtless took into account the fact that Foxtel%%sqt%%s position in 2005 ]^[ 2006%%lst%% in relation to AFL content%%lst%% was somewhat different from its position in 2000%%per%%]$~ 
~$[By late 2005%%lst%% Foxtel had been offering AFL content to subscribers ]f[ four seasons%%lst%% whereas in 2000 it had ]y[ to provide such content%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Foxtel had a particular incentive in 2005 ]^[ 2006 to secure AFL content ]f[ the succeeding seasons%%lst%% in order to avoid %%sqt%% churn %%sqt%% (loss of subscribers) %%cmp_if%% it ceased to provide content highly prized by some subscribers%%per%%]$~ 
~$[On the other hand%%lst%% Seven%%sqt%%s assessment in 2000 took into account Foxtel%%sqt%%s need to obtain the AFL in order to improve its penetration into the southern States%%per%% 
1998 In 2005%%dsh%%2006 Seven also contemplated as a serious commercial possibility that the AFL pay television rights%%lst%% %%cmp_if%% necessary%%lst%% could be sub%%dsh%%licensed to other channel suppliers%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Contrary to Seven%%sqt%%s Reply Submissions%%lst%% it is ]n[ entirely %%sqt%% fanciful %%sqt%% to include ESPN in the category of potential sub%%dsh%%licensees%%lst%% since the evidence suggests that Seven at one time took seriously the possibility of negotiating with ESPN with a view to ESPN taking a sub%%dsh%%licence of the AFL pay television rights%%per%% 
(I should record that Seven made a belated suggestion%%lst%% apparently based on the AFL%%sqt%%s submissions%%lst%% that the terms of the offer accepted by Seven pursuant to the First ]^[ Last Deed permitted it to sub%%dsh%%license the pay rights only to Foxtel ]v[ Austar%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The point was ]n[ developed and%%lst%% in my view%%lst%% lacks substance%%per%% 
) 
1999 There was no evidence as to the outcome of negotiations between Seven ]^[ Ten (on the one hand) ]^[ Foxtel (on the other) concerning the sub%%dsh%%licensing of the AFL pay television rights ]f[ 2007 to 2011%%lst%% following the exercise by Seven ]^[ Ten of the last right%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It is clear that%%lst%% by the time the evidence closed in this case%%lst%% the negotiations had ]n[ borne fruit and%%lst%% indeed%%lst%% the parties were %%cmp_t%% a considerable distance apart%%per%%]$~ 
~$[However%%lst%% I do ]n[ draw the inference that it was unlikely that the negotiations would ultimately result in a sub%%dsh%%licensing agreement on commercial terms between the rights holders ]^[ the major pay television platform%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The hearing concluded some months before the commencement of the 2007 AFL season ]^[ at that stage the negotiations had a long way to go%%per%% 
2000 Seven submits that PBL went to some lengths to construct its offer ]f[ the AFL broadcasting rights in 2005 in a restrictive manner%%per%%]$~ 
~$[According to Seven%%lst%% PBL wished to ensure that the terms of the last offer by the AFL (which had to mirror PBL%%sqt%%s offer) would force Seven ]^[ Ten to recognise that they needed Foxtel%%sqt%%s co%%dsh%%operation to make the acquisition of the AFL broadcasting rights commercially worthwhile%%per%%]$~ 
~$[If anything%%lst%% Seven%%sqt%%s submissions highlight the nature of the calculations underlying Seven%%sqt%%s decision%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Even %%cmp_if%% PBL had the motives Seven attributes to it%%lst%% Seven was quite prepared to commit itself to acquiring the AFL broadcasting rights without any agreement with Foxtel being in place%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Seven no doubt had fall%%dsh%%back positions available%%lst%% such as sub%%dsh%%licensing %%sqt%% surplus %%sqt%% AFL broadcasting rights to other free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air operators%%per%%]$~ 
~$[But sub%%dsh%%licensing to Foxtel was always likely to be the most direct avenue ]f[ Seven (and Ten) to recoup from a third party a significant portion of the outlay ]f[ the AFL broadcasting rights%%per%% 
2001 Seven submits that I should find that Seven had decided in late 2005 ]v[ early 2006 that it would ]n[ set up its own sports channel%%per%%]$~ 
~$[While there is no evidence that Seven gave active consideration to the option of setting up its own sports channel%%lst%% there is also no evidence that Seven had ruled it out%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Given Mr Stokes%%sqt%% evidence as to the ease with which a free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air operator could create a new sports channel incorporating AFL content%%lst%% it seems to me that the creation of such a channel was a realistic commercial option available to Seven%%lst%% even though it may ]n[ have been the preferred option%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Whether as events turned out there would be any particular advantage to Seven in taking this course is ]n[ a matter that I need to address%%per%% 
12%%per%%9%%per%%6 Conclusion 
2002 In view of the conclusion I have reached that C7 ]^[ Fox Sports were ]n[ competitors in a wholesale sports channel market as pleaded by Seven%%lst%% it is ]n[ necessary to consider whether%%lst%% at the material time%%lst%% there was a separate functional wholesale sports channel market%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Nonetheless I have addressed that issue%%per%% 
2003 In my view%%lst%% Seven has ]n[ established that there was such a market%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The fundamental reason ]f[ ]s[ concluding is that an attempt by a sports channel supplier holding the AFL ]v[ NRL pay television rights to impose a SSNIP could be met by a pay television platform ]v[ a third party acquiring the AFL ]v[ NRL pay television rights at a competitive price when they became available%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The evidence establishes that it is relatively easy%%lst%% once the rights have been acquired%%lst%% to join with an existing channel supplier ]v[ free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air operator ]v[ to set up a new channel%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It is ]n[ helpful%%lst%% in the setting in which AFL ]^[ NRL pay television rights are acquired ]^[ exploited through sports channels%%lst%% to assess market power by reference to sports channel suppliers%%per%% 
12%%per%%10 Retail Pay Television Market 
12%%per%%10%%per%%1 Pleadings 
2004 Seven pleads that there is ]^[ has been since at least November 1998 a market in Australia ]f[ retail supply of pay television services to subscribers (%%sqt%% the retail pay television market %%sqt%%) as follows%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%(a) The market is an Australia%%dsh%%wide market ]f[ the retail supply of pay television services%%per%% 
(b) The principal suppliers of pay television services in the market are Foxtel%%lst%% Optus ]^[ Austar%%per%% 
(c) The service is distinct from%%lst%% ]^[ ]n[ substitutable with%%lst%% the free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air television services provided by the free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air television networks%%per%%]$~ 
~$[A free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air television service provides only one channel with programming of general appeal%%lst%% which is free%%lst%% whereas a pay television service provides%%lst%% amongst other things%%cln%% 
(i) a package of multiple television channels%%scn%% 
(ii) channels which conform to a particular genre ]v[ subject%%lst%% such as a news channel%%lst%% a movie channel%%lst%% a documentary channel%%scn%% 
(iii) programming that is ]n[ available%%lst%% ]^[ of a type which is ]n[ available%%lst%% on free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air services%%scn%%

(v) programming of narrow appeal ]v[ niche programming%%scn%% 
(vi) fewer advertisements%%lst%% in particular during movies%%scn%% ]^[ 
(vii) repeats of some programming at different times ]^[ dates%%lst%% 
]f[ which the subscribers pay a fee%%per%% 
(d) The conduct of providers of retail pay television services%%lst%% ]^[ the price at which providers of retail pay television services provide services%%lst%% is ]n[ constrained%%lst%% ]v[ alternatively ]n[ constrained to any significant extent%%lst%% by the activities of free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air broadcasters%%sqt%%%%per%% 
2005 The existence ]v[ otherwise of the retail pay television market as pleaded by Seven is important ]f[ several purposes%%per%% 
12%%per%%10%%per%%2 Seven%%sqt%%s Submissions 
2006 Seven submits that the relevant question is whether a hypothetical pay television retailer monopolist could profitably impose a SSNIP%%per%%]$~ 
~$[If not%%lst%% the products ]v[ services which constrain the hypothetical monopolist are in the same market as those provided by the monopolist%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Seven accepts that a quantitative analysis is ]n[ feasible ]^[ it is %%cmp_tf%% necessary to %%sqt%% undertake a qualitative approach%%lst%% drawing inferences from available evidence%%sqt%%%%per%% 
2007 Seven contends that the retail market ]f[ pay television does ]n[ include free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air television %%cmp_b%% pay television caters to consumer preferences that are ]n[ met by free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air television%%per%% 
2008 Pay television is %%cmp_tf%% highly differentiated from free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air television and%%lst%% ]f[ that matter%%lst%% other entertainment products such as first run movies ]v[ DVDs%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Seven submits that the strong differentiation of pay television content indicates that the demand ]f[ it is highly price inelastic%%per%%]$~ 
~$[A SSNIP would ]n[ cause movement along the demand curve that would render the increase in price unprofitable%%per%% 
2009 From a supply perspective%%lst%% the free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air networks have no capacity to respond competitively to a SSNIP by retail pay television platforms%%lst%% since they do ]n[ charge viewers a fee ]^[ the quality of their service is already maximised by reason of competition between the free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air operators%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Furthermore%%lst%% Foxtel%%sqt%%s pricing policies%%lst%% in particular its ability to charge more ]f[ satellite %%cmp_ta%% ]f[ cable ]^[ more ]f[ digital %%cmp_ta%% analogue%%lst%% show that free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air operators are ]n[ a close constraint on the competitive price ]f[ pay television%%per%% 
2010 Seven emphasises the different business models of pay television ]^[ free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air operators%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The latter seek to attract mass audiences ]^[ to sell audiences to advertisers%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Pay television retailers%%lst%% by contrast%%lst%% attempt to satisfy the breadth of demand ]f[ television viewing%%lst%% arising from %%sqt%% the heterogeneity of consumers%%sqt%% preferences %%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Their business model aims to maximise subscription revenue%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Pay television operators %%cmp_tf%%%%lst%% seek to induce consumers to subscribe rather %%cmp_ta%% to maximise subscribers%%sqt%% viewing of pay television channels%%per%% 
2012 It follows%%lst%% ]s[ Seven submits%%lst%% that pay television is in a different product market %%cmp_ta%% free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air television%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Seven notes that the expert economists generally agreed that the greater the degree of differentiation between products%%lst%% the less strongly substitutable they are (a point Seven was ]n[ quite ]s[ keen to emphasise in relation to the debate about the wholesale sports channel market)%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Seven argues that the effect of product differentiation in the present context was to enable Foxtel to increase its prices while also increasing subscriber numbers%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In short%%lst%% Foxtel%%sqt%%s product differentiation was designed to develop a strong consumer preference ]f[ pay television%%lst%% such that consumers would be willing to pay a substantial price%%lst%% including installation fees ]^[ minimum term commitments%%per%% 
2013 Seven also contends that%%lst%% %%cmp_b%% free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air operators are capacity%%dsh%%constrained%%lst%% they cannot expand output in response to a SSNIP by a pay television platform%%per%%]$~ 
~$[While in theory the free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air operators could improve quality%%lst%% ]f[ example by decreasing the volume of advertisements ]v[ acquiring highly attractive content%%lst%% they are unlikely to do ]s[ in response to a SSNIP%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Among other things%%lst%% by reason of competition among themselves they would already be likely to be implementing an optimal mix of content ]^[ advertising%%per%% 
12%%per%%10%%per%%3 News%%sqt%% Submissions 
2014 News counters Seven%%sqt%%s written submissions with 50 closely typed pages of responses%%per%%]$~ 
~$[News%%sqt%% starting point is that the experts agree that free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air television constrains pay television to some extent%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Thus the critical question ]f[ the purposes of definition of the relevant market is whether the constraint is close%%per%%]$~ 
~$[According to News%%lst%% the %%sqt%% qualitative evidence %%sqt%% shows that Foxtel was in fact closely constrained by free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air television%%per%% 
2015 News accepts that the pay television platforms have a different business model %%cmp_ta%% that of free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air operators%%per%%]$~ 
~$[However%%lst%% it argues that this does ]n[ mean that free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air television does ]n[ constrain pay television platforms%%per%%]$~

~$[The evidence shows that both media consider that they compete ]f[ the same audience%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Indeed%%lst%% according to News%%lst%% Foxtel has conducted its business on the basis of attempting to attract the maximum number of viewers%%per%% 
2016 News relies on Foxtel%%sqt%%s programming practices to demonstrate that Foxtel attempted to %%sqt%% counter%%dsh%%schedule %%sqt%% against the free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air broadcasters%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Crowley%%lst%% the Head of Programming at Foxtel%%lst%% gave evidence that he would examine the free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air schedules with a view to providing different programming ]f[ persons who were unlikely to be interested in the free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air programs ]v[ similar programming ]s[ as to attract the same ]v[ similar kinds of viewers%%per%% 
2017 News also relies on churn data to support its claim that pay television competed with free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air television ]f[ viewers%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The evidence shows that in 2000 Foxtel was experiencing high rates of churn (that is%%lst%% subscribers who disconnect from Foxtel in any given month as a percentage of total subscribers at the end of the period)%%lst%% even though Mr Mockridge had succeeded in reducing the rate from 50 per cent to 25 per cent%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Since most of the churn was away from pay television altogether (rather %%cmp_ta%% to Optus)%%lst%% News submits that the evidence shows that many subscribers did ]n[ consider that pay television represented value ]f[ money%%per%%]$~ 
~$[News invites me to find that%%cln%%

~$[News%%lst%% by contrast%%lst%% contends that firms often seek to differentiate their products from competitors which provide a close constraint on their pricing%%per%%]$~

12%%per%%10%%per%%4 Reasoning 
12%%per%%10%%per%%4%%per%%1 THE ISSUE 
2019 The debate about the existence ]v[ otherwise of a separate retail pay television market throws up an unusual feature of the relationship between free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air television ]^[ pay television services%%per%%]$~ 
~$[As Dr Smith explained%%lst%% free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air television is a %%sqt%% public good %%sqt%%%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%[it] lacks excludability (once it is available anyone can use it whether ]v[ ]n[ they are prepared to pay ]f[ it) ]^[ is non%%dsh%%rivalrous (consumption by one person does ]n[ reduce availability ]f[ others)%%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[As Dr Smith also explained%%lst%% retail pay television platforms charge subscribers ]f[ the right to view the channels they offer%%lst%% restricting access through encryption devices%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Thus pay television is ]n[ a public good%%per%% 
2020 Dr Smith pointed out that there is nothing unique in the notion that a public good can closely constrain the pricing of a product ]f[ which people have to pay%%per%%]$~ 
~$[She gave as an example free newspapers%%lst%% which may constrain (or be said to constrain) the pricing behaviour of subscription newspapers%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The question that has to be answered is whether the public good sufficiently constrains the pricing ]^[ production decisions of the subscription products as to be a close economic substitute %%per%%]$~ 
~$[That question%%lst%% as Dr Smith acknowledged%%lst%% requires an evaluative judgment (a %%sqt%% thought experiment %%sqt%%) as to whether%%lst%% in this case%%lst%% free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air television constrains a pay television platform from profitably raising its prices by about five to ten per cent over a period of time that is appropriate to the market definition issue%%per%% 
2021 Dr Smith accepted that pay television operators were %%sqt%% ultimately constrained %%sqt%% by the free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air operators%%lst%% ]b[ maintained that the constraint was insufficient to place them both in the same market%%per%%]$~ 
~$[By %%sqt%% ultimately constrained %%sqt%%%%lst%% Dr Smith meant that the demand ]f[ retail pay television services was influenced by the offering of the free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air networks ]^[ that there was some competition ]f[ programming%%per%% 
12%%per%%10%%per%%4%%per%%2 COMPETING FOR THE SAME VIEWERS 
2022 One of the reasons News gives ]f[ contending that free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air television%%lst%% at the relevant times%%lst%% constrained the pricing of pay television was that both competed ]f[ the same pool of viewers%%per%%]$~ 
~$[News relies on evidence that suggests%%lst%% perhaps ]n[ surprisingly%%lst%% that pay television%%lst%% like free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air television%%lst%% seeks to maximise its viewing audience%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Mockridge%%sqt%%s objective at Foxtel%%lst%% ]f[ example%%lst%% was%%cln%%

~$[Mr Mockridge also said that Foxtel scheduled Fox 8 %%sqt%% with a view to very direct competitive activity with free TV %%sqt%%%%per%%

~$[He considered it to be in the interests of XYZ ]^[ its shareholders to maximise the viewing of Foxtel ]^[ Austar as a whole ]^[ that his underlying goal was to%%cln%%

~$[He said nothing in his reports about the retail pay television market%%lst%% ]b[ he was asked in cross%%dsh%%examination about reports he had prepared in 1995 ]^[ 1997 in relation to a proposed merger of Foxtel ]^[ Austar%%per%%]$~ 
~$[As Professor Hay correctly said in evidence%%lst%% he did ]n[ express the view on either occasion that free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air television ]^[ pay television were necessarily in separate markets%%per%%]$~ 
~$[He did opine%%lst%% however%%lst%% that the %%sqt%% prudent position %%sqt%% ]f[ the ACCC to adopt was a %%sqt%% conservative one %%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Professor Hay%%sqt%%s view at the time was that the ACCC should act on the basis that there was a separate retail pay television market%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%at least until the real competitive forces have evolved in such a way as to prove conclusively the existence of a single broad market%%sqt%%%%per%% 
2027 Professor Hay recognised in his 1995 report (a position in effect reiterated by him in 1997) that the competitive forces that had operated in the United States ]^[ other countries possibly would%%cln%%

%%sqt%%Viewers who watch many hours of sports on pay TV will almost certainly reduce the number of hours spent watching free TV with consequent implications ]f[ the total amount of advertising revenues that will be generated by a given program%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Thus%%lst%% it is hardly surprising that free TV networks lobbied ]f[ the anti%%dsh%%siphoning legislation%%per%% 
(A second motive ]f[ supporting the legislation would be the concern that competition from pay TV would bid up the cost of sporting events%%per%% 
) However%%lst%% even though more meals eaten at home mean less eating in restaurants%%lst%% this does ]n[ mean that supermarkets ]^[ restaurants are in the same market %%per%%]$~ 
~$[By the same token%%lst%% the availability of some sporting events on free TV says little about the ability of a monopoly pay TV provider to extract supra%%dsh%%normal prices ]f[ the broad cluster of programs being provided (including the considerable number of major sporting events that apparently will be available on pay TV despite the legislation)%%per%% 
%%sqt%% (Emphasis added%%per%% 
) 
2029 Professor Hay%%sqt%%s reasoning in 1995%%lst%% in my opinion%%lst%% is equally applicable to the period from 1998 to 2002%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The fact that pay television seeks to attract viewers from the general body of free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air television viewers (virtually everyone) does ]n[ necessarily mean that free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air operators are in the same retail market as pay television platforms%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In particular%%lst%% it does ]n[ mean that free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air television operators constrain pay television platforms from profitably imposing price increases of from five to 10 per cent over a period of time%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Nor is the position changed by the fact that pay television operators may choose to schedule certain programs with an eye to free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air programming%%per%%]$~ 
~$[That is a manifestation of the fact that pay television operators must both attract ]^[ retain subscribers from the general body of television viewers%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The operators must also offer programming that is sufficiently attractive to justify subscribers paying the required fees%%lst%% notwithstanding the availability of a free television viewing alternative%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It is how the product is made attractive that is particularly important%%per%% 
2030 Mr Williams of Foxtel gave evidence consistent with this analysis%%per%%]$~ 
~$[He said that he regarded a greater %%cmp_ta%% 50 per cent share of television viewing by Foxtel%%sqt%%s subscribers (that is%%lst%% where existing subscribers watch pay television more %%cmp_ta%% 50 per cent of the time they devote to television viewing) as a measure of subscribers%%sqt%% satisfaction with Foxtel%%sqt%%s programming%%per%%]$~ 
~$[But the need ]f[ Foxtel to ensure that its subscribers were sufficiently satisfied with Foxtel%%sqt%%s programming to maintain their subscriptions%%lst%% having regard to a free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air %%sqt%% alternative %%sqt%%%%lst%% does ]n[ mean that free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air television operators constitute a constraint%%lst%% in the relevant economic sense%%lst%% on the pricing of Foxtel%%per%% 
2031 Furthermore%%lst%% it is ]n[ correct to say that pay ]^[ free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air television simply compete ]f[ viewers%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The objective from the perspective of pay television platforms is to provide subscribers ]^[ potential subscribers with offerings they are prepared to pay for%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Hence the emphasis%%lst%% ]n[ ]s[ much on mass audiences%%lst%% ]b[ on offering channels ]^[ programs that appeal to strong minority preferences that are ]n[ catered for%%lst%% ]v[ are catered ]f[ insufficiently%%lst%% on free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air television%%per%% 
2032 As Professor Fisher agreed%%lst%% it is ]n[ correct to say that the aim of pay television is to attract as many viewers as possible%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Rather it is to attract as many paying subscribers as possible%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Hence the comment in a Fox Sports marketing plan ]f[ 2000/2001%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%We must %%cmp_tf%% wherever possible provide consumers with what they want to watch%%lst%% how ]^[ when they want to watch it%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The question must always be asked what are consumers prepared to pay for%%qsn%%]$~ 
~$[Not just what are they prepared to watch%%per%%]$~ 
~$[This is the fundamental point of difference between pay television ]^[ free to air television%%sqt%%%%per%% 
2033 The differences between free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air television ]^[ pay television models are well illustrated by the extent to which operators in each sector depend on advertising revenue%%per%%]$~ 
~$[As has been seen in Chapter 4%%lst%% the BS Act requires that subscription fees%%lst%% ]n[ advertising revenue%%lst%% be the predominant source of revenue ]f[ subscription television licensees%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In fact%%lst%% pay television operators derive only a very small proportion of their revenue from advertising%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In the four financial years from 1 July 1998 to 30 June 2002%%lst%% advertising revenue constituted between 1%%per%%7 per cent ]^[ 4%%per%%1 per cent of C7%%sqt%%s total revenue from operations%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Williams estimated that in the 2001/2002 year%%lst%% Foxtel derived between five ]^[ 10 per cent of its revenue from advertising%%lst%% ]b[ %%sqt%% probably closer to 5 per cent %%sqt%%%%per%% 
12%%per%%10%%per%%4%%per%%3 PRODUCT DIFFERENTIATION 
2034 Seven ]^[ the Respondents appear to be in furious agreement that pay television operators go to considerable lengths to differentiate their product from free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air offerings%%per%%]$~ 
~$[News refers%%lst%% ]f[ example%%lst%% to Mr Mockridge%%sqt%%s evidence that pay television pursued exclusivity wherever it could%%lst%% just as free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air television did%%per%%]$~ 
~$[By way of example%%lst%% pay television broadcasts first%%dsh%%run movies that cannot be broadcast on free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air television %%cmp_b%% pay television has an %%sqt%% earlier window ]f[ release of a movie %%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Williams said that Foxtel needs original content to differentiate its service from the Commercial ]^[ National Broadcasters%%per%%]$~ 
~$[He gave as illustrations content commissioned by Foxtel in areas ]n[ well provided ]f[ in free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air television%%lst%% such as music%%lst%% comedy%%lst%% documentary ]^[ children%%sqt%%s programming%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Williams pointed out that%%lst%% in order to defray costs%%lst%% Foxtel sometimes worked with the free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air broadcasters%%lst%% particularly in commissioning Australian drama%%lst%% although in more recent times there had been less emphasis on joint ventures%%per%% 
2035 While this evidence is ]n[ in dispute%%lst%% the parties disagree as to the significance of pay television%%sqt%%s differentiation of its product from free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air television%%per%%]$~ 
~$[News contends that a firm acts rationally in differentiating its product from another product only %%cmp_if%% it is closely constrained by the firm producing the second product%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It follows%%lst%% ]s[ News argues%%lst%% that the evidence of product differentiation actually indicates that free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air television ]^[ pay television are in the same market%%per%% 
2036 News submits that Dr Smith%%sqt%%s evidence supports its argument%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It is true that Dr Smith agreed with the theoretical proposition that it is ]n[ rational ]f[ a firm to continue to modify its product ]s[ as to further differentiate it from another product unless the second product is in the same market%%per%%]$~ 
~$[However%%lst%% Dr Smith qualified her answer%%per%%]$~ 
~$[She pointed out that a firm may engage in product differentiation in order to create a demand where none has previously existed%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In that situation%%lst%% the pay television platform (if it is the product differentiator) is developing its product in order to increase its subscriber base ]^[ profitability%%per%%]$~ 
~$[As Dr Smith explained%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%Differentiation from free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air%%lst%% %%cmp_if%% you are already outside the market%%lst%% may ]n[ be something that you are concerned with%%per%%]$~ 
~$[You want to maintain that differentiation%%lst%% you want to make your product more appealing%%lst%% ]b[ you also want to grow your market%%per%%]$~ 
~$[So what you are looking to do is to develop your product%%lst%% perhaps that%%sqt%%s a better terminology%%lst%% in different ways to attract consumers ]n[ just from free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air ]b[ who have done all sorts of other things perhaps in the past ]v[ who know what they have been doing%%per%%]$~ 
~$[So it is in fact development of the product which may mean doing things differently%%lst%% ]s[ loosely described as differentiation%%sqt%%%%per%% 
2037 Moreover%%lst%% as Professor Fisher accepted%%lst%% a firm might rationally seek to differentiate its product from those that constrain it to some extent%%lst%% ]b[ ]n[ closely %%per%%]$~ 
~$[He agreed%%lst%% ]f[ example%%lst%% that a manufacturer of cellophane might stress the differences between its product ]^[ grease%%dsh%%proof baking paper%%lst%% even though the products are ]n[ in the same market%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The reason%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%might have been either to ensure that people kept on believing that there was something special about cellophane%%lst%% ]v[ indeed ]s[ special about cellophane that they were willing to pay even higher prices ]f[ it before they turned to others%%sqt%%%%per%% 
12%%per%%10%%per%%4%%per%%4 THE CRITICAL POINT%%cln%% CHOICE 
2038 It seems to me that News%%sqt%% submissions attempt to compartmentalise issues in a way that does ]n[ correspond to the facts%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The attraction of pay television %%dsh%%%%dsh%%%%dsh%% an attraction that requires consumers to pay ]f[ the service %%dsh%%%%dsh%%%%dsh%% does ]n[ rest merely on %%sqt%% product differentiation %%sqt%%%%lst%% although that is part of it%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The critical point is that pay television offers subscribers something that free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air television (and other forms of entertainment) cannot%%cln%% a very wide choice among a range of programs in the subscriber%%sqt%%s own home%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The choice includes access to subscription driving content that is exclusive to pay television%%per%% 
2039 The point was recognised by Mr Mockridge ]^[ Mr Williams in their evidence%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Perhaps curiously%%lst%% the cross%%dsh%%examination focussed on Foxtel%%sqt%%s efforts to differentiate its content from free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air television%%lst%% rather %%cmp_ta%% on more general strategies ]f[ expanding its subscriber base%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Nonetheless%%lst%% both Mr Mockridge ]^[ Mr Williams gave broader answers %%cmp_ta%% particular questions required%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Each answer identified choice of programming as the fundamental differentiator between pay television ]^[ free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air television%%per%% 
2040 Mr Mockridge%%lst%% when invited to agree that Foxtel%%sqt%%s business model was to differentiate its product from free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air by various techniques%%lst%% answered as follows%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%Fundamentally%%lst%% multichannel television%%lst%% the differentiator is that there%%sqt%%s more of it%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It%%sqt%%s television%%lst%% it%%sqt%%s often the same thing%%lst%% ]b[ there%%sqt%%s a much greater choice%%per%%]$~ 
~$[That%%sqt%%s the differentiator%%sqt%% %%per%% 
(Emphasis added%%per%% 
) 
Similarly%%lst%% Mr Williams%%lst%% when asked about sports as a subscription driver%%lst%% replied that%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%my personal view is that the proposition of choice in subscription television is the primary driver %%lst%% ]^[ that is informed from sport%%lst%% from movies ]^[ from other genres%%lst%% particularly documentary ]^[ areas that we can own%%lst%% such as music ]^[ children%%sqt%%s programming%%sqt%%%%per%% 
(Emphasis added%%per%% 
) 
2041 In my opinion%%lst%% it is the capacity of pay television to satisfy intense%%lst%% ]b[ diverse consumer preferences%%lst%% together with its ability to offer exclusive programming in the key subscription%%dsh%%driving area of premium sports ]^[ movies%%lst%% that sets it apart from free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air pay television ]^[ other forms of home entertainment%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The subscriber is prepared to pay ]f[ the choice ]^[ opportunity to access exclusive content within that field of choice%%per%%]$~ 
~$[He ]v[ she has the added benefit that pay television%%lst%% which derives only a small proportion of its revenue from advertising%%lst%% has fewer advertisements %%cmp_ta%% free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air television%%per%% 
2042 A similar point was made in a submission made to the ACCC on Foxtel%%sqt%%s behalf in about June 1999%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Although the submission argued that consumers see pay television ]^[ free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air television as competitive services%%lst%% it summarised the reasons ]f[ subscribers being willing to pay fees as follows%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%[Consumers] are swayed in their decision to subscribe to Pay TV by a number of factors including a greater number ]^[ variety of channels%%lst%% newer release movies%%lst%% more sport%%lst%% niche viewing%%lst%% fewer advertisements ]^[ better children%%sqt%%s programs%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The decision to subscribe to Pay TV is thus based on a perception of the quality ]^[ quantity of Pay TV which justifies the cost of paying ]f[ a service which can be received ]f[ free%%sqt%%%%per%% 
2043 As all parties agree%%lst%% in the absence of quantitative information relating to the constraints imposed by free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air television on a SSNIP imposed by pay television platforms%%lst%% an evaluative judgment is required%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It seems to me that Dr Smith is well justified in arguing that the willingness of subscribers to pay substantial fees ]f[ pay television when free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air networks are available without charge suggests that the demand ]f[ pay television is relatively price inelastic%%per%%]$~ 
~$[However%%lst%% I do ]n[ think it is simply a matter of inferring from the willingness of subscribers to pay $40 to $50 pspm that a small ]b[ significant price increase will ]n[ lead to a loss of subscribers in favour of free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air television%%per%% 
2044 The evidence in this case has focussed on the subscription%%dsh%%driving potential of premium sports%%lst%% particularly AFL ]^[ NRL content%%lst%% rather %%cmp_ta%% other subscription%%dsh%%driving programming%%lst%% such as movies%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The evidence suggests that subscribers ]v[ potential subscribers have very strong preferences ]f[ the exclusive AFL ]v[ NRL content that is available on pay television%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It is these preferences that fuel the high prices paid ]f[ the AFL ]^[ NRL pay television rights%%lst%% %%cmp%%d with the prices paid ]f[ other sporting content%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The willingness of subscribers to pay substantial monthly fees in order to satisfy their preferences from the wide range of choices available on pay television (including subscription%%dsh%%driving content exclusive to pay television) suggests that small ]b[ significant increases in fees would ]n[ cause them to %%sqt%% switch %%sqt%% to free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air television%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Under the current regime%%lst%% free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air television cannot offer the same range of choices%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Nor can it satisfy the preferences of consumers in the way pay television does%%per%% 
12%%per%%10%%per%%4%%per%%5 CHURN 
2045 News relies on rates of churn to support its contention that pay ]^[ free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air television are in the same market%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It argues that the high rates of churn experienced by Foxtel justify an inference that%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%there are a significantly large number of marginal customers%%lst%% that is%%lst%% pay television customers who would switch %%cmp_if%% either the price of FOXTEL increased ]v[ the quality of its programming decreased relative to free to air television%%per%%]$~ 
~$[High churn suggests that consumers are sensitive about the price to be paid ]f[ the product%%lst%% ]^[ it is reasonable to suppose that churn would increase %%cmp_if%% the price of the product increased%%sqt%%%%per%% 
2046 It is ]n[ entirely obvious why high rates of churn%%lst%% of themselves%%lst%% suggest that subscribers would terminate their subscriptions %%cmp_if%% the pay television operators sought to impose a SSNIP%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The point might be more persuasive %%cmp_if%% News linked increases in churn rates directly to increases in Foxtel%%sqt%%s prices ]v[ to improvements in the quality of free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air television%%per%%]$~ 
~$[But News does ]n[ attempt to make either link%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Mockridge%%lst%% ]f[ example%%lst%% accepted in evidence that Australian free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air television offered the same general quality of programming over the period he was CEO of Foxtel%%per%% 
2047 Similarly%%lst%% %%cmp_if%% it was clear that the prices charged by Foxtel during the relevant period were at competitive levels%%lst%% the point made by News might carry more weight%%per%%]$~ 
~$[But News does ]n[ suggest that it can demonstrate the proposition to be true%%per%%]$~ 
~$[High rates of churn are consistent with subscribers forming the view that discretionary expenditure on entertainment is better directed to forms of entertainment other %%cmp_ta%% pay television%%lst%% ]v[ perhaps is better redirected to other household priorities altogether%%per%% 
2048 In any event%%lst%% I think that Dr Smith was correct when she suggested that the high rates of churn experienced by the industry were in part the result of pay television being a relatively new product in 1999 ]^[ 2000%%per%%]$~ 
~$[News criticises Dr Smith%%sqt%%s suggestion on the ground that it was mere speculation ]^[ was ]n[ grounded in economic concepts%%per%%]$~ 
~$[However%%lst%% Mr Mockridge gave evidence that the annual churn rate had decreased from 50 per cent to 25 per cent while he was CEO of Foxtel ]^[ that he had expected that decline to take place%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%the longer someone had the additional channels%%lst%% the more likely they would keep them%%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Mockridge%%sqt%%s expectations seem to have been borne out beyond his period as CEO of Foxtel%%lst%% as Foxtel%%sqt%%s annual churn rate reduced to an average of about 12 per cent in 2004%%per%% 
2049 This evidence seems to me to be consistent with pay television being a relatively new phenomenon throughout the period 1998 to 2002 (but particularly in the first half of that period)%%per%%]$~ 
~$[During its transitional phase%%lst%% the behaviour of both the pay television platforms ]^[ subscribers had ]n[ ]y[ fallen into a predictable pattern%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Professor Hay%%lst%% in his 1995 report to Optus%%lst%% seems to have anticipated that there would be a transitional period%%per%%]$~ 
~$[He proposed that the ACCC should adopt the prudent course of assuming the existence of a separate retail pay television market%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%until the real competitive forces have evolved in such a way as to prove conclusively the existence of a single broad market%%sqt%%%%per%% 
(Emphasis added%%per%%

2050 Furthermore%%lst%% I agree with Seven%%sqt%%s submission that the evidence%%lst%% such as it is%%lst%% does ]n[ suggest that pay television subscribers relinquished their subscriptions during the relevant period %%cmp_b%% of the availability of free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air television%%lst%% except in the sense that virtually everyone has access to the free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air networks%%per%%]$~ 
~$[A report prepared by consultants ]f[ Foxtel in October 2003%%lst%% which analysed the reasons ]f[ churn%%lst%% recorded that%%cln%%

~$[News challenges the relevance of this statement%%lst%% ]b[ does ]s[ by reference to other statements in the report which were in fact concerned with different issues%%per%% 
2051 The report to Foxtel%%lst%% along with much other evidence%%lst%% shows that an important reason ]f[ subscribers giving up Foxtel was their perception that it did ]n[ represent %%sqt%% value ]f[ money %%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[But this reason does ]n[ demonstrate that free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air television acted as a close constraint on pay television in the relevant sense%%per%%]$~

~$[Mr Mockridge agreed that very few subscribers gave free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air television as the reason ]f[ concluding that pay television did ]n[ give value ]f[ money%%per%%]$~

2052 Seven relies on Foxtel%%sqt%%s pricing practices in relation to its satellite ]^[ cable services to support its contention that Foxtel was ]n[ closely constrained by free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air television%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Seven points out that ever since Foxtel%%sqt%%s satellite service was launched on 1 March 1999%%lst%% the price charged pspm ]f[ its basic satellite service has always been substantially higher %%cmp_ta%% the price of its basic analogue cable service%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In the third quarter of 1999%%lst%% ]f[ example%%lst%% the price of Foxtel%%sqt%%s basic satellite service was $46%%per%%95 pspm (exclusive of GST)%%lst%% while the price of the analogue cable service was $34%%per%%95 pspm%%per%%]$~ 
~$[By the last quarter of 2002%%lst%% when the Foxtel%%dsh%%Optus CSA came into force%%lst%% the differential had been reduced from $12%%per%%00 pspm to $10%%per%%00 pspm%%per%% 
($47%%per%%95 pspm ]f[ satellite%%lst%% %%cmp%%d with $37%%per%%95 pspm ]f[ cable)%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Nonetheless the differential (20%%per%%9 per cent of the satellite pspm price) was still substantial%%per%% 
2053 Seven argues that the substantial differential is indicative of price discrimination practised by Foxtel ]^[ %%cmp_tf%% of the exercise of market power by it%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Moreover%%lst%% ]s[ Seven contends%%lst%% the differential suggests that free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air television was ]n[ a close constraint on the price charged by Foxtel ]f[ its satellite service%%per%%]$~ 
~$[This is said to follow from the fact that only a minority of Foxtel%%sqt%%s satellite subscribers from 1998 to 2002 could choose Optus as an alternative platform%%lst%% while the great majority of Foxtel%%sqt%%s cable subscribers could choose Optus %%cmp_if%% they wished (%%cmp_b%% the Telstra ]^[ Optus Cables largely serviced the same geographic areas)%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Seven submits that %%cmp_if%% free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air television had been a close constraint on Foxtel%%lst%% it would ]n[ have been able to charge its satellite subscribers substantially more %%cmp_ta%% its cable subscribers%%per%% 
2054 I do ]n[ understand News to dispute the logic of Seven%%sqt%%s argument%%per%%]$~ 
~$[News essentially seeks to explain the price differential as resting on differences in the cost structure of satellite ]^[ cable services%%per%% 
2055 It is ]n[ easy on the material available to me to ascertain whether the matters raised by News fully explain the substantial differential in the pricing ]f[ Foxtel%%sqt%%s cable ]^[ satellite subscribers%%per%%]$~ 
~$[My impression is that they do not%%per%%]$~ 
~$[For example%%lst%% the fact that Foxtel adopted uniform national pricing ]f[ cable subscribers seems to me readily explicable by the attention a differential pricing policy based on regions would have invited from regulators%%lst%% %%cmp_if%% ]n[ consumers%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The narrowing of the differential over time does ]n[ alter the fact that the gap remained substantial%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The payment to Telstra cannot fully explain the extent of the differential%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Ascertaining the true costs of installation of cable ]^[ satellite subscriptions seems to me a complex exercise which the evidence does ]n[ allow me to undertake with any confidence%%per%% 
2056 In my view%%lst%% the differential pricing policy adopted by Foxtel tends to support%%lst%% although perhaps ]n[ very strongly%%lst%% Seven%%sqt%%s contention that free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air television did ]n[ closely constrain Foxtel%%sqt%%s pricing during the period 1998 to 2002%%per%%]$~

~$[He also opined that Foxtel%%sqt%%s projected cash flows in its 2002 business plan did ]n[ anticipate that Foxtel would earn monopoly profits over the succeeding decade%%per%% 
2064 Professor Williams%%sqt%% analysis did ]n[ take account of the issues raised by Professor Noll%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The analysis also suffers from the difficulty that%%lst%% as he acknowledged%%lst%% caution must be exercised in using accounting data to draw inferences about a firm%%sqt%%s ability to derive monopoly profits%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In this respect%%lst%% Professor Williams implicitly accepted the validity of the work done by Professor Fisher%%lst%% News%%sqt%% competition expert%%per%% 
2065 Professor Fisher is the co%%dsh%%author of an influential paper entitled %%sqt%% On the Misuse of Accounting Rates of Return to Infer Monopoly Profits %%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[As Professor Fisher explained in evidence%%lst%% the basic point made in that article is that the critical concept in determining whether a firm is making monopoly profits is the firm%%sqt%%s %%sqt%% economic rate of return %%sqt%%%%lst%% ]n[ its %%sqt%% accounting rate of return %%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The two concepts are different ]^[ are ]n[ necessarily related%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The economic rate of return is very difficult to assess %%cmp_b%%%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%in principle %%per%%%%per%%%%per%% %%cmp_if%% you want to look at the economic rate of return%%lst%% one should look at the cash flows that the firm receives ]^[ one would have to look at them over a long period of time In principle%%lst%% you have to look at them over the entire life of the firm %%lst%% which typically hasn%%sqt%%t happened yet%%sqt%%%%per%% 
(Emphasis added%%per%% 
) 
Indeed%%lst%% Professor Fisher said that the economic rate of return may be impossible to compute in particular cases %%cmp_b%% of the need to project the long%%dsh%%term future of the firm%%per%% 
2066 Professor Fisher applied his approach to the current case in the following exchange%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%[MR SHEAHAN:] Your opinion%%lst%% I take it%%lst%% Professor%%lst%% was that you could not%%lst%% by taking a particular profit ]^[ loss statement of a company ]v[ even a set of them%%lst%% deconstruct it ordinarily in order to come up with an economic rate of return? 
%%dsh%%%%dsh%%%%dsh%% Well%%lst%% that%%sqt%%s true%%lst%% ]b[ that is ]n[ to say that one cannot under some circumstances actually reach some inferences%%per%%]$~ 
~$[For example%%lst%% in the present case there is%%lst%% as you know%%lst%% a series of accounting statements which show negative cash flows ]f[ Foxtel over a long period of time%%lst%% ]^[ that%%sqt%%s before depreciation%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Now%%lst%% it may perfectly well be true %%dsh%%%%dsh%%%%dsh%% one cannot know %%dsh%%%%dsh%%%%dsh%% that off there in the future is a great balloon of profit which is going to be made %%per%%]$~ 
~$[But there is no evidence%%lst%% ]s[ to speak%%lst%% that that is likely to happen%%lst%% ]^[ it certainly hasn%%sqt%%t happened ]f[ a very long time%%lst%% ]^[ one has to have%%lst%% you know%%lst%% a serious amount of faith to suppose that this is going to be consistent with earning monopoly returns%%per%%]$~ 
~$[You can%%sqt%%t prove it won%%sqt%%t happen%%sqt%%%%per%% 
(Emphasis added%%per%% 
) 
2067 Professor Williams attempted to project Foxtel%%sqt%%s likely future returns on the basis of its 2002 business plan ]^[ to relate these to the present value of Foxtel%%sqt%%s investment at the end of the 2003/2004 year%%per%%]$~ 
~$[This exercise involved a good deal of uncertainty ]^[ was sensitive%%lst%% among other things%%lst%% to the discount rate chosen%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The value of Professor Williams%%sqt%% analysis ]f[ present purposes is also affected by the fact that he did ]n[ (and indeed could not) take into account more recent accounting information produced by Foxtel%%per%%]$~ 
~$[That information%%lst%% in my view%%lst%% does ]n[ rule out the realistic chance of%%lst%% in Professor Fisher%%sqt%%s phrase%%lst%% a %%sqt%% great balloon of profit %%sqt%% in the future%%per%% 
2068 The result is that I do ]n[ regard Foxtel%%sqt%%s history%%lst%% until recently%%lst%% of negative cash flows as inconsistent with it operating within the retail pay television market identified by Seven%%lst%% nor with Foxtel having a substantial degree of power within that market%%per%% 
12%%per%%10%%per%%4%%per%%8 FOXTEL%%sqt%%S PERCEPTIONS 
2069 Seven accepts that Foxtel%%sqt%%s contemporaneous documents contain many references%%lst%% in one form ]v[ another%%lst%% to free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air television being a competitor of Foxtel%%per%%]$~ 
~$[This concession has prompted the parties to swap sides on the significance of such references ]f[ the purposes of market definition%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Seven%%lst%% having enthusiastically cited contemporaneous comments implying that Fox Sports ]^[ C7 may have competed in a single wholesale sports channel market%%lst%% now seeks to discount contemporaneous comments implying that Seven ]^[ Foxtel may have competed in a single retail television market%%per%%]$~ 
~$[News%%lst%% having discounted contemporaneous documentation implying that Fox Sports ]^[ C7 may have been competitors in a single wholesale sports channel market%%lst%% now enthusiastically cites contemporaneous material implying that Seven ]^[ Foxtel may have competed in a single retail television market%%per%% 
2070 I repeat the note of caution I have sounded about reliance on contemporaneous records ]f[ the purposes of market definition%%per%%]$~ 
~$[They may be very important%%lst%% ]b[ the context of the records must be taken into account%%per%%]$~ 
~$[As Dr Smith accepted%%lst%% free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air television was a constraint on pay television platforms such as Foxtel ]^[ was seen as such by officers of Foxtel ]^[ News%%per%%]$~ 
~$[But the question is whether the free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air operators acted as a sufficiently close constraint on pay television platforms to justify regarding them as in the same market%%per%% 
2071 News accepts the proposition that business people tend to talk of %%sqt%% markets %%sqt%% in a different sense from that used by economists%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Mockridge made the same point in his evidence when a draft Foxtel document was drawn to his attention which asserted that %%sqt%% Foxtel has a commanding lead in a growing market %%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[He observed%%lst%% without prompting%%lst%% that 
%%sqt%%often the word %%dqt%%market%%dqt%% is used in a non%%dsh%%precise term [sic] by people working in businesses%%sqt%%%%per%% 
2072 This perfectly understandable tendency among business people may produce ambiguities in documentation relied on ]f[ the purposes of market definition%%per%%]$~ 
~$[A Foxtel planning document prepared in November 2002%%lst%% ]f[ example%%lst%% referred to a possible competitive threat from free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air operators %%cmp_if%% they are permitted to %%sqt%% multichannel %%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The document noted a correlation between increases in the number of free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air broadcasters ]^[ lower rates of take%%dsh%%up of pay television%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The same document%%lst%% however%%lst%% argued that Foxtel competes in the %%sqt%% entertainment market %%sqt%%%%lst%% which was said to include DVDs%%lst%% cinema%%lst%% free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air television%%lst%% the internet ]^[ even magazines ]^[ books%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Williams%%lst%% the author of the planning document%%lst%% described in his evidence Foxtel%%sqt%%s corporate mission as %%sqt%% standing out from ]^[ complementing other entertainment sources %%sqt%%%%per%% 
2073 A similar ambiguity is evident in a Foxtel memorandum sent to Telstra (with a copy sent to Mr Mockridge) on 23 November 1999%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The memorandum recorded that although Foxtel had %%sqt%% clear leadership %%sqt%% in pay television%%lst%% it was ]n[ complacent about Optus%%lst%% particularly the possibility that it might use pay television as a %%sqt%% loss leader %%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Having identified this threat%%lst%% the memorandum stated that Foxtel%%sqt%%s main competitor was free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air television%%lst%% which was due to launch a digital service in 2001%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The memorandum continued as follows%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%In addition%%lst%% FOXTEL competes in the broad entertainment market which includes [free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air]%%lst%% internet%%lst%% game consoles%%lst%% video rental ]^[ DVD/tape purchases%%lst%% all of which are constantly innovating ]^[ competing ]f[ consumers%%sqt%% time%%sqt%%%%per%% 
2074 Contemporaneous documents may also have been prepared with a particular audience in mind%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Mockridge%%lst%% ]f[ example%%lst%% accepted that he acted as an advocate ]f[ Foxtel in its dealings with the ACCC ]^[ that this meant pressing the argument that free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air ]^[ pay television were in the same market%%per%%]$~ 
~$[He also accepted that his understanding of Foxtel%%sqt%%s interests in this regard influenced the content of documents created within Foxtel%%per%%]$~ 
~$[I do ]n[ doubt that Mr Mockridge honestly held the views he expressed%%lst%% ]b[ those views reflected the interests of Foxtel%%per%% 
2075 Other factors should be borne in mind%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In my view%%lst%% there is some force in Seven%%sqt%%s submission that the identification of free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air operators as competitors of Foxtel may reflect%%lst%% in part%%lst%% the %%sqt%% cellophane fallacy %%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[To the extent that Foxtel was charging above the competitive price%%lst%% churn may have been more readily seen as a loss of subscribers to the free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air %%sqt%% competition %%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[This%%lst%% however%%lst%% would ]n[ necessarily mean that free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air television was a close constraint on Foxtel%%sqt%%s ability to change a supra%%dsh%%competitive price ]f[ its pay television service%%per%% 
2076 Another factor influencing the perception of Mr Mockridge ]^[ others at Foxtel is likely to have been the link between Seven%%lst%% as a free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air operator%%lst%% ]^[ C7%%lst%% as a supplier of sports channels%%per%%]$~ 
~$[I have found that News ]^[ Foxtel were genuinely concerned about Seven%%sqt%%s role as a gate%%dsh%%keeper of the AFL pay television rights by virtue of its control of the AFL broadcasting rights%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Seven was seen as primarily interested in the free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air business ]^[ as having a secondary interest in pay television%%per%%]$~ 
~$[That link%%lst%% in my view%%lst%% influenced perceptions within Foxtel ]^[ News%%per%% 
12%%per%%11 Conclusion 
2077 In my view%%lst%% Seven has established that at the relevant times there was a retail pay television market in which Foxtel%%lst%% Optus ]^[ Austar operated%%per%%]$~

~$[Further%%lst%% since at least November 1998%%lst%% in order to reach a sufficiently critical mass to be economically viable%%lst%% it is important that a retail pay television operator in Australia has access to a sports channel that incorporates a %%sqt%% must have %%sqt%% sport%%lst%% known as a %%sqt%% marquee sport %%sqt%%%%per%%]$~

2120 Until early 2002%%lst%% Optus was reliant on C7 ]f[ a major subscription driver%%lst%% being the C7 channels incorporating AFL programming (par 162)%%per%%]$~

2121 The acquisition of the AFL pay television rights by Foxtel ]^[ C7%%sqt%%s failure to acquire the NRL pay television rights had the consequence that Foxtel filled the last remaining gap in its line%%dsh%%up of marquee sports ]^[ could increase its subscriber numbers at Optus%%sqt%% expense (par 164(a)%%lst%% (c))%%per%%]$~

2122 By reason of the matters pleaded in par 164%%lst%% the effect ]v[ likely effect of the acquisition of AFL pay television rights by Foxtel was a substantial lessening of competition in the retail pay television market (par 165)%%per%%]$~

2141 Seven submits that there is no real dispute that at least one of the parties to the Master Agreement supplied ]v[ acquired goods ]v[ services in each of the four primary markets upon which it relies%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It says %%cmp_tf%% that no issue arises as to whether the terms of s 45(3) of the TP Act are satisfied%%per%%

13%%per%%4%%per%%2%%per%%1 MASTER AGREEMENT 
2142 In accordance with the pleadings%%lst%% Seven says that the Master Agreement was entered into on 13 December 2000 between News%%lst%% Foxtel%%lst%% PBL ]^[ Telstra%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The Master Agreement was intended%%lst%% according to Seven%%lst%% %%sqt%% to secure both the AFL broadcast rights ]^[ the NRL pay%%lst%% internet ]^[ naming rights %%sqt%%%%per%% 
2143 In its Closing Submissions%%lst%% Seven devotes a chapter (Chapter 6) to an anticipated submission by the Respondents to the effect that the acquisition of the AFL broadcasting rights by News involved a series of bilateral arrangements between News ]^[ the sub%%dsh%%licensees%%lst%% rather %%cmp_ta%% multi%%dsh%%party arrangements among the members of a consortium%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Seven apparently assumed that the Respondents would rely on Mr Philip%%sqt%%s rather optimistic evidence that he sought to keep the negotiations between News ]^[ each of the proposed sub%%dsh%%licensees quite separate from each other ]^[ that%%lst%% accordingly%%lst%% there was no meeting of minds necessary to constitute an arrangement ]v[ understanding ]f[ the purposes of s 45(2) of the TP Act %%per%% 
2144 As Seven%%sqt%%s Reply Submissions observe%%lst%% however%%lst%% the Respondents have chosen ]n[ to take issue with Chapter 6 of Seven%%sqt%%s Closing Submissions%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The only significant point of difference between the parties%%lst%% ]s[ far as the existence of the Master Agreement is concerned%%lst%% is whether there was an agreement ]v[ understanding dealing with both the AFL broadcasting ]^[ NRL pay television rights%%per%% 
2145 The Respondents%%sqt%% position%%lst%% exemplified by PBL%%sqt%%s Closing Submissions%%lst%% is that there was no overarching agreement between News%%lst%% PBL%%lst%% Telstra ]^[ Foxtel relating to both the AFL ]^[ NRL pay television rights%%per%%]$~ 
~$[PBL submits that a number of essential elements of each of the AFL ]^[ NRL Proposals were ]n[ dealt with at all at the 13 December 2000 teleconference%%per%%]$~ 
~$[For example%%lst%% there was no mention of the Nine Put%%lst%% which was executed on 14 December 2000%%lst%% ]v[ the Ten Put%%lst%% which was also executed on that day%%per%%

~$[The decision by Fox Sports to proceed with the bid ]f[ the NRL pay television rights was made separately from any decision at the 13 December 2000 teleconference ]^[ was made without Telstra%%sqt%%s participation%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Further%%lst%% there was no connection between the NRL ]^[ AFL bidding processes%%lst%% other %%cmp_ta%% that they were co%%dsh%%incident in time ]^[ involved some of the same individuals%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Neither bid was contingent on the other%%per%% 
2147 Seven%%lst%% however%%lst%% submits that in order to appreciate the scope of the arrangement made on 13 December 2000%%lst%% it is necessary to examine the events leading up to that day%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Philip ]^[ Mr Frykberg had formulated a proposal containing many of the elements of the understanding reached on 13 December 2000%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The proposal that News should acquire the AFL broadcasting rights ]^[ sub%%dsh%%license the AFL pay television rights to Foxtel had the support of News%%lst%% PBL ]^[ Foxtel%%per%%]$~ 
~$[But it had encountered resistance from Telstra ]^[ %%cmp_tf%% from Telstra%%sqt%%s representatives on the Foxtel Management board%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In particular%%lst%% on 8 December 2000%%lst%% Telstra had rejected a proposal that Telstra support a bid ]f[ the AFL pay television rights at $30 million per annum (plus adjustments)%%per%% 
2148 According to Seven%%lst%% Mr Philip ]n[ only sought Telstra%%sqt%%s support ]f[ Foxtel%%sqt%%s involvement in News%%sqt%% bid ]f[ the AFL broadcasting rights ]b[ he also sought Telstra%%sqt%%s support ]f[ Fox Sports%%sqt%% bid ]f[ the NRL pay television rights%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Seven contends that there was a clear link between the acquisition of the AFL ]^[ the NRL pay television rights%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The link%%lst%% ]s[ Seven argues%%lst%% reflects the circumstances surrounding the 13 December 2000 teleconference%%lst%% which had been convened to discuss both the bids ]f[ both the AFL broadcasting rights ]^[ the NRL pay television rights%%per%% 
2149 Seven%%sqt%%s Reply Submissions say this%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%Once it is accepted that there were understandings dealing with each of NRL ]^[ AFL rights%%lst%% it does ]n[ require much to conclude that there was an understanding dealing with both in the circumstances of the present case where the relevant rights were up ]f[ simultaneous renewal%%per%%]$~ 
~$[There are obvious reasons why the understanding between the parties would extend to both sets of rights%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It was seen as highly undesirable that Foxtel secure AFL rights%%lst%% ]b[ %%cmp_t%% C7 obtain NRL rights%%per%%]$~ 
~$[One of the stated objects of the AFL rights acquisition was to obtain the last remaining gap %%per%%]$~

2150 PBL challenges the existence of the Rights Sub%%dsh%%Licence Agreement as pleaded by Seven%%per%%]$~ 
~$[PBL submits that the only point in pleading an agreement whereby News%%lst%% on acquiring the AFL broadcasting rights%%lst%% would sub%%dsh%%license them to Foxtel%%lst%% Nine ]^[ Ten%%lst%% is to connect Nine with the alleged contraventions of the TP Act%%per%%]$~ 
~$[This is being done%%lst%% ]s[ it is argued%%lst%% in circumstances where Seven cannot establish any separate claim in relation to Nine%%sqt%%s acquisition of the AFL free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air television rights%%per%% 
2151 PBL submits that the fact that Nine%%lst%% Ten ]^[ Foxtel knew of each other%%sqt%%s participation in a bid organised by News does ]n[ establish an agreement ]v[ understanding betwween them%%per%%]$~ 
~$[There was no meeting of minds%%per%%]$~ 
~$[On the contrary%%lst%% each of the parties was concerned to maximise the benefit to itself%%lst%% ]f[ example in relation to the %%sqt%% flip%%dsh%%flop %%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Moreover%%lst%% Nine ]^[ Ten each made its own decision independently on 14 December 2000%%per%%

~$[A series of bilateral communications is sufficient%%lst%% provided that the parties share a common purpose%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In this case%%lst%% the parties shared a common purpose%%lst%% namely supporting News%%sqt%% bid ]f[ the broadcasting rights to be parcelled out between them in a pre%%dsh%%determined manner%%per%%]$~

~$[What they were doing made no sense except as a common undertaking%%per%% 
13%%per%%4%%per%%3 Effect of The Master Agreement Provision 
2153 According to Seven%%lst%% by the time the Master Agreement was formed%%lst%% all the essential terms of the Foxtel Put%%lst%% the Nine Put%%lst%% the Ten Put ]^[ News%%sqt%% bid ]f[ the AFL broadcasting rights had been finalised%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Seven argues that%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%The terms of the Put Agreements supported a bid by News of $76 million per annum (plus CPI ]f[ the years 2003 to 2006) ]f[ AFL broadcast rights%%lst%% with additional benefits in the form of newspaper support in newspapers owned by the News Group%%lst%% magazine support in magazines owned by a subsidiary of PBL%%lst%% ]^[ obligations of News in respect of overseas broadcasts by companies in the News Group%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The News bid was the winning bid%%per%% 
(Seven had a right to match the free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air bid%%lst%% ]b[ this did ]n[ affect the disposition of the AFL pay rights)%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It follows that the direct effect of the Master Agreement%%lst%% in relation to the AFL pay rights%%lst%% was that Foxtel acquired those rights ]^[ C7 did not%%sqt%%%%per%% 
2154 Seven submits that it is unnecessary to consider whether the likely effect of the Master Agreement Provision at the time of its formation was that Foxtel would acquire the AFL pay television rights%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The actual effect of the Master Agreement was that those rights were acquired%%per%%]$~ 
~$[That suffices%%lst%% ]s[ Seven contends%%lst%% to establish a contravention of s 45(2)(a)(ii) of the TP Act%%per%% 
2155 Nonetheless%%lst%% Seven also submits that the likely effect of the Master Agreement Provision%%lst%% at the time the parties entered into the Master Agreement%%lst%% was that the AFL pay television rights would be acquired by Foxtel%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The Master Agreement Provision contemplated ]^[ required that%%lst%% %%cmp_if%% News%%sqt%% bid was successful%%lst%% the AFL pay television rights would be sub%%dsh%%licensed to Foxtel%%per%%]$~ 
~$[This is said to be sufficient ]f[ the Master Agreement Provision to have had the proscribed effect%%per%%]$~ 
~$[But the Master Agreement Provision had%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%the additional effect of requiring the implementation of a %%cmp_t%% contemplated bid%%lst%% being the winning bid%%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Seven says that it is incorrect to regard this as a case involving an agreement subject to a contingency (that is%%lst%% that News had first to acquire the AFL pay television rights)%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The agreement%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%facilitated the acquisition of [the AFL pay] rights%%lst%% ]^[ indeed provided ]f[ the making of the successful bid%%sqt%%%%per%% 
2156 According to Seven%%lst%% this is sufficient to conclude that the Master Agreement Provision had the requisite likely effect of substantially lessening competition in the pleaded markets at the time the parties entered into the Master Agreement%%per%%]$~ 
~$[However%%lst%% the Master Agreement Provision also facilitated in other respects the News bid ]f[ the AFL broadcasting rights%%per%% 
2157 So far as the NRL pay television rights are concerned%%lst%% Seven submits that %%cmp_if%% Mr Philip%%sqt%%s evidence is accepted it was a foregone conclusion at the time the parties entered into the Master Agreement on 13 December 2000 that C7 would ]n[ acquire the NRL pay television rights%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It follows%%lst%% ]s[ Seven argues%%lst%% that the likely ]^[ actual effect of the Master Agreement Provision was that Foxtel would acquire the AFL pay television rights%%lst%% in circumstances where C7 was bound to be unsuccessful in its attempt to secure the NRL pay television rights%%per%% 
2158 If Mr Philip%%sqt%%s evidence was false ]^[ News was ]n[ prepared to bid more %%cmp_ta%% $25 million per annum ]f[ the NRL pay television rights%%lst%% the Master Agreement Provision ensured Telstra%%sqt%%s support ]f[ a higher bid%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In these circumstances%%lst%% the Master Agreement Provision had the likely ]^[ actual effect of enabling Fox Sports to acquire the NRL pay television rights over C7%%per%% 
2159 Seven%%sqt%%s Reply Submissions seek to develop the cryptic observation made in Seven%%sqt%%s Closing Submissions that the actual effect of the Master Agreement Provision was that Foxtel acquired the AFL pay television rights%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Seven points to authorities that support the proposition that the %%sqt%% effect %%sqt%% of a contract involves a backwards%%dsh%%looking assessment%%per%%]$~ 
~$[While some cases concern proposed contracts ]v[ contracts which %%sqt%% have ceased in their incipience %%sqt%%%%lst%% others concern contractual provisions which have actually been performed%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In the latter category of cases%%lst%% of which the present is an example%%lst%% an assessment of the effect of the contract is informed by the facts ]^[ is %%cmp_tf%% %%sqt%% present ]v[ retrospective %%sqt%%%%per%% 
2160 Seven%%sqt%%s Reply Submissions point out that s 45(2)(a)(ii) of the TP Act prohibits the making of a contract ]v[ arrangement%%lst%% ]v[ arriving at an understanding%%lst%% %%cmp_if%% a provision of the proposed contract%%lst%% arrangement ]v[ understanding would have ]v[ be likely to have the effect of substantially lessening competition in a market%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Seven says that s 45(2)(a)(ii) incorporates a temporal element%%cln%% that is%%lst%% the use of the word %%sqt%% would %%sqt%% reflects the fact that the prohibition is on making a contract ]v[ arrangement ]v[ arriving at an understanding%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Section 45(2)(a)(ii) %%cmp_tf%% necessarily requires the Court to assess the prospective effect of a provision in the contract%%lst%% arrangement ]v[ understanding%%per%%]$~ 
~$[However%%lst%% Seven contends that where a contract is performed (as in the present case)%%lst%% it is permissible to examine the actual effect of the contract ]^[ draw any reasonable inference when assessing the likely effect of the relevant provisions%%per%% 
2161 Seven also relies on s 45(2)(b)(ii) of the TP Act which%%lst%% ]s[ it argues%%lst%% the Respondents have ignored in their submissions%%per%% 
(If the Respondents did ignore s 45(2)(b)(ii)%%lst%% in my view%%lst%% it was %%cmp_b%% Seven%%sqt%%s Closing Submissions did ]n[ make the argument apparent%%per%% 
) Seven submits that conduct in %%sqt%% giving effect %%sqt%% to a provision may be continuing conduct%%lst%% requiring the assessment of the effect of the provision to be undertaken a considerable time after the agreement was formed ]v[ first came into operation%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Accordingly%%lst%% the Court should assess the effect ]^[ likely effect of giving effect to a provision on each occasion that such a %%sqt%% giving effect %%sqt%% occurs%%per%% 
2162 For example%%lst%% on Seven%%sqt%%s case%%lst%% the Consortium Respondents gave effect to the Master Agreement Provision%%lst%% which came into operation on 13 December 2000%%lst%% by entering into the News%%dsh%%AFL Licence on 19 December 2000 ]^[ the News%%dsh%%Foxtel Licence on about 21 January 2001%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In determining whether giving effect to the Master Agreement Provision in this way had ]v[ was likely to have the effect of substantially lessening competition%%lst%% it is necessary to take account of events that had occurred at the times the licences came into force (that is%%lst%% at the times the parties gave effect to the Master Agreement Provision)%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Moreover%%lst%% Seven submits that it is also permissible to take into account the fact that Foxtel ultimately acquired the AFL pay television rights ]^[ that Fox Sports ultimately acquired the NRL pay television rights in determining the effect of the Master Agreement Provision%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Seven advances further submissions in relation to s 45(2)(b)(ii)%%lst%% to which I refer below%%per%% 
2163 Seven submits that News%%sqt%% submissions are flawed insofar as they suggest that%%lst%% ]f[ the purposes of s 45(4) of the TP Act %%lst%% regard may only be had to agreements in force on the date the relevant contract%%lst%% arrangement ]v[ understanding was entered into%%per%%]$~ 
~$[News%%sqt%% submissions are said to be based on a mistaken view as to the time when a substantial lessening of competition must be assessed%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Further%%lst%% once the %%sqt%% temporally extended nature of assessment under s 45(2)(b)(ii) is grasped %%sqt%%%%lst%% News%%sqt%% submissions are %%sqt%% manifestly wrong %%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[According to Seven%%lst%% %%sqt%% [e]ffects are accretive %%sqt%%%%per%%

~$[In particular%%lst%% Seven rejects News%%sqt%% argument that Seven%%sqt%%s conduct in ]n[ making its best bid ]f[ the AFL pay television rights on 14 December 2000 prevented the Master Agreement Provision having that likely effect%%per%%]$~

~$[In any event%%lst%% ]s[ it contends%%lst%% Seven%%sqt%%s conduct did ]n[ amount to a %%sqt%% supervening event %%sqt%% that broke what otherwise would be the chain of causation between the Master Agreement Provision ]^[ its effect%%per%% 
13%%per%%4%%per%%4 %%sqt%%Competition on the Merits%%sqt%% 
2165 Seven%%lst%% in its Closing Submissions%%lst%% appears to concede that %%cmp_if%% the actions of the Consortium Respondents relating to the acquisition of the AFL ]^[ NRL pay television rights %%sqt%% had simply been the ordinary workings of vigorous competition [Seven] would have no case at all%%sqt%% %%per%%]$~ 
~$[This concession seems to have prompted the Respondents to argue that the bidding ]f[ the pay television rights simply constituted%%lst%% in Professor Fisher%%sqt%%s phrase%%lst%% %%sqt%% competition on the merits %%sqt%% ]^[ was %%cmp_tf%% outside the scope of s 45(2) of the TP Act%%per%% 
2166 Seven%%sqt%%s Reply Submissions argue that Australian competition law does ]n[ recognise a concept of %%sqt%% competition on the merits %%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Seven contends that s 45(2) of the TP Act does ]n[ require the use of anti%%dsh%%competitive means ]f[ a provision to have the effect ]v[ likely effect of substantially lessening competition%%per%%]$~ 
~$[A %%sqt%% subjectively innocent arrangement%%sqt%% that is ]n[ the result of anti%%dsh%%competitive conduct%%lst%% such as predation%%lst%% tying%%lst%% refusing to deal ]v[ price discrimination%%lst%% nonetheless contravenes s 45(2) %%cmp_if%% it results in a substantial lessening of competition%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It is %%cmp_tf%% ]n[ to the point%%lst%% ]s[ Seven contends%%lst%% that the transactions by which Foxtel ]^[ Fox Sports acquired the AFL ]^[ NRL pay television rights might have involved competitive bids%%per%% 
2167 Mr Sumption developed this point in his final oral submissions%%lst%% in the process elevating the significance of s 45(2)(b)(ii) of the TP Act to Seven%%sqt%%s case %%per%% 
2168 In drawing this temporal distinction%%lst%% Mr Sumption relied on the language used in s 45(2)(b)(ii)%%lst%% in particular the use of the present tense (%%sqt%% has the effect%%sqt%% ) in contrast to the prospective operation of the expression %%sqt%% is likely to have %%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[According to Mr Sumption%%lst%% the fact that the sub%%dsh%%paragraph uses the present tense shows that the language is directed to the Court hearing the case%%per%%]$~ 
~$[He also relied on the fact that Parliament%%sqt%%s concern with minimising the anti%%dsh%%competitive effect of conduct reflects the public interest ]^[ ]n[ merely the private interests of particular parties%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Accordingly%%lst%% ]s[ he argued%%lst%% the sub%%dsh%%paragraph should be construed with the statutory purpose in mind%%per%% 
2169 Mr Sumption identified an issue of principle which arises from the Respondents%%sqt%% insistence that the bidding ]f[ the AFL ]^[ NRL pay television rights amounted to %%sqt%% competition on the merits %%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[He submitted that%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%the acquisition of an essential input ]v[ of the whole of a category of essential inputs ]s[ that no%%dsh%%one %%cmp_e%% can compete with the monopolist in the relevant market necessarily brings about a substantial lessening of competition in that market%%lst%% unless new entry into the market is straightforward%%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Sumption accepted that a mere alteration in the number ]v[ identity of firms in a given market is ]n[ enough to constitute a contravention of s 45(2) of the TP Act%%per%%]$~ 
~$[But %%cmp_if%% the provision of a contract%%lst%% arrangement%%lst%% ]v[ understanding has the consequence of substantially lessening competition in the relevant market%%lst%% s 45(2) is contravened notwithstanding that the parties making ]v[ giving effect to the contract%%lst%% arrangement ]v[ understanding have ]n[ employed anti%%dsh%%competitive means to do so%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Thus s 45(2) applies%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%to a case where the effect of a transaction is to confer substantial market power on one firm in a market ]v[ to increase the substantial market power that that firm already has%%sqt%%%%per%% 
2170 The Respondents%%sqt%% submissions concerning competition on the merits%%lst%% according to Seven%%lst%% elide two distinct propositions%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The first%%lst%% which is common ground%%lst%% is that the purpose of competition law is to protect competition%%lst%% ]n[ competitors%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The second is that where a firm engages in legitimate competitive conduct%%lst%% any consequences flowing from that conduct cannot amount to a substantial lessening of competition%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Seven says that the second proposition is misconceived as a matter of law%%per%% 
2171 In the present case%%lst%% ]s[ Mr Sumption submitted%%lst%% C7%%sqt%%s demise as a firm constraining Fox Sports in the wholesale sports channel market was attributable to its failure to acquire an essential input ]f[ its business (either the AFL ]v[ NRL pay television rights)%%per%%]$~ 
~$[That failure came about by reason of the conduct of News%%lst%% PBL%%lst%% Foxtel ]^[ Fox Sports in making an arrangement which effectively monopolised the essential inputs%%per%%]$~ 
~$[So a contravention of s 45(2) of the TP Act is made out%%per%% 
13%%per%%4%%per%%5 Logic of Seven%%sqt%%s Case 
2172 In his oral closing submissions%%lst%% Mr Sumption accepted that Seven%%sqt%%s case would be exactly the same %%cmp_if%% the understanding ]v[ arrangement at the teleconference of 13 December 2000 had been confined to the acquisition of the AFL broadcasting rights ]^[ News ]^[ Fox Sports had relied entirely upon News%%sqt%% last right to ensure that Fox Sports obtained the NRL pay television rights%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Sumption also accepted that the logic of Seven%%sqt%%s position%%lst%% once Fox Sports had a real chance of acquiring the NRL pay television rights%%lst%% was that News ]v[ Foxtel simply could ]n[ lawfully bid ]f[ the AFL pay television rights%%per%%]$~ 
~$[He formulated the issue of principle this way%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%in circumstances where the result of acquiring both rights%%lst%% possibly %%per%%%%per%%%%per%% entirely fairly%%lst%% is to eliminate a competitor in a market which has high barriers to entry%%lst%% is that result nevertheless acceptable in section 45 terms %%cmp_if%% the process by which the rights have been acquired is itself perfectly fair? 
%%sqt%% 
2173 Mr Sumption%%sqt%%s answer was to formulate this principle%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%If the facts are that the disposal of an essential input to a single party will produce a substantial lessening of competition in a relevant market%%lst%% %%cmp_t%% the AFL would be in a position where it could ]n[ let those rights as a single block%%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[He argued that the principle%%lst%% %%cmp_if%% accepted%%lst%% would ]n[ put the AFL%%lst%% as a seller of rights%%lst%% in an invidious position%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It could sell the %%sqt%% unique input %%sqt%% (the AFL pay television rights) in segments or%%lst%% alternatively%%lst%% apply to the ACCC ]f[ authorisation under s 88 of the TP Act %%per%% 
13%%per%%4%%per%%6 Anti%%dsh%%Competitive Means 
2174 If%%lst%% contrary to Seven%%sqt%%s argument%%lst%% it is necessary ]f[ it to establish that the parties to the Master Agreement Provision employed %%sqt%% anti%%dsh%%competitive means %%sqt%%%%lst%% Seven says that such means were in fact employed in connection with the bid ]f[ the AFL pay television rights%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Foxtel had assessed the bid to be loss making over the term of the agreement and%%lst%% in any event%%lst%% the cost of the rights was likely to be more expensive %%cmp_ta%% acquiring the same content through C7%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Thus its bid was %%sqt%% predatory %%sqt%%%%per%% 
2175 The second ]^[ third of the anti%%dsh%%competitive means combined to make Foxtel%%sqt%%s bid ]f[ the AFL pay television rights (through News) more attractive to the AFL%%lst%% even %%cmp_if%% C7 were to match it on price%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In particular%%lst%% C7 could ]n[ match an important feature of Foxtel%%sqt%%s bid%%lst%% namely that Foxtel could guarantee the availability of live AFL content to a large subscriber base%%lst%% whereas C7 could offer no such assurance%%per%% 
2176 Seven also submits that certain aspects of the Master Agreement Provision had %%sqt%% an anti%%dsh%%competitive tendency %%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In particular%%lst%% the %%sqt%% tying %%sqt%% of Foxtel%%sqt%%s acquisition of the AFL pay television rights with the bid by Nine ]^[ Ten ]f[ the AFL free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air rights ]^[ the %%sqt%% bundling %%sqt%% of News%%sqt%% media support with the bid ]f[ the AFL broadcasting rights gave the News offer features that Seven%%sqt%%s bid could ]n[ match%%per%% 
13%%per%%4%%per%%7 Effect on the Wholesale Sports Channel Market 
2177 Seven submits that one effect ]v[ likely effect of the Master Agreement Provision (and the other provisions upon which it relies) was a substantial lessening of competition in the wholesale sports channel market%%per%% 
13%%per%%4%%per%%8 Effect on the AFL ]^[ NRL Pay Rights Markets 
2178 The likely ]^[ actual effect of the demise of C7 (itself a likely result of the Master Agreement Provision ]^[ other provisions relied on by Seven) was that there would only be one potential purchaser of the AFL pay television rights ]^[ the NRL pay television rights%%lst%% namely Foxtel/Fox Sports%%per%%]$~

2180 Perhaps ]n[ surprisingly%%lst%% given the thrust of Seven%%sqt%%s submissions%%lst%% this issue received (relatively) little attention in the written ]^[ oral submissions ]^[ the arguments were ]n[ systematically developed%%per%%]$~

~$[When I asked Mr Sumption during his closing address to clarify Seven%%sqt%%s position%%lst%% should I find that there was no wholesale sports channel market%%lst%% his initial response was that he could ]n[ see how Seven%%sqt%%s s 45(2) effects case could succeed%%per%%]$~ 
~$[However%%lst%% he subsequently modified that response%%lst%% stating that Seven could %%sqt%% succeed only on the basis of the knock%%dsh%%on effects in the retail pay [television] market %%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Sumption referred to Seven%%sqt%%s written submissions ]f[ further elaboration of the argument%%per%% 
2181 In the written submissions%%lst%% Seven contends that Foxtel%%sqt%%s acquisition in December 2000 of the AFL pay television rights%%lst%% together with C7%%sqt%%s failure to secure the NRL pay television rights%%lst%% had the effect ]v[ likely effect of substantially lessening competition in the retail pay television market%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Seven gives two reasons ]f[ this contention%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%(a) Optus became dependent upon its competitor%%lst%% Foxtel%%lst%% ]f[ the supply of key programming%%lst%% with the terms of that supply fixed by Foxtel%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Optus was as a result less able to compete effectively with Foxtel in circumstances where Foxtel exercised a substantial measure of control over the price ]^[ other terms of the supply of key programming which Optus needed to compete%%scn%%

~$[Seven acknowledges that the effect of the acquisition of the AFL pay television rights was (on its contentions) %%sqt%% predominantly anti%%dsh%%competitive at the channel supply level %%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Seven maintains%%lst%% nonetheless%%lst%% that there was also an anti%%dsh%%competitive effect at the retail pay television level%%per%% 
2182 Seven relies on the evidence of Dr Switkowski that he thought that Foxtel had obtained a strategic advantage in relation to Optus%%lst%% as a pay television provider%%lst%% by controlling AFL content ]^[ that Foxtel had increased its prospects of out%%dsh%%competing Optus%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Seven also relies on the evidence of Professor Noll ]^[ Dr Smith to the effect that the rights acquisition gave Foxtel a %%sqt%% gate%%dsh%%keeper %%sqt%% role in respect of AFL programming ]^[ that this permitted Foxtel to determine conditions of access to such programming by Optus ]^[ Austar%%per%%]$~ 
~$[With fewer resources available to engage in pro%%dsh%%competitive conduct%%lst%% Optus ]^[ Austar would have been less of a competitive constraint %%cmp_ta%% had Foxtel ]n[ acquired the AFL pay television rights%%per%%

2191 Secondly%%lst%% the Respondents dispute the existence of the Master Agreement ]^[ %%cmp_h%% the Master Agreement Provision%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In substance%%lst%% as I have noted%%lst%% the Respondents contend that there was no understanding reached at the teleconference of 13 December 2000 that the AFL Proposal ]^[ the NRL Proposal (as pleaded) would be carried out together%%per%%]$~ 
~$[According to the Respondents%%lst%% the proposals were %%sqt%% coincident in time %%sqt%% ]b[ otherwise unconnected%%per%% 
2192 PBL (supported by News) also disputes the existence of the Rights Sub%%dsh%%Licence Agreement (which Seven says was entered into at the time the Foxtel%%lst%% Nine ]^[ Ten Puts were executed)%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Otherwise there is no dispute as to the existence of the contracts ]v[ understandings relied on by Seven%%per%% 
13%%per%%5%%per%%3 Competition on the Merits 
2193 Thirdly%%lst%% the Respondents say that the ordinary workings of the competitive process%%lst%% even %%cmp_if%% it means the elimination of a competitor%%lst%% cannot substantially lessen competition in a market%%per%%]$~ 
~$[This submission is related to the question of the time at which the anti%%dsh%%competitive effect of a provision is to be assessed%%per%%]$~ 
~$[However%%lst%% the Respondents also argue that the test of whether a provision has the effect ]v[ likely effect of substantially lessening competition must be formulated ]^[ applied in a manner which does ]n[ strike down conduct simply %%cmp_b%% it happens to damage a particular firm%%per%%]$~ 
~$[They adopt Professor Hay%%sqt%%s observation that%%cln%%

13%%per%%5%%per%%4 Agreements Did Not Cause Seven%%sqt%%s Demise 
2195 Fourthly%%lst%% the Respondents submit that it is necessary %%lst%% ]b[ ]n[ sufficient %%lst%% ]f[ Seven to establish that the various provisions on which it relies%%lst%% assessed at the time the relevant contracts ]v[ understandings were entered into%%lst%% had the effect ]v[ likely effect of putting C7 out of business ]v[ causing it to become an ineffective competitor%%per%% 
13%%per%%5%%per%%5 Master Agreement Provision Did Not Have the Alleged Effect on Competition 
2196 Fifthly%%lst%% the Respondents contend that the effect ]v[ likely effect of a provision of a contract%%lst%% arrangement ]v[ understanding is to be assessed at the time the provision came into force ]v[ existence%%per%%]$~ 
~$[On this basis%%lst%% they say that it was ]n[ an effect ]v[ likely effect of the Master Agreement Provision (if there was such a provision) that News would acquire the AFL broadcasting rights ]v[ that Fox Sports would acquire the NRL pay television rights%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The %%sqt%% direct ]v[ immediate %%sqt%% effect of the Master Agreement Provision%%lst%% at most%%lst%% was that bids would be made at particular prices ]f[ the AFL ]^[ NRL pay television rights%%per%%]$~

~$[In particular%%lst%% it was ]n[ likely that News would succeed %%cmp_if%% Seven was prepared to make a competitive bid ]f[ the AFL pay television rights%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The Respondents contend that News%%sqt%% bid succeeded only %%cmp_b%% Seven chose ]n[ to make a competitive bid ]f[ the AFL pay television rights%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The absence of such a bid from Seven was ]n[ something that was likely at the time the Master Agreement Provision came into existence%%per%% 
2198 News%%lst%% supported by the other Consortium Respondents%%lst%% submits that%%lst%% in any event%%lst%% the Master Agreement Provision (and other provisions) had no effect on the acquisition by Fox Sports of the NRL pay television rights%%per%%

2199 Finally%%lst%% the Respondents submit that the contracts ]v[ arrangements did ]n[ have the effect ]v[ likely effect of substantially lessening competition in any relevant market%%per%%]$~ 
~$[PBL%%lst%% supported by the other Consortium Respondents%%lst%% submits that%%lst%% on the assumption that all their other arguments are rejected%%lst%% none of the provisions had the effect ]v[ likely effect required by s 45(2) of the TP Act %%per%%

~$[Austar%%lst%% instead of receiving AFL coverage via Foxtel would have received it from C7 on much the same terms (that is%%lst%% about $2%%per%%00 pspm on a tier)%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Optus would have continued to acquire C7 on the onerous terms of the C7%%dsh%%Optus CSA (that is%%lst%% subject to the MSG of $30 million per annum)%%per%% 
2203 Insofar as Seven%%sqt%%s complaint is that the acquisition of the AFL pay television rights in 2000 caused Optus to enter the Foxtel%%dsh%%Optus CSA in March 2002%%lst%% there was no causal relationship between the two%%per%%]$~ 
~$[If Seven had successfully retained the AFL broadcasting rights ]v[ the AFL pay television rights in 2000%%lst%% the parties to the Foxtel%%dsh%%Optus CSA would have had the same incentive to enter that arrangement%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The notion of a single supplier of content to all pay television platforms was considered as early as 1997 ]^[ Optus%%sqt%% strategy until 2001 was that sporting content should be available non%%dsh%%exclusively on all retail platforms%%per%%]$~

2205 Section 45(2)(a)(ii) prohibits a corporation from making a contract ]v[ arrangement%%lst%% ]v[ arriving at an understanding%%lst%% %%cmp_if%% a provision of the proposed contract%%lst%% arrangement ]v[ understanding 
(a) has the purpose%%scn%% ]v[ 
(b) would have the effect%%scn%% ]v[

2206 The prohibition on the making of a %%sqt%% contract %%sqt%% (using that expression to incorporate making an arrangement ]v[ arriving at an understanding) %%cmp_tf%% applies in three separate circumstances%%lst%% each of which is defined by reference to the characteristics of a provision of the proposed contract%%per%%

(d) has the purpose%%scn%% ]v[

2208 The prohibition on giving effect to a provision of a contract %%cmp_tf%% also applies in three separate circumstances%%lst%% each of which is defined by reference to the characteristics of the provision of the contract%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Giving effect to a provision of a contract includes (s 4(1)) doing an act ]v[ thing in pursuance of ]v[ in accordance with%%lst%% ]v[ enforcing ]v[ purporting to enforce%%lst%% the provision%%per%% 
13%%per%%6%%per%%2%%per%%2 COMMON GROUND 
2209 It appears to be common ground that the prohibition in s 45(2)(a)(ii) on making a contract containing a provision which would have ]v[ be likely to have the effect of substantially lessening competition requires the application of a %%sqt%% wholly prospective %%sqt%% test (Mr Sumption%%sqt%%s words)%%per%%]$~ 
~$[This follows from the fact that the effect of a contract which%%lst%% by hypothesis%%lst%% is unimplemented%%lst%% can only be judged prospectively%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The drafting of s 45(2)(a)(ii) reflects this reality%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The statutory prohibition is directed to the making of a contract%%lst%% where a provision of the proposed contract would have ]v[ be likely to have the proscribed anti%%dsh%%competitive effect%%per%% 
2210 It is also common ground%%lst%% at least ]s[ far as the proceedings before me are concerned%%lst%% that the expression in s 45(2)(a)(ii) of the TP Act %%sqt%% would %%per%%%%per%%%%per%% be likely to have the effect %%sqt%% of substantially lessening competition means a real chance ]v[ possibility of having that effect%%per%% 
(I refer to the principal authorities below ([2231]%%dsh%%[2233])%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It seems to me to follow that the quoted expression widens the scope of the prohibition in s 45(2)(a)(ii)%%per%%]$~ 
~$[If that expression had ]n[ been incorporated in s 45(2)(a)(ii)%%lst%% the prohibition would have applied only to the making of a contract %%cmp_if%% a provision of the proposed contract %%sqt%% would have %%sqt%% the effect of substantially lessening competition%%per%%]$~ 
~$[A statute in that form would require proof of the specified effect on the usual standard%%cln%% that is%%lst%% on the balance of probabilities%%per%% 
2211 That the expression widens the scope of s 45(2)(a)(ii) is consistent with the well%%dsh%%known judgment of Deane J in Tillmanns Butcheries Pty Ltd v Australasian Meat Industry Employees%%sqt%% Union (1979) 27 ALR 367%%lst%% to which both Seven ]^[ the Respondents refer in their submissions%%per%%]$~ 
~$[That case concerned the secondary boycott provisions of s 45D%%lst%% which proscribed certain conduct that would have ]v[ be likely to have the effect of causing substantial loss ]v[ damage to a business%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Deane J said this (27 ALR%%lst%% at 381%%dsh%%382)%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%Section 45D(1) proscribes conduct only %%cmp_if%% it be engaged in ]f[ the purpose of causing loss ]v[ damage to the business of the relevant corporation%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Even though conduct be engaged in ]f[ such a purpose it will be outside the proscription contained in the sub%%dsh%%section unless it %%dqt%%would have ]v[ be likely to have%%dqt%% that effect%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Plainly the reference to %%dqt%%would be likely to have%%dqt%% is meant to convey a lower degree of likelihood %%cmp_ta%% the reference to %%dqt%%would have%%dqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In the case where conduct has ]n[ occurred%%lst%% a court would be constrained to determine whether conduct %%dqt%%would have%%dqt%% the specified effect by reference to the ordinary standard of whether it was more likely %%cmp_ta%% ]n[ that it would%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In such a case%%lst%% %%cmp_if%% %%dqt%%likely%%dqt%% is interpreted as meaning %%dqt%%more likely %%cmp_ta%% not%%dqt%%%%lst%% it would add little to the practical scope of the section%%per%%]$~ 
~$[On the other hand%%lst%% %%cmp_if%% conduct had run its ordinary course ]^[ had ]n[ had the specified effect%%lst%% it would be ]b[ rarely that a court would feel justified in disregarding the lesson of the event ]^[ finding that while the conduct did ]n[ have the specified effect it had been more likely %%cmp_ta%% ]n[ that it would have that effect (see per Dixon J in Willis v Commonwealth [1946] HCA 22 %%scn%% (1946) 73 CLR 105 at 116)%%sqt%%%%per%% 
2212 The reference to Willis v Commonwealth in this passage is to a comment made by Dixon J in the context of a damages claim by a woman in respect of her husband%%sqt%%s death%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Dixon J said that%%lst%% where the facts concerning remarriage are available (the widow remarried five months after her husband%%sqt%%s death)%%lst%% they are to be preferred to prophecies (73 CLR%%lst%% at 116)%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In the light of Deane J%%sqt%%s analysis%%lst%% I do ]n[ read the reference to Willis v Commonwealth to mean that%%lst%% in assessing the likely effect of conduct (in the sense of a real chance ]v[ possibility) at a given time%%lst%% the actual course of events necessarily determines the outcome of the assessment%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Rather%%lst%% the actual course of events is to be taken into account in making the assessment of likelihood at the relevant date%%per%% 
13%%per%%6%%per%%2%%per%%3 PREFERRED CONSTRUCTION OF S 45(2)( b)(ii) 
2213 As Seven points out%%lst%% s 45(2)(b)(ii) of the TP Act %%lst%% in contrast to s 45(2)(a)(ii)%%lst%% uses the present tense to describe the proscribed conduct%%lst%% namely giving effect to a provision of a contract %%cmp_if%% the provision has ]v[ is likely to have the effect of substantially lessening competition%%per%%]$~ 
~$[But in my opinion%%lst%% contrary to Seven%%sqt%%s submission%%lst%% this language does ]n[ imply that the prohibition applies whenever a provision to which a corporation gives effect %%sqt%% causes %%sqt%% a substantial lessening of competition in a market%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In particular%%lst%% the language does ]n[ imply that s 45(2)(b)(ii) is contravened by giving effect to a provision where%%lst%% as events subsequently turn out%%lst%% the provision can be said to have %%sqt%% caused %%sqt%% a substantial lessening of competition in a market%%per%% 
2214 In my view%%lst%% the use of the present tense in s 45(2)(b)(ii) of the TP Act is explained by the fact that the subparagraph applies where a corporation gives effect to a provision of an existing contract (or arrangement ]v[ understanding)%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In contrast to s 45(2)(a)(ii)%%lst%% s 45(2)(b)(ii) assumes that a contract is in force at the time the proscribed conduct (giving effect to a provision of the contract) takes place%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Indeed%%lst%% the paragraph expressly contemplates that the contract might even have been made before s 45(2) of the TP Act was itself enacted%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Consequently%%lst%% the proscribed conduct may take place long after the contract itself was made%%per%%]$~ 
~$[For example%%lst%% in Dowling v Dalgety Australia Ltd (1992) 34 FCR 109%%lst%% the contract (containing the rules of the Goondiwindi Livestock Auction Sales Association) was made in 1965%%lst%% ]b[ the conduct complained of did ]n[ occur until 1985%%lst%% two decades later%%per%% 
2216 The divergence in language between s 45(2)(a)(ii) ]^[ (b)(ii) does ]n[ indicate%%lst%% in my opinion%%lst%% an intention to introduce what can be described as a retrospective causation test of the kind suggested by Mr Sumption%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Use of the word %%sqt%% has %%sqt%% in s 45(2)(b)(ii) acknowledges that%%lst%% once a contract is in force%%lst%% it may be possible to determine%%lst%% by reference to a particular time%%lst%% that a provision of the contract already has the effect of substantially lessening competition%%per%% 
(The use of the word %%sqt%% has %%sqt%% instead of %%sqt%% has had %%sqt%% reflects the fact that a provision may have a continuing effect on competition%%per%% 
) The expression %%sqt%% is likely to have %%sqt%% indicates an intention to prohibit a corporation from giving effect to a provision in a contract where the provision%%lst%% at the time the corporation engages in the conduct%%lst%% is likely to have the effect of substantially lessening competition%%per%% 
2217 This construction of s 45(2)(b)(ii) of the TP Act explains the apparent shift in language within s 45(2)%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It is also consistent with the authorities%%lst%% such as Tillmanns Butcheries v AMIEU %%lst%% that interpret the references in s 45(2) to the likely effect of a provision on competition as broadening the scope of the statutory prohibitions%%per%%]$~ 
~$[If Seven%%sqt%%s construction is correct%%lst%% an applicant would generally ]n[ be concerned about the likely effect of a provision to which the respondent has given effect%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It would be much more straightforward in the typical case to attempt to demonstrate that the provision ultimately %%sqt%% caused %%sqt%% a substantial lessening of competition ]^[ that the lessening of competition was ]n[ the consequence of a supervening independent event%%per%% 
2218 Furthermore%%lst%% %%cmp_if%% Seven is correct%%lst%% an applicant need ]n[ show that%%lst%% at the time the respondent gave effect to the provision%%lst%% it was even likely (in the sense that there was a real chance) that the provision would have the effect of substantially lessening competition%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The inquiry ceases to be prospective ]^[ no longer focuses on the circumstances that prevailed at the time the alleged conduct took place%%per%% 
2219 It must be remembered that a contravention of s 45(2) can attract civil penalties%%cln%% s 76(1)%%per%%]$~ 
~$[On Seven%%sqt%%s approach%%lst%% a corporation can be penalised ]f[ giving effect to a provision which%%lst%% with the benefit of hindsight%%lst%% caused a substantial lessening of competition%%per%%]$~ 
~$[A penalty can be imposed regardless of whether such an outcome was likely at the time the corporation gave effect to the provision%%per%%]$~ 
~$[As I point out in Chapter 14 ([2404])%%lst%% this is ]n[ a conclusion that should be reached lightly %%cmp_if%% another construction is ]n[ merely plausible%%lst%% ]b[ is entirely consistent with the statutory language%%per%% 
2220 I do ]n[ think it is an answer to suggest%%lst%% as Mr Sumption did%%lst%% that a corporation alleged to have contravened s 45(2)(b)(ii) by giving effect to a provision could have applied to the ACCC ]f[ an exemption under s 88 of the TP Act %%per%%]$~ 
~$[That course assumes that the corporation appreciates that giving effect to a particular provision might have the effect of substantially lessening competition%%per%%]$~ 
~$[If%%lst%% viewed prospectively%%lst%% there is no real chance of the provision substantially lessening competition%%lst%% the corporation is ]n[ likely to appreciate that giving effect to the provision will in fact substantially lessen competition%%per%% 
2221 The construction I favour does ]n[ mean that events which post%%dsh%%date the televant conduct cannot be considered in determining whether the provision concerned was likely to have the effect of substantially lessening competition%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Subsequent events may shed considerable light on what was likely at the material time%%per%%]$~ 
~$[As Deane J concluded in Tillmanns Butcheries v AMIEU %%lst%% it would be odd %%cmp_if%% the actual course of events could ]n[ be taken into account in determining what was the likely effect of a provision at a particular time%%per%%]$~ 
~$[But that is ]n[ the same thing as applying a causation test in the manner proposed by Seven%%per%% 
2222 The analysis thus far leads to the conclusion that s 45(2)(b)(ii) of the TP Act requires the likely effect of a provision to be assessed at the date the allegedly contravening conduct takes place %%dsh%%%%dsh%%%%dsh%% that is%%lst%% the date the corporation gives effect to a provision of the contract ]v[ arrangement%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It is perhaps arguable that the assessment of the likely effect should be made at the date the original contract ]v[ arrangement was made%%lst%% rather %%cmp_ta%% on the date the corporation gives effect to a provision of the contract ]v[ arrangement%%per%%]$~ 
~$[News submits that this is the preferable approach%%lst%% ]b[ does ]n[ develop the argument%%per%% 
2223 It may ]n[ make a great deal of difference in the present case which of the two dates is chosen ]f[ the purpose of applying s 45(2)(b)(ii)%%lst%% since the Master Agreement Provision specifically contemplated a number of further agreements should either ]v[ both of the bids have succeeded%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In any event%%lst%% I think the better construction of s 45(2)(b)(ii) is that the relevant time ]f[ assessing the likely effect on competition of a provision is the date the alleged contravenor gives effect to the provision%%per%%]$~ 
~$[This conclusion applies to the conduct of the Consortium Respondents in giving effect to the Master Agreement Provision%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The same principle applies to Seven%%sqt%%s case based on the Consortium Respondents (or some of them) giving effect to provisions in other contracts%%lst%% arrangements ]v[ understandings%%per%%

~$[However%%lst%% none of the authorities appears to be precisely in point%%lst%% since the particular argument advanced by Seven does ]n[ seem to have been put in the earlier cases%%per%% 
2225 There are judicial observations which%%lst%% taken in isolation%%lst%% support the Respondents%%sqt%% position%%per%%]$~ 
~$[For example%%lst%% in Trade Practices Commission v TNT Management Pty Ltd (1985) 6 FCR 1%%lst%% Franki J considered the expression %%sqt%% has ]v[ is likely to have a significant effect on competition %%sqt%%%%lst%% which %%cmp_t%% appeared in s 45(4) of the TP Act %%per%%]$~ 
~$[His Honour said this (6 FCR%%lst%% at 49%%dsh%%50)%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%I consider that %%dqt%%is%%dqt%% differs somewhat from %%dqt%%would be%%dqt%% ]^[ that the question must be answered by looking at the position at ]v[ about the time of the arrangements ]v[ understandings under consideration were made ]v[ entered into %%per%%%%per%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The word %%dqt%%has%%dqt%% requires the question to be tested against the established facts whereas the words %%dqt%%likely to have%%dqt%%%%lst%% while referring to the period at ]v[ about the time when the arrangement was made ]v[ the understanding entered into%%lst%% allows any reasonable inference to be drawn%%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[However%%lst%% these comments were made in relation to a repealed provision of the TP Act which%%lst%% in any event%%lst%% has since been heavily amended%%per%% 
2226 Seven also refers to judicial observations which%%lst%% taken in isolation%%lst%% perhaps appear to support its view%%per%%]$~ 
~$[For example%%lst%% in Dowling v Dalgety 34 FCR%%lst%% at 134%%lst%% Lockhart J noted that the %%sqt%% effect of a contract is a relatively simple concept requiring examination of the results %%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[However%%lst%% I do ]n[ understand Lockhart J to have decided that s 45(2)(b)(ii) incorporates a causation test of the kind urged on behalf of Seven in these proceedings%%per%%]$~

13%%per%%6%%per%%3 Effect%%cln%% Direct ]^[ Immediate? 
2228 The Respondents submit that the %%sqt%% effect %%sqt%% to which s 45(2) refers %%sqt%% generally is the direct ]v[ immediate effect of the agreement ]v[ provision %%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[They rely on the reasoning of the Trade Practices Tribunal (Deane J%%lst%% Mr H N Walker ]^[ Professor Maureen Brunt) in Re Application by Concrete Carters Association (Victoria) (1977) 31 FLR 193%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The Tribunal in that case dealt with an application ]f[ an authorisation by an association of owner%%dsh%%drivers%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The association sought authorisation ]f[ a contract with the producers of pre%%dsh%%mixed concrete which regulated the rates ]^[ conditions ]f[ the carriage of such concrete%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The association argued that in the absence of authorisation the unions representing the owner%%dsh%%drivers would achieve much the same result by industry%%dsh%%wide negotiations%%per%% 
2229 The Tribunal rejected this argument (31 FLR%%lst%% at 206)%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%It was common ground between the applicants ]^[ the commission %%dsh%%%%dsh%%%%dsh%% ]^[ it would seem rightly ]s[ %%dsh%%%%dsh%%%%dsh%% that the proposed conduct of the applicants (some of whom are corporations) involving as it does the negotiation with the producers (which are all corporations) of industry%%dsh%%wide rates ]^[ conditions ]f[ the provision ]^[ acquisition of the services of the applicants%%lst%% would%%lst%% in the absence of authorization%%lst%% involve a contravention of the provisions of s%%per%% 45 %%per%%%%per%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The likely direct ]v[ immediate effect of an agreement ]v[ arrangement between the applicants ]^[ producers as to industry%%dsh%%wide rates ]^[ conditions pursuant to which the applicants would carry the product would be a substantial lessening of competition in relation to rates ]^[ conditions in the market in which the applicants operate%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It is possible that%%lst%% upon analysis ]^[ overall assessment%%lst%% the detriment to the public constituted by any such lessening of competition would%%lst%% as the applicants maintain%%lst%% be insignificant ]v[ negligible ]f[ the reason that in the absence of the agreement ]v[ arrangement%%lst%% competition would be lessened to a similar ]v[ greater extent by other factors which would %%cmp_t%% become legitimately operative%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Such an overall assessment ]v[ analysis is%%lst%% of course%%lst%% vital in assessing the detriment to competition which is to be put into the scales in the ultimate weighing process%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It does ]n[ however alter the fact that the direct ]^[ immediate effect of the agreement ]v[ arrangement would be a substantial lessening of competition%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It is%%lst%% in our view%%lst%% to this direct ]^[ immediate effect that the provisions of s%%per%% 45 refer %%sqt%%%%per%%

2230 In my opinion%%lst%% the decision in Re Concrete Carters Association does ]n[ support the proposition that only the direct ]^[ immediate effect of a provision is to be taken into account in determining whether the effect includes a substantial lessening of competition%%per%%]$~

~$[Nor do I think the observations of Franki J in TPC v TNT 6 FCR%%lst%% at 49%%dsh%%50%%lst%% which were directed to s 45 prior to its amendment in 1977%%lst%% advance matters%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Moreover%%lst%% there is no textual warrant ]f[ limiting the operation of s 45(2) in this way%%per%%]$~

2237 It seems to be common ground that this is the question that should be asked in the present case%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The answer to that question%%lst%% as with the assessment of a %%sqt%% likely %%sqt%% effect%%lst%% requires a qualitative judgment%%cln%% AGL v ACCC 137 FCR%%lst%% at 417 [351]%%lst%% per French J%%per%%]$~ 
~$[That judgment must take into account s 4G of the TP Act %%lst%% which requires references to the lessening of competition to be read as including preventing ]v[ hindering competition%%per%%]$~

~$[But the success ]v[ otherwise of News%%sqt%% bid ]f[ the AFL broadcasting rights depended on the approach ]v[ approaches taken by Seven to the rights%%per%%]$~

13%%per%%9 Effect of the Master Agreement Provision on the Retail Pay Television Market 
2269 As I have noted%%lst%% Seven%%sqt%%s submissions do ]n[ systematically develop the contention that the Master Agreement Provision (and the other provisions on which Seven relies) had the effect proscribed by s 45(2) of the TP Act %%per%%]$~ 
~$[One difficulty is to determine what is left of that contention once Seven%%sqt%%s suggested construction of s 45(2)(b)(ii) is rejected%%per%%]$~ 
~$[For example%%lst%% Seven argues that%%lst%% ]b[ ]f[ News%%sqt%% ]^[ Fox Sports%%sqt%% acquisition of the AFL broadcasting ]^[ NRL pay television rights%%lst%% Optus would ]n[ have entered the Foxtel%%dsh%%Optus CSA ]^[ %%cmp_tf%% the anti%%dsh%%competitive effect of that agreement would ]n[ have occurred%%per%%]$~ 
~$[This argument appears to assume%%lst%% in my view incorrectly%%lst%% that a corporation contravenes s 45(2)(b)(ii) %%cmp_if%% it gives effect to a provision which%%lst%% in the light of subsequent events%%lst%% can be said to have %%sqt%% caused %%sqt%% a substantial lessening of competition in a particular market%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Another difficulty is that Seven%%sqt%%s submissions concerning the effect of the Master Agreement Provision on the retail pay television market do ]n[ make it clear how far%%lst%% %%cmp_if%% at all%%lst%% Seven intends to rely ]n[ only on s 45(2)(b)(ii)%%lst%% ]b[ on s 45(2)(a)(ii)%%per%% 
2270 It is asking a great deal of a Judge%%lst%% especially in a complex case such as this%%lst%% in effect to reformulate submissions ]s[ that they conform to what is ultimately held to be the correct construction of the relevant statutes%%per%%]$~

13%%per%%9%%per%%1 Application of s 45(2)(a)(ii)%%cln%% Was It Likely That News Would Acquire the AFL Broadcasting Rights?

~$[The issue%%lst%% %%cmp_t%%%%lst%% ]s[ far as the Master Agreement Provision is concerned%%lst%% is whether there was a real chance that it would substantially lessen competition in the retail pay television market%%per%%]$~ 
~$[That question is to be answered at the time the Master Agreement was made (that is%%lst%% 13 December 2000)%%per%%]$~ 
~$[However%%lst%% the assessment should take into account subsequent events%%lst%% although these do ]n[ necessarily determine what was %%sqt%% likely %%sqt%% at the relevant time%%per%%]$~ 
~$[As I have explained%%lst%% assessing whether there was a real chance that the Master Agreement Provision would substantially lessen competition in the retail pay television market requires a qualitative judgment of the kind identified by French J in AGL v ACCC %%per%% 
13%%per%%9%%per%%1%%per%%2 SEVEN FAILS TO PUT ITS BEST BID FORWARD 
2273 In my view%%lst%% both assumptions are ]n[ without difficulties%%lst%% especially the first%%per%%]$~ 
~$[This is %%cmp_b%% at the time the Consortium Respondents entered into the Master Agreement%%lst%% neither they nor any objective observer could reasonably have anticipated that Seven would fail to take whatever steps were commercially necessary ]^[ feasible to maximise its chances of obtaining the AFL pay television rights%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Yet that is precisely what happened%%per%% 
2274 In a case which has many extraordinary features%%lst%% perhaps the most extraordinary is that Seven has consistently maintained that securing the AFL pay television rights was essential to C7%%sqt%%s commercial survival after 2001%%lst%% ]y[ the evidence clearly establishes that Seven failed to make its best offer ]f[ those rights%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Stokes admitted that News had secured the AFL pay television rights ]f[ a %%sqt%% good %%sqt%% price ]^[ that there was no impediment to Seven matching News%%sqt%% bid in a timely fashion%%per%%]$~ 
~$[On Mr Stokes%%sqt%% own analysis of the content of the AFL pay television rights secured by News%%lst%% his assessment that the price paid by News was %%sqt%% good %%sqt%% was an understatement%%per%% 
2275 Seven%%sqt%%s failure to maximise its chances of securing the AFL pay television rights was primarily due to two factors%%per%%]$~ 
~$[One was an apparent misinterpretation of the First ]^[ Last Deed%%lst%% which led Mr Stokes ]^[ others within Seven to assume that Seven would have a second opportunity to secure the AFL pay television rights%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The second factor was Seven%%sqt%%s adamant refusal%%lst%% ]f[ tactical reasons%%lst%% to contemplate separate bids ]f[ the free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air ]^[ pay television rights (remembering that the content of the pay television rights can vary according to constraints imposed either by the potential licensor ]v[ the potential licensee)%%per%%]$~ 
~$[As Mr Wise explained%%lst%% Seven%%sqt%%s insistence on bidding ]f[ all rights had its origins in Seven%%sqt%%s belief that no%%dsh%%one %%cmp_e%% was likely to be interested in the free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air rights ]^[ that a bid ]f[ both sets of rights would %%cmp_tf%% increase Seven%%sqt%%s chances of obtaining the pay television rights without competitive bidding%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Seven%%sqt%%s refusal to countenance a separate bid ]f[ the AFL pay television rights continued until the AFL had already announced its decision to award the rights to News%%per%%]$~ 
~$[At that point%%lst%% Mr Stokes changed his mind ]^[ indicated that Seven was prepared to make an offer ]f[ the AFL pay television rights alone that in substance matched the pay rights component of News%%sqt%% offer%%per%% 
2276 In my view%%lst%% %%cmp_if%% the chances of News ]^[ Fox Sports obtaining both sets of pay television rights is assessed as at 13 December 2000%%lst%% there was no reason ]f[ any of the Consortium Respondents or%%lst%% ]f[ that matter%%lst%% any objective observer to think that Seven would ]n[ take every reasonable commercial step available to it to secure the AFL pay television rights%%per%% 
13%%per%%9%%per%%1%%per%%3 WAS IT LIKELY THAT NEWS%%sqt%% BID WOULD SUCCEED? 
2277 In assessing whether there was a real chance on 13 December 2000 that News would obtain the AFL pay television rights%%lst%% it is also necessary to consider the precise content of the Master Agreement Provision%%per%%]$~ 
~$[As I have explained%%lst%% the understanding reached at the teleconference of 13 December 2000 was ]n[ that the Consortium Respondents would do whatever was required to obtain the AFL broadcasting rights (including the pay television rights) ]^[ the NRL pay television rights%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The arrangement%%lst%% ]s[ far as the AFL broadcasting rights were concerned%%lst%% was that News should make a bid ]f[ the rights ]^[ that its bid should be supported by the various put options ]^[ other arrangements agreed at the meeting%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In particular%%lst%% the Master Agreement Provision contemplated the execution of the Foxtel Put by which Foxtel undertook to acquire the AFL pay television rights (comprising three exclusively live matches) ]f[ $30 million per annum (plus adjustments)%%per%%]$~ 
~$[There was nothing in the arrangement ]v[ understanding that required ]v[ even contemplated that News%%sqt%% bid%%lst%% insofar as it embraced the AFL pay television rights%%lst%% would preclude Seven from making a superior offer ]f[ these rights%%lst%% %%cmp_if%% it chose to do so%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Stokes%%sqt%% evidence made it clear that the Foxtel Put was ]n[ set at a fee that was higher %%cmp_ta%% reasonable commercial considerations could justify%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The AFL bidding process involved the making of sealed bids ]^[ there was nothing that prevented Seven from matching ]v[ exceeding News%%sqt%% bid %%cmp_if%% it chose to do so%%per%% 
2278 Of course%%lst%% the fact is that News did acquire the AFL broadcasting rights%%lst%% including the AFL pay television rights (as defined in News%%sqt%% bid)%%per%%]$~ 
~$[To conclude that the Master Agreement Provision%%lst%% as at 13 December 2000%%lst%% would ]n[ be likely to have the effect that News ]^[ Fox Sports would acquire between them both the AFL ]^[ NRL pay television rights %%cmp_tf%% seems to be odd%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The apparent oddity dissipates somewhat when it is recognised that Seven itself was essentially responsible ]f[ the demise of C7 by reason of its failure to maximise its chances of securing the very rights that it considered central to C7%%sqt%%s commercial survival%%per%%]$~ 
~$[There was nothing in the Master Agreement Provision that was intended to dissuade Seven from putting its best offer forward ]f[ the AFL broadcasting rights ]v[ ]f[ the AFL pay television rights or%%lst%% indeed%%lst%% that had such an effect%%per%% 
2279 It is true%%lst%% as Seven points out%%lst%% that the AFL%%sqt%%s decision to accept News%%sqt%% offer was influenced by factors other %%cmp_ta%% price%%per%%]$~ 
~$[However%%lst%% in the AFL%%sqt%%s words%%lst%% News%%sqt%% bid was %%sqt%% clearly a financially superior offer %%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[This was the most important consideration ]f[ the AFL%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Had Seven offered significantly more ]f[ the AFL pay television rights %%cmp_ta%% News%%lst%% the AFL would have been extremely unlikely to refuse the superior financial offer%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In any event%%lst%% had Seven determined to do everything reasonable within its power to secure the AFL pay television rights%%lst%% it would certainly have addressed any non%%dsh%%monetary issues that were of concern to the AFL%%per%% 
2280 It follows that %%cmp_if%% the matters are viewed objectively as at 13 December 2000%%lst%% no objective observer could reasonably have anticipated that Seven would fail to take commercial steps well open to it to secure the AFL pay television rights offered by the AFL%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Had Seven taken those steps%%lst%% I think that the strong likelihood is that it would have succeeded in securing the rights it considered ]s[ important to the survival of its pay television arm%%per%% 
2281 That finding%%lst%% however%%lst%% does ]n[ resolve the question posed by s 45(2)(a)(ii) of the TP Act adversely to Seven%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The question is whether Seven has established that on 13 December 2000 there was a likelihood%%lst%% in the sense of a real chance%%lst%% that the Master Agreement Provision would have the effect of depriving Seven of both the AFL ]^[ NRL pay television rights%%per%%]$~ 
~$[As to the NRL pay television rights%%lst%% it was plainly more %%cmp_ta%% likely that Fox Sports would succeed in its bid%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In relation to the AFL pay television rights%%lst%% the fact is that the parties to the Master Agreement spent a good deal of time ]^[ effort in formulating a bid that was intended to have a very good commercial chance of succeeding ]^[ in fact did succeed%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In these circumstances%%lst%% I think that Seven has shown that the Master Agreement Provision was likely (in the requisite sense) to have the effect that News would acquire the AFL broadcasting rights (including the pay television rights) ]^[ that Seven would ]n[ acquire those rights%%per%% 
2282 In my opinion%%lst%% insofar as Seven%%sqt%%s failure to acquire the AFL pay television rights was critical to the fate of C7%%lst%% Seven was largely the author of its own misfortune%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Nonetheless%%lst%% I consider that Seven has made out that the likely effect of the Master Agreement Provision%%lst%% assessed as at 13 December 2000%%lst%% was that News would acquire the AFL broadcasting rights ]^[ that Foxtel%%lst%% through News%%sqt%% exercise of the Foxtel Put%%lst%% would take a sub%%dsh%%licence of the AFL pay television rights%%per%% 
2283 I also assume ]f[ the purpose of considering the effect of the Master Agreement Provision%%lst%% without deciding the point%%lst%% that Seven can establish that C7%%sqt%%s failure to acquire either the AFL ]v[ NRL pay television rights led to its demise%%per%% 
13%%per%%9%%per%%2 Application of s 45(2)%%cln%% Was the Master Agreement Provision Likely to Substantially Lessen Competition in the Retail Pay Television Market? 
13%%per%%9%%per%%2%%per%%1 THE QUESTION 
2284 As I have noted%%lst%% it is common ground that s 45(2)(a)(ii) of the TP Act is prospective in operation%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The question that must be addressed%%lst%% %%cmp_tf%%%%lst%% is whether the Master Agreement Provision%%lst%% as at 13 December 2000%%lst%% was likely%%lst%% in the relevant sense%%lst%% to have the effect of substantially lessening competition in the retail pay television market%%per%% 
2285 On the construction of s 45(2)(b)(ii) of the TP Act that I prefer%%lst%% the question that must be addressed is whether%%lst%% at the date ]v[ dates any of the Consortium Respondents gave effect to the Master Agreement Provision%%lst%% it was likely%%lst%% in the relevant sense%%lst%% to have the effect of substantially lessening competition in the retail pay television market%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Seven would also be able to succeed in its case under s 45(2)(b)(ii) %%cmp_if%%%%lst%% at the material time ]v[ times%%lst%% the Master Agreement Provision already had the effect of substantially lessening competition in that market%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Since Seven does ]n[ advance any such contention%%lst%% it is only the first question that must be addressed in relation to s 45(2)(b)(ii)%%per%% 
2286 Seven%%sqt%%s submissions in relation to s 45(2)(b)(ii)%%lst%% concerning the effect of the Master Agreement Provision on competition in the retail pay television market%%lst%% do ]n[ specifically identify the conduct which is said to constitute giving effect to the provision%%per%%]$~ 
~$[However%%lst%% the pleadings suggest that the relevant conduct was entering into the various agreements implementing the arrangements embodied in the Master Agreement%%per%%]$~ 
~$[These agreements include the Foxtel Put ]^[ the News%%dsh%%Foxtel Licence%%per%%]$~ 
~$[I am prepared to assume that the parties entering these agreements gave effect to the Master Agreement Provision%%lst%% in the sense that they did an act in pursuance of ]v[ in accordance with the Master Agreement Provision%%cln%% TP Act %%lst%% s 4(1) (definition of %%sqt%% give effect to %%sqt%%)%%per%%]$~ 
~$[For present purposes%%lst%% the execution of the News%%dsh%%Foxtel Licence on 25 January 2001 can be taken as representative of conduct giving effect to the Master Agreement Provision%%per%%

~$[There is %%cmp_tf%% no need to consider whether the acquisition of those rights was likely as at that date%%lst%% although I have found in any event that the acquisition of the rights was likely once the Master Agreement was entered into on 13 December 2000%%per%%]$~ 
~$[So far as the News%%dsh%%Foxtel Licence is concerned%%lst%% the question is %%cmp_t%% whether the Master Agreement Provision was likely%%lst%% as at 25 January 2001%%lst%% to have the effect of substantially lessening competition in the retail pay television market%%per%%

~$[Determining whether the Master Agreement Provision%%lst%% ]v[ whether giving effect to the Master Agreement Provision%%lst%% was likely to have the effect of substantially lessening competition in that market requires a comparison to be made between the likely state of competition in the market with ]^[ without the impugned conduct%%per%%]$~

~$[Fox Sports%%lst%% in which News ]^[ PBL were partners%%lst%% had negotiated with Optus in 1998 ]f[ the supply of the Fox Sports channels%%per%%]$~ 
~$[A content supply agreement offered the opportunity ]f[ Fox Sports to place its channels on Optus%%lst%% since Telstra%%sqt%%s opposition to the supply of Fox Sports to Optus could be overcome by concessions to Telstra on other issues%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Once agreement could be reached on the matters of concern to Telstra%%lst%% its objections to a long%%dsh%%term deal between Foxtel ]^[ Fox Sports could be overcome%%per%% 
2299 The imperatives that gave rise to the resolution of the disputes among the Foxtel partners ]^[ to the conclusion of a content supply agreement would have been present even %%cmp_if%% News had ]n[ acquired the AFL broadcasting rights in December 2000 ]^[ Foxtel had ]n[ acquired the AFL pay television rights%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The explanations given by Mr Lee ]^[ Mr Anderson of the problems faced by CMM do ]n[ suggest that the problems would have been ameliorated in any significant way had Seven retained the AFL pay television rights%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Nor does their evidence suggest that the solutions preferred by Optus would have been any different%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Similarly%%lst%% it is difficult to see why the nature of the disputes dividing the Foxtel partners ]^[ the pressures ]f[ resolving those disputes would have been any different had Seven%%lst%% instead of News%%lst%% acquired the AFL pay television rights%%per%% 
2300 I have explained in Chapters 6 ]^[ 11 my reasons ]f[ accepting the evidence of Messrs Lee ]^[ Anderson%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Of course%%lst%% in late December 2000 ]v[ early 2001%%lst%% SingTel had ]n[ ]y[ taken over Optus ]^[ Mr Lee was ]n[ ]y[ involved in Optus%%sqt%% affairs%%per%% 
2301 In determining what was likely to occur in late 2000 ]v[ early 2001%%lst%% on the assumption that Seven secured the AFL pay television rights%%lst%% it is appropriate to take into account ]n[ only the circumstances facing Optus at the time ]b[ subsequent events%%per%%]$~ 
~$[No doubt these were influenced to some extent by the fact that SingTel effectively took over Optus in about June 2001%%per%%]$~ 
~$[But the decisions SingTel ]^[ the management of Optus faced would have had to be addressed by Optus even had SingTel had ]n[ become involved%%per%%]$~ 
~$[There is no reason to think that the deliberations would have produced different outcomes had SingTel (and Mr Lee in particular) ]n[ participated%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The views of Mr Lee ]^[ Mr Anderson (the latter of whom remained with Optus throughout the period when CMM%%sqt%%s role was reassessed) were ]n[ substantially different%%per%% 
2302 In my view%%lst%% of the two alternatives I have identified%%lst%% the second was much more likely%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The considerations that ultimately prompted Optus to opt ]f[ Project Alchemy over Manage ]f[ Cash would have been present even %%cmp_if%% Seven had acquired the AFL pay television rights%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Optus wanted%%lst%% among other things%%lst%% assistance in meeting its MSGs%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Furthermore%%lst%% had Optus had been unable to terminate the C7%%dsh%%Optus CSA (%%cmp_b%% Seven retained the AFL pay television rights) the desirability of a content supply agreement on terms similar to those in fact negotiated would have been even more apparent to Optus%%per%% 
2303 Seven argues against this conclusion on the ground that the decision by Optus to enter the Foxtel%%dsh%%Optus CSA was made in an %%sqt%% as is %%sqt%% world%%lst%% in which C7 could no longer offer Optus an independent subscription driving wholesale sports channel%%per%%]$~ 
~$[But this argument overlooks the fact that the problems faced by Optus%%sqt%% CMM were of long standing ]^[ had become more acute over the years%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The cash haemorrhage from CMM%%sqt%%s pay television operations took place during the period when Optus had access to C7%%sqt%%s %%sqt%% subscription driving content %%sqt%%%%per%% 
2304 Seven also draws a distinction between Optus sharing content with other pay television platforms (that is%%lst%% on a non%%dsh%%exclusive basis as was proposed in 1998) ]^[ being reduced to a mere reseller of Foxtel programming (effectively the position under the Foxtel%%dsh%%Optus CSA)%%per%%]$~ 
~$[By early 2001%%lst%% Optus%%sqt%% CMM had experienced years of heavy losses ]^[ Optus needed help to offset the burden of the MSGs payable under long%%dsh%%term content supply agreements%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In August 2001%%lst%% McKinsey identified Optus%%sqt%% fundamental problems as including a relatively weak pay television position ]^[ a difficult industry structure (too many players ]^[ excessive costs)%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Optus%%sqt%% position in 2001 was %%cmp_tf%% very different %%cmp_ta%% it was in 1998 ]^[ would have been just as different even %%cmp_if%% Seven had retained the AFL pay television rights%%per%% 
2305 One of the options advanced by McKinsey was %%sqt%% play to win %%sqt%%%%lst%% ]b[ this proposal centred on Optus being able to acquire Austar%%per%%]$~ 
~$[By early 2001%%lst%% Optus seems to have given no consideration to acquiring Austar as a possible solution to the problems facing CMM%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The idea was apparently first mooted within Optus as part of the CMM review in mid%%dsh%%2001%%lst%% although speculation about a possible merger was published in the financial press in June 2001%%per%% 
2306 An observer looking ahead in%%lst%% say%%lst%% January 2001 perhaps might have formed the view that there was a real chance that Optus would consider taking over ]v[ merging with Austar%%lst%% even though the idea had ]n[ ]y[ surfaced%%per%%]$~ 
~$[But such an observer%%lst%% in my opinion%%lst%% would ]n[ have concluded that there was a real chance that Optus would actually decide to pursue that option%%per%%]$~ 
~$[As Mr Lee explained%%lst%% once the take%%dsh%%over proposal was analysed%%lst%% it became apparent that Project Emu (as the proposal became known) presented too many problems to be implemented%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Those problems led Mr Lee to conclude in February 2002 that%%lst%% although the board had asked ]f[ the proposal to remain on Optus%%sqt%% agenda as a possibility%%lst%% it was unlikely to be acceptable as a commercially sound strategy ]f[ Optus to follow ]^[ was clearly inferior to the Manage ]f[ Cash option%%per%%]$~ 
~$[There is nothing to suggest that %%cmp_if%% Seven had retained the AFL pay television rights%%lst%% a merger of Optus ]^[ Austar would have been a more likely option%%per%% 
2307 Seven also submits that it was %%sqt%% highly unlikely %%sqt%% that Foxtel would have agreed to assume Optus%%sqt%% MSG obligations under the C7%%dsh%%Optus CSA%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The evidentiary basis ]f[ this submission is unclear%%lst%% particularly given the extent of the MSGs in fact assumed by Foxtel under the C7%%dsh%%Optus CSA%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In any event%%lst%% the submission pays no regard to the fact that cl 9%%per%%3 of the C7%%dsh%%Optus CSA allowed Seven to license the C7 channel to Optus%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In that event%%lst%% the fees payable by Optus were to be reduced by $2 million per annum%%lst%% plus 25 per cent of the licence fees paid by Foxtel%%per%% 
2308 Had Seven retained the AFL pay television rights%%lst%% there is every reason to think that Foxtel would have taken AFL content via C7%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Much evidence points in this direction%%per%%]$~ 
~$[After all%%lst%% the whole point of the arrangements between the Foxtel Partnership%%lst%% Optus ]^[ the individual Foxtel partners was to share content%%per%%]$~ 
~$[If Seven had indeed retained the AFL pay television rights%%lst%% the strong likelihood is that %%sqt%% industry rationalisation %%sqt%% could have been achieved in a way that accommodated the minimum payment obligations imposed on Optus by the C7%%dsh%%Optus CSA%%per%% 
2309 In my view%%lst%% looking at the circumstances prevailing on 13 December 2000 ]v[ 25 January 2001%%lst%% the very strong likelihood was that%%lst%% in the absence of the conduct alleged to have contravened s 45(2)(b)(ii) of the TP Act %%lst%% the major pay television retailers would have entered into an agreement on terms similar to those incorporated in the Foxtel%%dsh%%Optus CSA%%per%%]$~ 
~$[That being the case%%lst%% the allegedly contravening conduct was ]n[ likely to have had the effect of substantially lessening competition in the retail pay television market%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The weak competition provided by Optus to Foxtel in the retail pay television market would have become even weaker%%per%% 
2310 The other%%lst%% much less likely%%lst%% alternative was that Optus would have adopted something like the Manage ]f[ Cash strategy%%lst%% as a means of winding down the pay television business in a reasonably orderly fashion%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Had such a strategy been adopted%%lst%% the very strong likelihood is that Optus would have left the pay television business within a period of three to four years%%per%%]$~ 
~$[During that period Optus would have wound down its pay television activities and%%lst%% in particular%%lst%% would ]n[ have sought to attract new subscribers ]v[ to replace those it lost through churn%%per%%]$~ 
~$[As Mr Lee and%%lst%% more particularly%%lst%% Mr Anderson explained%%lst%% a plan that sought to pare back costs ]^[ ]n[ actively to seek subscribers was in substance an exit strategy%%lst%% albeit one to be implemented over a period of time%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The principal object of any such strategy would have been to cushion the financial impact of Optus%%sqt%% MSGs%%lst%% rather %%cmp_ta%% to keep the business going%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Despite the guarded optimism by McKinsey that CMM might have survived (an optimism ]n[ shared by Optus%%sqt%% management)%%lst%% had an approach similar to Manage ]f[ Cash been adopted%%lst%% it would have resulted in Optus ceasing to be a retail supplier of pay television within a relatively short time%%per%% 
2311 The %%sqt%% counter%%dsh%%factual %%sqt%% requires an assumption to be made that Seven acquired the AFL pay television rights in respect of 2002 to 2006%%per%%]$~ 
~$[On that assumption%%lst%% even %%cmp_if%% it is accepted that there was a real chance on 13 December 2000 ]v[ 25 January 2001 that Optus would have selected a Manage ]f[ Cash strategy (or something very like it)%%lst%% there would have been no real chance that competition in the retail pay television market would have been substantially lessened%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Under the Manage ]f[ Cash strategy%%lst%% the strong likelihood is that Optus would have left the retail pay television market within a few years%%lst%% following a winding down process%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Consequently%%lst%% Optus would have been removed as any kind of constraint%%lst%% weak ]v[ otherwise%%lst%% on the Foxtel Partnership in the retail pay television market%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Accordingly%%lst%% %%cmp_if%% the allegedly contravening conduct had ]n[ occurred%%lst%% ]^[ %%cmp_if%% Seven had acquired the AFL pay television rights%%lst%% competition in the retail pay television market would ]n[ have been any more robust %%cmp_ta%% in the events which did occur%%per%% 
2314 The findings I have made as to the likely effect of the Master Agreement Provision on competition in the retail pay television market apply equally to the provisions in the other contracts relied on by Seven ]^[ to the Master Agreement Provision on all relevant dates after 13 December 2000%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The contracts implementing the Master Agreement were entered into December 2000 ]^[ January 2001%%per%%]$~ 
~$[As I have noted%%lst%% Seven does ]n[ suggest that there is any reason to differentiate between the contracts entered into during this brief period%%lst%% ]s[ far as their effects on competition in the retail pay television market are concerned%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In any event%%lst%% I see no basis in the evidence ]f[ making different findings as to the effect on competition of provisions in those contracts ]v[ of the Master Agreement Provision itself at different times in December 2000 ]^[ January 2001%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The circumstances I have identified were present throughout that period%%per%% 
2315 For the reasons in this Chapter%%lst%% I reject Seven%%sqt%%s effects case under s 45(2) of the TP Act %%per%% 
2316 I add%%lst%% ]f[ the sake of completeness%%lst%% that in Chapter 15 I reject Seven%%sqt%%s contention that Foxtel%%lst%% through News%%lst%% overbid ]f[ the AFL pay television rights%%per%%]$~ 
~$[I also reject Seven%%sqt%%s claims that Foxtel took advantage of its market power by refusing to negotiate with C7 ]f[ the carriage of its channels ]^[ by making statements to the AFL to the effect that Foxtel would ]n[ take C7%%sqt%%s channels even %%cmp_if%% C7 acquired the AFL pay television rights%%per%%]$~ 
~$[These findings may be significant in relation to Seven%%sqt%%s argument that the Consortium Respondents employed anti%%dsh%%competitive means to obtain the AFL pay television rights%%per%%]$~

2317 This Chapter is primarily concerned with Seven%%sqt%%s purpose case against News%%lst%% Foxtel (Sky Cable ]^[ Telstra Media)%%lst%% PBL ]^[ Telstra (that is%%lst%% the Consortium Respondents)%%lst%% insofar as it is founded in s 45(2) of the TP Act %%per%%]$~ 
~$[Seven contends that the Consortium Respondents made contracts ]v[ arrangements%%lst%% ]v[ arrived at understandings%%lst%% containing various provisions which had the purpose of substantially lessening competition%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Seven also alleges that the Consortium Respondents gave effect to the various provisions%%per%% 
2318 The Chapter addresses two issues of construction that are important to Seven%%sqt%%s case%%per%%]$~ 
~$[One issue is whether%%lst%% in order ]f[ a contravention of s 45(2) to be made out by reason of an anti%%dsh%%competitive purpose%%lst%% all the parties responsible ]f[ including a provision in a contract (including an arrangement ]v[ understanding) must share that purpose%%per%%]$~ 
~$[If so%%lst%% Seven%%sqt%%s case based on a particular provision (such as the Master Agreement Provision) will fail unless all the parties responsible ]f[ its inclusion in the contract have the purpose of substantially lessening competition%%per%% 
2319 The second issue of construction is whether s 45(2) can be contravened where the alleged anti%%dsh%%competitive purpose%%lst%% even %%cmp_if%% achieved%%lst%% could ]n[ have the effect of substantially lessening competition in a market%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Seven argues that an alleged contravenor can have the proscribed purpose notwithstanding that it is in fact impossible ]f[ the alleged contravenor to achieve the purpose%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In particular%%lst%% Seven contends that a party can contravene s 45(2) by having the purpose of substantially lessening competition in a market which it believes exists%%lst%% even %%cmp_if%% the market does ]n[ in fact exist%%per%% 
2320 The second issue of construction leads to a related question%%cln%% where a party seeks to achieve a particular objective (such as killing C7)%%lst%% ]b[ that objective%%lst%% even %%cmp_if%% achieved%%lst%% cannot have the effect of substantially lessening competition in a market%%lst%% does the party have the purpose of substantially lessening competition? 
2321 I commence the Chapter with an explanation of why findings as to the purpose ]v[ purposes of the Consortium Respondents are significant to the issues in the proceedings%%per%%]$~ 
~$[I %%cmp_t%% outline Seven%%sqt%%s pleaded purpose case under s 45(2) of the TP Act ]^[ address the issues of construction I have identified%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Since I conclude that a contravention of s 45(2) of the TP Act by reason of an anti%%dsh%%competitive purpose cannot be made out unless all parties responsible ]f[ including the provision in the contract shared that purpose%%lst%% I consider whether Seven can show that to be the case in relation to each of the provisions upon which it relies%%per%%]$~ 
~$[That analysis requires findings to be made as to Telstra%%sqt%%s purpose%%per%%]$~ 
~$[I also consider whether%%lst%% on the findings I have made%%lst%% the purpose alleged against the Consortium Respondents is one that can be said to involve substantially lessening competition%%per%% 
2322 As will appear%%lst%% it is ]n[ strictly necessary ]f[ me%%lst%% in addressing Seven%%sqt%%s purpose case under s 45(2) of the TP Act %%lst%% to make findings as to whether the Consortium Respondents%%lst%% other %%cmp_ta%% Telstra%%lst%% had the purpose of substantially lessening competition%%per%%]$~

~$[It is necessary to go %%cmp_e%%where in Seven%%sqt%%s submissions to ascertain why the proposed findings as to the purpose of the Consortium Respondents are significant%%per%% 
14%%per%%2%%per%%1 Purpose of Substantially Lessening Competition 
2324 The first reason why the purpose of the Consortium Respondents is material is that Seven seeks to make out a purpose case against them under s 45(2) of the TP Act %%per%% 
2325 The purpose Seven alleges in its case under s 45(2) of the TP Act is that the Consortium Respondents intended that Foxtel should acquire the AFL pay television rights ]^[ that C7 should be prevented from acquiring the NRL pay television rights%%per%% 
14%%per%%2%%per%%2 Foxtel%%sqt%%s Taking Advantage of Market Power ]f[ an Anti%%dsh%%Competitive Purpose 
2326 Secondly%%lst%% purpose is material to Seven%%sqt%%s case against News%%lst%% Foxtel ]^[ PBL under s 46(1) of the TP Act %%per%% 
2327 It follows%%lst%% according to Seven%%lst%% that Foxtel contravened s 46(1) of the TP Act %%cmp_b%% it took advantage of its substantial power in the various markets ]f[ the purpose of preventing the entry of C7 into the relevant markets ]v[ deterring ]v[ preventing C7 from engaging in competitive conduct in the markets%%per%%]$~ 
~$[This part of Seven%%sqt%%s case is addressed in Chapter 16%%per%% 
14%%per%%2%%per%%3 Seven%%sqt%%s Claim under s 45D 
2328 Thirdly%%lst%% purpose is material to Seven%%sqt%%s case under s 45D of the TP Act %%per%%]$~ 
~$[Seven claims that the Consortium Respondents%%lst%% together with Nine ]^[ Fox Sports%%lst%% engaged in conduct in concert that %%sqt%% hindered %%sqt%% ]v[ %%sqt%% prevented %%sqt%% Foxtel%%lst%% Optus ]v[ Austar acquiring goods ]v[ services from C7 ]f[ the purpose of destroying ]v[ at least causing significant harm to the business of C7%%per%%]$~ 
~$[This part of Seven%%sqt%%s case is addressed in Chapter 21%%per%% 
14%%per%%3 Seven%%sqt%%s Pleaded Purpose Case under s 45(2) 
2329 Seven%%sqt%%s pleaded purpose case alleges that 11 provisions ]v[ sets of provisions were included in contracts ]f[ a proscribed purpose%%per%% 
2330 I limit the summary of the pleadings to these provisions%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The pleadings refer to the various markets on which Seven relies to make out its case%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It is necessary to bear in mind that I have rejected three of the four markets on which Seven relies to make out its case%%lst%% namely the wholesale sports channel market%%lst%% the AFL pay rights market ]^[ the NRL pay rights market%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It is also necessary to bear in mind that the Statement of Claim defines %%sqt%% Foxtel %%sqt%% to mean the business carried on in partnership by Sky Cable ]^[ Telstra Media (par 8)%%per%% 
2332 This pleading is supported by an allegation that from early 1999 until December 2000%%lst%% Foxtel was concerned about the potential ]f[ C7 to compete with Foxtel by digital multicasting over Seven%%sqt%%s free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air broadcasting infrastructure ]v[ by supplying retail pay television services over the Telstra Cable (par 198(a))%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In particular%%lst%% C7 was threatening Foxtel%%sqt%%s monopoly in relation to the Telstra Cable ]^[ was threatening to compete with it over the same infrastructure (par 198(b))%%per%% 
2333 A substantial purpose of Foxtel entering into the Master Agreement incorporating the Master Agreement Provision was %%sqt%% to kill C7 %%sqt%% (par 198(c))%%per%%]$~ 
~$[News ]^[ PBL were %%sqt%% privy to [Foxtel%%sqt%%s] purpose %%sqt%%%%lst%% while Telstra was %%sqt%% aware %%sqt%% of Foxtel%%sqt%%s purpose (par 198(d)%%lst%% (f))%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Telstra was also aware that the likely effect of Foxtel obtaining the AFL pay television rights was that C7 would cease to operate (par 198(g))%%per%% 
2334 The terms of the AFL Proposal%%lst%% reflected in the Foxtel Put%%lst%% were such that to the knowledge of News%%lst%% Foxtel%%lst%% PBL ]^[ Telstra%%lst%% Foxtel was unlikely to make a profit from the acquisition of the AFL pay television rights except by curtailing competition in the retail pay television market (par 198(i))%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Telstra%%sqt%%s own assessment was that the acquisition of the AFL pay television rights was %%sqt%% value dilutive %%sqt%% ]f[ Foxtel ]^[ would be likely to result in a significant loss ]f[ Foxtel over the five year term of the rights proposal (par 198(j))%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Telstra thus endorsed an acquisition of the AFL pay television rights which its management had concluded was financially unjustified%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Foxtel%%sqt%%s assessment was to the same effect as that of Telstra (par 198(k))%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Further%%lst%% a substantial purpose of News ]^[ PBL%%lst%% as the ultimate shareholders of Foxtel ]^[ Fox Sports%%lst%% was to remove ]v[ substantially lessen C7%%sqt%%s ability to compete against Foxtel ]^[ Fox Sports (par 198(q))%%per%% 
2335 Alternatively%%lst%% a substantial purpose of the Master Agreement Provision was to enable Foxtel to secure the AFL pay television rights (and to prevent C7 from acquiring the NRL pay television rights) ]s[ as to reduce the competitive strength of Optus in the retail pay television market (par 199)%%per%% 
2336 By reason of the matters pleaded in the Statement of Claim%%lst%% a substantial purpose of the Master Agreement Provision was to substantially lessen competition in the retail pay television market (par 201)%%per%%

14%%per%%4%%per%%1 News%%lst%% PBL ]^[ Foxtel 
2345 Seven%%sqt%%s case%%lst%% as explained in its Reply Submissions%%lst%% is ]n[ merely that the object ]v[ purpose of News%%lst%% Foxtel ]^[ PBL was to eliminate C7 as an ongoing business%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Rather%%lst%% Seven%%sqt%%s case is that News%%lst%% Foxtel ]^[ PBL had the purpose of eliminating ]v[ damaging C7 %%sqt%% ]s[ as to cause a substantial lessening of competition by making Fox Sports dominant %%sqt%% (emphasis in original)%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Seven puts its contention in this way in order to avoid the riposte that it is of the essence of competition that a firm will attempt to harm its competitors%%per%%]$~ 
~$[According to Seven%%lst%% the purpose of News%%lst%% Foxtel ]^[ PBL %%sqt%% was ]n[ merely to strike at a competitor%%lst%% ]b[ was to strike at competition %%sqt%%%%per%% 
2346 Seven says that from the first half of 1998%%lst%% News formulated a strategy to make Fox Sports the exclusive supplier of Australian sports programming to all other pay television platforms%%per%%]$~ 
~$[This strategy involved promoting the interests of Fox Sports%%lst%% in which News initially had a 100 per cent (later 50 per cent) interest%%lst%% over the interests of Foxtel%%lst%% in which News initially had a 50 per cent (later 25 per cent) interest%%per%%]$~ 
~$[News%%sqt%% strategy was%%lst%% however%%lst%% frustrated by the creation of C7 ]^[ its success in June 1998 in entering into a ten year supply agreement with Optus (the C7%%dsh%%Optus CSA)%%per%% 
2347 News saw C7 as the only significant competitor to Fox Sports in the supply of premium sports channels ]^[ in the acquisition of sports rights%%per%%]$~ 
~$[News fully appreciated the benefit to Fox Sports %%cmp_if%% competition from C7 was removed%%per%%]$~ 
~$[This perception%%lst%% according to Seven%%lst%% was shared by PBL once it acquired its interest in Fox Sports%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Foxtel%%lst%% whose CEO was appointed by News%%lst%% aligned itself with News ]^[ PBL in relation to issues concerning C7%%per%%]$~ 
~$[News%%lst%% PBL ]^[ Foxtel also saw C7 as a potential competitor in the retail pay television market%%per%% 
2348 Seven says that News ]^[ PBL took every opportunity to stifle C7 as a competitor%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Their actions included vetoing any carriage of the C7 channels by Foxtel ]^[ participating in the arrangements leading to the acquisition of the AFL pay television rights by Foxtel%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The availability of the AFL broadcasting rights in 2000 gave News ]^[ PBL the opportunity to bring about the termination of the C7%%dsh%%Optus CSA (by creating the circumstances in which Optus could exercise its right of termination) and%%lst%% in effect%%lst%% to remove C7 as a competitor to Fox Sports%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It was ]f[ this reason that News ]^[ PBL supported Foxtel%%sqt%%s acquisition of the AFL pay television rights%%lst%% even though they well understood that this was a much more expensive option %%cmp_ta%% acquiring more ]v[ less equivalent rights by agreement with C7%%per%% 
2349 In the lead%%dsh%%up to the acquisition of the AFL pay television rights%%lst%% News ]^[ PBL maintained their opposition to Foxtel taking the C7 channels%%per%%]$~ 
~$[They did ]s[ %%cmp_b%% otherwise Foxtel would have been able to negotiate down the price of the Fox Sports channels ]^[ C7 may have become entrenched as a strong competitor to Fox Sports%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Seven points to evidence suggesting that modelling conducted by Foxtel in 1999 showed that the carriage of the C7 channels would have been profitable ]f[ Foxtel%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Indeed%%lst%% Seven argues that in 1999%%lst%% executives within Foxtel thought that a deal with C7 could be consummated on terms satisfactory to Foxtel%%lst%% at a price slightly less %%cmp_ta%% C7 had already offered%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Ultimately%%lst%% however%%lst%% Foxtel (principally through Mr Mockridge) harmonised its interests with those of News ]^[ made concessions to Fox Sports at Foxtel%%sqt%%s own expense%%per%% 
2350 Seven also places considerable reliance on a number of internal Telstra memoranda%%per%%]$~ 
~$[These suggest%%lst%% ]s[ Seven argues%%lst%% that the Telstra representatives on the Foxtel Management board held the view that News ]^[ PBL wanted C7 to fail ]^[ that it was this that prompted Foxtel%%sqt%%s refusal to take the C7 channels%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Seven says that the perception of the Telstra representatives was that by forcing Foxtel to take sporting content from Fox Sports at inflated prices%%lst%% profits were effectively being diverted from Foxtel to Fox Sports ]^[ that News ]^[ PBL intended to %%sqt%% kill C7 %%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[According to Seven%%lst%% Telstra%%sqt%%s perception was completely accurate%%per%% 
2351 Seven recognises that there is evidence suggesting that one reason why News ]^[ PBL opposed Foxtel carrying C7 was that they wanted to resolve a long%%dsh%%term supply arrangement between Foxtel ]^[ Fox Sports%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Seven submits that%%lst%% even %%cmp_if%% this was a reason ]f[ their opposition%%lst%% their actions were consistent with a desire to prevent competition between Fox Sports ]^[ C7%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Specifically%%lst%% News ]^[ PBL prevented Foxtel from carrying C7 ]s[ as to ensure that Fox Sports had an advantage in its commercial negotiations with Foxtel%%per%% 
2352 Seven also recognises that News%%sqt%% witnesses gave evidence that one reason ]f[ being opposed to Foxtel taking C7 was that%%lst%% by late 1999%%lst%% a view had been formed that to do ]s[ would interfere with Foxtel%%sqt%%s ]v[ News%%sqt%% negotiations ]f[ the AFL pay television rights%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Seven submits that Foxtel%%sqt%%s decision to acquire the AFL pay television rights from the AFL (through News) was inexplicable except as conduct designed to hinder C7 from competing with Fox Sports%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The direct acquisition of the rights was understood by the Foxtel partners to be an inferior option and%%lst%% in any event%%lst%% was never the subject of a careful comparison with the option of taking sports content from C7%%per%% 
2353 Seven argues that%%lst%% even on Foxtel%%sqt%%s own analyses%%lst%% the direct acquisition of the AFL pay television rights was less profitable %%cmp_ta%% the acquisition of AFL pay television rights through C7%%lst%% as had been discussed in 1999%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In any event%%lst%% even %%cmp_if%% News ]^[ PBL were motivated by the desire to preserve the option of direct acquisition of the AFL pay television rights%%lst%% they engaged in %%sqt%% exclusionary conduct %%sqt%% which contravened the TP Act %%per%% 
2354 Seven rejects the contention advanced by the Respondents that the quality of the C7 channels provided a genuine reason ]f[ Foxtel to decline to take them%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In truth%%lst%% Seven contends%%lst%% the refusal to take the C7 channels was a refusal in principle%%lst%% unaffected by any issue as to quality ]v[ the terms on which the C7 channels could be obtained%%per%% 
2355 In summary%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%Where News ]^[ PBL had a motive to damage C7%%lst%% had a plan to make Fox Sports dominant%%lst%% took steps to prevent C7 competing with Fox Sports ]f[ carriage on Foxtel%%lst%% ]^[ knew that the likely impact of acquiring AFL rights would be to damage C7 %%per%%%%per%%%%per%% it may be inferred that News ]^[ PBL intended the likely consequences of their actions%%sqt%%%%per%% 
2358 Seven relies particularly on conversations between Mr Blomfield of Foxtel Management ]^[ Telstra executives%%lst%% as recorded in the answers to interrogatories supplied by Telstra to which I have referred in Chapter 8%%per%%]$~ 
~$[According to this material%%lst%% Mr Blomfield (who did ]n[ give evidence) said that the acquisition of the AFL pay television rights by Foxtel was %%sqt%% about killing C7 %%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Seven also relies on Dr Switkowski%%sqt%%s acknowledgement in his evidence that Telstra executives had expressed the view to him that News%%sqt%% refusal to countenance C7 on Foxtel was contrary to Foxtel%%sqt%%s interests ]^[ favoured Fox Sports on pricing%%per%% 
2359 In addition%%lst%% Seven draws attention to contemporaneous internal Telstra documents complaining about the lack of concern displayed by News ]^[ PBL ]f[ Foxtel%%sqt%%s best interests ]^[ suggesting that both wanted C7 to fail%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It also relies on internal Telstra documentation which recorded concerns about the reliability of the assumptions underlying financial models prepared within Foxtel relating to the proposal ]f[ the acquisition of the AFL pay television rights%%per%% 
2360 Seven invites me to make a finding that Telstra appreciated that%%lst%% %%cmp_if%% C7 failed to acquire the AFL pay television rights%%lst%% it would cease to have a viable business ]^[ Fox Sports would become a monopoly supplier of popular Australian sports content%%per%%]$~ 
~$[To the extent that Dr Switkowski ]^[ Mr Akhurst gave evidence to the contrary%%lst%% Seven asks me ]n[ to accept that evidence%%per%% 
2361 Seven contends that Telstra had a motive ]f[ joining in the purpose of News ]^[ PBL to destroy C7 ]^[ create a monopoly ]f[ Fox Sports%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The principal motive lay in Telstra%%sqt%%s view that significant additional value could be unlocked from the Foxtel business %%cmp_if%% the scope of the business were to be expanded%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Seven identifies%%lst%% ]f[ example%%lst%% a presentation to senior executives of Telstra by Mr Akhurst in April 2000%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In that presentation%%lst%% Mr Akhurst suggested that an expanded Foxtel business could be worth as much as $4%%per%%9 billion%%lst%% %%cmp%%d with a value on a stand alone basis of between $1%%per%%3 ]^[ $2%%per%%2 billion dollars%%per%%]$~ 
~$[An important component of the plan to add value to Foxtel%%lst%% from Telstra%%sqt%%s point of view%%lst%% was the role played by Foxtel in Telstra%%sqt%%s telephony defence %%dsh%%%%dsh%%%%dsh%% that is%%lst%% assisting Telstra to offer a full range of services%%lst%% including pay television%%lst%% to prevent the loss of revenue to its telephony competitors%%per%% 
2362 The difficulty from Telstra%%sqt%%s perspective was that an expansion of Foxtel%%sqt%%s business required the cooperation of News ]^[ PBL%%per%%]$~ 
~$[According to Seven%%lst%% Telstra regarded support ]f[ the acquisition of the AFL pay television rights by Foxtel as a way of building trust within the Foxtel Partnership%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Greater trust would assist Telstra to make progress on other issues%%lst%% including Telstra%%sqt%%s desire to offer bundled products ]^[ to expand Foxtel%%sqt%%s business%%per%% 
2363 Seven gives two answers to the Respondents%%sqt%% argument that Dr Switkowski ]^[ Mr Akhurst were the decision%%dsh%%makers within Telstra ]^[ that they disclaimed knowledge of any plan by News ]^[ PBL to destroy C7 ]v[ create a monopoly ]f[ Fox Sports as a supplier of Australian sporting content%%per%%]$~ 
~$[One answer is to invite me to reject the evidence of Dr Switkowski ]^[ Mr Akhurst%%per%%]$~ 
~$[A second answer is that the knowledge ]v[ state of mind of Mr Greg Willis%%lst%% the head of Telstra%%sqt%%s Media division%%lst%% should be attributed to Telstra%%lst%% even %%cmp_if%% I find that Dr Switkowski ]^[ Mr Akhurst did ]n[ share his views ]v[ understanding%%per%%]$~

14%%per%%5%%per%%2 Purpose in Relation to Markets 
2369 Seven%%sqt%%s submissions distinguish the purpose of the various Consortium Respondents by reference to the various pleaded markets%%per%% 
14%%per%%5%%per%%2%%per%%1 WHOLESALE SPORTS CHANNEL MARKET 
2370 Seven takes as the starting point that the purpose of News (and later of PBL) was to eliminate competition from C7 ]^[ thus substantially increase the value of Fox Sports as a supplier of wholesale sports channels%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The ultimate object was to ensure that Fox Sports became the dominant supplier of Australian sports programming to all pay television platforms ]^[ that competition ]f[ rights (and thus rights fees) would be reduced%%per%% 
2371 Whether they appreciated it ]v[ not%%lst%% News ]^[ PBL acted on the basis that there was a separate wholesale sports channel market in which C7 was the only significant competitor to Fox Sports%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Their actions were only consistent with an understanding that%%lst%% in the absence of C7%%lst%% Fox Sports would ]n[ be constrained to any significant extent by close competitors%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The understanding of News ]^[ PBL is %%cmp_tf%% powerful evidence of the existence of a wholesale sports channel market%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It follows that%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%a substantial purpose of News ]^[ PBL in participating in the acquisition of AFL pay rights ]^[ supporting Foxtel%%sqt%%s acquisition of those rights [was] to achieve a significant reduction of competition to Fox Sports in the wholesale sports channel market%%per%% 
%%per%%%%per%%%%per%% 
[T]he objective which News ]^[ PBL sought to achieve%%lst%% the end in view%%lst%% was the substantial reduction of competition to Fox Sports in the wholesale sports channel market%%sqt%%%%per%% 
2372 As I have noted%%lst%% Seven submits that it does ]n[ matter%%lst%% ]s[ far as its purpose case is concerned%%lst%% that there was in fact no lessening of competition in a given market ]v[ even that the market envisaged by the participants did ]n[ exist%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Similarly%%lst%% it is ]n[ to the point %%cmp_if%% it be the case that News ]^[ PBL did ]n[ think in terms of a wholesale sports channel market%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The consequence of eliminating C7%%lst%% ]v[ rendering it an ineffective competitor to Fox Sports%%lst%% was substantially to lessen competition in the wholesale sports channel market%%per%% 
2373 According to Seven%%lst%% Foxtel%%sqt%%s purpose was the same as that of News ]^[ PBL%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Foxtel was well aware of the %%sqt%% ambitions %%sqt%% of News ]^[ PBL ]f[ Fox Sports%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%Foxtel was content with the reduction of competition in the wholesale sports channel market %%cmp_b%% the removal of C7 conferred other advantages on Foxtel%%lst%% being that C7 was removed as a competitive threat in the retail pay television market%%lst%% C7 was prevented from depriving Foxtel of its exclusive access to infrastructure which was under threat by C7 in the access proceedings%%lst%% ]^[ the acquisition of AFL rights conferred a competitive advantage on Foxtel vis%%dsh%%%%dsh%%vis Optus%%sqt%%%%per%% 
2374 Telstra joined with the purpose of News%%lst%% Foxtel ]^[ PBL%%lst%% well knowing the consequences ]f[ C7 ]^[ ]f[ competition in the wholesale sports channel market%%per%% 
14%%per%%5%%per%%2%%per%%2 AFL PAY RIGHTS MARKET 
2375 News ]^[ (later) PBL understood that %%cmp_if%% Fox Sports could become the dominant supplier of sports channels to all pay television platforms it would obtain considerable benefits in reducing the costs of sports rights%%per%%]$~ 
~$[For example%%lst%% News%%sqt%% financial models assumed that in the absence of competition%%lst%% rights costs would inflate at three per cent per annum less %%cmp_ta%% %%cmp_if%% there were competition%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Similarly%%lst%% News understood that the frustration of its plan to sell Fox Sports non%%dsh%%exclusively to all platforms %%cmp_b%% of C7%%sqt%%s advent was likely to increase the fees paid ]f[ sports rights%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Thus%%lst%% a substantial purpose of News ]^[ PBL in eliminating C7 was the substantial lessening of competition ]f[ the acquisition of sports rights in the AFL pay rights market%%per%%]$~ 
~$[This conclusion is ]n[ affected by the fact that it was ultimately the Foxtel Partnership%%lst%% rather %%cmp_ta%% Fox Sports%%lst%% that bid ]f[ the AFL pay television rights%%lst%% since there was no prospect of competitive bidding between the Foxtel Partnership ]^[ Fox Sports ]f[ sports rights%%per%%

~$[The purpose of News ]^[ Foxtel in relation to the Rights Sub%%dsh%%Licence Provision was the same as their purpose in relation to the News%%dsh%%Foxtel Licence Provision%%per%%]$~

~$[ASX v Pont Data concerned agreements whereby ASX was to supply Pont with financial data in electronic form%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Each agreement contained restrictions on the use that Pont could make of the data%%lst%% in particular on resupply of the information%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Pont alleged%%lst%% among other things%%lst%% that the provisions had the purpose of substantially lessening competition in the wholesale financial information market%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The trial Judge%%lst%% Wilcox J%%lst%% found that Pont had signed the agreements only %%cmp_b%% otherwise it faced losing access to critical data%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Moreover%%lst%% Pont had unsuccessfully objected to inclusion of the provisions in the agreements%%per%% 
2394 The Full Court pointed out (27 FCR%%lst%% at 475) that s 46 of the TP Act strikes at the unilateral activity of a monopolist in taking advantage of its power ]f[ a particular purpose%%lst%% while s 45 operates upon contracts between two ]v[ more parties some of whom may ]n[ have the proscribed purpose%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Their Honours observed that where ]n[ all the parties have the necessary subjective purpose%%lst%% the question is how one determines whether the contract they make (or a provision of the contract) has a particular purpose%%per%% 
2395 The Court answered the question as follows (27 FCR%%lst%% at 476)%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%In its operation upon provisions stated to have a particular purpose%%lst%% s 4F uses the words %%dqt%%the provision was included in the contract %%per%%%%per%%%%per%% ]f[ that purpose ]v[ ]f[ purposes that included ]v[ include that purpose%%dqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[This indicates that s 4F%%lst%% in this operation%%lst%% requires one to look to the purposes of the individuals by whom the provision was included in the contract%%lst%% arrangement ]v[ understanding in question %%per%%]$~ 
~$[It %%cmp_tf%% directs attention to the %%dqt%%subjective%%dqt%% purposes of those individuals%%sqt%%%%per%% 
(Emphasis added%%per%% 
) 
After referring to Wilcox J%%sqt%%s findings%%lst%% the Court stated (27 FCR%%lst%% at 477) that%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%In considering complaints by Pont as to the alleged anti%%dsh%%competitive purpose%%lst%% it is %%cmp_tf%% appropriate to look to the purposes of the party as a result of whose efforts they were included %%lst%% that is to say [ASX]%%sqt%%%%per%% 
(Emphasis added%%per%% 
2397 Contrary to Seven%%sqt%%s submissions%%lst%% the reasoning in ASX v Pont Data is ]n[ binding on me%%lst%% since the Court ultimately held that the purpose case against ASX under s 45(2) of the TP Act failed (27 FCR%%lst%% at 487)%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Nonetheless%%lst%% the carefully considered views of the Full Court have persuasive force and%%lst%% in any event%%lst%% I think that the reasoning is sound%%per%%]$~ 
~$[However%%lst%% it will be seen that the reasoning in ASX v Pont Data does ]n[ address the approach to be taken in circumstances where two ]v[ more parties are responsible ]f[ the insertion of a provision in a contract%%lst%% ]b[ where ]n[ all of those parties share the subjective purpose of substantially lessening competition%%per%%]$~ 
~$[That is the point at which the submissions in the present case diverge%%per%% 
2398 There is authority supporting the proposition that%%lst%% in order to come within s 45(2) of the TP Act %%lst%% the relevant purpose must be common to all parties responsible ]f[ the inclusion of the provision in a contract%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In Carlton United Breweries (NSW) Pty Ltd v Bond Brewing New South Wales Ltd (1987) 16 FCR 351%%lst%% T Co granted B Co%%lst%% a brewer%%lst%% head leases of a large number of hotels%%lst%% thus interposing B Co between the owner ]^[ the individual licensees%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In proceedings ]f[ interlocutory relief%%lst%% Wilcox J held that the applicant%%lst%% another brewer%%lst%% had failed to establish that a provision of the agreement had the purpose of preventing ]v[ limiting the supply of goods to particular persons ]v[ classes of persons within s 4D(1)(b) of the TP Act %%per%%]$~ 
~$[Wilcox J said (at 356)%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%The purpose referred to in par (b) of the definition is a purpose common to the parties%%per%%]$~ 
~$[I have no doubt that it was a purpose of [B Co] to reduce the supply of beer by [the applicant] to operators of the hotels with which the agreement was concerned%%lst%% ]b[ there is no evidence to indicate that this was a purpose shared by [T Co]%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It was conceded in the Supreme Court by Mr Spalvins%%lst%% the chief executive of [T Co]%%lst%% that%%lst%% at the time of the agreement%%lst%% he was aware that [B Co] wished to acquire the leases in order to improve its market share%%scn%% ]b[ to say that a party is aware of the purpose of another party is a very different thing from saying that the former shared the latter%%sqt%%s purpose%%per%%]$~ 
~$[So far as the evidence indicates%%lst%% there is no reason to suppose that Mr Spalvins%%lst%% ]v[ [T Co]%%lst%% was actuated by any purpose other %%cmp_ta%% that of obtaining the best bargain which was commercially attainable%%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Although Wilcox J was concerned with s 4D of the TP Act %%lst%% the same reasoning would seem to apply to s 45(2)%%per%% 
2399 Wilcox J%%sqt%%s reasoning was followed by Young J in Stokely%%dsh%%Van Camp%%lst%% Inc v New Generation Beverages Pty Ltd (1998) 44 NSWLR 607%%lst%% at 617%%per%%]$~ 
~$[However%%lst%% Young J%%sqt%%s comments were obiter dicta and%%lst%% like Wilcox J%%lst%% his Honour did ]n[ find it necessary to examine the operation of s 4F of the TP Act %%per%%]$~ 
~$[See%%lst%% too%%lst%% Rural Press Ltd v Australian Competition ]^[ Consumer Commission [2002] FCAFC 213 %%scn%% (2002) 118 FCR 236%%lst%% at 266 [105]%%lst%% per curiam %%per%% 
2400 Seven does ]n[ suggest that its contention has been authoritatively upheld in Australia%%per%%]$~ 
~$[However%%lst%% it claims support from dicta of Gummow J in News v South Sydney %%per%%]$~ 
~$[His Honour said (215 CLR%%lst%% at 585%%dsh%%586 [59]%%dsh%%[62])%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%It will be noted that [the trial Judge] focused on the subjective reasons of the parties to the contract in which the relevant provision is contained%%per%%]$~ 
~$[At first glance%%lst%% such an approach might appear to conflict with the terms of s 4D(1)(b)%%lst%% which speaks ]n[ of human ]v[ corporate actors ]b[ of the provision itself having the purpose of preventing%%lst%% restricting ]v[ limiting the supply ]v[ acquisition of the relevant goods ]v[ services%%per%%]$~ 
~$[A construction which fixes upon subjective intent also may be difficult to apply to a multipartite contract%%lst%% arrangement ]v[ understanding%%per%%]$~ 
~$[However%%lst%% s 4F of the Act doubtless has a role to play in such circumstances%%per%% 
%%per%%%%per%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The operation of s 4F upon provisions stated to have a particular purpose is significant%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The phrase %%dqt%%the provision was included in the contract %%per%%%%per%%%%per%% ]f[ that purpose ]v[ ]f[ purposes that included ]v[ include that purpose%%dqt%% suggests that s 4F requires examination of the purposes of the individuals by whom the provision was included in the contract%%lst%% arrangement ]v[ understanding in question%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Moreover%%lst%% s 4F contemplates that a provision may be included in a contract%%lst%% arrangement ]v[ understanding ]f[ a plurality of purposes and%%lst%% in such circumstances%%lst%% directs that the relevant purpose must be %%dqt%%substantial%%dqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[This is a further indication that the Act requires examination of the purposes of individuals%%lst%% the inevitable multiplicity of which may be contrasted with an examination of the %%dqt%%objective%%dqt%% purpose of an impugned provision%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In this way%%lst%% the introduction of a %%dqt%%substantial purpose%%dqt%% test avoids difficulties in discerning the relevant purpose of multiple parties to a contract%%lst%% arrangement ]v[ understanding%%sqt%%%%per%%

2401 In this passage%%lst%% Gummow J was ]n[ specifically addressing the issue confronting me%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It is %%cmp_tf%% ]n[ surprising that the passage does ]n[ speak unequivocally to that issue%%per%%]$~ 
~$[I think that his Honour%%sqt%%s observations are capable of bearing the meaning attributed to them by Seven%%per%%]$~ 
~$[On the other hand%%lst%% as News suggests%%lst%% Gummow J may have been concerned only to explain why the %%sqt%% substantial purpose %%sqt%% test in s 4F of the TP Act suggests that s 4D (and presumably s 45(2)) applies where the subjective purpose of the parties responsible ]f[ the provision%%lst%% rather %%cmp_ta%% an objectively ascertained purpose%%lst%% included the substantial lessening of competition%%per%% 
14%%per%%6%%per%%2%%per%%3 PREFERRED CONSTRUCTION 
2402 Since the particular question of construction I have identified is ]n[ concluded by authority%%lst%% I must express my own view%%per%%]$~ 
~$[This is no easy task%%lst%% %%cmp_b%% the text of ss 45(2) ]^[ 4F of the TP Act is of even less assistance %%cmp_ta%% usual in cases of statutory ambiguity%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The fundamental reason ]f[ this is that%%lst%% as Gummow J noted in News v South Sydney (in relation to s 4D)%%lst%% s 45(2) of the TP Act does ]n[ speak of human ]v[ corporate actions%%lst%% ]b[ of the provision itself having the purpose of substantially lessening competition%%per%%]$~ 
~$[A process of judicial exegesis has taken the rather curious statutory language to refer to a subjective purpose%%cln%% cf News v South Sydney 215 CLR%%lst%% at 580 [41]%%lst%% per McHugh J%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It is ]n[ surprising in these circumstances that s 4F does ]n[ clearly indicate whether it is directed to the position of a single corporation which has multiple purposes ]v[ to that of a number of corporations each of which has a different purpose ]v[ set of purposes%%per%% 
2403 McHugh J said in News v South Sydney 215 CLR%%lst%% at 580 [42]%%lst%% that%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%Questions of construction are notorious ]f[ generating opposing answers%%lst%% none of which can be said to be either clearly right ]v[ clearly wrong%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Frequently%%lst%% there is simply no %%dqt%%right%%dqt%% answer to a question of construction%%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In my view%%lst%% this is a prime example%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Nonetheless%%lst%% on balance%%lst%% I prefer a construction that limits the operation of s 45(2) to cases where the substantial purpose of each of the parties responsible ]f[ including the relevant provision in a contract is to substantially lessen competition%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Several factors point to this conclusion%%per%% 
2404 First%%lst%% %%cmp_if%% Seven%%sqt%%s construction of ss 45(2) ]^[ 4F is correct%%lst%% a party to a contract may be exposed ]n[ only to claims ]f[ damages ]^[ other relief%%lst%% ]b[ to civil penalties under the TP Act %%cmp_b%% another party to the contract has included a provision ]f[ the %%sqt%% substantial purpose %%sqt%% of substantially lessening competition%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The %%sqt%% innocent%%sqt%% party will be liable to penalties notwithstanding that it had neither knowledge of%%lst%% nor a reasonable opportunity to ascertain%%lst%% the substantial anti%%dsh%%competitive purpose of the other party ]v[ parties%%per%% 
2405 A hypothetical example loosely based on the present case illustrates the point%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The AFL might have been held liable under s 45(2) of the TP Act ]f[ entering into the AFL%%dsh%%News Licence %%cmp_if%%%%lst%% entirely unknown to it%%lst%% News%%sqt%% purposes ]f[ obtaining the AFL broadcasting rights included the substantial purpose of lessening competition%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It is true that an innocent party%%lst%% like the AFL in this hypothetical example%%lst%% would only be liable %%cmp_if%% it was also responsible ]f[ including the relevant provision in the agreement%%per%%]$~ 
~$[But it is easy to envisage circumstances in which one party responsible ]f[ including a provision in a contract has no inkling of the anti%%dsh%%competitive purpose of another party sharing responsibility ]f[ including the provision in the contract%%per%% 
2406 Seven points out that s 45(2) of the TP Act already imposes a form of strict liability%%lst%% in that a party to a contract may be held liable by reason of the anti%%dsh%%competitive effect of the provision of that contract%%lst%% whether ]v[ ]n[ the party recognises the effect%%per%%]$~ 
~$[However%%lst%% on the construction of s 45(2) that I have held in Chapter 13 to be the better view%%lst%% the issue will be whether%%lst%% at the relevant time (the making of ]v[ giving effect to the contract) the provision has already had the effect of substantially lessening competition ]v[ is likely to have that effect%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Ordinarily%%lst%% all parties to a contract are in a position to assess objectively the actual ]v[ likely effect on competition of a particular provision in a contract%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Ascertaining the subjective purpose ]v[ purposes of a contracting partner ]f[ including a provision in the contract is likely to be a very different undertaking%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Not only does the innocent party have to assess the various purposes of each of the other parties to the contract%%lst%% ]b[ it has to make an assessment of the substantiality of any anti%%dsh%%competitive purpose in relation to the other purposes held by each%%per%% 
2407 Secondly%%lst%% on Seven%%sqt%%s construction of ss 45(2) ]^[ 4F of the TP Act%%lst%% the Court is required to evaluate the collective substantiality of anti%%dsh%%competitive purposes among a range of purposes held (or ]n[ held) by multiple contracting parties%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The Court%%lst%% on this approach%%lst%% is required to go beyond ascertaining the varying purposes held by each of the parties to the contract%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It must determine whether the proscribed purpose is a substantial purpose when%%lst%% by hypothesis%%lst%% that purpose has ]n[ been held by one ]v[ more of the parties responsible ]f[ inclusion of the particular provision in the contract%%per%% 
2408 There is no shortage of difficult judgments the TP Act requires the Court to make %%per%%]$~ 
~$[But any assessment of the substantiality of a particular subjective purpose held by some%%lst%% ]b[ ]n[ all%%lst%% parties to a contract necessarily moves away from any meaningful assessment of subjective purpose%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Inevitably it must rely on objective criteria such as (in Seven%%sqt%%s language) %%sqt%% the degrees of responsibility of the various parties ]f[ the inclusion of the provision %%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It is difficult to see how an assessment of this kind can be reconciled with the insistence of the High Court in News v South Sydney that s 4D (and%%lst%% accordingly%%lst%% s 45(2)) is concerned with the subjective purpose of those parties to a contract responsible ]f[ the inclusion of a particular provision in the contract%%per%% 
2409 Thirdly%%lst%% as I have already noted%%lst%% s 45 is a penal provision%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Accordingly%%lst%% the Court approaches its construction%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%using the ordinary rules of statutory construction ]^[ interpretation%%lst%% ]b[ recognising that %%cmp_if%% as a matter of last resort%%lst%% after those rules are applied%%lst%% the language of the statute remains ambiguous ]v[ doubtful such ambiguity ]v[ doubt may be resolved in favour of the subject%%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Australian Competition ]^[ Consumer Commission v Liquorland (Australia) Pty Ltd [2006] ATPR 42%%dsh%%123%%lst%% at 45,184 [45]%%lst%% per Allsop J%%per%%]$~ 
~$[As Allsop J pointed out in that case (at 45,185 [47])%%lst%% this does ]n[ mean that the Court adopts a literal analysis %%sqt%% with an eye to the discernment of textual ambiguity through finely spun distinctions %%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[However%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%provisions of the [ TP Act ] which are intended to govern ]^[ effect business decisions ]^[ commercial behaviour should%%lst%% %%cmp_if%% such a construction is fairly open%%lst%% be construed in such a way as to enable the business person%%lst%% before he ]v[ she acts%%lst%% to know with some certainty whether ]v[ ]n[ the act contemplated is lawful%%sqt%%%%per%%]$~

2410 In my view%%lst%% the present is a case ]f[ the application of these principles%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Unless the construction urged by the Consortium Respondents is adopted%%lst%% there is a clear risk that corporations ]^[ individuals will be exposed to penalties ]f[ commercial decisions that involve neither a conscious determination to engage in anti%%dsh%%competitive conduct%%lst%% nor an opportunity to ascertain that anti%%dsh%%competitive conduct has occurred ]v[ is likely to occur%%per%% 
2411 Mr Sumption argued in his oral submissions that %%cmp_if%% there can be no contravention of s 45(2) of the TP Act unless all those responsible ]f[ including a provision in the contract have the proscribed anti%%dsh%%competitive purpose%%lst%% there is a danger that a person who deliberately sets out to subvert competition will avoid the consequences by contracting with a commercial innocent%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Perhaps there is such a risk%%lst%% ]b[ it is ameliorated by the fact that s 45(2) applies whenever the contractual provision is likely to have the effect of substantially lessening competition%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Moreover%%lst%% the risk Mr Sumption identifies is more %%cmp_ta%% matched%%lst%% in my opinion%%lst%% by the risk that an innocent party will be held liable by reason of the unascertainable purpose ]v[ purposes of other parties to the contract%%per%%]$~ 
~$[This would have the result%%lst%% in a multi%%dsh%%party contract%%lst%% that only those with the proscribed purpose would contravene s 45(2) by making ]v[ giving effect to the contract ]v[ giving effect to the provision%%per%% 
2413 None of the parties supported this construction ]^[ Mr Sumption specifically disavowed it%%per%%]$~

14%%per%%6%%per%%3%%per%%1 SEVEN%%sqt%%S CONTENTION 
2414 Seven submits that a contravention of s 45(2) by reason of a proscribed purpose is predicated upon effecting specific mental states%%lst%% as opposed to the realisation of a particular state of affairs%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Seven points out that a party may have a proscribed purpose to do that which is impossible to achieve%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It identifies three types of impossibility%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%(a) logical (the means chosen could not%%lst%% in any possible circumstances%%lst%% have effected the objective sought)%%scn%%

14%%per%%6%%per%%3%%per%%2 UNIVERSAL MUSIC V ACCC 
2416 Seven%%sqt%%s starting point ]f[ this argument is correct%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In Universal Music Australia Pty Ltd v Australian Competition ]^[ Consumer Commission [2003] FCAFC 193 %%scn%% (2003) 131 FCR 529%%lst%% the Full Court said this in the context of an analysis of s 47 of the TP Act (at 587 [249])%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%A person may have the purpose of securing a result which it is%%lst%% in fact%%lst%% impossible ]f[ that person to achieve%%per%%]$~ 
~$[That no doubt explains the reference to purpose%%lst%% in para (a) of s 47(10) of the Act%%lst%% as an alternative to effect ]^[ likely effect%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The paragraph is satisfied %%cmp_if%% the relevant corporation has the requisite purpose%%lst%% regardless of whether ]v[ ]n[ that purpose has been%%lst%% ]v[ was ]v[ is likely to be%%lst%% achieved%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It may conceivably be satisfied even in a case where the court finds the purpose could never in fact have been achieved%%scn%% although that finding would be relevant in determining whether to infer the proscribed purpose%%sqt%%%%per%% 
2417 As Seven suggests%%lst%% there are circumstances in which a party to a contract might be found to have the purpose of substantially lessening competition even though the relevant contractual provision cannot have the effect ]v[ likely effect of substantially lessening competition in a market%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Examples are where the anti%%dsh%%competitive conduct is nipped in the bud by the regulator ]v[ the market participants to whom the alleged contravenor%%sqt%%s conduct is directed refused to bow to persuasion ]v[ threats%%cln%% Universal Music v ACCC 131 FCR%%lst%% at 586 [246]%%lst%% per curiam %%per%%]$~ 
~$[Viewed from the time the allegedly contravening conducts occurs%%lst%% an objective observer might conclude that there never had been any possibility of a substantial lessening of competition in any existing market%%per%% 
2418 The Court in Universal Music v ACCC did not%%lst%% however%%lst%% hold that a proscribed purpose will be present where the object sought to be achieved by those including a provision in a contract is incapable of substantially lessening competition in any existing market%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The proposition accepted in that case was that a party may have the purpose required ]f[ contravention of s 47 (and%%lst%% it follows%%lst%% s 45(2))%%lst%% even though the purpose could never be achieved in practice%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The Court did ]n[ need to consider whether a party can have the proscribed purpose of substantially lessening competition in a market %%cmp_if%% the object to be achieved can only substantially lessen competition in a market which%%lst%% by hypothesis%%lst%% does ]n[ exist%%per%% 
2419 In Universal Music v ACCC %%lst%% there was no real dispute that the relevant market was the wholesale market ]f[ recorded music in Australia (131 FCR%%lst%% at 542 [34])%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The material question arising in that case was whether the appellants had engaged in certain conduct ]f[ the purpose of substantially lessening competition%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The conduct involved closing the accounts of music retailers in order to deter them from engaging in the lawful parallel importation of recordings under particular labels%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The retailers whose accounts were closed were all small traders%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Thus the cessation of supply to them could have had no significant effect on competition in the wholesale market ]f[ recorded music%%per%% 
2420 Nonetheless%%lst%% the Full Court considered that the appellant%%sqt%%s objective was to snuff out intra%%dsh%%brand competition before it gained a foothold%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The Court upheld a finding%%lst%% based on the whole of the evidence%%lst%% that each corporate appellant had the purpose of deterring all its retail account holders from purchasing parallel imports (131 FCR%%lst%% at 591 [264])%%per%% 
2421 The Court %%cmp_t%% proceeded to consider whether that purpose involved a substantial lessening of competition in the relevant market%%lst%% within the meaning of s 47(1)(a) of the TP Act %%per%%]$~ 
~$[Their Honours reasoned as follows (131 FCR%%lst%% at 591 [265]%%dsh%%%%dsh%%%%dsh%%[266])%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%It certainly involved a purpose of substantially lessening (but ]n[ altogether eliminating) competition with PolyGram ]^[ Warner%%lst%% as the case may be%%lst%% in respect of their own labels%%per%%]$~ 
~$[But the competition contemplated by s 47(10)(a) is competition in the relevant market considered as a whole%%scn%% ]n[ competition with a particular market participant%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Whether the purpose of lessening competition with a particular market participant amounts also to the purpose of substantially lessening competition in the market must depend upon the facts of the particular case%%scn%% a matter of major importance being that participant%%sqt%%s market share%%per%%]$~

14%%per%%6%%per%%3%%per%%4 ASCERTAINING WHETHER THE PURPOSE IS TO SUBSTANTIALLY LESSEN COMPETITION 
2428 The conclusion I have reached on the application of s 45(2) to a non%%dsh%%existent market does ]n[ mean that a contravention of s 45(2) of the TP Act requires proof that the alleged contravenor subjectively appreciated the precise nature of the market in which competition would be lessened%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Often the party concerned would simply ]n[ have adverted to this question%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Whether the proscribed purpose has been proven may be a matter of inference from all the circumstances%%lst%% including the objective evidence%%cln%% Universal Music v ACCC 131 FCR%%lst%% at 588%%dsh%%589 [256]%%lst%% 589%%dsh%%590 [259]%%dsh%%%%dsh%%%%dsh%%[261]%%per%% 
2429 Nor does the conclusion I have reached mean that the impossibility of the alleged contravenor achieving its objective immunises it against a contravention of s 45(2) of the TP Act based on an anti%%dsh%%competitive purpose%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The fact that the alleged contravenor could never have effectuated its objective%%lst%% ]f[ example %%cmp_b%% the regulator had already intervened ]v[ %%cmp_b%% target corporations were resistant to threats ]v[ blandishments%%lst%% is ]n[ necessarily fatal to the existence of the practice proscribed by s 45(2)%%per%% 
2430 The question posed by s 45(2)(a)(ii) ]^[ (b)(ii)%%lst%% in my view%%lst%% is whether the object sought to be achieved by the alleged contravenor%%lst%% %%cmp_if%% effectuated%%lst%% is capable of substantially lessening competition%%per%%]$~ 
~$[If so%%lst%% a contravention of s 45(2) may be made out regardless of whether the alleged contravenor appreciated that the objective%%lst%% %%cmp_if%% achieved%%lst%% would substantially lessen competition in any existing market%%per%%]$~ 
~$[On the other hand%%lst%% %%cmp_if%% the objective%%lst%% even %%cmp_if%% achieved%%lst%% was incapable of substantially lessening competition in an existing market%%lst%% no contravention of s 45(2)(a)(ii) ]v[ (b)(ii) will be established%%per%%]$~ 
~$[As News v South Sydney explains%%lst%% the purpose with which s 45(2) is concerned is the end sought to be achieved%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The end sought to be achieved will ]n[ usually be framed by the alleged contravenor in terms of a particular market%%per%%]$~ 
~$[More commonly%%lst%% the objective will be framed more prosaically%%lst%% such as deterring retailers of recordings from lawfully engaging in parallel importation of the product%%per%%]$~

~$[If not%%lst%% no contravention can be established%%per%% 
14%%per%%7 Did the Consortium Respondents Have the Purpose of Substantially Lessening Competition? 
2432 It follows from what I have said that a party to a contract may have a substantial purpose of substantially lessening competition without specifically adverting to questions of market definition%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The critical factual issue is the object that party sought to achieve by including the relevant provision in the contract%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Once identified%%lst%% the question is whether the object%%lst%% %%cmp_if%% actually achieved%%lst%% was realistically capable of substantially lessening competition in an existing market%%per%% 
2433 Seven%%sqt%%s purpose case rests on the contention that the parties to the Master Agreement Provision ]^[ to the other contracts upon which Seven relies had the object of %%sqt%% killing C7 %%sqt%% %%dsh%%%%dsh%%%%dsh%% that is%%lst%% eliminating C7 as an entity capable of carrying on business in the various pleaded markets%%per%%]$~ 
~$[I have found that the only pleaded market that existed at the times the Master Agreement ]v[ other contracts ]v[ arrangements were made (or the provisions given effect) was the retail pay television market%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Thus%%lst%% assuming Seven can establish that the parties had the alleged object ]v[ purpose of killing C7%%lst%% the question is whether that was an object ]v[ purpose which%%lst%% %%cmp_if%% effected%%lst%% was realistically capable of substantially lessening competition in the retail pay television market%%per%% 
2434 In Chapter 12%%lst%% I have found that neither the Master Agreement Provision nor any of the other provisions relied on by Seven was likely to have the effect (in the sense that there was a real chance they would have the effect) of substantially lessening competition in the retail pay television market%%per%%]$~ 
~$[These findings were made on the assumption that the provisions were likely (in the same sense) to have the effect of causing C7 to cease business %%cmp_b%% the acquisition of both the AFL ]^[ NRL pay television rights by News ]^[ Fox Sports would have denied C7 inputs essential to its survival%%per%%]$~ 
~$[That being so%%lst%% the impugned conduct was ]n[ likely (in the relevant sense) to have had the effect of substantially lessening competition in the retail pay television market%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Any lessening was going to occur in any event%%per%% 
2435 In my view%%lst%% these considerations must be taken into account in assessing Seven%%sqt%%s purpose case under s 45(2) of the TP Act %%per%%]$~ 
~$[That case rests on the contention that each of the Consortium Respondents had the objective of killing C7%%per%%]$~ 
~$[For present purposes I assume that the factual contention can be made out (this factual issue is addressed ]f[ Telstra in this Chapter ]^[ ]f[ the other Consortium Respondents in Chapter 15)%%per%% 
2436 The critical question%%lst%% %%cmp_t%%%%lst%% is whether that objective%%lst%% assuming it to have been carried into effect%%lst%% was realistically capable of substantially lessening competition in the retail pay television market%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The answer to that question is%%lst%% in my opinion%%lst%% no%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The demise of C7 would ]n[ have led to any substantial lessening of competition in the retail pay television market%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Any lessening of competition in that market would have occurred in any event%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In other words%%lst%% regardless of C7%%sqt%%s fate%%lst%% Optus would have ceased to provide even weak competition to Foxtel in the retail pay television market%%per%% 
2437 Seven does ]n[ seem to make any submission in support of its pleaded case that the Consortium Respondents had the objective of killing C7 in order to prevent it entering the retail pay television market via the Telstra Cable%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Be that as it may%%lst%% I have found that C7 never had any genuine intention to avail itself of retail access via the Telstra Cable%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Thus the demise of C7 would ]n[ have prevented it entering the retail pay television market since it had no intention of doing ]s[ in any event%%per%% 
2438 For these reasons%%lst%% Seven%%sqt%%s purpose case under s 45(2) must fail%%per%%]$~ 
~$[This conclusion applies to each of the six provisions on which Seven relies ]f[ its case%%per%%

~$[Provisions Other Than the Master Agreement Provision 
2439 In view of this conclusion%%lst%% it is ]n[ strictly necessary to consider whether the parties to the various provisions relied on by Seven had the shared purpose of substantially lessening competition in the retail pay television market%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Nonetheless%%lst%% I propose to do so%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In this section%%lst%% I explain why Seven cannot make out that the parties to the Nine Put Provision%%lst%% the News%%dsh%%Nine Licence Provision%%lst%% the Rights Sub%%dsh%%Licence Provision ]^[ the NRL Bidding Agreement Provisions had the shared purpose of substantially lessening competition%%per%%]$~ 
~$[For reasons I shall explain%%lst%% the News%%dsh%%Foxtel Licence Provision falls into a separate category%%per%% 
2440 In the following section%%lst%% I consider whether the parties responsible ]f[ the inclusion of the Master Agreement Provision in the Master Agreement had the shared purpose of substantially lessening competition%%per%%]$~ 
~$[This requires an assessment of Telstra%%sqt%%s purpose%%per%% 
14%%per%%8%%per%%1 Nine Put Provision 
2441 For reasons I have explained%%lst%% s 45(2) will be contravened by reason of the provision having a proscribed purpose only %%cmp_if%% all parties responsible ]f[ including the relevant provision in the contract share that purpose%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It follows that %%cmp_if%% one ]v[ more parties responsible ]f[ the inclusion of the provision in the contract does ]n[ share the proscribed anti%%dsh%%competitive purpose%%lst%% there can be no contravention of s 45(2)%%per%% 
2442 The Nine Put was entered into between News ]^[ Nine on 14 December 2000%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Nine agreed that%%lst%% %%cmp_if%% required by News%%lst%% it would acquire from News certain of the AFL free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air television rights%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Seven identifies the Nine Put Provision as the term in the Nine Put stipulating that the licence agreement between News ]^[ Nine would require Nine to pay $23 million per annum (plus adjustments) ]^[ contribute contra%%lst%% in return ]f[ the entitlement to take exclusive rights to three AFL matches in each round ]^[ certain other benefits%%per%% 
2443 Seven pleads that News included the Nine Put Provision in the Nine Put ]^[ that it had the purpose of substantially lessening competition in the four markets identified by Seven%%per%%]$~ 
~$[No allegation is made that Nine%%lst%% the other party to the contract%%lst%% shared the proscribed purpose%%per%% 
2444 Seven does ]n[ appear to explain why a finding should be made that only News was responsible ]f[ the inclusion of the relevant provisions in the Foxtel Put%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In any event%%lst%% I am ]n[ satisfied that I should make such a finding%%per%%]$~ 
~$[This was ]n[ a case like ASX v Pont Data %%lst%% where one party to a contract imposed a provision on the other%%lst%% against the express wishes of the latter%%per%%]$~ 
~$[On the contrary%%lst%% Nine was a willing party to the Nine Put%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Although it was News that could trigger the requirement that Nine take the defined AFL free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air television rights%%lst%% both parties understood that News would act in this way %%cmp_if%% ]^[ when it acquired the AFL broadcasting rights%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The Nine Put Provision%%lst%% as identified by Seven%%lst%% was of benefit to Nine since%%lst%% in return ]f[ its promise to pay a fee%%lst%% it effectively received the licence to televise three AFL matches exclusively live each week%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Nine was jointly responsible with News ]f[ including the Nine Put Provision in the Nine Put%%per%% 
2445 For these reasons%%lst%% I conclude that Seven has ]n[ shown that the Nine Put Provision had the purpose of substantially lessening competition within the meaning of s 45(2) of the TP Act %%per%% 
14%%per%%8%%per%%2 News%%dsh%%Nine Licence Provision 
2446 The same reasoning applies to the News%%dsh%%Nine Licence Provision%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It follows that Seven has ]n[ made out that the News%%dsh%%Nine Licence Provision had the purpose of substantially lessening competition within the meaning of s 45(2) of the TP Act %%per%%

2447 Seven pleads that%%lst%% at the time of entering into the Foxtel Put ]^[ the Ten Put%%lst%% there was a contract%%lst%% agreement ]v[ understanding between News%%lst%% Foxtel%%lst%% Nine ]^[ Ten%%lst%% which Seven designates as the Rights Sub%%dsh%%Licence Agreement%%per%%]$~

~$[In Chapter 13 ([2265]ff)%%lst%% I find that Seven has established the existence of the Rights Sub%%dsh%%Licence Agreement as pleaded%%per%% 
2448 Seven alleges that the purpose of News ]^[ Foxtel in entering into the Rights Sub%%dsh%%Licence Agreement%%lst%% which incorporated the Rights Sub%%dsh%%Licence Provision%%lst%% was a substantial lessening of competition%%per%%]$~ 
~$[No allegation is made that Nine ]^[ Ten%%lst%% both parties to the agreement%%lst%% shared that purpose%%per%%

~$[Each of Nine ]^[ Ten%%lst%% ]s[ far as the evidence goes%%lst%% freely entered into the agreement ]^[ agreed to the terms identified by Seven as the Rights Sub%%dsh%%Licence Provision%%per%%]$~

~$[I %%cmp_tf%% conclude that Seven has ]n[ made out its purpose case in relation to the Rights Sub%%dsh%%Licence Provision%%per%%

~$[Seven seeks to meet the problem by submitting that officers of Fox Sports participated in the teleconference of 13 December 2000%%per%%]$~

~$[Seven submits that News was responsible ]f[ formulating both the AFL ]^[ NRL Proposals ]^[ that the Master Agreement Provision resulted from the %%sqt%% capitulation of Telstra %%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[This is said to bring the present case within the principle applied in ASX v Pont Data %%per%% 
2453 The inclusion of the Master Agreement Provision in the Master Agreement (leaving aside the question of whether the two were co%%dsh%%extensive) was ]n[ the responsibility of News alone%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Section 4F of the TP Act speaks of a provision being %%sqt%% included in the contract %%sqt%% ]f[ a particular purpose%%per%%]$~

~$[The fact that one party has formulated ]v[ drafted a provision does ]n[ necessarily mean that that party is exclusively responsible ]f[ including the provision in the contract%%per%%]$~

~$[It follows that %%cmp_if%% Telstra did ]n[ have the purpose of substantially lessening competition%%lst%% Seven cannot establish that the Master Agreement Provision had the purpose proscribed by s 45(2) of the TP Act %%per%%

2456 It will be recalled that Seven%%sqt%%s primary case seems to be ]n[ merely that Telstra was aware that News%%lst%% Foxtel ]^[ PBL had the purpose of killing C7 when entering into the Master Agreement%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Seven seeks to establish that Telstra joined in that purpose when agreeing to the Master Agreement Provision%%per%%]$~

2459 Before addressing whether Telstra agreed to the Master Agreement Provision knowing that News%%lst%% Foxtel ]^[ PBL had the purpose of substantially lessening competition%%lst%% a threshold question arises%%per%%]$~ 
~$[When considering whether a corporation has entered into%%lst%% ]v[ given effect to%%lst%% a contract with the subjective purpose of substantially lessening competition%%lst%% whose thought processes are to be taken into account in making the assessment of purpose? 
2460 As the Privy Council explained in Meridian Global Funds Management Asia Ltd v Securities Commission [1995] 2 AC 500 %%lst%% the search is ]n[ ]f[ the %%sqt%% directing mind ]^[ will %%sqt%% of the corporation%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Rather the task is to apply the relevant %%sqt%% rules of attribution %%sqt%% that determine which acts count as those of the corporation%%per%%]$~ 
~$[That in turn depends on the proper construction of the substantive rule%%per%% 
2461 Section 45(2) of the TP Act%%lst%% read with s 4F%%lst%% directs attention to the subjective purpose of the corporation ]v[ corporations responsible ]f[ including a provision in a contract%%per%%]$~ 
~$[To determine the purpose of the corporation it is necessary to ascertain the persons within the corporation who made the decision to include the provision in the relevant contract%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In a particular case this might involve questions of authority under the corporation%%sqt%%s constitution%%lst%% ]b[ no such issue arises here%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The question is who were the decision%%dsh%%makers within Telstra responsible ]f[ the inclusion of the Master Agreement Provision%%per%% 
2462 In my view%%lst%% the evidence clearly establishes that the decision%%dsh%%makers within Telstra in relation to Telstra%%sqt%%s commitment to the Master Agreement Provision were Dr Switkowski ]^[ Mr Akhurst%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Seven%%lst%% anticipating a finding that neither Dr Switkowski nor Mr Akhurst had the objective of killing C7%%lst%% seeks to characterise Mr Greg Willis as a decision%%dsh%%maker%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Seven%%sqt%%s Reply Submissions point out that Mr Willis was present at the Foxtel Management board meeting of 9 November 2000 which gave approval in principle to Foxtel entering a put option at a fee of $17%%per%%5 million per annum ]f[ three pay television games per week%%per%% 
2463 It is important to bear in mind that there was a serious division of opinion within Telstra as to the commercial value to Foxtel of acquiring the AFL pay television rights ]f[ $30 million per annum by means of News%%sqt%% exercise of the Foxtel Put%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Fogarty ]^[ Mr Greg Willis%%lst%% among others%%lst%% were opposed to Telstra supporting the News bid%%lst%% even at a fee of $17%%per%%5 million per annum%%per%%]$~

2466 These are three findings%%lst%% ]v[ sets of findings%%lst%% that are particularly important in determining whether Telstra shared any anti%%dsh%%competitive purpose with the other parties to the Master Agreement Provision in the sense advanced by Seven%%per%%]$~ 
~$[First%%lst%% as I have explained%%lst%% I accept Dr Switkowski%%sqt%%s evidence as to his state of mind ]^[ reasoning process in giving Telstra%%sqt%%s support to the bids ]f[ the AFL ]^[ NRL pay television rights%%per%%]$~ 
~$[I have made specific findings concerning these matters in Chapters 8 ]^[ 9%%per%% 
2467 In addition%%lst%% I find that Dr Switkowski was ]n[ told of any concerns within Telstra as to the possibility that News%%lst%% Foxtel ]v[ PBL wished to kill C7%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Even Seven%%sqt%%s Closing Submissions acknowledge that Dr Switkowski%%sqt%%s denial that he was unaware of the %%sqt%% kill C7%%sqt%% statements made by Mr Blomfield to Telstra officers %%sqt%% probably [had] the ring of truth %%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The killing of C7 formed no part of his objective in committing Telstra to the Master Agreement Provision%%per%%]$~ 
~$[More particularly%%lst%% Dr Switkowski was ]n[ aware that any other party to the Master Agreement had the objective of killing C7%%per%%]$~ 
~$[He did ]n[ commit Telstra to the Master Agreement Provision knowing that it was designed to kill C7%%per%% 
2468 Secondly%%lst%% although I have some reservations about aspects of Mr Akhurst%%sqt%%s evidence%%lst%% I accept the substance of his explanation as to his state of mind ]^[ objectives in deciding to support Fox Sports%%sqt%% bid ]f[ the NRL pay television rights ]^[ (to the extent his contribution was important) the Foxtel Put in relation to the AFL pay television rights%%per%%]$~ 
~$[While I consider that Mr Akhurst appreciated that there was a risk that %%cmp_if%% Seven lost the AFL pay television rights C7%%sqt%%s survival would be threatened%%lst%% he saw this as an incident of the ordinary processes of competition ]f[ the AFL pay television rights%%per%% 
2469 Mr Akhurst wanted Foxtel to have the AFL pay television rights %%cmp_b%% he thought they were important ]f[ the success of the business ]^[ %%cmp_b%% he thought the rights would give Foxtel greater control over its own destiny%%per%%]$~ 
~$[He was influenced in his judgment by Mr Chisholm%%sqt%%s strong advocacy of Foxtel acquiring the AFL pay television rights ]^[ by Dr Switkowski%%sqt%%s assessment of the benefits flowing from Telstra%%sqt%%s support of the Foxtel Put%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Akhurst also saw benefits to Telstra in its role in supporting the Fox Sports bid%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Akhurst was ]n[ aware that News%%lst%% PBL ]v[ Foxtel had the objective of killing C7 (if they did)%%per%%]$~ 
~$[His objective was to secure commercial advantages ]f[ Foxtel ]^[ Telstra%%per%% 
2470 Thirdly%%lst%% a good deal of the cross%%dsh%%examination of Dr Switkowski ]^[ Mr Akhurst appeared to be directed to showing that Telstra%%sqt%%s decision to agree to the Master Agreement Provision was motivated%%lst%% in part at least%%lst%% by a desire to improve relations with News ]^[ PBL%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It was put to both that Telstra was interested in Foxtel expanding the scope of its activities%%lst%% thus increasing the value of Telstra%%sqt%%s interest in Foxtel%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Dr Switkowski ]^[ Mr Akhurst each accepted that one factor in their decision was a desire to improve relations between Telstra ]^[ the other Foxtel partners%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Perhaps in other circumstances the desire to improve the relationship might have provided a motive ]f[ Telstra to adopt ]v[ support News%%sqt%% ]v[ PBL%%sqt%%s anti%%dsh%%competitive objectives (assuming they existed)%%per%%]$~ 
~$[But the evidence does ]n[ demonstrate that in this case the desire to improve relations with the Foxtel partners prompted Dr Switkowski ]v[ Mr Akhurst to adopt ]v[ support any anti%%dsh%%competitive objective that News ]v[ PBL may have sought to achieve%%per%% 
14%%per%%9%%per%%2%%per%%3 SEVEN%%sqt%%S KEY POINTS 
2471 I have identified the %%sqt%% key points %%sqt%% relied on by Seven to support its contention that Telstra had the purpose proscribed by s 45(2) of the TP Act%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Some of the points%%lst%% in effect%%lst%% have been answered by the findings I have made%%per%%]$~ 
~$[For example%%lst%% although it is true that Mr Willis was very concerned about the validity of Foxtel%%sqt%%s modelling%%lst%% Dr Switkowski formed his own assessment that the assumptions%%lst%% although aggressive%%lst%% could be achieved in practice%%per%% 
2472 In this connection%%lst%% Seven%%sqt%%s submissions sometimes appear to proceed on the basis that changes to a financial model frequently reflect a manipulative ]^[ perhaps dishonest determination to reach a pre%%dsh%%determined %%sqt%% bottom line %%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It is quite clear from the evidence that modelling can serve a number of purposes%%per%%]$~ 
~$[One is to predict likely financial outcomes given particular assumptions which represent the best estimate that can be made of the future effect of crucial variables%%lst%% such as penetration rates%%lst%% subscription fees ]^[ programming costs%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Another is to identify the targets that must be achieved in order to produce profitable outcomes%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Obviously enough%%lst%% altering the assumptions underlying a particular model may have a malign purpose%%lst%% depending on the circumstances%%per%%]$~ 
~$[But reconstituting a model ]s[ as to change a negative NPV to a positive NPV is ]n[ necessarily a cynical exercise%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Indeed%%lst%% %%cmp_if%% the changes in assumptions are clearly identified%%lst%% it is hard to see how a sophisticated reader can be misled%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It is odd that Seven should be ]s[ critical of the modelling within News ]^[ Foxtel%%lst%% when it was quite prepared to make offers involving commitments of hundreds of millions of dollars with no modelling at all%%per%% 
2473 Seven relies on the fact that Dr Switkowski ]^[ Mr Akhurst were aware that Optus ]^[ Austar could terminate their content supply agreements %%cmp_if%% Seven lost the AFL pay television rights%%per%%]$~ 
~$[But that fact is in no way inconsistent with both of them being unaware of any purpose News%%lst%% PBL ]^[ Foxtel may have had of substantially lessening competition%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Similarly%%lst%% as I have already explained%%lst%% the fact that Mr Akhurst appreciated that the loss of the AFL pay television rights created a risk that C7 might ]n[ survive is consistent with him believing (as he did) that any such consequence would flow from the ordinary processes of competition in relation to the AFL pay television rights%%per%% 
2474 Perhaps Seven%%sqt%%s principal %%sqt%% key point %%sqt%% is that Telstra was informed by Mr Blomfield in two conversations with Mr Fogarty in October ]v[ early November 2000 that Foxtel%%sqt%%s purpose was to kill C7%%per%% 
(The second conversation included other Telstra officers%%per%% 
) Seven also points to two emails from Mr Brenton Willis to Mr Fogarty%%lst%% on 11 ]^[ 13 December 2000 respectively%%lst%% which refer to Mr Blomfield having stated to Telstra that Foxtel had the objective of killing C7%%per%% 
2475 The fundamental difficulty facing Seven is that there is no evidence that Mr Willis%%sqt%% emails came to Mr Akhurst%%sqt%%s attention%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The emails were ]n[ forwarded to him ]^[ they were ]n[ referred to in any subsequent correspondence that came to his attention%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Akhurst denied in his written statement that he became aware of the emails at the material times%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Akhurst also denied that he had been told that Foxtel ]v[ News had the wider objective of killing C7 ]v[ that Mr Blomfield had made statements to that effect%%per%% 
2476 Mr Akhurst was ]n[ seriously challenged on his evidence that he had ]n[ seen the emails%%per%%]$~ 
~$[This is ]n[ surprising%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The second email was sent to Mr Fogarty nine minutes before the teleconference of 13 December 2000 actually commenced%%per%%]$~ 
~$[At the time%%lst%% Mr Fogarty was in Sydney ]^[ Mr Akhurst was with Dr Switkowski in Melbourne%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Fogarty had the opportunity to refer to Mr Willis%%sqt%% first email in his (Mr Fogarty%%sqt%%s) briefing papers%%lst%% forwarded to Mr Akhurst on 13 December 2000%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Fogarty did ]n[ do so%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Indeed%%lst%% Mr Fogarty (who was a party to both conversations with Mr Blomfield) never referred to the conversations in any written ]v[ electronic communications with Mr Akhurst%%per%% 
2477 Mr Akhurst was asked in cross%%dsh%%examination%%lst%% somewhat obliquely%%lst%% whether anybody at Telstra had mentioned to him that a Foxtel representative had indicated that Foxtel wanted to kill C7%%per%%]$~ 
~$[He denied that any such thing had been said ]^[ was ]n[ pressed further on the issue%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Because of my reservations about aspects of Mr Akhurst%%sqt%% evidence%%lst%% I have carefully considered whether I should accept his denial%%lst%% notwithstanding that the issue was ]n[ pressed in cross%%dsh%%examination%%per%%]$~ 
~$[I have taken into account that Telstra called neither Mr Fogarty nor Mr Brenton Willis as witnesses%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In the end%%lst%% however%%lst%% the issue turns on whether I accept Mr Akhurst%%sqt%%s denial%%per%% 
2478 In my view%%lst%% Mr Akhurst%%sqt%%s denial receives support ]n[ only from the fact that Mr Fogarty chose ]n[ to comment in writing ]v[ via electronic means on Mr Willis%%sqt%% emails after 11 December 2000%%lst%% ]b[ from the absence of any reference to the conversation with Mr Blomfield in any of Mr Fogarty%%sqt%%s communications to Mr Akhurst%%per%%]$~ 
~$[There are many possible reasons why Mr Fogarty chose ]n[ to refer to Mr Blomfield%%sqt%%s comments%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Perhaps the most obvious is that he gave the comments little credence ]v[ that he understood them to be hyperbole on Mr Blomfield%%sqt%%s part%%per%% 
2479 It is of course possible that Mr Fogarty did ]n[ refer to the conversations in memoranda ]v[ emails %%cmp_b%% he informed Mr Akhurst verbally%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Given the strong differences of opinion on the question of the Foxtel Put ]^[ the indication that Mr Fogarty was by no means shy in expressing his views%%lst%% I think this is very unlikely%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In any event%%lst%% I accept Mr Akhurst%%sqt%%s denial that he was told of Mr Blomfield%%sqt%%s comments%%per%% 
14%%per%%10 News%%dsh%%Foxtel Licence Provision 
2480 I have concluded that none of the provisions relied on by Seven had the purpose of substantially lessening competition %%cmp_b%% the objective (killing C7)%%lst%% even %%cmp_if%% achieved%%lst%% could ]n[ have substantially lessened competition in the only relevant market%%lst%% the retail pay television market%%per%%]$~ 
~$[This conclusion applies to the News%%dsh%%Foxtel Licence Provision as it does to the other provisions on which Seven relies%%per%%

~$[SEVEN%%sqt%%S PURPOSE CASE AGAINST NEWS%%lst%% FOXTEL AND PBL 
2483 As I have explained%%lst%% the conclusions I have reached in Chapter 14 make it strictly unnecessary ]f[ me to make findings about the purpose of News%%lst%% Foxtel (Sky Cable ]^[ Telstra Media in partnership) ]^[ PBL in the context of Seven%%sqt%%s case under s 45(2) of the TP Act %%per%%]$~ 
~$[However%%lst%% such findings will be important %%cmp_if%% the construction I have given to s 45(2) is incorrect%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Moreover%%lst%% findings as to the purpose of News%%lst%% Foxtel ]^[ PBL may be significant ]f[ Seven%%sqt%%s case that Foxtel took advantage of its substantial market power in the retail pay television market in contravention of s 46(1) of the TP Act (dealt with in Chapter 16)%%per%%]$~ 
~$[As I have explained in Chapter 12%%lst%% the findings also have some bearing on questions of market definition%%per%% 
2484 I %%cmp_tf%% consider in this Chapter whether Seven has established that News%%lst%% Foxtel ]^[ PBL had the purpose alleged against them%%lst%% namely to %%sqt%% kill C7 %%sqt%% in order to achieve dominance ]f[ Fox Sports ]^[ thereby substantially lessen competition in the various pleaded markets%%per%%]$~ 
~$[I have outlined in Chapter 14 Seven%%sqt%%s general submissions in relation to the purpose of News%%lst%% Foxtel ]^[ PBL%%lst%% although I supplement the outline in this Chapter%%per%% 
15%%per%%1 Purpose of Destroying a Competitor 
2485 There is something a little odd about Seven%%sqt%%s emphasis upon %%sqt%% killing C7 %%sqt%% as the purpose of Foxtel in entering into the Master Agreement%%lst%% a purpose to which News ]^[ PBL are said to be %%sqt%% privy %%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The oddity stems from the assumption%%lst%% seemingly implicit in Seven%%sqt%%s submissions%%lst%% that the substantial objective of destroying a competitor constitutes%%lst%% of itself%%lst%% the purpose of substantially lessening competition%%per%% 
2486 If this assumption is indeed implicit in Seven%%sqt%%s submissions%%lst%% it seems to me to encounter two obstacles%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The first is a proposition recognised ]n[ only by the Respondents%%sqt%% experts (at considerable length) but%%lst%% more importantly ]f[ my purposes%%lst%% by the High Court%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The proposition is that competition is necessarily ruthless ]^[ that competitors often try to injure ]^[ even eliminate each other%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The second is that when Parliament wishes to characterise a purpose of eliminating ]v[ substantially damaging a competitor as anti%%dsh%%competitive behaviour%%lst%% it says ]s[ specifically ]^[ defines the circumstances in which the behaviour is prohibited%%per%% 
15%%per%%1%%per%%1 Competition ]^[ Competitors 
2487 In relation to the first obstacle%%lst%% Mason CJ ]^[ Wilson J pointed out in Queensland Wire Industries Pty Ltd v Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd [1989] HCA 6 %%scn%% (1989) 167 CLR 177%%lst%% at 191 that%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%the object of s%%per%% 46 is to protect the interests of consumers%%lst%% the operation of the section being predicated on the assumption that competition is a means to that end%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Competition by its very nature is deliberate ]^[ ruthless%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Competitors jockey ]f[ sales%%lst%% the more effective competitors injuring the less effective by taking sales away%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Competitors almost always try to %%dqt%%injure%%dqt%% each other in this way%%per%%]$~ 
~$[This competition has never been a tort %%per%%%%per%%%%per%% ]^[ these injuries are the inevitable consequence of the competition s%%per%% 46 is designed to foster%%sqt%%%%per%% 
2488 In Boral Besser Masonry Ltd v Australian Competition ]^[ Consumer Commission [2003] HCA 5 %%scn%% (2003) 215 CLR 374%%lst%% Gleeson CJ ]^[ Callinan J echoed these observations (at 411%%dsh%%412 [87]%%dsh%%[88])%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%The purpose of the Act is to promote competition%%lst%% ]n[ to protect the private interests of particular persons ]v[ corporations%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Competition damages competitors%%per%%]$~ 
~$[If the damage is sufficiently serious%%lst%% competition may eliminate a competitor%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The critical question in the present case is whether [Boral%%sqt%%s] behaviour involved the taking advantage of a substantial degree of power in a market%%per%%]$~

2489 Later their Honours pointed out that the purposes expressly proscribed by s 46 of the TP Act include the purpose of eliminating ]v[ damaging a competitor%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Their Honours continued (215 CLR%%lst%% at 420 [122]%%dsh%%[123])%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%Where the conduct that is alleged to contravene s 46 is price%%dsh%%cutting%%lst%% the objective will ordinarily be to take business away from competitors%%per%%]$~

~$[That is inherent in the competitive process%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The purpose of the statute is to promote competition%%scn%% ]^[ successful competition is bound to cause damage to some competitors%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It follows that%%lst%% where the conduct alleged to contravene s 46 is competitive pricing%%lst%% it is especially dangerous to proceed too quickly from a finding about purpose to a conclusion about taking advantage of market power%%sqt%%%%per%% 
2490 The difficulty of showing that a desire to cause harm to a competitor is necessarily indicative of an anti%%dsh%%competitive purpose is illustrated by the observation of an American commentator%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Professor Hovenkamp%%lst%% a leading antitrust scholar%%lst%% argues that jury trials in the United States are an unfortunate way to decide contested issues in complex anti%%dsh%%trust cases%%per%%]$~

15%%per%%1%%per%%2 Statutory Prohibitions 
2491 The second obstacle in the path of the assumption apparently underlying Seven%%sqt%%s submissions is that the TP Act %%lst%% ]n[ surprisingly%%lst%% does ]n[ equate an intent to harm a competitor with a purpose of substantially lessening competition%%per%%]$~ 
~$[A corporation contravenes the TP Act %%cmp_if%% it takes advantage of a substantial degree of market power ]f[ the purpose of eliminating ]v[ substantially damaging a competitor%%cln%% s 46(1)(a)%%per%% 
(Seven does ]n[ allege that Foxtel took advantage of its market power ]f[ that purpose%%lst%% although it relies on the other purposes identified in s 46(1))%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Certain kinds of behaviour%%lst%% such as so%%dsh%%called secondary boycotts%%lst%% may contravene the TP Act %%cmp_if%% the corporation engages in the behaviour ]f[ the purpose of causing substantial loss ]v[ damage to the business of another person%%cln%% s 45D(1)(a)(ii)%%per%% 
2492 There is%%lst%% however%%lst%% no general provision in the TP Act which equates an intent to cause harm to a competitor with having the %%sqt%% purpose of %%per%%%%per%%%%per%% substantially lessening competition %%sqt%% (the language used in s 45(2)(a)(ii) ]^[ (b)(ii))%%lst%% even %%cmp_if%% the competitor has a significant share of the relevant market%%per%%]$~ 
~$[If it were otherwise%%lst%% the making of a contract ]f[ the distribution of a technologically superior product%%lst%% designed (literally) to decimate the sales of a competitor ]^[ to destroy the competitor%%lst%% would contravene s 45(2)(a) of the TP Act %%per%%]$~ 
~$[It is difficult to see why%%lst%% in the absence of substantial market power%%lst%% a corporation which seeks legitimate commercial objectives such as the manufacture of superior products should contravene the TP Act %%lst%% even %%cmp_if%% it acts with the deliberate intent of harming competitors%%per%% 
2493 In the course of oral submissions%%lst%% I asked Mr Sumption whether there was a difference between two situations%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The first is where a corporation decides upon a course of action%%lst%% such as the acquisition of sporting rights%%lst%% notwithstanding that its officers contemplate that one consequence of the acquisition will be to force a competitor out of business ]v[ to reduce its operations%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The second is where the officers of the corporation actively desire that the competitor be forced out of business%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Sumption%%sqt%%s answer was as follows%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%There is clearly a difference between contemplating that something will follow ]^[ desiring it%%lst%% ]^[ there is a further difference I suppose between that being your purpose%%per%%]$~ 
~$[You can say%%lst%% %%dqt%%I would be delighted to be rid of these people,%%dqt%% ]b[ nevertheless rebut a suggestion that a transaction that was likely to have that effect was designed to do so%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It is very difficult to rebut that suggestion %%cmp_if%% there is actually no other commercial rationale ]v[ no plausible rationale ]f[ entering into that [transaction]%%sqt%%%%per%% 
2494 Mr Sumption%%sqt%%s response seems to me to imply that %%cmp_if%% a corporation%%lst%% ]n[ having substantial market power%%lst%% has legitimate commercial reasons ]f[ pursuing a particular course of conduct%%lst%% it may be difficult to find that it has engaged in the conduct ]f[ the purpose of substantially lessening competition%%lst%% even %%cmp_if%% its officers contemplate with undisguised pleasure the demise of a competitor as a consequence of the conduct%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The Respondents appear to be content to approach the question of purpose on this basis%%per%% 
15%%per%%2 News%%sqt%% Evidence on Purpose

~$[News submits that the relevant decision%%dsh%%makers ]f[ News (in its own capacity ]^[ as an equal shareholder in Sky Cable%%lst%% one of the Foxtel partners) were Mr Macourt ]^[ Mr Philip%%lst%% although primarily the former since Mr Philip reported to him%%per%%]$~

2496 Mr Macourt said this in his statement%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%My purpose in developing ]^[ procuring the making on behalf of News of the bid ]f[ the AFL free to air ]^[ pay rights was to bring about a situation in which I considered there were reasonable prospects of News being awarded the pay TV rights%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In that event I would have caused News to exercise its put agreement option to FOXTEL%%per%%]$~ 
~$[I considered the acquisition of the AFL rights ultimately by FOXTEL to be in its interests ]^[ %%cmp_tf%% the interests of News%%per%%]$~ 
~$[My purpose in procuring News to enter into the FOXTEL put agreement was to achieve the delivery to FOXTEL of the pay TV rights to the AFL in the event that News was successful in bidding ]f[ those rights%%per%%]$~

2497 Mr Philip%%sqt%%s evidence was to the same effect%%lst%% although a little more specific%%cln%%

15%%per%%3 Seven%%sqt%%s Principal Contentions 
2500 Seven seeks to demonstrate that the purpose of News (and %%cmp_tf%% the purpose of the various provisions relied on by Seven) was to substantially lessen competition by advancing what the Respondents characterise as an %%sqt%% overarching %%sqt%% explanation ]f[ the conduct of News ]^[ Foxtel throughout the period commencing in 1998 until News ]^[ Foxtel succeeded in obtaining the AFL pay television rights in late 2000%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The explanation%%lst%% according to Seven%%lst%% lies in the decision by News ]^[ Foxtel to pursue a strategy of killing C7 as an entity capable of competing in any of the relevant markets%%per%% 
2501 Seven challenges the evidence of Mr Macourt ]^[ Mr Philip%%per%%]$~ 
~$[However%%lst%% Seven mounts its challenge primarily by pointing to many communications ]^[ transactions that it says illustrate ]v[ demonstrate that News ]^[ Foxtel had a substantial objective of killing C7 ]^[ that PBL aligned itself with that objective%%per%% 
2502 It is convenient to commence by examining three propositions that are central to the way Seven puts its case%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The reliability of the claims made by Mr Macourt ]^[ Mr Philip can %%cmp_t%% be assessed in the context of the relevant events%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In his oral closing submissions%%lst%% Mr Sumption identified the third proposition as the most important ]f[ Seven%%sqt%%s purpose case%%per%% 
15%%per%%4 A Strategy in 1998? 
2503 Seven%%sqt%%s starting point is that News%%lst%% by mid%%dsh%%1998%%lst%% had decided on a strategy of harming C7 %%cmp_b%% C7 posed a threat to News%%sqt%% goal of making Fox Sports the dominant supplier of Australian premium sports channels%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It needs to be borne in mind that there is nothing inherently wrong with the objective of becoming a dominant supplier of a product ]v[ service%%lst%% provided that attaining that objective does ]n[ require the use of anti%%dsh%%competitive means ]v[ conduct in contravention of the TP Act %%per%%]$~ 
~$[In order to assess the cogency of Seven%%sqt%%s contention that News had formulated an anti%%dsh%%competitive strategy it is necessary to place the events of mid%%dsh%%1998 in context%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Thus News%%sqt%% interest in the rights pre%%dsh%%dated C7%%sqt%%s entry into the business of supplying channels with sporting content%%per%%]$~ 
~$[This arrangement continued until 2002 %%cmp_b%% the dispute among the Foxtel partners prevented a long%%dsh%%term arrangement ]f[ the supply of Fox Sports to Foxtel being finalised%%per%%]$~ 
~$[After the liquidation%%lst%% production of the SportsVision channels moved to Seven%%sqt%%s sports channels%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The negotiations were frustrated by Telstra%%sqt%%s opposition to the proposed arrangement%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Telstra was motivated by its concern about the impact on Foxtel of supplying Fox Sports content to Optus%%lst%% a competitor of Foxtel%%per%% 
15%%per%%4%%per%%2 Mr Macourt ]^[ the Financial Models 
2505 Mr Macourt was the person at News responsible ]f[ the negotiations between Fox Sports ]^[ the pay television platforms%%lst%% although he consulted with Mr Lachlan Murdoch (to whom he reported) ]^[ Mr Philip (who reported to him)%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Macourt was closely questioned by Mr Sumption about the financial models prepared by Mr Parker under his direction in May ]^[ June 1998%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The cross%%dsh%%examination confirmed that the models were prepared on two principal alternative hypotheses%%cln%% that Fox Sports would be supplied exclusively to Foxtel ]^[ Austar%%lst%% ]v[ that Fox Sports would be supplied non%%dsh%%exclusively to all three retail pay television platforms%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The modelling showed that the second alternative was likely to be very much more profitable %%cmp_ta%% the first%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The modelling also incorporated different assumptions as to the rate of inflation of sporting rights costs%%lst%% depending on whether there was an alternative sports programmer%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Seven maintains that the modelling shows that News had a strategy ]f[ establishing Fox Sports as a monopoly supplier of sports programming%%per%% 
2506 Seven also points to the fact that in 1997 Optus ]^[ News had worked towards a single content company to supply all pay television platforms%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In addition%%lst%% it relies on clauses inserted into the June 1998 proposals ]f[ the non%%dsh%%exclusive supply of Fox Sports to Foxtel ]^[ Optus%%lst%% that would have prevented the retail platforms from incorporating programming ]n[ supplied by Fox Sports%%lst%% with limited exceptions such as ESPN ]^[ AFL programming%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Another proposed clause would have required Optus ]^[ Foxtel to provide non%%dsh%%exclusive pay television rights to Fox Sports ]f[ all AFL programming on the same terms as it was supplied to Optus ]^[ Foxtel%%per%% 
2507 I am ]n[ persuaded that this ]^[ the other material relied on by Seven establish that in 1998 News ]v[ Mr Macourt had embarked on a strategy of destroying C7 as a means of establishing the dominance of Fox Sports%%per%%]$~ 
~$[I leave to one side the fact that %%cmp_if%% there was any such strategy it plainly did ]n[ succeed%%lst%% since C7 secured a long%%dsh%%term supply agreement with Optus on 30 June 1998%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It is%%lst%% however%%lst%% important to bear in mind that in 1998 the pay television industry was ]n[ only new in Australia%%lst%% ]b[ in a considerable state of flux%%per%% 
2508 Following the demise ]v[ impending demise of Australis ]^[ SportsVision%%lst%% Fox Sports was seeking to supply all three pay television platforms%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Seven contemplated that it might achieve the same result through its new sports channel (at least ]f[ ]s[ long as it retained the AFL pay television rights)%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Fox Sports%%sqt%% objectives were frustrated by Telstra%%sqt%%s opposition to any content supply arrangement between Fox Sports ]^[ Optus%%per%%]$~ 
~$[However%%lst%% News%%sqt%% conduct%%lst%% in my view%%lst%% did ]n[ go beyond the deliberate%%lst%% ruthless ]^[ aggressive behaviour that is characteristic of competition%%lst%% as distinct from conduct which had the objective of destroying C7%%per%% 
2509 Mr Macourt frankly acknowledged that%%lst%% in 1998 ]^[ later%%lst%% he thought that Fox Sports would be better off financially without competition from C7 ]^[ that he would have preferred it %%cmp_if%% C7 had gone out of business%%per%%]$~ 
~$[I also think it clear enough %%dsh%%%%dsh%%%%dsh%% indeed News does ]n[ deny %%dsh%%%%dsh%%%%dsh%% that News was concerned in 1998 about possible inflation in the costs of acquiring sports rights%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Macourt denied%%lst%% however%%lst%% that his preference ]f[ the disappearance of a competitor (hardly a unique hope among business people) was a factor in News%%sqt%% strategy ]f[ the pay television business between 1998 ]^[ 2002%%per%% 
2510 If attention is focussed on 1998%%lst%% I see no conflict between Mr Macourt%%sqt%%s acknowledged preference that C7 should go out of business ]^[ his assertion that News%%sqt%% commercial strategy was motivated by a determination to maximise Fox Sports%%sqt%% position in the market by legitimate commercial means%%lst%% rather %%cmp_ta%% a determination to kill C7%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Macourt explained the assumptions in the financial modelling on the basis that%%lst%% at the time%%lst%% there were only two relevant hypotheses%%cln%% either there would be competition ]f[ sports rights ]v[ there would not%%per%%]$~ 
~$[If the latter%%lst%% he considered at the time that it was reasonable to expect a lower rate of inflation in the cost of sports rights%%per%% 
2511 The evidence suggests that %%cmp_if%% Fox Sports had succeeded in its efforts to supply content to Optus%%lst%% the latter may ]n[ have agreed to take C7%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Keely of Optus%%lst%% ]f[ example%%lst%% gave evidence that in June 1998 he regarded C7%%sqt%%s (potential) sports programming as inferior to that of Fox Sports ]^[ that he would have preferred to take Fox Sports%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Gammell said that %%cmp_if%% he had ]n[ been able to secure an MSG from Optus%%lst%% he would ]n[ have recommended that Seven proceed with the C7 business%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Thus a %%sqt%% dominant %%sqt%% position ]f[ Fox Sports as a supplier of high quality premium sports content%%lst%% at least in the short term%%lst%% was by no means out of the question%%per%% 
2512 Mr Macourt rejected the proposition that %%cmp_if%% Fox Sports managed to supply all three platforms a competitor would be unable to create a rival sports channel%%per%%]$~ 
~$[His evidence was that%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%basically %%cmp_if%% you are prepared to go ]^[ buy sports rights that are attractive to Australian consumers%%lst%% it%%sqt%%s likely that you are going to be in a strong negotiating position to compete%%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[That evidence seems to me to be plausible%%lst%% ]n[ least %%cmp_b%%%%lst%% as I have discussed in relation to market issues%%lst%% sports rights (including premium sports rights) become available from time to time to anyone who cares to bid ]f[ them%%per%% 
2513 The plausibility of Mr Macourt%%sqt%%s denial that his objective was to kill C7 is enhanced by his opposition%%lst%% expressed at the Foxtel Management board meeting of 8 July 1999%%lst%% to the direct acquisition by Foxtel of the AFL pay television rights%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It would be very curious indeed%%lst%% had Mr Macourt been party to a plan designed to destroy C7%%lst%% that he would have opposed a necessary (but ]n[ sufficient) step towards achieving the desired objective%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Seven seeks to discount the significance of Mr Macourt%%sqt%%s opposition at this stage %%cmp_b%% (as he said in his evidence) it was based on his belief that Foxtel was unlikely to succeed in any bid%%per%%]$~ 
~$[But %%cmp_if%% Mr Macourt was committed to the objective%%lst%% as Seven insists%%lst%% it is hardly likely that he would have been deterred at the outset by the practical difficulties facing Foxtel in acquiring the AFL pay television rights%%per%% 
2514 There is no doubt that News prepared financial models on the assumption%%lst%% among others%%lst%% that there might be only one supplier of Australian premium sports content%%per%%]$~ 
~$[But this was a distinct possibility%%lst%% at least until the execution of the C7%%dsh%%Optus CSA%%lst%% without News engaging in any anti%%dsh%%competitive behaviour%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Prior to the execution of the C7%%dsh%%Optus CSA%%lst%% C7%%sqt%%s position as a supplier of premium sports content was uncertain%%per%% 
2515 As Seven points out%%lst%% the letter of 23 July 1998 from Mr Macourt to Mr Moriarty of Telstra attached models showing the same assumptions as to the inflation of sports rights costs as the earlier models%%per%%]$~ 
~$[By this time%%lst%% C7 ]^[ Optus had entered into the C7%%dsh%%Optus CSA%%lst%% a fact referred to in the letter%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Thus it was unlikely that Fox Sports could have assumed that in the future there would be no competition ]f[ sports rights from other channel suppliers (leaving aside free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air operators)%%per%% 
2516 I do not%%lst%% however%%lst%% interpret the models ]v[ the letter as indicating that the C7%%dsh%%Optus CSA had stimulated News to develop ]v[ refine a strategy of acquiring the AFL pay television rights in order to destroy C7%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The most likely explanation ]f[ the models incorporating different rates of sports rights inflation depending on the existence ]v[ absence of competition is that this approach had been adopted in the earlier models%%per%%]$~ 
~$[I do ]n[ think that Mr Macourt intended the letter to convey that News was planning to acquire the AFL pay television rights in order to remove C7 as a competitor%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The letter uses the aggressive language of competition ]^[ talks of %%sqt%% several important rights %%sqt%% becoming available%%lst%% ]n[ merely the AFL pay television rights%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Moreover%%lst%% it would have been extraordinarily foolish of Mr Macourt to propose to Mr Moriaty%%lst%% at a time when News ]^[ Telstra were in conflict%%lst%% an anti%%dsh%%competitive strategy specifically designed to remove a competitor%%per%%]$~ 
~$[I do ]n[ assess Mr Macourt as likely to have acted ]s[ foolishly%%per%% 
2517 I should add that Mr Macourt%%sqt%%s evidence satisfies me that he could ]n[ recall the details of particular assumptions ]v[ why they had been adopted in the models (including an assumption in one model that the AFL pay television rights could be acquired ]f[ what Mr Macourt%%lst%% in the witness box%%lst%% regarded as a plainly unrealistically low price)%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The absence of Mr Parker from the witness box%%lst%% in my opinion%%lst%% carries the matter no further%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Parker was an accountant whose role was to prepare models based on assumptions supplied to him by Mr Macourt ]^[ others%%per%%]$~ 
~$[There is no reason to think that Mr Parker would have been able to shed further light on the matters upon which Mr Macourt%%sqt%%s recollection was imperfect%%per%% 
15%%per%%4%%per%%3 Four Further Matters 
2518 Four other matters (among many) were emphasised by Seven in its submissions%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The first was the drafting of the clauses to which I have referred%%per%%]$~ 
~$[This was the work of Mr Philip%%per%%]$~ 
~$[As it happened%%lst%% Telstra made it clear that the provision requiring Fox Sports to approve sporting content on Foxtel was unacceptable and%%lst%% of course%%lst%% no agreement was entered into between Fox Sports ]^[ Optus%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Clearly enough the provision giving Fox Sports the right to approve content was intended by Mr Philip%%lst%% %%cmp_if%% accepted by Foxtel ]^[ Optus%%lst%% to prevent C7 being taken on those platforms without the approval of Fox Sports%%per%% 
2519 Mr Macourt said that he saw the provision as applicable to content supplied by all sports providers over the term of the agreement (not just C7) ]^[ as an attempt to protect Fox Sports%%lst%% by making it a gate%%dsh%%keeper of sports programming ]f[ Foxtel%%per%%]$~ 
~$[I accept that that was his understanding%%lst%% although he appreciated that the only channel supplier against whom the provision would be likely to operate in 1998 was C7%%per%%]$~ 
~$[There may have been issues about the lawfulness of the clause drafted by Mr Philip (issues have been raised in relation to equivalent provisions in the present proceedings)%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Nonetheless%%lst%% I do ]n[ think that it%%lst%% either alone ]v[ in combination with other matters relied on by Seven%%lst%% justifies reaching a conclusion%%lst%% contrary to Mr Macourt%%sqt%%s evidence%%lst%% that News had decided in 1998 on a strategy of killing C7 in order to achieve market dominance ]f[ Fox Sports%%per%% 
2520 The second matter is Mr Macourt%%sqt%%s response to questions concerning his rejection of Seven%%sqt%%s proposal ]f[ the supply of C7 to Foxtel%%lst%% made on 7 June 1998 ([598])%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Clearly%%lst%% price was his major (and justifiable) concern%%per%%]$~ 
~$[However%%lst%% Mr Macourt said in evidence that one reason he rejected the offer was %%cmp_b%% he did ]n[ want Foxtel to carry a channel from a competitor (by which he meant Seven%%lst%% ]n[ its sports channel)%%per%%]$~ 
~$[I accept the qualification Mr Macourt put%%lst%% namely that it would have been difficult to reject the channel %%cmp_if%% the price was %%sqt%% demonstrably good %%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The qualification is consistent with Mr Macourt%%sqt%%s evidence that he was conscious that%%lst%% as a director of Foxtel Management%%lst%% his duty was to make decisions in the interests of the Foxtel Partnership%%lst%% ]n[ simply to act in News%%sqt%% ]v[ Fox Sports%%sqt%% interests regardless of the consequences ]f[ Foxtel%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It follows from this evidence (which I accept represented his understanding of his obligations) that Mr Macourt did ]n[ reject the proposal simply %%cmp_b%% he determined that Foxtel should never take C7%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Further%%lst%% a buyer%%sqt%%s distaste ]f[ assisting a perceived competitor by declining to take its branded product%%lst%% whatever issues that may raise in competition law%%lst%% is ]n[ the same as deciding to implement a strategy of destroying the competitor%%per%% 
2521 The third matter arises out of the negotiations between News ]^[ Austar preceding the Fox Sports%%dsh%%Austar CSA of 3 September 1998%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In the course of the negotiations%%lst%% Austar complained in a letter to Optus (which was entitled to sub%%dsh%%license C7 to Austar) that it was being forced to choose between C7 ]^[ Fox Sports%%per%%]$~ 
~$[As I follow Seven%%sqt%%s submission%%lst%% it argues that the Austar prize gave News a further incentive to eliminate C7%%per%% 
2522 The Fox Sports%%dsh%%Austar CSA was to continue until 2006%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It is somewhat difficult to understand how the prospect of renegotiating a contract that was ]n[ due to expire until 2006 could have provided a powerful incentive ]f[ News to eliminate C7 in 1998%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In any event%%lst%% Austar decided to acquire both Fox Sports (on basic) ]^[ C7/ESPN (on a tier)%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Despite Austar%%sqt%%s protestations%%lst%% it did ]n[ have to select one channel to the exclusion of the other%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Moreover%%lst%% the contemporary documentation relied on by Seven%%lst%% such as the letter from Messrs Macourt ]^[ Philip to Mr Rupert Murdoch of 21 October 1998%%lst%% is couched in the language of competition%%lst%% ]n[ that of exterminating a competitor%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It is true%%lst%% as Seven points out%%lst%% that in the lead%%dsh%%up to the Fox Sports%%dsh%%Austar CSA%%lst%% News refused to permit Austar to compile NRL coverage on any channel of its choosing%%per%%]$~ 
~$[But there were commercially justifiable reasons ]f[ this stance%%per%% 
2523 The fourth matter is Seven%%sqt%%s claim that the pricing dispute between News ]^[ Telstra concerning the supply of Fox Sports to Foxtel was linked to News%%sqt%% objective of killing C7%%per%%]$~ 
~$[As I follow Seven%%sqt%%s argument%%lst%% it is that News prevented Fox Sports ]^[ C7 from competing against each other ]f[ the supply of content to Foxtel%%lst%% with the objective of destroying C7%%per%%]$~ 
~$[This was designed to leave Fox Sports in a dominant position in the market and%%lst%% presumably%%lst%% improve its chances of benefiting from the transfer pricing (that is%%lst%% the diversion of revenue from Foxtel to Fox Sports) which Seven says was incorporated into the terms of the content supply arrangements between Fox Sports ]^[ Foxtel%%per%% 
2524 This argument would have force %%cmp_if%% the pricing dispute between News ]^[ Telstra (later involving PBL) was a subterfuge%%lst%% designed to mask a plan to drive C7 from the marketplace%%per%%]$~ 
~$[However%%lst%% there can be little doubt that the dispute was genuine ]^[ vigorous%%lst%% %%cmp_if%% ]n[ bitter%%per%%]$~ 
~$[News wanted Fox Sports to supply Foxtel at a price substantially higher %%cmp_ta%% Telstra thought was reasonable ]v[ appropriate%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It is quite possible that News%%sqt%% insistence on the higher price was %%cmp_b%% it preferred Fox Sports to benefit from its content supply arrangements with Foxtel%%lst%% %%cmp_if%% necessary at the expense of Foxtel%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In any event%%lst%% the part that C7 played in the dispute was essentially to be adopted by Telstra as a bargaining chip in its efforts to force down the price paid by Foxtel ]f[ the Fox Sports channels%%per%% 
2525 Mr Macourt agreed that he had adamantly opposed Foxtel taking C7 until the dispute with Telstra was resolved%%per%%]$~ 
~$[He was asked by me why he regarded resolution of the dispute as a precondition to Foxtel taking C7%%per%%]$~ 
~$[His answer was as follows%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%Our relationship with Telstra I think through this period was still very poor%%lst%% ]^[ I was still concerned that Telstra %%dsh%%%%dsh%%%%dsh%% once having secured a sports service ]f[ the platform %%dsh%%%%dsh%%%%dsh%% would %%cmp_t%% use the opportunity to take legal action to have FoxSports [sic] removed from the service with the allegations they made about us ]n[ complying with our contractual arrangements with them%%lst%% which we disputed ]b[ you can always lose a court case%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Very true%%lst%% yes? 
%%dsh%%%%dsh%%%%dsh%% So that without a fall%%dsh%%back sports program%%lst%% I didn%%sqt%%t think it was likely that Telstra would pursue that course%%per%%]$~ 
~$[But with a fall back I thought there was reasonable probability they would%%sqt%%%%per%% 
2526 I accept Mr Macourt%%sqt%%s evidence as to his motivation%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It is consistent with the terms of the letter he wrote to Mr Rizzo of Telstra on 30 July 1999 ([747]%%dsh%%[748])%%lst%% in which he complained of Telstra%%sqt%%s apparent desire %%sqt%% ]f[ some inexplicable reason %%sqt%% to strip Foxtel of the Fox Sports channels ]^[ replace them with a sports channel supplied by a free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air operator%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Moreover%%lst%% by early 1999 Telstra was indeed contemplating legal action%%per%%]$~ 
~$[A Telstra Pay Television Sub%%dsh%%Committee information paper prepared in January 1999 recorded the view that News had breached its good faith obligations by seeking to benefit its own financial interests to the detriment of Foxtel (by seeking to have Foxtel pay an excessive amount ]f[ Fox Sports)%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The paper recommended that legal action be considered%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Dr Switkowski confirmed that legal action was actively under consideration at this time%%per%%]$~ 
~$[I am ]n[ satisfied that News%%sqt%% position%%lst%% to the effect that Foxtel should ]n[ take C7 until resolution of the Fox Sports pricing issue%%lst%% had anything to do with the asserted objective of killing C7%%lst%% whether as a means of securing market dominance ]f[ Fox Sports ]v[ otherwise%%per%% 
15%%per%%4%%per%%4 Findings 
2527 For these reasons%%lst%% I do ]n[ accept Seven%%sqt%%s contention that by mid%%dsh%%1998%%lst%% ]v[ indeed by later that year%%lst%% News had settled on a strategy of destroying Seven%%sqt%%s sports channel whether as a means of securing market dominance ]f[ Fox Sports ]v[ otherwise%%per%%]$~ 
~$[While perhaps some of News%%sqt%% tactics conceivably could have attracted scrutiny under the TP Act %%lst%% I do ]n[ think that Mr Macourt%%lst%% as the decision%%dsh%%maker ]f[ News%%lst%% had the objective attributed to him by Seven%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Nor am I satisfied that Mr Philip had that objective%%per%% 
2528 I should add that PBL did ]n[ acquire its interests in Foxtel ]v[ Fox Sports until December 1998 (although it had exercised its option in relation to Foxtel in October 1998)%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Thus in mid%%dsh%%1998%%lst%% when the modelling took place within Foxtel ]^[ Fox Sports negotiated with Optus%%lst%% PBL had no involvement in either Foxtel ]v[ Fox Sports%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It %%cmp_tf%% was hardly likely to have been party to any objective of killing C7 at this time%%per%%

15%%per%%5%%per%%1 Mr Blomfield%%sqt%%s Comments 
2529 Seven relies on the two internal Telstra emails%%lst%% sent by Mr Brenton Willis to Mr Fogarty in December 2000%%per%%]$~ 
~$[These referred to comments made by Mr Blomfield in conversations in late October ]v[ early November 2000%%lst%% that there was a wider objective of killing C7%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Telstra%%sqt%%s answers to interrogatories%%lst%% recording Mr Blomfield%%sqt%%s comments%%lst%% were admitted into evidence only against Telstra%%per%%]$~ 
~$[However%%lst%% the emails are evidence that Mr Blomfield made the comments attributed to him in conversations with Mr Fogarty of Telstra%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In the absence of Mr Blomfield ]^[ Mr Fogarty from the witness box%%lst%% I accept that the statements to the effect recorded in the emails were made by Mr Blomfield to Mr Fogarty%%lst%% although due allowance must be made ]f[ the lapse of time between the conversations ]^[ the sending of the emails more %%cmp_ta%% a month later%%per%% 
(I appreciate that neither Mr Blomfield nor Mr Fogarty can be regarded as within PBL%%sqt%%s camp%%lst%% ]b[ the emails were admitted into evidence ]f[ all purposes%%per%% 
) 
2530 Mr Blomfield was an officer of News%%lst%% the CEO of Foxtel Management ]^[ a non%%dsh%%voting member of the Foxtel Management board%%per%%]$~ 
~$[What is ]n[ clear from the evidence is the context in which Mr Blomfield made his remarks to Mr Fogarty ]^[ what they were intended to convey%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In particular%%lst%% it is ]n[ clear whether Mr Blomfield was expressing his own view%%lst%% reporting someone %%cmp_e%%%%sqt%%s view%%lst%% recording Seven%%sqt%%s position ]v[ even repeating media speculation%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Nor is it clear in what sense he was using the expression %%sqt%% killing C7 %%sqt%%%%per%% 
15%%per%%5%%per%%2 Usage of %%sqt%% Kill C7 %%sqt%% 
2531 Mr Stokes%%sqt%% position%%lst%% at first%%lst%% was that he had never heard anybody use the expression %%sqt%% kill C7 %%sqt%% ]v[ words to that effect%%per%%]$~ 
~$[If Mr Blomfield%%sqt%%s use of the expression was unique%%lst%% ]v[ nearly so%%lst%% his remarks might have particular significance%%per%% 
2532 Mr Stokes%%sqt%% evidence was not%%lst%% however%%lst%% correct%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Stokes himself told the ACCC in November 1999 that should Foxtel acquire the AFL pay television rights%%lst%% it would kill C7%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Moreover%%lst%% Mr Stokes agreed in evidence that the phrase had been used as the equivalent of losing the AFL broadcasting rights%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Gammell used the expression in his conversation with Mr Falloon on 4 November 1999 and%%lst%% indeed%%lst%% claimed that he had coined the expression%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Gammell agreed that he had subsequently used the expression ]^[ that it had been employed within Seven to describe what were asserted to be the consequences of Seven losing the AFL pay television rights%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Gammell also thought that Mr Stokes %%sqt%% may well have %%sqt%% used the expression from time to time%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Clearly Seven%%sqt%%s senior executives were anxious%%lst%% in their dealings with the ACCC ]^[ others%%lst%% to link the loss of the AFL pay television rights to drastic consequences ]f[ C7%%sqt%%s business%%per%% 
2533 The point is reinforced by the evidence of Mr Wise%%per%%]$~ 
~$[He used the phrase %%sqt%% killing C7 %%sqt%% in an email to Mr Stokes of 8 November 2000%%lst%% by which he said he meant%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%Putting in a bid %%per%%%%per%%%%per%% the only purpose of [which] was to ensure that C7 didn%%sqt%%t have AFL rights%%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Wise agreed that the expression had been used within C7 ]f[ some time and%%lst%% although he could ]n[ recall Mr Stokes ]v[ Mr Gammell using it%%lst%% he thought that others within C7%%lst%% such as Mr Francis ]^[ Mr Aspinall%%lst%% had%%per%% 
2534 Mr Wise also recalled that the expression had been used in the newspapers%%per%%]$~ 
~$[His recollection was accurate%%per%%]$~ 
~$[For example%%lst%% an article in the Australian Financial Review of 14 November 2000%%lst%% published after the journalist concerned had spoken to Mr Francis the previous day%%lst%% said that %%cln%% 
%%sqt%%If Stokes were to lose the rights%%lst%% it would%%lst%% of course%%lst%% kill his pay%%dsh%%television sport programmer C7%%sqt%%%%per%% 
2535 Mr Brenton Willis%%lst%% the author of the two Telstra emails to Mr Fogarty%%lst%% had seen that article before sending the emails%%per%%]$~ 
~$[A number of other newspaper articles published at about this time referred to News%%sqt%% bid ]f[ the pay television rights (as well as the free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air television rights) as being likely to %%sqt%% blow up %%sqt%%%%lst%% %%sqt%% wipe out %%sqt%% ]v[ result in the death of C7%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The probabilities are that all the authors of these articles were briefed by Seven in advance of publication ]^[ that the briefings included reference to the dire consequences ]f[ C7 of the loss of the AFL pay television rights%%per%% 
15%%per%%5%%per%%3 Significance of the Comments 
2536 Neither of Mr Willis%%sqt%% emails specified when Mr Blomfield made his cryptic comments%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The answers to interrogatories (admissible only against Telstra) indicate that the conversations occurred in late October ]v[ early November 2000%%per%%]$~ 
~$[If this is correct%%lst%% the conversations pre%%dsh%%dated the newspaper articles to which I have referred%%per%%]$~ 
~$[On the other hand%%lst%% there was a gap%%lst%% apparently of over a month%%lst%% between the conversations ]^[ the emails%%per%%]$~ 
~$[During this period%%lst%% Mr Willis had seen the newspaper commentary ]^[ this may well have affected his recollection%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Moreover%%lst%% the expression %%sqt%% killing C7 %%sqt%%%%lst%% by late October ]v[ early November 2000%%lst%% had gained wide currency%%lst%% in no small measure %%cmp_b%% Seven%%sqt%%s senior executives had used it in an attempt to link the potential loss of the AFL pay television rights to drastic consequences ]f[ C7%%sqt%%s business%%per%% 
2537 In assessing the significance of Mr Blomfield%%sqt%%s comments%%lst%% it is necessary to take into account that the Foxtel parties did ]n[ call him as a witness%%per%%]$~ 
~$[As Seven points out%%lst%% although Mr Blomfield%%sqt%%s employment with News was terminated on 18 December 2001%%lst%% apparently in circumstances involving dissatisfaction with his performance%%lst%% he signed confidentiality undertakings in his employment contract ]^[ in a deed of release of 5 April 2002%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In the absence of those undertakings%%lst%% there would have been no impediment to Seven seeking to interview Mr Blomfield ]f[ the purposes of obtaining a statement ]f[ use in these proceedings%%per%%]$~ 
~$[However%%lst%% Seven submits that the undertakings prevented Mr Blomfield from divulging any confidential information to Seven%%sqt%%s solicitors%%lst%% even ]f[ the purposes of taking a statement ]f[ use in the proceedings%%cln%% see the very carefully reasoned decision of Campbell J in AG Australia Holdings Ltd v Burton [2002] NSWSC 170 %%scn%% (2002) 58 NSWLR 464%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Moreover%%lst%% it appears that News%%sqt%% solicitors met with Mr Blomfield in connection with this case%%lst%% ]b[ did ]n[ call him as a witness%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Thus it appears that News had the opportunity to obtain a statement from Mr Blomfield ]y[ did ]n[ seek to adduce evidence from him%%per%% 
2538 News submits that Mr Blomfield should ]n[ be regarded as in its camp %%cmp_b%% of the circumstances in which his employment was terminated ]^[ %%cmp_b%% in recent years he has had no business connection with News%%per%%]$~ 
~$[News also points out that there is evidence that Seven%%sqt%%s solicitors communicated with Mr Blomfield over a period of several months%%lst%% apparently in connection with this case%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The content of those communications has ]n[ been revealed %%cmp_b%% Seven has claimed client legal privilege over the communications%%per%% 
2539 I cannot draw inferences adverse to Seven from its claim to privilege in respect of the communications between its solicitors ]^[ Mr Blomfield%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Furthermore%%lst%% I would ]n[ readily attribute any impropriety to Seven%%sqt%%s solicitors%%per%%]$~ 
~$[This point is relevant %%cmp_b%% Seven%%sqt%%s submissions plainly imply that its solicitors were unable to interview Mr Blomfield %%cmp_b%% of the constraints imposed by the confidentiality provisions in his contracts%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In my view%%lst%% it would have been less %%cmp_ta%% proper ]f[ Seven%%sqt%%s solicitors to be party to such submissions %%cmp_if%% they had indeed interviewed Mr Blomfield with a view to his giving evidence in this case%%per%% 
2540 In the circumstances I have outlined%%lst%% I think it is appropriate%%lst%% in the absence of an explanation by News as to why it did ]n[ call Mr Blomfield%%lst%% to regard him as within News%%sqt%% camp ]^[ available to be called as a witness%%per%%]$~ 
~$[News%%sqt%% failure to call Mr Blomfield %%cmp_tf%% lends support to an inference that his comments to Mr Fogarty in late October ]v[ early November 2000 reflected his view that News ]v[ Foxtel had the objective of killing C7 when seeking to acquire the AFL pay television rights%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Furthermore%%lst%% I think it appropriate to take into account that News%%sqt%% assiduous policy of deleting electronic communications deprived Seven of the opportunity to examine whether News%%sqt%% internal communications shed light on what Mr Blomfield was intending to convey to Mr Fogarty although%%lst%% as I have already noted%%lst%% that policy did ]n[ apply to communications within Foxtel%%per%% 
2541 Nevertheless%%lst%% after giving due weight to the availability of inferences adverse to News%%lst%% in my opinion the totality of the circumstances I have identified makes Mr Blomfield%%sqt%%s comments of limited assistance in determining whether News (or%%lst%% a fortiori %%lst%% PBL) had the purpose attributed to it by Seven%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Insofar as Seven interprets Mr Blomfield as having asserted that Foxtel%%sqt%%s bid (through the Foxtel Put) ]f[ the AFL pay television rights was designed to destroy C7%%lst%% the contemporaneous Foxtel documentation does ]n[ directly support that interpretation%%per%% 
(By %%sqt%% directly %%sqt%%%%lst%% I mean that%%lst%% apart from the otherwise equivocal material from which Seven seeks to draw inferences%%lst%% no emails ]v[ other internal Foxtel communications suggest that Foxtel ]v[ News had the intention of destroying C7%%per%%]$~ 
~$[I shall refer in more detail to that material later%%per%% 
) 
2542 Further%%lst%% Seven%%sqt%%s interpretation implies that Mr Blomfield was responsible ]f[ putting his name to documents%%lst%% such as his letter of 2 November 2000 to Mr Willis ]^[ his paper of 6 December 2000 recommending that directors of Foxtel Management authorise execution of the Foxtel Put at a fee of $30 million per annum%%lst%% knowing full well that his conduct formed an integral part of an anti%%dsh%%competitive strategy designed to kill C7%%per%%]$~ 
~$[On Seven%%sqt%%s case%%lst%% Mr Blomfield knew all this ]y[ made no protest%%scn%% more %%cmp_ta%% this%%lst%% he helped effectuate the plan%%per%%]$~ 
~$[This is also ]n[ a conclusion to be reached lightly%%lst%% even taking account of the inferences available due to Mr Blomfield%%sqt%%s absence from the witness box%%per%% 
2543 I leave to one side ]f[ the moment the evidence of Mr Macourt ]^[ Mr Philip%%lst%% both of whom denied having the purpose ]v[ objective of killing C7 in relation to the acquisition of the AFL pay television rights%%per%%]$~ 
~$[However%%lst%% Mr Mockridge%%lst%% who was CEO of Foxtel Management until February 2000%%lst%% denied that he had ever been told by representatives of News ]v[ PBL that they had the objective of killing C7%%sqt%%s business%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Nor did he have an expectation himself that the loss of the AFL pay television rights would kill C7%%sqt%%s business%%per%%]$~ 
~$[While Mr Mockridge had ceased to be CEO of Foxtel nine months before Mr Blomfield made his comments%%lst%% it would be extremely odd%%lst%% given the way Seven presents its case%%lst%% %%cmp_if%% Mr Mockridge was unaware that the objective of the Foxtel partners was to kill C7 %%cmp_if%% that had been their objective all along%%per%%]$~ 
~$[I accept Mr Mockridge%%sqt%%s evidence%%per%% 
2544 The fact is that at the time Mr Blomfield made his comments to Mr Fogarty ]^[ others at Telstra%%lst%% the expression %%sqt%% killing C7 %%sqt%% was ]n[ only in widespread use%%lst%% ]b[ the expression had been promoted by Seven (even though the particular newspaper articles to which I have referred had ]n[ ]y[ appeared)%%per%%]$~

15%%per%%6 Overbidding ]f[ the AFL Pay Television Rights? 
15%%per%%6%%per%%1 Seven%%sqt%%s Contention 
2545 Seven%%sqt%%s contention is that Foxtel entered into the Foxtel Put notwithstanding that its executives thought the acquisition of the AFL pay television rights would be loss%%dsh%%making over the term of the agreement%%per%%]$~ 
~$[According to Seven%%lst%% the financial models were manipulated to present an optimistic picture ]f[ Telstra%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Despite poorer quality pay television rights%%lst%% notably through a reduction in the number of live games from four to three ]^[ the introduction of the flip%%dsh%%flop ([971]ff)%%lst%% the models were amended to improve the predicted performance of the AFL channel%%per%% 
2546 Seven submits in relation to the flip%%dsh%%flop that%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%The impact on the attractiveness of the product in Brisbane%%lst%% Sydney%%lst%% Adelaide ]^[ Perth of the inability to ever show a local team match exclusively live is ]s[ blindingly obvious that it is ]n[ credible that Foxtel ]^[ News were unaware that this was a significant disadvantage with the proposal%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The evidence of Mr Frykberg supports a finding that Foxtel ]^[ News were well aware of the significant disadvantage%%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Seven invites me to find that News ]^[ Foxtel never genuinely believed that a direct acquisition of the AFL pay television rights was preferable to an acquisition through C7%%per%%]$~ 
~$[At best%%lst%% they were recklessly indifferent to whether the News proposal was likely to be profitable ]f[ Foxtel%%per%% 
2547 When Mr Sumption opened Seven%%sqt%%s case%%lst%% he said that Foxtel%%sqt%%s indirect bid ]f[ the AFL pay television rights%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%was predatory in the sense that the price offered was loss making ]^[ known to be loss making ]^[ was far in excess of what it would have cost to buy in a channel showing those same games%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It was %%per%%%%per%%%%per%% an offer which made economic sense only on the footing that in the longer term Fox Sports would benefit by the removal of competition in the market in which it operated %%per%%%%per%%%%per%%%%sqt%% (Emphasis added%%per%% 
) 
This argument involves at least two contentions%%cln%% first%%lst%% that Foxtel%%sqt%%s acquisition of the AFL pay television rights was substantially above market price%%scn%% and%%lst%% secondly%%lst%% that by reason of the modelling%%lst%% Foxtel knew the offer was bound to be loss%%dsh%%making ]^[ thus appreciated that it was devoid of rational economic justification%%per%% 
2548 By the time Seven filed its written submissions%%lst%% its representatives doubtless realised that Mr Stokes had made certain concessions in his evidence concerning the reasonableness of the price paid by Foxtel ]f[ the AFL pay television rights%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Seven%%sqt%%s Reply Submissions address this difficulty by contending that the overbidding case %%sqt%% is a case of subjective overbidding%%lst%% ]n[ objective overbidding %%sqt%%%%per%% 
2549 The first of these submissions implies that Foxtel intended to pay%%lst%% ]^[ thought it was paying%%lst%% a supra%%dsh%%competitive price ]f[ the AFL pay television rights in order to kill C7 but%%lst%% despite its best efforts%%lst%% managed to acquire the rights ]f[ a competitive price (or at least at a price no greater %%cmp_ta%% C7 thought they were worth)%%per%%]$~

~$[This is not%%lst%% in my view%%lst%% an easy position to maintain%%per%% 
15%%per%%6%%per%%2 Five Difficulties with Seven%%sqt%%s Contention 
2550 In assessing Seven%%sqt%%s overbidding contention%%lst%% five points need to be borne in mind%%per%%]$~ 
~$[First %%lst%% Seven%%sqt%%s submissions on this point are substantially based on the assumption that in 1998 News formulated a plan to dominate pay sports rights by killing off the incipient C7%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Seven%%sqt%%s contentions about the purpose of Foxtel%%sqt%%s indirect bid%%lst%% through News%%lst%% ]f[ the AFL pay television rights in late 2000 seem to me to attempt to place square facts into round holes%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The attempt reflects the fact that Seven%%sqt%%s submissions interpret the relevant events through the prism of their starting point%%per%%]$~ 
~$[I do ]n[ accept the starting point%%per%% 
2551 Secondly %%lst%% in my opinion Seven places altogether too much significance on the financial modelling undertaken by Foxtel in late 2000%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The submissions %%dsh%%%%dsh%%%%dsh%% ]^[ indeed a good deal of the cross%%dsh%%examination %%dsh%%%%dsh%%%%dsh%% appear to have been based on an assumption that financial models are necessarily designed to predict likely financial outcomes%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The assumption is that models must be based on the most realistic predictions that will determine the profitability of a particular endeavour%%per%% 
2552 That indeed may be the objective underlying the preparation of particular financial models%%per%%]$~ 
~$[But%%lst%% as I have previously suggested%%lst%% this case demonstrates%%lst%% %%cmp_if%% the point needs demonstration%%lst%% that financial models may be prepared with other objectives in mind%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It is ]n[ necessarily to engage in %%sqt%% manipulation %%sqt%%%%lst%% much less in dishonesty%%lst%% to prepare models working backwards from a given outcome%%lst%% such as attributing a positive NPV to the exploitation of particular rights over a given period%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The point of the exercise may be to isolate the financial targets (the variables) that must be achieved in order to attain the desired outcome%%per%%]$~ 
~$[For example%%lst%% what must a pay television operator charge ]^[ what penetration rates must it achieve in order to produce a positive return ]f[ compiling ]^[ distributing a particular sports channel? 
2553 Despite Mr Philip%%sqt%%s general unreliability as a witness%%lst%% he gave what seemed to me to be reasonably frank evidence on this aspect of the case%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In his statement%%lst%% he volunteered that he had asked Mr Boyd to prepare models that showed a positive NPV ]f[ the acquisition of the AFL pay television rights at prices%%lst%% respectively%%lst%% of $25 million ]^[ $30 million per annum%%per%%]$~ 
~$[He said that he wanted the models in this form in order to convince Telstra to support Foxtel%%sqt%%s bid%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Philip agreed that he saw the acquisition of the AFL pay television rights as a strategic acquisition ]^[ that he did ]n[ necessarily expect it to be cashflow positive%%per%%]$~ 
~$[He accepted that he was nonetheless perfectly content to ask ]f[ models that showed the acquisition to be cashflow positive%%per%% 
2554 Mr Philip had no compunction about deliberately misleading Telstra%%per%%]$~ 
~$[He did exactly that in his fax of 9 December 2000 to Mr Akhurst seeking Telstra%%sqt%%s support ]f[ the Fox Sports bid%%per%%]$~ 
~$[On one view%%lst%% the preparation of the model showing a positive NPV ]f[ an acquisition of the AFL pay television rights ]f[ $30 million involved an element of deception on Mr Philip%%sqt%%s part%%lst%% since he himself did ]n[ necessarily accept that the financial outcome would be positive%%per%%]$~ 
~$[But he said in his evidence%%lst%% fairly enough in my view%%lst%% that it was a matter ]f[ Telstra to evaluate ]f[ itself the validity of the assumptions incorporated into the model%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The model prepared on Mr Philip%%sqt%%s instructions exposed the assumptions sufficiently ]f[ Telstra to make its own assessment%%per%% 
2555 As has been seen%%lst%% there were in fact sharp divisions of opinion within Telstra as to whether the assumptions were realistic%%per%%]$~ 
~$[But the senior decision%%dsh%%makers within Telstra%%lst%% including Dr Switkowski%%lst%% were ]n[ under any illusions as to what targets had to be achieved %%cmp_if%% the acquisition of the AFL pay television rights was to generate positive returns to Foxtel%%per%% 
2556 Thirdly %%lst%% as Dr Switkowski ]^[ others made clear%%lst%% in this context assumptions in financial models are essentially predictions ]v[ estimates as to future business performance ]v[ economic measures%%per%%]$~ 
~$[They cannot substitute ]f[ the exercise of judgment in decision%%dsh%%making by the responsible executives%%per%%]$~ 
~$[This may require decisions to be made ]f[ %%sqt%% strategic %%sqt%% reasons%%lst%% rather %%cmp_ta%% on the basis of financial predictions ]v[ modelling%%per%%]$~ 
~$[There is something more %%cmp_ta%% passing strange about Seven%%sqt%%s complaint about Foxtel%%sqt%%s %%sqt%% manipulation %%sqt%% of financial models to achieve a predetermined outcome%%per%%]$~ 
~$[After all%%lst%% Mr Stokes%%lst%% on his own account%%lst%% was prepared ]f[ Seven to offer hundreds of millions of dollars ]f[ the NRL pay television rights over a period of years without troubling to carry out any modelling at all%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Sumption%%sqt%%s answer is that it is worse to have a model that undermines one%%sqt%%s case %%cmp_ta%% to have no model at all%%per%%]$~ 
~$[At the very least%%lst%% however%%lst%% Seven%%sqt%%s %%sqt%% seat of the pants %%sqt%% approach (to use Mr Sumption%%sqt%%s language) suggests that very large financial decisions in this industry often involve very broad%%dsh%%brush%%lst%% even instinctive%%lst%% judgments%%lst%% in which the results of modelling play a minor part ]v[ perhaps no part at all%%per%% 
2557 Fourthly %%lst%% there is no escaping the elephant in the room%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The fact is that Mr Stokes thought that the bundle of AFL pay television rights acquired by Foxtel ]f[ $30 million per annum was a good deal%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The concessions he made%%lst%% bearing in mind that he had been prepared ]f[ C7 to pay $30 million per annum ]f[ one exclusive AFL pay television game%%lst%% cannot be explained on the ground that his belated offer to the AFL on 14 December 2000 merely reflected the value of Optus%%sqt%% MSG%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In any event%%lst%% Mr Wise%%sqt%%s confused explanation of how he came to justify Seven%%sqt%%s bid of $60 million per annum ]f[ the AFL broadcasting rights suggests that %%cmp_if%% he had undertaken an analysis on the basis of accurate information he would have been able to support a considerably higher bid%%per%% 
2558 Furthermore%%lst%% Seven%%sqt%%s bid was influenced by its misapprehension about the future course of the bidding process ]^[ its determination (until after the presentation to the AFL had concluded) that its bid should cover both the free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air ]^[ pay television rights%%per%%]$~ 
~$[As Mr Wise ]^[ Mr Stokes explained%%lst%% that strategy was originally a product of Seven%%sqt%%s desire to maximise its chances of securing the AFL broadcasting rights without the inconvenience of a competitive process (%%cmp_b%% they thought that no one %%cmp_e%% was interested in the free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air television rights)%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In substance%%lst%% the strategy backfired%%per%%]$~ 
~$[I do ]n[ accept Mr Sumption%%sqt%%s submission that Mr Stokes%%sqt%% evidence is irrelevant to the issue of Foxtel%%sqt%%s alleged overbidding ]f[ the AFL pay television rights%%per%% 
2559 Fifthly %%lst%% the uncontested evidence is that Mr Frykberg told Mr Philip in early December 2000 that a bid of up to $30 million per annum would be required to obtain the AFL pay television rights%%per%%]$~ 
~$[No suggestion was put to Mr Frykberg that he was party to ]v[ aware of any objective of killing C7%%lst%% nor that his advice might have been distorted by the prospect of his earning a success fee%%per%%]$~ 
~$[If it is accepted (as I do accept) that Mr Frykberg was ]n[ aware of any malign objective%%lst%% his advice to Mr Philip could only have been based on his assessment of what was needed to beat a likely bid ]f[ the rights by Seven%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Of course%%lst%% Mr Frykberg%%sqt%%s advice is ]n[ necessarily inconsistent with Mr Philip ]^[ Mr Macourt having the objective attributed to them by Seven%%per%%]$~ 
~$[But it tends strongly against a belief on their part that a $30 million per annum bid ]f[ the AFL pay television rights was predatory%%lst%% as distinct from a bid reasonably likely to succeed in a competitive auction ]f[ the rights%%per%% 
15%%per%%6%%per%%3 Models 
2560 Seven%%sqt%%s submissions analyse in detail the modifications to the various models undertaken within Foxtel%%per%%]$~ 
~$[News ]^[ PBL respond with equally detailed analyses of their own%%per%%]$~ 
~$[I have outlined in Chapter 8 the essential content of the models ]^[ there is no need to repeat the account here%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In my view%%lst%% the evidence is consistent with News ]^[ Foxtel acting on the perception that the acquisition of the AFL pay television rights was highly desirable in the interests of Foxtel as a retail pay television platform%%lst%% particularly as a subscription driver ]f[ the southern States%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The evidence is also consistent with them deciding to support a bid (through the Foxtel Put) that had a good chance of succeeding in a competitive auction ]f[ the AFL pay television rights%%per%% 
2561 There is no doubt that Mr Macourt ]^[ Mr Philip were extremely keen to secure the AFL pay television rights ]f[ Foxtel%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Philip was prepared to engage in forceful advocacy (and more) to achieve the result%%per%%]$~ 
~$[He was prepared to lie to Telstra to obtain its support ]f[ Fox Sports%%sqt%% bid ]f[ the NRL pay television rights%%lst%% ]b[ he seems ]n[ to have resorted to similar deception in endeavouring to persuade Telstra to support the Foxtel Put%%lst%% perhaps %%cmp_b%% he did ]n[ need to%%per%% 
2562 It is clear enough that Mr Philip%%lst%% despite his reticence to acknowledge the fact in the witness box%%lst%% appreciated that there was a risk that C7 would cease to be commercially viable %%cmp_if%% its bids ]f[ the AFL ]^[ NRL pay television rights both failed%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Philip%%lst%% like Mr Macourt%%lst%% would ]n[ have been in the least perturbed %%cmp_if%% he knew that C7 was likely to collapse as a consequence of losing the AFL pay television rights%%per%%]$~ 
~$[But a lack of concern %%dsh%%%%dsh%%%%dsh%% ]v[ even pleasure %%dsh%%%%dsh%%%%dsh%% at that outcome does ]n[ demonstrate that Mr Philip (or Mr Macourt) actively sought the destruction of C7%%lst%% particularly %%cmp_if%% there were good commercial reasons ]f[ Foxtel to seek the AFL pay television rights%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Nor does a lack of concern about C7 of itself support the contention that Foxtel offered (indirectly) a predatory price to the AFL ]f[ the pay television rights in order to bring about C7%%sqt%%s demise%%per%% 
15%%per%%6%%per%%3%%per%%1 FLIP%%dsh%%FLOP 
2563 Seven points to a number of factors that%%lst%% ]s[ it argues%%lst%% support the contention that Mr Macourt ]^[ Mr Philip must have known that the bid ]f[ the AFL pay television rights would be loss%%dsh%%making ]f[ Foxtel%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It emphasises%%lst%% in particular%%lst%% the introduction of the flip%%dsh%%flop as a development which must have had%%lst%% ]^[ have been understood to have%%lst%% a substantial negative impact on the value of the AFL pay television rights ultimately obtained by Foxtel%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Undoubtedly the flip%%dsh%%flop turned out to be disadvantageous to Foxtel%%per%%]$~ 
~$[But in my view%%lst%% in late 2000%%lst%% while the flip%%dsh%%flop was plainly seen as a negative%%lst%% neither News nor Foxtel fully appreciated the likely significance of the flip%%dsh%%flop ]f[ Foxtel%%sqt%%s future pay television operations%%per%% 
2564 Both Mr Macourt ]^[ Mr Philip said that%%lst%% although they resisted the introduction of the flip%%dsh%%flop%%lst%% they did ]n[ regard it as %%sqt%% blindingly obvious %%sqt%% (as Seven submits it was) that the flip%%dsh%%flop would have a significant adverse effect on the value of the pay television rights%%per%%]$~ 
~$[I would ]n[ accept Mr Philip%%sqt%%s assertion to this effect %%cmp_if%% it was unsupported by other evidence%%per%%]$~ 
~$[However%%lst%% Mr Frykberg%%lst%% who was more experienced in relation to AFL content %%cmp_ta%% either Mr Macourt ]v[ Mr Philip%%lst%% miscalculated the likely significance of the flip%%dsh%%flop %%cmp_b%% he underestimated the extent of the parochial allegiances of AFL fans%%per%%]$~ 
~$[At the time%%lst%% he believed that the flip%%dsh%%flop would ]n[ necessarily result in Nine ]^[ Ten broadcasting the games with greater viewer appeal%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Moreover%%lst%% he conveyed his belief to Mr Philip%%per%% 
2565 In the light of Mr Frykberg%%sqt%%s evidence%%lst%% I accept Mr Philip%%sqt%%s claim that in late 2000 he thought that the flip%%dsh%%flop would %%sqt%% potentially [work] out okay ]f[ Foxtel %%sqt%%%%lst%% even though he regarded it as an undesirable feature of the proposed arrangements%%per%%]$~ 
~$[I also accept Mr Macourt%%sqt%%s evidence that%%lst%% on the basis of his experience with the ratings of NRL games on pay television%%lst%% he did ]n[ consider that the flip%%dsh%%flop would necessarily result in the broadcasting of inferior AFL games on pay television%%per%% 
2566 The miscalculations were ]n[ confined to Mr Macourt ]^[ Mr Philip%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Campbell%%lst%% who conducted modelling with Mr Boyd ]f[ Foxtel%%lst%% first learned of the flip%%dsh%%flop from Mr Frykberg on 27 October 2000%%per%%]$~ 
~$[At first%%lst%% Mr Campbell proceeded on the misconception that under the flip%%dsh%%flop%%lst%% when free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air television covered a local game in%%lst%% say%%lst%% Adelaide%%lst%% pay television would be able to show that game non%%dsh%%exclusively ]^[ would have exclusive rights to the %%sqt%% national %%sqt%% games%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Campbell %%cmp_tf%% did ]n[ see the flip%%dsh%%flop%%lst%% as he understood it%%lst%% as much of a negative%%per%%]$~ 
~$[When he was disabused of this particular misconception in late November 2000%%lst%% he thought that the flip%%dsh%%flop would have a negative impact in cities outside Melbourne%%lst%% ]b[ that Foxtel could still expect a very considerable boost in the Melbourne market%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In making this assessment he%%lst%% too%%lst%% underestimated the significance of subscribers%%sqt%% interest in local AFL games%%lst%% rather %%cmp_ta%% better %%sqt%% quality %%sqt%% games%%per%% 
15%%per%%6%%per%%3%%per%%2 PENETRATION RATES AND NPV 
2567 Seven also strongly criticised the assumptions incorporated into the models as to the increased penetration on basic that Foxtel could achieve in the southern States by reason of acquiring the AFL pay television rights%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The model that accompanied Mr Mockridge%%sqt%%s paper to the Foxtel Management board meeting of 26 October 1999 assumed an increase of 2%%per%%9 per cent%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The financial model accompanying Mr Blomfield%%sqt%%s paper of 6 December 2000 incorporated a figure of 30 per cent%%per%%]$~ 
~$[This corresponded to 163,000 additional subscribers rather %%cmp_ta%% a mere 8,000%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The increased penetration rates were critical to producing a positive NPV%%per%% 
2568 The most substantial increases in assumed penetration rates occurred in a model prepared on about 1 December 2000 by Mr Boyd%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Boyd prepared the model at Mr Blomfield%%sqt%%s request%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Blomfield told Mr Boyd that the Foxtel Management board meeting of 9 November 2000 had agreed (as it had) that the models should assume equal penetration rates in the southern ]^[ northern States%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Blomfield directed Mr Boyd to assume that equalisation would be achieved over a five year period%%per%% 
2569 Mr Boyd initially believed that the earlier models had already assumed equal penetration rates%%lst%% ]b[ he discovered that this was incorrect%%per%%]$~ 
~$[He %%cmp_t%% proceeded to implement the instruction he had received by incorporating into the model a penetration rate of 30 per cent%%lst%% to be achieved in 2006%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The model incorporated alternative rights fees of $17%%per%%5 million per annum ]^[ $25 million per annum%%per%% 
2570 The next models were prepared on 5 December 2000%%lst%% on the basis of assumed alternative rights fees of $25 million ]^[ $30 million per annum%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The first model produced a positive NPV of $13%%per%%1 million%%lst%% while the second model produced an NPV of %%dsh%%$5%%per%%8 million%%per%%]$~ 
~$[This prompted Mr Philip to ask Mr Boyd to prepare a revised model assuming rights fees of $28 million ]^[ $30 million%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The latter was to assume higher penetration rates ]f[ the southern States in the early years ]^[ was also to assume that 30 per cent penetration would be reached earlier%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Boyd complied ]^[ produced a model with a positive NPV of $2%%per%%3 million%%per%% 
2571 The parties disagree as to whether the substantial increase in penetration rates in the models pre%%dsh%%dated Mr Philip%%sqt%%s involvement in the modelling process%%per%%]$~ 
~$[News says the substantial changes in the assumed penetration rates occurred before Mr Philip%%sqt%%s involvement%%scn%% Seven says that Mr Philip instigated the major changes%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The evidence on the point is unclear%%per%%]$~ 
~$[However%%lst%% I think it more likely that Mr Philip asked Mr Blomfield on ]v[ shortly before 1 December 2000 to request Mr Boyd to prepare a model assuming equal penetration rates in southern ]^[ northern States%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Given (as I have found) that the Foxtel Management board had agreed to equalise the penetration rates on 9 November 2000%%lst%% in my view%%lst%% nothing of substance turns on the precise date of Mr Philip%%sqt%%s involvement in the modelling process%%per%% 
2572 A number of witnesses gave evidence that they thought that the assumptions about penetration rates ]^[ the feasibility of achieving the targets embodied in the final model were reasonable%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Macourt was ]n[ consulted about the model before its preparation ]^[ did ]n[ %%cmp%% it with earlier versions%%lst%% largely %%cmp_b%% he thought they lacked adequate detail%%per%%]$~ 
~$[His evidence was that he thought the assumptions contained in the model were reasonable ]^[ that the NPV%%lst%% %%cmp_if%% anything%%lst%% was conservative %%cmp_b%% no terminal value had been attributed to the AFL pay television rights%%per%% 
2573 Contrary to News%%sqt%% submissions%%lst%% I interpret Mr Macourt%%sqt%%s cross%%dsh%%examination as challenging his evidence on this point%%per%%]$~ 
~$[His evidence requires careful examination%%per%%]$~ 
~$[He was reluctant to accept that in July 1999 he had been concerned about the (%%cmp_t%%) projected cost of Foxtel acquiring the AFL pay television rights%%per%%]$~ 
~$[While that was some 17 months before Foxtel finally committed itself to a bid of $30 million per annum ]f[ the rights%%lst%% his reservations about bidding in mid%%dsh%%1999 (at a projected fee of $15 million per annum) shows that he had been troubled about the cost to Foxtel of acquiring the rights%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Moreover%%lst%% Mr Macourt%%sqt%%s analysis of the final model was cursory and%%lst%% on his own evidence%%lst%% he paid little attention to the assumptions built into the model%%per%% 
2574 There is no doubt that Mr Macourt understood that Foxtel%%sqt%%s acquisition of the AFL pay television rights would be expensive ]^[ that it would ]n[ be easy to make good the projections embodied in the model%%per%%]$~ 
~$[But I am ]n[ prepared to reject Mr Macourt%%sqt%%s denial that the reason ]v[ a substantial reason%%lst%% as he saw it%%lst%% ]f[ Foxtel being prepared to bid $30 million per annum was that %%sqt%% it made sense ]f[ News to pay a large premium to push C7 out of the market %%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[There is a substantial gap between accepting a significant risk that models may ]n[ prove to be accurate ]^[ deliberately entering a transaction known to be loss%%dsh%%making in order to drive a competitor out of the market%%per%%]$~ 
~$[That gap is more difficult to bridge when the price being offered is thought to be the amount required to succeed in a competitive auction%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Moreover%%lst%% as I have found in Chapter 8 ([1042]ff)%%lst%% Mr Macourt%%sqt%%s conversation with Mr Gammell on 4 December 2000 tends against the conclusion that his objective in supporting News%%sqt%% bid ]f[ the AFL pay television rights was to destroy C7 as a viable supplier of premium sports channels%%per%% 
2575 Mr Campbell said that he had been told by Mr Blomfield to achieve a particular result in the modelling exercise%%lst%% namely a positive NPV at a rights fee of $30 million per annum%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Nonetheless%%lst%% he said that %%cmp_if%% he did ]n[ think that the numbers were achievable%%lst%% he would have told Mr Blomfield%%per%%]$~ 
~$[He thought the assumptions were optimistic%%lst%% ]b[ ]n[ wildly so%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Furthermore%%lst%% they were supported by inquiries he made within Foxtel%%per%% 
2576 Mr Campbell was questioned as to the extent of his inquiries ]^[ the cross%%dsh%%examination showed that they were in fact superficial%%per%%]$~ 
~$[But there is no reason to doubt that Mr Campbell did make inquiries%%lst%% such as they were%%lst%% in order to test the assumptions ]^[ that the information he obtained was consistent with the assumptions incorporated into the model%%per%%]$~ 
~$[While Mr Campbell%%sqt%%s state of mind is ]n[ central to the case%%lst%% I do ]n[ think that there is a sound basis ]f[ rejecting his evidence that he thought at the time that the assumptions were within the bounds of reasonableness ]^[ were achievable%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Optimism is one thing%%scn%% belief that a venture is necessarily loss%%dsh%%making is another%%per%% 
2577 Mr Boyd said that the assumptions incorporated into the models were aggressive%%lst%% ]b[ ]n[ unreasonable%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In particular%%lst%% he thought that the accelerated rate of penetration assumed in the final model was achievable %%cmp_b%% the total number of subscribers did ]n[ increase from the earlier model%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The only change was to assume that the subscriber growth would occur over a shorter period%%per%% 
2578 Mr Philip%%sqt%%s position was ]n[ entirely consistent throughout his evidence%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In substance%%lst%% he maintained that he believed%%lst%% on the basis of conversations with Mr Macourt%%lst%% that the assumptions built into the final model were ]n[ unreasonable%%per%%]$~ 
~$[He added that he had ]n[ paid much attention to the assumptions himself%%per%%]$~ 
~$[I would ]n[ be prepared to accept Mr Philip%%sqt%%s evidence on these matters %%cmp_if%% it stood uncorroborated%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The circumstances%%lst%% however%%lst%% lend support to his claim%%per%% 
2579 Clearly enough%%lst%% Mr Philip was galvanised into action by Mr Frykberg%%sqt%%s advice that a bid of $30 million per annum would be needed to secure the AFL pay television rights%%lst%% having regard to the likely competition%%per%%]$~ 
~$[His response was to instruct Mr Boyd to prepare a $30 million model which showed a positive NPV as the outcome%%per%%]$~

~$[Accordingly%%lst%% despite Mr Philip being an unreliable witness %%dsh%%%%dsh%%%%dsh%% ]^[ indeed a witness capable of dishonesty in his dealings %%dsh%%%%dsh%%%%dsh%% I am ]n[ satisfied that he saw the bid by Foxtel as necessarily loss%%dsh%%making ]f[ it%%per%%]$~

~$[However%%lst%% during the relevant periods%%lst%% Mr Philip in fact reported to Mr Macourt on a regular basis%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Nonetheless%%lst%% Mr Philip%%sqt%%s role was ]n[ limited to providing legal advice%%per%%]$~ 
~$[As he said in evidence%%lst%% he was deeply involved in executing commercial strategies devised by News in the field of sports rights acquisition%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Furthermore%%lst%% despite his reticence on the subject%%lst%% his role included making judgments on commercial issues%%per%% 
2581 In his oral reply submissions on behalf of Seven%%lst%% Mr Sumption invited me to find that Mr Philip had the full authority of News to bid ]^[ make the relevant commercial judgments on its behalf%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Sumption accepted that Mr Macourt was senior to Mr Philip ]^[ could have overruled him%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Nonetheless%%lst%% he submitted that Mr Macourt chose to%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%delegate everything to Mr Philip%%lst%% subject to being consulted ]^[ kept informed%%lst%% ]^[ did ]n[ interfere with what Mr Philip was doing%%sqt%%%%per%% 
2582 Mr Philip took over the role of negotiating with the AFL in August 2000%%lst%% after he informed Mr Macourt that he had lost confidence in Mr Blomfield%%sqt%%s ability to successfully negotiate an agreement%%per%%]$~ 
~$[However%%lst%% he continued to consult with Mr Macourt (whose office was next%%dsh%%door to his) on a regular basis%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It is true that%%lst%% as Mr Macourt accepted%%lst%% the organisation of the put options ]^[ the acquisition of the AFL broadcasting rights by News was planned ]^[ executed by Mr Philip%%lst%% in conjunction with Mr Frykberg%%per%%]$~ 
~$[But Mr Macourt was still the senior decision%%dsh%%maker ]^[ continued to participate in the decision%%dsh%%making process%%lst%% including the decisions made at the teleconference of 13 December 2000%%per%%]$~ 
~$[There is no reason to doubt Mr Philip%%sqt%%s evidence that he ]n[ only consulted frequently with Mr Macourt on commercial issues%%lst%% ]b[ deferred to Mr Macourt%%sqt%%s experience ]^[ authority when there were differences of view%%per%%]$~ 
~$[There was no formal delegation of authority to Mr Philip ]^[ no informal abdication by Mr Macourt of his responsibilities as the senior executive (subject to the role of Mr Lachlan Murdoch)%%per%% 
2583 I should add that Mr Blomfield was engaged by News ]^[ appointed by News to be CEO of Foxtel Management%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Blomfield acted on instructions ]^[ did ]n[ determine whether News ]v[ its associated entities would become parties to the Master Agreement Provision%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Foxtel Management is ]n[ alleged to have been a party to the Master Agreement%%per%% 
2584 My overall assessment of a very large amount of material is that News%%lst%% through Mr Macourt ]^[ Mr Philip%%lst%% thought that there were good commercial reasons ]f[ Foxtel to acquire the AFL pay television rights%%per%%]$~ 
~$[A judgment was made that%%lst%% in order to have a good chance of succeeding in a competitive auction ]f[ the AFL pay television rights%%lst%% a bid of $30 million per annum would be required%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The decision to support a bid at this price did ]n[ rest simply ]v[ even primarily on the results of modelling%%lst%% ]b[ took account of other considerations%%lst%% such as the %%sqt%% strategic %%sqt%% advantages of controlling the presentation of the AFL ]^[ avoiding the perceived problems of dealing with Seven as a free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air operator in charge of the rights%%per%%]$~ 
~$[I do ]n[ regard the strategic advantages as having included the destruction of C7 as a specific objective%%lst%% although both Mr Macourt ]^[ Mr Philip would have regarded that consequence with equanimity%%lst%% %%cmp_if%% ]n[ enthusiasm%%lst%% %%cmp_if%% it came about%%per%% 
2585 The models based on a rights fee of $30 million per annum were constructed ]f[ a variety of purposes%%per%%]$~ 
~$[One was to persuade Telstra of the merits of the acquisition by presenting a positive NPV as the likely outcome of a successful bid%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Another was to expose the assumptions that would have to be made good in order to produce a positive cashflow%%per%%]$~ 
~$[A third was to provide a measure of comfort among the Foxtel partners ]f[ the bid%%per%%]$~ 
~$[All persons involved in the exercise appreciated that the assumptions were both aggressive ]^[ optimistic%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The consensus was that the targets were achievable%%lst%% ]b[ that there was a significant risk that they would ]n[ be realised within the time%%dsh%%frame spanning the period ]f[ which the rights were to be granted%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The Foxtel Put was by no means a commercially safe bet%%per%% 
2586 As events turned out%%lst%% the scepticism amply on display within Telstra proved to be well justified%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In my view%%lst%% that is ]n[ inconsistent with the News ]^[ Foxtel executives holding the more optimistic views I have identified%%per%%]$~ 
~$[As Dr Switkowski pointed out%%lst%% there were some %%sqt%% Cold War warriors %%sqt%% within Telstra who displayed a degree of %%sqt%% emotions ]^[ ferocity %%sqt%% in their dealings that Dr Switkowski thought %%sqt%% should have been left behind %%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[While some of their predictions turned out to be sound%%lst%% their assessment was ]n[ the only reasonable commercial view that could have been taken%%per%% 
2587 It follows that I do ]n[ think that the entry into the Foxtel Put involved %%sqt%% subjective overbidding %%sqt%%%%lst%% as Seven submits%%per%%]$~ 
~$[While the commercial judgment supporting a bid at $30 million per annum ]f[ the AFL pay television rights was flawed%%lst%% I do ]n[ think that the bid was made in the knowledge by the decision%%dsh%%makers that it was certain ]v[ even very likely to be loss%%dsh%%making over the term of the rights agreement%%per%%]$~ 
~$[There was clearly a significant commercial risk%%lst%% as the decision%%dsh%%makers perceived%%lst%% ]b[ News ]^[ Foxtel%%lst%% like Mr Stokes%%lst%% were prepared to run the risk%%per%% 
15%%per%%8 Inferior Option? 
2588 The conclusions I have reached make it difficult ]f[ Seven to establish that the acquisition of the AFL pay television rights by Foxtel was both an inferior option ]^[ known to be an inferior option%%lst%% to the alternative of Foxtel taking the C7 channels including coverage of the AFL%%per%%]$~ 
~$[As Seven acknowledges%%lst%% it is%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%somewhat difficult to undertake a comparison between the direct acquisition of AFL rights ]^[ the carriage of C7%%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It is also difficult to know what comparison Foxtel%%lst%% through Foxtel Management%%lst%% could have made in December 2000%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Everything would have depended upon which AFL matches C7 could have offered ]^[ the terms upon which any offer might have been made%%per%%]$~ 
~$[That%%lst%% in turn%%lst%% would have depended%%lst%% in part%%lst%% on the price C7 paid ]f[ the rights%%per%% 
2589 Seven approaches this difficulty by relying on the evidence of Mr Williams%%lst%% who was CEO of Foxtel Management at the time he gave evidence%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Williams was asked to %%cmp%% what Seven described as %%sqt%% the proposed pay TV schedule included in Seven%%sqt%%s offer to the AFL of 14 December 2000 %%sqt%% with Foxtel%%sqt%%s entitlement under its arrangement with News%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It was put to Mr Williams that the schedule provided three nationwide slots ]f[ pay television in each week%%lst%% plus additional live games in other cities%%per%%]$~ 
~$[On this basis%%lst%% Mr Williams agreed that the AFL coverage would be a %%sqt%% significant improvement %%sqt%% over that available to Foxtel under the News%%dsh%%Foxtel Licence%%per%% 
2590 As PBL points out%%lst%% the schedule put to Mr Williams was never put to Foxtel%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It was %%cmp_tf%% ]n[ feasible ]f[ Foxtel%%lst%% prior to the teleconference of 13 December 2000%%lst%% to make the comparison Mr Williams was asked to make in the witness box%%per%%]$~ 
~$[A more substantial problem ]f[ Seven is that the presentation it made to the AFL did ]n[ lock it into a commitment to a particular pay television schedule%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Seven told the AFL that it would offer %%sqt%% live ]^[ exclusive coverage of up to three matches%%lst%% depending on scheduling of matches %%sqt%% on pay television (emphasis added)%%per%% 
2591 In his cross%%dsh%%examination%%lst%% Mr Wise conceded that this language was chosen quite deliberately %%cmp_b%% Seven did ]n[ wish to guarantee three matches per week ]f[ pay television%%per%%]$~ 
~$[He accepted that Seven wished to have the flexibility to decide how many games would be broadcast on pay television%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Although Mr Wise maintained that the presentation was intended to define the pay television rights in a %%sqt%% conclusive way %%sqt%%%%lst%% clearly it did not%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The comparison Mr Williams was asked to make was ]n[ helpful in comparing Foxtel%%sqt%%s entitlement under the Foxtel Put ]^[ any alternative programming that might have been provided through C7%%sqt%%s channels%%per%% 
2592 No doubt it is true%%lst%% as Mr Williams accepted%%lst%% that direct negotiations between Foxtel ]^[ Seven might well have led to a precise definition of the pay television rights%%lst%% just as ultimately occurred in the agreement between Fox Sports ]^[ Foxtel%%per%%]$~ 
~$[That proposition does ]n[ mean that Foxtel had a ready means%%lst%% while the bidding process was under way%%lst%% of comparing the position%%lst%% should its bid succeed%%lst%% with its position should it acquire AFL content by taking C7%%sqt%%s channels%%per%% 
2593 It is also significant that the last proposal that Foxtel had received from C7 was its %%sqt%% final offer %%sqt%% of 17 November 1999%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The fee structure proposed in C7%%sqt%%s offer was very much higher %%cmp_ta%% the earlier proposals made by C7 to Foxtel%%lst%% ]^[ in effect%%lst%% required Foxtel to take C7 on basic%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Stokes acknowledged that%%lst%% %%cmp_if%% Foxtel had accepted the offer%%lst%% it would have cost Foxtel many multiples of the price which had been the subject of earlier negotiations between Seven ]^[ Foxtel%%per%%]$~ 
~$[No doubt these considerations have played some part in Seven%%sqt%%s forensic decision ]n[ to rely on Foxtel%%sqt%%s rejection of the offer as a contravention of s 46 of the TP Act%%per%% 
2594 For present purposes%%lst%% the significance of C7%%sqt%%s offer of 17 November 1999 is in relation to any comparison Foxtel could have undertaken in December 2000 between the cost of acquiring the AFL pay television rights from the AFL (through News) ]^[ the cost of acquiring AFL content through C7%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The November 1999 offer had been C7%%sqt%%s most recent proposal%%lst%% subject only to Mr Wood%%sqt%%s somewhat disingenuous letter of 6 December 1999 in response to Foxtel%%sqt%%s rejection of the proposal%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Any comparison between C7%%sqt%%s November 1999 offer ]^[ the cost of directly acquiring the AFL pay television rights ]f[ 2002 to 2006 would have been very difficult%%per%%]$~ 
~$[As News%%sqt%% submissions suggest%%lst%% the comparison would have involved an assessment of many imponderables%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Nonetheless%%lst%% there is no basis ]f[ concluding that the comparison would have demonstrated that the cost of direct acquisition would have been greater %%cmp_ta%% the cost of taking C7 on the terms C7 put forward in November 1999%%per%%]$~ 
~$[On the contrary%%lst%% the likelihood is that any comparison would have been distinctly adverse to C7%%per%% 
15%%per%%9 Direct Acquisition of the AFL Pay Television Rights 
15%%per%%9%%per%%1 Was the Acquisition Inexplicable? 
2595 A further aspect of Seven%%sqt%%s factual case on purpose is that Foxtel declined to carry C7 in 1998 ]^[ 1999 essentially ]f[ spurious reasons ]^[ that the true reason%%lst%% ]v[ at least a substantial reason%%lst%% was that News simply did ]n[ want an alternative to Fox Sports to be available on the Foxtel platform%%per%%]$~ 
~$[This is said to support the contention that News ]^[ Foxtel (with the support of PBL) sought to acquire the AFL pay television rights directly%%lst%% rather %%cmp_ta%% from C7%%lst%% ]n[ simply %%cmp_b%% it was in the interests of Foxtel to obtain attractive sporting rights%%lst%% ]b[ substantially %%cmp_b%% the acquisition was part of the plan to kill C7%%per%%]$~ 
~$[According to Seven%%lst%% the decision to acquire the rights was %%sqt%% inexplicable except as conduct designed to hinder C7 from competing with Fox Sports %%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The direct acquisition of the rights %%sqt%% was%%lst%% ]^[ would have been perceived to be%%lst%% an inferior option %%sqt%%%%per%% 
2596 To some extent%%lst%% I have already addressed this contention%%per%%]$~ 
~$[I have found that the reason Mr Macourt refused to contemplate taking C7 on Foxtel was his view that the Fox Sports pricing dispute had to be resolved first%%per%% 
(I shall return to Foxtel%%sqt%%s refusal to take C7%%sqt%%s channels in Chapter 16%%per%% 
) I have also found that Foxtel did ]n[ engage in %%sqt%% subjective overbidding %%sqt%% ]f[ the AFL pay television rights ]^[ that News ]^[ Foxtel did ]n[ know%%lst%% in December 2000%%lst%% that the direct acquisition of the AFL pay television rights was %%sqt%% an inferior option %%sqt%% to taking C7%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Nonetheless%%lst%% I shall consider%%lst%% relatively briefly%%lst%% whether the decision%%dsh%%makers at News ]^[ Foxtel considered that they had legitimate grounds ]f[ seeking to acquire the AFL pay television rights directly%%per%% 
2597 It is important to appreciate%%lst%% as I have previously pointed out%%lst%% that News was interested in acquiring the AFL pay television rights as early as 1997%%lst%% when the Docklands Stadium Consortium Agreement was signed%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It is also important to bear in mind that the responsible executives at News ]^[ Foxtel considered%%lst%% at all times%%lst%% that the acquisition of AFL content was critical to Foxtel increasing its penetration rates in the southern States%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The AFL was the last sporting link ]f[ Foxtel ]^[ thus the rights%%lst%% in one form ]v[ another%%lst%% were commercially important to it%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Indeed this much is common ground%%lst%% since the significance of AFL content to Foxtel forms an essential plank in Seven%%sqt%%s case under s 46 of the TP Act%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It follows that this is ]n[ a case where a large ]^[ well%%dsh%%resourced corporation acquires an asset that is of marginal ]v[ purely speculative value to its operations ]^[ the true economic worth of the asset lies only in the harm the acquisition will occasion a competitor%%per%% 
2598 The planning within Foxtel to acquire the AFL pay television rights began in February 1999%%lst%% with Mr Mockridge%%sqt%%s draft outline%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The outline noted that Seven%%lst%% the current holder of the rights%%lst%% had a vested interest in maximising free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air coverage ]^[ giving as little as possible to pay television%%per%%]$~ 
~$[This analysis led to the Foxtel Management board authorising Mr Mockridge%%lst%% on 23 March 1999%%lst%% to lead efforts to obtain the AFL pay television rights on a non%%dsh%%exclusive basis%%per%%]$~ 
~$[By this time Mr Mockridge had suggested to Mr Lachlan Murdoch that Foxtel should consider taking AFL content from C7%%per%%]$~ 
~$[However%%lst%% Mr Mockridge made it clear that an arrangement with C7 would ]n[ be to the exclusion of dealing directly with the AFL ]f[ the acquisition of the rights%%per%%]$~ 
~$[This approach was confirmed in a note he distributed at a meeting on 8 April 1999%%lst%% which envisaged that Foxtel could take the AFL pay television rights %%sqt%% short term from C7 ]^[ long term directly %%sqt%%%%per%% 
2599 The %%sqt%% AFL Strategy %%sqt%% paper distributed to Foxtel Management board members in late June 1999 is an important document%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The paper identified the AFL as the %%sqt%% one remaining gap %%sqt%% in Foxtel%%sqt%%s programming ]^[ explained why direct acquisition of the AFL pay television rights was important to Foxtel%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The paper described ]^[ %%cmp%%d C7%%sqt%%s proposal to sell non%%dsh%%exclusive rights to Foxtel%%lst%% with the possible structure of Foxtel%%sqt%%s arrangement to acquire the AFL pay television rights through News%%per%% 
15%%per%%9%%per%%2 A Gate%%dsh%%keeper Role 
2600 Seven seems to suggest that the concerns expressed in the AFL Strategy paper ]^[ subsequently about Seven%%sqt%%s gate%%dsh%%keeping role were ]n[ genuine%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The fact is that the concerns about Seven%%sqt%%s role as a gate%%dsh%%keeper were repeatedly expressed in circumstances which suggest that they were indeed genuinely held%%per%%]$~ 
~$[For example%%lst%% Mr Mockridge%%sqt%%s memorandum of 29 March 1999%%lst%% to Foxtel staff working on the AFL bid%%lst%% suggested drafting a submission that emphasised that the%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%AFL should entrust its Pay%%dsh%%TV product to a proper Pay%%dsh%%TV operator ]^[ ]n[ permit a free operator on the defensive to be the gatekeeper%%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It was this idea that found its way into the June 1999 AFL Strategy paper%%per%% 
2601 Mr Mockridge%%sqt%%s paper ]f[ the Foxtel Management board meeting of 26 October 1999 expressed the strong view that %%cmp_if%% Seven was left as the %%sqt%% gate%%dsh%%keeper %%sqt%% on AFL pay television rights%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%it is unlikely that the network will ever co%%dsh%%operate by releasing sufficient exclusive live pay television games to permit AFL to become a true subscription driver ]f[ pay television%%sqt%%%%per%% 
2602 The point made by Mr Mockridge was ]n[ novel%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Harold Anderson%%lst%% Seven%%sqt%%s Director of Sports at the relevant time%%lst%% agreed in his evidence that his experience in New Zealand was that a pay television operator should ]n[ leave a free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air operator as the gate%%dsh%%keeper to determine what rights the pay television operator should have%%per%%]$~ 
~$[That this observation had force in the present context was demonstrated by evidence of the difficulties C7 experienced on the occasions when Seven%%sqt%%s executives decided that its free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air television outlets needed to be given priority as to sporting content over the interests of C7%%per%% 
2603 A very considerable amount of cross%%dsh%%examination was devoted to establishing that concerns about Seven%%sqt%%s gate%%dsh%%keeping role might have been met by entering into agreements precisely defining Foxtel%%sqt%%s entitlements%%lst%% just as occurred in relation to the Foxtel Put%%per%%]$~ 
~$[No doubt this has force as a theoretical proposition%%lst%% as some witnesses%%lst%% including Mr Williams%%lst%% acknowledged%%per%%]$~ 
~$[But Foxtel operated in a commercial world of rivalry%%lst%% lack of trust (particularly in relation to Seven%%sqt%%s real ]v[ exaggerated litigious propensities) ]^[ uncertainty as to what terms might be negotiated%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The potential difficulties were nicely illustrated by the terms of Seven%%sqt%%s final presentation to the AFL (in the context of a bid ]f[ the AFL broadcasting rights)%%lst%% which were carefully structured to preserve flexibility ]f[ Seven%%sqt%%s free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air AFL programming%%per%%]$~ 
~$[They are also illustrated by C7%%sqt%%s retreat%%lst%% in its letter of 9 June 1999%%lst%% from the commitment it had given in May 1999 to ensuring that two exclusively live AFL matches would be shown on C7 each week%%per%% 
2604 Mr Macourt said in evidence that he had been influenced by the fact that Seven could have allowed more pay television games on SportsVision ]b[ it had not%%lst%% indicating a preference ]f[ protecting its free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air operations%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Macourt was later asked about negotiating with a company holding both free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air ]^[ pay television rights%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%[MR SUMPTION:] What I was suggesting to you was that %%cmp_if%% you have a situation in which all the free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air rights ]^[ all the Pay TV rights are held by companies in the same group ]^[ the company holding Pay TV rights wishes to negotiate the carriage of his channel on a platform like Foxtel%%lst%% it is easier ]f[ Foxtel to negotiate terms as to how many games will be released ]f[ exclusive Pay TV transmission %%cmp_b%% he is negotiating with somebody who is part of the same group as the free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air broadcaster in a position to release the games%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Do you follow my point? 
%%dsh%%%%dsh%%%%dsh%% I think so%%per%%]$~ 
~$[I%%sqt%%m ]n[ sure I agree with it%%per%% 
%%per%%%%per%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[An example where %%per%%%%per%%%%per%% the point which you make doesn%%sqt%%t seem to hold true is we attempted to negotiate the Commonwealth Games rights from Channel 9 shortly after SportsVision went into receivership%%lst%% ]^[ we were unable to negotiate an agreement that was satisfactory both financially ]^[ quality wise%%per%%]$~ 
~$[I%%sqt%%m sure you can find an example that proves me wrong%%lst%% ]b[ my perception is%%lst%% no%%lst%% I don%%sqt%%t agree%%per%% 
[HIS HONOUR:] But that was a case where FoxSports [sic] were negotiating with an entity that held both free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air ]^[ Pay TV rights? 
%%dsh%%%%dsh%%%%dsh%% That%%sqt%%s right%%per%%

[MR SUMPTION:] Now%%lst%% %%cmp_if%% you are being offered by the holder of some Pay TV rights a channel with a particular number of games per week ]^[ you want to say%%lst%% %%dqt%%We don%%sqt%%t think that%%sqt%%s enough%%per%%]$~ 
~$[We want you to show more games per week live%%dqt%%%%lst%% it%%sqt%%s easier%%lst%% isn%%sqt%%t it%%lst%% to negotiate that %%cmp_if%% you are dealing with somebody who is an associated company of the holder of the free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air rights %%cmp_ta%% it is %%cmp_if%% you are not%%scn%% that%%sqt%%s logic%%lst%% isn%%sqt%%t it? 
%%dsh%%%%dsh%%%%dsh%% I can see the logic%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It depends on what the alternative is%%per%%]$~ 
~$[If you are negotiating with the owner of the rights%%lst%% %%cmp_t%% the owner of the rights can dictate to the free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air broadcaster what rights ]^[ how they are prepared to sell those rights%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Our experience is that it has been easier to do that %%cmp_ta%% it has been to negotiate with free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air broadcasters on those rights%%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[I accept that this evidence reflects Mr Macourt%%sqt%%s understanding of the position in 1999 ]^[ 2000%%per%% 
2605 A further aspect of the gate%%dsh%%keeper role was the concern expressed within Foxtel at the threat posed by the possibility that legislative changes would open the way to free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air networks being permitted to engage in multi%%dsh%%channelling%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Mockridge%%sqt%%s AFL Strategy paper ]f[ Foxtel Management%%sqt%%s 8 July 1999 board meeting made the point that %%cmp_if%% Seven was left with monopoly control of AFL content ]^[ %%cmp_if%% multi%%dsh%%channelling was permitted%%lst%% Seven would be in an excellent position to attack Foxtel%%sqt%%s subscriber base%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In fact%%lst%% at about this time Seven was making submissions to the Commonwealth Government arguing in favour of multi%%dsh%%channelling ]f[ free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air operators%%per%% 
2606 The point%%lst%% it seems to me%%lst%% is ]n[ whether there was an alternative commercial approach available to Foxtel to satisfy its desire to acquire AFL content%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The question is whether its decision to attempt to acquire the AFL pay television rights directly from the AFL%%lst%% rather %%cmp_ta%% acquire AFL content through C7%%lst%% indicated that News ]^[ Foxtel had a substantial purpose of killing C7 in order to achieve market dominance%%lst%% rather %%cmp_ta%% a legitimate commercial objective intended to enhance Foxtel%%sqt%%s product in the marketplace%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The fact that genuine concerns were held within Foxtel about Seven%%sqt%%s gate%%dsh%%keeper role suggests a negative answer to the question%%per%% 
15%%per%%9%%per%%3 Quality of C7 
2607 Similarly%%lst%% I think the evidence indicates that there was genuine concern within Foxtel as to the quality of C7%%sqt%%s channels%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The parties in effect invited me to undertake a kind of royal commission into the comparative attributes ]^[ deficiencies of Fox Sports ]^[ C7%%per%%]$~ 
~$[I said during the hearing that I failed to see the point of this exercise%%per%%]$~ 
~$[My scepticism did ]n[ deter the parties from referring me to a vast amount of material relating to the merits ]v[ demerits of each service%%lst%% the bulk of which I regard as largely irrelevant to the issues in this case ]v[ simply unhelpful%%per%%]$~ 
~$[However%%lst%% the critical question ]f[ present purposes is whether News ]v[ Foxtel considered that quality issues with C7 added weight to the arguments ]f[ seeking the AFL pay television rights directly from the AFL%%per%% 
2608 I do ]n[ doubt that some of the references to the quality of C7 in the correspondence drafted within News ]v[ Foxtel were self%%dsh%%serving ]v[ perhaps intended to score points%%per%%]$~ 
~$[But the contemporaneous documentation suggests that the quality of C7 was a genuine concern to News ]^[ Foxtel%%per%%]$~ 
~$[As I have noted%%lst%% the issue was explicitly raised in the AFL Strategy paper ]f[ the Foxtel Management board meeting of 8 July 1999%%per%%]$~ 
~$[A little earlier%%lst%% on 24 May 1999%%lst%% Mr Freudenstein included in the term sheet he sent to Mr Wood detailed provisions as to content%%lst%% scheduling ]^[ production%%lst%% designed to ensure that Foxtel was %%sqt%% happy with the quality ]^[ content of the channel %%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Macourt told Mr Gammell at their meeting of 4 December 2000 that the quality of C7 was flawed ]^[ that the business had been run ]f[ the benefit of Seven%%lst%% ]n[ pay television%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The teleconference of 13 December 2000 included a number of comments by Mr Philip ]^[ Mr Moriarty to the effect that C7%%sqt%%s quality was poor%%per%% 
2609 The material relating to the objective %%sqt%% quality %%sqt%% of C7 is%%lst%% to a limited extent%%lst%% relevant to this issue%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Optus had raised issues of the quality of C7 with Seven on a number of occasions%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It is a reasonable inference that these complaints were known%%lst%% at least in outline%%lst%% in the industry%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The fact that subscribers to C7 made a significant number of complaints that its AFL games were sometimes shown concurrently on free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air television was also likely to be widely known in the industry%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Similarly%%lst%% the complaints within Seven itself that C7 games usually received four%%dsh%%camera coverage%%lst%% %%cmp%%d with the standard nine%%dsh%%camera coverage ]f[ free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air games%%lst%% would have struck a chord with informed viewers ]^[ people within the industry%%per%% 
15%%per%%10 Conclusion 
2610 In my view%%lst%% Seven has ]n[ established that the Foxtel Partnership%%sqt%%s bid ]f[ the AFL pay television rights lacked a plausible commercial rationale%%per%% 
2611 In these circumstances%%lst%% it seems to me very difficult to attribute to News%%lst%% Foxtel ]v[ PBL the objective of destroying C7%%per%%]$~ 
~$[I accept that both Mr Macourt ]^[ Mr Philip appreciated that C7 might well suffer serious ]^[ perhaps even irremediable harm %%cmp_if%% Foxtel%%sqt%%s bid succeeded%%per%%]$~ 
~$[As I have found%%lst%% I do ]n[ think that either would have been perturbed by this possible consequence%%per%% 
2612 I do ]n[ think%%lst%% however%%lst%% that the evidence warrants a conclusion that News ]v[ Foxtel actually sought the objective of destroying C7 as a means of securing market dominance ]f[ Fox Sports (or Foxtel)%%lst%% as distinct from the objective of acquiring rights thought to be of considerable value to Foxtel%%sqt%%s business%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The killing of C7 was neither the primary purpose nor a substantial purpose of News%%sqt%% ]^[ Foxtel%%sqt%%s bid ]f[ the AFL pay television rights%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Thus the purpose of the Master Agreement Provision%%lst%% ]s[ far as News was concerned%%lst%% was ]n[ the substantial lessening of competition in the sense advanced by Seven%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The same conclusion applies to the other provisions relied on by Seven ]f[ its case under s 45(2) of the TP Act %%per%% 
2613 I do ]n[ understand Seven to submit that%%lst%% %%cmp_if%% I find that News did ]n[ have the purpose of substantially lessening competition in entering into the Master Agreement ]v[ the other contracts identified by Seven%%lst%% such a purpose should be attributed to PBL%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In any event%%lst%% I see no basis ]f[ doing so%%per%%

~$[They continued (205 CLR%%lst%% at 21 [43])%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%The notion of market power as the capacity to act in a manner unconstrained by the conduct of competitors is reflected in the terms of s 46(3)%%per%%]$~

~$[Market power may ]v[ may ]n[ be total%%scn%% what is required ]f[ the purposes of s 46 is that it be substantial%%sqt%%%%per%% 
2640 The expression %%sqt%% take advantage of %%sqt%% in s 46(1) does ]n[ require proof of any hostile intent%%per%%]$~

~$[Section 46(1) distinguishes between %%dqt%%taking advantage%%dqt%% ]^[ %%dqt%%purpose%%dqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The conduct of %%dqt%%taking advantage of%%dqt%% a thing is ]n[ identical with the conduct of protecting that thing%%per%%]$~

2643 In Melway Publishing v Hicks %%lst%% the joint judgment (205 CLR%%lst%% at 23 [50]) interpreted the decision in Queensland Wire as resting on a finding that %%cmp_if%% there had been a competitive market ]f[ Y%%dsh%%bar%%lst%% BHP would ]n[ have been able (as it did) to refuse to supply Y%%dsh%%bar to QWI (which wished to use the Y%%dsh%%bar to make star picket fences in competition with a BHP subsidiary)%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The joint judgment%%lst%% while dubious about the particular factual finding in Queensland Wire %%lst%% accepted that that case stood ]f[ the proposition that%%cln%%

~$[The important thing was that%%lst%% once it was concluded that in a competitive market BHP would have been constrained to supply QWI%%lst%% ]^[ that BHP%%sqt%%s ability to refuse to supply resulted from the absence of such constraint%%lst%% it followed that%%lst%% in refusing to supply (for an anti%%dsh%%competitive purpose)%%lst%% BHP was taking advantage of its market power%%sqt%%%%per%%

The High Court answered that question in the affirmative%%lst%% %%cmp_b%% Melway%%sqt%%s segmented distribution system had predated its position of market dominance ]^[ there was no reason to believe that it would ]n[ be willing ]^[ able to continue its system in a competitive market%%sqt%%%%per%% 
(Emphasis added%%per%% 
) 
2650 The Full Court accepted that Rural Press%%sqt%% threat to compete in region B had been made more credible by the fact that it had access to a printing press ]^[ to the necessary staff ]^[ skills in region A%%per%%]$~ 
~$[But that did ]n[ involve any use of its market power in region A%%per%%]$~ 
~$[A new entrant into the region A market%%lst%% even %%cmp_if%% lacking market power%%lst%% could have made the same credible threat in relation to region B provided it had the requisite facilities ]^[ expertise%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The Court held that the mere use by a corporation of resources derived from the region A market%%lst%% where it has market power%%lst%% to facilitate conduct in the region B market%%lst%% where it has no such power%%lst%% does ]n[ involve taking advantage of power in the region A market%%cln%% 118 FCR%%lst%% at 277 [146]%%per%% 
2651 In the High Court%%lst%% the ACCC argued that the Full Federal Court had applied the wrong test by asking whether Rural Press %%sqt%% could %%sqt%% have engaged in the same conduct in the absence of market power%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The joint judgment pointed out that precisely this test had been applied in Melway Publishing v Hicks %%per%%]$~ 
~$[Their Honours said the test meant what it said%%per%%]$~ 
~$[They continued as follows (216 CLR%%lst%% at 76%%dsh%%77 [53])%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%The [ACCC] failed to show that the conduct of Rural Press was materially facilitated by the market power in giving the threats a significance they would ]n[ have had without it%%per%%]$~ 
~$[What gave those threats significance was something distinct from market power%%lst%% namely their material ]^[ organisational assets%%per%%]$~

16%%per%%4 Seven%%sqt%%s Submissions 
16%%per%%4%%per%%1 Overview 
2653 Seven relies on Foxtel%%sqt%%s failure to accept what Seven describes as %%sqt%% offers %%sqt%% made by C7 in 1999%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The offers are identified in Seven%%sqt%%s Closing Submissions as those made by Mr Wood to Mr Mockridge ]v[ Mr Freudenstein on 16 April 1999%%lst%% 13 May 1999%%lst%% 9 June 1999 ]^[ 17 November 1999%%per%%]$~ 
~$[However%%lst%% Seven does ]n[ rely (for very good reasons) on Foxtel%%sqt%%s rejection of the 17 November 1999 offer as giving rise to a discrete cause of action%%per%% 
2654 Seven says that the evidence justifies a finding that by refusing C7%%sqt%%s offers ]^[ refusing to negotiate with C7 ]f[ the carriage of its channels%%lst%% Foxtel effectively deprived itself of the ability to fill the gap in its sports programming line%%dsh%%up ]f[ a period of two ]^[ a half years%%lst%% until the end of the 2001 AFL season%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Foxtel thereby deprived itself of the ability to compete more effectively against Optus%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Moreover%%lst%% it denied itself the opportunity of deriving additional profits from the carriage of C7%%sqt%%s channels%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Seven%%sqt%%s primary position is that Foxtel decided ]n[ to take C7 under any circumstances during the period from June 1999 to December 2000%%per%% 
2655 Seven relies on three other matters%%lst%% individually ]v[ together%%lst%% as showing that Foxtel took advantage of its substantial power in the retail pay television market%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Sumption characterised the central purpose of Foxtel%%sqt%%s conduct as%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%facilitating the acquisition of the AFL rights in order %%per%%%%per%%%%per%% to make Foxtel ]^[ Fox Sports the dominant participants in their respective markets ]^[ to marginalise C7%%sqt%%%%per%% 
2657 Initially%%lst%% Seven invited me to reject Foxtel%%sqt%%s explanations ]f[ its refusal to take C7 ]^[ ]f[ the other conduct of which Seven complains%%per%% 
2658 However%%lst%% in his oral closing submissions%%lst%% Mr Sumption accepted that one reason ]f[ Foxtel rejecting C7 was that News ]^[ PBL refused to deal with C7 until the dispute with Telstra concerning the supply of Fox Sports to Foxtel was resolved%%per%% 
2659 Mr Sumption also readily accepted that one of the reasons ]f[ Foxtel declining to take C7 was that it did ]n[ wish to prejudice the bid ]f[ the AFL pay television rights by signalling to the AFL that C7 could secure carriage on the Foxtel platform%%per%%]$~ 
~$[He contended%%lst%% however%%lst%% that this reason actually assists Seven%%sqt%%s case %%cmp_b%% it is consistent only with Foxtel wishing the AFL to gain the false impression that C7 would never get onto the Foxtel platform%%lst%% even %%cmp_if%% C7 succeeded in obtaining the AFL pay television rights%%per%% 
2660 Seven%%sqt%%s submissions in relation to s 46 of the TP Act proceed on the basis that Foxtel had a substantial degree of power in the retail pay television market%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Seven submits%%lst%% relying on the decision of the Full Federal Court in Eastern Express v General Newspapers 35 FCR%%lst%% at 60%%dsh%%62%%lst%% per Lockhart ]^[ Gummow JJ%%lst%% that the conduct of Foxtel should be understood as the conduct of each of the partners (Sky Cable ]^[ Telstra Media)%%lst%% acting through its agent%%lst%% Foxtel Management%%per%% 
16%%per%%4%%per%%2 Refusals to Accept C7%%sqt%%s Proposals 
16%%per%%4%%per%%2%%per%%1 16 APRIL 1999 LETTER 
2661 In its Closing Submissions%%lst%% Seven characterises C7%%sqt%%s letter of 16 April 1999 as an %%sqt%% offer %%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It contends that the pricing proposed in the offer was %%sqt%% consistent with an amount that Foxtel%%sqt%%s management would have recommended that Foxtel pay %%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Seven invites me to find that Foxtel%%sqt%%s modelling showed that the carriage of C7 on the terms offered by it would have been very profitable ]f[ Foxtel%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Even so%%lst%% Foxtel rejected the offer%%per%% 
2662 In Seven%%sqt%%s Reply submissions%%lst%% the letter is no longer characterised as an offer%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Seven now says that its case does ]n[ depend on the letter being an offer in the strict contractual sense%%lst%% notwithstanding that the Statement of Claim refers to %%sqt%% written offers %%sqt%% ]^[ alleges that the offers were ]n[ accepted%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Rather%%lst%% the conduct relied upon in Seven%%sqt%%s Reply Submissions is the failure of Foxtel %%sqt%% to accept those terms ]f[ incorporation into an agreement between Foxtel ]^[ C7 %%sqt%%%%per%% 
2663 Seven submits that a price comparison with Austar is irrelevant %%cmp_b%% Foxtel%%sqt%%s refusal to accept the terms had nothing to do with price%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Foxtel never suggested that the price was too high and%%lst%% in any event%%lst%% C7 was offering it more %%cmp_ta%% the agreement with Austar provided (44 AFL matches versus 16 per annum)%%per%% 
16%%per%%4%%per%%2%%per%%2 13 MAY 1999 LETTER 
2664 Seven says that the letter of 13 May 1999 merely clarified the terms proposed by C7 in the April 1999 letter%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It should %%cmp_tf%% be considered together with the earlier letter%%per%% 
16%%per%%4%%per%%2%%per%%3 9 JUNE 1999 LETTER 
2665 Both Seven%%sqt%%s Closing Submissions ]^[ Reply Submissions refer to the letter of 9 June 1999 as an offer%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Seven recognises that the letter actually proposed an increase in the price that Foxtel would have to pay ]f[ the supply of C7%%sqt%%s channels%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Once again%%lst%% however%%lst%% Seven submits that the rejection of the offer had nothing to do with price ]v[ the terms of the offer%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In any event%%lst%% Foxtel appreciated that the offer%%lst%% %%cmp_if%% accepted%%lst%% would still have proved profitable ]f[ its business%%per%% 
16%%per%%4%%per%%3 Refusal to Deal 
2666 Seven submits that Foxtel%%sqt%%s refusal to accept the two offers ]^[ its determination%%lst%% between June 1999 ]^[ December 2000%%lst%% ]n[ to take the C7 channels %%sqt%% on any terms %%sqt%% were the product of its desire to harm C7 ]^[ to confer competition%%dsh%%related benefits on Fox Sports ]^[ on Foxtel itself%%per%% 
2667 In its Reply Submissions%%lst%% Seven answers the Respondents%%sqt%% contention that a commercially rational Foxtel%%lst%% on the counter%%dsh%%factual hypothesis that it lacked market power%%lst%% could have refused C7%%sqt%%s April ]^[ June 1999 offers %%cmp_b%% the price proposed was more %%cmp_ta%% Austar%%sqt%%s ]^[ ]f[ the same content%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Seven says that this was ]n[ the reason ]f[ Foxtel%%sqt%%s refusal ]^[ that a corporation takes advantage of market power notwithstanding that its conduct could have been (but was ]n[ in fact) done ]f[ a different reason%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Foxtel%%sqt%%s conduct was undertaken ]f[ the wider purpose of preventing competition between C7 ]^[ Fox Sports%%per%% 
2668 Seven contends that Foxtel clearly regarded the absence of AFL programming as a significant gap in its line%%dsh%%up%%lst%% ]^[ that such programming would have enabled it to compete more effectively against Optus%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In refusing C7%%sqt%%s offers ]^[ in declining to negotiate ]f[ the carriage of C7%%lst%% Foxtel effectively deprived itself of the ability to fill the gap ]f[ two ]^[ a half years%%lst%% until the end of the 2001 AFL season%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Indeed%%lst%% Seven maintains that Foxtel%%sqt%%s conduct%%lst%% in breaking off negotiations with C7 in mid%%dsh%%1999 ]^[ in persisting with its refusal to deal with C7%%lst%% lacked any business rationale%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Its bidding ]f[ the AFL pay television rights against a potential supplier had the inevitable consequence that the cost of rights would be substantially inflated%%per%% 
2669 Seven submits that in May 1999 Mr Mockridge had at least an open mind as to the benefits of Foxtel acquiring C7%%per%%]$~ 
~$[But by the time of the July 1999 board meeting he knew that News would ]n[ support Foxtel taking C7 until the long%%dsh%%term arrangements with Fox Sports had been finalised%%per%%]$~ 
~$[PBL shared this view%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Mockridge%%sqt%%s draft board paper ]f[ the October 1999 Foxtel board meeting proposed taking C7 as an interim arrangement%%lst%% ]b[ he removed the paragraph in the face of Mr Lachlan Murdoch%%sqt%%s refusal to contemplate taking C7 until the Fox Sports issue was resolved%%per%% 
2670 Because of the disputes between the Foxtel partners ]^[ the intractable opposition of News ]^[ PBL to Foxtel carrying C7 (as Telstra fully realised at the time)%%lst%% there was no occasion ]f[ News ]v[ PBL to exercise a formal veto at a board meeting%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Accordingly%%lst%% Seven argues there was no point putting the question to the board%%per%% 
2671 Seven further argues that even %%cmp_if%% Foxtel%%sqt%%s reason ]f[ declining to take C7 was ]n[ to kill C7%%lst%% ]b[ to put off the issue until resolution of the Fox Sports question ]v[ to secure a negotiating advantage in the bidding ]f[ the AFL pay television rights%%lst%% Foxtel still used its market power ]f[ a proscribed purpose%%per%% 
16%%per%%4%%per%%4 Statements to the AFL ]^[ the NRL Partnership 
2672 Seven points out that Sky Cable ]^[ News admit on the pleadings that representatives of Foxtel stated to the AFL that Foxtel could ]n[ be compelled to carry C7 as part of the Foxtel Service%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In any event%%lst%% Seven submits that a finding should be made that Foxtel communicated to the AFL that it would ]n[ carry C7 as part of the Foxtel Service (not merely that carriage on the Foxtel Service could ]n[ be guaranteed)%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Seven also seeks a finding that Foxtel was successful in persuading the AFL that C7 would ]n[ be carried on Foxtel%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The AFL %%cmp_tf%% proceeded on the basis that the C7 channels would ]n[ be carried on the Foxtel Service ]^[ that%%lst%% %%cmp_if%% it granted the pay television rights to C7 exclusively%%lst%% the AFL content would ]n[ be available to Foxtel%%sqt%%s subscribers%%per%% 
2673 Seven submits that the documents recording the AFL%%sqt%%s consideration of the bids show that it took the view that C7 had low penetration ]^[ was unlikely%%lst%% even %%cmp_if%% Seven succeeded in its bid%%lst%% to get on to the Foxtel Service%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Thus the AFL was influenced by its perception that there was no guarantee that C7 would have anything like the number of subscribers that Foxtel would be able to deliver with non%%dsh%%exclusive supply on the Foxtel%%lst%% Optus ]^[ Austar platforms%%per%% 
2674 Seven also relies on statements made by ]v[ on behalf of Foxtel to the NRL Partnership as conduct that involved taking advantage of Foxtel%%sqt%%s market power%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Seven invites me to find that Foxtel told the NRL Partnership that C7 would ]n[ be able to broadcast its channels on the Foxtel Service ]^[ that it also told the NRL that there was considerable uncertainty about whether ]^[ when C7 would gain access to the Telstra Cable%%per%%]$~ 
~$[These statements (which Seven does ]n[ suggest were untrue) were important to the NRL Partnership (through the NRL PEC)%%lst%% %%cmp_b%% of the NRL PEC%%sqt%%s concern to ensure maximum coverage ]f[ NRL matches%%per%% 
2675 Seven submits that in making these statements to the NRL Partnership%%lst%% Foxtel took advantage of its market power in the retail pay television market%%per%%]$~ 
~$[That power gave Foxtel%%sqt%%s threat added credibility%%per%% 
16%%per%%4%%per%%5 Overbidding 
2676 I have outlined in Chapter 15 Seven%%sqt%%s overbidding argument ]^[ given my reasons ]f[ rejecting it%%per%%]$~ 
~$[There is no need to repeat either the description ]v[ the analysis%%per%% 
16%%per%%4%%per%%6 Taking Advantage of Market Power 
2677 Seven recognises that in Rural Press v ACCC %%lst%% the High Court held that a firm may protect its market power by methods that do ]n[ involve taking advantage of that power%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Seven submits that the present case is different from Rural Press v ACCC %%lst%% %%cmp_b%% Foxtel was ]n[ merely acting to protect its market power%%per%%]$~ 
~$[On the contrary%%lst%% by refusing to take the C7 channels and%%lst%% in effect%%lst%% threatening the AFL%%lst%% Foxtel%%sqt%%s conduct was %%sqt%% materially facilitated by its market power %%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Seven identifies two ways in which Foxtel utilised its market power in relation to its decision ]n[ to negotiate with C7 ]f[ the carriage of its channels during the period from June 1999 until the end of December 2000%%cln%% its statements to the AFL ]^[ its entry into the Foxtel Put%%per%% 
2678 First%%lst%% Foxtel%%sqt%%s market power gave %%sqt%% content ]^[ significance %%sqt%% to its refusal to take the C7 channels ]^[ to its threat that AFL matches would ]n[ be shown to Foxtel subscribers even %%cmp_if%% C7 acquired the AFL pay television rights%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It was only %%cmp_b%% Foxtel already had a dominant share of the retail pay television market that it could credibly threaten to deny itself subscription%%dsh%%driving content%%lst%% such as the AFL%%lst%% %%cmp_if%% that content could only be obtained through C7%%per%% 
2679 Seven argues that %%cmp_if%% Foxtel had been operating in a competitive pay television market with its competitors eager to take AFL content%%lst%% Foxtel would have found it commercially impossible to refuse to take C7%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Furthermore%%lst%% a threat to refuse to carry C7 would ]n[ have been taken seriously by any third party%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It was only %%cmp_b%% Foxtel had a dominant share of the retail pay television market that the refusal to take C7 was such a %%sqt%% potent negotiating tactic %%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Foxtel%%sqt%%s conduct was materially facilitated by its market power%%per%%]$~ 
~$[According to Seven%%lst%% the conclusion that Foxtel utilised its market power in this sense does ]n[ depend on a finding that it expected to be able to recoup the costs of its conduct by any future exercise of its market power%%per%% 
2680 Secondly%%lst%% Foxtel refused to accept attractive ]^[ profitable programming%%lst%% in circumstances where it would ]n[ have engaged in that conduct in the absence of market power%%per%%]$~ 
~$[If it lacked market power%%lst%% it would have been exposed to a competitive response%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Foxtel could %%sqt%% afford %%sqt%% to refuse to carry C7 only %%cmp_b%% it contemplated deriving supra%%dsh%%competitive profits later in a market in which it had substantial market power%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In particular%%lst%% by declining to deal with C7%%lst%% Foxtel deprived itself of attractive programming that would have assisted it to compete with Optus (which already had C7)%%per%% 
2681 The absence of any analysis of the profitability of a direct acquisition %%cmp%%d with the profitability of carrying C7%%lst%% both from the period from June 1999 to 2001 ]^[ in the later period from 2002 to 2006%%lst%% was indicative of strategic conduct%%per%%]$~ 
~$[That is%%lst%% Foxtel hoped to confer the benefits of a sports channel supply monopoly on its associate%%lst%% Fox Sports%%lst%% ]^[ to benefit itself by entrenching its dominant position in the retail pay television market%%per%% 
2682 Seven submits that Foxtel%%sqt%%s conduct in refusing to take the C7 channels can be understood only as part of a strategy to maximise its long%%dsh%%term profits by entrenching its dominant position in the retail pay television market%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It argues that in a competitive market%%lst%% a profit%%dsh%%maximising firm would be unlikely to refuse to acquire an input that was likely to attract additional customers ]^[ increase profits%%per%% 
16%%per%%5 Telstra%%sqt%%s Submissions 
2683 I do ]n[ think it necessary to set out News%%sqt%% submissions in answer to Seven%%sqt%%s case under s 46(1) of the TP Act %%per%%]$~ 
~$[The critical issues raised by News should emerge clearly enough from my reasoning in this Chapter%%per%% 
2684 I should record%%lst%% however%%lst%% that Telstra seeks to distinguish the position of Telstra Media from that of its Foxtel partner%%lst%% Sky Cable%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Telstra submits that when conduct is the result of a %%sqt%% positive decision %%sqt%% by Foxtel%%lst%% it may be possible to attribute the market power of the firm to each partner%%per%%]$~ 
~$[But when the conduct of the firm involves a failure to act %%cmp_b%% of an actual ]v[ likely use of the veto power of one of the partners%%lst%% it is ]n[ permissible to attribute the market power of the partner exercising the right of veto%%lst%% nor of the firm%%lst%% to the partner ]n[ exercising that right of veto%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Accordingly%%lst%% %%cmp_if%% Foxtel did ]n[ take the C7 channels %%cmp_b%% of Sky Cable%%sqt%%s actual ]v[ threatened veto%%lst%% neither the market power of the Foxtel Partnership%%lst%% nor of Sky Cable%%lst%% can be attributed to Telstra Media%%per%% 
2685 According to Telstra%%lst%% even %%cmp_if%% Telstra Media had market power%%lst%% a mere failure by Foxtel to do something did ]n[ involve the exercise of market power by Telstra Media%%per%%]$~ 
~$[This follows%%lst%% ]s[ Telstra argues%%lst%% %%cmp_b%% Telstra Media%%lst%% unlike Sky Cable%%lst%% was always willing to accept C7 on the Foxtel platform on appropriate commercial terms%%per%%]$~

16%%per%%6%%per%%1%%per%%1 16 APRIL 1999 LETTER

~$[The vagueness of Seven%%sqt%%s revised position is illustrated by its assertion that Foxtel%%sqt%%s refusal to accept the terms set out in C7%%sqt%%s letter was ]n[ conduct that occurred at any particular time%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In my opinion%%lst%% it is ]n[ open to Seven to use its Reply Submissions to reconstruct a case outside the pleadings%%per%%

~$[It is even more difficult to see how it can be an exercise of market power to seek genuine clarification of indicative terms ]v[ to engage in negotiations as to the terms of a possible agreement%%per%%

~$[Negotiations ]^[ discussions continued between the parties%%per%%]$~

~$[As I have found%%lst%% the letter was a genuine proposal (even %%cmp_if%% it had deliberate ambiguities) ]^[ was intended to elicit a commercial response from Foxtel%%per%%]$~ 
~$[After the proposal had been made%%lst%% Mr Wood attempted to engage in negotiations with Mr Freudenstein%%lst%% ]b[ was unable to make contact with him until 30 June 1999%%per%%]$~ 
~$[At that time%%lst%% Mr Freudenstein informed Mr Wood that the whole idea of Foxtel taking C7 would be discussed at the forthcoming Foxtel Management board meeting%%lst%% although he also told Mr Wood that the pricing proposed by C7 was too high%%per%% 
2699 The issue was indeed discussed at Foxtel Management%%sqt%%s board meeting of 8 July 1999 (postponed from 22 June 1999)%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In the meantime%%lst%% the draft AFL Strategy papers%%lst%% prepared within Foxtel Management%%lst%% proposed an agreement to carry C7 from 1 July 1999 until 31 December 2001 (when the new rights period would commence)%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The drafts proposed that C7 should be carried as a stand alone channel to be sold by Foxtel to subscribers ]f[ $6%%per%%95 pspm%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Foxtel would pay no more %%cmp_ta%% $3%%per%%10 pspm (%%cmp%%d with $5%%per%%00 pspm in C7%%sqt%%s June 1999 term sheet) ]^[ would provide an MSG of $4 million per annum%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The business case%%lst%% also prepared within Foxtel Management%%lst%% produced a positive NPV of between $27%%per%%48 million ]^[ $70%%per%%32 million%%per%% 
2700 The final AFL Strategy paper presented to the meeting proposed that consideration of the potential carriage of C7 be deferred until an assessment could be made as to whether a decision to take C7 would detract from the proposed bid by Foxtel to acquire the AFL pay television rights directly%%per%% 
(At that stage%%lst%% the AFL pay television rights were expected to be awarded by the end of 1999%%lst%% although the rights themselves related to the years 2002 to 2006%%per%% 
) The paper argued the case ]f[ Foxtel to acquire the rights directly%%per%%]$~ 
~$[While the paper set out the terms of C7%%sqt%%s proposal%%lst%% it recommended against taking the proposal further%%lst%% in part %%cmp_b%% it was thought undesirable ]f[ Seven to be able to show the AFL that C7 could secure arrangements to supply all pay television platforms%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The board meeting neither accepted nor rejected the recommendations in the AFL Strategy paper%%lst%% ]b[ contemplated that informal discussions between Foxtel ]^[ the AFL would take place%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Telstra continued to contend that C7 should be regarded as a comparator of Fox Sports ]f[ the purposes of resolving the pricing dispute relating to the supply of Fox Sports to Foxtel%%per%% 
2701 There were two reasons ]f[ the disinclination of Foxtel Management at this time to pursue negotiations with C7 on behalf of Foxtel%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Neither had to do with the price asked by C7%%lst%% nor with the other proposed terms of supply%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The first reason was that Mr Mockridge had formed the view by late June 1999 that Foxtel should seek the AFL pay television rights directly%%per%%]$~ 
~$[He considered that any decision concerning the supply of C7 to Foxtel should be deferred until Foxtel could assess the extent to which a decision to take C7 would adversely affect its bid to acquire the pay television rights directly from the AFL%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Mockridge%%sqt%%s principal concern%%lst%% reflected in the final AFL Strategy paper ]^[ the discussion at the 8 July 1999 board meeting%%lst%% was that he did ]n[ want Seven to gain an advantage by presenting itself to the AFL as an established supplier to all pay television platforms%%per%% 
2702 The second reason was that News made it clear%%lst%% through Mr Macourt%%lst%% that it was ]n[ prepared to negotiate ]f[ the carriage of C7 on Foxtel%%lst%% even on a temporary basis%%lst%% until the pricing dispute relating to the carriage of Fox Sports on the Foxtel platform had been resolved%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The dispute was between News (supported by PBL) ]^[ Telstra%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Macourt%%sqt%%s concern%%lst%% as I have found%%lst%% was that Telstra would initiate legal proceedings based on News%%sqt%% alleged breaches of the Umbrella Agreement%%lst%% as a means of forcing Foxtel to replace Fox Sports with C7 on the Foxtel platform ]v[ to renegotiate the price paid by it to Fox Sports%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Macourt was ]n[ motivated by a blanket desire to prevent C7 gaining access to the Foxtel platform%%lst%% regardless of price ]v[ whether C7 was taken on basic ]v[ on a tier%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Nor was his objective in taking this stance to bring about the destruction of C7%%lst%% in order to increase Fox Sports%%sqt%% dominance in any market%%per%% 
2703 Mr Macourt%%sqt%%s concern%%lst%% no doubt in accordance with the views expressed to him by Mr Lachlan Murdoch%%lst%% was to prevent Telstra using the carriage of C7 on the Foxtel platform as a means of furthering its objectives in the pricing dispute%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Macourt appreciated that Telstra thought that the price paid by Foxtel to Fox Sports under the %%sqt%% interim %%sqt%% arrangements was unreasonably high ]^[ represented%%lst%% in effect%%lst%% a transfer of profits from Foxtel to Fox Sports%%per%%]$~ 
~$[He also appreciated that Telstra wished to invoke the Umbrella Agreement to force News to accept a lower price ]f[ Fox Sports by demonstrating that the price %%cmp_t%% charged to Foxtel was unreasonably high ]^[ thus in breach of the Umbrella Agreement%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Telstra was seeking to use the availability of C7 as a content supplier to Foxtel as a basis ]f[ arguing that the price under the interim arrangement was unreasonable ]f[ the purposes of the Umbrella Agreement%%lst%% ]^[ %%cmp_tf%% should be lowered%%per%% 
2704 The disinclination of Foxtel%%lst%% through Foxtel Management%%lst%% to negotiate ]f[ the carriage of C7 on the Foxtel Service does ]n[ mean that %%cmp_if%% such negotiations had taken place%%lst%% the terms proposed by C7 on 9 June 1999 would have been acceptable to%%lst%% ]v[ accepted by%%lst%% Foxtel%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Mockridge regarded a number of features of C7%%sqt%%s proposal to be unacceptable%%per%%]$~ 
~$[This was unacceptable to Mr Mockridge %%cmp_b%% he thought that such an option would give Seven a strategic advantage in the parties%%sqt%% negotiations with the AFL%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In particular%%lst%% Mr Mockridge understood the pricing to be higher %%cmp_ta%% that paid by Austar ]f[ the same service%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In addition%%lst%% the 9 June 1999 term sheet provided that C7 would use its best endeavours to rebrand the C7 channels on the Foxtel Service%%per%%]$~ 
~$[This represented a retreat from the earlier commitment by Seven%%lst%% a retreat made necessary by Optus%%sqt%% unwillingness to consent to the rebranding%%per%% 
2705 Foxtel%%sqt%%s unwillingness to negotiate in relation to C7%%sqt%%s 9 June 1999 term sheet is a component in Seven%%sqt%%s case that Foxtel%%lst%% during the period from 9 June 1999 until the end of December 2000%%lst%% determined ]n[ to negotiate with C7 ]f[ the carriage of its channels on the Foxtel Service%%per%%]$~ 
~$[I shall consider that aspect of Seven%%sqt%%s case shortly%%per%%]$~ 
~$[However%%lst%% I do ]n[ think that Seven has made out%%lst%% as a separate cause of action%%lst%% its pleaded case that Foxtel%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%in refusing to accept the offer [of 9 June 1999 took] advantage of its substantial degree of power in the retail pay television market%%sqt%% (par 407(3))%%per%% 
2706 The pleaded case concerning this cause of action is that Foxtel%%lst%% %%cmp_if%% it had faced significant competition from other pay television service providers%%lst%% would have accepted the offer ]s[ that it could obtain the additional subscribers who would be attracted by C7%%sqt%%s channels ]^[ the additional revenue which would result (par 407(a))%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Assuming the term sheet of 9 June 1999 was an offer capable of acceptance (in the sense used in the Statement of Claim)%%lst%% Seven has ]n[ shown that in a more competitive market Foxtel would have accepted that offer%%per%% 
2707 I put to one side Mr Mockridge%%sqt%%s (genuine) concerns that C7%%sqt%%s proposed option to renew the supply agreement would give it an advantage in the bidding ]f[ the AFL pay television rights%%lst%% since Seven%%sqt%%s position is that Foxtel%%sqt%%s capacity to deny C7 a negotiating advantage was itself a manifestation ]^[ exercise of Foxtel%%sqt%%s market power%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The rest of Foxtel%%sqt%%s concerns%%lst%% especially as to price ]^[ the supply of exclusively live games%%lst%% would have remained in a competitive market%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Had further negotiations taken place%%lst%% assuming competitive market conditions%%lst%% Foxtel would ]n[ have accepted C7%%sqt%%s proposal without substantial modification%%per%%]$~ 
~$[An agreement on different terms ultimately might have been reached%%per%%]$~ 
~$[But that is ]n[ sufficient to make out Seven%%sqt%%s pleaded case%%per%% 
2708 I appreciate that Seven contends that it is necessary to ascertain why Foxtel refused to accept the offer%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It submits that %%cmp_if%% the refusal was ]f[ reasons that would ]n[ have been rational in a competitive market%%lst%% it does ]n[ matter that Foxtel could ]v[ would have rejected the offer ]f[ other reasons%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In these circumstances%%lst%% Foxtel would still have taken advantage of its market power ]f[ (so Seven says) one of the proscribed purposes%%per%% 
2709 There are two answers to this contention%%per%%]$~ 
~$[First%%lst%% Seven%%lst%% by its pleading%%lst%% has taken upon itself to prove that %%cmp_if%% Foxtel had faced significant competition from other pay television service providers%%lst%% it would have accepted the offer%%per%%]$~ 
~$[This was the basis on which the case was fought ]^[ explains why the Respondents focussed on the unacceptable features of the %%sqt%% offer %%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Seven has ]n[ made out the case it has attempted to prove%%per%% 
2710 The second is that%%lst%% as I have already noted%%lst%% Foxtel%%sqt%%s refusal to negotiate in relation to the 9 June 1999 letter is a component in Seven%%sqt%%s broader %%sqt%% refusal to deal %%sqt%% case ]^[ needs to be considered in the context of that case%%per%%]$~ 
~$[I now turn to that issue%%per%% 
16%%per%%6%%per%%2 Refusal to Deal 
16%%per%%6%%per%%2%%per%%1 SOME REFINEMENTS 
2711 Seven ]^[ the Respondents accuse each other of misrepresenting ]v[ misunderstanding their respective submissions in relation to Seven%%sqt%%s %%sqt%% refusal to deal %%sqt%% claim%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Some matters emerge from the confusion with reasonable clarity%%per%% 
2712 First%%lst%% Mr Sumption%%lst%% in his oral closing submissions%%lst%% accepted that one reason ]f[ News ]^[ PBL refusing to support the idea that Foxtel should negotiate with C7 to take its channels was their determination that negotiations should ]n[ take place until the Fox Sports pricing dispute with Telstra had been resolved%%per%%]$~ 
~$[However%%lst%% Mr Sumption contended that even %%cmp_if%% that were so%%lst%% Foxtel had taken advantage of its market power ]f[ the purpose of marginalising C7%%per%% 
2713 Secondly%%lst%% News does ]n[ dispute that%%lst%% following Foxtel Management%%sqt%%s board meeting of 8 July 1999%%lst%% Foxtel adopted a strategy of deferring any negotiations with C7 until after the AFL pay television rights ]f[ 2002 to 2006 had been dealt with%%per%%]$~ 
~$[News says that Foxtel adopted the strategy in order to give itself an advantage in bidding (through News) against Seven ]f[ the AFL pay television rights%%per%% 
2714 Thirdly%%lst%% Seven%%sqt%%s primary position is that the refusal to deal with C7 was part of a strategy designed to enable Foxtel to acquire the AFL pay television rights and%%lst%% by that means%%lst%% to destroy C7%%per%%]$~ 
~$[However%%lst%% Seven contends that%%lst%% even %%cmp_if%% News%%sqt%% %%sqt%% deferral %%sqt%% scenario is correct%%lst%% Foxtel had nonetheless used its market power%%per%%]$~ 
~$[He had also formed the view%%lst%% reflected in the AFL Strategy paper ]f[ the Foxtel Management board meeting of 8 July 1999%%lst%% that Foxtel should ]n[ consider a deal with C7 until Foxtel had concluded an agreement with the AFL ]v[ had decided that such an agreement was ]n[ feasible%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It also recommended that %%cmp_if%% Foxtel succeeded in its bid%%lst%% an interim deal should be negotiated with C7 until the end of 2001%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The latter recommendation was removed from the final version %%cmp_b%% Mr Lachlan Murdoch made it clear that News would ]n[ agree to C7 being taken on the Foxtel Service until the Fox Sports pricing dispute between News ]^[ Telstra had been resolved%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The board approved the recommendation to negotiate directly with the AFL%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It was implicit in the board%%sqt%%s endorsement of the recommendation that Foxtel would ]n[ pursue negotiations ]f[ the carriage of C7 until the outcome of the bidding process was known%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The terms of the rejection%%lst%% however%%lst%% made it clear that%%lst%% in any event%%lst%% Foxtel was ]n[ interested in taking C7 %%cmp_b%% to do ]s[ would interfere with Foxtel%%sqt%%s negotiations ]f[ the AFL pay television rights%%per%%]$~ 
~$[On the contrary%%lst%% Telstra wanted negotiations to take place in order to assist it to achieve its objective of reducing the price paid by Foxtel ]f[ Fox Sports%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Nonetheless%%lst%% by agreeing to the recommendation that Foxtel Management negotiate directly with the AFL on behalf of the Foxtel Partnership%%lst%% the Telstra representatives appreciated that there would be no negotiations with C7 pending the outcome of the bidding ]f[ the AFL pay television rights%%per%%]$~ 
~$[His reasons were explained in his evidence ([733]%%dsh%%[735])%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Falloon shared Mr Mockridge%%sqt%%s view%%lst%% as seen by his contribution to the discussion at the Foxtel Management board meeting of 8 July 1999%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In particular%%lst%% in July 1999%%lst%% the Foxtel Management board understood that the rights would be awarded by the end of that year (that is%%lst%% within a period of about five months)%%per%% 
16%%per%%6%%per%%2%%per%%3 THRESHOLD PLEADING ISSUE 
2716 A threshold issue arises in relation to Seven%%sqt%%s contention that %%cmp_if%% News ]^[ PBL decided that Foxtel should ]n[ deal with C7 until the Fox Sports pricing issue had been resolved%%lst%% that would suffice to establish that Foxtel had contravened s 46(1) of the TP Act %%per%%]$~ 
~$[Seven%%sqt%%s written submissions make no reference to this contention%%per%% 
2717 The first reference to the argument appears in Seven%%sqt%%s Case Summary%%lst%% filed after its Reply Submissions%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Paragraph 68 of the Case Summary includes the following sentence%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%Further%%lst%% on the Respondents%%sqt%% own case%%lst%% the purpose of News ]^[ PBL was to exclude C7 ]s[ as to prevent C7 from competing with Fox Sports until the resolution of a long term supply agreement between Fox Sports ]^[ Foxtel%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The Applicants say that %%cmp_if%% Foxtel proceeded on this basis this is a purpose falling within s%%per%%46(1)(c) [ASR 8%%per%%35%%dsh%%70]%%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The cross%%dsh%%reference in this sentence is to pars 8%%per%%35 to 8%%per%%70 of Seven%%sqt%%s Reply Submissions%%per%%]$~ 
~$[There is nothing in these paragraphs%%lst%% however%%lst%% that seeks to make out the argument identified in the Case Summary%%per%% 
2718 I asked Mr Sumption in his oral closing submissions what Seven%%sqt%%s position was %%cmp_if%% I were to find that a substantial reason ]f[ Foxtel%%sqt%%s refusal to deal with C7 was News%%sqt%% ]^[ PBL%%sqt%%s unwillingness to allow Foxtel to negotiate with C7 until the Fox Sports pricing dispute with Telstra had been resolved%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Sumption accepted that one of the reasons ]f[ Foxtel refusing to take C7 was News%%sqt%% desire (supported by PBL) to secure long%%dsh%%term arrangements relating to the supply of Fox Sports to the Foxtel platform%%per%%]$~ 
~$[He said that a finding to that effect%%lst%% on the basis that News was seeking to avoid competition from C7%%lst%% would be enough of itself ]f[ Seven to succeed in its claim under s 46(1) of the TP Act %%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Sumption acknowledged that%%lst%% %%cmp_if%% this claim succeeded%%lst%% the measure of damages would be smaller %%cmp_ta%% Seven%%sqt%%s claims ]f[ the %%sqt%% whole scheme %%sqt%%%%per%% 
2719 In response to my inquiry as to whether a case to this effect had been pleaded%%lst%% Mr Sumption initially said he was unsure%%per%%]$~ 
~$[He later submitted that the pleading of the cause of action under s 46 of the TP Act covered the case sought to be made in par 68 of Seven%%sqt%%s Case Summary%%per%%]$~ 
~$[This was ]s[ %%cmp_b%% the Statement of Claim (par 414) alleged that %%sqt%% Foxtel %%sqt%% had taken advantage of its power in the retail pay television market ]f[ the purpose of deterring ]v[ preventing C7 from engaging in competitive conduct in the wholesale sports channel market ]^[ the wholesale channel market%%per%% 
2720 Mr Sumption%%sqt%%s response prompted a protest from Mr Hutley that no s 46 case had been pleaded that Foxtel had refused to take C7 %%cmp_b%% News ]^[ PBL had refused to support negotiations with C7 until the Fox Sports pricing issue had been resolved%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Hutley%%lst%% in his closing submissions%%lst%% contended that the Statement of Claim did ]n[ cover the argument Seven had belatedly raised ]^[ that the Respondents would be prejudiced by any application to amend the pleadings at such a late stage%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In the event%%lst%% Seven made no application to amend further the Statement of Claim%%per%% 
2721 In my view the pleadings do ]n[ cover the contention identified by Seven in par 68 of its Case Summary%%per%%]$~ 
~$[There is no express reference in the pleadings%%lst%% ]v[ (so far as I am aware) in any particulars%%lst%% to the Foxtel Partnership resolving ]n[ to negotiate with C7 %%cmp_b%% of the Fox Sports pricing issue%%per%%]$~ 
~$[This is ]n[ surprising%%lst%% %%cmp_b%% the primary focus of Seven%%sqt%%s case from the beginning has been that %%sqt%% Foxtel %%sqt%% (meaning Sky Cable ]^[ Telstra Media as partners in the Foxtel Partnership) determined ]n[ to deal with C7 at any time ]v[ on any terms ]^[ that this was an element of the conduct of the Foxtel Partnership engaged in ]f[ the purpose of destroying C7 as a viable channel supplier%%per%% 
2722 The key allegation made by Seven is that during the period from 9 June 1999 until the end of December 2000%%lst%% Foxtel determined ]n[ to negotiate with C7 ]f[ the carriage of C7%%sqt%%s channels on the Foxtel Service (par 401B)%%per%%]$~ 
~$[If that allegation was intended to cover what can be described as the Fox Sports contention (that is%%lst%% that Foxtel had determined ]n[ to negotiate with C7 until the Fox Sports pricing issue had been resolved)%%lst%% it is extremely odd that the allegation is limited to the period of 18 months ending with the award of the AFL pay television rights to Foxtel%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The Fox Sports pricing issue was ]n[ resolved between the Foxtel partners until many months after December 2000%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The dispute %%cmp_tf%% constituted an impediment to Foxtel taking the C7 channels well beyond December 2000%%per%% 
2723 More importantly%%lst%% the allegation made by Seven is that Foxtel (Sky Cable ]^[ Telstra Media carrying on business as partners under the name %%sqt%% Foxtel %%sqt%%) determined ]n[ to negotiate with C7%%per%%]$~ 
~$[No allegation is made that News ]v[ PBL (or%%lst%% ]f[ that matter%%lst%% Sky Cable) separately made that determination%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It is abundantly clear that Telstra did ]n[ share the view of News ]^[ PBL that the Foxtel Partnership should ]n[ negotiate with C7 until the Fox Sports pricing issue had been resolved%%per%% 
2724 If the Statement of Claim was intended to embrace the Fox Sports contention%%lst%% the pleading should have alleged the material facts necessary to demonstrate that Foxtel determined ]n[ to negotiate with C7 until the Fox Sports pricing dispute had been resolved%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In the absence of the material facts being identified%%lst%% it is quite unclear how the pleaded %%sqt%% determination %%sqt%% can be sheeted home to each of the Foxtel partners%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Is it %%cmp_b%% Sky Cable (or News ]^[ PBL through Sky Cable) exercised its veto power%%qsn%%]$~ 
~$[If so%%lst%% precisely how was this a decision of the Foxtel Partnership%%qsn%%]$~ 
~$[What is Telstra Media alleged to have done in relation to the Fox Sports pricing issue? 
2725 If Seven intended to rely on the Fox Sports contention only against Sky Cable (or against News ]^[ PBL)%%lst%% the Statement of Claim should have spelled out how Sky Cable took advantage of its market power to prevent Foxtel dealing with C7%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In particular%%lst%% %%cmp_if%% Seven wished to make out a case based on something other %%cmp_ta%% a %%sqt%% determination %%sqt%% of Foxtel%%lst%% that something should have been precisely identified%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Sky Cable ]^[ Telstra Media (and News%%lst%% PBL ]^[ Telstra) were entitled to be told the case they had to meet%%per%%]$~ 
~$[They were also entitled to conduct the proceedings on the basis that Seven%%sqt%%s case was bounded by a fair reading of the Statement of Claim%%per%% 
2726 It follows that%%lst%% in the absence of any application to amend the pleadings (which doubtless would have been vigorously opposed)%%lst%% Seven cannot rely on the Fox Sports contention as an independent basis ]f[ establishing its pleaded cause of action under s 46(1) of the TP Act %%per%% 
16%%per%%6%%per%%2%%per%%4 WHAT DID FOXTEL FOREGO? 
2727 In view of the findings I have made ]^[ the pleading issue I have identified%%lst%% Seven%%sqt%%s case based on Foxtel%%sqt%%s refusal to deal with C7 essentially rests on the determination by Foxtel ]n[ to negotiate with C7 until the AFL pay television rights had been awarded%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Seven contends that in making this determination%%lst%% Foxtel forewent the opportunity to fill the last significant gap in its sports programming line%%dsh%%up ]f[ a period of two ]^[ a half years%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Seven also contends that Foxtel (through Foxtel Management) knew that the C7 channels could be obtained ]f[ the Foxtel platform on terms that would be %%sqt%% very profitable %%sqt%% ]f[ Foxtel%%per%% 
2728 Seven considerably overstates the first of these contentions%%per%%]$~ 
~$[As I have previously pointed out%%lst%% the Statement of Claim alleges%%lst%% ]f[ the purposes of Seven%%sqt%%s s 46(1) cause of action%%lst%% that Foxtel determined ]n[ to negotiate with C7 in the period from 9 June 1999 until the end of December 2000%%per%%]$~ 
~$[No allegation is made in this context of a determination ]n[ to negotiate during any period after December 2000%%per%% 
(There is an allegation in par 198(2)(p) of the Statement of Claim%%lst%% in quite a different context%%lst%% that the Foxtel Partnership refused to take C7 from November 1998 until December 2001%%per%%]$~ 
~$[However%%lst%% this allegation is ]n[ incorporated into the pleaded cause of action under s 46(1) of the TP Act%%per%% 
) 
2729 In any event%%lst%% the facts do ]n[ support Seven%%sqt%%s contention that Foxtel understood that refusing to negotiate with C7 pending allocation of the AFL pay television rights would deprive the Foxtel platform of highly desirable sporting content ]f[ a period of two ]^[ a half years%%per%%]$~ 
~$[On the pleadings ]^[ on the findings I have made%%lst%% Seven is in effect limited to a claim that Foxtel decided ]n[ to negotiate with C7 %%cmp_b%% a refusal to negotiate would have enhanced Foxtel%%sqt%%s prospects of successfully bidding against Seven ]f[ the AFL pay television rights%%per%% 
2730 In July 1999%%lst%% when Mr Mockridge suggested direct negotiations with the AFL%%lst%% he ]^[ the members of the Foxtel Management board thought that the award of the AFL pay television rights would be finalised by the end of 1999%%per%%]$~ 
~$[As I have found%%lst%% at any given time between June 1999 ]^[ December 2000%%lst%% the AFL%%sqt%%s decision was thought to be no more %%cmp_ta%% five ]v[ six months away%%lst%% %%cmp_if%% that%%per%%]$~ 
~$[For example%%lst%% Mr Mockridge told the Foxtel Management board at the 7 February 2000 meeting that the AFL wanted to deal with the rights within the next two months%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Mockridge ]^[ representatives of the Foxtel partners thought that the decision ]n[ to negotiate with C7 until the AFL awarded the pay television rights would deprive the Foxtel platform of AFL content ]f[ no more %%cmp_ta%% a few more months%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Once the rights had been awarded%%lst%% there was no impediment to discussions with C7 (other %%cmp_ta%% News ]^[ PBL%%sqt%%s wish that the Fox Sports pricing issue should be resolved)%%per%% 
2732 Seven acknowledges that Mr Mockridge annotated Mr Freudenstein%%sqt%%s models to the effect that the assumed take up rate of 20 per cent on a tier (the most conservative of the assumptions utilised by Mr Freudenstein) was %%sqt%% too high%%scn%% particularly with cannibalisation %%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Seven also acknowledges that the ten year model did ]n[ take into account the MSGs incorporated into C7%%sqt%%s 16 April 1999 %%sqt%% offer %%sqt%%%%lst%% ]b[ points out that this model assumed a 10 per cent take%%dsh%%up rate%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Seven nonetheless says that the models indicate that C7 would have been profitable ]f[ Foxtel%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Indeed%%lst%% Seven contends%%lst%% by reference to an analysis of the models ]^[ the terms of C7%%sqt%%s 16 April 1999 letter%%lst%% that Foxtel%%sqt%%s %%sqt%% adjusted profit %%sqt%% from the carriage of C7 would have been somewhere between $1%%per%%98 million ]^[ $3%%per%%53 million per annum over the years 2000 to 2003%%per%%

~$[The final version recorded%%lst%% by reference to C7%%sqt%%s 9 June 1999 letter%%lst%% that Foxtel would require a tier penetration of 23 per cent to break even %%cmp_if%% it was to carry C7%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Mockridge%%lst%% whose evidence I accept%%lst%% confirmed in evidence that at the time he regarded Mr Freudenstein%%sqt%%s most conservative take%%dsh%%up assumptions (that is%%lst%% a tier penetration rate of 20 per cent) as unacceptably optimistic%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It is also true%%lst%% as News points out%%lst%% that Mr Freudenstein%%sqt%%s models did ]n[ precisely adopt the terms offered by C7 and%%lst%% in some respects%%lst%% assumed terms more favourable %%cmp_ta%% those put forward by C7%%per%% 
2734 News submits that the board of Foxtel Management%%lst%% which had the benefit of Mr Mockridge%%sqt%%s views ]b[ ]n[ of Mr Freudenstein%%sqt%%s%%lst%% cannot be regarded as having foregone any opportunity to make a profit out of the carriage of C7%%per%%]$~ 
~$[On the contrary%%lst%% News contends that Foxtel was ]n[ foregoing anything of value by deferring consideration of taking C7 on the Foxtel platform until after the bidding ]f[ the AFL pay television rights had been resolved%%per%% 
2735 News%%sqt%% submissions seem to me to understate somewhat the perceived value to Foxtel of taking the C7 channels during the period 1999 to 2000%%lst%% pending the award of the AFL pay television rights%%per%%]$~ 
~$[By the same token%%lst%% I think that Seven%%sqt%%s submissions substantially overstate the perceived benefits%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Seven%%sqt%%s assessment gives insufficient weight to Mr Mockridge%%sqt%%s genuine scepticism about the assumptions incorporated into the models%%lst%% which he conveyed to the Foxtel Management board%%per%% 
2736 The decision by the Foxtel Management board ]n[ to consider taking the C7 channels until the AFL pay television rights had been awarded was seen at the time by the representatives of News ]^[ PBL as likely to involve some costs to Foxtel%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In my view%%lst%% Mr Mockridge ]^[ representatives of the Foxtel partners must have understood that Foxtel%%lst%% by declining to deal with C7%%lst%% was foregoing an opportunity to derive some profits from the carriage of the C7 channels pending the award of the AFL pay television rights%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In addition%%lst%% they would have understood that Foxtel would probably secure some advantages from the Foxtel Service filling its one remaining premium sports %%sqt%% gap %%sqt%% sooner rather %%cmp_ta%% later%%per%%

~$[The decision left it open to Foxtel%%lst%% %%cmp_if%% it succeeded in its bid ]f[ the AFL pay television rights%%lst%% to take the C7 channels from a time very shortly after the AFL awarded the rights until the commencement of the new rights period in 2002 (by which time C7 would no longer be able to supply AFL content)%%per%% 
2738 The Foxtel Management board ]^[ Mr Mockridge believed that the costs to Foxtel (including opportunities foregone) of ]n[ taking the C7 channels%%lst%% pending the award of the AFL pay television rights%%lst%% were very modest%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In my opinion%%lst%% any fair assessment of the likely profits foregone (bearing in mind that the Foxtel Partnership was understood to be depriving itself of the C7 channels ]f[ only a short period) would ]n[ have exceeded $500,000 to $750,000%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The intangible benefits foregone by ]n[ taking the C7 channels ]f[ a short period would have been of little consequence to Foxtel%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Having regard to what the representatives of Foxtel ]^[ the Foxtel partners thought was at stake in the bidding ]f[ the AFL pay television rights%%lst%% the costs of ]n[ negotiating with C7 pending the outcome of the bidding contest were minor%%per%% 
2739 The question is whether%%lst%% in these circumstances%%lst%% the conduct of Foxtel in refusing to deal with C7 until the AFL awarded the pay television rights was materially facilitated by Foxtel%%sqt%%s substantial degree of power in the retail pay television market%%per%%]$~ 
~$[This requires consideration of whether Foxtel could have acted in the same way in a competitive market%%per%%]$~ 
~$[As the authorities establish%%lst%% this does ]n[ mean a perfectly competitive market%%lst%% ]b[ a hypothetical market in which there is a sufficient level of competition to ensure that no participant has a substantial degree of power in the market%%per%% 
2742 So far as the last point is concerned%%lst%% in a competitive market it is true that Foxtel would have faced competitive pressures to take subscription%%dsh%%driving AFL content%%lst%% whether ]v[ ]n[ it acquired the AFL pay television rights directly from the AFL%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Similarly%%lst%% there would have been competitive pressures on other retail pay television platforms to take AFL content from Foxtel%%lst%% should it have acquired the AFL pay television rights%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The AFL would %%cmp_tf%% have been likely to conclude that%%lst%% whoever won the rights%%lst%% the probabilities were that AFL content would find its way on to all retail pay television platforms%%per%% 
2743 Nonetheless%%lst%% it is one thing ]f[ a bidder ]f[ the AFL pay television rights already to have secured carriage on all pay television platforms%%scn%% it is another thing ]f[ the bidder (and the AFL) to rely on future commercial negotiations to bring about that outcome on satisfactory terms%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In the former case%%lst%% the terms of carriage would be known%%lst%% even though there might be no assurance that the arrangements would continue into the new rights period%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In the latter case%%lst%% negotiations%%lst%% by hypothesis%%lst%% would take place within the constraints imposed by a competitive retail pay television market%%lst%% ]b[ they would necessarily involve some degree of uncertainty that might prove to be troubling ]f[ (in this case) the AFL%%per%%]$~ 
~$[There are many possible impediments to establishing satisfactory commercial relationships%%lst%% even %%cmp_if%% a potential buyer of sporting content is operating in a competitive market%%per%% 
2744 Whether Foxtel could have denied itself access to the C7 channels pending the outcome of the bidding process%%lst%% assuming a competitive retail pay television market%%lst%% depends on the costs it would have incurred (including the opportunities foregone) by pursuing this strategy%%lst%% %%cmp%%d with the assessed benefits of taking that course%%per%%]$~ 
~$[On the findings I have made%%lst%% the costs would have been low%%lst%% partly %%cmp_b%% the AFL%%sqt%%s decision was expected within a short period ]^[ partly %%cmp_b%% the foregone benefits that Foxtel denied itself by ]n[ taking C7 were very modest by the standards of this industry%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The benefits would no doubt have been difficult to assess precisely%%lst%% %%cmp_b%% the assessment would have involved determining the likely response of the AFL to the uncertainties of future negotiations between C7 ]^[ Foxtel%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In my view%%lst%% it would have been commercially rational ]f[ Foxtel%%lst%% assuming a competitive retail pay television market%%lst%% to have denied a competing bidder a perceived advantage in the bidding process ]f[ the AFL pay television rights %%cmp_if%% the costs of doing ]s[ were both very modest ]^[ short%%dsh%%term%%per%% 
2745 It follows that%%lst%% in my view%%lst%% Foxtel%%lst%% in refusing to deal with C7 pending the award of the AFL pay television rights%%lst%% did ]n[ take advantage of its substantial power in the retail pay television market%%per%% 
2748 News submits that the evidence does ]n[ support a finding to the effect that Foxtel made a threat to the AFL that %%cmp_if%% it did ]n[ license the pay television rights to Foxtel%%lst%% AFL matches would simply ]n[ be shown on the Foxtel platform%%per%%]$~ 
~$[According to News%%lst%% the effect of the statements made to the AFL was that%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%if the AFL sold the rights to Seven instead of FOXTEL%%lst%% %%cmp_t%% the question of whether AFL matches would appear on the FOXTEL Service would depend on the commercial uncertainties of whether FOXTEL ]^[ C7 would conclude a channel supply agreement%%sqt%%%%per%% 
2749 The difference between the respective submissions is rather fine%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The presentations made to the AFL by Mr Mockridge were all verbal%%per%%]$~ 
~$[He was taken at length to various drafts that were prepared within Foxtel Management%%lst%% some of which he annotated%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In particular%%lst%% Mr Mockridge was asked to comment on handwritten notes he made to a draft document dated 1 October 1998%%lst%% that read as follows%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%this section needs to present Austar as our ally ]^[ Fox Sports franchisee holder[%%per%%]$~ 
~$[That is,] together we have access to 400+250=650k [subscribers] gross by 20k+ a month while Optus has 180k ]^[ is static[%%per%%]$~ 
~$[That is%%lst%% the] conclusion is that C%%dsh%%7 Sports channel with Optus/Ch7 is a dead%%dsh%%end ]^[ counter%%dsh%%productive to AFL%%sqt%%s longer term distribution objective%%sqt%%%%per%% 
2750 Mr Mockridge%%sqt%%s cross%%dsh%%examination on the note was as follows%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%[MR SHEAHAN:] What you were intending to explain to the AFL was that in the long term %%cmp_if%% it did ]n[ go with Foxtel it would be stuck in a dead end on Optus with C7%%scn%% isn%%sqt%%t that right? 
%%dsh%%%%dsh%%%%dsh%% That%%sqt%%s the proposition%%per%%]$~ 
~$[That was your view in October 1998%%lst%% was it not? 
%%dsh%%%%dsh%%%%dsh%% That was my view in preparing this submission to the AFL%%lst%% yes%%per%% 
%%per%%%%per%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The two answers you have previously given carry with them that your view was that C7 would ]n[ be on Foxtel even %%cmp_if%% it had the AFL? 
%%dsh%%%%dsh%%%%dsh%% I think in terms of this presentation that is the implication of that remark%%lst%% yes%%per%%]$~ 
~$[And in terms of your view in preparing the submission to the AFL? 
%%dsh%%%%dsh%%%%dsh%% I think I make a distinction between the submission ]^[ what my position might have been in regard to C7%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Just to be quite clear about this%%lst%% you were intending to try to create the impression in the AFL that C7 would ]n[ be taken by Foxtel even %%cmp_if%% it had the AFL rights%%lst%% ]b[ that was ]n[ necessarily your view in fact? 
%%dsh%%%%dsh%%%%dsh%% Correct%%per%%]$~ 
~$[An approach you were quite comfortable with? 
%%dsh%%%%dsh%%%%dsh%% Yes%%sqt%%%%per%% 
2751 Mr Mockridge made the point in his evidence that his views had evolved over time ]^[ that the contents of drafts did ]n[ necessarily reflect the terms of any of his oral presentations to the AFL%%per%%]$~ 
~$[He also made the point that the AFL was a sophisticated negotiator ]^[ was hardly likely to believe that%%lst%% %%cmp_if%% Seven succeeded in obtaining the AFL pay television rights%%lst%% Foxtel would simply refuse to negotiate with C7%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Understandably enough%%lst%% however%%lst%% Mr Mockridge could ]n[ remember the precise contents of his conversations with the AFL%%per%% 
2752 In my view%%lst%% it is unlikely that Mr Mockridge said unequivocally that Foxtel would ]n[ take C7 even %%cmp_if%% Seven obtained the AFL pay television rights%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It seems to me quite plausible that Mr Mockridge would have assessed that his AFL audience was sophisticated enough to take such an unvarnished assertion with more %%cmp_ta%% a grain of salt%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Rather%%lst%% the likelihood is that Mr Mockridge would have implied that Foxtel would be quite prepared ]n[ to take C7%%lst%% leaving it unclear whether this would come about %%cmp_b%% of a blanket refusal to deal with C7 ]v[ simply %%cmp_b%% of the parties%%sqt%% likely inability to come to commercial terms%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The fact that the AFL documents do ]n[ record any unequivocal statement that Foxtel would ]n[ take C7%%lst%% even %%cmp_if%% Seven obtained the AFL broadcasting rights%%lst%% tends to support this interpretation of Mr Mockridge%%sqt%%s position%%per%% 
2753 The precise information conveyed by Mr Mockridge to the AFL does ]n[ seem to me to be of crucial significance %%cmp_b%% a more ]v[ less verbatim record is available of a presentation made to the AFL by Mr Blomfield in the company of Mr Lachlan Murdoch%%lst%% Mr Campbell ]^[ others%%lst%% on 9 May 2000%%per%% 
(This was after Mr Mockridge had ceased to be CEO of Foxtel Management in February 2000%%per%% 
) I have already referred to the presentation ([893])%%lst%% which included the following%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%In the interests of the game%%lst%% Foxtel will ]n[ seek PAY TV exclusivity of Network AFL%%per%%]$~ 
~$[We propose the channel will also be sold to Austar ]^[ Optus TV ]f[ an agreed per subscriber figure%%per%%]$~

~$[Lets [sic] be quite frank here %%dsh%% even %%cmp_if%% the Government legislates that Telstra [C]able is available to other channel providers%%lst%% that does ]n[ mean that it is a FOXTEL channel%%per%%]$~

(Emphasis added%%per%% 
) 
2754 There was a calculated ambiguity about Mr Blomfield%%sqt%%s presentation%%per%%]$~ 
~$[He did ]n[ state explicitly that Foxtel would ]n[ deal with C7%%lst%% ]b[ he implied that C7 would find it extremely difficult%%lst%% ]f[ one reason ]v[ another%%lst%% to get onto the Foxtel platform even %%cmp_if%% Seven succeeded in its bid%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In substance%%lst%% he was content to convey the impression that %%cmp_if%% the AFL wanted AFL content to be broadcast on every platform%%lst%% it could achieve that result with certainty only by awarding the AFL pay television rights to Foxtel%%per%% 
2755 That this was the substance of the message conveyed to the AFL ]^[ understood by it is supported by a paper prepared ]f[ the AFL%%sqt%%s Broadcast Negotiating Committee on 30 May 2000%%lst%% three weeks after Mr Blomfield%%sqt%%s presentation%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The paper assessed the strengths ]^[ weaknesses of Seven%%sqt%%s proposals%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Among the strengths was the existence of a direct relationship between a free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air operator ]^[ a pay television operator (suggesting that the AFL saw benefits in a single entity ]v[ a joint venture controlling all AFL broadcasting rights)%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The recorded weaknesses of Seven%%sqt%%s proposal included the following%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%C7 continues to struggle to win Market Share%%per%%]$~ 
~$[There is no guarantee to end up on Foxtel%%sqt%%%%per%% 
2756 This internal assessment indicates that the AFL did ]n[ understand that Foxtel had asserted that C7 would ]n[ be taken on the Foxtel platform even %%cmp_if%% Seven won the AFL pay television rights%%per%% 
(An alternative%%lst%% although I think less probable%%lst%% explanation is that the AFL understood Foxtel to have made such a threat%%lst%% ]b[ the AFL did ]n[ take the threat literally in view of its perception of the realities of the marketplace%%per%% 
) The AFL understood that there could be no guarantee that C7 would be on the Foxtel platform%%lst%% since that outcome depended on successful negotiations between the parties once the AFL pay television rights had been awarded%%per%% 
2757 It follows that Seven has ]n[ made out its pleaded case that representatives of Foxtel told the AFL that C7 would ]n[ be given the opportunity to broadcast its channels on the Foxtel platform%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In any event%%lst%% ]f[ much the same reasons as I have given in relation to Foxtel%%sqt%%s refusal to deal with C7 pending the award of the AFL pay television rights%%lst%% I do ]n[ think that Foxtel%%sqt%%s making of the statements to the AFL was materially facilitated by its substantial degree of power in the retail pay television market%%per%%]$~ 
~$[If the market had been competitive%%lst%% Foxtel could rationally have made the statements it did in order to capitalise on the uncertainty as to whether C7 would be taken by the Foxtel platform once the AFL pay television rights had been awarded%%per%% 
16%%per%%6%%per%%3%%per%%2 RELIEF 
2758 If this conclusion is wrong and%%lst%% in making the statements to the AFL%%lst%% Foxtel took advantage of its market power in contravention of s 46 of the TP Act%%lst%% an issue arises as to whether Seven is entitled to any relief in respect of that contravention%%per%% 
2759 As I have noted%%lst%% one of the difficulties in a large ]^[ complex case such as this is that submissions as to liability ]^[ relief may have to be made without the parties (or the Court) having the benefit of findings of fact%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The possible combinations ]^[ permutations in this case are virtually limitless%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It is %%cmp_tf%% ]n[ surprising that Seven does ]n[ appear to have specifically addressed the question of what relief%%lst%% %%cmp_if%% any%%lst%% should flow from a finding that Foxtel%%sqt%%s conduct in making statements to the AFL contravened s 46(1) of the TP Act %%per%%

~$[They include C7 being prevented from acquiring the AFL pay television rights (par 468)%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It may be that Seven intends to assert that%%lst%% %%cmp_if%% the relevant statements had ]n[ been made to the AFL%%lst%% Seven%%sqt%%s bid ]f[ the AFL broadcasting rights (including the pay television rights) would ]v[ might have succeeded%%per%% 
2761 If Seven intends to advance such a claim%%lst%% it cannot succeed%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The evidence suggests that the AFL%%sqt%%s preference ]f[ News%%sqt%% bid over that of Seven had nothing to do with the statements that were made to the AFL%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It is true that the paper prepared ]f[ the AFL%%sqt%%s Broadcasting Negotiating Committee in May 2000 recorded that there was no guarantee that C7 would end up on Foxtel%%per%%]$~ 
~$[However%%lst%% there is nothing in the later AFL documentation assessing the competing bids which suggests that the statements played any part in the final decision to award the pay television rights to Foxtel (through News)%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Indeed%%lst%% there is nothing in the AFL%%sqt%%s contemporaneous records to suggest that%%lst%% as the time ]f[ awarding the rights came closer%%lst%% the AFL thought that Foxtel would ]n[ take the C7 channels %%cmp_if%% Seven succeeded in its bid%%per%% 
2762 On the contrary%%lst%% Seven%%sqt%%s bid failed %%cmp_b%% the AFL considered that News was offering a much higher price ]^[ that the other terms of its bid were satisfactory%%per%%]$~ 
~$[As I have found in Chapter 8%%lst%% Seven put itself out of the running by ]n[ making its best bid ]f[ the AFL pay television rights and%%lst%% in that sense%%lst%% was the author of its own misfortune%%per%%]$~

~$[According to Seven%%lst%% the letter of 13 December 2000 conveyed to the NRL Partnership the proposition that Foxtel would ]n[ carry C7 even %%cmp_if%% Seven won the NRL pay television rights%%per%%

17%%per%%5 An Important Finding 
2795 Mr Gammell said in his written statement that%%lst%% following Mr Mounter%%sqt%%s departure from Seven in July 1999%%lst%% he became increasingly involved in implementing Seven%%sqt%%s pay television strategy%%lst%% including negotiating wholesale ]^[ retail access issues with Foxtel%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Gammell acknowledged that C7%%sqt%%s primary business was as a wholesale sports channel provider%%lst%% ]b[ said this%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%Notwithstanding that the primary business model was to operate as a wholesale channel provider%%lst%% by mid 1999 I was becoming increasingly concerned that C7 was unlikely to obtain wholesale access to Foxtel%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In ]v[ about mid 1999%%lst%% in consultation with others including Mr Stokes ]^[ Mr Wise%%lst%% Seven Network developed a retail access strategy%%per%%]$~ 
~$[I considered that C7 could%%lst%% given its existing wholesale arrangements with Optus ]^[ Austar%%lst%% potentially in the alternative to wholesale access to Foxtel%%lst%% offer its sports channels on a retail basis%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Accordingly%%lst%% I considered that C7 should offer its sports channels directly to viewers on the [Telstra] [C]able%%lst%% by seeking access to the [Telstra] [C]able under the access regime in the [TP] Act%%per%%]$~ 
~$[I considered%%lst%% however%%lst%% that this could only be done in conjunction with a continuation of the wholesale supply to Optus ]^[ Austar%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The existence of wholesale access arrangements with Optus ]^[ Austar gave C7 a revenue base to largely cover the cost of production ]^[ obtaining rights%%per%%]$~ 
~$[I considered that such a revenue base was essential given the likely additional ]^[ extensive costs of establishing a retail Pay TV presence ]f[ C7%%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In cross%%dsh%%examination%%lst%% Mr Gammell said that he was a member of a committee that had been established by Mr Stokes%%lst%% in effect as an advisory committee to him as the CEO of Seven%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Gammell agreed that he had taken on this role at Mr Stokes%%sqt%% request%%per%% 
2796 It will be recalled that Ms Lowes advised her colleagues at Telstra that her view%%lst%% based on conversations with Mr Gammell%%lst%% was that C7%%sqt%%s efforts to secure retail access via the Telstra Cable were really designed to pressure Foxtel to take the C7 channels%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The significance of Ms Lowes%%sqt%% understanding of Seven%%sqt%%s position lies in Mr Gammell%%sqt%%s responses when he was asked about his conversations with Ms Lowes%%per%%]$~ 
~$[His evidence was as follows%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%[MR HUTLEY:] Now%%lst%% you spoke to Ms Lowes about Seven%%sqt%%s application ]f[ access to the cable from time to time throughout 1999%%scn%% correct? 
%%dsh%%%%dsh%%%%dsh%% Yes%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Do you recall telling her that Seven were ]n[ looking ]f[ separate access to the cable ]b[ merely saw it as a way to push their way into Foxtel ]v[ words to that effect? 
%%dsh%%%%dsh%%%%dsh%% Something similar I would have imagined%%lst%% yes%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Do you recall during conversations from time to time telling her Seven wasn%%sqt%%t interested in retail access ]b[ saw it as part of their strategy in relation to convincing the government to alter its attitude to multi%%dsh%%channelling? 
%%dsh%%%%dsh%%%%dsh%% Along those lines%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Not quite in those words%%lst%% ]b[ yes%%per%%]$~ 
~$[You see%%lst%% throughout 1999 in your discussions with Ms Lowes you made it perfectly clear that the application ]f[ access which was made by Seven was a tactic to achieve possibly two strategic objects%%scn%% correct? 
%%dsh%%%%dsh%%%%dsh%% No%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The objects%%lst%% were they not%%lst%% were either a deal ]f[ the supply of C7 to Foxtel%%scn%% that was one%%lst%% correct?

~$[And you told her you had no interest in running a retail business%%scn%% correct? 
%%dsh%%%%dsh%%%%dsh%% No%%per%%]$~

~$[You say you wished to run a retail business to Ms Lowes?

~$[And you certainly told Ms Lowes it was a tactic to advance your position in relation to lobbying the government ]f[ multi%%dsh%%channelling%%scn%% correct? 
%%dsh%%%%dsh%%%%dsh%% Yes%%sqt%%%%per%% 
2797 It will be seen that Mr Gammell acknowledged that he told Ms Lowes words to the effect that Seven was ]n[ interested in retail access%%lst%% ]b[ saw it as part of the twofold strategy to get on to Foxtel ]^[ to persuade the Government to alter its stance on multi%%dsh%%channelling%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Nonetheless%%lst%% he claimed that%%lst%% although it was ]n[ Seven%%sqt%%s preference to run a retail business%%lst%% Seven was prepared to do ]s[ ]^[ he had told Mr Lowes that%%per%%]$~ 
~$[This prompted me to ask Mr Gammell ]f[ clarification of his position%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%HIS HONOUR%%cln%% Mr Gammell%%lst%% how is the notion of it being a pressure tactic to achieve another objective consistent with a desire to conduct a retail Pay TV network? 
%%dsh%%%%dsh%%%%dsh%% The way we regarded it%%lst%% your Honour%%lst%% was that we had to have more subscribers%%lst%% %%cmp_if%% we could ]n[ get them via wholesale we would do it via retail%%lst%% ]b[ it would ]n[ have been our preference%%per%%]$~ 
~$[But %%cmp_if%% there was no other choice%%lst%% you have to make do with what you can do%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Sorry%%lst%% my question was how do you reconcile your agreement that you told Ms Lowes that the request ]f[ access was%%lst%% I think your words were %%dqt%%pressure tactic%%dqt%% in order to achieve another objective with your statement that%%lst%% nonetheless%%lst%% Seven intended to operate a retail Pay TV network? 
%%dsh%%%%dsh%%%%dsh%% Because%%lst%% to our way of thinking%%lst%% Foxtel would ultimately think it would be preferable to enter into a wholesale access agreement with us %%cmp_ta%% to have a competitor on a retail access basis who would ]n[ have the same intention with their %%dsh%%%%dsh%%%%dsh%% I mean%%lst%% they would be at risk of losing their customers on their cable to another retail access provider%%per%%]$~ 
~$[You are saying%%lst%% are you%%lst%% that it was a pressure tactic in the sense that your preferred option was to persuade Foxtel to come to the party but%%lst%% %%cmp_if%% it didn%%sqt%%t%%lst%% you would nonetheless operate a retail Pay TV network? 
%%dsh%%%%dsh%%%%dsh%% Yes%%lst%% your Honour%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Is that what you are saying? 
%%dsh%%%%dsh%%%%dsh%% Yes%%lst%% your Honour%%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Gammell %%cmp_t%% attempted%%lst%% unconvincingly in my view%%lst%% to backtrack from his evidence as to what he had said to Ms Lowes%%per%% 
2798 Mr Stokes acknowledged that he knew Mr Gammell had met with Ms Lowes around August ]v[ September 1999%%per%%]$~ 
~$[However%%lst%% he denied that Mr Gammell had told him what he (Mr Gammell) had conveyed to Ms Lowes about Seven%%sqt%%s objectives%%per%%]$~

~$[An example of this strategy is the use Mr Stokes made of his letter of 12 May 2000 to Mr Blomfield%%lst%% in which he threatened to take the %%sqt%% road of forced access %%per%%%%per%%%%per%% %%cmp_if%% we are compelled to %%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Stokes sent a copy of the letter to Dr Switkowski in order (as Mr Stokes said in evidence) to alert him to the issues that it raised%%lst%% including the possibility that Telstra would be sued ]f[ any delay in C7 gaining access to the Foxtel platform%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Stokes agreed that the object was to concentrate Telstra%%sqt%%s mind %%sqt%% on endeavouring to secure Foxtel to agree to a commercial deal to take the C7 channels %%sqt%%%%per%%

2801 The significance of the absence of any planning within Seven ]f[ the conduct of a retail pay television business is reinforced by Seven%%sqt%%s internal communications%%per%%]$~ 
~$[On 30 October 2000%%lst%% Ms Rothery advised Mr Gammell of the need ]f[ Seven to obtain expert advice ]f[ the forthcoming ACCC arbitration%%per%%]$~ 
~$[She thought that an expert was needed to plot the %%sqt%% various possible ways of getting the C7 signal to the cable %%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[She also thought that information was needed on how Seven could set up a separate subscriber billing system %%cmp_if%% the ACCC would ]n[ agree to Seven using Foxtel%%sqt%%s system%%per%% 
2802 It is difficult to resist the conclusion that%%lst%% %%cmp_if%% Mr Stokes ]^[ Mr Gammell had been serious about utilising access to the Telstra Cable%%lst%% Seven would have addressed the issues posed by Ms Rothery very much earlier%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Stokes accepted that%%lst%% as at May 2000%%lst%% Seven lacked the capability to utilise access to the Telstra Cable%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It simply did ]n[ have the technical capacity%%lst%% the equipment%%lst%% the staff ]v[ the business plans to do so%%per%% 
2803 As appears from the account in Chapter 10%%lst%% the ACCC provided the impetus ]f[ Seven to develop a business plan that would be implemented %%cmp_if%% Seven gained retail access to pay television subscribers via the Telstra Cable%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The ACCC pointed out to Mr North in late March 2001 that the absence of a business plan made it impossible ]f[ the ACCC to assess the commercial impact of C7 gaining access to the Telstra Cable%%per%%]$~

~$[In my view%%lst%% what Mr Gammell told Ms Lowes was true%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Seven%%sqt%%s request ]f[ access%%lst%% ]^[ the litigation it instituted to pursue that request%%lst%% were simply designed to put pressure on Foxtel ]^[ on the Government in the manner Mr Gammell described ]s[ frankly to Ms Lowes%%per%% 
17%%per%%6 Did Giving Effect to cl 5%%per%%2 of the BCA Have the Effect of Substantially Lessening Competition? 
2805 Seven cannot succeed unless%%lst%% at the time ]v[ times that Foxtel ]^[ Telstra Multimedia gave effect to cl 5%%per%%2 of the BCA%%lst%% that provision was likely to have the effect of substantially lessening competition in a market%%per%%]$~ 
~$[On my reading of the Statement of Claim%%lst%% an essential element in Seven%%sqt%%s case is that%%lst%% had the parties to the BCA ]n[ given effect to cl 5%%per%%2%%lst%% Seven would have availed itself of retail access via the Telstra Cable%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Seven says that had C7 gained access to the Telstra Cable ]f[ its channels%%lst%% it would have provided competition to Foxtel in the retail pay television market%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Seven also says that C7%%sqt%%s role as a direct provider of pay television services to retail customers was likely to have changed the perception of the AFL ]^[ the NRL Partnership in the bidding process ]^[ thus was likely to have increased Seven%%sqt%%s chances of securing both sets of rights%%per%% 
2806 This case breaks down%%lst%% in my opinion%%lst%% %%cmp_b%% Seven never had any intention of availing itself of retail access%%lst%% even %%cmp_if%% the opportunity had become available to it well before December 2000%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It pursued the retail access claim (which it knew would be vigorously resisted) solely as a means of exerting pressure on Foxtel ]^[ Telstra in relation to the carriage of C7 on Foxtel ]^[ the multi%%dsh%%channelling issue%%per%%]$~

~$[The conduct of the parties to the BCA%%lst%% in giving effect to cl 5%%per%%2%%lst%% was %%cmp_tf%% ]n[ likely to have the effect of substantially lessening competition in any market%%per%% 
2807 Seven%%lst%% however%%lst%% also puts its case in an alternative way%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In a letter of 9 February 2005%%lst%% Seven%%sqt%%s solicitors said this to News%%sqt%% legal representatives%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%To avoid doubt%%lst%% Seven%%sqt%%s case in this regard is that %%cmp_if%% services had been made available to C7 to enable it to offer a retail service on the [Telstra] Cable%%lst%% %%cmp_t%% the AFL ]^[ the NRL Partnership would have been likely to conclude that%%lst%% by one means ]v[ another%%lst%% the C7 channels would be broadcast to people connected to the Foxtel Cable%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In those circumstances it would have been apparent to the AFL ]^[ the NRL Partnership that the C7 channels would be ]s[ broadcast%%per%%]$~ 
~$[This does ]n[ depend (as your letter appears to assume) on C7 commencing ]v[ having already commenced to provide a retail service%%sqt%%%%per%% 
2808 This theme is taken up in Seven%%sqt%%s Reply Submissions%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Seven there says that the issue%%lst%% ]s[ far as the AFL ]^[ NRL Partnership were concerned%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%was all about perception%%lst%% %%cmp_b%% Foxtel had managed to create the perception that C7 would ]n[ be carried on the Foxtel service ]^[ would ]n[ otherwise gain access to Foxtel subscribers%%per%%]$~ 
~$[That perception would have been altered in a significant respect %%cmp_if%% C7 had obtained an interim determination providing that it was entitled to obtain access%%per%%]$~ 
~$[There is no suggestion that C7 would in fact have gained access prior to the disposition of rights%%lst%% %%cmp_b%% this of course would have taken a further (possibly lengthy) period%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Contrary to [News%%sqt%%] submission %%per%%%%per%%%%per%% [Seven does] ]n[ concede %%per%%%%per%%%%per%% ]^[ indeed it is ]n[ the case%%lst%% that C7 never had any intention of obtaining retail access%%per%%]$~ 
~$[However%%lst%% [Seven] submit[s] that this issue%%lst%% given inordinate attention by the Respondents%%lst%% is irrelevant to the particular cause of action under consideration %%cmp_b%% the AFL ]^[ the NRL Partnership were dealing with the matter at a level of perception ]^[ impression%%sqt%%%%per%% 
2809 The Respondents appear to accept that this way of putting the case is within the scope of the Statement of Claim%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The fundamental difficulty with Seven%%sqt%%s alternative contention is that it assumes that Seven could have misled the AFL ]^[ the NRL Partnership as to its true intentions in relation to retail access%%per%%]$~ 
~$[If Seven never had any intention of availing itself of retail access%%lst%% it was hardly likely%%lst%% in the absence of misleading conduct%%lst%% that the perception of the AFL ]v[ the NRL Partnership would have been materially affected%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In assessing the likely effects on competition of giving effect to a particular provision%%lst%% it is ]n[ appropriate to assume%%lst%% in the counter%%dsh%%factual world%%lst%% that a party will either misrepresent its intentions%%lst%% ]v[ be successful in misleading the representee%%per%% 
2810 In any event%%lst%% Seven%%sqt%%s alternative case appears to proceed on the basis that each of the AFL ]^[ the NRL Partnership was influenced by its perception that C7 would not%%lst%% ]v[ might not%%lst%% reach Foxtel%%sqt%%s audience%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The argument assumes that the mere fact that C7 was entitled to retail access via the Telstra Cable would be enough to alter the perception regardless of whether Seven intended to avail itself of its entitlement to access%%per%%]$~ 
~$[There is no evidence to support such a heroic assumption%%per%% 
2811 A further difficulty in Seven%%sqt%%s path is that had Foxtel ]^[ Telstra Multimedia ]n[ relied on cl 5%%per%%2 of the BCA to resist C7%%sqt%%s requests ]f[ retail access via the Telstra Cable%%lst%% they certainly would have relied on other grounds to resist C7%%sqt%%s requests ]f[ access%%per%%]$~ 
~$[For example%%lst%% the letter of 9 September 2000 from Foxtel%%sqt%%s solicitors rejected Seven%%sqt%%s access requests on at least two grounds that had nothing to do with cl 5%%per%%2 of the BCA%%per%%]$~

18%%per%%3 Seven%%sqt%%s Pleadings 
2818 Seven pleads that the Foxtel%%dsh%%Optus CSA contains provisions (%%sqt%% Foxtel%%dsh%%Optus CSA Provisions %%sqt%%) to the following effect%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%(a) Optus has the right to receive ]^[ broadcast all of Foxtel%%sqt%%s channels over the period from 1 November 2002 to 31 December 2010%%per%% 
(b) If ]^[ when Optus commences providing its programs in digital format%%lst%% Optus will be obliged to receive ]^[ broadcast all of Foxtel%%sqt%%s channels%%per%% 
(c) Optus must make all of the channels which it produces (or may produce in the future) available ]f[ broadcast by Foxtel on Foxtel%%sqt%%s cable pay television service%%per%% 
(d) If Optus acquires a channel from any person other %%cmp_ta%% Foxtel%%lst%% ]^[ the channel is of the same ]v[ a similar genre of programming as a Foxtel channel%%lst%% %%cmp_t%% Optus must place that channel on a higher tier %%cmp_ta%% the Foxtel channel%%per%% 
(e) If Optus acquires any new movie ]v[ sports rights to broadcast on a pay television service supplied via cable%%lst%% it must arrange ]f[ the rights to be made available to Foxtel ]f[ broadcast on Foxtel%%sqt%%s cable pay television service%%sqt%%%%per%% 
2819 Foxtel (that is%%lst%% Sky Cable ]^[ Telstra Media carrying on the Foxtel business in partnership) ]^[ Optus have given effect to the CSA Provisions%%lst%% in that Foxtel has offered to its subscribers most of the channels formerly broadcast by Optus ]^[ Optus has offered to its subscribers most of the channels formerly broadcast by Foxtel (par 223)%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Further%%lst%% the effect ]v[ likely effect of the Foxtel%%dsh%%Optus CSA Provisions was that Foxtel ]^[ Optus would offer their retail pay television services at the same ]v[ similar prices%%lst%% being higher prices %%cmp_ta%% would have been charged in the absence of the Foxtel%%dsh%%Optus CSA (par 323)%%per%% 
2821 If Foxtel ]^[ Optus had ]n[ entered into ]^[ given effect to the Foxtel%%dsh%%Optus CSA Provisions%%lst%% Optus would have continued to offer different programming from Foxtel ]^[ would have competed on price%%lst%% quality ]^[ nature of programming (par 324)%%per%% 
2822 By reason of the matters pleaded in pars 321 to 324%%lst%% the effect ]v[ likely effect of the Foxtel%%dsh%%Optus CSA Provisions was to substantially lessen competition in the retail pay television market (par 325)%%per%% 
2824 By reason of these matters%%lst%% the purpose of the Foxtel%%dsh%%Optus CSA Provisions was to substantially lessen competition in the retail pay television market (par 325)%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Accordingly%%lst%% Foxtel ]^[ Optus engaged in conduct in contravention of s 45(2)(a)(ii) ]^[ (b)(ii) of the TP Act (pars 337%%lst%% 337A)%%per%% 
2825 The News%%lst%% Foxtel%%lst%% Telstra ]^[ Optus respondents admit%%lst%% as alleged by Seven%%lst%% that a substantial purpose of the Foxtel%%dsh%%Optus CSA was to enable both Foxtel ]^[ Optus to obtain a greater range of programming%%lst%% while lowering the cost of that programming%%per%%]$~ 
~$[However%%lst%% they otherwise deny the allegations as to the purpose of the Foxtel%%dsh%%Optus CSA Provisions made by Seven in the Statement of Claim%%per%%

2826 At the time of entering the Foxtel%%dsh%%Optus CSA%%lst%% Foxtel ]^[ Optus were ]v[ were likely to be in competition with each other in relation to the acquisition of programming from programming suppliers%%lst%% including the Hollywood studios (par 339)%%per%%]$~

~$[A substantial purpose of the Foxtel%%dsh%%Optus CSA Provisions was to restrict ]v[ limit the acquisition by Optus ]^[ Foxtel of programming from programming suppliers (par 341)%%per%% 
2827 By reason of the matters pleaded in pars 338%%dsh%%341%%lst%% the Foxtel%%dsh%%Optus CSA contains an exclusionary provision within the meaning of s 4D of the TP Act (par 342)%%per%% 
2828 Seven suffered loss ]^[ damage by reason of the alleged contraventions (par 344)%%per%%]$~ 
~$[But ]f[ the Foxtel%%dsh%%Optus CSA%%lst%% Optus would have entered into a supply agreement with C7 to replace the C7%%dsh%%Optus CSA (par 344(a)) ]^[ as a consequence of the Foxtel%%dsh%%Optus CSA C7 has ceased to operate (par 344(b))%%per%% 
18%%per%%4 Seven%%sqt%%s Submissions 
18%%per%%4%%per%%1 Section 45(2) Effects Case 
2829 Seven submits that Optus acted as a competitive constraint on Foxtel prior to the execution of the Foxtel%%dsh%%Optus CSA%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Seven argues that this can be seen%%lst%% ]f[ example%%lst%% from the fact that Foxtel ]^[ Telstra expressed concerns in mid%%dsh%%2001 about the success of Optus%%sqt%% marketing campaign%%lst%% which had produced an increase in the number of Optus%%sqt%% subscribers%%per%% 
2831 As to the first effect%%lst%% Seven says that the very few channels ]n[ shown on both Foxtel ]^[ Optus are of %%sqt%% marginal appeal %%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Moreover%%lst%% the Foxtel%%dsh%%Optus CSA Provisions reduce%%lst%% %%cmp_if%% ]n[ eliminate%%lst%% any incentive ]f[ Optus to acquire content independently of Foxtel%%per%%]$~ 
~$[If%%lst%% ]f[ example%%lst%% Optus acquired a new sports ]v[ movie channel%%lst%% it would be obliged to offer it (or cause it to be offered) to Foxtel%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Further%%lst%% %%cmp_if%% Foxtel decided ]n[ to carry the channel%%lst%% Optus could only broadcast the content on a higher tier %%cmp_ta%% the equivalent content on Foxtel%%per%% 
2832 As to the pricing%%lst%% Seven submits that the effect of the Foxtel%%dsh%%Optus CSA Provisions was that price competition between Foxtel ]^[ Optus was reduced significantly%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Seven argues that%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%It is unsurprising that Foxtel%%sqt%%s ]^[ Optus%%sqt%% pay TV prices should have been ]s[ similar since the [Foxtel%%dsh%%Optus] CSA%%per%%]$~ 
~$[By reason of the lack of product differentiation identified above %%per%%%%per%%%%per%%]$~ ~$[Foxtel ]^[ Optus were providing very similar products%%per%%]$~ 
~$[That must naturally give rise to price%%dsh%%signalling between them ]^[ ultimately price%%dsh%%matching%%per%%]$~ 
~$[There is little reason ]f[ Foxtel ]^[ Optus to charge significantly different prices ]f[ such almost identical pay TV services%%sqt%%%%per%% 
2833 Seven submits that%%lst%% by reason of the absence of product differentiation ]^[ price competition%%lst%% the Foxtel%%dsh%%Optus CSA had the effect of substantially lessening competition in the retail pay television market%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It relies on the evidence of Mr Williams (Foxtel%%sqt%%s CEO) to support this contention ([1756])%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It also relies on the opinions expressed by Professor Noll ]^[ Dr Smith%%lst%% to the effect that subsequent to the Foxtel%%dsh%%Optus CSA there were simply no mechanisms that allowed competition on either price ]v[ quality between the two retail pay television platforms%%per%% 
2834 Seven accepts that%%lst%% had the Foxtel%%dsh%%Optus CSA ]n[ been executed%%lst%% Optus probably would have implemented the Manage ]f[ Cash strategy%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Despite this%%lst%% Seven argues that Optus would have continued to act as a competitive constraint on Foxtel%%lst%% might have merged (or entered a joint venture) with Austar ]^[ would have been unlikely to close its retail pay television business%%per%% 
2835 Seven%%sqt%%s submissions on this issue depend%%lst%% in part%%lst%% on its contention that the evidence of Mr Lee ]^[ Mr Anderson should ]n[ be accepted in certain respects%%per%%]$~ 
~$[I have explained %%cmp_e%%where ([458]%%dsh%%[459]%%lst%% [460]%%dsh%%[464]) my reasons ]f[ accepting their evidence as their honest assessment of what would have occurred had Foxtel ]^[ Optus ]n[ entered a content supply agreement in March 2002%%per%% 
2836 Seven contends%%lst%% however%%lst%% that even %%cmp_if%% I accept the evidence of Messrs Lee ]^[ Anderson as an honest evaluation of Optus%%sqt%% options both at the time ]^[ in retrospect%%lst%% I should ]n[ accept their assessment as accurate%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Seven identifies a number of matters that it says point to a different conclusion%%per%% 
18%%per%%4%%per%%2 Section 45(2) Purpose Case 
2837 Seven submits that a substantial purpose of the Foxtel%%dsh%%Optus CSA was to remove product differentiation%%per%% 
18%%per%%4%%per%%3 Section 4D Case 
2838 Seven submits that Foxtel ]^[ Optus were in competition with each other at the time they entered into the Foxtel%%dsh%%Optus CSA%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It says that a purpose of the CSA Provisions was to limit the acquisition by the Foxtel Partnership ]^[ Optus of programming from suppliers%%per%% 
2839 Seven recognises that %%sqt%% programming suppliers %%sqt%% might be considered to be a broad class of persons%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Nonetheless%%lst%% it contends that programming suppliers can constitute %%sqt%% particular persons ]v[ classes of persons %%sqt%% ]f[ the purposes of s 4D(1)(b) of the TP Act %%per%%]$~ 
~$[It follows%%lst%% according to Seven%%lst%% that the Foxtel%%dsh%%Optus CSA Provisions are %%sqt%% exclusionary provisions %%sqt%% under the meaning of s 4D%%per%% 
18%%per%%5 Reasoning%%cln%% s 45(2) Effects Case 
2840 In order to determine the effect of the Foxtel%%dsh%%Optus CSA Provisions on competition in the retail pay television market%%lst%% it is necessary to consider what would have happened had the Foxtel%%dsh%%Optus CSA ]n[ been entered into by the parties%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The difficulty confronting Seven is that it accepts that in that situation Optus would have adopted the Manage ]f[ Cash strategy%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The evidence of Mr Lee ]^[ Mr Anderson was to the effect that the Manage ]f[ Cash strategy was very likely to lead to the closure of CMM within a few years (Mr Anderson thought closure was inevitable)%%per%%]$~ 
~$[I have accepted that both witnesses were giving a truthful account of their assessment of CMM%%sqt%%s position ]^[ prospects%%lst%% both in early 2002 ]^[ in retrospect%%per%% 
18%%per%%5%%per%%1 Objective Circumstances 
2841 The truthfulness of the evidence of Mr Lee ]^[ Mr Anderson%%lst%% of course%%lst%% is ]n[ a complete answer to Seven%%sqt%%s submissions%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The objective circumstances relating to CMM could be such that the honestly held assessments of Messrs Lee ]^[ Anderson should ]n[ determine whether in truth there was a real chance%%lst%% in March 2002%%lst%% that CMM%%lst%% including its retail pay television operations%%lst%% could have survived as a business beyond the short winding%%dsh%%down period envisaged by Messrs Lee ]^[ Anderson%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In assessing Seven%%sqt%%s contentions on this issue a number of factors must be kept in mind%%per%% 
2842 First %%lst%% as I discuss in Chapter 20%%lst%% on any view CMM in 2001 ]^[ 2002 was a business that had (in Mr Anderson%%sqt%%s words in evidence) %%sqt%% serious%%lst%% serious problems %%sqt%%%%lst%% of which the greatest was its retail pay television service%%per%%]$~ 
~$[I have referred to CMM%%sqt%%s substantial negative EBITDA over the period 1999 to 2001 ([1512])%%per%% 
2843 It is also necessary to take into account that under the accounting standards adopted by SingTel (Singapore GAAP [Generally Accepted Accounting Principles])%%lst%% CMM recorded an %%sqt%% operational EBITDA %%sqt%% of %%dsh%%$175 million ]f[ the year ended 31 March 2001 ]^[ %%dsh%%$145 million ]f[ the year ended 31 March 2002%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Lee said that Singapore ]^[ Australian accounting practices differed%%lst%% in that the Singapore GAAP required Optus %%sqt%% to expense customer acquisition costs at the time [they were] incurred %%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Lee%%sqt%%s uncontradicted evidence was that the Singapore GAAP more closely reflected the cash nature of the business ]^[ was more consistent with International Financial Reporting Standards %%cmp_ta%% the Australian GAAP%%per%% 
2844 The EBITDA ]f[ CMM contrasted starkly with the performance of Optus%%sqt%% Mobile Division (EBITDA of $799 million in 2001/2002) ]^[ the Optus Business Division (EBITDA of $262 million in 2001/2002)%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In the 2001/2002 financial year%%lst%% the EBITDA margins were 14 per cent ]f[ CMM%%lst%% 17 per cent ]f[ Optus Business ]^[ 33 per cent ]f[ Optus Mobile%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The contrast between the divisions puts in stark perspective Seven%%sqt%%s contention that CMM%%sqt%%s performance had improved in 2001 ]^[ early 2002%%per%% 
2845 Secondly %%lst%% CMM%%sqt%%s troubles had been subject to detailed analysis both by McKinsey ]^[ by Optus itself in the period leading up to the Foxtel%%dsh%%Optus CSA%%per%%]$~ 
~$[McKinsey%%sqt%%s discussion paper of 22 August 2001%%lst%% prepared well into the period of %%sqt%% improved %%sqt%% performance identified by Seven%%lst%% concluded that CMM faced fundamental problems ]^[ had both a weak strategic position ]^[ an unsustainable cost structure%%per%%]$~ 
~$[By February 2002%%lst%% McKinsey thought that only two options ]f[ CMM warranted serious consideration%%cln%% Project Alchemy (which would reduce Optus essentially to a reseller of pay television content) ]^[ Manage ]f[ Cash%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The latter envisaged a drastic curtailment of CMM%%sqt%%s operations ]b[ with the prospect%%lst%% according to McKinsey%%lst%% of achieving %%sqt%% roughly break%%dsh%%even steady state free cash flows in the next 3%%dsh%%4 years %%sqt%% %%cmp_if%% certain financial objectives%%lst%% including aggressive pricing improvements%%lst%% could be achieved%%per%% 
2846 Thirdly %%lst%% Optus%%sqt%% management ]^[ McKinsey had different views about CMM%%sqt%%s prospects under the Manage ]f[ Cash strategy%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Optus%%sqt%% management took a %%sqt%% slightly more pessimistic %%sqt%% approach (to use Mr Lee%%sqt%%s words)%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The management paper prepared ]f[ Optus%%sqt%% board meeting of 21 February 2002 was plainly sceptical about McKinsey%%sqt%%s assessment that Manage ]f[ Cash could produce a roughly break%%dsh%%even outcome inside three to four years%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Management%%sqt%%s view was that in the absence of changes to content pricing (which the paper did ]n[ suggest would occur)%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%this model will likely see CMM trading on in a negative cash flow situation ]f[ the foreseeable future%%sqt%%%%per%% 
2847 Seven repeatedly relies on McKinsey%%sqt%%s assessment in order to support its contention that CMM might have survived the drastic surgery of Manage ]f[ Cash%%per%%]$~ 
~$[McKinsey%%sqt%%s assessment was more optimistic %%cmp_ta%% that of Optus%%sqt%% management%%lst%% ]b[ even McKinsey by no means confidently asserted that the improvements in performance would be achieved%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In any event%%lst%% it is hardly surprising that Optus%%sqt%% management took a less rosy view of CMM%%sqt%%s prospects %%cmp_ta%% did McKinsey%%per%%]$~ 
~$[After all%%lst%% it was management that bore responsibility ]f[ making the critical decisions affecting CMM%%sqt%%s future%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The contemporaneous documentation recording management%%sqt%%s concern as to CMM%%sqt%%s viability is consistent with the evidence of Messrs Lee ]^[ Anderson as to the most likely outcome had Optus chosen to implement the Manage ]f[ Cash strategy%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Not only did the management paper ]f[ the critical board meeting of 21 February 2002 express scepticism about the viability of CMM under Manage ]f[ Cash%%lst%% ]b[ the board minutes reflected the same scepticism%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In particular%%lst%% the minutes recorded that Manage ]f[ Cash would reduce the cash burn to $150 million per annum (hardly a profit) ]^[ that%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%there was no certainty that the industry would have rationalised at economically viable prices down the road%%sqt%%%%per%% 
2848 Fourthly %%lst%% it is critical to understand what the Manage ]f[ Cash strategy would have entailed%%per%%]$~ 
~$[No attempt would be made to attract Foxtel subscribers ]v[ non%%dsh%%pay television subscribers to Optus%%per%%]$~ 
~$[This measure involved making about 200 marketing ]^[ sales employees redundant%%per%% 
2849 It follows that one important consequence of Optus adopting the Manage ]f[ Cash strategy would have been the imposition of severe restrictions on its expenditure on programming content%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Both Mr Lee ]^[ Mr Anderson said that it would have been inconsistent with the Manage ]f[ Cash strategy ]f[ Optus to make significant commitments to the purchase of new programming%%lst%% particularly since the strategy assumed that subscriber numbers would diminish rapidly%%per%% 
2850 A second inevitable consequence of Manage ]f[ Cash would have been high rates of churn among subscribers%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Even with a relatively vigorous marketing program%%lst%% rates of churn ]f[ Optus subscribers were high%%per%%]$~ 
~$[An internal Optus analysis of 1 March 2000%%lst%% ]f[ example%%lst%% showed %%sqt%% [a]nnualised churn %%sqt%% of 47 per cent ]f[ non%%dsh%%bundled customers%%lst%% although it indicated that this rate could be reduced by up to 75 per cent ]f[ subscribers taking at least three products%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Anderson%%sqt%%s view was that Manage ]f[ Cash would produce rates of churn of about 35 per cent per annum%%per%%]$~ 
~$[I see no good reason to doubt the reliability of his estimate%%per%% 
18%%per%%5%%per%%2 CMM Would Have Closed Down 
2851 In view of the four factors I have identified%%lst%% it seems to me that %%cmp_if%% Optus had adopted the Manage ]f[ Cash strategy (as Seven accepts was likely in the absence of the Foxtel%%dsh%%Optus CSA)%%lst%% the strong likelihood is that CMM would have closed down within three to four years of the Foxtel%%dsh%%Optus CSA coming into force in November 2002%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Even %%cmp_if%% some of CMM%%sqt%%s operations had survived%%lst%% the very strong likelihood is that Optus%%sqt%% pay television operations would ]n[ have continued beyond that period%%per%%]$~ 
~$[During the winding down period%%lst%% Optus would have played an ever%%dsh%%diminishing role in the retail pay television market%%lst%% as its subscriber base declined ]^[ as it worked off its MSGs%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In particular%%lst%% Optus would have had little ]v[ no impact in the markets (however defined) ]f[ the acquisition of subscription driving content%%lst%% including sports programming ]^[ movies%%per%% 
18%%per%%5%%per%%3 Answers to Seven%%sqt%%s Contentions 
2852 What I have said answers many of the arguments advanced by Seven%%per%%]$~ 
~$[However%%lst%% I add some further comments to address specific points made by Seven%%per%% 
2853 As I have already explained%%lst%% the financial performance of CMM in 2001 had ]n[ improved to the extent that Seven suggests%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Moreover%%lst%% the increase in Optus%%sqt%% subscriber numbers (from about 200,000 to a peak of about 266,000) must also be placed in context%%per%%]$~ 
~$[As Mr Ebeid of Optus pointed out in his statement%%lst%% the increase was partly attributable to an unsustainable short%%dsh%%term policy of ]n[ charging subscribers telephone line rentals%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In addition%%lst%% during this period Optus took advantage of the fact that it was the only supplier that could bundle pay television ]^[ telephony services%%per%%]$~ 
~$[That advantage%%lst%% too%%lst%% was bound to be short%%dsh%%lived%%lst%% since Telstra was soon to acquire the ability to bundle Foxtel with its own telephony services%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Indeed%%lst%% the Foxtel%%dsh%%Telstra Resale Term Sheet%%lst%% which enabled Telstra to bundle the Foxtel Service with Telstra telephony services%%lst%% was executed on 20 February 2002%%lst%% two weeks before the Foxtel%%dsh%%Optus CSA itself was executed%%per%%]$~ 
~$[As Optus points out%%lst%% the quid pro quo ]f[ the Foxtel%%dsh%%Telstra Resale Term Sheet was the Foxtel%%dsh%%Optus Term Sheet executed on the same day%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Thereafter both Optus ]^[ Telstra could offer bundled services with similar pay television content%%per%% 
2854 I do ]n[ accept Seven%%sqt%%s submission that closing down the whole of CMM would simply have been too difficult a decision ]f[ Optus to make%%per%%]$~ 
~$[There may be times in any business when apparently drastic decisions have to be made %%cmp_b%% of economic imperatives%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Seven says that this litigation is the outcome of just such a decision%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Lee was clear as to what would have happened%%per%%]$~ 
~$[I have reproduced above ([1720]) the portion of Mr Lee%%sqt%%s statement in which he outlined what would have happened under the Manage ]f[ Cash strategy%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Lee acknowledged that shutting down a division is a last resort ]f[ most businesses%%lst%% ]b[ continued%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%Even at this time [September 2001] we were hopeful that we could get an outcome other %%cmp_ta%% shutdown%%per%%]$~ 
~$[But %%cmp_if%% shutdown were the only possibility other %%cmp_ta%% trading on as is%%lst%% %%cmp_t%% I think we would be forced into that circumstance%%per%%]$~

18%%per%%5%%per%%5 Effect of the Foxtel%%dsh%%Optus CSA on Competition 
2860 I do ]n[ understand Seven to submit that the findings which I have made are consistent with concluding that the Foxtel%%dsh%%Optus CSA had the effect ]v[ likely effect of substantially lessening competition in the retail pay television market%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In any event%%lst%% it seems to me clear that pending Optus%%sqt%% departure from the pay television business over a three to four year period%%lst%% it would ]n[ have provided any significant constraint on Foxtel in the retail pay television market%%per%%]$~ 
~$[If that is so%%lst%% the Foxtel%%dsh%%Optus CSA did ]n[ have the effect ]v[ likely effect of substantially lessening competition in a market%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Nonetheless%%lst%% I should refer to the expert evidence%%per%% 
2861 Professor Noll ]^[ Dr Smith were asked to assume that in the absence of the Foxtel%%dsh%%Optus CSA%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%Foxtel%%lst%% Optus ]^[ Austar would have continued to offer pay television services in substantially the same manner that they did in February 2002%%per%%]$~

~$[Neither of the assumptions upon which they were asked to express their opinions has been established by the evidence%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Accordingly%%lst%% the opinions expressed in their reports are of no assistance on the question of whether the Foxtel%%dsh%%Optus CSA had the effect ]v[ likely effect of substantially lessening competition%%per%% 
2863 Professor Hay expressed his opinion in his report%%lst%% in a summary way%%lst%% as follows%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%If %%per%%%%per%%%%per%% one were to assume that%%lst%% without the [Foxtel%%dsh%%Optus] CSA%%lst%% Optus would ]n[ have been a significant competitive factor in the market ]f[ pay TV services on its own%%lst%% nor would it have merged with Austar to compete with Foxtel%%lst%% %%cmp_t%% the [Foxtel%%dsh%%Optus] CSA%%lst%% with the undertakings required by the ACCC%%lst%% would ]n[ have substantially lessened competition in any relevant market%%sqt%%%%per%% 
2864 Professor Hay explained his opinion in his cross%%dsh%%examination%%per%%]$~ 
~$[He was asked whether%%lst%% before he could conclude that the Foxtel%%dsh%%Optus CSA had ]n[ substantially lessened competition%%lst%% he would ]n[ need to exclude possibilities such as take%%dsh%%over by ]v[ merger with a more solvent firm%%lst%% ]v[ reorganisation of the firm in an insolvency administration%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Professor Hay%%sqt%%s response was as follows%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%I%%sqt%%m ]n[ sure that you would%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It seems to me%%lst%% under the assumptions I was asked to make%%lst%% comparing the alternative world%%lst%% the world without the CSA%%lst%% you have got to ask%%cln%% given the reasons Optus was doing badly%%lst%% which I think I have described as partly a sense in which %%dsh%%%%dsh%%%%dsh%% I don%%sqt%%t want to overstate it %%dsh%%%%dsh%%%%dsh%% there may ]n[ be room ]f[ two cable%%dsh%%based pay TV suppliers in a country the size of Australia%%per%%

~$[If that is the reason Optus is failing%%lst%% ]v[ at least one of the reasons%%lst%% that basically their share of the market has shrunk to where basically their costs per subscriber simply don%%sqt%%t permit them to make a profit%%lst%% having them taken over by somebody %%cmp_e%% isn%%sqt%%t going to change that%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Or%%lst%% put differently%%lst%% had they survived in some form%%lst%% I do ]n[ see them as making any significant %%dsh%%%%dsh%%%%dsh%% having any significant effect on whatever ability Foxtel may have to increase prices%%per%%]$~

~$[So under any of a variety of permutations%%lst%% %%cmp_if%% I thought that was going to be the end result%%lst%% that Optus would ]n[ be a boat rocker%%lst%% %%cmp_t%% it seems to me it is safe ]f[ me to conclude that the CSA did ]n[ have any significant adverse effect on competition%%per%% 
%%per%%%%per%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[HIS HONOUR%%cln%% Is your observation that Optus could ]n[ offer genuine price competition given its circumstances dependent upon it being a failing firm? 
%%dsh%%%%dsh%%%%dsh%% Not necessarily failing in the legal sense%%per%%]$~ 
~$[They were doing ]s[ badly that I think their best strategy under the circumstances was basically to simply match the pricing of Foxtel%%lst%% ]n[ be really aggressive in competing%%per%%]$~ 
~$[That%%sqt%%s the way they would maximise their income until the time that they decided simply it was worth going out of the business%%per%%]$~ 
~$[You are assuming%%lst%% in the absence of the CSA%%lst%% that was their preferable strategy%%lst%% you say%%lst%% from an economic perspective%%lst%% absent the CSA? 
%%dsh%%%%dsh%%%%dsh%% I think the assumptions I was asked to make was that they would what I think is called manage ]f[ cash%%lst%% which I take to mean get as much money out of the business [as] you can while you can ]^[ %%cmp_t%% exit%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The firm adopting that strategy as a general matter will basically ]n[ be aggressive on price in a quality competition%%per%%]$~ 
~$[They will take [the] prices of their dominant competitor ]^[ basically price up to that level%%sqt%%%%per%% 
2865 Professor Hay%%sqt%%s responses were made at a relatively general level%%per%%]$~ 
~$[However%%lst%% the findings I have made%%lst%% in my view%%lst%% establish that his opinion correctly analyses the circumstances of the present case%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Given the Manage ]f[ Cash strategy%%lst%% Optus would ]n[ have %%sqt%% rock[ed] the boat %%sqt%% on price%%lst%% quality ]v[ any other aspect of its service%%per%%]$~ 
~$[On the contrary%%lst%% the strategy called ]f[ Optus ]n[ to engage in price competition%%lst%% seek better quality programming ]v[ attempt to attract new subscribers%%per%% 
2866 It follows%%lst%% in my opinion%%lst%% that neither the making of the Foxtel%%dsh%%Optus CSA%%lst%% nor giving effect to the Foxtel%%dsh%%Optus CSA Provisions%%lst%% had the effect ]v[ likely effect of substantially lessening competition in the retail pay television market%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In the absence of the Foxtel%%dsh%%Optus CSA%%lst%% it is very likely that Optus would have closed down its pay television operations within three to four years%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Pending the close%%dsh%%down of its pay television operations%%lst%% Optus would ]n[ have provided any significant constraint on Foxtel on the price ]v[ quality of the services provided to retail pay television subscribers%%per%% 
18%%per%%6 Reasoning%%cln%% s 45(2) Purpose Case 
2867 There is a difficulty in the way Seven presents its purpose case%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The Statement of Claim pleads that removal of product differentiation between Foxtel ]^[ Optus was a substantial purpose of the Foxtel%%dsh%%Optus CSA Provisions ]^[ that this involved a substantial lessening of competition in the retail pay television market%%per%%]$~ 
~$[However%%lst%% par 322 of the Statement of Claim identifies two purposes (lowering the cost of programming ]^[ conferring greater bargaining power on Foxtel ]^[ Optus in negotiating with programming suppliers) that have nothing to do with competition in the retail pay television market%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The two purposes identified in par 322 are concerned with competition in a market (however defined) ]f[ the acquisition of programming%%lst%% rather %%cmp_ta%% in the retail pay television market%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The former is ]n[ a market on which Seven relies ]f[ its purpose case in relation to the Foxtel%%dsh%%Optus CSA%%per%% 
(Paragraph 325 of the Statement of Claim also refers to the retail television market%%lst%% ]b[ this is ]n[ pressed%%per%% 
) 
2868 Given this pleading%%lst%% it is perhaps ]n[ surprising that four out of the five evidentiary matters relied on by Seven in its Closing Submissions have nothing to do with the state of competition in the retail pay television market%%per%%]$~ 
~$[They are relevant only to a lessening of competition in an unpleaded market ]f[ the acquisition of certain kinds of programming%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The fifth matter relied on by Seven%%lst%% Mr McLachlan%%sqt%%s memorandum of 25 October 2001%%lst%% recorded arguments which Mr McLachlan apparently intended to use in a meeting to persuade Telstra to support content sharing%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr McLachlan%%sqt%%s arguments were founded on the proposition that content sharing would actually enhance competition between Telstra ]v[ Optus ]f[ bundled pay television ]^[ telephony services (a business from which Telstra had hitherto been excluded)%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The memorandum does ]n[ suggest that PBL%%sqt%%s objective was to remove product differentiation between Foxtel ]^[ Optus ]^[ thus reduce competition in the retail pay television market%%per%% 
2869 As has often happened in this case%%lst%% Seven%%sqt%%s Reply Submissions take a different tack from its Closing Submissions%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The Reply Submissions argue that the purpose of the Foxtel%%dsh%%Optus CSA Provisions was to allow both the Foxtel ]^[ Optus platforms access to a greater amount of each other%%sqt%%s programming content%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The Reply Submissions make no reference to the evidence relied on by Seven in the Closing Submissions%%lst%% ]^[ only passing reference to the impact of the Foxtel%%dsh%%Optus CSA on the ability of Foxtel ]v[ Optus to acquire content more cheaply%%per%% 
2870 Seven%%sqt%%s Reply Submissions argue that the purpose of a provision may be inferred from its effect%%per%%]$~ 
~$[For reasons I have explained%%lst%% the effects of the CSA Provisions did ]n[ include a substantial lessening of competition in the retail pay television market%%per%%]$~ 
~$[But ]f[ the Foxtel%%dsh%%Optus CSA%%lst%% Optus would have remained in the pay television business ]f[ only three to four years and%%lst%% in the period leading up to the closure of its business%%lst%% would ]n[ have sought%%lst%% to compete actively ]f[ subscribers%%lst%% whether by way of price%%lst%% content ]v[ otherwise%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Without the Foxtel%%dsh%%Optus CSA%%lst%% after a period of three to four years Foxtel would have been the only pay television operator to offer content in the geographic areas in which both Foxtel ]^[ Optus operated at the time the parties entered into the Foxtel%%dsh%%Optus CSA%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In these circumstances%%lst%% the obvious inference is that none of the parties to the Optus%%dsh%%Foxtel CSA had the purpose of substantially lessening competition in the retail pay television market%%per%% 
2871 In assessing the purpose of the parties to the Foxtel%%dsh%%Optus CSA%%lst%% other factors must also be borne in mind%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It is difficult%%lst%% ]f[ example%%lst%% to see how Optus%%sqt%% acquisition of AFL content can be attributed to the Foxtel%%dsh%%Optus CSA%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Optus acquired the right to AFL content via the Foxtel%%dsh%%Optus Fox Footy Agreement of 19 February 2002%%lst%% before the Foxtel%%dsh%%Optus CSA was executed%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In any event%%lst%% under the terms of the AFL%%dsh%%News Licence%%lst%% News was obliged to offer AFL content to Optus on reasonable terms%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Dr Smith agreed in her evidence that%%lst%% in circumstances where Optus had access to AFL content until the end of the 2001 season%%lst%% the acquisition by Optus of AFL content in 2002 was pro%%dsh%%competitive%%lst%% %%cmp_b%% it increased Optus%%sqt%% chances of staying in the pay television business%%per%% 
2872 Similarly%%lst%% Optus acquired the Fox Sports channels via the Foxtel%%dsh%%Optus Term Sheet of 20 February 2002%%lst%% which also pre%%dsh%%dated the Foxtel%%dsh%%Optus CSA%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The Foxtel%%dsh%%Optus Term Sheet was closely linked to the agreement between the Foxtel partners permitting Telstra to bundle its telephony services with the Foxtel Service%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Had the Foxtel%%dsh%%Optus CSA ]n[ been entered into%%lst%% Optus would still have acquired the Fox Sports channels as the quid pro quo ]f[ Telstra being able to offer bundled services%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In addition%%lst%% Dr Smith agreed that Telstra%%sqt%%s newly acquired ability to bundle pay television ]^[ telephony services would have given consumers a choice of bundled services%%lst%% whereas previously only Optus offered the bundled product%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%And that additional competition%%lst%% you would expect from an economic perspective%%lst%% to put pressure on each of those parties to offer more attractive ]^[ more price competitive bundles on an overall basis? 
%%dsh%%%%dsh%%%%dsh%% I would think it was part of the competitive process%%lst%% yes%%sqt%%%%per%% 
2873 So far as movie channels are concerned%%lst%% Optus had relinquished its entitlement to exclusivity with Disney in 1999 as part of negotiations relating to its MSG obligations%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It had also relinquished its entitlement to exclusivity with The Movie Network Channels Pty Ltd in 2000%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Foxtel commenced broadcasting the Disney Channel in December 1999%%lst%% ]b[ had ]n[ taken up the Movie Network channels at the time the Foxtel%%dsh%%Optus CSA was executed%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Thus in March 2002%%lst%% Foxtel already had the Disney Channel ]^[ there was no impediment to it acquiring the Movie Network channels on a non%%dsh%%exclusive basis%%per%% 
2874 Moreover%%lst%% as both Dr Smith ]^[ Professor Noll acknowledged in their evidence%%lst%% product differentiation is ]n[ necessarily competition%%dsh%%enhancing ]^[ lack of product differentiation may indeed increase competition in a market%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The cross%%dsh%%examination of Professor Noll included the following passage%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%MR ARCHIBALD%%cln%% I want to ask you about differentiation between products in a market%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Where there is differentiation between products in a market%%lst%% Professor%%lst%% the competition between those products is less intense %%cmp_ta%% %%cmp_if%% there were lesser differentiation%%scn%% is that correct? 
%%dsh%%%%dsh%%%%dsh%% Well%%lst%% it may ]v[ may ]n[ be%%lst%% depending on what the effects of the differentiation are%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Yes%%lst%% I understand the difficulty with the generalisation%%per%%]$~ 
~$[But is it right as a general proposition that the greater the differences between products in the market the less strongly substitutable they are one ]f[ the other? 
%%dsh%%%%dsh%%%%dsh%% Usually ]b[ ]n[ always%%per%%

~$[And is the converse true%%cln%% usually the lesser the differentiation between products%%lst%% the stronger the substitutability between them?

~$[And stronger substitution bespeaks more intense competition%%lst%% doesn%%sqt%%t it? 
%%dsh%%%%dsh%%%%dsh%% The definition of competition is a circumstance in which two products are close substitutes%%sqt%%%%per%% 
2875 Seven%%sqt%%s Closing Submissions appear to assume that an agreement between retail pay television platforms to acquire similar content on an non%%dsh%%exclusive basis%%lst%% ]s[ that the content offered by one is ]n[ materially different from the content offered by the other%%lst%% necessarily involves a purpose of substantially lessening competition in the retail pay television market%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Seven%%sqt%%s Reply Submissions seem to argue that it is ]n[ merely a question of a reduction in product differentiation%%lst%% ]b[ how the reduction is achieved%%per%%]$~ 
~$[According to Seven%%lst%% the Foxtel%%dsh%%Optus CSA Provisions removed Foxtel%%sqt%%s ability to differentiate its content ]^[ Optus%%sqt%% incentive to differentiate its content%%per%%]$~ 
~$[This is said to be %%sqt%% plainly anti%%dsh%%competitive %%sqt%%%%per%% 
2876 It is ]n[ clear to me why%%lst%% even %%cmp_if%% some ]v[ all of the parties to the Foxtel%%dsh%%Optus CSA sought to achieve a reduction in product differentiation%%lst%% this of itself would necessarily establish the purpose of substantially lessening competition in the retail pay television market%%per%%]$~ 
~$[A reduction of product differentiation%%lst%% particularly in subscription driving content%%lst%% might materially improve the offerings available to subscribers to each platform and%%lst%% depending upon the circumstances%%lst%% increase the prospect of price competition%%per%%]$~ 
~$[If%%lst%% ]f[ example%%lst%% both retail platforms offer AFL ]^[ NRL content%%lst%% they could appeal to the same groups of sporting enthusiasts%%lst%% instead of to two largely discrete groups%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Whether greater price competition would occur might depend upon how the content is offered to subscribers ]^[ what scope there would be ]f[ each platform to undercut the other%%per%% 
(Seven does ]n[ rely in its purpose case on any objective of reducing price competition between Foxtel ]^[ Optus%%per%% 
) 
2877 In assessing the significance of a reduction in product differentiation%%lst%% it is also relevant to take into account developments within the retail pay television industry%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The retail pay television market in Australia has ]n[ been one in which the participants have sought to differentiate their content%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In particular%%lst%% Optus had ]n[ sought to differentiate its content from Foxtel%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It had abandoned exclusivity in movie programming%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Optus%%lst%% like Foxtel%%lst%% had NRL content%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It had sought unsuccessfully to acquire the Fox Sports channels%%per%%]$~ 
~$[While only Optus (and Austar) had AFL content prior to 2002 (through C7)%%lst%% that was ]n[ the consequence of any strategy Optus itself had adopted%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Rather it was the product of Foxtel%%sqt%%s desire to acquire the AFL pay television rights directly from the AFL%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Even putting to one side the content agreements entered into in late February 2002%%lst%% the Foxtel%%dsh%%Optus CSA merely formalised a position that was very likely to come about in any event %%cmp_if%% Optus was to continue offering pay television services beyond the short term%%per%% 
2878 With this background in mind%%lst%% the evidence in my opinion does ]n[ support Seven%%sqt%%s contention that the parties to the Foxtel%%dsh%%Optus CSA had a substantial objective of reducing the extent of content differentiation between Foxtel ]^[ Optus%%per%%]$~

~$[The fact that Seven%%sqt%%s submissions on s 4D are brief is ]n[ a cause ]f[ criticism%%per%%]$~ 
~$[But in the context of this case%%lst%% the brevity of the submissions suggests that Seven only faintly presses its contention that the parties to the Foxtel%%dsh%%Optus CSA contravened s 45(2) of the TP Act by entering into an agreement containing an %%sqt%% exclusionary provision %%sqt%% ]^[ by giving effect to the Foxtel%%dsh%%Optus CSA Provisions%%per%% 
18%%per%%7%%per%%1 In Competition with Each Other 
2887 Seven%%sqt%%s pleaded case is that at the time of entering into the Foxtel%%dsh%%Optus CSA%%lst%% Foxtel ]^[ Optus were ]v[ were likely to be in competition with each other %%sqt%% in relation to the acquisition of programming from programming suppliers%%lst%% including the Hollywood studios %%sqt%%%%per%%]$~

~$[Neither the Statement of Claim nor Seven%%sqt%%s submissions identify the market in which it says Foxtel ]^[ Optus were competing ]f[ the acquisition of %%sqt%% programming %%sqt%%%%per%% 
2888 The market relied on by Seven is apparently concerned with the supply ]^[ acquisition of any kind of programming%%lst%% ]n[ merely subscription driving content ]v[ indeed programming limited to any particular genre%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It is ]n[ clear whether the market is %%sqt%% in Australia %%sqt%%%%lst%% since the Statement of Claim refers to programming provided by the Hollywood studios%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The significance of this is that s 4E confines the concept of a market ]f[ the purposes of the TP Act %%lst%% in the absence of a contrary intention%%lst%% to a %%sqt%% market in Australia %%sqt%%%%per%%

2895 The joint judgment of Gummow%%lst%% Hayne ]^[ Heydon JJ noted (at 89%%dsh%%90 [87]) that there had been little argument in Rural Press v ACCC as to whether there was a lack of particularity in the class of persons identified by the trial Judge%%lst%% namely %%sqt%% customers ]^[ potential customers of the River News%%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Nonetheless%%lst%% their Honours expressed the view that the class had been adequately defined%%per%%]$~ 
~$[They pointed out that even %%cmp_if%% s 4D required the identity of members of the class to be ascertained%%lst%% it would have been possible to draw up a list of advertisers who had used the River News ]^[ that would have constituted a sufficient class ]f[ the purposes of the section%%per%% 
2896 The joint judgment in Rural Press v ACCC 216 CLR%%lst%% at 90 [88]%%lst%% referred to the judgment of the Full Court of this Court in ASX Operations Pty Ltd v Pont Data Australia Pty Ltd (No 1) (1990) 27 FCR 460%%per%%]$~

~$[The joint judgment in Rural Press v ACCC observed (216 CLR%%lst%% at 90 [88]) that ASX v Pont Data had ]n[ been overruled by the High Court in News v South Sydney %%per%%]$~

2897 Gleeson CJ ]^[ Callinan J%%lst%% in their concurring judgment in Rural Press v ACCC %%lst%% clearly favoured a narrower construction of the statutory concept of a class of persons%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Their Honours reasoned as follows (216 CLR%%lst%% at 61%%dsh%%63 [5]%%dsh%%[12])%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%In applying s 4D%%lst%% courts have had to consider the statutory concept of a provision (of a contract%%lst%% arrangement ]v[ understanding) which has the purpose of preventing%%lst%% restricting ]v[ limiting supply to ]v[ acquisition from particular persons ]v[ classes of persons%%per%%]$~ 
~$[This is a compound concept involving a certain kind of purpose%%lst%% having as its object particular persons ]v[ classes of persons%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The particularity of the persons ]v[ classes of persons who are the objects of the purpose as defined ]^[ proscribed is essential to the concept of an exclusionary provision%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The significance of a finding that a provision is an exclusionary provision within s 4D ]^[ s 45(2)(a)(i) ]^[ (b)(i) is that such a finding engages a per se legislative prohibition%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It becomes unnecessary to consider whether it has the purpose ]v[ effect of substantially lessening competition in a market%%per%%]$~ 
~$[If attention were ]n[ paid to the compound nature of an exclusionary provision%%lst%% ]^[ the requirement of particularity of its object ]v[ objects%%lst%% there is a danger that s 4D would be given an operation that would greatly reduce the statutory significance of lessening competition%%lst%% in relation to agreements between competitors generally%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Contracts%%lst%% arrangements ]v[ understandings between competitors commonly involve some form of prevention%%lst%% restriction ]v[ limitation of supply ]v[ acquisition of goods ]v[ services%%per%%]$~ 
~$[If two hairdressers in a suburban main street were to have an understanding that one would provide services to men%%lst%% ]^[ one would provide services to women%%lst%% it may be unlikely that their understanding would involve a substantial lessening of competition in a market%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It would be surprising %%cmp_if%% it were held%%lst%% nevertheless%%lst%% to contravene the Act%%per%%]$~ 
~$[To the extent to which it had an anti%%dsh%%competitive purpose%%lst%% that purpose would ]n[ be %%dqt%%directed toward%%dqt%% particular persons ]v[ classes of persons%%per%% 
%%per%%%%per%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[We agree with Gummow%%lst%% Hayne ]^[ Heydon JJ that there was sufficient particularity in the present case%%lst%% ]b[ we can think of other cases in which it would be absent%%lst%% notwithstanding the existence of a purpose of preventing%%lst%% restricting%%lst%% ]v[ limiting supply ]v[ acquisition%%per%%]$~ 
~$[If it were ]n[ so%%lst%% the references to particular persons ]v[ classes of persons would be redundant%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The Full Court referred to the changes that have taken place in the form of s 4D%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In its original form%%lst%% the proscribed purpose was of preventing%%lst%% restricting ]v[ limiting supply to ]v[ acquisition from particular persons%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The words %%dqt%%or classes of persons%%dqt%% were added in 1986%%lst%% following some decisions that were thought to reveal an undue narrowness in the legislation it its original form%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Those words were clearly intended to widen the provision%%lst%% ]b[ ]n[ to change its entire character%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The proscribed purpose must still be one that is directed toward particular persons ]v[ classes of persons%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Parliament did ]n[ delete the word %%dqt%%particular%%dqt%% ]^[ substitute the word %%dqt%%any%%dqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Nor did it remove all reference to persons as objects of the proscribed purpose%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The legislative history%%lst%% as well as the text%%lst%% tends strongly against a reading of the section which requires only that a provision of a contract%%lst%% arrangement ]v[ understanding has the purpose of preventing%%lst%% restricting ]v[ limiting%%lst%% in any way%%lst%% supply ]v[ acquisition%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Supply ]v[ acquisition will always be to ]v[ from persons%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Ordinary principles of construction require that the references to particular persons ]v[ classes of persons be given work to do%%scn%% they are ]n[ mere drafting verbosity%%per%%]$~ 
~$[A court construing a provision in an Act %%dqt%%must strive to give meaning to every word of the provision%%dqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[A court will seek to avoid a construction of a statute that renders some of its language otiose%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Here%%lst%% that consideration is powerfully reinforced by the legislative history%%lst%% which shows that the reference to particular persons was originally an essential feature of s 4D%%lst%% ]^[ that the addition of the reference to classes was intended to expand it%%lst%% ]n[ to make it superfluous%%per%% 
%%per%%%%per%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[An exclusionary provision may be directed toward particular persons ]v[ classes of persons without necessarily having a purpose of injuring ]v[ disadvantaging them%%per%%]$~ 
~$[However%%lst%% a purpose of the kind defined ]^[ proscribed must exist%%lst%% ]^[ must be directed toward particular persons ]v[ classes of persons%%lst%% ]f[ the legislative prohibition to apply%%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Their Honours did ]n[ refer to ASX v Pont Data 27 FCR%%lst%% at 488%%lst%% ]b[ it is difficult to reconcile their reasoning with that decision%%per%% 
2898 The facts of the present case differ from Rural Press v ACCC %%lst%% in that the class of persons at whom the CSA Provisions are said to be directed is ]n[ defined by reference to geographical location%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The %%sqt%% class %%sqt%% here is defined by reference to a limitation imposed by the CSA Provisions on the acquisition of programming%%cln%% that is%%lst%% the class consists of all programming suppliers%%lst%% anywhere in the world%%lst%% whose products ]^[ services Foxtel ]^[ Optus are prevented from attempting to acquire in competition with each other%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The application of s 45(2) (read with s 4D)%%lst%% %%cmp_if%% otherwise satisfied%%lst%% %%cmp_tf%% appears to turn on whether the Full Federal Court%%sqt%%s statement of principle in ASX v Pont Data 27 FCR at 488%%lst%% is correct%%per%%

19%%per%%1 Causes of Action 
2901 Seven pursues four causes of action (other %%cmp_ta%% its claims based on anti%%dsh%%competitive conduct) arising out of the process by which the NRL Partnership awarded the NRL pay television rights ]f[ 2001 to 2006 to Fox Sports%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It will be recalled that%%lst%% at a meeting held on 13 December 2000%%lst%% the NRL PEC resolved to accept an offer by Fox Sports ]f[ the NRL pay television rights ]^[ also resolved to enter into a separate names%%lst%% sponsorship ]^[ internet rights agreement with Telstra%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The agreement between the NRL Partnership ]^[ Fox Sports was executed on the evening of 13 December 2000%%lst%% following the conclusion of the PEC meeting%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The agreement between the NRL Partnership ]^[ Telstra was executed on 15 December%%lst%% two days later%%per%% 
2902 The four causes of action are as follows%%cln%% 
(i) The first is an action ]f[ breach of a duty of confidence arising from the disclosure by Mr Philip%%lst%% a member of the NRL PEC%%lst%% of what is said to have been confidential information%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The disclosure concerned the terms of C7%%sqt%%s offer of 5 December 2000%%lst%% to acquire the NRL pay television rights%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Seven claims that Mr Philip disclosed the confidential information relating to the bid to News%%lst%% Foxtel%%lst%% PBL%%lst%% Telstra ]^[ Fox Sports%%lst%% in circumstances which each of them knew breached confidentiality%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Seven also says that these parties misused the confidential information to Seven%%sqt%%s disadvantage%%per%% 
(ii) The second cause of action is based on misleading representations said to have been made by the NRL Partnership in a press release issued on 14 December 2000%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Seven claims that the press release falsely stated that the agreement between Fox Sports ]^[ the NRL Partnership in respect of the NRL pay television rights was worth %%sqt%% almost $400 million %%sqt%% ]^[ that the %%sqt%% guaranteed figure from Fox Sports was higher %%cmp_ta%% that of C7 %%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In consequence the members of the NRL Partnership (ARL ]^[ NRLI) are said to have engaged in misleading ]v[ deceptive conduct in contravention of s 52 of the TP Act%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Seven seeks only declaratory relief in respect of this cause of action ]^[ does ]n[ press its pleaded claim ]f[ damages%%per%% 
(iii) The third is an action against the NRL Partnership or%%lst%% alternatively%%lst%% NRL Ltd%%lst%% based on representations to Seven that C7%%sqt%%s offer ]f[ the NRL pay television rights would be treated in a fair ]^[ impartial manner%%per%%]$~ 
~$[These representations are said to have been misleading ]v[ deceptive in contravention of s 52 of the TP Act %%lst%% in that the NRL Partnership ]v[ the NRL had no reasonable grounds ]f[ making them ]^[ in any event departed from the representations without informing Seven%%per%% 
(iv) The fourth cause of action is a claim against the NRL Partnership ]f[ breach of an agreement with Seven to treat its offer ]f[ the NRL pay television rights in a fair ]^[ impartial manner%%per%% 
19%%per%%2 Legislation 
2903 The provisions of the TP Act bearing on the causes of action addressed in this Chapter are ss 51A%%lst%% 52 ]^[ 82%%per%% 
2904 Section 52 of the TP Act provides that%%cln%%

~$[Section 52 is in Pt V of the TP Act%%per%% 
19%%per%%3 Was C7%%sqt%%s Bid ]f[ the NRL Pay Television Rights Genuine? 
2907 News%%sqt%% first answer is that Seven cannot succeed in establishing any of the four causes of action it has pleaded %%cmp_b%% C7 never engaged in a bona fide attempt to acquire the NRL pay television rights%%per%%]$~ 
~$[News says that Seven engaged in a careful ]^[ deliberate strategy that was designed to ensure that C7 would never be forced to take the NRL pay television rights on the terms it had purported to offer%%per%%]$~ 
~$[According to News%%lst%% the true purpose of C7%%sqt%%s participation in the bidding was to put pressure on News to abandon its bid ]f[ the AFL pay television rights%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In any event%%lst%% Seven was content to force News to pay as much as possible ]f[ the NRL pay television rights%%per%% 
2908 News contends that Seven%%sqt%%s strategy involved making what could be presented as a very high offer%%lst%% ]b[ one which included terms that Seven knew would be unacceptable ]v[ unattractive to the NRL%%per%%]$~ 
~$[This was done initially%%lst%% ]s[ News argues%%lst%% in order to delay the NRL bidding process until after the AFL pay television rights had been awarded%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Later%%lst%% however%%lst%% Seven appreciated that bidding ]f[ the NRL pay television rights was likely to harm its bid ]f[ the AFL pay television rights ]^[ this realisation prompted it to bring the NRL bidding process to %%sqt%% an abrupt end %%sqt%%%%per%% 
2909 Although News puts the genuineness of C7%%sqt%%s bids at the forefront of its submissions%%lst%% it is ]n[ necessary to deal with the issue of genuineness unless Seven otherwise makes out the elements of at least one of the four causes of action upon which it relies%%per%%]$~ 
~$[I think the better approach is to consider first whether%%lst%% on the evidence%%lst%% Seven has made out the elements of the four causes of action which arise out of the bidding process ]f[ the NRL pay television rights ]v[ is otherwise entitled to relief%%lst%% independently of the genuineness ]v[ otherwise of Seven%%sqt%%s bids ]f[ the NRL pay television rights%%per%%]$~

2910 Seven pleads that during the period 16 November 2000 to 13 December 2000 it made a series of four offers to the NRL Partnership to acquire the NRL pay television rights ]f[ the 2001 to 2006 seasons%%per%%]$~

~$[Seven alleges that the terms of each offer%%lst%% including the amounts offered were confidential%%per%%]$~

2911 Seven pleads that by reason of these matters the NRL Partnership owed C7 a duty of confidence in respect of the terms of the C7 offers%%lst%% including the amount C7 was offering ]f[ the NRL pay television rights (par 477)%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Seven alleges that in breach of this duty of confidence the terms of the offer of 5 December 2000%%lst%% including the proposed price%%lst%% were disclosed to Foxtel%%lst%% News%%lst%% PBL%%lst%% Telstra ]^[ Fox Sports %%sqt%% by a representative of the NRL Partnership %%sqt%%%%per%% 
2912 Seven pleads that the information was communicated in circumstances that made it apparent that the information was confidential ]^[ was being disclosed in breach of an obligation of confidence (par 479)%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Seven also alleges that the confidential information was used by Fox Sports to make a rival bid%%scn%% by Foxtel%%lst%% Fox Sports ]^[ Telstra to enter into the NRL Bidding Agreement%%scn%% ]^[ by Mr Philip%%lst%% through his dealings with Mr Akhurst%%lst%% to induce Telstra to support the payment by Foxtel to Fox Sports provided ]f[ in the NRL Bidding Agreement (that is%%lst%% the agreement of 13 December 2000 entitled %%sqt%% Internet ]^[ Sponsorship Rights %%dsh%%%%dsh%%%%dsh%% Fox Sports/Foxtel %%sqt%%) ]^[ to agree to acquire the NRL internet ]^[ naming rights (par 480)%%per%%]$~

2914 It is common ground that Mr Anderson (Seven%%sqt%%s director of Sports ]^[ Olympics) conveyed C7%%sqt%%s offer of 5 December 2000 by fax to Mr Moffett%%lst%% the CEO of NRL%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It will be recalled that the offer provided ]f[ a cash payment of up to $62%%per%%5 million per annum%%lst%% including GST%%lst%% ]f[ the NRL pay television rights%%lst%% depending upon the %%sqt%% total number of homes subscribing to the Pay TV services that carry the NRL Product %%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The offer also provided ]f[ %%sqt%% contra %%sqt%% of $4 million per annum to promote the NRL Competition on the 7 Network ]^[ its affiliates%%per%%

~$[Seven submits%%lst%% however%%lst%% that none of the alleged public disclosures affected the confidential quality of the offer made on 5 December 2000%%per%%

~$[First%%lst%% the previous offers made by C7 were either expressed to be confidential ]v[ were the subject of assurances from the NRL Partnership that they would be treated as confidential%%per%%]$~

~$[It submits%%lst%% among many other arguments%%lst%% that Mr Philip%%sqt%%s conduct in destroying his copies of the handwritten faxes ]^[ in asking Mr Akhurst ]^[ Mr Falloon to do the same (at least in relation to the first fax) suggests that Mr Philip believed that he was unlawfully disclosing confidential information%%per%% 
2920 Seven submits that the recipients of the information concerning C7%%sqt%%s offer of 5 December 2000 knew that the information was confidential%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Seven says that this was true of the recipients of the handwritten faxes ]^[ of the persons attending the %%sqt%% principals %%sqt%% meeting of 13 December 2000%%per%%]$~

~$[The first is where a person is under a contractual obligation%%lst%% express ]v[ implied%%lst%% ]n[ to use ]v[ publish certain information%%per%%]$~

~$[Seven makes no claim founded on contract%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Therefore it is only the equitable principles relating to confidential information that are relevant to this case%%per%% 
2950 The equitable jurisdiction to deal with cases of breach of confidence is said to be ancient%%cln%% see Coco v AN Clark (Engineers) Ltd (1968) 1A IPR 587%%lst%% at 590%%lst%% where Megarry J traced its origins at least to the time of the Statute of Uses 1535 %%per%%]$~ 
~$[The fundamental notion underlying the intervention of equity in relation to confidential information is that the circumstances%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%are such that the conscience of a recipient ]v[ possessor of information is ]s[ affected as to make it %%dqt%%unconscionable%%dqt%% on his part to publish ]v[ use the information%%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Deta Nominees v Viscount Plastic [1979] VR%%lst%% at 191%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The initial question to be addressed is whether the information has been imparted in confidence ]s[ as to bind the conscience of the defendant (or respondent) in a particular way%%cln%% Smith Kline French Laboratories (Australia) Ltd v Secretary%%lst%% Department of Community Services ]^[ Health (1990) 95 ALR 87%%lst%% at 101%%lst%% per Gummow J%%per%% 
2951 In Coco v Clark%%lst%% Megarry J considered (1A IPR%%lst%% at 590) that three elements are normally required %%cmp_if%%%%lst%% independently of contract%%lst%% a case of breach of confidence is to succeed%%cln%%

2952 In Corrs Pavey Whiting Byrne v Collector of Customs (Vic) (1987) 14 FCR 434%%lst%% at 443%%lst%% Gummow J regarded it as settled that a plaintiff ]v[ applicant must satisfy four criteria to make out a case in equity ]f[ the protection of allegedly confidential information%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%The plaintiff%%cln%% (i) must be able to identify with specificity%%lst%% ]^[ ]n[ merely in global terms%%lst%% that which is said to be the information in question%%scn%% ]^[ must also be able to show that (ii) the information has the necessary quality of confidentiality (and is not%%lst%% ]f[ example%%lst%% common ]v[ public knowledge)%%scn%% (iii) the information was received by the defendant in such circumstances as to import an obligation of confidence%%scn%% ]^[ (iv) there is actual ]v[ threatened misuse of that information%%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Although his Honour dissented as to the result%%lst%% the majority did ]n[ disagree with this formulation%%per%%

~$[This is perhaps ]n[ surprising%%lst%% given the infinite range of circumstances in which the principles might be invoked%%per%%]$~ 
~$[As Gleeson CJ observed in ABC v Lenah Game 208 CLR%%lst%% at 227 [45]%%lst%% the difficulty in any given case is to determine what a %%sqt%% properly formed ]^[ instructed conscience %%sqt%% has to say about the particular circumstances%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The circumstances include the nature of the allegedly confidential information ]^[ the manner in which it was communicated to the defendant%%per%% 
2954 There is a factual dispute in this case as to whether Seven %%sqt%% leaked %%sqt%% details of C7%%sqt%%s bids ]f[ the NRL pay television rights to the media in late November ]^[ early December 2000%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Sumption accepted that %%cmp_if%% Seven leaked details of the bid of 5 December 2000%%lst%% its breach of confidentiality claim was bound to fail%%per%%]$~ 
~$[That concession is clearly right%%lst%% since it could hardly be said in those circumstances that the details of the bid were confidential%%per%%]$~ 
~$[As Megarry J observed in Coco v Clark 1A IPR%%lst%% at 590%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%there can be no breach of confidence in revealing to others something which is already common knowledge%%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[A fortiori%%lst%% there can be no breach of confidence when the person complaining has made the information common knowledge%%per%% 
2955 Mr Sumption also accepted that %%cmp_if%% Seven leaked details of the two bids by C7 predating its bid of 5 December 2000%%lst%% ]b[ ]n[ the third bid%%lst%% a reasonable bystander would ]n[ ]s[ readily conclude that the third bid was confidential%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The reference to a %%sqt%% reasonable bystander %%sqt%% may have been to Megarry J%%sqt%%s suggestion in Coco v Clark 1A IPR%%lst%% at 591%%lst%% that the %%sqt%% reasonable man %%sqt%% test can be pressed into service when determining whether information has been communicated in circumstances importing an obligation of confidence%%per%%]$~

19%%per%%4%%per%%8%%per%%1 FINDINGS OF FACT 
2956 The first issue is whether the information identified by Seven as confidential had the necessary quality of confidentiality to attract the intervention of equity%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The information comprises three key elements of C7%%sqt%%s bid ]f[ the NRL pay television rights%%lst%% which was communicated to the NRL PEC through Mr Moffett%%lst%% under cover of C7%%sqt%%s letter of 5 December 2000%%per%%]$~ 
~$[To determine whether this information was confidential it is necessary to make findings about the public release of information concerning C7%%sqt%%s first two bids ]f[ the NRL pay television rights%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It is also necessary to make findings about the circumstances surrounding the communication of C7%%sqt%%s third bid to the NRL PEC%%per%% 
2957 News invites me to find that Seven %%sqt%% orchestrated %%sqt%% leaks to the media of the contents of the first C7 offer of 16 November 2000%%per%%]$~ 
~$[There is evidence which points in this direction%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Masters%%sqt%% article in the Sydney Morning Herald of 20 November 2000 can be read as suggesting that Seven disclosed the terms of C7%%sqt%%s bid to the NRL clubs%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Masters was regarded by Seven%%sqt%%s public affairs representative%%lst%% Mr Francis%%lst%% as being %%sqt%% on our C7 rugby league payroll %%sqt%% ]^[ as Seven%%sqt%%s %%sqt%% old faithful warhorse %%sqt%% %%per%%]$~ 
~$[Moreover%%lst%% Mr Stokes admitted that very shortly after the Seven board meeting of 17 November 2000%%lst%% at which C7%%sqt%%s first bid was approved%%lst%% he telephoned Mr Hill (a director of both ARL ]^[ NRL Ltd) %%sqt%% to tell him we were making an offer %%sqt%%%%per%% 
2958 In his email of 23 November 2000%%lst%% Mr Francis informed Mr Stokes%%lst%% among others%%lst%% that Seven had been careful ]n[ to leave its fingerprints on any story in the press in the previous ten days%%per%%]$~ 
~$[As Mr Stokes accepted%%lst%% Mr Francis is likely to have known of the terms of C7%%sqt%%s first offer ]f[ the NRL pay television rights%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Stokes agreed that he understood at the time that Mr Francis was briefing the press on a basis that was ]n[ attributable to Seven%%per%%]$~ 
~$[While no doubt Mr Francis was briefing the press on AFL%%dsh%%related matters at the time%%lst%% there is no particular reason to interpret his %%sqt%% fingerprints%%sqt%% comment as limited to briefings on those matters%%per%% 
2959 I think that the likelihood is that Mr Francis%%lst%% on behalf of Seven%%lst%% gave information to selected reporters about aspects of C7%%sqt%%s first bid ]f[ the NRL pay television rights%%per%%]$~ 
~$[I am reinforced in that conclusion by the findings I make later concerning the leaking of the contents of C7%%sqt%%s second bid%%per%%]$~

~$[As the minutes record%%lst%% the confidential nature of the offer was stressed to all those attending the meeting%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In my view%%lst%% this disclosure did not%%lst%% of itself%%lst%% result in the terms of the offer made to the NRL PEC ceasing to be confidential%%per%%

~$[Yes%%lst%% I did%%lst%% yes%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Because it was essential to your plans to have publicised that offer to ensure that support would be forthcoming from the clubs in relation to the details of that offer%%scn%% correct?%%dsh%%%%dsh%%%%dsh%%No%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Then why did you ask Mr Allerton to brief the press about the offer%%lst%% Mr Stokes?%%dsh%%%%dsh%%%%dsh%%Without being aware of what was in the press at that day that I spoke to him%%lst%% I can%%sqt%%t recall%%lst%% Mr Hutley%%per%%]$~ 
~$[I think it may have been a defensive reply that we were making at the time%%sqt%%%%per%% 
2964 Seven points out that Mr Stokes admitted only to instructing Mr Allerton to brief the press about C7%%sqt%%s offer%%lst%% ]n[ to instructing him to divulge the key terms of the offer%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Seven submits that Mr Allerton could have made a %%sqt%% defensive reply %%sqt%% without revealing the terms of the bid%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It relies on Mr Francis%%sqt%% email of 30 November 2000%%lst%% in which he referred to keeping within %%sqt%% the relative confines of commercial confidentiality %%sqt%% ]^[ to the confidentiality of the bid having been %%sqt%% blown by the verbal club presidents %%sqt%%%%per%% 
2965 I think that the likelihood is that%%lst%% whoever was the immediate source ]f[ Mr Hadley%%sqt%%s report on the radio%%lst%% Mr Allerton ]v[ Mr Francis provided Mr Masters ]^[ other journalists with details of C7%%sqt%%s offer of 27 November 2000 ]f[ the NRL pay television rights%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Masters was clearly provided with full details of the bid%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Even %%cmp_if%% a club official was Mr Hadley%%sqt%%s source%%lst%% there is no particular reason to think that the official would have leaked to other journalists detailed information about the bid%%per%%]$~ 
~$[There were obvious advantages to Seven providing details of the bid to a sympathetic journalist%%lst%% who would %%cmp_t%% be very well equipped to convey Seven%%sqt%%s side of the story to the public%%per%%]$~ 
~$[This can be interpreted as Mr Francis regarding any confidentiality previously attaching to the bid as having been superseded%%per%%]$~ 
~$[On the contrary%%lst%% the tone of that email ]^[ that of Mr Francis%%sqt%% email of 4 December 2000 was one of self%%dsh%%satisfaction%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Moreover%%lst%% he had an obvious motive to cause the details of C7%%sqt%%s offer to be released%%lst%% particularly %%cmp_if%% aspects of the bid had already been disclosed by one commentator%%per%%]$~ 
~$[I do ]n[ accept that any instruction by Mr Stokes to Mr Allerton ]v[ Mr Francis required them to maintain the confidentiality of C7%%sqt%%s bid%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Therefore I was deprived of the opportunity to hear from Mr Francis precisely what was conveyed to Mr Masters ]^[ the other journalists by ]v[ on behalf of Seven%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Francis%%sqt%% absence from the witness box makes it easier ]f[ me to draw the inference%%lst%% that is otherwise available on the evidence%%lst%% that he ]v[ Mr Allerton at the very least disclosed to Mr Masters the full details of C7%%sqt%%s bid%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Allerton%%lst%% through City Public Relations Pty Ltd%%lst%% had a monthly retainer from ACE%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Part of his brief was to give journalists background information in the interests of Seven%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The invoices ]f[ Mr Allerton%%sqt%%s work at this time were directed to Seven%%per%%]$~ 
~$[He is plainly within Seven%%sqt%%s camp%%per%%]$~ 
~$[I draw no adverse inference from the disposal of the computer system%%lst%% ]b[ the disposal eliminates the possibility that Mr Allerton ]v[ City Public Relations Pty Ltd retained records which would support Seven%%sqt%%s position%%per%% 
2966 I think it likely that Seven%%lst%% through Mr Stokes%%lst%% Mr Gammell%%lst%% Mr Francis ]^[ Mr Allerton%%lst%% realised prior to the CEOs%%sqt%% meeting that there was a significant risk that one of the club representatives would subsequently divulge information concerning C7%%sqt%%s bid ]f[ the NRL pay television rights%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It is unclear whether a plan was developed in advance to deal with that eventuality%%per%%]$~ 
~$[However%%lst%% when it became apparent that some information had been ]v[ was about to be leaked by a club official%%lst%% Mr Stokes gave authority to Mr Allerton ]^[ Mr Francis to make available to Mr Masters ]^[ other journalists the complete contents of C7%%sqt%%s bid%%per%%]$~ 
~$[This was to be done as part of Seven%%sqt%%s efforts to influence favourable media coverage of C7%%sqt%%s bid ]^[ to create pressure on Fox Sports to offer considerably more to the NRL PEC %%cmp_if%% it wished to secure the NRL pay television rights%%per%% 
2967 On balance%%lst%% I think that the initial leak to Mr Hadley on 30 November came from a club official%%per%%]$~ 
~$[However%%lst%% I find that Mr Allerton ]v[ Mr Francis%%lst%% with Mr Stokes%%sqt%% approval%%lst%% provided full details of C7%%sqt%%s bid to Mr Masters ]^[ other journalists%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The material was duly published%%lst%% as Mr Stokes%%lst%% Mr Allerton ]^[ Mr Francis intended%%per%% 
2968 In these circumstances%%lst%% it is clear that%%lst%% once Mr Masters%%sqt%% article was published%%lst%% the contents of C7%%sqt%%s second bid ]f[ the NRL pay television rights were no longer confidential%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Stokes recognised as much%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%Right%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Now%%lst%% you knew that it was Seven%%sqt%%s position that from 1 December 2000 it was the position of Seven%%lst%% which you were a party to%%lst%% that nothing about the NRL offer was confidential%%scn%% that%%sqt%%s correct%%lst%% isn%%sqt%%t it? 
%%dsh%%%%dsh%%%%dsh%% I accept that nothing from 1 December was confidential%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It had all been covered in that%%lst%% certainly in that article%%lst%% yes%%per%%]$~ 
~$[And you would agree with me that Seven did nothing to establish any new relationship of confidence between it ]^[ the NRL%%lst%% did it? 
%%dsh%%%%dsh%%%%dsh%% Not that I am aware of%%lst%% Mr Hutley%%sqt%%%%per%% 
2969 The second answer given by Mr Stokes in this passage appears to acknowledge the fact that C7%%sqt%%s letter of 5 December 2000%%lst%% containing its third offer ]f[ the NRL pay television rights%%lst%% did ]n[ state that the offer was to be treated as confidential%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The absence of any reservation of confidentiality contrasts with C7%%sqt%%s second offer of 27 November 2000 in which Mr Anderson said%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%We still believe confidentiality to be in the best interests of both parties%%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Stokes agreed that he had been aware of the contents of the 5 December 2000 offer%%lst%% ]b[ denied knowing that the letter made no reference at all to confidentiality%%per%% 
2970 Whether ]v[ ]n[ Mr Stokes realised that the letter made no claim to confidentiality%%lst%% Seven adduced no evidence suggesting that the omission was an oversight ]v[ had been remedied by a subsequent communication to the NRL PEC%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Seven%%sqt%%s submissions do ]n[ offer any convincing reason%%lst%% nor indeed do they refer to any reason grounded in the evidence%%lst%% ]f[ failing to claim confidentiality ]f[ the third offer%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Given the disclosure of C7%%sqt%%s second offer in the media%%lst%% it might have been expected that%%lst%% %%cmp_if%% Seven wished to preserve confidentiality%%lst%% it would have taken some pains to advert expressly in its letter of offer to its desire to preserve confidentiality%%per%% 
2971 I infer that the absence of any reference to confidentiality in C7%%sqt%%s third letter of offer was ]n[ accidental%%per%%]$~ 
~$[This inference is stronger %%cmp_b%% C7%%sqt%%s letters of 6 ]^[ 7 December 2000%%lst%% which clarified elements of C7%%sqt%%s bid%%lst%% were also ]n[ expressed to be confidential%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The absence of any such claim probably reflected a perception by Mr Gammell ]^[ others within Seven that%%lst%% in view of the publication of the details of C7%%sqt%%s second offer ]^[ in view of Seven%%sqt%%s interest in maintaining a public debate about the merits of the competing offers%%lst%% there was no particular point in maintaining confidentiality at this stage of the negotiations%%per%% 
2972 In any event%%lst%% important aspects of C7%%sqt%%s third offer soon found their way into the press%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Masters%%sqt%% article in the Sydney Morning Herald of 7 December 2000 reported that C7 had removed certain demands from its bid%%lst%% ]b[ that it insisted on retaining the %%sqt%% discount %%sqt%% of $1 million ]f[ each additional game televised by Nine%%per%%]$~ 
~$[According to Mr Masters%%lst%% an %%sqt%% insider %%sqt%% had described the clause %%sqt%% as insurance against %%dqt%%an act of bastardry%%dqt%% by Packer %%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The article did ]n[ refer to the fact that Seven%%sqt%%s offer had been reduced in certain respects%%lst%% ]b[ asserted that the %%sqt%% floor price %%sqt%% (that would apply %%cmp_if%% Nine stripped C7 of more NRL games) was higher %%cmp_ta%% the Fox Sports bid%%per%% 
2973 I infer that Mr Allerton ]v[ Mr Francis%%lst%% ]v[ possibly someone %%cmp_e%% from Seven%%lst%% provided to Mr Masters such information relating to C7%%sqt%%s third bid that was thought to be helpful in pushing Seven%%sqt%%s case in the media%%per%%]$~ 
~$[I am assisted in reaching this conclusion by Mr Masters%%sqt%% reference to an %%sqt%% insider %%sqt%% ]^[ by the absence of Mr Allerton ]^[ Mr Francis from the witness box%%per%% 
19%%per%%4%%per%%8%%per%%2 CONCLUSIONS ON CONFIDENTIALITY 
2974 On the basis of these findings%%lst%% the conclusion is inevitable that the contents of C7%%sqt%%s offer of 5 December 2000 ]f[ the NRL pay television rights%%lst%% as communicated to the NRL PEC%%lst%% lacked the quality of confidentiality required to attract the protection of equity%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In any event%%lst%% the information was ]n[ communicated to the NRL PEC in circumstances imparting an obligation of confidentiality on the members%%lst%% including Mr Philip%%per%% 
2975 C7 did ]n[ treat its second bid ]f[ the NRL pay television rights as confidential%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Accepting that the initial leak to Mr Hadley came from one of the club officials%%lst%% Seven was ]n[ compelled to counter the leak by itself leaking the full contents of its bid to other journalists%%per%%]$~ 
~$[As Seven%%sqt%%s own submissions recognise%%lst%% it was ]n[ essential ]f[ C7%%lst%% %%cmp_if%% it wished to make a %%sqt%% defensive reply%%sqt%% %%lst%% to divulge full details of its bid to Mr Masters ]^[ others%%per%%]$~ 
~$[If Seven was genuinely concerned about maintaining the confidentiality of its current ]^[ future bids it could (and presumably would) have explained publicly that the leak had occurred without its authority%%per%%]$~ 
~$[No doubt that course may have created a risk of implicitly confirming the accuracy of the leak%%lst%% depending on the way the complaint was framed%%per%%]$~ 
~$[But taking such a position would have demonstrated Seven%%sqt%%s concern to preserve the confidentiality of the bidding process%%per%% 
2976 Seven relies on the differences between C7%%sqt%%s second ]^[ third offers to support its argument that the disclosure of the terms of the second bid did ]n[ detract from the confidential character of the third bid%%per%%]$~ 
~$[This argument may have carried some weight %%cmp_if%% C7 had expressly reserved confidentiality ]f[ the third bid ]^[ the subsequent written clarification of its terms%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Even that conclusion is doubtful given Seven%%sqt%%s clandestine disclosure of the terms of the second bid%%lst%% at least without Seven %%sqt%% coming clean %%sqt%% about its conduct ]^[ explaining to the NRL PEC why its third bid was nonetheless to be regarded as confidential%%per%% 
2977 Be that as it may%%lst%% Seven deliberately chose to communicate its third offer of 5 December 2000 without claiming confidentiality ]f[ its terms%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It followed the same course in relation to the clarifications of the bid in the letters of 6 ]^[ 7 December 2000%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In short%%lst%% Seven chose to communicate its final offer without attempting to clothe it with confidentiality%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Members of the NRL PEC were entitled to conclude that C7 was no longer concerned about the confidentiality of its bid%%per%% 
2978 Seven also relies on the various expressions of confidentiality by C7 ]^[ Mr Moffett on behalf of the NRL PEC prior to 5 December 2000%%per%%]$~ 
~$[But those expressions were generally directed to particular communications and%%lst%% in any event%%lst%% were plainly overtaken by Seven%%sqt%%s conduct in publicly disclosing the terms of C7%%sqt%%s second bid%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Similarly%%lst%% it is difficult to see the relevance of Seven obtaining signed confidentiality undertakings from executives in mid%%dsh%%November 2000%%lst%% in the light of its subsequent conduct%%per%% 
2979 Seven further says that the bidding process was supposed to be similar to that of a sealed auction where rivals do ]n[ know each other%%sqt%%s bids ]^[ the highest bid wins%%per%%]$~ 
~$[This submission is ]n[ supported by the evidence%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The NRL PEC made it clear to Seven that the bidding process would be conducted entirely at its discretion%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In any event%%lst%% any assumptions about the bidding process had been overtaken by the events which occurred before C7 made the third offer on 5 December 2000%%per%% 
2980 The conclusions expressed thus far have been reached independently of Seven%%sqt%%s disclosure to Mr Masters of aspects of its final bid%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In my opinion%%lst%% this would be enough%%lst%% of itself%%lst%% to deny the quality of confidentiality to the contents of that bid%%per%%]$~ 
~$[At the very least%%lst%% it reinforces the conclusions I have reached%%per%% 
2981 Finally%%lst%% I note that Seven supports its contentions by referring to Mr Macourt%%sqt%%s evidence that he felt constrained at the Fox Sports board meeting of 5 December 2000 ]n[ to confirm the accuracy of the press reports that had appeared concerning the competing bids%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It is ]n[ clear whether Mr Macourt appreciated the circumstances of the disclosures as I have found them to be%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In any event%%lst%% his view at the time cannot alter the significance of the findings of fact I have made%%per%% 
2982 It follows that Seven%%sqt%%s case in breach of confidentiality does ]n[ clear the first hurdle%%per%% 
19%%per%%4%%per%%9 Disclosure of Information Relating to C7%%sqt%%s bid 
2983 Given that Seven%%sqt%%s breach of confidentiality claim fails at the threshold%%lst%% it is ]n[ necessary to consider whether Mr Philip disclosed the allegedly confidential information to Mr Akhurst ]v[ anyone %%cmp_e%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Since the information was ]n[ clothed with the necessary quality of confidentiality%%lst%% it is ]n[ to the point that Mr Philip may in fact have disclosed it in his fax of 9 December 2000 to Mr Akhurst or%%lst%% indeed%%lst%% in some other communication%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Nor is it to the point that Mr Philip may even have believed that the information he was disclosing was confidential%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Nonetheless%%lst%% in view of Mr Philip%%sqt%%s denial that he intended to communicate to Mr Akhurst the substance of C7%%sqt%%s bid of 5 December 2000%%lst%% I think it is appropriate to record a finding on that factual issue%%per%% 
2984 I have already recounted much of the evidence relating to this question in Chapter 9%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It will be recalled that Mr Philip admitted that he asked Mr Akhurst to destroy the latter%%sqt%%s copy of the fax of 9 December 2000 ]^[ I have found that Mr Philip made a similar request to Mr Falloon%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Philip made these requests in order to erase what otherwise would have been a paper trail%%per%%]$~ 
~$[I have recorded Mr Philip%%sqt%%s extraordinary admissions in his third written statement%%lst%% to the effect that a number of representations in the fax were outright lies ]^[ that he had made them in order to persuade Telstra to support a revised bid by Fox Sports ]f[ the NRL pay television rights%%per%% 
2985 In his cross%%dsh%%examination%%lst%% Mr Philip agreed that the admissions in his third written statement amounted to saying that he had%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%intentionally misled Telstra in order to persuade them to commit an extra $13 million to $14 million to fund the bid that [he] believed would go through anyway%%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The purpose of this deception%%lst%% according to Mr Philip%%lst%% was to save News from having to contribute at least $10 million from its own pocket to a revised Fox Sports bid%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Philip reluctantly agreed that %%cmp_if%% his evidence was right%%lst%% ]^[ %%cmp_if%% Telstra was influenced by his statements to support the increased bid%%lst%% %%cmp_t%% it was possible that he had succeeded in defrauding Telstra%%per%% 
2986 Mr Philip%%sqt%%s admissions do ]n[ inspire confidence in his truthfulness%%per%%]$~ 
~$[On his own account%%lst%% he was prepared to tell lies in an attempt to persuade Telstra to contribute funds that otherwise Mr Philip%%sqt%%s employer would have had to contribute to the project%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Whether ]v[ ]n[ this amounted to %%sqt%% fraud %%sqt%%%%lst%% it was disgraceful conduct%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Nonetheless%%lst%% Mr Philip%%sqt%%s admissions of dishonest conduct do ]n[ necessarily mean that he was ]n[ telling the truth in the witness box%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Indeed%%lst%% News submits that Mr Philips%%sqt%% willingness to make admissions against his own interests supports the conclusion that his evidence in the proceedings%%lst%% at least on this point%%lst%% was truthful ]^[ should be accepted%%per%% 
2987 I focus here on Mr Philip%%sqt%%s claim that his fax to Mr Akhurst was ]n[ intended to disclose the terms of C7%%sqt%%s offer of 5 December 2000 to the NRL Partnership%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Philip%%sqt%%s explanation ]f[ setting out in the fax the terms of the %%sqt%% C7 offer we need to beat %%sqt%% was given in par 142 of his first written statement%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%I did ]n[ in paragraph 1 [of the fax of 9 December] disclose the financial figure which appeared from the C7 offer of 5 December 2000 which was $36%%per%%5 million%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In my fax to Bruce Akhurst the $39 million consists of the $34%%dsh%%$35 million ]f[ the rights ]^[ $4 million contra (see paragraph 6 of my fax)%%per%%]$~ 
~$[I did ]n[ treat the $6 million as part of the bid from the NRL%%sqt%%s point of view%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The $6 million was my estimate of the cost to be incurred by Fox Sports in producing the NRL coverage ]b[ which I wanted to count as a contribution by Fox Sports in my argument that Telstra%%sqt%%s contribution of $10 million was less %%cmp_ta%% the contribution which was being made by the Fox Sports shareholders%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In describing the C7 offer in the way that I did I assumed that C7%%sqt%%s production costs would be the same as Fox Sports (that is%%lst%% $6 million) ]^[ that C7 would offer the same level of contra as the Fox Sports offer%%per%%]$~ 
~$[I %%cmp_t%% chose a figure of $33 million ]f[ the rights ]s[ that%%lst%% when added to the $4 million ]^[ the $6 million%%lst%% it was $2 million less %%cmp_ta%% the proposed Fox Sports bid%%sqt%%%%per%% 
2988 It must be said that Mr Philip%%sqt%%s evidence on this issue was by no means easy to follow%%per%%]$~ 
~$[He claimed that the critical figure in his mind%%lst%% at the time he wrote the fax%%lst%% was $39 million per annum%%per%%]$~ 
~$[This figure%%lst%% he said%%lst%% was derived from Mr Masters%%sqt%% article in the Sydney Morning Herald of 1 December 2000%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The article had referred to C7%%sqt%%s %%sqt%% three%%dsh%%tiered deal %%sqt%%%%lst%% the lowest tier of which required $25 million to be paid to the NRL Partnership ]^[ $14 million to the clubs%%per%%]$~ 
~$[According to Mr Philip%%lst%% he felt that Fox Sports had to %%sqt%% measure up %%sqt%% to the expectations in the public mind created by the press articles appearing on ]^[ after 1 December 2000%%per%% 
2989 Mr Philip acknowledged that C7%%sqt%%s second offer of 27 November 2000 was actually ]f[ $39 million cash plus $4 million contra%%per%%]$~ 
~$[He accepted that the explanation given in his first written statement implied that an offer by Fox Sports of $39 million%%lst%% inclusive of contra%%lst%% could be publicly presented %%sqt%% as being in the same ballpark %%sqt%% as C7%%sqt%%s offer of $39 million plus contra%%per%%]$~ 
~$[He reached the figure of $33 million cash per annum ]f[ the rights%%lst%% recorded in par 1 of the fax%%lst%% simply by deducting an arbitrary $2 million from what he regarded as a publicly defensible bid by Fox Sports (that is%%lst%% $35 million cash plus $4 million in contra)%%per%% 
2990 Mr Philip agreed in cross%%dsh%%examination that his practice%%lst%% when analysing offers ]f[ pay television rights%%lst%% was to assess monetary bids exclusive of GST%%per%%]$~ 
~$[He acknowledged that there was ]n[ a single figure in the fax to Mr Akhurst that was inclusive of GST%%per%%]$~

~$[Seven says that the amount payable under C7%%sqt%%s tiered offer depended ]n[ on the number of subscribers taking the C7 service itself%%lst%% ]b[ upon the total number of homes connected to pay television platforms that carried the C7 channels broadcasting NRL content%%per%%]$~

3003 NRL Ltd submits that neither representation in the media release of 14 December 2000 has been shown to be false%%per%%]$~ 
~$[News adopts NRL Ltd%%sqt%%s submissions on behalf of its subsidiary%%lst%% NRLI%%per%% 
3004 NRL Ltd argues that the language of the media release should be understood as conveying an %%sqt%% element of broad approximation %%sqt%% when it referred to the %%sqt%% total value of the deal [being] almost $400 million %%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In any event%%lst%% it says that Seven has failed to identify all the elements in Fox Sports%%sqt%% bid that were advantageous to the NRL Partnership ]^[ accordingly has failed to allocate an appropriate value to each component%%per%%]$~ 
~$[NRL Ltd illustrates this point by reference to what it says is the value of %%sqt%% in%%dsh%%programme promotion %%sqt%% to be provided by Fox Sports%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It points out that Mr Stokes%%lst%% in a letter to the AFL%%lst%% assessed %%sqt%% in%%dsh%%programme promotion %%sqt%% to the AFL as having been worth $30 to $40 million over a period of time%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Once this ]^[ other advantages of the Fox Sports bid are taken into account%%lst%% it was ]n[ inaccurate to describe the %%sqt%% total value %%sqt%% of the deal as amounting to nearly $400 million%%per%% 
3005 NRL Ltd submits that the %%sqt%% guaranteed figure %%sqt%% representation must be understood as referring to the %%sqt%% worst case scenario %%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The worst case would include Nine taking extra free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air NRL games%%per%%]$~

%%sqt%%the bottom line guaranteed figure of Fox Sports was higher %%cmp_ta%% that of the bottom line guaranteed figure of C7%%sqt%%%%per%%

19%%per%%5%%per%%4 Reasoning 
3007 Seven%%sqt%%s submissions do ]n[ identify the source of the Court%%sqt%%s jurisdiction to make declarations%%per%%]$~ 
~$[There is no dispute%%lst%% however%%lst%% that the Court has jurisdiction to make a declaration that a party has acted in a misleading ]v[ deceptive manner%%lst%% in contravention of s 52 of the TP Act%%per%%]$~ 
~$[This is ]s[ even %%cmp_if%% no other relief is sought by ]v[ is available to the applicant%%cln%% Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth)%%lst%% s 21(1) ,(2)%%scn%% Tobacco Institute of Australia Ltd v Australian Federation of Consumer Organisations Inc (No 2) (1993) 41 FCR 89%%lst%% at 97%%dsh%%98%%lst%% per Sheppard J%%scn%% at 108%%dsh%%112%%lst%% per Hill J%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Equally%%lst%% Seven does ]n[ dispute that the declaratory remedy is discretionary%%lst%% in the sense that I am ]n[ obliged to make a declaration even %%cmp_if%% Seven establishes that the two impugned representations in the media release of 14 December 2000 were misleading ]v[ deceptive%%per%% 
3008 It seems to me that there is some force in NRL Ltd%%sqt%%s submission concerning the meaning of the representations conveyed by the press release%%per%%]$~ 
~$[However%%lst%% the short answer to Seven%%sqt%%s claim ]f[ declaratory relief is that%%lst%% even %%cmp_if%% it establishes that the media release of 14 December 2000 contained misleading ]v[ deceptive representations%%lst%% I would refuse%%lst%% in the exercise of my discretion%%lst%% to grant purely declaratory relief%%per%% 
3009 There are circumstances in which an applicant%%lst%% which either does ]n[ seek ]v[ fails in its claim ]f[ other relief%%lst%% nonetheless will succeed in obtaining a declaration that the respondent has engaged in misleading ]v[ deceptive conduct%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Tobacco Institute v AFCO (No 2) was just such a case%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The Full Federal Court dissolved injunctions granted by the trial Judge ( Tobacco Institute of Australia Ltd v Australian Federation of Consumer Organisations Inc ( 1992) 38 FCR 1)%%lst%% ]b[ made a declaration that a portion of an advertisement concerning the effects of passive smoking%%lst%% which had been published seven years earlier%%lst%% had been misleading ]v[ deceptive contrary to the provisions of s 52 of the TP Act%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The Full Court took this course notwithstanding that AFCO had ]n[ sought declaratory relief at first instance ]^[ had applied to amend its claim ]f[ relief only after the Full Court delivered its first judgment%%per%% 
3010 Sheppard J%%lst%% with whom Foster J agreed%%lst%% pointed out (41 FCR%%lst%% at 100) that the question whether the advertisement was misleading ]v[ deceptive had been the central issue at the trial which had %%sqt%% lasted ]f[ many months %%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[All four Judges dealing with the issue had firmly rejected the Tobacco Institute%%sqt%%s contention that the advertisement was ]n[ misleading ]v[ deceptive%%per%%]$~ 
~$[According to Sheppard J%%cln%% 
[t]hat being the case%%lst%% it would seem quite undesirable to me that%%lst%% in a matter involving as it does the public interest %%dsh%%%%dsh%%%%dsh%% really the public health ]^[ well%%dsh%%being of the nation %%dsh%%%%dsh%%%%dsh%% the court having reached its conclusion should ]n[ formally indicate the result of the litigation by an appropriate declaration of right%%sqt%%%%per%% 
3011 Until very late in these proceedings%%lst%% Seven sought damages in respect of the allegedly misleading ]v[ deceptive representation in the media release of 14 December 2000%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It did ]n[ ultimately press that claim (so I infer) %%cmp_b%% it recognised that the evidence did ]n[ establish the elements of reliance ]^[ causation necessary to make out a claim ]f[ damages under s 82 of the TP Act%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In other words%%lst%% Seven failed to prove the elements essential to demonstrating that it had suffered loss ]v[ damage by reason of the allegedly misleading ]v[ deceptive conduct%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Unlike the applicant in Tobacco Institute v AFCO (No 2)%%lst%% Seven did ]n[ litigate this cause of action in the interests of the wider community%%lst%% ]b[ in its own interests%%per%%]$~ 
~$[There is%%lst%% of course%%lst%% no reason why Seven should ]n[ act in its own interests%%lst%% ]b[ its motivation needs to be borne in mind when considering whether it is in the public interest (as Seven claims) that purely declaratory relief should now be granted%%per%% 
3012 The forensic reality is that when Seven abandoned its claim ]f[ damages in respect of this cause of action%%lst%% it sought to salvage something by pressing its claim ]f[ a declaration%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In support of its position%%lst%% Seven invoked the public interest in the Court expressing its disapproval of the NRL Partnership%%sqt%%s conduct in issuing a media release containing misleading representations%%per%%]$~ 
~$[No doubt it can always be said that there may be some value%%lst%% however small%%lst%% in the Court expressing its disapproval of conduct which contravenes s 52 of the TP Act%%per%%]$~ 
~$[But%%lst%% in my view%%lst%% that does ]n[ foreclose the question of whether the Court%%lst%% as a matter of discretion%%lst%% should grant a declaration without the applicant pressing any claim ]f[ other relief%%per%% 
3013 The media release was published two years before these proceedings were commenced ]^[ more %%cmp_ta%% six years before delivery of this judgment%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Few people would remember an advertisement which was part of a public relations battle fought long ago ]^[ which has well ]^[ truly been overtaken by events%%lst%% ]n[ least the award in 2005 of the NRL pay television rights ]f[ the period 2007 to 2011%%per%%]$~ 
~$[No evidence was led to establish that anyone reading the advertisement suffered any financial loss ]v[ significant detriment%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It is true%%lst%% as Mr Sheahan submitted%%lst%% that the media release was issued to the public at large%%per%%]$~ 
~$[But given the lapse of time%%lst%% the absence (so far as the evidence goes) of any apparent adverse effect on the clubs ]v[ those interested in the NRL ]^[ the reallocation of the NRL pay television rights in 2005%%lst%% it is hard to see how a declaration issued by the Court at this stage could have any significant practical utility%%per%% 
3014 I mention two other points%%per%%]$~ 
~$[First%%lst%% the media release representations played only a minor part in these proceedings%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Had Seven ]n[ incorporated its claim ]f[ declaratory relief into the multitude of causes of action pleaded in the statement of claim%%lst%% it is difficult to believe that Seven would have been sufficiently troubled by the media release to bring proceedings ]f[ a declaration based solely on account of the contents of that document%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Seven%%lst%% after all%%lst%% was far from helpless in any public relations contest%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Secondly%%lst%% Seven maintains other claims ]f[ relief against the NRL Partnership founded on alleged contraventions of s 52 of the TP Act%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The denial of declaratory relief in respect of the media release does ]n[ affect the pursuit of claims which do have practical utility%%per%% 
3015 A third point%%lst%% although I would have reached my conclusion in any event%%lst%% is that I do ]n[ regard it as in the public interest that a party%%lst%% especially an applicant in mega%%dsh%%litigation%%lst%% should be able to insist on the Court resolving every factual issue it chooses to present%%lst%% no matter how devoid of practical significance that issue may be%%per%%]$~ 
~$[There is a strong public interest in the limited resources of the Court being directed to the resolution of disputes that truly matter%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Perhaps it is time courts recognised this point more robustly%%per%% 
3016 In my view%%lst%% there would be little ]v[ no utility in granting declaratory relief to Seven in respect of any misleading ]v[ deceptive conduct involved in the issue of the media release of 14 December 2000%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Therefore%%lst%% on the assumption that Seven could establish the misleading ]^[ deceptive character of the representations of the media release%%lst%% I would decline in the exercise of my discretion to make a declaration to that effect%%per%%

3019 Seven pleads that%%lst%% at the time the fair process representation was made%%lst%% neither the NRL Partnership nor NRL Ltd had reasonable grounds ]f[ making the representation ]^[ to that end it relies on the deeming effect of s 51A of the TP Act (par 498)%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Alternatively%%lst%% Seven alleges that%%lst%% subsequent to the making of the fair process representation%%lst%% the NRL Partnership (or alternatively NRL Ltd) engaged in conduct inconsistent with the representation%%per%%]$~

19%%per%%6%%per%%4 ARL%%sqt%%s Submissions 
3041 ARL adopts the submissions of News%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In addition%%lst%% it makes supplementary submissions%%per%% 
3042 ARL contends that there is no basis ]f[ concluding that any statements made by Messrs Love%%lst%% Politis ]^[ Hill were made on behalf of the NRL Partnership ]v[ NRL Ltd%%per%%]$~ ~$[ARL submits%%lst%% on the contrary%%lst%% that the Seven representatives were well aware that Messrs Love%%lst%% Politis ]^[ Hill could ]n[ have been speaking on behalf of News ]v[ the News appointees to the NRL PEC%%per%% 
3043 ARL submits that Seven is incorrect in suggesting that Fox Sports%%sqt%% offer was known by the NRL Partnership to be inferior%%per%%]$~ 
~$[According to ARL%%lst%% there was nothing unrealistic about assuming that the lowest payment tier in C7%%sqt%%s offer would apply%%lst%% ]v[ that Nine would take additional NRL matches on its free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air channel%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Moreover%%lst%% ARL contends that Seven is precluded from relying on a number of additional matters it claims demonstrate that the acceptance of Fox Sports%%sqt%% offer was ]n[ based on a fair ]^[ impartial comparison of the two competing bids%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The reason given by ARL is that the matters relied on by Seven fall outside the scope of the pleadings%%per%% 
3044 ARL also says that %%cmp_if%%%%lst%% contrary to its submissions%%lst%% the Court finds that the fair process representation was made on behalf of the NRL Partnership%%lst%% evidence was adduced suggesting that the NRL Partnership had reasonable grounds ]f[ making the representation%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The adducing of that evidence means that s 51A(2) of the TP Act %%lst%% as a matter of construction%%lst%% does ]n[ operate to deem the representation to have been made without reasonable grounds%%per%%]$~ 
~$[According to ARL%%lst%% the onus of establishing lack of reasonable grounds rests with Seven ]^[ has ]n[ been discharged by it%%per%% 
3045 Finally%%lst%% ARL criticises Seven%%sqt%%s damages case on the ground that it converts a lost opportunity of participating in a fair bidding process into a certainty that its offer would have been accepted%%per%%]$~ 
~$[ARL also argues that there is no evidence as to what the NRL clubs would have done had Seven informed them of the departure from the fair process representation%%per%% 
19%%per%%6%%per%%5 Reasoning 
19%%per%%6%%per%%5%%per%%1 REPRESENTATION AS A CONSTRUCT 
3046 It seems to me that there is force in the Respondents%%sqt%% criticism of the way in which Seven seeks to construct a single fair process representation out of seven discrete conversations%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The fair process representation is said to emerge from interchanges between different people that took place in different words ]^[ in different contexts%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In order to accommodate the differences%%lst%% Seven formulates a representation in general terms (that C7%%sqt%%s offer would be treated in a fair ]^[ impartial manner)%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Yet on Seven%%sqt%%s own case%%lst%% the representation ]s[ formulated does ]n[ correspond precisely with the language used in any of the conversations%%per%% 
3047 Seven %%cmp_t%%%%lst%% in substance%%lst%% interprets the representation it has formulated to give rise to what News aptly enough describes as %%sqt%% imputations %%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[These are employed to support Seven%%sqt%%s submission that the NRL PEC departed from the representation by deciding to accept Fox Sports%%sqt%% offer%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It is ]n[ easy to see%%lst%% ]f[ example%%lst%% why the various statements on which Seven relies constituted a representation that the News representatives on the NRL PEC would ]n[ participate in the decision to award the NRL pay television rights%%lst%% ]v[ would declare a conflict of interest %%cmp_if%% they did (as Seven%%sqt%%s submissions appear to suggest)%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Even the responses Mr Gammell claimed were made to his query concerning a potential conflict of interest did ]n[ go that far%%per%%]$~ 
~$[No doubt an undeclared conflict of interest on the part of a decision%%dsh%%maker might indicate that the decision%%dsh%%making process is ]n[ being carried out in a %%sqt%% fair ]^[ impartial manner %%sqt%%%%lst%% depending on what that expression%%lst%% read in context%%lst%% means%%per%%]$~ 
~$[But the expression is Seven%%sqt%%s%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It was ]n[ used by the alleged representators%%per%% 
3048 I am doubtful whether%%lst%% even %%cmp_if%% the conversations alleged by Seven took place in precisely the terms it pleads%%lst%% the fair process representation would be made out%%per%%]$~ 
~$[However%%lst%% in view of other findings I make it is ]n[ necessary finally to resolve this question%%per%% 
19%%per%%6%%per%%5%%per%%2 WERE THE ALLEGED STATEMENTS MADE? 
3049 In assessing the evidence concerning the seven statements relied on by Seven%%lst%% three matters must be borne in mind%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The first is that ]n[ one of the statements is supported by contemporaneous documentation%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The evidence supporting the making of the statements consists exclusively of evidence of oral exchanges%%lst%% unaided by notes made at ]v[ near the time the conversation allegedly occurred%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Moreover%%lst%% there is ]n[ a single example of any of the seven alleged statements being confirmed ]v[ recorded in contemporaneous correspondence prepared by ]v[ on behalf of C7 ]v[ Seven Network%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Secondly%%lst%% there is no evidence that anyone at Seven complained that the conduct of the NRL PEC departed from representations made earlier on behalf of the NRL Partnership%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Thirdly%%lst%% it is very difficult to reconcile the evidence given by Mr Stokes ]^[ Mr Gammell%%lst%% in particular%%lst%% with the correspondence passing between Seven ]^[ the NRL PEC (or NRL Ltd acting on behalf of the NRL PEC)%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Wood asserted in the fax%%lst%% however%%lst%% that Mr Moffett had stated that the NRL PEC would act independently in the best interests of the NRL ]^[ the clubs when assessing offers ]f[ the pay television rights%%per%% 
(The conversation between Mr Wood ]^[ Mr Moffett is ]n[ one of those relied on by Seven%%per%%]$~ 
~$[However%%lst%% on 17 November 2000%%lst%% Mr Anderson recorded in a fax to Mr Moffett that Seven expected %%sqt%% impartiality to be an important part of the process %%sqt%% ]^[ that it also expected that those directors with a conflict of interest would ]n[ participate in the decision%%dsh%%making%%per%%]$~ 
~$[On 20 November%%lst%% Mr Moffett placed on record that%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%we are ]n[ concerned about any conflict of interest issues in the consideration of your offer%%sqt%% %%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Wood also accepted that he had passed on the substance of this conversation to Mr Gammell%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Moffett%%sqt%%s unequivocal statement in the conversation is hardly consistent with the fair process representation%%per%%]$~ 
~$[He claimed to have maintained this belief until the rights were actually awarded%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Yet later in his evidence Mr Stokes agreed that he had always expected that%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%each of the owners of the NRL rights would take an active part in the process leading to the disposition of the rights%%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[He also agreed that this was a matter totally %%sqt%% ]f[ the rugby league partners %%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[His later evidence is ]n[ easy to reconcile with his earlier evidence%%per%% 
%%dsh%%%%dsh%%%%dsh%% Yes%%per%%]$~ 
~$[You were never in any doubt that News Limited was going to take that course%%scn%% correct? 
%%dsh%%%%dsh%%%%dsh%% That they were going to vote%%lst%% that%%sqt%%s correct%%sqt%%%%per%% 
19%%per%%6%%per%%5%%per%%3 REPRESENTATIONS ALLEGEDLY MADE TO MR STOKES 
3052 In addition to the matters to which I have referred%%lst%% there are serious difficulties in the path of Seven%%sqt%%s contention that I should accept Mr Stokes%%sqt%% account of the three conversations in which he says representations were made to him%%per%%]$~ 
~$[He conceded that at least until the end of September he was confident that Seven would reacquire the AFL pay television rights%%per%%]$~ 
~$[While he subsequently sought to retreat from this admission%%lst%% his retreat was unconvincing%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It is %%cmp_tf%% unlikely that he commenced a conversation at this time by stating that Seven wished to make a very serious offer to buy the NRL pay television rights%%per%%]$~ 
~$[No offer was in fact made by Seven until 13 November 2000%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Nor was the assurance mentioned in any correspondence with the NRL%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Specifically%%lst%% it was ]n[ mentioned in the letter Mr Wood sent to Mr Moffett on 19 October 2000 making inquiries about the NRL pay television rights%%per%%]$~ 
~$[While I do ]n[ regard as decisive the fact that Mr Stokes himself did ]n[ make notes at the time%%lst%% the absence of any reference to the assurance in the correspondence is telling%%per%%]$~ 
~$[None of the three gave evidence supporting Mr Stokes%%sqt%% recollection%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It is true%%lst%% as Seven submits%%lst%% that Mr Stokes%%sqt%% evidence as to who he told arose in cross%%dsh%%examination%%per%%]$~ 
~$[But there was nothing to prevent Seven adducing evidence from Messrs Anderson%%lst%% Wood ]^[ Gammell on the point or%%lst%% %%cmp_if%% necessary%%lst%% seeking leave to do so%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Stokes also claimed in both his statement ]^[ oral evidence that Mr Love confirmed at the outset of the conversation that he was in charge of the NRL%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In fact%%lst%% Mr Love was chairman of directors of ARL ]^[ a member of the NRL PEC%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It is unlikely that Mr Love would have mis%%dsh%%stated his own position%%per%%]$~ 
~$[His account in his written statement implies that Mr Love made the suggestion%%per%%]$~ 
~$[His oral evidence is consistent with that implication%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Later%%lst%% however%%lst%% Mr Stokes attributed the idea to Mr Anderson ]^[ Mr Gammell%%lst%% denying that he had had a discussion on the topic with anybody from the NRL%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Nonetheless he subsequently asserted that his written statement was correct ]^[ that his earlier oral evidence was incorrect%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Anderson%%sqt%%s evidence was that it was likely that he had told Mr Stokes of the positions Mr Love in fact occupied%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Anderson did ]n[ give evidence corroborating Mr Stokes%%sqt%% account of the conversation%%per%% 
3055 Thirdly%%lst%% in relation to the conversation between Mr Stokes ]^[ Messrs Hill ]^[ Politis%%lst%% said to have taken place on 25 November 2000%%lst%% it is significant that in the witness box Mr Stokes%%lst%% although able to recall aspects of the conversation%%lst%% could ]n[ remember the contents insofar as they related to conflicts of interest on the NRL PEC%%per%%]$~ 
~$[His cross%%dsh%%examination includes the following passage%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%You had no recollection of the detail of what appears in paragraph 17 of your statement %%per%%%%per%%%%per%% do you? 
%%dsh%%%%dsh%%%%dsh%% Not without referring to it%%lst%% no%%per%%]$~ 
~$[You know that that paragraph purports to set out a conversation of some length? 
%%dsh%%%%dsh%%%%dsh%% Yes%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Correct? 
%%dsh%%%%dsh%%%%dsh%% Yes%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In fact%%lst%% you know that it covers two ]^[ a bit pages of purported conversation%%scn%% do you see that? 
%%dsh%%%%dsh%%%%dsh%% Yes%%per%%]$~ 
~$[You know that that attributes pretty specific things to various individuals%%scn%% correct? 
%%dsh%%%%dsh%%%%dsh%% Yes%%per%%]$~ 
~$[You have no recollection of that as you sit here today at all%%lst%% correct%%lst%% beyond that which you have told his Honour? 
%%dsh%%%%dsh%%%%dsh%% That is correct%%sqt%%%%per%% 
3056 It is also significant%%lst%% in my view%%lst%% that Mr Stokes ultimately conceded that he knew that the owners of the NRL pay television rights would actively participate in the process leading to their disposition%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Seven submits that this concession can be understood as consistent with Mr Stokes%%sqt%% evidence that he believed the News nominees would ]n[ participate in the decision%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In fact%%lst%% Mr Stokes said in his evidence that he did ]n[ expect the News nominees to play any part in the decision%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In my view%%lst%% Mr Stokes%%sqt%% concession does ]n[ sit easily with his account of the conversation with Messrs Hill ]^[ Politis%%per%% 
3057 I am far from satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the conversations recounted by Mr Stokes%%lst%% insofar as they are relied on by Seven to support the fair process representation%%lst%% took place%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It is possible that Mr Stokes had conversations with the people he identifies at about the times he recalls%%per%%]$~ 
~$[But I am ]n[ persuaded that any conversations that took place included the assurances ]v[ representations on which Seven relies%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Stokes%%sqt%% evidence on these issues was sketchy%%lst%% inconsistent%%lst%% unconvincing and%%lst%% in many respects%%lst%% quite implausible%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It was unsupported by documentary evidence and%%lst%% indeed%%lst%% at odds with contemporaneous records%%per%% 
3058 In reaching this conclusion%%lst%% I have taken into account the fact that none of the other parties to the alleged conversations was called to give evidence%%per%%]$~ 
~$[As I have explained %%cmp_e%%where%%lst%% while this is a consideration that must be given due weight%%lst%% the failure to call these witnesses does ]n[ compel me to accept Mr Stokes%%sqt%% account of the conversations%%per%% 
19%%per%%6%%per%%6 Four Additional Alleged Representations 
3059 Seven relies on four conversations to which Mr Stokes was ]n[ a party to support the fair process representation%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The first of these is the conversation that took place on 13 November 2000 at which Mr Moffett is alleged to have assured Mr Anderson that he had responsibility to %%sqt%% get the best possible deal ]f[ Rugby League %%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Anderson accepted in his cross%%dsh%%examination that he understood Mr Moffett to be conveying no more %%cmp_ta%% that he was charged with the responsibility ]f[ obtaining offers ]f[ the rights ]^[ that the ultimate decision would be one ]f[ the NRL Partnership%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Given that this meeting occurred soon after Mr Moffett%%sqt%%s letter of 8 November 2000%%lst%% Mr Anderson%%sqt%%s evidence is ]n[ surprising%%per%%]$~ 
~$[That evidence is consistent with the fact that Mr Anderson%%lst%% in his letter to Mr Moffett sent very soon after the meeting%%lst%% made no mention of any assurance given at the meeting%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Indeed%%lst%% Mr Moffett%%sqt%%s response to that letter reiterated that an extension of time ]f[ making an offer would be granted %%sqt%% on the same basis as stated in my letter of 8 November %%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Accordingly%%lst%% I cannot accept that anything was said at the meeting of 13 November 2000 that supports the fair process representation%%per%% 
3060 The second of the four additional conversations%%lst%% according to Seven%%lst%% took place in Sydney in mid%%dsh%%November ]v[ early December 2000%%lst%% when either Mr Love ]v[ Mr Politis told Mr Gammell that the NRL would follow a fair ]^[ independent process%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Gammell ]^[ Mr Anderson (who was also at the meeting) gave conflicting evidence on important points%%per%% 
3061 One such point was the date of the meeting%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Gammell was in Perth from 17 November to 3 December 2000%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In his third statement%%lst%% Mr Gammell placed the meeting on 14 ]v[ 15 November 2000%%lst%% before C7 made its first offer on 16 November 2000%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In his cross%%dsh%%examination%%lst%% Mr Gammell said he was certain that the meeting had taken place before 30 November 2000 which%%lst%% %%cmp_if%% correct%%lst%% means it could ]n[ have occurred after 16 November 2000 (since Mr Gammell was ]n[ in Sydney)%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Anderson%%lst%% however%%lst%% said that the meeting took place after C7%%sqt%%s second offer was made to the NRL Partnership on 27 November 2000%%per%%]$~ 
~$[He accepted that it was possible that the meeting had occurred on 4 December 2000%%lst%% after Mr Gammell%%sqt%%s return to Sydney%%per%% 
3062 The differences as to the date of the meeting are ]n[ merely trivial%%lst%% ]f[ two reasons%%per%%]$~ 
~$[First%%lst%% Mr Gammell ]^[ Mr Anderson gave conflicting accounts of what was discussed at the meeting%%per%%]$~ 
~$[According to Mr Anderson%%lst%% Mr Love had before him a copy of C7%%sqt%%s offer ]^[ discussion took place concerning C7%%sqt%%s %%sqt%% subscriber based offer %%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Gammell%%lst%% on the other hand%%lst%% denied that the offer had been discussed at all and%%lst%% indeed%%lst%% it could ]n[ have been had the meeting taken place in mid%%dsh%%November 2000%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Secondly%%lst%% %%cmp_if%% the meeting was held after 27 November 2000%%lst%% any representation could ]n[ have influenced the making of the first two offers by C7 ]f[ the NRL pay television rights%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Although it is ]n[ critical to my finding as to the contents of this conversation%%lst%% I think that Mr Anderson is more likely to be correct in his recollection as to the timing of the meeting%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The date of 4 December 2000 is supported by emails of 1 December 2000 which refer to a forthcoming meeting with the NRL%%lst%% involving both Mr Gammell ]^[ Mr Anderson%%per%% 
3063 Mr Gammell conceded that certain aspects of his recollection as to what was said at the meeting may have been faulty%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Anderson%%sqt%%s account of the meeting did ]n[ include the statements attributed by Mr Gammell to Mr Politis ]v[ Mr Love%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Having regard to these matters%%lst%% to the evidence to which I have referred ]^[ to the absence of any contemporaneous record of this conversation%%lst%% I am ]n[ prepared to accept Mr Gammell%%sqt%%s account of the statements made by Mr Politis ]v[ Mr Love at least%%lst%% insofar as those statements are relied on by Seven to support the making of the fair process representation%%per%% 
3064 The third of the four conversations is said to have taken place between 21 November ]^[ 5 December 2000%%lst%% in the course of which Mr Moffett told Mr Wood that the News bloc was balanced by other members who would make a rational decision%%per%% 
(Contrary to Seven%%sqt%%s Closing Submissions%%lst%% Mr Wood%%sqt%%s account did ]n[ refer to any conflict of interest%%per%% 
) Even %%cmp_if%% Mr Wood%%sqt%%s account of the conversation is accepted%%lst%% I do ]n[ think the comment supports the fair process representation%%per%% 
3065 The final conversation on which Seven relies occurred on 4 December 2000%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It is difficult to understand how Mr Gammell%%sqt%%s account of what was said by Mr Moffett ]v[ Mr Gallop supports the making of the fair process representation%%per%%]$~ 
~$[After all%%lst%% on Mr Gammell%%sqt%%s own account%%lst%% Mr Moffett ]v[ Mr Gammell said that they ]^[ no%%dsh%%one %%cmp_e%% would decide what was in the best interests of the NRL ]^[ that they would work out how the media rights would be sold%%per%% 
19%%per%%6%%per%%7 Authority 
3066 Although it is ]n[ necessary to do so%%lst%% I shall briefly address the question of whether any statements made by Messrs Love%%lst%% Politis ]v[ Hill were made on behalf of the NRL Partnership ]v[ NRL Ltd%%per%%]$~ ~$[Two matters should be borne in mind%%per%%]$~ 
~$[First%%lst%% Seven%%sqt%%s pleaded case does ]n[ allege that any of the statements was made on behalf of ARL%%lst%% otherwise %%cmp_ta%% in ARL%%sqt%%s capacity as a member of the NRL Partnership%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Secondly%%lst%% the question of authority has to be considered on the assumption%%lst%% contrary to my findings%%lst%% that the statements allegedly made by Messrs Love%%lst%% Politis ]^[ Hill were in fact made%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The inference is that C7 perceived an advantage in creating a division between two %%sqt%% independent camps %%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Gammell also accepted that nothing said by Messrs Love ]^[ Politis at the meeting was said on behalf of a News company ]v[ the News appointees to the NRL PEC%%per%% 
3068 ARL submits that C7%%sqt%%s representatives were intent on ascertaining how ARL ]v[ its representatives would act as one of the partners in the NRL Partnership%%per%%]$~ 
~$[They were ]n[ concerned to ascertain how the NRL Partnership ]v[ the NRL PEC would act%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Thus %%cmp_if%%%%lst%% ]f[ example%%lst%% Mr Love told Mr Stokes that the best bid would win%%lst%% he was merely expressing a view as to how ARL representatives on the NRL PEC would view the bids ]^[ was ]n[ making any commitment on behalf of the NRL Partnership%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Similarly%%lst%% anything said by Messrs Politis ]v[ Hill to Mr Stokes at his home on 25 November 2000 could only have been said on behalf of interests independent of News%%per%% 
3069 Seven points out that Mr Love was a director of ARL ]^[ a member of the NRL PEC ]^[ probably had a power of attorney from ARL to do things ]^[ execute documents on its behalf (as contemplated by the NRL Partnership Agreement)%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Seven also points out that%%lst%% on Mr Stokes%%sqt%% account%%lst%% Mr Love had confirmed that he was in charge of %%sqt%% the NRL %%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It follows%%lst%% ]s[ Seven argues%%lst%% that Mr Love had the express ]v[ implied authority of the NRL partners (ARL ]^[ NRLI) to make the statements he did%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Alternatively%%lst%% Seven contends that Mr Love had the apparent authority of the NRL partners to make the statements to Seven%%per%% 
3070 Seven advances similar contentions in relation to Mr Politis%%lst%% except that there is no suggestion that Mr Politis purported to be in charge of ]v[ to represent %%sqt%% the NRL %%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Seven also says that Mr Politis%%lst%% by participating in a meeting with Mr Hill ]^[ Mr Stokes%%lst%% represented to Mr Stokes that Mr Hill had authority to make statements about the NRL pay television rights bidding process on behalf of the NRL Partnership%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It argues that Mr Hill had express ]v[ implied authority as a director of ARL ]^[ NRL Ltd to make the statements he did on behalf of the NRL Partnership%%per%% 
3071 The general structure of the NRL Partnership ]^[ the role ]^[ composition of the NRL PEC have been addressed %%cmp_e%%where ([252]ff)%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The NRL Partnership Agreement provided that the partners (ARL ]^[ NRLI) agreed to conduct the %%sqt%% Business %%sqt%% (that is%%lst%% the business of owning ]^[ operating the NRL Competition) (cl 3%%per%%1)%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Each partner held an equal interest in the NRL Partnership (cll 6%%per%%2%%lst%% 6%%per%%3)%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Each partner was to appoint three members of the NRL PEC%%lst%% the decisions of which were binding on the partners (cl 5%%per%%1)%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The Chairman of the NRL PEC was to be nominated by each partner in alternate years%%lst%% ]b[ was ]n[ to have a casting vote (cl 5%%per%%5)%%per%% 
3072 The NRL PEC was to%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%have sole power ]^[ authority to give all approvals ]^[ to make all decisions ]^[ determinations by the Partners under this Agreement%%sqt%% (cl 5%%per%%7) %%per%%]$~ 
~$[The NRL PEC could delegate its powers (cl 5%%per%%7)%%per%%]$~ 
~$[However%%lst%% certain powers were %%sqt%% exclusive ]^[ non%%dsh%%delegable %%sqt%% (cl 5%%per%%8)%%per%%]$~ 
~$[These included decisions with respect to%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%the entry into%%lst%% amendment ]v[ termination of any contracts in relation to Key Revenue Rights%%sqt%% (cl 5%%per%%8(d))%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The expression %%sqt%% Key Revenue Rights %%sqt%% was defined to mean %%sqt%% all media%%lst%% sponsorship ]^[ merchandising rights %%per%%%%per%%%%per%% in relation to the NRL Competition %%sqt%% (cl 1%%per%%1)%%per%% 
3073 Seven%%sqt%%s submissions do ]n[ address the specific provisions of the NRL Partnership Agreement%%lst%% in particular the clauses governing the composition%%lst%% voting procedures ]^[ the exclusive power ]^[ authority of the NRL PEC%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In the light of these provisions%%lst%% it is difficult to see how Messrs Love ]v[ Politis%%lst%% let alone Mr Hill (who was ]n[ a member of the NRL PEC)%%lst%% could have had actual authority to make representations on behalf of the NRL Partnership as to the decision%%dsh%%making process to be used in connection with the allocation of the NRL pay television rights%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Any decision with respect to the NRL pay television rights was entrusted exclusively to the NRL PEC%%lst%% the members of which were appointed equally by each partner%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The structure of the NRL PEC recognised that there might well be disagreements between the partners as to such decisions ]^[ that these would need to be resolved within the decision%%dsh%%making processes of the NRL PEC laid down in the NRL Partnership Agreement%%per%% 
3074 It is equally difficult to see how statements made by Messrs Love%%lst%% Politis ]v[ Hill can be said to have been made with the ostensible authority of the NRL Partnership%%lst%% as distinct from that of ARL%%per%%]$~ 
~$[A representation by a person that he ]v[ she has authority to bind another does ]n[ of itself create ostensible authority%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The relevant principle is stated in Crabtree Vickers Pty Ltd v Australian Direct Mail Advertising ]^[ Addressing Co Pty Ltd [1975] HCA 49 %%scn%% (1975) 133 CLR 72%%lst%% at 78%%lst%% per Gibbs%%lst%% Mason ]^[ Jacobs JJ%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%There are circumstances where the actual representation of authority may be made by the agent ]b[ in such cases it will be found that the relevant representation is made by the principal (or by the person to whom the principal has given actual authority) either by a previous course of dealing ]v[ by putting the agent in a position ]v[ by allowing him to act in a position from which it can be inferred that his actual representation of authority in himself is in fact correct%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It is %%cmp_tf%% always necessary to look at the conduct of the principal (or the person to whom he has actually delegated authority)%%sqt%%%%per%%]$~

3075 No doubt Mr Moffett ]^[ Mr Gallop were clothed with authority to make representations on behalf of the NRL Partnership%%per%%]$~ 
~$[But the NRL Partnership does ]n[ appear to have done anything that could be regarded as clothing the three directors of ARL to speak on its behalf%%per%% 
3076 This conclusion is reinforced by the understanding of Mr Stokes ]^[ Mr Gammell of the structure of the NRL Partnership%%per%%]$~ 
~$[By 20 November 2000%%lst%% when Mr Gammell saw the letter from Mr Moffett to Mr Anderson responding to C7%%sqt%%s first offer%%lst%% he knew ]^[ understood the structure of the NRL Partnership ]^[ the NRL PEC%%per%%]$~ 
~$[He was also well aware of the potential ]f[ C7 to create a division between the NRL partners and%%lst%% indeed%%lst%% formulated the proposal ]f[ the sharing of revenue with the clubs partly in order to generate just such a division%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Before the meeting at his home on 25 November 2000%%lst%% Mr Stokes had been told by Mr Gammell that the NRL was controlled by a board which included three News representative ]^[ three people %%sqt%% independent of News %%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Although Mr Gammell%%sqt%%s knowledge was more detailed %%cmp_ta%% that of Mr Stokes%%lst%% neither Mr Gammell nor Mr Stokes suffered from any misapprehension as to the relationship between the NRL Partnership ]^[ ARL nominees on the NRL PEC%%per%%

~$[Neither Mr Love nor Mr Politis was a director of NRL%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Seven%%sqt%%s submissions do ]n[ explain why NRL should be understood to have clothed Mr Love ]^[ Mr Politis with authority to make representations to Seven on NRL%%sqt%%s behalf%%per%%

~$[As a consequence of this breach%%lst%% Optus could ]n[ ascertain ]f[ itself when its right to terminate the C7%%dsh%%Optus CSA arose and%%lst%% accordingly%%lst%% decided to enter into the First ]^[ Second Variation Agreements%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Optus %%cmp_tf%% suffered loss ]^[ damage equivalent to any judgment to which Seven would otherwise be entitled (pars 29%%dsh%%35)%%per%%

~$[At common law%%lst%% a false representation may ]n[ be actionable unless the representation is of fact%%lst%% rather %%cmp_ta%% a representation as to the law ]v[ an expression of opinion%%cln%% Heydon v NRMA Ltd [2000] NSWCA 374 %%scn%% (2000) 51 NSWLR 1%%lst%% at 108 [329]%%lst%% per Malcolm AJA%%scn%% at 148 [431]%%lst%% per McPherson AJA%%scn%% Inn Leisure Industries Pty Ltd v D F McCloy Pty Ltd (No 1) (1991) 28 FCR 151%%lst%% at 165 per French J%%per%%]$~

20%%per%%2%%per%%4 What Representations Were Conveyed? 
3101 In determining what representations%%lst%% %%cmp_if%% any%%lst%% were conveyed by Mr Wood%%sqt%%s letters%%lst%% the context must be considered%%per%%]$~ 
~$[On 30 January 2001%%lst%% three months before Mr Wood sent his letter%%lst%% Optus had asked C7 whether it agreed that the right to terminate available under cl 16%%per%%2 of the C7%%dsh%%Optus CSA could arise only from the end of the 2001 AFL season%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Wood%%sqt%%s letter was a belated response to that query%%per%%]$~ 
~$[When he sent the letter%%lst%% Mr Wood could ]n[ have known of the content of Optus%%sqt%% legal advice ]v[ indeed whether Optus had obtained advice%%per%%]$~ 
~$[But the terms of his letter show that Mr Wood fully appreciated that the timing of Optus%%sqt%% right to terminate the C7%%dsh%%Optus CSA depended on the terms of the AFL%%dsh%%Seven Licence%%per%%]$~ 
~$[As Mr Wood realised%%lst%% the right to terminate arose under the C7%%dsh%%Optus CSA when C7 ]v[ a related body %%sqt%% does ]n[ have%%lst%% ]v[ loses%%lst%% the pay television rights to AFL games ]f[ any reason %%sqt%% (cl 16%%per%%2(a))%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Whether Seven no longer had%%lst%% ]v[ had lost%%lst%% the rights depended on the effect of the AFL%%dsh%%Seven Licence%%lst%% since it governed the duration of Seven%%sqt%%s pay television rights to AFL games%%per%% 
3102 Curiously enough%%lst%% by 1 May 2001 Optus had ]n[ asked Seven ]f[ a copy of the AFL%%dsh%%Seven Licence in order to ascertain its terms%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Indeed%%lst%% Optus did ]n[ request a copy from Seven until 28 August 2001%%lst%% after Mr Wood had sent the letter of 13 August 2001 which%%lst%% in effect%%lst%% repeated the representations contained in the earlier letter%%per%% 
3103 As Mr Wise ]^[ Mr Wood must have known ]^[ as will become clear%%lst%% the strategy of pushing ]f[ 28 February 2002 as the earliest date on which Optus could exercise its right to terminate the C7%%dsh%%Optus CSA was doomed to failure %%cmp_if%% Optus had%%lst%% ]v[ gained access to%%lst%% a copy of the AFL%%dsh%%Seven Licence%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Both Mr Wood ]^[ Mr Wise knew that Optus had ]n[ requested a copy from Seven ]^[ that it was hardly likely that the AFL would provide a copy to Optus directly%%per%%]$~ 
~$[When Optus belatedly sought a copy from Seven%%lst%% its response was simply to ignore the request%%per%%]$~ 
~$[There was no expression of surprise from Seven that Optus had ]n[ already sought ]v[ obtained a copy of the AFL%%dsh%%Seven Licence%%per%%]$~ 
~$[I infer (and it does ]n[ seem to be disputed) that at the time Mr Wood sent the letters both he ]^[ Mr Wise must have realised that Optus did ]n[ have a copy of the AFL%%dsh%%Seven Licence%%per%% 
3104 Seven%%sqt%%s submissions acknowledge that it is important to take into account the fact that Seven%%sqt%%s conduct was directed at Optus specifically%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It accepts that an assessment of the character of its conduct will be influenced by what Mr Wood knew of Optus%%sqt%% position ]^[ the nature of the dealings that had taken place between Seven ]^[ Optus%%cln%% Butcher v Lachlan Elder Realty Pty Ltd [2004] HCA 60 %%scn%% (2004) 218 CLR 592%%lst%% at 604%%dsh%%605 [36]%%dsh%%[37]%%lst%% per Gleeson CJ%%lst%% Hayne ]^[ Heydon JJ%%per%%]$~ 
~$[However%%lst%% Seven submits that the factors that should be taken into account include Optus%%sqt%% commercial sophistication%%scn%% its knowledge that the representations concerned contracts which raise questions of interpretation on which reasonable minds might differ%%scn%% ]^[ its appreciation that Seven had an interest in pressing ]f[ a later termination date%%lst%% while Optus itself preferred an earlier date%%per%%]$~ 
~$[I agree that these are matters to take into account in determining what representations were conveyed by Mr Wood%%sqt%%s letters%%per%%]$~ 
~$[But they do ]n[ necessarily negate the case Optus seeks to make%%per%% 
3105 It is important to bear in mind that without a copy of the AFL%%dsh%%Seven Licence%%lst%% Optus lacked the critical document it needed to make an informed judgment about the timing of its right to terminate the C7%%dsh%%Optus CSA%%per%%]$~ 
~$[As I have explained%%lst%% Mr Wood ]^[ Mr Wise were aware of the disadvantage under which Optus laboured throughout 2001%%per%% 
3106 Above all%%lst%% however%%lst%% it is necessary to pay careful attention to what Mr Wood said%%lst%% particularly in his letter of 1 May 2001%%per%%]$~ 
~$[He asserted that under Seven%%sqt%%s %%sqt%% present arrangements with the AFL %%sqt%% it had the right to broadcast %%sqt%% the AFL Spectacles %%sqt%% until at least the commencement of the 2002 season in about February 2002%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It was on the basis of this assertion that Mr Wood was able to say that Optus%%sqt%% right of termination under cl 16%%per%%2(a) of the C7%%dsh%%Optus CSA would arise only on the first day of the 2002 season%%per%% 
3107 The letter explicitly (and correctly) linked the timing of the exercise of Optus%%sqt%% right to terminate the C7%%dsh%%Optus CSA under cl 16%%per%%2(a) to the terms of the AFL%%dsh%%Seven Licence%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Wood%%sqt%%s letter used language derived from the agreements with Seven%%lst%% the terms of which were known to him ]b[ (as he appreciated) were ]n[ known to Optus%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The very foundation ]f[ Mr Wood%%sqt%%s statement that Optus%%sqt%% right to terminate arose only on the first day of the 2002 season was his assertion that Seven%%lst%% under the AFL%%dsh%%Seven Licence%%lst%% had the right to broadcast AFL games on pay television until at least the commencement of the 2002 AFL season%%per%% 
3109 Mr Wood%%sqt%%s letter of 13 August 2001 to Mr Ebeid reiterated the assertion that the C7%%dsh%%Optus CSA could ]n[ be terminated by Optus until the beginning of the 2002 season%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In my opinion%%lst%% when read with the letter of 1 May 2001%%lst%% it conveyed the same representations%%per%% 
3110 Paragraph 19(e) of Optus%%sqt%% Cross%%dsh%%Claim pleads a representation by Seven that the wording of the AFL%%dsh%%Seven Licence supported Mr Wood%%sqt%%s assertion as to when Optus could exercise its right to terminate the C7%%dsh%%Optus CSA%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The first of the two representations I have found were made by Seven does ]n[ precisely correspond to the language used in par 19(e) of the Cross%%dsh%%Claim%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It is%%lst%% however%%lst%% to the same effect ]^[ I think is embraced by the pleading%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Certainly there is no injustice to Seven in reading the pleading this way%%per%% 
3111 Similarly%%lst%% it seems to me that the second of the representations I have found were made by Seven is in substance covered by par 19(f) of the Cross%%dsh%%Claim%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It is ]n[ clear what%%lst%% %%cmp_if%% anything%%lst%% the words %%sqt%% ]^[ reflected their views without qualification %%sqt%% add to the pleading%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Again%%lst%% there is no injustice to Seven in reading the Cross%%dsh%%Claim as embracing the second representation%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Seven%%sqt%%s submissions proceed on the basis that it must meet a case that Mr Wood ]^[ others within Seven did ]n[ believe that there was a reasonable basis ]f[ the statement that Optus%%sqt%% right to terminate the C7%%dsh%%Optus CSA arose only at the start of the 2002 AFL season%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Seven %%cmp_tf%% attempts to meet the case that arises on the findings I have made%%per%% 
20%%per%%2%%per%%5 Representation with Respect to a Future Matter? 
3112 The fact that a statement carries a representation as to the maker%%sqt%%s state of mind does ]n[ mean that the representation cannot also be %%sqt%% with respect to any future matter %%sqt%% within the meaning of s 51A(1) of the TP Act %%cln%% Ting v Blanche (1993) 118 ALR 543%%lst%% at 552%%dsh%%553%%lst%% per Hill J%%scn%% Sykes v Reserve Bank of Australia (1998) 88 FCR 511%%lst%% at 514%%dsh%%516%%lst%% per Heerey J%%scn%% at 520%%lst%% per Sundberg J%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Thus the fact that Mr Wood%%sqt%%s letter of 1 May 2001 conveyed a representation as to his ]^[ C7%%sqt%%s state of mind does ]n[ necessarily mean that it did ]n[ also convey a representation with respect to a future matter%%per%% 
3113 However%%lst%% it is still necessary to determine whether the representation can be said to be %%sqt%% with respect to any future matter %%sqt%% ]f[ the purposes of s 51A(1) of the TP Act %%per%%]$~ 
~$[That expression is ]n[ defined in the TP Act ]^[ applying it to the circumstances of a particular case can involve a difficult process of characterisation%%per%%]$~ 
~$[This is illustrated by the difference in opinion between members of the Full Federal Court in Sykes v Reserve Bank %%per%%]$~ 
~$[The majority in that case considered that the Reserve Bank had made a representation with respect to a future matter%%lst%% namely the release date of a new $5 note%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Emmett J%%lst%% in dissent%%lst%% took the view that the Bank had merely expressed its expectation as to the timing of the release ]^[ was ]n[ making a prediction%%per%%]$~ 
~$[For that reason%%lst%% ]s[ his Honour held%%lst%% the Bank could ]n[ be said to have made a representation as to a future matter%%per%% 
3114 There is no doubt that Mr Wood%%sqt%%s letter of 1 May 2001%%lst%% in one sense%%lst%% referred to something that was to happen in the future%%lst%% namely the date on which Optus would become entitled to exercise its right to terminate the C7%%dsh%%Optus CSA by reason of Seven%%sqt%%s loss of the AFL rights%%per%%]$~ 
~$[But the statement in the letter about that date was an inevitable consequence of the assertions made by Mr Wood as to the factual ]^[ legal position at the date of the letter%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The letter gave a particular operation to cl 16%%per%%2(a) of the C7%%dsh%%Optus CSA which was based on the effect of the AFL%%dsh%%Seven Licence%%per%%]$~ 
~$[That in turn depended on an agreement already in existence ]^[ on events that had already occurred (that is%%lst%% the award of the AFL pay television rights ]f[ 2002 ]^[ beyond to a party other %%cmp_ta%% Seven)%%per%%]$~ 
~$[If what Mr Wood said about the effect of the AFL%%dsh%%Seven Licence was correct%%lst%% the consequences ]f[ the exercise of Optus%%sqt%% right to terminate could be stated with certainty at the date of the letter%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In other words%%lst%% as Seven submits%%lst%% the letter contained no element of prediction%%lst%% forecast ]v[ projection%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Whether the statements in Mr Wood%%sqt%%s letter were right ]v[ wrong could have been ascertained on the date the letter was written%%per%% 
3115 For these reasons%%lst%% in my view%%lst%% Mr Wood%%sqt%%s letter of 1 May 2001 cannot be said to have made a representation with respect to a future matter%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The same is true of his letter of 13 August 2001%%per%%]$~ 
~$[There is %%cmp_tf%% no occasion to consider the application of s 51A of the TP Act to the representations contained in the letters%%per%% 
20%%per%%2%%per%%6 Were the Representations Misleading ]v[ Deceptive? 
20%%per%%2%%per%%6%%per%%1 FIRST REPRESENTATION 
3116 Seven%%sqt%%s submissions anticipate a finding to the effect that it had represented that there was a reasonable basis ]f[ the statements made in Mr Wood%%sqt%%s letters about the parties%%sqt%% contractual rights%%lst%% specifically the date Optus%%sqt%% right to terminate could be exercised%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Seven contends that ]n[ only was there a reasonable basis ]f[ the statements%%lst%% ]b[ that they were correct%%per%%]$~ 
~$[According to Seven%%lst%% on its true construction%%lst%% cl 16%%per%%2(a) of the C7%%dsh%%Optus CSA conferred a right of termination on Optus that could ]n[ be exercised until the commencement of the 2002 season%%per%% 
3117 This is a bold claim%%per%%]$~ 
~$[I suspect that its forensic purpose is ]n[ to demonstrate that the suggested construction of cl 16%%per%%2(a) is correct ]v[ even likely to be correct%%lst%% ]b[ to pass muster as a barely arguable proposition%%per%%]$~ 
~$[If it is arguable%%lst%% the first of the two representations made by Seven was ]n[ misleading ]v[ deceptive%%per%%]$~ 
~$[And %%cmp_if%% Seven%%sqt%%s construction argument is reasonably arguable%%lst%% it would make it more likely that Seven%%sqt%%s executives believed at the time the letters were sent that the argument was indeed plausible ]^[ thus that the second representation was ]n[ misleading ]v[ deceptive%%per%% 
3118 Seven%%sqt%%s construction argument is ]n[ easy to follow%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Seven points out%%lst%% correctly%%lst%% that the expression %%sqt%% pay television rights to AFL games %%sqt%% in cl 16%%per%%2(a) of the C7%%dsh%%Optus CSA is ]n[ a defined expression%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Seven submits that the expression must encompass those rights necessary to enable C7 to comply with its obligation%%lst%% imposed by cl 4%%per%%4 of the C7%%dsh%%Optus CSA%%lst%% to include certain content on the C7 channels%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Seven %%cmp_t%% says that the effect of the AFL%%dsh%%Seven Licence ]^[ the AFL Copyright Agreement (the terms of which have been summarised at [826]%%dsh%%[832]) was that Seven had the right to broadcast AFL games from the 1993%%dsh%%2001 seasons in perpetuity (albeit on a non%%dsh%%exclusive basis after the expiry of the AFL%%dsh%%Seven Licence)%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Finally%%lst%% Seven says that it follows that C7 had the rights necessary ]f[ it to comply with the requirements of cl 4%%per%%4 of the C7%%dsh%%Optus CSA until the start of the 2002 Ansett Cup (the pre%%dsh%%season competition)%%lst%% at which point C7 had to broadcast replays of that competition (cl 4%%per%%4(b)(i))%%per%%]$~ 
~$[However%%lst%% Seven does ]n[ explain why the conclusion follows%%per%% 
3119 There is no evidence that anyone within Seven put forward%%lst%% ]v[ even thought of%%lst%% this argument in the course of discussions about Optus%%sqt%% right of termination under the C7%%dsh%%Optus CSA%%per%%]$~ 
~$[This is ]n[ perhaps surprising %%cmp_b%% it seems to me that the argument%%lst%% insofar as it can be understood%%lst%% lacks a plausible foundation%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The fact that C7 had a non%%dsh%%exclusive right in perpetuity to broadcast games played during the period 1993%%dsh%%2001 hardly assists in determining precisely when Seven can be said no longer to have%%lst%% ]v[ to have lost%%lst%% the pay television rights to AFL games%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Similarly%%lst%% it is ]n[ easy to see why the terms of cl 4%%per%%4 of the C7%%dsh%%Optus CSA lead to ]v[ support the conclusion that Seven had the AFL pay television rights until the start of the Ansett Cup competition in 2002%%per%% 
3120 The C7%%dsh%%Optus CSA provided ]f[ the supply to Optus%%lst%% on a non%%dsh%%exclusive basis%%lst%% of the %%sqt%% Seven Service %%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The minimum AFL content of the Seven Service was determined by cl 4%%per%%4%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The critical obligations imposed on C7 were to supply a minimum number of exclusively live AFL games (cl 4%%per%%4(d)(i)) ]^[ a higher minimum combined number of exclusively live%%lst%% non%%dsh%%exclusive live ]^[ delayed broadcasts of AFL games%%per%% 
(The expression %%sqt%% delayed broadcast %%sqt%% was ]n[ defined%%per%%]$~ 
~$[However%%lst%% the C7%%dsh%%Optus CSA distinguished that expression from %%sqt%% replayed AFL games %%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[This suggests that a delayed broadcast is one that commences after the match itself ]b[ before the conclusion of the live match ]v[ at least within a very short time thereafter%%per%% 
) Clause 4%%per%%4 used the expression %%sqt%% in each AFL season %%sqt%%%%lst%% ]v[ very similar expressions%%lst%% on four separate occasions to specify the minimum obligations of C7 with respect to the broadcasting of AFL games on the C7 channels%%per%% 
3121 Clause 16%%per%%2(b) of the C7%%dsh%%Optus CSA expressly recognised that Seven%%sqt%%s AFL pay television rights had been granted by a separate agreement with the AFL%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Clause 16%%per%%2 implicitly recognised that whether Seven %%sqt%% does ]n[ have%%lst%% ]v[ loses %%sqt%% the rights would be determined by the terms of that agreement %%dsh%%%%dsh%%%%dsh%% that is%%lst%% the AFL%%dsh%%Seven Licence%%per%%]$~ 
~$[No one reading cl 16%%per%%2 of the C7%%dsh%%Optus CSA on its own could be sure whether the time at which Seven no longer had the AFL pay television rights would coincide with the end of an AFL season%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Whether that would ]v[ would ]n[ be the case would depend on the terms of the AFL%%dsh%%Seven Licence%%per%% 
3122 The AFL%%dsh%%Seven Licence expressly granted Seven the exclusive right to %%sqt%% broadcast live ]^[ delayed coverage [of AFL matches] by way of pay television %%sqt%% ]f[ specified %%sqt%% AFL Seasons %%sqt%%%%lst%% the last of which was the 2001 AFL Season (cl 3(a))%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The definition of %%sqt%% AFL Season %%sqt%% made it clear that the %%sqt%% AFL Seaso n%%sqt%% ended with the last finals match%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The rights fees were specified %%sqt%% insofar as they relate to ]^[ confer rights in respect %%sqt%% of each AFL Season%%per%% 
3123 It seems to me to make perfectly good sense as a matter of ordinary language to speak of Seven no longer having the AFL pay television rights after the end of the 2001 AFL season%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Its rights were granted in respect of matches played in that season%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Once the season ended%%lst%% there were simply no further matches in respect of which Seven had pay television rights%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Clause 16%%per%%2(a) of the C7%%dsh%%Optus CSA was plainly intended to confer on Optus a right to terminate which could be exercised as soon as the 2001 AFL season ended%%per%%]$~ 
~$[That was the point at which C7%%sqt%%s existing rights expired (cl 16%%per%%2(b)) ]^[ beyond which it would no longer have the rights to broadcast any new AFL matches on its pay television channels%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In essence%%lst%% the only rights C7 had thereafter were to replay old matches ]^[ those rights continued in perpetuity%%per%% 
3124 Sometimes agreements mean more ]v[ less what they say%%per%%]$~ 
~$[I do ]n[ think it was ever reasonably arguable that on the proper construction of cl 16%%per%%2(a)%%lst%% when read with the AFL%%dsh%%Optus Licence%%lst%% Seven had the AFL pay television rights beyond the end of the 2001 AFL season%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In any event%%lst%% it was ]n[ reasonably arguable that Seven had the rights until the start of the 2002 AFL season%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Thus in my opinion the first representation made by Seven to Optus in Mr Wood%%sqt%%s letters constituted misleading ]v[ deceptive conduct ]f[ the purposes of s 52 of the TP Act %%per%% 
20%%per%%2%%per%%6%%per%%2 SECOND REPRESENTATION 
3125 So far as the second representation (relating to the state of mind of Mr Wood ]^[ the senior management of Seven) is concerned%%lst%% there is no evidence that Seven obtained legal advice to the effect that there was a plausible argument supporting the contention that Optus%%sqt%% right to terminate the C7%%dsh%%Optus CSA did ]n[ arise until February 2002%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The absence of such advice does ]n[ necessarily mean%%lst%% however%%lst%% that the senior executives of Seven did ]n[ believe%%lst%% on the basis of their own reading of the contracts ]v[ other material%%lst%% that there was such an argument%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The issue was explored in evidence with three witnesses%%cln%% Mr Wood%%lst%% the signatory to the letters%%scn%% Mr Wise%%lst%% to whom Mr Wood reported%%scn%% ]^[ Mr Stokes%%per%% 
3126 In one of his written statements%%lst%% Mr Wood stated that C7 held the right to broadcast AFL matches %%sqt%% until the end of the 2001 AFL season %%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In his cross%%dsh%%examination%%lst%% Mr Wood confirmed that this statement reflected his state of mind throughout 2000 ]^[ 2001%%per%%]$~ 
~$[At no stage in his evidence did Mr Wood suggest that the negotiating position he put to Optus concerning its right to terminate the C7%%dsh%%Optus CSA reflected his belief that the position was correct ]v[ arguably correct%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Wood gave cogent reasons why it was advantageous ]f[ C7 to put to Optus that it could ]n[ terminate the C7%%dsh%%Optus CSA until February 2002%%per%%]$~ 
~$[But he did ]n[ say that he believed that the contention he was advancing was arguable%%lst%% whether on the basis of the contractual documentation with which he was familiar ]v[ on some other basis%%per%% 
3127 The assertions made in Mr Wood%%sqt%%s letters of 1 May ]^[ 13 August 2001 concerning the date Optus%%sqt%% right of termination could be exercised did ]n[ reflect his personal views%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Wood believed that C7%%sqt%%s rights continued only until the end of the 2001 season and%%lst%% ]s[ I infer%%lst%% that Optus%%sqt%% right of termination arose at that time%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Wood did ]n[ believe that there was an arguable case that Optus%%sqt%% right of termination did ]n[ arise until February 2002%%per%% 
3128 This does ]n[ necessarily mean that Mr Wood was dishonest in his dealings with Optus%%per%%]$~ 
~$[He may have been told by Mr Wise what negotiating strategy to adopt and%%lst%% %%cmp_if%% so%%lst%% he may have thought that this circumstance warranted putting the position he did concerning the termination date%%lst%% regardless of his personal views%%per%%]$~ 
~$[This possibility%%lst%% however%%lst%% does ]n[ detract from the finding I have made as to his state of mind%%per%% 
3129 Mr Wise knew that Mr Wood was representing to Optus that Optus could ]n[ terminate the C7%%dsh%%Optus CSA until February 2002 ]^[ indeed authorised Mr Wood to do so%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Wise accepted that the representation was important %%cmp_b%% it improved Seven%%sqt%%s bargaining position in relation to any arrangement with Optus extending ]v[ continuing the operation of the C7%%dsh%%Optus CSA%%per%%]$~ 
~$[But Mr Wise in his evidence maintained that the termination date was a %%sqt%% grey %%sqt%% area%%lst%% which was ]n[ defined in the contract%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It was %%cmp_tf%% in order ]f[ Seven to assert to Optus that it could ]n[ terminate the C7%%dsh%%Optus CSA until February 2002%%per%% 
3130 Mr Wise was confronted with the minutes of a meeting of the board of i7 held on 25 July 2001%%lst%% which recorded a statement by him that the C7%%dsh%%Optus CSA %%sqt%% lapse[d] at the end of the 2001 AFL Season %%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[After initially acknowledging that the minutes accurately recorded what he had said%%lst%% Mr Wise sought to withdraw the concession%%per%%]$~ 
~$[He fell back on the familiar claims by some of Seven%%sqt%%s witnesses that the minutes were inaccurate ]^[ did ]n[ record what he conveyed at the meeting%%per%% 
3131 I have explained my reservations about the reliability of aspects of Mr Wise%%sqt%%s evidence%%per%%]$~ 
~$[I do ]n[ accept that the minutes of the i7 board meeting were inaccurate%%per%%]$~ 
~$[I find that Mr Wise expressed the view recorded there%%per%%]$~ 
~$[That was in fact his view when Mr Wood made the representations to Optus%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Wise did ]n[ believe that there was a plausible argument ]f[ %%sqt%% push[ing] out %%sqt%% the termination date under the C7%%dsh%%Optus CSA until February 2002%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Rather he sought a negotiating advantage ]f[ Seven%%lst%% knowing that Optus did ]n[ have access to the contractual documentation that would enable it to check Seven%%sqt%%s assertions on that issue%%per%% 
3132 Two other matters support this finding%%per%%]$~ 
~$[First%%lst%% in an email sent by Mr Wise to Mr Stokes ]^[ others on 20 May 2001%%lst%% Mr Wise said that C7%%sqt%%s product %%sqt%% fundamentally changes at the end of September %%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Bannon did ]n[ ask Mr Wise about this email%%lst%% ]b[ Mr Meagher did%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Wise agreed that the comment was a reference%%lst%% in part%%lst%% to the fact that C7%%lst%% without AFL content%%lst%% would lose a subscription driving product at the end of September 2001%%per%%]$~ 
~$[While Mr Wise was ]n[ addressing specifically the question of a termination date%%lst%% the view expressed by him just three weeks after Mr Wood%%sqt%%s letter of 1 May 2001 was consistent with the view expressed by him at the meeting of 25 July 2001%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Secondly%%lst%% as Mr Wise admitted%%lst%% he had participated in misleading the AFL in November 2000%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Misleading Optus was ]n[ entirely foreign to his method of operation when negotiating ]f[ a favourable outcome ]f[ Seven%%per%% 
3133 Mr Stokes knew that the representations concerning the termination date were being made to Optus in the context of negotiations concerning the First ]^[ Second Variation Agreements%%per%%]$~ 
~$[He accepted that the representations did ]n[ reflect his view%%lst%% which (he said) was that the right of termination arose at the end of 2001%%per%%]$~

3148 The representation that Optus could ]n[ terminate the C7%%dsh%%Optus CSA until the commencement of the 2002 season was a key element in Seven%%sqt%%s negotiating strategy that led to the First Variation Agreement%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Wood agreed that the representation improved Seven%%sqt%%s bargaining position%%lst%% since Seven was able to argue that it could simply rely on the terms of the C7%%dsh%%Optus CSA ]^[ had no particular need to enter into an interim agreement%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Wood also agreed that %%cmp_if%% Seven had acknowledged in December 2001 that the C7%%dsh%%Optus CSA was terminable at the end of December%%lst%% Seven would have been placed in a weaker negotiating position in relation to the Second Variation Agreement%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The representation that Optus could ]n[ exercise its right of termination until 28 February 2002 was integrally related to the two representations I have found were made by Seven in Mr Wood%%sqt%%s letters%%per%%

~$[It was the key%%lst%% as far as he was concerned%%lst%% to extending the operation of the C7%%dsh%%Optus CSA at least until the end of February 2002%%per%% 
3150 Optus%%sqt%% initial legal advice was that its right to terminate the C7%%dsh%%Optus CSA could be exercised at the end of the 2001 season%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Keely%%sqt%%s evidence (which I accept) was that Mr Wood%%sqt%%s letter of 1 May 2001%%lst%% insofar as it asserted a termination date of February 2002%%lst%% had ]n[ been anticipated by Optus%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The advice by Optus%%sqt%% solicitors%%lst%% which was expressly based on the assumption that Seven%%sqt%%s rights under the AFL%%dsh%%Seven Licence were as Mr Wood had suggested%%lst%% was that Mr Wood%%sqt%%s position looked to be credible%%lst%% ]b[ would depend upon verification by reference to the terms of the AFL%%dsh%%Seven Licence%%per%%]$~

~$[Optus in fact acted on this basis%%lst%% notwithstanding Mr Ebeid%%sqt%%s unsuccessful attempt to convince Mr Wood that Optus had legal advice that the termination date was the end of the 2001 season%%per%%]$~ 
~$[No doubt Mr Ebeid%%sqt%%s attempt was unsuccessful %%cmp_b%% Mr Wood realised that it was unlikely that Optus had received any such advice%%per%%

~$[Mr Ebeid%%sqt%%s recommendation may ]n[ have turned out to be important%%lst%% given the intervention of the SingTel Optus Executive Group in September 2001%%per%%]$~

20%%per%%2%%per%%7%%per%%4 COUNTER%%dsh%%FACTUAL WORLD 
3154 The parties are in apparent agreement that the question of loss ]v[ damage ]v[ likely loss ]v[ damage is to be determined by reference to what Optus would have done had Seven ]n[ engaged in the misleading conduct which (as I have found) induced Optus to enter the First ]^[ Second Variation Agreements on the terms it did%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In the terminology employed by the parties%%lst%% this involves consideration of the %%sqt%% counter%%dsh%%factual world %%sqt%%%%per%% 
3155 The parties%%sqt%% apparent agreement as to the relevant question does ]n[ extend to the answer to that question%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Seven submits that%%lst%% in the absence of any misleading conduct by C7%%lst%% Optus%%sqt%% position would ]n[ have been materially different%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Optus would have entered into a short term content supply arrangement with C7%%lst%% including the Exclusivity Clause%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Optus%%lst%% by contrast%%lst%% submits that%%lst%% in the absence of the misleading conduct%%lst%% it would have agreed on some form of interim arrangement ]b[ without an Exclusivity Clause%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Moreover%%lst%% Optus asserts%%lst%% without elaboration%%lst%% that any interim arrangement would have been on terms incorporating a reduced licence fee%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It is this assertion which underpins Optus%%sqt%% claim that it sustained loss ]v[ damage ]f[ the purposes of s 82 of the TP Act ]^[ that the loss ]v[ damage is equivalent to the top up payment made by it to Seven in March 2002%%per%% 
3156 Sometimes it is ]n[ at all difficult to ascertain what would have happened had one party ]n[ engaged in misleading ]v[ deceptive conduct%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In other cases the assessment of the %%sqt%% counter%%dsh%%factual %%sqt%% is less clear cut%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The present case involves some degree of uncertainty since%%lst%% in the absence of Seven%%sqt%%s misleading conduct%%lst%% the parties would have been negotiating on a different hypothesis as to the date on which Optus became entitled to exercise its rights to terminate the C7%%dsh%%Optus CSA%%per%%]$~ 
~$[There is %%cmp_tf%% necessarily an element of evaluation ]^[ judgment in making a finding as to the likely outcome of the hypothetical negotiations%%per%% 
3157 The starting point must be the position in early September 2001%%per%%]$~ 
~$[At that point%%lst%% Mr Wood ]^[ Mr Ebeid had reached what in substance was an agreement in principle ]f[ a three year deal ]f[ the supply of C7 channels to Optus Vision%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The agreement was ]n[ final %%cmp_b%% it was subject to approval by each corporation%%sqt%%s decision%%dsh%%makers%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Despite Mr Ebeid%%sqt%%s obvious enthusiasm ]f[ consummating the agreement%%lst%% Mr Anderson immediately warned that there was no chance of it being %%sqt%% wrapped up quickly %%sqt%% %%cmp_b%% the proposal would %%sqt%% run into the CMM review %%sqt%%%%per%% 
3158 It was the CMM review that created a new reality within which negotiations had to take place (and would have had to take place in the counter%%dsh%%factual world)%%per%%]$~ 
~$[On 17 September 2001%%lst%% the SingTel Optus Executive Group resolved to see whether it was possible to %%sqt%% roll %%sqt%% the C7%%dsh%%Optus CSA ]f[ a further three months %%sqt%% ]^[ to seek to maintain our options on a more favourable future contract until after that time %%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[These were Mr Ebeid%%sqt%%s instructions ]f[ his negotiations with Mr Wood from that point%%per%% 
3159 If there had been no misleading conduct by Seven%%lst%% Optus would ]n[ have been labouring under the belief that the earliest termination date available to it was probably 28 February 2002%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Any statement by Seven to that effect would have lacked credibility in the absence of the misleading representations that were made by Mr Wood%%per%% 
3161 In reaching these conclusions%%lst%% I have borne in mind that in September 2001 Mr Ebeid was reluctant to commit Optus to an Exclusivity Clause drafted in broad terms%%per%%]$~ 
~$[There were sound reasons ]f[ Optus to preserve the opportunity at least to discuss ]v[ negotiate possible arrangements with an alternative content supplier%%lst%% even though the chances of Fox Sports becoming available were thought to be slim%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Not the least of these was the existence of Project Alchemy (whereby Optus would effectively become a reseller of Foxtel content) as a live option within Optus%%per%% 
3162 The negotiating tactic that Mr Wood employed to good effect was to assert to Optus that %%cmp_if%% it did ]n[ agree to what became the First Variation Agreement%%lst%% including the Exclusivity Clause drafted by C7%%lst%% the C7%%dsh%%Optus CSA would simply continue in force until the end of February 2002%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In that case%%lst%% Optus would have had to incur the higher level of fees ]f[ the succeeding four months%%lst%% a commitment that was ]n[ provided ]f[ in Optus%%sqt%% budget%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The tactic was effective largely %%cmp_b%% Optus was operating under the misapprehension%%lst%% induced in part by C7%%sqt%%s misleading conduct%%lst%% that it could ]n[ safely terminate the C7%%dsh%%Optus CSA until February 2002%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Optus was %%cmp_tf%% to some extent in the position of a contractual supplicant seeking a concession from C7%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Ebeid yielded on the Exclusivity Clause %%cmp_b%% he saw that there was little choice%%per%% 
3163 No doubt in the counter%%dsh%%factual world Mr Wood would have argued ]f[ the broader version of the Exclusivity Clause%%lst%% essentially ]f[ the reasons he gave in his exchange with Mr Ebeid%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It is true that C7 would ]n[ have been totally bereft of bargaining power%%lst%% since Optus needed to maintain continuity of sporting content in order to preserve Optus%%sqt%% options%%per%%]$~ 
~$[But C7 was also vulnerable ]^[ needed an agreement%%per%%]$~ 
~$[As Mr Stokes accepted in cross%%dsh%%examination%%lst%% an ongoing sports deal with Optus was essential to C7%%sqt%%s business after its loss of the AFL pay television rights%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Absent its misleading conduct%%lst%% C7 would have lacked the key negotiating advantage it exploited ]s[ effectively in late September 2001%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In my view%%lst%% that would have made the difference ]s[ far as the form of the Exclusivity Clause is concerned%%per%% 
3164 In the counter%%dsh%%factual world%%lst%% the parties would have had to negotiate the precise financial ]^[ content supply terms of the interim arrangement%%per%%]$~ 
~$[There is a possibility that%%lst%% as Optus submits%%lst%% it would ]n[ have agreed to make a %%sqt%% top up %%sqt%% payment %%cmp_if%% it did ]n[ ultimately enter into a three year deal with C7%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Alternatively%%lst%% it is possible that Optus would have insisted on a reduced payment rather %%cmp_ta%% a complete top up%%per%%]$~ 
~$[But given the parties%%sqt%% respective objectives ]^[ Optus%%sqt%% need to secure continuity of sporting content (whether ]v[ ]n[ at precisely the same levels provided ]f[ in the First ]^[ Second Variation Agreements)%%lst%% I am ]n[ satisfied that the outcome on the top up payment would have been as Optus suggests%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In my opinion%%lst%% Optus%%sqt%% submissions do ]n[ identify any convincing reason why the negotiations would have produced the outcome ]f[ which it contends%%per%% 
3165 In the counter%%dsh%%factual world%%lst%% the likelihood is that the parties would have renegotiated a further short extension of the First Variation Agreement after its expiry%%lst%% on much the same terms%%per%%]$~ 
~$[This would have happened in about December 2001%%lst%% at about the time Mr Stokes ]^[ Mr Anderson in fact agreed to the extension%%per%%]$~ 
~$[A further short extension would have suited the interests of both C7 ]^[ Optus Vision at that time%%per%% 
3166 On the findings I have made%%lst%% Optus would ]n[ have contravened any Exclusivity Clause incorporated in Variation Agreements%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Any discussions ]v[ negotiations with Foxtel%%lst%% Fox Sports ]v[ another party would ]n[ have contravened a more narrowly drafted provision%%per%%]$~ 
~$[While entry into an agreement such as the Foxtel%%dsh%%Optus Term Sheet (which in fact was executed on 20 February 2002) would have contravened a narrower Exclusivity Clause%%lst%% there would have been no reason ]f[ Optus to enter into any such formal arrangement until the expiry of any interim arrangement with C7%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Optus%%sqt%% entry into the Foxtel%%dsh%%Optus Term Sheet a few days before the Second Variation Agreement expired was preceded by legal advice that recognised that Optus was already in breach of the Exclusivity Clause in the C7%%dsh%%Optus CSA%%per%%]$~ 
~$[That would ]n[ have been Optus%%sqt%% position had a more restrictive Exclusivity Clause been in place%%per%%]$~ 
~$[There is no reason to think that Optus would have breached such an Exclusivity Clause by prematurely entering an agreement when there was no commercial imperative to do so%%per%% 
3167 I add two comments%%per%%]$~ 
~$[First%%lst%% the form of any interim arrangement made between C7 ]^[ Optus in the counter%%dsh%%factual world may have been different from the form taken by the First ]^[ Second Variation Agreements%%per%%]$~ 
~$[These agreements amended the C7%%dsh%%Optus CSA%%lst%% which continued in force subject to the amendments%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Optus is likely to have terminated the C7%%dsh%%Optus CSA in late September 2001%%lst%% when it became entitled to do so%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Whether the interim arrangements following the termination would have taken the form of amendments to a revived C7%%dsh%%Optus CSA ]v[ would have been incorporated in an entirely fresh agreement is ]n[ a matter of substance%%per%% 
3168 Secondly%%lst%% in making findings I have paid close attention to the events that actually occurred%%lst%% especially between September 2001 ]^[ February 2002%%per%%]$~ 
~$[I have borne in mind the evidence of witnesses as to what they might have done in the counter%%dsh%%factual world%%per%%]$~

20%%per%%3%%per%%2 Representation of 28 September 2001 
20%%per%%3%%per%%2%%per%%1 INTERPRETING SEVEN%%sqt%%S SUBMISSIONS 
3179 Seven%%sqt%%s Closing Submissions assume rather %%cmp_ta%% demonstrate that Optus%%sqt%% letter of 28 September 2001 from Mr Ebeid to Mr Wood constituted a representation that%%lst%% %%cmp_if%% Seven entered into the First Variation Agreement%%lst%% Optus would comply with the Exclusivity Clause%%per%%]$~ 
~$[On that assumption%%lst%% Seven submits that the representation was false %%cmp_b%% at all times Optus%%sqt%% senior officers intended to negotiate%%lst%% %%cmp_if%% possible%%lst%% an arrangement ]f[ the supply of the Fox Sports channels%%per%% 
3180 To that extent%%lst%% Seven%%sqt%%s submissions seem to develop a case pleaded in the Statement of Claim (par 638(a))%%per%%]$~ 
~$[However%%lst%% the submissions do ]n[ attempt to develop the pleaded case insofar as the Statement of Claim invokes s 51A of the TP Act (pars 632%%lst%% 637)%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The question presented by Seven%%sqt%%s submissions is whether%%lst%% assuming that its initial assumption is correct%%lst%% it has established that Optus%%sqt%% representation as to its future conduct was false when made %%cmp_b%% Optus never intended to comply with the Exclusivity Clause%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The question presented by the submissions (despite the pleadings) is ]n[ whether Optus had reasonable grounds ]f[ making a representation as to a future matter%%lst%% namely that it would ]n[ engage in discussion ]v[ negotiations of the kind identified in the Exclusivity Clause%%per%% 
3181 In a sense%%lst%% the way Seven has chosen to present its case attempts to resurrect the law as it was prior to the enactment of s 51A of the TP Act%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The general principle articulated in the authorities prior to the enactment of s 51A was that%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%a promise of future conduct was ]n[ actionable under s 52 unless it implied a representation as to an existing ]v[ past fact%%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Wright v TNT Management Pty Ltd (1989) 15 NSWLR 679%%lst%% at 688%%lst%% per McHugh JA (dissenting)%%lst%% citing Bill Acceptance Corporation Ltd v GWA Ltd (1983) 50 ALR 242%%lst%% at 246%%dsh%%247%%lst%% per Lockhart J%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Thus the mere fact that a representation as to future conduct did ]n[ come to pass did ]n[ establish that the representation was misleading ]v[ deceptive when made%%lst%% although it may have been evidence that the representor did ]n[ genuinely believe at the time of the representation that the future conduct would take place%%cln%% Bill Acceptance 50 ALR %%lst%% at 250%%lst%% per Lockhart J%%scn%% Global Sportsman Pty Ltd v Mirror Newspapers Pty Ltd (1984) 2 FCR 82%%lst%% at 88%%lst%% per curiam%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The significance of the fact that the representor did ]n[ genuinely believe that the future conduct would take place depended on the nature of the representation%%per%%]$~ 
~$[If the representor conveyed that he ]v[ she had a particular state of mind ]v[ belief%%lst%% the absence of such a state of mind ]v[ belief could constitute misleading ]v[ deceptive conduct%%cln%% Global Sportsman 2 FCR%%lst%% at 88 per curiam %%per%% 
3182 It is this situation to which s 51A of the TP Act is directed%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Section 51A(1) provides that where a corporation makes a representation with respect to any future matter (including the doing of%%lst%% ]v[ the refusing to do%%lst%% any act) ]^[ the corporation does ]n[ have reasonable grounds ]f[ making the representation%%lst%% the representation shall be taken to be misleading%%per%%]$~ 
~$[There is now a body of authority identifying when a promise amounts to a representation with respect to a future matter ]f[ the purposes of s 51A(1) of the TP Act%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In particular%%lst%% the cases have considered whether contractual promises%%lst%% ]v[ promises made in contractual negotiations%%lst%% can be characterised as representations with respect to a future matter%%cln%% Futuretronics International Pty Ltd v Gadzhis [1992] 2 VR 217%%lst%% at 235%%dsh%%241%%lst%% per Ormiston J%%scn%% Concrete Constructions Group Ltd v Litevale Pty Ltd [2002] NSWSC 670 %%scn%% (2002) 170 FLR 290 (S Ct NSW)%%lst%% at 343%%dsh%%349 [154]%%dsh%%[173]%%lst%% per Mason P%%scn%% Frontier Touring Co Pty Ltd v Rodgers (2005) 223 ALR 422 (S Ct NSW)%%lst%% at 442%%dsh%%443 [27]%%dsh%%[29]%%lst%% per Barrett J%%per%% 
3183 The High Court%%lst%% however%%lst%% has ]y[ to have the last word on this issue%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In HTW Valuers (Central Qld) Pty Ltd v Astonland Pty Ltd [2004] HCA 54 %%scn%% (2004) 217 CLR 640%%lst%% the Court observed (at 649 [13]) that%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%Before the enactment of s 51A in 1986%%lst%% there was %%per%%%%per%%%%per%% authority that a breach of promise relating to the future could ]n[ be a breach of s 52 unless a misrepresentation of existing fact was made%%lst%% ]f[ example%%lst%% that the promisor had the capacity ]v[ intention to perform the promise%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Since the enactment of s 51A%%lst%% there has been authority that a breach of promise may contravene s 52 in its operation with s 51A %%cmp_if%% there is an implied representation by the promisor of an intention ]v[ capacity to perform the promise%%lst%% ]^[ there are no reasonable grounds ]f[ making that representation%%per%%]$~ 
~$[However%%lst%% in some future cases of the present type%%lst%% where the breach of contract is found in the failure by a professional adviser who has made a representation about future matters (for example%%lst%% rental levels) to qualify it by a statement about their uncertainty%%lst%% it may be necessary to give close attention to the question how the breach of contract falls%%lst%% %%cmp_if%% at all%%lst%% within the language of s 51A(1) ]^[ (2)%%sqt%%%%per%% 
3184 The way in which Seven presents its argument is curious%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It submits that the letter of 28 September 2001 should be understood as conveying a representation%%lst%% in effect%%lst%% with respect to a future matter%%lst%% namely that Optus would ]n[ act inconsistently with the terms of the Exclusivity Clause%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The point of putting the case that way would seem to be to take advantage of s 51A of the TP Act in order to establish that the representation was misleading%%lst%% as indeed the pleadings suggest%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Yet%%lst%% as I have noted%%lst%% the written submissions do ]n[ rely on s 51A ]f[ this purpose ]^[ do ]n[ attempt to make out a case that Optus had no reasonable grounds ]f[ making the representation with respect to a future matter%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Instead they assert that Optus never intended to comply with the Exclusivity Clause%%per%%]$~ 
~$[This assertion seems to be designed to establish the falsity of a representation that Seven has ]n[ specifically alleged%%lst%% namely that the letter of 28 September conveyed a representation that Optus %%cmp_t%% had an intention ]n[ to act inconsistently with the terms of the Exclusivity Clause%%per%% 
3185 The lack of clarity%%lst%% %%cmp_if%% ]n[ confusion%%lst%% in Seven%%sqt%%s submissions creates a difficulty in how to approach them%%per%%]$~ 
~$[I do ]n[ think it appropriate to consider the possible application of s 51A of the TP Act when Seven%%lst%% in its submissions%%lst%% does ]n[ ask me to take that course ]^[ has ]n[ explained how%%lst%% in light of the facts%%lst%% s 51A is satisfied%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Because Seven has ]n[ invoked s 51A%%lst%% Optus has ]n[ had the opportunity to respond to whatever arguments Seven might have put forward on that issue%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In my view%%lst%% this case is large ]^[ complex enough without having to reconstruct Seven%%sqt%%s arguments ]s[ that they are internally consistent%%per%% 
3186 The most sensible approach%%lst%% it seems to me%%lst%% is to consider first whether Optus%%sqt%% letter of 28 September 2001 conveyed a representation that would be falsified %%cmp_if%% indeed Optus never intended to comply with the Exclusivity Clause%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The threshold question would %%cmp_t%% be whether Optus%%sqt%% letter represented that Optus had the intention%%lst%% as at 28 September 2001%%lst%% of acting consistently with the requirements of the Exclusivity Clause during the period 27 September 2001 to 31 December 2001%%per%%]$~

20%%per%%3%%per%%2%%per%%2 MAKING OF THE REPRESENTATION 
3187 The Exclusivity Clause was inserted in the First Variation Agreement at Mr Wood%%sqt%%s insistence%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The origins of the Exclusivity Clause lay in the negotiations between Mr Ebeid ]^[ Mr Wood%%per%%]$~ 
~$[By 19 September 2001%%lst%% an agreement %%sqt%% in principle %%sqt%% had been reached between them%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Ebeid reported on that date that the agreement in principle included a guarantee that Optus would ]n[ negotiate with any other sports provider during the three month period of the interim arrangement%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Ebeid acknowledged in evidence that he had told Mr Wood that Optus was ]n[ buying time simply to get a better deal ]f[ Fox Sports ]^[ that Optus did ]n[ intend to use the arrangement ]f[ that purpose%%per%% 
3188 Mr Ebeid%%sqt%%s %%sqt%% without prejudice %%sqt%% letter of 20 September 2001 included a term whereby Optus agreed ]n[ to enter into an agreement with any other sports channel provider%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In response%%lst%% Mr Wood drafted what became the Exclusivity Clause in broader terms %%cmp_ta%% Mr Ebeid had proposed%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The new draft clause prohibited Optus ]v[ its related companies ]n[ only from entering any agreement relating to the supply of sports channels%%lst%% ]b[ from initiating ]v[ participating in discussions ]v[ negotiations in relation to the supply of sports channels%%per%% 
3189 When Mr Ebeid protested on 27 September 2001 about the breadth of the Exclusivity Clause%%lst%% Mr Wood stuck to his position%%per%%]$~ 
~$[He justified his insistence on the broader version on the ground that Mr Ebeid had told him that Optus had ceased its negotiations with Fox Sports (which was in fact true)%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Wood also pointed out to Mr Ebeid that on the narrower wording Optus would be free to negotiate a deal with Fox Sports during the period of the interim arrangement ]^[ simply defer executing the formal documentation until 1 January 2002 (which was also true)%%per%% 
3190 In my view%%lst%% some care should be taken before construing a contractual undertaking ]v[ promise as importing a representation as to the state of mind of the person giving the undertaking ]v[ making the promise%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In Concrete Constructions 170 FLR%%lst%% at 349%%lst%% Mason P observed that there are policy reasons ]f[ restraint when a court is asked to infer the making of%%lst%% ]v[ reliance upon%%lst%% a representation as to capacity to perform express contractual promises%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Similar policy reasons suggest that restraint should be exercised when determining whether a contractual promise to do ]v[ refrain from doing something in the future carries with it a representation as to the existing state of mind ]v[ intention of the representor%%per%% 
3191 In the end%%lst%% however%%lst%% every case must turn on its facts%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In this case%%lst%% the critical point is that in the course of the negotiations that produced the Exclusivity Clause in its final form%%lst%% Mr Ebeid gave Mr Wood an assurance that Optus was no longer negotiating with Fox Sports%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Moreover%%lst%% Mr Wood put to Mr Ebeid C7%%sqt%%s concerns about the possibility of Optus negotiating ]v[ engaging in discussions during the three month period covered by the First Variation Agreement%%per%%]$~ 
~$[I infer that Mr Ebeid understood Mr Wood%%sqt%%s concerns ]^[ ultimately assented to allay them by agreeing to incorporate the Exclusivity Clause into the First Variation Agreement%%per%%]$~ 
~$[I have already explained why I think that Mr Ebeid assented%%per%%]$~ 
~$[For present purposes%%lst%% I am concerned with the course of dealings that in fact took place between Seven ]^[ Optus%%per%% 
3192 It is true that Seven does ]n[ rely on these circumstances%%lst%% of themselves%%lst%% as constituting a representation by Optus that it did ]n[ intend to engage in negotiations ]v[ discussions concerning the supply of sports channels during the period covered by the First Variation Agreement%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Nonetheless%%lst%% the significance ]f[ Seven%%sqt%%s s 52 case of Optus%%sqt%% acceptance of the Exclusivity Clause in the form drafted by Mr Wood must be assessed in the context of the dealings between Mr Wood ]^[ Mr Ebeid%%per%%]$~

3194 Mr Anderson was closely questioned by Mr Karkar QC on behalf of Seven about his state of mind when he signed the First Variation Agreement%%per%%]$~

~$[In answer to a later question%%lst%% Mr Anderson denied that on 28 September 2001 he %%sqt%% fully intended to continue to seek the acquisition of Fox Sports ]f[ Optus %%sqt%%%%per%% 
3195 I have considered Mr Anderson%%sqt%%s evidence in the context of the established facts%%per%%]$~ 
~$[These include Mr Anderson%%sqt%%s role as a signatory to the First Variation Agreement%%scn%% the dinner at Tetsuya%%sqt%%s on 9 October%%scn%% the subsequent emails to which Mr Anderson was a party%%scn%% ]^[ Mr Anderson%%sqt%%s conversation with Mr Rupert Murdoch on 11 October 2001%%per%%]$~ 
~$[I have also taken into account the references in emails sent by Mr Anderson in mid%%dsh%%2001 ]^[ at other times relating to sporting content%%per%%]$~ 
~$[I accept Mr Anderson%%sqt%%s evidence that as at 28 September 2001 he gave little thought to the Exclusivity Clause ]^[ had ]n[ formed a view at that time that Optus should continue to negotiate with Foxtel ]f[ the supply of the Fox Sports channels%%per%%]$~ 
~$[His evidence that there were many other substantial matters claiming his attention at the time ]^[ that he gave little attention %%cmp_t%% to the question of sports content on the Optus platform rang true%%per%%]$~ 
~$[I also accept his evidence that his relatively brief discussion with Mr Murdoch on 11 October 2001 did ]n[ descend to particularity in the provision of sports channels to Optus%%per%% 
3196 It may be that in September ]^[ October 2001%%lst%% Mr Anderson distinguished in his own mind between discussions relating to the restructuring of the pay television industry ]^[ discussions relating specifically to the supply of the Fox Sports channels to Optus%%per%%]$~ 
~$[His evidence can be read as suggesting that he made that distinction at some point%%lst%% at least in the period following the execution of the First Variation Agreement%%per%%]$~ 
~$[For that reason he may ]n[ have understood discussions on restructuring of the pay television industry to have been caught by the Exclusivity Clause%%per%%]$~ 
~$[But this point was ]n[ developed in cross%%dsh%%examination%%lst%% ]f[ example%%lst%% with a view to showing that Mr Anderson might perhaps have been reckless in failing to ascertain whether cl 8A%%lst%% as a matter of construction%%lst%% inhibited discussions about the broader question of restructuring of the pay television industry%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The thrust of the cross%%dsh%%examination was that Mr Anderson was ]n[ to be believed when he denied that on 28 September he had no intention of complying with the Exclusivity Clause%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In my view%%lst%% that attack on his credit did ]n[ succeed%%per%% 
3197 Seven invited me to draw inferences adverse to Optus from its failure to call Mr O%%sqt%%Sullivan (who participated in the meeting at Tetsuya%%sqt%%s)%%per%%]$~ 
~$[But as Optus pointed out%%lst%% Seven%%sqt%%s pleadings did ]n[ identify the meeting at Tetsuya%%sqt%%s as having any particular significance on this issue%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Indeed%%lst%% the cross%%dsh%%examination of Mr Anderson on his state of mind after the meeting at Tetsuya%%sqt%%s was initially said to be relevant %%cmp_b%% it went to Seven%%sqt%%s claim ]f[ aggravated damages%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It was apparently only as forensic afterthought that the questions were supported by reference to the claim that Optus always intended to negotiate with Foxtel%%per%% 
3198 In any event%%lst%% Mr O%%sqt%%Sullivan%%sqt%%s absence from the witness box does ]n[ provide a satisfactory basis ]f[ me to take a different view of Mr Anderson%%sqt%%s credibility%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In the light of Mr Anderson%%sqt%%s evidence ]^[ the other matters to which I have referred%%lst%% I am ]n[ prepared to infer from Mr O%%sqt%%Sullivan%%sqt%%s participation in the meeting at Tetsuya%%sqt%%s that he intended on 28 September 2001 that Optus should continue to negotiate with Foxtel ]f[ the supply of Fox Sports to Optus%%lst%% regardless of the terms of the Exclusivity Clause%%per%%]$~

~$[Mr Stokes%%lst%% somewhat implausibly%%lst%% adamantly refused to concede that the absence of any contemporaneous record of such a remark by Mr Anderson%%lst%% suggested that his (Mr Stokes%%sqt%%) recollection after some years might be wrong%%per%% 
3201 A further difficulty with Mr Stokes%%sqt%% account is that in one of his written statements he said that%%lst%% %%cmp_if%% he had known that Mr Anderson had met with Messrs Murdoch%%lst%% Packer ]^[ Chisholm in early December 2001 ]^[ that Mr Anderson had communicated with the Foxtel partners since mid%%dsh%%2001%%lst%% he would ]n[ have agreed to the Second Variation Agreement%%per%%]$~

~$[According to Optus%%lst%% the December 2001 discussions%%cln%%

~$[In addition%%lst%% Optus Vision was required to immediately cease any existing negotiations ]v[ discussions with%%lst%% ]^[ decline ]v[ terminate any offers made by%%lst%% any person other %%cmp_ta%% C7 in relation to the same matters%%per%% 
3224 Optus does ]n[ dispute that the discussions that took place on 3%%lst%% 6 ]^[ 10 December 2001%%lst%% in which Optus was involved%%lst%% centred around the achievement of a content sharing agreement%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Nor does it suggest that the exception in the Exclusivity Clause relating to AFL ]^[ NRL match broadcasts covers the discussions that occurred%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Its point appears to be that the interchanges (to use a neutral term) did ]n[ reach the level of %%sqt%% discussions ]v[ negotiations %%sqt%% within the meaning of the Exclusivity Clause%%per%% 
3225 The Exclusivity Clause was expressed in very broad terms%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It prohibited Optus Vision%%lst%% ]n[ merely from initiating discussions ]v[ negotiations in relation to the supply of any sports channel%%lst%% ]b[ from encouraging ]v[ participating in such discussions ]v[ negotiations%%per%%]$~

~$[An unsolicited telephone call to Mr Anderson from Foxtel%%lst%% ]f[ example%%lst%% raising the possibility of Foxtel supplying a sports channel to Optus would ]n[ involve a contravention %%cmp_if%% Mr Anderson merely listened to what was said ]^[ indicated that he could ]n[ take the matter further during the exclusivity period%%per%% 
3227 But what happened here went well beyond any threshold%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Anderson%%sqt%%s own reports on the conversations with Messrs Murdoch%%lst%% Packer ]^[ Chisholm on 3 December 2001 show that Mr Anderson engaged in discussions concerning the supply of the Foxtel Service%%lst%% which obviously included sports channels%%lst%% to Optus%%per%%]$~

~$[He put forward%%lst%% albeit in general terms%%lst%% the conditions upon which Optus would insist %%cmp_if%% it were to take the Foxtel Service as suggested by Messrs Murdoch ]^[ Packer%%per%%]$~

3228 Optus refers to handwritten notes prepared by Mr Fletcher of the meetings of 6 ]^[ 10 December 2001%%per%%]$~

~$[They also indicate that the content to be supplied was discussed%%per%%]$~ 
~$[While the notes apparently make no specific reference to sports channels%%lst%% the proposed %%sqt%% redistri[butions] deal %%sqt%% was obviously to include sporting channels%%per%% 
3231 It is true that the discussions in early December 2001%%lst%% as Mr Anderson said in his evidence%%lst%% took place in the context of a proposal ]f[ industry restructuring%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It would also seem to be true that%%lst%% as Mr Fletcher said%%lst%% the meeting of 10 December 2001 concluded with the Optus participants forming the view that %%sqt%% there were very substantial hurdles to be overcome %%sqt%%%%per%%]$~

~$[There is no basis%%lst%% either in the language of the Exclusivity Clause ]v[ the circumstances in which it came to be included in the C7%%dsh%%Optus CSA%%lst%% to read it ]s[ as to prohibit only discussions specifically limited to the supply of sports channels%%per%% 
3232 It follows that %%cmp_if%%%%lst%% contrary to my holding%%lst%% the Exclusivity Clause were valid ]^[ enforceable%%lst%% Optus breached it by engaging in the discussions of 3%%lst%% 6 ]^[ 10 December 2001%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Optus concedes (on the same assumption as to validity ]^[ enforceability) that it breached the Exclusivity Clause by entering the Foxtel%%dsh%%Optus Term Sheet on 20 February 2002%%per%%]$~

3238 Seven does ]n[ explain clearly why Optus%%sqt%% breach of the Exclusivity Clause%%lst%% even %%cmp_if%% it be assumed to be an essential term of the C7%%dsh%%Optus CSA%%lst%% should have prevented Optus exercising its apparently independent contractual right to terminate the C7%%dsh%%Optus CSA%%per%%]$~

20%%per%%6%%per%%1%%per%%1 OPTUS%%sqt%% SUBMISSIONS 
3258 Optus submits that Seven%%sqt%%s failure to supply the AFL%%dsh%%Seven Licence on request breached cl 21(a) of the C7%%dsh%%Optus CSA%%lst%% which required each party %%sqt%% to use reasonable efforts to do all things necessary ]v[ desirable to give full effect to this agreement %%sqt%%%%per%%]$~

3260 There is a threshold issue as to whether the expression %%sqt%% necessary ]v[ desirable to give full effect to this agreement %%sqt%% is apt to have required Seven to supply Optus with a copy of the AFL%%dsh%%Seven Licence ]f[ the purpose of enabling Optus to verify the date on which it could exercise its right of termination under cl 16%%per%%2(a) of the C7%%dsh%%Optus CSA%%cln%% cf Secured Income Real Estate (Australia) Ltd v St Martins Investments Pty Ltd [1979] HCA 51 %%scn%% (1979) 144 CLR 596%%lst%% at 607%%dsh%%608%%lst%% per Mason J%%lst%% quoted with approval by the High Court in Park v Brothers [2005] HCA 73 %%scn%% (2005) 222 ALR 421%%lst%% at 431%%dsh%%432 [38]%%per%% 
3261 I would be inclined to resolve the question of construction in favour of Optus%%lst%% in the sense that I think there might be circumstances in which cl 21(a) of the C7%%dsh%%Optus CSA could have obliged Seven to provide Optus with a copy of the AFL%%dsh%%Seven Licence%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In construing cl 21(a)%%lst%% it is appropriate to take account of the understanding of the parties at the time they entered the C7%%dsh%%Optus CSA%%lst%% particularly their knowledge that ascertaining the date on which Optus could terminate the C7%%dsh%%Optus CSA would require reference to the terms of the AFL%%dsh%%Seven Licence%%cln%% cf Park v Brothers 222 ALR%%lst%% at 432 [39] per curiam %%per%%]$~

~$[The letter made no reference to cl 21(a) of the C7%%dsh%%Optus CSA ]^[ made no suggestion that Seven was obliged to accede to the request%%per%%]$~

3264 Optus sought legal advice before sending its letter%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Whether the absence of any reference in the letter to Seven being obliged to accede to the request was the product of that advice was ]n[ made clear in the evidence%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Whatever the explanation ]f[ the form of the letter%%lst%% Optus never suggested that it was entitled to make the request under the C7%%dsh%%Optus CSA%%lst%% nor that Seven was obliged to comply with the request%%per%%]$~

~$[Mr Wood justified the more sweeping restraint on the ground that otherwise Optus could use the three month period to conclude a deal with a third party%%lst%% ]^[ simply defer signing it until the New Year%%per%%

20%%per%%6%%per%%3%%per%%5 WAS THE EXCLUSIVITY CLAUSE REASONABLE? 
3290 It seems to me that Seven has discharged the burden of showing that the Exclusivity Clause was reasonably necessary ]f[ the protection of the interests of the parties to the First ]^[ Second Variation Agreements ]^[ reasonable in the interests of the public%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Three considerations are of particular importance%%per%% 
3291 First%%lst%% the restraint imposed by the Exclusivity Clause%%lst%% although widely expressed%%lst%% was put in place ]f[ short periods%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It was to continue only ]f[ the term of each of the Variation Agreements%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The initial period during which the exclusivity was to operate was only three months%%per%%]$~ 
~$[That period was extended ]f[ a further period of two months by the Second Variation Agreement%%per%%]$~ 
~$[I was ]n[ referred to any case in which a restraint intended to operate ]f[ such short periods has been held to be void under the common law restraint of trade doctrine%%cln%% cf J D Heydon%%lst%% The Restraint of Trade Doctrine (2nd ed)%%lst%% at 180%%dsh%%182%%per%% 
3292 Secondly%%lst%% C7 ]^[ Optus negotiated on an %%sqt%% equal footing %%sqt%%%%cln%% Amoco v Rocca 133 CLR%%lst%% at 320%%lst%% per Gibbs J%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Whatever issues might arise about Seven%%sqt%%s conduct in attempting to persuade Optus that its right to terminate the C7%%dsh%%Optus CSA was ]n[ exercisable until the start of the 2002 AFL season%%lst%% this is far from a case of a powerful supplier imposing an onerous restraint on a hapless ]^[ helpless customer%%per%% 
3293 Thirdly%%lst%% cl 8A provided an exception ]f[ discussions in negotiations relating to the supply of AFL match ]^[ NRL match broadcasts ]f[ the 2002 season ]v[ any future season%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Thus Optus was ]n[ prevented from engaging in such discussions ]v[ negotiations with Fox Sports ]v[ any other party%%lst%% provided that the resultant term sheet did ]n[ allow those broadcasts to appear on a more favourable tier %%cmp_ta%% the C7 channel%%per%% 
3294 Optus points in its submissions to several matters that it says suggest that the Exclusivity Clause was unreasonable%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In my view%%lst%% none of them%%lst%% individually ]v[ collectively%%lst%% alters the view I have expressed%%per%% 
20%%per%%6%%per%%4 Is the Exclusivity Clause Unenforceable by Reason of the TP Act ? 
20%%per%%6%%per%%4%%per%%1 OPTUS%%sqt%% SUBMISSIONS 
3295 Optus submits that the Exclusivity Clause is caught by s 47(2) of the TP Act %%lst%% which defines conduct amounting to %%sqt%% exclusive dealing %%sqt%%%%per%% 
3296 Optus acknowledges that the prohibition in s 47(1) on the practice of %%sqt%% exclusive dealing %%sqt%% only applies where the conduct %%sqt%% has the purpose ]v[ has ]v[ is likely to have the effect%%lst%% of substantially lessening competition %%sqt%% (s 47(10))%%per%%]$~ 
~$[However%%lst%% it submits that Seven%%sqt%%s purpose in requiring the insertion of the Exclusivity Clause was %%sqt%% nakedly anti%%dsh%%competitive %%sqt%%%%lst%% in that Seven wanted to avoid competition from Fox Sports ]f[ the supply of sports channels to Optus Vision%%per%%]$~ 
~$[While cl 8A operated ]f[ only five months%%lst%% Seven intended it to operate ]f[ a longer period ]^[ to lead to a new three year deal%%per%% 
3297 Optus explains its position in relation to the sports channel supply market as follows%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%The purpose (and likely effect) of the Exclusivity Clauses was to prevent one of the three acquirers in this market (Optus) from acquiring channels from one of the two major channel suppliers (Fox Sports)%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The range of transactions possible in this market is limited by the small number of buyers ]^[ sellers%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The Exclusivity Clauses substantially lessened competition in this market by making it possible ]f[ Optus%%lst%% one of the three buyers%%lst%% to acquire channels from only one of the sellers%%sqt%%%%per%% 
3298 So far as the retail pay television market is concerned%%lst%% Optus says this%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%[Seven%%sqt%%s] case is that in order to offer a viable pay television service in Australia%%lst%% it is necessary to offer attractive Australian sports programming as a subscription driver%%per%%]$~ 
~$[By preventing Optus from obtaining essential sports programming from Fox Sports%%lst%% the Exclusivity Clauses had the purpose (and likely effect) that Optus%%sqt%% ability to overcome its incapacity to constrain Foxtel in the retail market would be impeded in a real ]^[ substantial way%%sqt%%%%per%% 
3299 Optus also relies on s 45(2)(a)(i) of the TP Act %%lst%% which prohibits a corporation from making a contract containing an %%sqt%% exclusionary provision %%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It puts forward several alternative arguments as to why the definition of %%sqt%% exclusionary provision %%sqt%% is satisfied%%lst%% in particular the requirement that a contract be made between persons who are %%sqt%% competitive with each other %%sqt%% ( TP Act %%lst%% s 4D(1)(a))%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Optus contends that the Exclusivity Clause had the purpose of preventing%%lst%% restricting ]v[ limiting the acquisition of sports channels by Optus Vision from %%sqt%% particular persons %%sqt%% (Fox Sports) ]v[ %%sqt%% classes of persons %%sqt%% (sports channel suppliers other %%cmp_ta%% C7) ]^[ thus satisfies the language of s 4D of the TP Act %%per%% 
3300 Finally%%lst%% Optus contends that Seven%%sqt%%s purpose in entering the First ]^[ Second Variation Agreements was to substantially lessen competition%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Thus%%lst%% ]s[ it argues%%lst%% Seven breached s 45(2)(a)(ii) of the TP Act %%per%% 
3301 Optus submits that by reason of the contraventions of the TP Act %%lst%% cl 8A of the C7%%dsh%%Optus CSA%%lst%% as inserted by the First ]^[ Second Variation Agreements%%lst%% is void ]^[ unenforceable%%per%% 
20%%per%%6%%per%%4%%per%%2 EXCLUSIVE DEALING 
3302 In my view%%lst%% Optus cannot establish that s 47(10) of the TP Act is satisfied%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In Chapter 12%%lst%% I have found against the existence of the wholesale sports channel market (upon which Optus relies ]f[ the purposes only of this argument)%%per%% 
3303 None of the experts was asked whether the Exclusivity Clause%%lst%% which was to operate ]f[ two successive periods totalling five months%%lst%% was likely to substantially lessen competition in the retail pay television market (which I have found did exist at the material times)%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Nor do Optus%%sqt%% submissions explain why the restraint imposed by the Exclusivity Clause ]f[ such a short period had the effect ]v[ likely effect of impeding Optus in its efforts (such as they were) to constrain Foxtel in the retail pay television market%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Indeed the submissions run directly counter to the arguments advanced by Optus on other aspects of the case%%per%% 
3304 For similar reasons%%lst%% Optus cannot successfully invoke s 45(2)(a)(ii) of the TP Act %%per%%]$~ 
~$[The Exclusivity Clause has ]n[ been shown to have had the purpose of substantially lessening competition in the retail pay television market%%per%% 
20%%per%%6%%per%%4%%per%%3 EXCLUSIONARY PROVISION 
3305 In my opinion%%lst%% there is no substance to Optus%%sqt%% case insofar as it is based on cl 8A amounting to an %%sqt%% exclusionary provision %%sqt%% ]f[ the purposes of ss 4D ]^[ 45(2)(a)(i) of the TP Act %%per%%]$~ 
~$[The findings I have made %%cmp_e%%where in this judgment would preclude any such case succeeding%%per%%

3306 Optus says that Seven breached its obligation under cl 3A%%per%%2 of the C7%%dsh%%Optus CSA to use its reasonable endeavours to procure that Optus Vision is offered Fox Sports on terms no less favourable %%cmp_ta%% those accorded to any other person%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Optus relies on the fact that Seven produced no documents in response to a notice to produce seeking any documents evidencing steps taken by Seven to comply with cl 3A%%per%%2%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It also relies on the fact that Mr Stokes had become aware by 4 December 2001 that Foxtel ]^[ Optus were engaging in content sharing discussions%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Optus submits that Seven should thereupon have consented to such discussions taking place%%lst%% ]s[ as to relieve Optus from the threat of any non%%dsh%%compliance with cl 8A of the C7%%dsh%%Optus CSA%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Any conflict between cl 3A%%per%%2 ]^[ cl 8A should be resolved in favour of the former%%per%% 
3307 The evidence does ]n[ support Optus%%sqt%% contentions%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Before December 2001%%lst%% Telstra refused to countenance the supply of Fox Sports to Optus%%per%%]$~ 
~$[There was nothing Seven could have done to alter this state of affairs%%per%%]$~

3308 Optus submits that Seven%%sqt%%s knowledge of its content sharing discussions with Foxtel ]^[ Fox Sports%%lst%% taken together with the March Variation Agreement ]^[ the associated programming agreements%%lst%% constituted a waiver of any claim to damages Seven may have had ]f[ breach of the Exclusivity Clause%%per%%]$~

3328 As best I can make out%%lst%% Seven%%sqt%%s case appears to be that Foxtel Cable acquired the rights to the Foxtel exclusive matches shortly after the execution of the last of the Foxtel Put (14 December 2000)%%lst%% the AFL%%dsh%%News Licence (19 December 2000) ]^[ the News%%dsh%%Foxtel Licence (about 25 January 2001)%%per%%]$~ 
~$[At that time%%lst%% Foxtel Cable (in the language of cl 10(1)(e)) acquired the right to televise%%lst%% on a subscription television broadcasting service%%lst%% an event that is specified in a notice under s 115(1) of the BS Act %%per%%]$~ 
~$[The %%sqt%% event %%sqt%% comprised the three Foxtel exclusive matches%%lst%% which were included within the anti%%dsh%%siphoning list%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Seven says that %%cmp_if%% Foxtel Cable acquired its right to televise the AFL exclusive matches at a time when no free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air broadcaster had the right to televise the event%%lst%% Foxtel was in breach of cl 10(1)(e)%%per%% 
3329 Seven%%sqt%%s case makes the assumption that it is irrelevant that the three Foxtel exclusive matches to be shown on pay television could ]n[ be precisely identified until Nine ]^[ Ten had made their selection of five free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air matches in each round%%per%% 
(Pursuant to cl 6 of each of the Nine Put ]^[ Ten Put%%lst%% these selections had to be made by Nine ]^[ Ten six weeks in advance of each round of matches%%per%% 
) Although the assumption is disputed by News%%lst%% I proceed on the basis that it is also correct%%per%%

21%%per%%1%%per%%3%%per%%2 AN UNDERSTANDING AS ALLEGED? 
3332 In the particulars to the Statement of Claim%%lst%% Seven states that the understanding upon which it relies is implicit in the fact that Nine ]^[ Ten had to pay $500,000 ]f[ each Foxtel exclusive match broadcast within 14 days of the day on which the match was played%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In its Closing Submissions%%lst%% Seven does ]n[ base its case simply on the terms of the various licences%%lst%% ]b[ relies on a number of documents to establish the existence of the pleaded understanding%%per%% 
3333 In my view%%lst%% these documents do ]n[ establish that there was an understanding that neither Nine nor Ten would exercise their respective contractual rights to broadcast live the Foxtel exclusive matches upon payment of a fee of $500,000 per match%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The understanding ]s[ far as Nine was concerned was that embodied in the AFL%%dsh%%News Licence ]^[ the Nine Put%%cln%% that is%%lst%% that %%cmp_if%% Nine exercised its rights in respect of any of these matches it would pay $500,000%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In my opinion%%lst%% the position was the same in relation to Ten%%per%% 
3334 None of the Respondents%%sqt%% witnesses was specifically asked about the understanding alleged by Seven%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In particular%%lst%% none was asked whether it was understood that neither Nine nor Ten would exercise its contractual right to broadcast Foxtel exclusive matches upon payment of $500,000 per match%%lst%% even %%cmp_if%% there were sound commercial reasons ]f[ them to do so%%per%%]$~ 
~$[An exchange with Mr Philip took place as follows%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%[MR SUMPTION:] But you do accept that each of [the proposed sub%%dsh%%licensees] appreciated that they were participating in a broader arrangement negotiated by News involving a share%%dsh%%out of rights between three identifiable parties? 
%%dsh%%%%dsh%%%%dsh%% I wouldn%%sqt%%t use the word %%dqt%%share%%dqt%%%%lst%% ]b[ they %%dsh%%%%dsh%%%%dsh%% I think it%%sqt%%s obvious that they knew of each other%%sqt%%s existence%%lst%% ]^[ it%%sqt%%s obvious from the mechanics of the agreements that other entities other %%cmp_ta%% themselves were taking other rights from News%%sqt%%%%per%% 
3335 In this exchange%%lst%% Mr Philip did ]n[ adopt the word %%sqt%% share %%sqt%% ]^[ the matter was ]n[ pursued further%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It is one thing to show that there were multilateral arrangements in place%%lst%% notwithstanding Mr Philip%%sqt%%s heroic attempts to create the impression of a series of independent bilateral agreements%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It is another to establish that the multilateral arrangements encompassed the particular understanding on which Seven relies in its case that Foxtel Cable contravened the anti%%dsh%%siphoning regime%%per%% 
3336 No doubt Foxtel expected that neither Nine nor Ten would choose to exercise its right to broadcast live any of the Foxtel exclusive matches%%per%%]$~ 
~$[That expectation%%lst%% which turned out to be justified%%lst%% would have been based on the knowledge that %%cmp_if%% either chose to exercise its contractual right%%lst%% it would have to pay the very large fee stipulated by the News%%dsh%%Nine Licence ]v[ the News%%dsh%%Ten Licence%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The fact that they had that expectation does ]n[ demonstrate that there was an understanding that neither Nine nor Ten would exercise their respective contractual rights%%lst%% even %%cmp_if%% commercial circumstances warranted them in paying the specified fee%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In my view%%lst%% the evidence does ]n[ establish the existence of an understanding in the terms alleged by Seven%%per%% 
21%%per%%1%%per%%3%%per%%3 A DISPROPORTIONATE PENALTY? 
3337 The second limb of Seven%%sqt%%s argument depends on the so%%dsh%%called %%sqt%% financial penalty %%sqt%% of $500,000 ]f[ broadcasting a Foxtel exclusive match being%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%so disproportionate to the value of the live broadcast rights %%per%%%%per%%%%per%% that it has the effect of preventing the exercise of the %%dqt%%right%%dqt%%%%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The assumption underlying this contention is that a %%sqt%% disproportionate %%sqt%% payment that must be which a party must make %%cmp_if%% it exercises a right to televise a sporting event live%%lst%% in effect negates the existence of that party%%sqt%%s %%sqt%% right to televise the event %%sqt%% within the meaning of cl 10(1)(e) of Pt 6 of Sch 2 to the BS Act %%per%%]$~ 
~$[Again%%lst%% I proceed on the basis that this assumption is correct%%lst%% although it is ]n[ necessarily free from difficulty%%per%% 
3338 Seven%%sqt%%s submissions do ]n[ make it clear how the proportionality of what it describes as the %%sqt%% penalty %%sqt%% ]f[ broadcasting the Foxtel exclusive matches is to be assessed%%per%%]$~ 
~$[As News points out%%lst%% there may be aspects of free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air broadcasting that make the rights to matches very valuable ]f[ reasons that are ]n[ easy to quantify precisely in monetary terms%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In particular%%lst%% the value of a given match ]v[ series of matches may ]n[ merely be reflected in a mathematical calculation derived from the general contractual arrangements entered into ]f[ the AFL free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air ]v[ pay television rights%%per%% 
3339 Seven points out that the figure of $500,000 ]f[ each Foxtel exclusive match was first mooted by Mr Philip in his memorandum to Mr Frykberg of 29 August 2000%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Mr Philip chose that figure%%lst%% ]s[ his memorandum suggests%%lst%% %%cmp_b%% it was %%sqt%% unlikely %%sqt%% that the free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air television operators would broadcast the Foxtel exclusive matches %%cmp_if%% they had to pay the fee%%per%% 
3340 Until December 2000%%lst%% the proposal ]f[ News to acquire the broadcasting rights contemplated that Foxtel would take a sub%%dsh%%licence of the AFL pay television rights ]f[ $17%%per%%5 million per annum (plus adjustments) ]f[ three matches per week%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Nine was to pay $20 million ]f[ three free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air AFL matches per week ]^[ Ten $23 million ]f[ two free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air AFL matches per week plus the finals%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Seven says that the figure of $500,000 per Foxtel exclusive match %%cmp%%s with $265,151 per regular season AFL pay television match ($17%%per%%5 million divided by 66 regular season AFL pay television matches)%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Following this logic%%lst%% the figure of $500,000 per match can be %%cmp%%d with $363,636 per regular season AFL free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air television match ($40 million%%lst%% after making an allowance ]f[ finals matches%%lst%% divided by 110 regular season AFL free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air matches)%%per%% 
3341 By the time the various put agreements ]^[ licence agreements came into force%%lst%% Foxtel had agreed to pay $30 million per annum (plus adjustments) ]f[ the pay television rights to three AFL matches each week of the regular season%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The value of each Foxtel exclusive match%%lst%% assessed on a purely mathematical calculation%%lst%% was %%cmp_tf%% $454,545 ($30 million divided by 66 regular AFL season matches)%%per%%]$~ 
~$[This figure is only marginally (less %%cmp_ta%% 10 per cent) lower %%cmp_ta%% the figure of $500,000 per Foxtel exclusive match specified in the News%%dsh%%Nine Licence ]^[ the News%%dsh%%Ten Licence%%per%% 
3342 On this material%%lst%% I cannot conclude that the fee provided by the News%%dsh%%Nine Licence ]^[ the News%%dsh%%Ten Licence ]f[ each Foxtel exclusive match constituted a %%sqt%% penalty %%sqt%% ]s[ disproportionate that it effectively prevented Nine ]^[ Ten from exercising their contractual rights to broadcast any ]v[ all of the Foxtel exclusive matches%%per%%]$~

~$[The structure ]^[ detail of any statutory anti%%dsh%%siphoning regime are%%lst%% of course%%lst%% matters ]f[ Parliament%%per%%]$~ 
~$[So%%lst%% too%%lst%% are the merits of the policies underlying any such regime%%per%% 
3344 The current regime appears to involve a mixture of objectives%%per%%]$~ 
~$[At one level%%lst%% the aim is presumably to ensure (or at least encourage) the live broadcasting of certain popular sporting events on free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air television%%lst%% rather %%cmp_ta%% have live coverage reserved exclusively ]f[ pay television subscribers%%per%%]$~ 
~$[At another level%%lst%% the regime may be designed to provide a form of programming protectionism in favour of free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air television operators ]^[ against the interests of pay television platforms%%per%%]$~ 
~$[To the extent that the statutory regime serves the latter purpose%%lst%% the form of the current regime may reflect successful lobbying of successive Governments by free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air television operators%%lst%% rather %%cmp_ta%% broader public policy objectives%%per%% 
3345 Whatever the objectives of the current anti%%dsh%%siphoning regime%%lst%% the time may have arrived ]f[ a review of its practical operation%%per%%]$~ 
~$[This case reveals the techniques that have been employed ]f[ allocating %%sqt%% marquee %%sqt%% sporting rights between free%%dsh%%to%%dsh%%air television operators ]^[ pay television platforms%%per%%]$~

3355 Seven in its Reply Submissions dismisses out of hand News%%sqt%% contention that it is difficult to see how Seven%%sqt%%s s 45D claim can have any practical significance in this litigation%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Seven points out that liability under s 45D of the TP Act does ]n[ depend on a finding that the alleged contravener had the purpose%%lst%% ]v[ the relevant conduct had the effect ]v[ likely effect%%lst%% of substantially lessening competition in a market%%per%%]$~ 
~$[While that proposition is correct%%lst%% it does ]n[ in my view overcome the problem identified by News having regard to the findings I have made%%per%%

~$[Those allegations are framed in terms of a purpose ]v[ effect of substantially lessening competition in specified markets%%per%%]$~

21%%per%%2%%per%%4%%per%%2 HINDERING OR PREVENTING 
3358 A further difficulty facing Seven%%lst%% in my view%%lst%% is that its case is inconsistent with the holding of a majority of the High Court in Devenish v Jewel Food Stores Pty Ltd [1991] HCA 7 %%scn%% (1991) 172 CLR 32 (Brennan%%lst%% Dawson ]^[ Toohey JJ%%scn%% Mason CJ ]^[ Deane J dissenting)%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In that case%%lst%% a group of milk vendors in New South Wales%%lst%% each with a regional monopoly%%lst%% acted in concert to withhold supplies of milk from Jewel%%lst%% which conducted a supermarket chain in New South Wales%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The purpose ]^[ likely effect of the conduct was to damage Jewel ]^[ to force it to cease purchasing milk from Victorian suppliers%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Jewel claimed relief against the milk vendors by reason of their alleged contravention of s 45D(1)(b) of the TP Act %%per%%]$~ 
~$[Section 45D at that time was in a different form%%lst%% ]b[ Seven does ]n[ suggest that the drafting changes to s 45D effected in 1996 by the Workplace Relations ]^[ Other Legislation Amendment Act 1996 (Cth)%%lst%% Sch 17%%lst%% are material to the present question%%per%% 
3360 The High Court%%lst%% by majority%%lst%% allowed the appeal of the milk vendors%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Their Honours held that conduct which prevents a fourth person (Jewel) from acquiring supplies%%lst%% does ]n[ constitute conduct which hinders ]v[ prevents third persons (Jewel%%sqt%%s customers) from acquiring goods ]v[ services from the fourth person (Jewel)%%per%% 
3361 Brennan J%%lst%% with whom Dawson J agreed%%lst%% identified the question (172 CLR%%lst%% at 46)%%lst%% as whether%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%the withholding of goods from a corporation whose business is the purchase ]^[ resale of goods amounts to conduct which hinders ]v[ prevents the acquisition by the corporation%%sqt%%s customers of the goods withheld%%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Brennan J accepted that%%lst%% since the target%%sqt%%s customers are unable to obtain the goods withheld from the target%%lst%% there is a sense in which acquisition of those goods can be said to be hindered ]v[ prevented by conduct which consists merely in the hindering ]v[ preventing of supplies to the target%%per%%]$~ 
~$[However%%lst%% his Honour noted (172 CLR%%lst%% at 47) that s 45D(1)%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%proscribes conduct which hinders ]v[ prevents supply to a target corporation (%%dqt%%a fourth person%%dqt%%) ]v[ which hinders ]v[ prevents acquisition from a target corporation%%scn%% it does ]n[ proscribe conduct which hinders ]v[ prevents acquisition ]v[ supply by a target corporation%%per%%]$~ 
~$[True it is that supply ]^[ acquisition are reciprocal activities but%%lst%% as s%%per%% 45D(1) is expressed to relate only to supply to ]^[ acquisition from a target corporation%%lst%% it distinguishes between those activities ]^[ the activities which are reciprocal to them%%per%%]$~ 
~$[To give effect to that distinction%%lst%% it is necessary to exclude from the net of s%%per%% 45D(1) conduct which impedes an activity mentioned in the sub%%dsh%%section (supply to ]v[ acquisition from a target corporation) merely by impeding the reciprocal activity which the sub%%dsh%%section does ]n[ mention (acquisition ]v[ supply by a target corporation)%%per%%]$~ 
~$[I would construe s%%per%% 45D(1) as requiring proof of conduct other %%cmp_ta%% mere hindering ]v[ preventing of the supply of goods by the target corporation before it can be said that acquisition of those goods ]^[ services from the target corporation is hindered ]v[ prevented%%sqt%%%%per%% 
(Emphasis in original%%per%% 
) 
3362 Brennan J explained (172 CLR%%lst%% at 47) the result as follows%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%In this case the [milk vendors] took no steps to hinder the acquisition by Jewel%%sqt%%s customers of whatever goods Jewel had available ]f[ sale%%scn%% the [milk vendors] simply failed to supply Jewel with New South Wales milk which Jewel could have supplied to the customers who sought it%%per%%]$~ 
~$[For the reason stated%%lst%% this did ]n[ amount to conduct which%%lst%% in the sense in which s%%per%% 45D(1) uses the terms%%lst%% hindered ]v[ prevented Jewel%%sqt%%s customers from acquiring New South Wales milk %%dsh%%%%dsh%%%%dsh%% ]v[ any other milk%%lst%% ]f[ that matter %%dsh%%%%dsh%%%%dsh%% from Jewel%%cln%% there was simply no New South Wales milk available ]f[ acquisition%%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[See%%lst%% too%%lst%% 172 CLR%%lst%% at 53%%lst%% per Dawson J%%scn%% at 57%%dsh%%58%%lst%% per Toohey J%%per%% 
3364 In my opinion%%lst%% the first ground rests on a distinction without a difference%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It is hard to see why the ratio of Devenish v Jewel should be confined to the case where there is identity between the goods ]v[ services withheld from the target corporation (or which the target is prevented from acquiring) ]^[ the goods ]v[ services the target%%sqt%%s customers are thereby prevented from acquiring%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Particularly is this ]s[ where the target (C7) claims that the services that its customers cannot acquire (C7%%sqt%%s channels) are unavailable precisely %%cmp_b%% the parties acting in concert have prevented the target from acquiring an ingredient (AFL sporting content) that it says is essential to the supply of the services (the channels) to the target%%sqt%%s customers%%per%% 
3365 The second ground also seems to me to rest on a distinction without a difference%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Seven%%sqt%%s case is that the AFL pay television rights were central to C7%%sqt%%s very survival%%lst%% ]n[ least %%cmp_b%% the loss of the AFL pay television rights exposed it to the loss of the benefits of the C7%%dsh%%Optus CSA ]^[ of the C7%%dsh%%Austar CSA%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The reasoning of the majority in Devenish v Jewel does ]n[ suggest that the result in that case would have been different %%cmp_if%% the goods withheld from Jewel had been essential to its very survival as a supermarket chain%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Had the goods been essential to Jewel%%sqt%%s survival%%lst%% it would presumably have sustained even greater loss ]v[ damage to its business %%cmp_ta%% was occasioned ]v[ threatened by the conduct of the milk vendors%%per%%]$~ 
~$[But the reasoning of the majority would still have prevented Jewel from gaining redress pursuant to s 45D(1) of the TP Act %%per%%]$~ 
~$[Whether Jewel might have had a cause of action under any other provision of the TP Act is a separate question%%per%%

~$[Seven argues that it is ]n[ necessary ]f[ all parties to a contract containing an exclusionary provision to be competitive with each other%%lst%% ]s[ long as at least two of the parties are competitive in this way%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It is %%cmp_tf%% irrelevant that Fox Sports was ]n[ in competition with Foxtel ]v[ Optus%%per%% 
3374 The Statement of Claim does ]n[ expressly plead that the contraventions of s 45(2)(a)(i) ]^[ (b)(i) by the parties to the Optus%%dsh%%NRL Licence caused Seven loss ]v[ damage%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Seven%%sqt%%s Closing Submissions make no reference to any loss ]v[ damage said to flow from the contraventions%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Nor is any mention made of how an award of damages%%lst%% presumably pursuant to s 82 of the TP Act %%lst%% might be calculated%%per%% 
3375 In these circumstances%%lst%% it is hardly surprising that News ]^[ PBL argue in their written submissions that Seven has failed to identify any loss ]v[ damage attributable to the alleged contraventions%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It follows%%lst%% ]s[ they contend%%lst%% that Seven cannot be awarded any damages%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Perhaps out of an abundance of caution%%lst%% News%%sqt%% written submissions also provide reasons why a damages claim would fail in any event%%per%% 
3376 Not ]f[ the first time%%lst%% Seven%%sqt%%s Reply submissions raise a new issue%%per%% 
3377 The belated identification of Seven%%sqt%%s damages claim founded in cl 9 of the Optus%%dsh%%NRL Licence naturally prompted a reply from Mr Hutley in his oral submissions%%per%%]$~ 
~$[He submitted that Seven%%sqt%%s damages claim was misconceived%%per%% 
21%%per%%3%%per%%4 Reasoning 
21%%per%%3%%per%%4%%per%%1 DAMAGES 
3378 It is convenient to commence with Seven%%sqt%%s claims that it is entitled to damages by reason of cl 9 of the Optus%%dsh%%NRL Licence constituting an %%sqt%% exclusionary provision %%sqt%% ]f[ the purposes of s 45(2) of the TP Act %%per%%]$~ 
~$[If Seven%%sqt%%s damages claim lacks substance%%lst%% the only other relief sought by Seven are the declarations set out earlier%%per%% 
3379 I must confess to considerable difficulty in following Seven%%sqt%%s damages claim%%lst%% insofar as it is founded on cl 9 of the Optus%%dsh%%NRL Licence%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Seven%%sqt%%s Reply Submissions start with the proposition%%lst%% apparently central to its damages case based on cl 9 of the Optus%%dsh%%NRL Licence%%lst%% that ]b[ ]f[ Optus%%sqt%% unlawful conduct in relation to C7 (misleading ]v[ deceptive conduct%%lst%% deceit ]^[ breach of contract)%%lst%% Optus would at some point in late 2001 ]v[ early 2002 have entered a new content supply agreement with C7 in place of the C7%%dsh%%Optus CSA%%per%%]$~ 
~$[As I read Seven%%sqt%%s Reply Submissions%%lst%% they make Seven%%sqt%%s damages claim based on cl 9 of the Optus%%dsh%%NRL Licence dependent on the success of its other causes of action against Optus%%per%% 
3380 In Chapter 20%%lst%% I have rejected Seven%%sqt%%s case against Optus founded on misleading ]v[ deceptive conduct%%lst%% deceit ]^[ breach of contract%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It would seem to follow%%lst%% given the way Seven presents its damages claim%%lst%% that it cannot establish any loss ]v[ damage flowing from any contravention of s 45(2) of the TP Act by reason of the inclusion of cl 9 in the Optus%%dsh%%NRL Licence%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In any event%%lst%% it is difficult to see what loss ]v[ damage%%lst%% whether in the form of a lost opportunity ]v[ otherwise%%lst%% could be said to have been suffered by Seven %%sqt%% by %%sqt%% the conduct of the parties to the Optus%%dsh%%NRL Licence responsible ]f[ the inclusion of cl 9%%lst%% assuming that their conduct contravened s 45(2) of the TP Act %%lst%% ( TP Act %%lst%% s 82(1))%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Clause 9 of the Optus%%dsh%%NRL Licence must be placed in the context of a much larger canvas%%per%% 
3381 The Optus%%dsh%%NRL Licence was executed on ]v[ about 25 January 2001%%per%%]$~ 
~$[During the preceding three years%%lst%% C7 had ]n[ held the NRL pay television rights and%%lst%% indeed%%lst%% had never held the NRL pay television rights%%per%%]$~ 
~$[From 1998 to 2000%%lst%% Optus held the non%%dsh%%exclusive NRL pay television rights by way of a sub%%dsh%%licence from News pursuant to the Optus Pay TV Programming Agreement%%per%% 
3382 Under cl 4%%per%%5 of the C7%%dsh%%Optus CSA%%lst%% C7 was obliged%%lst%% while Optus held NRL pay television rights%%lst%% to include NRL programming in the C7 channels at no additional cost to Optus%%lst%% unless Optus elected otherwise%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Although Optus was obliged to bear the costs of production of NRL matches ]f[ broadcast on its platform%%lst%% C7 derived no additional revenue from supplying the NRL coverage to Optus through its channels%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In consequence%%lst%% as News points out%%lst%% C7 simply had a sub%%dsh%%licence from Optus to incorporate NRL programming into the C7 channels supplied to Optus (but ]n[ to any other pay television operator%%lst%% such as Austar)%%per%% 
3383 Clause 9 of the Optus%%dsh%%NRL Licence prevented Optus from sub%%dsh%%licensing%%lst%% altering ]v[ rebranding the %%sqt%% NRL on Optus %%sqt%% channel which was to be provided ]f[ the 2001 NRL season (February to the end of September 2001)%%per%%]$~ 
~$[During this period%%lst%% the C7 channels continued to be supplied to Optus%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The channels included %%sqt%% marquee %%sqt%% sports content %%cmp_b%% C7 retained the AFL pay television rights notwithstanding the events of December 2000%%lst%% until the end of the 2001 AFL season%%per%% 
3384 In the absence of cl 9 of the Optus%%dsh%%NRL Licence%%lst%% the likelihood is that the previous arrangement between Optus ]^[ C7 in relation to NRL coverage would have continued ]f[ the term of the Optus%%dsh%%NRL Licence%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Seven submits that%%lst%% ]b[ ]f[ the parties to the Optus%%dsh%%NRL Licence agreeing to the insertion of cl 9 ]^[ giving effect to its terms%%lst%% C7 would have been in a position to make a valuable contribution to Optus%%lst%% enabling Optus to broadcast a %%sqt%% consolidated sports offering including one premium sport namely%%lst%% the NRL %%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Hence%%lst%% ]s[ it argues%%lst%% Optus would have been more likely to enter a new content supply agreement with C7%%per%% 
3385 Seven seems to accept that C7 derived no revenue from the placement of NRL programming in the channels supplied to Optus%%scn%% that C7 had premium sporting content on its own channels in 2001 in the form of AFL programming%%scn%% that the Optus%%dsh%%NRL Licence lasted only ]f[ the 2001 NRL season%%scn%% ]^[ that there were many factors that contributed to Optus terminating the C7%%dsh%%Optus CSA ]^[ ]n[ replacing it with any further content supply agreement with C7%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Seven does ]n[ point to any evidence suggesting that%%lst%% had Optus retained the ability to incorporate NRL programming into the C7 channels during the 2001 season%%lst%% that would have made the slightest difference to the course of events%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In particular%%lst%% Seven does ]n[ identify any evidence supporting its contention that C7%%lst%% in those circumstances%%lst%% would have had better prospects of securing a further content supply agreement from Optus%%per%% 
3386 No such proposition was put to any of Optus%%sqt%% witnesses%%per%%]$~ 
~$[More importantly%%lst%% the events leading to Optus%%sqt%% decision to terminate the C7%%dsh%%Optus CSA ]^[ enter into the Foxtel%%dsh%%Optus Term Sheet ]^[ the subsequent Foxtel%%dsh%%Optus CSA do ]n[ provide any basis ]f[ thinking that removing cl 9 from the Optus%%dsh%%NRL Licence would have increased C7%%sqt%%s chances of securing a further content supply agreement from Optus%%per%%]$~ 
~$[These events came about %%cmp_b%% of CMM%%sqt%%s poor financial performance%%lst%% the resolution of the disputes among the Foxtel partners ]^[ C7%%sqt%%s loss of the AFL pay television rights%%per%%]$~ 
~$[They were ]n[ influenced by Optus%%sqt%% inability to place NRL programming on branded C7 channels during the 2001 NRL season%%per%% 
3387 The suggestion that cl 9 of the Optus%%dsh%%NRL Licence denied C7 the opportunity to bid ]f[ the AFL ]v[ NRL pay television rights ]f[ 2007 ]^[ beyond as an operating business%%lst%% in my opinion%%lst%% is fanciful%%per%% 
21%%per%%3%%per%%4%%per%%2 CLAIM FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF 
3388 In resisting Seven%%sqt%%s claim ]f[ declaratory relief in relation to cl 9 of the Optus%%dsh%%NRL Licence%%lst%% the Respondents%%lst%% as is customary in this case%%lst%% advance many arguments%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Not all appear to be particularly compelling%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It is necessary%%lst%% however%%lst%% only to consider their submission that Seven has ]n[ established that Foxtel ]^[ Optus were %%sqt%% competitive with each other %%sqt%% within the meaning of s 4D(1) of the TP Act %%per%% 
3389 The resolution of this issue turns on s 4D(2) of the TP Act which provides%%lst%% relevantly%%lst%% as follows%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%A person shall be deemed to be competitive with another person ]f[ the purposes of subsection (1) %%cmp_if%%%%lst%% ]^[ only %%cmp_if%%%%lst%% the first%%dsh%%mentioned person %%per%%%%per%%%%per%% is%%lst%% ]v[ is likely to be%%lst%% or%%lst%% ]b[ ]f[ the provision of any contract %%per%%%%per%%%%per%% would be%%lst%% ]v[ would be likely to be%%lst%% in competition with the other person %%per%%%%per%%%%per%% in relation to the supply ]v[ acquisition of all ]v[ any of the goods ]v[ services to which the relevant provision of the contract %%per%%%%per%%%%per%% relates%%sqt%%%%per%% 
3390 It appears to be common ground that the time ]f[ assessing whether a person is ]v[ is likely to be in competition with another person%%lst%% ]f[ the purposes of s 4D(2)%%lst%% is the time at which the relevant contract is entered into%%cln%% Australian Competition ]^[ Consumer Commission v Visy Paper Pty Ltd (2000) 186 ALR 731%%lst%% at 757 [133]%%lst%% per Sackville J%%lst%% ]^[ cases cited there (reversed on other grounds%%cln%% Australian Competition ]^[ Consumer Commission v Visy Paper Pty Ltd [2001] FCA 1075 %%scn%% (2001) 112 FCR 37%%scn%% Visy Paper Pty Ltd v Australian Competition ]^[ Consumer Commission [2003] HCA 59 %%scn%% (2003) 216 CLR 1)%%per%%]$~ 
~$[As Seven points out%%lst%% s 4D(2) speaks ]n[ only of persons who are in competition with each other%%lst%% ]b[ of those who are likely to be in competition with each other%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In this context%%lst%% as I have explained %%cmp_e%%where ([2231]%%dsh%%[2233])%%lst%% %%sqt%% likely %%sqt%% means a %%sqt%% real chance ]v[ possibility %%sqt%%%%per%% 
3391 Seven identifies the critical question to be whether%%lst%% as at 25 January 2001 (the date of the execution of the Optus%%dsh%%NRL Licence)%%lst%% there was a real chance ]v[ possibility that Foxtel ]^[ Optus would be in competition ]f[ the acquisition of channels incorporating NRL programming%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Seven propose an affirmative answer to this question%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Seven acknowledges that by 25 January 2001%%lst%% Foxtel had secured the Fox Sports channels containing NRL content until 2006%%per%%]$~ 
~$[However%%lst%% Seven argues that%%lst%% at the expiration of that period%%lst%% Foxtel ]^[ Optus again would be %%sqt%% likely to be %%sqt%% in competition ]f[ the acquisition of a channel with NRL programming%%per%% 
3392 PBL relies on the closing words of s 4D(2) to support a narrow construction of the %%sqt%% services %%sqt%% in respect of which competition ]v[ likely competition must exist%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Those words refer to two ]v[ more persons who are%%lst%% ]v[ are likely to be%%lst%% in competition%%cln%% 
%%sqt%%in relation to the supply ]v[ acquisition of all ]v[ any of the %%per%%%%per%%%%per%% services to which the relevant provision of the contract %%per%%%%per%%%%per%% relates%%sqt%%%%per%% 
3393 PBL argues that the only services to which cl 9 of the Optus%%dsh%%NRL Licence relate are either the 2001 %%sqt%% NRL on Optus %%sqt%% channel itself%%lst%% ]v[ the NRL content included in that channel ]f[ the 2001 season%%per%%]$~ 
~$[PBL says that Foxtel ]^[ Optus could ]n[ have been in competition (or likely to be in competition) ]f[ these services simply %%cmp_b%% Foxtel had already acquired them before 25 January 2001%%per%% 
3394 In my view%%lst%% PBL%%sqt%%s submissions take too narrow a view of the expression %%sqt%% services to which the relevant provision of the contract %%per%%%%per%%%%per%% relates %%sqt%%%%per%%]$~ 
~$[As Seven points out%%lst%% PBL effectively contends that an agreement ]f[ the supply of goods ]v[ services %%sqt%% relates %%sqt%% only to the particular goods ]v[ services which are the subject matter of the agreement%%per%%]$~ 
~$[If this interpretation is correct%%lst%% s 4D would have little room ]f[ operation%%lst%% since the particular goods ]v[ services will usually be within the exclusive control of the supplier before the parties enter into the supply agreement%%per%% 
3395 There is%%lst%% however%%lst%% another obstacle confronting Seven%%sqt%%s argument%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Seven maintains that there was a real chance ]v[ possibility%%lst%% as at 25 January 2001%%lst%% that Foxtel ]^[ Optus would compete ]f[ the acquisition of channels incorporating NRL content%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Seven does ]n[ explain what form that competition would ]v[ might take%%per%% 
3396 If Seven means that there was a real chance ]v[ possibility that Foxtel ]^[ Optus would compete ]f[ the exclusive right to take a sports channel with NRL content%%lst%% that had ]n[ happened prior to January 2001%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The reason is that the arrangements in relation to the supply of NRL content to Foxtel ]^[ Optus were governed by the 1998 Super League settlement%%per%%]$~ 
~$[At the time the Optus%%dsh%%NRL Licence came into effect%%lst%% there was no reason to think that there was anything more %%cmp_ta%% the remotest prospect of Optus competing with Foxtel ]f[ the exclusive right to take NRL sports channels%%per%% 
3397 If Seven means that there was a real chance ]v[ possibility%%lst%% some years down the track%%lst%% that Foxtel ]^[ Optus might each seek non%%dsh%%exclusive access to NRL sports channels%%lst%% that prospect would ]n[ put them in competition ]f[ the channels%%per%%]$~ 
~$[If one obtained non%%dsh%%exclusive access to the channels in%%lst%% say%%lst%% 2006 ]v[ beyond%%lst%% that would ]n[ preclude ]v[ inhibit the other from gaining similar non%%dsh%%exclusive access%%per%% 
3398 In any event%%lst%% as at 25 January 2001%%lst%% as I have found in Chapter 18%%lst%% Optus%%sqt%% future as a retail pay television provider was very doubtful%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The only realistic possibilities open to Optus were to negotiate a content supply agreement with Foxtel (which eventuated) ]v[ implement a Manage ]f[ Cash strategy in relation to CMM%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In neither case was there a real chance ]v[ possibility that Optus would compete with Foxtel ]f[ the acquisition of an NRL sports channel or%%lst%% indeed%%lst%% ]f[ any other pay television sports channel%%per%% 
21%%per%%3%%per%%5 Conclusion 
3399 In my view%%lst%% Seven has ]n[ established its claim either ]f[ damages ]v[ declarations in relation to cl 9 of the Optus%%dsh%%NRL Licence%%per%%
