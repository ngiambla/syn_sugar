Smart City is a concept that has gained increased attention in academic%%lst%% industrial%%lst%% 
]^[ governmental circles%%per%%]$~ ~$[While the urban population is growing%%lst%% the infrastructure 
]^[ resources required to support citizens are often insuf cient%%lst%% leading to a degrada%%dsh%%

tant tools to reduce this problem%%lst%% helping to improve the sustainable use of resources%%lst%%

~$[Using a software platform rather %%cmp_ta%% ad hoc solutions is a more robust ]^[ sustain%%dsh%% 
able way to support the features needed by a Smart City environment%%per%%]$~ ~$[In this paper%%lst%% 
we surveyed the current research on Smart Cities platforms%%lst%% aiming to discover theirs 
most relevant requirements ]^[ how to facilitate the development%%lst%% integration%%lst%% ]^[

~$[Based on the analyzed projects%%lst%% we derived a uni ed reference architecture sup%%dsh%%

~$[Thus%%lst%% this paper contributes to the state%%dsh%%of%%dsh%%the%%dsh%%art by providing a guide to help soft%%dsh%%

~$[The reference architecture is based on the answers of the three research sub%%dsh%%

swering RQ2 ( What are the requirements that a software platform ]f[ Smart Cities 
should meet? )%%lst%% we could relate these technologies to the requirements that a soft%%dsh%%

~$[In contrast%%lst%% it helps to decide which technology to use when a speci c functional ]v[
