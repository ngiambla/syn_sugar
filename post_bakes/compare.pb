HE PAST DECADE 
We would like to begin by stating that EX/RP%%lst%% as we use 
it here%%lst%% does ]n[ refer to a theoretical stance%%lst%% ]b[ rather 
refers to a collection of treatment techniques that were 
borne from behavioral theory%%per%%]$~ ~$[As the name implies%%lst%% EX/ 
RP is a collection of therapeutic techniques aimed at 
teaching an individual to approach%%lst%% rather %%cmp%% avoid%%lst%% 
fear%%dsh%%producing stimuli (exposure) coupled with the prevention of fear%%dsh%%neutralizing rituals (response prevention)%%per%%]$~ 
~$[That being said%%lst%% it would be misleading to suggest that we 
do ]n[ frequently employ other treatment techniques%%lst%% 
such as those commonly used in treatment packages that 
emphasize more cognitively%%dsh%%based techniques (see Chosak%%lst%% Marques%%lst%% Fama%%lst%% Renaud%%lst%% Wilhelm%%lst%% 2009)%%per%%]$~ ~$[Together%%lst%% 
this collection of techniques is frequently referred to as 
CBT%%per%%]$~ ~$[We do ]n[ consider the more cognitive techniques 
included in these packages to be inconsistent with 
behavioral theory nor with EX/RP%%per%%1 We view them as 
ancillary techniques that can be used within a treatment

~$[It is also important to note from the outset that the 
cause of OCD remains unknown ]^[ no single model 
]v[ theory ]y[ proposed%%lst%% including behavioral theory%%lst%% is 
able to fully explain how ]v[ why OCD develops (Taylor%%lst%% 
Abramowitz%%lst%% & McKay%%lst%% 2007)%%per%%]$~ ~$[Further%%lst%% there are no 
data to support any single theory in accounting ]f[ the

factors%%per%%]$~ ~$[Just as psychopharmacological interventions 
have spawned from our understanding of the underlying biological processes involved in OCD%%lst%% CBT has 
risen from our understanding of underlying behavioral 
processes involved in OCD%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Theoretical Rationale ]f[ EX/RP 
Early learning models of OCD were based largely on a 
two%%dsh%%factor theory of fear (Dollard & Miller%%lst%% 1950%%scn%% Mowrer%%lst%% 
1951%%lst%% 1960)%%per%%]$~ ~$[The two%%dsh%%factor model proposes that when an 
individual is faced with a situation that elicits a physiological fear ]v[ anxiety state%%lst%% an unconditioned (i%%per%%e%%per%%%%lst%% 
unlearned) behavioral reaction to escape that state is 
initiated%%per%%]$~ ~$[If the action is successful in reducing the anxiety%%lst%% 
it is streng%%cmp%%ed%%lst%% through negative reinforcement%%lst%% ]^[ 
thus is more likely to be reproduced in the presence of 
similar anxiety%%dsh%%producing stimuli in the future%%per%%]$~ ~$[Through 
learning experiences%%lst%% various internal (e%%per%%g%%per%%%%lst%% thoughts ]^[ 
images) ]^[ external (i%%per%%e%%per%%%%lst%% contextual) stimuli acquire the 
ability to elicit anxiety ]^[ the ensuing escape response%%per%%]$~ 
~$[When the escape response is performed “compulsively” in 
response to benign (albeit distress%%dsh%%evoking) stimuli%%lst%% one is 
said to suffer from OCD%%per%%]$~ 
~$[EX/RP is based on the assumption that %%cmp%% an individual 
is systematically exposed to stimuli that elicit obsessional 
thoughts ]^[ associated anxiety%%lst%% ]^[ is prevented from 
escaping ]v[ otherwise neutralizing the anxiety (ritual 
prevention)%%lst%% the anxiety will diminish over time through 
the process of extinction ]^[ the person will be better 
able to function in his/her daily life%%per%%]$~ ~$[Theorists such as Foa 
]^[ Kozak (1986) have posited that habituation is aided 
by exposure to corrective information in that the 
individual learns%%lst%% through direct experience%%lst%% that the 
feared consequences do ]n[ materialize in the situations 
that typically evoke obsessional distress%%per%%]$~ ~$[With repetition%%lst%% 
the reduction of anxiety in the previously feared situation 
makes it easier in the long run to resist the weaker urges to 
escape and/or ritualize%%per%%]$~ 
~$[From a practical standpoint%%lst%% a behavioral conceptualization focuses on the here%%dsh%%and%%dsh%%now functional relation%%dsh%% 
ship between an individual’s obsessions ]^[ compulsions%%lst%% 
with the assumption that this relationship can be modified 
in treatment without necessarily understanding the 
“cause” of the obsessions%%per%%]$~ ~$[Furthermore%%lst%% the specific 
content ]v[ form of the obsessions ]^[ compulsions is 
relatively unimportant except to the extent that they set 
the context ]f[ preparing specific treatment exercises%%per%%]$~ ~$[For 
example%%lst%% a person who reports distress related to 
repetitive%%lst%% intrusive thoughts of harming their spouse 
might engage in one ]v[ more forms of compulsive 
behavior to reduce this distress%%per%%]$~ ~$[Examples might include 
frequent “checking in,” taking measures to avoid situations perceived as “high risk,” ]v[ elaborate mental rituals%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In each of these examples%%lst%% the common underlying theme 
is the repetitive performance of one ]v[ more rituals that 
functions to remove ]v[ avoid the distress associated with 
obsessional thoughts%%per%%]$~ ~$[In each case%%lst%% the individual can 
learn to manage his/her OCD using EX/RP without 
necessarily knowing how the obsession developed%%per%%]$~ ~$[In fact%%lst%% 
throughout the course of EX/RP%%lst%% analyzing the nature 
]^[ cause of one’s obsessions is actively discouraged as this 
often leads the person to “fight” with the obsessions%%lst%% which 
is likely to ultimately make them worse%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Empirical Support ]f[ EX/RP ]f[ OCD 
A review of the research literature shows strong 
support ]f[ EX/RP as a treatment ]f[ OCD%%per%%]$~ ~$[Several 
recent qualitative ]^[ quantitative (i%%per%%e%%per%%%%lst%% meta%%dsh%%analytic) 
literature reviews have evaluated ]^[ critiqued the CBT 
]f[ OCD literature ]^[ each has concluded that CBT is 
an effective treatment ]f[ reducing OCD in adults ]^[
