~$[The Time Machine%%lst%% by H(erbert) G(eorge) Wells [1898] 
The Time Traveller (for ]s[ it will be convenient to speak of 
him) was expounding a recondite matter to us%%per%%]$~ ~$[His grey eyes 
shone ]^[ twinkled%%lst%% ]^[ his usually pale face was flushed ]^[ 
animated%%per%%]$~ ~$[The fire burned brightly%%lst%% ]^[ the soft radiance of the 
incandescent lights in the lilies of silver caught the bubbles 
that flashed ]^[ passed in our glasses%%per%%]$~ ~$[Our chairs%%lst%% being his 
patents%%lst%% embraced ]^[ caressed us rather %%cmp_ta%% submitted to be sat 
upon%%lst%% ]^[ there was that luxurious after%%dsh%%dinner atmosphere when 
thought roams gracefully free of the trammels of precision%%per%%]$~ ~$[And 
he put it to us in this way%%dsh%%%%dsh%%marking the points with a lean 
forefinger%%dsh%%%%dsh%%as we sat ]^[ lazily admired his earnestness over 
this new paradox (as we thought it:) ]^[ his fecundity%%per%% 
`You must follow me carefully%%per%%]$~ ~$[I shall have to controvert one 
]v[ two ideas that are almost universally accepted%%per%%]$~ ~$[The geometry%%lst%% 
]f[ instance%%lst%% they taught you at school is founded on a 
misconception%%per%%%%sqt%% 
`Is ]n[ that rather a large thing to expect us to begin upon?%%sqt%% 
said Filby%%lst%% an argumentative person with red hair%%per%% 
`I do ]n[ mean to ask you to accept anything without reasonable 
ground ]f[ it%%per%%]$~ ~$[You will soon admit as much as I need from you%%per%%]$~ 
~$[You know of course that a mathematical line%%lst%% a line of thickness 
NIL%%lst%% has no real existence%%per%%]$~ ~$[They taught you that%%qsn%%]$~ ~$[Neither has 
a mathematical plane%%per%%]$~ ~$[These things are mere abstractions%%per%%%%sqt%% 
`That is all right,%%sqt%% said the Psychologist%%per%% 
`Nor%%lst%% having only length%%lst%% breadth%%lst%% ]^[ thickness%%lst%% can a cube 
have a real existence%%per%%%%sqt%% 
`There I object,%%sqt%% said Filby%%per%% `Of course a solid body may 
exist%%per%%]$~ ~$[All real things%%dsh%%%%dsh%%%%sqt%% 
`So most people think%%per%%]$~ ~$[But wait a moment%%per%%]$~ ~$[Can an 
INSTANTANEOUS cube exist?%%sqt%% 
`Don%%sqt%%t follow you,%%sqt%% said Filby%%per%% 
`Can a cube that does ]n[ last ]f[ any time at all%%lst%% have a real 
existence?%%sqt%% 
Filby became pensive%%per%% `Clearly,%%sqt%% the Time Traveller proceeded%%lst%% 
`any real body must have extension in FOUR directions%%cln%% it must 
have Length%%lst%% Breadth%%lst%% Thickness%%lst%% and%%dsh%%%%dsh%%Duration%%per%%]$~ ~$[But through a 
natural infirmity of the flesh%%lst%% which I will explain to you in a 
moment%%lst%% we incline to overlook this fact%%per%%]$~ ~$[There are really four 
dimensions%%lst%% three which we call the three planes of Space%%lst%% ]^[ a 
fourth%%lst%% Time%%per%%]$~ ~$[There is%%lst%% however%%lst%% a tendency to draw an unreal 
distinction between the former three dimensions ]^[ the latter%%lst%% 
%%cmp_b%% it happens that our consciousness moves intermittently in 
one direction along the latter from the beginning to the end of 
our lives%%per%%%%sqt%% 
`That,%%sqt%% said a very young man%%lst%% making spasmodic efforts to 
relight his cigar over the lamp%%scn%% `that %%per%% %%per%% %%per%% very clear indeed%%per%%%%sqt%% 
`Now%%lst%% it is very remarkable that this is ]s[ extensively 
overlooked,%%sqt%% continued the Time Traveller%%lst%% with a slight 
accession of cheerfulness%%per%% `Really this is what is meant by the 
Fourth Dimension%%lst%% though some people who talk about the Fourth 
Dimension do ]n[ know they mean it%%per%%]$~ ~$[It is only another way of 
looking at Time%%per%%]$~ ~$[THERE IS NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN TIME AND ANY OF 
THE THREE DIMENSIONS OF SPACE EXCEPT THAT OUR CONSCIOUSNESS MOVES 
ALONG IT%%per%%]$~ ~$[But some foolish people have got hold of the wrong 
side of that idea%%per%%]$~ ~$[You have all heard what they have to say 
about this Fourth Dimension?%%sqt%% 
`_I_ have not,%%sqt%% said the Provincial Mayor%%per%% 
`It is simply this%%per%%]$~ ~$[That Space%%lst%% as our mathematicians have it%%lst%% 
is spoken of as having three dimensions%%lst%% which one may call 
Length%%lst%% Breadth%%lst%% ]^[ Thickness%%lst%% ]^[ is always definable by 
reference to three planes%%lst%% each at right angles to the others%%per%%]$~ 
~$[But some philosophical people have been asking why THREE 
dimensions particularly%%dsh%%%%dsh%%why ]n[ another direction at right 
angles to the other three?%%dsh%%%%dsh%%and have even tried to construct a 
Four%%dsh%%Dimension geometry%%per%%]$~ ~$[Professor Simon Newcomb was expounding 
this to the New York Mathematical Society only a month ]v[ ]s[ ago%%per%%]$~ 
~$[You know how on a flat surface%%lst%% which has only two dimensions%%lst%% 
we can represent a figure of a three%%dsh%%dimensional solid%%lst%% ]^[ 
similarly they think that by models of thee dimensions they could 
represent one of four%%dsh%%%%dsh%%if they could master the perspective of 
the thing%%per%%]$~ ~$[See?%%sqt%% 
`I think so,%%sqt%% murmured the Provincial Mayor%%scn%% and%%lst%% knitting his 
brows%%lst%% he lapsed into an introspective state%%lst%% his lips moving as 
one who repeats mystic words%%per%% `Yes%%lst%% I think I see it now,%%sqt%% he 
said after some time%%lst%% brightening in a quite transitory manner%%per%% 
`Well%%lst%% I do ]n[ mind telling you I have been at work upon this 
geometry of Four Dimensions ]f[ some time%%per%%]$~ ~$[Some of my results 
are curious%%per%%]$~ ~$[For instance%%lst%% here is a portrait of a man at eight 
years old%%lst%% another at fifteen%%lst%% another at seventeen%%lst%% another at 
twenty%%dsh%%three%%lst%% ]^[ ]s[ on%%per%%]$~ ~$[All these are evidently sections%%lst%% as it 
were%%lst%% Three%%dsh%%Dimensional representations of his Four%%dsh%%Dimensioned 
being%%lst%% which is a fixed ]^[ unalterable thing%%per%% 
`Scientific people,%%sqt%% proceeded the Time Traveller%%lst%% after the 
pause required ]f[ the proper assimilation of this%%lst%% `know very 
well that Time is only a kind of Space%%per%%]$~ ~$[Here is a popular 
scientific diagram%%lst%% a weather record%%per%%]$~ ~$[This line I trace with my 
finger shows the movement of the barometer%%per%%]$~ ~$[Yesterday it was ]s[ 
high%%lst%% yesterday night it fell%%lst%% %%cmp_t%% this morning it rose again%%lst%% 
]^[ ]s[ gently upward to here%%per%%]$~ ~$[Surely the mercury did ]n[ trace 
this line in any of the dimensions of Space generally recognized%%qsn%%]$~ 
~$[But certainly it traced such a line%%lst%% ]^[ that line%%lst%% %%cmp_tf%%%%lst%% 
we must conclude was along the Time%%dsh%%Dimension%%per%%%%sqt%% 
`But,%%sqt%% said the Medical Man%%lst%% staring hard at a coal in the 
fire%%lst%% `if Time is really only a fourth dimension of Space%%lst%% why is 
it%%lst%% ]^[ why has it always been%%lst%% regarded as something different%%qsn%%]$~ 
~$[And why cannot we move in Time as we move about in the other 
dimensions of Space?%%sqt%% 
The Time Traveller smiled%%per%% `Are you sure we can move freely in 
Space%%qsn%%]$~ ~$[Right ]^[ left we can go%%lst%% backward ]^[ forward freely 
enough%%lst%% ]^[ men always have done so%%per%%]$~ ~$[I admit we move freely in 
two dimensions%%per%%]$~ ~$[But how about up ]^[ down%%qsn%%]$~ ~$[Gravitation limits 
us there%%per%%%%sqt%% 
`Not exactly,%%sqt%% said the Medical Man%%per%% `There are balloons%%per%%%%sqt%% 
`But before the balloons%%lst%% save ]f[ spasmodic jumping ]^[ the 
inequalities of the surface%%lst%% man had no freedom of vertical 
movement%%per%%%%sqt%% `Still they could move a little up ]^[ down,%%sqt%% said 
the Medical Man%%per%% 
`Easier%%lst%% far easier down %%cmp_ta%% up%%per%%%%sqt%% 
`And you cannot move at all in Time%%lst%% you cannot get away from 
the present moment%%per%%%%sqt%% 
`My dear sir%%lst%% that is just where you are wrong%%per%%]$~ ~$[That is just 
where the whole world has gone wrong%%per%%]$~ ~$[We are always getting away 
from the present movement%%per%%]$~ ~$[Our mental existences%%lst%% which are 
immaterial ]^[ have no dimensions%%lst%% are passing along the 
Time%%dsh%%Dimension with a uniform velocity from the cradle to the 
grave%%per%%]$~ ~$[Just as we should travel DOWN %%cmp_if%% we began our existence 
fifty miles above the earth%%sqt%%s surface%%per%%%%sqt%% 
`But the great difficulty is this,%%sqt%% interrupted the 
Psychologist%%per%% `You CAN move about in all directions of Space%%lst%% 
]b[ you cannot move about in Time%%per%%%%sqt%% 
`That is the germ of my great discovery%%per%%]$~ ~$[But you are wrong to 
say that we cannot move about in Time%%per%%]$~ ~$[For instance%%lst%% %%cmp_if%% I am 
recalling an incident very vividly I go back to the instant of 
its occurrence%%cln%% I become absent%%dsh%%minded%%lst%% as you say%%per%%]$~ ~$[I jump back 
]f[ a moment%%per%%]$~ ~$[Of course we have no means of staying back ]f[ any 
length of Time%%lst%% any more %%cmp_ta%% a savage ]v[ an animal has of 
staying six feet above the ground%%per%%]$~ ~$[But a civilized man is better 
off %%cmp_ta%% the savage in this respect%%per%%]$~ ~$[He can go up against 
gravitation in a balloon%%lst%% ]^[ why should he ]n[ hope that 
ultimately he may be able to stop ]v[ accelerate his drift along 
the Time%%dsh%%Dimension%%lst%% ]v[ even turn about ]^[ travel the other way?%%sqt%% 
`Oh%%lst%% THIS,%%sqt%% began Filby%%lst%% `is all%%dsh%%%%dsh%%%%sqt%% 
`Why not?%%sqt%% said the Time Traveller%%per%% 
`It%%sqt%%s against reason,%%sqt%% said Filby%%per%% 
`What reason?%%sqt%% said the Time Traveller%%per%% 
`You can show black is white by argument,%%sqt%% said Filby%%lst%% `but you 
will never convince me%%per%%%%sqt%% 
`Possibly not,%%sqt%% said the Time Traveller%%per%% `But now you begin to 
see the object of my investigations into the geometry of Four 
Dimensions%%per%%]$~ ~$[Long ago I had a vague inkling of a machine%%dsh%%%%dsh%%%%sqt%% 
`To travel through Time!%%sqt%% exclaimed the Very Young Man%%per%% 
`That shall travel indifferently in any direction of Space ]^[ 
Time%%lst%% as the driver determines%%per%%%%sqt%% 
Filby contented himself with laughter%%per%% 
`But I have experimental verification,%%sqt%% said the Time 
Traveller%%per%% 
`It would be remarkably convenient ]f[ the historian,%%sqt%% the 
Psychologist suggested%%per%% `One might travel back ]^[ verify the 
accepted account of the Battle of Hastings%%lst%% ]f[ instance!%%sqt%% 
`Don%%sqt%%t you think you would attract attention?%%sqt%% said the Medical 
Man%%per%% `Our ancestors had no great tolerance ]f[ anachronisms%%per%%%%sqt%% 
`One might get one%%sqt%%s Greek from the very lips of Homer ]^[ 
Plato,%%sqt%% the Very Young Man thought%%per%% 
`In which case they would certainly plough you ]f[ the 
Little%%dsh%%go%%per%%]$~ ~$[The German scholars have improved Greek ]s[ much%%per%%%%sqt%%

`To discover a society,%%sqt%% said I%%lst%% `erected on a strictly

`Of all the wild extravagant theories!%%sqt%% began the Psychologist%%per%% 
`Yes%%lst%% ]s[ it seemed to me%%lst%% ]^[ ]s[ I never talked of it until%%dsh%%%%dsh%%%%sqt%% 
`Experimental verification!%%sqt%% cried I%%per%% `You are going to verify

`The experiment!%%sqt%% cried Filby%%lst%% who was getting brain%%dsh%%weary%%per%% 
`Let%%sqt%%s see your experiment anyhow,%%sqt%% said the Psychologist%%lst%% 
`though it%%sqt%%s all humbug%%lst%% you know%%per%%%%sqt%% 
The Time Traveller smiled round at us%%per%%]$~ ~$[Then%%lst%% still smiling 
faintly%%lst%% ]^[ with his hands deep in his trousers pockets%%lst%% he 
walked slowly out of the room%%lst%% ]^[ we heard his slippers 
shuffling down the long passage to his laboratory%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The Psychologist looked at us%%per%% `I wonder what he%%sqt%%s got?%%sqt%%

~$[The thing the Time Traveller held in his hand was a glittering

octagonal tables that were scattered about the room%%lst%% ]^[ set it 
in front of the fire%%lst%% with two legs on the hearthrug%%per%%]$~ ~$[On this 
table he placed the mechanism%%per%%]$~ ~$[Then he drew up a chair%%lst%% ]^[ sat 
down%%per%%]$~ ~$[The only other object on the table was a small shaded 
lamp%%lst%% the bright light of which fell upon the model%%per%%]$~ ~$[There were 
also perhaps a dozen candles about%%lst%% two in brass candlesticks

him in profile from the right%%lst%% the Psychologist from the left%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The Very Young Man stood behind the Psychologist%%per%%]$~ ~$[We were all on 
the alert%%per%%]$~ ~$[It appears incredible to me that any kind of trick%%lst%% 
however subtly conceived ]^[ however adroitly done%%lst%% could have 
been played upon us under these conditions%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The Time Traveller looked at us%%lst%% ]^[ %%cmp_t%% at the mechanism%%per%% 
`Well?%%sqt%% said the Psychologist%%per%% 
`This little affair,%%sqt%% said the Time Traveller%%lst%% resting his

~$[The Psychologist recovered from his stupor%%lst%% ]^[ suddenly looked
