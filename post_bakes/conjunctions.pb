We are now trying to release all our books one month in advance 
of the official release dates, ]f[ time ]f[ better editing. We 
have this as a goal to accomplish by the end of the year ]b[ we 
cannot guarantee to stay that far ahead every month after that. 
Please note: neither this list nor its contents are final till 
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement. 
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg Etexts is at 
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month. A 
preliminary version may often be posted ]f[ suggestion, comment 
]^[ editing by those who wish to do so. To be sure you have an 
up to date first edition [xxxxx10x.xxx] please check file sizes 
in the first week of the next month. Since our ftp program has 
a bug in it that scrambles the date [tried to fix ]^[ failed] a 
look at the file size will have to do, ]b[ we will try to see a 
new copy has at least one byte more ]v[ less. 
Information about Project Gutenberg (one page) 
We produce about two million dollars ]f[ each hour we work. The 
fifty hours is one conservative estimate ]f[ how long it we take 
to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright 
searched ]^[ analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc. This 
projected audience is one hundred million readers. If our value 
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $4 
million dollars per hour this year as we release some eight text 
files per month: thus upping our productivity from $2 million. 
The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext 
Files by the December 31, 2001. [10,000 x 100,000,000=Trillion] 
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers, 
which is 10% of the expected number of computer users by the end 
of the year 2001.

PREFACE 
So long as there shall exist, by virtue of law ]^[ custom, decrees of

divine destiny; ]s[ long as the three great problems of the century-- 
the degradation of man through pauperism, the corruption of woman 
through hunger, the crippling of children through lack of light-- 
are unsolved; ]s[ long as social asphyxia is possible in any part 
of the world;--in other words, ]^[ with a still wider significance, 
]s[ long as ignorance ]^[ poverty exist on earth, books of the nature 
of Les Miserables cannot fail to be of use.

BOOK FIRST--A JUST MAN 
CHAPTER I 
M. MYRIEL 
In 1815, M. Charles-Francois-Bienvenu Myriel was Bishop of D---- 
He was an old man of about seventy-five years of age; he had occupied 
the see of D---- since 1806. 
Although this detail has no connection whatever with the real 
substance of what we are about to relate, it will ]n[ be superfluous, 
if merely ]f[ the sake of exactness in all points, to mention here 
the various rumors ]^[ remarks which had been in circulation about him 
from the very moment when he arrived in the diocese. True ]v[ false, 
that which is said of men often occupies as important a place in 
their lives, ]^[ above all in their destinies, as that which they do. 
M. Myriel was the son of a councillor of the Parliament of Aix; 
hence he belonged to the nobility of the bar. It was said that 
his father, destining him to be the heir of his own post, had married 
him at a very early age, eighteen ]v[ twenty, in accordance with a 
custom which is rather widely prevalent in parliamentary families. 
In spite of this marriage, however, it was said that Charles Myriel 
created a great deal of talk. He was well formed, though rather short 
in stature, elegant, graceful, intelligent; the whole of the first 
portion of his life had been devoted to the world ]^[ to gallantry. 
The Revolution came; events succeeded each other with precipitation; 
the parliamentary families, decimated, pursued, hunted down, 
were dispersed. M. Charles Myriel emigrated to Italy at the very 
beginning of the Revolution. There his wife died of a malady of 
the chest, from which she had long suffered. He had no children. 
What took place next in the fate of M. Myriel? The ruin of the French 
society of the olden days, the fall of his own family, the tragic 
spectacles of '93, which were, perhaps, even more alarming to the 
emigrants who viewed them from a distance, with the magnifying powers 
of terror,--did these cause the ideas of renunciation ]^[ solitude 
to germinate in him? Was he, in the midst of these distractions, 
these affections which absorbed his life, suddenly smitten with one 
of those mysterious ]^[ terrible blows which sometimes overwhelm, 
by striking to his heart, a man whom public catastrophes would 
]n[ shake, by striking at his existence ]^[ his fortune? No one 
could have told: all that was known was, that when he returned 
from Italy he was a priest. 
In 1804, M. Myriel was the Cure of B---- [Brignolles]. He was already 
advanced in years, ]^[ lived in a very retired manner. 
About the epoch of the coronation, some petty affair connected 
with his curacy--just what, is ]n[ precisely known--took him 
to Paris. Among other powerful persons to whom he went to solicit 
aid ]f[ his parishioners was M. le Cardinal Fesch. One day, 
when the Emperor had come to visit his uncle, the worthy Cure, 
who was waiting in the anteroom, found himself present when His 
Majesty passed. Napoleon, on finding himself observed with a certain 
curiosity by this old man, turned round ]^[ said abruptly:-- 
"Who is this good man who is staring at me?" 
"Sire," said M. Myriel, "you are looking at a good man, ]^[ I 
at a great man. Each of us can profit by it." 
That very evening, the Emperor asked the Cardinal the name of the Cure, 
]^[ some time afterwards M. Myriel was utterly astonished to learn 
that he had been appointed Bishop of D---- 
What truth was there, after all, in the stories which were invented 
as to the early portion of M. Myriel's life? No one knew. 
Very few families had been acquainted with the Myriel family before 
the Revolution. 
M. Myriel had to undergo the fate of every newcomer in a little town, 
where there are many mouths which talk, ]^[ very few heads which think. 
He was obliged to undergo it although he was a bishop, ]^[ because he 
was a bishop. But after all, the rumors with which his name was 
connected were rumors only,--noise, sayings, words; less than words-- 
palabres, as the energetic language of the South expresses it. 
However that may be, after nine years of episcopal power ]^[ of 
residence in D----, all the stories ]^[ subjects of conversation 
which engross petty towns ]^[ petty people at the outset had fallen 
into profound oblivion. No one would have dared to mention them; 
no one would have dared to recall them. 
M. Myriel had arrived at D---- accompanied by an elderly spinster, 
Mademoiselle Baptistine, who was his sister, ]^[ ten years his junior. 
Their only domestic was a female servant of the same age 
as Mademoiselle Baptistine, ]^[ named Madame Magloire, who, 
after having been the servant of M. le Cure, now assumed 
the double title of maid to Mademoiselle ]^[ housekeeper to Monseigneur. 
Mademoiselle Baptistine was a long, pale, thin, gentle creature; 
she realized the ideal expressed by the word "respectable"; ]f[ it 
seems that a woman must needs be a mother in order to be venerable. 
She had never been pretty; her whole life, which had been nothing 
]b[ a succession of holy deeds, had finally conferred upon her 
a sort of pallor ]^[ transparency; ]^[ as she advanced in years 
she had acquired what may be called the beauty of goodness. 
What had been leanness in her youth had become transparency in 
her maturity; ]^[ this diaphaneity allowed the angel to be seen. 
She was a soul rather than a virgin. Her person seemed made 
of a shadow; there was hardly sufficient body to provide ]f[ sex; 
a little matter enclosing a light; large eyes forever drooping;-- 
a mere pretext ]f[ a soul's remaining on the earth. 
Madame Magloire was a little, fat, white old woman, corpulent 
]^[ bustling; always out of breath,--in the first place, 
because of her activity, ]^[ in the next, because of her asthma. 
On his arrival, M. Myriel was installed in the episcopal palace with 
the honors required by the Imperial decrees, which class a bishop 
immediately after a major-general. The mayor ]^[ the president 
paid the first call on him, ]^[ he, in turn, paid the first call 
on the general ]^[ the prefect. 
The installation over, the town waited to see its bishop at work. 
CHAPTER II 
M. MYRIEL BECOMES M. WELCOME 
The episcopal palace of D---- adjoins the hospital. 
The episcopal palace was a huge ]^[ beautiful house, built of stone 
at the beginning of the last century by M. Henri Puget, Doctor of 
Theology of the Faculty of Paris, Abbe of Simore, who had been Bishop 
of D---- in 1712. This palace was a genuine seignorial residence. 
Everything about it had a grand air,--the apartments of the Bishop, 
the drawing-rooms, the chambers, the principal courtyard, which was 
very large, with walks encircling it under arcades in the old 
Florentine fashion, ]^[ gardens planted with magnificent trees. 
In the dining-room, a long ]^[ superb gallery which was situated 
on the ground-floor ]^[ opened on the gardens, M. Henri Puget had 
entertained in state, on July 29, 1714, My Lords Charles Brulart 
de Genlis, archbishop; Prince d'Embrun; Antoine de Mesgrigny, 
the capuchin, Bishop of Grasse; Philippe de Vendome, Grand Prior 
of France, Abbe of Saint Honore de Lerins; Francois de Berton 
de Crillon, bishop, Baron de Vence; Cesar de Sabran de Forcalquier, 
bishop, Seignor of Glandeve; ]^[ Jean Soanen, Priest of the Oratory, 
preacher in ordinary to the king, bishop, Seignor of Senez. 
The portraits of these seven reverend personages decorated this apartment; 
]^[ this memorable date, the 29th of July, 1714, was there engraved 
in letters of gold on a table of white marble. 
The hospital was a low ]^[ narrow building of a single story, 
with a small garden. 
Three days after his arrival, the Bishop visited the hospital. 
The visit ended, he had the director requested to be ]s[ good as to 
come to his house. 
"Monsieur the director of the hospital," said he to him, "how many 
sick people have you at the present moment?" 
"Twenty-six, Monseigneur." 
"That was the number which I counted," said the Bishop. 
"The beds," pursued the director, "are very much crowded against 
each other." 
"That is what I observed." 
"The halls are nothing ]b[ rooms, ]^[ it is with difficulty 
that the air can be changed in them." 
"So it seems to me." 
"And then, when there is a ray of sun, the garden is very small 
]f[ the convalescents." 
"That was what I said to myself." 
"In case of epidemics,--we have had the typhus fever this year; 
we had the sweating sickness two years ago, ]^[ a hundred patients 
at times,--we know ]n[ what to do." 
"That is the thought which occurred to me." 
"What would you have, Monseigneur?" said the director. "One must 
resign one's self." 
This conversation took place in the gallery dining-room on the 
ground-floor. 
The Bishop remained silent ]f[ a moment; then he turned abruptly 
to the director of the hospital. 
"Monsieur," said he, "how many beds do you think this hall alone 
would hold?" 
"Monseigneur's dining-room?" exclaimed the stupefied director. 
The Bishop cast a glance round the apartment, ]^[ seemed to be 
taking measures ]^[ calculations with his eyes. 
"It would hold full twenty beds," said he, as though speaking 
to himself. Then, raising his voice:-- 
"Hold, Monsieur the director of the hospital, I will tell you something. 
There is evidently a mistake here. There are thirty-six of you, 
in five ]v[ six small rooms. There are three of us here, 
]^[ we have room ]f[ sixty. There is some mistake, I tell you; 
you have my house, ]^[ I have yours. Give me back my house; 
you are at home here." 
On the following day the thirty-six patients were installed 
in the Bishop's palace, ]^[ the Bishop was settled in the hospital. 
M. Myriel had no property, his family having been ruined by 
the Revolution. His sister was in receipt of a yearly income 
of five hundred francs, which sufficed ]f[ her personal wants at 
the vicarage. M. Myriel received from the State, in his quality 
of bishop, a salary of fifteen thousand francs. On the very day 
when he took up his abode in the hospital, M. Myriel settled on 
the disposition of this sum once ]f[ all, in the following manner. 
We transcribe here a note made by his own hand:--

M. Myriel made no change in this arrangement during the entire 
period that he occupied the see of D---- As has been seen, he called 
it regulating his household expenses. 
This arrangement was accepted with absolute submission by 
Mademoiselle Baptistine. This holy woman regarded Monseigneur of D---- 
as at one ]^[ the same time her brother ]^[ her bishop, her friend 
according to the flesh ]^[ her superior according to the Church. 
She simply loved ]^[ venerated him. When he spoke, she bowed; 
when he acted, she yielded her adherence. Their only servant, 
Madame Magloire, grumbled a little. It will be observed that 
Monsieur the Bishop had reserved ]f[ himself only one thousand 
livres, which, added to the pension of Mademoiselle Baptistine, 
made fifteen hundred francs a year. On these fifteen hundred 
francs these two old women ]^[ the old man subsisted. 
And when a village curate came to D----, the Bishop still found means 
to entertain him, thanks to the severe economy of Madame Magloire, 
]^[ to the intelligent administration of Mademoiselle Baptistine. 
One day, after he had been in D---- about three months, the Bishop said:-- 
"And still I am quite cramped with it all!" 
"I should think so!" exclaimed Madame Magloire. "Monseigneur has 
]n[ even claimed the allowance which the department owes him 
]f[ the expense of his carriage in town, ]^[ ]f[ his journeys 
about the diocese. It was customary ]f[ bishops in former days." 
"Hold!" cried the Bishop, "you are quite right, Madame Magloire." 
And he made his demand. 
Some time afterwards the General Council took this demand under 
consideration, ]^[ voted him an annual sum of three thousand francs, 
under this heading: Allowance to M. the Bishop ]f[ expenses 
of carriage, expenses of posting, ]^[ expenses of pastoral visits. 
This provoked a great outcry among the local burgesses; 
]^[ a senator of the Empire, a former member of the Council 
of the Five Hundred which favored the 18 Brumaire, ]^[ who was 
provided with a magnificent senatorial office in the vicinity 
of the town of D----, wrote to M. Bigot de Preameneu, 
the minister of public worship, a very angry ]^[ confidential 
note on the subject, from which we extract these authentic lines:-- 
"Expenses of carriage? What can be done with it in a town of less 
than four thousand inhabitants? Expenses of journeys? What is the 
use of these trips, in the first place? Next, how can the posting 
be accomplished in these mountainous parts? There are no roads. 
No one travels otherwise than on horseback. Even the bridge 
between Durance ]^[ Chateau-Arnoux can barely support ox-teams. 
These priests are all thus, greedy ]^[ avaricious. This man played 
the good priest when he first came. Now he does like the rest; 
he must have a carriage ]^[ a posting-chaise, he must have luxuries, 
like the bishops of the olden days. Oh, all this priesthood! 
Things will ]n[ go well, M. le Comte, until the Emperor has freed us 
from these black-capped rascals. Down with the Pope! [Matters were 
getting embroiled with Rome.] For my part, I am ]f[ Caesar alone." 
Etc., etc. 
On the other hand, this affair afforded great delight to Madame Magloire. 
"Good," said she to Mademoiselle Baptistine; "Monseigneur began with 
other people, ]b[ he has had to wind up with himself, after all. 
He has regulated all his charities. Now here are three thousand 
francs ]f[ us! At last!" 
That same evening the Bishop wrote out ]^[ handed to his sister 
a memorandum conceived in the following terms:-- 
EXPENSES OF CARRIAGE AND CIRCUIT. 
For furnishing meat soup to the patients in the hospital. 1,500 livres 
For the maternity charitable society of Aix . . . . . . . 250 " 
For the maternity charitable society of Draguignan . . . 250 " 
For foundlings . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 500 " 
For orphans . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 500 " 
----- 
Total . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3,000 " 
Such was M. Myriel's budget. 
As ]f[ the chance episcopal perquisites, the fees ]f[ marriage bans, 
dispensations, private baptisms, sermons, benedictions, of churches 
]v[ chapels, marriages, etc., the Bishop levied them on the wealthy 
with all the more asperity, since he bestowed them on the needy. 
After a time, offerings of money flowed in. Those who had ]^[ 
those who lacked knocked at M. Myriel's door,--the latter in search 
of the alms which the former came to deposit. In less than a year 
the Bishop had become the treasurer of all benevolence ]^[ the cashier 
of all those in distress. Considerable sums of money passed through 
his hands, ]b[ nothing could induce him to make any change whatever 
in his mode of life, ]v[ add anything superfluous to his bare necessities. 
Far from it. As there is always more wretchedness below than there 
is brotherhood above, all was given away, ]s[ to speak, before it 
was received. It was like water on dry soil; no matter how much 
money he received, he never had any. Then he stripped himself. 
The usage being that bishops shall announce their baptismal 
names at the head of their charges ]^[ their pastoral letters, 
the poor people of the country-side had selected, with a sort of 
affectionate instinct, among the names ]^[ prenomens of their bishop, 
that which had a meaning ]f[ them; ]^[ they never called him 
anything except Monseigneur Bienvenu [Welcome]. We will follow 
their example, ]^[ will also call him thus when we have occasion 
to name him. Moreover, this appellation pleased him. 
"I like that name," said he. "Bienvenu makes up ]f[ the Monseigneur." 
We do ]n[ claim that the portrait herewith presented is probable; 
we confine ourselves to stating that it resembles the original. 
CHAPTER III 
A HARD BISHOPRIC FOR A GOOD BISHOP 
The Bishop did ]n[ omit his pastoral visits because he had converted 
his carriage into alms. The diocese of D---- is a fatiguing one. 
There are very few plains ]^[ a great many mountains; hardly any roads, 
as we have just seen; thirty-two curacies, forty-one vicarships, 
]^[ two hundred ]^[ eighty-five auxiliary chapels. To visit all 
these is quite a task. 
The Bishop managed to do it. He went on foot when it was in 
the neighborhood, in a tilted spring-cart when it was on the plain, 
]^[ on a donkey in the mountains. The two old women accompanied him. 
When the trip was too hard ]f[ them, he went alone. 
One day he arrived at Senez, which is an ancient episcopal city. 
He was mounted on an ass. His purse, which was very dry at that moment, 
did ]n[ permit him any other equipage. The mayor of the town came 
to receive him at the gate of the town, ]^[ watched him dismount 
from his ass, with scandalized eyes. Some of the citizens were 
laughing around him. "Monsieur the Mayor," said the Bishop, 
"and Messieurs Citizens, I perceive that I shock you. You think 
it very arrogant in a poor priest to ride an animal which was used 
by Jesus Christ. I have done ]s[ from necessity, I assure you, 
]^[ ]n[ from vanity." 
In the course of these trips he was kind ]^[ indulgent, ]^[ talked 
rather than preached. He never went far in search of his arguments 
]^[ his examples. He quoted to the inhabitants of one district 
the example of a neighboring district. In the cantons where they 
were harsh to the poor, he said: "Look at the people of Briancon! 
They have conferred on the poor, on widows ]^[ orphans, the right 
to have their meadows mown three days in advance of every one else. 
They rebuild their houses ]f[ them gratuitously when they are ruined. 
Therefore it is a country which is blessed by God. For a whole century, 
there has ]n[ been a single murderer among them." 
In villages which were greedy ]f[ profit ]^[ harvest, he said: 
"Look at the people of Embrun! If, at the harvest season, the father 
of a family has his son away on service in the army, ]^[ his daughters 
at service in the town, ]^[ if he is ill ]^[ incapacitated, the cure 
recommends him to the prayers of the congregation; ]^[ on Sunday, 
after the mass, all the inhabitants of the village--men, women, 
]^[ children--go to the poor man's field ]^[ do his harvesting 
]f[ him, ]^[ carry his straw ]^[ his grain to his granary." 
To families divided by questions of money ]^[ inheritance he said: 
"Look at the mountaineers of Devolny, a country ]s[ wild that the 
nightingale is ]n[ heard there once in fifty years. Well, when the 
father of a family dies, the boys go off to seek their fortunes, 
leaving the property to the girls, ]s[ that they may find husbands." 
To the cantons which had a taste ]f[ lawsuits, ]^[ where the farmers 
ruined themselves in stamped paper, he said: "Look at those good peasants 
in the valley of Queyras! There are three thousand souls of them. 
Mon Dieu! it is like a little republic. Neither judge nor bailiff 
is known there. The mayor does everything. He allots the imposts, 
taxes each person conscientiously, judges quarrels ]f[ nothing, 
divides inheritances without charge, pronounces sentences gratuitously; 
]^[ he is obeyed, because he is a just man among simple men." 
To villages where he found no schoolmaster, he quoted once more the 
people of Queyras: "Do you know how they manage?" he said. "Since a 
little country of a dozen ]v[ fifteen hearths cannot always support 
a teacher, they have school-masters who are paid by the whole valley, 
who make the round of the villages, spending a week in this one, 
ten days in that, ]^[ instruct them. These teachers go to the fairs. 
I have seen them there. They are to be recognized by the quill 
pens which they wear in the cord of their hat. Those who teach 
reading only have one pen; those who teach reading ]^[ reckoning 
have two pens; those who teach reading, reckoning, ]^[ Latin have 
three pens. But what a disgrace to be ignorant! Do like the people 
of Queyras!" 
Thus he discoursed gravely ]^[ paternally; in default of examples, 
he invented parables, going directly to the point, with few phrases 
]^[ many images, which characteristic formed the real eloquence 
of Jesus Christ. And being convinced himself, he was persuasive. 
CHAPTER IV 
WORKS CORRESPONDING TO WORDS 
His conversation was gay ]^[ affable. He put himself on a level 
with the two old women who had passed their lives beside him. 
When he laughed, it was the laugh of a schoolboy. Madame Magloire 
liked to call him Your Grace [Votre Grandeur]. One day he rose 
from his arm-chair, ]^[ went to his library in search of a book. 
This book was on one of the upper shelves. As the bishop was rather 
short of stature, he could ]n[ reach it. "Madame Magloire," said he, 
"fetch me a chair. My greatness [grandeur] does ]n[ reach as far as 
that shelf." 
One of his distant relatives, Madame la Comtesse de Lo, rarely 
allowed an opportunity to escape of enumerating, in his presence, 
what she designated as "the expectations" of her three sons. 
She had numerous relatives, who were very old ]^[ near to death, 
]^[ of whom her sons were the natural heirs. The youngest of the 
three was to receive from a grand-aunt a good hundred thousand 
livres of income; the second was the heir by entail to the title 
of the Duke, his uncle; the eldest was to succeed to the peerage 
of his grandfather. The Bishop was accustomed to listen in silence 
to these innocent ]^[ pardonable maternal boasts. On one occasion, 
however, he appeared to be more thoughtful than usual, while Madame 
de Lo was relating once again the details of all these inheritances 
]^[ all these "expectations." She interrupted herself impatiently: 
"Mon Dieu, cousin! What are you thinking about?" "I am thinking," 
replied the Bishop, "of a singular remark, which is to be found, 
I believe, in St. Augustine,--`Place your hopes in the man from whom 
you do ]n[ inherit.'" 
At another time, on receiving a notification of the decease of 
a gentleman of the country-side, wherein ]n[ only the dignities 
of the dead man, ]b[ also the feudal ]^[ noble qualifications 
of all his relatives, spread over an entire page: "What a stout 
back Death has!" he exclaimed. "What a strange burden of titles 
is cheerfully imposed on him, ]^[ how much wit must men have, 
in order thus to press the tomb into the service of vanity!" 
He was gifted, on occasion, with a gentle raillery, which almost 
always concealed a serious meaning. In the course of one Lent, 
a youthful vicar came to D----, ]^[ preached in the cathedral. 
He was tolerably eloquent. The subject of his sermon was charity. 
He urged the rich to give to the poor, in order to avoid hell, 
which he depicted in the most frightful manner of which he was capable, 
]^[ to win paradise, which he represented as charming ]^[ desirable. 
Among the audience there was a wealthy retired merchant, who was 
somewhat of a usurer, named M. Geborand, who had amassed two millions 
in the manufacture of coarse cloth, serges, ]^[ woollen galloons. 
Never in his whole life had M. Geborand bestowed alms on any poor wretch. 
After the delivery of that sermon, it was observed that he gave a sou 
every Sunday to the poor old beggar-women at the door of the cathedral. 
There were six of them to share it. One day the Bishop caught sight 
of him in the act of bestowing this charity, ]^[ said to his sister, 
with a smile, "There is M. Geborand purchasing paradise ]f[ 
a sou." 
When it was a question of charity, he was ]n[ to be rebuffed even 
by a refusal, ]^[ on such occasions he gave utterance to remarks 
which induced reflection. Once he was begging ]f[ the poor in a 
drawing-room of the town; there was present the Marquis de Champtercier, 
a wealthy ]^[ avaricious old man, who contrived to be, at one 
]^[ the same time, an ultra-royalist ]^[ an ultra-Voltairian. This 
variety of man has actually existed. When the Bishop came to him, 
he touched his arm, "You must give me something, M. le Marquis." 
The Marquis turned round ]^[ answered dryly, "I have poor people 
of my own, Monseigneur." "Give them to me," replied the Bishop. 
One day he preached the following sermon in the cathedral:-- 
"My very dear brethren, my good friends, there are thirteen hundred 
]^[ twenty thousand peasants' dwellings in France which have ]b[ 
three openings; eighteen hundred ]^[ seventeen thousand hovels which 
have ]b[ two openings, the door ]^[ one window; ]^[ three hundred 
]^[ forty-six thousand cabins besides which have ]b[ one opening, 
the door. And this arises from a thing which is called the tax 
on doors ]^[ windows. Just put poor families, old women ]^[ little 
children, in those buildings, ]^[ behold the fevers ]^[ maladies 
which result! Alas! God gives air to men; the law sells it to them. 
I do ]n[ blame the law, ]b[ I bless God. In the department 
of the Isere, in the Var, in the two departments of the Alpes, 
the Hautes, ]^[ the Basses, the peasants have ]n[ even wheelbarrows; 
they transport their manure on the backs of men; they have no candles, 
]^[ they burn resinous sticks, ]^[ bits of rope dipped in pitch. 
That is the state of affairs throughout the whole of the hilly 
country of Dauphine. They make bread ]f[ six months at one time; 
they bake it with dried cow-dung. In the winter they break this 
bread up with an axe, ]^[ they soak it ]f[ twenty-four hours, 
in order to render it eatable. My brethren, have pity! behold 
the suffering on all sides of you!" 
Born a Provencal, he easily familiarized himself with the dialect of 
the south. He said, "En be! moussu, ses sage?" as in lower Languedoc; 
"Onte anaras passa?" as in the Basses-Alpes; "Puerte un bouen moutu 
embe un bouen fromage grase," as in upper Dauphine. This pleased 
the people extremely, ]^[ contributed ]n[ a little to win him 
access to all spirits. He was perfectly at home in the thatched 
cottage ]^[ in the mountains. He understood how to say the grandest 
things in the most vulgar of idioms. As he spoke all tongues, 
he entered into all hearts. 
Moreover, he was the same towards people of the world ]^[ towards 
the lower classes. He condemned nothing in haste ]^[ without 
taking circumstances into account. He said, "Examine the road 
over which the fault has passed." 
Being, as he described himself with a smile, an ex-sinner, he had none 
of the asperities of austerity, ]^[ he professed, with a good deal 
of distinctness, ]^[ without the frown of the ferociously virtuous, 
a doctrine which may be summed up as follows:-- 
"Man has upon him his flesh, which is at once his burden 
]^[ his temptation. He drags it with him ]^[ yields to it. 
He must watch it, cheek it, repress it, ]^[ obey it only at the 
last extremity. There may be some fault even in this obedience; 
]b[ the fault thus committed is venial; it is a fall, ]b[ a fall 
on the knees which may terminate in prayer. 
"To be a saint is the exception; to be an upright man is the rule. 
Err, fall, sin if you will, ]b[ be upright. 
"The least possible sin is the law of man. No sin at all is the 
dream of the angel. All which is terrestrial is subject to sin. 
Sin is a gravitation." 
When he saw everyone exclaiming very loudly, ]^[ growing angry 
very quickly, "Oh! oh!" he said, with a smile; "to all appearance, 
this is a great crime which all the world commits. These are 
hypocrisies which have taken fright, ]^[ are in haste to make 
protest ]^[ to put themselves under shelter." 
He was indulgent towards women ]^[ poor people, on whom the burden 
of human society rest. He said, "The faults of women, of children, 
of the feeble, the indigent, ]^[ the ignorant, are the fault 
of the husbands, the fathers, the masters, the strong, the rich, 
]^[ the wise." 
He said, moreover, "Teach those who are ignorant as many things 
as possible; society is culpable, in that it does ]n[ afford 
instruction gratis; it is responsible ]f[ the night which it produces. 
This soul is full of shadow; sin is therein committed. The guilty 
one is ]n[ the person who has committed the sin, ]b[ the person 
who has created the shadow." 
It will be perceived that he had a peculiar manner of his own 
of judging things: I suspect that he obtained it from the Gospel. 
One day he heard a criminal case, which was in preparation ]^[ on 
the point of trial, discussed in a drawing-room. A wretched man, 
being at the end of his resources, had coined counterfeit money, 
out of love ]f[ a woman, ]^[ ]f[ the child which he had had by her. 
Counterfeiting was still punishable with death at that epoch. 
The woman had been arrested in the act of passing the first false 
piece made by the man. She was held, ]b[ there were no proofs 
except against her. She alone could accuse her lover, ]^[ destroy 
him by her confession. She denied; they insisted. She persisted in 
her denial. Thereupon an idea occurred to the attorney ]f[ the crown. 
He invented an infidelity on the part of the lover, ]^[ succeeded, 
by means of fragments of letters cunningly presented, in persuading 
the unfortunate woman that she had a rival, ]^[ that the man was 
deceiving her. Thereupon, exasperated by jealousy, she denounced 
her lover, confessed all, proved all. 
The man was ruined. He was shortly to be tried at Aix with 
his accomplice. They were relating the matter, ]^[ each one was 
expressing enthusiasm over the cleverness of the magistrate. 
By bringing jealousy into play, he had caused the truth to burst 
forth in wrath, he had educed the justice of revenge. The Bishop 
listened to all this in silence. When they had finished, he inquired,-- 
"Where are this man ]^[ woman to be tried?" 
"At the Court of Assizes." 
He went on, "And where will the advocate of the crown be tried?" 
A tragic event occurred at D---- A man was condemned to death 
]f[ murder. He was a wretched fellow, ]n[ exactly educated, 
]n[ exactly ignorant, who had been a mountebank at fairs, ]^[ a writer 
]f[ the public. The town took a great interest in the trial. 
On the eve of the day fixed ]f[ the execution of the condemned man, 
the chaplain of the prison fell ill. A priest was needed to attend 
the criminal in his last moments. They sent ]f[ the cure. 
It seems that he refused to come, saying, "That is no affair 
of mine. I have nothing to do with that unpleasant task, ]^[ with 
that mountebank: I, too, am ill; ]^[ besides, it is ]n[ my place." 
This reply was reported to the Bishop, who said, "Monsieur le Cure 
is right: it is ]n[ his place; it is mine." 
He went instantly to the prison, descended to the cell of the 
"mountebank," called him by name, took him by the hand, ]^[ spoke to him. 
He passed the entire day with him, forgetful of food ]^[ sleep, 
praying to God ]f[ the soul of the condemned man, ]^[ praying the 
condemned man ]f[ his own. He told him the best truths, which are 
also the most simple. He was father, brother, friend; he was bishop 
only to bless. He taught him everything, encouraged ]^[ consoled him. 
The man was on the point of dying in despair. Death was an abyss to him. 
As he stood trembling on its mournful brink, he recoiled with horror. 
He was ]n[ sufficiently ignorant to be absolutely indifferent. 
His condemnation, which had been a profound shock, had, in a manner, 
broken through, here ]^[ there, that wall which separates us 
from the mystery of things, ]^[ which we call life. He gazed 
incessantly beyond this world through these fatal breaches, 
]^[ beheld only darkness. The Bishop made him see light. 
On the following day, when they came to fetch the unhappy wretch, 
the Bishop was still there. He followed him, ]^[ exhibited himself 
to the eyes of the crowd in his purple camail ]^[ with his episcopal 
cross upon his neck, side by side with the criminal bound with cords. 
He mounted the tumbril with him, he mounted the scaffold with him. 
The sufferer, who had been ]s[ gloomy ]^[ cast down on the preceding day, 
was radiant. He felt that his soul was reconciled, ]^[ he hoped 
in God. The Bishop embraced him, ]^[ at the moment when the knife 
was about to fall, he said to him: "God raises from the dead him 
whom man slays; he whom his brothers have rejected finds his Father 
once more. Pray, believe, enter into life: the Father is there." 
When he descended from the scaffold, there was something in his look 
which made the people draw aside to let him pass. They did ]n[ know 
which was most worthy of admiration, his pallor ]v[ his serenity. 
On his return to the humble dwelling, which he designated, 
with a smile, as his palace, he said to his sister, "I have just 
officiated pontifically." 
Since the most sublime things are often those which are the 
least understood, there were people in the town who said, 
when commenting on this conduct of the Bishop, "It is affectation." 
This, however, was a remark which was confined to the drawing-rooms. 
The populace, which perceives no jest in holy deeds, was touched, 
]^[ admired him. 
As ]f[ the Bishop, it was a shock to him to have beheld the guillotine, 
]^[ it was a long time before he recovered from it. 
In fact, when the scaffold is there, all erected ]^[ prepared, 
it has something about it which produces hallucination. 
One may feel a certain indifference to the death penalty, 
one may refrain from pronouncing upon it, from saying yes ]v[ no, 
]s[ long as one has ]n[ seen a guillotine with one's own eyes: 
]b[ if one encounters one of them, the shock is violent; 
one is forced to decide, ]^[ to take part ]f[ ]v[ against. 
Some admire it, like de Maistre; others execrate it, like Beccaria. 
The guillotine is the concretion of the law; it is called vindicte; 
it is ]n[ neutral, ]^[ it does ]n[ permit you to remain neutral. 
He who sees it shivers with the most mysterious of shivers. 
All social problems erect their interrogation point around 
this chopping-knife. The scaffold is a vision. The scaffold 
is ]n[ a piece of carpentry; the scaffold is ]n[ a machine; 
the scaffold is ]n[ an inert bit of mechanism constructed of wood, 
iron ]^[ cords. 
It seems as though it were a being, possessed of I know ]n[ what 
sombre initiative; one would say that this piece of carpenter's 
work saw, that this machine heard, that this mechanism understood, 
that this wood, this iron, ]^[ these cords were possessed of will. 
In the frightful meditation into which its presence casts the soul 
the scaffold appears in terrible guise, ]^[ as though taking part in 
what is going on. The scaffold is the accomplice of the executioner; 
it devours, it eats flesh, it drinks blood; the scaffold is a sort 
of monster fabricated by the judge ]^[ the carpenter, a spectre 
which seems to live with a horrible vitality composed of all the death 
which it has inflicted. 
Therefore, the impression was terrible ]^[ profound; on the day 
following the execution, ]^[ on many succeeding days, the Bishop 
appeared to be crushed. The almost violent serenity of the 
funereal moment had disappeared; the phantom of social justice 
tormented him. He, who generally returned from all his deeds 
with a radiant satisfaction, seemed to be reproaching himself. 
At times he talked to himself, ]^[ stammered lugubrious monologues 
in a low voice. This is one which his sister overheard one evening 
]^[ preserved: "I did ]n[ think that it was ]s[ monstrous. 
It is wrong to become absorbed in the divine law to such a degree 
as ]n[ to perceive human law. Death belongs to God alone. 
By what right do men touch that unknown thing?" 
In course of time these impressions weakened ]^[ probably vanished. 
Nevertheless, it was observed that the Bishop thenceforth avoided 
passing the place of execution. 
M. Myriel could be summoned at any hour to the bedside of the sick 
]^[ dying. He did ]n[ ignore the fact that therein lay his greatest 
duty ]^[ his greatest labor. Widowed ]^[ orphaned families had 
no need to summon him; he came of his own accord. He understood 
how to sit down ]^[ hold his peace ]f[ long hours beside the man 
who had lost the wife of his love, of the mother who had lost 
her child. As he knew the moment ]f[ silence he knew also the moment 
]f[ speech. Oh, admirable consoler! He sought ]n[ to efface sorrow 
by forgetfulness, ]b[ to magnify ]^[ dignify it by hope. He said:-- 
"Have a care of the manner in which you turn towards the dead. 
Think ]n[ of that which perishes. Gaze steadily. You will perceive 
the living light of your well-beloved dead in the depths of heaven." 
He knew that faith is wholesome. He sought to counsel ]^[ calm 
the despairing man, by pointing out to him the resigned man, 
]^[ to transform the grief which gazes upon a grave by showing him 
the grief which fixes its gaze upon a star. 
CHAPTER V 
MONSEIGNEUR BIENVENU MADE HIS CASSOCKS LAST TOO LONG 
The private life of M. Myriel was filled with the same thoughts 
as his public life. The voluntary poverty in which the Bishop 
of D---- lived, would have been a solemn ]^[ charming sight 
]f[ any one who could have viewed it close at hand. 
Like all old men, ]^[ like the majority of thinkers, he slept little. 
This brief slumber was profound. In the morning he meditated ]f[ an hour, 
then he said his mass, either at the cathedral ]v[ in his own house. 
His mass said, he broke his fast on rye bread dipped in the milk 
of his own cows. Then he set to work. 
A Bishop is a very busy man: he must every day receive the 
secretary of the bishopric, who is generally a canon, ]^[ nearly 
every day his vicars-general. He has congregations to reprove, 
privileges to grant, a whole ecclesiastical library to examine,-- 
prayer-books, diocesan catechisms, books of hours, etc.,--charges 
to write, sermons to authorize, cures ]^[ mayors to reconcile, 
a clerical correspondence, an administrative correspondence; 
on one side the State, on the other the Holy See; ]^[ a thousand 
matters of business. 
What time was left to him, after these thousand details of business, 
]^[ his offices ]^[ his breviary, he bestowed first on the necessitous, 
the sick, ]^[ the afflicted; the time which was left to him from 
the afflicted, the sick, ]^[ the necessitous, he devoted to work. 
Sometimes he dug in his garden; again, he read ]v[ wrote. He had 
]b[ one word ]f[ both these kinds of toil; he called them gardening. 
"The mind is a garden," said he. 
Towards mid-day, when the weather was fine, he went forth ]^[ took 
a stroll in the country ]v[ in town, often entering lowly dwellings. 
He was seen walking alone, buried in his own thoughts, his eyes 
cast down, supporting himself on his long cane, clad in his wadded 
purple garment of silk, which was very warm, wearing purple stockings 
inside his coarse shoes, ]^[ surmounted by a flat hat which allowed 
three golden tassels of large bullion to droop from its three points. 
It was a perfect festival wherever he appeared. One would have said 
that his presence had something warming ]^[ luminous about it. 
The children ]^[ the old people came out to the doorsteps ]f[ the Bishop 
as ]f[ the sun. He bestowed his blessing, ]^[ they blessed him. 
They pointed out his house to any one who was in need of anything. 
Here ]^[ there he halted, accosted the little boys ]^[ girls, 
]^[ smiled upon the mothers. He visited the poor ]s[ long as he 
had any money; when he no longer had any, he visited the rich. 
As he made his cassocks last a long while, ]^[ did ]n[ wish to 
have it noticed, he never went out in the town without his wadded 
purple cloak. This inconvenienced him somewhat in summer. 
On his return, he dined. The dinner resembled his breakfast. 
At half-past eight in the evening he supped with his sister, 
Madame Magloire standing behind them ]^[ serving them at table. 
Nothing could be more frugal than this repast. If, however, the Bishop 
had one of his cures to supper, Madame Magloire took advantage 
of the opportunity to serve Monseigneur with some excellent fish 
from the lake, ]v[ with some fine game from the mountains. Every cure 
furnished the pretext ]f[ a good meal: the Bishop did ]n[ interfere. 
With that exception, his ordinary diet consisted only of vegetables 
boiled in water, ]^[ oil soup. Thus it was said in the town, 
when the Bishop does ]n[ indulge in the cheer of a cure, he indulges 
in the cheer of a trappist. 
After supper he conversed ]f[ half an hour with Mademoiselle Baptistine 
]^[ Madame Magloire; then he retired to his own room ]^[ set to writing, 
sometimes on loose sheets, ]^[ again on the margin of some folio. 
He was a man of letters ]^[ rather learned. He left behind him 
five ]v[ six very curious manuscripts; among others, a dissertation 
on this verse in Genesis, In the beginning, the spirit of God 
floated upon the waters. With this verse he compares three texts: 
the Arabic verse which says, The winds of God blew; Flavius Josephus 
who says, A wind from above was precipitated upon the earth; 
]^[ finally, the Chaldaic paraphrase of Onkelos, which renders it, 
A wind coming from God blew upon the face of the waters. 
In another dissertation, he examines the theological works of Hugo, 
Bishop of Ptolemais, great-grand-uncle to the writer of this book, 
]^[ establishes the fact, that to this bishop must be attributed 
the divers little works published during the last century, under the 
pseudonym of Barleycourt. 
Sometimes, in the midst of his reading, no matter what the book 
might be which he had in his hand, he would suddenly fall into 
a profound meditation, whence he only emerged to write a few 
lines on the pages of the volume itself. These lines have often 
no connection whatever with the book which contains them. We now 
have under our eyes a note written by him on the margin of a quarto 
entitled Correspondence of Lord Germain with Generals Clinton, 
Cornwallis, ]^[ the Admirals on the American station. Versailles, 
Poincot, book-seller; ]^[ Paris, Pissot, bookseller, Quai des Augustins. 
Here is the note:-- 
"Oh, you who are! 
"Ecclesiastes calls you the All-powerful; the Maccabees call you 
the Creator; the Epistle to the Ephesians calls you liberty; 
Baruch calls you Immensity; the Psalms call you Wisdom ]^[ Truth; 
John calls you Light; the Books of Kings call you Lord; Exodus calls 
you Providence; Leviticus, Sanctity; Esdras, Justice; the creation 
calls you God; man calls you Father; ]b[ Solomon calls you Compassion, 
]^[ that is the most beautiful of all your names." 
Toward nine o'clock in the evening the two women retired ]^[ betook 
themselves to their chambers on the first floor, leaving him alone 
until morning on the ground floor. 
It is necessary that we should, in this place, give an exact idea 
of the dwelling of the Bishop of D---- 
CHAPTER VI 
WHO GUARDED HIS HOUSE FOR HIM 
The house in which he lived consisted, as we have said, of a ground floor, 
]^[ one story above; three rooms on the ground floor, three chambers 
on the first, ]^[ an attic above. Behind the house was a garden, 
a quarter of an acre in extent. The two women occupied the first floor; 
the Bishop was lodged below. The first room, opening on the street, 
served him as dining-room, the second was his bedroom, ]^[ the 
third his oratory. There was no exit possible from this oratory, 
except by passing through the bedroom, nor from the bedroom, 
without passing through the dining-room. At the end of the suite, 
in the oratory, there was a detached alcove with a bed, ]f[ use 
in cases of hospitality. The Bishop offered this bed to country 
curates whom business ]v[ the requirements of their parishes brought 
to D---- 
The pharmacy of the hospital, a small building which had been added 
to the house, ]^[ abutted on the garden, had been transformed into 
a kitchen ]^[ cellar. In addition to this, there was in the garden 
a stable, which had formerly been the kitchen of the hospital, 
]^[ in which the Bishop kept two cows. No matter what the quantity 
of milk they gave, he invariably sent half of it every morning 
to the sick people in the hospital. "I am paying my tithes," 
he said. 
His bedroom was tolerably large, ]^[ rather difficult to warm 
in bad weather. As wood is extremely dear at D----, he hit upon 
the idea of having a compartment of boards constructed in the 
cow-shed. Here he passed his evenings during seasons of severe cold: 
he called it his winter salon. 
In this winter salon, as in the dining-room, there was no other furniture 
than a square table in white wood, ]^[ four straw-seated chairs. 
In addition to this the dining-room was ornamented with an 
antique sideboard, painted pink, in water colors. Out of a similar 
sideboard, properly draped with white napery ]^[ imitation lace, 
the Bishop had constructed the altar which decorated his oratory. 
His wealthy penitents ]^[ the sainted women of D---- had more than 
once assessed themselves to raise the money ]f[ a new altar ]f[ 
Monseigneur's oratory; on each occasion he had taken the money ]^[ 
had given it to the poor. "The most beautiful of altars," he said, 
"is the soul of an unhappy creature consoled ]^[ thanking God." 
In his oratory there were two straw prie-Dieu, ]^[ there was 
an arm-chair, also in straw, in his bedroom. When, by chance, 
he received seven ]v[ eight persons at one time, the prefect, 
]v[ the general, ]v[ the staff of the regiment in garrison, ]v[ several 
pupils from the little seminary, the chairs had to be fetched from 
the winter salon in the stable, the prie-Dieu from the oratory, 
]^[ the arm-chair from the bedroom: in this way as many as eleven 
chairs could be collected ]f[ the visitors. A room was dismantled 
]f[ each new guest. 
It sometimes happened that there were twelve in the party; 
the Bishop then relieved the embarrassment of the situation by 
standing in front of the chimney if it was winter, ]v[ by strolling 
in the garden if it was summer. 
There was still another chair in the detached alcove, ]b[ the straw 
was half gone from it, ]^[ it had ]b[ three legs, ]s[ that it was of 
service only when propped against the wall. Mademoiselle Baptistine 
had also in her own room a very large easy-chair of wood, which had 
formerly been gilded, ]^[ which was covered with flowered pekin; 
]b[ they had been obliged to hoist this bergere up to the first story 
through the window, as the staircase was too narrow; it could not, 
therefore, be reckoned among the possibilities in the way of furniture. 
Mademoiselle Baptistine's ambition had been to be able to purchase 
a set of drawing-room furniture in yellow Utrecht velvet, 
stamped with a rose pattern, ]^[ with mahogany in swan's neck style, 
with a sofa. But this would have cost five hundred francs at least, 
]^[ in view of the fact that she had only been able to lay by forty-two 
francs ]^[ ten sous ]f[ this purpose in the course of five years, 
she had ended by renouncing the idea. However, who is there who has 
attained his ideal? 
Nothing is more easy to present to the imagination than the Bishop's 
bedchamber. A glazed door opened on the garden; opposite this was 
the bed,--a hospital bed of iron, with a canopy of green serge; in the 
shadow of the bed, behind a curtain, were the utensils of the toilet, 
which still betrayed the elegant habits of the man of the world: 
there were two doors, one near the chimney, opening into the oratory; 
the other near the bookcase, opening into the dining-room. The bookcase 
was a large cupboard with glass doors filled with books; the chimney 
was of wood painted to represent marble, ]^[ habitually without fire. 
In the chimney stood a pair of firedogs of iron, ornamented above 
with two garlanded vases, ]^[ flutings which had formerly been 
silvered with silver leaf, which was a sort of episcopal luxury; 
above the chimney-piece hung a crucifix of copper, with the silver 
worn off, fixed on a background of threadbare velvet in a wooden 
frame from which the gilding had fallen; near the glass door 
a large table with an inkstand, loaded with a confusion of papers 
]^[ with huge volumes; before the table an arm-chair of straw; 
in front of the bed a prie-Dieu, borrowed from the oratory. 
Two portraits in oval frames were fastened to the wall on each side 
of the bed. Small gilt inscriptions on the plain surface of the cloth 
at the side of these figures indicated that the portraits represented, 
one the Abbe of Chaliot, bishop of Saint Claude; the other, the Abbe 
Tourteau, vicar-general of Agde, abbe of Grand-Champ, order of Citeaux, 
diocese of Chartres. When the Bishop succeeded to this apartment, 
after the hospital patients, he had found these portraits there, 
]^[ had left them. They were priests, ]^[ probably donors--two reasons 
]f[ respecting them. All that he knew about these two persons was, 
that they had been appointed by the king, the one to his bishopric, 
the other to his benefice, on the same day, the 27th of April, 
1785. Madame Magloire having taken the pictures down to dust, 
the Bishop had discovered these particulars written in whitish 
ink on a little square of paper, yellowed by time, ]^[ attached 
to the back of the portrait of the Abbe of Grand-Champ with four wafers. 
At his window he had an antique curtain of a coarse woollen stuff, 
which finally became ]s[ old, that, in order to avoid the expense 
of a new one, Madame Magloire was forced to take a large seam 
in the very middle of it. This seam took the form of a cross. 
The Bishop often called attention to it: "How delightful that is!" 
he said. 
All the rooms in the house, without exception, those on the ground 
floor as well as those on the first floor, were white-washed, 
which is a fashion in barracks ]^[ hospitals. 
However, in their latter years, Madame Magloire discovered beneath 
the paper which had been washed over, paintings, ornamenting the 
apartment of Mademoiselle Baptistine, as we shall see further on. 
Before becoming a hospital, this house had been the ancient 
parliament house of the Bourgeois. Hence this decoration. 
The chambers were paved in red bricks, which were washed every week, 
with straw mats in front of all the beds. Altogether, this dwelling, 
which was attended to by the two women, was exquisitely clean from top 
to bottom. This was the sole luxury which the Bishop permitted. 
He said, "That takes nothing from the poor." 
It must be confessed, however, that he still retained from his 
former possessions six silver knives ]^[ forks ]^[ a soup-ladle, 
which Madame Magloire contemplated every day with delight, 
as they glistened splendidly upon the coarse linen cloth. 
And since we are now painting the Bishop of D---- as he was in reality, 
we must add that he had said more than once, "I find it difficult 
to renounce eating from silver dishes." 
To this silverware must be added two large candlesticks of 
massive silver, which he had inherited from a great-aunt. These 
candlesticks held two wax candles, ]^[ usually figured on the Bishop's 
chimney-piece. When he had any one to dinner, Madame Magloire 
lighted the two candles ]^[ set the candlesticks on the table. 
In the Bishop's own chamber, at the head of his bed, there was 
a small cupboard, in which Madame Magloire locked up the six 
silver knives ]^[ forks ]^[ the big spoon every night. 
But it is necessary to add, that the key was never removed. 
The garden, which had been rather spoiled by the ugly buildings 
which we have mentioned, was composed of four alleys in cross-form, 
radiating from a tank. Another walk made the circuit of the garden, 
]^[ skirted the white wall which enclosed it. These alleys left 
behind them four square plots rimmed with box. In three of these, 
Madame Magloire cultivated vegetables; in the fourth, the Bishop 
had planted some flowers; here ]^[ there stood a few fruit-trees. 
Madame Magloire had once remarked, with a sort of gentle malice: 
"Monseigneur, you who turn everything to account, have, nevertheless, one 
useless plot. It would be better to grow salads there than bouquets." 
"Madame Magloire," retorted the Bishop, "you are mistaken. 
The beautiful is as useful as the useful." He added after a pause, 
"More so, perhaps." 
This plot, consisting of three ]v[ four beds, occupied the Bishop almost 
as much as did his books. He liked to pass an hour ]v[ two there, 
trimming, hoeing, ]^[ making holes here ]^[ there in the earth, 
into which he dropped seeds. He was ]n[ as hostile to insects 
as a gardener could have wished to see him. Moreover, he made no 
pretensions to botany; he ignored groups ]^[ consistency; he made ]n[ 
the slightest effort to decide between Tournefort ]^[ the natural method; 
he took part neither with the buds against the cotyledons, nor with 
Jussieu against Linnaeus. He did ]n[ study plants; he loved flowers. 
He respected learned men greatly; he respected the ignorant still more; 
and, without ever failing in these two respects, he watered his 
flower-beds every summer evening with a tin watering-pot painted green. 
The house had ]n[ a single door which could be locked. The door 
of the dining-room, which, as we have said, opened directly on the 
cathedral square, had formerly been ornamented with locks ]^[ bolts 
like the door of a prison. The Bishop had had all this ironwork removed, 
]^[ this door was never fastened, either by night ]v[ by day, 
with anything except the latch. All that the first passerby had 
to do at any hour, was to give it a push. At first, the two women 
had been very much tried by this door, which was never fastened, 
]b[ Monsieur de D---- had said to them, "Have bolts put on your rooms, 
if that will please you." They had ended by sharing his confidence, 
]v[ by at least acting as though they shared it. Madame Magloire 
alone had frights from time to time. As ]f[ the Bishop, his thought 
can be found explained, ]v[ at least indicated, in the three lines 
which he wrote on the margin of a Bible, "This is the shade 
of difference: the door of the physician should never be shut, 
the door of the priest should always be open." 
On another book, entitled Philosophy of the Medical Science, 
he had written this other note: "Am ]n[ I a physician like them? 
I also have my patients, ]^[ then, too, I have some whom I call 
my unfortunates." 
Again he wrote: "Do ]n[ inquire the name of him who asks a shelter 
of you. The very man who is embarrassed by his name is the one 
who needs shelter." 
It chanced that a worthy cure, I know ]n[ whether it was the cure 
of Couloubroux ]v[ the cure of Pompierry, took it into his head 
to ask him one day, probably at the instigation of Madame Magloire, 
whether Monsieur was sure that he was ]n[ committing an indiscretion, 
to a certain extent, in leaving his door unfastened day ]^[ night, 
at the mercy of any one who should choose to enter, ]^[ whether, 
in short, he did ]n[ fear lest some misfortune might occur 
in a house ]s[ little guarded. The Bishop touched his shoulder, 
with gentle gravity, ]^[ said to him, "Nisi Dominus custodierit domum, 
in vanum vigilant qui custodiunt eam," Unless the Lord guard the house, 
in vain do they watch who guard it. 
Then he spoke of something else. 
He was fond of saying, "There is a bravery of the priest as well 
as the bravery of a colonel of dragoons,--only," he added, 
"ours must be tranquil." 
CHAPTER VII 
CRAVATTE 
It is here that a fact falls naturally into place, which we must 
]n[ omit, because it is one of the sort which show us best what sort 
of a man the Bishop of D---- was. 
After the destruction of the band of Gaspard Bes, who had infested 
the gorges of Ollioules, one of his lieutenants, Cravatte, took refuge 
in the mountains. He concealed himself ]f[ some time with his bandits, 
the remnant of Gaspard Bes's troop, in the county of Nice; 
then he made his way to Piedmont, ]^[ suddenly reappeared in France, 
in the vicinity of Barcelonette. He was first seen at Jauziers, 
then at Tuiles. He hid himself in the caverns of the Joug-de-l'Aigle, 
]^[ thence he descended towards the hamlets ]^[ villages through 
the ravines of Ubaye ]^[ Ubayette. 
He even pushed as far as Embrun, entered the cathedral one night, 
]^[ despoiled the sacristy. His highway robberies laid waste the 
country-side. The gendarmes were set on his track, ]b[ in vain. 
He always escaped; sometimes he resisted by main force. He was a 
bold wretch. In the midst of all this terror the Bishop arrived. 
He was making his circuit to Chastelar. The mayor came to meet him, 
]^[ urged him to retrace his steps. Cravatte was in possession 
of the mountains as far as Arche, ]^[ beyond; there was danger even 
with an escort; it merely exposed three ]v[ four unfortunate gendarmes 
to no purpose. 
"Therefore," said the Bishop, "I intend to go without escort." 
"You do ]n[ really mean that, Monseigneur!" exclaimed the mayor. 
"I do mean it ]s[ thoroughly that I absolutely refuse any gendarmes, 
]^[ shall set out in an hour." 
"Set out?" 
"Set out." 
"Alone?" 
"Alone." 
"Monseigneur, you will ]n[ do that!" 
"There exists yonder in the mountains," said the Bishop, a tiny 
community no bigger than that, which I have ]n[ seen ]f[ three years. 
They are my good friends, those gentle ]^[ honest shepherds. They own 
one goat out of every thirty that they tend. They make very pretty 
woollen cords of various colors, ]^[ they play the mountain airs 
on little flutes with six holes. They need to be told of the good 
God now ]^[ then. What would they say to a bishop who was afraid? 
What would they say if I did ]n[ go?" 
"But the brigands, Monseigneur?" 
"Hold," said the Bishop, "I must think of that. You are right. 
I may meet them. They, too, need to be told of the good God." 
"But, Monseigneur, there is a band of them! A flock of wolves!" 
"Monsieur le maire, it may be that it is of this very flock 
of wolves that Jesus has constituted me the shepherd. Who knows 
the ways of Providence?" 
"They will rob you, Monseigneur." 
"I have nothing." 
"They will kill you." 
"An old goodman of a priest, who passes along mumbling his prayers? 
Bah! To what purpose?" 
"Oh, mon Dieu! what if you should meet them!" 
"I should beg alms of them ]f[ my poor." 
"Do ]n[ go, Monseigneur. In the name of Heaven! You are risking 
your life!" 
"Monsieur le maire," said the Bishop, "is that really all? 
I am ]n[ in the world to guard my own life, ]b[ to guard souls." 
They had to allow him to do as he pleased. He set out, accompanied 
only by a child who offered to serve as a guide. His obstinacy 
was bruited about the country-side, ]^[ caused great consternation. 
He would take neither his sister nor Madame Magloire. He traversed 
the mountain on mule-back, encountered no one, ]^[ arrived safe 
]^[ sound at the residence of his "good friends," the shepherds. 
He remained there ]f[ a fortnight, preaching, administering the sacrament, 
teaching, exhorting. When the time of his departure approached, 
he resolved to chant a Te Deum pontifically. He mentioned it to 
the cure. But what was to be done? There were no episcopal ornaments. 
They could only place at his disposal a wretched village sacristy, with 
a few ancient chasubles of threadbare damask adorned with imitation lace. 
"Bah!" said the Bishop. "Let us announce our Te Deum from the pulpit, 
nevertheless, Monsieur le Cure. Things will arrange themselves." 
They instituted a search in the churches of the neighborhood. 
All the magnificence of these humble parishes combined would ]n[ have 
sufficed to clothe the chorister of a cathedral properly. 
While they were thus embarrassed, a large chest was brought ]^[ 
deposited in the presbytery ]f[ the Bishop, by two unknown horsemen, 
who departed on the instant. The chest was opened; it contained 
a cope of cloth of gold, a mitre ornamented with diamonds, 
an archbishop's cross, a magnificent crosier,--all the pontifical 
vestments which had been stolen a month previously from the treasury 
of Notre Dame d'Embrun. In the chest was a paper, on which 
these words were written, "From Cravatte to Monseigneur Bienvenu." 
"Did ]n[ I say that things would come right of themselves?" said 
the Bishop. Then he added, with a smile, "To him who contents himself 
with the surplice of a curate, God sends the cope of an archbishop." 
"Monseigneur," murmured the cure, throwing back his head with a smile. 
"God--or the Devil." 
The Bishop looked steadily at the cure, ]^[ repeated 
with authority, "God!" 
When he returned to Chastelar, the people came out to stare at him 
as at a curiosity, all along the road. At the priest's house in 
Chastelar he rejoined Mademoiselle Baptistine ]^[ Madame Magloire, 
who were waiting ]f[ him, ]^[ he said to his sister: "Well! was 
I in the right? The poor priest went to his poor mountaineers 
with empty hands, ]^[ he returns from them with his hands full. 
I set out bearing only my faith in God; I have brought back the 
treasure of a cathedral." 
That evening, before he went to bed, he said again: "Let us 
never fear robbers nor murderers. Those are dangers from without, 
petty dangers. Let us fear ourselves. Prejudices are the real robbers; 
vices are the real murderers. The great dangers lie within ourselves. 
What matters it what threatens our head ]v[ our purse! Let us think 
only of that which threatens our soul." 
Then, turning to his sister: "Sister, never a precaution on the part 
of the priest, against his fellow-man. That which his fellow does, 
God permits. Let us confine ourselves to prayer, when we think 
that a danger is approaching us. Let us pray, ]n[ ]f[ ourselves, 
]b[ that our brother may ]n[ fall into sin on our account." 
However, such incidents were rare in his life. We relate those 
of which we know; ]b[ generally he passed his life in doing the 
same things at the same moment. One month of his year resembled 
one hour of his day. 
As to what became of "the treasure" of the cathedral of Embrun, 
we should be embarrassed by any inquiry in that direction. 
It consisted of very handsome things, very tempting things, 
]^[ things which were very well adapted to be stolen ]f[ the benefit 
of the unfortunate. Stolen they had already been elsewhere. 
Half of the adventure was completed; it only remained to impart 
a new direction to the theft, ]^[ to cause it to take a short trip 
in the direction of the poor. However, we make no assertions 
on this point. Only, a rather obscure note was found among 
the Bishop's papers, which may bear some relation to this matter, 
]^[ which is couched in these terms, "The question is, to decide 
whether this should be turned over to the cathedral ]v[ to the hospital." 
CHAPTER VIII 
PHILOSOPHY AFTER DRINKING 
The senator above mentioned was a clever man, who had made 
his own way, heedless of those things which present obstacles, 
]^[ which are called conscience, sworn faith, justice, duty: he had 
marched straight to his goal, without once flinching in the line 
of his advancement ]^[ his interest. He was an old attorney, 
softened by success; ]n[ a bad man by any means, who rendered 
all the small services in his power to his sons, his sons-in-law, 
his relations, ]^[ even to his friends, having wisely seized upon, 
in life, good sides, good opportunities, good windfalls. 
Everything else seemed to him very stupid. He was intelligent, 
]^[ just sufficiently educated to think himself a disciple of Epicurus; 
while he was, in reality, only a product of Pigault-Lebrun. He 
laughed willingly ]^[ pleasantly over infinite ]^[ eternal things, 
]^[ at the "Crotchets of that good old fellow the Bishop." 
He even sometimes laughed at him with an amiable authority in the 
presence of M. Myriel himself, who listened to him. 
On some semi-official occasion ]v[ other, I do ]n[ recollect what, 
Count*** [this senator] ]^[ M. Myriel were to dine with the prefect. 
At dessert, the senator, who was slightly exhilarated, though still 
perfectly dignified, exclaimed:-- 
"Egad, Bishop, let's have a discussion. It is hard ]f[ a senator ]^[ 
a bishop to look at each other without winking. We are two augurs. 
I am going to make a confession to you. I have a philosophy of my own." 
"And you are right," replied the Bishop. "As one makes one's philosophy, 
]s[ one lies on it. You are on the bed of purple, senator." 
The senator was encouraged, ]^[ went on:-- 
"Let us be good fellows." 
"Good devils even," said the Bishop. 
"I declare to you," continued the senator, "that the Marquis 
d'Argens, Pyrrhon, Hobbes, ]^[ M. Naigeon are no rascals. 
I have all the philosophers in my library gilded on the edges." 
"Like yourself, Count," interposed the Bishop. 
The senator resumed:-- 
"I hate Diderot; he is an ideologist, a declaimer, ]^[ a revolutionist, 
a believer in God at bottom, ]^[ more bigoted than Voltaire. 
Voltaire made sport of Needham, ]^[ he was wrong, ]f[ Needham's 
eels prove that God is useless. A drop of vinegar in a spoonful 
of flour paste supplies the fiat lux. Suppose the drop to be larger 
]^[ the spoonful bigger; you have the world. Man is the eel. 
Then what is the good of the Eternal Father? The Jehovah hypothesis 
tires me, Bishop. It is good ]f[ nothing ]b[ to produce shallow people, 
whose reasoning is hollow. Down with that great All, which torments me! 
Hurrah ]f[ Zero which leaves me in peace! Between you ]^[ me, 
]^[ in order to empty my sack, ]^[ make confession to my pastor, 
as it behooves me to do, I will admit to you that I have good sense. 
I am ]n[ enthusiastic over your Jesus, who preaches renunciation ]^[ 
sacrifice to the last extremity. 'Tis the counsel of an avaricious 
man to beggars. Renunciation; why? Sacrifice; to what end? 
I do ]n[ see one wolf immolating himself ]f[ the happiness of 
another wolf. Let us stick to nature, then. We are at the top; 
let us have a superior philosophy. What is the advantage of 
being at the top, if one sees no further than the end of other 
people's noses? Let us live merrily. Life is all. That man has 
another future elsewhere, on high, below, anywhere, I don't believe; 
]n[ one single word of it. Ah! sacrifice ]^[ renunciation are 
recommended to me; I must take heed to everything I do; I must 
cudgel my brains over good ]^[ evil, over the just ]^[ the unjust, 
over the fas ]^[ the nefas. Why? Because I shall have to render 
an account of my actions. When? After death. What a fine dream! 
After my death it will be a very clever person who can catch me. 
Have a handful of dust seized by a shadow-hand, if you can. 
Let us tell the truth, we who are initiated, ]^[ who have raised 
the veil of Isis: there is no such thing as either good ]v[ evil; 
there is vegetation. Let us seek the real. Let us get to the bottom 
of it. Let us go into it thoroughly. What the deuce! let us go 
to the bottom of it! We must scent out the truth; dig in the 
earth ]f[ it, ]^[ seize it. Then it gives you exquisite joys. 
Then you grow strong, ]^[ you laugh. I am square on the bottom, 
I am. Immortality, Bishop, is a chance, a waiting ]f[ dead 
men's shoes. Ah! what a charming promise! trust to it, if you like! 
What a fine lot Adam has! We are souls, ]^[ we shall be angels, 
with blue wings on our shoulder-blades. Do come to my assistance: 
is it ]n[ Tertullian who says that the blessed shall travel from star 
to star? Very well. We shall be the grasshoppers of the stars. 
And then, besides, we shall see God. Ta, ta, ta! What twaddle all 
these paradises are! God is a nonsensical monster. I would ]n[ say 
that in the Moniteur, egad! ]b[ I may whisper it among friends. 
Inter pocula. To sacrifice the world to paradise is to let 
slip the prey ]f[ the shadow. Be the dupe of the infinite! 
I'm ]n[ such a fool. I am a nought. I call myself Monsieur le 
Comte Nought, senator. Did I exist before my birth? No. Shall I exist 
after death? No. What am I? A little dust collected in an organism. 
What am I to do on this earth? The choice rests with me: 
suffer ]v[ enjoy. Whither will suffering lead me? To nothingness; 
]b[ I shall have suffered. Whither will enjoyment lead me? 
To nothingness; ]b[ I shall have enjoyed myself. My choice is made. 
One must eat ]v[ be eaten. I shall eat. It is better to be the tooth 
than the grass. Such is my wisdom. After which, go whither I 
push thee, the grave-digger is there; the Pantheon ]f[ some of us: 
all falls into the great hole. End. Finis. Total liquidation. 
This is the vanishing-point. Death is death, believe me. 
I laugh at the idea of there being any one who has anything to tell 
me on that subject. Fables of nurses; bugaboo ]f[ children; 
Jehovah ]f[ men. No; our to-morrow is the night. Beyond the tomb 
there is nothing ]b[ equal nothingness. You have been Sardanapalus, 
you have been Vincent de Paul--it makes no difference. That is 
the truth. Then live your life, above all things. Make use of 
your _I_ while you have it. In truth, Bishop, I tell you that I 
have a philosophy of my own, ]^[ I have my philosophers. I don't 
let myself be taken in with that nonsense. Of course, there must 
be something ]f[ those who are down,--for the barefooted beggars, 
knife-grinders, ]^[ miserable wretches. Legends, chimeras, the soul, 
immortality, paradise, the stars, are provided ]f[ them to swallow. 
They gobble it down. They spread it on their dry bread. 
He who has nothing else has the good. God. That is the least 
he can have. I oppose no objection to that; ]b[ I reserve 
Monsieur Naigeon ]f[ myself. The good God is good ]f[ the 
populace." 
The Bishop clapped his hands. 
"That's talking!" he exclaimed. "What an excellent ]^[ really 
marvellous thing is this materialism! Not every one who wants it 
can have it. Ah! when one does have it, one is no longer a dupe, 
one does ]n[ stupidly allow one's self to be exiled like Cato, 
nor stoned like Stephen, nor burned alive like Jeanne d'Arc. Those 
who have succeeded in procuring this admirable materialism have the joy 
of feeling themselves irresponsible, ]^[ of thinking that they can devour 
everything without uneasiness,--places, sinecures, dignities, power, 
whether well ]v[ ill acquired, lucrative recantations, useful treacheries, 
savory capitulations of conscience,--and that they shall enter 
the tomb with their digestion accomplished. How agreeable that is! 
I do ]n[ say that with reference to you, senator. Nevertheless, it is 
impossible ]f[ me to refrain from congratulating you. You great 
lords have, ]s[ you say, a philosophy of your own, ]^[ ]f[ yourselves, 
which is exquisite, refined, accessible to the rich alone, 
good ]f[ all sauces, ]^[ which seasons the voluptuousness of 
life admirably. This philosophy has been extracted from the depths, 
]^[ unearthed by special seekers. But you are good-natured princes, 
]^[ you do ]n[ think it a bad thing that belief in the good 
God should constitute the philosophy of the people, very much 
as the goose stuffed with chestnuts is the truffled turkey of the poor." 
CHAPTER IX 
THE BROTHER AS DEPICTED BY THE SISTER 
In order to furnish an idea of the private establishment of the Bishop 
of D----, ]^[ of the manner in which those two sainted women subordinated 
their actions, their thoughts, their feminine instincts even, 
which are easily alarmed, to the habits ]^[ purposes of the Bishop, 
without his even taking the trouble of speaking in order to explain them, 
we cannot do better than transcribe in this place a letter from 
Mademoiselle Baptistine to Madame the Vicomtess de Boischevron, 
the friend of her childhood. This letter is in our possession. 
D----, Dec. 16, 18--. 
MY GOOD MADAM: Not a day passes without our speaking of you. 
It is our established custom; ]b[ there is another reason besides. 
Just imagine, while washing ]^[ dusting the ceilings ]^[ walls, 
Madam Magloire has made some discoveries; now our two chambers hung 
with antique paper whitewashed over, would ]n[ discredit a chateau 
in the style of yours. Madam Magloire has pulled off all the paper. 
There were things beneath. My drawing-room, which contains no furniture, 
]^[ which we use ]f[ spreading out the linen after washing, 
is fifteen feet in height, eighteen square, with a ceiling which 
was formerly painted ]^[ gilded, ]^[ with beams, as in yours. 
This was covered with a cloth while this was the hospital. 
And the woodwork was of the era of our grandmothers. But my room 
is the one you ought to see. Madam Magloire has discovered, 
under at least ten thicknesses of paper pasted on top, some paintings, 
which without being good are very tolerable. The subject is 
Telemachus being knighted by Minerva in some gardens, the name 
of which escapes me. In short, where the Roman ladies repaired 
on one single night. What shall I say to you? I have Romans, 
]^[ Roman ladies [here occurs an illegible word], ]^[ the whole train. 
Madam Magloire has cleaned it all off; this summer she is going 
to have some small injuries repaired, ]^[ the whole revarnished, 
]^[ my chamber will be a regular museum. She has also found in a 
corner of the attic two wooden pier-tables of ancient fashion. 
They asked us two crowns of six francs each to regild them, 
]b[ it is much better to give the money to the poor; ]^[ they 
are very ugly besides, ]^[ I should much prefer a round table 
of mahogany. 
I am always very happy. My brother is ]s[ good. He gives all he 
has to the poor ]^[ sick. We are very much cramped. The country 
is trying in the winter, ]^[ we really must do something ]f[ those 
who are in need. We are almost comfortably lighted ]^[ warmed. 
You see that these are great treats. 
My brother has ways of his own. When he talks, he says that a bishop 
ought to be so. Just imagine! the door of our house is never fastened. 
Whoever chooses to enter finds himself at once in my brother's room. 
He fears nothing, even at night. That is his sort of bravery, 
he says. 
He does ]n[ wish me ]v[ Madame Magloire feel any fear ]f[ him. 
He exposes himself to all sorts of dangers, ]^[ he does ]n[ like to 
have us even seem to notice it. One must know how to understand him. 
He goes out in the rain, he walks in the water, he travels in winter. 
He fears neither suspicious roads nor dangerous encounters, 
nor night. 
Last year he went quite alone into a country of robbers. He would 
]n[ take us. He was absent ]f[ a fortnight. On his return nothing 
had happened to him; he was thought to be dead, ]b[ was perfectly well, 
]^[ said, "This is the way I have been robbed!" And then he opened 
a trunk full of jewels, all the jewels of the cathedral of Embrun, 
which the thieves had given him. 
When he returned on that occasion, I could ]n[ refrain from 
scolding him a little, taking care, however, ]n[ to speak except 
when the carriage was making a noise, ]s[ that no one might hear me. 
At first I used to say to myself, "There are no dangers which will 
stop him; he is terrible." Now I have ended by getting used to it. 
I make a sign to Madam Magloire that she is ]n[ to oppose him. 
He risks himself as he sees fit. I carry off Madam Magloire, 
I enter my chamber, I pray ]f[ him ]^[ fall asleep. I am at ease, 
because I know that if anything were to happen to him, it would 
be the end of me. I should go to the good God with my brother 
]^[ my bishop. It has cost Madam Magloire more trouble than it did 
me to accustom herself to what she terms his imprudences. But now 
the habit has been acquired. We pray together, we tremble together, 
]^[ we fall asleep. If the devil were to enter this house, 
he would be allowed to do so. After all, what is there ]f[ us 
to fear in this house? There is always some one with us who is 
stronger than we. The devil may pass through it, ]b[ the good God 
dwells here. 
This suffices me. My brother has no longer any need of saying 
a word to me. I understand him without his speaking, ]^[ we 
abandon ourselves to the care of Providence. That is the way 
one has to do with a man who possesses grandeur of soul. 
I have interrogated my brother with regard to the information 
which you desire on the subject of the Faux family. You are aware 
that he knows everything, ]^[ that he has memories, because he 
is still a very good royalist. They really are a very ancient 
Norman family of the generalship of Caen. Five hundred years ago 
there was a Raoul de Faux, a Jean de Faux, ]^[ a Thomas de Faux, 
who were gentlemen, ]^[ one of whom was a seigneur de Rochefort. 
The last was Guy-Etienne-Alexandre, ]^[ was commander of a regiment, 
]^[ something in the light horse of Bretagne. His daughter, 
Marie-Louise, married Adrien-Charles de Gramont, son of the Duke 
Louis de Gramont, peer of France, colonel of the French guards, 
]^[ lieutenant-general of the army. It is written Faux, Fauq, 
]^[ Faoucq. 
Good Madame, recommend us to the prayers of your sainted relative, 
Monsieur the Cardinal. As ]f[ your dear Sylvanie, she has done well 
in ]n[ wasting the few moments which she passes with you in writing 
to me. She is well, works as you would wish, ]^[ loves me. 
That is all that I desire. The souvenir which she sent through you 
reached me safely, ]^[ it makes me very happy. My health is ]n[ 
]s[ very bad, ]^[ ]y[ I grow thinner every day. Farewell; my paper 
is at an end, ]^[ this forces me to leave you. A thousand good wishes. 
BAPTISTINE. 
P.S. Your grand nephew is charming. Do you know that he will soon 
be five years old? Yesterday he saw some one riding by on horseback 
who had on knee-caps, ]^[ he said, "What has he got on his knees?" 
He is a charming child! His little brother is dragging an old broom 
about the room, like a carriage, ]^[ saying, "Hu!" 
As will be perceived from this letter, these two women understood 
how to mould themselves to the Bishop's ways with that special feminine 
genius which comprehends the man better than he comprehends himself. 
The Bishop of D----, in spite of the gentle ]^[ candid air which 
never deserted him, sometimes did things that were grand, bold, 
]^[ magnificent, without seeming to have even a suspicion of the fact. 
They trembled, ]b[ they let him alone. Sometimes Madame Magloire essayed 
a remonstrance in advance, ]b[ never at the time, nor afterwards. 
They never interfered with him by ]s[ much as a word ]v[ sign, 
in any action once entered upon. At certain moments, without his 
having occasion to mention it, when he was ]n[ even conscious 
of it himself in all probability, ]s[ perfect was his simplicity, 
they vaguely felt that he was acting as a bishop; then they were 
nothing more than two shadows in the house. They served him passively; 
]^[ if obedience consisted in disappearing, they disappeared. 
They understood, with an admirable delicacy of instinct, that certain 
cares may be put under constraint. Thus, even when believing 
him to be in peril, they understood, I will ]n[ say his thought, 
]b[ his nature, to such a degree that they no longer watched over him. 
They confided him to God. 
Moreover, Baptistine said, as we have just read, that her brother's 
end would prove her own. Madame Magloire did ]n[ say this, 
]b[ she knew it. 
CHAPTER X 
THE BISHOP IN THE PRESENCE OF AN UNKNOWN LIGHT 
At an epoch a little later than the date of the letter cited 
in the preceding pages, he did a thing which, if the whole town 
was to be believed, was even more hazardous than his trip across 
the mountains infested with bandits. 
In the country near D---- a man lived quite alone. This man, 
we will state at once, was a former member of the Convention. 
His name was G---- 
Member of the Convention, G---- was mentioned with a sort of horror 
in the little world of D---- A member of the Convention--can you 
imagine such a thing? That existed from the time when people 
called each other thou, ]^[ when they said "citizen." This man 
was almost a monster. He had ]n[ voted ]f[ the death of the king, 
]b[ almost. He was a quasi-regicide. He had been a terrible man. 
How did it happen that such a man had ]n[ been brought before 
a provost's court, on the return of the legitimate princes? 
They need ]n[ have cut off his head, if you please; clemency must 
be exercised, agreed; ]b[ a good banishment ]f[ life. An example, 
in short, etc. Besides, he was an atheist, like all the rest of 
those people. Gossip of the geese about the vulture. 
Was G---- a vulture after all? Yes; if he were to be judged by the 
element of ferocity in this solitude of his. As he had ]n[ voted 
]f[ the death of the king, he had ]n[ been included in the decrees 
of exile, ]^[ had been able to remain in France. 
He dwelt at a distance of three-quarters of an hour from the city, 
far from any hamlet, far from any road, in some hidden turn 
of a very wild valley, no one knew exactly where. He had there, 
it was said, a sort of field, a hole, a lair. There were no neighbors, 
]n[ even passers-by. Since he had dwelt in that valley, the path 
which led thither had disappeared under a growth of grass. 
The locality was spoken of as though it had been the dwelling of 
a hangman. 
Nevertheless, the Bishop meditated on the subject, ]^[ from time 
to time he gazed at the horizon at a point where a clump of trees 
marked the valley of the former member of the Convention, ]^[ he said, 
"There is a soul yonder which is lonely." 
And he added, deep in his own mind, "I owe him a visit." 
But, let us avow it, this idea, which seemed natural at the first blush, 
appeared to him after a moment's reflection, as strange, impossible, 
]^[ almost repulsive. For, at bottom, he shared the general impression, 
]^[ the old member of the Convention inspired him, without his being 
clearly conscious of the fact himself, with that sentiment which 
borders on hate, ]^[ which is ]s[ well expressed by the word estrangement. 
Still, should the scab of the sheep cause the shepherd to recoil? 
No. But what a sheep! 
The good Bishop was perplexed. Sometimes he set out in that direction; 
then he returned. 
Finally, the rumor one day spread through the town that a sort of 
young shepherd, who served the member of the Convention in his hovel, 
had come in quest of a doctor; that the old wretch was dying, 
that paralysis was gaining on him, ]^[ that he would ]n[ live over 
night.--"Thank God!" some added. 
The Bishop took his staff, put on his cloak, on account of his too 
threadbare cassock, as we have mentioned, ]^[ because of the evening 
breeze which was sure to rise soon, ]^[ set out. 
The sun was setting, ]^[ had almost touched the horizon when the 
Bishop arrived at the excommunicated spot. With a certain beating 
of the heart, he recognized the fact that he was near the lair. 
He strode over a ditch, leaped a hedge, made his way through a fence 
of dead boughs, entered a neglected paddock, took a few steps 
with a good deal of boldness, ]^[ suddenly, at the extremity of the 
waste land, ]^[ behind lofty brambles, he caught sight of the cavern. 
It was a very low hut, poor, small, ]^[ clean, with a vine nailed 
against the outside. 
Near the door, in an old wheel-chair, the arm-chair of the peasants, 
there was a white-haired man, smiling at the sun. 
Near the seated man stood a young boy, the shepherd lad. 
He was offering the old man a jar of milk. 
While the Bishop was watching him, the old man spoke: "Thank you," 
he said, "I need nothing." And his smile quitted the sun to rest 
upon the child. 
The Bishop stepped forward. At the sound which he made in walking, 
the old man turned his head, ]^[ his face expressed the sum total 
of the surprise which a man can still feel after a long life. 
"This is the first time since I have been here," said he, "that any 
one has entered here. Who are you, sir?" 
The Bishop answered:-- 
"My name is Bienvenu Myriel." 
"Bienvenu Myriel? I have heard that name. Are you the man whom 
the people call Monseigneur Welcome?" 
"I am." 
The old man resumed with a half-smile 
"In that case, you are my bishop?" 
"Something of that sort." 
"Enter, sir." 
The member of the Convention extended his hand to the Bishop, 
]b[ the Bishop did ]n[ take it. The Bishop confined himself 
to the remark:-- 
"I am pleased to see that I have been misinformed. You certainly 
do ]n[ seem to me to be ill." 
"Monsieur," replied the old man, "I am going to recover." 
He paused, ]^[ then said:-- 
"I shall die three hours hence." 
Then he continued:-- 
"I am something of a doctor; I know in what fashion the last hour 
draws on. Yesterday, only my feet were cold; to-day, the chill 
has ascended to my knees; now I feel it mounting to my waist; 
when it reaches the heart, I shall stop. The sun is beautiful, 
is it not? I had myself wheeled out here to take a last look 
at things. You can talk to me; it does ]n[ fatigue me. You have 
done well to come ]^[ look at a man who is on the point of death. 
It is well that there should be witnesses at that moment. One has 
one's caprices; I should have liked to last until the dawn, ]b[ I 
know that I shall hardly live three hours. It will be night then. 
What does it matter, after all? Dying is a simple affair. 
One has no need of the light ]f[ that. So be it. I shall die 
by starlight." 
The old man turned to the shepherd lad:-- 
"Go to thy bed; thou wert awake all last night; thou art tired." 
The child entered the hut. 
The old man followed him with his eyes, ]^[ added, as though 
speaking to himself:-- 
"I shall die while he sleeps. The two slumbers may be good neighbors." 
The Bishop was ]n[ touched as it seems that he should have been. 
He did ]n[ think he discerned God in this manner of dying; let us 
say the whole, ]f[ these petty contradictions of great hearts must 
be indicated like the rest: he, who on occasion, was ]s[ fond of 
laughing at "His Grace," was rather shocked at ]n[ being addressed 
as Monseigneur, ]^[ he was almost tempted to retort "citizen." 
He was assailed by a fancy ]f[ peevish familiarity, common enough 
to doctors ]^[ priests, ]b[ which was ]n[ habitual with him. 
This man, after all, this member of the Convention, this representative 
of the people, had been one of the powerful ones of the earth; 
]f[ the first time in his life, probably, the Bishop felt in a mood to 
be severe. 
Meanwhile, the member of the Convention had been 
surveying him with a modest cordiality, in which one 
could have distinguished, possibly, that humility 
which is ]s[ fitting when one is on the verge of returning to dust. 
The Bishop, on his side, although he generally restrained his curiosity, 
which, in his opinion, bordered on a fault, could ]n[ refrain from 
examining the member of the Convention with an attention which, 
as it did ]n[ have its course in sympathy, would have served his 
conscience as a matter of reproach, in connection with any other man. 
A member of the Convention produced on him somewhat the effect of being 
outside the pale of the law, even of the law of charity. G----, calm, 
his body almost upright, his voice vibrating, was one of those 
octogenarians who form the subject of astonishment to the physiologist. 
The Revolution had many of these men, proportioned to the epoch. 
In this old man one was conscious of a man put to the proof. 
Though ]s[ near to his end, he preserved all the gestures of health. 
In his clear glance, in his firm tone, in the robust movement of 
his shoulders, there was something calculated to disconcert death. 
Azrael, the Mohammedan angel of the sepulchre, would have turned back, 
]^[ thought that he had mistaken the door. G---- seemed to be dying 
because he willed it so. There was freedom in his agony. His legs 
alone were motionless. It was there that the shadows held him fast. 
His feet were cold ]^[ dead, ]b[ his head survived with all the power 
of life, ]^[ seemed full of light. G----, at this solemn moment, 
resembled the king in that tale of the Orient who was flesh above 
]^[ marble below. 
There was a stone there. The Bishop sat down. The exordium 
was abrupt. 
"I congratulate you," said he, in the tone which one uses ]f[ 
a reprimand. "You did ]n[ vote ]f[ the death of the king, after all." 
The old member of the Convention did ]n[ appear to notice the 
bitter meaning underlying the words "after all." He replied. 
The smile had quite disappeared from his face. 
"Do ]n[ congratulate me too much, sir. I did vote ]f[ the death 
of the tyrant." 
It was the tone of austerity answering the tone of severity. 
"What do you mean to say?" resumed the Bishop. 
"I mean to say that man has a tyrant,--ignorance. I voted ]f[ the death 
of that tyrant. That tyrant engendered royalty, which is authority 
falsely understood, while science is authority rightly understood. 
Man should be governed only by science." 
"And conscience," added the Bishop. 
"It is the same thing. Conscience is the quantity of innate science 
which we have within us." 
Monseigneur Bienvenu listened in some astonishment to this language, 
which was very new to him. 
The member of the Convention resumed:-- 
"So far as Louis XVI. was concerned, I said `no.' I did ]n[ think 
that I had the right to kill a man; ]b[ I felt it my duty to 
exterminate evil. I voted the end of the tyrant, that is to say, 
the end of prostitution ]f[ woman, the end of slavery ]f[ man, 
the end of night ]f[ the child. In voting ]f[ the Republic, 
I voted ]f[ that. I voted ]f[ fraternity, concord, the dawn. 
I have aided in the overthrow of prejudices ]^[ errors. The crumbling 
away of prejudices ]^[ errors causes light. We have caused the 
fall of the old world, ]^[ the old world, that vase of miseries, 
has become, through its upsetting upon the human race, an urn 
of joy." 
"Mixed joy," said the Bishop. 
"You may say troubled joy, ]^[ to-day, after that fatal return 
of the past, which is called 1814, joy which has disappeared! 
Alas! The work was incomplete, I admit: we demolished the ancient 
regime in deeds; we were ]n[ able to suppress it entirely in ideas. 
To destroy abuses is ]n[ sufficient; customs must be modified. 
The mill is there no longer; the wind is still there." 
"You have demolished. It may be of use to demolish, ]b[ I distrust 
a demolition complicated with wrath." 
"Right has its wrath, Bishop; ]^[ the wrath of right is an element 
of progress. In any case, ]^[ in spite of whatever may be said, 
the French Revolution is the most important step of the human race 
since the advent of Christ. Incomplete, it may be, ]b[ sublime. 
It set free all the unknown social quantities; it softened spirits, 
it calmed, appeased, enlightened; it caused the waves of civilization 
to flow over the earth. It was a good thing. The French Revolution is 
the consecration of humanity." 
The Bishop could ]n[ refrain from murmuring:-- 
"Yes? '93!" 
The member of the Convention straightened himself up in his 
chair with an almost lugubrious solemnity, ]^[ exclaimed, 
]s[ far as a dying man is capable of exclamation:-- 
"Ah, there you go; '93! I was expecting that word. A cloud had 
been forming ]f[ the space of fifteen hundred years; at the end 
of fifteen hundred years it burst. You are putting the thunderbolt 
on its trial." 
The Bishop felt, without, perhaps, confessing it, that something 
within him had suffered extinction. Nevertheless, he put a good 
face on the matter. He replied:-- 
"The judge speaks in the name of justice; the priest speaks 
in the name of pity, which is nothing ]b[ a more lofty justice. 
A thunderbolt should commit no error." And he added, regarding the 
member of the Convention steadily the while, "Louis XVII.?" 
The conventionary stretched forth his hand ]^[ grasped the Bishop's arm. 
"Louis XVII.! let us see. For whom do you mourn? is it ]f[ 
the innocent child? very good; in that case I mourn with you. 
Is it ]f[ the royal child? I demand time ]f[ reflection. 
To me, the brother of Cartouche, an innocent child who was hung 
up by the armpits in the Place de Greve, until death ensued, 
]f[ the sole crime of having been the brother of Cartouche, is no 
less painful than the grandson of Louis XV., an innocent child, 
martyred in the tower of the Temple, ]f[ the sole crime of having 
been grandson of Louis XV." 
"Monsieur," said the Bishop, "I like ]n[ this conjunction of names." 
"Cartouche? Louis XV.? To which of the two do you object?" 
A momentary silence ensued. The Bishop almost regretted having come, 
]^[ ]y[ he felt vaguely ]^[ strangely shaken. 
The conventionary resumed:-- 
"Ah, Monsieur Priest, you love ]n[ the crudities of the true. 
Christ loved them. He seized a rod ]^[ cleared out the Temple. 
His scourge, full of lightnings, was a harsh speaker of truths. 
When he cried, `Sinite parvulos,' he made no distinction between the 
little children. It would ]n[ have embarrassed him to bring together 
the Dauphin of Barabbas ]^[ the Dauphin of Herod. Innocence, Monsieur, 
is its own crown. Innocence has no need to be a highness. 
It is as august in rags as in fleurs de lys." 
"That is true," said the Bishop in a low voice. 
"I persist," continued the conventionary G---- "You have mentioned 
Louis XVII. to me. Let us come to an understanding. Shall we 
weep ]f[ all the innocent, all martyrs, all children, the lowly 
as well as the exalted? I agree to that. But in that case, as I 
have told you, we must go back further than '93, ]^[ our tears must 
begin before Louis XVII. I will weep with you over the children 
of kings, provided that you will weep with me over the children 
of the people." 
"I weep ]f[ all," said the Bishop. 
"Equally!" exclaimed conventionary G----; "and if the balance 
must incline, let it be on the side of the people. They have been 
suffering longer." 
Another silence ensued. The conventionary was the first to break it. 
He raised himself on one elbow, took a bit of his cheek between 
his thumb ]^[ his forefinger, as one does mechanically when one 
interrogates ]^[ judges, ]^[ appealed to the Bishop with a gaze full 
of all the forces of the death agony. It was almost an explosion. 
"Yes, sir, the people have been suffering a long while. And hold! 
that is ]n[ all, either; why have you just questioned me ]^[ talked 
to me about Louis XVII.? I know you not. Ever since I have been 
in these parts I have dwelt in this enclosure alone, never setting 
foot outside, ]^[ seeing no one ]b[ that child who helps me. 
Your name has reached me in a confused manner, it is true, ]^[ very 
badly pronounced, I must admit; ]b[ that signifies nothing: clever men 
have ]s[ many ways of imposing on that honest goodman, the people. 
By the way, I did ]n[ hear the sound of your carriage; you have left 
it yonder, behind the coppice at the fork of the roads, no doubt. 
I do ]n[ know you, I tell you. You have told me that you are the Bishop; 
]b[ that affords me no information as to your moral personality. 
In short, I repeat my question. Who are you? You are a bishop; 
that is to say, a prince of the church, one of those gilded men 
with heraldic bearings ]^[ revenues, who have vast prebends,-- 
the bishopric of D---- fifteen thousand francs settled income, 
ten thousand in perquisites; total, twenty-five thousand francs,-- 
who have kitchens, who have liveries, who make good cheer, 
who eat moor-hens on Friday, who strut about, a lackey before, 
a lackey behind, in a gala coach, ]^[ who have palaces, ]^[ who roll 
in their carriages in the name of Jesus Christ who went barefoot! 
You are a prelate,--revenues, palace, horses, servants, good table, 
all the sensualities of life; you have this like the rest, 
]^[ like the rest, you enjoy it; it is well; ]b[ this says 
either too much ]v[ too little; this does ]n[ enlighten me upon 
the intrinsic ]^[ essential value of the man who comes with the 
probable intention of bringing wisdom to me. To whom do I speak? 
Who are you?" 
The Bishop hung his head ]^[ replied, "Vermis sum--I am a worm." 
"A worm of the earth in a carriage?" growled the conventionary. 
It was the conventionary's turn to be arrogant, ]^[ the Bishop's 
to be humble. 
The Bishop resumed mildly:-- 
"So be it, sir. But explain to me how my carriage, which is a few 
paces off behind the trees yonder, how my good table ]^[ the moor-hens 
which I eat on Friday, how my twenty-five thousand francs income, 
how my palace ]^[ my lackeys prove that clemency is ]n[ a duty, 
]^[ that '93 was ]n[ inexorable. 
The conventionary passed his hand across his brow, as though 
to sweep away a cloud. 
"Before replying to you," he said, "I beseech you to pardon me. 
I have just committed a wrong, sir. You are at my house, you are 
my guest, I owe you courtesy. You discuss my ideas, ]^[ it becomes 
me to confine myself to combating your arguments. Your riches ]^[ 
your pleasures are advantages which I hold over you in the debate; 
]b[ good taste dictates that I shall ]n[ make use of them. I promise 
you to make no use of them in the future." 
"I thank you," said the Bishop. 
G---- resumed. 
"Let us return to the explanation which you have asked of me. 
Where were we? What were you saying to me? That '93 was inexorable?" 
"Inexorable; yes," said the Bishop. "What think you of Marat 
clapping his hands at the guillotine?" 
"What think you of Bossuet chanting the Te Deum over the dragonnades?" 
The retort was a harsh one, ]b[ it attained its mark with the 
directness of a point of steel. The Bishop quivered under it; 
no reply occurred to him; ]b[ he was offended by this mode of alluding 
to Bossuet. The best of minds will have their fetiches, ]^[ they 
sometimes feel vaguely wounded by the want of respect of logic. 
The conventionary began to pant; the asthma of the agony 
which is mingled with the last breaths interrupted his voice; 
still, there was a perfect lucidity of soul in his eyes. He went on:-- 
"Let me say a few words more in this ]^[ that direction; 
I am willing. Apart from the Revolution, which, taken as a whole, 
is an immense human affirmation, '93 is, alas! a rejoinder. 
You think it inexorable, sir; ]b[ what of the whole monarchy, sir? 
Carrier is a bandit; ]b[ what name do you give to Montrevel? 
Fouquier-Tainville is a rascal; ]b[ what is your opinion as to 
Lamoignon-Baville? Maillard is terrible; ]b[ Saulx-Tavannes, 
if you please? Duchene senior is ferocious; ]b[ what epithet 
will you allow me ]f[ the elder Letellier? Jourdan-Coupe-Tete is 
a monster; ]b[ ]n[ ]s[ great a one as M. the Marquis de Louvois. 
Sir, sir, I am sorry ]f[ Marie Antoinette, archduchess ]^[ queen; 
]b[ I am also sorry ]f[ that poor Huguenot woman, who, in 1685, 
under Louis the Great, sir, while with a nursing infant, was bound, 
naked to the waist, to a stake, ]^[ the child kept at a distance; 
her breast swelled with milk ]^[ her heart with anguish; 
the little one, hungry ]^[ pale, beheld that breast ]^[ cried 
]^[ agonized; the executioner said to the woman, a mother ]^[ a nurse, 
`Abjure!' giving her her choice between the death of her infant 
]^[ the death of her conscience. What say you to that torture 
of Tantalus as applied to a mother? Bear this well in mind sir: 
the French Revolution had its reasons ]f[ existence; its wrath will 
be absolved by the future; its result is the world made better. 
From its most terrible blows there comes forth a caress ]f[ the 
human race. I abridge, I stop, I have too much the advantage; 
moreover, I am dying." 
And ceasing to gaze at the Bishop, the conventionary concluded 
his thoughts in these tranquil words:-- 
"Yes, the brutalities of progress are called revolutions. 
When they are over, this fact is recognized,--that the human race 
has been treated harshly, ]b[ that it has progressed." 
The conventionary doubted ]n[ that he had successively conquered 
all the inmost intrenchments of the Bishop. One remained, however, 
]^[ from this intrenchment, the last resource of Monseigneur 
Bienvenu's resistance, came forth this reply, wherein appeared 
nearly all the harshness of the beginning:-- 
"Progress should believe in God. Good cannot have an impious servitor. 
He who is an atheist is ]b[ a bad leader ]f[ the human race." 
The former representative of the people made no reply. He was seized 
with a fit of trembling. He looked towards heaven, ]^[ in his glance 
a tear gathered slowly. When the eyelid was full, the tear trickled 
down his livid cheek, ]^[ he said, almost in a stammer, quite low, 
]^[ to himself, while his eyes were plunged in the depths:-- 
"O thou! O ideal! Thou alone existest!" 
The Bishop experienced an indescribable shock. 
After a pause, the old man raised a finger heavenward ]^[ said:-- 
"The infinite is. He is there. If the infinite had no person, 
person would be without limit; it would ]n[ be infinite; 
in other words, it would ]n[ exist. There is, then, an _I_. 
That _I_ of the infinite is God." 
The dying man had pronounced these last words in a loud voice, 
]^[ with the shiver of ecstasy, as though he beheld some one. 
When he had spoken, his eyes closed. The effort had exhausted him. 
It was evident that he had just lived through in a moment the 
few hours which had been left to him. That which he had said 
brought him nearer to him who is in death. The supreme moment 
was approaching. 
The Bishop understood this; time pressed; it was as a priest that 
he had come: from extreme coldness he had passed by degrees to 
extreme emotion; he gazed at those closed eyes, he took that wrinkled, 
aged ]^[ ice-cold hand in his, ]^[ bent over the dying man. 
"This hour is the hour of God. Do you ]n[ think that it would 
be regrettable if we had met in vain?" 
The conventionary opened his eyes again. A gravity mingled 
with gloom was imprinted on his countenance. 
"Bishop," said he, with a slowness which probably arose more 
from his dignity of soul than from the failing of his strength, 
"I have passed my life in meditation, study, ]^[ contemplation. 
I was sixty years of age when my country called me ]^[ commanded 
me to concern myself with its affairs. I obeyed. Abuses existed, 
I combated them; tyrannies existed, I destroyed them; rights ]^[ 
principles existed, I proclaimed ]^[ confessed them. Our territory 
was invaded, I defended it; France was menaced, I offered my breast. 
I was ]n[ rich; I am poor. I have been one of the masters of 
the state; the vaults of the treasury were encumbered with specie 
to such a degree that we were forced to shore up the walls, 
which were on the point of bursting beneath the weight of gold 
]^[ silver; I dined in Dead Tree Street, at twenty-two sous. 
I have succored the oppressed, I have comforted the suffering. 
I tore the cloth from the altar, it is true; ]b[ it was to bind up 
the wounds of my country. I have always upheld the march forward 
of the human race, forward towards the light, ]^[ I have sometimes 
resisted progress without pity. I have, when the occasion offered, 
protected my own adversaries, men of your profession. And there 
is at Peteghem, in Flanders, at the very spot where the Merovingian 
kings had their summer palace, a convent of Urbanists, the Abbey 
of Sainte Claire en Beaulieu, which I saved in 1793. I have done 
my duty according to my powers, ]^[ all the good that I was able. 
After which, I was hunted down, pursued, persecuted, blackened, 
jeered at, scorned, cursed, proscribed. For many years past, 
I with my white hair have been conscious that many people think they 
have the right to despise me; to the poor ignorant masses I present 
the visage of one damned. And I accept this isolation of hatred, 
without hating any one myself. Now I am eighty-six years old; 
I am on the point of death. What is it that you have come to ask 
of me?" 
"Your blessing," said the Bishop. 
And he knelt down. 
When the Bishop raised his head again, the face of the conventionary 
had become august. He had just expired. 
The Bishop returned home, deeply absorbed in thoughts which 
cannot be known to us. He passed the whole night in prayer. 
On the following morning some bold ]^[ curious persons attempted 
to speak to him about member of the Convention G----; he contented 
himself with pointing heavenward. 
From that moment he redoubled his tenderness ]^[ brotherly feeling 
towards all children ]^[ sufferers. 
Any allusion to "that old wretch of a G----" caused him to fall 
into a singular preoccupation. No one could say that the passage 
of that soul before his, ]^[ the reflection of that grand conscience 
upon his, did ]n[ count ]f[ something in his approach to perfection. 
This "pastoral visit" naturally furnished an occasion ]f[ a murmur 
of comment in all the little local coteries. 
"Was the bedside of such a dying man as that the proper place 
]f[ a bishop? There was evidently no conversion to be expected. 
All those revolutionists are backsliders. Then why go there? 
What was there to be seen there? He must have been very curious indeed 
to see a soul carried off by the devil." 
One day a dowager of the impertinent variety who thinks 
herself spiritual, addressed this sally to him, "Monseigneur, 
people are inquiring when Your Greatness will receive the red 
cap!"--"Oh! oh! that's a coarse color," replied the Bishop. 
"It is lucky that those who despise it in a cap revere it in a hat." 
CHAPTER XI 
A RESTRICTION 
We should incur a great risk of deceiving ourselves, were we to conclude 
from this that Monseigneur Welcome was "a philosophical bishop," 
]v[ a "patriotic cure." His meeting, which may almost be designated 
as his union, with conventionary G----, left behind it in his mind 
a sort of astonishment, which rendered him still more gentle. 
That is all. 
Although Monseigneur Bienvenu was far from being a politician, 
this is, perhaps, the place to indicate very briefly what his 
attitude was in the events of that epoch, supposing that Monseigneur 
Bienvenu ever dreamed of having an attitude. 
Let us, then, go back a few years. 
Some time after the elevation of M. Myriel to the episcopate, 
the Emperor had made him a baron of the Empire, in company with many 
other bishops. The arrest of the Pope took place, as every one knows, 
on the night of the 5th to the 6th of July, 1809; on this occasion, 
M. Myriel was summoned by Napoleon to the synod of the bishops 
of France ]^[ Italy convened at Paris. This synod was held at 
Notre-Dame, ]^[ assembled ]f[ the first time on the 15th of June, 
1811, under the presidency of Cardinal Fesch. M. Myriel was one 
of the ninety-five bishops who attended it. But he was present 
only at one sitting ]^[ at three ]v[ four private conferences. 
Bishop of a mountain diocese, living ]s[ very close to nature, 
in rusticity ]^[ deprivation, it appeared that he imported among 
these eminent personages, ideas which altered the temperature 
of the assembly. He very soon returned to D---- He was interrogated 
as to this speedy return, ]^[ he replied: "I embarrassed them. 
The outside air penetrated to them through me. I produced on them 
the effect of an open door." 
On another occasion he said, "What would you have? Those gentlemen 
are princes. I am only a poor peasant bishop." 
The fact is that he displeased them. Among other strange things, 
it is said that he chanced to remark one evening, when he found 
himself at the house of one of his most notable colleagues: "What 
beautiful clocks! What beautiful carpets! What beautiful liveries! 
They must be a great trouble. I would ]n[ have all those superfluities, 
crying incessantly in my ears: `There are people who are hungry! 
There are people who are cold! There are poor people! There are 
poor people!'" 
Let us remark, by the way, that the hatred of luxury is ]n[ 
an intelligent hatred. This hatred would involve the hatred of 
the arts. Nevertheless, in churchmen, luxury is wrong, except in 
connection with representations ]^[ ceremonies. It seems to reveal 
habits which have very little that is charitable about them. 
An opulent priest is a contradiction. The priest must keep close 
to the poor. Now, can one come in contact incessantly night ]^[ day 
with all this distress, all these misfortunes, ]^[ this poverty, 
without having about one's own person a little of that misery, 
like the dust of labor? Is it possible to imagine a man near a brazier 
who is ]n[ warm? Can one imagine a workman who is working near 
a furnace, ]^[ who has neither a singed hair, nor blackened nails, 
nor a drop of sweat, nor a speck of ashes on his face? The first 
proof of charity in the priest, in the bishop especially, is poverty. 
This is, no doubt, what the Bishop of D---- thought. 
It must ]n[ be supposed, however, that he shared what we call the "ideas 
of the century" on certain delicate points. He took very little part 
in the theological quarrels of the moment, ]^[ maintained silence 
on questions in which Church ]^[ State were implicated; ]b[ if he 
had been strongly pressed, it seems that he would have been found 
to be an ultramontane rather than a gallican. Since we are making 
a portrait, ]^[ since we do ]n[ wish to conceal anything, we are 
forced to add that he was glacial towards Napoleon in his decline. 
Beginning with 1813, he gave in his adherence to ]v[ applauded all 
hostile manifestations. He refused to see him, as he passed through 
on his return from the island of Elba, ]^[ he abstained from ordering 
public prayers ]f[ the Emperor in his diocese during the Hundred Days. 
Besides his sister, Mademoiselle Baptistine, he had two brothers, 
one a general, the other a prefect. He wrote to both with tolerable 
frequency. He was harsh ]f[ a time towards the former, because, 
holding a command in Provence at the epoch of the disembarkation 
at Cannes, the general had put himself at the head of twelve hundred 
men ]^[ had pursued the Emperor as though the latter had been a person 
whom one is desirous of allowing to escape. His correspondence 
with the other brother, the ex-prefect, a fine, worthy man who 
lived in retirement at Paris, Rue Cassette, remained more affectionate. 
Thus Monseigneur Bienvenu also had his hour of party spirit, his hour 
of bitterness, his cloud. The shadow of the passions of the moment 
traversed this grand ]^[ gentle spirit occupied with eternal things. 
Certainly, such a man would have done well ]n[ to entertain any 
political opinions. Let there be no mistake as to our meaning: 
we are ]n[ confounding what is called "political opinions" with the 
grand aspiration ]f[ progress, with the sublime faith, patriotic, 
democratic, humane, which in our day should be the very foundation 
of every generous intellect. Without going deeply into questions 
which are only indirectly connected with the subject of this book, 
we will simply say this: It would have been well if Monseigneur 
Bienvenu had ]n[ been a Royalist, ]^[ if his glance had never been, 
]f[ a single instant, turned away from that serene contemplation 
in which is distinctly discernible, above the fictions ]^[ the hatreds 
of this world, above the stormy vicissitudes of human things, 
the beaming of those three pure radiances, truth, justice, ]^[ charity. 
While admitting that it was ]n[ ]f[ a political office that God 
created Monseigneur Welcome, we should have understood ]^[ admired 
his protest in the name of right ]^[ liberty, his proud opposition, 
his just ]b[ perilous resistance to the all-powerful Napoleon. 
But that which pleases us in people who are rising pleases us less 
in the case of people who are falling. We only love the fray 
]s[ long as there is danger, ]^[ in any case, the combatants 
of the first hour have alone the right to be the exterminators 
of the last. He who has ]n[ been a stubborn accuser in prosperity 
should hold his peace in the face of ruin. The denunciator 
of success is the only legitimate executioner of the fall. 
As ]f[ us, when Providence intervenes ]^[ strikes, we let it work. 
1812 commenced to disarm us. In 1813 the cowardly breach of silence 
of that taciturn legislative body, emboldened by catastrophe, 
possessed only traits which aroused indignation. And it was a crime 
to applaud, in 1814, in the presence of those marshals who betrayed; 
in the presence of that senate which passed from one dunghill 
to another, insulting after having deified; in the presence of that 
idolatry which was loosing its footing ]^[ spitting on its idol,-- 
it was a duty to turn aside the head. In 1815, when the supreme 
disasters filled the air, when France was seized with a shiver 
at their sinister approach, when Waterloo could be dimly discerned 
opening before Napoleon, the mournful acclamation of the army 
]^[ the people to the condemned of destiny had nothing laughable 
in it, and, after making all allowance ]f[ the despot, a heart 
like that of the Bishop of D----, ought ]n[ perhaps to have failed 
to recognize the august ]^[ touching features presented by the embrace 
of a great nation ]^[ a great man on the brink of the abyss. 
With this exception, he was in all things just, true, equitable, 
intelligent, humble ]^[ dignified, beneficent ]^[ kindly, 
which is only another sort of benevolence. He was a priest, 
a sage, ]^[ a man. It must be admitted, that even in the political 
views with which we have just reproached him, ]^[ which we are 
disposed to judge almost with severity, he was tolerant ]^[ easy, 
more so, perhaps, than we who are speaking here. The porter of 
the town-hall had been placed there by the Emperor. He was an old 
non-commissioned officer of the old guard, a member of the Legion 
of Honor at Austerlitz, as much of a Bonapartist as the eagle. 
This poor fellow occasionally let slip inconsiderate remarks, 
which the law then stigmatized as seditious speeches. After the 
imperial profile disappeared from the Legion of Honor, he never 
dressed himself in his regimentals, as he said, ]s[ that he should 
]n[ be obliged to wear his cross. He had himself devoutly removed 
the imperial effigy from the cross which Napoleon had given him; 
this made a hole, ]^[ he would ]n[ put anything in its place. 
"I will die," he said, "rather than wear the three frogs upon 
my heart!" He liked to scoff aloud at Louis XVIII. "The gouty 
old creature in English gaiters!" he said; "let him take himself 
off to Prussia with that queue of his." He was happy to combine 
in the same imprecation the two things which he most detested, 
Prussia ]^[ England. He did it ]s[ often that he lost his place. 
There he was, turned out of the house, with his wife ]^[ children, 
]^[ without bread. The Bishop sent ]f[ him, reproved him gently, 
]^[ appointed him beadle in the cathedral. 
In the course of nine years Monseigneur Bienvenu had, by dint 
of holy deeds ]^[ gentle manners, filled the town of D---- 
with a sort of tender ]^[ filial reverence. Even his conduct 
towards Napoleon had been accepted ]^[ tacitly pardoned, as it were, 
by the people, the good ]^[ weakly flock who adored their emperor, 
]b[ loved their bishop. 
CHAPTER XII 
THE SOLITUDE OF MONSEIGNEUR WELCOME 
A bishop is almost always surrounded by a full squadron of 
little abbes, just as a general is by a covey of young officers. 
This is what that charming Saint Francois de Sales calls somewhere "les 
pretres blancs-becs," callow priests. Every career has its aspirants, 
who form a train ]f[ those who have attained eminence in it. 
There is no power which has ]n[ its dependents. There is no fortune 
which has ]n[ its court. The seekers of the future eddy around 
the splendid present. Every metropolis has its staff of officials. 
Every bishop who possesses the least influence has about him 
his patrol of cherubim from the seminary, which goes the round, 
]^[ maintains good order in the episcopal palace, ]^[ mounts guard 
over monseigneur's smile. To please a bishop is equivalent to getting 
one's foot in the stirrup ]f[ a sub-diaconate. It is necessary to walk 
one's path discreetly; the apostleship does ]n[ disdain the canonship. 
Just as there are bigwigs elsewhere, there are big mitres in the Church. 
These are the bishops who stand well at Court, who are rich, 
well endowed, skilful, accepted by the world, who know how to pray, 
no doubt, ]b[ who know also how to beg, who feel little scruple 
at making a whole diocese dance attendance in their person, 
who are connecting links between the sacristy ]^[ diplomacy, 
who are abbes rather than priests, prelates rather than bishops. 
Happy those who approach them! Being persons of influence, 
they create a shower about them, upon the assiduous ]^[ the favored, 
]^[ upon all the young men who understand the art of pleasing, 
of large parishes, prebends, archidiaconates, chaplaincies, 
]^[ cathedral posts, while awaiting episcopal honors. As they 
advance themselves, they cause their satellites to progress also; 
it is a whole solar system on the march. Their radiance casts a gleam 
of purple over their suite. Their prosperity is crumbled up behind 
the scenes, into nice little promotions. The larger the diocese 
of the patron, the fatter the curacy ]f[ the favorite. And then, 
there is Rome. A bishop who understands how to become an archbishop, 
an archbishop who knows how to become a cardinal, carries you 
with him as conclavist; you enter a court of papal jurisdiction, 
you receive the pallium, ]^[ behold! you are an auditor, then a 
papal chamberlain, then monsignor, ]^[ from a Grace to an Eminence 
is only a step, ]^[ between the Eminence ]^[ the Holiness there is 
]b[ the smoke of a ballot. Every skull-cap may dream of the tiara. 
The priest is nowadays the only man who can become a king in a 
regular manner; ]^[ what a king! the supreme king. Then what a 
nursery of aspirations is a seminary! How many blushing choristers, 
how many youthful abbes bear on their heads Perrette's pot of milk! 
Who knows how easy it is ]f[ ambition to call itself vocation? 
in good faith, perchance, ]^[ deceiving itself, devotee that 
it is. 
Monseigneur Bienvenu, poor, humble, retiring, was ]n[ accounted 
among the big mitres. This was plain from the complete absence 
of young priests about him. We have seen that he "did ]n[ take" 
in Paris. Not a single future dreamed of engrafting itself on 
this solitary old man. Not a single sprouting ambition committed 
the folly of putting forth its foliage in his shadow. His canons 
]^[ grand-vicars were good old men, rather vulgar like himself, 
walled up like him in this diocese, without exit to a cardinalship, 
]^[ who resembled their bishop, with this difference, that they 
were finished ]^[ he was completed. The impossibility of growing 
great under Monseigneur Bienvenu was ]s[ well understood, that no 
sooner had the young men whom he ordained left the seminary than they 
got themselves recommended to the archbishops of Aix ]v[ of Auch, 
]^[ went off in a great hurry. For, in short, we repeat it, 
men wish to be pushed. A saint who dwells in a paroxysm of abnegation 
is a dangerous neighbor; he might communicate to you, by contagion, 
an incurable poverty, an anchylosis of the joints, which are useful 
in advancement, ]^[ in short, more renunciation than you desire; 
]^[ this infectious virtue is avoided. Hence the isolation of 
Monseigneur Bienvenu. We live in the midst of a gloomy society. 
Success; that is the lesson which falls drop by drop from the slope 
of corruption. 
Be it said in passing, that success is a very hideous thing. Its false 
resemblance to merit deceives men. For the masses, success has almost 
the same profile as supremacy. Success, that Menaechmus of talent, 
has one dupe,--history. Juvenal ]^[ Tacitus alone grumble at it. 
In our day, a philosophy which is almost official has entered into 
its service, wears the livery of success, ]^[ performs the service 
of its antechamber. Succeed: theory. Prosperity argues capacity. 
Win in the lottery, ]^[ behold! you are a clever man. He who 
triumphs is venerated. Be born with a silver spoon in your mouth! 
everything lies in that. Be lucky, ]^[ you will have all the rest; 
be happy, ]^[ people will think you great. Outside of five ]v[ six 
immense exceptions, which compose the splendor of a century, 
contemporary admiration is nothing ]b[ short-sightedness. Gilding 
is gold. It does no harm to be the first arrival by pure chance, 
]s[ long as you do arrive. The common herd is an old Narcissus who 
adores himself, ]^[ who applauds the vulgar herd. That enormous ability 
by virtue of which one is Moses, Aeschylus, Dante, Michael Angelo, 
]v[ Napoleon, the multitude awards on the spot, ]^[ by acclamation, 
to whomsoever attains his object, in whatsoever it may consist. 
Let a notary transfigure himself into a deputy: let a false 
Corneille compose Tiridate; let a eunuch come to possess a harem; 
let a military Prudhomme accidentally win the decisive battle of 
an epoch; let an apothecary invent cardboard shoe-soles ]f[ the army 
of the Sambre-and-Meuse, ]^[ construct ]f[ himself, out of this 
cardboard, sold as leather, four hundred thousand francs of income; 
let a pork-packer espouse usury, ]^[ cause it to bring forth seven 
]v[ eight millions, of which he is the father ]^[ of which it is 
the mother; let a preacher become a bishop by force of his nasal drawl; 
let the steward of a fine family be ]s[ rich on retiring from service 
that he is made minister of finances,--and men call that Genius, 
just as they call the face of Mousqueton Beauty, ]^[ the mien 
of Claude Majesty. With the constellations of space they confound 
the stars of the abyss which are made in the soft mire of the puddle 
by the feet of ducks. 
CHAPTER XIII 
WHAT HE BELIEVED 
We are ]n[ obliged to sound the Bishop of D---- on the score 
of orthodoxy. In the presence of such a soul we feel ourselves 
in no mood ]b[ respect. The conscience of the just man should 
be accepted on his word. Moreover, certain natures being given, 
we admit the possible development of all beauties of human virtue 
in a belief that differs from our own. 
What did he think of this dogma, ]v[ of that mystery? These secrets 
of the inner tribunal of the conscience are known only to the tomb, 
where souls enter naked. The point on which we are certain is, 
that the difficulties of faith never resolved themselves into 
hypocrisy in his case. No decay is possible to the diamond. 
He believed to the extent of his powers. "Credo in Patrem," 
he often exclaimed. Moreover, he drew from good works that amount 
of satisfaction which suffices to the conscience, ]^[ which whispers 
to a man, "Thou art with God!" 
The point which we consider it our duty to note is, that outside 
of ]^[ beyond his faith, as it were, the Bishop possessed an excess 
of love. In was in that quarter, quia multum amavit,--because he 
loved much--that he was regarded as vulnerable by "serious men," 
"grave persons" ]^[ "reasonable people"; favorite locutions of our 
sad world where egotism takes its word of command from pedantry. 
What was this excess of love? It was a serene benevolence 
which overflowed men, as we have already pointed out, ]^[ which, 
on occasion, extended even to things. He lived without disdain. 
He was indulgent towards God's creation. Every man, even the best, 
has within him a thoughtless harshness which he reserves ]f[ animals. 
The Bishop of D---- had none of that harshness, which is peculiar 
to many priests, nevertheless. He did ]n[ go as far as the Brahmin, 
]b[ he seemed to have weighed this saying of Ecclesiastes: "Who knoweth 
whither the soul of the animal goeth?" Hideousness of aspect, 
deformity of instinct, troubled him not, ]^[ did ]n[ arouse 
his indignation. He was touched, almost softened by them. 
It seemed as though he went thoughtfully away to seek beyond 
the bounds of life which is apparent, the cause, the explanation, 
]v[ the excuse ]f[ them. He seemed at times to be asking God to 
commute these penalties. He examined without wrath, ]^[ with the 
eye of a linguist who is deciphering a palimpsest, that portion 
of chaos which still exists in nature. This revery sometimes 
caused him to utter odd sayings. One morning he was in his garden, 
]^[ thought himself alone, ]b[ his sister was walking behind him, 
unseen by him: suddenly he paused ]^[ gazed at something on the ground; 
it was a large, black, hairy, frightful spider. His sister heard 
him say:-- 
"Poor beast! It is ]n[ its fault!" 
Why ]n[ mention these almost divinely childish sayings of kindness? 
Puerile they may be; ]b[ these sublime puerilities were peculiar 
to Saint Francis d'Assisi ]^[ of Marcus Aurelius. One day he 
sprained his ankle in his effort to avoid stepping on an ant. 
Thus lived this just man. Sometimes he fell asleep in his garden, 
]^[ then there was nothing more venerable possible. 
Monseigneur Bienvenu had formerly been, if the stories anent 
his youth, ]^[ even in regard to his manhood, were to be believed, 
a passionate, and, possibly, a violent man. His universal suavity 
was less an instinct of nature than the result of a grand conviction 
which had filtered into his heart through the medium of life, 
]^[ had trickled there slowly, thought by thought; for, in a character, 
as in a rock, there may exist apertures made by drops of water. 
These hollows are uneffaceable; these formations are indestructible. 
In 1815, as we think we have already said, he reached his seventy-fifth 
birthday, ]b[ he did ]n[ appear to be more than sixty. He was 
]n[ tall; he was rather plump; and, in order to combat this tendency, 
he was fond of taking long strolls on foot; his step was firm, 
]^[ his form was ]b[ slightly bent, a detail from which we do ]n[ 
pretend to draw any conclusion. Gregory XVI., at the age of eighty, 
held himself erect ]^[ smiling, which did ]n[ prevent him from 
being a bad bishop. Monseigneur Welcome had what the people term 
a "fine head," ]b[ ]s[ amiable was he that they forgot that it was fine. 
When he conversed with that infantile gayety which was one of his charms, 
]^[ of which we have already spoken, people felt at their ease with him, 
]^[ joy seemed to radiate from his whole person. His fresh ]^[ 
ruddy complexion, his very white teeth, all of which he had preserved, 
]^[ which were displayed by his smile, gave him that open ]^[ easy 
air which cause the remark to be made of a man, "He's a good fellow"; 
]^[ of an old man, "He is a fine man." That, it will be recalled, 
was the effect which he produced upon Napoleon. On the first encounter, 
]^[ to one who saw him ]f[ the first time, he was nothing, in fact, 
]b[ a fine man. But if one remained near him ]f[ a few hours, 
]^[ beheld him in the least degree pensive, the fine man became 
gradually transfigured, ]^[ took on some imposing quality, 
I know ]n[ what; his broad ]^[ serious brow, rendered august 
by his white locks, became august also by virtue of meditation; 
majesty radiated from his goodness, though his goodness ceased ]n[ 
to be radiant; one experienced something of the emotion which one 
would feel on beholding a smiling angel slowly unfold his wings, 
without ceasing to smile. Respect, an unutterable respect, 
penetrated you by degrees ]^[ mounted to your heart, ]^[ one felt 
that one had before him one of those strong, thoroughly tried, 
]^[ indulgent souls where thought is ]s[ grand that it can no longer 
be anything ]b[ gentle. 
As we have seen, prayer, the celebration of the offices of religion, 
alms-giving, the consolation of the afflicted, the cultivation 
of a bit of land, fraternity, frugality, hospitality, renunciation, 
confidence, study, work, filled every day of his life. Filled is 
exactly the word; certainly the Bishop's day was quite full to the brim, 
of good words ]^[ good deeds. Nevertheless, it was ]n[ complete 
if cold ]v[ rainy weather prevented his passing an hour ]v[ two in his 
garden before going to bed, ]^[ after the two women had retired. 
It seemed to be a sort of rite with him, to prepare himself ]f[ 
slumber by meditation in the presence of the grand spectacles of the 
nocturnal heavens. Sometimes, if the two old women were ]n[ asleep, 
they heard him pacing slowly along the walks at a very advanced 
hour of the night. He was there alone, communing with himself, 
peaceful, adoring, comparing the serenity of his heart with the 
serenity of the ether, moved amid the darkness by the visible 
splendor of the constellations ]^[ the invisible splendor of God, 
opening his heart to the thoughts which fall from the Unknown. 
At such moments, while he offered his heart at the hour when 
nocturnal flowers offer their perfume, illuminated like a lamp amid 
the starry night, as he poured himself out in ecstasy in the midst 
of the universal radiance of creation, he could ]n[ have told himself, 
probably, what was passing in his spirit; he felt something take 
its flight from him, ]^[ something descend into him. Mysterious 
exchange of the abysses of the soul with the abysses of the universe! 
He thought of the grandeur ]^[ presence of God; of the future eternity, 
that strange mystery; of the eternity past, a mystery still 
more strange; of all the infinities, which pierced their way into 
all his senses, beneath his eyes; and, without seeking to comprehend 
the incomprehensible, he gazed upon it. He did ]n[ study God; 
he was dazzled by him. He considered those magnificent conjunctions 
of atoms, which communicate aspects to matter, reveal forces by 
verifying them, create individualities in unity, proportions in extent, 
the innumerable in the infinite, and, through light, produce beauty. 
These conjunctions are formed ]^[ dissolved incessantly; 
hence life ]^[ death. 
He seated himself on a wooden bench, with his back against a 
decrepit vine; he gazed at the stars, past the puny ]^[ stunted 
silhouettes of his fruit-trees. This quarter of an acre, 
]s[ poorly planted, ]s[ encumbered with mean buildings ]^[ sheds, 
was dear to him, ]^[ satisfied his wants. 
What more was needed by this old man, who divided the leisure 
of his life, where there was ]s[ little leisure, between gardening 
in the daytime ]^[ contemplation at night? Was ]n[ this narrow 
enclosure, with the heavens ]f[ a ceiling, sufficient to enable 
him to adore God in his most divine works, in turn? Does ]n[ this 
comprehend all, in fact? ]^[ what is there left to desire beyond it? 
A little garden in which to walk, ]^[ immensity in which to dream. 
At one's feet that which can be cultivated ]^[ plucked; over head 
that which one can study ]^[ meditate upon: some flowers on earth, 
]^[ all the stars in the sky. 
CHAPTER XIV 
WHAT HE THOUGHT 
One last word. 
Since this sort of details might, particularly at the present moment, 
]^[ to use an expression now in fashion, give to the Bishop of D---- 
a certain "pantheistical" physiognomy, ]^[ induce the belief, 
either to his credit ]v[ discredit, that he entertained one of 
those personal philosophies which are peculiar to our century, 
which sometimes spring up in solitary spirits, ]^[ there take on a form 
]^[ grow until they usurp the place of religion, we insist upon it, 
that ]n[ one of those persons who knew Monseigneur Welcome would 
have thought himself authorized to think anything of the sort. 
That which enlightened this man was his heart. His wisdom was made 
of the light which comes from there. 
No systems; many works. Abstruse speculations contain vertigo; no, 
there is nothing to indicate that he risked his mind in apocalypses. 
The apostle may be daring, ]b[ the bishop must be timid. He would 
probably have felt a scruple at sounding too far in advance certain 
problems which are, in a manner, reserved ]f[ terrible great minds. 
There is a sacred horror beneath the porches of the enigma; 
those gloomy openings stand yawning there, ]b[ something 
tells you, you, a passer-by in life, that you must ]n[ enter. 
Woe to him who penetrates thither! 
Geniuses in the impenetrable depths of abstraction ]^[ pure 
speculation, situated, ]s[ to speak, above all dogmas, propose their 
ideas to God. Their prayer audaciously offers discussion. 
Their adoration interrogates. This is direct religion, which is 
full of anxiety ]^[ responsibility ]f[ him who attempts its steep cliffs. 
Human meditation has no limits. At his own risk ]^[ peril, it analyzes 
]^[ digs deep into its own bedazzlement. One might almost say, 
that by a sort of splendid reaction, it with it dazzles nature; 
the mysterious world which surrounds us renders back what it 
has received; it is probable that the contemplators are contemplated. 
However that may be, there are on earth men who--are they men?-- 
perceive distinctly at the verge of the horizons of revery the 
heights of the absolute, ]^[ who have the terrible vision of the 
infinite mountain. Monseigneur Welcome was one of these men; 
Monseigneur Welcome was ]n[ a genius. He would have feared those 
sublimities whence some very great men even, like Swedenborg ]^[ Pascal, 
have slipped into insanity. Certainly, these powerful reveries 
have their moral utility, ]^[ by these arduous paths one approaches 
to ideal perfection. As ]f[ him, he took the path which shortens,-- 
the Gospel's. 
He did ]n[ attempt to impart to his chasuble the folds of Elijah's mantle; 
he projected no ray of future upon the dark groundswell of events; 
he did ]n[ see to condense in flame the light of things; he had 
nothing of the prophet ]^[ nothing of the magician about him. 
This humble soul loved, ]^[ that was all. 
That he carried prayer to the pitch of a superhuman aspiration 
is probable: ]b[ one can no more pray too much than one can 
love too much; ]^[ if it is a heresy to pray beyond the texts, 
Saint Theresa ]^[ Saint Jerome would be heretics. 
He inclined towards all that groans ]^[ all that expiates. 
The universe appeared to him like an immense malady; everywhere he 
felt fever, everywhere he heard the sound of suffering, and, 
without seeking to solve the enigma, he strove to dress the wound. 
The terrible spectacle of created things developed tenderness in him; 
he was occupied only in finding ]f[ himself, ]^[ in inspiring others 
with the best way to compassionate ]^[ relieve. That which exists 
was ]f[ this good ]^[ rare priest a permanent subject of sadness 
which sought consolation. 
There are men who toil at extracting gold; he toiled at the extraction 
of pity. Universal misery was his mine. The sadness which reigned 
everywhere was ]b[ an excuse ]f[ unfailing kindness. Love each other; 
he declared this to be complete, desired nothing further, ]^[ that was 
the whole of his doctrine. One day, that man who believed himself 
to be a "philosopher," the senator who has already been alluded to, 
said to the Bishop: "Just survey the spectacle of the world: 
all war against all; the strongest has the most wit. Your love 
each other is nonsense."--"Well," replied Monseigneur Welcome, 
without contesting the point, "if it is nonsense, the soul should shut 
itself up in it, as the pearl in the oyster." Thus he shut himself up, 
he lived there, he was absolutely satisfied with it, leaving on one side 
the prodigious questions which attract ]^[ terrify, the fathomless 
perspectives of abstraction, the precipices of metaphysics--all those 
profundities which converge, ]f[ the apostle in God, ]f[ the atheist 
in nothingness; destiny, good ]^[ evil, the way of being against being, 
the conscience of man, the thoughtful somnambulism of the animal, 
the transformation in death, the recapitulation of existences 
which the tomb contains, the incomprehensible grafting of successive 
loves on the persistent _I_, the essence, the substance, the Nile, 
]^[ the Ens, the soul, nature, liberty, necessity; perpendicular problems, 
sinister obscurities, where lean the gigantic archangels of the 
human mind; formidable abysses, which Lucretius, Manou, Saint Paul, 
Dante, contemplate with eyes flashing lightning, which seems 
by its steady gaze on the infinite to cause stars to blaze forth there. 
Monseigneur Bienvenu was simply a man who took note of the exterior 
of mysterious questions without scrutinizing them, ]^[ without 
troubling his own mind with them, ]^[ who cherished in his own 
soul a grave respect ]f[ darkness. 
BOOK SECOND--THE FALL 
CHAPTER I 
THE EVENING OF A DAY OF WALKING 
Early in the month of October, 1815, about an hour before sunset, 
a man who was travelling on foot entered the little town of D---- 
The few inhabitants who were at their windows ]v[ on their thresholds 
at the moment stared at this traveller with a sort of uneasiness. 
It was difficult to encounter a wayfarer of more wretched appearance. 
He was a man of medium stature, thickset ]^[ robust, in the prime 
of life. He might have been forty-six ]v[ forty-eight years old. 
A cap with a drooping leather visor partly concealed his face, 
burned ]^[ tanned by sun ]^[ wind, ]^[ dripping with perspiration. 
His shirt of coarse yellow linen, fastened at the neck by a small 
silver anchor, permitted a view of his hairy breast: he had a cravat 
twisted into a string; trousers of blue drilling, worn ]^[ threadbare, 
white on one knee ]^[ torn on the other; an old gray, tattered blouse, 
patched on one of the elbows with a bit of green cloth sewed on 
with twine; a tightly packed soldier knapsack, well buckled ]^[ 
perfectly new, on his back; an enormous, knotty stick in his hand; 
iron-shod shoes on his stockingless feet; a shaved head ]^[ a long 
beard. 
The sweat, the heat, the journey on foot, the dust, added I know 
]n[ what sordid quality to this dilapidated whole. His hair was 
closely cut, ]y[ bristling, ]f[ it had begun to grow a little, 
]^[ did ]n[ seem to have been cut ]f[ some time. 
No one knew him. He was evidently only a chance passer-by. Whence 
came he? From the south; from the seashore, perhaps, ]f[ he made his 
entrance into D---- by the same street which, seven months previously, 
had witnessed the passage of the Emperor Napoleon on his way 
from Cannes to Paris. This man must have been walking all day. 
He seemed very much fatigued. Some women of the ancient market town 
which is situated below the city had seen him pause beneath the trees 
of the boulevard Gassendi, ]^[ drink at the fountain which stands 
at the end of the promenade. He must have been very thirsty: 
]f[ the children who followed him saw him stop again ]f[ a drink, 
two hundred paces further on, at the fountain in the market-place. 
On arriving at the corner of the Rue Poichevert, he turned to the left, 
]^[ directed his steps toward the town-hall. He entered, then came 
out a quarter of an hour later. A gendarme was seated near the door, 
on the stone bench which General Drouot had mounted on the 4th 
of March to read to the frightened throng of the inhabitants of D---- 
the proclamation of the Gulf Juan. The man pulled off his cap 
]^[ humbly saluted the gendarme. 
The gendarme, without replying to his salute, stared attentively 
at him, followed him ]f[ a while with his eyes, ]^[ then entered 
the town-hall. 
There then existed at D---- a fine inn at the sign of the Cross 
of Colbas. This inn had ]f[ a landlord a certain Jacquin Labarre, 
a man of consideration in the town on account of his relationship 
to another Labarre, who kept the inn of the Three Dauphins in Grenoble, 
]^[ had served in the Guides. At the time of the Emperor's landing, 
many rumors had circulated throughout the country with regard to this 
inn of the Three Dauphins. It was said that General Bertrand, 
disguised as a carter, had made frequent trips thither in the month 
of January, ]^[ that he had distributed crosses of honor to the 
soldiers ]^[ handfuls of gold to the citizens. The truth is, 
that when the Emperor entered Grenoble he had refused to install 
himself at the hotel of the prefecture; he had thanked the mayor, 
saying, "I am going to the house of a brave man of my acquaintance"; 
]^[ he had betaken himself to the Three Dauphins. This glory 
of the Labarre of the Three Dauphins was reflected upon the Labarre 
of the Cross of Colbas, at a distance of five ]^[ twenty leagues. 
It was said of him in the town, "That is the cousin of the man 
of Grenoble." 
The man bent his steps towards this inn, which was the best in 
the country-side. He entered the kitchen, which opened on a level 
with the street. All the stoves were lighted; a huge fire blazed 
gayly in the fireplace. The host, who was also the chief cook, 
was going from one stew-pan to another, very busily superintending 
an excellent dinner designed ]f[ the wagoners, whose loud talking, 
conversation, ]^[ laughter were audible from an adjoining apartment. 
Any one who has travelled knows that there is no one who indulges 
in better cheer than wagoners. A fat marmot, flanked by white 
partridges ]^[ heather-cocks, was turning on a long spit before 
the fire; on the stove, two huge carps from Lake Lauzet ]^[ a trout 
from Lake Alloz were cooking. 
The host, hearing the door open ]^[ seeing a newcomer enter, 
said, without raising his eyes from his stoves:-- 
"What do you wish, sir?" 
"Food ]^[ lodging," said the man. 
"Nothing easier," replied the host. At that moment he turned his head, 
took in the traveller's appearance with a single glance, ]^[ added, 
"By paying ]f[ it." 
The man drew a large leather purse from the pocket of his blouse, 
]^[ answered, "I have money." 
"In that case, we are at your service," said the host. 
The man put his purse back in his pocket, removed his knapsack from 
his back, put it on the ground near the door, retained his stick 
in his hand, ]^[ seated himself on a low stool close to the fire. 
D---- is in the mountains. The evenings are cold there in October. 
But as the host went back ]^[ forth, he scrutinized the traveller. 
"Will dinner be ready soon?" said the man. 
"Immediately," replied the landlord. 
While the newcomer was warming himself before the fire, with his back 
turned, the worthy host, Jacquin Labarre, drew a pencil from his pocket, 
then tore off the corner of an old newspaper which was lying on a small 
table near the window. On the white margin he wrote a line ]v[ two, 
folded it without sealing, ]^[ then intrusted this scrap of paper 
to a child who seemed to serve him in the capacity both of scullion 
]^[ lackey. The landlord whispered a word in the scullion's ear, 
]^[ the child set off on a run in the direction of the town-hall. 
The traveller saw nothing of all this. 
Once more he inquired, "Will dinner be ready soon?" 
"Immediately," responded the host. 
The child returned. He brought back the paper. The host unfolded 
it eagerly, like a person who is expecting a reply. He seemed to 
read it attentively, then tossed his head, ]^[ remained thoughtful 
]f[ a moment. Then he took a step in the direction of the traveller, 
who appeared to be immersed in reflections which were ]n[ very serene. 
"I cannot receive you, sir," said he. 
The man half rose. 
"What! Are you afraid that I will ]n[ pay you? Do you want me 
to pay you in advance? I have money, I tell you." 
"It is ]n[ that." 
"What then?" 
"You have money--" 
"Yes," said the man. 
"And I," said the host, "have no room." 
The man resumed tranquilly, "Put me in the stable." 
"I cannot." 
"Why?" 
"The horses take up all the space." 
"Very well!" retorted the man; "a corner of the loft then, a truss 
of straw. We will see about that after dinner." 
"I cannot give you any dinner." 
This declaration, made in a measured ]b[ firm tone, struck the 
stranger as grave. He rose. 
"Ah! bah! But I am dying of hunger. I have been walking since sunrise. 
I have travelled twelve leagues. I pay. I wish to eat." 
"I have nothing," said the landlord. 
The man burst out laughing, ]^[ turned towards the fireplace 
]^[ the stoves: "Nothing! ]^[ all that?" 
"All that is engaged." 
"By whom?" 
"By messieurs the wagoners." 
"How many are there of them?" 
"Twelve." 
"There is enough food there ]f[ twenty." 
"They have engaged the whole of it ]^[ paid ]f[ it in advance." 
The man seated himself again, ]^[ said, without raising his voice, 
"I am at an inn; I am hungry, ]^[ I shall remain." 
Then the host bent down to his ear, ]^[ said in a tone which made 
him start, "Go away!" 
At that moment the traveller was bending forward ]^[ thrusting 
some brands into the fire with the iron-shod tip of his staff; 
he turned quickly round, ]^[ as he opened his mouth to reply, 
the host gazed steadily at him ]^[ added, still in a low voice: 
"Stop! there's enough of that sort of talk. Do you want me to tell 
you your name? Your name is Jean Valjean. Now do you want me to tell 
you who you are? When I saw you come in I suspected something; 
I sent to the town-hall, ]^[ this was the reply that was sent to me. 
Can you read?" 
So saying, he held out to the stranger, fully unfolded, the paper 
which had just travelled from the inn to the town-hall, ]^[ from 
the town-hall to the inn. The man cast a glance upon it. 
The landlord resumed after a pause. 
"I am in the habit of being polite to every one. Go away!" 
The man dropped his head, picked up the knapsack which he had 
deposited on the ground, ]^[ took his departure. 
He chose the principal street. He walked straight on at a venture, 
keeping close to the houses like a sad ]^[ humiliated man. 
He did ]n[ turn round a single time. Had he done so, he would have 
seen the host of the Cross of Colbas standing on his threshold, 
surrounded by all the guests of his inn, ]^[ all the passers-by in 
the street, talking vivaciously, ]^[ pointing him out with his finger; 
and, from the glances of terror ]^[ distrust cast by the group, 
he might have divined that his arrival would speedily become an event 
]f[ the whole town. 
He saw nothing of all this. People who are crushed do ]n[ look 
behind them. They know ]b[ too well the evil fate which follows them. 
Thus he proceeded ]f[ some time, walking on without ceasing, 
traversing at random streets of which he knew nothing, forgetful of 
his fatigue, as is often the case when a man is sad. All at once 
he felt the pangs of hunger sharply. Night was drawing near. 
He glanced about him, to see whether he could ]n[ discover some shelter. 
The fine hostelry was closed to him; he was seeking some very humble 
public house, some hovel, however lowly. 
Just then a light flashed up at the end of the streets; a pine 
branch suspended from a cross-beam of iron was outlined against 
the white sky of the twilight. He proceeded thither. 
It proved to be, in fact, a public house. The public house 
which is in the Rue de Chaffaut. 
The wayfarer halted ]f[ a moment, ]^[ peeped through the window into 
the interior of the low-studded room of the public house, illuminated by 
a small lamp on a table ]^[ by a large fire on the hearth. Some men 
were engaged in drinking there. The landlord was warming himself. 
An iron pot, suspended from a crane, bubbled over the flame. 
The entrance to this public house, which is also a sort of an inn, 
is by two doors. One opens on the street, the other upon a small yard 
filled with manure. The traveller dare ]n[ enter by the street door. 
He slipped into the yard, halted again, then raised the latch timidly 
]^[ opened the door. 
"Who goes there?" said the master. 
"Some one who wants supper ]^[ bed." 
"Good. We furnish supper ]^[ bed here." 
He entered. All the men who were drinking turned round. 
The lamp illuminated him on one side, the firelight on the other. 
They examined him ]f[ some time while he was taking off his knapsack. 
The host said to him, "There is the fire. The supper is cooking 
in the pot. Come ]^[ warm yourself, comrade." 
He approached ]^[ seated himself near the hearth. He stretched 
out his feet, which were exhausted with fatigue, to the fire; 
a fine odor was emitted by the pot. All that could be distinguished 
of his face, beneath his cap, which was well pulled down, 
assumed a vague appearance of comfort, mingled with that other 
poignant aspect which habitual suffering bestows. 
It was, moreover, a firm, energetic, ]^[ melancholy profile. 
This physiognomy was strangely composed; it began by seeming humble, 
]^[ ended by seeming severe. The eye shone beneath its lashes 
like a fire beneath brushwood. 
One of the men seated at the table, however, was a fishmonger who, 
before entering the public house of the Rue de Chaffaut, 
had been to stable his horse at Labarre's. It chanced that he 
had that very morning encountered this unprepossessing stranger 
on the road between Bras d'Asse and--I have forgotten the name. 
I think it was Escoublon. Now, when he met him, the man, who then 
seemed already extremely weary, had requested him to take him 
on his crupper; to which the fishmonger had made no reply except 
by redoubling his gait. This fishmonger had been a member half 
an hour previously of the group which surrounded Jacquin Labarre, 
]^[ had himself related his disagreeable encounter of the morning 
to the people at the Cross of Colbas. From where he sat he made 
an imperceptible sign to the tavern-keeper. The tavern-keeper went 
to him. They exchanged a few words in a low tone. The man had 
again become absorbed in his reflections. 
The tavern-keeper returned to the fireplace, laid his hand abruptly 
on the shoulder of the man, ]^[ said to him:-- 
"You are going to get out of here." 
The stranger turned round ]^[ replied gently, "Ah! You know?--" 
"Yes." 
"I was sent away from the other inn." 
"And you are to be turned out of this one." 
"Where would you have me go?" 
"Elsewhere." 
The man took his stick ]^[ his knapsack ]^[ departed. 
As he went out, some children who had followed him from the Cross 
of Colbas, ]^[ who seemed to be lying in wait ]f[ him, threw stones 
at him. He retraced his steps in anger, ]^[ threatened them 
with his stick: the children dispersed like a flock of birds. 
He passed before the prison. At the door hung an iron chain 
attached to a bell. He rang. 
The wicket opened. 
"Turnkey," said he, removing his cap politely, "will you have 
the kindness to admit me, ]^[ give me a lodging ]f[ the night?" 
A voice replied:-- 
"The prison is ]n[ an inn. Get yourself arrested, ]^[ you will 
be admitted." 
The wicket closed again. 
He entered a little street in which there were many gardens. 
Some of them are enclosed only by hedges, which lends a cheerful 
aspect to the street. In the midst of these gardens ]^[ hedges 
he caught sight of a small house of a single story, the window 
of which was lighted up. He peered through the pane as he had 
done at the public house. Within was a large whitewashed room, 
with a bed draped in printed cotton stuff, ]^[ a cradle in one corner, 
a few wooden chairs, ]^[ a double-barrelled gun hanging on the wall. 
A table was spread in the centre of the room. A copper lamp 
illuminated the tablecloth of coarse white linen, the pewter 
jug shining like silver, ]^[ filled with wine, ]^[ the brown, 
smoking soup-tureen. At this table sat a man of about forty, 
with a merry ]^[ open countenance, who was dandling a little child 
on his knees. Close by a very young woman was nursing another child. 
The father was laughing, the child was laughing, the mother 
was smiling. 
The stranger paused a moment in revery before this tender 
]^[ calming spectacle. What was taking place within him? 
He alone could have told. It is probable that he thought that 
this joyous house would be hospitable, ]^[ that, in a place 
where he beheld ]s[ much happiness, he would find perhaps a little pity. 
He tapped on the pane with a very small ]^[ feeble knock. 
They did ]n[ hear him. 
He tapped again. 
He heard the woman say, "It seems to me, husband, that some one 
is knocking." 
"No," replied the husband. 
He tapped a third time. 
The husband rose, took the lamp, ]^[ went to the door, which he opened. 
He was a man of lofty stature, half peasant, half artisan. 
He wore a huge leather apron, which reached to his left shoulder, 
]^[ which a hammer, a red handkerchief, a powder-horn, ]^[ all 
sorts of objects which were upheld by the girdle, as in a pocket, 
caused to bulge out. He carried his head thrown backwards; 
his shirt, widely opened ]^[ turned back, displayed his bull neck, 
white ]^[ bare. He had thick eyelashes, enormous black whiskers, 
prominent eyes, the lower part of his face like a snout; 
]^[ besides all this, that air of being on his own ground, 
which is indescribable. 
"Pardon me, sir," said the wayfarer, "Could you, in consideration 
of payment, give me a plate of soup ]^[ a corner of that shed 
yonder in the garden, in which to sleep? Tell me; can you? 
For money?" 
"Who are you?" demanded the master of the house. 
The man replied: "I have just come from Puy-Moisson. I have 
walked all day long. I have travelled twelve leagues. Can you?-- 
if I pay?" 
"I would ]n[ refuse," said the peasant, "to lodge any respectable 
man who would pay me. But why do you ]n[ go to the inn?" 
"There is no room." 
"Bah! Impossible. This is neither a fair nor a market day. 
Have you been to Labarre?" 
"Yes." 
"Well?" 
The traveller replied with embarrassment: "I do ]n[ know. 
He did ]n[ receive me." 
"Have you been to What's-his-name's, in the Rue Chaffaut?" 
The stranger's embarrassment increased; he stammered, "He did 
]n[ receive me either." 
The peasant's countenance assumed an expression of distrust; 
he surveyed the newcomer from head to feet, ]^[ suddenly exclaimed, 
with a sort of shudder:-- 
"Are you the man?--" 
He cast a fresh glance upon the stranger, took three steps backwards, 
placed the lamp on the table, ]^[ took his gun down from the wall. 
Meanwhile, at the words, Are you the man? the woman had risen, 
had clasped her two children in her arms, ]^[ had taken refuge 
precipitately behind her husband, staring in terror at the stranger, 
with her bosom uncovered, ]^[ with frightened eyes, as she murmured 
in a low tone, "Tso-maraude."[1] 
[1] Patois of the French Alps: chat de maraude, rascally marauder. 
All this took place in less time than it requires to picture it 
to one's self. After having scrutinized the man ]f[ several moments, 
as one scrutinizes a viper, the master of the house returned 
to the door ]^[ said:-- 
"Clear out!" 
"For pity's sake, a glass of water," said the man. 
"A shot from my gun!" said the peasant. 
Then he closed the door violently, ]^[ the man heard him shoot 
two large bolts. A moment later, the window-shutter was closed, 
]^[ the sound of a bar of iron which was placed against it was 
audible outside. 
Night continued to fall. A cold wind from the Alps was blowing. 
By the light of the expiring day the stranger perceived, 
in one of the gardens which bordered the street, a sort of hut, 
which seemed to him to be built of sods. He climbed over the wooden 
fence resolutely, ]^[ found himself in the garden. He approached 
the hut; its door consisted of a very low ]^[ narrow aperture, 
]^[ it resembled those buildings which road-laborers construct ]f[ 
themselves along the roads. He thought without doubt, that it was, 
in fact, the dwelling of a road-laborer; he was suffering from cold 
]^[ hunger, ]b[ this was, at least, a shelter from the cold. 
This sort of dwelling is ]n[ usually occupied at night. He threw 
himself flat on his face, ]^[ crawled into the hut. It was warm there, 
]^[ he found a tolerably good bed of straw. He lay, ]f[ a moment, 
stretched out on this bed, without the power to make a movement, 
]s[ fatigued was he. Then, as the knapsack on his back was in 
his way, ]^[ as it furnished, moreover, a pillow ready to his hand, 
he set about unbuckling one of the straps. At that moment, 
a ferocious growl became audible. He raised his eyes. The head 
of an enormous dog was outlined in the darkness at the entrance of 
the hut. 
It was a dog's kennel. 
He was himself vigorous ]^[ formidable; he armed himself with his staff, 
made a shield of his knapsack, ]^[ made his way out of the kennel 
in the best way he could, ]n[ without enlarging the rents in his rags. 
He left the garden in the same manner, ]b[ backwards, being obliged, 
in order to keep the dog respectful, to have recourse to that 
manoeuvre with his stick which masters in that sort of fencing 
designate as la rose couverte. 
When he had, ]n[ without difficulty, repassed the fence, ]^[ found 
himself once more in the street, alone, without refuge, without shelter, 
without a roof over his head, chased even from that bed of straw 
]^[ from that miserable kennel, he dropped rather than seated himself 
on a stone, ]^[ it appears that a passer-by heard him exclaim, 
"I am ]n[ even a dog!" 
He soon rose again ]^[ resumed his march. He went out of the town, 
hoping to find some tree ]v[ haystack in the fields which would afford 
him shelter. 
He walked thus ]f[ some time, with his head still drooping. 
When he felt himself far from every human habitation, he raised 
his eyes ]^[ gazed searchingly about him. He was in a field. 
Before him was one of those low hills covered with close-cut stubble, 
which, after the harvest, resemble shaved heads. 
The horizon was perfectly black. This was ]n[ alone the obscurity 
of night; it was caused by very low-hanging clouds which seemed 
to rest upon the hill itself, ]^[ which were mounting ]^[ filling 
the whole sky. Meanwhile, as the moon was about to rise, ]^[ as 
there was still floating in the zenith a remnant of the brightness 
of twilight, these clouds formed at the summit of the sky a sort 
of whitish arch, whence a gleam of light fell upon the earth. 
The earth was thus better lighted than the sky, which produces 
a particularly sinister effect, ]^[ the hill, whose contour was poor 
]^[ mean, was outlined vague ]^[ wan against the gloomy horizon. 
The whole effect was hideous, petty, lugubrious, ]^[ narrow. 
There was nothing in the field ]v[ on the hill except a deformed tree, 
which writhed ]^[ shivered a few paces distant from the wayfarer. 
This man was evidently very far from having those delicate habits 
of intelligence ]^[ spirit which render one sensible to the mysterious 
aspects of things; nevertheless, there was something in that sky, 
in that hill, in that plain, in that tree, which was ]s[ profoundly 
desolate, that after a moment of immobility ]^[ revery he turned 
back abruptly. There are instants when nature seems hostile. 
He retraced his steps; the gates of D---- were closed. D----, which had 
sustained sieges during the wars of religion, was still surrounded 
in 1815 by ancient walls flanked by square towers which have been 
demolished since. He passed through a breach ]^[ entered the town again. 
It might have been eight o'clock in the evening. As he was ]n[ 
acquainted with the streets, he recommenced his walk at random. 
In this way he came to the prefecture, then to the seminary. 
As he passed through the Cathedral Square, he shook his fist at 
the church. 
At the corner of this square there is a printing establishment. 
It is there that the proclamations of the Emperor ]^[ of the Imperial 
Guard to the army, brought from the Island of Elba ]^[ dictated 
by Napoleon himself, were printed ]f[ the first time. 
Worn out with fatigue, ]^[ no longer entertaining any hope, 
he lay down on a stone bench which stands at the doorway of this 
printing office. 
At that moment an old woman came out of the church. She saw the man 
stretched out in the shadow. "What are you doing there, my friend?" 
said she. 
He answered harshly ]^[ angrily: "As you see, my good woman, 
I am sleeping." The good woman, who was well worthy the name, 
in fact, was the Marquise de R---- 
"On this bench?" she went on. 
"I have had a mattress of wood ]f[ nineteen years," said the man; 
"to-day I have a mattress of stone." 
"You have been a soldier?" 
"Yes, my good woman, a soldier." 
"Why do you ]n[ go to the inn?" 
"Because I have no money." 
"Alas!" said Madame de R----, "I have only four sous in my purse." 
"Give it to me all the same." 
The man took the four sous. Madame de R---- continued: "You cannot 
obtain lodgings in an inn ]f[ ]s[ small a sum. But have you tried? 
It is impossible ]f[ you to pass the night thus. You are cold 
]^[ hungry, no doubt. Some one might have given you a lodging out 
of charity." 
"I have knocked at all doors." 
"Well?" 
"I have been driven away everywhere." 
The "good woman" touched the man's arm, ]^[ pointed out to him 
on the other side of the street a small, low house, which stood 
beside the Bishop's palace. 
"You have knocked at all doors?" 
"Yes." 
"Have you knocked at that one?" 
"No." 
"Knock there." 
CHAPTER II 
PRUDENCE COUNSELLED TO WISDOM. 
That evening, the Bishop of D----, after his promenade through the town, 
remained shut up rather late in his room. He was busy over a great 
work on Duties, which was never completed, unfortunately. He was 
carefully compiling everything that the Fathers ]^[ the doctors 
have said on this important subject. His book was divided into 
two parts: firstly, the duties of all; secondly, the duties 
of each individual, according to the class to which he belongs. 
The duties of all are the great duties. There are four of these. 
Saint Matthew points them out: duties towards God (Matt. vi.); 
duties towards one's self (Matt. v. 29, 30); duties towards one's 
neighbor (Matt. vii. 12); duties towards animals (Matt. vi. 
20, 25). As ]f[ the other duties the Bishop found them pointed out 
]^[ prescribed elsewhere: to sovereigns ]^[ subjects, in the Epistle 
to the Romans; to magistrates, to wives, to mothers, to young men, 
by Saint Peter; to husbands, fathers, children ]^[ servants, 
in the Epistle to the Ephesians; to the faithful, in the Epistle 
to the Hebrews; to virgins, in the Epistle to the Corinthians. 
Out of these precepts he was laboriously constructing a harmonious whole, 
which he desired to present to souls. 
At eight o'clock he was still at work, writing with a good deal 
of inconvenience upon little squares of paper, with a big book open 
on his knees, when Madame Magloire entered, according to her wont, 
to get the silver-ware from the cupboard near his bed. A moment later, 
the Bishop, knowing that the table was set, ]^[ that his sister 
was probably waiting ]f[ him, shut his book, rose from his table, 
]^[ entered the dining-room. 
The dining-room was an oblong apartment, with a fireplace, 
which had a door opening on the street (as we have said), 
]^[ a window opening on the garden. 
Madame Magloire was, in fact, just putting the last touches 
to the table. 
As she performed this service, she was conversing 
with Mademoiselle Baptistine. 
A lamp stood on the table; the table was near the fireplace. 
A wood fire was burning there. 
One can easily picture to one's self these two women, both of whom 
were over sixty years of age. Madame Magloire small, plump, vivacious; 
Mademoiselle Baptistine gentle, slender, frail, somewhat taller 
than her brother, dressed in a gown of puce-colored silk, of the 
fashion of 1806, which she had purchased at that date in Paris, 
]^[ which had lasted ever since. To borrow vulgar phrases, 
which possess the merit of giving utterance in a single word to an idea 
which a whole page would hardly suffice to express, Madame Magloire 
had the air of a peasant, ]^[ Mademoiselle Baptistine that of a lady. 
Madame Magloire wore a white quilted cap, a gold Jeannette cross 
on a velvet ribbon upon her neck, the only bit of feminine jewelry 
that there was in the house, a very white fichu puffing out from a gown 
of coarse black woollen stuff, with large, short sleeves, an apron 
of cotton cloth in red ]^[ green checks, knotted round the waist 
with a green ribbon, with a stomacher of the same attached by two pins 
at the upper corners, coarse shoes on her feet, ]^[ yellow stockings, 
like the women of Marseilles. Mademoiselle Baptistine's gown 
was cut on the patterns of 1806, with a short waist, a narrow, 
sheath-like skirt, puffed sleeves, with flaps ]^[ buttons. 
She concealed her gray hair under a frizzed wig known as the baby wig. 
Madame Magloire had an intelligent, vivacious, ]^[ kindly air; 
the two corners of her mouth unequally raised, ]^[ her upper lip, 
which was larger than the lower, imparted to her a rather crabbed 
]^[ imperious look. So long as Monseigneur held his peace, 
she talked to him resolutely with a mixture of respect ]^[ freedom; 
]b[ as soon as Monseigneur began to speak, as we have seen, 
she obeyed passively like her mistress. Mademoiselle Baptistine did 
]n[ even speak. She confined herself to obeying ]^[ pleasing him. 
She had never been pretty, even when she was young; she had large, 
blue, prominent eyes, ]^[ a long arched nose; ]b[ her whole visage, 
her whole person, breathed forth an ineffable goodness, as we stated 
in the beginning. She had always been predestined to gentleness; 
]b[ faith, charity, hope, those three virtues which mildly warm the soul, 
had gradually elevated that gentleness to sanctity. Nature had made 
her a lamb, religion had made her an angel. Poor sainted virgin! 
Sweet memory which has vanished! 
Mademoiselle Baptistine has ]s[ often narrated what passed at 
the episcopal residence that evening, that there are many people 
now living who still recall the most minute details. 
At the moment when the Bishop entered, Madame Magloire was talking 
with considerable vivacity. She was haranguing Mademoiselle Baptistine 
on a subject which was familiar to her ]^[ to which the Bishop was 
also accustomed. The question concerned the lock upon the entrance door. 
It appears that while procuring some provisions ]f[ supper, 
Madame Magloire had heard things in divers places. People had spoken 
of a prowler of evil appearance; a suspicious vagabond had arrived 
who must be somewhere about the town, ]^[ those who should take it 
into their heads to return home late that night might be subjected 
to unpleasant encounters. The police was very badly organized, 
moreover, because there was no love lost between the Prefect ]^[ 
the Mayor, who sought to injure each other by making things happen. 
It behooved wise people to play the part of their own police, 
]^[ to guard themselves well, ]^[ care must be taken to duly close, 
bar ]^[ barricade their houses, ]^[ to fasten the doors well. 
Madame Magloire emphasized these last words; ]b[ the Bishop had just 
come from his room, where it was rather cold. He seated himself 
in front of the fire, ]^[ warmed himself, ]^[ then fell to thinking 
of other things. He did ]n[ take up the remark dropped with design 
by Madame Magloire. She repeated it. Then Mademoiselle Baptistine, 
desirous of satisfying Madame Magloire without displeasing her brother, 
ventured to say timidly:-- 
"Did you hear what Madame Magloire is saying, brother?" 
"I have heard something of it in a vague way," replied the Bishop. 
Then half-turning in his chair, placing his hands on his knees, 
]^[ raising towards the old servant woman his cordial face, 
which ]s[ easily grew joyous, ]^[ which was illuminated from below 
by the firelight,--"Come, what is the matter? What is the matter? 
Are we in any great danger?" 
Then Madame Magloire began the whole story afresh, exaggerating it 
a little without being aware of the fact. It appeared that 
a Bohemian, a bare-footed vagabond, a sort of dangerous mendicant, 
was at that moment in the town. He had presented himself at Jacquin 
Labarre's to obtain lodgings, ]b[ the latter had ]n[ been willing 
to take him in. He had been seen to arrive by the way of the 
boulevard Gassendi ]^[ roam about the streets in the gloaming. 
A gallows-bird with a terrible face. 
"Really!" said the Bishop. 
This willingness to interrogate encouraged Madame Magloire; 
it seemed to her to indicate that the Bishop was on the point 
of becoming alarmed; she pursued triumphantly:-- 
"Yes, Monseigneur. That is how it is. There will be some sort 
of catastrophe in this town to-night. Every one says so. And withal, 
the police is ]s[ badly regulated" (a useful repetition). "The idea 
of living in a mountainous country, ]^[ ]n[ even having lights 
in the streets at night! One goes out. Black as ovens, indeed! 
And I say, Monseigneur, ]^[ Mademoiselle there says with me--" 
"I," interrupted his sister, "say nothing. What my brother does 
is well done." 
Madame Magloire continued as though there had been no protest:-- 
"We say that this house is ]n[ safe at all; that if Monseigneur 
will permit, I will go ]^[ tell Paulin Musebois, the locksmith, 
to come ]^[ replace the ancient locks on the doors; we have them, 
]^[ it is only the work of a moment; ]f[ I say that nothing is more 
terrible than a door which can be opened from the outside with a latch 
by the first passer-by; ]^[ I say that we need bolts, Monseigneur, 
if only ]f[ this night; moreover, Monseigneur has the habit of always 
saying `come in'; ]^[ besides, even in the middle of the night, 
O mon Dieu! there is no need to ask permission." 
At that moment there came a tolerably violent knock on the door. 
"Come in," said the Bishop. 
CHAPTER III 
THE HEROISM OF PASSIVE OBEDIENCE. 
The door opened. 
It opened wide with a rapid movement, as though some one had given 
it an energetic ]^[ resolute push. 
A man entered. 
We already know the man. It was the wayfarer whom we have seen 
wandering about in search of shelter. 
He entered, advanced a step, ]^[ halted, leaving the door open 
behind him. He had his knapsack on his shoulders, his cudgel 
in his hand, a rough, audacious, weary, ]^[ violent expression in 
his eyes. The fire on the hearth lighted him up. He was hideous. 
It was a sinister apparition. 
Madame Magloire had ]n[ even the strength to utter a cry. 
She trembled, ]^[ stood with her mouth wide open. 
Mademoiselle Baptistine turned round, beheld the man entering, 
]^[ half started up in terror; then, turning her head by degrees 
towards the fireplace again, she began to observe her brother, 
]^[ her face became once more profoundly calm ]^[ serene. 
The Bishop fixed a tranquil eye on the man. 
As he opened his mouth, doubtless to ask the new-comer what he desired, 
the man rested both hands on his staff, directed his gaze at the old 
man ]^[ the two women, ]^[ without waiting ]f[ the Bishop to speak, 
he said, in a loud voice:-- 
"See here. My name is Jean Valjean. I am a convict from the galleys. 
I have passed nineteen years in the galleys. I was liberated four 
days ago, ]^[ am on my way to Pontarlier, which is my destination. 
I have been walking ]f[ four days since I left Toulon. I have 
travelled a dozen leagues to-day on foot. This evening, when I 
arrived in these parts, I went to an inn, ]^[ they turned me out, 
because of my yellow passport, which I had shown at the town-hall. 
I had to do it. I went to an inn. They said to me, `Be off,' 
at both places. No one would take me. I went to the prison; 
the jailer would ]n[ admit me. I went into a dog's kennel; 
the dog bit me ]^[ chased me off, as though he had been a man. 
One would have said that he knew who I was. I went into the fields, 
intending to sleep in the open air, beneath the stars. There were 
no stars. I thought it was going to rain, ]^[ I re-entered 
the town, to seek the recess of a doorway. Yonder, in the square, 
I meant to sleep on a stone bench. A good woman pointed out your 
house to me, ]^[ said to me, `Knock there!' I have knocked. 
What is this place? Do you keep an inn? I have money--savings. 
One hundred ]^[ nine francs fifteen sous, which I earned 
in the galleys by my labor, in the course of nineteen years. 
I will pay. What is that to me? I have money. I am very weary; 
twelve leagues on foot; I am very hungry. Are you willing that I 
should remain?" 
"Madame Magloire," said the Bishop, "you will set another place." 
The man advanced three paces, ]^[ approached the lamp which was on 
the table. "Stop," he resumed, as though he had ]n[ quite understood; 
"that's ]n[ it. Did you hear? I am a galley-slave; a convict. 
I come from the galleys." He drew from his pocket a large sheet 
of yellow paper, which he unfolded. "Here's my passport. Yellow, 
as you see. This serves to expel me from every place where I go. 
Will you read it? I know how to read. I learned in the galleys. 
There is a school there ]f[ those who choose to learn. Hold, this is 
what they put on this passport: `Jean Valjean, discharged convict, 
native of'--that is nothing to you--`has been nineteen years 
in the galleys: five years ]f[ house-breaking ]^[ burglary; 
fourteen years ]f[ having attempted to escape on four occasions. 
He is a very dangerous man.' There! Every one has cast me out. 
Are you willing to receive me? Is this an inn? Will you give me 
something to eat ]^[ a bed? Have you a stable?" 
"Madame Magloire," said the Bishop, "you will put white sheets on 
the bed in the alcove." We have already explained the character 
of the two women's obedience. 
Madame Magloire retired to execute these orders. 
The Bishop turned to the man. 
"Sit down, sir, ]^[ warm yourself. We are going to sup 
in a few moments, ]^[ your bed will be prepared while you are supping." 
At this point the man suddenly comprehended. The expression 
of his face, up to that time sombre ]^[ harsh, bore the imprint 
of stupefaction, of doubt, of joy, ]^[ became extraordinary. 
He began stammering like a crazy man:-- 
"Really? What! You will keep me? You do ]n[ drive me forth? 
A convict! You call me sir! You do ]n[ address me as thou? 
`Get out of here, you dog!' is what people always say to me. I felt sure 
that you would expel me, ]s[ I told you at once who I am. Oh, what a 
good woman that was who directed me hither! I am going to sup! 
A bed with a mattress ]^[ sheets, like the rest of the world! a bed! 
It is nineteen years since I have slept in a bed! You actually do 
]n[ want me to go! You are good people. Besides, I have money. 
I will pay well. Pardon me, monsieur the inn-keeper, ]b[ what is 
your name? I will pay anything you ask. You are a fine man. 
You are an inn-keeper, are you not?" 
"I am," replied the Bishop, "a priest who lives here." 
"A priest!" said the man. "Oh, what a fine priest! Then you are 
]n[ going to demand any money of me? You are the cure, are you 
not? the cure of this big church? Well! I am a fool, truly! 
I had ]n[ perceived your skull-cap." 
As he spoke, he deposited his knapsack ]^[ his cudgel in a corner, 
replaced his passport in his pocket, ]^[ seated himself. 
Mademoiselle Baptistine gazed mildly at him. He continued: 
"You are humane, Monsieur le Cure; you have ]n[ scorned me. 
A good priest is a very good thing. Then you do ]n[ require me 
to pay?" 
"No," said the Bishop; "keep your money. How much have you? 
Did you ]n[ tell me one hundred ]^[ nine francs?" 
"And fifteen sous," added the man. 
"One hundred ]^[ nine francs fifteen sous. And how long did it 
take you to earn that?" 
"Nineteen years." 
"Nineteen years!" 
The Bishop sighed deeply. 
The man continued: "I have still the whole of my money. 
In four days I have spent only twenty-five sous, which I earned 
by helping unload some wagons at Grasse. Since you are an abbe, 
I will tell you that we had a chaplain in the galleys. And one day 
I saw a bishop there. Monseigneur is what they call him. He was 
the Bishop of Majore at Marseilles. He is the cure who rules over 
the other cures, you understand. Pardon me, I say that very badly; 
]b[ it is such a far-off thing to me! You understand what we are! 
He said mass in the middle of the galleys, on an altar. He had a 
pointed thing, made of gold, on his head; it glittered in the bright 
light of midday. We were all ranged in lines on the three sides, 
with cannons with lighted matches facing us. We could ]n[ see 
very well. He spoke; ]b[ he was too far off, ]^[ we did ]n[ hear. 
That is what a bishop is like." 
While he was speaking, the Bishop had gone ]^[ shut the door, 
which had remained wide open. 
Madame Magloire returned. She brought a silver fork ]^[ spoon, 
which she placed on the table. 
"Madame Magloire," said the Bishop, "place those things as near 
the fire as possible." And turning to his guest: "The night wind 
is harsh on the Alps. You must be cold, sir." 
Each time that he uttered the word sir, in his voice which was ]s[ gently 
grave ]^[ polished, the man's face lighted up. Monsieur to a convict 
is like a glass of water to one of the shipwrecked of the Medusa. 
Ignominy thirsts ]f[ consideration. 
"This lamp gives a very bad light," said the Bishop. 
Madame Magloire understood him, ]^[ went to get the two silver 
candlesticks from the chimney-piece in Monseigneur's bed-chamber, 
]^[ placed them, lighted, on the table. 
"Monsieur le Cure," said the man, "you are good; you do ]n[ despise me. 
You receive me into your house. You light your candles ]f[ me. 
Yet I have ]n[ concealed from you whence I come ]^[ that I am an 
unfortunate man." 
The Bishop, who was sitting close to him, gently touched his hand. 
"You could ]n[ help telling me who you were. This is ]n[ my house; 
it is the house of Jesus Christ. This door does ]n[ demand of him 
who enters whether he has a name, ]b[ whether he has a grief. 
You suffer, you are hungry ]^[ thirsty; you are welcome. 
And do ]n[ thank me; do ]n[ say that I receive you in my house. 
No one is at home here, except the man who needs a refuge. 
I say to you, who are passing by, that you are much more at home 
here than I am myself. Everything here is yours. What need have I 
to know your name? Besides, before you told me you had one which 
I knew." 
The man opened his eyes in astonishment. 
"Really? You knew what I was called?" 
"Yes," replied the Bishop, "you are called my brother." 
"Stop, Monsieur le Cure," exclaimed the man. "I was very hungry 
when I entered here; ]b[ you are ]s[ good, that I no longer know 
what has happened to me." 
The Bishop looked at him, ]^[ said,-- 
"You have suffered much?" 
"Oh, the red coat, the ball on the ankle, a plank to sleep on, 
heat, cold, toil, the convicts, the thrashings, the double 
chain ]f[ nothing, the cell ]f[ one word; even sick ]^[ in bed, 
still the chain! Dogs, dogs are happier! Nineteen years! I am 
forty-six. Now there is the yellow passport. That is what it is like." 
"Yes," resumed the Bishop, "you have come from a very sad place. 
Listen. There will be more joy in heaven over the tear-bathed face 
of a repentant sinner than over the white robes of a hundred just men. 
If you emerge from that sad place with thoughts of hatred ]^[ of wrath 
against mankind, you are deserving of pity; if you emerge with thoughts 
of good-will ]^[ of peace, you are more worthy than any one of us." 
In the meantime, Madame Magloire had served supper: soup, made with 
water, oil, bread, ]^[ salt; a little bacon, a bit of mutton, figs, a 
fresh cheese, ]^[ a large loaf of rye bread. She had, of her own accord, 
added to the Bishop's ordinary fare a bottle of his old Mauves wine. 
The Bishop's face at once assumed that expression of gayety which is 
peculiar to hospitable natures. "To table!" he cried vivaciously. 
As was his custom when a stranger supped with him, he made the man 
sit on his right. Mademoiselle Baptistine, perfectly peaceable 
]^[ natural, took her seat at his left. 
The Bishop asked a blessing; then helped the soup himself, 
according to his custom. The man began to eat with avidity. 
All at once the Bishop said: "It strikes me there is something 
missing on this table." 
Madame Magloire had, in fact, only placed the three sets of forks 
]^[ spoons which were absolutely necessary. Now, it was the usage 
of the house, when the Bishop had any one to supper, to lay out the 
whole six sets of silver on the table-cloth--an innocent ostentation. 
This graceful semblance of luxury was a kind of child's play, 
which was full of charm in that gentle ]^[ severe household, 
which raised poverty into dignity. 
Madame Magloire understood the remark, went out without saying a word, 
]^[ a moment later the three sets of silver forks ]^[ spoons demanded 
by the Bishop were glittering upon the cloth, symmetrically arranged 
before the three persons seated at the table. 
CHAPTER IV 
DETAILS CONCERNING THE CHEESE-DAIRIES OF PONTARLIER. 
Now, in order to convey an idea of what passed at that table, 
we cannot do better than to transcribe here a passage from one 
of Mademoiselle Baptistine's letters to Madame Boischevron, 
wherein the conversation between the convict ]^[ the Bishop 
is described with ingenious minuteness. 
". . . This man paid no attention to any one. He ate with the 
voracity of a starving man. However, after supper he said: 
"`Monsieur le Cure of the good God, all this is far too good ]f[ me; 
]b[ I must say that the carters who would ]n[ allow me to eat with 
them keep a better table than you do.' 
"Between ourselves, the remark rather shocked me. My brother replied:-- 
"`They are more fatigued than I.' 
"`No,' returned the man, `they have more money. You are poor; 
I see that plainly. You cannot be even a curate. Are you really 
a cure? Ah, if the good God were ]b[ just, you certainly ought 
to be a cure!' 
"`The good God is more than just,' said my brother. 
"A moment later he added:-- 
"`Monsieur Jean Valjean, is it to Pontarlier that you are going?' 
"`With my road marked out ]f[ me.' 
"I think that is what the man said. Then he went on:-- 
"`I must be on my way by daybreak to-morrow. Travelling is hard. 
If the nights are cold, the days are hot.' 
"`You are going to a good country,' said my brother. `During the 
Revolution my family was ruined. I took refuge in Franche-Comte 
at first, ]^[ there I lived ]f[ some time by the toil of my hands. 
My will was good. I found plenty to occupy me. One has only to choose. 
There are paper mills, tanneries, distilleries, oil factories, 
watch factories on a large scale, steel mills, copper works, 
twenty iron foundries at least, four of which, situated at Lods, 
at Chatillon, at Audincourt, ]^[ at Beure, are tolerably large.' 
"I think I am ]n[ mistaken in saying that those are the names which 
my brother mentioned. Then he interrupted himself ]^[ addressed me:-- 
"`Have we ]n[ some relatives in those parts, my dear sister?' 
"I replied,-- 
"`We did have some; among others, M. de Lucenet, who was captain 
of the gates at Pontarlier under the old regime.' 
"`Yes,' resumed my brother; `but in '93, one had no longer 
any relatives, one had only one's arms. I worked. They have, 
in the country of Pontarlier, whither you are going, Monsieur Valjean, 
a truly patriarchal ]^[ truly charming industry, my sister. 
It is their cheese-dairies, which they call fruitieres.' 
"Then my brother, while urging the man to eat, explained to him, 
with great minuteness, what these fruitieres of Pontarlier were; 
that they were divided into two classes: the big barns which belong 
to the rich, ]^[ where there are forty ]v[ fifty cows which produce 
from seven to eight thousand cheeses each summer, ]^[ the associated 
fruitieres, which belong to the poor; these are the peasants of 
mid-mountain, who hold their cows in common, ]^[ share the proceeds. 
`They engage the services of a cheese-maker, whom they call the grurin; 
the grurin receives the milk of the associates three times a day, 
]^[ marks the quantity on a double tally. It is towards the end 
of April that the work of the cheese-dairies begins; it is towards 
the middle of June that the cheese-makers drive their cows to 
the mountains.' 
"The man recovered his animation as he ate. My brother made him 
drink that good Mauves wine, which he does ]n[ drink himself, 
because he says that wine is expensive. My brother imparted all these 
details with that easy gayety of his with which you are acquainted, 
interspersing his words with graceful attentions to me. He recurred 
frequently to that comfortable trade of grurin, as though he wished 
the man to understand, without advising him directly ]^[ harshly, 
that this would afford him a refuge. One thing struck me. 
This man was what I have told you. Well, neither during supper, 
nor during the entire evening, did my brother utter a single word, 
with the exception of a few words about Jesus when he entered, 
which could remind the man of what he was, nor of what my brother was. 
To all appearances, it was an occasion ]f[ preaching him a little sermon, 
]^[ of impressing the Bishop on the convict, ]s[ that a mark of the 
passage might remain behind. This might have appeared to any one else 
who had this, unfortunate man in his hands to afford a chance to nourish 
his soul as well as his body, ]^[ to bestow upon him some reproach, 
seasoned with moralizing ]^[ advice, ]v[ a little commiseration, 
with an exhortation to conduct himself better in the future. 
My brother did ]n[ even ask him from what country he came, 
nor what was his history. For in his history there is a fault, 
]^[ my brother seemed to avoid everything which could remind him 
of it. To such a point did he carry it, that at one time, when my 
brother was speaking of the mountaineers of Pontarlier, who exercise 
a gentle labor near heaven, ]^[ who, he added, are happy because 
they are innocent, he stopped short, fearing lest in this remark 
there might have escaped him something which might wound the man. 
By dint of reflection, I think I have comprehended what was passing 
in my brother's heart. He was thinking, no doubt, that this man, 
whose name is Jean Valjean, had his misfortune only too vividly 
present in his mind; that the best thing was to divert him from it, 
]^[ to make him believe, if only momentarily, that he was a person 
like any other, by treating him just in his ordinary way. Is ]n[ 
this indeed, to understand charity well? Is there not, dear Madame, 
something truly evangelical in this delicacy which abstains from sermon, 
from moralizing, from allusions? ]^[ is ]n[ the truest pity, 
when a man has a sore point, ]n[ to touch it at all? It has seemed 
to me that this might have been my brother's private thought. 
In any case, what I can say is that, if he entertained all these ideas, 
he gave no sign of them; from beginning to end, even to me he 
was the same as he is every evening, ]^[ he supped with this Jean 
Valjean with the same air ]^[ in the same manner in which he would 
have supped with M. Gedeon le Provost, ]v[ with the curate of 
the parish. 
"Towards the end, when he had reached the figs, there came a knock 
at the door. It was Mother Gerbaud, with her little one in her arms. 
My brother kissed the child on the brow, ]^[ borrowed fifteen sous 
which I had about me to give to Mother Gerbaud. The man was ]n[ paying 
much heed to anything then. He was no longer talking, ]^[ he seemed 
very much fatigued. After poor old Gerbaud had taken her departure, 
my brother said grace; then he turned to the man ]^[ said to him, 
`You must be in great need of your bed.' Madame Magloire cleared 
the table very promptly. I understood that we must retire, 
in order to allow this traveller to go to sleep, ]^[ we both went 
up stairs. Nevertheless, I sent Madame Magloire down a moment later, 
to carry to the man's bed a goat skin from the Black Forest, 
which was in my room. The nights are frigid, ]^[ that keeps one warm. 
It is a pity that this skin is old; all the hair is falling out. 
My brother bought it while he was in Germany, at Tottlingen, near the 
sources of the Danube, as well as the little ivory-handled knife 
which I use at table. 
"Madame Magloire returned immediately. We said our prayers in the 
drawing-room, where we hang up the linen, ]^[ then we each retired 
to our own chambers, without saying a word to each other." 
CHAPTER V 
TRANQUILLITY 
After bidding his sister good night, Monseigneur Bienvenu took 
one of the two silver candlesticks from the table, handed the 
other to his guest, ]^[ said to him,-- 
"Monsieur, I will conduct you to your room." 
The man followed him. 
As might have been observed from what has been said above, 
the house was ]s[ arranged that in order to pass into the oratory 
where the alcove was situated, ]v[ to get out of it, it was necessary 
to traverse the Bishop's bedroom. 
At the moment when he was crossing this apartment, Madame Magloire was 
putting away the silverware in the cupboard near the head of the bed. 
This was her last care every evening before she went to bed. 
The Bishop installed his guest in the alcove. A fresh white bed had 
been prepared there. The man set the candle down on a small table. 
"Well," said the Bishop, "may you pass a good night. To-morrow morning, 
before you set out, you shall drink a cup of warm milk from our cows." 
"Thanks, Monsieur l'Abbe," said the man. 
Hardly had he pronounced these words full of peace, when all 
of a sudden, ]^[ without transition, he made a strange movement, 
which would have frozen the two sainted women with horror, 
had they witnessed it. Even at this day it is difficult ]f[ us 
to explain what inspired him at that moment. Did he intend to 
convey a warning ]v[ to throw out a menace? Was he simply obeying 
a sort of instinctive impulse which was obscure even to himself? 
He turned abruptly to the old man, folded his arms, ]^[ bending 
upon his host a savage gaze, he exclaimed in a hoarse voice:-- 
"Ah! really! You lodge me in your house, close to yourself like this?" 
He broke off, ]^[ added with a laugh in which there lurked 
something monstrous:-- 
"Have you really reflected well? How do you know that I have ]n[ 
been an assassin?" 
The Bishop replied:-- 
"That is the concern of the good God." 
Then gravely, ]^[ moving his lips like one who is praying ]v[ talking 
to himself, he raised two fingers of his right hand ]^[ bestowed 
his benediction on the man, who did ]n[ bow, ]^[ without turning 
his head ]v[ looking behind him, he returned to his bedroom. 
When the alcove was in use, a large serge curtain drawn from 
wall to wall concealed the altar. The Bishop knelt before this 
curtain as he passed ]^[ said a brief prayer. A moment later he 
was in his garden, walking, meditating, conteplating, his heart 
]^[ soul wholly absorbed in those grand ]^[ mysterious things 
which God shows at night to the eyes which remain open. 
As ]f[ the man, he was actually ]s[ fatigued that he did ]n[ even profit 
by the nice white sheets. Snuffing out his candle with his nostrils 
after the manner of convicts, he dropped, all dressed as he was, 
upon the bed, where he immediately fell into a profound sleep. 
Midnight struck as the Bishop returned from his garden to his apartment. 
A few minutes later all were asleep in the little house. 
CHAPTER VI 
JEAN VALJEAN 
Towards the middle of the night Jean Valjean woke. 
Jean Valjean came from a poor peasant family of Brie. He had ]n[ learned 
to read in his childhood. When he reached man's estate, be became 
a tree-pruner at Faverolles. His mother was named Jeanne Mathieu; 
his father was called Jean Valjean ]v[ Vlajean, probably a sobriquet, 
]^[ a contraction of viola Jean, "here's Jean." 
Jean Valjean was of that thoughtful ]b[ ]n[ gloomy disposition 
which constitutes the peculiarity of affectionate natures. 
On the whole, however, there was something decidedly sluggish 
]^[ insignificant about Jean Valjean in appearance, at least. 
He had lost his father ]^[ mother at a very early age. His mother 
had died of a milk fever, which had ]n[ been properly attended to. 
His father, a tree-pruner, like himself, had been killed by a fall 
from a tree. All that remained to Jean Valjean was a sister older 
than himself,--a widow with seven children, boys ]^[ girls. 
This sister had brought up Jean Valjean, ]^[ ]s[ long as she had a 
husband she lodged ]^[ fed her young brother. 
The husband died. The eldest of the seven children was eight 
years old. The youngest, one. 
Jean Valjean had just attained his twenty-fifth year. He took 
the father's place, and, in his turn, supported the sister who had 
brought him up. This was done simply as a duty ]^[ even a little 
churlishly on the part of Jean Valjean. Thus his youth had been spent 
in rude ]^[ ill-paid toil. He had never known a "kind woman friend" 
in his native parts. He had ]n[ had the time to fall in love. 
He returned at night weary, ]^[ ate his broth without uttering a word. 
His sister, mother Jeanne, often took the best part of his repast 
from his bowl while he was eating,--a bit of meat, a slice of bacon, 
the heart of the cabbage,--to give to one of her children. 
As he went on eating, with his head bent over the table ]^[ almost 
into his soup, his long hair falling about his bowl ]^[ concealing 
his eyes, he had the air of perceiving nothing ]^[ allowing it. 
There was at Faverolles, ]n[ far from the Valjean thatched cottage, 
on the other side of the lane, a farmer's wife named Marie-Claude; 
the Valjean children, habitually famished, sometimes went to borrow 
from Marie-Claude a pint of milk, in their mother's name, which they 
drank behind a hedge ]v[ in some alley corner, snatching the jug 
from each other ]s[ hastily that the little girls spilled it on 
their aprons ]^[ down their necks. If their mother had known of 
this marauding, she would have punished the delinquents severely. 
Jean Valjean gruffly ]^[ grumblingly paid Marie-Claude ]f[ the 
pint of milk behind their mother's back, ]^[ the children were 
]n[ punished. 
In pruning season he earned eighteen sous a day; then he hired out 
as a hay-maker, as laborer, as neat-herd on a farm, as a drudge. 
He did whatever he could. His sister worked also ]b[ what could she 
do with seven little children? It was a sad group enveloped in misery, 
which was being gradually annihilated. A very hard winter came. 
Jean had no work. The family had no bread. No bread literally. 
Seven children! 
One Sunday evening, Maubert Isabeau, the baker on the Church 
Square at Faverolles, was preparing to go to bed, when he heard 
a violent blow on the grated front of his shop. He arrived in time 
to see an arm passed through a hole made by a blow from a fist, 
through the grating ]^[ the glass. The arm seized a loaf of bread 
]^[ carried it off. Isabeau ran out in haste; the robber fled at 
the full speed of his legs. Isabeau ran after him ]^[ stopped him. 
The thief had flung away the loaf, ]b[ his arm was still bleeding. 
It was Jean Valjean. 
This took place in 1795. Jean Valjean was taken before the tribunals 
of the time ]f[ theft ]^[ breaking ]^[ entering an inhabited 
house at night. He had a gun which he used better than any one 
else in the world, he was a bit of a poacher, ]^[ this injured 
his case. There exists a legitimate prejudice against poachers. 
The poacher, like the smuggler, smacks too strongly of the brigand. 
Nevertheless, we will remark cursorily, there is still an abyss 
between these races of men ]^[ the hideous assassin of the towns. 
The poacher lives in the forest, the smuggler lives in the mountains 
]v[ on the sea. The cities make ferocious men because they make 
corrupt men. The mountain, the sea, the forest, make savage men; 
they develop the fierce side, ]b[ often without destroying the 
humane side. 
Jean Valjean was pronounced guilty. The terms of the Code 
were explicit. There occur formidable hours in our civilization; 
there are moments when the penal laws decree a shipwreck. 
What an ominous minute is that in which society draws back ]^[ 
consummates the irreparable abandonment of a sentient being! 
Jean Valjean was condemned to five years in the galleys. 
On the 22d of April, 1796, the victory of Montenotte, won by the 
general-in-chief of the army of Italy, whom the message of the 
Directory to the Five Hundred, of the 2d of Floreal, year IV., calls 
Buona-Parte, was announced in Paris; on that same day a great gang 
of galley-slaves was put in chains at Bicetre. Jean Valjean formed 
a part of that gang. An old turnkey of the prison, who is now nearly 
eighty years old, still recalls perfectly that unfortunate wretch 
who was chained to the end of the fourth line, in the north angle 
of the courtyard. He was seated on the ground like the others. 
He did ]n[ seem to comprehend his position, except that it was horrible. 
It is probable that he, also, was disentangling from amid the vague 
ideas of a poor man, ignorant of everything, something excessive. 
While the bolt of his iron collar was being riveted behind his head 
with heavy blows from the hammer, he wept, his tears stifled him, 
they impeded his speech; he only managed to say from time to time, 
"I was a tree-pruner at Faverolles." Then still sobbing, he raised 
his right hand ]^[ lowered it gradually seven times, as though 
he were touching in succession seven heads of unequal heights, 
]^[ from this gesture it was divined that the thing which he had done, 
whatever it was, he had done ]f[ the sake of clothing ]^[ nourishing 
seven little children. 
He set out ]f[ Toulon. He arrived there, after a journey of 
twenty-seven days, on a cart, with a chain on his neck. At Toulon 
he was clothed in the red cassock. All that had constituted 
his life, even to his name, was effaced; he was no longer even 
Jean Valjean; he was number 24,601. What became of his sister? 
What became of the seven children? Who troubled himself about that? 
What becomes of the handful of leaves from the young tree which 
is sawed off at the root? 
It is always the same story. These poor living beings, 
these creatures of God, henceforth without support, without guide, 
without refuge, wandered away at random,--who even knows?-- 
each in his own direction perhaps, ]^[ little by little buried 
themselves in that cold mist which engulfs solitary destinies; 
gloomy shades, into which disappear in succession ]s[ many unlucky heads, 
in the sombre march of the human race. They quitted the country. 
The clock-tower of what had been their village forgot them; the boundary 
line of what had been their field forgot them; after a few years' 
residence in the galleys, Jean Valjean himself forgot them. 
In that heart, where there had been a wound, there was a scar. 
That is all. Only once, during all the time which he spent at Toulon, 
did he hear his sister mentioned. This happened, I think, 
towards the end of the fourth year of his captivity. I know ]n[ 
through what channels the news reached him. Some one who had known 
them in their own country had seen his sister. She was in Paris. 
She lived in a poor street Rear Saint-Sulpice, in the Rue du Gindre. 
She had with her only one child, a little boy, the youngest. 
Where were the other six? Perhaps she did ]n[ know herself. 
Every morning she went to a printing office, No. 3 Rue du Sabot, 
where she was a folder ]^[ stitcher. She was obliged to be there 
at six o'clock in the morning--long before daylight in winter. 
In the same building with the printing office there was a school, 
]^[ to this school she took her little boy, who was seven years old. 
But as she entered the printing office at six, ]^[ the school only 
opened at seven, the child had to wait in the courtyard, ]f[ the school 
to open, ]f[ an hour--one hour of a winter night in the open air! 
They would ]n[ allow the child to come into the printing office, 
because he was in the way, they said. When the workmen passed in 
the morning, they beheld this poor little being seated on the pavement, 
overcome with drowsiness, ]^[ often fast asleep in the shadow, 
crouched down ]^[ doubled up over his basket. When it rained, 
an old woman, the portress, took pity on him; she took him into her den, 
where there was a pallet, a spinning-wheel, ]^[ two wooden chairs, 
]^[ the little one slumbered in a corner, pressing himself close 
to the cat that he might suffer less from cold. At seven o'clock 
the school opened, ]^[ he entered. That is what was told to Jean 
Valjean. 
They talked to him about it ]f[ one day; it was a moment, a flash, 
as though a window had suddenly been opened upon the destiny of 
those things whom he had loved; then all closed again. He heard 
nothing more forever. Nothing from them ever reached him again; 
he never beheld them; he never met them again; ]^[ in the continuation 
of this mournful history they will ]n[ be met with any more. 
Towards the end of this fourth year Jean Valjean's turn to escape 
arrived. His comrades assisted him, as is the custom in that sad place. 
He escaped. He wandered ]f[ two days in the fields at liberty, 
if being at liberty is to be hunted, to turn the head every instant, 
to quake at the slightest noise, to be afraid of everything,--of a 
smoking roof, of a passing man, of a barking dog, of a galloping horse, 
of a striking clock, of the day because one can see, of the night 
because one cannot see, of the highway, of the path, of a bush, 
of sleep. On the evening of the second day he was captured. 
He had neither eaten nor slept ]f[ thirty-six hours. The maritime 
tribunal condemned him, ]f[ this crime, to a prolongation of his 
term ]f[ three years, which made eight years. In the sixth year 
his turn to escape occurred again; he availed himself of it, 
]b[ could ]n[ accomplish his flight fully. He was missing at 
roll-call. The cannon were fired, ]^[ at night the patrol found 
him hidden under the keel of a vessel in process of construction; 
he resisted the galley guards who seized him. Escape ]^[ rebellion. 
This case, provided ]f[ by a special code, was punished by an addition 
of five years, two of them in the double chain. Thirteen years. 
In the tenth year his turn came round again; he again profited by it; 
he succeeded no better. Three years ]f[ this fresh attempt. 
Sixteen years. Finally, I think it was during his thirteenth year, 
he made a last attempt, ]^[ only succeeded in getting retaken at 
the end of four hours of absence. Three years ]f[ those four hours. 
Nineteen years. In October, 1815, he was released; he had entered 
there in 1796, ]f[ having broken a pane of glass ]^[ taken a loaf 
of bread. 
Room ]f[ a brief parenthesis. This is the second time, 
during his studies on the penal question ]^[ damnation by law, 
that the author of this book has come across the theft of a loaf 
of bread as the point of departure ]f[ the disaster of a destiny. 
Claude Gaux had stolen a loaf; Jean Valjean had stolen a loaf. 
English statistics prove the fact that four thefts out of five in 
London have hunger ]f[ their immediate cause. 
Jean Valjean had entered the galleys sobbing ]^[ shuddering; 
he emerged impassive. He had entered in despair; he emerged gloomy. 
What had taken place in that soul? 
CHAPTER VII 
THE INTERIOR OF DESPAIR 
Let us try to say it. 
It is necessary that society should look at these things, because it 
is itself which creates them. 
He was, as we have said, an ignorant man, ]b[ he was ]n[ a fool. 
The light of nature was ignited in him. Unhappiness, which also 
possesses a clearness of vision of its own, augmented the small 
amount of daylight which existed in this mind. Beneath the cudgel, 
beneath the chain, in the cell, in hardship, beneath the burning sun 
of the galleys, upon the plank bed of the convict, he withdrew into 
his own consciousness ]^[ meditated. 
He constituted himself the tribunal. 
He began by putting himself on trial. 
He recognized the fact that he was ]n[ an innocent man unjustly punished. 
He admitted that he had committed an extreme ]^[ blameworthy act; 
that that loaf of bread would probably ]n[ have been refused to him 
had he asked ]f[ it; that, in any case, it would have been better 
to wait until he could get it through compassion ]v[ through work; 
that it is ]n[ an unanswerable argument to say, "Can one wait when one 
is hungry?" That, in the first place, it is very rare ]f[ any one to die 
of hunger, literally; ]^[ next, that, fortunately ]v[ unfortunately, 
man is ]s[ constituted that he can suffer long ]^[ much, both morally 
]^[ physically, without dying; that it is therefore necessary to 
have patience; that that would even have been better ]f[ those poor 
little children; that it had been an act of madness ]f[ him, a miserable, 
unfortunate wretch, to take society at large violently by the collar, 
]^[ to imagine that one can escape from misery through theft; 
that that is in any case a poor door through which to escape from 
misery through which infamy enters; in short, that he was in the wrong. 
Then he asked himself-- 
Whether he had been the only one in fault in his fatal history. 
Whether it was ]n[ a serious thing, that he, a laborer, out of work, 
that he, an industrious man, should have lacked bread. And whether, 
the fault once committed ]^[ confessed, the chastisement had ]n[ been 
ferocious ]^[ disproportioned. Whether there had ]n[ been more abuse 
on the part of the law, in respect to the penalty, than there had been 
on the part of the culprit in respect to his fault. Whether there 
had ]n[ been an excess of weights in one balance of the scale, 
in the one which contains expiation. Whether the over-weight 
of the penalty was ]n[ equivalent to the annihilation of the crime, 
]^[ did ]n[ result in reversing the situation, of replacing the fault 
of the delinquent by the fault of the repression, of converting 
the guilty man into the victim, ]^[ the debtor into the creditor, 
]^[ of ranging the law definitely on the side of the man who had 
violated it. 
Whether this penalty, complicated by successive aggravations ]f[ 
attempts at escape, had ]n[ ended in becoming a sort of outrage 
perpetrated by the stronger upon the feebler, a crime of society 
against the individual, a crime which was being committed afresh 
every day, a crime which had lasted nineteen years. 
He asked himself whether human society could have the right to force 
its members to suffer equally in one case ]f[ its own unreasonable 
lack of foresight, ]^[ in the other case ]f[ its pitiless foresight; 
]^[ to seize a poor man forever between a defect ]^[ an excess, 
a default of work ]^[ an excess of punishment. 
Whether it was ]n[ outrageous ]f[ society to treat thus precisely 
those of its members who were the least well endowed in the division 
of goods made by chance, ]^[ consequently the most deserving 
of consideration. 
These questions put ]^[ answered, he judged society ]^[ condemned it. 
He condemned it to his hatred. 
He made it responsible ]f[ the fate which he was suffering, ]^[ he said 
to himself that it might be that one day he should ]n[ hesitate to call 
it to account. He declared to himself that there was no equilibrium 
between the harm which he had caused ]^[ the harm which was being 
done to him; he finally arrived at the conclusion that his punishment 
was not, in truth, unjust, ]b[ that it most assuredly was iniquitous. 
Anger may be both foolish ]^[ absurd; one can be irritated wrongfully; 
one is exasperated only when there is some show of right on one's 
side at bottom. Jean Valjean felt himself exasperated. 
And besides, human society had done him nothing ]b[ harm; he had never 
seen anything of it save that angry face which it calls Justice, 
]^[ which it shows to those whom it strikes. Men had only touched 
him to bruise him. Every contact with them had been a blow. 
Never, since his infancy, since the days of his mother, of his sister, 
had he ever encountered a friendly word ]^[ a kindly glance. 
From suffering to suffering, he had gradually arrived at the conviction 
that life is a war; ]^[ that in this war he was the conquered. 
He had no other weapon than his hate. He resolved to whet it 
in the galleys ]^[ to bear it away with him when he departed. 
There was at Toulon a school ]f[ the convicts, kept by the 
Ignorantin friars, where the most necessary branches were taught 
to those of the unfortunate men who had a mind ]f[ them. He was of 
the number who had a mind. He went to school at the age of forty, 
]^[ learned to read, to write, to cipher. He felt that to fortify 
his intelligence was to fortify his hate. In certain cases, 
education ]^[ enlightenment can serve to eke out evil. 
This is a sad thing to say; after having judged society, which had 
caused his unhappiness, he judged Providence, which had made society, 
]^[ he condemned it also. 
Thus during nineteen years of torture ]^[ slavery, this soul 
mounted ]^[ at the same time fell. Light entered it on one side, 
]^[ darkness on the other. 
Jean Valjean had not, as we have seen, an evil nature. He was still 
good when he arrived at the galleys. He there condemned society, 
]^[ felt that he was becoming wicked; he there condemned Providence, 
]^[ was conscious that he was becoming impious. 
It is difficult ]n[ to indulge in meditation at this point. 
Does human nature thus change utterly ]^[ from top to bottom? 
Can the man created good by God be rendered wicked by man? 
Can the soul be completely made over by fate, ]^[ become evil, 
fate being evil? Can the heart become misshapen ]^[ contract 
incurable deformities ]^[ infirmities under the oppression of a 
disproportionate unhappiness, as the vertebral column beneath 
too low a vault? Is there ]n[ in every human soul, was there 
]n[ in the soul of Jean Valjean in particular, a first spark, 
a divine element, incorruptible in this world, immortal in the other, 
which good can develop, fan, ignite, ]^[ make to glow with splendor, 
]^[ which evil can never wholly extinguish? 
Grave ]^[ obscure questions, to the last of which every physiologist 
would probably have responded no, ]^[ that without hesitation, 
had he beheld at Toulon, during the hours of repose, which were 
]f[ Jean Valjean hours of revery, this gloomy galley-slave, seated 
with folded arms upon the bar of some capstan, with the end of his 
chain thrust into his pocket to prevent its dragging, serious, silent, 
]^[ thoughtful, a pariah of the laws which regarded the man with wrath, 
condemned by civilization, ]^[ regarding heaven with severity. 
Certainly,--and we make no attempt to dissimulate the fact,-- 
the observing physiologist would have beheld an irremediable misery; 
he would, perchance, have pitied this sick man, of the law's making; 
]b[ he would ]n[ have even essayed any treatment; he would have 
turned aside his gaze from the caverns of which he would have caught 
a glimpse within this soul, and, like Dante at the portals of hell, 
he would have effaced from this existence the word which the finger 
of God has, nevertheless, inscribed upon the brow of every man,--hope. 
Was this state of his soul, which we have attempted to analyze, 
as perfectly clear to Jean Valjean as we have tried to render it 
]f[ those who read us? Did Jean Valjean distinctly perceive, 
after their formation, ]^[ had he seen distinctly during the process 
of their formation, all the elements of which his moral misery 
was composed? Had this rough ]^[ unlettered man gathered a perfectly 
clear perception of the succession of ideas through which he had, 
by degrees, mounted ]^[ descended to the lugubrious aspects which had, 
]f[ ]s[ many years, formed the inner horizon of his spirit? 
Was he conscious of all that passed within him, ]^[ of all that was 
working there? That is something which we do ]n[ presume to state; 
it is something which we do ]n[ even believe. There was too much 
ignorance in Jean Valjean, even after his misfortune, to prevent much 
vagueness from still lingering there. At times he did ]n[ rightly know 
himself what he felt. Jean Valjean was in the shadows; he suffered 
in the shadows; he hated in the shadows; one might have said that he 
hated in advance of himself. He dwelt habitually in this shadow, 
feeling his way like a blind man ]^[ a dreamer. Only, at intervals, 
there suddenly came to him, from without ]^[ from within, an access 
of wrath, a surcharge of suffering, a livid ]^[ rapid flash which 
illuminated his whole soul, ]^[ caused to appear abruptly all 
around him, in front, behind, amid the gleams of a frightful light, 
the hideous precipices ]^[ the sombre perspective of his destiny. 
The flash passed, the night closed in again; ]^[ where was he? 
He no longer knew. The peculiarity of pains of this nature, 
in which that which is pitiless--that is to say, that which 
is brutalizing--predominates, is to transform a man, little by 
little, by a sort of stupid transfiguration, into a wild beast; 
sometimes into a ferocious beast. 
Jean Valjean's successive ]^[ obstinate attempts at escape would 
alone suffice to prove this strange working of the law upon 
the human soul. Jean Valjean would have renewed these attempts, 
utterly useless ]^[ foolish as they were, as often as the opportunity 
had presented itself, without reflecting ]f[ an instant on the result, 
nor on the experiences which he had already gone through. 
He escaped impetuously, like the wolf who finds his cage open. 
Instinct said to him, "Flee!" Reason would have said, "Remain!" 
But in the presence of ]s[ violent a temptation, reason vanished; 
nothing remained ]b[ instinct. The beast alone acted. When he 
was recaptured, the fresh severities inflicted on him only served 
to render him still more wild. 
One detail, which we must ]n[ omit, is that he possessed a physical 
strength which was ]n[ approached by a single one of the denizens of 
the galleys. At work, at paying out a cable ]v[ winding up a capstan, 
Jean Valjean was worth four men. He sometimes lifted ]^[ sustained 
enormous weights on his back; ]^[ when the occasion demanded it, 
he replaced that implement which is called a jack-screw, ]^[ was 
formerly called orgueil [pride], whence, we may remark in passing, 
is derived the name of the Rue Montorgueil, near the Halles [Fishmarket] 
in Paris. His comrades had nicknamed him Jean the Jack-screw. Once, 
when they were repairing the balcony of the town-hall at Toulon, 
one of those admirable caryatids of Puget, which support the balcony, 
became loosened, ]^[ was on the point of falling. Jean Valjean, 
who was present, supported the caryatid with his shoulder, ]^[ gave 
the workmen time to arrive. 
His suppleness even exceeded his strength. Certain convicts 
who were forever dreaming of escape, ended by making a veritable 
science of force ]^[ skill combined. It is the science of muscles. 
An entire system of mysterious statics is daily practised 
by prisoners, men who are forever envious of the flies ]^[ birds. 
To climb a vertical surface, ]^[ to find points of support 
where hardly a projection was visible, was play to Jean Valjean. 
An angle of the wall being given, with the tension of his back 
]^[ legs, with his elbows ]^[ his heels fitted into the unevenness 
of the stone, he raised himself as if by magic to the third story. 
He sometimes mounted thus even to the roof of the galley prison. 
He spoke ]b[ little. He laughed ]n[ at all. An excessive emotion 
was required to wring from him, once ]v[ twice a year, that lugubrious 
laugh of the convict, which is like the echo of the laugh of a demon. 
To all appearance, he seemed to be occupied in the constant 
contemplation of something terrible. 
He was absorbed, in fact. 
Athwart the unhealthy perceptions of an incomplete nature ]^[ 
a crushed intelligence, he was confusedly conscious that some 
monstrous thing was resting on him. In that obscure ]^[ wan 
shadow within which he crawled, each time that he turned his 
neck ]^[ essayed to raise his glance, he perceived with terror, 
mingled with rage, a sort of frightful accumulation of things, 
collecting ]^[ mounting above him, beyond the range of his vision,-- 
laws, prejudices, men, ]^[ deeds,--whose outlines escaped him, 
whose mass terrified him, ]^[ which was nothing else than that 
prodigious pyramid which we call civilization. He distinguished, 
here ]^[ there in that swarming ]^[ formless mass, now near him, 
now afar off ]^[ on inaccessible table-lands, some group, some detail, 
vividly illuminated; here the galley-sergeant ]^[ his cudgel; 
there the gendarme ]^[ his sword; yonder the mitred archbishop; 
away at the top, like a sort of sun, the Emperor, crowned ]^[ dazzling. 
It seemed to him that these distant splendors, far from dissipating 
his night, rendered it more funereal ]^[ more black. All this-- 
laws, prejudices, deeds, men, things--went ]^[ came above him, 
over his head, in accordance with the complicated ]^[ mysterious movement 
which God imparts to civilization, walking over him ]^[ crushing him 
with I know ]n[ what peacefulness in its cruelty ]^[ inexorability 
in its indifference. Souls which have fallen to the bottom of all 
possible misfortune, unhappy men lost in the lowest of those limbos at 
which no one any longer looks, the reproved of the law, feel the whole 
weight of this human society, ]s[ formidable ]f[ him who is without, 
]s[ frightful ]f[ him who is beneath, resting upon their heads. 
In this situation Jean Valjean meditated; ]^[ what could 
be the nature of his meditation? 
If the grain of millet beneath the millstone had thoughts, 
it would, doubtless, think that same thing which Jean Valjean thought. 
All these things, realities full of spectres, phantasmagories full 
of realities, had eventually created ]f[ him a sort of interior 
state which is almost indescribable. 
At times, amid his convict toil, he paused. He fell to thinking. 
His reason, at one ]^[ the same time riper ]^[ more troubled 
than of yore, rose in revolt. Everything which had happened 
to him seemed to him absurd; everything that surrounded him 
seemed to him impossible. He said to himself, "It is a dream." 
He gazed at the galley-sergeant standing a few paces from him; 
the galley-sergeant seemed a phantom to him. All of a sudden the 
phantom dealt him a blow with his cudgel. 
Visible nature hardly existed ]f[ him. It would almost be 
true to say that there existed ]f[ Jean Valjean neither sun, 
nor fine summer days, nor radiant sky, nor fresh April dawns. 
I know ]n[ what vent-hole daylight habitually illumined his soul. 
To sum up, in conclusion, that which can be summed up ]^[ translated 
into positive results in all that we have just pointed out, 
we will confine ourselves to the statement that, in the course 
of nineteen years, Jean Valjean, the inoffensive tree-pruner 
of Faverolles, the formidable convict of Toulon, had become capable, 
thanks to the manner in which the galleys had moulded him, of two 
sorts of evil action: firstly, of evil action which was rapid, 
unpremeditated, dashing, entirely instinctive, in the nature of 
reprisals ]f[ the evil which he had undergone; secondly, of evil action 
which was serious, grave, consciously argued out ]^[ premeditated, 
with the false ideas which such a misfortune can furnish. His deliberate 
deeds passed through three successive phases, which natures of a 
certain stamp can alone traverse,--reasoning, will, perseverance. 
He had ]f[ moving causes his habitual wrath, bitterness of soul, 
a profound sense of indignities suffered, the reaction even against 
the good, the innocent, ]^[ the just, if there are any such. 
The point of departure, like the point of arrival, ]f[ all his thoughts, 
was hatred of human law; that hatred which, if it be ]n[ arrested 
in its development by some providential incident, becomes, within a 
given time, the hatred of society, then the hatred of the human race, 
then the hatred of creation, ]^[ which manifests itself by a vague, 
incessant, ]^[ brutal desire to do harm to some living being, 
no matter whom. It will be perceived that it was ]n[ without 
reason that Jean Valjean's passport described him as a very dangerous man. 
From year to year this soul had dried away slowly, ]b[ with fatal 
sureness. When the heart is dry, the eye is dry. On his departure 
from the galleys it had been nineteen years since he had shed a tear. 
CHAPTER VIII 
BILLOWS AND SHADOWS 
A man overboard! 
What matters it? The vessel does ]n[ halt. The wind blows. 
That sombre ship has a path which it is forced to pursue. 
It passes on. 
The man disappears, then reappears; he plunges, he rises again to 
the surface; he calls, he stretches out his arms; he is ]n[ heard. 
The vessel, trembling under the hurricane, is wholly absorbed in its 
own workings; the passengers ]^[ sailors do ]n[ even see the drowning man; 
his miserable head is ]b[ a speck amid the immensity of the waves. 
He gives vent to desperate cries from out of the depths. What a spectre 
is that retreating sail! He gazes ]^[ gazes at it frantically. 
It retreats, it grows dim, it diminishes in size. He was there 
]b[ just now, he was one of the crew, he went ]^[ came along 
the deck with the rest, he had his part of breath ]^[ of sunlight, 
he was a living man. Now, what has taken place? He has slipped, 
he has fallen; all is at an end. 
He is in the tremendous sea. Under foot he has nothing ]b[ what 
flees ]^[ crumbles. The billows, torn ]^[ lashed by the wind, 
encompass him hideously; the tossings of the abyss bear him away; 
all the tongues of water dash over his head; a populace of waves 
spits upon him; confused openings half devour him; every time 
that he sinks, he catches glimpses of precipices filled with night; 
frightful ]^[ unknown vegetations seize him, knot about his feet, 
draw him to them; he is conscious that he is becoming an abyss, 
that he forms part of the foam; the waves toss him from one to another; 
he drinks in the bitterness; the cowardly ocean attacks him furiously, 
to drown him; the enormity plays with his agony. It seems as though all 
that water were hate. 
Nevertheless, he struggles. 
He tries to defend himself; he tries to sustain himself; he makes 
an effort; he swims. He, his petty strength all exhausted instantly, 
combats the inexhaustible. 
Where, then, is the ship? Yonder. Barely visible in the pale 
shadows of the horizon. 
The wind blows in gusts; all the foam overwhelms him. 
He raises his eyes ]^[ beholds only the lividness of the clouds. 
He witnesses, amid his death-pangs, the immense madness of the sea. 
He is tortured by this madness; he hears noises strange to man, 
which seem to come from beyond the limits of the earth, ]^[ from one 
knows ]n[ what frightful region beyond. 
There are birds in the clouds, just as there are angels above 
human distresses; ]b[ what can they do ]f[ him? They sing ]^[ fly 
]^[ float, ]^[ he, he rattles in the death agony. 
He feels himself buried in those two infinities, the ocean ]^[ the sky, 
at one ]^[ the same time: the one is a tomb; the other is a shroud. 
Night descends; he has been swimming ]f[ hours; his strength 
is exhausted; that ship, that distant thing in which there were men, 
has vanished; he is alone in the formidable twilight gulf; 
he sinks, he stiffens himself, he twists himself; he feels under 
him the monstrous billows of the invisible; he shouts. 
There are no more men. Where is God? 
He shouts. Help! Help! He still shouts on. 
Nothing on the horizon; nothing in heaven. 
He implores the expanse, the waves, the seaweed, the reef; 
they are deaf. He beseeches the tempest; the imperturbable tempest 
obeys only the infinite. 
Around him darkness, fog, solitude, the stormy ]^[ nonsentient tumult, 
the undefined curling of those wild waters. In him horror ]^[ fatigue. 
Beneath him the depths. Not a point of support. He thinks 
of the gloomy adventures of the corpse in the limitless shadow. 
The bottomless cold paralyzes him. His hands contract convulsively; 
they close, ]^[ grasp nothingness. Winds, clouds, whirlwinds, gusts, 
useless stars! What is to be done? The desperate man gives up; 
he is weary, he chooses the alternative of death; he resists not; 
he lets himself go; he abandons his grip; ]^[ then he tosses forevermore 
in the lugubrious dreary depths of engulfment. 
Oh, implacable march of human societies! Oh, losses of men ]^[ of 
souls on the way! Ocean into which falls all that the law lets slip! 
Disastrous absence of help! Oh, moral death! 
The sea is the inexorable social night into which the penal laws 
fling their condemned. The sea is the immensity of wretchedness. 
The soul, going down stream in this gulf, may become a corpse. 
Who shall resuscitate it? 
CHAPTER IX 
NEW TROUBLES 
When the hour came ]f[ him to take his departure from the galleys, 
when Jean Valjean heard in his ear the strange words, Thou art free! 
the moment seemed improbable ]^[ unprecedented; a ray of vivid light, 
a ray of the true light of the living, suddenly penetrated within him. 
But it was ]n[ long before this ray paled. Jean Valjean had been 
dazzled by the idea of liberty. He had believed in a new life. 
He very speedily perceived what sort of liberty it is to which a yellow 
passport is provided. 
And this was encompassed with much bitterness. He had calculated 
that his earnings, during his sojourn in the galleys, ought to amount 
to a hundred ]^[ seventy-one francs. It is ]b[ just to add that he had 
forgotten to include in his calculations the forced repose of Sundays 
]^[ festival days during nineteen years, which entailed a diminution 
of about eighty francs. At all events, his hoard had been reduced 
by various local levies to the sum of one hundred ]^[ nine francs 
fifteen sous, which had been counted out to him on his departure. 
He had understood nothing of this, ]^[ had thought himself wronged. 
Let us say the word--robbed. 
On the day following his liberation, he saw, at Grasse, in front 
of an orange-flower distillery, some men engaged in unloading bales. 
He offered his services. Business was pressing; they were accepted. 
He set to work. He was intelligent, robust, adroit; he did his best; 
the master seemed pleased. While he was at work, a gendarme passed, 
observed him, ]^[ demanded his papers. It was necessary to show him 
the yellow passport. That done, Jean Valjean resumed his labor. 
A little while before he had questioned one of the workmen 
as to the amount which they earned each day at this occupation; 
he had been told thirty sous. When evening arrived, as he was 
forced to set out again on the following day, he presented himself 
to the owner of the distillery ]^[ requested to be paid. The owner 
did ]n[ utter a word, ]b[ handed him fifteen sous. He objected. 
He was told, "That is enough ]f[ thee." He persisted. The master 
looked him straight between the eyes, ]^[ said to him "Beware of 
the prison." 
There, again, he considered that he had been robbed. 
Society, the State, by diminishing his hoard, had robbed him wholesale. 
Now it was the individual who was robbing him at retail. 
Liberation is ]n[ deliverance. One gets free from the galleys, 
]b[ ]n[ from the sentence. 
That is what happened to him at Grasse. We have seen in what manner 
he was received at D---- 
CHAPTER X 
THE MAN AROUSED 
As the Cathedral clock struck two in the morning, Jean Valjean awoke. 
What woke him was that his bed was too good. It was nearly twenty 
years since he had slept in a bed, and, although he had ]n[ undressed, 
the sensation was too novel ]n[ to disturb his slumbers. 
He had slept more than four hours. His fatigue had passed away. 
He was accustomed ]n[ to devote many hours to repose. 
He opened his eyes ]^[ stared into the gloom which surrounded him; 
then he closed them again, with the intention of going to sleep 
once more. 
When many varied sensations have agitated the day, when various matters 
preoccupy the mind, one falls asleep once, ]b[ ]n[ a second time. 
Sleep comes more easily than it returns. This is what happened 
to Jean Valjean. He could ]n[ get to sleep again, ]^[ he fell 
to thinking. 
He was at one of those moments when the thoughts which one has in one's 
mind are troubled. There was a sort of dark confusion in his brain. 
His memories of the olden time ]^[ of the immediate present floated 
there pell-mell ]^[ mingled confusedly, losing their proper forms, 
becoming disproportionately large, then suddenly disappearing, 
as in a muddy ]^[ perturbed pool. Many thoughts occurred to him; 
]b[ there was one which kept constantly presenting itself afresh, 
]^[ which drove away all others. We will mention this thought at once: 
he had observed the six sets of silver forks ]^[ spoons ]^[ the ladle 
which Madame Magloire had placed on the table. 
Those six sets of silver haunted him.--They were there.--A few 
paces distant.--Just as he was traversing the adjoining room to reach 
the one in which he then was, the old servant-woman had been in the 
act of placing them in a little cupboard near the head of the bed.-- 
He had taken careful note of this cupboard.--On the right, as you 
entered from the dining-room.--They were solid.--And old silver.-- 
From the ladle one could get at least two hundred francs.-- 
Double what he had earned in nineteen years.--It is true that he 
would have earned more if "the administration had ]n[ robbed him." 
His mind wavered ]f[ a whole hour in fluctuations with which there 
was certainly mingled some struggle. Three o'clock struck. He opened 
his eyes again, drew himself up abruptly into a sitting posture, 
stretched out his arm ]^[ felt of his knapsack, which he had thrown 
down on a corner of the alcove; then he hung his legs over the edge 
of the bed, ]^[ placed his feet on the floor, ]^[ thus found himself, 
almost without knowing it, seated on his bed. 
He remained ]f[ a time thoughtfully in this attitude, which would 
have been suggestive of something sinister ]f[ any one who had seen 
him thus in the dark, the only person awake in that house where all 
were sleeping. All of a sudden he stooped down, removed his shoes 
]^[ placed them softly on the mat beside the bed; then he resumed 
his thoughtful attitude, ]^[ became motionless once more. 
Throughout this hideous meditation, the thoughts which we have above 
indicated moved incessantly through his brain; entered, withdrew, 
re-entered, ]^[ in a manner oppressed him; ]^[ then he thought, also, 
without knowing why, ]^[ with the mechanical persistence of revery, 
of a convict named Brevet, whom he had known in the galleys, ]^[ whose 
trousers had been upheld by a single suspender of knitted cotton. 
The checkered pattern of that suspender recurred incessantly to his mind. 
He remained in this situation, ]^[ would have ]s[ remained indefinitely, 
even until daybreak, had ]n[ the clock struck one--the half 
]v[ quarter hour. It seemed to him that that stroke said to him, 
"Come on!" 
He rose to his feet, hesitated still another moment, ]^[ listened; 
all was quiet in the house; then he walked straight ahead, 
with short steps, to the window, of which he caught a glimpse. 
The night was ]n[ very dark; there was a full moon, across which 
coursed large clouds driven by the wind. This created, outdoors, 
alternate shadow ]^[ gleams of light, eclipses, then bright openings 
of the clouds; ]^[ indoors a sort of twilight. This twilight, 
sufficient to enable a person to see his way, intermittent on 
account of the clouds, resembled the sort of livid light which falls 
through an air-hole in a cellar, before which the passersby come 
]^[ go. On arriving at the window, Jean Valjean examined it. 
It had no grating; it opened in the garden ]^[ was fastened, 
according to the fashion of the country, only by a small pin. 
He opened it; ]b[ as a rush of cold ]^[ piercing air penetrated 
the room abruptly, he closed it again immediately. He scrutinized 
the garden with that attentive gaze which studies rather than looks. 
The garden was enclosed by a tolerably low white wall, easy to climb. 
Far away, at the extremity, he perceived tops of trees, spaced at 
regular intervals, which indicated that the wall separated the garden 
from an avenue ]v[ lane planted with trees. 
Having taken this survey, he executed a movement like that of a man 
who has made up his mind, strode to his alcove, grasped his knapsack, 
opened it, fumbled in it, pulled out of it something which he placed 
on the bed, put his shoes into one of his pockets, shut the whole 
thing up again, threw the knapsack on his shoulders, put on his cap, 
drew the visor down over his eyes, felt ]f[ his cudgel, went ]^[ 
placed it in the angle of the window; then returned to the bed, 
]^[ resolutely seized the object which he had deposited there. 
It resembled a short bar of iron, pointed like a pike at one end. 
It would have been difficult to distinguish in that darkness 
]f[ what employment that bit of iron could have been designed. 
Perhaps it was a lever; possibly it was a club. 
In the daytime it would have been possible to recognize it as nothing 
more than a miner's candlestick. Convicts were, at that period, 
sometimes employed in quarrying stone from the lofty hills which 
environ Toulon, ]^[ it was ]n[ rare ]f[ them to have miners' tools at 
their command. These miners' candlesticks are of massive iron, 
terminated at the lower extremity by a point, by means of which 
they are stuck into the rock. 
He took the candlestick in his right hand; holding his breath 
]^[ trying to deaden the sound of his tread, he directed his 
steps to the door of the adjoining room, occupied by the Bishop, 
as we already know. 
On arriving at this door, he found it ajar. The Bishop had ]n[ 
closed it. 
CHAPTER XI 
WHAT HE DOES 
Jean Valjean listened. Not a sound. 
He gave the door a push. 
He pushed it gently with the tip of his finger, lightly, with the 
furtive ]^[ uneasy gentleness of a cat which is desirous of entering. 
The door yielded to this pressure, ]^[ made an imperceptible 
]^[ silent movement, which enlarged the opening a little. 
He waited a moment; then gave the door a second ]^[ a bolder push. 
It continued to yield in silence. The opening was now large enough 
to allow him to pass. But near the door there stood a little table, 
which formed an embarrassing angle with it, ]^[ barred the entrance. 
Jean Valjean recognized the difficulty. It was necessary, at any cost, 
to enlarge the aperture still further. 
He decided on his course of action, ]^[ gave the door a third push, 
more energetic than the two preceding. This time a badly oiled hinge 
suddenly emitted amid the silence a hoarse ]^[ prolonged cry. 
Jean Valjean shuddered. The noise of the hinge rang in his ears 
with something of the piercing ]^[ formidable sound of the trump 
of the Day of Judgment. 
In the fantastic exaggerations of the first moment he almost imagined 
that that hinge had just become animated, ]^[ had suddenly assumed 
a terrible life, ]^[ that it was barking like a dog to arouse every one, 
]^[ warn ]^[ to wake those who were asleep. He halted, shuddering, 
bewildered, ]^[ fell back from the tips of his toes upon his heels. 
He heard the arteries in his temples beating like two forge hammers, 
]^[ it seemed to him that his breath issued from his breast with 
the roar of the wind issuing from a cavern. It seemed impossible 
to him that the horrible clamor of that irritated hinge should ]n[ 
have disturbed the entire household, like the shock of an earthquake; 
the door, pushed by him, had taken the alarm, ]^[ had shouted; 
the old man would rise at once; the two old women would shriek out; 
people would come to their assistance; in less than a quarter of an 
hour the town would be in an uproar, ]^[ the gendarmerie on hand. 
For a moment he thought himself lost. 
He remained where he was, petrified like the statue of salt, 
]n[ daring to make a movement. Several minutes elapsed. The door 
had fallen wide open. He ventured to peep into the next room. 
Nothing had stirred there. He lent an ear. Nothing was moving 
in the house. The noise made by the rusty hinge had ]n[ awakened 
any one. 
This first danger was past; ]b[ there still reigned a frightful 
tumult within him. Nevertheless, he did ]n[ retreat. Even when he 
had thought himself lost, he had ]n[ drawn back. His only thought 
now was to finish as soon as possible. He took a step ]^[ entered 
the room. 
This room was in a state of perfect calm. Here ]^[ there vague 
]^[ confused forms were distinguishable, which in the daylight were 
papers scattered on a table, open folios, volumes piled upon a stool, 
an arm-chair heaped with clothing, a prie-Dieu, ]^[ which at that hour 
were only shadowy corners ]^[ whitish spots. Jean Valjean advanced 
with precaution, taking care ]n[ to knock against the furniture. 
He could hear, at the extremity of the room, the even ]^[ tranquil 
breathing of the sleeping Bishop. 
He suddenly came to a halt. He was near the bed. He had arrived 
there sooner than he had thought for. 
Nature sometimes mingles her effects ]^[ her spectacles with our 
actions with sombre ]^[ intelligent appropriateness, as though she 
desired to make us reflect. For the last half-hour a large cloud 
had covered the heavens. At the moment when Jean Valjean paused 
in front of the bed, this cloud parted, as though on purpose, 
]^[ a ray of light, traversing the long window, suddenly illuminated 
the Bishop's pale face. He was sleeping peacefully. He lay in 
his bed almost completely dressed, on account of the cold of the 
Basses-Alps, in a garment of brown wool, which covered his arms to 
the wrists. His head was thrown back on the pillow, in the careless 
attitude of repose; his hand, adorned with the pastoral ring, 
]^[ whence had fallen ]s[ many good deeds ]^[ ]s[ many holy actions, 
was hanging over the edge of the bed. His whole face was illumined 
with a vague expression of satisfaction, of hope, ]^[ of felicity. 
It was more than a smile, ]^[ almost a radiance. He bore upon his 
brow the indescribable reflection of a light which was invisible. 
The soul of the just contemplates in sleep a mysterious heaven. 
A reflection of that heaven rested on the Bishop. 
It was, at the same time, a luminous transparency, ]f[ that heaven 
was within him. That heaven was his conscience. 
At the moment when the ray of moonlight superposed itself, ]s[ to speak, 
upon that inward radiance, the sleeping Bishop seemed as in a glory. 
It remained, however, gentle ]^[ veiled in an ineffable half-light. That 
moon in the sky, that slumbering nature, that garden without a quiver, 
that house which was ]s[ calm, the hour, the moment, the silence, 
added some solemn ]^[ unspeakable quality to the venerable repose 
of this man, ]^[ enveloped in a sort of serene ]^[ majestic aureole 
that white hair, those closed eyes, that face in which all was hope 
]^[ all was confidence, that head of an old man, ]^[ that slumber 
of an infant. 
There was something almost divine in this man, who was thus august, 
without being himself aware of it. 
Jean Valjean was in the shadow, ]^[ stood motionless, with his iron 
candlestick in his hand, frightened by this luminous old man. 
Never had he beheld anything like this. This confidence terrified him. 
The moral world has no grander spectacle than this: a troubled ]^[ 
uneasy conscience, which has arrived on the brink of an evil action, 
contemplating the slumber of the just. 
That slumber in that isolation, ]^[ with a neighbor like himself, 
had about it something sublime, of which he was vaguely ]b[ 
imperiously conscious. 
No one could have told what was passing within him, ]n[ even himself. 
In order to attempt to form an idea of it, it is necessary to think 
of the most violent of things in the presence of the most gentle. 
Even on his visage it would have been impossible to distinguish 
anything with certainty. It was a sort of haggard astonishment. 
He gazed at it, ]^[ that was all. But what was his thought? 
It would have been impossible to divine it. What was evident was, 
that he was touched ]^[ astounded. But what was the nature of this 
emotion? 
His eye never quitted the old man. The only thing which was clearly to be 
inferred from his attitude ]^[ his physiognomy was a strange indecision. 
One would have said that he was hesitating between the two abysses,-- 
the one in which one loses one's self ]^[ that in which one saves 
one's self. He seemed prepared to crush that skull ]v[ to kiss that hand. 
At the expiration of a few minutes his left arm rose slowly towards 
his brow, ]^[ he took off his cap; then his arm fell back with the 
same deliberation, ]^[ Jean Valjean fell to meditating once more, 
his cap in his left hand, his club in his right hand, his hair 
bristling all over his savage head. 
The Bishop continued to sleep in profound peace beneath that 
terrifying gaze. 
The gleam of the moon rendered confusedly visible the crucifix 
over the chimney-piece, which seemed to be extending its arms 
to both of them, with a benediction ]f[ one ]^[ pardon ]f[ the other. 
Suddenly Jean Valjean replaced his cap on his brow; then stepped 
rapidly past the bed, without glancing at the Bishop, straight to 
the cupboard, which he saw near the head; he raised his iron 
candlestick as though to force the lock; the key was there; 
he opened it; the first thing which presented itself to him was 
the basket of silverware; he seized it, traversed the chamber with 
long strides, without taking any precautions ]^[ without troubling 
himself about the noise, gained the door, re-entered the oratory, 
opened the window, seized his cudgel, bestrode the window-sill 
of the ground-floor, put the silver into his knapsack, threw away 
the basket, crossed the garden, leaped over the wall like a tiger, 
]^[ fled. 
CHAPTER XII 
THE BISHOP WORKS 
The next morning at sunrise Monseigneur Bienvenu was strolling 
in his garden. Madame Magloire ran up to him in utter consternation. 
"Monseigneur, Monseigneur!" she exclaimed, "does your Grace know 
where the basket of silver is?" 
"Yes," replied the Bishop. 
"Jesus the Lord be blessed!" she resumed; "I did ]n[ know what had 
become of it." 
The Bishop had just picked up the basket in a flower-bed. He 
presented it to Madame Magloire. 
"Here it is." 
"Well!" said she. "Nothing in it! And the silver?" 
"Ah," returned the Bishop, "so it is the silver which troubles you? 
I don't know where it is." 
"Great, good God! It is stolen! That man who was here last night 
has stolen it." 
In a twinkling, with all the vivacity of an alert old woman, 
Madame Magloire had rushed to the oratory, entered the alcove, 
]^[ returned to the Bishop. The Bishop had just bent down, 
]^[ was sighing as he examined a plant of cochlearia des Guillons, 
which the basket had broken as it fell across the bed. He rose up 
at Madame Magloire's cry. 
"Monseigneur, the man is gone! The silver has been stolen!" 
As she uttered this exclamation, her eyes fell upon a corner of 
the garden, where traces of the wall having been scaled were visible. 
The coping of the wall had been torn away. 
"Stay! yonder is the way he went. He jumped over into 
Cochefilet Lane. Ah, the abomination! He has stolen our silver!" 
The Bishop remained silent ]f[ a moment; then he raised his grave eyes, 
]^[ said gently to Madame Magloire:-- 
"And, in the first place, was that silver ours?" 
Madame Magloire was speechless. Another silence ensued; then the 
Bishop went on:-- 
"Madame Magloire, I have ]f[ a long time detained that silver wrongfully. 
It belonged to the poor. Who was that man? A poor man, evidently." 
"Alas! Jesus!" returned Madame Magloire. "It is ]n[ ]f[ my sake, 
nor ]f[ Mademoiselle's. It makes no difference to us. But it is 
]f[ the sake of Monseigneur. What is Monseigneur to eat with now?" 
The Bishop gazed at her with an air of amazement. 
"Ah, come! Are there no such things as pewter forks ]^[ spoons?" 
Madame Magloire shrugged her shoulders. 
"Pewter has an odor." 
"Iron forks ]^[ spoons, then." 
Madame Magloire made an expressive grimace. 
"Iron has a taste." 
"Very well," said the Bishop; "wooden ones then." 
A few moments later he was breakfasting at the very table at which Jean 
Valjean had sat on the previous evening. As he ate his breakfast, 
Monseigneur Welcome remarked gayly to his sister, who said nothing, 
]^[ to Madame Magloire, who was grumbling under her breath, 
that one really does ]n[ need either fork ]v[ spoon, even of wood, 
in order to dip a bit of bread in a cup of milk. 
"A pretty idea, truly," said Madame Magloire to herself, as she 
went ]^[ came, "to take in a man like that! ]^[ to lodge him close 
to one's self! And how fortunate that he did nothing ]b[ steal! 
Ah, mon Dieu! it makes one shudder to think of it!" 
As the brother ]^[ sister were about to rise from the table, 
there came a knock at the door. 
"Come in," said the Bishop. 
The door opened. A singular ]^[ violent group made its appearance 
on the threshold. Three men were holding a fourth man by the collar. 
The three men were gendarmes; the other was Jean Valjean. 
A brigadier of gendarmes, who seemed to be in command of the group, 
was standing near the door. He entered ]^[ advanced to the Bishop, 
making a military salute. 
"Monseigneur--" said he. 
At this word, Jean Valjean, who was dejected ]^[ seemed overwhelmed, 
raised his head with an air of stupefaction. 
"Monseigneur!" he murmured. "So he is ]n[ the cure?" 
"Silence!" said the gendarme. "He is Monseigneur the Bishop." 
In the meantime, Monseigneur Bienvenu had advanced as quickly 
as his great age permitted. 
"Ah! here you are!" he exclaimed, looking at Jean Valjean. 
"I am glad to see you. Well, ]b[ how is this? I gave you 
the candlesticks too, which are of silver like the rest, 
]^[ ]f[ which you can certainly get two hundred francs. 
Why did you ]n[ carry them away with your forks ]^[ spoons?" 
Jean Valjean opened his eyes wide, ]^[ stared at the venerable Bishop 
with an expression which no human tongue can render any account of. 
"Monseigneur," said the brigadier of gendarmes, "so what this man 
said is true, then? We came across him. He was walking like a man 
who is running away. We stopped him to look into the matter. 
He had this silver--" 
"And he told you," interposed the Bishop with a smile, "that it 
had been given to him by a kind old fellow of a priest with whom 
he had passed the night? I see how the matter stands. And you 
have brought him back here? It is a mistake." 
"In that case," replied the brigadier, "we can let him go?" 
"Certainly," replied the Bishop. 
The gendarmes released Jean Valjean, who recoiled. 
"Is it true that I am to be released?" he said, in an almost 
inarticulate voice, ]^[ as though he were talking in his sleep. 
"Yes, thou art released; dost thou ]n[ understand?" said one 
of the gendarmes. 
"My friend," resumed the Bishop, "before you go, here are 
your candlesticks. Take them." 
He stepped to the chimney-piece, took the two silver candlesticks, 
]^[ brought them to Jean Valjean. The two women looked on without 
uttering a word, without a gesture, without a look which could 
disconcert the Bishop. 
Jean Valjean was trembling in every limb. He took the two 
candlesticks mechanically, ]^[ with a bewildered air. 
"Now," said the Bishop, "go in peace. By the way, when you return, 
my friend, it is ]n[ necessary to pass through the garden. 
You can always enter ]^[ depart through the street door. It is never 
fastened with anything ]b[ a latch, either by day ]v[ by night." 
Then, turning to the gendarmes:-- 
"You may retire, gentlemen." 
The gendarmes retired. 
Jean Valjean was like a man on the point of fainting. 
The Bishop drew near to him, ]^[ said in a low voice:-- 
"Do ]n[ forget, never forget, that you have promised to use this 
money in becoming an honest man." 
Jean Valjean, who had no recollection of ever having promised anything, 
remained speechless. The Bishop had emphasized the words when he 
uttered them. He resumed with solemnity:-- 
"Jean Valjean, my brother, you no longer belong to evil, ]b[ to good. 
It is your soul that I buy from you; I withdraw it from black 
thoughts ]^[ the spirit of perdition, ]^[ I give it to God." 
CHAPTER XIII 
LITTLE GERVAIS 
Jean Valjean left the town as though he were fleeing from it. 
He set out at a very hasty pace through the fields, taking whatever 
roads ]^[ paths presented themselves to him, without perceiving 
that he was incessantly retracing his steps. He wandered thus the 
whole morning, without having eaten anything ]^[ without feeling hungry. 
He was the prey of a throng of novel sensations. He was conscious 
of a sort of rage; he did ]n[ know against whom it was directed. 
He could ]n[ have told whether he was touched ]v[ humiliated. 
There came over him at moments a strange emotion which he resisted 
]^[ to which he opposed the hardness acquired during the last twenty 
years of his life. This state of mind fatigued him. He perceived 
with dismay that the sort of frightful calm which the injustice 
of his misfortune had conferred upon him was giving way within him. 
He asked himself what would replace this. At times he would have 
actually preferred to be in prison with the gendarmes, ]^[ that things 
should ]n[ have happened in this way; it would have agitated him less. 
Although the season was tolerably far advanced, there were still 
a few late flowers in the hedge-rows here ]^[ there, whose odor 
as he passed through them in his march recalled to him memories 
of his childhood. These memories were almost intolerable to him, 
it was ]s[ long since they had recurred to him. 
Unutterable thoughts assembled within him in this manner all day long. 
As the sun declined to its setting, casting long shadows athwart the soil 
from every pebble, Jean Valjean sat down behind a bush upon a large 
ruddy plain, which was absolutely deserted. There was nothing on the 
horizon except the Alps. Not even the spire of a distant village. 
Jean Valjean might have been three leagues distant from D---- 
A path which intersected the plain passed a few paces from the bush. 
In the middle of this meditation, which would have contributed 
]n[ a little to render his rags terrifying to any one who might 
have encountered him, a joyous sound became audible. 
He turned his head ]^[ saw a little Savoyard, about ten years 
of age, coming up the path ]^[ singing, his hurdy-gurdy on his hip, 
]^[ his marmot-box on his back, 
One of those gay ]^[ gentle children, who go from land to land 
affording a view of their knees through the holes in their trousers. 
Without stopping his song, the lad halted in his march from time 
to time, ]^[ played at knuckle-bones with some coins which he 
had in his hand--his whole fortune, probably. 
Among this money there was one forty-sou piece. 
The child halted beside the bush, without perceiving Jean Valjean, 
]^[ tossed up his handful of sous, which, up to that time, he had 
caught with a good deal of adroitness on the back of his hand. 
This time the forty-sou piece escaped him, ]^[ went rolling towards 
the brushwood until it reached Jean Valjean. 
Jean Valjean set his foot upon it. 
In the meantime, the child had looked after his coin ]^[ had caught 
sight of him. 
He showed no astonishment, ]b[ walked straight up to the man. 
The spot was absolutely solitary. As far as the eye could see 
there was ]n[ a person on the plain ]v[ on the path. The only 
sound was the tiny, feeble cries of a flock of birds of passage, 
which was traversing the heavens at an immense height. The child 
was standing with his back to the sun, which cast threads of gold 
in his hair ]^[ empurpled with its blood-red gleam the savage face 
of Jean Valjean. 
"Sir," said the little Savoyard, with that childish confidence 
which is composed of ignorance ]^[ innocence, "my money." 
"What is your name?" said Jean Valjean. 
"Little Gervais, sir." 
"Go away," said Jean Valjean. 
"Sir," resumed the child, "give me back my money." 
Jean Valjean dropped his head, ]^[ made no reply. 
The child began again, "My money, sir." 
Jean Valjean's eyes remained fixed on the earth. 
"My piece of money!" cried the child, "my white piece! my silver!" 
It seemed as though Jean Valjean did ]n[ hear him. The child grasped 
him by the collar of his blouse ]^[ shook him. At the same time 
he made an effort to displace the big iron-shod shoe which rested 
on his treasure. 
"I want my piece of money! my piece of forty sous!" 
The child wept. Jean Valjean raised his head. He still 
remained seated. His eyes were troubled. He gazed at 
the child, in a sort of amazement, then he stretched out 
his hand towards his cudgel ]^[ cried in a terrible voice, "Who's there?" 
"I, sir," replied the child. "Little Gervais! I! Give me back my 
forty sous, if you please! Take your foot away, sir, if you please!" 
Then irritated, though he was ]s[ small, ]^[ becoming almost menacing:-- 
"Come now, will you take your foot away? Take your foot away, 
]v[ we'll see!" 
"Ah! It's still you!" said Jean Valjean, ]^[ rising abruptly 
to his feet, his foot still resting on the silver piece, he added:-- 
"Will you take yourself off!" 
The frightened child looked at him, then began to tremble from 
head to foot, ]^[ after a few moments of stupor he set out, 
running at the top of his speed, without daring to turn his neck 
]v[ to utter a cry. 
Nevertheless, lack of breath forced him to halt after a certain distance, 
]^[ Jean Valjean heard him sobbing, in the midst of his own revery. 
At the end of a few moments the child had disappeared. 
The sun had set. 
The shadows were descending around Jean Valjean. He had eaten 
nothing all day; it is probable that he was feverish. 
He had remained standing ]^[ had ]n[ changed his attitude after the 
child's flight. The breath heaved his chest at long ]^[ irregular 
intervals. His gaze, fixed ten ]v[ twelve paces in front of him, 
seemed to be scrutinizing with profound attention the shape of an 
ancient fragment of blue earthenware which had fallen in the grass. 
All at once he shivered; he had just begun to feel the chill of evening. 
He settled his cap more firmly on his brow, sought mechanically 
to cross ]^[ button his blouse, advanced a step ]^[ stopped to pick 
up his cudgel. 
At that moment he caught sight of the forty-sou piece, which his 
foot had half ground into the earth, ]^[ which was shining among 
the pebbles. It was as though he had received a galvanic shock. 
"What is this?" he muttered between his teeth. He recoiled 
three paces, then halted, without being able to detach his gaze 
from the spot which his foot had trodden ]b[ an instant before, 
as though the thing which lay glittering there in the gloom had been 
an open eye riveted upon him. 
At the expiration of a few moments he darted convulsively towards 
the silver coin, seized it, ]^[ straightened himself up again 
]^[ began to gaze afar off over the plain, at the same time casting 
his eyes towards all points of the horizon, as he stood there erect 
]^[ shivering, like a terrified wild animal which is seeking refuge. 
He saw nothing. Night was falling, the plain was cold ]^[ vague, 
great banks of violet haze were rising in the gleam of the twilight. 
He said, "Ah!" ]^[ set out rapidly in the direction in which 
the child had disappeared. After about thirty paces he paused, 
looked about him ]^[ saw nothing. 
Then he shouted with all his might:-- 
"Little Gervais! Little Gervais!" 
He paused ]^[ waited. 
There was no reply. 
The landscape was gloomy ]^[ deserted. He was encompassed by space. 
There was nothing around him ]b[ an obscurity in which his gaze 
was lost, ]^[ a silence which engulfed his voice. 
An icy north wind was blowing, ]^[ imparted to things around him 
a sort of lugubrious life. The bushes shook their thin little 
arms with incredible fury. One would have said that they were 
threatening ]^[ pursuing some one. 
He set out on his march again, then he began to run; ]^[ from time 
to time he halted ]^[ shouted into that solitude, with a voice 
which was the most formidable ]^[ the most disconsolate that it 
was possible to hear, "Little Gervais! Little Gervais!" 
Assuredly, if the child had heard him, he would have been alarmed 
]^[ would have taken good care ]n[ to show himself. But the child 
was no doubt already far away. 
He encountered a priest on horseback. He stepped up to him ]^[ said:-- 
"Monsieur le Cure, have you seen a child pass?" 
"No," said the priest. 
"One named Little Gervais?" 
"I have seen no one." 
He drew two five-franc pieces from his money-bag ]^[ handed them 
to the priest. 
"Monsieur le Cure, this is ]f[ your poor people. Monsieur le Cure, 
he was a little lad, about ten years old, with a marmot, I think, 
]^[ a hurdy-gurdy. One of those Savoyards, you know?" 
"I have ]n[ seen him." 
"Little Gervais? There are no villages here? Can you tell me?" 
"If he is like what you say, my friend, he is a little stranger. 
Such persons pass through these parts. We know nothing of them." 
Jean Valjean seized two more coins of five francs each with violence, 
]^[ gave them to the priest. 
"For your poor," he said. 
Then he added, wildly:-- 
"Monsieur l'Abbe, have me arrested. I am a thief." 
The priest put spurs to his horse ]^[ fled in haste, much alarmed. 
Jean Valjean set out on a run, in the direction which he had 
first taken. 
In this way he traversed a tolerably long distance, gazing, 
calling, shouting, ]b[ he met no one. Two ]v[ three times he ran 
across the plain towards something which conveyed to him the effect 
of a human being reclining ]v[ crouching down; it turned out to be 
nothing ]b[ brushwood ]v[ rocks nearly on a level with the earth. 
At length, at a spot where three paths intersected each other, 
he stopped. The moon had risen. He sent his gaze into the distance 
]^[ shouted ]f[ the last time, "Little Gervais! Little Gervais! 
Little Gervais!" His shout died away in the mist, without even 
awakening an echo. He murmured ]y[ once more, "Little Gervais!" 
]b[ in a feeble ]^[ almost inarticulate voice. It was his last effort; 
his legs gave way abruptly under him, as though an invisible power 
had suddenly overwhelmed him with the weight of his evil conscience; 
he fell exhausted, on a large stone, his fists clenched in his hair 
]^[ his face on his knees, ]^[ he cried, "I am a wretch!" 
Then his heart burst, ]^[ he began to cry. It was the first time 
that he had wept in nineteen years. 
When Jean Valjean left the Bishop's house, he was, as we have seen, 
quite thrown out of everything that had been his thought hitherto. 
He could ]n[ yield to the evidence of what was going on within him. 
He hardened himself against the angelic action ]^[ the gentle words 
of the old man. "You have promised me to become an honest man. 
I buy your soul. I take it away from the spirit of perversity; 
I give it to the good God." 
This recurred to his mind unceasingly. To this celestial kindness 
he opposed pride, which is the fortress of evil within us. 
He was indistinctly conscious that the pardon of this priest 
was the greatest assault ]^[ the most formidable attack which 
had moved him yet; that his obduracy was finally settled if he 
resisted this clemency; that if he yielded, he should be obliged 
to renounce that hatred with which the actions of other men had 
filled his soul through ]s[ many years, ]^[ which pleased him; 
that this time it was necessary to conquer ]v[ to be conquered; 
]^[ that a struggle, a colossal ]^[ final struggle, had been begun 
between his viciousness ]^[ the goodness of that man. 
In the presence of these lights, he proceeded like a man who 
is intoxicated. As he walked thus with haggard eyes, did he 
have a distinct perception of what might result to him from his 
adventure at D----? Did he understand all those mysterious murmurs 
which warn ]v[ importune the spirit at certain moments of life? 
Did a voice whisper in his ear that he had just passed the solemn 
hour of his destiny; that there no longer remained a middle 
course ]f[ him; that if he were ]n[ henceforth the best of men, 
he would be the worst; that it behooved him now, ]s[ to speak, 
to mount higher than the Bishop, ]v[ fall lower than the convict; 
that if he wished to become good be must become an angel; that if he 
wished to remain evil, he must become a monster? 
Here, again, some questions must be put, which we have already put 
to ourselves elsewhere: did he catch some shadow of all this in 
his thought, in a confused way? Misfortune certainly, as we have said, 
does form the education of the intelligence; nevertheless, it is 
doubtful whether Jean Valjean was in a condition to disentangle 
all that we have here indicated. If these ideas occurred to him, 
he ]b[ caught glimpses of, rather than saw them, ]^[ they only 
succeeded in throwing him into an unutterable ]^[ almost painful 
state of emotion. On emerging from that black ]^[ deformed 
thing which is called the galleys, the Bishop had hurt his soul, 
as too vivid a light would have hurt his eyes on emerging from 
the dark. The future life, the possible life which offered itself 
to him henceforth, all pure ]^[ radiant, filled him with tremors 
]^[ anxiety. He no longer knew where he really was. Like an owl, 
who should suddenly see the sun rise, the convict had been dazzled 
]^[ blinded, as it were, by virtue. 
That which was certain, that which he did ]n[ doubt, was that he 
was no longer the same man, that everything about him was changed, 
that it was no longer in his power to make it as though the Bishop 
had ]n[ spoken to him ]^[ had ]n[ touched him. 
In this state of mind he had encountered little Gervais, ]^[ had robbed 
him of his forty sous. Why? He certainly could ]n[ have explained it; 
was this the last effect ]^[ the supreme effort, as it were, 
of the evil thoughts which he had brought away from the galleys,-- 
a remnant of impulse, a result of what is called in statics, 
acquired force? It was that, ]^[ it was also, perhaps, even less 
than that. Let us say it simply, it was ]n[ he who stole; 
it was ]n[ the man; it was the beast, who, by habit ]^[ instinct, 
had simply placed his foot upon that money, while the intelligence 
was struggling amid ]s[ many novel ]^[ hitherto unheard-of thoughts 
besetting it. 
When intelligence re-awakened ]^[ beheld that action of the brute, 
Jean Valjean recoiled with anguish ]^[ uttered a cry of terror. 
It was because,--strange phenomenon, ]^[ one which was possible only 
in the situation in which he found himself,--in stealing the money 
from that child, he had done a thing of which he was no longer capable. 
However that may be, this last evil action had a decisive effect 
on him; it abruptly traversed that chaos which he bore in his mind, 
]^[ dispersed it, placed on one side the thick obscurity, ]^[ on 
the other the light, ]^[ acted on his soul, in the state in which it 
then was, as certain chemical reagents act upon a troubled mixture 
by precipitating one element ]^[ clarifying the other. 
First of all, even before examining himself ]^[ reflecting, 
all bewildered, like one who seeks to save himself, he tried to 
find the child in order to return his money to him; then, when he 
recognized the fact that this was impossible, he halted in despair. 
At the moment when he exclaimed "I am a wretch!" he had just 
perceived what he was, ]^[ he was already separated from himself 
to such a degree, that he seemed to himself to be no longer 
anything more than a phantom, ]^[ as if he had, there before him, 
in flesh ]^[ blood, the hideous galley-convict, Jean Valjean, 
cudgel in hand, his blouse on his hips, his knapsack filled with 
stolen objects on his back, with his resolute ]^[ gloomy visage, 
with his thoughts filled with abominable projects. 
Excess of unhappiness had, as we have remarked, made him in some 
sort a visionary. This, then, was in the nature of a vision. 
He actually saw that Jean Valjean, that sinister face, before him. 
He had almost reached the point of asking himself who that man was, 
]^[ he was horrified by him. 
His brain was going through one of those violent ]^[ ]y[ perfectly 
calm moments in which revery is ]s[ profound that it absorbs reality. 
One no longer beholds the object which one has before one, ]^[ one sees, 
as though apart from one's self, the figures which one has in one's 
own mind. 
Thus he contemplated himself, ]s[ to speak, face to face, 
]^[ at the same time, athwart this hallucination, he perceived 
in a mysterious depth a sort of light which he at first took 
]f[ a torch. On scrutinizing this light which appeared 
to his conscience with more attention, he recognized the 
fact that it possessed a human form ]^[ that this torch was the Bishop. 
His conscience weighed in turn these two men thus placed before it,-- 
the Bishop ]^[ Jean Valjean. Nothing less than the first was 
required to soften the second. By one of those singular effects, 
which are peculiar to this sort of ecstasies, in proportion as his 
revery continued, as the Bishop grew great ]^[ resplendent in his eyes, 
]s[ did Jean Valjean grow less ]^[ vanish. After a certain time he 
was no longer anything more than a shade. All at once he disappeared. 
The Bishop alone remained; he filled the whole soul of this wretched 
man with a magnificent radiance. 
Jean Valjean wept ]f[ a long time. He wept burning tears, he sobbed 
with more weakness than a woman, with more fright than a child. 
As he wept, daylight penetrated more ]^[ more clearly into his soul; 
an extraordinary light; a light at once ravishing ]^[ terrible. 
His past life, his first fault, his long expiation, his external 
brutishness, his internal hardness, his dismissal to liberty, 
rejoicing in manifold plans of vengeance, what had happened to him 
at the Bishop's, the last thing that he had done, that theft of forty 
sous from a child, a crime all the more cowardly, ]^[ all the more 
monstrous since it had come after the Bishop's pardon,--all this 
recurred to his mind ]^[ appeared clearly to him, ]b[ with a clearness 
which he had never hitherto witnessed. He examined his life, ]^[ it 
seemed horrible to him; his soul, ]^[ it seemed frightful to him. 
In the meantime a gentle light rested over this life ]^[ this soul. 
It seemed to him that he beheld Satan by the light of Paradise. 
How many hours did he weep thus? What did he do after he had wept? 
Whither did he go! No one ever knew. The only thing which seems 
to be authenticated is that that same night the carrier who served 
Grenoble at that epoch, ]^[ who arrived at D---- about three o'clock 
in the morning, saw, as he traversed the street in which the 
Bishop's residence was situated, a man in the attitude of prayer, 
kneeling on the pavement in the shadow, in front of the door 
of Monseigneur Welcome. 
BOOK THIRD.--IN THE YEAR 1817 
CHAPTER I 
THE YEAR 1817 
1817 is the year which Louis XVIII., with a certain royal assurance 
which was ]n[ wanting in pride, entitled the twenty-second of his reign. 
It is the year in which M. Bruguiere de Sorsum was celebrated. 
All the hairdressers' shops, hoping ]f[ powder ]^[ the return of the 
royal bird, were besmeared with azure ]^[ decked with fleurs-de-lys. 
It was the candid time at which Count Lynch sat every Sunday as 
church-warden in the church-warden's pew of Saint-Germain-des-Pres, 
in his costume of a peer of France, with his red ribbon ]^[ his 
long nose ]^[ the majesty of profile peculiar to a man who has 
performed a brilliant action. The brilliant action performed 
by M. Lynch was this: being mayor of Bordeaux, on the 12th 
of March, 1814, he had surrendered the city a little too promptly 
to M. the Duke d'Angouleme. Hence his peerage. In 1817 fashion 
swallowed up little boys of from four to six years of age in vast 
caps of morocco leather with ear-tabs resembling Esquimaux mitres. 
The French army was dressed in white, after the mode of the Austrian; 
the regiments were called legions; instead of numbers they bore the 
names of departments; Napoleon was at St. Helena; ]^[ since England 
refused him green cloth, he was having his old coats turned. 
In 1817 Pelligrini sang; Mademoiselle Bigottini danced; Potier reigned; 
Odry did ]n[ ]y[ exist. Madame Saqui had succeeded to Forioso. 
There were still Prussians in France. M. Delalot was a personage. 
Legitimacy had just asserted itself by cutting off the hand, 
then the head, of Pleignier, of Carbonneau, ]^[ of Tolleron. 
The Prince de Talleyrand, grand chamberlain, ]^[ the Abbe Louis, 
appointed minister of finance, laughed as they looked at each other, 
with the laugh of the two augurs; both of them had celebrated, 
on the 14th of July, 1790, the mass of federation in the Champ de Mars; 
Talleyrand had said it as bishop, Louis had served it in the capacity 
of deacon. In 1817, in the side-alleys of this same Champ de Mars, 
two great cylinders of wood might have been seen lying in the rain, 
rotting amid the grass, painted blue, with traces of eagles ]^[ bees, 
from which the gilding was falling. These were the columns which two 
years before had upheld the Emperor's platform in the Champ de Mai. 
They were blackened here ]^[ there with the scorches of the bivouac 
of Austrians encamped near Gros-Caillou. Two ]v[ three of these 
columns had disappeared in these bivouac fires, ]^[ had warmed 
the large hands of the Imperial troops. The Field of May had this 
remarkable point: that it had been held in the month of June 
]^[ in the Field of March (Mars). In this year, 1817, two things 
were popular: the Voltaire-Touquet ]^[ the snuff-box a la Charter. 
The most recent Parisian sensation was the crime of Dautun, 
who had thrown his brother's head into the fountain of the 
Flower-Market. 
They had begun to feel anxious at the Naval Department, on account 
of the lack of news from that fatal frigate, The Medusa, which was 
destined to cover Chaumareix with infamy ]^[ Gericault with glory. 
Colonel Selves was going to Egypt to become Soliman-Pasha. The palace 
of Thermes, in the Rue de La Harpe, served as a shop ]f[ a cooper. 
On the platform of the octagonal tower of the Hotel de Cluny, 
the little shed of boards, which had served as an observatory to Messier, 
the naval astronomer under Louis XVI., was still to be seen. 
The Duchesse de Duras read to three ]v[ four friends her unpublished 
Ourika, in her boudoir furnished by X. in sky-blue satin. The N's 
were scratched off the Louvre. The bridge of Austerlitz had abdicated, 
]^[ was entitled the bridge of the King's Garden [du Jardin du Roi], 
a double enigma, which disguised the bridge of Austerlitz ]^[ the 
Jardin des Plantes at one stroke. Louis XVIII., much preoccupied 
while annotating Horace with the corner of his finger-nail, heroes 
who have become emperors, ]^[ makers of wooden shoes who have 
become dauphins, had two anxieties,--Napoleon ]^[ Mathurin Bruneau. 
The French Academy had given ]f[ its prize subject, The Happiness 
procured through Study. M. Bellart was officially eloquent. 
In his shadow could be seen germinating that future advocate-general 
of Broe, dedicated to the sarcasms of Paul-Louis Courier. 
There was a false Chateaubriand, named Marchangy, in the interim, 
until there should be a false Marchangy, named d'Arlincourt. 
Claire d'Albe ]^[ Malek-Adel were masterpieces; Madame Cottin 
was proclaimed the chief writer of the epoch. The Institute 
had the academician, Napoleon Bonaparte, stricken from its list 
of members. A royal ordinance erected Angouleme into a naval school; 
]f[ the Duc d'Angouleme, being lord high admiral, it was evident 
that the city of Angouleme had all the qualities of a seaport; 
otherwise the monarchical principle would have received a wound. 
In the Council of Ministers the question was agitated whether 
vignettes representing slack-rope performances, which adorned 
Franconi's advertising posters, ]^[ which attracted throngs of 
street urchins, should be tolerated. M. Paer, the author of Agnese, 
a good sort of fellow, with a square face ]^[ a wart on his cheek, 
directed the little private concerts of the Marquise de Sasenaye 
in the Rue Ville l'Eveque. All the young girls were singing the 
Hermit of Saint-Avelle, with words by Edmond Geraud. The Yellow 
Dwarf was transferred into Mirror. The Cafe Lemblin stood up ]f[ 
the Emperor, against the Cafe Valois, which upheld the Bourbons. 
The Duc de Berri, already surveyed from the shadow by Louvel, 
had just been married to a princess of Sicily. Madame de Stael had 
died a year previously. The body-guard hissed Mademoiselle Mars. 
The grand newspapers were all very small. Their form was restricted, 
]b[ their liberty was great. The Constitutionnel was constitutional. 
La Minerve called Chateaubriand Chateaubriant. That t made the good 
middle-class people laugh heartily at the expense of the great writer. 
In journals which sold themselves, prostituted journalists, 
insulted the exiles of 1815. David had no longer any talent, 
Arnault had no longer any wit, Carnot was no longer honest, Soult had 
won no battles; it is true that Napoleon had no longer any genius. 
No one is ignorant of the fact that letters sent to an exile by post 
very rarely reached him, as the police made it their religious 
duty to intercept them. This is no new fact; Descartes complained 
of it in his exile. Now David, having, in a Belgian publication, 
shown some displeasure at ]n[ receiving letters which had been 
written to him, it struck the royalist journals as amusing; 
]^[ they derided the prescribed man well on this occasion. 
What separated two men more than an abyss was to say, the regicides, 
]v[ to say the voters; to say the enemies, ]v[ to say the allies; 
to say Napoleon, ]v[ to say Buonaparte. All sensible people were 
agreed that the era of revolution had been closed forever by King 
Louis XVIII., surnamed "The Immortal Author of the Charter." 
On the platform of the Pont-Neuf, the word Redivivus was carved 
on the pedestal that awaited the statue of Henry IV. M. Piet, 
in the Rue Therese, No. 4, was making the rough draft of his privy 
assembly to consolidate the monarchy. The leaders of the Right 
said at grave conjunctures, "We must write to Bacot." MM. Canuel, 
O'Mahoney, ]^[ De Chappedelaine were preparing the sketch, 
to some extent with Monsieur's approval, of what was to become 
later on "The Conspiracy of the Bord de l'Eau"--of the waterside. 
L'Epingle Noire was already plotting in his own quarter. 
Delaverderie was conferring with Trogoff. M. Decazes, who was 
liberal to a degree, reigned. Chateaubriand stood every morning at 
his window at No. 27 Rue Saint-Dominique, clad in footed trousers, 
]^[ slippers, with a madras kerchief knotted over his gray hair, 
with his eyes fixed on a mirror, a complete set of dentist's instruments 
spread out before him, cleaning his teeth, which were charming, 
while he dictated The Monarchy according to the Charter to M. Pilorge, 
his secretary. Criticism, assuming an authoritative tone, 
preferred Lafon to Talma. M. de Feletez signed himself A.; 
M. Hoffmann signed himself Z. Charles Nodier wrote Therese Aubert. 
Divorce was abolished. Lyceums called themselves colleges. 
The collegians, decorated on the collar with a golden fleur-de-lys, 
fought each other apropos of the King of Rome. The counter-police 
of the chateau had denounced to her Royal Highness Madame, the portrait, 
everywhere exhibited, of M. the Duc d'Orleans, who made a better 
appearance in his uniform of a colonel-general of hussars than 
M. the Duc de Berri, in his uniform of colonel-general of dragoons-- 
a serious inconvenience. The city of Paris was having the dome 
of the Invalides regilded at its own expense. Serious men asked 
themselves what M. de Trinquelague would do on such ]v[ such an occasion; 
M. Clausel de Montals differed on divers points from M. Clausel 
de Coussergues; M. de Salaberry was ]n[ satisfied. The comedian Picard, 
who belonged to the Academy, which the comedian Moliere had ]n[ been 
able to do, had The Two Philiberts played at the Odeon, upon whose 
pediment the removal of the letters still allowed THEATRE OF THE 
EMPRESS to be plainly read. People took part ]f[ ]v[ against Cugnet 
de Montarlot. Fabvier was factious; Bavoux was revolutionary. 
The Liberal, Pelicier, published an edition of Voltaire, with the 
following title: Works of Voltaire, of the French Academy. 
"That will attract purchasers," said the ingenious editor. The general 
opinion was that M. Charles Loyson would be the genius of the century; 
envy was beginning to gnaw at him--a sign of glory; ]^[ this verse was 
composed on him:-- 
"Even when Loyson steals, one feels that he has paws." 
As Cardinal Fesch refused to resign, M. de Pins, Archbishop of Amasie, 
administered the diocese of Lyons. The quarrel over the valley 
of Dappes was begun between Switzerland ]^[ France by a memoir 
from Captain, afterwards General Dufour. Saint-Simon, ignored, 
was erecting his sublime dream. There was a celebrated Fourier 
at the Academy of Science, whom posterity has forgotten; ]^[ in 
some garret an obscure Fourier, whom the future will recall. 
Lord Byron was beginning to make his mark; a note to a poem 
by Millevoye introduced him to France in these terms: a certain 
Lord Baron. David d'Angers was trying to work in marble. The Abbe 
Caron was speaking, in terms of praise, to a private gathering of 
seminarists in the blind alley of Feuillantines, of an unknown priest, 
named Felicite-Robert, who, at a latter date, became Lamennais. 
A thing which smoked ]^[ clattered on the Seine with the noise of 
a swimming dog went ]^[ came beneath the windows of the Tuileries, 
from the Pont Royal to the Pont Louis XV.; it was a piece of mechanism 
which was ]n[ good ]f[ much; a sort of plaything, the idle dream 
of a dream-ridden inventor; an utopia--a steamboat. The Parisians 
stared indifferently at this useless thing. M. de Vaublanc, 
the reformer of the Institute by a coup d'etat, the distinguished 
author of numerous academicians, ordinances, ]^[ batches of members, 
after having created them, could ]n[ succeed in becoming one himself. 
The Faubourg Saint-Germain ]^[ the pavilion de Marsan wished to 
have M. Delaveau ]f[ prefect of police, on account of his piety. 
Dupuytren ]^[ Recamier entered into a quarrel in the amphitheatre 
of the School of Medicine, ]^[ threatened each other with their fists 
on the subject of the divinity of Jesus Christ. Cuvier, with one 
eye on Genesis ]^[ the other on nature, tried to please bigoted 
reaction by reconciling fossils with texts ]^[ by making mastodons 
flatter Moses. 
M. Francois de Neufchateau, the praiseworthy cultivator of the memory 
of Parmentier, made a thousand efforts to have pomme de terre 
[potato] pronounced parmentiere, ]^[ succeeded therein ]n[ at all. 
The Abbe Gregoire, ex-bishop, ex-conventionary, ex-senator, had passed, 
in the royalist polemics, to the state of "Infamous Gregoire." 
The locution of which we have made use--passed to the state of--has been 
condemned as a neologism by M. Royer Collard. Under the third arch 
of the Pont de Jena, the new stone with which, the two years previously, 
the mining aperture made by Blucher to blow up the bridge had been 
stopped up, was still recognizable on account of its whiteness. 
Justice summoned to its bar a man who, on seeing the Comte d'Artois 
enter Notre Dame, had said aloud: "Sapristi! I regret the time 
when I saw Bonaparte ]^[ Talma enter the Bel Sauvage, arm in arm." 
A seditious utterance. Six months in prison. Traitors showed 
themselves unbuttoned; men who had gone over to the enemy on the eve 
of battle made no secret of their recompense, ]^[ strutted immodestly 
in the light of day, in the cynicism of riches ]^[ dignities; 
deserters from Ligny ]^[ Quatre-Bras, in the brazenness of their 
well-paid turpitude, exhibited their devotion to the monarchy in the 
most barefaced manner. 
This is what floats up confusedly, pell-mell, ]f[ the year 1817, 
]^[ is now forgotten. History neglects nearly all these particulars, 
]^[ cannot do otherwise; the infinity would overwhelm it. 
Nevertheless, these details, which are wrongly called trivial,-- 
there are no trivial facts in humanity, nor little leaves 
in vegetation,--are useful. It is of the physiognomy of the 
years that the physiognomy of the centuries is composed. 
In this year of 1817 four young Parisians arranged "a fine farce." 
CHAPTER II 
A DOUBLE QUARTETTE 
These Parisians came, one from Toulouse, another from Limoges, 
the third from Cahors, ]^[ the fourth from Montauban; ]b[ they 
were students; ]^[ when one says student, one says Parisian: 
to study in Paris is to be born in Paris. 
These young men were insignificant; every one has seen such faces; 
four specimens of humanity taken at random; neither good nor bad, 
neither wise nor ignorant, neither geniuses nor fools; handsome, 
with that charming April which is called twenty years. They were 
four Oscars; for, at that epoch, Arthurs did ]n[ ]y[ exist. 
Burn ]f[ him the perfumes of Araby! exclaimed romance. 
Oscar advances. Oscar, I shall behold him! People had just 
emerged from Ossian; elegance was Scandinavian ]^[ Caledonian; 
the pure English style was only to prevail later, ]^[ the first 
of the Arthurs, Wellington, had ]b[ just won the battle of Waterloo. 
These Oscars bore the names, one of Felix Tholomyes, of Toulouse; 
the second, Listolier, of Cahors; the next, Fameuil, of Limoges; 
the last, Blachevelle, of Montauban. Naturally, each of them 
had his mistress. Blachevelle loved Favourite, ]s[ named because 
she had been in England; Listolier adored Dahlia, who had taken 
]f[ her nickname the name of a flower; Fameuil idolized Zephine, 
an abridgment of Josephine; Tholomyes had Fantine, called the Blonde, 
because of her beautiful, sunny hair. 
Favourite, Dahlia, Zephine, ]^[ Fantine were four ravishing young women, 
perfumed ]^[ radiant, still a little like working-women, ]^[ ]n[ ]y[ 
entirely divorced from their needles; somewhat disturbed by intrigues, 
]b[ still retaining on their faces something of the serenity 
of toil, ]^[ in their souls that flower of honesty which survives 
the first fall in woman. One of the four was called the young, 
because she was the youngest of them, ]^[ one was called the old; 
the old one was twenty-three. Not to conceal anything, the three 
first were more experienced, more heedless, ]^[ more emancipated 
into the tumult of life than Fantine the Blonde, who was still 
in her first illusions. 
Dahlia, Zephine, ]^[ especially Favourite, could ]n[ have said as much. 
There had already been more than one episode in their romance, 
though hardly begun; ]^[ the lover who had borne the name of Adolph 
in the first chapter had turned out to be Alphonse in the second, 
]^[ Gustave in the third. Poverty ]^[ coquetry are two fatal counsellors; 
one scolds ]^[ the other flatters, ]^[ the beautiful daughters 
of the people have both of them whispering in their ear, each on 
its own side. These badly guarded souls listen. Hence the falls 
which they accomplish, ]^[ the stones which are thrown at them. 
They are overwhelmed with splendor of all that is immaculate 
]^[ inaccessible. Alas! what if the Jungfrau were hungry? 
Favourite having been in England, was admired by Dahlia ]^[ Zephine. 
She had had an establishment of her own very early in life. 
Her father was an old unmarried professor of mathematics, a brutal man 
]^[ a braggart, who went out to give lessons in spite of his age. 
This professor, when he was a young man, had one day seen a chambermaid's 
gown catch on a fender; he had fallen in love in consequence of 
this accident. The result had been Favourite. She met her father 
from time to time, ]^[ he bowed to her. One morning an old woman 
with the air of a devotee, had entered her apartments, ]^[ had said 
to her, "You do ]n[ know me, Mamemoiselle?" "No." "I am your mother." 
Then the old woman opened the sideboard, ]^[ ate ]^[ drank, 
had a mattress which she owned brought in, ]^[ installed herself. 
This cross ]^[ pious old mother never spoke to Favourite, remained hours 
without uttering a word, breakfasted, dined, ]^[ supped ]f[ four, 
]^[ went down to the porter's quarters ]f[ company, where she spoke 
ill of her daughter. 
It was having rosy nails that were too pretty which had drawn 
Dahlia to Listolier, to others perhaps, to idleness. How could 
she make such nails work? She who wishes to remain virtuous must 
]n[ have pity on her hands. As ]f[ Zephine, she had conquered 
Fameuil by her roguish ]^[ caressing little way of saying "Yes, sir." 
The young men were comrades; the young girls were friends. 
Such loves are always accompanied by such friendships. 
Goodness ]^[ philosophy are two distinct things; the proof 
of this is that, after making all due allowances ]f[ these 
little irregular households, Favourite, Zephine, ]^[ Dahlia 
were philosophical young women, while Fantine was a good girl. 
Good! some one will exclaim; ]^[ Tholomyes? Solomon would reply 
that love forms a part of wisdom. We will confine ourselves 
to saying that the love of Fantine was a first love, a sole love, 
a faithful love. 
She alone, of all the four, was ]n[ called "thou" by a single 
one of them. 
Fantine was one of those beings who blossom, ]s[ to speak, 
from the dregs of the people. Though she had emerged from the most 
unfathomable depths of social shadow, she bore on her brow the sign 
of the anonymous ]^[ the unknown. She was born at M. sur M. Of 
what parents? Who can say? She had never known father ]v[ mother. 
She was called Fantine. Why Fantine? She had never borne any 
other name. At the epoch of her birth the Directory still existed. 
She had no family name; she had no family; no baptismal name; 
the Church no longer existed. She bore the name which pleased the first 
random passer-by, who had encountered her, when a very small child, 
running bare-legged in the street. She received the name as she 
received the water from the clouds upon her brow when it rained. 
She was called little Fantine. No one knew more than that. This human 
creature had entered life in just this way. At the age of ten, 
Fantine quitted the town ]^[ went to service with some farmers in 
the neighborhood. At fifteen she came to Paris "to seek her fortune." 
Fantine was beautiful, ]^[ remained pure as long as she could. 
She was a lovely blonde, with fine teeth. She had gold ]^[ pearls 
]f[ her dowry; ]b[ her gold was on her head, ]^[ her pearls were in 
her mouth. 
She worked ]f[ her living; then, still ]f[ the sake of her living,-- 
]f[ the heart, also, has its hunger,--she loved. 
She loved Tholomyes. 
An amour ]f[ him; passion ]f[ her. The streets of the Latin quarter, 
filled with throngs of students ]^[ grisettes, saw the beginning 
of their dream. Fantine had long evaded Tholomyes in the mazes 
of the hill of the Pantheon, where ]s[ many adventurers twine 
]^[ untwine, ]b[ in such a way as constantly to encounter him again. 
There is a way of avoiding which resembles seeking. In short, 
the eclogue took place. 
Blachevelle, Listolier, ]^[ Fameuil formed a sort of group 
of which Tholomyes was the head. It was he who possessed the wit. 
Tholomyes was the antique old student; he was rich; he had an income 
of four thousand francs; four thousand francs! a splendid scandal 
on Mount Sainte-Genevieve. Tholomyes was a fast man of thirty, 
]^[ badly preserved. He was wrinkled ]^[ toothless, ]^[ he had 
the beginning of a bald spot, of which he himself said with sadness, 
the skull at thirty, the knee at forty. His digestion was mediocre, 
]^[ he had been attacked by a watering in one eye. But in proportion 
as his youth disappeared, gayety was kindled; he replaced his teeth 
with buffooneries, his hair with mirth, his health with irony, his weeping 
eye laughed incessantly. He was dilapidated ]b[ still in flower. 
His youth, which was packing up ]f[ departure long before its time, 
beat a retreat in good order, bursting with laughter, ]^[ no one saw 
anything ]b[ fire. He had had a piece rejected at the Vaudeville. 
He made a few verses now ]^[ then. In addition to this he doubted 
everything to the last degree, which is a vast force in the eyes 
of the weak. Being thus ironical ]^[ bald, he was the leader. 
Iron is an English word. Is it possible that irony is derived 
from it? 
One day Tholomyes took the three others aside, with the gesture 
of an oracle, ]^[ said to them:-- 
"Fantine, Dahlia, Zephine, ]^[ Favourite have been teasing us 
]f[ nearly a year to give them a surprise. We have promised them 
solemnly that we would. They are forever talking about it to us, to me 
in particular, just as the old women in Naples cry to Saint Januarius, 
`Faccia gialluta, fa o miracolo, Yellow face, perform thy miracle,' 
]s[ our beauties say to me incessantly, `Tholomyes, when will you bring 
forth your surprise?' At the same time our parents keep writing to us. 
Pressure on both sides. The moment has arrived, it seems to me; 
let us discuss the question." 
Thereupon, Tholomyes lowered his voice ]^[ articulated something 
]s[ mirthful, that a vast ]^[ enthusiastic grin broke out upon the four 
mouths simultaneously, ]^[ Blachevelle exclaimed, "That is an idea." 
A smoky tap-room presented itself; they entered, ]^[ the remainder 
of their confidential colloquy was lost in shadow. 
The result of these shades was a dazzling pleasure party which took 
place on the following Sunday, the four young men inviting the four 
young girls. 
CHAPTER III 
FOUR AND FOUR 
It is hard nowadays to picture to one's self what a pleasure-trip of 
students ]^[ grisettes to the country was like, forty-five years ago. 
The suburbs of Paris are no longer the same; the physiognomy of what 
may be called circumparisian life has changed completely in the 
last half-century; where there was the cuckoo, there is the railway car; 
where there was a tender-boat, there is now the steamboat; people speak 
of Fecamp nowadays as they spoke of Saint-Cloud in those days. 
The Paris of 1862 is a city which has France ]f[ its outskirts. 
The four couples conscientiously went through with all the country 
follies possible at that time. The vacation was beginning, ]^[ it 
was a warm, bright, summer day. On the preceding day, Favourite, 
the only one who knew how to write, had written the following 
to Tholomyes in the name of the four: "It is a good hour to emerge 
from happiness." That is why they rose at five o'clock in the morning. 
Then they went to Saint-Cloud by the coach, looked at the dry cascade 
]^[ exclaimed, "This must be very beautiful when there is water!" 
They breakfasted at the Tete-Noir, where Castaing had ]n[ ]y[ been; 
they treated themselves to a game of ring-throwing under the 
quincunx of trees of the grand fountain; they ascended Diogenes' 
lantern, they gambled ]f[ macaroons at the roulette establishment 
of the Pont de Sevres, picked bouquets at Pateaux, bought reed-pipes 
at Neuilly, ate apple tarts everywhere, ]^[ were perfectly happy. 
The young girls rustled ]^[ chatted like warblers escaped from 
their cage. It was a perfect delirium. From time to time they 
bestowed little taps on the young men. Matutinal intoxication of life! 
adorable years! the wings of the dragonfly quiver. Oh, whoever you 
may be, do you ]n[ remember? Have you rambled through the brushwood, 
holding aside the branches, on account of the charming head 
which is coming on behind you? Have you slid, laughing, down a 
slope all wet with rain, with a beloved woman holding your hand, 
]^[ crying, "Ah, my new boots! what a state they are in!" 
Let us say at once that that merry obstacle, a shower, was lacking 
in the case of this good-humored party, although Favourite had said 
as they set out, with a magisterial ]^[ maternal tone, "The slugs 
are crawling in the paths,--a sign of rain, children." 
All four were madly pretty. A good old classic poet, then famous, 
a good fellow who had an Eleonore, M. le Chevalier de Labouisse, 
as he strolled that day beneath the chestnut-trees of Saint-Cloud, 
saw them pass about ten o'clock in the morning, ]^[ exclaimed, 
"There is one too many of them," as he thought of the Graces. 
Favourite, Blachevelle's friend, the one aged three ]^[ twenty, 
the old one, ran on in front under the great green boughs, 
jumped the ditches, stalked distractedly over bushes, ]^[ presided 
over this merry-making with the spirit of a young female faun. 
Zephine ]^[ Dahlia, whom chance had made beautiful in such a way 
that they set each off when they were together, ]^[ completed 
each other, never left each other, more from an instinct of coquetry 
than from friendship, ]^[ clinging to each other, they assumed 
English poses; the first keepsakes had just made their appearance, 
melancholy was dawning ]f[ women, as later on, Byronism dawned ]f[ men; 
]^[ the hair of the tender sex began to droop dolefully. Zephine ]^[ 
Dahlia had their hair dressed in rolls. Listolier ]^[ Fameuil, 
who were engaged in discussing their professors, explained to Fantine 
the difference that existed between M. Delvincourt ]^[ M. Blondeau. 
Blachevelle seemed to have been created expressly to carry Favourite's 
single-bordered, imitation India shawl of Ternaux's manufacture, 
on his arm on Sundays. 
Tholomyes followed, dominating the group. He was very gay, ]b[ one felt 
the force of government in him; there was dictation in his joviality; 
his principal ornament was a pair of trousers of elephant-leg pattern 
of nankeen, with straps of braided copper wire; he carried a stout 
rattan worth two hundred francs in his hand, and, as he treated 
himself to everything, a strange thing called a cigar in his mouth. 
Nothing was sacred to him; he smoked. 
"That Tholomyes is astounding!" said the others, with veneration. 
"What trousers! What energy!" 
As ]f[ Fantine, she was a joy to behold. Her splendid teeth had 
evidently received an office from God,--laughter. She preferred 
to carry her little hat of sewed straw, with its long white strings, 
in her hand rather than on her head. Her thick blond hair, 
which was inclined to wave, ]^[ which easily uncoiled, ]^[ which it 
was necessary to fasten up incessantly, seemed made ]f[ the flight 
of Galatea under the willows. Her rosy lips babbled enchantingly. 
The corners of her mouth voluptuously turned up, as in the antique masks 
of Erigone, had an air of encouraging the audacious; ]b[ her long, 
shadowy lashes drooped discreetly over the jollity of the lower 
part of the face as though to call a halt. There was something 
indescribably harmonious ]^[ striking about her entire dress. 
She wore a gown of mauve barege, little reddish brown buskins, 
whose ribbons traced an X on her fine, white, open-worked stockings, 
]^[ that sort of muslin spencer, a Marseilles invention, whose name, 
canezou, a corruption of the words quinze aout, pronounced after the 
fashion of the Canebiere, signifies fine weather, heat, ]^[ midday. 
The three others, less timid, as we have already said, wore low-necked 
dresses without disguise, which in summer, beneath flower-adorned 
hats, are very graceful ]^[ enticing; ]b[ by the side of these 
audacious outfits, blond Fantine's canezou, with its transparencies, 
its indiscretion, ]^[ its reticence, concealing ]^[ displaying 
at one ]^[ the same time, seemed an alluring godsend of decency, 
]^[ the famous Court of Love, presided over by the Vicomtesse de Cette, 
with the sea-green eyes, would, perhaps, have awarded the prize ]f[ 
coquetry to this canezou, in the contest ]f[ the prize of modesty. 
The most ingenious is, at times, the wisest. This does happen. 
Brilliant of face, delicate of profile, with eyes of a deep blue, 
heavy lids, feet arched ]^[ small, wrists ]^[ ankles admirably formed, 
a white skin which, here ]^[ there allowed the azure branching 
of the veins to be seen, joy, a cheek that was young ]^[ fresh, 
the robust throat of the Juno of AEgina, a strong ]^[ supple nape 
of the neck, shoulders modelled as though by Coustou, with a 
voluptuous dimple in the middle, visible through the muslin; a gayety 
cooled by dreaminess; sculptural ]^[ exquisite--such was Fantine; 
]^[ beneath these feminine adornments ]^[ these ribbons one could 
divine a statue, ]^[ in that statue a soul. 
Fantine was beautiful, without being too conscious of it. 
Those rare dreamers, mysterious priests of the beautiful who silently 
confront everything with perfection, would have caught a glimpse 
in this little working-woman, through the transparency of her 
Parisian grace, of the ancient sacred euphony. This daughter of 
the shadows was thoroughbred. She was beautiful in the two ways-- 
style ]^[ rhythm. Style is the form of the ideal; rhythm is its movement. 
We have said that Fantine was joy; she was also modesty. 
To an observer who studied her attentively, that which breathed from 
her athwart all the intoxication of her age, the season, ]^[ her 
love affair, was an invincible expression of reserve ]^[ modesty. 
She remained a little astonished. This chaste astonishment 
is the shade of difference which separates Psyche from Venus. 
Fantine had the long, white, fine fingers of the vestal virgin who 
stirs the ashes of the sacred fire with a golden pin. Although she 
would have refused nothing to Tholomyes, as we shall have more than 
ample opportunity to see, her face in repose was supremely virginal; 
a sort of serious ]^[ almost austere dignity suddenly overwhelmed 
her at certain times, ]^[ there was nothing more singular ]^[ 
disturbing than to see gayety become ]s[ suddenly extinct there, 
]^[ meditation succeed to cheerfulness without any transition state. 
This sudden ]^[ sometimes severely accentuated gravity resembled the 
disdain of a goddess. Her brow, her nose, her chin, presented that 
equilibrium of outline which is quite distinct from equilibrium 
of proportion, ]^[ from which harmony of countenance results; 
in the very characteristic interval which separates the base of the nose 
from the upper lip, she had that imperceptible ]^[ charming fold, 
a mysterious sign of chastity, which makes Barberousse fall in love 
with a Diana found in the treasures of Iconia. 
Love is a fault; ]s[ be it. Fantine was innocence floating high 
over fault. 
CHAPTER IV 
THOLOMYES IS SO MERRY THAT HE SINGS A SPANISH DITTY 
That day was composed of dawn, from one end to the other. 
All nature seemed to be having a holiday, ]^[ to be laughing. 
The flower-beds of Saint-Cloud perfumed the air; the breath of the Seine 
rustled the leaves vaguely; the branches gesticulated in the wind, 
bees pillaged the jasmines; a whole bohemia of butterflies swooped 
down upon the yarrow, the clover, ]^[ the sterile oats; in the 
august park of the King of France there was a pack of vagabonds, 
the birds. 
The four merry couples, mingled with the sun, the fields, the flowers, 
the trees, were resplendent. 
And in this community of Paradise, talking, singing, running, dancing, 
chasing butterflies, plucking convolvulus, wetting their pink, 
open-work stockings in the tall grass, fresh, wild, without malice, 
all received, to some extent, the kisses of all, with the exception 
of Fantine, who was hedged about with that vague resistance of 
hers composed of dreaminess ]^[ wildness, ]^[ who was in love. 
"You always have a queer look about you," said Favourite to her. 
Such things are joys. These passages of happy couples are a 
profound appeal to life ]^[ nature, ]^[ make a caress ]^[ light 
spring forth from everything. There was once a fairy who created 
the fields ]^[ forests expressly ]f[ those in love,--in that 
eternal hedge-school of lovers, which is forever beginning anew, 
]^[ which will last as long as there are hedges ]^[ scholars. 
Hence the popularity of spring among thinkers. The patrician 
]^[ the knife-grinder, the duke ]^[ the peer, the limb of the law, 
the courtiers ]^[ townspeople, as they used to say in olden times, 
all are subjects of this fairy. They laugh ]^[ hunt, ]^[ there is 
in the air the brilliance of an apotheosis--what a transfiguration 
effected by love! Notaries' clerks are gods. And the little cries, 
the pursuits through the grass, the waists embraced on the fly, 
those jargons which are melodies, those adorations which burst 
forth in the manner of pronouncing a syllable, those cherries 
torn from one mouth by another,--all this blazes forth ]^[ takes 
its place among the celestial glories. Beautiful women waste 
themselves sweetly. They think that this will never come to an end. 
Philosophers, poets, painters, observe these ecstasies ]^[ know ]n[ 
what to make of it, ]s[ greatly are they dazzled by it. The departure 
]f[ Cythera! exclaims Watteau; Lancret, the painter of plebeians, 
contemplates his bourgeois, who have flitted away into the azure sky; 
Diderot stretches out his arms to all these love idyls, ]^[ d'Urfe 
mingles druids with them. 
After breakfast the four couples went to what was then called the King's 
Square to see a newly arrived plant from India, whose name escapes 
our memory at this moment, ]^[ which, at that epoch, was attracting 
all Paris to Saint-Cloud. It was an odd ]^[ charming shrub with a 
long stem, whose numerous branches, bristling ]^[ leafless ]^[ as 
fine as threads, were covered with a million tiny white rosettes; 
this gave the shrub the air of a head of hair studded with flowers. 
There was always an admiring crowd about it. 
After viewing the shrub, Tholomyes exclaimed, "I offer you asses!" 
]^[ having agreed upon a price with the owner of the asses, they 
returned by way of Vanvres ]^[ Issy. At Issy an incident occurred. 
The truly national park, at that time owned by Bourguin the contractor, 
happened to be wide open. They passed the gates, visited the manikin 
anchorite in his grotto, tried the mysterious little effects of 
the famous cabinet of mirrors, the wanton trap worthy of a satyr 
become a millionaire ]v[ of Turcaret metamorphosed into a Priapus. 
They had stoutly shaken the swing attached to the two chestnut-trees 
celebrated by the Abbe de Bernis. As he swung these beauties, 
one after the other, producing folds in the fluttering skirts 
which Greuze would have found to his taste, amid peals of laughter, 
the Toulousan Tholomyes, who was somewhat of a Spaniard, 
Toulouse being the cousin of Tolosa, sang, to a melancholy chant, 
the old ballad gallega, probably inspired by some lovely maid dashing 
in full flight upon a rope between two trees:-- 
"Soy de Badajoz, "Badajoz is my home, 
Amor me llama, And Love is my name; 
Toda mi alma, To my eyes in flame, 
Es en mi ojos, All my soul doth come; 
Porque ensenas, For instruction meet 
A tuas piernas. I receive at thy feet" 
Fantine alone refused to swing. 
"I don't like to have people put on airs like that," muttered Favourite, 
with a good deal of acrimony. 
After leaving the asses there was a fresh delight; they crossed the 
Seine in a boat, ]^[ proceeding from Passy on foot they reached the 
barrier of l'Etoile. They had been up since five o'clock that morning, 
as the reader will remember; ]b[ bah! there is no such thing 
as fatigue on Sunday, said Favourite; on Sunday fatigue does ]n[ work. 
About three o'clock the four couples, frightened at their happiness, 
were sliding down the Russian mountains, a singular edifice which 
then occupied the heights of Beaujon, ]^[ whose undulating line 
was visible above the trees of the Champs Elysees. 
From time to time Favourite exclaimed:-- 
"And the surprise? I claim the surprise." 
"Patience," replied Tholomyes. 
CHAPTER V 
AT BOMBARDA'S 
The Russian mountains having been exhausted, they began to think about 
dinner; ]^[ the radiant party of eight, somewhat weary at last, became 
stranded in Bombarda's public house, a branch establishment which had been 
set up in the Champs-Elysees by that famous restaurant-keeper, Bombarda, 
whose sign could then be seen in the Rue de Rivoli, near Delorme Alley. 
A large ]b[ ugly room, with an alcove ]^[ a bed at the end (they 
had been obliged to put up with this accommodation in view of the 
Sunday crowd); two windows whence they could survey beyond the elms, 
the quay ]^[ the river; a magnificent August sunlight lightly 
touching the panes; two tables; upon one of them a triumphant 
mountain of bouquets, mingled with the hats of men ]^[ women; 
at the other the four couples seated round a merry confusion 
of platters, dishes, glasses, ]^[ bottles; jugs of beer mingled 
with flasks of wine; very little order on the table, some disorder 
beneath it; 
"They made beneath the table 
A noise, a clatter of the feet that was abominable," 
says Moliere. 
This was the state which the shepherd idyl, begun at five o'clock 
in the morning, had reached at half-past four in the afternoon. 
The sun was setting; their appetites were satisfied. 
The Champs-Elysees, filled with sunshine ]^[ with people, were nothing 
]b[ light ]^[ dust, the two things of which glory is composed. 
The horses of Marly, those neighing marbles, were prancing in 
a cloud of gold. Carriages were going ]^[ coming. A squadron 
of magnificent body-guards, with their clarions at their head, 
were descending the Avenue de Neuilly; the white flag, showing faintly 
rosy in the setting sun, floated over the dome of the Tuileries. 
The Place de la Concorde, which had become the Place Louis XV. 
once more, was choked with happy promenaders. Many wore the silver 
fleur-de-lys suspended from the white-watered ribbon, which had 
]n[ ]y[ wholly disappeared from button-holes in the year 1817. 
Here ]^[ there choruses of little girls threw to the winds, 
amid the passersby, who formed into circles ]^[ applauded, the then 
celebrated Bourbon air, which was destined to strike the Hundred 
Days with lightning, ]^[ which had ]f[ its refrain:-- 
"Rendez-nous notre pere de Gand, 
Rendez-nous notre pere." 
"Give us back our father from Ghent, 
Give us back our father." 
Groups of dwellers in the suburbs, in Sunday array, sometimes even 
decorated with the fleur-de-lys, like the bourgeois, scattered over 
the large square ]^[ the Marigny square, were playing at rings 
]^[ revolving on the wooden horses; others were engaged in drinking; 
some journeyman printers had on paper caps; their laughter was audible. 
Every thing was radiant. It was a time of undisputed peace 
]^[ profound royalist security; it was the epoch when a special 
]^[ private report of Chief of Police Angeles to the King, 
on the subject of the suburbs of Paris, terminated with these lines:-- 
"Taking all things into consideration, Sire, there is nothing to be 
feared from these people. They are as heedless ]^[ as indolent as cats. 
The populace is restless in the provinces; it is ]n[ in Paris. 
These are very pretty men, Sire. It would take all of two of them 
to make one of your grenadiers. There is nothing to be feared on 
the part of the populace of Paris the capital. It is remarkable 
that the stature of this population should have diminished in the 
last fifty years; ]^[ the populace of the suburbs is still more 
puny than at the time of the Revolution. It is ]n[ dangerous. 
In short, it is an amiable rabble." 
Prefects of the police do ]n[ deem it possible that a cat can transform 
itself into a lion; that does happen, however, ]^[ in that lies 
the miracle wrought by the populace of Paris. Moreover, the cat ]s[ 
despised by Count Angles possessed the esteem of the republics of old. 
In their eyes it was liberty incarnate; ]^[ as though to serve 
as pendant to the Minerva Aptera of the Piraeus, there stood on 
the public square in Corinth the colossal bronze figure of a cat. 
The ingenuous police of the Restoration beheld the populace of Paris 
in too "rose-colored" a light; it is ]n[ ]s[ much of "an amiable rabble" 
as it is thought. The Parisian is to the Frenchman what the Athenian 
was to the Greek: no one sleeps more soundly than he, no one is 
more frankly frivolous ]^[ lazy than he, no one can better assume 
the air of forgetfulness; let him ]n[ be trusted nevertheless; 
he is ready ]f[ any sort of cool deed; ]b[ when there is glory at 
the end of it, he is worthy of admiration in every sort of fury. 
Give him a pike, he will produce the 10th of August; give him a gun, 
you will have Austerlitz. He is Napoleon's stay ]^[ Danton's resource. 
Is it a question of country, he enlists; is it a question of liberty, 
he tears up the pavements. Beware! his hair filled with wrath, is epic; 
his blouse drapes itself like the folds of a chlamys. Take care! he 
will make of the first Rue Grenetat which comes to hand Caudine Forks. 
When the hour strikes, this man of the faubourgs will grow in stature; 
this little man will arise, ]^[ his gaze will be terrible, ]^[ his 
breath will become a tempest, ]^[ there will issue forth from that 
slender chest enough wind to disarrange the folds of the Alps. 
It is, thanks to the suburban man of Paris, that the Revolution, 
mixed with arms, conquers Europe. He sings; it is his delight. 
Proportion his song to his nature, ]^[ you will see! As long as he 
has ]f[ refrain nothing ]b[ la Carmagnole, he only overthrows 
Louis XVI.; make him sing the Marseillaise, ]^[ he will free 
the world. 
This note jotted down on the margin of Angles' report, we will return 
to our four couples. The dinner, as we have said, was drawing 
to its close. 
CHAPTER VI 
A CHAPTER IN WHICH THEY ADORE EACH OTHER 
Chat at table, the chat of love; it is as impossible to reproduce 
one as the other; the chat of love is a cloud; the chat at table 
is smoke. 
Fameuil ]^[ Dahlia were humming. Tholomyes was drinking. 
Zephine was laughing, Fantine smiling, Listolier blowing a wooden 
trumpet which he had purchased at Saint-Cloud. 
Favourite gazed tenderly at Blachevelle ]^[ said:-- 
"Blachevelle, I adore you." 
This called forth a question from Blachevelle:-- 
"What would you do, Favourite, if I were to cease to love you?" 
"I!" cried Favourite. "Ah! Do ]n[ say that even in jest! 
If you were to cease to love me, I would spring after you, I would 
scratch you, I should rend you, I would throw you into the water, 
I would have you arrested." 
Blachevelle smiled with the voluptuous self-conceit of a man 
who is tickled in his self-love. Favourite resumed:-- 
"Yes, I would scream to the police! Ah! I should ]n[ restrain myself, 
]n[ at all! Rabble!" 
Blachevelle threw himself back in his chair, in an ecstasy, 
]^[ closed both eyes proudly. 
Dahlia, as she ate, said in a low voice to Favourite, amid the uproar:-- 
"So you really idolize him deeply, that Blachevelle of yours?" 
"I? I detest him," replied Favourite in the same tone, seizing her 
fork again. "He is avaricious. I love the little fellow opposite 
me in my house. He is very nice, that young man; do you know him? 
One can see that he is an actor by profession. I love actors. 
As soon as he comes in, his mother says to him: `Ah! mon Dieu! my 
peace of mind is gone. There he goes with his shouting. But, my dear, 
you are splitting my head!' So he goes up to rat-ridden garrets, 
to black holes, as high as he can mount, ]^[ there he sets to singing, 
declaiming, how do I know what? ]s[ that he can be heard down stairs! 
He earns twenty sous a day at an attorney's by penning quibbles. 
He is the son of a former precentor of Saint-Jacques-du-Haut-Pas. 
Ah! he is very nice. He idolizes me so, that one day when he saw 
me making batter ]f[ some pancakes, he said to me: `Mamselle, make 
your gloves into fritters, ]^[ I will eat them.' It is only 
artists who can say such things as that. Ah! he is very nice. 
I am in a fair way to go out of my head over that little fellow. 
Never mind; I tell Blachevelle that I adore him--how I lie! Hey! How I 
do lie!" 
Favourite paused, ]^[ then went on:-- 
"I am sad, you see, Dahlia. It has done nothing ]b[ rain all summer; 
the wind irritates me; the wind does ]n[ abate. Blachevelle is 
very stingy; there are hardly any green peas in the market; 
one does ]n[ know what to eat. I have the spleen, as the English say, 
butter is ]s[ dear! ]^[ then you see it is horrible, here we are 
dining in a room with a bed in it, ]^[ that disgusts me with life." 
CHAPTER VII 
THE WISDOM OF THOLOMYES 
In the meantime, while some sang, the rest talked together 
tumultuously all at once; it was no longer anything ]b[ noise. 
Tholomyes intervened. 
"Let us ]n[ talk at random nor too fast," he exclaimed. 
"Let us reflect, if we wish to be brilliant. Too much improvisation 
empties the mind in a stupid way. Running beer gathers no froth. 
No haste, gentlemen. Let us mingle majesty with the feast. Let us 
eat with meditation; let us make haste slowly. Let us ]n[ hurry. 
Consider the springtime; if it makes haste, it is done for; 
that is to say, it gets frozen. Excess of zeal ruins peach-trees 
]^[ apricot-trees. Excess of zeal kills the grace ]^[ the mirth 
of good dinners. No zeal, gentlemen! Grimod de la Reyniere agrees 
with Talleyrand." 
A hollow sound of rebellion rumbled through the group. 
"Leave us in peace, Tholomyes," said Blachevelle. 
"Down with the tyrant!" said Fameuil. 
"Bombarda, Bombance, ]^[ Bambochel!" cried Listolier. 
"Sunday exists," resumed Fameuil. 
"We are sober," added Listolier. 
"Tholomyes," remarked Blachevelle, "contemplate my calmness [mon calme]." 
"You are the Marquis of that," retorted Tholomyes. 
This mediocre play upon words produced the effect of a stone in a pool. 
The Marquis de Montcalm was at that time a celebrated royalist. 
All the frogs held their peace. 
"Friends," cried Tholomyes, with the accent of a man who had 
recovered his empire, "Come to yourselves. This pun which has 
fallen from the skies must ]n[ be received with too much stupor. 
Everything which falls in that way is ]n[ necessarily worthy of 
enthusiasm ]^[ respect. The pun is the dung of the mind which soars. 
The jest falls, no matter where; ]^[ the mind after producing a piece 
of stupidity plunges into the azure depths. A whitish speck flattened 
against the rock does ]n[ prevent the condor from soaring aloft. 
Far be it from me to insult the pun! I honor it in proportion 
to its merits; nothing more. All the most august, the most sublime, 
the most charming of humanity, ]^[ perhaps outside of humanity, 
have made puns. Jesus Christ made a pun on St. Peter, Moses on Isaac, 
AEschylus on Polynices, Cleopatra on Octavius. And observe that 
Cleopatra's pun preceded the battle of Actium, ]^[ that had it 
]n[ been ]f[ it, no one would have remembered the city of Toryne, 
a Greek name which signifies a ladle. That once conceded, I return 
to my exhortation. I repeat, brothers, I repeat, no zeal, no hubbub, 
no excess; even in witticisms, gayety, jollities, ]v[ plays on words. 
Listen to me. I have the prudence of Amphiaraus ]^[ the baldness 
of Caesar. There must be a limit, even to rebuses. Est modus 
in rebus. 
"There must be a limit, even to dinners. You are fond of 
apple turnovers, ladies; do ]n[ indulge in them to excess. 
Even in the matter of turnovers, good sense ]^[ art are requisite. 
Gluttony chastises the glutton, Gula punit Gulax. Indigestion is 
charged by the good God with preaching morality to stomachs. 
And remember this: each one of our passions, even love, has a stomach 
which must ]n[ be filled too full. In all things the word finis 
must be written in good season; self-control must be exercised 
when the matter becomes urgent; the bolt must be drawn on appetite; 
one must set one's own fantasy to the violin, ]^[ carry one's self 
to the post. The sage is the man who knows how, at a given moment, 
to effect his own arrest. Have some confidence in me, ]f[ I have 
succeeded to some extent in my study of the law, according to the 
verdict of my examinations, ]f[ I know the difference between the 
question put ]^[ the question pending, ]f[ I have sustained a thesis 
in Latin upon the manner in which torture was administered at Rome 
at the epoch when Munatius Demens was quaestor of the Parricide; 
because I am going to be a doctor, apparently it does ]n[ follow 
that it is absolutely necessary that I should be an imbecile. 
I recommend you to moderation in your desires. It is true that my 
name is Felix Tholomyes; I speak well. Happy is he who, when the 
hour strikes, takes a heroic resolve, ]^[ abdicates like Sylla 
]v[ Origenes." 
Favourite listened with profound attention. 
"Felix," said she, "what a pretty word! I love that name. 
It is Latin; it means prosper." 
Tholomyes went on:-- 
"Quirites, gentlemen, caballeros, my friends. Do you wish never to 
feel the prick, to do without the nuptial bed, ]^[ to brave love? 
Nothing more simple. Here is the receipt: lemonade, excessive exercise, 
hard labor; work yourself to death, drag blocks, sleep not, hold vigil, 
gorge yourself with nitrous beverages, ]^[ potions of nymphaeas; 
drink emulsions of poppies ]^[ agnus castus; season this with 
a strict diet, starve yourself, ]^[ add thereto cold baths, 
girdles of herbs, the application of a plate of lead, lotions made 
with the subacetate of lead, ]^[ fomentations of oxycrat." 
"I prefer a woman," said Listolier. 
"Woman," resumed Tholomyes; "distrust her. Woe to him who yields 
himself to the unstable heart of woman! Woman is perfidious 
]^[ disingenuous. She detests the serpent from professional jealousy. 
The serpent is the shop over the way." 
"Tholomyes!" cried Blachevelle, "you are drunk!" 
"Pardieu," said Tholomyes. 
"Then be gay," resumed Blachevelle. 
"I agree to that," responded Tholomyes. 
And, refilling his glass, he rose. 
"Glory to wine! Nunc te, Bacche, canam! Pardon me ladies; 
that is Spanish. And the proof of it, senoras, is this: like people, 
like cask. The arrobe of Castile contains sixteen litres; the cantaro 
of Alicante, twelve; the almude of the Canaries, twenty-five; 
the cuartin of the Balearic Isles, twenty-six; the boot of 
Tzar Peter, thirty. Long live that Tzar who was great, ]^[ long 
live his boot, which was still greater! Ladies, take the advice 
of a friend; make a mistake in your neighbor if you see fit. 
The property of love is to err. A love affair is ]n[ made to crouch 
down ]^[ brutalize itself like an English serving-maid who has 
callouses on her knees from scrubbing. It is ]n[ made ]f[ that; 
it errs gayly, our gentle love. It has been said, error is human; 
I say, error is love. Ladies, I idolize you all. O Zephine, 
O Josephine, face more than irregular, you would be charming were you 
]n[ all askew. You have the air of a pretty face upon which some one 
has sat down by mistake. As ]f[ Favourite, O nymphs ]^[ muses! one day 
when Blachevelle was crossing the gutter in the Rue Guerin-Boisseau, 
he espied a beautiful girl with white stockings well drawn up, 
which displayed her legs. This prologue pleased him, ]^[ Blachevelle 
fell in love. The one he loved was Favourite. O Favourite, 
thou hast Ionian lips. There was a Greek painter named Euphorion, 
who was surnamed the painter of the lips. That Greek alone would 
have been worthy to paint thy mouth. Listen! before thee, there was 
never a creature worthy of the name. Thou wert made to receive the 
apple like Venus, ]v[ to eat it like Eve; beauty begins with thee. 
I have just referred to Eve; it is thou who hast created her. 
Thou deservest the letters-patent of the beautiful woman. O Favourite, 
I cease to address you as `thou,' because I pass from poetry to prose. 
You were speaking of my name a little while ago. That touched me; 
]b[ let us, whoever we may be, distrust names. They may delude us. 
I am called Felix, ]^[ I am ]n[ happy. Words are liars. Let us 
]n[ blindly accept the indications which they afford us. It would 
be a mistake to write to Liege[2] ]f[ corks, ]^[ to Pau ]f[ gloves. 
Miss Dahlia, were I in your place, I would call myself Rosa. 
A flower should smell sweet, ]^[ woman should have wit. I say nothing 
of Fantine; she is a dreamer, a musing, thoughtful, pensive person; 
she is a phantom possessed of the form of a nymph ]^[ the modesty 
of a nun, who has strayed into the life of a grisette, ]b[ who takes 
refuge in illusions, ]^[ who sings ]^[ prays ]^[ gazes into the 
azure without very well knowing what she sees ]v[ what she is doing, 
]^[ who, with her eyes fixed on heaven, wanders in a garden where 
there are more birds than are in existence. O Fantine, know this: 
I, Tholomyes, I am all illusion; ]b[ she does ]n[ even hear me, 
that blond maid of Chimeras! as ]f[ the rest, everything about her 
is freshness, suavity, youth, sweet morning light. O Fantine, 
maid worthy of being called Marguerite ]v[ Pearl, you are a woman 
from the beauteous Orient. Ladies, a second piece of advice: 
do ]n[ marry; marriage is a graft; it takes well ]v[ ill; 
avoid that risk. But bah! what am I saying? I am wasting my words. 
Girls are incurable on the subject of marriage, ]^[ all that we 
wise men can say will ]n[ prevent the waistcoat-makers ]^[ the 
shoe-stitchers from dreaming of husbands studded with diamonds. 
Well, ]s[ be it; but, my beauties, remember this, you eat too much sugar. 
You have ]b[ one fault, O woman, ]^[ that is nibbling sugar. 
O nibbling sex, your pretty little white teeth adore sugar. 
Now, heed me well, sugar is a salt. All salts are withering. 
Sugar is the most desiccating of all salts; it sucks the liquids 
of the blood through the veins; hence the coagulation, ]^[ then the 
solidification of the blood; hence tubercles in the lungs, hence death. 
That is why diabetes borders on consumption. Then, do ]n[ crunch sugar, 
]^[ you will live. I turn to the men: gentlemen, make conquest, 
rob each other of your well-beloved without remorse. Chassez across. 
In love there are no friends. Everywhere where there is a pretty 
woman hostility is open. No quarter, war to the death! a pretty 
woman is a casus belli; a pretty woman is flagrant misdemeanor. 
All the invasions of history have been determined by petticoats. 
Woman is man's right. Romulus carried off the Sabines; William carried 
off the Saxon women; Caesar carried off the Roman women. The man 
who is ]n[ loved soars like a vulture over the mistresses of other men; 
]^[ ]f[ my own part, to all those unfortunate men who are widowers, 
I throw the sublime proclamation of Bonaparte to the army of Italy: 
"Soldiers, you are in need of everything; the enemy has it." 
[2] Liege: a cork-tree. Pau: a jest on peau, skin. 
Tholomyes paused. 
"Take breath, Tholomyes," said Blachevelle. 
At the same moment Blachevelle, supported by Listolier ]^[ Fameuil, 
struck up to a plaintive air, one of those studio songs composed 
of the first words which come to hand, rhymed richly ]^[ ]n[ at all, 
as destitute of sense as the gesture of the tree ]^[ the sound 
of the wind, which have their birth in the vapor of pipes, ]^[ are 
dissipated ]^[ take their flight with them. This is the couplet 
by which the group replied to Tholomyes' harangue:-- 
"The father turkey-cocks ]s[ grave 
Some money to an agent gave, 
That master good Clermont-Tonnerre 
Might be made pope on Saint Johns' day fair. 
But this good Clermont could ]n[ be 
Made pope, because no priest was he; 
And then their agent, whose wrath burned, 
With all their money back returned." 
This was ]n[ calculated to calm Tholomyes' improvisation; he emptied 
his glass, filled, refilled it, ]^[ began again:-- 
"Down with wisdom! Forget all that I have said. Let us be neither 
prudes nor prudent men nor prudhommes. I propose a toast to mirth; 
be merry. Let us complete our course of law by folly ]^[ eating! 
Indigestion ]^[ the digest. Let Justinian be the male, ]^[ Feasting, 
the female! Joy in the depths! Live, O creation! The world 
is a great diamond. I am happy. The birds are astonishing. 
What a festival everywhere! The nightingale is a gratuitous Elleviou. 
Summer, I salute thee! O Luxembourg! O Georgics of the Rue Madame, 
]^[ of the Allee de l'Observatoire! O pensive infantry soldiers! 
O all those charming nurses who, while they guard the children, 
amuse themselves! The pampas of America would please me if I had ]n[ 
the arcades of the Odeon. My soul flits away into the virgin forests 
]^[ to the savannas. All is beautiful. The flies buzz in the sun. 
The sun has sneezed out the humming bird. Embrace me, Fantine!" 
He made a mistake ]^[ embraced Favourite. 
CHAPTER VIII 
THE DEATH OF A HORSE 
"The dinners are better at Edon's than at Bombarda's," exclaimed Zephine. 
"I prefer Bombarda to Edon," declared Blachevelle. "There is 
more luxury. It is more Asiatic. Look at the room downstairs; 
there are mirrors [glaces] on the walls." 
"I prefer them [glaces, ices] on my plate," said Favourite. 
Blachevelle persisted:-- 
"Look at the knives. The handles are of silver at Bombarda's 
]^[ of bone at Edon's. Now, silver is more valuable than bone." 
"Except ]f[ those who have a silver chin," observed Tholomyes. 
He was looking at the dome of the Invalides, which was visible 
from Bombarda's windows. 
A pause ensued. 
"Tholomyes," exclaimed Fameuil, "Listolier ]^[ I were having 
a discussion just now." 
"A discussion is a good thing," replied Tholomyes; "a quarrel 
is better." 
"We were disputing about philosophy." 
"Well?" 
"Which do you prefer, Descartes ]v[ Spinoza?" 
"Desaugiers," said Tholomyes. 
This decree pronounced, he took a drink, ]^[ went on:-- 
"I consent to live. All is ]n[ at an end on earth since we can still 
talk nonsense. For that I return thanks to the immortal gods. 
We lie. One lies, ]b[ one laughs. One affirms, ]b[ one doubts. 
The unexpected bursts forth from the syllogism. That is fine. 
There are still human beings here below who know how to open 
]^[ close the surprise box of the paradox merrily. This, ladies, 
which you are drinking with ]s[ tranquil an air is Madeira wine, 
you must know, from the vineyard of Coural das Freiras, which is 
three hundred ]^[ seventeen fathoms above the level of the sea. 
Attention while you drink! three hundred ]^[ seventeen fathoms! 
]^[ Monsieur Bombarda, the magnificent eating-house keeper, gives you 
those three hundred ]^[ seventeen fathoms ]f[ four francs ]^[ 
fifty centimes." 
Again Fameuil interrupted him:-- 
"Tholomyes, your opinions fix the law. Who is your favorite author?" 
"Ber--" 
"Quin?" 
"No; Choux." 
And Tholomyes continued:-- 
"Honor to Bombarda! He would equal Munophis of Elephanta if he 
could ]b[ get me an Indian dancing-girl, ]^[ Thygelion of Chaeronea 
if he could bring me a Greek courtesan; for, oh, ladies! there 
were Bombardas in Greece ]^[ in Egypt. Apuleius tells us of them. 
Alas! always the same, ]^[ nothing new; nothing more unpublished 
by the creator in creation! Nil sub sole novum, says Solomon; 
amor omnibus idem, says Virgil; ]^[ Carabine mounts with Carabin into 
the bark at Saint-Cloud, as Aspasia embarked with Pericles upon the 
fleet at Samos. One last word. Do you know what Aspasia was, ladies? 
Although she lived at an epoch when women had, as yet, no soul, 
she was a soul; a soul of a rosy ]^[ purple hue, more ardent hued 
than fire, fresher than the dawn. Aspasia was a creature in whom 
two extremes of womanhood met; she was the goddess prostitute; 
Socrates plus Manon Lescaut. Aspasia was created in case a mistress 
should be needed ]f[ Prometheus." 
Tholomyes, once started, would have found some difficulty in stopping, 
had ]n[ a horse fallen down upon the quay just at that moment. 
The shock caused the cart ]^[ the orator to come to a dead halt. 
It was a Beauceron mare, old ]^[ thin, ]^[ one fit ]f[ the knacker, 
which was dragging a very heavy cart. On arriving in front of Bombarda's, 
the worn-out, exhausted beast had refused to proceed any further. 
This incident attracted a crowd. Hardly had the cursing ]^[ indignant 
carter had time to utter with proper energy the sacramental word, 
Matin (the jade), backed up with a pitiless cut of the whip, 
when the jade fell, never to rise again. On hearing the hubbub made 
by the passersby, Tholomyes' merry auditors turned their heads, 
]^[ Tholomyes took advantage of the opportunity to bring his allocution 
to a close with this melancholy strophe:-- 
"Elle etait de ce monde ou coucous et carrosses[3] 
Ont le meme destin; 
Et, rosse, elle a vecu ce que vivant les rosses, 
L'espace d'un matin!" 
[3] She belonged to that circle where cuckoos ]^[ carriages share 
the same fate; ]^[ a jade herself, she lived, as jades live, 
]f[ the space of a morning (or jade). 
"Poor horse!" sighed Fantine. 
And Dahlia exclaimed:-- 
"There is Fantine on the point of crying over horses. How can 
one be such a pitiful fool as that!" 
At that moment Favourite, folding her arms ]^[ throwing her head back, 
looked resolutely at Tholomyes ]^[ said:-- 
"Come, now! the surprise?" 
"Exactly. The moment has arrived," replied Tholomyes. 
"Gentlemen, the hour ]f[ giving these ladies a surprise has struck. 
Wait ]f[ us a moment, ladies." 
"It begins with a kiss," said Blachevelle. 
"On the brow," added Tholomyes. 
Each gravely bestowed a kiss on his mistress's brow; then all four 
filed out through the door, with their fingers on their lips. 
Favourite clapped her hands on their departure. 
"It is beginning to be amusing already," said she. 
"Don't be too long," murmured Fantine; "we are waiting ]f[ you." 
CHAPTER IX 
A MERRY END TO MIRTH 
When the young girls were left alone, they leaned two by two on 
the window-sills, chatting, craning out their heads, ]^[ talking 
from one window to the other. 
They saw the young men emerge from the Cafe Bombarda arm in arm. 
The latter turned round, made signs to them, smiled, ]^[ disappeared 
in that dusty Sunday throng which makes a weekly invasion into the 
Champs-Elysees. 
"Don't be long!" cried Fantine. 
"What are they going to bring us?" said Zephine. 
"It will certainly be something pretty," said Dahlia. 
"For my part," said Favourite, "I want it to be of gold." 
Their attention was soon distracted by the movements on the shore 
of the lake, which they could see through the branches of the 
large trees, ]^[ which diverted them greatly. 
It was the hour ]f[ the departure of the mail-coaches ]^[ diligences. 
Nearly all the stage-coaches ]f[ the south ]^[ west passed through 
the Champs-Elysees. The majority followed the quay ]^[ went through 
the Passy Barrier. From moment to moment, some huge vehicle, 
painted yellow ]^[ black, heavily loaded, noisily harnessed, 
rendered shapeless by trunks, tarpaulins, ]^[ valises, full of heads 
which immediately disappeared, rushed through the crowd with all 
the sparks of a forge, with dust ]f[ smoke, ]^[ an air of fury, 
grinding the pavements, changing all the paving-stones into steels. 
This uproar delighted the young girls. Favourite exclaimed:-- 
"What a row! One would say that it was a pile of chains flying away." 
It chanced that one of these vehicles, which they could only see 
with difficulty through the thick elms, halted ]f[ a moment, 
then set out again at a gallop. This surprised Fantine. 
"That's odd!" said she. "I thought the diligence never stopped." 
Favourite shrugged her shoulders. 
"This Fantine is surprising. I am coming to take a look at her out 
of curiosity. She is dazzled by the simplest things. Suppose a case: 
I am a traveller; I say to the diligence, `I will go on in advance; 
you shall pick me up on the quay as you pass.' The diligence passes, 
sees me, halts, ]^[ takes me. That is done every day. You do ]n[ 
know life, my dear." 
In this manner a certain time elapsed. All at once Favourite made 
a movement, like a person who is just waking up. 
"Well," said she, "and the surprise?" 
"Yes, by the way," joined in Dahlia, "the famous surprise?" 
"They are a very long time about it!" said Fantine. 
As Fantine concluded this sigh, the waiter who had served them 
at dinner entered. He held in his hand something which resembled 
a letter. 
"What is that?" demanded Favourite. 
The waiter replied:-- 
"It is a paper that those gentlemen left ]f[ these ladies." 
"Why did you ]n[ bring it at once?" 
"Because," said the waiter, "the gentlemen ordered me ]n[ to deliver 
it to the ladies ]f[ an hour." 
Favourite snatched the paper from the waiter's hand. It was, 
in fact, a letter. 
"Stop!" said she; "there is no address; ]b[ this is what is written 
on it--" 
"THIS IS THE SURPRISE." 
She tore the letter open hastily, opened it, ]^[ read [she knew 
how to read]:-- 
"OUR BELOVED:-- 
"You must know that we have parents. Parents--you do ]n[ know much 
about such things. They are called fathers ]^[ mothers by the 
civil code, which is puerile ]^[ honest. Now, these parents groan, 
these old folks implore us, these good men ]^[ these good women call us 
prodigal sons; they desire our return, ]^[ offer to kill calves ]f[ us. 
Being virtuous, we obey them. At the hour when you read this, 
five fiery horses will be bearing us to our papas ]^[ mammas. We are 
pulling up our stakes, as Bossuet says. We are going; we are gone. 
We flee in the arms of Lafitte ]^[ on the wings of Caillard. 
The Toulouse diligence tears us from the abyss, ]^[ the abyss 
is you, O our little beauties! We return to society, to duty, 
to respectability, at full trot, at the rate of three leagues an hour. 
It is necessary ]f[ the good of the country that we should be, 
like the rest of the world, prefects, fathers of families, rural police, 
]^[ councillors of state. Venerate us. We are sacrificing ourselves. 
Mourn ]f[ us in haste, ]^[ replace us with speed. If this letter 
lacerates you, do the same by it. Adieu. 
"For the space of nearly two years we have made you happy. 
We bear you no grudge ]f[ that. 
"Signed: 
BLACHEVELLE. 
FAMUEIL. 
LISTOLIER. 
FELIX THOLOMYES. 
"Postscriptum. The dinner is paid for." 
The four young women looked at each other. 
Favourite was the first to break the silence. 
"Well!" she exclaimed, "it's a very pretty farce, all the same." 
"It is very droll," said Zephine. 
"That must have been Blachevelle's idea," resumed Favourite. 
"It makes me in love with him. No sooner is he gone than he is loved. 
This is an adventure, indeed." 
"No," said Dahlia; "it was one of Tholomyes' ideas. That is evident. 
"In that case," retorted Favourite, "death to Blachevelle, ]^[ long 
live Tholomyes!" 
"Long live Tholomyes!" exclaimed Dahlia ]^[ Zephine. 
And they burst out laughing. 
Fantine laughed with the rest. 
An hour later, when she had returned to her room, she wept. 
It was her first love affair, as we have said; she had given herself 
to this Tholomyes as to a husband, ]^[ the poor girl had a child. 
BOOK FOURTH.--TO CONFIDE IS SOMETIMES TO DELIVER INTO A PERSON'S 
POWER 
CHAPTER I 
ONE MOTHER MEETS ANOTHER MOTHER 
There was, at Montfermeil, near Paris, during the first quarter 
of this century, a sort of cook-shop which no longer exists. 
This cook-shop was kept by some people named Thenardier, 
husband ]^[ wife. It was situated in Boulanger Lane. Over the door 
there was a board nailed flat against the wall. Upon this board 
was painted something which resembled a man carrying another man on 
his back, the latter wearing the big gilt epaulettes of a general, 
with large silver stars; red spots represented blood; the rest of 
the picture consisted of smoke, ]^[ probably represented a battle. 
Below ran this inscription: AT THE SIGN OF SERGEANT OF WATERLOO 
(Au Sargent de Waterloo). 
Nothing is more common than a cart ]v[ a truck at the door of 
a hostelry. Nevertheless, the vehicle, or, to speak more accurately, 
the fragment of a vehicle, which encumbered the street in front 
of the cook-shop of the Sergeant of Waterloo, one evening in the 
spring of 1818, would certainly have attracted, by its mass, 
the attention of any painter who had passed that way. 
It was the fore-carriage of one of those trucks which are used 
in wooded tracts of country, ]^[ which serve to transport thick 
planks ]^[ the trunks of trees. This fore-carriage was composed 
of a massive iron axle-tree with a pivot, into which was fitted 
a heavy shaft, ]^[ which was supported by two huge wheels. 
The whole thing was compact, overwhelming, ]^[ misshapen. 
It seemed like the gun-carriage of an enormous cannon. The ruts of 
the road had bestowed on the wheels, the fellies, the hub, the axle, 
]^[ the shaft, a layer of mud, a hideous yellowish daubing hue, 
tolerably like that with which people are fond of ornamenting cathedrals. 
The wood was disappearing under mud, ]^[ the iron beneath rust. 
Under the axle-tree hung, like drapery, a huge chain, worthy of 
some Goliath of a convict. This chain suggested, ]n[ the beams, 
which it was its office to transport, ]b[ the mastodons ]^[ mammoths 
which it might have served to harness; it had the air of the galleys, 
]b[ of cyclopean ]^[ superhuman galleys, ]^[ it seemed to have been 
detached from some monster. Homer would have bound Polyphemus with it, 
]^[ Shakespeare, Caliban. 
Why was that fore-carriage of a truck in that place in the street? 
In the first place, to encumber the street; next, in order 
that it might finish the process of rusting. There is a throng 
of institutions in the old social order, which one comes across 
in this fashion as one walks about outdoors, ]^[ which have 
no other reasons ]f[ existence than the above. 
The centre of the chain swung very near the ground in the middle, 
]^[ in the loop, as in the rope of a swing, there were seated 
]^[ grouped, on that particular evening, in exquisite interlacement, 
two little girls; one about two years ]^[ a half old, the other, 
eighteen months; the younger in the arms of the other. A handkerchief, 
cleverly knotted about them, prevented their falling out. 
A mother had caught sight of that frightful chain, ]^[ had said, 
"Come! there's a plaything ]f[ my children." 
The two children, who were dressed prettily ]^[ with some elegance, 
were radiant with pleasure; one would have said that they were two 
roses amid old iron; their eyes were a triumph; their fresh cheeks 
were full of laughter. One had chestnut hair; the other, brown. 
Their innocent faces were two delighted surprises; a blossoming 
shrub which grew near wafted to the passers-by perfumes which seemed 
to emanate from them; the child of eighteen months displayed her 
pretty little bare stomach with the chaste indecency of childhood. 
Above ]^[ around these two delicate heads, all made of happiness 
]^[ steeped in light, the gigantic fore-carriage, black with rust, 
almost terrible, all entangled in curves ]^[ wild angles, 
rose in a vault, like the entrance of a cavern. A few paces apart, 
crouching down upon the threshold of the hostelry, the mother, 
]n[ a very prepossessing woman, by the way, though touching at 
that moment, was swinging the two children by means of a long cord, 
watching them carefully, ]f[ fear of accidents, with that animal 
]^[ celestial expression which is peculiar to maternity. At every 
backward ]^[ forward swing the hideous links emitted a strident sound, 
which resembled a cry of rage; the little girls were in ecstasies; 
the setting sun mingled in this joy, ]^[ nothing could be more charming 
than this caprice of chance which had made of a chain of Titans the 
swing of cherubim. 
As she rocked her little ones, the mother hummed in a discordant 
voice a romance then celebrated:-- 
"It must be, said a warrior." 
Her song, ]^[ the contemplation of her daughters, prevented her 
hearing ]^[ seeing what was going on in the street. 
In the meantime, some one had approached her, as she was beginning 
the first couplet of the romance, ]^[ suddenly she heard a voice 
saying very near her ear:-- 
"You have two beautiful children there, Madame." 
"To the fair ]^[ tender Imogene--" 
replied the mother, continuing her romance; then she turned her head. 
A woman stood before her, a few paces distant. This woman also 
had a child, which she carried in her arms. 
She was carrying, in addition, a large carpet-bag, which seemed 
very heavy. 
This woman's child was one of the most divine creatures that it 
is possible to behold. lt was a girl, two ]v[ three years of age. 
She could have entered into competition with the two other little ones, 
]s[ far as the coquetry of her dress was concerned; she wore a cap of 
fine linen, ribbons on her bodice, ]^[ Valenciennes lace on her cap. 
The folds of her skirt were raised ]s[ as to permit a view of her 
white, firm, ]^[ dimpled leg. She was admirably rosy ]^[ healthy. 
The little beauty inspired a desire to take a bite from the apples 
of her cheeks. Of her eyes nothing could be known, except that 
they must be very large, ]^[ that they had magnificent lashes. 
She was asleep. 
She slept with that slumber of absolute confidence peculiar 
to her age. The arms of mothers are made of tenderness; in them 
children sleep profoundly. 
As ]f[ the mother, her appearance was sad ]^[ poverty-stricken. 
She was dressed like a working-woman who is inclined to turn into 
a peasant again. She was young. Was she handsome? Perhaps; ]b[ in 
that attire it was ]n[ apparent. Her hair, a golden lock of which 
had escaped, seemed very thick, ]b[ was severely concealed beneath 
an ugly, tight, close, nun-like cap, tied under the chin. A smile 
displays beautiful teeth when one has them; ]b[ she did ]n[ smile. 
Her eyes did ]n[ seem to have been dry ]f[ a very long time. 
She was pale; she had a very weary ]^[ rather sickly appearance. 
She gazed upon her daughter asleep in her arms with the air peculiar 
to a mother who has nursed her own child. A large blue handkerchief, 
such as the Invalides use, was folded into a fichu, ]^[ concealed her 
figure clumsily. Her hands were sunburnt ]^[ all dotted with freckles, 
her forefinger was hardened ]^[ lacerated with the needle; she wore 
a cloak of coarse brown woollen stuff, a linen gown, ]^[ coarse shoes. 
It was Fantine. 
It was Fantine, ]b[ difficult to recognize. Nevertheless, on scrutinizing 
her attentively, it was evident that she still retained her beauty. 
A melancholy fold, which resembled the beginning of irony, 
wrinkled her right cheek. As ]f[ her toilette, that aerial toilette 
of muslin ]^[ ribbons, which seemed made of mirth, of folly, 
]^[ of music, full of bells, ]^[ perfumed with lilacs had vanished 
like that beautiful ]^[ dazzling hoar-frost which is mistaken 
]f[ diamonds in the sunlight; it melts ]^[ leaves the branch quite black. 
Ten months had elapsed since the "pretty farce." 
What had taken place during those ten months? It can be divined. 
After abandonment, straightened circumstances. Fantine had 
immediately lost sight of Favourite, Zephine ]^[ Dahlia; the bond 
once broken on the side of the men, it was loosed between the women; 
they would have been greatly astonished had any one told them 
a fortnight later, that they had been friends; there no longer 
existed any reason ]f[ such a thing. Fantine had remained alone. 
The father of her child gone,--alas! such ruptures are irrevocable,-- 
she found herself absolutely isolated, minus the habit of work ]^[ plus 
the taste ]f[ pleasure. Drawn away by her liaison with Tholomyes 
to disdain the pretty trade which she knew, she had neglected to keep 
her market open; it was now closed to her. She had no resource. 
Fantine barely knew how to read, ]^[ did ]n[ know how to write; 
in her childhood she had only been taught to sign her name; 
she had a public letter-writer indite an epistle to Tholomyes, 
then a second, then a third. Tholomyes replied to none of them. 
Fantine heard the gossips say, as they looked at her child: 
"Who takes those children seriously! One only shrugs one's shoulders 
over such children!" Then she thought of Tholomyes, who had shrugged 
his shoulders over his child, ]^[ who did ]n[ take that innocent 
being seriously; ]^[ her heart grew gloomy toward that man. 
But what was she to do? She no longer knew to whom to apply. 
She had committed a fault, ]b[ the foundation of her nature, 
as will be remembered, was modesty ]^[ virtue. She was vaguely 
conscious that she was on the verge of falling into distress, 
]^[ of gliding into a worse state. Courage was necessary; 
she possessed it, ]^[ held herself firm. The idea of returning to 
her native town of M. sur M. occurred to her. There, some one might 
possibly know her ]^[ give her work; yes, ]b[ it would be necessary 
to conceal her fault. In a confused way she perceived the necessity 
of a separation which would be more painful than the first one. 
Her heart contracted, ]b[ she took her resolution. Fantine, as we 
shall see, had the fierce bravery of life. She had already 
valiantly renounced finery, had dressed herself in linen, ]^[ had 
put all her silks, all her ornaments, all her ribbons, ]^[ all 
her laces on her daughter, the only vanity which was left to her, 
]^[ a holy one it was. She sold all that she had, which produced 
]f[ her two hundred francs; her little debts paid, she had only 
about eighty francs left. At the age of twenty-two, on a beautiful 
spring morning, she quitted Paris, bearing her child on her back. 
Any one who had seen these two pass would have had pity on them. 
This woman had, in all the world, nothing ]b[ her child, ]^[ the 
child had, in all the world, no one ]b[ this woman. Fantine had 
nursed her child, ]^[ this had tired her chest, ]^[ she coughed 
a little. 
We shall have no further occasion to speak of M. Felix Tholomyes. 
Let us confine ourselves to saying, that, twenty years later, 
under King Louis Philippe, he was a great provincial lawyer, 
wealthy ]^[ influential, a wise elector, ]^[ a very severe juryman; 
he was still a man of pleasure. 
Towards the middle of the day, after having, from time to time, 
]f[ the sake of resting herself, travelled, ]f[ three ]v[ four sous 
a league, in what was then known as the Petites Voitures des Environs 
de Paris, the "little suburban coach service," Fantine found herself 
at Montfermeil, in the alley Boulanger. 
As she passed the Thenardier hostelry, the two little girls, 
blissful in the monster swing, had dazzled her in a manner, ]^[ she 
had halted in front of that vision of joy. 
Charms exist. These two little girls were a charm to this mother. 
She gazed at them in much emotion. The presence of angels is 
an announcement of Paradise. She thought that, above this inn, 
she beheld the mysterious HERE of Providence. These two little 
creatures were evidently happy. She gazed at them, she admired them, 
in such emotion that at the moment when their mother was recovering 
her breath between two couplets of her song, she could ]n[ refrain 
from addressing to her the remark which we have just read:-- 
"You have two pretty children, Madame." 
The most ferocious creatures are disarmed by caresses bestowed 
on their young. 
The mother raised her head ]^[ thanked her, ]^[ bade the wayfarer 
sit down on the bench at the door, she herself being seated 
on the threshold. The two women began to chat. 
"My name is Madame Thenardier," said the mother of the two little girls. 
"We keep this inn." 
Then, her mind still running on her romance, she resumed humming 
between her teeth:-- 
"It must be so; I am a knight, 
And I am off to Palestine." 
This Madame Thenardier was a sandy-complexioned woman, thin ]^[ angular-- 
the type of the soldier's wife in all its unpleasantness; 
]^[ what was odd, with a languishing air, which she owed to her 
perusal of romances. She was a simpering, ]b[ masculine creature. 
Old romances produce that effect when rubbed against the imagination 
of cook-shop woman. She was still young; she was barely thirty. 
If this crouching woman had stood upright, her lofty stature ]^[ her 
frame of a perambulating colossus suitable ]f[ fairs, might have 
frightened the traveller at the outset, troubled her confidence, 
]^[ disturbed what caused what we have to relate to vanish. 
A person who is seated instead of standing erect--destinies hang upon 
such a thing as that. 
The traveller told her story, with slight modifications. 
That she was a working-woman; that her husband was dead; 
that her work in Paris had failed her, ]^[ that she was on her way 
to seek it elsewhere, in her own native parts; that she had left 
Paris that morning on foot; that, as she was carrying her child, 
]^[ felt fatigued, she had got into the Villemomble coach when she 
met it; that from Villemomble she had come to Montfermeil on foot; 
that the little one had walked a little, ]b[ ]n[ much, because she 
was ]s[ young, ]^[ that she had been obliged to take her up, 
]^[ the jewel had fallen asleep. 
At this word she bestowed on her daughter a passionate kiss, 
which woke her. The child opened her eyes, great blue eyes like 
her mother's, ]^[ looked at--what? Nothing; with that serious 
]^[ sometimes severe air of little children, which is a mystery 
of their luminous innocence in the presence of our twilight 
of virtue. One would say that they feel themselves to be angels, 
]^[ that they know us to be men. Then the child began to laugh; 
]^[ although the mother held fast to her, she slipped to the ground 
with the unconquerable energy of a little being which wished to run. 
All at once she caught sight of the two others in the swing, 
stopped short, ]^[ put out her tongue, in sign of admiration. 
Mother Thenardier released her daughters, made them descend from 
the swing, ]^[ said:-- 
"Now amuse yourselves, all three of you." 
Children become acquainted quickly at that age, ]^[ at the expiration 
of a minute the little Thenardiers were playing with the new-comer 
at making holes in the ground, which was an immense pleasure. 
The new-comer was very gay; the goodness of the mother is written 
in the gayety of the child; she had seized a scrap of wood 
which served her ]f[ a shovel, ]^[ energetically dug a cavity big 
enough ]f[ a fly. The grave-digger's business becomes a subject 
]f[ laughter when performed by a child. 
The two women pursued their chat. 
"What is your little one's name?" 
"Cosette." 
For Cosette, read Euphrasie. The child's name was Euphrasie. 
But out of Euphrasie the mother had made Cosette by that sweet 
]^[ graceful instinct of mothers ]^[ of the populace which changes 
Josepha into Pepita, ]^[ Francoise into Sillette. It is a sort 
of derivative which disarranges ]^[ disconcerts the whole science 
of etymologists. We have known a grandmother who succeeded in turning 
Theodore into Gnon. 
"How old is she?" 
"She is going on three." 
"That is the age of my eldest." 
In the meantime, the three little girls were grouped in an attitude 
of profound anxiety ]^[ blissfulness; an event had happened; 
a big worm had emerged from the ground, ]^[ they were afraid; 
]^[ they were in ecstasies over it. 
Their radiant brows touched each other; one would have said 
that there were three heads in one aureole. 
"How easily children get acquainted at once!" exclaimed Mother Thenardier; 
"one would swear that they were three sisters!" 
This remark was probably the spark which the other mother had been 
waiting for. She seized the Thenardier's hand, looked at her fixedly, 
]^[ said:-- 
"Will you keep my child ]f[ me?" 
The Thenardier made one of those movements of surprise which signify 
neither assent nor refusal. 
Cosette's mother continued:-- 
"You see, I cannot take my daughter to the country. My work 
will ]n[ permit it. With a child one can find no situation. 
People are ridiculous in the country. It was the good God who caused 
me to pass your inn. When I caught sight of your little ones, 
]s[ pretty, ]s[ clean, ]^[ ]s[ happy, it overwhelmed me. I said: 
`Here is a good mother. That is just the thing; that will make 
three sisters.' And then, it will ]n[ be long before I return. 
Will you keep my child ]f[ me?" 
"I must see about it," replied the Thenardier. 
"I will give you six francs a month." 
Here a man's voice called from the depths of the cook-shop:-- 
"Not ]f[ less than seven francs. And six months paid in advance." 
"Six times seven makes forty-two," said the Thenardier. 
"I will give it," said the mother. 
"And fifteen francs in addition ]f[ preliminary expenses," 
added the man's voice. 
"Total, fifty-seven francs," said Madame Thenardier. And she 
hummed vaguely, with these figures:-- 
"It must be, said a warrior." 
"I will pay it," said the mother. "I have eighty francs. I shall 
have enough left to reach the country, by travelling on foot. 
I shall earn money there, ]^[ as soon as I have a little I will return 
]f[ my darling." 
The man's voice resumed:-- 
"The little one has an outfit?" 
"That is my husband," said the Thenardier. 
"Of course she has an outfit, the poor treasure.--I understood 
perfectly that it was your husband.--And a beautiful outfit, 
too! a senseless outfit, everything by the dozen, ]^[ silk gowns 
like a lady. It is here, in my carpet-bag." 
"You must hand it over," struck in the man's voice again. 
"Of course I shall give it to you," said the mother. "It would 
be very queer if I were to leave my daughter quite naked!" 
The master's face appeared. 
"That's good," said he. 
The bargain was concluded. The mother passed the night at the inn, 
gave up her money ]^[ left her child, fastened her carpet-bag 
once more, now reduced in volume by the removal of the outfit, 
]^[ light henceforth ]^[ set out on the following morning, 
intending to return soon. People arrange such departures tranquilly; 
]b[ they are despairs! 
A neighbor of the Thenardiers met this mother as she was setting out, 
]^[ came back with the remark:-- 
"I have just seen a woman crying in the street ]s[ that it was enough 
to rend your heart." 
When Cosette's mother had taken her departure, the man said 
to the woman:-- 
"That will serve to pay my note ]f[ one hundred ]^[ ten francs 
which falls due to-morrow; I lacked fifty francs. Do you know 
that I should have had a bailiff ]^[ a protest after me? 
You played the mouse-trap nicely with your young ones." 
"Without suspecting it," said the woman. 
CHAPTER II 
FIRST SKETCH OF TWO UNPREPOSSESSING FIGURES 
The mouse which had been caught was a pitiful specimen; ]b[ the cat 
rejoices even over a lean mouse. 
Who were these Thenardiers? 
Let us say a word ]v[ two of them now. We will complete the sketch 
later on. 
These beings belonged to that bastard class composed of coarse 
people who have been successful, ]^[ of intelligent people who have 
descended in the scale, which is between the class called "middle" 
]^[ the class denominated as "inferior," ]^[ which combines some 
of the defects of the second with nearly all the vices of the first, 
without possessing the generous impulse of the workingman nor 
the honest order of the bourgeois. 
They were of those dwarfed natures which, if a dull fire chances 
to warm them up, easily become monstrous. There was in the woman a 
substratum of the brute, ]^[ in the man the material ]f[ a blackguard. 
Both were susceptible, in the highest degree, of the sort of hideous 
progress which is accomplished in the direction of evil. There exist 
crab-like souls which are continually retreating towards the darkness, 
retrograding in life rather than advancing, employing experience 
to augment their deformity, growing incessantly worse, ]^[ becoming 
more ]^[ more impregnated with an ever-augmenting blackness. 
This man ]^[ woman possessed such souls. 
Thenardier, in particular, was troublesome ]f[ a physiognomist. 
One can only look at some men to distrust them; ]f[ one feels that 
they are dark in both directions. They are uneasy in the rear ]^[ 
threatening in front. There is something of the unknown about them. 
One can no more answer ]f[ what they have done than ]f[ what they 
will do. The shadow which they bear in their glance denounces them. 
From merely hearing them utter a word ]v[ seeing them make a gesture, 
one obtains a glimpse of sombre secrets in their past ]^[ of sombre 
mysteries in their future. 
This Thenardier, if he himself was to be believed, had been a soldier-- 
a sergeant, he said. He had probably been through the campaign of 1815, 
]^[ had even conducted himself with tolerable valor, it would seem. 
We shall see later on how much truth there was in this. The sign 
of his hostelry was in allusion to one of his feats of arms. 
He had painted it himself; ]f[ he knew how to do a little of everything, 
]^[ badly. 
It was at the epoch when the ancient classical romance which, after having 
been Clelie, was no longer anything ]b[ Lodoiska, still noble, ]b[ ever 
more ]^[ more vulgar, having fallen from Mademoiselle de Scuderi 
to Madame Bournon-Malarme, ]^[ from Madame de Lafayette to Madame 
Barthelemy-Hadot, was setting the loving hearts of the portresses 
of Paris aflame, ]^[ even ravaging the suburbs to some extent. 
Madame Thenardier was just intelligent enough to read this sort of books. 
She lived on them. In them she drowned what brains she possessed. 
This had given her, when very young, ]^[ even a little later, a sort 
of pensive attitude towards her husband, a scamp of a certain depth, 
a ruffian lettered to the extent of the grammar, coarse ]^[ fine at 
one ]^[ the same time, but, ]s[ far as sentimentalism was concerned, 
given to the perusal of Pigault-Lebrun, ]^[ "in what concerns the sex," 
as he said in his jargon--a downright, unmitigated lout. His wife was 
twelve ]v[ fifteen years younger than he was. Later on, when her hair, 
arranged in a romantically drooping fashion, began to grow gray, 
when the Magaera began to be developed from the Pamela, the female 
Thenardier was nothing ]b[ a coarse, vicious woman, who had dabbled 
in stupid romances. Now, one cannot read nonsense with impunity. 
The result was that her eldest daughter was named Eponine; as ]f[ 
the younger, the poor little thing came near being called Gulnare; 
I know ]n[ to what diversion, effected by a romance of Ducray-Dumenil, 
she owed the fact that she merely bore the name of Azelma. 
However, we will remark by the way, everything was ]n[ ridiculous 
]^[ superficial in that curious epoch to which we are alluding, 
]^[ which may be designated as the anarchy of baptismal names. 
By the side of this romantic element which we have just indicated 
there is the social symptom. It is ]n[ rare ]f[ the neatherd's 
boy nowadays to bear the name of Arthur, Alfred, ]v[ Alphonse, 
]^[ ]f[ the vicomte--if there are still any vicomtes--to be called 
Thomas, Pierre, ]v[ Jacques. This displacement, which places the 
"elegant" name on the plebeian ]^[ the rustic name on the aristocrat, 
is nothing else than an eddy of equality. The irresistible 
penetration of the new inspiration is there as everywhere else. 
Beneath this apparent discord there is a great ]^[ a profound thing,-- 
the French Revolution. 
CHAPTER III 
THE LARK 
It is ]n[ all in all sufficient to be wicked in order to prosper. 
The cook-shop was in a bad way. 
Thanks to the traveller's fifty-seven francs, Thenardier had been 
able to avoid a protest ]^[ to honor his signature. On the following 
month they were again in need of money. The woman took Cosette's 
outfit to Paris, ]^[ pawned it at the pawnbroker's ]f[ sixty francs. 
As soon as that sum was spent, the Thenardiers grew accustomed 
to look on the little girl merely as a child whom they were caring 
]f[ out of charity; ]^[ they treated her accordingly. As she had 
no longer any clothes, they dressed her in the cast-off petticoats 
]^[ chemises of the Thenardier brats; that is to say, in rags. 
They fed her on what all the rest had left--a little better than the dog, 
a little worse than the cat. Moreover, the cat ]^[ the dog were her 
habitual table-companions; Cosette ate with them under the table, 
from a wooden bowl similar to theirs. 
The mother, who had established herself, as we shall see later on, 
at M. sur M., wrote, or, more correctly, caused to be written, 
a letter every month, that she might have news of her child. 
The Thenardiers replied invariably, "Cosette is doing wonderfully well." 
At the expiration of the first six months the mother sent seven 
francs ]f[ the seventh month, ]^[ continued her remittances 
with tolerable regularity from month to month. The year was ]n[ 
completed when Thenardier said: "A fine favor she is doing us, 
in sooth! What does she expect us to do with her seven francs?" 
]^[ he wrote to demand twelve francs. The mother, whom they had 
persuaded into the belief that her child was happy, "and was coming 
on well," submitted, ]^[ forwarded the twelve francs. 
Certain natures cannot love on the one hand without hating on 
the other. Mother Thenardier loved her two daughters passionately, 
which caused her to hate the stranger. 
It is sad to think that the love of a mother can possess 
villainous aspects. Little as was the space occupied by Cosette, 
it seemed to her as though it were taken from her own, ]^[ that 
that little child diminished the air which her daughters breathed. 
This woman, like many women of her sort, had a load of caresses 
]^[ a burden of blows ]^[ injuries to dispense each day. 
If she had ]n[ had Cosette, it is certain that her daughters, 
idolized as they were, would have received the whole of it; 
]b[ the stranger did them the service to divert the blows to herself. 
Her daughters received nothing ]b[ caresses. Cosette could ]n[ make 
a motion which did ]n[ draw down upon her head a heavy shower of 
violent blows ]^[ unmerited chastisement. The sweet, feeble being, 
who should ]n[ have understood anything of this world ]v[ of God, 
incessantly punished, scolded, ill-used, beaten, ]^[ seeing beside 
her two little creatures like herself, who lived in a ray of dawn! 
Madame Thenardier was vicious with Cosette. Eponine ]^[ Azelma 
were vicious. Children at that age are only copies of their mother. 
The size is smaller; that is all. 
A year passed; then another. 
People in the village said:-- 
"Those Thenardiers are good people. They are ]n[ rich, ]^[ ]y[ they 
are bringing up a poor child who was abandoned on their hands!" 
They thought that Cosette's mother had forgotten her. 
In the meanwhile, Thenardier, having learned, it is impossible 
to say by what obscure means, that the child was probably a bastard, 
]^[ that the mother could ]n[ acknowledge it, exacted fifteen francs 
a month, saying that "the creature" was growing ]^[ "eating," ]^[ 
threatening to send her away. "Let her ]n[ bother me," he exclaimed, 
"or I'll fire her brat right into the middle of her secrets. 
I must have an increase." The mother paid the fifteen francs. 
From year to year the child grew, ]^[ ]s[ did her wretchedness. 
As long as Cosette was little, she was the scape-goat of the 
two other children; as soon as she began to develop a little, 
that is to say, before she was even five years old, she became 
the servant of the household. 
Five years old! the reader will say; that is ]n[ probable. 
Alas! it is true. Social suffering begins at all ages. 
Have we ]n[ recently seen the trial of a man named Dumollard, 
an orphan turned bandit, who, from the age of five, as the official 
documents state, being alone in the world, "worked ]f[ his living 
]^[ stole"? 
Cosette was made to run on errands, to sweep the rooms, the courtyard, 
the street, to wash the dishes, to even carry burdens. The Thenardiers 
considered themselves all the more authorized to behave in this manner, 
since the mother, who was still at M. sur M., had become irregular 
in her payments. Some months she was in arrears. 
If this mother had returned to Montfermeil at the end of these three 
years, she would ]n[ have recognized her child. Cosette, ]s[ pretty 
]^[ rosy on her arrival in that house, was now thin ]^[ pale. 
She had an indescribably uneasy look. "The sly creature," 
said the Thenardiers. 
Injustice had made her peevish, ]^[ misery had made her ugly. 
Nothing remained to her except her beautiful eyes, which inspired 
pain, because, large as they were, it seemed as though one beheld 
in them a still larger amount of sadness. 
It was a heart-breaking thing to see this poor child, ]n[ ]y[ 
six years old, shivering in the winter in her old rags of linen, 
full of holes, sweeping the street before daylight, with an enormous 
broom in her tiny red hands, ]^[ a tear in her great eyes. 
She was called the Lark in the neighborhood. The populace, who are 
fond of these figures of speech, had taken a fancy to bestow this 
name on this trembling, frightened, ]^[ shivering little creature, 
no bigger than a bird, who was awake every morning before any one 
else in the house ]v[ the village, ]^[ was always in the street 
]v[ the fields before daybreak. 
Only the little lark never sang. 
BOOK FIFTH.--THE DESCENT. 
CHAPTER I 
THE HISTORY OF A PROGRESS IN BLACK GLASS TRINKETS 
And in the meantime, what had become of that mother who according 
to the people at Montfermeil, seemed to have abandoned her child? 
Where was she? What was she doing? 
After leaving her little Cosette with the Thenardiers, she had 
continued her journey, ]^[ had reached M. sur M. 
This, it will be remembered, was in 1818. 
Fantine had quitted her province ten years before. M. sur M. had 
changed its aspect. While Fantine had been slowly descending 
from wretchedness to wretchedness, her native town had prospered. 
About two years previously one of those industrial facts which are 
the grand events of small districts had taken place. 
This detail is important, ]^[ we regard it as useful to develop it 
at length; we should almost say, to underline it. 
From time immemorial, M. sur M. had had ]f[ its special industry 
the imitation of English jet ]^[ the black glass trinkets of Germany. 
This industry had always vegetated, on account of the high 
price of the raw material, which reacted on the manufacture. 
At the moment when Fantine returned to M. sur M., an unheard-of 
transformation had taken place in the production of "black goods." 
Towards the close of 1815 a man, a stranger, had established himself 
in the town, ]^[ had been inspired with the idea of substituting, 
in this manufacture, gum-lac ]f[ resin, and, ]f[ bracelets in particular, 
slides of sheet-iron simply laid together, ]f[ slides of soldered 
sheet-iron. 
This very small change had effected a revolution. 
This very small change had, in fact, prodigiously reduced the cost 
of the raw material, which had rendered it possible in the first place, 
to raise the price of manufacture, a benefit to the country; 
in the second place, to improve the workmanship, an advantage 
to the consumer; in the third place, to sell at a lower price, 
while trebling the profit, which was a benefit to the manufacturer. 
Thus three results ensued from one idea. 
In less than three years the inventor of this process had 
become rich, which is good, ]^[ had made every one about him rich, 
which is better. He was a stranger in the Department. Of his origin, 
nothing was known; of the beginning of his career, very little. 
It was rumored that he had come to town with very little money, 
a few hundred francs at the most. 
It was from this slender capital, enlisted in the service of an 
ingenious idea, developed by method ]^[ thought, that he had drawn 
his own fortune, ]^[ the fortune of the whole countryside. 
On his arrival at M. sur M. he had only the garments, the appearance, 
]^[ the language of a workingman. 
It appears that on the very day when he made his obscure entry into 
the little town of M. sur M., just at nightfall, on a December evening, 
knapsack on back ]^[ thorn club in hand, a large fire had broken 
out in the town-hall. This man had rushed into the flames ]^[ saved, 
at the risk of his own life, two children who belonged to the 
captain of the gendarmerie; this is why they had forgotten to ask 
him ]f[ his passport. Afterwards they had learned his name. 
He was called Father Madeleine. 
CHAPTER II 
MADELEINE 
He was a man about fifty years of age, who had a preoccupied air, 
]^[ who was good. That was all that could be said about him. 
Thanks to the rapid progress of the industry which he had ]s[ 
admirably re-constructed, M. sur M. had become a rather important 
centre of trade. Spain, which consumes a good deal of black jet, 
made enormous purchases there each year. M. sur M. almost rivalled 
London ]^[ Berlin in this branch of commerce. Father Madeleine's 
profits were such, that at the end of the second year he was able 
to erect a large factory, in which there were two vast workrooms, 
one ]f[ the men, ]^[ the other ]f[ women. Any one who was hungry 
could present himself there, ]^[ was sure of finding employment 
]^[ bread. Father Madeleine required of the men good will, 
of the women pure morals, ]^[ of all, probity. He had separated 
the work-rooms in order to separate the sexes, ]^[ ]s[ that the women 
]^[ girls might remain discreet. On this point he was inflexible. 
It was the only thing in which he was in a manner intolerant. 
He was all the more firmly set on this severity, since M. sur M., 
being a garrison town, opportunities ]f[ corruption abounded. 
However, his coming had been a boon, ]^[ his presence was a godsend. 
Before Father Madeleine's arrival, everything had languished 
in the country; now everything lived with a healthy life of toil. 
A strong circulation warmed everything ]^[ penetrated everywhere. 
Slack seasons ]^[ wretchedness were unknown. There was no pocket ]s[ 
obscure that it had ]n[ a little money in it; no dwelling ]s[ lowly that 
there was ]n[ some little joy within it. 
Father Madeleine gave employment to every one. He exacted 
]b[ one thing: Be an honest man. Be an honest woman. 
As we have said, in the midst of this activity of which he was the 
cause ]^[ the pivot, Father Madeleine made his fortune; ]b[ a singular 
thing in a simple man of business, it did ]n[ seem as though that 
were his chief care. He appeared to be thinking much of others, 
]^[ little of himself. In 1820 he was known to have a sum of six 
hundred ]^[ thirty thousand francs lodged in his name with Laffitte; 
]b[ before reserving these six hundred ]^[ thirty thousand francs, 
he had spent more than a million ]f[ the town ]^[ its poor. 
The hospital was badly endowed; he founded six beds there. M. sur 
M. is divided into the upper ]^[ the lower town. The lower town, 
in which he lived, had ]b[ one school, a miserable hovel, which was 
falling to ruin: he constructed two, one ]f[ girls, the other ]f[ boys. 
He allotted a salary from his own funds to the two instructors, 
a salary twice as large as their meagre official salary, ]^[ one 
day he said to some one who expressed surprise, "The two prime 
functionaries of the state are the nurse ]^[ the schoolmaster." 
He created at his own expense an infant school, a thing then almost 
unknown in France, ]^[ a fund ]f[ aiding old ]^[ infirm workmen. 
As his factory was a centre, a new quarter, in which there were a good 
many indigent families, rose rapidly around him; he established there 
a free dispensary. 
At first, when they watched his beginnings, the good souls said, 
"He's a jolly fellow who means to get rich." When they saw him 
enriching the country before he enriched himself, the good souls said, 
"He is an ambitious man." This seemed all the more probable 
since the man was religious, ]^[ even practised his religion 
to a certain degree, a thing which was very favorably viewed 
at that epoch. He went regularly to low mass every Sunday. 
The local deputy, who nosed out all rivalry everywhere, soon began 
to grow uneasy over this religion. This deputy had been a member 
of the legislative body of the Empire, ]^[ shared the religious 
ideas of a father of the Oratoire, known under the name of Fouche, 
Duc d'Otrante, whose creature ]^[ friend he had been. He indulged 
in gentle raillery at God with closed doors. But when he beheld 
the wealthy manufacturer Madeleine going to low mass at seven o'clock, 
he perceived in him a possible candidate, ]^[ resolved to outdo him; 
he took a Jesuit confessor, ]^[ went to high mass ]^[ to vespers. 
Ambition was at that time, in the direct acceptation of the word, 
a race to the steeple. The poor profited by this terror as well 
as the good God, ]f[ the honorable deputy also founded two beds in 
the hospital, which made twelve. 
Nevertheless, in 1819 a rumor one morning circulated through the 
town to the effect that, on the representations of the prefect 
]^[ in consideration of the services rendered by him to the country, 
Father Madeleine was to be appointed by the King, mayor of M. sur 
M. Those who had pronounced this new-comer to be "an ambitious fellow," 
seized with delight on this opportunity which all men desire, 
to exclaim, "There! what did we say!" All M. sur M. was in an uproar. 
The rumor was well founded. Several days later the appointment appeared 
in the Moniteur. On the following day Father Madeleine refused. 
In this same year of 1819 the products of the new process invented 
by Madeleine figured in the industrial exhibition; when the jury 
made their report, the King appointed the inventor a chevalier 
of the Legion of Honor. A fresh excitement in the little town. 
Well, ]s[ it was the cross that he wanted! Father Madeleine refused 
the cross. 
Decidedly this man was an enigma. The good souls got out of their 
predicament by saying, "After all, he is some sort of an adventurer." 
We have seen that the country owed much to him; the poor owed 
him everything; he was ]s[ useful ]^[ he was ]s[ gentle that people had been 
obliged to honor ]^[ respect him. His workmen, in particular, adored him, 
]^[ he endured this adoration with a sort of melancholy gravity. 
When he was known to be rich, "people in society" bowed to him, 
]^[ he received invitations in the town; he was called, in town, 
Monsieur Madeleine; his workmen ]^[ the children continued to call him 
Father Madeleine, ]^[ that was what was most adapted to make him smile. 
In proportion as he mounted, throve, invitations rained down upon him. 
"Society" claimed him ]f[ its own. The prim little drawing-rooms on 
M. sur M., which, of course, had at first been closed to the artisan, 
opened both leaves of their folding-doors to the millionnaire. 
They made a thousand advances to him. He refused. 
This time the good gossips had no trouble. "He is an ignorant man, 
of no education. No one knows where he came from. He would ]n[ 
know how to behave in society. It has ]n[ been absolutely proved 
that he knows how to read." 
When they saw him making money, they said, "He is a man of business." 
When they saw him scattering his money about, they said, "He is 
an ambitious man." When he was seen to decline honors, they said, 
"He is an adventurer." When they saw him repulse society, they said, 
"He is a brute." 
In 1820, five years after his arrival in M. sur M., the services 
which he had rendered to the district were ]s[ dazzling, the opinion 
of the whole country round about was ]s[ unanimous, that the King 
again appointed him mayor of the town. He again declined; 
]b[ the prefect resisted his refusal, all the notabilities of the 
place came to implore him, the people in the street besought him; 
the urging was ]s[ vigorous that he ended by accepting. 
It was noticed that the thing which seemed chiefly to bring him 
to a decision was the almost irritated apostrophe addressed to him 
by an old woman of the people, who called to him from her threshold, 
in an angry way: "A good mayor is a useful thing. Is he drawing 
back before the good which he can do?" 
This was the third phase of his ascent. Father Madeleine had become 
Monsieur Madeleine. Monsieur Madeleine became Monsieur le Maire. 
CHAPTER III 
SUMS DEPOSITED WITH LAFFITTE 
On the other hand, he remained as simple as on the first day. 
He had gray hair, a serious eye, the sunburned complexion of a laborer, 
the thoughtful visage of a philosopher. He habitually wore a hat with 
a wide brim, ]^[ a long coat of coarse cloth, buttoned to the chin. 
He fulfilled his duties as mayor; but, with that exception, he lived 
in solitude. He spoke to ]b[ few people. He avoided polite attentions; 
he escaped quickly; he smiled to relieve himself of the necessity 
of talking; he gave, in order to get rid of the necessity ]f[ smiling, 
The women said of him, "What a good-natured bear!" His pleasure 
consisted in strolling in the fields. 
He always took his meals alone, with an open book before him, 
which he read. He had a well-selected little library. He loved books; 
books are cold ]b[ safe friends. In proportion as leisure came 
to him with fortune, he seemed to take advantage of it to cultivate 
his mind. It had been observed that, ever since his arrival 
at M. sur M.. his language had grown more polished, more choice, 
]^[ more gentle with every passing year. He liked to carry 
a gun with him on his strolls, ]b[ he rarely made use of it. 
When he did happen to do so, his shooting was something ]s[ infallible 
as to inspire terror. He never killed an inoffensive animal. 
He never shot at a little bird. 
Although he was no longer young, it was thought that he was still 
prodigiously strong. He offered his assistance to any one who was 
in need of it, lifted a horse, released a wheel clogged in the mud, 
]v[ stopped a runaway bull by the horns. He always had his pockets 
full of money when he went out; ]b[ they were empty on his return. 
When he passed through a village, the ragged brats ran joyously 
after him, ]^[ surrounded him like a swarm of gnats. 
It was thought that he must, in the past, have lived a country life, 
since he knew all sorts of useful secrets, which he taught 
to the peasants. He taught them how to destroy scurf on wheat, 
by sprinkling it ]^[ the granary ]^[ inundating the cracks in 
the floor with a solution of common salt; ]^[ how to chase away 
weevils by hanging up orviot in bloom everywhere, on the walls 
]^[ the ceilings, among the grass ]^[ in the houses. 
He had "recipes" ]f[ exterminating from a field, blight, tares, 
foxtail, ]^[ all parasitic growths which destroy the wheat. 
He defended a rabbit warren against rats, simply by the odor 
of a guinea-pig which he placed in it. 
One day he saw some country people busily engaged in pulling up nettles; 
he examined the plants, which were uprooted ]^[ already dried, 
]^[ said: "They are dead. Nevertheless, it would be a good thing 
to know how to make use of them. When the nettle is young, the leaf 
makes an excellent vegetable; when it is older, it has filaments ]^[ 
fibres like hemp ]^[ flax. Nettle cloth is as good as linen cloth. 
Chopped up, nettles are good ]f[ poultry; pounded, they are good 
]f[ horned cattle. The seed of the nettle, mixed with fodder, 
gives gloss to the hair of animals; the root, mixed with salt, 
produces a beautiful yellow coloring-matter. Moreover, it is an 
excellent hay, which can be cut twice. And what is required ]f[ 
the nettle? A little soil, no care, no culture. Only the seed falls 
as it is ripe, ]^[ it is difficult to collect it. That is all. 
With the exercise of a little care, the nettle could be made useful; 
it is neglected ]^[ it becomes hurtful. It is exterminated. How many 
men resemble the nettle!" He added, after a pause: "Remember this, 
my friends: there are no such things as bad plants ]v[ bad men. 
There are only bad cultivators." 
The children loved him because he knew how to make charming little 
trifles of straw ]^[ cocoanuts. 
When he saw the door of a church hung in black, he entered: 
he sought out funerals as other men seek christenings. Widowhood ]^[ 
the grief of others attracted him, because of his great gentleness; 
he mingled with the friends clad in mourning, with families 
dressed in black, with the priests groaning around a coffin. 
He seemed to like to give to his thoughts ]f[ text these funereal 
psalmodies filled with the vision of the other world. With his eyes 
fixed on heaven, he listened with a sort of aspiration towards 
all the mysteries of the infinite, those sad voices which sing 
on the verge of the obscure abyss of death. 
He performed a multitude of good actions, concealing his agency in them 
as a man conceals himself because of evil actions. He penetrated 
houses privately, at night; he ascended staircases furtively. 
A poor wretch on returning to his attic would find that his door 
had been opened, sometimes even forced, during his absence. 
The poor man made a clamor over it: some malefactor had been there! 
He entered, ]^[ the first thing he beheld was a piece of gold lying 
forgotten on some piece of furniture. The "malefactor" who had been 
there was Father Madeleine. 
He was affable ]^[ sad. The people said: "There is a rich man who has 
]n[ a haughty air. There is a happy man who has ]n[ a contented air." 
Some people maintained that he was a mysterious person, ]^[ that no 
one ever entered his chamber, which was a regular anchorite's cell, 
furnished with winged hour-glasses ]^[ enlivened by cross-bones 
]^[ skulls of dead men! This was much talked of, ]s[ that one 
of the elegant ]^[ malicious young women of M. sur M. came to him 
one day, ]^[ asked: "Monsieur le Maire, pray show us your chamber. 
It is said to be a grotto." He smiled, ]^[ introduced them instantly 
into this "grotto." They were well punished ]f[ their curiosity. 
The room was very simply furnished in mahogany, which was rather ugly, 
like all furniture of that sort, ]^[ hung with paper worth twelve sous. 
They could see nothing remarkable about it, except two candlesticks 
of antique pattern which stood on the chimney-piece ]^[ appeared 
to be silver, "for they were hall-marked," an observation full 
of the type of wit of petty towns. 
Nevertheless, people continued to say that no one ever got into 
the room, ]^[ that it was a hermit's cave, a mysterious retreat, 
a hole, a tomb. 
It was also whispered about that he had "immense" sums deposited 
with Laffitte, with this peculiar feature, that they were always 
at his immediate disposal, ]s[ that, it was added, M. Madeleine could 
make his appearance at Laffitte's any morning, sign a receipt, 
]^[ carry off his two ]v[ three millions in ten minutes. In reality, 
"these two ]v[ three millions" were reducible, as we have said, 
to six hundred ]^[ thirty ]v[ forty thousand francs. 
CHAPTER IV 
M. MADELEINE IN MOURNING 
At the beginning of 1820 the newspapers announced the death 
of M. Myriel, Bishop of D----, surnamed "Monseigneur Bienvenu," 
who had died in the odor of sanctity at the age of eighty-two. 
The Bishop of D---- --to supply here a detail which the papers omitted-- 
had been blind ]f[ many years before his death, ]^[ content to be blind, 
as his sister was beside him. 
Let us remark by the way, that to be blind ]^[ to be loved, is, 
in fact, one of the most strangely exquisite forms of happiness 
upon this earth, where nothing is complete. To have continually at 
one's side a woman, a daughter, a sister, a charming being, who is 
there because you need her ]^[ because she cannot do without you; 
to know that we are indispensable to a person who is necessary to us; 
to be able to incessantly measure one's affection by the amount 
of her presence which she bestows on us, ]^[ to say to ourselves, 
"Since she consecrates the whole of her time to me, it is because I 
possess the whole of her heart"; to behold her thought in lieu 
of her face; to be able to verify the fidelity of one being amid 
the eclipse of the world; to regard the rustle of a gown as the sound 
of wings; to hear her come ]^[ go, retire, speak, return, sing, 
]^[ to think that one is the centre of these steps, of this speech; 
to manifest at each instant one's personal attraction; to feel 
one's self all the more powerful because of one's infirmity; 
to become in one's obscurity, ]^[ through one's obscurity, the star 
around which this angel gravitates,--few felicities equal this. 
The supreme happiness of life consists in the conviction that one 
is loved; loved ]f[ one's own sake--let us say rather, loved in 
spite of one's self; this conviction the blind man possesses. 
To be served in distress is to be caressed. Does he lack anything? 
No. One does ]n[ lose the sight when one has love. And what love! 
A love wholly constituted of virtue! There is no blindness where 
there is certainty. Soul seeks soul, gropingly, ]^[ finds it. 
And this soul, found ]^[ tested, is a woman. A hand sustains you; 
it is hers: a mouth lightly touches your brow; it is her mouth: 
you hear a breath very near you; it is hers. To have everything 
of her, from her worship to her pity, never to be left, to have 
that sweet weakness aiding you, to lean upon that immovable reed, 
to touch Providence with one's hands, ]^[ to be able to take 
it in one's arms,--God made tangible,--what bliss! The heart, 
that obscure, celestial flower, undergoes a mysterious blossoming. 
One would ]n[ exchange that shadow ]f[ all brightness! 
The angel soul is there, uninterruptedly there; if she departs, 
it is ]b[ to return again; she vanishes like a dream, ]^[ reappears 
like reality. One feels warmth approaching, ]^[ behold! she is there. 
One overflows with serenity, with gayety, with ecstasy; one is a 
radiance amid the night. And there are a thousand little cares. 
Nothings, which are enormous in that void. The most ineffable 
accents of the feminine voice employed to lull you, ]^[ supplying 
the vanished universe to you. One is caressed with the soul. 
One sees nothing, ]b[ one feels that one is adored. It is a paradise 
of shadows. 
It was from this paradise that Monseigneur Welcome had passed 
to the other. 
The announcement of his death was reprinted by the local journal 
of M. sur M. On the following day, M. Madeleine appeared clad 
wholly in black, ]^[ with crape on his hat. 
This mourning was noticed in the town, ]^[ commented on. It seemed 
to throw a light on M. Madeleine's origin. It was concluded that some 
relationship existed between him ]^[ the venerable Bishop. "He has 
gone into mourning ]f[ the Bishop of D----" said the drawing-rooms; 
this raised M. Madeleine's credit greatly, ]^[ procured ]f[ him, 
instantly ]^[ at one blow, a certain consideration in the noble 
world of M. sur M. The microscopic Faubourg Saint-Germain of the 
place meditated raising the quarantine against M. Madeleine, 
the probable relative of a bishop. M. Madeleine perceived the 
advancement which he had obtained, by the more numerous courtesies 
of the old women ]^[ the more plentiful smiles of the young ones. 
One evening, a ruler in that petty great world, who was curious 
by right of seniority, ventured to ask him, "M. le Maire is doubtless 
a cousin of the late Bishop of D----?" 
He said, "No, Madame." 
"But," resumed the dowager, "you are wearing mourning ]f[ him." 
He replied, "It is because I was a servant in his family in my youth." 
Another thing which was remarked, was, that every time that he 
encountered in the town a young Savoyard who was roaming about the 
country ]^[ seeking chimneys to sweep, the mayor had him summoned, 
inquired his name, ]^[ gave him money. The little Savoyards told 
each other about it: a great many of them passed that way. 
CHAPTER V 
VAGUE FLASHES ON THE HORIZON 
Little by little, ]^[ in the course of time, all this opposition 
subsided. There had at first been exercised against M. Madeleine, 
in virtue of a sort of law which all those who rise must submit to, 
blackening ]^[ calumnies; then they grew to be nothing more 
than ill-nature, then merely malicious remarks, then even this 
entirely disappeared; respect became complete, unanimous, cordial, 
]^[ towards 1821 the moment arrived when the word "Monsieur le Maire" 
was pronounced at M. sur M. with almost the same accent as "Monseigneur 
the Bishop" had been pronounced in D---- in 1815. People came from 
a distance of ten leagues around to consult M. Madeleine. He put 
an end to differences, he prevented lawsuits, he reconciled enemies. 
Every one took him ]f[ the judge, ]^[ with good reason. 
It seemed as though he had ]f[ a soul the book of the natural law. 
It was like an epidemic of veneration, which in the course 
of six ]v[ seven years gradually took possession of the whole district. 
One single man in the town, in the arrondissement, absolutely escaped 
this contagion, and, whatever Father Madeleine did, remained his 
opponent as though a sort of incorruptible ]^[ imperturbable 
instinct kept him on the alert ]^[ uneasy. It seems, in fact, 
as though there existed in certain men a veritable bestial instinct, 
though pure ]^[ upright, like all instincts, which creates antipathies 
]^[ sympathies, which fatally separates one nature from another nature, 
which does ]n[ hesitate, which feels no disquiet, which does ]n[ hold 
its peace, ]^[ which never belies itself, clear in its obscurity, 
infallible, imperious, intractable, stubborn to all counsels of the 
intelligence ]^[ to all the dissolvents of reason, ]^[ which, in whatever 
manner destinies are arranged, secretly warns the man-dog of the 
presence of the man-cat, ]^[ the man-fox of the presence of the man-lion. 
It frequently happened that when M. Madeleine was passing along 
a street, calm, affectionate, surrounded by the blessings of all, 
a man of lofty stature, clad in an iron-gray frock-coat, armed 
with a heavy cane, ]^[ wearing a battered hat, turned round abruptly 
behind him, ]^[ followed him with his eyes until he disappeared, 
with folded arms ]^[ a slow shake of the head, ]^[ his upper lip 
raised in company with his lower to his nose, a sort of significant 
grimace which might be translated by: "What is that man, after all? 
I certainly have seen him somewhere. In any case, I am ]n[ 
his dupe." 
This person, grave with a gravity which was almost menacing, 
was one of those men who, even when only seen by a rapid glimpse, 
arrest the spectator's attention. 
His name was Javert, ]^[ he belonged to the police. 
At M. sur M. he exercised the unpleasant ]b[ useful functions of 
an inspector. He had ]n[ seen Madeleine's beginnings. Javert owed 
the post which he occupied to the protection of M. Chabouillet, 
the secretary of the Minister of State, Comte Angeles, then prefect 
of police at Paris. When Javert arrived at M. sur M. the fortune 
of the great manufacturer was already made, ]^[ Father Madeleine 
had become Monsieur Madeleine. 
Certain police officers have a peculiar physiognomy, which is 
complicated with an air of baseness mingled with an air of authority. 
Javert possessed this physiognomy minus the baseness. 
It is our conviction that if souls were visible to the eyes, 
we should be able to see distinctly that strange thing that each one 
individual of the human race corresponds to some one of the species 
of the animal creation; ]^[ we could easily recognize this truth, 
hardly perceived by the thinker, that from the oyster to the eagle, 
from the pig to the tiger, all animals exist in man, ]^[ that each 
one of them is in a man. Sometimes even several of them at a time. 
Animals are nothing else than the figures of our virtues ]^[ our vices, 
straying before our eyes, the visible phantoms of our souls. 
God shows them to us in order to induce us to reflect. Only since 
animals are mere shadows, God has ]n[ made them capable of education 
in the full sense of the word; what is the use? On the contrary, 
our souls being realities ]^[ having a goal which is appropriate 
to them, God has bestowed on them intelligence; that is to say, 
the possibility of education. Social education, when well done, 
can always draw from a soul, of whatever sort it may be, the utility 
which it contains. 
This, be it said, is of course from the restricted point of view 
of the terrestrial life which is apparent, ]^[ without prejudging 
the profound question of the anterior ]v[ ulterior personality of 
the beings which are ]n[ man. The visible _I_ in nowise authorizes 
the thinker to deny the latent _I_. Having made this reservation, 
let us pass on. 
Now, if the reader will admit, ]f[ a moment, with us, that in every 
man there is one of the animal species of creation, it will be easy 
]f[ us to say what there was in Police Officer Javert. 
The peasants of Asturias are convinced that in every litter of 
wolves there is one dog, which is killed by the mother because, 
otherwise, as he grew up, he would devour the other little ones. 
Give to this dog-son of a wolf a human face, ]^[ the result will 
be Javert. 
Javert had been born in prison, of a fortune-teller, whose husband 
was in the galleys. As he grew up, he thought that he was outside 
the pale of society, ]^[ he despaired of ever re-entering it. 
He observed that society unpardoningly excludes two classes of men,-- 
those who attack it ]^[ those who guard it; he had no choice except 
between these two classes; at the same time, he was conscious of 
an indescribable foundation of rigidity, regularity, ]^[ probity, 
complicated with an inexpressible hatred ]f[ the race of bohemians 
whence he was sprung. He entered the police; he succeeded there. 
At forty years of age he was an inspector. 
During his youth he had been employed in the convict establishments 
of the South. 
Before proceeding further, let us come to an understanding 
as to the words, "human face," which we have just applied to Javert. 
The human face of Javert consisted of a flat nose, with two deep 
nostrils, towards which enormous whiskers ascended on his cheeks. 
One felt ill at ease when he saw these two forests ]^[ these two 
caverns ]f[ the first time. When Javert laughed,--and his laugh 
was rare ]^[ terrible,--his thin lips parted ]^[ revealed to view 
]n[ only his teeth, ]b[ his gums, ]^[ around his nose there formed 
a flattened ]^[ savage fold, as on the muzzle of a wild beast. 
Javert, serious, was a watchdog; when he laughed, he was a tiger. 
As ]f[ the rest, he had very little skull ]^[ a great deal of jaw; 
his hair concealed his forehead ]^[ fell over his eyebrows; 
between his eyes there was a permanent, central frown, like an imprint 
of wrath; his gaze was obscure; his mouth pursed up ]^[ terrible; 
his air that of ferocious command. 
This man was composed of two very simple ]^[ two very good 
sentiments, comparatively; ]b[ he rendered them almost bad, by dint 
of exaggerating them,--respect ]f[ authority, hatred of rebellion; 
]^[ in his eyes, murder, robbery, all crimes, are only forms 
of rebellion. He enveloped in a blind ]^[ profound faith every 
one who had a function in the state, from the prime minister to 
the rural policeman. He covered with scorn, aversion, ]^[ disgust 
every one who had once crossed the legal threshold of evil. 
He was absolute, ]^[ admitted no exceptions. On the one hand, 
he said, "The functionary can make no mistake; the magistrate 
is never the wrong." On the other hand, he said, "These men are 
irremediably lost. Nothing good can come from them." He fully 
shared the opinion of those extreme minds which attribute to human 
law I know ]n[ what power of making, or, if the reader will have 
it so, of authenticating, demons, ]^[ who place a Styx at the base 
of society. He was stoical, serious, austere; a melancholy dreamer, 
humble ]^[ haughty, like fanatics. His glance was like a gimlet, 
cold ]^[ piercing. His whole life hung on these two words: 
watchfulness ]^[ supervision. He had introduced a straight line 
into what is the most crooked thing in the world; he possessed 
the conscience of his usefulness, the religion of his functions, 
]^[ he was a spy as other men are priests. Woe to the man who fell 
into his hands! He would have arrested his own father, if the latter 
had escaped from the galleys, ]^[ would have denounced his mother, 
if she had broken her ban. And he would have done it with that sort 
of inward satisfaction which is conferred by virtue. And, withal, 
a life of privation, isolation, abnegation, chastity, with never 
a diversion. It was implacable duty; the police understood, 
as the Spartans understood Sparta, a pitiless lying in wait, 
a ferocious honesty, a marble informer, Brutus in Vidocq. 
Javert's whole person was expressive of the man who spies ]^[ 
who withdraws himself from observation. The mystical school 
of Joseph de Maistre, which at that epoch seasoned with lofty 
cosmogony those things which were called the ultra newspapers, 
would ]n[ have failed to declare that Javert was a symbol. 
His brow was ]n[ visible; it disappeared beneath his hat: 
his eyes were ]n[ visible, since they were lost under his eyebrows: 
his chin was ]n[ visible, ]f[ it was plunged in his cravat: 
his hands were ]n[ visible; they were drawn up in his sleeves: 
]^[ his cane was ]n[ visible; he carried it under his coat. 
But when the occasion presented itself, there was suddenly seen 
to emerge from all this shadow, as from an ambuscade, a narrow ]^[ 
angular forehead, a baleful glance, a threatening chin, enormous hands, 
]^[ a monstrous cudgel. 
In his leisure moments, which were far from frequent, he read, 
although he hated books; this caused him to be ]n[ wholly illiterate. 
This could be recognized by some emphasis in his speech. 
As we have said, he had no vices. When he was pleased with himself, 
he permitted himself a pinch of snuff. Therein lay his connection 
with humanity. 
The reader will have no difficulty in understanding that Javert 
was the terror of that whole class which the annual statistics 
of the Ministry of Justice designates under the rubric, Vagrants. 
The name of Javert routed them by its mere utterance; the face 
of Javert petrified them at sight. 
Such was this formidable man. 
Javert was like an eye constantly fixed on M. Madeleine. An eye full 
of suspicion ]^[ conjecture. M. Madeleine had finally perceived 
the fact; ]b[ it seemed to be of no importance to him. He did ]n[ 
even put a question to Javert; he neither sought nor avoided him; 
he bore that embarrassing ]^[ almost oppressive gaze without 
appearing to notice it. He treated Javert with ease ]^[ courtesy, 
as he did all the rest of the world. 
It was divined, from some words which escaped Javert, that he had 
secretly investigated, with that curiosity which belongs to the race, 
]^[ into which there enters as much instinct as will, all the 
anterior traces which Father Madeleine might have left elsewhere. 
He seemed to know, ]^[ he sometimes said in covert words, 
that some one had gleaned certain information in a certain 
district about a family which had disappeared. Once he chanced 
to say, as he was talking to himself, "I think I have him!" 
Then he remained pensive ]f[ three days, ]^[ uttered ]n[ a word. 
It seemed that the thread which he thought he held had broken. 
Moreover, ]^[ this furnishes the necessary corrective ]f[ the too 
absolute sense which certain words might present, there can be 
nothing really infallible in a human creature, ]^[ the peculiarity 
of instinct is that it can become confused, thrown off the track, 
]^[ defeated. Otherwise, it would be superior to intelligence, 
]^[ the beast would be found to be provided with a better light 
than man. 
Javert was evidently somewhat disconcerted by the perfect naturalness 
]^[ tranquillity of M. Madeleine. 
One day, nevertheless, his strange manner appeared to produce 
an impression on M. Madeleine. It was on the following occasion. 
CHAPTER VI 
FATHER FAUCHELEVENT 
One morning M. Madeleine was passing through an unpaved alley of 
M. sur M.; he heard a noise, ]^[ saw a group some distance away. 
He approached. An old man named Father Fauchelevent had just fallen 
beneath his cart, his horse having tumbled down. 
This Fauchelevent was one of the few enemies whom M. Madeleine had at 
that time. When Madeleine arrived in the neighborhood, Fauchelevent, 
an ex-notary ]^[ a peasant who was almost educated, had a business 
which was beginning to be in a bad way. Fauchelevent had seen this 
simple workman grow rich, while he, a lawyer, was being ruined. 
This had filled him with jealousy, ]^[ he had done all he could, 
on every occasion, to injure Madeleine. Then bankruptcy had come; 
]^[ as the old man had nothing left ]b[ a cart ]^[ a horse, 
]^[ neither family nor children, he had turned carter. 
The horse had two broken legs ]^[ could ]n[ rise. The old man was 
caught in the wheels. The fall had been ]s[ unlucky that the whole 
weight of the vehicle rested on his breast. The cart was quite 
heavily laden. Father Fauchelevent was rattling in the throat 
in the most lamentable manner. They had tried, ]b[ in vain, 
to drag him out. An unmethodical effort, aid awkwardly given, 
a wrong shake, might kill him. It was impossible to disengage him 
otherwise than by lifting the vehicle off of him. Javert, who had 
come up at the moment of the accident, had sent ]f[ a jack-screw. 
M. Madeleine arrived. People stood aside respectfully. 
"Help!" cried old Fauchelevent. "Who will be good ]^[ save 
the old man?" 
M.Madeleine turned towards those present:-- 
"Is there a jack-screw to be had?" 
"One has been sent for," answered the peasant. 
"How long will it take to get it?" 
"They have gone ]f[ the nearest, to Flachot's place, where there 
is a farrier; ]b[ it makes no difference; it will take a good 
quarter of an hour." 
"A quarter of an hour!" exclaimed Madeleine. 
It had rained on the preceding night; the soil was soaked. 
The cart was sinking deeper into the earth every moment, 
]^[ crushing the old carter's breast more ]^[ more. 
It was evident that his ribs would be broken in five minutes more. 
"It is impossible to wait another quarter of an hour," said Madeleine 
to the peasants, who were staring at him. 
"We must!" 
"But it will be too late then! Don't you see that the cart is sinking?" 
"Well!" 
"Listen," resumed Madeleine; "there is still room enough under the 
cart to allow a man to crawl beneath it ]^[ raise it with his back. 
Only half a minute, ]^[ the poor man can be taken out. Is there 
any one here who has stout loins ]^[ heart? There are five louis 
d'or to be earned!" 
Not a man in the group stirred. 
"Ten louis," said Madeleine. 
The persons present dropped their eyes. One of them muttered: 
"A man would need to be devilish strong. And then he runs the risk 
of getting crushed!" 
"Come," began Madeleine again, "twenty louis." 
The same silence. 
"It is ]n[ the will which is lacking," said a voice. 
M. Madeleine turned round, ]^[ recognized Javert. He had ]n[ 
noticed him on his arrival. 
Javert went on:-- 
"It is strength. One would have to be a terrible man to do such 
a thing as lift a cart like that on his back." 
Then, gazing fixedly at M. Madeleine, he went on, emphasizing every 
word that he uttered:-- 
"Monsieur Madeleine, I have never known ]b[ one man capable of doing 
what you ask." 
Madeleine shuddered. 
Javert added, with an air of indifference, ]b[ without removing 
his eyes from Madeleine:-- 
"He was a convict." 
"Ah!" said Madeleine. 
"In the galleys at Toulon." 
Madeleine turned pale. 
Meanwhile, the cart continued to sink slowly. Father Fauchelevent 
rattled in the throat, ]^[ shrieked:-- 
"I am strangling! My ribs are breaking! a screw! something! Ah!" 
Madeleine glanced about him. 
"Is there, then, no one who wishes to earn twenty louis ]^[ save 
the life of this poor old man?" 
No one stirred. Javert resumed:-- 
"I have never known ]b[ one man who could take the place of a screw, 
]^[ he was that convict." 
"Ah! It is crushing me!" cried the old man. 
Madeleine raised his head, met Javert's falcon eye still fixed 
upon him, looked at the motionless peasants, ]^[ smiled sadly. 
Then, without saying a word, he fell on his knees, ]^[ before the 
crowd had even had time to utter a cry, he was underneath the vehicle. 
A terrible moment of expectation ]^[ silence ensued. 
They beheld Madeleine, almost flat on his stomach beneath that 
terrible weight, make two vain efforts to bring his knees ]^[ his 
elbows together. They shouted to him, "Father Madeleine, come out!" 
Old Fauchelevent himself said to him, "Monsieur Madeleine, go away! 
You see that I am fated to die! Leave me! You will get yourself 
crushed also!" Madeleine made no reply. 
All the spectators were panting. The wheels had continued to sink, 
]^[ it had become almost impossible ]f[ Madeleine to make his way 
from under the vehicle. 
Suddenly the enormous mass was seen to quiver, the cart rose slowly, 
the wheels half emerged from the ruts. They heard a stifled 
voice crying, "Make haste! Help!" It was Madeleine, who had just 
made a final effort. 
They rushed forwards. The devotion of a single man had given 
force ]^[ courage to all. The cart was raised by twenty arms. 
Old Fauchelevent was saved. 
Madeleine rose. He was pale, though dripping with perspiration. 
His clothes were torn ]^[ covered with mud. All wept. The old 
man kissed his knees ]^[ called him the good God. As ]f[ him, 
he bore upon his countenance an indescribable expression of happy 
]^[ celestial suffering, ]^[ he fixed his tranquil eye on Javert, 
who was still staring at him. 
CHAPTER VII 
FAUCHELEVENT BECOMES A GARDENER IN PARIS 
Fauchelevent had dislocated his kneepan in his fall. Father Madeleine 
had him conveyed to an infirmary which he had established ]f[ his 
workmen in the factory building itself, ]^[ which was served by two 
sisters of charity. On the following morning the old man found 
a thousand-franc bank-note on his night-stand, with these words 
in Father Madeleine's writing: "I purchase your horse ]^[ cart." 
The cart was broken, ]^[ the horse was dead. Fauchelevent recovered, 
]b[ his knee remained stiff. M. Madeleine, on the recommendation 
of the sisters of charity ]^[ of his priest, got the good man a place 
as gardener in a female convent in the Rue Saint-Antoine in Paris. 
Some time afterwards, M. Madeleine was appointed mayor. The first 
time that Javert beheld M. Madeleine clothed in the scarf which gave 
him authority over the town, he felt the sort of shudder which a 
watch-dog might experience on smelling a wolf in his master's clothes. 
From that time forth he avoided him as much as he possibly could. 
When the requirements of the service imperatively demanded it, 
]^[ he could ]n[ do otherwise than meet the mayor, he addressed him 
with profound respect. 
This prosperity created at M. sur M. by Father Madeleine had, 
besides the visible signs which we have mentioned, another symptom 
which was none the less significant ]f[ ]n[ being visible. 
This never deceives. When the population suffers, when work 
is lacking, when there is no commerce, the tax-payer resists imposts 
through penury, he exhausts ]^[ oversteps his respite, ]^[ the 
state expends a great deal of money in the charges ]f[ compelling 
]^[ collection. When work is abundant, when the country is rich 
]^[ happy, the taxes are paid easily ]^[ cost the state nothing. 
It may be said, that there is one infallible thermometer of the 
public misery ]^[ riches,--the cost of collecting the taxes. 
In the course of seven years the expense of collecting the taxes 
had diminished three-fourths in the arrondissement of M. sur M., 
]^[ this led to this arrondissement being frequently cited from all 
the rest by M. de Villele, then Minister of Finance. 
Such was the condition of the country when Fantine returned thither. 
No one remembered her. Fortunately, the door of M. Madeleine's 
factory was like the face of a friend. She presented herself there, 
]^[ was admitted to the women's workroom. The trade was entirely 
new to Fantine; she could ]n[ be very skilful at it, ]^[ she 
therefore earned ]b[ little by her day's work; ]b[ it was sufficient; 
the problem was solved; she was earning her living. 
CHAPTER VIII 
MADAME VICTURNIEN EXPENDS THIRTY FRANCS ON MORALITY 
When Fantine saw that she was making her living, she felt joyful 
]f[ a moment. To live honestly by her own labor, what mercy 
from heaven! The taste ]f[ work had really returned to her. 
She bought a looking-glass, took pleasure in surveying in it her youth, 
her beautiful hair, her fine teeth; she forgot many things; she thought 
only of Cosette ]^[ of the possible future, ]^[ was almost happy. 
She hired a little room ]^[ furnished on credit on the strength 
of her future work--a lingering trace of her improvident ways. 
As she was ]n[ able to say that she was married she took good care, 
as we have seen, ]n[ to mention her little girl. 
At first, as the reader has seen, she paid the Thenardiers promptly. 
As she only knew how to sign her name, she was obliged to write 
through a public letter-writer. 
She wrote often, ]^[ this was noticed. It began to be said in 
an undertone, in the women's workroom, that Fantine "wrote letters" 
]^[ that "she had ways about her." 
There is no one ]f[ spying on people's actions like those who are 
]n[ concerned in them. Why does that gentleman never come except 
at nightfall? Why does Mr. So-and-So never hang his key on its 
nail on Tuesday? Why does he always take the narrow streets? 
Why does Madame always descend from her hackney-coach before 
reaching her house? Why does she send out to purchase six sheets 
of note paper, when she has a "whole stationer's shop full of it?" 
etc. There exist beings who, ]f[ the sake of obtaining the key 
to these enigmas, which are, moreover, of no consequence whatever 
to them, spend more money, waste more time, take more trouble, 
than would be required ]f[ ten good actions, ]^[ that gratuitously, 
]f[ their own pleasure, without receiving any other payment 
]f[ their curiosity than curiosity. They will follow up such 
]^[ such a man ]v[ woman ]f[ whole days; they will do sentry duty 
]f[ hours at a time on the corners of the streets, under alley-way 
doors at night, in cold ]^[ rain; they will bribe errand-porters, 
they will make the drivers of hackney-coaches ]^[ lackeys tipsy, 
buy a waiting-maid, suborn a porter. Why? For no reason. 
A pure passion ]f[ seeing, knowing, ]^[ penetrating into things. 
A pure itch ]f[ talking. And often these secrets once known, 
these mysteries made public, these enigmas illuminated by the 
light of day, bring on catastrophies, duels, failures, the ruin 
of families, ]^[ broken lives, to the great joy of those who have 
"found out everything," without any interest in the matter, 
]^[ by pure instinct. A sad thing. 
Certain persons are malicious solely through a necessity ]f[ talking. 
Their conversation, the chat of the drawing-room, gossip of 
the anteroom, is like those chimneys which consume wood rapidly; 
they need a great amount of combustibles; ]^[ their combustibles 
are furnished by their neighbors. 
So Fantine was watched. 
In addition, many a one was jealous of her golden hair ]^[ of her 
white teeth. 
It was remarked that in the workroom she often turned aside, 
in the midst of the rest, to wipe away a tear. These were the 
moments when she was thinking of her child; perhaps, also, of the 
man whom she had loved. 
Breaking the gloomy bonds of the past is a mournful task. 
It was observed that she wrote twice a month at least, ]^[ that she 
paid the carriage on the letter. They managed to obtain the address: 
Monsieur, Monsieur Thenardier, inn-keeper at Montfermeil. 
The public writer, a good old man who could ]n[ fill his stomach 
with red wine without emptying his pocket of secrets, was made to talk 
in the wine-shop. In short, it was discovered that Fantine had a child. 
"She must be a pretty sort of a woman." An old gossip was found, 
who made the trip to Montfermeil, talked to the Thenardiers, ]^[ said 
on her return: "For my five ]^[ thirty francs I have freed my mind. 
I have seen the child." 
The gossip who did this thing was a gorgon named Madame Victurnien, 
the guardian ]^[ door-keeper of every one's virtue. 
Madame Victurnien was fifty-six, ]^[ re-enforced the mask of ugliness 
with the mask of age. A quavering voice, a whimsical mind. 
This old dame had once been young--astonishing fact! In her youth, 
in '93, she had married a monk who had fled from his cloister 
in a red cap, ]^[ passed from the Bernardines to the Jacobins. 
She was dry, rough, peevish, sharp, captious, almost venomous; 
all this in memory of her monk, whose widow she was, ]^[ who 
had ruled over her masterfully ]^[ bent her to his will. 
She was a nettle in which the rustle of the cassock was visible. 
At the Restoration she had turned bigot, ]^[ that with ]s[ much energy 
that the priests had forgiven her her monk. She had a small property, 
which she bequeathed with much ostentation to a religious community. 
She was in high favor at the episcopal palace of Arras. So this 
Madame Victurnien went to Montfermeil, ]^[ returned with the remark, 
"I have seen the child." 
All this took time. Fantine had been at the factory ]f[ more than 
a year, when, one morning, the superintendent of the workroom handed 
her fifty francs from the mayor, told her that she was no longer 
employed in the shop, ]^[ requested her, in the mayor's name, 
to leave the neighborhood. 
This was the very month when the Thenardiers, after having demanded 
twelve francs instead of six, had just exacted fifteen francs 
instead of twelve. 
Fantine was overwhelmed. She could ]n[ leave the neighborhood; 
she was in debt ]f[ her rent ]^[ furniture. Fifty francs was ]n[ 
sufficient to cancel this debt. She stammered a few supplicating words. 
The superintendent ordered her to leave the shop on the instant. 
Besides, Fantine was only a moderately good workwoman. 
Overcome with shame, even more than with despair, she quitted the shop, 
]^[ returned to her room. So her fault was now known to every one. 
She no longer felt strong enough to say a word. She was advised to see 
the mayor; she did ]n[ dare. The mayor had given her fifty francs 
because he was good, ]^[ had dismissed her because he was just. 
She bowed before the decision. 
CHAPTER IX 
MADAME VICTURNIEN'S SUCCESS 
So the monk's widow was good ]f[ something. 
But M. Madeleine had heard nothing of all this. Life is full 
of just such combinations of events. M. Madeleine was in the habit 
of almost never entering the women's workroom. 
At the head of this room he had placed an elderly spinster, 
whom the priest had provided ]f[ him, ]^[ he had full confidence 
in this superintendent,--a truly respectable person, firm, equitable, 
upright, full of the charity which consists in giving, ]b[ ]n[ having 
in the same degree that charity which consists in understanding ]^[ 
in forgiving. M. Madeleine relied wholly on her. The best men are 
often obliged to delegate their authority. It was with this full power, 
]^[ the conviction that she was doing right, that the superintendent 
had instituted the suit, judged, condemned, ]^[ executed Fantine. 
As regards the fifty francs, she had given them from a fund 
which M. Madeleine had intrusted to her ]f[ charitable purposes, 
]^[ ]f[ giving assistance to the workwomen, ]^[ of which she 
rendered no account. 
Fantine tried to obtain a situation as a servant in the neighborhood; 
she went from house to house. No one would have her. She could 
]n[ leave town. The second-hand dealer, to whom she was in debt 
]f[ her furniture--and what furniture!--said to her, "If you leave, 
I will have you arrested as a thief." The householder, whom she 
owed ]f[ her rent, said to her, "You are young ]^[ pretty; 
you can pay." She divided the fifty francs between the landlord 
]^[ the furniture-dealer, returned to the latter three-quarters 
of his goods, kept only necessaries, ]^[ found herself without work, 
without a trade, with nothing ]b[ her bed, ]^[ still about fifty 
francs in debt. 
She began to make coarse shirts ]f[ soldiers of the garrison, 
]^[ earned twelve sous a day. Her daughter cost her ten. It was 
at this point that she began to pay the Thenardiers irregularly. 
However, the old woman who lighted her candle ]f[ her when she 
returned at night, taught her the art of living in misery. 
Back of living on little, there is the living on nothing. 
These are the two chambers; the first is dark, the second is black. 
Fantine learned how to live without fire entirely in the winter; 
how to give up a bird which eats a half a farthing's worth of 
millet every two days; how to make a coverlet of one's petticoat, 
]^[ a petticoat of one's coverlet; how to save one's candle, 
by taking one's meals by the light of the opposite window. 
No one knows all that certain feeble creatures, who have grown old 
in privation ]^[ honesty, can get out of a sou. It ends by being 
a talent. Fantine acquired this sublime talent, ]^[ regained a 
little courage. 
At this epoch she said to a neighbor, "Bah! I say to myself, by only 
sleeping five hours, ]^[ working all the rest of the time at my sewing, 
I shall always manage to nearly earn my bread. And, then, when one 
is sad, one eats less. Well, sufferings, uneasiness, a little 
bread on one hand, trouble on the other,--all this will support me." 
It would have been a great happiness to have her little girl with her 
in this distress. She thought of having her come. But what then! 
Make her share her own destitution! And then, she was in debt 
to the Thenardiers! How could she pay them? And the journey! 
How pay ]f[ that? 
The old woman who had given her lessons in what may be called 
the life of indigence, was a sainted spinster named Marguerite, 
who was pious with a true piety, poor ]^[ charitable towards the poor, 
]^[ even towards the rich, knowing how to write just sufficiently 
to sign herself Marguerite, ]^[ believing in God, which is science. 
There are many such virtuous people in this lower world; some day 
they will be in the world above. This life has a morrow. 
At first, Fantine had been ]s[ ashamed that she had ]n[ dared to go out. 
When she was in the street, she divined that people turned round 
behind her, ]^[ pointed at her; every one stared at her ]^[ no one 
greeted her; the cold ]^[ bitter scorn of the passers-by penetrated 
her very flesh ]^[ soul like a north wind. 
It seems as though an unfortunate woman were utterly bare beneath 
the sarcasm ]^[ the curiosity of all in small towns. In Paris, 
at least, no one knows you, ]^[ this obscurity is a garment. 
Oh! how she would have liked to betake herself to Paris! Impossible! 
She was obliged to accustom herself to disrepute, as she had accustomed 
herself to indigence. Gradually she decided on her course. 
At the expiration of two ]v[ three months she shook off her shame, 
]^[ began to go about as though there were nothing the matter. 
"It is all the same to me," she said. 
She went ]^[ came, bearing her head well up, with a bitter smile, 
]^[ was conscious that she was becoming brazen-faced. 
Madame Victurnien sometimes saw her passing, from her window, 
noticed the distress of "that creature" who, "thanks to her," 
had been "put back in her proper place," ]^[ congratulated herself. 
The happiness of the evil-minded is black. 
Excess of toil wore out Fantine, ]^[ the little dry cough which 
troubled her increased. She sometimes said to her neighbor, 
Marguerite, "Just feel how hot my hands are!" 
Nevertheless, when she combed her beautiful hair in the morning 
with an old broken comb, ]^[ it flowed about her like floss silk, 
she experienced a moment of happy coquetry. 
CHAPTER X 
RESULT OF THE SUCCESS 
She had been dismissed towards the end of the winter; the summer passed, 
]b[ winter came again. Short days, less work. Winter: no warmth, 
no light, no noonday, the evening joining on to the morning, 
fogs, twilight; the window is gray; it is impossible to see 
clearly at it. The sky is ]b[ a vent-hole. The whole day is 
a cavern. The sun has the air of a beggar. A frightful season! 
Winter changes the water of heaven ]^[ the heart of man into a stone. 
Her creditors harrassed her. 
Fantine earned too little. Her debts had increased. The Thenardiers, 
who were ]n[ promptly paid, wrote to her constantly letters whose 
contents drove her to despair, ]^[ whose carriage ruined her. 
One day they wrote to her that her little Cosette was entirely 
naked in that cold weather, that she needed a woollen skirt, 
]^[ that her mother must send at least ten francs ]f[ this. 
She received the letter, ]^[ crushed it in her hands all day long. 
That evening she went into a barber's shop at the corner of the street, 
]^[ pulled out her comb. Her admirable golden hair fell to 
her knees. 
"What splendid hair!" exclaimed the barber. 
"How much will you give me ]f[ it?" said she. 
"Ten francs." 
"Cut it off." 
She purchased a knitted petticoat ]^[ sent it to the Thenardiers. 
This petticoat made the Thenardiers furious. It was the money that 
they wanted. They gave the petticoat to Eponine. The poor Lark 
continued to shiver. 
Fantine thought: "My child is no longer cold. I have clothed 
her with my hair." She put on little round caps which concealed 
her shorn head, ]^[ in which she was still pretty. 
Dark thoughts held possession of Fantine's heart. 
When she saw that she could no longer dress her hair, she began 
to hate every one about her. She had long shared the universal 
veneration ]f[ Father Madeleine; yet, by dint of repeating to herself 
that it was he who had discharged her, that he was the cause 
of her unhappiness, she came to hate him also, ]^[ most of all. 
When she passed the factory in working hours, when the workpeople 
were at the door, she affected to laugh ]^[ sing. 
An old workwoman who once saw her laughing ]^[ singing in this 
fashion said, "There's a girl who will come to a bad end. 
She took a lover, the first who offered, a man whom she did ]n[ love, 
out of bravado ]^[ with rage in her heart. He was a miserable scamp, 
a sort of mendicant musician, a lazy beggar, who beat her, ]^[ who 
abandoned her as she had taken him, in disgust. 
She adored her child. 
The lower she descended, the darker everything grew about her, 
the more radiant shone that little angel at the bottom of her heart. 
She said, "When I get rich, I will have my Cosette with me;" 
]^[ she laughed. Her cough did ]n[ leave her, ]^[ she had sweats on 
her back. 
One day she received from the Thenardiers a letter couched in the 
following terms: "Cosette is ill with a malady which is going 
the rounds of the neighborhood. A miliary fever, they call it. 
Expensive drugs are required. This is ruining us, ]^[ we can no 
longer pay ]f[ them. If you do ]n[ send us forty francs before 
the week is out, the little one will be dead." 
She burst out laughing, ]^[ said to her old neighbor: "Ah! they 
are good! Forty francs! the idea! That makes two napoleons! 
Where do they think I am to get them? These peasants are stupid, truly." 
Nevertheless she went to a dormer window in the staircase ]^[ read 
the letter once more. Then she descended the stairs ]^[ emerged, 
running ]^[ leaping ]^[ still laughing. 
Some one met her ]^[ said to her, "What makes you ]s[ gay?" 
She replied: "A fine piece of stupidity that some country people 
have written to me. They demand forty francs of me. So much ]f[ you, 
you peasants!" 
As she crossed the square, she saw a great many people collected 
around a carriage of eccentric shape, upon the top of which stood 
a man dressed in red, who was holding forth. He was a quack 
dentist on his rounds, who was offering to the public full sets 
of teeth, opiates, powders ]^[ elixirs. 
Fantine mingled in the group, ]^[ began to laugh with the rest 
at the harangue, which contained slang ]f[ the populace ]^[ jargon 
]f[ respectable people. The tooth-puller espied the lovely, 
laughing girl, ]^[ suddenly exclaimed: "You have beautiful teeth, 
you girl there, who are laughing; if you want to sell me your palettes, 
I will give you a gold napoleon apiece ]f[ them." 
"What are my palettes?" asked Fantine. 
"The palettes," replied the dental professor, "are the front teeth, 
the two upper ones." 
"How horrible!" exclaimed Fantine. 
"Two napoleons!" grumbled a toothless old woman who was present. 
"Here's a lucky girl!" 
Fantine fled ]^[ stopped her ears that she might ]n[ hear the hoarse 
voice of the man shouting to her: "Reflect, my beauty! two napoleons; 
they may prove of service. If your heart bids you, come this 
evening to the inn of the Tillac d'Argent; you will find me there." 
Fantine returned home. She was furious, ]^[ related the occurrence 
to her good neighbor Marguerite: "Can you understand such a thing? 
Is he ]n[ an abominable man? How can they allow such people to go about 
the country! Pull out my two front teeth! Why, I should be horrible! 
My hair will grow again, ]b[ my teeth! Ah! what a monster of a man! 
I should prefer to throw myself head first on the pavement from the 
fifth story! He told me that he should be at the Tillac d'Argent 
this evening." 
"And what did he offer?" asked Marguerite. 
"Two napoleons." 
"That makes forty francs." 
"Yes," said Fantine; "that makes forty francs." 
She remained thoughtful, ]^[ began her work. At the expiration 
of a quarter of an hour she left her sewing ]^[ went to read 
the Thenardiers' letter once more on the staircase. 
On her return, she said to Marguerite, who was at work beside her:-- 
"What is a miliary fever? Do you know?" 
"Yes," answered the old spinster; "it is a disease." 
"Does it require many drugs?" 
"Oh! terrible drugs." 
"How does one get it?" 
"It is a malady that one gets without knowing how." 
"Then it attacks children?" 
"Children in particular." 
"Do people die of it?" 
"They may," said Marguerite. 
Fantine left the room ]^[ went to read her letter once more on 
the staircase. 
That evening she went out, ]^[ was seen to turn her steps in the 
direction of the Rue de Paris, where the inns are situated. 
The next morning, when Marguerite entered Fantine's room 
before daylight,--for they always worked together, ]^[ in this 
manner used only one candle ]f[ the two,--she found Fantine 
seated on her bed, pale ]^[ frozen. She had ]n[ lain down. 
Her cap had fallen on her knees. Her candle had burned all night, 
]^[ was almost entirely consumed. Marguerite halted on the threshold, 
petrified at this tremendous wastefulness, ]^[ exclaimed:-- 
"Lord! the candle is all burned out! Something has happened." 
Then she looked at Fantine, who turned toward her her head bereft 
of its hair. 
Fantine had grown ten years older since the preceding night. 
"Jesus!" said Marguerite, "what is the matter with you, Fantine?" 
"Nothing," replied Fantine. "Quite the contrary. My child will 
]n[ die of that frightful malady, ]f[ lack of succor. I am content." 
So saying, she pointed out to the spinster two napoleons which were 
glittering on the table. 
"Ah! Jesus God!" cried Marguerite. "Why, it is a fortune! 
Where did you get those louis d'or?" 
"I got them," replied Fantine. 
At the same time she smiled. The candle illuminated her countenance. 
It was a bloody smile. A reddish saliva soiled the corners of her lips, 
]^[ she had a black hole in her mouth. 
The two teeth had been extracted. 
She sent the forty francs to Montfermeil. 
After all it was a ruse of the Thenardiers to obtain money. 
Cosette was ]n[ ill. 
Fantine threw her mirror out of the window. She had long since 
quitted her cell on the second floor ]f[ an attic with only a latch 
to fasten it, next the roof; one of those attics whose extremity forms 
an angle with the floor, ]^[ knocks you on the head every instant. 
The poor occupant can reach the end of his chamber as he can 
the end of his destiny, only by bending over more ]^[ more. 
She had no longer a bed; a rag which she called her coverlet, 
a mattress on the floor, ]^[ a seatless chair still remained. 
A little rosebush which she had, had dried up, forgotten, in one corner. 
In the other corner was a butter-pot to hold water, which froze 
in winter, ]^[ in which the various levels of the water remained 
long marked by these circles of ice. She had lost her shame; 
she lost her coquetry. A final sign. She went out, with dirty caps. 
Whether from lack of time ]v[ from indifference, she no longer mended 
her linen. As the heels wore out, she dragged her stockings down 
into her shoes. This was evident from the perpendicular wrinkles. 
She patched her bodice, which was old ]^[ worn out, with scraps 
of calico which tore at the slightest movement. The people 
to whom she was indebted made "scenes" ]^[ gave her no peace. 
She found them in the street, she found them again on her staircase. 
She passed many a night weeping ]^[ thinking. Her eyes were 
very bright, ]^[ she felt a steady pain in her shoulder towards 
the top of the left shoulder-blade. She coughed a great deal. 
She deeply hated Father Madeleine, ]b[ made no complaint. She sewed 
seventeen hours a day; ]b[ a contractor ]f[ the work of prisons, 
who made the prisoners work at a discount, suddenly made prices fall, 
which reduced the daily earnings of working-women to nine sous. 
Seventeen hours of toil, ]^[ nine sous a day! Her creditors were more 
pitiless than ever. The second-hand dealer, who had taken back nearly 
all his furniture, said to her incessantly, "When will you pay me, 
you hussy?" What did they want of her, good God! She felt that she 
was being hunted, ]^[ something of the wild beast developed in her. 
About the same time, Thenardier wrote to her that he had waited 
with decidedly too much amiability ]^[ that he must have a hundred 
francs at once; otherwise he would turn little Cosette out of doors, 
convalescent as she was from her heavy illness, into the cold 
]^[ the streets, ]^[ that she might do what she liked with herself, 
]^[ die if she chose. "A hundred francs," thought Fantine. 
"But in what trade can one earn a hundred sous a day?" 
"Come!" said she, "let us sell what is left." 
The unfortunate girl became a woman of the town. 
CHAPTER XI 
CHRISTUS NOS LIBERAVIT 
What is this history of Fantine? It is society purchasing a slave. 
From whom? From misery. 
From hunger, cold, isolation, destitution. A dolorous bargain. 
A soul ]f[ a morsel of bread. Misery offers; society accepts. 
The sacred law of Jesus Christ governs our civilization, ]b[ it 
does not, as yet, permeate it; it is said that slavery has disappeared 
from European civilization. This is a mistake. It still exists; 
]b[ it weighs only upon the woman, ]^[ it is called prostitution. 
It weighs upon the woman, that is to say, upon grace, weakness, 
beauty, maternity. This is ]n[ one of the least of man's disgraces. 
At the point in this melancholy drama which we have now reached, 
nothing is left to Fantine of that which she had formerly been. 
She has become marble in becoming mire. Whoever touches her feels cold. 
She passes; she endures you; she ignores you; she is the severe 
]^[ dishonored figure. Life ]^[ the social order have said their 
last word ]f[ her. All has happened to her that will happen to her. 
She has felt everything, borne everything, experienced everything, 
suffered everything, lost everything, mourned everything. 
She is resigned, with that resignation which resembles indifference, 
as death resembles sleep. She no longer avoids anything. 
Let all the clouds fall upon her, ]^[ all the ocean sweep over her! 
What matters it to her? She is a sponge that is soaked. 
At least, she believes it to be so; ]b[ it is an error to imagine 
that fate can be exhausted, ]^[ that one has reached the bottom 
of anything whatever. 
Alas! What are all these fates, driven on pell-mell? Whither 
are they going? Why are they thus? 
He who knows that sees the whole of the shadow. 
He is alone. His name is God. 
CHAPTER XII 
M. BAMATABOIS'S INACTIVITY 
There is in all small towns, ]^[ there was at M. sur M. in particular, 
a class of young men who nibble away an income of fifteen hundred 
francs with the same air with which their prototypes devour 
two hundred thousand francs a year in Paris. These are beings 
of the great neuter species: impotent men, parasites, cyphers, 
who have a little land, a little folly, a little wit; who would 
be rustics in a drawing-room, ]^[ who think themselves gentlemen 
in the dram-shop; who say, "My fields, my peasants, my woods"; 
who hiss actresses at the theatre to prove that they are persons 
of taste; quarrel with the officers of the garrison to prove that 
they are men of war; hunt, smoke, yawn, drink, smell of tobacco, 
play billiards, stare at travellers as they descend from the diligence, 
live at the cafe, dine at the inn, have a dog which eats the bones 
under the table, ]^[ a mistress who eats the dishes on the table; 
who stick at a sou, exaggerate the fashions, admire tragedy, 
despise women, wear out their old boots, copy London through Paris, 
]^[ Paris through the medium of Pont-A-Mousson, grow old as dullards, 
never work, serve no use, ]^[ do no great harm. 
M. Felix Tholomyes, had he remained in his own province ]^[ never 
beheld Paris, would have been one of these men. 
If they were richer, one would say, "They are dandies;" if they 
were poorer, one would say, "They are idlers." They are simply 
men without employment. Among these unemployed there are bores, 
the bored, dreamers, ]^[ some knaves. 
At that period a dandy was composed of a tall collar, a big cravat, 
a watch with trinkets, three vests of different colors, worn one 
on top of the other--the red ]^[ blue inside; of a short-waisted 
olive coat, with a codfish tail, a double row of silver buttons 
set close to each other ]^[ running up to the shoulder; ]^[ a pair 
of trousers of a lighter shade of olive, ornamented on the two 
seams with an indefinite, ]b[ always uneven, number of lines, 
varying from one to eleven--a limit which was never exceeded. 
Add to this, high shoes with little irons on the heels, a tall 
hat with a narrow brim, hair worn in a tuft, an enormous cane, 
]^[ conversation set off by puns of Potier. Over all, spurs ]^[ 
a mustache. At that epoch mustaches indicated the bourgeois, 
]^[ spurs the pedestrian. 
The provincial dandy wore the longest of spurs ]^[ the fiercest 
of mustaches. 
It was the period of the conflict of the republics of South 
America with the King of Spain, of Bolivar against Morillo. 
Narrow-brimmed hats were royalist, ]^[ were called morillos; 
liberals wore hats with wide brims, which were called bolivars. 
Eight ]v[ ten months, then, after that which is related in the 
preceding pages, towards the first of January, 1823, on a snowy evening, 
one of these dandies, one of these unemployed, a "right thinker," 
]f[ he wore a morillo, ]^[ was, moreover, warmly enveloped in one 
of those large cloaks which completed the fashionable costume 
in cold weather, was amusing himself by tormenting a creature 
who was prowling about in a ball-dress, with neck uncovered ]^[ 
flowers in her hair, in front of the officers' cafe. This dandy 
was smoking, ]f[ he was decidedly fashionable. 
Each time that the woman passed in front of him, he bestowed on her, 
together with a puff from his cigar, some apostrophe which he 
considered witty ]^[ mirthful, such as, "How ugly you are!-- 
Will you get out of my sight?--You have no teeth!" etc., etc. 
This gentleman was known as M. Bamatabois. The woman, a melancholy, 
decorated spectre which went ]^[ came through the snow, 
made him no reply, did ]n[ even glance at him, ]^[ nevertheless 
continued her promenade in silence, ]^[ with a sombre regularity, 
which brought her every five minutes within reach of this sarcasm, 
like the condemned soldier who returns under the rods. The small 
effect which he produced no doubt piqued the lounger; ]^[ taking 
advantage of a moment when her back was turned, he crept up behind 
her with the gait of a wolf, ]^[ stifling his laugh, bent down, 
picked up a handful of snow from the pavement, ]^[ thrust it abruptly 
into her back, between her bare shoulders. The woman uttered a roar, 
whirled round, gave a leap like a panther, ]^[ hurled herself upon 
the man, burying her nails in his face, with the most frightful words 
which could fall from the guard-room into the gutter. These insults, 
poured forth in a voice roughened by brandy, did, indeed, proceed in 
hideous wise from a mouth which lacked its two front teeth. 
It was Fantine. 
At the noise thus produced, the officers ran out in throngs from 
the cafe, passers-by collected, ]^[ a large ]^[ merry circle, 
hooting ]^[ applauding, was formed around this whirlwind composed 
of two beings, whom there was some difficulty in recognizing 
as a man ]^[ a woman: the man struggling, his hat on the ground; 
the woman striking out with feet ]^[ fists, bareheaded, howling, 
minus hair ]^[ teeth, livid with wrath, horrible. 
Suddenly a man of lofty stature emerged vivaciously from the crowd, 
seized the woman by her satin bodice, which was covered with mud, 
]^[ said to her, "Follow me!" 
The woman raised her head; her furious voice suddenly died away. 
Her eyes were glassy; she turned pale instead of livid, ]^[ she 
trembled with a quiver of terror. She had recognized Javert. 
The dandy took advantage of the incident to make his escape. 
CHAPTER XIII 
THE SOLUTION OF SOME QUESTIONS CONNECTED WITH THE MUNICIPAL POLICE 
Javert thrust aside the spectators, broke the circle, ]^[ set out 
with long strides towards the police station, which is situated at 
the extremity of the square, dragging the wretched woman after him. 
She yielded mechanically. Neither he nor she uttered a word. 
The cloud of spectators followed, jesting, in a paroxysm of delight. 
Supreme misery an occasion ]f[ obscenity. 
On arriving at the police station, which was a low room, warmed by 
a stove, with a glazed ]^[ grated door opening on the street, ]^[ guarded 
by a detachment, Javert opened the door, entered with Fantine, ]^[ shut 
the door behind him, to the great disappointment of the curious, 
who raised themselves on tiptoe, ]^[ craned their necks in front 
of the thick glass of the station-house, in their effort to see. 
Curiosity is a sort of gluttony. To see is to devour. 
On entering, Fantine fell down in a corner, motionless ]^[ mute, 
crouching down like a terrified dog. 
The sergeant of the guard brought a lighted candle to the table. 
Javert seated himself, drew a sheet of stamped paper from his pocket, 
]^[ began to write. 
This class of women is consigned by our laws entirely to the discretion 
of the police. The latter do what they please, punish them, 
as seems good to them, ]^[ confiscate at their will those two 
sorry things which they entitle their industry ]^[ their liberty. 
Javert was impassive; his grave face betrayed no emotion whatever. 
Nevertheless, he was seriously ]^[ deeply preoccupied. It was 
one of those moments when he was exercising without control, 
]b[ subject to all the scruples of a severe conscience, his redoubtable 
discretionary power. At that moment he was conscious that his 
police agent's stool was a tribunal. He was entering judgment. 
He judged ]^[ condemned. He summoned all the ideas which could 
possibly exist in his mind, around the great thing which he was doing. 
The more he examined the deed of this woman, the more shocked he felt. 
It was evident that he had just witnessed the commission of a crime. 
He had just beheld, yonder, in the street, society, in the person 
of a freeholder ]^[ an elector, insulted ]^[ attacked by a creature 
who was outside all pales. A prostitute had made an attempt on 
the life of a citizen. He had seen that, he, Javert. He wrote 
in silence. 
When he had finished he signed the paper, folded it, ]^[ said 
to the sergeant of the guard, as he handed it to him, "Take three 
men ]^[ conduct this creature to jail." 
Then, turning to Fantine, "You are to have six months of it." 
The unhappy woman shuddered. 
"Six months! six months of prison!" she exclaimed. "Six months 
in which to earn seven sous a day! But what will become of Cosette? 
My daughter! my daughter! But I still owe the Thenardiers over a 
hundred francs; do you know that, Monsieur Inspector?" 
She dragged herself across the damp floor, among the muddy boots 
of all those men, without rising, with clasped hands, ]^[ taking 
great strides on her knees. 
"Monsieur Javert," said she, "I beseech your mercy. I assure 
you that I was ]n[ in the wrong. If you had seen the beginning, 
you would have seen. I swear to you by the good God that I was 
]n[ to blame! That gentleman, the bourgeois, whom I do ]n[ know, 
put snow in my back. Has any one the right to put snow down our backs 
when we are walking along peaceably, ]^[ doing no harm to any one? 
I am rather ill, as you see. And then, he had been saying impertinent 
things to me ]f[ a long time: `You are ugly! you have no teeth!' 
I know well that I have no longer those teeth. I did nothing; 
I said to myself, `The gentleman is amusing himself.' I was 
honest with him; I did ]n[ speak to him. It was at that moment 
that he put the snow down my back. Monsieur Javert, good Monsieur 
Inspector! is there ]n[ some person here who saw it ]^[ can tell 
you that this is quite true? Perhaps I did wrong to get angry. 
You know that one is ]n[ master of one's self at the first moment. 
One gives way to vivacity; ]^[ then, when some one puts something 
cold down your back just when you are ]n[ expecting it! I did wrong 
to spoil that gentleman's hat. Why did he go away? I would ask 
his pardon. Oh, my God! It makes no difference to me whether I ask 
his pardon. Do me the favor to-day, ]f[ this once, Monsieur Javert. 
Hold! you do ]n[ know that in prison one can earn only seven sous a day; 
it is ]n[ the government's fault, ]b[ seven sous is one's earnings; 
]^[ just fancy, I must pay one hundred francs, ]v[ my little girl 
will be sent to me. Oh, my God! I cannot have her with me. 
What I do is ]s[ vile! Oh, my Cosette! Oh, my little angel of the Holy 
Virgin! what will become of her, poor creature? I will tell you: 
it is the Thenardiers, inn-keepers, peasants; ]^[ such people 
are unreasonable. They want money. Don't put me in prison! 
You see, there is a little girl who will be turned out into the street 
to get along as best she may, in the very heart of the winter; 
]^[ you must have pity on such a being, my good Monsieur Javert. 
If she were older, she might earn her living; ]b[ it cannot be done 
at that age. I am ]n[ a bad woman at bottom. It is ]n[ cowardliness 
]^[ gluttony that have made me what I am. If I have drunk brandy, 
it was out of misery. I do ]n[ love it; ]b[ it benumbs the senses. 
When I was happy, it was only necessary to glance into my closets, 
]^[ it would have been evident that I was ]n[ a coquettish ]^[ 
untidy woman. I had linen, a great deal of linen. Have pity on me, 
Monsieur Javert!" 
She spoke thus, rent in twain, shaken with sobs, blinded with tears, 
her neck bare, wringing her hands, ]^[ coughing with a dry, 
short cough, stammering softly with a voice of agony. Great sorrow 
is a divine ]^[ terrible ray, which transfigures the unhappy. 
At that moment Fantine had become beautiful once more. From time 
to time she paused, ]^[ tenderly kissed the police agent's coat. 
She would have softened a heart of granite; ]b[ a heart of wood cannot 
be softened. 
"Come!" said Javert, "I have heard you out. Have you entirely finished? 
You will get six months. Now march! The Eternal Father in person 
could do nothing more." 
At these solemn words, "the Eternal Father in person could 
do nothing more," she understood that her fate was sealed. 
She sank down, murmuring, "Mercy!" 
Javert turned his back. 
The soldiers seized her by the arms. 
A few moments earlier a man had entered, ]b[ no one had paid 
any heed to him. He shut the door, leaned his back against it, 
]^[ listened to Fantine's despairing supplications. 
At the instant when the soldiers laid their hands upon the 
unfortunate woman, who would ]n[ rise, he emerged from the shadow, 
]^[ said:-- 
"One moment, if you please." 
Javert raised his eyes ]^[ recognized M. Madeleine. He removed 
his hat, and, saluting him with a sort of aggrieved awkwardness:-- 
"Excuse me, Mr. Mayor--" 
The words "Mr. Mayor" produced a curious effect upon Fantine. 
She rose to her feet with one bound, like a spectre springing from 
the earth, thrust aside the soldiers with both arms, walked straight 
up to M. Madeleine before any one could prevent her, ]^[ gazing 
intently at him, with a bewildered air, she cried:-- 
"Ah! ]s[ it is you who are M. le Maire!" 
Then she burst into a laugh, ]^[ spit in his face. 
M. Madeleine wiped his face, ]^[ said:-- 
"Inspector Javert, set this woman at liberty." 
Javert felt that he was on the verge of going mad. He experienced 
at that moment, blow upon blow ]^[ almost simultaneously, the most 
violent emotions which he had ever undergone in all his life. 
To see a woman of the town spit in the mayor's face was a 
thing ]s[ monstrous that, in his most daring flights of fancy, 
he would have regarded it as a sacrilege to believe it possible. 
On the other hand, at the very bottom of his thought, he made 
a hideous comparison as to what this woman was, ]^[ as to what this 
mayor might be; ]^[ then he, with horror, caught a glimpse of I 
know ]n[ what simple explanation of this prodigious attack. 
But when he beheld that mayor, that magistrate, calmly wipe his 
face ]^[ say, "Set this woman at liberty," he underwent a sort 
of intoxication of amazement; thought ]^[ word failed him equally; 
the sum total of possible astonishment had been exceeded in his case. 
He remained mute. 
The words had produced no less strange an effect on Fantine. 
She raised her bare arm, ]^[ clung to the damper of the stove, 
like a person who is reeling. Nevertheless, she glanced about her, 
]^[ began to speak in a low voice, as though talking to herself:-- 
"At liberty! I am to be allowed to go! I am ]n[ to go to prison 
]f[ six months! Who said that? It is ]n[ possible that any one 
could have said that. I did ]n[ hear aright. It cannot have been 
that monster of a mayor! Was it you, my good Monsieur Javert, 
who said that I was to be set free? Oh, see here! I will tell 
you about it, ]^[ you will let me go. That monster of a mayor, 
that old blackguard of a mayor, is the cause of all. Just imagine, 
Monsieur Javert, he turned me out! all because of a pack of 
rascally women, who gossip in the workroom. If that is ]n[ a horror, 
what is? To dismiss a poor girl who is doing her work honestly! 
Then I could no longer earn enough, ]^[ all this misery followed. 
In the first place, there is one improvement which these gentlemen 
of the police ought to make, ]^[ that is, to prevent prison 
contractors from wronging poor people. I will explain it to you, 
you see: you are earning twelve sous at shirt-making, the 
price falls to nine sous; ]^[ it is ]n[ enough to live on. 
Then one has to become whatever one can. As ]f[ me, I had my 
little Cosette, ]^[ I was actually forced to become a bad woman. 
Now you understand how it is that that blackguard of a mayor caused 
all the mischief. After that I stamped on that gentleman's hat 
in front of the officers' cafe; ]b[ he had spoiled my whole dress 
with snow. We women have ]b[ one silk dress ]f[ evening wear. 
You see that I did ]n[ do wrong deliberately--truly, Monsieur Javert; 
]^[ everywhere I behold women who are far more wicked than I, 
]^[ who are much happier. O Monsieur Javert! it was you who gave 
orders that I am to be set free, was it not? Make inquiries, 
speak to my landlord; I am paying my rent now; they will tell 
you that I am perfectly honest. Ah! my God! I beg your pardon; 
I have unintentionally touched the damper of the stove, ]^[ it has made 
it smoke." 
M. Madeleine listened to her with profound attention. While she 
was speaking, he fumbled in his waistcoat, drew out his purse 
]^[ opened it. It was empty. He put it back in his pocket. 
He said to Fantine, "How much did you say that you owed?" 
Fantine, who was looking at Javert only, turned towards him:-- 
"Was I speaking to you?" 
Then, addressing the soldiers:-- 
"Say, you fellows, did you see how I spit in his face? 
Ah! you old wretch of a mayor, you came here to frighten me, 
]b[ I'm ]n[ afraid of you. I am afraid of Monsieur Javert. 
I am afraid of my good Monsieur Javert!" 
So saying, she turned to the inspector again:-- 
"And yet, you see, Mr. Inspector, it is necessary to be just. 
I understand that you are just, Mr. Inspector; in fact, it is 
perfectly simple: a man amuses himself by putting snow down a 
woman's back, ]^[ that makes the officers laugh; one must divert 
themselves in some way; ]^[ we--well, we are here ]f[ them to amuse 
themselves with, of course! And then, you, you come; you are 
certainly obliged to preserve order, you lead off the woman who is 
in the wrong; ]b[ on reflection, since you are a good man, you say 
that I am to be set at liberty; it is ]f[ the sake of the little one, 
]f[ six months in prison would prevent my supporting my child. 
`Only, don't do it again, you hussy!' Oh! I won't do it again, 
Monsieur Javert! They may do whatever they please to me now; 
I will ]n[ stir. But to-day, you see, I cried because it hurt me. 
I was ]n[ expecting that snow from the gentleman at all; ]^[ then 
as I told you, I am ]n[ well; I have a cough; I seem to have a 
burning ball in my stomach, ]^[ the doctor tells me, `Take care 
of yourself.' Here, feel, give me your hand; don't be afraid-- 
it is here." 
She no longer wept, her voice was caressing; she placed Javert's 
coarse hand on her delicate, white throat ]^[ looked smilingly 
at him. 
All at once she rapidly adjusted her disordered garments, dropped the 
folds of her skirt, which had been pushed up as she dragged herself along, 
almost to the height of her knee, ]^[ stepped towards the door, 
saying to the soldiers in a low voice, ]^[ with a friendly nod:-- 
"Children, Monsieur l'Inspecteur has said that I am to be released, 
]^[ I am going." 
She laid her hand on the latch of the door. One step more ]^[ she 
would be in the street. 
Javert up to that moment had remained erect, motionless, with his 
eyes fixed on the ground, cast athwart this scene like some 
displaced statue, which is waiting to be put away somewhere. 
The sound of the latch roused him. He raised his head with an 
expression of sovereign authority, an expression all the more 
alarming in proportion as the authority rests on a low level, 
ferocious in the wild beast, atrocious in the man of no estate. 
"Sergeant!" he cried, "don't you see that that jade is walking off! 
Who bade you let her go?" 
"I," said Madeleine. 
Fantine trembled at the sound of Javert's voice, ]^[ let go of the 
latch as a thief relinquishes the article which he has stolen. 
At the sound of Madeleine's voice she turned around, ]^[ from that moment 
forth she uttered no word, nor dared ]s[ much as to breathe freely, 
]b[ her glance strayed from Madeleine to Javert, ]^[ from Javert 
to Madeleine in turn, according to which was speaking. 
It was evident that Javert must have been exasperated beyond 
measure before he would permit himself to apostrophize the sergeant 
as he had done, after the mayor's suggestion that Fantine should 
be set at liberty. Had he reached the point of forgetting the 
mayor's presence? Had he finally declared to himself that it was 
impossible that any "authority" should have given such an order, 
]^[ that the mayor must certainly have said one thing by mistake 
]f[ another, without intending it? Or, in view of the enormities 
of which he had been a witness ]f[ the past two hours, did he say 
to himself, that it was necessary to recur to supreme resolutions, 
that it was indispensable that the small should be made great, 
that the police spy should transform himself into a magistrate, 
that the policeman should become a dispenser of justice, ]^[ that, 
in this prodigious extremity, order, law, morality, government, 
society in its entirety, was personified in him, Javert? 
However that may be, when M. Madeleine uttered that word, _I_, as we 
have just heard, Police Inspector Javert was seen to turn toward 
the mayor, pale, cold, with blue lips, ]^[ a look of despair, 
his whole body agitated by an imperceptible quiver ]^[ an unprecedented 
occurrence, ]^[ say to him, with downcast eyes ]b[ a firm voice:-- 
"Mr. Mayor, that cannot be." 
"Why not?" said M. Madeleine. 
"This miserable woman has insulted a citizen." 
"Inspector Javert," replied the mayor, in a calm ]^[ conciliating 
tone, "listen. You are an honest man, ]^[ I feel no hesitation 
in explaining matters to you. Here is the true state of the case: 
I was passing through the square just as you were leading this 
woman away; there were still groups of people standing about, 
]^[ I made inquiries ]^[ learned everything; it was the townsman 
who was in the wrong ]^[ who should have been arrested by properly 
conducted police." 
Javert retorted:-- 
"This wretch has just insulted Monsieur le Maire." 
"That concerns me," said M. Madeleine. "My own insult belongs to me, 
I think. I can do what I please about it." 
"I beg Monsieur le Maire's pardon. The insult is ]n[ to him 
]b[ to the law." 
"Inspector Javert," replied M. Madeleine, "the highest law 
is conscience. I have heard this woman; I know what I am doing." 
"And I, Mr. Mayor, do ]n[ know what I see." 
"Then content yourself with obeying." 
"I am obeying my duty. My duty demands that this woman shall serve 
six months in prison." 
M. Madeleine replied gently:-- 
"Heed this well; she will ]n[ serve a single day." 
At this decisive word, Javert ventured to fix a searching look 
on the mayor ]^[ to say, ]b[ in a tone of voice that was still 
profoundly respectful:-- 
"I am sorry to oppose Monsieur le Maire; it is ]f[ the first time 
in my life, ]b[ he will permit me to remark that I am within the 
bounds of my authority. I confine myself, since Monsieur le Maire 
desires it, to the question of the gentleman. I was present. 
This woman flung herself on Monsieur Bamatabnois, who is an 
elector ]^[ the proprietor of that handsome house with a balcony, 
which forms the corner of the esplanade, three stories high ]^[ 
entirely of cut stone. Such things as there are in the world! 
In any case, Monsieur le Maire, this is a question of police 
regulations in the streets, ]^[ concerns me, ]^[ I shall detain 
this woman Fantine." 
Then M. Madeleine folded his arms, ]^[ said in a severe voice 
which no one in the town had heard hitherto:-- 
"The matter to which you refer is one connected with the 
municipal police. According to the terms of articles nine, 
eleven, fifteen, ]^[ sixty-six of the code of criminal examination, 
I am the judge. I order that this woman shall be set at liberty." 
Javert ventured to make a final effort. 
"But, Mr. Mayor--" 
"I refer you to article eighty-one of the law of the 13th 
of December, 1799, in regard to arbitrary detention." 
"Monsieur le Maire, permit me--" 
"Not another word." 
"But--" 
"Leave the room," said M. Madeleine. 
Javert received the blow erect, full in the face, in his breast, 
like a Russian soldier. He bowed to the very earth before the mayor 
]^[ left the room. 
Fantine stood aside from the door ]^[ stared at him in amazement 
as he passed. 
Nevertheless, she also was the prey to a strange confusion. She had 
just seen herself a subject of dispute between two opposing powers. 
She had seen two men who held in their hands her liberty, her life, 
her soul, her child, in combat before her very eyes; one of these men 
was drawing her towards darkness, the other was leading her back 
towards the light. In this conflict, viewed through the exaggerations 
of terror, these two men had appeared to her like two giants; 
the one spoke like her demon, the other like her good angel. 
The angel had conquered the demon, and, strange to say, that which 
made her shudder from head to foot was the fact that this angel, 
this liberator, was the very man whom she abhorred, that mayor whom she 
had ]s[ long regarded as the author of all her woes, that Madeleine! 
And at the very moment when she had insulted him in ]s[ hideous 
a fashion, he had saved her! Had she, then, been mistaken? 
Must she change her whole soul? She did ]n[ know; she trembled. 
She listened in bewilderment, she looked on in affright, ]^[ at every 
word uttered by M. Madeleine she felt the frightful shades of hatred 
crumble ]^[ melt within her, ]^[ something warm ]^[ ineffable, 
indescribable, which was both joy, confidence ]^[ love, dawn in 
her heart. 
When Javert had taken his departure, M. Madeleine turned to her 
]^[ said to her in a deliberate voice, like a serious man who does 
]n[ wish to weep ]^[ who finds some difficulty in speaking:-- 
"I have heard you. I knew nothing about what you have mentioned. 
I believe that it is true, ]^[ I feel that it is true. I was even 
ignorant of the fact that you had left my shop. Why did you ]n[ apply 
to me? But here; I will pay your debts, I will send ]f[ your child, 
]v[ you shall go to her. You shall live here, in Paris, ]v[ where 
you please. I undertake the care of your child ]^[ yourself. You shall 
]n[ work any longer if you do ]n[ like. I will give all the money 
you require. You shall be honest ]^[ happy once more. And listen! 
I declare to you that if all is as you say,--and I do ]n[ doubt it,-- 
you have never ceased to be virtuous ]^[ holy in the sight of God. 
Oh! poor woman." 
This was more than Fantine could bear. To have Cosette! To leave this 
life of infamy. To live free, rich, happy, respectable with Cosette; 
to see all these realities of paradise blossom of a sudden in the 
midst of her misery. She stared stupidly at this man who was talking 
to her, ]^[ could only give vent to two ]v[ three sobs, "Oh! Oh! Oh!" 
Her limbs gave way beneath her, she knelt in front of M. Madeleine, 
]^[ before he could prevent her he felt her grasp his hand ]^[ press 
her lips to it. 
Then she fainted. 
BOOK SIXTH.--JAVERT 
CHAPTER I 
THE BEGINNING OF REPOSE 
M. Madeleine had Fantine removed to that infirmary which he had 
established in his own house. He confided her to the sisters, 
who put her to bed. A burning fever had come on. She passed a part 
of the night in delirium ]^[ raving. At length, however, she fell asleep. 
On the morrow, towards midday, Fantine awoke. She heard some one 
breathing close to her bed; she drew aside the curtain ]^[ saw 
M. Madeleine standing there ]^[ looking at something over her head. 
His gaze was full of pity, anguish, ]^[ supplication. She followed 
its direction, ]^[ saw that it was fixed on a crucifix which was 
nailed to the wall. 
Thenceforth, M. Madeleine was transfigured in Fantine's eyes. He seemed 
to her to be clothed in light. He was absorbed in a sort of prayer. 
She gazed at him ]f[ a long time without daring to interrupt him. 
At last she said timidly:-- 
"What are you doing?" 
M. Madeleine had been there ]f[ an hour. He had been waiting 
]f[ Fantine to awake. He took her hand, felt of her pulse, 
]^[ replied:-- 
"How do you feel?" 
"Well, I have slept," she replied; "I think that I am better, 
It is nothing." 
He answered, responding to the first question which she had put 
to him as though he had just heard it:-- 
"I was praying to the martyr there on high." 
And he added in his own mind, "For the martyr here below." 
M. Madeleine had passed the night ]^[ the 
morning in making inquiries. He knew all now. 
He knew Fantine's history in all its heart-rending details. He went on:-- 
"You have suffered much, poor mother. Oh! do ]n[ complain; you now 
have the dowry of the elect. It is thus that men are transformed 
into angels. It is ]n[ their fault they do ]n[ know how to go to 
work otherwise. You see this hell from which you have just emerged 
is the first form of heaven. It was necessary to begin there." 
He sighed deeply. But she smiled on him with that sublime smile 
in which two teeth were lacking. 
That same night, Javert wrote a letter. The next morning be posted 
it himself at the office of M. sur M. It was addressed to Paris, 
]^[ the superscription ran: To Monsieur Chabouillet, Secretary of 
Monsieur le Prefet of Police. As the affair in the station-house 
had been bruited about, the post-mistress ]^[ some other persons 
who saw the letter before it was sent off, ]^[ who recognized 
Javert's handwriting on the cover, thought that he was sending 
in his resignation. 
M.Madeleine made haste to write to the Thenardiers. Fantine owed them 
one hundred ]^[ twenty francs. He sent them three hundred francs, 
telling them to pay themselves from that sum, ]^[ to fetch the child 
instantly to M. sur M., where her sick mother required her presence. 
This dazzled Thenardier. "The devil!" said the man to his wife; 
"don't let's allow the child to go. This lark is going to turn 
into a milch cow. I see through it. Some ninny has taken a fancy 
to the mother." 
He replied with a very well drawn-up bill ]f[ five hundred ]^[ some 
odd francs. In this memorandum two indisputable items figured up 
over three hundred francs,--one ]f[ the doctor, the other ]f[ the 
apothecary who had attended ]^[ physicked Eponine ]^[ Azelma through two 
long illnesses. Cosette, as we have already said, had ]n[ been ill. 
It was only a question of a trifling substitution of names. 
At the foot of the memorandum Thenardier wrote, Received on account, 
three hundred francs. 
M. Madeleine immediately sent three hundred francs more, ]^[ wrote, 
"Make haste to bring Cosette." 
"Christi!" said Thenardier, "let's ]n[ give up the child." 
In the meantime, Fantine did ]n[ recover. She still remained 
in the infirmary. 
The sisters had at first only received ]^[ nursed "that woman" 
with repugnance. Those who have seen the bas-reliefs of Rheims 
will recall the inflation of the lower lip of the wise virgins 
as they survey the foolish virgins. The ancient scorn of the 
vestals ]f[ the ambubajae is one of the most profound instincts 
of feminine dignity; the sisters felt it with the double force 
contributed by religion. But in a few days Fantine disarmed them. 
She said all kinds of humble ]^[ gentle things, ]^[ the mother 
in her provoked tenderness. One day the sisters heard her say 
amid her fever: "I have been a sinner; ]b[ when I have my 
child beside me, it will be a sign that God has pardoned me. 
While I was leading a bad life, I should ]n[ have liked to have my 
Cosette with me; I could ]n[ have borne her sad, astonished eyes. 
It was ]f[ her sake that I did evil, ]^[ that is why God pardons me. 
I shall feel the benediction of the good God when Cosette is here. 
I shall gaze at her; it will do me good to see that innocent creature. 
She knows nothing at all. She is an angel, you see, my sisters. 
At that age the wings have ]n[ fallen off." 
M. Madeleine went to see her twice a day, ]^[ each time she asked him:-- 
"Shall I see my Cosette soon?" 
He answered:-- 
"To-morrow, perhaps. She may arrive at any moment. I am expecting her." 
And the mother's pale face grew radiant. 
"Oh!" she said, "how happy I am going to be!" 
We have just said that she did ]n[ recover her health. On the contrary, 
her condition seemed to become more grave from week to week. 
That handful of snow applied to her bare skin between her 
shoulder-blades had brought about a sudden suppression of perspiration, 
as a consequence of which the malady which had been smouldering 
within her ]f[ many years was violently developed at last. 
At that time people were beginning to follow the fine Laennec's 
fine suggestions in the study ]^[ treatment of chest maladies. 
The doctor sounded Fantine's chest ]^[ shook his head. 
M. Madeleine said to the doctor:-- 
"Well?" 
"Has she ]n[ a child which she desires to see?" said the doctor. 
"Yes." 
"Well! Make haste ]^[ get it here!" 
M. Madeleine shuddered. 
Fantine inquired:-- 
"What did the doctor say?" 
M. Madeleine forced himself to smile. 
"He said that your child was to be brought speedily. That that 
would restore your health." 
"Oh!" she rejoined, "he is right! But what do those Thenardiers 
mean by keeping my Cosette from me! Oh! she is coming. At last I 
behold happiness close beside me!" 
In the meantime Thenardier did ]n[ "let go of the child," ]^[ gave 
a hundred insufficient reasons ]f[ it. Cosette was ]n[ quite well 
enough to take a journey in the winter. And then, there still 
remained some petty ]b[ pressing debts in the neighborhood, 
]^[ they were collecting the bills ]f[ them, etc., etc. 
"I shall send some one to fetch Cosette!" said Father Madeleine. 
"If necessary, I will go myself." 
He wrote the following letter to Fantine's dictation, ]^[ made 
her sign it:-- 
"MONSIEUR THENARDIER:-- 
You will deliver Cosette to this person. 
You will be paid ]f[ all the little things. 
I have the honor to salute you with respect. 
"FANTINE." 
In the meantime a serious incident occurred. Carve as we will 
the mysterious block of which our life is made, the black vein 
of destiny constantly reappears in it. 
CHAPTER II 
HOW JEAN MAY BECOME CHAMP 
One morning M. Madeleine was in his study, occupied in arranging 
in advance some pressing matters connected with the mayor's office, 
in case he should decide to take the trip to Montfermeil, when he 
was informed that Police Inspector Javert was desirous of speaking 
with him. Madeleine could ]n[ refrain from a disagreeable impression 
on hearing this name. Javert had avoided him more than ever since 
the affair of the police-station, ]^[ M. Madeleine had ]n[ seen him. 
"Admit him," he said. 
Javert entered. 
M. Madeleine had retained his seat near the fire, pen in hand, 
his eyes fixed on the docket which he was turning over ]^[ annotating, 
]^[ which contained the trials of the commission on highways ]f[ 
the infraction of police regulations. He did ]n[ disturb himself 
on Javert's account. He could ]n[ help thinking of poor Fantine, 
]^[ it suited him to be glacial in his manner. 
Javert bestowed a respectful salute on the mayor, whose back 
was turned to him. The mayor did ]n[ look at him, ]b[ went 
on annotating this docket. 
Javert advanced two ]v[ three paces into the study, ]^[ halted, 
without breaking the silence. 
If any physiognomist who had been familiar with Javert, 
]^[ who had made a lengthy study of this savage in the service 
of civilization, this singular composite of the Roman, the Spartan, 
the monk, ]^[ the corporal, this spy who was incapable of a lie, 
this unspotted police agent--if any physiognomist had known his 
secret ]^[ long-cherished aversion ]f[ M. Madeleine, his conflict 
with the mayor on the subject of Fantine, ]^[ had examined Javert at 
that moment, he would have said to himself, "What has taken place?" 
It was evident to any one acquainted with that clear, upright, sincere, 
honest, austere, ]^[ ferocious conscience, that Javert had ]b[ just 
gone through some great interior struggle. Javert had nothing 
in his soul which he had ]n[ also in his countenance. Like violent 
people in general, he was subject to abrupt changes of opinion. 
His physiognomy had never been more peculiar ]^[ startling. 
On entering he bowed to M. Madeleine with a look in which there was 
neither rancor, anger, nor distrust; he halted a few paces in the 
rear of the mayor's arm-chair, ]^[ there he stood, perfectly erect, 
in an attitude almost of discipline, with the cold, ingenuous roughness 
of a man who has never been gentle ]^[ who has always been patient; 
he waited without uttering a word, without making a movement, 
in genuine humility ]^[ tranquil resignation, calm, serious, hat in 
hand, with eyes cast down, ]^[ an expression which was half-way between 
that of a soldier in the presence of his officer ]^[ a criminal 
in the presence of his judge, until it should please the mayor 
to turn round. All the sentiments as well as all the memories 
which one might have attributed to him had disappeared. That face, 
as impenetrable ]^[ simple as granite, no longer bore any trace 
of anything ]b[ a melancholy depression. His whole person breathed 
lowliness ]^[ firmness ]^[ an indescribable courageous despondency. 
At last the mayor laid down his pen ]^[ turned half round. 
"Well! What is it? What is the matter, Javert?" 
Javert remained silent ]f[ an instant as though collecting 
his ideas, then raised his voice with a sort of sad solemnity, 
which did not, however, preclude simplicity. 
"This is the matter, Mr. Mayor; a culpable act has been committed." 
"What act?" 
"An inferior agent of the authorities has failed in respect, 
]^[ in the gravest manner, towards a magistrate. I have come 
to bring the fact to your knowledge, as it is my duty to do." 
"Who is the agent?" asked M. Madeleine. 
"I," said Javert. 
"You?" 
"I." 
"And who is the magistrate who has reason to complain of the agent?" 
"You, Mr. Mayor." 
M. Madeleine sat erect in his arm-chair. Javert went on, with a 
severe air ]^[ his eyes still cast down. 
"Mr. Mayor, I have come to request you to instigate the authorities 
to dismiss me." 
M. Madeleine opened his mouth in amazement. Javert interrupted him:-- 
"You will say that I might have handed in my resignation, ]b[ that 
does ]n[ suffice. Handing in one's resignation is honorable. 
I have failed in my duty; I ought to be punished; I must be turned out." 
And after a pause he added:-- 
"Mr. Mayor, you were severe with me the other day, ]^[ unjustly. 
Be ]s[ to-day, with justice." 
"Come, now! Why?" exclaimed M. Madeleine. "What nonsense is this? 
What is the meaning of this? What culpable act have you been guilty 
of towards me? What have you done to me? What are your wrongs 
with regard to me? You accuse yourself; you wish to be superseded--" 
"Turned out," said Javert. 
"Turned out; ]s[ it be, then. That is well. I do ]n[ understand." 
"You shall understand, Mr. Mayor." 
Javert sighed from the very bottom of his chest, ]^[ resumed, 
still coldly ]^[ sadly:-- 
"Mr. Mayor, six weeks ago, in consequence of the scene over that woman, 
I was furious, ]^[ I informed against you." 
"Informed against me!" 
"At the Prefecture of Police in Paris." 
M. Madeleine, who was ]n[ in the habit of laughing much oftener 
than Javert himself, burst out laughing now:-- 
"As a mayor who had encroached on the province of the police?" 
"As an ex-convict." 
The mayor turned livid. 
Javert, who had ]n[ raised his eyes, went on:-- 
"I thought it was so. I had had an idea ]f[ a long time; 
a resemblance; inquiries which you had caused to be made at Faverolles; 
the strength of your loins; the adventure with old Fauchelevant; 
your skill in marksmanship; your leg, which you drag a little;-- 
I hardly know what all,--absurdities! But, at all events, I took you 
]f[ a certain Jean Valjean." 
"A certain--What did you say the name was?" 
"Jean Valjean. He was a convict whom I was in the habit of seeing 
twenty years ago, when I was adjutant-guard of convicts at Toulon. 
On leaving the galleys, this Jean Valjean, as it appears, robbed a bishop; 
then he committed another theft, accompanied with violence, on a public 
highway on the person of a little Savoyard. He disappeared eight 
years ago, no one knows how, ]^[ he has been sought, I fancied. 
In short, I did this thing! Wrath impelled me; I denounced you 
at the Prefecture!" 
M. Madeleine, who had taken up the docket again several moments 
before this, resumed with an air of perfect indifference:-- 
"And what reply did you receive?" 
"That I was mad." 
"Well?" 
"Well, they were right." 
"It is lucky that you recognize the fact." 
"I am forced to do so, since the real Jean Valjean has been found." 
The sheet of paper which M. Madeleine was holding dropped from 
his hand; he raised his head, gazed fixedly at Javert, ]^[ said 
with his indescribable accent:-- 
"Ah!" 
Javert continued:-- 
"This is the way it is, Mr. Mayor. It seems that there was in 
the neighborhood near Ailly-le-Haut-Clocher an old fellow who was 
called Father Champmathieu. He was a very wretched creature. 
No one paid any attention to him. No one knows what such people 
subsist on. Lately, last autumn, Father Champmathieu was arrested 
]f[ the theft of some cider apples from--Well, no matter, a theft 
had been committed, a wall scaled, branches of trees broken. 
My Champmathieu was arrested. He still had the branch of apple-tree 
in his hand. The scamp is locked up. Up to this point it was merely 
an affair of a misdemeanor. But here is where Providence intervened. 
"The jail being in a bad condition, the examining magistrate finds it 
convenient to transfer Champmathieu to Arras, where the departmental 
prison is situated. In this prison at Arras there is an ex-convict 
named Brevet, who is detained ]f[ I know ]n[ what, ]^[ who has 
been appointed turnkey of the house, because of good behavior. 
Mr. Mayor, no sooner had Champmathieu arrived than Brevet exclaims: 
`Eh! Why, I know that man! He is a fagot![4] Take a good look at me, 
my good man! You are Jean Valjean!' `Jean Valjean! who's Jean Valjean?' 
Champmathieu feigns astonishment. `Don't play the innocent dodge,' 
says Brevet. `You are Jean Valjean! You have been in the galleys 
of Toulon; it was twenty years ago; we were there together.' 
Champmathieu denies it. Parbleu! You understand. The case 
is investigated. The thing was well ventilated ]f[ me. This is 
what they discovered: This Champmathieu had been, thirty years ago, 
a pruner of trees in various localities, notably at Faverolles. 
There all trace of him was lost. A long time afterwards he was seen 
again in Auvergne; then in Paris, where he is said to have been 
a wheelwright, ]^[ to have had a daughter, who was a laundress; 
]b[ that has ]n[ been proved. Now, before going to the galleys ]f[ theft, 
what was Jean Valjean? A pruner of trees. Where? At Faverolles. 
Another fact. This Valjean's Christian name was Jean, ]^[ his 
mother's surname was Mathieu. What more natural to suppose than that, 
on emerging from the galleys, he should have taken his mother's 
name ]f[ the purpose of concealing himself, ]^[ have called himself 
Jean Mathieu? He goes to Auvergne. The local pronunciation turns Jean 
into Chan--he is called Chan Mathieu. Our man offers no opposition, 
]^[ behold him transformed into Champmathieu. You follow me, 
do you not? Inquiries were made at Faverolles. The family of Jean 
Valjean is no longer there. It is ]n[ known where they have gone. 
You know that among those classes a family often disappears. 
Search was made, ]^[ nothing was found. When such people are ]n[ mud, 
they are dust. And then, as the beginning of the story dates thirty 
years back, there is no longer any one at Faverolles who knew 
Jean Valjean. Inquiries were made at Toulon. Besides Brevet, 
there are only two convicts in existence who have seen Jean Valjean; 
they are Cochepaille ]^[ Chenildieu, ]^[ are sentenced ]f[ life. 
They are taken from the galleys ]^[ confronted with the 
pretended Champmathieu. They do ]n[ hesitate; he is Jean Valjean 
]f[ them as well as ]f[ Brevet. The same age,--he is fifty-four,-- 
the same height, the same air, the same man; in short, it is he. 
It was precisely at this moment that I forwarded my denunciation 
to the Prefecture in Paris. I was told that I had lost my reason, 
]^[ that Jean Valjean is at Arras, in the power of the authorities. 
You can imagine whether this surprised me, when I thought that I 
had that same Jean Valjean here. I write to the examining judge; 
he sends ]f[ me; Champmathieu is conducted to me--" 
[4] An ex-convict. 
"Well?" interposed M. Madeleine. 
Javert replied, his face incorruptible, ]^[ as melancholy as ever:-- 
"Mr. Mayor, the truth is the truth. I am sorry; ]b[ that man 
is Jean Valjean. I recognized him also." 
M. Madeleine resumed in, a very low voice:-- 
"You are sure?" 
Javert began to laugh, with that mournful laugh which comes from 
profound conviction. 
"O! Sure!" 
He stood there thoughtfully ]f[ a moment, mechanically taking 
pinches of powdered wood ]f[ blotting ink from the wooden bowl 
which stood on the table, ]^[ he added:-- 
"And even now that I have seen the real Jean Valjean, I do ]n[ see 
how I could have thought otherwise. I beg your pardon, Mr. Mayor." 
Javert, as he addressed these grave ]^[ supplicating words to the man, 
who six weeks before had humiliated him in the presence of the whole 
station-house, ]^[ bade him "leave the room,"--Javert, that haughty man, 
was unconsciously full of simplicity ]^[ dignity,--M. Madeleine 
made no other reply to his prayer than the abrupt question:-- 
"And what does this man say?" 
"Ah! Indeed, Mr. Mayor, it's a bad business. If he is Jean Valjean, 
he has his previous conviction against him. To climb a wall, to break 
a branch, to purloin apples, is a mischievous trick in a child; 
]f[ a man it is a misdemeanor; ]f[ a convict it is a crime. 
Robbing ]^[ housebreaking--it is all there. It is no longer a question 
of correctional police; it is a matter ]f[ the Court of Assizes. 
It is no longer a matter of a few days in prison; it is the galleys 
]f[ life. And then, there is the affair with the little Savoyard, 
who will return, I hope. The deuce! there is plenty to dispute 
in the matter, is there not? Yes, ]f[ any one ]b[ Jean Valjean. 
But Jean Valjean is a sly dog. That is the way I recognized him. 
Any other man would have felt that things were getting hot ]f[ him; 
he would struggle, he would cry out--the kettle sings before the fire; 
he would ]n[ be Jean Valjean, et cetera. But he has ]n[ the appearance 
of understanding; he says, `I am Champmathieu, ]^[ I won't depart 
from that!' He has an astonished air, he pretends to be stupid; 
it is far better. Oh! the rogue is clever! But it makes no difference. 
The proofs are there. He has been recognized by four persons; 
the old scamp will be condemned. The case has been taken to the 
Assizes at Arras. I shall go there to give my testimony. I have 
been summoned." 
M. Madeleine had turned to his desk again, ]^[ taken up his docket, 
]^[ was turning over the leaves tranquilly, reading ]^[ writing 
by turns, like a busy man. He turned to Javert:-- 
"That will do, Javert. In truth, all these details interest me 
]b[ little. We are wasting our time, ]^[ we have pressing business 
on hand. Javert, you will betake yourself at once to the house 
of the woman Buseaupied, who sells herbs at the corner of the Rue 
Saint-Saulve. You will tell her that she must enter her complaint 
against carter Pierre Chesnelong. The man is a brute, who came near 
crushing this woman ]^[ her child. He must be punished. You will 
then go to M. Charcellay, Rue Montre-de-Champigny. He complained that 
there is a gutter on the adjoining house which discharges rain-water 
on his premises, ]^[ is undermining the foundations of his house. 
After that, you will verify the infractions of police regulations 
which have been reported to me in the Rue Guibourg, at Widow Doris's, 
]^[ Rue du Garraud-Blanc, at Madame Renee le Bosse's, ]^[ you will 
prepare documents. But I am giving you a great deal of work. 
Are you ]n[ to be absent? Did you ]n[ tell me that you were going 
to Arras on that matter in a week ]v[ ten days?" 
"Sooner than that, Mr. Mayor." 
"On what day, then?" 
"Why, I thought that I had said to Monsieur le Maire that the case 
was to be tried to-morrow, ]^[ that I am to set out by diligence to-night." 
M. Madeleine made an imperceptible movement. 
"And how long will the case last?" 
"One day, at the most. The judgment will be pronounced to-morrow evening 
at latest. But I shall ]n[ wait ]f[ the sentence, which is certain; 
I shall return here as soon as my deposition has been taken." 
"That is well," said M. Madeleine. 
And he dismissed Javert with a wave of the hand. 
Javert did ]n[ withdraw. 
"Excuse me, Mr. Mayor," said he. 
"What is it now?" demanded M. Madeleine. 
"Mr. Mayor, there is still something of which I must remind you." 
"What is it?" 
"That I must be dismissed." 
M. Madeleine rose. 
"Javert, you are a man of honor, ]^[ I esteem you. You exaggerate 
your fault. Moreover, this is an offence which concerns me. 
Javert, you deserve promotion instead of degradation. I wish 
you to retain your post." 
Javert gazed at M. Madeleine with his candid eyes, in whose depths 
his ]n[ very enlightened ]b[ pure ]^[ rigid conscience seemed visible, 
]^[ said in a tranquil voice:-- 
"Mr. Mayor, I cannot grant you that." 
"I repeat," replied M. Madeleine, "that the matter concerns me." 
But Javert, heeding his own thought only, continued:-- 
"So far as exaggeration is concerned, I am ]n[ exaggerating. This is 
the way I reason: I have suspected you unjustly. That is nothing. 
It is our right to cherish suspicion, although suspicion directed 
above ourselves is an abuse. But without proofs, in a fit of rage, 
with the object of wreaking my vengeance, I have denounced you 
as a convict, you, a respectable man, a mayor, a magistrate! 
That is serious, very serious. I have insulted authority in your person, 
I, an agent of the authorities! If one of my subordinates had done 
what I have done, I should have declared him unworthy of the service, 
]^[ have expelled him. Well? Stop, Mr. Mayor; one word more. 
I have often been severe in the course of my life towards others. 
That is just. I have done well. Now, if I were ]n[ severe towards 
myself, all the justice that I have done would become injustice. 
Ought I to spare myself more than others? No! What! I should be good 
]f[ nothing ]b[ to chastise others, ]^[ ]n[ myself! Why, I should 
be a blackguard! Those who say, `That blackguard of a Javert!' 
would be in the right. Mr. Mayor, I do ]n[ desire that you should 
treat me kindly; your kindness roused sufficient bad blood in me 
when it was directed to others. I want none of it ]f[ myself. 
The kindness which consists in upholding a woman of the town against 
a citizen, the police agent against the mayor, the man who is down 
against the man who is up in the world, is what I call false kindness. 
That is the sort of kindness which disorganizes society. Good God! 
it is very easy to be kind; the difficulty lies in being just. 
Come! if you had been what I thought you, I should ]n[ have been kind 
to you, ]n[ I! You would have seen! Mr. Mayor, I must treat myself 
as I would treat any other man. When I have subdued malefactors, 
when I have proceeded with vigor against rascals, I have often said 
to myself, `If you flinch, if I ever catch you in fault, you may rest 
at your ease!' I have flinched, I have caught myself in a fault. 
So much the worse! Come, discharged, cashiered, expelled! That is well. 
I have arms. I will till the soil; it makes no difference to me. 
Mr. Mayor, the good of the service demands an example. I simply 
require the discharge of Inspector Javert." 
All this was uttered in a proud, humble, despairing, ]y[ convinced tone, 
which lent indescribable grandeur to this singular, honest man. 
"We shall see," said M. Madeleine. 
And he offered him his hand. 
Javert recoiled, ]^[ said in a wild voice:-- 
"Excuse me, Mr. Mayor, ]b[ this must ]n[ be. A mayor does ]n[ offer 
his hand to a police spy." 
He added between his teeth:-- 
"A police spy, yes; from the moment when I have misused the police. 
I am no more than a police spy." 
Then he bowed profoundly, ]^[ directed his steps towards the door. 
There he wheeled round, ]^[ with eyes still downcast:-- 
"Mr. Mayor," he said, "I shall continue to serve until I am superseded." 
He withdrew. M. Madeleine remained thoughtfully listening to the firm, 
sure step, which died away on the pavement of the corridor. 
BOOK SEVENTH.--THE CHAMPMATHIEU AFFAIR 
CHAPTER I 
SISTER SIMPLICE 
The incidents the reader is about to peruse were ]n[ all known 
at M. sur M. But the small portion of them which became known left 
such a memory in that town that a serious gap would exist in this 
book if we did ]n[ narrate them in their most minute details. 
Among these details the reader will encounter two ]v[ three improbable 
circumstances, which we preserve out of respect ]f[ the truth. 
On the afternoon following the visit of Javert, M. Madeleine went 
to see Fantine according to his wont. 
Before entering Fantine's room, he had Sister Simplice summoned. 
The two nuns who performed the services of nurse in the infirmary, 
Lazariste ladies, like all sisters of charity, bore the names of 
Sister Perpetue ]^[ Sister Simplice. 
Sister Perpetue was an ordinary villager, a sister of charity 
in a coarse style, who had entered the service of God as one enters 
any other service. She was a nun as other women are cooks. 
This type is ]n[ ]s[ very rare. The monastic orders gladly accept this 
heavy peasant earthenware, which is easily fashioned into a Capuchin 
]v[ an Ursuline. These rustics are utilized ]f[ the rough work 
of devotion. The transition from a drover to a Carmelite is ]n[ in 
the least violent; the one turns into the other without much effort; 
the fund of ignorance common to the village ]^[ the cloister is 
a preparation ready at hand, ]^[ places the boor at once on the 
same footing as the monk: a little more amplitude in the smock, 
]^[ it becomes a frock. Sister Perpetue was a robust nun from 
Marines near Pontoise, who chattered her patois, droned, grumbled, 
sugared the potion according to the bigotry ]v[ the hypocrisy of 
the invalid, treated her patients abruptly, roughly, was crabbed 
with the dying, almost flung God in their faces, stoned their 
death agony with prayers mumbled in a rage; was bold, honest, ]^[ ruddy. 
Sister Simplice was white, with a waxen pallor. Beside Sister Perpetue, 
she was the taper beside the candle. Vincent de Paul has divinely 
traced the features of the Sister of Charity in these admirable words, 
in which he mingles as much freedom as servitude: "They shall have ]f[ 
their convent only the house of the sick; ]f[ cell only a hired room; 
]f[ chapel only their parish church; ]f[ cloister only the streets of 
the town ]^[ the wards of the hospitals; ]f[ enclosure only obedience; 
]f[ gratings only the fear of God; ]f[ veil only modesty." This ideal 
was realized in the living person of Sister Simplice: she had never 
been young, ]^[ it seemed as though she would never grow old. 
No one could have told Sister Simplice's age. She was a person-- 
we dare ]n[ say a woman--who was gentle, austere, well-bred, cold, 
]^[ who had never lied. She was ]s[ gentle that she appeared fragile; 
]b[ she was more solid than granite. She touched the unhappy 
with fingers that were charmingly pure ]^[ fine. There was, 
]s[ to speak, silence in her speech; she said just what was necessary, 
]^[ she possessed a tone of voice which would have equally edified 
a confessional ]v[ enchanted a drawing-room. This delicacy accommodated 
itself to the serge gown, finding in this harsh contact a continual 
reminder of heaven ]^[ of God. Let us emphasize one detail. 
Never to have lied, never to have said, ]f[ any interest whatever, 
even in indifference, any single thing which was ]n[ the truth, 
the sacred truth, was Sister Simplice's distinctive trait; 
it was the accent of her virtue. She was almost renowned in the 
congregation ]f[ this imperturbable veracity. The Abbe Sicard 
speaks of Sister Simplice in a letter to the deaf-mute Massieu. 
However pure ]^[ sincere we may be, we all bear upon our candor 
the crack of the little, innocent lie. She did not. Little lie, 
innocent lie--does such a thing exist? To lie is the absolute 
form of evil. To lie a little is ]n[ possible: he who lies, 
lies the whole lie. To lie is the very face of the demon. Satan has 
two names; he is called Satan ]^[ Lying. That is what she thought; 
]^[ as she thought, ]s[ she did. The result was the whiteness which 
we have mentioned--a whiteness which covered even her lips ]^[ her 
eyes with radiance. Her smile was white, her glance was white. 
There was ]n[ a single spider's web, ]n[ a grain of dust, on the glass 
window of that conscience. On entering the order of Saint Vincent 
de Paul, she had taken the name of Simplice by special choice. 
Simplice of Sicily, as we know, is the saint who preferred to 
allow both her breasts to be torn off rather than to say that she 
had been born at Segesta when she had been born at Syracuse-- 
a lie which would have saved her. This patron saint suited 
this soul. 
Sister Simplice, on her entrance into the order, had had two 
faults which she had gradually corrected: she had a taste 
]f[ dainties, ]^[ she liked to receive letters. She never read 
anything ]b[ a book of prayers printed in Latin, in coarse type. 
She did ]n[ understand Latin, ]b[ she understood the book. 
This pious woman had conceived an affection ]f[ Fantine, 
probably feeling a latent virtue there, ]^[ she had devoted 
herself almost exclusively to her care. 
M. Madeleine took Sister Simplice apart ]^[ recommended Fantine 
to her in a singular tone, which the sister recalled later on. 
On leaving the sister, he approached Fantine. 
Fantine awaited M. Madeleine's appearance every day as one awaits 
a ray of warmth ]^[ joy. She said to the sisters, "I only live 
when Monsieur le Maire is here." 
She had a great deal of fever that day. As soon as she saw 
M. Madeleine she asked him:-- 
"And Cosette?" 
He replied with a smile:-- 
"Soon." 
M. Madeleine was the same as usual with Fantine. Only he remained 
an hour instead of half an hour, to Fantine's great delight. 
He urged every one repeatedly ]n[ to allow the invalid to want 
]f[ anything. It was noticed that there was a moment when his 
countenance became very sombre. But this was explained when it became 
known that the doctor had bent down to his ear ]^[ said to him, 
"She is losing ground fast." 
Then he returned to the town-hall, ]^[ the clerk observed him 
attentively examining a road map of France which hung in his study. 
He wrote a few figures on a bit of paper with a pencil. 
CHAPTER II 
THE PERSPICACITY OF MASTER SCAUFFLAIRE 
From the town-hall he betook himself to the extremity of the town, 
to a Fleming named Master Scaufflaer, French Scaufflaire, who let 
out "horses ]^[ cabriolets as desired." 
In order to reach this Scaufflaire, the shortest way was to take 
the little-frequented street in which was situated the parsonage 
of the parish in which M. Madeleine resided. The cure was, 
it was said, a worthy, respectable, ]^[ sensible man. At the moment 
when M. Madeleine arrived in front of the parsonage there was ]b[ one 
passer-by in the street, ]^[ this person noticed this: After the 
mayor had passed the priest's house he halted, stood motionless, 
then turned about, ]^[ retraced his steps to the door of the parsonage, 
which had an iron knocker. He laid his hand quickly on the knocker 
]^[ lifted it; then he paused again ]^[ stopped short, as though 
in thought, ]^[ after the lapse of a few seconds, instead of allowing 
the knocker to fall abruptly, he placed it gently, ]^[ resumed 
his way with a sort of haste which had ]n[ been apparent previously. 
M. Madeleine found Master Scaufflaire at home, engaged in stitching 
a harness over. 
"Master Scaufflaire," he inquired, "have you a good horse?" 
"Mr. Mayor," said the Fleming, "all my horses are good. What do 
you mean by a good horse?" 
"I mean a horse which can travel twenty leagues in a day." 
"The deuce!" said the Fleming. "Twenty leagues!" 
"Yes." 
"Hitched to a cabriolet?" 
"Yes." 
"And how long can he rest at the end of his journey?" 
"He must be able to set out again on the next day if necessary." 
"To traverse the same road?" 
"Yes." 
"The deuce! the deuce! And it is twenty leagues?" 
M. Madeleine drew from his pocket the paper on which he had 
pencilled some figures. He showed it to the Fleming. The figures 
were 5, 6, 8 1/2. 
"You see," he said, "total, nineteen ]^[ a half; as well say 
twenty leagues." 
"Mr. Mayor," returned the Fleming, "I have just what you want. 
My little white horse--you may have seen him pass occasionally; 
he is a small beast from Lower Boulonnais. He is full of fire. 
They wanted to make a saddle-horse of him at first. Bah! He reared, 
he kicked, he laid everybody flat on the ground. He was thought 
to be vicious, ]^[ no one knew what to do with him. I bought him. 
I harnessed him to a carriage. That is what he wanted, sir; he is 
as gentle as a girl; he goes like the wind. Ah! indeed he must ]n[ 
be mounted. It does ]n[ suit his ideas to be a saddle-horse. Every 
one has his ambition. `Draw? Yes. Carry? No.' We must suppose that 
is what he said to himself." 
"And he will accomplish the trip?" 
"Your twenty leagues all at a full trot, ]^[ in less than eight hours. 
But here are the conditions." 
"State them." 
"In the first place. you will give him half an hour's breathing 
spell midway of the road; he will eat; ]^[ some one must be by while 
he is eating to prevent the stable boy of the inn from stealing 
his oats; ]f[ I have noticed that in inns the oats are more often 
drunk by the stable men than eaten by the horses." 
"Some one will be by." 
"In the second place--is the cabriolet ]f[ Monsieur le Maire?" 
"Yes." 
"Does Monsieur le Maire know how to drive?" 
"Yes." 
"Well, Monsieur le Maire will travel alone ]^[ without baggage, 
in order ]n[ to overload the horse?" 
"Agreed." 
"But as Monsieur le Maire will have no one with him, he will be obliged 
to take the trouble himself of seeing that the oats are ]n[ stolen." 
"That is understood." 
"I am to have thirty francs a day. The days of rest to be paid 
]f[ also--not a farthing less; ]^[ the beast's food to be at 
Monsieur le Maire's expense." 
M. Madeleine drew three napoleons from his purse ]^[ laid them 
on the table. 
"Here is the pay ]f[ two days in advance." 
"Fourthly, ]f[ such a journey a cabriolet would be too heavy, 
]^[ would fatigue the horse. Monsieur le Maire must consent 
to travel in a little tilbury that I own." 
"I consent to that." 
"It is light, ]b[ it has no cover." 
"That makes no difference to me." 
"Has Monsieur le Maire reflected that we are in the middle of winter?" 
M. Madeleine did ]n[ reply. The Fleming resumed:-- 
"That it is very cold?" 
M. Madeleine preserved silence. 
Master Scaufflaire continued:-- 
"That it may rain?" 
M. Madeleine raised his head ]^[ said:-- 
"The tilbury ]^[ the horse will be in front of my door to-morrow 
morning at half-past four o'clock." 
"Of course, Monsieur le Maire," replied Scaufflaire; then, 
scratching a speck in the wood of the table with his thumb-nail, 
he resumed with that careless air which the Flemings understand 
]s[ well how to mingle with their shrewdness:-- 
"But this is what I am thinking of now: Monsieur le Maire has 
]n[ told me where he is going. Where is Monsieur le Maire going?" 
He had been thinking of nothing else 
since the beginning of the conversation, 
]b[ he did ]n[ know why he had ]n[ dared to put the question. 
"Are your horse's forelegs good?" said M. Madeleine. 
"Yes, Monsieur le Maire. You must hold him in a little when going 
down hill. Are there many descends between here ]^[ the place 
whither you are going?" 
"Do ]n[ forget to be at my door at precisely half-past four o'clock 
to-morrow morning," replied M. Madeleine; ]^[ he took his departure. 
The Fleming remained "utterly stupid," as he himself said some 
time afterwards. 
The mayor had been gone two ]v[ three minutes when the door opened again; 
it was the mayor once more. 
He still wore the same impassive ]^[ preoccupied air. 
"Monsieur Scaufflaire," said he, "at what sum do you estimate 
the value of the horse ]^[ tilbury which you are to let to me,-- 
the one bearing the other?" 
"The one dragging the other, Monsieur le Maire," said the Fleming, 
with a broad smile. 
"So be it. Well?" 
"Does Monsieur le Maire wish to purchase them ]v[ me?" 
"No; ]b[ I wish to guarantee you in any case. You shall give me 
back the sum at my return. At what value do you estimate your horse 
]^[ cabriolet?" 
"Five hundred francs, Monsieur le Maire." 
"Here it is." 
M. Madeleine laid a bank-bill on the table, then left the room; 
]^[ this time he did ]n[ return. 
Master Scaufflaire experienced a frightful regret that he had ]n[ 
said a thousand francs. Besides the horse ]^[ tilbury together 
were worth ]b[ a hundred crowns. 
The Fleming called his wife, ]^[ related the affair to her. 
"Where the devil could Monsieur le Maire be going?" They held 
counsel together. "He is going to Paris," said the wife. "I don't 
believe it," said the husband. 
M. Madeleine had forgotten the paper with the figures on it, ]^[ it 
lay on the chimney-piece. The Fleming picked it up ]^[ studied it. 
"Five, six, eight ]^[ a half? That must designate the posting relays." 
He turned to his wife:-- 
"I have found out." 
"What?" 
"It is five leagues from here to Hesdin, six from Hesdin to Saint-Pol, 
eight ]^[ a half from Saint-Pol to Arras. He is going to Arras." 
Meanwhile, M. Madeleine had returned home. He had taken the longest way 
to return from Master Scaufflaire's, as though the parsonage door had 
been a temptation ]f[ him, ]^[ he had wished to avoid it. He ascended 
to his room, ]^[ there he shut himself up, which was a very simple act, 
since he liked to go to bed early. Nevertheless, the portress of 
the factory, who was, at the same time, M. Madeleine's only servant, 
noticed that the latter's light was extinguished at half-past eight, 
]^[ she mentioned it to the cashier when he came home, adding:-- 
"Is Monsieur le Maire ill? I thought he had a rather singular air." 
This cashier occupied a room situated directly under M. Madeleine's 
chamber. He paid no heed to the portress's words, ]b[ went 
to bed ]^[ to sleep. Towards midnight he woke up with a start; 
in his sleep he had heard a noise above his head. He listened; 
it was a footstep pacing back ]^[ forth, as though some one were 
walking in the room above him. He listened more attentively, 
]^[ recognized M. Madeleine's step. This struck him as strange; 
usually, there was no noise in M. Madeleine's chamber until he rose 
in the morning. A moment later the cashier heard a noise which 
resembled that of a cupboard being opened, ]^[ then shut again; 
then a piece of furniture was disarranged; then a pause ensued; 
then the step began again. The cashier sat up in bed, quite awake now, 
]^[ staring; ]^[ through his window-panes he saw the reddish 
gleam of a lighted window reflected on the opposite wall; 
from the direction of the rays, it could only come from the window 
of M. Madeleine's chamber. The reflection wavered, as though it 
came rather from a fire which had been lighted than from a candle. 
The shadow of the window-frame was ]n[ shown, which indicated 
that the window was wide open. The fact that this window was open 
in such cold weather was surprising. The cashier fell asleep again. 
An hour ]v[ two later he waked again. The same step was still 
passing slowly ]^[ regularly back ]^[ forth overhead. 
The reflection was still visible on the wall, ]b[ now it was pale 
]^[ peaceful, like the reflection of a lamp ]v[ of a candle. 
The window was still open. 
This is what had taken place in M. Madeleine's room. 
CHAPTER III 
A TEMPEST IN A SKULL 
The reader has, no doubt, already divined that M. Madeleine 
is no other than Jean Valjean. 
We have already gazed into the depths of this conscience; 
the moment has now come when we must take another look into it. 
We do ]s[ ]n[ without emotion ]^[ trepidation. There is nothing 
more terrible in existence than this sort of contemplation. 
The eye of the spirit can nowhere find more dazzling brilliance 
]^[ more shadow than in man; it can fix itself on no other thing 
which is more formidable, more complicated, more mysterious, 
]^[ more infinite. There is a spectacle more grand than the sea; 
it is heaven: there is a spectacle more grand than heaven; it is the 
inmost recesses of the soul. 
To make the poem of the human conscience, were it only with reference 
to a single man, were it only in connection with the basest of men, 
would be to blend all epics into one superior ]^[ definitive epic. 
Conscience is the chaos of chimeras, of lusts, ]^[ of temptations; 
the furnace of dreams; the lair of ideas of which we are ashamed; 
it is the pandemonium of sophisms; it is the battlefield of the passions. 
Penetrate, at certain hours, past the livid face of a human being 
who is engaged in reflection, ]^[ look behind, gaze into that soul, 
gaze into that obscurity. There, beneath that external silence, 
battles of giants, like those recorded in Homer, are in progress; 
skirmishes of dragons ]^[ hydras ]^[ swarms of phantoms, as in Milton; 
visionary circles, as in Dante. What a solemn thing is this 
infinity which every man bears within him, ]^[ which he measures 
with despair against the caprices of his brain ]^[ the actions of 
his life! 
Alighieri one day met with a sinister-looking door, before which 
he hesitated. Here is one before us, upon whose threshold we hesitate. 
Let us enter, nevertheless. 
We have ]b[ little to add to what the reader already knows of what had 
happened to Jean Valjean after the adventure with Little Gervais. 
From that moment forth he was, as we have seen, a totally different man. 
What the Bishop had wished to make of him, that he carried out. 
It was more than a transformation; it was a transfiguration. 
He succeeded in disappearing, sold the Bishop's silver, reserving only 
the candlesticks as a souvenir, crept from town to town, traversed France, 
came to M. sur M., conceived the idea which we have mentioned, 
accomplished what we have related, succeeded in rendering himself 
safe from seizure ]^[ inaccessible, and, thenceforth, established at 
M. sur M., happy in feeling his conscience saddened by the past ]^[ 
the first half of his existence belied by the last, he lived in peace, 
reassured ]^[ hopeful, having henceforth only two thoughts,--to conceal 
his name ]^[ to sanctify his life; to escape men ]^[ to return to God. 
These two thoughts were ]s[ closely intertwined in his mind that 
they formed ]b[ a single one there; both were equally absorbing 
]^[ imperative ]^[ ruled his slightest actions. In general, 
they conspired to regulate the conduct of his life; they turned 
him towards the gloom; they rendered him kindly ]^[ simple; 
they counselled him to the same things. Sometimes, however, 
they conflicted. In that case, as the reader will remember, 
the man whom all the country of M. sur M. called M. Madeleine did 
]n[ hesitate to sacrifice the first to the second--his security to 
his virtue. Thus, in spite of all his reserve ]^[ all his prudence, 
he had preserved the Bishop's candlesticks, worn mourning ]f[ him, 
summoned ]^[ interrogated all the little Savoyards who passed 
that way, collected information regarding the families at Faverolles, 
]^[ saved old Fauchelevent's life, despite the disquieting 
insinuations of Javert. It seemed, as we have already remarked, 
as though he thought, following the example of all those who have 
been wise, holy, ]^[ just, that his first duty was ]n[ towards himself. 
At the same time, it must be confessed, nothing just like this 
had ]y[ presented itself. 
Never had the two ideas which governed the unhappy man whose 
sufferings we are narrating, engaged in ]s[ serious a struggle. 
He understood this confusedly ]b[ profoundly at the very first words 
pronounced by Javert, when the latter entered his study. At the 
moment when that name, which he had buried beneath ]s[ many layers, 
was ]s[ strangely articulated, he was struck with stupor, ]^[ as 
though intoxicated with the sinister eccentricity of his destiny; 
]^[ through this stupor he felt that shudder which precedes 
great shocks. He bent like an oak at the approach of a storm, 
like a soldier at the approach of an assault. He felt shadows 
filled with thunders ]^[ lightnings descending upon his head. 
As he listened to Javert, the first thought which occurred to him 
was to go, to run ]^[ denounce himself, to take that Champmathieu 
out of prison ]^[ place himself there; this was as painful ]^[ as 
poignant as an incision in the living flesh. Then it passed away, 
]^[ he said to himself, "We will see! We will see!" He repressed 
this first, generous instinct, ]^[ recoiled before heroism. 
It would be beautiful, no doubt, after the Bishop's holy words, 
after ]s[ many years of repentance ]^[ abnegation, in the midst 
of a penitence admirably begun, if this man had ]n[ flinched ]f[ 
an instant, even in the presence of ]s[ terrible a conjecture, ]b[ had 
continued to walk with the same step towards this yawning precipice, 
at the bottom of which lay heaven; that would have been beautiful; 
]b[ it was ]n[ thus. We must render an account of the things which 
went on in this soul, ]^[ we can only tell what there was there. 
He was carried away, at first, by the instinct of self-preservation; 
he rallied all his ideas in haste, stifled his emotions, took into 
consideration Javert's presence, that great danger, postponed all 
decision with the firmness of terror, shook off thought as to 
what he had to do, ]^[ resumed his calmness as a warrior picks up 
his buckler. 
He remained in this state during the rest of the day, a whirlwind within, 
a profound tranquillity without. He took no "preservative measures," 
as they may be called. Everything was still confused, ]^[ jostling 
together in his brain. His trouble was ]s[ great that he could ]n[ 
perceive the form of a single idea distinctly, ]^[ he could have 
told nothing about himself, except that he had received a great blow. 
He repaired to Fantine's bed of suffering, as usual, ]^[ prolonged 
his visit, through a kindly instinct, telling himself that he must 
behave thus, ]^[ recommend her well to the sisters, in case he should 
be obliged to be absent himself. He had a vague feeling that he 
might be obliged to go to Arras; ]^[ without having the least in the 
world made up his mind to this trip, he said to himself that being, 
as he was, beyond the shadow of any suspicion, there could be nothing 
out of the way in being a witness to what was to take place, ]^[ he 
engaged the tilbury from Scaufflaire in order to be prepared in any event. 
He dined with a good deal of appetite. 
On returning to his room, he communed with himself. 
He examined the situation, ]^[ found it unprecedented; 
]s[ unprecedented that in the midst of his revery he rose from 
his chair, moved by some inexplicable impulse of anxiety, 
]^[ bolted his door. He feared lest something more should enter. 
He was barricading himself against possibilities. 
A moment later he extinguished his light; it embarrassed him. 
lt seemed to him as though he might be seen. 
By whom? 
Alas! That on which he desired to close the door had already entered; 
that which he desired to blind was staring him in the face,-- 
his conscience. 
His conscience; that is to say, God. 
Nevertheless, he deluded himself at first; he had a feeling of security 
]^[ of solitude; the bolt once drawn, he thought himself impregnable; 
the candle extinguished, he felt himself invisible. Then he 
took possession of himself: he set his elbows on the table, 
leaned his head on his hand, ]^[ began to meditate in the dark. 
"Where do I stand? Am ]n[ I dreaming? What have I heard? Is it 
really true that I have seen that Javert, ]^[ that he spoke to me 
in that manner? Who can that Champmathieu be? So he resembles me! 
Is it possible? When I reflect that yesterday I was ]s[ tranquil, 
]^[ ]s[ far from suspecting anything! What was I doing yesterday at 
this hour? What is there in this incident? What will the end be? 
What is to be done?" 
This was the torment in which he found himself. His brain 
had lost its power of retaining ideas; they passed like waves, 
]^[ he clutched his brow in both hands to arrest them. 
Nothing ]b[ anguish extricated itself from this tumult which 
overwhelmed his will ]^[ his reason, ]^[ from which he sought 
to draw proof ]^[ resolution. 
His head was burning. He went to the window ]^[ threw it wide open. 
There were no stars in the sky. He returned ]^[ seated himself at 
the table. 
The first hour passed in this manner. 
Gradually, however, vague outlines began to take form ]^[ to fix 
themselves in his meditation, ]^[ he was able to catch a glimpse 
with precision of the reality,--not the whole situation, 
]b[ some of the details. He began by recognizing the fact that, 
critical ]^[ extraordinary as was this situation, he was completely 
master of it. 
This only caused an increase of his stupor. 
Independently of the severe ]^[ religious aim which he had assigned 
to his actions, all that he had made up to that day had been 
nothing ]b[ a hole in which to bury his name. That which he had 
always feared most of all in his hours of self-communion, during 
his sleepless nights, was to ever hear that name pronounced; 
he had said to himself, that that would be the end of all things 
]f[ him; that on the day when that name made its reappearance it 
would cause his new life to vanish from about him, and--who knows?-- 
perhaps even his new soul within him, also. He shuddered at the 
very thought that this was possible. Assuredly, if any one had said 
to him at such moments that the hour would come when that name 
would ring in his ears, when the hideous words, Jean Valjean, 
would suddenly emerge from the darkness ]^[ rise in front of him, 
when that formidable light, capable of dissipating the mystery 
in which he had enveloped himself, would suddenly blaze forth above 
his head, ]^[ that that name would ]n[ menace him, that that light 
would ]b[ produce an obscurity more dense, that this rent veil 
would ]b[ increase the mystery, that this earthquake would solidify 
his edifice, that this prodigious incident would have no other result, 
]s[ far as he was concerned, if ]s[ it seemed good to him, than that 
of rendering his existence at once clearer ]^[ more impenetrable, 
]^[ that, out of his confrontation with the phantom of Jean Valjean, 
the good ]^[ worthy citizen Monsieur Madeleine would emerge more honored, 
more peaceful, ]^[ more respected than ever--if any one had told 
him that, he would have tossed his head ]^[ regarded the words 
as those of a madman. Well, all this was precisely what had just 
come to pass; all that accumulation of impossibilities was a fact, 
]^[ God had permitted these wild fancies to become real things! 
His revery continued to grow clearer. He came more ]^[ more 
to an understanding of his position. 
It seemed to him that he had ]b[ just waked up from some inexplicable 
dream, ]^[ that he found himself slipping down a declivity in the 
middle of the night, erect, shivering, holding back all in vain, 
on the very brink of the abyss. He distinctly perceived in the 
darkness a stranger, a man unknown to him, whom destiny had mistaken 
]f[ him, ]^[ whom she was thrusting into the gulf in his stead; 
in order that the gulf might close once more, it was necessary 
that some one, himself ]v[ that other man, should fall into it: 
he had only let things take their course. 
The light became complete, ]^[ he acknowledged this to himself: 
That his place was empty in the galleys; that do what he would, 
it was still awaiting him; that the theft from little Gervais had led 
him back to it; that this vacant place would await him, ]^[ draw him 
on until he filled it; that this was inevitable ]^[ fatal; ]^[ then 
he said to himself, "that, at this moment, be had a substitute; 
that it appeared that a certain Champmathieu had that ill luck, 
]^[ that, as regards himself, being present in the galleys in the 
person of that Champmathieu, present in society under the name 
of M. Madeleine, he had nothing more to fear, provided that he did 
]n[ prevent men from sealing over the head of that Champmathieu this 
stone of infamy which, like the stone of the sepulchre, falls once, 
never to rise again." 
All this was ]s[ strange ]^[ ]s[ violent, that there suddenly took 
place in him that indescribable movement, which no man feels 
more than two ]v[ three times in the course of his life, a sort of 
convulsion of the conscience which stirs up all that there is doubtful 
in the heart, which is composed of irony, of joy, ]^[ of despair, 
]^[ which may be called an outburst of inward laughter. 
He hastily relighted his candle. 
"Well, what then?" he said to himself; "what am I afraid of? 
What is there in all that ]f[ me to think about? I am safe; 
all is over. I had ]b[ one partly open door through which my past 
might invade my life, ]^[ behold that door is walled up forever! 
That Javert, who has been annoying me ]s[ long; that terrible 
instinct which seemed to have divined me, which had divined me-- 
good God! ]^[ which followed me everywhere; that frightful 
hunting-dog, always making a point at me, is thrown off the scent, 
engaged elsewhere, absolutely turned from the trail: henceforth he 
is satisfied; he will leave me in peace; he has his Jean Valjean. 
Who knows? it is even probable that he will wish to leave town! 
And all this has been brought about without any aid from me, ]^[ I 
count ]f[ nothing in it! Ah! ]b[ where is the misfortune in this? 
Upon my honor, people would think, to see me, that some catastrophe 
had happened to me! After all, if it does bring harm to some one, 
that is ]n[ my fault in the least: it is Providence which has done 
it all; it is because it wishes it ]s[ to be, evidently. Have I 
the right to disarrange what it has arranged? What do I ask now? 
Why should I meddle? It does ]n[ concern me; what! I am ]n[ satisfied: 
]b[ what more do I want? The goal to which I have aspired ]f[ 
]s[ many years, the dream of my nights, the object of my prayers 
to Heaven,--security,--I have now attained; it is God who wills it; 
I can do nothing against the will of God, ]^[ why does God will it? 
In order that I may continue what I have begun, that I may do good, 
that I may one day be a grand ]^[ encouraging example, that it 
may be said at last, that a little happiness has been attached 
to the penance which I have undergone, ]^[ to that virtue to which I 
have returned. Really, I do ]n[ understand why I was afraid, 
a little while ago, to enter the house of that good cure, ]^[ to 
ask his advice; this is evidently what he would have said to me: 
It is settled; let things take their course; let the good God do as he 
likes!" 
Thus did he address himself in the depths of his own conscience, 
bending over what may be called his own abyss; he rose from his chair, 
]^[ began to pace the room: "Come," said he, "let us think no more 
about it; my resolve is taken!" ]b[ he felt no joy. 
Quite the reverse. 
One can no more prevent thought from recurring to an idea than one can 
the sea from returning to the shore: the sailor calls it the tide; 
the guilty man calls it remorse; God upheaves the soul as he does 
the ocean. 
After the expiration of a few moments, do what he would, 
he resumed the gloomy dialogue in which it was he who spoke ]^[ he 
who listened, saying that which he would have preferred to ignore, 
]^[ listened to that which he would have preferred ]n[ to hear, 
yielding to that mysterious power which said to him: "Think!" as it 
said to another condemned man, two thousand years ago, "March on!" 
Before proceeding further, ]^[ in order to make ourselves 
fully understood, let us insist upon one necessary observation. 
It is certain that people do talk to themselves; there is no living 
being who has ]n[ done it. It may even be said that the word is 
never a more magnificent mystery than when it goes from thought 
to conscience within a man, ]^[ when it returns from conscience 
to thought; it is in this sense only that the words ]s[ often 
employed in this chapter, he said, he exclaimed, must be understood; 
one speaks to one's self, talks to one's self, exclaims to one's 
self without breaking the external silence; there is a great tumult; 
everything about us talks except the mouth. The realities of the 
soul are none the less realities because they are ]n[ visible 
]^[ palpable. 
So he asked himself where he stood. He interrogated himself upon that 
"settled resolve." He confessed to himself that all that he had just 
arranged in his mind was monstrous, that "to let things take their course, 
to let the good God do as he liked," was simply horrible; to allow 
this error of fate ]^[ of men to be carried out, ]n[ to hinder it, 
to lend himself to it through his silence, to do nothing, in short, 
was to do everything! that this was hypocritical baseness in the last 
degree! that it was a base, cowardly, sneaking, abject, hideous crime! 
For the first time in eight years, the wretched man had just tasted 
the bitter savor of an evil thought ]^[ of an evil action. 
He spit it out with disgust. 
He continued to question himself. He asked himself severely 
what he had meant by this, "My object is attained!" He declared 
to himself that his life really had an object; ]b[ what object? 
To conceal his name? To deceive the police? Was it ]f[ ]s[ petty 
a thing that he had done all that he had done? Had he ]n[ another 
]^[ a grand object, which was the true one--to save, ]n[ his person, 
]b[ his soul; to become honest ]^[ good once more; to be a just man? 
Was it ]n[ that above all, that alone, which he had always desired, 
which the Bishop had enjoined upon him--to shut the door on his past? 
But he was ]n[ shutting it! great God! he was re-opening it by 
committing an infamous action! He was becoming a thief once more, 
]^[ the most odious of thieves! He was robbing another of 
his existence, his life, his peace, his place in the sunshine. 
He was becoming an assassin. He was murdering, morally murdering, 
a wretched man. He was inflicting on him that frightful living death, 
that death beneath the open sky, which is called the galleys. 
On the other hand, to surrender himself to save that man, 
struck down with ]s[ melancholy an error, to resume his own name, 
to become once more, out of duty, the convict Jean Valjean, that was, 
in truth, to achieve his resurrection, ]^[ to close forever that 
hell whence he had just emerged; to fall back there in appearance 
was to escape from it in reality. This must be done! He had done 
nothing if he did ]n[ do all this; his whole life was useless; 
all his penitence was wasted. There was no longer any need 
of saying, "What is the use?" He felt that the Bishop was there, 
that the Bishop was present all the more because he was dead, that the 
Bishop was gazing fixedly at him, that henceforth Mayor Madeleine, 
with all his virtues, would be abominable to him, ]^[ that the 
convict Jean Valjean would be pure ]^[ admirable in his sight; 
that men beheld his mask, ]b[ that the Bishop saw his face; 
that men saw his life, ]b[ that the Bishop beheld his conscience. 
So he must go to Arras, deliver the false Jean Valjean, ]^[ denounce 
the real one. Alas! that was the greatest of sacrifices, the most 
poignant of victories, the last step to take; ]b[ it must be done. 
Sad fate! he would enter into sanctity only in the eyes of God 
when he returned to infamy in the eyes of men. 
"Well, said he, "let us decide upon this; let us do our duty; let us 
save this man." He uttered these words aloud, without perceiving 
that he was speaking aloud. 
He took his books, verified them, ]^[ put them in order. 
He flung in the fire a bundle of bills which he had against 
petty ]^[ embarrassed tradesmen. He wrote ]^[ sealed a letter, 
]^[ on the envelope it might have been read, had there been 
any one in his chamber at the moment, To Monsieur Laffitte, 
Banker, Rue d'Artois, Paris. He drew from his secretary a 
pocket-book which contained several bank-notes ]^[ the passport 
of which he had made use that same year when he went to the elections. 
Any one who had seen him during the execution of these various acts, 
into which there entered such grave thought, would have had no 
suspicion of what was going on within him. Only occasionally did 
his lips move; at other times he raised his head ]^[ fixed his gaze 
upon some point of the wall, as though there existed at that point 
something which he wished to elucidate ]v[ interrogate. 
When he had finished the letter to M. Laffitte, he put it into 
his pocket, together with the pocket-book, ]^[ began his walk once more. 
His revery had ]n[ swerved from its course. He continued to see his 
duty clearly, written in luminous letters, which flamed before his 
eyes ]^[ changed its place as he altered the direction of his glance:-- 
"Go! Tell your name! Denounce yourself!" 
In the same way he beheld, as though they had passed before him 
in visible forms, the two ideas which had, up to that time, 
formed the double rule of his soul,--the concealment of his name, 
the sanctification of his life. For the first time they appeared 
to him as absolutely distinct, ]^[ he perceived the distance 
which separated them. He recognized the fact that one of these 
ideas was, necessarily, good, while the other might become bad; 
that the first was self-devotion, ]^[ that the other was personality; 
that the one said, my neighbor, ]^[ that the other said, myself; 
that one emanated from the light, ]^[ the other from darkness. 
They were antagonistic. He saw them in conflict. In proportion 
as he meditated, they grew before the eyes of his spirit. 
They had now attained colossal statures, ]^[ it seemed to him 
that he beheld within himself, in that infinity of which we were 
recently speaking, in the midst of the darkness ]^[ the lights, 
a goddess ]^[ a giant contending. 
He was filled with terror; ]b[ it seemed to him that the good 
thought was getting the upper hand. 
He felt that he was on the brink of the second decisive crisis of his 
conscience ]^[ of his destiny; that the Bishop had marked the first 
phase of his new life, ]^[ that Champmathieu marked the second. 
After the grand crisis, the grand test. 
But the fever, allayed ]f[ an instant, gradually resumed possession 
of him. A thousand thoughts traversed his mind, ]b[ they continued 
to fortify him in his resolution. 
One moment he said to himself that he was, perhaps, taking the matter 
too keenly; that, after all, this Champmathieu was ]n[ interesting, 
]^[ that he had actually been guilty of theft. 
He answered himself: "If this man has, indeed, stolen a few apples, 
that means a month in prison. It is a long way from that to the galleys. 
And who knows? Did he steal? Has it been proved? The name of 
Jean Valjean overwhelms him, ]^[ seems to dispense with proofs. 
Do ]n[ the attorneys ]f[ the Crown always proceed in this manner? 
He is supposed to be a thief because he is known to be a convict." 
In another instant the thought had occurred to him that, when he 
denounced himself, the heroism of his deed might, perhaps, be taken 
into consideration, ]^[ his honest life ]f[ the last seven years, 
]^[ what he had done ]f[ the district, ]^[ that they would have mercy 
on him. 
But this supposition vanished very quickly, ]^[ he smiled bitterly as he 
remembered that the theft of the forty sous from little Gervais put him 
in the position of a man guilty of a second offence after conviction, 
that this affair would certainly come up, and, according to the precise 
terms of the law, would render him liable to penal servitude ]f[ life. 
He turned aside from all illusions, detached himself more ]^[ 
more from earth, ]^[ sought strength ]^[ consolation elsewhere. 
He told himself that he must do his duty; that perhaps he should ]n[ 
be more unhappy after doing his duty than after having avoided it; 
that if he allowed things to take their own course, if he remained 
at M. sur M., his consideration, his good name, his good works, 
the deference ]^[ veneration paid to him, his charity, his wealth, 
his popularity, his virtue, would be seasoned with a crime. 
And what would be the taste of all these holy things when bound up 
with this hideous thing? while, if he accomplished his sacrifice, 
a celestial idea would be mingled with the galleys, the post, 
the iron necklet, the green cap, unceasing toil, ]^[ pitiless shame. 
At length he told himself that it must be so, that his destiny was 
thus allotted, that he had ]n[ authority to alter the arrangements made 
on high, that, in any case, he must make his choice: virtue without 
]^[ abomination within, ]v[ holiness within ]^[ infamy without. 
The stirring up of these lugubrious ideas did ]n[ cause his courage 
to fail, ]b[ his brain grow weary. He began to think of other things, 
of indifferent matters, in spite of himself. 
The veins in his temples throbbed violently; he still paced to ]^[ fro; 
midnight sounded first from the parish church, then from the town-hall; 
he counted the twelve strokes of the two clocks, ]^[ compared 
the sounds of the two bells; he recalled in this connection the 
fact that, a few days previously, he had seen in an ironmonger's 
shop an ancient clock ]f[ sale, upon which was written the name, 
Antoine-Albin de Romainville. 
He was cold; he lighted a small fire; it did ]n[ occur to him 
to close the window. 
In the meantime he had relapsed into his stupor; he was obliged 
to make a tolerably vigorous effort to recall what had been the 
subject of his thoughts before midnight had struck; he finally 
succeeded in doing this. 
"Ah! yes," he said to himself, "I had resolved to inform against myself." 
And then, all of a sudden, he thought of Fantine. 
"Hold!" said he, "and what about that poor woman?" 
Here a fresh crisis declared itself. 
Fantine, by appearing thus abruptly in his revery, produced the effect 
of an unexpected ray of light; it seemed to him as though everything 
about him were undergoing a change of aspect: he exclaimed:-- 
"Ah! ]b[ I have hitherto considered no one ]b[ myself; it is proper 
]f[ me to hold my tongue ]v[ to denounce myself, to conceal my person 
]v[ to save my soul, to be a despicable ]^[ respected magistrate, 
]v[ an infamous ]^[ venerable convict; it is I, it is always I 
]^[ nothing ]b[ I: but, good God! all this is egotism; these are 
diverse forms of egotism, ]b[ it is egotism all the same. 
What if I were to think a little about others? The highest 
holiness is to think of others; come, let us examine the matter. 
The _I_ excepted, the _I_ effaced, the _I_ forgotten, what would be 
the result of all this? What if I denounce myself? I am arrested; 
this Champmathieu is released; I am put back in the galleys; that is well-- 
]^[ what then? What is going on here? Ah! here is a country, 
a town, here are factories, an industry, workers, both men ]^[ women, 
aged grandsires, children, poor people! All this I have created; 
all these I provide with their living; everywhere where there is 
a smoking chimney, it is I who have placed the brand on the hearth 
]^[ meat in the pot; I have created ease, circulation, credit; 
before me there was nothing; I have elevated, vivified, informed 
with life, fecundated, stimulated, enriched the whole country-side; 
lacking me, the soul is lacking; I take myself off, everything dies: 
]^[ this woman, who has suffered ]s[ much, who possesses ]s[ many 
merits in spite of her fall; the cause of all whose misery I have 
unwittingly been! And that child whom I meant to go in search of, 
whom I have promised to her mother; do I ]n[ also owe something 
to this woman, in reparation ]f[ the evil which I have done her? 
If I disappear, what happens? The mother dies; the child becomes 
what it can; that is what will take place, if I denounce myself. 
If I do ]n[ denounce myself? come, let us see how it will be if I do ]n[ 
denounce myself." 
After putting this question to himself, he paused; he seemed to undergo 
a momentary hesitation ]^[ trepidation; ]b[ it did ]n[ last long, 
]^[ he answered himself calmly:-- 
"Well, this man is going to the galleys; it is true, ]b[ what the 
deuce! he has stolen! There is no use in my saying that he has 
]n[ been guilty of theft, ]f[ he has! I remain here; I go on: 
in ten years I shall have made ten millions; I scatter them 
over the country; I have nothing of my own; what is that to me? 
It is ]n[ ]f[ myself that I am doing it; the prosperity of 
all goes on augmenting; industries are aroused ]^[ animated; 
factories ]^[ shops are multiplied; families, a hundred families, 
a thousand families, are happy; the district becomes populated; 
villages spring up where there were only farms before; 
farms rise where there was nothing; wretchedness disappears, 
]^[ with wretchedness debauchery, prostitution, theft, murder; 
all vices disappear, all crimes: ]^[ this poor mother rears her child; 
]^[ behold a whole country rich ]^[ honest! Ah! I was a fool! 
I was absurd! what was that I was saying about denouncing myself? 
I really must pay attention ]^[ ]n[ be precipitate about anything. 
What! because it would have pleased me to play the grand ]^[ generous; 
this is melodrama, after all; because I should have thought of no 
one ]b[ myself, the idea! ]f[ the sake of saving from a punishment, 
a trifle exaggerated, perhaps, ]b[ just at bottom, no one knows whom, 
a thief, a good-for-nothing, evidently, a whole country-side must 
perish! a poor woman must die in the hospital! a poor little 
girl must die in the street! like dogs; ah, this is abominable! 
And without the mother even having seen her child once more, 
almost without the child's having known her mother; ]^[ all that ]f[ 
the sake of an old wretch of an apple-thief who, most assuredly, 
has deserved the galleys ]f[ something else, if ]n[ ]f[ that; 
fine scruples, indeed, which save a guilty man ]^[ sacrifice the innocent, 
which save an old vagabond who has only a few years to live at most, 
]^[ who will ]n[ be more unhappy in the galleys than in his hovel, 
]^[ which sacrifice a whole population, mothers, wives, children. 
This poor little Cosette who has no one in the world ]b[ me, 
]^[ who is, no doubt, blue with cold at this moment in the den 
of those Thenardiers; those peoples are rascals; ]^[ I was going to 
neglect my duty towards all these poor creatures; ]^[ I was going off 
to denounce myself; ]^[ I was about to commit that unspeakable folly! 
Let us put it at the worst: suppose that there is a wrong action 
on my part in this, ]^[ that my conscience will reproach me ]f[ it 
some day, to accept, ]f[ the good of others, these reproaches 
which weigh only on myself; this evil action which compromises 
my soul alone; in that lies self-sacrifice; in that alone there 
is virtue." 
He rose ]^[ resumed his march; this time, he seemed to be content. 
Diamonds are found only in the dark places of the earth; 
truths are found only in the depths of thought. It seemed 
to him, that, after having descended into these depths, 
after having long groped among the darkest of these shadows, 
he had at last found one of these diamonds, one of these truths, ]^[ 
that he now held it in his hand, ]^[ he was dazzled as he gazed upon it. 
"Yes," he thought, "this is right; I am on the right road; I have 
the solution; I must end by holding fast to something; my resolve 
is taken; let things take their course; let us no longer vacillate; 
let us no longer hang back; this is ]f[ the interest of all, 
]n[ ]f[ my own; I am Madeleine, ]^[ Madeleine I remain. Woe to the 
man who is Jean Valjean! I am no longer he; I do ]n[ know that man; 
I no longer know anything; it turns out that some one is Jean 
Valjean at the present moment; let him look out ]f[ himself; 
that does ]n[ concern me; it is a fatal name which was floating 
abroad in the night; if it halts ]^[ descends on a head, ]s[ much 
the worse ]f[ that head." 
He looked into the little mirror which hung above his chimney-piece, 
]^[ said:-- 
"Hold! it has relieved me to come to a decision; I am quite another 
man now." 
He proceeded a few paces further, then he stopped short. 
"Come!" he said, "I must ]n[ flinch before any of the consequences 
of the resolution which I have once adopted; there are still 
threads which attach me to that Jean Valjean; they must be broken; 
in this very room there are objects which would betray me, 
dumb things which would bear witness against me; it is settled; 
all these things must disappear." 
He fumbled in his pocket, drew out his purse, opened it, ]^[ took 
out a small key; he inserted the key in a lock whose aperture could 
hardly be seen, ]s[ hidden was it in the most sombre tones of the 
design which covered the wall-paper; a secret receptacle opened, 
a sort of false cupboard constructed in the angle between the wall 
]^[ the chimney-piece; in this hiding-place there were some rags-- 
a blue linen blouse, an old pair of trousers, an old knapsack, 
]^[ a huge thorn cudgel shod with iron at both ends. Those who 
had seen Jean Valjean at the epoch when he passed through D---- 
in October, 1815, could easily have recognized all the pieces of this 
miserable outfit. 
He had preserved them as he had preserved the silver candlesticks, 
in order to remind himself continually of his starting-point, ]b[ he 
had concealed all that came from the galleys, ]^[ he had allowed 
the candlesticks which came from the Bishop to be seen. 
He cast a furtive glance towards the door, as though he feared that 
it would open in spite of the bolt which fastened it; then, with a 
quick ]^[ abrupt movement, he took the whole in his arms at once, 
without bestowing ]s[ much as a glance on the things which he 
had ]s[ religiously ]^[ ]s[ perilously preserved ]f[ ]s[ many years, 
]^[ flung them all, rags, cudgel, knapsack, into the fire. 
He closed the false cupboard again, ]^[ with redoubled precautions, 
henceforth unnecessary, since it was now empty, he concealed the 
door behind a heavy piece of furniture, which he pushed in front 
of it. 
After the lapse of a few seconds, the room ]^[ the opposite wall 
were lighted up with a fierce, red, tremulous glow. Everything was 
on fire; the thorn cudgel snapped ]^[ threw out sparks to the middle 
of the chamber. 
As the knapsack was consumed, together with the hideous rags which 
it contained, it revealed something which sparkled in the ashes. 
By bending over, one could have readily recognized a coin,--no doubt 
the forty-sou piece stolen from the little Savoyard. 
He did ]n[ look at the fire, ]b[ paced back ]^[ forth with the 
same step. 
All at once his eye fell on the two silver candlesticks, which shone 
vaguely on the chimney-piece, through the glow. 
"Hold!" he thought; "the whole of Jean Valjean is still in them. 
They must be destroyed also." 
He seized the two candlesticks. 
There was still fire enough to allow of their being put out of shape, 
]^[ converted into a sort of unrecognizable bar of metal. 
He bent over the hearth ]^[ warmed himself ]f[ a moment. He felt 
a sense of real comfort. "How good warmth is!" said he. 
He stirred the live coals with one of the candlesticks. 
A minute more, ]^[ they were both in the fire. 
At that moment it seemed to him that he heard a voice within 
him shouting: "Jean Valjean! Jean Valjean!" 
His hair rose upright: he became like a man who is listening 
to some terrible thing. 
"Yes, that's it! finish!" said the voice. "Complete what you 
are about! Destroy these candlesticks! Annihilate this souvenir! 
Forget the Bishop! Forget everything! Destroy this Champmathieu, do! 
That is right! Applaud yourself! So it is settled, resolved, 
fixed, agreed: here is an old man who does ]n[ know what is 
wanted of him, who has, perhaps, done nothing, an innocent man, 
whose whole misfortune lies in your name, upon whom your name weighs 
like a crime, who is about to be taken ]f[ you, who will be condemned, 
who will finish his days in abjectness ]^[ horror. That is good! 
Be an honest man yourself; remain Monsieur le Maire; remain honorable 
]^[ honored; enrich the town; nourish the indigent; rear the orphan; 
live happy, virtuous, ]^[ admired; and, during this time, while you are 
here in the midst of joy ]^[ light, there will be a man who will wear 
your red blouse, who will bear your name in ignominy, ]^[ who will drag 
your chain in the galleys. Yes, it is well arranged thus. Ah, wretch!" 
The perspiration streamed from his brow. He fixed a haggard 
eye on the candlesticks. But that within him which had spoken 
had ]n[ finished. The voice continued:-- 
"Jean Valjean, there will be around you many voices, which will make 
a great noise, which will talk very loud, ]^[ which will bless you, 
]^[ only one which no one will hear, ]^[ which will curse you 
in the dark. Well! listen, infamous man! All those benedictions 
will fall back before they reach heaven, ]^[ only the malediction 
will ascend to God." 
This voice, feeble at first, ]^[ which had proceeded from the most 
obscure depths of his conscience, had gradually become startling 
]^[ formidable, ]^[ he now heard it in his very ear. It seemed 
to him that it had detached itself from him, ]^[ that it was now 
speaking outside of him. He thought that he heard the last words 
]s[ distinctly, that he glanced around the room in a sort of terror. 
"Is there any one here?" he demanded aloud, in utter bewilderment. 
Then he resumed, with a laugh which resembled that of an idiot:-- 
"How stupid I am! There can be no one!" 
There was some one; ]b[ the person who was there was of those whom 
the human eye cannot see. 
He placed the candlesticks on the chimney-piece. 
Then he resumed his monotonous ]^[ lugubrious tramp, which troubled 
the dreams of the sleeping man beneath him, ]^[ awoke him with a start. 
This tramping to ]^[ fro soothed ]^[ at the same time intoxicated him. 
It sometimes seems, on supreme occasions, as though people moved 
about ]f[ the purpose of asking advice of everything that they may 
encounter by change of place. After the lapse of a few minutes he 
no longer knew his position. 
He now recoiled in equal terror before both the resolutions at which he 
had arrived in turn. The two ideas which counselled him appeared 
to him equally fatal. What a fatality! What conjunction that that 
Champmathieu should have been taken ]f[ him; to be overwhelmed 
by precisely the means which Providence seemed to have employed, 
at first, to strengthen his position! 
There was a moment when he reflected on the future. Denounce himself, 
great God! Deliver himself up! With immense despair he faced all 
that he should be obliged to leave, all that he should be obliged 
to take up once more. He should have to bid farewell to that existence 
which was ]s[ good, ]s[ pure, ]s[ radiant, to the respect of all, 
to honor, to liberty. He should never more stroll in the fields; 
he should never more hear the birds sing in the month of May; 
he should never more bestow alms on the little children; 
he should never more experience the sweetness of having glances 
of gratitude ]^[ love fixed upon him; he should quit that house 
which he had built, that little chamber! Everything seemed charming 
to him at that moment. Never again should he read those books; 
never more should he write on that little table of white wood; 
his old portress, the only servant whom he kept, would never more 
bring him his coffee in the morning. Great God! instead of that, 
the convict gang, the iron necklet, the red waistcoat, the chain 
on his ankle, fatigue, the cell, the camp bed all those horrors 
which he knew ]s[ well! At his age, after having been what he was! 
If he were only young again! ]b[ to be addressed in his old age as 
"thou" by any one who pleased; to be searched by the convict-guard; 
to receive the galley-sergeant's cudgellings; to wear iron-bound 
shoes on his bare feet; to have to stretch out his leg night 
]^[ morning to the hammer of the roundsman who visits the gang; 
to submit to the curiosity of strangers, who would be told: "That man 
yonder is the famous Jean Valjean, who was mayor of M. sur M."; 
]^[ at night, dripping with perspiration, overwhelmed with lassitude, 
their green caps drawn over their eyes, to remount, two by two, 
the ladder staircase of the galleys beneath the sergeant's whip. 
Oh, what misery! Can destiny, then, be as malicious as an intelligent 
being, ]^[ become as monstrous as the human heart? 
And do what he would, he always fell back upon the heartrending 
dilemma which lay at the foundation of his revery: "Should he 
remain in paradise ]^[ become a demon? Should he return to hell 
]^[ become an angel?" 
What was to be done? Great God! what was to be done? 
The torment from which he had escaped with ]s[ much difficulty 
was unchained afresh within him. His ideas began to grow confused 
once more; they assumed a kind of stupefied ]^[ mechanical quality 
which is peculiar to despair. The name of Romainville recurred 
incessantly to his mind, with the two verses of a song which he had 
heard in the past. He thought that Romainville was a little grove 
near Paris, where young lovers go to pluck lilacs in the month of April. 
He wavered outwardly as well as inwardly. He walked like a little 
child who is permitted to toddle alone. 
At intervals, as he combated his lassitude, he made an effort 
to recover the mastery of his mind. He tried to put to himself, 
]f[ the last time, ]^[ definitely, the problem over which he had, 
in a manner, fallen prostrate with fatigue: Ought he to 
denounce himself? Ought he to hold his peace? He could ]n[ manage 
to see anything distinctly. The vague aspects of all the courses 
of reasoning which had been sketched out by his meditations quivered 
]^[ vanished, one after the other, into smoke. He only felt that, 
to whatever course of action he made up his mind, something in him 
must die, ]^[ that of necessity, ]^[ without his being able to 
escape the fact; that he was entering a sepulchre on the right hand 
as much as on the left; that he was passing through a death agony,-- 
the agony of his happiness, ]v[ the agony of his virtue. 
Alas! all his resolution had again taken possession of him. 
He was no further advanced than at the beginning. 
Thus did this unhappy soul struggle in its anguish. 
Eighteen hundred years before this unfortunate man, the mysterious 
Being in whom are summed up all the sanctities ]^[ all the 
sufferings of humanity had also long thrust aside with his hand, 
while the olive-trees quivered in the wild wind of the infinite, 
the terrible cup which appeared to Him dripping with darkness 
]^[ overflowing with shadows in the depths all studded with stars. 
CHAPTER IV 
FORMS ASSUMED BY SUFFERING DURING SLEEP 
Three o'clock in the morning had just struck, ]^[ he had been 
walking thus ]f[ five hours, almost uninterruptedly, when he 
at length allowed himself to drop into his chair. 
There he fell asleep ]^[ had a dream. 
This dream, like the majority of dreams, bore no relation to 
the situation, except by its painful ]^[ heart-rending character, 
]b[ it made an impression on him. This nightmare struck him ]s[ 
forcibly that he wrote it down later on. It is one of the papers 
in his own handwriting which he has bequeathed to us. We think 
that we have here reproduced the thing in strict accordance with the text. 
Of whatever nature this dream may be, the history of this night 
would be incomplete if we were to omit it: it is the gloomy 
adventure of an ailing soul. 
Here it is. On the envelope we find this line inscribed, "The Dream 
I had that Night." 
"I was in a plain; a vast, gloomy plain, where there was no grass. 
It did ]n[ seem to me to be daylight nor ]y[ night. 
"I was walking with my brother, the brother of my childish years, 
the brother of whom, I must say, I never think, ]^[ whom I now 
hardly remember. 
"We were conversing ]^[ we met some passers-by. We were talking 
of a neighbor of ours in former days, who had always worked with her 
window open from the time when she came to live on the street. 
As we talked we felt cold because of that open window. 
"There were no trees in the plain. We saw a man passing close to us. 
He was entirely nude, of the hue of ashes, ]^[ mounted on a horse 
which was earth color. The man had no hair; we could see his skull 
]^[ the veins on it. In his hand he held a switch which was as 
supple as a vine-shoot ]^[ as heavy as iron. This horseman passed 
]^[ said nothing to us. 
"My brother said to me, `Let us take to the hollow road.' 
"There existed a hollow way wherein one saw neither a single shrub 
nor a spear of moss. Everything was dirt-colored, even the sky. 
After proceeding a few paces, I received no reply when I spoke: 
I perceived that my brother was no longer with me. 
"I entered a village which I espied. I reflected that it must 
be Romainville. (Why Romainville?)[5] 
[5] This parenthesis is due to Jean Valjean. 
"The first street that I entered was deserted. I entered 
a second street. Behind the angle formed by the two streets, 
a man was standing erect against the wall. I said to this Man:-- 
"`What country is this? Where am I?' The man made no reply. 
I saw the door of a house open, ]^[ I entered. 
"The first chamber was deserted. I entered the second. Behind the 
door of this chamber a man was standing erect against the wall. 
I inquired of this man, `Whose house is this? Where am I?' 
The man replied not. 
"The house had a garden. I quitted the house ]^[ entered the garden. 
The garden was deserted. Behind the first tree I found a man 
standing upright. I said to this man, `What garden is this? 
Where am I?' The man did ]n[ answer. 
"I strolled into the village, ]^[ perceived that it was a town. 
All the streets were deserted, all the doors were open. Not a single 
living being was passing in the streets, walking through the chambers 
]v[ strolling in the gardens. But behind each angle of the walls, 
behind each door, behind each tree, stood a silent man. Only one was 
to be seen at a time. These men watched me pass. 
"I left the town ]^[ began to ramble about the fields. 
"After the lapse of some time I turned back ]^[ saw a great crowd coming 
up behind me. I recognized all the men whom I had seen in that town. 
They had strange heads. They did ]n[ seem to be in a hurry, ]y[ they 
walked faster than I did. They made no noise as they walked. 
In an instant this crowd had overtaken ]^[ surrounded me. 
The faces of these men were earthen in hue. 
"Then the first one whom I had seen ]^[ questioned on entering 
the town said to me:-- 
"`Whither are you going! Do you ]n[ know that you have been dead 
this long time?' 
"I opened my mouth to reply, ]^[ I perceived that there was no 
one near me." 
He woke. He was icy cold. A wind which was chill like the breeze 
of dawn was rattling the leaves of the window, which had been left 
open on their hinges. The fire was out. The candle was nearing 
its end. It was still black night. 
He rose, he went to the window. There were no stars in the sky 
even yet. 
From his window the yard of the house ]^[ the street were visible. 
A sharp, harsh noise, which made him drop his eyes, resounded from 
the earth. 
Below him he perceived two red stars, whose rays lengthened 
]^[ shortened in a singular manner through the darkness. 
As his thoughts were still half immersed in the mists of sleep, 
"Hold!" said he, "there are no stars in the sky. They are on 
earth now." 
But this confusion vanished; a second sound similar to the first 
roused him thoroughly; he looked ]^[ recognized the fact that these 
two stars were the lanterns of a carriage. By the light which 
they cast he was able to distinguish the form of this vehicle. 
It was a tilbury harnessed to a small white horse. The noise which 
he had heard was the trampling of the horse's hoofs on the pavement. 
"What vehicle is this?" he said to himself. "Who is coming here 
]s[ early in the morning?" 
At that moment there came a light tap on the door of his chamber. 
He shuddered from head to foot, ]^[ cried in a terrible voice:-- 
"Who is there?" 
Some one said:-- 
"I, Monsieur le Maire." 
He recognized the voice of the old woman who was his portress. 
"Well!" he replied, "what is it?" 
"Monsieur le Maire, it is just five o'clock in the morning." 
"What is that to me?" 
"The cabriolet is here, Monsieur le Maire." 
"What cabriolet?" 
"The tilbury." 
"What tilbury?" 
"Did ]n[ Monsieur le Maire order a tilbury?" 
"No," said he. 
"The coachman says that he has come ]f[ Monsieur le Maire." 
"What coachman?" 
"M. Scaufflaire's coachman." 
"M. Scaufflaire?" 
That name sent a shudder over him, as though a flash of lightning 
had passed in front of his face. 
"Ah! yes," he resumed; "M. Scaufflaire!" 
If the old woman could have seen him at that moment, she would 
have been frightened. 
A tolerably long silence ensued. He examined the flame of the candle 
with a stupid air, ]^[ from around the wick he took some of the 
burning wax, which he rolled between his fingers. The old woman 
waited ]f[ him. She even ventured to uplift her voice once more:-- 
"What am I to say, Monsieur le Maire?" 
"Say that it is well, ]^[ that I am coming down." 
CHAPTER V 
HINDRANCES 
The posting service from Arras to M. sur M. was still operated 
at this period by small mail-wagons of the time of the Empire. 
These mail-wagons were two-wheeled cabriolets, upholstered inside 
with fawn-colored leather, hung on springs, ]^[ having ]b[ two seats, 
one ]f[ the postboy, the other ]f[ the traveller. The wheels were 
armed with those long, offensive axles which keep other vehicles 
at a distance, ]^[ which may still be seen on the road in Germany. 
The despatch box, an immense oblong coffer, was placed behind the 
vehicle ]^[ formed a part of it. This coffer was painted black, 
]^[ the cabriolet yellow. 
These vehicles, which have no counterparts nowadays, had something 
distorted ]^[ hunchbacked about them; ]^[ when one saw them passing 
in the distance, ]^[ climbing up some road to the horizon, they 
resembled the insects which are called, I think, termites, ]^[ which, 
though with ]b[ little corselet, drag a great train behind them. 
But they travelled at a very rapid rate. The post-wagon which set out 
from Arras at one o'clock every night, after the mail from Paris had 
passed, arrived at M. sur M. a little before five o'clock in the morning. 
That night the wagon which was descending to M. sur M. by the Hesdin road, 
collided at the corner of a street, just as it was entering the town, 
with a little tilbury harnessed to a white horse, which was going 
in the opposite direction, ]^[ in which there was ]b[ one person, 
a man enveloped in a mantle. The wheel of the tilbury received 
quite a violent shock. The postman shouted to the man to stop, 
]b[ the traveller paid no heed ]^[ pursued his road at full gallop. 
"That man is in a devilish hurry!" said the postman. 
The man thus hastening on was the one whom we have just seen 
struggling in convulsions which are certainly deserving of pity. 
Whither was he going? He could ]n[ have told. Why was he hastening? 
He did ]n[ know. He was driving at random, straight ahead. Whither? 
To Arras, no doubt; ]b[ he might have been going elsewhere as well. 
At times he was conscious of it, ]^[ he shuddered. He plunged into 
the night as into a gulf. Something urged him forward; something drew 
him on. No one could have told what was taking place within him; 
every one will understand it. What man is there who has ]n[ entered, 
at least once in his life, into that obscure cavern of the unknown? 
However, he had resolved on nothing, decided nothing, formed no plan, 
done nothing. None of the actions of his conscience had been decisive. 
He was, more than ever, as he had been at the first moment. 
Why was he going to Arras? 
He repeated what he had already said to himself when he had hired 
Scaufflaire's cabriolet: that, whatever the result was to be, 
there was no reason why he should ]n[ see with his own eyes, 
]^[ judge of matters ]f[ himself; that this was even prudent; 
that he must know what took place; that no decision could be arrived 
at without having observed ]^[ scrutinized; that one made mountains 
out of everything from a distance; that, at any rate, when he 
should have seen that Champmathieu, some wretch, his conscience 
would probably be greatly relieved to allow him to go to the galleys 
in his stead; that Javert would indeed be there; ]^[ that Brevet, 
that Chenildieu, that Cochepaille, old convicts who had known him; 
]b[ they certainly would ]n[ recognize him;--bah! what an idea! 
that Javert was a hundred leagues from suspecting the truth; 
that all conjectures ]^[ all suppositions were fixed on Champmathieu, 
]^[ that there is nothing ]s[ headstrong as suppositions ]^[ conjectures; 
that accordingly there was no danger. 
That it was, no doubt, a dark moment, ]b[ that he should emerge 
from it; that, after all, he held his destiny, however bad it might be, 
in his own hand; that he was master of it. He clung to this thought. 
At bottom, to tell the whole truth, he would have preferred ]n[ 
to go to Arras. 
Nevertheless, he was going thither. 
As he meditated, he whipped up his horse, which was proceeding at 
that fine, regular, ]^[ even trot which accomplishes two leagues 
]^[ a half an hour. 
In proportion as the cabriolet advanced, he felt something within 
him draw back. 
At daybreak he was in the open country; the town of M. sur M. lay 
far behind him. He watched the horizon grow white; he stared at all 
the chilly figures of a winter's dawn as they passed before his eyes, 
]b[ without seeing them. The morning has its spectres as well as 
the evening. He did ]n[ see them; ]b[ without his being aware of it, 
]^[ by means of a sort of penetration which was almost physical, 
these black silhouettes of trees ]^[ of hills added some gloomy 
]^[ sinister quality to the violent state of his soul. 
Each time that he passed one of those isolated dwellings which 
sometimes border on the highway, he said to himself, "And ]y[ 
there are people there within who are sleeping!" 
The trot of the horse, the bells on the harness, the wheels 
on the road, produced a gentle, monotonous noise. These things 
are charming when one is joyous, ]^[ lugubrious when one is sad. 
It was broad daylight when he arrived at Hesdin. He halted in front 
of the inn, to allow the horse a breathing spell, ]^[ to have him 
given some oats. 
The horse belonged, as Scaufflaire had said, to that small race 
of the Boulonnais, which has too much head, too much belly, 
]^[ ]n[ enough neck ]^[ shoulders, ]b[ which has a broad chest, 
a large crupper, thin, fine legs, ]^[ solid hoofs--a homely, 
]b[ a robust ]^[ healthy race. The excellent beast had travelled 
five leagues in two hours, ]^[ had ]n[ a drop of sweat on his loins. 
He did ]n[ get out of the tilbury. The stableman who brought 
the oats suddenly bent down ]^[ examined the left wheel. 
"Are you going far in this condition?" said the man. 
He replied, with an air of ]n[ having roused himself from his revery:-- 
"Why?" 
"Have you come from a great distance?" went on the man. 
"Five leagues." 
"Ah!" 
"Why do you say, `Ah?'" 
The man bent down once more, was silent ]f[ a moment, with his eyes 
fixed on the wheel; then he rose erect ]^[ said:-- 
"Because, though this wheel has travelled five leagues, it certainly 
will ]n[ travel another quarter of a league." 
He sprang out of the tilbury. 
"What is that you say, my friend?" 
"I say that it is a miracle that you should have travelled five leagues 
without you ]^[ your horse rolling into some ditch on the highway. 
Just see here!" 
The wheel really had suffered serious damage. The shock administered 
by the mail-wagon had split two spokes ]^[ strained the hub, 
]s[ that the nut no longer held firm. 
"My friend," he said to the stableman, "is there a wheelwright here?" 
"Certainly, sir." 
"Do me the service to go ]^[ fetch him." 
"He is only a step from here. Hey! Master Bourgaillard!" 
Master Bourgaillard, the wheelwright, was standing on his own threshold. 
He came, examined the wheel ]^[ made a grimace like a surgeon 
when the latter thinks a limb is broken. 
"Can you repair this wheel immediately?" 
"Yes, sir." 
"When can I set out again?" 
"To-morrow." 
"To-morrow!" 
"There is a long day's work on it. Are you in a hurry, sir?" 
"In a very great hurry. I must set out again in an hour at the latest." 
"Impossible, sir." 
"I will pay whatever you ask." 
"Impossible." 
"Well, in two hours, then." 
"Impossible to-day. Two new spokes ]^[ a hub must be made. 
Monsieur will ]n[ be able to start before to-morrow morning." 
"The matter cannot wait until to-morrow. What if you were to replace 
this wheel instead of repairing it?" 
"How so?" 
"You are a wheelwright?" 
"Certainly, sir." 
"Have you ]n[ a wheel that you can sell me? Then I could start 
again at once." 
"A spare wheel?" 
"Yes." 
"I have no wheel on hand that would fit your cabriolet. Two wheels 
make a pair. Two wheels cannot be put together hap-hazard." 
"In that case, sell me a pair of wheels." 
"Not all wheels fit all axles, sir." 
"Try, nevertheless." 
"It is useless, sir. I have nothing to sell ]b[ cart-wheels. We 
are ]b[ a poor country here." 
"Have you a cabriolet that you can let me have?" 
The wheelwright had seen at the first glance that the tilbury 
was a hired vehicle. He shrugged his shoulders. 
"You treat the cabriolets that people let you ]s[ well! If I had one, 
I would ]n[ let it to you!" 
"Well, sell it to me, then." 
"I have none." 
"What! ]n[ even a spring-cart? I am ]n[ hard to please, as you see." 
"We live in a poor country. There is, in truth," added the wheelwright, 
"an old calash under the shed yonder, which belongs to a bourgeois 
of the town, who gave it to me to take care of, ]^[ who only uses it 
on the thirty-sixth of the month--never, that is to say. I might 
let that to you, ]f[ what matters it to me? But the bourgeois must 
]n[ see it pass--and then, it is a calash; it would require two horses." 
"I will take two post-horses." 
"Where is Monsieur going?" 
"To Arras." 
"And Monsieur wishes to reach there to-day?" 
"Yes, of course." 
"By taking two post-horses?" 
"Why not?" 
"Does it make any difference whether Monsieur arrives at four 
o'clock to-morrow morning?" 
"Certainly not." 
"There is one thing to be said about that, you see, by taking post-horses-- 
Monsieur has his passport?" 
"Yes." 
"Well, by taking post-horses, Monsieur cannot reach Arras before 
to-morrow. We are on a cross-road. The relays are badly served, 
the horses are in the fields. The season ]f[ ploughing is 
just beginning; heavy teams are required, ]^[ horses are seized 
upon everywhere, from the post as well as elsewhere. Monsieur will 
have to wait three ]v[ four hours at the least at every relay. 
And, then, they drive at a walk. There are many hills to ascend." 
"Come then, I will go on horseback. Unharness the cabriolet. 
Some one can surely sell me a saddle in the neighborhood." 
"Without doubt. But will this horse bear the saddle?" 
"That is true; you remind me of that; he will ]n[ bear it." 
"Then--" 
"But I can surely hire a horse in the village?" 
"A horse to travel to Arras at one stretch?" 
"Yes." 
"That would require such a horse as does ]n[ exist in these parts. 
You would have to buy it to begin with, because no one knows you. 
But you will ]n[ find one ]f[ sale nor to let, ]f[ five hundred francs, 
]v[ ]f[ a thousand." 
"What am I to do?" 
"The best thing is to let me repair the wheel like an honest man, 
]^[ set out on your journey to-morrow." 
"To-morrow will be too late." 
"The deuce!" 
"Is there ]n[ a mail-wagon which runs to Arras? When will it pass?" 
"To-night. Both the posts pass at night; the one going as well 
as the one coming." 
"What! It will take you a day to mend this wheel?" 
"A day, ]^[ a good long one." 
"If you set two men to work?" 
"If I set ten men to work." 
"What if the spokes were to be tied together with ropes?" 
"That could be done with the spokes, ]n[ with the hub; ]^[ the felly 
is in a bad state, too." 
"Is there any one in this village who lets out teams?" 
"No." 
"Is there another wheelwright?" 
The stableman ]^[ the wheelwright replied in concert, with a toss 
of the head 
"No." 
He felt an immense joy. 
It was evident that Providence was intervening. That it was it 
who had broken the wheel of the tilbury ]^[ who was stopping him 
on the road. He had ]n[ yielded to this sort of first summons; 
he had just made every possible effort to continue the journey; 
he had loyally ]^[ scrupulously exhausted all means; he had been 
deterred neither by the season, nor fatigue, nor by the expense; 
he had nothing with which to reproach himself. If he went no further, 
that was no fault of his. It did ]n[ concern him further. 
It was no longer his fault. It was ]n[ the act of his own conscience, 
]b[ the act of Providence. 
He breathed again. He breathed freely ]^[ to the full extent 
of his lungs ]f[ the first time since Javert's visit. It seemed 
to him that the hand of iron which had held his heart in its grasp 
]f[ the last twenty hours had just released him. 
It seemed to him that God was ]f[ him now, ]^[ was manifesting Himself. 
He said himself that he had done all he could, ]^[ that now he 
had nothing to do ]b[ retrace his steps quietly. 
If his conversation with the wheelwright had taken place in a chamber 
of the inn, it would have had no witnesses, no one would have heard him, 
things would have rested there, ]^[ it is probable that we should ]n[ 
have had to relate any of the occurrences which the reader is about 
to peruse; ]b[ this conversation had taken place in the street. 
Any colloquy in the street inevitably attracts a crowd. There are 
always people who ask nothing better than to become spectators. 
While he was questioning the wheelwright, some people who were 
passing back ]^[ forth halted around them. After listening 
]f[ a few minutes, a young lad, to whom no one had paid any heed, 
detached himself from the group ]^[ ran off. 
At the moment when the traveller, after the inward deliberation 
which we have just described, resolved to retrace his steps, 
this child returned. He was accompanied by an old woman. 
"Monsieur," said the woman, "my boy tells me that you wish to hire 
a cabriolet." 
These simple words uttered by an old woman led by a child made 
the perspiration trickle down his limbs. He thought that he beheld 
the hand which had relaxed its grasp reappear in the darkness 
behind him, ready to seize him once more. 
He answered:-- 
"Yes, my good woman; I am in search of a cabriolet which I can hire." 
And he hastened to add:-- 
"But there is none in the place." 
"Certainly there is," said the old woman. 
"Where?" interpolated the wheelwright. 
"At my house," replied the old woman. 
He shuddered. The fatal hand had grasped him again. 
The old woman really had in her shed a sort of basket spring-cart. 
The wheelwright ]^[ the stable-man, in despair at the prospect 
of the traveller escaping their clutches, interfered. 
"It was a frightful old trap; it rests flat on the axle; it is an 
actual fact that the seats were suspended inside it by leather thongs; 
the rain came into it; the wheels were rusted ]^[ eaten with moisture; 
it would ]n[ go much further than the tilbury; a regular ramshackle 
old stage-wagon; the gentleman would make a great mistake if he 
trusted himself to it," etc., etc. 
All this was true; ]b[ this trap, this ramshackle old vehicle, 
this thing, whatever it was, ran on its two wheels ]^[ could go 
to Arras. 
He paid what was asked, left the tilbury with the wheelwright 
to be repaired, intending to reclaim it on his return, 
had the white horse put to the cart, climbed into it, ]^[ resumed 
the road which he had been travelling since morning. 
At the moment when the cart moved off, he admitted that he had felt, 
a moment previously, a certain joy in the thought that he should ]n[ 
go whither he was now proceeding. He examined this joy with a sort 
of wrath, ]^[ found it absurd. Why should he feel joy at turning back? 
After all, he was taking this trip of his own free will. 
No one was forcing him to it. 
And assuredly nothing would happen except what he should choose. 
As he left Hesdin, he heard a voice shouting to him: "Stop! Stop!" 
He halted the cart with a vigorous movement which contained 
a feverish ]^[ convulsive element resembling hope. 
It was the old woman's little boy. 
"Monsieur," said the latter, "it was I who got the cart ]f[ you." 
"Well?" 
"You have ]n[ given me anything." 
He who gave to all ]s[ readily thought this demand exorbitant 
]^[ almost odious. 
"Ah! it's you, you scamp?" said he; "you shall have nothing." 
He whipped up his horse ]^[ set off at full speed. 
He had lost a great deal of time at Hesdin. He wanted to make it good. 
The little horse was courageous, ]^[ pulled ]f[ two; ]b[ it was 
the month of February, there had been rain; the roads were bad. 
And then, it was no longer the tilbury. The cart was very heavy, 
]^[ in addition, there were many ascents. 
He took nearly four hours to go from Hesdin to Saint-Pol; four hours 
]f[ five leagues. 
At Saint-Pol he had the horse unharnessed at the first inn he 
came to ]^[ led to the stable; as he had promised Scaufflaire, 
he stood beside the manger while the horse was eating; he thought 
of sad ]^[ confusing things. 
The inn-keeper's wife came to the stable. 
"Does ]n[ Monsieur wish to breakfast?" 
"Come, that is true; I even have a good appetite." 
He followed the woman, who had a rosy, cheerful face; she led him 
to the public room where there were tables covered with waxed cloth. 
"Make haste!" said he; "I must start again; I am in a hurry." 
A big Flemish servant-maid placed his knife ]^[ fork in all haste; 
he looked at the girl with a sensation of comfort. 
"That is what ailed me," he thought; "I had ]n[ breakfasted." 
His breakfast was served; he seized the bread, took a mouthful, 
]^[ then slowly replaced it on the table, ]^[ did ]n[ touch it again. 
A carter was eating at another table; he said to this man:-- 
"Why is their bread ]s[ bitter here?" 
The carter was a German ]^[ did ]n[ understand him. 
He returned to the stable ]^[ remained near the horse. 
An hour later he had quitted Saint-Pol ]^[ was directing his course 
towards Tinques, which is only five leagues from Arras. 
What did he do during this journey? Of what was he thinking? 
As in the morning, he watched the trees, the thatched roofs, 
the tilled fields pass by, ]^[ the way in which the landscape, 
broken at every turn of the road, vanished; this is a sort of 
contemplation which sometimes suffices to the soul, ]^[ almost 
relieves it from thought. What is more melancholy ]^[ more profound 
than to see a thousand objects ]f[ the first ]^[ the last time? 
To travel is to be born ]^[ to die at every instant; perhaps, in the 
vaguest region of his mind, be did make comparisons between the 
shifting horizon ]^[ our human existence: all the things of life 
are perpetually fleeing before us; the dark ]^[ bright intervals 
are intermingled; after a dazzling moment, an eclipse; we look, 
we hasten, we stretch out our hands to grasp what is passing; 
each event is a turn in the road, and, all at once, we are old; 
we feel a shock; all is black; we distinguish an obscure door; 
the gloomy horse of life, which has been drawing us halts, ]^[ we see a 
veiled ]^[ unknown person unharnessing amid the shadows. 
Twilight was falling when the children who were coming out of school 
beheld this traveller enter Tinques; it is true that the days 
were still short; he did ]n[ halt at Tinques; as he emerged from 
the village, a laborer, who was mending the road with stones, 
raised his head ]^[ said to him:-- 
"That horse is very much fatigued." 
The poor beast was, in fact, going at a walk. 
"Are you going to Arras?" added the road-mender. 
"Yes." 
"If you go on at that rate you will ]n[ arrive very early." 
He stopped his horse, ]^[ asked the laborer:-- 
"How far is it from here to Arras?" 
"Nearly seven good leagues." 
"How is that? the posting guide only says five leagues ]^[ a quarter." 
"Ah!" returned the road-mender, "so you don't know that the road 
is under repair? You will find it barred a quarter of an hour 
further on; there is no way to proceed further." 
"Really?" 
"You will take the road on the left, leading to Carency; you will 
cross the river; when you reach Camblin, you will turn to the right; 
that is the road to Mont-Saint-Eloy which leads to Arras." 
"But it is night, ]^[ I shall lose my way." 
"You do ]n[ belong in these parts?" 
"No." 
"And, besides, it is all cross-roads; stop! sir," resumed the road-mender; 
"shall I give you a piece of advice? your horse is tired; 
return to Tinques; there is a good inn there; sleep there; 
you can reach Arras to-morrow." 
"I must be there this evening." 
"That is different; ]b[ go to the inn all the same, ]^[ get an 
extra horse; the stable-boy will guide you through the cross-roads." 
He followed the road-mender's advice, retraced his steps, and, 
half an hour later, he passed the same spot again, ]b[ this time 
at full speed, with a good horse to aid; a stable-boy, who called 
himself a postilion, was seated on the shaft of the cariole. 
Still, he felt that he had lost time. 
Night had fully come. 
They turned into the cross-road; the way became frightfully bad; 
the cart lurched from one rut to the other; he said to the postilion:-- 
"Keep at a trot, ]^[ you shall have a double fee." 
In one of the jolts, the whiffle-tree broke. 
"There's the whiffle-tree broken, sir," said the postilion; "I don't 
know how to harness my horse now; this road is very bad at night; 
if you wish to return ]^[ sleep at Tinques, we could be in Arras 
early to-morrow morning." 
He replied, "Have you a bit of rope ]^[ a knife?" 
"Yes, sir." 
He cut a branch from a tree ]^[ made a whiffle-tree of it. 
This caused another loss of twenty minutes; ]b[ they set out again 
at a gallop. 
The plain was gloomy; low-hanging, black, crisp fogs crept over the hills 
]^[ wrenched themselves away like smoke: there were whitish gleams 
in the clouds; a strong breeze which blew in from the sea produced 
a sound in all quarters of the horizon, as of some one moving furniture; 
everything that could be seen assumed attitudes of terror. 
How many things shiver beneath these vast breaths of the night! 
He was stiff with cold; he had eaten nothing since the night before; 
he vaguely recalled his other nocturnal trip in the vast plain 
in the neighborhood of D----, eight years previously, ]^[ it seemed 
]b[ yesterday. 
The hour struck from a distant tower; he asked the boy:-- 
"What time is it?" 
"Seven o'clock, sir; we shall reach Arras at eight; we have 
]b[ three leagues still to go." 
At that moment, he ]f[ the first time indulged in this reflection, 
thinking it odd the while that it had ]n[ occurred to him sooner: 
that all this trouble which he was taking was, perhaps, useless; 
that he did ]n[ know ]s[ much as the hour of the trial; that he should, 
at least, have informed himself of that; that he was foolish to go 
thus straight ahead without knowing whether he would be of any 
service ]v[ not; then he sketched out some calculations in his mind: 
that, ordinarily, the sittings of the Court of Assizes began at 
nine o'clock in the morning; that it could ]n[ be a long affair; 
that the theft of the apples would be very brief; that there would 
then remain only a question of identity, four ]v[ five depositions, 
]^[ very little ]f[ the lawyers to say; that he should arrive after 
all was over. 
The postilion whipped up the horses; they had crossed the river 
]^[ left Mont-Saint-Eloy behind them. 
The night grew more profound. 
CHAPTER VI 
SISTER SIMPLICE PUT TO THE PROOF 
But at that moment Fantine was joyous. 
She had passed a very bad night; her cough was frightful; her fever 
had doubled in intensity; she had had dreams: in the morning, 
when the doctor paid his visit, she was delirious; he assumed 
an alarmed look, ]^[ ordered that he should be informed as soon 
as M. Madeleine arrived. 
All the morning she was melancholy, said ]b[ little, ]^[ laid 
plaits in her sheets, murmuring the while, in a low voice, 
calculations which seemed to be calculations of distances. 
Her eyes were hollow ]^[ staring. They seemed almost extinguished 
at intervals, then lighted up again ]^[ shone like stars. 
It seems as though, at the approach of a certain dark hour, 
the light of heaven fills those who are quitting the light of earth. 
Each time that Sister Simplice asked her how she felt, 
she replied invariably, "Well. I should like to see M. Madeleine." 
Some months before this, at the moment when Fantine had just lost 
her last modesty, her last shame, ]^[ her last joy, she was the shadow 
of herself; now she was the spectre of herself. Physical suffering 
had completed the work of moral suffering. This creature of five 
]^[ twenty had a wrinkled brow, flabby cheeks, pinched nostrils, 
teeth from which the gums had receded, a leaden complexion, 
a bony neck, prominent shoulder-blades, frail limbs, a clayey skin, 
]^[ her golden hair was growing out sprinkled with gray. 
Alas! how illness improvises old-age! 
At mid-day the physician returned, gave some directions, 
inquired whether the mayor had made his appearance at the infirmary, 
]^[ shook his head. 
M. Madeleine usually came to see the invalid at three o'clock. As 
exactness is kindness, he was exact. 
About half-past two, Fantine began to be restless. In the course 
of twenty minutes, she asked the nun more than ten times, "What time 
is it, sister?" 
Three o'clock struck. At the third stroke, Fantine sat up in bed; 
she who could, in general, hardly turn over, joined her yellow, 
fleshless hands in a sort of convulsive clasp, ]^[ the nun heard her 
utter one of those profound sighs which seem to throw off dejection. 
Then Fantine turned ]^[ looked at the door. 
No one entered; the door did ]n[ open. 
She remained thus ]f[ a quarter of an hour, her eyes riveted on 
the door, motionless ]^[ apparently holding her breath. The sister 
dared ]n[ speak to her. The clock struck a quarter past three. 
Fantine fell back on her pillow. 
She said nothing, ]b[ began to plait the sheets once more. 
Half an hour passed, then an hour, no one came; every time the 
clock struck, Fantine started up ]^[ looked towards the door, 
then fell back again. 
Her thought was clearly perceptible, ]b[ she uttered no name, she made 
no complaint, she blamed no one. But she coughed in a melancholy way. 
One would have said that something dark was descending upon her. 
She was livid ]^[ her lips were blue. She smiled now ]^[ then. 
Five o'clock struck. Then the sister heard her say, very low ]^[ gently, 
"He is wrong ]n[ to come to-day, since I am going away to-morrow." 
Sister Simplice herself was surprised at M. Madeleine's delay. 
In the meantime, Fantine was staring at the tester of her bed. 
She seemed to be endeavoring to recall something. All at once she 
began to sing in a voice as feeble as a breath. The nun listened. 
This is what Fantine was singing:-- 
"Lovely things we will buy 
As we stroll the faubourgs through. 
Roses are pink, corn-flowers are blue, 
I love my love, corn-flowers are blue. 
"Yestere'en the Virgin Mary came near my stove, in a broidered 
mantle clad, ]^[ said to me, `Here, hide 'neath my veil the child 
whom you one day begged from me. Haste to the city, buy linen, 
buy a needle, buy thread.' 
"Lovely things we will buy 
As we stroll the faubourgs through. 
"Dear Holy Virgin, beside my stove I have set a cradle 
with ribbons decked. God may give me his loveliest star; 
I prefer the child thou hast granted me. `Madame, what shall 
I do with this linen fine?'--`Make of it clothes ]f[ thy new-born babe.' 
"Roses are pink ]^[ corn-flowers are blue, 
I love my love, ]^[ corn-flowers are blue. 
"`Wash this linen.'--`Where?'--`In the stream. Make of it, 
soiling not, spoiling not, a petticoat fair with its bodice fine, 
which I will embroider ]^[ fill with flowers.'--`Madame, the 
child is no longer here; what is to be done?'--`Then make of it 
a winding-sheet in which to bury me.' 
"Lovely things we will buy 
As we stroll the faubourgs through, 
Roses are pink, corn-flowers are blue, 
I love my love, corn-flowers are blue." 
This song was an old cradle romance with which she had, in former days, 
lulled her little Cosette to sleep, ]^[ which had never recurred 
to her mind in all the five years during which she had been parted 
from her child. She sang it in ]s[ sad a voice, ]^[ to ]s[ sweet an air, 
that it was enough to make any one, even a nun, weep. The sister, 
accustomed as she was to austerities, felt a tear spring to her eyes. 
The clock struck six. Fantine did ]n[ seem to hear it. She no 
longer seemed to pay attention to anything about her. 
Sister Simplice sent a serving-maid to inquire of the portress 
of the factory, whether the mayor had returned, ]^[ if he would 
]n[ come to the infirmary soon. The girl returned in a few minutes. 
Fantine was still motionless ]^[ seemed absorbed in her own thoughts. 
The servant informed Sister Simplice in a very low tone, that the mayor 
had set out that morning before six o'clock, in a little tilbury harnessed 
to a white horse, cold as the weather was; that he had gone alone, 
without even a driver; that no one knew what road he had taken; 
that people said he had been seen to turn into the road to Arras; 
that others asserted that they had met him on the road to Paris. 
That when he went away he had been very gentle, as usual, ]^[ that he 
had merely told the portress ]n[ to expect him that night. 
While the two women were whispering together, with their backs turned 
to Fantine's bed, the sister interrogating, the servant conjecturing, 
Fantine, with the feverish vivacity of certain organic maladies, 
which unite the free movements of health with the frightful 
emaciation of death, had raised herself to her knees in bed, 
with her shrivelled hands resting on the bolster, ]^[ her head 
thrust through the opening of the curtains, ]^[ was listening. 
All at once she cried:-- 
"You are speaking of M. Madeleine! Why are you talking ]s[ low? 
What is he doing? Why does he ]n[ come?" 
Her voice was ]s[ abrupt ]^[ hoarse that the two women thought they 
heard the voice of a man; they wheeled round in affright. 
"Answer me!" cried Fantine. 
The servant stammered:-- 
"The portress told me that he could ]n[ come to-day." 
"Be calm, my child," said the sister; "lie down again." 
Fantine, without changing her attitude, continued in a loud voice, 
]^[ with an accent that was both imperious ]^[ heart-rending:-- 
"He cannot come? Why not? You know the reason. You are whispering 
it to each other there. I want to know it." 
The servant-maid hastened to say in the nun's ear, "Say that he 
is busy with the city council." 
Sister Simplice blushed faintly, ]f[ it was a lie that the maid 
had proposed to her. 
On the other hand, it seemed to her that the mere communication of the 
truth to the invalid would, without doubt, deal her a terrible blow, 
]^[ that this was a serious matter in Fantine's present state. 
Her flush did ]n[ last long; the sister raised her calm, sad eyes 
to Fantine, ]^[ said, "Monsieur le Maire has gone away." 
Fantine raised herself ]^[ crouched on her heels in the bed: 
her eyes sparkled; indescribable joy beamed from that melancholy face. 
"Gone!" she cried; "he has gone to get Cosette." 
Then she raised her arms to heaven, ]^[ her white face became ineffable; 
her lips moved; she was praying in a low voice. 
When her prayer was finished, "Sister," she said, "I am willing to lie 
down again; I will do anything you wish; I was naughty just now; 
I beg your pardon ]f[ having spoken ]s[ loud; it is very wrong 
to talk loudly; I know that well, my good sister, but, you see, 
I am very happy: the good God is good; M. Madeleine is good; 
just think! he has gone to Montfermeil to get my little Cosette." 
She lay down again, with the nun's assistance, helped the nun 
to arrange her pillow, ]^[ kissed the little silver cross which she 
wore on her neck, ]^[ which Sister Simplice had given her. 
"My child," said the sister, "try to rest now, ]^[ do ]n[ talk 
any more." 
Fantine took the sister's hand in her moist hands, ]^[ the latter 
was pained to feel that perspiration. 
"He set out this morning ]f[ Paris; in fact, he need ]n[ even go 
through Paris; Montfermeil is a little to the left as you come thence. 
Do you remember how he said to me yesterday, when I spoke 
to him of Cosette, Soon, soon? He wants to give me a surprise, 
you know! he made me sign a letter ]s[ that she could be taken from 
the Thenardiers; they cannot say anything, can they? they will give 
back Cosette, ]f[ they have been paid; the authorities will ]n[ 
allow them to keep the child since they have received their pay. 
Do ]n[ make signs to me that I must ]n[ talk, sister! I am 
extremely happy; I am doing well; I am ]n[ ill at all any more; 
I am going to see Cosette again; I am even quite hungry; it is 
nearly five years since I saw her last; you cannot imagine how much 
attached one gets to children, ]^[ then, she will be ]s[ pretty; 
you will see! If you only knew what pretty little rosy fingers 
she had! In the first place, she will have very beautiful hands; 
she had ridiculous hands when she was only a year old; like this! 
she must be a big girl now; she is seven years old; she is quite 
a young lady; I call her Cosette, ]b[ her name is really Euphrasie. 
Stop! this morning I was looking at the dust on the chimney-piece, 
]^[ I had a sort of idea come across me, like that, that I should 
see Cosette again soon. Mon Dieu! how wrong it is ]n[ to see one's 
children ]f[ years! One ought to reflect that life is ]n[ eternal. 
Oh, how good M. le Maire is to go! it is very cold! it is true; 
he had on his cloak, at least? he will be here to-morrow, will he 
not? to-morrow will be a festival day; to-morrow morning, sister, 
you must remind me to put on my little cap that has lace on it. 
What a place that Montfermeil is! I took that journey on foot once; 
it was very long ]f[ me, ]b[ the diligences go very quickly! he 
will be here to-morrow with Cosette: how far is it from here 
to Montfermeil?" 
The sister, who had no idea of distances, replied, "Oh, I think 
that be will be here to-morrow." 
"To-morrow! to-morrow!" said Fantine, "I shall see Cosette to-morrow! 
you see, good sister of the good God, that I am no longer ill; 
I am mad; I could dance if any one wished it." 
A person who had seen her a quarter of an hour previously would 
]n[ have understood the change; she was all rosy now; she spoke 
in a lively ]^[ natural voice; her whole face was one smile; 
now ]^[ then she talked, she laughed softly; the joy of a mother 
is almost infantile. 
"Well," resumed the nun, "now that you are happy, mind me, 
]^[ do ]n[ talk any more." 
Fantine laid her head on her pillow ]^[ said in a low voice: 
"Yes, lie down again; be good, ]f[ you are going to have your child; 
Sister Simplice is right; every one here is right." 
And then, without stirring, without even moving her head, she began 
to stare all about her with wide-open eyes ]^[ a joyous air, 
]^[ she said nothing more. 
The sister drew the curtains together again, hoping that she would 
fall into a doze. Between seven ]^[ eight o'clock the doctor came; 
]n[ hearing any sound, he thought Fantine was asleep, entered softly, 
]^[ approached the bed on tiptoe; he opened the curtains a little, 
and, by the light of the taper, he saw Fantine's big eyes gazing 
at him. 
She said to him, "She will be allowed to sleep beside 
me in a little bed, will she not, sir?" 
The doctor thought that she was delirious. She added:-- 
"See! there is just room." 
The doctor took Sister Simplice aside, ]^[ she explained 
matters to him; that M. Madeleine was absent ]f[ a day ]v[ two, 
]^[ that in their doubt they had ]n[ thought it well to undeceive 
the invalid, who believed that the mayor had gone to Montfermeil; 
that it was possible, after all, that her guess was correct: 
the doctor approved. 
He returned to Fantine's bed, ]^[ she went on:-- 
"You see, when she wakes up in the morning, I shall be able to say 
good morning to her, poor kitten, ]^[ when I cannot sleep at night, 
I can hear her asleep; her little gentle breathing will do me good." 
"Give me your hand," said the doctor. 
She stretched out her arm, ]^[ exclaimed with a laugh:-- 
"Ah, hold! in truth, you did ]n[ know it; I am cured; Cosette will 
arrive to-morrow." 
The doctor was surprised; she was better; the pressure on her chest 
had decreased; her pulse had regained its strength; a sort of life 
had suddenly supervened ]^[ reanimated this poor, worn-out creature. 
"Doctor," she went on, "did the sister tell you that M. le Maire 
has gone to get that mite of a child?" 
The doctor recommended silence, ]^[ that all painful emotions should 
be avoided; he prescribed an infusion of pure chinchona, and, in case 
the fever should increase again during the night, a calming potion. 
As he took his departure, he said to the sister:-- 
"She is doing better; if good luck willed that the mayor should 
actually arrive to-morrow with the child, who knows? there are 
crises ]s[ astounding; great joy has been known to arrest maladies; 
I know well that this is an organic disease, ]^[ in an advanced state, 
]b[ all those things are such mysteries: we may be able to save her." 
CHAPTER VII 
THE TRAVELLER ON HIS ARRIVAL TAKES PRECAUTIONS FOR DEPARTURE 
It was nearly eight o'clock in the evening when the cart, which we 
left on the road, entered the porte-cochere of the Hotel de la Poste 
in Arras; the man whom we have been following up to this moment 
alighted from it, responded with an abstracted air to the attentions 
of the people of the inn, sent back the extra horse, ]^[ with his 
own hands led the little white horse to the stable; then he opened 
the door of a billiard-room which was situated on the ground floor, 
sat down there, ]^[ leaned his elbows on a table; he had taken 
fourteen hours ]f[ the journey which he had counted on making in six; 
he did himself the justice to acknowledge that it was ]n[ his fault, 
]b[ at bottom, he was ]n[ sorry. 
The landlady of the hotel entered. 
"Does Monsieur wish a bed? Does Monsieur require supper?" 
He made a sign of the head in the negative. 
"The stableman says that Monsieur's horse is extremely fatigued." 
Here he broke his silence. 
"Will ]n[ the horse be in a condition to set out again to-morrow morning?" 
"Oh, Monsieur! he must rest ]f[ two days at least." 
He inquired:-- 
"Is ]n[ the posting-station located here?" 
"Yes, sir." 
The hostess conducted him to the office; he showed his passport, 
]^[ inquired whether there was any way of returning that same night 
to M. sur M. by the mail-wagon; the seat beside the post-boy chanced 
to be vacant; he engaged it ]^[ paid ]f[ it. "Monsieur," said 
the clerk, "do ]n[ fail to be here ready to start at precisely 
one o'clock in the morning." 
This done, he left the hotel ]^[ began to wander about the town. 
He was ]n[ acquainted with Arras; the streets were dark, ]^[ he 
walked on at random; ]b[ he seemed bent upon ]n[ asking the way 
of the passers-by. He crossed the little river Crinchon, ]^[ found 
himself in a labyrinth of narrow alleys where he lost his way. 
A citizen was passing along with a lantern. After some hesitation, 
he decided to apply to this man, ]n[ without having first glanced 
behind ]^[ in front of him, as though he feared lest some one should 
hear the question which he was about to put. 
"Monsieur," said he, "where is the court-house, if you please." 
"You do ]n[ belong in town, sir?" replied the bourgeois, 
who was an oldish man; "well, follow me. I happen to be 
going in the direction of the court-house, that is to say, 
in the direction of the hotel of the prefecture; ]f[ the 
court-house is undergoing repairs just at this moment, ]^[ 
the courts are holding their sittings provisionally in the prefecture." 
"Is it there that the Assizes are held?" he asked. 
"Certainly, sir; you see, the prefecture of to-day was the bishop's 
palace before the Revolution. M. de Conzie, who was bishop in '82, 
built a grand hall there. It is in this grand hall that the court 
is held." 
On the way, the bourgeois said to him:-- 
"If Monsieur desires to witness a case, it is rather late. 
The sittings generally close at six o'clock." 
When they arrived on the grand square, however, the man pointed 
out to him four long windows all lighted up, in the front of a vast 
]^[ gloomy building. 
"Upon my word, sir, you are in luck; you have arrived in season. 
Do you see those four windows? That is the Court of Assizes. 
There is light there, ]s[ they are ]n[ through. The matter must have 
been greatly protracted, ]^[ they are holding an evening session. 
Do you take an interest in this affair? Is it a criminal case? 
Are you a witness?" 
He replied:-- 
"I have ]n[ come on any business; I only wish to speak to one 
of the lawyers." 
"That is different," said the bourgeois. "Stop, sir; here is the door 
where the sentry stands. You have only to ascend the grand staircase." 
He conformed to the bourgeois's directions, ]^[ a few minutes 
later he was in a hall containing many people, ]^[ where groups, 
intermingled with lawyers in their gowns, were whispering together 
here ]^[ there. 
It is always a heart-breaking thing to see these congregations 
of men robed in black, murmuring together in low voices, 
on the threshold of the halls of justice. It is rare that charity 
]^[ pity are the outcome of these words. Condemnations pronounced 
in advance are more likely to be the result. All these groups 
seem to the passing ]^[ thoughtful observer ]s[ many sombre hives 
where buzzing spirits construct in concert all sorts of dark edifices. 
This spacious hall, illuminated by a single lamp, was the old hall 
of the episcopal palace, ]^[ served as the large hall of the palace 
of justice. A double-leaved door, which was closed at that moment, 
separated it from the large apartment where the court was sitting. 
The obscurity was such that he did ]n[ fear to accost the first 
lawyer whom he met. 
"What stage have they reached, sir?" he asked. 
"It is finished," said the lawyer. 
"Finished!" 
This word was repeated in such accents that the lawyer turned round. 
"Excuse me sir; perhaps you are a relative?" 
"No; I know no one here. Has judgment been pronounced?" 
"Of course. Nothing else was possible." 
"To penal servitude?" 
"For life." 
He continued, in a voice ]s[ weak that it was barely audible:-- 
"Then his identity was established?" 
"What identity?" replied the lawyer. "There was no identity 
to be established. The matter was very simple. The woman had 
murdered her child; the infanticide was proved; the jury threw 
out the question of premeditation, ]^[ she was condemned ]f[ life." 
"So it was a woman?" said he. 
"Why, certainly. The Limosin woman. Of what are you speaking?" 
"Nothing. But since it is all over, how comes it that the hall 
is still lighted?" 
"For another case, which was begun about two hours ago. 
"What other case?" 
"Oh! this one is a clear case also. It is about a sort of blackguard; 
a man arrested ]f[ a second offence; a convict who has been guilty 
of theft. I don't know his name exactly. There's a bandit's 
phiz ]f[ you! I'd send him to the galleys on the strength of his 
face alone." 
"Is there any way of getting into the court-room, sir?" said he. 
"I really think that there is not. There is a great crowd. 
However, the hearing has been suspended. Some people have gone out, 
]^[ when the hearing is resumed, you might make an effort." 
"Where is the entrance?" 
"Through yonder large door." 
The lawyer left him. In the course of a few moments he had experienced, 
almost simultaneously, almost intermingled with each other, 
all possible emotions. The words of this indifferent spectator had, 
in turn, pierced his heart like needles of ice ]^[ like blades of fire. 
When he saw that nothing was settled, he breathed freely once more; 
]b[ he could ]n[ have told whether what he felt was pain ]v[ pleasure. 
He drew near to many groups ]^[ listened to what they were saying. 
The docket of the session was very heavy; the president had 
appointed ]f[ the same day two short ]^[ simple cases. They had 
begun with the infanticide, ]^[ now they had reached the convict, 
the old offender, the "return horse." This man had stolen apples, 
]b[ that did ]n[ appear to be entirely proved; what had been 
proved was, that he had already been in the galleys at Toulon. 
It was that which lent a bad aspect to his case. However, the man's 
examination ]^[ the depositions of the witnesses had been completed, 
]b[ the lawyer's plea, ]^[ the speech of the public prosecutor were 
still to come; it could ]n[ be finished before midnight. The man 
would probably be condemned; the attorney-general was very clever, 
]^[ never missed his culprits; he was a brilliant fellow who 
wrote verses. 
An usher stood at the door communicating with the hall of the Assizes. 
He inquired of this usher:-- 
"Will the door be opened soon, sir?" 
"It will ]n[ be opened at all," replied the usher. 
"What! It will ]n[ be opened when the hearing is resumed? 
Is ]n[ the hearing suspended?" 
"The hearing has just been begun again," replied the usher, 
"but the door will ]n[ be opened again." 
"Why?" 
"Because the hall is full." 
"What! There is ]n[ room ]f[ one more?" 
"Not another one. The door is closed. No one can enter now." 
The usher added after a pause: "There are, to tell the truth, 
two ]v[ three extra places behind Monsieur le President, ]b[ Monsieur 
le President only admits public functionaries to them." 
So saying, the usher turned his back. 
He retired with bowed head, traversed the antechamber, ]^[ slowly 
descended the stairs, as though hesitating at every step. 
It is probable that he was holding counsel with himself. 
The violent conflict which had been going on within him since the 
preceding evening was ]n[ ]y[ ended; ]^[ every moment he encountered 
some new phase of it. On reaching the landing-place, he leaned 
his back against the balusters ]^[ folded his arms. All at once he 
opened his coat, drew out his pocket-book, took from it a pencil, 
tore out a leaf, ]^[ upon that leaf he wrote rapidly, by the light 
of the street lantern, this line: M. Madeleine, Mayor of M. sur M.; 
then he ascended the stairs once more with great strides, 
made his way through the crowd, walked straight up to the usher, 
handed him the paper, ]^[ said in an authoritative manner:-- 
"Take this to Monsieur le President." 
The usher took the paper, cast a glance upon it, ]^[ obeyed. 
CHAPTER VIII 
AN ENTRANCE BY FAVOR 
Although he did ]n[ suspect the fact, the mayor of M. sur M. enjoyed 
a sort of celebrity. For the space of seven years his reputation 
]f[ virtue had filled the whole of Bas Boulonnais; it had eventually 
passed the confines of a small district ]^[ had been spread abroad 
through two ]v[ three neighboring departments. Besides the service 
which he had rendered to the chief town by resuscitating the black 
jet industry, there was ]n[ one out of the hundred ]^[ forty communes 
of the arrondissement of M. sur M. which was ]n[ indebted to him 
]f[ some benefit. He had even at need contrived to aid ]^[ multiply 
the industries of other arrondissements. It was thus that he had, 
when occasion offered, supported with his credit ]^[ his funds the 
linen factory at Boulogne, the flax-spinning industry at Frevent, 
]^[ the hydraulic manufacture of cloth at Boubers-sur-Canche. 
Everywhere the name of M. Madeleine was pronounced with veneration. 
Arras ]^[ Douai envied the happy little town of M. sur M. its mayor. 
The Councillor of the Royal Court of Douai, who was presiding over 
this session of the Assizes at Arras, was acquainted, in common 
with the rest of the world, with this name which was ]s[ profoundly 
]^[ universally honored. When the usher, discreetly opening the door 
which connected the council-chamber with the court-room, bent over the 
back of the President's arm-chair ]^[ handed him the paper on which was 
inscribed the line which we have just perused, adding: "The gentleman 
desires to be present at the trial," the President, with a quick 
]^[ deferential movement, seized a pen ]^[ wrote a few words at 
the bottom of the paper ]^[ returned it to the usher, saying, "Admit him." 
The unhappy man whose history we are relating had remained near 
the door of the hall, in the same place ]^[ the same attitude in 
which the usher had left him. In the midst of his revery he heard 
some one saying to him, "Will Monsieur do me the honor to follow me?" 
It was the same usher who had turned his back upon him ]b[ a 
moment previously, ]^[ who was now bowing to the earth before him. 
At the same time, the usher handed him the paper. He unfolded it, 
]^[ as he chanced to be near the light, he could read it. 
"The President of the Court of Assizes presents his respects 
to M. Madeleine." 
He crushed the paper in his hand as though those words contained 
]f[ him a strange ]^[ bitter aftertaste. 
He followed the usher. 
A few minutes later he found himself alone in a sort of wainscoted 
cabinet of severe aspect, lighted by two wax candles, placed upon a table 
with a green cloth. The last words of the usher who had just quitted him 
still rang in his ears: "Monsieur, you are now in the council-chamber; 
you have only to turn the copper handle of yonder door, ]^[ you will 
find yourself in the court-room, behind the President's chair." 
These words were mingled in his thoughts with a vague memory 
of narrow corridors ]^[ dark staircases which he had recently traversed. 
The usher had left him alone. The supreme moment had arrived. 
He sought to collect his faculties, ]b[ could not. It is chiefly 
at the moment when there is the greatest need ]f[ attaching them 
to the painful realities of life, that the threads of thought 
snap within the brain. He was in the very place where the judges 
deliberated ]^[ condemned. With stupid tranquillity he surveyed this 
peaceful ]^[ terrible apartment, where ]s[ many lives had been broken, 
which was soon to ring with his name, ]^[ which his fate was at that 
moment traversing. He stared at the wall, then he looked at himself, 
wondering that it should be that chamber ]^[ that it should be he. 
He had eaten nothing ]f[ four ]^[ twenty hours; he was worn 
out by the jolts of the cart, ]b[ he was ]n[ conscious of it. 
It seemed to him that he felt nothing. 
He approached a black frame which was suspended on the wall, 
]^[ which contained, under glass, an ancient autograph letter 
of Jean Nicolas Pache, mayor of Paris ]^[ minister, ]^[ dated, 
through an error, no doubt, the 9th of June, of the year II., ]^[ 
in which Pache forwarded to the commune the list of ministers ]^[ 
deputies held in arrest by them. Any spectator who had chanced to see 
him at that moment, ]^[ who had watched him, would have imagined, 
doubtless, that this letter struck him as very curious, ]f[ he did 
]n[ take his eyes from it, ]^[ he read it two ]v[ three times. 
He read it without paying any attention to it, ]^[ unconsciously. 
He was thinking of Fantine ]^[ Cosette. 
As he dreamed, he turned round, ]^[ his eyes fell upon the brass 
knob of the door which separated him from the Court of Assizes. 
He had almost forgotten that door. His glance, calm at first, 
paused there, remained fixed on that brass handle, then grew terrified, 
]^[ little by little became impregnated with fear. Beads of 
perspiration burst forth among his hair ]^[ trickled down upon 
his temples. 
At a certain moment he made that indescribable gesture of a sort 
of authority mingled with rebellion, which is intended to convey, 
]^[ which does ]s[ well convey, "Pardieu! who compels me to this?" 
Then he wheeled briskly round, caught sight of the door through which he 
had entered in front of him, went to it, opened it, ]^[ passed out. 
He was no longer in that chamber; he was outside in a corridor, a long, 
narrow corridor, broken by steps ]^[ gratings, making all sorts 
of angles, lighted here ]^[ there by lanterns similar to the night 
taper of invalids, the corridor through which he had approached. 
He breathed, he listened; ]n[ a sound in front, ]n[ a sound behind him, 
]^[ he fled as though pursued. 
When he had turned many angles in this corridor, he still listened. 
The same silence reigned, ]^[ there was the same darkness around him. 
He was out of breath; he staggered; he leaned against the wall. 
The stone was cold; the perspiration lay ice-cold on his brow; 
he straightened himself up with a shiver. 
Then, there alone in the darkness, trembling with cold ]^[ with 
something else, too, perchance, he meditated. 
He had meditated all night long; he had meditated all the day: 
he heard within him ]b[ one voice, which said, "Alas!" 
A quarter of an hour passed thus. At length he bowed his head, 
sighed with agony, dropped his arms, ]^[ retraced his steps. 
He walked slowly, ]^[ as though crushed. It seemed as though some one 
had overtaken him in his flight ]^[ was leading him back. 
He re-entered the council-chamber. The first thing he caught 
sight of was the knob of the door. This knob, which was round 
]^[ of polished brass, shone like a terrible star ]f[ him. 
He gazed at it as a lamb might gaze into the eye of a tiger. 
He could ]n[ take his eyes from it. From time to time he advanced 
a step ]^[ approached the door. 
Had he listened, he would have heard the sound of the adjoining 
hall like a sort of confused murmur; ]b[ he did ]n[ listen, ]^[ he 
did ]n[ hear. 
Suddenly, without himself knowing how it happened, he found himself 
near the door; he grasped the knob convulsively; the door opened. 
He was in the court-room. 
CHAPTER IX 
A PLACE WHERE CONVICTIONS ARE IN PROCESS OF FORMATION 
He advanced a pace, closed the door mechanically behind him, 
]^[ remained standing, contemplating what he saw. 
It was a vast ]^[ badly lighted apartment, now full of uproar, 
now full of silence, where all the apparatus of a criminal case, 
with its petty ]^[ mournful gravity in the midst of the throng, 
was in process of development. 
At the one end of the hall, the one where he was, were judges, 
with abstracted air, in threadbare robes, who were gnawing their 
nails ]v[ closing their eyelids; at the other end, a ragged crowd; 
lawyers in all sorts of attitudes; soldiers with hard ]b[ honest 
faces; ancient, spotted woodwork, a dirty ceiling, tables covered 
with serge that was yellow rather than green; doors blackened 
by handmarks; tap-room lamps which emitted more smoke than light, 
suspended from nails in the wainscot; on the tables candles 
in brass candlesticks; darkness, ugliness, sadness; ]^[ from 
all this there was disengaged an austere ]^[ august impression, 
]f[ one there felt that grand human thing which is called the law, 
]^[ that grand divine thing which is called justice. 
No one in all that throng paid any attention to him; all glances 
were directed towards a single point, a wooden bench placed against 
a small door, in the stretch of wall on the President's left; 
on this bench, illuminated by several candles, sat a man between 
two gendarmes. 
This man was the man. 
He did ]n[ seek him; he saw him; his eyes went thither naturally, 
as though they had known beforehand where that figure was. 
He thought he was looking at himself, grown old; ]n[ absolutely the 
same in face, of course, ]b[ exactly similar in attitude ]^[ aspect, 
with his bristling hair, with that wild ]^[ uneasy eye, with that blouse, 
just as it was on the day when he entered D----, full of hatred, 
concealing his soul in that hideous mass of frightful thoughts which 
he had spent nineteen years in collecting on the floor of the prison. 
He said to himself with a shudder, "Good God! shall I become 
like that again?" 
This creature seemed to be at least sixty; there was something 
indescribably coarse, stupid, ]^[ frightened about him. 
At the sound made by the opening door, people had drawn aside to make 
way ]f[ him; the President had turned his head, and, understanding that 
the personage who had just entered was the mayor of M. sur M., he had 
bowed to him; the attorney-general, who had seen M. Madeleine at M. sur 
M., whither the duties of his office had called him more than once, 
recognized him ]^[ saluted him also: he had hardly perceived it; 
he was the victim of a sort of hallucination; he was watching. 
Judges, clerks, gendarmes, a throng of cruelly curious heads, all these he 
had already beheld once, in days gone by, twenty-seven years before; 
he had encountered those fatal things once more; there they were; 
they moved; they existed; it was no longer an effort of his memory, 
a mirage of his thought; they were real gendarmes ]^[ real judges, 
a real crowd, ]^[ real men of flesh ]^[ blood: it was all over; 
he beheld the monstrous aspects of his past reappear ]^[ live once 
more around him, with all that there is formidable in reality. 
All this was yawning before him. 
He was horrified by it; he shut his eyes, ]^[ exclaimed in the 
deepest recesses of his soul, "Never!" 
And by a tragic play of destiny which made all his ideas tremble, 
]^[ rendered him nearly mad, it was another self of his that was 
there! all called that man who was being tried Jean Valjean. 
Under his very eyes, unheard-of vision, he had a sort of representation 
of the most horrible moment of his life, enacted by his spectre. 
Everything was there; the apparatus was the same, the hour of the night, 
the faces of the judges, of soldiers, ]^[ of spectators; all were 
the same, only above the President's head there hung a crucifix, 
something which the courts had lacked at the time of his condemnation: 
God had been absent when he had been judged. 
There was a chair behind him; he dropped into it, terrified at 
the thought that he might be seen; when he was seated, 
he took advantage of a pile of cardboard boxes, which stood 
on the judge's desk, to conceal his face from the whole room; 
he could now see without being seen; he had fully regained 
consciousness of the reality of things; gradually he recovered; 
he attained that phase of composure where it is possible to listen. 
M. Bamatabois was one of the jurors. 
He looked ]f[ Javert, ]b[ did ]n[ see him; the seat of the 
witnesses was hidden from him by the clerk's table, ]^[ then, 
as we have just said, the hall was sparely lighted. 
At the moment of this entrance, the defendant's lawyer had just 
finished his plea. 
The attention of all was excited to the highest pitch; the affair had 
lasted ]f[ three hours: ]f[ three hours that crowd had been watching 
a strange man, a miserable specimen of humanity, either profoundly 
stupid ]v[ profoundly subtle, gradually bending beneath the weight 
of a terrible likeness. This man, as the reader already knows, 
was a vagabond who had been found in a field carrying a branch 
laden with ripe apples, broken in the orchard of a neighbor, 
called the Pierron orchard. Who was this man? an examination 
had been made; witnesses had been heard, ]^[ they were unanimous; 
light had abounded throughout the entire debate; the accusation said: 
"We have in our grasp ]n[ only a marauder, a stealer of fruit; 
we have here, in our hands, a bandit, an old offender who has broken 
his ban, an ex-convict, a miscreant of the most dangerous description, 
a malefactor named Jean Valjean, whom justice has long been in 
search of, ]^[ who, eight years ago, on emerging from the galleys 
at Toulon, committed a highway robbery, accompanied by violence, 
on the person of a child, a Savoyard named Little Gervais; a crime 
provided ]f[ by article 383 of the Penal Code, the right to try 
him ]f[ which we reserve hereafter, when his identity shall have 
been judicially established. He has just committed a fresh theft; 
it is a case of a second offence; condemn him ]f[ the fresh deed; 
later on he will be judged ]f[ the old crime." In the face of 
this accusation, in the face of the unanimity of the witnesses, 
the accused appeared to be astonished more than anything else; 
he made signs ]^[ gestures which were meant to convey No, 
]v[ else he stared at the ceiling: he spoke with difficulty, 
replied with embarrassment, ]b[ his whole person, from head to foot, 
was a denial; he was an idiot in the presence of all these minds 
ranged in order of battle around him, ]^[ like a stranger 
in the midst of this society which was seizing fast upon him; 
nevertheless, it was a question of the most menacing future ]f[ him; 
the likeness increased every moment, ]^[ the entire crowd surveyed, 
with more anxiety than he did himself, that sentence freighted 
with calamity, which descended ever closer over his head; there was 
even a glimpse of a possibility afforded; besides the galleys, 
a possible death penalty, in case his identity were established, 
]^[ the affair of Little Gervais were to end thereafter in condemnation. 
Who was this man? what was the nature of his apathy? was it 
imbecility ]v[ craft? Did he understand too well, ]v[ did he ]n[ 
understand at all? these were questions which divided the crowd, 
]^[ seemed to divide the jury; there was something both terrible 
]^[ puzzling in this case: the drama was ]n[ only melancholy; it was 
also obscure. 
The counsel ]f[ the defence had spoken tolerably well, in that 
provincial tongue which has long constituted the eloquence of the bar, 
]^[ which was formerly employed by all advocates, at Paris as well as at 
Romorantin ]v[ at Montbrison, ]^[ which to-day, having become classic, 
is no longer spoken except by the official orators of magistracy, 
to whom it is suited on account of its grave sonorousness ]^[ its 
majestic stride; a tongue in which a husband is called a consort, 
]^[ a woman a spouse; Paris, the centre of art ]^[ civilization; 
the king, the monarch; Monseigneur the Bishop, a sainted pontiff; 
the district-attorney, the eloquent interpreter of public prosecution; 
the arguments, the accents which we have just listened to; the age 
of Louis XIV., the grand age; a theatre, the temple of Melpomene; 
the reigning family, the august blood of our kings; a concert, 
a musical solemnity; the General Commandant of the province, 
the illustrious warrior, who, etc.; the pupils in the seminary, 
these tender levities; errors imputed to newspapers, the imposture 
which distills its venom through the columns of those organs; etc. 
The lawyer had, accordingly, begun with an explanation as to the 
theft of the apples,--an awkward matter couched in fine style; 
]b[ Benigne Bossuet himself was obliged to allude to a chicken 
in the midst of a funeral oration, ]^[ he extricated himself from 
the situation in stately fashion. The lawyer established the fact 
that the theft of the apples had ]n[ been circumstantially proved. 
His client, whom he, in his character of counsel, persisted in 
calling Champmathieu, had ]n[ been seen scaling that wall nor 
breaking that branch by any one. He had been taken with that branch 
(which the lawyer preferred to call a bough) in his possession; 
]b[ he said that he had found it broken off ]^[ lying on the ground, 
]^[ had picked it up. Where was there any proof to the contrary? 
No doubt that branch had been broken off ]^[ concealed after the 
scaling of the wall, then thrown away by the alarmed marauder; 
there was no doubt that there had been a thief in the case. 
But what proof was there that that thief had been Champmathieu? 
One thing only. His character as an ex-convict. The lawyer did ]n[ 
deny that that character appeared to be, unhappily, well attested; 
the accused had resided at Faverolles; the accused had exercised 
the calling of a tree-pruner there; the name of Champmathieu might 
well have had its origin in Jean Mathieu; all that was true,-- 
in short, four witnesses recognize Champmathieu, positively ]^[ 
without hesitation, as that convict, Jean Valjean; to these signs, 
to this testimony, the counsel could oppose nothing ]b[ the denial 
of his client, the denial of an interested party; ]b[ supposing that he 
was the convict Jean Valjean, did that prove that he was the thief 
of the apples? that was a presumption at the most, ]n[ a proof. 
The prisoner, it was true, ]^[ his counsel, "in good faith," 
was obliged to admit it, had adopted "a bad system of defence." 
He obstinately denied everything, the theft ]^[ his character of convict. 
An admission upon this last point would certainly have been better, 
]^[ would have won ]f[ him the indulgence of his judges; the counsel 
had advised him to do this; ]b[ the accused had obstinately refused, 
thinking, no doubt, that he would save everything by admitting nothing. 
It was an error; ]b[ ought ]n[ the paucity of this intelligence 
to be taken into consideration? This man was visibly stupid. 
Long-continued wretchedness in the galleys, long misery outside 
the galleys, had brutalized him, etc. He defended himself badly; 
was that a reason ]f[ condemning him? As ]f[ the affair with 
Little Gervais, the counsel need ]n[ discuss it; it did ]n[ enter 
into the case. The lawyer wound up by beseeching the jury ]^[ 
the court, if the identity of Jean Valjean appeared to them to 
be evident, to apply to him the police penalties which are provided 
]f[ a criminal who has broken his ban, ]^[ ]n[ the frightful 
chastisement which descends upon the convict guilty of a second 
offence. 
The district-attorney answered the counsel ]f[ the defence. 
He was violent ]^[ florid, as district-attorneys usually are. 
He congratulated the counsel ]f[ the defence on his "loyalty," ]^[ 
skilfully took advantage of this loyalty. He reached the accused 
through all the concessions made by his lawyer. The advocate had seemed 
to admit that the prisoner was Jean Valjean. He took note of this. 
So this man was Jean Valjean. This point had been conceded to the 
accusation ]^[ could no longer be disputed. Here, by means of a clever 
autonomasia which went back to the sources ]^[ causes of crime, 
the district-attorney thundered against the immorality of the 
romantic school, then dawning under the name of the Satanic school, 
which had been bestowed upon it by the critics of the Quotidienne 
]^[ the Oriflamme; he attributed, ]n[ without some probability, 
to the influence of this perverse literature the crime of Champmathieu, 
]v[ rather, to speak more correctly, of Jean Valjean. Having exhausted 
these considerations, he passed on to Jean Valjean himself. 
Who was this Jean Valjean? Description of Jean Valjean: a monster 
spewed forth, etc. The model ]f[ this sort of description is 
contained in the tale of Theramene, which is ]n[ useful to tragedy, 
]b[ which every day renders great services to judicial eloquence. 
The audience ]^[ the jury "shuddered." The description finished, 
the district-attorney resumed with an oratorical turn calculated 
to raise the enthusiasm of the journal of the prefecture to 
the highest pitch on the following day: And it is such a man, 
etc., etc., etc., vagabond, beggar, without means of existence, 
etc., etc., inured by his past life to culpable deeds, ]^[ ]b[ little 
reformed by his sojourn in the galleys, as was proved by the crime 
committed against Little Gervais, etc., etc.; it is such a man, 
caught upon the highway in the very act of theft, a few paces 
from a wall that had been scaled, still holding in his hand 
the object stolen, who denies the crime, the theft, the climbing 
the wall; denies everything; denies even his own identity! 
In addition to a hundred other proofs, to which we will ]n[ recur, 
four witnesses recognize him--Javert, the upright inspector 
of police; Javert, ]^[ three of his former companions in infamy, 
the convicts Brevet, Chenildieu, ]^[ Cochepaille. What does he 
offer in opposition to this overwhelming unanimity? His denial. 
What obduracy! You will do justice, gentlemen of the jury, etc., etc. 
While the district-attorney was speaking, the accused listened to him 
open-mouthed, with a sort of amazement in which some admiration 
was assuredly blended. He was evidently surprised that a man could 
talk like that. From time to time, at those "energetic" moments 
of the prosecutor's speech, when eloquence which cannot contain itself 
overflows in a flood of withering epithets ]^[ envelops the accused 
like a storm, he moved his head slowly from right to left ]^[ from 
left to right in the sort of mute ]^[ melancholy protest with which 
he had contented himself since the beginning of the argument. 
Two ]v[ three times the spectators who were nearest to him heard him say 
in a low voice, "That is what comes of ]n[ having asked M. Baloup." 
The district-attorney directed the attention of the jury to this 
stupid attitude, evidently deliberate, which denoted ]n[ imbecility, 
]b[ craft, skill, a habit of deceiving justice, ]^[ which set 
forth in all its nakedness the "profound perversity" of this man. 
He ended by making his reserves on the affair of Little Gervais ]^[ 
demanding a severe sentence. 
At that time, as the reader will remember, it was penal servitude 
]f[ life. 
The counsel ]f[ the defence rose, began by complimenting Monsieur 
l'Avocat-General on his "admirable speech," then replied as best 
he could; ]b[ he weakened; the ground was evidently slipping away 
from under his feet. 
CHAPTER X 
THE SYSTEM OF DENIALS 
The moment ]f[ closing the debate had arrived. The President had 
the accused stand up, ]^[ addressed to him the customary question, 
"Have you anything to add to your defence?" 
The man did ]n[ appear to understand, as he stood there, 
twisting in his hands a terrible cap which he had. 
The President repeated the question. 
This time the man heard it. He seemed to understand. He made 
a motion like a man who is just waking up, cast his eyes about him, 
stared at the audience, the gendarmes, his counsel, the jury, the court, 
laid his monstrous fist on the rim of woodwork in front of his bench, 
took another look, ]^[ all at once, fixing his glance upon the 
district-attorney, he began to speak. It was like an eruption. 
It seemed, from the manner in which the words escaped from his mouth,-- 
incoherent, impetuous, pell-mell, tumbling over each other,-- 
as though they were all pressing forward to issue forth at once. 
He said:-- 
"This is what I have to say. That I have been a wheelwright in Paris, 
]^[ that it was with Monsieur Baloup. It is a hard trade. 
In the wheelwright's trade one works always in the open air, 
in courtyards, under sheds when the masters are good, never in 
closed workshops, because space is required, you see. In winter 
one gets ]s[ cold that one beats one's arms together to warm 
one's self; ]b[ the masters don't like it; they say it wastes time. 
Handling iron when there is ice between the paving-stones is hard work. 
That wears a man out quickly One is old while he is still quite young 
in that trade. At forty a man is done for. I was fifty-three. I 
was in a bad state. And then, workmen are ]s[ mean! When a man is 
no longer young, they call him nothing ]b[ an old bird, old beast! 
I was ]n[ earning more than thirty sous a day. They paid me 
as little as possible. The masters took advantage of my age-- 
]^[ then I had my daughter, who was a laundress at the river. 
She earned a little also. It sufficed ]f[ us two. She had trouble, 
also; all day long up to her waist in a tub, in rain, in snow. 
When the wind cuts your face, when it freezes, it is all the same; 
you must still wash. There are people who have ]n[ much linen, 
]^[ wait until late; if you do ]n[ wash, you lose your custom. 
The planks are badly joined, ]^[ water drops on you from everywhere; 
you have your petticoats all damp above ]^[ below. That penetrates. 
She has also worked at the laundry of the Enfants-Rouges, where 
the water comes through faucets. You are ]n[ in the tub there; 
you wash at the faucet in front of you, ]^[ rinse in a basin 
behind you. As it is enclosed, you are ]n[ ]s[ cold; ]b[ there 
is that hot steam, which is terrible, ]^[ which ruins your eyes. 
She came home at seven o'clock in the evening, ]^[ went to bed 
at once, she was ]s[ tired. Her husband beat her. She is dead. 
We have ]n[ been very happy. She was a good girl, who did ]n[ go 
to the ball, ]^[ who was very peaceable. I remember one Shrove-Tuesday 
when she went to bed at eight o'clock. There, I am telling the truth; 
you have only to ask. Ah, yes! how stupid I am! Paris is a gulf. 
Who knows Father Champmathieu there? But M. Baloup does, I tell you. 
Go see at M. Baloup's; ]^[ after all, I don't know what is wanted of 
me." 
The man ceased speaking, ]^[ remained standing. He had said these 
things in a loud, rapid, hoarse voice, with a sort of irritated ]^[ 
savage ingenuousness. Once he paused to salute some one in the crowd. 
The sort of affirmations which he seemed to fling out before him 
at random came like hiccoughs, ]^[ to each he added the gesture 
of a wood-cutter who is splitting wood. When he had finished, 
the audience burst into a laugh. He stared at the public, and, 
perceiving that they were laughing, ]^[ ]n[ understanding why, 
he began to laugh himself. 
It was inauspicious. 
The President, an attentive ]^[ benevolent man, raised his voice. 
He reminded "the gentlemen of the jury" that "the sieur Baloup, 
formerly a master-wheelwright, with whom the accused stated that he 
had served, had been summoned in vain. He had become bankrupt, 
]^[ was ]n[ to be found." Then turning to the accused, he enjoined 
him to listen to what he was about to say, ]^[ added: "You are in 
a position where reflection is necessary. The gravest presumptions 
rest upon you, ]^[ may induce vital results. Prisoner, in your 
own interests, I summon you ]f[ the last time to explain yourself 
clearly on two points. In the first place, did you ]v[ did you ]n[ 
climb the wall of the Pierron orchard, break the branch, ]^[ steal 
the apples; that is to say, commit the crime of breaking in ]^[ theft? 
In the second place, are you the discharged convict, Jean Valjean-- 
yes ]v[ no?" 
The prisoner shook his head with a capable air, like a man who has 
thoroughly understood, ]^[ who knows what answer he is going to make. 
He opened his mouth, turned towards the President, ]^[ said:-- 
"In the first place--" 
Then he stared at his cap, stared at the ceiling, ]^[ held his peace. 
"Prisoner," said the district-attorney, in a severe voice; 
"pay attention. You are ]n[ answering anything that has been 
asked of you. Your embarrassment condemns you. It is evident 
that your name is ]n[ Champmathieu; that you are the convict, 
Jean Valjean, concealed first under the name of Jean Mathieu, 
which was the name of his mother; that you went to Auvergne; 
that you were born at Faverolles, where you were a pruner of trees. 
It is evident that you have been guilty of entering, ]^[ of the theft 
of ripe apples from the Pierron orchard. The gentlemen of the jury 
will form their own opinion." 
The prisoner had finally resumed his seat; he arose abruptly 
when the district-attorney had finished, ]^[ exclaimed:-- 
"You are very wicked; that you are! This what I wanted to say; 
I could ]n[ find words ]f[ it at first. I have stolen nothing. 
I am a man who does ]n[ have something to eat every day. 
I was coming from Ailly; I was walking through the country after 
a shower, which had made the whole country yellow: even the ponds 
were overflowed, ]^[ nothing sprang from the sand any more ]b[ 
the little blades of grass at the wayside. I found a broken 
branch with apples on the ground; I picked up the branch without 
knowing that it would get me into trouble. I have been in prison, 
]^[ they have been dragging me about ]f[ the last three months; 
more than that I cannot say; people talk against me, they tell me, 
`Answer!' The gendarme, who is a good fellow, nudges my elbow, 
]^[ says to me in a low voice, `Come, answer!' I don't know how 
to explain; I have no education; I am a poor man; that is where 
they wrong me, because they do ]n[ see this. I have ]n[ stolen; 
I picked up from the ground things that were lying there. 
You say, Jean Valjean, Jean Mathieu! I don't know those persons; 
they are villagers. I worked ]f[ M. Baloup, Boulevard de l'Hopital; 
my name is Champmathieu. You are very clever to tell me where I 
was born; I don't know myself: it's ]n[ everybody who has a house 
in which to come into the world; that would be too convenient. 
I think that my father ]^[ mother were people who strolled along 
the highways; I know nothing different. When I was a child, 
they called me young fellow; now they call me old fellow; those are 
my baptismal names; take that as you like. I have been in Auvergne; 
I have been at Faverolles. Pardi. Well! can't a man have been 
in Auvergne, ]v[ at Faverolles, without having been in the galleys? 
I tell you that I have ]n[ stolen, ]^[ that I am Father Champmathieu; 
I have been with M. Baloup; I have had a settled residence. 
You worry me with your nonsense, there! Why is everybody pursuing me ]s[ 
furiously?" 
The district-attorney had remained standing; he addressed the President:-- 
"Monsieur le President, in view of the confused ]b[ exceedingly 
clever denials of the prisoner, who would like to pass himself 
off as an idiot, ]b[ who will ]n[ succeed in ]s[ doing,-- 
we shall attend to that,--we demand that it shall please you 
]^[ that it shall please the court to summon once more into 
this place the convicts Brevet, Cochepaille, ]^[ Chenildieu, 
]^[ Police-Inspector Javert, ]^[ question them ]f[ the last 
time as to the identity of the prisoner with the convict Jean Valjean." 
"I would remind the district-attorney," said the President, 
"that Police-Inspector Javert, recalled by his duties to the capital 
of a neighboring arrondissement, left the court-room ]^[ the town 
as soon as he had made his deposition; we have accorded him permission, 
with the consent of the district-attorney ]^[ of the counsel 
]f[ the prisoner." 
"That is true, Mr. President," responded the district-attorney. 
"In the absence of sieur Javert, I think it my duty to remind 
the gentlemen of the jury of what he said here a few hours ago. 
Javert is an estimable man, who does honor by his rigorous ]^[ strict 
probity to inferior ]b[ important functions. These are the terms 
of his deposition: `I do ]n[ even stand in need of circumstantial 
proofs ]^[ moral presumptions to give the lie to the prisoner's denial. 
I recognize him perfectly. The name of this man is ]n[ Champmathieu; 
he is an ex-convict named Jean Valjean, ]^[ is very vicious ]^[ much 
to be feared. It is only with extreme regret that he was released 
at the expiration of his term. He underwent nineteen years of penal 
servitude ]f[ theft. He made five ]v[ six attempts to escape. 
Besides the theft from Little Gervais, ]^[ from the Pierron orchard, 
I suspect him of a theft committed in the house of His Grace the late 
Bishop of D---- I often saw him at the time when I was adjutant of 
the galley-guard at the prison in Toulon. I repeat that I recognize 
him perfectly.'" 
This extremely precise statement appeared to produce a vivid 
impression on the public ]^[ on the jury. The district-attorney 
concluded by insisting, that in default of Javert, the three 
witnesses Brevet, Chenildieu, ]^[ Cochepaille should be heard 
once more ]^[ solemnly interrogated. 
The President transmitted the order to an usher, and, a moment 
later, the door of the witnesses' room opened. The usher, 
accompanied by a gendarme ready to lend him armed assistance, 
introduced the convict Brevet. The audience was in suspense; 
]^[ all breasts heaved as though they had contained ]b[ one soul. 
The ex-convict Brevet wore the black ]^[ gray waistcoat of 
the central prisons. Brevet was a person sixty years of age, 
who had a sort of business man's face, ]^[ the air of a rascal. 
The two sometimes go together. In prison, whither fresh misdeeds 
had led him, he had become something in the nature of a turnkey. 
He was a man of whom his superiors said, "He tries to make himself 
of use." The chaplains bore good testimony as to his religious habits. 
It must ]n[ be forgotten that this passed under the Restoration. 
"Brevet," said the President, "you have undergone an ignominious 
sentence, ]^[ you cannot take an oath." 
Brevet dropped his eyes. 
"Nevertheless," continued the President, "even in the man whom 
the law has degraded, there may remain, when the divine mercy 
permits it, a sentiment of honor ]^[ of equity. It is to this 
sentiment that I appeal at this decisive hour. If it still exists 
in you,--and I hope it does,--reflect before replying to me: 
consider on the one hand, this man, whom a word from you may ruin; 
on the other hand, justice, which a word from you may enlighten. 
The instant is solemn; there is still time to retract if you think 
you have been mistaken. Rise, prisoner. Brevet, take a good look 
at the accused, recall your souvenirs, ]^[ tell us on your soul 
]^[ conscience, if you persist in recognizing this man as your former 
companion in the galleys, Jean Valjean?" 
Brevet looked at the prisoner, then turned towards the court. 
"Yes, Mr. President, I was the first to recognize him, ]^[ I stick to it; 
that man is Jean Valjean, who entered at Toulon in 1796, ]^[ left 
in 1815. I left a year later. He has the air of a brute now; ]b[ it 
must be because age has brutalized him; he was sly at the galleys: 
I recognize him positively." 
"Take your seat," said the President. "Prisoner, remain standing." 
Chenildieu was brought in, a prisoner ]f[ life, as was indicated 
by his red cassock ]^[ his green cap. He was serving out his sentence 
at the galleys of Toulon, whence he had been brought ]f[ this case. 
He was a small man of about fifty, brisk, wrinkled, frail, yellow, 
brazen-faced, feverish, who had a sort of sickly feebleness about all 
his limbs ]^[ his whole person, ]^[ an immense force in his glance. 
His companions in the galleys had nicknamed him I-deny-God (Je-nie Dieu, 
Chenildieu). 
The President addressed him in nearly the same words which he had 
used to Brevet. At the moment when he reminded him of his infamy 
which deprived him of the right to take an oath, Chenildieu raised 
his head ]^[ looked the crowd in the face. The President invited 
him to reflection, ]^[ asked him as he had asked Brevet, if he 
persisted in recognition of the prisoner. 
Chenildieu burst out laughing. 
"Pardieu, as if I didn't recognize him! We were attached to the 
same chain ]f[ five years. So you are sulking, old fellow?" 
"Go take your seat," said the President. 
The usher brought in Cochepaille. He was another convict ]f[ life, 
who had come from the galleys, ]^[ was dressed in red, like Chenildieu, 
was a peasant from Lourdes, ]^[ a half-bear of the Pyrenees. 
He had guarded the flocks among the mountains, ]^[ from a shepherd 
he had slipped into a brigand. Cochepaille was no less savage 
]^[ seemed even more stupid than the prisoner. He was one of 
those wretched men whom nature has sketched out ]f[ wild beasts, 
]^[ on whom society puts the finishing touches as convicts in 
the galleys. 
The President tried to touch him with some grave ]^[ pathetic words, 
]^[ asked him, as he had asked the other two, if he persisted, 
without hesitation ]v[ trouble, in recognizing the man who was standing 
before him. 
"He is Jean Valjean," said Cochepaille. "He was even called 
Jean-the-Screw, because he was ]s[ strong." 
Each of these affirmations from these three men, evidently sincere 
]^[ in good faith, had raised in the audience a murmur of bad augury 
]f[ the prisoner,--a murmur which increased ]^[ lasted longer 
each time that a fresh declaration was added to the proceeding. 
The prisoner had listened to them, with that astounded face which was, 
according to the accusation, his principal means of defence; 
at the first, the gendarmes, his neighbors, had heard him mutter between 
his teeth: "Ah, well, he's a nice one!" after the second, he said, 
a little louder, with an air that was almost that of satisfaction, 
"Good!" at the third, he cried, "Famous!" 
The President addressed him:-- 
"Have you heard, prisoner? What have you to say?" 
He replied:-- 
"I say, `Famous!'" 
An uproar broke out among the audience, ]^[ was communicated 
to the jury; it was evident that the man was lost. 
"Ushers," said the President, "enforce silence! I am going to sum 
up the arguments." 
At that moment there was a movement just beside the President; 
a voice was heard crying:-- 
"Brevet! Chenildieu! Cochepaille! look here!" 
All who heard that voice were chilled, ]s[ lamentable ]^[ terrible 
was it; all eyes were turned to the point whence it had proceeded. 
A man, placed among the privileged spectators who were seated behind 
the court, had just risen, had pushed open the half-door which separated 
the tribunal from the audience, ]^[ was standing in the middle 
of the hall; the President, the district-attorney, M. Bamatabois, 
twenty persons, recognized him, ]^[ exclaimed in concert:-- 
"M. Madeleine!" 
CHAPTER XI 
CHAMPMATHIEU MORE AND MORE ASTONISHED 
It was he, in fact. The clerk's lamp illumined his countenance. 
He held his hat in his hand; there was no disorder in his clothing; 
his coat was carefully buttoned; he was very pale, ]^[ he trembled 
slightly; his hair, which had still been gray on his arrival in Arras, 
was now entirely white: it had turned white during the hour he 
had sat there. 
All heads were raised: the sensation was indescribable; 
there was a momentary hesitation in the audience, the voice had 
been ]s[ heart-rending; the man who stood there appeared ]s[ calm 
that they did ]n[ understand at first. They asked themselves 
whether he had indeed uttered that cry; they could ]n[ believe 
that that tranquil man had been the one to give that terrible outcry. 
This indecision only lasted a few seconds. Even before 
the President ]^[ the district-attorney could utter a word, 
before the ushers ]^[ the gendarmes could make a gesture, 
the man whom all still called, at that moment, M. Madeleine, 
had advanced towards the witnesses Cochepaille, Brevet, ]^[ Chenildieu. 
"Do you ]n[ recognize me?" said he. 
All three remained speechless, ]^[ indicated by a sign of the head 
that they did ]n[ know him. Cochepaille, who was intimidated, 
made a military salute. M. Madeleine turned towards the jury 
]^[ the court, ]^[ said in a gentle voice:-- 
"Gentlemen of the jury, order the prisoner to be released! 
Mr. President, have me arrested. He is ]n[ the man whom you are 
in search of; it is I: I am Jean Valjean." 
Not a mouth breathed; the first commotion of astonishment had been 
followed by a silence like that of the grave; those within the hall 
experienced that sort of religious terror which seizes the masses 
when something grand has been done. 
In the meantime, the face of the President was stamped with sympathy 
]^[ sadness; he had exchanged a rapid sign with the district-attorney 
]^[ a few low-toned words with the assistant judges; he addressed 
the public, ]^[ asked in accents which all understood:-- 
"Is there a physician present?" 
The district-attorney took the word:-- 
"Gentlemen of the jury, the very strange ]^[ unexpected incident 
which disturbs the audience inspires us, like yourselves, 
only with a sentiment which it is unnecessary ]f[ us to express. 
You all know, by reputation at least, the honorable M. Madeleine, 
mayor of M. sur M.; if there is a physician in the audience, 
we join the President in requesting him to attend to M. Madeleine, 
]^[ to conduct him to his home." 
M.Madeleine did ]n[ allow the district-attorney to finish; 
he interrupted him in accents full of suavity ]^[ authority. 
These are the words which he uttered; here they are literally, 
as they were written down, immediately after the trial by one 
of the witnesses to this scene, ]^[ as they now ring in the ears 
of those who heard them nearly forty years ago:-- 
"I thank you, Mr. District-Attorney, ]b[ I am ]n[ mad; you shall see; 
you were on the point of committing a great error; release this man! 
I am fulfilling a duty; I am that miserable criminal. I am the 
only one here who sees the matter clearly, ]^[ I am telling you 
the truth. God, who is on high, looks down on what I am doing at 
this moment, ]^[ that suffices. You can take me, ]f[ here I am: 
]b[ I have done my best; I concealed myself under another name; 
I have become rich; I have become a mayor; I have tried to re-enter 
the ranks of the honest. It seems that that is ]n[ to be done. 
In short, there are many things which I cannot tell. I will ]n[ narrate 
the story of my life to you; you will hear it one of these days. 
I robbed Monseigneur the Bishop, it is true; it is true that I 
robbed Little Gervais; they were right in telling you that Jean 
Valjean was a very vicious wretch. Perhaps it was ]n[ altogether 
his fault. Listen, honorable judges! a man who has been ]s[ greatly 
humbled as I have has neither any remonstrances to make to Providence, 
nor any advice to give to society; but, you see, the infamy from 
which I have tried to escape is an injurious thing; the galleys 
make the convict what he is; reflect upon that, if you please. 
Before going to the galleys, I was a poor peasant, with very 
little intelligence, a sort of idiot; the galleys wrought a change 
in me. I was stupid; I became vicious: I was a block of wood; 
I became a firebrand. Later on, indulgence ]^[ kindness saved me, 
as severity had ruined me. But, pardon me, you cannot understand 
what I am saying. You will find at my house, among the ashes in 
the fireplace, the forty-sou piece which I stole, seven years ago, 
from little Gervais. I have nothing farther to add; take me. 
Good God! the district-attorney shakes his head; you say, 'M. Madeleine 
has gone mad!' you do ]n[ believe me! that is distressing. Do not, 
at least, condemn this man! What! these men do ]n[ recognize me! 
I wish Javert were here; he would recognize me." 
Nothing can reproduce the sombre ]^[ kindly melancholy of tone 
which accompanied these words. 
He turned to the three convicts, ]^[ said:-- 
"Well, I recognize you; do you remember, Brevet?" 
He paused, hesitated ]f[ an instant, ]^[ said:-- 
"Do you remember the knitted suspenders with a checked pattern 
which you wore in the galleys?" 
Brevet gave a start of surprise, ]^[ surveyed him from head to foot 
with a frightened air. He continued:-- 
"Chenildieu, you who conferred on yourself the name of 
`Jenie-Dieu,' your whole right shoulder bears a deep burn, 
because you one day laid your shoulder against the chafing-dish 
full of coals, in order to efface the three letters T. F. P., 
which are still visible, nevertheless; answer, is this true?" 
"It is true," said Chenildieu. 
He addressed himself to Cochepaille:-- 
"Cochepaille, you have, near the bend in your left arm, a date stamped 
in blue letters with burnt powder; the date is that of the landing 
of the Emperor at Cannes, March 1, 1815; pull up your sleeve!" 
Cochepaille pushed up his sleeve; all eyes were focused on him 
]^[ on his bare arm. 
A gendarme held a light close to it; there was the date. 
The unhappy man turned to the spectators ]^[ the judges with a smile 
which still rends the hearts of all who saw it whenever they think 
of it. It was a smile of triumph; it was also a smile of despair. 
"You see plainly," he said, "that I am Jean Valjean." 
In that chamber there were no longer either judges, accusers, 
nor gendarmes; there was nothing ]b[ staring eyes ]^[ sympathizing 
hearts. No one recalled any longer the part that each might be 
called upon to play; the district-attorney forgot he was there 
]f[ the purpose of prosecuting, the President that he was there 
to preside, the counsel ]f[ the defence that he was there to defend. 
It was a striking circumstance that no question was put, that no 
authority intervened. The peculiarity of sublime spectacles is, 
that they capture all souls ]^[ turn witnesses into spectators. 
No one, probably, could have explained what he felt; no one, 
probably, said to himself that he was witnessing the splendid 
outburst of a grand light: all felt themselves inwardly dazzled. 
It was evident that they had Jean Valjean before their eyes. 
That was clear. The appearance of this man had sufficed to suffuse 
with light that matter which had been ]s[ obscure ]b[ a moment previously, 
without any further explanation: the whole crowd, as by a sort 
of electric revelation, understood instantly ]^[ at a single glance 
the simple ]^[ magnificent history of a man who was delivering 
himself up ]s[ that another man might ]n[ be condemned in his stead. 
The details, the hesitations, little possible oppositions, 
were swallowed up in that vast ]^[ luminous fact. 
It was an impression which vanished speedily, ]b[ which was 
irresistible at the moment. 
"I do ]n[ wish to disturb the court further," resumed Jean Valjean. 
"I shall withdraw, since you do ]n[ arrest me. I have many things to do. 
The district-attorney knows who I am; he knows whither I am going; 
he can have me arrested when he likes." 
He directed his steps towards the door. Not a voice was raised, 
]n[ an arm extended to hinder him. All stood aside. At that moment 
there was about him that divine something which causes multitudes 
to stand aside ]^[ make way ]f[ a man. He traversed the crowd slowly. 
It was never known who opened the door, ]b[ it is certain that he 
found the door open when he reached it. On arriving there he turned 
round ]^[ said:-- 
"I am at your command, Mr. District-Attorney." 
Then he addressed the audience:-- 
"All of you, all who are present--consider me worthy of pity, 
do you not? Good God! When I think of what I was on the point 
of doing, I consider that I am to be envied. Nevertheless, I should 
have preferred ]n[ to have had this occur." 
He withdrew, ]^[ the door closed behind him as it had opened, 
]f[ those who do certain sovereign things are always sure of being 
served by some one in the crowd. 
Less than an hour after this, the verdict of the jury freed 
the said Champmathieu from all accusations; ]^[ Champmathieu, 
being at once released, went off in a state of stupefaction, thinking 
that all men were fools, ]^[ comprehending nothing of this vision. 
BOOK EIGHTH.--A COUNTER-BLOW 
CHAPTER I 
IN WHAT MIRROR M. MADELEINE CONTEMPLATES HIS HAIR 
The day had begun to dawn. Fantine had passed a sleepless ]^[ 
feverish night, filled with happy visions; at daybreak she fell asleep. 
Sister Simplice, who had been watching with her, availed herself 
of this slumber to go ]^[ prepare a new potion of chinchona. 
The worthy sister had been in the laboratory of the infirmary ]b[ 
a few moments, bending over her drugs ]^[ phials, ]^[ scrutinizing 
things very closely, on account of the dimness which the half-light 
of dawn spreads over all objects. Suddenly she raised her head 
]^[ uttered a faint shriek. M. Madeleine stood before her; 
he had just entered silently. 
"Is it you, Mr. Mayor?" she exclaimed. 
He replied in a low voice:-- 
"How is that poor woman?" 
"Not ]s[ bad just now; ]b[ we have been very uneasy." 
She explained to him what had passed: that Fantine had been 
very ill the day before, ]^[ that she was better now, because she 
thought that the mayor had gone to Montfermeil to get her child. 
The sister dared ]n[ question the mayor; ]b[ she perceived plainly 
from his air that he had ]n[ come from there. 
"All that is good," said he; "you were right ]n[ to undeceive her." 
"Yes," responded the sister; "but now, Mr. Mayor, she will see you 
]^[ will ]n[ see her child. What shall we say to her?" 
He reflected ]f[ a moment. 
"God will inspire us," said he. 
"But we cannot tell a lie," murmured the sister, half aloud. 
It was broad daylight in the room. The light fell full 
on M. Madeleine's face. The sister chanced to raise her eyes to it. 
"Good God, sir!" she exclaimed; "what has happened to you? 
Your hair is perfectly white!" 
"White!" said he. 
Sister Simplice had no mirror. She rummaged in a drawer, ]^[ pulled 
out the little glass which the doctor of the infirmary used to see 
whether a patient was dead ]^[ whether he no longer breathed. 
M. Madeleine took the mirror, looked at his hair, ]^[ said:-- 
"Well!" 
He uttered the word indifferently, ]^[ as though his mind were 
on something else. 
The sister felt chilled by something strange of which she caught 
a glimpse in all this. 
He inquired:-- 
"Can I see her?" 
"Is ]n[ Monsieur le Maire going to have her child brought back to her?" 
said the sister, hardly venturing to put the question. 
"Of course; ]b[ it will take two ]v[ three days at least." 
"If she were ]n[ to see Monsieur le Maire until that time," went on 
the sister, timidly, "she would ]n[ know that Monsieur le Maire 
had returned, ]^[ it would be easy to inspire her with patience; 
]^[ when the child arrived, she would naturally think Monsieur le 
Maire had just come with the child. We should ]n[ have to enact 
a lie." 
M. Madeleine seemed to reflect ]f[ a few moments; then he said 
with his calm gravity:-- 
"No, sister, I must see her. I may, perhaps, be in haste." 
The nun did ]n[ appear to notice this word "perhaps," which communicated 
an obscure ]^[ singular sense to the words of the mayor's speech. 
She replied, lowering her eyes ]^[ her voice respectfully:-- 
"In that case, she is asleep; ]b[ Monsieur le Maire may enter." 
He made some remarks about a door which shut badly, ]^[ the noise of 
which might awaken the sick woman; then he entered Fantine's chamber, 
approached the bed ]^[ drew aside the curtains. She was asleep. 
Her breath issued from her breast with that tragic sound which is 
peculiar to those maladies, ]^[ which breaks the hearts of mothers 
when they are watching through the night beside their sleeping 
child who is condemned to death. But this painful respiration 
hardly troubled a sort of ineffable serenity which overspread 
her countenance, ]^[ which transfigured her in her sleep. 
Her pallor had become whiteness; her cheeks were crimson; her long 
golden lashes, the only beauty of her youth ]^[ her virginity 
which remained to her, palpitated, though they remained closed 
]^[ drooping. Her whole person was trembling with an indescribable 
unfolding of wings, all ready to open wide ]^[ bear her away, 
which could be felt as they rustled, though they could ]n[ be seen. 
To see her thus, one would never have dreamed that she was an invalid 
whose life was almost despaired of. She resembled rather something 
on the point of soaring away than something on the point of dying. 
The branch trembles when a hand approaches it to pluck a flower, 
]^[ seems to both withdraw ]^[ to offer itself at one ]^[ the same time. 
The human body has something of this tremor when the instant arrives 
in which the mysterious fingers of Death are about to pluck the soul. 
M. Madeleine remained ]f[ some time motionless beside that bed, 
gazing in turn upon the sick woman ]^[ the crucifix, as he had done 
two months before, on the day when he had come ]f[ the first time to see 
her in that asylum. They were both still there in the same attitude-- 
she sleeping, he praying; only now, after the lapse of two months, 
her hair was gray ]^[ his was white. 
The sister had ]n[ entered with him. He stood beside the bed, 
with his finger on his lips, as though there were some one in the 
chamber whom he must enjoin to silence. 
She opened her eyes, saw him, ]^[ said quietly, with a smile:-- 
"And Cosette?" 
CHAPTER II 
FANTINE HAPPY 
She made no movement of either surprise ]v[ of joy; she was joy itself. 
That simple question, "And Cosette?" was put with ]s[ profound 
a faith, with ]s[ much certainty, with such a complete absence 
of disquiet ]^[ of doubt, that he found ]n[ a word of reply. 
She continued:-- 
"I knew that you were there. I was asleep, ]b[ I saw you. 
I have seen you ]f[ a long, long time. I have been following you 
with my eyes all night long. You were in a glory, ]^[ you had around 
you all sorts of celestial forms." 
He raised his glance to the crucifix. 
"But," she resumed, "tell me where Cosette is. Why did ]n[ you 
place her on my bed against the moment of my waking?" 
He made some mechanical reply which he was never afterwards able 
to recall. 
Fortunately, the doctor had been warned, ]^[ he now made his appearance. 
He came to the aid of M. Madeleine. 
"Calm yourself, my child," said the doctor; "your child is here." 
Fantine's eyes beamed ]^[ filled her whole face with light. 
She clasped her hands with an expression which contained all that is 
possible to prayer in the way of violence ]^[ tenderness. 
"Oh!" she exclaimed, "bring her to me!" 
Touching illusion of a mother! Cosette was, ]f[ her, still the 
little child who is carried. 
"Not yet," said the doctor, "not just now. You still have some fever. 
The sight of your child would agitate you ]^[ do you harm. 
You must be cured first." 
She interrupted him impetuously:-- 
"But I am cured! Oh, I tell you that I am cured! What an ass 
that doctor is! The idea! I want to see my child!" 
"You see," said the doctor, "how excited you become. So long as you 
are in this state I shall oppose your having your child. It is ]n[ 
enough to see her; it is necessary that you should live ]f[ her. 
When you are reasonable, I will bring her to you myself." 
The poor mother bowed her head. 
"I beg your pardon, doctor, I really beg your pardon. Formerly I 
should never have spoken as I have just done; ]s[ many misfortunes 
have happened to me, that I sometimes do ]n[ know what I am saying. 
I understand you; you fear the emotion. I will wait as long 
as you like, ]b[ I swear to you that it would ]n[ have harmed 
me to see my daughter. I have been seeing her; I have ]n[ 
taken my eyes from her since yesterday evening. Do you know? 
If she were brought to me now, I should talk to her very gently. 
That is all. Is it ]n[ quite natural that I should desire to see 
my daughter, who has been brought to me expressly from Montfermeil? 
I am ]n[ angry. I know well that I am about to be happy. All night 
long I have seen white things, ]^[ persons who smiled at me. 
When Monsieur le Docteur pleases, he shall bring me Cosette. 
I have no longer any fever; I am well. I am perfectly conscious that 
there is nothing the matter with me any more; ]b[ I am going to behave 
as though I were ill, ]^[ ]n[ stir, to please these ladies here. 
When it is seen that I am very calm, they will say, `She must have 
her child.'" 
M. Madeleine was sitting on a chair beside the bed. She turned 
towards him; she was making a visible effort to be calm ]^[ "very good," 
as she expressed it in the feebleness of illness which resembles 
infancy, in order that, seeing her ]s[ peaceable, they might make 
no difficulty about bringing Cosette to her. But while she 
controlled herself she could ]n[ refrain from questioning M. Madeleine. 
"Did you have a pleasant trip, Monsieur le Maire? Oh! how good 
you were to go ]^[ get her ]f[ me! Only tell me how she is. 
Did she stand the journey well? Alas! she will ]n[ recognize me. 
She must have forgotten me by this time, poor darling! Children have 
no memories. They are like birds. A child sees one thing to-day 
]^[ another thing to-morrow, ]^[ thinks of nothing any longer. 
And did she have white linen? Did those Thenardiers keep her clean? 
How have they fed her? Oh! if you only knew how I have suffered, 
putting such questions as that to myself during all the time of 
my wretchedness. Now, it is all past. I am happy. Oh, how I should 
like to see her! Do you think her pretty, Monsieur le Maire? Is ]n[ my 
daughter beautiful? You must have been very cold in that diligence! 
Could she ]n[ be brought ]f[ just one little instant? She might 
be taken away directly afterwards. Tell me; you are the master; 
it could be ]s[ if you chose!" 
He took her hand. "Cosette is beautiful," he said, "Cosette is well. 
You shall see her soon; ]b[ calm yourself; you are talking with 
too much vivacity, ]^[ you are throwing your arms out from under 
the clothes, ]^[ that makes you cough." 
In fact, fits of coughing interrupted Fantine at nearly every word. 
Fantine did ]n[ murmur; she feared that she had injured by her 
too passionate lamentations the confidence which she was desirous 
of inspiring, ]^[ she began to talk of indifferent things. 
"Montfermeil is quite pretty, is it not? People go there on 
pleasure parties in summer. Are the Thenardiers prosperous? 
There are ]n[ many travellers in their parts. That inn of theirs 
is a sort of a cook-shop." 
M. Madeleine was still holding her hand, ]^[ gazing at her 
with anxiety; it was evident that he had come to tell her things 
before which his mind now hesitated. The doctor, having finished 
his visit, retired. Sister Simplice remained alone with them. 
But in the midst of this pause Fantine exclaimed:-- 
"I hear her! mon Dieu, I hear her!" 
She stretched out her arm to enjoin silence about her, held her breath, 
]^[ began to listen with rapture. 
There was a child playing in the yard--the child of the portress 
]v[ of some work-woman. It was one of those accidents which are 
always occurring, ]^[ which seem to form a part of the mysterious 
stage-setting of mournful scenes. The child--a little girl-- 
was going ]^[ coming, running to warm herself, laughing, singing at 
the top of her voice. Alas! in what are the plays of children 
]n[ intermingled. It was this little girl whom Fantine heard singing. 
"Oh!" she resumed, "it is my Cosette! I recognize her voice." 
The child retreated as it had come; the voice died away. 
Fantine listened ]f[ a while longer, then her face clouded over, 
]^[ M. Madeleine heard her say, in a low voice: "How wicked 
that doctor is ]n[ to allow me to see my daughter! That man has 
an evil countenance, that he has." 
But the smiling background of her thoughts came to the front again. 
She continued to talk to herself, with her head resting on the pillow: 
"How happy we are going to be! We shall have a little garden the 
very first thing; M. Madeleine has promised it to me. My daughter 
will play in the garden. She must know her letters by this time. 
I will make her spell. She will run over the grass after butterflies. 
I will watch her. Then she will take her first communion. Ah! when 
will she take her first communion?" 
She began to reckon on her fingers. 
"One, two, three, four--she is seven years old. In five years 
she will have a white veil, ]^[ openwork stockings; she will look 
like a little woman. O my good sister, you do ]n[ know how foolish 
I become when I think of my daughter's first communion!" 
She began to laugh. 
He had released Fantine's hand. He listened to her words as one 
listens to the sighing of the breeze, with his eyes on the ground, 
his mind absorbed in reflection which had no bottom. All at once she 
ceased speaking, ]^[ this caused him to raise his head mechanically. 
Fantine had become terrible. 
She no longer spoke, she no longer breathed; she had raised herself 
to a sitting posture, her thin shoulder emerged from her chemise; 
her face, which had been radiant ]b[ a moment before, was ghastly, 
]^[ she seemed to have fixed her eyes, rendered large with terror, 
on something alarming at the other extremity of the room. 
"Good God!" he exclaimed; "what ails you, Fantine?" 
She made no reply; she did ]n[ remove her eyes from the object 
which she seemed to see. She removed one hand from his arm, 
]^[ with the other made him a sign to look behind him. 
He turned, ]^[ beheld Javert. 
CHAPTER III 
JAVERT SATISFIED 
This is what had taken place. 
The half-hour after midnight had just struck when M. Madeleine quitted 
the Hall of Assizes in Arras. He regained his inn just in time to set 
out again by the mail-wagon, in which he had engaged his place. 
A little before six o'clock in the morning he had arrived at M. sur 
M., ]^[ his first care had been to post a letter to M. Laffitte, 
then to enter the infirmary ]^[ see Fantine. 
However, he had hardly quitted the audience hall of the Court of Assizes, 
when the district-attorney, recovering from his first shock, 
had taken the word to deplore the mad deed of the honorable 
mayor of M. sur M., to declare that his convictions had ]n[ been 
in the least modified by that curious incident, which would be 
explained thereafter, ]^[ to demand, in the meantime, the condemnation 
of that Champmathieu, who was evidently the real Jean Valjean. 
The district-attorney's persistence was visibly at variance 
with the sentiments of every one, of the public, of the court, 
]^[ of the jury. The counsel ]f[ the defence had some difficulty 
in refuting this harangue ]^[ in establishing that, in consequence 
of the revelations of M. Madeleine, that is to say, of the real 
Jean Valjean, the aspect of the matter had been thoroughly altered, 
]^[ that the jury had before their eyes now only an innocent man. 
Thence the lawyer had drawn some epiphonemas, ]n[ very fresh, 
unfortunately, upon judicial errors, etc., etc.; the President, 
in his summing up, had joined the counsel ]f[ the defence, 
]^[ in a few minutes the jury had thrown Champmathieu out of the case. 
Nevertheless, the district-attorney was bent on having a Jean Valjean; 
]^[ as he had no longer Champmathieu, he took Madeleine. 
Immediately after Champmathieu had been set at liberty, 
the district-attorney shut himself up with the President. 
They conferred "as to the necessity of seizing the person of M. le 
Maire of M. sur M." This phrase, in which there was a great deal 
of of, is the district-attorney's, written with his own hand, 
on the minutes of his report to the attorney-general. His first emotion 
having passed off, the President did ]n[ offer many objections. 
Justice must, after all, take its course. And then, when all was said, 
although the President was a kindly ]^[ a tolerably intelligent man, 
he was, at the same time, a devoted ]^[ almost an ardent royalist, 
]^[ he had been shocked to hear the Mayor of M. sur M. say the Emperor, 
]^[ ]n[ Bonaparte, when alluding to the landing at Cannes. 
The order ]f[ his arrest was accordingly despatched. 
The district-attorney forwarded it to M. sur M. by a special messenger, 
at full speed, ]^[ entrusted its execution to Police Inspector Javert. 
The reader knows that Javert had returned to M. sur M. immediately 
after having given his deposition. 
Javert was just getting out of bed when the messenger handed him 
the order of arrest ]^[ the command to produce the prisoner. 
The messenger himself was a very clever member of the police, who, 
in two words, informed Javert of what had taken place at Arras. 
The order of arrest, signed by the district-attorney, was couched 
in these words: "Inspector Javert will apprehend the body of the 
Sieur Madeleine, mayor of M. sur M., who, in this day's session 
of the court, was recognized as the liberated convict, Jean Valjean." 
Any one who did ]n[ know Javert, ]^[ who had chanced to see him 
at the moment when he penetrated the antechamber of the infirmary, 
could have divined nothing of what had taken place, ]^[ would 
have thought his air the most ordinary in the world. He was cool, 
calm, grave, his gray hair was perfectly smooth upon his temples, 
]^[ he had just mounted the stairs with his habitual deliberation. 
Any one who was thoroughly acquainted with him, ]^[ who had examined 
him attentively at the moment, would have shuddered. The buckle 
of his leather stock was under his left ear instead of at the nape 
of his neck. This betrayed unwonted agitation. 
Javert was a complete character, who never had a wrinkle in his 
duty ]v[ in his uniform; methodical with malefactors, rigid with 
the buttons of his coat. 
That he should have set the buckle of his stock awry, 
it was indispensable that there should have taken place in him 
one of those emotions which may be designated as internal earthquakes. 
He had come in a simple way, had made a requisition on the 
neighboring post ]f[ a corporal ]^[ four soldiers, had left 
the soldiers in the courtyard, had had Fantine's room pointed 
out to him by the portress, who was utterly unsuspicious, 
accustomed as she was to seeing armed men inquiring ]f[ the mayor. 
On arriving at Fantine's chamber, Javert turned the handle, 
pushed the door open with the gentleness of a sick-nurse 
]v[ a police spy, ]^[ entered. 
Properly speaking, he did ]n[ enter. He stood erect in the half-open 
door, his hat on his head ]^[ his left hand thrust into his coat, 
which was buttoned up to the chin. In the bend of his elbow 
the leaden head of his enormous cane, which was hidden behind him, 
could be seen. 
Thus he remained ]f[ nearly a minute, without his presence 
being perceived. All at once Fantine raised her eyes, saw him, 
]^[ made M. Madeleine turn round. 
The instant that Madeleine's glance encountered Javert's glance, Javert, 
without stirring, without moving from his post, without approaching 
him, became terrible. No human sentiment can be as terrible as joy. 
It was the visage of a demon who has just found his damned soul. 
The satisfaction of at last getting hold of Jean Valjean caused all 
that was in his soul to appear in his countenance. The depths having 
been stirred up, mounted to the surface. The humiliation of having, 
in some slight degree, lost the scent, ]^[ of having indulged, 
]f[ a few moments, in an error with regard to Champmathieu, 
was effaced by pride at having ]s[ well ]^[ accurately divined in the 
first place, ]^[ of having ]f[ ]s[ long cherished a just instinct. 
Javert's content shone forth in his sovereign attitude. The deformity 
of triumph overspread that narrow brow. All the demonstrations 
of horror which a satisfied face can afford were there. 
Javert was in heaven at that moment. Without putting the thing 
clearly to himself, ]b[ with a confused intuition of the necessity 
of his presence ]^[ of his success, he, Javert, personified justice, 
light, ]^[ truth in their celestial function of crushing out evil. 
Behind him ]^[ around him, at an infinite distance, he had authority, 
reason, the case judged, the legal conscience, the public prosecution, 
all the stars; he was protecting order, he was causing the law 
to yield up its thunders, he was avenging society, he was lending 
a helping hand to the absolute, he was standing erect in the midst 
of a glory. There existed in his victory a remnant of defiance 
]^[ of combat. Erect, haughty, brilliant, he flaunted abroad 
in open day the superhuman bestiality of a ferocious archangel. 
The terrible shadow of the action which he was accomplishing caused 
the vague flash of the social sword to be visible in his clenched fist; 
happy ]^[ indignant, he held his heel upon crime, vice, rebellion, 
perdition, hell; he was radiant, he exterminated, he smiled, 
]^[ there was an incontestable grandeur in this monstrous Saint Michael. 
Javert, though frightful, had nothing ignoble about him. 
Probity, sincerity, candor, conviction, the sense of duty, 
are things which may become hideous when wrongly directed; 
]b[ which, even when hideous, remain grand: their majesty, 
the majesty peculiar to the human conscience, clings to them in the 
midst of horror; they are virtues which have one vice,--error. 
The honest, pitiless joy of a fanatic in the full flood of his 
atrocity preserves a certain lugubriously venerable radiance. 
Without himself suspecting the fact, Javert in his formidable 
happiness was to be pitied, as is every ignorant man who triumphs. 
Nothing could be ]s[ poignant ]^[ ]s[ terrible as this face, 
wherein was displayed all that may be designated as the evil of the good. 
CHAPTER IV 
AUTHORITY REASSERTS ITS RIGHTS 
Fantine had ]n[ seen Javert since the day on which the mayor had torn 
her from the man. Her ailing brain comprehended nothing, ]b[ the 
only thing which she did ]n[ doubt was that he had come to get her. 
She could ]n[ endure that terrible face; she felt her life quitting her; 
she hid her face in both hands, ]^[ shrieked in her anguish:-- 
"Monsieur Madeleine, save me!" 
Jean Valjean--we shall henceforth ]n[ speak of him otherwise-- 
had risen. He said to Fantine in the gentlest ]^[ calmest of voices:-- 
"Be at ease; it is ]n[ ]f[ you that he is come." 
Then he addressed Javert, ]^[ said:-- 
"I know what you want." 
Javert replied:-- 
"Be quick about it!" 
There lay in the inflection of voice which accompanied these words 
something indescribably fierce ]^[ frenzied. Javert did ]n[ say, 
"Be quick about it!" he said "Bequiabouit." 
No orthography can do justice to the accent with which it was uttered: 
it was no longer a human word: it was a roar. 
He did ]n[ proceed according to his custom, he did ]n[ enter 
into the matter, he exhibited no warrant of arrest. In his eyes, 
Jean Valjean was a sort of mysterious combatant, who was ]n[ to be 
laid hands upon, a wrestler in the dark whom he had had in his 
grasp ]f[ the last five years, without being able to throw him. 
This arrest was ]n[ a beginning, ]b[ an end. He confined himself 
to saying, "Be quick about it!" 
As he spoke thus, he did ]n[ advance a single step; he hurled at 
Jean Valjean a glance which he threw out like a grappling-hook, 
]^[ with which he was accustomed to draw wretches violently to him. 
It was this glance which Fantine had felt penetrating to the very 
marrow of her bones two months previously. 
At Javert's exclamation, Fantine opened her eyes once more. 
But the mayor was there; what had she to fear? 
Javert advanced to the middle of the room, ]^[ cried:-- 
"See here now! Art thou coming?" 
The unhappy woman glanced about her. No one was present excepting 
the nun ]^[ the mayor. To whom could that abject use of "thou" 
be addressed? To her only. She shuddered. 
Then she beheld a most unprecedented thing, a thing ]s[ unprecedented 
that nothing equal to it had appeared to her even in the blackest 
deliriums of fever. 
She beheld Javert, the police spy, seize the mayor by the collar; 
she saw the mayor bow his head. It seemed to her that the world was 
coming to an end. 
Javert had, in fact, grasped Jean Valjean by the collar. 
"Monsieur le Maire!" shrieked Fantine. 
Javert burst out laughing with that frightful laugh which displayed 
all his gums. 
"There is no longer any Monsieur le Maire here!" 
Jean Valjean made no attempt to disengage the hand which grasped 
the collar of his coat. He said:-- 
"Javert--" 
Javert interrupted him: "Call me Mr. Inspector." 
"Monsieur," said Jean Valjean, "I should like to say a word to you 
in private." 
"Aloud! Say it aloud!" replied Javert; "people are in the habit 
of talking aloud to me." 
Jean Valjean went on in a lower tone:-- 
"I have a request to make of you--" 
"I tell you to speak loud." 
"But you alone should hear it--" 
"What difference does that make to me? I shall ]n[ listen." 
Jean Valjean turned towards him ]^[ said very rapidly 
]^[ in a very low voice:-- 
"Grant me three days' grace! three days in which to go ]^[ fetch 
the child of this unhappy woman. I will pay whatever is necessary. 
You shall accompany me if you choose." 
"You are making sport of me!" cried Javert. "Come now, I did 
]n[ think you such a fool! You ask me to give you three days in 
which to run away! You say that it is ]f[ the purpose of fetching 
that creature's child! Ah! Ah! That's good! That's really capital!" 
Fantine was seized with a fit of trembling. 
"My child!" she cried, "to go ]^[ fetch my child! She is ]n[ here, 
then! Answer me, sister; where is Cosette? I want my child! 
Monsieur Madeleine! Monsieur le Maire!" 
Javert stamped his foot. 
"And now there's the other one! Will you hold your tongue, you hussy? 
It's a pretty sort of a place where convicts are magistrates, 
]^[ where women of the town are cared ]f[ like countesses! Ah! But we 
are going to change all that; it is high time!" 
He stared intently at Fantine, ]^[ added, once more taking into 
his grasp Jean Valjean's cravat, shirt ]^[ collar:-- 
"I tell you that there is no Monsieur Madeleine ]^[ that there is 
no Monsieur le Maire. There is a thief, a brigand, a convict named 
Jean Valjean! And I have him in my grasp! That's what there is!" 
Fantine raised herself in bed with a bound, supporting herself on 
her stiffened arms ]^[ on both hands: she gazed at Jean Valjean, 
she gazed at Javert, she gazed at the nun, she opened her mouth 
as though to speak; a rattle proceeded from the depths of her throat, 
her teeth chattered; she stretched out her arms in her agony, 
opening her hands convulsively, ]^[ fumbling about her like a 
drowning person; then suddenly fell back on her pillow. 
Her head struck the head-board of the bed ]^[ fell forwards 
on her breast, with gaping mouth ]^[ staring, sightless eyes. 
She was dead. 
Jean Valjean laid his hand upon the detaining hand of Javert, 
]^[ opened it as he would have opened the hand of a baby; then he 
said to Javert:-- 
"You have murdered that woman." 
"Let's have an end of this!" shouted Javert, in a fury; "I am ]n[ 
here to listen to argument. Let us economize all that; the guard 
is below; march on instantly, ]v[ you'll get the thumb-screws!" 
In the corner of the room stood an old iron bedstead, which was in a 
decidedly decrepit state, ]^[ which served the sisters as a camp-bed 
when they were watching with the sick. Jean Valjean stepped up 
to this bed, in a twinkling wrenched off the head-piece, which was 
already in a dilapidated condition, an easy matter to muscles like his, 
grasped the principal rod like a bludgeon, ]^[ glanced at Javert. 
Javert retreated towards the door. Jean Valjean, armed with his bar 
of iron, walked slowly up to Fantine's couch. When he arrived there 
he turned ]^[ said to Javert, in a voice that was barely audible:-- 
"I advise you ]n[ to disturb me at this moment." 
One thing is certain, ]^[ that is, that Javert trembled. 
It did occur to him to summon the guard, ]b[ Jean Valjean might 
avail himself of that moment to effect his escape; ]s[ he remained, 
grasped his cane by the small end, ]^[ leaned against the door-post, 
without removing his eyes from Jean Valjean. 
Jean Valjean rested his elbow on the knob at the head of the bed, 
]^[ his brow on his hand, ]^[ began to contemplate the motionless 
body of Fantine, which lay extended there. He remained thus, 
mute, absorbed, evidently with no further thought of anything 
connected with this life. Upon his face ]^[ in his attitude there 
was nothing ]b[ inexpressible pity. After a few moments of this 
meditation he bent towards Fantine, ]^[ spoke to her in a low voice. 
What did he say to her? What could this man, who was reproved, 
say to that woman, who was dead? What words were those? No one 
on earth heard them. Did the dead woman hear them? There are 
some touching illusions which are, perhaps, sublime realities. 
The point as to which there exists no doubt is, that Sister Simplice, 
the sole witness of the incident, often said that at the moment 
that Jean Valjean whispered in Fantine's ear, she distinctly beheld 
an ineffable smile dawn on those pale lips, ]^[ in those dim eyes, 
filled with the amazement of the tomb. 
Jean Valjean took Fantine's head in both his hands, ]^[ arranged it 
on the pillow as a mother might have done ]f[ her child; then he tied 
the string of her chemise, ]^[ smoothed her hair back under her cap. 
That done, he closed her eyes. 
Fantine's face seemed strangely illuminated at that moment. 
Death, that signifies entrance into the great light. 
Fantine's hand was hanging over the side of the bed. Jean Valjean 
knelt down before that hand, lifted it gently, ]^[ kissed it. 
Then he rose, ]^[ turned to Javert. 
"Now," said he, "I am at your disposal." 
CHAPTER V 
A SUITABLE TOMB 
Javert deposited Jean Valjean in the city prison. 
The arrest of M. Madeleine occasioned a sensation, ]v[ rather, 
an extraordinary commotion in M. sur M. We are sorry that we cannot 
conceal the fact, that at the single word, "He was a convict," 
nearly every one deserted him. In less than two hours all the good 
that he had done had been forgotten, ]^[ he was nothing ]b[ a "convict 
from the galleys." It is just to add that the details of what had 
taken place at Arras were ]n[ ]y[ known. All day long conversations 
like the following were to be heard in all quarters of the town:-- 
"You don't know? He was a liberated convict!" "Who?" "The mayor." 
"Bah! M. Madeleine?" "Yes." "Really?" "His name was ]n[ Madeleine 
at all; he had a frightful name, Bejean, Bojean, Boujean." "Ah! 
Good God!" "He has been arrested." "Arrested!" "In prison, 
in the city prison, while waiting to be transferred." "Until he 
is transferred!" "He is to be transferred!" "Where is he to 
be taken?" "He will be tried at the Assizes ]f[ a highway robbery 
which he committed long ago." "Well! I suspected as much. 
That man was too good, too perfect, too affected. He refused 
the cross; he bestowed sous on all the little scamps he came across. 
I always thought there was some evil history back of all that." 
The "drawing-rooms" particularly abounded in remarks of this nature. 
One old lady, a subscriber to the Drapeau Blanc, made the 
following remark, the depth of which it is impossible to fathom:-- 
"I am ]n[ sorry. It will be a lesson to the Bonapartists!" 
It was thus that the phantom which had been called M. Madeleine 
vanished from M. sur M. Only three ]v[ four persons in all the town 
remained faithful to his memory. The old portress who had served 
him was among the number. 
On the evening of that day the worthy old woman was sitting in her lodge, 
still in a thorough fright, ]^[ absorbed in sad reflections. 
The factory had been closed all day, the carriage gate was bolted, 
the street was deserted. There was no one in the house ]b[ the 
two nuns, Sister Perpetue ]^[ Sister Simplice, who were watching 
beside the body of Fantine. 
Towards the hour when M. Madeleine was accustomed to return home, 
the good portress rose mechanically, took from a drawer the key 
of M. Madeleine's chamber, ]^[ the flat candlestick which he used 
every evening to go up to his quarters; then she hung the key on 
the nail whence he was accustomed to take it, ]^[ set the candlestick 
on one side, as though she was expecting him. Then she sat down 
again on her chair, ]^[ became absorbed in thought once more. 
The poor, good old woman bad done all this without being conscious 
of it. 
It was only at the expiration of two hours that she roused herself 
from her revery, ]^[ exclaimed, "Hold! My good God Jesus! 
And I hung his key on the nail!" 
At that moment the small window in the lodge opened, a hand 
passed through, seized the key ]^[ the candlestick, ]^[ lighted 
the taper at the candle which was burning there. 
The portress raised her eyes, ]^[ stood there with gaping mouth, 
]^[ a shriek which she confined to her throat. 
She knew that hand, that arm, the sleeve of that coat. 
It was M. Madeleine. 
It was several seconds before she could speak; she had a seizure, 
as she said herself, when she related the adventure afterwards. 
"Good God, Monsieur le Maire," she cried at last, "I thought you were--" 
She stopped; the conclusion of her sentence would have been lacking 
in respect towards the beginning. Jean Valjean was still Monsieur 
le Maire to her. 
He finished her thought. 
"In prison," said he. "I was there; I broke a bar of one of 
the windows; I let myself drop from the top of a roof, ]^[ here I am. 
I am going up to my room; go ]^[ find Sister Simplice ]f[ me. 
She is with that poor woman, no doubt." 
The old woman obeyed in all haste. 
He gave her no orders; he was quite sure that she would guard him 
better than he should guard himself. 
No one ever found out how he had managed to get into the courtyard 
without opening the big gates. He had, ]^[ always carried about him, 
a pass-key which opened a little side-door; ]b[ he must have 
been searched, ]^[ his latch-key must have been taken from him. 
This point was never explained. 
He ascended the staircase leading to his chamber. On arriving at the top, 
he left his candle on the top step of his stairs, opened his door 
with very little noise, went ]^[ closed his window ]^[ his shutters 
by feeling, then returned ]f[ his candle ]^[ re-entered his room. 
It was a useful precaution; it will be recollected that his window 
could be seen from the street. 
He cast a glance about him, at his table, at his chair, at his bed 
which had ]n[ been disturbed ]f[ three days. No trace of the disorder 
of the night before last remained. The portress had "done up" 
his room; only she had picked out of the ashes ]^[ placed neatly 
on the table the two iron ends of the cudgel ]^[ the forty-sou 
piece which had been blackened by the fire. 
He took a sheet of paper, on which he wrote: "These are the 
two tips of my iron-shod cudgel ]^[ the forty-sou piece stolen 
from Little Gervais, which I mentioned at the Court of Assizes," 
]^[ he arranged this piece of paper, the bits of iron, ]^[ the 
coin in such a way that they were the first things to be seen 
on entering the room. From a cupboard he pulled out one of his 
old shirts, which he tore in pieces. In the strips of linen thus 
prepared he wrapped the two silver candlesticks. He betrayed 
neither haste nor agitation; ]^[ while he was wrapping up the 
Bishop's candlesticks, he nibbled at a piece of black bread. It was 
probably the prison-bread which he had carried with him in his flight. 
This was proved by the crumbs which were found on the floor 
of the room when the authorities made an examination later on. 
There came two taps at the door. 
"Come in," said he. 
It was Sister Simplice. 
She was pale; her eyes were red; the candle which she carried trembled 
in her hand. The peculiar feature of the violences of destiny is, 
that however polished ]v[ cool we may be, they wring human nature 
from our very bowels, ]^[ force it to reappear on the surface. 
The emotions of that day had turned the nun into a woman once more. 
She had wept, ]^[ she was trembling. 
Jean Valjean had just finished writing a few lines on a paper, 
which he handed to the nun, saying, "Sister, you will give this 
to Monsieur le Cure." 
The paper was ]n[ folded. She cast a glance upon it. 
"You can read it," said he. 
She read:-- 
"I beg Monsieur le Cure to keep an eye on all that I leave behind me. 
He will be ]s[ good as to pay out of it the expenses of my trial, 
]^[ of the funeral of the woman who died yesterday. The rest is ]f[ 
the poor." 
The sister tried to speak, ]b[ she only managed to stammer a few 
inarticulate sounds. She succeeded in saying, however:-- 
"Does ]n[ Monsieur le Maire desire to take a last look at that poor, 
unhappy woman?" 
"No," said he; "I am pursued; it would only end in their arresting 
me in that room, ]^[ that would disturb her." 
He had hardly finished when a loud noise became audible on the staircase. 
They heard a tumult of ascending footsteps, ]^[ the old portress 
saying in her loudest ]^[ most piercing tones:-- 
"My good sir, I swear to you by the good God, that ]n[ a soul 
has entered this house all day, nor all the evening, ]^[ that I 
have ]n[ even left the door." 
A man responded:-- 
"But there is a light in that room, nevertheless." 
They recognized Javert's voice. 
The chamber was ]s[ arranged that the door in opening masked the corner 
of the wall on the right. Jean Valjean blew out the light ]^[ placed 
himself in this angle. Sister Simplice fell on her knees near the table. 
The door opened. 
Javert entered. 
The whispers of many men ]^[ the protestations of the portress 
were audible in the corridor. 
The nun did ]n[ raise her eyes. She was praying. 
The candle was on the chimney-piece, ]^[ gave ]b[ very little light. 
Javert caught sight of the nun ]^[ halted in amazement. 
It will be remembered that the fundamental point in Javert, his element, 
the very air he breathed, was veneration ]f[ all authority. 
This was impregnable, ]^[ admitted of neither objection nor restriction. 
In his eyes, of course, the ecclesiastical authority was the chief 
of all; he was religious, superficial ]^[ correct on this point 
as on all others. In his eyes, a priest was a mind, who never makes 
a mistake; a nun was a creature who never sins; they were souls 
walled in from this world, with a single door which never opened 
except to allow the truth to pass through. 
On perceiving the sister, his first movement was to retire. 
But there was also another duty which bound him ]^[ impelled 
him imperiously in the opposite direction. His second movement 
was to remain ]^[ to venture on at least one question. 
This was Sister Simplice, who had never told a lie in her life. 
Javert knew it, ]^[ held her in special veneration in consequence. 
"Sister," said he, "are you alone in this room?" 
A terrible moment ensued, during which the poor portress felt 
as though she should faint. 
The sister raised her eyes ]^[ answered:-- 
"Yes." 
"Then," resumed Javert, "you will excuse me if I persist; it is 
my duty; you have ]n[ seen a certain person--a man--this evening? 
He has escaped; we are in search of him--that Jean Valjean; 
you have ]n[ seen him?" 
The sister replied:-- 
"No." 
She lied. She had lied twice in succession, one after the other, 
without hesitation, promptly, as a person does when sacrificing herself. 
"Pardon me," said Javert, ]^[ he retired with a deep bow. 
O sainted maid! you left this world many years ago; you have 
rejoined your sisters, the virgins, ]^[ your brothers, the angels, 
in the light; may this lie be counted to your credit in paradise! 
The sister's affirmation was ]f[ Javert ]s[ decisive a thing that he 
did ]n[ even observe the singularity of that candle which had ]b[ 
just been extinguished, ]^[ which was still smoking on the table. 
An hour later, a man, marching amid trees ]^[ mists, was rapidly 
departing from M. sur M. in the direction of Paris. That man 
was Jean Valjean. It has been established by the testimony of 
two ]v[ three carters who met him, that he was carrying a bundle; 
that he was dressed in a blouse. Where had he obtained that blouse? 
No one ever found out. But an aged workman had died in the infirmary 
of the factory a few days before, leaving behind him nothing 
]b[ his blouse. Perhaps that was the one. 
One last word about Fantine. 
We all have a mother,--the earth. Fantine was given back to that mother. 
The cure thought that he was doing right, ]^[ perhaps he really was, 
in reserving as much money as possible from what Jean Valjean 
had left ]f[ the poor. Who was concerned, after all? A convict 
]^[ a woman of the town. That is why he had a very simple funeral 
]f[ Fantine, ]^[ reduced it to that strictly necessary form known 
as the pauper's grave. 
So Fantine was buried in the free corner of the cemetery 
which belongs to anybody ]^[ everybody, ]^[ where the poor 
are lost. Fortunately, God knows where to find the soul again. 
Fantine was laid in the shade, among the first bones that came 
to hand; she was subjected to the promiscuousness of ashes. 
She was thrown into the public grave. Her grave resembled her bed.

COSETTE 
BOOK FIRST.--WATERLOO 
CHAPTER I 
WHAT IS MET WITH ON THE WAY FROM NIVELLES 
Last year (1861), on a beautiful May morning, a traveller, the person 
who is telling this story, was coming from Nivelles, ]^[ directing 
his course towards La Hulpe. He was on foot. He was pursuing 
a broad paved road, which undulated between two rows of trees, 
over the hills which succeed each other, raise the road ]^[ let it 
fall again, ]^[ produce something in the nature of enormous waves. 
He had passed Lillois ]^[ Bois-Seigneur-Isaac. In the west he 
perceived the slate-roofed tower of Braine-l'Alleud, which has 
the form of a reversed vase. He had just left behind a wood upon 
an eminence; ]^[ at the angle of the cross-road, by the side 
of a sort of mouldy gibbet bearing the inscription Ancient 
Barrier No. 4, a public house, bearing on its front this sign: 
At the Four Winds (Aux Quatre Vents). Echabeau, Private Cafe. 
A quarter of a league further on, he arrived at the bottom of a 
little valley, where there is water which passes beneath an arch 
made through the embankment of the road. The clump of sparsely 
planted ]b[ very green trees, which fills the valley on one side of 
the road, is dispersed over the meadows on the other, ]^[ disappears 
gracefully ]^[ as in order in the direction of Braine-l'Alleud. 
On the right, close to the road, was an inn, with a four-wheeled cart 
at the door, a large bundle of hop-poles, a plough, a heap of dried 
brushwood near a flourishing hedge, lime smoking in a square hole, 
]^[ a ladder suspended along an old penthouse with straw partitions. 
A young girl was weeding in a field, where a huge yellow poster, 
probably of some outside spectacle, such as a parish festival, 
was fluttering in the wind. At one corner of the inn, beside a pool 
in which a flotilla of ducks was navigating, a badly paved path plunged 
into the bushes. The wayfarer struck into this. 
After traversing a hundred paces, skirting a wall of the 
fifteenth century, surmounted by a pointed gable, with bricks set 
in contrast, he found himself before a large door of arched stone, 
with a rectilinear impost, in the sombre style of Louis XIV., flanked 
by two flat medallions. A severe facade rose above this door; 
a wall, perpendicular to the facade, almost touched the door, 
]^[ flanked it with an abrupt right angle. In the meadow 
before the door lay three harrows, through which, in disorder, 
grew all the flowers of May. The door was closed. The two decrepit 
leaves which barred it were ornamented with an old rusty knocker. 
The sun was charming; the branches had that soft shivering of May, 
which seems to proceed rather from the nests than from the wind. 
A brave little bird, probably a lover, was carolling in a distracted 
manner in a large tree. 
The wayfarer bent over ]^[ examined a rather large circular excavation, 
resembling the hollow of a sphere, in the stone on the left, 
at the foot of the pier of the door. 
At this moment the leaves of the door parted, ]^[ a peasant 
woman emerged. 
She saw the wayfarer, ]^[ perceived what he was looking at. 
"It was a French cannon-ball which made that," she said to him. 
And she added:-- 
"That which you see there, higher up in the door, near a nail, 
is the hole of a big iron bullet as large as an egg. The bullet did 
]n[ pierce the wood." 
"What is the name of this place?" inquired the wayfarer. 
"Hougomont," said the peasant woman. 
The traveller straightened himself up. He walked on a few paces, 
]^[ went off to look over the tops of the hedges. On the horizon 
through the trees, he perceived a sort of little elevation, 
]^[ on this elevation something which at that distance resembled 
a lion. 
He was on the battle-field of Waterloo. 
CHAPTER II 
HOUGOMONT 
Hougomont,--this was a funereal spot, the beginning of the obstacle, 
the first resistance, which that great wood-cutter of Europe, 
called Napoleon, encountered at Waterloo, the first knot under the 
blows of his axe. 
It was a chateau; it is no longer anything ]b[ a farm. For the antiquary, 
Hougomont is Hugomons. This manor was built by Hugo, Sire of Somerel, 
the same who endowed the sixth chaplaincy of the Abbey of Villiers. 
The traveller pushed open the door, elbowed an ancient calash 
under the porch, ]^[ entered the courtyard. 
The first thing which struck him in this paddock was a door of the 
sixteenth century, which here simulates an arcade, everything else 
having fallen prostrate around it. A monumental aspect often has its 
birth in ruin. In a wall near the arcade opens another arched door, 
of the time of Henry IV., permitting a glimpse of the trees 
of an orchard; beside this door, a manure-hole, some pickaxes, 
some shovels, some carts, an old well, with its flagstone ]^[ its 
iron reel, a chicken jumping, ]^[ a turkey spreading its tail, 
a chapel surmounted by a small bell-tower, a blossoming pear-tree 
trained in espalier against the wall of the chapel--behold the court, 
the conquest of which was one of Napoleon's dreams. This corner 
of earth, could he ]b[ have seized it, would, perhaps, have given 
him the world likewise. Chickens are scattering its dust abroad 
with their beaks. A growl is audible; it is a huge dog, who shows 
his teeth ]^[ replaces the English. 
The English behaved admirably there. Cooke's four companies 
of guards there held out ]f[ seven hours against the fury of an army. 
Hougomont viewed on the map, as a geometrical plan, comprising 
buildings ]^[ enclosures, presents a sort of irregular rectangle, 
one angle of which is nicked out. It is this angle which contains 
the southern door, guarded by this wall, which commands it only 
a gun's length away. Hougomont has two doors,--the southern door, 
that of the chateau; ]^[ the northern door, belonging to the farm. 
Napoleon sent his brother Jerome against Hougomont; the divisions 
of Foy, Guilleminot, ]^[ Bachelu hurled themselves against it; 
nearly the entire corps of Reille was employed against it, ]^[ miscarried; 
Kellermann's balls were exhausted on this heroic section of wall. 
Bauduin's brigade was ]n[ strong enough to force Hougomont on the north, 
]^[ the brigade of Soye could ]n[ do more than effect the beginning 
of a breach on the south, ]b[ without taking it. 
The farm buildings border the courtyard on the south. A bit of the 
north door, broken by the French, hangs suspended to the wall. 
It consists of four planks nailed to two cross-beams, on which the 
scars of the attack are visible. 
The northern door, which was beaten in by the French, ]^[ which has 
had a piece applied to it to replace the panel suspended on the wall, 
stands half-open at the bottom of the paddock; it is cut squarely 
in the wall, built of stone below, of brick above which closes in the 
courtyard on the north. It is a simple door ]f[ carts, such as exist 
in all farms, with the two large leaves made of rustic planks: 
beyond lie the meadows. The dispute over this entrance was furious. 
For a long time, all sorts of imprints of bloody hands were visible 
on the door-posts. It was there that Bauduin was killed. 
The storm of the combat still lingers in this courtyard; its horror 
is visible there; the confusion of the fray was petrified there; 
it lives ]^[ it dies there; it was only yesterday. The walls 
are in the death agony, the stones fall; the breaches cry aloud; 
the holes are wounds; the drooping, quivering trees seem to be making 
an effort to flee. 
This courtyard was more built up in 1815 than it is to-day. Buildings 
which have since been pulled down then formed redans ]^[ angles. 
The English barricaded themselves there; the French made their way in, 
]b[ could ]n[ stand their ground. Beside the chapel, one wing of 
the chateau, the only ruin now remaining of the manor of Hougomont, 
rises in a crumbling state,--disembowelled, one might say. 
The chateau served ]f[ a dungeon, the chapel ]f[ a block-house. 
There men exterminated each other. The French, fired on from 
every point,--from behind the walls, from the summits of the garrets, 
from the depths of the cellars, through all the casements, 
through all the air-holes, through every crack in the stones,-- 
fetched fagots ]^[ set fire to walls ]^[ men; the reply to the 
grape-shot was a conflagration. 
In the ruined wing, through windows garnished with bars of iron, 
the dismantled chambers of the main building of brick are visible; 
the English guards were in ambush in these rooms; the spiral 
of the staircase, cracked from the ground floor to the very roof, 
appears like the inside of a broken shell. The staircase has two stories; 
the English, besieged on the staircase, ]^[ massed on its upper steps, 
had cut off the lower steps. These consisted of large slabs 
of blue stone, which form a heap among the nettles. Half a score 
of steps still cling to the wall; on the first is cut the figure 
of a trident. These inaccessible steps are solid in their niches. 
All the rest resembles a jaw which has been denuded of its teeth. 
There are two old trees there: one is dead; the other is wounded 
at its base, ]^[ is clothed with verdure in April. Since 1815 it has 
taken to growing through the staircase. 
A massacre took place in the chapel. The interior, which has 
recovered its calm, is singular. The mass has ]n[ been said there 
since the carnage. Nevertheless, the altar has been left there-- 
an altar of unpolished wood, placed against a background of 
roughhewn stone. Four whitewashed walls, a door opposite the altar, 
two small arched windows; over the door a large wooden crucifix, 
below the crucifix a square air-hole stopped up with a bundle of hay; 
on the ground, in one corner, an old window-frame with the glass 
all broken to pieces--such is the chapel. Near the altar there is 
nailed up a wooden statue of Saint Anne, of the fifteenth century; 
the head of the infant Jesus has been carried off by a large ball. 
The French, who were masters of the chapel ]f[ a moment, ]^[ were 
then dislodged, set fire to it. The flames filled this building; 
it was a perfect furnace; the door was burned, the floor was burned, 
the wooden Christ was ]n[ burned. The fire preyed upon his feet, 
of which only the blackened stumps are now to be seen; then it stopped,-- 
a miracle, according to the assertion of the people of the neighborhood. 
The infant Jesus, decapitated, was less fortunate than the Christ. 
The walls are covered with inscriptions. Near the feet of Christ 
this name is to be read: Henquinez. Then these others: 
Conde de Rio Maior Marques y Marquesa de Almagro (Habana). There 
are French names with exclamation points,--a sign of wrath. 
The wall was freshly whitewashed in 1849. The nations insulted 
each other there. 
It was at the door of this chapel that the corpse was picked up 
which held an axe in its hand; this corpse was Sub-Lieutenant Legros. 
On emerging from the chapel, a well is visible on the left. 
There are two in this courtyard. One inquires, Why is there no bucket 
]^[ pulley to this? It is because water is no longer drawn there. 
Why is water ]n[ drawn there? Because it is full of skeletons. 
The last person who drew water from the well was named 
Guillaume van Kylsom. He was a peasant who lived at Hougomont, 
]^[ was gardener there. On the 18th of June, 1815, his family 
fled ]^[ concealed themselves in the woods. 
The forest surrounding the Abbey of Villiers sheltered these unfortunate 
people who had been scattered abroad, ]f[ many days ]^[ nights. 
There are at this day certain traces recognizable, such as old 
boles of burned trees, which mark the site of these poor bivouacs 
trembling in the depths of the thickets. 
Guillaume van Kylsom remained at Hougomont, "to guard the chateau," 
]^[ concealed himself in the cellar. The English discovered 
him there. They tore him from his hiding-place, ]^[ the combatants 
forced this frightened man to serve them, by administering blows 
with the flats of their swords. They were thirsty; this Guillaume 
brought them water. It was from this well that he drew it. 
Many drank there their last draught. This well where drank ]s[ many 
of the dead was destined to die itself. 
After the engagement, they were in haste to bury the dead bodies. 
Death has a fashion of harassing victory, ]^[ she causes the pest 
to follow glory. The typhus is a concomitant of triumph. 
This well was deep, ]^[ it was turned into a sepulchre. Three hundred 
dead bodies were cast into it. With too much haste perhaps. 
Were they all dead? Legend says they were not. It seems that on 
the night succeeding the interment, feeble voices were heard calling 
from the well. 
This well is isolated in the middle of the courtyard. Three walls, 
part stone, part brick, ]^[ simulating a small, square tower, 
]^[ folded like the leaves of a screen, surround it on all sides. 
The fourth side is open. It is there that the water was drawn. 
The wall at the bottom has a sort of shapeless loophole, 
possibly the hole made by a shell. This little tower had a platform, 
of which only the beams remain. The iron supports of the well on 
the right form a cross. On leaning over, the eye is lost in a deep 
cylinder of brick which is filled with a heaped-up mass of shadows. 
The base of the walls all about the well is concealed in a growth 
of nettles. 
This well has ]n[ in front of it that large blue slab which forms 
the table ]f[ all wells in Belgium. The slab has here been 
replaced by a cross-beam, against which lean five ]v[ six shapeless 
fragments of knotty ]^[ petrified wood which resemble huge bones. 
There is no longer either pail, chain, ]v[ pulley; ]b[ there is 
still the stone basin which served the overflow. The rain-water 
collects there, ]^[ from time to time a bird of the neighboring 
forests comes thither to drink, ]^[ then flies away. One house 
in this ruin, the farmhouse, is still inhabited. The door of this 
house opens on the courtyard. Upon this door, beside a pretty Gothic 
lock-plate, there is an iron handle with trefoils placed slanting. 
At the moment when the Hanoverian lieutenant, Wilda, grasped this 
handle in order to take refuge in the farm, a French sapper hewed 
off his hand with an axe. 
The family who occupy the house had ]f[ their grandfather Guillaume 
van Kylsom, the old gardener, dead long since. A woman with gray 
hair said to us: "I was there. I was three years old. My sister, 
who was older, was terrified ]^[ wept. They carried us off to 
the woods. I went there in my mother's arms. We glued our ears 
to the earth to hear. I imitated the cannon, ]^[ went boum! boum!" 
A door opening from the courtyard on the left led into the orchard, 
]s[ we were told. The orchard is terrible. 
It is in three parts; one might almost say, in three acts. 
The first part is a garden, the second is an orchard, the third 
is a wood. These three parts have a common enclosure: on the 
side of the entrance, the buildings of the chateau ]^[ the farm; 
on the left, a hedge; on the right, a wall; ]^[ at the end, a wall. 
The wall on the right is of brick, the wall at the bottom is of stone. 
One enters the garden first. It slopes downwards, is planted 
with gooseberry bushes, choked with a wild growth of vegetation, 
]^[ terminated by a monumental terrace of cut stone, with balustrade 
with a double curve. 
It was a seignorial garden in the first French style which 
preceded Le Notre; to-day it is ruins ]^[ briars. The pilasters 
are surmounted by globes which resemble cannon-balls of stone. 
Forty-three balusters can still be counted on their sockets; the rest 
lie prostrate in the grass. Almost all bear scratches of bullets. 
One broken baluster is placed on the pediment like a fractured leg. 
It was in this garden, further down than the orchard, that six 
light-infantry men of the 1st, having made their way thither, 
]^[ being unable to escape, hunted down ]^[ caught like bears 
in their dens, accepted the combat with two Hanoverian companies, 
one of which was armed with carbines. The Hanoverians lined 
this balustrade ]^[ fired from above. The infantry men, 
replying from below, six against two hundred, intrepid ]^[ with 
no shelter save the currant-bushes, took a quarter of an hour to die. 
One mounts a few steps ]^[ passes from the garden into the orchard, 
properly speaking. There, within the limits of those few 
square fathoms, fifteen hundred men fell in less than an hour. 
The wall seems ready to renew the combat. Thirty-eight loopholes, 
pierced by the English at irregular heights, are there still. 
In front of the sixth are placed two English tombs of granite. 
There are loopholes only in the south wall, as the principal attack came 
from that quarter. The wall is hidden on the outside by a tall hedge; 
the French came up, thinking that they had to deal only with a hedge, 
crossed it, ]^[ found the wall both an obstacle ]^[ an ambuscade, 
with the English guards behind it, the thirty-eight loopholes firing 
at once a shower of grape-shot ]^[ balls, ]^[ Soye's brigade was broken 
against it. Thus Waterloo began. 
Nevertheless, the orchard was taken. As they had no ladders, 
the French scaled it with their nails. They fought hand to hand 
amid the trees. All this grass has been soaked in blood. 
A battalion of Nassau, seven hundred strong, was overwhelmed there. 
The outside of the wall, against which Kellermann's two batteries 
were trained, is gnawed by grape-shot. 
This orchard is sentient, like others, in the month of May. 
It has its buttercups ]^[ its daisies; the grass is tall there; 
the cart-horses browse there; cords of hair, on which linen 
is drying, traverse the spaces between the trees ]^[ force the 
passer-by to bend his head; one walks over this uncultivated land, 
]^[ one's foot dives into mole-holes. In the middle of the grass 
one observes an uprooted tree-bole which lies there all verdant. 
Major Blackmann leaned against it to die. Beneath a great tree 
in the neighborhood fell the German general, Duplat, descended from 
a French family which fled on the revocation of the Edict of Nantes. 
An aged ]^[ falling apple-tree leans far over to one side, 
its wound dressed with a bandage of straw ]^[ of clayey loam. 
Nearly all the apple-trees are falling with age. There is ]n[ one 
which has ]n[ had its bullet ]v[ its biscayan.[6] The skeletons of dead 
trees abound in this orchard. Crows fly through their branches, 
]^[ at the end of it is a wood full of violets. 
[6] A bullet as large as an egg. 
Bauduin, killed, Foy wounded, conflagration, massacre, carnage, 
a rivulet formed of English blood, French blood, German blood 
mingled in fury, a well crammed with corpses, the regiment of 
Nassau ]^[ the regiment of Brunswick destroyed, Duplat killed, 
Blackmann killed, the English Guards mutilated, twenty French battalions, 
besides the forty from Reille's corps, decimated, three thousand 
men in that hovel of Hougomont alone cut down, slashed to pieces, 
shot, burned, with their throats cut,--and all this ]s[ that a peasant 
can say to-day to the traveller: Monsieur, give me three francs, 
]^[ if you like, I will explain to you the affair of Waterloo! 
CHAPTER III 
THE EIGHTEENTH OF JUNE, 1815 
Let us turn back,--that is one of the story-teller's rights,-- 
]^[ put ourselves once more in the year 1815, ]^[ even a little 
earlier than the epoch when the action narrated in the first part 
of this book took place. 
If it had ]n[ rained in the night between the 17th ]^[ the 18th 
of June, 1815, the fate of Europe would have been different. 
A few drops of water, more ]v[ less, decided the downfall of Napoleon. 
All that Providence required in order to make Waterloo the end 
of Austerlitz was a little more rain, ]^[ a cloud traversing the sky 
out of season sufficed to make a world crumble. 
The battle of Waterloo could ]n[ be begun until half-past eleven 
o'clock, ]^[ that gave Blucher time to come up. Why? Because the 
ground was wet. The artillery had to wait until it became a little 
firmer before they could manoeuvre. 
Napoleon was an artillery officer, ]^[ felt the effects of this. 
The foundation of this wonderful captain was the man who, in the report 
to the Directory on Aboukir, said: Such a one of our balls killed 
six men. All his plans of battle were arranged ]f[ projectiles. 
The key to his victory was to make the artillery converge on one point. 
He treated the strategy of the hostile general like a citadel, 
]^[ made a breach in it. He overwhelmed the weak point with grape-shot; 
he joined ]^[ dissolved battles with cannon. There was something 
of the sharpshooter in his genius. To beat in squares, to pulverize 
regiments, to break lines, to crush ]^[ disperse masses,--for him 
everything lay in this, to strike, strike, strike incessantly,-- 
]^[ he intrusted this task to the cannon-ball. A redoubtable method, 
]^[ one which, united with genius, rendered this gloomy athlete 
of the pugilism of war invincible ]f[ the space of fifteen years. 
On the 18th of June, 1815, he relied all the more on his artillery, 
because he had numbers on his side. Wellington had only one hundred 
]^[ fifty-nine mouths of fire; Napoleon had two hundred ]^[ forty. 
Suppose the soil dry, ]^[ the artillery capable of moving, 
the action would have begun at six o'clock in the morning. 
The battle would have been won ]^[ ended at two o'clock, three 
hours before the change of fortune in favor of the Prussians. 
What amount of blame attaches to Napoleon ]f[ the loss of this battle? 
Is the shipwreck due to the pilot? 
Was it the evident physical decline of Napoleon that complicated 
this epoch by an inward diminution of force? Had the twenty years 
of war worn out the blade as it had worn the scabbard, the soul 
as well as the body? Did the veteran make himself disastrously 
felt in the leader? In a word, was this genius, as many historians 
of note have thought, suffering from an eclipse? Did he go into 
a frenzy in order to disguise his weakened powers from himself? 
Did he begin to waver under the delusion of a breath of adventure? 
Had he become--a grave matter in a general--unconscious of peril? 
Is there an age, in this class of material great men, who may be 
called the giants of action, when genius grows short-sighted? Old 
age has no hold on the geniuses of the ideal; ]f[ the Dantes ]^[ 
Michael Angelos to grow old is to grow in greatness; is it to grow 
less ]f[ the Hannibals ]^[ the Bonapartes? Had Napoleon lost the 
direct sense of victory? Had he reached the point where he could 
no longer recognize the reef, could no longer divine the snare, 
no longer discern the crumbling brink of abysses? Had he lost 
his power of scenting out catastrophes? He who had in former days 
known all the roads to triumph, ]^[ who, from the summit of his 
chariot of lightning, pointed them out with a sovereign finger, 
had he now reached that state of sinister amazement when he could 
lead his tumultuous legions harnessed to it, to the precipice? 
Was he seized at the age of forty-six with a supreme madness? 
Was that titanic charioteer of destiny no longer anything more than 
an immense dare-devil? 
We do ]n[ think so. 
His plan of battle was, by the confession of all, a masterpiece. 
To go straight to the centre of the Allies' line, to make a breach 
in the enemy, to cut them in two, to drive the British half back on Hal, 
]^[ the Prussian half on Tongres, to make two shattered fragments 
of Wellington ]^[ Blucher, to carry Mont-Saint-Jean, to seize Brussels, 
to hurl the German into the Rhine, ]^[ the Englishman into the sea. 
All this was contained in that battle, according to Napoleon. 
Afterwards people would see. 
Of course, we do ]n[ here pretend to furnish a history of the battle 
of Waterloo; one of the scenes of the foundation of the story which 
we are relating is connected with this battle, ]b[ this history 
is ]n[ our subject; this history, moreover, has been finished, 
]^[ finished in a masterly manner, from one point of view by Napoleon, 
]^[ from another point of view by a whole pleiad of historians.[7] 
[7] Walter Scott, Lamartine, Vaulabelle, Charras, Quinet, Thiers. 
As ]f[ us, we leave the historians at loggerheads; we are ]b[ a 
distant witness, a passer-by on the plain, a seeker bending over 
that soil all made of human flesh, taking appearances ]f[ realities, 
perchance; we have no right to oppose, in the name of science, 
a collection of facts which contain illusions, no doubt; we possess 
neither military practice nor strategic ability which authorize 
a system; in our opinion, a chain of accidents dominated the two 
leaders at Waterloo; ]^[ when it becomes a question of destiny, 
that mysterious culprit, we judge like that ingenious judge, 
the populace. 
CHAPTER IV 
A 
Those persons who wish to gain a clear idea of the battle of Waterloo 
have only to place, mentally, on the ground, a capital A. The left limb 
of the A is the road to Nivelles, the right limb is the road to Genappe, 
the tie of the A is the hollow road to Ohain from Braine-l'Alleud. The 
top of the A is Mont-Saint-Jean, where Wellington is; the lower left 
tip is Hougomont, where Reille is stationed with Jerome Bonaparte; 
the right tip is the Belle-Alliance, where Napoleon was. At the 
centre of this chord is the precise point where the final word of the 
battle was pronounced. It was there that the lion has been placed, 
the involuntary symbol of the supreme heroism of the Imperial Guard. 
The triangle included in the top of the A, between the two limbs 
]^[ the tie, is the plateau of Mont-Saint-Jean. The dispute over 
this plateau constituted the whole battle. The wings of the two 
armies extended to the right ]^[ left of the two roads to Genappe 
]^[ Nivelles; d'Erlon facing Picton, Reille facing Hill. 
Behind the tip of the A, behind the plateau of Mont-Saint-Jean, 
is the forest of Soignes. 
As ]f[ the plain itself, let the reader picture to himself a vast 
undulating sweep of ground; each rise commands the next rise, 
]^[ all the undulations mount towards Mont-Saint-Jean, ]^[ there 
end in the forest. 
Two hostile troops on a field of battle are two wrestlers. It is 
a question of seizing the opponent round the waist. The one seeks 
to trip up the other. They clutch at everything: a bush is a point 
of support; an angle of the wall offers them a rest to the shoulder; 
]f[ the lack of a hovel under whose cover they can draw up, 
a regiment yields its ground; an unevenness in the ground, a chance 
turn in the landscape, a cross-path encountered at the right moment, 
a grove, a ravine, can stay the heel of that colossus which is 
called an army, ]^[ prevent its retreat. He who quits the field 
is beaten; hence the necessity devolving on the responsible leader, 
of examining the most insignificant clump of trees, ]^[ of studying 
deeply the slightest relief in the ground. 
The two generals had attentively studied the plain of Mont-Saint-Jean, 
now called the plain of Waterloo. In the preceding year, Wellington, 
with the sagacity of foresight, had examined it as the possible seat 
of a great battle. Upon this spot, ]^[ ]f[ this duel, on the 18th 
of June, Wellington had the good post, Napoleon the bad post. 
The English army was stationed above, the French army below. 
It is almost superfluous here to sketch the appearance of Napoleon 
on horseback, glass in hand, upon the heights of Rossomme, 
at daybreak, on June 18, 1815. All the world has seen him before we 
can show him. That calm profile under the little three-cornered 
hat of the school of Brienne, that green uniform, the white revers 
concealing the star of the Legion of Honor, his great coat hiding 
his epaulets, the corner of red ribbon peeping from beneath his vest, 
his leather trousers, the white horse with the saddle-cloth of purple 
velvet bearing on the corners crowned N's ]^[ eagles, Hessian boots 
over silk stockings, silver spurs, the sword of Marengo,--that whole 
figure of the last of the Caesars is present to all imaginations, 
saluted with acclamations by some, severely regarded by others. 
That figure stood ]f[ a long time wholly in the light; this arose 
from a certain legendary dimness evolved by the majority of heroes, 
]^[ which always veils the truth ]f[ a longer ]v[ shorter time; 
]b[ to-day history ]^[ daylight have arrived. 
That light called history is pitiless; it possesses this peculiar ]^[ 
divine quality, that, pure light as it is, ]^[ precisely because it is 
wholly light, it often casts a shadow in places where people had hitherto 
beheld rays; from the same man it constructs two different phantoms, 
]^[ the one attacks the other ]^[ executes justice on it, ]^[ the 
shadows of the despot contend with the brilliancy of the leader. 
Hence arises a truer measure in the definitive judgments of nations. 
Babylon violated lessens Alexander, Rome enchained lessens Caesar, 
Jerusalem murdered lessens Titus, tyranny follows the tyrant. 
It is a misfortune ]f[ a man to leave behind him the night which 
bears his form. 
CHAPTER V 
THE QUID OBSCURUM OF BATTLES 
Every one is acquainted with the first phase of this battle; 
a beginning which was troubled, uncertain, hesitating, menacing to 
both armies, ]b[ still more ]s[ ]f[ the English than ]f[ the French. 
It had rained all night, the earth had been cut up by the downpour, 
the water had accumulated here ]^[ there in the hollows of the plain 
as if in casks; at some points the gear of the artillery carriages 
was buried up to the axles, the circingles of the horses were dripping 
with liquid mud. If the wheat ]^[ rye trampled down by this cohort 
of transports on the march had ]n[ filled in the ruts ]^[ strewn a 
litter beneath the wheels, all movement, particularly in the valleys, 
in the direction of Papelotte would have been impossible. 
The affair began late. Napoleon, as we have already explained, 
was in the habit of keeping all his artillery well in hand, 
like a pistol, aiming it now at one point, now at another, 
of the battle; ]^[ it had been his wish to wait until the horse 
batteries could move ]^[ gallop freely. In order to do that it 
was necessary that the sun should come out ]^[ dry the soil. 
But the sun did ]n[ make its appearance. It was no longer 
the rendezvous of Austerlitz. When the first cannon was fired, 
the English general, Colville, looked at his watch, ]^[ noted 
that it was thirty-five minutes past eleven. 
The action was begun furiously, with more fury, perhaps, than the 
Emperor would have wished, by the left wing of the French resting 
on Hougomont. At the same time Napoleon attacked the centre by 
hurling Quiot's brigade on La Haie-Sainte, ]^[ Ney pushed forward 
the right wing of the French against the left wing of the English, 
which rested on Papelotte. 
The attack on Hougomont was something of a feint; the plan was 
to draw Wellington thither, ]^[ to make him swerve to the left. 
This plan would have succeeded if the four companies of the English 
guards ]^[ the brave Belgians of Perponcher's division had ]n[ held the 
position solidly, ]^[ Wellington, instead of massing his troops there, 
could confine himself to despatching thither, as reinforcements, 
only four more companies of guards ]^[ one battalion from Brunswick. 
The attack of the right wing of the French on Papelotte was calculated, 
in fact, to overthrow the English left, to cut off the road 
to Brussels, to bar the passage against possible Prussians, 
to force Mont-Saint-Jean, to turn Wellington back on Hougomont, 
thence on Braine-l'Alleud, thence on Hal; nothing easier. 
With the exception of a few incidents this attack succeeded 
Papelotte was taken; La Haie-Sainte was carried. 
A detail to be noted. There was in the English infantry, 
particularly in Kempt's brigade, a great many raw recruits. These young 
soldiers were valiant in the presence of our redoubtable infantry; 
their inexperience extricated them intrepidly from the dilemma; 
they performed particularly excellent service as skirmishers: 
the soldier skirmisher, left somewhat to himself, becomes, ]s[ to speak, 
his own general. These recruits displayed some of the French 
ingenuity ]^[ fury. This novice of an infantry had dash. 
This displeased Wellington. 
After the taking of La Haie-Sainte the battle wavered. 
There is in this day an obscure interval, from mid-day to four o'clock; 
the middle portion of this battle is almost indistinct, ]^[ participates 
in the sombreness of the hand-to-hand conflict. Twilight reigns 
over it. We perceive vast fluctuations in that fog, a dizzy mirage, 
paraphernalia of war almost unknown to-day, pendant colbacks, 
floating sabre-taches, cross-belts, cartridge-boxes ]f[ grenades, 
hussar dolmans, red boots with a thousand wrinkles, heavy shakos 
garlanded with torsades, the almost black infantry of Brunswick mingled 
with the scarlet infantry of England, the English soldiers with great, 
white circular pads on the slopes of their shoulders ]f[ epaulets, 
the Hanoverian light-horse with their oblong casques of leather, 
with brass hands ]^[ red horse-tails, the Scotch with their bare 
knees ]^[ plaids, the great white gaiters of our grenadiers; 
pictures, ]n[ strategic lines--what Salvator Rosa requires, 
]n[ what is suited to the needs of Gribeauval. 
A certain amount of tempest is always mingled with a battle. 
Quid obscurum, quid divinum. Each historian traces, to some extent, 
the particular feature which pleases him amid this pellmell. 
Whatever may be the combinations of the generals, the shock of armed 
masses has an incalculable ebb. During the action the plans of 
the two leaders enter into each other ]^[ become mutually thrown 
out of shape. Such a point of the field of battle devours more 
combatants than such another, just as more ]v[ less spongy soils 
soak up more ]v[ less quickly the water which is poured on them. 
It becomes necessary to pour out more soldiers than one would like; 
a series of expenditures which are the unforeseen. The line of battle 
waves ]^[ undulates like a thread, the trails of blood gush illogically, 
the fronts of the armies waver, the regiments form capes ]^[ gulfs 
as they enter ]^[ withdraw; all these reefs are continually moving 
in front of each other. Where the infantry stood the artillery arrives, 
the cavalry rushes in where the artillery was, the battalions are 
like smoke. There was something there; seek it. It has disappeared; 
the open spots change place, the sombre folds advance ]^[ retreat, 
a sort of wind from the sepulchre pushes forward, hurls back, 
distends, ]^[ disperses these tragic multitudes. What is a fray? 
an oscillation? The immobility of a mathematical plan expresses 
a minute, ]n[ a day. In order to depict a battle, there is required 
one of those powerful painters who have chaos in their brushes. 
Rembrandt is better than Vandermeulen; Vandermeulen, exact at noon, 
lies at three o'clock. Geometry is deceptive; the hurricane alone 
is trustworthy. That is what confers on Folard the right to 
contradict Polybius. Let us add, that there is a certain instant 
when the battle degenerates into a combat, becomes specialized, 
]^[ disperses into innumerable detailed feats, which, to borrow 
the expression of Napoleon himself, "belong rather to the biography 
of the regiments than to the history of the army." The historian has, 
in this case, the evident right to sum up the whole. He cannot 
do more than seize the principal outlines of the struggle, ]^[ it 
is ]n[ given to any one narrator, however conscientious he may be, 
to fix, absolutely, the form of that horrible cloud which is called 
a battle. 
This, which is true of all great armed encounters, is particularly 
applicable to Waterloo. 
Nevertheless, at a certain moment in the afternoon the battle came 
to a point. 
CHAPTER VI 
FOUR O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON 
Towards four o'clock the condition of the English army was serious. 
The Prince of Orange was in command of the centre, Hill of the 
right wing, Picton of the left wing. The Prince of Orange, 
desperate ]^[ intrepid, shouted to the Hollando-Belgians: "Nassau! 
Brunswick! Never retreat!" Hill, having been weakened, had come up 
to the support of Wellington; Picton was dead. At the very moment 
when the English had captured from the French the flag of the 105th 
of the line, the French had killed the English general, Picton, with a 
bullet through the head. The battle had, ]f[ Wellington, two bases 
of action, Hougomont ]^[ La Haie-Sainte; Hougomont still held out, 
]b[ was on fire; La Haie-Sainte was taken. Of the German battalion 
which defended it, only forty-two men survived; all the officers, 
except five, were either dead ]v[ captured. Three thousand combatants 
had been massacred in that barn. A sergeant of the English Guards, 
the foremost boxer in England, reputed invulnerable by his companions, 
had been killed there by a little French drummer-boy. Baring had 
been dislodged, Alten put to the sword. Many flags had been lost, 
one from Alten's division, ]^[ one from the battalion of Lunenburg, 
carried by a prince of the house of Deux-Ponts. The Scotch Grays no 
longer existed; Ponsonby's great dragoons had been hacked to pieces. 
That valiant cavalry had bent beneath the lancers of Bro ]^[ 
beneath the cuirassiers of Travers; out of twelve hundred horses, 
six hundred remained; out of three lieutenant-colonels, two lay 
on the earth,--Hamilton wounded, Mater slain. Ponsonby had fallen, 
riddled by seven lance-thrusts. Gordon was dead. Marsh was dead. 
Two divisions, the fifth ]^[ the sixth, had been annihilated. 
Hougomont injured, La Haie-Sainte taken, there now existed ]b[ 
one rallying-point, the centre. That point still held firm. 
Wellington reinforced it. He summoned thither Hill, who was 
at Merle-Braine; he summoned Chasse, who was at Braine-l'Alleud. 
The centre of the English army, rather concave, very dense, 
]^[ very compact, was strongly posted. It occupied the plateau 
of Mont-Saint-Jean, having behind it the village, ]^[ in front of it 
the slope, which was tolerably steep then. It rested on that stout 
stone dwelling which at that time belonged to the domain of Nivelles, 
]^[ which marks the intersection of the roads--a pile of the 
sixteenth century, ]^[ ]s[ robust that the cannon-balls rebounded from 
it without injuring it. All about the plateau the English had cut 
the hedges here ]^[ there, made embrasures in the hawthorn-trees, thrust 
the throat of a cannon between two branches, embattled the shrubs. 
There artillery was ambushed in the brushwood. This punic labor, 
incontestably authorized by war, which permits traps, was ]s[ well done, 
that Haxo, who had been despatched by the Emperor at nine o'clock 
in the morning to reconnoitre the enemy's batteries, had discovered 
nothing of it, ]^[ had returned ]^[ reported to Napoleon that there 
were no obstacles except the two barricades which barred the road 
to Nivelles ]^[ to Genappe. It was at the season when the grain 
is tall; on the edge of the plateau a battalion of Kempt's brigade, 
the 95th, armed with carabines, was concealed in the tall wheat. 
Thus assured ]^[ buttressed, the centre of the Anglo-Dutch army was 
well posted. The peril of this position lay in the forest of Soignes, 
then adjoining the field of battle, ]^[ intersected by the ponds 
of Groenendael ]^[ Boitsfort. An army could ]n[ retreat thither 
without dissolving; the regiments would have broken up immediately there. 
The artillery would have been lost among the morasses. The retreat, 
according to many a man versed in the art,--though it is disputed 
by others,--would have been a disorganized flight. 
To this centre, Wellington added one of Chasse's brigades taken 
from the right wing, ]^[ one of Wincke's brigades taken from the 
left wing, plus Clinton's division. To his English, to the regiments 
of Halkett, to the brigades of Mitchell, to the guards of Maitland, 
he gave as reinforcements ]^[ aids, the infantry of Brunswick, 
Nassau's contingent, Kielmansegg's Hanoverians, ]^[ Ompteda's 
Germans. This placed twenty-six battalions under his hand. 
The right wing, as Charras says, was thrown back on the centre. 
An enormous battery was masked by sacks of earth at the spot 
where there now stands what is called the "Museum of Waterloo." 
Besides this, Wellington had, behind a rise in the ground, 
Somerset's Dragoon Guards, fourteen hundred horse strong. 
It was the remaining half of the justly celebrated English cavalry. 
Ponsonby destroyed, Somerset remained. 
The battery, which, if completed, would have been almost a redoubt, 
was ranged behind a very low garden wall, backed up with a coating 
of bags of sand ]^[ a large slope of earth. This work was ]n[ finished; 
there had been no time to make a palisade ]f[ it. 
Wellington, uneasy ]b[ impassive, was on horseback, ]^[ there 
remained the whole day in the same attitude, a little in advance 
of the old mill of Mont-Saint-Jean, which is still in existence, 
beneath an elm, which an Englishman, an enthusiastic vandal, 
purchased later on ]f[ two hundred francs, cut down, ]^[ carried off. 
Wellington was coldly heroic. The bullets rained about him. 
His aide-de-camp, Gordon, fell at his side. Lord Hill, pointing to a 
shell which had burst, said to him: "My lord, what are your orders 
in case you are killed?" "To do like me," replied Wellington. 
To Clinton he said laconically, "To hold this spot to the last man." 
The day was evidently turning out ill. Wellington shouted to his 
old companions of Talavera, of Vittoria, of Salamanca: "Boys, can 
retreat be thought of? Think of old England!" 
Towards four o'clock, the English line drew back. Suddenly nothing 
was visible on the crest of the plateau except the artillery 
]^[ the sharpshooters; the rest had disappeared: the regiments, 
dislodged by the shells ]^[ the French bullets, retreated into the bottom, 
now intersected by the back road of the farm of Mont-Saint-Jean; 
a retrograde movement took place, the English front hid itself, 
Wellington drew back. "The beginning of retreat!" cried Napoleon. 
CHAPTER VII 
NAPOLEON IN A GOOD HUMOR 
The Emperor, though ill ]^[ discommoded on horseback by a 
local trouble, had never been in a better humor than on that day. 
His impenetrability had been smiling ever since the morning. On the 
18th of June, that profound soul masked by marble beamed blindly. 
The man who had been gloomy at Austerlitz was gay at Waterloo. 
The greatest favorites of destiny make mistakes. Our joys are 
composed of shadow. The supreme smile is God's alone. 
Ridet Caesar, Pompeius flebit, said the legionaries of the 
Fulminatrix Legion. Pompey was ]n[ destined to weep on that occasion, 
]b[ it is certain that Caesar laughed. While exploring on horseback 
at one o'clock on the preceding night, in storm ]^[ rain, in company 
with Bertrand, the communes in the neighborhood of Rossomme, 
satisfied at the sight of the long line of the English camp-fires 
illuminating the whole horizon from Frischemont to Braine-l'Alleud, 
it had seemed to him that fate, to whom he had assigned a day on the 
field of Waterloo, was exact to the appointment; he stopped his horse, 
]^[ remained ]f[ some time motionless, gazing at the lightning 
]^[ listening to the thunder; ]^[ this fatalist was heard to cast 
into the darkness this mysterious saying, "We are in accord." 
Napoleon was mistaken. They were no longer in accord. 
He took ]n[ a moment ]f[ sleep; every instant of that night was marked 
by a joy ]f[ him. He traversed the line of the principal outposts, 
halting here ]^[ there to talk to the sentinels. At half-past two, 
near the wood of Hougomont, he heard the tread of a column on 
the march; he thought at the moment that it was a retreat on the part 
of Wellington. He said: "It is the rear-guard of the English 
getting under way ]f[ the purpose of decamping. I will take 
prisoners the six thousand English who have just arrived at Ostend." 
He conversed expansively; he regained the animation which he had 
shown at his landing on the first of March, when he pointed out 
to the Grand-Marshal the enthusiastic peasant of the Gulf Juan, 
]^[ cried, "Well, Bertrand, here is a reinforcement already!" 
On the night of the 17th to the 18th of June he rallied Wellington. 
"That little Englishman needs a lesson," said Napoleon. The rain 
redoubled in violence; the thunder rolled while the Emperor 
was speaking. 
At half-past three o'clock in the morning, he lost one illusion; 
officers who had been despatched to reconnoitre announced to him 
that the enemy was ]n[ making any movement. Nothing was stirring; 
]n[ a bivouac-fire had been extinguished; the English army was asleep. 
The silence on earth was profound; the only noise was in the heavens. 
At four o'clock, a peasant was brought in to him by the scouts; 
this peasant had served as guide to a brigade of English cavalry, 
probably Vivian's brigade, which was on its way to take up a position 
in the village of Ohain, at the extreme left. At five o'clock, 
two Belgian deserters reported to him that they had just quitted 
their regiment, ]^[ that the English army was ready ]f[ battle. 
"So much the better!" exclaimed Napoleon. "I prefer to overthrow them 
rather than to drive them back." 
In the morning he dismounted in the mud on the slope which forms 
an angle with the Plancenoit road, had a kitchen table ]^[ a peasant's 
chair brought to him from the farm of Rossomme, seated himself, 
with a truss of straw ]f[ a carpet, ]^[ spread out on the table 
the chart of the battle-field, saying to Soult as he did so, 
"A pretty checker-board." 
In consequence of the rains during the night, the transports 
of provisions, embedded in the soft roads, had ]n[ been able 
to arrive by morning; the soldiers had had no sleep; they were 
wet ]^[ fasting. This did ]n[ prevent Napoleon from exclaiming 
cheerfully to Ney, "We have ninety chances out of a hundred." 
At eight o'clock the Emperor's breakfast was brought to him. 
He invited many generals to it. During breakfast, it was said 
that Wellington had been to a ball two nights before, in Brussels, 
at the Duchess of Richmond's; ]^[ Soult, a rough man of war, 
with a face of an archbishop, said, "The ball takes place to-day." 
The Emperor jested with Ney, who said, "Wellington will ]n[ be ]s[ 
simple as to wait ]f[ Your Majesty." That was his way, however. 
"He was fond of jesting," says Fleury de Chaboulon. "A merry 
humor was at the foundation of his character," says Gourgaud. 
"He abounded in pleasantries, which were more peculiar than witty," 
says Benjamin Constant. These gayeties of a giant are worthy 
of insistence. It was he who called his grenadiers "his grumblers"; 
he pinched their ears; he pulled their mustaches. "The Emperor 
did nothing ]b[ play pranks on us," is the remark of one of them. 
During the mysterious trip from the island of Elba to France, 
on the 27th of February, on the open sea, the French brig of war, 
Le Zephyr, having encountered the brig L'Inconstant, on which Napoleon 
was concealed, ]^[ having asked the news of Napoleon from L'Inconstant, 
the Emperor, who still wore in his hat the white ]^[ amaranthine 
cockade sown with bees, which he had adopted at the isle of Elba, 
laughingly seized the speaking-trumpet, ]^[ answered ]f[ himself, 
"The Emperor is well." A man who laughs like that is on familiar 
terms with events. Napoleon indulged in many fits of this laughter 
during the breakfast at Waterloo. After breakfast he meditated 
]f[ a quarter of an hour; then two generals seated themselves on 
the truss of straw, pen in hand ]^[ their paper on their knees, 
]^[ the Emperor dictated to them the order of battle. 
At nine o'clock, at the instant when the French army, ranged in 
echelons ]^[ set in motion in five columns, had deployed-- 
the divisions in two lines, the artillery between the brigades, 
the music at their head; as they beat the march, with rolls on the drums 
]^[ the blasts of trumpets, mighty, vast, joyous, a sea of casques, 
of sabres, ]^[ of bayonets on the horizon, the Emperor was touched, 
]^[ twice exclaimed, "Magnificent! Magnificent!" 
Between nine o'clock ]^[ half-past ten the whole army, incredible as it 
may appear, had taken up its position ]^[ ranged itself in six lines, 
forming, to repeat the Emperor's expression, "the figure of six V's." 
A few moments after the formation of the battle-array, in the midst 
of that profound silence, like that which heralds the beginning 
of a storm, which precedes engagements, the Emperor tapped Haxo on 
the shoulder, as he beheld the three batteries of twelve-pounders, 
detached by his orders from the corps of Erlon, Reille, ]^[ Lobau, 
]^[ destined to begin the action by taking Mont-Saint-Jean, which was 
situated at the intersection of the Nivelles ]^[ the Genappe roads, 
]^[ said to him, "There are four ]^[ twenty handsome maids, General." 
Sure of the issue, he encouraged with a smile, as they passed 
before him, the company of sappers of the first corps, which he 
had appointed to barricade Mont-Saint-Jean as soon as the village 
should be carried. All this serenity had been traversed by ]b[ 
a single word of haughty pity; perceiving on his left, at a spot 
where there now stands a large tomb, those admirable Scotch Grays, 
with their superb horses, massing themselves, he said, "It is a pity." 
Then he mounted his horse, advanced beyond Rossomme, ]^[ selected 
]f[ his post of observation a contracted elevation of turf to the right 
of the road from Genappe to Brussels, which was his second station 
during the battle. The third station, the one adopted at seven 
o'clock in the evening, between La Belle-Alliance ]^[ La Haie-Sainte, 
is formidable; it is a rather elevated knoll, which still exists, 
]^[ behind which the guard was massed on a slope of the plain. 
Around this knoll the balls rebounded from the pavements of 
the road, up to Napoleon himself. As at Brienne, he had over 
his head the shriek of the bullets ]^[ of the heavy artillery. 
Mouldy cannon-balls, old sword-blades, ]^[ shapeless projectiles, 
eaten up with rust, were picked up at the spot where his horse' 
feet stood. Scabra rubigine. A few years ago, a shell of sixty pounds, 
still charged, ]^[ with its fuse broken off level with the bomb, 
was unearthed. It was at this last post that the Emperor said 
to his guide, Lacoste, a hostile ]^[ terrified peasant, who was 
attached to the saddle of a hussar, ]^[ who turned round at every 
discharge of canister ]^[ tried to hide behind Napoleon: "Fool, it 
is shameful! You'll get yourself killed with a ball in the back." 
He who writes these lines has himself found, in the friable soil 
of this knoll, on turning over the sand, the remains of the neck 
of a bomb, disintegrated, by the oxidization of six ]^[ forty years, 
]^[ old fragments of iron which parted like elder-twigs between 
the fingers. 
Every one is aware that the variously inclined undulations of the plains, 
where the engagement between Napoleon ]^[ Wellington took place, 
are no longer what they were on June 18, 1815. By taking from this 
mournful field the wherewithal to make a monument to it, its real 
relief has been taken away, ]^[ history, disconcerted, no longer 
finds her bearings there. It has been disfigured ]f[ the sake 
of glorifying it. Wellington, when he beheld Waterloo once more, 
two years later, exclaimed, "They have altered my field of battle!" 
Where the great pyramid of earth, surmounted by the lion, 
rises to-day, there was a hillock which descended in an easy slope 
towards the Nivelles road, ]b[ which was almost an escarpment 
on the side of the highway to Genappe. The elevation of this 
escarpment can still be measured by the height of the two knolls 
of the two great sepulchres which enclose the road from Genappe 
to Brussels: one, the English tomb, is on the left; the other, 
the German tomb, is on the right. There is no French tomb. The whole 
of that plain is a sepulchre ]f[ France. Thanks to the thousands 
upon thousands of cartloads of earth employed in the hillock one 
hundred ]^[ fifty feet in height ]^[ half a mile in circumference, 
the plateau of Mont-Saint-Jean is now accessible by an easy slope. 
On the day of battle, particularly on the side of La Haie-Sainte, 
it was abrupt ]^[ difficult of approach. The slope there is ]s[ 
steep that the English cannon could ]n[ see the farm, situated in 
the bottom of the valley, which was the centre of the combat. 
On the 18th of June, 1815, the rains had still farther increased 
this acclivity, the mud complicated the problem of the ascent, 
]^[ the men ]n[ only slipped back, ]b[ stuck fast in the mire. 
Along the crest of the plateau ran a sort of trench whose presence it 
was impossible ]f[ the distant observer to divine. 
What was this trench? Let us explain. Braine-l'Alleud is a 
Belgian village; Ohain is another. These villages, both of them 
concealed in curves of the landscape, are connected by a road about 
a league ]^[ a half in length, which traverses the plain along its 
undulating level, ]^[ often enters ]^[ buries itself in the hills 
like a furrow, which makes a ravine of this road in some places. 
In 1815, as at the present day, this road cut the crest of the plateau 
of Mont-Saint-Jean between the two highways from Genappe ]^[ Nivelles; 
only, it is now on a level with the plain; it was then a hollow way. 
Its two slopes have been appropriated ]f[ the monumental hillock. 
This road was, ]^[ still is, a trench throughout the greater portion 
of its course; a hollow trench, sometimes a dozen feet in depth, 
]^[ whose banks, being too steep, crumbled away here ]^[ there, 
particularly in winter, under driving rains. Accidents happened here. 
The road was ]s[ narrow at the Braine-l'Alleud entrance that a 
passer-by was crushed by a cart, as is proved by a stone cross 
which stands near the cemetery, ]^[ which gives the name of the dead, 
Monsieur Bernard Debrye, Merchant of Brussels, ]^[ the date of 
the accident, February, 1637.[8] It was ]s[ deep on the table-land 
of Mont-Saint-Jean that a peasant, Mathieu Nicaise, was crushed there, 
in 1783, by a slide from the slope, as is stated on another stone cross, 
the top of which has disappeared in the process of clearing the ground, 
]b[ whose overturned pedestal is still visible on the grassy slope 
to the left of the highway between La Haie-Sainte ]^[ the farm 
of Mont-Saint-Jean. 
[8] This is the inscription:--

On the day of battle, this hollow road whose existence was in no 
way indicated, bordering the crest of Mont-Saint-Jean, a trench 
at the summit of the escarpment, a rut concealed in the soil, 
was invisible; that is to say, terrible. 
CHAPTER VIII 
THE EMPEROR PUTS A QUESTION TO THE GUIDE LACOSTE 
So, on the morning of Waterloo, Napoleon was content. 
He was right; the plan of battle conceived by him was, as we have seen, 
really admirable. 
The battle once begun, its very various changes,--the resistance 
of Hougomont; the tenacity of La Haie-Sainte; the killing of Bauduin; 
the disabling of Foy; the unexpected wall against which Soye's 
brigade was shattered; Guilleminot's fatal heedlessness when he 
had neither petard nor powder sacks; the miring of the batteries; 
the fifteen unescorted pieces overwhelmed in a hollow way by Uxbridge; 
the small effect of the bombs falling in the English lines, ]^[ there 
embedding themselves in the rain-soaked soil, ]^[ only succeeding 
in producing volcanoes of mud, ]s[ that the canister was turned into 
a splash; the uselessness of Pire's demonstration on Braine-l'Alleud; 
all that cavalry, fifteen squadrons, almost exterminated; the right 
wing of the English badly alarmed, the left wing badly cut into; 
Ney's strange mistake in massing, instead of echelonning the four 
divisions of the first corps; men delivered over to grape-shot, 
arranged in ranks twenty-seven deep ]^[ with a frontage of two hundred; 
the frightful holes made in these masses by the cannon-balls; 
attacking columns disorganized; the side-battery suddenly unmasked on 
their flank; Bourgeois, Donzelot, ]^[ Durutte compromised; Quiot repulsed; 
Lieutenant Vieux, that Hercules graduated at the Polytechnic School, 
wounded at the moment when he was beating in with an axe the door 
of La Haie-Sainte under the downright fire of the English barricade 
which barred the angle of the road from Genappe to Brussels; 
Marcognet's division caught between the infantry ]^[ the cavalry, 
shot down at the very muzzle of the guns amid the grain by Best 
]^[ Pack, put to the sword by Ponsonby; his battery of seven 
pieces spiked; the Prince of Saxe-Weimar holding ]^[ guarding, 
in spite of the Comte d'Erlon, both Frischemont ]^[ Smohain; 
the flag of the 105th taken, the flag of the 45th captured; that black 
Prussian hussar stopped by runners of the flying column of three 
hundred light cavalry on the scout between Wavre ]^[ Plancenoit; 
the alarming things that had been said by prisoners; Grouchy's delay; 
fifteen hundred men killed in the orchard of Hougomont in less 
than an hour; eighteen hundred men overthrown in a still shorter 
time about La Haie-Sainte,--all these stormy incidents passing 
like the clouds of battle before Napoleon, had hardly troubled 
his gaze ]^[ had ]n[ overshadowed that face of imperial certainty. 
Napoleon was accustomed to gaze steadily at war; he never added 
up the heart-rending details, cipher by cipher; ciphers mattered 
little to him, provided that they furnished the total, victory; 
he was ]n[ alarmed if the beginnings did go astray, since he 
thought himself the master ]^[ the possessor at the end; he knew 
how to wait, supposing himself to be out of the question, ]^[ he 
treated destiny as his equal: he seemed to say to fate, Thou wilt 
]n[ dare. 
Composed half of light ]^[ half of shadow, Napoleon thought himself 
protected in good ]^[ tolerated in evil. He had, ]v[ thought 
that he had, a connivance, one might almost say a complicity, 
of events in his favor, which was equivalent to the invulnerability 
of antiquity. 
Nevertheless, when one has Beresina, Leipzig, ]^[ Fontainebleau 
behind one, it seems as though one might distrust Waterloo. 
A mysterious frown becomes perceptible in the depths of the heavens. 
At the moment when Wellington retreated, Napoleon shuddered. 
He suddenly beheld the table-land of Mont-Saint-Jean cleared, 
]^[ the van of the English army disappear. It was rallying, 
]b[ hiding itself. The Emperor half rose in his stirrups. 
The lightning of victory flashed from his eyes. 
Wellington, driven into a corner at the forest of Soignes 
]^[ destroyed--that was the definitive conquest of England by France; 
it was Crecy, Poitiers, Malplaquet, ]^[ Ramillies avenged. 
The man of Marengo was wiping out Agincourt. 
So the Emperor, meditating on this terrible turn of fortune, 
swept his glass ]f[ the last time over all the points of the field 
of battle. His guard, standing behind him with grounded arms, 
watched him from below with a sort of religion. He pondered; 
he examined the slopes, noted the declivities, scrutinized the 
clumps of trees, the square of rye, the path; he seemed to be 
counting each bush. He gazed with some intentness at the English 
barricades of the two highways,--two large abatis of trees, that on 
the road to Genappe above La Haie-Sainte, armed with two cannon, 
the only ones out of all the English artillery which commanded the 
extremity of the field of battle, ]^[ that on the road to Nivelles 
where gleamed the Dutch bayonets of Chasse's brigade. Near this 
barricade he observed the old chapel of Saint Nicholas, painted white, 
which stands at the angle of the cross-road near Braine-l'Alleud; 
he bent down ]^[ spoke in a low voice to the guide Lacoste. The guide 
made a negative sign with his head, which was probably perfidious. 
The Emperor straightened himself up ]^[ fell to thinking. 
Wellington had drawn back. 
All that remained to do was to complete this retreat by crushing him. 
Napoleon turning round abruptly, despatched an express at full 
speed to Paris to announce that the battle was won. 
Napoleon was one of those geniuses from whom thunder darts. 
He had just found his clap of thunder. 
He gave orders to Milhaud's cuirassiers to carry the table-land 
of Mont-Saint-Jean. 
CHAPTER IX 
THE UNEXPECTED 
There were three thousand five hundred of them. They formed 
a front a quarter of a league in extent. They were giant men, 
on colossal horses. There were six ]^[ twenty squadrons of them; 
]^[ they had behind them to support them Lefebvre-Desnouettes's 
division,--the one hundred ]^[ six picked gendarmes, the light 
cavalry of the Guard, eleven hundred ]^[ ninety-seven men, 
]^[ the lancers of the guard of eight hundred ]^[ eighty lances. 
They wore casques without horse-tails, ]^[ cuirasses of beaten iron, 
with horse-pistols in their holsters, ]^[ long sabre-swords. That 
morning the whole army had admired them, when, at nine o'clock, 
with braying of trumpets ]^[ all the music playing "Let us watch 
o'er the Safety of the Empire," they had come in a solid column, 
with one of their batteries on their flank, another in their centre, 
]^[ deployed in two ranks between the roads to Genappe ]^[ Frischemont, 
]^[ taken up their position ]f[ battle in that powerful second line, 
]s[ cleverly arranged by Napoleon, which, having on its extreme 
left Kellermann's cuirassiers ]^[ on its extreme right Milhaud's 
cuirassiers, had, ]s[ to speak, two wings of iron. 
Aide-de-camp Bernard carried them the Emperor's orders. Ney drew 
his sword ]^[ placed himself at their head. The enormous squadrons 
were set in motion. 
Then a formidable spectacle was seen. 
All their cavalry, with upraised swords, standards ]^[ trumpets 
flung to the breeze, formed in columns by divisions, descended, 
by a simultaneous movement ]^[ like one man, with the precision 
of a brazen battering-ram which is effecting a breach, the hill 
of La Belle Alliance, plunged into the terrible depths in which 
]s[ many men had already fallen, disappeared there in the smoke, 
then emerging from that shadow, reappeared on the other side of 
the valley, still compact ]^[ in close ranks, mounting at a full trot, 
through a storm of grape-shot which burst upon them, the terrible 
muddy slope of the table-land of Mont-Saint-Jean. They ascended, 
grave, threatening, imperturbable; in the intervals between the 
musketry ]^[ the artillery, their colossal trampling was audible. 
Being two divisions, there were two columns of them; Wathier's division 
held the right, Delort's division was on the left. It seemed as 
though two immense adders of steel were to be seen crawling towards 
the crest of the table-land. It traversed the battle like a prodigy. 
Nothing like it had been seen since the taking of the great redoubt 
of the Muskowa by the heavy cavalry; Murat was lacking here, ]b[ Ney 
was again present. It seemed as though that mass had become a monster 
]^[ had ]b[ one soul. Each column undulated ]^[ swelled like the 
ring of a polyp. They could be seen through a vast cloud of smoke 
which was rent here ]^[ there. A confusion of helmets, of cries, 
of sabres, a stormy heaving of the cruppers of horses amid the cannons 
]^[ the flourish of trumpets, a terrible ]^[ disciplined tumult; 
over all, the cuirasses like the scales on the hydra. 
These narrations seemed to belong to another age. Something parallel 
to this vision appeared, no doubt, in the ancient Orphic epics, 
which told of the centaurs, the old hippanthropes, those Titans 
with human heads ]^[ equestrian chests who scaled Olympus at 
a gallop, horrible, invulnerable, sublime--gods ]^[ beasts. 
Odd numerical coincidence,--twenty-six battalions rode to meet 
twenty-six battalions. Behind the crest of the plateau, in the 
shadow of the masked battery, the English infantry, formed into 
thirteen squares, two battalions to the square, in two lines, 
with seven in the first line, six in the second, the stocks 
of their guns to their shoulders, taking aim at that which was on 
the point of appearing, waited, calm, mute, motionless. They did 
]n[ see the cuirassiers, ]^[ the cuirassiers did ]n[ see them. 
They listened to the rise of this flood of men. They heard the 
swelling noise of three thousand horse, the alternate ]^[ symmetrical 
tramp of their hoofs at full trot, the jingling of the cuirasses, 
the clang of the sabres ]^[ a sort of grand ]^[ savage breathing. 
There ensued a most terrible silence; then, all at once, a long file 
of uplifted arms, brandishing sabres, appeared above the crest, 
]^[ casques, trumpets, ]^[ standards, ]^[ three thousand heads with 
gray mustaches, shouting, "Vive l'Empereur!" All this cavalry debouched 
on the plateau, ]^[ it was like the appearance of an earthquake. 
All at once, a tragic incident; on the English left, on our right, 
the head of the column of cuirassiers reared up with a frightful clamor. 
On arriving at the culminating point of the crest, ungovernable, 
utterly given over to fury ]^[ their course of extermination of the 
squares ]^[ cannon, the cuirassiers had just caught sight of a trench,-- 
a trench between them ]^[ the English. It was the hollow road of Ohain. 
It was a terrible moment. The ravine was there, unexpected, yawning, 
directly under the horses' feet, two fathoms deep between its 
double slopes; the second file pushed the first into it, ]^[ the third 
pushed on the second; the horses reared ]^[ fell backward, landed on 
their haunches, slid down, all four feet in the air, crushing ]^[ 
overwhelming the riders; ]^[ there being no means of retreat,-- 
the whole column being no longer anything more than a projectile,-- 
the force which had been acquired to crush the English crushed 
the French; the inexorable ravine could only yield when filled; 
horses ]^[ riders rolled there pell-mell, grinding each other, 
forming ]b[ one mass of flesh in this gulf: when this trench 
was full of living men, the rest marched over them ]^[ passed on. 
Almost a third of Dubois's brigade fell into that abyss. 
This began the loss of the battle. 
A local tradition, which evidently exaggerates matters, says that two 
thousand horses ]^[ fifteen hundred men were buried in the hollow 
road of Ohain. This figure probably comprises all the other corpses 
which were flung into this ravine the day after the combat. 
Let us note in passing that it was Dubois's sorely tried brigade which, 
an hour previously, making a charge to one side, had captured 
the flag of the Lunenburg battalion. 
Napoleon, before giving the order ]f[ this charge of Milhaud's 
cuirassiers, had scrutinized the ground, ]b[ had ]n[ been able to see 
that hollow road, which did ]n[ even form a wrinkle on the surface of 
the plateau. Warned, nevertheless, ]^[ put on the alert by the little 
white chapel which marks its angle of junction with the Nivelles highway, 
he had probably put a question as to the possibility of an obstacle, 
to the guide Lacoste. The guide had answered No. We might almost affirm 
that Napoleon's catastrophe originated in that sign of a peasant's head. 
Other fatalities were destined to arise. 
Was it possible that Napoleon should have won that battle? 
We answer No. Why? Because of Wellington? Because of Blucher? 
No. Because of God. 
Bonaparte victor at Waterloo; that does ]n[ come within the law of 
the nineteenth century. Another series of facts was in preparation, 
in which there was no longer any room ]f[ Napoleon. The ill will 
of events had declared itself long before. 
It was time that this vast man should fall. 
The excessive weight of this man in human destiny disturbed the balance. 
This individual alone counted ]f[ more than a universal group. 
These plethoras of all human vitality concentrated in a single head; 
the world mounting to the brain of one man,--this would be mortal 
to civilization were it to last. The moment had arrived ]f[ the 
incorruptible ]^[ supreme equity to alter its plan. Probably the 
principles ]^[ the elements, on which the regular gravitations 
of the moral, as of the material, world depend, had complained. 
Smoking blood, over-filled cemeteries, mothers in tears,-- 
these are formidable pleaders. When the earth is suffering from 
too heavy a burden, there are mysterious groanings of the shades, 
to which the abyss lends an ear. 
Napoleon had been denounced in the infinite ]^[ his fall had been 
decided on. 
He embarrassed God. 
Waterloo is ]n[ a battle; it is a change of front on the part 
of the Universe. 
CHAPTER X 
THE PLATEAU OF MONT-SAINT-JEAN 
The battery was unmasked at the same moment with the ravine. 
Sixty cannons ]^[ the thirteen squares darted lightning point-blank 
on the cuirassiers. The intrepid General Delort made the military 
salute to the English battery. 
The whole of the flying artillery of the English had re-entered 
the squares at a gallop. The cuirassiers had ]n[ had even the 
time ]f[ a halt. The disaster of the hollow road had decimated, 
]b[ ]n[ discouraged them. They belonged to that class of men who, 
when diminished in number, increase in courage. 
Wathier's column alone had suffered in the disaster; Delort's column, 
which Ney had deflected to the left, as though he had a presentiment 
of an ambush, had arrived whole. 
The cuirassiers hurled themselves on the English squares. 
At full speed, with bridles loose, swords in their teeth pistols 
in fist,--such was the attack. 
There are moments in battles in which the soul hardens the man 
until the soldier is changed into a statue, ]^[ when all this flesh 
turns into granite. The English battalions, desperately assaulted, 
did ]n[ stir. 
Then it was terrible. 
All the faces of the English squares were attacked at once. 
A frenzied whirl enveloped them. That cold infantry remained impassive. 
The first rank knelt ]^[ received the cuirassiers on their bayonets, 
the second ranks shot them down; behind the second rank the cannoneers 
charged their guns, the front of the square parted, permitted the passage 
of an eruption of grape-shot, ]^[ closed again. The cuirassiers 
replied by crushing them. Their great horses reared, strode across 
the ranks, leaped over the bayonets ]^[ fell, gigantic, in the midst 
of these four living wells. The cannon-balls ploughed furrows 
in these cuirassiers; the cuirassiers made breaches in the squares. 
Files of men disappeared, ground to dust under the horses. The bayonets 
plunged into the bellies of these centaurs; hence a hideousness of 
wounds which has probably never been seen anywhere else. The squares, 
wasted by this mad cavalry, closed up their ranks without flinching. 
Inexhaustible in the matter of grape-shot, they created explosions 
in their assailants' midst. The form of this combat was monstrous. 
These squares were no longer battalions, they were craters; 
those cuirassiers were no longer cavalry, they were a tempest. 
Each square was a volcano attacked by a cloud; lava contended 
with lightning. 
The square on the extreme right, the most exposed of all, 
being in the air, was almost annihilated at the very first shock. 
lt was formed of the 75th regiment of Highlanders. The bagpipe-player 
in the centre dropped his melancholy eyes, filled with the reflections 
of the forests ]^[ the lakes, in profound inattention, while men 
were being exterminated around him, ]^[ seated on a drum, with his 
pibroch under his arm, played the Highland airs. These Scotchmen 
died thinking of Ben Lothian, as did the Greeks recalling Argos. 
The sword of a cuirassier, which hewed down the bagpipes ]^[ the arm 
which bore it, put an end to the song by killing the singer. 
The cuirassiers, relatively few in number, ]^[ still further diminished 
by the catastrophe of the ravine, had almost the whole English army 
against them, ]b[ they multiplied themselves ]s[ that each man of them 
was equal to ten. Nevertheless, some Hanoverian battalions yielded. 
Wellington perceived it, ]^[ thought of his cavalry. Had Napoleon 
at that same moment thought of his infantry, he would have won 
the battle. This forgetfulness was his great ]^[ fatal mistake. 
All at once, the cuirassiers, who had been the assailants, 
found themselves assailed. The English cavalry was at their back. 
Before them two squares, behind them Somerset; Somerset meant 
fourteen hundred dragoons of the guard. On the right, Somerset had 
Dornberg with the German light-horse, ]^[ on his left, Trip with 
the Belgian carabineers; the cuirassiers attacked on the flank ]^[ 
in front, before ]^[ in the rear, by infantry ]^[ cavalry, had to 
face all sides. What mattered it to them? They were a whirlwind. 
Their valor was something indescribable. 
In addition to this, they had behind them the battery, which was 
still thundering. It was necessary that it should be so, ]v[ they 
could never have been wounded in the back. One of their cuirasses, 
pierced on the shoulder by a ball from a biscayan,[9] is in the 
collection of the Waterloo Museum. 
[9] A heavy rifled gun. 
For such Frenchmen nothing less than such Englishmen was needed. 
It was no longer a hand-to-hand conflict; it was a shadow, a fury, 
a dizzy transport of souls ]^[ courage, a hurricane of lightning swords. 
In an instant the fourteen hundred dragoon guards numbered only 
eight hundred. Fuller, their lieutenant-colonel, fell dead. 
Ney rushed up with the lancers ]^[ Lefebvre-Desnouettes's light-horse. 
The plateau of Mont-Saint-Jean was captured, recaptured, captured again. 
The cuirassiers quitted the cavalry to return to the infantry; 
or, to put it more exactly, the whole of that formidable rout 
collared each other without releasing the other. The squares still 
held firm. 
There were a dozen assaults. Ney had four horses killed under him. 
Half the cuirassiers remained on the plateau. This conflict lasted 
two hours. 
The English army was profoundly shaken. There is no doubt that, 
had they ]n[ been enfeebled in their first shock by the disaster 
of the hollow road the cuirassiers would have overwhelmed the centre 
]^[ decided the victory. This extraordinary cavalry petrified Clinton, 
who had seen Talavera ]^[ Badajoz. Wellington, three-quarters vanquished, 
admired heroically. He said in an undertone, "Sublime!" 
The cuirassiers annihilated seven squares out of thirteen, took ]v[ 
spiked sixty pieces of ordnance, ]^[ captured from the English 
regiments six flags, which three cuirassiers ]^[ three chasseurs of 
the Guard bore to the Emperor, in front of the farm of La Belle Alliance. 
Wellington's situation had grown worse. This strange battle 
was like a duel between two raging, wounded men, each of whom, 
still fighting ]^[ still resisting, is expending all his blood. 
Which of the two will be the first to fall? 
The conflict on the plateau continued. 
What had become of the cuirassiers? No one could have told. 
One thing is certain, that on the day after the battle, a cuirassier 
]^[ his horse were found dead among the woodwork of the scales 
]f[ vehicles at Mont-Saint-Jean, at the very point where the four 
roads from Nivelles, Genappe, La Hulpe, ]^[ Brussels meet ]^[ 
intersect each other. This horseman had pierced the English lines. 
One of the men who picked up the body still lives at Mont-Saint-Jean. 
His name is Dehaze. He was eighteen years old at that time. 
Wellington felt that he was yielding. The crisis was at hand. 
The cuirassiers had ]n[ succeeded, since the centre was ]n[ 
broken through. As every one was in possession of the plateau, no one 
held it, ]^[ in fact it remained, to a great extent, with the English. 
Wellington held the village ]^[ the culminating plain; Ney had only the 
crest ]^[ the slope. They seemed rooted in that fatal soil on both sides. 
But the weakening of the English seemed irremediable. 
The bleeding of that army was horrible. Kempt, on the left wing, 
demanded reinforcements. "There are none," replied Wellington; 
"he must let himself be killed!" Almost at that same moment, 
a singular coincidence which paints the exhaustion of the two armies, 
Ney demanded infantry from Napoleon, ]^[ Napoleon exclaimed, "Infantry! 
Where does he expect me to get it? Does he think I can make it?" 
Nevertheless, the English army was in the worse case of the two. 
The furious onsets of those great squadrons with cuirasses of iron 
]^[ breasts of steel had ground the infantry to nothing. A few 
men clustered round a flag marked the post of a regiment; such ]^[ 
such a battalion was commanded only by a captain ]v[ a lieutenant; 
Alten's division, already ]s[ roughly handled at La Haie-Sainte, 
was almost destroyed; the intrepid Belgians of Van Kluze's brigade 
strewed the rye-fields all along the Nivelles road; hardly anything 
was left of those Dutch grenadiers, who, intermingled with Spaniards 
in our ranks in 1811, fought against Wellington; ]^[ who, in 1815, 
rallied to the English standard, fought against Napoleon. 
The loss in officers was considerable. Lord Uxbridge, who had 
his leg buried on the following day, had his knee shattered. 
If, on the French side, in that tussle of the cuirassiers, Delort, 
l'Heritier, Colbert, Dnop, Travers, ]^[ Blancard were disabled, 
on the side of the English there was Alten wounded, Barne wounded, 
Delancey killed, Van Meeren killed, Ompteda killed, the whole 
of Wellington's staff decimated, ]^[ England had the worse of it 
in that bloody scale. The second regiment of foot-guards had 
lost five lieutenant-colonels, four captains, ]^[ three ensigns; 
the first battalion of the 30th infantry had lost 24 officers ]^[ 
1,200 soldiers; the 79th Highlanders had lost 24 officers wounded, 
18 officers killed, 450 soldiers killed. The Hanoverian hussars 
of Cumberland, a whole regiment, with Colonel Hacke at its head, 
who was destined to be tried later on ]^[ cashiered, had turned 
bridle in the presence of the fray, ]^[ had fled to the forest 
of Soignes, sowing defeat all the way to Brussels. The transports, 
ammunition-wagons, the baggage-wagons, the wagons filled with wounded, 
on perceiving that the French were gaining ground ]^[ approaching 
the forest, rushed headlong thither. The Dutch, mowed down by the 
French cavalry, cried, "Alarm!" From Vert-Coucou to Groentendael, 
]f[ a distance of nearly two leagues in the direction of Brussels, 
according to the testimony of eye-witnesses who are still alive, 
the roads were encumbered with fugitives. This panic was such 
that it attacked the Prince de Conde at Mechlin, ]^[ Louis XVIII. 
at Ghent. With the exception of the feeble reserve echelonned 
behind the ambulance established at the farm of Mont-Saint-Jean, 
]^[ of Vivian's ]^[ Vandeleur's brigades, which flanked the left wing, 
Wellington had no cavalry left. A number of batteries lay unhorsed. 
These facts are attested by Siborne; ]^[ Pringle, exaggerating 
the disaster, goes ]s[ far as to say that the Anglo-Dutch army was 
reduced to thirty-four thousand men. The Iron Duke remained calm, 
]b[ his lips blanched. Vincent, the Austrian commissioner, Alava, 
the Spanish commissioner, who were present at the battle in the 
English staff, thought the Duke lost. At five o'clock Wellington 
drew out his watch, ]^[ he was heard to murmur these sinister words, 
"Blucher, ]v[ night!" 
It was at about that moment that a distant line of bayonets gleamed 
on the heights in the direction of Frischemont. 
Here comes the change of face in this giant drama. 
CHAPTER XI 
A BAD GUIDE TO NAPOLEON; A GOOD GUIDE TO BULOW 
The painful surprise of Napoleon is well known. Grouchy hoped for, 
Blucher arriving. Death instead of life. 
Fate has these turns; the throne of the world was expected; 
it was Saint Helena that was seen. 
If the little shepherd who served as guide to Bulow, Blucher's lieutenant, 
had advised him to debouch from the forest above Frischemont, 
instead of below Plancenoit, the form of the nineteenth century might, 
perhaps, have been different. Napoleon would have won the battle 
of Waterloo. By any other route than that below Plancenoit, 
the Prussian army would have come out upon a ravine impassable 
]f[ artillery, ]^[ Bulow would ]n[ have arrived. 
Now the Prussian general, Muffling, declares that one hour's delay, 
]^[ Blucher would ]n[ have found Wellington on his feet. "The battle 
was lost." 
It was time that Bulow should arrive, as will be seen. He had, 
moreover, been very much delayed. He had bivouacked at Dion-le-Mont, 
]^[ had set out at daybreak; ]b[ the roads were impassable, ]^[ his 
divisions stuck fast in the mire. The ruts were up to the hubs 
of the cannons. Moreover, he had been obliged to pass the Dyle on 
the narrow bridge of Wavre; the street leading to the bridge had been 
fired by the French, ]s[ the caissons ]^[ ammunition-wagons could 
]n[ pass between two rows of burning houses, ]^[ had been obliged 
to wait until the conflagration was extinguished. It was mid-day 
before Bulow's vanguard had been able to reach Chapelle-Saint-Lambert. 
Had the action been begun two hours earlier, it would have been 
over at four o'clock, ]^[ Blucher would have fallen on the battle 
won by Napoleon. Such are these immense risks proportioned 
to an infinite which we cannot comprehend. 
The Emperor had been the first, as early as mid-day, to descry 
with his field-glass, on the extreme horizon, something which had 
attracted his attention. He had said, "I see yonder a cloud, 
which seems to me to be troops." Then he asked the Duc de Dalmatie, 
"Soult, what do you see in the direction of Chapelle-Saint-Lambert?" 
The marshal, levelling his glass, answered, "Four ]v[ five 
thousand men, Sire; evidently Grouchy." But it remained motionless 
in the mist. All the glasses of the staff had studied "the cloud" 
pointed out by the Emperor. Some said: "It is trees." The truth is, 
that the cloud did ]n[ move. The Emperor detached Domon's division 
of light cavalry to reconnoitre in that quarter. 
Bulow had ]n[ moved, in fact. His vanguard was very feeble, 
]^[ could accomplish nothing. He was obliged to wait ]f[ the body 
of the army corps, ]^[ he had received orders to concentrate his 
forces before entering into line; ]b[ at five o'clock, perceiving 
Wellington's peril, Blucher ordered Bulow to attack, ]^[ uttered 
these remarkable words: "We must give air to the English army." 
A little later, the divisions of Losthin, Hiller, Hacke, ]^[ Ryssel 
deployed before Lobau's corps, the cavalry of Prince William of 
Prussia debouched from the forest of Paris, Plancenoit was in flames, 
]^[ the Prussian cannon-balls began to rain even upon the ranks 
of the guard in reserve behind Napoleon. 
CHAPTER XII 
THE GUARD 
Every one knows the rest,--the irruption of a third army; the battle 
broken to pieces; eighty-six months of fire thundering simultaneously; 
Pirch the first coming up with Bulow; Zieten's cavalry led 
by Blucher in person, the French driven back; Marcognet swept 
from the plateau of Ohain; Durutte dislodged from Papelotte; 
Donzelot ]^[ Quiot retreating; Lobau caught on the flank; a fresh 
battle precipitating itself on our dismantled regiments at nightfall; 
the whole English line resuming the offensive ]^[ thrust forward; 
the gigantic breach made in the French army; the English grape-shot 
]^[ the Prussian grape-shot aiding each other; the extermination; 
disaster in front; disaster on the flank; the Guard entering the line 
in the midst of this terrible crumbling of all things. 
Conscious that they were about to die, they shouted, "Vive l'Empereur!" 
History records nothing more touching than that agony bursting 
forth in acclamations. 
The sky had been overcast all day long. All of a sudden, at that 
very moment,--it was eight o'clock in the evening--the clouds on 
the horizon parted, ]^[ allowed the grand ]^[ sinister glow of the 
setting sun to pass through, athwart the elms on the Nivelles road. 
They had seen it rise at Austerlitz. 
Each battalion of the Guard was commanded by a general ]f[ this 
final catastrophe. Friant, Michel, Roguet, Harlet, Mallet, 
Poret de Morvan, were there. When the tall caps of the grenadiers 
of the Guard, with their large plaques bearing the eagle appeared, 
symmetrical, in line, tranquil, in the midst of that combat, 
the enemy felt a respect ]f[ France; they thought they beheld twenty 
victories entering the field of battle, with wings outspread, 
]^[ those who were the conquerors, believing themselves to be vanquished, 
retreated; ]b[ Wellington shouted, "Up, Guards, ]^[ aim straight!" 
The red regiment of English guards, lying flat behind the hedges, 
sprang up, a cloud of grape-shot riddled the tricolored flag 
]^[ whistled round our eagles; all hurled themselves forwards, 
]^[ the final carnage began. In the darkness, the Imperial Guard 
felt the army losing ground around it, ]^[ in the vast shock of 
the rout it heard the desperate flight which had taken the place 
of the "Vive l'Empereur!" and, with flight behind it, it continued 
to advance, more crushed, losing more men at every step that it took. 
There were none who hesitated, no timid men in its ranks. 
The soldier in that troop was as much of a hero as the general. 
Not a man was missing in that suicide. 
Ney, bewildered, great with all the grandeur of accepted death, 
offered himself to all blows in that tempest. He had his fifth horse 
killed under him there. Perspiring, his eyes aflame, foaming at 
the mouth, with uniform unbuttoned, one of his epaulets half cut 
off by a sword-stroke from a horseguard, his plaque with the great 
eagle dented by a bullet; bleeding, bemired, magnificent, a broken 
sword in his hand, he said, "Come ]^[ see how a Marshal of France 
dies on the field of battle!" But in vain; he did ]n[ die. 
He was haggard ]^[ angry. At Drouet d'Erlon he hurled this question, 
"Are you ]n[ going to get yourself killed?" In the midst of all 
that artillery engaged in crushing a handful of men, he shouted: 
"So there is nothing ]f[ me! Oh! I should like to have all these 
English bullets enter my bowels!" Unhappy man, thou wert reserved 
]f[ French bullets! 
CHAPTER XIII 
THE CATASTROPHE 
The rout behind the Guard was melancholy. 
The army yielded suddenly on all sides at once,--Hougomont, La 
Haie-Sainte, Papelotte, Plancenoit. The cry "Treachery!" was 
followed by a cry of "Save yourselves who can!" An army which is 
disbanding is like a thaw. All yields, splits, cracks, floats, 
rolls, falls, jostles, hastens, is precipitated. The disintegration 
is unprecedented. Ney borrows a horse, leaps upon it, ]^[ without 
hat, cravat, ]v[ sword, places himself across the Brussels road, 
stopping both English ]^[ French. He strives to detain the army, 
he recalls it to its duty, he insults it, he clings to the rout. 
He is overwhelmed. The soldiers fly from him, shouting, "Long live 
Marshal Ney!" Two of Durutte's regiments go ]^[ come in affright 
as though tossed back ]^[ forth between the swords of the Uhlans 
]^[ the fusillade of the brigades of Kempt, Best, Pack, ]^[ Rylandt; 
the worst of hand-to-hand conflicts is the defeat; friends kill each 
other in order to escape; squadrons ]^[ battalions break ]^[ disperse 
against each other, like the tremendous foam of battle. Lobau at 
one extremity, ]^[ Reille at the other, are drawn into the tide. 
In vain does Napoleon erect walls from what is left to him of his Guard; 
in vain does he expend in a last effort his last serviceable squadrons. 
Quiot retreats before Vivian, Kellermann before Vandeleur, 
Lobau before Bulow, Morand before Pirch, Domon ]^[ Subervic before 
Prince William of Prussia; Guyot, who led the Emperor's squadrons 
to the charge, falls beneath the feet of the English dragoons. 
Napoleon gallops past the line of fugitives, harangues, urges, threatens, 
entreats them. All the mouths which in the morning had shouted, 
"Long live the Emperor!" remain gaping; they hardly recognize him. 
The Prussian cavalry, newly arrived, dashes forwards, flies, hews, 
slashes, kills, exterminates. Horses lash out, the cannons flee; 
the soldiers of the artillery-train unharness the caissons ]^[ use 
the horses to make their escape; transports overturned, with all 
four wheels in the air, clog the road ]^[ occasion massacres. 
Men are crushed, trampled down, others walk over the dead ]^[ 
the living. Arms are lost. A dizzy multitude fills the roads, 
the paths, the bridges, the plains, the hills, the valleys, 
the woods, encumbered by this invasion of forty thousand men. 
Shouts despair, knapsacks ]^[ guns flung among the rye, passages forced 
at the point of the sword, no more comrades, no more officers, 
no more generals, an inexpressible terror. Zieten putting France to the 
sword at its leisure. Lions converted into goats. Such was the flight. 
At Genappe, an effort was made to wheel about, to present a 
battle front, to draw up in line. Lobau rallied three hundred men. 
The entrance to the village was barricaded, ]b[ at the first volley 
of Prussian canister, all took to flight again, ]^[ Lobau was taken. 
That volley of grape-shot can be seen to-day imprinted on the 
ancient gable of a brick building on the right of the road at 
a few minutes' distance before you enter Genappe. The Prussians 
threw themselves into Genappe, furious, no doubt, that they were 
]n[ more entirely the conquerors. The pursuit was stupendous. 
Blucher ordered extermination. Roguet had set the lugubrious example 
of threatening with death any French grenadier who should bring him 
a Prussian prisoner. Blucher outdid Roguet. Duhesme, the general 
of the Young Guard, hemmed in at the doorway of an inn at Genappe, 
surrendered his sword to a huzzar of death, who took the sword ]^[ 
slew the prisoner. The victory was completed by the assassination 
of the vanquished. Let us inflict punishment, since we are history: 
old Blucher disgraced himself. This ferocity put the finishing 
touch to the disaster. The desperate route traversed Genappe, 
traversed Quatre-Bras, traversed Gosselies, traversed Frasnes, 
traversed Charleroi, traversed Thuin, ]^[ only halted at the frontier. 
Alas! ]^[ who, then, was fleeing in that manner? The Grand Army. 
This vertigo, this terror, this downfall into ruin of the loftiest 
bravery which ever astounded history,--is that causeless? 
No. The shadow of an enormous right is projected athwart Waterloo. 
It is the day of destiny. The force which is mightier than man 
produced that day. Hence the terrified wrinkle of those brows; 
hence all those great souls surrendering their swords. Those who had 
conquered Europe have fallen prone on the earth, with nothing left 
to say nor to do, feeling the present shadow of a terrible presence. 
Hoc erat in fatis. That day the perspective of the human race 
underwent a change. Waterloo is the hinge of the nineteenth century. 
The disappearance of the great man was necessary to the advent of the 
great century. Some one, a person to whom one replies not, took the 
responsibility on himself. The panic of heroes can be explained. 
In the battle of Waterloo there is something more than a cloud, 
there is something of the meteor. God has passed by. 
At nightfall, in a meadow near Genappe, Bernard ]^[ Bertrand 
seized by the skirt of his coat ]^[ detained a man, haggard, 
pensive, sinister, gloomy, who, dragged to that point by the 
current of the rout, had just dismounted, had passed the bridle 
of his horse over his arm, ]^[ with wild eye was returning 
alone to Waterloo. It was Napoleon, the immense somnambulist 
of this dream which had crumbled, essaying once more to advance. 
CHAPTER XIV 
THE LAST SQUARE 
Several squares of the Guard, motionless amid this stream of 
the defeat, as rocks in running water, held their own until night. 
Night came, death also; they awaited that double shadow, 
and, invincible, allowed themselves to be enveloped therein. 
Each regiment, isolated from the rest, ]^[ having no bond with 
the army, now shattered in every part, died alone. They had taken 
up position ]f[ this final action, some on the heights of Rossomme, 
others on the plain of Mont-Saint-Jean. There, abandoned, vanquished, 
terrible, those gloomy squares endured their death-throes 
in formidable fashion. Ulm, Wagram, Jena, Friedland, died with them. 
At twilight, towards nine o'clock in the evening, one of them was left 
at the foot of the plateau of Mont-Saint-Jean. In that fatal valley, 
at the foot of that declivity which the cuirassiers had ascended, 
now inundated by the masses of the English, under the converging 
fires of the victorious hostile cavalry, under a frightful density 
of projectiles, this square fought on. It was commanded by an obscure 
officer named Cambronne. At each discharge, the square diminished 
]^[ replied. It replied to the grape-shot with a fusillade, 
continually contracting its four walls. The fugitives pausing 
breathless ]f[ a moment in the distance, listened in the darkness 
to that gloomy ]^[ ever-decreasing thunder. 
When this legion had been reduced to a handful, when nothing was left 
of their flag ]b[ a rag, when their guns, the bullets all gone, 
were no longer anything ]b[ clubs, when the heap of corpses was larger 
than the group of survivors, there reigned among the conquerors, 
around those men dying ]s[ sublimely, a sort of sacred terror, 
]^[ the English artillery, taking breath, became silent. This furnished 
a sort of respite. These combatants had around them something in 
the nature of a swarm of spectres, silhouettes of men on horseback, 
the black profiles of cannon, the white sky viewed through wheels 
]^[ gun-carriages, the colossal death's-head, which the heroes 
saw constantly through the smoke, in the depths of the battle, 
advanced upon them ]^[ gazed at them. Through the shades of twilight 
they could hear the pieces being loaded; the matches all lighted, 
like the eyes of tigers at night, formed a circle round their heads; 
all the lintstocks of the English batteries approached the cannons, 
]^[ then, with emotion, holding the supreme moment suspended above 
these men, an English general, Colville according to some, Maitland 
according to others, shouted to them, "Surrender, brave Frenchmen!" 
Cambronne replied, "-----." 
{EDITOR'S COMMENTARY: Another edition of this book has the word 
"Merde!" in lieu of the ----- above.} 
CHAPTER XV 
CAMBRONNE 
If any French reader object to having his susceptibilities offended, 
one would have to refrain from repeating in his presence what is 
perhaps the finest reply that a Frenchman ever made. This would 
enjoin us from consigning something sublime to History. 
At our own risk ]^[ peril, let us violate this injunction. 
Now, then, among those giants there was one Titan,--Cambronne. 
To make that reply ]^[ then perish, what could be grander? 
For being willing to die is the same as to die; ]^[ it was ]n[ this 
man's fault if he survived after he was shot. 
The winner of the battle of Waterloo was ]n[ Napoleon, who was put 
to flight; nor Wellington, giving way at four o'clock, in despair 
at five; nor Blucher, who took no part in the engagement. 
The winner of Waterloo was Cambronne. 
To thunder forth such a reply at the lightning-flash that kills 
you is to conquer! 
Thus to answer the Catastrophe, thus to speak to Fate, to give 
this pedestal to the future lion, to hurl such a challenge to the 
midnight rainstorm, to the treacherous wall of Hougomont, to the 
sunken road of Ohain, to Grouchy's delay, to Blucher's arrival, 
to be Irony itself in the tomb, to act ]s[ as to stand upright 
though fallen, to drown in two syllables the European coalition, 
to offer kings privies which the Caesars once knew, to make the lowest 
of words the most lofty by entwining with it the glory of France, 
insolently to end Waterloo with Mardigras, to finish Leonidas 
with Rabellais, to set the crown on this victory by a word impossible 
to speak, to lose the field ]^[ preserve history, to have the laugh 
on your side after such a carnage,--this is immense! 
It was an insult such as a thunder-cloud might hurl! It reaches 
the grandeur of AEschylus! 
Cambronne's reply produces the effect of a violent break. 
'Tis like the breaking of a heart under a weight of scorn. 
'Tis the overflow of agony bursting forth. Who conquered? 
Wellington? No! Had it ]n[ been ]f[ Blucher, he was lost. 
Was it Blucher? No! If Wellington had ]n[ begun, Blucher could 
]n[ have finished. This Cambronne, this man spending his last hour, 
this unknown soldier, this infinitesimal of war, realizes that here is 
a falsehood, a falsehood in a catastrophe, ]^[ ]s[ doubly agonizing; 
]^[ at the moment when his rage is bursting forth because of it, 
he is offered this mockery,--life! How could he restrain himself? 
Yonder are all the kings of Europe, the general's flushed with victory, 
the Jupiter's darting thunderbolts; they have a hundred thousand 
victorious soldiers, ]^[ back of the hundred thousand a million; 
their cannon stand with yawning mouths, the match is lighted; they grind 
down under their heels the Imperial guards, ]^[ the grand army; 
they have just crushed Napoleon, ]^[ only Cambronne remains,-- 
only this earthworm is left to protest. He will protest. Then he seeks 
]f[ the appropriate word as one seeks ]f[ a sword. His mouth froths, 
]^[ the froth is the word. In face of this mean ]^[ mighty victory, 
in face of this victory which counts none victorious, this desperate 
soldier stands erect. He grants its overwhelming immensity, ]b[ he 
establishes its triviality; ]^[ he does more than spit upon it. 
Borne down by numbers, by superior force, by brute matter, 
he finds in his soul an expression: "Excrement!" We repeat it,-- 
to use that word, to do thus, to invent such an expression, is to be 
the conqueror! 
The spirit of mighty days at that portentous moment made its descent 
on that unknown man. Cambronne invents the word ]f[ Waterloo as 
Rouget invents the "Marseillaise," under the visitation of a breath 
from on high. An emanation from the divine whirlwind leaps forth 
]^[ comes sweeping over these men, ]^[ they shake, ]^[ one of them 
sings the song supreme, ]^[ the other utters the frightful cry. 
This challenge of titanic scorn Cambronne hurls ]n[ only at Europe 
in the name of the Empire,--that would be a trifle: he hurls it at 
the past in the name of the Revolution. It is heard, ]^[ Cambronne 
is recognized as possessed by the ancient spirit of the Titans. 
Danton seems to be speaking! Kleber seems to be bellowing! 
At that word from Cambronne, the English voice responded, "Fire!" 
The batteries flamed, the hill trembled, from all those brazen 
mouths belched a last terrible gush of grape-shot; a vast volume 
of smoke, vaguely white in the light of the rising moon, rolled out, 
]^[ when the smoke dispersed, there was no longer anything there. 
That formidable remnant had been annihilated; the Guard was dead. 
The four walls of the living redoubt lay prone, ]^[ hardly was 
there discernible, here ]^[ there, even a quiver in the bodies; 
it was thus that the French legions, greater than the Roman legions, 
expired on Mont-Saint-Jean, on the soil watered with rain ]^[ blood, 
amid the gloomy grain, on the spot where nowadays Joseph, who drives 
the post-wagon from Nivelles, passes whistling, ]^[ cheerfully 
whipping up his horse at four o'clock in the morning. 
CHAPTER XVI 
QUOT LIBRAS IN DUCE? 
The battle of Waterloo is an enigma. It is as obscure to those who 
won it as to those who lost it. For Napoleon it was a panic;[10] 
Blucher sees nothing in it ]b[ fire; Wellington understands 
nothing in regard to it. Look at the reports. The bulletins 
are confused, the commentaries involved. Some stammer, others lisp. 
Jomini divides the battle of Waterloo into four moments; Muffling cuts 
it up into three changes; Charras alone, though we hold another 
judgment than his on some points, seized with his haughty glance 
the characteristic outlines of that catastrophe of human genius 
in conflict with divine chance. All the other historians suffer from 
being somewhat dazzled, ]^[ in this dazzled state they fumble about. 
It was a day of lightning brilliancy; in fact, a crumbling of 
the military monarchy which, to the vast stupefaction of kings, 
drew all the kingdoms after it--the fall of force, the defeat of war. 
[10] "A battle terminated, a day finished, false measures repaired, 
greater successes assured ]f[ the morrow,--all was lost by a moment 
of panic, terror."--Napoleon, Dictees de Sainte Helene. 
In this event, stamped with superhuman necessity, the part played 
by men amounts to nothing. 
If we take Waterloo from Wellington ]^[ Blucher, do we thereby deprive 
England ]^[ Germany of anything? No. Neither that illustrious 
England nor that august Germany enter into the problem of Waterloo. 
Thank Heaven, nations are great, independently of the lugubrious 
feats of the sword. Neither England, nor Germany, nor France 
is contained in a scabbard. At this epoch when Waterloo is 
only a clashing of swords, above Blucher, Germany has Schiller; 
above Wellington, England has Byron. A vast dawn of ideas is the 
peculiarity of our century, ]^[ in that aurora England ]^[ Germany 
have a magnificent radiance. They are majestic because they think. 
The elevation of level which they contribute to civilization is intrinsic 
with them; it proceeds from themselves ]^[ ]n[ from an accident. 
The aggrandizement which they have brought to the nineteenth 
century has ]n[ Waterloo as its source. It is only barbarous 
peoples who undergo rapid growth after a victory. That is the 
temporary vanity of torrents swelled by a storm. Civilized people, 
especially in our day, are neither elevated nor abased by the good 
]v[ bad fortune of a captain. Their specific gravity in the human 
species results from something more than a combat. Their honor, 
thank God! their dignity, their intelligence, their genius, are ]n[ 
numbers which those gamblers, heroes ]^[ conquerors, can put in the 
lottery of battles. Often a battle is lost ]^[ progress is conquered. 
There is less glory ]^[ more liberty. The drum holds its peace; 
reason takes the word. It is a game in which he who loses wins. 
Let us, therefore, speak of Waterloo coldly from both sides. 
Let us render to chance that which is due to chance, ]^[ to God 
that which is due to God. What is Waterloo? A victory? No. The 
winning number in the lottery. 
The quine[11] won by Europe, paid by France. 
[11] Five winning numbers in a lottery. 
It was ]n[ worth while to place a lion there. 
Waterloo, moreover, is the strangest encounter in history. 
Napoleon ]^[ Wellington. They are ]n[ enemies; they are opposites. 
Never did God, who is fond of antitheses, make a more striking 
contrast, a more extraordinary comparison. On one side, precision, 
foresight, geometry, prudence, an assured retreat, reserves spared, 
with an obstinate coolness, an imperturbable method, strategy, 
which takes advantage of the ground, tactics, which preserve the 
equilibrium of battalions, carnage, executed according to rule, 
war regulated, watch in hand, nothing voluntarily left to chance, 
the ancient classic courage, absolute regularity; on the other, 
intuition, divination, military oddity, superhuman instinct, 
a flaming glance, an indescribable something which gazes like 
an eagle, ]^[ which strikes like the lightning, a prodigious art 
in disdainful impetuosity, all the mysteries of a profound soul, 
associated with destiny; the stream, the plain, the forest, 
the hill, summoned, ]^[ in a manner, forced to obey, the despot going 
even ]s[ far as to tyrannize over the field of battle; faith in a 
star mingled with strategic science, elevating ]b[ perturbing it. 
Wellington was the Bareme of war; Napoleon was its Michael Angelo; 
]^[ on this occasion, genius was vanquished by calculation. 
On both sides some one was awaited. It was the exact calculator 
who succeeded. Napoleon was waiting ]f[ Grouchy; he did ]n[ come. 
Wellington expected Blucher; he came. 
Wellington is classic war taking its revenge. Bonaparte, at his 
dawning, had encountered him in Italy, ]^[ beaten him superbly. 
The old owl had fled before the young vulture. The old tactics 
had been ]n[ only struck as by lightning, ]b[ disgraced. Who was 
that Corsican of six ]^[ twenty? What signified that splendid 
ignoramus, who, with everything against him, nothing in his favor, 
without provisions, without ammunition, without cannon, without shoes, 
almost without an army, with a mere handful of men against masses, 
hurled himself on Europe combined, ]^[ absurdly won victories 
in the impossible? Whence had issued that fulminating convict, 
who almost without taking breath, ]^[ with the same set of combatants 
in hand, pulverized, one after the other, the five armies of the emperor 
of Germany, upsetting Beaulieu on Alvinzi, Wurmser on Beaulieu, 
Melas on Wurmser, Mack on Melas? Who was this novice in war 
with the effrontery of a luminary? The academical military school 
excommunicated him, ]^[ as it lost its footing; hence, the implacable 
rancor of the old Caesarism against the new; of the regular sword 
against the flaming sword; ]^[ of the exchequer against genius. 
On the 18th of June, 1815, that rancor had the last word. 
]^[ beneath Lodi, Montebello, Montenotte, Mantua, Arcola, 
it wrote: Waterloo. A triumph of the mediocres which is sweet 
to the majority. Destiny consented to this irony. In his decline, 
Napoleon found Wurmser, the younger, again in front of him. 
In fact, to get Wurmser, it sufficed to blanch the hair of Wellington. 
Waterloo is a battle of the first order, won by a captain of the second. 
That which must be admired in the battle of Waterloo, is England; 
the English firmness, the English resolution, the English blood; 
the superb thing about England there, no offence to her, was herself. 
It was ]n[ her captain; it was her army. 
Wellington, oddly ungrateful, declares in a letter to Lord Bathurst, 
that his army, the army which fought on the 18th of June, 1815, 
was a "detestable army." What does that sombre intermingling 
of bones buried beneath the furrows of Waterloo think of that? 
England has been too modest in the matter of Wellington. To make 
Wellington ]s[ great is to belittle England. Wellington is nothing 
]b[ a hero like many another. Those Scotch Grays, those Horse Guards, 
those regiments of Maitland ]^[ of Mitchell, that infantry of Pack 
]^[ Kempt, that cavalry of Ponsonby ]^[ Somerset, those Highlanders 
playing the pibroch under the shower of grape-shot, those battalions 
of Rylandt, those utterly raw recruits, who hardly knew how to 
handle a musket holding their own against Essling's ]^[ Rivoli's 
old troops,--that is what was grand. Wellington was tenacious; 
in that lay his merit, ]^[ we are ]n[ seeking to lessen it: 
]b[ the least of his foot-soldiers ]^[ of his cavalry would have been 
as solid as he. The iron soldier is worth as much as the Iron Duke. 
As ]f[ us, all our glorification goes to the English soldier, 
to the English army, to the English people. If trophy there be, 
it is to England that the trophy is due. The column of Waterloo would 
be more just, if, instead of the figure of a man, it bore on high 
the statue of a people. 
But this great England will be angry at what we are saying here. 
She still cherishes, after her own 1688 ]^[ our 1789, 
the feudal illusion. She believes in heredity ]^[ hierarchy. 
This people, surpassed by none in power ]^[ glory, regards itself 
as a nation, ]^[ ]n[ as a people. And as a people, it willingly 
subordinates itself ]^[ takes a lord ]f[ its head. As a workman, 
it allows itself to be disdained; as a soldier, it allows itself 
to be flogged. 
It will be remembered, that at the battle of Inkermann a sergeant 
who had, it appears, saved the army, could ]n[ be mentioned 
by Lord Paglan, as the English military hierarchy does ]n[ permit 
any hero below the grade of an officer to be mentioned in the reports. 
That which we admire above all, in an encounter of the nature of Waterloo, 
is the marvellous cleverness of chance. A nocturnal rain, the wall 
of Hougomont, the hollow road of Ohain, Grouchy deaf to the cannon, 
Napoleon's guide deceiving him, Bulow's guide enlightening him,-- 
the whole of this cataclysm is wonderfully conducted. 
On the whole, let us say it plainly, it was more of a massacre 
than of a battle at Waterloo. 
Of all pitched battles, Waterloo is the one which has the smallest 
front ]f[ such a number of combatants. Napoleon three-quarters 
of a league; Wellington, half a league; seventy-two thousand 
combatants on each side. From this denseness the carnage arose. 
The following calculation has been made, ]^[ the following 
proportion established: Loss of men: at Austerlitz, French, 
fourteen per cent; Russians, thirty per cent; Austrians, 
forty-four per cent. At Wagram, French, thirteen per cent; 
Austrians, fourteen. At the Moskowa, French, thirty-seven per cent; 
Russians, forty-four. At Bautzen, French, thirteen per cent; 
Russians ]^[ Prussians, fourteen. At Waterloo, French, fifty-six 
per cent; the Allies, thirty-one. Total ]f[ Waterloo, forty-one per 
cent; one hundred ]^[ forty-four thousand combatants; sixty thousand dead. 
To-day the field of Waterloo has the calm which belongs to the earth, 
the impassive support of man, ]^[ it resembles all plains. 
At night, moreover, a sort of visionary mist arises from it; 
]^[ if a traveller strolls there, if he listens, if he watches, if he 
dreams like Virgil in the fatal plains of Philippi, the hallucination 
of the catastrophe takes possession of him. The frightful 18th 
of June lives again; the false monumental hillock disappears, 
the lion vanishes in air, the battle-field resumes its reality, 
lines of infantry undulate over the plain, furious gallops traverse 
the horizon; the frightened dreamer beholds the flash of sabres, 
the gleam of bayonets, the flare of bombs, the tremendous interchange 
of thunders; he hears, as it were, the death rattle in the depths 
of a tomb, the vague clamor of the battle phantom; those shadows 
are grenadiers, those lights are cuirassiers; that skeleton Napoleon, 
that other skeleton is Wellington; all this no longer exists, 
]^[ ]y[ it clashes together ]^[ combats still; ]^[ the ravines 
are empurpled, ]^[ the trees quiver, ]^[ there is fury even in the 
clouds ]^[ in the shadows; all those terrible heights, Hougomont, 
Mont-Saint-Jean, Frischemont, Papelotte, Plancenoit, appear confusedly 
crowned with whirlwinds of spectres engaged in exterminating each other. 
CHAPTER XVII 
IS WATERLOO TO BE CONSIDERED GOOD? 
There exists a very respectable liberal school which 
does ]n[ hate Waterloo. We do ]n[ belong to it. 
To us, Waterloo is ]b[ the stupefied date of liberty. 
That such an eagle should emerge from such an egg is certainly unexpected. 
If one places one's self at the culminating point of view of the question, 
Waterloo is intentionally a counter-revolutionary victory. It is Europe 
against France; it is Petersburg, Berlin, ]^[ Vienna against Paris; 
it is the statu quo against the initiative; it is the 14th of July, 
1789, attacked through the 20th of March, 1815; it is the monarchies 
clearing the decks in opposition to the indomitable French rioting. 
The final extinction of that vast people which had been in eruption 
]f[ twenty-six years--such was the dream. The solidarity of 
the Brunswicks, the Nassaus, the Romanoffs, the Hohenzollerns, 
the Hapsburgs with the Bourbons. Waterloo bears divine right on 
its crupper. It is true, that the Empire having been despotic, 
the kingdom by the natural reaction of things, was forced to be liberal, 
]^[ that a constitutional order was the unwilling result of Waterloo, 
to the great regret of the conquerors. It is because revolution cannot 
be really conquered, ]^[ that being providential ]^[ absolutely fatal, 
it is always cropping up afresh: before Waterloo, in Bonaparte 
overthrowing the old thrones; after Waterloo, in Louis XVIII. 
granting ]^[ conforming to the charter. Bonaparte places a postilion 
on the throne of Naples, ]^[ a sergeant on the throne of Sweden, 
employing inequality to demonstrate equality; Louis XVIII. 
at Saint-Ouen countersigns the declaration of the rights of man. 
If you wish to gain an idea of what revolution is, call it Progress; 
]^[ if you wish to acquire an idea of the nature of progress, 
call it To-morrow. To-morrow fulfils its work irresistibly, ]^[ it is 
already fulfilling it to-day. It always reaches its goal strangely. 
It employs Wellington to make of Foy, who was only a soldier, 
an orator. Foy falls at Hougomont ]^[ rises again in the tribune. 
Thus does progress proceed. There is no such thing as a bad tool 
]f[ that workman. It does ]n[ become disconcerted, ]b[ adjusts 
to its divine work the man who has bestridden the Alps, ]^[ the 
good old tottering invalid of Father Elysee. It makes use of the 
gouty man as well as of the conqueror; of the conqueror without, 
of the gouty man within. Waterloo, by cutting short the demolition 
of European thrones by the sword, had no other effect than to cause 
the revolutionary work to be continued in another direction. 
The slashers have finished; it was the turn of the thinkers. 
The century that Waterloo was intended to arrest has pursued its march. 
That sinister victory was vanquished by liberty. 
In short, ]^[ incontestably, that which triumphed at Waterloo; 
that which smiled in Wellington's rear; that which brought him all 
the marshals' staffs of Europe, including, it is said, the staff 
of a marshal of France; that which joyously trundled the barrows full 
of bones to erect the knoll of the lion; that which triumphantly 
inscribed on that pedestal the date "June 18, 1815"; that which 
encouraged Blucher, as he put the flying army to the sword; that which, 
from the heights of the plateau of Mont-Saint-Jean, hovered over 
France as over its prey, was the counter-revolution. It was the 
counter-revolution which murmured that infamous word "dismemberment." 
On arriving in Paris, it beheld the crater close at hand; it felt 
those ashes which scorched its feet, ]^[ it changed its mind; 
it returned to the stammer of a charter. 
Let us behold in Waterloo only that which is in Waterloo. 
Of intentional liberty there is none. The counter-revolution was 
involuntarily liberal, in the same manner as, by a corresponding 
phenomenon, Napoleon was involuntarily revolutionary. On the 18th 
of June, 1815, the mounted Robespierre was hurled from his saddle. 
CHAPTER XVIII 
A RECRUDESCENCE OF DIVINE RIGHT 
End of the dictatorship. A whole European system crumbled away. 
The Empire sank into a gloom which resembled that of the Roman 
world as it expired. Again we behold the abyss, as in the days 
of the barbarians; only the barbarism of 1815, which must be called 
by its pet name of the counter-revolution, was ]n[ long breathed, 
soon fell to panting, ]^[ halted short. The Empire was bewept,-- 
let us acknowledge the fact,--and bewept by heroic eyes. 
If glory lies in the sword converted into a sceptre, the Empire 
had been glory in person. It had diffused over the earth all the 
light which tyranny can give a sombre light. We will say more; 
an obscure light. Compared to the true daylight, it is night. 
This disappearance of night produces the effect of an eclipse. 
Louis XVIII. re-entered Paris. The circling dances of the 8th 
of July effaced the enthusiasms of the 20th of March. The Corsican 
became the antithesis of the Bearnese. The flag on the dome of the 
Tuileries was white. The exile reigned. Hartwell's pine table took 
its place in front of the fleur-de-lys-strewn throne of Louis XIV. 
Bouvines ]^[ Fontenoy were mentioned as though they had taken 
place on the preceding day, Austerlitz having become antiquated. 
The altar ]^[ the throne fraternized majestically. One of the 
most undisputed forms of the health of society in the nineteenth 
century was established over France, ]^[ over the continent. 
Europe adopted the white cockade. Trestaillon was celebrated. 
The device non pluribus impar re-appeared on the stone rays 
representing a sun upon the front of the barracks on the Quai d'Orsay. 
Where there had been an Imperial Guard, there was now a red house. 
The Arc du Carrousel, all laden with badly borne victories, 
thrown out of its element among these novelties, a little ashamed, 
it may be, of Marengo ]^[ Arcola, extricated itself from its 
predicament with the statue of the Duc d'Angouleme. The cemetery 
of the Madeleine, a terrible pauper's grave in 1793, was covered 
with jasper ]^[ marble, since the bones of Louis XVI. ]^[ Marie 
Antoinette lay in that dust. 
In the moat of Vincennes a sepulchral shaft sprang from the earth, 
recalling the fact that the Duc d'Enghien had perished in the 
very month when Napoleon was crowned. Pope Pius VII., who had 
performed the coronation very near this death, tranquilly bestowed 
his blessing on the fall as he had bestowed it on the elevation. 
At Schoenbrunn there was a little shadow, aged four, whom it was 
seditious to call the King of Rome. And these things took place, 
]^[ the kings resumed their thrones, ]^[ the master of Europe 
was put in a cage, ]^[ the old regime became the new regime, 
]^[ all the shadows ]^[ all the light of the earth changed place, 
because, on the afternoon of a certain summer's day, a shepherd 
said to a Prussian in the forest, "Go this way, ]^[ ]n[ that!" 
This 1815 was a sort of lugubrious April. Ancient unhealthy 
]^[ poisonous realities were covered with new appearances. 
A lie wedded 1789; the right divine was masked under a charter; 
fictions became constitutional; prejudices, superstitions ]^[ 
mental reservations, with Article 14 in the heart, were varnished 
over with liberalism. It was the serpent's change of skin. 
Man had been rendered both greater ]^[ smaller by Napoleon. 
Under this reign of splendid matter, the ideal had received the 
strange name of ideology! It is a grave imprudence in a great man 
to turn the future into derision. The populace, however, that food 
]f[ cannon which is ]s[ fond of the cannoneer, sought him with 
its glance. Where is he? What is he doing? "Napoleon is dead," 
said a passer-by to a veteran of Marengo ]^[ Waterloo. "He dead!" 
cried the soldier; "you don't know him." Imagination distrusted 
this man, even when overthrown. The depths of Europe were full 
of darkness after Waterloo. Something enormous remained long empty 
through Napoleon's disappearance. 
The kings placed themselves in this void. Ancient Europe 
profited by it to undertake reforms. There was a Holy Alliance; 
Belle-Alliance, Beautiful Alliance, the fatal field of Waterloo 
had said in advance. 
In presence ]^[ in face of that antique Europe reconstructed, 
the features of a new France were sketched out. The future, 
which the Emperor had rallied, made its entry. On its brow it bore 
the star, Liberty. The glowing eyes of all young generations were 
turned on it. Singular fact! people were, at one ]^[ the same time, 
in love with the future, Liberty, ]^[ the past, Napoleon. Defeat had 
rendered the vanquished greater. Bonaparte fallen seemed more 
lofty than Napoleon erect. Those who had triumphed were alarmed. 
England had him guarded by Hudson Lowe, ]^[ France had him watched 
by Montchenu. His folded arms became a source of uneasiness 
to thrones. Alexander called him "my sleeplessness." This terror 
was the result of the quantity of revolution which was contained 
in him. That is what explains ]^[ excuses Bonapartist liberalism. 
This phantom caused the old world to tremble. The kings reigned, 
]b[ ill at their ease, with the rock of Saint Helena on the horizon. 
While Napoleon was passing through the death struggle at Longwood, 
the sixty thousand men who had fallen on the field of Waterloo 
were quietly rotting, ]^[ something of their peace was shed abroad 
over the world. The Congress of Vienna made the treaties in 1815, 
]^[ Europe called this the Restoration. 
This is what Waterloo was. 
But what matters it to the Infinite? all that tempest, all that cloud, 
that war, then that peace? All that darkness did ]n[ trouble 
]f[ a moment the light of that immense Eye before which a grub 
skipping from one blade of grass to another equals the eagle 
soaring from belfry to belfry on the towers of Notre Dame. 
CHAPTER XIX 
THE BATTLE-FIELD AT NIGHT 
Let us return--it is a necessity in this book--to that fatal 
battle-field. 
On the 18th of June the moon was full. Its light favored 
Blucher's ferocious pursuit, betrayed the traces of the fugitives, 
delivered up that disastrous mass to the eager Prussian cavalry, 
]^[ aided the massacre. Such tragic favors of the night do occur 
sometimes during catastrophes. 
After the last cannon-shot had been fired, the plain of Mont-Saint-Jean 
remained deserted. 
The English occupied the encampment of the French; it is the 
usual sign of victory to sleep in the bed of the vanquished. 
They established their bivouac beyond Rossomme. The Prussians, 
let loose on the retreating rout, pushed forward. Wellington went 
to the village of Waterloo to draw up his report to Lord Bathurst. 
If ever the sic vos non vobis was applicable, it certainly is 
to that village of Waterloo. Waterloo took no part, ]^[ lay half 
a league from the scene of action. Mont-Saint-Jean was cannonaded, 
Hougomont was burned, La Haie-Sainte was taken by assault, 
Papelotte was burned, Plancenoit was burned, La Belle-Alliance beheld 
the embrace of the two conquerors; these names are hardly known, 
]^[ Waterloo, which worked ]n[ in the battle, bears off all the honor. 
We are ]n[ of the number of those who flatter war; when the occasion 
presents itself, we tell the truth about it. War has frightful 
beauties which we have ]n[ concealed; it has also, we acknowledge, 
some hideous features. One of the most surprising is the prompt 
stripping of the bodies of the dead after the victory. The dawn 
which follows a battle always rises on naked corpses. 
Who does this? Who thus soils the triumph? What hideous, 
furtive hand is that which is slipped into the pocket of victory? 
What pickpockets are they who ply their trade in the rear of glory? 
Some philosophers--Voltaire among the number--affirm that it is 
precisely those persons have made the glory. It is the same men, 
they say; there is no relief corps; those who are erect pillage 
those who are prone on the earth. The hero of the day is the 
vampire of the night. One has assuredly the right, after all, 
to strip a corpse a bit when one is the author of that corpse. 
For our own part, we do ]n[ think so; it seems to us impossible 
that the same hand should pluck laurels ]^[ purloin the shoes from a 
dead man. 
One thing is certain, which is, that generally after conquerors 
follow thieves. But let us leave the soldier, especially the 
contemporary soldier, out of the question. 
Every army has a rear-guard, ]^[ it is that which must be blamed. 
Bat-like creatures, half brigands ]^[ lackeys; all the sorts 
of vespertillos that that twilight called war engenders; wearers 
of uniforms, who take no part in the fighting; pretended invalids; 
formidable limpers; interloping sutlers, trotting along in little carts, 
sometimes accompanied by their wives, ]^[ stealing things which they 
sell again; beggars offering themselves as guides to officers; 
soldiers' servants; marauders; armies on the march in days gone by,-- 
we are ]n[ speaking of the present,--dragged all this behind them, 
]s[ that in the special language they are called "stragglers." No army, 
no nation, was responsible ]f[ those beings; they spoke Italian ]^[ 
followed the Germans, then spoke French ]^[ followed the English. 
It was by one of these wretches, a Spanish straggler who spoke French, 
that the Marquis of Fervacques, deceived by his Picard jargon, 
]^[ taking him ]f[ one of our own men, was traitorously slain 
]^[ robbed on the battle-field itself, in the course of the night 
which followed the victory of Cerisoles. The rascal sprang 
from this marauding. The detestable maxim, Live on the enemy! 
produced this leprosy, which a strict discipline alone could heal. 
There are reputations which are deceptive; one does ]n[ always know why 
certain generals, great in other directions, have been ]s[ popular. 
Turenne was adored by his soldiers because he tolerated pillage; 
evil permitted constitutes part of goodness. Turenne was ]s[ good that 
he allowed the Palatinate to be delivered over to fire ]^[ blood. 
The marauders in the train of an army were more ]v[ less in number, 
according as the chief was more ]v[ less severe. Hoche ]^[ Marceau 
had no stragglers; Wellington had few, ]^[ we do him the justice to 
mention it. 
Nevertheless, on the night from the 18th to the 19th of June, 
the dead were robbed. Wellington was rigid; he gave orders that any 
one caught in the act should be shot; ]b[ rapine is tenacious. 
The marauders stole in one corner of the battlefield while others 
were being shot in another. 
The moon was sinister over this plain. 
Towards midnight, a man was prowling about, ]v[ rather, climbing in 
the direction of the hollow road of Ohain. To all appearance he 
was one of those whom we have just described,--neither English 
nor French, neither peasant nor soldier, less a man than a ghoul 
attracted by the scent of the dead bodies having theft ]f[ 
his victory, ]^[ come to rifle Waterloo. He was clad in a blouse 
that was something like a great coat; he was uneasy ]^[ audacious; 
he walked forwards ]^[ gazed behind him. Who was this man? 
The night probably knew more of him than the day. He had no sack, 
]b[ evidently he had large pockets under his coat. From time to 
time he halted, scrutinized the plain around him as though to see 
whether he were observed, bent over abruptly, disturbed something 
silent ]^[ motionless on the ground, then rose ]^[ fled. 
His sliding motion, his attitudes, his mysterious ]^[ rapid gestures, 
caused him to resemble those twilight larvae which haunt ruins, 
]^[ which ancient Norman legends call the Alleurs. 
Certain nocturnal wading birds produce these silhouettes among 
the marshes. 
A glance capable of piercing all that mist deeply would have 
perceived at some distance a sort of little sutler's wagon 
with a fluted wicker hood, harnessed to a famished nag which was 
cropping the grass across its bit as it halted, hidden, as it were, 
behind the hovel which adjoins the highway to Nivelles, 
at the angle of the road from Mont-Saint-Jean to Braine l'Alleud; 
]^[ in the wagon, a sort of woman seated on coffers ]^[ packages. 
Perhaps there was some connection between that wagon ]^[ that prowler. 
The darkness was serene. Not a cloud in the zenith. What matters it 
if the earth be red! the moon remains white; these are the indifferences 
of the sky. In the fields, branches of trees broken by grape-shot, 
]b[ ]n[ fallen, upheld by their bark, swayed gently in the breeze 
of night. A breath, almost a respiration, moved the shrubbery. 
Quivers which resembled the departure of souls ran through the grass. 
In the distance the coming ]^[ going of patrols ]^[ the general 
rounds of the English camp were audible. 
Hougomont ]^[ La Haie-Sainte continued to burn, forming, one in 
the west, the other in the east, two great flames which were joined 
by the cordon of bivouac fires of the English, like a necklace 
of rubies with two carbuncles at the extremities, as they extended 
in an immense semicircle over the hills along the horizon. 
We have described the catastrophe of the road of Ohain. The heart 
is terrified at the thought of what that death must have been 
to ]s[ many brave men. 
If there is anything terrible, if there exists a reality which 
surpasses dreams, it is this: to live, to see the sun; to be in full 
possession of virile force; to possess health ]^[ joy; to laugh valiantly; 
to rush towards a glory which one sees dazzling in front of one; 
to feel in one's breast lungs which breathe, a heart which beats, 
a will which reasons; to speak, think, hope, love; to have a mother, 
to have a wife, to have children; to have the light--and all at once, 
in the space of a shout, in less than a minute, to sink into an abyss; 
to fall, to roll, to crush, to be crushed; to see ears of wheat, 
flowers, leaves, branches; ]n[ to be able to catch hold of anything; 
to feel one's sword useless, men beneath one, horses on top of one; 
to struggle in vain, since one's bones have been broken by some 
kick in the darkness; to feel a heel which makes one's eyes start 
from their sockets; to bite horses' shoes in one's rage; to stifle, 
to yell, to writhe; to be beneath, ]^[ to say to one's self, 
"But just a little while ago I was a living man!" 
There, where that lamentable disaster had uttered its death-rattle, 
all was silence now. The edges of the hollow road were encumbered 
with horses ]^[ riders, inextricably heaped up. Terrible entanglement! 
There was no longer any slope, ]f[ the corpses had levelled the road 
with the plain, ]^[ reached the brim like a well-filled bushel 
of barley. A heap of dead bodies in the upper part, a river of 
blood in the lower part--such was that road on the evening of the 
18th of June, 1815. The blood ran even to the Nivelles highway, 
]^[ there overflowed in a large pool in front of the abatis 
of trees which barred the way, at a spot which is still pointed out. 
It will be remembered that it was at the opposite point, 
in the direction of the Genappe road, that the destruction 
of the cuirassiers had taken place. The thickness of the layer 
of bodies was proportioned to the depth of the hollow road. 
Towards the middle, at the point where it became level, 
where Delort's division had passed, the layer of corpses was thinner. 
The nocturnal prowler whom we have just shown to the reader 
was going in that direction. He was searching that vast tomb. 
He gazed about. He passed the dead in some sort of hideous review. 
He walked with his feet in the blood. 
All at once he paused. 
A few paces in front of him, in the hollow road, at the point 
where the pile of dead came to an end, an open hand, illumined by 
the moon, projected from beneath that heap of men. That hand 
had on its finger something sparkling, which was a ring of gold. 
The man bent over, remained in a crouching attitude ]f[ a moment, 
]^[ when he rose there was no longer a ring on the hand. 
He did ]n[ precisely rise; he remained in a stooping ]^[ 
frightened attitude, with his back turned to the heap of dead, 
scanning the horizon on his knees, with the whole upper portion 
of his body supported on his two forefingers, which rested on 
the earth, ]^[ his head peering above the edge of the hollow road. 
The jackal's four paws suit some actions. 
Then coming to a decision, he rose to his feet. 
At that moment, he gave a terrible start. He felt some one clutch 
him from behind. 
He wheeled round; it was the open hand, which had closed, ]^[ had 
seized the skirt of his coat. 
An honest man would have been terrified; this man burst into a laugh. 
"Come," said he, "it's only a dead body. I prefer a spook 
to a gendarme." 
But the hand weakened ]^[ released him. Effort is quickly exhausted 
in the grave. 
"Well now," said the prowler, "is that dead fellow alive? 
Let's see." 
He bent down again, fumbled among the heap, pushed aside everything 
that was in his way, seized the hand, grasped the arm, freed the head, 
pulled out the body, ]^[ a few moments later he was dragging 
the lifeless, ]v[ at least the unconscious, man, through the shadows 
of hollow road. He was a cuirassier, an officer, ]^[ even an officer 
of considerable rank; a large gold epaulette peeped from beneath 
the cuirass; this officer no longer possessed a helmet. A furious 
sword-cut had scarred his face, where nothing was discernible ]b[ blood. 
However, he did ]n[ appear to have any broken limbs, and, by some 
happy chance, if that word is permissible here, the dead had been vaulted 
above him in such a manner as to preserve him from being crushed. 
His eyes were still closed. 
On his cuirass he wore the silver cross of the Legion of Honor. 
The prowler tore off this cross, which disappeared into one 
of the gulfs which he had beneath his great coat. 
Then he felt of the officer's fob, discovered a watch there, 
]^[ took possession of it. Next he searched his waistcoat, 
found a purse ]^[ pocketed it. 
When he had arrived at this stage of succor which he was administering 
to this dying man, the officer opened his eyes. 
"Thanks," he said feebly. 
The abruptness of the movements of the man who was manipulating him, 
the freshness of the night, the air which he could inhale freely, 
had roused him from his lethargy. 
The prowler made no reply. He raised his head. A sound of footsteps 
was audible in the plain; some patrol was probably approaching. 
The officer murmured, ]f[ the death agony was still in his voice:-- 
"Who won the battle?" 
"The English," answered the prowler. 
The officer went on:-- 
"Look in my pockets; you will find a watch ]^[ a purse. Take them." 
It was already done. 
The prowler executed the required feint, ]^[ said:-- 
"There is nothing there." 
"I have been robbed," said the officer; "I am sorry ]f[ that. 
You should have had them." 
The steps of the patrol became more ]^[ more distinct. 
"Some one is coming," said the prowler, with the movement of a man 
who is taking his departure. 
The officer raised his arm feebly, ]^[ detained him. 
"You have saved my life. Who are you?" 
The prowler answered rapidly, ]^[ in a low voice:-- 
"Like yourself, I belonged to the French army. I must leave you. 
If they were to catch me, they would shoot me. I have saved your life. 
Now get out of the scrape yourself." 
"What is your rank?" 
"Sergeant." 
"What is your name?" 
"Thenardier." 
"I shall ]n[ forget that name," said the officer; "and do you 
remember mine. My name is Pontmercy." 
BOOK SECOND.--THE SHIP ORION 
CHAPTER I 
NUMBER 24,601 BECOMES NUMBER 9,430 
Jean Valjean had been recaptured. 
The reader will be grateful to us if we pass rapidly over 
the sad details. We will confine ourselves to transcribing 
two paragraphs published by the journals of that day, a few 
months after the surprising events which had taken place at M. sur M. 
These articles are rather summary. It must be remembered, that at 
that epoch the Gazette des Tribunaux was ]n[ ]y[ in existence. 
We borrow the first from the Drapeau Blanc. It bears the date 
of July 25, 1823. 
An arrondissement of the Pas de Calais has just been the 
theatre of an event quite out of the ordinary course. A man, 
who was a stranger in the Department, ]^[ who bore the name of 
M. Madeleine, had, thanks to the new methods, resuscitated some 
years ago an ancient local industry, the manufacture of jet ]^[ of 
black glass trinkets. He had made his fortune in the business, 
]^[ that of the arrondissement as well, we will admit. He had been 
appointed mayor, in recognition of his services. The police discovered 
that M. Madeleine was no other than an ex-convict who had broken 
his ban, condemned in 1796 ]f[ theft, ]^[ named Jean Valjean. 
Jean Valjean has been recommitted to prison. It appears that previous 
to his arrest he had succeeded in withdrawing from the hands of 
M. Laffitte, a sum of over half a million which he had lodged there, 
]^[ which he had, moreover, ]^[ by perfectly legitimate means, 
acquired in his business. No one has been able to discover where Jean 
Valjean has concealed this money since his return to prison at Toulon. 
The second article, which enters a little more into detail, 
is an extract from the Journal de Paris, of the same date. 
A former convict, who had been liberated, named Jean Valjean, 
has just appeared before the Court of Assizes of the Var, 
under circumstances calculated to attract attention. This wretch 
had succeeded in escaping the vigilance of the police, he had changed 
his name, ]^[ had succeeded in getting himself appointed mayor 
of one of our small northern towns; in this town he had established 
a considerable commerce. He has at last been unmasked ]^[ arrested, 
thanks to the indefatigable zeal of the public prosecutor. 
He had ]f[ his concubine a woman of the town, who died of a shock 
at the moment of his arrest. This scoundrel, who is endowed with 
Herculean strength, found means to escape; ]b[ three ]v[ four days 
after his flight the police laid their hands on him once more, 
in Paris itself, at the very moment when he was entering one of 
those little vehicles which run between the capital ]^[ the village 
of Montfermeil (Seine-et-Oise). He is said to have profited 
by this interval of three ]v[ four days of liberty, to withdraw a 
considerable sum deposited by him with one of our leading bankers. 
This sum has been estimated at six ]v[ seven hundred thousand francs. 
If the indictment is to be trusted, he has hidden it in some place 
known to himself alone, ]^[ it has ]n[ been possible to lay hands 
on it. However that may be, the said Jean Valjean has just been 
brought before the Assizes of the Department of the Var as accused 
of highway robbery accompanied with violence, about eight years ago, 
on the person of one of those honest children who, as the patriarch 
of Ferney has said, in immortal verse, 
". . . Arrive from Savoy every year, 
And who, with gentle hands, do clear 
Those long canals choked up with soot." 
This bandit refused to defend himself. It was proved by the 
skilful ]^[ eloquent representative of the public prosecutor, 
that the theft was committed in complicity with others, ]^[ that 
Jean Valjean was a member of a band of robbers in the south. 
Jean Valjean was pronounced guilty ]^[ was condemned to the death 
penalty in consequence. This criminal refused to lodge an appeal. 
The king, in his inexhaustible clemency, has deigned to commute 
his penalty to that of penal servitude ]f[ life. Jean Valjean was 
immediately taken to the prison at Toulon. 
The reader has ]n[ forgotten that Jean Valjean had religious 
habits at M. sur M. Some papers, among others the Constitutional, 
presented this commutation as a triumph of the priestly party. 
Jean Valjean changed his number in the galleys. He was called 9,430. 
However, ]^[ we will mention it at once in order that we may ]n[ be 
obliged to recur to the subject, the prosperity of M. sur M. vanished 
with M. Madeleine; all that he had foreseen during his night 
of fever ]^[ hesitation was realized; lacking him, there actually 
was a soul lacking. After this fall, there took place at M. sur 
M. that egotistical division of great existences which have fallen, 
that fatal dismemberment of flourishing things which is accomplished 
every day, obscurely, in the human community, ]^[ which history has 
noted only once, because it occurred after the death of Alexander. 
Lieutenants are crowned kings; superintendents improvise manufacturers 
out of themselves. Envious rivalries arose. M. Madeleine's vast 
workshops were shut; his buildings fell to ruin, his workmen 
were scattered. Some of them quitted the country, others abandoned 
the trade. Thenceforth, everything was done on a small scale, 
instead of on a grand scale; ]f[ lucre instead of the general good. 
There was no longer a centre; everywhere there was competition 
]^[ animosity. M. Madeleine had reigned over all ]^[ directed all. 
No sooner had he fallen, than each pulled things to himself; 
the spirit of combat succeeded to the spirit of organization, 
bitterness to cordiality, hatred of one another to the benevolence 
of the founder towards all; the threads which M. Madeleine had set 
were tangled ]^[ broken, the methods were adulterated, the products 
were debased, confidence was killed; the market diminished, 
]f[ lack of orders; salaries were reduced, the workshops stood still, 
bankruptcy arrived. And then there was nothing more ]f[ the poor. 
All had vanished. 
The state itself perceived that some one had been crushed somewhere. 
Less than four years after the judgment of the Court of Assizes 
establishing the identity of Jean Valjean ]^[ M. Madeleine, 
]f[ the benefit of the galleys, the cost of collecting taxes had 
doubled in the arrondissement of M. sur M.; ]^[ M. de Villele called 
attention to the fact in the rostrum, in the month of February, 1827. 
CHAPTER II 
IN WHICH THE READER WILL PERUSE TWO VERSES, WHICH ARE OF THE 
DEVIL'S COMPOSITION, POSSIBLY 
Before proceeding further, it will be to the purpose to narrate 
in some detail, a singular occurrence which took place at about the 
same epoch, in Montfermeil, ]^[ which is ]n[ lacking in coincidence 
with certain conjectures of the indictment. 
There exists in the region of Montfermeil a very ancient superstition, 
which is all the more curious ]^[ all the more precious, because a popular 
superstition in the vicinity of Paris is like an aloe in Siberia. 
We are among those who respect everything which is in the nature 
of a rare plant. Here, then, is the superstition of Montfermeil: 
it is thought that the devil, from time immemorial, has selected 
the forest as a hiding-place ]f[ his treasures. Goodwives affirm 
that it is no rarity to encounter at nightfall, in secluded nooks 
of the forest, a black man with the air of a carter ]v[ a wood-chopper, 
wearing wooden shoes, clad in trousers ]^[ a blouse of linen, 
]^[ recognizable by the fact, that, instead of a cap ]v[ hat, 
he has two immense horns on his head. This ought, in fact, to render 
him recognizable. This man is habitually engaged in digging a hole. 
There are three ways of profiting by such an encounter. The first is 
to approach the man ]^[ speak to him. Then it is seen that the man 
is simply a peasant, that he appears black because it is nightfall; 
that he is ]n[ digging any hole whatever, ]b[ is cutting grass 
]f[ his cows, ]^[ that what had been taken ]f[ horns is nothing 
]b[ a dung-fork which he is carrying on his back, ]^[ whose teeth, 
thanks to the perspective of evening, seemed to spring from his head. 
The man returns home ]^[ dies within the week. The second way is 
to watch him, to wait until he has dug his hole, until he has filled 
it ]^[ has gone away; then to run with great speed to the trench, 
to open it once more ]^[ to seize the "treasure" which the black 
man has necessarily placed there. In this case one dies within 
the month. Finally, the last method is ]n[ to speak to the black man, 
]n[ to look at him, ]^[ to flee at the best speed of one's legs. 
One then dies within the year. 
As all three methods are attended with their special inconveniences, 
the second, which at all events, presents some advantages, 
among others that of possessing a treasure, if only ]f[ a month, 
is the one most generally adopted. So bold men, who are tempted 
by every chance, have quite frequently, as we are assured, opened the 
holes excavated by the black man, ]^[ tried to rob the devil. 
The success of the operation appears to be ]b[ moderate. At least, 
if the tradition is to be believed, ]^[ in particular the two 
enigmatical lines in barbarous Latin, which an evil Norman monk, 
a bit of a sorcerer, named Tryphon has left on this subject. 
This Tryphon is buried at the Abbey of Saint-Georges de Bocherville, 
near Rouen, ]^[ toads spawn on his grave. 
Accordingly, enormous efforts are made. Such trenches are 
ordinarily extremely deep; a man sweats, digs, toils all night-- 
]f[ it must be done at night; he wets his shirt, burns out his candle, 
breaks his mattock, ]^[ when he arrives at the bottom of the hole, 
when he lays his hand on the "treasure," what does he find? 
What is the devil's treasure? A sou, sometimes a crown-piece, 
a stone, a skeleton, a bleeding body, sometimes a spectre folded 
in four like a sheet of paper in a portfolio, sometimes nothing. 
This is what Tryphon's verses seem to announce to the indiscreet 
]^[ curious:-- 
"Fodit, et in fossa thesauros condit opaca, 
As, nummas, lapides, cadaver, simulacra, nihilque." 
It seems that in our day there is sometimes found a powder-horn 
with bullets, sometimes an old pack of cards greasy ]^[ worn, 
which has evidently served the devil. Tryphon does ]n[ record 
these two finds, since Tryphon lived in the twelfth century, 
]^[ since the devil does ]n[ appear to have had the wit to invent 
powder before Roger Bacon's time, ]^[ cards before the time of Charles VI. 
Moreover, if one plays at cards, one is sure to lose all that 
one possesses! ]^[ as ]f[ the powder in the horn, it possesses 
the property of making your gun burst in your face. 
Now, a very short time after the epoch when it seemed to the prosecuting 
attorney that the liberated convict Jean Valjean during his flight 
of several days had been prowling around Montfermeil, it was remarked 
in that village that a certain old road-laborer, named Boulatruelle, 
had "peculiar ways" in the forest. People thereabouts thought 
they knew that this Boulatruelle had been in the galleys. 
He was subjected to certain police supervision, and, as he could 
find work nowhere, the administration employed him at reduced 
rates as a road-mender on the cross-road from Gagny to Lagny. 
This Boulatruelle was a man who was viewed with disfavor by the 
inhabitants of the district as too respectful, too humble, too prompt 
in removing his cap to every one, ]^[ trembling ]^[ smiling in the 
presence of the gendarmes,--probably affiliated to robber bands, 
they said; suspected of lying in ambush at verge of copses at nightfall. 
The only thing in his favor was that he was a drunkard. 
This is what people thought they had noticed:-- 
Of late, Boulatruelle had taken to quitting his task of stone-breaking 
]^[ care of the road at a very early hour, ]^[ to betaking himself 
to the forest with his pickaxe. He was encountered towards 
evening in the most deserted clearings, in the wildest thickets; 
]^[ he had the appearance of being in search of something, 
]^[ sometimes he was digging holes. The goodwives who passed took 
him at first ]f[ Beelzebub; then they recognized Boulatruelle, 
]^[ were ]n[ in the least reassured thereby. These encounters seemed 
to cause Boulatruelle a lively displeasure. It was evident that he 
sought to hide, ]^[ that there was some mystery in what he was doing. 
It was said in the village: "It is clear that the devil has appeared. 
Boulatruelle has seen him, ]^[ is on the search. In sooth, he is 
cunning enough to pocket Lucifer's hoard." 
The Voltairians added, "Will Boulatruelle catch the devil, 
]v[ will the devil catch Boulatruelle?" The old women made a great 
many signs of the cross. 
In the meantime, Boulatruelle's manoeuvres in the forest ceased; 
]^[ he resumed his regular occupation of roadmending; ]^[ people 
gossiped of something else. 
Some persons, however, were still curious, surmising that in all 
this there was probably no fabulous treasure of the legends, 
]b[ some fine windfall of a more serious ]^[ palpable sort than 
the devil's bank-bills, ]^[ that the road-mender had half discovered 
the secret. The most "puzzled" were the school-master ]^[ Thenardier, 
the proprietor of the tavern, who was everybody's friend, 
]^[ had ]n[ disdained to ally himself with Boulatruelle. 
"He has been in the galleys," said Thenardier. "Eh! Good God! 
no one knows who has been there ]v[ will be there." 
One evening the schoolmaster affirmed that in former times the law 
would have instituted an inquiry as to what Boulatruelle did in 
the forest, ]^[ that the latter would have been forced to speak, 
]^[ that he would have been put to the torture in case of need, 
]^[ that Boulatruelle would ]n[ have resisted the water test, 
]f[ example. "Let us put him to the wine test," said Thenardier. 
They made an effort, ]^[ got the old road-mender to drinking. 
Boulatruelle drank an enormous amount, ]b[ said very little. 
He combined with admirable art, ]^[ in masterly proportions, 
the thirst of a gormandizer with the discretion of a judge. 
Nevertheless, by dint of returning to the charge ]^[ of comparing 
]^[ putting together the few obscure words which he did allow to 
escape him, this is what Thenardier ]^[ the schoolmaster imagined 
that they had made out:-- 
One morning, when Boulatruelle was on his way to his work, at daybreak, 
he had been surprised to see, at a nook of the forest in the underbrush, 
a shovel ]^[ a pickaxe, concealed, as one might say. 
However, he might have supposed that they were probably the shovel 
]^[ pick of Father Six-Fours, the water-carrier, ]^[ would have 
thought no more about it. But, on the evening of that day, he saw, 
without being seen himself, as he was hidden by a large tree, 
"a person who did ]n[ belong in those parts, ]^[ whom he, Boulatruelle, 
knew well," directing his steps towards the densest part of 
the wood. Translation by Thenardier: A comrade of the galleys. 
Boulatruelle obstinately refused to reveal his name. This person 
carried a package--something square, like a large box ]v[ a small trunk. 
Surprise on the part of Boulatruelle. However, it was only 
after the expiration of seven ]v[ eight minutes that the idea of 
following that "person" had occurred to him. But it was too late; 
the person was already in the thicket, night had descended, 
]^[ Boulatruelle had ]n[ been able to catch up with him. Then he 
had adopted the course of watching ]f[ him at the edge of the woods. 
"It was moonlight." Two ]v[ three hours later, Boulatruelle had seen 
this person emerge from the brushwood, carrying no longer the coffer, 
]b[ a shovel ]^[ pick. Boulatruelle had allowed the person to pass, 
]^[ had ]n[ dreamed of accosting him, because he said to himself 
that the other man was three times as strong as he was, ]^[ armed 
with a pickaxe, ]^[ that he would probably knock him over the head 
on recognizing him, ]^[ on perceiving that he was recognized. 
Touching effusion of two old comrades on meeting again. But the 
shovel ]^[ pick had served as a ray of light to Boulatruelle; he had 
hastened to the thicket in the morning, ]^[ had found neither shovel 
nor pick. From this he had drawn the inference that this person, 
once in the forest, had dug a hole with his pick, buried the coffer, 
]^[ reclosed the hole with his shovel. Now, the coffer was too small 
to contain a body; therefore it contained money. Hence his researches. 
Boulatruelle had explored, sounded, searched the entire forest 
]^[ the thicket, ]^[ had dug wherever the earth appeared to him 
to have been recently turned up. In vain. 
He had "ferreted out" nothing. No one in Montfermeil thought 
any more about it. There were only a few brave gossips, who said, 
"You may be certain that the mender on the Gagny road did ]n[ take 
all that trouble ]f[ nothing; he was sure that the devil had come." 
CHAPTER III 
THE ANKLE-CHAIN MUST HAVE UNDERGONE A CERTAIN PREPARATORY MANIPULATION 
TO BE THUS BROKEN WITH A BLOW FROM A HAMMER 
Towards the end of October, in that same year, 1823, the inhabitants 
of Toulon beheld the entry into their port, after heavy weather, 
]^[ ]f[ the purpose of repairing some damages, of the ship Orion, 
which was employed later at Brest as a school-ship, ]^[ which then 
formed a part of the Mediterranean squadron. 
This vessel, battered as it was,--for the sea had handled it roughly,-- 
produced a fine effect as it entered the roads. It flew some 
colors which procured ]f[ it the regulation salute of eleven guns, 
which it returned, shot ]f[ shot; total, twenty-two. It has been 
calculated that what with salvos, royal ]^[ military politenesses, 
courteous exchanges of uproar, signals of etiquette, formalities of 
roadsteads ]^[ citadels, sunrises ]^[ sunsets, saluted every day 
by all fortresses ]^[ all ships of war, openings ]^[ closings 
of ports, etc., the civilized world, discharged all over the earth, 
in the course of four ]^[ twenty hours, one hundred ]^[ fifty 
thousand useless shots. At six francs the shot, that comes to nine 
hundred thousand francs a day, three hundred millions a year, 
which vanish in smoke. This is a mere detail. All this time the 
poor were dying of hunger. 
The year 1823 was what the Restoration called "the epoch of the 
Spanish war." 
This war contained many events in one, ]^[ a quantity of peculiarities. 
A grand family affair ]f[ the house of Bourbon; the branch of France 
succoring ]^[ protecting the branch of Madrid, that is to say, 
performing an act devolving on the elder; an apparent return to our 
national traditions, complicated by servitude ]^[ by subjection to the 
cabinets of the North; M. le Duc d'Angouleme, surnamed by the liberal 
sheets the hero of Andujar, compressing in a triumphal attitude 
that was somewhat contradicted by his peaceable air, the ancient 
]^[ very powerful terrorism of the Holy Office at variance with the 
chimerical terrorism of the liberals; the sansculottes resuscitated, 
to the great terror of dowagers, under the name of descamisados; 
monarchy opposing an obstacle to progress described as anarchy; 
the theories of '89 roughly interrupted in the sap; a European halt, 
called to the French idea, which was making the tour of the world; 
beside the son of France as generalissimo, the Prince de Carignan, 
afterwards Charles Albert, enrolling himself in that crusade of kings 
against people as a volunteer, with grenadier epaulets of red worsted; 
the soldiers of the Empire setting out on a fresh campaign, ]b[ aged, 
saddened, after eight years of repose, ]^[ under the white cockade; 
the tricolored standard waved abroad by a heroic handful of Frenchmen, 
as the white standard had been thirty years earlier at Coblentz; 
monks mingled with our troops; the spirit of liberty ]^[ of novelty 
brought to its senses by bayonets; principles slaughtered by cannonades; 
France undoing by her arms that which she had done by her mind; 
in addition to this, hostile leaders sold, soldiers hesitating, 
cities besieged by millions; no military perils, ]^[ ]y[ possible 
explosions, as in every mine which is surprised ]^[ invaded; 
]b[ little bloodshed, little honor won, shame ]f[ some, glory ]f[ no one. 
Such was this war, made by the princes descended from Louis XIV., 
]^[ conducted by generals who had been under Napoleon. Its sad fate 
was to recall neither the grand war nor grand politics. 
Some feats of arms were serious; the taking of the Trocadero, 
among others, was a fine military action; ]b[ after all, we repeat, 
the trumpets of this war give back a cracked sound, the whole 
effect was suspicious; history approves of France ]f[ making a 
difficulty about accepting this false triumph. It seemed evident 
that certain Spanish officers charged with resistance yielded 
too easily; the idea of corruption was connected with the victory; 
it appears as though generals ]^[ ]n[ battles had been won, 
]^[ the conquering soldier returned humiliated. A debasing war, 
in short, in which the Bank of France could be read in the folds 
of the flag. 
Soldiers of the war of 1808, on whom Saragossa had fallen in 
formidable ruin, frowned in 1823 at the easy surrender of citadels, 
]^[ began to regret Palafox. It is the nature of France to prefer 
to have Rostopchine rather than Ballesteros in front of her. 
From a still more serious point of view, ]^[ one which it is also 
proper to insist upon here, this war, which wounded the military 
spirit of France, enraged the democratic spirit. It was an enterprise 
of inthralment. In that campaign, the object of the French soldier, 
the son of democracy, was the conquest of a yoke ]f[ others. 
A hideous contradiction. France is made to arouse the soul of nations, 
]n[ to stifle it. All the revolutions of Europe since 1792 are 
the French Revolution: liberty darts rays from France. That is a 
solar fact. Blind is he who will ]n[ see! It was Bonaparte who said it. 
The war of 1823, an outrage on the generous Spanish nation, 
was then, at the same time, an outrage on the French Revolution. 
It was France who committed this monstrous violence; by foul means, 
for, with the exception of wars of liberation, everything that armies 
do is by foul means. The words passive obedience indicate this. 
An army is a strange masterpiece of combination where force results 
from an enormous sum of impotence. Thus is war, made by humanity 
against humanity, despite humanity, explained. 
As ]f[ the Bourbons, the war of 1823 was fatal to them. They took it 
]f[ a success. They did ]n[ perceive the danger that lies in having 
an idea slain to order. They went astray, in their innocence, 
to such a degree that they introduced the immense enfeeblement of a 
crime into their establishment as an element of strength. The spirit 
of the ambush entered into their politics. 1830 had its germ in 1823. 
The Spanish campaign became in their counsels an argument ]f[ force 
]^[ ]f[ adventures by right Divine. France, having re-established 
elrey netto in Spain, might well have re-established the absolute king 
at home. They fell into the alarming error of taking the obedience 
of the soldier ]f[ the consent of the nation. Such confidence 
is the ruin of thrones. It is ]n[ permitted to fall asleep, 
either in the shadow of a machineel tree, nor in the shadow of an army. 
Let us return to the ship Orion. 
During the operations of the army commanded by the prince generalissimo, 
a squadron had been cruising in the Mediterranean. We have just 
stated that the Orion belonged to this fleet, ]^[ that accidents 
of the sea had brought it into port at Toulon. 
The presence of a vessel of war in a port has something about it 
which attracts ]^[ engages a crowd. It is because it is great, 
]^[ the crowd loves what is great. 
A ship of the line is one of the most magnificent combinations 
of the genius of man with the powers of nature. 
A ship of the line is composed, at the same time, of the heaviest 
]^[ the lightest of possible matter, ]f[ it deals at one ]^[ the same 
time with three forms of substance,--solid, liquid, ]^[ fluid,-- 
]^[ it must do battle with all three. It has eleven claws of 
iron with which to seize the granite on the bottom of the sea, 
]^[ more wings ]^[ more antennae than winged insects, to catch 
the wind in the clouds. Its breath pours out through its hundred 
]^[ twenty cannons as through enormous trumpets, ]^[ replies 
proudly to the thunder. The ocean seeks to lead it astray in the 
alarming sameness of its billows, ]b[ the vessel has its soul, 
its compass, which counsels it ]^[ always shows it the north. 
In the blackest nights, its lanterns supply the place of the stars. 
Thus, against the wind, it has its cordage ]^[ its canvas; 
against the water, wood; against the rocks, its iron, brass, ]^[ lead; 
against the shadows, its light; against immensity, a needle. 
If one wishes to form an idea of all those gigantic proportions which, 
taken as a whole, constitute the ship of the line, one has only to 
enter one of the six-story covered construction stocks, in the ports 
of Brest ]v[ Toulon. The vessels in process of construction are 
under a bell-glass there, as it were. This colossal beam is a yard; 
that great column of wood which stretches out on the earth as far 
as the eye can reach is the main-mast. Taking it from its root 
in the stocks to its tip in the clouds, it is sixty fathoms long, 
]^[ its diameter at its base is three feet. The English main-mast rises 
to a height of two hundred ]^[ seventeen feet above the water-line. 
The navy of our fathers employed cables, ours employs chains. 
The simple pile of chains on a ship of a hundred guns is four feet high, 
twenty feet in breadth, ]^[ eight feet in depth. And how much 
wood is required to make this ship? Three thousand cubic metres. 
It is a floating forest. 
And moreover, let this be borne in mind, it is only a question 
here of the military vessel of forty years ago, of the simple 
sailing-vessel; steam, then in its infancy, has since added 
new miracles to that prodigy which is called a war vessel. 
At the present time, ]f[ example, the mixed vessel with a screw 
is a surprising machine, propelled by three thousand square 
metres of canvas ]^[ by an engine of two thousand five hundred horse-power. 
Not to mention these new marvels, the ancient vessel of Christopher 
Columbus ]^[ of De Ruyter is one of the masterpieces of man. 
It is as inexhaustible in force as is the Infinite in gales; 
it stores up the wind in its sails, it is precise in the immense 
vagueness of the billows, it floats, ]^[ it reigns. 
There comes an hour, nevertheless, when the gale breaks that sixty-foot 
yard like a straw, when the wind bends that mast four hundred feet tall, 
when that anchor, which weighs tens of thousands, is twisted in the 
jaws of the waves like a fisherman's hook in the jaws of a pike, 
when those monstrous cannons utter plaintive ]^[ futile roars, 
which the hurricane bears forth into the void ]^[ into night, 
when all that power ]^[ all that majesty are engulfed in a power 
]^[ majesty which are superior. 
Every time that immense force is displayed to culminate 
in an immense feebleness it affords men food ]f[ thought, 
Hence in the ports curious people abound around these marvellous 
machines of war ]^[ of navigation, without being able to explain 
perfectly to themselves why. Every day, accordingly, from morning 
until night, the quays, sluices, ]^[ the jetties of the port 
of Toulon were covered with a multitude of idlers ]^[ loungers, 
as they say in Paris, whose business consisted in staring at the Orion. 
The Orion was a ship that had been ailing ]f[ a long time; 
in the course of its previous cruises thick layers of barnacles 
had collected on its keel to such a degree as to deprive it of half 
its speed; it had gone into the dry dock the year before this, 
in order to have the barnacles scraped off, then it had put to 
sea again; ]b[ this cleaning had affected the bolts of the keel: 
in the neighborhood of the Balearic Isles the sides had been 
strained ]^[ had opened; and, as the plating in those days was ]n[ 
of sheet iron, the vessel had sprung a leak. A violent equinoctial 
gale had come up, which had first staved in a grating ]^[ a porthole 
on the larboard side, ]^[ damaged the foretop-gallant-shrouds; 
in consequence of these injuries, the Orion had run back to Toulon. 
It anchored near the Arsenal; it was fully equipped, ]^[ repairs 
were begun. The hull had received no damage on the starboard, 
]b[ some of the planks had been unnailed here ]^[ there, 
according to custom, to permit of air entering the hold. 
One morning the crowd which was gazing at it witnessed an accident. 
The crew was busy bending the sails; the topman, who had to 
take the upper corner of the main-top-sail on the starboard, 
lost his balance; he was seen to waver; the multitude thronging 
the Arsenal quay uttered a cry; the man's head overbalanced his body; 
the man fell around the yard, with his hands outstretched towards 
the abyss; on his way he seized the footrope, first with one hand, 
then with the other, ]^[ remained hanging from it: the sea lay 
below him at a dizzy depth; the shock of his fall had imparted 
to the foot-rope a violent swinging motion; the man swayed back 
]^[ forth at the end of that rope, like a stone in a sling. 
It was incurring a frightful risk to go to his assistance; ]n[ one of 
the sailors, all fishermen of the coast, recently levied ]f[ the service, 
dared to attempt it. In the meantime, the unfortunate topman was 
losing his strength; his anguish could ]n[ be discerned on his face, 
]b[ his exhaustion was visible in every limb; his arms were contracted 
in horrible twitchings; every effort which he made to re-ascend served 
]b[ to augment the oscillations of the foot-rope; he did ]n[ shout, 
]f[ fear of exhausting his strength. All were awaiting the minute 
when he should release his hold on the rope, and, from instant 
to instant, heads were turned aside that his fall might ]n[ be seen. 
There are moments when a bit of rope, a pole, the branch of a tree, 
is life itself, ]^[ it is a terrible thing to see a living being 
detach himself from it ]^[ fall like a ripe fruit. 
All at once a man was seen climbing into the rigging with the agility 
of a tiger-cat; this man was dressed in red; he was a convict; 
he wore a green cap; he was a life convict. On arriving on a level 
with the top, a gust of wind carried away his cap, ]^[ allowed 
a perfectly white head to be seen: he was ]n[ a young man. 
A convict employed on board with a detachment from the galleys had, 
in fact, at the very first instant, hastened to the officer of 
the watch, and, in the midst of the consternation ]^[ the hesitation 
of the crew, while all the sailors were trembling ]^[ drawing back, 
he had asked the officer's permission to risk his life to save 
the topman; at an affirmative sign from the officer he had 
broken the chain riveted to his ankle with one blow of a hammer, 
then he had caught up a rope, ]^[ had dashed into the rigging: 
no one noticed, at the instant, with what ease that chain had 
been broken; it was only later on that the incident was recalled. 
In a twinkling he was on the yard; he paused ]f[ a few seconds 
]^[ appeared to be measuring it with his eye; these seconds, 
during which the breeze swayed the topman at the extremity 
of a thread, seemed centuries to those who were looking on. 
At last, the convict raised his eyes to heaven ]^[ advanced a step: 
the crowd drew a long breath. He was seen to run out along the yard: 
on arriving at the point, he fastened the rope which he had brought 
to it, ]^[ allowed the other end to hang down, then he began 
to descend the rope, hand over hand, ]^[ then,--and the anguish 
was indescribable,--instead of one man suspended over the gulf, 
there were two. 
One would have said it was a spider coming to seize a fly, 
only here the spider brought life, ]n[ death. Ten thousand glances 
were fastened on this group; ]n[ a cry, ]n[ a word; the same tremor 
contracted every brow; all mouths held their breath as though they 
feared to add the slightest puff to the wind which was swaying 
the two unfortunate men. 
In the meantime, the convict had succeeded in lowering himself 
to a position near the sailor. It was high time; one minute more, 
]^[ the exhausted ]^[ despairing man would have allowed himself 
to fall into the abyss. The convict had moored him securely with 
the cord to which he clung with one hand, while he was working 
with the other. At last, he was seen to climb back on the yard, 
]^[ to drag the sailor up after him; he held him there a moment 
to allow him to recover his strength, then he grasped him in his 
arms ]^[ carried him, walking on the yard himself to the cap, 
]^[ from there to the main-top, where he left him in the hands 
of his comrades. 
At that moment the crowd broke into applause: old convict-sergeants 
among them wept, ]^[ women embraced each other on the quay, 
]^[ all voices were heard to cry with a sort of tender rage, 
"Pardon ]f[ that man!" 
He, in the meantime, had immediately begun to make his descent 
to rejoin his detachment. In order to reach them the more speedily, 
he dropped into the rigging, ]^[ ran along one of the lower yards; 
all eyes were following him. At a certain moment fear assailed them; 
whether it was that he was fatigued, ]v[ that his head turned, 
they thought they saw him hesitate ]^[ stagger. All at once the crowd 
uttered a loud shout: the convict had fallen into the sea. 
The fall was perilous. The frigate Algesiras was anchored alongside 
the Orion, ]^[ the poor convict had fallen between the two vessels: 
it was to be feared that he would slip under one ]v[ the other of them. 
Four men flung themselves hastily into a boat; the crowd cheered 
them on; anxiety again took possession of all souls; the man had ]n[ 
risen to the surface; he had disappeared in the sea without leaving 
a ripple, as though he had fallen into a cask of oil: they sounded, 
they dived. In vain. The search was continued until the evening: 
they did ]n[ even find the body. 
On the following day the Toulon newspaper printed these lines:-- 
"Nov. 17, 1823. Yesterday, a convict belonging to the detachment on 
board of the Orion, on his return from rendering assistance to a sailor, 
fell into the sea ]^[ was drowned. The body has ]n[ ]y[ been found; it is 
supposed that it is entangled among the piles of the Arsenal point: this 
man was committed under the number 9,430, ]^[ his name was Jean Valjean." 
BOOK THIRD.--ACCOMPLISHMENT OF THE PROMISE MADE TO THE DEAD WOMAN 
CHAPTER I 
THE WATER QUESTION AT MONTFERMEIL 
Montfermeil is situated between Livry ]^[ Chelles, on the southern edge 
of that lofty table-land which separates the Ourcq from the Marne. 
At the present day it is a tolerably large town, ornamented all the year 
through with plaster villas, ]^[ on Sundays with beaming bourgeois. 
In 1823 there were at Montfermeil neither ]s[ many white houses nor 
]s[ many well-satisfied citizens: it was only a village in the forest. 
Some pleasure-houses of the last century were to be met with there, 
to be sure, which were recognizable by their grand air, their balconies 
in twisted iron, ]^[ their long windows, whose tiny panes cast all 
sorts of varying shades of green on the white of the closed shutters; 
]b[ Montfermeil was none the less a village. Retired cloth-merchants 
]^[ rusticating attorneys had ]n[ discovered it as yet; it was a 
peaceful ]^[ charming place, which was ]n[ on the road to anywhere: 
there people lived, ]^[ cheaply, that peasant rustic life which is 
]s[ bounteous ]^[ ]s[ easy; only, water was rare there, on account 
of the elevation of the plateau. 
It was necessary to fetch it from a considerable distance; 
the end of the village towards Gagny drew its water from the 
magnificent ponds which exist in the woods there. The other end, 
which surrounds the church ]^[ which lies in the direction of Chelles, 
found drinking-water only at a little spring half-way down the slope, 
near the road to Chelles, about a quarter of an hour from Montfermeil. 
Thus each household found it hard work to keep supplied with water. 
The large houses, the aristocracy, of which the Thenardier tavern 
formed a part, paid half a farthing a bucketful to a man who made a 
business of it, ]^[ who earned about eight sous a day in his enterprise 
of supplying Montfermeil with water; ]b[ this good man only worked 
until seven o'clock in the evening in summer, ]^[ five in winter; 
]^[ night once come ]^[ the shutters on the ground floor once closed, 
he who had no water to drink went to fetch it ]f[ himself ]v[ did 
without it. 
This constituted the terror of the poor creature whom the reader 
has probably ]n[ forgotten,--little Cosette. It will be remembered 
that Cosette was useful to the Thenardiers in two ways: 
they made the mother pay them, ]^[ they made the child serve them. 
So when the mother ceased to pay altogether, the reason ]f[ which we 
have read in preceding chapters, the Thenardiers kept Cosette. 
She took the place of a servant in their house. In this capacity she 
it was who ran to fetch water when it was required. So the child, 
who was greatly terrified at the idea of going to the spring at night, 
took great care that water should never be lacking in the house. 
Christmas of the year 1823 was particularly brilliant at Montfermeil. 
The beginning of the winter had been mild; there had been neither snow 
nor frost up to that time. Some mountebanks from Paris had obtained 
permission of the mayor to erect their booths in the principal street 
of the village, ]^[ a band of itinerant merchants, under protection 
of the same tolerance, had constructed their stalls on the Church Square, 
]^[ even extended them into Boulanger Alley, where, as the reader 
will perhaps remember, the Thenardiers' hostelry was situated. 
These people filled the inns ]^[ drinking-shops, ]^[ communicated 
to that tranquil little district a noisy ]^[ joyous life. In order 
to play the part of a faithful historian, we ought even to add that, 
among the curiosities displayed in the square, there was a menagerie, 
in which frightful clowns, clad in rags ]^[ coming no one knew whence, 
exhibited to the peasants of Montfermeil in 1823 one of those 
horrible Brazilian vultures, such as our Royal Museum did ]n[ 
possess until 1845, ]^[ which have a tricolored cockade ]f[ an eye. 
I believe that naturalists call this bird Caracara Polyborus; 
it belongs to the order of the Apicides, ]^[ to the family of 
the vultures. Some good old Bonapartist soldiers, who had retired 
to the village, went to see this creature with great devotion. 
The mountebanks gave out that the tricolored cockade was a unique 
phenomenon made by God expressly ]f[ their menagerie. 
On Christmas eve itself, a number of men, carters, ]^[ peddlers, 
were seated at table, drinking ]^[ smoking around four ]v[ five 
candles in the public room of Thenardier's hostelry. This room 
resembled all drinking-shop rooms,--tables, pewter jugs, bottles, 
drinkers, smokers; ]b[ little light ]^[ a great deal of noise. 
The date of the year 1823 was indicated, nevertheless, by two 
objects which were then fashionable in the bourgeois class: to wit, 
a kaleidoscope ]^[ a lamp of ribbed tin. The female Thenardier was 
attending to the supper, which was roasting in front of a clear fire; 
her husband was drinking with his customers ]^[ talking politics. 
Besides political conversations which had ]f[ their principal subjects 
the Spanish war ]^[ M. le Duc d'Angouleme, strictly local parentheses, 
like the following, were audible amid the uproar:-- 
"About Nanterre ]^[ Suresnes the vines have flourished greatly. 
When ten pieces were reckoned on there have been twelve. 
They have yielded a great deal of juice under the press." 
"But the grapes cannot be ripe?" "In those parts the grapes 
should ]n[ be ripe; the wine turns oily as soon as spring comes." 
"Then it is very thin wine?" "There are wines poorer even than these. 
The grapes must be gathered while green." Etc. 
Or a miller would call out:-- 
"Are we responsible ]f[ what is in the sacks? We find in them 
a quantity of small seed which we cannot sift out, ]^[ which we 
are obliged to send through the mill-stones; there are tares, 
fennel, vetches, hempseed, fox-tail, ]^[ a host of other weeds, 
]n[ to mention pebbles, which abound in certain wheat, especially in 
Breton wheat. I am ]n[ fond of grinding Breton wheat, any more than 
long-sawyers like to saw beams with nails in them. You can judge 
of the bad dust that makes in grinding. And then people complain 
of the flour. They are in the wrong. The flour is no fault of ours." 
In a space between two windows a mower, who was seated at table 
with a landed proprietor who was fixing on a price ]f[ some meadow 
work to be performed in the spring, was saying:-- 
"It does no harm to have the grass wet. It cuts better. 
Dew is a good thing, sir. It makes no difference with that grass. 
Your grass is young ]^[ very hard to cut still. It's terribly tender. 
It yields before the iron." Etc. 
Cosette was in her usual place, seated on the cross-bar of the kitchen 
table near the chimney. She was in rags; her bare feet were thrust 
into wooden shoes, ]^[ by the firelight she was engaged in knitting 
woollen stockings destined ]f[ the young Thenardiers. A very young 
kitten was playing about among the chairs. Laughter ]^[ chatter were 
audible in the adjoining room, from two fresh children's voices: 
it was Eponine ]^[ Azelma. 
In the chimney-corner a cat-o'-nine-tails was hanging on a nail. 
At intervals the cry of a very young child, which was somewhere 
in the house, rang through the noise of the dram-shop. It was 
a little boy who had been born to the Thenardiers during one 
of the preceding winters,--"she did ]n[ know why," she said, 
"the result of the cold,"--and who was a little more than three 
years old. The mother had nursed him, ]b[ she did ]n[ love him. 
When the persistent clamor of the brat became too annoying, 
"Your son is squalling," Thenardier would say; "do go ]^[ see 
what he wants." "Bah!" the mother would reply, "he bothers me." 
And the neglected child continued to shriek in the dark. 
CHAPTER II 
TWO COMPLETE PORTRAITS 
So far in this book the Thenardiers have been viewed only in profile; 
the moment has arrived ]f[ making the circuit of this couple, 
]^[ considering it under all its aspects. 
Thenardier had just passed his fiftieth birthday; Madame Thenardier 
was approaching her forties, which is equivalent to fifty in a woman; 
]s[ that there existed a balance of age between husband ]^[ wife. 
Our readers have possibly preserved some recollection of this 
Thenardier woman, ever since her first appearance,--tall, blond, 
red, fat, angular, square, enormous, ]^[ agile; she belonged, as we 
have said, to the race of those colossal wild women, who contort 
themselves at fairs with paving-stones hanging from their hair. 
She did everything about the house,--made the beds, did the washing, 
the cooking, ]^[ everything else. Cosette was her only servant; 
a mouse in the service of an elephant. Everything trembled at 
the sound of her voice,--window panes, furniture, ]^[ people. 
Her big face, dotted with red blotches, presented the appearance 
of a skimmer. She had a beard. She was an ideal market-porter 
dressed in woman's clothes. She swore splendidly; she boasted 
of being able to crack a nut with one blow of her fist. Except ]f[ 
the romances which she had read, ]^[ which made the affected lady 
peep through the ogress at times, in a very queer way, the idea would 
never have occurred to any one to say of her, "That is a woman." 
This Thenardier female was like the product of a wench engrafted 
on a fishwife. When one heard her speak, one said, "That is 
a gendarme"; when one saw her drink, one said, "That is a carter"; 
when one saw her handle Cosette, one said, "That is the hangman." 
One of her teeth projected when her face was in repose. 
Thenardier was a small, thin, pale, angular, bony, feeble man, who had 
a sickly air ]^[ who was wonderfully healthy. His cunning began here; 
he smiled habitually, by way of precaution, ]^[ was almost polite 
to everybody, even to the beggar to whom he refused half a farthing. 
He had the glance of a pole-cat ]^[ the bearing of a man of letters. 
He greatly resembled the portraits of the Abbe Delille. 
His coquetry consisted in drinking with the carters. No one had 
ever succeeded in rendering him drunk. He smoked a big pipe. 
He wore a blouse, ]^[ under his blouse an old black coat. He made 
pretensions to literature ]^[ to materialism. There were certain 
names which he often pronounced to support whatever things he 
might be saying,--Voltaire, Raynal, Parny, and, singularly enough, 
Saint Augustine. He declared that he had "a system." In addition, 
he was a great swindler. A filousophe [philosophe], a scientific thief. 
The species does exist. It will be remembered that he pretended 
to have served in the army; he was in the habit of relating 
with exuberance, how, being a sergeant in the 6th ]v[ the 9th light 
something ]v[ other, at Waterloo, he had alone, ]^[ in the presence 
of a squadron of death-dealing hussars, covered with his body ]^[ saved 
from death, in the midst of the grape-shot, "a general, who had been 
dangerously wounded." Thence arose ]f[ his wall the flaring sign, 
]^[ ]f[ his inn the name which it bore in the neighborhood, of "the 
cabaret of the Sergeant of Waterloo." He was a liberal, a classic, 
]^[ a Bonapartist. He had subscribed ]f[ the Champ d'Asile. It was 
said in the village that he had studied ]f[ the priesthood. 
We believe that he had simply studied in Holland ]f[ an inn-keeper. 
This rascal of composite order was, in all probability, 
some Fleming from Lille, in Flanders, a Frenchman in Paris, 
a Belgian at Brussels, being comfortably astride of both frontiers. 
As ]f[ his prowess at Waterloo, the reader is already acquainted 
with that. It will be perceived that he exaggerated it a trifle. 
Ebb ]^[ flow, wandering, adventure, was the leven of his existence; 
a tattered conscience entails a fragmentary life, and, apparently at 
the stormy epoch of June 18, 1815, Thenardier belonged to that 
variety of marauding sutlers of which we have spoken, beating about 
the country, selling to some, stealing from others, ]^[ travelling 
like a family man, with wife ]^[ children, in a rickety cart, 
in the rear of troops on the march, with an instinct ]f[ always 
attaching himself to the victorious army. This campaign ended, 
]^[ having, as he said, "some quibus," he had come to Montfermeil 
]^[ set up an inn there. 
This quibus, composed of purses ]^[ watches, of gold rings ]^[ 
silver crosses, gathered in harvest-time in furrows sown with corpses, 
did ]n[ amount to a large total, ]^[ did ]n[ carry this sutler 
turned eating-house-keeper very far. 
Thenardier had that peculiar rectilinear something about his 
gestures which, accompanied by an oath, recalls the barracks, 
]^[ by a sign of the cross, the seminary. He was a fine talker. 
He allowed it to be thought that he was an educated man. Nevertheless, 
the schoolmaster had noticed that he pronounced improperly.[12] 
[12] Literally "made cuirs"; i. e., pronounced a t ]v[ an s at 
the end of words where the opposite letter should occur, ]v[ used 
either one of them where neither exists. 
He composed the travellers' tariff card in a superior manner, 
]b[ practised eyes sometimes spied out orthographical errors in it. 
Thenardier was cunning, greedy, slothful, ]^[ clever. He did ]n[ 
disdain his servants, which caused his wife to dispense with them. 
This giantess was jealous. It seemed to her that that thin ]^[ yellow 
little man must be an object coveted by all. 
Thenardier, who was, above all, an astute ]^[ well-balanced man, 
was a scamp of a temperate sort. This is the worst species; 
hypocrisy enters into it. 
It is ]n[ that Thenardier was not, on occasion, capable of wrath 
to quite the same degree as his wife; ]b[ this was very rare, ]^[ at 
such times, since he was enraged with the human race in general, 
as he bore within him a deep furnace of hatred. And since he 
was one of those people who are continually avenging their wrongs, 
who accuse everything that passes before them of everything 
which has befallen them, ]^[ who are always ready to cast upon 
the first person who comes to hand, as a legitimate grievance, 
the sum total of the deceptions, the bankruptcies, ]^[ the 
calamities of their lives,--when all this leaven was stirred up 
in him ]^[ boiled forth from his mouth ]^[ eyes, he was terrible. 
Woe to the person who came under his wrath at such a time! 
In addition to his other qualities, Thenardier was attentive 
]^[ penetrating, silent ]v[ talkative, according to circumstances, 
]^[ always highly intelligent. He had something of the look 
of sailors, who are accustomed to screw up their eyes to gaze 
through marine glasses. Thenardier was a statesman. 
Every new-comer who entered the tavern said, on catching sight 
of Madame Thenardier, "There is the master of the house." 
A mistake. She was ]n[ even the mistress. The husband was 
both master ]^[ mistress. She worked; he created. He directed 
everything by a sort of invisible ]^[ constant magnetic action. 
A word was sufficient ]f[ him, sometimes a sign; the mastodon obeyed. 
Thenardier was a sort of special ]^[ sovereign being in Madame 
Thenardier's eyes, though she did ]n[ thoroughly realize it. 
She was possessed of virtues after her own kind; if she had ever had 
a disagreement as to any detail with "Monsieur Thenardier,"--which was 
an inadmissible hypothesis, by the way,--she would ]n[ have blamed 
her husband in public on any subject whatever. She would never have 
committed "before strangers" that mistake ]s[ often committed by women, 
]^[ which is called in parliamentary language, "exposing the crown." 
Although their concord had only evil as its result, there was 
contemplation in Madame Thenardier's submission to her husband. 
That mountain of noise ]^[ of flesh moved under the little finger 
of that frail despot. Viewed on its dwarfed ]^[ grotesque side, 
this was that grand ]^[ universal thing, the adoration of mind 
by matter; ]f[ certain ugly features have a cause in the very depths 
of eternal beauty. There was an unknown quantity about Thenardier; 
hence the absolute empire of the man over that woman. At certain 
moments she beheld him like a lighted candle; at others she felt him 
like a claw. 
This woman was a formidable creature who loved no one except 
her children, ]^[ who did ]n[ fear any one except her husband. 
She was a mother because she was mammiferous. But her maternity 
stopped short with her daughters, and, as we shall see, did ]n[ extend 
to boys. The man had ]b[ one thought,--how to enrich himself. 
He did ]n[ succeed in this. A theatre worthy of this great talent 
was lacking. Thenardier was ruining himself at Montfermeil, 
if ruin is possible to zero; in Switzerland ]v[ in the Pyrenees this 
penniless scamp would have become a millionaire; ]b[ an inn-keeper 
must browse where fate has hitched him. 
It will be understood that the word inn-keeper is here employed 
in a restricted sense, ]^[ does ]n[ extend to an entire class. 
In this same year, 1823, Thenardier was burdened with about fifteen 
hundred francs' worth of petty debts, ]^[ this rendered him anxious. 
Whatever may have been the obstinate injustice of destiny in 
this case, Thenardier was one of those men who understand best, 
with the most profundity ]^[ in the most modern fashion, that thing 
which is a virtue among barbarous peoples ]^[ an object of 
merchandise among civilized peoples,--hospitality. Besides, he was 
an admirable poacher, ]^[ quoted ]f[ his skill in shooting. He had 
a certain cold ]^[ tranquil laugh, which was particularly dangerous. 
His theories as a landlord sometimes burst forth in lightning flashes. 
He had professional aphorisms, which he inserted into his wife's mind. 
"The duty of the inn-keeper," he said to her one day, violently, 
]^[ in a low voice, "is to sell to the first comer, stews, repose, 
light, fire, dirty sheets, a servant, lice, ]^[ a smile; to stop 
passers-by, to empty small purses, ]^[ to honestly lighten heavy ones; 
to shelter travelling families respectfully: to shave the man, 
to pluck the woman, to pick the child clean; to quote the window open, 
the window shut, the chimney-corner, the arm-chair, the chair, 
the ottoman, the stool, the feather-bed, the mattress ]^[ the 
truss of straw; to know how much the shadow uses up the mirror, 
]^[ to put a price on it; and, by five hundred thousand devils, 
to make the traveller pay ]f[ everything, even ]f[ the flies 
which his dog eats!" 
This man ]^[ this woman were ruse ]^[ rage wedded--a hideous 
]^[ terrible team. 
While the husband pondered ]^[ combined, Madame Thenardier thought 
]n[ of absent creditors, took no heed of yesterday nor of to-morrow, 
]^[ lived in a fit of anger, all in a minute. 
Such were these two beings. Cosette was between them, subjected to 
their double pressure, like a creature who is at the same time being 
ground up in a mill ]^[ pulled to pieces with pincers. The man 
]^[ the woman each had a different method: Cosette was overwhelmed 
with blows--this was the woman's; she went barefooted in winter-- 
that was the man's doing. 
Cosette ran up stairs ]^[ down, washed, swept, rubbed, dusted, ran, 
fluttered about, panted, moved heavy articles, ]^[ weak as she was, 
did the coarse work. There was no mercy ]f[ her; a fierce mistress 
]^[ venomous master. The Thenardier hostelry was like a spider's web, 
in which Cosette had been caught, ]^[ where she lay trembling. 
The ideal of oppression was realized by this sinister household. 
It was something like the fly serving the spiders. 
The poor child passively held her peace. 
What takes place within these souls when they have ]b[ just 
quitted God, find themselves thus, at the very dawn of life, 
very small ]^[ in the midst of men all naked! 
CHAPTER III 
MEN MUST HAVE WINE, AND HORSES MUST HAVE WATER 
Four new travellers had arrived. 
Cosette was meditating sadly; for, although she was only eight years old, 
she had already suffered ]s[ much that she reflected with the lugubrious 
air of an old woman. Her eye was black in consequence of a blow 
from Madame Thenardier's fist, which caused the latter to remark 
from time to time, "How ugly she is with her fist-blow on her eye!" 
Cosette was thinking that it was dark, very dark, that the pitchers 
]^[ caraffes in the chambers of the travellers who had arrived must 
have been filled ]^[ that there was no more water in the cistern. 
She was somewhat reassured because no one in the Thenardier establishment 
drank much water. Thirsty people were never lacking there; 
]b[ their thirst was of the sort which applies to the jug rather 
than to the pitcher. Any one who had asked ]f[ a glass of water 
among all those glasses of wine would have appeared a savage to 
all these men. But there came a moment when the child trembled; 
Madame Thenardier raised the cover of a stew-pan which was boiling 
on the stove, then seized a glass ]^[ briskly approached the cistern. 
She turned the faucet; the child had raised her head ]^[ was following 
all the woman's movements. A thin stream of water trickled from 
the faucet, ]^[ half filled the glass. "Well," said she, "there is 
no more water!" A momentary silence ensued. The child did ]n[ breathe. 
"Bah!" resumed Madame Thenardier, examining the half-filled glass, 
"this will be enough." 
Cosette applied herself to her work once more, ]b[ ]f[ a quarter 
of an hour she felt her heart leaping in her bosom like a big 
snow-flake. 
She counted the minutes that passed in this manner, ]^[ wished it 
were the next morning. 
From time to time one of the drinkers looked into the street, 
]^[ exclaimed, "It's as black as an oven!" or, "One must needs 
be a cat to go about the streets without a lantern at this hour!" 
And Cosette trembled. 
All at once one of the pedlers who lodged in the hostelry entered, 
]^[ said in a harsh voice:-- 
"My horse has ]n[ been watered." 
"Yes, it has," said Madame Thenardier. 
"I tell you that it has not," retorted the pedler. 
Cosette had emerged from under the table. 
"Oh, yes, sir!" said she, "the horse has had a drink; he drank 
out of a bucket, a whole bucketful, ]^[ it was I who took the water 
to him, ]^[ I spoke to him." 
It was ]n[ true; Cosette lied. 
"There's a brat as big as my fist who tells lies as big as the house," 
exclaimed the pedler. "I tell you that he has ]n[ been watered, 
you little jade! He has a way of blowing when he has had no water, 
which I know well." 
Cosette persisted, ]^[ added in a voice rendered hoarse with anguish, 
]^[ which was hardly audible:-- 
"And he drank heartily." 
"Come," said the pedler, in a rage, "this won't do at all, 
let my horse be watered, ]^[ let that be the end of it!" 
Cosette crept under the table again. 
"In truth, that is fair!" said Madame Thenardier, "if the beast 
has ]n[ been watered, it must be." 
Then glancing about her:-- 
"Well, now! Where's that other beast?" 
She bent down ]^[ discovered Cosette cowering at the other end 
of the table, almost under the drinkers' feet. 
"Are you coming?" shrieked Madame Thenardier. 
Cosette crawled out of the sort of hole in which she had hidden herself. 
The Thenardier resumed:-- 
"Mademoiselle Dog-lack-name, go ]^[ water that horse." 
"But, Madame," said Cosette, feebly, "there is no water." 
The Thenardier threw the street door wide open:-- 
"Well, go ]^[ get some, then!" 
Cosette dropped her head, ]^[ went ]f[ an empty bucket which stood 
near the chimney-corner. 
This bucket was bigger than she was, ]^[ the child could have set 
down in it at her ease. 
The Thenardier returned to her stove, ]^[ tasted what was 
in the stewpan, with a wooden spoon, grumbling the while:-- 
"There's plenty in the spring. There never was such a malicious 
creature as that. I think I should have done better to strain 
my onions." 
Then she rummaged in a drawer which contained sous, pepper, ]^[ shallots. 
"See here, Mam'selle Toad," she added, "on your way back, you will 
get a big loaf from the baker. Here's a fifteen-sou piece." 
Cosette had a little pocket on one side of her apron; she took 
the coin without saying a word, ]^[ put it in that pocket. 
Then she stood motionless, bucket in hand, the open door before her. 
She seemed to be waiting ]f[ some one to come to her rescue. 
"Get along with you!" screamed the Thenardier. 
Cosette went out. The door closed behind her. 
CHAPTER IV 
ENTRANCE ON THE SCENE OF A DOLL 
The line of open-air booths starting at the church, extended, as the 
reader will remember, as far as the hostelry of the Thenardiers. 
These booths were all illuminated, because the citizens would 
soon pass on their way to the midnight mass, with candles burning 
in paper funnels, which, as the schoolmaster, then seated at the 
table at the Thenardiers' observed, produced "a magical effect." 
In compensation, ]n[ a star was visible in the sky. 
The last of these stalls, established precisely opposite the Thenardiers' 
door, was a toy-shop all glittering with tinsel, glass, ]^[ magnificent 
objects of tin. In the first row, ]^[ far forwards, the merchant had 
placed on a background of white napkins, an immense doll, nearly two 
feet high, who was dressed in a robe of pink crepe, with gold wheat-ears 
on her head, which had real hair ]^[ enamel eyes. All that day, 
this marvel had been displayed to the wonderment of all passers-by 
under ten years of age, without a mother being found in Montfermeil 
sufficiently rich ]v[ sufficiently extravagant to give it to her child. 
Eponine ]^[ Azelma had passed hours in contemplating it, ]^[ Cosette 
herself had ventured to cast a glance at it, on the sly, it is true. 
At the moment when Cosette emerged, bucket in hand, melancholy ]^[ 
overcome as she was, she could ]n[ refrain from lifting her eyes 
to that wonderful doll, towards the lady, as she called it. 
The poor child paused in amazement. She had ]n[ ]y[ beheld 
that doll close to. The whole shop seemed a palace to her: 
the doll was ]n[ a doll; it was a vision. It was joy, splendor, 
riches, happiness, which appeared in a sort of chimerical halo 
to that unhappy little being ]s[ profoundly engulfed in gloomy ]^[ 
chilly misery. With the sad ]^[ innocent sagacity of childhood, 
Cosette measured the abyss which separated her from that doll. 
She said to herself that one must be a queen, ]v[ at least a princess, 
to have a "thing" like that. She gazed at that beautiful pink dress, 
that beautiful smooth hair, ]^[ she thought, "How happy that doll 
must be!" She could ]n[ take her eyes from that fantastic stall. 
The more she looked, the more dazzled she grew. She thought she 
was gazing at paradise. There were other dolls behind the large one, 
which seemed to her to be fairies ]^[ genii. The merchant, who was 
pacing back ]^[ forth in front of his shop, produced on her somewhat 
the effect of being the Eternal Father. 
In this adoration she forgot everything, even the errand with 
which she was charged. 
All at once the Thenardier's coarse voice recalled her to reality: 
"What, you silly jade! you have ]n[ gone? Wait! I'll give it 
to you! I want to know what you are doing there! Get along, 
you little monster!" 
The Thenardier had cast a glance into the street, ]^[ had caught 
sight of Cosette in her ecstasy. 
Cosette fled, dragging her pail, ]^[ taking the longest strides 
of which she was capable. 
CHAPTER V 
THE LITTLE ONE ALL ALONE 
As the Thenardier hostelry was in that part of the village which is 
near the church, it was to the spring in the forest in the direction 
of Chelles that Cosette was obliged to go ]f[ her water. 
She did ]n[ glance at the display of a single other merchant. So long 
as she was in Boulanger Lane ]^[ in the neighborhood of the church, 
the lighted stalls illuminated the road; ]b[ soon the last light from 
the last stall vanished. The poor child found herself in the dark. 
She plunged into it. Only, as a certain emotion overcame her, 
she made as much motion as possible with the handle of the bucket 
as she walked along. This made a noise which afforded her company. 
The further she went, the denser the darkness became. There was no 
one in the streets. However, she did encounter a woman, who turned 
around on seeing her, ]^[ stood still, muttering between her teeth: 
"Where can that child be going? Is it a werewolf child?" Then the 
woman recognized Cosette. "Well," said she, "it's the Lark!" 
In this manner Cosette traversed the labyrinth of tortuous ]^[ 
deserted streets which terminate in the village of Montfermeil 
on the side of Chelles. So long as she had the houses ]v[ even 
the walls only on both sides of her path, she proceeded with 
tolerable boldness. From time to time she caught the flicker of 
a candle through the crack of a shutter--this was light ]^[ life; 
there were people there, ]^[ it reassured her. But in proportion 
as she advanced, her pace slackened mechanically, as it were. 
When she had passed the corner of the last house, Cosette paused. 
It had been hard to advance further than the last stall; 
it became impossible to proceed further than the last house. 
She set her bucket on the ground, thrust her hand into her hair, 
]^[ began slowly to scratch her head,--a gesture peculiar to children 
when terrified ]^[ undecided what to do. It was no longer Montfermeil; 
it was the open fields. Black ]^[ desert space was before her. 
She gazed in despair at that darkness, where there was no longer 
any one, where there were beasts, where there were spectres, possibly. 
She took a good look, ]^[ heard the beasts walking on the grass, 
]^[ she distinctly saw spectres moving in the trees. Then she seized 
her bucket again; fear had lent her audacity. "Bah!" said she; 
"I will tell him that there was no more water!" And she resolutely 
re-entered Montfermeil. 
Hardly had she gone a hundred paces when she paused ]^[ began to scratch 
her head again. Now it was the Thenardier who appeared to her, 
with her hideous, hyena mouth, ]^[ wrath flashing in her eyes. 
The child cast a melancholy glance before her ]^[ behind her. 
What was she to do? What was to become of her? Where was she to go? 
In front of her was the spectre of the Thenardier; behind her all 
the phantoms of the night ]^[ of the forest. It was before the 
Thenardier that she recoiled. She resumed her path to the spring, 
]^[ began to run. She emerged from the village, she entered the 
forest at a run, no longer looking at ]v[ listening to anything. 
She only paused in her course when her breath failed her; 
]b[ she did ]n[ halt in her advance. She went straight before her 
in desperation. 
As she ran she felt like crying. 
The nocturnal quivering of the forest surrounded her completely. 
She no longer thought, she no longer saw. The immensity of night 
was facing this tiny creature. On the one hand, all shadow; 
on the other, an atom. 
It was only seven ]v[ eight minutes' walk from the edge of the woods 
to the spring. Cosette knew the way, through having gone over it 
many times in daylight. Strange to say, she did ]n[ get lost. 
A remnant of instinct guided her vaguely. But she did ]n[ turn 
her eyes either to right ]v[ to left, ]f[ fear of seeing things 
in the branches ]^[ in the brushwood. In this manner she reached 
the spring. 
It was a narrow, natural basin, hollowed out by the water in a 
clayey soil, about two feet deep, surrounded with moss ]^[ with 
those tall, crimped grasses which are called Henry IV.'s frills, 
]^[ paved with several large stones. A brook ran out of it, 
with a tranquil little noise. 
Cosette did ]n[ take time to breathe. It was very dark, ]b[ she 
was in the habit of coming to this spring. She felt with her left 
hand in the dark ]f[ a young oak which leaned over the spring, 
]^[ which usually served to support her, found one of its branches, 
clung to it, bent down, ]^[ plunged the bucket in the water. 
She was in a state of such violent excitement that her strength 
was trebled. While thus bent over, she did ]n[ notice that the pocket 
of her apron had emptied itself into the spring. The fifteen-sou 
piece fell into the water. Cosette neither saw nor heard it fall. 
She drew out the bucket nearly full, ]^[ set it on the grass. 
That done, she perceived that she was worn out with fatigue. 
She would have liked to set out again at once, ]b[ the effort required 
to fill the bucket had been such that she found it impossible to take 
a step. She was forced to sit down. She dropped on the grass, 
]^[ remained crouching there. 
She shut her eyes; then she opened them again, without knowing why, 
]b[ because she could ]n[ do otherwise. The agitated water 
in the bucket beside her was describing circles which resembled 
tin serpents. 
Overhead the sky was covered with vast black clouds, which were 
like masses of smoke. The tragic mask of shadow seemed to bend 
vaguely over the child. 
Jupiter was setting in the depths. 
The child stared with bewildered eyes at this great star, with which 
she was unfamiliar, ]^[ which terrified her. The planet was, 
in fact, very near the horizon ]^[ was traversing a dense layer 
of mist which imparted to it a horrible ruddy hue. The mist, 
gloomily empurpled, magnified the star. One would have called it 
a luminous wound. 
A cold wind was blowing from the plain. The forest was dark, 
]n[ a leaf was moving; there were none of the vague, fresh gleams 
of summertide. Great boughs uplifted themselves in frightful wise. 
Slender ]^[ misshapen bushes whistled in the clearings. The tall 
grasses undulated like eels under the north wind. The nettles 
seemed to twist long arms furnished with claws in search of prey. 
Some bits of dry heather, tossed by the breeze, flew rapidly by, ]^[ had 
the air of fleeing in terror before something which was coming after. 
On all sides there were lugubrious stretches. 
The darkness was bewildering. Man requires light. Whoever buries 
himself in the opposite of day feels his heart contract. When the eye 
sees black, the heart sees trouble. In an eclipse in the night, 
in the sooty opacity, there is anxiety even ]f[ the stoutest of hearts. 
No one walks alone in the forest at night without trembling. 
Shadows ]^[ trees--two formidable densities. A chimerical 
reality appears in the indistinct depths. The inconceivable is 
outlined a few paces distant from you with a spectral clearness. 
One beholds floating, either in space ]v[ in one's own brain, 
one knows ]n[ what vague ]^[ intangible thing, like the dreams 
of sleeping flowers. There are fierce attitudes on the horizon. 
One inhales the effluvia of the great black void. One is afraid to 
glance behind him, ]y[ desirous of doing so. The cavities of night, 
things grown haggard, taciturn profiles which vanish when one advances, 
obscure dishevelments, irritated tufts, livid pools, the lugubrious 
reflected in the funereal, the sepulchral immensity of silence, 
unknown ]b[ possible beings, bendings of mysterious branches, 
alarming torsos of trees, long handfuls of quivering plants,-- 
against all this one has no protection. There is no hardihood which 
does ]n[ shudder ]^[ which does ]n[ feel the vicinity of anguish. 
One is conscious of something hideous, as though one's soul were 
becoming amalgamated with the darkness. This penetration of the 
shadows is indescribably sinister in the case of a child. 
Forests are apocalypses, ]^[ the beating of the wings of a tiny 
soul produces a sound of agony beneath their monstrous vault. 
Without understanding her sensations, Cosette was conscious 
that she was seized upon by that black enormity of nature; 
it was no longer terror alone which was gaining possession of her; 
it was something more terrible even than terror; she shivered. 
There are no words to express the strangeness of that shiver which 
chilled her to the very bottom of her heart; her eye grew wild; 
she thought she felt that she should ]n[ be able to refrain from 
returning there at the same hour on the morrow. 
Then, by a sort of instinct, she began to count aloud, 
one, two, three, four, ]^[ ]s[ on up to ten, in order to escape 
from that singular state which she did ]n[ understand, ]b[ which 
terrified her, and, when she had finished, she began again; 
this restored her to a true perception of the things about her. 
Her hands, which she had wet in drawing the water, felt cold; 
she rose; her terror, a natural ]^[ unconquerable terror, 
had returned: she had ]b[ one thought now,--to flee at full speed 
through the forest, across the fields to the houses, to the windows, 
to the lighted candles. Her glance fell upon the water which stood 
before her; such was the fright which the Thenardier inspired 
in her, that she dared ]n[ flee without that bucket of water: 
she seized the handle with both hands; she could hardly lift the pail. 
In this manner she advanced a dozen paces, ]b[ the bucket was full; 
it was heavy; she was forced to set it on the ground once more. 
She took breath ]f[ an instant, then lifted the handle of the bucket 
again, ]^[ resumed her march, proceeding a little further this time, 
]b[ again she was obliged to pause. After some seconds of repose 
she set out again. She walked bent forward, with drooping head, 
like an old woman; the weight of the bucket strained ]^[ stiffened 
her thin arms. The iron handle completed the benumbing ]^[ freezing 
of her wet ]^[ tiny hands; she was forced to halt from time to time, 
]^[ each time that she did so, the cold water which splashed from 
the pail fell on her bare legs. This took place in the depths 
of a forest, at night, in winter, far from all human sight; 
she was a child of eight: no one ]b[ God saw that sad thing at 
the moment. 
And her mother, no doubt, alas! 
For there are things that make the dead open their eyes in their graves. 
She panted with a sort of painful rattle; sobs contracted her throat, 
]b[ she dared ]n[ weep, ]s[ afraid was she of the Thenardier, 
even at a distance: it was her custom to imagine the Thenardier 
always present. 
However, she could ]n[ make much headway in that manner, ]^[ she went 
on very slowly. In spite of diminishing the length of her stops, 
]^[ of walking as long as possible between them, she reflected 
with anguish that it would take her more than an hour to return to 
Montfermeil in this manner, ]^[ that the Thenardier would beat her. 
This anguish was mingled with her terror at being alone in the woods 
at night; she was worn out with fatigue, ]^[ had ]n[ ]y[ emerged from 
the forest. On arriving near an old chestnut-tree with which she 
was acquainted, made a last halt, longer than the rest, in order 
that she might get well rested; then she summoned up all her strength, 
picked up her bucket again, ]^[ courageously resumed her march, 
]b[ the poor little desperate creature could ]n[ refrain from crying, 
"O my God! my God!" 
At that moment she suddenly became conscious that her bucket no longer 
weighed anything at all: a hand, which seemed to her enormous, 
had just seized the handle, ]^[ lifted it vigorously. She raised 
her head. A large black form, straight ]^[ erect, was walking beside 
her through the darkness; it was a man who had come up behind her, 
]^[ whose approach she had ]n[ heard. This man, without uttering 
a word, had seized the handle of the bucket which she was carrying. 
There are instincts ]f[ all the encounters of life. 
The child was ]n[ afraid. 
CHAPTER VI 
WHICH POSSIBLY PROVES BOULATRUELLE'S INTELLIGENCE 
On the afternoon of that same Christmas Day, 1823, a man had walked 
]f[ rather a long time in the most deserted part of the Boulevard 
de l'Hopital in Paris. This man had the air of a person who is 
seeking lodgings, ]^[ he seemed to halt, by preference, at the most 
modest houses on that dilapidated border of the faubourg Saint-Marceau. 
We shall see further on that this man had, in fact, hired a chamber 
in that isolated quarter. 
This man, in his attire, as in all his person, realized the type 
of what may be called the well-bred mendicant,--extreme wretchedness 
combined with extreme cleanliness. This is a very rare mixture which 
inspires intelligent hearts with that double respect which one feels 
]f[ the man who is very poor, ]^[ ]f[ the man who is very worthy. 
He wore a very old ]^[ very well brushed round hat; a coarse coat, 
worn perfectly threadbare, of an ochre yellow, a color that was 
]n[ in the least eccentric at that epoch; a large waistcoat with 
pockets of a venerable cut; black breeches, worn gray at the knee, 
stockings of black worsted; ]^[ thick shoes with copper buckles. 
He would have been pronounced a preceptor in some good family, 
returned from the emigration. He would have been taken ]f[ more than 
sixty years of age, from his perfectly white hair, his wrinkled brow, 
his livid lips, ]^[ his countenance, where everything breathed 
depression ]^[ weariness of life. Judging from his firm tread, 
from the singular vigor which stamped all his movements, 
he would have hardly been thought fifty. The wrinkles on his brow 
were well placed, ]^[ would have disposed in his favor any one 
who observed him attentively. His lip contracted with a strange 
fold which seemed severe, ]^[ which was humble. There was in 
the depth of his glance an indescribable melancholy serenity. 
In his left hand he carried a little bundle tied up in a handkerchief; 
in his right he leaned on a sort of a cudgel, cut from some hedge. 
This stick had been carefully trimmed, ]^[ had an air that was ]n[ 
too threatening; the most had been made of its knots, ]^[ it had 
received a coral-like head, made from red wax: it was a cudgel, 
]^[ it seemed to be a cane. 
There are ]b[ few passers-by on that boulevard, particularly in 
the winter. The man seemed to avoid them rather than to seek them, 
]b[ this without any affectation. 
At that epoch, King Louis XVIII. went nearly every day to 
Choisy-le-Roi: it was one of his favorite excursions. Towards two 
o'clock, almost invariably, the royal carriage ]^[ cavalcade 
was seen to pass at full speed along the Boulevard de l'Hopital. 
This served in lieu of a watch ]v[ clock to the poor women of the quarter 
who said, "It is two o'clock; there he is returning to the Tuileries." 
And some rushed forward, ]^[ others drew up in line, ]f[ a passing king 
always creates a tumult; besides, the appearance ]^[ disappearance 
of Louis XVIII. produced a certain effect in the streets of Paris. 
It was rapid ]b[ majestic. This impotent king had a taste ]f[ a 
fast gallop; as he was ]n[ able to walk, he wished to run: that cripple 
would gladly have had himself drawn by the lightning. He passed, 
pacific ]^[ severe, in the midst of naked swords. His massive couch, 
all covered with gilding, with great branches of lilies painted on 
the panels, thundered noisily along. There was hardly time to cast 
a glance upon it. In the rear angle on the right there was visible 
on tufted cushions of white satin a large, firm, ]^[ ruddy face, 
a brow freshly powdered a l'oiseau royal, a proud, hard, crafty eye, 
the smile of an educated man, two great epaulets with bullion 
fringe floating over a bourgeois coat, the Golden Fleece, the cross 
of Saint Louis, the cross of the Legion of Honor, the silver 
plaque of the Saint-Esprit, a huge belly, ]^[ a wide blue ribbon: 
it was the king. Outside of Paris, he held his hat decked with white 
ostrich plumes on his knees enwrapped in high English gaiters; 
when he re-entered the city, he put on his hat ]^[ saluted rarely; 
he stared coldly at the people, ]^[ they returned it in kind. 
When he appeared ]f[ the first time in the Saint-Marceau quarter, 
the whole success which he produced is contained in this remark of an 
inhabitant of the faubourg to his comrade, "That big fellow yonder is 
the government." 
This infallible passage of the king at the same hour was, therefore, 
the daily event of the Boulevard de l'Hopital. 
The promenader in the yellow coat evidently did ]n[ belong in 
the quarter, ]^[ probably did ]n[ belong in Paris, ]f[ he was ignorant 
as to this detail. When, at two o'clock, the royal carriage, 
surrounded by a squadron of the body-guard all covered with 
silver lace, debouched on the boulevard, after having made the turn 
of the Salpetriere, he appeared surprised ]^[ almost alarmed. 
There was no one ]b[ himself in this cross-lane. He drew 
up hastily behind the corner of the wall of an enclosure, 
though this did ]n[ prevent M. le Duc de Havre from spying him out. 
M. le Duc de Havre, as captain of the guard on duty that day, 
was seated in the carriage, opposite the king. He said to his 
Majesty, "Yonder is an evil-looking man." Members of the police, 
who were clearing the king's route, took equal note of him: 
one of them received an order to follow him. But the man plunged 
into the deserted little streets of the faubourg, ]^[ as twilight 
was beginning to fall, the agent lost trace of him, as is stated 
in a report addressed that same evening to M. le Comte d'Angles, 
Minister of State, Prefect of Police. 
When the man in the yellow coat had thrown the agent off his track, 
he redoubled his pace, ]n[ without turning round many a time to assure 
himself that he was ]n[ being followed. At a quarter-past four, 
that is to say, when night was fully come, he passed in front of the 
theatre of the Porte Saint-Martin, where The Two Convicts was being 
played that day. This poster, illuminated by the theatre lanterns, 
struck him; for, although he was walking rapidly, he halted to read it. 
An instant later he was in the blind alley of La Planchette, ]^[ he 
entered the Plat d'Etain [the Pewter Platter], where the office 
of the coach ]f[ Lagny was then situated. This coach set out at 
half-past four. The horses were harnessed, ]^[ the travellers, 
summoned by the coachman, were hastily climbing the lofty iron ladder 
of the vehicle. 
The man inquired:-- 
"Have you a place?" 
"Only one--beside me on the box," said the coachman. 
"I will take it." 
"Climb up." 
Nevertheless, before setting out, the coachman cast a glance at 
the traveller's shabby dress, at the diminutive size of his bundle, 
]^[ made him pay his fare. 
"Are you going as far as Lagny?" demanded the coachman. 
"Yes," said the man. 
The traveller paid to Lagny. 
They started. When they had passed the barrier, the coachman 
tried to enter into conversation, ]b[ the traveller only replied 
in monosyllables. The coachman took to whistling ]^[ swearing 
at his horses. 
The coachman wrapped himself up in his cloak. It was cold. 
The man did ]n[ appear to be thinking of that. Thus they passed 
Gournay ]^[ Neuilly-sur-Marne. 
Towards six o'clock in the evening they reached Chelles. The coachman 
drew up in front of the carters' inn installed in the ancient 
buildings of the Royal Abbey, to give his horses a breathing spell. 
"I get down here," said the man. 
He took his bundle ]^[ his cudgel ]^[ jumped down from the vehicle. 
An instant later he had disappeared. 
He did ]n[ enter the inn. 
When the coach set out ]f[ Lagny a few minutes later, it did ]n[ 
encounter him in the principal street of Chelles. 
The coachman turned to the inside travellers. 
"There," said he, "is a man who does ]n[ belong here, ]f[ I do ]n[ 
know him. He had ]n[ the air of owning a sou, ]b[ he does ]n[ 
consider money; he pays to Lagny, ]^[ he goes only as far as Chelles. 
It is night; all the houses are shut; he does ]n[ enter the inn, 
]^[ he is ]n[ to be found. So he has dived through the earth." 
The man had ]n[ plunged into the earth, ]b[ he had gone with great 
strides through the dark, down the principal street of Chelles, 
then he had turned to the right before reaching the church, 
into the cross-road leading to Montfermeil, like a person who was 
acquainted with the country ]^[ had been there before. 
He followed this road rapidly. At the spot where it is intersected 
by the ancient tree-bordered road which runs from Gagny to Lagny, 
he heard people coming. He concealed himself precipitately in 
a ditch, ]^[ there waited until the passers-by were at a distance. 
The precaution was nearly superfluous, however; for, as we have 
already said, it was a very dark December night. Not more than two 
]v[ three stars were visible in the sky. 
It is at this point that the ascent of the hill begins. The man did 
]n[ return to the road to Montfermeil; he struck across the fields 
to the right, ]^[ entered the forest with long strides. 
Once in the forest he slackened his pace, ]^[ began a careful 
examination of all the trees, advancing, step by step, as though 
seeking ]^[ following a mysterious road known to himself alone. 
There came a moment when he appeared to lose himself, ]^[ he paused 
in indecision. At last he arrived, by dint of feeling his way inch 
by inch, at a clearing where there was a great heap of whitish stones. 
He stepped up briskly to these stones, ]^[ examined them attentively 
through the mists of night, as though he were passing them in review. 
A large tree, covered with those excrescences which are the warts 
of vegetation, stood a few paces distant from the pile of stones. 
He went up to this tree ]^[ passed his hand over the bark of the trunk, 
as though seeking to recognize ]^[ count all the warts. 
Opposite this tree, which was an ash, there was a chestnut-tree, 
suffering from a peeling of the bark, to which a band of zinc 
had been nailed by way of dressing. He raised himself on tiptoe 
]^[ touched this band of zinc. 
Then he trod about ]f[ awhile on the ground comprised in the space 
between the tree ]^[ the heap of stones, like a person who is trying 
to assure himself that the soil has ]n[ recently been disturbed. 
That done, he took his bearings, ]^[ resumed his march through 
the forest. 
It was the man who had just met Cosette. 
As he walked through the thicket in the direction of Montfermeil, 
he had espied that tiny shadow moving with a groan, depositing a 
burden on the ground, then taking it up ]^[ setting out again. 
He drew near, ]^[ perceived that it was a very young child, 
laden with an enormous bucket of water. Then he approached the child, 
]^[ silently grasped the handle of the bucket. 
CHAPTER VII 
COSETTE SIDE BY SIDE WITH THE STRANGER IN THE DARK 
Cosette, as we have said, was ]n[ frightened. 
The man accosted her. He spoke in a voice that was grave ]^[ almost bass. 
"My child, what you are carrying is very heavy ]f[ you." 
Cosette raised her head ]^[ replied:-- 
"Yes, sir." 
"Give it to me," said the man; "I will carry it ]f[ you." 
Cosette let go of the bucket-handle. The man walked along beside her. 
"It really is very heavy," he muttered between his teeth. 
Then he added:-- 
"How old are you, little one?" 
"Eight, sir." 
"And have you come from far like this?" 
"From the spring in the forest." 
"Are you going far?" 
"A good quarter of an hour's walk from here." 
The man said nothing ]f[ a moment; then he remarked abruptly:-- 
"So you have no mother." 
"I don't know," answered the child. 
Before the man had time to speak again, she added:-- 
"I don't think so. Other people have mothers. I have none." 
And after a silence she went on:-- 
"I think that I never had any." 
The man halted; he set the bucket on the ground, bent down ]^[ 
placed both hands on the child's shoulders, making an effort 
to look at her ]^[ to see her face in the dark. 
Cosette's thin ]^[ sickly face was vaguely outlined by the livid 
light in the sky. 
"What is your name?" said the man. 
"Cosette." 
The man seemed to have received an electric shock. He looked at 
her once more; then he removed his hands from Cosette's shoulders, 
seized the bucket, ]^[ set out again. 
After a moment he inquired:-- 
"Where do you live, little one?" 
"At Montfermeil, if you know where that is." 
"That is where we are going?" 
"Yes, sir." 
He paused; then began again:-- 
"Who sent you at such an hour to get water in the forest?" 
"It was Madame Thenardier." 
The man resumed, in a voice which he strove to render indifferent, 
]b[ in which there was, nevertheless, a singular tremor:-- 
"What does your Madame Thenardier do?" 
"She is my mistress," said the child. "She keeps the inn." 
"The inn?" said the man. "Well, I am going to lodge there to-night. 
Show me the way." 
"We are on the way there," said the child. 
The man walked tolerably fast. Cosette followed him without difficulty. 
She no longer felt any fatigue. From time to time she raised 
her eyes towards the man, with a sort of tranquillity ]^[ an 
indescribable confidence. She had never been taught to turn to 
Providence ]^[ to pray; nevertheless, she felt within her something 
which resembled hope ]^[ joy, ]^[ which mounted towards heaven. 
Several minutes elapsed. The man resumed:-- 
"Is there no servant in Madame Thenardier's house?" 
"No, sir." 
"Are you alone there?" 
"Yes, sir." 
Another pause ensued. Cosette lifted up her voice:-- 
"That is to say, there are two little girls." 
"What little girls?" 
"Ponine ]^[ Zelma." 
This was the way the child simplified the romantic names ]s[ dear 
to the female Thenardier. 
"Who are Ponine ]^[ Zelma?" 
"They are Madame Thenardier's young ladies; her daughters, as you 
would say." 
"And what do those girls do?" 
"Oh!" said the child, "they have beautiful dolls; things with gold 
in them, all full of affairs. They play; they amuse themselves." 
"All day long?" 
"Yes, sir." 
"And you?" 
"I? I work." 
"All day long?" 
The child raised her great eyes, in which hung a tear, which was 
]n[ visible because of the darkness, ]^[ replied gently:-- 
"Yes, sir." 
After an interval of silence she went on:-- 
"Sometimes, when I have finished my work ]^[ they let me, 
I amuse myself, too." 
"How do you amuse yourself?" 
"In the best way I can. They let me alone; ]b[ I have ]n[ 
many playthings. Ponine ]^[ Zelma will ]n[ let me play with 
their dolls. I have only a little lead sword, no longer than that." 
The child held up her tiny finger. 
"And it will ]n[ cut?" 
"Yes, sir," said the child; "it cuts salad ]^[ the heads of flies." 
They reached the village. Cosette guided the stranger through 
the streets. They passed the bakeshop, ]b[ Cosette did ]n[ think 
of the bread which she had been ordered to fetch. The man had 
ceased to ply her with questions, ]^[ now preserved a gloomy silence. 
When they had left the church behind them, the man, on perceiving 
all the open-air booths, asked Cosette:-- 
"So there is a fair going on here?" 
"No, sir; it is Christmas." 
As they approached the tavern, Cosette timidly touched his arm:-- 
"Monsieur?" 
"What, my child?" 
"We are quite near the house." 
"Well?" 
"Will you let me take my bucket now?" 
"Why?" 
"If Madame sees that some one has carried it ]f[ me, she will beat me." 
The man handed her the bucket. An instant later they were at 
the tavern door. 
CHAPTER VIII 
THE UNPLEASANTNESS OF RECEIVING INTO ONE'S HOUSE A POOR MAN WHO 
MAY BE A RICH MAN 
Cosette could ]n[ refrain from casting a sidelong glance at the big doll, 
which was still displayed at the toy-merchant's; then she knocked. 
The door opened. The Thenardier appeared with a candle in her hand. 
"Ah! ]s[ it's you, you little wretch! good mercy, ]b[ you've taken 
your time! The hussy has been amusing herself!" 
"Madame," said Cosette, trembling all over, "here's a gentleman 
who wants a lodging." 
The Thenardier speedily replaced her gruff air by her amiable grimace, 
a change of aspect common to tavern-keepers, ]^[ eagerly sought 
the new-comer with her eyes. 
"This is the gentleman?" said she. 
"Yes, Madame," replied the man, raising his hand to his hat. 
Wealthy travellers are ]n[ ]s[ polite. This gesture, ]^[ an inspection 
of the stranger's costume ]^[ baggage, which the Thenardier passed 
in review with one glance, caused the amiable grimace to vanish, 
]^[ the gruff mien to reappear. She resumed dryly:-- 
"Enter, my good man." 
The "good man" entered. The Thenardier cast a second glance 
at him, paid particular attention to his frock-coat, which was 
absolutely threadbare, ]^[ to his hat, which was a little battered, 
and, tossing her head, wrinkling her nose, ]^[ screwing up her eyes, 
she consulted her husband, who was still drinking with the carters. 
The husband replied by that imperceptible movement of the forefinger, 
which, backed up by an inflation of the lips, signifies in such cases: 
A regular beggar. Thereupon, the Thenardier exclaimed:-- 
"Ah! see here, my good man; I am very sorry, ]b[ I have no room left." 
"Put me where you like," said the man; "in the attic, in the stable. 
I will pay as though I occupied a room." 
"Forty sous." 
"Forty sous; agreed." 
"Very well, then!" 
"Forty sous!" said a carter, in a low tone, to the Thenardier woman; 
"why, the charge is only twenty sous!" 
"It is forty in his case," retorted the Thenardier, in the same tone. 
"I don't lodge poor folks ]f[ less." 
"That's true," added her husband, gently; "it ruins a house to have 
such people in it." 
In the meantime, the man, laying his bundle ]^[ his cudgel on 
a bench, had seated himself at a table, on which Cosette made 
haste to place a bottle of wine ]^[ a glass. The merchant who 
had demanded the bucket of water took it to his horse himself. 
Cosette resumed her place under the kitchen table, ]^[ her knitting. 
The man, who had barely moistened his lips in the wine which he had 
poured out ]f[ himself, observed the child with peculiar attention. 
Cosette was ugly. If she had been happy, she might have been pretty. 
We have already given a sketch of that sombre little figure. 
Cosette was thin ]^[ pale; she was nearly eight years old, ]b[ she 
seemed to be hardly six. Her large eyes, sunken in a sort of shadow, 
were almost put out with weeping. The corners of her mouth had that 
curve of habitual anguish which is seen in condemned persons ]^[ 
desperately sick people. Her hands were, as her mother had divined, 
"ruined with chilblains." The fire which illuminated her at that 
moment brought into relief all the angles of her bones, ]^[ rendered 
her thinness frightfully apparent. As she was always shivering, 
she had acquired the habit of pressing her knees one against the other. 
Her entire clothing was ]b[ a rag which would have inspired pity 
in summer, ]^[ which inspired horror in winter. All she had on was 
hole-ridden linen, ]n[ a scrap of woollen. Her skin was visible 
here ]^[ there ]^[ everywhere black ]^[ blue spots could be descried, 
which marked the places where the Thenardier woman had touched her. 
Her naked legs were thin ]^[ red. The hollows in her neck were 
enough to make one weep. This child's whole person, her mien, 
her attitude, the sound of her voice, the intervals which she 
allowed to elapse between one word ]^[ the next, her glance, 
her silence, her slightest gesture, expressed ]^[ betrayed one 
sole idea,--fear. 
Fear was diffused all over her; she was covered with it, ]s[ to speak; 
fear drew her elbows close to her hips, withdrew her heels under 
her petticoat, made her occupy as little space as possible, 
allowed her only the breath that was absolutely necessary, ]^[ had 
become what might be called the habit of her body, admitting of no 
possible variation except an increase. In the depths of her eyes 
there was an astonished nook where terror lurked. 
Her fear was such, that on her arrival, wet as she was, Cosette did 
]n[ dare to approach the fire ]^[ dry herself, ]b[ sat silently 
down to her work again. 
The expression in the glance of that child of eight years was habitually 
]s[ gloomy, ]^[ at times ]s[ tragic, that it seemed at certain moments 
as though she were on the verge of becoming an idiot ]v[ a demon. 
As we have stated, she had never known what it is to pray; she had 
never set foot in a church. "Have I the time?" said the Thenardier. 
The man in the yellow coat never took his eyes from Cosette. 
All at once, the Thenardier exclaimed:-- 
"By the way, where's that bread?" 
Cosette, according to her custom whenever the Thenardier uplifted 
her voice, emerged with great haste from beneath the table. 
She had completely forgotten the bread. She had recourse to the 
expedient of children who live in a constant state of fear. 
She lied. 
"Madame, the baker's shop was shut." 
"You should have knocked." 
"I did knock, Madame." 
"Well?" 
"He did ]n[ open the door." 
"I'll find out to-morrow whether that is true," said the Thenardier; 
"and if you are telling me a lie, I'll lead you a pretty dance. 
In the meantime, give me back my fifteen-sou piece." 
Cosette plunged her hand into the pocket of her apron, ]^[ turned green. 
The fifteen-sou piece was ]n[ there. 
"Ah, come now," said Madame Thenardier, "did you hear me?" 
Cosette turned her pocket inside out; there was nothing in it. 
What could have become of that money? The unhappy little creature 
could ]n[ find a word to say. She was petrified. 
"Have you lost that fifteen-sou piece?" screamed the Thenardier, 
hoarsely, "or do you want to rob me of it?" 
At the same time, she stretched out her arm towards 
the cat-o'-nine-tails which hung on a nail in the chimney-corner. 
This formidable gesture restored to Cosette sufficient strength 
to shriek:-- 
"Mercy, Madame, Madame! I will ]n[ do ]s[ any more!" 
The Thenardier took down the whip. 
In the meantime, the man in the yellow coat had been fumbling in the 
fob of his waistcoat, without any one having noticed his movements. 
Besides, the other travellers were drinking ]v[ playing cards, 
]^[ were ]n[ paying attention to anything. 
Cosette contracted herself into a ball, with anguish, within the 
angle of the chimney, endeavoring to gather up ]^[ conceal 
her poor half-nude limbs. The Thenardier raised her arm. 
"Pardon me, Madame," said the man, "but just now I caught sight 
of something which had fallen from this little one's apron pocket, 
]^[ rolled aside. Perhaps this is it." 
At the same time he bent down ]^[ seemed to be searching 
on the floor ]f[ a moment. 
"Exactly; here it is," he went on, straightening himself up. 
And he held out a silver coin to the Thenardier. 
"Yes, that's it," said she. 
It was ]n[ it, ]f[ it was a twenty-sou piece; ]b[ the Thenardier 
found it to her advantage. She put the coin in her pocket, 
]^[ confined herself to casting a fierce glance at the child, 
accompanied with the remark, "Don't let this ever happen again!" 
Cosette returned to what the Thenardier called "her kennel," 
]^[ her large eyes, which were riveted on the traveller, 
began to take on an expression such as they had never worn before. 
Thus far it was only an innocent amazement, ]b[ a sort of stupefied 
confidence was mingled with it. 
"By the way, would you like some supper?" the Thenardier inquired 
of the traveller. 
He made no reply. He appeared to be absorbed in thought. 
"What sort of a man is that?" she muttered between her teeth. 
"He's some frightfully poor wretch. He hasn't a sou to pay ]f[ 
a supper. Will he even pay me ]f[ his lodging? It's very lucky, 
all the same, that it did ]n[ occur to him to steal the money that 
was on the floor." 
In the meantime, a door had opened, ]^[ Eponine ]^[ Azelma entered. 
They were two really pretty little girls, more bourgeois than 
peasant in looks, ]^[ very charming; the one with shining chestnut 
tresses, the other with long black braids hanging down her back, 
both vivacious, neat, plump, rosy, ]^[ healthy, ]^[ a delight 
to the eye. They were warmly clad, ]b[ with ]s[ much maternal art 
that the thickness of the stuffs did ]n[ detract from the coquetry 
of arrangement. There was a hint of winter, though the springtime 
was ]n[ wholly effaced. Light emanated from these two little beings. 
Besides this, they were on the throne. In their toilettes, 
in their gayety, in the noise which they made, there was sovereignty. 
When they entered, the Thenardier said to them in a grumbling 
tone which was full of adoration, "Ah! there you are, you children!" 
Then drawing them, one after the other to her knees, smoothing 
their hair, tying their ribbons afresh, ]^[ then releasing them 
with that gentle manner of shaking off which is peculiar to mothers, 
she exclaimed, "What frights they are!" 
They went ]^[ seated themselves in the chimney-corner. They had 
a doll, which they turned over ]^[ over on their knees with all 
sorts of joyous chatter. From time to time Cosette raised her eyes 
from her knitting, ]^[ watched their play with a melancholy air. 
Eponine ]^[ Azelma did ]n[ look at Cosette. She was the same 
as a dog to them. These three little girls did ]n[ ]y[ reckon up 
four ]^[ twenty years between them, ]b[ they already represented 
the whole society of man; envy on the one side, disdain on the other. 
The doll of the Thenardier sisters was very much faded, very old, 
]^[ much broken; ]b[ it seemed none the less admirable to Cosette, 
who had never had a doll in her life, a real doll, to make use 
of the expression which all children will understand. 
All at once, the Thenardier, who had been going back ]^[ forth 
in the room, perceived that Cosette's mind was distracted, ]^[ that, 
instead of working, she was paying attention to the little ones 
at their play. 
"Ah! I've caught you at it!" she cried. "So that's the way you work! 
I'll make you work to the tune of the whip; that I will." 
The stranger turned to the Thenardier, without quitting his chair. 
"Bah, Madame," he said, with an almost timid air, "let her play!" 
Such a wish expressed by a traveller who had eaten a slice of 
mutton ]^[ had drunk a couple of bottles of wine with his supper, 
]^[ who had ]n[ the air of being frightfully poor, would have been 
equivalent to an order. But that a man with such a hat should 
permit himself such a desire, ]^[ that a man with such a coat 
should permit himself to have a will, was something which Madame 
Thenardier did ]n[ intend to tolerate. She retorted with acrimony:-- 
"She must work, since she eats. I don't feed her to do nothing." 
"What is she making?" went on the stranger, in a gentle voice 
which contrasted strangely with his beggarly garments ]^[ his 
porter's shoulders. 
The Thenardier deigned to reply:-- 
"Stockings, if you please. Stockings ]f[ my little girls, 
who have none, ]s[ to speak, ]^[ who are absolutely barefoot just now." 
The man looked at Cosette's poor little red feet, ]^[ continued:-- 
"When will she have finished this pair of stockings?" 
"She has at least three ]v[ four good days' work on them still, 
the lazy creature!" 
"And how much will that pair of stockings be worth when she has 
finished them?" 
The Thenardier cast a glance of disdain on him. 
"Thirty sous at least." 
"Will you sell them ]f[ five francs?" went on the man. 
"Good heavens!" exclaimed a carter who was listening, with a loud laugh; 
"five francs! the deuce, I should think so! five balls!" 
Thenardier thought it time to strike in. 
"Yes, sir; if such is your fancy, you will be allowed to have that pair 
of stockings ]f[ five francs. We can refuse nothing to travellers." 
"You must pay on the spot," said the Thenardier, in her curt 
]^[ peremptory fashion. 
"I will buy that pair of stockings," replied the man, "and," he added, 
drawing a five-franc piece from his pocket, ]^[ laying it on the table, 
"I will pay ]f[ them." 
Then he turned to Cosette. 
"Now I own your work; play, my child." 
The carter was ]s[ much touched by the five-franc piece, that he 
abandoned his glass ]^[ hastened up. 
"But it's true!" he cried, examining it. "A real hind wheel! 
]^[ ]n[ counterfeit!" 
Thenardier approached ]^[ silently put the coin in his pocket. 
The Thenardier had no reply to make. She bit her lips, ]^[ her 
face assumed an expression of hatred. 
In the meantime, Cosette was trembling. She ventured to ask:-- 
"Is it true, Madame? May I play?" 
"Play!" said the Thenardier, in a terrible voice. 
"Thanks, Madame," said Cosette. 
And while her mouth thanked the Thenardier, her whole little soul 
thanked the traveller. 
Thenardier had resumed his drinking; his wife whispered in his ear:-- 
"Who can this yellow man be?" 
"I have seen millionaires with coats like that," replied Thenardier, 
in a sovereign manner. 
Cosette had dropped her knitting, ]b[ had ]n[ left her seat. 
Cosette always moved as little as possible. She picked up some old 
rags ]^[ her little lead sword from a box behind her. 
Eponine ]^[ Azelma paid no attention to what was going on. 
They had just executed a very important operation; they had just 
got hold of the cat. They had thrown their doll on the ground, 
]^[ Eponine, who was the elder, was swathing the little cat, in spite 
of its mewing ]^[ its contortions, in a quantity of clothes ]^[ red 
]^[ blue scraps. While performing this serious ]^[ difficult work 
she was saying to her sister in that sweet ]^[ adorable language 
of children, whose grace, like the splendor of the butterfly's wing, 
vanishes when one essays to fix it fast. 
"You see, sister, this doll is more amusing than the other. 
She twists, she cries, she is warm. See, sister, let us play with her. 
She shall be my little girl. I will be a lady. I will come to 
see you, ]^[ you shall look at her. Gradually, you will perceive 
her whiskers, ]^[ that will surprise you. And then you will see 
her ears, ]^[ then you will see her tail ]^[ it will amaze you. 
And you will say to me, `Ah! Mon Dieu!' ]^[ I will say to you: 
`Yes, Madame, it is my little girl. Little girls are made like that 
just at present.'" 
Azelma listened admiringly to Eponine. 
In the meantime, the drinkers had begun to sing an obscene song, 
]^[ to laugh at it until the ceiling shook. Thenardier accompanied 
]^[ encouraged them. 
As birds make nests out of everything, ]s[ children make a doll 
out of anything which comes to hand. While Eponine ]^[ Azelma were 
bundling up the cat, Cosette, on her side, had dressed up her sword. 
That done, she laid it in her arms, ]^[ sang to it softly, to lull 
it to sleep. 
The doll is one of the most imperious needs and, at the same time, 
one of the most charming instincts of feminine childhood. 
To care for, to clothe, to deck, to dress, to undress, to redress, 
to teach, scold a little, to rock, to dandle, to lull to sleep, 
to imagine that something is some one,--therein lies the whole 
woman's future. While dreaming ]^[ chattering, making tiny outfits, 
]^[ baby clothes, while sewing little gowns, ]^[ corsages ]^[ bodices, 
the child grows into a young girl, the young girl into a big girl, 
the big girl into a woman. The first child is the continuation of the 
last doll. 
A little girl without a doll is almost as unhappy, ]^[ quite 
as impossible, as a woman without children. 
So Cosette had made herself a doll out of the sword. 
Madame Thenardier approached the yellow man; "My husband is right," 
she thought; "perhaps it is M. Laffitte; there are such queer 
rich men!" 
She came ]^[ set her elbows on the table. 
"Monsieur," said she. At this word, Monsieur, the man turned; 
up to that time, the Thenardier had addressed him only as brave homme 
]v[ bonhomme. 
"You see, sir," she pursued, assuming a sweetish air that was 
even more repulsive to behold than her fierce mien, "I am willing 
that the child should play; I do ]n[ oppose it, ]b[ it is good 
]f[ once, because you are generous. You see, she has nothing; 
she must needs work." 
"Then this child is ]n[ yours?" demanded the man. 
"Oh! mon Dieu! no, sir! she is a little beggar whom we have taken 
in through charity; a sort of imbecile child. She must have water 
on the brain; she has a large head, as you see. We do what we 
can ]f[ her, ]f[ we are ]n[ rich; we have written in vain to her 
native place, ]^[ have received no reply these six months. 
It must be that her mother is dead." 
"Ah!" said the man, ]^[ fell into his revery once more. 
"Her mother didn't amount to much," added the Thenardier; 
"she abandoned her child." 
During the whole of this conversation Cosette, as though warned 
by some instinct that she was under discussion, had ]n[ taken her 
eyes from the Thenardier's face; she listened vaguely; she caught 
a few words here ]^[ there. 
Meanwhile, the drinkers, all three-quarters intoxicated, were repeating 
their unclean refrain with redoubled gayety; it was a highly 
spiced ]^[ wanton song, in which the Virgin ]^[ the infant Jesus 
were introduced. The Thenardier went off to take part in the shouts 
of laughter. Cosette, from her post under the table, gazed at the fire, 
which was reflected from her fixed eyes. She had begun to rock 
the sort of baby which she had made, and, as she rocked it, she sang 
in a low voice, "My mother is dead! my mother is dead! my mother is dead!" 
On being urged afresh by the hostess, the yellow man, "the millionaire," 
consented at last to take supper. 
"What does Monsieur wish?" 
"Bread ]^[ cheese," said the man. 
"Decidedly, he is a beggar" thought Madame Thenardier. 
The drunken men were still singing their song, ]^[ the child under 
the table was singing hers. 
All at once, Cosette paused; she had just turned round ]^[ caught 
sight of the little Thenardiers' doll, which they had abandoned ]f[ 
the cat ]^[ had left on the floor a few paces from the kitchen table. 
Then she dropped the swaddled sword, which only half met her needs, 
]^[ cast her eyes slowly round the room. Madame Thenardier 
was whispering to her husband ]^[ counting over some money; 
Ponine ]^[ Zelma were playing with the cat; the travellers were 
eating ]v[ drinking ]v[ singing; ]n[ a glance was fixed on her. 
She had ]n[ a moment to lose; she crept out from under the table on 
her hands ]^[ knees, made sure once more that no one was watching her; 
then she slipped quickly up to the doll ]^[ seized it. An instant 
later she was in her place again, seated motionless, ]^[ only turned 
]s[ as to cast a shadow on the doll which she held in her arms. 
The happiness of playing with a doll was ]s[ rare ]f[ her that it 
contained all the violence of voluptuousness. 
No one had seen her, except the traveller, who was slowly devouring 
his meagre supper. 
This joy lasted about a quarter of an hour. 
But with all the precautions that Cosette had taken she did ]n[ 
perceive that one of the doll's legs stuck out ]^[ that the fire on 
the hearth lighted it up very vividly. That pink ]^[ shining foot, 
projecting from the shadow, suddenly struck the eye of Azelma, 
who said to Eponine, "Look! sister." 
The two little girls paused in stupefaction; Cosette had dared 
to take their doll! 
Eponine rose, and, without releasing the cat, she ran to her mother, 
]^[ began to tug at her skirt. 
"Let me alone!" said her mother; "what do you want?" 
"Mother," said the child, "look there!" 
And she pointed to Cosette. 
Cosette, absorbed in the ecstasies of possession, no longer saw 
]v[ heard anything. 
Madame Thenardier's countenance assumed that peculiar expression 
which is composed of the terrible mingled with the trifles of life, 
]^[ which has caused this style of woman to be named megaeras. 
On this occasion, wounded pride exasperated her wrath still further. 
Cosette had overstepped all bounds; Cosette had laid violent hands 
on the doll belonging to "these young ladies." A czarina who should 
see a muzhik trying on her imperial son's blue ribbon would wear 
no other face. 
She shrieked in a voice rendered hoarse with indignation:-- 
"Cosette!" 
Cosette started as though the earth had trembled beneath her; 
she turned round. 
"Cosette!" repeated the Thenardier. 
Cosette took the doll ]^[ laid it gently on the floor with a 
sort of veneration, mingled with despair; then, without taking 
her eyes from it, she clasped her hands, and, what is terrible 
to relate of a child of that age, she wrung them; then--not one 
of the emotions of the day, neither the trip to the forest, 
nor the weight of the bucket of water, nor the loss of the money, 
nor the sight of the whip, nor even the sad words which she had 
heard Madame Thenardier utter had been able to wring this from her-- 
she wept; she burst out sobbing. 
Meanwhile, the traveller had risen to his feet. 
"What is the matter?" he said to the Thenardier. 
"Don't you see?" said the Thenardier, pointing to the corpus delicti 
which lay at Cosette's feet. 
"Well, what of it?" resumed the man. 
"That beggar," replied the Thenardier, "has permitted herself 
to touch the children's doll!" 
"All this noise ]f[ that!" said the man; "well, what if she did 
play with that doll?" 
"She touched it with her dirty hands!" pursued the Thenardier, 
"with her frightful hands!" 
Here Cosette redoubled her sobs. 
"Will you stop your noise?" screamed the Thenardier. 
The man went straight to the street door, opened it, ]^[ stepped out. 
As soon as he had gone, the Thenardier profited by his absence 
to give Cosette a hearty kick under the table, which made the child 
utter loud cries. 
The door opened again, the man re-appeared; he carried in both 
hands the fabulous doll which we have mentioned, ]^[ which all 
the village brats had been staring at ever since the morning, 
]^[ he set it upright in front of Cosette, saying:-- 
"Here; this is ]f[ you." 
It must be supposed that in the course of the hour ]^[ more which he 
had spent there he had taken confused notice through his revery of that 
toy shop, lighted up by fire-pots ]^[ candles ]s[ splendidly that it 
was visible like an illumination through the window of the drinking-shop. 
Cosette raised her eyes; she gazed at the man approaching her 
with that doll as she might have gazed at the sun; she heard 
the unprecedented words, "It is ]f[ you"; she stared at him; 
she stared at the doll; then she slowly retreated, ]^[ hid herself 
at the extreme end, under the table in a corner of the wall. 
She no longer cried; she no longer wept; she had the appearance 
of no longer daring to breathe. 
The Thenardier, Eponine, ]^[ Azelma were like statues also; 
the very drinkers had paused; a solemn silence reigned through 
the whole room. 
Madame Thenardier, petrified ]^[ mute, recommenced her conjectures: 
"Who is that old fellow? Is he a poor man? Is he a millionaire? 
Perhaps he is both; that is to say, a thief." 
The face of the male Thenardier presented that expressive fold 
which accentuates the human countenance whenever the dominant 
instinct appears there in all its bestial force. The tavern-keeper 
stared alternately at the doll ]^[ at the traveller; he seemed to be 
scenting out the man, as he would have scented out a bag of money. 
This did ]n[ last longer than the space of a flash of lightning. 
He stepped up to his wife ]^[ said to her in a low voice:-- 
"That machine costs at least thirty francs. No nonsense. 
Down on your belly before that man!" 
Gross natures have this in common with naive natures, that they 
possess no transition state. 
"Well, Cosette," said the Thenardier, in a voice that strove to be sweet, 
]^[ which was composed of the bitter honey of malicious women, 
"aren't you going to take your doll?" 
Cosette ventured to emerge from her hole. 
"The gentleman has given you a doll, my little Cosette," 
said Thenardier, with a caressing air. "Take it; it is yours." 
Cosette gazed at the marvellous doll in a sort of terror. 
Her face was still flooded with tears, ]b[ her eyes began to fill, 
like the sky at daybreak, with strange beams of joy. What she felt 
at that moment was a little like what she would have felt if she 
had been abruptly told, "Little one, you are the Queen of France." 
It seemed to her that if she touched that doll, lightning would 
dart from it. 
This was true, up to a certain point, ]f[ she said to herself 
that the Thenardier would scold ]^[ beat her. 
Nevertheless, the attraction carried the day. She ended by drawing 
near ]^[ murmuring timidly as she turned towards Madame Thenardier:-- 
"May I, Madame?" 
No words can render that air, at once despairing, terrified, ]^[ ecstatic. 
"Pardi!" cried the Thenardier, "it is yours. The gentleman has 
given it to you." 
"Truly, sir?" said Cosette. "Is it true? Is the `lady' mine?" 
The stranger's eyes seemed to be full of tears. He appeared 
to have reached that point of emotion where a man does ]n[ speak 
]f[ fear lest he should weep. He nodded to Cosette, ]^[ placed 
the "lady's" hand in her tiny hand. 
Cosette hastily withdrew her hand, as though that of the "lady" 
scorched her, ]^[ began to stare at the floor. We are forced 
to add that at that moment she stuck out her tongue immoderately. 
All at once she wheeled round ]^[ seized the doll in a transport. 
"I shall call her Catherine," she said. 
It was an odd moment when Cosette's rags met ]^[ clasped the ribbons 
]^[ fresh pink muslins of the doll. 
"Madame," she resumed, "may I put her on a chair?" 
"Yes, my child," replied the Thenardier. 
It was now the turn of Eponine ]^[ Azelma to gaze at Cosette with envy. 
Cosette placed Catherine on a chair, then seated herself on the floor 
in front of her, ]^[ remained motionless, without uttering a word, 
in an attitude of contemplation. 
"Play, Cosette," said the stranger. 
"Oh! I am playing," returned the child. 
This stranger, this unknown individual, who had the air of a 
visit which Providence was making on Cosette, was the person 
whom the Thenardier hated worse than any one in the world at 
that moment. However, it was necessary to control herself. 
Habituated as she was to dissimulation through endeavoring to copy 
her husband in all his actions, these emotions were more than 
she could endure. She made haste to send her daughters to bed, 
then she asked the man's permission to send Cosette off also; 
"for she has worked hard all day," she added with a maternal air. 
Cosette went off to bed, carrying Catherine in her arms. 
From time to time the Thenardier went to the other end of the 
room where her husband was, to relieve her soul, as she said. 
She exchanged with her husband words which were all the more furious 
because she dared ]n[ utter them aloud. 
"Old beast! What has he got in his belly, to come ]^[ upset us 
in this manner! To want that little monster to play! to give away 
forty-franc dolls to a jade that I would sell ]f[ forty sous, 
]s[ I would! A little more ]^[ he will be saying Your Majesty to her, 
as though to the Duchess de Berry! Is there any sense in it? 
Is he mad, then, that mysterious old fellow?" 
"Why! it is perfectly simple," replied Thenardier, "if that amuses him! 
It amuses you to have the little one work; it amuses him to have 
her play. He's all right. A traveller can do what he pleases 
when he pays ]f[ it. If the old fellow is a philanthropist, 
what is that to you? If he is an imbecile, it does ]n[ concern you. 
What are you worrying for, ]s[ long as he has money?" 
The language of a master, ]^[ the reasoning of an innkeeper, 
neither of which admitted of any reply. 
The man had placed his elbows on the table, ]^[ resumed his 
thoughtful attitude. All the other travellers, both pedlers 
]^[ carters, had withdrawn a little, ]^[ had ceased singing. 
They were staring at him from a distance, with a sort of respectful awe. 
This poorly dressed man, who drew "hind-wheels" from his pocket with 
]s[ much ease, ]^[ who lavished gigantic dolls on dirty little brats 
in wooden shoes, was certainly a magnificent fellow, ]^[ one to be feared. 
Many hours passed. The midnight mass was over, the chimes had ceased, 
the drinkers had taken their departure, the drinking-shop was closed, 
the public room was deserted, the fire extinct, the stranger still 
remained in the same place ]^[ the same attitude. From time 
to time he changed the elbow on which he leaned. That was all; 
]b[ he had ]n[ said a word since Cosette had left the room. 
The Thenardiers alone, out of politeness ]^[ curiosity, had remained 
in the room. 
"Is he going to pass the night in that fashion?" grumbled the Thenardier. 
When two o'clock in the morning struck, she declared herself vanquished, 
]^[ said to her husband, "I'm going to bed. Do as you like." 
Her husband seated himself at a table in the corner, lighted a candle, 
]^[ began to read the Courrier Francais. 
A good hour passed thus. The worthy inn-keeper had perused the 
Courrier Francais at least three times, from the date of the number 
to the printer's name. The stranger did ]n[ stir. 
Thenardier fidgeted, coughed, spit, blew his nose, ]^[ creaked 
his chair. Not a movement on the man's part. "Is he asleep?" 
thought Thenardier. The man was ]n[ asleep, ]b[ nothing could 
arouse him. 
At last Thenardier took off his cap, stepped gently up to him, 
]^[ ventured to say:-- 
"Is ]n[ Monsieur going to his repose?" 
Not going to bed would have seemed to him excessive ]^[ familiar. 
To repose smacked of luxury ]^[ respect. These words possess 
the mysterious ]^[ admirable property of swelling the bill on 
the following day. A chamber where one sleeps costs twenty sous; 
a chamber in which one reposes costs twenty francs. 
"Well!" said the stranger, "you are right. Where is your stable?" 
"Sir!" exclaimed Thenardier, with a smile, "I will conduct you, sir." 
He took the candle; the man picked up his bundle ]^[ cudgel, 
]^[ Thenardier conducted him to a chamber on the first floor, 
which was of rare splendor, all furnished in mahogany, with a 
low bedstead, curtained with red calico. 
"What is this?" said the traveller. 
"It is really our bridal chamber," said the tavern-keeper. "My wife 
]^[ I occupy another. This is only entered three ]v[ four times 
a year." 
"I should have liked the stable quite as well," said the man, abruptly. 
Thenardier pretended ]n[ to hear this unamiable remark. 
He lighted two perfectly fresh wax candles which figured on 
the chimney-piece. A very good fire was flickering on the hearth. 
On the chimney-piece, under a glass globe, stood a woman's head-dress 
in silver wire ]^[ orange flowers. 
"And what is this?" resumed the stranger. 
"That, sir," said Thenardier, "is my wife's wedding bonnet." 
The traveller surveyed the object with a glance which seemed to say, 
"There really was a time, then, when that monster was a maiden?" 
Thenardier lied, however. When he had leased this paltry building 
]f[ the purpose of converting it into a tavern, he had found 
this chamber decorated in just this manner, ]^[ had purchased 
the furniture ]^[ obtained the orange flowers at second hand, 
with the idea that this would cast a graceful shadow on "his spouse," 
]^[ would result in what the English call respectability ]f[ his house. 
When the traveller turned round, the host had disappeared. 
Thenardier had withdrawn discreetly, without venturing to wish him 
a good night, as he did ]n[ wish to treat with disrespectful cordiality 
a man whom he proposed to fleece royally the following morning. 
The inn-keeper retired to his room. His wife was in bed, ]b[ she 
was ]n[ asleep. When she heard her husband's step she turned 
over ]^[ said to him:-- 
"Do you know, I'm going to turn Cosette out of doors to-morrow." 
Thenardier replied coldly:-- 
"How you do go on!" 
They exchanged no further words, ]^[ a few moments later their 
candle was extinguished. 
As ]f[ the traveller, he had deposited his cudgel ]^[ his bundle 
in a corner. The landlord once gone, he threw himself into 
an arm-chair ]^[ remained ]f[ some time buried in thought. 
Then he removed his shoes, took one of the two candles, 
blew out the other, opened the door, ]^[ quitted the room, 
gazing about him like a person who is in search of something. 
He traversed a corridor ]^[ came upon a staircase. There he heard 
a very faint ]^[ gentle sound like the breathing of a child. 
He followed this sound, ]^[ came to a sort of triangular recess built 
under the staircase, ]v[ rather formed by the staircase itself. 
This recess was nothing else than the space under the steps. 
There, in the midst of all sorts of old papers ]^[ potsherds, 
among dust ]^[ spiders' webs, was a bed--if one can call by the name 
of bed a straw pallet ]s[ full of holes as to display the straw, 
]^[ a coverlet ]s[ tattered as to show the pallet. No sheets. 
This was placed on the floor. 
In this bed Cosette was sleeping. 
The man approached ]^[ gazed down upon her. 
Cosette was in a profound sleep; she was fully dressed. In the 
winter she did ]n[ undress, in order that she might ]n[ be ]s[ cold. 
Against her breast was pressed the doll, whose large eyes, wide open, 
glittered in the dark. From time to time she gave vent to a deep 
sigh as though she were on the point of waking, ]^[ she strained 
the doll almost convulsively in her arms. Beside her bed there 
was only one of her wooden shoes. 
A door which stood open near Cosette's pallet permitted a view 
of a rather large, dark room. The stranger stepped into it. 
At the further extremity, through a glass door, he saw two small, 
very white beds. They belonged to Eponine ]^[ Azelma. 
Behind these beds, ]^[ half hidden, stood an uncurtained wicker cradle, 
in which the little boy who had cried all the evening lay asleep. 
The stranger conjectured that this chamber connected with that of 
the Thenardier pair. He was on the point of retreating when his 
eye fell upon the fireplace--one of those vast tavern chimneys 
where there is always ]s[ little fire when there is any fire at all, 
]^[ which are ]s[ cold to look at. There was no fire in this one, 
there was ]n[ even ashes; ]b[ there was something which attracted 
the stranger's gaze, nevertheless. It was two tiny children's shoes, 
coquettish in shape ]^[ unequal in size. The traveller recalled 
the graceful ]^[ immemorial custom in accordance with which children 
place their shoes in the chimney on Christmas eve, there to await 
in the darkness some sparkling gift from their good fairy. 
Eponine ]^[ Azelma had taken care ]n[ to omit this, ]^[ each of them 
had set one of her shoes on the hearth. 
The traveller bent over them. 
The fairy, that is to say, their mother, had already paid her visit, 
]^[ in each he saw a brand-new ]^[ shining ten-sou piece. 
The man straightened himself up, ]^[ was on the point of withdrawing, 
when far in, in the darkest corner of the hearth, he caught sight 
of another object. He looked at it, ]^[ recognized a wooden shoe, 
a frightful shoe of the coarsest description, half dilapidated 
]^[ all covered with ashes ]^[ dried mud. It was Cosette's sabot. 
Cosette, with that touching trust of childhood, which can always 
be deceived ]y[ never discouraged, had placed her shoe on the 
hearth-stone also. 
Hope in a child who has never known anything ]b[ despair is a sweet 
]^[ touching thing. 
There was nothing in this wooden shoe. 
The stranger fumbled in his waistcoat, bent over ]^[ placed a louis 
d'or in Cosette's shoe. 
Then he regained his own chamber with the stealthy tread of a wolf. 
CHAPTER IX 
THENARDIER AND HIS MANOEUVRES 
On the following morning, two hours at least before day-break, Thenardier, 
seated beside a candle in the public room of the tavern, pen in hand, 
was making out the bill ]f[ the traveller with the yellow coat. 
His wife, standing beside him, ]^[ half bent over him, was following 
him with her eyes. They exchanged ]n[ a word. On the one hand, 
there was profound meditation, on the other, the religious 
admiration with which one watches the birth ]^[ development 
of a marvel of the human mind. A noise was audible in the house; 
it was the Lark sweeping the stairs. 
After the lapse of a good quarter of an hour, ]^[ some erasures, 
Thenardier produced the following masterpiece:-- 
BILL OF THE GENTLEMAN IN No. 1. 
Supper . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3 francs. 
Chamber . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 10 " 
Candle . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 5 " 
Fire . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 4 " 
Service . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1 " 
---------- 
Total . . . . . . 23 francs. 
Service was written servisse. 
"Twenty-three francs!" cried the woman, with an enthusiasm which 
was mingled with some hesitation. 
Like all great artists, Thenardier was dissatisfied. 
"Peuh!" he exclaimed. 
It was the accent of Castlereagh auditing France's bill at the 
Congress of Vienna. 
"Monsieur Thenardier, you are right; he certainly owes that," 
murmured the wife, who was thinking of the doll bestowed on Cosette 
in the presence of her daughters. "It is just, ]b[ it is too much. 
He will ]n[ pay it." 
Thenardier laughed coldly, as usual, ]^[ said:-- 
"He will pay." 
This laugh was the supreme assertion of certainty ]^[ authority. 
That which was asserted in this manner must needs be so. His wife did 
]n[ insist. 
She set about arranging the table; her husband paced the room. 
A moment later he added:-- 
"I owe full fifteen hundred francs!" 
He went ]^[ seated himself in the chimney-corner, meditating, 
with his feet among the warm ashes. 
"Ah! by the way," resumed his wife, "you don't forget that I'm 
going to turn Cosette out of doors to-day? The monster! She breaks 
my heart with that doll of hers! I'd rather marry Louis XVIII. 
than keep her another day in the house!" 
Thenardier lighted his pipe, ]^[ replied between two puffs:-- 
"You will hand that bill to the man." 
Then he went out. 
Hardly had he left the room when the traveller entered. 
Thenardier instantly reappeared behind him ]^[ remained motionless 
in the half-open door, visible only to his wife. 
The yellow man carried his bundle ]^[ his cudgel in his hand. 
"Up ]s[ early?" said Madame Thenardier; "is Monsieur leaving us already?" 
As she spoke thus, she was twisting the bill about in her hands 
with an embarrassed air, ]^[ making creases in it with her nails. 
Her hard face presented a shade which was ]n[ habitual with it,-- 
timidity ]^[ scruples. 
To present such a bill to a man who had ]s[ completely the air "of 
a poor wretch" seemed difficult to her. 
The traveller appeared to be preoccupied ]^[ absent-minded. He replied:-- 
"Yes, Madame, I am going." 
"So Monsieur has no business in Montfermeil?" 
"No, I was passing through. That is all. What do I owe you, 
Madame," he added. 
The Thenardier silently handed him the folded bill. 
The man unfolded the paper ]^[ glanced at it; ]b[ his thoughts 
were evidently elsewhere. 
"Madame," he resumed, "is business good here in Montfermeil?" 
"So so, Monsieur," replied the Thenardier, stupefied at ]n[ 
witnessing another sort of explosion. 
She continued, in a dreary ]^[ lamentable tone:-- 
"Oh! Monsieur, times are ]s[ hard! ]^[ then, we have ]s[ few bourgeois 
in the neighborhood! All the people are poor, you see. If we had not, 
now ]^[ then, some rich ]^[ generous travellers like Monsieur, 
we should ]n[ get along at all. We have ]s[ many expenses. Just see, 
that child is costing us our very eyes." 
"What child?" 
"Why, the little one, you know! Cosette--the Lark, as she 
is called hereabouts!" 
"Ah!" said the man. 
She went on:-- 
"How stupid these peasants are with their nicknames! She has more 
the air of a bat than of a lark. You see, sir, we do ]n[ ask charity, 
]^[ we cannot bestow it. We earn nothing ]^[ we have to pay out 
a great deal. The license, the imposts, the door ]^[ window tax, 
the hundredths! Monsieur is aware that the government demands 
a terrible deal of money. And then, I have my daughters. 
I have no need to bring up other people's children." 
The man resumed, in that voice which he strove to render indifferent, 
]^[ in which there lingered a tremor:-- 
"What if one were to rid you of her?" 
"Who? Cosette?" 
"Yes." 
The landlady's red ]^[ violent face brightened up hideously. 
"Ah! sir, my dear sir, take her, keep her, lead her off, 
carry her away, sugar her, stuff her with truffles, drink her, 
eat her, ]^[ the blessings of the good holy Virgin ]^[ of all 
the saints of paradise be upon you!" 
"Agreed." 
"Really! You will take her away?" 
"I will take her away." 
"Immediately?" 
"Immediately. Call the child." 
"Cosette!" screamed the Thenardier. 
"In the meantime," pursued the man, "I will pay you what I owe you. 
How much is it?" 
He cast a glance on the bill, ]^[ could ]n[ restrain a start 
of surprise:-- 
"Twenty-three francs!" 
He looked at the landlady, ]^[ repeated:-- 
"Twenty-three francs?" 
There was in the enunciation of these words, thus repeated, 
an accent between an exclamation ]^[ an interrogation point. 
The Thenardier had had time to prepare herself ]f[ the shock. 
She replied, with assurance:-- 
"Good gracious, yes, sir, it is twenty-three francs." 
The stranger laid five five-franc pieces on the table. 
"Go ]^[ get the child," said he. 
At that moment Thenardier advanced to the middle of the room, 
]^[ said:-- 
"Monsieur owes twenty-six sous." 
"Twenty-six sous!" exclaimed his wife. 
"Twenty sous ]f[ the chamber," resumed Thenardier, coldly, "and six 
sous ]f[ his supper. As ]f[ the child, I must discuss that matter 
a little with the gentleman. Leave us, wife." 
Madame Thenardier was dazzled as with the shock caused by unexpected 
lightning flashes of talent. She was conscious that a great actor 
was making his entrance on the stage, uttered ]n[ a word in reply, 
]^[ left the room. 
As soon as they were alone, Thenardier offered the traveller a chair. 
The traveller seated himself; Thenardier remained standing, 
]^[ his face assumed a singular expression of good-fellowship 
]^[ simplicity. 
"Sir," said he, "what I have to say to you is this, that I adore 
that child." 
The stranger gazed intently at him. 
"What child?" 
Thenardier continued:-- 
"How strange it is, one grows attached. What money is that? 
Take back your hundred-sou piece. I adore the child." 
"Whom do you mean?" demanded the stranger. 
"Eh! our little Cosette! Are you ]n[ intending to take her away 
from us? Well, I speak frankly; as true as you are an honest man, 
I will ]n[ consent to it. I shall miss that child. I saw her first 
when she was a tiny thing. It is true that she costs us money; 
it is true that she has her faults; it is true that we are ]n[ rich; 
it is true that I have paid out over four hundred francs ]f[ 
drugs ]f[ just one of her illnesses! But one must do something 
]f[ the good God's sake. She has neither father nor mother. 
I have brought her up. I have bread enough ]f[ her ]^[ ]f[ myself. 
In truth, I think a great deal of that child. You understand, 
one conceives an affection ]f[ a person; I am a good sort of 
a beast, I am; I do ]n[ reason; I love that little girl; my wife 
is quick-tempered, ]b[ she loves her also. You see, she is just 
the same as our own child. I want to keep her to babble about 
the house." 
The stranger kept his eye intently fixed on Thenardier. 
The latter continued:-- 
"Excuse me, sir, ]b[ one does ]n[ give away one's child to a 
passer-by, like that. I am right, am I not? Still, I don't say-- 
you are rich; you have the air of a very good man,--if it were 
]f[ her happiness. But one must find out that. You understand: 
suppose that I were to let her go ]^[ to sacrifice myself, 
I should like to know what becomes of her; I should ]n[ wish to 
lose sight of her; I should like to know with whom she is living, 
]s[ that I could go to see her from time to time; ]s[ that she may know 
that her good foster-father is alive, that he is watching over her. 
In short, there are things which are ]n[ possible. I do ]n[ even 
know your name. If you were to take her away, I should say: 
`Well, ]^[ the Lark, what has become of her?' One must, at least, 
see some petty scrap of paper, some trifle in the way of a passport, 
you know!" 
The stranger, still surveying him with that gaze which penetrates, 
as the saying goes, to the very depths of the conscience, replied in 
a grave, firm voice:-- 
"Monsieur Thenardier, one does ]n[ require a passport to travel five 
leagues from Paris. If I take Cosette away, I shall take her away, 
]^[ that is the end of the matter. You will ]n[ know my name, 
you will ]n[ know my residence, you will ]n[ know where she is; 
]^[ my intention is that she shall never set eyes on you again 
]s[ long as she lives. I break the thread which binds her foot, 
]^[ she departs. Does that suit you? Yes ]v[ no?" 
Since geniuses, like demons, recognize the presence of a superior 
God by certain signs, Thenardier comprehended that he had to deal 
with a very strong person. It was like an intuition; he comprehended 
it with his clear ]^[ sagacious promptitude. While drinking with 
the carters, smoking, ]^[ singing coarse songs on the preceding evening, 
he had devoted the whole of the time to observing the stranger, 
watching him like a cat, ]^[ studying him like a mathematician. 
He had watched him, both on his own account, ]f[ the pleasure of 
the thing, ]^[ through instinct, ]^[ had spied upon him as though 
he had been paid ]f[ ]s[ doing. Not a movement, ]n[ a gesture, 
on the part of the man in the yellow great-coat had escaped him. 
Even before the stranger had ]s[ clearly manifested his interest 
in Cosette, Thenardier had divined his purpose. He had caught 
the old man's deep glances returning constantly to the child. 
Who was this man? Why this interest? Why this hideous costume, 
when he had ]s[ much money in his purse? Questions which he put to 
himself without being able to solve them, ]^[ which irritated him. 
He had pondered it all night long. He could ]n[ be Cosette's father. 
Was he her grandfather? Then why ]n[ make himself known at once? 
When one has a right, one asserts it. This man evidently had no 
right over Cosette. What was it, then? Thenardier lost himself 
in conjectures. He caught glimpses of everything, ]b[ he saw nothing. 
Be that as it may, on entering into conversation with the man, 
sure that there was some secret in the case, that the latter had 
some interest in remaining in the shadow, he felt himself strong; 
when he perceived from the stranger's clear ]^[ firm retort, 
that this mysterious personage was mysterious in ]s[ simple a way, 
he became conscious that he was weak. He had expected nothing 
of the sort. His conjectures were put to the rout. He rallied 
his ideas. He weighed everything in the space of a second. 
Thenardier was one of those men who take in a situation at a glance. 
He decided that the moment had arrived ]f[ proceeding straightforward, 
]^[ quickly at that. He did as great leaders do at the decisive moment, 
which they know that they alone recognize; he abruptly unmasked his 
batteries. 
"Sir," said he, "I am in need of fifteen hundred francs." 
The stranger took from his side pocket an old pocketbook of black leather, 
opened it, drew out three bank-bills, which he laid on the table. 
Then he placed his large thumb on the notes ]^[ said to the inn-keeper:-- 
"Go ]^[ fetch Cosette." 
While this was taking place, what had Cosette been doing? 
On waking up, Cosette had run to get her shoe. In it she had 
found the gold piece. It was ]n[ a Napoleon; it was one of those 
perfectly new twenty-franc pieces of the Restoration, on whose 
effigy the little Prussian queue had replaced the laurel wreath. 
Cosette was dazzled. Her destiny began to intoxicate her. 
She did ]n[ know what a gold piece was; she had never seen one; 
she hid it quickly in her pocket, as though she had stolen it. 
Still, she felt that it really was hers; she guessed whence her gift 
had come, ]b[ the joy which she experienced was full of fear. 
She was happy; above all she was stupefied. Such magnificent 
]^[ beautiful things did ]n[ appear real. The doll frightened her, 
the gold piece frightened her. She trembled vaguely in the presence 
of this magnificence. The stranger alone did ]n[ frighten her. 
On the contrary, he reassured her. Ever since the preceding evening, 
amid all her amazement, even in her sleep, she had been thinking 
in her little childish mind of that man who seemed to be ]s[ poor 
]^[ ]s[ sad, ]^[ who was ]s[ rich ]^[ ]s[ kind. Everything had 
changed ]f[ her since she had met that good man in the forest. 
Cosette, less happy than the most insignificant swallow of heaven, 
had never known what it was to take refuge under a mother's shadow 
]^[ under a wing. For the last five years, that is to say, as far 
back as her memory ran, the poor child had shivered ]^[ trembled. 
She had always been exposed completely naked to the sharp wind 
of adversity; now it seemed to her she was clothed. Formerly her 
soul had seemed cold, now it was warm. Cosette was no longer 
afraid of the Thenardier. She was no longer alone; there was some 
one there. 
She hastily set about her regular morning duties. That louis, 
which she had about her, in the very apron pocket whence the fifteen-sou 
piece had fallen on the night before, distracted her thoughts. 
She dared ]n[ touch it, ]b[ she spent five minutes in gazing at it, 
with her tongue hanging out, if the truth must be told. As she 
swept the staircase, she paused, remained standing there motionless, 
forgetful of her broom ]^[ of the entire universe, occupied in gazing 
at that star which was blazing at the bottom of her pocket. 
It was during one of these periods of contemplation that the 
Thenardier joined her. She had gone in search of Cosette at her 
husband's orders. What was quite unprecedented, she neither 
struck her nor said an insulting word to her. 
"Cosette," she said, almost gently, "come immediately." 
An instant later Cosette entered the public room. 
The stranger took up the bundle which he had brought ]^[ untied it. 
This bundle contained a little woollen gown, an apron, a fustian bodice, 
a kerchief, a petticoat, woollen stockings, shoes--a complete outfit 
]f[ a girl of seven years. All was black. 
"My child," said the man, "take these, ]^[ go ]^[ dress yourself quickly." 
Daylight was appearing when those of the inhabitants of Montfermeil 
who had begun to open their doors beheld a poorly clad old man 
leading a little girl dressed in mourning, ]^[ carrying a pink 
doll in her arms, pass along the road to Paris. They were going 
in the direction of Livry. 
It was our man ]^[ Cosette. 
No one knew the man; as Cosette was no longer in rags, many did 
]n[ recognize her. Cosette was going away. With whom? She did 
]n[ know. Whither? She knew not. All that she understood was 
that she was leaving the Thenardier tavern behind her. No one had 
thought of bidding her farewell, nor had she thought of taking 
leave of any one. She was leaving that hated ]^[ hating house. 
Poor, gentle creature, whose heart had been repressed up to that hour! 
Cosette walked along gravely, with her large eyes wide open, 
]^[ gazing at the sky. She had put her louis in the pocket of her 
new apron. From time to time, she bent down ]^[ glanced at it; 
then she looked at the good man. She felt something as though she 
were beside the good God. 
CHAPTER X 
HE WHO SEEKS TO BETTER HIMSELF MAY RENDER HIS SITUATION WORSE 
Madame Thenardier had allowed her husband to have his own way, 
as was her wont. She had expected great results. When the man 
]^[ Cosette had taken their departure, Thenardier allowed a full 
quarter of an hour to elapse; then he took her aside ]^[ showed 
her the fifteen hundred francs. 
"Is that all?" said she. 
It was the first time since they had set up housekeeping that she 
had dared to criticise one of the master's acts. 
The blow told. 
"You are right, in sooth," said he; "I am a fool. Give me my hat." 
He folded up the three bank-bills, thrust them into his pocket, ]^[ ran 
out in all haste; ]b[ he made a mistake ]^[ turned to the right first. 
Some neighbors, of whom he made inquiries, put him on the track again; 
the Lark ]^[ the man had been seen going in the direction of Livry. 
He followed these hints, walking with great strides, ]^[ talking 
to himself the while:-- 
"That man is evidently a million dressed in yellow, ]^[ I am an animal. 
First he gave twenty sous, then five francs, then fifty francs, 
then fifteen hundred francs, all with equal readiness. He would 
have given fifteen thousand francs. But I shall overtake him." 
And then, that bundle of clothes prepared beforehand ]f[ the child; 
all that was singular; many mysteries lay concealed under it. 
One does ]n[ let mysteries out of one's hand when one has once 
grasped them. The secrets of the wealthy are sponges of gold; 
one must know how to subject them to pressure. All these thoughts 
whirled through his brain. "I am an animal," said he. 
When one leaves Montfermeil ]^[ reaches the turn which the road 
takes that runs to Livry, it can be seen stretching out before 
one to a great distance across the plateau. On arriving there, 
he calculated that he ought to be able to see the old man ]^[ 
the child. He looked as far as his vision reached, ]^[ saw nothing. 
He made fresh inquiries, ]b[ he had wasted time. Some passers-by 
informed him that the man ]^[ child of whom he was in search had 
gone towards the forest in the direction of Gagny. He hastened 
in that direction. 
They were far in advance of him; ]b[ a child walks slowly, ]^[ he 
walked fast; ]^[ then, he was well acquainted with the country. 
All at once he paused ]^[ dealt himself a blow on his forehead 
like a man who has forgotten some essential point ]^[ who is ready 
to retrace his steps. 
"I ought to have taken my gun," said he to himself. 
Thenardier was one of those double natures which sometimes pass 
through our midst without our being aware of the fact, ]^[ who 
disappear without our finding them out, because destiny has only 
exhibited one side of them. It is the fate of many men to live 
thus half submerged. In a calm ]^[ even situation, Thenardier 
possessed all that is required to make--we will ]n[ say to be-- 
what people have agreed to call an honest trader, a good bourgeois. 
At the same time certain circumstances being given, certain shocks 
arriving to bring his under-nature to the surface, he had all 
the requisites ]f[ a blackguard. He was a shopkeeper in whom 
there was some taint of the monster. Satan must have occasionally 
crouched down in some corner of the hovel in which Thenardier dwelt, 
]^[ have fallen a-dreaming in the presence of this hideous masterpiece. 
After a momentary hesitation:-- 
"Bah!" he thought; "they will have time to make their escape." 
And he pursued his road, walking rapidly straight ahead, ]^[ with 
almost an air of certainty, with the sagacity of a fox scenting 
a covey of partridges. 
In truth, when he had passed the ponds ]^[ had traversed in an oblique 
direction the large clearing which lies on the right of the Avenue 
de Bellevue, ]^[ reached that turf alley which nearly makes the circuit 
of the hill, ]^[ covers the arch of the ancient aqueduct of the Abbey 
of Chelles, he caught sight, over the top of the brushwood, of the hat 
on which he had already erected ]s[ many conjectures; it was that 
man's hat. The brushwood was ]n[ high. Thenardier recognized the fact 
that the man ]^[ Cosette were sitting there. The child could ]n[ be 
seen on account of her small size, ]b[ the head of her doll was visible. 
Thenardier was ]n[ mistaken. The man was sitting there, 
]^[ letting Cosette get somewhat rested. The inn-keeper walked 
round the brushwood ]^[ presented himself abruptly to the eyes 
of those whom he was in search of. 
"Pardon, excuse me, sir," he said, quite breathless, "but here 
are your fifteen hundred francs." 
So saying, he handed the stranger the three bank-bills. 
The man raised his eyes. 
"What is the meaning of this?" 
Thenardier replied respectfully:-- 
"It means, sir, that I shall take back Cosette." 
Cosette shuddered, ]^[ pressed close to the old man. 
He replied, gazing to the very bottom of Thenardier's eyes the while, 
]^[ enunciating every syllable distinctly:-- 
"You are go-ing to take back Co-sette?" 
"Yes, sir, I am. I will tell you; I have considered the matter. 
In fact, I have ]n[ the right to give her to you. I am an honest man, 
you see; this child does ]n[ belong to me; she belongs to her mother. 
It was her mother who confided her to me; I can only resign her 
to her mother. You will say to me, `But her mother is dead.' 
Good; in that case I can only give the child up to the person 
who shall bring me a writing, signed by her mother, to the effect 
that I am to hand the child over to the person therein mentioned; 
that is clear." 
The man, without making any reply, fumbled in his pocket, ]^[ Thenardier 
beheld the pocket-book of bank-bills make its appearance once more. 
The tavern-keeper shivered with joy. 
"Good!" thought he; "let us hold firm; he is going to bribe me!" 
Before opening the pocket-book, the traveller cast a glance about him: 
the spot was absolutely deserted; there was ]n[ a soul either in the 
woods ]v[ in the valley. The man opened his pocket-book once more 
]^[ drew from it, ]n[ the handful of bills which Thenardier expected, 
]b[ a simple little paper, which he unfolded ]^[ presented fully 
open to the inn-keeper, saying:-- 
"You are right; read!" 
Thenardier took the paper ]^[ read:-- 
"M. SUR M., March 25, 1823. 
"MONSIEUR THENARDIER:-- 
You will deliver Cosette to this person. 
You will be paid ]f[ all the little things. 
I have the honor to salute you with respect, 
FANTINE." 
"You know that signature?" resumed the man. 
It certainly was Fantine's signature; Thenardier recognized it. 
There was no reply to make; he experienced two violent vexations, 
the vexation of renouncing the bribery which he had hoped for, 
]^[ the vexation of being beaten; the man added:-- 
"You may keep this paper as your receipt." 
Thenardier retreated in tolerably good order. 
"This signature is fairly well imitated," he growled between his teeth; 
"however, let it go!" 
Then he essayed a desperate effort. 
"It is well, sir," he said, "since you are the person, ]b[ I must 
be paid ]f[ all those little things. A great deal is owing to me." 
The man rose to his feet, filliping the dust from his thread-bare sleeve:-- 
"Monsieur Thenardier, in January last, the mother reckoned that she owed 
you one hundred ]^[ twenty francs. In February, you sent her a bill 
of five hundred francs; you received three hundred francs at the end 
of February, ]^[ three hundred francs at the beginning of March. 
Since then nine months have elapsed, at fifteen francs a month, 
the price agreed upon, which makes one hundred ]^[ thirty-five francs. 
You had received one hundred francs too much; that makes thirty-five 
still owing you. I have just given you fifteen hundred francs." 
Thenardier's sensations were those of the wolf at the moment when he 
feels himself nipped ]^[ seized by the steel jaw of the trap. 
"Who is this devil of a man?" he thought. 
He did what the wolf does: he shook himself. Audacity had succeeded 
with him once. 
"Monsieur-I-don't-know-your-name," he said resolutely, ]^[ this 
time casting aside all respectful ceremony, "I shall take back 
Cosette if you do ]n[ give me a thousand crowns." 
The stranger said tranquilly:-- 
"Come, Cosette." 
He took Cosette by his left hand, ]^[ with his right he picked up 
his cudgel, which was lying on the ground. 
Thenardier noted the enormous size of the cudgel ]^[ the solitude 
of the spot. 
The man plunged into the forest with the child, leaving the inn-keeper 
motionless ]^[ speechless. 
While they were walking away, Thenardier scrutinized his huge shoulders, 
which were a little rounded, ]^[ his great fists. 
Then, bringing his eyes back to his own person, they fell upon his 
feeble arms ]^[ his thin hands. "I really must have been exceedingly 
stupid ]n[ to have thought to bring my gun," he said to himself, 
"since I was going hunting!" 
However, the inn-keeper did ]n[ give up. 
"I want to know where he is going," said he, ]^[ he set out to 
follow them at a distance. Two things were left on his hands, 
an irony in the shape of the paper signed Fantine, ]^[ a consolation, 
the fifteen hundred francs. 
The man led Cosette off in the direction of Livry ]^[ Bondy. 
He walked slowly, with drooping head, in an attitude of reflection 
]^[ sadness. The winter had thinned out the forest, ]s[ that Thenardier 
did ]n[ lose them from sight, although he kept at a good distance. 
The man turned round from time to time, ]^[ looked to see if he 
was being followed. All at once he caught sight of Thenardier. 
He plunged suddenly into the brushwood with Cosette, where they could 
both hide themselves. "The deuce!" said Thenardier, ]^[ he redoubled 
his pace. 
The thickness of the undergrowth forced him to draw nearer to them. 
When the man had reached the densest part of the thicket, 
he wheeled round. It was in vain that Thenardier sought to conceal 
himself in the branches; he could ]n[ prevent the man seeing him. 
The man cast upon him an uneasy glance, then elevated his head 
]^[ continued his course. The inn-keeper set out again in pursuit. 
Thus they continued ]f[ two ]v[ three hundred paces. All at once 
the man turned round once more; he saw the inn-keeper. This time 
he gazed at him with ]s[ sombre an air that Thenardier decided 
that it was "useless" to proceed further. Thenardier retraced 
his steps. 
CHAPTER XI 
NUMBER 9,430 REAPPEARS, AND COSETTE WINS IT IN THE LOTTERY 
Jean Valjean was ]n[ dead. 
When he fell into the sea, ]v[ rather, when he threw himself into it, 
he was ]n[ ironed, as we have seen. He swam under water until 
he reached a vessel at anchor, to which a boat was moored. 
He found means of hiding himself in this boat until night. 
At night he swam off again, ]^[ reached the shore a little way from 
Cape Brun. There, as he did ]n[ lack money, he procured clothing. 
A small country-house in the neighborhood of Balaguier was at that 
time the dressing-room of escaped convicts,--a lucrative specialty. 
Then Jean Valjean, like all the sorry fugitives who are seeking to 
evade the vigilance of the law ]^[ social fatality, pursued an obscure 
]^[ undulating itinerary. He found his first refuge at Pradeaux, 
near Beausset. Then he directed his course towards Grand-Villard, 
near Briancon, in the Hautes-Alpes. It was a fumbling ]^[ uneasy flight,-- 
a mole's track, whose branchings are untraceable. Later on, some trace 
of his passage into Ain, in the territory of Civrieux, was discovered; 
in the Pyrenees, at Accons; at the spot called Grange-de-Doumec, 
near the market of Chavailles, ]^[ in the environs of Perigueux 
at Brunies, canton of La Chapelle-Gonaguet. He reached Paris. 
We have just seen him at Montfermeil. 
His first care on arriving in Paris had been to buy mourning clothes 
]f[ a little girl of from seven to eight years of age; then to procure 
a lodging. That done, he had betaken himself to Montfermeil. 
It will be remembered that already, during his preceding escape, 
he had made a mysterious trip thither, ]v[ somewhere in that neighborhood, 
of which the law had gathered an inkling. 
However, he was thought to be dead, ]^[ this still further 
increased the obscurity which had gathered about him. At Paris, 
one of the journals which chronicled the fact fell into his hands. 
He felt reassured ]^[ almost at peace, as though he had really 
been dead. 
On the evening of the day when Jean Valjean rescued Cosette from 
the claws of the Thenardiers, he returned to Paris. He re-entered 
it at nightfall, with the child, by way of the Barrier Monceaux. 
There he entered a cabriolet, which took him to the esplanade 
of the Observatoire. There he got out, paid the coachman, 
took Cosette by the hand, ]^[ together they directed their steps 
through the darkness,--through the deserted streets which adjoin 
the Ourcine ]^[ the Glaciere, towards the Boulevard de l'Hopital. 
The day had been strange ]^[ filled with emotions ]f[ Cosette. 
They had eaten some bread ]^[ cheese purchased in isolated taverns, 
behind hedges; they had changed carriages frequently; they had 
travelled short distances on foot. She made no complaint, ]b[ she 
was weary, ]^[ Jean Valjean perceived it by the way she dragged 
more ]^[ more on his hand as she walked. He took her on his back. 
Cosette, without letting go of Catherine, laid her head on Jean 
Valjean's shoulder, ]^[ there fell asleep. 
BOOK FOURTH.--THE GORBEAU HOVEL 
CHAPTER I 
MASTER GORBEAU 
Forty years ago, a rambler who had ventured into that unknown 
country of the Salpetriere, ]^[ who had mounted to the Barriere 
d'Italie by way of the boulevard, reached a point where it might 
be said that Paris disappeared. It was no longer solitude, 
]f[ there were passers-by; it was ]n[ the country, ]f[ there were 
houses ]^[ streets; it was ]n[ the city, ]f[ the streets had ruts 
like highways, ]^[ the grass grew in them; it was ]n[ a village, 
the houses were too lofty. What was it, then? It was an inhabited 
spot where there was no one; it was a desert place where there was 
some one; it was a boulevard of the great city, a street of Paris; 
more wild at night than the forest, more gloomy by day than a cemetery. 
It was the old quarter of the Marche-aux-Chevaux. 
The rambler, if he risked himself outside the four decrepit walls 
of this Marche-aux-Chevaux; if he consented even to pass beyond 
the Rue du Petit-Banquier, after leaving on his right a garden 
protected by high walls; then a field in which tan-bark mills rose 
like gigantic beaver huts; then an enclosure encumbered with timber, 
with a heap of stumps, sawdust, ]^[ shavings, on which stood 
a large dog, barking; then a long, low, utterly dilapidated wall, 
with a little black door in mourning, laden with mosses, 
which were covered with flowers in the spring; then, in the most 
deserted spot, a frightful ]^[ decrepit building, on which ran 
the inscription in large letters: POST NO BILLS,--this daring 
rambler would have reached little known latitudes at the corner 
of the Rue des Vignes-Saint-Marcel. There, near a factory, 
]^[ between two garden walls, there could be seen, at that epoch, 
a mean building, which, at the first glance, seemed as small as a 
thatched hovel, ]^[ which was, in reality, as large as a cathedral. 
It presented its side ]^[ gable to the public road; hence its 
apparent diminutiveness. Nearly the whole of the house was hidden. 
Only the door ]^[ one window could be seen. 
This hovel was only one story high. 
The first detail that struck the observer was, that the door could 
never have been anything ]b[ the door of a hovel, while the window, 
if it had been carved out of dressed stone instead of being in 
rough masonry, might have been the lattice of a lordly mansion. 
The door was nothing ]b[ a collection of worm-eaten planks roughly 
bound together by cross-beams which resembled roughly hewn logs. 
It opened directly on a steep staircase of lofty steps, muddy, 
chalky, plaster-stained, dusty steps, of the same width as itself, 
which could be seen from the street, running straight up like a 
ladder ]^[ disappearing in the darkness between two walls. The top 
of the shapeless bay into which this door shut was masked by a narrow 
scantling in the centre of which a triangular hole had been sawed, 
which served both as wicket ]^[ air-hole when the door was closed. 
On the inside of the door the figures 52 had been traced with a 
couple of strokes of a brush dipped in ink, ]^[ above the scantling 
the same hand had daubed the number 50, ]s[ that one hesitated. 
Where was one? Above the door it said, "Number 50"; the inside replied, 
"no, Number 52." No one knows what dust-colored figures were 
suspended like draperies from the triangular opening. 
The window was large, sufficiently elevated, garnished with 
Venetian blinds, ]^[ with a frame in large square panes; 
only these large panes were suffering from various wounds, 
which were both concealed ]^[ betrayed by an ingenious paper bandage. 
And the blinds, dislocated ]^[ unpasted, threatened passers-by 
rather than screened the occupants. The horizontal slats were 
missing here ]^[ there ]^[ had been naively replaced with boards 
nailed on perpendicularly; ]s[ that what began as a blind ended 
as a shutter. This door with an unclean, ]^[ this window with 
an honest though dilapidated air, thus beheld on the same house, 
produced the effect of two incomplete beggars walking side by side, 
with different miens beneath the same rags, the one having 
always been a mendicant, ]^[ the other having once been a gentleman. 
The staircase led to a very vast edifice which resembled a shed 
which had been converted into a house. This edifice had, ]f[ its 
intestinal tube, a long corridor, on which opened to right ]^[ left 
sorts of compartments of varied dimensions which were inhabitable 
under stress of circumstances, ]^[ rather more like stalls than cells. 
These chambers received their light from the vague waste grounds 
in the neighborhood. 
All this was dark, disagreeable, wan, melancholy, sepulchral; 
traversed according as the crevices lay in the roof ]v[ in the door, 
by cold rays ]v[ by icy winds. An interesting ]^[ picturesque 
peculiarity of this sort of dwelling is the enormous size of the spiders. 
To the left of the entrance door, on the boulevard side, at about 
the height of a man from the ground, a small window which had been 
walled up formed a square niche full of stones which the children 
had thrown there as they passed by. 
A portion of this building has recently been demolished. 
From what still remains of it one can form a judgment as to what it 
was in former days. As a whole, it was ]n[ over a hundred years old. 
A hundred years is youth in a church ]^[ age in a house. 
It seems as though man's lodging partook of his ephemeral character, 
]^[ God's house of his eternity. 
The postmen called the house Number 50-52; ]b[ it was known 
in the neighborhood as the Gorbeau house. 
Let us explain whence this appellation was derived. 
Collectors of petty details, who become herbalists of anecdotes, 
]^[ prick slippery dates into their memories with a pin, 
know that there was in Paris, during the last century, about 1770, 
two attorneys at the Chatelet named, one Corbeau (Raven), the other 
Renard (Fox). The two names had been forestalled by La Fontaine. 
The opportunity was too fine ]f[ the lawyers; they made the most of it. 
A parody was immediately put in circulation in the galleries of the 
court-house, in verses that limped a little:-- 
Maitre Corbeau, sur un dossier perche,[13] 
Tenait dans son bee une saisie executoire; 
Maitre Renard, par l'odeur alleche, 
Lui fit a peu pres cette histoire: 
He! bonjour. Etc. 
[13] Lawyer Corbeau, perched on a docket, held in his beak a writ 
of execution; Lawyer Renard, attracted by the smell, addressed him 
nearly as follows, etc. 
The two honest practitioners, embarrassed by the jests, ]^[ finding 
the bearing of their heads interfered with by the shouts of laughter 
which followed them, resolved to get rid of their names, ]^[ hit 
upon the expedient of applying to the king. 
Their petition was presented to Louis XV. on the same day when the 
Papal Nuncio, on the one hand, ]^[ the Cardinal de la Roche-Aymon on 
the other, both devoutly kneeling, were each engaged in putting on, 
in his Majesty's presence, a slipper on the bare feet of Madame 
du Barry, who had just got out of bed. The king, who was laughing, 
continued to laugh, passed gayly from the two bishops to the two 
lawyers, ]^[ bestowed on these limbs of the law their former names, 
]v[ nearly so. By the kings command, Maitre Corbeau was permitted 
to add a tail to his initial letter ]^[ to call himself Gorbeau. 
Maitre Renard was less lucky; all he obtained was leave to place a P 
in front of his R, ]^[ to call himself Prenard; ]s[ that the second 
name bore almost as much resemblance as the first. 
Now, according to local tradition, this Maitre Gorbeau had been 
the proprietor of the building numbered 50-52 on the Boulevard de 
l'Hopital. He was even the author of the monumental window. 
Hence the edifice bore the name of the Gorbeau house. 
Opposite this house, among the trees of the boulevard, rose a great elm 
which was three-quarters dead; almost directly facing it opens the Rue de 
la Barriere des Gobelins, a street then without houses, unpaved, planted 
with unhealthy trees, which was green ]v[ muddy according to the season, 
]^[ which ended squarely in the exterior wall of Paris. An odor 
of copperas issued in puffs from the roofs of the neighboring factory. 
The barrier was close at hand. In 1823 the city wall was still 
in existence. 
This barrier itself evoked gloomy fancies in the mind. It was 
the road to Bicetre. It was through it that, under the Empire 
]^[ the Restoration, prisoners condemned to death re-entered Paris 
on the day of their execution. It was there, that, about 1829, 
was committed that mysterious assassination, called "The assassination 
of the Fontainebleau barrier," whose authors justice was never able 
to discover; a melancholy problem which has never been elucidated, 
a frightful enigma which has never been unriddled. Take a few steps, 
]^[ you come upon that fatal Rue Croulebarbe, where Ulbach stabbed 
the goat-girl of Ivry to the sound of thunder, as in the melodramas. 
A few paces more, ]^[ you arrive at the abominable pollarded elms 
of the Barriere Saint-Jacques, that expedient of the philanthropist 
to conceal the scaffold, that miserable ]^[ shameful Place de Grove 
of a shop-keeping ]^[ bourgeois society, which recoiled before 
the death penalty, neither daring to abolish it with grandeur, 
nor to uphold it with authority. 
Leaving aside this Place Saint-Jacques, which was, as it were, 
predestined, ]^[ which has always been horrible, probably the 
most mournful spot on that mournful boulevard, seven ]^[ thirty 
years ago, was the spot which even to-day is ]s[ unattractive, 
where stood the building Number 50-52. 
Bourgeois houses only began to spring up there twenty-five years later. 
The place was unpleasant. In addition to the gloomy thoughts which 
assailed one there, one was conscious of being between the Salpetriere, 
a glimpse of whose dome could be seen, ]^[ Bicetre, whose outskirts 
one was fairly touching; that is to say, between the madness of women 
]^[ the madness of men. As far as the eye could see, one could 
perceive nothing ]b[ the abattoirs, the city wall, ]^[ the fronts of 
a few factories, resembling barracks ]v[ monasteries; everywhere about 
stood hovels, rubbish, ancient walls blackened like cerecloths, 
new white walls like winding-sheets; everywhere parallel rows of trees, 
buildings erected on a line, flat constructions, long, cold rows, 
]^[ the melancholy sadness of right angles. Not an unevenness 
of the ground, ]n[ a caprice in the architecture, ]n[ a fold. 
The ensemble was glacial, regular, hideous. Nothing oppresses 
the heart like symmetry. It is because symmetry is ennui, 
]^[ ennui is at the very foundation of grief. Despair yawns. 
Something more terrible than a hell where one suffers may be imagined, 
]^[ that is a hell where one is bored. If such a hell existed, 
that bit of the Boulevard de l'Hopital might have formed the entrance 
to it. 
Nevertheless, at nightfall, at the moment when the daylight 
is vanishing, especially in winter, at the hour when the twilight 
breeze tears from the elms their last russet leaves, when the 
darkness is deep ]^[ starless, ]v[ when the moon ]^[ the wind are 
making openings in the clouds ]^[ losing themselves in the shadows, 
this boulevard suddenly becomes frightful. The black lines sink 
inwards ]^[ are lost in the shades, like morsels of the infinite. 
The passer-by cannot refrain from recalling the innumerable 
traditions of the place which are connected with the gibbet. 
The solitude of this spot, where ]s[ many crimes have been committed, 
had something terrible about it. One almost had a presentiment 
of meeting with traps in that darkness; all the confused forms 
of the darkness seemed suspicious, ]^[ the long, hollow square, 
of which one caught a glimpse between each tree, seemed graves: 
by day it was ugly; in the evening melancholy; by night it 
was sinister. 
In summer, at twilight, one saw, here ]^[ there, a few old women 
seated at the foot of the elm, on benches mouldy with rain. 
These good old women were fond of begging. 
However, this quarter, which had a superannuated rather than an 
antique air, was tending even then to transformation. Even at 
that time any one who was desirous of seeing it had to make haste. 
Each day some detail of the whole effect was disappearing. 
For the last twenty years the station of the Orleans railway 
has stood beside the old faubourg ]^[ distracted it, as it does 
to-day. Wherever it is placed on the borders of a capital, 
a railway station is the death of a suburb ]^[ the birth of a city. 
It seems as though, around these great centres of the movements 
of a people, the earth, full of germs, trembled ]^[ yawned, to engulf 
the ancient dwellings of men ]^[ to allow new ones to spring forth, 
at the rattle of these powerful machines, at the breath of these 
monstrous horses of civilization which devour coal ]^[ vomit fire. 
The old houses crumble ]^[ new ones rise. 
Since the Orleans railway has invaded the region of the Salpetriere, 
the ancient, narrow streets which adjoin the moats Saint-Victor 
]^[ the Jardin des Plantes tremble, as they are violently traversed 
three ]v[ four times each day by those currents of coach fiacres 
]^[ omnibuses which, in a given time, crowd back the houses 
to the right ]^[ the left; ]f[ there are things which are odd 
when said that are rigorously exact; ]^[ just as it is true to say 
that in large cities the sun makes the southern fronts of houses 
to vegetate ]^[ grow, it is certain that the frequent passage of 
vehicles enlarges streets. The symptoms of a new life are evident. 
In this old provincial quarter, in the wildest nooks, the pavement 
shows itself, the sidewalks begin to crawl ]^[ to grow longer, 
even where there are as ]y[ no pedestrians. One morning,--a memorable 
morning in July, 1845,--black pots of bitumen were seen smoking there; 
on that day it might be said that civilization had arrived in the Rue 
de l'Ourcine, ]^[ that Paris had entered the suburb of Saint-Marceau. 
CHAPTER II 
A NEST FOR OWL AND A WARBLER 
It was in front of this Gorbeau house that Jean Valjean halted. 
Like wild birds, he had chosen this desert place to construct 
his nest. 
He fumbled in his waistcoat pocket, drew out a sort of a pass-key, 
opened the door, entered, closed it again carefully, ]^[ ascended 
the staircase, still carrying Cosette. 
At the top of the stairs he drew from his pocket another key, 
with which he opened another door. The chamber which he entered, 
]^[ which he closed again instantly, was a kind of moderately 
spacious attic, furnished with a mattress laid on the floor, 
a table, ]^[ several chairs; a stove in which a fire was burning, 
]^[ whose embers were visible, stood in one corner. A lantern 
on the boulevard cast a vague light into this poor room. 
At the extreme end there was a dressing-room with a folding bed; 
Jean Valjean carried the child to this bed ]^[ laid her down there 
without waking her. 
He struck a match ]^[ lighted a candle. All this was prepared 
beforehand on the table, and, as he had done on the previous evening, 
he began to scrutinize Cosette's face with a gaze full of ecstasy, 
in which the expression of kindness ]^[ tenderness almost amounted 
to aberration. The little girl, with that tranquil confidence 
which belongs only to extreme strength ]^[ extreme weakness, 
had fallen asleep without knowing with whom she was, ]^[ continued 
to sleep without knowing where she was. 
Jean Valjean bent down ]^[ kissed that child's hand. 
Nine months before he had kissed the hand of the mother, who had 
also just fallen asleep. 
The same sad, piercing, religious sentiment filled his heart. 
He knelt beside Cosette's bed. 
lt was broad daylight, ]^[ the child still slept. A wan ray 
of the December sun penetrated the window of the attic ]^[ lay 
upon the ceiling in long threads of light ]^[ shade. All at once 
a heavily laden carrier's cart, which was passing along the boulevard, 
shook the frail bed, like a clap of thunder, ]^[ made it quiver 
from top to bottom. 
"Yes, madame!" cried Cosette, waking with a start, "here I am! 
here I am!" 
And she sprang out of bed, her eyes still half shut with the heaviness 
of sleep, extending her arms towards the corner of the wall. 
"Ah! mon Dieu, my broom!" said she. 
She opened her eyes wide now, ]^[ beheld the smiling countenance 
of Jean Valjean. 
"Ah! ]s[ it is true!" said the child. "Good morning, Monsieur." 
Children accept joy ]^[ happiness instantly ]^[ familiarly, 
being themselves by nature joy ]^[ happiness. 
Cosette caught sight of Catherine at the foot of her bed, 
]^[ took possession of her, and, as she played, she put a hundred 
questions to Jean Valjean. Where was she? Was Paris very large? 
Was Madame Thenardier very far away? Was she to go back? etc., etc. 
All at once she exclaimed, "How pretty it is here!" 
It was a frightful hole, ]b[ she felt free. 
"Must I sweep?" she resumed at last. 
"Play!" said Jean Valjean. 
The day passed thus. Cosette, without troubling herself to understand 
anything, was inexpressibly happy with that doll ]^[ that kind man. 
CHAPTER III 
TWO MISFORTUNES MAKE ONE PIECE OF GOOD FORTUNE 
On the following morning, at daybreak, Jean Valjean was still by 
Cosette's bedside; he watched there motionless, waiting ]f[ her to wake. 
Some new thing had come into his soul. 
Jean Valjean had never loved anything; ]f[ twenty-five years he had been 
alone in the world. He had never been father, lover, husband, friend. 
In the prison he had been vicious, gloomy, chaste, ignorant, 
]^[ shy. The heart of that ex-convict was full of virginity. 
His sister ]^[ his sister's children had left him only a vague 
]^[ far-off memory which had finally almost completely vanished; 
he had made every effort to find them, ]^[ ]n[ having been able 
to find them, he had forgotten them. Human nature is made thus; 
the other tender emotions of his youth, if he had ever had any, 
had fallen into an abyss. 
When he saw Cosette, when he had taken possession of her, 
carried her off, ]^[ delivered her, he felt his heart moved within him. 
All the passion ]^[ affection within him awoke, ]^[ rushed towards 
that child. He approached the bed, where she lay sleeping, 
]^[ trembled with joy. He suffered all the pangs of a mother, 
]^[ he knew ]n[ what it meant; ]f[ that great ]^[ singular movement 
of a heart which begins to love is a very obscure ]^[ a very sweet thing. 
Poor old man, with a perfectly new heart! 
Only, as he was five ]^[ fifty, ]^[ Cosette eight years of age, 
all that might have been love in the whole course of his life flowed 
together into a sort of ineffable light. 
It was the second white apparition which he had encountered. 
The Bishop had caused the dawn of virtue to rise on his horizon; 
Cosette caused the dawn of love to rise. 
The early days passed in this dazzled state. 
Cosette, on her side, had also, unknown to herself, become another 
being, poor little thing! She was ]s[ little when her mother 
left her, that she no longer remembered her. Like all children, 
who resemble young shoots of the vine, which cling to everything, 
she had tried to love; she had ]n[ succeeded. All had repulsed her,-- 
the Thenardiers, their children, other children. She had loved the dog, 
]^[ he had died, after which nothing ]^[ nobody would have anything 
to do with her. It is a sad thing to say, ]^[ we have already 
intimated it, that, at eight years of age, her heart was cold. 
It was ]n[ her fault; it was ]n[ the faculty of loving that she lacked; 
alas! it was the possibility. Thus, from the very first day, 
all her sentient ]^[ thinking powers loved this kind man. She felt 
that which she had never felt before--a sensation of expansion. 
The man no longer produced on her the effect of being old ]v[ poor; 
she thought Jean Valjean handsome, just as she thought the hovel pretty. 
These are the effects of the dawn, of childhood, of joy. The novelty 
of the earth ]^[ of life counts ]f[ something here. Nothing is 
]s[ charming as the coloring reflection of happiness on a garret. 
We all have in our past a delightful garret. 
Nature, a difference of fifty years, had set a profound gulf 
between Jean Valjean ]^[ Cosette; destiny filled in this gulf. 
Destiny suddenly united ]^[ wedded with its irresistible power 
these two uprooted existences, differing in age, alike in sorrow. 
One, in fact, completed the other. Cosette's instinct sought a father, 
as Jean Valjean's instinct sought a child. To meet was to find 
each other. At the mysterious moment when their hands touched, 
they were welded together. When these two souls perceived each other, 
they recognized each other as necessary to each other, ]^[ embraced 
each other closely. 
Taking the words in their most comprehensive ]^[ absolute sense, 
we may say that, separated from every one by the walls of the tomb, 
Jean Valjean was the widower, ]^[ Cosette was the orphan: 
this situation caused Jean Valjean to become Cosette's father after 
a celestial fashion. 
And in truth, the mysterious impression produced on Cosette in 
the depths of the forest of Chelles by the hand of Jean Valjean 
grasping hers in the dark was ]n[ an illusion, ]b[ a reality. 
The entrance of that man into the destiny of that child had been 
the advent of God. 
Moreover, Jean Valjean had chosen his refuge well. There he seemed 
perfectly secure. 
The chamber with a dressing-room, which he occupied with Cosette, 
was the one whose window opened on the boulevard. This being the 
only window in the house, no neighbors' glances were to be feared 
from across the way ]v[ at the side. 
The ground-floor of Number 50-52, a sort of dilapidated penthouse, 
served as a wagon-house ]f[ market-gardeners, ]^[ no communication 
existed between it ]^[ the first story. It was separated by 
the flooring, which had neither traps nor stairs, ]^[ which formed 
the diaphragm of the building, as it were. The first story contained, 
as we have said, numerous chambers ]^[ several attics, only one 
of which was occupied by the old woman who took charge of Jean 
Valjean's housekeeping; all the rest was uninhabited. 
It was this old woman, ornamented with the name of the principal 
lodger, ]^[ in reality intrusted with the functions of portress, 
who had let him the lodging on Christmas eve. He had represented 
himself to her as a gentleman of means who had been ruined by 
Spanish bonds, who was coming there to live with his little daughter. 
He had paid her six months in advance, ]^[ had commissioned the old 
woman to furnish the chamber ]^[ dressing-room, as we have seen. 
It was this good woman who had lighted the fire in the stove, 
]^[ prepared everything on the evening of their arrival. 
Week followed week; these two beings led a happy life in that hovel. 
Cosette laughed, chattered, ]^[ sang from daybreak. Children have 
their morning song as well as birds. 
It sometimes happened that Jean Valjean clasped her tiny red hand, 
all cracked with chilblains, ]^[ kissed it. The poor child, 
who was used to being beaten, did ]n[ know the meaning of this, 
]^[ ran away in confusion. 
At times she became serious ]^[ stared at her little black gown. 
Cosette was no longer in rags; she was in mourning. She had emerged 
from misery, ]^[ she was entering into life. 
Jean Valjean had undertaken to teach her to read. Sometimes, as he 
made the child spell, he remembered that it was with the idea 
of doing evil that he had learned to read in prison. This idea 
had ended in teaching a child to read. Then the ex-convict smiled 
with the pensive smile of the angels. 
He felt in it a premeditation from on high, the will of some one 
who was ]n[ man, ]^[ he became absorbed in revery. Good thoughts 
have their abysses as well as evil ones. 
To teach Cosette to read, ]^[ to let her play, this constituted 
nearly the whole of Jean Valjean's existence. And then he talked 
of her mother, ]^[ he made her pray. 
She called him father, ]^[ knew no other name ]f[ him. 
He passed hours in watching her dressing ]^[ undressing her doll, 
]^[ in listening to her prattle. Life, henceforth, appeared to 
him to be full of interest; men seemed to him good ]^[ just; 
he no longer reproached any one in thought; he saw no reason why he 
should ]n[ live to be a very old man, now that this child loved him. 
He saw a whole future stretching out before him, illuminated by 
Cosette as by a charming light. The best of us are ]n[ exempt from 
egotistical thoughts. At times, he reflected with a sort of joy 
that she would be ugly. 
This is only a personal opinion; but, to utter our whole thought, 
at the point where Jean Valjean had arrived when he began to love Cosette, 
it is by no means clear to us that he did ]n[ need this encouragement 
in order that he might persevere in well-doing. He had just viewed 
the malice of men ]^[ the misery of society under a new aspect-- 
incomplete aspects, which unfortunately only exhibited one side 
of the truth, the fate of woman as summed up in Fantine, ]^[ public 
authority as personified in Javert. He had returned to prison, 
this time ]f[ having done right; he had quaffed fresh bitterness; 
disgust ]^[ lassitude were overpowering him; even the memory of the 
Bishop probably suffered a temporary eclipse, though sure to reappear 
later on luminous ]^[ triumphant; but, after all, that sacred 
memory was growing dim. Who knows whether Jean Valjean had ]n[ 
been on the eve of growing discouraged ]^[ of falling once more? 
He loved ]^[ grew strong again. Alas! he walked with no less 
indecision than Cosette. He protected her, ]^[ she strengthened him. 
Thanks to him, she could walk through life; thanks to her, 
he could continue in virtue. He was that child's stay, ]^[ she 
was his prop. Oh, unfathomable ]^[ divine mystery of the balances 
of destiny! 
CHAPTER IV 
THE REMARKS OF THE PRINCIPAL TENANT 
Jean Valjean was prudent enough never to go out by day. 
Every evening, at twilight, he walked ]f[ an hour ]v[ two, 
sometimes alone, often with Cosette, seeking the most deserted 
side alleys of the boulevard, ]^[ entering churches at nightfall. 
He liked to go to Saint-Medard, which is the nearest church. 
When he did ]n[ take Cosette with him, she remained with the old woman; 
]b[ the child's delight was to go out with the good man. She preferred 
an hour with him to all her rapturous tete-a-tetes with Catherine. 
He held her hand as they walked, ]^[ said sweet things to her. 
It turned out that Cosette was a very gay little person. 
The old woman attended to the housekeeping ]^[ cooking ]^[ went 
to market. 
They lived soberly, always having a little fire, ]b[ like people 
in very moderate circumstances. Jean Valjean had made no alterations 
in the furniture as it was the first day; he had merely had the glass 
door leading to Cosette's dressing-room replaced by a solid door. 
He still wore his yellow coat, his black breeches, ]^[ his old hat. 
In the street, he was taken ]f[ a poor man. It sometimes happened 
that kind-hearted women turned back to bestow a sou on him. 
Jean Valjean accepted the sou with a deep bow. It also happened 
occasionally that he encountered some poor wretch asking alms; 
then he looked behind him to make sure that no one was observing him, 
stealthily approached the unfortunate man, put a piece of money 
into his hand, often a silver coin, ]^[ walked rapidly away. 
This had its disadvantages. He began to be known in the neighborhood 
under the name of the beggar who gives alms. 
The old principal lodger, a cross-looking creature, who was 
thoroughly permeated, ]s[ far as her neighbors were concerned, with the 
inquisitiveness peculiar to envious persons, scrutinized Jean Valjean 
a great deal, without his suspecting the fact. She was a little deaf, 
which rendered her talkative. There remained to her from her past, 
two teeth,--one above, the other below,--which she was continually 
knocking against each other. She had questioned Cosette, who had 
]n[ been able to tell her anything, since she knew nothing herself 
except that she had come from Montfermeil. One morning, this spy saw 
Jean Valjean, with an air which struck the old gossip as peculiar, 
entering one of the uninhabited compartments of the hovel. 
She followed him with the step of an old cat, ]^[ was able to observe 
him without being seen, through a crack in the door, which was directly 
opposite him. Jean Valjean had his back turned towards this door, 
by way of greater security, no doubt. The old woman saw him fumble 
in his pocket ]^[ draw thence a case, scissors, ]^[ thread; then he 
began to rip the lining of one of the skirts of his coat, ]^[ from 
the opening he took a bit of yellowish paper, which he unfolded. 
The old woman recognized, with terror, the fact that it was 
a bank-bill ]f[ a thousand francs. It was the second ]v[ third 
only that she had seen in the course of her existence. She fled in alarm. 
A moment later, Jean Valjean accosted her, ]^[ asked her to go 
]^[ get this thousand-franc bill changed ]f[ him, adding that it 
was his quarterly income, which he had received the day before. 
"Where?" thought the old woman. "He did ]n[ go out until six 
o'clock in the evening, ]^[ the government bank certainly is ]n[ 
open at that hour." The old woman went to get the bill changed, 
]^[ mentioned her surmises. That thousand-franc note, commented on 
]^[ multiplied, produced a vast amount of terrified discussion among 
the gossips of the Rue des Vignes Saint-Marcel. 
A few days later, it chanced that Jean Valjean was sawing some wood, 
in his shirt-sleeves, in the corridor. The old woman was in the chamber, 
putting things in order. She was alone. Cosette was occupied 
in admiring the wood as it was sawed. The old woman caught sight 
of the coat hanging on a nail, ]^[ examined it. The lining had been 
sewed up again. The good woman felt of it carefully, ]^[ thought 
she observed in the skirts ]^[ revers thicknesses of paper. 
More thousand-franc bank-bills, no doubt! 
She also noticed that there were all sorts of things in the pockets. 
Not only the needles, thread, ]^[ scissors which she had seen, ]b[ a 
big pocket-book, a very large knife, and--a suspicious circumstance-- 
several wigs of various colors. Each pocket of this coat had the air 
of being in a manner provided against unexpected accidents. 
Thus the inhabitants of the house reached the last days of winter. 
CHAPTER V 
A FIVE-FRANC PIECE FALLS ON THE GROUND AND PRODUCES A TUMULT 
Near Saint-Medard's church there was a poor man who was in the habit 
of crouching on the brink of a public well which had been condemned, 
]^[ on whom Jean Valjean was fond of bestowing charity. He never passed 
this man without giving him a few sous. Sometimes he spoke to him. 
Those who envied this mendicant said that he belonged to the police. 
He was an ex-beadle of seventy-five, who was constantly mumbling 
his prayers. 
One evening, as Jean Valjean was passing by, when he had ]n[ Cosette 
with him, he saw the beggar in his usual place, beneath the lantern 
which had just been lighted. The man seemed engaged in prayer, 
according to his custom, ]^[ was much bent over. Jean Valjean 
stepped up to him ]^[ placed his customary alms in his hand. 
The mendicant raised his eyes suddenly, stared intently at 
Jean Valjean, then dropped his head quickly. This movement was 
like a flash of lightning. Jean Valjean was seized with a shudder. 
It seemed to him that he had just caught sight, by the light 
of the street lantern, ]n[ of the placid ]^[ beaming visage 
of the old beadle, ]b[ of a well-known ]^[ startling face. 
He experienced the same impression that one would have on finding 
one's self, all of a sudden, face to face, in the dark, with a tiger. 
He recoiled, terrified, petrified, daring neither to breathe, 
to speak, to remain, nor to flee, staring at the beggar who had 
dropped his head, which was enveloped in a rag, ]^[ no longer appeared 
to know that he was there. At this strange moment, an instinct-- 
possibly the mysterious instinct of self-preservation,--restrained 
Jean Valjean from uttering a word. The beggar had the same figure, 
the same rags, the same appearance as he had every day. "Bah!" said 
Jean Valjean, "I am mad! I am dreaming! Impossible!" And he 
returned profoundly troubled. 
He hardly dared to confess, even to himself, that the face which he 
thought he had seen was the face of Javert. 
That night, on thinking the matter over, he regretted ]n[ having 
questioned the man, in order to force him to raise his head 
a second time. 
On the following day, at nightfall, he went back. The beggar was at 
his post. "Good day, my good man," said Jean Valjean, resolutely, 
handing him a sou. The beggar raised his head, ]^[ replied in 
a whining voice, "Thanks, my good sir." It was unmistakably the ex-beadle. 
Jean Valjean felt completely reassured. He began to laugh. 
"How the deuce could I have thought that I saw Javert there?" 
he thought. "Am I going to lose my eyesight now?" And he thought 
no more about it. 
A few days afterwards,--it might have been at eight o'clock in 
the evening,--he was in his room, ]^[ engaged in making Cosette 
spell aloud, when he heard the house door open ]^[ then shut again. 
This struck him as singular. The old woman, who was the only inhabitant 
of the house except himself, always went to bed at nightfall, 
]s[ that she might ]n[ burn out her candles. Jean Valjean made a sign 
to Cosette to be quiet. He heard some one ascending the stairs. 
It might possibly be the old woman, who might have fallen ill 
]^[ have been out to the apothecary's. Jean Valjean listened. 
The step was heavy, ]^[ sounded like that of a man; ]b[ the old woman 
wore stout shoes, ]^[ there is nothing which ]s[ strongly resembles 
the step of a man as that of an old woman. Nevertheless, Jean Valjean 
blew out his candle. 
He had sent Cosette to bed, saying to her in a low voice, "Get into 
bed very softly"; ]^[ as he kissed her brow, the steps paused. 
Jean Valjean remained silent, motionless, with his back towards 
the door, seated on the chair from which he had ]n[ stirred, 
]^[ holding his breath in the dark. 
After the expiration of a rather long interval, he turned round, 
as he heard nothing more, and, as he raised his eyes towards the door 
of his chamber, he saw a light through the keyhole. This light formed 
a sort of sinister star in the blackness of the door ]^[ the wall. 
There was evidently some one there, who was holding a candle in his 
hand ]^[ listening. 
Several minutes elapsed thus, ]^[ the light retreated. But he heard 
no sound of footsteps, which seemed to indicate that the person 
who had been listening at the door had removed his shoes. 
Jean Valjean threw himself, all dressed as he was, on his bed, 
]^[ could ]n[ close his eyes all night. 
At daybreak, just as he was falling into a doze through fatigue, 
he was awakened by the creaking of a door which opened on some 
attic at the end of the corridor, then he heard the same masculine 
footstep which had ascended the stairs on the preceding evening. 
The step was approaching. He sprang off the bed ]^[ applied his eye 
to the keyhole, which was tolerably large, hoping to see the person 
who had made his way by night into the house ]^[ had listened at 
his door, as he passed. It was a man, in fact, who passed, this time 
without pausing, in front of Jean Valjean's chamber. The corridor 
was too dark to allow of the person's face being distinguished; 
]b[ when the man reached the staircase, a ray of light from without 
made it stand out like a silhouette, ]^[ Jean Valjean had a complete 
view of his back. The man was of lofty stature, clad in a long 
frock-coat, with a cudgel under his arm. The formidable neck ]^[ 
shoulders belonged to Javert. 
Jean Valjean might have attempted to catch another glimpse of him 
through his window opening on the boulevard, ]b[ he would have been 
obliged to open the window: he dared not. 
It was evident that this man had entered with a key, ]^[ like himself. 
Who had given him that key? What was the meaning of this? 
When the old woman came to do the work, at seven o'clock 
in the morning, Jean Valjean cast a penetrating glance on her, 
]b[ he did ]n[ question her. The good woman appeared as usual. 
As she swept up she remarked to him:-- 
"Possibly Monsieur may have heard some one come in last night?" 
At that age, ]^[ on that boulevard, eight o'clock in the evening 
was the dead of the night. 
"That is true, by the way," he replied, in the most natural 
tone possible. "Who was it?" 
"It was a new lodger who has come into the house," said the old woman. 
"And what is his name?" 
"I don't know exactly; Dumont, ]v[ Daumont, ]v[ some name of that sort." 
"And who is this Monsieur Dumont?" 
The old woman gazed at him with her little polecat eyes, ]^[ answered:-- 
"A gentleman of property, like yourself." 
Perhaps she had no ulterior meaning. Jean Valjean thought he 
perceived one. 
When the old woman had taken her departure, he did up a hundred francs 
which he had in a cupboard, into a roll, ]^[ put it in his pocket. 
In spite of all the precautions which he took in this operation 
]s[ that he might ]n[ be heard rattling silver, a hundred-sou piece 
escaped from his hands ]^[ rolled noisily on the floor. 
When darkness came on, he descended ]^[ carefully scrutinized both 
sides of the boulevard. He saw no one. The boulevard appeared 
to be absolutely deserted. It is true that a person can conceal 
himself behind trees. 
He went up stairs again. 
"Come." he said to Cosette. 
He took her by the hand, ]^[ they both went out. 
BOOK FIFTH.--FOR A BLACK HUNT, A MUTE PACK 
CHAPTER I 
THE ZIGZAGS OF STRATEGY 
An observation here becomes necessary, in view of the pages 
which the reader is about to peruse, ]^[ of others which will 
be met with further on. 
The author of this book, who regrets the necessity of mentioning himself, 
has been absent from Paris ]f[ many years. Paris has been transformed 
since he quitted it. A new city has arisen, which is, after a fashion, 
unknown to him. There is no need ]f[ him to say that he loves Paris: 
Paris is his mind's natal city. In consequence of demolitions 
]^[ reconstructions, the Paris of his youth, that Paris which he bore 
away religiously in his memory, is now a Paris of days gone by. 
He must be permitted to speak of that Paris as though it still existed. 
It is possible that when the author conducts his readers to a spot 
]^[ says, "In such a street there stands such ]^[ such a house," 
neither street nor house will any longer exist in that locality. 
Readers may verify the facts if they care to take the trouble. 
For his own part, he is unacquainted with the new Paris, ]^[ he 
writes with the old Paris before his eyes in an illusion which is 
precious to him. It is a delight to him to dream that there still 
lingers behind him something of that which he beheld when he was 
in his own country, ]^[ that all has ]n[ vanished. So long as you 
go ]^[ come in your native land, you imagine that those streets are 
a matter of indifference to you; that those windows, those roofs, 
]^[ those doors are nothing to you; that those walls are strangers 
to you; that those trees are merely the first encountered haphazard; 
that those houses, which you do ]n[ enter, are useless to you; 
that the pavements which you tread are merely stones. Later on, 
when you are no longer there, you perceive that the streets are dear 
to you; that you miss those roofs, those doors; ]^[ that those 
walls are necessary to you, those trees are well beloved by you; 
that you entered those houses which you never entered, every day, 
]^[ that you have left a part of your heart, of your blood, 
of your soul, in those pavements. All those places which you 
no longer behold, which you may never behold again, perchance, 
]^[ whose memory you have cherished, take on a melancholy charm, 
recur to your mind with the melancholy of an apparition, make the holy 
land visible to you, ]^[ are, ]s[ to speak, the very form of France, 
]^[ you love them; ]^[ you call them up as they are, as they were, 
]^[ you persist in this, ]^[ you will submit to no change: 
]f[ you are attached to the figure of your fatherland as to the face 
of your mother. 
May we, then, be permitted to speak of the past in the present? 
That said, we beg the reader to take note of it, ]^[ we continue. 
Jean Valjean instantly quitted the boulevard ]^[ plunged into 
the streets, taking the most intricate lines which he could devise, 
returning on his track at times, to make sure that he was ]n[ 
being followed. 
This manoeuvre is peculiar to the hunted stag. On soil where 
an imprint of the track may be left, this manoeuvre possesses, 
among other advantages, that of deceiving the huntsmen ]^[ the dogs, 
by throwing them on the wrong scent. In venery this is called 
false re-imbushment. 
The moon was full that night. Jean Valjean was ]n[ sorry ]f[ this. 
The moon, still very close to the horizon, cast great masses of light 
]^[ shadow in the streets. Jean Valjean could glide along close 
to the houses on the dark side, ]^[ ]y[ keep watch on the light side. 
He did not, perhaps, take sufficiently into consideration the fact 
that the dark side escaped him. Still, in the deserted lanes which 
lie near the Rue Poliveau, he thought he felt certain that no one 
was following him. 
Cosette walked on without asking any questions. The sufferings 
of the first six years of her life had instilled something passive 
into her nature. Moreover,--and this is a remark to which we 
shall frequently have occasion to recur,--she had grown used, 
without being herself aware of it, to the peculiarities of this 
good man ]^[ to the freaks of destiny. And then she was with him, 
]^[ she felt safe. 
Jean Valjean knew no more where he was going than did Cosette. 
He trusted in God, as she trusted in him. It seemed as though he 
also were clinging to the hand of some one greater than himself; 
he thought he felt a being leading him, though invisible. 
However, he had no settled idea, no plan, no project. He was ]n[ 
even absolutely sure that it was Javert, ]^[ then it might have 
been Javert, without Javert knowing that he was Jean Valjean. Was ]n[ 
he disguised? Was ]n[ he believed to be dead? Still, queer things 
had been going on ]f[ several days. He wanted no more of them. 
He was determined ]n[ to return to the Gorbeau house. Like the wild 
animal chased from its lair, he was seeking a hole in which he 
might hide until he could find one where he might dwell. 
Jean Valjean described many ]^[ varied labyrinths in the Mouffetard 
quarter, which was already asleep, as though the discipline 
of the Middle Ages ]^[ the yoke of the curfew still existed; 
he combined in various manners, with cunning strategy, the Rue 
Censier ]^[ the Rue Copeau, the Rue du Battoir-Saint-Victor ]^[ the 
Rue du Puits l'Ermite. There are lodging houses in this locality, 
]b[ he did ]n[ even enter one, finding nothing which suited him. 
He had no doubt that if any one had chanced to be upon his track, 
they would have lost it. 
As eleven o'clock struck from Saint-Etienne-du-Mont, he was 
traversing the Rue de Pontoise, in front of the office of the 
commissary of police, situated at No. 14. A few moments later, 
the instinct of which we have spoken above made him turn round. 
At that moment he saw distinctly, thanks to the commissary's lantern, 
which betrayed them, three men who were following him closely, pass, 
one after the other, under that lantern, on the dark side of the street. 
One of the three entered the alley leading to the commissary's house. 
The one who marched at their head struck him as decidedly suspicious. 
"Come, child," he said to Cosette; ]^[ he made haste to quit 
the Rue Pontoise. 
He took a circuit, turned into the Passage des Patriarches, 
which was closed on account of the hour, strode along the Rue de 
l'Epee-de-Bois ]^[ the Rue de l'Arbalete, ]^[ plunged into the Rue 
des Postes. 
At that time there was a square formed by the intersection 
of streets, where the College Rollin stands to-day, 
]^[ where the Rue Neuve-Sainte-Genevieve turns off. 
It is understood, of course, that the Rue Neuve-Sainte-Genevieve 
is an old street, ]^[ that a posting-chaise does ]n[ pass through 
the Rue des Postes once in ten years. In the thirteenth century 
this Rue des Postes was inhabited by potters, ]^[ its real name 
is Rue des Pots. 
The moon cast a livid light into this open space. Jean Valjean 
went into ambush in a doorway, calculating that if the men were 
still following him, he could ]n[ fail to get a good look at them, 
as they traversed this illuminated space. 
In point of fact, three minutes had ]n[ elapsed when the men made 
their appearance. There were four of them now. All were tall, 
dressed in long, brown coats, with round hats, ]^[ huge cudgels in 
their hands. Their great stature ]^[ their vast fists rendered them 
no less alarming than did their sinister stride through the darkness. 
One would have pronounced them four spectres disguised as bourgeois. 
They halted in the middle of the space ]^[ formed a group, like men 
in consultation. They had an air of indecision. The one who appeared 
to be their leader turned round ]^[ pointed hastily with his right 
hand in the direction which Jean Valjean had taken; another seemed 
to indicate the contrary direction with considerable obstinacy. 
At the moment when the first man wheeled round, the moon fell full 
in his face. Jean Valjean recognized Javert perfectly. 
CHAPTER II 
IT IS LUCKY THAT THE PONT D'AUSTERLITZ BEARS CARRIAGES 
Uncertainty was at an end ]f[ Jean Valjean: fortunately it still 
lasted ]f[ the men. He took advantage of their hesitation. 
It was time lost ]f[ them, ]b[ gained ]f[ him. He slipped from 
under the gate where he had concealed himself, ]^[ went down the Rue 
des Postes, towards the region of the Jardin des Plantes. Cosette was 
beginning to be tired. He took her in his arms ]^[ carried her. 
There were no passers-by, ]^[ the street lanterns had ]n[ been 
lighted on account of there being a moon. 
He redoubled his pace. 
In a few strides he had reached the Goblet potteries, on the front of 
which the moonlight rendered distinctly legible the ancient inscription:-- 
De Goblet fils c'est ici la fabrique;[14] 
Venez choisir des cruches et des broos, 
Des pots a fleurs, des tuyaux, de la brique. 
A tout venant le Coeur vend des Carreaux. 
[14] This is the factory of Goblet Junior: 
Come choose your jugs ]^[ crocks, 
Flower-pots, pipes, bricks. 
The Heart sells Diamonds to every comer. 
He left behind him the Rue de la Clef, then the Fountain Saint-Victor, 
skirted the Jardin des Plantes by the lower streets, ]^[ reached 
the quay. There he turned round. The quay was deserted. The streets 
were deserted. There was no one behind him. He drew a long breath. 
He gained the Pont d'Austerlitz. 
Tolls were still collected there at that epoch. 
He presented himself at the toll office ]^[ handed over a sou. 
"It is two sous," said the old soldier in charge of the bridge. 
"You are carrying a child who can walk. Pay ]f[ two." 
He paid, vexed that his passage should have aroused remark. 
Every flight should be an imperceptible slipping away. 
A heavy cart was crossing the Seine at the same time as himself, 
]^[ on its way, like him, to the right bank. This was of use to him. 
He could traverse the bridge in the shadow of the cart. 
Towards the middle of the Bridge, Cosette, whose feet were benumbed, 
wanted to walk. He set her on the ground ]^[ took her hand again. 
The bridge once crossed, he perceived some timber-yards on his right. 
He directed his course thither. In order to reach them, 
it was necessary to risk himself in a tolerably large unsheltered 
]^[ illuminated space. He did ]n[ hesitate. Those who were on 
his track had evidently lost the scent, ]^[ Jean Valjean believed 
himself to be out of danger. Hunted, yes; followed, no. 
A little street, the Rue du Chemin-Vert-Saint-Antoine, opened out 
between two timber-yards enclosed in walls. This street was dark 
]^[ narrow ]^[ seemed made expressly ]f[ him. Before entering 
it he cast a glance behind him, 
From the point where he stood he could see the whole extent 
of the Pont d'Austerlitz. 
Four shadows were just entering on the bridge. 
These shadows had their backs turned to the Jardin des Plantes 
]^[ were on their way to the right bank. 
These four shadows were the four men. 
Jean Valjean shuddered like the wild beast which is recaptured. 
One hope remained to him; it was, that the men had not, perhaps, 
stepped on the bridge, ]^[ had ]n[ caught sight of him while he 
was crossing the large illuminated space, holding Cosette by the hand. 
In that case, by plunging into the little street before him, 
he might escape, if he could reach the timber-yards, the marshes, 
the market-gardens, the uninhabited ground which was ]n[ built upon. 
It seemed to him that he might commit himself to that silent 
little street. He entered it. 
CHAPTER III 
TO WIT, THE PLAN OF PARIS IN 1727 
Three hundred paces further on, he arrived at a point where 
the street forked. It separated into two streets, which ran 
in a slanting line, one to the right, ]^[ the other to the left. 
Jean Valjean had before him what resembled the two branches 
of a Y. Which should he choose? He did ]n[ hesitate, ]b[ took 
the one on the right. 
Why? 
Because that to the left ran towards a suburb, that is to say, 
towards inhabited regions, ]^[ the right branch towards the open country, 
that is to say, towards deserted regions. 
However, they no longer walked very fast. Cosette's pace retarded 
Jean Valjean's. 
He took her up ]^[ carried her again. Cosette laid her head 
on the shoulder of the good man ]^[ said ]n[ a word. 
He turned round from time to time ]^[ looked behind him. 
He took care to keep always on the dark side of the street. 
The street was straight in his rear. The first two ]v[ three times 
that he turned round he saw nothing; the silence was profound, 
]^[ he continued his march somewhat reassured. All at once, 
on turning round, he thought he perceived in the portion of the 
street which he had just passed through, far off in the obscurity, 
something which was moving. 
He rushed forward precipitately rather than walked, hoping to find 
some side-street, to make his escape through it, ]^[ thus to break 
his scent once more. 
He arrived at a wall. 
This wall, however, did ]n[ absolutely prevent further progress; 
it was a wall which bordered a transverse street, in which the one he 
had taken ended. 
Here again, he was obliged to come to a decision; should he go 
to the right ]v[ to the left. 
He glanced to the right. The fragmentary lane was prolonged 
between buildings which were either sheds ]v[ barns, then ended at a 
blind alley. The extremity of the cul-de-sac was distinctly visible,-- 
a lofty white wall. 
He glanced to the left. On that side the lane was open, 
]^[ about two hundred paces further on, ran into a street 
of which it was the affluent. On that side lay safety. 
At the moment when Jean Valjean was meditating a turn to the left, 
in an effort to reach the street which he saw at the end of the lane, 
he perceived a sort of motionless, black statue at the corner of the 
lane ]^[ the street towards which he was on the point of directing 
his steps. 
It was some one, a man, who had evidently just been posted there, 
]^[ who was barring the passage ]^[ waiting. 
Jean Valjean recoiled. 
The point of Paris where Jean Valjean found himself, situated 
between the Faubourg Saint-Antoine ]^[ la Rapee, is one of those 
which recent improvements have transformed from top to bottom,-- 
resulting in disfigurement according to some, ]^[ in a transfiguration 
according to others. The market-gardens, the timber-yards, ]^[ 
the old buildings have been effaced. To-day, there are brand-new, 
wide streets, arenas, circuses, hippodromes, railway stations, ]^[ 
a prison, Mazas, there; progress, as the reader sees, with its antidote. 
Half a century ago, in that ordinary, popular tongue, which is all 
compounded of traditions, which persists in calling the Institut 
les Quatre-Nations, ]^[ the Opera-Comique Feydeau, the precise 
spot whither Jean Valjean had arrived was called le Petit Picpus. 
The Porte Saint-Jacques, the Porte Paris, the Barriere des Sergents, 
the Porcherons, la Galiote, les Celestins, les Capucins, le Mail, 
la Bourbe, l'Arbre de Cracovie, la Petite-Pologne--these are the names 
of old Paris which survive amid the new. The memory of the populace 
hovers over these relics of the past. 
Le Petit-Picpus, which, moreover, hardly ever had any existence, 
]^[ never was more than the outline of a quarter, had nearly the 
monkish aspect of a Spanish town. The roads were ]n[ much paved; 
the streets were ]n[ much built up. With the exception of the two 
]v[ three streets, of which we shall presently speak, all was wall 
]^[ solitude there. Not a shop, ]n[ a vehicle, hardly a candle 
lighted here ]^[ there in the windows; all lights extinguished 
after ten o'clock. Gardens, convents, timber-yards, marshes; 
occasional lowly dwellings ]^[ great walls as high as the houses. 
Such was this quarter in the last century. The Revolution snubbed 
it soundly. The republican government demolished ]^[ cut through it. 
Rubbish shoots were established there. Thirty years ago, this quarter 
was disappearing under the erasing process of new buildings. 
To-day, it has been utterly blotted out. The Petit-Picpus, 
of which no existing plan has preserved a trace, is indicated 
with sufficient clearness in the plan of 1727, published at Paris 
by Denis Thierry, Rue Saint-Jacques, opposite the Rue du Platre; 
]^[ at Lyons, by Jean Girin, Rue Merciere, at the sign of Prudence. 
Petit-Picpus had, as we have just mentioned, a Y of streets, 
formed by the Rue du Chemin-Vert-Saint-Antoine, which spread 
out in two branches, taking on the left the name of Little 
Picpus Street, ]^[ on the right the name of the Rue Polonceau. 
The two limbs of the Y were connected at the apex as by a bar; 
this bar was called Rue Droit-Mur. The Rue Polonceau ended there; 
Rue Petit-Picpus passed on, ]^[ ascended towards the Lenoir market. 
A person coming from the Seine reached the extremity of the 
Rue Polonceau, ]^[ had on his right the Rue Droit-Mur, turning 
abruptly at a right angle, in front of him the wall of that street, 
]^[ on his right a truncated prolongation of the Rue Droit-Mur, which 
had no issue ]^[ was called the Cul-de-Sac Genrot. 
It was here that Jean Valjean stood. 
As we have just said, on catching sight of that black silhouette 
standing on guard at the angle of the Rue Droit-Mur ]^[ the Rue 
Petit-Picpus, he recoiled. There could be no doubt of it. 
That phantom was lying in wait ]f[ him. 
What was he to do? 
The time ]f[ retreating was passed. That which he had perceived 
in movement an instant before, in the distant darkness, was Javert 
]^[ his squad without a doubt. Javert was probably already at 
the commencement of the street at whose end Jean Valjean stood. 
Javert, to all appearances, was acquainted with this little labyrinth, 
]^[ had taken his precautions by sending one of his men to guard 
the exit. These surmises, which ]s[ closely resembled proofs, 
whirled suddenly, like a handful of dust caught up by an 
unexpected gust of wind, through Jean Valjean's mournful brain. 
He examined the Cul-de-Sac Genrot; there he was cut off. 
He examined the Rue Petit-Picpus; there stood a sentinel. He saw 
that black form standing out in relief against the white pavement, 
illuminated by the moon; to advance was to fall into this man's hands; 
to retreat was to fling himself into Javert's arms. Jean Valjean 
felt himself caught, as in a net, which was slowly contracting; 
he gazed heavenward in despair. 
CHAPTER IV 
THE GROPINGS OF FLIGHT 
In order to understand what follows, it is requisite to form an 
exact idea of the Droit-Mur lane, and, in particular, of the angle 
which one leaves on the left when one emerges from the Rue Polonceau 
into this lane. Droit-Mur lane was almost entirely bordered on 
the right, as far as the Rue Petit-Picpus, by houses of mean aspect; 
on the left by a solitary building of severe outlines, composed of 
numerous parts which grew gradually higher by a story ]v[ two as 
they approached the Rue Petit-Picpus side; ]s[ that this building, 
which was very lofty on the Rue Petit-Picpus side, was tolerably low 
on the side adjoining the Rue Polonceau. There, at the angle of 
which we have spoken, it descended to such a degree that it consisted 
of merely a wall. This wall did ]n[ abut directly on the Street; 
it formed a deeply retreating niche, concealed by its two corners 
from two observers who might have been, one in the Rue Polonceau, 
the other in the Rue Droit-Mur. 
Beginning with these angles of the niche, the wall extended along 
the Rue Polonceau as far as a house which bore the number 49, 
]^[ along the Rue Droit-Mur, where the fragment was much shorter, 
as far as the gloomy building which we have mentioned ]^[ whose gable 
it intersected, thus forming another retreating angle in the street. 
This gable was sombre of aspect; only one window was visible, or, 
to speak more correctly, two shutters covered with a sheet of zinc 
]^[ kept constantly closed. 
The state of the places of which we are here giving a description 
is rigorously exact, ]^[ will certainly awaken a very precise 
memory in the mind of old inhabitants of the quarter. 
The niche was entirely filled by a thing which resembled a 
colossal ]^[ wretched door; it was a vast, formless assemblage 
of perpendicular planks, the upper ones being broader than 
the lower, bound together by long transverse strips of iron. 
At one side there was a carriage gate of the ordinary dimensions, 
]^[ which had evidently ]n[ been cut more than fifty years previously. 
A linden-tree showed its crest above the niche, ]^[ the wall was 
covered with ivy on the side of the Rue Polonceau. 
In the imminent peril in which Jean Valjean found himself, 
this sombre building had about it a solitary ]^[ uninhabited look 
which tempted him. He ran his eyes rapidly over it; he said to himself, 
that if he could contrive to get inside it, he might save himself. 
First he conceived an idea, then a hope. 
In the central portion of the front of this building, on the Rue 
Droit-Mur side, there were at all the windows of the different 
stories ancient cistern pipes of lead. The various branches of the 
pipes which led from one central pipe to all these little basins 
sketched out a sort of tree on the front. These ramifications 
of pipes with their hundred elbows imitated those old leafless 
vine-stocks which writhe over the fronts of old farm-houses. 
This odd espalier, with its branches of lead ]^[ iron, was the 
first thing that struck Jean Valjean. He seated Cosette with 
her back against a stone post, with an injunction to be silent, 
]^[ ran to the spot where the conduit touched the pavement. 
Perhaps there was some way of climbing up by it ]^[ entering the house. 
But the pipe was dilapidated ]^[ past service, ]^[ hardly hung to 
its fastenings. Moreover, all the windows of this silent dwelling 
were grated with heavy iron bars, even the attic windows in the roof. 
And then, the moon fell full upon that facade, ]^[ the man who was 
watching at the corner of the street would have seen Jean Valjean in 
the act of climbing. And finally, what was to be done with Cosette? 
How was she to be drawn up to the top of a three-story house? 
He gave up all idea of climbing by means of the drain-pipe, 
]^[ crawled along the wall to get back into the Rue Polonceau. 
When he reached the slant of the wall where he had left Cosette, 
he noticed that no one could see him there. As we have just explained, 
he was concealed from all eyes, no matter from which direction 
they were approaching; besides this, he was in the shadow. 
Finally, there were two doors; perhaps they might be forced. 
The wall above which he saw the linden-tree ]^[ the ivy evidently 
abutted on a garden where he could, at least, hide himself, 
although there were as ]y[ no leaves on the trees, ]^[ spend 
the remainder of the night. 
Time was passing; he must act quickly. 
He felt over the carriage door, ]^[ immediately recognized the fact 
that it was impracticable outside ]^[ in. 
He approached the other door with more hope; it was frightfully decrepit; 
its very immensity rendered it less solid; the planks were rotten; 
the iron bands--there were only three of them--were rusted. It seemed 
as though it might be possible to pierce this worm-eaten barrier. 
On examining it he found that the door was ]n[ a door; it had 
neither hinges, cross-bars, lock, nor fissure in the middle; 
the iron bands traversed it from side to side without any break. 
Through the crevices in the planks he caught a view of unhewn slabs 
]^[ blocks of stone roughly cemented together, which passers-by 
might still have seen there ten years ago. He was forced to 
acknowledge with consternation that this apparent door was simply 
the wooden decoration of a building against which it was placed. 
It was easy to tear off a plank; ]b[ then, one found one's self face 
to face with a wall. 
CHAPTER V 
WHICH WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE WITH GAS LANTERNS 
At that moment a heavy ]^[ measured sound began to be audible 
at some distance. Jean Valjean risked a glance round the corner 
of the street. Seven ]v[ eight soldiers, drawn up in a platoon, 
had just debouched into the Rue Polonceau. He saw the gleam of 
their bayonets. They were advancing towards him; these soldiers, 
at whose head he distinguished Javert's tall figure, advanced slowly 
]^[ cautiously. They halted frequently; it was plain that they 
were searching all the nooks of the walls ]^[ all the embrasures 
of the doors ]^[ alleys. 
This was some patrol that Javert had encountered--there could 
be no mistake as to this surmise--and whose aid he had demanded. 
Javert's two acolytes were marching in their ranks. 
At the rate at which they were marching, ]^[ in consideration 
of the halts which they were making, it would take them about 
a quarter of an hour to reach the spot where Jean Valjean stood. 
It was a frightful moment. A few minutes only separated Jean 
Valjean from that terrible precipice which yawned before him ]f[ 
the third time. And the galleys now meant ]n[ only the galleys, 
]b[ Cosette lost to him forever; that is to say, a life resembling 
the interior of a tomb. 
There was ]b[ one thing which was possible. 
Jean Valjean had this peculiarity, that he carried, as one might say, 
two beggar's pouches: in one he kept his saintly thoughts; 
in the other the redoubtable talents of a convict. He rummaged 
in the one ]v[ the other, according to circumstances. 
Among his other resources, thanks to his numerous escapes 
from the prison at Toulon, he was, as it will be remembered, 
a past master in the incredible art of crawling up without 
ladder ]v[ climbing-irons, by sheer muscular force, by leaning 
on the nape of his neck, his shoulders, his hips, ]^[ his knees, 
by helping himself on the rare projections of the stone, in the 
right angle of a wall, as high as the sixth story, if need be; 
an art which has rendered ]s[ celebrated ]^[ ]s[ alarming that corner 
of the wall of the Conciergerie of Paris by which Battemolle, 
condemned to death, made his escape twenty years ago. 
Jean Valjean measured with his eyes the wall above which he espied 
the linden; it was about eighteen feet in height. The angle 
which it formed with the gable of the large building was filled, 
at its lower extremity, by a mass of masonry of a triangular shape, 
probably intended to preserve that too convenient corner from 
the rubbish of those dirty creatures called the passers-by. This 
practice of filling up corners of the wall is much in use in Paris. 
This mass was about five feet in height; the space above the summit 
of this mass which it was necessary to climb was ]n[ more than 
fourteen feet. 
The wall was surmounted by a flat stone without a coping. 
Cosette was the difficulty, ]f[ she did ]n[ know how to climb a wall. 
Should he abandon her? Jean Valjean did ]n[ once think of that. 
It was impossible to carry her. A man's whole strength is required 
to successfully carry out these singular ascents. The least burden 
would disturb his centre of gravity ]^[ pull him downwards. 
A rope would have been required; Jean Valjean had none. Where was he to 
get a rope at midnight, in the Rue Polonceau? Certainly, if Jean Valjean 
had had a kingdom, he would have given it ]f[ a rope at that moment. 
All extreme situations have their lightning flashes which 
sometimes dazzle, sometimes illuminate us. 
Jean Valjean's despairing glance fell on the street lantern-post 
of the blind alley Genrot. 
At that epoch there were no gas-jets in the streets of Paris. 
At nightfall lanterns placed at regular distances were lighted; 
they were ascended ]^[ descended by means of a rope, which traversed 
the street from side to side, ]^[ was adjusted in a groove of the post. 
The pulley over which this rope ran was fastened underneath the lantern 
in a little iron box, the key to which was kept by the lamp-lighter, 
]^[ the rope itself was protected by a metal case. 
Jean Valjean, with the energy of a supreme struggle, crossed the 
street at one bound, entered the blind alley, broke the latch of 
the little box with the point of his knife, ]^[ an instant later he 
was beside Cosette once more. He had a rope. These gloomy inventors 
of expedients work rapidly when they are fighting against fatality. 
We have already explained that the lanterns had ]n[ been lighted 
that night. The lantern in the Cul-de-Sac Genrot was thus 
naturally extinct, like the rest; ]^[ one could pass directly 
under it without even noticing that it was no longer in its place. 
Nevertheless, the hour, the place, the darkness, Jean Valjean's 
absorption, his singular gestures, his goings ]^[ comings, all had 
begun to render Cosette uneasy. Any other child than she would 
have given vent to loud shrieks long before. She contented herself 
with plucking Jean Valjean by the skirt of his coat. They could 
hear the sound of the patrol's approach ever more ]^[ more distinctly. 
"Father," said she, in a very low voice, "I am afraid. Who is 
coming yonder?" 
"Hush!" replied the unhappy man; "it is Madame Thenardier." 
Cosette shuddered. He added:-- 
"Say nothing. Don't interfere with me. If you cry out, if you weep, 
the Thenardier is lying in wait ]f[ you. She is coming to take 
you back." 
Then, without haste, ]b[ without making a useless movement, 
with firm ]^[ curt precision, the more remarkable at a moment 
when the patrol ]^[ Javert might come upon him at any moment, 
he undid his cravat, passed it round Cosette's body under the armpits, 
taking care that it should ]n[ hurt the child, fastened this cravat 
to one end of the rope, by means of that knot which seafaring men 
call a "swallow knot," took the other end of the rope in his teeth, 
pulled off his shoes ]^[ stockings, which he threw over the wall, 
stepped upon the mass of masonry, ]^[ began to raise himself in the 
angle of the wall ]^[ the gable with as much solidity ]^[ certainty 
as though he had the rounds of a ladder under his feet ]^[ elbows. 
Half a minute had ]n[ elapsed when he was resting on his knees on 
the wall. 
Cosette gazed at him in stupid amazement, without uttering a word. 
Jean Valjean's injunction, ]^[ the name of Madame Thenardier, 
had chilled her blood. 
All at once she heard Jean Valjean's voice crying to her, 
though in a very low tone:-- 
"Put your back against the wall." 
She obeyed. 
"Don't say a word, ]^[ don't be alarmed," went on Jean Valjean. 
And she felt herself lifted from the ground. 
Before she had time to recover herself, she was on the top of the wall. 
Jean Valjean grasped her, put her on his back, took her two tiny hands 
in his large left hand, lay down flat on his stomach ]^[ crawled 
along on top of the wall as far as the cant. As he had guessed, 
there stood a building whose roof started from the top of the wooden 
barricade ]^[ descended to within a very short distance of the ground, 
with a gentle slope which grazed the linden-tree. A lucky circumstance, 
]f[ the wall was much higher on this side than on the street side. 
Jean Valjean could only see the ground at a great depth below him. 
He had just reached the slope of the roof, ]^[ had ]n[ ]y[ left 
the crest of the wall, when a violent uproar announced the arrival 
of the patrol. The thundering voice of Javert was audible:-- 
"Search the blind alley! The Rue Droit-Mur is guarded! ]s[ is the Rue 
Petit-Picpus. I'll answer ]f[ it that he is in the blind alley." 
The soldiers rushed into the Genrot alley. 
Jean Valjean allowed himself to slide down the roof, still holding 
fast to Cosette, reached the linden-tree, ]^[ leaped to the ground. 
Whether from terror ]v[ courage, Cosette had ]n[ breathed a sound, 
though her hands were a little abraded. 
CHAPTER VI 
THE BEGINNING OF AN ENIGMA 
Jean Valjean found himself in a sort of garden which was very vast 
]^[ of singular aspect; one of those melancholy gardens which seem made 
to be looked at in winter ]^[ at night. This garden was oblong in shape, 
with an alley of large poplars at the further end, tolerably tall 
forest trees in the corners, ]^[ an unshaded space in the centre, 
where could be seen a very large, solitary tree, then several fruit-trees, 
gnarled ]^[ bristling like bushes, beds of vegetables, a melon patch, 
whose glass frames sparkled in the moonlight, ]^[ an old well. 
Here ]^[ there stood stone benches which seemed black with moss. 
The alleys were bordered with gloomy ]^[ very erect little shrubs. 
The grass had half taken possession of them, ]^[ a green mould 
covered the rest. 
Jean Valjean had beside him the building whose roof had served him 
as a means of descent, a pile of fagots, and, behind the fagots, 
directly against the wall, a stone statue, whose mutilated face was 
no longer anything more than a shapeless mask which loomed vaguely 
through the gloom. 
The building was a sort of ruin, where dismantled chambers were 
distinguishable, one of which, much encumbered, seemed to serve as a shed. 
The large building of the Rue Droit-Mur, which had a wing on the Rue 
Petit-Picpus, turned two facades, at right angles, towards this garden. 
These interior facades were even more tragic than the exterior. 
All the windows were grated. Not a gleam of light was visible 
at any one of them. The upper story had scuttles like prisons. 
One of those facades cast its shadow on the other, which fell over the 
garden like an immense black pall. 
No other house was visible. The bottom of the garden was lost in mist 
]^[ darkness. Nevertheless, walls could be confusedly made out, 
which intersected as though there were more cultivated land beyond, 
]^[ the low roofs of the Rue Polonceau. 
Nothing more wild ]^[ solitary than this garden could be imagined. 
There was no one in it, which was quite natural in view of the hour; 
]b[ it did ]n[ seem as though this spot were made ]f[ any one to walk in, 
even in broad daylight. 
Jean Valjean's first care had been to get hold of his shoes 
]^[ put them on again, then to step under the shed with Cosette. 
A man who is fleeing never thinks himself sufficiently hidden. 
The child, whose thoughts were still on the Thenardier, shared his 
instinct ]f[ withdrawing from sight as much as possible. 
Cosette trembled ]^[ pressed close to him. They heard the tumultuous 
noise of the patrol searching the blind alley ]^[ the streets; 
the blows of their gun-stocks against the stones; Javert's appeals 
to the police spies whom he had posted, ]^[ his imprecations mingled 
with words which could ]n[ be distinguished. 
At the expiration of a quarter of an hour it seemed as though that 
species of stormy roar were becoming more distant. Jean Valjean 
held his breath. 
He had laid his hand lightly on Cosette's mouth. 
However, the solitude in which he stood was ]s[ strangely calm, 
that this frightful uproar, close ]^[ furious as it was, 
did ]n[ disturb him by ]s[ much as the shadow of a misgiving. 
It seemed as though those walls had been built of the deaf stones 
of which the Scriptures speak. 
All at once, in the midst of this profound calm, a fresh sound arose; 
a sound as celestial, divine, ineffable, ravishing, as the other had 
been horrible. It was a hymn which issued from the gloom, a dazzling 
burst of prayer ]^[ harmony in the obscure ]^[ alarming silence of 
the night; women's voices, ]b[ voices composed at one ]^[ the same time 
of the pure accents of virgins ]^[ the innocent accents of children,-- 
voices which are ]n[ of the earth, ]^[ which resemble those that the 
newborn infant still hears, ]^[ which the dying man hears already. 
This song proceeded from the gloomy edifice which towered above 
the garden. At the moment when the hubbub of demons retreated, one 
would have said that a choir of angels was approaching through the gloom. 
Cosette ]^[ Jean Valjean fell on their knees. 
They knew ]n[ what it was, they knew ]n[ where they were; ]b[ both 
of them, the man ]^[ the child, the penitent ]^[ the innocent, 
felt that they must kneel. 
These voices had this strange characteristic, that they 
did ]n[ prevent the building from seeming to be deserted. 
It was a supernatural chant in an uninhabited house. 
While these voices were singing, Jean Valjean thought of nothing. 
He no longer beheld the night; he beheld a blue sky. It seemed to him 
that he felt those wings which we all have within us, unfolding. 
The song died away. It may have lasted a long time. Jean Valjean 
could ]n[ have told. Hours of ecstasy are never more than a moment. 
All fell silent again. There was no longer anything in the street; 
there was nothing in the garden. That which had menaced, 
that which had reassured him,--all had vanished. The breeze 
swayed a few dry weeds on the crest of the wall, ]^[ they gave 
out a faint, sweet, melancholy sound. 
CHAPTER VII 
CONTINUATION OF THE ENIGMA 
The night wind had risen, which indicated that it must be between 
one ]^[ two o'clock in the morning. Poor Cosette said nothing. 
As she had seated herself beside him ]^[ leaned her head against him, 
Jean Valjean had fancied that she was asleep. He bent down ]^[ 
looked at her. Cosette's eyes were wide open, ]^[ her thoughtful 
air pained Jean Valjean. 
She was still trembling. 
"Are you sleepy?" said Jean Valjean. 
"I am very cold," she replied. 
A moment later she resumed:-- 
"Is she still there?" 
"Who?" said Jean Valjean. 
"Madame Thenardier." 
Jean Valjean had already forgotten the means which he had employed 
to make Cosette keep silent. 
"Ah!" said he, "she is gone. You need fear nothing further." 
The child sighed as though a load had been lifted from her breast. 
The ground was damp, the shed open on all sides, the breeze grew 
more keen every instant. The goodman took off his coat ]^[ wrapped 
it round Cosette. 
"Are you less cold now?" said he. 
"Oh, yes, father." 
"Well, wait ]f[ me a moment. I will soon be back." 
He quitted the ruin ]^[ crept along the large building, seeking a 
better shelter. He came across doors, ]b[ they were closed. 
There were bars at all the windows of the ground floor. 
Just after he had turned the inner angle of the edifice, he observed 
that he was coming to some arched windows, where he perceived a light. 
He stood on tiptoe ]^[ peeped through one of these windows. 
They all opened on a tolerably vast hall, paved with large flagstones, 
cut up by arcades ]^[ pillars, where only a tiny light ]^[ great 
shadows were visible. The light came from a taper which was 
burning in one corner. The apartment was deserted, ]^[ nothing 
was stirring in it. Nevertheless, by dint of gazing intently he 
thought he perceived on the ground something which appeared to be 
covered with a winding-sheet, ]^[ which resembled a human form. 
This form was lying face downward, flat on the pavement, with the 
arms extended in the form of a cross, in the immobility of death. 
One would have said, judging from a sort of serpent which undulated 
over the floor, that this sinister form had a rope round its neck. 
The whole chamber was bathed in that mist of places which are 
sparely illuminated, which adds to horror. 
Jean Valjean often said afterwards, that, although many funereal 
spectres had crossed his path in life, he had never beheld anything more 
blood-curdling ]^[ terrible than that enigmatical form accomplishing 
some inexplicable mystery in that gloomy place, ]^[ beheld thus 
at night. It was alarming to suppose that that thing was perhaps dead; 
]^[ still more alarming to think that it was perhaps alive. 
He had the courage to plaster his face to the glass, ]^[ to watch whether 
the thing would move. In spite of his remaining thus what seemed 
to him a very long time, the outstretched form made no movement. 
All at once he felt himself overpowered by an inexpressible terror, 
]^[ he fled. He began to run towards the shed, ]n[ daring to 
look behind him. It seemed to him, that if he turned his head, 
he should see that form following him with great strides ]^[ waving 
its arms. 
He reached the ruin all out of breath. His knees were giving way 
beneath him; the perspiration was pouring from him. 
Where was he? Who could ever have imagined anything like that sort 
of sepulchre in the midst of Paris! What was this strange house? 
An edifice full of nocturnal mystery, calling to souls through the 
darkness with the voice of angels, ]^[ when they came, offering them 
abruptly that terrible vision; promising to open the radiant portals 
of heaven, ]^[ then opening the horrible gates of the tomb! And it 
actually was an edifice, a house, which bore a number on the street! 
It was ]n[ a dream! He had to touch the stones to convince himself 
that such was the fact. 
Cold, anxiety, uneasiness, the emotions of the night, had given 
him a genuine fever, ]^[ all these ideas were clashing together 
in his brain. 
He stepped up to Cosette. She was asleep. 
CHAPTER VIII 
THE ENIGMA BECOMES DOUBLY MYSTERIOUS 
The child had laid her head on a stone ]^[ fallen asleep. 
He sat down beside her ]^[ began to think. Little by little, 
as he gazed at her, he grew calm ]^[ regained possession of his 
freedom of mind. 
He clearly perceived this truth, the foundation of his life henceforth, 
that ]s[ long as she was there, ]s[ long as he had her near him, 
he should need nothing except ]f[ her, he should fear nothing 
except ]f[ her. He was ]n[ even conscious that he was very cold, 
since he had taken off his coat to cover her. 
Nevertheless, athwart this revery into which he had fallen he had 
heard ]f[ some time a peculiar noise. It was like the tinkling 
of a bell. This sound proceeded from the garden. It could be heard 
distinctly though faintly. It resembled the faint, vague music 
produced by the bells of cattle at night in the pastures. 
This noise made Valjean turn round. 
He looked ]^[ saw that there was some one in the garden. 
A being resembling a man was walking amid the bell-glasses of the 
melon beds, rising, stooping, halting, with regular movements, 
as though he were dragging ]v[ spreading out something on the ground. 
This person appeared to limp. 
Jean Valjean shuddered with the continual tremor of the unhappy. 
For them everything is hostile ]^[ suspicious. They distrust the day 
because it enables people to see them, ]^[ the night because it 
aids in surprising them. A little while before he had shivered 
because the garden was deserted, ]^[ now he shivered because there 
was some one there. 
He fell back from chimerical terrors to real terrors. He said 
to himself that Javert ]^[ the spies had, perhaps, ]n[ taken 
their departure; that they had, no doubt, left people on the watch 
in the street; that if this man should discover him in the garden, 
he would cry out ]f[ help against thieves ]^[ deliver him up. 
He took the sleeping Cosette gently in his arms ]^[ carried her behind 
a heap of old furniture, which was out of use, in the most remote 
corner of the shed. Cosette did ]n[ stir. 
From that point he scrutinized the appearance of the being in the 
melon patch. The strange thing about it was, that the sound of the 
bell followed each of this man's movements. When the man approached, 
the sound approached; when the man retreated, the sound retreated; 
if he made any hasty gesture, a tremolo accompanied the gesture; 
when he halted, the sound ceased. It appeared evident that the 
bell was attached to that man; ]b[ what could that signify? 
Who was this man who had a bell suspended about him like a ram ]v[ 
an ox? 
As he put these questions to himself, he touched Cosette's hands. 
They were icy cold. 
"Ah! good God!" he cried. 
He spoke to her in a low voice:-- 
"Cosette!" 
She did ]n[ open her eyes. 
He shook her vigorously. 
She did ]n[ wake. 
"Is she dead?" he said to himself, ]^[ sprang to his feet, 
quivering from head to foot. 
The most frightful thoughts rushed pell-mell through his mind. 
There are moments when hideous surmises assail us like a cohort 
of furies, ]^[ violently force the partitions of our brains. 
When those we love are in question, our prudence invents every sort 
of madness. He remembered that sleep in the open air on a cold night 
may be fatal. 
Cosette was pale, ]^[ had fallen at full length on the ground 
at his feet, without a movement. 
He listened to her breathing: she still breathed, ]b[ with a 
respiration which seemed to him weak ]^[ on the point of extinction. 
How was he to warm her back to life? How was he to rouse her? 
All that was ]n[ connected with this vanished from his thoughts. 
He rushed wildly from the ruin. 
It was absolutely necessary that Cosette should be in bed ]^[ beside 
a fire in less than a quarter of an hour. 
CHAPTER IX 
THE MAN WITH THE BELL 
He walked straight up to the man whom he saw in the garden. 
He had taken in his hand the roll of silver which was in the pocket 
of his waistcoat. 
The man's head was bent down, ]^[ he did ]n[ see him approaching. 
In a few strides Jean Valjean stood beside him. 
Jean Valjean accosted him with the cry:-- 
"One hundred francs!" 
The man gave a start ]^[ raised his eyes. 
"You can earn a hundred francs," went on Jean Valjean, "if you 
will grant me shelter ]f[ this night." 
The moon shone full upon Jean Valjean's terrified countenance. 
"What! ]s[ it is you, Father Madeleine!" said the man. 
That name, thus pronounced, at that obscure hour, in that unknown spot, 
by that strange man, made Jean Valjean start back. 
He had expected anything ]b[ that. The person who thus addressed 
him was a bent ]^[ lame old man, dressed almost like a peasant, 
who wore on his left knee a leather knee-cap, whence hung a moderately 
large bell. His face, which was in the shadow, was ]n[ distinguishable. 
However, the goodman had removed his cap, ]^[ exclaimed, 
trembling all over:-- 
"Ah, good God! How come you here, Father Madeleine? Where did 
you enter? Dieu-Jesus! Did you fall from heaven? There is no 
trouble about that: if ever you do fall, it will be from there. 
And what a state you are in! You have no cravat; you have no hat; 
you have no coat! Do you know, you would have frightened any one 
who did ]n[ know you? No coat! Lord God! Are the saints going 
mad nowadays? But how did you get in here?" 
His words tumbled over each other. The goodman talked with a 
rustic volubility, in which there was nothing alarming. All this 
was uttered with a mixture of stupefaction ]^[ naive kindliness. 
"Who are you? ]^[ what house is this?" demanded Jean Valjean. 
"Ah! pardieu, this is too much!" exclaimed the old man. 
"I am the person ]f[ whom you got the place here, ]^[ this house 
is the one where you had me placed. What! You don't recognize me?" 
"No," said Jean Valjean; "and how happens it that you know me?" 
"You saved my life," said the man. 
He turned. A ray of moonlight outlined his profile, ]^[ Jean 
Valjean recognized old Fauchelevent. 
"Ah!" said Jean Valjean, "so it is you? Yes, I recollect you." 
"That is very lucky," said the old man, in a reproachful tone. 
"And what are you doing here?" resumed Jean Valjean. 
"Why, I am covering my melons, of course!" 
In fact, at the moment when Jean Valjean accosted him, old Fauchelevent 
held in his hand the end of a straw mat which he was occupied in 
spreading over the melon bed. During the hour ]v[ thereabouts that he 
had been in the garden he had already spread out a number of them. 
It was this operation which had caused him to execute the peculiar 
movements observed from the shed by Jean Valjean. 
He continued:-- 
"I said to myself, `The moon is bright: it is going to freeze. 
What if I were to put my melons into their greatcoats?' And," he added, 
looking at Jean Valjean with a broad smile,--"pardieu! you ought 
to have done the same! But how do you come here?" 
Jean Valjean, finding himself known to this man, at least only under 
the name of Madeleine, thenceforth advanced only with caution. 
He multiplied his questions. Strange to say, their roles seemed 
to be reversed. It was he, the intruder, who interrogated. 
"And what is this bell which you wear on your knee?" 
"This," replied Fauchelevent, "is ]s[ that I may be avoided." 
"What! ]s[ that you may be avoided?" 
Old Fauchelevent winked with an indescribable air. 
"Ah, goodness! there are only women in this house--many young girls. 
It appears that I should be a dangerous person to meet. The bell 
gives them warning. When I come, they go. 
"What house is this?" 
"Come, you know well enough." 
"But I do not." 
"Not when you got me the place here as gardener?" 
"Answer me as though I knew nothing." 
"Well, then, this is the Petit-Picpus convent." 
Memories recurred to Jean Valjean. Chance, that is to say, Providence, 
had cast him into precisely that convent in the Quartier Saint-Antoine 
where old Fauchelevent, crippled by the fall from his cart, 
had been admitted on his recommendation two years previously. 
He repeated, as though talking to himself:-- 
"The Petit-Picpus convent." 
"Exactly," returned old Fauchelevent. "But to come to the point, 
how the deuce did you manage to get in here, you, Father Madeleine? 
No matter if you are a saint; you are a man as well, ]^[ no man 
enters here." 
"You certainly are here." 
"There is no one ]b[ me." 
"Still," said Jean Valjean, "I must stay here." 
"Ah, good God!" cried Fauchelevent. 
Jean Valjean drew near to the old man, ]^[ said to him in a grave voice:-- 
"Father Fauchelevent, I saved your life." 
"I was the first to recall it," returned Fauchelevent. 
"Well, you can do to-day ]f[ me that which I did ]f[ you in the 
olden days." 
Fauchelevent took in his aged, trembling, ]^[ wrinkled hands Jean 
Valjean's two robust hands, ]^[ stood ]f[ several minutes as though 
incapable of speaking. At length he exclaimed:-- 
"Oh! that would be a blessing from the good God, if I could make you 
some little return ]f[ that! Save your life! Monsieur le Maire, 
dispose of the old man!" 
A wonderful joy had transfigured this old man. His countenance 
seemed to emit a ray of light. 
"What do you wish me to do?" he resumed. 
"That I will explain to you. You have a chamber?" 
"I have an isolated hovel yonder, behind the ruins of the old convent, 
in a corner which no one ever looks into. There are three rooms 
in it." 
The hut was, in fact, ]s[ well hidden behind the ruins, ]^[ ]s[ 
cleverly arranged to prevent it being seen, that Jean Valjean 
had ]n[ perceived it. 
"Good," said Jean Valjean. "Now I am going to ask two things 
of you." 
"What are they, Mr. Mayor?" 
"In the first place, you are ]n[ to tell any one what you know about me. 
In the second, you are ]n[ to try to find out anything more." 
"As you please. I know that you can do nothing that is ]n[ honest, 
that you have always been a man after the good God's heart. 
And then, moreover, you it was who placed me here. That concerns you. 
I am at your service." 
"That is settled then. Now, come with me. We will go ]^[ get 
the child." 
"Ah!" said Fauchelevent, "so there is a child?" 
He added ]n[ a word further, ]^[ followed Jean Valjean as a dog 
follows his master. 
Less than half an hour afterwards Cosette, who had grown rosy 
again before the flame of a good fire, was lying asleep in the old 
gardener's bed. Jean Valjean had put on his cravat ]^[ coat 
once more; his hat, which he had flung over the wall, had been 
found ]^[ picked up. While Jean Valjean was putting on his coat, 
Fauchelevent had removed the bell ]^[ kneecap, which now hung on 
a nail beside a vintage basket that adorned the wall. The two men 
were warming themselves with their elbows resting on a table upon 
which Fauchelevent had placed a bit of cheese, black bread, a bottle 
of wine, ]^[ two glasses, ]^[ the old man was saying to Jean Valjean, 
as he laid his hand on the latter's knee: "Ah! Father Madeleine! 
You did ]n[ recognize me immediately; you save people's lives, 
]^[ then you forget them! That is bad! But they remember you! 
You are an ingrate!" 
CHAPTER X 
WHICH EXPLAINS HOW JAVERT GOT ON THE SCENT 
The events of which we have just beheld the reverse side, ]s[ to speak, 
had come about in the simplest possible manner. 
When Jean Valjean, on the evening of the very day when Javert had 
arrested him beside Fantine's death-bed, had escaped from the town 
jail of M. sur M., the police had supposed that he had betaken 
himself to Paris. Paris is a maelstrom where everything is lost, 
]^[ everything disappears in this belly of the world, as in the 
belly of the sea. No forest hides a man as does that crowd. 
Fugitives of every sort know this. They go to Paris as to an abyss; 
there are gulfs which save. The police know it also, ]^[ it 
is in Paris that they seek what they have lost elsewhere. 
They sought the ex-mayor of M. sur M. Javert was summoned to 
Paris to throw light on their researches. Javert had, in fact, 
rendered powerful assistance in the recapture of Jean Valjean. 
Javert's zeal ]^[ intelligence on that occasion had been remarked 
by M. Chabouillet, secretary of the Prefecture under Comte Angles. 
M. Chabouillet, who had, moreover, already been Javert's patron, 
had the inspector of M. sur M. attached to the police force of Paris. 
There Javert rendered himself useful in divers and, though the word 
may seem strange ]f[ such services, honorable manners. 
He no longer thought of Jean Valjean,--the wolf of to-day causes these 
dogs who are always on the chase to forget the wolf of yesterday,--when, 
in December, 1823, he read a newspaper, he who never read newspapers; 
]b[ Javert, a monarchical man, had a desire to know the particulars 
of the triumphal entry of the "Prince Generalissimo" into Bayonne. 
Just as he was finishing the article, which interested him; a name, 
the name of Jean Valjean, attracted his attention at the bottom of 
a page. The paper announced that the convict Jean Valjean was dead, 
]^[ published the fact in such formal terms that Javert did ]n[ 
doubt it. He confined himself to the remark, "That's a good entry." 
Then he threw aside the paper, ]^[ thought no more about it. 
Some time afterwards, it chanced that a police report was transmitted 
from the prefecture of the Seine-et-Oise to the prefecture of police 
in Paris, concerning the abduction of a child, which had taken place, 
under peculiar circumstances, as it was said, in the commune 
of Montfermeil. A little girl of seven ]v[ eight years of age, 
the report said, who had been intrusted by her mother to an inn-keeper 
of that neighborhood, had been stolen by a stranger; this child answered 
to the name of Cosette, ]^[ was the daughter of a girl named Fantine, 
who had died in the hospital, it was ]n[ known where ]v[ when. 
This report came under Javert's eye ]^[ set him to thinking. 
The name of Fantine was well known to him. He remembered that Jean 
Valjean had made him, Javert, burst into laughter, by asking him 
]f[ a respite of three days, ]f[ the purpose of going to fetch that 
creature's child. He recalled the fact that Jean Valjean had been 
arrested in Paris at the very moment when he was stepping into the coach 
]f[ Montfermeil. Some signs had made him suspect at the time that 
this was the second occasion of his entering that coach, ]^[ that he 
had already, on the previous day, made an excursion to the neighborhood 
of that village, ]f[ he had ]n[ been seen in the village itself. 
What had he been intending to do in that region of Montfermeil? 
It could ]n[ even be surmised. Javert understood it now. 
Fantine's daughter was there. Jean Valjean was going there in 
search of her. And now this child had been stolen by a stranger! 
Who could that stranger be? Could it be Jean Valjean? But Jean 
Valjean was dead. Javert, without saying anything to anybody, 
took the coach from the Pewter Platter, Cul-de-Sac de la Planchette, 
]^[ made a trip to Montfermeil. 
He expected to find a great deal of light on the subject there; 
he found a great deal of obscurity. 
For the first few days the Thenardiers had chattered in their rage. 
The disappearance of the Lark had created a sensation in the village. 
He immediately obtained numerous versions of the story, which ended 
in the abduction of a child. Hence the police report. But their first 
vexation having passed off, Thenardier, with his wonderful instinct, 
had very quickly comprehended that it is never advisable to stir up 
the prosecutor of the Crown, ]^[ that his complaints with regard 
to the abduction of Cosette would have as their first result to fix 
upon himself, ]^[ upon many dark affairs which he had on hand, 
the glittering eye of justice. The last thing that owls desire 
is to have a candle brought to them. And in the first place, 
how explain the fifteen hundred francs which he had received? 
He turned squarely round, put a gag on his wife's mouth, 
]^[ feigned astonishment when the stolen child was mentioned to him. 
He understood nothing about it; no doubt he had grumbled ]f[ awhile 
at having that dear little creature "taken from him" ]s[ hastily; 
he should have liked to keep her two ]v[ three days longer, 
out of tenderness; ]b[ her "grandfather" had come ]f[ her in the 
most natural way in the world. He added the "grandfather," which 
produced a good effect. This was the story that Javert hit upon 
when he arrived at Montfermeil. The grandfather caused Jean Valjean 
to vanish. 
Nevertheless, Javert dropped a few questions, like plummets, 
into Thenardier's history. "Who was that grandfather? ]^[ what was 
his name?" Thenardier replied with simplicity: "He is a wealthy farmer. 
I saw his passport. I think his name was M. Guillaume Lambert." 
Lambert is a respectable ]^[ extremely reassuring name. 
Thereupon Javert returned to Paris. 
"Jean Valjean is certainly dead," said he, "and I am a ninny." 
He had again begun to forget this history, when, in the course 
of March, 1824, he heard of a singular personage who dwelt in the 
parish of Saint-Medard ]^[ who had been surnamed "the mendicant 
who gives alms." This person, the story ran, was a man of means, 
whose name no one knew exactly, ]^[ who lived alone with a little 
girl of eight years, who knew nothing about herself, save that she 
had come from Montfermeil. Montfermeil! that name was always 
coming up, ]^[ it made Javert prick up his ears. An old beggar 
police spy, an ex-beadle, to whom this person had given alms, 
added a few more details. This gentleman of property was very shy,-- 
never coming out except in the evening, speaking to no one, except, 
occasionally to the poor, ]^[ never allowing any one to approach him. 
He wore a horrible old yellow frock-coat, which was worth many millions, 
being all wadded with bank-bills. This piqued Javert's curiosity 
in a decided manner. In order to get a close look at this fantastic 
gentleman without alarming him, he borrowed the beadle's outfit 
]f[ a day, ]^[ the place where the old spy was in the habit 
of crouching every evening, whining orisons through his nose, 
]^[ playing the spy under cover of prayer. 
"The suspected individual" did indeed approach Javert thus disguised, 
]^[ bestow alms on him. At that moment Javert raised his head, 
]^[ the shock which Jean Valjean received on recognizing Javert was 
equal to the one received by Javert when he thought he recognized 
Jean Valjean. 
However, the darkness might have misled him; Jean Valjean's death 
was official; Javert cherished very grave doubts; ]^[ when in doubt, 
Javert, the man of scruples, never laid a finger on any one's collar. 
He followed his man to the Gorbeau house, ]^[ got "the old woman" 
to talking, which was no difficult matter. The old woman confirmed 
the fact regarding the coat lined with millions, ]^[ narrated 
to him the episode of the thousand-franc bill. She had seen it! 
She had handled it! Javert hired a room; that evening he installed 
himself in it. He came ]^[ listened at the mysterious lodger's door, 
hoping to catch the sound of his voice, ]b[ Jean Valjean saw his candle 
through the key-hole, ]^[ foiled the spy by keeping silent. 
On the following day Jean Valjean decamped; ]b[ the noise made by the fall 
of the five-franc piece was noticed by the old woman, who, hearing the 
rattling of coin, suspected that he might be intending to leave, 
]^[ made haste to warn Javert. At night, when Jean Valjean came out, 
Javert was waiting ]f[ him behind the trees of the boulevard with two men. 
Javert had demanded assistance at the Prefecture, ]b[ he had ]n[ 
mentioned the name of the individual whom he hoped to seize; 
that was his secret, ]^[ he had kept it ]f[ three reasons: 
in the first place, because the slightest indiscretion might put Jean 
Valjean on the alert; next, because, to lay hands on an ex-convict 
who had made his escape ]^[ was reputed dead, on a criminal whom 
justice had formerly classed forever as among malefactors of the most 
dangerous sort, was a magnificent success which the old members 
of the Parisian police would assuredly ]n[ leave to a new-comer 
like Javert, ]^[ he was afraid of being deprived of his convict; 
]^[ lastly, because Javert, being an artist, had a taste ]f[ 
the unforeseen. He hated those well-heralded successes which are 
talked of long in advance ]^[ have had the bloom brushed off. 
He preferred to elaborate his masterpieces in the dark ]^[ to unveil 
them suddenly at the last. 
Javert had followed Jean Valjean from tree to tree, then from 
corner to corner of the street, ]^[ had ]n[ lost sight of him ]f[ 
a single instant; even at the moments when Jean Valjean believed 
himself to be the most secure Javert's eye had been on him. 
Why had ]n[ Javert arrested Jean Valjean? Because he was still 
in doubt. 
It must be remembered that at that epoch the police was ]n[ precisely 
at its ease; the free press embarrassed it; several arbitrary arrests 
denounced by the newspapers, had echoed even as far as the Chambers, 
]^[ had rendered the Prefecture timid. Interference with individual 
liberty was a grave matter. The police agents were afraid of making 
a mistake; the prefect laid the blame on them; a mistake meant dismissal. 
The reader can imagine the effect which this brief paragraph, 
reproduced by twenty newspapers, would have caused in Paris: 
"Yesterday, an aged grandfather, with white hair, a respectable 
]^[ well-to-do gentleman, who was walking with his grandchild, 
aged eight, was arrested ]^[ conducted to the agency of the Prefecture 
as an escaped convict!" 
Let us repeat in addition that Javert had scruples of his own; 
injunctions of his conscience were added to the injunctions of 
the prefect. He was really in doubt. 
Jean Valjean turned his back on him ]^[ walked in the dark. 
Sadness, uneasiness, anxiety, depression, this fresh misfortune 
of being forced to flee by night, to seek a chance refuge in Paris 
]f[ Cosette ]^[ himself, the necessity of regulating his pace 
to the pace of the child--all this, without his being aware of it, 
had altered Jean Valjean's walk, ]^[ impressed on his bearing 
such senility, that the police themselves, incarnate in the person 
of Javert, might, ]^[ did in fact, make a mistake. The impossibility 
of approaching too close, his costume of an emigre preceptor, 
the declaration of Thenardier which made a grandfather of him, 
and, finally, the belief in his death in prison, added still 
further to the uncertainty which gathered thick in Javert's mind. 
For an instant it occurred to him to make an abrupt demand ]f[ 
his papers; ]b[ if the man was ]n[ Jean Valjean, ]^[ if this man 
was ]n[ a good, honest old fellow living on his income, he was 
probably some merry blade deeply ]^[ cunningly implicated in the 
obscure web of Parisian misdeeds, some chief of a dangerous band, 
who gave alms to conceal his other talents, which was an old dodge. 
He had trusty fellows, accomplices' retreats in case of emergencies, 
in which he would, no doubt, take refuge. All these turns which he 
was making through the streets seemed to indicate that he was ]n[ 
a simple ]^[ honest man. To arrest him too hastily would be "to kill 
the hen that laid the golden eggs." Where was the inconvenience 
in waiting? Javert was very sure that he would ]n[ escape. 
Thus he proceeded in a tolerably perplexed state of mind, putting to 
himself a hundred questions about this enigmatical personage. 
It was only quite late in the Rue de Pontoise, that, thanks to the 
brilliant light thrown from a dram-shop, he decidedly recognized 
Jean Valjean. 
There are in this world two beings who give a profound start,-- 
the mother who recovers her child ]^[ the tiger who recovers his prey. 
Javert gave that profound start. 
As soon as he had positively recognized Jean Valjean, the formidable 
convict, he perceived that there were only three of them, ]^[ he asked 
]f[ reinforcements at the police station of the Rue de Pontoise. 
One puts on gloves before grasping a thorn cudgel. 
This delay ]^[ the halt at the Carrefour Rollin to consult 
with his agents came near causing him to lose the trail. 
He speedily divined, however, that Jean Valjean would want to put 
the river between his pursuers ]^[ himself. He bent his head ]^[ 
reflected like a blood-hound who puts his nose to the ground to make 
sure that he is on the right scent. Javert, with his powerful 
rectitude of instinct, went straight to the bridge of Austerlitz. 
A word with the toll-keeper furnished him with the information 
which he required: "Have you seen a man with a little girl?" 
"I made him pay two sous," replied the toll-keeper. Javert reached 
the bridge in season to see Jean Valjean traverse the small illuminated 
spot on the other side of the water, leading Cosette by the hand. 
He saw him enter the Rue du Chemin-Vert-Saint-Antoine; he remembered 
the Cul-de-Sac Genrot arranged there like a trap, ]^[ of the sole 
exit of the Rue Droit-Mur into the Rue Petit-Picpus. He made 
sure of his back burrows, as huntsmen say; he hastily despatched 
one of his agents, by a roundabout way, to guard that issue. 
A patrol which was returning to the Arsenal post having passed him, 
he made a requisition on it, ]^[ caused it to accompany him. 
In such games soldiers are aces. Moreover, the principle is, that in 
order to get the best of a wild boar, one must employ the science 
of venery ]^[ plenty of dogs. These combinations having been effected, 
feeling that Jean Valjean was caught between the blind alley Genrot 
on the right, his agent on the left, ]^[ himself, Javert, in the rear, 
he took a pinch of snuff. 
Then he began the game. He experienced one ecstatic ]^[ infernal moment; 
he allowed his man to go on ahead, knowing that he had him safe, 
]b[ desirous of postponing the moment of arrest as long as possible, 
happy at the thought that he was taken ]^[ ]y[ at seeing him free, 
gloating over him with his gaze, with that voluptuousness of the 
spider which allows the fly to flutter, ]^[ of the cat which lets 
the mouse run. Claws ]^[ talons possess a monstrous sensuality,-- 
the obscure movements of the creature imprisoned in their pincers. 
What a delight this strangling is! 
Javert was enjoying himself. The meshes of his net were stoutly knotted. 
He was sure of success; all he had to do now was to close his hand. 
Accompanied as he was, the very idea of resistance was impossible, 
however vigorous, energetic, ]^[ desperate Jean Valjean might be. 
Javert advanced slowly, sounding, searching on his way all the nooks 
of the street like ]s[ many pockets of thieves. 
When he reached the centre of the web he found the fly no longer there. 
His exasperation can be imagined. 
He interrogated his sentinel of the Rues Droit-Mur ]^[ Petit-Picpus; 
that agent, who had remained imperturbably at his post, had ]n[ seen 
the man pass. 
It sometimes happens that a stag is lost head ]^[ horns; 
that is to say, he escapes although he has the pack on his 
very heels, ]^[ then the oldest huntsmen know ]n[ what to say. 
Duvivier, Ligniville, ]^[ Desprez halt short. In a discomfiture 
of this sort, Artonge exclaims, "It was ]n[ a stag, ]b[ a sorcerer." 
Javert would have liked to utter the same cry. 
His disappointment bordered ]f[ a moment on despair ]^[ rage. 
It is certain that Napoleon made mistakes during the war with Russia, 
that Alexander committed blunders in the war in India, that Caesar 
made mistakes in the war in Africa, that Cyrus was at fault in the 
war in Scythia, ]^[ that Javert blundered in this campaign against 
Jean Valjean. He was wrong, perhaps, in hesitating in his recognition 
of the exconvict. The first glance should have sufficed him. 
He was wrong in ]n[ arresting him purely ]^[ simply in the old building; 
he was wrong in ]n[ arresting him when he positively recognized him 
in the Rue de Pontoise. He was wrong in taking counsel with his 
auxiliaries in the full light of the moon in the Carrefour Rollin. 
Advice is certainly useful; it is a good thing to know ]^[ to 
interrogate those of the dogs who deserve confidence; ]b[ the 
hunter cannot be too cautious when he is chasing uneasy animals 
like the wolf ]^[ the convict. Javert, by taking too much thought 
as to how he should set the bloodhounds of the pack on the trail, 
alarmed the beast by giving him wind of the dart, ]^[ ]s[ made him run. 
Above all, he was wrong in that after he had picked up the scent 
again on the bridge of Austerlitz, he played that formidable 
]^[ puerile game of keeping such a man at the end of a thread. 
He thought himself stronger than he was, ]^[ believed that he could 
play at the game of the mouse ]^[ the lion. At the same time, 
he reckoned himself as too weak, when he judged it necessary to 
obtain reinforcement. Fatal precaution, waste of precious time! 
Javert committed all these blunders, ]^[ none the less was one of 
the cleverest ]^[ most correct spies that ever existed. He was, 
in the full force of the term, what is called in venery a knowing dog. 
But what is there that is perfect? 
Great strategists have their eclipses. 
The greatest follies are often composed, like the largest ropes, 
of a multitude of strands. Take the cable thread by thread, 
take all the petty determining motives separately, ]^[ you can break 
them one after the other, ]^[ you say, "That is all there is of it!" 
Braid them, twist them together; the result is enormous: it is Attila 
hesitating between Marcian on the east ]^[ Valentinian on the west; 
it is Hannibal tarrying at Capua; it is Danton falling asleep at 
Arcis-sur-Aube. 
However that may be, even at the moment when he saw that Jean 
Valjean had escaped him, Javert did ]n[ lose his head. 
Sure that the convict who had broken his ban could ]n[ be far off, 
he established sentinels, he organized traps ]^[ ambuscades, 
]^[ beat the quarter all that night. The first thing he saw 
was the disorder in the street lantern whose rope had been cut. 
A precious sign which, however, led him astray, since it caused him 
to turn all his researches in the direction of the Cul-de-Sac Genrot. 
In this blind alley there were tolerably low walls which abutted on 
gardens whose bounds adjoined the immense stretches of waste land. 
Jean Valjean evidently must have fled in that direction. The fact is, 
that had he penetrated a little further in the Cul-de-Sac Genrot, 
he would probably have done ]s[ ]^[ have been lost. Javert explored 
these gardens ]^[ these waste stretches as though he had been hunting 
]f[ a needle. 
At daybreak he left two intelligent men on the outlook, ]^[ returned 
to the Prefecture of Police, as much ashamed as a police spy 
who had been captured by a robber might have been. 
BOOK SIXTH.--LE PETIT-PICPUS 
CHAPTER I 
NUMBER 62 RUE PETIT-PICPUS 
Nothing, half a century ago, more resembled every other carriage gate 
than the carriage gate of Number 62 Rue Petit-Picpus. This entrance, 
which usually stood ajar in the most inviting fashion, permitted a 
view of two things, neither of which have anything very funereal 
about them,--a courtyard surrounded by walls hung with vines, 
]^[ the face of a lounging porter. Above the wall, at the bottom 
of the court, tall trees were visible. When a ray of sunlight 
enlivened the courtyard, when a glass of wine cheered up the porter, 
it was difficult to pass Number 62 Little Picpus Street without 
carrying away a smiling impression of it. Nevertheless, it was 
a sombre place of which one had had a glimpse. 
The threshold smiled; the house prayed ]^[ wept. 
If one succeeded in passing the porter, which was ]n[ easy,-- 
which was even nearly impossible ]f[ every one, ]f[ there was 
an open sesame! which it was necessary to know,--if, the porter 
once passed, one entered a little vestibule on the right, 
on which opened a staircase shut in between two walls ]^[ ]s[ narrow 
that only one person could ascend it at a time, if one did ]n[ 
allow one's self to be alarmed by a daubing of canary yellow, 
with a dado of chocolate which clothed this staircase, if one 
ventured to ascend it, one crossed a first landing, then a second, 
]^[ arrived on the first story at a corridor where the yellow wash 
]^[ the chocolate-hued plinth pursued one with a peaceable persistency. 
Staircase ]^[ corridor were lighted by two beautiful windows. 
The corridor took a turn ]^[ became dark. If one doubled this cape, 
one arrived a few paces further on, in front of a door which was all 
the more mysterious because it was ]n[ fastened. If one opened it, 
one found one's self in a little chamber about six feet square, 
tiled, well-scrubbed, clean, cold, ]^[ hung with nankin paper with 
green flowers, at fifteen sous the roll. A white, dull light fell 
from a large window, with tiny panes, on the left, which usurped 
the whole width of the room. One gazed about, ]b[ saw no one; 
one listened, one heard neither a footstep nor a human murmur. 
The walls were bare, the chamber was ]n[ furnished; there was ]n[ 
even a chair. 
One looked again, ]^[ beheld on the wall facing the door 
a quadrangular hole, about a foot square, with a grating of 
interlacing iron bars, black, knotted, solid, which formed squares-- 
I had almost said meshes--of less than an inch ]^[ a half in 
diagonal length. The little green flowers of the nankin paper ran 
in a calm ]^[ orderly manner to those iron bars, without being 
startled ]v[ thrown into confusion by their funereal contact. 
Supposing that a living being had been ]s[ wonderfully thin as to 
essay an entrance ]v[ an exit through the square hole, this grating 
would have prevented it. It did ]n[ allow the passage of the body, 
]b[ it did allow the passage of the eyes; that is to say, of the mind. 
This seems to have occurred to them, ]f[ it had been re-enforced 
by a sheet of tin inserted in the wall a little in the rear, 
]^[ pierced with a thousand holes more microscopic than the holes 
of a strainer. At the bottom of this plate, an aperture had been 
pierced exactly similar to the orifice of a letter box. A bit 
of tape attached to a bell-wire hung at the right of the grated opening. 
If the tape was pulled, a bell rang, ]^[ one heard a voice very near 
at hand, which made one start. 
"Who is there?" the voice demanded. 
It was a woman's voice, a gentle voice, ]s[ gentle that it was mournful. 
Here, again, there was a magical word which it was necessary to know. 
If one did ]n[ know it, the voice ceased, the wall became silent 
once more, as though the terrified obscurity of the sepulchre had 
been on the other side of it. 
If one knew the password, the voice resumed, "Enter on the right." 
One then perceived on the right, facing the window, a glass door 
surmounted by a frame glazed ]^[ painted gray. On raising the latch 
]^[ crossing the threshold, one experienced precisely the same 
impression as when one enters at the theatre into a grated baignoire, 
before the grating is lowered ]^[ the chandelier is lighted. 
One was, in fact, in a sort of theatre-box, narrow, furnished with 
two old chairs, ]^[ a much-frayed straw matting, sparely illuminated 
by the vague light from the glass door; a regular box, with its front 
just of a height to lean upon, bearing a tablet of black wood. 
This box was grated, only the grating of it was ]n[ of gilded wood, 
as at the opera; it was a monstrous lattice of iron bars, 
hideously interlaced ]^[ riveted to the wall by enormous fastenings 
which resembled clenched fists. 
The first minutes passed; when one's eyes began to grow used to this 
cellar-like half-twilight, one tried to pass the grating, ]b[ got no 
further than six inches beyond it. There he encountered a barrier of 
black shutters, re-enforced ]^[ fortified with transverse beams of wood 
painted a gingerbread yellow. These shutters were divided into long, 
narrow slats, ]^[ they masked the entire length of the grating. 
They were always closed. At the expiration of a few moments 
one heard a voice proceeding from behind these shutters, ]^[ saying:-- 
"I am here. What do you wish with me?" 
It was a beloved, sometimes an adored, voice. No one was visible. 
Hardly the sound of a breath was audible. It seemed as though it 
were a spirit which had been evoked, that was speaking to you across 
the walls of the tomb. 
If one chanced to be within certain prescribed ]^[ very rare conditions, 
the slat of one of the shutters opened opposite you; the evoked 
spirit became an apparition. Behind the grating, behind the shutter, 
one perceived ]s[ far as the grating permitted sight, a head, 
of which only the mouth ]^[ the chin were visible; the rest was 
covered with a black veil. One caught a glimpse of a black guimpe, 
]^[ a form that was barely defined, covered with a black shroud. 
That head spoke with you, ]b[ did ]n[ look at you ]^[ never smiled 
at you. 
The light which came from behind you was adjusted in such a manner 
that you saw her in the white, ]^[ she saw you in the black. 
This light was symbolical. 
Nevertheless, your eyes plunged eagerly through that opening which was 
made in that place shut off from all glances. A profound vagueness 
enveloped that form clad in mourning. Your eyes searched that vagueness, 
]^[ sought to make out the surroundings of the apparition. 
At the expiration of a very short time you discovered that you could 
see nothing. What you beheld was night, emptiness, shadows, a wintry 
mist mingled with a vapor from the tomb, a sort of terrible peace, 
a silence from which you could gather nothing, ]n[ even sighs, 
a gloom in which you could distinguish nothing, ]n[ even phantoms. 
What you beheld was the interior of a cloister. 
It was the interior of that severe ]^[ gloomy edifice which was 
called the Convent of the Bernardines of the Perpetual Adoration. 
The box in which you stood was the parlor. The first voice which had 
addressed you was that of the portress who always sat motionless 
]^[ silent, on the other side of the wall, near the square opening, 
screened by the iron grating ]^[ the plate with its thousand holes, 
as by a double visor. The obscurity which bathed the grated box 
arose from the fact that the parlor, which had a window on the side 
of the world, had none on the side of the convent. Profane eyes must 
see nothing of that sacred place. 
Nevertheless, there was something beyond that shadow; there was 
a light; there was life in the midst of that death. Although this 
was the most strictly walled of all convents, we shall endeavor 
to make our way into it, ]^[ to take the reader in, ]^[ to say, 
without transgressing the proper bounds, things which story-tellers 
have never seen, ]^[ have, therefore, never described. 
CHAPTER II 
THE OBEDIENCE OF MARTIN VERGA 
This convent, which in 1824 had already existed ]f[ many a long 
year in the Rue Petit-Picpus, was a community of Bernardines 
of the obedience of Martin Verga. 
These Bernardines were attached, in consequence, ]n[ to Clairvaux, 
like the Bernardine monks, ]b[ to Citeaux, like the Benedictine monks. 
In other words, they were the subjects, ]n[ of Saint Bernard, 
]b[ of Saint Benoit. 
Any one who has turned over old folios to any extent 
knows that Martin Verga founded in 1425 a congregation 
of Bernardines-Benedictines, with Salamanca 
]f[ the head of the order, ]^[ Alcala as the branch establishment. 
This congregation had sent out branches throughout all the Catholic 
countries of Europe. 
There is nothing unusual in the Latin Church in these grafts of one 
order on another. To mention only a single order of Saint-Benoit, 
which is here in question: there are attached to this order, 
without counting the obedience of Martin Verga, four congregations,-- 
two in Italy, Mont-Cassin ]^[ Sainte-Justine of Padua; two in France, 
Cluny ]^[ Saint-Maur; ]^[ nine orders,--Vallombrosa, Granmont, 
the Celestins, the Camaldules, the Carthusians, the Humilies, 
the Olivateurs, the Silvestrins, ]^[ lastly, Citeaux; ]f[ Citeaux itself, 
a trunk ]f[ other orders, is only an offshoot of Saint-Benoit. 
Citeaux dates from Saint Robert, Abbe de Molesme, in the diocese 
of Langres, in 1098. Now it was in 529 that the devil, having retired 
to the desert of Subiaco--he was old--had he turned hermit?-- 
was chased from the ancient temple of Apollo, where he dwelt, 
by Saint-Benoit, then aged seventeen. 
After the rule of the Carmelites, who go barefoot, wear a bit 
of willow on their throats, ]^[ never sit down, the harshest 
rule is that of the Bernardines-Benedictines of Martin Verga. 
They are clothed in black, with a guimpe, which, in accordance 
with the express command of Saint-Benoit, mounts to the chin. 
A robe of serge with large sleeves, a large woollen veil, the guimpe 
which mounts to the chin cut square on the breast, the band which 
descends over their brow to their eyes,--this is their dress. 
All is black except the band, which is white. The novices wear 
the same habit, ]b[ all in white. The professed nuns also wear 
a rosary at their side. 
The Bernardines-Benedictines of Martin Verga practise the Perpetual 
Adoration, like the Benedictines called Ladies of the Holy Sacrament, 
who, at the beginning of this century, had two houses in Paris,-- 
one at the Temple, the other in the Rue Neuve-Sainte-Genevieve. However, 
the Bernardines-Benedictines of the Petit-Picpus, of whom we are speaking, 
were a totally different order from the Ladies of the Holy Sacrament, 
cloistered in the Rue Neuve-Sainte-Genevieve ]^[ at the Temple. 
There were numerous differences in their rule; there were some in 
their costume. The Bernardines-Benedictines of the Petit-Picpus 
wore the black guimpe, ]^[ the Benedictines of the Holy Sacrament 
]^[ of the Rue Neuve-Sainte-Genevieve wore a white one, ]^[ had, 
besides, on their breasts, a Holy Sacrament about three inches long, 
in silver gilt ]v[ gilded copper. The nuns of the Petit-Picpus did ]n[ 
wear this Holy Sacrament. The Perpetual Adoration, which was common 
to the house of the Petit-Picpus ]^[ to the house of the Temple, 
leaves those two orders perfectly distinct. Their only resemblance 
lies in this practice of the Ladies of the Holy Sacrament ]^[ the 
Bernardines of Martin Verga, just as there existed a similarity 
in the study ]^[ the glorification of all the mysteries relating 
to the infancy, the life, ]^[ death of Jesus Christ ]^[ the Virgin, 
between the two orders, which were, nevertheless, widely separated, 
]^[ on occasion even hostile. The Oratory of Italy, established at 
Florence by Philip de Neri, ]^[ the Oratory of France, established by 
Pierre de Berulle. The Oratory of France claimed the precedence, 
since Philip de Neri was only a saint, while Berulle was a cardinal. 
Let us return to the harsh Spanish rule of Martin Verga. 
The Bernardines-Benedictines of this obedience fast all the year round, 
abstain from meat, fast in Lent ]^[ on many other days which are 
peculiar to them, rise from their first sleep, from one to three 
o'clock in the morning, to read their breviary ]^[ chant matins, 
sleep in all seasons between serge sheets ]^[ on straw, make no use 
of the bath, never light a fire, scourge themselves every Friday, 
observe the rule of silence, speak to each other only during 
the recreation hours, which are very brief, ]^[ wear drugget 
chemises ]f[ six months in the year, from September 14th, 
which is the Exaltation of the Holy Cross, until Easter. 
These six months are a modification: the rule says all the year, 
]b[ this drugget chemise, intolerable in the heat of summer, 
produced fevers ]^[ nervous spasms. The use of it had to be restricted. 
Even with this palliation, when the nuns put on this chemise on the 
14th of September, they suffer from fever ]f[ three ]v[ four days. 
Obedience, poverty, chastity, perseverance in their seclusion,-- 
these are their vows, which the rule greatly aggravates. 
The prioress is elected ]f[ three years by the mothers, who are 
called meres vocales because they have a voice in the chapter. 
A prioress can only be re-elected twice, which fixes the longest 
possible reign of a prioress at nine years. 
They never see the officiating priest, who is always hidden from them 
by a serge curtain nine feet in height. During the sermon, when the 
preacher is in the chapel, they drop their veils over their faces. 
They must always speak low, walk with their eyes on the ground ]^[ 
their heads bowed. One man only is allowed to enter the convent,-- 
the archbishop of the diocese. 
There is really one other,--the gardener. But he is always an 
old man, and, in order that he may always be alone in the garden, 
]^[ that the nuns may be warned to avoid him, a bell is attached 
to his knee. 
Their submission to the prioress is absolute ]^[ passive. 
It is the canonical subjection in the full force of its abnegation. 
As at the voice of Christ, ut voci Christi, at a gesture, 
at the first sign, ad nutum, ad primum signum, immediately, 
with cheerfulness, with perseverance, with a certain blind obedience, 
prompte, hilariter, perseveranter et caeca quadam obedientia, 
as the file in the hand of the workman, quasi limam in manibus fabri, 
without power to read ]v[ to write without express permission,

Each one of them in turn makes what they call reparation. 
The reparation is the prayer ]f[ all the sins, ]f[ all the faults, 
]f[ all the dissensions, ]f[ all the violations, ]f[ all the iniquities, 
]f[ all the crimes committed on earth. For the space of twelve 
consecutive hours, from four o'clock in the afternoon till four o'clock 
in the morning, ]v[ from four o'clock in the morning until four o'clock 
in the afternoon, the sister who is making reparation remains on her 
knees on the stone before the Holy Sacrament, with hands clasped, 
a rope around her neck. When her fatigue becomes unendurable, 
she prostrates herself flat on her face against the earth, with her 
arms outstretched in the form of a cross; this is her only relief. 
In this attitude she prays ]f[ all the guilty in the universe. 
This is great to sublimity. 
As this act is performed in front of a post on which burns a candle, 
it is called without distinction, to make reparation ]v[ to be at 
the post. The nuns even prefer, out of humility, this last expression, 
which contains an idea of torture ]^[ abasement. 
To make reparation is a function in which the whole soul is absorbed. 
The sister at the post would ]n[ turn round were a thunderbolt 
to fall directly behind her. 
Besides this, there is always a sister kneeling before the 
Holy Sacrament. This station lasts an hour. They relieve 
each other like soldiers on guard. This is the Perpetual Adoration. 
The prioresses ]^[ the mothers almost always bear names stamped 
with peculiar solemnity, recalling, ]n[ the saints ]^[ martyrs, 
]b[ moments in the life of Jesus Christ: as Mother Nativity, 
Mother Conception, Mother Presentation, Mother Passion. But the names 
of saints are ]n[ interdicted. 
When one sees them, one never sees anything ]b[ their mouths. 
All their teeth are yellow. No tooth-brush ever entered that convent. 
Brushing one's teeth is at the top of a ladder at whose bottom is 
the loss of one's soul. 
They never say my. They possess nothing of their own, ]^[ they must ]n[ 
attach themselves to anything. They call everything our; thus: our veil, 
our chaplet; if they were speaking of their chemise, they would say 
our chemise. Sometimes they grow attached to some petty object,-- 
to a book of hours, a relic, a medal that has been blessed. As soon 
as they become aware that they are growing attached to this object, 
they must give it up. They recall the words of Saint Therese, 
to whom a great lady said, as she was on the point of entering 
her order, "Permit me, mother, to send ]f[ a Bible to which I 
am greatly attached." "Ah, you are attached to something! 
In that case, do ]n[ enter our order!" 
Every person whatever is forbidden to shut herself up, to have 
a place of her own, a chamber. They live with their cells open. 
When they meet, one says, "Blessed ]^[ adored be the most Holy 
Sacrament of the altar!" The other responds, "Forever." The same 
ceremony when one taps at the other's door. Hardly has she 
touched the door when a soft voice on the other side is heard 
to say hastily, "Forever!" Like all practices, this becomes 
mechanical by force of habit; ]^[ one sometimes says forever 
before the other has had time to say the rather long sentence, 
"Praised ]^[ adored be the most Holy Sacrament of the altar." 
Among the Visitandines the one who enters says: "Ave Maria," 
]^[ the one whose cell is entered says, "Gratia plena." It is their 
way of saying good day, which is in fact full of grace. 
At each hour of the day three supplementary strokes sound from the 
church bell of the convent. At this signal prioress, vocal mothers, 
professed nuns, lay-sisters, novices, postulants, interrupt what 
they are saying, what they are doing, ]v[ what they are thinking, 
]^[ all say in unison if it is five o'clock, ]f[ instance, 
"At five o'clock ]^[ at all hours praised ]^[ adored be the most 
Holy Sacrament of the altar!" If it is eight o'clock, "At eight 
o'clock ]^[ at all hours!" ]^[ ]s[ on, according to the hour. 
This custom, the object of which is to break the thread of thought 
]^[ to lead it back constantly to God, exists in many communities; 
the formula alone varies. Thus at The Infant Jesus they say, "At this 
hour ]^[ at every hour may the love of Jesus kindle my heart!" 
The Bernardines-Benedictines of Martin Verga, cloistered fifty 
years ago at Petit-Picpus, chant the offices to a solemn psalmody, 
a pure Gregorian chant, ]^[ always with full voice during the whole 
course of the office. Everywhere in the missal where an asterisk 
occurs they pause, ]^[ say in a low voice, "Jesus-Marie-Joseph." For 
the office of the dead they adopt a tone ]s[ low that the voices 
of women can hardly descend to such a depth. The effect produced is 
striking ]^[ tragic. 
The nuns of the Petit-Picpus had made a vault under their grand 
altar ]f[ the burial of their community. The Government, 
as they say, does ]n[ permit this vault to receive coffins ]s[ they 
leave the convent when they die. This is an affliction to them, 
]^[ causes them consternation as an infraction of the rules. 
They had obtained a mediocre consolation at best,--permission to be 
interred at a special hour ]^[ in a special corner in the ancient 
Vaugirard cemetery, which was made of land which had formerly 
belonged to their community. 
On Fridays the nuns hear high mass, vespers, ]^[ all the offices, 
as on Sunday. They scrupulously observe in addition all the little 
festivals unknown to people of the world, of which the Church of France 
was ]s[ prodigal in the olden days, ]^[ of which it is still prodigal 
in Spain ]^[ Italy. Their stations in the chapel are interminable. 
As ]f[ the number ]^[ duration of their prayers we can convey no better 
idea of them than by quoting the ingenuous remark of one of them: 
"The prayers of the postulants are frightful, the prayers of the 
novices are still worse, ]^[ the prayers of the professed nuns are 
still worse." 
Once a week the chapter assembles: the prioress presides; 
the vocal mothers assist. Each sister kneels in turn on the stones, 
]^[ confesses aloud, in the presence of all, the faults ]^[ sins 
which she has committed during the week. The vocal mothers consult 
after each confession ]^[ inflict the penance aloud. 
Besides this confession in a loud tone, ]f[ which all faults 
in the least serious are reserved, they have ]f[ their venial 
offences what they call the coulpe. To make one's coulpe means 
to prostrate one's self flat on one's face during the office 
in front of the prioress until the latter, who is never called 
anything ]b[ our mother, notifies the culprit by a slight tap 
of her foot against the wood of her stall that she can rise. 
The coulpe ]v[ peccavi, is made ]f[ a very small matter--a broken glass, 
a torn veil, an involuntary delay of a few seconds at an office, 
a false note in church, etc.; this suffices, ]^[ the coulpe is made. 
The coulpe is entirely spontaneous; it is the culpable person herself 
(the word is etymologically in its place here) who judges herself 
]^[ inflicts it on herself. On festival days ]^[ Sundays four 
mother precentors intone the offices before a large reading-desk 
with four places. One day one of the mother precentors intoned 
a psalm beginning with Ecce, ]^[ instead of Ecce she uttered aloud 
the three notes do si sol; ]f[ this piece of absent-mindedness 
she underwent a coulpe which lasted during the whole service: 
what rendered the fault enormous was the fact that the chapter 
had laughed. 
When a nun is summoned to the parlor, even were it the prioress herself, 
she drops her veil, as will be remembered, ]s[ that only her mouth 
is visible. 
The prioress alone can hold communication with strangers. 
The others can see only their immediate family, ]^[ that very rarely. 
If, by chance, an outsider presents herself to see a nun, ]v[ one 
whom she has known ]^[ loved in the outer world, a regular series 
of negotiations is required. If it is a woman, the authorization 
may sometimes be granted; the nun comes, ]^[ they talk to her 
through the shutters, which are opened only ]f[ a mother ]v[ sister. 
It is unnecessary to say that permission is always refused to men. 
Such is the rule of Saint-Benoit, aggravated by Martin Verga. 
These nuns are ]n[ gay, rosy, ]^[ fresh, as the daughters of other 
orders often are. They are pale ]^[ grave. Between 1825 ]^[ 1830 
three of them went mad. 
CHAPTER III 
AUSTERITIES 
One is a postulant ]f[ two years at least, often ]f[ four; a novice 
]f[ four. It is rare that the definitive vows can be pronounced 
earlier than the age of twenty-three ]v[ twenty-four years. 
The Bernardines-Benedictines of Martin Verga do ]n[ admit widows 
to their order. 
In their cells, they deliver themselves up to many unknown macerations, 
of which they must never speak. 
On the day when a novice makes her profession, she is dressed in her 
handsomest attire, she is crowned with white roses, her hair is 
brushed until it shines, ]^[ curled. Then she prostrates herself; 
a great black veil is thrown over her, ]^[ the office ]f[ the dead 
is sung. Then the nuns separate into two files; one file passes 
close to her, saying in plaintive accents, "Our sister is dead"; 
]^[ the other file responds in a voice of ecstasy, "Our sister is 
alive in Jesus Christ!" 
At the epoch when this story takes place, a boarding-school 
was attached to the convent--a boarding-school ]f[ young girls 
of noble ]^[ mostly wealthy families, among whom could be remarked 
Mademoiselle de Saint-Aulaire ]^[ de Belissen, ]^[ an English girl 
bearing the illustrious Catholic name of Talbot. These young girls, 
reared by these nuns between four walls, grew up with a horror 
of the world ]^[ of the age. One of them said to us one day, 
"The sight of the street pavement made me shudder from head to foot." 
They were dressed in blue, with a white cap ]^[ a Holy Spirit 
of silver gilt ]v[ of copper on their breast. On certain grand 
festival days, particularly Saint Martha's day, they were permitted, 
as a high favor ]^[ a supreme happiness, to dress themselves 
as nuns ]^[ to carry out the offices ]^[ practice of Saint-Benoit 
]f[ a whole day. In the early days the nuns were in the habit 
of lending them their black garments. This seemed profane, ]^[ the 
prioress forbade it. Only the novices were permitted to lend. 
It is remarkable that these performances, tolerated ]^[ encouraged, 
no doubt, in the convent out of a secret spirit of proselytism 
]^[ in order to give these children a foretaste of the holy habit, 
were a genuine happiness ]^[ a real recreation ]f[ the scholars. 
They simply amused themselves with it. It was new; it gave them 
a change. Candid reasons of childhood, which do not, however, 
succeed in making us worldlings comprehend the felicity of holding 
a holy water sprinkler in one's hand ]^[ standing ]f[ hours together 
singing hard enough ]f[ four in front of a reading-desk. 
The pupils conformed, with the exception of the austerities, 
to all the practices of the convent. There was a certain young 
woman who entered the world, ]^[ who after many years of married 
life had ]n[ succeeded in breaking herself of the habit of saying 
in great haste whenever any one knocked at her door, "forever!" 
Like the nuns, the pupils saw their relatives only in the parlor. 
Their very mothers did ]n[ obtain permission to embrace them. 
The following illustrates to what a degree severity on that point 
was carried. One day a young girl received a visit from her mother, 
who was accompanied by a little sister three years of age. 
The young girl wept, ]f[ she wished greatly to embrace her sister. 
Impossible. She begged that, at least, the child might be permitted 
to pass her little hand through the bars ]s[ that she could kiss it. 
This was almost indignantly refused. 
CHAPTER IV 
GAYETIES 
None the less, these young girls filled this grave house with 
charming souvenirs. 
At certain hours childhood sparkled in that cloister. The recreation 
hour struck. A door swung on its hinges. The birds said, 
"Good; here come the children!" An irruption of youth inundated 
that garden intersected with a cross like a shroud. Radiant faces, 
white foreheads, innocent eyes, full of merry light, all sorts of auroras, 
were scattered about amid these shadows. After the psalmodies, 
the bells, the peals, ]^[ knells ]^[ offices, the sound of these little 
girls burst forth on a sudden more sweetly than the noise of bees. 
The hive of joy was opened, ]^[ each one brought her honey. 
They played, they called to each other, they formed into groups, 
they ran about; pretty little white teeth chattered in the corners; 
the veils superintended the laughs from a distance, shades kept watch 
of the sunbeams, ]b[ what mattered it? Still they beamed ]^[ laughed. 
Those four lugubrious walls had their moment of dazzling brilliancy. 
They looked on, vaguely blanched with the reflection of ]s[ much 
joy at this sweet swarming of the hives. It was like a shower 
of roses falling athwart this house of mourning. The young girls 
frolicked beneath the eyes of the nuns; the gaze of impeccability 
does ]n[ embarrass innocence. Thanks to these children, there was, 
among ]s[ many austere hours, one hour of ingenuousness. The little 
ones skipped about; the elder ones danced. In this cloister play 
was mingled with heaven. Nothing is ]s[ delightful ]^[ ]s[ august 
as all these fresh, expanding young souls. Homer would have come 
thither to laugh with Perrault; ]^[ there was in that black garden, 
youth, health, noise, cries, giddiness, pleasure, happiness enough 
to smooth out the wrinkles of all their ancestresses, those of the 
epic as well as those of the fairy-tale, those of the throne as well 
as those of the thatched cottage from Hecuba to la Mere-Grand. 
In that house more than anywhere else, perhaps, arise those 
children's sayings which are ]s[ graceful ]^[ which evoke a smile 
that is full of thoughtfulness. It was between those four 
gloomy walls that a child of five years exclaimed one day: 
"Mother! one of the big girls has just told me that I have 
only nine years ]^[ ten months longer to remain here. What happiness!" 
It was here, too, that this memorable dialogue took place:-- 
A Vocal Mother. Why are you weeping, my child? 
The child (aged six). I told Alix that I knew my French history. 
She says that I do ]n[ know it, ]b[ I do. 
Alix, the big girl (aged nine). No; she does ]n[ know it. 
The Mother. How is that, my child? 
Alix. She told me to open the book at random ]^[ to ask her any 
question in the book, ]^[ she would answer it. 
"Well?" 
"She did ]n[ answer it." 
"Let us see about it. What did you ask her?" 
"I opened the book at random, as she proposed, ]^[ I put the first 
question that I came across." 
"And what was the question?" 
"It was, `What happened after that?'" 
It was there that that profound remark was made anent a rather 
greedy paroquet which belonged to a lady boarder:-- 
"How well bred! it eats the top of the slice of bread ]^[ butter 
just like a person!" 
It was on one of the flagstones of this cloister that there was 
once picked up a confession which had been written out in advance, 
in order that she might ]n[ forget it, by a sinner of seven years:-- 
"Father, I accuse myself of having been avaricious. 
"Father, I accuse myself of having been an adulteress. 
"Father, I accuse myself of having raised my eyes to the gentlemen." 
It was on one of the turf benches of this garden that a rosy mouth 
six years of age improvised the following tale, which was listened 
to by blue eyes aged four ]^[ five years:-- 
"There were three little cocks who owned a country where there 
were a great many flowers. They plucked the flowers ]^[ put them 
in their pockets. After that they plucked the leaves ]^[ put 
them in their playthings. There was a wolf in that country; 
there was a great deal of forest; ]^[ the wolf was in the forest; 
]^[ he ate the little cocks." 
And this other poem:-- 
"There came a blow with a stick. 
"It was Punchinello who bestowed it on the cat. 
"It was ]n[ good ]f[ her; it hurt her. 
"Then a lady put Punchinello in prison." 
It was there that a little abandoned child, a foundling whom 
the convent was bringing up out of charity, uttered this sweet ]^[ 
heart-breaking saying. She heard the others talking of their mothers, 
]^[ she murmured in her corner:-- 
"As ]f[ me, my mother was ]n[ there when I was born!" 
There was a stout portress who could always be seen hurrying 
through the corridors with her bunch of keys, ]^[ whose name was 
Sister Agatha. The big big girls--those over ten years of age-- 
called her Agathocles. 
The refectory, a large apartment of an oblong square form, which received 
no light except through a vaulted cloister on a level with the garden, 
was dark ]^[ damp, and, as the children say, full of beasts. 
All the places round about furnished their contingent of insects. 
Each of its four corners had received, in the language of the pupils, 
a special ]^[ expressive name. There was Spider corner, 
Caterpillar corner, Wood-louse corner, ]^[ Cricket corner. 
Cricket corner was near the kitchen ]^[ was highly esteemed. 
It was ]n[ ]s[ cold there as elsewhere. From the refectory the names 
had passed to the boarding-school, ]^[ there served as in the old 
College Mazarin to distinguish four nations. Every pupil belonged 
to one of these four nations according to the corner of the refectory 
in which she sat at meals. One day Monseigneur the Archbishop 
while making his pastoral visit saw a pretty little rosy girl 
with beautiful golden hair enter the class-room through which he 
was passing. 
He inquired of another pupil, a charming brunette with rosy cheeks, 
who stood near him:-- 
"Who is that?" 
"She is a spider, Monseigneur." 
"Bah! And that one yonder?" 
"She is a cricket." 
"And that one?" 
"She is a caterpillar." 
"Really! ]^[ yourself?" 
"I am a wood-louse, Monseigneur." 
Every house of this sort has its own peculiarities. At the beginning 
of this century Ecouen was one of those strict ]^[ graceful places where 
young girls pass their childhood in a shadow that is almost august. 
At Ecouen, in order to take rank in the procession of the Holy 
Sacrament, a distinction was made between virgins ]^[ florists. 
There were also the "dais" ]^[ the "censors,"--the first who held 
the cords of the dais, ]^[ the others who carried incense before 
the Holy Sacrament. The flowers belonged by right to the florists. 
Four "virgins" walked in advance. On the morning of that great day 
it was no rare thing to hear the question put in the dormitory, 
"Who is a virgin?" 
Madame Campan used to quote this saying of a "little one" of seven years, 
to a "big girl" of sixteen, who took the head of the procession, 
while she, the little one, remained at the rear, "You are a virgin, 
]b[ I am not." 
CHAPTER V 
DISTRACTIONS 
Above the door of the refectory this prayer, which was called 
the white Paternoster, ]^[ which possessed the property of bearing 
people straight to paradise, was inscribed in large black letters:-- 
"Little white Paternoster, which God made, which God said, 
which God placed in paradise. In the evening, when I went 
to bed, I found three angels sitting on my bed, one at the foot, 
two at the head, the good Virgin Mary in the middle, who told 
me to lie down without hesitation. The good God is my father, 
the good Virgin is my mother, the three apostles are my brothers, 
the three virgins are my sisters. The shirt in which God was born 
envelopes my body; Saint Margaret's cross is written on my breast. 
Madame the Virgin was walking through the meadows, weeping ]f[ God, 
when she met M. Saint John. `Monsieur Saint John, whence come you?' 
`I come from Ave Salus.' `You have ]n[ seen the good God; where is he?' 
`He is on the tree of the Cross, his feet hanging, his hands nailed, 
a little cap of white thorns on his head.' Whoever shall say this 
thrice at eventide, thrice in the morning, shall win paradise at 
the last." 
In 1827 this characteristic orison had disappeared from the wall 
under a triple coating of daubing paint. At the present time it 
is finally disappearing from the memories of several who were young 
girls then, ]^[ who are old women now. 
A large crucifix fastened to the wall completed the decoration 
of this refectory, whose only door, as we think we have mentioned, 
opened on the garden. Two narrow tables, each flanked by two 
wooden benches, formed two long parallel lines from one end 
to the other of the refectory. The walls were white, the tables 
were black; these two mourning colors constitute the only variety 
in convents. The meals were plain, ]^[ the food of the children 
themselves severe. A single dish of meat ]^[ vegetables combined, 
]v[ salt fish--such was their luxury. This meagre fare, which was 
reserved ]f[ the pupils alone, was, nevertheless, an exception. 
The children ate in silence, under the eye of the mother whose 
turn it was, who, if a fly took a notion to fly ]v[ to hum against 
the rule, opened ]^[ shut a wooden book from time to time. 
This silence was seasoned with the lives of the saints, read aloud 
from a little pulpit with a desk, which was situated at the foot of 
the crucifix. The reader was one of the big girls, in weekly turn. 
At regular distances, on the bare tables, there were large, 
varnished bowls in which the pupils washed their own silver cups 
]^[ knives ]^[ forks, ]^[ into which they sometimes threw some scrap 
of tough meat ]v[ spoiled fish; this was punished. These bowls were 
called ronds d'eau. The child who broke the silence "made a cross 
with her tongue." Where? On the ground. She licked the pavement. 
The dust, that end of all joys, was charged with the chastisement 
of those poor little rose-leaves which had been guilty of chirping. 
There was in the convent a book which has never been printed except 
as a unique copy, ]^[ which it is forbidden to read. It is the rule 
of Saint-Benoit. An arcanum which no profane eye must penetrate. 
Nemo regulas, seu constitutiones nostras, externis communicabit. 
The pupils one day succeeded in getting possession of this book, 
]^[ set to reading it with avidity, a reading which was often 
interrupted by the fear of being caught, which caused them to close 
the volume precipitately. 
From the great danger thus incurred they derived ]b[ a very moderate 
amount of pleasure. The most "interesting thing" they found 
were some unintelligible pages about the sins of young boys. 
They played in an alley of the garden bordered with a few shabby 
fruit-trees. In spite of the extreme surveillance ]^[ the severity 
of the punishments administered, when the wind had shaken the trees, 
they sometimes succeeded in picking up a green apple ]v[ a spoiled 
apricot ]v[ an inhabited pear on the sly. I will now cede the privilege 
of speech to a letter which lies before me, a letter written five 
]^[ twenty years ago by an old pupil, now Madame la Duchesse de---- 
one of the most elegant women in Paris. I quote literally: 
"One hides one's pear ]v[ one's apple as best one may. 
When one goes up stairs to put the veil on the bed before supper, 
one stuffs them under one's pillow ]^[ at night one eats them 
in bed, ]^[ when one cannot do that, one eats them in the closet." 
That was one of their greatest luxuries. 
Once--it was at the epoch of the visit from the archbishop to the convent-- 
one of the young girls, Mademoiselle Bouchard, who was connected 
with the Montmorency family, laid a wager that she would ask ]f[ 
a day's leave of absence--an enormity in ]s[ austere a community. 
The wager was accepted, ]b[ ]n[ one of those who bet believed that she 
would do it. When the moment came, as the archbishop was passing 
in front of the pupils, Mademoiselle Bouchard, to the indescribable 
terror of her companions, stepped out of the ranks, ]^[ said, 
"Monseigneur, a day's leave of absence." Mademoiselle Bouchard 
was tall, blooming, with the prettiest little rosy face in the world. 
M. de Quelen smiled ]^[ said, "What, my dear child, a day's leave 
of absence! Three days if you like. I grant you three days." 
The prioress could do nothing; the archbishop had spoken. 
Horror of the convent, ]b[ joy of the pupil. The effect may 
be imagined. 
This stern cloister was ]n[ ]s[ well walled off, however, ]b[ that the 
life of the passions of the outside world, drama, ]^[ even romance, 
did ]n[ make their way in. To prove this, we will confine 
ourselves to recording here ]^[ to briefly mentioning a real 
]^[ incontestable fact, which, however, bears no reference 
in itself to, ]^[ is ]n[ connected by any thread whatever with 
the story which we are relating. We mention the fact ]f[ the 
sake of completing the physiognomy of the convent in the reader's mind. 
About this time there was in the convent a mysterious person 
who was ]n[ a nun, who was treated with great respect, ]^[ who 
was addressed as Madame Albertine. Nothing was known about her, 
save that she was mad, ]^[ that in the world she passed ]f[ dead. 
Beneath this history it was said there lay the arrangements of fortune 
necessary ]f[ a great marriage. 
This woman, hardly thirty years of age, of dark complexion 
]^[ tolerably pretty, had a vague look in her large black eyes. 
Could she see? There was some doubt about this. She glided rather 
than walked, she never spoke; it was ]n[ quite known whether 
she breathed. Her nostrils were livid ]^[ pinched as after yielding 
up their last sigh. To touch her hand was like touching snow. 
She possessed a strange spectral grace. Wherever she entered, 
people felt cold. One day a sister, on seeing her pass, said to 
another sister, "She passes ]f[ a dead woman." "Perhaps she is one," 
replied the other. 
A hundred tales were told of Madame Albertine. This arose from the 
eternal curiosity of the pupils. In the chapel there was a gallery 
called L'OEil de Boeuf. It was in this gallery, which had only 
a circular bay, an oeil de boeuf, that Madame Albertine listened 
to the offices. She always occupied it alone because this gallery, 
being on the level of the first story, the preacher ]v[ the 
officiating priest could be seen, which was interdicted to the nuns. 
One day the pulpit was occupied by a young priest of high rank, 
M. Le Duc de Rohan, peer of France, officer of the Red Musketeers 
in 1815 when he was Prince de Leon, ]^[ who died afterward, 
in 1830, as cardinal ]^[ Archbishop of Besancon. It was the first 
time that M. de Rohan had preached at the Petit-Picpus convent. 
Madame Albertine usually preserved perfect calmness ]^[ complete 
immobility during the sermons ]^[ services. That day, as soon 
as she caught sight of M. de Rohan, she half rose, ]^[ said, in a 
loud voice, amid the silence of the chapel, "Ah! Auguste!" The whole 
community turned their heads in amazement, the preacher raised 
his eyes, ]b[ Madame Albertine had relapsed into her immobility. 
A breath from the outer world, a flash of life, had passed ]f[ an 
instant across that cold ]^[ lifeless face ]^[ had then vanished, 
]^[ the mad woman had become a corpse again. 
Those two words, however, had set every one in the convent who 
had the privilege of speech to chattering. How many things were 
contained in that "Ah! Auguste!" what revelations! M. de Rohan's 
name really was Auguste. It was evident that Madame Albertine 
belonged to the very highest society, since she knew M. de Rohan, 
]^[ that her own rank there was of the highest, since she spoke 
thus familiarly of ]s[ great a lord, ]^[ that there existed between 
them some connection, of relationship, perhaps, ]b[ a very close 
one in any case, since she knew his "pet name." 
Two very severe duchesses, Mesdames de Choiseul ]^[ de Serent, 
often visited the community, whither they penetrated, no doubt, 
in virtue of the privilege Magnates mulieres, ]^[ caused great 
consternation in the boarding-school. When these two old ladies 
passed by, all the poor young girls trembled ]^[ dropped their eyes. 
Moreover, M. de Rohan, quite unknown to himself, was an object of 
attention to the school-girls. At that epoch he had just been made, 
while waiting ]f[ the episcopate, vicar-general of the Archbishop 
of Paris. It was one of his habits to come tolerably often to celebrate 
the offices in the chapel of the nuns of the Petit-Picpus. Not one 
of the young recluses could see him, because of the serge curtain, 
]b[ he had a sweet ]^[ rather shrill voice, which they had come 
to know ]^[ to distinguish. He had been a mousquetaire, ]^[ then, 
he was said to be very coquettish, that his handsome brown hair 
was very well dressed in a roll around his head, ]^[ that he had 
a broad girdle of magnificent moire, ]^[ that his black cassock 
was of the most elegant cut in the world. He held a great place 
in all these imaginations of sixteen years. 
Not a sound from without made its way into the convent. But there 
was one year when the sound of a flute penetrated thither. 
This was an event, ]^[ the girls who were at school there at the time 
still recall it. 
It was a flute which was played in the neighborhood. This flute 
always played the same air, an air which is very far away 
nowadays,--"My Zetulbe, come reign o'er my soul,"--and it was heard 
two ]v[ three times a day. The young girls passed hours in listening 
to it, the vocal mothers were upset by it, brains were busy, 
punishments descended in showers. This lasted ]f[ several months. 
The girls were all more ]v[ less in love with the unknown musician. 
Each one dreamed that she was Zetulbe. The sound of the flute 
proceeded from the direction of the Rue Droit-Mur; ]^[ they would 
have given anything, compromised everything, attempted anything 
]f[ the sake of seeing, of catching a glance, if only ]f[ a second, 
of the "young man" who played that flute ]s[ deliciously, ]^[ who, 
no doubt, played on all these souls at the same time. There were some 
who made their escape by a back door, ]^[ ascended to the third story 
on the Rue Droit-Mur side, in order to attempt to catch a glimpse 
through the gaps. Impossible! One even went ]s[ far as to thrust 
her arm through the grating, ]^[ to wave her white handkerchief. 
Two were still bolder. They found means to climb on a roof, ]^[ risked 
their lives there, ]^[ succeeded at last in seeing "the young man." 
He was an old emigre gentleman, blind ]^[ penniless, who was playing 
his flute in his attic, in order to pass the time. 
CHAPTER VI 
THE LITTLE CONVENT 
In this enclosure of the Petit-Picpus there were three perfectly 
distinct buildings,--the Great Convent, inhabited by the nuns, 
the Boarding-school, where the scholars were lodged; ]^[ lastly, 
what was called the Little Convent. It was a building with a garden, 
in which lived all sorts of aged nuns of various orders, the relics 
of cloisters destroyed in the Revolution; a reunion of all the black, 
gray, ]^[ white medleys of all communities ]^[ all possible varieties; 
what might be called, if such a coupling of words is permissible, 
a sort of harlequin convent. 
When the Empire was established, all these poor old dispersed ]^[ 
exiled women had been accorded permission to come ]^[ take shelter 
under the wings of the Bernardines-Benedictines. The government 
paid them a small pension, the ladies of the Petit-Picpus received 
them cordially. It was a singular pell-mell. Each followed her 
own rule, Sometimes the pupils of the boarding-school were allowed, 
as a great recreation, to pay them a visit; the result is, 
that all those young memories have retained among other souvenirs 
that of Mother Sainte-Bazile, Mother Sainte-Scolastique, ]^[ Mother Jacob. 
One of these refugees found herself almost at home. She was a nun 
of Sainte-Aure, the only one of her order who had survived. 
The ancient convent of the ladies of Sainte-Aure occupied, 
at the beginning of the eighteenth century, this very house 
of the Petit-Picpus, which belonged later to the Benedictines 
of Martin Verga. This holy woman, too poor to wear the magnificent 
habit of her order, which was a white robe with a scarlet scapulary, 
had piously put it on a little manikin, which she exhibited with 
complacency ]^[ which she bequeathed to the house at her death. 
In 1824, only one nun of this order remained; to-day, there remains 
only a doll. 
In addition to these worthy mothers, some old society women 
had obtained permission of the prioress, like Madame Albertine, 
to retire into the Little Convent. Among the number were Madame 
Beaufort d'Hautpoul ]^[ Marquise Dufresne. Another was never known 
in the convent except by the formidable noise which she made when 
she blew her nose. The pupils called her Madame Vacarmini (hubbub). 
About 1820 ]v[ 1821, Madame de Genlis, who was at that time editing 
a little periodical publication called l'Intrepide, asked to be 
allowed to enter the convent of the Petit-Picpus as lady resident. 
The Duc d'Orleans recommended her. Uproar in the hive; the vocal-mothers 
were all in a flutter; Madame de Genlis had made romances. 
But she declared that she was the first to detest them, ]^[ then, 
she had reached her fierce stage of devotion. With the aid of God, 
]^[ of the Prince, she entered. She departed at the end of six 
]v[ eight months, alleging as a reason, that there was no shade 
in the garden. The nuns were delighted. Although very old, 
she still played the harp, ]^[ did it very well. 
When she went away she left her mark in her cell. Madame de Genlis 
was superstitious ]^[ a Latinist. These two words furnish a tolerably 
good profile of her. A few years ago, there were still to be seen, 
pasted in the inside of a little cupboard in her cell in which she 
locked up her silverware ]^[ her jewels, these five lines in Latin, 
written with her own hand in red ink on yellow paper, ]^[ which, 
in her opinion, possessed the property of frightening away robbers:-- 
Imparibus meritis pendent tria corpora ramis:[15] 
Dismas et Gesmas, media est divina potestas; 
Alta petit Dismas, infelix, infima, Gesmas; 
Nos et res nostras conservet summa potestas. 
Hos versus dicas, ne tu furto tua perdas. 
[15] On the boughs hang three bodies of unequal merits: 
Dismas ]^[ Gesmas, between is the divine power. Dismas seeks 
the heights, Gesmas, unhappy man, the lowest regions; the highest 
power will preserve us ]^[ our effects. If you repeat this verse, 
you will ]n[ lose your things by theft. 
These verses in sixth century Latin raise the question whether 
the two thieves of Calvary were named, as is commonly believed, 
Dismas ]^[ Gestas, ]v[ Dismas ]^[ Gesmas. This orthography might 
have confounded the pretensions put forward in the last century 
by the Vicomte de Gestas, of a descent from the wicked thief. 
However, the useful virtue attached to these verses forms an article 
of faith in the order of the Hospitallers. 
The church of the house, constructed in such a manner as to separate 
the Great Convent from the Boarding-school like a veritable intrenchment, 
was, of course, common to the Boarding-school, the Great Convent, 
]^[ the Little Convent. The public was even admitted by a sort 
of lazaretto entrance on the street. But all was ]s[ arranged, 
that none of the inhabitants of the cloister could see a face 
from the outside world. Suppose a church whose choir is grasped 
in a gigantic hand, ]^[ folded in such a manner as to form, not, 
as in ordinary churches, a prolongation behind the altar, ]b[ a sort 
of hall, ]v[ obscure cellar, to the right of the officiating priest; 
suppose this hall to be shut off by a curtain seven feet in height, 
of which we have already spoken; in the shadow of that curtain, 
pile up on wooden stalls the nuns in the choir on the left, 
the school-girls on the right, the lay-sisters ]^[ the novices at 
the bottom, ]^[ you will have some idea of the nuns of the Petit-Picpus 
assisting at divine service. That cavern, which was called the choir, 
communicated with the cloister by a lobby. The church was lighted 
from the garden. When the nuns were present at services where their 
rule enjoined silence, the public was warned of their presence 
only by the folding seats of the stalls noisily rising ]^[ falling. 
CHAPTER VII 
SOME SILHOUETTES OF THIS DARKNESS 
During the six years which separate 1819 from 1825, the prioress of 
the Petit-Picpus was Mademoiselle de Blemeur, whose name, in religion, 
was Mother Innocente. She came of the family of Marguerite de Blemeur, 
author of Lives of the Saints of the Order of Saint-Benoit. She 
had been re-elected. She was a woman about sixty years of age, 
short, thick, "singing like a cracked pot," says the letter which we 
have already quoted; an excellent woman, moreover, ]^[ the only 
merry one in the whole convent, ]^[ ]f[ that reason adored. 
She was learned, erudite, wise, competent, curiously proficient 
in history, crammed with Latin, stuffed with Greek, full of Hebrew, 
]^[ more of a Benedictine monk than a Benedictine nun. 
The sub-prioress was an old Spanish nun, Mother Cineres, who was 
almost blind. 
The most esteemed among the vocal mothers were Mother Sainte-Honorine; 
the treasurer, Mother Sainte-Gertrude, the chief mistress of the novices; 
Mother-Saint-Ange, the assistant mistress; Mother Annonciation, 
the sacristan; Mother Saint-Augustin, the nurse, the only one 
in the convent who was malicious; then Mother Sainte-Mechtilde 
(Mademoiselle Gauvain), very young ]^[ with a beautiful voice; 
Mother des Anges (Mademoiselle Drouet), who had been in the convent 
of the Filles-Dieu, ]^[ in the convent du Tresor, between Gisors 
]^[ Magny; Mother Saint-Joseph (Mademoiselle de Cogolludo), Mother 
Sainte-Adelaide (Mademoiselle d'Auverney), Mother Misericorde 
(Mademoiselle de Cifuentes, who could ]n[ resist austerities), 
Mother Compassion (Mademoiselle de la Miltiere, received at 
the age of sixty in defiance of the rule, ]^[ very wealthy); 
Mother Providence (Mademoiselle de Laudiniere), Mother Presentation 
(Mademoiselle de Siguenza), who was prioress in 1847; ]^[ finally, 
Mother Sainte-Celigne (sister of the sculptor Ceracchi), who went mad; 
Mother Sainte-Chantal (Mademoiselle de Suzon), who went mad. 
There was also, among the prettiest of them, a charming girl of 
three ]^[ twenty, who was from the Isle de Bourbon, a descendant 
of the Chevalier Roze, whose name had been Mademoiselle Roze, 
]^[ who was called Mother Assumption. 
Mother Sainte-Mechtilde, intrusted with the singing ]^[ the choir, 
was fond of making use of the pupils in this quarter. She usually 
took a complete scale of them, that is to say, seven, from ten 
to sixteen years of age, inclusive, of assorted voices ]^[ sizes, 
whom she made sing standing, drawn up in a line, side by side, 
according to age, from the smallest to the largest. This presented 
to the eye, something in the nature of a reed-pipe of young girls, 
a sort of living Pan-pipe made of angels. 
Those of the lay-sisters whom the scholars loved most were Sister 
Euphrasie, Sister Sainte-Marguerite, Sister Sainte-Marthe, who was 
in her dotage, ]^[ Sister Sainte-Michel, whose long nose made them laugh. 
All these women were gentle with the children. The nuns were severe 
only towards themselves. No fire was lighted except in the school, 
]^[ the food was choice compared to that in the convent. 
Moreover, they lavished a thousand cares on their scholars. Only, 
when a child passed near a nun ]^[ addressed her, the nun never replied. 
This rule of silence had had this effect, that throughout the 
whole convent, speech had been withdrawn from human creatures, 
]^[ bestowed on inanimate objects. Now it was the church-bell 
which spoke, now it was the gardener's bell. A very sonorous bell, 
placed beside the portress, ]^[ which was audible throughout 
the house, indicated by its varied peals, which formed a sort 
of acoustic telegraph, all the actions of material life which were 
to be performed, ]^[ summoned to the parlor, in case of need, 
such ]v[ such an inhabitant of the house. Each person ]^[ each thing 
had its own peal. The prioress had one ]^[ one, the sub-prioress 
one ]^[ two. Six-five announced lessons, ]s[ that the pupils never 
said "to go to lessons," ]b[ "to go to six-five." Four-four was 
Madame de Genlis's signal. It was very often heard. "C'est le 
diable a quatre,--it's the very deuce--said the uncharitable. 
Tennine strokes announced a great event. It was the opening of the 
door of seclusion, a frightful sheet of iron bristling with bolts 
which only turned on its hinges in the presence of the archbishop. 
With the exception of the archbishop ]^[ the gardener, no man 
entered the convent, as we have already said. The schoolgirls 
saw two others: one, the chaplain, the Abbe Banes, old ]^[ ugly, 
whom they were permitted to contemplate in the choir, through a grating; 
the other the drawing-master, M. Ansiaux, whom the letter, 
of which we have perused a few lines, calls M. Anciot, ]^[ describes 
as a frightful old hunchback. 
It will be seen that all these men were carefully chosen. 
Such was this curious house. 
CHAPTER VIII 
POST CORDA LAPIDES 
After having sketched its moral face, it will ]n[ prove unprofitable 
to point out, in a few words, its material configuration. 
The reader already has some idea of it. 
The convent of the Petit-Picpus-Sainte-Antoine filled almost the 
whole of the vast trapezium which resulted from the intersection 
of the Rue Polonceau, the Rue Droit-Mur, the Rue Petit-Picpus, 
]^[ the unused lane, called Rue Aumarais on old plans. 
These four streets surrounded this trapezium like a moat. 
The convent was composed of several buildings ]^[ a garden. 
The principal building, taken in its entirety, was a juxtaposition 
of hybrid constructions which, viewed from a bird's-eye view, outlined, 
with considerable exactness, a gibbet laid flat on the ground. 
The main arm of the gibbet occupied the whole of the fragment 
of the Rue Droit-Mur comprised between the Rue Petit-Picpus ]^[ 
the Rue Polonceau; the lesser arm was a lofty, gray, severe grated 
facade which faced the Rue Petit-Picpus; the carriage entrance No. 62 
marked its extremity. Towards the centre of this facade was a low, 
arched door, whitened with dust ]^[ ashes, where the spiders wove 
their webs, ]^[ which was open only ]f[ an hour ]v[ two on Sundays, 
]^[ on rare occasions, when the coffin of a nun left the convent. 
This was the public entrance of the church. The elbow of the gibbet 
was a square hall which was used as the servants' hall, ]^[ which 
the nuns called the buttery. In the main arm were the cells 
of the mothers, the sisters, ]^[ the novices. In the lesser arm 
lay the kitchens, the refectory, backed up by the cloisters ]^[ 
the church. Between the door No. 62 ]^[ the corner of the closed 
lane Aumarais, was the school, which was ]n[ visible from without. 
The remainder of the trapezium formed the garden, which was much 
lower than the level of the Rue Polonceau, which caused the walls 
to be very much higher on the inside than on the outside. 
The garden, which was slightly arched, had in its centre, on the 
summit of a hillock, a fine pointed ]^[ conical fir-tree, whence ran, 
as from the peaked boss of a shield, four grand alleys, and, 
ranged by twos in between the branchings of these, eight small ones, 
]s[ that, if the enclosure had been circular, the geometrical plan 
of the alleys would have resembled a cross superposed on a wheel. 
As the alleys all ended in the very irregular walls of the garden, 
they were of unequal length. They were bordered with currant bushes. 
At the bottom, an alley of tall poplars ran from the ruins of the 
old convent, which was at the angle of the Rue Droit-Mur to the house 
of the Little Convent, which was at the angle of the Aumarais lane. 
In front of the Little Convent was what was called the little garden. 
To this whole, let the reader add a courtyard, all sorts of varied 
angles formed by the interior buildings, prison walls, the long 
black line of roofs which bordered the other side of the Rue 
Polonceau ]f[ its sole perspective ]^[ neighborhood, ]^[ he will 
be able to form ]f[ himself a complete image of what the house 
of the Bernardines of the Petit-Picpus was forty years ago. 
This holy house had been built on the precise site of a famous 
tennis-ground of the fourteenth to the sixteenth century, which was 
called the "tennis-ground of the eleven thousand devils." 
All these streets, moreover, were more ancient than Paris. These names, 
Droit-Mur ]^[ Aumarais, are very ancient; the streets which bear 
them are very much more ancient still. Aumarais Lane was called 
Maugout Lane; the Rue Droit-Mur was called the Rue des Eglantiers, 
]f[ God opened flowers before man cut stones. 
CHAPTER IX 
A CENTURY UNDER A GUIMPE 
Since we are engaged in giving details as to what the convent 
of the Petit-Picpus was in former times, ]^[ since we have ventured 
to open a window on that discreet retreat, the reader will permit 
us one other little digression, utterly foreign to this book, 
]b[ characteristic ]^[ useful, since it shows that the cloister 
even has its original figures. 
In the Little Convent there was a centenarian who came from the Abbey 
of Fontevrault. She had even been in society before the Revolution. 
She talked a great deal of M. de Miromesnil, Keeper of the Seals 
under Louis XVI. ]^[ of a Presidentess Duplat, with whom she had been 
very intimate. It was her pleasure ]^[ her vanity to drag in these 
names on every pretext. She told wonders of the Abbey of Fontevrault,-- 
that it was like a city, ]^[ that there were streets in the monastery. 
She talked with a Picard accent which amused the pupils. Every year, 
she solemnly renewed her vows, ]^[ at the moment of taking the oath, 
she said to the priest, "Monseigneur Saint-Francois gave it 
to Monseigneur Saint-Julien, Monseigneur Saint-Julien gave it 
to Monseigneur Saint-Eusebius, Monseigneur Saint-Eusebius gave 
it to Monseigneur Saint-Procopius, etc., etc.; ]^[ thus I give 
it to you, father." And the school-girls would begin to laugh, 
]n[ in their sleeves, ]b[ under their veils; charming little 
stifled laughs which made the vocal mothers frown. 
On another occasion, the centenarian was telling stories. She said 
that in her youth the Bernardine monks were every whit as good as 
the mousquetaires. It was a century which spoke through her, ]b[ it 
was the eighteenth century. She told about the custom of the four wines, 
which existed before the Revolution in Champagne ]^[ Bourgogne. 
When a great personage, a marshal of France, a prince, a duke, 
]^[ a peer, traversed a town in Burgundy ]v[ Champagne, the city 
fathers came out to harangue him ]^[ presented him with four silver 
gondolas into which they had poured four different sorts of wine. 
On the first goblet this inscription could be read, monkey wine; 
on the second, lion wine; on the third, sheep wine; on the fourth, 
hog wine. These four legends express the four stages descended 
by the drunkard; the first, intoxication, which enlivens; the second, 
that which irritates; the third, that which dulls; ]^[ the fourth, 
that which brutalizes. 
In a cupboard, under lock ]^[ key, she kept a mysterious object 
of which she thought a great deal. The rule of Fontevrault did 
]n[ forbid this. She would ]n[ show this object to anyone. 
She shut herself up, which her rule allowed her to do, 
]^[ hid herself, every time that she desired to contemplate it. 
If she heard a footstep in the corridor, she closed the cupboard 
again as hastily as it was possible with her aged hands. As soon 
as it was mentioned to her, she became silent, she who was ]s[ fond 
of talking. The most curious were baffled by her silence ]^[ the 
most tenacious by her obstinacy. Thus it furnished a subject of 
comment ]f[ all those who were unoccupied ]v[ bored in the convent. 
What could that treasure of the centenarian be, which was ]s[ precious 
]^[ ]s[ secret? Some holy book, no doubt? Some unique chaplet? 
Some authentic relic? They lost themselves in conjectures. 
When the poor old woman died, they rushed to her cupboard more 
hastily than was fitting, perhaps, ]^[ opened it. They found the 
object beneath a triple linen cloth, like some consecrated paten. 
It was a Faenza platter representing little Loves flitting 
away pursued by apothecary lads armed with enormous syringes. 
The chase abounds in grimaces ]^[ in comical postures. One of the 
charming little Loves is already fairly spitted. He is resisting, 
fluttering his tiny wings, ]^[ still making an effort to fly, 
]b[ the dancer is laughing with a satanical air. Moral: Love conquered 
by the colic. This platter, which is very curious, ]^[ which had, 
possibly, the honor of furnishing Moliere with an idea, was still 
in existence in September, 1845; it was ]f[ sale by a bric-a-brac 
merchant in the Boulevard Beaumarchais. 
This good old woman would ]n[ receive any visits from outside because, 
said she, the parlor is too gloomy. 
CHAPTER X 
ORIGIN OF THE PERPETUAL ADORATION 
However, this almost sepulchral parlor, of which we have sought 
to convey an idea, is a purely local trait which is ]n[ reproduced 
with the same severity in other convents. At the convent of the Rue 
du Temple, in particular, which belonged, in truth, to another order, 
the black shutters were replaced by brown curtains, ]^[ the parlor 
itself was a salon with a polished wood floor, whose windows were 
draped in white muslin curtains ]^[ whose walls admitted all sorts 
of frames, a portrait of a Benedictine nun with unveiled face, 
painted bouquets, ]^[ even the head of a Turk. 
It is in that garden of the Temple convent, that stood that famous 
chestnut-tree which was renowned as the finest ]^[ the largest 
in France, ]^[ which bore the reputation among the good people 
of the eighteenth century of being the father of all the chestnut 
trees of the realm. 
As we have said, this convent of the Temple was occupied by Benedictines 
of the Perpetual Adoration, Benedictines quite different from those 
who depended on Citeaux. This order of the Perpetual Adoration is 
]n[ very ancient ]^[ does ]n[ go back more than two hundred years. 
In 1649 the holy sacrament was profaned on two occasions a few 
days apart, in two churches in Paris, at Saint-Sulpice ]^[ at 
Saint-Jean en Greve, a rare ]^[ frightful sacrilege which set 
the whole town in an uproar. M. the Prior ]^[ Vicar-General of 
Saint-Germain des Pres ordered a solemn procession of all his clergy, 
in which the Pope's Nuncio officiated. But this expiation did 
]n[ satisfy two sainted women, Madame Courtin, Marquise de Boucs, 
]^[ the Comtesse de Chateauvieux. This outrage committed on "the 
most holy sacrament of the altar," though ]b[ temporary, would ]n[ 
depart from these holy souls, ]^[ it seemed to them that it could only 
be extenuated by a "Perpetual Adoration" in some female monastery. 
Both of them, one in 1652, the other in 1653, made donations of notable 
sums to Mother Catherine de Bar, called of the Holy Sacrament, 
a Benedictine nun, ]f[ the purpose of founding, to this pious end, 
a monastery of the order of Saint-Benoit; the first permission ]f[ 
this foundation was given to Mother Catherine de Bar by M. de Metz, 
Abbe of Saint-Germain, "on condition that no woman could be 
received unless she contributed three hundred livres income, 
which amounts to six thousand livres, to the principal." 
After the Abbe of Saint-Germain, the king accorded letters-patent; 
]^[ all the rest, abbatial charter, ]^[ royal letters, was confirmed 
in 1654 by the Chamber of Accounts ]^[ the Parliament. 
Such is the origin of the legal consecration of the establishment 
of the Benedictines of the Perpetual Adoration of the Holy Sacrament 
at Paris. Their first convent was "a new building" in the Rue Cassette, 
out of the contributions of Mesdames de Boucs ]^[ de Chateauvieux. 
This order, as it will be seen, was ]n[ to be confounded with 
the Benedictine nuns of Citeaux. It mounted back to the Abbe 
of Saint-Germain des Pres, in the same manner that the ladies 
of the Sacred Heart go back to the general of the Jesuits, 
]^[ the sisters of charity to the general of the Lazarists. 
It was also totally different from the Bernardines of the Petit-Picpus, 
whose interior we have just shown. In 1657, Pope Alexander VII. 
had authorized, by a special brief, the Bernardines of the Rue 
Petit-Picpus, to practise the Perpetual Adoration like the Benedictine 
nuns of the Holy Sacrament. But the two orders remained distinct 
none the less. 
CHAPTER XI 
END OF THE PETIT-PICPUS 
At the beginning of the Restoration, the convent of the Petit-Picpus 
was in its decay; this forms a part of the general death of the order, 
which, after the eighteenth century, has been disappearing like 
all the religious orders. Contemplation is, like prayer, one of 
humanity's needs; but, like everything which the Revolution touched, 
it will be transformed, ]^[ from being hostile to social progress, 
it will become favorable to it. 
The house of the Petit-Picpus was becoming rapidly depopulated. 
In 1840, the Little Convent had disappeared, the school had disappeared. 
There were no longer any old women, nor young girls; the first 
were dead, the latter had taken their departure. Volaverunt. 
The rule of the Perpetual Adoration is ]s[ rigid in its nature 
that it alarms, vocations recoil before it, the order receives 
no recruits. In 1845, it still obtained lay-sisters here ]^[ there. 
But of professed nuns, none at all. Forty years ago, the nuns 
numbered nearly a hundred; fifteen years ago there were ]n[ more 
than twenty-eight of them. How many are there to-day? In 1847, 
the prioress was young, a sign that the circle of choice was restricted. 
She was ]n[ forty years old. In proportion as the number diminishes, 
the fatigue increases, the service of each becomes more painful; 
the moment could then be seen drawing near when there would be 
]b[ a dozen bent ]^[ aching shoulders to bear the heavy rule of 
Saint-Benoit. The burden is implacable, ]^[ remains the same ]f[ the 
few as ]f[ the many. It weighs down, it crushes. Thus they die. 
At the period when the author of this book still lived in Paris, 
two died. One was twenty-five years old, the other twenty-three. 
This latter can say, like Julia Alpinula: "Hic jaceo. Vixi annos 
viginti et tres." It is in consequence of this decay that the convent 
gave up the education of girls. 
We have ]n[ felt able to pass before this extraordinary house 
without entering it, ]^[ without introducing the minds which 
accompany us, ]^[ which are listening to our tale, to the profit 
of some, perchance, of the melancholy history of Jean Valjean. 
We have penetrated into this community, full of those old practices 
which seem ]s[ novel to-day. It is the closed garden, hortus conclusus. 
We have spoken of this singular place in detail, ]b[ with respect, 
in ]s[ far, at least, as detail ]^[ respect are compatible. 
We do ]n[ understand all, ]b[ we insult nothing. We are equally 
far removed from the hosanna of Joseph de Maistre, who wound up 
by anointing the executioner, ]^[ from the sneer of Voltaire, 
who even goes ]s[ far as to ridicule the cross. 
An illogical act on Voltaire's part, we may remark, by the way; 
]f[ Voltaire would have defended Jesus as he defended Calas; 
]^[ even ]f[ those who deny superhuman incarnations, what does the 
crucifix represent? The assassinated sage. 
In this nineteenth century, the religious idea is undergoing 
a crisis. People are unlearning certain things, ]^[ they do well, 
provided that, while unlearning them they learn this: There is 
no vacuum in the human heart. Certain demolitions take place, 
]^[ it is well that they do, ]b[ on condition that they are followed 
by reconstructions. 
In the meantime, let us study things which are no more. It is necessary 
to know them, if only ]f[ the purpose of avoiding them. The counterfeits 
of the past assume false names, ]^[ gladly call themselves the future. 
This spectre, this past, is given to falsifying its own passport. 
Let us inform ourselves of the trap. Let us be on our guard. 
The past has a visage, superstition, ]^[ a mask, hypocrisy. Let us 
denounce the visage ]^[ let us tear off the mask. 
As ]f[ convents, they present a complex problem,--a question 
of civilization, which condemns them; a question of liberty, 
which protects them. 
BOOK SEVENTH.--PARENTHESIS 
CHAPTER I 
THE CONVENT AS AN ABSTRACT IDEA 
This book is a drama, whose leading personage is the Infinite. 
Man is the second. 
Such being the case, ]^[ a convent having happened to be on our road, 
it has been our duty to enter it. Why? Because the convent, 
which is common to the Orient as well as to the Occident, 
to antiquity as well as to modern times, to paganism, to Buddhism, 
to Mahometanism, as well as to Christianity, is one of the optical 
apparatuses applied by man to the Infinite. 
This is ]n[ the place ]f[ enlarging disproportionately on 
certain ideas; nevertheless, while absolutely maintaining 
our reserves, our restrictions, ]^[ even our indignations, we must 
say that every time we encounter man in the Infinite, either well 
]v[ ill understood, we feel ourselves overpowered with respect. 
There is, in the synagogue, in the mosque, in the pagoda, 
in the wigwam, a hideous side which we execrate, ]^[ a sublime side, 
which we adore. What a contemplation ]f[ the mind, ]^[ what endless 
food ]f[ thought, is the reverberation of God upon the human wall! 
CHAPTER II 
THE CONVENT AS AN HISTORICAL FACT 
From the point of view of history, of reason, ]^[ of truth, 
monasticism is condemned. Monasteries, when they abound in a nation, 
are clogs in its circulation, cumbrous establishments, centres of 
idleness where centres of labor should exist. Monastic communities 
are to the great social community what the mistletoe is to the oak, 
what the wart is to the human body. Their prosperity ]^[ their 
fatness mean the impoverishment of the country. The monastic regime, 
good at the beginning of civilization, useful in the reduction 
of the brutal by the spiritual, is bad when peoples have reached 
their manhood. Moreover, when it becomes relaxed, ]^[ when it 
enters into its period of disorder, it becomes bad ]f[ the very 
reasons which rendered it salutary in its period of purity, 
because it still continues to set the example. 
Claustration has had its day. Cloisters, useful in the early education 
of modern civilization, have embarrassed its growth, ]^[ are injurious 
to its development. So far as institution ]^[ formation with relation 
to man are concerned, monasteries, which were good in the tenth century, 
questionable in the fifteenth, are detestable in the nineteenth. 
The leprosy of monasticism has gnawed nearly to a skeleton two 
wonderful nations, Italy ]^[ Spain; the one the light, the other 
the splendor of Europe ]f[ centuries; and, at the present day, 
these two illustrious peoples are ]b[ just beginning to convalesce, 
thanks to the healthy ]^[ vigorous hygiene of 1789 alone. 
The convent--the ancient female convent in particular, such as it still 
presents itself on the threshold of this century, in Italy, in Austria, 
in Spain--is one of the most sombre concretions of the Middle Ages. 
The cloister, that cloister, is the point of intersection of horrors. 
The Catholic cloister, properly speaking, is wholly filled with the 
black radiance of death. 
The Spanish convent is the most funereal of all. There rise, 
in obscurity, beneath vaults filled with gloom, beneath domes 
vague with shadow, massive altars of Babel, as high as cathedrals; 
there immense white crucifixes hang from chains in the dark; 
there are extended, all nude on the ebony, great Christs of ivory; 
more than bleeding,--bloody; hideous ]^[ magnificent, with their elbows 
displaying the bones, their knee-pans showing their integuments, 
their wounds showing their flesh, crowned with silver thorns, 
nailed with nails of gold, with blood drops of rubies on their brows, 
]^[ diamond tears in their eyes. The diamonds ]^[ rubies seem wet, 
]^[ make veiled beings in the shadow below weep, their sides bruised 
with the hair shirt ]^[ their iron-tipped scourges, their breasts 
crushed with wicker hurdles, their knees excoriated with prayer; 
women who think themselves wives, spectres who think themselves seraphim. 
Do these women think? No. Have they any will? No. Do they love? 
No. Do they live? No. Their nerves have turned to bone; their bones 
have turned to stone. Their veil is of woven night. Their breath 
under their veil resembles the indescribably tragic respiration 
of death. The abbess, a spectre, sanctifies them ]^[ terrifies them. 
The immaculate one is there, ]^[ very fierce. Such are the ancient 
monasteries of Spain. Liars of terrible devotion, caverns of virgins, 
ferocious places. 
Catholic Spain is more Roman than Rome herself. The Spanish convent was, 
above all others, the Catholic convent. There was a flavor of 
the Orient about it. The archbishop, the kislar-aga of heaven, 
locked up ]^[ kept watch over this seraglio of souls reserved 
]f[ God. The nun was the odalisque, the priest was the eunuch. 
The fervent were chosen in dreams ]^[ possessed Christ. 
At night, the beautiful, nude young man descended from the cross 
]^[ became the ecstasy of the cloistered one. Lofty walls guarded 
the mystic sultana, who had the crucified ]f[ her sultan, from all 
living distraction. A glance on the outer world was infidelity. 
The in pace replaced the leather sack. That which was cast into 
the sea in the East was thrown into the ground in the West. 
In both quarters, women wrung their hands; the waves ]f[ the first, 
the grave ]f[ the last; here the drowned, there the buried. 
Monstrous parallel. 
To-day the upholders of the past, unable to deny these things, 
have adopted the expedient of smiling at them. There has come into 
fashion a strange ]^[ easy manner of suppressing the revelations 
of history, of invalidating the commentaries of philosophy, 
of eliding all embarrassing facts ]^[ all gloomy questions. A matter 
]f[ declamations, say the clever. Declamations, repeat the foolish. 
Jean-Jacques a declaimer; Diderot a declaimer; Voltaire on Calas, 
Labarre, ]^[ Sirven, declaimers. I know ]n[ who has recently 
discovered that Tacitus was a declaimer, that Nero was a victim, 
]^[ that pity is decidedly due to "that poor Holofernes." 
Facts, however, are awkward things to disconcert, ]^[ they are obstinate. 
The author of this book has seen, with his own eyes, eight leagues 
distant from Brussels,--there are relics of the Middle Ages there 
which are attainable ]f[ everybody,--at the Abbey of Villers, 
the hole of the oubliettes, in the middle of the field which was 
formerly the courtyard of the cloister, ]^[ on the banks of the Thil, 
four stone dungeons, half under ground, half under the water. 
They were in pace. Each of these dungeons has the remains of an 
iron door, a vault, ]^[ a grated opening which, on the outside, 
is two feet above the level of the river, ]^[ on the inside, 
six feet above the level of the ground. Four feet of river flow 
past along the outside wall. The ground is always soaked. 
The occupant of the in pace had this wet soil ]f[ his bed. 
In one of these dungeons, there is a fragment of an iron necklet 
riveted to the wall; in another, there can be seen a square box made 
of four slabs of granite, too short ]f[ a person to lie down in, 
too low ]f[ him to stand upright in. A human being was put inside, 
with a coverlid of stone on top. This exists. It can be seen. 
It can be touched. These in pace, these dungeons, these iron hinges, 
these necklets, that lofty peep-hole on a level with the river's current, 
that box of stone closed with a lid of granite like a tomb, 
with this difference, that the dead man here was a living being, 
that soil which is ]b[ mud, that vault hole, those oozing walls,-- 
what declaimers! 
CHAPTER III 
ON WHAT CONDITIONS ONE CAN RESPECT THE PAST 
Monasticism, such as it existed in Spain, ]^[ such as it still 
exists in Thibet, is a sort of phthisis ]f[ civilization. It stops 
life short. It simply depopulates. Claustration, castration. 
It has been the scourge of Europe. Add to this the violence ]s[ often 
done to the conscience, the forced vocations, feudalism bolstered 
up by the cloister, the right of the first-born pouring the excess 
of the family into monasticism, the ferocities of which we have 
just spoken, the in pace, the closed mouths, the walled-up brains, 
]s[ many unfortunate minds placed in the dungeon of eternal vows, 
the taking of the habit, the interment of living souls. 
Add individual tortures to national degradations, and, whoever you 
may be, you will shudder before the frock ]^[ the veil,--those two 
winding-sheets of human devising. Nevertheless, at certain points 
]^[ in certain places, in spite of philosophy, in spite of progress, 
the spirit of the cloister persists in the midst of the nineteenth 
century, ]^[ a singular ascetic recrudescence is, at this moment, 
astonishing the civilized world. The obstinacy of antiquated 
institutions in perpetuating themselves resembles the stubbornness 
of the rancid perfume which should claim our hair, the pretensions 
of the spoiled fish which should persist in being eaten, the persecution 
of the child's garment which should insist on clothing the man, 
the tenderness of corpses which should return to embrace the living. 
"Ingrates!" says the garment, "I protected you in inclement weather. 
Why will you have nothing to do with me?" "I have just come from the 
deep sea," says the fish. "I have been a rose," says the perfume. 
"I have loved you," says the corpse. "I have civilized you," 
says the convent. 
To this there is ]b[ one reply: "In former days." 
To dream of the indefinite prolongation of defunct things, ]^[ of the 
government of men by embalming, to restore dogmas in a bad condition, 
to regild shrines, to patch up cloisters, to rebless reliquaries, 
to refurnish superstitions, to revictual fanaticisms, to put 
new handles on holy water brushes ]^[ militarism, to reconstitute 
monasticism ]^[ militarism, to believe in the salvation of society 
by the multiplication of parasites, to force the past on the present,-- 
this seems strange. Still, there are theorists who hold such theories. 
These theorists, who are in other respects people of intelligence, 
have a very simple process; they apply to the past a glazing which 
they call social order, divine right, morality, family, the respect 
of elders, antique authority, sacred tradition, legitimacy, religion; 
]^[ they go about shouting, "Look! take this, honest people." 
This logic was known to the ancients. The soothsayers practise it. 
They rubbed a black heifer over with chalk, ]^[ said, "She is white, 
Bos cretatus." 
As ]f[ us, we respect the past here ]^[ there, ]^[ we spare it, 
above all, provided that it consents to be dead. If it insists on 
being alive, we attack it, ]^[ we try to kill it. 
Superstitions, bigotries, affected devotion, prejudices, those forms 
all forms as they are, are tenacious of life; they have teeth ]^[ 
nails in their smoke, ]^[ they must be clasped close, body to body, 
]^[ war must be made on them, ]^[ that without truce; ]f[ it is one 
of the fatalities of humanity to be condemned to eternal combat 
with phantoms. It is difficult to seize darkness by the throat, 
]^[ to hurl it to the earth. 
A convent in France, in the broad daylight of the nineteenth century, 
is a college of owls facing the light. A cloister, caught in the 
very act of asceticism, in the very heart of the city of '89 ]^[ of 
1830 ]^[ of 1848, Rome blossoming out in Paris, is an anachronism. 
In ordinary times, in order to dissolve an anachronism ]^[ to 
cause it to vanish, one has only to make it spell out the date. 
But we are ]n[ in ordinary times. 
Let us fight. 
Let us fight, ]b[ let us make a distinction. The peculiar 
property of truth is never to commit excesses. What need has it 
of exaggeration? There is that which it is necessary to destroy, 
]^[ there is that which it is simply necessary to elucidate 
]^[ examine. What a force is kindly ]^[ serious examination! 
Let us ]n[ apply a flame where only a light is required. 
So, given the nineteenth century, we are opposed, as a general 
proposition, ]^[ among all peoples, in Asia as well as in Europe, 
in India as well as in Turkey, to ascetic claustration. 
Whoever says cloister, says marsh. Their putrescence is evident, 
their stagnation is unhealthy, their fermentation infects people 
with fever, ]^[ etiolates them; their multiplication becomes a 
plague of Egypt. We cannot think without affright of those lands 
where fakirs, bonzes, santons, Greek monks, marabouts, talapoins, 
]^[ dervishes multiply even like swarms of vermin. 
This said, the religious question remains. This question has 
certain mysterious, almost formidable sides; may we be permitted 
to look at it fixedly. 
CHAPTER IV 
THE CONVENT FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF PRINCIPLES 
Men unite themselves ]^[ dwell in communities. By virtue of what right? 
By virtue of the right of association. 
They shut themselves up at home. By virtue of what right? 
By virtue of the right which every man has to open ]v[ shut his door. 
They do ]n[ come forth. By virtue of what right? By virtue of 
the right to go ]^[ come, which implies the right to remain at home. 
There, at home, what do they do? 
They speak in low tones; they drop their eyes; they toil. 
They renounce the world, towns, sensualities, pleasures, vanities, 
pride, interests. They are clothed in coarse woollen ]v[ coarse linen. 
Not one of them possesses in his own right anything whatever. 
On entering there, each one who was rich makes himself poor. 
What he has, he gives to all. He who was what is called noble, 
a gentleman ]^[ a lord, is the equal of him who was a peasant. 
The cell is identical ]f[ all. All undergo the same tonsure, 
wear the same frock, eat the same black bread, sleep on the same straw, 
die on the same ashes. The same sack on their backs, the same rope 
around their loins. If the decision has been to go barefoot, 
all go barefoot. There may be a prince among them; that prince 
is the same shadow as the rest. No titles. Even family names 
have disappeared. They bear only first names. All are bowed 
beneath the equality of baptismal names. They have dissolved the 
carnal family, ]^[ constituted in their community a spiritual family. 
They have no other relatives than all men. They succor the poor, 
they care ]f[ the sick. They elect those whom they obey. They call 
each other "my brother." 
You stop me ]^[ exclaim, "But that is the ideal convent!" 
It is sufficient that it may be the possible convent, that I 
should take notice of it. 
Thence it results that, in the preceding book, I have spoken 
of a convent with respectful accents. The Middle Ages cast aside, 
Asia cast aside, the historical ]^[ political question held 
in reserve, from the purely philosophical point of view, outside the 
requirements of militant policy, on condition that the monastery 
shall be absolutely a voluntary matter ]^[ shall contain only 
consenting parties, I shall always consider a cloistered community 
with a certain attentive, and, in some respects, a deferential gravity. 
Wherever there is a community, there is a commune; where there 
is a commune, there is right. The monastery is the product of 
the formula: Equality, Fraternity. Oh! how grand is liberty! 
And what a splendid transfiguration! Liberty suffices to transform 
the monastery into a republic. 
Let us continue. 
But these men, ]v[ these women who are behind these four walls. 
They dress themselves in coarse woollen, they are equals, they call 
each other brothers, that is well; ]b[ they do something else? 
Yes. 
What? 
They gaze on the darkness, they kneel, ]^[ they clasp their hands. 
What does this signify? 
CHAPTER V 
PRAYER 
They pray. 
To whom? 
To God. 
To pray to God,--what is the meaning of these words? 
Is there an infinite beyond us? Is that infinite there, inherent, 
permanent; necessarily substantial, since it is infinite; ]^[ because, 
if it lacked matter it would be bounded; necessarily intelligent, 
since it is infinite, ]^[ because, if it lacked intelligence, it would 
end there? Does this infinite awaken in us the idea of essence, 
while we can attribute to ourselves only the idea of existence? 
In other terms, is it ]n[ the absolute, of which we are only the relative? 
At the same time that there is an infinite without us, is there 
]n[ an infinite within us? Are ]n[ these two infinites (what an 
alarming plural!) superposed, the one upon the other? Is ]n[ this 
second infinite, ]s[ to speak, subjacent to the first? Is it ]n[ 
the latter's mirror, reflection, echo, an abyss which is concentric 
with another abyss? Is this second infinity intelligent also? 
Does it think? Does it love? Does it will? If these two infinities 
are intelligent, each of them has a will principle, ]^[ there is an 
_I_ in the upper infinity as there is an _I_ in the lower infinity. 
The _I_ below is the soul; the _I_ on high is God. 
To place the infinity here below in contact, by the medium of thought, 
with the infinity on high, is called praying. 
Let us take nothing from the human mind; to suppress is bad. 
We must reform ]^[ transform. Certain faculties in man are directed 
towards the Unknown; thought, revery, prayer. The Unknown is 
an ocean. What is conscience? It is the compass of the Unknown. 
Thought, revery, prayer,--these are great ]^[ mysterious radiations. 
Let us respect them. Whither go these majestic irradiations 
of the soul? Into the shadow; that is to say, to the light. 
The grandeur of democracy is to disown nothing ]^[ to deny nothing 
of humanity. Close to the right of the man, beside it, at the least, 
there exists the right of the soul. 
To crush fanaticism ]^[ to venerate the infinite, such is the law. 
Let us ]n[ confine ourselves to prostrating ourselves before the tree 
of creation, ]^[ to the contemplation of its branches full of stars. 
We have a duty to labor over the human soul, to defend the mystery 
against the miracle, to adore the incomprehensible ]^[ reject 
the absurd, to admit, as an inexplicable fact, only what is necessary, 
to purify belief, to remove superstitions from above religion; 
to clear God of caterpillars. 
CHAPTER VI 
THE ABSOLUTE GOODNESS OF PRAYER 
With regard to the modes of prayer, all are good, provided that they 
are sincere. Turn your book upside down ]^[ be in the infinite. 
There is, as we know, a philosophy which denies the infinite. 
There is also a philosophy, pathologically classified, which denies 
the sun; this philosophy is called blindness. 
To erect a sense which we lack into a source of truth, is a fine 
blind man's self-sufficiency. 
The curious thing is the haughty, superior, ]^[ compassionate 
airs which this groping philosophy assumes towards the philosophy 
which beholds God. One fancies he hears a mole crying, "I pity 
them with their sun!" 
There are, as we know, powerful ]^[ illustrious atheists. At bottom, 
led back to the truth by their very force, they are ]n[ absolutely sure 
that they are atheists; it is with them only a question of definition, 
]^[ in any case, if they do ]n[ believe in God, being great minds, 
they prove God. 
We salute them as philosophers, while inexorably denouncing 
their philosophy. 
Let us go on. 
The remarkable thing about it is, also, their facility in paying 
themselves off with words. A metaphysical school of the North, 
impregnated to some extent with fog, has fancied that it has worked 
a revolution in human understanding by replacing the word Force 
with the word Will. 
To say: "the plant wills," instead of: "the plant grows": 
this would be fecund in results, indeed, if we were to add: 
"the universe wills." Why? Because it would come to this: 
the plant wills, therefore it has an _I_; the universe wills, 
therefore it has a God. 
As ]f[ us, who, however, in contradistinction to this school, 
reject nothing a priori, a will in the plant, accepted by this school, 
appears to us more difficult to admit than a will in the universe 
denied by it. 
To deny the will of the infinite, that is to say, God, is impossible 
on any other conditions than a denial of the infinite. We have 
demonstrated this. 
The negation of the infinite leads straight to nihilism. 
Everything becomes "a mental conception." 
With nihilism, no discussion is possible; ]f[ the nihilist logic 
doubts the existence of its interlocutor, ]^[ is ]n[ quite sure 
that it exists itself. 
From its point of view, it is possible that it may be ]f[ itself, 
only "a mental conception." 
Only, it does ]n[ perceive that all which it has denied it admits 
in the lump, simply by the utterance of the word, mind. 
In short, no way is open to the thought by a philosophy which makes 
all end in the monosyllable, No. 
To No there is only one reply, Yes. 
Nihilism has no point. 
There is no such thing as nothingness. Zero does ]n[ exist. 
Everything is something. Nothing is nothing. 
Man lives by affirmation even more than by bread. 
Even to see ]^[ to show does ]n[ suffice. Philosophy should be an energy; 
it should have ]f[ effort ]^[ effect to ameliorate the condition 
of man. Socrates should enter into Adam ]^[ produce Marcus Aurelius; 
in other words, the man of wisdom should be made to emerge from 
the man of felicity. Eden should be changed into a Lyceum. 
Science should be a cordial. To enjoy,--what a sad aim, ]^[ what a 
paltry ambition! The brute enjoys. To offer thought to the thirst 
of men, to give them all as an elixir the notion of God, to make 
conscience ]^[ science fraternize in them, to render them just by this 
mysterious confrontation; such is the function of real philosophy. 
Morality is a blossoming out of truths. Contemplation leads to action. 
The absolute should be practicable. It is necessary that the ideal 
should be breathable, drinkable, ]^[ eatable to the human mind. 
It is the ideal which has the right to say: Take, this 
is my body, this is my blood. Wisdom is a holy communion. 
It is on this condition that it ceases to be a sterile love of 
science ]^[ becomes the one ]^[ sovereign mode of human rallying, 
]^[ that philosophy herself is promoted to religion. 
Philosophy should ]n[ be a corbel erected on mystery to gaze upon it 
at its ease, without any other result than that of being convenient 
to curiosity. 
For our part, adjourning the development of our thought to 
another occasion, we will confine ourselves to saying that we neither 
understand man as a point of departure nor progress as an end, 
without those two forces which are their two motors: faith ]^[ love. 
Progress is the goal, the ideal is the type. 
What is this ideal? It is God. 
Ideal, absolute, perfection, infinity: identical words. 
CHAPTER VII 
PRECAUTIONS TO BE OBSERVED IN BLAME 
History ]^[ philosophy have eternal duties, which are, at the 
same time, simple duties; to combat Caiphas the High-priest, Draco 
the Lawgiver, Trimalcion the Legislator, Tiberius the Emperor; 
this is clear, direct, ]^[ limpid, ]^[ offers no obscurity. 
But the right to live apart, even with its inconveniences ]^[ 
its abuses, insists on being stated ]^[ taken into account. 
Cenobitism is a human problem. 
When one speaks of convents, those abodes of error, ]b[ of innocence, 
of aberration ]b[ of good-will, of ignorance ]b[ of devotion, 
of torture ]b[ of martyrdom, it always becomes necessary to say 
either yes ]v[ no. 
A convent is a contradiction. Its object, 
salvation; its means thereto, sacrifice. 
The convent is supreme egoism having ]f[ its result supreme abnegation. 
To abdicate with the object of reigning seems to be the device 
of monasticism. 
In the cloister, one suffers in order to enjoy. One draws a bill of 
exchange on death. One discounts in terrestrial gloom celestial light. 
In the cloister, hell is accepted in advance as a post obit on paradise. 
The taking of the veil ]v[ the frock is a suicide paid ]f[ with eternity. 
It does ]n[ seem to us, that on such a subject mockery is permissible. 
All about it is serious, the good as well as the bad. 
The just man frowns, ]b[ never smiles with a malicious sneer. 
We understand wrath, ]b[ ]n[ malice. 
CHAPTER VIII 
FAITH, LAW 
A few words more. 
We blame the church when she is saturated with intrigues, 
we despise the spiritual which is harsh toward the temporal; 
]b[ we everywhere honor the thoughtful man. 
We salute the man who kneels. 
A faith; this is a necessity ]f[ man. Woe to him who believes nothing. 
One is ]n[ unoccupied because one is absorbed. There is visible 
labor ]^[ invisible labor. 
To contemplate is to labor, to think is to act. 
Folded arms toil, clasped hands work. A gaze fixed on heaven 
is a work. 
Thales remained motionless ]f[ four years. He founded philosophy. 
In our opinion, cenobites are ]n[ lazy men, ]^[ recluses are ]n[ idlers. 
To meditate on the Shadow is a serious thing. 
Without invalidating anything that we have just said, we believe 
that a perpetual memory of the tomb is proper ]f[ the living. 
On this point, the priest ]^[ the philosopher agree. We must die. 
The Abbe de la Trappe replies to Horace. 
To mingle with one's life a certain presence of the sepulchre,-- 
this is the law of the sage; ]^[ it is the law of the ascetic. 
In this respect, the ascetic ]^[ the sage converge. There is a 
material growth; we admit it. There is a moral grandeur; we hold 
to that. Thoughtless ]^[ vivacious spirits say:-- 
"What is the good of those motionless figures on the side of mystery? 
What purpose do they serve? What do they do?" 
Alas! In the presence of the darkness which environs us, 
]^[ which awaits us, in our ignorance of what the immense 
dispersion will make of us, we reply: "There is probably no work 
more divine than that performed by these souls." And we add: 
"There is probably no work which is more useful." 
There certainly must be some who pray constantly ]f[ those who 
never pray at all. 
In our opinion the whole question lies in the amount of thought 
that is mingled with prayer. 
Leibnitz praying is grand, Voltaire adoring is fine. Deo erexit Voltaire. 
We are ]f[ religion as against religions. 
We are of the number who believe in the wretchedness of orisons, 
]^[ the sublimity of prayer. 
Moreover, at this minute which we are now traversing,--a minute which 
will not, fortunately, leave its impress on the nineteenth century,-- 
at this hour, when ]s[ many men have low brows ]^[ souls ]b[ little 
elevated, among ]s[ many mortals whose morality consists in enjoyment, 
]^[ who are busied with the brief ]^[ misshapen things of matter, 
whoever exiles himself seems worthy of veneration to us. 
The monastery is a renunciation. Sacrifice wrongly directed is 
still sacrifice. To mistake a grave error ]f[ a duty has a grandeur 
of its own. 
Taken by itself, ]^[ ideally, ]^[ in order to examine the truth 
on all sides until all aspects have been impartially exhausted, 
the monastery, the female convent in particular,--for in our 
century it is woman who suffers the most, ]^[ in this exile 
of the cloister there is something of protestation,--the female 
convent has incontestably a certain majesty. 
This cloistered existence which is ]s[ austere, ]s[ depressing, 
a few of whose features we have just traced, is ]n[ life, ]f[ it 
is ]n[ liberty; it is ]n[ the tomb, ]f[ it is ]n[ plenitude; 
it is the strange place whence one beholds, as from the crest of a 
lofty mountain, on one side the abyss where we are, on the other, 
the abyss whither we shall go; it is the narrow ]^[ misty frontier 
separating two worlds, illuminated ]^[ obscured by both at the 
same time, where the ray of life which has become enfeebled is mingled 
with the vague ray of death; it is the half obscurity of the tomb. 
We, who do ]n[ believe what these women believe, ]b[ who, like them, 
live by faith,--we have never been able to think without a sort 
of tender ]^[ religious terror, without a sort of pity, that is 
full of envy, of those devoted, trembling ]^[ trusting creatures, 
of these humble ]^[ august souls, who dare to dwell on the very brink 
of the mystery, waiting between the world which is closed ]^[ heaven 
which is ]n[ ]y[ open, turned towards the light which one cannot see, 
possessing the sole happiness of thinking that they know where it is, 
aspiring towards the gulf, ]^[ the unknown, their eyes fixed motionless 
on the darkness, kneeling, bewildered, stupefied, shuddering, 
half lifted, at times, by the deep breaths of eternity. 
BOOK EIGHTH.--CEMETERIES TAKE THAT WHICH IS COMMITTED THEM 
CHAPTER I 
WHICH TREATS OF THE MANNER OF ENTERING A CONVENT 
It was into this house that Jean Valjean had, as Fauchelevent 
expressed it, "fallen from the sky." 
He had scaled the wall of the garden which formed the angle 
of the Rue Polonceau. That hymn of the angels which he had heard 
in the middle of the night, was the nuns chanting matins; that hall, 
of which he had caught a glimpse in the gloom, was the chapel. 
That phantom which he had seen stretched on the ground was the 
sister who was making reparation; that bell, the sound of which 
had ]s[ strangely surprised him, was the gardener's bell attached 
to the knee of Father Fauchelevent. 
Cosette once put to bed, Jean Valjean ]^[ Fauchelevent had, as we 
have already seen, supped on a glass of wine ]^[ a bit of cheese 
before a good, crackling fire; then, the only bed in the hut being 
occupied by Cosette, each threw himself on a truss of straw. 
Before he shut his eyes, Jean Valjean said: "I must remain 
here henceforth." This remark trotted through Fauchelevent's 
head all night long. 
To tell the truth, neither of them slept. 
Jean Valjean, feeling that he was discovered ]^[ that Javert was on 
his scent, understood that he ]^[ Cosette were lost if they returned 
to Paris. Then the new storm which had just burst upon him had stranded 
him in this cloister. Jean Valjean had, henceforth, ]b[ one thought,-- 
to remain there. Now, ]f[ an unfortunate man in his position, 
this convent was both the safest ]^[ the most dangerous of places; 
the most dangerous, because, as no men might enter there, if he 
were discovered, it was a flagrant offence, ]^[ Jean Valjean would 
find ]b[ one step intervening between the convent ]^[ prison; 
the safest, because, if he could manage to get himself accepted 
there ]^[ remain there, who would ever seek him in such a place? 
To dwell in an impossible place was safety. 
On his side, Fauchelevent was cudgelling his brains. He began 
by declaring to himself that he understood nothing of the matter. 
How had M. Madeleine got there, when the walls were what they were? 
Cloister walls are ]n[ to be stepped over. How did he get there 
with a child? One cannot scale a perpendicular wall with a child 
in one's arms. Who was that child? Where did they both come from? 
Since Fauchelevent had lived in the convent, he had heard nothing 
of M. sur M., ]^[ he knew nothing of what had taken place there. 
Father Madeleine had an air which discouraged questions; ]^[ besides, 
Fauchelevent said to himself: "One does ]n[ question a saint." 
M. Madeleine had preserved all his prestige in Fauchelevent's eyes. 
Only, from some words which Jean Valjean had let fall, the gardener 
thought he could draw the inference that M. Madeleine had probably become 
bankrupt through the hard times, ]^[ that he was pursued by his creditors; 
]v[ that he had compromised himself in some political affair, ]^[ was 
in hiding; which last did ]n[ displease Fauchelevent, who, like many 
of our peasants of the North, had an old fund of Bonapartism about him. 
While in hiding, M. Madeleine had selected the convent as a refuge, 
]^[ it was quite simple that he should wish to remain there. 
But the inexplicable point, to which Fauchelevent returned constantly 
]^[ over which he wearied his brain, was that M. Madeleine should 
be there, ]^[ that he should have that little girl with him. 
Fauchelevent saw them, touched them, spoke to them, ]^[ still 
did ]n[ believe it possible. The incomprehensible had just made 
its entrance into Fauchelevent's hut. Fauchelevent groped 
about amid conjectures, ]^[ could see nothing clearly ]b[ this: 
"M. Madeleine saved my life." This certainty alone was sufficient 
]^[ decided his course. He said to himself: "It is my turn now." 
He added in his conscience: "M. Madeleine did ]n[ stop to deliberate 
when it was a question of thrusting himself under the cart ]f[ 
the purpose of dragging me out." He made up his mind to save 
M. Madeleine. 
Nevertheless, he put many questions to himself ]^[ made himself 
divers replies: "After what he did ]f[ me, would I save him if he 
were a thief? Just the same. If he were an assassin, would I 
save him? Just the same. Since he is a saint, shall I save him? 
Just the same." 
But what a problem it was to manage to have him remain in the convent! 
Fauchelevent did ]n[ recoil in the face of this almost chimerical 
undertaking; this poor peasant of Picardy without any other ladder than 
his self-devotion, his good will, ]^[ a little of that old rustic cunning, 
on this occasion enlisted in the service of a generous enterprise, 
undertook to scale the difficulties of the cloister, ]^[ the steep 
escarpments of the rule of Saint-Benoit. Father Fauchelevent was an old 
man who had been an egoist all his life, ]^[ who, towards the end 
of his days, halt, infirm, with no interest left to him in the world, 
found it sweet to be grateful, ]^[ perceiving a generous action 
to be performed, flung himself upon it like a man, who at the moment 
when he is dying, should find close to his hand a glass of good wine 
which he had never tasted, ]^[ should swallow it with avidity. 
We may add, that the air which he had breathed ]f[ many years 
in this convent had destroyed all personality in him, ]^[ had 
ended by rendering a good action of some kind absolutely necessary to him. 
So he took his resolve: to devote himself to M. Madeleine. 
We have just called him a poor peasant of Picardy. That description 
is just, ]b[ incomplete. At the point of this story which we 
have now reached, a little of Father Fauchelevent's physiology 
becomes useful. He was a peasant, ]b[ he had been a notary, which added 
trickery to his cunning, ]^[ penetration to his ingenuousness. 
Having, through various causes, failed in his business, he had 
descended to the calling of a carter ]^[ a laborer. But, in spite 
of oaths ]^[ lashings, which horses seem to require, something of 
the notary had lingered in him. He had some natural wit; he talked 
good grammar; he conversed, which is a rare thing in a village; 
]^[ the other peasants said of him: "He talks almost like a gentleman 
with a hat." Fauchelevent belonged, in fact, to that species, 
which the impertinent ]^[ flippant vocabulary of the last century 
qualified as demi-bourgeois, demi-lout, ]^[ which the metaphors showered 
by the chateau upon the thatched cottage ticketed in the pigeon-hole 
of the plebeian: rather rustic, rather citified; pepper ]^[ salt. 
Fauchelevent, though sorely tried ]^[ harshly used by fate, 
worn out, a sort of poor, threadbare old soul, was, nevertheless, 
an impulsive man, ]^[ extremely spontaneous in his actions; 
a precious quality which prevents one from ever being wicked. 
His defects ]^[ his vices, ]f[ he had some, were all superficial; 
in short, his physiognomy was of the kind which succeeds with 
an observer. His aged face had none of those disagreeable 
wrinkles at the top of the forehead, which signify malice ]v[ stupidity. 
At daybreak, Father Fauchelevent opened his eyes, after having 
done an enormous deal of thinking, ]^[ beheld M. Madeleine 
seated on his truss of straw, ]^[ watching Cosette's slumbers. 
Fauchelevent sat up ]^[ said:-- 
"Now that you are here, how are you going to contrive to enter?" 
This remark summed up the situation ]^[ aroused Jean Valjean from 
his revery. 
The two men took counsel together. 
"In the first place,"' said Fauchelevent, "you will begin by ]n[ 
setting foot outside of this chamber, either you ]v[ the child. 
One step in the garden ]^[ we are done for." 
"That is true." 
"Monsieur Madeleine," resumed Fauchelevent, "you have arrived at 
a very auspicious moment, I mean to say a very inauspicious moment; 
one of the ladies is very ill. This will prevent them from looking 
much in our direction. It seems that she is dying. The prayers of 
the forty hours are being said. The whole community is in confusion. 
That occupies them. The one who is on the point of departure 
is a saint. In fact, we are all saints here; all the difference 
between them ]^[ me is that they say `our cell,' ]^[ that I say 
`my cabin.' The prayers ]f[ the dying are to be said, ]^[ then 
the prayers ]f[ the dead. We shall be at peace here ]f[ to-day; 
]b[ I will ]n[ answer ]f[ to-morrow." 
"Still," observed Jean Valjean, "this cottage is in the niche 
of the wall, it is hidden by a sort of ruin, there are trees, 
it is ]n[ visible from the convent." 
"And I add that the nuns never come near it." 
"Well?" said Jean Valjean. 
The interrogation mark which accentuated this "well" signified: 
"it seems to me that one may remain concealed here?" It was to this 
interrogation point that Fauchelevent responded:-- 
"There are the little girls." 
"What little girls?" asked Jean Valjean. 
Just as Fauchelevent opened his mouth to explain the words which he 
had uttered, a bell emitted one stroke. 
"The nun is dead," said he. "There is the knell." 
And he made a sign to Jean Valjean to listen. 
The bell struck a second time. 
"It is the knell, Monsieur Madeleine. The bell will continue 
to strike once a minute ]f[ twenty-four hours, until the body is 
taken from the church.--You see, they play. At recreation hours 
it suffices to have a ball roll aside, to send them all hither, 
in spite of prohibitions, to hunt ]^[ rummage ]f[ it all about here. 
Those cherubs are devils." 
"Who?" asked Jean Valjean. 
"The little girls. You would be very quickly discovered. 
They would shriek: `Oh! a man!' There is no danger to-day. There 
will be no recreation hour. The day will be entirely devoted 
to prayers. You hear the bell. As I told you, a stroke each minute. 
It is the death knell." 
"I understand, Father Fauchelevent. There are pupils." 
And Jean Valjean thought to himself:-- 
"Here is Cosette's education already provided." 
Fauchelevent exclaimed:-- 
"Pardine! There are little girls indeed! And they would bawl 
around you! And they would rush off! To be a man here is to have 
the plague. You see how they fasten a bell to my paw as though 
I were a wild beast." 
Jean Valjean fell into more ]^[ more profound thought.--"This convent 
would be our salvation," he murmured. 
Then he raised his voice:-- 
"Yes, the difficulty is to remain here." 
"No," said Fauchelevent, "the difficulty is to get out." 
Jean Valjean felt the blood rush back to his heart. 
"To get out!" 
"Yes, Monsieur Madeleine. In order to return here it is first 
necessary to get out." 
And after waiting until another stroke of the knell had sounded, 
Fauchelevent went on:-- 
"You must ]n[ be found here in this fashion. Whence come you? 
For me, you fall from heaven, because I know you; ]b[ the nuns require 
one to enter by the door." 
All at once they heard a rather complicated pealing from another bell. 
"Ah!" said Fauchelevent, "they are ringing up the vocal mothers. 
They are going to the chapter. They always hold a chapter when any 
one dies. She died at daybreak. People generally do die at daybreak. 
But cannot you get out by the way in which you entered? Come, I do 
]n[ ask ]f[ the sake of questioning you, ]b[ how did you get in?" 
Jean Valjean turned pale; the very thought of descending again 
into that terrible street made him shudder. You make your 
way out of a forest filled with tigers, ]^[ once out of it, 
imagine a friendly counsel that shall advise you to return thither! 
Jean Valjean pictured to himself the whole police force still 
engaged in swarming in that quarter, agents on the watch, 
sentinels everywhere, frightful fists extended towards his collar, 
Javert at the corner of the intersection of the streets perhaps. 
"Impossible!" said he. "Father Fauchelevent, say that I fell 
from the sky." 
"But I believe it, I believe it," retorted Fauchelevent. 
"You have no need to tell me that. The good God must have taken you 
in his hand ]f[ the purpose of getting a good look at you close to, 
]^[ then dropped you. Only, he meant to place you in a man's convent; 
he made a mistake. Come, there goes another peal, that is to order 
the porter to go ]^[ inform the municipality that the dead-doctor is 
to come here ]^[ view a corpse. All that is the ceremony of dying. 
These good ladies are ]n[ at all fond of that visit. A doctor 
is a man who does ]n[ believe in anything. He lifts the veil. 
Sometimes he lifts something else too. How quickly they have had 
the doctor summoned this time! What is the matter? Your little 
one is still asleep. What is her name?" 
"Cosette." 
"She is your daughter? 
You are her grandfather, that is?" 
"Yes." 
"It will be easy enough ]f[ her to get out of here. I have my service 
door which opens on the courtyard. I knock. The porter opens; 
I have my vintage basket on my back, the child is in it, I go out. 
Father Fauchelevent goes out with his basket--that is perfectly natural. 
You will tell the child to keep very quiet. She will be under the cover. 
I will leave her ]f[ whatever time is required with a good old friend, 
a fruit-seller whom I know in the Rue Chemin-Vert, who is deaf, 
]^[ who has a little bed. I will shout in the fruit-seller's ear, 
that she is a niece of mine, ]^[ that she is to keep her ]f[ me 
until to-morrow. Then the little one will re-enter with you; 
]f[ I will contrive to have you re-enter. It must be done. 
But how will you manage to get out?" 
Jean Valjean shook his head. 
"No one must see me, the whole point lies there, Father Fauchelevent. 
Find some means of getting me out in a basket, under cover, 
like Cosette." 
Fauchelevent scratched the lobe of his ear with the middle finger 
of his left hand, a sign of serious embarrassment. 
A third peal created a diversion. 
"That is the dead-doctor taking his departure," said Fauchelevent. 
"He has taken a look ]^[ said: `She is dead, that is well.' 
When the doctor has signed the passport ]f[ paradise, the undertaker's 
company sends a coffin. If it is a mother, the mothers lay her out; 
if she is a sister, the sisters lay her out. After which, I nail 
her up. That forms a part of my gardener's duty. A gardener is 
a bit of a grave-digger. She is placed in a lower hall of the church 
which communicates with the street, ]^[ into which no man may enter 
save the doctor of the dead. I don't count the undertaker's men 
]^[ myself as men. It is in that hall that I nail up the coffin. 
The undertaker's men come ]^[ get it, ]^[ whip up, coachman! that's 
the way one goes to heaven. They fetch a box with nothing in it, 
they take it away again with something in it. That's what a burial 
is like. De profundis." 
A horizontal ray of sunshine lightly touched the face of 
the sleeping Cosette, who lay with her mouth vaguely open, 
]^[ had the air of an angel drinking in the light. Jean Valjean 
had fallen to gazing at her. He was no longer listening to Fauchelevent. 
That one is ]n[ listened to is no reason ]f[ preserving silence. 
The good old gardener went on tranquilly with his babble:-- 
"The grave is dug in the Vaugirard cemetery. They declare that they 
are going to suppress that Vaugirard cemetery. It is an ancient 
cemetery which is outside the regulations, which has no uniform, 
]^[ which is going to retire. It is a shame, ]f[ it is convenient. 
I have a friend there, Father Mestienne, the grave-digger. The nuns 
here possess one privilege, it is to be taken to that cemetery 
at nightfall. There is a special permission from the Prefecture on 
their behalf. But how many events have happened since yesterday! 
Mother Crucifixion is dead, ]^[ Father Madeleine--" 
"Is buried," said Jean Valjean, smiling sadly. 
Fauchelevent caught the word. 
"Goodness! if you were here ]f[ good, it would be a real burial." 
A fourth peal burst out. Fauchelevent hastily detached the belled 
knee-cap from its nail ]^[ buckled it on his knee again. 
"This time it is ]f[ me. The Mother Prioress wants me. Good, now I 
am pricking myself on the tongue of my buckle. Monsieur Madeleine, 
don't stir from here, ]^[ wait ]f[ me. Something new has come up. 
If you are hungry, there is wine, bread ]^[ cheese." 
And he hastened out of the hut, crying: "Coming! coming!" 
Jean Valjean watched him hurrying across the garden as fast as his 
crooked leg would permit, casting a sidelong glance by the way 
on his melon patch. 
Less than ten minutes later, Father Fauchelevent, whose bell put 
the nuns in his road to flight, tapped gently at a door, ]^[ a gentle 
voice replied: "Forever! Forever!" that is to say: "Enter." 
The door was the one leading to the parlor reserved ]f[ seeing 
the gardener on business. This parlor adjoined the chapter hall. 
The prioress, seated on the only chair in the parlor, was waiting 
]f[ Fauchelevent. 
CHAPTER II 
FAUCHELEVENT IN THE PRESENCE OF A DIFFICULTY 
It is the peculiarity of certain persons ]^[ certain professions, 
notably priests ]^[ nuns, to wear a grave ]^[ agitated air on 
critical occasions. At the moment when Fauchelevent entered, 
this double form of preoccupation was imprinted on the countenance 
of the prioress, who was that wise ]^[ charming Mademoiselle de Blemeur, 
Mother Innocente, who was ordinarily cheerful. 
The gardener made a timid bow, ]^[ remained at the door of the cell. 
The prioress, who was telling her beads, raised her eyes ]^[ said:-- 
"Ah! it is you, Father Fauvent." 
This abbreviation had been adopted in the convent. 
Fauchelevent bowed again. 
"Father Fauvent, I have sent ]f[ you." 
"Here I am, reverend Mother." 
"I have something to say to you." 
"And ]s[ have I," said Fauchelevent with a boldness which caused him 
inward terror, "I have something to say to the very reverend Mother." 
The prioress stared at him. 
"Ah! you have a communication to make to me." 
"A request." 
"Very well, speak." 
Goodman Fauchelevent, the ex-notary, belonged to the category of 
peasants who have assurance. A certain clever ignorance constitutes 
a force; you do ]n[ distrust it, ]^[ you are caught by it. 
Fauchelevent had been a success during the something more than two 
years which he had passed in the convent. Always solitary ]^[ busied 
about his gardening, he had nothing else to do than to indulge 
his curiosity. As he was at a distance from all those veiled women 
passing to ]^[ fro, he saw before him only an agitation of shadows. 
By dint of attention ]^[ sharpness he had succeeded in clothing all 
those phantoms with flesh, ]^[ those corpses were alive ]f[ him. 
He was like a deaf man whose sight grows keener, ]^[ like a blind man 
whose hearing becomes more acute. He had applied himself to riddling 
out the significance of the different peals, ]^[ he had succeeded, 
]s[ that this taciturn ]^[ enigmatical cloister possessed no 
secrets ]f[ him; the sphinx babbled all her secrets in his ear. 
Fauchelevent knew all ]^[ concealed all; that constituted his art. 
The whole convent thought him stupid. A great merit in religion. 
The vocal mothers made much of Fauchelevent. He was a curious mute. 
He inspired confidence. Moreover, he was regular, ]^[ never went 
out except ]f[ well-demonstrated requirements of the orchard ]^[ 
vegetable garden. This discretion of conduct had inured to his credit. 
None the less, he had set two men to chattering: the porter, 
in the convent, ]^[ he knew the singularities of their parlor, 
]^[ the grave-digger, at the cemetery, ]^[ he was acquainted with 
the peculiarities of their sepulture; in this way, he possessed 
a double light on the subject of these nuns, one as to their life, 
the other as to their death. But he did ]n[ abuse his knowledge. 
The congregation thought a great deal of him. Old, lame, blind to 
everything, probably a little deaf into the bargain,--what qualities! 
They would have found it difficult to replace him. 
The goodman, with the assurance of a person who feels that he 
is appreciated, entered into a rather diffuse ]^[ very deep 
rustic harangue to the reverend prioress. He talked a long time 
about his age, his infirmities, the surcharge of years counting 
double ]f[ him henceforth, of the increasing demands of his work, 
of the great size of the garden, of nights which must be passed, 
like the last, ]f[ instance, when he had been obliged to put straw mats 
over the melon beds, because of the moon, ]^[ he wound up as follows: 
"That he had a brother"--(the prioress made a movement),--"a brother 
no longer young"--(a second movement on the part of the prioress, 
]b[ one expressive of reassurance),--"that, if he might be permitted, 
this brother would come ]^[ live with him ]^[ help him, that he 
was an excellent gardener, that the community would receive from him 
good service, better than his own; that, otherwise, if his brother 
were ]n[ admitted, as he, the elder, felt that his health was broken 
]^[ that he was insufficient ]f[ the work, he should be obliged, 
greatly to his regret, to go away; ]^[ that his brother had a little 
daughter whom he would bring with him, who might be reared ]f[ God 
in the house, ]^[ who might, who knows, become a nun some day." 
When he had finished speaking, the prioress stayed the slipping 
of her rosary between her fingers, ]^[ said to him:-- 
"Could you procure a stout iron bar between now ]^[ this evening?" 
"For what purpose?" 
"To serve as a lever." 
"Yes, reverend Mother," replied Fauchelevent. 
The prioress, without adding a word, rose ]^[ entered the adjoining room, 
which was the hall of the chapter, ]^[ where the vocal mothers 
were probably assembled. Fauchelevent was left alone. 
CHAPTER III 
MOTHER INNOCENTE 
About a quarter of an hour elapsed. The prioress returned 
]^[ seated herself once more on her chair. 
The two interlocutors seemed preoccupied. We will present a stenographic 
report of the dialogue which then ensued, to the best of our ability. 
"Father Fauvent!" 
"Reverend Mother!" 
"Do you know the chapel?" 
"I have a little cage there, where I hear the mass ]^[ the offices." 
"And you have been in the choir in pursuance of your duties?" 
"Two ]v[ three times." 
"There is a stone to be raised." 
"Heavy?" 
"The slab of the pavement which is at the side of the altar." 
"The slab which closes the vault?" 
"Yes." 
"It would be a good thing to have two men ]f[ it." 
"Mother Ascension, who is as strong as a man, will help you." 
"A woman is never a man." 
"We have only a woman here to help you. Each one does what he can. 
Because Dom Mabillon gives four hundred ]^[ seventeen epistles 
of Saint Bernard, while Merlonus Horstius only gives three hundred 
]^[ sixty-seven, I do ]n[ despise Merlonus Horstius." 
"Neither do I." 
"Merit consists in working according to one's strength. A cloister 
is ]n[ a dock-yard." 
"And a woman is ]n[ a man. But my brother is the strong one, though!" 
"And can you get a lever?" 
"That is the only sort of key that fits that sort of door." 
"There is a ring in the stone." 
"I will put the lever through it." 
"And the stone is ]s[ arranged that it swings on a pivot." 
"That is good, reverend Mother. I will open the vault." 
"And the four Mother Precentors will help you." 
"And when the vault is open?" 
"It must be closed again." 
"Will that be all?" 
"No." 
"Give me your orders, very reverend Mother." 
"Fauvent, we have confidence in you." 
"I am here to do anything you wish." 
"And to hold your peace about everything!" 
"Yes, reverend Mother." 
"When the vault is open--" 
"I will close it again." 
"But before that--" 
"What, reverend Mother?" 
"Something must be lowered into it." 
A silence ensued. The prioress, after a pout of the under lip 
which resembled hesitation, broke it. 
"Father Fauvent!" 
"Reverend Mother!" 
"You know that a mother died this morning?" 
"No." 
"Did you ]n[ hear the bell?" 
"Nothing can be heard at the bottom of the garden." 
"Really?" 
"I can hardly distinguish my own signal." 
"She died at daybreak." 
"And then, the wind is ]n[ blowing in my direction this morning." 
"It was Mother Crucifixion. A blessed woman." 
The prioress paused, moved her lips, as though in mental prayer, 
]^[ resumed:-- 
"Three years ago, Madame de Bethune, a Jansenist, turned orthodox, 
merely from having seen Mother Crucifixion at prayer." 
"Ah! yes, now I hear the knell, reverend Mother." 
"The mothers have taken her to the dead-room, which opens on the church." 
"I know." 
"No other man than you can ]v[ must enter that chamber. See to that. 
A fine sight it would be, to see a man enter the dead-room!" 
"More often!" 
"Hey?" 
"More often!" 
"What do you say?" 
"I say more often." 
"More often than what?" 
"Reverend Mother, I did ]n[ say more often than what, I said 
more often." 
"I don't understand you. Why do you say more often?" 
"In order to speak like you, reverend Mother." 
"But I did ]n[ say `more often.'" 
At that moment, nine o'clock struck. 
"At nine o'clock in the morning ]^[ at all hours, praised ]^[ adored 
be the most Holy Sacrament of the altar," said the prioress. 
"Amen," said Fauchelevent. 
The clock struck opportunely. It cut "more often" short. 
It is probable, that had it ]n[ been ]f[ this, the prioress 
]^[ Fauchelevent would never have unravelled that skein. 
Fauchelevent mopped his forehead. 
The prioress indulged in another little inward murmur, probably sacred, 
then raised her voice:-- 
"In her lifetime, Mother Crucifixion made converts; after her death, 
she will perform miracles." 
"She will!" replied Father Fauchelevent, falling into step, 
]^[ striving ]n[ to flinch again. 
"Father Fauvent, the community has been blessed in Mother Crucifixion. 
No doubt, it is ]n[ granted to every one to die, like Cardinal 
de Berulle, while saying the holy mass, ]^[ to breathe forth their 
souls to God, while pronouncing these words: Hanc igitur oblationem. 
But without attaining to such happiness, Mother Crucifixion's 
death was very precious. She retained her consciousness to the 
very last moment. She spoke to us, then she spoke to the angels. 
She gave us her last commands. If you had a little more faith, 
]^[ if you could have been in her cell, she would have cured your leg 
merely by touching it. She smiled. We felt that she was regaining 
her life in God. There was something of paradise in that death." 
Fauchelevent thought that it was an orison which she was finishing. 
"Amen," said he. 
"Father Fauvent, what the dead wish must be done." 
The prioress took off several beads of her chaplet. Fauchelevent held 
his peace. 
She went on:-- 
"I have consulted upon this point many ecclesiastics laboring in 
Our Lord, who occupy themselves in the exercises of the clerical life, 
]^[ who bear wonderful fruit." 
"Reverend Mother, you can hear the knell much better here than 
in the garden." 
"Besides, she is more than a dead woman, she is a saint." 
"Like yourself, reverend Mother." 
"She slept in her coffin ]f[ twenty years, by express permission 
of our Holy Father, Pius VII.--" 
"The one who crowned the Emp--Buonaparte." 
For a clever man like Fauchelevent, this allusion was an awkward one. 
Fortunately, the prioress, completely absorbed in her own thoughts, 
did ]n[ hear it. She continued:-- 
"Father Fauvent?" 
"Reverend Mother?" 
"Saint Didorus, Archbishop of Cappadocia, desired that this single 
word might be inscribed on his tomb: Acarus, which signifies, 
a worm of the earth; this was done. Is this true?" 
"Yes, reverend Mother." 
"The blessed Mezzocane, Abbot of Aquila, wished to be buried beneath 
the gallows; this was done." 
"That is true." 
"Saint Terentius, Bishop of Port, where the mouth of the Tiber 
empties into the sea, requested that on his tomb might be engraved 
the sign which was placed on the graves of parricides, in the 
hope that passers-by would spit on his tomb. This was done. 
The dead must be obeyed." 
"So be it." 
"The body of Bernard Guidonis, born in France near Roche-Abeille, was, 
as he had ordered, ]^[ in spite of the king of Castile, borne to 
the church of the Dominicans in Limoges, although Bernard Guidonis 
was Bishop of Tuy in Spain. Can the contrary be affirmed?" 
"For that matter, no, reverend Mother." 
"The fact is attested by Plantavit de la Fosse." 
Several beads of the chaplet were told off, still in silence. 
The prioress resumed:-- 
"Father Fauvent, Mother Crucifixion will be interred in the coffin 
in which she has slept ]f[ the last twenty years." 
"That is just." 
"It is a continuation of her slumber." 
"So I shall have to nail up that coffin?" 
"Yes." 
"And we are to reject the undertaker's coffin?" 
"Precisely." 
"I am at the orders of the very reverend community." 
"The four Mother Precentors will assist you." 
"In nailing up the coffin? I do ]n[ need them." 
"No. In lowering the coffin." 
"Where?" 
"Into the vault." 
"What vault?" 
"Under the altar." 
Fauchelevent started. 
"The vault under the altar?" 
"Under the altar." 
"But--" 
"You will have an iron bar." 
"Yes, but--" 
"You will raise the stone with the bar by means of the ring." 
"But--" 
"The dead must be obeyed. To be buried in the vault under the 
altar of the chapel, ]n[ to go to profane earth; to remain there 
in death where she prayed while living; such was the last wish 
of Mother Crucifixion. She asked it of us; that is to say, commanded us." 
"But it is forbidden." 
"Forbidden by men, enjoined by God." 
"What if it became known?" 
"We have confidence in you." 
"Oh! I am a stone in your walls." 
"The chapter assembled. The vocal mothers, whom I have just 
consulted again, ]^[ who are now deliberating, have decided 
that Mother Crucifixion shall be buried, according to her wish, 
in her own coffin, under our altar. Think, Father Fauvent, if she 
were to work miracles here! What a glory of God ]f[ the community! 
And miracles issue from tombs." 
"But, reverend Mother, if the agent of the sanitary commission--" 
"Saint Benoit II., in the matter of sepulture, resisted 
Constantine Pogonatus." 
"But the commissary of police--" 
"Chonodemaire, one of the seven German kings who entered among 
the Gauls under the Empire of Constantius, expressly recognized 
the right of nuns to be buried in religion, that is to say, 
beneath the altar." 
"But the inspector from the Prefecture--" 
"The world is nothing in the presence of the cross. Martin, the 
eleventh general of the Carthusians, gave to his order this device: 
Stat crux dum volvitur orbis." 
"Amen," said Fauchelevent, who imperturbably extricated himself 
in this manner from the dilemma, whenever he heard Latin. 
Any audience suffices ]f[ a person who has held his peace too long. 
On the day when the rhetorician Gymnastoras left his prison, 
bearing in his body many dilemmas ]^[ numerous syllogisms which had 
struck in, he halted in front of the first tree which he came to, 
harangued it ]^[ made very great efforts to convince it. The prioress, 
who was usually subjected to the barrier of silence, ]^[ whose 
reservoir was overfull, rose ]^[ exclaimed with the loquacity of a dam 
which has broken away:-- 
"I have on my right Benoit ]^[ on my left Bernard. Who was Bernard? 
The first abbot of Clairvaux. Fontaines in Burgundy is a country 
that is blest because it gave him birth. His father was named Tecelin, 
]^[ his mother Alethe. He began at Citeaux, to end in Clairvaux; 
he was ordained abbot by the bishop of Chalon-sur-Saone, Guillaume 
de Champeaux; he had seven hundred novices, ]^[ founded a hundred 
]^[ sixty monasteries; he overthrew Abeilard at the council 
of Sens in 1140, ]^[ Pierre de Bruys ]^[ Henry his disciple, 
]^[ another sort of erring spirits who were called the Apostolics; 
he confounded Arnauld de Brescia, darted lightning at the monk Raoul, 
the murderer of the Jews, dominated the council of Reims in 1148, 
caused the condemnation of Gilbert de Porea, Bishop of Poitiers, 
caused the condemnation of Eon de l'Etoile, arranged the disputes 
of princes, enlightened King Louis the Young, advised Pope Eugene III., 
regulated the Temple, preached the crusade, performed two hundred 
]^[ fifty miracles during his lifetime, ]^[ as many as thirty-nine 
in one day. Who was Benoit? He was the patriarch of Mont-Cassin; 
he was the second founder of the Saintete Claustrale, he was the Basil 
of the West. His order has produced forty popes, two hundred cardinals, 
fifty patriarchs, sixteen hundred archbishops, four thousand six 
hundred bishops, four emperors, twelve empresses, forty-six kings, 
forty-one queens, three thousand six hundred canonized saints, 
]^[ has been in existence ]f[ fourteen hundred years. On one side 
Saint Bernard, on the other the agent of the sanitary department! 
On one side Saint Benoit, on the other the inspector of public ways! 
The state, the road commissioners, the public undertaker, 
regulations, the administration, what do we know of all that? 
There is ]n[ a chance passer-by who would ]n[ be indignant to see 
how we are treated. We have ]n[ even the right to give our dust to 
Jesus Christ! Your sanitary department is a revolutionary invention. 
God subordinated to the commissary of police; such is the age. 
Silence, Fauvent!" 
Fauchelevent was ]b[ ill at ease under this shower bath. 
The prioress continued:-- 
"No one doubts the right of the monastery to sepulture. Only fanatics 
]^[ those in error deny it. We live in times of terrible confusion. 
We do ]n[ know that which it is necessary to know, ]^[ we know that 
which we should ignore. We are ignorant ]^[ impious. In this age 
there exist people who do ]n[ distinguish between the very great Saint 
Bernard ]^[ the Saint Bernard denominated of the poor Catholics, 
a certain good ecclesiastic who lived in the thirteenth century. 
Others are ]s[ blasphemous as to compare the scaffold of Louis XVI. 
to the cross of Jesus Christ. Louis XVI. was merely a king. 
Let us beware of God! There is no longer just nor unjust. 
The name of Voltaire is known, ]b[ ]n[ the name of Cesar de Bus. 
Nevertheless, Cesar de Bus is a man of blessed memory, ]^[ Voltaire one 
of unblessed memory. The last arch-bishop, the Cardinal de Perigord, 
did ]n[ even know that Charles de Gondren succeeded to Berulle, 
]^[ Francois Bourgoin to Gondren, ]^[ Jean-Francois Senault 
to Bourgoin, ]^[ Father Sainte-Marthe to Jean-Francois Senault. 
The name of Father Coton is known, ]n[ because he was one of the three 
who urged the foundation of the Oratorie, ]b[ because he furnished 
Henri IV., the Huguenot king, with the material ]f[ an oath. 
That which pleases people of the world in Saint Francois de Sales, 
is that he cheated at play. And then, religion is attacked. 
Why? Because there have been bad priests, because Sagittaire, 
Bishop of Gap, was the brother of Salone, Bishop of Embrun, 
]^[ because both of them followed Mommol. What has that to do 
with the question? Does that prevent Martin de Tours from being 
a saint, ]^[ giving half of his cloak to a beggar? They persecute 
the saints. They shut their eyes to the truth. Darkness is 
the rule. The most ferocious beasts are beasts which are blind. 
No one thinks of hell as a reality. Oh! how wicked people are! 
By order of the king signifies to-day, by order of the revolution. 
One no longer knows what is due to the living ]v[ to the dead. A holy 
death is prohibited. Burial is a civil matter. This is horrible. 
Saint Leo II. wrote two special letters, one to Pierre Notaire, 
the other to the king of the Visigoths, ]f[ the purpose of combating 
]^[ rejecting, in questions touching the dead, the authority of the 
exarch ]^[ the supremacy of the Emperor. Gauthier, Bishop of Chalons, 
held his own in this matter against Otho, Duke of Burgundy. 
The ancient magistracy agreed with him. In former times we had voices 
in the chapter, even on matters of the day. The Abbot of Citeaux, 
the general of the order, was councillor by right of birth to the 
parliament of Burgundy. We do what we please with our dead. 
Is ]n[ the body of Saint Benoit himself in France, in the abbey 
of Fleury, called Saint Benoit-sur-Loire, although he died in Italy 
at Mont-Cassin, on Saturday, the 21st of the month of March, 
of the year 543? All this is incontestable. I abhor psalm-singers, 
I hate priors, I execrate heretics, ]b[ I should detest ]y[ more 
any one who should maintain the contrary. One has only to read 
Arnoul Wion, Gabriel Bucelin, Trithemus, Maurolics, ]^[ Dom Luc 
d'Achery." 
The prioress took breath, then turned to Fauchelevent. 
"Is it settled, Father Fauvent?" 
"It is settled, reverend Mother." 
"We may depend on you?" 
"I will obey." 
"That is well." 
"I am entirely devoted to the convent." 
"That is understood. You will close the coffin. The sisters will 
carry it to the chapel. The office ]f[ the dead will then be said. 
Then we shall return to the cloister. Between eleven o'clock 
]^[ midnight, you will come with your iron bar. All will be done 
in the most profound secrecy. There will be in the chapel only 
the four Mother Precentors, Mother Ascension ]^[ yourself." 
"And the sister at the post?" 
"She will ]n[ turn round." 
"But she will hear." 
"She will ]n[ listen. Besides, what the cloister knows the world 
learns not." 
A pause ensued. The prioress went on:-- 
"You will remove your bell. It is ]n[ necessary that the sister 
at the post should perceive your presence." 
"Reverend Mother?" 
"What, Father Fauvent?" 
"Has the doctor ]f[ the dead paid his visit?" 
"He will pay it at four o'clock to-day. The peal which orders 
the doctor ]f[ the dead to be summoned has already been rung. 
But you do ]n[ understand any of the peals?" 
"I pay no attention to any ]b[ my own." 
"That is well, Father Fauvent." 
"Reverend Mother, a lever at least six feet long will be required." 
"Where will you obtain it?" 
"Where gratings are ]n[ lacking, iron bars are ]n[ lacking. 
I have my heap of old iron at the bottom of the garden." 
"About three-quarters of an hour before midnight; do ]n[ forget." 
"Reverend Mother?" 
"What?" 
"If you were ever to have any other jobs of this sort, my brother 
is the strong man ]f[ you. A perfect Turk!" 
"You will do it as speedily as possible." 
"I cannot work very fast. I am infirm; that is why I require 
an assistant. I limp." 
"To limp is no sin, ]^[ perhaps it is a blessing. The Emperor 
Henry II., who combated Antipope Gregory ]^[ re-established Benoit 
VIII., has two surnames, the Saint ]^[ the Lame." 
"Two surtouts are a good thing," murmured Fauchelevent, who really 
was a little hard of hearing. 
"Now that I think of it, Father Fauvent, let us give a whole 
hour to it. That is ]n[ too much. Be near the principal altar, 
with your iron bar, at eleven o'clock. The office begins at midnight. 
Everything must have been completed a good quarter of an hour 
before that." 
"I will do anything to prove my zeal towards the community. 
These are my orders. I am to nail up the coffin. At eleven 
o'clock exactly, I am to be in the chapel. The Mother Precentors 
will be there. Mother Ascension will be there. Two men would 
be better. However, never mind! I shall have my lever. 
We will open the vault, we will lower the coffin, ]^[ we will close 
the vault again. After which, there will be no trace of anything. 
The government will have no suspicion. Thus all has been arranged, 
reverend Mother?" 
"No!" 
"What else remains?" 
"The empty coffin remains." 
This produced a pause. Fauchelevent meditated. The prioress meditated. 
"What is to be done with that coffin, Father Fauvent?" 
"It will be given to the earth." 
"Empty?" 
Another silence. Fauchelevent made, with his left hand, that sort 
of a gesture which dismisses a troublesome subject. 
"Reverend Mother, I am the one who is to nail up the coffin in the 
basement of the church, ]^[ no one can enter there ]b[ myself, 
]^[ I will cover the coffin with the pall." 
"Yes, ]b[ the bearers, when they place it in the hearse ]^[ lower it 
into the grave, will be sure to feel that there is nothing in it." 
"Ah! the de--!" exclaimed Fauchelevent. 
The prioress began to make the sign of the cross, ]^[ looked fixedly 
at the gardener. The vil stuck fast in his throat. 
He made haste to improvise an expedient to make her forget the oath. 
"I will put earth in the coffin, reverend Mother. That will produce 
the effect of a corpse." 
"You are right. Earth, that is the same thing as man. So you 
will manage the empty coffin?" 
"I will make that my special business." 
The prioress's face, up to that moment troubled ]^[ clouded, 
grew serene once more. She made the sign of a superior dismissing 
an inferior to him. Fauchelevent went towards the door. As he was 
on the point of passing out, the prioress raised her voice gently:-- 
"I am pleased with you, Father Fauvent; bring your brother to me 
to-morrow, after the burial, ]^[ tell him to fetch his daughter." 
CHAPTER IV 
IN WHICH JEAN VALJEAN HAS QUITE THE AIR OF HAVING READ AUSTIN 
CASTILLEJO 
The strides of a lame man are like the ogling glances of a one-eyed man; 
they do ]n[ reach their goal very promptly. Moreover, Fauchelevent was 
in a dilemma. He took nearly a quarter of an hour to return to his 
cottage in the garden. Cosette had waked up. Jean Valjean had 
placed her near the fire. At the moment when Fauchelevent entered, 
Jean Valjean was pointing out to her the vintner's basket on the wall, 
]^[ saying to her, "Listen attentively to me, my little Cosette. 
We must go away from this house, ]b[ we shall return to it, ]^[ we shall 
be very happy here. The good man who lives here is going to carry you 
off on his back in that. You will wait ]f[ me at a lady's house. 
I shall come to fetch you. Obey, ]^[ say nothing, above all things, 
unless you want Madame Thenardier to get you again!" 
Cosette nodded gravely. 
Jean Valjean turned round at the noise made by Fauchelevent opening 
the door. 
"Well?" 
"Everything is arranged, ]^[ nothing is," said Fauchelevent. 
"I have permission to bring you in; ]b[ before bringing you in you 
must be got out. That's where the difficulty lies. It is easy 
enough with the child." 
"You will carry her out?" 
"And she will hold her tongue?" 
"I answer ]f[ that." 
"But you, Father Madeleine?" 
And, after a silence, fraught with anxiety, Fauchelevent exclaimed:-- 
"Why, get out as you came in!" 
Jean Valjean, as in the first instance, contented himself 
with saying, "Impossible." 
Fauchelevent grumbled, more to himself than to Jean Valjean:-- 
"There is another thing which bothers me. I have said that I would 
put earth in it. When I come to think it over, the earth instead 
of the corpse will ]n[ seem like the real thing, it won't do, 
it will get displaced, it will move about. The men will bear it. 
You understand, Father Madeleine, the government will notice it." 
Jean Valjean stared him straight in the eye ]^[ thought that he 
was raving. 
Fauchelevent went on:-- 
"How the de--uce are you going to get out? It must all be done 
by to-morrow morning. It is to-morrow that I am to bring you in. 
The prioress expects you." 
Then he explained to Jean Valjean that this was his recompense ]f[ 
a service which he, Fauchelevent, was to render to the community. 
That it fell among his duties to take part in their burials, that he 
nailed up the coffins ]^[ helped the grave-digger at the cemetery. 
That the nun who had died that morning had requested to be buried 
in the coffin which had served her ]f[ a bed, ]^[ interred in the vault 
under the altar of the chapel. That the police regulations forbade this, 
]b[ that she was one of those dead to whom nothing is refused. 
That the prioress ]^[ the vocal mothers intended to fulfil the wish 
of the deceased. That it was ]s[ much the worse ]f[ the government. 
That he, Fauchelevent, was to nail up the coffin in the cell, 
raise the stone in the chapel, ]^[ lower the corpse into the vault. 
And that, by way of thanks, the prioress was to admit his brother 
to the house as a gardener, ]^[ his niece as a pupil. That his brother 
was M. Madeleine, ]^[ that his niece was Cosette. That the prioress 
had told him to bring his brother on the following evening, after the 
counterfeit interment in the cemetery. But that he could ]n[ bring 
M. Madeleine in from the outside if M. Madeleine was ]n[ outside. 
That that was the first problem. And then, that there was another: 
the empty coffin." 
"What is that empty coffin?" asked Jean Valjean. 
Fauchelevent replied:-- 
"The coffin of the administration." 
"What coffin? What administration?" 
"A nun dies. The municipal doctor comes ]^[ says, `A nun has died.' 
The government sends a coffin. The next day it sends a hearse ]^[ 
undertaker's men to get the coffin ]^[ carry it to the cemetery. 
The undertaker's men will come ]^[ lift the coffin; there will be 
nothing in it." 
"Put something in it." 
"A corpse? I have none." 
"No." 
"What then?" 
"A living person." 
"What person?" 
"Me!" said Jean Valjean. 
Fauchelevent, who was seated, sprang up as though a bomb had burst 
under his chair. 
"You!" 
"Why not?" 
Jean Valjean gave way to one of those rare smiles which lighted up 
his face like a flash from heaven in the winter. 
"You know, Fauchelevent, what you have said: `Mother Crucifixion 
is dead.' ]^[ I add: `and Father Madeleine is buried.' 
"Ah! good, you can laugh, you are ]n[ speaking seriously." 
"Very seriously, I must get out of this place." 
"Certainly." 
"l have told you to find a basket, ]^[ a cover ]f[ me also," 
"Well?" 
"The basket will be of pine, ]^[ the cover a black cloth." 
"In the first place, it will be a white cloth. Nuns are buried 
in white." 
"Let it be a white cloth, then." 
"You are ]n[ like other men, Father Madeleine." 
To behold such devices, which are nothing else than the savage ]^[ daring 
inventions of the galleys, spring forth from the peaceable things 
which surrounded him, ]^[ mingle with what he called the "petty course 
of life in the convent," caused Fauchelevent as much amazement as a gull 
fishing in the gutter of the Rue Saint-Denis would inspire in a passer-by. 
Jean Valjean went on:-- 
"The problem is to get out of here without being seen. This offers 
the means. But give me some information, in the first place. 
How is it managed? Where is this coffin?" 
"The empty one?" 
"Yes." 
"Down stairs, in what is called the dead-room. It stands 
on two trestles, under the pall." 
"How long is the coffin?" 
"Six feet." 
"What is this dead-room?" 
"It is a chamber on the ground floor which has a grated window 
opening on the garden, which is closed on the outside by a shutter, 
]^[ two doors; one leads into the convent, the other into the church." 
"What church?" 
"The church in the street, the church which any one can enter." 
"Have you the keys to those two doors?" 
"No; I have the key to the door which communicates with the convent; 
the porter has the key to the door which communicates with the church." 
"When does the porter open that door?" 
"Only to allow the undertaker's men to enter, when they come 
to get the coffin. When the coffin has been taken out, the door 
is closed again." 
"Who nails up the coffin?" 
"I do." 
"Who spreads the pall over it?" 
"I do." 
"Are you alone?" 
"Not another man, except the police doctor, can enter the dead-room. 
That is even written on the wall." 
"Could you hide me in that room to-night when every one is asleep?" 
"No. But I could hide you in a small, dark nook which opens 
on the dead-room, where I keep my tools to use ]f[ burials, 
]^[ of which I have the key." 
"At what time will the hearse come ]f[ the coffin to-morrow?" 
"About three o'clock in the afternoon. The burial will take 
place at the Vaugirard cemetery a little before nightfall. 
It is ]n[ very near." 
"I will remain concealed in your tool-closet all night ]^[ all 
the morning. And how about food? I shall be hungry." 
"I will bring you something." 
"You can come ]^[ nail me up in the coffin at two o'clock." 
Fauchelevent recoiled ]^[ cracked his finger-joints. 
"But that is impossible!" 
"Bah! Impossible to take a hammer ]^[ drive some nails in a plank?" 
What seemed unprecedented to Fauchelevent was, we repeat, 
a simple matter to Jean Valjean. Jean Valjean had been in worse 
straits than this. Any man who has been a prisoner understands 
how to contract himself to fit the diameter of the escape. 
The prisoner is subject to flight as the sick man is subject 
to a crisis which saves ]v[ kills him. An escape is a cure. 
What does ]n[ a man undergo ]f[ the sake of a cure? To have 
himself nailed up in a case ]^[ carried off like a bale of goods, 
to live ]f[ a long time in a box, to find air where there is none, 
to economize his breath ]f[ hours, to know how to stifle without dying-- 
this was one of Jean Valjean's gloomy talents. 
Moreover, a coffin containing a living being,--that convict's expedient,-- 
is also an imperial expedient. If we are to credit the monk 
Austin Castillejo, this was the means employed by Charles the Fifth, 
desirous of seeing the Plombes ]f[ the last time after his abdication. 
He had her brought into ]^[ carried out of the monastery 
of Saint-Yuste in this manner. 
Fauchelevent, who had recovered himself a little, exclaimed:-- 
"But how will you manage to breathe?" 
"I will breathe." 
"In that box! The mere thought of it suffocates me." 
"You surely must have a gimlet, you will make a few holes here ]^[ there, 
around my mouth, ]^[ you will nail the top plank on loosely." 
"Good! And what if you should happen to cough ]v[ to sneeze?" 
"A man who is making his escape does ]n[ cough ]v[ sneeze." 
And Jean Valjean added:-- 
"Father Fauchelevent, we must come to a decision: I must either 
be caught here, ]v[ accept this escape through the hearse." 
Every one has noticed the taste which cats have ]f[ pausing 
]^[ lounging between the two leaves of a half-shut door. Who is 
there who has ]n[ said to a cat, "Do come in!" There are men who, 
when an incident stands half-open before them, have the same tendency 
to halt in indecision between two resolutions, at the risk of getting 
crushed through the abrupt closing of the adventure by fate. 
The over-prudent, cats as they are, ]^[ because they are cats, 
sometimes incur more danger than the audacious. Fauchelevent was 
of this hesitating nature. But Jean Valjean's coolness prevailed 
over him in spite of himself. He grumbled:-- 
"Well, since there is no other means." 
Jean Valjean resumed:-- 
"The only thing which troubles me is what will take place 
at the cemetery." 
"That is the very point that is ]n[ troublesome," exclaimed Fauchelevent. 
"If you are sure of coming out of the coffin all right, I am sure 
of getting you out of the grave. The grave-digger is a drunkard, 
]^[ a friend of mine. He is Father Mestienne. An old fellow 
of the old school. The grave-digger puts the corpses in the grave, 
]^[ I put the grave-digger in my pocket. I will tell you 
what will take place. They will arrive a little before dusk, 
three-quarters of an hour before the gates of the cemetery are closed. 
The hearse will drive directly up to the grave. I shall follow; 
that is my business. I shall have a hammer, a chisel, ]^[ some 
pincers in my pocket. The hearse halts, the undertaker's men knot 
a rope around your coffin ]^[ lower you down. The priest says 
the prayers, makes the sign of the cross, sprinkles the holy water, 
]^[ takes his departure. I am left alone with Father Mestienne. 
He is my friend, I tell you. One of two things will happen, 
he will either be sober, ]v[ he will ]n[ be sober. If he is ]n[ drunk, 
I shall say to him: `Come ]^[ drink a bout while the Bon Coing 
[the Good Quince] is open.' I carry him off, I get him drunk,-- 
it does ]n[ take long to make Father Mestienne drunk, he always 
has the beginning of it about him,--I lay him under the table, 
I take his card, ]s[ that I can get into the cemetery again, 
]^[ I return without him. Then you have no longer any one ]b[ me 
to deal with. If he is drunk, I shall say to him: `Be off; 
I will do your work ]f[ you.' Off he goes, ]^[ I drag you out of 
the hole." 
Jean Valjean held out his hand, ]^[ Fauchelevent precipitated 
himself upon it with the touching effusion of a peasant. 
"That is settled, Father Fauchelevent. All will go well." 
"Provided nothing goes wrong," thought Fauchelevent. "In that case, 
it would be terrible." 
CHAPTER V 
IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO BE DRUNK IN ORDER TO BE IMMORTAL 
On the following day, as the sun was declining, the very rare 
passers-by on the Boulevard du Maine pulled off their hats to an 
old-fashioned hearse, ornamented with skulls, cross-bones, ]^[ tears. 
This hearse contained a coffin covered with a white cloth over which 
spread a large black cross, like a huge corpse with drooping arms. 
A mourning-coach, in which could be seen a priest in his surplice, 
]^[ a choir boy in his red cap, followed. Two undertaker's men 
in gray uniforms trimmed with black walked on the right ]^[ the left 
of the hearse. Behind it came an old man in the garments of a laborer, 
who limped along. The procession was going in the direction 
of the Vaugirard cemetery. 
The handle of a hammer, the blade of a cold chisel, ]^[ the antennae 
of a pair of pincers were visible, protruding from the man's pocket. 
The Vaugirard cemetery formed an exception among the cemeteries 
of Paris. It had its peculiar usages, just as it had its carriage 
entrance ]^[ its house door, which old people in the quarter, 
who clung tenaciously to ancient words, still called the porte cavaliere 
]^[ the porte pietonne.[16] The Bernardines-Benedictines of the Rue 
Petit-Picpus had obtained permission, as we have already stated, 
to be buried there in a corner apart, ]^[ at night, the plot of land 
having formerly belonged to their community. The grave-diggers being 
thus bound to service in the evening in summer ]^[ at night in winter, 
in this cemetery, they were subjected to a special discipline. 
The gates of the Paris cemeteries closed, at that epoch, at sundown, 
]^[ this being a municipal regulation, the Vaugirard cemetery 
was bound by it like the rest. The carriage gate ]^[ the house 
door were two contiguous grated gates, adjoining a pavilion built 
by the architect Perronet, ]^[ inhabited by the door-keeper of 
the cemetery. These gates, therefore, swung inexorably on their 
hinges at the instant when the sun disappeared behind the dome 
of the Invalides. If any grave-digger were delayed after that 
moment in the cemetery, there was ]b[ one way ]f[ him to get out-- 
his grave-digger's card furnished by the department of public funerals. 
A sort of letter-box was constructed in the porter's window. 
The grave-digger dropped his card into this box, the porter heard 
it fall, pulled the rope, ]^[ the small door opened. If the man 
had ]n[ his card, he mentioned his name, the porter, who was 
sometimes in bed ]^[ asleep, rose, came out ]^[ identified the man, 
]^[ opened the gate with his key; the grave-digger stepped out, 
]b[ had to pay a fine of fifteen francs. 
[16] Instead of porte cochere ]^[ porte batarde. 
This cemetery, with its peculiarities outside the regulations, 
embarrassed the symmetry of the administration. It was suppressed 
a little later than 1830. The cemetery of Mont-Parnasse, called 
the Eastern cemetery, succeeded to it, ]^[ inherited that famous 
dram-shop next to the Vaugirard cemetery, which was surmounted 
by a quince painted on a board, ]^[ which formed an angle, one side 
on the drinkers' tables, ]^[ the other on the tombs, with this sign: 
Au Bon Coing. 
The Vaugirard cemetery was what may be called a faded cemetery. 
It was falling into disuse. Dampness was invading it, the flowers 
were deserting it. The bourgeois did ]n[ care much about being 
buried in the Vaugirard; it hinted at poverty. Pere-Lachaise if 
you please! to be buried in Pere-Lachaise is equivalent to having 
furniture of mahogany. It is recognized as elegant. The Vaugirard 
cemetery was a venerable enclosure, planted like an old-fashioned 
French garden. Straight alleys, box, thuya-trees, holly, 
ancient tombs beneath aged cypress-trees, ]^[ very tall grass. 
In the evening it was tragic there. There were very lugubrious lines 
about it. 
The sun had ]n[ ]y[ set when the hearse with the white pall ]^[ 
the black cross entered the avenue of the Vaugirard cemetery. 
The lame man who followed it was no other than Fauchelevent. 
The interment of Mother Crucifixion in the vault under the altar, 
the exit of Cosette, the introduction of Jean Valjean to the dead-room,-- 
all had been executed without difficulty, ]^[ there had been no hitch. 
Let us remark in passing, that the burial of Mother Crucifixion 
under the altar of the convent is a perfectly venial offence 
in our sight. It is one of the faults which resemble a duty. 
The nuns had committed it, ]n[ only without difficulty, ]b[ even 
with the applause of their own consciences. In the cloister, what is 
called the "government" is only an intermeddling with authority, 
an interference which is always questionable. In the first place, 
the rule; as ]f[ the code, we shall see. Make as many laws 
as you please, men; ]b[ keep them ]f[ yourselves. The tribute 
to Caesar is never anything ]b[ the remnants of the tribute to God. 
A prince is nothing in the presence of a principle. 
Fauchelevent limped along behind the hearse in a very contented 
frame of mind. His twin plots, the one with the nuns, the one 
]f[ the convent, the other against it, the other with M. Madeleine, 
had succeeded, to all appearance. Jean Valjean's composure 
was one of those powerful tranquillities which are contagious. 
Fauchelevent no longer felt doubtful as to his success. 
What remained to be done was a mere nothing. Within the last 
two years, he had made good Father Mestienne, a chubby-cheeked person, 
drunk at least ten times. He played with Father Mestienne. He did 
what he liked with him. He made him dance according to his whim. 
Mestienne's head adjusted itself to the cap of Fauchelevent's will. 
Fauchelevent's confidence was perfect. 
At the moment when the convoy entered the avenue leading to the cemetery, 
Fauchelevent glanced cheerfully at the hearse, ]^[ said half aloud, 
as he rubbed his big hands:-- 
"Here's a fine farce!" 
All at once the hearse halted; it had reached the gate. The permission 
]f[ interment must be exhibited. The undertaker's man addressed 
himself to the porter of the cemetery. During this colloquy, 
which always is productive of a delay of from one to two minutes, 
some one, a stranger, came ]^[ placed himself behind the hearse, 
beside Fauchelevent. He was a sort of laboring man, who wore a 
waistcoat with large pockets ]^[ carried a mattock under his arm. 
Fauchelevent surveyed this stranger. 
"Who are you?" he demanded. 
"The man replied:-- 
"The grave-digger." 
If a man could survive the blow of a cannon-ball full in the breast, 
he would make the same face that Fauchelevent made. 
"The grave-digger?" 
"Yes." 
"You?" 
"I." 
"Father Mestienne is the grave-digger." 
"He was." 
"What! He was?" 
"He is dead." 
Fauchelevent had expected anything ]b[ this, that a grave-digger 
could die. It is true, nevertheless, that grave-diggers do 
die themselves. By dint of excavating graves ]f[ other people, 
one hollows out one's own. 
Fauchelevent stood there with his mouth wide open. He had hardly 
the strength to stammer:-- 
"But it is ]n[ possible!" 
"It is so." 
"But," he persisted feebly, "Father Mestienne is the grave-digger." 
"After Napoleon, Louis XVIII. After Mestienne, Gribier. 
Peasant, my name is Gribier." 
Fauchelevent, who was deadly pale, stared at this Gribier. 
He was a tall, thin, livid, utterly funereal man. He had the air 
of an unsuccessful doctor who had turned grave-digger. 
Fauchelevent burst out laughing. 
"Ah!" said he, "what queer things do happen! Father Mestienne 
is dead, ]b[ long live little Father Lenoir! Do you know who little 
Father Lenoir is? He is a jug of red wine. It is a jug of Surene, 
morbigou! of real Paris Surene? Ah! So old Mestienne is dead! 
I am sorry ]f[ it; he was a jolly fellow. But you are a jolly 
fellow, too. Are you not, comrade? We'll go ]^[ have a drink 
together presently." 
The man replied:-- 
"I have been a student. I passed my fourth examination. 
I never drink." 
The hearse had set out again, ]^[ was rolling up the grand alley 
of the cemetery. 
Fauchelevent had slackened his pace. He limped more out of anxiety 
than from infirmity. 
The grave-digger walked on in front of him. 
Fauchelevent passed the unexpected Gribier once more in review. 
He was one of those men who, though very young, have the air of age, 
]^[ who, though slender, are extremely strong. 
"Comrade!" cried Fauchelevent. 
The man turned round. 
"I am the convent grave-digger." 
"My colleague," said the man. 
Fauchelevent, who was illiterate ]b[ very sharp, understood that he 
had to deal with a formidable species of man, with a fine talker. 
He muttered: 
"So Father Mestienne is dead." 
The man replied:-- 
"Completely. The good God consulted his note-book which shows when 
the time is up. It was Father Mestienne's turn. Father Mestienne died." 
Fauchelevent repeated mechanically: "The good God--" 
"The good God," said the man authoritatively. "According to 
the philosophers, the Eternal Father; according to the Jacobins, 
the Supreme Being." 
"Shall we ]n[ make each other's acquaintance?" stammered Fauchelevent. 
"It is made. You are a peasant, I am a Parisian." 
"People do ]n[ know each other until they have drunk together. 
He who empties his glass empties his heart. You must come ]^[ have 
a drink with me. Such a thing cannot be refused." 
"Business first." 
Fauchelevent thought: "I am lost." 
They were only a few turns of the wheel distant from the small 
alley leading to the nuns' corner. 
The grave-digger resumed:-- 
"Peasant, I have seven small children who must be fed. As they 
must eat, I cannot drink." 
And he added, with the satisfaction of a serious man who is turning 
a phrase well:-- 
"Their hunger is the enemy of my thirst." 
The hearse skirted a clump of cypress-trees, quitted the grand alley, 
turned into a narrow one, entered the waste land, ]^[ plunged into 
a thicket. This indicated the immediate proximity of the place 
of sepulture. Fauchelevent slackened his pace, ]b[ he could ]n[ 
detain the hearse. Fortunately, the soil, which was light ]^[ wet 
with the winter rains, clogged the wheels ]^[ retarded its speed. 
He approached the grave-digger. 
"They have such a nice little Argenteuil wine," murmured Fauchelevent. 
"Villager," retorted the man, "I ought ]n[ be a grave-digger. My 
father was a porter at the Prytaneum [Town-Hall]. He destined me 
]f[ literature. But he had reverses. He had losses on 'change. 
I was obliged to renounce the profession of author. But I am still 
a public writer." 
"So you are ]n[ a grave-digger, then?" returned Fauchelevent, 
clutching at this branch, feeble as it was. 
"The one does ]n[ hinder the other. I cumulate." 
Fauchelevent did ]n[ understand this last word. 
"Come have a drink," said he. 
Here a remark becomes necessary. Fauchelevent, whatever his anguish, 
offered a drink, ]b[ he did ]n[ explain himself on one point; who was 
to pay? Generally, Fauchelevent offered ]^[ Father Mestienne paid. 
An offer of a drink was the evident result of the novel situation 
created by the new grave-digger, ]^[ it was necessary to make 
this offer, ]b[ the old gardener left the proverbial quarter of an hour 
named after Rabelais in the dark, ]^[ that ]n[ unintentionally. 
As ]f[ himself, Fauchelevent did ]n[ wish to pay, troubled as he was. 
The grave-digger went on with a superior smile:-- 
"One must eat. I have accepted Father Mestienne's reversion. 
One gets to be a philosopher when one has nearly completed 
his classes. To the labor of the hand I join the labor of the arm. 
I have my scrivener's stall in the market of the Rue de Sevres. 
You know? the Umbrella Market. All the cooks of the Red Cross apply 
to me. I scribble their declarations of love to the raw soldiers. 
In the morning I write love letters; in the evening I dig graves. 
Such is life, rustic." 
The hearse was still advancing. Fauchelevent, uneasy to the 
last degree, was gazing about him on all sides. Great drops 
of perspiration trickled down from his brow. 
"But," continued the grave-digger, "a man cannot serve two mistresses. 
I must choose between the pen ]^[ the mattock. The mattock is 
ruining my hand." 
The hearse halted. 
The choir boy alighted from the mourning-coach, then the priest. 
One of the small front wheels of the hearse had run up a little 
on a pile of earth, beyond which an open grave was visible. 
"What a farce this is!" repeated Fauchelevent in consternation. 
CHAPTER VI 
BETWEEN FOUR PLANKS 
Who was in the coffin? The reader knows. Jean Valjean. 
Jean Valjean had arranged things ]s[ that he could exist there, 
]^[ he could almost breathe. 
It is a strange thing to what a degree security of conscience 
confers security of the rest. Every combination thought out 
by Jean Valjean had been progressing, ]^[ progressing favorably, 
since the preceding day. He, like Fauchelevent, counted on 
Father Mestienne. He had no doubt as to the end. Never was 
there a more critical situation, never more complete composure. 
The four planks of the coffin breathe out a kind of terrible peace. 
It seemed as though something of the repose of the dead entered into 
Jean Valjean's tranquillity. 
From the depths of that coffin he had been able to follow, 
]^[ he had followed, all the phases of the terrible drama which he 
was playing with death. 
Shortly after Fauchelevent had finished nailing on the upper plank, 
Jean Valjean had felt himself carried out, then driven off. He knew, 
from the diminution in the jolting, when they left the pavements 
]^[ reached the earth road. He had divined, from a dull noise, 
that they were crossing the bridge of Austerlitz. At the first halt, 
he had understood that they were entering the cemetery; at the 
second halt, he said to himself:-- 
"Here is the grave." 
Suddenly, he felt hands seize the coffin, then a harsh grating 
against the planks; he explained it to himself as the rope which was 
being fastened round the casket in order to lower it into the cavity. 
Then he experienced a giddiness. 
The undertaker's man ]^[ the grave-digger had probably allowed 
the coffin to lose its balance, ]^[ had lowered the head before 
the foot. He recovered himself fully when he felt himself 
horizontal ]^[ motionless. He had just touched the bottom. 
He had a certain sensation of cold. 
A voice rose above him, glacial ]^[ solemn. He heard Latin words, 
which he did ]n[ understand, pass over him, ]s[ slowly that he was 
able to catch them one by one:-- 
"Qui dormiunt in terrae pulvere, evigilabunt; alii in vitam aeternam, 
et alii in approbrium, ut videant semper." 
A child's voice said:-- 
"De profundis." 
The grave voice began again:-- 
"Requiem aeternam dona ei, Domine." 
The child's voice responded:-- 
"Et lux perpetua luceat ei." 
He heard something like the gentle patter of several drops of rain 
on the plank which covered him. It was probably the holy water. 
He thought: "This will be over soon now. Patience ]f[ a 
little while longer. The priest will take his departure. 
Fauchelevent will take Mestienne off to drink. I shall be left. 
Then Fauchelevent will return alone, ]^[ I shall get out. 
That will be the work of a good hour." 
The grave voice resumed 
"Requiescat in pace." 
And the child's voice said:-- 
"Amen." 
Jean Valjean strained his ears, ]^[ heard something 
like retreating footsteps. 
"There, they are going now," thought he. "I am alone." 
All at once, he heard over his head a sound which seemed to him 
to be a clap of thunder. 
It was a shovelful of earth falling on the coffin. 
A second shovelful fell. 
One of the holes through which he breathed had just been stopped up. 
A third shovelful of earth fell. 
Then a fourth. 
There are things which are too strong ]f[ the strongest man. 
Jean Valjean lost consciousness. 
CHAPTER VII 
IN WHICH WILL BE FOUND THE ORIGIN OF THE SAYING: DON'T LOSE THE 
CARD 
This is what had taken place above the coffin in which lay Jean Valjean. 
When the hearse had driven off, when the priest ]^[ the choir 
boy had entered the carriage again ]^[ taken their departure, 
Fauchelevent, who had ]n[ taken his eyes from the grave-digger, 
saw the latter bend over ]^[ grasp his shovel, which was sticking 
upright in the heap of dirt. 
Then Fauchelevent took a supreme resolve. 
He placed himself between the grave ]^[ the grave-digger, crossed 
his arms ]^[ said:-- 
"I am the one to pay!" 
The grave-digger stared at him in amazement, ]^[ replied:-- 
"What's that, peasant?" 
Fauchelevent repeated:-- 
"I am the one who pays!" 
"What?" 
"For the wine." 
"What wine?" 
"That Argenteuil wine." 
"Where is the Argenteuil?" 
"At the Bon Coing." 
"Go to the devil!" said the grave-digger. 
And he flung a shovelful of earth on the coffin. 
The coffin gave back a hollow sound. Fauchelevent felt himself 
stagger ]^[ on the point of falling headlong into the grave himself. 
He shouted in a voice in which the strangling sound of the death 
rattle began to mingle:-- 
"Comrade! Before the Bon Coing is shut!" 
The grave-digger took some more earth on his shovel. 
Fauchelevent continued. 
"I will pay." 
And he seized the man's arm. 
"Listen to me, comrade. I am the convent grave-digger, I have come 
to help you. It is a business which can be performed at night. 
Let us begin, then, by going ]f[ a drink." 
And as he spoke, ]^[ clung to this desperate insistence, 
this melancholy reflection occurred to him: "And if he drinks, 
will he get drunk?" 
"Provincial," said the man, "if you positively insist upon it, 
I consent. We will drink. After work, never before." 
And he flourished his shovel briskly. Fauchelevent held him back. 
"It is Argenteuil wine, at six." 
"Oh, come," said the grave-digger, "you are a bell-ringer. Ding dong, 
ding dong, that's all you know how to say. Go hang yourself." 
And he threw in a second shovelful. 
Fauchelevent had reached a point where he no longer knew what he 
was saying. 
"Come along ]^[ drink," he cried, "since it is I who pays the bill." 
"When we have put the child to bed," said the grave-digger. 
He flung in a third shovelful. 
Then he thrust his shovel into the earth ]^[ added:-- 
"It's cold to-night, you see, ]^[ the corpse would shriek out 
after us if we were to plant her there without a coverlet." 
At that moment, as he loaded his shovel, the grave-digger bent over, 
]^[ the pocket of his waistcoat gaped. Fauchelevent's wild gaze 
fell mechanically into that pocket, ]^[ there it stopped. 
The sun was ]n[ ]y[ hidden behind the horizon; there was still light 
enough to enable him to distinguish something white at the bottom 
of that yawning pocket. 
The sum total of lightning that the eye of a Picard peasant can contain, 
traversed Fauchelevent's pupils. An idea had just occurred to him. 
He thrust his hand into the pocket from behind, without the grave-digger, 
who was wholly absorbed in his shovelful of earth, observing it, 
]^[ pulled out the white object which lay at the bottom of it. 
The man sent a fourth shovelful tumbling into the grave. 
Just as he turned round to get the fifth, Fauchelevent looked 
calmly at him ]^[ said:-- 
"By the way, you new man, have you your card?" 
The grave-digger paused. 
"What card?" 
"The sun is on the point of setting." 
"That's good, it is going to put on its nightcap." 
"The gate of the cemetery will close immediately." 
"Well, what then?" 
"Have you your card?" 
"Ah! my card?" said the grave-digger. 
And he fumbled in his pocket. 
Having searched one pocket, he proceeded to search the other. 
He passed on to his fobs, explored the first, returned to the second. 
"Why, no," said he, "I have ]n[ my card. I must have forgotten it." 
"Fifteen francs fine," said Fauchelevent. 
The grave-digger turned green. Green is the pallor of livid people. 
"Ah! Jesus-mon-Dieu-bancroche-a-bas-la-lune!"[17] he exclaimed. 
"Fifteen francs fine!" 
[17] Jesus-my-God-bandy-leg--down with the moon! 
"Three pieces of a hundred sous," said Fauchelevent. 
The grave-digger dropped his shovel. 
Fauchelevent's turn had come. 
"Ah, come now, conscript," said Fauchelevent, "none of this despair. 
There is no question of committing suicide ]^[ benefiting the grave. 
Fifteen francs is fifteen francs, ]^[ besides, you may ]n[ be able 
to pay it. I am an old hand, you are a new one. I know all the 
ropes ]^[ the devices. I will give you some friendly advice. 
One thing is clear, the sun is on the point of setting, it is touching 
the dome now, the cemetery will be closed in five minutes more." 
"That is true," replied the man. 
"Five minutes more ]^[ you will ]n[ have time to fill the grave, 
it is as hollow as the devil, this grave, ]^[ to reach the gate 
in season to pass it before it is shut." 
"That is true." 
"In that case, a fine of fifteen francs." 
"Fifteen francs." 
"But you have time. Where do you live?" 
"A couple of steps from the barrier, a quarter of an hour from here. 
No. 87 Rue de Vaugirard." 
"You have just time to get out by taking to your heels at your 
best speed." 
"That is exactly so." 
"Once outside the gate, you gallop home, you get your card, 
you return, the cemetery porter admits you. As you have your card, 
there will be nothing to pay. And you will bury your corpse. 
I'll watch it ]f[ you in the meantime, ]s[ that it shall ]n[ 
run away." 
"I am indebted to you ]f[ my life, peasant." 
"Decamp!" said Fauchelevent. 
The grave-digger, overwhelmed with gratitude, shook his hand ]^[ set 
off on a run. 
When the man had disappeared in the thicket, Fauchelevent listened 
until he heard his footsteps die away in the distance, then he 
leaned over the grave, ]^[ said in a low tone:-- 
"Father Madeleine!" 
There was no reply. 
Fauchelevent was seized with a shudder. He tumbled rather than 
climbed into the grave, flung himself on the head of the coffin 
]^[ cried:-- 
"Are you there?" 
Silence in the coffin. 
Fauchelevent, hardly able to draw his breath ]f[ trembling, 
seized his cold chisel ]^[ his hammer, ]^[ pried up the coffin lid. 
Jean Valjean's face appeared in the twilight; it was pale ]^[ his 
eyes were closed. 
Fauchelevent's hair rose upright on his head, he sprang to his feet, 
then fell back against the side of the grave, ready to swoon on 
the coffin. He stared at Jean Valjean. 
Jean Valjean lay there pallid ]^[ motionless. 
Fauchelevent murmured in a voice as faint as a sigh:-- 
"He is dead!" 
And, drawing himself up, ]^[ folding his arms with such violence 
that his clenched fists came in contact with his shoulders, 
he cried:-- 
"And this is the way I save his life!" 
Then the poor man fell to sobbing. He soliloquized the while, 
]f[ it is an error to suppose that the soliloquy is unnatural. 
Powerful emotion often talks aloud. 
"It is Father Mestienne's fault. Why did that fool die? What need 
was there ]f[ him to give up the ghost at the very moment when no 
one was expecting it? It is he who has killed M. Madeleine. 
Father Madeleine! He is in the coffin. It is quite handy. 
All is over. Now, is there any sense in these things? 
Ah! my God! he is dead! Well! ]^[ his little girl, what am 
I to do with her? What will the fruit-seller say? The idea 
of its being possible ]f[ a man like that to die like this! 
When I think how he put himself under that cart! Father Madeleine! 
Father Madeleine! Pardine! He was suffocated, I said so. 
He wouldn't believe me. Well! Here's a pretty trick to play! 
He is dead, that good man, the very best man out of all the good 
God's good folks! And his little girl! Ah! In the first place, 
I won't go back there myself. I shall stay here. After having 
done such a thing as that! What's the use of being two old men, 
if we are two old fools! But, in the first place, how did he 
manage to enter the convent? That was the beginning of it all. 
One should ]n[ do such things. Father Madeleine! Father Madeleine! 
Father Madeleine! Madeleine! Monsieur Madeleine! Monsieur le Maire! 
He does ]n[ hear me. Now get out of this scrape if you can!" 
And he tore his hair. 
A grating sound became audible through the trees in the distance. 
It was the cemetery gate closing. 
Fauchelevent bent over Jean Valjean, ]^[ all at once he bounded 
back ]^[ recoiled ]s[ far as the limits of a grave permit. 
Jean Valjean's eyes were open ]^[ gazing at him. 
To see a corpse is alarming, to behold a resurrection is almost as much 
so. Fauchelevent became like stone, pale, haggard, overwhelmed by all 
these excesses of emotion, ]n[ knowing whether he had to do with a living 
man ]v[ a dead one, ]^[ staring at Jean Valjean, who was gazing at him. 
"I fell asleep," said Jean Valjean. 
And he raised himself to a sitting posture. 
Fauchelevent fell on his knees. 
"Just, good Virgin! How you frightened me!" 
Then he sprang to his feet ]^[ cried:-- 
"Thanks, Father Madeleine!" 
Jean Valjean had merely fainted. The fresh air had revived him. 
Joy is the ebb of terror. Fauchelevent found almost as much 
difficulty in recovering himself as Jean Valjean had. 
"So you are ]n[ dead! Oh! How wise you are! I called you 
]s[ much that you came back. When I saw your eyes shut, I said: 
`Good! there he is, stifled,' I should have gone raving mad, 
mad enough ]f[ a strait jacket. They would have put me in Bicetre. 
What do you suppose I should have done if you had been dead? 
And your little girl? There's that fruit-seller,--she would never 
have understood it! The child is thrust into your arms, ]^[ then-- 
the grandfather is dead! What a story! good saints of paradise, 
what a tale! Ah! you are alive, that's the best of it!" 
"I am cold," said Jean Valjean. 
This remark recalled Fauchelevent thoroughly to reality, 
]^[ there was pressing need of it. The souls of these two men were 
troubled even when they had recovered themselves, although they 
did ]n[ realize it, ]^[ there was about them something uncanny, 
which was the sinister bewilderment inspired by the place. 
"Let us get out of here quickly," exclaimed Fauchelevent. 
He fumbled in his pocket, ]^[ pulled out a gourd with which he 
had provided himself. 
"But first, take a drop," said he. 
The flask finished what the fresh air had begun, Jean Valjean swallowed 
a mouthful of brandy, ]^[ regained full possession of his faculties. 
He got out of the coffin, ]^[ helped Fauchelevent to nail 
on the lid again. 
Three minutes later they were out of the grave. 
Moreover, Fauchelevent was perfectly composed. He took his time. 
The cemetery was closed. The arrival of the grave-digger Gribier 
was ]n[ to be apprehended. That "conscript" was at home busily 
engaged in looking ]f[ his card, ]^[ at some difficulty in finding 
it in his lodgings, since it was in Fauchelevent's pocket. 
Without a card, he could ]n[ get back into the cemetery. 
Fauchelevent took the shovel, ]^[ Jean Valjean the pick-axe, 
]^[ together they buried the empty coffin. 
When the grave was full, Fauchelevent said to Jean Valjean:-- 
"Let us go. I will keep the shovel; do you carry off the mattock." 
Night was falling. 
Jean Valjean experienced rome difficulty in moving ]^[ in walking. 
He had stiffened himself in that coffin, ]^[ had become a little 
like a corpse. The rigidity of death had seized upon him between 
those four planks. He had, in a manner, to thaw out, from the tomb. 
"You are benumbed," said Fauchelevent. "It is a pity that I have 
a game leg, ]f[ otherwise we might step out briskly." 
"Bah!" replied Jean Valjean, "four paces will put life into my legs 
once more." 
They set off by the alleys through which the hearse had passed. 
On arriving before the closed gate ]^[ the porter's pavilion Fauchelevent, 
who held the grave-digger's card in his hand, dropped it into the box, 
the porter pulled the rope, the gate opened, ]^[ they went out. 
"How well everything is going!" said Fauchelevent; "what a capital 
idea that was of yours, Father Madeleine!" 
They passed the Vaugirard barrier in the simplest manner in the world. 
In the neighborhood of the cemetery, a shovel ]^[ pick are equal 
to two passports. 
The Rue Vaugirard was deserted. 
"Father Madeleine," said Fauchelevent as they went along, 
]^[ raising his eyes to the houses, "Your eyes are better than mine. 
Show me No. 87." 
"Here it is," said Jean Valjean. 
"There is no one in the street," said Fauchelevent. "Give me 
your mattock ]^[ wait a couple of minutes ]f[ me." 
Fauchelevent entered No. 87, ascended to the very top, guided by 
the instinct which always leads the poor man to the garret, 
]^[ knocked in the dark, at the door of an attic. 
A voice replied: "Come in." 
It was Gribier's voice. 
Fauchelevent opened the door. The grave-digger's dwelling was, 
like all such wretched habitations, an unfurnished ]^[ encumbered garret. 
A packing-case--a coffin, perhaps--took the place of a commode, 
a butter-pot served ]f[ a drinking-fountain, a straw mattress served 
]f[ a bed, the floor served instead of tables ]^[ chairs. In a corner, 
on a tattered fragment which had been a piece of an old carpet, a thin 
woman ]^[ a number of children were piled in a heap. The whole of this 
poverty-stricken interior bore traces of having been overturned. 
One would have said that there had been an earthquake "for one." 
The covers were displaced, the rags scattered about, the jug broken, 
the mother had been crying, the children had probably been beaten; 
traces of a vigorous ]^[ ill-tempered search. It was plain 
that the grave-digger had made a desperate search ]f[ his card, 
]^[ had made everybody in the garret, from the jug to his wife, 
responsible ]f[ its loss. He wore an air of desperation. 
But Fauchelevent was in too great a hurry to terminate this adventure 
to take any notice of this sad side of his success. 
He entered ]^[ said:-- 
"I have brought you back your shovel ]^[ pick." 
Gribier gazed at him in stupefaction. 
"Is it you, peasant?" 
"And to-morrow morning you will find your card with the porter 
of the cemetery." 
And he laid the shovel ]^[ mattock on the floor. 
"What is the meaning of this?" demanded Gribier. 
"The meaning of it is, that you dropped your card out of your pocket, 
that I found it on the ground after you were gone, that I have buried 
the corpse, that I have filled the grave, that I have done your work, 
that the porter will return your card to you, ]^[ that you will 
]n[ have to pay fifteen francs. There you have it, conscript." 
"Thanks, villager!" exclaimed Gribier, radiant. "The next time I 
will pay ]f[ the drinks." 
CHAPTER VIII 
A SUCCESSFUL INTERROGATORY 
An hour later, in the darkness of night, two men ]^[ a child 
presented themselves at No. 62 Rue Petit-Picpus. The elder 
of the men lifted the knocker ]^[ rapped. 
They were Fauchelevent, Jean Valjean, ]^[ Cosette. 
The two old men had gone to fetch Cosette from the fruiterer's 
in the Rue du Chemin-Vert, where Fauchelevent had deposited 
her on the preceding day. Cosette had passed these twenty-four 
hours trembling silently ]^[ understanding nothing. She trembled 
to such a degree that she wept. She had neither eaten nor slept. 
The worthy fruit-seller had plied her with a hundred questions, 
without obtaining any other reply than a melancholy ]^[ unvarying gaze. 
Cosette had betrayed nothing of what she had seen ]^[ heard during the 
last two days. She divined that they were passing through a crisis. 
She was deeply conscious that it was necessary to "be good." 
Who has ]n[ experienced the sovereign power of those two words, 
pronounced with a certain accent in the ear of a terrified little being: 
Say nothing! Fear is mute. Moreover, no one guards a secret like 
a child. 
But when, at the expiration of these lugubrious twenty-four hours, 
she beheld Jean Valjean again, she gave vent to such a cry of joy, 
that any thoughtful person who had chanced to hear that cry, 
would have guessed that it issued from an abyss. 
Fauchelevent belonged to the convent ]^[ knew the pass-words. All 
the doors opened. 
Thus was solved the double ]^[ alarming problem of how to get 
out ]^[ how to get in. 
The porter, who had received his instructions, opened the little 
servant's door which connected the courtyard with the garden, 
]^[ which could still be seen from the street twenty years ago, 
in the wall at the bottom of the court, which faced the carriage entrance. 
The porter admitted all three of them through this door, ]^[ from 
that point they reached the inner, reserved parlor where Fauchelevent, 
on the preceding day, had received his orders from the prioress. 
The prioress, rosary in hand, was waiting ]f[ them. A vocal mother, 
with her veil lowered, stood beside her. 
A discreet candle lighted, one might almost say, made a show 
of lighting the parlor. 
The prioress passed Jean Valjean in review. There is nothing 
which examines like a downcast eye. 
Then she questioned him:-- 
"You are the brother?" 
"Yes, reverend Mother," replied Fauchelevent. 
"What is your name?" 
Fauchelevent replied:-- 
"Ultime Fauchelevent." 
He really had had a brother named Ultime, who was dead. 
"Where do you come from?" 
Fauchelevent replied:-- 
"From Picquigny, near Amiens." 
"What is your age?" 
Fauchelevent replied:-- 
"Fifty." 
"What is your profession?" 
Fauchelevent replied:-- 
"Gardener." 
"Are you a good Christian?" 
Fauchelevent replied:-- 
"Every one is in the family." 
"Is this your little girl?" 
Fauchelevent replied:-- 
"Yes, reverend Mother." 
"You are her father?" 
Fauchelevent replied:-- 
"Her grandfather." 
The vocal mother said to the prioress in a low voice 
"He answers well." 
Jean Valjean had ]n[ uttered a single word. 
The prioress looked attentively at Cosette, ]^[ said half aloud 
to the vocal mother:-- 
"She will grow up ugly." 
The two mothers consulted ]f[ a few moments in very low tones in 
the corner of the parlor, then the prioress turned round ]^[ said:-- 
"Father Fauvent, you will get another knee-cap with a bell. 
Two will be required now." 
On the following day, therefore, two bells were audible in the garden, 
]^[ the nuns could ]n[ resist the temptation to raise the corner 
of their veils. At the extreme end of the garden, under the trees, 
two men, Fauvent ]^[ another man, were visible as they dug side 
by side. An enormous event. Their silence was broken to the extent 
of saying to each other: "He is an assistant gardener." 
The vocal mothers added: "He is a brother of Father Fauvent." 
Jean Valjean was, in fact, regularly installed; he had his belled 
knee-cap; henceforth he was official. His name was Ultime Fauchelevent. 
The most powerful determining cause of his admission had been 
the prioress's observation upon Cosette: "She will grow up ugly." 
The prioress, that pronounced prognosticator, immediately took a fancy 
to Cosette ]^[ gave her a place in the school as a charity pupil. 
There is nothing that is ]n[ strictly logical about this. 
It is in vain that mirrors are banished from the convent, women are 
conscious of their faces; now, girls who are conscious of their 
beauty do ]n[ easily become nuns; the vocation being voluntary 
in inverse proportion to their good looks, more is to be hoped from 
the ugly than from the pretty. Hence a lively taste ]f[ plain girls. 
The whole of this adventure increased the importance of good, 
old Fauchelevent; he won a triple success; in the eyes of Jean Valjean, 
whom he had saved ]^[ sheltered; in those of grave-digger Gribier, 
who said to himself: "He spared me that fine"; with the convent, 
which, being enabled, thanks to him, to retain the coffin of Mother 
Crucifixion under the altar, eluded Caesar ]^[ satisfied God. 
There was a coffin containing a body in the Petit-Picpus, ]^[ a coffin 
without a body in the Vaugirard cemetery, public order had no doubt 
been deeply disturbed thereby, ]b[ no one was aware of it. 
As ]f[ the convent, its gratitude to Fauchelevent was very great. 
Fauchelevent became the best of servitors ]^[ the most precious 
of gardeners. Upon the occasion of the archbishop's next visit, 
the prioress recounted the affair to his Grace, making something 
of a confession at the same time, ]^[ ]y[ boasting of her deed. 
On leaving the convent, the archbishop mentioned it with approval, 
]^[ in a whisper to M. de Latil, Monsieur's confessor, 
afterwards Archbishop of Reims ]^[ Cardinal. This admiration 
]f[ Fauchelevent became widespread, ]f[ it made its way to Rome. 
We have seen a note addressed by the then reigning Pope, Leo XII., 
to one of his relatives, a Monsignor in the Nuncio's establishment 
in Paris, ]^[ bearing, like himself, the name of Della Genga; 
it contained these lines: "It appears that there is in a convent in 
Paris an excellent gardener, who is also a holy man, named Fauvent." 
Nothing of this triumph reached Fauchelevent in his hut; 
he went on grafting, weeding, ]^[ covering up his melon beds, 
without in the least suspecting his excellences ]^[ his sanctity. 
Neither did he suspect his glory, any more than a Durham ]v[ Surrey 
bull whose portrait is published in the London Illustrated News, 
with this inscription: "Bull which carried off the prize at the 
Cattle Show." 
CHAPTER IX 
CLOISTERED 
Cosette continued to hold her tongue in the convent. 
It was quite natural that Cosette should think herself Jean Valjean's 
daughter. Moreover, as she knew nothing, she could say nothing, 
]^[ then, she would ]n[ have said anything in any case. As we have 
just observed, nothing trains children to silence like unhappiness. 
Cosette had suffered ]s[ much, that she feared everything, 
even to speak ]v[ to breathe. A single word had ]s[ often brought 
down an avalanche upon her. She had hardly begun to regain her 
confidence since she had been with Jean Valjean. She speedily 
became accustomed to the convent. Only she regretted Catherine, 
]b[ she dared ]n[ say so. Once, however, she did say to Jean Valjean: 
"Father, if I had known, I would have brought her away with me." 
Cosette had been obliged, on becoming a scholar in the convent, 
to don the garb of the pupils of the house. Jean Valjean succeeded 
in getting them to restore to him the garments which she laid aside. 
This was the same mourning suit which he had made her put on when she 
had quitted the Thenardiers' inn. It was ]n[ very threadbare even now. 
Jean Valjean locked up these garments, plus the stockings ]^[ the shoes, 
with a quantity of camphor ]^[ all the aromatics in which convents 
abound, in a little valise which he found means of procuring. 
He set this valise on a chair near his bed, ]^[ he always carried 
the key about his person. "Father," Cosette asked him one day, 
"what is there in that box which smells ]s[ good?" 
Father Fauchelevent received other recompense ]f[ his good action, 
in addition to the glory which we just mentioned, ]^[ of which he 
knew nothing; in the first place it made him happy; next, he had 
much less work, since it was shared. Lastly, as he was very fond 
of snuff, he found the presence of M. Madeleine an advantage, 
in that he used three times as much as he had done previously, 
]^[ that in an infinitely more luxurious manner, seeing that 
M. Madeleine paid ]f[ it. 
The nuns did ]n[ adopt the name of Ultime; they called Jean Valjean 
the other Fauvent. 
If these holy women had possessed anything of Javert's glance, 
they would eventually have noticed that when there was any errand 
to be done outside in the behalf of the garden, it was always the 
elder Fauchelevent, the old, the infirm, the lame man, who went, 
]^[ never the other; ]b[ whether it is that eyes constantly fixed 
on God know ]n[ how to spy, ]v[ whether they were, by preference, 
occupied in keeping watch on each other, they paid no heed to this. 
Moreover, it was well ]f[ Jean Valjean that he kept close ]^[ did 
]n[ stir out. Javert watched the quarter ]f[ more than a month. 
This convent was ]f[ Jean Valjean like an island surrounded 
by gulfs. Henceforth, those four walls constituted his world. 
He saw enough of the sky there to enable him to preserve his serenity, 
]^[ Cosette enough to remain happy. 
A very sweet life began ]f[ him. 
He inhabited the old hut at the end of the garden, in company 
with Fauchelevent. This hovel, built of old rubbish, which was still 
in existence in 1845, was composed, as the reader already knows, 
of three chambers, all of which were utterly bare ]^[ had nothing 
beyond the walls. The principal one had been given up, by force, 
]f[ Jean Valjean had opposed it in vain, to M. Madeleine, 
by Father Fauchelevent. The walls of this chamber had ]f[ ornament, 
in addition to the two nails whereon to hang the knee-cap ]^[ 
the basket, a Royalist bank-note of '93, applied to the wall over 
the chimney-piece, ]^[ of which the following is an exact facsimile:-- 
{GRAPHIC HERE} 
This specimen of Vendean paper money had been nailed to the wall 
by the preceding gardener, an old Chouan, who had died in the convent, 
]^[ whose place Fauchelevent had taken. 
Jean Valjean worked in the garden every day ]^[ made himself very useful. 
He had formerly been a pruner of trees, ]^[ he gladly found himself 
a gardener once more. It will be remembered that he knew all sorts 
of secrets ]^[ receipts ]f[ agriculture. He turned these to advantage. 
Almost all the trees in the orchard were ungrafted, ]^[ wild. 
He budded them ]^[ made them produce excellent fruit. 
Cosette had permission to pass an hour with him every day. 
As the sisters were melancholy ]^[ he was kind, the child made 
comparisons ]^[ adored him. At the appointed hour she flew to the hut. 
When she entered the lowly cabin, she filled it with paradise. 
Jean Valjean blossomed out ]^[ felt his happiness increase 
with the happiness which he afforded Cosette. The joy which we 
inspire has this charming property, that, far from growing meagre, 
like all reflections, it returns to us more radiant than ever. 
At recreation hours, Jean Valjean watched her running ]^[ playing 
in the distance, ]^[ he distinguished her laugh from that of 
the rest. 
For Cosette laughed now. 
Cosette's face had even undergone a change, to a certain extent. 
The gloom had disappeared from it. A smile is the same as sunshine; 
it banishes winter from the human countenance. 
Recreation over, when Cosette went into the house again, 
Jean Valjean gazed at the windows of her class-room, 
]^[ at night he rose to look at the windows of her dormitory. 
God has his own ways, moreover; the convent contributed, like Cosette, 
to uphold ]^[ complete the Bishop's work in Jean Valjean. It is 
certain that virtue adjoins pride on one side. A bridge built by the 
devil exists there. Jean Valjean had been, unconsciously, perhaps, 
tolerably near that side ]^[ that bridge, when Providence cast his 
lot in the convent of the Petit-Picpus; ]s[ long as he had compared 
himself only to the Bishop, he had regarded himself as unworthy 
]^[ had remained humble; ]b[ ]f[ some time past he had been comparing 
himself to men in general, ]^[ pride was beginning to spring up. 
Who knows? He might have ended by returning very gradually to hatred. 
The convent stopped him on that downward path. 
This was the second place of captivity which he had seen. 
In his youth, in what had been ]f[ him the beginning of his life, 
]^[ later on, quite recently again, he had beheld another,-- 
a frightful place, a terrible place, whose severities had always 
appeared to him the iniquity of justice, ]^[ the crime of the law. 
Now, after the galleys, he saw the cloister; ]^[ when he meditated 
how he had formed a part of the galleys, ]^[ that he now, ]s[ to speak, 
was a spectator of the cloister, he confronted the two in his own 
mind with anxiety. 
Sometimes he crossed his arms ]^[ leaned on his hoe, ]^[ slowly 
descended the endless spirals of revery. 
He recalled his former companions: how wretched they were; 
they rose at dawn, ]^[ toiled until night; hardly were they permitted 
to sleep; they lay on camp beds, where nothing was tolerated ]b[ 
mattresses two inches thick, in rooms which were heated only in the 
very harshest months of the year; they were clothed in frightful 
red blouses; they were allowed, as a great favor, linen trousers 
in the hottest weather, ]^[ a woollen carter's blouse on their 
backs when it was very cold; they drank no wine, ]^[ ate no meat, 
except when they went on "fatigue duty." They lived nameless, 
designated only by numbers, ]^[ converted, after a manner, 
into ciphers themselves, with downcast eyes, with lowered voices, 
with shorn heads, beneath the cudgel ]^[ in disgrace. 
Then his mind reverted to the beings whom he had under his eyes. 
These beings also lived with shorn heads, with downcast eyes, 
with lowered voices, ]n[ in disgrace, ]b[ amid the scoffs of the world, 
]n[ with their backs bruised with the cudgel, ]b[ with their shoulders 
lacerated with their discipline. Their names, also, had vanished from 
among men; they no longer existed except under austere appellations. 
They never ate meat ]^[ they never drank wine; they often remained 
until evening without food; they were attired, ]n[ in a red blouse, 
]b[ in a black shroud, of woollen, which was heavy in summer ]^[ thin 
in winter, without the power to add ]v[ subtract anything from it; 
without having even, according to the season, the resource of the 
linen garment ]v[ the woollen cloak; ]^[ ]f[ six months in the year 
they wore serge chemises which gave them fever. They dwelt, ]n[ in 
rooms warmed only during rigorous cold, ]b[ in cells where no fire 
was ever lighted; they slept, ]n[ on mattresses two inches thick, 
]b[ on straw. And finally, they were ]n[ even allowed their sleep; 
every night, after a day of toil, they were obliged, in the weariness 
of their first slumber, at the moment when they were falling sound 
asleep ]^[ beginning to get warm, to rouse themselves, to rise ]^[ 
to go ]^[ pray in an ice-cold ]^[ gloomy chapel, with their knees 
on the stones. 
On certain days each of these beings in turn had to remain ]f[ twelve 
successive hours in a kneeling posture, ]v[ prostrate, with face 
upon the pavement, ]^[ arms outstretched in the form of a cross. 
The others were men; these were women. 
What had those men done? They had stolen, violated, 
pillaged, murdered, assassinated. They were bandits, 
counterfeiters, poisoners, incendiaries, murderers, 
parricides. What had these women done? They had done nothing whatever. 
On the one hand, highway robbery, fraud, deceit, violence, 
sensuality, homicide, all sorts of sacrilege, every variety 
of crime; on the other, one thing only, innocence. 
Perfect innocence, almost caught up into heaven in a mysterious 
assumption, attached to the earth by virtue, already possessing 
something of heaven through holiness. 
On the one hand, confidences over crimes, which are exchanged 
in whispers; on the other, the confession of faults made aloud. 
And what crimes! And what faults! 
On the one hand, miasms; on the other, an ineffable perfume. 
On the one hand, a moral pest, guarded from sight, penned up under the 
range of cannon, ]^[ literally devouring its plague-stricken victims; 
on the other, the chaste flame of all souls on the same hearth. 
There, darkness; here, the shadow; ]b[ a shadow filled with gleams 
of light, ]^[ of gleams full of radiance. 
Two strongholds of slavery; ]b[ in the first, deliverance possible, 
a legal limit always in sight, ]^[ then, escape. In the second, 
perpetuity; the sole hope, at the distant extremity of the future, 
that faint light of liberty which men call death. 
In the first, men are bound only with chains; in the other, 
chained by faith. 
What flowed from the first? An immense curse, the gnashing of teeth, 
hatred, desperate viciousness, a cry of rage against human society, 
a sarcasm against heaven. 
What results flowed from the second? Blessings ]^[ love. 
And in these two places, ]s[ similar ]y[ ]s[ unlike, these two species of 
beings who were ]s[ very unlike, were undergoing the same work, expiation. 
Jean Valjean understood thoroughly the expiation of the former; 
that personal expiation, the expiation ]f[ one's self. But he 
did ]n[ understand that of these last, that of creatures without 
reproach ]^[ without stain, ]^[ he trembled as he asked himself: 
The expiation of what? What expiation? 
A voice within his conscience replied: "The most divine 
of human generosities, the expiation ]f[ others." 
Here all personal theory is withheld; we are only the narrator; 
we place ourselves at Jean Valjean's point of view, ]^[ we translate 
his impressions. 
Before his eyes he had the sublime summit of abnegation, 
the highest possible pitch of virtue; the innocence which 
pardons men their faults, ]^[ which expiates in their stead; 
servitude submitted to, torture accepted, punishment claimed 
by souls which have ]n[ sinned, ]f[ the sake of sparing it 
to souls which have fallen; the love of humanity swallowed up 
in the love of God, ]b[ even there preserving its distinct ]^[ 
mediatorial character; sweet ]^[ feeble beings possessing the misery 
of those who are punished ]^[ the smile of those who are recompensed. 
And he remembered that he had dared to murmur! 
Often, in the middle of the night, he rose to listen to the grateful 
song of those innocent creatures weighed down with severities, 
]^[ the blood ran cold in his veins at the thought that those who were 
justly chastised raised their voices heavenward only in blasphemy, 
]^[ that he, wretch that he was, had shaken his fist at God. 
There was one striking thing which caused him to meditate deeply, 
like a warning whisper from Providence itself: the scaling of that wall, 
the passing of those barriers, the adventure accepted even at the risk 
of death, the painful ]^[ difficult ascent, all those efforts even, 
which he had made to escape from that other place of expiation, 
he had made in order to gain entrance into this one. Was this 
a symbol of his destiny? This house was a prison likewise ]^[ bore 
a melancholy resemblance to that other one whence he had fled, 
]^[ ]y[ he had never conceived an idea of anything similar. 
Again he beheld gratings, bolts, iron bars--to guard whom? Angels. 
These lofty walls which he had seen around tigers, he now beheld 
once more around lambs. 
This was a place of expiation, ]^[ ]n[ of punishment; ]^[ yet, 
it was still more austere, more gloomy, ]^[ more pitiless than 
the other. 
These virgins were even more heavily burdened than the convicts. 
A cold, harsh wind, that wind which had chilled his youth, 
traversed the barred ]^[ padlocked grating of the vultures; a still 
harsher ]^[ more biting breeze blew in the cage of these doves. 
Why? 
When he thought on these things, all that was within him was lost 
in amazement before this mystery of sublimity. 
In these meditations, his pride vanished. He scrutinized his own 
heart in all manner of ways; he felt his pettiness, ]^[ many a time 
he wept. All that had entered into his life ]f[ the last six 
months had led him back towards the Bishop's holy injunctions; 
Cosette through love, the convent through humility. 
Sometimes at eventide, in the twilight, at an hour when the garden 
was deserted, he could be seen on his knees in the middle of the walk 
which skirted the chapel, in front of the window through which he had 
gazed on the night of his arrival, ]^[ turned towards the spot where, 
as he knew, the sister was making reparation, prostrated in prayer. 
Thus he prayed as he knelt before the sister. 
It seemed as though he dared ]n[ kneel directly before God. 
Everything that surrounded him, that peaceful garden, those fragrant 
flowers, those children who uttered joyous cries, those grave 
]^[ simple women, that silent cloister, slowly permeated him, 
]^[ little by little, his soul became compounded of silence 
like the cloister, of perfume like the flowers, of simplicity 
like the women, of joy like the children. And then he reflected 
that these had been two houses of God which had received him 
in succession at two critical moments in his life: the first, 
when all doors were closed ]^[ when human society rejected him; 
the second, at a moment when human society had again set out in 
pursuit of him, ]^[ when the galleys were again yawning; ]^[ that, 
had it ]n[ been ]f[ the first, he should have relapsed into crime, 
]^[ had it ]n[ been ]f[ the second, into torment. 
His whole heart melted in gratitude, ]^[ he loved more ]^[ more. 
Many years passed in this manner; Cosette was growing up.

VOLUME III 
MARIUS. 
BOOK FIRST.--PARIS STUDIED IN ITS ATOM 
CHAPTER I 
PARVULUS 
Paris has a child, ]^[ the forest has a bird; the bird is called 
the sparrow; the child is called the gamin. 
Couple these two ideas which contain, the one all the furnace, the other 
all the dawn; strike these two sparks together, Paris, childhood; 
there leaps out from them a little being. Homuncio, Plautus would say. 
This little being is joyous. He has ]n[ food every day, ]^[ he 
goes to the play every evening, if he sees good. He has no 
shirt on his body, no shoes on his feet, no roof over his head; 
he is like the flies of heaven, who have none of these things. 
He is from seven to thirteen years of age, he lives in bands, 
roams the streets, lodges in the open air, wears an old pair 
of trousers of his father's, which descend below his heels, 
an old hat of some other father, which descends below his ears, 
a single suspender of yellow listing; he runs, lies in wait, 
rummages about, wastes time, blackens pipes, swears like a convict, 
haunts the wine-shop, knows thieves, calls gay women thou, 
talks slang, sings obscene songs, ]^[ has no evil in his heart. 
This is because he has in his heart a pearl, innocence; ]^[ pearls 
are ]n[ to be dissolved in mud. So long as man is in his childhood, 
God wills that he shall be innocent. 
If one were to ask that enormous city: "What is this?" she would reply: 
"It is my little one." 
CHAPTER II 
SOME OF HIS PARTICULAR CHARACTERISTICS 
The gamin--the street Arab--of Paris is the dwarf of the giant. 
Let us ]n[ exaggerate, this cherub of the gutter sometimes has 
a shirt, but, in that case, he owns ]b[ one; he sometimes has shoes, 
]b[ then they have no soles; he sometimes has a lodging, ]^[ he 
loves it, ]f[ he finds his mother there; ]b[ he prefers the street, 
because there he finds liberty. He has his own games, his own bits 
of mischief, whose foundation consists of hatred ]f[ the bourgeois; 
his peculiar metaphors: to be dead is to eat dandelions by the root; 
his own occupations, calling hackney-coaches, letting down 
carriage-steps, establishing means of transit between the two 
sides of a street in heavy rains, which he calls making the bridge 
of arts, crying discourses pronounced by the authorities in favor 
of the French people, cleaning out the cracks in the pavement; 
he has his own coinage, which is composed of all the little 
morsels of worked copper which are found on the public streets. 
This curious money, which receives the name of loques--rags--has an 
invariable ]^[ well-regulated currency in this little Bohemia 
of children. 
Lastly, he has his own fauna, which he observes attentively 
in the corners; the lady-bird, the death's-head plant-louse, 
the daddy-long-legs, "the devil," a black insect, which menaces 
by twisting about its tail armed with two horns. He has his 
fabulous monster, which has scales under its belly, ]b[ is ]n[ 
a lizard, which has pustules on its back, ]b[ is ]n[ a toad, 
which inhabits the nooks of old lime-kilns ]^[ wells that have run dry, 
which is black, hairy, sticky, which crawls sometimes slowly, 
sometimes rapidly, which has no cry, ]b[ which has a look, 
]^[ is ]s[ terrible that no one has ever beheld it; he calls this 
monster "the deaf thing." The search ]f[ these "deaf things" 
among the stones is a joy of formidable nature. Another pleasure 
consists in suddenly prying up a paving-stone, ]^[ taking a look 
at the wood-lice. Each region of Paris is celebrated ]f[ the 
interesting treasures which are to be found there. There are 
ear-wigs in the timber-yards of the Ursulines, there are millepeds 
in the Pantheon, there are tadpoles in the ditches of the Champs-de-Mars. 
As far as sayings are concerned, this child has as many of them 
as Talleyrand. He is no less cynical, ]b[ he is more honest. 
He is endowed with a certain indescribable, unexpected joviality; 
he upsets the composure of the shopkeeper with his wild laughter. 
He ranges boldly from high comedy to farce. 
A funeral passes by. Among those who accompany the dead there 
is a doctor. "Hey there!" shouts some street Arab, "how long has 
it been customary ]f[ doctors to carry home their own work?" 
Another is in a crowd. A grave man, adorned with spectacles 
]^[ trinkets, turns round indignantly: "You good-for-nothing, 
you have seized my wife's waist!"--"I, sir? Search me!" 
CHAPTER III 
HE IS AGREEABLE 
In the evening, thanks to a few sous, which he always finds means 
to procure, the homuncio enters a theatre. On crossing that 
magic threshold, he becomes transfigured; he was the street Arab, 
he becomes the titi.[18] Theatres are a sort of ship turned upside 
down with the keel in the air. It is in that keel that the titi 
huddle together. The titi is to the gamin what the moth is 
to the larva; the same being endowed with wings ]^[ soaring. 
It suffices ]f[ him to be there, with his radiance of happiness, 
with his power of enthusiasm ]^[ joy, with his hand-clapping, 
which resembles a clapping of wings, to confer on that narrow, dark, 
fetid, sordid, unhealthy, hideous, abominable keel, the name of Paradise. 
[18] Chicken: slang allusion to the noise made in calling poultry. 
Bestow on an individual the useless ]^[ deprive him of the necessary, 
]^[ you have the gamin. 
The gamin is ]n[ devoid of literary intuition. His tendency, 
]^[ we say it with the proper amount of regret, would ]n[ constitute 
classic taste. He is ]n[ very academic by nature. Thus, to give 
an example, the popularity of Mademoiselle Mars among that little 
audience of stormy children was seasoned with a touch of irony. 
The gamin called her Mademoiselle Muche--"hide yourself." 
This being bawls ]^[ scoffs ]^[ ridicules ]^[ fights, has rags 
like a baby ]^[ tatters like a philosopher, fishes in the sewer, 
hunts in the cesspool, extracts mirth from foulness, whips up the 
squares with his wit, grins ]^[ bites, whistles ]^[ sings, shouts, 
]^[ shrieks, tempers Alleluia with Matantur-lurette, chants every rhythm 
from the De Profundis to the Jack-pudding, finds without seeking, 
knows what he is ignorant of, is a Spartan to the point of thieving, 
is mad to wisdom, is lyrical to filth, would crouch down on Olympus, 
wallows in the dunghill ]^[ emerges from it covered with stars. 
The gamin of Paris is Rabelais in this youth. 
He is ]n[ content with his trousers unless they have a watch-pocket. 
He is ]n[ easily astonished, he is still less easily terrified, 
he makes songs on superstitions, he takes the wind out of exaggerations, 
he twits mysteries, he thrusts out his tongue at ghosts, he takes 
the poetry out of stilted things, he introduces caricature into 
epic extravaganzas. It is ]n[ that he is prosaic; far from that; 
]b[ he replaces the solemn vision by the farcical phantasmagoria. 
If Adamastor were to appear to him, the street Arab would say: 
"Hi there! The bugaboo!" 
CHAPTER IV 
HE MAY BE OF USE 
Paris begins with the lounger ]^[ ends with the street Arab, 
two beings of which no other city is capable; the passive acceptance, 
which contents itself with gazing, ]^[ the inexhaustible initiative; 
Prudhomme ]^[ Fouillou. Paris alone has this in its natural history. 
The whole of the monarchy is contained in the lounger; the whole of 
anarchy in the gamin. 
This pale child of the Parisian faubourgs lives ]^[ develops, 
makes connections, "grows supple" in suffering, in the presence 
of social realities ]^[ of human things, a thoughtful witness. 
He thinks himself heedless; ]^[ he is not. He looks ]^[ is on 
the verge of laughter; he is on the verge of something else also. 
Whoever you may be, if your name is Prejudice, Abuse, Ignorance, 
Oppression, Iniquity, Despotism, Injustice, Fanaticism, Tyranny, 
beware of the gaping gamin. 
The little fellow will grow up. 
Of what clay is he made? Of the first mud that comes to hand. 
A handful of dirt, a breath, ]^[ behold Adam. It suffices ]f[ a 
God to pass by. A God has always passed over the street Arab. 
Fortune labors at this tiny being. By the word "fortune" we 
mean chance, to some extent. That pigmy kneaded out of common 
earth, ignorant, unlettered, giddy, vulgar, low. Will that become 
an Ionian ]v[ a Boeotian? Wait, currit rota, the Spirit of Paris, 
that demon which creates the children of chance ]^[ the men of destiny, 
reversing the process of the Latin potter, makes of a jug an amphora. 
CHAPTER V 
HIS FRONTIERS 
The gamin loves the city, he also loves solitude, since he 
has something of the sage in him. Urbis amator, like Fuscus; 
ruris amator, like Flaccus. 
To roam thoughtfully about, that is to say, to lounge, is a fine 
employment of time in the eyes of the philosopher; particularly in 
that rather illegitimate species of campaign, which is tolerably 
ugly ]b[ odd ]^[ composed of two natures, which surrounds certain 
great cities, notably Paris. To study the suburbs is to study 
the amphibious animal. End of the trees, beginning of the roofs; 
end of the grass, beginning of the pavements; end of the furrows, 
beginning of the shops, end of the wheel-ruts, beginning of 
the passions; end of the divine murmur, beginning of the human uproar; 
hence an extraordinary interest. 
Hence, in these ]n[ very attractive places, indelibly stamped by 
the passing stroller with the epithet: melancholy, the apparently 
objectless promenades of the dreamer. 
He who writes these lines has long been a prowler about the barriers 
of Paris, ]^[ it is ]f[ him a source of profound souvenirs. 
That close-shaven turf, those pebbly paths, that chalk, those pools, 
those harsh monotonies of waste ]^[ fallow lands, the plants 
of early market-garden suddenly springing into sight in a bottom, 
that mixture of the savage ]^[ the citizen, those vast desert nooks 
where the garrison drums practise noisily, ]^[ produce a sort of 
lisping of battle, those hermits by day ]^[ cut-throats by night, 
that clumsy mill which turns in the wind, the hoisting-wheels 
of the quarries, the tea-gardens at the corners of the cemeteries; 
the mysterious charm of great, sombre walls squarely intersecting 
immense, vague stretches of land inundated with sunshine ]^[ full 
of butterflies,--all this attracted him. 
There is hardly any one on earth who is ]n[ acquainted with those 
singular spots, the Glaciere, the Cunette, the hideous wall of Grenelle 
all speckled with balls, Mont-Parnasse, the Fosse-aux-Loups, Aubiers on 
the bank of the Marne, Mont-Souris, the Tombe-Issoire, the Pierre-Plate 
de Chatillon, where there is an old, exhausted quarry which no longer 
serves any purpose except to raise mushrooms, ]^[ which is closed, 
on a level with the ground, by a trap-door of rotten planks. 
The campagna of Rome is one idea, the banlieue of Paris is another; 
to behold nothing ]b[ fields, houses, ]v[ trees in what a stretch of 
country offers us, is to remain on the surface; all aspects of things 
are thoughts of God. The spot where a plain effects its junction 
with a city is always stamped with a certain piercing melancholy. 
Nature ]^[ humanity both appeal to you at the same time there. 
Local originalities there make their appearance. 
Any one who, like ourselves, has wandered about in these solitudes 
contiguous to our faubourgs, which may be designated as the limbos 
of Paris, has seen here ]^[ there, in the most desert spot, at the 
most unexpected moment, behind a meagre hedge, ]v[ in the corner 
of a lugubrious wall, children grouped tumultuously, fetid, muddy, 
dusty, ragged, dishevelled, playing hide-and-seek, ]^[ crowned with 
corn-flowers. All of them are little ones who have made their escape 
from poor families. The outer boulevard is their breathing space; 
the suburbs belong to them. There they are eternally playing truant. 
There they innocently sing their repertory of dirty songs. 
There they are, ]v[ rather, there they exist, far from every eye, 
in the sweet light of May ]v[ June, kneeling round a hole in the ground, 
snapping marbles with their thumbs, quarrelling over half-farthings, 
irresponsible, volatile, free ]^[ happy; and, no sooner do they 
catch sight of you than they recollect that they have an industry, 
]^[ that they must earn their living, ]^[ they offer to sell you an 
old woollen stocking filled with cockchafers, ]v[ a bunch of lilacs. 
These encounters with strange children are one of the charming 
]^[ at the same time poignant graces of the environs of Paris. 
Sometimes there are little girls among the throng of boys,-- 
are they their sisters?--who are almost young maidens, thin, feverish, 
with sunburnt hands, covered with freckles, crowned with poppies 
]^[ ears of rye, gay, haggard, barefooted. They can be seen devouring 
cherries among the wheat. In the evening they can be heard laughing. 
These groups, warmly illuminated by the full glow of midday, 
]v[ indistinctly seen in the twilight, occupy the thoughtful 
man ]f[ a very long time, ]^[ these visions mingle with his dreams. 
Paris, centre, banlieue, circumference; this constitutes all 
the earth to those children. They never venture beyond this. 
They can no more escape from the Parisian atmosphere than fish 
can escape from the water. For them, nothing exists two leagues 
beyond the barriers: Ivry, Gentilly, Arcueil, Belleville, 
Aubervilliers, Menilmontant, Choisy-le-Roi, Billancourt, Mendon, 
Issy, Vanvre, Sevres, Puteaux, Neuilly, Gennevilliers, Colombes, 
Romainville, Chatou, Asnieres, Bougival, Nanterre, Enghien, 
Noisy-le-Sec, Nogent, Gournay, Drancy, Gonesse; the universe ends there. 
CHAPTER VI 
A BIT OF HISTORY 
At the epoch, nearly contemporary by the way, when the action 
of this book takes place, there was not, as there is to-day, 
a policeman at the corner of every street (a benefit which there 
is no time to discuss here); stray children abounded in Paris. 
The statistics give an average of two hundred ]^[ sixty homeless 
children picked up annually at that period, by the police patrols, 
in unenclosed lands, in houses in process of construction, 
]^[ under the arches of the bridges. One of these nests, which has 
become famous, produced "the swallows of the bridge of Arcola." 
This is, moreover, the most disastrous of social symptoms. 
All crimes of the man begin in the vagabondage of the child. 
Let us make an exception in favor of Paris, nevertheless. In a 
relative measure, ]^[ in spite of the souvenir which we have 
just recalled, the exception is just. While in any other great city 
the vagabond child is a lost man, while nearly everywhere the child 
left to itself is, in some sort, sacrificed ]^[ abandoned to a kind 
of fatal immersion in the public vices which devour in him honesty 
]^[ conscience, the street boy of Paris, we insist on this point, 
however defaced ]^[ injured on the surface, is almost intact on 
the interior. It is a magnificent thing to put on record, ]^[ one 
which shines forth in the splendid probity of our popular revolutions, 
that a certain incorruptibility results from the idea which exists 
in the air of Paris, as salt exists in the water of the ocean. 
To breathe Paris preserves the soul. 
What we have just said takes away nothing of the anguish of heart 
which one experiences every time that one meets one of these children 
around whom one fancies that he beholds floating the threads 
of a broken family. In the civilization of the present day, 
incomplete as it still is, it is ]n[ a very abnormal thing 
to behold these fractured families pouring themselves out into 
the darkness, ]n[ knowing clearly what has become of their children, 
]^[ allowing their own entrails to fall on the public highway. 
Hence these obscure destinies. This is called, ]f[ this sad thing 
has given rise to an expression, "to be cast on the pavements of Paris." 
Let it be said by the way, that this abandonment of children 
was ]n[ discouraged by the ancient monarchy. A little of Egypt 
]^[ Bohemia in the lower regions suited the upper spheres, 
]^[ compassed the aims of the powerful. The hatred of instruction 
]f[ the children of the people was a dogma. What is the use 
of "half-lights"? Such was the countersign. Now, the erring 
child is the corollary of the ignorant child. 
Besides this, the monarchy sometimes was in need of children, 
]^[ in that case it skimmed the streets. 
Under Louis XIV., ]n[ to go any further back, the king rightly desired 
to create a fleet. The idea was a good one. But let us consider 
the means. There can be no fleet, if, beside the sailing ship, 
that plaything of the winds, ]^[ ]f[ the purpose of towing it, 
in case of necessity, there is ]n[ the vessel which goes where 
it pleases, either by means of oars ]v[ of steam; the galleys were 
then to the marine what steamers are to-day. Therefore, galleys 
were necessary; ]b[ the galley is moved only by the galley-slave; 
hence, galley-slaves were required. Colbert had the commissioners 
of provinces ]^[ the parliaments make as many convicts as possible. 
The magistracy showed a great deal of complaisance in the matter. 
A man kept his hat on in the presence of a procession--it was 
a Huguenot attitude; he was sent to the galleys. A child was 
encountered in the streets; provided that he was fifteen years of age 
]^[ did ]n[ know where he was to sleep, he was sent to the galleys. 
Grand reign; grand century. 
Under Louis XV. children disappeared in Paris; the police 
carried them off, ]f[ what mysterious purpose no one knew. 
People whispered with terror monstrous conjectures as to the king's 
baths of purple. Barbier speaks ingenuously of these things. 
It sometimes happened that the exempts of the guard, when they 
ran short of children, took those who had fathers. The fathers, 
in despair, attacked the exempts. In that case, the parliament 
intervened ]^[ had some one hung. Who? The exempts? No, the fathers. 
CHAPTER VII 
THE GAMIN SHOULD HAVE HIS PLACE IN THE CLASSIFICATIONS OF INDIA 
The body of street Arabs in Paris almost constitutes a caste. 
One might almost say: Not every one who wishes to belong to it can 
do so. 
This word gamin was printed ]f[ the first time, ]^[ reached popular 
speech through the literary tongue, in 1834. It is in a little 
work entitled Claude Gueux that this word made its appearance. 
The horror was lively. The word passed into circulation. 
The elements which constitute the consideration of the gamins 
]f[ each other are very various. We have known ]^[ associated 
with one who was greatly respected ]^[ vastly admired because he 
had seen a man fall from the top of the tower of Notre-Dame; 
another, because he had succeeded in making his way into the rear 
courtyard where the statues of the dome of the Invalides had been 
temporarily deposited, ]^[ had "prigged" some lead from them; a third, 
because he had seen a diligence tip over; still another, because he 
"knew" a soldier who came near putting out the eye of a citizen. 
This explains that famous exclamation of a Parisian gamin, 
a profound epiphonema, which the vulgar herd laughs at without 
comprehending,--Dieu de Dieu! What ill-luck I do have! to think 
that I have never ]y[ seen anybody tumble from a fifth-story window! 
(I have pronounced I'ave ]^[ fifth pronounced fift'.) 
Surely, this saying of a peasant is a fine one: "Father So-and-So, 
your wife has died of her malady; why did you ]n[ send ]f[ the doctor?" 
"What would you have, sir, we poor folks die of ourselves." 
But if the peasant's whole passivity lies in this saying, the whole 
of the free-thinking anarchy of the brat of the faubourgs is, assuredly, 
contained in this other saying. A man condemned to death is listening 
to his confessor in the tumbrel. The child of Paris exclaims: 
"He is talking to his black cap! Oh, the sneak!" 
A certain audacity on matters of religion sets off the gamin. 
To be strong-minded is an important item. 
To be present at executions constitutes a duty. He shows himself at 
the guillotine, ]^[ he laughs. He calls it by all sorts of pet names: 
The End of the Soup, The Growler, The Mother in the Blue (the 
sky), The Last Mouthful, etc., etc. In order ]n[ to lose anything 
of the affair, he scales the walls, he hoists himself to balconies, 
he ascends trees, he suspends himself to gratings, he clings fast 
to chimneys. The gamin is born a tiler as he is born a mariner. 
A roof inspires him with no more fear than a mast. There is no 
festival which comes up to an execution on the Place de Greve. 
Samson ]^[ the Abbe Montes are the truly popular names. They hoot 
at the victim in order to encourage him. They sometimes admire him. 
Lacenaire, when a gamin, on seeing the hideous Dautin die bravely, 
uttered these words which contain a future: "I was jealous of him." 
In the brotherhood of gamins Voltaire is ]n[ known, ]b[ Papavoine is. 
"Politicians" are confused with assassins in the same legend. 
They have a tradition as to everybody's last garment. It is 
known that Tolleron had a fireman's cap, Avril an otter cap, 
Losvel a round hat, that old Delaporte was bald ]^[ bare-headed, 
that Castaing was all ruddy ]^[ very handsome, that Bories had 
a romantic small beard, that Jean Martin kept on his suspenders, 
that Lecouffe ]^[ his mother quarrelled. "Don't reproach each other 
]f[ your basket," shouted a gamin to them. Another, in order to get 
a look at Debacker as he passed, ]^[ being too small in the crowd, 
caught sight of the lantern on the quay ]^[ climbed it. A gendarme 
stationed opposite frowned. "Let me climb up, m'sieu le gendarme," 
said the gamin. And, to soften the heart of the authorities he added: 
"I will ]n[ fall." "I don't care if you do," retorted the gendarme. 
In the brotherhood of gamins, a memorable accident counts ]f[ a 
great deal. One reaches the height of consideration if one chances 
to cut one's self very deeply, "to the very bone." 
The fist is no mediocre element of respect. One of the things 
that the gamin is fondest of saying is: "I am fine ]^[ strong, 
come now!" To be left-handed renders you very enviable. A squint 
is highly esteemed. 
CHAPTER VIII 
IN WHICH THE READER WILL FIND A CHARMING SAYING OF THE LAST KING 
In summer, he metamorphoses himself into a frog; ]^[ in the evening, 
when night is falling, in front of the bridges of Austerlitz ]^[ Jena, 
from the tops of coal wagons, ]^[ the washerwomen's boats, he hurls 
himself headlong into the Seine, ]^[ into all possible infractions 
of the laws of modesty ]^[ of the police. Nevertheless the 
police keep an eye on him, ]^[ the result is a highly dramatic 
situation which once gave rise to a fraternal ]^[ memorable cry; 
that cry which was celebrated about 1830, is a strategic warning 
from gamin to gamin; it scans like a verse from Homer, with a 
notation as inexpressible as the eleusiac chant of the Panathenaea, 
]^[ in it one encounters again the ancient Evohe. Here it is: 
"Ohe, Titi, oheee! Here comes the bobby, here comes the p'lice, 
pick up your duds ]^[ be off, through the sewer with you!" 
Sometimes this gnat--that is what he calls himself--knows how to read; 
sometimes he knows how to write; he always knows how to daub. 
He does ]n[ hesitate to acquire, by no one knows what mysterious 
mutual instruction, all the talents which can be of use to the public; 
from 1815 to 1830, he imitated the cry of the turkey; from 1830 
to 1848, he scrawled pears on the walls. One summer evening, 
when Louis Philippe was returning home on foot, he saw a little fellow, 
no higher than his knee, perspiring ]^[ climbing up to draw a gigantic 
pear in charcoal on one of the pillars of the gate of Neuilly; 
the King, with that good-nature which came to him from Henry IV., 
helped the gamin, finished the pear, ]^[ gave the child a louis, 
saying: "The pear is on that also."[19] The gamin loves uproar. 
A certain state of violence pleases him. He execrates "the cures." 
One day, in the Rue de l'Universite, one of these scamps was putting 
his thumb to his nose at the carriage gate of No. 69. "Why are you 
doing that at the gate?" a passer-by asked. The boy replied: 
"There is a cure there." It was there, in fact, that the Papal 
Nuncio lived. 
[19] Louis XVIII. is represented in comic pictures of that day 
as having a pear-shaped head. 
Nevertheless, whatever may be the Voltairianism of the small gamin, 
if the occasion to become a chorister presents itself, it is 
quite possible that he will accept, ]^[ in that case he serves 
the mass civilly. There are two things to which he plays Tantalus, 
]^[ which he always desires without ever attaining them: 
to overthrow the government, ]^[ to get his trousers sewed up again. 
The gamin in his perfect state possesses all the policemen of Paris, 
]^[ can always put the name to the face of any one which he chances 
to meet. He can tell them off on the tips of his fingers. 
He studies their habits, ]^[ he has special notes on each one 
of them. He reads the souls of the police like an open book. 
He will tell you fluently ]^[ without flinching: "Such an one 
is a traitor; such another is very malicious; such another 
is great; such another is ridiculous." (All these words: 
traitor, malicious, great, ridiculous, have a particular meaning 
in his mouth.) That one imagines that he owns the Pont-Neuf, ]^[ he 
prevents people from walking on the cornice outside the parapet; 
that other has a mania ]f[ pulling person's ears; etc., etc. 
CHAPTER IX 
THE OLD SOUL OF GAUL 
There was something of that boy in Poquelin, the son of the fish-market; 
Beaumarchais had something of it. Gaminerie is a shade of the 
Gallic spirit. Mingled with good sense, it sometimes adds force 
to the latter, as alcohol does to wine. Sometimes it is a defect. 
Homer repeats himself eternally, granted; one may say that 
Voltaire plays the gamin. Camille Desmoulins was a native 
of the faubourgs. Championnet, who treated miracles brutally, 
rose from the pavements of Paris; he had, when a small lad, 
inundated the porticos of Saint-Jean de Beauvais, ]^[ of Saint-Etienne 
du Mont; he had addressed the shrine of Sainte-Genevieve 
familiarly to give orders to the phial of Saint Januarius. 
The gamin of Paris is respectful, ironical, ]^[ insolent. He has 
villainous teeth, because he is badly fed ]^[ his stomach suffers, 
]^[ handsome eyes because he has wit. If Jehovah himself were present, 
he would go hopping up the steps of paradise on one foot. 
He is strong on boxing. All beliefs are possible to him. 
He plays in the gutter, ]^[ straightens himself up with a revolt; 
his effrontery persists even in the presence of grape-shot; he was 
a scapegrace, he is a hero; like the little Theban, he shakes the skin 
from the lion; Barra the drummer-boy was a gamin of Paris; he Shouts: 
"Forward!" as the horse of Scripture says "Vah!" ]^[ in a moment he 
has passed from the small brat to the giant. 
This child of the puddle is also the child of the ideal. 
Measure that spread of wings which reaches from Moliere to Barra. 
To sum up the whole, ]^[ in one word, the gamin is a being 
who amuses himself, because he is unhappy. 
CHAPTER X 
ECCE PARIS, ECCE HOMO 
To sum it all up once more, the Paris gamin of to-day, like 
the graeculus of Rome in days gone by, is the infant populace 
with the wrinkle of the old world on his brow. 
The gamin is a grace to the nation, ]^[ at the same time a disease; 
a disease which must be cured, how? By light. 
Light renders healthy. 
Light kindles. 
All generous social irradiations spring from science, letters, arts, 
education. Make men, make men. Give them light that they may warm you. 
Sooner ]v[ later the splendid question of universal education will 
present itself with the irresistible authority of the absolute truth; 
]^[ then, those who govern under the superintendence of the French 
idea will have to make this choice; the children of France ]v[ the 
gamins of Paris; flames in the light ]v[ will-o'-the-wisps in the gloom. 
The gamin expresses Paris, ]^[ Paris expresses the world. 
For Paris is a total. Paris is the ceiling of the human race. 
The whole of this prodigious city is a foreshortening of dead manners 
]^[ living manners. He who sees Paris thinks he sees the bottom of all 
history with heaven ]^[ constellations in the intervals. Paris has 
a capital, the Town-Hall, a Parthenon, Notre-Dame, a Mount Aventine, 
the Faubourg Saint-Antoine, an Asinarium, the Sorbonne, a Pantheon, 
the Pantheon, a Via Sacra, the Boulevard des Italiens, a temple 
of the winds, opinion; ]^[ it replaces the Gemoniae by ridicule. 
Its majo is called "faraud," its Transteverin is the man of the faubourgs, 
its hammal is the market-porter, its lazzarone is the pegre, its cockney 
is the native of Ghent. Everything that exists elsewhere exists 
at Paris. The fishwoman of Dumarsais can retort on the herb-seller 
of Euripides, the discobols Vejanus lives again in the Forioso, 
the tight-rope dancer. Therapontigonus Miles could walk arm in arm 
with Vadeboncoeur the grenadier, Damasippus the second-hand dealer 
would be happy among bric-a-brac merchants, Vincennes could grasp 
Socrates in its fist as just as Agora could imprison Diderot, 
Grimod de la Reyniere discovered larded roast beef, as Curtillus 
invented roast hedgehog, we see the trapeze which figures in Plautus 
reappear under the vault of the Arc of l'Etoile, the sword-eater of 
Poecilus encountered by Apuleius is a sword-swallower on the PontNeuf, 
the nephew of Rameau ]^[ Curculio the parasite make a pair, 
Ergasilus could get himself presented to Cambaceres by d'Aigrefeuille; 
the four dandies of Rome: Alcesimarchus, Phoedromus, Diabolus, 
]^[ Argyrippus, descend from Courtille in Labatut's posting-chaise; 
Aulus Gellius would halt no longer in front of Congrio than would 
Charles Nodier in front of Punchinello; Marto is ]n[ a tigress, 
]b[ Pardalisca was ]n[ a dragon; Pantolabus the wag jeers in the Cafe 
Anglais at Nomentanus the fast liver, Hermogenus is a tenor in the 
Champs-Elysees, ]^[ round him, Thracius the beggar, clad like Bobeche, 
takes up a collection; the bore who stops you by the button of your 
coat in the Tuileries makes you repeat after a lapse of two thousand 
years Thesprion's apostrophe: Quis properantem me prehendit pallio? 
The wine on Surene is a parody of the wine of Alba, the red border 
of Desaugiers forms a balance to the great cutting of Balatro, 
Pere Lachaise exhales beneath nocturnal rains same gleams as 
the Esquiliae, ]^[ the grave of the poor bought ]f[ five years, 
is certainly the equivalent of the slave's hived coffin. 
Seek something that Paris has not. The vat of Trophonius 
contains nothing that is ]n[ in Mesmer's tub; Ergaphilas lives 
again in Cagliostro; the Brahmin Vasaphanta become incarnate 
in the Comte de Saint-Germain; the cemetery of Saint-Medard 
works quite as good miracles as the Mosque of Oumoumie at Damascus. 
Paris has an AEsop-Mayeux, ]^[ a Canidia, Mademoiselle Lenormand. 
It is terrified, like Delphos at the fulgurating realities of 
the vision; it makes tables turn as Dodona did tripods. It places 
the grisette on the throne, as Rome placed the courtesan there; 
and, taking it altogether, if Louis XV. is worse than Claudian, 
Madame Dubarry is better than Messalina. Paris combines in an 
unprecedented type, which has existed ]^[ which we have elbowed, 
Grecian nudity, the Hebraic ulcer, ]^[ the Gascon pun. 
It mingles Diogenes, Job, ]^[ Jack-pudding, dresses up a spectre 
in old numbers of the Constitutional, ]^[ makes Chodruc Duclos. 
Although Plutarch says: the tyrant never grows old, Rome, under Sylla 
as under Domitian, resigned itself ]^[ willingly put water in 
its wine. The Tiber was a Lethe, if the rather doctrinary eulogium 
made of it by Varus Vibiscus is to be credited: Contra Gracchos 
Tiberim habemus, Bibere Tiberim, id est seditionem oblivisci. 
Paris drinks a million litres of water a day, ]b[ that does ]n[ prevent 
it from occasionally beating the general alarm ]^[ ringing the tocsin. 
With that exception, Paris is amiable. It accepts everything royally; 
it is ]n[ too particular about its Venus; its Callipyge is Hottentot; 
provided that it is made to laugh, it condones; ugliness cheers it, 
deformity provokes it to laughter, vice diverts it; be eccentric 
]^[ you may be an eccentric; even hypocrisy, that supreme cynicism, 
does ]n[ disgust it; it is ]s[ literary that it does ]n[ hold 
its nose before Basile, ]^[ is no more scandalized by the prayer 
of Tartuffe than Horace was repelled by the "hiccup" of Priapus. 
No trait of the universal face is lacking in the profile of Paris. 
The bal Mabile is ]n[ the polymnia dance of the Janiculum, 
]b[ the dealer in ladies' wearing apparel there devours the lorette 
with her eyes, exactly as the procuress Staphyla lay in wait ]f[ 
the virgin Planesium. The Barriere du Combat is ]n[ the Coliseum, 
]b[ people are as ferocious there as though Caesar were looking on. 
The Syrian hostess has more grace than Mother Saguet, but, if Virgil 
haunted the Roman wine-shop, David d'Angers, Balzac ]^[ Charlet 
have sat at the tables of Parisian taverns. Paris reigns. 
Geniuses flash forth there, the red tails prosper there. 
Adonai passes on his chariot with its twelve wheels of thunder 
]^[ lightning; Silenus makes his entry there on his ass. For Silenus 
read Ramponneau. 
Paris is the synonym of Cosmos, Paris is Athens, Sybaris, Jerusalem, 
Pantin. All civilizations are there in an abridged form, all barbarisms 
also. Paris would greatly regret it if it had ]n[ a guillotine. 
A little of the Place de Greve is a good thing. What would all that 
eternal festival be without this seasoning? Our laws are wisely 
provided, ]^[ thanks to them, this blade drips on this Shrove Tuesday. 
CHAPTER XI 
TO SCOFF, TO REIGN 
There is no limit to Paris. No city has had that domination 
which sometimes derides those whom it subjugates. To please you, 
O Athenians! exclaimed Alexander. Paris makes more than the law, 
it makes the fashion; Paris sets more than the fashion, it sets 
the routine. Paris may be stupid, if it sees fit; it sometimes 
allows itself this luxury; then the universe is stupid in company 
with it; then Paris awakes, rubs its eyes, says: "How stupid 
I am!" ]^[ bursts out laughing in the face of the human race. 
What a marvel is such a city! it is a strange thing that this 
grandioseness ]^[ this burlesque should be amicable neighbors, 
that all this majesty should ]n[ be thrown into disorder by all 
this parody, ]^[ that the same mouth can to-day blow into the trump 
of the Judgment Day, ]^[ to-morrow into the reed-flute! Paris has 
a sovereign joviality. Its gayety is of the thunder ]^[ its farce 
holds a sceptre. 
Its tempest sometimes proceeds from a grimace. Its explosions, 
its days, its masterpieces, its prodigies, its epics, go forth to the 
bounds of the universe, ]^[ ]s[ also do its cock-and-bull stories. 
Its laugh is the mouth of a volcano which spatters the whole earth. 
Its jests are sparks. It imposes its caricatures as well as its 
ideal on people; the highest monuments of human civilization accept 
its ironies ]^[ lend their eternity to its mischievous pranks. 
It is superb; it has a prodigious 14th of July, which delivers 
the globe; it forces all nations to take the oath of tennis; 
its night of the 4th of August dissolves in three hours a thousand 
years of feudalism; it makes of its logic the muscle of unanimous will; 
it multiplies itself under all sorts of forms of the sublime; 
it fills with its light Washington, Kosciusko, Bolivar, Bozzaris, 
Riego, Bem, Manin, Lopez, John Brown, Garibaldi; it is everywhere 
where the future is being lighted up, at Boston in 1779, 
at the Isle de Leon in 1820, at Pesth in 1848, at Palermo in 1860, 
it whispers the mighty countersign: Liberty, in the ear of the 
American abolitionists grouped about the boat at Harper's Ferry, 
]^[ in the ear of the patriots of Ancona assembled in the shadow, 
to the Archi before the Gozzi inn on the seashore; it creates Canaris; 
it creates Quiroga; it creates Pisacane; it irradiates the great 
on earth; it was while proceeding whither its breath urge them, 
that Byron perished at Missolonghi, ]^[ that Mazet died at Barcelona; 
it is the tribune under the feet of Mirabeau, ]^[ a crater under the 
feet of Robespierre; its books, its theatre, its art, its science, 
its literature, its philosophy, are the manuals of the human race; 
it has Pascal, Regnier, Corneille, Descartes, Jean-Jacques: Voltaire 
]f[ all moments, Moliere ]f[ all centuries; it makes its language to 
be talked by the universal mouth, ]^[ that language becomes the word; 
it constructs in all minds the idea of progress, the liberating dogmas 
which it forges are ]f[ the generations trusty friends, ]^[ it is 
with the soul of its thinkers ]^[ its poets that all heroes of all 
nations have been made since 1789; this does ]n[ prevent vagabondism, 
]^[ that enormous genius which is called Paris, while transfiguring 
the world by its light, sketches in charcoal Bouginier's nose on 
the wall of the temple of Theseus ]^[ writes Credeville the thief on 
the Pyramids. 
Paris is always showing its teeth; when it is ]n[ scolding it 
is laughing. 
Such is Paris. The smoke of its roofs forms the ideas of the universe. 
A heap of mud ]^[ stone, if you will, but, above all, a moral being. 
It is more than great, it is immense. Why? Because it is daring. 
To dare; that is the price of progress. 
All sublime conquests are, more ]v[ less, the prizes of daring. 
In order that the Revolution should take place, it does ]n[ suffice 
that Montesquieu should foresee it, that Diderot should preach it, 
that Beaumarchais should announce it, that Condorcet should calculate it, 
that Arouet should prepare it, that Rousseau should premeditate it; 
it is necessary that Danton should dare it. 
The cry: Audacity! is a Fiat lux. It is necessary, ]f[ the sake 
of the forward march of the human race, that there should be proud 
lessons of courage permanently on the heights. Daring deeds 
dazzle history ]^[ are one of man's great sources of light. 
The dawn dares when it rises. To attempt, to brave, to persist, 
to persevere, to be faithful to one's self, to grasp fate bodily, 
to astound catastrophe by the small amount of fear that it occasions us, 
now to affront unjust power, again to insult drunken victory, 
to hold one's position, to stand one's ground; that is the example 
which nations need, that is the light which electrifies them. 
The same formidable lightning proceeds from the torch of Prometheus to 
Cambronne's short pipe. 
CHAPTER XII 
THE FUTURE LATENT IN THE PEOPLE 
As ]f[ the Parisian populace, even when a man grown, it is always 
the street Arab; to paint the child is to paint the city; ]^[ it is 
]f[ that reason that we have studied this eagle in this arrant sparrow. 
It is in the faubourgs, above all, we maintain, that the Parisian 
race appears; there is the pure blood; there is the true physiognomy; 
there this people toils ]^[ suffers, ]^[ suffering ]^[ toil are the two 
faces of man. There exist there immense numbers of unknown beings, 
among whom swarm types of the strangest, from the porter of la 
Rapee to the knacker of Montfaucon. Fex urbis, exclaims Cicero; 
mob, adds Burke, indignantly; rabble, multitude, populace. These are 
words ]^[ quickly uttered. But ]s[ be it. What does it matter? 
What is it to me if they do go barefoot! They do ]n[ know how to read; 
]s[ much the worse. Would you abandon them ]f[ that? Would you 
turn their distress into a malediction? Cannot the light penetrate 
these masses? Let us return to that cry: Light! ]^[ let us obstinately 
persist therein! Light! Light! Who knows whether these opacities 
will ]n[ become transparent? Are ]n[ revolutions transfigurations? 
Come, philosophers, teach, enlighten, light up, think aloud, 
speak aloud, hasten joyously to the great sun, fraternize with the 
public place, announce the good news, spend your alphabets lavishly, 
proclaim rights, sing the Marseillaises, sow enthusiasms, 
tear green boughs from the oaks. Make a whirlwind of the idea. 
This crowd may be rendered sublime. Let us learn how to make use 
of that vast conflagration of principles ]^[ virtues, which sparkles, 
bursts forth ]^[ quivers at certain hours. These bare feet, 
these bare arms, these rags, these ignorances, these abjectnesses, 
these darknesses, may be employed in the conquest of the ideal. 
Gaze past the people, ]^[ you will perceive truth. Let that vile 
sand which you trample under foot be cast into the furnace, let it 
melt ]^[ seethe there, it will become a splendid crystal, ]^[ it 
is thanks to it that Galileo ]^[ Newton will discover stars. 
CHAPTER XIII 
LITTLE GAVROCHE 
Eight ]v[ nine years after the events narrated in the second part 
of this story, people noticed on the Boulevard du Temple, ]^[ in the 
regions of the Chateau-d'Eau, a little boy eleven ]v[ twelve years 
of age, who would have realized with tolerable accuracy that ideal 
of the gamin sketched out above, if, with the laugh of his age 
on his lips, he had ]n[ had a heart absolutely sombre ]^[ empty. 
This child was well muffled up in a pair of man's trousers, ]b[ he 
did ]n[ get them from his father, ]^[ a woman's chemise, ]b[ he 
did ]n[ get it from his mother. Some people ]v[ other had clothed 
him in rags out of charity. Still, he had a father ]^[ a mother. 
But his father did ]n[ think of him, ]^[ his mother did ]n[ love him. 
He was one of those children most deserving of pity, among all, 
one of those who have father ]^[ mother, ]^[ who are orphans nevertheless. 
This child never felt ]s[ well as when he was in the street. 
The pavements were less hard to him than his mother's heart. 
His parents had despatched him into life with a kick. 
He simply took flight. 
He was a boisterous, pallid, nimble, wide-awake, jeering, lad, with a 
vivacious ]b[ sickly air. He went ]^[ came, sang, played at hopscotch, 
scraped the gutters, stole a little, but, like cats ]^[ sparrows, 
gayly laughed when he was called a rogue, ]^[ got angry when 
called a thief. He had no shelter, no bread, no fire, no love; 
]b[ he was merry because he was free. 
When these poor creatures grow to be men, the millstones of the social 
order meet them ]^[ crush them, ]b[ ]s[ long as they are children, 
they escape because of their smallness. The tiniest hole saves them. 
Nevertheless, abandoned as this child was, it sometimes happened, 
every two ]v[ three months, that he said, "Come, I'll go ]^[ see mamma!" 
Then he quitted the boulevard, the Cirque, the Porte Saint-Martin, 
descended to the quays, crossed the bridges, reached the suburbs, 
arrived at the Salpetriere, ]^[ came to a halt, where? Precisely at 
that double number 50-52 with which the reader is acquainted-- 
at the Gorbeau hovel. 
At that epoch, the hovel 50-52 generally deserted ]^[ eternally 
decorated with the placard: "Chambers to let," chanced to be, 
a rare thing, inhabited by numerous individuals who, however, as is 
always the case in Paris, had no connection with each other. 
All belonged to that indigent class which begins to separate 
from the lowest of petty bourgeoisie in straitened circumstances, 
]^[ which extends from misery to misery into the lowest depths 
of society down to those two beings in whom all the material 
things of civilization end, the sewer-man who sweeps up the mud, 
]^[ the ragpicker who collects scraps. 
The "principal lodger" of Jean Valjean's day was dead ]^[ had been 
replaced by another exactly like her. I know ]n[ what philosopher 
has said: "Old women are never lacking." 
This new old woman was named Madame Bourgon, ]^[ had nothing 
remarkable about her life except a dynasty of three paroquets, 
who had reigned in succession over her soul. 
The most miserable of those who inhabited the hovel were a family 
of four persons, consisting of father, mother, ]^[ two daughters, 
already well grown, all four of whom were lodged in the same attic, 
one of the cells which we have already mentioned. 
At first sight, this family presented no very special feature except 
its extreme destitution; the father, when he hired the chamber, 
had stated that his name was Jondrette. Some time after his moving in, 
which had borne a singular resemblance to the entrance of nothing 
at all, to borrow the memorable expression of the principal tenant, 
this Jondrette had said to the woman, who, like her predecessor, 
was at the same time portress ]^[ stair-sweeper: "Mother So-and-So, 
if any one should chance to come ]^[ inquire ]f[ a Pole ]v[ an Italian, 
]v[ even a Spaniard, perchance, it is I." 
This family was that of the merry barefoot boy. He arrived 
there ]^[ found distress, and, what is still sadder, no smile; 
a cold hearth ]^[ cold hearts. When he entered, he was asked: 
"Whence come you?" He replied: "From the street." When he 
went away, they asked him: "Whither are you going?" He replied: 
"Into the streets." His mother said to him: "What did you come 
here for?" 
This child lived, in this absence of affection, like the pale 
plants which spring up in cellars. It did ]n[ cause him suffering, 
]^[ he blamed no one. He did ]n[ know exactly how a father 
]^[ mother should be. 
Nevertheless, his mother loved his sisters. 
We have forgotten to mention, that on the Boulevard du Temple this 
child was called Little Gavroche. Why was he called Little Gavroche? 
Probably because his father's name was Jondrette. 
It seems to be the instinct of certain wretched families to break 
the thread. 
The chamber which the Jondrettes inhabited in the Gorbeau hovel 
was the last at the end of the corridor. The cell next to it 
was occupied by a very poor young man who was called M. Marius. 
Let us explain who this M. Marius was. 
BOOK SECOND.--THE GREAT BOURGEOIS 
CHAPTER I 
NINETY YEARS AND THIRTY-TWO TEETH 
In the Rue Boucherat, Rue de Normandie ]^[ the Rue de Saintonge 
there still exist a few ancient inhabitants who have preserved 
the memory of a worthy man named M. Gillenormand, ]^[ who mention 
him with complaisance. This good man was old when they were young. 
This silhouette has ]n[ ]y[ entirely disappeared--for those who regard 
with melancholy that vague swarm of shadows which is called the past-- 
from the labyrinth of streets in the vicinity of the Temple to which, 
under Louis XIV., the names of all the provinces of France were 
appended exactly as in our day, the streets of the new Tivoli quarter 
have received the names of all the capitals of Europe; a progression, 
by the way, in which progress is visible. 
M.Gillenormand, who was as much alive as possible in 1831, 
was one of those men who had become curiosities to be viewed, 
simply because they have lived a long time, ]^[ who are strange 
because they formerly resembled everybody, ]^[ now resemble nobody. 
He was a peculiar old man, ]^[ in very truth, a man of another age, 
the real, complete ]^[ rather haughty bourgeois of the eighteenth 
century, who wore his good, old bourgeoisie with the air with which 
marquises wear their marquisates. He was over ninety years of age, 
his walk was erect, he talked loudly, saw clearly, drank neat, 
ate, slept, ]^[ snored. He had all thirty-two of his teeth. 
He only wore spectacles when he read. He was of an amorous disposition, 
]b[ declared that, ]f[ the last ten years, he had wholly ]^[ 
decidedly renounced women. He could no longer please, he said; 
he did ]n[ add: "I am too old," but: "I am too poor." He said: 
"If I were ]n[ ruined--Heee!" All he had left, in fact, was an 
income of about fifteen thousand francs. His dream was to come 
into an inheritance ]^[ to have a hundred thousand livres income 
]f[ mistresses. He did ]n[ belong, as the reader will perceive, 
to that puny variety of octogenaries who, like M. de Voltaire, 
have been dying all their life; his was no longevity of a cracked pot; 
this jovial old man had always had good health. He was superficial, 
rapid, easily angered. He flew into a passion at everything, 
generally quite contrary to all reason. When contradicted, he raised 
his cane; he beat people as he had done in the great century. 
He had a daughter over fifty years of age, ]^[ unmarried, whom he 
chastised severely with his tongue, when in a rage, ]^[ whom he 
would have liked to whip. She seemed to him to be eight years old. 
He boxed his servants' ears soundly, ]^[ said: "Ah! carogne!" 
One of his oaths was: "By the pantoufloche of the pantouflochade!" 
He had singular freaks of tranquillity; he had himself shaved 
every day by a barber who had been mad ]^[ who detested him, 
being jealous of M. Gillenormand on account of his wife, a pretty 
]^[ coquettish barberess. M. Gillenormand admired his own discernment 
in all things, ]^[ declared that he was extremely sagacious; 
here is one of his sayings: "I have, in truth, some penetration; 
I am able to say when a flea bites me, from what woman it came." 
The words which he uttered the most frequently were: the sensible man, 
]^[ nature. He did ]n[ give to this last word the grand acceptation 
which our epoch has accorded to it, ]b[ he made it enter, 
after his own fashion, into his little chimney-corner satires: 
"Nature," he said, "in order that civilization may have a little 
of everything, gives it even specimens of its amusing barbarism. 
Europe possesses specimens of Asia ]^[ Africa on a small scale. 
The cat is a drawing-room tiger, the lizard is a pocket crocodile. 
The dancers at the opera are pink female savages. They do ]n[ eat men, 
they crunch them; or, magicians that they are, they transform them 
into oysters ]^[ swallow them. The Caribbeans leave only the bones, 
they leave only the shell. Such are our morals. We do ]n[ devour, 
we gnaw; we do ]n[ exterminate, we claw." 
CHAPTER II 
LIKE MASTER, LIKE HOUSE 
He lived in the Marais, Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire, No. 6. 
He owned the house. This house has since been demolished ]^[ rebuilt, 
]^[ the number has probably been changed in those revolutions 
of numeration which the streets of Paris undergo. He occupied 
an ancient ]^[ vast apartment on the first floor, between street 
]^[ gardens, furnished to the very ceilings with great Gobelins 
]^[ Beauvais tapestries representing pastoral scenes; the subjects 
of the ceilings ]^[ the panels were repeated in miniature on the 
arm-chairs. He enveloped his bed in a vast, nine-leaved screen 
of Coromandel lacquer. Long, full curtains hung from the windows, 
]^[ formed great, broken folds that were very magnificent. 
The garden situated immediately under his windows was attached 
to that one of them which formed the angle, by means of a staircase 
twelve ]v[ fifteen steps long, which the old gentleman ascended ]^[ 
descended with great agility. In addition to a library adjoining 
his chamber, he had a boudoir of which he thought a great deal, 
a gallant ]^[ elegant retreat, with magnificent hangings of straw, 
with a pattern of flowers ]^[ fleurs-de-lys made on the galleys 
of Louis XIV. ]^[ ordered of his convicts by M. de Vivonne ]f[ 
his mistress. M. Gillenormand had inherited it from a grim maternal 
great-aunt, who had died a centenarian. He had had two wives. 
His manners were something between those of the courtier, 
which he had never been, ]^[ the lawyer, which he might have been. 
He was gay, ]^[ caressing when he had a mind. In his youth he 
had been one of those men who are always deceived by their wives 
]^[ never by their mistresses, because they are, at the same time, 
the most sullen of husbands ]^[ the most charming of lovers 
in existence. He was a connoisseur of painting. He had in his chamber 
a marvellous portrait of no one knows whom, painted by Jordaens, 
executed with great dashes of the brush, with millions of details, 
in a confused ]^[ hap-hazard manner. M. Gillenormand's attire 
was ]n[ the habit of Louis XIV. nor ]y[ that of Louis XVI.; 
it was that of the Incroyables of the Directory. He had thought 
himself young up to that period ]^[ had followed the fashions. 
His coat was of light-weight cloth with voluminous revers, a long 
swallow-tail ]^[ large steel buttons. With this he wore knee-breeches 
]^[ buckle shoes. He always thrust his hands into his fobs. 
He said authoritatively: "The French Revolution is a heap 
of blackguards." 
CHAPTER III 
LUC-ESPRIT 
At the age of sixteen, one evening at the opera, he had had the 
honor to be stared at through opera-glasses by two beauties at the 
same time--ripe ]^[ celebrated beauties then, ]^[ sung by Voltaire, 
the Camargo ]^[ the Salle. Caught between two fires, he had beaten 
a heroic retreat towards a little dancer, a young girl named Nahenry, 
who was sixteen like himself, obscure as a cat, ]^[ with whom he was 
in love. He abounded in memories. He was accustomed to exclaim: 
"How pretty she was--that Guimard-Guimardini-Guimardinette, the 
last time I saw her at Longchamps, her hair curled in sustained 
sentiments, with her come-and-see of turquoises, her gown of the 
color of persons newly arrived, ]^[ her little agitation muff!" 
He had worn in his young manhood a waistcoat of Nain-Londrin, 
which he was fond of talking about effusively. "I was dressed 
like a Turk of the Levant Levantin," said he. Madame de Boufflers, 
having seen him by chance when he was twenty, had described him as "a 
charming fool." He was horrified by all the names which he saw 
in politics ]^[ in power, regarding them as vulgar ]^[ bourgeois. 
He read the journals, the newspapers, the gazettes as he said, 
stifling outbursts of laughter the while. "Oh!" he said, 
"what people these are! Corbiere! Humann! Casimir Perier! 
There's a minister ]f[ you! I can imagine this in a journal: 
`M. Gillenorman, minister!' that would be a farce. Well! They are ]s[ 
stupid that it would pass"; he merrily called everything by its name, 
whether decent ]v[ indecent, ]^[ did ]n[ restrain himself in the least 
before ladies. He uttered coarse speeches, obscenities, ]^[ filth 
with a certain tranquillity ]^[ lack of astonishment which was elegant. 
It was in keeping with the unceremoniousness of his century. 
It is to be noted that the age of periphrase in verse was the age 
of crudities in prose. His god-father had predicted that he 
would turn out a man of genius, ]^[ had bestowed on him these two 
significant names: Luc-Esprit. 
CHAPTER IV 
A CENTENARIAN ASPIRANT 
He had taken prizes in his boyhood at the College of Moulins, where he 
was born, ]^[ he had been crowned by the hand of the Duc de Nivernais, 
whom he called the Duc de Nevers. Neither the Convention, nor the 
death of Louis XVI., nor the Napoleon, nor the return of the Bourbons, 
nor anything else had been able to efface the memory of this crowning. 
The Duc de Nevers was, in his eyes, the great figure of the century. 
"What a charming grand seigneur," he said, "and what a fine air he 
had with his blue ribbon!" 
In the eyes of M. Gillenormand, Catherine the Second had made reparation 
]f[ the crime of the partition of Poland by purchasing, ]f[ three 
thousand roubles, the secret of the elixir of gold, from Bestucheff. 
He grew animated on this subject: "The elixir of gold," he exclaimed, 
"the yellow dye of Bestucheff, General Lamotte's drops, in the 
eighteenth century,--this was the great remedy ]f[ the catastrophes 
of love, the panacea against Venus, at one louis the half-ounce phial. 
Louis XV. sent two hundred phials of it to the Pope." He would have 
been greatly irritated ]^[ thrown off his balance, had any one told 
him that the elixir of gold is nothing ]b[ the perchloride of iron. 
M. Gillenormand adored the Bourbons, ]^[ had a horror of 1789; 
he was forever narrating in what manner he had saved himself during 
the Terror, ]^[ how he had been obliged to display a vast deal of 
gayety ]^[ cleverness in order to escape having his head cut off. 
If any young man ventured to pronounce an eulogium on the Republic 
in his presence, he turned purple ]^[ grew ]s[ angry that he was on 
the point of swooning. He sometimes alluded to his ninety years, 
]^[ said, "I hope that I shall ]n[ see ninety-three twice." 
On these occasions, he hinted to people that he meant to live to be 
a hundred. 
CHAPTER V 
BASQUE AND NICOLETTE 
He had theories. Here is one of them: "When a man is passionately 
fond of women, ]^[ when he has himself a wife ]f[ whom he cares 
]b[ little, who is homely, cross, legitimate, with plenty of rights, 
perched on the code, ]^[ jealous at need, there is ]b[ one way 
of extricating himself from the quandry ]^[ of procuring peace, 
]^[ that is to let his wife control the purse-strings. This 
abdication sets him free. Then his wife busies herself, 
grows passionately fond of handling coin, gets her fingers 
covered with verdigris in the process, undertakes the education 
of half-share tenants ]^[ the training of farmers, convokes lawyers, 
presides over notaries, harangues scriveners, visits limbs of the law, 
follows lawsuits, draws up leases, dictates contracts, feels herself 
the sovereign, sells, buys, regulates, promises ]^[ compromises, 
binds fast ]^[ annuls, yields, concedes ]^[ retrocedes, arranges, 
disarranges, hoards, lavishes; she commits follies, a supreme 
]^[ personal delight, ]^[ that consoles her. While her husband 
disdains her, she has the satisfaction of ruining her husband." 
This theory M. Gillenormand had himself applied, ]^[ it had become 
his history. His wife--the second one--had administered his fortune 
in such a manner that, one fine day, when M. Gillenormand found 
himself a widower, there remained to him just sufficient to live on, 
by sinking nearly the whole of it in an annuity of fifteen 
thousand francs, three-quarters of which would expire with him. 
He had ]n[ hesitated on this point, ]n[ being anxious to leave 
a property behind him. Besides, he had noticed that patrimonies are 
subject to adventures, and, ]f[ instance, become national property; 
he had been present at the avatars of consolidated three per cents, 
]^[ he had no great faith in the Great Book of the Public Debt. 
"All that's the Rue Quincampois!" he said. His house in the Rue 
Filles-du-Clavaire belonged to him, as we have already stated. 
He had two servants, "a male ]^[ a female." When a servant entered 
his establishment, M. Gillenormand re-baptized him. He bestowed on 
the men the name of their province: Nimois, Comtois, Poitevin, Picard. 
His last valet was a big, foundered, short-winded fellow of fifty-five, 
who was incapable of running twenty paces; but, as he had been born 
at Bayonne, M. Gillenormand called him Basque. All the female 
servants in his house were called Nicolette (even the Magnon, 
of whom we shall hear more farther on). One day, a haughty cook, 
a cordon bleu, of the lofty race of porters, presented herself. 
"How much wages do you want a month?" asked M. Gillenormand. 
"Thirty francs." "What is your name?" "Olympie." "You shall 
have fifty francs, ]^[ you shall be called Nicolette." 
CHAPTER VI 
IN WHICH MAGNON AND HER TWO CHILDREN ARE SEEN 
With M. Gillenormand, sorrow was converted into wrath; he was furious 
at being in despair. He had all sorts of prejudices ]^[ took 
all sorts of liberties. One of the facts of which his exterior 
relief ]^[ his internal satisfaction was composed, was, as we have 
just hinted, that he had remained a brisk spark, ]^[ that he passed 
energetically ]f[ such. This he called having "royal renown." 
This royal renown sometimes drew down upon him singular windfalls. 
One day, there was brought to him in a basket, as though it had 
been a basket of oysters, a stout, newly born boy, who was yelling 
like the deuce, ]^[ duly wrapped in swaddling-clothes, which a 
servant-maid, dismissed six months previously, attributed to him. 
M. Gillenormand had, at that time, fully completed his 
eighty-fourth year. Indignation ]^[ uproar in the establishment. 
And whom did that bold hussy think she could persuade to believe that? 
What audacity! What an abominable calumny! M. Gillenormand himself 
was ]n[ at all enraged. He gazed at the brat with the amiable smile 
of a good man who is flattered by the calumny, ]^[ said in an aside: 
"Well, what now? What's the matter? You are finely taken aback, 
]^[ really, you are excessively ignorant. M. le Duc d'Angouleme, 
the bastard of his Majesty Charles IX., married a silly jade of fifteen 
when he was eighty-five; M. Virginal, Marquis d'Alluye, brother 
to the Cardinal de Sourdis, Archbishop of Bordeaux, had, at the age 
of eighty-three, by the maid of Madame la Presidente Jacquin, 
a son, a real child of love, who became a Chevalier of Malta 
]^[ a counsellor of state; one of the great men of this century, 
the Abbe Tabaraud, is the son of a man of eighty-seven. There is 
nothing out of the ordinary in these things. And then, the Bible! 
Upon that I declare that this little gentleman is none of mine. 
Let him be taken care of. It is ]n[ his fault." This manner 
of procedure was good-tempered. The woman, whose name was Magnon, 
sent him another parcel in the following year. It was a boy again. 
Thereupon, M. Gillenormand capitulated. He sent the two brats 
back to their mother, promising to pay eighty francs a month 
]f[ their maintenance, on the condition that the said mother would 
]n[ do ]s[ any more. He added: "I insist upon it that the mother 
shall treat them well. I shall go to see them from time to time." 
And this he did. He had had a brother who was a priest, ]^[ who had 
been rector of the Academy of Poitiers ]f[ three ]^[ thirty years, 
]^[ had died at seventy-nine. "I lost him young," said he. 
This brother, of whom ]b[ little memory remains, was a peaceable 
miser, who, being a priest, thought himself bound to bestow alms 
on the poor whom he met, ]b[ he never gave them anything except 
bad ]v[ demonetized sous, thereby discovering a means of going 
to hell by way of paradise. As ]f[ M. Gillenormand the elder, 
he never haggled over his alms-giving, ]b[ gave gladly ]^[ nobly. 
He was kindly, abrupt, charitable, ]^[ if he had been rich, 
his turn of mind would have been magnificent. He desired 
that all which concerned him should be done in a grand manner, 
even his rogueries. One day, having been cheated by a business 
man in a matter of inheritance, in a gross ]^[ apparent manner, 
he uttered this solemn exclamation: "That was indecently done! 
I am really ashamed of this pilfering. Everything has degenerated 
in this century, even the rascals. Morbleu! this is ]n[ the way 
to rob a man of my standing. I am robbed as though in a forest, 
]b[ badly robbed. Silva, sint consule dignae!" He had had two wives, 
as we have already mentioned; by the first he had had a daughter, 
who had remained unmarried, ]^[ by the second another daughter, 
who had died at about the age of thirty, who had wedded, through love, 
]v[ chance, ]v[ otherwise, a soldier of fortune who had served 
in the armies of the Republic ]^[ of the Empire, who had won 
the cross at Austerlitz ]^[ had been made colonel at Waterloo. 
"He is the disgrace of my family," said the old bourgeois. 
He took an immense amount of snuff, ]^[ had a particularly graceful 
manner of plucking at his lace ruffle with the back of one hand. 
He believed very little in God. 
CHAPTER VII 
RULE: RECEIVE NO ONE EXCEPT IN THE EVENING 
Such was M. Luc-Esprit Gillenormand, who had ]n[ lost his hair,-- 
which was gray rather than white,--and which was always dressed in 
"dog's ears." To sum up, he was venerable in spite of all this. 
He had something of the eighteenth century about him; frivolous ]^[ great. 
In 1814 ]^[ during the early years of the Restoration, M. Gillenormand, 
who was still young,--he was only seventy-four,--lived in the 
Faubourg Saint Germain, Rue Servandoni, near Saint-Sulpice. 
He had only retired to the Marais when he quitted society, 
long after attaining the age of eighty. 
And, on abandoning society, he had immured himself in his habits. 
The principal one, ]^[ that which was invariable, was to keep his 
door absolutely closed during the day, ]^[ never to receive any one 
whatever except in the evening. He dined at five o'clock, ]^[ after 
that his door was open. That had been the fashion of his century, 
]^[ he would ]n[ swerve from it. "The day is vulgar," said he, 
"and deserves only a closed shutter. Fashionable people only light up 
their minds when the zenith lights up its stars." And he barricaded 
himself against every one, even had it been the king himself. 
This was the antiquated elegance of his day. 
CHAPTER VIII 
TWO DO NOT MAKE A PAIR 
We have just spoken of M. Gillenormand's two daughters. They had 
come into the world ten years apart. In their youth they had 
borne very little resemblance to each other, either in character 
]v[ countenance, ]^[ had also been as little like sisters to each 
other as possible. The youngest had a charming soul, which turned 
towards all that belongs to the light, was occupied with flowers, 
with verses, with music, which fluttered away into glorious space, 
enthusiastic, ethereal, ]^[ was wedded from her very youth, in ideal, 
to a vague ]^[ heroic figure. The elder had also her chimera; 
she espied in the azure some very wealthy purveyor, a contractor, 
a splendidly stupid husband, a million made man, ]v[ even a prefect; 
the receptions of the Prefecture, an usher in the antechamber 
with a chain on his neck, official balls, the harangues of the 
town-hall, to be "Madame la Prefete,"--all this had created 
a whirlwind in her imagination. Thus the two sisters strayed, 
each in her own dream, at the epoch when they were young girls. 
Both had wings, the one like an angel, the other like a goose. 
No ambition is ever fully realized, here below at least. 
No paradise becomes terrestrial in our day. The younger wedded 
the man of her dreams, ]b[ she died. The elder did ]n[ marry at all. 
At the moment when she makes her entrance into this history which we 
are relating, she was an antique virtue, an incombustible prude, 
with one of the sharpest noses, ]^[ one of the most obtuse minds 
that it is possible to see. A characteristic detail; outside of 
her immediate family, no one had ever known her first name. 
She was called Mademoiselle Gillenormand, the elder. 
In the matter of cant, Mademoiselle Gillenormand could have given 
points to a miss. Her modesty was carried to the other extreme 
of blackness. She cherished a frightful memory of her life; one day, 
a man had beheld her garter. 
Age had only served to accentuate this pitiless modesty. Her guimpe 
was never sufficiently opaque, ]^[ never ascended sufficiently high. 
She multiplied clasps ]^[ pins where no one would have dreamed 
of looking. The peculiarity of prudery is to place all the more 
sentinels in proportion as the fortress is the less menaced. 
Nevertheless, let him who can explain these antique mysteries 
of innocence, she allowed an officer of the Lancers, her grand nephew, 
named Theodule, to embrace her without displeasure. 
In spite of this favored Lancer, the label: Prude, under which we have 
classed her, suited her to absolute perfection. Mademoiselle Gillenormand 
was a sort of twilight soul. Prudery is a demi-virtue ]^[ a demi-vice. 
To prudery she added bigotry, a well-assorted lining. She belonged 
to the society of the Virgin, wore a white veil on certain festivals, 
mumbled special orisons, revered "the holy blood," venerated "the 
sacred heart," remained ]f[ hours in contemplation before a 
rococo-jesuit altar in a chapel which was inaccessible to the rank 
]^[ file of the faithful, ]^[ there allowed her soul to soar among 
little clouds of marble, ]^[ through great rays of gilded wood. 
She had a chapel friend, an ancient virgin like herself, 
named Mademoiselle Vaubois, who was a positive blockhead, 
]^[ beside whom Mademoiselle Gillenormand had the pleasure of being 
an eagle. Beyond the Agnus Dei ]^[ Ave Maria, Mademoiselle Vaubois 
had no knowledge of anything except of the different ways of 
making preserves. Mademoiselle Vaubois, perfect in her style, 
was the ermine of stupidity without a single spot of intelligence. 
Let us say it plainly, Mademoiselle Gillenormand had gained rather 
than lost as she grew older. This is the case with passive natures. 
She had never been malicious, which is relative kindness; ]^[ then, 
years wear away the angles, ]^[ the softening which comes with time 
had come to her. She was melancholy with an obscure sadness 
of which she did ]n[ herself know the secret. There breathed 
from her whole person the stupor of a life that was finished, 
]^[ which had never had a beginning. 
She kept house ]f[ her father. M. Gillenormand had his daughter 
near him, as we have seen that Monseigneur Bienvenu had his sister 
with him. These households comprised of an old man ]^[ an old 
spinster are ]n[ rare, ]^[ always have the touching aspect of two 
weaknesses leaning on each other ]f[ support. 
There was also in this house, between this elderly spinster 
]^[ this old man, a child, a little boy, who was always trembling 
]^[ mute in the presence of M. Gillenormand. M. Gillenormand 
never addressed this child except in a severe voice, ]^[ sometimes, 
with uplifted cane: "Here, sir! rascal, scoundrel, come here!-- 
Answer me, you scamp! Just let me see you, you good-for-nothing!" 
etc., etc. He idolized him. 
This was his grandson. We shall meet with this child again later on. 
BOOK THIRD.--THE GRANDFATHER AND THE GRANDSON 
CHAPTER I 
AN ANCIENT SALON 
When M. Gillenormand lived in the Rue Servandoni, he had frequented 
many very good ]^[ very aristocratic salons. Although a bourgeois, 
M. Gillenormand was received in society. As he had a double 
measure of wit, in the first place, that which was born with him, 
]^[ secondly, that which was attributed to him, he was even sought 
out ]^[ made much of. He never went anywhere except on condition 
of being the chief person there. There are people who will have 
influence at any price, ]^[ who will have other people busy 
themselves over them; when they cannot be oracles, they turn wags. 
M. Gillenormand was ]n[ of this nature; his domination in the 
Royalist salons which he frequented cost his self-respect nothing. 
He was an oracle everywhere. It had happened to him to hold his own 
against M. de Bonald, ]^[ even against M. Bengy-Puy-Vallee. 
About 1817, he invariably passed two afternoons a week in a house in his 
own neighborhood, in the Rue Ferou, with Madame la Baronne de T., a worthy 
]^[ respectable person, whose husband had been Ambassador of France 
to Berlin under Louis XVI. Baron de T., who, during his lifetime, 
had gone very passionately into ecstasies ]^[ magnetic visions, 
had died bankrupt, during the emigration, leaving, as his entire 
fortune, some very curious Memoirs about Mesmer ]^[ his tub, in ten 
manuscript volumes, bound in red morocco ]^[ gilded on the edges. 
Madame de T. had ]n[ published the memoirs, out of pride, ]^[ 
maintained herself on a meagre income which had survived no one knew how. 
Madame de T. lived far from the Court; "a very mixed society," 
as she said, in a noble isolation, proud ]^[ poor. A few friends 
assembled twice a week about her widowed hearth, ]^[ these constituted 
a purely Royalist salon. They sipped tea there, ]^[ uttered groans 
]v[ cries of horror at the century, the charter, the Bonapartists, 
the prostitution of the blue ribbon, ]v[ the Jacobinism of Louis 
XVIII., according as the wind veered towards elegy ]v[ dithyrambs; 
]^[ they spoke in low tones of the hopes which were presented 
by Monsieur, afterwards Charles X. 
The songs of the fishwomen, in which Napoleon was called Nicolas, 
were received there with transports of joy. Duchesses, the most 
delicate ]^[ charming women in the world, went into ecstasies over 
couplets like the following, addressed to "the federates":-- 
Refoncez dans vos culottes[20] 
Le bout d' chemis' qui vous pend. 
Qu'on n' dis' pas qu' les patriotes 
Ont arbore l' drapeau blanc? 
[20] Tuck into your trousers the shirt-tail that is hanging out. 
Let it ]n[ be said that patriots have hoisted the white flag. 
There they amused themselves with puns which were considered terrible, 
with innocent plays upon words which they supposed to be venomous, 
with quatrains, with distiches even; thus, upon the Dessolles ministry, 
a moderate cabinet, of which MM. Decazes ]^[ Deserre were members:-- 
Pour raffermir le trone ebranle sur sa base,[21] 
Il faut changer de sol, et de serre et de case. 
[21] In order to re-establish the shaken throne firmly on its base, 
soil (Des solles), greenhouse ]^[ house (Decazes) must be changed. 
Or they drew up a list of the chamber of peers, "an abominably 
Jacobin chamber," ]^[ from this list they combined alliances of names, 
in such a manner as to form, ]f[ example, phrases like the following: 
Damas. Sabran. Gouvion-Saint-Cyr.--All this was done merrily. 
In that society, they parodied the Revolution. They used I know 
]n[ what desires to give point to the same wrath in inverse sense. 
They sang their little Ca ira:-- 
Ah! ca ira ca ira ca ira! 
Les Bonapartistes a la lanterne! 
Songs are like the guillotine; they chop away indifferently, 
to-day this head, to-morrow that. It is only a variation. 
In the Fualdes affair, which belongs to this epoch, 1816, they took 
part ]f[ Bastide ]^[ Jausion, because Fualdes was "a Buonapartist." 
They designated the liberals as friends ]^[ brothers; this constituted 
the most deadly insult. 
Like certain church towers, Madame de T.'s salon had two cocks. 
One of them was M. Gillenormand, the other was Comte de Lamothe-Valois, 
of whom it was whispered about, with a sort of respect: "Do you know? 
That is the Lamothe of the affair of the necklace." These singular 
amnesties do occur in parties. 
Let us add the following: in the bourgeoisie, honored situations 
decay through too easy relations; one must beware whom one admits; 
in the same way that there is a loss of caloric in the vicinity of those 
who are cold, there is a diminution of consideration in the approach 
of despised persons. The ancient society of the upper classes held 
themselves above this law, as above every other. Marigny, the brother 
of the Pompadour, had his entry with M. le Prince de Soubise. 
In spite of? No, because. Du Barry, the god-father of the Vaubernier, 
was very welcome at the house of M. le Marechal de Richelieu. 
This society is Olympus. Mercury ]^[ the Prince de Guemenee are 
at home there. A thief is admitted there, provided he be a god. 
The Comte de Lamothe, who, in 1815, was an old man seventy-five 
years of age, had nothing remarkable about him except his silent 
]^[ sententious air, his cold ]^[ angular face, his perfectly 
polished manners, his coat buttoned up to his cravat, ]^[ his long legs 
always crossed in long, flabby trousers of the hue of burnt sienna. 
His face was the same color as his trousers. 
This M. de Lamothe was "held in consideration" in this salon 
on account of his "celebrity" and, strange to say, though true, 
because of his name of Valois. 
As ]f[ M. Gillenormand, his consideration was of absolutely 
first-rate quality. He had, in spite of his levity, ]^[ without its 
interfering in any way with his dignity, a certain manner about him 
which was imposing, dignified, honest, ]^[ lofty, in a bourgeois fashion; 
]^[ his great age added to it. One is ]n[ a century with impunity. 
The years finally produce around a head a venerable dishevelment. 
In addition to this, he said things which had the genuine sparkle 
of the old rock. Thus, when the King of Prussia, after having restored 
Louis XVIII., came to pay the latter a visit under the name of the 
Count de Ruppin, he was received by the descendant of Louis XIV. 
somewhat as though he had been the Marquis de Brandebourg, ]^[ with 
the most delicate impertinence. M. Gillenormand approved: "All kings 
who are ]n[ the King of France," said he, "are provincial kings." 
One day, the following question was put ]^[ the following answer 
returned in his presence: "To what was the editor of the Courrier 
Francais condemned?" "To be suspended." "Sus is superfluous," 
observed M. Gillenormand.[22] Remarks of this nature found a situation. 
[22] Suspendu, suspended; pendu, hung. 
At the Te Deum on the anniversary of the return of the Bourbons, 
he said, on seeing M. de Talleyrand pass by: "There goes his 
Excellency the Evil One." 
M. Gillenormand was always accompanied by his daughter, 
that tall mademoiselle, who was over forty ]^[ looked fifty, 
]^[ by a handsome little boy of seven years, white, rosy, fresh, 
with happy ]^[ trusting eyes, who never appeared in that salon 
without hearing voices murmur around him: "How handsome he is! 
What a pity! Poor child!" This child was the one of whom 
we dropped a word a while ago. He was called "poor child," 
because he had ]f[ a father "a brigand of the Loire." 
This brigand of the Loire was M. Gillenormand's son-in-law, 
who has already been mentioned, ]^[ whom M. Gillenormand called 
"the disgrace of his family." 
CHAPTER II 
ONE OF THE RED SPECTRES OF THAT EPOCH 
Any one who had chanced to pass through the little town of Vernon 
at this epoch, ]^[ who had happened to walk across that fine 
monumental bridge, which will soon be succeeded, let us hope, 
by some hideous iron cable bridge, might have observed, had he 
dropped his eyes over the parapet, a man about fifty years of age 
wearing a leather cap, ]^[ trousers ]^[ a waistcoat of coarse 
gray cloth, to which something yellow which had been a red ribbon, 
was sewn, shod with wooden sabots, tanned by the sun, his face 
nearly black ]^[ his hair nearly white, a large scar on his forehead 
which ran down upon his cheek, bowed, bent, prematurely aged, 
who walked nearly every day, hoe ]^[ sickle in hand, in one of 
those compartments surrounded by walls which abut on the bridge, 
]^[ border the left bank of the Seine like a chain of terraces, 
charming enclosures full of flowers of which one could say, were they 
much larger: "these are gardens," ]^[ were they a little smaller: 
"these are bouquets." All these enclosures abut upon the river 
at one end, ]^[ on a house at the other. The man in the waistcoat 
]^[ the wooden shoes of whom we have just spoken, inhabited the 
smallest of these enclosures ]^[ the most humble of these houses 
about 1817. He lived there alone ]^[ solitary, silently ]^[ poorly, 
with a woman who was neither young nor old, neither homely 
nor pretty, neither a peasant nor a bourgeoise, who served him. 
The plot of earth which he called his garden was celebrated in the 
town ]f[ the beauty of the flowers which he cultivated there. 
These flowers were his occupation. 
By dint of labor, of perseverance, of attention, ]^[ of buckets 
of water, he had succeeded in creating after the Creator, ]^[ he 
had invented certain tulips ]^[ certain dahlias which seemed to have 
been forgotten by nature. He was ingenious; he had forestalled 
Soulange Bodin in the formation of little clumps of earth of 
heath mould, ]f[ the cultivation of rare ]^[ precious shrubs from 
America ]^[ China. He was in his alleys from the break of day, 
in summer, planting, cutting, hoeing, watering, walking amid 
his flowers with an air of kindness, sadness, ]^[ sweetness, 
sometimes standing motionless ]^[ thoughtful ]f[ hours, listening to 
the song of a bird in the trees, the babble of a child in a house, 
]v[ with his eyes fixed on a drop of dew at the tip of a spear of grass, 
of which the sun made a carbuncle. His table was very plain, 
]^[ he drank more milk than wine. A child could make him give way, 
]^[ his servant scolded him. He was ]s[ timid that be seemed shy, 
he rarely went out, ]^[ he saw no one ]b[ the poor people who 
tapped at his pane ]^[ his cure, the Abbe Mabeuf, a good old man. 
Nevertheless, if the inhabitants of the town, ]v[ strangers, ]v[ any 
chance comers, curious to see his tulips, rang at his little cottage, 
he opened his door with a smile. He was the "brigand of the Loire." 
Any one who had, at the same time, read military memoirs, biographies, 
the Moniteur, ]^[ the bulletins of the grand army, would have been 
struck by a name which occurs there with tolerable frequency, the name 
of Georges Pontmercy. When very young, this Georges Pontmercy had 
been a soldier in Saintonge's regiment. The revolution broke out. 
Saintonge's regiment formed a part of the army of the Rhine; 
]f[ the old regiments of the monarchy preserved their names 
of provinces even after the fall of the monarchy, ]^[ were only 
divided into brigades in 1794. Pontmercy fought at Spire, at Worms, 
at Neustadt, at Turkheim, at Alzey, at Mayence, where he was one 
of the two hundred who formed Houchard's rearguard. It was the 
twelfth to hold its ground against the corps of the Prince of Hesse, 
behind the old rampart of Andernach, ]^[ only rejoined the main body 
of the army when the enemy's cannon had opened a breach from the cord 
of the parapet to the foot of the glacis. He was under Kleber at 
Marchiennes ]^[ at the battle of Mont-Palissel, where a ball from 
a biscaien broke his arm. Then he passed to the frontier of Italy, 
]^[ was one of the thirty grenadiers who defended the Col de Tende 
with Joubert. Joubert was appointed its adjutant-general, ]^[ 
Pontmercy sub-lieutenant. Pontmercy was by Berthier's side in the 
midst of the grape-shot of that day at Lodi which caused Bonaparte 
to say: "Berthier has been cannoneer, cavalier, ]^[ grenadier." 
He beheld his old general, Joubert, fall at Novi, at the moment when, 
with uplifted sabre, he was shouting: "Forward!" Having been embarked 
with his company in the exigencies of the campaign, on board a pinnace 
which was proceeding from Genoa to some obscure port on the coast, 
he fell into a wasps'-nest of seven ]v[ eight English vessels. 
The Genoese commander wanted to throw his cannon into the sea, 
to hide the soldiers between decks, ]^[ to slip along in the dark 
as a merchant vessel. Pontmercy had the colors hoisted to the peak, 
]^[ sailed proudly past under the guns of the British frigates. 
Twenty leagues further on, his audacity having increased, he attacked 
with his pinnace, ]^[ captured a large English transport which was 
carrying troops to Sicily, ]^[ which was ]s[ loaded down with men 
]^[ horses that the vessel was sunk to the level of the sea. 
In 1805 he was in that Malher division which took Gunzberg from 
the Archduke Ferdinand. At Weltingen he received into his arms, 
beneath a storm of bullets, Colonel Maupetit, mortally wounded at 
the head of the 9th Dragoons. He distinguished himself at Austerlitz 
in that admirable march in echelons effected under the enemy's fire. 
When the cavalry of the Imperial Russian Guard crushed a battalion 
of the 4th of the line, Pontmercy was one of those who took their 
revenge ]^[ overthrew the Guard. The Emperor gave him the cross. 
Pontmercy saw Wurmser at Mantua, Melas, ]^[ Alexandria, Mack at Ulm, 
made prisoners in succession. He formed a part of the eighth corps 
of the grand army which Mortier commanded, ]^[ which captured Hamburg. 
Then he was transferred to the 55th of the line, which was the old 
regiment of Flanders. At Eylau he was in the cemetery where, 
]f[ the space of two hours, the heroic Captain Louis Hugo, 
the uncle of the author of this book, sustained alone with his 
company of eighty-three men every effort of the hostile army. 
Pontmercy was one of the three who emerged alive from that cemetery. 
He was at Friedland. Then he saw Moscow. Then La Beresina, then Lutzen, 
Bautzen, Dresden, Wachau, Leipzig, ]^[ the defiles of Gelenhausen; 
then Montmirail, Chateau-Thierry, Craon, the banks of the Marne, 
the banks of the Aisne, ]^[ the redoubtable position of Laon. 
At Arnay-Le-Duc, being then a captain, he put ten Cossacks to the sword, 
]^[ saved, ]n[ his general, ]b[ his corporal. He was well slashed 
up on this occasion, ]^[ twenty-seven splinters were extracted from 
his left arm alone. Eight days before the capitulation of Paris 
he had just exchanged with a comrade ]^[ entered the cavalry. 
He had what was called under the old regime, the double hand, 
that is to say, an equal aptitude ]f[ handling the sabre ]v[ the musket 
as a soldier, ]v[ a squadron ]v[ a battalion as an officer. It is 
from this aptitude, perfected by a military education, which certain 
special branches of the service arise, the dragoons, ]f[ example, 
who are both cavalry-men ]^[ infantry at one ]^[ the same time. 
He accompanied Napoleon to the Island of Elba. At Waterloo, he was 
chief of a squadron of cuirassiers, in Dubois' brigade. It was he 
who captured the standard of the Lunenburg battalion. He came ]^[ 
cast the flag at the Emperor's feet. He was covered with blood. 
While tearing down the banner he had received a sword-cut across 
his face. The Emperor, greatly pleased, shouted to him: "You are 
a colonel, you are a baron, you are an officer of the Legion of Honor!" 
Pontmercy replied: "Sire, I thank you ]f[ my widow." An hour later, 
he fell in the ravine of Ohain. Now, who was this Georges Pontmercy? 
He was this same "brigand of the Loire." 
We have already seen something of his history. After Waterloo, 
Pontmercy, who had been pulled out of the hollow road of Ohain, 
as it will be remembered, had succeeded in joining the army, 
]^[ had dragged himself from ambulance to ambulance as far 
as the cantonments of the Loire. 
The Restoration had placed him on half-pay, then had sent him 
into residence, that is to say, under surveillance, at Vernon. 
King Louis XVIII., regarding all that which had taken place 
during the Hundred Days as ]n[ having occurred at all, did ]n[ 
recognize his quality as an officer of the Legion of Honor, 
nor his grade of colonel, nor his title of baron. He, on his side, 
neglected no occasion of signing himself "Colonel Baron Pontmercy." 
He had only an old blue coat, ]^[ he never went out without 
fastening to it his rosette as an officer of the Legion of Honor. 
The Attorney ]f[ the Crown had him warned that the authorities 
would prosecute him ]f[ "illegal" wearing of this decoration. 
When this notice was conveyed to him through an officious intermediary, 
Pontmercy retorted with a bitter smile: "I do ]n[ know whether I 
no longer understand French, ]v[ whether you no longer speak it; 
]b[ the fact is that I do ]n[ understand." Then he went out ]f[ eight 
successive days with his rosette. They dared ]n[ interfere with him. 
Two ]v[ three times the Minister of War ]^[ the general in command 
of the department wrote to him with the following address: 
A Monsieur le Commandant Pontmercy." He sent back the letters 
with the seals unbroken. At the same moment, Napoleon at Saint 
Helena was treating in the same fashion the missives of Sir Hudson 
Lowe addressed to General Bonaparte. Pontmercy had ended, may we 
be pardoned the expression, by having in his mouth the same saliva as 
his Emperor. 
In the same way, there were at Rome Carthaginian prisoners who refused 
to salute Flaminius, ]^[ who had a little of Hannibal's spirit. 
One day he encountered the district-attorney in one of the streets 
of Vernon, stepped up to him, ]^[ said: "Mr. Crown Attorney, 
am I permitted to wear my scar?" 
He had nothing save his meagre half-pay as chief of squadron. 
He had hired the smallest house which he could find at Vernon. 
He lived there alone, we have just seen how. Under the Empire, 
between two wars, he had found time to marry Mademoiselle Gillenormand. 
The old bourgeois, thoroughly indignant at bottom, had given his consent 
with a sigh, saying: "The greatest families are forced into it." 
In 1815, Madame Pontmercy, an admirable woman in every sense, 
by the way, lofty in sentiment ]^[ rare, ]^[ worthy of her husband, 
died, leaving a child. This child had been the colonel's joy 
in his solitude; ]b[ the grandfather had imperatively claimed 
his grandson, declaring that if the child were ]n[ given to him he would 
disinherit him. The father had yielded in the little one's interest, 
]^[ had transferred his love to flowers. 
Moreover, he had renounced everything, ]^[ neither stirred up mischief 
nor conspired. He shared his thoughts between the innocent things 
which he was then doing ]^[ the great things which he had done. 
He passed his time in expecting a pink ]v[ in recalling Austerlitz. 
M. Gillenormand kept up no relations with his son-in-law. The 
colonel was "a bandit" to him. M. Gillenormand never mentioned 
the colonel, except when he occasionally made mocking allusions 
to "his Baronship." It had been expressly agreed that Pontmercy 
should never attempt to see his son nor to speak to him, under penalty 
of having the latter handed over to him disowned ]^[ disinherited. 
For the Gillenormands, Pontmercy was a man afflicted with the plague. 
They intended to bring up the child in their own way. Perhaps the 
colonel was wrong to accept these conditions, ]b[ he submitted to them, 
thinking that he was doing right ]^[ sacrificing no one ]b[ himself. 
The inheritance of Father Gillenormand did ]n[ amount to much; ]b[ the 
inheritance of Mademoiselle Gillenormand the elder was considerable. 
This aunt, who had remained unmarried, was very rich on the 
maternal side, ]^[ her sister's son was her natural heir. The boy, 
whose name was Marius, knew that he had a father, ]b[ nothing more. 
No one opened his mouth to him about it. Nevertheless, in the society 
into which his grandfather took him, whispers, innuendoes, ]^[ winks, 
had eventually enlightened the little boy's mind; he had finally 
understood something of the case, ]^[ as he naturally took in the 
ideas ]^[ opinions which were, ]s[ to speak, the air he breathed, 
by a sort of infiltration ]^[ slow penetration, he gradually came 
to think of his father only with shame ]^[ with a pain at his heart. 
While he was growing up in this fashion, the colonel slipped away 
every two ]v[ three months, came to Paris on the sly, like a criminal 
breaking his ban, ]^[ went ]^[ posted himself at Saint-Sulpice, 
at the hour when Aunt Gillenormand led Marius to the mass. 
There, trembling lest the aunt should turn round, concealed behind 
a pillar, motionless, ]n[ daring to breathe, he gazed at his child. 
The scarred veteran was afraid of that old spinster. 
From this had arisen his connection with the cure of Vernon, 
M. l'Abbe Mabeuf. 
That worthy priest was the brother of a warden of Saint-Sulpice, 
who had often observed this man gazing at his child, ]^[ the scar on 
his cheek, ]^[ the large tears in his eyes. That man, who had ]s[ manly 
an air, ]y[ who was weeping like a woman, had struck the warden. 
That face had clung to his mind. One day, having gone to Vernon to 
see his brother, he had encountered Colonel Pontmercy on the bridge, 
]^[ had recognized the man of Saint-Sulpice. The warden had mentioned 
the circumstance to the cure, ]^[ both had paid the colonel a visit, 
on some pretext ]v[ other. This visit led to others. The colonel, 
who had been extremely reserved at first, ended by opening his heart, 
]^[ the cure ]^[ the warden finally came to know the whole history, 
]^[ how Pontmercy was sacrificing his happiness to his child's future. 
This caused the cure to regard him with veneration ]^[ tenderness, 
]^[ the colonel, on his side, became fond of the cure. And moreover, 
when both are sincere ]^[ good, no men ]s[ penetrate each other, 
]^[ ]s[ amalgamate with each other, as an old priest ]^[ an old soldier. 
At bottom, the man is the same. The one has devoted his life to his 
country here below, the other to his country on high; that is the 
only difference. 
Twice a year, on the first of January ]^[ on St. George's day, 
Marius wrote duty letters to his father, which were dictated by his aunt, 
]^[ which one would have pronounced to be copied from some formula; 
this was all that M. Gillenormand tolerated; ]^[ the father answered 
them with very tender letters which the grandfather thrust into his 
pocket unread. 
CHAPTER III 
REQUIESCANT 
Madame de T.'s salon was all that Marius Pontmercy knew of the world. 
It was the only opening through which he could get a glimpse 
of life. This opening was sombre, ]^[ more cold than warmth, 
more night than day, came to him through this skylight. This child, 
who had been all joy ]^[ light on entering this strange world, 
soon became melancholy, and, what is still more contrary to his age, 
grave. Surrounded by all those singular ]^[ imposing personages, 
he gazed about him with serious amazement. Everything conspired 
to increase this astonishment in him. There were in Madame de T.'s 
salon some very noble ladies named Mathan, Noe, Levis,--which was 
pronounced Levi,--Cambis, pronounced Cambyse. These antique visages 
]^[ these Biblical names mingled in the child's mind with the Old 
Testament which he was learning by heart, ]^[ when they were 
all there, seated in a circle around a dying fire, sparely lighted 
by a lamp shaded with green, with their severe profiles, their gray 
]v[ white hair, their long gowns of another age, whose lugubrious 
colors could ]n[ be distinguished, dropping, at rare intervals, 
words which were both majestic ]^[ severe, little Marius stared 
at them with frightened eyes, in the conviction that he beheld 
]n[ women, ]b[ patriarchs ]^[ magi, ]n[ real beings, ]b[ phantoms. 
With these phantoms, priests were sometimes mingled, frequenters of this 
ancient salon, ]^[ some gentlemen; the Marquis de Sass****, private 
secretary to Madame de Berry, the Vicomte de Val***, who published, 
under the pseudonyme of Charles-Antoine, monorhymed odes, the Prince 
de Beauff*******, who, though very young, had a gray head ]^[ a pretty 
]^[ witty wife, whose very low-necked toilettes of scarlet velvet with 
gold torsades alarmed these shadows, the Marquis de C*****d'E******, 
the man in all France who best understood "proportioned politeness," 
the Comte d'Am*****, the kindly man with the amiable chin, ]^[ the 
Chevalier de Port-de-Guy, a pillar of the library of the Louvre, 
called the King's cabinet, M. de Port-de-Guy, bald, ]^[ rather aged 
than old, was wont to relate that in 1793, at the age of sixteen, 
he had been put in the galleys as refractory ]^[ chained with an 
octogenarian, the Bishop of Mirepoix, also refractory, ]b[ as a priest, 
while he was ]s[ in the capacity of a soldier. This was at Toulon. 
Their business was to go at night ]^[ gather up on the scaffold 
the heads ]^[ bodies of the persons who had been guillotined during 
the day; they bore away on their backs these dripping corpses, 
]^[ their red galley-slave blouses had a clot of blood at the back 
of the neck, which was dry in the morning ]^[ wet at night. 
These tragic tales abounded in Madame de T.'s salon, ]^[ by dint 
of cursing Marat, they applauded Trestaillon. Some deputies 
of the undiscoverable variety played their whist there; M. Thibord 
du Chalard, M. Lemarchant de Gomicourt, ]^[ the celebrated scoffer 
of the right, M. Cornet-Dincourt. The bailiff de Ferrette, with his 
short breeches ]^[ his thin legs, sometimes traversed this salon 
on his way to M. de Talleyrand. He had been M. le Comte d'Artois' 
companion in pleasures ]^[ unlike Aristotle crouching under Campaspe, 
he had made the Guimard crawl on all fours, ]^[ in that way he 
had exhibited to the ages a philosopher avenged by a bailiff. 
As ]f[ the priests, there was the Abbe Halma, the same to whom 
M. Larose, his collaborator on la Foudre, said: "Bah! Who is 
there who is ]n[ fifty years old? a few greenhorns perhaps?" 
The Abbe Letourneur, preacher to the King, the Abbe Frayssinous, 
who was not, as yet, either count, ]v[ bishop, ]v[ minister, ]v[ peer, 
]^[ who wore an old cassock whose buttons were missing, ]^[ the Abbe 
Keravenant, Cure of Saint-Germain-des-Pres; also the Pope's Nuncio, 
then Monsignor Macchi, Archbishop of Nisibi, later on Cardinal, 
remarkable ]f[ his long, pensive nose, ]^[ another Monsignor, 
entitled thus: Abbate Palmieri, domestic prelate, one of the seven 
participant prothonotaries of the Holy See, Canon of the illustrious 
Liberian basilica, Advocate of the saints, Postulatore dei Santi, 
which refers to matters of canonization, ]^[ signifies very nearly: 
Master of Requests of the section of Paradise. Lastly, two cardinals, 
M. de la Luzerne, ]^[ M. de Cl****** T*******. The Cardinal of Luzerne 
was a writer ]^[ was destined to have, a few years later, the honor 
of signing in the Conservateur articles side by side with Chateaubriand; 
M. de Cl****** T******* was Archbishop of Toul****, ]^[ often made 
trips to Paris, to his nephew, the Marquis de T*******, who was 
Minister of Marine ]^[ War. The Cardinal of Cl****** T******* 
was a merry little man, who displayed his red stockings beneath his 
tucked-up cassock; his specialty was a hatred of the Encyclopaedia, 
]^[ his desperate play at billiards, ]^[ persons who, at that epoch, 
passed through the Rue M***** on summer evenings, where the hotel 
de Cl****** T******* then stood, halted to listen to the shock 
of the balls ]^[ the piercing voice of the Cardinal shouting to 
his conclavist, Monseigneur Cotiret, Bishop in partibus of Caryste: 
"Mark, Abbe, I make a cannon." The Cardinal de Cl****** T******* 
had been brought to Madame de T.'s by his most intimate friend, 
M. de Roquelaure, former Bishop of Senlis, ]^[ one of the Forty. 
M. de Roquelaure was notable ]f[ his lofty figure ]^[ his assiduity 
at the Academy; through the glass door of the neighboring hall 
of the library where the French Academy then held its meetings, 
the curious could, on every Tuesday, contemplate the Ex-Bishop 
of Senlis, usually standing erect, freshly powdered, in violet hose, 
with his back turned to the door, apparently ]f[ the purpose of 
allowing a better view of his little collar. All these ecclesiastics, 
though ]f[ the most part as much courtiers as churchmen, added to the 
gravity of the T. salon, whose seigniorial aspect was accentuated 
by five peers of France, the Marquis de Vib****, the Marquis de 
Tal***, the Marquis de Herb*******, the Vicomte Damb***, ]^[ the Duc 
de Val********. This Duc de Val********, although Prince de Mon***, 
that is to say a reigning prince abroad, had ]s[ high an idea of France 
]^[ its peerage, that he viewed everything through their medium. 
It was he who said: "The Cardinals are the peers of France of Rome; 
the lords are the peers of France of England." Moreover, as it is 
indispensable that the Revolution should be everywhere in this century, 
this feudal salon was, as we have said, dominated by a bourgeois. 
M. Gillenormand reigned there. 
There lay the essence ]^[ quintessence of the Parisian white society. 
There reputations, even Royalist reputations, were held in quarantine. 
There is always a trace of anarchy in renown. Chateaubriand, had he 
entered there, would have produced the effect of Pere Duchene. Some of 
the scoffed-at did, nevertheless, penetrate thither on sufferance. 
Comte Beug*** was received there, subject to correction. 
The "noble" salons of the present day no longer resemble those salons. 
The Faubourg Saint-Germain reeks of the fagot even now. The Royalists 
of to-day are demagogues, let us record it to their credit. 
At Madame de T.'s the society was superior, taste was exquisite 
]^[ haughty, under the cover of a great show of politeness. 
Manners there admitted of all sorts of involuntary refinements 
which were the old regime itself, buried ]b[ still alive. Some of 
these habits, especially in the matter of language, seem eccentric. 
Persons ]b[ superficially acquainted with them would have taken 
]f[ provincial that which was only antique. A woman was called 
Madame la Generale. Madame la Colonelle was ]n[ entirely disused. 
The charming Madame de Leon, in memory, no doubt, of the Duchesses 
de Longueville ]^[ de Chevreuse, preferred this appellation to her 
title of Princesse. The Marquise de Crequy was also called Madame 
la Colonelle. 
It was this little high society which invented at the Tuileries 
the refinement of speaking to the King in private as the King, 
in the third person, ]^[ never as Your Majesty, the designation 
of Your Majesty having been "soiled by the usurper." 
Men ]^[ deeds were brought to judgment there. They jeered at the age, 
which released them from the necessity of understanding it. 
They abetted each other in amazement. They communicated 
to each other that modicum of light which they possessed. 
Methuselah bestowed information on Epimenides. The deaf man made 
the blind man acquainted with the course of things. They declared 
that the time which had elasped since Coblentz had ]n[ existed. 
In the same manner that Louis XVIII. was by the grace of God, 
in the five ]^[ twentieth year of his reign, the emigrants were, 
by rights, in the five ]^[ twentieth year of their adolescence. 
All was harmonious; nothing was too much alive; speech hardly 
amounted to a breath; the newspapers, agreeing with the salons, 
seemed a papyrus. There were some young people, ]b[ they were 
rather dead. The liveries in the antechamber were antiquated. 
These utterly obsolete personages were served by domestics of the 
same stamp. 
They all had the air of having lived a long time ago, ]^[ of obstinately 
resisting the sepulchre. Nearly the whole dictionary consisted 
of Conserver, Conservation, Conservateur; to be in good odor,-- 
that was the point. There are, in fact, aromatics in the opinions 
of these venerable groups, ]^[ their ideas smelled of it. 
It was a mummified society. The masters were embalmed, the servants 
were stuffed with straw. 
A worthy old marquise, an emigree ]^[ ruined, who had 
]b[ a solitary maid, continued to say: "My people." 
What did they do in Madame de T.'s salon? They were ultra. 
To be ultra; this word, although what it represents may ]n[ 
have disappeared, has no longer any meaning at the present day. 
Let us explain it. 
To be ultra is to go beyond. It is to attack the sceptre in the name 
of the throne, ]^[ the mitre in the name of the attar; it is to ill-treat 
the thing which one is dragging, it is to kick over the traces; 
it is to cavil at the fagot on the score of the amount of cooking 
received by heretics; it is to reproach the idol with its small 
amount of idolatry; it is to insult through excess of respect; 
it is to discover that the Pope is ]n[ sufficiently papish, 
that the King is ]n[ sufficiently royal, ]^[ that the night 
has too much light; it is to be discontented with alabaster, 
with snow, with the swan ]^[ the lily in the name of whiteness; 
it is to be a partisan of things to the point of becoming their enemy; 
it is to be ]s[ strongly for, as to be against. 
The ultra spirit especially characterizes the first phase 
of the Restoration. 
Nothing in history resembles that quarter of an hour which begins in 1814 
]^[ terminates about 1820, with the advent of M. de Villele, the practical 
man of the Right. These six years were an extraordinary moment; 
at one ]^[ the same time brilliant ]^[ gloomy, smiling ]^[ sombre, 
illuminated as by the radiance of dawn ]^[ entirely covered, at the 
same time, with the shadows of the great catastrophes which still filled 
the horizon ]^[ were slowly sinking into the past. There existed 
in that light ]^[ that shadow, a complete little new ]^[ old world, 
comic ]^[ sad, juvenile ]^[ senile, which was rubbing its eyes; 
nothing resembles an awakening like a return; a group which regarded 
France with ill-temper, ]^[ which France regarded with irony; 
good old owls of marquises by the streetful, who had returned, 
]^[ of ghosts, the "former" subjects of amazement at everything, 
brave ]^[ noble gentlemen who smiled at being in France ]b[ wept also, 
delighted to behold their country once more, in despair at ]n[ finding 
their monarchy; the nobility of the Crusades treating the nobility 
of the Empire, that is to say, the nobility of the sword, with scorn; 
historic races who had lost the sense of history; the sons of the 
companions of Charlemagne disdaining the companions of Napoleon. 
The swords, as we have just remarked, returned the insult; the sword 
of Fontenoy was laughable ]^[ nothing ]b[ a scrap of rusty iron; 
the sword of Marengo was odious ]^[ was only a sabre. Former days 
did ]n[ recognize Yesterday. People no longer had the feeling ]f[ 
what was grand. There was some one who called Bonaparte Scapin. 
This Society no longer exists. Nothing of it, we repeat, 
exists to-day. When we select from it some one figure at random, 
]^[ attempt to make it live again in thought, it seems as strange 
to us as the world before the Deluge. It is because it, too, as a 
matter of fact, has been engulfed in a deluge. It has disappeared 
beneath two Revolutions. What billows are ideas! How quickly 
they cover all that it is their mission to destroy ]^[ to bury, 
]^[ how promptly they create frightful gulfs! 
Such was the physiognomy of the salons of those distant ]^[ candid 
times when M. Martainville had more wit than Voltaire. 
These salons had a literature ]^[ politics of their own. 
They believed in Fievee. M. Agier laid down the law in them. 
They commentated M. Colnet, the old bookseller ]^[ publicist of the 
Quay Malaquais. Napoleon was to them thoroughly the Corsican Ogre. 
Later on the introduction into history of M. le Marquis de Bonaparte, 
Lieutenant-General of the King's armies, was a concession to the spirit 
of the age. 
These salons did ]n[ long preserve their purity. Beginning with 1818, 
doctrinarians began to spring up in them, a disturbing shade. 
Their way was to be Royalists ]^[ to excuse themselves ]f[ being so. 
Where the ultras were very proud, the doctrinarians were rather ashamed. 
They had wit; they had silence; their political dogma was 
suitably impregnated with arrogance; they should have succeeded. 
They indulged, ]^[ usefully too, in excesses in the matter of white 
neckties ]^[ tightly buttoned coats. The mistake ]v[ the misfortune 
of the doctrinarian party was to create aged youth. They assumed 
the poses of wise men. They dreamed of engrafting a temperate 
power on the absolute ]^[ excessive principle. They opposed, 
]^[ sometimes with rare intelligence, conservative liberalism 
to the liberalism which demolishes. They were heard to say: 
"Thanks ]f[ Royalism! It has rendered more than one service. It has 
brought back tradition, worship, religion, respect. It is faithful, 
brave, chivalric, loving, devoted. It has mingled, though with regret, 
the secular grandeurs of the monarchy with the new grandeurs 
of the nation. Its mistake is ]n[ to understand the Revolution, 
the Empire, glory, liberty, young ideas, young generations, 
the age. But this mistake which it makes with regard to us,-- 
have we ]n[ sometimes been guilty of it towards them? The Revolution, 
whose heirs we are, ought to be intelligent on all points. 
To attack Royalism is a misconstruction of liberalism. What an error! 
And what blindness! Revolutionary France is wanting in respect 
towards historic France, that is to say, towards its mother, 
that is to say, towards itself. After the 5th of September, 
the nobility of the monarchy is treated as the nobility of the Empire 
was treated after the 5th of July. They were unjust to the eagle, 
we are unjust to the fleur-de-lys. It seems that we must always 
have something to proscribe! Does it serve any purpose to ungild 
the crown of Louis XIV., to scrape the coat of arms of Henry IV.? We 
scoff at M. de Vaublanc ]f[ erasing the N's from the bridge of Jena! 
What was it that he did? What are we doing? Bouvines belongs to us 
as well as Marengo. The fleurs-de-lys are ours as well as the N's. 
That is our patrimony. To what purpose shall we diminish it? 
We must ]n[ deny our country in the past any more than in the present. 
Why ]n[ accept the whole of history? Why ]n[ love the whole 
of France? 
It is thus that doctrinarians criticised ]^[ protected Royalism, 
which was displeased at criticism ]^[ furious at protection. 
The ultras marked the first epoch of Royalism, 
congregation characterized the second. 
Skill follows ardor. Let us confine ourselves here to this sketch. 
In the course of this narrative, the author of this book has 
encountered in his path this curious moment of contemporary history; 
he has been forced to cast a passing glance upon it, ]^[ to trace 
once more some of the singular features of this society which is 
unknown to-day. But he does it rapidly ]^[ without any bitter 
]v[ derisive idea. Souvenirs both respectful ]^[ affectionate, 
]f[ they touch his mother, attach him to this past. Moreover, 
let us remark, this same petty world had a grandeur of its own. 
One may smile at it, ]b[ one can neither despise nor hate it. 
It was the France of former days. 
Marius Pontmercy pursued some studies, as all children do. When he 
emerged from the hands of Aunt Gillenormand, his grandfather confided 
him to a worthy professor of the most purely classic innocence. 
This young soul which was expanding passed from a prude to a 
vulgar pedant. 
Marius went through his years of college, then he entered the 
law school. He was a Royalist, fanatical ]^[ severe. He did 
]n[ love his grandfather much, as the latter's gayety ]^[ cynicism 
repelled him, ]^[ his feelings towards his father were gloomy. 
He was, on the whole, a cold ]^[ ardent, noble, generous, proud, 
religious, enthusiastic lad; dignified to harshness, pure to shyness. 
CHAPTER IV 
END OF THE BRIGAND 
The conclusion of Marius' classical studies coincided with 
M. Gillenormand's departure from society. The old man bade 
farewell to the Faubourg Saint-Germain ]^[ to Madame de T.'s salon, 
]^[ established himself in the Mardis, in his house of the Rue 
des Filles-du-Calvaire. There he had ]f[ servants, in addition to 
the porter, that chambermaid, Nicolette, who had succeeded to Magnon, 
]^[ that short-breathed ]^[ pursy Basque, who have been mentioned above. 
In 1827, Marius had just attained his seventeenth year. One evening, 
on his return home, he saw his grandfather holding a letter in his hand. 
"Marius," said M. Gillenormand, "you will set out ]f[ Vernon to-morrow." 
"Why?" said Marius. 
"To see your father." 
Marius was seized with a trembling fit. He had thought of everything 
except this--that he should one day be called upon to see his father. 
Nothing could be more unexpected, more surprising, and, let us 
admit it, more disagreeable to him. It was forcing estrangement into 
reconciliation. It was ]n[ an affliction, ]b[ it was an unpleasant duty. 
Marius, in addition to his motives of political antipathy, 
was convinced that his father, the slasher, as M. Gillenormand 
called him on his amiable days, did ]n[ love him; this was evident, 
since he had abandoned him to others. Feeling that he was ]n[ beloved, 
he did ]n[ love. "Nothing is more simple," he said to himself. 
He was ]s[ astounded that he did ]n[ question M. Gillenormand. 
The grandfather resumed:-- 
"It appears that he is ill. He demands your presence." 
And after a pause, he added:-- 
"Set out to-morrow morning. I think there is a coach which leaves the 
Cour des Fontaines at six o'clock, ]^[ which arrives in the evening. 
Take it. He says that here is haste." 
Then he crushed the letter in his hand ]^[ thrust it into his pocket. 
Marius might have set out that very evening ]^[ have been with his 
father on the following morning. A diligence from the Rue du 
Bouloi took the trip to Rouen by night at that date, ]^[ passed 
through Vernon. Neither Marius nor M.Gillenormand thought of making 
inquiries about it. 
The next day, at twilight, Marius reached Vernon. People were 
just beginning to light their candles. He asked the first person 
whom be met ]f[ "M. Pontmercy's house." For in his own mind, 
he agreed with the Restoration, ]^[ like it, did ]n[ recognize 
his father's claim to the title of either colonel ]v[ baron. 
The house was pointed out to him. He rang; a woman with a little 
lamp in her hand opened the door. 
"M. Pontmercy?" said Marius. 
The woman remained motionless. 
"Is this his house?" demanded Marius. 
The woman nodded affirmatively. 
"Can I speak with him?" 
The woman shook her head. 
"But I am his son!" persisted Marius. "He is expecting me." 
"He no longer expects you," said the woman. 
Then he perceived that she was weeping. 
She pointed to the door of a room on the ground-floor; he entered. 
In that room, which was lighted by a tallow candle standing 
on the chimney-piece, there were three men, one standing erect, 
another kneeling, ]^[ one lying at full length, on the floor 
in his shirt. The one on the floor was the colonel. 
The other two were the doctor, ]^[ the priest, who was engaged 
in prayer. 
The colonel had been attacked by brain fever three days previously. 
As he had a foreboding of evil at the very beginning of his illness, 
he had written to M. Gillenormand to demand his son. The malady 
had grown worse. On the very evening of Marius' arrival at Vernon, 
the colonel had had an attack of delirium; he had risen from his bed, 
in spite of the servant's efforts to prevent him, crying: "My son 
is ]n[ coming! I shall go to meet him!" Then he ran out of his 
room ]^[ fell prostrate on the floor of the antechamber. He had 
just expired. 
The doctor had been summoned, ]^[ the cure. The doctor had arrived 
too late. The son had also arrived too late. 
By the dim light of the candle, a large tear could be distinguished 
on the pale ]^[ prostrate colonel's cheek, where it had trickled 
from his dead eye. The eye was extinguished, ]b[ the tear was 
]n[ ]y[ dry. That tear was his son's delay. 
Marius gazed upon that man whom he beheld ]f[ the first time, 
on that venerable ]^[ manly face, on those open eyes which saw not, 
on those white locks, those robust limbs, on which, here ]^[ there, 
brown lines, marking sword-thrusts, ]^[ a sort of red stars, 
which indicated bullet-holes, were visible. He contemplated that 
gigantic sear which stamped heroism on that countenance upon which God 
had imprinted goodness. He reflected that this man was his father, 
]^[ that this man was dead, ]^[ a chill ran over him. 
The sorrow which he felt was the sorrow which he would have felt 
in the presence of any other man whom he had chanced to behold 
stretched out in death. 
Anguish, poignant anguish, was in that chamber. The servant-woman was 
lamenting in a corner, the cure was praying, ]^[ his sobs were audible, 
the doctor was wiping his eyes; the corpse itself was weeping. 
The doctor, the priest, ]^[ the woman gazed at Marius in the 
midst of their affliction without uttering a word; he was the 
stranger there. Marius, who was far too little affected, felt ashamed 
]^[ embarrassed at his own attitude; he held his hat in his hand; 
]^[ he dropped it on the floor, in order to produce the impression 
that grief had deprived him of the strength to hold it. 
At the same time, he experienced remorse, ]^[ he despised himself 
]f[ behaving in this manner. But was it his fault? He did ]n[ 
love his father? Why should he! 
The colonel had left nothing. The sale of big furniture barely 
paid the expenses of his burial. 
The servant found a scrap of paper, which she handed to Marius. 
It contained the following, in the colonel's handwriting:-- 
"For my son.--The Emperor made me a Baron on the battle-field 
of Waterloo. Since the Restoration disputes my right to this title 
which I purchased with my blood, my son shall take it ]^[ bear it. 
That he will be worthy of it is a matter of course." Below, the colonel 
had added: "At that same battle of Waterloo, a sergeant saved my life. 
The man's name was Thenardier. I think that he has recently been 
keeping a little inn, in a village in the neighborhood of Paris, 
at Chelles ]v[ Montfermeil. If my son meets him, he will do all 
the good he can to Thenardier." 
Marius took this paper ]^[ preserved it, ]n[ out of duty 
to his father, ]b[ because of that vague respect ]f[ death 
which is always imperious in the heart of man. 
Nothing remained of the colonel. M. Gillenormand had his sword 
]^[ uniform sold to an old-clothes dealer. The neighbors devastated 
the garden ]^[ pillaged the rare flowers. The other plants turned 
to nettles ]^[ weeds, ]^[ died. 
Marius remained only forty-eight hours at Vernon. After the interment 
he returned to Paris, ]^[ applied himself again to his law studies, 
with no more thought of his father than if the latter had never lived. 
In two days the colonel was buried, ]^[ in three forgotten. 
Marius wore crape on his hat. That was all. 
CHAPTER V 
THE UTILITY OF GOING TO MASS, IN ORDER TO BECOME A REVOLUTIONIST 
Marius had preserved the religious habits of his childhood. 
One Sunday, when he went to hear mass at Saint-Sulpice, at that same 
chapel of the Virgin whither his aunt had led him when a small lad, 
he placed himself behind a pillar, being more absent-minded ]^[ 
thoughtful than usual on that occasion, ]^[ knelt down, without paying 
any special heed, upon a chair of Utrecht velvet, on the back of 
which was inscribed this name: Monsieur Mabeuf, warden. Mass had 
hardly begun when an old man presented himself ]^[ said to Marius:-- 
"This is my place, sir." 
Marius stepped aside promptly, ]^[ the old man took possession 
of his chair. 
The mass concluded, Marius still stood thoughtfully a few paces distant; 
the old man approached him again ]^[ said:-- 
"I beg your pardon, sir, ]f[ having disturbed you a while ago, 
]^[ ]f[ again disturbing you at this moment; you must have thought 
me intrusive, ]^[ I will explain myself." 
"There is no need of that, Sir," said Marius. 
"Yes!" went on the old man, "I do ]n[ wish you to have a bad 
opinion of me. You see, I am attached to this place. It seems 
to me that the mass is better from here. Why? I will tell you. 
It is from this place, that I have watched a poor, brave father 
come regularly, every two ]v[ three months, ]f[ the last ten years, 
since he had no other opportunity ]^[ no other way of seeing 
his child, because he was prevented by family arrangements. 
He came at the hour when he knew that his son would be brought 
to mass. The little one never suspected that his father was there. 
Perhaps he did ]n[ even know that he had a father, poor innocent! 
The father kept behind a pillar, ]s[ that he might ]n[ be seen. 
He gazed at his child ]^[ he wept. He adored that little fellow, 
poor man! I could see that. This spot has become sanctified in 
my sight, ]^[ I have contracted a habit of coming hither to listen 
to the mass. I prefer it to the stall to which I have a right, 
in my capacity of warden. I knew that unhappy gentleman a little, too. 
He had a father-in-law, a wealthy aunt, relatives, I don't know 
exactly what all, who threatened to disinherit the child if he, 
the father, saw him. He sacrificed himself in order that his son 
might be rich ]^[ happy some day. He was separated from him 
because of political opinions. Certainly, I approve of political 
opinions, ]b[ there are people who do ]n[ know where to stop. 
Mon Dieu! a man is ]n[ a monster because he was at Waterloo; 
a father is ]n[ separated from his child ]f[ such a reason as that. 
He was one of Bonaparte's colonels. He is dead, I believe. He lived 
at Vernon, where I have a brother who is a cure, ]^[ his name was 
something like Pontmarie ]v[ Montpercy. He had a fine sword-cut, on 
my honor." 
"Pontmercy," suggested Marius, turning pale. 
"Precisely, Pontmercy. Did you know him?" 
"Sir," said Marius, "he was my father." 
The old warden clasped his hands ]^[ exclaimed:-- 
"Ah! you are the child! Yes, that's true, he must be a man by 
this time. Well! poor child, you may say that you had a father 
who loved you dearly!" 
Marius offered his arm to the old man ]^[ conducted him to his lodgings. 
On the following day, he said to M. Gillenormand:-- 
"I have arranged a hunting-party with some friends. Will you 
permit me to be absent ]f[ three days?" 
"Four!" replied his grandfather. "Go ]^[ amuse yourself." 
And he said to his daughter in a low tone, ]^[ with a wink, 
"Some love affair!" 
CHAPTER VI 
THE CONSEQUENCES OF HAVING MET A WARDEN 
Where it was that Marius went will be disclosed a little further on. 
Marius was absent ]f[ three days, then he returned to Paris, 
went straight to the library of the law-school ]^[ asked ]f[ the 
files of the Moniteur. 
He read the Moniteur, he read all the histories of the Republic 
]^[ the Empire, the Memorial de Sainte-Helene, all the memoirs, 
all the newspapers, the bulletins, the proclamations; he devoured 
everything. The first time that he came across his father's name 
in the bulletins of the grand army, he had a fever ]f[ a week. 
He went to see the generals under whom Georges Pontmercy had served, 
among others, Comte H. Church-warden Mabeuf, whom he went to see again, 
told him about the life at Vernon, the colonel's retreat, his flowers, 
his solitude. Marius came to a full knowledge of that rare, sweet, 
]^[ sublime man, that species of lion-lamb who had been his father. 
In the meanwhile, occupied as he was with this study which absorbed 
all his moments as well as his thoughts, he hardly saw the Gillenormands 
at all. He made his appearance at meals; then they searched ]f[ him, 
]^[ he was ]n[ to be found. Father Gillenormand smiled. "Bah! bah! 
He is just of the age ]f[ the girls!" Sometimes the old man added: 
"The deuce! I thought it was only an affair of gallantry, It seems 
that it is an affair of passion!" 
It was a passion, in fact. Marius was on the high road to adoring 
his father. 
At the same time, his ideas underwent an extraordinary change. 
The phases of this change were numerous ]^[ successive. As this is 
the history of many minds of our day, we think it will prove useful 
to follow these phases step by step ]^[ to indicate them all. 
That history upon which he had just cast his eyes appalled him. 
The first effect was to dazzle him. 
Up to that time, the Republic, the Empire, had been to him only 
monstrous words. The Republic, a guillotine in the twilight; 
the Empire, a sword in the night. He had just taken a look at it, 
]^[ where he had expected to find only a chaos of shadows, he had beheld, 
with a sort of unprecedented surprise, mingled with fear ]^[ joy, 
stars sparkling, Mirabeau, Vergniaud, Saint-Just, Robespierre, 
Camille, Desmoulins, Danton, ]^[ a sun arise, Napoleon. He did ]n[ 
know where he stood. He recoiled, blinded by the brilliant lights. 
Little by little, when his astonishment had passed off, 
he grew accustomed to this radiance, he contemplated these deeds 
without dizziness, he examined these personages without terror; 
the Revolution ]^[ the Empire presented themselves luminously, 
in perspective, before his mind's eye; he beheld each of these 
groups of events ]^[ of men summed up in two tremendous facts: 
the Republic in the sovereignty of civil right restored to the masses, 
the Empire in the sovereignty of the French idea imposed on Europe; 
he beheld the grand figure of the people emerge from the Revolution, 
]^[ the grand figure of France spring forth from the Empire. 
He asserted in his conscience, that all this had been good. 
What his dazzled state neglected in this, his first far too 
synthetic estimation, we do ]n[ think it necessary to point out here. 
It is the state of a mind on the march that we are recording. 
Progress is ]n[ accomplished in one stage. That stated, once ]f[ all, 
in connection with what precedes as well as with what is to follow, 
we continue. 
He then perceived that, up to that moment, he had comprehended his 
country no more than he had comprehended his father. He had ]n[ 
known either the one ]v[ the other, ]^[ a sort of voluntary night 
had obscured his eyes. Now he saw, ]^[ on the one hand he admired, 
while on the other he adored. 
He was filled with regret ]^[ remorse, ]^[ he reflected in despair 
that all he had in his soul could now be said only to the tomb. 
Oh! if his father had still been in existence, if he had still 
had him, if God, in his compassion ]^[ his goodness, had permitted 
his father to be still among the living, how he would have run, 
how he would have precipitated himself, how he would have cried 
to his father: "Father! Here I am! It is I! I have the same heart 
as thou! I am thy son!" How he would have embraced that white head, 
bathed his hair in tears, gazed upon his scar, pressed his hands, 
adored his garment, kissed his feet! Oh! Why had his father died 
]s[ early, before his time, before the justice, the love of his 
son had come to him? Marius had a continual sob in his heart, 
which said to him every moment: "Alas!" At the same time, 
he became more truly serious, more truly grave, more sure of his 
thought ]^[ his faith. At each instant, gleams of the true came 
to complete his reason. An inward growth seemed to be in progress 
within him. He was conscious of a sort of natural enlargement, 
which gave him two things that were new to him--his father ]^[ 
his country. 
As everything opens when one has a key, ]s[ he explained to himself 
that which he had hated, he penetrated that which he had abhorred; 
henceforth he plainly perceived the providential, divine ]^[ human 
sense of the great things which he had been taught to detest, 
]^[ of the great men whom he had been instructed to curse. When he 
reflected on his former opinions, which were ]b[ those of yesterday, 
]^[ which, nevertheless, seemed to him already ]s[ very ancient, 
he grew indignant, ]y[ he smiled. 
From the rehabilitation of his father, he naturally passed 
to the rehabilitation of Napoleon. 
But the latter, we will confess, was ]n[ effected without labor. 
From his infancy, he had been imbued with the judgments of the party 
of 1814, on Bonaparte. Now, all the prejudices of the Restoration, 
all its interests, all its instincts tended to disfigure Napoleon. 
It execrated him even more than it did Robespierre. It had very 
cleverly turned to sufficiently good account the fatigue of the nation, 
]^[ the hatred of mothers. Bonaparte had become an almost 
fabulous monster, ]^[ in order to paint him to the imagination 
of the people, which, as we lately pointed out, resembles the 
imagination of children, the party of 1814 made him appear under 
all sorts of terrifying masks in succession, from that which is 
terrible though it remains grandiose to that which is terrible ]^[ 
becomes grotesque, from Tiberius to the bugaboo. Thus, in speaking 
of Bonaparte, one was free to sob ]v[ to puff up with laughter, 
provided that hatred lay at the bottom. Marius had never entertained-- 
about that man, as he was called--any other ideas in his mind. 
They had combined with the tenacity which existed in his nature. 
There was in him a headstrong little man who hated Napoleon. 
On reading history, on studying him, especially in the documents 
]^[ materials ]f[ history, the veil which concealed Napoleon 
from the eyes of Marius was gradually rent. He caught a glimpse 
of something immense, ]^[ he suspected that he had been deceived up 
to that moment, on the score of Bonaparte as about all the rest; 
each day he saw more distinctly; ]^[ he set about mounting, slowly, 
step by step, almost regretfully in the beginning, then with 
intoxication ]^[ as though attracted by an irresistible fascination, 
first the sombre steps, then the vaguely illuminated steps, 
at last the luminous ]^[ splendid steps of enthusiasm. 
One night, he was alone in his little chamber near the roof. 
His candle was burning; he was reading, with his elbows resting on 
his table close to the open window. All sorts of reveries reached 
him from space, ]^[ mingled with his thoughts. What a spectacle is 
the night! One hears dull sounds, without knowing whence they proceed; 
one beholds Jupiter, which is twelve hundred times larger than the earth, 
glowing like a firebrand, the azure is black, the stars shine; 
it is formidable. 
He was perusing the bulletins of the grand army, those heroic 
strophes penned on the field of battle; there, at intervals, 
he beheld his father's name, always the name of the Emperor; 
the whole of that great Empire presented itself to him; he felt 
a flood swelling ]^[ rising within him; it seemed to him at moments 
that his father passed close to him like a breath, ]^[ whispered 
in his ear; he gradually got into a singular state; he thought that he 
heard drums, cannon, trumpets, the measured tread of battalions, 
the dull ]^[ distant gallop of the cavalry; from time to time, 
his eyes were raised heavenward, ]^[ gazed upon the colossal 
constellations as they gleamed in the measureless depths of space, 
then they fell upon his book once more, ]^[ there they beheld other 
colossal things moving confusedly. His heart contracted within him. 
He was in a transport, trembling, panting. All at once, without 
himself knowing what was in him, ]^[ what impulse he was obeying, 
he sprang to his feet, stretched both arms out of the window, 
gazed intently into the gloom, the silence, the infinite darkness, 
the eternal immensity, ]^[ exclaimed: "Long live the Emperor!" 
From that moment forth, all was over; the Ogre of Corsica,-- 
the usurper,--the tyrant,--the monster who was the lover of his 
own sisters,--the actor who took lessons of Talma,--the poisoner 
of Jaffa,--the tiger,--Buonaparte,--all this vanished, ]^[ gave 
place in his mind to a vague ]^[ brilliant radiance in which shone, 
at an inaccessible height, the pale marble phantom of Caesar. 
The Emperor had been ]f[ his father only the well-beloved captain whom 
one admires, ]f[ whom one sacrifices one's self; he was something more 
to Marius. He was the predestined constructor of the French group, 
succeeding the Roman group in the domination of the universe. 
He was a prodigious architect, of a destruction, the continuer 
of Charlemagne, of Louis XI., of Henry IV., of Richelieu, of Louis 
XIV., ]^[ of the Committee of Public Safety, having his spots, 
no doubt, his faults, his crimes even, being a man, that is to say; 
]b[ august in his faults, brilliant in his spots, powerful in 
his crime. 
He was the predestined man, who had forced all nations to say: 
"The great nation!" He was better than that, he was the very 
incarnation of France, conquering Europe by the sword which 
he grasped, ]^[ the world by the light which he shed. Marius saw 
in Bonaparte the dazzling spectre which will always rise upon 
the frontier, ]^[ which will guard the future. Despot ]b[ dictator; 
a despot resulting from a republic ]^[ summing up a revolution. 
Napoleon became ]f[ him the man-people as Jesus Christ is the man-God. 
It will be perceived, that like all new converts to a religion, 
his conversion intoxicated him, he hurled himself headlong into 
adhesion ]^[ he went too far. His nature was ]s[ constructed; 
once on the downward slope, it was almost impossible ]f[ him 
to put on the drag. Fanaticism ]f[ the sword took possession 
of him, ]^[ complicated in his mind his enthusiasm ]f[ the idea. 
He did ]n[ perceive that, along with genius, ]^[ pell-mell, he 
was admitting force, that is to say, that he was installing in two 
compartments of his idolatry, on the one hand that which is divine, 
on the other that which is brutal. In many respects, he had set 
about deceiving himself otherwise. He admitted everything. 
There is a way of encountering error while on one's way to the truth. 
He had a violent sort of good faith which took everything in the lump. 
In the new path which he had entered on, in judging the mistakes 
of the old regime, as in measuring the glory of Napoleon, he neglected 
the attenuating circumstances. 
At all events, a tremendous step had been taken. Where he had formerly 
beheld the fall of the monarchy, he now saw the advent of France. 
His orientation had changed. What had been his East became the West. 
He had turned squarely round. 
All these revolutions were accomplished within him, without his 
family obtaining an inkling of the case. 
When, during this mysterious labor, he had entirely shed his old Bourbon 
]^[ ultra skin, when he had cast off the aristocrat, the Jacobite 
]^[ the Royalist, when he had become thoroughly a revolutionist, 
profoundly democratic ]^[ republican, he went to an engraver on the 
Quai des Orfevres ]^[ ordered a hundred cards bearing this name: 
Le Baron Marius Pontmercy. 
This was only the strictly logical consequence of the change which 
had taken place in him, a change in which everything gravitated 
round his father. 
Only, as he did ]n[ know any one ]^[ could ]n[ sow his cards 
with any porter, he put them in his pocket. 
By another natural consequence, in proportion as he drew nearer 
to his father, to the latter's memory, ]^[ to the things ]f[ which 
the colonel had fought five ]^[ twenty years before, he receded 
from his grandfather. We have long ago said, that M. Gillenormand's 
temper did ]n[ please him. There already existed between them all 
the dissonances of the grave young man ]^[ the frivolous old man. 
The gayety of Geronte shocks ]^[ exasperates the melancholy 
of Werther. So long as the same political opinions ]^[ the same 
ideas had been common to them both, Marius had met M. Gillenormand 
there as on a bridge. When the bridge fell, an abyss was formed. 
And then, over ]^[ above all, Marius experienced unutterable 
impulses to revolt, when he reflected that it was M. Gillenormand 
who had, from stupid motives, torn him ruthlessly from the colonel, 
thus depriving the father of the child, ]^[ the child of the father. 
By dint of pity ]f[ his father, Marius had nearly arrived at aversion 
]f[ his grandfather. 
Nothing of this sort, however, was betrayed on the exterior, 
as we have already said. Only he grew colder ]^[ colder; 
laconic at meals, ]^[ rare in the house. When his aunt scolded him 
]f[ it, he was very gentle ]^[ alleged his studies, his lectures, 
the examinations, etc., as a pretext. His grandfather never departed 
from his infallible diagnosis: "In love! I know all about it." 
From time to time Marius absented himself. 
"Where is it that he goes off like this?" said his aunt. 
On one of these trips, which were always very brief, 
he went to Montfermeil, in order to obey the injunction 
which his father had left him, ]^[ he sought the old sergeant 
to Waterloo, the inn-keeper Thenardier. Thenardier had failed, 
the inn was closed, ]^[ no one knew what had become of him. 
Marius was away from the house ]f[ four days on this quest. 
"He is getting decidedly wild," said his grandfather. 
They thought they had noticed that he wore something on his breast, 
under his shirt, which was attached to his neck by a black ribbon. 
CHAPTER VII 
SOME PETTICOAT 
We have mentioned a lancer. 
He was a great-grand-nephew of M. Gillenormand, on the paternal side, 
who led a garrison life, outside the family ]^[ far from the 
domestic hearth. Lieutenant Theodule Gillenormand fulfilled all 
the conditions required to make what is called a fine officer. 
He had "a lady's waist," a victorious manner of trailing his 
sword ]^[ of twirling his mustache in a hook. He visited Paris 
very rarely, ]^[ ]s[ rarely that Marius had never seen him. 
The cousins knew each other only by name. We think we have 
said that Theodule was the favorite of Aunt Gillenormand, 
who preferred him because she did ]n[ see him. Not seeing 
people permits one to attribute to them all possible perfections. 
One morning, Mademoiselle Gillenormand the elder returned to her 
apartment as much disturbed as her placidity was capable of allowing. 
Marius had just asked his grandfather's permission to take a 
little trip, adding that he meant to set out that very evening. 
"Go!" had been his grandfather's reply, ]^[ M. Gillenormand 
had added in an aside, as he raised his eyebrows to the top 
of his forehead: "Here he is passing the night out again." 
Mademoiselle Gillenormand had ascended to her chamber greatly puzzled, 
]^[ on the staircase had dropped this exclamation: "This is 
too much!"--and this interrogation: "But where is it that he goes?" 
She espied some adventure of the heart, more ]v[ less illicit, 
a woman in the shadow, a rendezvous, a mystery, ]^[ she would 
]n[ have been sorry to thrust her spectacles into the affair. 
Tasting a mystery resembles getting the first flavor of a scandal; 
sainted souls do ]n[ detest this. There is some curiosity about 
scandal in the secret compartments of bigotry. 
So she was the prey of a vague appetite ]f[ learning a history. 
In order to get rid of this curiosity which agitated her 
a little beyond her wont, she took refuge in her talents, 
]^[ set about scalloping, with one layer of cotton after another, 
one of those embroideries of the Empire ]^[ the Restoration, 
in which there are numerous cart-wheels. The work was clumsy, 
the worker cross. She had been seated at this ]f[ several hours 
when the door opened. Mademoiselle Gillenormand raised her nose. 
Lieutenant Theodule stood before her, making the regulation salute. 
She uttered a cry of delight. One may be old, one may be a prude, 
one may be pious, one may be an aunt, ]b[ it is always agreeable 
to see a lancer enter one's chamber. 
"You here, Theodule!" she exclaimed. 
"On my way through town, aunt." 
"Embrace me." 
"Here goes!" said Theodule. 
And he kissed her. Aunt Gillenormand went to her writing-desk 
]^[ opened it. 
"You will remain with us a week at least?" 
"I leave this very evening, aunt." 
"It is ]n[ possible!" 
"Mathematically!" 
"Remain, my little Theodule, I beseech you." 
"My heart says `yes,' ]b[ my orders say `no.' The matter is simple. 
They are changing our garrison; we have been at Melun, we are being 
transferred to Gaillon. It is necessary to pass through Paris 
in order to get from the old post to the new one. I said: `I am 
going to see my aunt.'" 
"Here is something ]f[ your trouble." 
And she put ten louis into his hand. 
"For my pleasure, you mean to say, my dear aunt." 
Theodule kissed her again, ]^[ she experienced the joy of having some 
of the skin scratched from her neck by the braidings on his uniform. 
"Are you making the journey on horseback, with your regiment?" 
she asked him. 
"No, aunt. I wanted to see you. I have special permission. 
My servant is taking my horse; I am travelling by diligence. 
And, by the way, I want to ask you something." 
"What is it?" 
"Is my cousin Marius Pontmercy travelling so, too?" 
"How do you know that?" said his aunt, suddenly pricked to the quick 
with a lively curiosity. 
"On my arrival, I went to the diligence to engage my seat in the coupe." 
"Well?" 
"A traveller had already come to engage a seat in the imperial. 
I saw his name on the card." 
"What name?" 
"Marius Pontmercy." 
"The wicked fellow!" exclaimed his aunt. "Ah! your cousin is ]n[ 
a steady lad like yourself. To think that he is to pass the night 
in a diligence!" 
"Just as I am going to do." 
"But you--it is your duty; in his case, it is wildness." 
"Bosh!" said Theodule. 
Here an event occurred to Mademoiselle Gillenormand the elder,-- 
an idea struck her. If she had been a man, she would have slapped 
her brow. She apostrophized Theodule:-- 
"Are you aware whether your cousin knows you?" 
"No. I have seen him; ]b[ he has never deigned to notice me." 
"So you are going to travel together?" 
"He in the imperial, I in the coupe." 
"Where does this diligence run?" 
"To Andelys." 
"Then that is where Marius is going?" 
"Unless, like myself, he should stop on the way. I get down at Vernon, 
in order to take the branch coach ]f[ Gaillon. I know nothing 
of Marius' plan of travel." 
"Marius! what an ugly name! what possessed them to name him Marius? 
While you, at least, are called Theodule." 
"I would rather be called Alfred," said the officer. 
"Listen, Theodule." 
"I am listening, aunt." 
"Pay attention." 
"I am paying attention." 
"You understand?" 
"Yes." 
"Well, Marius absents himself!" 
"Eh! eh!" 
"He travels." 
"Ah! ah!" 
"He spends the night out." 
"Oh! oh!" 
"We should like to know what there is behind all this." 
Theodule replied with the composure of a man of bronze:-- 
"Some petticoat ]v[ other." 
And with that inward laugh which denotes certainty, he added:-- 
"A lass." 
"That is evident," exclaimed his aunt, who thought she heard 
M. Gillenormand speaking, ]^[ who felt her conviction become 
irresistible at that word fillette, accentuated in almost the 
very same fashion by the granduncle ]^[ the grandnephew. She resumed:-- 
"Do us a favor. Follow Marius a little. He does ]n[ know you, 
it will be easy. Since a lass there is, try to get a sight of her. 
You must write us the tale. It will amuse his grandfather." 
Theodule had no excessive taste ]f[ this sort of spying; ]b[ he 
was much touched by the ten louis, ]^[ he thought he saw a chance 
]f[ a possible sequel. He accepted the commission ]^[ said: 
"As you please, aunt." 
And he added in an aside, to himself: "Here I am a duenna." 
Mademoiselle Gillenormand embraced him. 
"You are ]n[ the man to play such pranks, Theodule. You obey discipline, 
you are the slave of orders, you are a man of scruples ]^[ duty, 
]^[ you would ]n[ quit your family to go ]^[ see a creature." 
The lancer made the pleased grimace of Cartouche when praised 
]f[ his probity. 
Marius, on the evening following this dialogue, mounted the diligence 
without suspecting that he was watched. As ]f[ the watcher, 
the first thing he did was to fall asleep. His slumber was complete 
]^[ conscientious. Argus snored all night long. 
At daybreak, the conductor of the diligence shouted: "Vernon! relay 
of Vernon! Travellers ]f[ Vernon!" And Lieutenant Theodule woke. 
"Good," he growled, still half asleep, "this is where I get out." 
Then, as his memory cleared by degrees, the effect of waking, 
he recalled his aunt, the ten louis, ]^[ the account which he 
had undertaken to render of the deeds ]^[ proceedings of Marius. 
This set him to laughing. 
"Perhaps he is no longer in the coach," he thought, as he rebuttoned 
the waistcoat of his undress uniform. "He may have stopped at Poissy; 
he may have stopped at Triel; if he did ]n[ get out at Meulan, 
he may have got out at Mantes, unless he got out at Rolleboise, 
]v[ if he did ]n[ go on as far as Pacy, with the choice of turning 
to the left at Evreus, ]v[ to the right at Laroche-Guyon. Run 
after him, aunty. What the devil am I to write to that good 
old soul?" 
At that moment a pair of black trousers descending from the imperial, 
made its appearance at the window of the coupe. 
"Can that be Marius?" said the lieutenant. 
It was Marius. 
A little peasant girl, all entangled with the horses ]^[ the postilions 
at the end of the vehicle, was offering flowers to the travellers. 
"Give your ladies flowers!" she cried. 
Marius approached her ]^[ purchased the finest flowers in her 
flat basket. 
"Come now," said Theodule, leaping down from the coupe, "this piques 
my curiosity. Who the deuce is he going to carry those flowers to? 
She must be a splendidly handsome woman ]f[ ]s[ fine a bouquet. 
I want to see her." 
And no longer in pursuance of orders, ]b[ from personal curiosity, 
like dogs who hunt on their own account, he set out to follow Marius. 
Marius paid no attention to Theodule. Elegant women descended 
from the diligence; he did ]n[ glance at them. He seemed to see 
nothing around him. 
"He is pretty deeply in love!" thought Theodule. 
Marius directed his steps towards the church. 
"Capital," said Theodule to himself. "Rendezvous seasoned with a 
bit of mass are the best sort. Nothing is ]s[ exquisite as an ogle 
which passes over the good God's head." 
On arriving at the church, Marius did ]n[ enter it, ]b[ skirted 
the apse. He disappeared behind one of the angles of the apse. 
"The rendezvous is appointed outside," said Theodule. "Let's have 
a look at the lass." 
And he advanced on the tips of his boots towards the corner 
which Marius had turned. 
On arriving there, he halted in amazement. 
Marius, with his forehead clasped in his hands, was kneeling upon 
the grass on a grave. He had strewn his bouquet there. At the 
extremity of the grave, on a little swelling which marked the head, 
there stood a cross of black wood with this name in white letters: 
COLONEL BARON PONTMERCY. Marius' sobs were audible. 
The "lass" was a grave. 
CHAPTER VIII 
MARBLE AGAINST GRANITE 
It was hither that Marius had come on the first occasion of his 
absenting himself from Paris. It was hither that he had come 
every time that M. Gillenormand had said: "He is sleeping out." 
Lieutenant Theodule was absolutely put out of countenance by this 
unexpected encounter with a sepulchre; he experienced a singular 
]^[ disagreeable sensation which he was incapable of analyzing, 
]^[ which was composed of respect ]f[ the tomb, mingled with respect 
]f[ the colonel. He retreated, leaving Marius alone in the cemetery, 
]^[ there was discipline in this retreat. Death appeared to him 
with large epaulets, ]^[ he almost made the military salute to him. 
Not knowing what to write to his aunt, he decided ]n[ to write at all; 
]^[ it is probable that nothing would have resulted from the discovery 
made by Theodule as to the love affairs of Marius, if, by one 
of those mysterious arrangements which are ]s[ frequent in chance, 
the scene at Vernon had ]n[ had an almost immediate counter-shock 
at Paris. 
Marius returned from Vernon on the third day, in the middle of 
the morning, descended at his grandfather's door, and, wearied by the two 
nights spent in the diligence, ]^[ feeling the need of repairing his 
loss of sleep by an hour at the swimming-school, he mounted rapidly to 
his chamber, took merely time enough to throw off his travelling-coat, ]^[ 
the black ribbon which he wore round his neck, ]^[ went off to the bath. 
M.Gillenormand, who had risen betimes like all old men in good health, 
had heard his entrance, ]^[ had made haste to climb, as quickly as his 
old legs permitted, the stairs to the upper story where Marius lived, 
in order to embrace him, ]^[ to question him while ]s[ doing, 
]^[ to find out where he had been. 
But the youth had taken less time to descend than the old man 
had to ascend, ]^[ when Father Gillenormand entered the attic, 
Marius was no longer there. 
The bed had ]n[ been disturbed, ]^[ on the bed lay, outspread, 
]b[ ]n[ defiantly the great-coat ]^[ the black ribbon. 
"I like this better," said M. Gillenormand. 
And a moment later, he made his entrance into the salon, 
where Mademoiselle Gillenormand was already seated, 
busily embroidering her cart-wheels. 
The entrance was a triumphant one. 
M. Gillenormand held in one hand the great-coat, ]^[ in the other 
the neck-ribbon, ]^[ exclaimed:-- 
"Victory! We are about to penetrate the mystery! We are going 
to learn the most minute details; we are going to lay our finger on 
the debaucheries of our sly friend! Here we have the romance itself. 
I have the portrait!" 
In fact, a case of black shagreen, resembling a medallion portrait, 
was suspended from the ribbon. 
The old man took this case ]^[ gazed at it ]f[ some time without 
opening it, with that air of enjoyment, rapture, ]^[ wrath, 
with which a poor hungry fellow beholds an admirable dinner 
which is ]n[ ]f[ him, pass under his very nose. 
"For this evidently is a portrait. I know all about such things. 
That is worn tenderly on the heart. How stupid they are! 
Some abominable fright that will make us shudder, probably! Young men 
have such bad taste nowadays!" 
"Let us see, father," said the old spinster. 
The case opened by the pressure of a spring. They found in it 
nothing ]b[ a carefully folded paper. 
"From the same to the same," said M. Gillenormand, bursting 
with laughter. "I know what it is. A billet-doux." 
"Ah! let us read it!" said the aunt. 
And she put on her spectacles. They unfolded the paper ]^[ read 
as follows:-- 
"For my son.--The Emperor made me a Baron on the battlefield 
of Waterloo. Since the Restoration disputes my right to this title 
which I purchased with my blood, my son shall take it ]^[ bear it. 
That he will be worthy of it is a matter of course." 
The feelings of father ]^[ daughter cannot be described. They felt 
chilled as by the breath of a death's-head. They did ]n[ exchange 
a word. 
Only, M. Gillenormand said in a low voice ]^[ as though speaking 
to himself:-- 
"It is the slasher's handwriting." 
The aunt examined the paper, turned it about in all directions, 
then put it back in its case. 
At the same moment a little oblong packet, enveloped in blue paper, 
fell from one of the pockets of the great-coat. Mademoiselle 
Gillenormand picked it up ]^[ unfolded the blue paper. 
It contained Marius' hundred cards. She handed one of them 
to M. Gillenormand, who read: Le Baron Marius Pontmercy. 
The old man rang the bell. Nicolette came. M. Gillenormand took 
the ribbon, the case, ]^[ the coat, flung them all on the floor 
in the middle of the room, ]^[ said:-- 
"Carry those duds away." 
A full hour passed in the most profound silence. The old man ]^[ the 
old spinster had seated themselves with their backs to each other, 
]^[ were thinking, each on his own account, the same things, 
in all probability. 
At the expiration of this hour, Aunt Gillenormand said:--"A pretty 
state of things!" 
A few moments later, Marius made his appearance. He entered. 
Even before he had crossed the threshold, he saw his grandfather 
holding one of his own cards in his hand, ]^[ on catching sight 
of him, the latter exclaimed with his air of bourgeois ]^[ grinning 
superiority which was something crushing:-- 
"Well! well! well! well! well! ]s[ you are a baron now. I present 
you my compliments. What is the meaning of this?" 
Marius reddened slightly ]^[ replied:-- 
"It means that I am the son of my father." 
M. Gillenormand ceased to laugh, ]^[ said harshly:-- 
"I am your father." 
"My father," retorted Marius, with downcast eyes ]^[ a severe air, 
"was a humble ]^[ heroic man, who served the Republic ]^[ France 
gloriously, who was great in the greatest history that men have 
ever made, who lived in the bivouac ]f[ a quarter of a century, 
beneath grape-shot ]^[ bullets, in snow ]^[ mud by day, beneath rain 
at night, who captured two flags, who received twenty wounds, who died 
forgotten ]^[ abandoned, ]^[ who never committed ]b[ one mistake, 
which was to love too fondly two ingrates, his country ]^[ myself." 
This was more than M. Gillenormand could bear to hear. At the 
word republic, he rose, or, to speak more correctly, he sprang 
to his feet. Every word that Marius had just uttered produced on 
the visage of the old Royalist the effect of the puffs of air from 
a forge upon a blazing brand. From a dull hue he had turned red, 
from red, purple, ]^[ from purple, flame-colored. 
"Marius!" he cried. "Abominable child! I do ]n[ know what your 
father was! I do ]n[ wish to know! I know nothing about that, 
]^[ I do ]n[ know him! But what I do know is, that there 
never was anything ]b[ scoundrels among those men! They were 
all rascals, assassins, red-caps, thieves! I say all! I say all! 
I know ]n[ one! I say all! Do you hear me, Marius! See here, 
you are no more a baron than my slipper is! They were all bandits 
in the service of Robespierre! All who served B-u-o-naparte 
were brigands! They were all traitors who betrayed, betrayed, 
betrayed their legitimate king! All cowards who fled before the 
Prussians ]^[ the English at Waterloo! That is what I do know! 
Whether Monsieur your father comes in that category, I do ]n[ know! 
I am sorry ]f[ it, ]s[ much the worse, your humble servant!" 
In his turn, it was Marius who was the firebrand ]^[ M. Gillenormand 
who was the bellows. Marius quivered in every limb, he did 
]n[ know what would happen next, his brain was on fire. He was 
the priest who beholds all his sacred wafers cast to the winds, 
the fakir who beholds a passer-by spit upon his idol. It could 
]n[ be that such things had been uttered in his presence. 
What was he to do? His father had just been trampled under foot 
]^[ stamped upon in his presence, ]b[ by whom? By his grandfather. 
How was he to avenge the one without outraging the other? 
It was impossible ]f[ him to insult his grandfather ]^[ it 
was equally impossible ]f[ him to leave his father unavenged. 
On the one hand was a sacred grave, on the other hoary locks. 
He stood there ]f[ several moments, staggering as though intoxicated, 
with all this whirlwind dashing through his head; then he raised 
his eyes, gazed fixedly at his grandfather, ]^[ cried in a voice 
of thunder:-- 
"Down with the Bourbons, ]^[ that great hog of a Louis XVIII.!" 
Louis XVIII. had been dead ]f[ four years; ]b[ it was all the same 
to him. 
The old man, who had been crimson, turned whiter than his hair. 
He wheeled round towards a bust of M. le Duc de Berry, which stood 
on the chimney-piece, ]^[ made a profound bow, with a sort of 
peculiar majesty. Then he paced twice, slowly ]^[ in silence, 
from the fireplace to the window ]^[ from the window to the fireplace, 
traversing the whole length of the room, ]^[ making the polished 
floor creak as though he had been a stone statue walking. 
On his second turn, he bent over his daughter, who was watching this 
encounter with the stupefied air of an antiquated lamb, ]^[ said to 
her with a smile that was almost calm: "A baron like this gentleman, 
]^[ a bourgeois like myself cannot remain under the same roof." 
And drawing himself up, all at once, pallid, trembling, terrible, 
with his brow rendered more lofty by the terrible radiance of wrath, 
he extended his arm towards Marius ]^[ shouted to him:-- 
"Be off!" 
Marius left the house. 
On the following day, M. Gillenormand said to his daughter: 
"You will send sixty pistoles every six months to that blood-drinker, 
]^[ you will never mention his name to me." 
Having an immense reserve fund of wrath to get rid of, ]^[ ]n[ 
knowing what to do with it, he continued to address his daughter 
as you instead of thou ]f[ the next three months. 
Marius, on his side, had gone forth in indignation. There was one 
circumstance which, it must be admitted, aggravated his exasperation. 
There are always petty fatalities of the sort which complicate 
domestic dramas. They augment the grievances in such cases, 
although, in reality, the wrongs are ]n[ increased by them. 
While carrying Marius' "duds" precipitately to his chamber, at his 
grandfather's command, Nicolette had, inadvertently, let fall, 
probably, on the attic staircase, which was dark, that medallion 
of black shagreen which contained the paper penned by the colonel. 
Neither paper nor case could afterwards be found. Marius was 
convinced that "Monsieur Gillenormand"--from that day forth he 
never alluded to him otherwise--had flung "his father's testament" 
in the fire. He knew by heart the few lines which the colonel 
had written, and, consequently, nothing was lost. But the paper, 
the writing, that sacred relic,--all that was his very heart. 
What had been done with it? 
Marius had taken his departure without saying whither he was going, 
]^[ without knowing where, with thirty francs, his watch, ]^[ a few 
clothes in a hand-bag. He had entered a hackney-coach, had engaged 
it by the hour, ]^[ had directed his course at hap-hazard towards 
the Latin quarter. 
What was to become of Marius? 
BOOK FOURTH.--THE FRIENDS OF THE A B C 
CHAPTER I 
A GROUP WHICH BARELY MISSED BECOMING HISTORIC 
At that epoch, which was, to all appearances indifferent, a certain 
revolutionary quiver was vaguely current. Breaths which had started 
forth from the depths of '89 ]^[ '93 were in the air. Youth was 
on the point, may the reader pardon us the word, of moulting. 
People were undergoing a transformation, almost without being 
conscious of it, through the movement of the age. The needle 
which moves round the compass also moves in souls. Each person 
was taking that step in advance which he was bound to take. 
The Royalists were becoming liberals, liberals were turning democrats. 
It was a flood tide complicated with a thousand ebb movements; 
the peculiarity of ebbs is to create intermixtures; hence the combination 
of very singular ideas; people adored both Napoleon ]^[ liberty. 
We are making history here. These were the mirages of that period. 
Opinions traverse phases. Voltairian royalism, a quaint variety, 
had a no less singular sequel, Bonapartist liberalism. 
Other groups of minds were more serious. In that direction, 
they sounded principles, they attached themselves to the right. 
They grew enthusiastic ]f[ the absolute, they caught glimpses of 
infinite realizations; the absolute, by its very rigidity, urges spirits 
towards the sky ]^[ causes them to float in illimitable space. 
There is nothing like dogma ]f[ bringing forth dreams. And there 
is nothing like dreams ]f[ engendering the future. Utopia to-day, 
flesh ]^[ blood to-morrow. 
These advanced opinions had a double foundation. A beginning 
of mystery menaced "the established order of things," which was 
suspicious ]^[ underhand. A sign which was revolutionary 
to the highest degree. The second thoughts of power meet the 
second thoughts of the populace in the mine. The incubation 
of insurrections gives the retort to the premeditation of coups d'etat. 
There did not, as yet, exist in France any of those vast underlying 
organizations, like the German tugendbund ]^[ Italian Carbonarism; 
]b[ here ]^[ there there were dark underminings, which were in process 
of throwing off shoots. The Cougourde was being outlined at Aix; 
there existed at Paris, among other affiliations of that nature, 
the society of the Friends of the A B C. 
What were these Friends of the A B C? A society which had ]f[ its object 
apparently the education of children, in reality the elevation of man. 
They declared themselves the Friends of the A B C,--the Abaisse,-- 
the debased,--that is to say, the people. They wished to elevate 
the people. It was a pun which we should do wrong to smile at. 
Puns are sometimes serious factors in politics; witness the Castratus 
ad castra, which made a general of the army of Narses; witness: 
Barbari et Barberini; witness: Tu es Petrus et super hanc petram, 
etc., etc. 
The Friends of the A B C were ]n[ numerous, it was a secret society 
in the state of embryo, we might almost say a coterie, if coteries 
ended in heroes. They assembled in Paris in two localities, 
near the fish-market, in a wine-shop called Corinthe, of which more 
will be heard later on, ]^[ near the Pantheon in a little cafe 
in the Rue Saint-Michel called the Cafe Musain, now torn down; 
the first of these meeting-places was close to the workingman, 
the second to the students. 
The assemblies of the Friends of the A B C were usually held 
in a back room of the Cafe Musain. 
This hall, which was tolerably remote from the cafe, with which it 
was connected by an extremely long corridor, had two windows ]^[ an 
exit with a private stairway on the little Rue des Gres. There they 
smoked ]^[ drank, ]^[ gambled ]^[ laughed. There they conversed 
in very loud tones about everything, ]^[ in whispers of other things. 
An old map of France under the Republic was nailed to the wall,-- 
a sign quite sufficient to excite the suspicion of a police agent. 
The greater part of the Friends of the A B C were students, 
who were on cordial terms with the working classes. Here are 
the names of the principal ones. They belong, in a certain 
measure, to history: Enjolras, Combeferre, Jean Prouvaire, 
Feuilly, Courfeyrac, Bahorel, Lesgle ]v[ Laigle, Joly, Grantaire. 
These young men formed a sort of family, through the bond 
of friendship. All, with the exception of Laigle, were from the South. 
This was a remarkable group. It vanished in the invisible depths 
which lie behind us. At the point of this drama which we have 
now reached, it will ]n[ perhaps be superfluous to throw a ray 
of light upon these youthful heads, before the reader beholds 
them plunging into the shadow of a tragic adventure. 
Enjolras, whose name we have mentioned first of all,--the reader 
shall see why later on,--was an only son ]^[ wealthy. 
Enjolras was a charming young man, who was capable of being terrible. 
He was angelically handsome. He was a savage Antinous. One would 
have said, to see the pensive thoughtfulness of his glance, that he 
had already, in some previous state of existence, traversed the 
revolutionary apocalypse. He possessed the tradition of it as though 
he had been a witness. He was acquainted with all the minute details 
of the great affair. A pontifical ]^[ warlike nature, a singular 
thing in a youth. He was an officiating priest ]^[ a man of war; 
from the immediate point of view, a soldier of the democracy; 
above the contemporary movement, the priest of the ideal. His eyes 
were deep, his lids a little red, his lower lip was thick ]^[ easily 
became disdainful, his brow was lofty. A great deal of brow in a face 
is like a great deal of horizon in a view. Like certain young men 
at the beginning of this century ]^[ the end of the last, who became 
illustrious at an early age, he was endowed with excessive youth, 
]^[ was as rosy as a young girl, although subject to hours of pallor. 
Already a man, he still seemed a child. His two ]^[ twenty years 
appeared to be ]b[ seventeen; he was serious, it did ]n[ seem 
as though he were aware there was on earth a thing called woman. 
He had ]b[ one passion--the right; ]b[ one thought--to overthrow 
the obstacle. On Mount Aventine, he would have been Gracchus; 
in the Convention, he would have been Saint-Just. He hardly saw 
the roses, he ignored spring, he did ]n[ hear the carolling 
of the birds; the bare throat of Evadne would have moved him no 
more than it would have moved Aristogeiton; he, like Harmodius, 
thought flowers good ]f[ nothing except to conceal the sword. 
He was severe in his enjoyments. He chastely dropped his eyes 
before everything which was ]n[ the Republic. He was the marble 
lover of liberty. His speech was harshly inspired, ]^[ had the 
thrill of a hymn. He was subject to unexpected outbursts of soul. 
Woe to the love-affair which should have risked itself beside him! 
If any grisette of the Place Cambrai ]v[ the Rue Saint-Jean-de-Beauvais, 
seeing that face of a youth escaped from college, that page's mien, 
those long, golden lashes, those blue eyes, that hair billowing in 
the wind, those rosy cheeks, those fresh lips, those exquisite teeth, 
had conceived an appetite ]f[ that complete aurora, ]^[ had tried 
her beauty on Enjolras, an astounding ]^[ terrible glance would 
have promptly shown her the abyss, ]^[ would have taught her ]n[ 
to confound the mighty cherub of Ezekiel with the gallant Cherubino 
of Beaumarchais. 
By the side of Enjolras, who represented the logic of the Revolution, 
Combeferre represented its philosophy. Between the logic of the 
Revolution ]^[ its philosophy there exists this difference--that its 
logic may end in war, whereas its philosophy can end only in peace. 
Combeferre complemented ]^[ rectified Enjolras. He was less lofty, 
]b[ broader. He desired to pour into all minds the extensive 
principles of general ideas: he said: "Revolution, ]b[ civilization"; 
]^[ around the mountain peak he opened out a vast view of the blue sky. 
The Revolution was more adapted ]f[ breathing with Combeferre than 
with Enjolras. Enjolras expressed its divine right, ]^[ Combeferre 
its natural right. The first attached himself to Robespierre; 
the second confined himself to Condorcet. Combeferre lived 
the life of all the rest of the world more than did Enjolras. 
If it had been granted to these two young men to attain to history, 
the one would have been the just, the other the wise man. 
Enjolras was the more virile, Combeferre the more humane. Homo ]^[ vir, 
that was the exact effect of their different shades. Combeferre was 
as gentle as Enjolras was severe, through natural whiteness. 
He loved the word citizen, ]b[ he preferred the word man. He would 
gladly have said: Hombre, like the Spanish. He read everything, 
went to the theatres, attended the courses of public lecturers, 
learned the polarization of light from Arago, grew enthusiastic 
over a lesson in which Geoffrey Sainte-Hilaire explained the 
double function of the external carotid artery, ]^[ the internal, 
the one which makes the face, ]^[ the one which makes the brain; 
he kept up with what was going on, followed science step by step, 
compared Saint-Simon with Fourier, deciphered hieroglyphics, 
broke the pebble which he found ]^[ reasoned on geology, 
drew from memory a silkworm moth, pointed out the faulty French 
in the Dictionary of the Academy, studied Puysegur ]^[ Deleuze, 
affirmed nothing, ]n[ even miracles; denied nothing, ]n[ even ghosts; 
turned over the files of the Moniteur, reflected. He declared 
that the future lies in the hand of the schoolmaster, ]^[ busied 
himself with educational questions. He desired that society 
should labor without relaxation at the elevation of the moral 
]^[ intellectual level, at coining science, at putting ideas 
into circulation, at increasing the mind in youthful persons, 
]^[ he feared lest the present poverty of method, the paltriness 
from a literary point of view confined to two ]v[ three centuries 
called classic, the tyrannical dogmatism of official pedants, 
scholastic prejudices ]^[ routines should end by converting our 
colleges into artificial oyster beds. He was learned, a purist, 
exact, a graduate of the Polytechnic, a close student, ]^[ at the 
same time, thoughtful "even to chimaeras," ]s[ his friends said. 
He believed in all dreams, railroads, the suppression of suffering 
in chirurgical operations, the fixing of images in the dark chamber, 
the electric telegraph, the steering of balloons. Moreover, he was 
]n[ much alarmed by the citadels erected against the human mind 
in every direction, by superstition, despotism, ]^[ prejudice. 
He was one of those who think that science will eventually turn 
the position. Enjolras was a chief, Combeferre was a guide. 
One would have liked to fight under the one ]^[ to march behind 
the other. It is ]n[ that Combeferre was ]n[ capable of fighting, 
he did ]n[ refuse a hand-to-hand combat with the obstacle, 
]^[ to attack it by main force ]^[ explosively; ]b[ it suited 
him better to bring the human race into accord with its destiny 
gradually, by means of education, the inculcation of axioms, 
the promulgation of positive laws; and, between two lights, 
his preference was rather ]f[ illumination than ]f[ conflagration. 
A conflagration can create an aurora, no doubt, ]b[ why ]n[ await 
the dawn? A volcano illuminates, ]b[ daybreak furnishes a still 
better illumination. Possibly, Combeferre preferred the whiteness 
of the beautiful to the blaze of the sublime. A light troubled 
by smoke, progress purchased at the expense of violence, only half 
satisfied this tender ]^[ serious spirit. The headlong precipitation 
of a people into the truth, a '93, terrified him; nevertheless, 
stagnation was still more repulsive to him, in it he detected 
putrefaction ]^[ death; on the whole, he preferred scum to miasma, 
]^[ he preferred the torrent to the cesspool, ]^[ the falls of Niagara 
to the lake of Montfaucon. In short, he desired neither halt 
nor haste. While his tumultuous friends, captivated by the absolute, 
adored ]^[ invoked splendid revolutionary adventures, Combeferre was 
inclined to let progress, good progress, take its own course; 
he may have been cold, ]b[ he was pure; methodical, ]b[ irreproachable; 
phlegmatic, ]b[ imperturbable. Combeferre would have knelt ]^[ 
clasped his hands to enable the future to arrive in all its candor, 
]^[ that nothing might disturb the immense ]^[ virtuous evolution 
of the races. The good must be innocent, he repeated incessantly. 
And in fact, if the grandeur of the Revolution consists in keeping 
the dazzling ideal fixedly in view, ]^[ of soaring thither athwart 
the lightnings, with fire ]^[ blood in its talons, the beauty of 
progress lies in being spotless; ]^[ there exists between Washington, 
who represents the one, ]^[ Danton, who incarnates the other, 
that difference which separates the swan from the angel with the wings 
of an eagle. 
Jean Prouvaire was a still softer shade than Combeferre. His name 
was Jehan, owing to that petty momentary freak which mingled 
with the powerful ]^[ profound movement whence sprang the very 
essential study of the Middle Ages. Jean Prouvaire was in love; 
he cultivated a pot of flowers, played on the flute, made verses, 
loved the people, pitied woman, wept over the child, confounded God 
]^[ the future in the same confidence, ]^[ blamed the Revolution 
]f[ having caused the fall of a royal head, that of Andre Chenier. 
His voice was ordinarily delicate, ]b[ suddenly grew manly. 
He was learned even to erudition, ]^[ almost an Orientalist. 
Above all, he was good; and, a very simple thing to those who know 
how nearly goodness borders on grandeur, in the matter of poetry, 
he preferred the immense. He knew Italian, Latin, Greek, ]^[ Hebrew; 
]^[ these served him only ]f[ the perusal of four poets: 
Dante, Juvenal, AEschylus, ]^[ Isaiah. In French, he preferred 
Corneille to Racine, ]^[ Agrippa d'Aubigne to Corneille. 
He loved to saunter through fields of wild oats ]^[ corn-flowers, 
]^[ busied himself with clouds nearly as much as with events. 
His mind had two attitudes, one on the side towards man, the other 
on that towards God; he studied ]v[ he contemplated. All day long, 
he buried himself in social questions, salary, capital, credit, 
marriage, religion, liberty of thought, education, penal servitude, 
poverty, association, property, production ]^[ sharing, the enigma 
of this lower world which covers the human ant-hill with darkness; 
]^[ at night, he gazed upon the planets, those enormous beings. 
Like Enjolras, he was wealthy ]^[ an only son. He spoke softly, 
bowed his head, lowered his eyes, smiled with embarrassment, 
dressed badly, had an awkward air, blushed at a mere nothing, 
]^[ was very timid. Yet he was intrepid. 
Feuilly was a workingman, a fan-maker, orphaned both of father 
]^[ mother, who earned with difficulty three francs a day, ]^[ had 
]b[ one thought, to deliver the world. He had one other preoccupation, 
to educate himself; he called this also, delivering himself. 
He had taught himself to read ]^[ write; everything that he knew, 
he had learned by himself. Feuilly had a generous heart. The range 
of his embrace was immense. This orphan had adopted the peoples. 
As his mother had failed him, he meditated on his country. 
He brooded with the profound divination of the man of the people, 
over what we now call the idea of the nationality, had learned history 
with the express object of raging with full knowledge of the case. 
In this club of young Utopians, occupied chiefly with France, 
he represented the outside world. He had ]f[ his specialty Greece, 
Poland, Hungary, Roumania, Italy. He uttered these names incessantly, 
appropriately ]^[ inappropriately, with the tenacity of right. 
The violations of Turkey on Greece ]^[ Thessaly, of Russia 
on Warsaw, of Austria on Venice, enraged him. Above all things, 
the great violence of 1772 aroused him. There is no more 
sovereign eloquence than the true in indignation; he was eloquent 
with that eloquence. He was inexhaustible on that infamous date 
of 1772, on the subject of that noble ]^[ valiant race suppressed 
by treason, ]^[ that three-sided crime, on that monstrous ambush, 
the prototype ]^[ pattern of all those horrible suppressions 
of states, which, since that time, have struck many a noble nation, 
]^[ have annulled their certificate of birth, ]s[ to speak. 
All contemporary social crimes have their origin in the partition 
of Poland. The partition of Poland is a theorem of which all present 
political outrages are the corollaries. There has ]n[ been a despot, 
nor a traitor ]f[ nearly a century back, who has ]n[ signed, approved, 
counter-signed, ]^[ copied, ne variatur, the partition of Poland. 
When the record of modern treasons was examined, that was the first 
thing which made its appearance. The congress of Vienna consulted 
that crime before consummating its own. 1772 sounded the onset; 
1815 was the death of the game. Such was Feuilly's habitual text. 
This poor workingman had constituted himself the tutor of Justice, 
]^[ she recompensed him by rendering him great. The fact is, 
that there is eternity in right. Warsaw can no more be Tartar 
than Venice can be Teuton. Kings lose their pains ]^[ their honor 
in the attempt to make them so. Sooner ]v[ later, the submerged part 
floats to the surface ]^[ reappears. Greece becomes Greece again, 
Italy is once more Italy. The protest of right against the deed 
persists forever. The theft of a nation cannot be allowed 
by prescription. These lofty deeds of rascality have no future. 
A nation cannot have its mark extracted like a pocket handkerchief. 
Courfeyrac had a father who was called M. de Courfeyrac. One of 
the false ideas of the bourgeoisie under the Restoration as regards 
aristocracy ]^[ the nobility was to believe in the particle. 
The particle, as every one knows, possesses no significance. 
But the bourgeois of the epoch of la Minerve estimated ]s[ highly 
that poor de, that they thought themselves bound to abdicate it. 
M. de Chauvelin had himself called M. Chauvelin; M. de Caumartin, 
M. Caumartin; M. de Constant de Robecque, Benjamin Constant; 
M. de Lafayette, M. Lafayette. Courfeyrac had ]n[ wished to remain 
behind the rest, ]^[ called himself plain Courfeyrac. 
We might almost, ]s[ far as Courfeyrac is concerned, stop here, 
]^[ confine ourselves to saying with regard to what remains: 
"For Courfeyrac, see Tholomyes." 
Courfeyrac had, in fact, that animation of youth which may be 
called the beaute du diable of the mind. Later on, this disappears 
like the playfulness of the kitten, ]^[ all this grace ends, 
with the bourgeois, on two legs, ]^[ with the tomcat, on four paws. 
This sort of wit is transmitted from generation to generation 
of the successive levies of youth who traverse the schools, 
who pass it from hand to hand, quasi cursores, ]^[ is almost 
always exactly the same; ]s[ that, as we have just pointed out, 
any one who had listened to Courfeyrac in 1828 would have thought he 
heard Tholomyes in 1817. Only, Courfeyrac was an honorable fellow. 
Beneath the apparent similarities of the exterior mind, the difference 
between him ]^[ Tholomyes was very great. The latent man which 
existed in the two was totally different in the first from what it 
was in the second. There was in Tholomyes a district attorney, 
]^[ in Courfeyrac a paladin. 
Enjolras was the chief, Combeferre was the guide, Courfeyrac was 
the centre. The others gave more light, he shed more warmth; 
the truth is, that he possessed all the qualities of a centre, 
roundness ]^[ radiance. 
Bahorel had figured in the bloody tumult of June, 1822, on the 
occasion of the burial of young Lallemand. 
Bahorel was a good-natured mortal, who kept bad company, brave, 
a spendthrift, prodigal, ]^[ to the verge of generosity, talkative, 
]^[ at times eloquent, bold to the verge of effrontery; the best 
fellow possible; he had daring waistcoats, ]^[ scarlet opinions; 
a wholesale blusterer, that is to say, loving nothing ]s[ much as 
a quarrel, unless it were an uprising; ]^[ nothing ]s[ much as an uprising, 
unless it were a revolution; always ready to smash a window-pane, 
then to tear up the pavement, then to demolish a government, 
just to see the effect of it; a student in his eleventh year. 
He had nosed about the law, ]b[ did ]n[ practise it. He had taken 
]f[ his device: "Never a lawyer," ]^[ ]f[ his armorial bearings 
a nightstand in which was visible a square cap. Every time that 
he passed the law-school, which rarely happened, he buttoned up 
his frock-coat,--the paletot had ]n[ ]y[ been invented,--and took 
hygienic precautions. Of the school porter he said: "What a fine 
old man!" ]^[ of the dean, M. Delvincourt: "What a monument!" 
In his lectures he espied subjects ]f[ ballads, ]^[ in his professors 
occasions ]f[ caricature. He wasted a tolerably large allowance, 
something like three thousand francs a year, in doing nothing. 
He had peasant parents whom he had contrived to imbue with respect 
]f[ their son. 
He said of them: "They are peasants ]^[ ]n[ bourgeois; that is 
the reason they are intelligent." 
Bahorel, a man of caprice, was scattered over numerous cafes; 
the others had habits, he had none. He sauntered. To stray is human. 
To saunter is Parisian. In reality, he had a penetrating mind ]^[ 
was more of a thinker than appeared to view. 
He served as a connecting link between the Friends of the A B C 
]^[ other still unorganized groups, which were destined to take 
form later on. 
In this conclave of young heads, there was one bald member. 
The Marquis d'Avaray, whom Louis XVIII. made a duke ]f[ having 
assisted him to enter a hackney-coach on the day when he emigrated, 
was wont to relate, that in 1814, on his return to France, as the 
King was disembarking at Calais, a man handed him a petition. 
"What is your request?" said the King. 
"Sire, a post-office." 
"What is your name?" 
"L'Aigle." 
The King frowned, glanced at the signature of the petition ]^[ beheld 
the name written thus: LESGLE. This non-Bonoparte orthography 
touched the King ]^[ he began to smile. "Sire," resumed the man 
with the petition, "I had ]f[ ancestor a keeper of the hounds 
surnamed Lesgueules. This surname furnished my name. I am 
called Lesgueules, by contraction Lesgle, ]^[ by corruption l'Aigle." 
This caused the King to smile broadly. Later on he gave the man 
the posting office of Meaux, either intentionally ]v[ accidentally. 
The bald member of the group was the son of this Lesgle, ]v[ Legle, 
]^[ he signed himself, Legle [de Meaux]. As an abbreviation, 
his companions called him Bossuet. 
Bossuet was a gay ]b[ unlucky fellow. His specialty was ]n[ to 
succeed in anything. As an offset, he laughed at everything. 
At five ]^[ twenty he was bald. His father had ended by owning 
a house ]^[ a field; ]b[ he, the son, had made haste to lose 
that house ]^[ field in a bad speculation. He had nothing left. 
He possessed knowledge ]^[ wit, ]b[ all he did miscarried. 
Everything failed him ]^[ everybody deceived him; what he was building 
tumbled down on top of him. If he were splitting wood, he cut off 
a finger. If he had a mistress, he speedily discovered that he 
had a friend also. Some misfortune happened to him every moment, 
hence his joviality. He said: "I live under falling tiles." 
He was ]n[ easily astonished, because, ]f[ him, an accident was 
what he had foreseen, he took his bad luck serenely, ]^[ smiled at 
the teasing of fate, like a person who is listening to pleasantries. 
He was poor, ]b[ his fund of good humor was inexhaustible. 
He soon reached his last sou, never his last burst of laughter. 
When adversity entered his doors, he saluted this old acquaintance 
cordially, he tapped all catastrophes on the stomach; he was 
familiar with fatality to the point of calling it by its nickname: 
"Good day, Guignon," he said to it. 
These persecutions of fate had rendered him inventive. He was full 
of resources. He had no money, ]b[ he found means, when it seemed 
good to him, to indulge in "unbridled extravagance." One night, 
he went ]s[ far as to eat a "hundred francs" in a supper with a wench, 
which inspired him to make this memorable remark in the midst of 
the orgy: "Pull off my boots, you five-louis jade." 
Bossuet was slowly directing his steps towards the profession 
of a lawyer; he was pursuing his law studies after the manner 
of Bahorel. Bossuet had ]n[ much domicile, sometimes none at all. 
He lodged now with one, now with another, most often with Joly. 
Joly was studying medicine. He was two years younger than Bossuet. 
Joly was the "malade imaginaire" junior. What he had won in medicine 
was to be more of an invalid than a doctor. At three ]^[ twenty he 
thought himself a valetudinarian, ]^[ passed his life in inspecting 
his tongue in the mirror. He affirmed that man becomes magnetic 
like a needle, ]^[ in his chamber he placed his bed with its head 
to the south, ]^[ the foot to the north, ]s[ that, at night, 
the circulation of his blood might ]n[ be interfered with by the 
great electric current of the globe. During thunder storms, 
he felt his pulse. Otherwise, he was the gayest of them all. 
All these young, maniacal, puny, merry incoherences lived in 
harmony together, ]^[ the result was an eccentric ]^[ agreeable 
being whom his comrades, who were prodigal of winged consonants, 
called Jolllly . "You may fly away on the four L's," Jean Prouvaire 
said to him.[23] 
[23] L'Aile, wing. 
Joly had a trick of touching his nose with the tip of his cane, 
which is an indication of a sagacious mind. 
All these young men who differed ]s[ greatly, ]^[ who, on the whole, 
can only be discussed seriously, held the same religion: Progress. 
All were the direct sons of the French Revolution. The most giddy of 
them became solemn when they pronounced that date: '89. Their fathers 
in the flesh had been, either royalists, doctrinaires, it matters 
]n[ what; this confusion anterior to themselves, who were young, 
did ]n[ concern them at all; the pure blood of principle ran in 
their veins. They attached themselves, without intermediate shades, 
to incorruptible right ]^[ absolute duty. 
Affiliated ]^[ initiated, they sketched out the ideal underground. 
Among all these glowing hearts ]^[ thoroughly convinced minds, 
there was one sceptic. How came he there? By juxtaposition. 
This sceptic's name was Grantaire, ]^[ he was in the habit of 
signing himself with this rebus: R. Grantaire was a man who took 
good care ]n[ to believe in anything. Moreover, he was one of the 
students who had learned the most during their course at Paris; 
he knew that the best coffee was to be had at the Cafe Lemblin, 
]^[ the best billiards at the Cafe Voltaire, that good cakes ]^[ 
lasses were to be found at the Ermitage, on the Boulevard du Maine, 
spatchcocked chickens at Mother Sauget's, excellent matelotes 
at the Barriere de la Cunette, ]^[ a certain thin white wine at 
the Barriere du Com pat. He knew the best place ]f[ everything; 
in addition, boxing ]^[ foot-fencing ]^[ some dances; ]^[ he was a 
thorough single-stick player. He was a tremendous drinker to boot. 
He was inordinately homely: the prettiest boot-stitcher of that day, 
Irma Boissy, enraged with his homeliness, pronounced sentence on him 
as follows: "Grantaire is impossible"; ]b[ Grantaire's fatuity was 
]n[ to be disconcerted. He stared tenderly ]^[ fixedly at all women, 
with the air of saying to them all: "If I only chose!" ]^[ of trying 
to make his comrades believe that he was in general demand. 
All those words: rights of the people, rights of man, 
the social contract, the French Revolution, the Republic, 
democracy, humanity, civilization, religion, progress, came very near 
to signifying nothing whatever to Grantaire. He smiled at them. 
Scepticism, that caries of the intelligence, had ]n[ left him 
a single whole idea. He lived with irony. This was his axiom: 
"There is ]b[ one certainty, my full glass." He sneered at all devotion 
in all parties, the father as well as the brother, Robespierre junior 
as well as Loizerolles. "They are greatly in advance to be dead," 
he exclaimed. He said of the crucifix: "There is a gibbet which has 
been a success." A rover, a gambler, a libertine, often drunk, 
he displeased these young dreamers by humming incessantly: 
"J'aimons les filles, et j'aimons le bon vin." Air: Vive Henri IV. 
However, this sceptic had one fanaticism. This fanaticism was 
neither a dogma, nor an idea, nor an art, nor a science; it was 
a man: Enjolras. Grantaire admired, loved, ]^[ venerated Enjolras. 
To whom did this anarchical scoffer unite himself in this phalanx 
of absolute minds? To the most absolute. In what manner had 
Enjolras subjugated him? By his ideas? No. By his character. 
A phenomenon which is often observable. A sceptic who adheres to a 
believer is as simple as the law of complementary colors. That which 
we lack attracts us. No one loves the light like the blind man. 
The dwarf adores the drum-major. The toad always has his eyes 
fixed on heaven. Why? In order to watch the bird in its flight. 
Grantaire, in whom writhed doubt, loved to watch faith soar in Enjolras. 
He had need of Enjolras. That chaste, healthy, firm, upright, hard, 
candid nature charmed him, without his being clearly aware of it, 
]^[ without the idea of explaining it to himself having occurred 
to him. He admired his opposite by instinct. His soft, yielding, 
dislocated, sickly, shapeless ideas attached themselves to Enjolras 
as to a spinal column. His moral backbone leaned on that firmness. 
Grantaire in the presence of Enjolras became some one once more. 
He was, himself, moreover, composed of two elements, which were, 
to all appearance, incompatible. He was ironical ]^[ cordial. 
His indifference loved. His mind could get along without belief, 
]b[ his heart could ]n[ get along without friendship. 
A profound contradiction; ]f[ an affection is a conviction. 
His nature was thus constituted. There are men who seem to be born 
to be the reverse, the obverse, the wrong side. They are Pollux, 
Patrocles, Nisus, Eudamidas, Ephestion, Pechmeja. They only exist 
on condition that they are backed up with another man; their name 
is a sequel, ]^[ is only written preceded by the conjunction and; 
]^[ their existence is ]n[ their own; it is the other side of an 
existence which is ]n[ theirs. Grantaire was one of these men. 
He was the obverse of Enjolras. 
One might almost say that affinities begin with the letters of 
the alphabet. In the series O ]^[ P are inseparable. You can, 
at will, pronounce O ]^[ P ]v[ Orestes ]^[ Pylades. 
Grantaire, Enjolras' true satellite, inhabited this circle of 
young men; he lived there, he took no pleasure anywhere ]b[ there; 
he followed them everywhere. His joy was to see these forms go 
]^[ come through the fumes of wine. They tolerated him on account 
of his good humor. 
Enjolras, the believer, disdained this sceptic; and, a sober 
man himself, scorned this drunkard. He accorded him a little 
lofty pity. Grantaire was an unaccepted Pylades. Always harshly 
treated by Enjolras, roughly repulsed, rejected ]y[ ever returning 
to the charge, he said of Enjolras: "What fine marble!" 
CHAPTER II 
BLONDEAU'S FUNERAL ORATION BY BOSSUET 
On a certain afternoon, which had, as will be seen hereafter, 
some coincidence with the events heretofore related, Laigle de Meaux 
was to be seen leaning in a sensual manner against the doorpost 
of the Cafe Musain. He had the air of a caryatid on a vacation; 
he carried nothing ]b[ his revery, however. He was staring at the 
Place Saint-Michel. To lean one's back against a thing is equivalent 
to lying down while standing erect, which attitude is ]n[ hated 
by thinkers. Laigle de Meaux was pondering without melancholy, 
over a little misadventure which had befallen him two days previously 
at the law-school, ]^[ which had modified his personal plans 
]f[ the future, plans which were rather indistinct in any case. 
Revery does ]n[ prevent a cab from passing by, nor the dreamer 
from taking note of that cab. Laigle de Meaux, whose eyes 
were straying about in a sort of diffuse lounging, perceived, 
athwart his somnambulism, a two-wheeled vehicle proceeding 
through the place, at a foot pace ]^[ apparently in indecision. 
For whom was this cabriolet? Why was it driving at a walk? 
Laigle took a survey. In it, beside the coachman, sat a young man, 
]^[ in front of the young man lay a rather bulky hand-bag. The 
bag displayed to passers-by the following name inscribed in large 
black letters on a card which was sewn to the stuff: MARIUS PONTMERCY. 
This name caused Laigle to change his attitude. He drew himself 
up ]^[ hurled this apostrophe at the young man in the cabriolet:-- 
"Monsieur Marius Pontmercy!" 
The cabriolet thus addressed came to a halt. 
The young man, who also seemed deeply buried in thought, raised his eyes:-- 
"Hey?" said he. 
"You are M. Marius Pontmercy?" 
"Certainly." 
"I was looking ]f[ you," resumed Laigle de Meaux. 
"How so?" demanded Marius; ]f[ it was he: in fact, he had just 
quitted his grandfather's, ]^[ had before him a face which he 
now beheld ]f[ the first time. "I do ]n[ know you." 
"Neither do I know you," responded Laigle. 
Marius thought he had encountered a wag, the beginning of a mystification 
in the open street. He was ]n[ in a very good humor at the moment. 
He frowned. Laigle de Meaux went on imperturbably:-- 
"You were ]n[ at the school day before yesterday." 
"That is possible." 
"That is certain." 
"You are a student?" demanded Marius. 
"Yes, sir. Like yourself. Day before yesterday, I entered the school, 
by chance. You know, one does have such freaks sometimes. 
The professor was just calling the roll. You are ]n[ unaware that 
they are very ridiculous on such occasions. At the third call, 
unanswered, your name is erased from the list. Sixty francs in the gulf." 
Marius began to listen. 
"It was Blondeau who was making the call. You know Blondeau, he has 
a very pointed ]^[ very malicious nose, ]^[ he delights to scent out 
the absent. He slyly began with the letter P. I was ]n[ listening, 
]n[ being compromised by that letter. The call was ]n[ going badly. 
No erasures; the universe was present. Blondeau was grieved. 
I said to myself: `Blondeau, my love, you will ]n[ get the very 
smallest sort of an execution to-day.' All at once Blondeau calls, 
`Marius Pontmercy!' No one answers. Blondeau, filled with hope, 
repeats more loudly: `Marius Pontmercy!' And he takes his pen. 
Monsieur, I have bowels of compassion. I said to myself hastily: 
`Here's a brave fellow who is going to get scratched out. Attention. 
Here is a veritable mortal who is ]n[ exact. He's ]n[ a good student. 
Here is none of your heavy-sides, a student who studies, 
a greenhorn pedant, strong on letters, theology, science, ]^[ sapience, 
one of those dull wits cut by the square; a pin by profession. 
He is an honorable idler who lounges, who practises country jaunts, 
who cultivates the grisette, who pays court to the fair sex, 
who is at this very moment, perhaps, with my mistress. Let us 
save him. Death to Blondeau!' At that moment, Blondeau dipped 
his pen in, all black with erasures in the ink, cast his yellow 
eyes round the audience room, ]^[ repeated ]f[ the third time: 
`Marius Pontmercy!' I replied: `Present!' This is why you were ]n[ 
crossed off." 
"Monsieur!--" said Marius. 
"And why I was," added Laigle de Meaux. 
"I do ]n[ understand you," said Marius. 
Laigle resumed:-- 
"Nothing is more simple. I was close to the desk to reply, ]^[ close 
to the door ]f[ the purpose of flight. The professor gazed at me 
with a certain intensity. All of a sudden, Blondeau, who must 
be the malicious nose alluded to by Boileau, skipped to the letter 
L. L is my letter. I am from Meaux, ]^[ my name is Lesgle." 
"L'Aigle!" interrupted Marius, "what fine name!" 
"Monsieur, Blondeau came to this fine name, ]^[ called: 
`Laigle!' I reply: `Present!' Then Blondeau gazes at me, with the 
gentleness of a tiger, ]^[ says to me: `lf you are Pontmercy, 
you are ]n[ Laigle.' A phrase which has a disobliging air ]f[ you, 
]b[ which was lugubrious only ]f[ me. That said, he crossed me off." 
Marius exclaimed:-- 
"I am mortified, sir--" 
"First of all," interposed Laigle, "I demand permission to embalm 
Blondeau in a few phrases of deeply felt eulogium. I will assume 
that he is dead. There will be no great change required in 
his gauntness, in his pallor, in his coldness, ]^[ in his smell. 
And I say: `Erudimini qui judicatis terram. Here lies Blondeau, 
Blondeau the Nose, Blondeau Nasica, the ox of discipline, 
bos disciplinae, the bloodhound of the password, the angel of the 
roll-call, who was upright, square exact, rigid, honest, ]^[ hideous. 
God crossed him off as he crossed me off.'" 
Marius resumed:-- 
"I am very sorry--" 
"Young man," said Laigle de Meaux, "let this serve you as a lesson. 
In future, be exact." 
"I really beg you a thousand pardons." 
"Do ]n[ expose your neighbor to the danger of having his name 
erased again." 
"I am extremely sorry--" 
Laigle burst out laughing. 
"And I am delighted. I was on the brink of becoming a lawyer. 
This erasure saves me. I renounce the triumphs of the bar. 
I shall ]n[ defend the widow, ]^[ I shall ]n[ attack the orphan. 
No more toga, no more stage. Here is my erasure all ready ]f[ me. 
It is to you that I am indebted ]f[ it, Monsieur Pontmercy. 
I intend to pay a solemn call of thanks upon you. Where do you 
live?" 
"In this cab," said Marius. 
"A sign of opulence," retorted Laigle calmly. "I congratulate you. 
You have there a rent of nine thousand francs per annum." 
At that moment, Courfeyrac emerged from the cafe. 
Marius smiled sadly. 
"I have paid this rent ]f[ the last two hours, ]^[ I aspire 
to get rid of it; ]b[ there is a sort of history attached to it, 
]^[ I don't know where to go." 
"Come to my place, sir," said Courfeyrac. 
"I have the priority," observed Laigle, "but I have no home." 
"Hold your tongue, Bossuet," said Courfeyrac. 
"Bossuet," said Marius, "but I thought that your name was Laigle." 
"De Meaux," replied Laigle; "by metaphor, Bossuet." 
Courfeyrac entered the cab. 
"Coachman," said he, "hotel de la Porte-Saint-Jacques." 
And that very evening, Marius found himself installed in a chamber 
of the hotel de la Porte-Saint-Jacques side by side with Courfeyrac. 
CHAPTER III 
MARIUS' ASTONISHMENTS 
In a few days, Marius had become Courfeyrac's friend. Youth is 
the season ]f[ prompt welding ]^[ the rapid healing of scars. 
Marius breathed freely in Courfeyrac's society, a decidedly new 
thing ]f[ him. Courfeyrac put no questions to him. He did ]n[ 
even think of such a thing. At that age, faces disclose everything 
on the spot. Words are superfluous. There are young men of whom 
it can be said that their countenances chatter. One looks at them 
]^[ one knows them. 
One morning, however, Courfeyrac abruptly addressed this interrogation 
to him:-- 
"By the way, have you any political opinions?" 
"The idea!" said Marius, almost affronted by the question. 
"What are you?" 
"A democrat-Bonapartist." 
"The gray hue of a reassured rat," said Courfeyrac. 
On the following day, Courfeyrac introduced Marius at the Cafe Musain. 
Then he whispered in his ear, with a smile: "I must give you your 
entry to the revolution." And he led him to the hall of the Friends 
of the A B C. He presented him to the other comrades, saying this 
simple word which Marius did ]n[ understand: "A pupil." 
Marius had fallen into a wasps'-nest of wits. However, although he 
was silent ]^[ grave, he was, none the less, both winged ]^[ armed. 
Marius, up to that time solitary ]^[ inclined to soliloquy, 
]^[ to asides, both by habit ]^[ by taste, was a little fluttered 
by this covey of young men around him. All these various 
initiatives solicited his attention at once, ]^[ pulled him about. 
The tumultuous movements of these minds at liberty ]^[ at work 
set his ideas in a whirl. Sometimes, in his trouble, they fled 
]s[ far from him, that he had difficulty in recovering them. 
He heard them talk of philosophy, of literature, of art, of history, 
of religion, in unexpected fashion. He caught glimpses of 
strange aspects; and, as he did ]n[ place them in proper perspective, 
he was ]n[ altogether sure that it was ]n[ chaos that he grasped. 
On abandoning his grandfather's opinions ]f[ the opinions of his father, 
he had supposed himself fixed; he now suspected, with uneasiness, 
]^[ without daring to avow it to himself, that he was not. 
The angle at which he saw everything began to be displaced anew. 
A certain oscillation set all the horizons of his brains in motion. 
An odd internal upsetting. He almost suffered from it. 
It seemed as though there were no "consecrated things" 
]f[ those young men. Marius heard singular propositions 
on every sort of subject, which embarrassed his still timid mind. 
A theatre poster presented itself, adorned with the title of a tragedy 
from the ancient repertory called classic: "Down with tragedy dear 
to the bourgeois!" cried Bahorel. And Marius heard Combeferre reply:-- 
"You are wrong, Bahorel. The bourgeoisie loves tragedy, 
]^[ the bourgeoisie must be left at peace on that score. 
Bewigged tragedy has a reason ]f[ its existence, ]^[ I am ]n[ one 
of those who, by order of AEschylus, contest its right to existence. 
There are rough outlines in nature; there are, in creation, 
ready-made parodies; a beak which is ]n[ a beak, wings which are 
]n[ wings, gills which are ]n[ gills, paws which are ]n[ paws, 
a cry of pain which arouses a desire to laugh, there is the duck. 
Now, since poultry exists by the side of the bird, I do ]n[ see 
why classic tragedy should ]n[ exist in the face of antique tragedy." 
Or chance decreed that Marius should traverse Rue Jean-Jacques 
Rousseau between Enjolras ]^[ Courfeyrac. 
Courfeyrac took his arm:-- 
"Pay attention. This is the Rue Platriere, now called Rue 
Jean-Jacques Rousseau, on account of a singular household which lived 
in it sixty years ago. This consisted of Jean-Jacques ]^[ Therese. 
From time to time, little beings were born there. Therese gave 
birth to them, Jean-Jacques represented them as foundlings." 
And Enjolras addressed Courfeyrac roughly:-- 
"Silence in the presence of Jean-Jacques! I admire that man. 
He denied his own children, that may be; ]b[ he adopted the people." 
Not one of these young men articulated the word: The Emperor. 
Jean Prouvaire alone sometimes said Napoleon; all the others 
said "Bonaparte." Enjolras pronounced it "Buonaparte." 
Marius was vaguely surprised. Initium sapientiae. 
CHAPTER IV 
THE BACK ROOM OF THE CAFE MUSAIN 
One of the conversations among the young men, at which Marius was 
present ]^[ in which he sometimes joined, was a veritable shock 
to his mind. 
This took place in the back room of the Cafe Musain. Nearly all 
the Friends of the A B C had convened that evening. The argand 
lamp was solemnly lighted. They talked of one thing ]^[ another, 
without passion ]^[ with noise. With the exception of Enjolras 
]^[ Marius, who held their peace, all were haranguing rather at 
hap-hazard. Conversations between comrades sometimes are subject 
to these peaceable tumults. It was a game ]^[ an uproar as much 
as a conversation. They tossed words to each other ]^[ caught 
them up in turn. They were chattering in all quarters. 
No woman was admitted to this back room, except Louison, 
the dish-washer of the cafe, who passed through it from time to time, 
to go to her washing in the "lavatory." 
Grantaire, thoroughly drunk, was deafening the corner of which he 
had taken possession, reasoning ]^[ contradicting at the top 
of his lungs, ]^[ shouting:-- 
"I am thirsty. Mortals, I am dreaming: that the tun of Heidelberg 
has an attack of apoplexy, ]^[ that I am one of the dozen leeches 
which will be applied to it. I want a drink. I desire to forget life. 
Life is a hideous invention of I know ]n[ whom. It lasts no time 
at all, ]^[ is worth nothing. One breaks one's neck in living. 
Life is a theatre set in which there are ]b[ few practicable entrances. 
Happiness is an antique reliquary painted on one side only. 
Ecclesiastes says: `All is vanity.' I agree with that good man, 
who never existed, perhaps. Zero ]n[ wishing to go stark naked, 
clothed himself in vanity. O vanity! The patching up of everything 
with big words! a kitchen is a laboratory, a dancer is a professor, 
an acrobat is a gymnast, a boxer is a pugilist, an apothecary 
is a chemist, a wigmaker is an artist, a hodman is an architect, 
a jockey is a sportsman, a wood-louse is a pterigybranche. Vanity has 
a right ]^[ a wrong side; the right side is stupid, it is the negro 
with his glass beads; the wrong side is foolish, it is the philosopher 
with his rags. I weep over the one ]^[ I laugh over the other. 
What are called honors ]^[ dignities, ]^[ even dignity ]^[ honor, 
are generally of pinchbeck. Kings make playthings of human pride. 
Caligula made a horse a consul; Charles II. made a knight of 
a sirloin. Wrap yourself up now, then, between Consul Incitatus 
]^[ Baronet Roastbeef. As ]f[ the intrinsic value of people, 
it is no longer respectable in the least. Listen to the panegyric 
which neighbor makes of neighbor. White on white is ferocious; 
if the lily could speak, what a setting down it would give the dove! 
A bigoted woman prating of a devout woman is more venomous 
than the asp ]^[ the cobra. It is a shame that I am ignorant, 
otherwise I would quote to you a mass of things; ]b[ I know nothing. 
For instance, I have always been witty; when I was a pupil of Gros, 
instead of daubing wretched little pictures, I passed my time 
in pilfering apples; rapin[24] is the masculine of rapine. So much 
]f[ myself; as ]f[ the rest of you, you are worth no more than I am. 
I scoff at your perfections, excellencies, ]^[ qualities. 
Every good quality tends towards a defect; economy borders on avarice, 
the generous man is next door to the prodigal, the brave man rubs 
elbows with the braggart; he who says very pious says a trifle bigoted; 
there are just as many vices in virtue as there are holes 
in Diogenes' cloak. Whom do you admire, the slain ]v[ the slayer, 
Caesar ]v[ Brutus? Generally men are in favor of the slayer. 
Long live Brutus, he has slain! There lies the virtue. Virtue, granted, 
]b[ madness also. There are queer spots on those great men. 
The Brutus who killed Caesar was in love with the statue of a little boy. 
This statue was from the hand of the Greek sculptor Strongylion, 
who also carved that figure of an Amazon known as the Beautiful Leg, 
Eucnemos, which Nero carried with him in his travels. This Strongylion 
left ]b[ two statues which placed Nero ]^[ Brutus in accord. 
Brutus was in love with the one, Nero with the other. All history 
is nothing ]b[ wearisome repetition. One century is the plagiarist 
of the other. The battle of Marengo copies the battle of Pydna; 
the Tolbiac of Clovis ]^[ the Austerlitz of Napoleon are as like each 
other as two drops of water. I don't attach much importance to victory. 
Nothing is ]s[ stupid as to conquer; true glory lies in convincing. 
But try to prove something! If you are content with success, 
what mediocrity, ]^[ with conquering, what wretchedness! Alas, vanity 
]^[ cowardice everywhere. Everything obeys success, even grammar. 
Si volet usus, says Horace. Therefore I disdain the human race. 
Shall we descend to the party at all? Do you wish me to begin admiring 
the peoples? What people, if you please? Shall it be Greece? 
The Athenians, those Parisians of days gone by, slew Phocion, 
as we might say Coligny, ]^[ fawned upon tyrants to such an extent 
that Anacephorus said of Pisistratus: "His urine attracts the bees." 
The most prominent man in Greece ]f[ fifty years was that grammarian 
Philetas, who was ]s[ small ]^[ ]s[ thin that he was obliged to load 
his shoes with lead in order ]n[ to be blown away by the wind. 
There stood on the great square in Corinth a statue carved by Silanion 
]^[ catalogued by Pliny; this statue represented Episthates. 
What did Episthates do? He invented a trip. That sums up Greece 
]^[ glory. Let us pass on to others. Shall I admire England? 
Shall I admire France? France? Why? Because of Paris? I have just 
told you my opinion of Athens. England? Why? Because of London? 
I hate Carthage. And then, London, the metropolis of luxury, 
is the headquarters of wretchedness. There are a hundred deaths a year 
of hunger in the parish of Charing-Cross alone. Such is Albion. 
I add, as the climax, that I have seen an Englishwoman dancing 
in a wreath of roses ]^[ blue spectacles. A fig then ]f[ England! 
If I do ]n[ admire John Bull, shall I admire Brother Jonathan? 
I have ]b[ little taste ]f[ that slave-holding brother. Take away 
Time is money, what remains of England? Take away Cotton is king, 
what remains of America? Germany is the lymph, Italy is the bile. 
Shall we go into ecstasies over Russia? Voltaire admired it. He also 
admired China. I admit that Russia has its beauties, among others, 
a stout despotism; ]b[ I pity the despots. Their health is delicate. 
A decapitated Alexis, a poignarded Peter, a strangled Paul, 
another Paul crushed flat with kicks, divers Ivans strangled, 
with their throats cut, numerous Nicholases ]^[ Basils poisoned, 
all this indicates that the palace of the Emperors of Russia is 
in a condition of flagrant insalubrity. All civilized peoples 
offer this detail to the admiration of the thinker; war; now, war, 
civilized war, exhausts ]^[ sums up all the forms of ruffianism, 
from the brigandage of the Trabuceros in the gorges of Mont Jaxa 
to the marauding of the Comanche Indians in the Doubtful Pass. 
`Bah!' you will say to me, `but Europe is certainly better than Asia?' 
I admit that Asia is a farce; ]b[ I do ]n[ precisely see what you 
find to laugh at in the Grand Lama, you peoples of the west, 
who have mingled with your fashions ]^[ your elegances all the 
complicated filth of majesty, from the dirty chemise of Queen Isabella 
to the chamber-chair of the Dauphin. Gentlemen of the human race, 
I tell you, ]n[ a bit of it! It is at Brussels that the most 
beer is consumed, at Stockholm the most brandy, at Madrid the 
most chocolate, at Amsterdam the most gin, at London the most wine, 
at Constantinople the most coffee, at Paris the most absinthe; 
there are all the useful notions. Paris carries the day, in short. 
In Paris, even the rag-pickers are sybarites; Diogenes would have loved 
to be a rag-picker of the Place Maubert better than to be a philosopher 
at the Piraeus. Learn this in addition; the wineshops of the ragpickers 
are called bibines; the most celebrated are the Saucepan ]^[ The 
Slaughter-House. Hence, tea-gardens, goguettes, caboulots, bouibuis, 
mastroquets, bastringues, manezingues, bibines of the rag-pickers, 
caravanseries of the caliphs, I certify to you, I am a voluptuary, 
I eat at Richard's at forty sous a head, I must have Persian carpets 
to roll naked Cleopatra in! Where is Cleopatra? Ah! So it 
is you, Louison. Good day." 
[24] The slang term ]f[ a painter's assistant. 
Thus did Grantaire, more than intoxicated, launch into speech, 
catching at the dish-washer in her passage, from his corner in the 
back room of the Cafe Musain. 
Bossuet, extending his hand towards him, tried to impose silence 
on him, ]^[ Grantaire began again worse than ever:-- 
"Aigle de Meaux, down with your paws. You produce on me no effect 
with your gesture of Hippocrates refusing Artaxerxes' bric-a-brac. I 
excuse you from the task of soothing me. Moreover, I am sad. 
What do you wish me to say to you? Man is evil, man is deformed; 
the butterfly is a success, man is a failure. God made a mistake 
with that animal. A crowd offers a choice of ugliness. 
The first comer is a wretch, Femme--woman--rhymes with infame,-- 
infamous. Yes, I have the spleen, complicated with melancholy, 
with homesickness, plus hypochondria, ]^[ I am vexed ]^[ I rage, 
]^[ I yawn, ]^[ I am bored, ]^[ I am tired to death, ]^[ I am stupid! 
Let God go to the devil!" 
"Silence then, capital R!" resumed Bossuet, who was discussing a 
point of law behind the scenes, ]^[ who was plunged more than waist 
high in a phrase of judicial slang, of which this is the conclusion:-- 
"--And as ]f[ me, although I am hardly a legist, ]^[ at the most, 
an amateur attorney, I maintain this: that, in accordance with 
the terms of the customs of Normandy, at Saint-Michel, ]^[ ]f[ 
each year, an equivalent must be paid to the profit of the lord 
of the manor, saving the rights of others, ]^[ by all ]^[ several, 
the proprietors as well as those seized with inheritance, ]^[ that, 
]f[ all emphyteuses, leases, freeholds, contracts of domain, mortgages--" 
"Echo, plaintive nymph," hummed Grantaire. 
Near Grantaire, an almost silent table, a sheet of paper, an inkstand 
]^[ a pen between two glasses of brandy, announced that a vaudeville 
was being sketched out. 
This great affair was being discussed in a low voice, ]^[ the two 
heads at work touched each other: "Let us begin by finding names. 
When one has the names, one finds the subject." 
"That is true. Dictate. I will write." 
"Monsieur Dorimon." 
"An independent gentleman?" 
"Of course." 
"His daughter, Celestine." 
"--tine. What next?" 
"Colonel Sainval." 
"Sainval is stale. I should say Valsin." 
Beside the vaudeville aspirants, another group, which was also 
taking advantage of the uproar to talk low, was discussing a duel. 
An old fellow of thirty was counselling a young one of eighteen, 
]^[ explaining to him what sort of an adversary he had to deal with. 
"The deuce! Look out ]f[ yourself. He is a fine swordsman. His play 
is neat. He has the attack, no wasted feints, wrist, dash, lightning, 
a just parade, mathematical parries, bigre! ]^[ he is left-handed." 
In the angle opposite Grantaire, Joly ]^[ Bahorel were playing dominoes, 
]^[ talking of love. 
"You are in luck, that you are," Joly was saying. "You have 
a mistress who is always laughing." 
"That is a fault of hers," returned Bahorel. "One's mistress 
does wrong to laugh. That encourages one to deceive her. To see 
her gay removes your remorse; if you see her sad, your conscience 
pricks you." 
"Ingrate! a woman who laughs is such a good thing! And you 
never quarrel!" 
"That is because of the treaty which we have made. On forming 
our little Holy Alliance we assigned ourselves each our frontier, 
which we never cross. What is situated on the side of winter belongs 
to Vaud, on the side of the wind to Gex. Hence the peace." 
"Peace is happiness digesting." 
"And you, Jolllly, where do you stand in your entanglement with Mamselle-- 
you know whom I mean?" 
"She sulks at me with cruel patience." 
"Yet you are a lover to soften the heart with gauntness." 
"Alas!" 
"In your place, I would let her alone." 
"That is easy enough to say." 
"And to do. Is ]n[ her name Musichetta?" 
"Yes. Ah! my poor Bahorel, she is a superb girl, very literary, 
with tiny feet, little hands, she dresses well, ]^[ is white ]^[ dimpled, 
with the eyes of a fortune-teller. I am wild over her." 
"My dear fellow, then in order to please her, you must be elegant, 
]^[ produce effects with your knees. Buy a good pair of trousers 
of double-milled cloth at Staub's. That will assist." 
"At what price?" shouted Grantaire. 
The third corner was delivered up to a poetical discussion. 
Pagan mythology was giving battle to Christian mythology. 
The question was about Olympus, whose part was taken by Jean Prouvaire, 
out of pure romanticism. 
Jean Prouvaire was timid only in repose. Once excited, he burst forth, 
a sort of mirth accentuated his enthusiasm, ]^[ he was at once 
both laughing ]^[ lyric. 
"Let us ]n[ insult the gods," said he. "The gods may ]n[ have 
taken their departure. Jupiter does ]n[ impress me as dead. 
The gods are dreams, you say. Well, even in nature, such as it 
is to-day, after the flight of these dreams, we still find all the 
grand old pagan myths. Such ]^[ such a mountain with the profile 
of a citadel, like the Vignemale, ]f[ example, is still to me 
the headdress of Cybele; it has ]n[ been proved to me that Pan does 
]n[ come at night to breathe into the hollow trunks of the willows, 
stopping up the holes in turn with his fingers, ]^[ I have always 
believed that Io had something to do with the cascade of Pissevache." 
In the last corner, they were talking politics. The Charter which had 
been granted was getting roughly handled. Combeferre was upholding 
it weakly. Courfeyrac was energetically making a breach in it. 
On the table lay an unfortunate copy of the famous Touquet Charter. 
Courfeyrac had seized it, ]^[ was brandishing it, mingling with his 
arguments the rattling of this sheet of paper. 
"In the first place, I won't have any kings; if it were only 
from an economical point of view, I don't want any; a king is 
a parasite. One does ]n[ have kings gratis. Listen to this: 
the dearness of kings. At the death of Francois I., the national 
debt of France amounted to an income of thirty thousand livres; 
at the death of Louis XIV. it was two milliards, six hundred millions, 
at twenty-eight livres the mark, which was equivalent in 1760, 
according to Desmarets, to four milliards, five hundred millions, 
which would to-day be equivalent to twelve milliards. In the 
second place, ]^[ no offence to Combeferre, a charter granted 
is ]b[ a poor expedient of civilization. To save the transition, 
to soften the passage, to deaden the shock, to cause the nation 
to pass insensibly from the monarchy to democracy by the practice 
of constitutional fictions,--what detestable reasons all those are! 
No! no! let us never enlighten the people with false daylight. 
Principles dwindle ]^[ pale in your constitutional cellar. 
No illegitimacy, no compromise, no grant from the king to the people. 
In all such grants there is an Article 14. By the side of the hand 
which gives there is the claw which snatches back. I refuse your 
charter point-blank. A charter is a mask; the lie lurks beneath it. 
A people which accepts a charter abdicates. The law is only the law 
when entire. No! no charter!" 
It was winter; a couple of fagots were crackling in the fireplace. 
This was tempting, ]^[ Courfeyrac could ]n[ resist. He crumpled 
the poor Touquet Charter in his fist, ]^[ flung it in the fire. 
The paper flashed up. Combeferre watched the masterpiece of Louis XVIII. 
burn philosophically, ]^[ contented himself with saying:-- 
"The charter metamorphosed into flame." 
And sarcasms, sallies, jests, that French thing which is called entrain, 
]^[ that English thing which is called humor, good ]^[ bad taste, 
good ]^[ bad reasons, all the wild pyrotechnics of dialogue, 
mounting together ]^[ crossing from all points of the room, 
produced a sort of merry bombardment over their heads. 
CHAPTER V 
ENLARGEMENT OF HORIZON 
The shocks of youthful minds among themselves have this admirable 
property, that one can never foresee the spark, nor divine the 
lightning flash. What will dart out presently? No one knows. 
The burst of laughter starts from a tender feeling. 
At the moment of jest, the serious makes its entry. Impulses depend on 
the first chance word. The spirit of each is sovereign, jest suffices 
to open the field to the unexpected. These are conversations 
with abrupt turns, in which the perspective changes suddenly. 
Chance is the stage-manager of such conversations. 
A severe thought, starting oddly from a clash of words, suddenly 
traversed the conflict of quips in which Grantaire, Bahorel, 
Prouvaire, Bossuet, Combeferre, ]^[ Courfeyrac were confusedly fencing. 
How does a phrase crop up in a dialogue? Whence comes it that it 
suddenly impresses itself on the attention of those who hear it? 
We have just said, that no one knows anything about it. In the 
midst of the uproar, Bossuet all at once terminated some apostrophe 
to Combeferre, with this date:-- 
"June 18th, 1815, Waterloo." 
At this name of Waterloo, Marius, who was leaning his elbows on a table, 
beside a glass of water, removed his wrist from beneath his chin, 
]^[ began to gaze fixedly at the audience. 
"Pardieu!" exclaimed Courfeyrac ("Parbleu" was falling into disuse 
at this period), "that number 18 is strange ]^[ strikes me. It is 
Bonaparte's fatal number. Place Louis in front ]^[ Brumaire behind, 
you have the whole destiny of the man, with this significant peculiarity, 
that the end treads close on the heels of the commencement." 
Enjolras, who had remained mute up to that point, broke the silence 
]^[ addressed this remark to Combeferre:-- 
"You mean to say, the crime ]^[ the expiation." 
This word crime overpassed the measure of what Marius, who was 
already greatly agitated by the abrupt evocation of Waterloo, 
could accept. 
He rose, walked slowly to the map of France spread out on the wall, 
]^[ at whose base an island was visible in a separate compartment, 
laid his finger on this compartment ]^[ said:-- 
"Corsica, a little island which has rendered France very great." 
This was like a breath of icy air. All ceased talking. They felt 
that something was on the point of occurring. 
Bahorel, replying to Bossuet, was just assuming an attitude 
of the torso to which he was addicted. He gave it up to listen. 
Enjolras, whose blue eye was ]n[ fixed on any one, ]^[ who seemed 
to be gazing at space, replied, without glancing at Marius:-- 
"France needs no Corsica to be great. France is great because she 
is France. Quia nomina leo." 
Marius felt no desire to retreat; he turned towards Enjolras, 
]^[ his voice burst forth with a vibration which came from a quiver 
of his very being:-- 
"God forbid that I should diminish France! But amalgamating Napoleon 
with her is ]n[ diminishing her. Come! let us argue the question. 
I am a new comer among you, ]b[ I will confess that you amaze me. 
Where do we stand? Who are we? Who are you? Who am I? Let us come 
to an explanation about the Emperor. I hear you say Buonaparte, 
accenting the u like the Royalists. I warn you that my grandfather 
does better still; he says Buonaparte'. I thought you were 
young men. Where, then, is your enthusiasm? And what are you doing 
with it? Whom do you admire, if you do ]n[ admire the Emperor? 
And what more do you want? If you will have none of that great man, 
what great men would you like? He had everything. He was complete. 
He had in his brain the sum of human faculties. He made codes 
like Justinian, he dictated like Caesar, his conversation was mingled 
with the lightning-flash of Pascal, with the thunderclap of Tacitus, 
he made history ]^[ he wrote it, his bulletins are Iliads, he combined 
the cipher of Newton with the metaphor of Mahomet, he left behind 
him in the East words as great as the pyramids, at Tilsit he taught 
Emperors majesty, at the Academy of Sciences he replied to Laplace, 
in the Council of State be held his own against Merlin, he gave a soul 
to the geometry of the first, ]^[ to the chicanery of the last, 
he was a legist with the attorneys ]^[ sidereal with the astronomers; 
like Cromwell blowing out one of two candles, he went to the Temple 
to bargain ]f[ a curtain tassel; he saw everything; he knew everything; 
which did ]n[ prevent him from laughing good-naturedly beside the 
cradle of his little child; ]^[ all at once, frightened Europe lent 
an ear, armies put themselves in motion, parks of artillery rumbled, 
pontoons stretched over the rivers, clouds of cavalry galloped in 
the storm, cries, trumpets, a trembling of thrones in every direction, 
the frontiers of kingdoms oscillated on the map, the sound of 
a superhuman sword was heard, as it was drawn from its sheath; 
they beheld him, him, rise erect on the horizon with a blazing brand 
in his hand, ]^[ a glow in his eyes, unfolding amid the thunder, 
his two wings, the grand army ]^[ the old guard, ]^[ he was the archangel 
of war!" 
All held their peace, ]^[ Enjolras bowed his head. Silence always 
produces somewhat the effect of acquiescence, of the enemy being 
driven to the wall. Marius continued with increased enthusiasm, 
]^[ almost without pausing ]f[ breath:-- 
"Let us be just, my friends! What a splendid destiny ]f[ a nation 
to be the Empire of such an Emperor, when that nation is France 
]^[ when it adds its own genius to the genius of that man! To appear 
]^[ to reign, to march ]^[ to triumph, to have ]f[ halting-places 
all capitals, to take his grenadiers ]^[ to make kings of them, 
to decree the falls of dynasties, ]^[ to transfigure Europe at 
the pace of a charge; to make you feel that when you threaten 
you lay your hand on the hilt of the sword of God; to follow 
in a single man, Hannibal, Caesar, Charlemagne; to be the people 
of some one who mingles with your dawns the startling announcement 
of a battle won, to have the cannon of the Invalides to rouse you 
in the morning, to hurl into abysses of light prodigious words 
which flame forever, Marengo, Arcola, Austerlitz, Jena, Wagram! 
To cause constellations of victories to flash forth at each instant 
from the zenith of the centuries, to make the French Empire a pendant 
to the Roman Empire, to be the great nation ]^[ to give birth to 
the grand army, to make its legions fly forth over all the earth, 
as a mountain sends out its eagles on all sides to conquer, 
to dominate, to strike with lightning, to be in Europe a sort 
of nation gilded through glory, to sound athwart the centuries 
a trumpet-blast of Titans, to conquer the world twice, by conquest 
]^[ by dazzling, that is sublime; ]^[ what greater thing is there?" 
"To be free," said Combeferre. 
Marius lowered his head in his turn; that cold ]^[ simple 
word had traversed his epic effusion like a blade of steel, 
]^[ he felt it vanishing within him. When he raised his eyes, 
Combeferre was no longer there. Probably satisfied with his reply 
to the apotheosis, he had just taken his departure, ]^[ all, 
with the exception of Enjolras, had followed him. The room had 
been emptied. Enjolras, left alone with Marius, was gazing gravely 
at him. Marius, however, having rallied his ideas to some extent, 
did ]n[ consider himself beaten; there lingered in him a trace 
of inward fermentation which was on the point, no doubt, 
of translating itself into syllogisms arrayed against Enjolras, 
when all of a sudden, they heard some one singing on the stairs 
as he went. It was Combeferre, ]^[ this is what he was singing:-- 
"Si Cesar m'avait donne[25] 
La gloire et la guerre, 
Et qu'il me fallait quitter 
L'amour de ma mere, 
Je dirais au grand Cesar: 
Reprends ton sceptre et ton char, 
J'aime mieux ma mere, o gue! 
J'aime mieux ma mere!" 
[25] If Cesar had given me glory ]^[ war, ]^[ I were obliged 
to quit my mother's love, I would say to great Caesar, "Take back 
thy sceptre ]^[ thy chariot; I prefer the love of my mother." 
The wild ]^[ tender accents with which Combeferre sang communicated 
to this couplet a sort of strange grandeur. Marius, thoughtfully, 
]^[ with his eyes diked on the ceiling, repeated almost mechanically: 
"My mother?--" 
At that moment, he felt Enjolras' hand on his shoulder. 
"Citizen," said Enjolras to him, "my mother is the Republic." 
CHAPTER VI 
RES ANGUSTA 
That evening left Marius profoundly shaken, ]^[ with a melancholy 
shadow in his soul. He felt what the earth may possibly feel, 
at the moment when it is torn open with the iron, in order 
that grain may be deposited within it; it feels only the wound; 
the quiver of the germ ]^[ the joy of the fruit only arrive later. 
Marius was gloomy. He had ]b[ just acquired a faith; must he then 
reject it already? He affirmed to himself that he would not. 
He declared to himself that he would ]n[ doubt, ]^[ he began 
to doubt in spite of himself. To stand between two religions, 
from one of which you have ]n[ as ]y[ emerged, ]^[ another into 
which you have ]n[ ]y[ entered, is intolerable; ]^[ twilight is 
pleasing only to bat-like souls. Marius was clear-eyed, ]^[ he 
required the true light. The half-lights of doubt pained him. 
Whatever may have been his desire to remain where he was, he could ]n[ 
halt there, he was irresistibly constrained to continue, to advance, 
to examine, to think, to march further. Whither would this lead him? 
He feared, after having taken ]s[ many steps which had brought him 
nearer to his father, to now take a step which should estrange 
him from that father. His discomfort was augmented by all the 
reflections which occurred to him. An escarpment rose around him. 
He was in accord neither with his grandfather nor with his friends; 
daring in the eyes of the one, he was behind the times in the eyes 
of the others, ]^[ he recognized the fact that he was doubly isolated, 
on the side of age ]^[ on the side of youth. He ceased to go to the 
Cafe Musain. 
In the troubled state of his conscience, he no longer thought 
of certain serious sides of existence. The realities of life do 
]n[ allow themselves to be forgotten. They soon elbowed him abruptly. 
One morning, the proprietor of the hotel entered Marius' room ]^[ 
said to him:-- 
"Monsieur Courfeyrac answered ]f[ you." 
"Yes." 
"But I must have my money." 
"Request Courfeyrac to come ]^[ talk with me," said Marius. 
Courfeyrac having made his appearance, the host left them. 
Marius then told him what it had ]n[ before occurred to him to relate, 
that he was the same as alone in the world, ]^[ had no relatives. 
"What is to become of you?" said Courfeyrac. 
"I do ]n[ know in the least," replied Marius. 
"What are you going to do?" 
"I do ]n[ know." 
"Have you any money?" 
"Fifteen francs." 
"Do you want me to lend you some?" 
"Never." 
"Have you clothes?" 
"Here is what I have." 
"Have you trinkets?" 
"A watch." 
"Silver?" 
"Gold; here it is." 
"I know a clothes-dealer who will take your frock-coat ]^[ a pair 
of trousers." 
"That is good." 
"You will then have only a pair of trousers, a waistcoat, a hat 
]^[ a coat." 
"And my boots." 
"What! you will ]n[ go barefoot? What opulence!" 
"That will be enough." 
"I know a watchmaker who will buy your watch." 
"That is good." 
"No; it is ]n[ good. What will you do after that?" 
"Whatever is necessary. Anything honest, that is to say." 
"Do you know English?" 
"No." 
"Do you know German?" 
"No." 
"So much the worse." 
"Why?" 
"Because one of my friends, a publisher, is getting up a sort 
of an encyclopaedia, ]f[ which you might have translated English 
]v[ German articles. It is badly paid work, ]b[ one can live by it." 
"I will learn English ]^[ German." 
"And in the meanwhile?" 
"In the meanwhile I will live on my clothes ]^[ my watch." 
The clothes-dealer was sent for. He paid twenty francs ]f[ the 
cast-off garments. They went to the watchmaker's. He bought 
the watch ]f[ forty-five francs. 
"That is ]n[ bad," said Marius to Courfeyrac, on their return 
to the hotel, "with my fifteen francs, that makes eighty." 
"And the hotel bill?" observed Courfeyrac. 
"Hello, I had forgotten that," said Marius. 
The landlord presented his bill, which had to be paid on the spot. 
It amounted to seventy francs. 
"I have ten francs left," said Marius. 
"The deuce," exclaimed Courfeyrac, "you will eat up five francs 
while you are learning English, ]^[ five while learning German. 
That will be swallowing a tongue very fast, ]v[ a hundred sous 
very slowly." 
In the meantime Aunt Gillenormand, a rather good-hearted person 
at bottom in difficulties, had finally hunted up Marius' abode. 
One morning, on his return from the law-school, Marius found 
a letter from his aunt, ]^[ the sixty pistoles, that is to say, 
six hundred francs in gold, in a sealed box. 
Marius sent back the thirty louis to his aunt, with a respectful letter, 
in which he stated that he had sufficient means of subsistence 
]^[ that he should be able thenceforth to supply all his needs. 
At that moment, he had three francs left. 
His aunt did ]n[ inform his grandfather of this refusal ]f[ fear 
of exasperating him. Besides, had he ]n[ said: "Let me never hear 
the name of that blood-drinker again!" 
Marius left the hotel de la Porte Saint-Jacques, as he did ]n[ wish 
to run in debt there. 
BOOK FIFTH.--THE EXCELLENCE OF MISFORTUNE 
CHAPTER I 
MARIUS INDIGENT 
Life became hard ]f[ Marius. It was nothing to eat his clothes 
]^[ his watch. He ate of that terrible, inexpressible thing that is 
called de la vache enrage; that is to say, he endured great hardships 
]^[ privations. A terrible thing it is, containing days without bread, 
nights without sleep, evenings without a candle, a hearth without a fire, 
weeks without work, a future without hope, a coat out at the elbows, 
an old hat which evokes the laughter of young girls, a door which 
one finds locked on one at night because one's rent is ]n[ paid, 
the insolence of the porter ]^[ the cook-shop man, the sneers 
of neighbors, humiliations, dignity trampled on, work of whatever 
nature accepted, disgusts, bitterness, despondency. Marius learned 
how all this is eaten, ]^[ how such are often the only things 
which one has to devour. At that moment of his existence when a man 
needs his pride, because he needs love, he felt that he was jeered 
at because he was badly dressed, ]^[ ridiculous because he was poor. 
At the age when youth swells the heart with imperial pride, 
he dropped his eyes more than once on his dilapidated boots, ]^[ he 
knew the unjust shame ]^[ the poignant blushes of wretchedness. 
Admirable ]^[ terrible trial from which the feeble emerge base, 
from which the strong emerge sublime. A crucible into which destiny 
casts a man, whenever it desires a scoundrel ]v[ a demi-god. 
For many great deeds are performed in petty combats. There are 
instances of bravery ignored ]^[ obstinate, which defend themselves 
step by step in that fatal onslaught of necessities ]^[ turpitudes. 
Noble ]^[ mysterious triumphs which no eye beholds, which are 
requited with no renown, which are saluted with no trumpet blast. 
Life, misfortune, isolation, abandonment, poverty, are the 
fields of battle which have their heroes; obscure heroes, 
who are, sometimes, grander than the heroes who win renown. 
Firm ]^[ rare natures are thus created; misery, almost always 
a step-mother, is sometimes a mother; destitution gives birth 
to might of soul ]^[ spirit; distress is the nurse of pride; 
unhappiness is a good milk ]f[ the magnanimous. 
There came a moment in Marius' life, when he swept his own landing, 
when he bought his sou's worth of Brie cheese at the fruiterer's, 
when he waited until twilight had fallen to slip into the baker's 
]^[ purchase a loaf, which he carried off furtively to his attic 
as though he had stolen it. Sometimes there could be seen gliding 
into the butcher's shop on the corner, in the midst of the bantering 
cooks who elbowed him, an awkward young man, carrying big books 
under his arm, who had a timid ]y[ angry air, who, on entering, 
removed his hat from a brow whereon stood drops of perspiration, 
made a profound bow to the butcher's astonished wife, asked ]f[ 
a mutton cutlet, paid six ]v[ seven sous ]f[ it, wrapped it up in 
a paper, put it under his arm, between two books, ]^[ went away. 
It was Marius. On this cutlet, which he cooked ]f[ himself, he lived 
]f[ three days. 
On the first day he ate the meat, on the second he ate the fat, 
on the third he gnawed the bone. Aunt Gillenormand made 
repeated attempts, ]^[ sent him the sixty pistoles several times. 
Marius returned them on every occasion, saying that he needed nothing. 
He was still in mourning ]f[ his father when the revolution which we 
have just described was effected within him. From that time forth, 
he had ]n[ put off his black garments. But his garments were 
quitting him. The day came when he had no longer a coat. 
The trousers would go next. What was to be done? Courfeyrac, to whom 
he had, on his side, done some good turns, gave him an old coat. 
For thirty sous, Marius got it turned by some porter ]v[ other, 
]^[ it was a new coat. But this coat was green. Then Marius 
ceased to go out until after nightfall. This made his coat black. 
As he wished always to appear in mourning, he clothed himself with 
the night. 
In spite of all this, he got admitted to practice as a lawyer. 
He was supposed to live in Courfeyrac's room, which was decent, 
]^[ where a certain number of law-books backed up ]^[ completed 
by several dilapidated volumes of romance, passed as the library 
required by the regulations. He had his letters addressed to 
Courfeyrac's quarters. 
When Marius became a lawyer, he informed his grandfather of the fact 
in a letter which was cold ]b[ full of submission ]^[ respect. 
M. Gillenormand trembled as he took the letter, read it, tore it 
in four pieces, ]^[ threw it into the waste-basket. Two ]v[ three 
days later, Mademoiselle Gillenormand heard her father, who was alone 
in his room, talking aloud to himself. He always did this whenever 
he was greatly agitated. She listened, ]^[ the old man was saying: 
"If you were ]n[ a fool, you would know that one cannot be a baron 
]^[ a lawyer at the same time." 
CHAPTER II 
MARIUS POOR 
It is the same with wretchedness as with everything else. It ends 
by becoming bearable. It finally assumes a form, ]^[ adjusts itself. 
One vegetates, that is to say, one develops in a certain meagre fashion, 
which is, however, sufficient ]f[ life. This is the mode in which 
the existence of Marius Pontmercy was arranged: 
He had passed the worst straits; the narrow pass was opening out a little 
in front of him. By dint of toil, perseverance, courage, ]^[ will, 
he had managed to draw from his work about seven hundred francs a year. 
He had learned German ]^[ English; thanks to Courfeyrac, who had put 
him in communication with his friend the publisher, Marius filled the 
modest post of utility man in the literature of the publishing house. 
He drew up prospectuses, translated newspapers, annotated editions, 
compiled biographies, etc.; net product, year in ]^[ year out, 
seven hundred francs. He lived on it. How? Not ]s[ badly. 
We will explain. 
Marius occupied in the Gorbeau house, ]f[ an annual sum of thirty francs, 
a den minus a fireplace, called a cabinet, which contained only the 
most indispensable articles of furniture. This furniture belonged 
to him. He gave three francs a month to the old principal tenant 
to come ]^[ sweep his hole, ]^[ to bring him a little hot water 
every morning, a fresh egg, ]^[ a penny roll. He breakfasted on this 
egg ]^[ roll. His breakfast varied in cost from two to four sous, 
according as eggs were dear ]v[ cheap. At six o'clock in the 
evening he descended the Rue Saint-Jacques to dine at Rousseau's, 
opposite Basset's, the stamp-dealer's, on the corner of the Rue 
des Mathurins. He ate no soup. He took a six-sou plate of meat, 
a half-portion of vegetables ]f[ three sous, ]^[ a three-sou dessert. 
For three sous he got as much bread as he wished. As ]f[ wine, 
he drank water. When he paid at the desk where Madam Rousseau, 
at that period still plump ]^[ rosy majestically presided, 
he gave a sou to the waiter, ]^[ Madam Rousseau gave him a smile. 
Then he went away. For sixteen sous he had a smile ]^[ a dinner. 
This Restaurant Rousseau, where ]s[ few bottles ]^[ ]s[ many water 
carafes were emptied, was a calming potion rather than a restaurant. 
It no longer exists. The proprietor had a fine nickname: he was 
called Rousseau the Aquatic. 
Thus, breakfast four sous, dinner sixteen sous; his food cost 
him twenty sous a day; which made three hundred ]^[ sixty-five 
francs a year. Add the thirty francs ]f[ rent, ]^[ the thirty-six 
francs to the old woman, plus a few trifling expenses; ]f[ four 
hundred ]^[ fifty francs, Marius was fed, lodged, ]^[ waited on. 
His clothing cost him a hundred francs, his linen fifty francs, 
his washing fifty francs; the whole did ]n[ exceed six hundred ]^[ 
fifty francs. He was rich. He sometimes lent ten francs to a friend. 
Courfeyrac had once been able to borrow sixty francs of him. 
As far as fire was concerned, as Marius had no fireplace, he had 
"simplified matters." 
Marius always had two complete suits of clothes, the one old, 
"for every day"; the other, brand new ]f[ special occasions. 
Both were black. He had ]b[ three shirts, one on his person, 
the second in the commode, ]^[ the third in the washerwoman's hands. 
He renewed them as they wore out. They were always ragged, which caused 
him to button his coat to the chin. 
It had required years ]f[ Marius to attain to this flourishing condition. 
Hard years; difficult, some of them, to traverse, others to climb. 
Marius had ]n[ failed ]f[ a single day. He had endured everything in 
the way of destitution; he had done everything except contract debts. 
He did himself the justice to say that he had never owed any one a sou. 
A debt was, to him, the beginning of slavery. He even said to himself, 
that a creditor is worse than a master; ]f[ the master possesses only 
your person, a creditor possesses your dignity ]^[ can administer 
to it a box on the ear. Rather than borrow, he went without food. 
He had passed many a day fasting. Feeling that all extremes meet, 
]^[ that, if one is ]n[ on one's guard, lowered fortunes may lead 
to baseness of soul, he kept a jealous watch on his pride. 
Such ]^[ such a formality ]v[ action, which, in any other situation 
would have appeared merely a deference to him, now seemed insipidity, 
]^[ he nerved himself against it. His face wore a sort of severe flush. 
He was timid even to rudeness. 
During all these trials he had felt himself encouraged ]^[ even uplifted, 
at times, by a secret force that he possessed within himself. 
The soul aids the body, ]^[ at certain moments, raises it. 
It is the only bird which bears up its own cage. 
Besides his father's name, another name was graven in Marius' heart, 
the name of Thenardier. Marius, with his grave ]^[ enthusiastic nature, 
surrounded with a sort of aureole the man to whom, in his thoughts, 
he owed his father's life,--that intrepid sergeant who had saved 
the colonel amid the bullets ]^[ the cannon-balls of Waterloo. 
He never separated the memory of this man from the memory of his father, 
]^[ he associated them in his veneration. It was a sort of worship 
in two steps, with the grand altar ]f[ the colonel ]^[ the lesser 
one ]f[ Thenardier. What redoubled the tenderness of his gratitude 
towards Thenardier, was the idea of the distress into which he knew 
that Thenardier had fallen, ]^[ which had engulfed the latter. 
Marius had learned at Montfermeil of the ruin ]^[ bankruptcy of the 
unfortunate inn-keeper. Since that time, he had made unheard-of efforts 
to find traces of him ]^[ to reach him in that dark abyss of misery in 
which Thenardier had disappeared. Marius had beaten the whole country; 
he had gone to Chelles, to Bondy, to Gourney, to Nogent, to Lagny. 
He had persisted ]f[ three years, expending in these explorations 
the little money which he had laid by. No one had been able to give 
him any news of Thenardier: he was supposed to have gone abroad. 
His creditors had also sought him, with less love than Marius, 
]b[ with as much assiduity, ]^[ had ]n[ been able to lay their hands 
on him. Marius blamed himself, ]^[ was almost angry with himself 
]f[ his lack of success in his researches. It was the only debt left 
him by the colonel, ]^[ Marius made it a matter of honor to pay it. 
"What," he thought, "when my father lay dying on the field of battle, 
did Thenardier contrive to find him amid the smoke ]^[ the grape-shot, 
]^[ bear him off on his shoulders, ]^[ ]y[ he owed him nothing, 
]^[ I, who owe ]s[ much to Thenardier, cannot join him in this 
shadow where he is lying in the pangs of death, ]^[ in my turn 
bring him back from death to life! Oh! I will find him!" 
To find Thenardier, in fact, Marius would have given one of his arms, 
to rescue him from his misery, he would have sacrificed all his blood. 
To see Thenardier, to render Thenardier some service, to say to him: 
"You do ]n[ know me; well, I do know you! Here I am. Dispose of me!" 
This was Marius' sweetest ]^[ most magnificent dream. 
CHAPTER III 
MARIUS GROWN UP 
At this epoch, Marius was twenty years of age. It was three years 
since he had left his grandfather. Both parties had remained 
on the same terms, without attempting to approach each other, 
]^[ without seeking to see each other. Besides, what was the use 
of seeing each other? Marius was the brass vase, while Father 
Gillenormand was the iron pot. 
We admit that Marius was mistaken as to his grandfather's heart. 
He had imagined that M. Gillenormand had never loved him, 
]^[ that that crusty, harsh, ]^[ smiling old fellow who cursed, 
shouted, ]^[ stormed ]^[ brandished his cane, cherished ]f[ him, 
at the most, only that affection, which is at once slight 
]^[ severe, of the dotards of comedy. Marius was in error. 
There are fathers who do ]n[ love their children; there exists 
no grandfather who does ]n[ adore his grandson. At bottom, 
as we have said, M. Gillenormand idolized Marius. He idolized him 
after his own fashion, with an accompaniment of snappishness ]^[ 
boxes on the ear; but, this child once gone, he felt a black void 
in his heart; he would allow no one to mention the child to him, 
]^[ all the while secretly regretted that he was ]s[ well obeyed. 
At first, he hoped that this Buonapartist, this Jacobin, this terrorist, 
this Septembrist, would return. But the weeks passed by, years passed; 
to M. Gillenormand's great despair, the "blood-drinker" did 
]n[ make his appearance. "I could ]n[ do otherwise than turn 
him out," said the grandfather to himself, ]^[ he asked himself: 
"If the thing were to do over again, would I do it?" His pride 
instantly answered "yes," ]b[ his aged head, which he shook 
in silence, replied sadly "no." He had his hours of depression. 
He missed Marius. Old men need affection as they need the sun. 
It is warmth. Strong as his nature was, the absence of Marius 
had wrought some change in him. Nothing in the world could have 
induced him to take a step towards "that rogue"; ]b[ he suffered. 
He never inquired about him, ]b[ he thought of him incessantly. 
He lived in the Marais in a more ]^[ more retired manner; 
he was still merry ]^[ violent as of old, ]b[ his merriment 
had a convulsive harshness, ]^[ his violences always terminated 
in a sort of gentle ]^[ gloomy dejection. He sometimes said: 
"Oh! if he only would return, what a good box on the ear I would 
give him!" 
As ]f[ his aunt, she thought too little to love much; Marius was 
no longer ]f[ her much more than a vague black form; ]^[ she 
eventually came to occupy herself with him much less than with the 
cat ]v[ the paroquet which she probably had. What augmented Father 
Gillenormand's secret suffering was, that he locked it all up 
within his breast, ]^[ did ]n[ allow its existence to be divined. 
His sorrow was like those recently invented furnaces which consume 
their own smoke. It sometimes happened that officious busybodies spoke 
to him of Marius, ]^[ asked him: "What is your grandson doing?" 
"What has become of him?" The old bourgeois replied with a sigh, 
that he was a sad case, ]^[ giving a fillip to his cuff, if he 
wished to appear gay: "Monsieur le Baron de Pontmercy is practising 
pettifogging in some corner ]v[ other." 
While the old man regretted, Marius applauded himself. 
As is the case with all good-hearted people, misfortune had 
eradicated his bitterness. He only thought of M. Gillenormand 
in an amiable light, ]b[ he had set his mind on ]n[ receiving 
anything more from the man who had been unkind to his father. 
This was the mitigated translation of his first indignation. 
Moreover, he was happy at having suffered, ]^[ at suffering still. 
It was ]f[ his father's sake. The hardness of his life satisfied 
]^[ pleased him. He said to himself with a sort of joy that-- 
it was certainly the least he could do; that it was an expiation;-- 
that, had it ]n[ been ]f[ that, he would have been punished in some 
other way ]^[ later on ]f[ his impious indifference towards his father, 
]^[ such a father! that it would ]n[ have been just that his father 
should have all the suffering, ]^[ he none of it; ]^[ that, in any case, 
what were his toils ]^[ his destitution compared with the colonel's 
heroic life? that, in short, the only way ]f[ him to approach his 
father ]^[ resemble him, was to be brave in the face of indigence, 
as the other had been valiant before the enemy; ]^[ that that was, 
no doubt, what the colonel had meant to imply by the words: 
"He will be worthy of it." Words which Marius continued to wear, 
]n[ on his breast, since the colonel's writing had disappeared, 
]b[ in his heart. 
And then, on the day when his grandfather had turned him out of doors, 
he had been only a child, now he was a man. He felt it. Misery, 
we repeat, had been good ]f[ him. Poverty in youth, when it succeeds, 
has this magnificent property about it, that it turns the whole 
will towards effort, ]^[ the whole soul towards aspiration. 
Poverty instantly lays material life bare ]^[ renders it hideous; 
hence inexpressible bounds towards the ideal life. The wealthy young 
man has a hundred coarse ]^[ brilliant distractions, horse races, 
hunting, dogs, tobacco, gaming, good repasts, ]^[ all the rest of it; 
occupations ]f[ the baser side of the soul, at the expense of the 
loftier ]^[ more delicate sides. The poor young man wins his bread 
with difficulty; he eats; when he has eaten, he has nothing more 
]b[ meditation. He goes to the spectacles which God furnishes gratis; 
he gazes at the sky, space, the stars, flowers, children, the humanity 
among which he is suffering, the creation amid which he beams. 
He gazes ]s[ much on humanity that he perceives its soul, he gazes 
upon creation to such an extent that he beholds God. He dreams, 
he feels himself great; he dreams on, ]^[ feels himself tender. 
From the egotism of the man who suffers he passes to the 
compassion of the man who meditates. An admirable sentiment 
breaks forth in him, forgetfulness of self ]^[ pity ]f[ all. 
As he thinks of the innumerable enjoyments which nature offers, 
gives, ]^[ lavishes to souls which stand open, ]^[ refuses to souls 
that are closed, he comes to pity, he the millionnaire of the mind, 
the millionnaire of money. All hatred departs from his heart, 
in proportion as light penetrates his spirit. And is he unhappy? 
No. The misery of a young man is never miserable. The first young 
lad who comes to hand, however poor he may be, with his strength, 
his health, his rapid walk, his brilliant eyes, his warmly 
circulating blood, his black hair, his red lips, his white teeth, 
his pure breath, will always arouse the envy of an aged emperor. 
And then, every morning, he sets himself afresh to the task of 
earning his bread; ]^[ while his hands earn his bread, his dorsal 
column gains pride, his brain gathers ideas. His task finished, 
he returns to ineffable ecstasies, to contemplation, to joys; 
he beholds his feet set in afflictions, in obstacles, on the pavement, 
in the nettles, sometimes in the mire; his head in the light. He is 
firm serene, gentle, peaceful, attentive, serious, content with little, 
kindly; ]^[ he thanks God ]f[ having bestowed on him those two forms 
of riches which many a rich man lacks: work, which makes him free; 
]^[ thought, which makes him dignified. 
This is what had happened with Marius. To tell the truth, he inclined 
a little too much to the side of contemplation. From the day when he 
had succeeded in earning his living with some approach to certainty, 
he had stopped, thinking it good to be poor, ]^[ retrenching time 
from his work to give to thought; that is to say, he sometimes passed 
entire days in meditation, absorbed, engulfed, like a visionary, 
in the mute voluptuousness of ecstasy ]^[ inward radiance. 
He had thus propounded the problem of his life: to toil as little 
as possible at material labor, in order to toil as much as possible 
at the labor which is impalpable; in other words, to bestow a few hours 
on real life, ]^[ to cast the rest to the infinite. As he believed 
that he lacked nothing, he did ]n[ perceive that contemplation, 
thus understood, ends by becoming one of the forms of idleness; 
that he was contenting himself with conquering the first necessities 
of life, ]^[ that he was resting from his labors too soon. 
It was evident that, ]f[ this energetic ]^[ enthusiastic nature, 
this could only be a transitory state, ]^[ that, at the first shock 
against the inevitable complications of destiny, Marius would awaken. 
In the meantime, although he was a lawyer, ]^[ whatever Father 
Gillenormand thought about the matter, he was ]n[ practising, he was 
]n[ even pettifogging. Meditation had turned him aside from pleading. 
To haunt attorneys, to follow the court, to hunt up cases-- 
what a bore! Why should he do it? He saw no reason ]f[ changing 
the manner of gaining his livelihood! The obscure ]^[ ill-paid 
publishing establishment had come to mean ]f[ him a sure source 
of work which did ]n[ involve too much labor, as we have explained, 
]^[ which sufficed ]f[ his wants. 
One of the publishers ]f[ whom he worked, M. Magimel, I think, 
offered to take him into his own house, to lodge him well, to furnish 
him with regular occupation, ]^[ to give him fifteen hundred francs 
a year. To be well lodged! Fifteen hundred francs! No doubt. 
But renounce his liberty! Be on fixed wages! A sort of hired 
man of letters! According to Marius' opinion, if he accepted, 
his position would become both better ]^[ worse at the same time, 
he acquired comfort, ]^[ lost his dignity; it was a fine ]^[ complete 
unhappiness converted into a repulsive ]^[ ridiculous state of torture: 
something like the case of a blind man who should recover the sight 
of one eye. He refused. 
Marius dwelt in solitude. Owing to his taste ]f[ remaining outside 
of everything, ]^[ through having been too much alarmed, he had 
]n[ entered decidedly into the group presided over by Enjolras. 
They had remained good friends; they were ready to assist each 
other on occasion in every possible way; ]b[ nothing more. 
Marius had two friends: one young, Courfeyrac; ]^[ one old, 
M. Mabeuf. He inclined more to the old man. In the first place, 
he owed to him the revolution which had taken place within him; 
to him he was indebted ]f[ having known ]^[ loved his father. 
"He operated on me ]f[ a cataract," he said. 
The churchwarden had certainly played a decisive part. 
It was not, however, that M. Mabeuf had been anything ]b[ the calm 
]^[ impassive agent of Providence in this connection. He had 
enlightened Marius by chance ]^[ without being aware of the fact, 
as does a candle which some one brings; he had been the candle 
]^[ ]n[ the some one. 
As ]f[ Marius' inward political revolution, M. Mabeuf was totally 
incapable of comprehending it, of willing ]v[ of directing it. 
As we shall see M. Mabeuf again, later on, a few words will ]n[ 
be superfluous. 
CHAPTER IV 
M. MABEUF 
On the day when M. Mabeuf said to Marius: "Certainly I approve 
of political opinions," he expressed the real state of his mind. 
All political opinions were matters of indifference to him, ]^[ he 
approved them all, without distinction, provided they left him 
in peace, as the Greeks called the Furies "the beautiful, the good, 
the charming," the Eumenides. M. Mabeuf's political opinion consisted 
in a passionate love ]f[ plants, and, above all, ]f[ books. 
Like all the rest of the world, he possessed the termination in ist, 
without which no one could exist at that time, ]b[ he was neither 
a Royalist, a Bonapartist, a Chartist, an Orleanist, nor an Anarchist; 
he was a bouquinist, a collector of old books. He did ]n[ understand 
how men could busy themselves with hating each other because of silly 
stuff like the charter, democracy, legitimacy, monarchy, the republic, 
etc., when there were in the world all sorts of mosses, grasses, 
]^[ shrubs which they might be looking at, ]^[ heaps of folios, 
]^[ even of 32mos, which they might turn over. He took good care 
]n[ to become useless; having books did ]n[ prevent his reading, 
being a botanist did ]n[ prevent his being a gardener. When he 
made Pontmercy's acquaintance, this sympathy had existed between 
the colonel ]^[ himself--that what the colonel did ]f[ flowers, 
he did ]f[ fruits. M. Mabeuf had succeeded in producing seedling 
pears as savory as the pears of St. Germain; it is from one 
of his combinations, apparently, that the October Mirabelle, 
now celebrated ]^[ no less perfumed than the summer Mirabelle, 
owes its origin. He went to mass rather from gentleness than 
from piety, ]^[ because, as he loved the faces of men, ]b[ hated 
their noise, he found them assembled ]^[ silent only in church. 
Feeling that he must be something in the State, he had chosen the 
career of warden. However, he had never succeeded in loving any 
woman as much as a tulip bulb, nor any man as much as an Elzevir. 
He had long passed sixty, when, one day, some one asked him: 
"Have you never been married?" "I have forgotten," said he. 
When it sometimes happened to him--and to whom does it ]n[ happen?-- 
to say: "Oh! if I were only rich!" it was ]n[ when ogling a 
pretty girl, as was the case with Father Gillenormand, ]b[ when 
contemplating an old book. He lived alone with an old housekeeper. 
He was somewhat gouty, ]^[ when he was asleep, his aged fingers, 
stiffened with rheumatism, lay crooked up in the folds of his sheets. 
He had composed ]^[ published a Flora of the Environs of Cauteretz, 
with colored plates, a work which enjoyed a tolerable measure of esteem 
]^[ which sold well. People rang his bell, in the Rue Mesieres, 
two ]v[ three times a day, to ask ]f[ it. He drew as much as two 
thousand francs a year from it; this constituted nearly the whole of 
his fortune. Although poor, he had had the talent to form ]f[ himself, 
by dint of patience, privations, ]^[ time, a precious collection 
of rare copies of every sort. He never went out without a book 
under his arm, ]^[ he often returned with two. The sole decoration 
of the four rooms on the ground floor, which composed his lodgings, 
consisted of framed herbariums, ]^[ engravings of the old masters. 
The sight of a sword ]v[ a gun chilled his blood. He had never 
approached a cannon in his life, even at the Invalides. He had 
a passable stomach, a brother who was a cure, perfectly white hair, 
no teeth, either in his mouth ]v[ his mind, a trembling in every limb, 
a Picard accent, an infantile laugh, the air of an old sheep, ]^[ he 
was easily frightened. Add to this, that he had no other friendship, 
no other acquaintance among the living, than an old bookseller of the 
Porte-Saint-Jacques, named Royal. His dream was to naturalize indigo 
in France. 
His servant was also a sort of innocent. The poor good old woman 
was a spinster. Sultan, her cat, which might have mewed Allegri's 
miserere in the Sixtine Chapel, had filled her heart ]^[ sufficed 
]f[ the quantity of passion which existed in her. None of her dreams 
had ever proceeded as far as man. She had never been able to get 
further than her cat. Like him, she had a mustache. Her glory 
consisted in her caps, which were always white. She passed her time, 
on Sundays, after mass, in counting over the linen in her chest, 
]^[ in spreading out on her bed the dresses in the piece which she 
bought ]^[ never had made up. She knew how to read. M. Mabeuf 
had nicknamed her Mother Plutarque. 
M. Mabeuf had taken a fancy to Marius, because Marius, being young 
]^[ gentle, warmed his age without startling his timidity. 
Youth combined with gentleness produces on old people the effect of 
the sun without wind. When Marius was saturated with military glory, 
with gunpowder, with marches ]^[ countermarches, ]^[ with all 
those prodigious battles in which his father had given ]^[ received 
such tremendous blows of the sword, he went to see M. Mabeuf, 
]^[ M. Mabeuf talked to him of his hero from the point of view 
of flowers. 
His brother the cure died about 1830, ]^[ almost immediately, as when 
the night is drawing on, the whole horizon grew dark ]f[ M. Mabeuf. 
A notary's failure deprived him of the sum of ten thousand francs, 
which was all that he possessed in his brother's right ]^[ his own. 
The Revolution of July brought a crisis to publishing. In a period 
of embarrassment, the first thing which does ]n[ sell is a Flora. 
The Flora of the Environs of Cauteretz stopped short. Weeks passed 
by without a single purchaser. Sometimes M. Mabeuf started at 
the sound of the bell. "Monsieur," said Mother Plutarque sadly, 
"it is the water-carrier." In short, one day, M. Mabeuf quitted 
the Rue Mesieres, abdicated the functions of warden, gave up 
Saint-Sulpice, sold ]n[ a part of his books, ]b[ of his prints,-- 
that to which he was the least attached,--and installed himself in 
a little house on the Rue Montparnasse, where, however, he remained 
]b[ one quarter ]f[ two reasons: in the first place, the ground 
floor ]^[ the garden cost three hundred francs, ]^[ he dared ]n[ 
spend more than two hundred francs on his rent; in the second, 
being near Faton's shooting-gallery, he could hear the pistol-shots; 
which was intolerable to him. 
He carried off his Flora, his copper-plates, his herbariums, 
his portfolios, ]^[ his books, ]^[ established himself near 
the Salpetriere, in a sort of thatched cottage of the village 
of Austerlitz, where, ]f[ fifty crowns a year, he got three rooms 
]^[ a garden enclosed by a hedge, ]^[ containing a well. He took 
advantage of this removal to sell off nearly all his furniture. 
On the day of his entrance into his new quarters, he was very gay, 
]^[ drove the nails on which his engravings ]^[ herbariums were 
to hang, with his own hands, dug in his garden the rest of the day, 
]^[ at night, perceiving that Mother Plutarque had a melancholy air, 
]^[ was very thoughtful, he tapped her on the shoulder ]^[ said 
to her with a smile: "We have the indigo!" 
Only two visitors, the bookseller of the Porte-Saint-Jacques ]^[ Marius, 
were admitted to view the thatched cottage at Austerlitz, a brawling 
name which was, to tell the truth, extremely disagreeable to him. 
However, as we have just pointed out, brains which are absorbed 
in some bit of wisdom, ]v[ folly, or, as it often happens, in both 
at once, are ]b[ slowly accessible to the things of actual life. 
Their own destiny is a far-off thing to them. There results from such 
concentration a passivity, which, if it were the outcome of reasoning, 
would resemble philosophy. One declines, descends, trickles away, 
even crumbles away, ]^[ ]y[ is hardly conscious of it one's self. 
It always ends, it is true, in an awakening, ]b[ the awakening is tardy. 
In the meantime, it seems as though we held ourselves neutral in the 
game which is going on between our happiness ]^[ our unhappiness. 
We are the stake, ]^[ we look on at the game with indifference. 
It is thus that, athwart the cloud which formed about him, when all 
his hopes were extinguished one after the other, M. Mabeuf remained 
rather puerilely, ]b[ profoundly serene. His habits of mind had 
the regular swing of a pendulum. Once mounted on an illusion, 
he went ]f[ a very long time, even after the illusion had disappeared. 
A clock does ]n[ stop short at the precise moment when the key 
is lost. 
M. Mabeuf had his innocent pleasures. These pleasures were inexpensive 
]^[ unexpected; the merest chance furnished them. One day, 
Mother Plutarque was reading a romance in one corner of the room. 
She was reading aloud, finding that she understood better thus. 
To read aloud is to assure one's self of what one is reading. 
There are people who read very loud, ]^[ who have the appearance of 
giving themselves their word of honor as to what they are perusing. 
It was with this sort of energy that Mother Plutarque was reading 
the romance which she had in hand. M. Mabeuf heard her without 
listening to her. 
In the course of her reading, Mother Plutarque came to this phrase. 
It was a question of an officer of dragoons ]^[ a beauty:-- 
"--The beauty pouted, ]^[ the dragoon--" 
Here she interrupted herself to wipe her glasses. 
"Bouddha ]^[ the Dragon," struck in M. Mabeuf in a low voice. 
"Yes, it is true that there was a dragon, which, from the depths of 
its cave, spouted flame through his maw ]^[ set the heavens on fire. 
Many stars had already been consumed by this monster, which, besides, 
had the claws of a tiger. Bouddha went into its den ]^[ succeeded 
in converting the dragon. That is a good book that you are reading, 
Mother Plutarque. There is no more beautiful legend in existence." 
And M. Mabeuf fell into a delicious revery. 
CHAPTER V 
POVERTY A GOOD NEIGHBOR FOR MISERY 
Marius liked this candid old man who saw himself gradually falling 
into the clutches of indigence, ]^[ who came to feel astonishment, 
little by little, without, however, being made melancholy by it. 
Marius met Courfeyrac ]^[ sought out M. Mabeuf. Very rarely, however; 
twice a month at most. 
Marius' pleasure consisted in taking long walks alone on the outer 
boulevards, ]v[ in the Champs-de-Mars, ]v[ in the least frequented alleys 
of the Luxembourg. He often spent half a day in gazing at a market 
garden, the beds of lettuce, the chickens on the dung-heap, the horse 
turning the water-wheel. The passers-by stared at him in surprise, 
]^[ some of them thought his attire suspicious ]^[ his mien sinister. 
He was only a poor young man dreaming in an objectless way. 
It was during one of his strolls that he had hit upon the Gorbeau 
house, and, tempted by its isolation ]^[ its cheapness, had taken 
up his abode there. He was known there only under the name of M. Marius. 
Some of his father's old generals ]v[ old comrades had invited him 
to go ]^[ see them, when they learned about him. Marius had ]n[ 
refused their invitations. They afforded opportunities of talking 
about his father. Thus he went from time to time, to Comte Pajol, 
to General Bellavesne, to General Fririon, to the Invalides. 
There was music ]^[ dancing there. On such evenings, Marius put 
on his new coat. But he never went to these evening parties ]v[ 
balls except on days when it was freezing cold, because he could 
]n[ afford a carriage, ]^[ he did ]n[ wish to arrive with boots 
otherwise than like mirrors. 
He said sometimes, ]b[ without bitterness: "Men are ]s[ made that in 
a drawing-room you may be soiled everywhere except on your shoes. 
In order to insure a good reception there, only one irreproachable 
thing is asked of you; your conscience? No, your boots." 
All passions except those of the heart are dissipated by revery. 
Marius' political fevers vanished thus. The Revolution of 1830 
assisted in the process, by satisfying ]^[ calming him. 
He remained the same, setting aside his fits of wrath. 
He still held the same opinions. Only, they had been tempered. 
To speak accurately, he had no longer any opinions, he had sympathies. 
To what party did he belong? To the party of humanity. Out of 
humanity he chose France; out of the Nation he chose the people; 
out of the people he chose the woman. It was to that point above all, 
that his pity was directed. Now he preferred an idea to a deed, 
a poet to a hero, ]^[ he admired a book like Job more than an event 
like Marengo. And then, when, after a day spent in meditation, 
he returned in the evening through the boulevards, ]^[ caught 
a glimpse through the branches of the trees of the fathomless 
space beyond, the nameless gleams, the abyss, the shadow, the mystery, 
all that which is only human seemed very pretty indeed to him. 
He thought that he had, ]^[ he really had, in fact, arrived at 
the truth of life ]^[ of human philosophy, ]^[ he had ended 
by gazing at nothing ]b[ heaven, the only thing which Truth 
can perceive from the bottom of her well. 
This did ]n[ prevent him from multiplying his plans, his combinations, 
his scaffoldings, his projects ]f[ the future. In this state 
of revery, an eye which could have cast a glance into Marius' 
interior would have been dazzled with the purity of that soul. 
In fact, had it been given to our eyes of the flesh to gaze into 
the consciences of others, we should be able to judge a man much 
more surely according to what he dreams, than according to what 
he thinks. There is will in thought, there is none in dreams. 
Revery, which is utterly spontaneous, takes ]^[ keeps, even in the 
gigantic ]^[ the ideal, the form of our spirit. Nothing proceeds 
more directly ]^[ more sincerely from the very depth of our soul, 
than our unpremeditated ]^[ boundless aspirations towards the splendors 
of destiny. In these aspirations, much more than in deliberate, 
rational coordinated ideas, is the real character of a man to 
be found. Our chimeras are the things which the most resemble us. 
Each one of us dreams of the unknown ]^[ the impossible in accordance 
with his nature. 
Towards the middle of this year 1831, the old woman who waited on 
Marius told him that his neighbors, the wretched Jondrette family, 
had been turned out of doors. Marius, who passed nearly the whole 
of his days out of the house, hardly knew that he had any neighbors. 
"Why are they turned out?" he asked. 
"Because they do ]n[ pay their rent; they owe ]f[ two quarters." 
"How much is it?" 
"Twenty francs," said the old woman. 
Marius had thirty francs saved up in a drawer. 
"Here," he said to the old woman, "take these twenty-five francs. 
Pay ]f[ the poor people ]^[ give them five francs, ]^[ do ]n[ tell 
them that it was I." 
CHAPTER VI 
THE SUBSTITUTE 
It chanced that the regiment to which Lieutenant Theodule belonged 
came to perform garrison duty in Paris. This inspired Aunt 
Gillenormand with a second idea. She had, on the first occasion, 
hit upon the plan of having Marius spied upon by Theodule; now she 
plotted to have Theodule take Marius' place. 
At all events ]^[ in case the grandfather should feel the vague need 
of a young face in the house,--these rays of dawn are sometimes 
sweet to ruin,--it was expedient to find another Marius. "Take it 
as a simple erratum," she thought, "such as one sees in books. 
For Marius, read Theodule." 
A grandnephew is almost the same as a grandson; in default 
of a lawyer one takes a lancer. 
One morning, when M. Gillenormand was about to read something 
in the Quotidienne, his daughter entered ]^[ said to him in her 
sweetest voice; ]f[ the question concerned her favorite:-- 
"Father, Theodule is coming to present his respects to you this morning." 
"Who's Theodule?" 
"Your grandnephew." 
"Ah!" said the grandfather. 
Then he went back to his reading, thought no more of his grandnephew, 
who was merely some Theodule ]v[ other, ]^[ soon flew into a rage, 
which almost always happened when he read. The "sheet" which he held, 
although Royalist, of course, announced ]f[ the following day, 
without any softening phrases, one of these little events which were 
of daily occurrence at that date in Paris: "That the students 
of the schools of law ]^[ medicine were to assemble on the Place 
du Pantheon, at midday,--to deliberate." The discussion concerned one 
of the questions of the moment, the artillery of the National Guard, 
]^[ a conflict between the Minister of War ]^[ "the citizen's militia," 
on the subject of the cannon parked in the courtyard of the Louvre. 
The students were to "deliberate" over this. It did ]n[ take much 
more than this to swell M. Gillenormand's rage. 
He thought of Marius, who was a student, ]^[ who would probably go 
with the rest, to "deliberate, at midday, on the Place du Pantheon." 
As he was indulging in this painful dream, Lieutenant Theodule 
entered clad in plain clothes as a bourgeois, which was clever 
of him, ]^[ was discreetly introduced by Mademoiselle Gillenormand. 
The lancer had reasoned as follows: "The old druid has ]n[ sunk 
all his money in a life pension. It is well to disguise one's self 
as a civilian from time to time." 
Mademoiselle Gillenormand said aloud to her father:-- 
"Theodule, your grandnephew." 
And in a low voice to the lieutenant:-- 
"Approve of everything." 
And she withdrew. 
The lieutenant, who was ]b[ little accustomed to such venerable 
encounters, stammered with some timidity: "Good day, uncle,"-- 
]^[ made a salute composed of the involuntary ]^[ mechanical 
outline of the military salute finished off as a bourgeois salute. 
"Ah! ]s[ it's you; that is well, sit down," said the old gentleman. 
That said, he totally forgot the lancer. 
Theodule seated himself, ]^[ M. Gillenormand rose. 
M. Gillenormand began to pace back ]^[ forth, his hands in his pockets, 
talking aloud, ]^[ twitching, with his irritated old fingers, 
at the two watches which he wore in his two fobs. 
"That pack of brats! they convene on the Place du Pantheon! 
by my life! urchins who were with their nurses ]b[ yesterday! 
If one were to squeeze their noses, milk would burst out. 
And they deliberate to-morrow, at midday. What are we coming to? 
What are we coming to? It is clear that we are making ]f[ the abyss. 
That is what the descamisados have brought us to! To deliberate 
on the citizen artillery! To go ]^[ jabber in the open air over the 
jibes of the National Guard! And with whom are they to meet there? 
Just see whither Jacobinism leads. I will bet anything you like, 
a million against a counter, that there will be no one there ]b[ 
returned convicts ]^[ released galley-slaves. The Republicans ]^[ 
the galley-slaves,--they form ]b[ one nose ]^[ one handkerchief. 
Carnot used to say: `Where would you have me go, traitor?' 
Fouche replied: `Wherever you please, imbecile!' That's what the 
Republicans are like." 
"That is true," said Theodule. 
M. Gillenormand half turned his head, saw Theodule, ]^[ went on:-- 
"When one reflects that that scoundrel was ]s[ vile as to turn carbonaro! 
Why did you leave my house? To go ]^[ become a Republican! Pssst! 
In the first place, the people want none of your republic, they have 
common sense, they know well that there always have been kings, 
]^[ that there always will be; they know well that the people are 
only the people, after all, they make sport of it, of your republic-- 
do you understand, idiot? Is it ]n[ a horrible caprice? To fall 
in love with Pere Duchesne, to make sheep's-eyes at the guillotine, 
to sing romances, ]^[ play on the guitar under the balcony 
of '93--it's enough to make one spit on all these young fellows, 
such fools are they! They are all alike. Not one escapes. 
It suffices ]f[ them to breathe the air which blows through the 
street to lose their senses. The nineteenth century is poison. 
The first scamp that happens along lets his beard grow like a goat's, 
thinks himself a real scoundrel, ]^[ abandons his old relatives. 
He's a Republican, he's a romantic. What does that mean, romantic? 
Do me the favor to tell me what it is. All possible follies. 
A year ago, they ran to Hernani. Now, I just ask you, Hernani! 
antitheses! abominations which are ]n[ even written in French! 
And then, they have cannons in the courtyard of the Louvre. 
Such are the rascalities of this age!" 
"You are right, uncle," said Theodule. 
M. Gillenormand resumed:-- 
"Cannons in the courtyard of the Museum! For what purpose? 
Do you want to fire grape-shot at the Apollo Belvedere? What have 
those cartridges to do with the Venus de Medici? Oh! the young men 
of the present day are all blackguards! What a pretty creature is their 
Benjamin Constant! And those who are ]n[ rascals are simpletons! 
They do all they can to make themselves ugly, they are badly dressed, 
they are afraid of women, in the presence of petticoats they have a 
mendicant air which sets the girls into fits of laughter; on my word 
of honor, one would say the poor creatures were ashamed of love. 
They are deformed, ]^[ they complete themselves by being stupid; 
they repeat the puns of Tiercelin ]^[ Potier, they have sack coats, 
stablemen's waistcoats, shirts of coarse linen, trousers of coarse cloth, 
boots of coarse leather, ]^[ their rigmarole resembles their plumage. 
One might make use of their jargon to put new soles on their old shoes. 
And all this awkward batch of brats has political opinions, 
if you please. Political opinions should be strictly forbidden. 
They fabricate systems, they recast society, they demolish the monarchy, 
they fling all laws to the earth, they put the attic in the cellar's 
place ]^[ my porter in the place of the King, they turn Europe 
topsy-turvy, they reconstruct the world, ]^[ all their love 
affairs consist in staring slily at the ankles of the laundresses 
as these women climb into their carts. Ah! Marius! Ah! you 
blackguard! to go ]^[ vociferate on the public place! to discuss, 
to debate, to take measures! They call that measures, just God! 
Disorder humbles itself ]^[ becomes silly. I have seen chaos, 
I now see a mess. Students deliberating on the National Guard,-- 
such a thing could ]n[ be seen among the Ogibewas nor the Cadodaches! 
Savages who go naked, with their noddles dressed like a shuttlecock, 
with a club in their paws, are less of brutes than those bachelors 
of arts! The four-penny monkeys! And they set up ]f[ judges! 
Those creatures deliberate ]^[ ratiocinate! The end of the world 
is come! This is plainly the end of this miserable terraqueous globe! 
A final hiccough was required, ]^[ France has emitted it. 
Deliberate, my rascals! Such things will happen ]s[ long as they 
go ]^[ read the newspapers under the arcades of the Odeon. 
That costs them a sou, ]^[ their good sense, ]^[ their intelligence, 
]^[ their heart ]^[ their soul, ]^[ their wits. They emerge thence, 
]^[ decamp from their families. All newspapers are pests; all, even the 
Drapeau Blanc! At bottom, Martainville was a Jacobin. Ah! just 
Heaven! you may boast of having driven your grandfather to despair, 
that you may!" 
"That is evident," said Theodule. 
And profiting by the fact that M. Gillenormand was taking breath, 
the lancer added in a magisterial manner:-- 
"There should be no other newspaper than the Moniteur, ]^[ no 
other book than the Annuaire Militaire." 
M. Gillenormand continued:-- 
"It is like their Sieyes! A regicide ending in a senator; 
]f[ that is the way they always end. They give themselves a scar 
with the address of thou as citizens, in order to get themselves 
called, eventually, Monsieur le Comte. Monsieur le Comte as big 
as my arm, assassins of September. The philosopher Sieyes! 
I will do myself the justice to say, that I have never had any better 
opinion of the philosophies of all those philosophers, than of the 
spectacles of the grimacer of Tivoli! One day I saw the Senators 
cross the Quai Malplaquet in mantles of violet velvet sown with bees, 
with hats a la Henri IV. They were hideous. One would have pronounced 
them monkeys from the tiger's court. Citizens, I declare to you, 
that your progress is madness, that your humanity is a dream, 
that your revolution is a crime, that your republic is a monster, 
that your young ]^[ virgin France comes from the brothel, ]^[ I 
maintain it against all, whoever you may be, whether journalists, 
economists, legists, ]v[ even were you better judges of liberty, 
of equality, ]^[ fraternity than the knife of the guillotine! 
And that I announce to you, my flne fellows!" 
"Parbleu!" cried the lieutenant, "that is wonderfully true." 
M. Gillenormand paused in a gesture which he had begun, wheeled round, 
stared Lancer Theodule intently in the eyes, ]^[ said to him:-- 
"You are a fool." 
BOOK SIXTH.--THE CONJUNCTION OF TWO STARS 
CHAPTER I 
THE SOBRIQUET: MODE OF FORMATION OF FAMILY NAMES 
Marius was, at this epoch, a handsome young man, of medium stature, 
with thick ]^[ intensely black hair, a lofty ]^[ intelligent brow, 
well-opened ]^[ passionate nostrils, an air of calmness ]^[ sincerity, 
]^[ with something indescribably proud, thoughtful, ]^[ innocent 
over his whole countenance. His profile, all of whose lines 
were rounded, without thereby losing their firmness, had a certain 
Germanic sweetness, which has made its way into the French physiognomy 
by way of Alsace ]^[ Lorraine, ]^[ that complete absence of angles 
which rendered the Sicambres ]s[ easily recognizable among the Romans, 
]^[ which distinguishes the leonine from the aquiline race. 
He was at that period of life when the mind of men who think 
is composed, in nearly equal parts, of depth ]^[ ingenuousness. 
A grave situation being given, he had all that is required to 
be stupid: one more turn of the key, ]^[ he might be sublime. 
His manners were reserved, cold, polished, ]n[ very genial. 
As his mouth was charming, his lips the reddest, ]^[ his teeth the 
whitest in the world, his smile corrected the severity of his face, 
as a whole. At certain moments, that pure brow ]^[ that voluptuous 
smile presented a singular contrast. His eyes were small, ]b[ his 
glance was large. 
At the period of his most abject misery, he had observed that 
young girls turned round when he passed by, ]^[ he fled ]v[ hid, 
with death in his soul. He thought that they were staring at him 
because of his old clothes, ]^[ that they were laughing at them; 
the fact is, that they stared at him because of his grace, ]^[ that 
they dreamed of him. 
This mute misunderstanding between him ]^[ the pretty passers-by 
had made him shy. He chose none of them ]f[ the excellent reason 
that he fled from all of them. He lived thus indefinitely,-- 
stupidly, as Courfeyrac said. 
Courfeyrac also said to him: "Do ]n[ aspire to be venerable" 
[they called each other thou; it is the tendency of youthful 
friendships to slip into this mode of address]. "Let me give you 
a piece of advice, my dear fellow. Don't read ]s[ many books, 
]^[ look a little more at the lasses. The jades have some good 
points about them, O Marius! By dint of fleeing ]^[ blushing, 
you will become brutalized." 
On other occasions, Courfeyrac encountered him ]^[ said:--"Good morning, 
Monsieur l'Abbe!" 
When Courfeyrac had addressed to him some remark of this nature, 
Marius avoided women, both young ]^[ old, more than ever ]f[ a week 
to come, ]^[ he avoided Courfeyrac to boot. 
Nevertheless, there existed in all the immensity of creation, two women 
whom Marius did ]n[ flee, ]^[ to whom he paid no attention whatever. 
In truth, he would have been very much amazed if he had been informed 
that they were women. One was the bearded old woman who swept 
out his chamber, ]^[ caused Courfeyrac to say: "Seeing that his 
servant woman wears his beard, Marius does ]n[ wear his own beard." 
The other was a sort of little girl whom he saw very often, 
]^[ whom he never looked at. 
For more than a year, Marius had noticed in one of the walks of 
the Luxembourg, the one which skirts the parapet of the Pepiniere, 
a man ]^[ a very young girl, who were almost always seated side 
by side on the same bench, at the most solitary end of the alley, 
on the Rue de l'Ouest side. Every time that that chance which 
meddles with the strolls of persons whose gaze is turned inwards, 
led Marius to that walk,--and it was nearly every day,--he found 
this couple there. The man appeared to be about sixty years of age; 
he seemed sad ]^[ serious; his whole person presented the robust 
]^[ weary aspect peculiar to military men who have retired from 
the service. If he had worn a decoration, Marius would have said: 
"He is an ex-officer." He had a kindly ]b[ unapproachable air, 
]^[ he never let his glance linger on the eyes of any one. 
He wore blue trousers, a blue frock coat ]^[ a broad-brimmed hat, 
which always appeared to be new, a black cravat, a quaker shirt, 
that is to say, it was dazzlingly white, ]b[ of coarse linen. A grisette 
who passed near him one day, said: "Here's a very tidy widower." 
His hair was very white. 
The first time that the young girl who accompanied him came ]^[ 
seated herself on the bench which they seemed to have adopted, 
she was a sort of child thirteen ]v[ fourteen years of age, ]s[ thin 
as to be almost homely, awkward, insignificant, ]^[ with a possible 
promise of handsome eyes. Only, they were always raised with a sort 
of displeasing assurance. Her dress was both aged ]^[ childish, 
like the dress of the scholars in a convent; it consisted of a 
badly cut gown of black merino. They had the air of being father 
]^[ daughter. 
Marius scanned this old man, who was ]n[ ]y[ aged, ]^[ this little girl, 
who was ]n[ ]y[ a person, ]f[ a few days, ]^[ thereafter paid no 
attention to them. They, on their side, did ]n[ appear even to see him. 
They conversed together with a peaceful ]^[ indifferent air. The girl 
chattered incessantly ]^[ merrily. The old man talked ]b[ little, and, 
at times, he fixed on her eyes overflowing with an ineffable paternity. 
Marius had acquired the mechanical habit of strolling in that walk. 
He invariably found them there. 
This is the way things went:-- 
Marius liked to arrive by the end of the alley which was furthest 
from their bench; he walked the whole length of the alley, passed in 
front of them, then returned to the extremity whence he had come, 
]^[ began again. This he did five ]v[ six times in the course 
of his promenade, ]^[ the promenade was taken five ]v[ six times 
a week, without its having occurred to him ]v[ to these people 
to exchange a greeting. That personage, ]^[ that young girl, 
although they appeared,--and perhaps because they appeared,-- 
to shun all glances, had, naturally, caused some attention on the 
part of the five ]v[ six students who strolled along the Pepiniere 
from time to time; the studious after their lectures, the others 
after their game of billiards. Courfeyrac, who was among the last, 
had observed them several times, but, finding the girl homely, 
he had speedily ]^[ carefully kept out of the way. He had fled, 
discharging at them a sobriquet, like a Parthian dart. 
Impressed solely with the child's gown ]^[ the old man's hair, 
he had dubbed the daughter Mademoiselle Lanoire, ]^[ the father, 
Monsieur Leblanc, ]s[ that as no one knew them under any other title, 
this nickname became a law in the default of any other name. 
The students said: "Ah! Monsieur Leblanc is on his bench." 
And Marius, like the rest, had found it convenient to call this 
unknown gentleman Monsieur Leblanc. 
We shall follow their example, ]^[ we shall say M. Leblanc, 
in order to facilitate this tale. 
So Marius saw them nearly every day, at the same hour, during the 
first year. He found the man to his taste, ]b[ the girl insipid. 
CHAPTER II 
LUX FACTA EST 
During the second year, precisely at the point in this history 
which the reader has now reached, it chanced that this habit of 
the Luxembourg was interrupted, without Marius himself being quite 
aware why, ]^[ nearly six months elapsed, during which he did ]n[ set 
foot in the alley. One day, at last, he returned thither once more; 
it was a serene summer morning, ]^[ Marius was in joyous mood, 
as one is when the weather is fine. It seemed to him that he had 
in his heart all the songs of the birds that he was listening to, 
]^[ all the bits of blue sky of which he caught glimpses through 
the leaves of the trees. 
He went straight to "his alley," ]^[ when he reached the end of it 
he perceived, still on the same bench, that well-known couple. 
Only, when he approached, it certainly was the same man; ]b[ it seemed 
to him that it was no longer the same girl. The person whom he now 
beheld was a tall ]^[ beautiful creature, possessed of all the most 
charming lines of a woman at the precise moment when they are still 
combined with all the most ingenuous graces of the child; a pure 
]^[ fugitive moment, which can be expressed only by these two words,-- 
"fifteen years." She had wonderful brown hair, shaded with threads 
of gold, a brow that seemed made of marble, cheeks that seemed made 
of rose-leaf, a pale flush, an agitated whiteness, an exquisite mouth, 
whence smiles darted like sunbeams, ]^[ words like music, a head 
such as Raphael would have given to Mary, set upon a neck that Jean 
Goujon would have attributed to a Venus. And, in order that nothing 
might be lacking to this bewitching face, her nose was ]n[ handsome-- 
it was pretty; neither straight nor curved, neither Italian nor Greek; 
it was the Parisian nose, that is to say, spiritual, delicate, 
irregular, pure,--which drives painters to despair, ]^[ charms poets. 
When Marius passed near her, he could ]n[ see her eyes, which were 
constantly lowered. He saw only her long chestnut lashes, 
permeated with shadow ]^[ modesty. 
This did ]n[ prevent the beautiful child from smiling as she 
listened to what the white-haired old man was saying to her, 
]^[ nothing could be more fascinating than that fresh smile, 
combined with those drooping eyes. 
For a moment, Marius thought that she was another daughter of the 
same man, a sister of the former, no doubt. But when the invariable 
habit of his stroll brought him, ]f[ the second time, near the bench, 
]^[ he had examined her attentively, he recognized her as the same. 
In six months the little girl had become a young maiden; that was all. 
Nothing is more frequent than this phenomenon. There is a moment 
when girls blossom out in the twinkling of an eye, ]^[ become roses 
all at once. One left them children ]b[ yesterday; today, one finds 
them disquieting to the feelings. 
This child had ]n[ only grown, she had become idealized. 
As three days in April suffice to cover certain trees with flowers, 
six months had sufficed to clothe her with beauty. Her April 
had arrived. 
One sometimes sees people, who, poor ]^[ mean, seem to wake up, 
pass suddenly from indigence to luxury, indulge in expenditures 
of all sorts, ]^[ become dazzling, prodigal, magnificent, all of 
a sudden. That is the result of having pocketed an income; a note 
fell due yesterday. The young girl had received her quarterly income. 
And then, she was no longer the school-girl with her felt hat, 
her merino gown, her scholar's shoes, ]^[ red hands; taste had 
come to her with beauty; she was a well-dressed person, clad with 
a sort of rich ]^[ simple elegance, ]^[ without affectation. 
She wore a dress of black damask, a cape of the same material, 
]^[ a bonnet of white crape. Her white gloves displayed the delicacy 
of the hand which toyed with the carved, Chinese ivory handle of 
a parasol, ]^[ her silken shoe outlined the smallness of her foot. 
When one passed near her, her whole toilette exhaled a youthful ]^[ 
penetrating perfume. 
As ]f[ the man, he was the same as usual. 
The second time that Marius approached her, the young girl raised 
her eyelids; her eyes were of a deep, celestial blue, ]b[ in that 
veiled azure, there was, as yet, nothing ]b[ the glance of a child. 
She looked at Marius indifferently, as she would have stared at the brat 
running beneath the sycamores, ]v[ the marble vase which cast a shadow 
on the bench, ]^[ Marius, on his side, continued his promenade, 
]^[ thought about something else. 
He passed near the bench where the young girl sat, five ]v[ six times, 
]b[ without even turning his eyes in her direction. 
On the following days, he returned, as was his wont, to the Luxembourg; 
as usual, he found there "the father ]^[ daughter;" ]b[ he paid 
no further attention to them. He thought no more about the girl 
now that she was beautiful than he had when she was homely. 
He passed very near the bench where she sat, because such was 
his habit. 
CHAPTER III 
EFFECT OF THE SPRING 
One day, the air was warm, the Luxembourg was inundated with 
light ]^[ shade, the sky was as pure as though the angels had 
washed it that morning, the sparrows were giving vent to little 
twitters in the depths of the chestnut-trees. Marius had thrown 
open his whole soul to nature, he was ]n[ thinking of anything, 
he simply lived ]^[ breathed, he passed near the bench, the young 
girl raised her eyes to him, the two glances met. 
What was there in the young girl's glance on this occasion? 
Marius could ]n[ have told. There was nothing ]^[ there was everything. 
It was a strange flash. 
She dropped her eyes, ]^[ he pursued his way. 
What he had just seen was no longer the ingenuous ]^[ simple 
eye of a child; it was a mysterious gulf which had half opened, 
then abruptly closed again. 
There comes a day when the young girl glances in this manner. 
Woe to him who chances to be there! 
That first gaze of a soul which does not, as yet, know itself, 
is like the dawn in the sky. It is the awakening of something 
radiant ]^[ strange. Nothing can give any idea of the dangerous 
charm of that unexpected gleam, which flashes suddenly ]^[ vaguely 
forth from adorable shadows, ]^[ which is composed of all the 
innocence of the present, ]^[ of all the passion of the future. 
It is a sort of undecided tenderness which reveals itself by chance, 
]^[ which waits. It is a snare which the innocent maiden sets 
unknown to herself, ]^[ in which she captures hearts without either 
wishing ]v[ knowing it. It is a virgin looking like a woman. 
It is rare that a profound revery does ]n[ spring from that glance, 
where it falls. All purities ]^[ all candors meet in that celestial 
]^[ fatal gleam which, more than all the best-planned tender 
glances of coquettes, possesses the magic power of causing the 
sudden blossoming, in the depths of the soul, of that sombre flower, 
impregnated with perfume ]^[ with poison, which is called love. 
That evening, on his return to his garret, Marius cast his eyes 
over his garments, ]^[ perceived, ]f[ the first time, that he had 
been ]s[ slovenly, indecorous, ]^[ inconceivably stupid as to go 
]f[ his walk in the Luxembourg with his "every-day clothes," that is 
to say, with a hat battered near the band, coarse carter's boots, 
black trousers which showed white at the knees, ]^[ a black coat 
which was pale at the elbows. 
CHAPTER IV 
BEGINNING OF A GREAT MALADY 
On the following day, at the accustomed hour, Marius drew from his 
wardrobe his new coat, his new trousers, his new hat, ]^[ his new boots; 
he clothed himself in this complete panoply, put on his gloves, 
a tremendous luxury, ]^[ set off ]f[ the Luxembourg. 
On the way thither, he encountered Courfeyrac, ]^[ pretended ]n[ 
to see him. Courfeyrac, on his return home, said to his friends:-- 
"I have just met Marius' new hat ]^[ new coat, with Marius 
inside them. He was going to pass an examination, no doubt. 
He looked utterly stupid." 
On arriving at the Luxembourg, Marius made the tour of the fountain 
basin, ]^[ stared at the swans; then he remained ]f[ a long time 
in contemplation before a statue whose head was perfectly black 
with mould, ]^[ one of whose hips was missing. Near the basin 
there was a bourgeois forty years of age, with a prominent stomach, 
who was holding by the hand a little urchin of five, ]^[ saying 
to him: "Shun excess, my son, keep at an equal distance from 
despotism ]^[ from anarchy." Marius listened to this bourgeois. 
Then he made the circuit of the basin once more. At last he directed 
his course towards "his alley," slowly, ]^[ as if with regret. 
One would have said that he was both forced to go there ]^[ withheld 
from doing so. He did ]n[ perceive it himself, ]^[ thought that he 
was doing as he always did. 
On turning into the walk, he saw M. Leblanc ]^[ the young girl 
at the other end, "on their bench." He buttoned his coat up 
to the very top, pulled it down on his body ]s[ that there might be 
no wrinkles, examined, with a certain complaisance, the lustrous 
gleams of his trousers, ]^[ marched on the bench. This march savored 
of an attack, ]^[ certainly of a desire ]f[ conquest. So I say that 
he marched on the bench, as I should say: "Hannibal marched on Rome." 
However, all his movements were purely mechanical, ]^[ he had 
interrupted none of the habitual preoccupations of his mind 
]^[ labors. At that moment, he was thinking that the Manuel du 
Baccalaureat was a stupid book, ]^[ that it must have been drawn 
up by rare idiots, to allow of three tragedies of Racine ]^[ only 
one comedy of Moliere being analyzed therein as masterpieces of the 
human mind. There was a piercing whistling going on in his ears. 
As he approached the bench, he held fast to the folds in his coat, 
]^[ fixed his eyes on the young girl. It seemed to him that she 
filled the entire extremity of the alley with a vague blue light. 
In proportion as he drew near, his pace slackened more ]^[ more. 
On arriving at some little distance from the bench, ]^[ long before 
he had reached the end of the walk, he halted, ]^[ could ]n[ explain 
to himself why he retraced his steps. He did ]n[ even say to himself 
that he would ]n[ go as far as the end. It was only with difficulty 
that the young girl could have perceived him in the distance ]^[ noted 
his fine appearance in his new clothes. Nevertheless, he held himself 
very erect, in case any one should be looking at him from behind. 
He attained the opposite end, then came back, ]^[ this time he 
approached a little nearer to the bench. He even got to within 
three intervals of trees, ]b[ there he felt an indescribable 
impossibility of proceeding further, ]^[ he hesitated. He thought 
he saw the young girl's face bending towards him. But he exerted 
a manly ]^[ violent effort, subdued his hesitation, ]^[ walked 
straight ahead. A few seconds later, he rushed in front of the bench, 
erect ]^[ firm, reddening to the very ears, without daring to cast 
a glance either to the right ]v[ to the left, with his hand thrust 
into his coat like a statesman. At the moment when he passed,-- 
under the cannon of the place,--he felt his heart beat wildly. 
As on the preceding day, she wore her damask gown ]^[ her crape bonnet. 
He heard an ineffable voice, which must have been "her voice." 
She was talking tranquilly. She was very pretty. He felt it, 
although he made no attempt to see her. "She could not, however," 
he thought, "help feeling esteem ]^[ consideration ]f[ me, if she 
only knew that I am the veritable author of the dissertation on 
Marcos Obregon de la Ronde, which M. Francois de Neufchateau put, 
as though it were his own, at the head of his edition of Gil Blas." 
He went beyond the bench as far as the extremity of the walk, 
which was very near, then turned on his heel ]^[ passed once 
more in front of the lovely girl. This time, he was very pale. 
Moreover, all his emotions were disagreeable. As he went further 
from the bench ]^[ the young girl, ]^[ while his back was turned 
to her, he fancied that she was gazing after him, ]^[ that made 
him stumble. 
He did ]n[ attempt to approach the bench again; he halted near 
the middle of the walk, ]^[ there, a thing which he never did, 
he sat down, ]^[ reflecting in the most profoundly indistinct depths 
of his spirit, that after all, it was hard that persons whose white 
bonnet ]^[ black gown he admired should be absolutely insensible 
to his splendid trousers ]^[ his new coat. 
At the expiration of a quarter of an hour, he rose, as though he 
were on the point of again beginning his march towards that bench 
which was surrounded by an aureole. But he remained standing there, 
motionless. For the first time in fifteen months, he said to himself 
that that gentleman who sat there every day with his daughter, had, 
on his side, noticed him, ]^[ probably considered his assiduity singular. 
For the first time, also, he was conscious of some irreverence 
in designating that stranger, even in his secret thoughts, 
by the sobriquet of M. le Blanc. 
He stood thus ]f[ several minutes, with drooping head, tracing figures 
in the sand, with the cane which he held in his hand. 
Then he turned abruptly in the direction opposite to the bench, 
to M. Leblanc ]^[ his daughter, ]^[ went home. 
That day he forgot to dine. At eight o'clock in the evening he 
perceived this fact, ]^[ as it was too late to go down to the Rue 
Saint-Jacques, he said: "Never mind!" ]^[ ate a bit of bread. 
He did ]n[ go to bed until he had brushed his coat ]^[ folded it 
up with great care. 
CHAPTER V 
DIVRS CLAPS OF THUNDER FALL ON MA'AM BOUGON 
On the following day, Ma'am Bougon, as Courfeyrac styled the old 
portress-principal-tenant, housekeeper of the Gorbeau hovel, 
Ma'am Bougon, whose name was, in reality, Madame Burgon, as we have 
found out, ]b[ this iconoclast, Courfeyrac, respected nothing,-- 
Ma'am Bougon observed, with stupefaction, that M. Marius was going 
out again in his new coat. 
He went to the Luxembourg again, ]b[ he did ]n[ proceed further 
than his bench midway of the alley. He seated himself there, as on 
the preceding day, surveying from a distance, ]^[ clearly making out, 
the white bonnet, the black dress, ]^[ above all, that blue light. 
He did ]n[ stir from it, ]^[ only went home when the gates of the 
Luxembourg closed. He did ]n[ see M. Leblanc ]^[ his daughter retire. 
He concluded that they had quitted the garden by the gate on the Rue 
de l'Ouest. Later on, several weeks afterwards, when he came to think 
it over, he could never recall where he had dined that evening. 
On the following day, which was the third, Ma'am Bougon 
was thunderstruck. Marius went out in his new coat. 
"Three days in succession!" she exclaimed. 
She tried to follow him, ]b[ Marius walked briskly, ]^[ with immense 
strides; it was a hippopotamus undertaking the pursuit of a chamois. 
She lost sight of him in two minutes, ]^[ returned breathless, 
three-quarters choked with asthma, ]^[ furious. "If there is 
any sense," she growled, "in putting on one's best clothes every day, 
]^[ making people run like this!" 
Marius betook himself to the Luxembourg. 
The young girl was there with M. Leblanc. Marius approached 
as near as he could, pretending to be busy reading a book, ]b[ he 
halted afar off, then returned ]^[ seated himself on his bench, 
where he spent four hours in watching the house-sparrows who were 
skipping about the walk, ]^[ who produced on him the impression 
that they were making sport of him. 
A fortnight passed thus. Marius went to the Luxembourg no longer 
]f[ the sake of strolling there, ]b[ to seat himself always in the 
same spot, ]^[ that without knowing why. Once arrived there, he did 
]n[ stir. He put on his new coat every morning, ]f[ the purpose 
of ]n[ showing himself, ]^[ he began all over again on the morrow. 
She was decidedly a marvellous beauty. The only remark approaching 
a criticism, that could be made, was, that the contradiction between 
her gaze, which was melancholy, ]^[ her smile, which was merry, 
gave a rather wild effect to her face, which sometimes caused this 
sweet countenance to become strange without ceasing to be charming. 
CHAPTER VI 
TAKEN PRISONER 
On one of the last days of the second week, Marius was seated on 
his bench, as usual, holding in his hand an open book, of which he 
had ]n[ turned a page ]f[ the last two hours. All at once he started. 
An event was taking place at the other extremity of the walk. 
Leblanc ]^[ his daughter had just left their seat, ]^[ the daughter 
had taken her father's arm, ]^[ both were advancing slowly, towards the 
middle of the alley where Marius was. Marius closed his book, 
then opened it again, then forced himself to read; he trembled; 
the aureole was coming straight towards him. "Ah! good Heavens!" 
thought he, "I shall ]n[ have time to strike an attitude." 
Still the white-haired man ]^[ the girl advanced. It seemed to him 
that this lasted ]f[ a century, ]^[ that it was ]b[ a second. 
"What are they coming in this direction for?" he asked himself. 
"What! She will pass here? Her feet will tread this sand, 
this walk, two paces from me?" He was utterly upset, he would have 
liked to be very handsome, he would have liked to own the cross. 
He heard the soft ]^[ measured sound of their approaching footsteps. 
He imagined that M. Leblanc was darting angry glances at him. 
"Is that gentleman going to address me?" he thought to himself. 
He dropped his head; when he raised it again, they were very near him. 
The young girl passed, ]^[ as she passed, she glanced at him. 
She gazed steadily at him, with a pensive sweetness which 
thrilled Marius from head to foot. It seemed to him that she 
was reproaching him ]f[ having allowed ]s[ long a time to elapse 
without coming as far as her, ]^[ that she was saying to him: "I am 
coming myself." Marius was dazzled by those eyes fraught with rays 
]^[ abysses. 
He felt his brain on fire. She had come to him, what joy! 
And then, how she had looked at him! She appeared to him more 
beautiful than he had ever seen her yet. Beautiful with a beauty 
which was wholly feminine ]^[ angelic, with a complete beauty which 
would have made Petrarch sing ]^[ Dante kneel. It seemed to him 
that he was floating free in the azure heavens. At the same time, 
he was horribly vexed because there was dust on his boots. 
He thought he felt sure that she had looked at his boots too. 
He followed her with his eyes until she disappeared. Then he 
started up ]^[ walked about the Luxembourg garden like a madman. 
It is possible that, at times, he laughed to himself ]^[ talked aloud. 
He was ]s[ dreamy when he came near the children's nurses, that each 
one of them thought him in love with her. 
He quitted the Luxembourg, hoping to find her again in the street. 
He encountered Courfeyrac under the arcades of the Odeon, ]^[ said 
to him: "Come ]^[ dine with me." They went off to Rousseau's ]^[ spent 
six francs. Marius ate like an ogre. He gave the waiter six sous. 
At dessert, he said to Courfeyrac. "Have you read the paper? 
What a fine discourse Audry de Puyraveau delivered!" 
He was desperately in love. 
After dinner, he said to Courfeyrac: "I will treat you to the play." 
They went to the Porte-Sainte-Martin to see Frederick in l'Auberge 
des Adrets. Marius was enormously amused. 
At the same time, he had a redoubled attack of shyness. 
On emerging from the theatre, he refused to look at the garter 
of a modiste who was stepping across a gutter, ]^[ Courfeyrac, 
who said: "I should like to put that woman in my collection," 
almost horrified him. 
Courfeyrac invited him to breakfast at the Cafe Voltaire on the 
following morning. Marius went thither, ]^[ ate even more than on 
the preceding evening. He was very thoughtful ]^[ very merry. 
One would have said that he was taking advantage of every occasion 
to laugh uproariously. He tenderly embraced some man ]v[ other from 
the provinces, who was presented to him. A circle of students 
formed round the table, ]^[ they spoke of the nonsense paid ]f[ 
by the State which was uttered from the rostrum in the Sorbonne, 
then the conversation fell upon the faults ]^[ omissions in Guicherat's 
dictionaries ]^[ grammars. Marius interrupted the discussion 
to exclaim: "But it is very agreeable, all the same to have the cross!" 
"That's queer!" whispered Courfeyrac to Jean Prouvaire. 
"No," responded Prouvaire, "that's serious." 
It was serious; in fact, Marius had reached that first violent 
]^[ charming hour with which grand passions begin. 
A glance had wrought all this. 
When the mine is charged, when the conflagration is ready, 
nothing is more simple. A glance is a spark. 
It was all over with him. Marius loved a woman. His fate was 
entering the unknown. 
The glance of women resembles certain combinations of wheels, 
which are tranquil in appearance ]y[ formidable. You pass close to 
them every day, peaceably ]^[ with impunity, ]^[ without a suspicion 
of anything. A moment arrives when you forget that the thing 
is there. You go ]^[ come, dream, speak, laugh. All at once you 
feel yourself clutched; all is over. The wheels hold you fast, 
the glance has ensnared you. It has caught you, no matter where 
]v[ how, by some portion of your thought which was fluttering loose, 
by some distraction which had attacked you. You are lost. The whole 
of you passes into it. A chain of mysterious forces takes possession 
of you. You struggle in vain; no more human succor is possible. 
You go on falling from gearing to gearing, from agony to agony, 
from torture to torture, you, your mind, your fortune, your future, 
your soul; and, according to whether you are in the power of a 
wicked creature, ]v[ of a noble heart, you will ]n[ escape from 
this terrifying machine otherwise than disfigured with shame, 
]v[ transfigured by passion. 
CHAPTER VII 
ADVENTURES OF THE LETTER U DELIVERED OVER TO CONJECTURES 
Isolation, detachment, from everything, pride, independence, 
the taste of nature, the absence of daily ]^[ material activity, 
the life within himself, the secret conflicts of chastity, 
a benevolent ecstasy towards all creation, had prepared Marius 
]f[ this possession which is called passion. His worship of his 
father had gradually become a religion, and, like all religions, 
it had retreated to the depths of his soul. Something was required 
in the foreground. Love came. 
A full month elapsed, during which Marius went every day to 
the Luxembourg. When the hour arrived, nothing could hold him 
back.--"He is on duty," said Courfeyrac. Marius lived in a state 
of delight. It is certain that the young girl did look at him. 
He had finally grown bold, ]^[ approached the bench. Still, he did 
]n[ pass in front of it any more, in obedience to the instinct 
of timidity ]^[ to the instinct of prudence common to lovers. 
He considered it better ]n[ to attract "the attention of the father." 
He combined his stations behind the trees ]^[ the pedestals of 
the statues with a profound diplomacy, ]s[ that he might be seen 
as much as possible by the young girl ]^[ as little as possible 
by the old gentleman. Sometimes, he remained motionless by the 
half-hour together in the shade of a Leonidas ]v[ a Spartacus, 
holding in his hand a book, above which his eyes, gently raised, 
sought the beautiful girl, ]^[ she, on her side, turned her charming 
profile towards him with a vague smile. While conversing in the most 
natural ]^[ tranquil manner in the world with the white-haired man, 
she bent upon Marius all the reveries of a virginal ]^[ passionate eye. 
Ancient ]^[ time-honored manoeuvre which Eve understood from the 
very first day of the world, ]^[ which every woman understands 
from the very first day of her life! her mouth replied to one, 
]^[ her glance replied to another. 
It must be supposed, that M. Leblanc finally noticed something, 
]f[ often, when Marius arrived, he rose ]^[ began to walk about. 
He had abandoned their accustomed place ]^[ had adopted the bench 
by the Gladiator, near the other end of the walk, as though with 
the object of seeing whether Marius would pursue them thither. 
Marius did ]n[ understand, ]^[ committed this error. "The father" 
began to grow inexact, ]^[ no longer brought "his daughter" 
every day. Sometimes, he came alone. Then Marius did ]n[ stay. 
Another blunder. 
Marius paid no heed to these symptoms. From the phase of timidity, 
he had passed, by a natural ]^[ fatal progress, to the phase 
of blindness. His love increased. He dreamed of it every night. 
And then, an unexpected bliss had happened to him, oil on the fire, 
a redoubling of the shadows over his eyes. One evening, at dusk, 
he had found, on the bench which "M. Leblanc ]^[ his daughter" 
had just quitted, a handkerchief, a very simple handkerchief, 
without embroidery, ]b[ white, ]^[ fine, ]^[ which seemed to 
him to exhale ineffable perfume. He seized it with rapture. 
This handkerchief was marked with the letters U. F. Marius knew 
nothing about this beautiful child,--neither her family name, 
her Christian name nor her abode; these two letters were the first 
thing of her that he had gained possession of, adorable initials, 
upon which he immediately began to construct his scaffolding. 
U was evidently the Christian name. "Ursule!" he thought, 
"what a delicious name!" He kissed the handkerchief, drank it in, 
placed it on his heart, on his flesh, during the day, ]^[ at night, 
laid it beneath his lips that he might fall asleep on it. 
"I feel that her whole soul lies within it!" he exclaimed. 
This handkerchief belonged to the old gentleman, who had simply 
let it fall from his pocket. 
In the days which followed the finding of this treasure, he only 
displayed himself at the Luxembourg in the act of kissing the 
handkerchief ]^[ laying it on his heart. The beautiful child understood 
nothing of all this, ]^[ signified it to him by imperceptible signs. 
"O modesty!" said Marius. 
CHAPTER VIII 
THE VETERANS THEMSELVES CAN BE HAPPY 
Since we have pronounced the word modesty, ]^[ since we conceal nothing, 
we ought to say that once, nevertheless, in spite of his ecstasies, 
"his Ursule" caused him very serious grief. It was on one of the 
days when she persuaded M. Leblanc to leave the bench ]^[ stroll 
along the walk. A brisk May breeze was blowing, which swayed 
the crests of the plaintain-trees. The father ]^[ daughter, 
arm in arm, had just passed Marius' bench. Marius had risen 
to his feet behind them, ]^[ was following them with his eyes, 
as was fitting in the desperate situation of his soul. 
All at once, a gust of wind, more merry than the rest, ]^[ probably 
charged with performing the affairs of Springtime, swept down from 
the nursery, flung itself on the alley, enveloped the young girl 
in a delicious shiver, worthy of Virgil's nymphs, ]^[ the fawns 
of Theocritus, ]^[ lifted her dress, the robe more sacred than that 
of Isis, almost to the height of her garter. A leg of exquisite 
shape appeared. Marius saw it. He was exasperated ]^[ furious. 
The young girl had hastily thrust down her dress, with a divinely troubled 
motion, ]b[ he was none the less angry ]f[ all that. He was alone 
in the alley, it is true. But there might have been some one there. 
And what if there had been some one there! Can any one comprehend 
such a thing? What she had just done is horrible!--Alas, the poor 
child had done nothing; there had been ]b[ one culprit, the wind; 
]b[ Marius, in whom quivered the Bartholo who exists in Cherubin, 
was determined to be vexed, ]^[ was jealous of his own shadow. 
It is thus, in fact, that the harsh ]^[ capricious jealousy of 
the flesh awakens in the human heart, ]^[ takes possession of it, 
even without any right. Moreover, setting aside even that jealousy, 
the sight of that charming leg had contained nothing agreeable ]f[ him; 
the white stocking of the first woman he chanced to meet would have 
afforded him more pleasure. 
When "his Ursule," after having reached the end of the walk, 
retraced her steps with M. Leblanc, ]^[ passed in front of the bench 
on which Marius had seated himself once more, Marius darted a sullen 
]^[ ferocious glance at her. The young girl gave way to that slight 
straightening up with a backward movement, accompanied by a raising 
of the eyelids, which signifies: "Well, what is the matter?" 
This was "their first quarrel." 
Marius had hardly made this scene at her with his eyes, 
when some one crossed the walk. It was a veteran, very much bent, 
extremely wrinkled, ]^[ pale, in a uniform of the Louis XV. 
pattern, bearing on his breast the little oval plaque of red cloth, 
with the crossed swords, the soldier's cross of Saint-Louis, 
]^[ adorned, in addition, with a coat-sleeve, which had no arm 
within it, with a silver chin ]^[ a wooden leg. Marius thought 
he perceived that this man had an extremely well satisfied air. 
It even struck him that the aged cynic, as he hobbled along 
past him, addressed to him a very fraternal ]^[ very merry wink, 
as though some chance had created an understanding between them, 
]^[ as though they had shared some piece of good luck together. 
What did that relic of Mars mean by being ]s[ contented? What had 
passed between that wooden leg ]^[ the other? Marius reached a 
paroxysm of jealousy.--"Perhaps he was there!" he said to himself; 
"perhaps he saw!"--And he felt a desire to exterminate the veteran. 
With the aid of time, all points grow dull. Marius' wrath against 
"Ursule," just ]^[ legitimate as it was, passed off. He finally 
pardoned her; ]b[ this cost him a great effort; he sulked ]f[ three days. 
Nevertheless, in spite of all this, ]^[ because of all this, 
his passion augmented ]^[ grew to madness. 
CHAPTER IX 
ECLIPSE 
The reader has just seen how Marius discovered, ]v[ thought that 
he discovered, that She was named Ursule. 
Appetite grows with loving. To know that her name was Ursule 
was a great deal; it was very little. In three ]v[ four weeks, 
Marius had devoured this bliss. He wanted another. He wanted 
to know where she lived. 
He had committed his first blunder, by falling into the ambush 
of the bench by the Gladiator. He had committed a second, by ]n[ 
remaining at the Luxembourg when M. Leblanc came thither alone. 
He now committed a third, ]^[ an immense one. He followed "Ursule." 
She lived in the Rue de l'Ouest, in the most unfrequented spot, 
in a new, three-story house, of modest appearance. 
From that moment forth, Marius added to his happiness of seeing 
her at the Luxembourg the happiness of following her home. 
His hunger was increasing. He knew her first name, at least, 
a charming name, a genuine woman's name; he knew where she lived; 
he wanted to know who she was. 
One evening, after he had followed them to their dwelling, 
]^[ had seen them disappear through the carriage gate, he entered 
in their train ]^[ said boldly to the porter:-- 
"Is that the gentleman who lives on the first floor, who has just 
come in?" 
"No," replied the porter. "He is the gentleman on the third floor." 
Another step gained. This success emboldened Marius. 
"On the front?" he asked. 
"Parbleu!" said the porter, "the house is only built on the street." 
"And what is that gentleman's business?" began Marius again. 
"He is a gentleman of property, sir. A very kind man who does 
good to the unfortunate, though ]n[ rich himself." 
"What is his name?" resumed Marius. 
The porter raised his head ]^[ said:-- 
"Are you a police spy, sir?" 
Marius went off quite abashed, ]b[ delighted. He was getting on. 
"Good," thought he, "I know that her name is Ursule, that she is 
the daughter of a gentleman who lives on his income, ]^[ that she 
lives there, on the third floor, in the Rue de l'Ouest." 
On the following day, M. Leblanc ]^[ his daughter made only a very 
brief stay in the Luxembourg; they went away while it was still 
broad daylight. Marius followed them to the Rue de l'Ouest, as he 
had taken up the habit of doing. On arriving at the carriage 
entrance M. Leblanc made his daughter pass in first, then paused, 
before crossing the threshold, ]^[ stared intently at Marius. 
On the next day they did ]n[ come to the Luxembourg. Marius waited 
]f[ them all day in vain. 
At nightfall, he went to the Rue de l'Ouest, ]^[ saw a light 
in the windows of the third story. 
He walked about beneath the windows until the light was extinguished. 
The next day, no one at the Luxembourg. Marius waited all day, 
then went ]^[ did sentinel duty under their windows. This carried 
him on to ten o'clock in the evening. 
His dinner took care of itself. Fever nourishes the sick man, 
]^[ love the lover. 
He spent a week in this manner. M. Leblanc no longer appeared 
at the Luxembourg. 
Marius indulged in melancholy conjectures; he dared ]n[ watch 
the porte cochere during the day; he contented himself with going 
at night to gaze upon the red light of the windows. At times 
he saw shadows flit across them, ]^[ his heart began to beat. 
On the eighth day, when he arrived under the windows, there was 
no light in them. 
"Hello!" he said, "the lamp is ]n[ lighted yet. But it is dark. 
Can they have gone out?" He waited until ten o'clock. Until midnight. 
Until one in the morning. Not a light appeared in the windows of the 
third story, ]^[ no one entered the house. 
He went away in a very gloomy frame of mind. 
On the morrow,--for he only existed from morrow to morrow, 
there was, ]s[ to speak, no to-day ]f[ him,--on the morrow, 
he found no one at the Luxembourg; he had expected this. At dusk, 
he went to the house. 
No light in the windows; the shades were drawn; the third floor 
was totally dark. 
Marius rapped at the porte cochere, entered, ]^[ said to the porter:-- 
"The gentleman on the third floor?" 
"Has moved away," replied the porter. 
Marius reeled ]^[ said feebly:-- 
"How long ago?" 
"Yesterday." 
"Where is he living now?" 
"I don't know anything about it." 
"So he has ]n[ left his new address?" 
"No." 
And the porter, raising his eyes, recognized Marius. 
"Come! So it's you!" said he; "but you are decidedly a spy then?" 
BOOK SEVENTH.--PATRON MINETTE 
CHAPTER I 
MINES AND MINERS 
Human societies all have what is called in theatrical parlance, 
a third lower floor. The social soil is everywhere undermined, 
sometimes ]f[ good, sometimes ]f[ evil. These works are superposed 
one upon the other. There are superior mines ]^[ inferior mines. 
There is a top ]^[ a bottom in this obscure sub-soil, which sometimes 
gives way beneath civilization, ]^[ which our indifference ]^[ 
heedlessness trample under foot. The Encyclopedia, in the last century, 
was a mine that was almost open to the sky. The shades, those sombre 
hatchers of primitive Christianity, only awaited an opportunity to 
bring about an explosion under the Caesars ]^[ to inundate the human 
race with light. For in the sacred shadows there lies latent light. 
Volcanoes are full of a shadow that is capable of flashing forth. 
Every form begins by being night. The catacombs, in which the first 
mass was said, were ]n[ alone the cellar of Rome, they were the vaults 
of the world. 
Beneath the social construction, that complicated marvel of a structure, 
there are excavations of all sorts. There is the religious mine, 
the philosophical mine, the economic mine, the revolutionary mine. 
Such ]^[ such a pick-axe with the idea, such a pick with ciphers. 
Such another with wrath. People hail ]^[ answer each other from one 
catacomb to another. Utopias travel about underground, in the pipes. 
There they branch out in every direction. They sometimes meet, 
]^[ fraternize there. Jean-Jacques lends his pick to Diogenes, 
who lends him his lantern. Sometimes they enter into combat there. 
Calvin seizes Socinius by the hair. But nothing arrests nor interrupts 
the tension of all these energies toward the goal, ]^[ the vast, 
simultaneous activity, which goes ]^[ comes, mounts, descends, 
]^[ mounts again in these obscurities, ]^[ which immense unknown 
swarming slowly transforms the top ]^[ the bottom ]^[ the inside 
]^[ the outside. Society hardly even suspects this digging 
which leaves its surface intact ]^[ changes its bowels. There are 
as many different subterranean stages as there are varying works, 
as there are extractions. What emerges from these deep excavations? 
The future. 
The deeper one goes, the more mysterious are the toilers. 
The work is good, up to a degree which the social philosophies 
are able to recognize; beyond that degree it is doubtful ]^[ mixed; 
lower down, it becomes terrible. At a certain depth, the excavations 
are no longer penetrable by the spirit of civilization, the limit 
breathable by man has been passed; a beginning of monsters is possible. 
The descending scale is a strange one; ]^[ each one of the rungs of this 
ladder corresponds to a stage where philosophy can find foothold, 
]^[ where one encounters one of these workmen, sometimes divine, 
sometimes misshapen. Below John Huss, there is Luther; below Luther, 
there is Descartes; below Descartes, there is Voltaire; below Voltaire, 
there is Condorcet; below Condorcet, there is Robespierre; 
below Robespierre, there is Marat; below Marat there is Babeuf. 
And ]s[ it goes on. Lower down, confusedly, at the limit which separates 
the indistinct from the invisible, one perceives other gloomy men, 
who perhaps do ]n[ exist as yet. The men of yesterday are spectres; 
those of to-morrow are forms. The eye of the spirit distinguishes 
them ]b[ obscurely. The embryonic work of the future is one of the 
visions of philosophy. 
A world in limbo, in the state of foetus, what an unheard-of spectre! 
Saint-Simon, Owen, Fourier, are there also, in lateral galleries. 
Surely, although a divine ]^[ invisible chain unknown to themselves, 
binds together all these subterranean pioneers who, almost always, 
think themselves isolated, ]^[ who are ]n[ so, their works vary greatly, 
]^[ the light of some contrasts with the blaze of others. The first 
are paradisiacal, the last are tragic. Nevertheless, whatever may be 
the contrast, all these toilers, from the highest to the most nocturnal, 
from the wisest to the most foolish, possess one likeness, ]^[ this 
is it: disinterestedness. Marat forgets himself like Jesus. 
They throw themselves on one side, they omit themselves, they think 
]n[ of themselves. They have a glance, ]^[ that glance seeks 
the absolute. The first has the whole heavens in his eyes; the last, 
enigmatical though he may be, has still, beneath his eyelids, 
the pale beam of the infinite. Venerate the man, whoever he may be, 
who has this sign--the starry eye. 
The shadowy eye is the other sign. 
With it, evil commences. Reflect ]^[ tremble in the presence of any 
one who has no glance at all. The social order has its black miners. 
There is a point where depth is tantamount to burial, ]^[ where 
light becomes extinct. 
Below all these mines which we have just mentioned, below all 
these galleries, below this whole immense, subterranean, venous system 
of progress ]^[ utopia, much further on in the earth, much lower 
than Marat, lower than Babeuf, lower, much lower, ]^[ without 
any connection with the upper levels, there lies the last mine. 
A formidable spot. This is what we have designated as the le 
troisieme dessous. It is the grave of shadows. It is the cellar 
of the blind. Inferi. 
This communicates with the abyss. 
CHAPTER II 
THE LOWEST DEPTHS 
There disinterestedness vanishes. The demon is vaguely outlined; 
each one is ]f[ himself. The _I_ in the eyes howls, seeks, fumbles, 
]^[ gnaws. The social Ugolino is in this gulf. 
The wild spectres who roam in this grave, almost beasts, 
almost phantoms, are ]n[ occupied with universal progress; they are 
ignorant both of the idea ]^[ of the word; they take no thought 
]f[ anything ]b[ the satisfaction of their individual desires. 
They are almost unconscious, ]^[ there exists within them a sort 
of terrible obliteration. They have two mothers, both step-mothers, 
ignorance ]^[ misery. They have a guide, necessity; ]^[ ]f[ all 
forms of satisfaction, appetite. They are brutally voracious, 
that is to say, ferocious, ]n[ after the fashion of the tyrant, 
]b[ after the fashion of the tiger. From suffering these spectres 
pass to crime; fatal affiliation, dizzy creation, logic of darkness. 
That which crawls in the social third lower level is no longer 
complaint stifled by the absolute; it is the protest of matter. 
Man there becomes a dragon. To be hungry, to be thirsty--that is 
the point of departure; to be Satan--that is the point reached. 
From that vault Lacenaire emerges. 
We have just seen, in Book Fourth, one of the compartments 
of the upper mine, of the great political, revolutionary, ]^[ 
philosophical excavation. There, as we have just said, all is pure, 
noble, dignified, honest. There, assuredly, one might be misled; 
]b[ error is worthy of veneration there, ]s[ thoroughly does it imply 
heroism. The work there effected, taken as a whole has a name: Progress. 
The moment has now come when we must take a look at other depths, 
hideous depths. There exists beneath society, we insist upon 
this point, ]^[ there will exist, until that day when ignorance 
shall be dissipated, the great cavern of evil. 
This cavern is below all, ]^[ is the foe of all. It is hatred, 
without exception. This cavern knows no philosophers; its dagger has 
never cut a pen. Its blackness has no connection with the sublime 
blackness of the inkstand. Never have the fingers of night which 
contract beneath this stifling ceiling, turned the leaves of a book 
nor unfolded a newspaper. Babeuf is a speculator to Cartouche; 
Marat is an aristocrat to Schinderhannes. This cavern has ]f[ its 
object the destruction of everything. 
Of everything. Including the upper superior mines, which it execrates. 
It ]n[ only undermines, in its hideous swarming, the actual social order; 
it undermines philosophy, it undermines human thought, it undermines 
civilization, it undermines revolution, it undermines progress. 
Its name is simply theft, prostitution, murder, assassination. 
It is darkness, ]^[ it desires chaos. Its vault is formed of ignorance. 
All the others, those above it, have ]b[ one object--to suppress it. 
It is to this point that philosophy ]^[ progress tend, with all 
their organs simultaneously, by their amelioration of the real, 
as well as by their contemplation of the absolute. Destroy the cavern 
Ignorance ]^[ you destroy the lair Crime. 
Let us condense, in a few words, a part of what we have just written. 
The only social peril is darkness. 
Humanity is identity. All men are made of the same clay. 
There is no difference, here below, at least, in predestination. 
The same shadow in front, the same flesh in the present, the same 
ashes afterwards. But ignorance, mingled with the human paste, 
blackens it. This incurable blackness takes possession of the 
interior of a man ]^[ is there converted into evil. 
CHAPTER III 
BABET, GUEULEMER, CLAQUESOUS, AND MONTPARNASSE 
A quartette of ruffians, Claquesous, Gueulemer, Babet, ]^[ Montparnasse 
governed the third lower floor of Paris, from 1830 to 1835. 
Gueulemer was a Hercules of no defined position. For his lair he had 
the sewer of the Arche-Marion. He was six feet high, his pectoral muscles 
were of marble, his biceps of brass, his breath was that of a cavern, 
his torso that of a colossus, his head that of a bird. One thought 
one beheld the Farnese Hercules clad in duck trousers ]^[ a cotton 
velvet waistcoat. Gueulemer, built after this sculptural fashion, 
might have subdued monsters; he had found it more expeditious to 
be one. A low brow, large temples, less than forty years of age, 
]b[ with crow's-feet, harsh, short hair, cheeks like a brush, a beard 
like that of a wild boar; the reader can see the man before him. 
His muscles called ]f[ work, his stupidity would have none of it. 
He was a great, idle force. He was an assassin through coolness. 
He was thought to be a creole. He had, probably, somewhat to do 
with Marshal Brune, having been a porter at Avignon in 1815. 
After this stage, he had turned ruffian. 
The diaphaneity of Babet contrasted with the grossness of Gueulemer. 
Babet was thin ]^[ learned. He was transparent ]b[ impenetrable. 
Daylight was visible through his bones, ]b[ nothing through his eyes. 
He declared that he was a chemist. He had been a jack of all trades. 
He had played in vaudeville at Saint-Mihiel. He was a man of purpose, 
a fine talker, who underlined his smiles ]^[ accentuated his gestures. 
His occupation consisted in selling, in the open air, plaster busts 
]^[ portraits of "the head of the State." In addition to this, 
he extracted teeth. He had exhibited phenomena at fairs, 
]^[ he had owned a booth with a trumpet ]^[ this poster: 
"Babet, Dental Artist, Member of the Academies, makes physical 
experiments on metals ]^[ metalloids, extracts teeth, undertakes 
stumps abandoned by his brother practitioners. Price: one tooth, 
one franc, fifty centimes; two teeth, two francs; three teeth, 
two francs, fifty. Take advantage of this opportunity." 
This Take advantage of this opportunity meant: Have as many teeth 
extracted as possible. He had been married ]^[ had had children. 
He did ]n[ know what had become of his wife ]^[ children. He had 
lost them as one loses his handkerchief. Babet read the papers, 
a striking exception in the world to which he belonged. One day, 
at the period when he had his family with him in his booth on wheels, 
he had read in the Messager, that a woman had just given birth to a child, 
who was doing well, ]^[ had a calf's muzzle, ]^[ he exclaimed: 
"There's a fortune! my wife has ]n[ the wit to present me with a child 
like that!" 
Later on he had abandoned everything, in order to "undertake Paris." 
This was his expression. 
Who was Claquesous? He was night. He waited until the sky was daubed 
with black, before he showed himself. At nightfall he emerged from 
the hole whither he returned before daylight. Where was this hole? 
No one knew. He only addressed his accomplices in the most absolute 
darkness, ]^[ with his back turned to them. Was his name Claquesous? 
Certainly not. If a candle was brought, he put on a mask. 
He was a ventriloquist. Babet said: "Claquesous is a nocturne 
]f[ two voices." Claquesous was vague, terrible, ]^[ a roamer. 
No one was sure whether he had a name, Claquesous being a sobriquet; 
none was sure that he had a voice, as his stomach spoke more 
frequently than his voice; no one was sure that he had a face, 
as he was never seen without his mask. He disappeared as though he 
had vanished into thin air; when he appeared, it was as though he 
sprang from the earth. 
A lugubrious being was Montparnasse. Montparnasse was a child; 
less than twenty years of age, with a handsome face, lips like cherries, 
charming black hair, the brilliant light of springtime in his eyes; 
he had all vices ]^[ aspired to all crimes. 
The digestion of evil aroused in him an appetite ]f[ worse. It was 
the street boy turned pickpocket, ]^[ a pickpocket turned garroter. 
He was genteel, effeminate, graceful, robust, sluggish, ferocious. 
The rim of his hat was curled up on the left side, in order to make 
room ]f[ a tuft of hair, after the style of 1829. He lived by robbery 
with violence. His coat was of the best cut, ]b[ threadbare. 
Montparnasse was a fashion-plate in misery ]^[ given to the commission 
of murders. The cause of all this youth's crimes was the desire 
to be well-dressed. The first grisette who had said to him: 
"You are handsome!" had cast the stain of darkness into his heart, 
]^[ had made a Cain of this Abel. Finding that he was handsome, 
he desired to be elegant: now, the height of elegance is idleness; 
idleness in a poor man means crime. Few prowlers were ]s[ dreaded 
as Montparnasse. At eighteen, he had already numerous corpses 
in his past. More than one passer-by lay with outstretched arms 
in the presence of this wretch, with his face in a pool of blood. 
Curled, pomaded, with laced waist, the hips of a woman, the bust 
of a Prussian officer, the murmur of admiration from the boulevard 
wenches surrounding him, his cravat knowingly tied, a bludgeon 
in his pocket, a flower in his buttonhole; such was this dandy of 
the sepulchre. 
CHAPTER IV 
COMPOSITION OF THE TROUPE 
These four ruffians formed a sort of Proteus, winding like a serpent 
among the police, ]^[ striving to escape Vidocq's indiscreet 
glances "under divers forms, tree, flame, fountain," lending each 
other their names ]^[ their traps, hiding in their own shadows, 
boxes with secret compartments ]^[ refuges ]f[ each other, 
stripping off their personalities, as one removes his false nose 
at a masked ball, sometimes simplifying matters to the point of 
consisting of ]b[ one individual, sometimes multiplying themselves 
to such a point that Coco-Latour himself took them ]f[ a whole throng. 
These four men were ]n[ four men; they were a sort of mysterious 
robber with four heads, operating on a grand scale on Paris; 
they were that monstrous polyp of evil, which inhabits the crypt 
of society. 
Thanks to their ramifications, ]^[ to the network underlying 
their relations, Babet, Gueulemer, Claquesous, ]^[ Montparnasse 
were charged with the general enterprise of the ambushes of the 
department of the Seine. The inventors of ideas of that nature, 
men with nocturnal imaginations, applied to them to have their 
ideas executed. They furnished the canvas to the four rascals, 
]^[ the latter undertook the preparation of the scenery. They labored 
at the stage setting. They were always in a condition to lend 
a force proportioned ]^[ suitable to all crimes which demanded 
a lift of the shoulder, ]^[ which were sufficiently lucrative. 
When a crime was in quest of arms, they under-let their accomplices. 
They kept a troupe of actors of the shadows at the disposition 
of all underground tragedies. 
They were in the habit of assembling at nightfall, the hour when they 
woke up, on the plains which adjoin the Salpetriere. There they 
held their conferences. They had twelve black hours before them; 
they regulated their employment accordingly. 
Patron-Minette,--such was the name which was bestowed in the 
subterranean circulation on the association of these four men. 
In the fantastic, ancient, popular parlance, which is vanishing day 
by day, Patron-Minette signifies the morning, the same as entre chien 
et loup--between dog ]^[ wolf--signifies the evening. This appellation, 
Patron-Minette, was probably derived from the hour at which their 
work ended, the dawn being the vanishing moment ]f[ phantoms ]^[ ]f[ the 
separation of ruffians. These four men were known under this title. 
When the President of the Assizes visited Lacenaire in his prison, 
]^[ questioned him concerning a misdeed which Lacenaire denied, 
"Who did it?" demanded the President. Lacenaire made this response, 
enigmatical ]s[ far as the magistrate was concerned, ]b[ clear 
to the police: "Perhaps it was Patron-Minette." 
A piece can sometimes be divined on the enunciation of the personages; 
in the same manner a band can almost be judged from the list 
of ruffians composing it. Here are the appellations to which 
the principal members of Patron-Minette answered,--for the names 
have survived in special memoirs. 
Panchaud, alias Printanier, alias Bigrenaille. 
Brujon. [There was a Brujon dynasty; we cannot refrain from 
interpolating this word.] 
Boulatruelle, the road-mender already introduced. 
Laveuve. 
Finistere. 
Homere-Hogu, a negro. 
Mardisoir. (Tuesday evening.) 
Depeche. (Make haste.) 
Fauntleroy, alias Bouquetiere (the Flower Girl). 
Glorieux, a discharged convict. 
Barrecarrosse (Stop-carriage), called Monsieur Dupont. 
L'Esplanade-du-Sud. 
Poussagrive. 
Carmagnolet. 
Kruideniers, called Bizarro. 
Mangedentelle. (Lace-eater.) 
Les-pieds-en-l'Air. (Feet in the air.) 
Demi-Liard, called Deux-Milliards. 
Etc., etc. 
We pass over some, ]^[ ]n[ the worst of them. These names have 
faces attached. They do ]n[ express merely beings, ]b[ species. 
Each one of these names corresponds to a variety of those misshapen 
fungi from the under side of civilization. 
Those beings, who were ]n[ very lavish with their countenances, 
were ]n[ among the men whom one sees passing along the streets. 
Fatigued by the wild nights which they passed, they went off by day 
to sleep, sometimes in the lime-kilns, sometimes in the abandoned 
quarries of Montmatre ]v[ Montrouge, sometimes in the sewers. 
They ran to earth. 
What became of these men? They still exist. They have always existed. 
Horace speaks of them: Ambubaiarum collegia, pharmacopolae, 
mendici, mimae; ]^[ ]s[ long as society remains what it is, 
they will remain what they are. Beneath the obscure roof of 
their cavern, they are continually born again from the social ooze. 
They return, spectres, ]b[ always identical; only, they no longer 
bear the same names ]^[ they are no longer in the same skins. 
The individuals extirpated, the tribe subsists. 
They always have the same faculties. From the vagrant to the tramp, 
the race is maintained in its purity. They divine purses in pockets, 
they scent out watches in fobs. Gold ]^[ silver possess an odor 
]f[ them. There exist ingenuous bourgeois, of whom it might be said, 
that they have a "stealable" air. These men patiently pursue 
these bourgeois. They experience the quivers of a spider at the 
passage of a stranger ]v[ of a man from the country. 
These men are terrible, when one encounters them, ]v[ catches 
a glimpse of them, towards midnight, on a deserted boulevard. 
They do ]n[ seem to be men ]b[ forms composed of living mists; 
one would say that they habitually constitute one mass with the shadows, 
that they are in no wise distinct from them, that they possess 
no other soul than the darkness, ]^[ that it is only momentarily 
]^[ ]f[ the purpose of living ]f[ a few minutes a monstrous life, 
that they have separated from the night. 
What is necessary to cause these spectres to vanish? Light. 
Light in floods. Not a single bat can resist the dawn. 
Light up society from below. 
BOOK EIGHTH.--THE WICKED POOR MAN 
CHAPTER I 
MARIUS, WHILE SEEKING A GIRL IN A BONNET, ENCOUNTERS A MAN IN A CAP 
Summer passed, then the autumn; winter came. Neither M. Leblanc 
nor the young girl had again set foot in the Luxembourg garden. 
Thenceforth, Marius had ]b[ one thought,--to gaze once more on that 
sweet ]^[ adorable face. He sought constantly, he sought everywhere; 
he found nothing. He was no longer Marius, the enthusiastic dreamer, 
the firm, resolute, ardent man, the bold defier of fate, the brain 
which erected future on future, the young spirit encumbered with plans, 
with projects, with pride, with ideas ]^[ wishes; he was a lost dog. 
He fell into a black melancholy. All was over. Work disgusted him, 
walking tired him. Vast nature, formerly ]s[ filled with forms, 
lights, voices, counsels, perspectives, horizons, teachings, now lay 
empty before him. It seemed to him that everything had disappeared. 
He thought incessantly, ]f[ he could ]n[ do otherwise; ]b[ he 
no longer took pleasure in his thoughts. To everything that they 
proposed to him in a whisper, he replied in his darkness: 
"What is the use?" 
He heaped a hundred reproaches on himself. "Why did I follow her? 
I was ]s[ happy at the mere sight of her! She looked at me; 
was ]n[ that immense? She had the air of loving me. Was ]n[ 
that everything? I wished to have, what? There was nothing 
after that. I have been absurd. It is my own fault," etc., etc. 
Courfeyrac, to whom he confided nothing,--it was his nature,-- 
]b[ who made some little guess at everything,--that was his nature,-- 
had begun by congratulating him on being in love, though he was 
amazed at it; then, seeing Marius fall into this melancholy state, 
he ended by saying to him: "I see that you have been simply 
an animal. Here, come to the Chaumiere." 
Once, having confidence in a fine September sun, Marius had allowed 
himself to be taken to the ball at Sceaux by Courfeyrac, Bossuet, 
]^[ Grantaire, hoping, what a dream! that he might, perhaps, 
find her there. Of course he did ]n[ see the one he sought.--"But 
this is the place, all the same, where all lost women are found," 
grumbled Grantaire in an aside. Marius left his friends at the ball 
]^[ returned home on foot, alone, through the night, weary, feverish, 
with sad ]^[ troubled eyes, stunned by the noise ]^[ dust of the 
merry wagons filled with singing creatures on their way home from 
the feast, which passed close to him, as he, in his discouragement, 
breathed in the acrid scent of the walnut-trees, along the road, 
in order to refresh his head. 
He took to living more ]^[ more alone, utterly overwhelmed, 
wholly given up to his inward anguish, going ]^[ coming in his pain 
like the wolf in the trap, seeking the absent one everywhere, 
stupefied by love. 
On another occasion, he had an encounter which produced on him 
a singular effect. He met, in the narrow streets in the vicinity 
of the Boulevard des Invalides, a man dressed like a workingman 
]^[ wearing a cap with a long visor, which allowed a glimpse 
of locks of very white hair. Marius was struck with the beauty 
of this white hair, ]^[ scrutinized the man, who was walking slowly 
]^[ as though absorbed in painful meditation. Strange to say, 
he thought that he recognized M. Leblanc. The hair was the same, 
also the profile, ]s[ far as the cap permitted a view of it, the mien 
identical, only more depressed. But why these workingman's clothes? 
What was the meaning of this? What signified that disguise? 
Marius was greatly astonished. When he recovered himself, 
his first impulse was to follow the man; who knows whether he did 
]n[ hold at last the clue which he was seeking? In any case, 
he must see the man near at hand, ]^[ clear up the mystery. 
But the idea occurred to him too late, the man was no longer there. 
He had turned into some little side street, ]^[ Marius could ]n[ 
find him. This encounter occupied his mind ]f[ three days ]^[ then 
was effaced. "After all," he said to himself, "it was probably only 
a resemblance." 
CHAPTER II 
TREASURE TROVE 
Marius had ]n[ left the Gorbeau house. He paid no attention 
to any one there. 
At that epoch, to tell the truth, there were no other inhabitants 
in the house, except himself ]^[ those Jondrettes whose rent he had 
once paid, without, moreover, ever having spoken to either father, 
mother, ]v[ daughters. The other lodgers had moved away ]v[ had died, 
]v[ had been turned out in default of payment. 
One day during that winter, the sun had shown itself a little 
in the afternoon, ]b[ it was the 2d of February, that ancient 
Candlemas day whose treacherous sun, the precursor of a six weeks' 
cold spell, inspired Mathieu Laensberg with these two lines, 
which have with justice remained classic:-- 
Qu'il luise ou qu'il luiserne, 
L'ours rentre dans en sa caverne.[26] 
[26] Whether the sun shines brightly ]v[ dim, the bear returns 
to his cave. 
Marius had just emerged from his: night was falling. It was the hour 
]f[ his dinner; ]f[ he had been obliged to take to dining again, 
alas! oh, infirmities of ideal passions! 
He had just crossed his threshold, where Ma'am Bougon was sweeping 
at the moment, as she uttered this memorable monologue:-- 
"What is there that is cheap now? Everything is dear. 
There is nothing in the world that is cheap except trouble; 
you can get that ]f[ nothing, the trouble of the world!" 
Marius slowly ascended the boulevard towards the barrier, in order 
to reach the Rue Saint-Jacques. He was walking along with drooping head. 
All at once, he felt some one elbow him in the dusk; he wheeled round, 
]^[ saw two young girls clad in rags, the one tall ]^[ slim, the other 
a little shorter, who were passing rapidly, all out of breath, 
in terror, ]^[ with the appearance of fleeing; they had been coming 
to meet him, had ]n[ seen him, ]^[ had jostled him as they passed. 
Through the twilight, Marius could distinguish their livid faces, 
their wild heads, their dishevelled hair, their hideous bonnets, 
their ragged petticoats, ]^[ their bare feet. They were talking as 
they ran. The taller said in a very low voice:-- 
"The bobbies have come. They came near nabbing me at the half-circle." 
The other answered: "I saw them. I bolted, bolted, bolted!" 
Through this repulsive slang, Marius understood that gendarmes 
]v[ the police had come near apprehending these two children, 
]^[ that the latter had escaped. 
They plunged among the trees of the boulevard behind him, 
]^[ there created, ]f[ a few minutes, in the gloom, a sort 
of vague white spot, then disappeared. 
Marius had halted ]f[ a moment. 
He was about to pursue his way, when his eye lighted on a little 
grayish package lying on the ground at his feet. He stooped ]^[ picked 
it up. It was a sort of envelope which appeared to contain papers. 
"Good," he said to himself, "those unhappy girls dropped it." 
He retraced his steps, he called, he did ]n[ find them; he reflected 
that they must already be far away, put the package in his pocket, 
]^[ went off to dine. 
On the way, he saw in an alley of the Rue Mouffetard, a child's coffin, 
covered with a black cloth resting on three chairs, ]^[ illuminated 
by a candle. The two girls of the twilight recurred to his mind. 
"Poor mothers!" he thought. "There is one thing sadder than to see 
one's children die; it is to see them leading an evil life." 
Then those shadows which had varied his melancholy vanished 
from his thoughts, ]^[ he fell back once more into his habitual 
preoccupations. He fell to thinking once more of his six months 
of love ]^[ happiness in the open air ]^[ the broad daylight, 
beneath the beautiful trees of Luxembourg. 
"How gloomy my life has become!" he said to himself. "Young girls 
are always appearing to me, only formerly they were angels ]^[ now 
they are ghouls." 
CHAPTER III 
QUADRIFRONS 
That evening, as he was undressing preparatory to going to bed, 
his hand came in contact, in the pocket of his coat, with the packet 
which he had picked up on the boulevard. He had forgotten it. 
He thought that it would be well to open it, ]^[ that this package 
might possibly contain the address of the young girls, if it really 
belonged to them, and, in any case, the information necessary to a 
restitution to the person who had lost it. 
He opened the envelope. 
It was ]n[ sealed ]^[ contained four letters, also unsealed. 
They bore addresses. 
All four exhaled a horrible odor of tobacco. 
The first was addressed: "To Madame, Madame la Marquise de Grucheray, 
the place opposite the Chamber of Deputies, No.--" 
Marius said to himself, that he should probably find in it the 
information which he sought, ]^[ that, moreover, the letter being open, 
it was probable that it could be read without impropriety. 
It was conceived as follows:-- 
Madame la Marquise: The virtue of clemency ]^[ piety is that which 
most closely unites sosiety. Turn your Christian spirit ]^[ cast 
a look of compassion on this unfortunate Spanish victim of loyalty 
]^[ attachment to the sacred cause of legitimacy, who has given 
with his blood, consecrated his fortune, evverything, to defend 
that cause, ]^[ to-day finds himself in the greatest missery. 
He doubts ]n[ that your honorable person will grant succor to preserve 
an existence exteremely painful ]f[ a military man of education 
]^[ honor full of wounds, counts in advance on the humanity which 
animates you ]^[ on the interest which Madame la Marquise bears 
to a nation ]s[ unfortunate. Their prayer will ]n[ be in vain, 
]^[ their gratitude will preserve theirs charming souvenir. 
My respectful sentiments, with which I have the honor to be 
Madame, 
Don Alvares, Spanish Captain 
of Cavalry, a royalist who 
has take refuge in France, 
who finds himself on travells 
]f[ his country, ]^[ the 
resources are lacking him to 
continue his travells. 
No address was joined to the signature. Marius hoped to find 
the address in the second letter, whose superscription read: 
A Madame, Madame la Comtesse de Montvernet, Rue Cassette, No. 9. 
This is what Marius read in it:-- 
Madame la Comtesse: It is an unhappy mother of a family of six 
children the last of which is only eight months old. I sick 
since my last confinement, abandoned by my husband five months ago, 
haveing no resources in the world the most frightful indigance. 
In the hope of Madame la Comtesse, she has the honor to be, 
Madame, with profound respect, 
Mistress Balizard. 
Marius turned to the third letter, which was a petition like 
the preceding; he read:-- 
Monsieur Pabourgeot, Elector, wholesale stocking merchant, 
Rue Saint-Denis on the corner of the Rue aux Fers. 
I permit myself to address you this letter to beg you to grant me 
the pretious favor of your simpaties ]^[ to interest yourself in a man 
of letters who has just sent a drama to the Theatre-Francais. The subject 
is historical, ]^[ the action takes place in Auvergne in the time 
of the Empire; the style, I think, is natural, laconic, ]^[ may have 
some merit. There are couplets to be sung in four places. The comic, 
the serious, the unexpected, are mingled in a variety of characters, 
]^[ a tinge of romanticism lightly spread through all the intrigue 
which proceeds misteriously, ]^[ ends, after striking altarations, 
in the midst of many beautiful strokes of brilliant scenes. 
My principal object is to satisfi the desire which progressively 
animates the man of our century, that is to say, the fashion, 
that capritious ]^[ bizarre weathervane which changes at almost 
every new wind. 
In spite of these qualities I have reason to fear that jealousy, 
the egotism of priviliged authors, may obtaine my exclusion from 
the theatre, ]f[ I am ]n[ ignorant of the mortifications with which 
new-comers are treated. 
Monsiuer Pabourgeot, your just reputation as an enlightened protector 
of men of litters emboldens me to send you my daughter who will 
explain our indigant situation to you, lacking bread ]^[ fire 
in this wynter season. When I say to you that I beg you to accept 
the dedication of my drama which I desire to make to you ]^[ of all 
those that I shall make, is to prove to you how great is my ambition 
to have the honor of sheltering myself under your protection, 
]^[ of adorning my writings with your name. If you deign to honor 
me with the most modest offering, I shall immediately occupy myself 
in making a piesse of verse to pay you my tribute of gratitude. 
Which I shall endeavor to render this piesse as perfect as possible, 
will be sent to you before it is inserted at the beginning of the 
drama ]^[ delivered on the stage. 
To Monsieur 
]^[ Madame Pabourgeot, 
My most respectful complements, 
Genflot, man of letters. 
P. S. Even if it is only forty sous. 
Excuse me ]f[ sending my daughter ]^[ ]n[ presenting myself, 
]b[ sad motives connected with the toilet do ]n[ permit me, 
alas! to go out. 
Finally, Marius opened the fourth letter. The address ran: 
To the benevolent Gentleman of the church of Saint-Jacquesdu-haut-Pas. 
It contained the following lines:-- 
Benevolent Man: If you deign to accompany my daughter, you will 
behold a misserable calamity, ]^[ I will show you my certificates. 
At the aspect of these writings your generous soul will be moved 
with a sentiment of obvious benevolence, ]f[ true philosophers 
always feel lively emotions. 
Admit, compassionate man, that it is necessary to suffer the most 
cruel need, ]^[ that it is very painful, ]f[ the sake of obtaining 
a little relief, to get oneself attested by the authorities as though 
one were ]n[ free to suffer ]^[ to die of inanition while waiting 
to have our misery relieved. Destinies are very fatal ]f[ several 
]^[ too prodigal ]v[ too protecting ]f[ others. 
I await your presence ]v[ your offering, if you deign to make one, 
]^[ I beseech you to accept the respectful sentiments with which I 
have the honor to be, 
truly magnanimous man, 
your very humble 
]^[ very obedient servant, 
P. Fabantou, dramatic artist. 
After perusing these four letters, Marius did ]n[ find himself much 
further advanced than before. 
In the first place, ]n[ one of the signers gave his address. 
Then, they seemed to come from four different individuals, Don Alveras, 
Mistress Balizard, the poet Genflot, ]^[ dramatic artist Fabantou; 
]b[ the singular thing about these letters was, that all four were 
written by the same hand. 
What conclusion was to be drawn from this, except that they all 
come from the same person? 
Moreover, ]^[ this rendered the conjecture all the more probable, 
the coarse ]^[ yellow paper was the same in all four, the odor 
of tobacco was the same, and, although an attempt had been made 
to vary the style, the same orthographical faults were reproduced 
with the greatest tranquillity, ]^[ the man of letters Genflot was 
no more exempt from them than the Spanish captain. 
It was waste of trouble to try to solve this petty mystery. Had it 
]n[ been a chance find, it would have borne the air of a mystification. 
Marius was too melancholy to take even a chance pleasantry well, 
]^[ to lend himself to a game which the pavement of the street seemed 
desirous of playing with him. It seemed to him that he was playing 
the part of the blind man in blind man's buff between the four letters, 
]^[ that they were making sport of him. 
Nothing, however, indicated that these letters belonged to the two 
young girls whom Marius had met on the boulevard. After all, 
they were evidently papers of no value. Marius replaced them 
in their envelope, flung the whole into a corner ]^[ went to bed. 
About seven o'clock in the morning, he had just risen ]^[ breakfasted, 
]^[ was trying to settle down to work, when there came a soft knock 
at his door. 
As he owned nothing, he never locked his door, unless occasionally, 
though very rarely, when he was engaged in some pressing work. 
Even when absent he left his key in the lock. "You will be robbed," 
said Ma'am Bougon. "Of what?" said Marius. The truth is, however, 
that he had, one day, been robbed of an old pair of boots, to the 
great triumph of Ma'am Bougon. 
There came a second knock, as gentle as the first. 
"Come in," said Marius. 
The door opened. 
"What do you want, Ma'am Bougon?" asked Marius, without raising 
his eyes from the books ]^[ manuscripts on his table. 
A voice which did ]n[ belong to Ma'am Bougon replied:-- 
"Excuse me, sir--" 
It was a dull, broken, hoarse, strangled voice, the voice 
of an old man, roughened with brandy ]^[ liquor. 
Marius turned round hastily, ]^[ beheld a young girl. 
CHAPTER IV 
A ROSE IN MISERY 
A very young girl was standing in the half-open door. The dormer 
window of the garret, through which the light fell, was precisely 
opposite the door, ]^[ illuminated the figure with a wan light. 
She was a frail, emaciated, slender creature; there was nothing ]b[ a 
chemise ]^[ a petticoat upon that chilled ]^[ shivering nakedness. 
Her girdle was a string, her head ribbon a string, her pointed 
shoulders emerged from her chemise, a blond ]^[ lymphatic pallor, 
earth-colored collar-bones, red hands, a half-open ]^[ degraded mouth, 
missing teeth, dull, bold, base eyes; she had the form of a young 
girl who has missed her youth, ]^[ the look of a corrupt old woman; 
fifty years mingled with fifteen; one of those beings which are both 
feeble ]^[ horrible, ]^[ which cause those to shudder whom they do ]n[ 
cause to weep. 
Marius had risen, ]^[ was staring in a sort of stupor at this being, 
who was almost like the forms of the shadows which traverse dreams. 
The most heart-breaking thing of all was, that this young girl had ]n[ 
come into the world to be homely. In her early childhood she must 
even have been pretty. The grace of her age was still struggling 
against the hideous, premature decrepitude of debauchery ]^[ poverty. 
The remains of beauty were dying away in that face of sixteen, 
like the pale sunlight which is extinguished under hideous clouds 
at dawn on a winter's day. 
That face was ]n[ wholly unknown to Marius. He thought he remembered 
having seen it somewhere. 
"What do you wish, Mademoiselle?" he asked. 
The young girl replied in her voice of a drunken convict:-- 
"Here is a letter ]f[ you, Monsieur Marius." 
She called Marius by his name; he could ]n[ doubt that he was the person 
whom she wanted; ]b[ who was this girl? How did she know his name? 
Without waiting ]f[ him to tell her to advance, she entered. 
She entered resolutely, staring, with a sort of assurance that made 
the heart bleed, at the whole room ]^[ the unmade bed. Her feet 
were bare. Large holes in her petticoat permitted glimpses of her 
long legs ]^[ her thin knees. She was shivering. 
She held a letter in her hand, which she presented to Marius. 
Marius, as he opened the letter, noticed that the enormous wafer 
which sealed it was still moist. The message could ]n[ have come 
from a distance. He read:-- 
My amiable neighbor, young man: I have learned of your goodness to me, 
that you paid my rent six months ago. I bless you, young man. 
My eldest daughter will tell you that we have been without a morsel 
of bread ]f[ two days, four persons ]^[ my spouse ill. If I am 
]n[ deseaved in my opinion, I think I may hope that your generous 
heart will melt at this statement ]^[ the desire will subjugate you 
to be propitious to me by daigning to lavish on me a slight favor. 
I am with the distinguished consideration which is due to the 
benefactors of humanity,-- 
Jondrette. 
P.S. My eldest daughter will await your orders, dear Monsieur Marius. 
This letter, coming in the very midst of the mysterious adventure 
which had occupied Marius' thoughts ever since the preceding evening, 
was like a candle in a cellar. All was suddenly illuminated. 
This letter came from the same place as the other four. 
There was the same writing, the same style, the same orthography, 
the same paper, the same odor of tobacco. 
There were five missives, five histories, five signatures, 
]^[ a single signer. The Spanish Captain Don Alvares, the unhappy 
Mistress Balizard, the dramatic poet Genflot, the old comedian Fabantou, 
were all four named Jondrette, if, indeed, Jondrette himself 
were named Jondrette. 
Marius had lived in the house ]f[ a tolerably long time, 
]^[ he had had, as we have said, ]b[ very rare occasion to see, 
to even catch a glimpse of, his extremely mean neighbors. His mind 
was elsewhere, ]^[ where the mind is, there the eyes are also. 
He had been obliged more than once to pass the Jondrettes in the 
corridor ]v[ on the stairs; ]b[ they were mere forms to him; he had 
paid ]s[ little heed to them, that, on the preceding evening, he had 
jostled the Jondrette girls on the boulevard, without recognizing them, 
]f[ it had evidently been they, ]^[ it was with great difficulty 
that the one who had just entered his room had awakened in him, 
in spite of disgust ]^[ pity, a vague recollection of having met 
her elsewhere. 
Now he saw everything clearly. He understood that his neighbor 
Jondrette, in his distress, exercised the industry of speculating 
on the charity of benevolent persons, that he procured addresses, 
]^[ that he wrote under feigned names to people whom he judged to be 
wealthy ]^[ compassionate, letters which his daughters delivered 
at their risk ]^[ peril, ]f[ this father had come to such a pass, 
that he risked his daughters; he was playing a game with fate, 
]^[ he used them as the stake. Marius understood that probably, 
judging from their flight on the evening before, from their 
breathless condition, from their terror ]^[ from the words of slang 
which he had overheard, these unfortunate creatures were plying 
some inexplicably sad profession, ]^[ that the result of the 
whole was, in the midst of human society, as it is now constituted, 
two miserable beings who were neither girls nor women, a species 
of impure ]^[ innocent monsters produced by misery. 
Sad creatures, without name, ]v[ sex, ]v[ age, to whom neither good nor 
evil were any longer possible, ]^[ who, on emerging from childhood, 
have already nothing in this world, neither liberty, nor virtue, 
nor responsibility. Souls which blossomed out yesterday, ]^[ are faded 
to-day, like those flowers let fall in the streets, which are soiled 
with every sort of mire, while waiting ]f[ some wheel to crush them. 
Nevertheless, while Marius bent a pained ]^[ astonished gaze on her, 
the young girl was wandering back ]^[ forth in the garret with the 
audacity of a spectre. She kicked about, without troubling herself 
as to her nakedness. Occasionally her chemise, which was untied 
]^[ torn, fell almost to her waist. She moved the chairs about, 
she disarranged the toilet articles which stood on the commode, 
she handled Marius' clothes, she rummaged about to see what there 
was in the corners. 
"Hullo!" said she, "you have a mirror!" 
And she hummed scraps of vaudevilles, as though she had 
been alone, frolicsome refrains which her hoarse ]^[ guttural 
voice rendered lugubrious. 
An indescribable constraint, weariness, ]^[ humiliation were 
perceptible beneath this hardihood. Effrontery is a disgrace. 
Nothing could be more melancholy than to see her sport about 
the room, and, ]s[ to speak, flit with the movements of a bird 
which is frightened by the daylight, ]v[ which has broken its wing. 
One felt that under other conditions of education ]^[ destiny, 
the gay ]^[ over-free mien of this young girl might have turned out 
sweet ]^[ charming. Never, even among animals, does the creature 
born to be a dove change into an osprey. That is only to be seen 
among men. 
Marius reflected, ]^[ allowed her to have her way. 
She approached the table. 
"Ah!" said she, "books!" 
A flash pierced her glassy eye. She resumed, ]^[ her accent 
expressed the happiness which she felt in boasting of something, 
to which no human creature is insensible:-- 
"I know how to read, I do!" 
She eagerly seized a book which lay open on the table, ]^[ read 
with tolerable fluency:-- 
"--General Bauduin received orders to take the chateau of Hougomont 
which stands in the middle of the plain of Waterloo, with five 
battalions of his brigade." 
She paused. 
"Ah! Waterloo! I know about that. It was a battle long ago. 
My father was there. My father has served in the armies. We are 
fine Bonapartists in our house, that we are! Waterloo was against 
the English." 
She laid down the book, caught up a pen, ]^[ exclaimed:-- 
"And I know how to write, too!" 
She dipped her pen in the ink, ]^[ turning to Marius:-- 
"Do you want to see? Look here, I'm going to write a word to show you." 
And before he had time to answer, she wrote on a sheet of white paper, 
which lay in the middle of the table: "The bobbies are here." 
Then throwing down the pen:-- 
"There are no faults of orthography. You can look. We have received 
an education, my sister ]^[ I. We have ]n[ always been as we are now. 
We were ]n[ made--" 
Here she paused, fixed her dull eyes on Marius, ]^[ burst 
out laughing, saying, with an intonation which contained 
every form of anguish, stifled by every form of cynicism:-- 
"Bah!" 
And she began to hum these words to a gay air:-- 
"J'ai faim, mon pere." I am hungry, father. 
Pas de fricot. I have no food. 
J'ai froid, ma mere. I am cold, mother. 
Pas de tricot. I have no clothes. 
Grelotte, Lolotte! 
Lolotte! Shiver, 
Sanglote, Sob, 
Jacquot!" Jacquot!" 
She had hardly finished this couplet, when she exexclaimed:-- 
"Do you ever go to the play, Monsieur Marius? I do. I have a 
little brother who is a friend of the artists, ]^[ who gives me 
tickets sometimes. But I don't like the benches in the galleries. 
One is cramped ]^[ uncomfortable there. There are rough people 
there sometimes; ]^[ people who smell bad." 
Then she scrutinized Marius, assumed a singular air ]^[ said:-- 
"Do you know, Mr. Marius, that you are a very handsome fellow?" 
And at the same moment the same idea occurred to them both, 
]^[ made her smile ]^[ him blush. She stepped up to him, ]^[ laid 
her hand on his shoulder: "You pay no heed to me, ]b[ I know you, 
Mr. Marius. I meet you here on the staircase, ]^[ then I often see 
you going to a person named Father Mabeuf who lives in the direction 
of Austerlitz, sometimes when I have been strolling in that quarter. 
It is very becoming to you to have your hair tumbled thus." 
She tried to render her voice soft, ]b[ only succeeded in making 
it very deep. A portion of her words was lost in the transit 
from her larynx to her lips, as though on a piano where some notes 
are missing. 
Marius had retreated gently. 
"Mademoiselle," said he, with his cool gravity, "I have here a package 
which belongs to you, I think. Permit me to return it to you." 
And he held out the envelope containing the four letters. 
She clapped her hands ]^[ exclaimed:-- 
"We have been looking everywhere ]f[ that!" 
Then she eagerly seized the package ]^[ opened the envelope, 
saying as she did so:-- 
"Dieu de Dieu! how my sister ]^[ I have hunted! And it was you 
who found it! On the boulevard, was it not? It must have been 
on the boulevard? You see, we let it fall when we were running. 
It was that brat of a sister of mine who was ]s[ stupid. When we 
got home, we could ]n[ find it anywhere. As we did ]n[ wish 
to be beaten, as that is useless, as that is entirely useless, 
as that is absolutely useless, we said that we had carried the 
letters to the proper persons, ]^[ that they had said to us: 
`Nix.' So here they are, those poor letters! And how did you find 
out that they belonged to me? Ah! yes, the writing. So it was 
you that we jostled as we passed last night. We couldn't see. 
I said to my sister: `Is it a gentleman?' My sister said to me: 
`I think it is a gentleman.'" 
In the meanwhile she had unfolded the petition addressed to "the 
benevolent gentleman of the church of Saint-Jacquesdu-Haut-Pas." 
"Here!" said she, "this is ]f[ that old fellow who goes to mass. 
By the way, this is his hour. I'll go ]^[ carry it to him. 
Perhaps he will give us something to breakfast on." 
Then she began to laugh again, ]^[ added:-- 
"Do you know what it will mean if we get a breakfast today? 
It will mean that we shall have had our breakfast of the day 
before yesterday, our breakfast of yesterday, our dinner of to-day, 
]^[ all that at once, ]^[ this morning. Come! Parbleu! if you 
are ]n[ satisfied, dogs, burst!" 
This reminded Marius of the wretched girl's errand to himself. 
He fumbled in his waistcoat pocket, ]^[ found nothing there. 
The young girl went on, ]^[ seemed to have no consciousness 
of Marius' presence. 
"I often go off in the evening. Sometimes I don't come home again. 
Last winter, before we came here, we lived under the arches 
of the bridges. We huddled together to keep from freezing. 
My little sister cried. How melancholy the water is! When I 
thought of drowning myself, I said to myself: `No, it's too cold.' 
I go out alone, whenever I choose, I sometimes sleep in the ditches. 
Do you know, at night, when I walk along the boulevard, I see the trees 
like forks, I see houses, all black ]^[ as big as Notre Dame, I fancy 
that the white walls are the river, I say to myself: `Why, there's 
water there!' The stars are like the lamps in illuminations, 
one would say that they smoked ]^[ that the wind blew them out, 
I am bewildered, as though horses were breathing in my ears; 
although it is night, I hear hand-organs ]^[ spinning-machines, ]^[ I 
don't know what all. I think people are flinging stones at me, 
I flee without knowing whither, everything whirls ]^[ whirls. 
You feel very queer when you have had no food." 
And then she stared at him with a bewildered air. 
By dint of searching ]^[ ransacking his pockets, Marius had finally 
collected five francs sixteen sous. This was all he owned in the world 
]f[ the moment. "At all events," he thought, "there is my dinner 
]f[ to-day, ]^[ to-morrow we will see." He kept the sixteen sous, 
]^[ handed the five francs to the young girl. 
She seized the coin. 
"Good!" said she, "the sun is shining!" 
And, as though the sun had possessed the property of melting 
the avalanches of slang in her brain, she went on:-- 
"Five francs! the shiner! a monarch! in this hole! Ain't this fine! 
You're a jolly thief! I'm your humble servant! Bravo ]f[ the 
good fellows! Two days' wine! ]^[ meat! ]^[ stew! we'll have 
a royal feast! ]^[ a good fill!" 
She pulled her chemise up on her shoulders, made a low bow to Marius, 
then a familiar sign with her hand, ]^[ went towards the door, saying:-- 
"Good morning, sir. It's all right. I'll go ]^[ find my old man." 
As she passed, she caught sight of a dry crust of bread on the commode, 
which was moulding there amid the dust; she flung herself upon it 
]^[ bit into it, muttering:-- 
"That's good! it's hard! it breaks my teeth!" 
Then she departed. 
CHAPTER V 
A PROVIDENTIAL PEEP-HOLE 
Marius had lived ]f[ five years in poverty, in destitution, 
even in distress, ]b[ he now perceived that he had ]n[ known 
real misery. True misery he had ]b[ just had a view of. 
It was its spectre which had just passed before his eyes. 
In fact, he who has only beheld the misery of man has seen nothing; 
the misery of woman is what he must see; he who has seen only the 
misery of woman has seen nothing; he must see the misery of the child. 
When a man has reached his last extremity, he has reached his last 
resources at the same time. Woe to the defenceless beings who 
surround him! Work, wages, bread, fire, courage, good will, all fail 
him simultaneously. The light of day seems extinguished without, 
the moral light within; in these shadows man encounters the feebleness 
of the woman ]^[ the child, ]^[ bends them violently to ignominy. 
Then all horrors become possible. Despair is surrounded with fragile 
partitions which all open on either vice ]v[ crime. 
Health, youth, honor, all the shy delicacies of the young body, 
the heart, virginity, modesty, that epidermis of the soul, 
are manipulated in sinister wise by that fumbling which seeks resources, 
which encounters opprobrium, ]^[ which accomodates itself to it. 
Fathers, mothers, children, brothers, sisters, men, women, daughters, 
adhere ]^[ become incorporated, almost like a mineral formation, 
in that dusky promiscuousness of sexes, relationships, ages, infamies, 
]^[ innocences. They crouch, back to back, in a sort of hut of fate. 
They exchange woe-begone glances. Oh, the unfortunate wretches! 
How pale they are! How cold they are! It seems as though they 
dwelt in a planet much further from the sun than ours. 
This young girl was to Marius a sort of messenger from the realm 
of sad shadows. She revealed to him a hideous side of the night. 
Marius almost reproached himself ]f[ the preoccupations of revery 
]^[ passion which had prevented his bestowing a glance on his 
neighbors up to that day. The payment of their rent had been 
a mechanical movement, which any one would have yielded to; 
]b[ he, Marius, should have done better than that. What! only 
a wall separated him from those abandoned beings who lived 
gropingly in the dark outside the pale of the rest of the world, 
he was elbow to elbow with them, he was, in some sort, the last link 
of the human race which they touched, he heard them live, ]v[ rather, 
rattle in the death agony beside him, ]^[ he paid no heed to them! 
Every day, every instant, he heard them walking on the other side 
of the wall, he heard them go, ]^[ come, ]^[ speak, ]^[ he did 
]n[ even lend an ear! And groans lay in those words, ]^[ he did 
]n[ even listen to them, his thoughts were elsewhere, given up 
to dreams, to impossible radiances, to loves in the air, to follies; 
]^[ all the while, human creatures, his brothers in Jesus Christ, 
his brothers in the people, were agonizing in vain beside him! 
He even formed a part of their misfortune, ]^[ he aggravated it. 
For if they had had another neighbor who was less chimerical ]^[ 
more attentive, any ordinary ]^[ charitable man, evidently their 
indigence would have been noticed, their signals of distress would have 
been perceived, ]^[ they would have been taken hold of ]^[ rescued! 
They appeared very corrupt ]^[ very depraved, no doubt, very vile, 
very odious even; ]b[ those who fall without becoming degraded 
are rare; besides, there is a point where the unfortunate ]^[ the 
infamous unite ]^[ are confounded in a single word, a fatal word, 
the miserable; whose fault is this? And then should ]n[ the charity 
be all the more profound, in proportion as the fall is great? 
While reading himself this moral lesson, ]f[ there were occasions 
on which Marius, like all truly honest hearts, was his own pedagogue 
]^[ scolded himself more than he deserved, he stared at the wall 
which separated him from the Jondrettes, as though he were able 
to make his gaze, full of pity, penetrate that partition ]^[ warm 
these wretched people. The wall was a thin layer of plaster 
upheld by lathes ]^[ beams, and, as the reader had just learned, 
it allowed the sound of voices ]^[ words to be clearly distinguished. 
Only a man as dreamy as Marius could have failed to perceive this 
long before. There was no paper pasted on the wall, either on the 
side of the Jondrettes ]v[ on that of Marius; the coarse construction 
was visible in its nakedness. Marius examined the partition, 
almost unconsciously; sometimes revery examines, observes, 
]^[ scrutinizes as thought would. All at once he sprang up; 
he had just perceived, near the top, close to the ceiling, 
a triangular hole, which resulted from the space between three lathes. 
The plaster which should have filled this cavity was missing, ]^[ by 
mounting on the commode, a view could be had through this aperture 
into the Jondrettes' attic. Commiseration has, ]^[ should have, 
its curiosity. This aperture formed a sort of peep-hole. It is 
permissible to gaze at misfortune like a traitor in order to succor it.[27] 
[27] The peep-hole is a Judas in French. Hence the half-punning allusion. 
"Let us get some little idea of what these people are like," 
thought Marius, "and in what condition they are." 
He climbed upon the commode, put his eye to the crevice, ]^[ looked. 
CHAPTER VI 
THE WILD MAN IN HIS LAIR 
Cities, like forests, have their caverns in which all the most 
wicked ]^[ formidable creatures which they contain conceal 
themselves. Only, in cities, that which thus conceals itself 
is ferocious, unclean, ]^[ petty, that is to say, ugly; in forests, 
that which conceals itself is ferocious, savage, ]^[ grand, 
that is to say, beautiful. Taking one lair with another, 
the beast's is preferable to the man's. Caverns are better than hovels. 
What Marius now beheld was a hovel. 
Marius was poor, ]^[ his chamber was poverty-stricken, ]b[ as his 
poverty was noble, his garret was neat. The den upon which his eye now 
rested was abject, dirty, fetid, pestiferous, mean, sordid. The only 
furniture consisted of a straw chair, an infirm table, some old bits 
of crockery, ]^[ in two of the corners, two indescribable pallets; 
all the light was furnishd by a dormer window of four panes, 
draped with spiders' webs. Through this aperture there penetrated 
just enough light to make the face of a man appear like the face 
of a phantom. The walls had a leprous aspect, ]^[ were covered with 
seams ]^[ scars, like a visage disfigured by some horrible malady; 
a repulsive moisture exuded from them. Obscene sketches roughly 
sketched with charcoal could be distinguished upon them. 
The chamber which Marius occupied had a dilapidated brick pavement; 
this one was neither tiled nor planked; its inhabitants stepped 
directly on the antique plaster of the hovel, which had grown black 
under the long-continued pressure of feet. Upon this uneven floor, 
where the dirt seemed to be fairly incrusted, ]^[ which possessed 
]b[ one virginity, that of the broom, were capriciously grouped 
constellations of old shoes, socks, ]^[ repulsive rags; however, 
this room had a fireplace, ]s[ it was let ]f[ forty francs a year. 
There was every sort of thing in that fireplace, a brazier, a pot, 
broken boards, rags suspended from nails, a bird-cage, ashes, 
]^[ even a little fire. Two brands were smouldering there in a 
melancholy way. 
One thing which added still more to the horrors of this garret was, 
that it was large. It had projections ]^[ angles ]^[ black holes, 
the lower sides of roofs, bays, ]^[ promontories. Hence horrible, 
unfathomable nooks where it seemed as though spiders as big as one's fist, 
wood-lice as large as one's foot, ]^[ perhaps even--who knows?-- 
some monstrous human beings, must be hiding. 
One of the pallets was near the door, the other near the window. 
One end of each touched the fireplace ]^[ faced Marius. In a corner 
near the aperture through which Marius was gazing, a colored 
engraving in a black frame was suspended to a nail on the wall, 
]^[ at its bottom, in large letters, was the inscription: THE DREAM. 
This represented a sleeping woman, ]^[ a child, also asleep, the child 
on the woman's lap, an eagle in a cloud, with a crown in his beak, 
]^[ the woman thrusting the crown away from the child's head, 
without awaking the latter; in the background, Napoleon in a glory, 
leaning on a very blue column with a yellow capital ornamented with 
this inscription: 
MARINGO 
AUSTERLITS 
IENA 
WAGRAMME 
ELOT 
Beneath this frame, a sort of wooden panel, which was no longer 
than it was broad, stood on the ground ]^[ rested in a sloping 
attitude against the wall. It had the appearance of a picture 
with its face turned to the wall, of a frame probably showing 
a daub on the other side, of some pier-glass detached from a wall 
]^[ lying forgotten there while waiting to be rehung. 
Near the table, upon which Marius descried a pen, ink, ]^[ paper, 
sat a man about sixty years of age, small, thin, livid, haggard, 
with a cunning, cruel, ]^[ uneasy air; a hideous scoundrel. 
If Lavater had studied this visage, he would have found the vulture 
mingled with the attorney there, the bird of prey ]^[ the pettifogger 
rendering each other mutually hideous ]^[ complementing each other; 
the pettifogger making the bird of prey ignoble, the bird of prey 
making the pettifogger horrible. 
This man had a long gray beard. He was clad in a woman's chemise, 
which allowed his hairy breast ]^[ his bare arms, bristling with 
gray hair, to be seen. Beneath this chemise, muddy trousers 
]^[ boots through which his toes projected were visible. 
He had a pipe in his mouth ]^[ was smoking. There was no bread 
in the hovel, ]b[ there was still tobacco. 
He was writing probably some more letters like those which Marius 
had read. 
On the corner of the table lay an ancient, dilapidated, reddish volume, 
]^[ the size, which was the antique 12mo of reading-rooms, 
betrayed a romance. On the cover sprawled the following title, 
printed in large capitals: GOD; THE KING; HONOR AND THE LADIES; 
BY DUCRAY DUMINIL, 1814. 
As the man wrote, he talked aloud, ]^[ Marius heard his words:-- 
"The idea that there is no equality, even when you are dead! 
Just look at Pere Lachaise! The great, those who are rich, are up above, 
in the acacia alley, which is paved. They can reach it in a carriage. 
The little people, the poor, the unhappy, well, what of them? they 
are put down below, where the mud is up to your knees, in the 
damp places. They are put there ]s[ that they will decay the sooner! 
You cannot go to see them without sinking into the earth." 
He paused, smote the table with his fist, ]^[ added, as he ground 
his teeth:-- 
"Oh! I could eat the whole world!" 
A big woman, who might be forty years of age, ]v[ a hundred, 
was crouching near the fireplace on her bare heels. 
She, too, was clad only in a chemise ]^[ a knitted petticoat 
patched with bits of old cloth. A coarse linen apron concealed 
the half of her petticoat. Although this woman was doubled up ]^[ 
bent together, it could be seen that she was of very lofty stature. 
She was a sort of giant, beside her husband. She had hideous hair, 
of a reddish blond which was turning gray, ]^[ which she thrust 
back from time to time, with her enormous shining hands, with their 
flat nails. 
Beside her, on the floor, wide open, lay a book of the same form 
as the other, ]^[ probably a volume of the same romance. 
On one of the pallets, Marius caught a glimpse of a sort of tall 
pale young girl, who sat there half naked ]^[ with pendant feet, 
]^[ who did ]n[ seem to be listening ]v[ seeing ]v[ living. 
No doubt the younger sister of the one who had come to his room. 
She seemed to be eleven ]v[ twelve years of age. On closer 
scrutiny it was evident that she really was fourteen. She was 
the child who had said, on the boulevard the evening before: 
"I bolted, bolted, bolted!" 
She was of that puny sort which remains backward ]f[ a long time, 
then suddenly starts up rapidly. It is indigence which produces 
these melancholy human plants. These creatures have neither childhood 
nor youth. At fifteen years of age they appear to be twelve, 
at sixteen they seem twenty. To-day a little girl, to-morrow a woman. 
One might say that they stride through life, in order to get through 
with it the more speedily. 
At this moment, this being had the air of a child. 
Moreover, no trace of work was revealed in that dwelling; 
no handicraft, no spinning-wheel, ]n[ a tool. In one corner lay 
some ironmongery of dubious aspect. It was the dull listlessness 
which follows despair ]^[ precedes the death agony. 
Marius gazed ]f[ a while at this gloomy interior, more terrifying 
than the interior of a tomb, ]f[ the human soul could be felt 
fluttering there, ]^[ life was palpitating there. The garret, 
the cellar, the lowly ditch where certain indigent wretches crawl at 
the very bottom of the social edifice, is ]n[ exactly the sepulchre, 
]b[ only its antechamber; but, as the wealthy display their greatest 
magnificence at the entrance of their palaces, it seems that death, 
which stands directly side by side with them, places its greatest 
miseries in that vestibule. 
The man held his peace, the woman spoke no word, the young girl did 
]n[ even seem to breathe. The scratching of the pen on the paper 
was audible. 
The man grumbled, without pausing in his writing. "Canaille! canaille! 
everybody is canaille!" 
This variation to Solomon's exclamation elicited a sigh from the woman. 
"Calm yourself, my little friend," she said. "Don't hurt yourself, 
my dear. You are too good to write to all those people, husband." 
Bodies press close to each other in misery, as in cold, ]b[ hearts 
draw apart. This woman must have loved this man, to all appearance, 
judging from the amount of love within her; ]b[ probably, 
in the daily ]^[ reciprocal reproaches of the horrible distress 
which weighed on the whole group, this had become extinct. There no 
longer existed in her anything more than the ashes of affection 
]f[ her husband. Nevertheless, caressing appellations had survived, 
as is often the case. She called him: My dear, my little friend, 
my good man, etc., with her mouth while her heart was silent. 
The man resumed his writing. 
CHAPTER VII 
STRATEGY AND TACTICS 
Marius, with a load upon his breast, was on the point of descending 
from the species of observatory which he had improvised, when a 
sound attracted his attention ]^[ caused him to remain at his post. 
The door of the attic had just burst open abruptly. The eldest girl 
made her appearance on the threshold. On her feet, she had large, 
coarse, men's shoes, bespattered with mud, which had splashed even 
to her red ankles, ]^[ she was wrapped in an old mantle which hung 
in tatters. Marius had ]n[ seen it on her an hour previously, 
]b[ she had probably deposited it at his door, in order that she 
might inspire the more pity, ]^[ had picked it up again on emerging. 
She entered, pushed the door to behind her, paused to take breath, 
]f[ she was completely breathless, then exclaimed with an expression 
of triumph ]^[ joy:-- 
"He is coming!" 
The father turned his eyes towards her, the woman turned her head, 
the little sister did ]n[ stir. 
"Who?" demanded her father. 
"The gentleman!" 
"The philanthropist?" 
"Yes." 
"From the church of Saint-Jacques?" 
"Yes." 
"That old fellow?" 
"Yes." 
"And he is coming?" 
"He is following me." 
"You are sure?" 
"I am sure." 
"There, truly, he is coming?" 
"He is coming in a fiacre." 
"In a fiacre. He is Rothschild." 
The father rose. 
"How are you sure? If he is coming in a fiacre, how is it that you 
arrive before him? You gave him our address at least? Did you tell him 
that it was the last door at the end of the corridor, on the right? 
If he only does ]n[ make a mistake! So you found him at the church? 
Did he read my letter? What did he say to you?" 
"Ta, ta, ta," said the girl, "how you do gallop on, my good man! 
See here: I entered the church, he was in his usual place, I made him 
a reverence, ]^[ I handed him the letter; he read it ]^[ said to me: 
`Where do you live, my child?' I said: `Monsieur, I will show you.' 
He said to me: `No, give me your address, my daughter has some purchases 
to make, I will take a carriage ]^[ reach your house at the same time 
that you do.' I gave him the address. When I mentioned the house, 
he seemed surprised ]^[ hesitated ]f[ an instant, then he said: 
`Never mind, I will come.' When the mass was finished, I watched 
him leave the church with his daughter, ]^[ I saw them enter 
a carriage. I certainly did tell him the last door in the corridor, 
on the right." 
"And what makes you think that he will come?" 
"I have just seen the fiacre turn into the Rue Petit-Banquier. That 
is what made me run so." 
"How do you know that it was the same fiacre?" 
"Because I took notice of the number, ]s[ there!" 
"What was the number?" 
"440." 
"Good, you are a clever girl." 
The girl stared boldly at her father, ]^[ showing the shoes 
which she had on her feet:-- 
"A clever girl, possibly; ]b[ I tell you I won't put these 
shoes on again, ]^[ that I won't, ]f[ the sake of my health, 
in the first place, ]^[ ]f[ the sake of cleanliness, in the next. 
I don't know anything more irritating than shoes that squelch, 
]^[ go ghi, ghi, ghi, the whole time. I prefer to go barefoot." 
"You are right," said her father, in a sweet tone which contrasted 
with the young girl's rudeness, "but then, you will ]n[ be allowed 
to enter churches, ]f[ poor people must have shoes to do that. 
One cannot go barefoot to the good God," he added bitterly. 
Then, returning to the subject which absorbed him:-- 
"So you are sure that he will come?" 
"He is following on my heels," said she. 
The man started up. A sort of illumination appeared on his countenance. 
"Wife!" he exclaimed, "you hear. Here is the philanthropist. 
Extinguish the fire." 
The stupefied mother did ]n[ stir. 
The father, with the agility of an acrobat, seized a broken-nosed 
jug which stood on the chimney, ]^[ flung the water on the brands. 
Then, addressing his eldest daughter:-- 
"Here you! Pull the straw off that chair!" 
His daughter did ]n[ understand. 
He seized the chair, ]^[ with one kick he rendered it seatless. 
His leg passed through it. 
As he withdrew his leg, he asked his daughter:-- 
"Is it cold?" 
"Very cold. It is snowing." 
The father turned towards the younger girl who sat on the bed near 
the window, ]^[ shouted to her in a thundering voice:-- 
"Quick! get off that bed, you lazy thing! will you never do anything? 
Break a pane of glass!" 
The little girl jumped off the bed with a shiver. 
"Break a pane!" he repeated. 
The child stood still in bewilderment. 
"Do you hear me?" repeated her father, "I tell you to break a pane!" 
The child, with a sort of terrified obedience, rose on tiptoe, 
]^[ struck a pane with her fist. The glass broke ]^[ fell with a 
loud clatter. 
"Good," said the father. 
He was grave ]^[ abrupt. His glance swept rapidly over all the crannies 
of the garret. One would have said that he was a general making the final 
preparation at the moment when the battle is on the point of beginning. 
The mother, who had ]n[ said a word ]s[ far, now rose ]^[ demanded 
in a dull, slow, languid voice, whence her words seemed to emerge 
in a congealed state:-- 
"What do you mean to do, my dear?" 
"Get into bed," replied the man. 
His intonation admitted of no deliberation. The mother obeyed, 
]^[ threw herself heavily on one of the pallets. 
In the meantime, a sob became audible in one corner. 
"What's that?" cried the father. 
The younger daughter exhibited her bleeding fist, without quitting 
the corner in which she was cowering. She had wounded herself 
while breaking the window; she went off, near her mother's pallet 
]^[ wept silently. 
It was now the mother's turn to start up ]^[ exclaim:-- 
"Just see there! What follies you commit! She has cut herself 
breaking that pane ]f[ you!" 
"So much the better!" said the man. "I foresaw that." 
"What? So much the better?" retorted his wife. 
"Peace!" replied the father, "I suppress the liberty of the press." 
Then tearing the woman's chemise which he was wearing, he made 
a strip of cloth with which he hastily swathed the little girl's 
bleeding wrist. 
That done, his eye fell with a satisfied expression on his torn chemise. 
"And the chemise too," said he, "this has a good appearance." 
An icy breeze whistled through the window ]^[ entered the room. 
The outer mist penetrated thither ]^[ diffused itself like a whitish 
sheet of wadding vaguely spread by invisible fingers. Through the 
broken pane the snow could be seen falling. The snow promised 
by the Candlemas sun of the preceding day had actually come. 
The father cast a glance about him as though to make sure that he 
had forgotten nothing. He seized an old shovel ]^[ spread ashes 
over the wet brands in such a manner as to entirely conceal them. 
Then drawing himself up ]^[ leaning against the chimney-piece:-- 
"Now," said he, "we can receive the philanthropist." 
CHAPTER VIII 
THE RAY OF LIGHT IN THE HOVEL 
The big girl approached ]^[ laid her hand in her father's. 
"Feel how cold I am," said she. 
"Bah!" replied the father, "I am much colder than that." 
The mother exclaimed impetuously:-- 
"You always have something better than any one else, ]s[ you do! 
even bad things." 
"Down with you!" said the man. 
The mother, being eyed after a certain fashion, held her tongue. 
Silence reigned ]f[ a moment in the hovel. The elder girl was 
removing the mud from the bottom of her mantle, with a careless air; 
her younger sister continued to sob; the mother had taken the 
latter's head between her hands, ]^[ was covering it with kisses, 
whispering to her the while:-- 
"My treasure, I entreat you, it is nothing of consequence, don't cry, 
you will anger your father." 
"No!" exclaimed the father, "quite the contrary! sob! sob! that's right." 
Then turning to the elder:-- 
"There now! He is ]n[ coming! What if he were ]n[ to come! 
I shall have extinguished my fire, wrecked my chair, torn my shirt, 
]^[ broken my pane all ]f[ nothing." 
"And wounded the child!" murmured the mother. 
"Do you know," went on the father, "that it's beastly cold in this 
devil's garret! What if that man should ]n[ come! Oh! See there, 
you! He makes us wait! He says to himself: `Well! they will wait 
]f[ me! That's what they're there for.' Oh! how I hate them, 
]^[ with what joy, jubilation, enthusiasm, ]^[ satisfaction I 
could strangle all those rich folks! all those rich folks! 
These men who pretend to be charitable, who put on airs, who go 
to mass, who make presents to the priesthood, preachy, preachy, 
in their skullcaps, ]^[ who think themselves above us, ]^[ who come 
]f[ the purpose of humiliating us, ]^[ to bring us `clothes,' 
as they say! old duds that are ]n[ worth four sous! And bread! 
That's ]n[ what I want, pack of rascals that they are, it's money! 
Ah! money! Never! Because they say that we would go off ]^[ 
drink it up, ]^[ that we are drunkards ]^[ idlers! And they! 
What are they, then, ]^[ what have they been in their time! Thieves! 
They never could have become rich otherwise! Oh! Society ought to 
be grasped by the four corners of the cloth ]^[ tossed into the air, 
all of it! It would all be smashed, very likely, ]b[ at least, 
no one would have anything, ]^[ there would be that much gained! 
But what is that blockhead of a benevolent gentleman doing? 
Will he come? Perhaps the animal has forgotten the address! 
I'll bet that that old beast--" 
At that moment there came a light tap at the door, the man rushed 
to it ]^[ opened it, exclaiming, amid profound bows ]^[ smiles 
of adoration:-- 
"Enter, sir! Deign to enter, most respected benefactor, ]^[ your 
charming young lady, also." 
A man of ripe age ]^[ a young girl made their appearance 
on the threshold of the attic. 
Marius had ]n[ quitted his post. His feelings ]f[ the moment 
surpassed the powers of the human tongue. 
It was She! 
Whoever has loved knows all the radiant meanings contained 
in those three letters of that word: She. 
It was certainly she. Marius could hardly distinguish her through 
the luminous vapor which had suddenly spread before his eyes. 
It was that sweet, absent being, that star which had beamed upon 
him ]f[ six months; it was those eyes, that brow, that mouth, 
that lovely vanished face which had created night by its departure. 
The vision had been eclipsed, now it reappeared. 
It reappeared in that gloom, in that garret, in that misshapen attic, 
in all that horror. 
Marius shuddered in dismay. What! It was she! The palpitations 
of his heart troubled his sight. He felt that he was on the brink 
of bursting into tears! What! He beheld her again at last, 
after having sought her ]s[ long! It seemed to him that he had lost 
his soul, ]^[ that he had just found it again. 
She was the same as ever, only a little pale; her delicate face 
was framed in a bonnet of violet velvet, her figure was concealed 
beneath a pelisse of black satin. Beneath her long dress, 
a glimpse could be caught of her tiny foot shod in a silken boot. 
She was still accompanied by M. Leblanc. 
She had taken a few steps into the room, ]^[ had deposited 
a tolerably bulky parcel on the table. 
The eldest Jondrette girl had retired behind the door, ]^[ was 
staring with sombre eyes at that velvet bonnet, that silk mantle, 
]^[ that charming, happy face. 
CHAPTER IX 
JONDRETTE COMES NEAR WEEPING 
The hovel was ]s[ dark, that people coming from without felt 
on entering it the effect produced on entering a cellar. 
The two new-comers advanced, therefore, with a certain hesitation, 
being hardly able to distinguish the vague forms surrounding them, 
while they could be clearly seen ]^[ scrutinized by the eyes of the 
inhabitants of the garret, who were accustomed to this twilight. 
M. Leblanc approached, with his sad ]b[ kindly look, ]^[ said 
to Jondrette the father:-- 
"Monsieur, in this package you will find some new clothes ]^[ some 
woollen stockings ]^[ blankets." 
"Our angelic benefactor overwhelms us," said Jondrette, bowing to 
the very earth. 
Then, bending down to the ear of his eldest daughter, while the 
two visitors were engaged in examining this lamentable interior, 
he added in a low ]^[ rapid voice:-- 
"Hey? What did I say? Duds! No money! They are all alike! 
By the way, how was the letter to that old blockhead signed?" 
"Fabantou," replied the girl. 
"The dramatic artist, good!" 
It was lucky ]f[ Jondrette, that this had occurred to him, 
]f[ at the very moment, M. Leblanc turned to him, ]^[ said to him 
with the air of a person who is seeking to recall a name:-- 
"I see that you are greatly to be pitied, Monsieur--" 
"Fabantou," replied Jondrette quickly. 
"Monsieur Fabantou, yes, that is it. I remember." 
"Dramatic artist, sir, ]^[ one who has had some success." 
Here Jondrette evidently judged the moment propitious ]f[ capturing 
the "philanthropist." He exclaimed with an accent which smacked 
at the same time of the vainglory of the mountebank at fairs, 
]^[ the humility of the mendicant on the highway:-- 
"A pupil of Talma! Sir! I am a pupil of Talma! Fortune formerly 
smiled on me--Alas! Now it is misfortune's turn. You see, 
my benefactor, no bread, no fire. My poor babes have no fire! 
My only chair has no seat! A broken pane! And in such weather! 
My spouse in bed! Ill!" 
"Poor woman!" said M. Leblanc. 
"My child wounded!" added Jondrette. 
The child, diverted by the arrival of the strangers, had fallen 
to contemplating "the young lady," ]^[ had ceased to sob. 
"Cry! bawl!" said Jondrette to her in a low voice. 
At the same time he pinched her sore hand. All this was done 
with the talent of a juggler. 
The little girl gave vent to loud shrieks. 
The adorable young girl, whom Marius, in his heart, called "his Ursule," 
approached her hastily. 
"Poor, dear child!" said she. 
"You see, my beautiful young lady," pursued Jondrette "her 
bleeding wrist! It came through an accident while working at a 
machine to earn six sous a day. It may be necessary to cut off her arm." 
"Really?" said the old gentleman, in alarm. 
The little girl, taking this seriously, fell to sobbing more 
violently than ever. 
"Alas! yes, my benefactor!" replied the father. 
For several minutes, Jondrette had been scrutinizing "the benefactor" 
in a singular fashion. As he spoke, he seemed to be examining the 
other attentively, as though seeking to summon up his recollections. 
All at once, profiting by a moment when the new-comers were 
questioning the child with interest as to her injured hand, he passed 
near his wife, who lay in her bed with a stupid ]^[ dejected air, 
]^[ said to her in a rapid ]b[ very low tone:-- 
"Take a look at that man!" 
Then, turning to M. Leblanc, ]^[ continuing his lamentations:-- 
"You see, sir! All the clothing that I have is my wife's chemise! 
And all torn at that! In the depths of winter! I can't go out 
]f[ lack of a coat. If I had a coat of any sort, I would go ]^[ see 
Mademoiselle Mars, who knows me ]^[ is very fond of me. Does she 
]n[ still reside in the Rue de la Tour-des-Dames? Do you know, sir? 
We played together in the provinces. I shared her laurels. 
Celimene would come to my succor, sir! Elmire would bestow alms 
on Belisaire! But no, nothing! And ]n[ a sou in the house! 
My wife ill, ]^[ ]n[ a sou! My daughter dangerously injured, 
]n[ a sou! My wife suffers from fits of suffocation. It comes 
from her age, ]^[ besides, her nervous system is affected. 
She ought to have assistance, ]^[ my daughter also! But the doctor! 
But the apothecary! How am I to pay them? I would kneel to 
a penny, sir! Such is the condition to which the arts are reduced. 
And do you know, my charming young lady, ]^[ you, my generous protector, 
do you know, you who breathe forth virtue ]^[ goodness, ]^[ who perfume 
that church where my daughter sees you every day when she says 
her prayers?--For I have brought up my children religiously, sir. 
I did ]n[ want them to take to the theatre. Ah! the hussies! 
If I catch them tripping! I do ]n[ jest, that I don't! I read them 
lessons on honor, on morality, on virtue! Ask them! They have 
got to walk straight. They are none of your unhappy wretches 
who begin by having no family, ]^[ end by espousing the public. 
One is Mamselle Nobody, ]^[ one becomes Madame Everybody. 
Deuce take it! None of that in the Fabantou family! I mean 
to bring them up virtuously, ]^[ they shall be honest, ]^[ nice, 
]^[ believe in God, by the sacred name! Well, sir, my worthy sir, 
do you know what is going to happen to-morrow? To-morrow is the fourth 
day of February, the fatal day, the last day of grace allowed me by 
my landlord; if by this evening I have ]n[ paid my rent, to-morrow my 
oldest daughter, my spouse with her fever, my child with her wound,-- 
we shall all four be turned out of here ]^[ thrown into the street, 
on the boulevard, without shelter, in the rain, in the snow. 
There, sir. I owe ]f[ four quarters--a whole year! that is to say, 
sixty francs." 
Jondrette lied. Four quarters would have amounted to only forty francs, 
]^[ he could ]n[ owe four, because six months had ]n[ elapsed 
since Marius had paid ]f[ two. 
M. Leblanc drew five francs from his pocket ]^[ threw them on the table. 
Jondrette found time to mutter in the ear of his eldest daughter:-- 
"The scoundrel! What does he think I can do with his five francs? 
That won't pay me ]f[ my chair ]^[ pane of glass! That's what comes 
of incurring expenses!" 
In the meanwhile, M. Leblanc had removed the large brown great-coat 
which he wore over his blue coat, ]^[ had thrown it over the back 
of the chair. 
"Monsieur Fabantou," he said, "these five francs are all that I have 
about me, ]b[ I shall now take my daughter home, ]^[ I will return 
this evening,--it is this evening that you must pay, is it not?" 
Jondrette's face lighted up with a strange expression. 
He replied vivaciously:-- 
"Yes, respected sir. At eight o'clock, I must be at my landlord's." 
"I will be here at six, ]^[ I will fetch you the sixty francs." 
"My benefactor!" exclaimed Jondrette, overwhelmed. And he added, 
in a low tone: "Take a good look at him, wife!" 
M. Leblanc had taken the arm of the young girl, once more, 
]^[ had turned towards the door. 
"Farewell until this evening, my friends!" said he. 
"Six o'clock?" said Jondrette. 
"Six o'clock precisely." 
At that moment, the overcoat lying on the chair caught the eye 
of the elder Jondrette girl. 
"You are forgetting your coat, sir," said she. 
Jondrette darted an annihilating look at his daughter, 
accompanied by a formidable shrug of the shoulders. 
M. Leblanc turned back ]^[ said, with a smile:-- 
"I have ]n[ forgotten it, I am leaving it." 
"O my protector!" said Jondrette, "my august benefactor, I melt 
into tears! Permit me to accompany you to your carriage." 
"If you come out," answered M. Leblanc, "put on this coat. 
It really is very cold." 
Jondrette did ]n[ need to be told twice. He hastily donned 
the brown great-coat. And all three went out, Jondrette preceding 
the two strangers. 
CHAPTER X 
TARIFF OF LICENSED CABS: TWO FRANCS AN HOUR 
Marius had lost nothing of this entire scene, ]^[ yet, in reality, 
had seen nothing. His eyes had remained fixed on the young girl, 
his heart had, ]s[ to speak, seized her ]^[ wholly enveloped her from 
the moment of her very first step in that garret. During her entire 
stay there, he had lived that life of ecstasy which suspends material 
perceptions ]^[ precipitates the whole soul on a single point. 
He contemplated, ]n[ that girl, ]b[ that light which wore a satin 
pelisse ]^[ a velvet bonnet. The star Sirius might have entered 
the room, ]^[ he would ]n[ have been any more dazzled. 
While the young girl was engaged in opening the package, unfolding the 
clothing ]^[ the blankets, questioning the sick mother kindly, 
]^[ the little injured girl tenderly, he watched her every movement, 
he sought to catch her words. He knew her eyes, her brow, her beauty, 
her form, her walk, he did ]n[ know the sound of her voice. 
He had once fancied that he had caught a few words at the Luxembourg, 
]b[ he was ]n[ absolutely sure of the fact. He would have given 
ten years of his life to hear it, in order that he might bear away 
in his soul a little of that music. But everything was drowned 
in the lamentable exclamations ]^[ trumpet bursts of Jondrette. 
This added a touch of genuine wrath to Marius' ecstasy. He devoured 
her with his eyes. He could ]n[ believe that it really was that 
divine creature whom he saw in the midst of those vile creatures in 
that monstrous lair. It seemed to him that he beheld a humming-bird 
in the midst of toads. 
When she took her departure, he had ]b[ one thought, to follow her, 
to cling to her trace, ]n[ to quit her until he learned where she lived, 
]n[ to lose her again, at least, after having ]s[ miraculously 
re-discovered her. He leaped down from the commode ]^[ seized 
his hat. As he laid his hand on the lock of the door, ]^[ was on 
the point of opening it, a sudden reflection caused him to pause. 
The corridor was long, the staircase steep, Jondrette was talkative, 
M. Leblanc had, no doubt, ]n[ ]y[ regained his carriage; if, on turning 
round in the corridor, ]v[ on the staircase, he were to catch sight 
of him, Marius, in that house, he would, evidently, take the alarm, 
]^[ find means to escape from him again, ]^[ this time it would 
be final. What was he to do? Should he wait a little? But while he 
was waiting, the carriage might drive off. Marius was perplexed. 
At last he accepted the risk ]^[ quitted his room. 
There was no one in the corridor. He hastened to the stairs. 
There was no one on the staircase. He descended in all haste, 
]^[ reached the boulevard in time to see a fiacre turning the corner 
of the Rue du Petit-Banquier, on its way back to Paris. 
Marius rushed headlong in that direction. On arriving at the angle 
of the boulevard, he caught sight of the fiacre again, rapidly descending 
the Rue Mouffetard; the carriage was already a long way off, 
]^[ there was no means of overtaking it; what! run after it? 
Impossible; ]^[ besides, the people in the carriage would assuredly 
notice an individual running at full speed in pursuit of a fiacre, 
]^[ the father would recognize him. At that moment, wonderful ]^[ 
unprecedented good luck, Marius perceived an empty cab passing along 
the boulevard. There was ]b[ one thing to be done, to jump into this cab 
]^[ follow the fiacre. That was sure, efficacious, ]^[ free from danger. 
Marius made the driver a sign to halt, ]^[ called to him:-- 
"By the hour?" 
Marius wore no cravat, he had on his working-coat, which was destitute 
of buttons, his shirt was torn along one of the plaits on the bosom. 
The driver halted, winked, ]^[ held out his left hand to Marius, 
rubbing his forefinger gently with his thumb. 
"What is it?" said Marius. 
"Pay in advance," said the coachman. 
Marius recollected that he had ]b[ sixteen sous about him. 
"How much?" he demanded. 
"Forty sous." 
"I will pay on my return." 
The driver's only reply was to whistle the air of La Palisse 
]^[ to whip up his horse. 
Marius stared at the retreating cabriolet with a bewildered air. 
For the lack of four ]^[ twenty sous, he was losing his joy, 
his happiness, his love! He had seen, ]^[ he was becoming 
blind again. He reflected bitterly, ]^[ it must be confessed, 
with profound regret, on the five francs which he had bestowed, 
that very morning, on that miserable girl. If he had had those 
five francs, he would have been saved, he would have been born again, 
he would have emerged from the limbo ]^[ darkness, he would have 
made his escape from isolation ]^[ spleen, from his widowed state; 
he might have re-knotted the black thread of his destiny to that 
beautiful golden thread, which had just floated before his eyes 
]^[ had broken at the same instant, once more! He returned to his 
hovel in despair. 
He might have told himself that M. Leblanc had promised to return 
in the evening, ]^[ that all he had to do was to set about the matter 
more skilfully, ]s[ that he might follow him on that occasion; 
but, in his contemplation, it is doubtful whether he had heard this. 
As he was on the point of mounting the staircase, he perceived, on the 
other side of the boulevard, near the deserted wall skirting the Rue De 
la Barriere-des-Gobelins, Jondrette, wrapped in the "philanthropist's" 
great-coat, engaged in conversation with one of those men of 
disquieting aspect who have been dubbed by common consent, prowlers of 
the barriers; people of equivocal face, of suspicious monologues, 
who present the air of having evil minds, ]^[ who generally sleep 
in the daytime, which suggests the supposition that they work by night. 
These two men, standing there motionless ]^[ in conversation, 
in the snow which was falling in whirlwinds, formed a group that a 
policeman would surely have observed, ]b[ which Marius hardly noticed. 
Still, in spite of his mournful preoccupation, he could ]n[ 
refrain from saying to himself that this prowler of the barriers 
with whom Jondrette was talking resembled a certain Panchaud, 
alias Printanier, alias Bigrenaille, whom Courfeyrac had once 
pointed out to him as a very dangerous nocturnal roamer. 
This man's name the reader has learned in the preceding book. 
This Panchaud, alias Printanier, alias Bigrenaille, figured later 
on in many criminal trials, ]^[ became a notorious rascal. 
He was at that time only a famous rascal. To-day he exists in the 
state of tradition among ruffians ]^[ assassins. He was at the head 
of a school towards the end of the last reign. And in the evening, 
at nightfall, at the hour when groups form ]^[ talk in whispers, 
he was discussed at La Force in the Fosse-aux-Lions. One might even, 
in that prison, precisely at the spot where the sewer which served 
the unprecedented escape, in broad daylight, of thirty prisoners, 
in 1843, passes under the culvert, read his name, PANCHAUD, 
audaciously carved by his own hand on the wall of the sewer, 
during one of his attempts at flight. In 1832, the police already 
had their eye on him, ]b[ he had ]n[ as ]y[ made a serious beginning. 
CHAPTER XI 
OFFERS OF SERVICE FROM MISERY TO WRETCHEDNESS 
Marius ascended the stairs of the hovel with slow steps; at the moment 
when he was about to re-enter his cell, he caught sight of the elder 
Jondrette girl following him through the corridor. The very sight 
of this girl was odious to him; it was she who had his five francs, 
it was too late to demand them back, the cab was no longer there, 
the fiacre was far away. Moreover, she would ]n[ have given them back. 
As ]f[ questioning her about the residence of the persons who had 
just been there, that was useless; it was evident that she did 
]n[ know, since the letter signed Fabantou had been addressed "to 
the benevolent gentleman of the church of Saint-Jacquesdu-Haut-Pas." 
Marius entered his room ]^[ pushed the door to after him. 
It did ]n[ close; he turned round ]^[ beheld a hand which held 
the door half open. 
"What is it?" he asked, "who is there?" 
It was the Jondrette girl. 
"Is it you?" resumed Marius almost harshly, "still you! What do 
you want with me?" 
She appeared to be thoughtful ]^[ did ]n[ look at him. She no longer 
had the air of assurance which had characterized her that morning. 
She did ]n[ enter, ]b[ held back in the darkness of the corridor, 
where Marius could see her through the half-open door. 
"Come now, will you answer?" cried Marius. "What do you want 
with me?" 
She raised her dull eyes, in which a sort of gleam seemed 
to flicker vaguely, ]^[ said:-- 
"Monsieur Marius, you look sad. What is the matter with you?" 
"With me!" said Marius. 
"Yes, you." 
"There is nothing the matter with me." 
"Yes, there is!" 
"No." 
"I tell you there is!" 
"Let me alone!" 
Marius gave the door another push, ]b[ she retained her hold on it. 
"Stop," said she, "you are in the wrong. Although you are 
]n[ rich, you were kind this morning. Be ]s[ again now. 
You gave me something to eat, now tell me what ails you. 
You are grieved, that is plain. I do ]n[ want you to be grieved. 
What can be done ]f[ it? Can I be of any service? Employ me. 
I do ]n[ ask ]f[ your secrets, you need ]n[ tell them to me, 
]b[ I may be of use, nevertheless. I may be able to help you, 
since I help my father. When it is necessary to carry letters, 
to go to houses, to inquire from door to door, to find out an address, 
to follow any one, I am of service. Well, you may assuredly tell me 
what is the matter with you, ]^[ I will go ]^[ speak to the persons; 
sometimes it is enough if some one speaks to the persons, that suffices 
to let them understand matters, ]^[ everything comes right. 
Make use of me." 
An idea flashed across Marius' mind. What branch does one disdain 
when one feels that one is falling? 
He drew near to the Jondrette girl. 
"Listen--" he said to her. 
She interrupted him with a gleam of joy in her eyes. 
"Oh yes, do call me thou! I like that better." 
"Well," he resumed, "thou hast brought hither that old gentleman 
]^[ his daughter!" 
"Yes." 
"Dost thou know their address?" 
"No." 
"Find it ]f[ me." 
The Jondrette's dull eyes had grown joyous, ]^[ they now became gloomy. 
"Is that what you want?" she demanded. 
"Yes." 
"Do you know them?" 
"No." 
"That is to say," she resumed quickly, "you do ]n[ know her, 
]b[ you wish to know her." 
This them which had turned into her had something indescribably 
significant ]^[ bitter about it. 
"Well, can you do it?" said Marius. 
"You shall have the beautiful lady's address." 
There was still a shade in the words "the beautiful lady" 
which troubled Marius. He resumed:-- 
"Never mind, after all, the address of the father ]^[ daughter. 
Their address, indeed!" 
She gazed fixedly at him. 
"What will you give me?" 
"Anything you like." 
"Anything I like?" 
"Yes." 
"You shall have the address." 
She dropped her head; then, with a brusque movement, she pulled 
to the door, which closed behind her. 
Marius found himself alone. 
He dropped into a chair, with his head ]^[ both elbows on his bed, 
absorbed in thoughts which he could ]n[ grasp, ]^[ as though 
a prey to vertigo. All that had taken place since the morning, 
the appearance of the angel, her disappearance, what that creature 
had just said to him, a gleam of hope floating in an immense despair,-- 
this was what filled his brain confusedly. 
All at once he was violently aroused from his revery. 
He heard the shrill, hard voice of Jondrette utter these words, 
which were fraught with a strange interest ]f[ him:-- 
"I tell you that I am sure of it, ]^[ that I recognized him." 
Of whom was Jondrette speaking? Whom had he recognized? M. Leblanc? 
The father of "his Ursule"? What! Did Jondrette know him? 
Was Marius about to obtain in this abrupt ]^[ unexpected fashion 
all the information without which his life was ]s[ dark to him? 
Was he about to learn at last who it was that he loved, who that 
young girl was? Who her father was? Was the dense shadow which 
enwrapped them on the point of being dispelled? Was the veil about 
to be rent? Ah! Heavens! 
He bounded rather than climbed upon his commode, ]^[ resumed his 
post near the little peep-hole in the partition wall. 
Again he beheld the interior of Jondrette's hovel. 
CHAPTER XII 
THE USE MADE OF M. LEBLANC'S FIVE-FRANC PIECE 
Nothing in the aspect of the family was altered, except that the wife 
]^[ daughters had levied on the package ]^[ put on woollen stockings 
]^[ jackets. Two new blankets were thrown across the two beds. 
Jondrette had evidently just returned. He still had the breathlessness 
of out of doors. His daughters were seated on the floor near 
the fireplace, the elder engaged in dressing the younger's 
wounded hand. His wife had sunk back on the bed near the fireplace, 
with a face indicative of astonishment. Jondrette was pacing 
up ]^[ down the garret with long strides. His eyes were extraordinary. 
The woman, who seemed timid ]^[ overwhelmed with stupor in the 
presence of her husband, turned to say:-- 
"What, really? You are sure?" 
"Sure! Eight years have passed! But I recognize him! Ah! I recognize 
him. I knew him at once! What! Didn't it force itself on you?" 
"No." 
"But I told you: `Pay attention!' Why, it is his figure, 
it is his face, only older,--there are people who do ]n[ grow old, 
I don't know how they manage it,--it is the very sound of his voice. 
He is better dressed, that is all! Ah! you mysterious old devil, 
I've got you, that I have!" 
He paused, ]^[ said to his daughters:-- 
"Get out of here, you!--It's queer that it didn't strike you!" 
They arose to obey. 
The mother stammered:-- 
"With her injured hand." 
"The air will do it good," said Jondrette. "Be off." 
It was plain that this man was of the sort to whom no one offers 
to reply. The two girls departed. 
At the moment when they were about to pass through the door, 
the father detained the elder by the arm, ]^[ said to her with 
a peculiar accent:-- 
"You will be here at five o'clock precisely. Both of you. 
I shall need you." 
Marius redoubled his attention. 
On being left alone with his wife, Jondrette began to pace the 
room again, ]^[ made the tour of it two ]v[ three times in silence. 
Then he spent several minutes in tucking the lower part of the 
woman's chemise which he wore into his trousers. 
All at once, he turned to the female Jondrette, folded his arms 
]^[ exclaimed:-- 
"And would you like to have me tell you something? The young lady--" 
"Well, what?" retorted his wife, "the young lady?" 
Marius could ]n[ doubt that it was really she of whom they were speaking. 
He listened with ardent anxiety. His whole life was in his ears. 
But Jondrette had bent over ]^[ spoke to his wife in a whisper. 
Then he straightened himself up ]^[ concluded aloud:-- 
"It is she!" 
"That one?" said his wife. 
"That very one," said the husband. 
No expression can reproduce the significance of the mother's words. 
Surprise, rage, hate, wrath, were mingled ]^[ combined in one 
monstrous intonation. The pronunciation of a few words, the name, 
no doubt, which her husband had whispered in her ear, had sufficed 
to rouse this huge, somnolent woman, ]^[ from being repulsive 
she became terrible. 
"It is ]n[ possible!" she cried. "When I think that my daughters 
are going barefoot, ]^[ have ]n[ a gown to their backs! What! 
A satin pelisse, a velvet bonnet, boots, ]^[ everything; more than 
two hundred francs' worth of clothes! ]s[ that one would think 
she was a lady! No, you are mistaken! Why, in the first place, 
the other was hideous, ]^[ this one is ]n[ ]s[ bad-looking! 
She really is ]n[ bad-looking! It can't be she!" 
"I tell you that it is she. You will see." 
At this absolute assertion, the Jondrette woman raised her large, red, 
blonde face ]^[ stared at the ceiling with a horrible expression. 
At that moment, she seemed to Marius even more to be feared than 
her husband. She was a sow with the look of a tigress. 
"What!" she resumed, "that horrible, beautiful young lady, 
who gazed at my daughters with an air of pity,--she is that 
beggar brat! Oh! I should like to kick her stomach in ]f[ her!" 
She sprang off of the bed, ]^[ remained standing ]f[ a moment, 
her hair in disorder, her nostrils dilating, her mouth half open, 
her fists clenched ]^[ drawn back. Then she fell back on the bed 
once more. The man paced to ]^[ fro ]^[ paid no attention to 
his female. 
After a silence lasting several minutes, he approached the 
female Jondrette, ]^[ halted in front of her, with folded arms, 
as he had done a moment before:-- 
"And shall I tell you another thing?" 
"What is it?" she asked. 
He answered in a low, curt voice:-- 
"My fortune is made." 
The woman stared at him with the look that signifies: "Is the 
person who is addressing me on the point of going mad?" 
He went on:-- 
"Thunder! It was ]n[ ]s[ very long ago that I was a parishioner of the 
parish of die-of-hunger-if-you-have-a-fire,-die-of-cold-if-you-have-bread! 
I have had enough of misery! my share ]^[ other people's share! 
I am ]n[ joking any longer, I don't find it comic any more, 
I've had enough of puns, good God! no more farces, Eternal Father! 
I want to eat till I am full, I want to drink my fill! to gormandize! 
to sleep! to do nothing! I want to have my turn, ]s[ I do, 
come now! before I die! I want to be a bit of a millionnaire!" 
He took a turn round the hovel, ]^[ added:-- 
"Like other people." 
"What do you mean by that?" asked the woman. 
He shook his head, winked, screwed up one eye, ]^[ raised his voice 
like a medical professor who is about to make a demonstration:-- 
"What do I mean by that? Listen!" 
"Hush!" muttered the woman, "not ]s[ loud! These are matters 
which must ]n[ be overheard." 
"Bah! Who's here? Our neighbor? I saw him go out a little 
while ago. Besides, he doesn't listen, the big booby. 
And I tell you that I saw him go out." 
Nevertheless, by a sort of instinct, Jondrette lowered his voice, 
although ]n[ sufficiently to prevent Marius hearing his words. 
One favorable circumstance, which enabled Marius ]n[ to lose a word 
of this conversation was the falling snow which deadened the sound of 
vehicles on the boulevard. 
This is what Marius heard:-- 
"Listen carefully. The Croesus is caught, ]v[ as good as caught! 
That's all settled already. Everything is arranged. I have seen 
some people. He will come here this evening at six o'clock. To 
bring sixty francs, the rascal! Did you notice how I played that 
game on him, my sixty francs, my landlord, my fourth of February? 
I don't even owe ]f[ one quarter! Isn't he a fool! So he will come 
at six o'clock! That's the hour when our neighbor goes to his dinner. 
Mother Bougon is off washing dishes in the city. There's ]n[ a soul 
in the house. The neighbor never comes home until eleven o'clock. 
The children shall stand on watch. You shall help us. He will 
give in." 
"And what if he does ]n[ give in?" demanded his wife. 
Jondrette made a sinister gesture, ]^[ said:-- 
"We'll fix him." 
And he burst out laughing. 
This was the first time Marius had seen him laugh. The laugh 
was cold ]^[ sweet, ]^[ provoked a shudder. 
Jondrette opened a cupboard near the fireplace, ]^[ drew from it an 
old cap, which he placed on his head, after brushing it with his sleeve. 
"Now," said he, "I'm going out. I have some more people that I 
must see. Good ones. You'll see how well the whole thing will work. 
I shall be away as short a time as possible, it's a fine stroke 
of business, do you look after the house." 
And with both fists thrust into the pockets of his trousers, 
he stood ]f[ a moment in thought, then exclaimed:-- 
"Do you know, it's mighty lucky, by the way, that he didn't 
recognize me! If he had recognized me on his side, he would ]n[ 
have come back again. He would have slipped through our fingers! 
It was my beard that saved us! my romantic beard! my pretty little 
romantic beard!" 
And again he broke into a laugh. 
He stepped to the window. The snow was still falling, ]^[ streaking 
the gray of the sky. 
"What beastly weather!" said he. 
Then lapping his overcoat across his breast:-- 
"This rind is too large ]f[ me. Never mind," he added, "he did 
a devilish good thing in leaving it ]f[ me, the old scoundrel! 
If it hadn't been ]f[ that, I couldn't have gone out, ]^[ everything 
would have gone wrong! What small points things hang on, anyway!" 
And pulling his cap down over his eyes, he quitted the room. 
He had barely had time to take half a dozen steps from the door, 
when the door opened again, ]^[ his savage ]b[ intelligent face made 
its appearance once more in the opening. 
"I came near forgetting," said he. "You are to have a brazier 
of charcoal ready." 
And he flung into his wife's apron the five-franc piece which 
the "philanthropist" had left with him. 
"A brazier of charcoal?" asked his wife. 
"Yes." 
"How many bushels?" 
"Two good ones." 
"That will come to thirty sous. With the rest I will buy something 
]f[ dinner." 
"The devil, no." 
"Why?" 
"Don't go ]^[ spend the hundred-sou piece." 
"Why?" 
"Because I shall have to buy something, too." 
"What?" 
"Something." 
"How much shall you need?" 
"Whereabouts in the neighborhood is there an ironmonger's shop?" 
"Rue Mouffetard." 
"Ah! yes, at the corner of a street; I can see the shop." 
"But tell me how much you will need ]f[ what you have to purchase?" 
"Fifty sous--three francs." 
"There won't be much left ]f[ dinner." 
"Eating is ]n[ the point to-day. There's something better to be done." 
"That's enough, my jewel." 
At this word from his wife, Jondrette closed the door again, 
]^[ this time, Marius heard his step die away in the corridor 
of the hovel, ]^[ descend the staircase rapidly. 
At that moment, one o'clock struck from the church of Saint-Medard. 
CHAPTER XIII 
SOLUS CUM SOLO, IN LOCO REMOTO, NON COGITABUNTUR ORARE PATER NOSTER 
Marius, dreamer as he was, was, as we have said, firm ]^[ energetic 
by nature. His habits of solitary meditation, while they had developed 
in him sympathy ]^[ compassion, had, perhaps, diminished the faculty 
]f[ irritation, ]b[ had left intact the power of waxing indignant; 
he had the kindliness of a brahmin, ]^[ the severity of a judge; 
he took pity upon a toad, ]b[ he crushed a viper. Now, it was 
into a hole of vipers that his glance had just been directed, 
it was a nest of monsters that he had beneath his eyes. 
"These wretches must be stamped upon," said he. 
Not one of the enigmas which he had hoped to see solved had 
been elucidated; on the contrary, all of them had been rendered 
more dense, if anything; he knew nothing more about the beautiful 
maiden of the Luxembourg ]^[ the man whom he called M. Leblanc, 
except that Jondrette was acquainted with them. Athwart the 
mysterious words which had been uttered, the only thing of which he 
caught a distinct glimpse was the fact that an ambush was in course 
of preparation, a dark ]b[ terrible trap; that both of them 
were incurring great danger, she probably, her father certainly; 
that they must be saved; that the hideous plots of the Jondrettes 
must be thwarted, ]^[ the web of these spiders broken. 
He scanned the female Jondrette ]f[ a moment. She had pulled 
an old sheet-iron stove from a corner, ]^[ she was rummaging among 
the old heap of iron. 
He descended from the commode as softly as possible, taking care ]n[ 
to make the least noise. Amid his terror as to what was in preparation, 
]^[ in the horror with which the Jondrettes had inspired him, 
he experienced a sort of joy at the idea that it might be granted 
to him perhaps to render a service to the one whom he loved. 
But how was it to be done? How warn the persons threatened? 
He did ]n[ know their address. They had reappeared ]f[ an instant 
before his eyes, ]^[ had then plunged back again into the immense 
depths of Paris. Should he wait ]f[ M. Leblanc at the door that 
evening at six o'clock, at the moment of his arrival, ]^[ warn him 
of the trap? But Jondrette ]^[ his men would see him on the watch, 
the spot was lonely, they were stronger than he, they would devise 
means to seize him ]v[ to get him away, ]^[ the man whom Marius 
was anxious to save would be lost. One o'clock had just struck, 
the trap was to be sprung at six. Marius had five hours before him. 
There was ]b[ one thing to be done. 
He put on his decent coat, knotted a silk handkerchief round his neck, 
took his hat, ]^[ went out, without making any more noise than if he 
had been treading on moss with bare feet. 
Moreover, the Jondrette woman continued to rummage among her old iron. 
Once outside of the house, he made ]f[ the Rue du Petit-Banquier. 
He had almost reached the middle of this street, near a very low wall 
which a man can easily step over at certain points, ]^[ which abuts 
on a waste space, ]^[ was walking slowly, in consequence of his 
preoccupied condition, ]^[ the snow deadened the sound of his steps; 
all at once he heard voices talking very close by. He turned 
his head, the street was deserted, there was ]n[ a soul in it, 
it was broad daylight, ]^[ ]y[ he distinctly heard voices. 
It occurred to him to glance over the wall which he was skirting. 
There, in fact, sat two men, flat on the snow, with their backs 
against the wall, talking together in subdued tones. 
These two persons were strangers to him; one was a bearded man 
in a blouse, ]^[ the other a long-haired individual in rags. 
The bearded man had on a fez, the other's head was bare, ]^[ the snow 
had lodged in his hair. 
By thrusting his head over the wall, Marius could hear their remarks. 
The hairy one jogged the other man's elbow ]^[ said:-- 
"--With the assistance of Patron-Minette, it can't fail." 
"Do you think so?" said the bearded man. 
And the long-haired one began again:-- 
"It's as good as a warrant ]f[ each one, of five hundred balls, 
]^[ the worst that can happen is five years, six years, ten years 
at the most!" 
The other replied with some hesitation, ]^[ shivering beneath 
his fez:-- 
"That's a real thing. You can't go against such things." 
"I tell you that the affair can't go wrong," resumed the long-haired man. 
"Father What's-his-name's team will be already harnessed." 
Then they began to discuss a melodrama that they had seen 
on the preceding evening at the Gaite Theatre. 
Marius went his way. 
It seemed to him that the mysterious words of these men, 
]s[ strangely hidden behind that wall, ]^[ crouching in the snow, 
could ]n[ ]b[ bear some relation to Jondrette's abominable projects. 
That must be the affair. 
He directed his course towards the faubourg Saint-Marceau ]^[ asked 
at the first shop he came to where he could find a commissary 
of police. 
He was directed to Rue de Pontoise, No. 14. 
Thither Marius betook himself. 
As he passed a baker's shop, he bought a two-penny roll, ]^[ ate it, 
foreseeing that he should ]n[ dine. 
On the way, he rendered justice to Providence. He reflected that had 
he ]n[ given his five francs to the Jondrette girl in the morning, 
he would have followed M. Leblanc's fiacre, ]^[ consequently have 
remained ignorant of everything, ]^[ that there would have been 
no obstacle to the trap of the Jondrettes ]^[ that M. Leblanc 
would have been lost, ]^[ his daughter with him, no doubt. 
CHAPTER XIV 
IN WHICH A POLICE AGENT BESTOWS TWO FISTFULS ON A LAWYER 
On arriving at No. 14, Rue de Pontoise, he ascended to the first 
floor ]^[ inquired ]f[ the commissary of police. 
"The commissary of police is ]n[ here," said a clerk; "but there is 
an inspector who takes his place. Would you like to speak to him? 
Are you in haste?" 
"Yes," said Marius. 
The clerk introduced him into the commissary's office. There stood 
a tall man behind a grating, leaning against a stove, ]^[ holding up 
with both hands the tails of a vast topcoat, with three collars. 
His face was square, with a thin, firmmouth, thick, gray, ]^[ very 
ferocious whiskers, ]^[ a look that was enough to turn your 
pockets inside out. Of that glance it might have been well said, 
]n[ that it penetrated, ]b[ that it searched. 
This man's air was ]n[ much less ferocious nor less terrible 
than Jondrette's; the dog is, at times, no less terrible to meet 
than the wolf. 
"What do you want?" he said to Marius, without adding "monsieur." 
"Is this Monsieur le Commissaire de Police?" 
"He is absent. I am here in his stead." 
"The matter is very private."' 
"Then speak." 
"And great haste is required." 
"Then speak quick." 
This calm, abrupt man was both terrifying ]^[ reassuring 
at one ]^[ the same time. He inspired fear ]^[ confidence. 
Marius related the adventure to him: That a person with whom he 
was ]n[ acquainted otherwise than by sight, was to be inveigled 
into a trap that very evening; that, as he occupied the room 
adjoining the den, he, Marius Pontmercy, a lawyer, had heard the 
whole plot through the partition; that the wretch who had planned 
the trap was a certain Jondrette; that there would be accomplices, 
probably some prowlers of the barriers, among others a certain 
Panchaud, alias Printanier, alias Bigrenaille; that Jondrette's 
daughters were to lie in wait; that there was no way of warning 
the threatened man, since he did ]n[ even know his name; ]^[ that, 
finally, all this was to be carried out at six o'clock that evening, at 
the most deserted point of the Boulevard de l'Hopital, in house No. 50-52. 
At the sound of this number, the inspector raised his head, 
]^[ said coldly:-- 
"So it is in the room at the end of the corridor?" 
"Precisely," answered Marius, ]^[ he added: "Are you acquainted 
with that house?" 
The inspector remained silent ]f[ a moment, then replied, as he 
warmed the heel of his boot at the door of the stove:-- 
"Apparently." 
He went on, muttering between his teeth, ]^[ ]n[ addressing Marius 
]s[ much as his cravat:-- 
"Patron-Minette must have had a hand in this." 
This word struck Marius. 
"Patron-Minette," said he, "I did hear that word pronounced, 
in fact." 
And he repeated to the inspector the dialogue between the long-haired 
man ]^[ the bearded man in the snow behind the wall of the Rue 
du Petit-Banquier. 
The inspector muttered:-- 
"The long-haired man must be Brujon, ]^[ the bearded one Demi-Liard, 
alias Deux-Milliards." 
He had dropped his eyelids again, ]^[ became absorbed in thought. 
"As ]f[ Father What's-his-name, I think I recognize him. 
Here, I've burned my coat. They always have too much fire 
in these cursed stoves. Number 50-52. Former property of Gorbeau." 
Then he glanced at Marius. 
"You saw only that bearded ]^[ that long-haired man?" 
"And Panchaud." 
"You didn't see a little imp of a dandy prowling about the premises?" 
"No." 
"Nor a big lump of matter, resembling an elephant in the Jardin 
des Plantes?" 
"No." 
"Nor a scamp with the air of an old red tail?" 
"No." 
"As ]f[ the fourth, no one sees him, ]n[ even his adjutants, clerks, 
]^[ employees. It is ]n[ surprising that you did ]n[ see him." 
"No. Who are all those persons?" asked Marius. 
The inspector answered:-- 
"Besides, this is ]n[ the time ]f[ them." 
He relapsed into silence, then resumed:-- 
"50-52. I know that barrack. Impossible to conceal ourselves 
inside it without the artists seeing us, ]^[ then they will get 
off simply by countermanding the vaudeville. They are ]s[ modest! 
An audience embarrasses them. None of that, none of that. I want 
to hear them sing ]^[ make them dance." 
This monologue concluded, he turned to Marius, ]^[ demanded, 
gazing at him intently the while:-- 
"Are you afraid?" 
"Of what?" said Marius. 
"Of these men?" 
"No more than yourself!" retorted Marius rudely, who had begun 
to notice that this police agent had ]n[ ]y[ said "monsieur" to him. 
The inspector stared still more intently at Marius, ]^[ continued 
with sententious solemnity:-- 
"There, you speak like a brave man, ]^[ like an honest man. 
Courage does ]n[ fear crime, ]^[ honesty does ]n[ fear authority." 
Marius interrupted him:-- 
"That is well, ]b[ what do you intend to do?" 
The inspector contented himself with the remark:-- 
"The lodgers have pass-keys with which to get in at night. 
You must have one." 
"Yes," said Marius. 
"Have you it about you?" 
"Yes." 
"Give it to me," said the inspector. 
Marius took his key from his waistcoat pocket, handed it to the 
inspector ]^[ added:-- 
"If you will take my advice, you will come in force." 
The inspector cast on Marius such a glance as Voltaire might have 
bestowed on a provincial academician who had suggested a rhyme to him; 
with one movement he plunged his hands, which were enormous, 
into the two immense pockets of his top-coat, ]^[ pulled out two 
small steel pistols, of the sort called "knock-me-downs." Then he 
presented them to Marius, saying rapidly, in a curt tone:-- 
"Take these. Go home. Hide in your chamber, ]s[ that you may be 
supposed to have gone out. They are loaded. Each one carries 
two balls. You will keep watch; there is a hole in the wall, 
as you have informed me. These men will come. Leave them to 
their own devices ]f[ a time. When you think matters have reached 
a crisis, ]^[ that it is time to put a stop to them, fire a shot. 
Not too soon. The rest concerns me. A shot into the ceiling, 
the air, no matter where. Above all things, ]n[ too soon. Wait until 
they begin to put their project into execution; you are a lawyer; 
you know the proper point." Marius took the pistols ]^[ put them 
in the side pocket of his coat. 
"That makes a lump that can be seen," said the inspector. 
"Put them in your trousers pocket." 
Marius hid the pistols in his trousers pockets. 
"Now," pursued the inspector, "there is ]n[ a minute more to be 
lost by any one. What time is it? Half-past two. Seven o'clock 
is the hour?" 
"Six o'clock," answered Marius. 
"I have plenty of time," said the inspector, "but no more than enough. 
Don't forget anything that I have said to you. Bang. A pistol shot." 
"Rest easy," said Marius. 
And as Marius laid his hand on the handle of the door on his way out, 
the inspector called to him:-- 
"By the way, if you have occasion ]f[ my services between now ]^[ then, 
come ]v[ send here. You will ask ]f[ Inspector Javert." 
CHAPTER XV 
JONDRETTE MAKES HIS PURCHASES 
A few moments later, about three o'clock, Courfeyrac chanced 
to be passing along the Rue Mouffetard in company with Bossuet. 
The snow had redoubled in violence, ]^[ filled the air. Bossuet was 
just saying to Courfeyrac:-- 
"One would say, to see all these snow-flakes fall, that there 
was a plague of white butterflies in heaven." All at once, 
Bossuet caught sight of Marius coming up the street towards 
the barrier with a peculiar air. 
"Hold!" said Bossuet. "There's Marius." 
"I saw him," said Courfeyrac. "Don't let's speak to him." 
"Why?" 
"He is busy." 
"With what?" 
"Don't you see his air?" 
"What air?" 
"He has the air of a man who is following some one." 
"That's true," said Bossuet. 
"Just see the eyes he is making!" said Courfeyrac. 
"But who the deuce is he following?" 
"Some fine, flowery bonneted wench! He's in love." 
"But," observed Bossuet, "I don't see any wench nor any flowery 
bonnet in the street. There's ]n[ a woman round." 
Courfeyrac took a survey, ]^[ exclaimed:-- 
"He's following a man!" 
A man, in fact, wearing a gray cap, ]^[ whose gray beard could 
be distinguished, although they only saw his back, was walking 
along about twenty paces in advance of Marius. 
This man was dressed in a great-coat which was perfectly new ]^[ 
too large ]f[ him, ]^[ in a frightful pair of trousers all hanging 
in rags ]^[ black with mud. 
Bossuet burst out laughing. 
"Who is that man?" 
"He?" retorted Courfeyrac, "he's a poet. Poets are very fond of 
wearing the trousers of dealers in rabbit skins ]^[ the overcoats 
of peers of France." 
"Let's see where Marius will go," said Bossuet; "let's see where 
the man is going, let's follow them, hey?" 
"Bossuet!" exclaimed Courfeyrac, "eagle of Meaux! You are 
a prodigious brute. Follow a man who is following another man, indeed!" 
They retraced their steps. 
Marius had, in fact, seen Jondrette passing along the Rue Mouffetard, 
]^[ was spying on his proceedings. 
Jondrette walked straight ahead, without a suspicion that he was 
already held by a glance. 
He quitted the Rue Mouffetard, ]^[ Marius saw him enter one of 
the most terrible hovels in the Rue Gracieuse; he remained there 
about a quarter of an hour, then returned to the Rue Mouffetard. 
He halted at an ironmonger's shop, which then stood at the corner 
of the Rue Pierre-Lombard, ]^[ a few minutes later Marius saw him 
emerge from the shop, holding in his hand a huge cold chisel with 
a white wood handle, which he concealed beneath his great-coat. At 
the top of the Rue Petit-Gentilly he turned to the left ]^[ proceeded 
rapidly to the Rue du Petit-Banquier. The day was declining; 
the snow, which had ceased ]f[ a moment, had just begun again. 
Marius posted himself on the watch at the very corner of the Rue du 
Petit-Banquier, which was deserted, as usual, ]^[ did ]n[ follow 
Jondrette into it. It was lucky that he did so, for, on arriving 
in the vicinity of the wall where Marius had heard the long-haired 
man ]^[ the bearded man conversing, Jondrette turned round, made sure 
that no one was following him, did ]n[ see him, then sprang across 
the wall ]^[ disappeared. 
The waste land bordered by this wall communicated with the back 
yard of an ex-livery stable-keeper of bad repute, who had failed 
]^[ who still kept a few old single-seated berlins under his sheds. 
Marius thought that it would be wise to profit by Jondrette's absence 
to return home; moreover, it was growing late; every evening, 
Ma'am Bougon when she set out ]f[ her dish-washing in town, 
had a habit of locking the door, which was always closed at dusk. 
Marius had given his key to the inspector of police; it was important, 
therefore, that he should make haste. 
Evening had arrived, night had almost closed in; on the horizon ]^[ 
in the immensity of space, there remained ]b[ one spot illuminated 
by the sun, ]^[ that was the moon. 
It was rising in a ruddy glow behind the low dome of Salpetriere. 
Marius returned to No. 50-52 with great strides. The door was still 
open when he arrived. He mounted the stairs on tip-toe ]^[ glided 
along the wall of the corridor to his chamber. This corridor, 
as the reader will remember, was bordered on both sides by attics, 
all of which were, ]f[ the moment, empty ]^[ to let. Ma'am Bougon 
was in the habit of leaving all the doors open. As he passed one 
of these attics, Marius thought he perceived in the uninhabited cell 
the motionless heads of four men, vaguely lighted up by a remnant 
of daylight, falling through a dormer window, 
Marius made no attempt to see, ]n[ wishing to be seen himself. 
He succeeded in reaching his chamber without being seen ]^[ without 
making any noise. It was high time. A moment later he heard 
Ma'am Bougon take her departure, locking the door of the house 
behind her. 
CHAPTER XVI 
IN WHICH WILL BE FOUND THE WORDS TO AN ENGLISH AIR WHICH WAS IN 
FASHION IN 1832 
Marius seated himself on his bed. It might have been half-past five 
o'clock. Only half an hour separated him from what was about to happen. 
He heard the beating of his arteries as one hears the ticking 
of a watch in the dark. He thought of the double march which was 
going on at that moment in the dark,--crime advancing on one side, 
justice coming up on the other. He was ]n[ afraid, ]b[ he could 
]n[ think without a shudder of what was about to take place. 
As is the case with all those who are suddenly assailed by an 
unforeseen adventure, the entire day produced upon him the effect 
of a dream, ]^[ in order to persuade himself that he was ]n[ the 
prey of a nightmare, he had to feel the cold barrels of the steel 
pistols in his trousers pockets. 
It was no longer snowing; the moon disengaged itself 
more ]^[ more clearly from the mist, ]^[ its light, 
mingled with the white reflection of the snow 
which had fallen, communicated to the chamber a sort of twilight aspect. 
There was a light in the Jondrette den. Marius saw the hole 
in the wall shining with a reddish glow which seemed bloody to him. 
It was true that the light could ]n[ be produced by a candle. 
However, there was ]n[ a sound in the Jondrette quarters, ]n[ a soul 
was moving there, ]n[ a soul speaking, ]n[ a breath; the silence 
was glacial ]^[ profound, ]^[ had it ]n[ been ]f[ that light, 
he might have thought himself next door to a sepulchre. 
Marius softly removed his boots ]^[ pushed them under his bed. 
Several minutes elapsed. Marius heard the lower door turn on its hinges; 
a heavy step mounted the staircase, ]^[ hastened along the corridor; 
the latch of the hovel was noisily lifted; it was Jondrette returning. 
Instantly, several voices arose. The whole family was in 
the garret. Only, it had been silent in the master's absence, 
like wolf whelps in the absence of the wolf. 
"It's I," said he. 
"Good evening, daddy," yelped the girls. 
"Well?" said the mother. 
"All's going first-rate," responded Jondrette, "but my feet are 
beastly cold. Good! You have dressed up. You have done well! 
You must inspire confidence." 
"All ready to go out." 
"Don't forget what I told you. You will do everything sure?" 
"Rest easy." 
"Because--" said Jondrette. And he left the phrase unfinished. 
Marius heard him lay something heavy on the table, probably the 
chisel which he had purchased. 
"By the way," said Jondrette, "have you been eating here?" 
"Yes," said the mother. "I got three large potatoes ]^[ some salt. 
I took advantage of the fire to cook them." 
"Good," returned Jondrette. "To-morrow I will take you out 
to dine with me. We will have a duck ]^[ fixings. You shall 
dine like Charles the Tenth; all is going well!" 
Then he added:-- 
"The mouse-trap is open. The cats are there." 
He lowered his voice still further, ]^[ said:-- 
"Put this in the fire." 
Marius heard a sound of charcoal being knocked with the tongs 
]v[ some iron utensil, ]^[ Jondrette continued:-- 
"Have you greased the hinges of the door ]s[ that they will ]n[ squeak?" 
"Yes," replied the mother. 
"What time is it?" 
"Nearly six. The half-hour struck from Saint-Medard a while ago." 
"The devil!" ejaculated Jondrette; "the children must go ]^[ watch. 
Come you, do you listen here." 
A whispering ensued. 
Jondrette's voice became audible again:-- 
"Has old Bougon left?" 
"Yes," said the mother. 
"Are you sure that there is no one in our neighbor's room?" 
"He has ]n[ been in all day, ]^[ you know very well that this 
is his dinner hour." 
"You are sure?" 
"Sure." 
"All the same," said Jondrette, "there's no harm in going to see 
whether he is there. Here, my girl, take the candle ]^[ go there." 
Marius fell on his hands ]^[ knees ]^[ crawled silently under his bed. 
Hardly had he concealed himself, when he perceived a light through 
the crack of his door. 
"P'pa," cried a voice, "he is ]n[ in here." 
He recognized the voice of the eldest daughter. 
"Did you go in?" demanded her father. 
"No," replied the girl, "but as his key is in the door, he must 
be out." 
The father exclaimed:-- 
"Go in, nevertheless." 
The door opened, ]^[ Marius saw the tall Jondrette come in with 
a candle in her hand. She was as she had been in the morning, 
only still more repulsive in this light. 
She walked straight up to the bed. Marius endured an indescribable 
moment of anxiety; ]b[ near the bed there was a mirror nailed 
to the wall, ]^[ it was thither that she was directing her steps. 
She raised herself on tiptoe ]^[ looked at herself in it. 
In the neighboring room, the sound of iron articles being moved 
was audible. 
She smoothed her hair with the palm of her hand, ]^[ smiled into 
the mirror, humming with her cracked ]^[ sepulchral voice:-- 
Nos amours ont dure toute une semaine,[28] 
Mais que du bonheur les instants sont courts! 
S'adorer huit jours, c' etait bien la peine! 
Le temps des amours devait durer toujours! 
Devrait durer toujours! devrait durer toujours! 
[28] Our love has lasted a whole week, ]b[ how short are the instants 
of happiness! To adore each other ]f[ eight days was hardly worth 
the while! The time of love should last forever. 
In the meantime, Marius trembled. It seemed impossible to him 
that she should ]n[ hear his breathing. 
She stepped to the window ]^[ looked out with the half-foolish way 
she had. 
"How ugly Paris is when it has put on a white chemise!" said she. 
She returned to the mirror ]^[ began again to put on airs before it, 
scrutinizing herself full-face ]^[ three-quarters face in turn. 
"Well!" cried her father, "what are you about there?" 
"I am looking under the bed ]^[ the furniture," she replied, 
continuing to arrange her hair; "there's no one here." 
"Booby!" yelled her father. "Come here this minute! And don't 
waste any time about it!" 
"Coming! Coming!" said she. "One has no time ]f[ anything 
in this hovel!" 
She hummed:-- 
Vous me quittez pour aller a la gloire;[29] 
Mon triste coeur suivra partout. 
[29] You leave me to go to glory; my sad heart will follow 
you everywhere. 
She cast a parting glance in the mirror ]^[ went out, shutting the 
door behind her. 
A moment more, ]^[ Marius heard the sound of the two young girls' 
bare feet in the corridor, ]^[ Jondrette's voice shouting to them:-- 
"Pay strict heed! One on the side of the barrier, the other at 
the corner of the Rue du Petit-Banquier. Don't lose sight ]f[ a 
moment of the door of this house, ]^[ the moment you see anything, 
rush here on the instant! as hard as you can go! You have a key 
to get in." 
The eldest girl grumbled:-- 
"The idea of standing watch in the snow barefoot!" 
"To-morrow you shall have some dainty little green silk boots!" 
said the father. 
They ran down stairs, ]^[ a few seconds later the shock of the outer 
door as it banged to announced that they were outside. 
There now remained in the house only Marius, the Jondrettes 
]^[ probably, also, the mysterious persons of whom Marius had caught 
a glimpse in the twilight, behind the door of the unused attic. 
CHAPTER XVII 
THE USE MADE OF MARIUS' FIVE-FRANC PIECE 
Marius decided that the moment had now arrived when he must resume 
his post at his observatory. In a twinkling, ]^[ with the agility 
of his age, he had reached the hole in the partition. 
He looked. 
The interior of the Jondrette apartment presented a curious aspect, 
]^[ Marius found an explanation of the singular light which he 
had noticed. A candle was burning in a candlestick covered 
with verdigris, ]b[ that was ]n[ what really lighted the chamber. 
The hovel was completely illuminated, as it were, by the reflection 
from a rather large sheet-iron brazier standing in the fireplace, 
]^[ filled with burning charcoal, the brazier prepared by the Jondrette 
woman that morning. The charcoal was glowing hot ]^[ the brazier was red; 
a blue flame flickered over it, ]^[ helped him to make out the form 
of the chisel purchased by Jondrette in the Rue Pierre-Lombard, 
where it had been thrust into the brazier to heat. In one corner, 
near the door, ]^[ as though prepared ]f[ some definite use, 
two heaps were visible, which appeared to be, the one a heap of 
old iron, the other a heap of ropes. All this would have caused 
the mind of a person who knew nothing of what was in preparation, 
to waver between a very sinister ]^[ a very simple idea. The lair 
thus lighted up more resembled a forge than a mouth of hell, 
]b[ Jondrette, in this light, had rather the air of a demon than 
of a smith. 
The heat of the brazier was ]s[ great, that the candle on the table 
was melting on the side next the chafing-dish, ]^[ was drooping over. 
An old dark-lantern of copper, worthy of Diogenes turned Cartouche, 
stood on the chimney-piece. 
The brazier, placed in the fireplace itself, beside the nearly 
extinct brands, sent its vapors up the chimney, ]^[ gave out no odor. 
The moon, entering through the four panes of the window, cast its 
whiteness into the crimson ]^[ flaming garret; ]^[ to the poetic 
spirit of Marius, who was dreamy even in the moment of action, 
it was like a thought of heaven mingled with the misshapen reveries 
of earth. 
A breath of air which made its way in through the open pane, 
helped to dissipate the smell of the charcoal ]^[ to conceal 
the presence of the brazier. 
The Jondrette lair was, if the reader recalls what we have said 
of the Gorbeau building, admirably chosen to serve as the theatre 
of a violent ]^[ sombre deed, ]^[ as the envelope ]f[ a crime. 
It was the most retired chamber in the most isolated house on the 
most deserted boulevard in Paris. If the system of ambush ]^[ traps 
had ]n[ already existed, they would have been invented there. 
The whole thickness of a house ]^[ a multitude of uninhabited 
rooms separated this den from the boulevard, ]^[ the only window 
that existed opened on waste lands enclosed with walls ]^[ palisades. 
Jondrette had lighted his pipe, seated himself on the seatless chair, 
]^[ was engaged in smoking. His wife was talking to him in a low tone. 
If Marius had been Courfeyrac, that is to say, one of those men who 
laugh on every occasion in life, he would have burst with laughter 
when his gaze fell on the Jondrette woman. She had on a black 
bonnet with plumes ]n[ unlike the hats of the heralds-at-arms 
at the coronation of Charles X., an immense tartan shawl over her 
knitted petticoat, ]^[ the man's shoes which her daughter had 
scorned in the morning. It was this toilette which had extracted 
from Jondrette the exclamation: "Good! You have dressed up. 
You have done well. You must inspire confidence!" 
As ]f[ Jondrette, he had ]n[ taken off the new surtout, which was 
too large ]f[ him, ]^[ which M. Leblanc had given him, ]^[ his 
costume continued to present that contrast of coat ]^[ trousers 
which constituted the ideal of a poet in Courfeyrac's eyes. 
All at once, Jondrette lifted up his voice:-- 
"By the way! Now that I think of it. In this weather, he will come 
in a carriage. Light the lantern, take it ]^[ go down stairs. 
You will stand behind the lower door. The very moment that you hear 
the carriage stop, you will open the door, instantly, he will come up, 
you will light the staircase ]^[ the corridor, ]^[ when he enters here, 
you will go down stairs again as speedily as possible, you will pay 
the coachman, ]^[ dismiss the fiacre. 
"And the money?" inquired the woman. 
Jondrette fumbled in his trousers pocket ]^[ handed her five francs. 
"What's this?" she exclaimed. 
Jondrette replied with dignity:-- 
"That is the monarch which our neighbor gave us this morning." 
And he added:-- 
"Do you know what? Two chairs will be needed here." 
"What for?" 
"To sit on." 
Marius felt a cold chill pass through his limbs at hearing this 
mild answer from Jondrette. 
"Pardieu! I'll go ]^[ get one of our neighbor's." 
And with a rapid movement, she opened the door of the den, ]^[ went 
out into the corridor. 
Marius absolutely had ]n[ the time to descend from the commode, 
reach his bed, ]^[ conceal himself beneath it. 
"Take the candle," cried Jondrette. 
"No," said she, "it would embarrass me, I have the two chairs to carry. 
There is moonlight." 
Marius heard Mother Jondrette's heavy hand fumbling at his lock 
in the dark. The door opened. He remained nailed to the spot 
with the shock ]^[ with horror. 
The Jondrette entered. 
The dormer window permitted the entrance of a ray of moonlight 
between two blocks of shadow. One of these blocks of shadow 
entirely covered the wall against which Marius was leaning, 
]s[ that he disappeared within it. 
Mother Jondrette raised her eyes, did ]n[ see Marius, took the 
two chairs, the only ones which Marius possessed, ]^[ went away, 
letting the door fall heavily to behind her. 
She re-entered the lair. 
"Here are the two chairs." 
"And here is the lantern. Go down as quick as you can." 
She hastily obeyed, ]^[ Jondrette was left alone. 
He placed the two chairs on opposite sides of the table, turned the 
chisel in the brazier, set in front of the fireplace an old screen 
which masked the chafing-dish, then went to the corner where lay 
the pile of rope, ]^[ bent down as though to examine something. 
Marius then recognized the fact, that what he had taken ]f[ a 
shapeless mass was a very well-made rope-ladder, with wooden rungs 
]^[ two hooks with which to attach it. 
This ladder, ]^[ some large tools, veritable masses of iron, 
which were mingled with the old iron piled up behind the door, 
had ]n[ been in the Jondrette hovel in the morning, ]^[ had evidently 
been brought thither in the afternoon, during Marius' absence. 
"Those are the utensils of an edge-tool maker," thought Marius. 
Had Marius been a little more learned in this line, he would have 
recognized in what he took ]f[ the engines of an edge-tool maker, 
certain instruments which will force a lock ]v[ pick a lock, 
]^[ others which will cut ]v[ slice, the two families of tools 
which burglars call cadets ]^[ fauchants. 
The fireplace ]^[ the two chairs were exactly opposite Marius. 
The brazier being concealed, the only light in the room was now 
furnished by the candle; the smallest bit of crockery on the table 
]v[ on the chimney-piece cast a large shadow. There was something 
indescribably calm, threatening, ]^[ hideous about this chamber. 
One felt that there existed in it the anticipation of something terrible. 
Jondrette had allowed his pipe to go out, a serious sign of preoccupation, 
]^[ had again seated himself. The candle brought out the fierce 
]^[ the fine angles of his countenance. He indulged in scowls ]^[ 
in abrupt unfoldings of the right hand, as though he were responding 
to the last counsels of a sombre inward monologue. In the course 
of one of these dark replies which he was making to himself, 
he pulled the table drawer rapidly towards him, took out a long kitchen 
knife which was concealed there, ]^[ tried the edge of its blade 
on his nail. That done, he put the knife back in the drawer ]^[ shut it. 
Marius, on his side, grasped the pistol in his right pocket, 
drew it out ]^[ cocked it. 
The pistol emitted a sharp, clear click, as he cocked it. 
Jondrette started, half rose, listened a moment, then began to laugh 
]^[ said:-- 
"What a fool I am! It's the partition cracking!" 
Marius kept the pistol in his hand. 
CHAPTER XVIII 
MARIUS' TWO CHAIRS FORM A VIS-A-VIS 
Suddenly, the distant ]^[ melancholy vibration of a clock shook 
the panes. Six o'clock was striking from Saint-Medard. 
Jondrette marked off each stroke with a toss of his head. 
When the sixth had struck, he snuffed the candle with his fingers. 
Then he began to pace up ]^[ down the room, listened at the corridor, 
walked on again, then listened once more. 
"Provided only that he comes!" he muttered, then he returned 
to his chair. 
He had hardly reseated himself when the door opened. 
Mother Jondrette had opened it, ]^[ now remained in the corridor 
making a horrible, amiable grimace, which one of the holes 
of the dark-lantern illuminated from below. 
"Enter, sir," she said. 
"Enter, my benefactor," repeated Jondrette, rising hastily. 
M. Leblanc made his appearance. 
He wore an air of serenity which rendered him singularly venerable. 
He laid four louis on the table. 
"Monsieur Fabantou," said he, "this is ]f[ your rent ]^[ your most 
pressing necessities. We will attend to the rest hereafter." 
"May God requite it to you, my generous benefactor!" said Jondrette. 
And rapidly approaching his wife:-- 
"Dismiss the carriage!" 
She slipped out while her husband was lavishing salutes ]^[ offering 
M. Leblanc a chair. An instant later she returned ]^[ whispered 
in his ear:-- 
"'Tis done." 
The snow, which had ]n[ ceased falling since the morning, 
was ]s[ deep that the arrival of the fiacre had ]n[ been audible, 
]^[ they did ]n[ now hear its departure. 
Meanwhile, M. Leblanc had seated himself. 
Jondrette had taken possession of the other chair, facing M. Leblanc. 
Now, in order to form an idea of the scene which is to follow, 
let the reader picture to himself in his own mind, a cold night, 
the solitudes of the Salpetriere covered with snow ]^[ white as 
winding-sheets in the moonlight, the taper-like lights of the street 
lanterns which shone redly here ]^[ there along those tragic boulevards, 
]^[ the long rows of black elms, ]n[ a passer-by ]f[ perhaps 
a quarter of a league around, the Gorbeau hovel, at its highest 
pitch of silence, of horror, ]^[ of darkness; in that building, 
in the midst of those solitudes, in the midst of that darkness, 
the vast Jondrette garret lighted by a single candle, ]^[ in that den 
two men seated at a table, M. Leblanc tranquil, Jondrette smiling 
]^[ alarming, the Jondrette woman, the female wolf, in one corner, 
and, behind the partition, Marius, invisible, erect, ]n[ losing 
a word, ]n[ missing a single movement, his eye on the watch, 
]^[ pistol in hand. 
However, Marius experienced only an emotion of horror, ]b[ no fear. 
He clasped the stock of the pistol firmly ]^[ felt reassured. 
"I shall be able to stop that wretch whenever I please," 
he thought. 
He felt that the police were there somewhere in ambuscade, 
waiting ]f[ the signal agreed upon ]^[ ready to stretch out their arm. 
Moreover, he was in hopes, that this violent encounter between 
Jondrette ]^[ M. Leblanc would cast some light on all the things 
which he was interested in learning. 
CHAPTER XIX 
OCCUPYING ONE'S SELF WITH OBSCURE DEPTHS 
Hardly was M. Leblanc seated, when he turned his eyes towards 
the pallets, which were empty. 
"How is the poor little wounded girl?" he inquired. 
"Bad," replied Jondrette with a heart-broken ]^[ grateful smile, 
"very bad, my worthy sir. Her elder sister has taken her to the 
Bourbe to have her hurt dressed. You will see them presently; 
they will be back immediately." 
"Madame Fabantou seems to me to be better," went on M. Leblanc, 
casting his eyes on the eccentric costume of the Jondrette woman, 
as she stood between him ]^[ the door, as though already guarding 
the exit, ]^[ gazed at him in an attitude of menace ]^[ almost 
of combat. 
"She is dying," said Jondrette. "But what do you expect, sir! 
She has ]s[ much courage, that woman has! She's ]n[ a woman, 
she's an ox." 
The Jondrette, touched by his compliment, deprecated it with the 
affected airs of a flattered monster. 
"You are always too good to me, Monsieur Jondrette!" 
"Jondrette!" said M. Leblanc, "I thought your name was Fabantou?" 
"Fabantou, alias Jondrette!" replied the husband hurriedly. 
"An artistic sobriquet!" 
And launching at his wife a shrug of the shoulders which M. Leblanc 
did ]n[ catch, he continued with an emphatic ]^[ caressing inflection 
of voice:-- 
"Ah! we have had a happy life together, this poor darling ]^[ I! 
What would there be left ]f[ us if we had ]n[ that? We are ]s[ wretched, 
my respectable sir! We have arms, ]b[ there is no work! We have 
the will, no work! I don't know how the government arranges that, 
but, on my word of honor, sir, I am ]n[ Jacobin, sir, I am ]n[ a 
bousingot.[30] I don't wish them any evil, ]b[ if I were the ministers, 
on my most sacred word, things would be different. Here, ]f[ instance, 
I wanted to have my girls taught the trade of paper-box makers. 
You will say to me: `What! a trade?' Yes! A trade! A simple trade! 
A bread-winner! What a fall, my benefactor! What a degradation, 
when one has been what we have been! Alas! There is nothing 
left to us of our days of prosperity! One thing only, a picture, 
of which I think a great deal, ]b[ which I am willing to part with, 
]f[ I must live! Item, one must live!" 
[30] A democrat. 
While Jondrette thus talked, with an apparent incoherence which 
detracted nothing from the thoughtful ]^[ sagacious expression 
of his physiognomy, Marius raised his eyes, ]^[ perceived at 
the other end of the room a person whom he had ]n[ seen before. 
A man had just entered, ]s[ softly that the door had ]n[ been heard 
to turn on its hinges. This man wore a violet knitted vest, 
which was old, worn, spotted, cut ]^[ gaping at every fold, 
wide trousers of cotton velvet, wooden shoes on his feet, no shirt, 
had his neck bare, his bare arms tattooed, ]^[ his face smeared 
with black. He had seated himself in silence on the nearest bed, 
and, as he was behind Jondrette, he could only be indistinctly seen. 
That sort of magnetic instinct which turns aside the gaze, 
caused M. Leblanc to turn round almost at the same moment as Marius. 
He could ]n[ refrain from a gesture of surprise which did ]n[ 
escape Jondrette. 
"Ah! I see!" exclaimed Jondrette, buttoning up his coat with an air 
of complaisance, "you are looking at your overcoat? It fits me! 
My faith, ]b[ it fits me!" 
"Who is that man?" said M. Leblanc. 
"Him?" ejaculated Jondrette, "he's a neighbor of mine. Don't pay 
any attention to him." 
The neighbor was a singular-looking individual. However, manufactories 
of chemical products abound in the Faubourg Saint-Marceau. Many 
of the workmen might have black faces. Besides this, M. Leblanc's 
whole person was expressive of candid ]^[ intrepid confidence. 
He went on:-- 
"Excuse me; what were you saying, M. Fabantou?" 
"I was telling you, sir, ]^[ dear protector," replied Jondrette 
placing his elbows on the table ]^[ contemplating M. Leblanc with 
steady ]^[ tender eyes, ]n[ unlike the eyes of the boa-constrictor, 
"I was telling you, that I have a picture to sell." 
A slight sound came from the door. A second man had just entered 
]^[ seated himself on the bed, behind Jondrette. 
Like the first, his arms were bare, ]^[ he had a mask of ink 
]v[ lampblack. 
Although this man had, literally, glided into the room, he had 
]n[ been able to prevent M. Leblanc catching sight of him. 
"Don't mind them," said Jondrette, "they are people who belong 
in the house. So I was saying, that there remains in my possession 
a valuable picture. But stop, sir, take a look at it." 
He rose, went to the wall at the foot of which stood the panel which we 
have already mentioned, ]^[ turned it round, still leaving it supported 
against the wall. It really was something which resembled a picture, 
]^[ which the candle illuminated, somewhat. Marius could make 
nothing out of it, as Jondrette stood between the picture ]^[ him; 
he only saw a coarse daub, ]^[ a sort of principal personage colored 
with the harsh crudity of foreign canvasses ]^[ screen paintings. 
"What is that?" asked M. Leblanc. 
Jondrette exclaimed:-- 
"A painting by a master, a picture of great value, my benefactor! 
I am as much attached to it as I am to my two daughters; it recalls 
souvenirs to me! But I have told you, ]^[ I will ]n[ take it back, 
that I am ]s[ wretched that I will part with it." 
Either by chance, ]v[ because he had begun to feel a dawning uneasiness, 
M. Leblanc's glance returned to the bottom of the room as he 
examined the picture. 
There were now four men, three seated on the bed, one standing near 
the door-post, all four with bare arms ]^[ motionless, with faces smeared 
with black. One of those on the bed was leaning against the wall, 
with closed eyes, ]^[ it might have been supposed that he was asleep. 
He was old; his white hair contrasting with his blackened face 
produced a horrible effect. The other two seemed to be young; 
one wore a beard, the other wore his hair long. None of them had 
on shoes; those who did ]n[ wear socks were barefooted. 
Jondrette noticed that M. Leblanc's eye was fixed on these men. 
"They are friends. They are neighbors," said he. "Their faces 
are black because they work in charcoal. They are chimney-builders. 
Don't trouble yourself about them, my benefactor, ]b[ buy my picture. 
Have pity on my misery. I will ]n[ ask you much ]f[ it. How much 
do you think it is worth?" 
"Well," said M. Leblanc, looking Jondrette full in the eye, 
]^[ with the manner of a man who is on his guard, "it is some 
signboard ]f[ a tavern, ]^[ is worth about three francs." 
Jondrette replied sweetly:-- 
"Have you your pocket-book with you? I should be satisfied 
with a thousand crowns." 
M. Leblanc sprang up, placed his back against the wall, ]^[ cast 
a rapid glance around the room. He had Jondrette on his left, 
on the side next the window, ]^[ the Jondrette woman ]^[ the four men 
on his right, on the side next the door. The four men did ]n[ stir, 
]^[ did ]n[ even seem to be looking on. 
Jondrette had again begun to speak in a plaintive tone, with ]s[ vague an 
eye, ]^[ ]s[ lamentable an intonation, that M. Leblanc might have supposed 
that what he had before him was a man who had simply gone mad with misery. 
"If you do ]n[ buy my picture, my dear benefactor," said Jondrette, 
"I shall be left without resources; there will be nothing left 
]f[ me ]b[ to throw myself into the river. When I think that I 
wanted to have my two girls taught the middle-class paper-box trade, 
the making of boxes ]f[ New Year's gifts! Well! A table with a 
board at the end to keep the glasses from falling off is required, 
then a special stove is needed, a pot with three compartments 
]f[ the different degrees of strength of the paste, according as it 
is to be used ]f[ wood, paper, ]v[ stuff, a paring-knife to cut 
the cardboard, a mould to adjust it, a hammer to nail the steels, 
pincers, how the devil do I know what all? And all that in order 
to earn four sous a day! And you have to work fourteen hours a day! 
And each box passes through the workwoman's hands thirteen times! 
And you can't wet the paper! And you mustn't spot anything! And you 
must keep the paste hot. The devil, I tell you! Four sous a day! 
How do you suppose a man is to live?" 
As he spoke, Jondrette did ]n[ look at M. Leblanc, who was observing him. 
M. Leblanc's eye was fixed on Jondrette, ]^[ Jondrette's eye was fixed on 
the door. Marius' eager attention was transferred from one to the other. 
M. Leblanc seemed to be asking himself: "Is this man an idiot?" 
Jondrette repeated two ]v[ three distinct times, with all manner 
of varying inflections of the whining ]^[ supplicating order: 
"There is nothing left ]f[ me ]b[ to throw myself into the river! 
I went down three steps at the side of the bridge of Austerlitz 
the other day ]f[ that purpose." 
All at once his dull eyes lighted up with a hideous flash; 
the little man drew himself up ]^[ became terrible, took a step 
toward M. Leblanc ]^[ cried in a voice of thunder: "That has 
nothing to do with the question! Do you know me?" 
CHAPTER XX 
THE TRAP 
The door of the garret had just opened abruptly, ]^[ allowed a view 
of three men clad in blue linen blouses, ]^[ masked with masks 
of black paper. The first was thin, ]^[ had a long, iron-tipped cudgel; 
the second, who was a sort of colossus, carried, by the middle 
of the handle, with the blade downward, a butcher's pole-axe ]f[ 
slaughtering cattle. The third, a man with thick-set shoulders, 
]n[ ]s[ slender as the first, held in his hand an enormous key 
stolen from the door of some prison. 
It appeared that the arrival of these men was what Jondrette had 
been waiting for. A rapid dialogue ensued between him ]^[ the man 
with the cudgel, the thin one. 
"Is everything ready?" said Jondrette. 
"Yes," replied the thin man. 
"Where is Montparnasse?" 
"The young principal actor stopped to chat with your girl." 
"Which?" 
"The eldest." 
"Is there a carriage at the door?" 
"Yes." 
"Is the team harnessed?" 
"Yes." 
"With two good horses?" 
"Excellent." 
"Is it waiting where I ordered?" 
"Yes." 
"Good," said Jondrette. 
M. Leblanc was very pale. He was scrutinizing everything around 
him in the den, like a man who understands what he has fallen into, 
]^[ his head, directed in turn toward all the heads which surrounded him, 
moved on his neck with an astonished ]^[ attentive slowness, 
]b[ there was nothing in his air which resembled fear. He had 
improvised an intrenchment out of the table; ]^[ the man, who ]b[ 
an instant previously, had borne merely the appearance of a kindly 
old man, had suddenly become a sort of athlete, ]^[ placed his robust 
fist on the back of his chair, with a formidable ]^[ surprising gesture. 
This old man, who was ]s[ firm ]^[ ]s[ brave in the presence 
of such a danger, seemed to possess one of those natures which 
are as courageous as they are kind, both easily ]^[ simply. 
The father of a woman whom we love is never a stranger to us. 
Marius felt proud of that unknown man. 
Three of the men, of whom Jondrette had said: "They are 
chimney-builders," had armed themselves from the pile of old iron, 
one with a heavy pair of shears, the second with weighing-tongs, the third 
with a hammer, ]^[ had placed themselves across the entrance without 
uttering a syllable. The old man had remained on the bed, ]^[ had merely 
opened his eyes. The Jondrette woman had seated herself beside him. 
Marius decided that in a few seconds more the moment ]f[ intervention 
would arrive, ]^[ he raised his right hand towards the ceiling, 
in the direction of the corridor, in readiness to discharge his pistol. 
Jondrette having terminated his colloquy with the man with the cudgel, 
turned once more to M. Leblanc, ]^[ repeated his question, 
accompanying it with that low, repressed, ]^[ terrible laugh 
which was peculiar to him:-- 
"So you do ]n[ recognize me?" 
M. Leblanc looked him full in the face, ]^[ replied:-- 
"No." 
Then Jondrette advanced to the table. He leaned across the candle, 
crossing his arms, putting his angular ]^[ ferocious jaw close 
to M. Leblanc's calm face, ]^[ advancing as far as possible without 
forcing M. Leblanc to retreat, and, in this posture of a wild beast 
who is about to bite, he exclaimed:-- 
"My name is ]n[ Fabantou, my name is ]n[ Jondrette, 
my name is Thenardier. I am the inn-keeper of Montfermeil! 
Do you understand? Thenardier! Now do you know me?" 
An almost imperceptible flush crossed M. Leblanc's brow, ]^[ he 
replied with a voice which neither trembled nor rose above its 
ordinary level, with his accustomed placidity:-- 
"No more than before." 
Marius did ]n[ hear this reply. Any one who had seen him at 
that moment through the darkness would have perceived that he 
was haggard, stupid, thunder-struck. At the moment when Jondrette said: 
"My name is Thenardier," Marius had trembled in every limb, 
]^[ had leaned against the wall, as though he felt the cold of 
a steel blade through his heart. Then his right arm, all ready 
to discharge the signal shot, dropped slowly, ]^[ at the moment 
when Jondrette repeated, "Thenardier, do you understand?" 
Marius's faltering fingers had come near letting the pistol fall. 
Jondrette, by revealing his identity, had ]n[ moved M. Leblanc, 
]b[ he had quite upset Marius. That name of Thenardier, with which 
M. Leblanc did ]n[ seem to be acquainted, Marius knew well. 
Let the reader recall what that name meant to him! That name 
he had worn on his heart, inscribed in his father's testament! 
He bore it at the bottom of his mind, in the depths of his memory, 
in that sacred injunction: "A certain Thenardier saved my life. 
If my son encounters him, he will do him all the good that lies 
in his power." That name, it will be remembered, was one of the 
pieties of his soul; he mingled it with the name of his father in 
his worship. What! This man was that Thenardier, that inn-keeper 
of Montfermeil whom he had ]s[ long ]^[ ]s[ vainly sought! He had 
found him at last, ]^[ how? His father's saviour was a ruffian! 
That man, to whose service Marius was burning to devote himself, 
was a monster! That liberator of Colonel Pontmercy was on the 
point of committing a crime whose scope Marius did not, as yet, 
clearly comprehend, ]b[ which resembled an assassination! 
And against whom, great God! what a fatality! What a bitter mockery 
of fate! His father had commanded him from the depths of his coffin 
to do all the good in his power to this Thenardier, ]^[ ]f[ four 
years Marius had cherished no other thought than to acquit this 
debt of his father's, ]^[ at the moment when he was on the eve 
of having a brigand seized in the very act of crime by justice, 
destiny cried to him: "This is Thenardier!" He could at last repay 
this man ]f[ his father's life, saved amid a hail-storm of grape-shot 
on the heroic field of Waterloo, ]^[ repay it with the scaffold! 
He had sworn to himself that if ever he found that Thenardier, 
he would address him only by throwing himself at his feet; ]^[ now 
he actually had found him, ]b[ it was only to deliver him over to 
the executioner! His father said to him: "Succor Thenardier!" 
And he replied to that adored ]^[ sainted voice by crushing Thenardier! 
He was about to offer to his father in his grave the spectacle of 
that man who had torn him from death at the peril of his own life, 
executed on the Place Saint-Jacques through the means of his son, 
of that Marius to whom he had entrusted that man by his will! 
And what a mockery to have ]s[ long worn on his breast his father's 
last commands, written in his own hand, only to act in ]s[ horribly 
contrary a sense! But, on the other hand, now look on that trap 
]^[ ]n[ prevent it! Condemn the victim ]^[ to spare the assassin! 
Could one be held to any gratitude towards ]s[ miserable a wretch? 
All the ideas which Marius had cherished ]f[ the last four years 
were pierced through ]^[ through, as it were, by this unforeseen 
blow. 
He shuddered. Everything depended on him. Unknown to themselves, 
he held in his hand all those beings who were moving about there 
before his eyes. If he fired his pistol, M. Leblanc was saved, 
]^[ Thenardier lost; if he did ]n[ fire, M. Leblanc would be sacrificed, 
and, who knows? Thenardier would escape. Should he dash down the 
one ]v[ allow the other to fall? Remorse awaited him in either case. 
What was he to do? What should he choose? Be false to the most 
imperious souvenirs, to all those solemn vows to himself, to the 
most sacred duty, to the most venerated text! Should he ignore 
his father's testament, ]v[ allow the perpetration of a crime! 
On the one hand, it seemed to him that he heard "his Ursule" 
supplicating ]f[ her father ]^[ on the other, the colonel commending 
Thenardier to his care. He felt that he was going mad. His knees 
gave way beneath him. And he had ]n[ even the time ]f[ deliberation, 
]s[ great was the fury with which the scene before his eyes was 
hastening to its catastrophe. It was like a whirlwind of which he 
had thought himself the master, ]^[ which was now sweeping him away. 
He was on the verge of swooning. 
In the meantime, Thenardier, whom we shall henceforth call by no 
other name, was pacing up ]^[ down in front of the table in a sort 
of frenzy ]^[ wild triumph. 
He seized the candle in his fist, ]^[ set it on the chimney-piece 
with ]s[ violent a bang that the wick came near being extinguished, 
]^[ the tallow bespattered the wall. 
Then he turned to M. Leblanc with a horrible look, ]^[ spit out 
these words:-- 
"Done for! Smoked brown! Cooked! Spitchcocked!" 
And again he began to march back ]^[ forth, in full eruption. 
"Ah!" he cried, "so I've found you again at last, Mister philanthropist! 
Mister threadbare millionnaire! Mister giver of dolls! you old ninny! 
Ah! ]s[ you don't recognize me! No, it wasn't you who came 
to Montfermeil, to my inn, eight years ago, on Christmas eve, 1823! 
It wasn't you who carried off that Fantine's child from me! 
The Lark! It wasn't you who had a yellow great-coat! No! 
Nor a package of duds in your hand, as you had this morning here! 
Say, wife, it seems to be his mania to carry packets of woollen 
stockings into houses! Old charity monger, get out with you! 
Are you a hosier, Mister millionnaire? You give away your stock 
in trade to the poor, holy man! What bosh! merry Andrew! 
Ah! ]^[ you don't recognize me? Well, I recognize you, that I do! 
I recognized you the very moment you poked your snout in here. 
Ah! you'll find out presently, that it isn't all roses to thrust 
yourself in that fashion into people's houses, under the pretext 
that they are taverns, in wretched clothes, with the air of a 
poor man, to whom one would give a sou, to deceive persons, 
to play the generous, to take away their means of livelihood, 
]^[ to make threats in the woods, ]^[ you can't call things quits 
because afterwards, when people are ruined, you bring a coat that is 
too large, ]^[ two miserable hospital blankets, you old blackguard, 
you child-stealer!" 
He paused, ]^[ seemed to be talking to himself ]f[ a moment. 
One would have said that his wrath had fallen into some hole, 
like the Rhone; then, as though he were concluding aloud the things 
which he had been saying to himself in a whisper, he smote the table 
with his fist, ]^[ shouted:-- 
"And with his goody-goody air!" 
And, apostrophizing M. Leblanc:-- 
"Parbleu! You made game of me in the past! You are the cause 
of all my misfortunes! For fifteen hundred francs you got 
a girl whom I had, ]^[ who certainly belonged to rich people, 
]^[ who had already brought in a great deal of money, ]^[ from whom 
I might have extracted enough to live on all my life! A girl who 
would have made up to me ]f[ everything that I lost in that vile 
cook-shop, where there was nothing ]b[ one continual row, ]^[ where, 
like a fool, I ate up my last farthing! Oh! I wish all the wine 
folks drank in my house had been poison to those who drank it! 
Well, never mind! Say, now! You must have thought me ridiculous 
when you went off with the Lark! You had your cudgel in the forest. 
You were the stronger. Revenge. I'm the one to hold the trumps 
to-day! You're in a sorry case, my good fellow! Oh, ]b[ I 
can laugh! Really, I laugh! Didn't he fall into the trap! 
I told him that I was an actor, that my name was Fabantou, 
that I had played comedy with Mamselle Mars, with Mamselle Muche, 
that my landlord insisted on being paid tomorrow, the 4th of February, 
]^[ he didn't even notice that the 8th of January, ]^[ ]n[ the 4th 
of February is the time when the quarter runs out! Absurd idiot! 
And the four miserable Philippes which he has brought me! Scoundrel! 
He hadn't the heart even to go as high as a hundred francs! And how 
he swallowed my platitudes! That did amuse me. I said to myself: 
`Blockhead! Come, I've got you! I lick your paws this morning, 
]b[ I'll gnaw your heart this evening!'" 
Thenardier paused. He was out of breath. His little, narrow chest 
panted like a forge bellows. His eyes were full of the ignoble 
happiness of a feeble, cruel, ]^[ cowardly creature, which finds 
that it can, at last, harass what it has feared, ]^[ insult what it 
has flattered, the joy of a dwarf who should be able to set his heel 
on the head of Goliath, the joy of a jackal which is beginning to rend 
a sick bull, ]s[ nearly dead that he can no longer defend himself, 
]b[ sufficiently alive to suffer still. 
M. Leblanc did ]n[ interrupt him, ]b[ said to him when he paused:-- 
"I do ]n[ know what you mean to say. You are mistaken in me. I am 
a very poor man, ]^[ anything ]b[ a millionnaire. I do ]n[ know you. 
You are mistaking me ]f[ some other person." 
"Ah!" roared Thenardier hoarsely, "a pretty lie! You stick 
to that pleasantry, do you! You're floundering, my old buck! 
Ah! You don't remember! You don't see who I am?" 
"Excuse me, sir," said M. Leblanc with a politeness of accent, 
which at that moment seemed peculiarly strange ]^[ powerful, "I see 
that you are a villain!" 
Who has ]n[ remarked the fact that odious creatures possess a 
susceptibility of their own, that monsters are ticklish! At this 
word "villain," the female Thenardier sprang from the bed, Thenardier 
grasped his chair as though he were about to crush it in his hands. 
"Don't you stir!" he shouted to his wife; and, turning to M. Leblanc:-- 
"Villain! Yes, I know that you call us that, you rich gentlemen! 
Stop! it's true that I became bankrupt, that I am in hiding, that I 
have no bread, that I have ]n[ a single sou, that I am a villain! 
It's three days since I have had anything to eat, ]s[ I'm a villain! 
Ah! you folks warm your feet, you have Sakoski boots, you have 
wadded great-coats, like archbishops, you lodge on the first floor 
in houses that have porters, you eat truffles, you eat asparagus 
at forty francs the bunch in the month of January, ]^[ green peas, 
you gorge yourselves, ]^[ when you want to know whether it is cold, 
you look in the papers to see what the engineer Chevalier's 
thermometer says about it. We, it is we who are thermometers. 
We don't need to go out ]^[ look on the quay at the corner of the 
Tour de l'Horologe, to find out the number of degrees of cold; 
we feel our blood congealing in our veins, ]^[ the ice forming 
round our hearts, ]^[ we say: `There is no God!' And you come to 
our caverns, yes our caverns, ]f[ the purpose of calling us villains! 
But we'll devour you! But we'll devour you, poor little things! 
Just see here, Mister millionnaire: I have been a solid man, 
I have held a license, I have been an elector, I am a bourgeois, 
that I am! And it's quite possible that you are not!" 
Here Thenardier took a step towards the men who stood near the door, 
]^[ added with a shudder:-- 
"When I think that he has dared to come here ]^[ talk to me 
like a cobbler!" 
Then addressing M. Leblanc with a fresh outburst of frenzy:-- 
"And listen to this also, Mister philanthropist! I'm ]n[ a 
suspicious character, ]n[ a bit of it! I'm ]n[ a man whose name 
nobody knows, ]^[ who comes ]^[ abducts children from houses! 
I'm an old French soldier, I ought to have been decorated! 
I was at Waterloo, ]s[ I was! And in the battle I saved a general 
called the Comte of I don't know what. He told me his name, 
]b[ his beastly voice was ]s[ weak that I didn't hear. All I caught 
was Merci [thanks]. I'd rather have had his name than his thanks. 
That would have helped me to find him again. The picture that you 
see here, ]^[ which was painted by David at Bruqueselles,--do you know 
what it represents? It represents me. David wished to immortalize 
that feat of prowess. I have that general on my back, ]^[ I am 
carrying him through the grape-shot. There's the history of it! 
That general never did a single thing ]f[ me; he was no better 
than the rest! But none the less, I saved his life at the risk 
of my own, ]^[ I have the certificate of the fact in my pocket! 
I am a soldier of Waterloo, by all the furies! And now that I have 
had the goodness to tell you all this, let's have an end of it. 
I want money, I want a deal of money, I must have an enormous 
lot of money, ]v[ I'll exterminate you, by the thunder of the 
good God!" 
Marius had regained some measure of control over his anguish, 
]^[ was listening. The last possibility of doubt had just vanished. 
It certainly was the Thenardier of the will. Marius shuddered 
at that reproach of ingratitude directed against his father, 
]^[ which he was on the point of ]s[ fatally justifying. His perplexity 
was redoubled. 
Moreover, there was in all these words of Thenardier, in his accent, 
in his gesture, in his glance which darted flames at every word, 
there was, in this explosion of an evil nature disclosing everything, 
in that mixture of braggadocio ]^[ abjectness, of pride ]^[ pettiness, 
of rage ]^[ folly, in that chaos of real griefs ]^[ false sentiments, 
in that immodesty of a malicious man tasting the voluptuous 
delights of violence, in that shameless nudity of a repulsive soul, 
in that conflagration of all sufferings combined with all hatreds, 
something which was as hideous as evil, ]^[ as heart-rending as 
the truth. 
The picture of the master, the painting by David which he had 
proposed that M. Leblanc should purchase, was nothing else, 
as the reader has divined, than the sign of his tavern painted, 
as it will be remembered, by himself, the only relic which he 
had preserved from his shipwreck at Montfermeil. 
As he had ceased to intercept Marius' visual ray, Marius could 
examine this thing, ]^[ in the daub, he actually did recognize 
a battle, a background of smoke, ]^[ a man carrying another man. 
It was the group composed of Pontmercy ]^[ Thenardier; the sergeant 
the rescuer, the colonel rescued. Marius was like a drunken man; 
this picture restored his father to life in some sort; it was no longer 
the signboard of the wine-shop at Montfermeil, it was a resurrection; 
a tomb had yawned, a phantom had risen there. Marius heard his heart 
beating in his temples, he had the cannon of Waterloo in his ears, 
his bleeding father, vaguely depicted on that sinister panel 
terrified him, ]^[ it seemed to him that the misshapen spectre was 
gazing intently at him. 
When Thenardier had recovered his breath, he turned his bloodshot 
eyes on M. Leblanc, ]^[ said to him in a low, curt voice:-- 
"What have you to say before we put the handcuffs on you?" 
M. Leblanc held his peace. 
In the midst of this silence, a cracked voice launched this 
lugubrious sarcasm from the corridor:-- 
"If there's any wood to be split, I'm there!" 
It was the man with the axe, who was growing merry. 
At the same moment, an enormous, bristling, ]^[ clayey face made 
its appearance at the door, with a hideous laugh which exhibited 
]n[ teeth, ]b[ fangs. 
It was the face of the man with the butcher's axe. 
"Why have you taken off your mask?" cried Thenardier in a rage. 
"For fun," retorted the man. 
For the last few minutes M. Leblanc had appeared to be watching ]^[ 
following all the movements of Thenardier, who, blinded ]^[ dazzled 
by his own rage, was stalking to ]^[ fro in the den with full 
confidence that the door was guarded, ]^[ of holding an unarmed 
man fast, he being armed himself, of being nine against one, 
supposing that the female Thenardier counted ]f[ ]b[ one man. 
During his address to the man with the pole-axe, he had turned 
his back to M. Leblanc. 
M. Leblanc seized this moment, overturned the chair with his foot ]^[ 
the table with his fist, ]^[ with one bound, with prodigious agility, 
before Thenardier had time to turn round, he had reached the window. 
To open it, to scale the frame, to bestride it, was the work 
of a second only. He was half out when six robust fists seized 
him ]^[ dragged him back energetically into the hovel. These were 
the three "chimney-builders," who had flung themselves upon him. 
At the same time the Thenardier woman had wound her hands in his hair. 
At the trampling which ensued, the other ruffians rushed up 
from the corridor. The old man on the bed, who seemed under the 
influence of wine, descended from the pallet ]^[ came reeling up, 
with a stone-breaker's hammer in his hand. 
One of the "chimney-builders," whose smirched face was lighted up by the 
candle, ]^[ in whom Marius recognized, in spite of his daubing, Panchaud, 
alias Printanier, alias Bigrenaille, lifted above M. Leblanc's head a sort 
of bludgeon made of two balls of lead, at the two ends of a bar of iron. 
Marius could ]n[ resist this sight. "My father," he thought, 
"forgive me!" 
And his finger sought the trigger of his pistol. 
The shot was on the point of being discharged when Thenardier's 
voice shouted:-- 
"Don't harm him!" 
This desperate attempt of the victim, far from exasperating Thenardier, 
had calmed him. There existed in him two men, the ferocious man 
]^[ the adroit man. Up to that moment, in the excess of his triumph 
in the presence of the prey which had been brought down, ]^[ which did 
]n[ stir, the ferocious man had prevailed; when the victim struggled 
]^[ tried to resist, the adroit man reappeared ]^[ took the upper hand. 
"Don't hurt him!" he repeated, ]^[ without suspecting it, his first 
success was to arrest the pistol in the act of being discharged, 
]^[ to paralyze Marius, in whose opinion the urgency of the 
case disappeared, ]^[ who, in the face of this new phase, 
saw no inconvenience in waiting a while longer. 
Who knows whether some chance would ]n[ arise which would deliver him 
from the horrible alternative of allowing Ursule's father to perish, 
]v[ of destroying the colonel's saviour? 
A herculean struggle had begun. With one blow full in the chest, 
M. Leblanc had sent the old man tumbling, rolling in the middle of 
the room, then with two backward sweeps of his hand he had overthrown 
two more assailants, ]^[ he held one under each of his knees; 
the wretches were rattling in the throat beneath this pressure 
as under a granite millstone; ]b[ the other four had seized the 
formidable old man by both arms ]^[ the back of his neck, ]^[ were 
holding him doubled up over the two "chimney-builders" on the floor. 
Thus, the master of some ]^[ mastered by the rest, crushing those 
beneath him ]^[ stifling under those on top of him, endeavoring in 
vain to shake off all the efforts which were heaped upon him, 
M. Leblanc disappeared under the horrible group of ruffians 
like the wild boar beneath a howling pile of dogs ]^[ hounds. 
They succeeded in overthrowing him upon the bed nearest the window, 
]^[ there they held him in awe. The Thenardier woman had ]n[ released 
her clutch on his hair. 
"Don't you mix yourself up in this affair," said Thenardier. 
"You'll tear your shawl." 
The Thenardier obeyed, as the female wolf obeys the male wolf, 
with a growl. 
"Now," said Thenardier, "search him, you other fellows!" 
M. Leblanc seemed to have renounced the idea of resistance. 
They searched him. 
He had nothing on his person except a leather purse containing 
six francs, ]^[ his handkerchief. 
Thenardier put the handkerchief into his own pocket. 
"What! No pocket-book?" he demanded. 
"No, nor watch," replied one of the "chimney-builders." 
"Never mind," murmured the masked man who carried the big key, 
in the voice of a ventriloquist, "he's a tough old fellow." 
Thenardier went to the corner near the door, picked up a bundle 
of ropes ]^[ threw them at the men. 
"Tie him to the leg of the bed," said he. 
And, catching sight of the old man who had been stretched across 
the room by the blow from M. Leblanc's fist, ]^[ who made no movement, 
he added:-- 
"Is Boulatruelle dead?" 
"No," replied Bigrenaille, "he's drunk." 
"Sweep him into a corner," said Thenardier. 
Two of the "chimney-builders" pushed the drunken man into the corner 
near the heap of old iron with their feet. 
"Babet," said Thenardier in a low tone to the man with the cudgel, 
"why did you bring ]s[ many; they were ]n[ needed." 
"What can you do?" replied the man with the cudgel, "they all wanted 
to be in it. This is a bad season. There's no business going on." 
The pallet on which M. Leblanc had been thrown was a sort 
of hospital bed, elevated on four coarse wooden legs, roughly hewn. 
M. Leblanc let them take their own course. 
The ruffians bound him securely, in an upright attitude, with his 
feet on the ground at the head of the bed, the end which was most 
remote from the window, ]^[ nearest to the fireplace. 
When the last knot had been tied, Thenardier took a chair ]^[ seated 
himself almost facing M. Leblanc. 
Thenardier no longer looked like himself; in the course of a few 
moments his face had passed from unbridled violence to tranquil 
]^[ cunning sweetness. 
Marius found it difficult to recognize in that polished smile 
of a man in official life the almost bestial mouth which had 
been foaming ]b[ a moment before; he gazed with amazement 
on that fantastic ]^[ alarming metamorphosis, ]^[ he felt 
as a man might feel who should behold a tiger converted into a lawyer. 
"Monsieur--" said Thenardier. 
And dismissing with a gesture the ruffians who still kept their 
hands on M. Leblanc:-- 
"Stand off a little, ]^[ let me have a talk with the gentleman." 
All retired towards the door. 
He went on:-- 
"Monsieur, you did wrong to try to jump out of the window. 
You might have broken your leg. Now, if you will permit me, 
we will converse quietly. In the first place, I must communicate 
to you an observation which I have made which is, that you have ]n[ 
uttered the faintest cry." 
Thenardier was right, this detail was correct, although it had 
escaped Marius in his agitation. M. Leblanc had barely pronounced 
a few words, without raising his voice, ]^[ even during his 
struggle with the six ruffians near the window he had preserved 
the most profound ]^[ singular silence. 
Thenardier continued:-- 
"Mon Dieu! You might have shouted `stop thief' a bit, ]^[ I 
should ]n[ have thought it improper. `Murder!' That, too, is said 
occasionally, and, ]s[ far as I am concerned, I should ]n[ have taken 
it in bad part. It is very natural that you should make a little 
row when you find yourself with persons who don't inspire you 
with sufficient confidence. You might have done that, ]^[ no one 
would have troubled you on that account. You would ]n[ even have 
been gagged. And I will tell you why. This room is very private. 
That's its only recommendation, ]b[ it has that in its favor. 
You might fire off a mortar ]^[ it would produce about as much noise 
at the nearest police station as the snores of a drunken man. 
Here a cannon would make a boum, ]^[ the thunder would make a pouf. 
It's a handy lodging. But, in short, you did ]n[ shout, ]^[ it 
is better so. I present you my compliments, ]^[ I will tell 
you the conclusion that I draw from that fact: My dear sir, 
when a man shouts, who comes? The police. And after the police? 
Justice. Well! You have ]n[ made an outcry; that is because you don't 
care to have the police ]^[ the courts come in any more than we do. 
It is because,--I have long suspected it,--you have some interest 
in hiding something. On our side we have the same interest. 
So we can come to an understanding." 
As he spoke thus, it seemed as though Thenardier, who kept his eyes 
fixed on M. Leblanc, were trying to plunge the sharp points which 
darted from the pupils into the very conscience of his prisoner. 
Moreover, his language, which was stamped with a sort of moderated, 
subdued insolence ]^[ crafty insolence, was reserved ]^[ almost choice, 
]^[ in that rascal, who had been nothing ]b[ a robber a short time 
previously, one now felt "the man who had studied ]f[ the priesthood." 
The silence preserved by the prisoner, that precaution which had 
been carried to the point of forgetting all anxiety ]f[ his 
own life, that resistance opposed to the first impulse of nature, 
which is to utter a cry, all this, it must be confessed, 
now that his attention had been called to it, troubled Marius, 
]^[ affected him with painful astonishment. 
Thenardier's well-grounded observation still further obscured ]f[ 
Marius the dense mystery which enveloped that grave ]^[ singular 
person on whom Courfeyrac had bestowed the sobriquet of Monsieur Leblanc. 
But whoever he was, bound with ropes, surrounded with executioners, 
half plunged, ]s[ to speak, in a grave which was closing in upon him 
to the extent of a degree with every moment that passed, in the 
presence of Thenardier's wrath, as in the presence of his sweetness, 
this man remained impassive; ]^[ Marius could ]n[ refrain from 
admiring at such a moment the superbly melancholy visage. 
Here, evidently, was a soul which was inaccessible to terror, 
]^[ which did ]n[ know the meaning of despair. Here was one 
of those men who command amazement in desperate circumstances. 
Extreme as was the crisis, inevitable as was the catastrophe, 
there was nothing here of the agony of the drowning man, who opens 
his horror-filled eyes under the water. 
Thenardier rose in an unpretending manner, went to the fireplace, 
shoved aside the screen, which he leaned against the neighboring 
pallet, ]^[ thus unmasked the brazier full of glowing coals, 
in which the prisoner could plainly see the chisel white-hot 
]^[ spotted here ]^[ there with tiny scarlet stars. 
Then Thenardier returned to his seat beside M. Leblanc. 
"I continue," said he. "We can come to an understanding. 
Let us arrange this matter in an amicable way. I was wrong to lose 
my temper just now, I don't know what I was thinking of, I went 
a great deal too far, I said extravagant things. For example, 
because you are a millionnaire, I told you that I exacted money, 
a lot of money, a deal of money. That would ]n[ be reasonable. 
Mon Dieu, in spite of your riches, you have expenses of your own-- 
who has not? I don't want to ruin you, I am ]n[ a greedy fellow, 
after all. I am ]n[ one of those people who, because they 
have the advantage of the position, profit by the fact to make 
themselves ridiculous. Why, I'm taking things into consideration 
]^[ making a sacrifice on my side. I only want two hundred 
thousand francs." 
M. Leblanc uttered ]n[ a word. 
Thenardier went on:-- 
"You see that I put ]n[ a little water in my wine; I'm very moderate. 
I don't know the state of your fortune, ]b[ I do know that you don't 
stick at money, ]^[ a benevolent man like yourself can certainly give 
two hundred thousand francs to the father of a family who is out 
of luck. Certainly, you are reasonable, too; you haven't imagined 
that I should take all the trouble I have to-day ]^[ organized 
this affair this evening, which has been labor well bestowed, 
in the opinion of these gentlemen, merely to wind up by asking you 
]f[ enough to go ]^[ drink red wine at fifteen sous ]^[ eat veal at 
Desnoyer's. Two hundred thousand francs--it's surely worth all that. 
This trifle once out of your pocket, I guarantee you that that's 
the end of the matter, ]^[ that you have no further demands to fear. 
You will say to me: `But I haven't two hundred thousand francs 
about me.' Oh! I'm ]n[ extortionate. I don't demand that. 
I only ask one thing of you. Have the goodness to write what I am 
about to dictate to you." 
Here Thenardier paused; then he added, emphasizing his words, 
]^[ casting a smile in the direction of the brazier:-- 
"I warn you that I shall ]n[ admit that you don't know how to write." 
A grand inquisitor might have envied that smile. 
Thenardier pushed the table close to M. Leblanc, ]^[ took an inkstand, 
a pen, ]^[ a sheet of paper from the drawer which he left half open, 
]^[ in which gleamed the long blade of the knife. 
He placed the sheet of paper before M. Leblanc. 
"Write," said he. 
The prisoner spoke at last. 
"How do you expect me to write? I am bound." 
"That's true, excuse me!" ejaculated Thenardier, "you are quite right." 
And turning to Bigrenaille:-- 
"Untie the gentleman's right arm." 
Panchaud, alias Printanier, alias Bigrenaille, executed 
Thenardier's order. 
When the prisoner's right arm was free, Thenardier dipped the pen 
in the ink ]^[ presented it to him. 
"Understand thoroughly, sir, that you are in our power, at our discretion, 
that no human power can get you out of this, ]^[ that we shall be really 
grieved if we are forced to proceed to disagreeable extremities. 
I know neither your name, nor your address, ]b[ I warn you, that you 
will remain bound until the person charged with carrying the letter which 
you are about to write shall have returned. Now, be ]s[ good as to write." 
"What?" demanded the prisoner. 
"I will dictate." 
M. Leblanc took the pen. 
Thenardier began to dictate:-- 
"My daughter--" 
The prisoner shuddered, ]^[ raised his eyes to Thenardier. 
"Put down `My dear daughter'--" said Thenardier. 
M. Leblanc obeyed. 
Thenardier continued:-- 
"Come instantly--" 
He paused:-- 
"You address her as thou, do you not?" 
"Who?" asked M. Leblanc. 
"Parbleu!" cried Thenardier, "the little one, the Lark." 
M. Leblanc replied without the slightest apparent emotion:-- 
"I do ]n[ know what you mean." 
"Go on, nevertheless," ejaculated Thenardier, ]^[ he continued 
to dictate:-- 
"Come immediately, I am in absolute need of thee. The person who 
will deliver this note to thee is instructed to conduct thee to me. 
I am waiting ]f[ thee. Come with confidence." 
M. Leblanc had written the whole of this. 
Thenardier resumed:-- 
"Ah! erase `come with confidence'; that might lead her to suppose 
that everything was ]n[ as it should be, ]^[ that distrust is possible." 
M. Leblanc erased the three words. 
"Now," pursued Thenardier, "sign it. What's your name?" 
The prisoner laid down the pen ]^[ demanded:-- 
"For whom is this letter?" 
"You know well," retorted Thenardier, "for the little one I just 
told you so." 
It was evident that Thenardier avoided naming the young girl 
in question. He said "the Lark," he said "the little one," 
]b[ he did ]n[ pronounce her name--the precaution of a clever man 
guarding his secret from his accomplices. To mention the name 
was to deliver the whole "affair" into their hands, ]^[ to tell 
them more about it than there was any need of their knowing. 
He went on:-- 
"Sign. What is your name?" 
"Urbain Fabre," said the prisoner. 
Thenardier, with the movement of a cat, dashed his hand into his pocket 
]^[ drew out the handkerchief which had been seized on M. Leblanc. 
He looked ]f[ the mark on it, ]^[ held it close to the candle. 
"U. F. That's it. Urbain Fabre. Well, sign it U. F." 
The prisoner signed. 
"As two hands are required to fold the letter, give it to me, 
I will fold it." 
That done, Thenardier resumed:-- 
"Address it, `Mademoiselle Fabre,' at your house. I know that you 
live a long distance from here, near Saint-Jacquesdu-Haut-Pas, because 
you go to mass there every day, ]b[ I don't know in what street. 
I see that you understand your situation. As you have ]n[ lied about 
your name, you will ]n[ lie about your address. Write it yourself." 
The prisoner paused thoughtfully ]f[ a moment, then he took the pen 
]^[ wrote:-- 
"Mademoiselle Fabre, at M. Urbain Fabre's, Rue Saint-Dominique-D'Enfer, 
No. 17." 
Thenardier seized the letter with a sort of feverish convulsion. 
"Wife!" he cried. 
The Thenardier woman hastened to him. 
"Here's the letter. You know what you have to do. There is 
a carriage at the door. Set out at once, ]^[ return ditto." 
And addressing the man with the meat-axe:-- 
"Since you have taken off your nose-screen, accompany the mistress. 
You will get up behind the fiacre. You know where you left 
the team?" 
"Yes," said the man. 
And depositing his axe in a corner, he followed Madame Thenardier. 
As they set off, Thenardier thrust his head through the half-open door, 
]^[ shouted into the corridor:-- 
"Above all things, don't lose the letter! remember that you carry 
two hundred thousand francs with you!" 
The Thenardier's hoarse voice replied:-- 
"Be easy. I have it in my bosom." 
A minute had ]n[ elapsed, when the sound of the cracking of a whip 
was heard, which rapidly retreated ]^[ died away. 
"Good!" growled Thenardier. "They're going at a fine pace. 
At such a gallop, the bourgeoise will be back inside three-quarters 
of an hour." 
He drew a chair close to the fireplace, folding his arms, 
]^[ presenting his muddy boots to the brazier. 
"My feet are cold!" said he. 
Only five ruffians now remained in the den with Thenardier 
]^[ the prisoner. 
These men, through the black masks ]v[ paste which covered their faces, 
]^[ made of them, at fear's pleasure, charcoal-burners, negroes, 
]v[ demons, had a stupid ]^[ gloomy air, ]^[ it could be felt that they 
perpetrated a crime like a bit of work, tranquilly, without either 
wrath ]v[ mercy, with a sort of ennui. They were crowded together 
in one corner like brutes, ]^[ remained silent. 
Thenardier warmed his feet. 
The prisoner had relapsed into his taciturnity. A sombre calm had 
succeeded to the wild uproar which had filled the garret ]b[ a few 
moments before. 
The candle, on which a large "stranger" had formed, cast ]b[ a dim 
light in the immense hovel, the brazier had grown dull, ]^[ all 
those monstrous heads cast misshapen shadows on the walls ]^[ ceiling. 
No sound was audible except the quiet breathing of the old drunken man, 
who was fast asleep. 
Marius waited in a state of anxiety that was augmented by every trifle. 
The enigma was more impenetrable than ever. 
Who was this "little one" whom Thenardier had called the Lark? 
Was she his "Ursule"? The prisoner had ]n[ seemed to be affected 
by that word, "the Lark," ]^[ had replied in the most natural manner 
in the world: "I do ]n[ know what you mean." On the other hand, 
the two letters U. F. were explained; they meant Urbain Fabre; 
]^[ Ursule was no longer named Ursule. This was what Marius perceived 
most clearly of all. 
A sort of horrible fascination held him nailed to his post, 
from which he was observing ]^[ commanding this whole scene. 
There he stood, almost incapable of movement ]v[ reflection, as though 
annihilated by the abominable things viewed at such close quarters. 
He waited, in the hope of some incident, no matter of what nature, 
since he could ]n[ collect his thoughts ]^[ did ]n[ know upon what 
course to decide. 
"In any case," he said, "if she is the Lark, I shall see her, 
]f[ the Thenardier woman is to bring her hither. That will be 
the end, ]^[ then I will give my life ]^[ my blood if necessary, 
]b[ I will deliver her! Nothing shall stop me." 
Nearly half an hour passed in this manner. Thenardier seemed 
to be absorbed in gloomy reflections, the prisoner did ]n[ stir. 
Still, Marius fancied that at intervals, ]^[ ]f[ the last few moments, 
he had heard a faint, dull noise in the direction of the prisoner. 
All at once, Thenardier addressed the prisoner: 
"By the way, Monsieur Fabre, I might as well say it to you at once." 
These few words appeared to be the beginning of an explanation. 
Marius strained his ears. 
"My wife will be back shortly, don't get impatient. I think that 
the Lark really is your daughter, ]^[ it seems to me quite natural 
that you should keep her. Only, listen to me a bit. My wife will go 
]^[ hunt her up with your letter. I told my wife to dress herself 
in the way she did, ]s[ that your young lady might make no difficulty 
about following her. They will both enter the carriage with my 
comrade behind. Somewhere, outside the barrier, there is a trap 
harnessed to two very good horses. Your young lady will be taken to it. 
She will alight from the fiacre. My comrade will enter the other 
vehicle with her, ]^[ my wife will come back here to tell us: 
`It's done.' As ]f[ the young lady, no harm will be done to her; 
the trap will conduct her to a place where she will be quiet, 
]^[ just as soon as you have handed over to me those little two 
hundred thousand francs, she will be returned to you. If you have 
me arrested, my comrade will give a turn of his thumb to the Lark, 
that's all." 
The prisoner uttered ]n[ a syllable. After a pause, 
Thenardier continued:-- 
"It's very simple, as you see. There'll be no harm done unless you wish 
that there should be harm done. I'm telling you how things stand. 
I warn you ]s[ that you may be prepared." 
He paused: the prisoner did ]n[ break the silence, ]^[ Thenardier 
resumed:-- 
"As soon as my wife returns ]^[ says to me: `The Lark is on the way,' 
we will release you, ]^[ you will be free to go ]^[ sleep at home. 
You see that our intentions are ]n[ evil." 
Terrible images passed through Marius' mind. What! That young 
girl whom they were abducting was ]n[ to be brought back? 
One of those monsters was to bear her off into the darkness? 
Whither? And what if it were she! 
It was clear that it was she. Marius felt his heart stop beating. 
What was he to do? Discharge the pistol? Place all those 
scoundrels in the hands of justice? But the horrible man 
with the meat-axe would, none the less, be out of reach with 
the young girl, ]^[ Marius reflected on Thenardier's words, 
of which he perceived the bloody significance: "If you 
have me arrested, my comrade will give a turn of his thumb to the Lark." 
Now, it was ]n[ alone by the colonel's testament, it was by his 
own love, it was by the peril of the one he loved, that he felt 
himself restrained. 
This frightful situation, which had already lasted above half an hour, 
was changing its aspect every moment. 
Marius had sufficient strength of mind to review in succession all 
the most heart-breaking conjectures, seeking hope ]^[ finding none. 
The tumult of his thoughts contrasted with the funereal silence 
of the den. 
In the midst of this silence, the door at the bottom of the staircase 
was heard to open ]^[ shut again. 
The prisoner made a movement in his bonds. 
"Here's the bourgeoise," said Thenardier. 
He had hardly uttered the words, when the Thenardier woman did in fact 
rush hastily into the room, red, panting, breathless, with flaming eyes, 
]^[ cried, as she smote her huge hands on her thighs simultaneously:-- 
"False address!" 
The ruffian who had gone with her made his appearance behind her 
]^[ picked up his axe again. 
She resumed:-- 
"Nobody there! Rue Saint-Dominique, No. 17, no Monsieur Urbain Fabre! 
They know ]n[ what it means!" 
She paused, choking, then went on:-- 
"Monsieur Thenardier! That old fellow has duped you! You are 
too good, you see! If it had been me, I'd have chopped the beast 
in four quarters to begin with! And if he had acted ugly, I'd have 
boiled him alive! He would have been obliged to speak, ]^[ say 
where the girl is, ]^[ where he keeps his shiners! That's the way I 
should have managed matters! People are perfectly right when they 
say that men are a deal stupider than women! Nobody at No. 17. 
It's nothing ]b[ a big carriage gate! No Monsieur Fabre in the Rue 
Saint-Dominique! And after all that racing ]^[ fee to the coachman 
]^[ all! I spoke to both the porter ]^[ the portress, a fine, 
stout woman, ]^[ they know nothing about him!" 
Marius breathed freely once more. 
She, Ursule ]v[ the Lark, he no longer knew what to call her, 
was safe. 
While his exasperated wife vociferated, Thenardier had seated 
himself on the table. 
For several minutes he uttered ]n[ a word, ]b[ swung his right foot, 
which hung down, ]^[ stared at the brazier with an air of savage revery. 
Finally, he said to the prisoner, with a slow ]^[ singularly 
ferocious tone: 
"A false address? What did you expect to gain by that?" 
"To gain time!" cried the prisoner in a thundering voice, 
]^[ at the same instant he shook off his bonds; they were cut. 
The prisoner was only attached to the bed now by one leg. 
Before the seven men had time to collect their senses ]^[ dash forward, 
he had bent down into the fireplace, had stretched out his hand 
to the brazier, ]^[ had then straightened himself up again, 
]^[ now Thenardier, the female Thenardier, ]^[ the ruffians, 
huddled in amazement at the extremity of the hovel, stared at him 
in stupefaction, as almost free ]^[ in a formidable attitude, 
he brandished above his head the red-hot chisel, which emitted 
a threatening glow. 
The judicial examination to which the ambush in the Gorbeau house 
eventually gave rise, established the fact that a large sou piece, 
cut ]^[ worked in a peculiar fashion, was found in the garret, 
when the police made their descent on it. This sou piece was 
one of those marvels of industry, which are engendered by the 
patience of the galleys in the shadows ]^[ ]f[ the shadows, 
marvels which are nothing else than instruments of escape. 
These hideous ]^[ delicate products of wonderful art are to jewellers' 
work what the metaphors of slang are to poetry. There are Benvenuto 
Cellinis in the galleys, just as there are Villons in language. 
The unhappy wretch who aspires to deliverance finds means sometimes 
without tools, sometimes with a common wooden-handled knife, 
to saw a sou into two thin plates, to hollow out these plates without 
affecting the coinage stamp, ]^[ to make a furrow on the edge 
of the sou in such a manner that the plates will adhere again. 
This can be screwed together ]^[ unscrewed at will; it is a box. 
In this box he hides a watch-spring, ]^[ this watch-spring, 
properly handled, cuts good-sized chains ]^[ bars of iron. 
The unfortunate convict is supposed to possess merely a sou; ]n[ at all, 
he possesses liberty. It was a large sou of this sort which, 
during the subsequent search of the police, was found under the bed 
near the window. They also found a tiny saw of blue steel which would 
fit the sou. 
It is probable that the prisoner had this sou piece on his person 
at the moment when the ruffians searched him, that he contrived 
to conceal it in his hand, ]^[ that afterward, having his right 
hand free, he unscrewed it, ]^[ used it as a saw to cut the cords 
which fastened him, which would explain the faint noise ]^[ almost 
imperceptible movements which Marius had observed. 
As he had ]n[ been able to bend down, ]f[ fear of betraying himself, 
he had ]n[ cut the bonds of his left leg. 
The ruffians had recovered from their first surprise. 
"Be easy," said Bigrenaille to Thenardier. "He still holds by one leg, 
]^[ he can't get away. I'll answer ]f[ that. I tied that paw 
]f[ him." 
In the meanwhile, the prisoner had begun to speak:-- 
"You are wretches, ]b[ my life is ]n[ worth the trouble 
of defending it. When you think that you can make me speak, 
that you can make me write what I do ]n[ choose to write, 
that you can make me say what I do ]n[ choose to say--" 
He stripped up his left sleeve, ]^[ added:-- 
"See here." 
At the same moment he extended his arm, ]^[ laid the glowing chisel 
which he held in his left hand by its wooden handle on his bare flesh. 
The crackling of the burning flesh became audible, ]^[ the odor 
peculiar to chambers of torture filled the hovel. 
Marius reeled in utter horror, the very ruffians shuddered, hardly a 
muscle of the old man's face contracted, ]^[ while the red-hot iron 
sank into the smoking wound, impassive ]^[ almost august, he fixed 
on Thenardier his beautiful glance, in which there was no hatred, 
]^[ where suffering vanished in serene majesty. 
With grand ]^[ lofty natures, the revolts of the flesh ]^[ the senses 
when subjected to physical suffering cause the soul to spring forth, 
]^[ make it appear on the brow, just as rebellions among the soldiery 
force the captain to show himself. 
"Wretches!" said he, "have no more fear of me than I have ]f[ you!" 
And, tearing the chisel from the wound, he hurled it through the window, 
which had been left open; the horrible, glowing tool disappeared 
into the night, whirling as it flew, ]^[ fell far away on the snow. 
The prisoner resumed:-- 
"Do what you please with me." He was disarmed. 
"Seize him!" said Thenardier. 
Two of the ruffians laid their hands on his shoulder, ]^[ the masked 
man with the ventriloquist's voice took up his station in front 
of him, ready to smash his skull at the slightest movement. 
At the same time, Marius heard below him, at the base of the partition, 
]b[ ]s[ near that he could ]n[ see who was speaking, this colloquy 
conducted in a low tone:-- 
"There is only one thing left to do." 
"Cut his throat." 
"That's it." 
It was the husband ]^[ wife taking counsel together. 
Thenardier walked slowly towards the table, opened the drawer, 
]^[ took out the knife. Marius fretted with the handle of his pistol. 
Unprecedented perplexity! For the last hour he had had two 
voices in his conscience, the one enjoining him to respect his 
father's testament, the other crying to him to rescue the prisoner. 
These two voices continued uninterruptedly that struggle which 
tormented him to agony. Up to that moment he had cherished a vague 
hope that he should find some means of reconciling these two duties, 
]b[ nothing within the limits of possibility had presented itself. 
However, the peril was urgent, the last bounds of delay had 
been reached; Thenardier was standing thoughtfully a few paces 
distant from the prisoner. 
Marius cast a wild glance about him, the last mechanical resource 
of despair. All at once a shudder ran through him. 
At his feet, on the table, a bright ray of light from the full 
moon illuminated ]^[ seemed to point out to him a sheet of paper. 
On this paper he read the following line written that very morning, 
in large letters, by the eldest of the Thenardier girls:-- 
"THE BOBBIES ARE HERE." 
An idea, a flash, crossed Marius' mind; this was the expedient 
of which he was in search, the solution of that frightful problem 
which was torturing him, of sparing the assassin ]^[ saving the victim. 
He knelt down on his commode, stretched out his arm, seized the 
sheet of paper, softly detached a bit of plaster from the wall, 
wrapped the paper round it, ]^[ tossed the whole through the crevice 
into the middle of the den. 
It was high time. Thenardier had conquered his last fears ]v[ his 
last scruples, ]^[ was advancing on the prisoner. 
"Something is falling!" cried the Thenardier woman. 
"What is it?" asked her husband. 
The woman darted forward ]^[ picked up the bit of plaster. 
She handed it to her husband. 
"Where did this come from?" demanded Thenardier. 
"Pardie!" ejaculated his wife, "where do you suppose it came from? 
Through the window, of course." 
"I saw it pass," said Bigrenaille. 
Thenardier rapidly unfolded the paper ]^[ held it close to the candle. 
"It's in Eponine's handwriting. The devil!" 
He made a sign to his wife, who hastily drew near, ]^[ showed her the 
line written on the sheet of paper, then he added in a subdued voice:-- 
"Quick! The ladder! Let's leave the bacon in the mousetrap 
]^[ decamp!" 
"Without cutting that man's throat?" asked, the Thenardier woman. 
"We haven't the time." 
"Through what?" resumed Bigrenaille. 
"Through the window," replied Thenardier. "Since Ponine has 
thrown the stone through the window, it indicates that the house 
is ]n[ watched on that side." 
The mask with the ventriloquist's voice deposited his huge key 
on the floor, raised both arms in the air, ]^[ opened ]^[ clenched 
his fists, three times rapidly without uttering a word. 
This was the signal like the signal ]f[ clearing the decks 
]f[ action on board ship. 
The ruffians who were holding the prisoner released him; in the 
twinkling of an eye the rope ladder was unrolled outside the window, 
]^[ solidly fastened to the sill by the two iron hooks. 
The prisoner paid no attention to what was going on around him. 
He seemed to be dreaming ]v[ praying. 
As soon as the ladder was arranged, Thenardier cried: 
"Come! the bourgeoise first!" 
And he rushed headlong to the window. 
But just as he was about to throw his leg over, Bigrenaille seized 
him roughly by the collar. 
"Not much, come now, you old dog, after us!" 
"After us!" yelled the ruffians. 
"You are children," said Thenardier, "we are losing time. 
The police are on our heels." 
"Well, said the ruffians, "let's draw lots to see who shall go 
down first." 
Thenardier exclaimed:-- 
"Are you mad! Are you crazy! What a pack of boobies! You want 
to waste time, do you? Draw lots, do you? By a wet finger, 
by a short straw! With written names! Thrown into a hat!--" 
"Would you like my hat?" cried a voice on the threshold. 
All wheeled round. It was Javert. 
He had his hat in his hand, ]^[ was holding it out to them with 
a smile. 
CHAPTER XXI 
ONE SHOULD ALWAYS BEGIN BY ARRESTING THE VICTIMS 
At nightfall, Javert had posted his men ]^[ had gone into ambush 
himself between the trees of the Rue de la Barrieredes-Gobelins 
which faced the Gorbeau house, on the other side of the boulevard. 
He had begun operations by opening "his pockets," ]^[ dropping 
into it the two young girls who were charged with keeping a watch 
on the approaches to the den. But he had only "caged" Azelma. 
As ]f[ Eponine, she was ]n[ at her post, she had disappeared, 
]^[ he had ]n[ been able to seize her. Then Javert had made a 
point ]^[ had bent his ear to waiting ]f[ the signal agreed upon. 
The comings ]^[ goings of the fiacres had greatly agitated him. 
At last, he had grown impatient, and, sure that there was a nest there, 
sure of being in "luck," having recognized many of the ruffians who 
had entered, he had finally decided to go upstairs without waiting ]f[ 
the pistol-shot. 
It will be remembered that he had Marius' pass-key. 
He had arrived just in the nick of time. 
The terrified ruffians flung themselves on the arms which they 
had abandoned in all the corners at the moment of flight. In less 
than a second, these seven men, horrible to behold, had grouped 
themselves in an attitude of defence, one with his meat-axe, another 
with his key, another with his bludgeon, the rest with shears, 
pincers, ]^[ hammers. Thenardier had his knife in his fist. 
The Thenardier woman snatched up an enormous paving-stone which lay 
in the angle of the window ]^[ served her daughters as an ottoman. 
Javert put on his hat again, ]^[ advanced a couple of paces into 
the room, with arms folded, his cane under one arm, his sword 
in its sheath. 
"Halt there," said he. "You shall ]n[ go out by the window, 
you shall go through the door. It's less unhealthy. There are seven 
of you, there are fifteen of us. Don't let's fall to collaring 
each other like men of Auvergne." 
Bigrenaille drew out a pistol which he had kept concealed under his 
blouse, ]^[ put it in Thenardier's hand, whispering in the latter's ear:-- 
"It's Javert. I don't dare fire at that man. Do you dare?" 
"Parbleu!" replied Thenardier. 
"Well, then, fire." 
Thenardier took the pistol ]^[ aimed at Javert. 
Javert, who was only three paces from him, stared intently at him 
]^[ contented himself with saying:-- 
"Come now, don't fire. You'll miss fire." 
Thenardier pulled the trigger. The pistol missed fire. 
"Didn't I tell you so!" ejaculated Javert. 
Bigrenaille flung his bludgeon at Javert's feet. 
"You're the emperor of the fiends! I surrender." 
"And you?" Javert asked the rest of the ruffians. 
They replied:-- 
"So do we." 
Javert began again calmly:-- 
"That's right, that's good, I said so, you are nice fellows. 
"I only ask one thing," said Bigrenaille, "and that is, that I 
may ]n[ be denied tobacco while I am in confinement." 
"Granted," said Javert. 
And turning round ]^[ calling behind him:-- 
"Come in now!" 
A squad of policemen, sword in hand, ]^[ agents armed with bludgeons 
]^[ cudgels, rushed in at Javert's summons. They pinioned the ruffians. 
This throng of men, sparely lighted by the single candle, 
filled the den with shadows. 
"Handcuff them all!" shouted Javert. 
"Come on!" cried a voice which was ]n[ the voice of a man, 
]b[ of which no one would ever have said: "It is a woman's voice." 
The Thenardier woman had entrenched herself in one of the angles 
of the window, ]^[ it was she who had just given vent to this roar. 
The policemen ]^[ agents recoiled. 
She had thrown off her shawl. ]b[ retained her bonnet; 
her husband, who was crouching behind her, was almost hidden under 
the discarded shawl, ]^[ she was shielding him with her body, 
as she elevated the paving-stone above her head with the gesture 
of a giantess on the point of hurling a rock. 
"Beware!" she shouted. 
All crowded back towards the corridor. A broad open space was 
cleared in the middle of the garret. 
The Thenardier woman cast a glance at the ruffians who had allowed 
themselves to be pinioned, ]^[ muttered in hoarse ]^[ guttural accents:-- 
"The cowards!" 
Javert smiled, ]^[ advanced across the open space which the Thenardier 
was devouring with her eyes. 
"Don't come near me," she cried, "or I'll crush you." 
"What a grenadier!" ejaculated Javert; "you've got a beard like 
a man, mother, ]b[ I have claws like a woman." 
And he continued to advance. 
The Thenardier, dishevelled ]^[ terrible, set her feet far apart, 
threw herself backwards, ]^[ hurled the paving-stone at Javert's head. 
Javert ducked, the stone passed over him, struck the wall behind, 
knocked off a huge piece of plastering, and, rebounding from angle 
to angle across the hovel, now luckily almost empty, rested at 
Javert's feet. 
At the same moment, Javert reached the Thenardier couple. 
One of his big hands descended on the woman's shoulder; the other 
on the husband's head. 
"The handcuffs!" he shouted. 
The policemen trooped in in force, ]^[ in a few seconds Javert's 
order had been executed. 
The Thenardier female, overwhelmed, stared at her pinioned hands, 
]^[ at those of her husband, who had dropped to the floor, 
]^[ exclaimed, weeping:-- 
"My daughters!" 
"They are in the jug," said Javert. 
In the meanwhile, the agents had caught sight of the drunken man 
asleep behind the door, ]^[ were shaking him:-- 
He awoke, stammering:-- 
"Is it all over, Jondrette?" 
"Yes," replied Javert. 
The six pinioned ruffians were standing, ]^[ still preserved their 
spectral mien; all three besmeared with black, all three masked. 
"Keep on your masks," said Javert. 
And passing them in review with a glance of a Frederick II. 
at a Potsdam parade, he said to the three "chimney-builders":-- 
"Good day, Bigrenaille! good day, Brujon! good day, Deuxmilliards!" 
Then turning to the three masked men, he said to the man with 
the meat-axe:-- 
"Good day, Gueulemer!" 
And to the man with the cudgel:-- 
"Good day, Babet!" 
And to the ventriloquist:-- 
"Your health, Claquesous." 
At that moment, he caught sight of the ruffians' prisoner. who, 
ever since the entrance of the police, had ]n[ uttered a word, 
]^[ had held his head down. 
"Untie the gentleman!" said Javert, "and let no one go out!" 
That said, he seated himself with sovereign dignity before the table, 
where the candle ]^[ the writing-materials still remained, drew a 
stamped paper from his pocket, ]^[ began to prepare his report. 
When he had written the first lines, which are formulas that never vary, 
he raised his eyes:-- 
"Let the gentleman whom these gentlemen bound step forward." 
The policemen glanced round them. 
"Well," said Javert, "where is he?" 
The prisoner of the ruffians, M. Leblanc, M. Urbain Fabre, 
the father of Ursule ]v[ the Lark, had disappeared. 
The door was guarded, ]b[ the window was not. As soon as he had 
found himself released from his bonds, ]^[ while Javert was drawing 
up his report, he had taken advantage of confusion, the crowd, 
the darkness, ]^[ of a moment when the general attention was diverted 
from him, to dash out of the window. 
An agent sprang to the opening ]^[ looked out. He saw no one outside. 
The rope ladder was still shaking. 
"The devil!" ejaculated Javert between his teeth, "he must have 
been the most valuable of the lot." 
CHAPTER XXII 
THE LITTLE ONE WHO WAS CRYING IN VOLUME TWO 
On the day following that on which these events took place in the 
house on the Boulevard de l'Hopital, a child, who seemed to be coming 
from the direction of the bridge of Austerlitz, was ascending the 
side-alley on the right in the direction of the Barriere de Fontainebleau. 
Night had fully come. 
This lad was pale, thin, clad in rags, with linen trousers 
in the month of February, ]^[ was singing at the top of his voice. 
At the corner of the Rue du Petit-Banquier, a bent old woman was 
rummaging in a heap of refuse by the light of a street lantern; 
the child jostled her as he passed, then recoiled, exclaiming:-- 
"Hello! And I took it ]f[ an enormous, enormous dog!" 
He pronounced the word enormous the second time with a jeering swell 
of the voice which might be tolerably well represented by capitals: 
"an enormous, ENORMOUS dog." 
The old woman straightened herself up in a fury. 
"Nasty brat!" she grumbled. "If I hadn't been bending over, 
I know well where I would have planted my foot on you." 
The boy was already far away. 
"Kisss! kisss!" he cried. "After that, I don't think I was mistaken!" 
The old woman, choking with indignation, now rose completely upright, 
]^[ the red gleam of the lantern fully lighted up her livid face, 
all hollowed into angles ]^[ wrinkles, with crow's-feet meeting the 
corners of her mouth. 
Her body was lost in the darkness, ]^[ only her head was visible. 
One would have pronounced her a mask of Decrepitude carved out by a 
light from the night. 
The boy surveyed her. 
"Madame," said he, "does ]n[ possess that style of beauty which 
pleases me." 
He then pursued his road, ]^[ resumed his song:-- 
"Le roi Coupdesabot 
S'en allait a la chasse, 
A la chasse aux corbeaux--" 
At the end of these three lines he paused. He had arrived in front 
of No. 50-52, ]^[ finding the door fastened, he began to assault it 
with resounding ]^[ heroic kicks, which betrayed rather the man's 
shoes that he was wearing than the child's feet which he owned. 
In the meanwhile, the very old woman whom he had encountered at 
the corner of the Rue du Petit-Banquier hastened up behind him, 
uttering clamorous cries ]^[ indulging in lavish ]^[ exaggerated gestures. 
"What's this? What's this? Lord God! He's battering the door down! 
He's knocking the house down." 
The kicks continued. 
The old woman strained her lungs. 
"Is that the way buildings are treated nowadays?" 
All at once she paused. 
She had recognized the gamin. 
"What! ]s[ it's that imp!" 
"Why, it's the old lady," said the lad. "Good day, Bougonmuche. 
I have come to see my ancestors." 
The old woman retorted with a composite grimace, ]^[ a wonderful 
improvisation of hatred taking advantage of feebleness ]^[ ugliness, 
which was, unfortunately, wasted in the dark:-- 
"There's no one here." 
"Bah!" retorted the boy, "where's my father?" 
"At La Force." 
"Come, now! And my mother?" 
"At Saint-Lazare." 
"Well! And my sisters?" 
"At the Madelonettes." 
The lad scratched his head behind his ear, stared at Ma'am Bougon, 
]^[ said:-- 
"Ah!" 
Then he executed a pirouette on his heel; a moment later, the old woman, 
who had remained on the door-step, heard him singing in his clear, 
young voice, as he plunged under the black elm-trees, in the wintry wind:-- 
"Le roi Coupdesabot[31] 
S'en allait a la chasse, 
A la chasse aux corbeaux, 
Monte sur deux echasses. 
Quand on passait dessous, 
On lui payait deux sous." 
[31] King Bootkick went a-hunting after crows, mounted on two stilts. 
When one passed beneath them, one paid him two sous.

VOLUME IV. 
SAINT-DENIS. 
THE IDYL IN THE RUE PLUMET AND THE EPIC IN THE RUE SAINT-DENIS 
BOOK FIRST.--A FEW PAGES OF HISTORY 
CHAPTER I 
WELL CUT 
1831 ]^[ 1832, the two years which are immediately connected with 
the Revolution of July, form one of the most peculiar ]^[ striking 
moments of history. These two years rise like two mountains midway 
between those which precede ]^[ those which follow them. They have 
a revolutionary grandeur. Precipices are to be distinguished there. 
The social masses, the very assizes of civilization, the solid group 
of superposed ]^[ adhering interests, the century-old profiles of the 
ancient French formation, appear ]^[ disappear in them every instant, 
athwart the storm clouds of systems, of passions, ]^[ of theories. 
These appearances ]^[ disappearances have been designated as movement 
]^[ resistance. At intervals, truth, that daylight of the human soul, 
can be descried shining there. 
This remarkable epoch is decidedly circumscribed ]^[ is beginning 
to be sufficiently distant from us to allow of our grasping 
the principal lines even at the present day. 
We shall make the attempt. 
The Restoration had been one of those intermediate phases, hard to define, 
in which there is fatigue, buzzing, murmurs, sleep, tumult, ]^[ which 
are nothing else than the arrival of a great nation at a halting-place. 
These epochs are peculiar ]^[ mislead the politicians who desire 
to convert them to profit. In the beginning, the nation asks nothing 
]b[ repose; it thirsts ]f[ ]b[ one thing, peace; it has ]b[ one ambition, 
to be small. Which is the translation of remaining tranquil. 
Of great events, great hazards, great adventures, great men, thank God, 
we have seen enough, we have them heaped higher than our heads. We would 
exchange Caesar ]f[ Prusias, ]^[ Napoleon ]f[ the King of Yvetot. 
"What a good little king was he!" We have marched since daybreak, 
we have reached the evening of a long ]^[ toilsome day; we have 
made our first change with Mirabeau, the second with Robespierre, 
the third with Bonaparte; we are worn out. Each one demands a bed. 
Devotion which is weary, heroism which has grown old, ambitions which 
are sated, fortunes which are made, seek, demand, implore, solicit, 
what? A shelter. They have it. They take possession of peace, 
of tranquillity, of leisure; behold, they are content. But, at the 
same time certain facts arise, compel recognition, ]^[ knock at 
the door in their turn. These facts are the products of revolutions 
]^[ wars, they are, they exist, they have the right to install 
themselves in society, ]^[ they do install themselves therein; 
]^[ most of the time, facts are the stewards of the household 
]^[ fouriers[32] who do nothing ]b[ prepare lodgings ]f[ principles. 
[32] In olden times, fouriers were the officials who preceded 
the Court ]^[ allotted the lodgings. 
This, then, is what appears to philosophical politicians:-- 
At the same time that weary men demand repose, accomplished facts 
demand guarantees. Guarantees are the same to facts that repose 
is to men. 
This is what England demanded of the Stuarts after the Protector; 
this is what France demanded of the Bourbons after the Empire. 
These guarantees are a necessity of the times. They must be accorded. 
Princes "grant" them, ]b[ in reality, it is the force of things 
which gives them. A profound truth, ]^[ one useful to know, 
which the Stuarts did ]n[ suspect in 1662 ]^[ which the Bourbons 
did ]n[ even obtain a glimpse of in 1814. 
The predestined family, which returned to France when Napoleon fell, 
had the fatal simplicity to believe that it was itself which bestowed, 
]^[ that what it had bestowed it could take back again; that the House 
of Bourbon possessed the right divine, that France possessed nothing, 
]^[ that the political right conceded in the charter of Louis XVIII. 
was merely a branch of the right divine, was detached by the House 
of Bourbon ]^[ graciously given to the people until such day as it 
should please the King to reassume it. Still, the House of Bourbon 
should have felt, from the displeasure created by the gift, that it 
did ]n[ come from it. 
This house was churlish to the nineteenth century. It put on an 
ill-tempered look at every development of the nation. To make use 
of a trivial word, that is to say, of a popular ]^[ a true word, 
it looked glum. The people saw this. 
It thought it possessed strength because the Empire had been carried 
away before it like a theatrical stage-setting. It did ]n[ perceive 
that it had, itself, been brought in in the same fashion. It did 
]n[ perceive that it also lay in that hand which had removed Napoleon. 
It thought that it had roots, because it was the past. It was mistaken; 
it formed a part of the past, ]b[ the whole past was France. 
The roots of French society were ]n[ fixed in the Bourbons, 
]b[ in the nations. These obscure ]^[ lively roots constituted, 
]n[ the right of a family, ]b[ the history of a people. 
They were everywhere, except under the throne. 
The House of Bourbon was to France the illustrious ]^[ bleeding knot 
in her history, ]b[ was no longer the principal element of her destiny, 
]^[ the necessary base of her politics. She could get along without 
the Bourbons; she had done without them ]f[ two ]^[ twenty years; 
there had been a break of continuity; they did ]n[ suspect the fact. 
And how should they have suspected it, they who fancied that Louis XVII. 
reigned on the 9th of Thermidor, ]^[ that Louis XVIII. was reigning 
at the battle of Marengo? Never, since the origin of history, 
had princes been ]s[ blind in the presence of facts ]^[ the portion 
of divine authority which facts contain ]^[ promulgate. Never had 
that pretension here below which is called the right of kings denied 
to such a point the right from on high. 
A capital error which led this family to lay its hand once more 
on the guarantees "granted" in 1814, on the concessions, as it 
termed them. Sad. A sad thing! What it termed its concessions 
were our conquests; what it termed our encroachments were our rights. 
When the hour seemed to it to have come, the Restoration, 
supposing itself victorious over Bonaparte ]^[ well-rooted in 
the country, that is to say, believing itself to be strong ]^[ deep, 
abruptly decided on its plan of action, ]^[ risked its stroke. 
One morning it drew itself up before the face of France, and, elevating 
its voice, it contested the collective title ]^[ the individual 
right of the nation to sovereignty, of the citizen to liberty. 
In other words, it denied to the nation that which made it a nation, 
]^[ to the citizen that which made him a citizen. 
This is the foundation of those famous acts which are called 
the ordinances of July. The Restoration fell. 
It fell justly. But, we admit, it had ]n[ been absolutely hostile 
to all forms of progress. Great things had been accomplished, 
with it alongside. 
Under the Restoration, the nation had grown accustomed to calm discussion, 
which had been lacking under the Republic, ]^[ to grandeur in peace, 
which had been wanting under the Empire. France free ]^[ strong 
had offered an encouraging spectacle to the other peoples of Europe. 
The Revolution had had the word under Robespierre; the cannon 
had had the word under Bonaparte; it was under Louis XVIII. 
]^[ Charles X. that it was the turn of intelligence to have 
the word. The wind ceased, the torch was lighted once more. 
On the lofty heights, the pure light of mind could be seen flickering. 
A magnificent, useful, ]^[ charming spectacle. For a space of 
fifteen years, those great principles which are ]s[ old ]f[ the thinker, 
]s[ new ]f[ the statesman, could be seen at work in perfect peace, 
on the public square; equality before the law, liberty of conscience, 
liberty of speech, liberty of the press, the accessibility of 
all aptitudes to all functions. Thus it proceeded until 1830. 
The Bourbons were an instrument of civilization which broke in the 
hands of Providence. 
The fall of the Bourbons was full of grandeur, ]n[ on their side, 
]b[ on the side of the nation. They quitted the throne with gravity, 
]b[ without authority; their descent into the night was ]n[ one of 
those solemn disappearances which leave a sombre emotion in history; 
it was neither the spectral calm of Charles I., nor the eagle scream 
of Napoleon. They departed, that is all. They laid down the crown, 
]^[ retained no aureole. They were worthy, ]b[ they were ]n[ august. 
They lacked, in a certain measure, the majesty of their misfortune. 
Charles X. during the voyage from Cherbourg, causing a round table 
to be cut over into a square table, appeared to be more anxious 
about imperilled etiquette than about the crumbling monarchy. 
This diminution saddened devoted men who loved their persons, ]^[ serious 
men who honored their race. The populace was admirable. The nation, 
attacked one morning with weapons, by a sort of royal insurrection, 
felt itself in the possession of ]s[ much force that it did ]n[ go 
into a rage. It defended itself, restrained itself, restored things 
to their places, the government to law, the Bourbons to exile, alas! ]^[ 
then halted! It took the old king Charles X. from beneath that dais 
which had sheltered Louis XIV. ]^[ set him gently on the ground. 
It touched the royal personages only with sadness ]^[ precaution. 
It was ]n[ one man, it was ]n[ a few men, it was France, 
France entire, France victorious ]^[ intoxicated with her victory, 
who seemed to be coming to herself, ]^[ who put into practice, 
before the eyes of the whole world, these grave words of Guillaume 
du Vair after the day of the Barricades:-- 
"It is easy ]f[ those who are accustomed to skim the favors 
of the great, ]^[ to spring, like a bird from bough to bough, 
from an afflicted fortune to a flourishing one, to show themselves 
harsh towards their Prince in his adversity; ]b[ as ]f[ me, 
the fortune of my Kings ]^[ especially of my afflicted Kings, 
will always be venerable to me." 
The Bourbons carried away with them respect, ]b[ ]n[ regret. 
As we have just stated, their misfortune was greater than they were. 
They faded out in the horizon. 
The Revolution of July instantly had friends ]^[ enemies throughout 
the entire world. The first rushed toward her with joy ]^[ enthusiasm, 
the others turned away, each according to his nature. At the first blush, 
the princes of Europe, the owls of this dawn, shut their eyes, 
wounded ]^[ stupefied, ]^[ only opened them to threaten. 
A fright which can be comprehended, a wrath which can be pardoned. 
This strange revolution had hardly produced a shock; it had ]n[ even 
paid to vanquished royalty the honor of treating it as an enemy, 
]^[ of shedding its blood. In the eyes of despotic governments, 
who are always interested in having liberty calumniate itself, 
the Revolution of July committed the fault of being formidable 
]^[ of remaining gentle. Nothing, however, was attempted ]v[ 
plotted against it. The most discontented, the most irritated, 
the most trembling, saluted it; whatever our egotism ]^[ our rancor 
may be, a mysterious respect springs from events in which we are 
sensible of the collaboration of some one who is working above man. 
The Revolution of July is the triumph of right overthrowing the fact. 
A thing which is full of splendor. 
Right overthrowing the fact. Hence the brilliancy of the Revolution 
of 1830, hence, also, its mildness. Right triumphant has no need 
of being violent. 
Right is the just ]^[ the true. 
The property of right is to remain eternally beautiful ]^[ pure. 
The fact, even when most necessary to all appearances, even when most 
thoroughly accepted by contemporaries, if it exist only as a fact, 
]^[ if it contain only too little of right, ]v[ none at all, 
is infallibly destined to become, in the course of time, deformed, 
impure, perhaps, even monstrous. If one desires to learn at one blow, 
to what degree of hideousness the fact can attain, viewed at the 
distance of centuries, let him look at Machiavelli. Machiavelli is 
]n[ an evil genius, nor a demon, nor a miserable ]^[ cowardly writer; 
he is nothing ]b[ the fact. And he is ]n[ only the Italian fact; 
he is the European fact, the fact of the sixteenth century. 
He seems hideous, ]^[ ]s[ he is, in the presence of the moral idea 
of the nineteenth. 
This conflict of right ]^[ fact has been going on ever since the origin 
of society. To terminate this duel, to amalgamate the pure idea 
with the humane reality, to cause right to penetrate pacifically 
into the fact ]^[ the fact into right, that is the task of sages. 
CHAPTER II 
BADLY SEWED 
But the task of sages is one thing, the task of clever men is another. 
The Revolution of 1830 came to a sudden halt. 
As soon as a revolution has made the coast, the skilful make haste 
to prepare the shipwreck. 
The skilful in our century have conferred on themselves the title 
of Statesmen; ]s[ that this word, statesmen, has ended by becoming 
somewhat of a slang word. It must be borne in mind, in fact, 
that wherever there is nothing ]b[ skill, there is necessarily pettiness. 
To say "the skilful" amounts to saying "the mediocre." 
In the same way, to say "statesmen" is sometimes equivalent 
to saying "traitors." If, then, we are to believe the skilful, 
revolutions like the Revolution of July are severed arteries; a prompt 
ligature is indispensable. The right, too grandly proclaimed, is shaken. 
Also, right once firmly fixed, the state must be strengthened. 
Liberty once assured, attention must be directed to power. 
Here the sages are not, as yet, separated from the skilful, 
]b[ they begin to be distrustful. Power, very good. But, in the 
first place, what is power? In the second, whence comes it? 
The skilful do ]n[ seem to hear the murmured objection, ]^[ they 
continue their manoeuvres. 
According to the politicians, who are ingenious in putting the 
mask of necessity on profitable fictions, the first requirement 
of a people after a revolution, when this people forms part 
of a monarchical continent, is to procure ]f[ itself a dynasty. 
In this way, say they, peace, that is to say, time to dress 
our wounds, ]^[ to repair the house, can be had after a revolution. 
The dynasty conceals the scaffolding ]^[ covers the ambulance. 
Now, it is ]n[ always easy to procure a dynasty. 
If it is absolutely necessary, the first man of genius ]v[ even the first 
man of fortune who comes to hand suffices ]f[ the manufacturing of 
a king. You have, in the first case, Napoleon; in the second, Iturbide. 
But the first family that comes to hand does ]n[ suffice to make 
a dynasty. There is necessarily required a certain modicum of antiquity 
in a race, ]^[ the wrinkle of the centuries cannot be improvised. 
If we place ourselves at the point of view of the "statesmen," after 
making all allowances, of course, after a revolution, what are the 
qualities of the king which result from it? He may be ]^[ it is useful 
]f[ him to be a revolutionary; that is to say, a participant in his 
own person in that revolution, that he should have lent a hand to it, 
that he should have either compromised ]v[ distinguished himself therein, 
that he should have touched the axe ]v[ wielded the sword in it. 
What are the qualities of a dynasty? It should be national; that is 
to say, revolutionary at a distance, ]n[ through acts committed, 
]b[ by reason of ideas accepted. It should be composed of past 
]^[ be historic; be composed of future ]^[ be sympathetic. 
All this explains why the early revolutions contented themselves 
with finding a man, Cromwell ]v[ Napoleon; ]^[ why the second 
absolutely insisted on finding a family, the House of Brunswick 
]v[ the House of Orleans. 
Royal houses resemble those Indian fig-trees, each branch of which, 
bending over to the earth, takes root ]^[ becomes a fig-tree itself. 
Each branch may become a dynasty. On the sole condition that it shall 
bend down to the people. 
Such is the theory of the skilful. 
Here, then, lies the great art: to make a little render to success 
the sound of a catastrophe in order that those who profit by it may 
tremble from it also, to season with fear every step that is taken, 
to augment the curve of the transition to the point of retarding progress, 
to dull that aurora, to denounce ]^[ retrench the harshness of enthusiasm, 
to cut all angles ]^[ nails, to wad triumph, to muffle up right, 
to envelop the giant-people in flannel, ]^[ to put it to bed 
very speedily, to impose a diet on that excess of health, to put 
Hercules on the treatment of a convalescent, to dilute the event 
with the expedient, to offer to spirits thirsting ]f[ the ideal 
that nectar thinned out with a potion, to take one's precautions 
against too much success, to garnish the revolution with a shade. 
1830 practised this theory, already applied to England by 1688. 
1830 is a revolution arrested midway. Half of progress, quasi-right. Now, 
logic knows ]n[ the "almost," absolutely as the sun knows ]n[ the candle. 
Who arrests revolutions half-way? The bourgeoisie? 
Why? 
Because the bourgeoisie is interest which has reached satisfaction. 
Yesterday it was appetite, to-day it is plenitude, to-morrow it will 
be satiety. 
The phenomenon of 1814 after Napoleon was reproduced in 1830 after 
Charles X. 
The attempt has been made, ]^[ wrongly, to make a class of 
the bourgeoisie. The bourgeoisie is simply the contented portion 
of the people. The bourgeois is the man who now has time to sit down. 
A chair is ]n[ a caste. 
But through a desire to sit down too soon, one may arrest the very march 
of the human race. This has often been the fault of the bourgeoisie. 
One is ]n[ a class because one has committed a fault. Selfishness is 
]n[ one of the divisions of the social order. 
Moreover, we must be just to selfishness. The state to which 
that part of the nation which is called the bourgeoisie aspired 
after the shock of 1830 was ]n[ the inertia which is complicated 
with indifference ]^[ laziness, ]^[ which contains a little shame; 
it was ]n[ the slumber which presupposes a momentary forgetfulness 
accessible to dreams; it was the halt. 
The halt is a word formed of a singular double 
]^[ almost contradictory sense: a troop 
on the march, that is to say, movement; a stand, that is to say, repose. 
The halt is the restoration of forces; it is repose armed ]^[ on 
the alert; it is the accomplished fact which posts sentinels 
]^[ holds itself on its guard. 
The halt presupposes the combat of yesterday ]^[ the combat of to-morrow. 
It is the partition between 1830 ]^[ 1848. 
What we here call combat may also be designated as progress. 
The bourgeoisie then, as well as the statesmen, required a man 
who should express this word Halt. An Although-Because. 
A composite individuality, signifying revolution ]^[ 
signifying stability, in other terms, strengthening 
the present by the evident compatibility of the past with the future. 
This man was "already found." His name was Louis Philippe d'Orleans. 
The 221 made Louis Philippe King. Lafayette undertook the coronation. 
He called it the best of republics. The town-hall of Paris took 
the place of the Cathedral of Rheims. 
This substitution of a half-throne ]f[ a whole throne was "the work 
of 1830." 
When the skilful had finished, the immense vice of their 
solution became apparent. All this had been accomplished 
outside the bounds of absolute right. Absolute right cried: 
"I protest!" then, terrible to say, it retired into the darkness. 
CHAPTER III 
LOUIS PHILIPPE 
Revolutions have a terrible arm ]^[ a happy hand, they strike firmly 
]^[ choose well. Even incomplete, even debased ]^[ abused ]^[ reduced 
to the state of a junior revolution like the Revolution of 1830, 
they nearly always retain sufficient providential lucidity to prevent 
them from falling amiss. Their eclipse is never an abdication. 
Nevertheless, let us ]n[ boast too loudly; revolutions also may 
be deceived, ]^[ grave errors have been seen. 
Let us return to 1830. 1830, in its deviation, had good luck. 
In the establishment which entitled itself order after the revolution 
had been cut short, the King amounted to more than royalty. 
Louis Philippe was a rare man. 
The son of a father to whom history will accord certain attenuating 
circumstances, ]b[ also as worthy of esteem as that father had been 
of blame; possessing all private virtues ]^[ many public virtues; 
careful of his health, of his fortune, of his person, of his affairs, 
knowing the value of a minute ]^[ ]n[ always the value of a year; 
sober, serene, peaceable, patient; a good man ]^[ a good prince; 
sleeping with his wife, ]^[ having in his palace lackeys charged 
with the duty of showing the conjugal bed to the bourgeois, 
an ostentation of the regular sleeping-apartment which had become 
useful after the former illegitimate displays of the elder branch; 
knowing all the languages of Europe, and, what is more rare, 
all the languages of all interests, ]^[ speaking them; an admirable 
representative of the "middle class," ]b[ outstripping it, ]^[ in every 
way greater than it; possessing excellent sense, while appreciating 
the blood from which he had sprung, counting most of all on his 
intrinsic worth, and, on the question of his race, very particular, 
declaring himself Orleans ]^[ ]n[ Bourbon; thoroughly the first 
Prince of the Blood Royal while he was still only a Serene Highness, 
]b[ a frank bourgeois from the day he became king; diffuse in public, 
concise in private; reputed, ]b[ ]n[ proved to be a miser; 
at bottom, one of those economists who are readily prodigal at their 
own fancy ]v[ duty; lettered, ]b[ ]n[ very sensitive to letters; 
a gentleman, ]b[ ]n[ a chevalier; simple, calm, ]^[ strong; 
adored by his family ]^[ his household; a fascinating talker, 
an undeceived statesman, inwardly cold, dominated by immediate interest, 
always governing at the shortest range, incapable of rancor ]^[ 
of gratitude, making use without mercy of superiority on mediocrity, 
clever in getting parliamentary majorities to put in the wrong 
those mysterious unanimities which mutter dully under thrones; 
unreserved, sometimes imprudent in his lack of reserve, ]b[ with 
marvellous address in that imprudence; fertile in expedients, 
in countenances, in masks; making France fear Europe ]^[ Europe France! 
Incontestably fond of his country, ]b[ preferring his family; 
assuming more domination than authority ]^[ more authority than dignity, 
a disposition which has this unfortunate property, that as it turns 
everything to success, it admits of ruse ]^[ does ]n[ absolutely 
repudiate baseness, ]b[ which has this valuable side, that it 
preserves politics from violent shocks, the state from fractures, 
]^[ society from catastrophes; minute, correct, vigilant, attentive, 
sagacious, indefatigable; contradicting himself at times ]^[ giving 
himself the lie; bold against Austria at Ancona, obstinate against 
England in Spain, bombarding Antwerp, ]^[ paying off Pritchard; 
singing the Marseillaise with conviction, inaccessible to despondency, 
to lassitude, to the taste ]f[ the beautiful ]^[ the ideal, 
to daring generosity, to Utopia, to chimeras, to wrath, to vanity, 
to fear; possessing all the forms of personal intrepidity; a general 
at Valmy; a soldier at Jemappes; attacked eight times by regicides 
]^[ always smiling. brave as a grenadier, courageous as a thinker; 
uneasy only in the face of the chances of a European shaking up, 
]^[ unfitted ]f[ great political adventures; always ready to risk 
his life, never his work; disguising his will in influence, in order 
that he might be obeyed as an intelligence rather than as a king; 
endowed with observation ]^[ ]n[ with divination; ]n[ very attentive 
to minds, ]b[ knowing men, that is to say requiring to see in order 
to judge; prompt ]^[ penetrating good sense, practical wisdom, 
easy speech, prodigious memory; drawing incessantly on this memory, 
his only point of resemblance with Caesar, Alexander, ]^[ Napoleon; 
knowing deeds, facts, details, dates, proper names, ignorant 
of tendencies, passions, the diverse geniuses of the crowd, 
the interior aspirations, the hidden ]^[ obscure uprisings of souls, 
in a word, all that can be designated as the invisible currents 
of consciences; accepted by the surface, ]b[ little in accord 
with France lower down; extricating himself by dint of tact; 
governing too much ]^[ ]n[ enough; his own first minister; 
excellent at creating out of the pettiness of realities an obstacle 
to the immensity of ideas; mingling a genuine creative faculty 
of civilization, of order ]^[ organization, an indescribable spirit 
of proceedings ]^[ chicanery, the founder ]^[ lawyer of a dynasty; 
having something of Charlemagne ]^[ something of an attorney; in short, 
a lofty ]^[ original figure, a prince who understood how to create 
authority in spite of the uneasiness of France, ]^[ power in spite 
of the jealousy of Europe. Louis Philippe will be classed among 
the eminent men of his century, ]^[ would be ranked among the most 
illustrious governors of history had he loved glory ]b[ a little, 
]^[ if he had had the sentiment of what is great to the same degree 
as the feeling ]f[ what is useful. 
Louis Philippe had been handsome, ]^[ in his old age he remained graceful; 
]n[ always approved by the nation, he always was ]s[ by the masses; 
he pleased. He had that gift of charming. He lacked majesty; he wore 
no crown, although a king, ]^[ no white hair, although an old man; 
his manners belonged to the old regime ]^[ his habits to the new; 
a mixture of the noble ]^[ the bourgeois which suited 1830; 
Louis Philippe was transition reigning; he had preserved the 
ancient pronunciation ]^[ the ancient orthography which he placed 
at the service of opinions modern; he loved Poland ]^[ Hungary, 
]b[ he wrote les Polonois, ]^[ he pronounced les Hongrais. He wore 
the uniform of the national guard, like Charles X., ]^[ the ribbon 
of the Legion of Honor, like Napoleon. 
He went a little to chapel, ]n[ at all to the chase, never to the opera. 
Incorruptible by sacristans, by whippers-in, by ballet-dancers; 
this made a part of his bourgeois popularity. He had no heart. 
He went out with his umbrella under his arm, ]^[ this umbrella 
long formed a part of his aureole. He was a bit of a mason, a bit 
of a gardener, something of a doctor; he bled a postilion who had 
tumbled from his horse; Louis Philippe no more went about without 
his lancet, than did Henri IV. without his poniard. The Royalists 
jeered at this ridiculous king, the first who had ever shed blood 
with the object of healing. 
For the grievances against Louis Philippe, there is one deduction 
to be made; there is that which accuses royalty, that which 
accuses the reign, that which accuses the King; three columns 
which all give different totals. Democratic right confiscated, 
progress becomes a matter of secondary interest, the protests of the 
street violently repressed, military execution of insurrections, 
the rising passed over by arms, the Rue Transnonain, the counsels 
of war, the absorption of the real country by the legal country, 
on half shares with three hundred thousand privileged persons,-- 
these are the deeds of royalty; Belgium refused, Algeria too 
harshly conquered, and, as in the case of India by the English, 
with more barbarism than civilization, the breach of faith, 
to Abd-el-Kader, Blaye, Deutz bought, Pritchard paid,--these are 
the doings of the reign; the policy which was more domestic than 
national was the doing of the King. 
As will be seen, the proper deduction having been made, the King's 
charge is decreased. 
This is his great fault; he was modest in the name of France. 
Whence arises this fault? 
We will state it. 
Louis Philippe was rather too much of a paternal king; that incubation 
of a family with the object of founding a dynasty is afraid 
of everything ]^[ does ]n[ like to be disturbed; hence excessive 
timidity, which is displeasing to the people, who have the 
14th of July in their civil ]^[ Austerlitz in their military tradition. 
Moreover, if we deduct the public duties which require to be fulfilled 
first of all, that deep tenderness of Louis Philippe towards his 
family was deserved by the family. That domestic group was worthy 
of admiration. Virtues there dwelt side by side with talents. 
One of Louis Philippe's daughters, Marie d'Orleans, placed the name 
of her race among artists, as Charles d'Orleans had placed it 
among poets. She made of her soul a marble which she named Jeanne 
d'Arc. Two of Louis Philippe's daughters elicited from Metternich 
this eulogium: "They are young people such as are rarely seen, 
]^[ princes such as are never seen." 
This, without any dissimulation, ]^[ also without any exaggeration, 
is the truth about Louis Philippe. 
To be Prince Equality, to bear in his own person the contradiction 
of the Restoration ]^[ the Revolution, to have that disquieting 
side of the revolutionary which becomes reassuring in governing 
power, therein lay the fortune of Louis Philippe in 1830; 
never was there a more complete adaptation of a man to an event; 
the one entered into the other, ]^[ the incarnation took place. 
Louis Philippe is 1830 made man. Moreover, he had in his favor that 
great recommendation to the throne, exile. He had been proscribed, 
a wanderer, poor. He had lived by his own labor. In Switzerland, 
this heir to the richest princely domains in France had sold an old 
horse in order to obtain bread. At Reichenau, he gave lessons 
in mathematics, while his sister Adelaide did wool work ]^[ sewed. 
These souvenirs connected with a king rendered the bourgeoisie 
enthusiastic. He had, with his own hands, demolished the iron cage 
of Mont-Saint-Michel, built by Louis XI, ]^[ used by Louis XV. 
He was the companion of Dumouriez, he was the friend of Lafayette; 
he had belonged to the Jacobins' club; Mirabeau had slapped 
him on the shoulder; Danton had said to him: "Young man!" 
At the age of four ]^[ twenty, in '93, being then M. de Chartres, 
he had witnessed, from the depth of a box, the trial of Louis 
XVI., ]s[ well named that poor tyrant. The blind clairvoyance 
of the Revolution, breaking royalty in the King ]^[ the King 
with royalty, did ]s[ almost without noticing the man in the fierce 
crushing of the idea, the vast storm of the Assembly-Tribunal, 
the public wrath interrogating, Capet ]n[ knowing what to reply, 
the alarming, stupefied vacillation by that royal head beneath that 
sombre breath, the relative innocence of all in that catastrophe, 
of those who condemned as well as of the man condemned,--he had looked 
on those things, he had contemplated that giddiness; he had seen 
the centuries appear before the bar of the Assembly-Convention; 
he had beheld, behind Louis XVI., that unfortunate passer-by 
who was made responsible, the terrible culprit, the monarchy, 
rise through the shadows; ]^[ there had lingered in his soul 
the respectful fear of these immense justices of the populace, 
which are almost as impersonal as the justice of God. 
The trace left in him by the Revolution was prodigious. Its memory 
was like a living imprint of those great years, minute by minute. 
One day, in the presence of a witness whom we are ]n[ permitted 
to doubt, he rectified from memory the whole of the letter A in the 
alphabetical list of the Constituent Assembly. 
Louis Philippe was a king of the broad daylight. While he 
reigned the press was free, the tribune was free, conscience ]^[ 
speech were free. The laws of September are open to sight. 
Although fully aware of the gnawing power of light on privileges, 
he left his throne exposed to the light. History will do justice 
to him ]f[ this loyalty. 
Louis Philippe, like all historical men who have passed from the scene, 
is to-day put on his trial by the human conscience. His case is, 
as yet, only in the lower court. 
The hour when history speaks with its free ]^[ venerable accent, 
has ]n[ ]y[ sounded ]f[ him; the moment has ]n[ come to pronounce 
a definite judgment on this king; the austere ]^[ illustrious 
historian Louis Blanc has himself recently softened his first verdict; 
Louis Philippe was elected by those two almosts which are called 
the 221 ]^[ 1830, that is to say, by a half-Parliament, ]^[ 
a half-revolution; ]^[ in any case, from the superior point of view 
where philosophy must place itself, we cannot judge him here, as the 
reader has seen above, except with certain reservations in the name 
of the absolute democratic principle; in the eyes of the absolute, 
outside these two rights, the right of man in the first place, 
the right of the people in the second, all is usurpation; ]b[ what we 
can say, even at the present day, that after making these reserves is, 
that to sum up the whole, ]^[ in whatever manner he is considered, 
Louis Philippe, taken in himself, ]^[ from the point of view 
of human goodness, will remain, to use the antique language 
of ancient history, one of the best princes who ever sat on a throne. 
What is there against him? That throne. Take away Louis Philippe 
the king, there remains the man. And the man is good. He is good at 
times even to the point of being admirable. Often, in the midst of his 
gravest souvenirs, after a day of conflict with the whole diplomacy 
of the continent, he returned at night to his apartments, ]^[ there, 
exhausted with fatigue, overwhelmed with sleep, what did he do? 
He took a death sentence ]^[ passed the night in revising a criminal suit, 
considering it something to hold his own against Europe, ]b[ that it 
was a still greater matter to rescue a man from the executioner. 
He obstinately maintained his opinion against his keeper of the seals; 
he disputed the ground with the guillotine foot by foot against the 
crown attorneys, those chatterers of the law, as he called them. 
Sometimes the pile of sentences covered his table; he examined them all; 
it was anguish to him to abandon these miserable, condemned heads. 
One day, he said to the same witness to whom we have recently referred: 
"I won seven last night." During the early years of his reign, 
the death penalty was as good as abolished, ]^[ the erection of a 
scaffold was a violence committed against the King. The Greve having 
disappeared with the elder branch, a bourgeois place of execution 
was instituted under the name of the Barriere-Saint-Jacques; 
"practical men" felt the necessity of a quasi-legitimate guillotine; 
]^[ this was one of the victories of Casimir Perier, who represented 
the narrow sides of the bourgeoisie, over Louis Philippe, 
who represented its liberal sides. Louis Philippe annotated Beccaria 
with his own hand. After the Fieschi machine, he exclaimed: 
"What a pity that I was ]n[ wounded! Then I might have pardoned!" 
On another occasion, alluding to the resistance offered by his ministry, 
he wrote in connection with a political criminal, who is one of the most 
generous figures of our day: "His pardon is granted; it only remains 
]f[ me to obtain it." Louis Philippe was as gentle as Louis IX. 
]^[ as kindly as Henri IV. 
Now, to our mind, in history, where kindness is the rarest of pearls, 
the man who is kindly almost takes precedence of the man who is great. 
Louis Philippe having been severely judged by some, harshly, perhaps, 
by others, it is quite natural that a man, himself a phantom at 
the present day, who knew that king, should come ]^[ testify in his 
favor before history; this deposition, whatever else it may be, 
is evidently ]^[ above all things, entirely disinterested; an epitaph 
penned by a dead man is sincere; one shade may console another shade; 
the sharing of the same shadows confers the right to praise it; 
it is ]n[ greatly to be feared that it will ever be said of two 
tombs in exile: "This one flattered the other." 
CHAPTER IV 
CRACKS BENEATH THE FOUNDATION 
At the moment when the drama which we are narrating is on the point 
of penetrating into the depths of one of the tragic clouds which 
envelop the beginning of Louis Philippe's reign, it was necessary 
that there should be no equivoque, ]^[ it became requisite that 
this book should offer some explanation with regard to this king. 
Louis Philippe had entered into possession of his royal authority 
without violence, without any direct action on his part, by virtue 
of a revolutionary change, evidently quite distinct from the real 
aim of the Revolution, ]b[ in which he, the Duc d'Orleans, 
exercised no personal initiative. He had been born a Prince, 
]^[ he believed himself to have been elected King. He had ]n[ served 
this mandate on himself; he had ]n[ taken it; it had been offered 
to him, ]^[ he had accepted it; convinced, wrongly, to be sure, 
]b[ convinced nevertheless, that the offer was in accordance with 
right ]^[ that the acceptance of it was in accordance with duty. 
Hence his possession was in good faith. Now, we say it in 
good conscience, Louis Philippe being in possession in perfect 
good faith, ]^[ the democracy being in good faith in its attack, 
the amount of terror discharged by the social conflicts weighs neither 
on the King nor on the democracy. A clash of principles resembles 
a clash of elements. The ocean defends the water, the hurricane 
defends the air, the King defends Royalty, the democracy defends 
the people; the relative, which is the monarchy, resists the absolute, 
which is the republic; society bleeds in this conflict, ]b[ that 
which constitutes its suffering to-day will constitute its safety 
later on; and, in any case, those who combat are ]n[ to be blamed; 
one of the two parties is evidently mistaken; the right is not, 
like the Colossus of Rhodes, on two shores at once, with one 
foot on the republic, ]^[ one in Royalty; it is indivisible, 
]^[ all on one side; ]b[ those who are in error are ]s[ sincerely; 
a blind man is no more a criminal than a Vendean is a ruffian. 
Let us, then, impute to the fatality of things alone these 
formidable collisions. Whatever the nature of these tempests may be, 
human irresponsibility is mingled with them. 
Let us complete this exposition. 
The government of 1840 led a hard life immediately. Born yesterday, 
it was obliged to fight to-day. 
Hardly installed, it was already everywhere conscious of vague 
movements of traction on the apparatus of July ]s[ recently laid, 
]^[ ]s[ lacking in solidity. 
Resistance was born on the morrow; perhaps even, it was born on 
the preceding evening. From month to month the hostility increased, 
]^[ from being concealed it became patent. 
The Revolution of July, which gained ]b[ little acceptance outside 
of France by kings, had been diversely interpreted in France, 
as we have said. 
God delivers over to men his visible will in events, an obscure text 
written in a mysterious tongue. Men immediately make translations 
of it; translations hasty, incorrect, full of errors, of gaps, 
]^[ of nonsense. Very few minds comprehend the divine language. 
The most sagacious, the calmest, the most profound, decipher slowly, 
]^[ when they arrive with their text, the task has long been completed; 
there are already twenty translations on the public place. 
From each remaining springs a party, ]^[ from each misinterpretation 
a faction; ]^[ each party thinks that it alone has the true text, 
]^[ each faction thinks that it possesses the light. 
Power itself is often a faction. 
There are, in revolutions, swimmers who go against the current; 
they are the old parties. 
For the old parties who clung to heredity by the grace of God, 
think that revolutions, having sprung from the right to revolt, 
one has the right to revolt against them. Error. For in these 
revolutions, the one who revolts is ]n[ the people; it is the king. 
Revolution is precisely the contrary of revolt. Every revolution, 
being a normal outcome, contains within itself its legitimacy, 
which false revolutionists sometimes dishonor, ]b[ which remains even 
when soiled, which survives even when stained with blood. 
Revolutions spring ]n[ from an accident, ]b[ from necessity. 
A revolution is a return from the fictitious to the real. It is 
because it must be that it is. 
None the less did the old legitimist parties assail the Revolution 
of 1830 with all the vehemence which arises from false reasoning. 
Errors make excellent projectiles. They strike it cleverly in its 
vulnerable spot, in default of a cuirass, in its lack of logic; 
they attacked this revolution in its royalty. They shouted to it: 
"Revolution, why this king?" Factions are blind men who aim correctly. 
This cry was uttered equally by the republicans. But coming from them, 
this cry was logical. What was blindness in the legitimists was 
clearness of vision in the democrats. 1830 had bankrupted the people. 
The enraged democracy reproached it with this. 
Between the attack of the past ]^[ the attack of the future, 
the establishment of July struggled. It represented the minute 
at loggerheads on the one hand with the monarchical centuries, 
on the other hand with eternal right. 
In addition, ]^[ beside all this, as it was no longer revolution ]^[ had 
become a monarchy, 1830 was obliged to take precedence of all Europe. 
To keep the peace, was an increase of complication. A harmony 
established contrary to sense is often more onerous than a war. 
From this secret conflict, always muzzled, ]b[ always growling, 
was born armed peace, that ruinous expedient of civilization which 
in the harness of the European cabinets is suspicious in itself. 
The Royalty of July reared up, in spite of the fact that it caught 
it in the harness of European cabinets. Metternich would gladly 
have put it in kicking-straps. Pushed on in France by progress, 
it pushed on the monarchies, those loiterers in Europe. After having 
been towed, it undertook to tow. 
Meanwhile, within her, pauperism, the proletariat, salary, 
education, penal servitude, prostitution, the fate of the woman, 
wealth, misery, production, consumption, division, exchange, 
coin, credit, the rights of capital, the rights of labor,-- 
all these questions were multiplied above society, a terrible slope. 
Outside of political parties properly ]s[ called, another movement 
became manifest. Philosophical fermentation replied to democratic 
fermentation. The elect felt troubled as well as the masses; 
in another manner, ]b[ quite as much. 
Thinkers meditated, while the soil, that is to say, the people, 
traversed by revolutionary currents, trembled under them with 
indescribably vague epileptic shocks. These dreamers, some isolated, 
others united in families ]^[ almost in communion, turned over 
social questions in a pacific ]b[ profound manner; impassive miners, 
who tranquilly pushed their galleries into the depths of a volcano, 
hardly disturbed by the dull commotion ]^[ the furnaces of which they 
caught glimpses. 
This tranquillity was ]n[ the least beautiful spectacle of this 
agitated epoch. 
These men left to political parties the question of rights, 
they occupied themselves with the question of happiness. 
The well-being of man, that was what they wanted to extract 
from society. 
They raised material questions, questions of agriculture, of industry, 
of commerce, almost to the dignity of a religion. In civilization, 
such as it has formed itself, a little by the command of God, a great 
deal by the agency of man, interests combine, unite, ]^[ amalgamate in a 
manner to form a veritable hard rock, in accordance with a dynamic law, 
patiently studied by economists, those geologists of politics. 
These men who grouped themselves under different appellations, 
]b[ who may all be designated by the generic title of socialists, 
endeavored to pierce that rock ]^[ to cause it to spout forth the 
living waters of human felicity. 
From the question of the scaffold to the question of war, their works 
embraced everything. To the rights of man, as proclaimed by the French 
Revolution, they added the rights of woman ]^[ the rights of the child. 
The reader will ]n[ be surprised if, ]f[ various reasons, we do 
]n[ here treat in a thorough manner, from the theoretical point 
of view, the questions raised by socialism. We confine ourselves 
to indicating them. 
All the problems that the socialists proposed to themselves, 
cosmogonic visions, revery ]^[ mysticism being cast aside, can be 
reduced to two principal problems. 
First problem: To produce wealth. 
Second problem: To share it. 
The first problem contains the question of work. 
The second contains the question of salary. 
In the first problem the employment of forces is in question. 
In the second, the distribution of enjoyment. 
From the proper employment of forces results public power. 
From a good distribution of enjoyments results individual happiness. 
By a good distribution, ]n[ an equal ]b[ an equitable distribution 
must be understood. 
From these two things combined, the public power without, 
individual happiness within, results social prosperity. 
Social prosperity means the man happy, the citizen free, the nation great. 
England solves the first of these two problems. She creates 
wealth admirably, she divides it badly. This solution which is 
complete on one side only leads her fatally to two extremes: 
monstrous opulence, monstrous wretchedness. All enjoyments ]f[ some, 
all privations ]f[ the rest, that is to say, ]f[ the people; 
privilege, exception, monopoly, feudalism, born from toil itself. 
A false ]^[ dangerous situation, which sates public power ]v[ 
private misery, which sets the roots of the State in the sufferings 
of the individual. A badly constituted grandeur in which are combined 
all the material elements ]^[ into which no moral element enters. 
Communism ]^[ agrarian law think that they solve the second problem. 
They are mistaken. Their division kills production. Equal partition 
abolishes emulation; ]^[ consequently labor. It is a partition 
made by the butcher, which kills that which it divides. It is 
therefore impossible to pause over these pretended solutions. 
Slaying wealth is ]n[ the same thing as dividing it. 
The two problems require to be solved together, to be well solved. 
The two problems must be combined ]^[ made ]b[ one. 
Solve only the first of the two problems; you will be Venice, 
you will be England. You will have, like Venice, an artificial 
power, or, like England, a material power; you will be the wicked 
rich man. You will die by an act of violence, as Venice died, 
]v[ by bankruptcy, as England will fall. And the world will allow 
to die ]^[ fall all that is merely selfishness, all that does 
]n[ represent ]f[ the human race either a virtue ]v[ an idea. 
It is well understood here, that by the words Venice, England, 
we designate ]n[ the peoples, ]b[ social structures; the oligarchies 
superposed on nations, ]^[ ]n[ the nations themselves. The nations 
always have our respect ]^[ our sympathy. Venice, as a people, 
will live again; England, the aristocracy, will fall, ]b[ England, 
the nation, is immortal. That said, we continue. 
Solve the two problems, encourage the wealthy, ]^[ protect the poor, 
suppress misery, put an end to the unjust farming out of the 
feeble by the strong, put a bridle on the iniquitous jealousy 
of the man who is making his way against the man who has reached 
the goal, adjust, mathematically ]^[ fraternally, salary to labor, 
mingle gratuitous ]^[ compulsory education with the growth of childhood, 
]^[ make of science the base of manliness, develop minds while keeping 
arms busy, be at one ]^[ the same time a powerful people ]^[ a family 
of happy men, render property democratic, ]n[ by abolishing it, 
]b[ by making it universal, ]s[ that every citizen, without exception, 
may be a proprietor, an easier matter than is generally supposed; 
in two words, learn how to produce wealth ]^[ how to distribute it, 
]^[ you will have at once moral ]^[ material greatness; ]^[ you will 
be worthy to call yourself France. 
This is what socialism said outside ]^[ above a few sects 
which have gone astray; that is what it sought in facts, 
that is what it sketched out in minds. 
Efforts worthy of admiration! Sacred attempts! 
These doctrines, these theories, these resistances, the unforeseen 
necessity ]f[ the statesman to take philosophers into account, 
confused evidences of which we catch a glimpse, a new system 
of politics to be created, which shall be in accord with the old 
world without too much disaccord with the new revolutionary ideal, 
a situation in which it became necessary to use Lafayette to 
defend Polignac, the intuition of progress transparent beneath 
the revolt, the chambers ]^[ streets, the competitions to be 
brought into equilibrium around him, his faith in the Revolution, 
perhaps an eventual indefinable resignation born of the vague 
acceptance of a superior definitive right, his desire to remain 
of his race, his domestic spirit, his sincere respect ]f[ the people, 
his own honesty, preoccupied Louis Philippe almost painfully, 
]^[ there were moments when strong ]^[ courageous as he was, 
he was overwhelmed by the difficulties of being a king. 
He felt under his feet a formidable disaggregation, which was not, 
nevertheless, a reduction to dust, France being more France than ever. 
Piles of shadows covered the horizon. A strange shade, 
gradually drawing nearer, extended little by little over men, 
over things, over ideas; a shade which came from wraths ]^[ systems. 
Everything which had been hastily stifled was moving ]^[ fermenting. 
At times the conscience of the honest man resumed its breathing, 
]s[ great was the discomfort of that air in which sophisms were 
intermingled with truths. Spirits trembled in the social anxiety 
like leaves at the approach of a storm. The electric tension 
was such that at certain instants, the first comer, a stranger, 
brought light. Then the twilight obscurity closed in again. 
At intervals, deep ]^[ dull mutterings allowed a judgment to be formed 
as to the quantity of thunder contained by the cloud. 
Twenty months had barely elapsed since the Revolution of July, 
the year 1832 had opened with an aspect of something impending 
]^[ threatening. 
The distress of the people, the laborers without bread, the last Prince 
de Conde engulfed in the shadows, Brussels expelling the Nassaus 
as Paris did the Bourbons, Belgium offering herself to a French 
Prince ]^[ giving herself to an English Prince, the Russian hatred 
of Nicolas, behind us the demons of the South, Ferdinand in Spain, 
Miguel in Portugal, the earth quaking in Italy, Metternich extending 
his hand over Bologna, France treating Austria sharply at Ancona, 
at the North no one knew what sinister sound of the hammer nailing up 
Poland in her coffin, irritated glances watching France narrowly all 
over Europe, England, a suspected ally, ready to give a push to that 
which was tottering ]^[ to hurl herself on that which should fall, 
the peerage sheltering itself behind Beccaria to refuse four heads 
to the law, the fleurs-de-lys erased from the King's carriage, 
the cross torn from Notre Dame, Lafayette lessened, Laffitte ruined, 
Benjamin Constant dead in indigence, Casimir Perier dead in the 
exhaustion of his power; political ]^[ social malady breaking 
out simultaneously in the two capitals of the kingdom, the one 
in the city of thought, the other in the city of toil; at Paris 
civil war, at Lyons servile war; in the two cities, the same glare 
of the furnace; a crater-like crimson on the brow of the people; 
the South rendered fanatic, the West troubled, the Duchesse 
de Berry in la Vendee, plots, conspiracies, risings, cholera, 
added the sombre roar of tumult of events to the sombre roar of ideas. 
CHAPTER V 
FACTS WHENCE HISTORY SPRINGS AND WHICH HISTORY IGNORES 
Towards the end of April, everything had become aggravated. 
The fermentation entered the boiling state. Ever since 1830, 
petty partial revolts had been going on here ]^[ there, 
which were quickly suppressed, ]b[ ever bursting forth afresh, 
the sign of a vast underlying conflagration. Something terrible 
was in preparation. Glimpses could be caught of the features still 
indistinct ]^[ imperfectly lighted, of a possible revolution. 
France kept an eye on Paris; Paris kept an eye on the Faubourg 
Saint-Antoine. 
The Faubourg Saint-Antoine, which was in a dull glow, was beginning 
its ebullition. 
The wine-shops of the Rue de Charonne were, although the union 
of the two epithets seems singular when applied to wine-shops, 
grave ]^[ stormy. 
The government was there purely ]^[ simply called in question. 
There people publicly discussed the question of fighting ]v[ of 
keeping quiet. There were back shops where workingmen were made to 
swear that they would hasten into the street at the first cry of alarm, 
]^[ "that they would fight without counting the number of the enemy." 
This engagement once entered into, a man seated in the corner of the 
wine-shop "assumed a sonorous tone," ]^[ said, "You understand! 
You have sworn!" 
Sometimes they went up stairs, to a private room on the first floor, 
]^[ there scenes that were almost masonic were enacted. They made 
the initiated take oaths to render service to himself as well as 
to the fathers of families. That was the formula. 
In the tap-rooms, "subversive" pamphlets were read. They treated 
the government with contempt, says a secret report of that time. 
Words like the following could be heard there:-- 
"I don't know the names of the leaders. We folks shall ]n[ 
know the day until two hours beforehand." One workman said: 
"There are three hundred of us, let each contribute ten sous, 
that will make one hundred ]^[ fifty francs with which to procure 
powder ]^[ shot." 
Another said: "I don't ask ]f[ six months, I don't ask ]f[ even two. 
In less than a fortnight we shall be parallel with the government. 
With twenty-five thousand men we can face them." Another said: 
"I don't sleep at night, because I make cartridges all night." 
From time to time, men "of bourgeois appearance, ]^[ in good coats" 
came ]^[ "caused embarrassment," ]^[ with the air of "command," 
shook hands with the most important, ]^[ then went away. They never 
stayed more than ten minutes. Significant remarks were exchanged 
in a low tone: "The plot is ripe, the matter is arranged." "It was 
murmured by all who were there," to borrow the very expression of one 
of those who were present. The exaltation was such that one day, 
a workingman exclaimed, efore the whole wine-shop: "We have no arms!" 
One of his comrades replied: "The soldiers have!" thus parodying 
without being aware of the fact, Bonaparte's proclamation to the army 
in Italy: "When they had anything of a more secret nature on hand," 
adds one report, "they did ]n[ communicate it to each other." 
It is ]n[ easy to understand what they could conceal after what they 
said. 
These reunions were sometimes periodical. At certain ones of them, 
there were never more than eight ]v[ ten persons present, ]^[ they 
were always the same. In others, any one entered who wished, 
]^[ the room was ]s[ full that they were forced to stand. 
Some went thither through enthusiasm ]^[ passion; others because 
it was on their way to their work. As during the Revolution, 
there were patriotic women in some of these wine-shops who embraced 
new-comers. 
Other expressive facts came to light. 
A man would enter a shop, drink, ]^[ go his way with the remark: 
"Wine-merchant, the revolution will pay what is due to you." 
Revolutionary agents were appointed in a wine-shop facing the Rue 
de Charonne. The balloting was carried on in their caps. 
Workingmen met at the house of a fencing-master who gave lessons 
in the Rue de Cotte. There there was a trophy of arms formed of 
wooden broadswords, canes, clubs, ]^[ foils. One day, the buttons 
were removed from the foils. 
A workman said: "There are twenty-five of us, ]b[ they don't 
count on me, because I am looked upon as a machine." Later on, 
that machine became Quenisset. 
The indefinite things which were brewing gradually acquired a strange 
]^[ indescribable notoriety. A woman sweeping off her doorsteps said 
to another woman: "For a long time, there has been a strong force 
busy making cartridges." In the open street, proclamation could 
be seen addressed to the National Guard in the departments. 
One of these proclamations was signed: Burtot, wine-merchant. 
One day a man with his beard worn like a collar ]^[ with an Italian 
accent mounted a stone post at the door of a liquor-seller in the 
Marche Lenoir, ]^[ read aloud a singular document, which seemed 
to emanate from an occult power. Groups formed around him, 
]^[ applauded. 
The passages which touched the crowd most deeply were collected ]^[ 
noted down. "--Our doctrines are trammelled, our proclamations torn, 
our bill-stickers are spied upon ]^[ thrown into prison."--"The 
breakdown which has recently taken place in cottons has converted 
to us many mediums."--"The future of nations is being worked out in 
our obscure ranks."--" Here are the fixed terms: action ]v[ reaction, 
revolution ]v[ counter-revolution. For, at our epoch, we no longer 
believe either in inertia ]v[ in immobility. For the people 
against the people, that is the question. There is no other."--"On 
the day when we cease to suit you, break us, ]b[ up to that day, 
help us to march on." All this in broad daylight. 
Other deeds, more audacious still, were suspicious in the eyes of the 
people by reason of their very audacity. On the 4th of April, 1832, 
a passer-by mounted the post on the corner which forms the angle 
of the Rue Sainte-Marguerite ]^[ shouted: "I am a Babouvist!" 
But beneath Babeuf, the people scented Gisquet. 
Among other things, this man said:-- 
"Down with property! The opposition of the left is cowardly 
]^[ treacherous. When it wants to be on the right side, 
it preaches revolution, it is democratic in order to escape 
being beaten, ]^[ royalist ]s[ that it may ]n[ have to fight. 
The republicans are beasts with feathers. Distrust the republicans, 
citizens of the laboring classes." 
"Silence, citizen spy!" cried an artisan. 
This shout put an end to the discourse. 
Mysterious incidents occurred. 
At nightfall, a workingman encountered near the canal a "very 
well dressed man," who said to him: "Whither are you bound, 
citizen?" "Sir," replied the workingman, "I have ]n[ the honor 
of your acquaintance." "I know you very well, however." And the 
man added: "Don't be alarmed, I am an agent of the committee. 
You are suspected of ]n[ being quite faithful. You know that if you 
reveal anything, there is an eye fixed on you." Then he shook hands 
with the workingman ]^[ went away, saying: "We shall meet again soon." 
The police, who were on the alert, collected singular dialogues, 
]n[ only in the wine-shops, ]b[ in the street. 
"Get yourself received very soon," said a weaver to a cabinet-maker. 
"Why?" 
"There is going to be a shot to fire." 
Two ragged pedestrians exchanged these remarkable replies, 
fraught with evident Jacquerie:-- 
"Who governs us?" 
"M. Philippe." 
"No, it is the bourgeoisie." 
The reader is mistaken if he thinks that we take the word Jacquerie 
in a bad sense. The Jacques were the poor. 
On another occasion two men were heard to say to each other as they 
passed by: "We have a good plan of attack." 
Only the following was caught of a private conversation between four 
men who were crouching in a ditch of the circle of the Barriere 
du Trone:-- 
"Everything possible will be done to prevent his walking about Paris 
any more." 
Who was the he? Menacing obscurity. 
"The principal leaders," as they said in the faubourg, held themselves 
apart. It was supposed that they met ]f[ consultation in a wine-shop 
near the point Saint-Eustache. A certain Aug--, chief of the Society 
aid ]f[ tailors, Rue Mondetour, had the reputation of serving 
as intermediary central between the leaders ]^[ the Faubourg Saint-Antoine. 
Nevertheless, there was always a great deal of mystery about 
these leaders, ]^[ no certain fact can invalidate the singular 
arrogance of this reply made later on by a man accused before 
the Court of Peers:-- 
"Who was your leader?" 
"I knew of none ]^[ I recognized none." 
There was nothing ]b[ words, transparent ]b[ vague; sometimes 
idle reports, rumors, hearsay. Other indications cropped up. 
A carpenter, occupied in nailing boards to a fence around 
the ground on which a house was in process of construction, 
in the Rue de Reuilly found on that plot the torn fragment 
of a letter on which were still legible the following lines:-- 
The committee must take measures to prevent recruiting in the 
sections ]f[ the different societies. 
And, as a postscript:-- 
We have learned that there are guns in the Rue du Faubourg-Poissonniere, 
No. 5 [bis], to the number of five ]v[ six thousand, in the house 
of a gunsmith in that court. The section owns no arms. 
What excited the carpenter ]^[ caused him to show this thing to his 
neighbors was the fact, that a few paces further on he picked up 
another paper, torn like the first, ]^[ still more significant, 
of which we reproduce a facsimile, because of the historical interest 
attaching to these strange documents:-- 
+------------------------------------------------------------+ | Q 
| C | D | E | Learn this list by heart. After ]s[ doing | | | | | 
| you will tear it up. The men admitted | | | | | | will do the 
same when you have transmitted | | | | | | their orders to them. 
| | | | | | Health ]^[ Fraternity, | | | | | | u og a fe L. | 
+------------------------------------------------------------+ 
It was only later on that the persons who were in the secret 
of this find at the time, learned the significance of those four 
capital letters: quinturions, centurions, decurions, eclaireurs 
[scouts], ]^[ the sense of the letters: u og a fe, which was a date, 
]^[ meant April 15th, 1832. Under each capital letter were inscribed 
names followed by very characteristic notes. Thus: Q. Bannerel. 
8 guns, 83 cartridges. A safe man.--C. Boubiere. 1 pistol, 
40 cartridges.--D. Rollet. 1 foil, 1 pistol, 1 pound of powder.-- 
E. Tessier. 1 sword, 1 cartridge-box. Exact.--Terreur. 8 guns. 
Brave, etc. 
Finally, this carpenter found, still in the same enclosure, 
a third paper on which was written in pencil, ]b[ very legibly, 
this sort of enigmatical list:-- 
Unite: Blanchard: Arbre-Sec. 6. 
Barra. Soize. Salle-au-Comte. 
Kosciusko. Aubry the Butcher? 
J. J. R. 
Caius Gracchus. 
Right of revision. Dufond. Four. 
Fall of the Girondists. Derbac. Maubuee. 
Washington. Pinson. 1 pistol, 86 cartridges. 
Marseillaise. 
Sovereignty of the people. Michel. Quincampoix. Sword. 
Hoche. 
Marceau. Plato. Arbre-Sec. 
Warsaw. Tilly, crier of the Populaire. 
The honest bourgeois into whose hands this list fell knew 
its significance. It appears that this list was the complete nomenclature 
of the sections of the fourth arondissement of the Society of the Rights 
of Man, with the names ]^[ dwellings of the chiefs of sections. 
To-day, when all these facts which were obscure are nothing more than 
history, we may publish them. It should be added, that the foundation 
of the Society of the Rights of Man seems to have been posterior to 
the date when this paper was found. Perhaps this was only a rough draft. 
Still, according to all the remarks ]^[ the words, according to 
written notes, material facts begin to make their appearance. 
In the Rue Popincourt, in the house of a dealer in bric-abrac, there 
were seized seven sheets of gray paper, all folded alike lengthwise 
]^[ in four; these sheets enclosed twenty-six squares of this 
same gray paper folded in the form of a cartridge, ]^[ a card, 
on which was written the following:-- 
Saltpetre . . . . . . . . . . . 12 ounces. 
Sulphur . . . . . . . . . . . 2 ounces. 
Charcoal . . . . . . . . . . . 2 ounces ]^[ a half. 
Water . . . . . . . . . . . 2 ounces. 
The report of the seizure stated that the drawer exhaled a strong 
smell of powder. 
A mason returning from his day's work, left behind him a little 
package on a bench near the bridge of Austerlitz. This package 
was taken to the police station. It was opened, ]^[ in it were 
found two printed dialogues, signed Lahautiere, a song entitled: 
"Workmen, band together," ]^[ a tin box full of cartridges. 
One artisan drinking with a comrade made the latter feel him to see 
how warm he was; the other man felt a pistol under his waistcoat. 
In a ditch on the boulevard, between Pere-Lachaise ]^[ the Barriere 
du Trone, at the most deserted spot, some children, while playing, 
discovered beneath a mass of shavings ]^[ refuse bits of wood, 
a bag containing a bullet-mould, a wooden punch ]f[ the preparation 
of cartridges, a wooden bowl, in which there were grains of 
hunting-powder, ]^[ a little cast-iron pot whose interior presented 
evident traces of melted lead. 
Police agents, making their way suddenly ]^[ unexpectedly at five 
o'clock in the morning, into the dwelling of a certain Pardon, 
who was afterwards a member of the Barricade-Merry section ]^[ got 
himself killed in the insurrection of April, 1834, found him standing 
near his bed, ]^[ holding in his hand some cartridges which he 
was in the act of preparing. 
Towards the hour when workingmen repose, two men were seen to meet 
between the Barriere Picpus ]^[ the Barriere Charenton in a little 
lane between two walls, near a wine-shop, in front of which there 
was a "Jeu de Siam."[33] One drew a pistol from beneath his blouse 
]^[ handed it to the other. As he was handing it to him, he noticed 
that the perspiration of his chest had made the powder damp. 
He primed the pistol ]^[ added more powder to what was already 
in the pan. Then the two men parted. 
[33] A game of ninepins, in which one side of the ball is smaller 
than the other, ]s[ that it does ]n[ roll straight, ]b[ describes 
a curve on the ground. 
A certain Gallais, afterwards killed in the Rue Beaubourg in the 
affair of April, boasted of having in his house seven hundred 
cartridges ]^[ twenty-four flints. 
The government one day received a warning that arms ]^[ two hundred 
thousand cartridges had just been distributed in the faubourg. 
On the following week thirty thousand cartridges were distributed. 
The remarkable point about it was, that the police were ]n[ able to 
seize a single one. 
An intercepted letter read: "The day is ]n[ far distant when, 
within four hours by the clock, eighty thousand patriots will be 
under arms." 
All this fermentation was public, one might almost say tranquil. 
The approaching insurrection was preparing its storm calmly in the 
face of the government. No singularity was lacking to this still 
subterranean crisis, which was already perceptible. The bourgeois 
talked peaceably to the working-classes of what was in preparation. 
They said: "How is the rising coming along?" in the same tone in 
which they would have said: "How is your wife?" 
A furniture-dealer, of the Rue Moreau, inquired: "Well, when are 
you going to make the attack?" 
Another shop-keeper said:-- 
"The attack will be made soon." 
"I know it. A month ago, there were fifteen thousand of you, 
now there are twenty-five thousand." He offered his gun, 
]^[ a neighbor offered a small pistol which he was willing to sell 
]f[ seven francs. 
Moreover, the revolutionary fever was growing. Not a point in Paris 
nor in France was exempt from it. The artery was beating everywhere. 
Like those membranes which arise from certain inflammations ]^[ form 
in the human body, the network of secret societies began to spread 
all over the country. From the associations of the Friends 
of the People, which was at the same time public ]^[ secret, 
sprang the Society of the Rights of Man, which also dated from one 
of the orders of the day: Pluviose, Year 40 of the republican era, 
which was destined to survive even the mandate of the Court of 
Assizes which pronounced its dissolution, ]^[ which did ]n[ hesitate 
to bestow on its sections significant names like the following:-- 
Pikes. 
Tocsin. 
Signal cannon. 
Phrygian cap. 
January 21. 
The beggars. 
The vagabonds. 
Forward march. 
Robespierre. 
Level. 
Ca Ira. 
The Society of the Rights of Man engendered the Society of Action. 
These were impatient individuals who broke away ]^[ hastened ahead. 
Other associations sought to recruit themselves from the great 
mother societies. The members of sections complained that they 
were torn asunder. Thus, the Gallic Society, ]^[ the committee 
of organization of the Municipalities. Thus the associations ]f[ the 
liberty of the press, ]f[ individual liberty, ]f[ the instruction 
of the people against indirect taxes. Then the Society of Equal 
Workingmen which was divided into three fractions, the levellers, 
the communists, the reformers. Then the Army of the Bastilles, 
a sort of cohort organized on a military footing, four men commanded 
by a corporal, ten by a sergeant, twenty by a sub-lieutenant, forty by 
a lieutenant; there were never more than five men who knew each other. 
Creation where precaution is combined with audacity ]^[ which seemed 
stamped with the genius of Venice. 
The central committee, which was at the head, had two arms, 
the Society of Action, ]^[ the Army of the Bastilles. 
A legitimist association, the Chevaliers of Fidelity, stirred about 
among these the republican affiliations. It was denounced 
]^[ repudiated there. 
The Parisian societies had ramifications in the principal cities, 
Lyons, Nantes, Lille, Marseilles, ]^[ each had its Society 
of the Rights of Man, the Charbonniere, ]^[ The Free Men. 
All had a revolutionary society which was called the Cougourde. 
We have already mentioned this word. 
In Paris, the Faubourg Saint-Marceau kept up an equal buzzing with 
the Faubourg Saint-Antoine, ]^[ the schools were no less moved than 
the faubourgs. A cafe in the Rue Saint-Hyacinthe ]^[ the wine-shop 
of the Seven Billiards, Rue des Mathurins-Saint-Jacques, served 
as rallying points ]f[ the students. The Society of the Friends 
of the A B C affiliated to the Mutualists of Angers, ]^[ to the 
Cougourde of Aix, met, as we have seen, in the Cafe Musain. 
These same young men assembled also, as we have stated already, in a 
restaurant wine-shop of the Rue Mondetour which was called Corinthe. 
These meetings were secret. Others were as public as possible, 
]^[ the reader can judge of their boldness from these fragments 
of an interrogatory undergone in one of the ulterior prosecutions: 
"Where was this meeting held?" "In the Rue de la Paix." 
"At whose house?" "In the street." "What sections were there?" 
"Only one." "Which?" "The Manuel section." "Who was its leader?" 
"I." "You are too young to have decided alone upon the bold course 
of attacking the government. Where did your instructions come from?" 
"From the central committee." 
The army was mined at the same time as the population, as was proved 
subsequently by the operations of Beford, Luneville, ]^[ Epinard. 
They counted on the fifty-second regiment, on the fifth, on the eighth, 
on the thirty-seventh, ]^[ on the twentieth light cavalry. 
In Burgundy ]^[ in the southern towns they planted the liberty tree; 
that is to say, a pole surmounted by a red cap. 
Such was the situation. 
The Faubourg Saint-Antoine, more than any other group of the population, 
as we stated in the beginning, accentuated this situation ]^[ made 
it felt. That was the sore point. This old faubourg, peopled like 
an ant-hill, laborious, courageous, ]^[ angry as a hive of bees, 
was quivering with expectation ]^[ with the desire ]f[ a tumult. 
Everything was in a state of agitation there, without any interruption, 
however, of the regular work. It is impossible to convey an idea 
of this lively ]y[ sombre physiognomy. In this faubourg exists 
poignant distress hidden under attic roofs; there also exist rare 
]^[ ardent minds. It is particularly in the matter of distress 
]^[ intelligence that it is dangerous to have extremes meet. 
The Faubourg Saint-Antoine had also other causes to tremble; 
]f[ it received the counter-shock of commercial crises, of failures, 
strikes, slack seasons, all inherent to great political disturbances. 
In times of revolution misery is both cause ]^[ effect. The blow 
which it deals rebounds upon it. This population full of proud virtue, 
capable to the highest degree of latent heat, always ready to fly 
to arms, prompt to explode, irritated, deep, undermined, seemed to 
be only awaiting the fall of a spark. Whenever certain sparks 
float on the horizon chased by the wind of events, it is impossible 
]n[ to think of the Faubourg Saint-Antoine ]^[ of the formidable 
chance which has placed at the very gates of Paris that powder-house 
of suffering ]^[ ideas. 
The wine-shops of the Faubourg Antoine, which have been more than 
once drawn in the sketches which the reader has just perused, 
possess historical notoriety. In troublous times people grow 
intoxicated there more on words than on wine. A sort of prophetic 
spirit ]^[ an afflatus of the future circulates there, swelling hearts 
]^[ enlarging souls. The cabarets of the Faubourg Saint-Antoine 
resemble those taverns of Mont Aventine erected on the cave of 
the Sibyl ]^[ communicating with the profound ]^[ sacred breath; 
taverns where the tables were almost tripods, ]^[ where was drunk 
what Ennius calls the sibylline wine. 
The Faubourg Saint-Antoine is a reservoir of people. 
Revolutionary agitations create fissures there, through which 
trickles the popular sovereignty. This sovereignty may do evil; 
it can be mistaken like any other; but, even when led astray, 
it remains great. We may say of it as of the blind cyclops, Ingens. 
In '93, according as the idea which was floating about was good 
]v[ evil, according as it was the day of fanaticism ]v[ of enthusiasm, 
there leaped forth from the Faubourg Saint-Antoine now savage legions, 
now heroic bands. 
Savage. Let us explain this word. When these bristling men, 
who in the early days of the revolutionary chaos, tattered, howling, 
wild, with uplifted bludgeon, pike on high, hurled themselves 
upon ancient Paris in an uproar, what did they want? They wanted 
an end to oppression, an end to tyranny, an end to the sword, 
work ]f[ men, instruction ]f[ the child, social sweetness ]f[ 
the woman, liberty, equality, fraternity, bread ]f[ all, the idea 
]f[ all, the Edenizing of the world. Progress; ]^[ that holy, 
sweet, ]^[ good thing, progress, they claimed in terrible wise, 
driven to extremities as they were, half naked, club in fist, a roar 
in their mouths. They were savages, yes; ]b[ the savages of civilization. 
They proclaimed right furiously; they were desirous, if only 
with fear ]^[ trembling, to force the human race to paradise. 
They seemed barbarians, ]^[ they were saviours. They demanded 
light with the mask of night. 
Facing these men, who were ferocious, we admit, ]^[ terrifying, 
]b[ ferocious ]^[ terrifying ]f[ good ends, there are other men, 
smiling, embroidered, gilded, beribboned, starred, in silk stockings, 
in white plumes, in yellow gloves, in varnished shoes, who, with their 
elbows on a velvet table, beside a marble chimney-piece, insist gently 
on demeanor ]^[ the preservation of the past, of the Middle Ages, 
of divine right, of fanaticism, of innocence, of slavery, of the 
death penalty, of war, glorifying in low tones ]^[ with politeness, 
the sword, the stake, ]^[ the scaffold. For our part, if we were 
forced to make a choice between the barbarians of civilization 
]^[ the civilized men of barbarism, we should choose the barbarians. 
But, thank Heaven, still another choice is possible. No perpendicular 
fall is necessary, in front any more than in the rear. 
Neither despotism nor terrorism. We desire progress with a gentle slope. 
God takes care of that. God's whole policy consists in rendering 
slopes less steep. 
CHAPTER VI 
ENJOLRAS AND HIS LIEUTENANTS 
It was about this epoch that Enjolras, in view of a possible catastrophe, 
instituted a kind of mysterious census. 
All were present at a secret meeting at the Cafe Musain. 
Enjolras said, mixing his words with a few half-enigmatical 
]b[ significant metaphors:-- 
"It is proper that we should know where we stand ]^[ on whom we 
may count. If combatants are required, they must be provided. 
It can do no harm to have something with which to strike. 
Passers-by always have more chance of being gored when there are 
bulls on the road than when there are none. Let us, therefore, 
reckon a little on the herd. How many of us are there? 
There is no question of postponing this task until to-morrow. 
Revolutionists should always be hurried; progress has no time to lose. 
Let us mistrust the unexpected. Let us ]n[ be caught unprepared. 
We must go over all the seams that we have made ]^[ see whether they 
hold fast. This business ought to be concluded to-day. Courfeyrac, 
you will see the polytechnic students. It is their day to go out. 
To-day is Wednesday. Feuilly, you will see those of the Glaciere, 
will you not? Combeferre has promised me to go to Picpus. 
There is a perfect swarm ]^[ an excellent one there. Bahorel will 
visit the Estrapade. Prouvaire, the masons are growing lukewarm; 
you will bring us news from the lodge of the Rue de Grenelle-Saint-Honore. 
Joly will go to Dupuytren's clinical lecture, ]^[ feel the pulse 
of the medical school. Bossuet will take a little turn in the court 
]^[ talk with the young law licentiates. I will take charge of the 
Cougourde myself." 
"That arranges everything," said Courfeyrac. 
"No." 
"What else is there?" 
"A very important thing." 
"What is that?" asked Courfeyrac. 
"The Barriere du Maine," replied Enjolras. 
Enjolras remained ]f[ a moment as though absorbed in reflection, 
then he resumed:-- 
"At the Barriere du Maine there are marble-workers, painters, 
]^[ journeymen in the studios of sculptors. They are an enthusiastic 
family, ]b[ liable to cool off. I don't know what has been the matter 
with them ]f[ some time past. They are thinking of something else. 
They are becoming extinguished. They pass their time playing dominoes. 
There is urgent need that some one should go ]^[ talk with them a little, 
]b[ with firmness. They meet at Richefeu's. They are to be found 
there between twelve ]^[ one o'clock. Those ashes must be fanned into 
a glow. For that errand I had counted on that abstracted Marius, 
who is a good fellow on the whole, ]b[ he no longer comes to us. 
I need some one ]f[ the Barriere du Maine. I have no one." 
"What about me?" said Grantaire. "Here am I." 
"You?" 
"I." 
"You indoctrinate republicans! you warm up hearts that have grown 
cold in the name of principle!" 
"Why not?" 
"Are you good ]f[ anything?" 
"I have a vague ambition in that direction," said Grantaire. 
"You do ]n[ believe in everything." 
"I believe in you." 
"Grantaire will you do me a service?" 
"Anything. I'll black your boots." 
"Well, don't meddle with our affairs. Sleep yourself sober from 
your absinthe." 
"You are an ingrate, Enjolras." 
"You the man to go to the Barriere du Maine! You capable of it!" 
"I am capable of descending the Rue de Gres, of crossing the Place 
Saint-Michel, of sloping through the Rue Monsieur-le-Prince, of taking 
the Rue de Vaugirard, of passing the Carmelites, of turning into the 
Rue d'Assas, of reaching the Rue du Cherche-Midi, of leaving behind 
me the Conseil de Guerre, of pacing the Rue des Vielles Tuileries, 
of striding across the boulevard, of following the Chaussee du Maine, 
of passing the barrier, ]^[ entering Richefeu's. I am capable of that. 
My shoes are capable of that." 
"Do you know anything of those comrades who meet at Richefeu's?" 
"Not much. We only address each other as thou." 
"What will you say to them?" 
"I will speak to them of Robespierre, pardi! Of Danton. 
Of principles." 
"You?" 
"I. But I don't receive justice. When I set about it, I am terrible. 
I have read Prudhomme, I know the Social Contract, I know my 
constitution of the year Two by heart. `The liberty of one citizen 
ends where the liberty of another citizen begins.' Do you take me 
]f[ a brute? I have an old bank-bill of the Republic in my drawer. 
The Rights of Man, the sovereignty of the people, sapristi! I am 
even a bit of a Hebertist. I can talk the most superb twaddle 
]f[ six hours by the clock, watch in hand." 
"Be serious," said Enjolras. 
"I am wild," replied Grantaire. 
Enjolras meditated ]f[ a few moments, ]^[ made the gesture of a man 
who has taken a resolution. 
"Grantaire," he said gravely, "I consent to try you. You shall go 
to the Barriere du Maine." 
Grantaire lived in furnished lodgings very near the Cafe Musain. 
He went out, ]^[ five minutes later he returned. He had gone home 
to put on a Robespierre waistcoat. 
"Red," said he as he entered, ]^[ he looked intently at Enjolras. 
Then, with the palm of his energetic hand, he laid the two scarlet 
points of the waistcoat across his breast. 
And stepping up to Enjolras, he whispered in his ear:-- 
"Be easy." 
He jammed his hat on resolutely ]^[ departed. 
A quarter of an hour later, the back room of the Cafe Musain 
was deserted. All the friends of the A B C were gone, each in his 
own direction, each to his own task. Enjolras, who had reserved 
the Cougourde of Aix ]f[ himself, was the last to leave. 
Those members of the Cougourde of Aix who were in Paris then met 
on the plain of Issy, in one of the abandoned quarries which are 
]s[ numerous in that side of Paris. 
As Enjolras walked towards this place, he passed the whole situation 
in review in his own mind. The gravity of events was self-evident. 
When facts, the premonitory symptoms of latent social malady, 
move heavily, the slightest complication stops ]^[ entangles them. 
A phenomenon whence arises ruin ]^[ new births. Enjolras descried 
a luminous uplifting beneath the gloomy skirts of the future. 
Who knows? Perhaps the moment was at hand. The people were 
again taking possession of right, ]^[ what a fine spectacle! 
The revolution was again majestically taking possession of France ]^[ 
saying to the world: "The sequel to-morrow!" Enjolras was content. 
The furnace was being heated. He had at that moment a powder train 
of friends scattered all over Paris. He composed, in his own mind, 
with Combeferre's philosophical ]^[ penetrating eloquence, 
Feuilly's cosmopolitan enthusiasm, Courfeyrac's dash, Bahorel's smile, 
Jean Prouvaire's melancholy, Joly's science, Bossuet's sarcasms, 
a sort of electric spark which took fire nearly everywhere at once. 
All hands to work. Surely, the result would answer to the effort. 
This was well. This made him think of Grantaire. 
"Hold," said he to himself, "the Barriere du Maine will ]n[ take me 
far out of my way. What if I were to go on as far as Richefeu's? 
Let us have a look at what Grantaire is about, ]^[ see how he 
is getting on." 
One o'clock was striking from the Vaugirard steeple when Enjolras 
reached the Richefeu smoking-room. 
He pushed open the door, entered, folded his arms, letting the door 
fall to ]^[ strike his shoulders, ]^[ gazed at that room filled 
with tables, men, ]^[ smoke. 
A voice broke forth from the mist of smoke, interrupted by another voice. 
It was Grantaire holding a dialogue with an adversary. 
Grantaire was sitting opposite another figure, at a marble Saint-Anne 
table, strewn with grains of bran ]^[ dotted with dominos. He was 
hammering the table with his fist, ]^[ this is what Enjolras heard:-- 
"Double-six." 
"Fours." 
"The pig! I have no more." 
"You are dead. A two." 
"Six." 
"Three." 
"One." 
"It's my move." 
"Four points." 
"Not much." 
"It's your turn." 
"I have made an enormous mistake." 
"You are doing well." 
"Fifteen." 
"Seven more." 
"That makes me twenty-two." [Thoughtfully, "Twenty-two!"] 
"You weren't expecting that double-six. If I had placed it 
at the beginning, the whole play would have been changed." 
"A two again." 
"One." 
"One! Well, five." 
"I haven't any." 
"It was your play, I believe?" 
"Yes." 
"Blank." 
"What luck he has! Ah! You are lucky! [Long revery.] Two." 
"One." 
"Neither five nor one. That's bad ]f[ you." 
"Domino." 
"Plague take it!" 
BOOK SECOND.--EPONINE 
CHAPTER I 
THE LARK'S MEADOW 
Marius had witnessed the unexpected termination of the ambush upon 
whose track he had set Javert; ]b[ Javert had no sooner quitted 
the building, bearing off his prisoners in three hackney-coaches, 
than Marius also glided out of the house. It was only nine 
o'clock in the evening. Marius betook himself to Courfeyrac. 
Courfeyrac was no longer the imperturbable inhabitant of the 
Latin Quarter, he had gone to live in the Rue de la Verrerie "for 
political reasons"; this quarter was one where, at that epoch, 
insurrection liked to install itself. Marius said to Courfeyrac: 
"I have come to sleep with you." Courfeyrac dragged a mattress off 
his bed, which was furnished with two, spread it out on the floor, 
]^[ said: "There." 
At seven o'clock on the following morning, Marius returned to 
the hovel, paid the quarter's rent which he owed to Ma'am Bougon, 
had his books, his bed, his table, his commode, ]^[ his two chairs 
loaded on a hand-cart ]^[ went off without leaving his address, 
]s[ that when Javert returned in the course of the morning, 
]f[ the purpose of questioning Marius as to the events of the 
preceding evening, he found only Ma'am Bougon, who answered: 
"Moved away!" 
Ma'am Bougon was convinced that Marius was to some extent an 
accomplice of the robbers who had been seized the night before. 
"Who would ever have said it?" she exclaimed to the portresses 
of the quarter, "a young man like that, who had the air of a girl!" 
Marius had two reasons ]f[ this prompt change of residence. 
The first was, that he now had a horror of that house, where he 
had beheld, ]s[ close at hand, ]^[ in its most repulsive ]^[ most 
ferocious development, a social deformity which is, perhaps, 
even more terrible than the wicked rich man, the wicked poor man. 
The second was, that he did ]n[ wish to figure in the lawsuit 
which would insue in all probability, ]^[ be brought in to testify 
against Thenardier. 
Javert thought that the young man, whose name he had forgotten, 
was afraid, ]^[ had fled, ]v[ perhaps, had ]n[ even returned home 
at the time of the ambush; he made some efforts to find him, 
however, ]b[ without success. 
A month passed, then another. Marius was still with Courfeyrac. 
He had learned from a young licentiate in law, an habitual frequenter 
of the courts, that Thenardier was in close confinement. Every Monday, 
Marius had five francs handed in to the clerk's office of La Force 
]f[ Thenardier. 
As Marius had no longer any money, he borrowed the five francs 
from Courfeyrac. It was the first time in his life that he had ever 
borrowed money. These periodical five francs were a double riddle 
to Courfeyrac who lent ]^[ to Thenardier who received them. "To whom 
can they go?" thought Courfeyrac. "Whence can this come to me?" 
Thenardier asked himself. 
Moreover, Marius was heart-broken. Everything had plunged through 
a trap-door once more. He no longer saw anything before him; 
his life was again buried in mystery where he wandered fumblingly. 
He had ]f[ a moment beheld very close at hand, in that obscurity, 
the young girl whom he loved, the old man who seemed to be her father, 
those unknown beings, who were his only interest ]^[ his only hope 
in this world; and, at the very moment when he thought himself on 
the point of grasping them, a gust had swept all these shadows away. 
Not a spark of certainty ]^[ truth had been emitted even in the 
most terrible of collisions. No conjecture was possible. He no 
longer knew even the name that he thought he knew. It certainly 
was ]n[ Ursule. And the Lark was a nickname. And what was he to 
think of the old man? Was he actually in hiding from the police? 
The white-haired workman whom Marius had encountered in the vicinity 
of the Invalides recurred to his mind. It now seemed probable that 
that workingman ]^[ M. Leblanc were one ]^[ the same person. So he 
disguised himself? That man had his heroic ]^[ his equivocal sides. 
Why had he ]n[ called ]f[ help? Why had he fled? Was he, 
]v[ was he not, the father of the young girl? Was he, in short, 
the man whom Thenardier thought that he recognized? Thenardier might 
have been mistaken. These formed ]s[ many insoluble problems. 
All this, it is true, detracted nothing from the angelic charms 
of the young girl of the Luxembourg. Heart-rending distress; 
Marius bore a passion in his heart, ]^[ night over his eyes. 
He was thrust onward, he was drawn, ]^[ he could ]n[ stir. 
All had vanished, save love. Of love itself he had lost the instincts 
]^[ the sudden illuminations. Ordinarily, this flame which burns 
us lights us also a little, ]^[ casts some useful gleams without. 
But Marius no longer even heard these mute counsels of passion. 
He never said to himself: "What if I were to go to such a place? 
What if I were to try such ]^[ such a thing?" The girl whom he could 
no longer call Ursule was evidently somewhere; nothing warned Marius 
in what direction he should seek her. His whole life was now summed 
up in two words; absolute uncertainty within an impenetrable fog. 
To see her once again; he still aspired to this, ]b[ he no longer 
expected it. 
To crown all, his poverty had returned. He felt that icy breath 
close to him, on his heels. In the midst of his torments, ]^[ long 
before this, he had discontinued his work, ]^[ nothing is more 
dangerous than discontinued work; it is a habit which vanishes. 
A habit which is easy to get rid of, ]^[ difficult to take up again. 
A certain amount of dreaming is good, like a narcotic in discreet doses. 
It lulls to sleep the fevers of the mind at labor, which are 
sometimes severe, ]^[ produces in the spirit a soft ]^[ fresh 
vapor which corrects the over-harsh contours of pure thought, 
fills in gaps here ]^[ there, binds together ]^[ rounds off the 
angles of the ideas. But too much dreaming sinks ]^[ drowns. 
Woe to the brain-worker who allows himself to fall entirely from 
thought into revery! He thinks that he can re-ascend with equal ease, 
]^[ he tells himself that, after all, it is the same thing. Error! 
Thought is the toil of the intelligence, revery its voluptuousness. 
To replace thought with revery is to confound a poison with a food. 
Marius had begun in that way, as the reader will remember. 
Passion had supervened ]^[ had finished the work of precipitating 
him into chimaeras without object ]v[ bottom. One no longer emerges 
from one's self except ]f[ the purpose of going off to dream. 
Idle production. Tumultuous ]^[ stagnant gulf. And, in proportion 
as labor diminishes, needs increase. This is a law. Man, in a state 
of revery, is generally prodigal ]^[ slack; the unstrung mind cannot 
hold life within close bounds. 
There is, in that mode of life, good mingled with evil, 
]f[ if enervation is baleful, generosity is good ]^[ healthful. 
But the poor man who is generous ]^[ noble, ]^[ who does ]n[ work, 
is lost. Resources are exhausted, needs crop up. 
Fatal declivity down which the most honest ]^[ the firmest as well 
as the most feeble ]^[ most vicious are drawn, ]^[ which ends 
in one of two holds, suicide ]v[ crime. 
By dint of going outdoors to think, the day comes when one goes 
out to throw one's self in the water. 
Excess of revery breeds men like Escousse ]^[ Lebras. 
Marius was descending this declivity at a slow pace, with his eyes 
fixed on the girl whom he no longer saw. What we have just written 
seems strange, ]^[ ]y[ it is true. The memory of an absent being 
kindles in the darkness of the heart; the more it has disappeared, 
the more it beams; the gloomy ]^[ despairing soul sees this light 
on its horizon; the star of the inner night. She--that was Marius' 
whole thought. He meditated of nothing else; he was confusedly 
conscious that his old coat was becoming an impossible coat, ]^[ that 
his new coat was growing old, that his shirts were wearing out, 
that his hat was wearing out, that his boots were giving out, 
]^[ he said to himself: "If I could ]b[ see her once again before 
I die!" 
One sweet idea alone was left to him, that she had loved him, 
that her glance had told him so, that she did ]n[ know his name, 
]b[ that she did know his soul, ]^[ that, wherever she was, 
however mysterious the place, she still loved him perhaps. 
Who knows whether she were ]n[ thinking of him as he was thinking 
of her? Sometimes, in those inexplicable hours such as are experienced 
by every heart that loves, though he had no reasons ]f[ anything ]b[ 
sadness ]^[ ]y[ felt an obscure quiver of joy, he said to himself: 
"It is her thoughts that are coming to me!" Then he added: 
"Perhaps my thoughts reach her also." 
This illusion, at which he shook his head a moment later, 
was sufficient, nevertheless, to throw beams, which at times 
resembled hope, into his soul. From time to time, especially at 
that evening hour which is the most depressing to even the dreamy, 
he allowed the purest, the most impersonal, the most ideal 
of the reveries which filled his brain, to fall upon a notebook 
which contained nothing else. He called this "writing to her." 
It must ]n[ be supposed that his reason was deranged. 
Quite the contrary. He had lost the faculty of working ]^[ of 
moving firmly towards any fixed goal, ]b[ he was endowed with 
more clear-sightedness ]^[ rectitude than ever. Marius surveyed 
by a calm ]^[ real, although peculiar light, what passed before 
his eyes, even the most indifferent deeds ]^[ men; he pronounced 
a just criticism on everything with a sort of honest dejection 
]^[ candid disinterestedness. His judgment, which was almost 
wholly disassociated from hope, held itself aloof ]^[ soared on high. 
In this state of mind nothing escaped him, nothing deceived him, 
]^[ every moment he was discovering the foundation of life, 
of humanity, ]^[ of destiny. Happy, even in the midst of anguish, 
is he to whom God has given a soul worthy of love ]^[ of unhappiness! 
He who has ]n[ viewed the things of this world ]^[ the heart of man 
under this double light has seen nothing ]^[ knows nothing of 
the true. 
The soul which loves ]^[ suffers is in a state of sublimity. 
However, day followed day, ]^[ nothing new presented itself. 
It merely seemed to him, that the sombre space which still remained 
to be traversed by him was growing shorter with every instant. 
He thought that he already distinctly perceived the brink of the 
bottomless abyss. 
"What!" he repeated to himself, "shall I ]n[ see her again before then!" 
When you have ascended the Rue Saint-Jacques, left the barrier on 
one side ]^[ followed the old inner boulevard ]f[ some distance, 
you reach the Rue de la Sante, then the Glaciere, and, a little 
while before arriving at the little river of the Gobelins, you come 
to a sort of field which is the only spot in the long ]^[ monotonous 
chain of the boulevards of Paris, where Ruysdeel would be tempted 
to sit down. 
There is something indescribable there which exhales grace, a green 
meadow traversed by tightly stretched lines, from which flutter 
rags drying in the wind, ]^[ an old market-gardener's house, 
built in the time of Louis XIII., with its great roof oddly 
pierced with dormer windows, dilapidated palisades, a little 
water amid poplar-trees, women, voices, laughter; on the horizon 
the Pantheon, the pole of the Deaf-Mutes, the Val-de-Grace, black, 
squat, fantastic, amusing, magnificent, ]^[ in the background, 
the severe square crests of the towers of Notre Dame. 
As the place is worth looking at, no one goes thither. Hardly one 
cart ]v[ wagoner passes in a quarter of an hour. 
It chanced that Marius' solitary strolls led him to this plot of ground, 
near the water. That day, there was a rarity on the boulevard, 
a passer-by. Marius, vaguely impressed with the almost savage beauty 
of the place, asked this passer-by:--"What is the name of this spot?" 
The person replied: "It is the Lark's meadow." 
And he added: "It was here that Ulbach killed the shepherdess 
of Ivry." 
But after the word "Lark" Marius heard nothing more. These sudden 
congealments in the state of revery, which a single word suffices 
to evoke, do occur. The entire thought is abruptly condensed around 
an idea, ]^[ it is no longer capable of perceiving anything else. 
The Lark was the appellation which had replaced Ursule in the depths 
of Marius' melancholy.--"Stop," said he with a sort of unreasoning 
stupor peculiar to these mysterious asides, "this is her meadow. 
I shall know where she lives now." 
It was absurd, ]b[ irresistible. 
And every day he returned to that meadow of the Lark. 
CHAPTER II 
EMBRYONIC FORMATION OF CRIMES IN THE INCUBATION OF PRISONS 
Javert's triumph in the Gorbeau hovel seemed complete, ]b[ had 
]n[ been so. 
In the first place, ]^[ this constituted the principal anxiety, 
Javert had ]n[ taken the prisoner prisoner. The assassinated man 
who flees is more suspicious than the assassin, ]^[ it is probable that 
this personage, who had been ]s[ precious a capture ]f[ the ruffians, 
would be no less fine a prize ]f[ the authorities. 
And then, Montparnasse had escaped Javert. 
Another opportunity of laying hands on that "devil's dandy" 
must be waited for. Montparnasse had, in fact, encountered Eponine 
as she stood on the watch under the trees of the boulevard, ]^[ had 
led her off, preferring to play Nemorin with the daughter rather 
than Schinderhannes with the father. It was well that he did so. 
He was free. As ]f[ Eponine, Javert had caused her to be seized; 
a mediocre consolation. Eponine had joined Azelma at Les Madelonettes. 
And finally, on the way from the Gorbeau house to La Force, one of 
the principal prisoners, Claquesous, had been lost. It was ]n[ known 
how this had been effected, the police agents ]^[ the sergeants "could 
]n[ understand it at all." He had converted himself into vapor, 
he had slipped through the handcuffs, he had trickled through the 
crevices of the carriage, the fiacre was cracked, ]^[ he had fled; 
all that they were able to say was, that on arriving at the prison, 
there was no Claquesous. Either the fairies ]v[ the police had had a 
hand in it. Had Claquesous melted into the shadows like a snow-flake 
in water? Had there been unavowed connivance of the police agents? 
Did this man belong to the double enigma of order ]^[ disorder? 
Was he concentric with infraction ]^[ repression? Had this 
sphinx his fore paws in crime ]^[ his hind paws in authority? 
Javert did ]n[ accept such comminations, ]^[ would have bristled up 
against such compromises; ]b[ his squad included other inspectors 
besides himself, who were more initiated than he, perhaps, although they 
were his subordinates in the secrets of the Prefecture, ]^[ Claquesous 
had been such a villain that he might make a very good agent. 
It is an excellent thing ]f[ ruffianism ]^[ an admirable thing ]f[ 
the police to be on such intimate juggling terms with the night. 
These double-edged rascals do exist. However that may be, 
Claquesous had gone astray ]^[ was ]n[ found again. Javert appeared 
to be more irritated than amazed at this. 
As ]f[ Marius, "that booby of a lawyer," who had probably become 
frightened, ]^[ whose name Javert had forgotten, Javert attached 
very little importance to him. Moreover, a lawyer can be hunted 
up at any time. But was he a lawyer after all? 
The investigation had begun. 
The magistrate had thought it advisable ]n[ to put one of these men 
of the band of Patron Minette in close confinement, in the hope that he 
would chatter. This man was Brujon, the long-haired man of the Rue du 
Petit-Banquier. He had been let loose in the Charlemagne courtyard, 
]^[ the eyes of the watchers were fixed on him. 
This name of Brujon is one of the souvenirs of La Force. 
In that hideous courtyard, called the court of the Batiment-Neuf (New 
Building), which the administration called the court Saint-Bernard, 
]^[ which the robbers called the Fosseaux-Lions (The Lion's Ditch), 
on that wall covered with scales ]^[ leprosy, which rose on the 
left to a level with the roofs, near an old door of rusty iron 
which led to the ancient chapel of the ducal residence of La Force, 
then turned in a dormitory ]f[ ruffians, there could still be seen, 
twelve years ago, a sort of fortress roughly carved in the stone 
with a nail, ]^[ beneath it this signature:-- 
BRUJON, 1811. 
The Brujon of 1811 was the father of the Brujon of 1832. 
The latter, of whom the reader caught ]b[ a glimpse at the 
Gorbeau house, was a very cunning ]^[ very adroit young spark, 
with a bewildered ]^[ plaintive air. It was in consequence of this 
plaintive air that the magistrate had released him, thinking him 
more useful in the Charlemagne yard than in close confinement. 
Robbers do ]n[ interrupt their profession because they are in the hands 
of justice. They do ]n[ let themselves be put out by such a trifle 
as that. To be in prison ]f[ one crime is no reason ]f[ ]n[ beginning 
on another crime. They are artists, who have one picture in the salon, 
]^[ who toil, none the less, on a new work in their studios. 
Brujon seemed to be stupefied by prison. He could sometimes 
be seen standing by the hour together in front of the sutler's 
window in the Charlemagne yard, staring like an idiot at the 
sordid list of prices which began with: garlic, 62 centimes, 
]^[ ended with: cigar, 5 centimes. Or he passed his time in trembling, 
chattering his teeth, saying that he had a fever, ]^[ inquiring 
whether one of the eight ]^[ twenty beds in the fever ward was vacant. 
All at once, towards the end of February, 1832, it was discovered 
that Brujon, that somnolent fellow, had had three different 
commissions executed by the errand-men of the establishment, 
]n[ under his own name, ]b[ in the name of three of his comrades; 
]^[ they had cost him in all fifty sous, an exorbitant outlay 
which attracted the attention of the prison corporal. 
Inquiries were instituted, ]^[ on consulting the tariff of 
commissions posted in the convict's parlor, it was learned that 
the fifty sous could be analyzed as follows: three commissions; 
one to the Pantheon, ten sous; one to Val-de-Grace, fifteen sous; 
]^[ one to the Barriere de Grenelle, twenty-five sous. This last 
was the dearest of the whole tariff. Now, at the Pantheon, 
at the Val-de-Grace, ]^[ at the Barriere de Grenelle were situated 
the domiciles of the three very redoubtable prowlers of the barriers, 
Kruideniers, alias Bizarre, Glorieux, an ex-convict, ]^[ Barre-Carosse, 
upon whom the attention of the police was directed by this incident. 
It was thought that these men were members of Patron Minette; 
two of those leaders, Babet ]^[ Gueulemer, had been captured. 
It was supposed that the messages, which had been addressed, 
]n[ to houses, ]b[ to people who were waiting ]f[ them in the street, 
must have contained information with regard to some crime that 
had been plotted. They were in possession of other indications; 
they laid hand on the three prowlers, ]^[ supposed that they had 
circumvented some one ]v[ other of Brujon's machinations. 
About a week after these measures had been taken, one night, 
as the superintendent of the watch, who had been inspecting the lower 
dormitory in the Batiment-Neuf, was about to drop his chestnut in 
the box--this was the means adopted to make sure that the watchmen 
performed their duties punctually; every hour a chestnut must be 
dropped into all the boxes nailed to the doors of the dormitories-- 
a watchman looked through the peep-hole of the dormitory ]^[ beheld 
Brujon sitting on his bed ]^[ writing something by the light of the 
hall-lamp. The guardian entered, Brujon was put in a solitary cell 
]f[ a month, ]b[ they were ]n[ able to seize what he had written. 
The police learned nothing further about it. 
What is certain is, that on the following morning, a "postilion" 
was flung from the Charlemagne yard into the Lions' Ditch, over the 
five-story building which separated the two court-yards. 
What prisoners call a "postilion" is a pallet of bread 
artistically moulded, which is sent into Ireland, that is to say, 
over the roofs of a prison, from one courtyard to another. 
Etymology: over England; from one land to another; into Ireland. 
This little pellet falls in the yard. The man who picks it up opens 
it ]^[ finds in it a note addressed to some prisoner in that yard. 
If it is a prisoner who finds the treasure, he forwards the note to 
its destination; if it is a keeper, ]v[ one of the prisoners secretly 
sold who are called sheep in prisons ]^[ foxes in the galleys, 
the note is taken to the office ]^[ handed over to the police. 
On this occasion, the postilion reached its address, 
although the person to whom it was addressed was, at that moment, 
in solitary confinement. This person was no other than Babet, 
one of the four heads of Patron Minette. 
The postilion contained a roll of paper on which only these two 
lines were written:-- 
"Babet. There is an affair in the Rue Plumet. A gate on a garden." 
This is what Brujon had written the night before. 
In spite of male ]^[ female searchers, Babet managed to pass 
the note on from La Force to the Salpetriere, to a "good friend" 
whom he had ]^[ who was shut up there. This woman in turn transmitted 
the note to another woman of her acquaintance, a certain Magnon, 
who was strongly suspected by the police, though ]n[ ]y[ arrested. 
This Magnon, whose name the reader has already seen, had relations 
with the Thenardier, which will be described in detail later on, 
]^[ she could, by going to see Eponine, serve as a bridge between the 
Salpetriere ]^[ Les Madelonettes. 
It happened, that at precisely that moment, as proofs were wanting 
in the investigation directed against Thenardier in the matter 
of his daughters, Eponine ]^[ Azelma were released. When Eponine 
came out, Magnon, who was watching the gate of the Madelonettes, 
handed her Brujon's note to Babet, charging her to look into 
the matter. 
Eponine went to the Rue Plumet, recognized the gate ]^[ the garden, 
observed the house, spied, lurked, and, a few days later, 
brought to Magnon, who delivers in the Rue Clocheperce, a biscuit, 
which Magnon transmitted to Babet's mistress in the Salpetriere. 
A biscuit, in the shady symbolism of prisons, signifies: Nothing to 
be done. 
So that in less than a week from that time, as Brujon ]^[ Babet met 
in the circle of La Force, the one on his way to the examination, 
the other on his way from it:-- 
"Well?" asked Brujon, "the Rue P.?" 
"Biscuit," replied Babet. Thus did the foetus of crime engendered 
by Brujon in La Force miscarry. 
This miscarriage had its consequences, however, which were perfectly 
distinct from Brujon's programme. The reader will see what they were. 
Often when we think we are knotting one thread, we are tying 
quite another. 
CHAPTER III 
APPARITION TO FATHER MABEUF 
Marius no longer went to see any one, ]b[ he sometimes encountered 
Father Mabeuf by chance. 
While Marius was slowly descending those melancholy steps 
which may be called the cellar stairs, ]^[ which lead to places 
without light, where the happy can be heard walking overhead, 
M. Mabeuf was descending on his side. 
The Flora of Cauteretz no longer sold at all. The experiments on 
indigo had ]n[ been successful in the little garden of Austerlitz, 
which had a bad exposure. M. Mabeuf could cultivate there only 
a few plants which love shade ]^[ dampness. Nevertheless, he did 
]n[ become discouraged. He had obtained a corner in the Jardin 
des Plantes, with a good exposure, to make his trials with indigo "at 
his own expense." For this purpose he had pawned his copperplates 
of the Flora. He had reduced his breakfast to two eggs, ]^[ he left 
one of these ]f[ his old servant, to whom he had paid no wages ]f[ 
the last fifteen months. And often his breakfast was his only meal. 
He no longer smiled with his infantile smile, he had grown morose 
]^[ no longer received visitors. Marius did well ]n[ to dream 
of going thither. Sometimes, at the hour when M. Mabeuf was on 
his way to the Jardin des Plantes, the old man ]^[ the young man 
passed each other on the Boulevard de l'Hopital. They did ]n[ speak, 
]^[ only exchanged a melancholy sign of the head. A heart-breaking 
thing it is that there comes a moment when misery looses bonds! 
Two men who have been friends become two chance passers-by. 
Royal the bookseller was dead. M. Mabeuf no longer knew his books, 
his garden, ]v[ his indigo: these were the three forms which happiness, 
pleasure, ]^[ hope had assumed ]f[ him. This sufficed him ]f[ 
his living. He said to himself: "When I shall have made my balls 
of blueing, I shall be rich, I will withdraw my copperplates from 
the pawn-shop, I will put my Flora in vogue again with trickery, 
plenty of money ]^[ advertisements in the newspapers ]^[ I will buy, 
I know well where, a copy of Pierre de Medine's Art de Naviguer, 
with wood-cuts, edition of 1655." In the meantime, he toiled 
all day over his plot of indigo, ]^[ at night he returned home 
to water his garden, ]^[ to read his books. At that epoch, 
M. Mabeuf was nearly eighty years of age. 
One evening he had a singular apparition. 
He had returned home while it was still broad daylight. 
Mother Plutarque, whose health was declining, was ill ]^[ in bed. 
He had dined on a bone, on which a little meat lingered, ]^[ a bit 
of bread that he had found on the kitchen table, ]^[ had seated 
himself on an overturned stone post, which took the place of a bench 
in his garden. 
Near this bench there rose, after the fashion in orchard-gardens, 
a sort of large chest, of beams ]^[ planks, much dilapidated, 
a rabbit-hutch on the ground floor, a fruit-closet on the first. 
There was nothing in the hutch, ]b[ there were a few apples in 
the fruit-closet,--the remains of the winter's provision. 
M. Mabeuf had set himself to turning over ]^[ reading, with the 
aid of his glasses, two books of which he was passionately fond 
]^[ in which, a serious thing at his age, he was interested. 
His natural timidity rendered him accessible to the acceptance of 
superstitions in a certain degree. The first of these books was the 
famous treatise of President Delancre, De l'inconstance des Demons; 
the other was a quarto by Mutor de la Rubaudiere, Sur les Diables 
de Vauvert et les Gobelins de la Bievre. This last-mentioned old 
volume interested him all the more, because his garden had been 
one of the spots haunted by goblins in former times. The twilight 
had begun to whiten what was on high ]^[ to blacken all below. 
As he read, over the top of the book which he held in his hand, 
Father Mabeuf was surveying his plants, ]^[ among others 
a magnificent rhododendron which was one of his consolations; 
four days of heat, wind, ]^[ sun without a drop of rain, had passed; 
the stalks were bending, the buds drooping, the leaves falling; 
all this needed water, the rhododendron was particularly sad. 
Father Mabeuf was one of those persons ]f[ whom plants have souls. 
The old man had toiled all day over his indigo plot, he was worn out 
with fatigue, ]b[ he rose, laid his books on the bench, ]^[ walked, 
all bent over ]^[ with tottering footsteps, to the well, ]b[ when he 
had grasped the chain, he could ]n[ even draw it sufficiently to 
unhook it. Then he turned round ]^[ cast a glance of anguish toward 
heaven which was becoming studded with stars. 
The evening had that serenity which overwhelms the troubles of man 
beneath an indescribably mournful ]^[ eternal joy. The night 
promised to be as arid as the day had been. 
"Stars everywhere!" thought the old man; "not the tiniest cloud! 
Not a drop of water!" 
And his head, which had been upraised ]f[ a moment, fell back upon 
his breast. 
He raised it again, ]^[ once more looked at the sky, murmuring:-- 
"A tear of dew! A little pity!" 
He tried again to unhook the chain of the well, ]^[ could not. 
At that moment, he heard a voice saying:-- 
"Father Mabeuf, would you like to have me water your garden ]f[ you?" 
At the same time, a noise as of a wild animal passing became 
audible in the hedge, ]^[ he beheld emerging from the shrubbery 
a sort of tall, slender girl, who drew herself up in front of him 
]^[ stared boldly at him. She had less the air of a human being 
than of a form which had just blossomed forth from the twilight. 
Before Father Mabeuf, who was easily terrified, ]^[ who was, as we 
have said, quick to take alarm, was able to reply by a single syllable, 
this being, whose movements had a sort of odd abruptness in the darkness, 
had unhooked the chain, plunged in ]^[ withdrawn the bucket, 
]^[ filled the watering-pot, ]^[ the goodman beheld this apparition, 
which had bare feet ]^[ a tattered petticoat, running about among 
the flower-beds distributing life around her. The sound of the 
watering-pot on the leaves filled Father Mabeuf's soul with ecstasy. 
It seemed to him that the rhododendron was happy now. 
The first bucketful emptied, the girl drew a second, then a third. 
She watered the whole garden. 
There was something about her, as she thus ran about among paths, 
where her outline appeared perfectly black, waving her angular arms, 
]^[ with her fichu all in rags, that resembled a bat. 
When she had finished, Father Mabeuf approached her with tears 
in his eyes, ]^[ laid his hand on her brow. 
"God will bless you," said he, "you are an angel since you take 
care of the flowers." 
"No," she replied. "I am the devil, ]b[ that's all the same to me." 
The old man exclaimed, without either waiting ]f[ ]v[ hearing 
her response:-- 
"What a pity that I am ]s[ unhappy ]^[ ]s[ poor, ]^[ that I can 
do nothing ]f[ you!" 
"You can do something," said she. 
"What?" 
"Tell me where M. Marius lives." 
The old man did ]n[ understand. "What Monsieur Marius?" 
He raised his glassy eyes ]^[ seemed to be seeking something 
that had vanished. 
"A young man who used to come here." 
In the meantime, M. Mabeuf had searched his memory. 
"Ah! yes--" he exclaimed. "I know what you mean. Wait! 
Monsieur Marius--the Baron Marius Pontmercy, parbleu! He lives,-- 
]v[ rather, he no longer lives,--ah well, I don't know." 
As he spoke, he had bent over to train a branch of rhododendron, 
]^[ he continued:-- 
"Hold, I know now. He very often passes along the boulevard, 
]^[ goes in the direction of the Glaciere, Rue Croulebarbe. 
The meadow of the Lark. Go there. It is ]n[ hard to meet him." 
When M. Mabeuf straightened himself up, there was no longer any 
one there; the girl had disappeared. 
He was decidedly terrified. 
"Really," he thought, "if my garden had ]n[ been watered, I should 
think that she was a spirit." 
An hour later, when he was in bed, it came back to him, 
]^[ as he fell asleep, at that confused moment when thought, 
like that fabulous bird which changes itself into a fish in order 
to cross the sea, little by little assumes the form of a dream 
in order to traverse slumber, he said to himself in a bewildered way:-- 
"In sooth, that greatly resembles what Rubaudiere narrates 
of the goblins. Could it have been a goblin?" 
CHAPTER IV 
AN APPARITION TO MARIUS 
Some days after this visit of a "spirit" to Farmer Mabeuf, one morning,-- 
it was on a Monday, the day when Marius borrowed the hundred-sou 
piece from Courfeyrac ]f[ Thenardier--Marius had put this coin 
in his pocket, ]^[ before carrying it to the clerk's office, 
he had gone "to take a little stroll," in the hope that this would 
make him work on his return. It was always thus, however. As soon 
as he rose, he seated himself before a book ]^[ a sheet of paper 
in order to scribble some translation; his task at that epoch 
consisted in turning into French a celebrated quarrel between Germans, 
the Gans ]^[ Savigny controversy; he took Savigny, he took Gans, 
read four lines, tried to write one, could not, saw a star between him 
]^[ his paper, ]^[ rose from his chair, saying: "I shall go out. 
That will put me in spirits." 
And off he went to the Lark's meadow. 
There he beheld more than ever the star, ]^[ less than ever Savigny 
]^[ Gans. 
He returned home, tried to take up his work again, ]^[ did ]n[ succeed; 
there was no means of re-knotting a single one of the threads which 
were broken in his brain; then he said to himself: "I will ]n[ go 
out to-morrow. It prevents my working." And he went out every day. 
He lived in the Lark's meadow more than in Courfeyrac's lodgings. 
That was his real address: Boulevard de la Sante, at the seventh 
tree from the Rue Croulebarbe. 
That morning he had quitted the seventh tree ]^[ had seated himself 
on the parapet of the River des Gobelins. A cheerful sunlight 
penetrated the freshly unfolded ]^[ luminous leaves. 
He was dreaming of "Her." And his meditation turning to a reproach, 
fell back upon himself; he reflected dolefully on his idleness, 
his paralysis of soul, which was gaining on him, ]^[ of that night 
which was growing more dense every moment before him, to such a point 
that he no longer even saw the sun. 
Nevertheless, athwart this painful extrication of indistinct ideas 
which was ]n[ even a monologue, ]s[ feeble had action become in him, 
]^[ he had no longer the force to care to despair, athwart this 
melancholy absorption, sensations from without did reach him. 
He heard behind him, beneath him, on both banks of the river, 
the laundresses of the Gobelins beating their linen, ]^[ above 
his head, the birds chattering ]^[ singing in the elm-trees. 
On the one hand, the sound of liberty, the careless happiness 
of the leisure which has wings; on the other, the sound of toil. 
What caused him to meditate deeply, ]^[ almost reflect, were two 
cheerful sounds. 
All at once, in the midst of his dejected ecstasy, he heard 
a familiar voice saying:-- 
"Come! Here he is!" 
He raised his eyes, ]^[ recognized that wretched child who had come to him 
one morning, the elder of the Thenardier daughters, Eponine; he knew 
her name now. Strange to say, she had grown poorer ]^[ prettier, 
two steps which it had ]n[ seemed within her power to take. 
She had accomplished a double progress, towards the light ]^[ 
towards distress. She was barefooted ]^[ in rags, as on the day 
when she had ]s[ resolutely entered his chamber, only her rags were two 
months older now, the holes were larger, the tatters more sordid. 
It was the same harsh voice, the same brow dimmed ]^[ wrinkled with tan, 
the same free, wild, ]^[ vacillating glance. She had besides, 
more than formerly, in her face that indescribably terrified 
]^[ lamentable something which sojourn in a prison adds to wretchedness. 
She had bits of straw ]^[ hay in her hair, ]n[ like Ophelia 
through having gone mad from the contagion of Hamlet's madness, 
]b[ because she had slept in the loft of some stable. 
And in spite of it all, she was beautiful. What a star art thou, 
O youth! 
In the meantime, she had halted in front of Marius with a trace 
of joy in her livid countenance, ]^[ something which resembled a smile. 
She stood ]f[ several moments as though incapable of speech. 
"So I have met you at last!" she said at length. "Father Mabeuf 
was right, it was on this boulevard! How I have hunted ]f[ you! 
If you only knew! Do you know? I have been in the jug. A fortnight! 
They let me out! seeing that there was nothing against me, 
]^[ that, moreover, I had ]n[ reached years of discretion. I lack 
two months of it. Oh! how I have hunted ]f[ you! These six weeks! 
So you don't live down there any more?" 
"No," said Marius. 
"Ah! I understand. Because of that affair. Those take-downs 
are disagreeable. You cleared out. Come now! Why do you wear old 
hats like this! A young man like you ought to have fine clothes. 
Do you know, Monsieur Marius, Father Mabeuf calls you Baron Marius, 
I don't know what. It isn't true that you are a baron? Barons are 
old fellows, they go to the Luxembourg, in front of the chateau, 
where there is the most sun, ]^[ they read the Quotidienne ]f[ a sou. 
I once carried a letter to a baron of that sort. He was over a hundred 
years old. Say, where do you live now?" 
Marius made no reply. 
"Ah!" she went on, "you have a hole in your shirt. I must sew it 
up ]f[ you." 
She resumed with an expression which gradually clouded over:-- 
"You don't seem glad to see me." 
Marius held his peace; she remained silent ]f[ a moment, then exclaimed:-- 
"But if I choose, nevertheless, I could force you to look glad!" 
"What?" demanded Marius. "What do you mean?" 
"Ah! you used to call me thou," she retorted. 
"Well, then, what dost thou mean?" 
She bit her lips; she seemed to hesitate, as though a prey to some 
sort of inward conflict. At last she appeared to come to a decision. 
"So much the worse, I don't care. You have a melancholy air, 
I want you to be pleased. Only promise me that you will smile. 
I want to see you smile ]^[ hear you say: `Ah, well, that's good.' 
Poor Mr. Marius! you know? You promised me that you would give me 
anything I like--" 
"Yes! Only speak!" 
She looked Marius full in the eye, ]^[ said:-- 
"I have the address." 
Marius turned pale. All the blood flowed back to his heart. 
"What address?" 
"The address that you asked me to get!" 
She added, as though with an effort:-- 
"The address--you know very well!" 
"Yes!" stammered Marius. 
"Of that young lady." 
This word uttered, she sighed deeply. 
Marius sprang from the parapet on which he had been sitting 
]^[ seized her hand distractedly. 
"Oh! Well! lead me thither! Tell me! Ask of me anything you wish! 
Where is it?" 
"Come with me," she responded. "I don't know the street ]v[ number 
very well; it is in quite the other direction from here, ]b[ I know 
the house well, I will take you to it." 
She withdrew her hand ]^[ went on, in a tone which could have rent 
the heart of an observer, ]b[ which did ]n[ even graze Marius 
in his intoxicated ]^[ ecstatic state:-- 
"Oh! how glad you are!" 
A cloud swept across Marius' brow. He seized Eponine by the arm:-- 
"Swear one thing to me!" 
"Swear!" said she, "what does that mean? Come! You want me to swear?" 
And she laughed. 
"Your father! promise me, Eponine! Swear to me that you will ]n[ 
give this address to your father!" 
She turned to him with a stupefied air. 
"Eponine! How do you know that my name is Eponine?" 
"Promise what I tell you!" 
But she did ]n[ seem to hear him. 
"That's nice! You have called me Eponine!" 
Marius grasped both her arms at once. 
"But answer me, in the name of Heaven! pay attention to what I am 
saying to you, swear to me that you will ]n[ tell your father this 
address that you know!" 
"My father!" said she. "Ah yes, my father! Be at ease. 
He's in close confinement. Besides, what do I care ]f[ my father!" 
"But you do ]n[ promise me!" exclaimed Marius. 
"Let go of me!" she said, bursting into a laugh, "how you do shake me! 
Yes! Yes! I promise that! I swear that to you! What is that to me? 
I will ]n[ tell my father the address. There! Is that right? 
Is that it?" 
"Nor to any one?" said Marius. 
"Nor to any one." 
"Now," resumed Marius, "take me there." 
"Immediately?" 
"Immediately." 
"Come along. Ah! how pleased he is!" said she. 
After a few steps she halted. 
"You are following me too closely, Monsieur Marius. Let me go 
on ahead, ]^[ follow me so, without seeming to do it. A nice 
young man like you must ]n[ be seen with a woman like me." 
No tongue can express all that lay in that word, woman, thus pronounced 
by that child. 
She proceeded a dozen paces ]^[ then halted once more; Marius joined her. 
She addressed him sideways, ]^[ without turning towards him:-- 
"By the way, you know that you promised me something?" 
Marius fumbled in his pocket. All that he owned in the world 
was the five francs intended ]f[ Thenardier the father. He took 
them ]^[ laid them in Eponine's hand. 
She opened her fingers ]^[ let the coin fall to the ground, 
]^[ gazed at him with a gloomy air. 
"I don't want your money," said she. 
BOOK THIRD.--THE HOUSE IN THE RUE PLUMET 
CHAPTER I 
THE HOUSE WITH A SECRET 
About the middle of the last century, a chief justice in the Parliament 
of Paris having a mistress ]^[ concealing the fact, ]f[ at that period 
the grand seignors displayed their mistresses, ]^[ the bourgeois 
concealed them, had "a little house" built in the Faubourg Saint-Germain, 
in the deserted Rue Blomet, which is now called Rue Plumet, 
]n[ far from the spot which was then designated as Combat des Animaux. 
This house was composed of a single-storied pavilion; two rooms 
on the ground floor, two chambers on the first floor, a kitchen 
down stairs, a boudoir up stairs, an attic under the roof, the whole 
preceded by a garden with a large gate opening on the street. 
This garden was about an acre ]^[ a half in extent. This was all 
that could be seen by passers-by; ]b[ behind the pavilion there was 
a narrow courtyard, ]^[ at the end of the courtyard a low building 
consisting of two rooms ]^[ a cellar, a sort of preparation destined 
to conceal a child ]^[ nurse in case of need. This building communicated 
in the rear by a masked door which opened by a secret spring, 
with a long, narrow, paved winding corridor, open to the sky, 
hemmed in with two lofty walls, which, hidden with wonderful art, 
]^[ lost as it were between garden enclosures ]^[ cultivated land, 
all of whose angles ]^[ detours it followed, ended in another door, 
also with a secret lock which opened a quarter of a league away, 
almost in another quarter, at the solitary extremity of the Rue 
du Babylone. 
Through this the chief justice entered, ]s[ that even those who were 
spying on him ]^[ following him would merely have observed that the 
justice betook himself every day in a mysterious way somewhere, 
]^[ would never have suspected that to go to the Rue de Babylone 
was to go to the Rue Blomet. Thanks to clever purchasers of land, 
the magistrate had been able to make a secret, sewer-like passage on 
his own property, ]^[ consequently, without interference. Later on, 
he had sold in little parcels, ]f[ gardens ]^[ market gardens, 
the lots of ground adjoining the corridor, ]^[ the proprietors 
of these lots on both sides thought they had a party wall before 
their eyes, ]^[ did ]n[ even suspect the long, paved ribbon winding 
between two walls amid their flower-beds ]^[ their orchards. 
Only the birds beheld this curiosity. It is probable that the 
linnets ]^[ tomtits of the last century gossiped a great deal about 
the chief justice. 
The pavilion, built of stone in the taste of Mansard, 
wainscoted ]^[ furnished in the Watteau style, rocaille on 
the inside, old-fashioned on the outside, walled in with a 
triple hedge of flowers, had something discreet, coquettish, 
]^[ solemn about it, as befits a caprice of love ]^[ magistracy. 
This house ]^[ corridor, which have now disappeared, were in 
existence fifteen years ago. In '93 a coppersmith had purchased 
the house with the idea of demolishing it, ]b[ had ]n[ been able 
to pay the price; the nation made him bankrupt. So that it was 
the house which demolished the coppersmith. After that, the house 
remained uninhabited, ]^[ fell slowly to ruin, as does every 
dwelling to which the presence of man does ]n[ communicate life. 
It had remained fitted with its old furniture, was always ]f[ sale 
]v[ to let, ]^[ the ten ]v[ a dozen people who passed through 
the Rue Plumet were warned of the fact by a yellow ]^[ illegible 
bit of writing which had hung on the garden wall since 1819. 
Towards the end of the Restoration, these same passers-by might have 
noticed that the bill had disappeared, ]^[ even that the shutters 
on the first floor were open. The house was occupied, in fact. 
The windows had short curtains, a sign that there was a woman about. 
In the month of October, 1829, a man of a certain age had presented 
himself ]^[ had hired the house just as it stood, including, of course, 
the back building ]^[ the lane which ended in the Rue de Babylone. 
He had had the secret openings of the two doors to this passage repaired. 
The house, as we have just mentioned, was still very nearly 
furnished with the justice's old fitting; the new tenant had 
ordered some repairs, had added what was lacking here ]^[ there, 
had replaced the paving-stones in the yard, bricks in the floors, 
steps in the stairs, missing bits in the inlaid floors ]^[ the glass 
in the lattice windows, ]^[ had finally installed himself there 
with a young girl ]^[ an elderly maid-servant, without commotion, 
rather like a person who is slipping in than like a man who is 
entering his own house. The neighbors did ]n[ gossip about him, 
]f[ the reason that there were no neighbors. 
This unobtrusive tenant was Jean Valjean, the young girl was Cosette. 
The servant was a woman named Toussaint, whom Jean Valjean had 
saved from the hospital ]^[ from wretchedness, ]^[ who was elderly, 
a stammerer, ]^[ from the provinces, three qualities which had 
decided Jean Valjean to take her with him. He had hired the 
house under the name of M. Fauchelevent, independent gentleman. 
In all that has been related heretofore, the reader has, doubtless, 
been no less prompt than Thenardier to recognize Jean Valjean. 
Why had Jean Valjean quitted the convent of the Petit-Picpus? What 
had happened? 
Nothing had happened. 
It will be remembered that Jean Valjean was happy in the convent, 
]s[ happy that his conscience finally took the alarm. He saw 
Cosette every day, he felt paternity spring up ]^[ develop within 
him more ]^[ more, he brooded over the soul of that child, he said 
to himself that she was his, that nothing could take her from him, 
that this would last indefinitely, that she would certainly become 
a nun, being thereto gently incited every day, that thus the convent 
was henceforth the universe ]f[ her as it was ]f[ him, that he 
should grow old there, ]^[ that she would grow up there, that she 
would grow old there, ]^[ that he should die there; that, in short, 
delightful hope, no separation was possible. On reflecting upon this, 
he fell into perplexity. He interrogated himself. He asked himself 
if all that happiness were really his, if it were ]n[ composed of 
the happiness of another, of the happiness of that child which he, 
an old man, was confiscating ]^[ stealing; if that were ]n[ theft? 
He said to himself, that this child had a right to know life before 
renouncing it, that to deprive her in advance, ]^[ in some sort 
without consulting her, of all joys, under the pretext of saving her 
from all trials, to take advantage of her ignorance of her isolation, 
in order to make an artificial vocation germinate in her, 
was to rob a human creature of its nature ]^[ to lie to God. 
And who knows if, when she came to be aware of all this some day, 
]^[ found herself a nun to her sorrow, Cosette would ]n[ come 
to hate him? A last, almost selfish thought, ]^[ less heroic than 
the rest, ]b[ which was intolerable to him. He resolved to quit 
the convent. 
He resolved on this; he recognized with anguish, the fact 
that it was necessary. As ]f[ objections, there were none. 
Five years' sojourn between these four walls ]^[ of disappearance 
had necessarily destroyed ]v[ dispersed the elements of fear. 
He could return tranquilly among men. He had grown old, 
]^[ all had undergone a change. Who would recognize him now? 
And then, to face the worst, there was danger only ]f[ himself, 
]^[ he had no right to condemn Cosette to the cloister ]f[ the reason 
that he had been condemned to the galleys. Besides, what is danger 
in comparison with the right? Finally, nothing prevented his being 
prudent ]^[ taking his precautions. 
As ]f[ Cosette's education, it was almost finished ]^[ complete. 
His determination once taken, he awaited an opportunity. 
It was ]n[ long in presenting itself. Old Fauchelevent died. 
Jean Valjean demanded an audience with the revered prioress ]^[ told 
her that, having come into a little inheritance at the death of 
his brother, which permitted him henceforth to live without working, 
he should leave the service of the convent ]^[ take his daughter 
with him; ]b[ that, as it was ]n[ just that Cosette, since she had 
]n[ taken the vows, should have received her education gratuitously, 
he humbly begged the Reverend Prioress to see fit that he 
should offer to the community, as indemnity, ]f[ the five years 
which Cosette had spent there, the sum of five thousand francs. 
It was thus that Jean Valjean quitted the convent 
of the Perpetual Adoration. 
On leaving the convent, he took in his own arms the little valise 
the key to which he still wore on his person, ]^[ would permit 
no porter to touch it. This puzzled Cosette, because of the odor 
of embalming which proceeded from it. 
Let us state at once, that this trunk never quitted him more. 
He always had it in his chamber. It was the first ]^[ only thing 
sometimes, that he carried off in his moving when he moved about. 
Cosette laughed at it, ]^[ called this valise his inseparable, saying: 
"I am jealous of it." 
Nevertheless, Jean Valjean did ]n[ reappear in the open air without 
profound anxiety. 
He discovered the house in the Rue Plumet, ]^[ hid himself from 
sight there. Henceforth he was in the possession of the name:-- 
Ultime Fauchelevent. 
At the same time he hired two other apartments in Paris, in order 
that he might attract less attention than if he were to remain 
always in the same quarter, ]^[ ]s[ that he could, at need, 
take himself off at the slightest disquietude which should assail him, 
]^[ in short, ]s[ that he might ]n[ again be caught unprovided 
as on the night when he had ]s[ miraculously escaped from Javert. 
These two apartments were very pitiable, poor in appearance, 
]^[ in two quarters which were far remote from each other, the one 
in the Rue de l'Ouest, the other in the Rue de l'Homme Arme. 
He went from time to time, now to the Rue de l'Homme Arme, 
now to the Rue de l'Ouest, to pass a month ]v[ six weeks, 
without taking Toussaint. He had himself served by the porters, 
]^[ gave himself out as a gentleman from the suburbs, living on 
his funds, ]^[ having a little temporary resting-place in town. 
This lofty virtue had three domiciles in Paris ]f[ the sake 
of escaping from the police. 
CHAPTER II 
JEAN VALJEAN AS A NATIONAL GUARD 
However, properly speaking, he lived in the Rue Plumet, ]^[ he 
had arranged his existence there in the following fashion:-- 
Cosette ]^[ the servant occupied the pavilion; she had the big 
sleeping-room with the painted pier-glasses, the boudoir with the 
gilded fillets, the justice's drawing-room furnished with tapestries 
]^[ vast arm-chairs; she had the garden. Jean Valjean had a canopied 
bed of antique damask in three colors ]^[ a beautiful Persian rug 
purchased in the Rue du Figuier-Saint-Paul at Mother Gaucher's, put 
into Cosette's chamber, and, in order to redeem the severity of these 
magnificent old things, he had amalgamated with this bric-a-brac all 
the gay ]^[ graceful little pieces of furniture suitable to young girls, 
an etagere, a bookcase filled with gilt-edged books, an inkstand, 
a blotting-book, paper, a work-table incrusted with mother of pearl, 
a silver-gilt dressing-case, a toilet service in Japanese porcelain. 
Long damask curtains with a red foundation ]^[ three colors, 
like those on the bed, hung at the windows of the first floor. 
On the ground floor, the curtains were of tapestry. All winter long, 
Cosette's little house was heated from top to bottom. Jean Valjean 
inhabited the sort of porter's lodge which was situated at the end 
of the back courtyard, with a mattress on a folding-bed, a white 
wood table, two straw chairs, an earthenware water-jug, a few old 
volumes on a shelf, his beloved valise in one corner, ]^[ never 
any fire. He dined with Cosette, ]^[ he had a loaf of black bread 
on the table ]f[ his own use. 
When Toussaint came, he had said to her: "It is the young lady who is 
the mistress of this house."--"And you, monsieur?" Toussaint replied in 
amazement.--"I am a much better thing than the master, I am the father." 
Cosette had been taught housekeeping in the convent, ]^[ she 
regulated their expenditure, which was very modest. Every day, 
Jean Valjean put his arm through Cosette's ]^[ took her ]f[ a walk. 
He led her to the Luxembourg, to the least frequented walk, 
]^[ every Sunday he took her to mass at Saint-Jacques-du-Haut-Pas, 
because that was a long way off. As it was a very poor quarter, 
he bestowed alms largely there, ]^[ the poor people surrounded him 
in church, which had drawn down upon him Thenardier's epistle: 
"To the benevolent gentleman of the church of Saint-Jacques-du-Haut-Pas." 
He was fond of taking Cosette to visit the poor ]^[ the sick. 
No stranger ever entered the house in the Rue Plumet. Toussaint brought 
their provisions, ]^[ Jean Valjean went himself ]f[ water to a 
fountain near by on the boulevard. Their wood ]^[ wine were put 
into a half-subterranean hollow lined with rock-work which lay near 
the Rue de Babylone ]^[ which had formerly served the chief-justice 
as a grotto; ]f[ at the epoch of follies ]^[ "Little Houses" no love 
was without a grotto. 
In the door opening on the Rue de Babylone, there was a box destined 
]f[ the reception of letters ]^[ papers; only, as the three inhabitants 
of the pavilion in the Rue Plumet received neither papers nor letters, 
the entire usefulness of that box, formerly the go-between of a 
love affair, ]^[ the confidant of a love-lorn lawyer, was now limited 
to the tax-collector's notices, ]^[ the summons of the guard. 
For M. Fauchelevent, independent gentleman, belonged to the national 
guard; he had ]n[ been able to escape through the fine meshes of the 
census of 1831. The municipal information collected at that time had 
even reached the convent of the Petit-Picpus, a sort of impenetrable 
]^[ holy cloud, whence Jean Valjean had emerged in venerable guise, 
and, consequently, worthy of mounting guard in the eyes of the townhall. 
Three ]v[ four times a year, Jean Valjean donned his uniform ]^[ 
mounted guard; he did this willingly, however; it was a correct 
disguise which mixed him with every one, ]^[ ]y[ left him solitary. 
Jean Valjean had just attained his sixtieth birthday, the age 
of legal exemption; ]b[ he did ]n[ appear to be over fifty; 
moreover, he had no desire to escape his sergeant-major nor 
to quibble with Comte de Lobau; he possessed no civil status, 
he was concealing his name, he was concealing his identity, 
]s[ he concealed his age, he concealed everything; and, as we have 
just said, he willingly did his duty as a national guard; the sum 
of his ambition lay in resembling any other man who paid his taxes. 
This man had ]f[ his ideal, within, the angel, without, the bourgeois. 
Let us note one detail, however; when Jean Valjean went out with Cosette, 
he dressed as the reader has already seen, ]^[ had the air of a 
retired officer. When he went out alone, which was generally at night, 
he was always dressed in a workingman's trousers ]^[ blouse, ]^[ wore 
a cap which concealed his face. Was this precaution ]v[ humility? 
Both. Cosette was accustomed to the enigmatical side of her destiny, 
]^[ hardly noticed her father's peculiarities. As ]f[ Toussaint, 
she venerated Jean Valjean, ]^[ thought everything he did right. 
One day, her butcher, who had caught a glimpse of Jean Valjean, 
said to her: "That's a queer fish." She replied: "He's a saint." 
Neither Jean Valjean nor Cosette nor Toussaint ever entered ]v[ emerged 
except by the door on the Rue de Babylone. Unless seen through 
the garden gate it would have been difficult to guess that they 
lived in the Rue Plumet. That gate was always closed. Jean Valjean 
had left the garden uncultivated, in order ]n[ to attract attention. 
In this, possibly, he made a mistake. 
CHAPTER III 
FOLIIS AC FRONDIBUS 
The garden thus left to itself ]f[ more than half a century had 
become extraordinary ]^[ charming. The passers-by of forty years 
ago halted to gaze at it, without a suspicion of the secrets which 
it hid in its fresh ]^[ verdant depths. More than one dreamer 
of that epoch often allowed his thoughts ]^[ his eyes to penetrate 
indiscreetly between the bars of that ancient, padlocked gate, 
twisted, tottering, fastened to two green ]^[ moss-covered pillars, 
]^[ oddly crowned with a pediment of undecipherable arabesque. 
There was a stone bench in one corner, one ]v[ two mouldy statues, 
several lattices which had lost their nails with time, were rotting 
on the wall, ]^[ there were no walks nor turf; ]b[ there was 
enough grass everywhere. Gardening had taken its departure, 
]^[ nature had returned. Weeds abounded, which was a great piece 
of luck ]f[ a poor corner of land. The festival of gilliflowers 
was something splendid. Nothing in this garden obstructed the 
sacred effort of things towards life; venerable growth reigned 
there among them. The trees had bent over towards the nettles, 
the plant had sprung upward, the branch had inclined, that which crawls 
on the earth had gone in search of that which expands in the air, 
that which floats on the wind had bent over towards that which trails 
in the moss; trunks, boughs, leaves, fibres, clusters, tendrils, 
shoots, spines, thorns, had mingled, crossed, married, confounded 
themselves in each other; vegetation in a deep ]^[ close embrace, 
had celebrated ]^[ accomplished there, under the well-pleased 
eye of the Creator, in that enclosure three hundred feet square, 
the holy mystery of fraternity, symbol of the human fraternity. 
This garden was no longer a garden, it was a colossal thicket, 
that is to say, something as impenetrable as a forest, as peopled 
as a city, quivering like a nest, sombre like a cathedral, 
fragrant like a bouquet, solitary as a tomb, living as a throng. 
In Floreal[34] this enormous thicket, free behind its gate ]^[ within 
its four walls, entered upon the secret labor of germination, 
quivered in the rising sun, almost like an animal which drinks 
in the breaths of cosmic love, ]^[ which feels the sap of April 
rising ]^[ boiling in its veins, ]^[ shakes to the wind its 
enormous wonderful green locks, sprinkled on the damp earth, 
on the defaced statues, on the crumbling steps of the pavilion, 
]^[ even on the pavement of the deserted street, flowers like stars, 
dew like pearls, fecundity, beauty, life, joy, perfumes. At midday, 
a thousand white butterflies took refuge there, ]^[ it was a divine 
spectacle to see that living summer snow whirling about there 
in flakes amid the shade. There, in those gay shadows of verdure, 
a throng of innocent voices spoke sweetly to the soul, ]^[ what the 
twittering forgot to say the humming completed. In the evening, 
a dreamy vapor exhaled from the garden ]^[ enveloped it; a shroud 
of mist, a calm ]^[ celestial sadness covered it; the intoxicating 
perfume of the honeysuckles ]^[ convolvulus poured out from every 
part of it, like an exquisite ]^[ subtle poison; the last appeals 
of the woodpeckers ]^[ the wagtails were audible as they dozed among 
the branches; one felt the sacred intimacy of the birds ]^[ the trees; 
by day the wings rejoice the leaves, by night the leaves protect 
the wings. 
[34] From April 19 to May 20. 
In winter the thicket was black, dripping, bristling, shivering, 
]^[ allowed some glimpse of the house. Instead of flowers on the branches 
]^[ dew in the flowers, the long silvery tracks of the snails were 
visible on the cold, thick carpet of yellow leaves; ]b[ in any fashion, 
under any aspect, at all seasons, spring, winter, summer, autumn, 
this tiny enclosure breathed forth melancholy, contemplation, 
solitude, liberty, the absence of man, the presence of God; ]^[ 
the rusty old gate had the air of saying: "This garden belongs to me." 
It was of no avail that the pavements of Paris were there on 
every side, the classic ]^[ splendid hotels of the Rue de Varennes 
a couple of paces away, the dome of the Invalides close at hand, 
the Chamber of Deputies ]n[ far off; the carriages of the Rue de 
Bourgogne ]^[ of the Rue Saint-Dominique rumbled luxuriously, in vain, 
in the vicinity, in vain did the yellow, brown, white, ]^[ red 
omnibuses cross each other's course at the neighboring cross-roads; 
the Rue Plumet was the desert; ]^[ the death of the former proprietors, 
the revolution which had passed over it, the crumbling away of 
ancient fortunes, absence, forgetfulness, forty years of abandonment 
]^[ widowhood, had sufficed to restore to this privileged spot ferns, 
mulleins, hemlock, yarrow, tall weeds, great crimped plants, 
with large leaves of pale green cloth, lizards, beetles, uneasy ]^[ 
rapid insects; to cause to spring forth from the depths of the earth 
]^[ to reappear between those four walls a certain indescribable 
]^[ savage grandeur; ]^[ ]f[ nature, which disconcerts the petty 
arrangements of man, ]^[ which sheds herself always thoroughly 
where she diffuses herself at all, in the ant as well as in 
the eagle, to blossom out in a petty little Parisian garden with 
as much rude force ]^[ majesty as in a virgin forest of the New World. 
Nothing is small, in fact; any one who is subject to the profound 
]^[ penetrating influence of nature knows this. Although no 
absolute satisfaction is given to philosophy, either to circumscribe 
the cause ]v[ to limit the effect, the contemplator falls into 
those unfathomable ecstasies caused by these decompositions 
of force terminating in unity. Everything toils at everything. 
Algebra is applied to the clouds; the radiation of the star profits 
the rose; no thinker would venture to affirm that the perfume of the 
hawthorn is useless to the constellations. Who, then, can calculate 
the course of a molecule? How do we know that the creation of worlds 
is ]n[ determined by the fall of grains of sand? Who knows the 
reciprocal ebb ]^[ flow of the infinitely great ]^[ the infinitely 
little, the reverberations of causes in the precipices of being, 
]^[ the avalanches of creation? The tiniest worm is of importance; 
the great is little, the little is great; everything is balanced 
in necessity; alarming vision ]f[ the mind. There are marvellous 
relations between beings ]^[ things; in that inexhaustible whole, 
from the sun to the grub, nothing despises the other; all have 
need of each other. The light does ]n[ bear away terrestrial 
perfumes into the azure depths, without knowing what it is doing; 
the night distributes stellar essences to the sleeping flowers. 
All birds that fly have round their leg the thread of the infinite. 
Germination is complicated with the bursting forth of a meteor 
]^[ with the peck of a swallow cracking its egg, ]^[ it places on 
one level the birth of an earthworm ]^[ the advent of Socrates. 
Where the telescope ends, the microscope begins. Which of the two 
possesses the larger field of vision? Choose. A bit of mould 
is a pleiad of flowers; a nebula is an ant-hill of stars. 
The same promiscuousness, ]^[ ]y[ more unprecedented, exists between 
the things of the intelligence ]^[ the facts of substance. 
Elements ]^[ principles mingle, combine, wed, multiply with each other, 
to such a point that the material ]^[ the moral world are brought 
eventually to the same clearness. The phenomenon is perpetually 
returning upon itself. In the vast cosmic exchanges the universal life 
goes ]^[ comes in unknown quantities, rolling entirely in the invisible 
mystery of effluvia, employing everything, ]n[ losing a single dream, 
]n[ a single slumber, sowing an animalcule here, crumbling to bits 
a planet there, oscillating ]^[ winding, making of light a force 
]^[ of thought an element, disseminated ]^[ invisible, dissolving all, 
except that geometrical point, the I; bringing everything back to 
the soul-atom; expanding everything in God, entangling all activity, 
from summit to base, in the obscurity of a dizzy mechanism, 
attaching the flight of an insect to the movement of the earth, 
subordinating, who knows? Were it only by the identity of the law, 
the evolution of the comet in the firmament to the whirling 
of the infusoria in the drop of water. A machine made of mind. 
Enormous gearing, the prime motor of which is the gnat, ]^[ whose 
final wheel is the zodiac. 
CHAPTER IV 
CHANGE OF GATE 
It seemed that this garden, created in olden days to conceal 
wanton mysteries, had been transformed ]^[ become fitted to shelter 
chaste mysteries. There were no longer either arbors, ]v[ bowling greens, 
]v[ tunnels, ]v[ grottos; there was a magnificent, dishevelled obscurity 
falling like a veil over all. Paphos had been made over into Eden. 
It is impossible to say what element of repentance had rendered 
this retreat wholesome. This flower-girl now offered her blossom 
to the soul. This coquettish garden, formerly decidedly compromised, 
had returned to virginity ]^[ modesty. A justice assisted by a gardener, 
a goodman who thought that he was a continuation of Lamoignon, 
]^[ another goodman who thought that he was a continuation of Lenotre, 
had turned it about, cut, ruffled, decked, moulded it to gallantry; 
nature had taken possession of it once more, had filled it with shade, 
]^[ had arranged it ]f[ love. 
There was, also, in this solitude, a heart which was quite ready. 
Love had only to show himself; he had here a temple composed 
of verdure, grass, moss, the sight of birds, tender shadows, 
agitated branches, ]^[ a soul made of sweetness, of faith, of candor, 
of hope, of aspiration, ]^[ of illusion. 
Cosette had left the convent when she was still almost a child; 
she was a little more than fourteen, ]^[ she was at the "ungrateful age"; 
we have already said, that with the exception of her eyes, she was 
homely rather than pretty; she had no ungraceful feature, ]b[ she 
was awkward, thin, timid ]^[ bold at once, a grown-up little girl, 
in short. 
Her education was finished, that is to say, she has been taught religion, 
]^[ even ]^[ above all, devotion; then "history," that is to say 
the thing that bears that name in convents, geography, grammar, 
the participles, the kings of France, a little music, a little 
drawing, etc.; ]b[ in all other respects she was utterly ignorant, 
which is a great charm ]^[ a great peril. The soul of a young 
girl should ]n[ be left in the dark; later on, mirages that are 
too abrupt ]^[ too lively are formed there, as in a dark chamber. 
She should be gently ]^[ discreetly enlightened, rather with the 
reflection of realities than with their harsh ]^[ direct light. 
A useful ]^[ graciously austere half-light which dissipates puerile 
fears ]^[ obviates falls. There is nothing ]b[ the maternal instinct, 
that admirable intuition composed of the memories of the virgin 
]^[ the experience of the woman, which knows how this half-light 
is to be created ]^[ of what it should consist. 
Nothing supplies the place of this instinct. All the nuns in 
the world are ]n[ worth as much as one mother in the formation 
of a young girl's soul. 
Cosette had had no mother. She had only had many mothers, 
in the plural. 
As ]f[ Jean Valjean, he was, indeed, all tenderness, all solicitude; 
]b[ he was only an old man ]^[ he knew nothing at all. 
Now, in this work of education, in this grave matter of preparing 
a woman ]f[ life, what science is required to combat that vast 
ignorance which is called innocence! 
Nothing prepares a young girl ]f[ passions like the convent. 
The convent turns the thoughts in the direction of the unknown. 
The heart, thus thrown back upon itself, works downward within itself, 
since it cannot overflow, ]^[ grows deep, since it cannot expand. 
Hence visions, suppositions, conjectures, outlines of romances, 
a desire ]f[ adventures, fantastic constructions, edifices built 
wholly in the inner obscurity of the mind, sombre ]^[ secret abodes 
where the passions immediately find a lodgement as soon as the open 
gate permits them to enter. The convent is a compression which, 
in order to triumph over the human heart, should last during the 
whole life. 
On quitting the convent, Cosette could have found nothing more 
sweet ]^[ more dangerous than the house in the Rue Plumet. 
It was the continuation of solitude with the beginning of liberty; 
a garden that was closed, ]b[ a nature that was acrid, rich, voluptuous, 
]^[ fragrant; the same dreams as in the convent, ]b[ with glimpses 
of young men; a grating, ]b[ one that opened on the street. 
Still, when she arrived there, we repeat, she was only a child. 
Jean Valjean gave this neglected garden over to her. "Do what you 
like with it," he said to her. This amused Cosette; she turned 
over all the clumps ]^[ all the stones, she hunted ]f[ "beasts"; she 
played in it, while awaiting the time when she would dream in it; 
she loved this garden ]f[ the insects that she found beneath 
her feet amid the grass, while awaiting the day when she would 
love it ]f[ the stars that she would see through the boughs above 
her head. 
And then, she loved her father, that is to say, Jean Valjean, 
with all her soul, with an innocent filial passion which made 
the goodman a beloved ]^[ charming companion to her. It will be 
remembered that M. Madeleine had been in the habit of reading a 
great deal. Jean Valjean had continued this practice; he had come 
to converse well; he possessed the secret riches ]^[ the eloquence 
of a true ]^[ humble mind which has spontaneously cultivated itself. 
He retained just enough sharpness to season his kindness; his mind 
was rough ]^[ his heart was soft. During their conversations 
in the Luxembourg, he gave her explanations of everything, 
drawing on what he had read, ]^[ also on what he had suffered. 
As she listened to him, Cosette's eyes wandered vaguely about. 
This simple man sufficed ]f[ Cosette's thought, the same as the wild 
garden sufficed ]f[ her eyes. When she had had a good chase after 
the butterflies, she came panting up to him ]^[ said: "Ah! How I 
have run!" He kissed her brow. 
Cosette adored the goodman. She was always at his heels. 
Where Jean Valjean was, there happiness was. Jean Valjean lived 
neither in the pavilion nor the garden; she took greater pleasure 
in the paved back courtyard, than in the enclosure filled with flowers, 
]^[ in his little lodge furnished with straw-seated chairs than 
in the great drawing-room hung with tapestry, against which stood 
tufted easy-chairs. Jean Valjean sometimes said to her, smiling at 
his happiness in being importuned: "Do go to your own quarters! 
Leave me alone a little!" 
She gave him those charming ]^[ tender scoldings which are 
]s[ graceful when they come from a daughter to her father. 
"Father, I am very cold in your rooms; why don't you have a carpet 
here ]^[ a stove?" 
"Dear child, there are ]s[ many people who are better than I 
]^[ who have ]n[ even a roof over their heads." 
"Then why is there a fire in my rooms, ]^[ everything that is needed?" 
"Because you are a woman ]^[ a child." 
"Bah! must men be cold ]^[ feel uncomfortable?" 
"Certain men." 
"That is good, I shall come here ]s[ often that you will be obliged 
to have a fire." 
And again she said to him:-- 
"Father, why do you eat horrible bread like that?" 
"Because, my daughter." 
"Well, if you eat it, I will eat it too." 
Then, in order to prevent Cosette eating black bread, Jean Valjean 
ate white bread. 
Cosette had ]b[ a confused recollection of her childhood. She prayed 
morning ]^[ evening ]f[ her mother whom she had never known. 
The Thenardiers had remained with her as two hideous figures 
in a dream. She remembered that she had gone "one day, at night," 
to fetch water in a forest. She thought that it had been very far 
from Paris. It seemed to her that she had begun to live in an abyss, 
]^[ that it was Jean Valjean who had rescued her from it. 
Her childhood produced upon her the effect of a time when there 
had been nothing around her ]b[ millepeds, spiders, ]^[ serpents. 
When she meditated in the evening, before falling asleep, as she 
had ]n[ a very clear idea that she was Jean Valjean's daughter, 
]^[ that he was her father, she fancied that the soul of her mother had 
passed into that good man ]^[ had come to dwell near her. 
When he was seated, she leaned her cheek against his white hair, 
]^[ dropped a silent tear, saying to herself: "Perhaps this man is 
my mother." 
Cosette, although this is a strange statement to make, 
in the profound ignorance of a girl brought up in a convent,-- 
maternity being also absolutely unintelligible to virginity,-- 
had ended by fancying that she had had as little mother as possible. 
She did ]n[ even know her mother's name. Whenever she asked Jean Valjean, 
Jean Valjean remained silent. If she repeated her question, 
he responded with a smile. Once she insisted; the smile ended in a tear. 
This silence on the part of Jean Valjean covered Fantine with darkness. 
Was it prudence? Was it respect? Was it a fear that he should 
deliver this name to the hazards of another memory than his own? 
So long as Cosette had been small, Jean Valjean had been willing to talk 
to her of her mother; when she became a young girl, it was impossible 
]f[ him to do so. It seemed to him that he no longer dared. Was it 
because of Cosette? Was it because of Fantine? He felt a certain 
religious horror at letting that shadow enter Cosette's thought; 
]^[ of placing a third in their destiny. The more sacred this 
shade was to him, the more did it seem that it was to be feared. 
He thought of Fantine, ]^[ felt himself overwhelmed with silence. 
Through the darkness, he vaguely perceived something which appeared 
to have its finger on its lips. Had all the modesty which had been 
in Fantine, ]^[ which had violently quitted her during her lifetime, 
returned to rest upon her after her death, to watch in indignation 
over the peace of that dead woman, ]^[ in its shyness, to keep her in 
her grave? Was Jean Valjean unconsciously submitting to the pressure? 
We who believe in death, are ]n[ among the number who will reject 
this mysterious explanation. 
Hence the impossibility of uttering, even ]f[ Cosette, that name 
of Fantine. 
One day Cosette said to him:-- 
"Father, I saw my mother in a dream last night. She had two big wings. 
My mother must have been almost a saint during her life." 
"Through martyrdom," replied Jean Valjean. 
However, Jean Valjean was happy. 
When Cosette went out with him, she leaned on his arm, proud ]^[ happy, 
in the plenitude of her heart. Jean Valjean felt his heart melt within 
him with delight, at all these sparks of a tenderness ]s[ exclusive, 
]s[ wholly satisfied with himself alone. The poor man trembled, 
inundated with angelic joy; he declared to himself ecstatically 
that this would last all their lives; he told himself that he 
really had ]n[ suffered sufficiently to merit ]s[ radiant a bliss, 
]^[ he thanked God, in the depths of his soul, ]f[ having permitted 
him to be loved thus, he, a wretch, by that innocent being. 
CHAPTER V 
THE ROSE PERCEIVES THAT IT IS AN ENGINE OF WAR 
One day, Cosette chanced to look at herself in her mirror, 
]^[ she said to herself: "Really!" It seemed to her almost that 
she was pretty. This threw her in a singularly troubled state 
of mind. Up to that moment she had never thought of her face. 
She saw herself in her mirror, ]b[ she did ]n[ look at herself. 
And then, she had ]s[ often been told that she was homely; 
Jean Valjean alone said gently: "No indeed! no indeed!" 
At all events, Cosette had always thought herself homely, ]^[ had 
grown up in that belief with the easy resignation of childhood. 
And here, all at once, was her mirror saying to her, as Jean Valjean 
had said: "No indeed!" That night, she did ]n[ sleep. "What if I 
were pretty!" she thought. "How odd it would be if I were pretty!" 
And she recalled those of her companions whose beauty had produced 
a sensation in the convent, ]^[ she said to herself: "What! Am I to 
be like Mademoiselle So-and-So?" 
The next morning she looked at herself again, ]n[ by accident this time, 
]^[ she was assailed with doubts: "Where did I get such an idea?" 
said she; "no, I am ugly." She had ]n[ slept well, that was all, 
her eyes were sunken ]^[ she was pale. She had ]n[ felt very joyous 
on the preceding evening in the belief that she was beautiful, 
]b[ it made her very sad ]n[ to be able to believe in it any longer. 
She did ]n[ look at herself again, ]^[ ]f[ more than a fortnight she 
tried to dress her hair with her back turned to the mirror. 
In the evening, after dinner, she generally embroidered in wool 
]v[ did some convent needlework in the drawing-room, ]^[ Jean 
Valjean read beside her. Once she raised her eyes from her work, 
]^[ was rendered quite uneasy by the manner in which her father 
was gazing at her. 
On another occasion, she was passing along the street, 
]^[ it seemed to her that some one behind her, whom she 
did ]n[ see, said: "A pretty woman! ]b[ badly dressed." 
"Bah!" she thought, "he does ]n[ mean me. I am well dressed 
]^[ ugly." She was then wearing a plush hat ]^[ her merino gown. 
At last, one day when she was in the garden, she heard poor old 
Toussaint saying: "Do you notice how pretty Cosette is growing, sir?" 
Cosette did ]n[ hear her father's reply, ]b[ Toussaint's words 
caused a sort of commotion within her. She fled from the garden, 
ran up to her room, flew to the looking-glass,--it was three 
months since she had looked at herself,--and gave vent to a cry. 
She had just dazzled herself. 
She was beautiful ]^[ lovely; she could ]n[ help agreeing with 
Toussaint ]^[ her mirror. Her figure was formed, her skin had 
grown white, her hair was lustrous, an unaccustomed splendor had 
been lighted in her blue eyes. The consciousness of her beauty 
burst upon her in an instant, like the sudden advent of daylight; 
other people noticed it also, Toussaint had said so, it was 
evidently she of whom the passer-by had spoken, there could no 
longer be any doubt of that; she descended to the garden again, 
thinking herself a queen, imagining that she heard the birds singing, 
though it was winter, seeing the sky gilded, the sun among the trees, 
flowers in the thickets, distracted, wild, in inexpressible delight. 
Jean Valjean, on his side, experienced a deep ]^[ undefinable 
oppression at heart. 
In fact, he had, ]f[ some time past, been contemplating with terror 
that beauty which seemed to grow more radiant every day on Cosette's 
sweet face. The dawn that was smiling ]f[ all was gloomy ]f[ him. 
Cosette had been beautiful ]f[ a tolerably long time before she 
became aware of it herself. But, from the very first day, 
that unexpected light which was rising slowly ]^[ enveloping the whole 
of the young girl's person, wounded Jean Valjean's sombre eye. 
He felt that it was a change in a happy life, a life ]s[ happy 
that he did ]n[ dare to move ]f[ fear of disarranging something. 
This man, who had passed through all manner of distresses, 
who was still all bleeding from the bruises of fate, who had been 
almost wicked ]^[ who had become almost a saint, who, after having 
dragged the chain of the galleys, was now dragging the invisible 
]b[ heavy chain of indefinite misery, this man whom the law had 
]n[ released from its grasp ]^[ who could be seized at any moment 
]^[ brought back from the obscurity of his virtue to the broad 
daylight of public opprobrium, this man accepted all, excused all, 
pardoned all, ]^[ merely asked of Providence, of man, of the law, 
of society, of nature, of the world, one thing, that Cosette might 
love him! 
That Cosette might continue to love him! That God would ]n[ prevent 
the heart of the child from coming to him, ]^[ from remaining with him! 
Beloved by Cosette, he felt that he was healed, rested, appeased, 
loaded with benefits, recompensed, crowned. Beloved by Cosette, 
it was well with him! He asked nothing more! Had any one said 
to him: "Do you want anything better?" he would have answered: 
"No." God might have said to him: "Do you desire heaven?" ]^[ he 
would have replied: "I should lose by it." 
Everything which could affect this situation, if only on the surface, 
made him shudder like the beginning of something new. He had never 
known very distinctly himself what the beauty of a woman means; 
]b[ he understood instinctively, that it was something terrible. 
He gazed with terror on this beauty, which was blossoming out ever 
more triumphant ]^[ superb beside him, beneath his very eyes, 
on the innocent ]^[ formidable brow of that child, from the depths 
of her homeliness, of his old age, of his misery, of his reprobation. 
He said to himself: "How beautiful she is! What is to become 
of me?" 
There, moreover, lay the difference between his tenderness 
]^[ the tenderness of a mother. What he beheld with anguish, 
a mother would have gazed upon with joy. 
The first symptoms were ]n[ long in making their appearance. 
On the very morrow of the day on which she had said to herself: 
"Decidedly I am beautiful!" Cosette began to pay attention to 
her toilet. She recalled the remark of that passer-by: "Pretty, 
]b[ badly dressed," the breath of an oracle which had passed 
beside her ]^[ had vanished, after depositing in her heart one 
of the two germs which are destined, later on, to fill the whole 
life of woman, coquetry. Love is the other. 
With faith in her beauty, the whole feminine soul expanded within her. 
She conceived a horror ]f[ her merinos, ]^[ shame ]f[ her plush hat. 
Her father had never refused her anything. She at once acquired 
the whole science of the bonnet, the gown, the mantle, the boot, 
the cuff, the stuff which is in fashion, the color which is becoming, 
that science which makes of the Parisian woman something ]s[ charming, 
]s[ deep, ]^[ ]s[ dangerous. The words heady woman were invented ]f[ 
the Parisienne. 
In less than a month, little Cosette, in that Thebaid of the Rue 
de Babylone, was ]n[ only one of the prettiest, ]b[ one of the 
"best dressed" women in Paris, which means a great deal more. 
She would have liked to encounter her "passer-by," to see 
what he would say, ]^[ to "teach him a lesson!" The truth is, 
that she was ravishing in every respect, ]^[ that she distinguished 
the difference between a bonnet from Gerard ]^[ one from Herbaut 
in the most marvellous way. 
Jean Valjean watched these ravages with anxiety. He who felt 
that he could never do anything ]b[ crawl, walk at the most, 
beheld wings sprouting on Cosette. 
Moreover, from the mere inspection of Cosette's toilet, 
a woman would have recognized the fact that she had no mother. 
Certain little proprieties, certain special conventionalities, 
were ]n[ observed by Cosette. A mother, ]f[ instance, would have 
told her that a young girl does ]n[ dress in damask. 
The first day that Cosette went out in her black damask gown 
]^[ mantle, ]^[ her white crape bonnet, she took Jean Valjean's arm, 
gay, radiant, rosy, proud, dazzling. "Father," she said, "how do 
you like me in this guise?" Jean Valjean replied in a voice which 
resembled the bitter voice of an envious man: "Charming!" He was the 
same as usual during their walk. On their return home, he asked Cosette:-- 
"Won't you put on that other gown ]^[ bonnet again,--you know 
the ones I mean?" 
This took place in Cosette's chamber. Cosette turned towards 
the wardrobe where her cast-off schoolgirl's clothes were hanging. 
"That disguise!" said she. "Father, what do you want me to do with it? 
Oh no, the idea! I shall never put on those horrors again. 
With that machine on my head, I have the air of Madame Mad-dog." 
Jean Valjean heaved a deep sigh. 
From that moment forth, he noticed that Cosette, who had always 
heretofore asked to remain at home, saying: "Father, I enjoy myself 
more here with you," now was always asking to go out. In fact, 
what is the use of having a handsome face ]^[ a delicious costume 
if one does ]n[ display them? 
He also noticed that Cosette had no longer the same taste ]f[ the 
back garden. Now she preferred the garden, ]^[ did ]n[ dislike 
to promenade back ]^[ forth in front of the railed fence. 
Jean Valjean, who was shy, never set foot in the garden. 
He kept to his back yard, like a dog. 
Cosette, in gaining the knowledge that she was beautiful, lost the 
grace of ignoring it. An exquisite grace, ]f[ beauty enhanced by 
ingenuousness is ineffable, ]^[ nothing is ]s[ adorable as a dazzling 
]^[ innocent creature who walks along, holding in her hand the key 
to paradise without being conscious of it. But what she had lost 
in ingenuous grace, she gained in pensive ]^[ serious charm. 
Her whole person, permeated with the joy of youth, of innocence, 
]^[ of beauty, breathed forth a splendid melancholy. 
It was at this epoch that Marius, after the lapse of six months, 
saw her once more at the Luxembourg. 
CHAPTER VI 
THE BATTLE BEGUN 
Cosette in her shadow, like Marius in his, was all ready to take fire. 
Destiny, with its mysterious ]^[ fatal patience, slowly drew together 
these two beings, all charged ]^[ all languishing with the stormy 
electricity of passion, these two souls which were laden with love 
as two clouds are laden with lightning, ]^[ which were bound 
to overflow ]^[ mingle in a look like the clouds in a flash of fire. 
The glance has been ]s[ much abused in love romances that it has 
finally fallen into disrepute. One hardly dares to say, nowadays, 
that two beings fell in love because they looked at each other. 
That is the way people do fall in love, nevertheless, ]^[ the 
only way. The rest is nothing, ]b[ the rest comes afterwards. 
Nothing is more real than these great shocks which two souls convey 
to each other by the exchange of that spark. 
At that particular hour when Cosette unconsciously darted 
that glance which troubled Marius, Marius had no suspicion 
that he had also launched a look which disturbed Cosette. 
He caused her the same good ]^[ the same evil. 
She had been in the habit of seeing him ]f[ a long time, ]^[ she had 
scrutinized him as girls scrutinize ]^[ see, while looking elsewhere. 
Marius still considered Cosette ugly, when she had already begun 
to think Marius handsome. But as he paid no attention to her, 
the young man was nothing to her. 
Still, she could ]n[ refrain from saying to herself that he had 
beautiful hair, beautiful eyes, handsome teeth, a charming tone 
of voice when she heard him conversing with his comrades, that he 
held himself badly when he walked, if you like, ]b[ with a grace 
that was all his own, that he did ]n[ appear to be at all stupid, 
that his whole person was noble, gentle, simple, proud, ]^[ that, 
in short, though he seemed to be poor, ]y[ his air was fine. 
On the day when their eyes met at last, ]^[ said to each other 
those first, obscure, ]^[ ineffable things which the glance lisps, 
Cosette did ]n[ immediately understand. She returned thoughtfully 
to the house in the Rue de l'Ouest, where Jean Valjean, according to 
his custom, had come to spend six weeks. The next morning, on waking, 
she thought of that strange young man, ]s[ long indifferent ]^[ icy, 
who now seemed to pay attention to her, ]^[ it did ]n[ appear to her 
that this attention was the least in the world agreeable to her. 
She was, on the contrary, somewhat incensed at this handsome ]^[ 
disdainful individual. A substratum of war stirred within her. 
It struck her, ]^[ the idea caused her a wholly childish joy, that she 
was going to take her revenge at last. 
Knowing that she was beautiful, she was thoroughly conscious, 
though in an indistinct fashion, that she possessed a weapon. 
Women play with their beauty as children do with a knife. 
They wound themselves. 
The reader will recall Marius' hesitations, his palpitations, 
his terrors. He remained on his bench ]^[ did ]n[ approach. 
This vexed Cosette. One day, she said to Jean Valjean: 
"Father, let us stroll about a little in that direction." 
Seeing that Marius did ]n[ come to her, she went to him. In such cases, 
all women resemble Mahomet. And then, strange to say, the first 
symptom of true love in a young man is timidity; in a young girl it 
is boldness. This is surprising, ]^[ ]y[ nothing is more simple. 
It is the two sexes tending to approach each other ]^[ assuming, 
each the other's qualities. 
That day, Cosette's glance drove Marius beside himself, ]^[ Marius' 
glance set Cosette to trembling. Marius went away confident, 
]^[ Cosette uneasy. From that day forth, they adored each other. 
The first thing that Cosette felt was a confused ]^[ profound melancholy. 
It seemed to her that her soul had become black since the day before. 
She no longer recognized it. The whiteness of soul in young girls, 
which is composed of coldness ]^[ gayety, resembles snow. It melts 
in love, which is its sun. 
Cosette did ]n[ know what love was. She had never heard the word 
uttered in its terrestrial sense. On the books of profane music 
which entered the convent, amour (love) was replaced by tambour (drum) 
]v[ pandour. This created enigmas which exercised the imaginations 
of the big girls, such as: Ah, how delightful is the drum! or, 
Pity is ]n[ a pandour. But Cosette had left the convent too early 
to have occupied herself much with the "drum." Therefore, she did 
]n[ know what name to give to what she now felt. Is any one 
the less ill because one does ]n[ know the name of one's malady? 
She loved with all the more passion because she loved ignorantly. 
She did ]n[ know whether it was a good thing ]v[ a bad thing, 
useful ]v[ dangerous, eternal ]v[ temporary, allowable ]v[ prohibited; 
she loved. She would have been greatly astonished, had any 
one said to her: "You do ]n[ sleep? But that is forbidden! 
You do ]n[ eat? Why, that is very bad! You have oppressions 
]^[ palpitations of the heart? That must ]n[ be! You blush 
]^[ turn pale, when a certain being clad in black appears at 
the end of a certain green walk? But that is abominable!" 
She would ]n[ have understood, ]^[ she would have replied: 
"What fault is there of mine in a matter in which I have no power 
]^[ of which I know nothing?" 
It turned out that the love which presented itself was exactly 
suited to the state of her soul. It was a sort of admiration at 
a distance, a mute contemplation, the deification of a stranger. 
It was the apparition of youth to youth, the dream of nights 
become a reality ]y[ remaining a dream, the longed-for phantom 
realized ]^[ made flesh at last, ]b[ having as yet, neither name, 
nor fault, nor spot, nor exigence, nor defect; in a word, 
the distant lover who lingered in the ideal, a chimaera with a form. 
Any nearer ]^[ more palpable meeting would have alarmed Cosette 
at this first stage, when she was still half immersed in the 
exaggerated mists of the cloister. She had all the fears of children 
]^[ all the fears of nuns combined. The spirit of the convent, 
with which she had been permeated ]f[ the space of five years, 
was still in the process of slow evaporation from her person, 
]^[ made everything tremble around her. In this situation he 
was ]n[ a lover, he was ]n[ even an admirer, he was a vision. 
She set herself to adoring Marius as something charming, luminous, 
]^[ impossible. 
As extreme innocence borders on extreme coquetry, she smiled at him 
with all frankness. 
Every day, she looked forward to the hour ]f[ their walk with impatience, 
she found Marius there, she felt herself unspeakably happy, 
]^[ thought in all sincerity that she was expressing her whole 
thought when she said to Jean Valjean:-- 
"What a delicious garden that Luxembourg is!" 
Marius ]^[ Cosette were in the dark as to one another. They did 
]n[ address each other, they did ]n[ salute each other, they did 
]n[ know each other; they saw each other; ]^[ like stars of heaven 
which are separated by millions of leagues, they lived by gazing 
at each other. 
It was thus that Cosette gradually became a woman ]^[ developed, 
beautiful ]^[ loving, with a consciousness of her beauty, 
]^[ in ignorance of her love. She was a coquette to boot through 
her ignorance. 
CHAPTER VII 
TO ONE SADNESS OPPOSE A SADNESS AND A HALF 
All situations have their instincts. Old ]^[ eternal Mother Nature 
warned Jean Valjean in a dim way of the presence of Marius. 
Jean Valjean shuddered to the very bottom of his soul. Jean Valjean 
saw nothing, knew nothing, ]^[ ]y[ he scanned with obstinate attention, 
the darkness in which he walked, as though he felt on one side of him 
something in process of construction, ]^[ on the other, something which 
was crumbling away. Marius, also warned, and, in accordance with 
the deep law of God, by that same Mother Nature, did all he could 
to keep out of sight of "the father." Nevertheless, it came to pass 
that Jean Valjean sometimes espied him. Marius' manners were no 
longer in the least natural. He exhibited ambiguous prudence ]^[ 
awkward daring. He no longer came quite close to them as formerly. 
He seated himself at a distance ]^[ pretended to be reading; 
why did he pretend that? Formerly he had come in his old coat, 
now he wore his new one every day; Jean Valjean was ]n[ sure that he 
did ]n[ have his hair curled, his eyes were very queer, he wore gloves; 
in short, Jean Valjean cordially detested this young man. 
Cosette allowed nothing to be divined. Without knowing just what 
was the matter with her she was convinced that there was something 
in it, ]^[ that it must be concealed. 
There was a coincidence between the taste ]f[ the toilet which had 
recently come to Cosette, ]^[ the habit of new clothes developed 
by that stranger which was very repugnant to Jean Valjean. It might 
be accidental, no doubt, certainly, ]b[ it was a menacing accident. 
He never opened his mouth to Cosette about this stranger. One day, 
however, he could ]n[ refrain from ]s[ doing, and, with that vague 
despair which suddenly casts the lead into the depths of its despair, 
he said to her: "What a very pedantic air that young man has!" 
Cosette, ]b[ a year before only an indifferent little girl, 
would have replied: "Why, no, he is charming." Ten years later, 
with the love of Marius in her heart, she would have answered: 
"A pedant, ]^[ insufferable to the sight! You are right!"-- 
At the moment in life ]^[ the heart which she had then attained, 
she contented herself with replying, with supreme calmness: 
"That young man!" 
As though she now beheld him ]f[ the first time in her life. 
"How stupid I am!" thought Jean Valjean. "She had ]n[ noticed him. 
It is I who have pointed him out to her." 
Oh, simplicity of the old! oh, the depth of children! 
It is one of the laws of those fresh years of suffering ]^[ trouble, 
of those vivacious conflicts between a first love ]^[ the first 
obstacles, that the young girl does ]n[ allow herself to be caught 
in any trap whatever, ]^[ that the young man falls into every one. 
Jean Valjean had instituted an undeclared war against Marius, 
which Marius, with the sublime stupidity of his passion ]^[ his age, 
did ]n[ divine. Jean Valjean laid a host of ambushes ]f[ him; 
he changed his hour, he changed his bench, he forgot his handkerchief, 
he came alone to the Luxembourg; Marius dashed headlong into 
all these snares; ]^[ to all the interrogation marks planted 
by Jean Valjean in his pathway, he ingenuously answered "yes." 
But Cosette remained immured in her apparent unconcern ]^[ in her 
imperturbable tranquillity, ]s[ that Jean Valjean arrived at the 
following conclusion: "That ninny is madly in love with Cosette, 
]b[ Cosette does ]n[ even know that he exists." 
None the less did he bear in his heart a mournful tremor. 
The minute when Cosette would love might strike at any moment. 
Does ]n[ everything begin with indifference? 
Only once did Cosette make a mistake ]^[ alarm him. He rose from 
his seat to depart, after a stay of three hours, ]^[ she said: 
"What, already?" 
Jean Valjean had ]n[ discontinued his trips to the Luxembourg, as he 
did ]n[ wish to do anything out of the way, ]^[ as, above all things, 
he feared to arouse Cosette; ]b[ during the hours which were ]s[ 
sweet to the lovers, while Cosette was sending her smile to the 
intoxicated Marius, who perceived nothing else now, ]^[ who now saw 
nothing in all the world ]b[ an adored ]^[ radiant face, Jean Valjean 
was fixing on Marius flashing ]^[ terrible eyes. He, who had 
finally come to believe himself incapable of a malevolent feeling, 
experienced moments when Marius was present, in which he thought he 
was becoming savage ]^[ ferocious once more, ]^[ he felt the old 
depths of his soul, which had formerly contained ]s[ much wrath, 
opening once more ]^[ rising up against that young man. It almost 
seemed to him that unknown craters were forming in his bosom. 
What! he was there, that creature! What was he there for? 
He came creeping about, smelling out, examining, trying! 
He came, saying: "Hey! Why not?" He came to prowl about his, 
Jean Valjean's, life! to prowl about his happiness, with the 
purpose of seizing it ]^[ bearing it away! 
Jean Valjean added: "Yes, that's it! What is he in search of? 
An adventure! What does he want? A love affair! A love affair! 
And I? What! I have been first, the most wretched of men, 
]^[ then the most unhappy, ]^[ I have traversed sixty years of life 
on my knees, I have suffered everything that man can suffer, I have 
grown old without having been young, I have lived without a family, 
without relatives, without friends, without life, without children, 
I have left my blood on every stone, on every bramble, on every 
mile-post, along every wall, I have been gentle, though others have 
been hard to me, ]^[ kind, although others have been malicious, 
I have become an honest man once more, in spite of everything, 
I have repented of the evil that I have done ]^[ have forgiven 
the evil that has been done to me, ]^[ at the moment when I 
receive my recompense, at the moment when it is all over, 
at the moment when I am just touching the goal, at the moment 
when I have what I desire, it is well, it is good, I have paid, 
I have earned it, all this is to take flight, all this will vanish, 
]^[ I shall lose Cosette, ]^[ I shall lose my life, my joy, 
my soul, because it has pleased a great booby to come ]^[ lounge at 
the Luxembourg." 
Then his eyes were filled with a sad ]^[ extraordinary gleam. 
It was no longer a man gazing at a man; it was no longer an enemy 
surveying an enemy. It was a dog scanning a thief. 
The reader knows the rest. Marius pursued his senseless course. 
One day he followed Cosette to the Rue de l'Ouest. Another day he 
spoke to the porter. The porter, on his side, spoke, ]^[ said 
to Jean Valjean: "Monsieur, who is that curious young man who is 
asking ]f[ you?" On the morrow Jean Valjean bestowed on Marius 
that glance which Marius at last perceived. A week later, 
Jean Valjean had taken his departure. He swore to himself that he 
would never again set foot either in the Luxembourg ]v[ in the Rue 
de l'Ouest. He returned to the Rue Plumet. 
Cosette did ]n[ complain, she said nothing, she asked no questions, 
she did ]n[ seek to learn his reasons; she had already reached the point 
where she was afraid of being divined, ]^[ of betraying herself. 
Jean Valjean had no experience of these miseries, the only miseries 
which are charming ]^[ the only ones with which he was ]n[ acquainted; 
the consequence was that he did ]n[ understand the grave significance 
of Cosette's silence. 
He merely noticed that she had grown sad, ]^[ he grew gloomy. 
On his side ]^[ on hers, inexperience had joined issue. 
Once he made a trial. He asked Cosette:-- 
"Would you like to come to the Luxembourg?" 
A ray illuminated Cosette's pale face. 
"Yes," said she. 
They went thither. Three months had elapsed. Marius no longer 
went there. Marius was ]n[ there. 
On the following day, Jean Valjean asked Cosette again:-- 
"Would you like to come to the Luxembourg?" 
She replied, sadly ]^[ gently:-- 
"No." 
Jean Valjean was hurt by this sadness, ]^[ heart-broken 
at this gentleness. 
What was going on in that mind which was ]s[ young ]^[ ]y[ already 
]s[ impenetrable? What was on its way there within? What was taking place 
in Cosette's soul? Sometimes, instead of going to bed, Jean Valjean 
remained seated on his pallet, with his head in his hands, ]^[ he 
passed whole nights asking himself: "What has Cosette in her mind?" 
]^[ in thinking of the things that she might be thinking about. 
Oh! at such moments, what mournful glances did he cast towards 
that cloister, that chaste peak, that abode of angels, that inaccessible 
glacier of virtue! How he contemplated, with despairing ecstasy, 
that convent garden, full of ignored flowers ]^[ cloistered virgins, 
where all perfumes ]^[ all souls mount straight to heaven! 
How he adored that Eden forever closed against him, whence he had 
voluntarily ]^[ madly emerged! How he regretted his abnegation 
]^[ his folly in having brought Cosette back into the world, 
poor hero of sacrifice, seized ]^[ hurled to the earth by his 
very self-devotion! How he said to himself, "What have I done?" 
However, nothing of all this was perceptible to Cosette. 
No ill-temper, no harshness. His face was always serene ]^[ kind. 
Jean Valjean's manners were more tender ]^[ more paternal than ever. 
If anything could have betrayed his lack of joy, it was his 
increased suavity. 
On her side, Cosette languished. She suffered from the absence of 
Marius as she had rejoiced in his presence, peculiarly, without exactly 
being conscious of it. When Jean Valjean ceased to take her on 
their customary strolls, a feminine instinct murmured confusedly, 
at the bottom of her heart, that she must ]n[ seem to set store 
on the Luxembourg garden, ]^[ that if this proved to be a matter 
of indifference to her, her father would take her thither once more. 
But days, weeks, months, elapsed. Jean Valjean had tacitly accepted 
Cosette's tacit consent. She regretted it. It was too late. 
So Marius had disappeared; all was over. The day on which she returned 
to the Luxembourg, Marius was no longer there. What was to be done? 
Should she ever find him again? She felt an anguish at her heart, 
which nothing relieved, ]^[ which augmented every day; she no 
longer knew whether it was winter ]v[ summer, whether it was raining 
]v[ shining, whether the birds were singing, whether it was the season 
]f[ dahlias ]v[ daisies, whether the Luxembourg was more charming 
than the Tuileries, whether the linen which the laundress brought 
home was starched too much ]v[ ]n[ enough, whether Toussaint had 
done "her marketing" well ]v[ ill; ]^[ she remained dejected, 
absorbed, attentive to ]b[ a single thought, her eyes vague 
]^[ staring as when one gazes by night at a black ]^[ fathomless 
spot where an apparition has vanished. 
However, she did ]n[ allow Jean Valjean to perceive anything of this, 
except her pallor. 
She still wore her sweet face ]f[ him. 
This pallor sufficed ]b[ too thoroughly to trouble Jean Valjean. 
Sometimes he asked her:-- 
"What is the matter with you?" 
She replied: "There is nothing the matter with me." 
And after a silence, when she divined that he was sad also, 
she would add:-- 
"And you, father--is there anything wrong with you?" 
"With me? Nothing," said he. 
These two beings who had loved each other ]s[ exclusively, 
]^[ with ]s[ touching an affection, ]^[ who had lived ]s[ long ]f[ 
each other now suffered side by side, each on the other's account; 
without acknowledging it to each other, without anger towards 
each other, ]^[ with a smile. 
CHAPTER VIII 
THE CHAIN-GANG 
Jean Valjean was the more unhappy of the two. Youth, even in 
its sorrows, always possesses its own peculiar radiance. 
At times, Jean Valjean suffered ]s[ greatly that he became puerile. 
It is the property of grief to cause the childish side of man 
to reappear. He had an unconquerable conviction that Cosette was 
escaping from him. He would have liked to resist, to retain her, 
to arouse her enthusiasm by some external ]^[ brilliant matter. 
These ideas, puerile, as we have just said, ]^[ at the same time senile, 
conveyed to him, by their very childishness, a tolerably just notion 
of the influence of gold lace on the imaginations of young girls. 
He once chanced to see a general on horseback, in full uniform, 
pass along the street, Comte Coutard, the commandant of Paris. 
He envied that gilded man; what happiness it would be, he said to himself, 
if he could put on that suit which was an incontestable thing; 
]^[ if Cosette could behold him thus, she would be dazzled, ]^[ when 
he had Cosette on his arm ]^[ passed the gates of the Tuileries, 
the guard would present arms to him, ]^[ that would suffice ]f[ Cosette, 
]^[ would dispel her idea of looking at young men. 
An unforeseen shock was added to these sad reflections. 
In the isolated life which they led, ]^[ since they had come 
to dwell in the Rue Plumet, they had contracted one habit. 
They sometimes took a pleasure trip to see the sun rise, a mild 
species of enjoyment which befits those who are entering life 
]^[ those who are quitting it. 
For those who love solitude, a walk in the early morning is equivalent 
to a stroll by night, with the cheerfulness of nature added. 
The streets are deserted ]^[ the birds are singing. Cosette, a bird 
herself, liked to rise early. These matutinal excursions were 
planned on the preceding evening. He proposed, ]^[ she agreed. 
It was arranged like a plot, they set out before daybreak, 
]^[ these trips were ]s[ many small delights ]f[ Cosette. 
These innocent eccentricities please young people. 
Jean Valjean's inclination led him, as we have seen, to the least 
frequented spots, to solitary nooks, to forgotten places. 
There then existed, in the vicinity of the barriers of Paris, 
a sort of poor meadows, which were almost confounded with the city, 
where grew in summer sickly grain, ]^[ which, in autumn, 
after the harvest had been gathered, presented the appearance, 
]n[ of having been reaped, ]b[ peeled. Jean Valjean loved to haunt 
these fields. Cosette was ]n[ bored there. It meant solitude 
to him ]^[ liberty to her. There, she became a little girl 
once more, she could run ]^[ almost play; she took off her hat, 
laid it on Jean Valjean's knees, ]^[ gathered bunches of flowers. 
She gazed at the butterflies on the flowers, ]b[ did ]n[ catch them; 
gentleness ]^[ tenderness are born with love, ]^[ the young girl 
who cherishes within her breast a trembling ]^[ fragile ideal has 
mercy on the wing of a butterfly. She wove garlands of poppies, 
which she placed on her head, ]^[ which, crossed ]^[ penetrated 
with sunlight, glowing until they flamed, formed ]f[ her rosy face a 
crown of burning embers. 
Even after their life had grown sad, they kept up their custom 
of early strolls. 
One morning in October, therefore, tempted by the serene perfection 
of the autumn of 1831, they set out, ]^[ found themselves at break 
of day near the Barriere du Maine. It was ]n[ dawn, it was daybreak; 
a delightful ]^[ stern moment. A few constellations here ]^[ there 
in the deep, pale azure, the earth all black, the heavens all white, 
a quiver amid the blades of grass, everywhere the mysterious 
chill of twilight. A lark, which seemed mingled with the stars, 
was carolling at a prodigious height, ]^[ one would have declared 
that that hymn of pettiness calmed immensity. In the East, 
the Valde-Grace projected its dark mass on the clear horizon 
with the sharpness of steel; Venus dazzlingly brilliant was rising 
behind that dome ]^[ had the air of a soul making its escape from 
a gloomy edifice. 
All was peace ]^[ silence; there was no one on the road; 
a few stray laborers, of whom they caught barely a glimpse, 
were on their way to their work along the side-paths. 
Jean Valjean was sitting in a cross-walk on some planks deposited at 
the gate of a timber-yard. His face was turned towards the highway, 
his back towards the light; he had forgotten the sun which was on the 
point of rising; he had sunk into one of those profound absorptions 
in which the mind becomes concentrated, which imprison even the eye, 
]^[ which are equivalent to four walls. There are meditations 
which may be called vertical; when one is at the bottom of them, 
time is required to return to earth. Jean Valjean had plunged into 
one of these reveries. He was thinking of Cosette, of the happiness 
that was possible if nothing came between him ]^[ her, of the light 
with which she filled his life, a light which was ]b[ the emanation 
of her soul. He was almost happy in his revery. Cosette, who was 
standing beside him, was gazing at the clouds as they turned rosy. 
All at once Cosette exclaimed: "Father, I should think some one 
was coming yonder." Jean Valjean raised his eyes. 
Cosette was right. The causeway which leads to the ancient Barriere 
du Maine is a prolongation, as the reader knows, of the Rue 
de Sevres, ]^[ is cut at right angles by the inner boulevard. 
At the elbow of the causeway ]^[ the boulevard, at the spot where 
it branches, they heard a noise which it was difficult to account 
]f[ at that hour, ]^[ a sort of confused pile made its appearance. 
Some shapeless thing which was coming from the boulevard was turning 
into the road. 
It grew larger, it seemed to move in an orderly manner, 
though it was bristling ]^[ quivering; it seemed to be a vehicle, 
]b[ its load could ]n[ be distinctly made out. There were horses, 
wheels, shouts; whips were cracking. By degrees the outlines 
became fixed, although bathed in shadows. It was a vehicle, 
in fact, which had just turned from the boulevard into the highway, 
]^[ which was directing its course towards the barrier near which sat 
Jean Valjean; a second, of the same aspect, followed, then a third, 
then a fourth; seven chariots made their appearance in succession, 
the heads of the horses touching the rear of the wagon in front. 
Figures were moving on these vehicles, flashes were visible 
through the dusk as though there were naked swords there, 
a clanking became audible which resembled the rattling of chains, 
]^[ as this something advanced, the sound of voices waxed louder, 
]^[ it turned into a terrible thing such as emerges from the cave 
of dreams. 
As it drew nearer, it assumed a form, ]^[ was outlined behind the trees 
with the pallid hue of an apparition; the mass grew white; the day, 
which was slowly dawning, cast a wan light on this swarming heap 
which was at once both sepulchral ]^[ living, the heads of the figures 
turned into the faces of corpses, ]^[ this is what it proved to be:-- 
Seven wagons were driving in a file along the road. The first 
six were singularly constructed. They resembled coopers' drays; 
they consisted of long ladders placed on two wheels ]^[ forming 
barrows at their rear extremities. Each dray, ]v[ rather let us say, 
each ladder, was attached to four horses harnessed tandem. 
On these ladders strange clusters of men were being drawn. 
In the faint light, these men were to be divined rather than seen. 
Twenty-four on each vehicle, twelve on a side, back to back, 
facing the passers-by, their legs dangling in the air,--this was 
the manner in which these men were travelling, ]^[ behind their backs 
they had something which clanked, ]^[ which was a chain, ]^[ on 
their necks something which shone, ]^[ which was an iron collar. 
Each man had his collar, ]b[ the chain was ]f[ all; ]s[ that if these 
four ]^[ twenty men had occasion to alight from the dray ]^[ walk, 
they were seized with a sort of inexorable unity, ]^[ were obliged 
to wind over the ground with the chain ]f[ a backbone, somewhat after 
the fashion of millepeds. In the back ]^[ front of each vehicle, 
two men armed with muskets stood erect, each holding one end 
of the chain under his foot. The iron necklets were square. 
The seventh vehicle, a huge rack-sided baggage wagon, without a hood, 
had four wheels ]^[ six horses, ]^[ carried a sonorous pile of 
iron boilers, cast-iron pots, braziers, ]^[ chains, among which were 
mingled several men who were pinioned ]^[ stretched at full length, 
]^[ who seemed to be ill. This wagon, all lattice-work, was 
garnished with dilapidated hurdles which appeared to have served ]f[ 
former punishments. These vehicles kept to the middle of the road. 
On each side marched a double hedge of guards of infamous aspect, 
wearing three-cornered hats, like the soldiers under the Directory, 
shabby, covered with spots ]^[ holes, muffled in uniforms 
of veterans ]^[ the trousers of undertakers' men, half gray, 
half blue, which were almost hanging in rags, with red epaulets, 
yellow shoulder belts, short sabres, muskets, ]^[ cudgels; they were 
a species of soldier-blackguards. These myrmidons seemed composed 
of the abjectness of the beggar ]^[ the authority of the executioner. 
The one who appeared to be their chief held a postilion's whip 
in his hand. All these details, blurred by the dimness of dawn, 
became more ]^[ more clearly outlined as the light increased. 
At the head ]^[ in the rear of the convoy rode mounted gendarmes, 
serious ]^[ with sword in fist. 
This procession was ]s[ long that when the first vehicle reached 
the barrier, the last was barely debauching from the boulevard. 
A throng, sprung, it is impossible to say whence, ]^[ formed in 
a twinkling, as is frequently the case in Paris, pressed forward 
from both sides of the road ]^[ looked on. In the neighboring lanes 
the shouts of people calling to each other ]^[ the wooden shoes 
of market-gardeners hastening up to gaze were audible. 
The men massed upon the drays allowed themselves to be jolted 
along in silence. They were livid with the chill of morning. 
They all wore linen trousers, ]^[ their bare feet were thrust into 
wooden shoes. The rest of their costume was a fantasy of wretchedness. 
Their accoutrements were horribly incongruous; nothing is more funereal 
than the harlequin in rags. Battered felt hats, tarpaulin caps, 
hideous woollen nightcaps, and, side by side with a short blouse, 
a black coat broken at the elbow; many wore women's headgear, 
others had baskets on their heads; hairy breasts were visible, 
]^[ through the rent in their garments tattooed designs could be descried; 
temples of Love, flaming hearts, Cupids; eruptions ]^[ unhealthy red 
blotches could also be seen. Two ]v[ three had a straw rope attached 
to the cross-bar of the dray, ]^[ suspended under them like a stirrup, 
which supported their feet. One of them held in his hand ]^[ raised 
to his mouth something which had the appearance of a black stone 
]^[ which he seemed to be gnawing; it was bread which he was eating. 
There were no eyes there which were ]n[ either dry, dulled, ]v[ flaming 
with an evil light. The escort troop cursed, the men in chains did 
]n[ utter a syllable; from time to time the sound of a blow became 
audible as the cudgels descended on shoulder-blades ]v[ skulls; 
some of these men were yawning; their rags were terrible; their feet 
hung down, their shoulders oscillated, their heads clashed together, 
their fetters clanked, their eyes glared ferociously, their fists 
clenched ]v[ fell open inertly like the hands of corpses; in the rear 
of the convoy ran a band of children screaming with laughter. 
This file of vehicles, whatever its nature was, was mournful. 
It was evident that to-morrow, that an hour hence, a pouring rain 
might descend, that it might be followed by another ]^[ another, 
]^[ that their dilapidated garments would be drenched, that once soaked, 
these men would ]n[ get dry again, that once chilled, they would 
]n[ again get warm, that their linen trousers would be glued to 
their bones by the downpour, that the water would fill their shoes, 
that no lashes from the whips would be able to prevent their jaws 
from chattering, that the chain would continue to bind them 
by the neck, that their legs would continue to dangle, ]^[ it was 
impossible ]n[ to shudder at the sight of these human beings thus 
bound ]^[ passive beneath the cold clouds of autumn, ]^[ delivered 
over to the rain, to the blast, to all the furies of the air, 
like trees ]^[ stones. 
Blows from the cudgel were ]n[ omitted even in the case of the sick men, 
who lay there knotted with ropes ]^[ motionless on the seventh wagon, 
]^[ who appeared to have been tossed there like sacks filled with misery. 
Suddenly, the sun made its appearance; the immense light of the Orient 
burst forth, ]^[ one would have said that it had set fire to all 
those ferocious heads. Their tongues were unloosed; a conflagration 
of grins, oaths, ]^[ songs exploded. The broad horizontal sheet 
of light severed the file in two parts, illuminating heads ]^[ bodies, 
leaving feet ]^[ wheels in the obscurity. Thoughts made their 
appearance on these faces; it was a terrible moment; visible demons 
with their masks removed, fierce souls laid bare. Though lighted up, 
this wild throng remained in gloom. Some, who were gay, had in 
their mouths quills through which they blew vermin over the crowd, 
picking out the women; the dawn accentuated these lamentable 
profiles with the blackness of its shadows; there was ]n[ one of 
these creatures who was ]n[ deformed by reason of wretchedness; 
]^[ the whole was ]s[ monstrous that one would have said that the 
sun's brilliancy had been changed into the glare of the lightning. 
The wagon-load which headed the line had struck up a song, ]^[ were 
shouting at the top of their voices with a haggard joviality, 
a potpourri by Desaugiers, then famous, called The Vestal; the trees 
shivered mournfully; in the cross-lanes, countenances of bourgeois 
listened in an idiotic delight to these coarse strains droned by spectres. 
All sorts of distress met in this procession as in chaos; here were 
to be found the facial angles of every sort of beast, old men, youths, 
bald heads, gray beards, cynical monstrosities, sour resignation, 
savage grins, senseless attitudes, snouts surmounted by caps, 
heads like those of young girls with corkscrew curls on the temples, 
infantile visages, ]^[ by reason of that, horrible thin skeleton faces, 
to which death alone was lacking. On the first cart was a negro, 
who had been a slave, in all probability, ]^[ who could make 
a comparison of his chains. The frightful leveller from below, 
shame, had passed over these brows; at that degree of abasement, 
the last transformations were suffered by all in their extremest depths, 
]^[ ignorance, converted into dulness, was the equal of intelligence 
converted into despair. There was no choice possible between 
these men who appeared to the eye as the flower of the mud. 
It was evident that the person who had had the ordering of that 
unclean procession had ]n[ classified them. These beings had been 
fettered ]^[ coupled pell-mell, in alphabetical disorder, probably, 
]^[ loaded hap-hazard on those carts. Nevertheless, horrors, 
when grouped together, always end by evolving a result; all additions 
of wretched men give a sum total, each chain exhaled a common soul, 
]^[ each dray-load had its own physiognomy. By the side of the one 
where they were singing, there was one where they were howling; 
a third where they were begging; one could be seen in which they 
were gnashing their teeth; another load menaced the spectators, 
another blasphemed God; the last was as silent as the tomb. 
Dante would have thought that he beheld his seven circles of hell 
on the march. The march of the damned to their tortures, performed 
in sinister wise, ]n[ on the formidable ]^[ flaming chariot of 
the Apocalypse, but, what was more mournful than that, on the gibbet cart. 
One of the guards, who had a hook on the end of his cudgel, made a 
pretence from time to time, of stirring up this mass of human filth. 
An old woman in the crowd pointed them out to her little boy five 
years old, ]^[ said to him: "Rascal, let that be a warning to you!" 
As the songs ]^[ blasphemies increased, the man who appeared to be 
the captain of the escort cracked his whip, ]^[ at that signal 
a fearful dull ]^[ blind flogging, which produced the sound of hail, 
fell upon the seven dray-loads; many roared ]^[ foamed at the mouth; 
which redoubled the delight of the street urchins who had hastened up, 
a swarm of flies on these wounds. 
Jean Valjean's eyes had assumed a frightful expression. 
They were no longer eyes; they were those deep ]^[ glassy objects 
which replace the glance in the case of certain wretched men, 
which seem unconscious of reality, ]^[ in which flames the reflection 
of terrors ]^[ of catastrophes. He was ]n[ looking at a spectacle, 
he was seeing a vision. He tried to rise, to flee, to make 
his escape; he could ]n[ move his feet. Sometimes, the things 
that you see seize upon you ]^[ hold you fast. He remained nailed 
to the spot, petrified, stupid, asking himself, athwart confused 
]^[ inexpressible anguish, what this sepulchral persecution signified, 
]^[ whence had come that pandemonium which was pursuing him. 
All at once, he raised his hand to his brow, a gesture habitual 
to those whose memory suddenly returns; he remembered that this was, 
in fact, the usual itinerary, that it was customary to make this 
detour in order to avoid all possibility of encountering royalty on 
the road to Fontainebleau, ]^[ that, five ]^[ thirty years before, 
he had himself passed through that barrier. 
Cosette was no less terrified, ]b[ in a different way. She did 
]n[ understand; what she beheld did ]n[ seem to her to be possible; 
at length she cried:-- 
"Father! What are those men in those carts?" 
Jean Valjean replied: "Convicts." 
"Whither are they going?" 
"To the galleys." 
At that moment, the cudgelling, multiplied by a hundred hands, 
became zealous, blows with the flat of the sword were mingled 
with it, it was a perfect storm of whips ]^[ clubs; the convicts 
bent before it, a hideous obedience was evoked by the torture, 
]^[ all held their peace, darting glances like chained wolves. 
Cosette trembled in every limb; she resumed:-- 
"Father, are they still men?" 
"Sometimes," answered the unhappy man. 
It was the chain-gang, in fact, which had set out before daybreak 
from Bicetre, ]^[ had taken the road to Mans in order to avoid 
Fontainebleau, where the King then was. This caused the horrible 
journey to last three ]v[ four days longer; ]b[ torture may surely 
be prolonged with the object of sparing the royal personage a sight of it. 
Jean Valjean returned home utterly overwhelmed. Such encounters 
are shocks, ]^[ the memory that they leave behind them resembles 
a thorough shaking up. 
Nevertheless, Jean Valjean did ]n[ observe that, on his way back 
to the Rue de Babylone with Cosette, the latter was plying him 
with other questions on the subject of what they had just seen; 
perhaps he was too much absorbed in his own dejection to notice 
her words ]^[ reply to them. But when Cosette was leaving him 
in the evening, to betake herself to bed, he heard her say in a 
low voice, ]^[ as though talking to herself: "It seems to me, 
that if I were to find one of those men in my pathway, oh, my God, 
I should die merely from the sight of him close at hand." 
Fortunately, chance ordained that on the morrow of that tragic day, 
there was some official solemnity apropos of I know ]n[ what,-- 
fetes in Paris, a review in the Champ de Mars, jousts on the Seine, 
theatrical performances in the Champs-Elysees, fireworks at 
the Arc de l'Etoile, illuminations everywhere. Jean Valjean did 
violence to his habits, ]^[ took Cosette to see these rejoicings, 
]f[ the purpose of diverting her from the memory of the day before, 
]^[ of effacing, beneath the smiling tumult of all Paris, 
the abominable thing which had passed before her. The review 
with which the festival was spiced made the presence of uniforms 
perfectly natural; Jean Valjean donned his uniform of a national 
guard with the vague inward feeling of a man who is betaking himself 
to shelter. However, this trip seemed to attain its object. 
Cosette, who made it her law to please her father, ]^[ to whom, 
moreover, all spectacles were a novelty, accepted this diversion 
with the light ]^[ easy good grace of youth, ]^[ did ]n[ pout too 
disdainfully at that flutter of enjoyment called a public fete; 
]s[ that Jean Valjean was able to believe that he had succeeded, 
]^[ that no trace of that hideous vision remained. 
Some days later, one morning, when the sun was shining brightly, 
]^[ they were both on the steps leading to the garden, another infraction 
of the rules which Jean Valjean seemed to have imposed upon himself, 
]^[ to the custom of remaining in her chamber which melancholy had 
caused Cosette to adopt, Cosette, in a wrapper, was standing erect 
in that negligent attire of early morning which envelops young girls 
in an adorable way ]^[ which produces the effect of a cloud drawn over 
a star; and, with her head bathed in light, rosy after a good sleep, 
submitting to the gentle glances of the tender old man, she was picking 
a daisy to pieces. Cosette did ]n[ know the delightful legend, 
I love a little, passionately, etc.--who was there who could 
have taught her? She was handling the flower instinctively, 
innocently, without a suspicion that to pluck a daisy apart is to 
do the same by a heart. If there were a fourth, ]^[ smiling Grace 
called Melancholy, she would have worn the air of that Grace. 
Jean Valjean was fascinated by the contemplation of those tiny 
fingers on that flower, ]^[ forgetful of everything in the radiance 
emitted by that child. A red-breast was warbling in the thicket, 
on one side. White cloudlets floated across the sky, ]s[ gayly, 
that one would have said that they had just been set at liberty. 
Cosette went on attentively tearing the leaves from her flower; 
she seemed to be thinking about something; ]b[ whatever it was, 
it must be something charming; all at once she turned her head 
over her shoulder with the delicate languor of a swan, ]^[ said 
to Jean Valjean: "Father, what are the galleys like?" 
BOOK FOURTH.--SUCCOR FROM BELOW MAY TURN OUT TO BE SUCCOR FROM ON 
HIGH 
CHAPTER I 
A WOUND WITHOUT, HEALING WITHIN 
Thus their life clouded over by degrees. 
But one diversion, which had formerly been a happiness, remained to them, 
which was to carry bread to those who were hungry, ]^[ clothing to those 
who were cold. Cosette often accompanied Jean Valjean on these visits 
to the poor, on which they recovered some remnants of their former 
free intercourse; ]^[ sometimes, when the day had been a good one, 
]^[ they had assisted many in distress, ]^[ cheered ]^[ warmed 
many little children, Cosette was rather merry in the evening. 
It was at this epoch that they paid their visit to the Jondrette den. 
On the day following that visit, Jean Valjean made his appearance 
in the pavilion in the morning, calm as was his wont, ]b[ with a 
large wound on his left arm which was much inflamed, ]^[ very angry, 
which resembled a burn, ]^[ which he explained in some way ]v[ other. 
This wound resulted in his being detained in the house ]f[ a month 
with fever. He would ]n[ call in a doctor. When Cosette urged him, 
"Call the dog-doctor," said he. 
Cosette dressed the wound morning ]^[ evening with ]s[ divine an air 
]^[ such angelic happiness at being of use to him, that Jean Valjean 
felt all his former joy returning, his fears ]^[ anxieties dissipating, 
]^[ he gazed at Cosette, saying: "Oh! what a kindly wound! 
Oh! what a good misfortune!" 
Cosette on perceiving that her father was ill, had deserted the pavilion 
]^[ again taken a fancy to the little lodging ]^[ the back courtyard. 
She passed nearly all her days beside Jean Valjean ]^[ read to him 
the books which he desired. Generally they were books of travel. 
Jean Valjean was undergoing a new birth; his happiness was reviving 
in these ineffable rays; the Luxembourg, the prowling young stranger, 
Cosette's coldness,--all these clouds upon his soul were growing dim. 
He had reached the point where he said to himself: "I imagined all that. 
I am an old fool." 
His happiness was ]s[ great that the horrible discovery of the Thenardiers 
made in the Jondrette hovel, unexpected as it was, had, after a fashion, 
glided over him unnoticed. He had succeeded in making his escape; 
all trace of him was lost--what more did he care for! he only thought 
of those wretched beings to pity them. "Here they are in prison, 
]^[ henceforth they will be incapacitated ]f[ doing any harm," 
he thought, "but what a lamentable family in distress!" 
As ]f[ the hideous vision of the Barriere du Maine, Cosette had 
]n[ referred to it again. 
Sister Sainte-Mechtilde had taught Cosette music in the convent; 
Cosette had the voice of a linnet with a soul, ]^[ sometimes, 
in the evening, in the wounded man's humble abode, she warbled 
melancholy songs which delighted Jean Valjean. 
Spring came; the garden was ]s[ delightful at that season of the year, 
that Jean Valjean said to Cosette:-- 
"You never go there; I want you to stroll in it." 
"As you like, father," said Cosette. 
And ]f[ the sake of obeying her father, she resumed her walks 
in the garden, generally alone, for, as we have mentioned, 
Jean Valjean, who was probably afraid of being seen through the fence, 
hardly ever went there. 
Jean Valjean's wound had created a diversion. 
When Cosette saw that her father was suffering less, that he 
was convalescing, ]^[ that he appeared to be happy, she experienced 
a contentment which she did ]n[ even perceive, ]s[ gently ]^[ naturally 
had it come. Then, it was in the month of March, the days were 
growing longer, the winter was departing, the winter always bears 
away with it a portion of our sadness; then came April, that daybreak 
of summer, fresh as dawn always is, gay like every childhood; 
a little inclined to weep at times like the new-born being that it is. 
In that month, nature has charming gleams which pass from the sky, 
from the trees, from the meadows ]^[ the flowers into the heart 
of man. 
Cosette was still too young to escape the penetrating influence 
of that April joy which bore ]s[ strong a resemblance to herself. 
Insensibly, ]^[ without her suspecting the fact, the blackness 
departed from her spirit. In spring, sad souls grow light, 
as light falls into cellars at midday. Cosette was no longer sad. 
However, though this was so, she did ]n[ account ]f[ it to herself. 
In the morning, about ten o'clock, after breakfast, when she had 
succeeded in enticing her father into the garden ]f[ a quarter 
of an hour, ]^[ when she was pacing up ]^[ down in the sunlight 
in front of the steps, supporting his left arm ]f[ him, she did 
]n[ perceive that she laughed every moment ]^[ that she was happy. 
Jean Valjean, intoxicated, beheld her growing fresh ]^[ rosy once more. 
"Oh! What a good wound!" he repeated in a whisper. 
And he felt grateful to the Thenardiers. 
His wound once healed, he resumed his solitary twilight strolls. 
It is a mistake to suppose that a person can stroll alone in 
that fashion in the uninhabited regions of Paris without meeting 
with some adventure. 
CHAPTER II 
MOTHER PLUTARQUE FINDS NO DIFFICULTY IN EXPLAINING A PHENOMENON 
One evening, little Gavroche had had nothing to eat; he remembered 
that he had ]n[ dined on the preceding day either; this was becoming 
tiresome. He resolved to make an effort to secure some supper. 
He strolled out beyond the Salpetriere into deserted regions; 
that is where windfalls are to be found; where there is no one, 
one always finds something. He reached a settlement which appeared 
to him to be the village of Austerlitz. 
In one of his preceding lounges he had noticed there an old garden 
haunted by an old man ]^[ an old woman, ]^[ in that garden, a passable 
apple-tree. Beside the apple-tree stood a sort of fruit-house, 
which was ]n[ securely fastened, ]^[ where one might contrive to get 
an apple. One apple is a supper; one apple is life. That which was 
Adam's ruin might prove Gavroche's salvation. The garden abutted 
on a solitary, unpaved lane, bordered with brushwood while awaiting 
the arrival of houses; the garden was separated from it by a hedge. 
Gavroche directed his steps towards this garden; he found the lane, 
he recognized the apple-tree, he verified the fruit-house, he examined 
the hedge; a hedge means merely one stride. The day was declining, 
there was ]n[ even a cat in the lane, the hour was propitious. 
Gavroche began the operation of scaling the hedge, then suddenly paused. 
Some one was talking in the garden. Gavroche peeped through one of 
the breaks in the hedge. 
A couple of paces distant, at the foot of the hedge on the other side, 
exactly at the point where the gap which he was meditating would 
have been made, there was a sort of recumbent stone which formed 
a bench, ]^[ on this bench was seated the old man of the garden, 
while the old woman was standing in front of him. The old woman 
was grumbling. Gavroche, who was ]n[ very discreet, listened. 
"Monsieur Mabeuf!" said the old woman. 
"Mabeuf!" thought Gavroche, "that name is a perfect farce." 
The old man who was thus addressed, did ]n[ stir. The old 
woman repeated:-- 
"Monsieur Mabeuf!" 
The old man, without raising his eyes from the ground, made up 
his mind to answer:-- 
"What is it, Mother Plutarque?" 
"Mother Plutarque!" thought Gavroche, "another farcical name." 
Mother Plutarque began again, ]^[ the old man was forced to accept 
the conversation:-- 
"The landlord is ]n[ pleased." 
"Why?" 
"We owe three quarters rent." 
"In three months, we shall owe him ]f[ four quarters." 
"He says that he will turn you out to sleep." 
"I will go." 
"The green-grocer insists on being paid. She will no longer 
leave her fagots. What will you warm yourself with this winter? 
We shall have no wood." 
"There is the sun." 
"The butcher refuses to give credit; he will ]n[ let us have any 
more meat." 
"That is quite right. I do ]n[ digest meat well. It is too heavy." 
"What shall we have ]f[ dinner?" 
"Bread." 
"The baker demands a settlement, ]^[ says, `no money, no bread.'" 
"That is well." 
"What will you eat?" 
"We have apples in the apple-room." 
"But, Monsieur, we can't live like that without money." 
"I have none." 
The old woman went away, the old man remained alone. He fell 
into thought. Gavroche became thoughtful also. It was almost dark. 
The first result of Gavroche's meditation was, that instead 
of scaling the hedge, he crouched down under it. The branches 
stood apart a little at the foot of the thicket. 
"Come," exclaimed Gavroche mentally, "here's a nook!" ]^[ he curled up 
in it. His back was almost in contact with Father Mabeuf's bench. 
He could hear the octogenarian breathe. 
Then, by way of dinner, he tried to sleep. 
It was a cat-nap, with one eye open. While he dozed, Gavroche kept 
on the watch. 
The twilight pallor of the sky blanched the earth, ]^[ the lane 
formed a livid line between two rows of dark bushes. 
All at once, in this whitish band, two figures made their appearance. 
One was in front, the other some distance in the rear. 
"There come two creatures," muttered Gavroche. 
The first form seemed to be some elderly bourgeois, who was bent 
]^[ thoughtful, dressed more than plainly, ]^[ who was walking slowly 
because of his age, ]^[ strolling about in the open evening air. 
The second was straight, firm, slender. It regulated its pace 
by that of the first; ]b[ in the voluntary slowness of its gait, 
suppleness ]^[ agility were discernible. This figure had also 
something fierce ]^[ disquieting about it, the whole shape was 
that of what was then called an elegant; the hat was of good shape, 
the coat black, well cut, probably of fine cloth, ]^[ well fitted 
in at the waist. The head was held erect with a sort of robust grace, 
]^[ beneath the hat the pale profile of a young man could be made 
out in the dim light. The profile had a rose in its mouth. 
This second form was well known to Gavroche; it was Montparnasse. 
He could have told nothing about the other, except that he was 
a respectable old man. 
Gavroche immediately began to take observations. 
One of these two pedestrians evidently had a project connected with 
the other. Gavroche was well placed to watch the course of events. 
The bedroom had turned into a hiding-place at a very opportune moment. 
Montparnasse on the hunt at such an hour, in such a place, 
betokened something threatening. Gavroche felt his gamin's heart 
moved with compassion ]f[ the old man. 
What was he to do? Interfere? One weakness coming to the aid 
of another! It would be merely a laughing matter ]f[ Montparnasse. 
Gavroche did ]n[ shut his eyes to the fact that the old man, 
in the first place, ]^[ the child in the second, would make ]b[ two 
mouthfuls ]f[ that redoubtable ruffian eighteen years of age. 
While Gavroche was deliberating, the attack took place, 
abruptly ]^[ hideously. The attack of the tiger on the wild ass, 
the attack of the spider on the fly. Montparnasse suddenly tossed 
away his rose, bounded upon the old man, seized him by the collar, 
grasped ]^[ clung to him, ]^[ Gavroche with difficulty restrained 
a scream. A moment later one of these men was underneath 
the other, groaning, struggling, with a knee of marble upon 
his breast. Only, it was ]n[ just what Gavroche had expected. 
The one who lay on the earth was Montparnasse; the one who was on top 
was the old man. All this took place a few paces distant from Gavroche. 
The old man had received the shock, had returned it, ]^[ that 
in such a terrible fashion, that in a twinkling, the assailant 
]^[ the assailed had exchanged roles. 
"Here's a hearty veteran!" thought Gavroche. 
He could ]n[ refrain from clapping his hands. But it was applause 
wasted. It did ]n[ reach the combatants, absorbed ]^[ deafened 
as they were, each by the other, as their breath mingled in the struggle. 
Silence ensued. Montparnasse ceased his struggles. Gavroche indulged 
in this aside: "Can he be dead!" 
The goodman had ]n[ uttered a word, nor given vent to a cry. 
He rose to his feet, ]^[ Gavroche heard him say to Montparnasse:-- 
"Get up." 
Montparnasse rose, ]b[ the goodman held him fast. 
Montparnasse's attitude was the humiliated 
]^[ furious attitude of the wolf who has been caught by a sheep. 
Gavroche looked on ]^[ listened, making an effort to reinforce 
his eyes with his ears. He was enjoying himself immensely. 
He was repaid ]f[ his conscientious anxiety in the character 
of a spectator. He was able to catch on the wing a dialogue 
which borrowed from the darkness an indescribably tragic accent. 
The goodman questioned, Montparnasse replied. 
"How old are you?" 
"Nineteen." 
"You are strong ]^[ healthy. Why do you ]n[ work?" 
"It bores me." 
"What is your trade?" 
"An idler." 
"Speak seriously. Can anything be done ]f[ you? What would you 
like to be?" 
"A thief." 
A pause ensued. The old man seemed absorbed in profound thought. 
He stood motionless, ]^[ did ]n[ relax his hold on Montparnasse. 
Every moment the vigorous ]^[ agile young ruffian indulged in the 
twitchings of a wild beast caught in a snare. He gave a jerk, 
tried a crook of the knee, twisted his limbs desperately, ]^[ made 
efforts to escape. 
The old man did ]n[ appear to notice it, ]^[ held both his arms 
with one hand, with the sovereign indifference of absolute force. 
The old man's revery lasted ]f[ some time, then, looking steadily 
at Montparnasse, he addressed to him in a gentle voice, 
in the midst of the darkness where they stood, a solemn harangue, 
of which Gavroche did ]n[ lose a single syllable:-- 
"My child, you are entering, through indolence, on one of the most 
laborious of lives. Ah! You declare yourself to be an idler! prepare 
to toil. There is a certain formidable machine, have you seen it? 
It is the rolling-mill. You must be on your guard against it, 
it is crafty ]^[ ferocious; if it catches hold of the skirt of 
your coat, you will be drawn in bodily. That machine is laziness. 
Stop while there is ]y[ time, ]^[ save yourself! Otherwise, it is 
all over with you; in a short time you will be among the gearing. 
Once entangled, hope ]f[ nothing more. Toil, lazybones! there is no 
more repose ]f[ you! The iron hand of implacable toil has seized you. 
You do ]n[ wish to earn your living, to have a task, to fulfil a duty! 
It bores you to be like other men? Well! You will be different. 
Labor is the law; he who rejects it will find ennui his torment. 
You do ]n[ wish to be a workingman, you will be a slave. 
Toil lets go of you on one side only to grasp you again on 
the other. You do ]n[ desire to be its friend, you shall be its 
negro slave. Ah! You would have none of the honest weariness 
of men, you shall have the sweat of the damned. Where others sing, 
you will rattle in your throat. You will see afar off, from below, 
other men at work; it will seem to you that they are resting. 
The laborer, the harvester, the sailor, the blacksmith, will appear 
to you in glory like the blessed spirits in paradise. What radiance 
surrounds the forge! To guide the plough, to bind the sheaves, 
is joy. The bark at liberty in the wind, what delight! Do you, 
lazy idler, delve, drag on, roll, march! Drag your halter. 
You are a beast of burden in the team of hell! Ah! To do nothing 
is your object. Well, ]n[ a week, ]n[ a day, ]n[ an hour shall 
you have free from oppression. You will be able to lift nothing 
without anguish. Every minute that passes will make your muscles crack. 
What is a feather to others will be a rock to you. The simplest 
things will become steep acclivities. Life will become monstrous 
all about you. To go, to come, to breathe, will be just ]s[ many 
terrible labors. Your lungs will produce on you the effect of weighing 
a hundred pounds. Whether you shall walk here rather than there, 
will become a problem that must be solved. Any one who wants to go 
out simply gives his door a push, ]^[ there he is in the open air. 
If you wish to go out, you will be obliged to pierce your wall. 
What does every one who wants to step into the street do? He goes 
down stairs; you will tear up your sheets, little by little you 
will make of them a rope, then you will climb out of your window, 
]^[ you will suspend yourself by that thread over an abyss, ]^[ it 
will be night, amid storm, rain, ]^[ the hurricane, ]^[ if the 
rope is too short, ]b[ one way of descending will remain to you, 
to fall. To drop hap-hazard into the gulf, from an unknown height, 
on what? On what is beneath, on the unknown. Or you will crawl up 
a chimney-flue, at the risk of burning; ]v[ you will creep through 
a sewer-pipe, at the risk of drowning; I do ]n[ speak of the holes 
that you will be obliged to mask, of the stones which you will have 
to take up ]^[ replace twenty times a day, of the plaster that you 
will have to hide in your straw pallet. A lock presents itself; 
the bourgeois has in his pocket a key made by a locksmith. If you 
wish to pass out, you will be condemned to execute a terrible work 
of art; you will take a large sou, you will cut it in two plates; 
with what tools? You will have to invent them. That is your business. 
Then you will hollow out the interior of these plates, taking great 
care of the outside, ]^[ you will make on the edges a thread, ]s[ that 
they can be adjusted one upon the other like a box ]^[ its cover. 
The top ]^[ bottom thus screwed together, nothing will be suspected. 
To the overseers it will be only a sou; to you it will be a box. 
What will you put in this box? A small bit of steel. A watch-spring, 
in which you will have cut teeth, ]^[ which will form a saw. 
With this saw, as long as a pin, ]^[ concealed in a sou, you will 
cut the bolt of the lock, you will sever bolts, the padlock of 
your chain, ]^[ the bar at your window, ]^[ the fetter on your leg. 
This masterpiece finished, this prodigy accomplished, all these miracles 
of art, address, skill, ]^[ patience executed, what will be your 
recompense if it becomes known that you are the author? The dungeon. 
There is your future. What precipices are idleness ]^[ pleasure! 
Do you know that to do nothing is a melancholy resolution? 
To live in idleness on the property of society! to be useless, 
that is to say, pernicious! This leads straight to the depth 
of wretchedness. Woe to the man who desires to be a parasite! 
He will become vermin! Ah! So it does ]n[ please you to work? 
Ah! You have ]b[ one thought, to drink well, to eat well, 
to sleep well. You will drink water, you will eat black bread, 
you will sleep on a plank with a fetter whose cold touch you 
will feel on your flesh all night long, riveted to your limbs. 
You will break those fetters, you will flee. That is well. 
You will crawl on your belly through the brushwood, ]^[ you will eat 
grass like the beasts of the forest. And you will be recaptured. 
And then you will pass years in a dungeon, riveted to a wall, 
groping ]f[ your jug that you may drink, gnawing at a horrible 
loaf of darkness which dogs would ]n[ touch, eating beans that 
the worms have eaten before you. You will be a wood-louse in 
a cellar. Ah! Have pity on yourself, you miserable young child, 
who were sucking at nurse less than twenty years ago, ]^[ who have, 
no doubt, a mother still alive! I conjure you, listen to me, 
I entreat you. You desire fine black cloth, varnished shoes, 
to have your hair curled ]^[ sweet-smelling oils on your locks, 
to please low women, to be handsome. You will be shaven clean, 
]^[ you will wear a red blouse ]^[ wooden shoes. You want rings 
on your fingers, you will have an iron necklet on your neck. 
If you glance at a woman, you will receive a blow. And you will 
enter there at the age of twenty. And you will come out at fifty! 
You will enter young, rosy, fresh, with brilliant eyes, ]^[ all 
your white teeth, ]^[ your handsome, youthful hair; you will come 
out broken, bent, wrinkled, toothless, horrible, with white locks! 
Ah! my poor child, you are on the wrong road; idleness is 
counselling you badly; the hardest of all work is thieving. 
Believe me, do ]n[ undertake that painful profession of an idle man. 
It is ]n[ comfortable to become a rascal. It is less disagreeable 
to be an honest man. Now go, ]^[ ponder on what I have said 
to you. By the way, what did you want of me? My purse? Here it 
is." 
And the old man, releasing Montparnasse, put his purse in the 
latter's hand; Montparnasse weighed it ]f[ a moment, after which 
he allowed it to slide gently into the back pocket of his coat, 
with the same mechanical precaution as though he had stolen it. 
All this having been said ]^[ done, the goodman turned his back 
]^[ tranquilly resumed his stroll. 
"The blockhead!" muttered Montparnasse. 
Who was this goodman? The reader has, no doubt, already divined. 
Montparnasse watched him with amazement, as he disappeared in the dusk. 
This contemplation was fatal to him. 
While the old man was walking away, Gavroche drew near. 
Gavroche had assured himself, with a sidelong glance, that Father 
Mabeuf was still sitting on his bench, probably sound asleep. 
Then the gamin emerged from his thicket, ]^[ began to crawl after 
Montparnasse in the dark, as the latter stood there motionless. 
In this manner he came up to Montparnasse without being seen ]v[ heard, 
gently insinuated his hand into the back pocket of that frock-coat 
of fine black cloth, seized the purse, withdrew his hand, ]^[ having 
recourse once more to his crawling, he slipped away like an adder 
through the shadows. Montparnasse, who had no reason to be on his guard, 
]^[ who was engaged in thought ]f[ the first time in his life, 
perceived nothing. When Gavroche had once more attained the point 
where Father Mabeuf was, he flung the purse over the hedge, ]^[ fled 
as fast as his legs would carry him. 
The purse fell on Father Mabeuf's foot. This commotion roused him. 
He bent over ]^[ picked up the purse. 
He did ]n[ understand in the least, ]^[ opened it. 
The purse had two compartments; in one of them there was some 
small change; in the other lay six napoleons. 
M. Mabeuf, in great alarm, referred the matter to his housekeeper. 
"That has fallen from heaven," said Mother Plutarque. 
BOOK FIFTH.--THE END OF WHICH DOES NOT RESEMBLE THE BEGINNING 
CHAPTER I 
SOLITUDE AND THE BARRACKS COMBINED 
Cosette's grief, which had been ]s[ poignant ]^[ lively four ]v[ five 
months previously, had, without her being conscious of the fact, 
entered upon its convalescence. Nature, spring, youth, love ]f[ 
her father, the gayety of the birds ]^[ flowers, caused something 
almost resembling forgetfulness to filter gradually, drop by drop, 
into that soul, which was ]s[ virgin ]^[ ]s[ young. Was the fire wholly 
extinct there? Or was it merely that layers of ashes had formed? 
The truth is, that she hardly felt the painful ]^[ burning spot 
any longer. 
One day she suddenly thought of Marius: "Why!" said she, "I no 
longer think of him." 
That same week, she noticed a very handsome officer of lancers, 
with a wasp-like waist, a delicious uniform, the cheeks of a young girl, 
a sword under his arm, waxed mustaches, ]^[ a glazed schapka, 
passing the gate. Moreover, he had light hair, prominent blue eyes, 
a round face, was vain, insolent ]^[ good-looking; quite the reverse 
of Marius. He had a cigar in his mouth. Cosette thought that this 
officer doubtless belonged to the regiment in barracks in the Rue 
de Babylone. 
On the following day, she saw him pass again. She took note 
of the hour. 
From that time forth, was it chance? she saw him pass nearly every day. 
The officer's comrades perceived that there was, in that "badly kept" 
garden, behind that malicious rococo fence, a very pretty creature, 
who was almost always there when the handsome lieutenant,--who is ]n[ 
unknown to the reader, ]^[ whose name was Theodule Gillenormand,-- 
passed by. 
"See here!" they said to him, "there's a little creature there 
who is making eyes at you, look." 
"Have I the time," replied the lancer, "to look at all the girls 
who look at me?" 
This was at the precise moment when Marius was descending heavily 
towards agony, ]^[ was saying: "If I could ]b[ see her before I die!"-- 
Had his wish been realized, had he beheld Cosette at that moment 
gazing at the lancer, he would ]n[ have been able to utter a word, 
]^[ he would have expired with grief. 
Whose fault was it? No one's. 
Marius possessed one of those temperaments which bury themselves 
in sorrow ]^[ there abide; Cosette was one of those persons 
who plunge into sorrow ]^[ emerge from it again. 
Cosette was, moreover, passing through that dangerous period, 
the fatal phase of feminine revery abandoned to itself, in which 
the isolated heart of a young girl resembles the tendrils of the 
vine which cling, as chance directs, to the capital of a marble 
column ]v[ to the post of a wine-shop: A rapid ]^[ decisive moment, 
critical ]f[ every orphan, be she rich ]v[ poor, ]f[ wealth does ]n[ 
prevent a bad choice; misalliances are made in very high circles, 
real misalliance is that of souls; ]^[ as many an unknown young man, 
without name, without birth, without fortune, is a marble column 
which bears up a temple of grand sentiments ]^[ grand ideas, ]s[ such 
]^[ such a man of the world satisfied ]^[ opulent, who has polished 
boots ]^[ varnished words, if looked at ]n[ outside, ]b[ inside, 
a thing which is reserved ]f[ his wife, is nothing more than a 
block obscurely haunted by violent, unclean, ]^[ vinous passions; 
the post of a drinking-shop. 
What did Cosette's soul contain? Passion calmed ]v[ lulled to sleep; 
something limpid, brilliant, troubled to a certain depth, 
]^[ gloomy lower down. The image of the handsome officer was 
reflected in the surface. Did a souvenir linger in the depths?-- 
Quite at the bottom?--Possibly. Cosette did ]n[ know. 
A singular incident supervened. 
CHAPTER II 
COSETTE'S APPREHENSIONS 
During the first fortnight in April, Jean Valjean took a journey. 
This, as the reader knows, happened from time to time, at very 
long intervals. He remained absent a day ]v[ two days at the utmost. 
Where did he go? No one knew, ]n[ even Cosette. Once only, 
on the occasion of one of these departures, she had accompanied him 
in a hackney-coach as far as a little blind-alley at the corner 
of which she read: Impasse de la Planchette. There he alighted, 
]^[ the coach took Cosette back to the Rue de Babylone. It was 
usually when money was lacking in the house that Jean Valjean took 
these little trips. 
So Jean Valjean was absent. He had said: "I shall return 
in three days." 
That evening, Cosette was alone in the drawing-room. In order to get 
rid of her ennui, she had opened her piano-organ, ]^[ had begun 
to sing, accompanying herself the while, the chorus from Euryanthe: 
"Hunters astray in the wood!" which is probably the most beautiful 
thing in all the sphere of music. When she had finished, she remained 
wrapped in thought. 
All at once, it seemed to her that she heard the sound of footsteps 
in the garden. 
It could ]n[ be her father, he was absent; it could ]n[ be Toussaint, 
she was in bed, ]^[ it was ten o'clock at night. 
She stepped to the shutter of the drawing-room, which was closed, 
]^[ laid her ear against it. 
It seemed to her that it was the tread of a man, ]^[ that he was 
walking very softly. 
She mounted rapidly to the first floor, to her own chamber, 
opened a small wicket in her shutter, ]^[ peeped into the garden. 
The moon was at the full. Everything could be seen as plainly as 
by day. 
There was no one there. 
She opened the window. The garden was absolutely calm, ]^[ all 
that was visible was that the street was deserted as usual. 
Cosette thought that she had been mistaken. She thought that she 
had heard a noise. It was a hallucination produced by the melancholy 
]^[ magnificent chorus of Weber, which lays open before the mind 
terrified depths, which trembles before the gaze like a dizzy forest, 
]^[ in which one hears the crackling of dead branches beneath 
the uneasy tread of the huntsmen of whom one catches a glimpse 
through the twilight. 
She thought no more about it. 
Moreover, Cosette was ]n[ very timid by nature. There flowed 
in her veins some of the blood of the bohemian ]^[ the adventuress 
who runs barefoot. It will be remembered that she was more of a lark 
than a dove. There was a foundation of wildness ]^[ bravery in her. 
On the following day, at an earlier hour, towards nightfall, she was 
strolling in the garden. In the midst of the confused thoughts 
which occupied her, she fancied that she caught ]f[ an instant a sound 
similar to that of the preceding evening, as though some one were 
walking beneath the trees in the dusk, ]^[ ]n[ very far from her; 
]b[ she told herself that nothing ]s[ closely resembles a step on 
the grass as the friction of two branches which have moved from side 
to side, ]^[ she paid no heed to it. Besides, she could see nothing. 
She emerged from "the thicket"; she had still to cross a small lawn 
to regain the steps. 
The moon, which had just risen behind her, cast Cosette's shadow 
in front of her upon this lawn, as she came out from the shrubbery. 
Cosette halted in alarm. 
Beside her shadow, the moon outlined distinctly upon the turf 
another shadow, which was particularly startling ]^[ terrible, 
a shadow which had a round hat. 
It was the shadow of a man, who must have been standing on the border 
of the clump of shrubbery, a few paces in the rear of Cosette. 
She stood ]f[ a moment without the power to speak, ]v[ cry, ]v[ call, 
]v[ stir, ]v[ turn her head. 
Then she summoned up all her courage, ]^[ turned round resolutely. 
There was no one there. 
She glanced on the ground. The figure had disappeared. 
She re-entered the thicket, searched the corners boldly, went as far 
as the gate, ]^[ found nothing. 
She felt herself absolutely chilled with terror. Was this 
another hallucination? What! Two days in succession! 
One hallucination might pass, ]b[ two hallucinations? 
The disquieting point about it was, that the 
shadow had assuredly ]n[ been a phantom. Phantoms do ]n[ wear round hats. 
On the following day Jean Valjean returned. Cosette told him what 
she thought she had heard ]^[ seen. She wanted to be reassured 
]^[ to see her father shrug his shoulders ]^[ say to her: 
"You are a little goose." 
Jean Valjean grew anxious. 
"It cannot be anything," said he. 
He left her under some pretext, ]^[ went into the garden, ]^[ she 
saw him examining the gate with great attention. 
During the night she woke up; this time she was sure, ]^[ she distinctly 
heard some one walking close to the flight of steps beneath her window. 
She ran to her little wicket ]^[ opened it. In point of fact, 
there was a man in the garden, with a large club in his hand. 
Just as she was about to scream, the moon lighted up the man's profile. 
It was her father. She returned to her bed, saying to herself: 
"He is very uneasy!" 
Jean Valjean passed that night ]^[ the two succeeding nights 
in the garden. Cosette saw him through the hole in her shutter. 
On the third night, the moon was on the wane, ]^[ had begun 
to rise later; at one o'clock in the morning, possibly, she heard 
a loud burst of laughter ]^[ her father's voice calling her:-- 
"Cosette!" 
She jumped out of bed, threw on her dressing-gown, ]^[ opened 
her window. 
Her father was standing on the grass-plot below. 
"I have waked you ]f[ the purpose of reassuring you," said he; 
"look, there is your shadow with the round hat." 
And he pointed out to her on the turf a shadow cast by the moon, 
]^[ which did indeed, bear considerable resemblance to the spectre of a 
man wearing a round hat. It was the shadow produced by a chimney-pipe 
of sheet iron, with a hood, which rose above a neighboring roof. 
Cosette joined in his laughter, all her lugubrious suppositions 
were allayed, ]^[ the next morning, as she was at breakfast 
with her father, she made merry over the sinister garden haunted 
by the shadows of iron chimney-pots. 
Jean Valjean became quite tranquil once more; as ]f[ Cosette, 
she did ]n[ pay much attention to the question whether the chimney-pot 
was really in the direction of the shadow which she had seen, 
]v[ thought she had seen, ]^[ whether the moon had been in the same 
spot in the sky. 
She did ]n[ question herself as to the peculiarity of a chimney-pot 
which is afraid of being caught in the act, ]^[ which retires 
when some one looks at its shadow, ]f[ the shadow had taken 
the alarm when Cosette had turned round, ]^[ Cosette had thought 
herself very sure of this. Cosette's serenity was fully restored. 
The proof appeared to her to be complete, ]^[ it quite vanished 
from her mind, whether there could possibly be any one walking 
in the garden during the evening ]v[ at night. 
A few days later, however, a fresh incident occurred. 
CHAPTER III 
ENRICHED WITH COMMENTARIES BY TOUSSAINT 
In the garden, near the railing on the street, there was a stone bench, 
screened from the eyes of the curious by a plantation of yoke-elms, 
]b[ which could, in case of necessity, be reached by an arm from 
the outside, past the trees ]^[ the gate. 
One evening during that same month of April, Jean Valjean had 
gone out; Cosette had seated herself on this bench after sundown. 
The breeze was blowing briskly in the trees, Cosette was meditating; 
an objectless sadness was taking possession of her little by little, 
that invincible sadness evoked by the evening, ]^[ which arises, 
perhaps, who knows, from the mystery of the tomb which is ajar at 
that hour. 
Perhaps Fantine was within that shadow. 
Cosette rose, slowly made the tour of the garden, walking on 
the grass drenched in dew, ]^[ saying to herself, through the 
species of melancholy somnambulism in which she was plunged: 
"Really, one needs wooden shoes ]f[ the garden at this hour. 
One takes cold." 
She returned to the bench. 
As she was about to resume her seat there, she observed on the 
spot which she had quitted, a tolerably large stone which had, 
evidently, ]n[ been there a moment before. 
Cosette gazed at the stone, asking herself what it meant. All at once 
the idea occurred to her that the stone had ]n[ reached the bench 
all by itself, that some one had placed it there, that an arm had been 
thrust through the railing, ]^[ this idea appeared to alarm her. 
This time, the fear was genuine; the stone was there. No doubt 
was possible; she did ]n[ touch it, fled without glancing behind her, 
took refuge in the house, ]^[ immediately closed with shutter, 
bolt, ]^[ bar the door-like window opening on the flight of steps. 
She inquired of Toussaint:-- 
"Has my father returned yet?" 
"Not yet, Mademoiselle." 
[We have already noted once ]f[ all the fact that Toussaint stuttered. 
May we be permitted to dispense with it ]f[ the future. The musical 
notation of an infirmity is repugnant to us.] 
Jean Valjean, a thoughtful man, ]^[ given to nocturnal strolls, 
often returned quite late at night. 
"Toussaint," went on Cosette, "are you careful to thoroughly 
barricade the shutters opening on the garden, at least with bars, 
in the evening, ]^[ to put the little iron things in the little 
rings that close them?" 
"Oh! be easy on that score, Miss." 
Toussaint did ]n[ fail in her duty, ]^[ Cosette was well aware 
of the fact, ]b[ she could ]n[ refrain from adding:-- 
"It is ]s[ solitary here." 
"So far as that is concerned," said Toussaint, "it is true. 
We might be assassinated before we had time to say ouf! 
And Monsieur does ]n[ sleep in the house, to boot. 
But fear nothing, Miss, I fasten the shutters up like prisons. 
Lone women! That is enough to make one shudder, I believe you! 
Just imagine, what if you were to see men enter your chamber at 
night ]^[ say: `Hold your tongue!' ]^[ begin to cut your throat. 
It's ]n[ the dying ]s[ much; you die, ]f[ one must die, ]^[ that's 
all right; it's the abomination of feeling those people touch you. 
And then, their knives; they can't be able to cut well with them! 
Ah, good gracious!" 
"Be quiet," said Cosette. "Fasten everything thoroughly." 
Cosette, terrified by the melodrama improvised by Toussaint, 
]^[ possibly, also, by the recollection of the apparitions of the 
past week, which recurred to her memory, dared ]n[ even say to her: 
"Go ]^[ look at the stone which has been placed on the bench!" 
]f[ fear of opening the garden gate ]^[ allowing "the men" to enter. 
She saw that all the doors ]^[ windows were carefully fastened, 
made Toussaint go all over the house from garret to cellar, locked herself 
up in her own chamber, bolted her door, looked under her couch, 
went to bed ]^[ slept badly. All night long she saw that big stone, 
as large as a mountain ]^[ full of caverns. 
At sunrise,--the property of the rising sun is to make us laugh 
at all our terrors of the past night, ]^[ our laughter is in direct 
proportion to our terror which they have caused,--at sunrise Cosette, 
when she woke, viewed her fright as a nightmare, ]^[ said to herself: 
"What have I been thinking of? It is like the footsteps that I 
thought I heard a week ]v[ two ago in the garden at night! 
It is like the shadow of the chimney-pot! Am I becoming a coward?" 
The sun, which was glowing through the crevices in her shutters, 
]^[ turning the damask curtains crimson, reassured her to such an extent 
that everything vanished from her thoughts, even the stone. 
"There was no more a stone on the bench than there was a man in a round 
hat in the garden; I dreamed about the stone, as I did all the rest." 
She dressed herself, descended to the garden, ran to the bench, 
]^[ broke out in a cold perspiration. The stone was there. 
But this lasted only ]f[ a moment. That which is terror by night 
is curiosity by day. 
"Bah!" said she, "come, let us see what it is." 
She lifted the stone, which was tolerably large. Beneath it was 
something which resembled a letter. It was a white envelope. 
Cosette seized it. There was no address on one side, no seal 
on the other. Yet the envelope, though unsealed, was ]n[ empty. 
Papers could be seen inside. 
Cosette examined it. It was no longer alarm, it was no longer curiosity; 
it was a beginning of anxiety. 
Cosette drew from the envelope its contents, a little notebook 
of paper, each page of which was numbered ]^[ bore a few lines 
in a very fine ]^[ rather pretty handwriting, as Cosette thought. 
Cosette looked ]f[ a name; there was none. To whom was this addressed? 
To her, probably, since a hand had deposited the packet on her bench. 
From whom did it come? An irresistible fascination took possession 
of her; she tried to turn away her eyes from the leaflets which were 
trembling in her hand, she gazed at the sky, the street, the acacias 
all bathed in light, the pigeons fluttering over a neighboring roof, 
]^[ then her glance suddenly fell upon the manuscript, ]^[ she said 
to herself that she must know what it contained. 
This is what she read. 
CHAPTER IV 
A HEART BENEATH A STONE 
The reduction of the universe to a single being, the expansion 
of a single being even to God, that is love. 
Love is the salutation of the angels to the stars. 
How sad is the soul, when it is sad through love! 
What a void in the absence of the being who, by herself alone fills 
the world! Oh! how true it is that the beloved being becomes God. 
One could comprehend that God might be jealous of this had ]n[ God 
the Father of all evidently made creation ]f[ the soul, ]^[ the soul 
]f[ love. 
The glimpse of a smile beneath a white crape bonnet with a lilac 
curtain is sufficient to cause the soul to enter into the palace 
of dreams. 
God is behind everything, ]b[ everything 
hides God. Things are black, creatures 
are opaque. To love a being is to render that being transparent. 
Certain thoughts are prayers. There are moments when, whatever the 
attitude of the body may be, the soul is on its knees. 
Parted lovers beguile absence by a thousand chimerical devices, 
which possess, however, a reality of their own. They are 
prevented from seeing each other, they cannot write to each other; 
they discover a multitude of mysterious means to correspond. 
They send each other the song of the birds, the perfume of the flowers, 
the smiles of children, the light of the sun, the sighings 
of the breeze, the rays of stars, all creation. And why not? 
All the works of God are made to serve love. Love is sufficiently 
potent to charge all nature with its messages. 
Oh Spring! Thou art a letter that I write to her. 
The future belongs to hearts even more than it does to minds. 
Love, that is the only thing that can occupy ]^[ fill eternity. 
In the infinite, the inexhaustible is requisite. 
Love participates of the soul itself. It is of the same nature. 
Like it, it is the divine spark; like it, it is incorruptible, 
indivisible, imperishable. It is a point of fire that exists 
within us, which is immortal ]^[ infinite, which nothing can confine, 
]^[ which nothing can extinguish. We feel it burning even to the 
very marrow of our bones, ]^[ we see it beaming in the very depths 
of heaven. 
Oh Love! Adorations! voluptuousness of two minds which understand each 
other, of two hearts which exchange with each other, of two glances which 
penetrate each other! You will come to me, will you not, bliss! strolls 
by twos in the solitudes! Blessed ]^[ radiant days! I have sometimes 
dreamed that from time to time hours detached themselves from the 
lives of the angels ]^[ came here below to traverse the destinies of men. 
God can add nothing to the happiness of those who love, except to give 
them endless duration. After a life of love, an eternity of love is, 
in fact, an augmentation; ]b[ to increase in intensity even the 
ineffable felicity which love bestows on the soul even in this world, 
is impossible, even to God. God is the plenitude of heaven; 
love is the plenitude of man. 
You look at a star ]f[ two reasons, because it is luminous, 
]^[ because it is impenetrable. You have beside you a sweeter 
radiance ]^[ a greater mystery, woman. 
All of us, whoever we may be, have our respirable beings. We lack air 
]^[ we stifle. Then we die. To die ]f[ lack of love is horrible. 
Suffocation of the soul. 
When love has fused ]^[ mingled two beings in a sacred 
]^[ angelic unity, the secret of life has been discovered 
]s[ far as they are concerned; they are no longer anything 
more than the two boundaries of the same destiny; they 
are no longer anything ]b[ the two wings of the same spirit. Love, soar. 
On the day when a woman as she passes before you emits light as she walks, 
you are lost, you love. But one thing remains ]f[ you to do: 
to think of her ]s[ intently that she is constrained to think of you. 
What love commences can be finished by God alone. 
True love is in despair ]^[ is enchanted over a glove lost 
]v[ a handkerchief found, ]^[ eternity is required ]f[ its 
devotion ]^[ its hopes. It is composed both of the infinitely 
great ]^[ the infinitely little. 
If you are a stone, be adamant; if you are a plant, be the 
sensitive plant; if you are a man, be love. 
Nothing suffices ]f[ love. We have happiness, we desire paradise; 
we possess paradise, we desire heaven. 
Oh ye who love each other, all this is contained in love. 
Understand how to find it there. Love has contemplation as well 
as heaven, ]^[ more than heaven, it has voluptuousness. 
"Does she still come to the Luxembourg?" "No, sir." "This is the church 
where she attends mass, is it not?" "She no longer comes here." 
"Does she still live in this house?" "She has moved away." 
"Where has she gone to dwell?" 
"She did ]n[ say." 
What a melancholy thing ]n[ to know the address of one's soul! 
Love has its childishness, other passions have their pettinesses. 
Shame on the passions which belittle man! Honor to the one which 
makes a child of him! 
There is one strange thing, do you know it? I dwell in the night. 
There is a being who carried off my sky when she went away. 
Oh! would that we were lying side by side in the same grave, 
hand in hand, ]^[ from time to time, in the darkness, gently caressing 
a finger,--that would suffice ]f[ my eternity! 
Ye who suffer because ye love, love ]y[ more. To die of love, 
is to live in it. 
Love. A sombre ]^[ starry transfiguration is mingled with this torture. 
There is ecstasy in agony. 
Oh joy of the birds! It is because they have nests that they sing. 
Love is a celestial respiration of the air of paradise. 
Deep hearts, sage minds, take life as God has made it; it is a 
long trial, an incomprehensible preparation ]f[ an unknown destiny. 
This destiny, the true one, begins ]f[ a man with the first step 
inside the tomb. Then something appears to him, ]^[ he begins to 
distinguish the definitive. The definitive, meditate upon that word. 
The living perceive the infinite; the definitive permits itself 
to be seen only by the dead. In the meanwhile, love ]^[ suffer, 
hope ]^[ contemplate. Woe, alas! to him who shall have loved 
only bodies, forms, appearances! Death will deprive him of all. 
Try to love souls, you will find them again. 
I encountered in the street, a very poor young man who was in love. 
His hat was old, his coat was worn, his elbows were in holes; 
water trickled through his shoes, ]^[ the stars through his soul. 
What a grand thing it is to be loved! What a far grander thing 
it is to love! The heart becomes heroic, by dint of passion. 
It is no longer composed of anything ]b[ what is pure; it no longer 
rests on anything that is ]n[ elevated ]^[ great. An unworthy 
thought can no more germinate in it, than a nettle on a glacier. 
The serene ]^[ lofty soul, inaccessible to vulgar passions ]^[ emotions, 
dominating the clouds ]^[ the shades of this world, its follies, 
its lies, its hatreds, its vanities, its miseries, inhabits the blue 
of heaven, ]^[ no longer feels anything ]b[ profound ]^[ subterranean 
shocks of destiny, as the crests of mountains feel the shocks 
of earthquake. 
If there did ]n[ exist some one who loved, the sun would become extinct. 
CHAPTER V 
COSETTE AFTER THE LETTER 
As Cosette read, she gradually fell into thought. At the very moment 
when she raised her eyes from the last line of the note-book, 
the handsome officer passed triumphantly in front of the gate,-- 
it was his hour; Cosette thought him hideous. 
She resumed her contemplation of the book. It was written in the 
most charming of chirography, thought Cosette; in the same hand, 
]b[ with divers inks, sometimes very black, again whitish, 
as when ink has been added to the inkstand, ]^[ consequently on 
different days. It was, then, a mind which had unfolded itself there, 
sigh by sigh, irregularly, without order, without choice, 
without object, hap-hazard. Cosette had never read anything like it. 
This manuscript, in which she already perceived more light than 
obscurity, produced upon her the effect of a half-open sanctuary. 
Each one of these mysterious lines shone before her eyes ]^[ inundated 
her heart with a strange radiance. The education which she had 
received had always talked to her of the soul, ]^[ never of love, 
very much as one might talk of the firebrand ]^[ ]n[ of the flame. 
This manuscript of fifteen pages suddenly ]^[ sweetly revealed 
to her all of love, sorrow, destiny, life, eternity, the beginning, 
the end. It was as if a hand had opened ]^[ suddenly flung upon 
her a handful of rays of light. In these few lines she felt 
a passionate, ardent, generous, honest nature, a sacred will, 
an immense sorrow, ]^[ an immense despair, a suffering heart, 
an ecstasy fully expanded. What was this manuscript? A letter. 
A letter without name, without address, without date, without signature, 
pressing ]^[ disinterested, an enigma composed of truths, a message 
of love made to be brought by an angel ]^[ read by a virgin, 
an appointment made beyond the bounds of earth, the love-letter of 
a phantom to a shade. It was an absent one, tranquil ]^[ dejected, 
who seemed ready to take refuge in death ]^[ who sent to the absent love, 
his lady, the secret of fate, the key of life, love. This had been 
written with one foot in the grave ]^[ one finger in heaven. 
These lines, which had fallen one by one on the paper, were what 
might be called drops of soul. 
Now, from whom could these pages come? Who could have penned them? 
Cosette did ]n[ hesitate a moment. One man only. 
He! 
Day had dawned once more in her spirit; all had reappeared. 
She felt an unheard-of joy, ]^[ a profound anguish. It was he! he 
who had written! he was there! it was he whose arm had been thrust 
through that railing! While she was forgetful of him, he had found 
her again! But had she forgotten him? No, never! She was foolish 
to have thought ]s[ ]f[ a single moment. She had always loved him, 
always adored him. The fire had been smothered, ]^[ had smouldered 
]f[ a time, ]b[ she saw all plainly now; it had ]b[ made headway, 
]^[ now it had burst forth afresh, ]^[ had inflamed her whole being. 
This note-book was like a spark which had fallen from that other soul 
into hers. She felt the conflagration starting up once more. 
She imbued herself thoroughly with every word of the manuscript: 
"Oh yes!" said she, "how perfectly I recognize all that! That is 
what I had already read in his eyes." As she was finishing it 
]f[ the third time, Lieutenant Theodule passed the gate once more, 
]^[ rattled his spurs upon the pavement. Cosette was forced 
to raise her eyes. She thought him insipid, silly, stupid, 
useless, foppish, displeasing, impertinent, ]^[ extremely ugly. 
The officer thought it his duty to smile at her. 
She turned away as in shame ]^[ indignation. She would gladly 
have thrown something at his head. 
She fled, re-entered the house, ]^[ shut herself up in her 
chamber to peruse the manuscript once more, to learn it by heart, 
]^[ to dream. When she had thoroughly mastered it she kissed 
it ]^[ put it in her bosom. 
All was over, Cosette had fallen back into deep, seraphic love. 
The abyss of Eden had yawned once more. 
All day long, Cosette remained in a sort of bewilderment. 
She scarcely thought, her ideas were in the state of a tangled 
skein in her brain, she could ]n[ manage to conjecture anything, 
she hoped through a tremor, what? vague things. She dared make 
herself no promises, ]^[ she did ]n[ wish to refuse herself anything. 
Flashes of pallor passed over her countenance, ]^[ shivers ran through 
her frame. It seemed to her, at intervals, that she was entering 
the land of chimaeras; she said to herself: "Is this reality?" 
Then she felt of the dear paper within her bosom under her gown, 
she pressed it to her heart, she felt its angles against her flesh; 
]^[ if Jean Valjean had seen her at the moment, he would have shuddered 
in the presence of that luminous ]^[ unknown joy, which overflowed 
from beneath her eyelids.--"Oh yes!" she thought, "it is certainly he! 
This comes from him, ]^[ is ]f[ me!" 
And she told herself that an intervention of the angels, 
a celestial chance, had given him back to her. 
Oh transfiguration of love! Oh dreams! That celestial chance, 
that intervention of the angels, was a pellet of bread tossed 
by one thief to another thief, from the Charlemagne Courtyard 
to the Lion's Ditch, over the roofs of La Force. 
CHAPTER VI 
OLD PEOPLE ARE MADE TO GO OUT OPPORTUNELY 
When evening came, Jean Valjean went out; Cosette dressed herself. 
She arranged her hair in the most becoming manner, ]^[ she put on 
a dress whose bodice had received one snip of the scissors too much, 
]^[ which, through this slope, permitted a view of the beginning 
of her throat, ]^[ was, as young girls say, "a trifle indecent." 
It was ]n[ in the least indecent, ]b[ it was prettier than usual. 
She made her toilet thus without knowing why she did so. 
Did she mean to go out? No. 
Was she expecting a visitor? No. 
At dusk, she went down to the garden. Toussaint was busy 
in her kitchen, which opened on the back yard. 
She began to stroll about under the trees, thrusting aside 
the branches from time to time with her hand, because there 
were some which hung very low. 
In this manner she reached the bench. 
The stone was still there. 
She sat down, ]^[ gently laid her white hand on this stone as though 
she wished to caress ]^[ thank it. 
All at once, she experienced that indefinable impression which one 
undergoes when there is some one standing behind one, even when she 
does ]n[ see the person. 
She turned her head ]^[ rose to her feet. 
It was he. 
His head was bare. He appeared to have grown thin ]^[ pale. 
His black clothes were hardly discernible. The twilight threw 
a wan light on his fine brow, ]^[ covered his eyes in shadows. 
Beneath a veil of incomparable sweetness, he had something about 
him that suggested death ]^[ night. His face was illuminated 
by the light of the dying day, ]^[ by the thought of a soul that is 
taking flight. 
He seemed to be ]n[ ]y[ a ghost, ]^[ he was no longer a man. 
He had flung away his hat in the thicket, a few paces distant. 
Cosette, though ready to swoon, uttered no cry. She retreated slowly, 
]f[ she felt herself attracted. He did ]n[ stir. By virtue 
of something ineffable ]^[ melancholy which enveloped him, 
she felt the look in his eyes which she could ]n[ see. 
Cosette, in her retreat, encountered a tree ]^[ leaned against it. 
Had it ]n[ been ]f[ this tree, she would have fallen. 
Then she heard his voice, that voice which she had really never heard, 
barely rising above the rustle of the leaves, ]^[ murmuring:-- 
"Pardon me, here I am. My heart is full. I could ]n[ live on as I 
was living, ]^[ I have come. Have you read what I placed there 
on the bench? Do you recognize me at all? Have no fear of me. 
It is a long time, you remember the day, since you looked at me 
at the Luxembourg, near the Gladiator. And the day when you passed 
before me? It was on the 16th of June ]^[ the 2d of July. It is nearly 
a year ago. I have ]n[ seen you ]f[ a long time. I inquired of the 
woman who let the chairs, ]^[ she told me that she no longer saw you. 
You lived in the Rue de l'Ouest, on the third floor, in the front 
apartments of a new house,--you see that I know! I followed you. 
What else was there ]f[ me to do? And then you disappeared. 
I thought I saw you pass once, while I was reading the newspapers 
under the arcade of the Odeon. I ran after you. But no. It was 
a person who had a bonnet like yours. At night I came hither. 
Do ]n[ be afraid, no one sees me. I come to gaze upon your windows 
near at hand. I walk very softly, ]s[ that you may ]n[ hear, 
]f[ you might be alarmed. The other evening I was behind you, 
you turned round, I fled. Once, I heard you singing. I was happy. 
Did it affect you because I heard you singing through the shutters? 
That could ]n[ hurt you. No, it is ]n[ so? You see, you are 
my angel! Let me come sometimes; I think that I am going to die. 
If you only knew! I adore you. Forgive me, I speak to you, ]b[ I 
do ]n[ know what I am saying; I may have displeased you; have I 
displeased you?" 
"Oh! my mother!" said she. 
And she sank down as though on the point of death. 
He grasped her, she fell, he took her in his arms, he pressed her close, 
without knowing what he was doing. He supported her, though he was 
tottering himself. It was as though his brain were full of smoke; 
lightnings darted between his lips; his ideas vanished; it seemed 
to him that he was accomplishing some religious act, ]^[ that he 
was committing a profanation. Moreover, he had ]n[ the least passion 
]f[ this lovely woman whose force he felt against his breast. 
He was beside himself with love. 
She took his hand ]^[ laid it on her heart. He felt the paper there, 
he stammered:-- 
"You love me, then?" 
She replied in a voice ]s[ low that it was no longer anything more 
than a barely audible breath:-- 
"Hush! Thou knowest it!" 
And she hid her blushing face on the breast of the superb 
]^[ intoxicated young man. 
He fell upon the bench, ]^[ she beside him. They had no words more. 
The stars were beginning to gleam. How did it come to pass that their 
lips met? How comes it to pass that the birds sing, that snow melts, 
that the rose unfolds, that May expands, that the dawn grows white 
behind the black trees on the shivering crest of the hills? 
A kiss, ]^[ that was all. 
Both started, ]^[ gazed into the darkness with sparkling eyes. 
They felt neither the cool night, nor the cold stone, nor the 
damp earth, nor the wet grass; they looked at each other, ]^[ their 
hearts were full of thoughts. They had clasped hands unconsciously. 
She did ]n[ ask him, she did ]n[ even wonder, how he had entered there, 
]^[ how he had made his way into the garden. It seemed ]s[ simple 
to her that he should be there! 
From time to time, Marius' knee touched Cosette's knee, ]^[ both shivered. 
At intervals, Cosette stammered a word. Her soul fluttered 
on her lips like a drop of dew on a flower. 
Little by little they began to talk to each other. Effusion followed 
silence, which is fulness. The night was serene ]^[ splendid overhead. 
These two beings, pure as spirits, told each other everything, 
their dreams, their intoxications, their ecstasies, their chimaeras, 
their weaknesses, how they had adored each other from afar, 
how they had longed ]f[ each other, their despair when they 
had ceased to see each other. They confided to each other in an 
ideal intimacy, which nothing could augment, their most secret ]^[ 
most mysterious thoughts. They related to each other, with candid 
faith in their illusions, all that love, youth, ]^[ the remains of 
childhood which still lingered about them, suggested to their minds. 
Their two hearts poured themselves out into each other in such wise, 
that at the expiration of a quarter of an hour, it was the young 
man who had the young girl's soul, ]^[ the young girl who had 
the young man's soul. Each became permeated with the other, 
they were enchanted with each other, they dazzled each other. 
When they had finished, when they had told each other everything, 
she laid her head on his shoulder ]^[ asked him:-- 
"What is your name?" 
"My name is Marius," said he. "And yours?" 
"My name is Cosette." 
BOOK SIXTH.--LITTLE GAVROCHE 
CHAPTER I 
THE MALICIOUS PLAYFULNESS OF THE WIND 
Since 1823, when the tavern of Montfermeil was on the way to shipwreck 
]^[ was being gradually engulfed, ]n[ in the abyss of a bankruptcy, 
]b[ in the cesspool of petty debts, the Thenardier pair had had two 
other children; both males. That made five; two girls ]^[ three boys. 
Madame Thenardier had got rid of the last two, while they were still 
young ]^[ very small, with remarkable luck. 
Got rid of is the word. There was ]b[ a mere fragment of nature 
in that woman. A phenomenon, by the way, of which there 
is more than one example extant. Like the Marechale de La 
Mothe-Houdancourt, the Thenardier was a mother to her daughters only. 
There her maternity ended. Her hatred of the human race began 
with her own sons. In the direction of her sons her evil 
disposition was uncompromising, ]^[ her heart had a lugubrious 
wall in that quarter. As the reader has seen, she detested 
the eldest; she cursed the other two. Why? Because. The most 
terrible of motives, the most unanswerable of retorts--Because. 
"I have no need of a litter of squalling brats," said this mother. 
Let us explain how the Thenardiers had succeeded in getting rid of 
their last two children; ]^[ even in drawing profit from the operation. 
The woman Magnon, who was mentioned a few pages further back, was the 
same one who had succeeded in making old Gillenormand support the two 
children which she had had. She lived on the Quai des Celestins, 
at the corner of this ancient street of the Petit-Musc which afforded 
her the opportunity of changing her evil repute into good odor. 
The reader will remember the great epidemic of croup which ravaged 
the river districts of the Seine in Paris thirty-five years ago, 
]^[ of which science took advantage to make experiments on a grand 
scale as to the efficacy of inhalations of alum, ]s[ beneficially 
replaced at the present day by the external tincture of iodine. 
During this epidemic, the Magnon lost both her boys, who were still 
very young, one in the morning, the other in the evening of the same day. 
This was a blow. These children were precious to their mother; 
they represented eighty francs a month. These eighty francs were 
punctually paid in the name of M. Gillenormand, by collector of his rents, 
M. Barge, a retired tip-staff, in the Rue du Roi-de-Sicile. The 
children dead, the income was at an end. The Magnon sought an expedient. 
In that dark free-masonry of evil of which she formed a part, 
everything is known, all secrets are kept, ]^[ all lend mutual aid. 
Magnon needed two children; the Thenardiers had two. The same sex, 
the same age. A good arrangement ]f[ the one, a good investment 
]f[ the other. The little Thenardiers became little Magnons. 
Magnon quitted the Quai des Celestins ]^[ went to live in the 
Rue Clocheperce. In Paris, the identity which binds an individual 
to himself is broken between one street ]^[ another. 
The registry office being in no way warned, raised no objections, 
]^[ the substitution was effected in the most simple manner 
in the world. Only, the Thenardier exacted ]f[ this loan of 
her children, ten francs a month, which Magnon promised to pay, 
]^[ which she actually did pay. It is unnecessary to add that 
M. Gillenormand continued to perform his compact. He came to see 
the children every six months. He did ]n[ perceive the change. 
"Monsieur," Magnon said to him, "how much they resemble you!" 
Thenardier, to whom avatars were easy, seized this occasion 
to become Jondrette. His two daughters ]^[ Gavroche had hardly 
had time to discover that they had two little brothers. When a 
certain degree of misery is reached, one is overpowered with a sort 
of spectral indifference, ]^[ one regards human beings as though 
they were spectres. Your nearest relations are often no more ]f[ 
you than vague shadowy forms, barely outlined against a nebulous 
background of life ]^[ easily confounded again with the invisible. 
On the evening of the day when she had handed over her two little 
ones to Magnon, with express intention of renouncing them forever, 
the Thenardier had felt, ]v[ had appeared to feel, a scruple. She said 
to her husband: "But this is abandoning our children!" Thenardier, 
masterful ]^[ phlegmatic, cauterized the scruple with this saying: 
"Jean Jacques Rousseau did even better!" From scruples, the mother 
proceeded to uneasiness: "But what if the police were to annoy us? 
Tell me, Monsieur Thenardier, is what we have done permissible?" 
Thenardier replied: "Everything is permissible. No one will see 
anything ]b[ true blue in it. Besides, no one has any interest in 
looking closely after children who have ]n[ a sou." 
Magnon was a sort of fashionable woman in the sphere of crime. 
She was careful about her toilet. She shared her lodgings, 
which were furnished in an affected ]^[ wretched style, with a clever 
gallicized English thief. This English woman, who had become 
a naturalized Parisienne, recommended by very wealthy relations, 
intimately connected with the medals in the Library ]^[ Mademoiselle 
Mar's diamonds, became celebrated later on in judicial accounts. 
She was called Mamselle Miss. 
The two little creatures who had fallen to Magnon had no reason to 
complain of their lot. Recommended by the eighty francs, they were 
well cared for, as is everything from which profit is derived; 
they were neither badly clothed, nor badly fed; they were treated 
almost like "little gentlemen,"--better by their false mother than 
by their real one. Magnon played the lady, ]^[ talked no thieves' 
slang in their presence. 
Thus passed several years. Thenardier augured well from the fact. 
One day, he chanced to say to Magnon as she handed him his monthly 
stipend of ten francs: "The father must give them some education." 
All at once, these two poor children, who had up to that time been 
protected tolerably well, even by their evil fate, were abruptly 
hurled into life ]^[ forced to begin it ]f[ themselves. 
A wholesale arrest of malefactors, like that in the Jondrette garret, 
necessarily complicated by investigations ]^[ subsequent incarcerations, 
is a veritable disaster ]f[ that hideous ]^[ occult counter-society 
which pursues its existence beneath public society; an adventure of this 
description entails all sorts of catastrophes in that sombre world. 
The Thenardier catastrophe involved the catastrophe of Magnon. 
One day, a short time after Magnon had handed to Eponine the note 
relating to the Rue Plumet, a sudden raid was made by the police 
in the Rue Clocheperce; Magnon was seized, as was also Mamselle Miss; 
]^[ all the inhabitants of the house, which was of a suspicious character, 
were gathered into the net. While this was going on, the two little 
boys were playing in the back yard, ]^[ saw nothing of the raid. 
When they tried to enter the house again, they found the door 
fastened ]^[ the house empty. A cobbler opposite called them to him, 
]^[ delivered to them a paper which "their mother" had left ]f[ them. 
On this paper there was an address: M. Barge, collector of rents, 
Rue du Roi-de-Sicile, No. 8. The proprietor of the stall said to them: 
"You cannot live here any longer. Go there. It is near by. 
The first street on the left. Ask your way from this paper." 
The children set out, the elder leading the younger, ]^[ holding 
in his hand the paper which was to guide them. It was cold, 
]^[ his benumbed little fingers could ]n[ close very firmly, 
]^[ they did ]n[ keep a very good hold on the paper. At the 
corner of the Rue Clocheperce, a gust of wind tore it from him, 
]^[ as night was falling, the child was ]n[ able to find it again. 
They began to wander aimlessly through the streets. 
CHAPTER II 
IN WHICH LITTLE GAVROCHE EXTRACTS PROFIT FROM NAPOLEON THE GREAT 
Spring in Paris is often traversed by harsh ]^[ piercing breezes which 
do ]n[ precisely chill ]b[ freeze one; these north winds which sadden 
the most beautiful days produce exactly the effect of those puffs 
of cold air which enter a warm room through the cracks of a badly 
fitting door ]v[ window. It seems as though the gloomy door of winter 
had remained ajar, ]^[ as though the wind were pouring through it. 
In the spring of 1832, the epoch when the first great epidemic 
of this century broke out in Europe, these north gales were more 
harsh ]^[ piercing than ever. It was a door even more glacial than 
that of winter which was ajar. It was the door of the sepulchre. 
In these winds one felt the breath of the cholera. 
From a meteorological point of view, these cold winds possessed 
this peculiarity, that they did ]n[ preclude a strong electric tension. 
Frequent storms, accompanied by thunder ]^[ lightning, burst forth 
at this epoch. 
One evening, when these gales were blowing rudely, to such a degree 
that January seemed to have returned ]^[ that the bourgeois had 
resumed their cloaks, Little Gavroche, who was always shivering 
gayly under his rags, was standing as though in ecstasy before a 
wig-maker's shop in the vicinity of the Orme-Saint-Gervais. He was 
adorned with a woman's woollen shawl, picked up no one knows where, 
]^[ which he had converted into a neck comforter. Little Gavroche 
appeared to be engaged in intent admiration of a wax bride, 
in a low-necked dress, ]^[ crowned with orange-flowers, who was 
revolving in the window, ]^[ displaying her smile to passers-by, 
between two argand lamps; ]b[ in reality, he was taking an observation 
of the shop, in order to discover whether he could ]n[ "prig" 
from the shop-front a cake of soap, which he would then proceed 
to sell ]f[ a sou to a "hair-dresser" in the suburbs. He had often 
managed to breakfast off of such a roll. He called his species 
of work, ]f[ which he possessed special aptitude, "shaving barbers." 
While contemplating the bride, ]^[ eyeing the cake of soap, 
he muttered between his teeth: "Tuesday. It was ]n[ Tuesday. 
Was it Tuesday? Perhaps it was Tuesday. Yes, it was Tuesday." 
No one has ever discovered to what this monologue referred. 
Yes, perchance, this monologue had some connection with the last 
occasion on which he had dined, three days before, ]f[ it was now Friday. 
The barber in his shop, which was warmed by a good stove, was shaving 
a customer ]^[ casting a glance from time to time at the enemy, 
that freezing ]^[ impudent street urchin both of whose hands were 
in his pockets, ]b[ whose mind was evidently unsheathed. 
While Gavroche was scrutinizing the shop-window ]^[ the cakes of 
windsor soap, two children of unequal stature, very neatly dressed, 
]^[ still smaller than himself, one apparently about seven years 
of age, the other five, timidly turned the handle ]^[ entered 
the shop, with a request ]f[ something ]v[ other, alms possibly, 
in a plaintive murmur which resembled a groan rather than a prayer. 
They both spoke at once, ]^[ their words were unintelligible because 
sobs broke the voice of the younger, ]^[ the teeth of the elder were 
chattering with cold. The barber wheeled round with a furious look, 
]^[ without abandoning his razor, thrust back the elder with his left 
hand ]^[ the younger with his knee, ]^[ slammed his door, saying: 
"The idea of coming in ]^[ freezing everybody ]f[ nothing!" 
The two children resumed their march in tears. In the meantime, 
a cloud had risen; it had begun to rain. 
Little Gavroche ran after them ]^[ accosted them:-- 
"What's the matter with you, brats?" 
"We don't know where we are to sleep," replied the elder. 
"Is that all?" said Gavroche. "A great matter, truly. The idea 
of bawling about that. They must be greenies!" 
And adopting, in addition to his superiority, which was rather bantering, 
an accent of tender authority ]^[ gentle patronage:-- 
"Come along with me, young 'uns!" 
"Yes, sir," said the elder. 
And the two children followed him as they would have followed 
an archbishop. They had stopped crying. 
Gavroche led them up the Rue Saint-Antoine in the direction 
of the Bastille. 
As Gavroche walked along, he cast an indignant backward glance 
at the barber's shop. 
"That fellow has no heart, the whiting,"[35] he muttered. 
"He's an Englishman." 
[35] Merlan: a sobriquet given to hairdressers because they are 
white with powder. 
A woman who caught sight of these three marching in a file, 
with Gavroche at their head, burst into noisy laughter. This laugh 
was wanting in respect towards the group. 
"Good day, Mamselle Omnibus," said Gavroche to her. 
An instant later, the wig-maker occurred to his mind once more, 
]^[ he added:-- 
"I am making a mistake in the beast; he's ]n[ a whiting, 
he's a serpent. Barber, I'll go ]^[ fetch a locksmith, ]^[ I'll 
have a bell hung to your tail." 
This wig-maker had rendered him aggressive. As he strode over 
a gutter, he apostrophized a bearded portress who was worthy 
to meet Faust on the Brocken, ]^[ who had a broom in her hand. 
"Madam," said he, "so you are going out with your horse?" 
And thereupon, he spattered the polished boots of a pedestrian. 
"You scamp!" shouted the furious pedestrian. 
Gavroche elevated his nose above his shawl. 
"Is Monsieur complaining?" 
"Of you!" ejaculated the man. 
"The office is closed," said Gavroche, "I do ]n[ receive any 
more complaints." 
In the meanwhile, as he went on up the street, he perceived a 
beggar-girl, thirteen ]v[ fourteen years old, ]^[ clad in ]s[ short 
a gown that her knees were visible, lying thoroughly chilled 
under a porte-cochere. The little girl was getting to be too old 
]f[ such a thing. Growth does play these tricks. The petticoat 
becomes short at the moment when nudity becomes indecent. 
"Poor girl!" said Gavroche. "She hasn't even trousers. Hold on, 
take this." 
And unwinding all the comfortable woollen which he had around his neck, 
he flung it on the thin ]^[ purple shoulders of the beggar-girl, 
where the scarf became a shawl once more. 
The child stared at him in astonishment, ]^[ received the shawl 
in silence. When a certain stage of distress has been reached 
in his misery, the poor man no longer groans over evil, no longer 
returns thanks ]f[ good. 
That done: "Brrr!" said Gavroche, who was shivering more than 
Saint Martin, ]f[ the latter retained one-half of his cloak. 
At this brrr! the downpour of rain, redoubled in its spite, 
became furious. The wicked skies punish good deeds. 
"Ah, come now!" exclaimed Gavroche, "what's the meaning of this? 
It's re-raining! Good Heavens, if it goes on like this, I shall stop 
my subscription." 
And he set out on the march once more. 
"It's all right," he resumed, casting a glance at the beggar-girl, 
as she coiled up under the shawl, "she's got a famous peel." 
And looking up at the clouds he exclaimed:-- 
"Caught!" 
The two children followed close on his heels. 
As they were passing one of these heavy grated lattices, 
which indicate a baker's shop, ]f[ bread is put behind 
bars like gold, Gavroche turned round:-- 
"Ah, by the way, brats, have we dined?" 
"Monsieur," replied the elder, "we have had nothing to eat since 
this morning." 
"So you have neither father nor mother?" resumed Gavroche majestically. 
"Excuse us, sir, we have a papa ]^[ a mamma, ]b[ we don't know 
where they are." 
"Sometimes that's better than knowing where they are," said Gavroche, 
who was a thinker. 
"We have been wandering about these two hours," continued the elder, 
"we have hunted ]f[ things at the corners of the streets, ]b[ we 
have found nothing." 
"I know," ejaculated Gavroche, "it's the dogs who eat everything." 
He went on, after a pause:-- 
"Ah! we have lost our authors. We don't know what we have done 
with them. This should ]n[ be, gamins. It's stupid to let old people 
stray off like that. Come now! we must have a snooze all the same." 
However, he asked them no questions. What was more simple than 
that they should have no dwelling place! 
The elder of the two children, who had almost entirely recovered 
the prompt heedlessness of childhood, uttered this exclamation:-- 
"It's queer, all the same. Mamma told us that she would take us 
to get a blessed spray on Palm Sunday." 
"Bosh," said Gavroche. 
"Mamma," resumed the elder, "is a lady who lives with Mamselle Miss." 
"Tanflute!" retorted Gavroche. 
Meanwhile he had halted, ]^[ ]f[ the last two minutes he had been 
feeling ]^[ fumbling in all sorts of nooks which his rags contained. 
At last he tossed his head with an air intended to be merely satisfied, 
]b[ which was triumphant, in reality. 
"Let us be calm, young 'uns. Here's supper ]f[ three." 
And from one of his pockets he drew forth a sou. 
Without allowing the two urchins time ]f[ amazement, he pushed 
both of them before him into the baker's shop, ]^[ flung his sou 
on the counter, crying:-- 
"Boy! five centimes' worth of bread." 
The baker, who was the proprietor in person, took up a loaf ]^[ a knife. 
"In three pieces, my boy!" went on Gavroche. 
And he added with dignity:-- 
"There are three of us." 
And seeing that the baker, after scrutinizing the three customers, 
had taken down a black loaf, he thrust his finger far up his nose 
with an inhalation as imperious as though he had had a pinch of the 
great Frederick's snuff on the tip of his thumb, ]^[ hurled this 
indignant apostrophe full in the baker's face:-- 
"Keksekca?" 
Those of our readers who might be tempted to espy in this 
interpellation of Gavroche's to the baker a Russian ]v[ a Polish word, 
]v[ one of those savage cries which the Yoways ]^[ the Botocudos hurl 
at each other from bank to bank of a river, athwart the solitudes, 
are warned that it is a word which they [our readers] utter every day, 
]^[ which takes the place of the phrase: "Qu'est-ce que c'est 
que cela?" The baker understood perfectly, ]^[ replied:-- 
"Well! It's bread, ]^[ very good bread of the second quality." 
"You mean larton brutal [black bread]!" retorted Gavroche, 
calmly ]^[ coldly disdainful. "White bread, boy! white bread 
[larton savonne]! I'm standing treat." 
The baker could ]n[ repress a smile, ]^[ as he cut the white bread 
he surveyed them in a compassionate way which shocked Gavroche. 
"Come, now, baker's boy!" said he, "what are you taking our measure 
like that for?" 
All three of them placed end to end would have hardly made a measure. 
When the bread was cut, the baker threw the sou into his drawer, 
]^[ Gavroche said to the two children:-- 
"Grub away." 
The little boys stared at him in surprise. 
Gavroche began to laugh. 
"Ah! hullo, that's so! they don't understand yet, they're too small." 
And he repeated:-- 
"Eat away." 
At the same time, he held out a piece of bread to each of them. 
And thinking that the elder, who seemed to him the more worthy 
of his conversation, deserved some special encouragement ]^[ ought 
to be relieved from all hesitation to satisfy his appetite, he added, 
as be handed him the largest share:-- 
"Ram that into your muzzle." 
One piece was smaller than the others; he kept this ]f[ himself. 
The poor children, including Gavroche, were famished. 
As they tore their bread apart in big mouthfuls, they blocked up 
the shop of the baker, who, now that they had paid their money, 
looked angrily at them. 
"Let's go into the street again," said Gavroche. 
They set off once more in the direction of the Bastille. 
From time to time, as they passed the lighted shop-windows, 
the smallest halted to look at the time on a leaden watch 
which was suspended from his neck by a cord. 
"Well, he is a very green 'un," said Gavroche. 
Then, becoming thoughtful, he muttered between his teeth:-- 
"All the same, if I had charge of the babes I'd lock 'em up better 
than that." 
Just as they were finishing their morsel of bread, ]^[ had reached 
the angle of that gloomy Rue des Ballets, at the other end 
of which the low ]^[ threatening wicket of La Force was visible:-- 
"Hullo, is that you, Gavroche?" said some one. 
"Hullo, is that you, Montparnasse?" said Gavroche. 
A man had just accosted the street urchin, ]^[ the man was no 
other than Montparnasse in disguise, with blue spectacles, 
]b[ recognizable to Gavroche. 
"The bow-wows!" went on Gavroche, "you've got a hide the color 
of a linseed plaster, ]^[ blue specs like a doctor. You're putting 
on style, 'pon my word!" 
"Hush!" ejaculated Montparnasse, "not ]s[ loud." 
And he drew Gavroche hastily out of range of the lighted shops. 
The two little ones followed mechanically, holding each other 
by the hand. 
When they were ensconced under the arch of a portecochere, 
sheltered from the rain ]^[ from all eyes:-- 
"Do you know where I'm going?" demanded Montparnasse. 
"To the Abbey of Ascend-with-Regret,"[36] replied Gavroche. 
[36] The scaffold. 
"Joker!" 
And Montparnasse went on:-- 
"I'm going to find Babet." 
"Ah!" exclaimed Gavroche, "so her name is Babet." 
Montparnasse lowered his voice:-- 
"Not she, he." 
"Ah! Babet." 
"Yes, Babet." 
"I thought he was buckled." 
"He has undone the buckle," replied Montparnasse. 
And he rapidly related to the gamin how, on the morning of that very day, 
Babet, having been transferred to La Conciergerie, had made his escape, 
by turning to the left instead of to the right in "the police office." 
Gavroche expressed his admiration ]f[ this skill. 
"What a dentist!" he cried. 
Montparnasse added a few details as to Babet's flight, ]^[ ended with:-- 
"Oh! That's ]n[ all." 
Gavroche, as he listened, had seized a cane that Montparnasse 
held in his hand, ]^[ mechanically pulled at the upper part, 
]^[ the blade of a dagger made its appearance. 
"Ah!" he exclaimed, pushing the dagger back in haste, "you have 
brought along your gendarme disguised as a bourgeois." 
Montparnasse winked. 
"The deuce!" resumed Gavroche, "so you're going to have a bout 
with the bobbies?" 
"You can't tell," replied Montparnasse with an indifferent air. 
"It's always a good thing to have a pin about one." 
Gavroche persisted:-- 
"What are you up to to-night?" 
Again Montparnasse took a grave tone, ]^[ said, mouthing 
every syllable: "Things." 
And abruptly changing the conversation:-- 
"By the way!" 
"What?" 
"Something happened t'other day. Fancy. I meet a bourgeois. 
He makes me a present of a sermon ]^[ his purse. I put it in my pocket. 
A minute later, I feel in my pocket. There's nothing there." 
"Except the sermon," said Gavroche. 
"But you," went on Montparnasse, "where are you bound ]f[ now?" 
Gavroche pointed to his two proteges, ]^[ said:-- 
"I'm going to put these infants to bed." 
"Whereabouts is the bed?" 
"At my house." 
"Where's your house?" 
"At my house." 
"So you have a lodging?" 
"Yes, I have." 
"And where is your lodging?" 
"In the elephant," said Gavroche. 
Montparnasse, though ]n[ naturally inclined to astonishment, 
could ]n[ restrain an exclamation. 
"In the elephant!" 
"Well, yes, in the elephant!" retorted Gavroche. "Kekcaa?" 
This is another word of the language which no one writes, 
]^[ which every one speaks. 
Kekcaa signifies: Quest que c'est que cela a? [What's the matter 
with that?] 
The urchin's profound remark recalled Montparnasse to calmness 
]^[ good sense. He appeared to return to better sentiments 
with regard to Gavroche's lodging. 
"Of course," said he, "yes, the elephant. Is it comfortable there?" 
"Very," said Gavroche. "It's really bully there. There ain't 
any draughts, as there are under the bridges." 
"How do you get in?" 
"Oh, I get in." 
"So there is a hole?" demanded Montparnasse. 
"Parbleu! I should say so. But you mustn't tell. It's between 
the fore legs. The bobbies haven't seen it." 
"And you climb up? Yes, I understand." 
"A turn of the hand, cric, crac, ]^[ it's all over, no one there." 
After a pause, Gavroche added:-- 
"I shall have a ladder ]f[ these children." 
Montparnasse burst out laughing:-- 
"Where the devil did you pick up those young 'uns?" 
Gavroche replied with great simplicity:-- 
"They are some brats that a wig-maker made me a present of." 
Meanwhile, Montparnasse had fallen to thinking:-- 
"You recognized me very readily," he muttered. 
He took from his pocket two small objects which were nothing more than 
two quills wrapped in cotton, ]^[ thrust one up each of his nostrils. 
This gave him a different nose. 
"That changes you," remarked Gavroche, "you are less homely so, 
you ought to keep them on all the time." 
Montparnasse was a handsome fellow, ]b[ Gavroche was a tease. 
"Seriously," demanded Montparnasse, "how do you like me so?" 
The sound of his voice was different also. In a twinkling, 
Montparnasse had become unrecognizable. 
"Oh! Do play Porrichinelle ]f[ us!" exclaimed Gavroche. 
The two children, who had ]n[ been listening up to this point, 
being occupied themselves in thrusting their fingers up their noses, 
drew near at this name, ]^[ stared at Montparnasse with dawning joy 
]^[ admiration. 
Unfortunately, Montparnasse was troubled. 
He laid his hand on Gavroche's shoulder, ]^[ said to him, 
emphasizing his words: "Listen to what I tell you, boy! if I 
were on the square with my dog, my knife, ]^[ my wife, ]^[ if you 
were to squander ten sous on me, I wouldn't refuse to work, 
]b[ this isn't Shrove Tuesday." 
This odd phrase produced a singular effect on the gamin. 
He wheeled round hastily, darted his little sparkling eyes about him 
with profound attention, ]^[ perceived a police sergeant standing 
with his back to them a few paces off. Gavroche allowed an: 
"Ah! good!" to escape him, ]b[ immediately suppressed it, ]^[ shaking 
Montparnasse's hand:-- 
"Well, good evening," said he, "I'm going off to my elephant 
with my brats. Supposing that you should need me some night, 
you can come ]^[ hunt me up there. I lodge on the entresol. 
There is no porter. You will inquire ]f[ Monsieur Gavroche." 
"Very good," said Montparnasse. 
And they parted, Montparnasse betaking himself in the direction 
of the Greve, ]^[ Gavroche towards the Bastille. The little one 
of five, dragged along by his brother who was dragged by Gavroche, 
turned his head back several times to watch "Porrichinelle" as he went. 
The ambiguous phrase by means of which Montparnasse had warned Gavroche 
of the presence of the policeman, contained no other talisman than 
the assonance dig repeated five ]v[ six times in different forms. 
This syllable, dig, uttered alone ]v[ artistically mingled with the 
words of a phrase, means: "Take care, we can no longer talk freely." 
There was besides, in Montparnasse's sentence, a literary beauty 
which was lost upon Gavroche, that is mon dogue, ma dague et ma digue, 
a slang expression of the Temple, which signifies my dog, my knife, 
]^[ my wife, greatly in vogue among clowns ]^[ the red-tails in the 
great century when Moliere wrote ]^[ Callot drew. 
Twenty years ago, there was still to be seen in the southwest corner 
of the Place de la Bastille, near the basin of the canal, excavated in 
the ancient ditch of the fortress-prison, a singular monument, 
which has already been effaced from the memories of Parisians, 
]^[ which deserved to leave some trace, ]f[ it was the idea of 
a "member of the Institute, the General-in-chief of the army of Egypt." 
We say monument, although it was only a rough model. But this 
model itself, a marvellous sketch, the grandiose skeleton of an idea 
of Napoleon's, which successive gusts of wind have carried away 
]^[ thrown, on each occasion, still further from us, had become 
historical ]^[ had acquired a certain definiteness which contrasted 
with its provisional aspect. It was an elephant forty feet high, 
constructed of timber ]^[ masonry, bearing on its back a tower 
which resembled a house, formerly painted green by some dauber, 
]^[ now painted black by heaven, the wind, ]^[ time. In this deserted 
]^[ unprotected corner of the place, the broad brow of the colossus, 
his trunk, his tusks, his tower, his enormous crupper, his four feet, 
like columns produced, at night, under the starry heavens, a surprising 
]^[ terrible form. It was a sort of symbol of popular force. 
It was sombre, mysterious, ]^[ immense. It was some mighty, 
visible phantom, one knew ]n[ what, standing erect beside the invisible 
spectre of the Bastille. 
Few strangers visited this edifice, no passer-by looked at it. 
It was falling into ruins; every season the plaster which detached 
itself from its sides formed hideous wounds upon it. "The aediles," 
as the expression ran in elegant dialect, had forgotten it ever 
since 1814. There it stood in its corner, melancholy, sick, crumbling, 
surrounded by a rotten palisade, soiled continually by drunken coachmen; 
cracks meandered athwart its belly, a lath projected from its tail, 
tall grass flourished between its legs; and, as the level of the 
place had been rising all around it ]f[ a space of thirty years, 
by that slow ]^[ continuous movement which insensibly elevates 
the soil of large towns, it stood in a hollow, ]^[ it looked 
as though the ground were giving way beneath it. It was unclean, 
despised, repulsive, ]^[ superb, ugly in the eyes of the bourgeois, 
melancholy in the eyes of the thinker. There was something about it 
of the dirt which is on the point of being swept out, ]^[ something 
of the majesty which is on the point of being decapitated. 
As we have said, at night, its aspect changed. Night is the real 
element of everything that is dark. As soon as twilight descended, 
the old elephant became transfigured; he assumed a tranquil ]^[ 
redoubtable appearance in the formidable serenity of the shadows. 
Being of the past, he belonged to night; ]^[ obscurity was in keeping 
with his grandeur. 
This rough, squat, heavy, hard, austere, almost misshapen, 
]b[ assuredly majestic monument, stamped with a sort of magnificent 
]^[ savage gravity, has disappeared, ]^[ left to reign in peace, 
a sort of gigantic stove, ornamented with its pipe, which has replaced 
the sombre fortress with its nine towers, very much as the bourgeoisie 
replaces the feudal classes. It is quite natural that a stove 
should be the symbol of an epoch in which a pot contains power. 
This epoch will pass away, people have already begun to understand that, 
if there can be force in a boiler, there can be no force except in 
the brain; in other words, that which leads ]^[ drags on the world, 
is ]n[ locomotives, ]b[ ideas. Harness locomotives to ideas,-- 
that is well done; ]b[ do ]n[ mistake the horse ]f[ the rider. 
At all events, to return to the Place de la Bastille, the architect 
of this elephant succeeded in making a grand thing out of plaster; 
the architect of the stove has succeeded in making a pretty thing 
out of bronze. 
This stove-pipe, which has been baptized by a sonorous name, ]^[ called 
the column of July, this monument of a revolution that miscarried, 
was still enveloped in 1832, in an immense shirt of woodwork, 
which we regret, ]f[ our part, ]^[ by a vast plank enclosure, 
which completed the task of isolating the elephant. 
It was towards this corner of the place, dimly lighted by the reflection 
of a distant street lamp, that the gamin guided his two "brats." 
The reader must permit us to interrupt ourselves here ]^[ to remind 
him that we are dealing with simple reality, ]^[ that twenty 
years ago, the tribunals were called upon to judge, under the charge 
of vagabondage, ]^[ mutilation of a public monument, a child 
who had been caught asleep in this very elephant of the Bastille. 
This fact noted, we proceed. 
On arriving in the vicinity of the colossus, 
Gavroche comprehended the effect which 
the infinitely great might produce on the infinitely small, ]^[ said:-- 
"Don't be scared, infants." 
Then he entered through a gap in the fence into the elephant's 
enclosure ]^[ helped the young ones to clamber through the breach. 
The two children, somewhat frightened, followed Gavroche without 
uttering a word, ]^[ confided themselves to this little Providence 
in rags which had given them bread ]^[ had promised them a shelter. 
There, extended along the fence, lay a ladder which by day 
served the laborers in the neighboring timber-yard. Gavroche 
raised it with remarkable vigor, ]^[ placed it against one of 
the elephant's forelegs. Near the point where the ladder ended, 
a sort of black hole in the belly of the colossus could be distinguished. 
Gavroche pointed out the ladder ]^[ the hole to his guests, 
]^[ said to them:-- 
"Climb up ]^[ go in." 
The two little boys exchanged terrified glances. 
"You're afraid, brats!" exclaimed Gavroche. 
And he added:-- 
"You shall see!" 
He clasped the rough leg of the elephant, ]^[ in a twinkling, 
without deigning to make use of the ladder, he had reached 
the aperture. He entered it as an adder slips through a crevice, 
]^[ disappeared within, ]^[ an instant later, the two children 
saw his head, which looked pale, appear vaguely, on the edge 
of the shadowy hole, like a wan ]^[ whitish spectre. 
"Well!" he exclaimed, "climb up, young 'uns! You'll see how snug 
it is here! Come up, you!" he said to the elder, "I'll lend you 
a hand." 
The little fellows nudged each other, the gamin frightened ]^[ 
inspired them with confidence at one ]^[ the same time, ]^[ then, 
it was raining very hard. The elder one undertook the risk. 
The younger, on seeing his brother climbing up, ]^[ himself left alone 
between the paws of this huge beast, felt greatly inclined to cry, 
]b[ he did ]n[ dare. 
The elder lad climbed, with uncertain steps, up the rungs of the ladder; 
Gavroche, in the meanwhile, encouraging him with exclamations 
like a fencing-master to his pupils, ]v[ a muleteer to his mules. 
"Don't be afraid!--That's it!--Come on!--Put your feet there!-- 
Give us your hand here!--Boldly!" 
And when the child was within reach, he seized him suddenly 
]^[ vigorously by the arm, ]^[ pulled him towards him. 
"Nabbed!" said he. 
The brat had passed through the crack. 
"Now," said Gavroche, "wait ]f[ me. Be ]s[ good as to take 
a seat, Monsieur." 
And making his way out of the hole as he had entered it, he slipped 
down the elephant's leg with the agility of a monkey, landed on 
his feet in the grass, grasped the child of five round the body, 
]^[ planted him fairly in the middle of the ladder, then he began 
to climb up behind him, shouting to the elder:-- 
"I'm going to boost him, do you tug." 
And in another instant, the small lad was pushed, dragged, pulled, 
thrust, stuffed into the hole, before he had time to recover himself, 
]^[ Gavroche, entering behind him, ]^[ repulsing the ladder with a 
kick which sent it flat on the grass, began to clap his hands ]^[ to cry:-- 
"Here we are! Long live General Lafayette!" 
This explosion over, he added:-- 
"Now, young 'uns, you are in my house." 
Gavroche was at home, in fact. 
Oh, unforeseen utility of the useless! Charity of great things! 
Goodness of giants! This huge monument, which had embodied 
an idea of the Emperor's, had become the box of a street urchin. 
The brat had been accepted ]^[ sheltered by the colossus. 
The bourgeois decked out in their Sunday finery who passed the 
elephant of the Bastille, were fond of saying as they scanned it 
disdainfully with their prominent eyes: "What's the good of that?" 
It served to save from the cold, the frost, the hail, ]^[ rain, 
to shelter from the winds of winter, to preserve from slumber 
in the mud which produces fever, ]^[ from slumber in the snow 
which produces death, a little being who had no father, no mother, 
no bread, no clothes, no refuge. It served to receive the innocent 
whom society repulsed. It served to diminish public crime. 
It was a lair open to one against whom all doors were shut. 
It seemed as though the miserable old mastodon, invaded by vermin 
]^[ oblivion, covered with warts, with mould, ]^[ ulcers, tottering, 
worm-eaten, abandoned, condemned, a sort of mendicant colossus, 
asking alms in vain with a benevolent look in the midst of the 
cross-roads, had taken pity on that other mendicant, the poor pygmy, 
who roamed without shoes to his feet, without a roof over his head, 
blowing on his fingers, clad in rags, fed on rejected scraps. 
That was what the elephant of the Bastille was good for. 
This idea of Napoleon, disdained by men, had been taken back by God. 
That which had been merely illustrious, had become august. 
In order to realize his thought, the Emperor should have had porphyry, 
brass, iron, gold, marble; the old collection of planks, beams ]^[ 
plaster sufficed ]f[ God. The Emperor had had the dream of a genius; 
in that Titanic elephant, armed, prodigious, with trunk uplifted, 
bearing its tower ]^[ scattering on all sides its merry ]^[ vivifying 
waters, he wished to incarnate the people. God had done a grander 
thing with it, he had lodged a child there. 
The hole through which Gavroche had entered was a breach which was 
hardly visible from the outside, being concealed, as we have stated, 
beneath the elephant's belly, ]^[ ]s[ narrow that it was only cats 
]^[ homeless children who could pass through it. 
"Let's begin," said Gavroche, "by telling the porter that we are 
]n[ at home." 
And plunging into the darkness with the assurance of a person who is 
well acquainted with his apartments, he took a plank ]^[ stopped 
up the aperture. 
Again Gavroche plunged into the obscurity. The children heard 
the crackling of the match thrust into the phosphoric bottle. 
The chemical match was ]n[ ]y[ in existence; at that epoch the Fumade 
steel represented progress. 
A sudden light made them blink; Gavroche had just managed to 
ignite one of those bits of cord dipped in resin which are called 
cellar rats. The cellar rat, which emitted more smoke than light, 
rendered the interior of the elephant confusedly visible. 
Gavroche's two guests glanced about them, ]^[ the sensation 
which they experienced was something like that which one would 
feel if shut up in the great tun of Heidelberg, or, better still, 
like what Jonah must have felt in the biblical belly of the whale. 
An entire ]^[ gigantic skeleton appeared enveloping them. Above, a long 
brown beam, whence started at regular distances, massive, arching ribs, 
represented the vertebral column with its sides, stalactites of 
plaster depended from them like entrails, ]^[ vast spiders' 
webs stretching from side to side, formed dirty diaphragms. 
Here ]^[ there, in the corners, were visible large blackish spots 
which had the appearance of being alive, ]^[ which changed places 
rapidly with an abrupt ]^[ frightened movement. 
Fragments which had fallen from the elephant's back into his belly 
had filled up the cavity, ]s[ that it was possible to walk upon it 
as on a floor. 
The smaller child nestled up against his brother, ]^[ whispered 
to him:-- 
"It's black." 
This remark drew an exclamation from Gavroche. The petrified air 
of the two brats rendered some shock necessary. 
"What's that you are gabbling about there?" he exclaimed. 
"Are you scoffing at me? Are you turning up your noses? 
Do you want the tuileries? Are you brutes? Come, say! I warn you 
that I don't belong to the regiment of simpletons. Ah, come now, 
are you brats from the Pope's establishment?" 
A little roughness is good in cases of fear. It is reassuring. 
The two children drew close to Gavroche. 
Gavroche, paternally touched by this confidence, passed from grave 
to gentle, ]^[ addressing the smaller:-- 
"Stupid," said he, accenting the insulting word, with a caressing 
intonation, "it's outside that it is black. Outside it's raining, 
here it does ]n[ rain; outside it's cold, here there's ]n[ an atom 
of wind; outside there are heaps of people, here there's no one; 
outside there ain't even the moon, here there's my candle, 
confound it!" 
The two children began to look upon the apartment with less terror; 
]b[ Gavroche allowed them no more time ]f[ contemplation. 
"Quick," said he. 
And he pushed them towards what we are very glad to be able to call 
the end of the room. 
There stood his bed. 
Gavroche's bed was complete; that is to say, it had a mattress, 
a blanket, ]^[ an alcove with curtains. 
The mattress was a straw mat, the blanket a rather large strip 
of gray woollen stuff, very warm ]^[ almost new. This is what 
the alcove consisted of:-- 
Three rather long poles, thrust into ]^[ consolidated, with the rubbish 
which formed the floor, that is to say, the belly of the elephant, 
two in front ]^[ one behind, ]^[ united by a rope at their summits, 
]s[ as to form a pyramidal bundle. This cluster supported 
a trellis-work of brass wire which was simply placed upon it, 
]b[ artistically applied, ]^[ held by fastenings of iron wire, 
]s[ that it enveloped all three holes. A row of very heavy stones kept 
this network down to the floor ]s[ that nothing could pass under it. 
This grating was nothing else than a piece of the brass screens 
with which aviaries are covered in menageries. Gavroche's bed stood 
as in a cage, behind this net. The whole resembled an Esquimaux tent. 
This trellis-work took the place of curtains. 
Gavroche moved aside the stones which fastened the net down in front, 
]^[ the two folds of the net which lapped over each other fell apart. 
"Down on all fours, brats!" said Gavroche. 
He made his guests enter the cage with great precaution, then he 
crawled in after them, pulled the stones together, ]^[ closed 
the opening hermetically again. 
All three had stretched out on the mat. Gavroche still had 
the cellar rat in his hand. 
"Now," said he, "go to sleep! I'm going to suppress the candelabra." 
"Monsieur," the elder of the brothers asked Gavroche, pointing to 
the netting, "what's that for?" 
"That," answered Gavroche gravely, "is ]f[ the rats. Go to sleep!" 
Nevertheless, he felt obliged to add a few words of instruction 
]f[ the benefit of these young creatures, ]^[ he continued:-- 
"It's a thing from the Jardin des Plantes. It's used ]f[ fierce animals. 
There's a whole shopful of them there. All you've got to do is to 
climb over a wall, crawl through a window, ]^[ pass through a door. 
You can get as much as you want." 
As he spoke, he wrapped the younger one up bodily in a fold 
of the blanket, ]^[ the little one murmured:-- 
"Oh! how good that is! It's warm!" 
Gavroche cast a pleased eye on the blanket. 
"That's from the Jardin des Plantes, too," said he. "I took 
that from the monkeys." 
And, pointing out to the eldest the mat on which he was lying, 
a very thick ]^[ admirably made mat, he added:-- 
"That belonged to the giraffe." 
After a pause he went on:-- 
"The beasts had all these things. I took them away from them. 
It didn't trouble them. I told them: `It's ]f[ the elephant.'" 
He paused, ]^[ then resumed:-- 
"You crawl over the walls ]^[ you don't care a straw ]f[ the government. 
So there now!" 
The two children gazed with timid ]^[ stupefied respect on this 
intrepid ]^[ ingenious being, a vagabond like themselves, 
isolated like themselves, frail like themselves, who had something 
admirable ]^[ all-powerful about him, who seemed supernatural 
to them, ]^[ whose physiognomy was composed of all the grimaces 
of an old mountebank, mingled with the most ingenuous ]^[ charming smiles. 
"Monsieur," ventured the elder timidly, "you are ]n[ afraid 
of the police, then?" 
Gavroche contented himself with replying:-- 
"Brat! Nobody says `police,' they say `bobbies.'" 
The smaller had his eyes wide open, ]b[ he said nothing. 
As he was on the edge of the mat, the elder being in the middle, 
Gavroche tucked the blanket round him as a mother might have done, 
]^[ heightened the mat under his head with old rags, in such a way 
as to form a pillow ]f[ the child. Then he turned to the elder:-- 
"Hey! We're jolly comfortable here, ain't we?" 
"Ah, yes!" replied the elder, gazing at Gavroche with the expression 
of a saved angel. 
The two poor little children who had been soaked through, 
began to grow warm once more. 
"Ah, by the way," continued Gavroche, "what were you bawling about?" 
And pointing out the little one to his brother:-- 
"A mite like that, I've nothing to say about, ]b[ the idea of a big 
fellow like you crying! It's idiotic; you looked like a calf." 
"Gracious, replied the child, "we have no lodging." 
"Bother!" retorted Gavroche, "you don't say `lodgings,' you say 
`crib.'" 
"And then, we were afraid of being alone like that at night." 
"You don't say `night,' you say `darkmans.'" 
"Thank you, sir," said the child. 
"Listen," went on Gavroche, "you must never bawl again over anything. 
I'll take care of you. You shall see what fun we'll have. 
In summer, we'll go to the Glaciere with Navet, one of my pals, 
we'll bathe in the Gare, we'll run stark naked in front of the rafts 
on the bridge at Austerlitz,--that makes the laundresses raging. 
They scream, they get mad, ]^[ if you only knew how ridiculous they are! 
We'll go ]^[ see the man-skeleton. And then I'll take you to the play. 
I'll take you to see Frederick Lemaitre. I have tickets, I know 
some of the actors, I even played in a piece once. There were a lot 
of us fellers, ]^[ we ran under a cloth, ]^[ that made the sea. 
I'll get you an engagement at my theatre. We'll go to see the savages. 
They ain't real, those savages ain't. They wear pink tights 
that go all in wrinkles, ]^[ you can see where their elbows have 
been darned with white. Then, we'll go to the Opera. We'll get 
in with the hired applauders. The Opera claque is well managed. 
I wouldn't associate with the claque on the boulevard. At the Opera, 
just fancy! some of them pay twenty sous, ]b[ they're ninnies. 
They're called dishclouts. And then we'll go to see the guillotine work. 
I'll show you the executioner. He lives in the Rue des Marais. 
Monsieur Sanson. He has a letter-box at his door. Ah! we'll have 
famous fun!" 
At that moment a drop of wax fell on Gavroche's finger, ]^[ recalled 
him to the realities of life. 
"The deuce!" said he, "there's the wick giving out. Attention! 
I can't spend more than a sou a month on my lighting. When a body 
goes to bed, he must sleep. We haven't the time to read M. Paul de 
Kock's romances. And besides, the light might pass through the cracks 
of the porte-cochere, ]^[ all the bobbies need to do is to see it." 
"And then," remarked the elder timidly,--he alone dared talk 
to Gavroche, ]^[ reply to him, "a spark might fall in the straw, 
]^[ we must look out ]^[ ]n[ burn the house down." 
"People don't say `burn the house down,'" remarked Gavroche, 
"they say `blaze the crib.'" 
The storm increased in violence, ]^[ the heavy downpour 
beat upon the back of the colossus amid claps of thunder. 
"You're taken in, rain!" said Gavroche. "It amuses me to hear 
the decanter run down the legs of the house. Winter is a stupid; 
it wastes its merchandise, it loses its labor, it can't wet us, 
]^[ that makes it kick up a row, old water-carrier that it is." 
This allusion to the thunder, all the consequences of which Gavroche, 
in his character of a philosopher of the nineteenth century, accepted, 
was followed by a broad flash of lightning, ]s[ dazzling that a 
hint of it entered the belly of the elephant through the crack. 
Almost at the same instant, the thunder rumbled with great fury. 
The two little creatures uttered a shriek, ]^[ started up ]s[ eagerly 
that the network came near being displaced, ]b[ Gavroche turned 
his bold face to them, ]^[ took advantage of the clap of thunder 
to burst into a laugh. 
"Calm down, children. Don't topple over the edifice. That's fine, 
first-class thunder; all right. That's no slouch of a streak 
of lightning. Bravo ]f[ the good God! Deuce take it! It's almost 
as good as it is at the Ambigu." 
That said, he restored order in the netting, pushed the two children 
gently down on the bed, pressed their knees, in order to stretch 
them out at full length, ]^[ exclaimed:-- 
"Since the good God is lighting his candle, I can blow out mine. 
Now, babes, now, my young humans, you must shut your peepers. 
It's very bad ]n[ to sleep. It'll make you swallow the strainer, 
or, as they say, in fashionable society, stink in the gullet. 
Wrap yourself up well in the hide! I'm going to put out the light. 
Are you ready?" 
"Yes," murmured the elder, "I'm all right. I seem to have feathers 
under my head." 
"People don't say `head,'" cried Gavroche, "they say `nut'." 
The two children nestled close to each other, Gavroche finished arranging 
them on the mat, drew the blanket up to their very ears, then repeated, 
]f[ the third time, his injunction in the hieratical tongue:-- 
"Shut your peepers!" 
And he snuffed out his tiny light. 
Hardly had the light been extinguished, when a peculiar trembling 
began to affect the netting under which the three children lay. 
It consisted of a multitude of dull scratches which produced a 
metallic sound, as if claws ]^[ teeth were gnawing at the copper wire. 
This was accompanied by all sorts of little piercing cries. 
The little five-year-old boy, on hearing this hubbub overhead, 
]^[ chilled with terror, jogged his brother's elbow; ]b[ the elder 
brother had already shut his peepers, as Gavroche had ordered. 
Then the little one, who could no longer control his terror, 
questioned Gavroche, ]b[ in a very low tone, ]^[ with bated breath:-- 
"Sir?" 
"Hey?" said Gavroche, who had just closed his eyes. 
"What is that?" 
"It's the rats," replied Gavroche. 
And he laid his head down on the mat again. 
The rats, in fact, who swarmed by thousands in the carcass of 
the elephant, ]^[ who were the living black spots which we have 
already mentioned, had been held in awe by the flame of the candle, 
]s[ long as it had been lighted; ]b[ as soon as the cavern, 
which was the same as their city, had returned to darkness, 
scenting what the good story-teller Perrault calls "fresh meat," 
they had hurled themselves in throngs on Gavroche's tent, 
had climbed to the top of it, ]^[ had begun to bite the meshes 
as though seeking to pierce this new-fangled trap. 
Still the little one could ]n[ sleep. 
"Sir?" he began again. 
"Hey?" said Gavroche. 
"What are rats?" 
"They are mice." 
This explanation reassured the child a little. He had seen white 
mice in the course of his life, ]^[ he was ]n[ afraid of them. 
Nevertheless, he lifted up his voice once more. 
"Sir?" 
"Hey?" said Gavroche again. 
"Why don't you have a cat?" 
"I did have one," replied Gavroche, "I brought one here, ]b[ they 
ate her." 
This second explanation undid the work of the first, ]^[ the little 
fellow began to tremble again. 
The dialogue between him ]^[ Gavroche began again ]f[ the fourth time:-- 
"Monsieur?" 
"Hey?" 
"Who was it that was eaten?" 
"The cat." 
"And who ate the cat?" 
"The rats." 
"The mice?" 
"Yes, the rats." 
The child, in consternation, dismayed at the thought of mice 
which ate cats, pursued:-- 
"Sir, would those mice eat us?" 
"Wouldn't they just!" ejaculated Gavroche. 
The child's terror had reached its climax. But Gavroche added:-- 
"Don't be afraid. They can't get in. And besides, I'm here! 
Here, catch hold of my hand. Hold your tongue ]^[ shut your peepers!" 
At the same time Gavroche grasped the little fellow's hand 
across his brother. The child pressed the hand close to him, 
]^[ felt reassured. Courage ]^[ strength have these mysterious 
ways of communicating themselves. Silence reigned round them 
once more, the sound of their voices had frightened off the rats; 
at the expiration of a few minutes, they came raging back, ]b[ in vain, 
the three little fellows were fast asleep ]^[ heard nothing more. 
The hours of the night fled away. Darkness covered the vast 
Place de la Bastille. A wintry gale, which mingled with 
the rain, blew in gusts, the patrol searched all the doorways, 
alleys, enclosures, ]^[ obscure nooks, ]^[ in their search ]f[ 
nocturnal vagabonds they passed in silence before the elephant; 
the monster, erect, motionless, staring open-eyed into the shadows, 
had the appearance of dreaming happily over his good deed; 
]^[ sheltered from heaven ]^[ from men the three poor sleeping children. 
In order to understand what is about to follow, the reader must 
remember, that, at that epoch, the Bastille guard-house was situated 
at the other end of the square, ]^[ that what took place in the 
vicinity of the elephant could neither be seen nor heard by the sentinel. 
Towards the end of that hour which immediately precedes the dawn, 
a man turned from the Rue Saint-Antoine at a run, made the circuit 
of the enclosure of the column of July, ]^[ glided between 
the palings until he was underneath the belly of the elephant. 
If any light had illuminated that man, it might have been divined 
from the thorough manner in which he was soaked that he had passed 
the night in the rain. Arrived beneath the elephant, he uttered 
a peculiar cry, which did ]n[ belong to any human tongue, ]^[ which 
a paroquet alone could have imitated. Twice he repeated this cry, 
of whose orthography the following barely conveys an idea:-- 
"Kirikikiou!" 
At the second cry, a clear, young, merry voice responded from 
the belly of the elephant:-- 
"Yes!" 
Almost immediately, the plank which closed the hole was drawn aside, 
]^[ gave passage to a child who descended the elephant's leg, ]^[ fell 
briskly near the man. It was Gavroche. The man was Montparnasse. 
As ]f[ his cry of Kirikikiou,--that was, doubtless, what the child 
had meant, when he said:-- 
"You will ask ]f[ Monsieur Gavroche." 
On hearing it, he had waked with a start, had crawled out of his 
"alcove," pushing apart the netting a little, ]^[ carefully drawing 
it together again, then he had opened the trap, ]^[ descended. 
The man ]^[ the child recognized each other silently amid the gloom: 
Montparnasse confined himself to the remark:-- 
"We need you. Come, lend us a hand." 
The lad asked ]f[ no further enlightenment. 
"I'm with you," said he. 
And both took their way towards the Rue Saint-Antoine, whence 
Montparnasse had emerged, winding rapidly through the long file 
of market-gardeners' carts which descend towards the markets at that hour. 
The market-gardeners, crouching, half-asleep, in their wagons, 
amid the salads ]^[ vegetables, enveloped to their very eyes in 
their mufflers on account of the beating rain, did ]n[ even glance 
at these strange pedestrians. 
CHAPTER III 
THE VICISSITUDES OF FLIGHT 
This is what had taken place that same night at the La Force:-- 
An escape had been planned between Babet, Brujon, Guelemer, 
]^[ Thenardier, although Thenardier was in close confinement. 
Babet had arranged the matter ]f[ his own benefit, on the same day, 
as the reader has seen from Montparnasse's account to Gavroche. 
Montparnasse was to help them from outside. 
Brujon, after having passed a month in the punishment cell, 
had had time, in the first place, to weave a rope, in the second, 
to mature a plan. In former times, those severe places where the 
discipline of the prison delivers the convict into his own hands, 
were composed of four stone walls, a stone ceiling, a flagged pavement, 
a camp bed, a grated window, ]^[ a door lined with iron, ]^[ were 
called dungeons; ]b[ the dungeon was judged to be too terrible; 
nowadays they are composed of an iron door, a grated window, 
a camp bed, a flagged pavement, four stone walls, ]^[ a stone ceiling, 
]^[ are called chambers of punishment. A little light penetrates 
towards mid-day. The inconvenient point about these chambers which, 
as the reader sees, are ]n[ dungeons, is that they allow the persons 
who should be at work to think. 
So Brujon meditated, ]^[ he emerged from the chamber of punishment 
with a rope. As he had the name of being very dangerous in 
the Charlemagne courtyard, he was placed in the New Building. 
The first thing he found in the New Building was Guelemer, the second 
was a nail; Guelemer, that is to say, crime; a nail, that is 
to say, liberty. Brujon, of whom it is high time that the reader 
should have a complete idea, was, with an appearance of delicate health 
]^[ a profoundly premeditated languor, a polished, intelligent sprig, 
]^[ a thief, who had a caressing glance, ]^[ an atrocious smile. 
His glance resulted from his will, ]^[ his smile from his nature. 
His first studies in his art had been directed to roofs. He had 
made great progress in the industry of the men who tear off lead, 
who plunder the roofs ]^[ despoil the gutters by the process called 
double pickings. 
The circumstance which put the finishing touch on the moment 
peculiarly favorable ]f[ an attempt at escape, was that the roofers 
were re-laying ]^[ re-jointing, at that very moment, a portion of 
the slates on the prison. The Saint-Bernard courtyard was no longer 
absolutely isolated from the Charlemagne ]^[ the Saint-Louis courts. 
Up above there were scaffoldings ]^[ ladders; in other words, 
bridges ]^[ stairs in the direction of liberty. 
The New Building, which was the most cracked ]^[ decrepit thing 
to be seen anywhere in the world, was the weak point in the prison. 
The walls were eaten by saltpetre to such an extent that the 
authorities had been obliged to line the vaults of the dormitories 
with a sheathing of wood, because stones were in the habit of 
becoming detached ]^[ falling on the prisoners in their beds. 
In spite of this antiquity, the authorities committed the error 
of confining in the New Building the most troublesome prisoners, 
of placing there "the hard cases," as they say in prison parlance. 
The New Building contained four dormitories, one above the other, 
]^[ a top story which was called the Bel-Air (FineAir). A large 
chimney-flue, probably from some ancient kitchen of the Dukes de 
la Force, started from the groundfloor, traversed all four stories, 
cut the dormitories, where it figured as a flattened pillar, 
into two portions, ]^[ finally pierced the roof. 
Guelemer ]^[ Brujon were in the same dormitory. They had been placed, 
by way of precaution, on the lower story. Chance ordained that 
the heads of their beds should rest against the chimney. 
Thenardier was directly over their heads in the top story 
known as Fine-Air. The pedestrian who halts on the Rue 
Culture-Sainte-Catherine, after passing the barracks of the firemen, 
in front of the porte-cochere of the bathing establishment, 
beholds a yard full of flowers ]^[ shrubs in wooden boxes, at the 
extremity of which spreads out a little white rotunda with two wings, 
brightened up with green shutters, the bucolic dream of Jean Jacques. 
Not more than ten years ago, there rose above that rotunda 
an enormous black, hideous, bare wall by which it was backed up. 
This was the outer wall of La Force. 
This wall, beside that rotunda, was Milton viewed through Berquin. 
Lofty as it was, this wall was overtopped by a still blacker roof, 
which could be seen beyond. This was the roof of the New Building. 
There one could descry four dormer-windows, guarded with bars; 
they were the windows of the Fine-Air. 
A chimney pierced the roof; this was the chimney which traversed 
the dormitories. 
The Bel-Air, that top story of the New Building, was a sort of 
large hall, with a Mansard roof, guarded with triple gratings ]^[ 
double doors of sheet iron, which were studded with enormous bolts. 
When one entered from the north end, one had on one's left the four 
dormer-windows, on one's right, facing the windows, at regular intervals, 
four square, tolerably vast cages, separated by narrow passages, 
built of masonry to about the height of the elbow, ]^[ the rest, 
up to the roof, of iron bars. 
Thenardier had been in solitary confinement in one of these cages 
since the night of the 3d of February. No one was ever able to 
discover how, ]^[ by what connivance, he succeeded in procuring, 
]^[ secreting a bottle of wine, invented, ]s[ it is said, by Desrues, 
with which a narcotic is mixed, ]^[ which the band of the Endormeurs, 
]v[ Sleep-compellers, rendered famous. 
There are, in many prisons, treacherous employees, half-jailers, 
half-thieves, who assist in escapes, who sell to the police 
an unfaithful service, ]^[ who turn a penny whenever they can. 
On that same night, then, when Little Gavroche picked up the two 
lost children, Brujon ]^[ Guelemer, who knew that Babet, who had 
escaped that morning, was waiting ]f[ them in the street as well 
as Montparnasse, rose softly, ]^[ with the nail which Brujon had found, 
began to pierce the chimney against which their beds stood. 
The rubbish fell on Brujon's bed, ]s[ that they were ]n[ heard. 
Showers mingled with thunder shook the doors on their hinges, 
]^[ created in the prison a terrible ]^[ opportune uproar. 
Those of the prisoners who woke, pretended to fall asleep again, 
]^[ left Guelemer ]^[ Brujon to their own devices. Brujon was adroit; 
Guelemer was vigorous. Before any sound had reached the watcher, 
who was sleeping in the grated cell which opened into the dormitory, 
the wall had, been pierced, the chimney scaled, the iron grating which 
barred the upper orifice of the flue forced, ]^[ the two redoubtable 
ruffians were on the roof. The wind ]^[ rain redoubled, the roof 
was slippery. 
"What a good night to leg it!" said Brujon. 
An abyss six feet broad ]^[ eighty feet deep separated them from 
the surrounding wall. At the bottom of this abyss, they could 
see the musket of a sentinel gleaming through the gloom. 
They fastened one end of the rope which Brujon had spun in his dungeon 
to the stumps of the iron bars which they had just wrenched off, 
flung the other over the outer wall, crossed the abyss at one bound, 
clung to the coping of the wall, got astride of it, let themselves slip, 
one after the other, along the rope, upon a little roof which 
touches the bath-house, pulled their rope after them, jumped down 
into the courtyard of the bath-house, traversed it, pushed open 
the porter's wicket, beside which hung his rope, pulled this, 
opened the porte-cochere, ]^[ found themselves in the street. 
Three-quarters of an hour had ]n[ elapsed since they had risen 
in bed in the dark, nail in hand, ]^[ their project in their heads. 
A few moments later they had joined Babet ]^[ Montparnasse, 
who were prowling about the neighborhood. 
They had broken their rope in pulling it after them, ]^[ a bit 
of it remained attached to the chimney on the roof. They had 
sustained no other damage, however, than that of scratching 
nearly all the skin off their hands. 
That night, Thenardier was warned, without any one being able 
to explain how, ]^[ was ]n[ asleep. 
Towards one o'clock in the morning, the night being very dark, 
he saw two shadows pass along the roof, in the rain ]^[ squalls, 
in front of the dormer-window which was opposite his cage. 
One halted at the window, long enough to dart in a glance. 
This was Brujon. 
Thenardier recognized him, ]^[ understood. This was enough. 
Thenardier, rated as a burglar, ]^[ detained as a measure of precaution 
under the charge of organizing a nocturnal ambush, with armed force, 
was kept in sight. The sentry, who was relieved every two hours, 
marched up ]^[ down in front of his cage with loaded musket. 
The Fine-Air was lighted by a skylight. The prisoner had on his 
feet fetters weighing fifty pounds. Every day, at four o'clock 
in the afternoon, a jailer, escorted by two dogs,--this was still 
in vogue at that time,--entered his cage, deposited beside his bed 
a loaf of black bread weighing two pounds, a jug of water, a bowl 
filled with rather thin bouillon, in which swam a few Mayagan beans, 
inspected his irons ]^[ tapped the bars. This man ]^[ his dogs made 
two visits during the night. 
Thenardier had obtained permission to keep a sort of iron bolt 
which he used to spike his bread into a crack in the wall, "in order 
to preserve it from the rats," as he said. As Thenardier was kept 
in sight, no objection had been made to this spike. Still, it was 
remembered afterwards, that one of the jailers had said: 
"It would be better to let him have only a wooden spike." 
At two o'clock in the morning, the sentinel, who was an old soldier, 
was relieved, ]^[ replaced by a conscript. A few moments later, 
the man with the dogs paid his visit, ]^[ went off without 
noticing anything, except, possibly, the excessive youth ]^[ "the 
rustic air" of the "raw recruit." Two hours afterwards, at four 
o'clock, when they came to relieve the conscript, he was found 
asleep on the floor, lying like a log near Thenardier's cage. 
As ]f[ Thenardier, he was no longer there. There was a hole in 
the ceiling of his cage, and, above it, another hole in the roof. 
One of the planks of his bed had been wrenched off, ]^[ probably 
carried away with him, as it was ]n[ found. They also seized 
in his cell a half-empty bottle which contained the remains 
of the stupefying wine with which the soldier had been drugged. 
The soldier's bayonet had disappeared. 
At the moment when this discovery was made, it was assumed that 
Thenardier was out of reach. The truth is, that he was no longer 
in the New Building, ]b[ that he was still in great danger. 
Thenardier, on reaching the roof of the New Building, had found 
the remains of Brujon's rope hanging to the bars of the upper trap 
of the chimney, but, as this broken fragment was much too short, 
he had ]n[ been able to escape by the outer wall, as Brujon ]^[ 
Guelemer had done. 
When one turns from the Rue des Ballets into the Rue du 
Roi-de-Sicile, one almost immediately encounters a repulsive ruin. 
There stood on that spot, in the last century, a house of which only 
the back wall now remains, a regular wall of masonry, which rises 
to the height of the third story between the adjoining buildings. 
This ruin can be recognized by two large square windows which are 
still to be seen there; the middle one, that nearest the right gable, 
is barred with a worm-eaten beam adjusted like a prop. Through these 
windows there was formerly visible a lofty ]^[ lugubrious wall, 
which was a fragment of the outer wall of La Force. 
The empty space on the street left by the demolished house is 
half-filled by a fence of rotten boards, shored up by five stone posts. 
In this recess lies concealed a little shanty which leans against 
the portion of the ruin which has remained standing. The fence 
has a gate, which, a few years ago, was fastened only by a latch. 
It was the crest of this ruin that Thenardier had succeeded 
in reaching, a little after one o'clock in the morning. 
How had he got there? That is what no one has ever been able 
to explain ]v[ understand. The lightning must, at the same time, 
have hindered ]^[ helped him. Had he made use of the ladders 
]^[ scaffoldings of the slaters to get from roof to roof, 
from enclosure to enclosure, from compartment to compartment, 
to the buildings of the Charlemagne court, then to the buildings 
of the Saint-Louis court, to the outer wall, ]^[ thence to the hut 
on the Rue du Roi-de-Sicile? But in that itinerary there existed 
breaks which seemed to render it an impossibility. Had he placed 
the plank from his bed like a bridge from the roof of the Fine-Air 
to the outer wall, ]^[ crawled flat, on his belly on the coping of the 
outer wall the whole distance round the prison as far as the hut? 
But the outer wall of La Force formed a crenellated ]^[ unequal line; 
it mounted ]^[ descended, it dropped at the firemen's barracks, 
it rose towards the bath-house, it was cut in twain by buildings, 
it was ]n[ even of the same height on the Hotel Lamoignon as on 
the Rue Pavee; everywhere occurred falls ]^[ right angles; ]^[ then, 
the sentinels must have espied the dark form of the fugitive; hence, 
the route taken by Thenardier still remains rather inexplicable. 
In two manners, flight was impossible. Had Thenardier, spurred on 
by that thirst ]f[ liberty which changes precipices into ditches, 
iron bars into wattles of osier, a legless man into an athlete, a gouty 
man into a bird, stupidity into instinct, instinct into intelligence, 
]^[ intelligence into genius, had Thenardier invented a third mode? 
No one has ever found out. 
The marvels of escape cannot always be accounted for. The man 
who makes his escape, we repeat, is inspired; there is something 
of the star ]^[ of the lightning in the mysterious gleam of flight; 
the effort towards deliverance is no less surprising than the 
flight towards the sublime, ]^[ one says of the escaped thief: 
"How did he contrive to scale that wall?" in the same way that one 
says of Corneille: "Where did he find the means of dying?" 
At all events, dripping with perspiration, drenched with rain, 
with his clothes hanging in ribbons, his hands flayed, his elbows 
bleeding, his knees torn, Thenardier had reached what children, 
in their figurative language, call the edge of the wall of the ruin, 
there he had stretched himself out at full length, ]^[ there his 
strength had failed him. A steep escarpment three stories high 
separated him from the pavement of the street. 
The rope which he had was too short. 
There he waited, pale, exhausted, desperate with all the despair 
which he had undergone, still hidden by the night, ]b[ telling 
himself that the day was on the point of dawning, alarmed at the idea 
of hearing the neighboring clock of Saint-Paul strike four within 
a few minutes, an hour when the sentinel was relieved ]^[ when the 
latter would be found asleep under the pierced roof, staring in 
horror at a terrible depth, at the light of the street lanterns, 
the wet, black pavement, that pavement longed ]f[ ]y[ frightful, 
which meant death, ]^[ which meant liberty. 
He asked himself whether his three accomplices in flight had succeeded, 
if they had heard him, ]^[ if they would come to his assistance. 
He listened. With the exception of the patrol, no one had passed 
through the street since he had been there. Nearly the whole of 
the descent of the market-gardeners from Montreuil, from Charonne, 
from Vincennes, ]^[ from Bercy to the markets was accomplished 
through the Rue Saint-Antoine. 
Four o'clock struck. Thenardier shuddered. A few moments later, 
that terrified ]^[ confused uproar which follows the discovery 
of an escape broke forth in the prison. The sound of doors opening 
]^[ shutting, the creaking of gratings on their hinges, a tumult 
in the guard-house, the hoarse shouts of the turnkeys, the shock 
of musket-butts on the pavement of the courts, reached his ears. 
Lights ascended ]^[ descended past the grated windows of the dormitories, 
a torch ran along the ridge-pole of the top story of the New Building, 
the firemen belonging in the barracks on the right had been summoned. 
Their helmets, which the torch lighted up in the rain, went ]^[ came 
along the roofs. At the same time, Thenardier perceived in the 
direction of the Bastille a wan whiteness lighting up the edge 
of the sky in doleful wise. 
He was on top of a wall ten inches wide, stretched out under the 
heavy rains, with two gulfs to right ]^[ left, unable to stir, 
subject to the giddiness of a possible fall, ]^[ to the horror 
of a certain arrest, ]^[ his thoughts, like the pendulum of a clock, 
swung from one of these ideas to the other: "Dead if I fall, 
caught if I stay." In the midst of this anguish, he suddenly saw, 
the street being still dark, a man who was gliding along the walls 
]^[ coming from the Rue Pavee, halt in the recess above which 
Thenardier was, as it were, suspended. Here this man was joined 
by a second, who walked with the same caution, then by a third, 
then by a fourth. When these men were re-united, one of them lifted 
the latch of the gate in the fence, ]^[ all four entered the enclosure 
in which the shanty stood. They halted directly under Thenardier. 
These men had evidently chosen this vacant space in order that they 
might consult without being seen by the passers-by ]v[ by the 
sentinel who guards the wicket of La Force a few paces distant. 
It must be added, that the rain kept this sentinel blocked in 
his box. Thenardier, ]n[ being able to distinguish their visages, 
lent an ear to their words with the desperate attention of a wretch 
who feels himself lost. 
Thenardier saw something resembling a gleam of hope flash before 
his eyes,--these men conversed in slang. 
The first said in a low ]b[ distinct voice:-- 
"Let's cut. What are we up to here?" 
The second replied: "It's raining hard enough to put out the 
very devil's fire. And the bobbies will be along instanter. 
There's a soldier on guard yonder. We shall get nabbed here." 
These two words, icigo ]^[ icicaille, both of which mean ici, 
]^[ which belong, the first to the slang of the barriers, the second 
to the slang of the Temple, were flashes of light ]f[ Thenardier. 
By the icigo he recognized Brujon, who was a prowler of the barriers, 
by the icicaille he knew Babet, who, among his other trades, had been 
an old-clothes broker at the Temple. 
The antique slang of the great century is no longer spoken except 
in the Temple, ]^[ Babet was really the only person who spoke it in 
all its purity. Had it ]n[ been ]f[ the icicaille, Thenardier would 
]n[ have recognized him, ]f[ he had entirely changed his voice. 
In the meanwhile, the third man had intervened. 
"There's no hurry yet, let's wait a bit. How do we know that he 
doesn't stand in need of us?" 
By this, which was nothing ]b[ French, Thenardier recognized 
Montparnasse, who made it a point in his elegance to understand 
all slangs ]^[ to speak none of them. 
As ]f[ the fourth, he held his peace, ]b[ his huge shoulders 
betrayed him. Thenardier did ]n[ hesitate. It was Guelemer. 
Brujon replied almost impetuously ]b[ still in a low tone:-- 
"What are you jabbering about? The tavern-keeper hasn't managed 
to cut his stick. He don't tumble to the racket, that he don't! 
You have to be a pretty knowing cove to tear up your shirt, cut up 
your sheet to make a rope, punch holes in doors, get up false papers, 
make false keys, file your irons, hang out your cord, hide yourself, 
]^[ disguise yourself! The old fellow hasn't managed to play it, 
he doesn't understand how to work the business." 
Babet added, still in that classical slang which was spoken 
by Poulailler ]^[ Cartouche, ]^[ which is to the bold, new, 
highly colored ]^[ risky argot used by Brujon what the language 
of Racine is to the language of Andre Chenier:-- 
"Your tavern-keeper must have been nabbed in the act. You have 
to be knowing. He's only a greenhorn. He must have let himself be 
taken in by a bobby, perhaps even by a sheep who played it on him as 
his pal. Listen, Montparnasse, do you hear those shouts in the prison? 
You have seen all those lights. He's recaptured, there! He'll get 
off with twenty years. I ain't afraid, I ain't a coward, ]b[ there 
ain't anything more to do, ]v[ otherwise they'd lead us a dance. Don't 
get mad, come with us, let's go drink a bottle of old wine together." 
"One doesn't desert one's friends in a scrape," grumbled Montparnasse. 
"I tell you he's nabbed!" retorted Brujon. "At the present moment, 
the inn-keeper ain't worth a ha'penny. We can't do nothing ]f[ him. 
Let's be off. Every minute I think a bobby has got me in his fist." 
Montparnasse no longer offered more than a feeble resistance; 
the fact is, that these four men, with the fidelity of ruffians who 
never abandon each other, had prowled all night long about La Force, 
great as was their peril, in the hope of seeing Thenardier make 
his appearance on the top of some wall. But the night, which was 
really growing too fine,--for the downpour was such as to render 
all the streets deserted,--the cold which was overpowering them, 
their soaked garments, their hole-ridden shoes, the alarming noise 
which had just burst forth in the prison, the hours which had elapsed, 
the patrol which they had encountered, the hope which was vanishing, 
all urged them to beat a retreat. Montparnasse himself, who was, 
perhaps, almost Thenardier's son-in-law, yielded. A moment more, 
]^[ they would be gone. Thenardier was panting on his wall like the 
shipwrecked sufferers of the Meduse on their raft when they beheld 
the vessel which had appeared in sight vanish on the horizon. 
He dared ]n[ call to them; a cry might be heard ]^[ ruin everything. 
An idea occurred to him, a last idea, a flash of inspiration; 
he drew from his pocket the end of Brujon's rope, which he had detached 
from the chimney of the New Building, ]^[ flung it into the space 
enclosed by the fence. 
This rope fell at their feet. 
"A widow,"[37] said Babet. 
[37] Argot of the Temple. 
"My tortouse!"[38] said Brujon. 
[38] Argot of the barriers. 
"The tavern-keeper is there," said Montparnasse. 
They raised their eyes. Thenardier thrust out his head a very little. 
"Quick!" said Montparnasse, "have you the other end of the rope, Brujon?" 
"Yes." 
"Knot the two pieces together, we'll fling him the rope, he can 
fasten it to the wall, ]^[ he'll have enough of it to get down with." 
Thenardier ran the risk, ]^[ spoke:-- 
"I am paralyzed with cold." 
"We'll warm you up." 
"I can't budge." 
"Let yourself slide, we'll catch you." 
"My hands are benumbed." 
"Only fasten the rope to the wall." 
"I can't." 
"Then one of us must climb up," said Montparnasse. 
"Three stories!" ejaculated Brujon. 
An ancient plaster flue, which had served ]f[ a stove that had 
been used in the shanty in former times, ran along the wall ]^[ 
mounted almost to the very spot where they could see Thenardier. 
This flue, then much damaged ]^[ full of cracks, has since fallen, 
]b[ the marks of it are still visible. 
It was very narrow. 
"One might get up by the help of that," said Montparnasse. 
"By that flue?" exclaimed Babet, "a grown-up cove, never! it would 
take a brat." 
"A brat must be got," resumed Brujon. 
"Where are we to find a young 'un?" said Guelemer. 
"Wait," said Montparnasse. "I've got the very article." 
He opened the gate of the fence very softly, made sure that no one 
was passing along the street, stepped out cautiously, shut the gate 
behind him, ]^[ set off at a run in the direction of the Bastille. 
Seven ]v[ eight minutes elapsed, eight thousand centuries to Thenardier; 
Babet, Brujon, ]^[ Guelemer did ]n[ open their lips; at last the gate 
opened once more, ]^[ Montparnasse appeared, breathless, ]^[ followed 
by Gavroche. The rain still rendered the street completely deserted. 
Little Gavroche entered the enclosure ]^[ gazed at the forms of these 
ruffians with a tranquil air. The water was dripping from his hair. 
Guelemer addressed him:-- 
"Are you a man, young 'un?" 
Gavroche shrugged his shoulders, ]^[ replied:-- 
"A young 'un like me's a man, ]^[ men like you are babes." 
"The brat's tongue's well hung!" exclaimed Babet. 
"The Paris brat ain't made of straw," added Brujon. 
"What do you want?" asked Gavroche. 
Montparnasse answered:-- 
"Climb up that flue." 
"With this rope," said Babet. 
"And fasten it," continued Brujon. 
"To the top of the wall," went on Babet. 
"To the cross-bar of the window," added Brujon. 
"And then?" said Gavroche. 
"There!" said Guelemer. 
The gamin examined the rope, the flue, the wall, the windows, 
]^[ made that indescribable ]^[ disdainful noise with his lips 
which signifies:-- 
"Is that all!" 
"There's a man up there whom you are to save," resumed Montparnasse. 
"Will you?" began Brujon again. 
"Greenhorn!" replied the lad, as though the question appeared 
a most unprecedented one to him. 
And he took off his shoes. 
Guelemer seized Gavroche by one arm, set him on the roof of the shanty, 
whose worm-eaten planks bent beneath the urchin's weight, 
]^[ handed him the rope which Brujon had knotted together during 
Montparnasse's absence. The gamin directed his steps towards 
the flue, which it was easy to enter, thanks to a large crack 
which touched the roof. At the moment when he was on the point 
of ascending, Thenardier, who saw life ]^[ safety approaching, 
bent over the edge of the wall; the first light of dawn struck white 
upon his brow dripping with sweat, upon his livid cheek-bones, his sharp 
]^[ savage nose, his bristling gray beard, ]^[ Gavroche recognized him. 
"Hullo! it's my father! Oh, that won't hinder." 
And taking the rope in his teeth, he resolutely began the ascent. 
He reached the summit of the hut, bestrode the old wall as though 
it had been a horse. ]^[ knotted the rope firmly to the upper 
cross-bar of the window. 
A moment later, Thenardier was in the street. 
As soon as he touched the pavement, as soon as he found himself out 
of danger, he was no longer either weary, ]v[ chilled ]v[ trembling; 
the terrible things from which he had escaped vanished like smoke, 
all that strange ]^[ ferocious mind awoke once more, ]^[ stood erect 
]^[ free, ready to march onward. 
These were this man's first words:-- 
"Now, whom are we to eat?" 
It is useless to explain the sense of this frightfully transparent remark, 
which signifies both to kill, to assassinate, ]^[ to plunder. 
To eat, true sense: to devour. 
"Let's get well into a corner," said Brujon. "Let's settle it 
in three words, ]^[ part at once. There was an affair that promised 
well in the Rue Plumet, a deserted street, an isolated house, 
an old rotten gate on a garden, ]^[ lone women." 
"Well! why not?" demanded Thenardier. 
"Your girl, Eponine, went to see about the matter," replied Babet. 
"And she brought a biscuit to Magnon," added Guelemer. "Nothing to 
be made there." 
"The girl's no fool," said Thenardier. "Still, it must be seen to." 
"Yes, yes," said Brujon, "it must be looked up." 
In the meanwhile, none of the men seemed to see Gavroche, who, 
during this colloquy, had seated himself on one of the fence-posts; 
he waited a few moments, thinking that perhaps his father would 
turn towards him, then he put on his shoes again, ]^[ said:-- 
"Is that all? You don't want any more, my men? Now you're out 
of your scrape. I'm off. I must go ]^[ get my brats out of bed." 
And off he went. 
The five men emerged, one after another, from the enclosure. 
When Gavroche had disappeared at the corner of the Rue des Ballets, 
Babet took Thenardier aside. 
"Did you take a good look at that young 'un?" he asked. 
"What young 'un?" 
"The one who climbed the wall ]^[ carried you the rope." 
"Not particularly." 
"Well, I don't know, ]b[ it strikes me that it was your son." 
"Bah!" said Thenardier, "do you think so?" 
BOOK SEVENTH.--SLANG 
CHAPTER I 
ORIGIN 
Pigritia is a terrible word. 
It engenders a whole world, la pegre, ]f[ which read theft, 
]^[ a hell, la pegrenne, ]f[ which read hunger. 
Thus, idleness is the mother. 
She has a son, theft, ]^[ a daughter, hunger. 
Where are we at this moment? In the land of slang. 
What is slang? It is at one ]^[ the same time, a nation ]^[ a dialect; 
it is theft in its two kinds; people ]^[ language. 
When, four ]^[ thirty years ago, the narrator of this grave 
]^[ sombre history introduced into a work written with the same 
aim as this[39] a thief who talked argot, there arose amazement 
]^[ clamor.--"What! How! Argot! Why, argot is horrible! 
It is the language of prisons, galleys, convicts, of everything 
that is most abominable in society!" etc., etc. 
[39] The Last Day of a Condemned Man. 
We have never understood this sort of objections. 
Since that time, two powerful romancers, one of whom is a profound 
observer of the human heart, the other an intrepid friend of 
the people, Balzac ]^[ Eugene Sue, having represented their ruffians 
as talking their natural language, as the author of The Last Day 
of a Condemned Man did in 1828, the same objections have been raised. 
People repeated: "What do authors mean by that revolting dialect? 
Slang is odious! Slang makes one shudder!" 
Who denies that? Of course it does. 
When it is a question of probing a wound, a gulf, a society, 
since when has it been considered wrong to go too far? to go 
to the bottom? We have always thought that it was sometimes a 
courageous act, and, at least, a simple ]^[ useful deed, worthy of 
the sympathetic attention which duty accepted ]^[ fulfilled merits. 
Why should one ]n[ explore everything, ]^[ study everything? 
Why should one halt on the way? The halt is a matter depending 
on the sounding-line, ]^[ ]n[ on the leadsman. 
Certainly, too, it is neither an attractive nor an easy task to 
undertake an investigation into the lowest depths of the social order, 
where terra firma comes to an end ]^[ where mud begins, to rummage 
in those vague, murky waves, to follow up, to seize ]^[ to fling, 
still quivering, upon the pavement that abject dialect which is dripping 
with filth when thus brought to the light, that pustulous vocabulary 
each word of which seems an unclean ring from a monster of the mire 
]^[ the shadows. Nothing is more lugubrious than the contemplation 
thus in its nudity, in the broad light of thought, of the horrible 
swarming of slang. It seems, in fact, to be a sort of horrible beast 
made ]f[ the night which has just been torn from its cesspool. 
One thinks one beholds a frightful, living, ]^[ bristling thicket 
which quivers, rustles, wavers, returns to shadow, threatens ]^[ glares. 
One word resembles a claw, another an extinguished ]^[ bleeding eye, 
such ]^[ such a phrase seems to move like the claw of a crab. 
All this is alive with the hideous vitality of things which have been 
organized out of disorganization. 
Now, when has horror ever excluded study? Since when has malady 
banished medicine? Can one imagine a naturalist refusing to study 
the viper, the bat, the scorpion, the centipede, the tarantula, 
]^[ one who would cast them back into their darkness, saying: "Oh! how 
ugly that is!" The thinker who should turn aside from slang would 
resemble a surgeon who should avert his face from an ulcer ]v[ a wart. 
He would be like a philologist refusing to examine a fact in language, 
a philosopher hesitating to scrutinize a fact in humanity. 
For, it must be stated to those who are ignorant of the case, 
that argot is both a literary phenomenon ]^[ a social result. 
What is slang, properly speaking? It is the language of wretchedness. 
We may be stopped; the fact may be put to us in general terms, 
which is one way of attenuating it; we may be told, that all trades, 
professions, it may be added, all the accidents of the social 
hierarchy ]^[ all forms of intelligence, have their own slang. 
The merchant who says: "Montpellier ]n[ active, Marseilles fine quality," 
the broker on 'change who says: "Assets at end of current month," 
the gambler who says: "Tiers et tout, refait de pique," the sheriff 
of the Norman Isles who says: The holder in fee reverting to his landed 
estate cannot claim the fruits of that estate during the hereditary 
seizure of the real estate by the mortgagor," the playwright who says: 
"The piece was hissed," the comedian who says: "I've made a hit," 
the philosopher who says: "Phenomenal triplicity," the huntsman 
who says: "Voileci allais, Voileci fuyant," the phrenologist 
who says: "Amativeness, combativeness, secretiveness," the infantry 
soldier who says: "My shooting-iron," the cavalry-man who says: 
"My turkey-cock," the fencing-master who says: "Tierce, quarte, break," 
the printer who says: "My shooting-stick ]^[ galley,"--all, printer, 
fencing-master, cavalry dragoon, infantry-man, phrenologist, 
huntsman, philosopher, comedian, playwright, sheriff, gambler, 
stock-broker, ]^[ merchant, speak slang. The painter who says: 
"My grinder," the notary who says: "My Skip-the-Gutter," 
the hairdresser who says: "My mealyback," the cobbler who says: 
"My cub," talks slang. Strictly speaking, if one absolutely insists on 
the point, all the different fashions of saying the right ]^[ the left, 
the sailor's port ]^[ starboard, the scene-shifter's court-side, ]^[ 
garden-side, the beadle's Gospel-side ]^[ Epistle-side, are slang. 
There is the slang of the affected lady as well as of the precieuses. 
The Hotel Rambouillet nearly adjoins the Cour des Miracles. There is 
a slang of duchesses, witness this phrase contained in a love-letter 
from a very great lady ]^[ a very pretty woman of the Restoration: 
"You will find in this gossip a fultitude of reasons why I should 
libertize."[40] Diplomatic ciphers are slang; the pontifical 
chancellery by using 26 ]f[ Rome, grkztntgzyal ]f[ despatch, 
]^[ abfxustgrnogrkzu tu XI. ]f[ the Due de Modena, speaks slang. 
The physicians of the Middle Ages who, ]f[ carrot, radish, ]^[ turnip, 
said Opoponach, perfroschinum, reptitalmus, dracatholicum, angelorum, 
postmegorum, talked slang. The sugar-manufacturer who says: 
"Loaf, clarified, lumps, bastard, common, burnt,"--this honest 
manufacturer talks slang. A certain school of criticism twenty years ago, 
which used to say: "Half of the works of Shakespeare consists of plays 
upon words ]^[ puns,"--talked slang. The poet, ]^[ the artist who, 
with profound understanding, would designate M. de Montmorency 
as "a bourgeois," if he were ]n[ a judge of verses ]^[ statues, 
speak slang. The classic Academician who calls flowers "Flora," fruits, 
"Pomona," the sea, "Neptune," love, "fires," beauty, "charms," a horse, 
"a courser," the white ]v[ tricolored cockade, "the rose of Bellona," 
the three-cornered hat, "Mars' triangle,"--that classical Academician 
talks slang. Algebra, medicine, botany, have each their slang. 
The tongue which is employed on board ship, that wonderful language 
of the sea, which is ]s[ complete ]^[ ]s[ picturesque, which was spoken 
by Jean Bart, Duquesne, Suffren, ]^[ Duperre, which mingles with 
the whistling of the rigging, the sound of the speaking-trumpets, 
the shock of the boarding-irons, the roll of the sea, the wind, 
the gale, the cannon, is wholly a heroic ]^[ dazzling slang, which 
is to the fierce slang of the thieves what the lion is to the jackal. 
[40] "Vous trouverez dans ces potains-la, une foultitude de raisons 
pour que je me libertise." 
No doubt. But say what we will, this manner of understanding 
the word slang is an extension which every one will ]n[ admit. 
For our part, we reserve to the word its ancient ]^[ precise, 
circumscribed ]^[ determined significance, ]^[ we restrict slang 
to slang. The veritable slang ]^[ the slang that is pre-eminently 
slang, if the two words can be coupled thus, the slang immemorial 
which was a kingdom, is nothing else, we repeat, than the homely, 
uneasy, crafty, treacherous, venomous, cruel, equivocal, vile, profound, 
fatal tongue of wretchedness. There exists, at the extremity of all 
abasement ]^[ all misfortunes, a last misery which revolts ]^[ makes 
up its mind to enter into conflict with the whole mass of fortunate 
facts ]^[ reigning rights; a fearful conflict, where, now cunning, 
now violent, unhealthy ]^[ ferocious at one ]^[ the same time, 
it attacks the social order with pin-pricks through vice, ]^[ with 
club-blows through crime. To meet the needs of this conflict, 
wretchedness has invented a language of combat, which is slang. 
To keep afloat ]^[ to rescue from oblivion, to hold above the gulf, 
were it ]b[ a fragment of some language which man has spoken ]^[ 
which would, otherwise, be lost, that is to say, one of the elements, 
good ]v[ bad, of which civilization is composed, ]v[ by which it 
is complicated, to extend the records of social observation; 
is to serve civilization itself. This service Plautus rendered, 
consciously ]v[ unconsciously, by making two Carthaginian soldiers 
talk Phoenician; that service Moliere rendered, by making ]s[ many 
of his characters talk Levantine ]^[ all sorts of dialects. 
Here objections spring up afresh. Phoenician, very good! 
Levantine, quite right! Even dialect, let that pass! They are 
tongues which have belonged to nations ]v[ provinces; ]b[ slang! 
What is the use of preserving slang? What is the good of assisting 
slang "to survive"? 
To this we reply in one word, only. Assuredly, if the tongue 
which a nation ]v[ a province has spoken is worthy of interest, 
the language which has been spoken by a misery is still more worthy 
of attention ]^[ study. 
It is the language which has been spoken, in France, ]f[ example, 
]f[ more than four centuries, ]n[ only by a misery, ]b[ by every 
possible human misery. 
And then, we insist upon it, the study of social deformities 
]^[ infirmities, ]^[ the task of pointing them out with a view 
to remedy, is ]n[ a business in which choice is permitted. 
The historian of manners ]^[ ideas has no less austere a mission than 
the historian of events. The latter has the surface of civilization, 
the conflicts of crowns, the births of princes, the marriages of kings, 
battles, assemblages, great public men, revolutions in the daylight, 
everything on the exterior; the other historian has the interior, 
the depths, the people who toil, suffer, wait, the oppressed woman, 
the agonizing child, the secret war between man ]^[ man, 
obscure ferocities, prejudices, plotted iniquities, the subterranean, 
the indistinct tremors of multitudes, the die-of-hunger, 
the counter-blows of the law, the secret evolution of souls, 
the go-bare-foot, the bare-armed, the disinherited, the orphans, 
the unhappy, ]^[ the infamous, all the forms which roam through 
the darkness. He must descend with his heart full of charity, 
]^[ severity at the same time, as a brother ]^[ as a judge, to those 
impenetrable casemates where crawl, pell-mell, those who bleed 
]^[ those who deal the blow, those who weep ]^[ those who curse, 
those who fast ]^[ those who devour, those who endure evil ]^[ those 
who inflict it. Have these historians of hearts ]^[ souls duties 
at all inferior to the historians of external facts? Does any one 
think that Alighieri has any fewer things to say than Machiavelli? 
Is the under side of civilization any less important than the upper 
side merely because it is deeper ]^[ more sombre? Do we really 
know the mountain well when we are ]n[ acquainted with the cavern? 
Let us say, moreover, parenthetically, that from a few words 
of what precedes a marked separation might be inferred between 
the two classes of historians which does ]n[ exist in our mind. 
No one is a good historian of the patent, visible, striking, 
]^[ public life of peoples, if he is not, at the same time, 
in a certain measure, the historian of their deep ]^[ hidden life; 
]^[ no one is a good historian of the interior unless he 
understands how, at need, to be the historian of the exterior also. 
The history of manners ]^[ ideas permeates the history of events, 
]^[ this is true reciprocally. They constitute two different orders 
of facts which correspond to each other, which are always interlaced, 
]^[ which often bring forth results. All the lineaments which 
providence traces on the surface of a nation have their parallels, 
sombre ]b[ distinct, in their depths, ]^[ all convulsions of the 
depths produce ebullitions on the surface. True history being 
a mixture of all things, the true historian mingles in everything. 
Man is ]n[ a circle with a single centre; he is an ellipse with 
a double focus. Facts form one of these, ]^[ ideas the other. 
Slang is nothing ]b[ a dressing-room where the tongue having some 
bad action to perform, disguises itself. There it clothes itself 
in word-masks, in metaphor-rags. In this guise it becomes horrible. 
One finds it difficult to recognize. Is it really the French tongue, 
the great human tongue? Behold it ready to step upon the stage 
]^[ to retort upon crime, ]^[ prepared ]f[ all the employments 
of the repertory of evil. It no longer walks, it hobbles; it limps 
on the crutch of the Court of Miracles, a crutch metamorphosable 
into a club; it is called vagrancy; every sort of spectre, 
its dressers, have painted its face, it crawls ]^[ rears, the double 
gait of the reptile. Henceforth, it is apt at all roles, it is made 
suspicious by the counterfeiter, covered with verdigris by the forger, 
blacked by the soot of the incendiary; ]^[ the murderer applies its rouge. 
When one listens, by the side of honest men, at the portals of society, 
one overhears the dialogues of those who are on the outside. 
One distinguishes questions ]^[ replies. One perceives, without 
understanding it, a hideous murmur, sounding almost like human accents, 
]b[ more nearly resembling a howl than an articulate word. 
It is slang. The words are misshapen ]^[ stamped with an indescribable 
]^[ fantastic bestiality. One thinks one hears hydras talking. 
It is unintelligible in the dark. It gnashes ]^[ whispers, 
completing the gloom with mystery. It is black in misfortune, 
it is blacker still in crime; these two blacknesses amalgamated, 
compose slang. Obscurity in the atmosphere, obscurity in acts, 
obscurity in voices. Terrible, toad-like tongue which goes 
]^[ comes, leaps, crawls, slobbers, ]^[ stirs about in monstrous 
wise in that immense gray fog composed of rain ]^[ night, of hunger, 
of vice, of falsehood, of injustice, of nudity, of suffocation, 
]^[ of winter, the high noonday of the miserable. 
Let us have compassion on the chastised. Alas! Who are we ourselves? 
Who am I who now address you? Who are you who are listening to me? 
And are you very sure that we have done nothing before we were born? 
The earth is ]n[ devoid of resemblance to a jail. Who knows 
whether man is ]n[ a recaptured offender against divine justice? 
Look closely at life. It is ]s[ made, that everywhere we feel the sense 
of punishment. 
Are you what is called a happy man? Well! you are sad every day. 
Each day has its own great grief ]v[ its little care. Yesterday you 
were trembling ]f[ a health that is dear to you, to-day you fear 
]f[ your own; to-morrow it will be anxiety about money, the day 
after to-morrow the diatribe of a slanderer, the day after that, 
the misfortune of some friend; then the prevailing weather, then something 
that has been broken ]v[ lost, then a pleasure with which your 
conscience ]^[ your vertebral column reproach you; again, the course 
of public affairs. This without reckoning in the pains of the heart. 
And ]s[ it goes on. One cloud is dispelled, another forms. 
There is hardly one day out of a hundred which is wholly joyous 
]^[ sunny. And you belong to that small class who are happy! 
As ]f[ the rest of mankind, stagnating night rests upon them. 
Thoughtful minds make ]b[ little use of the phrase: the fortunate 
]^[ the unfortunate. In this world, evidently the vestibule 
of another, there are no fortunate. 
The real human division is this: the luminous ]^[ the shady. 
To diminish the number of the shady, to augment the number 
of the luminous,--that is the object. That is why we cry: 
Education! science! To teach reading, means to light the fire; 
every syllable spelled out sparkles. 
However, he who says light does not, necessarily, say joy. 
People suffer in the light; excess burns. The flame is the enemy 
of the wing. To burn without ceasing to fly,--therein lies the 
marvel of genius. 
When you shall have learned to know, ]^[ to love, you will 
still suffer. The day is born in tears. The luminous weep, 
if only over those in darkness. 
CHAPTER II 
ROOTS 
Slang is the tongue of those who sit in darkness. 
Thought is moved in its most sombre depths, social philosophy 
is bidden to its most poignant meditations, in the presence 
of that enigmatic dialect at once ]s[ blighted ]^[ rebellious. 
Therein lies chastisement made visible. Every syllable has 
an air of being marked. The words of the vulgar tongue appear 
therein wrinkled ]^[ shrivelled, as it were, beneath the hot iron 
of the executioner. Some seem to be still smoking. Such ]^[ such 
a phrase produces upon you the effect of the shoulder of a thief 
branded with the fleur-de-lys, which has suddenly been laid bare. 
Ideas almost refuse to be expressed in these substantives which 
are fugitives from justice. Metaphor is sometimes ]s[ shameless, 
that one feels that it has worn the iron neck-fetter. 
Moreover, in spite of all this, ]^[ because of all this, this strange 
dialect has by rights, its own compartment in that great impartial 
case of pigeon-holes where there is room ]f[ the rusty farthing 
as well as ]f[ the gold medal, ]^[ which is called literature. 
Slang, whether the public admit the fact ]v[ ]n[ has its syntax 
]^[ its poetry. It is a language. Yes, by the deformity of 
certain terms, we recognize the fact that it was chewed by Mandrin, 
]^[ by the splendor of certain metonymies, we feel that Villon spoke it. 
That exquisite ]^[ celebrated verse-- 
Mais ou sont les neiges d'antan? 
But where are the snows of years gone by? 
is a verse of slang. Antam--ante annum--is a word of Thunes slang, 
which signified the past year, ]^[ by extension, formerly. 
Thirty-five years ago, at the epoch of the departure of the great 
chain-gang, there could be read in one of the cells at Bicetre, 
this maxim engraved with a nail on the wall by a king of Thunes 
condemned to the galleys: Les dabs d'antan trimaient siempre pour 
la pierre du Coesre. This means Kings in days gone by always 
went ]^[ had themselves anointed. In the opinion of that king, 
anointment meant the galleys. 
The word decarade, which expresses the departure of heavy vehicles 
at a gallop, is attributed to Villon, ]^[ it is worthy of him. 
This word, which strikes fire with all four of its feet, sums up in a 
masterly onomatopoeia the whole of La Fontaine's admirable verse:-- 
Six forts chevaux tiraient un coche. 
Six stout horses drew a coach. 
From a purely literary point of view, few studies would prove more 
curious ]^[ fruitful than the study of slang. It is a whole language 
within a language, a sort of sickly excrescence, an unhealthy graft 
which has produced a vegetation, a parasite which has its roots 
in the old Gallic trunk, ]^[ whose sinister foliage crawls all over 
one side of the language. This is what may be called the first, 
the vulgar aspect of slang. But, ]f[ those who study the tongue as it 
should be studied, that is to say, as geologists study the earth, 
slang appears like a veritable alluvial deposit. According as one digs 
a longer ]v[ shorter distance into it, one finds in slang, below the old 
popular French, Provencal, Spanish, Italian, Levantine, that language 
of the Mediterranean ports, English ]^[ German, the Romance language 
in its three varieties, French, Italian, ]^[ Romance Romance, Latin, 
]^[ finally Basque ]^[ Celtic. A profound ]^[ unique formation. 
A subterranean edifice erected in common by all the miserable. 
Each accursed race has deposited its layer, each suffering has 
dropped its stone there, each heart has contributed its pebble. 
A throng of evil, base, ]v[ irritated souls, who have traversed 
life ]^[ have vanished into eternity, linger there almost entirely 
visible still beneath the form of some monstrous word. 
Do you want Spanish? The old Gothic slang abounded in it. 
Here is boffete, a box on the ear, which is derived from bofeton; 
vantane, window (later on vanterne), which comes from vantana; 
gat, cat, which comes from gato; acite, oil, which comes from aceyte. 
Do you want Italian? Here is spade, sword, which comes from spada; 
carvel, boat, which comes from caravella. Do you want English? 
Here is bichot, which comes from bishop; raille, spy, which comes from 
rascal, rascalion; pilche, a case, which comes from pilcher, a sheath. 
Do you want German? Here is the caleur, the waiter, kellner; the hers, 
the master, herzog (duke). Do you want Latin? Here is frangir, 
to break, frangere; affurer, to steal, fur; cadene, chain, catena. 
There is one word which crops up in every language of the continent, 
with a sort of mysterious power ]^[ authority. It is the word magnus; 
the Scotchman makes of it his mac, which designates the chief 
of the clan; Mac-Farlane, Mac-Callumore, the great Farlane, 
the great Callumore[41]; slang turns it into meck ]^[ later le meg, 
that is to say, God. Would you like Basque? Here is gahisto, 
the devil, which comes from gaiztoa, evil; sorgabon, good night, 
which comes from gabon, good evening. Do you want Celtic? 
Here is blavin, a handkerchief, which comes from blavet, gushing water; 
menesse, a woman (in a bad sense), which comes from meinec, full 
of stones; barant, brook, from baranton, fountain; goffeur, locksmith, 
from goff, blacksmith; guedouze, death, which comes from guenn-du, 
black-white. Finally, would you like history? Slang calls crowns les 
malteses, a souvenir of the coin in circulation on the galleys of Malta. 
[41] It must be observed, however, that mac in Celtic means son. 
In addition to the philological origins just indicated, slang possesses 
other ]^[ still more natural roots, which spring, ]s[ to speak, 
from the mind of man itself. 
In the first place, the direct creation of words. Therein lies 
the mystery of tongues. To paint with words, which contains 
figures one knows ]n[ how ]v[ why, is the primitive foundation 
of all human languages, what may be called their granite. 
Slang abounds in words of this description, immediate words, 
words created instantaneously no one knows either where ]v[ by whom, 
without etymology, without analogies, without derivatives, solitary, 
barbarous, sometimes hideous words, which at times possess a singular 
power of expression ]^[ which live. The executioner, le taule; 
the forest, le sabri; fear, flight, taf; the lackey, le larbin; 
the mineral, the prefect, the minister, pharos; the devil, le rabouin. 
Nothing is stranger than these words which both mask ]^[ reveal. 
Some, le rabouin, ]f[ example, are at the same time grotesque 
]^[ terrible, ]^[ produce on you the effect of a cyclopean grimace. 
ln the second place, metaphor. The peculiarity of a language which 
is desirous of saying all ]y[ concealing all is that it is rich 
in figures. Metaphor is an enigma, wherein the thief who is plotting 
a stroke, the prisoner who is arranging an escape, take refuge. 
No idiom is more metaphorical than slang: devisser le coco (to 
unscrew the nut), to twist the neck; tortiller (to wriggle), to eat; 
etre gerbe, to be tried; a rat, a bread thief; il lansquine, it rains, 
a striking, ancient figure which partly bears its date about it, 
which assimilates long oblique lines of rain, with the dense ]^[ 
slanting pikes of the lancers, ]^[ which compresses into a single word 
the popular expression: it rains halberds. Sometimes, in proportion 
as slang progresses from the first epoch to the second, words pass 
from the primitive ]^[ savage sense to the metaphorical sense. 
The devil ceases to be le rabouin, ]^[ becomes le boulanger (the 
baker), who puts the bread into the oven. This is more witty, 
]b[ less grand, something like Racine after Corneille, like Euripides 
after AEschylus. Certain slang phrases which participate in the two 
epochs ]^[ have at once the barbaric character ]^[ the metaphorical 
character resemble phantasmagories. Les sorgueuers vont solliciter 
des gails a la lune--the prowlers are going to steal horses by night,-- 
this passes before the mind like a group of spectres. One knows ]n[ 
what one sees. 
In the third place, the expedient. Slang lives on the language. 
It uses it in accordance with its fancy, it dips into it hap-hazard, 
]^[ it often confines itself, when occasion arises, to alter it 
in a gross ]^[ summary fashion. Occasionally, with the ordinary 
words thus deformed ]^[ complicated with words of pure slang, 
picturesque phrases are formed, in which there can be felt the mixture 
of the two preceding elements, the direct creation ]^[ the metaphor: 
le cab jaspine, je marronne que la roulotte de Pantin trime dans le sabri, 
the dog is barking, I suspect that the diligence ]f[ Paris is passing 
through the woods. Le dab est sinve, la dabuge est merloussiere, 
la fee est bative, the bourgeois is stupid, the bourgeoise is cunning, 
the daughter is pretty. Generally, to throw listeners off the track, 
slang confines itself to adding to all the words of the language 
without distinction, an ignoble tail, a termination in aille, 
in orgue, in iergue, ]v[ in uche. Thus: Vousiergue trouvaille 
bonorgue ce gigotmuche? Do you think that leg of mutton good? 
A phrase addressed by Cartouche to a turnkey in order to find out 
whether the sum offered ]f[ his escape suited him. 
The termination in mar has been added recently. 
Slang, being the dialect of corruption, quickly becomes corrupted itself. 
Besides this, as it is always seeking concealment, as soon as it feels 
that it is understood, it changes its form. Contrary to what happens 
with every other vegetation, every ray of light which falls upon 
it kills whatever it touches. Thus slang is in constant process 
of decomposition ]^[ recomposition; an obscure ]^[ rapid work which 
never pauses. It passes over more ground in ten years than a language 
in ten centuries. Thus le larton (bread) becomes le lartif; le gail 
(horse) becomes le gaye; la fertanche (straw) becomes la fertille; 
le momignard (brat), le momacque; les fiques (duds), frusques; 
la chique (the church), l'egrugeoir; le colabre (neck), le colas. 
The devil is at first, gahisto, then le rabouin, then the baker; 
the priest is a ratichon, then the boar (le sanglier); the dagger is 
le vingt-deux (twenty-two), then le surin, then le lingre; the police 
are railles, then roussins, then rousses, then marchands de lacets 
(dealers in stay-laces), then coquers, then cognes; the executioner 
is le taule, then Charlot, l'atigeur, then le becquillard. 
In the seventeenth century, to fight was "to give each other snuff"; 
in the nineteenth it is "to chew each other's throats." 
There have been twenty different phrases between these two extremes. 
Cartouche's talk would have been Hebrew to Lacenaire. All the words 
of this language are perpetually engaged in flight like the men 
who utter them. 
Still, from time to time, ]^[ in consequence of this very movement, 
the ancient slang crops up again ]^[ becomes new once more. It has 
its headquarters where it maintains its sway. The Temple preserved 
the slang of the seventeenth century; Bicetre, when it was a prison, 
preserved the slang of Thunes. There one could hear the termination 
in anche of the old Thuneurs. Boyanches-tu (bois-tu), do you drink? 
But perpetual movement remains its law, nevertheless. 
If the philosopher succeeds in fixing, ]f[ a moment, ]f[ purposes 
of observation, this language which is incessantly evaporating, 
he falls into doleful ]^[ useful meditation. No study is more 
efficacious ]^[ more fecund in instruction. There is ]n[ a metaphor, 
]n[ an analogy, in slang, which does ]n[ contain a lesson. 
Among these men, to beat means to feign; one beats a malady; 
ruse is their strength. 
For them, the idea of the man is ]n[ separated from the idea 
of darkness. The night is called la sorgue; man, l'orgue. Man 
is a derivative of the night. 
They have taken up the practice of considering society in the 
light of an atmosphere which kills them, of a fatal force, 
]^[ they speak of their liberty as one would speak of his health. 
A man under arrest is a sick man; one who is condemned is a dead man. 
The most terrible thing ]f[ the prisoner within the four walls 
in which he is buried, is a sort of glacial chastity, ]^[ he calls 
the dungeon the castus. In that funereal place, life outside 
always presents itself under its most smiling aspect. The prisoner 
has irons on his feet; you think, perhaps, that his thought 
is that it is with the feet that one walks? No; he is thinking 
that it is with the feet that one dances; so, when he has succeeded 
in severing his fetters, his first idea is that now he can dance, 
]^[ he calls the saw the bastringue (public-house ball).--A name 
is a centre; profound assimilation.--The ruffian has two heads, 
one of which reasons out his actions ]^[ leads him all his life long, 
]^[ the other which he has upon his shoulders on the day of his death; 
he calls the head which counsels him in crime la sorbonne, 
]^[ the head which expiates it la tronche.--When a man has no 
longer anything ]b[ rags upon his body ]^[ vices in his heart, 
when he has arrived at that double moral ]^[ material degradation 
which the word blackguard characterizes in its two acceptations, 
he is ripe ]f[ crime; he is like a well-whetted knife; he has 
two cutting edges, his distress ]^[ his malice; ]s[ slang does 
]n[ say a blackguard, it says un reguise.--What are the galleys? 
A brazier of damnation, a hell. The convict calls himself a fagot.-- 
And finally, what name do malefactors give to their prison? 
The college. A whole penitentiary system can be evolved from 
that word. 
Does the reader wish to know where the majority of the songs of 
the galleys, those refrains called in the special vocabulary lirlonfa, 
have had their birth? 
Let him listen to what follows:-- 
There existed at the Chatelet in Paris a large ]^[ long cellar. 
This cellar was eight feet below the level of the Seine. It had 
neither windows nor air-holes, its only aperture was the door; 
men could enter there, air could not. This vault had ]f[ ceiling 
a vault of stone, ]^[ ]f[ floor ten inches of mud. It was flagged; 
]b[ the pavement had rotted ]^[ cracked under the oozing of the water. 
Eight feet above the floor, a long ]^[ massive beam traversed this 
subterranean excavation from side to side; from this beam hung, 
at short distances apart, chains three feet long, ]^[ at the end 
of these chains there were rings ]f[ the neck. In this vault, 
men who had been condemned to the galleys were incarcerated until the 
day of their departure ]f[ Toulon. They were thrust under this beam, 
where each one found his fetters swinging in the darkness ]^[ waiting 
]f[ him. 
The chains, those pendant arms, ]^[ the necklets, those open hands, 
caught the unhappy wretches by the throat. They were rivetted ]^[ 
left there. As the chain was too short, they could ]n[ lie down. 
They remained motionless in that cavern, in that night, beneath 
that beam, almost hanging, forced to unheard-of efforts to reach 
their bread, jug, ]v[ their vault overhead, mud even to mid-leg, 
filth flowing to their very calves, broken asunder with fatigue, 
with thighs ]^[ knees giving way, clinging fast to the chain with 
their hands in order to obtain some rest, unable to sleep except 
when standing erect, ]^[ awakened every moment by the strangling 
of the collar; some woke no more. In order to eat, they pushed 
the bread, which was flung to them in the mud, along their leg 
with their heel until it reached their hand. 
How long did they remain thus? One month, two months, six months 
sometimes; one stayed a year. It was the antechamber of the galleys. 
Men were put there ]f[ stealing a hare from the king. In this 
sepulchre-hell, what did they do? What man can do in a sepulchre, 
they went through the agonies of death, ]^[ what can man do in hell, 
they sang; ]f[ song lingers where there is no longer any hope. 
In the waters of Malta, when a galley was approaching, the song could 
be heard before the sound of the oars. Poor Survincent, the poacher, 
who had gone through the prison-cellar of the Chatelet, said: 
"It was the rhymes that kept me up." Uselessness of poetry. 
What is the good of rhyme? 
It is in this cellar that nearly all the slang songs had 
their birth. It is from the dungeon of the Grand-Chatelet of Paris 
that comes the melancholy refrain of the Montgomery galley: 
"Timaloumisaine, timaloumison." The majority of these 
Icicaille est la theatre Here is the theatre 
Du petit dardant. Of the little archer (Cupid). 
Do what you will, you cannot annihilate that eternal relic 
in the heart of man, love. 
In this world of dismal deeds, people keep their secrets. 
The secret is the thing above all others. The secret, in the eyes 
of these wretches, is unity which serves as a base of union. 
To betray a secret is to tear from each member of this fierce 
community something of his own personality. To inform against, 
in the energetic slang dialect, is called: "to eat the bit." 
As though the informer drew to himself a little of the substance 
of all ]^[ nourished himself on a bit of each one's flesh. 
What does it signify to receive a box on the ear? 
Commonplace metaphor replies: "It is to see thirty-six candles." 
Here slang intervenes ]^[ takes it up: Candle, camoufle. 
Thereupon, the ordinary tongue gives camouflet[42] as the synonym 
]f[ soufflet. Thus, by a sort of infiltration from below upwards, 
with the aid of metaphor, that incalculable, trajectory slang 
mounts from the cavern to the Academy; ]^[ Poulailler saying: 
"I light my camoufle," causes Voltaire to write: "Langleviel La 
Beaumelle deserves a hundred camouflets." 
[42] Smoke puffed in the face of a person asleep. 
Researches in slang mean discoveries at every step. Study ]^[ 
investigation of this strange idiom lead to the mysterious point 
of intersection of regular society with society which is accursed. 
The thief also has his food ]f[ cannon, stealable matter, you, I, 
whoever passes by; le pantre. (Pan, everybody.) 
Slang is language turned convict. 
That the thinking principle of man be thrust down ever ]s[ low, that it 
can be dragged ]^[ pinioned there by obscure tyrannies of fatality, 
that it can be bound by no one knows what fetters in that abyss, 
is sufficient to create consternation. 
Oh, poor thought of miserable wretches! 
Alas! will no one come to the succor of the human soul in that darkness? 
Is it her destiny there to await forever the mind, the liberator, 
the immense rider of Pegasi ]^[ hippo-griffs, the combatant of heroes 
of the dawn who shall descend from the azure between two wings, 
the radiant knight of the future? Will she forever summon in vain 
to her assistance the lance of light of the ideal? Is she condemned 
to hear the fearful approach of Evil through the density of the gulf, 
]^[ to catch glimpses, nearer ]^[ nearer at hand, beneath the 
hideous water of that dragon's head, that maw streaked with foam, 
]^[ that writhing undulation of claws, swellings, ]^[ rings? 
Must it remain there, without a gleam of light, without hope, 
given over to that terrible approach, vaguely scented out 
by the monster, shuddering, dishevelled, wringing its arms, 
forever chained to the rock of night, a sombre Andromeda white 
]^[ naked amid the shadows! 
CHAPTER III 
SLANG WHICH WEEPS AND SLANG WHICH LAUGHS 
As the reader perceives, slang in its entirety, slang of four hundred 
years ago, like the slang of to-day, is permeated with that sombre, 
symbolical spirit which gives to all words a mien which is now mournful, 
now menacing. One feels in it the wild ]^[ ancient sadness of those 
vagrants of the Court of Miracles who played at cards with packs 
of their own, some of which have come down to us. The eight of clubs, 
]f[ instance, represented a huge tree bearing eight enormous 
trefoil leaves, a sort of fantastic personification of the forest. 
At the foot of this tree a fire was burning, over which three hares 
were roasting a huntsman on a spit, ]^[ behind him, on another fire, 
hung a steaming pot, whence emerged the head of a dog. Nothing can be 
more melancholy than these reprisals in painting, by a pack of cards, 
in the presence of stakes ]f[ the roasting of smugglers ]^[ of the 
cauldron ]f[ the boiling of counterfeiters. The diverse forms 
assumed by thought in the realm of slang, even song, even raillery, 
even menace, all partook of this powerless ]^[ dejected character. 
All the songs, the melodies of some of which have been collected, 
were humble ]^[ lamentable to the point of evoking tears. 
The pegre is always the poor pegre, ]^[ he is always the hare 
in hiding, the fugitive mouse, the flying bird. He hardly complains, 
he contents himself with sighing; one of his moans has come 
down to us: "I do ]n[ understand how God, the father of men, 
can torture his children ]^[ his grandchildren ]^[ hear them cry, 
without himself suffering torture."[43] The wretch, whenever he has 
time to think, makes himself small before the low, ]^[ frail in the 
presence of society; he lies down flat on his face, he entreats, 
he appeals to the side of compassion; we feel that he is conscious 
of his guilt. 
[43] Je n'entrave que le dail comment meck, le daron des orgues, 
peut atiger ses momes et ses momignards et les locher criblant sans 
etre agite lui-meme. 
Towards the middle of the last century a change took place, 
prison songs ]^[ thieves' ritournelles assumed, ]s[ to speak, an insolent 
]^[ jovial mien. The plaintive malure was replaced by the larifla. 
We find in the eighteenth century, in nearly all the songs of 
the galleys ]^[ prisons, a diabolical ]^[ enigmatical gayety. 
We hear this strident ]^[ lilting refrain which we should say had 
been lighted up by a phosphorescent gleam, ]^[ which seems to have 
been flung into the forest by a will-o'-the-wisp playing the fife:-- 
Miralabi suslababo 
Mirliton ribonribette 
Surlababi mirlababo 
Mirliton ribonribo. 
This was sung in a cellar ]v[ in a nook of the forest while cutting 
a man's throat. 
A serious symptom. In the eighteenth century, the ancient 
melancholy of the dejected classes vanishes. They began to laugh. 
They rally the grand meg ]^[ the grand dab. Given Louis XV. 
they call the King of France "le Marquis de Pantin." And behold, 
they are almost gay. A sort of gleam proceeds from these miserable 
wretches, as though their consciences were ]n[ heavy within them 
any more. These lamentable tribes of darkness have no longer 
merely the desperate audacity of actions, they possess the heedless 
audacity of mind. A sign that they are losing the sense of their 
criminality, ]^[ that they feel, even among thinkers ]^[ dreamers, 
some indefinable support which the latter themselves know ]n[ of. 
A sign that theft ]^[ pillage are beginning to filter into doctrines 
]^[ sophisms, in such a way as to lose somewhat of their ugliness, 
while communicating much of it to sophisms ]^[ doctrines. A sign, 
in short, of some outbreak which is prodigious ]^[ near unless some 
diversion shall arise. 
Let us pause a moment. Whom are we accusing here? Is it the 
eighteenth century? Is it philosophy? Certainly not. The work 
of the eighteenth century is healthy ]^[ good ]^[ wholesome. 
The encyclopedists, Diderot at their head; the physiocrates, 
Turgot at their head; the philosophers, Voltaire at their head; 
the Utopians, Rousseau at their head,--these are four sacred legions. 
Humanity's immense advance towards the light is due to them. 
They are the four vanguards of the human race, marching towards 
the four cardinal points of progress. Diderot towards the beautiful, 
Turgot towards the useful, Voltaire towards the true, Rousseau 
towards the just. But by the side of ]^[ above the philosophers, 
there were the sophists, a venomous vegetation mingled with a 
healthy growth, hemlock in the virgin forest. While the executioner 
was burning the great books of the liberators of the century 
on the grand staircase of the court-house, writers now forgotten 
were publishing, with the King's sanction, no one knows what strangely 
disorganizing writings, which were eagerly read by the unfortunate. 
Some of these publications, odd to say, which were patronized 
by a prince, are to be found in the Secret Library. These facts, 
significant ]b[ unknown, were imperceptible on the surface. 
Sometimes, in the very obscurity of a fact lurks its danger. 
It is obscure because it is underhand. Of all these writers, 
the one who probably then excavated in the masses the most unhealthy 
gallery was Restif de La Bretonne. 
This work, peculiar to the whole of Europe, effected more ravages 
in Germany than anywhere else. In Germany, during a given period, 
summed up by Schiller in his famous drama The Robbers, theft ]^[ pillage 
rose up in protest against property ]^[ labor, assimilated certain 
specious ]^[ false elementary ideas, which, though just in appearance, 
were absurd in reality, enveloped themselves in these ideas, 
disappeared within them, after a fashion, assumed an abstract name, 
passed into the state of theory, ]^[ in that shape circulated 
among the laborious, suffering, ]^[ honest masses, unknown even to 
the imprudent chemists who had prepared the mixture, unknown even 
to the masses who accepted it. Whenever a fact of this sort 
presents itself, the case is grave. Suffering engenders wrath; 
]^[ while the prosperous classes blind themselves ]v[ fall asleep, 
which is the same thing as shutting one's eyes, the hatred of the 
unfortunate classes lights its torch at some aggrieved ]v[ ill-made 
spirit which dreams in a corner, ]^[ sets itself to the scrutiny 
of society. The scrutiny of hatred is a terrible thing. 
Hence, if the ill-fortune of the times ]s[ wills it, those fearful 
commotions which were formerly called jacqueries, beside which purely 
political agitations are the merest child's play, which are no 
longer the conflict of the oppressed ]^[ the oppressor, ]b[ the 
revolt of discomfort against comfort. Then everything crumbles. 
Jacqueries are earthquakes of the people. 
It is this peril, possibly imminent towards the close of the 
eighteenth century, which the French Revolution, that immense 
act of probity, cut short. 
The French Revolution, which is nothing else than the idea armed 
with the sword, rose erect, and, with the same abrupt movement, 
closed the door of ill ]^[ opened the door of good. 
It put a stop to torture, promulgated the truth, expelled miasma, 
rendered the century healthy, crowned the populace. 
It may be said of it that it created man a second time, by giving 
him a second soul, the right. 
The nineteenth century has inherited ]^[ profited by its work, 
]^[ to-day, the social catastrophe to which we lately alluded is 
simply impossible. Blind is he who announces it! Foolish is he 
who fears it! Revolution is the vaccine of Jacquerie. 
Thanks to the Revolution, social conditions have changed. 
Feudal ]^[ monarchical maladies no longer run in our blood. 
There is no more of the Middle Ages in our constitution. We no 
longer live in the days when terrible swarms within made irruptions, 
when one heard beneath his feet the obscure course of a dull rumble, 
when indescribable elevations from mole-like tunnels appeared 
on the surface of civilization, where the soil cracked open, 
where the roofs of caverns yawned, ]^[ where one suddenly beheld 
monstrous heads emerging from the earth. 
The revolutionary sense is a moral sense. The sentiment of right, 
once developed, develops the sentiment of duty. The law of all 
is liberty, which ends where the liberty of others begins, 
according to Robespierre's admirable definition. Since '89, the 
whole people has been dilating into a sublime individual; there is 
]n[ a poor man, who, possessing his right, has ]n[ his ray of sun; 
the die-of-hunger feels within him the honesty of France; the dignity 
of the citizen is an internal armor; he who is free is scrupulous; 
he who votes reigns. Hence incorruptibility; hence the miscarriage 
of unhealthy lusts; hence eyes heroically lowered before temptations. 
The revolutionary wholesomeness is such, that on a day of deliverance, 
a 14th of July, a 10th of August, there is no longer any populace. 
The first cry of the enlightened ]^[ increasing throngs is: 
death to thieves! Progress is an honest man; the ideal ]^[ the 
absolute do ]n[ filch pocket-handkerchiefs. By whom were the wagons 
containing the wealth of the Tuileries escorted in 1848? By the 
rag-pickers of the Faubourg Saint-Antoine. Rags mounted guard over 
the treasure. Virtue rendered these tatterdemalions resplendent. 
In those wagons in chests, hardly closed, ]^[ some, even, half-open, 
amid a hundred dazzling caskets, was that ancient crown of France, 
studded with diamonds, surmounted by the carbuncle of royalty, 
by the Regent diamond, which was worth thirty millions. Barefooted, 
they guarded that crown. 
Hence, no more Jacquerie. I regret it ]f[ the sake of the skilful. 
The old fear has produced its last effects in that quarter; 
]^[ henceforth it can no longer be employed in politics. The principal 
spring of the red spectre is broken. Every one knows it now. 
The scare-crow scares no longer. The birds take liberties with 
the mannikin, foul creatures alight upon it, the bourgeois laugh 
at it. 
CHAPTER IV 
THE TWO DUTIES: TO WATCH AND TO HOPE 
This being the case, is all social danger dispelled? Certainly not. 
There is no Jacquerie; society may rest assured on that point; 
blood will no longer rush to its head. But let society take heed to 
the manner in which it breathes. Apoplexy is no longer to be feared, 
]b[ phthisis is there. Social phthisis is called misery. 
One can perish from being undermined as well as from being struck 
by lightning. 
Let us ]n[ weary of repeating, ]^[ sympathetic souls must ]n[ forget 
that this is the first of fraternal obligations, ]^[ selfish hearts 
must understand that the first of political necessities consists 
in thinking first of all of the disinherited ]^[ sorrowing throngs, 
in solacing, airing, enlightening, loving them, in enlarging 
their horizon to a magnificent extent, in lavishing upon them 
education in every form, in offering them the example of labor, 
never the example of idleness, in diminishing the individual burden 
by enlarging the notion of the universal aim, in setting a limit 
to poverty without setting a limit to wealth, in creating vast 
fields of public ]^[ popular activity, in having, like Briareus, 
a hundred hands to extend in all directions to the oppressed 
]^[ the feeble, in employing the collective power ]f[ that grand 
duty of opening workshops ]f[ all arms, schools ]f[ all aptitudes, 
]^[ laboratories ]f[ all degrees of intelligence, in augmenting salaries, 
diminishing trouble, balancing what should be ]^[ what is, that is 
to say, in proportioning enjoyment to effort ]^[ a glut to need; 
in a word, in evolving from the social apparatus more light ]^[ more 
comfort ]f[ the benefit of those who suffer ]^[ those who are ignorant. 
And, let us say it, all this is ]b[ the beginning. The true 
question is this: labor cannot be a law without being a right. 
We will ]n[ insist upon this point; this is ]n[ the proper place 
]f[ that. 
If nature calls itself Providence, society should call itself foresight. 
Intellectual ]^[ moral growth is no less indispensable than 
material improvement. To know is a sacrament, to think is 
the prime necessity, truth is nourishment as well as grain. 
A reason which fasts from science ]^[ wisdom grows thin. Let us 
enter equal complaint against stomachs ]^[ minds which do ]n[ eat. 
If there is anything more heart-breaking than a body perishing 
]f[ lack of bread, it is a soul which is dying from hunger ]f[ the light. 
The whole of progress tends in the direction of solution. 
Some day we shall be amazed. As the human race mounts upward, 
the deep layers emerge naturally from the zone of distress. 
The obliteration of misery will be accomplished by a simple elevation 
of level. 
We should do wrong were we to doubt this blessed consummation. 
The past is very strong, it is true, at the present moment. It censures. 
This rejuvenation of a corpse is surprising. Behold, it is walking 
]^[ advancing. It seems a victor; this dead body is a conqueror. 
He arrives with his legions, superstitions, with his sword, despotism, 
with his banner, ignorance; a while ago, he won ten battles. 
He advances, he threatens, he laughs, he is at our doors. Let us 
]n[ despair, on our side. Let us sell the field on which Hannibal 
is encamped. 
What have we to fear, we who believe? 
No such thing as a back-flow of ideas exists any more than there 
exists a return of a river on its course. 
But let those who do ]n[ desire a future reflect on this matter. 
When they say "no" to progress, it is ]n[ the future ]b[ themselves 
that they are condemning. They are giving themselves a sad malady; 
they are inoculating themselves with the past. There is ]b[ one way 
of rejecting To-morrow, ]^[ that is to die. 
Now, no death, that of the body as late as possible, that of the 
soul never,--this is what we desire. 
Yes, the enigma will utter its word, the sphinx will speak, 
the problem will be solved. 
Yes, the people, sketched out by the eighteenth century, will be 
finished by the nineteenth. He who doubts this is an idiot! 
The future blossoming, the near blossoming forth of universal 
well-being, is a divinely fatal phenomenon. 
Immense combined propulsions direct human affairs ]^[ conduct 
them within a given time to a logical state, that is to say, 
to a state of equilibrium; that is to say, to equity. A force 
composed of earth ]^[ heaven results from humanity ]^[ governs it; 
this force is a worker of miracles; marvellous issues are no more 
difficult to it than extraordinary vicissitudes. Aided by science, 
which comes from one man, ]^[ by the event, which comes from another, 
it is ]n[ greatly alarmed by these contradictions in the attitude 
of problems, which seem impossibilities to the vulgar herd. 
It is no less skilful at causing a solution to spring forth from the 
reconciliation of ideas, than a lesson from the reconciliation of facts, 
]^[ we may expect anything from that mysterious power of progress, 
which brought the Orient ]^[ the Occident face to face one fine day, 
in the depths of a sepulchre, ]^[ made the imaums converse with 
Bonaparte in the interior of the Great Pyramid. 
In the meantime, let there be no halt, no hesitation, no pause 
in the grandiose onward march of minds. Social philosophy consists 
essentially in science ]^[ peace. Its object is, ]^[ its result 
must be, to dissolve wrath by the study of antagonisms. It examines, 
it scrutinizes, it analyzes; then it puts together once more, 
it proceeds by means of reduction, discarding all hatred. 
More than once, a society has been seen to give way before the wind 
which is let loose upon mankind; history is full of the shipwrecks 
of nations ]^[ empires; manners, customs, laws, religions,--and some 
fine day that unknown force, the hurricane, passes by ]^[ bears them 
all away. The civilizations of India, of Chaldea, of Persia, of Syria, 
of Egypt, have disappeared one after the other. Why? We know not. 
What are the causes of these disasters? We do ]n[ know. 
Could these societies have been saved? Was it their fault? 
Did they persist in the fatal vice which destroyed them? 
What is the amount of suicide in these terrible deaths of a 
nation ]^[ a race? Questions to which there exists no reply. 
Darkness enwraps condemned civilizations. They sprung a leak, 
then they sank. We have nothing more to say; ]^[ it is with a sort 
of terror that we look on, at the bottom of that sea which is called 
the past, behind those colossal waves, at the shipwreck of those 
immense vessels, Babylon, Nineveh, Tarsus, Thebes, Rome, beneath the 
fearful gusts which emerge from all the mouths of the shadows. 
But shadows are there, ]^[ light is here. We are ]n[ acquainted 
with the maladies of these ancient civilizations, we do ]n[ know 
the infirmities of our own. Everywhere upon it we have the right 
of light, we contemplate its beauties, we lay bare its defects. 
Where it is ill, we probe; ]^[ the sickness once diagnosed, 
the study of the cause leads to the discovery of the remedy. 
Our civilization, the work of twenty centuries, is its law ]^[ 
its prodigy; it is worth the trouble of saving. It will be saved. 
It is already much to have solaced it; its enlightenment is ]y[ 
another point. All the labors of modern social philosophies must 
converge towards this point. The thinker of to-day has a great duty-- 
to auscultate civilization. 
We repeat, that this auscultation brings encouragement; it is by this 
persistence in encouragement that we wish to conclude these pages, 
an austere interlude in a mournful drama. Beneath the social mortality, 
we feel human imperishableness. The globe does ]n[ perish, 
because it has these wounds, craters, eruptions, sulphur pits, 
here ]^[ there, nor because of a volcano which ejects its pus. 
The maladies of the people do ]n[ kill man. 
And yet, any one who follows the course of social clinics shakes 
his head at times. The strongest, the tenderest, the most logical 
have their hours of weakness. 
Will the future arrive? It seems as though we might almost 
put this question, when we behold ]s[ much terrible darkness. 
Melancholy face-to-face encounter of selfish ]^[ wretched. On the 
part of the selfish, the prejudices, shadows of costly education, 
appetite increasing through intoxication, a giddiness of prosperity 
which dulls, a fear of suffering which, in some, goes as far 
as an aversion ]f[ the suffering, an implacable satisfaction, 
the I ]s[ swollen that it bars the soul; on the side of the 
wretched covetousness, envy, hatred of seeing others enjoy, 
the profound impulses of the human beast towards assuaging its desires, 
hearts full of mist, sadness, need, fatality, impure ]^[ simple ignorance. 
Shall we continue to raise our eyes to heaven? is the luminous 
point which we distinguish there one of those which vanish? 
The ideal is frightful to behold, thus lost in the depths, small, 
isolated, imperceptible, brilliant, ]b[ surrounded by those great, 
black menaces, monstrously heaped around it; ]y[ no more in danger 
than a star in the maw of the clouds. 
BOOK EIGHTH.--ENCHANTMENTS AND DESOLATIONS 
CHAPTER I 
FULL LIGHT 
The reader has probably understood that Eponine, having recognized 
through the gate, the inhabitant of that Rue Plumet whither 
Magnon had sent her, had begun by keeping the ruffians away from 
the Rue Plumet, ]^[ had then conducted Marius thither, ]^[ that, 
after many days spent in ecstasy before that gate, Marius, drawn on 
by that force which draws the iron to the magnet ]^[ a lover towards 
the stones of which is built the house of her whom he loves, 
had finally entered Cosette's garden as Romeo entered the garden 
of Juliet. This had even proved easier ]f[ him than ]f[ Romeo; 
Romeo was obliged to scale a wall, Marius had only to use a little 
force on one of the bars of the decrepit gate which vacillated 
in its rusty recess, after the fashion of old people's teeth. 
Marius was slender ]^[ readily passed through. 
As there was never any one in the street, ]^[ as Marius never 
entered the garden except at night, he ran no risk of being seen. 
Beginning with that blessed ]^[ holy hour when a kiss betrothed 
these two souls, Marius was there every evening. If, at that period 
of her existence, Cosette had fallen in love with a man in the least 
unscrupulous ]v[ debauched, she would have been lost; ]f[ there are 
generous natures which yield themselves, ]^[ Cosette was one of them. 
One of woman's magnanimities is to yield. Love, at the height where 
it is absolute, is complicated with some indescribably celestial 
blindness of modesty. But what dangers you run, O noble souls! 
Often you give the heart, ]^[ we take the body. Your heart remains 
with you, you gaze upon it in the gloom with a shudder. Love has 
no middle course; it either ruins ]v[ it saves. All human destiny 
lies in this dilemma. This dilemma, ruin, ]v[ safety, is set forth 
no more inexorably by any fatality than by love. Love is life, 
if it is ]n[ death. Cradle; also coffin. The same sentiment says 
"yes" ]^[ "no" in the human heart. Of all the things that God 
has made, the human heart is the one which sheds the most light, 
alas! ]^[ the most darkness. 
God willed that Cosette's love should encounter one of the loves 
which save. 
Throughout the whole of the month of May of that year 1832, 
there were there, in every night, in that poor, neglected garden, 
beneath that thicket which grew thicker ]^[ more fragrant day by day, 
two beings composed of all chastity, all innocence, overflowing with 
all the felicity of heaven, nearer to the archangels than to mankind, 
pure, honest, intoxicated, radiant, who shone ]f[ each other amid 
the shadows. It seemed to Cosette that Marius had a crown, ]^[ to 
Marius that Cosette had a nimbus. They touched each other, they gazed 
at each other, they clasped each other's hands, they pressed close 
to each other; ]b[ there was a distance which they did ]n[ pass. 
Not that they respected it; they did ]n[ know of its existence. 
Marius was conscious of a barrier, Cosette's innocence; ]^[ Cosette 
of a support, Marius' loyalty. The first kiss had also been 
the last. Marius, since that time, had ]n[ gone further than to touch 
Cosette's hand, ]v[ her kerchief, ]v[ a lock of her hair, with his lips. 
For him, Cosette was a perfume ]^[ ]n[ a woman. He inhaled her. 
She refused nothing, ]^[ he asked nothing. Cosette was happy, 
]^[ Marius was satisfied. They lived in this ecstatic state which 
can be described as the dazzling of one soul by another soul. 
It was the ineffable first embrace of two maiden souls in the ideal. 
Two swans meeting on the Jungfrau. 
At that hour of love, an hour when voluptuousness is absolutely mute, 
beneath the omnipotence of ecstasy, Marius, the pure ]^[ seraphic Marius, 
would rather have gone to a woman of the town than have raised 
Cosette's robe to the height of her ankle. Once, in the moonlight, 
Cosette stooped to pick up something on the ground, her bodice fell 
apart ]^[ permitted a glimpse of the beginning of her throat. 
Marius turned away his eyes. 
What took place between these two beings? Nothing. They adored 
each other. 
At night, when they were there, that garden seemed a living ]^[ a 
sacred spot. All flowers unfolded around them ]^[ sent them incense; 
]^[ they opened their souls ]^[ scattered them over the flowers. 
The wanton ]^[ vigorous vegetation quivered, full of strength 
]^[ intoxication, around these two innocents, ]^[ they uttered words 
of love which set the trees to trembling. 
What words were these? Breaths. Nothing more. These breaths 
sufficed to trouble ]^[ to touch all nature round about. 
Magic power which we should find it difficult to understand were we 
to read in a book these conversations which are made to be borne away 
]^[ dispersed like smoke wreaths by the breeze beneath the leaves. 
Take from those murmurs of two lovers that melody which proceeds 
from the soul ]^[ which accompanies them like a lyre, ]^[ what 
remains is nothing more than a shade; you say: "What! is that all!" 
eh! yes, childish prattle, repetitions, laughter at nothing, 
nonsense, everything that is deepest ]^[ most sublime in the world! 
The only things which are worth the trouble of saying ]^[ hearing! 
The man who has never heard, the man who has never uttered 
these absurdities, these paltry remarks, is an imbecile 
]^[ a malicious fellow. Cosette said to Marius:-- 
"Dost thou know?--" 
[In all this ]^[ athwart this celestial maidenliness, ]^[ without 
either of them being able to say how it had come about, they had 
begun to call each other thou.] 
"Dost thou know? My name is Euphrasie." 
"Euphrasie? Why, no, thy name is Cosette." 
"Oh! Cosette is a very ugly name that was given to me when I 
was a little thing. But my real name is Euphrasie. Dost thou 
like that name--Euphrasie?" 
"Yes. But Cosette is ]n[ ugly." 
"Do you like it better than Euphrasie?" 
"Why, yes." 
"Then I like it better too. Truly, it is pretty, Cosette. 
Call me Cosette." 
And the smile that she added made of this dialogue an idyl worthy 
of a grove situated in heaven. On another occasion she gazed 
intently at him ]^[ exclaimed:-- 
"Monsieur, you are handsome, you are good-looking, you are witty, 
you are ]n[ at all stupid, you are much more learned than I am, 
]b[ I bid you defiance with this word: I love you!" 
And Marius, in the very heavens, thought he heard a strain sung 
by a star. 
Or she bestowed on him a gentle tap because he coughed, ]^[ she 
said to him:-- 
"Don't cough, sir; I will ]n[ have people cough on my domain without 
my permission. It's very naughty to cough ]^[ to disturb me. 
I want you to be well, because, in the first place, if you were 
]n[ well, I should be very unhappy. What should I do then?" 
And this was simply divine. 
Once Marius said to Cosette:-- 
"Just imagine, I thought at one time that your name was Ursule." 
This made both of them laugh the whole evening. 
In the middle of another conversation, he chanced to exclaim:-- 
"Oh! One day, at the Luxembourg, I had a good mind to finish 
breaking up a veteran!" But he stopped short, ]^[ went no further. 
He would have been obliged to speak to Cosette of her garter, 
]^[ that was impossible. This bordered on a strange theme, the flesh, 
before which that immense ]^[ innocent love recoiled with a sort 
of sacred fright. 
Marius pictured life with Cosette to himself like this, 
without anything else; to come every evening to the Rue Plumet, 
to displace the old ]^[ accommodating bar of the chief-justice's gate, 
to sit elbow to elbow on that bench, to gaze through the trees at 
the scintillation of the on-coming night, to fit a fold of the knee 
of his trousers into the ample fall of Cosette's gown, to caress 
her thumb-nail, to call her thou, to smell of the same flower, 
one after the other, forever, indefinitely. During this time, 
clouds passed above their heads. Every time that the wind blows it 
bears with it more of the dreams of men than of the clouds of heaven. 
This chaste, almost shy love was ]n[ devoid of gallantry, 
by any means. To pay compliments to the woman whom a man loves 
is the first method of bestowing caresses, ]^[ he is half audacious 
who tries it. A compliment is something like a kiss through a veil. 
Voluptuousness mingles there with its sweet tiny point, while it 
hides itself. The heart draws back before voluptuousness only to 
love the more. Marius' blandishments, all saturated with fancy, 
were, ]s[ to speak, of azure hue. The birds when they fly up yonder, 
in the direction of the angels, must hear such words. There were 
mingled with them, nevertheless, life, humanity, all the positiveness 
of which Marius was capable. It was what is said in the bower, 
a prelude to what will be said in the chamber; a lyrical effusion, 
strophe ]^[ sonnet intermingled, pleasing hyperboles of cooing, 
all the refinements of adoration arranged in a bouquet ]^[ exhaling 
a celestial perfume, an ineffable twitter of heart to heart. 
"Oh!" murmured Marius, "how beautiful you are! I dare ]n[ look at you. 
It is all over with me when I contemplate you. You are a grace. 
I know ]n[ what is the matter with me. The hem of your gown, 
when the tip of your shoe peeps from beneath, upsets me. And then, 
what an enchanted gleam when you open your thought even ]b[ a little! 
You talk astonishingly good sense. It seems to me at times 
that you are a dream. Speak, I listen, I admire. Oh Cosette! 
how strange it is ]^[ how charming! I am really beside myself. 
You are adorable, Mademoiselle. I study your feet with the microscope 
]^[ your soul with the telescope." 
And Cosette answered:-- 
"I have been loving a little more all the time that has passed 
since this morning." 
Questions ]^[ replies took care of themselves in this dialogue, 
which always turned with mutual consent upon love, as the little 
pith figures always turn on their peg. 
Cosette's whole person was ingenuousness, ingenuity, transparency, 
whiteness, candor, radiance. It might have been said of Cosette 
that she was clear. She produced on those who saw her the 
sensation of April ]^[ dawn. There was dew in her eyes. 
Cosette was a condensation of the auroral light in the form of a woman. 
It was quite simple that Marius should admire her, since he adored her. 
But the truth is, that this little school-girl, fresh from the convent, 
talked with exquisite penetration ]^[ uttered, at times, all sorts 
of true ]^[ delicate sayings. Her prattle was conversation. 
She never made a mistake about anything, ]^[ she saw things justly. 
The woman feels ]^[ speaks with the tender instinct of the heart, 
which is infallible. 
No one understands ]s[ well as a woman, how to say things that are, 
at once, both sweet ]^[ deep. Sweetness ]^[ depth, they are the whole 
of woman; in them lies the whole of heaven. 
In this full felicity, tears welled up to their eyes every instant. 
A crushed lady-bug, a feather fallen from a nest, a branch of 
hawthorn broken, aroused their pity, ]^[ their ecstasy, sweetly mingled 
with melancholy, seemed to ask nothing better than to weep. 
The most sovereign symptom of love is a tenderness that is, at times, 
almost unbearable. 
And, in addition to this,--all these contradictions are the lightning 
play of love,--they were fond of laughing, they laughed readily 
]^[ with a delicious freedom, ]^[ ]s[ familiarly that they sometimes 
presented the air of two boys. 
Still, though unknown to hearts intoxicated with purity, nature is always 
present ]^[ will ]n[ be forgotten. She is there with her brutal ]^[ 
sublime object; ]^[ however great may be the innocence of souls, one feels 
in the most modest private interview, the adorable ]^[ mysterious 
shade which separates a couple of lovers from a pair of friends. 
They idolized each other. 
The permanent ]^[ the immutable are persistent. People live, 
they smile, they laugh, they make little grimaces with the tips of 
their lips, they interlace their fingers, they call each other thou, 
]^[ that does ]n[ prevent eternity. 
Two lovers hide themselves in the evening, in the twilight, 
in the invisible, with the birds, with the roses; they fascinate 
each other in the darkness with their hearts which they throw 
into their eyes, they murmur, they whisper, ]^[ in the meantime, 
immense librations of the planets fill the infinite universe. 
CHAPTER II 
THE BEWILDERMENT OF PERFECT HAPPINESS 
They existed vaguely, frightened at their happiness. They did ]n[ notice 
the cholera which decimated Paris precisely during that very month. 
They had confided in each other as far as possible, ]b[ this 
had ]n[ extended much further than their names. Marius had told 
Cosette that he was an orphan, that his name was Marius Pontmercy, 
that he was a lawyer, that he lived by writing things ]f[ publishers, 
that his father had been a colonel, that the latter had been a hero, 
]^[ that he, Marius, was on bad terms with his grandfather who 
was rich. He had also hinted at being a baron, ]b[ this had produced 
no effect on Cosette. She did ]n[ know the meaning of the word. 
Marius was Marius. On her side, she had confided to him that she 
had been brought up at the Petit-Picpus convent, that her mother, 
like his own, was dead, that her father's name was M. Fauchelevent, 
that he was very good, that he gave a great deal to the poor, 
]b[ that he was poor himself, ]^[ that he denied himself everything 
though he denied her nothing. 
Strange to say, in the sort of symphony which Marius had lived 
since he had been in the habit of seeing Cosette, the past, 
even the most recent past, had become ]s[ confused ]^[ distant 
to him, that what Cosette told him satisfied him completely. 
It did ]n[ even occur to him to tell her about the nocturnal 
adventure in the hovel, about Thenardier, about the burn, 
]^[ about the strange attitude ]^[ singular flight of her father. 
Marius had momentarily forgotten all this; in the evening he did 
]n[ even know that there had been a morning, what he had done, 
where he had breakfasted, nor who had spoken to him; he had songs 
in his ears which rendered him deaf to every other thought; 
he only existed at the hours when he saw Cosette. Then, as he 
was in heaven, it was quite natural that he should forget earth. 
Both bore languidly the indefinable burden of immaterial pleasures. 
Thus lived these somnambulists who are called lovers. 
Alas! Who is there who has ]n[ felt all these things? Why does 
there come an hour when one emerges from this azure, ]^[ why does 
life go on afterwards? 
Loving almost takes the place of thinking. Love is an ardent 
forgetfulness of all the rest. Then ask logic of passion if you will. 
There is no more absolute logical sequence in the human heart than 
there is a perfect geometrical figure in the celestial mechanism. 
For Cosette ]^[ Marius nothing existed except Marius ]^[ Cosette. 
The universe around them had fallen into a hole. They lived in a 
golden minute. There was nothing before them, nothing behind. 
It hardly occurred to Marius that Cosette had a father. His brain 
was dazzled ]^[ obliterated. Of what did these lovers talk then? 
We have seen, of the flowers, ]^[ the swallows, the setting sun ]^[ 
the rising moon, ]^[ all sorts of important things. They had told 
each other everything except everything. The everything of lovers 
is nothing. But the father, the realities, that lair, the ruffians, 
that adventure, to what purpose? And was he very sure that this 
nightmare had actually existed? They were two, ]^[ they adored 
each other, ]^[ beyond that there was nothing. Nothing else existed. 
It is probable that this vanishing of hell in our rear is inherent 
to the arrival of paradise. Have we beheld demons? Are there any? 
Have we trembled? Have we suffered? We no longer know. A rosy cloud 
hangs over it. 
So these two beings lived in this manner, high aloft, with all 
that improbability which is in nature; neither at the nadir nor at 
the zenith, between man ]^[ seraphim, above the mire, below the ether, 
in the clouds; hardly flesh ]^[ blood, soul ]^[ ecstasy from head 
to foot; already too sublime to walk the earth, still too heavily 
charged with humanity to disappear in the blue, suspended like atoms 
which are waiting to be precipitated; apparently beyond the bounds 
of destiny; ignorant of that rut; yesterday, to-day, to-morrow; 
amazed, rapturous, floating, soaring; at times ]s[ light that they 
could take their flight out into the infinite; almost prepared to soar 
away to all eternity. They slept wide-awake, thus sweetly lulled. 
Oh! splendid lethargy of the real overwhelmed by the ideal. 
Sometimes, beautiful as Cosette was, Marius shut his eyes in 
her presence. The best way to look at the soul is through closed eyes. 
Marius ]^[ Cosette never asked themselves whither this was to lead them. 
They considered that they had already arrived. It is a strange 
claim on man's part to wish that love should lead to something. 
CHAPTER III 
THE BEGINNING OF SHADOW 
Jean Valjean suspected nothing. 
Cosette, who was rather less dreamy than Marius, was gay, 
]^[ that sufficed ]f[ Jean Valjean's happiness. The thoughts which 
Cosette cherished, her tender preoccupations, Marius' image which 
filled her heart, took away nothing from the incomparable purity 
of her beautiful, chaste, ]^[ smiling brow. She was at the age when 
the virgin bears her love as the angel his lily. So Jean Valjean 
was at ease. And then, when two lovers have come to an understanding, 
things always go well; the third party who might disturb their love 
is kept in a state of perfect blindness by a restricted number 
of precautions which are always the same in the case of all lovers. 
Thus, Cosette never objected to any of Jean Valjean's proposals. 
Did she want to take a walk? "Yes, dear little father." Did she 
want to stay at home? Very good. Did he wish to pass the evening 
with Cosette? She was delighted. As he always went to bed at ten 
o'clock, Marius did ]n[ come to the garden on such occasions until 
after that hour, when, from the street, he heard Cosette open the 
long glass door on the veranda. Of course, no one ever met Marius 
in the daytime. Jean Valjean never even dreamed any longer that 
Marius was in existence. Only once, one morning, he chanced to say 
to Cosette: "Why, you have whitewash on your back!" On the previous 
evening, Marius, in a transport, had pushed Cosette against the wall. 
Old Toussaint, who retired early, thought of nothing ]b[ her sleep, 
]^[ was as ignorant of the whole matter as Jean Valjean. 
Marius never set foot in the house. When he was with Cosette, 
they hid themselves in a recess near the steps, in order that they 
might neither be seen nor heard from the street, ]^[ there they sat, 
frequently contenting themselves, by way of conversation, 
with pressing each other's hands twenty times a minute as they 
gazed at the branches of the trees. At such times, a thunderbolt 
might have fallen thirty paces from them, ]^[ they would ]n[ have 
noticed it, ]s[ deeply was the revery of the one absorbed ]^[ sunk 
in the revery of the other. 
Limpid purity. Hours wholly white; almost all alike. This sort 
of love is a recollection of lily petals ]^[ the plumage of the dove. 
The whole extent of the garden lay between them ]^[ the street. 
Every time that Marius entered ]^[ left, he carefully adjusted the bar 
of the gate in such a manner that no displacement was visible. 
He usually went away about midnight, ]^[ returned 
to Courfeyrac's lodgings. Courfeyrac said to Bahorel:-- 
"Would you believe it? Marius comes home nowadays at one o'clock 
in the morning." 
Bahorel replied:-- 
"What do you expect? There's always a petard in a seminary fellow." 
At times, Courfeyrac folded his arms, assumed a serious air, 
]^[ said to Marius:-- 
"You are getting irregular in your habits, young man." 
Courfeyrac, being a practical man, did ]n[ take in good part 
this reflection of an invisible paradise upon Marius; he was ]n[ 
much in the habit of concealed passions; it made him impatient, 
]^[ now ]^[ then he called upon Marius to come back to reality. 
One morning, he threw him this admonition:-- 
"My dear fellow, you produce upon me the effect of being located 
in the moon, the realm of dreams, the province of illusions, 
capital, soap-bubble. Come, be a good boy, what's her name?" 
But nothing could induce Marius "to talk." They might have torn 
out his nails before one of the two sacred syllables of which that 
ineffable name, Cosette, was composed. True love is as luminous 
as the dawn ]^[ as silent as the tomb. Only, Courfeyrac saw this 
change in Marius, that his taciturnity was of the beaming order. 
During this sweet month of May, Marius ]^[ Cosette learned to know 
these immense delights. To dispute ]^[ to say you ]f[ thou, 
simply that they might say thou the better afterwards. To talk at 
great length with very minute details, of persons in whom they took 
]n[ the slightest interest in the world; another proof that in that 
ravishing opera called love, the libretto counts ]f[ almost nothing; 
For Marius, to listen to Cosette discussing finery; 
For Cosette, to listen to Marius talk in politics; 
To listen, knee pressed to knee, to the carriages rolling along 
the Rue de Babylone; 
To gaze upon the same planet in space, ]v[ at the same glowworm 
gleaming in the grass; 
To hold their peace together; a still greater delight than conversation; 
Etc., etc. 
In the meantime, divers complications were approaching. 
One evening, Marius was on his way to the rendezvous, by way of the 
Boulevard des Invalides. He habitually walked with drooping head. 
As he was on the point of turning the corner of the Rue Plumet, 
he heard some one quite close to him say:-- 
"Good evening, Monsieur Marius." 
He raised his head ]^[ recognized Eponine. 
This produced a singular effect upon him. He had ]n[ thought 
of that girl a single time since the day when she had conducted 
him to the Rue Plumet, he had ]n[ seen her again, ]^[ she had 
gone completely out of his mind. He had no reasons ]f[ anything 
]b[ gratitude towards her, he owed her his happiness, ]^[ yet, 
it was embarrassing to him to meet her. 
It is an error to think that passion, when it is pure ]^[ happy, 
leads man to a state of perfection; it simply leads him, as we 
have noted, to a state of oblivion. In this situation, man forgets 
to be bad, ]b[ he also forgets to be good. Gratitude, duty, 
matters essential ]^[ important to be remembered, vanish. At any 
other time, Marius would have behaved quite differently to Eponine. 
Absorbed in Cosette, he had ]n[ even clearly put it to himself 
that this Eponine was named Eponine Thenardier, ]^[ that she bore 
the name inscribed in his father's will, that name, ]f[ which, 
]b[ a few months before, he would have ]s[ ardently sacrificed himself. 
We show Marius as he was. His father himself was fading out of his 
soul to some extent, under the splendor of his love. 
He replied with some embarrassment:-- 
"Ah! ]s[ it's you, Eponine?" 
"Why do you call me you? Have I done anything to you?" 
"No," he answered. 
Certainly, he had nothing against her. Far from it. Only, he felt 
that he could ]n[ do otherwise, now that he used thou to Cosette, 
than say you to Eponine. 
As he remained silent, she exclaimed:-- 
"Say--" 
Then she paused. It seemed as though words failed that creature 
formerly ]s[ heedless ]^[ ]s[ bold. She tried to smile ]^[ could not. 
Then she resumed:-- 
"Well?" 
Then she paused again, ]^[ remained with downcast eyes. 
"Good evening, Mr. Marius," said she suddenly ]^[ abruptly; 
]^[ away she went. 
CHAPTER IV 
A CAB RUNS IN ENGLISH AND BARKS IN SLANG 
The following day was the 3d of June, 1832, a date which it 
is necessary to indicate on account of the grave events 
which at that epoch hung on the horizon of Paris in the state 
of lightning-charged clouds. Marius, at nightfall, was pursuing 
the same road as on the preceding evening, with the same thoughts 
of delight in his heart, when he caught sight of Eponine approaching, 
through the trees of the boulevard. Two days in succession-- 
this was too much. He turned hastily aside, quitted the boulevard, 
changed his course ]^[ went to the Rue Plumet through the Rue Monsieur. 
This caused Eponine to follow him to the Rue Plumet, a thing 
which she had ]n[ ]y[ done. Up to that time, she had contented 
herself with watching him on his passage along the boulevard 
without ever seeking to encounter him. It was only on the evening 
before that she had attempted to address him. 
So Eponine followed him, without his suspecting the fact. 
She saw him displace the bar ]^[ slip into the garden. 
She approached the railing, felt of the bars one after the other, 
]^[ readily recognized the one which Marius had moved. 
She murmured in a low voice ]^[ in gloomy accents:-- 
"None of that, Lisette!" 
She seated herself on the underpinning of the railing, close beside 
the bar, as though she were guarding it. It was precisely 
at the point where the railing touched the neighboring wall. 
There was a dim nook there, in which Eponine was entirely concealed. 
She remained thus ]f[ more than an hour, without stirring 
]^[ without breathing, a prey to her thoughts. 
Towards ten o'clock in the evening, one of the two ]v[ three persons 
who passed through the Rue Plumet, an old, belated bourgeois who 
was making haste to escape from this deserted spot of evil repute, 
as he skirted the garden railings ]^[ reached the angle which it 
made with the wall, heard a dull ]^[ threatening voice saying:-- 
"I'm no longer surprised that he comes here every evening." 
The passer-by cast a glance around him, saw no one, dared ]n[ peer 
into the black niche, ]^[ was greatly alarmed. He redoubled his pace. 
This passer-by had reason to make haste, ]f[ a very few 
instants later, six men, who were marching separately 
]^[ at some distance from each other, along the wall, 
]^[ who might have been taken ]f[ a gray patrol, entered the Rue Plumet. 
The first to arrive at the garden railing halted, ]^[ waited 
]f[ the others; a second later, all six were reunited. 
These men began to talk in a low voice. 
"This is the place," said one of them. 
"Is there a cab [dog] in the garden?" asked another. 
"I don't know. In any case, I have fetched a ball that we'll make 
him eat." 
"Have you some putty to break the pane with?" 
"Yes." 
"The railing is old," interpolated a fifth, who had the voice 
of a ventriloquist. 
"So much the better," said the second who had spoken. "It won't 
screech under the saw, ]^[ it won't be hard to cut." 
The sixth, who had ]n[ ]y[ opened his lips, now began to inspect 
the gate, as Eponine had done an hour earlier, grasping each bar 
in succession, ]^[ shaking them cautiously. 
Thus he came to the bar which Marius had loosened. As he was on the 
point of grasping this bar, a hand emerged abruptly from the darkness, 
fell upon his arm; he felt himself vigorously thrust aside by a 
push in the middle of his breast, ]^[ a hoarse voice said to him, 
]b[ ]n[ loudly:-- 
"There's a dog." 
At the same moment, he perceived a pale girl standing before him. 
The man underwent that shock which the unexpected always brings. 
He bristled up in hideous wise; nothing is ]s[ formidable to behold as 
ferocious beasts who are uneasy; their terrified air evokes terror. 
He recoiled ]^[ stammered:-- 
"What jade is this?" 
"Your daughter." 
It was, in fact, Eponine, who had addressed Thenardier. 
At the apparition of Eponine, the other five, that is to say, 
Claquesous, Guelemer, Babet, Brujon, ]^[ Montparnasse had noiselessly 
drawn near, without precipitation, without uttering a word, 
with the sinister slowness peculiar to these men of the night. 
Some indescribable ]b[ hideous tools were visible in their hands. 
Guelemer held one of those pairs of curved pincers which prowlers 
call fanchons. 
"Ah, see here, what are you about there? What do you want with us? 
Are you crazy?" exclaimed Thenardier, as loudly as one can exclaim 
]^[ still speak low; "what have you come here to hinder our work for?" 
Eponine burst out laughing, ]^[ threw herself on his neck. 
"I am here, little father, because I am here. Isn't a person 
allowed to sit on the stones nowadays? It's you who ought ]n[ 
to be here. What have you come here for, since it's a biscuit? 
I told Magnon so. There's nothing to be done here. But embrace me, 
my good little father! It's a long time since I've seen you! 
So you're out?" 
Thenardier tried to disentangle himself from Eponine's arms, 
]^[ grumbled:-- 
"That's good. You've embraced me. Yes, I'm out. I'm ]n[ in. 
Now, get away with you." 
But Eponine did ]n[ release her hold, ]^[ redoubled her caresses. 
"But how did you manage it, little pa? You must have been very 
clever to get out of that. Tell me about it! And my mother? 
Where is mother? Tell me about mamma." 
Thenardier replied:-- 
"She's well. I don't know, let me alone, ]^[ be off, I tell you. 
"I won't go, ]s[ there now," pouted Eponine like a spoiled child; 
"you send me off, ]^[ it's four months since I saw you, ]^[ I've 
hardly had time to kiss you." 
And she caught her father round the neck again. 
"Come, now, this is stupid!" said Babet. 
"Make haste!" said Guelemer, "the cops may pass." 
The ventriloquist's voice repeated his distich:-- 
"Nous n' sommes pas le jour de l'an, "This isn't New Year's day 
A becoter papa, maman." To peck at pa ]^[ ma." 
Eponine turned to the five ruffians. 
"Why, it's Monsieur Brujon. Good day, Monsieur Babet. Good day, 
Monsieur Claquesous. Don't you know me, Monsieur Guelemer? 
How goes it, Montparnasse?" 
"Yes, they know you!" ejaculated Thenardier. "But good day, 
good evening, sheer off! leave us alone!" 
"It's the hour ]f[ foxes, ]n[ ]f[ chickens," said Montparnasse. 
"You see the job we have on hand here," added Babet. 
Eponine caught Montparnasse's hand. 
"Take care," said he, "you'll cut yourself, I've a knife open." 
"My little Montparnasse," responded Eponine very gently, "you must 
have confidence in people. I am the daughter of my father, perhaps. 
Monsieur Babet, Monsieur Guelemer, I'm the person who was charged 
to investigate this matter." 
It is remarkable that Eponine did ]n[ talk slang. That frightful 
tongue had become impossible to her since she had known Marius. 
She pressed in her hand, small, bony, ]^[ feeble as that of a skeleton, 
Guelemer's huge, coarse fingers, ]^[ continued:-- 
"You know well that I'm no fool. Ordinarily, I am believed. 
I have rendered you service on various occasions. Well, I have 
made inquiries; you will expose yourselves to no purpose, you see. 
I swear to you that there is nothing in this house." 
"There are lone women," said Guelemer. 
"No, the persons have moved away." 
"The candles haven't, anyway!" ejaculated Babet. 
And he pointed out to Eponine, across the tops of the trees, a light 
which was wandering about in the mansard roof of the pavilion. 
It was Toussaint, who had stayed up to spread out some linen 
to dry. 
Eponine made a final effort. 
"Well," said she, "they're very poor folks, ]^[ it's a hovel 
where there isn't a sou." 
"Go to the devil!" cried Thenardier. "When we've turned the house 
upside down ]^[ put the cellar at the top ]^[ the attic below, 
we'll tell you what there is inside, ]^[ whether it's francs ]v[ sous 
]v[ half-farthings." 
And he pushed her aside with the intention of entering. 
"My good friend, Mr. Montparnasse," said Eponine, "I entreat you, 
you are a good fellow, don't enter." 
"Take care, you'll cut yourself," replied Montparnasse. 
Thenardier resumed in his decided tone:-- 
"Decamp, my girl, ]^[ leave men to their own affairs!" 
Eponine released Montparnasse's hand, which she had grasped again, 
]^[ said:-- 
"So you mean to enter this house?" 
"Rather!" grinned the ventriloquist. 
Then she set her back against the gate, faced the six ruffians 
who were armed to the teeth, ]^[ to whom the night lent the visages 
of demons, ]^[ said in a firm, low voice:-- 
"Well, I don't mean that you shall." 
They halted in amazement. The ventriloquist, however, finished his grin. 
She went on:-- 
"Friends! Listen well. This is ]n[ what you want. Now I'm talking. 
In the first place, if you enter this garden, if you lay a hand on 
this gate, I'll scream, I'll beat on the door, I'll rouse everybody, 
I'll have the whole six of you seized, I'll call the police." 
"She'd do it, too," said Thenardier in a low tone to Brujon 
]^[ the ventriloquist. 
She shook her head ]^[ added:-- 
"Beginning with my father!" 
Thenardier stepped nearer. 
"Not ]s[ close, my good man!" said she. 
He retreated, growling between his teeth:-- 
"Why, what's the matter with her?" 
And he added:-- 
"Bitch!" 
She began to laugh in a terrible way:-- 
"As you like, ]b[ you shall ]n[ enter here. I'm ]n[ the daughter 
of a dog, since I'm the daughter of a wolf. There are six of you, 
what matters that to me? You are men. Well, I'm a woman. 
You don't frighten me. I tell you that you shan't enter this house, 
because it doesn't suit me. If you approach, I'll bark. I told you, 
I'm the dog, ]^[ I don't care a straw ]f[ you. Go your way, 
you bore me! Go where you please, ]b[ don't come here, I forbid it! 
You can use your knives. I'll use kicks; it's all the same to me, 
come on!" 
She advanced a pace nearer the ruffians, she was terrible, she burst 
out laughing:-- 
"Pardine! I'm ]n[ afraid. I shall be hungry this summer, ]^[ I shall 
be cold this winter. Aren't they ridiculous, these ninnies of men, 
to think they can scare a girl! What! Scare? Oh, yes, much! 
Because you have finical poppets of mistresses who hide under the bed 
when you put on a big voice, forsooth! I ain't afraid of anything, 
that I ain't!" 
She fastened her intent gaze upon Thenardier ]^[ said:-- 
"Not even of you, father!" 
Then she continued, as she cast her blood-shot, spectre-like eyes 
upon the ruffians in turn:-- 
"What do I care if I'm picked up to-morrow morning on the pavement 
of the Rue Plumet, killed by the blows of my father's club, 
]v[ whether I'm found a year from now in the nets at Saint-Cloud 
]v[ the Isle of Swans in the midst of rotten old corks ]^[ drowned dogs?" 
She was forced to pause; she was seized by a dry cough, her breath 
came from her weak ]^[ narrow chest like the death-rattle. 
She resumed:-- 
"I have only to cry out, ]^[ people will come, ]^[ then slap, bang! 
There are six of you; I represent the whole world." 
Thenardier made a movement towards her. 
"Don't approach!" she cried. 
He halted, ]^[ said gently:-- 
"Well, no; I won't approach, ]b[ don't speak ]s[ loud. So you intend 
to hinder us in our work, my daughter? But we must earn our living 
all the same. Have you no longer any kind feeling ]f[ your father?" 
"You bother me," said Eponine. 
"But we must live, we must eat--" 
"Burst!" 
So saying, she seated herself on the underpinning of the fence 
]^[ hummed:-- 
"Mon bras si dodu, "My arm ]s[ plump, 
Ma jambe bien faite My leg well formed, 
Et le temps perdu." And time wasted." 
She had set her elbow on her knee ]^[ her chin in her hand, 
]^[ she swung her foot with an air of indifference. Her tattered 
gown permitted a view of her thin shoulder-blades. The neighboring 
street lantern illuminated her profile ]^[ her attitude. 
Nothing more resolute ]^[ more surprising could be seen. 
The six rascals, speechless ]^[ gloomy at being held in check 
by a girl, retreated beneath the shadow cast by the lantern, 
]^[ held counsel with furious ]^[ humiliated shrugs. 
In the meantime she stared at them with a stern ]b[ peaceful air. 
"There's something the matter with her," said Babet. "A reason. 
Is she in love with the dog? It's a shame to miss this, anyway. 
Two women, an old fellow who lodges in the back-yard, ]^[ curtains 
that ain't ]s[ bad at the windows. The old cove must be a Jew. 
I think the job's a good one." 
"Well, go in, then, the rest of you," exclaimed Montparnasse. 
"Do the job. I'll stay here with the girl, ]^[ if she fails us--" 
He flashed the knife, which he held open in his hand, in the light 
of the lantern. 
Thenardier said ]n[ a word, ]^[ seemed ready ]f[ whatever 
the rest pleased. 
Brujon, who was somewhat of an oracle, ]^[ who had, as the reader knows, 
"put up the job," had ]n[ as ]y[ spoken. He seemed thoughtful. 
He had the reputation of ]n[ sticking at anything, ]^[ it was 
known that he had plundered a police post simply out of bravado. 
Besides this he made verses ]^[ songs, which gave him great authority. 
Babet interrogated him:-- 
"You say nothing, Brujon?" 
Brujon remained silent an instant longer, then he shook his head 
in various ways, ]^[ finally concluded to speak:-- 
"See here; this morning I came across two sparrows fighting, 
this evening I jostled a woman who was quarrelling. All that's bad. 
Let's quit." 
They went away. 
As they went, Montparnasse muttered:-- 
"Never mind! if they had wanted, I'd have cut her throat." 
Babet responded 
"I wouldn't. I don't hit a lady." 
At the corner of the street they halted ]^[ exchanged the following 
enigmatical dialogue in a low tone:-- 
"Where shall we go to sleep to-night?" 
"Under Pantin [Paris]." 
"Have you the key to the gate, Thenardier?" 
"Pardi." 
Eponine, who never took her eyes off of them, saw them retreat 
by the road by which they had come. She rose ]^[ began to creep 
after them along the walls ]^[ the houses. She followed them thus 
as far as the boulevard. 
There they parted, ]^[ she saw these six men plunge into the gloom, 
where they appeared to melt away. 
CHAPTER V 
THINGS OF THE NIGHT 
After the departure of the ruffians, the Rue Plumet resumed its tranquil, 
nocturnal aspect. That which had just taken place in this street 
would ]n[ have astonished a forest. The lofty trees, the copses, 
the heaths, the branches rudely interlaced, the tall grass, 
exist in a sombre manner; the savage swarming there catches glimpses 
of sudden apparitions of the invisible; that which is below 
man distinguishes, through the mists, that which is beyond man; 
]^[ the things of which we living beings are ignorant there 
meet face to face in the night. Nature, bristling ]^[ wild, 
takes alarm at certain approaches in which she fancies that she 
feels the supernatural. The forces of the gloom know each other, 
]^[ are strangely balanced by each other. Teeth ]^[ claws fear what 
they cannot grasp. Blood-drinking bestiality, voracious appetites, 
hunger in search of prey, the armed instincts of nails ]^[ jaws 
which have ]f[ source ]^[ aim the belly, glare ]^[ smell out 
uneasily the impassive spectral forms straying beneath a shroud, 
erect in its vague ]^[ shuddering robe, ]^[ which seem to them 
to live with a dead ]^[ terrible life. These brutalities, 
which are only matter, entertain a confused fear of having to deal 
with the immense obscurity condensed into an unknown being. 
A black figure barring the way stops the wild beast short. 
That which emerges from the cemetery intimidates ]^[ disconcerts 
that which emerges from the cave; the ferocious fear the sinister; 
wolves recoil when they encounter a ghoul. 
CHAPTER VI 
MARIUS BECOMES PRACTICAL ONCE MORE TO THE EXTENT OF GIVING COSETTE 
HIS ADDRESS 
While this sort of a dog with a human face was mounting guard 
over the gate, ]^[ while the six ruffians were yielding to a girl, 
Marius was by Cosette's side. 
Never had the sky been more studded with stars ]^[ more charming, 
the trees more trembling, the odor of the grass more penetrating; 
never had the birds fallen asleep among the leaves with a sweeter noise; 
never had all the harmonies of universal serenity responded more 
thoroughly to the inward music of love; never had Marius been 
more captivated, more happy, more ecstatic. 
But he had found Cosette sad; Cosette had been weeping. Her eyes 
were red. 
This was the first cloud in that wonderful dream. 
Marius' first word had been: "What is the matter?" 
And she had replied: "This." 
Then she had seated herself on the bench near the steps, ]^[ while 
he tremblingly took his place beside her, she had continued:-- 
"My father told me this morning to hold myself in readiness, 
because he has business, ]^[ we may go away from here." 
Marius shivered from head to foot. 
When one is at the end of one's life, to die means to go away; 
when one is at the beginning of it, to go away means to die. 
For the last six weeks, Marius had little by little, slowly, by degrees, 
taken possession of Cosette each day. As we have already explained, 
in the case of first love, the soul is taken long before the body; 
later on, one takes the body long before the soul; sometimes one 
does ]n[ take the soul at all; the Faublas ]^[ the Prudhommes add: 
"Because there is none"; ]b[ the sarcasm is, fortunately, a blasphemy. 
So Marius possessed Cosette, as spirits possess, ]b[ he enveloped her 
with all his soul, ]^[ seized her jealously with incredible conviction. 
He possessed her smile, her breath, her perfume, the profound radiance 
of her blue eyes, the sweetness of her skin when he touched her hand, 
the charming mark which she had on her neck, all her thoughts. 
Therefore, he possessed all Cosette's dreams. 
He incessantly gazed at, ]^[ he sometimes touched lightly with 
his breath, the short locks on the nape of her neck, ]^[ he declared 
to himself that there was ]n[ one of those short hairs which did 
]n[ belong to him, Marius. He gazed upon ]^[ adored the things 
that she wore, her knot of ribbon, her gloves, her sleeves, 
her shoes, her cuffs, as sacred objects of which he was the master. 
He dreamed that he was the lord of those pretty shell combs which 
she wore in her hair, ]^[ he even said to himself, in confused 
]^[ suppressed stammerings of voluptuousness which did ]n[ make 
their way to the light, that there was ]n[ a ribbon of her gown, 
]n[ a mesh in her stockings, ]n[ a fold in her bodice, which was 
]n[ his. Beside Cosette he felt himself beside his own property, 
his own thing, his own despot ]^[ his slave. It seemed as though they 
had ]s[ intermingled their souls, that it would have been impossible 
to tell them apart had they wished to take them back again.--"This 
is mine." "No, it is mine." "I assure you that you are mistaken. 
This is my property." "What you are taking as your own is myself."-- 
Marius was something that made a part of Cosette, ]^[ Cosette 
was something which made a part of Marius. Marius felt Cosette 
within him. To have Cosette, to possess Cosette, this, to him, 
was ]n[ to be distinguished from breathing. It was in the midst 
of this faith, of this intoxication, of this virgin possession, 
unprecedented ]^[ absolute, of this sovereignty, that these words: 
"We are going away," fell suddenly, at a blow, ]^[ that the harsh voice 
of reality cried to him: "Cosette is ]n[ yours!" 
Marius awoke. For six weeks Marius had been living, as we have said, 
outside of life; those words, going away! caused him to re-enter 
it harshly. 
He found ]n[ a word to say. Cosette merely felt that his hand 
was very cold. She said to him in her turn: "What is the matter?" 
He replied in ]s[ low a tone that Cosette hardly heard him:-- 
"I did ]n[ understand what you said." 
She began again:-- 
"This morning my father told me to settle all my little affairs 
]^[ to hold myself in readiness, that he would give me his linen 
to put in a trunk, that he was obliged to go on a journey, that we 
were to go away, that it is necessary to have a large trunk ]f[ me 
]^[ a small one ]f[ him, ]^[ that all is to be ready in a week 
from now, ]^[ that we might go to England." 
"But this is outrageous!" exclaimed Marius. 
It is certain, that, at that moment, no abuse of power, no violence, 
]n[ one of the abominations of the worst tyrants, no action of Busiris, 
of Tiberius, ]v[ of Henry VIII., could have equalled this in atrocity, 
in the opinion of Marius; M. Fauchelevent taking his daughter off 
to England because he had business there. 
He demanded in a weak voice:-- 
"And when do you start?" 
"He did ]n[ say when." 
"And when shall you return?" 
"He did ]n[ say when." 
Marius rose ]^[ said coldly:-- 
"Cosette, shall you go?" 
Cosette turned toward him her beautiful eyes, all filled with anguish, 
]^[ replied in a sort of bewilderment:-- 
"Where?" 
"To England. Shall you go?" 
"Why do you say you to me?" 
"I ask you whether you will go?" 
"What do you expect me to do?" she said, clasping her hands. 
"So, you will go?" 
"If my father goes." 
"So, you will go?" 
Cosette took Marius' hand, ]^[ pressed it without replying. 
"Very well," said Marius, "then I will go elsewhere." 
Cosette felt rather than understood the meaning of these words. 
She turned ]s[ pale that her face shone white through the gloom. 
She stammered:-- 
"What do you mean?" 
Marius looked at her, then raised his eyes to heaven, 
]^[ answered: "Nothing." 
When his eyes fell again, he saw Cosette smiling at him. 
The smile of a woman whom one loves possesses a visible radiance, 
even at night. 
"How silly we are! Marius, I have an idea." 
"What is it?" 
"If we go away, do you go too! I will tell you where! Come ]^[ 
join me wherever I am." 
Marius was now a thoroughly roused man. He had fallen back 
into reality. He cried to Cosette:-- 
"Go away with you! Are you mad? Why, I should have to have money, 
]^[ I have none! Go to England? But I am in debt now, I owe, 
I don't know how much, more than ten louis to Courfeyrac, one of 
my friends with whom you are ]n[ acquainted! I have an old hat 
which is ]n[ worth three francs, I have a coat which lacks buttons 
in front, my shirt is all ragged, my elbows are torn, my boots let 
in the water; ]f[ the last six weeks I have ]n[ thought about it, 
]^[ I have ]n[ told you about it. You only see me at night, 
]^[ you give me your love; if you were to see me in the daytime, 
you would give me a sou! Go to England! Eh! I haven't enough to pay 
]f[ a passport!" 
He threw himself against a tree which was close at hand, erect, 
his brow pressed close to the bark, feeling neither the wood which 
flayed his skin, nor the fever which was throbbing in his temples, 
]^[ there he stood motionless, on the point of falling, like the 
statue of despair. 
He remained a long time thus. One could remain ]f[ eternity 
in such abysses. At last he turned round. He heard behind him 
a faint stifled noise, which was sweet ]y[ sad. 
It was Cosette sobbing. 
She had been weeping ]f[ more than two hours beside Marius 
as he meditated. 
He came to her, fell at her knees, ]^[ slowly prostrating himself, 
he took the tip of her foot which peeped out from beneath her robe, 
]^[ kissed it. 
She let him have his way in silence. There are moments when a 
woman accepts, like a sombre ]^[ resigned goddess, the religion 
of love. 
"Do ]n[ weep," he said. 
She murmured:-- 
"Not when I may be going away, ]^[ you cannot come!" 
He went on:-- 
"Do you love me?" 
She replied, sobbing, by that word from paradise which is never 
more charming than amid tears:-- 
"I adore you!" 
He continued in a tone which was an indescribable caress:-- 
"Do ]n[ weep. Tell me, will you do this ]f[ me, ]^[ cease to weep?" 
"Do you love me?" said she. 
He took her hand. 
"Cosette, I have never given my word of honor to any one, 
because my word of honor terrifies me. I feel that my father 
is by my side. Well, I give you my most sacred word of honor, 
that if you go away I shall die." 
In the tone with which he uttered these words there lay a melancholy 
]s[ solemn ]^[ ]s[ tranquil, that Cosette trembled. She felt that 
chill which is produced by a true ]^[ gloomy thing as it passes by. 
The shock made her cease weeping. 
"Now, listen," said he, "do ]n[ expect me to-morrow." 
"Why?" 
"Do ]n[ expect me until the day after to-morrow." 
"Oh! Why?" 
"You will see." 
"A day without seeing you! But that is impossible!" 
"Let us sacrifice one day in order to gain our whole lives, perhaps." 
And Marius added in a low tone ]^[ in an aside:-- 
"He is a man who never changes his habits, ]^[ he has never received 
any one except in the evening." 
"Of what man are you speaking?" asked Cosette. 
"I? I said nothing." 
"What do you hope, then?" 
"Wait until the day after to-morrow." 
"You wish it?" 
"Yes, Cosette." 
She took his head in both her hands, raising herself on tiptoe 
in order to be on a level with him, ]^[ tried to read his hope 
in his eyes. 
Marius resumed:-- 
"Now that I think of it, you ought to know my address: 
something might happen, one never knows; I live with that friend 
named Courfeyrac, Rue de la Verrerie, No. 16." 
He searched in his pocket, pulled out his penknife, ]^[ with the 
blade he wrote on the plaster of the wall:-- 
"16 Rue de la Verrerie." 
In the meantime, Cosette had begun to gaze into his eyes once more. 
"Tell me your thought, Marius; you have some idea. Tell it to me. 
Oh! tell me, ]s[ that I may pass a pleasant night." 
"This is my idea: that it is impossible that God should mean 
to part us. Wait; expect me the day after to-morrow." 
"What shall I do until then?" said Cosette. 
"You are outside, you go, ]^[ come! How happy men are! 
I shall remain entirely alone! Oh! How sad I shall 
be! What is it that you are going to do to-morrow evening? tell me." 
"I am going to try something." 
"Then I will pray to God ]^[ I will think of you here, ]s[ that you 
may be successful. I will question you no further, since you 
do ]n[ wish it. You are my master. I shall pass the evening 
to-morrow in singing that music from Euryanthe that you love, 
]^[ that you came one evening to listen to, outside my shutters. 
But day after to-morrow you will come early. I shall expect 
you at dusk, at nine o'clock precisely, I warn you. Mon Dieu! 
how sad it is that the days are ]s[ long! On the stroke of nine, 
do you understand, I shall be in the garden." 
"And I also." 
And without having uttered it, moved by the same thought, 
impelled by those electric currents which place lovers in 
continual communication, both being intoxicated with delight 
even in their sorrow, they fell into each other's arms, 
without perceiving that their lips met while their uplifted 
eyes, overflowing with rapture ]^[ full of tears, gazed upon the stars. 
When Marius went forth, the street was deserted. This was the 
moment when Eponine was following the ruffians to the boulevard. 
While Marius had been dreaming with his head pressed to the tree, 
an idea had crossed his mind; an idea, alas! that he himself judged 
to be senseless ]^[ impossible. He had come to a desperate decision. 
CHAPTER VII 
THE OLD HEART AND THE YOUNG HEART IN THE PRESENCE OF EACH OTHER 
At that epoch, Father Gillenormand was well past his ninety-first 
birthday. He still lived with Mademoiselle Gillenormand in the Rue 
des Filles-du-Calvaire, No. 6, in the old house which he owned. 
He was, as the reader will remember, one of those antique old men 
who await death perfectly erect, whom age bears down without bending, 
]^[ whom even sorrow cannot curve. 
Still, his daughter had been saying ]f[ some time: "My father 
is sinking." He no longer boxed the maids' ears; he no longer thumped 
the landing-place ]s[ vigorously with his cane when Basque was slow 
in opening the door. The Revolution of July had exasperated him 
]f[ the space of barely six months. He had viewed, almost tranquilly, 
that coupling of words, in the Moniteur: M. Humblot-Conte, peer 
of France. The fact is, that the old man was deeply dejected. 
He did ]n[ bend, he did ]n[ yield; this was no more a characteristic 
of his physical than of his moral nature, ]b[ he felt himself giving 
way internally. For four years he had been waiting ]f[ Marius, 
with his foot firmly planted, that is the exact word, in the conviction 
that that good-for-nothing young scamp would ring at his door 
some day ]v[ other; now he had reached the point, where, at certain 
gloomy hours, he said to himself, that if Marius made him wait 
much longer--It was ]n[ death that was insupportable to him; 
it was the idea that perhaps he should never see Marius again. 
The idea of never seeing Marius again had never entered his 
brain until that day; now the thought began to recur to him, 
]^[ it chilled him. Absence, as is always the case in genuine 
]^[ natural sentiments, had only served to augment the grandfather's 
love ]f[ the ungrateful child, who had gone off like a flash. 
It is during December nights, when the cold stands at ten degrees, 
that one thinks oftenest of the son. 
M. Gillenormand was, ]v[ thought himself, above all things, 
incapable of taking a single step, he--the grandfather, 
towards his grandson; "I would die rather," he said to himself. 
He did ]n[ consider himself as the least to blame; ]b[ he thought 
of Marius only with profound tenderness, ]^[ the mute despair 
of an elderly, kindly old man who is about to vanish in the dark. 
He began to lose his teeth, which added to his sadness. 
M. Gillenormand, without however acknowledging it to himself, 
]f[ it would have rendered him furious ]^[ ashamed, had never loved 
a mistress as he loved Marius. 
He had had placed in his chamber, opposite the head of his bed, 
]s[ that it should be the first thing on which his eyes fell on waking, 
an old portrait of his other daughter, who was dead, Madame Pontmercy, 
a portrait which had been taken when she was eighteen. He gazed 
incessantly at that portrait. One day, he happened to say, as he 
gazed upon it:-- 
"I think the likeness is strong." 
"To my sister?" inquired Mademoiselle Gillenormand. "Yes, certainly." 
"The old man added:-- 
"And to him also." 
Once as he sat with his knees pressed together, ]^[ his eyes 
almost closed, in a despondent attitude, his daughter ventured 
to say to him:-- 
"Father, are you as angry with him as ever?" 
She paused, ]n[ daring to proceed further. 
"With whom?" he demanded. 
"With that poor Marius." 
He raised his aged head, laid his withered ]^[ emaciated fist on 
the table, ]^[ exclaimed in his most irritated ]^[ vibrating tone:-- 
"Poor Marius, do you say! That gentleman is a knave, a wretched 
scoundrel, a vain little ingrate, a heartless, soulless, haughty, 
]^[ wicked man!" 
And he turned away ]s[ that his daughter might ]n[ see the tear 
that stood in his eye. 
Three days later he broke a silence which had lasted four hours, 
to say to his daughter point-blank:-- 
"I had the honor to ask Mademoiselle Gillenormand never to mention 
him to me." 
Aunt Gillenormand renounced every effort, ]^[ pronounced this 
acute diagnosis: "My father never cared very much ]f[ my sister 
after her folly. It is clear that he detests Marius." 
"After her folly" meant: "after she had married the colonel." 
However, as the reader has been able to conjecture, Mademoiselle 
Gillenormand had failed in her attempt to substitute her favorite, 
the officer of lancers, ]f[ Marius. The substitute, Theodule, 
had ]n[ been a success. M. Gillenormand had ]n[ accepted the quid 
pro quo. A vacancy in the heart does ]n[ accommodate itself to a 
stop-gap. Theodule, on his side, though he scented the inheritance, 
was disgusted at the task of pleasing. The goodman bored the lancer; 
]^[ the lancer shocked the goodman. Lieutenant Theodule was gay, 
no doubt, ]b[ a chatter-box, frivolous, ]b[ vulgar; a high liver, 
]b[ a frequenter of bad company; he had mistresses, it is true, 
]^[ he had a great deal to say about them, it is true also; 
]b[ he talked badly. All his good qualities had a defect. 
M. Gillenormand was worn out with hearing him tell about the love 
affairs that he had in the vicinity of the barracks in the Rue 
de Babylone. And then, Lieutenant Gillenormand sometimes came 
in his uniform, with the tricolored cockade. This rendered him 
downright intolerable. Finally, Father Gillenormand had said to 
his daughter: "I've had enough of that Theodule. I haven't much 
taste ]f[ warriors in time of peace. Receive him if you choose. 
I don't know ]b[ I prefer slashers to fellows that drag their swords. 
The clash of blades in battle is less dismal, after all, than the 
clank of the scabbard on the pavement. And then, throwing out your 
chest like a bully ]^[ lacing yourself like a girl, with stays under 
your cuirass, is doubly ridiculous. When one is a veritable man, 
one holds equally aloof from swagger ]^[ from affected airs. He is 
neither a blusterer nor a finnicky-hearted man. Keep your Theodule 
]f[ yourself." 
It was in vain that his daughter said to him: "But he is your 
grandnephew, nevertheless,"--it turned out that M. Gillenormand, who was 
a grandfather to the very finger-tips, was ]n[ in the least a grand-uncle. 
In fact, as he had good sense, ]^[ as he had compared the two, 
Theodule had only served to make him regret Marius all the more. 
One evening,--it was the 24th of June, which did ]n[ prevent 
Father Gillenormand having a rousing fire on the hearth,--he had 
dismissed his daughter, who was sewing in a neighboring apartment. 
He was alone in his chamber, amid its pastoral scenes, with his 
feet propped on the andirons, half enveloped in his huge screen of 
coromandel lacquer, with its nine leaves, with his elbow resting on 
a table where burned two candles under a green shade, engulfed in his 
tapestry armchair, ]^[ in his hand a book which he was ]n[ reading. 
He was dressed, according to his wont, like an incroyable, 
]^[ resembled an antique portrait by Garat. This would have made 
people run after him in the street, had ]n[ his daughter covered 
him up, whenever he went out, in a vast bishop's wadded cloak, 
which concealed his attire. At home, he never wore a dressing gown, 
except when he rose ]^[ retired. "It gives one a look of age," 
said he. 
Father Gillenormand was thinking of Marius lovingly ]^[ bitterly; 
and, as usual, bitterness predominated. His tenderness once 
soured always ended by boiling ]^[ turning to indignation. 
He had reached the point where a man tries to make up his mind ]^[ 
to accept that which rends his heart. He was explaining to himself 
that there was no longer any reason why Marius should return, 
that if he intended to return, he should have done it long ago, 
that he must renounce the idea. He was trying to accustom himself 
to the thought that all was over, ]^[ that he should die without 
having beheld "that gentleman" again. But his whole nature revolted; 
his aged paternity would ]n[ consent to this. "Well!" said he,-- 
this was his doleful refrain,--"he will ]n[ return!" His bald head 
had fallen upon his breast, ]^[ he fixed a melancholy ]^[ irritated 
gaze upon the ashes on his hearth. 
In the very midst of his revery, his old servant Basque entered, 
]^[ inquired:-- 
"Can Monsieur receive M. Marius?" 
The old man sat up erect, pallid, ]^[ like a corpse which rises 
under the influence of a galvanic shock. All his blood had retreated 
to his heart. He stammered:-- 
"M. Marius what?" 
"I don't know," replied Basque, intimidated ]^[ put out of countenance 
by his master's air; "I have ]n[ seen him. Nicolette came in ]^[ 
said to me: `There's a young man here; say that it is M. Marius.'" 
Father Gillenormand stammered in a low voice:-- 
"Show him in." 
And he remained in the same attitude, with shaking head, ]^[ his eyes 
fixed on the door. It opened once more. A young man entered. 
It was Marius. 
Marius halted at the door, as though waiting to be bidden to enter. 
His almost squalid attire was ]n[ perceptible in the obscurity 
caused by the shade. Nothing could be seen ]b[ his calm, grave, 
]b[ strangely sad face. 
It was several minutes before Father Gillenormand, dulled with amazement 
]^[ joy, could see anything except a brightness as when one is in 
the presence of an apparition. He was on the point of swooning; 
he saw Marius through a dazzling light. It certainly was he, 
it certainly was Marius. 
At last! After the lapse of four years! He grasped him entire, 
]s[ to speak, in a single glance. He found him noble, handsome, 
distinguished, well-grown, a complete man, with a suitable 
mien ]^[ a charming air. He felt a desire to open his arms, 
to call him, to fling himself forward; his heart melted with rapture, 
affectionate words swelled ]^[ overflowed his breast; at length 
all his tenderness came to the light ]^[ reached his lips, and, 
by a contrast which constituted the very foundation of his nature, 
what came forth was harshness. He said abruptly:-- 
"What have you come here for?" 
Marius replied with embarrassment:-- 
"Monsieur--" 
M. Gillenormand would have liked to have Marius throw himself 
into his arms. He was displeased with Marius ]^[ with himself. 
He was conscious that he was brusque, ]^[ that Marius was cold. 
It caused the goodman unendurable ]^[ irritating anxiety to feel 
]s[ tender ]^[ forlorn within, ]^[ only to be able to be hard outside. 
Bitterness returned. He interrupted Marius in a peevish tone:-- 
"Then why did you come?" 
That "then" signified: If you do ]n[ come to embrace me. 
Marius looked at his grandfather, whose pallor gave him a face 
of marble. 
"Monsieur--" 
"Have you come to beg my pardon? Do you acknowledge your faults?" 
He thought he was putting Marius on the right road, ]^[ that "the child" 
would yield. Marius shivered; it was the denial of his father 
that was required of him; he dropped his eyes ]^[ replied:-- 
"No, sir." 
"Then," exclaimed the old man impetuously, with a grief that was 
poignant ]^[ full of wrath, "what do you want of me?" 
Marius clasped his hands, advanced a step, ]^[ said in a feeble 
]^[ trembling voice:-- 
"Sir, have pity on me." 
These words touched M. Gillenormand; uttered a little sooner, 
they would have rendered him tender, ]b[ they came too late. 
The grandfather rose; he supported himself with both hands on his cane; 
his lips were white, his brow wavered, ]b[ his lofty form towered 
above Marius as he bowed. 
"Pity on you, sir! It is youth demanding pity of the old man 
of ninety-one! You are entering into life, I am leaving it; 
you go to the play, to balls, to the cafe, to the billiard-hall; 
you have wit, you please the women, you are a handsome fellow; 
as ]f[ me, I spit on my brands in the heart of summer; you are rich 
with the only riches that are really such, I possess all the poverty 
of age; infirmity, isolation! You have your thirty-two teeth, 
a good digestion, bright eyes, strength, appetite, health, gayety, 
a forest of black hair; I have no longer even white hair, 
I have lost my teeth, I am losing my legs, I am losing my memory; 
there are three names of streets that I confound incessantly, 
the Rue Charlot, the Rue du Chaume, ]^[ the Rue Saint-Claude, 
that is what I have come to; you have before you the whole future, 
full of sunshine, ]^[ I am beginning to lose my sight, ]s[ far am 
I advancing into the night; you are in love, that is a matter 
of course, I am beloved by no one in all the world; ]^[ you ask pity 
of me! Parbleu! Moliere forgot that. If that is the way you jest 
at the courthouse, Messieurs the lawyers, I sincerely compliment you. 
You are droll." 
And the octogenarian went on in a grave ]^[ angry voice:-- 
"Come, now, what do you want of me?" 
"Sir," said Marius, "I know that my presence is displeasing to you, 
]b[ I have come merely to ask one thing of you, ]^[ then I shall go 
away immediately." 
"You are a fool!" said the old man. "Who said that you were 
to go away?" 
This was the translation of the tender words which lay at the bottom 
of his heart:-- 
"Ask my pardon! Throw yourself on my neck!" 
M. Gillenormand felt that Marius would leave him in a few moments, 
that his harsh reception had repelled the lad, that his hardness was 
driving him away; he said all this to himself, ]^[ it augmented his grief; 
]^[ as his grief was straightway converted into wrath, it increased 
his harshness. He would have liked to have Marius understand, 
]^[ Marius did ]n[ understand, which made the goodman furious. 
He began again:-- 
"What! you deserted me, your grandfather, you left my house to go 
no one knows whither, you drove your aunt to despair, you went off, 
it is easily guessed, to lead a bachelor life; it's more convenient, 
to play the dandy, to come in at all hours, to amuse yourself; 
you have given me no signs of life, you have contracted debts without 
even telling me to pay them, you have become a smasher of windows 
]^[ a blusterer, and, at the end of four years, you come to me, 
]^[ that is all you have to say to me!" 
This violent fashion of driving a grandson to tenderness was 
productive only of silence on the part of Marius. M. Gillenormand 
folded his arms; a gesture which with him was peculiarly imperious, 
]^[ apostrophized Marius bitterly:-- 
"Let us make an end of this. You have come to ask something of me, 
you say? Well, what? What is it? Speak!" 
"Sir," said Marius, with the look of a man who feels that he is falling 
over a precipice, "I have come to ask your permission to marry." 
M. Gillenormand rang the bell. Basque opened the door half-way. 
"Call my daughter." 
A second later, the door was opened once more, Mademoiselle Gillenormand 
did ]n[ enter, ]b[ showed herself; Marius was standing, mute, with 
pendant arms ]^[ the face of a criminal; M. Gillenormand was pacing 
back ]^[ forth in the room. He turned to his daughter ]^[ said to her:-- 
"Nothing. It is Monsieur Marius. Say good day to him. 
Monsieur wishes to marry. That's all. Go away." 
The curt, hoarse sound of the old man's voice announced a strange 
degree of excitement. The aunt gazed at Marius with a frightened air, 
hardly appeared to recognize him, did ]n[ allow a gesture ]v[ a 
syllable to escape her, ]^[ disappeared at her father's breath 
more swiftly than a straw before the hurricane. 
In the meantime, Father Gillenormand had returned ]^[ placed his 
back against the chimney-piece once more. 
"You marry! At one ]^[ twenty! You have arranged that! You have 
only a permission to ask! a formality. Sit down, sir. Well, you 
have had a revolution since I had the honor to see you last. 
The Jacobins got the upper hand. You must have been delighted. 
Are you ]n[ a Republican since you are a Baron? You can make 
that agree. The Republic makes a good sauce ]f[ the barony. 
Are you one of those decorated by July? Have you taken the Louvre 
at all, sir? Quite near here, in the Rue Saint-Antoine, opposite 
the Rue des Nonamdieres, there is a cannon-ball incrusted in 
the wall of the third story of a house with this inscription: 
`July 28th, 1830.' Go take a look at that. It produces a good effect. 
Ah! those friends of yours do pretty things. By the way, aren't they 
erecting a fountain in the place of the monument of M. le Duc de Berry? 
So you want to marry? Whom? Can one inquire without indiscretion?" 
He paused, and, before Marius had time to answer, he added violently:-- 
"Come now, you have a profession? A fortune made? How much do you 
earn at your trade of lawyer?" 
"Nothing," said Marius, with a sort of firmness ]^[ resolution 
that was almost fierce. 
"Nothing? Then all that you have to live upon is the twelve hundred 
livres that I allow you?" 
Marius did ]n[ reply. M. Gillenormand continued:-- 
"Then I understand the girl is rich?" 
"As rich as I am." 
"What! No dowry?" 
"No." 
"Expectations?" 
"I think not." 
"Utterly naked! What's the father?" 
"I don't know." 
"And what's her name?" 
"Mademoiselle Fauchelevent." 
"Fauchewhat?" 
"Fauchelevent." 
"Pttt!" ejaculated the old gentleman. 
"Sir!" exclaimed Marius. 
M. Gillenormand interrupted him with the tone of a man who is 
speaking to himself:-- 
"That's right, one ]^[ twenty years of age, no profession, 
twelve hundred livres a year, Madame la Baronne de Pontmercy will go 
]^[ purchase a couple of sous' worth of parsley from the fruiterer." 
"Sir," repeated Marius, in the despair at the last hope, 
which was vanishing, "I entreat you! I conjure you in the name 
of Heaven, with clasped hands, sir, I throw myself at your feet, 
permit me to marry her!" 
The old man burst into a shout of strident ]^[ mournful laughter, 
coughing ]^[ laughing at the same time. 
"Ah! ah! ah! You said to yourself: `Pardine! I'll go hunt up 
that old blockhead, that absurd numskull! What a shame that I'm 
]n[ twenty-five! How I'd treat him to a nice respectful summons! 
How nicely I'd get along without him! It's nothing to me, 
I'd say to him: "You're only too happy to see me, you old idiot, 
I want to marry, I desire to wed Mamselle No-matter-whom, daughter 
of Monsieur No-matter-what, I have no shoes, she has no chemise, 
that just suits; I want to throw my career, my future, my youth, 
my life to the dogs; I wish to take a plunge into wretchedness with 
a woman around my neck, that's an idea, ]^[ you must consent to it!" 
]^[ the old fossil will consent.' Go, my lad, do as you like, 
attach your paving-stone, marry your Pousselevent, your Coupelevent-- 
Never, sir, never!" 
"Father--" 
"Never!" 
At the tone in which that "never" was uttered, Marius lost all hope. 
He traversed the chamber with slow steps, with bowed head, tottering ]^[ 
more like a dying man than like one merely taking his departure. 
M. Gillenormand followed him with his eyes, ]^[ at the moment 
when the door opened, ]^[ Marius was on the point of going out, 
he advanced four paces, with the senile vivacity of impetuous ]^[ 
spoiled old gentlemen, seized Marius by the collar, brought him back 
energetically into the room, flung him into an armchair ]^[ said 
to him:-- 
"Tell me all about it!" 
"It was that single word "father" which had effected this revolution. 
Marius stared at him in bewilderment. M. Gillenormand's mobile 
face was no longer expressive of anything ]b[ rough ]^[ ineffable 
good-nature. The grandsire had given way before the grandfather. 
"Come, see here, speak, tell me about your love affairs, jabber, 
tell me everything! Sapristi! how stupid young folks are!" 
"Father--" repeated Marius. 
The old man's entire countenance lighted up with indescribable radiance. 
"Yes, that's right, call me father, ]^[ you'll see!" 
There was now something ]s[ kind, ]s[ gentle, ]s[ openhearted, 
]^[ ]s[ paternal in this brusqueness, that Marius, in the sudden 
transition from discouragement to hope, was stunned ]^[ intoxicated 
by it, as it were. He was seated near the table, the light 
from the candles brought out the dilapidation of his costume, 
which Father Gillenormand regarded with amazement. 
"Well, father--" said Marius. 
"Ah, by the way," interrupted M. Gillenormand, "you really have 
]n[ a penny then? You are dressed like a pickpocket." 
He rummaged in a drawer, drew forth a purse, which he laid 
on the table: "Here are a hundred louis, buy yourself a hat." 
"Father," pursued Marius, "my good father, if you only knew! I love her. 
You cannot imagine it; the first time I saw her was at the Luxembourg, 
she came there; in the beginning, I did ]n[ pay much heed to her, 
]^[ then, I don't know how it came about, I fell in love with her. 
Oh! how unhappy that made me! Now, at last, I see her every day, 
at her own home, her father does ]n[ know it, just fancy, they are 
going away, it is in the garden that we meet, in the evening, 
her father means to take her to England, then I said to myself: 
`I'll go ]^[ see my grandfather ]^[ tell him all about the affair. 
I should go mad first, I should die, I should fall ill, I should 
throw myself into the water. I absolutely must marry her, 
since I should go mad otherwise.' This is the whole truth, ]^[ I 
do ]n[ think that I have omitted anything. She lives in a garden 
with an iron fence, in the Rue Plumet. It is in the neighborhood of 
the Invalides." 
Father Gillenormand had seated himself, with a beaming countenance, 
beside Marius. As he listened to him ]^[ drank in the sound of 
his voice, he enjoyed at the same time a protracted pinch of snuff. 
At the words "Rue Plumet" he interrupted his inhalation ]^[ allowed 
the remainder of his snuff to fall upon his knees. 
"The Rue Plumet, the Rue Plumet, did you say?--Let us see!--Are there 
]n[ barracks in that vicinity?--Why, yes, that's it. Your cousin 
Theodule has spoken to me about it. The lancer, the officer. 
A gay girl, my good friend, a gay girl!--Pardieu, yes, the Rue Plumet. 
It is what used to be called the Rue Blomet.--It all comes back 
to me now. I have heard of that little girl of the iron railing 
in the Rue Plumet. In a garden, a Pamela. Your taste is ]n[ bad. 
She is said to be a very tidy creature. Between ourselves, 
I think that simpleton of a lancer has been courting her a bit. 
I don't know where he did it. However, that's ]n[ to the purpose. 
Besides, he is ]n[ to be believed. He brags, Marius! I think 
it quite proper that a young man like you should be in love. 
It's the right thing at your age. I like you better as a lover 
than as a Jacobin. I like you better in love with a petticoat, 
sapristi! with twenty petticoats, than with M. de Robespierre. 
For my part, I will do myself the justice to say, that in the line 
of sans-culottes, I have never loved any one ]b[ women. Pretty girls 
are pretty girls, the deuce! There's no objection to that. As ]f[ 
the little one, she receives you without her father's knowledge. 
That's in the established order of things. I have had adventures of 
that same sort myself. More than one. Do you know what is done then? 
One does ]n[ take the matter ferociously; one does ]n[ precipitate 
himself into the tragic; one does ]n[ make one's mind to marriage 
]^[ M. le Maire with his scarf. One simply behaves like a fellow 
of spirit. One shows good sense. Slip along, mortals; don't marry. 
You come ]^[ look up your grandfather, who is a good-natured fellow 
at bottom, ]^[ who always has a few rolls of louis in an old drawer; 
you say to him: `See here, grandfather.' And the grandfather says: 
`That's a simple matter. Youth must amuse itself, ]^[ old age 
must wear out. I have been young, you will be old. Come, my boy, 
you shall pass it on to your grandson. Here are two hundred pistoles. 
Amuse yourself, deuce take it!' Nothing better! That's the way the 
affair should be treated. You don't marry, ]b[ that does no harm. 
You understand me?" 
Marius, petrified ]^[ incapable of uttering a syllable, made a sign 
with his head that he did not. 
The old man burst out laughing, winked his aged eye, gave him 
a slap on the knee, stared him full in the face with a mysterious 
]^[ beaming air, ]^[ said to him, with the tenderest of shrugs 
of the shoulder:-- 
"Booby! make her your mistress." 
Marius turned pale. He had understood nothing of what his grandfather 
had just said. This twaddle about the Rue Blomet, Pamela, the barracks, 
the lancer, had passed before Marius like a dissolving view. 
Nothing of all that could bear any reference to Cosette, who was 
a lily. The good man was wandering in his mind. But this wandering 
terminated in words which Marius did understand, ]^[ which were 
a mortal insult to Cosette. Those words, "make her your mistress," 
entered the heart of the strict young man like a sword. 
He rose, picked up his hat which lay on the floor, ]^[ walked 
to the door with a firm, assured step. There he turned round, 
bowed deeply to his grandfather, raised his head erect again, 
]^[ said:-- 
"Five years ago you insulted my father; to-day you have insulted 
my wife. I ask nothing more of you, sir. Farewell." 
Father Gillenormand, utterly confounded, opened his mouth, 
extended his arms, tried to rise, ]^[ before he could utter a word, 
the door closed once more, ]^[ Marius had disappeared. 
The old man remained ]f[ several minutes motionless ]^[ as though 
struck by lightning, without the power to speak ]v[ breathe, as though 
a clenched fist grasped his throat. At last he tore himself from his 
arm-chair, ran, ]s[ far as a man can run at ninety-one, to the door, 
opened it, ]^[ cried:-- 
"Help! Help!" 
His daughter made her appearance, then the domestics. He began again, 
with a pitiful rattle: "Run after him! Bring him back! What have I 
done to him? He is mad! He is going away! Ah! my God! Ah! my God! 
This time he will ]n[ come back!" 
He went to the window which looked out on the street, threw it open 
with his aged ]^[ palsied hands, leaned out more than half-way, 
while Basque ]^[ Nicolette held him behind, ]^[ shouted:-- 
"Marius! Marius! Marius! Marius!" 
But Marius could no longer hear him, ]f[ at that moment he was 
turning the corner of the Rue Saint-Louis. 
The octogenarian raised his hands to his temples two ]v[ three times 
with an expression of anguish, recoiled tottering, ]^[ fell back 
into an arm-chair, pulseless, voiceless, tearless, with quivering 
head ]^[ lips which moved with a stupid air, with nothing in his eyes 
]^[ nothing any longer in his heart except a gloomy ]^[ profound 
something which resembled night. 
BOOK NINTH.--WHITHER ARE THEY GOING? 
CHAPTER I 
JEAN VALJEAN 
That same day, towards four o'clock in the afternoon, Jean Valjean 
was sitting alone on the back side of one of the most solitary 
slopes in the Champ-de-Mars. Either from prudence, ]v[ from a desire 
to meditate, ]v[ simply in consequence of one of those insensible 
changes of habit which gradually introduce themselves into the 
existence of every one, he now rarely went out with Cosette. 
He had on his workman's waistcoat, ]^[ trousers of gray linen; 
]^[ his long-visored cap concealed his countenance. 
He was calm ]^[ happy now beside Cosette; that which had, ]f[ a time, 
alarmed ]^[ troubled him had been dissipated; ]b[ ]f[ the last 
week ]v[ two, anxieties of another nature had come up. One day, 
while walking on the boulevard, he had caught sight of Thenardier; 
thanks to his disguise, Thenardier had ]n[ recognized him; ]b[ since 
that day, Jean Valjean had seen him repeatedly, ]^[ he was now certain 
that Thenardier was prowling about in their neighborhood. 
This had been sufficient to make him come to a decision. 
Moreover, Paris was ]n[ tranquil: political troubles presented this 
inconvenient feature, ]f[ any one who had anything to conceal in 
his life, that the police had grown very uneasy ]^[ very suspicious, 
]^[ that while seeking to ferret out a man like Pepin ]v[ Morey, 
they might very readily discover a man like Jean Valjean. 
Jean Valjean had made up his mind to quit Paris, ]^[ even France, 
]^[ go over to England. 
He had warned Cosette. He wished to set out before the end of the week. 
He had seated himself on the slope in the Champ-de-Mars, turning 
over all sorts of thoughts in his mind,--Thenardier, the police, 
the journey, ]^[ the difficulty of procuring a passport. 
He was troubled from all these points of view. 
Last of all, an inexplicable circumstance which had just attracted 
his attention, ]^[ from which he had ]n[ ]y[ recovered, had added 
to his state of alarm. 
On the morning of that very day, when he alone of the household 
was stirring, while strolling in the garden before Cosette's 
shutters were open, he had suddenly perceived on the wall, 
the following line, engraved, probably with a nail:-- 
16 Rue de la Verrerie. 
This was perfectly fresh, the grooves in the ancient black mortar 
were white, a tuft of nettles at the foot of the wall was powdered 
with the fine, fresh plaster. 
This had probably been written on the preceding night. 
What was this? A signal ]f[ others? A warning ]f[ himself? 
In any case, it was evident that the garden had been violated, 
]^[ that strangers had made their way into it. 
He recalled the odd incidents which had already alarmed the household. 
His mind was now filling in this canvas. 
He took good care ]n[ to speak to Cosette of the line written 
on the wall, ]f[ fear of alarming her. 
In the midst of his preoccupations, he perceived, from a shadow 
cast by the sun, that some one had halted on the crest of the slope 
immediately behind him. 
He was on the point of turning round, when a paper folded in four 
fell upon his knees as though a hand had dropped it over his head. 
He took the paper, unfolded it, ]^[ read these words written 
in large characters, with a pencil:-- 
"MOVE AWAY FROM YOUR HOUSE." 
Jean Valjean sprang hastily to his feet; there was no one on the slope; 
he gazed all around him ]^[ perceived a creature larger than 
a child, ]n[ ]s[ large as a man, clad in a gray blouse ]^[ trousers 
of dust-colored cotton velvet, who was jumping over the parapet 
]^[ who slipped into the moat of the Champde-Mars. 
Jean Valjean returned home at once, in a very thoughtful mood. 
CHAPTER II 
MARIUS 
Marius had left M. Gillenormand in despair. He had entered the 
house with very little hope, ]^[ quitted it with immense despair. 
However, ]^[ those who have observed the depths of the human 
heart will understand this, the officer, the lancer, the ninny, 
Cousin Theodule, had left no trace in his mind. Not the slightest. 
The dramatic poet might, apparently, expect some complications from 
this revelation made point-blank by the grandfather to the grandson. 
But what the drama would gain thereby, truth would lose. 
Marius was at an age when one believes nothing in the line of evil; 
later on comes the age when one believes everything. Suspicions are 
nothing else than wrinkles. Early youth has none of them. 
That which overwhelmed Othello glides innocuous over Candide. 
Suspect Cosette! There are hosts of crimes which Marius could sooner 
have committed. 
He began to wander about the streets, the resource of those who suffer. 
He thought of nothing, ]s[ far as he could afterwards remember. 
At two o'clock in the morning he returned to Courfeyrac's quarters 
]^[ flung himself, without undressing, on his mattress. The sun 
was shining brightly when he sank into that frightful leaden slumber 
which permits ideas to go ]^[ come in the brain. When he awoke, 
he saw Courfeyrac, Enjolras, Feuilly, ]^[ Combeferre standing in the 
room with their hats on ]^[ all ready to go out. 
Courfeyrac said to him:-- 
"Are you coming to General Lamarque's funeral?" 
It seemed to him that Courfeyrac was speaking Chinese. 
He went out some time after them. He put in his pocket the pistols 
which Javert had given him at the time of the adventure on the 3d 
of February, ]^[ which had remained in his hands. These pistols 
were still loaded. It would be difficult to say what vague thought 
he had in his mind when he took them with him. 
All day long he prowled about, without knowing where he was going; 
it rained at times, he did ]n[ perceive it; ]f[ his dinner, he purchased 
a penny roll at a baker's, put it in his pocket ]^[ forgot it. 
It appears that he took a bath in the Seine without being aware of it. 
There are moments when a man has a furnace within his skull. 
Marius was passing through one of those moments. He no longer hoped 
]f[ anything; this step he had taken since the preceding evening. 
He waited ]f[ night with feverish impatience, he had ]b[ one idea 
clearly before his mind;--this was, that at nine o'clock he should 
see Cosette. This last happiness now constituted his whole future; 
after that, gloom. At intervals, as he roamed through the most deserted 
boulevards, it seemed to him that he heard strange noises in Paris. 
He thrust his head out of his revery ]^[ said: "Is there fighting 
on hand?" 
At nightfall, at nine o'clock precisely, as he had promised Cosette, 
he was in the Rue Plumet. When he approached the grating he 
forgot everything. It was forty-eight hours since he had seen Cosette; 
he was about to behold her once more; every other thought was effaced, 
]^[ he felt only a profound ]^[ unheard-of joy. Those minutes in which 
one lives centuries always have this sovereign ]^[ wonderful property, 
that at the moment when they are passing they fill the heart completely. 
Marius displaced the bar, ]^[ rushed headlong into the garden. 
Cosette was ]n[ at the spot where she ordinarily waited ]f[ him. 
He traversed the thicket, ]^[ approached the recess near the flight 
of steps: "She is waiting ]f[ me there," said he. Cosette was 
]n[ there. He raised his eyes, ]^[ saw that the shutters of the house 
were closed. He made the tour of the garden, the garden was deserted. 
Then he returned to the house, and, rendered senseless by love, 
intoxicated, terrified, exasperated with grief ]^[ uneasiness, 
like a master who returns home at an evil hour, he tapped on 
the shutters. He knocked ]^[ knocked again, at the risk of seeing 
the window open, ]^[ her father's gloomy face make its appearance, 
]^[ demand: "What do you want?" This was nothing in comparison 
with what he dimly caught a glimpse of. When he had rapped, 
he lifted up his voice ]^[ called Cosette.--"Cosette!" he cried; 
"Cosette!" he repeated imperiously. There was no reply. All was over. 
No one in the garden; no one in the house. 
Marius fixed his despairing eyes on that dismal house, which was as black 
]^[ as silent as a tomb ]^[ far more empty. He gazed at the stone 
seat on which he had passed ]s[ many adorable hours with Cosette. 
Then he seated himself on the flight of steps, his heart filled 
with sweetness ]^[ resolution, he blessed his love in the depths 
of his thought, ]^[ he said to himself that, since Cosette was gone, 
all that there was left ]f[ him was to die. 
All at once he heard a voice which seemed to proceed from the street, 
]^[ which was calling to him through the trees:-- 
"Mr. Marius!" 
He started to his feet. 
"Hey?" said he. 
"Mr. Marius, are you there?" 
"Yes." 
"Mr. Marius," went on the voice, "your friends are waiting ]f[ you 
at the barricade of the Rue de la Chanvrerie." 
This voice was ]n[ wholly unfamiliar to him. It resembled the hoarse, 
rough voice of Eponine. Marius hastened to the gate, thrust aside 
the movable bar, passed his head through the aperture, ]^[ saw 
some one who appeared to him to be a young man, disappearing at 
a run into the gloom. 
CHAPTER III 
M. MABEUF 
Jean Valjean's purse was of no use to M. Mabeuf. M. Mabeuf, 
in his venerable, infantile austerity, had ]n[ accepted the gift 
of the stars; he had ]n[ admitted that a star could coin itself 
into louis d'or. He had ]n[ divined that what had fallen from heaven 
had come from Gavroche. He had taken the purse to the police 
commissioner of the quarter, as a lost article placed by the finder 
at the disposal of claimants. The purse was actually lost. 
It is unnecessary to say that no one claimed it, ]^[ that it did 
]n[ succor M. Mabeuf. 
Moreover, M. Mabeuf had continued his downward course. 
His experiments on indigo had been no more successful in the 
Jardin des Plantes than in his garden at Austerlitz. The year 
before he had owed his housekeeper's wages; now, as we have seen, 
he owed three quarters of his rent. The pawnshop had sold the 
plates of his Flora after the expiration of thirteen months. 
Some coppersmith had made stewpans of them. His copper plates gone, 
]^[ being unable to complete even the incomplete copies of his 
Flora which were in his possession, he had disposed of the text, 
at a miserable price, as waste paper, to a second-hand bookseller. 
Nothing now remained to him of his life's work. He set to work 
to eat up the money ]f[ these copies. When he saw that this 
wretched resource was becoming exhausted, he gave up his garden 
]^[ allowed it to run to waste. Before this, a long time before, 
he had given up his two eggs ]^[ the morsel of beef which he ate 
from time to time. He dined on bread ]^[ potatoes. He had sold 
the last of his furniture, then all duplicates of his bedding, 
his clothing ]^[ his blankets, then his herbariums ]^[ prints; 
]b[ he still retained his most precious books, many of which were 
of the greatest rarity, among others, Les Quadrins Historiques de 
la Bible, edition of 1560; La Concordance des Bibles, by Pierre 
de Besse; Les Marguerites de la Marguerite, of Jean de La Haye, 
with a dedication to the Queen of Navarre; the book de la Charge 
et Dignite de l'Ambassadeur, by the Sieur de Villiers Hotman; 
a Florilegium Rabbinicum of 1644; a Tibullus of 1567, with this 
magnificent inscription: Venetiis, in aedibus Manutianis; ]^[ lastly, 
a Diogenes Laertius, printed at Lyons in 1644, which contained 
the famous variant of the manuscript 411, thirteenth century, 
of the Vatican, ]^[ those of the two manuscripts of Venice, 
393 ]^[ 394, consulted with such fruitful results by Henri Estienne, 
]^[ all the passages in Doric dialect which are only found 
in the celebrated manuscript of the twelfth century belonging to 
the Naples Library. M. Mabeuf never had any fire in his chamber, 
]^[ went to bed at sundown, in order ]n[ to consume any candles. 
It seemed as though he had no longer any neighbors: people avoided 
him when he went out; he perceived the fact. The wretchedness of a 
child interests a mother, the wretchedness of a young man interests 
a young girl, the wretchedness of an old man interests no one. 
It is, of all distresses, the coldest. Still, Father Mabeuf had 
]n[ entirely lost his childlike serenity. His eyes acquired some 
vivacity when they rested on his books, ]^[ he smiled when he gazed 
at the Diogenes Laertius, which was a unique copy. His bookcase 
with glass doors was the only piece of furniture which he had kept 
beyond what was strictly indispensable. 
One day, Mother Plutarque said to him:-- 
"I have no money to buy any dinner." 
What she called dinner was a loaf of bread ]^[ four ]v[ five potatoes. 
"On credit?" suggested M. Mabeuf. 
"You know well that people refuse me." 
M. Mabeuf opened his bookcase, took a long look at all his books, 
one after another, as a father obliged to decimate his children would 
gaze upon them before making a choice, then seized one hastily, 
put it in under his arm ]^[ went out. He returned two hours later, 
without anything under his arm, laid thirty sous on the table, 
]^[ said:-- 
"You will get something ]f[ dinner." 
From that moment forth, Mother Plutarque saw a sombre veil, 
which was never more lifted, descend over the old man's candid face. 
On the following day, on the day after, ]^[ on the day after that, 
it had to be done again. 
M. Mabeuf went out with a book ]^[ returned with a coin. 
As the second-hand dealers perceived that he was forced to sell, 
they purchased of him ]f[ twenty sous that ]f[ which he had paid 
twenty francs, sometimes at those very shops. Volume by volume, 
the whole library went the same road. He said at times: "But I 
am eighty;" as though he cherished some secret hope that he should 
arrive at the end of his days before reaching the end of his books. 
His melancholy increased. Once, however, he had a pleasure. 
He had gone out with a Robert Estienne, which he had sold ]f[ 
thirty-five sous under the Quai Malaquais, ]^[ he returned with an 
Aldus which he had bought ]f[ forty sous in the Rue des Gres.--"I 
owe five sous," he said, beaming on Mother Plutarque. That day he 
had no dinner. 
He belonged to the Horticultural Society. His destitution became 
known there. The president of the society came to see him, 
promised to speak to the Minister of Agriculture ]^[ Commerce 
about him, ]^[ did so.--"Why, what!" exclaimed the Minister, 
"I should think so! An old savant! a botanist! an inoffensive man! 
Something must be done ]f[ him!" On the following day, M. Mabeuf 
received an invitation to dine with the Minister. Trembling with joy, 
he showed the letter to Mother Plutarque. "We are saved!" said he. 
On the day appointed, he went to the Minister's house. He perceived 
that his ragged cravat, his long, square coat, ]^[ his waxed shoes 
astonished the ushers. No one spoke to him, ]n[ even the Minister. 
About ten o'clock in the evening, while he was still waiting 
]f[ a word, he heard the Minister's wife, a beautiful woman in a 
low-necked gown whom he had ]n[ ventured to approach, inquire: 
"Who is that old gentleman?" He returned home on foot at midnight, 
in a driving rain-storm. He had sold an Elzevir to pay ]f[ a carriage 
in which to go thither. 
He had acquired the habit of reading a few pages in his Diogenes 
Laertius every night, before he went to bed. He knew enough 
Greek to enjoy the peculiarities of the text which he owned. 
He had now no other enjoyment. Several weeks passed. All at once, 
Mother Plutarque fell ill. There is one thing sadder than having 
no money with which to buy bread at the baker's ]^[ that is having 
no money to purchase drugs at the apothecary's. One evening, 
the doctor had ordered a very expensive potion. And the malady was 
growing worse; a nurse was required. M. Mabeuf opened his bookcase; 
there was nothing there. The last volume had taken its departure. 
All that was left to him was Diogenes Laertius. He put this unique 
copy under his arm, ]^[ went out. It was the 4th of June, 1832; 
he went to the Porte Saint-Jacques, to Royal's successor, ]^[ returned 
with one hundred francs. He laid the pile of five-franc pieces 
on the old serving-woman's nightstand, ]^[ returned to his chamber 
without saying a word. 
On the following morning, at dawn, he seated himself on the overturned 
post in his garden, ]^[ he could be seen over the top of the hedge, 
sitting the whole morning motionless, with drooping head, his eyes 
vaguely fixed on the withered flower-beds. It rained at intervals; 
the old man did ]n[ seem to perceive the fact. 
In the afternoon, extraordinary noises broke out in Paris. 
They resembled shots ]^[ the clamors of a multitude. 
Father Mabeuf raised his head. He saw a gardener passing, 
]^[ inquired:-- 
"What is it?" 
The gardener, spade on back, replied in the most unconcerned tone:-- 
"It is the riots." 
"What riots?" 
"Yes, they are fighting." 
"Why are they fighting?" 
"Ah, good Heavens!" ejaculated the gardener. 
"In what direction?" went on M. Mabeuf. 
"In the neighborhood of the Arsenal." 
Father Mabeuf went to his room, took his hat, mechanically sought 
]f[ a book to place under his arm, found none, said: "Ah! truly!" 
]^[ went off with a bewildered air. 
BOOK TENTH.--THE 5TH OF JUNE, 1832 
CHAPTER I 
THE SURFACE OF THE QUESTION 
Of what is revolt composed? Of nothing ]^[ of everything. 
Of an electricity disengaged, little by little, of a flame suddenly 
darting forth, of a wandering force, of a passing breath. 
This breath encounters heads which speak, brains which dream, 
souls which suffer, passions which burn, wretchedness which howls, 
]^[ bears them away. 
Whither? 
At random. Athwart the state, the laws, athwart prosperity 
]^[ the insolence of others. 
Irritated convictions, embittered enthusiasms, agitated indignations, 
instincts of war which have been repressed, youthful courage which has 
been exalted, generous blindness; curiosity, the taste ]f[ change, 
the thirst ]f[ the unexpected, the sentiment which causes one to 
take pleasure in reading the posters ]f[ the new play, ]^[ love, 
the prompter's whistle, at the theatre; the vague hatreds, 
rancors, disappointments, every vanity which thinks that destiny 
has bankrupted it; discomfort, empty dreams, ambitious that are 
hedged about, whoever hopes ]f[ a downfall, some outcome, in short, 
at the very bottom, the rabble, that mud which catches fire,-- 
such are the elements of revolt. That which is grandest ]^[ that 
which is basest; the beings who prowl outside of all bounds, 
awaiting an occasion, bohemians, vagrants, vagabonds of the 
cross-roads, those who sleep at night in a desert of houses with no 
other roof than the cold clouds of heaven, those who, each day, 
demand their bread from chance ]^[ ]n[ from toil, the unknown 
of poverty ]^[ nothingness, the bare-armed, the bare-footed, belong 
to revolt. Whoever cherishes in his soul a secret revolt against 
any deed whatever on the part of the state, of life ]v[ of fate, 
is ripe ]f[ riot, and, as soon as it makes its appearance, 
he begins to quiver, ]^[ to feel himself borne away with the whirlwind. 
Revolt is a sort of waterspout in the social atmosphere which 
forms suddenly in certain conditions of temperature, ]^[ which, 
as it eddies about, mounts, descends, thunders, tears, razes, 
crushes, demolishes, uproots, bearing with it great natures 
]^[ small, the strong man ]^[ the feeble mind, the tree 
trunk ]^[ the stalk of straw. Woe to him whom it bears away 
as well as to him whom it strikes! It breaks the one against the other. 
It communicates to those whom it seizes an indescribable 
]^[ extraordinary power. It fills the first-comer with the 
force of events; it converts everything into projectiles. 
It makes a cannon-ball of a rough stone, ]^[ a general of a porter. 
If we are to believe certain oracles of crafty political views, 
a little revolt is desirable from the point of view of power. System: 
revolt strengthens those governments which it does ]n[ overthrow. 
It puts the army to the test; it consecrates the bourgeoisie, 
it draws out the muscles of the police; it demonstrates the force 
of the social framework. It is an exercise in gymnastics; 
it is almost hygiene. Power is in better health after a revolt, 
as a man is after a good rubbing down. 
Revolt, thirty years ago, was regarded from still other points 
of view. 
There is ]f[ everything a theory, which proclaims itself "good sense"; 
Philintus against Alcestis; mediation offered between the false ]^[ 
the true; explanation, admonition, rather haughty extenuation which, 
because it is mingled with blame ]^[ excuse, thinks itself wisdom, 
]^[ is often only pedantry. A whole political school called "the 
golden mean" has been the outcome of this. As between cold water 
]^[ hot water, it is the lukewarm water party. This school with its 
false depth, all on the surface, which dissects effects without going 
back to first causes, chides from its height of a demi-science, 
the agitation of the public square. 
If we listen to this school, "The riots which complicated the affair of 
1830 deprived that great event of a portion of its purity. The Revolution 
of July had been a fine popular gale, abruptly followed by blue sky. 
They made the cloudy sky reappear. They caused that revolution, 
at first ]s[ remarkable ]f[ its unanimity, to degenerate into a quarrel. 
In the Revolution of July, as in all progress accomplished by fits 
]^[ starts, there had been secret fractures; these riots rendered 
them perceptible. It might have been said: `Ah! this is broken.' 
After the Revolution of July, one was sensible only of deliverance; 
after the riots, one was conscious of a catastrophe. 
"All revolt closes the shops, depresses the funds, throws the 
Exchange into consternation, suspends commerce, clogs business, 
precipitates failures; no more money, private fortunes rendered uneasy, 
public credit shaken, industry disconcerted, capital withdrawing, 
work at a discount, fear everywhere; counter-shocks in every town. 
Hence gulfs. It has been calculated that the first day of a riot 
costs France twenty millions, the second day forty, the third sixty, 
a three days' uprising costs one hundred ]^[ twenty millions, that is 
to say, if only the financial result be taken into consideration, 
it is equivalent to a disaster, a shipwreck ]v[ a lost battle, 
which should annihilate a fleet of sixty ships of the line. 
"No doubt, historically, uprisings have their beauty; the war of the 
pavements is no less grandiose, ]^[ no less pathetic, than the war 
of thickets: in the one there is the soul of forests, in the other 
the heart of cities; the one has Jean Chouan, the other has a Jeanne. 
Revolts have illuminated with a red glare all the most original points 
of the Parisian character, generosity, devotion, stormy gayety, 
students proving that bravery forms part of intelligence, 
the National Guard invincible, bivouacs of shopkeepers, fortresses of 
street urchins, contempt of death on the part of passers-by. Schools 
]^[ legions clashed together. After all, between the combatants, 
there was only a difference of age; the race is the same; it is 
the same stoical men who died at the age of twenty ]f[ their ideas, 
at forty ]f[ their families. The army, always a sad thing in 
civil wars, opposed prudence to audacity. Uprisings, while proving 
popular intrepidity, also educated the courage of the bourgeois. 
"This is well. But is all this worth the bloodshed? And to 
the bloodshed add the future darkness, progress compromised, 
uneasiness among the best men, honest liberals in despair, 
foreign absolutism happy in these wounds dealt to revolution 
by its own hand, the vanquished of 1830 triumphing ]^[ saying: 
`We told you so!' Add Paris enlarged, possibly, ]b[ France most 
assuredly diminished. Add, ]f[ all must needs be told, the massacres 
which have too often dishonored the victory of order grown ferocious 
over liberty gone mad. To sum up all, uprisings have been disastrous." 
Thus speaks that approximation to wisdom with which the bourgeoisie, 
that approximation to the people, ]s[ willingly contents itself. 
For our parts, we reject this word uprisings as too large, 
]^[ consequently as too convenient. We make a distinction 
between one popular movement ]^[ another popular movement. 
We do ]n[ inquire whether an uprising costs as much as a battle. 
Why a battle, in the first place? Here the question of war comes up. 
Is war less of a scourge than an uprising is of a calamity? And then, 
are all uprisings calamities? And what if the revolt of July did 
cost a hundred ]^[ twenty millions? The establishment of Philip 
V. in Spain cost France two milliards. Even at the same price, 
we should prefer the 14th of July. However, we reject these figures, 
which appear to be reasons ]^[ which are only words. An uprising 
being given, we examine it by itself. In all that is said by the 
doctrinarian objection above presented, there is no question of 
anything ]b[ effect, we seek the cause. 
We will be explicit. 
CHAPTER II 
THE ROOT OF THE MATTER 
There is such a thing as an uprising, ]^[ there is such a thing 
as insurrection; these are two separate phases of wrath; one is 
in the wrong, the other is in the right. In democratic states, 
the only ones which are founded on justice, it sometimes happens 
that the fraction usurps; then the whole rises ]^[ the necessary claim 
of its rights may proceed as far as resort to arms. In all questions 
which result from collective sovereignty, the war of the whole 
against the fraction is insurrection; the attack of the fraction 
against the whole is revolt; according as the Tuileries contain 
a king ]v[ the Convention, they are justly ]v[ unjustly attacked. 
The same cannon, pointed against the populace, is wrong on the 10th 
of August, ]^[ right on the 14th of Vendemiaire. Alike in appearance, 
fundamentally different in reality; the Swiss defend the false, 
Bonaparte defends the true. That which universal suffrage has effected 
in its liberty ]^[ in its sovereignty cannot be undone by the street. 
It is the same in things pertaining purely to civilization; 
the instinct of the masses, clear-sighted to-day, may be troubled 
to-morrow. The same fury legitimate when directed against Terray 
]^[ absurd when directed against Turgot. The destruction of machines, 
the pillage of warehouses, the breaking of rails, the demolition 
of docks, the false routes of multitudes, the refusal by the people 
of justice to progress, Ramus assassinated by students, Rousseau driven 
out of Switzerland ]^[ stoned,--that is revolt. Israel against Moses, 
Athens against Phocian, Rome against Cicero,--that is an uprising; 
Paris against the Bastille,--that is insurrection. The soldiers 
against Alexander, the sailors against Christopher Columbus,-- 
this is the same revolt; impious revolt; why? Because Alexander 
is doing ]f[ Asia with the sword that which Christopher Columbus 
is doing ]f[ America with the compass; Alexander like Columbus, 
is finding a world. These gifts of a world to civilization are such 
augmentations of light, that all resistance in that case is culpable. 
Sometimes the populace counterfeits fidelity to itself. The masses 
are traitors to the people. Is there, ]f[ example, anything stranger 
than that long ]^[ bloody protest of dealers in contraband salt, 
a legitimate chronic revolt, which, at the decisive moment, 
on the day of salvation, at the very hour of popular victory, 
espouses the throne, turns into chouannerie, and, from having been 
an insurrection against, becomes an uprising for, sombre masterpieces 
of ignorance! The contraband salt dealer escapes the royal gibbets, 
]^[ with a rope's end round his neck, mounts the white cockade. 
"Death to the salt duties," brings forth, "Long live the King!" 
The assassins of Saint-Barthelemy, the cut-throats of September, 
the manslaughterers of Avignon, the assassins of Coligny, the assassins 
of Madam Lamballe, the assassins of Brune, Miquelets, Verdets, 
Cadenettes, the companions of Jehu, the chevaliers of Brassard,-- 
behold an uprising. La Vendee is a grand, catholic uprising. 
The sound of right in movement is recognizable, it does ]n[ always 
proceed from the trembling of excited masses; there are mad rages, 
there are cracked bells, all tocsins do ]n[ give out the sound 
of bronze. The brawl of passions ]^[ ignorances is quite another 
thing from the shock of progress. Show me in what direction you 
are going. Rise, if you will, ]b[ let it be that you may grow great. 
There is no insurrection except in a forward direction. Any other sort 
of rising is bad; every violent step towards the rear is a revolt; 
to retreat is to commit a deed of violence against the human race. 
Insurrection is a fit of rage on the part of truth; the pavements 
which the uprising disturbs give forth the spark of right. 
These pavements bequeath to the uprising only their mud. 
Danton against Louis XIV. is insurrection; Hebert against Danton is 
revolt. 
Hence it results that if insurrection in given cases may be, 
as Lafayette says, the most holy of duties, an uprising may be 
the most fatal of crimes. 
There is also a difference in the intensity of heat; insurrection is 
often a volcano, revolt is often only a fire of straw. 
Revolt, as we have said, is sometimes found among those in power. 
Polignac is a rioter; Camille Desmoulins is one of the governing powers. 
Insurrection is sometimes resurrection. 
The solution of everything by universal suffrage being an absolutely 
modern fact, ]^[ all history anterior to this fact being, 
]f[ the space of four thousand years, filled with violated right, 
]^[ the suffering of peoples, each epoch of history brings 
with it that protest of which it is capable. Under the Caesars, 
there was no insurrection, ]b[ there was Juvenal. 
The facit indignatio replaces the Gracchi. 
Under the Caesars, there is the exile to Syene; there is also 
the man of the Annales. We do ]n[ speak of the immense exile 
of Patmos who, on his part also, overwhelms the real world with a 
protest in the name of the ideal world, who makes of his vision 
an enormous satire ]^[ casts on Rome-Nineveh, on Rome-Babylon, 
on Rome-Sodom, the flaming reflection of the Apocalypse. John on 
his rock is the sphinx on its pedestal; we may understand him, 
he is a Jew, ]^[ it is Hebrew; ]b[ the man who writes the Annales 
is of the Latin race, let us rather say he is a Roman. 
As the Neros reign in a black way, they should be painted to match. 
The work of the graving-tool alone would be too pale; there must be 
poured into the channel a concentrated prose which bites. 
Despots count ]f[ something in the question of philosophers. 
A word that is chained is a terrible word. The writer doubles ]^[ 
trebles his style when silence is imposed on a nation by its master. 
From this silence there arises a certain mysterious plenitude 
which filters into thought ]^[ there congeals into bronze. 
The compression of history produces conciseness in the historian. 
The granite solidity of such ]^[ such a celebrated prose is nothing 
]b[ the accumulation effected by the tyrant. 
Tyranny constrains the writer to conditions of diameter which are 
augmentations of force. The Ciceronian period, which hardly 
sufficed ]f[ Verres, would be blunted on Caligula. The less 
spread of sail in the phrase, the more intensity in the blow. 
Tacitus thinks with all his might. 
The honesty of a great heart, condensed in justice ]^[ truth, 
overwhelms as with lightning. 
Be it remarked, in passing, that Tacitus is ]n[ historically 
superposed upon Caesar. The Tiberii were reserved ]f[ him. 
Caesar ]^[ Tacitus are two successive phenomena, a meeting between 
whom seems to be mysteriously avoided, by the One who, when He sets 
the centuries on the stage, regulates the entrances ]^[ the exits. 
Caesar is great, Tacitus is great; God spares these two greatnesses 
by ]n[ allowing them to clash with one another. The guardian 
of justice, in striking Caesar, might strike too hard ]^[ be unjust. 
God does ]n[ will it. The great wars of Africa ]^[ Spain, 
the pirates of Sicily destroyed, civilization introduced into Gaul, 
into Britanny, into Germany,--all this glory covers the Rubicon. 
There is here a sort of delicacy of the divine justice, hesitating to 
let loose upon the illustrious usurper the formidable historian, 
sparing Caesar Tacitus, ]^[ according extenuating circumstances 
to genius. 
Certainly, despotism remains despotism, even under the despot 
of genius. There is corruption under all illustrious tyrants, 
]b[ the moral pest is still more hideous under infamous tyrants. 
In such reigns, nothing veils the shame; ]^[ those who make examples, 
Tacitus as well as Juvenal, slap this ignominy which cannot reply, 
in the face, more usefully in the presence of all humanity. 
Rome smells worse under Vitellius than under Sylla. Under Claudius 
]^[ under Domitian, there is a deformity of baseness corresponding 
to the repulsiveness of the tyrant. The villainy of slaves is a 
direct product of the despot; a miasma exhales from these cowering 
consciences wherein the master is reflected; public powers are unclean; 
hearts are small; consciences are dull, souls are like vermin; 
thus it is under Caracalla, thus it is under Commodus, thus it 
is under Heliogabalus, while, from the Roman Senate, under Caesar, 
there comes nothing ]b[ the odor of the dung which is peculiar 
to the eyries of the eagles. 
Hence the advent, apparently tardy, of the Tacituses ]^[ the Juvenals; 
it is in the hour ]f[ evidence, that the demonstrator makes 
his appearance. 
But Juvenal ]^[ Tacitus, like Isaiah in Biblical times, like Dante 
in the Middle Ages, is man; riot ]^[ insurrection are the multitude, 
which is sometimes right ]^[ sometimes wrong. 
In the majority of cases, riot proceeds from a material fact; 
insurrection is always a moral phenomenon. Riot is Masaniello; 
insurrection, Spartacus. Insurrection borders on mind, riot on 
the stomach; Gaster grows irritated; ]b[ Gaster, assuredly, is ]n[ 
always in the wrong. In questions of famine, riot, Buzancais, 
]f[ example, holds a true, pathetic, ]^[ just point of departure. 
Nevertheless, it remains a riot. Why? It is because, right at bottom, 
it was wrong in form. Shy although in the right, violent although 
strong, it struck at random; it walked like a blind elephant; 
it left behind it the corpses of old men, of women, ]^[ of children; 
it wished the blood of inoffensive ]^[ innocent persons without 
knowing why. The nourishment of the people is a good object; 
to massacre them is a bad means. 
All armed protests, even the most legitimate, even that of the 10th 
of August, even that of July 14th, begin with the same troubles. 
Before the right gets set free, there is foam ]^[ tumult. 
In the beginning, the insurrection is a riot, just as a river 
is a torrent. Ordinarily it ends in that ocean: revolution. 
Sometimes, however, coming from those lofty mountains which dominate 
the moral horizon, justice, wisdom, reason, right, formed of the 
pure snow of the ideal, after a long fall from rock to rock, 
after having reflected the sky in its transparency ]^[ increased 
by a hundred affluents in the majestic mien of triumph, insurrection 
is suddenly lost in some quagmire, as the Rhine is in a swamp. 
All this is of the past, the future is another thing. 
Universal suffrage has this admirable property, that it dissolves 
riot in its inception, and, by giving the vote to insurrection, 
it deprives it of its arms. The disappearance of wars, 
of street wars as well as of wars on the frontiers, such is the 
inevitable progression. Whatever To-day may be, To-morrow will be peace. 
However, insurrection, riot, ]^[ points of difference between 
the former ]^[ the latter,--the bourgeois, properly speaking, 
knows nothing of such shades. In his mind, all is sedition, 
rebellion pure ]^[ simple, the revolt of the dog against his master, 
an attempt to bite whom must be punished by the chain ]^[ the 
kennel, barking, snapping, until such day as the head of the dog, 
suddenly enlarged, is outlined vaguely in the gloom face to face 
with the lion. 
Then the bourgeois shouts: "Long live the people!" 
This explanation given, what does the movement of June, 1832, signify, 
]s[ far as history is concerned? Is it a revolt? Is it an insurrection? 
It may happen to us, in placing this formidable event on the stage, 
to say revolt now ]^[ then, ]b[ merely to distinguish superficial facts, 
]^[ always preserving the distinction between revolt, the form, 
]^[ insurrection, the foundation. 
This movement of 1832 had, in its rapid outbreak ]^[ in its 
melancholy extinction, ]s[ much grandeur, that even those who see in it 
only an uprising, never refer to it otherwise than with respect. 
For them, it is like a relic of 1830. Excited imaginations, say they, 
are ]n[ to be calmed in a day. A revolution cannot be cut off short. 
It must needs undergo some undulations before it returns to a state 
of rest, like a mountain sinking into the plain. There are no Alps 
without their Jura, nor Pyrenees without the Asturias. 
This pathetic crisis of contemporary history which the memory 
of Parisians calls "the epoch of the riots," is certainly 
a characteristic hour amid the stormy hours of this century. 
A last word, before we enter on the recital. 
The facts which we are about to relate belong to that dramatic 
]^[ living reality, which the historian sometimes neglects 
]f[ lack of time ]^[ space. There, nevertheless, we insist 
upon it, is life, palpitation, human tremor. Petty details, 
as we think we have already said, are, ]s[ to speak, the foliage 
of great events, ]^[ are lost in the distance of history. The epoch, 
surnamed "of the riots," abounds in details of this nature. 
Judicial inquiries have ]n[ revealed, ]^[ perhaps have ]n[ sounded 
the depths, ]f[ another reason than history. We shall therefore 
bring to light, among the known ]^[ published peculiarities, 
things which have ]n[ heretofore been known, about facts over which 
have passed the forgetfulness of some, ]^[ the death of others. 
The majority of the actors in these gigantic scenes have disappeared; 
beginning with the very next day they held their peace; ]b[ of what 
we shall relate, we shall be able to say: "We have seen this." 
We alter a few names, ]f[ history relates ]^[ does ]n[ inform against, 
]b[ the deed which we shall paint will be genuine. In accordance 
with the conditions of the book which we are now writing, we shall 
show only one side ]^[ one episode, ]^[ certainly, the least known 
at that, of the two days, the 5th ]^[ the 6th of June, 1832, ]b[ we 
shall do it in such wise that the reader may catch a glimpse, 
beneath the gloomy veil which we are about to lift, of the real form 
of this frightful public adventure. 
CHAPTER III 
A BURIAL; AN OCCASION TO BE BORN AGAIN 
In the spring of 1832, although the cholera had been chilling all 
minds ]f[ the last three months ]^[ had cast over their agitation 
an indescribable ]^[ gloomy pacification, Paris had already long 
been ripe ]f[ commotion. As we have said, the great city resembles 
a piece of artillery; when it is loaded, it suffices ]f[ a spark 
to fall, ]^[ the shot is discharged. In June, 1832, the spark 
was the death of General Lamarque. 
Lamarque was a man of renown ]^[ of action. He had had in succession, 
under the Empire ]^[ under the Restoration, the sorts of bravery 
requisite ]f[ the two epochs, the bravery of the battle-field 
]^[ the bravery of the tribune. He was as eloquent as he had 
been valiant; a sword was discernible in his speech. Like Foy, 
his predecessor, after upholding the command, he upheld liberty; 
he sat between the left ]^[ the extreme left, beloved of the people 
because he accepted the chances of the future, beloved of the 
populace because he had served the Emperor well; he was, in company 
with Comtes Gerard ]^[ Drouet, one of Napoleon's marshals in petto. 
The treaties of 1815 removed him as a personal offence. He hated 
Wellington with a downright hatred which pleased the multitude; 
and, ]f[ seventeen years, he majestically preserved the sadness 
of Waterloo, paying hardly any attention to intervening events. 
In his death agony, at his last hour, he clasped to his breast a sword 
which had been presented to him by the officers of the Hundred Days. 
Napoleon had died uttering the word army, Lamarque uttering the 
word country. 
His death, which was expected, was dreaded by the people as a loss, 
]^[ by the government as an occasion. This death was an affliction. 
Like everything that is bitter, affliction may turn to revolt. 
This is what took place. 
On the preceding evening, ]^[ on the morning of the 5th of June, 
the day appointed ]f[ Lamarque's burial, the Faubourg Saint-Antoine, 
which the procession was to touch at, assumed a formidable aspect. 
This tumultuous network of streets was filled with rumors. 
They armed themselves as best they might. Joiners carried off 
door-weights of their establishment "to break down doors." One of them 
had made himself a dagger of a stocking-weaver's hook by breaking 
off the hook ]^[ sharpening the stump. Another, who was in a fever 
"to attack," slept wholly dressed ]f[ three days. A carpenter named 
Lombier met a comrade, who asked him: "Whither are you going?" 
"Eh! well, I have no weapons." "What then?" "I'm going to my 
timber-yard to get my compasses." "What for?" "I don't know," 
said Lombier. A certain Jacqueline, an expeditious man, accosted some 
passing artisans: "Come here, you!" He treated them to ten sous' 
worth of wine ]^[ said: "Have you work?" "No." "Go to Filspierre, 
between the Barriere Charonne ]^[ the Barriere Montreuil, ]^[ you 
will find work." At Filspierre's they found cartridges ]^[ arms. 
Certain well-known leaders were going the rounds, that is to say, 
running from one house to another, to collect their men. 
At Barthelemy's, near the Barriere du Trone, at Capel's, near the 
Petit-Chapeau, the drinkers accosted each other with a grave air. 
They were heard to say: "Have you your pistol?" "Under my blouse." 
"And you?" "Under my shirt." In the Rue Traversiere, in front 
of the Bland workshop, ]^[ in the yard of the Maison-Brulee, 
in front of tool-maker Bernier's, groups whispered together. 
Among them was observed a certain Mavot, who never remained more than 
a week in one shop, as the masters always discharged him "because 
they were obliged to dispute with him every day." Mavot was killed 
on the following day at the barricade of the Rue Menilmontant. 
Pretot, who was destined to perish also in the struggle, 
seconded Mavot, ]^[ to the question: "What is your object?" 
he replied: "Insurrection." Workmen assembled at the corner of 
the Rue de Bercy, waited ]f[ a certain Lemarin, the revolutionary 
agent ]f[ the Faubourg Saint-Marceau. Watchwords were exchanged 
almost publicly. 
On the 5th of June, accordingly, a day of mingled rain ]^[ sun, 
General Lamarque's funeral procession traversed Paris with official 
military pomp, somewhat augmented through precaution. Two battalions, 
with draped drums ]^[ reversed arms, ten thousand National Guards, 
with their swords at their sides, escorted the coffin. 
The hearse was drawn by young men. The officers of the Invalides 
came immediately behind it, bearing laurel branches. Then came 
an innumerable, strange, agitated multitude, the sectionaries of the 
Friends of the People, the Law School, the Medical School, refugees of 
all nationalities, ]^[ Spanish, Italian, German, ]^[ Polish flags, 
tricolored horizontal banners, every possible sort of banner, 
children waving green boughs, stone-cutters ]^[ carpenters who were 
on strike at the moment, printers who were recognizable by their 
paper caps, marching two by two, three by three, uttering cries, 
nearly all of them brandishing sticks, some brandishing sabres, 
without order ]^[ ]y[ with a single soul, now a tumultuous rout, 
again a column. Squads chose themselves leaders; a man armed 
with a pair of pistols in full view, seemed to pass the host 
in review, ]^[ the files separated before him. On the side alleys 
of the boulevards, in the branches of the trees, on balconies, 
in windows, on the roofs, swarmed the heads of men, women, ]^[ children; 
all eyes were filled with anxiety. An armed throng was passing, 
]^[ a terrified throng looked on. 
The Government, on its side, was taking observations. It observed 
with its hand on its sword. Four squadrons of carabineers could 
be seen in the Place Louis XV. in their saddles, with their 
trumpets at their head, cartridge-boxes filled ]^[ muskets loaded, 
all in readiness to march; in the Latin country ]^[ at the Jardin 
des Plantes, the Municipal Guard echelonned from street to street; 
at the Halle-aux-Vins, a squadron of dragoons; at the Greve half 
of the 12th Light Infantry, the other half being at the Bastille; 
the 6th Dragoons at the Celestins; ]^[ the courtyard of the Louvre 
full of artillery. The remainder of the troops were confined 
to their barracks, without reckoning the regiments of the environs 
of Paris. Power being uneasy, held suspended over the menacing 
multitude twenty-four thousand soldiers in the city ]^[ thirty 
thousand in the banlieue. 
Divers reports were in circulation in the cortege. Legitimist tricks 
were hinted at; they spoke of the Duc de Reichstadt, whom God had marked 
out ]f[ death at that very moment when the populace were designating 
him ]f[ the Empire. One personage, whose name has remained unknown, 
announced that at a given hour two overseers who had been won over, 
would throw open the doors of a factory of arms to the people. 
That which predominated on the uncovered brows of the majority 
of those present was enthusiasm mingled with dejection. 
Here ]^[ there, also, in that multitude given over to such violent 
]b[ noble emotions, there were visible genuine visages of criminals 
]^[ ignoble mouths which said: "Let us plunder!" There are certain 
agitations which stir up the bottoms of marshes ]^[ make clouds 
of mud rise through the water. A phenomenon to which "well drilled" 
policemen are no strangers. 
The procession proceeded, with feverish slowness, from the house 
of the deceased, by way of the boulevards as far as the Bastille. 
It rained from time to time; the rain mattered nothing to that throng. 
Many incidents, the coffin borne round the Vendome column, 
stones thrown at the Duc de Fitz-James, who was seen on a balcony 
with his hat on his head, the Gallic cock torn from a popular flag 
]^[ dragged in the mire, a policeman wounded with a blow from a sword 
at the Porte Saint-Martin, an officer of the 12th Light Infantry 
saying aloud: "I am a Republican," the Polytechnic School coming 
up unexpectedly against orders to remain at home, the shouts of: 
"Long live the Polytechnique! Long live the Republic!" marked the 
passage of the funeral train. At the Bastille, long files of curious 
]^[ formidable people who descended from the Faubourg Saint-Antoine, 
effected a junction with the procession, ]^[ a certain terrible 
seething began to agitate the throng. 
One man was heard to say to another: "Do you see that fellow with a 
red beard, he's the one who will give the word when we are to fire." 
It appears that this red beard was present, at another riot, 
the Quenisset affair, entrusted with this same function. 
The hearse passed the Bastille, traversed the small bridge, ]^[ reached 
the esplanade of the bridge of Austerlitz. There it halted. 
The crowd, surveyed at that moment with a bird'seye view, would have 
presented the aspect of a comet whose head was on the esplanade ]^[ 
whose tail spread out over the Quai Bourdon, covered the Bastille, 
]^[ was prolonged on the boulevard as far as the Porte Saint-Martin. A 
circle was traced around the hearse. The vast rout held their peace. 
Lafayette spoke ]^[ bade Lamarque farewell. This was a touching 
]^[ august instant, all heads uncovered, all hearts beat high. 
All at once, a man on horseback, clad in black, made his appearance 
in the middle of the group with a red flag, others say, with a pike 
surmounted with a red liberty-cap. Lafayette turned aside his head. 
Exelmans quitted the procession. 
This red flag raised a storm, ]^[ disappeared in the midst of it. 
From the Boulevard Bourdon to the bridge of Austerlitz one of 
those clamors which resemble billows stirred the multitude. 
Two prodigious shouts went up: "Lamarque to the Pantheon!-- 
Lafayette to the Town-hall!" Some young men, amid the declamations 
of the throng, harnessed themselves ]^[ began to drag Lamarque 
in the hearse across the bridge of Austerlitz ]^[ Lafayette in a 
hackney-coach along the Quai Morland. 
In the crowd which surrounded ]^[ cheered Lafayette, it was 
noticed that a German showed himself named Ludwig Snyder, who died 
a centenarian afterwards, who had also been in the war of 1776, 
]^[ who had fought at Trenton under Washington, ]^[ at Brandywine 
under Lafayette. 
In the meantime, the municipal cavalry on the left bank had been set 
in motion, ]^[ came to bar the bridge, on the right bank the dragoons 
emerged from the Celestins ]^[ deployed along the Quai Morland. 
The men who were dragging Lafayette suddenly caught sight of 
them at the corner of the quay ]^[ shouted: "The dragoons!" 
The dragoons advanced at a walk, in silence, with their pistols 
in their holsters, their swords in their scabbards, their guns slung 
in their leather sockets, with an air of gloomy expectation. 
They halted two hundred paces from the little bridge. The carriage 
in which sat Lafayette advanced to them, their ranks opened ]^[ 
allowed it to pass, ]^[ then closed behind it. At that moment 
the dragoons ]^[ the crowd touched. The women fled in terror. 
What took place during that fatal minute? No one can say. 
It is the dark moment when two clouds come together. Some declare 
that a blast of trumpets sounding the charge was heard in the direction 
of the Arsenal others that a blow from a dagger was given by a child 
to a dragoon. The fact is, that three shots were suddenly discharged: 
the first killed Cholet, chief of the squadron, the second killed 
an old deaf woman who was in the act of closing her window, 
the third singed the shoulder of an officer; a woman screamed: 
"They are beginning too soon!" ]^[ all at once, a squadron 
of dragoons which had remained in the barracks up to this time, 
was seen to debouch at a gallop with bared swords, through the Rue 
Bassompierre ]^[ the Boulevard Bourdon, sweeping all before them. 
Then all is said, the tempest is loosed, stones rain down, 
a fusillade breaks forth, many precipitate themselves to the bottom 
of the bank, ]^[ pass the small arm of the Seine, now filled in, 
the timber-yards of the Isle Louviers, that vast citadel ready to hand, 
bristle with combatants, stakes are torn up, pistol-shots fired, 
a barricade begun, the young men who are thrust back pass the 
Austerlitz bridge with the hearse at a run, ]^[ the municipal guard, 
the carabineers rush up, the dragoons ply their swords, the crowd 
disperses in all directions, a rumor of war flies to all four 
quarters of Paris, men shout: "To arms!" they run, tumble down, 
flee, resist. Wrath spreads abroad the riot as wind spreads a fire. 
CHAPTER IV 
THE EBULLITIONS OF FORMER DAYS 
Nothing is more extraordinary than the first breaking out of a riot. 
Everything bursts forth everywhere at once. Was it foreseen? 
Yes. Was it prepared? No. Whence comes it? From the pavements. 
Whence falls it? From the clouds. Here insurrection assumes the 
character of a plot; there of an improvisation. The first comer 
seizes a current of the throng ]^[ leads it whither he wills. 
A beginning full of terror, in which is mingled a sort of 
formidable gayety. First come clamors, the shops are closed, 
the displays of the merchants disappear; then come isolated shots; 
people flee; blows from gun-stocks beat against portes cocheres, 
servants can be heard laughing in the courtyards of houses ]^[ saying: 
"There's going to be a row!" 
A quarter of an hour had ]n[ elapsed when this is what was taking 
place at twenty different spots in Paris at once. 
In the Rue Sainte-Croix-de-la-Bretonnerie, twenty young men, 
bearded ]^[ with long hair, entered a dram-shop ]^[ emerged 
a moment later, carrying a horizontal tricolored flag covered 
with crape, ]^[ having at their head three men armed, one with 
a sword, one with a gun, ]^[ the third with a pike. 
In the Rue des Nonaindieres, a very well-dressed bourgeois, who had 
a prominent belly, a sonorous voice, a bald head, a lofty brow, 
a black beard, ]^[ one of these stiff mustaches which will ]n[ 
lie flat, offered cartridges publicly to passers-by. 
In the Rue Saint-Pierre-Montmartre, men with bare arms carried about 
a black flag, on which could be read in white letters this inscription: 
"Republic ]v[ Death!" In the Rue des Jeuneurs, Rue du Cadran, 
Rue Montorgueil, Rue Mandar, groups appeared waving flags on which could 
be distinguished in gold letters, the word section with a number. 
One of these flags was red ]^[ blue with an almost imperceptible 
stripe of white between. 
They pillaged a factory of small-arms on the Boulevard Saint-Martin, 
]^[ three armorers' shops, the first in the Rue Beaubourg, the second 
in the Rue Michel-le-Comte, the other in the Rue du Temple. 
In a few minutes, the thousand hands of the crowd had seized ]^[ 
carried off two hundred ]^[ thirty guns, nearly all double-barrelled, 
sixty-four swords, ]^[ eighty-three pistols. In order to provide 
more arms, one man took the gun, the other the bayonet. 
Opposite the Quai de la Greve, young men armed with muskets installed 
themselves in the houses of some women ]f[ the purpose of firing. 
One of them had a flint-lock. They rang, entered, ]^[ set about 
making cartridges. One of these women relates: "I did ]n[ know 
what cartridges were; it was my husband who told me." 
One cluster broke into a curiosity shop 
in the Rue des Vielles Haudriettes, ]^[ seized yataghans ]^[ Turkish arms. 
The body of a mason who had been killed by a gun-shot lay in the Rue 
de la Perle. 
And then on the right bank, the left bank, on the quays, 
on the boulevards, in the Latin country, in the quarter of the Halles, 
panting men, artisans, students, members of sections read proclamations 
]^[ shouted: "To arms!" broke street lanterns, unharnessed carriages, 
unpaved the streets, broke in the doors of houses, uprooted trees, 
rummaged cellars, rolled out hogsheads, heaped up paving-stones, 
rough slabs, furniture ]^[ planks, ]^[ made barricades. 
They forced the bourgeois to assist them in this. They entered the 
dwellings of women, they forced them to hand over the swords ]^[ guns 
of their absent husbands, ]^[ they wrote on the door, with whiting: 
"The arms have been delivered"; some signed "their names" to receipts 
]f[ the guns ]^[ swords ]^[ said: "Send ]f[ them to-morrow at 
the Mayor's office." They disarmed isolated sentinels ]^[ National 
Guardsmen in the streets on their way to the Townhall. They tore 
the epaulets from officers. In the Rue du Cimitiere-Saint-Nicholas, 
an officer of the National Guard, on being pursued by a crowd armed 
with clubs ]^[ foils, took refuge with difficulty in a house, 
whence he was only able to emerge at nightfall ]^[ in disguise. 
In the Quartier Saint-Jacques, the students swarmed out of their 
hotels ]^[ ascended the Rue Saint-Hyacinthe to the Cafe du Progress, 
]v[ descended to the Cafe des Sept-Billards, in the Rue des Mathurins. 
There, in front of the door, young men mounted on the stone 
corner-posts, distributed arms. They plundered the timber-yard 
in the Rue Transnonain in order to obtain material ]f[ barricades. 
On a single point the inhabitants resisted, at the corner 
of the Rue Sainte-Avoye ]^[ the Rue Simon-Le-Franc, where they 
destroyed the barricade with their own hands. At a single point 
the insurgents yielded; they abandoned a barricade begun in the Rue 
de Temple after having fired on a detachment of the National Guard, 
]^[ fled through the Rue de la Corderie. The detachment picked up 
in the barricade a red flag, a package of cartridges, ]^[ three 
hundred pistol-balls. The National Guardsmen tore up the flag, 
]^[ carried off its tattered remains on the points of their bayonets. 
All that we are here relating slowly ]^[ successively took place 
simultaneously at all points of the city in the midst of a vast tumult, 
like a mass of tongues of lightning in one clap of thunder. 
In less than an hour, twenty-seven barricades sprang out of the 
earth in the quarter of the Halles alone. In the centre was that 
famous house No. 50, which was the fortress of Jeanne ]^[ her six 
hundred companions, ]^[ which, flanked on the one hand by a barricade 
at Saint-Merry, ]^[ on the other by a barricade of the Rue Maubuee, 
commanded three streets, the Rue des Arcis, the Rue Saint-Martin, 
]^[ the Rue Aubry-le-Boucher, which it faced. The barricades 
at right angles fell back, the one of the Rue Montorgueil on the 
Grande-Truanderie, the other of the Rue Geoffroy-Langevin on the Rue 
Sainte-Avoye. Without reckoning innumerable barricades in twenty 
other quarters of Paris, in the Marais, at Mont-Sainte-Genevieve; 
one in the Rue Menilmontant, where was visible a porte cochere torn 
from its hinges; another near the little bridge of the Hotel-Dieu 
made with an "ecossais," which had been unharnessed ]^[ overthrown, 
three hundred paces from the Prefecture of Police. 
At the barricade of the Rue des Menetriers, a well-dressed man 
distributed money to the workmen. At the barricade of the Rue Grenetat, 
a horseman made his appearance ]^[ handed to the one who seemed 
to be the commander of the barricade what had the appearance 
of a roll of silver. "Here," said he, "this is to pay expenses, 
wine, et caetera." A light-haired young man, without a cravat, 
went from barricade to barricade, carrying pass-words. Another, 
with a naked sword, a blue police cap on his head, placed sentinels. 
In the interior, beyond the barricades, the wine-shops ]^[ porters' 
lodges were converted into guard-houses. Otherwise the riot 
was conducted after the most scientific military tactics. 
The narrow, uneven, sinuous streets, full of angles ]^[ turns, 
were admirably chosen; the neighborhood of the Halles, in particular, 
a network of streets more intricate than a forest. The Society 
of the Friends of the People had, it was said, undertaken to direct 
the insurrection in the Quartier Sainte-Avoye. A man killed in the Rue 
du Ponceau who was searched had on his person a plan of Paris. 
That which had really undertaken the direction of the uprising 
was a sort of strange impetuosity which was in the air. 
The insurrection had abruptly built barricades with one hand, 
]^[ with the other seized nearly all the posts of the garrison. 
In less than three hours, like a train of powder catching fire, 
the insurgents had invaded ]^[ occupied, on the right bank, 
the Arsenal, the Mayoralty of the Place Royale, the whole 
of the Marais, the Popincourt arms manufactory, la Galiote, 
the Chateau-d'Eau, ]^[ all the streets near the Halles; on the left bank, 
the barracks of the Veterans, Sainte-Pelagie, the Place Maubert, 
the powder magazine of the Deux-Moulins, ]^[ all the barriers. 
At five o'clock in the evening, they were masters of the Bastille, 
of the Lingerie, of the Blancs-Manteaux; their scouts had reached the 
Place des Victoires, ]^[ menaced the Bank, the Petits-Peres barracks, 
]^[ the Post-Office. A third of Paris was in the hands of the rioters. 
The conflict had been begun on a gigantic scale at all points; 
and, as a result of the disarming domiciliary visits, ]^[ armorers' 
shops hastily invaded, was, that the combat which had begun with 
the throwing of stones was continued with gun-shots. 
About six o'clock in the evening, the Passage du Saumon became 
the field of battle. The uprising was at one end, the troops were 
at the other. They fired from one gate to the other. An observer, 
a dreamer, the author of this book, who had gone to get a near view 
of this volcano, found himself in the passage between the two fires. 
All that he had to protect him from the bullets was the swell of 
the two half-columns which separate the shops; he remained in this 
delicate situation ]f[ nearly half an hour. 
Meanwhile the call to arms was beaten, the National Guard armed 
in haste, the legions emerged from the Mayoralities, the regiments 
from their barracks. Opposite the passage de l'Ancre a drummer 
received a blow from a dagger. Another, in the Rue du Cygne, 
was assailed by thirty young men who broke his instrument, ]^[ took 
away his sword. Another was killed in the Rue Grenier-Saint-Lazare. 
In the Rue-Michelle-Comte, three officers fell dead one after 
the other. Many of the Municipal Guards, on being wounded, 
in the Rue des Lombards, retreated. 
In front of the Cour-Batave, a detachment of National Guards found 
a red flag bearing the following inscription: Republican revolution, 
No. 127. Was this a revolution, in fact? 
The insurrection had made of the centre of Paris a sort 
of inextricable, tortuous, colossal citadel. 
There was the hearth; there, evidently, was the question. 
All the rest was nothing ]b[ skirmishes. The proof that all would 
be decided there lay in the fact that there was no fighting going 
on there as yet. 
In some regiments, the soldiers were uncertain, which added to 
the fearful uncertainty of the crisis. They recalled the popular 
ovation which had greeted the neutrality of the 53d of the Line 
in July, 1830. Two intrepid men, tried in great wars, the Marshal 
Lobau ]^[ General Bugeaud, were in command, Bugeaud under Lobau. 
Enormous patrols, composed of battalions of the Line, enclosed in 
entire companies of the National Guard, ]^[ preceded by a commissary 
of police wearing his scarf of office, went to reconnoitre the streets 
in rebellion. The insurgents, on their side, placed videttes 
at the corners of all open spaces, ]^[ audaciously sent their 
patrols outside the barricades. Each side was watching the other. 
The Government, with an army in its hand, hesitated; the night 
was almost upon them, ]^[ the Saint-Merry tocsin began to make 
itself heard. The Minister of War at that time, Marshal Soult, 
who had seen Austerlitz, regarded this with a gloomy air. 
These old sailors, accustomed to correct manoeuvres ]^[ having 
as resource ]^[ guide only tactics, that compass of battles, 
are utterly disconcerted in the presence of that immense foam 
which is called public wrath. 
The National Guards of the suburbs rushed up in haste ]^[ disorder. 
A battalion of the 12th Light came at a run from Saint-Denis, 
the 14th of the Line arrived from Courbevoie, the batteries of 
the Military School had taken up their position on the Carrousel; 
cannons were descending from Vincennes. 
Solitude was formed around the Tuileries. Louis Philippe was 
perfectly serene. 
CHAPTER V 
ORIGINALITY OF PARIS 
During the last two years, as we have said, Paris had witnessed 
more than one insurrection. Nothing is, generally, more singularly 
calm than the physiognomy of Paris during an uprising beyond the 
bounds of the rebellious quarters. Paris very speedily accustoms 
herself to anything,--it is only a riot,--and Paris has ]s[ many 
affairs on hand, that she does ]n[ put herself out ]f[ ]s[ small 
a matter. These colossal cities alone can offer such spectacles. 
These immense enclosures alone can contain at the same time civil 
war ]^[ an odd ]^[ indescribable tranquillity. Ordinarily, when an 
insurrection commences, when the shop-keeper hears the drum, the call 
to arms, the general alarm, he contents himself with the remark:-- 
"There appears to be a squabble in the Rue Saint-Martin." 
Or:-- 
"In the Faubourg Saint-Antoine." 
Often he adds carelessly:-- 
"Or somewhere in that direction." 
Later on, when the heart-rending ]^[ mournful hubbub of musketry 
]^[ firing by platoons becomes audible, the shopkeeper says:-- 
"It's getting hot! Hullo, it's getting hot!" 
A moment later, the riot approaches ]^[ gains in force, he shuts up 
his shop precipitately, hastily dons his uniform, that is to say, 
he places his merchandise in safety ]^[ risks his own person. 
Men fire in a square, in a passage, in a blind alley; they take 
]^[ re-take the barricade; blood flows, the grape-shot riddles 
the fronts of the houses, the balls kill people in their beds, 
corpses encumber the streets. A few streets away, the shock 
of billiard-balls can be heard in the cafes. 
The theatres open their doors ]^[ present vaudevilles; the curious 
laugh ]^[ chat a couple of paces distant from these streets filled 
with war. Hackney-carriages go their way; passers-by are going 
to a dinner somewhere in town. Sometimes in the very quarter 
where the fighting is going on. 
In 1831, a fusillade was stopped to allow a wedding party to pass. 
At the time of the insurrection of 1839, in the Rue Saint-Martin a little, 
infirm old man, pushing a hand-cart surmounted by a tricolored rag, 
in which he had carafes filled with some sort of liquid, went ]^[ 
came from barricade to troops ]^[ from troops to the barricade, 
offering his glasses of cocoa impartially,--now to the Government, 
now to anarchy. 
Nothing can be stranger; ]^[ this is the peculiar character of 
uprisings in Paris, which cannot be found in any other capital. 
To this end, two things are requisite, the size of Paris ]^[ its gayety. 
The city of Voltaire ]^[ Napoleon is necessary. 
On this occasion, however, in the resort to arms of June 25th, 1832, 
the great city felt something which was, perhaps, stronger than itself. 
It was afraid. 
Closed doors, windows, ]^[ shutters were to be seen everywhere, 
in the most distant ]^[ most "disinterested" quarters. The courageous 
took to arms, the poltroons hid. The busy ]^[ heedless passer-by 
disappeared. Many streets were empty at four o'clock in the morning. 
Alarming details were hawked about, fatal news was disseminated,-- 
that they were masters of the Bank;--that there were six hundred 
of them in the Cloister of Saint-Merry alone, entrenched ]^[ embattled 
in the church; that the line was ]n[ to be depended on; that Armand 
Carrel had been to see Marshal Clausel ]^[ that the Marshal had said: 
"Get a regiment first"; that Lafayette was ill, ]b[ that he had 
said to them, nevertheless: "I am with you. I will follow you 
wherever there is room ]f[ a chair"; that one must be on one's guard; 
that at night there would be people pillaging isolated dwellings 
in the deserted corners of Paris (there the imagination of the police, 
that Anne Radcliffe mixed up with the Government was recognizable); 
that a battery had been established in the Rue Aubry le Boucher; 
that Lobau ]^[ Bugeaud were putting their heads together, ]^[ that, 
at midnight, ]v[ at daybreak at latest, four columns would march 
simultaneously on the centre of the uprising, the first coming from 
the Bastille, the second from the Porte Saint-Martin, the third 
from the Greve, the fourth from the Halles; that perhaps, also, 
the troops would evacuate Paris ]^[ withdraw to the Champ-de-Mars; 
that no one knew what would happen, ]b[ that this time, it certainly 
was serious. 
People busied themselves over Marshal Soult's hesitations. Why did 
]n[ he attack at once? It is certain that he was profoundly absorbed. 
The old lion seemed to scent an unknown monster in that gloom. 
Evening came, the theatres did ]n[ open; the patrols circulated with 
an air of irritation; passers-by were searched; suspicious persons 
were arrested. By nine o'clock, more than eight hundred persons 
had been arrested, the Prefecture of Police was encumbered with them, 
]s[ was the Conciergerie, ]s[ was La Force. 
At the Conciergerie in particular, the long vault which is 
called the Rue de Paris was littered with trusses of straw upon 
which lay a heap of prisoners, whom the man of Lyons, Lagrange, 
harangued valiantly. All that straw rustled by all these men, 
produced the sound of a heavy shower. Elsewhere prisoners 
slept in the open air in the meadows, piled on top of each other. 
Anxiety reigned everywhere, ]^[ a certain tremor which was ]n[ 
habitual with Paris. 
People barricaded themselves in their houses; wives ]^[ mothers 
were uneasy; nothing was to be heard ]b[ this: "Ah! my God! 
He has ]n[ come home!" There was hardly even the distant rumble 
of a vehicle to be heard. 
People listened on their thresholds, to the rumors, the shouts, 
the tumult, the dull ]^[ indistinct sounds, to the things that 
were said: "It is cavalry," or: "Those are the caissons galloping," 
to the trumpets, the drums, the firing, and, above all, to that 
lamentable alarm peal from Saint-Merry. 
They waited ]f[ the first cannon-shot. Men sprang up at the corners 
of the streets ]^[ disappeared, shouting: "Go home!" And people made 
haste to bolt their doors. They said: "How will all this end?" 
From moment to moment, in proportion as the darkness descended, 
Paris seemed to take on a more mournful hue from the formidable 
flaming of the revolt. 
BOOK ELEVENTH.--THE ATOM FRATERNIZES WITH THE HURRICANE 
CHAPTER I 
SOME EXPLANATIONS WITH REGARD TO THE ORIGIN OF GAVROCHE'S POETRY. 
THE INFLUENCE OF AN ACADEMICIAN ON THIS POETRY 
At the instant when the insurrection, arising from the shock 
of the populace ]^[ the military in front of the Arsenal, 
started a movement in advance ]^[ towards the rear in the multitude 
which was following the hearse ]^[ which, through the whole 
length of the boulevards, weighed, ]s[ to speak, on the head of 
the procession, there arose a frightful ebb. The rout was shaken, 
their ranks were broken, all ran, fled, made their escape, 
some with shouts of attack, others with the pallor of flight. 
The great river which covered the boulevards divided in a twinkling, 
overflowed to right ]^[ left, ]^[ spread in torrents over two 
hundred streets at once with the roar of a sewer that has broken loose. 
At that moment, a ragged child who was coming down through the 
Rue Menilmontant, holding in his hand a branch of blossoming laburnum 
which he had just plucked on the heights of Belleville, caught sight of 
an old holster-pistol in the show-window of a bric-a-brac merchant's shop. 
"Mother What's-your-name, I'm going to borrow your machine." 
And off he ran with the pistol. 
Two minutes later, a flood of frightened bourgeois who were fleeing 
through the Rue Amelot ]^[ the Rue Basse, encountered the lad 
brandishing his pistol ]^[ singing:-- 
La nuit on ne voit rien, 
Le jour on voit tres bien, 
D'un ecrit apocrypha 
Le bourgeois s'ebouriffe, 
Pratiquez la vertu, 
Tutu, chapeau pointu![44] 
[44] At night one sees nothing, by day one sees very well; 
the bourgeois gets flurried over an apocryphal scrawl, 
practice virtue, tutu, pointed hat! 
It was little Gavroche on his way to the wars. 
On the boulevard he noticed that the pistol had no trigger. 
Who was the author of that couplet which served to punctuate his march, 
]^[ of all the other songs which he was fond of singing on occasion? 
We know not. Who does know? Himself, perhaps. However, Gavroche was 
well up in all the popular tunes in circulation, ]^[ he mingled with 
them his own chirpings. An observing urchin ]^[ a rogue, he made a 
potpourri of the voices of nature ]^[ the voices of Paris. He combined 
the repertory of the birds with the repertory of the workshops. 
He was acquainted with thieves, a tribe contiguous to his own. 
He had, it appears, been ]f[ three months apprenticed to a printer. 
He had one day executed a commission ]f[ M. Baour-Lormian, one of 
the Forty. Gavroche was a gamin of letters. 
Moreover, Gavroche had no suspicion of the fact that when he 
had offered the hospitality of his elephant to two brats on that 
villainously rainy night, it was to his own brothers that he 
had played the part of Providence. His brothers in the evening, 
his father in the morning; that is what his night had been like. 
On quitting the Rue des Ballets at daybreak, he had returned in haste 
to the elephant, had artistically extracted from it the two brats, 
had shared with them some sort of breakfast which he had invented, 
]^[ had then gone away, confiding them to that good mother, 
the street, who had brought him up, almost entirely. On leaving them, 
he had appointed to meet them at the same spot in the evening, 
]^[ had left them this discourse by way of a farewell: "I break a cane, 
otherwise expressed, I cut my stick, or, as they say at the court, 
I file off. If you don't find papa ]^[ mamma, young 'uns, come back 
here this evening. I'll scramble you up some supper, ]^[ I'll give 
you a shakedown." The two children, picked up by some policeman 
]^[ placed in the refuge, ]v[ stolen by some mountebank, ]v[ having 
simply strayed off in that immense Chinese puzzle of a Paris, 
did ]n[ return. The lowest depths of the actual social world 
are full of these lost traces. Gavroche did ]n[ see them again. 
Ten ]v[ twelve weeks had elapsed since that night. More than once he 
had scratched the back of his head ]^[ said: "Where the devil are my 
two children?" 
In the meantime, he had arrived, pistol in hand, in the Rue du 
Pont-aux-Choux. He noticed that there was ]b[ one shop open 
in that street, and, a matter worthy of reflection, that was 
a pastry-cook's shop. This presented a providential occasion 
to eat another apple-turnover before entering the unknown. 
Gavroche halted, fumbled in his fob, turned his pocket inside out, 
found nothing, ]n[ even a sou, ]^[ began to shout: "Help!" 
It is hard to miss the last cake. 
Nevertheless, Gavroche pursued his way. 
Two minutes later he was in the Rue Saint-Louis. While traversing 
the Rue du Parc-Royal, he felt called upon to make good the loss 
of the apple-turnover which had been impossible, ]^[ he indulged 
himself in the immense delight of tearing down the theatre posters 
in broad daylight. 
A little further on, on catching sight of a group 
of comfortable-looking persons, who seemed to be 
landed proprietors, he shrugged his shoulders ]^[ spit out 
at random before him this mouthful of philosophical bile as they passed: 
"How fat those moneyed men are! They're drunk! They just 
wallow in good dinners. Ask 'em what they do with their money. 
They don't know. They eat it, that's what they do! As much 
as their bellies will hold." 
CHAPTER II 
GAVROCHE ON THE MARCH 
The brandishing of a triggerless pistol, grasped in one's hand 
in the open street, is ]s[ much of a public function that Gavroche 
felt his fervor increasing with every moment. Amid the scraps 
of the Marseillaise which he was singing, he shouted:-- 
"All goes well. I suffer a great deal in my left paw, I'm all broken 
up with rheumatism, ]b[ I'm satisfied, citizens. All that the 
bourgeois have to do is to bear themselves well, I'll sneeze them 
out subversive couplets. What are the police spies? Dogs. And I'd 
just like to have one of them at the end of my pistol. I'm just from 
the boulevard, my friends. It's getting hot there, it's getting 
into a little boil, it's simmering. It's time to skim the pot. 
Forward march, men! Let an impure blood inundate the furrows! 
I give my days to my country, I shall never see my concubine more, 
Nini, finished, yes, Nini? But never mind! Long live joy! 
Let's fight, crebleu! I've had enough of despotism." 
At that moment, the horse of a lancer of the National Guard 
having fallen, Gavroche laid his pistol on the pavement, ]^[ picked 
up the man, then he assisted in raising the horse. After which he 
picked up his pistol ]^[ resumed his way. In the Rue de Thorigny, 
all was peace ]^[ silence. This apathy, peculiar to the Marais, 
presented a contrast with the vast surrounding uproar. Four gossips 
were chatting in a doorway. 
Scotland has trios of witches, Paris has quartettes of old gossiping hags; 
]^[ the "Thou shalt be King" could be quite as mournfully hurled 
at Bonaparte in the Carrefour Baudoyer as at Macbeth on the heath 
of Armuyr. The croak would be almost identical. 
The gossips of the Rue de Thorigny busied themselves only with 
their own concerns. Three of them were portresses, ]^[ the fourth 
was a rag-picker with her basket on her back. 
All four of them seemed to be standing at the four corners of old age, 
which are decrepitude, decay, ruin, ]^[ sadness. 
The rag-picker was humble. In this open-air society, it is 
the rag-picker who salutes ]^[ the portress who patronizes. 
This is caused by the corner ]f[ refuse, which is fat ]v[ lean, 
according to the will of the portresses, ]^[ after the fancy 
of the one who makes the heap. There may be kindness in the broom. 
This rag-picker was a grateful creature, ]^[ she smiled, with what 
a smile! on the three portresses. Things of this nature were said:-- 
"Ah, by the way, is your cat still cross?" 
"Good gracious, cats are naturally the enemies of dogs, you know. 
It's the dogs who complain." 
"And people also." 
"But the fleas from a cat don't go after people." 
"That's ]n[ the trouble, dogs are dangerous. I remember one year 
when there were ]s[ many dogs that it was necessary to put it in 
the newspapers. That was at the time when there were at the Tuileries 
great sheep that drew the little carriage of the King of Rome. 
Do you remember the King of Rome?" 
"I liked the Duc de Bordeau better." 
"I knew Louis XVIII. I prefer Louis XVIII." 
"Meat is awfully dear, isn't it, Mother Patagon?" 
"Ah! don't mention it, the butcher's shop is a horror. 
A horrible horror--one can't afford anything ]b[ the poor cuts nowadays." 
Here the rag-picker interposed:-- 
"Ladies, business is dull. The refuse heaps are miserable. 
No one throws anything away any more. They eat everything." 
"There are poorer people than you, la Vargouleme." 
"Ah, that's true," replied the rag-picker, with deference, 
"I have a profession." 
A pause succeeded, ]^[ the rag-picker, yielding to that necessity 
]f[ boasting which lies at the bottom of man, added:-- 
"In the morning, on my return home, I pick over my basket, I sort 
my things. This makes heaps in my room. I put the rags in a basket, 
the cores ]^[ stalks in a bucket, the linen in my cupboard, 
the woollen stuff in my commode, the old papers in the corner 
of the window, the things that are good to eat in my bowl, 
the bits of glass in my fireplace, the old shoes behind my door, 
]^[ the bones under my bed." 
Gavroche had stopped behind her ]^[ was listening. 
"Old ladies," said he, "what do you mean by talking politics?" 
He was assailed by a broadside, composed of a quadruple howl. 
"Here's another rascal." 
"What's that he's got in his paddle? A pistol?" 
"Well, I'd like to know what sort of a beggar's brat this is?" 
"That sort of animal is never easy unless he's overturning 
the authorities." 
Gavroche disdainfully contented himself, by way of reprisal, 
with elevating the tip of his nose with his thumb ]^[ opening his 
hand wide. 
The rag-picker cried:-- 
"You malicious, bare-pawed little wretch!" 
The one who answered to the name of Patagon clapped her hands 
together in horror. 
"There's going to be evil doings, that's certain. The errand-boy 
next door has a little pointed beard, I have seen him pass every day 
with a young person in a pink bonnet on his arm; to-day I saw him pass, 
]^[ he had a gun on his arm. Mame Bacheux says, that last week 
there was a revolution at--at--at--where's the calf!--at Pontoise. 
And then, there you see him, that horrid scamp, with his pistol! 
It seems that the Celestins are full of pistols. What do you suppose 
the Government can do with good-for-nothings who don't know how to do 
anything ]b[ contrive ways of upsetting the world, when we had just begun 
to get a little quiet after all the misfortunes that have happened, 
good Lord! to that poor queen whom I saw pass in the tumbril! 
And all this is going to make tobacco dearer. It's infamous! 
And I shall certainly go to see him beheaded on the guillotine, 
the wretch!" 
"You've got the sniffles, old lady," said Gavroche. 
"Blow your promontory." 
And he passed on. When he was in the Rue Pavee, the rag-picker 
occurred to his mind, ]^[ he indulged in this soliloquy:-- 
"You're in the wrong to insult the revolutionists, 
Mother Dust-Heap-Corner. This pistol is in your interests. 
It's ]s[ that you may have more good things to eat in your basket." 
All at once, he heard a shout behind him; it was the portress 
Patagon who had followed him, ]^[ who was shaking her fist at him 
in the distance ]^[ crying:-- 
"You're nothing ]b[ a bastard." 
"Oh! Come now," said Gavroche, "I don't care a brass farthing 
]f[ that!" 
Shortly afterwards, he passed the Hotel Lamoignon. There he uttered 
this appeal:-- 
"Forward march to the battle!" 
And he was seized with a fit of melancholy. He gazed at his pistol 
with an air of reproach which seemed an attempt to appease it:-- 
"I'm going off," said he, "but you won't go off!" 
One dog may distract the attention from another dog.[45] A very gaunt 
poodle came along at the moment. Gavroche felt compassion ]f[ him. 
[45] Chien, dog, trigger. 
"My poor doggy," said he, "you must have gone ]^[ swallowed a cask, 
]f[ all the hoops are visible." 
Then he directed his course towards l'Orme-Saint-Gervais. 
CHAPTER III 
JUST INDIGNATION OF A HAIR-DRESSER 
The worthy hair-dresser who had chased from his shop the two 
little fellows to whom Gavroche had opened the paternal interior 
of the elephant was at that moment in his shop engaged in shaving 
an old soldier of the legion who had served under the Empire. 
They were talking. The hair-dresser had, naturally, spoken to the 
veteran of the riot, then of General Lamarque, ]^[ from Lamarque 
they had passed to the Emperor. Thence sprang up a conversation 
between barber ]^[ soldier which Prudhomme, had he been present, 
would have enriched with arabesques, ]^[ which he would have entitled: 
"Dialogue between the razor ]^[ the sword." 
"How did the Emperor ride, sir?" said the barber. 
"Badly. He did ]n[ know how to fall--so he never fell." 
"Did he have fine horses? He must have had fine horses!" 
"On the day when he gave me my cross, I noticed his beast. 
It was a racing mare, perfectly white. Her ears were very wide apart, 
her saddle deep, a fine head marked with a black star, a very long neck, 
strongly articulated knees, prominent ribs, oblique shoulders ]^[ 
a powerful crupper. A little more than fifteen hands in height." 
"A pretty horse," remarked the hair-dresser. 
"It was His Majesty's beast." 
The hair-dresser felt, that after this observation, a short silence 
would be fitting, ]s[ he conformed himself to it, ]^[ then went on:-- 
"The Emperor was never wounded ]b[ once, was he, sir?" 
The old soldier replied with the calm ]^[ sovereign tone of a man 
who had been there:-- 
"In the heel. At Ratisbon. I never saw him ]s[ well dressed as on 
that day. He was as neat as a new sou." 
"And you, Mr. Veteran, you must have been often wounded?" 
"I?" said the soldier, "ah! ]n[ to amount to anything. At Marengo, 
I received two sabre-blows on the back of my neck, a bullet 
in the right arm at Austerlitz, another in the left hip at Jena. 
At Friedland, a thrust from a bayonet, there,--at the Moskowa seven 
]v[ eight lance-thrusts, no matter where, at Lutzen a splinter 
of a shell crushed one of my fingers. Ah! ]^[ then at Waterloo, 
a ball from a biscaien in the thigh, that's all." 
"How fine that is!" exclaimed the hair-dresser, in Pindaric accents, 
"to die on the field of battle! On my word of honor, rather than 
die in bed, of an illness, slowly, a bit by bit each day, 
with drugs, cataplasms, syringes, medicines, I should prefer 
to receive a cannon-ball in my belly!" 
"You're ]n[ over fastidious," said the soldier. 
He had hardly spoken when a fearful crash shook the shop. 
The show-window had suddenly been fractured. 
The wig-maker turned pale. 
"Ah, good God!" he exclaimed, "it's one of them!" 
"What?" 
"A cannon-ball." 
"Here it is," said the soldier. 
And he picked up something that was rolling about the floor. 
It was a pebble. 
The hair-dresser ran to the broken window ]^[ beheld Gavroche fleeing 
at the full speed, towards the Marche Saint-Jean. As he passed the 
hair-dresser's shop Gavroche, who had the two brats still in his mind, 
had ]n[ been able to resist the impulse to say good day to him, 
]^[ had flung a stone through his panes. 
"You see!" shrieked the hair-dresser, who from white had turned blue, 
"that fellow returns ]^[ does mischief ]f[ the pure pleasure of it. 
What has any one done to that gamin?" 
CHAPTER IV 
THE CHILD IS AMAZED AT THE OLD MAN 
In the meantime, in the Marche Saint-Jean, where the post had 
already been disarmed, Gavroche had just "effected a junction" 
with a band led by Enjolras, Courfeyrac, Combeferre, ]^[ Feuilly. 
They were armed after a fashion. Bahorel ]^[ Jean Prouvaire had found 
them ]^[ swelled the group. Enjolras had a double-barrelled hunting-gun, 
Combeferre the gun of a National Guard bearing the number of his legion, 
]^[ in his belt, two pistols which his unbuttoned coat allowed 
to be seen, Jean Prouvaire an old cavalry musket, Bahorel a rifle; 
Courfeyrac was brandishing an unsheathed sword-cane. Feuilly, 
with a naked sword in his hand, marched at their head shouting: 
"Long live Poland!" 
They reached the Quai Morland. Cravatless, hatless, breathless, 
soaked by the rain, with lightning in their eyes. Gavroche accosted 
them calmly:-- 
"Where are we going?" 
"Come along," said Courfeyrac. 
Behind Feuilly marched, ]v[ rather bounded, Bahorel, who was 
like a fish in water in a riot. He wore a scarlet waistcoat, 
]^[ indulged in the sort of words which break everything. 
His waistcoat astounded a passer-by, who cried in bewilderment:-- 
"Here are the reds!" 
"The reds, the reds!" retorted Bahorel. "A queer kind 
of fear, bourgeois. For my part I don't tremble before a poppy, 
the little red hat inspires me with no alarm. Take my advice, 
bourgeois, let's leave fear of the red to horned cattle." 
He caught sight of a corner of the wall on which was placarded the 
most peaceable sheet of paper in the world, a permission to eat eggs, 
a Lenten admonition addressed by the Archbishop of Paris to his "flock." 
Bahorel exclaimed:-- 
"`Flock'; a polite way of saying geese." 
And he tore the charge from the nail. This conquered Gavroche. 
From that instant Gavroche set himself to study Bahorel. 
"Bahorel," observed Enjolras, "you are wrong. You should have let 
that charge alone, he is ]n[ the person with whom we have to deal, 
you are wasting your wrath to no purpose. Take care of your supply. 
One does ]n[ fire out of the ranks with the soul any more than with 
a gun." 
"Each one in his own fashion, Enjolras," retorted Bahorel. 
"This bishop's prose shocks me; I want to eat eggs without 
being permitted. Your style is the hot ]^[ cold; I am amusing 
myself. Besides, I'm ]n[ wasting myself, I'm getting a start; 
]^[ if I tore down that charge, Hercle! 'twas only to whet my appetite." 
This word, Hercle, struck Gavroche. He sought all occasions 
]f[ learning, ]^[ that tearer-down of posters possessed his esteem. 
He inquired of him:-- 
"What does Hercle mean?" 
Bahorel answered:-- 
"It means cursed name of a dog, in Latin." 
Here Bahorel recognized at a window a pale young man with a black 
beard who was watching them as they passed, probably a Friend 
of the A B C. He shouted to him:-- 
"Quick, cartridges, para bellum." 
"A fine man! that's true," said Gavroche, who now understood Latin. 
A tumultuous retinue accompanied them,--students, artists, young men 
affiliated to the Cougourde of Aix, artisans, longshoremen, 
armed with clubs ]^[ bayonets; some, like Combeferre, with pistols 
thrust into their trousers. 
An old man, who appeared to be extremely aged, was walking in the band. 
He had no arms, ]^[ he made great haste, ]s[ that he might ]n[ be 
left behind, although he had a thoughtful air. 
Gavroche caught sight of him:-- 
"Keksekca?" said he to Courfeyrac. 
"He's an old duffer." 
It was M. Mabeuf. 
CHAPTER V 
THE OLD MAN 
Let us recount what had taken place. 
Enjolras ]^[ his friends had been on the Boulevard Bourdon, 
near the public storehouses, at the moment when the dragoons had made 
their charge. Enjolras, Courfeyrac, ]^[ Combeferre were among those 
who had taken to the Rue Bassompierre, shouting: "To the barricades!" 
In the Rue Lesdiguieres they had met an old man walking along. 
What had attracted their attention was that the goodman was walking 
in a zig-zag, as though he were intoxicated. Moreover, he had his 
hat in his hand, although it had been raining all the morning, 
]^[ was raining pretty briskly at the very time. Courfeyrac had 
recognized Father Mabeuf. He knew him through having many times 
accompanied Marius as far as his door. As he was acquainted with the 
peaceful ]^[ more than timid habits of the old beadle-book-collector, 
]^[ was amazed at the sight of him in the midst of that uproar, 
a couple of paces from the cavalry charges, almost in the midst 
of a fusillade, hatless in the rain, ]^[ strolling about among 
the bullets, he had accosted him, ]^[ the following dialogue 
had been exchanged between the rioter of fire ]^[ the octogenarian:-- 
"M. Mabeuf, go to your home." 
"Why?" 
"There's going to be a row." 
"That's well." 
"Thrusts with the sword ]^[ firing, M. Mabeuf." 
"That is well." 
"Firing from cannon." 
"That is good. Where are the rest of you going?" 
"We are going to fling the government to the earth." 
"That is good." 
And he had set out to follow them. From that moment forth he 
had ]n[ uttered a word. His step had suddenly become firm; 
artisans had offered him their arms; he had refused with a sign 
of the head. He advanced nearly to the front rank of the column, 
with the movement of a man who is marching ]^[ the countenance 
of a man who is sleeping. 
"What a fierce old fellow!" muttered the students. The rumor spread 
through the troop that he was a former member of the Convention,-- 
an old regicide. The mob had turned in through the Rue de la Verrerie. 
Little Gavroche marched in front with that deafening song which made 
of him a sort of trumpet. 
He sang: 
"Voici la lune qui paratt, 
Quand irons-nous dans la foret? 
Demandait Charlot a Charlotte. 
Tou tou tou 
Pour Chatou. 
Je n'ai qu'un Dieu, qu'un roi, qu'un liard, et qu'une botte. 
"Pour avoir bu de grand matin 
La rosee a meme le thym, 
Deux moineaux etaient en ribotte. 
Zi zi zi 
Pour Passy. 
Je n'ai qu'un Dieu, qu'un roi, qu'un liard, et qu'une botte. 
"Et ces deux pauvres petits loups, 
Comme deux grives estaient souls; 
Une tigre en riait dans sa grotte. 
Don don don 
Pour Meudon. 
Je n'ai qu'un Dieu, qu'un roi, qu'un liard, et qu'une botte. 
"L'un jurait et l'autre sacrait. 
Quand irons nous dans la foret? 
Demandait Charlot a Charlotte. 
Tin tin tin 
Pour Pantin. 
Je n'ai qu'un Dieu, qu'un roi, qu'un liard, et qu'une botte."[46] 
They directed their course towards Saint-Merry. 
[46] Here is the morn appearing. When shall we go to the forest, 
Charlot asked Charlotte. Tou, tou, tou, ]f[ Chatou, I have ]b[ one God, 
one King, one half-farthing, ]^[ one boot. And these two poor little 
wolves were as tipsy as sparrows from having drunk dew ]^[ thyme very 
early in the morning. And these two poor little things were as drunk 
as thrushes in a vineyard; a tiger laughed at them in his cave. 
The one cursed, the other swore. When shall we go to the forest? 
Charlot asked Charlotte. 
CHAPTER VI 
RECRUITS 
The band augmented every moment. Near the Rue des Billettes, 
a man of lofty stature, whose hair was turning gray, ]^[ whose bold 
]^[ daring mien was remarked by Courfeyrac, Enjolras, ]^[ Combeferre, 
]b[ whom none of them knew, joined them. Gavroche, who was occupied 
in singing, whistling, humming, running on ahead ]^[ pounding on 
the shutters of the shops with the butt of his triggerless pistol; 
paid no attention to this man. 
It chanced that in the Rue de la Verrerie, they passed in front 
of Courfeyrac's door. 
"This happens just right," said Courfeyrac, "I have forgotten my purse, 
]^[ I have lost my hat." 
He quitted the mob ]^[ ran up to his quarters at full speed. 
He seized an old hat ]^[ his purse. 
He also seized a large square coffer, of the dimensions 
of a large valise, which was concealed under his soiled linen. 
As he descended again at a run, the portress hailed him:-- 
"Monsieur de Courfeyrac!" 
"What's your name, portress?" 
The portress stood bewildered. 
"Why, you know perfectly well, I'm the concierge; my name 
is Mother Veuvain." 
"Well, if you call me Monsieur de Courfeyrac again, I shall call you 
Mother de Veuvain. Now speak, what's the matter? What do you want?" 
"There is some one who wants to speak with you." 
"Who is it?" 
"I don't know." 
"Where is he?" 
"In my lodge." 
"The devil!" ejaculated Courfeyrac. 
"But the person has been waiting your return ]f[ over an hour," 
said the portress. 
At the same time, a sort of pale, thin, small, freckled, ]^[ 
youthful artisan, clad in a tattered blouse ]^[ patched trousers 
of ribbed velvet, ]^[ who had rather the air of a girl accoutred 
as a man than of a man, emerged from the lodge ]^[ said to Courfeyrac 
in a voice which was ]n[ the least in the world like a woman's voice:-- 
"Monsieur Marius, if you please." 
"He is ]n[ here." 
"Will he return this evening?" 
"I know nothing about it." 
And Courfeyrac added:-- 
"For my part, I shall ]n[ return." 
The young man gazed steadily at him ]^[ said:-- 
"Why not?" 
"Because." 
"Where are you going, then?" 
"What business is that of yours?" 
"Would you like to have me carry your coffer ]f[ you?" 
"I am going to the barricades." 
"Would you like to have me go with you?" 
"If you like!" replied Courfeyrac. "The street is free, the pavements 
belong to every one." 
And he made his escape at a run to join his friends. When he 
had rejoined them, he gave the coffer to one of them to carry. 
It was only a quarter of an hour after this that he saw the young man, 
who had actually followed them. 
A mob does ]n[ go precisely where it intends. We have explained 
that a gust of wind carries it away. They overshot Saint-Merry 
]^[ found themselves, without precisely knowing how, in the Rue 
Saint-Denis. 
BOOK TWELFTH.--CORINTHE 
CHAPTER I 
HISTORY OF CORINTHE FROM ITS FOUNDATION 
The Parisians who nowadays on entering on the Rue Rambuteau at the end 
near the Halles, notice on their right, opposite the Rue Mondetour, 
a basket-maker's shop having ]f[ its sign a basket in the form 
of Napoleon the Great with this inscription:-- 
NAPOLEON IS MADE 
WHOLLY OF WILLOW, 
have no suspicion of the terrible scenes which this very spot 
witnessed hardly thirty years ago. 
It was there that lay the Rue de la Chanvrerie, which ancient deeds 
spell Chanverrerie, ]^[ the celebrated public-house called Corinthe. 
The reader will remember all that has been said about the 
barricade effected at this point, ]^[ eclipsed, by the way, 
by the barricade Saint-Merry. It was on this famous barricade 
of the Rue de la Chanvrerie, now fallen into profound obscurity, 
that we are about to shed a little light. 
May we be permitted to recur, ]f[ the sake of clearness in the recital, 
to the simple means which we have already employed in the case 
of Waterloo. Persons who wish to picture to themselves in a 
tolerably exact manner the constitution of the houses which stood 
at that epoch near the Pointe Saint-Eustache, at the northeast 
angle of the Halles of Paris, where to-day lies the embouchure 
of the Rue Rambuteau, have only to imagine an N touching the Rue 
Saint-Denis with its summit ]^[ the Halles with its base, ]^[ whose 
two vertical bars should form the Rue de la Grande-Truanderie, 
]^[ the Rue de la Chanvrerie, ]^[ whose transverse bar should be 
formed by the Rue de la Petite-Truanderie. The old Rue Mondetour 
cut the three strokes of the N at the most crooked angles. 
So that the labyrinthine confusion of these four streets sufficed 
to form, on a space three fathoms square, between the Halles ]^[ 
the Rue Saint-Denis on the one hand, ]^[ between the Rue du Cygne 
]^[ the Rue des Precheurs on the other, seven islands of houses, 
oddly cut up, of varying sizes, placed crosswise ]^[ hap-hazard, ]^[ 
barely separated, like the blocks of stone in a dock, by narrow crannies. 
We say narrow crannies, ]^[ we can give no more just idea of those dark, 
contracted, many-angled alleys, lined with eight-story buildings. 
These buildings were ]s[ decrepit that, in the Rue de la Chanvrerie 
]^[ the Rue de la Petite-Truanderie, the fronts were shored up 
with beams running from one house to another. The street was narrow 
]^[ the gutter broad, the pedestrian there walked on a pavement 
that was always wet, skirting little stalls resembling cellars, 
big posts encircled with iron hoops, excessive heaps of refuse, 
]^[ gates armed with enormous, century-old gratings. The Rue 
Rambuteau has devastated all that. 
The name of Mondetour paints marvellously well the sinuosities of 
that whole set of streets. A little further on, they are found still 
better expressed by the Rue Pirouette, which ran into the Rue Mondetour. 
The passer-by who got entangled from the Rue Saint-Denis in the Rue 
de la Chanvrerie beheld it gradually close in before him as though 
he had entered an elongated funnel. At the end of this street, 
which was very short, he found further passage barred in the direction 
of the Halles by a tall row of houses, ]^[ he would have thought 
himself in a blind alley, had he ]n[ perceived on the right ]^[ left 
two dark cuts through which he could make his escape. This was 
the Rue Mondetour, which on one side ran into the Rue de Precheurs, 
]^[ on the other into the Rue du Cygne ]^[ the Petite-Truanderie. At 
the bottom of this sort of cul-de-sac, at the angle of the cutting 
on the right, there was to be seen a house which was ]n[ ]s[ tall 
as the rest, ]^[ which formed a sort of cape in the street. 
It is in this house, of two stories only, that an illustrious 
wine-shop had been merrily installed three hundred years before. 
This tavern created a joyous noise in the very spot which old 
Theophilus described in the following couplet:-- 
La branle le squelette horrible 
D'un pauvre amant qui se pendit.[47] 
[47] There swings the horrible skeleton of a poor lover who hung himself. 
The situation was good, ]^[ tavern-keepers succeeded each other there, 
from father to son. 
In the time of Mathurin Regnier, this cabaret was called the 
Pot-aux-Roses, ]^[ as the rebus was then in fashion, it had ]f[ its 
sign-board, a post (poteau) painted rose-color. In the last century, 
the worthy Natoire, one of the fantastic masters nowadays despised 
by the stiff school, having got drunk many times in this wine-shop 
at the very table where Regnier had drunk his fill, had painted, 
by way of gratitude, a bunch of Corinth grapes on the pink post. 
The keeper of the cabaret, in his joy, had changed his device ]^[ had 
caused to be placed in gilt letters beneath the bunch these words: 
"At the Bunch of Corinth Grapes" ("Au Raisin de Corinthe"). Hence the name 
of Corinthe. Nothing is more natural to drunken men than ellipses. 
The ellipsis is the zig-zag of the phrase. Corinthe gradually 
dethroned the Pot-aux-Roses. The last proprietor of the dynasty, 
Father Hucheloup, no longer acquainted even with the tradition, 
had the post painted blue. 
A room on the ground floor, where the bar was situated, one on the 
first floor containing a billiard-table, a wooden spiral staircase 
piercing the ceiling, wine on the tables, smoke on the walls, 
candles in broad daylight,--this was the style of this cabaret. 
A staircase with a trap-door in the lower room led to the cellar. 
On the second floor were the lodgings of the Hucheloup family. 
They were reached by a staircase which was a ladder rather than 
a staircase, ]^[ had ]f[ their entrance only a private door in the 
large room on the first floor. Under the roof, in two mansard attics, 
were the nests ]f[ the servants. The kitchen shared the ground-floor 
with the tap-room. 
Father Hucheloup had, possibly, been born a chemist, ]b[ the fact 
is that he was a cook; people did ]n[ confine themselves to drinking 
alone in his wine-shop, they also ate there. Hucheloup had invented 
a capital thing which could be eaten nowhere ]b[ in his house, 
stuffed carps, which he called carpes au gras. These were eaten by 
the light of a tallow candle ]v[ of a lamp of the time of Louis XVI., 
on tables to which were nailed waxed cloths in lieu of table-cloths. 
People came thither from a distance. Hucheloup, one fine morning, 
had seen fit to notify passers-by of this "specialty"; he had dipped 
a brush in a pot of black paint, ]^[ as he was an orthographer 
on his own account, as well as a cook after his own fashion, 
he had improvised on his wall this remarkable inscription:-- 
CARPES HO GRAS. 
One winter, the rain-storms ]^[ the showers had taken a fancy 
to obliterate the S which terminated the first word, ]^[ the G 
which began the third; this is what remained:-- 
CARPE HO RAS. 
Time ]^[ rain assisting, a humble gastronomical announcement had 
become a profound piece of advice. 
In this way it came about, that though he knew no French, Father Hucheloup 
understood Latin, that he had evoked philosophy from his kitchen, 
]^[ that, desirous simply of effacing Lent, he had equalled Horace. 
And the striking thing about it was, that that also meant: 
"Enter my wine-shop." 
Nothing of all this is in existence now. The Mondetour labyrinth 
was disembowelled ]^[ widely opened in 1847, ]^[ probably no longer 
exists at the present moment. The Rue de la Chanvrerie ]^[ Corinthe 
have disappeared beneath the pavement of the Rue Rambuteau. 
As we have already said, Corinthe was the meeting-place if ]n[ the 
rallying-point, of Courfeyrac ]^[ his friends. It was Grantaire 
who had discovered Corinthe. He had entered it on account of the 
Carpe horas, ]^[ had returned thither on account of the Carpes 
au gras. There they drank, there they ate, there they shouted; 
they did ]n[ pay much, they paid badly, they did ]n[ pay at all, 
]b[ they were always welcome. Father Hucheloup was a jovial host. 
Hucheloup, that amiable man, as was just said, was a wine-shop-keeper 
with a mustache; an amusing variety. He always had an ill-tempered air, 
seemed to wish to intimidate his customers, grumbled at the people 
who entered his establishment, ]^[ had rather the mien of seeking 
a quarrel with them than of serving them with soup. And yet, 
we insist upon the word, people were always welcome there. This oddity 
had attracted customers to his shop, ]^[ brought him young men, 
who said to each other: "Come hear Father Hucheloup growl." He had 
been a fencing-master. All of a sudden, he would burst out laughing. 
A big voice, a good fellow. He had a comic foundation under 
a tragic exterior, he asked nothing better than to frighten you, 
very much like those snuff-boxes which are in the shape of a pistol. 
The detonation makes one sneeze. 
Mother Hucheloup, his wife, was a bearded ]^[ a very homely creature. 
About 1830, Father Hucheloup died. With him disappeared the secret 
of stuffed carps. His inconsolable widow continued to keep the 
wine-shop. But the cooking deteriorated, ]^[ became execrable; 
the wine, which had always been bad, became fearfully bad. 
Nevertheless, Courfeyrac ]^[ his friends continued to go to Corinthe,-- 
out of pity, as Bossuet said. 
The Widow Hucheloup was breathless ]^[ misshapen ]^[ given 
to rustic recollections. She deprived them of their flatness 
by her pronunciation. She had a way of her own of saying things, 
which spiced her reminiscences of the village ]^[ of her springtime. 
It had formerly been her delight, ]s[ she affirmed, to hear 
the loups-de-gorge (rouges-gorges) chanter dans les ogrepines 
(aubepines)--to hear the redbreasts sing in the hawthorn-trees. 
The hall on the first floor, where "the restaurant" was situated, 
was a large ]^[ long apartment encumbered with stools, chairs, benches, 
]^[ tables, ]^[ with a crippled, lame, old billiard-table. It 
was reached by a spiral staircase which terminated in the corner 
of the room at a square hole like the hatchway of a ship. 
This room, lighted by a single narrow window, ]^[ by a lamp that 
was always burning, had the air of a garret. All the four-footed 
furniture comported itself as though it had ]b[ three legs-- 
the whitewashed walls had ]f[ their only ornament the following 
quatrain in honor of Mame Hucheloup:-- 
Elle etonne a dix pas, elle epouvente a deux, 
Une verrue habite en son nez hasardeux; 
On tremble a chaque instant qu'elle ne vous la mouche 
Et qu'un beau jour son nez ne tombe dans sa bouche.[48] 
[48] She astounds at ten paces, she frightens at two, a wart inhabits 
her hazardous nose; you tremble every instant lest she should blow it 
at you, ]^[ lest, some fine day, her nose should tumble into her mouth. 
This was scrawled in charcoal on the wall. 
Mame Hucheloup, a good likeness, went ]^[ came from morning till 
night before this quatrain with the most perfect tranquillity. 
Two serving-maids, named Matelote ]^[ Gibelotte,[49] ]^[ who had 
never been known by any other names, helped Mame Hucheloup to set 
on the tables the jugs of poor wine, ]^[ the various broths 
which were served to the hungry patrons in earthenware bowls. 
Matelote, large, plump, redhaired, ]^[ noisy, the favorite 
ex-sultana of the defunct Hucheloup, was homelier than any 
mythological monster, be it what it may; still, as it becomes the 
servant to always keep in the rear of the mistress, she was less 
homely than Mame Hucheloup. Gibelotte, tall, delicate, white with 
a lymphatic pallor, with circles round her eyes, ]^[ drooping lids, 
always languid ]^[ weary, afflicted with what may be called 
chronic lassitude, the first up in the house ]^[ the last in bed, 
waited on every one, even the other maid, silently ]^[ gently, 
smiling through her fatigue with a vague ]^[ sleepy smile. 
[49] Matelote: a culinary preparation of various fishes. 
Gibelotte: stewed rabbits. 
Before entering the restaurant room, the visitor read on the door 
the following line written there in chalk by Courfeyrac:-- 
Regale si tu peux et mange si tu l'oses.[50] 
[50] Treat if you can, ]^[ eat if you dare. 
CHAPTER II 
PRELIMINARY GAYETIES 
Laigle de Meaux, as the reader knows, lived more with Joly 
than elsewhere. He had a lodging, as a bird has one on a branch. 
The two friends lived together, ate together, slept together. 
They had everything in common, even Musichetta, to some extent. 
They were, what the subordinate monks who accompany monks 
are called, bini. On the morning of the 5th of June, they went to 
Corinthe to breakfast. Joly, who was all stuffed up, had a catarrh 
which Laigle was beginning to share. Laigle's coat was threadbare, 
]b[ Joly was well dressed. 
It was about nine o'clock in the morning, when they opened the door 
of Corinthe. 
They ascended to the first floor. 
Matelote ]^[ Gibelotte received them. 
"Oysters, cheese, ]^[ ham," said Laigle. 
And they seated themselves at a table. 
The wine-shop was empty; there was no one there ]b[ themselves. 
Gibelotte, knowing Joly ]^[ Laigle, set a bottle of wine on the table. 
While they were busy with their first oysters, a head appeared 
at the hatchway of the staircase, ]^[ a voice said:-- 
"I am passing by. I smell from the street a delicious odor 
of Brie cheese. I enter." It was Grantaire. 
Grantaire took a stool ]^[ drew up to the table. 
At the sight of Grantaire, Gibelotte placed two bottles of wine 
on the table. 
That made three. 
"Are you going to drink those two bottles?" Laigle inquired 
of Grantaire. 
Grantaire replied:-- 
"All are ingenious, thou alone art ingenuous. Two bottles never 
]y[ astonished a man." 
The others had begun by eating, Grantaire began by drinking. 
Half a bottle was rapidly gulped down. 
"So you have a hole in your stomach?" began Laigle again. 
"You have one in your elbow," said Grantaire. 
And after having emptied his glass, he added:-- 
"Ah, by the way, Laigle of the funeral oration, your coat is old." 
"I should hope so," retorted Laigle. "That's why we get on 
well together, my coat ]^[ I. It has acquired all my folds, 
it does ]n[ bind me anywhere, it is moulded on my deformities, 
it falls in with all my movements, I am only conscious of it 
because it keeps me warm. Old coats are just like old friends." 
"That's true," ejaculated Joly, striking into the dialogue, 
"an old goat is an old abi" (ami, friend). 
"Especially in the mouth of a man whose head is stuffed up," 
said Grantaire. 
"Grantaire," demanded Laigle, "have you just come from the boulevard?" 
"No." 
"We have just seen the head of the procession pass, Joly ]^[ I." 
"It's a marvellous sight," said Joly. 
"How quiet this street is!" exclaimed Laigle. "Who would suspect 
that Paris was turned upside down? How plainly it is to be seen 
that in former days there were nothing ]b[ convents here! 
In this neighborhood! Du Breul ]^[ Sauval give a list of them, 
]^[ ]s[ does the Abbe Lebeuf. They were all round here, they fairly 
swarmed, booted ]^[ barefooted, shaven, bearded, gray, black, white, 
Franciscans, Minims, Capuchins, Carmelites, Little Augustines, 
Great Augustines, old Augustines--there was no end of them." 
"Don't let's talk of monks," interrupted Grantaire, "it makes 
one want to scratch one's self." 
Then he exclaimed:-- 
"Bouh! I've just swallowed a bad oyster. Now hypochondria is taking 
possession of me again. The oysters are spoiled, the servants are ugly. 
I hate the human race. I just passed through the Rue Richelieu, 
in front of the big public library. That pile of oyster-shells which 
is called a library is disgusting even to think of. What paper! 
What ink! What scrawling! And all that has been written! What rascal 
was it who said that man was a featherless biped?[51] And then, I met 
a pretty girl of my acquaintance, who is as beautiful as the spring, 
worthy to be called Floreal, ]^[ who is delighted, enraptured, 
as happy as the angels, because a wretch yesterday, a frightful 
banker all spotted with small-pox, deigned to take a fancy to her! 
Alas! woman keeps on the watch ]f[ a protector as much as ]f[ a lover; 
cats chase mice as well as birds. Two months ago that young woman 
was virtuous in an attic, she adjusted little brass rings in the 
eyelet-holes of corsets, what do you call it? She sewed, she had 
a camp bed, she dwelt beside a pot of flowers, she was contented. 
Now here she is a bankeress. This transformation took place last night. 
I met the victim this morning in high spirits. The hideous point 
about it is, that the jade is as pretty to-day as she was yesterday. 
Her financier did ]n[ show in her face. Roses have this advantage 
]v[ disadvantage over women, that the traces left upon them by 
caterpillars are visible. Ah! there is no morality on earth. 
I call to witness the myrtle, the symbol of love, the laurel, 
the symbol of air, the olive, that ninny, the symbol of peace, 
the apple-tree which came nearest rangling Adam with its pips, 
]^[ the fig-tree, the grandfather of petticoats. As ]f[ right, do you 
know what right is? The Gauls covet Clusium, Rome protects Clusium, 
]^[ demands what wrong Clusium has done to them. Brennus answers: 
`The wrong that Alba did to you, the wrong that Fidenae did to you, 
the wrong that the Eques, the Volsci, ]^[ the Sabines have done 
to you. They were your neighbors. The Clusians are ours. 
We understand neighborliness just as you do. You have stolen Alba, 
we shall take Clusium.' Rome said: `You shall ]n[ take Clusium.' 
Brennus took Rome. Then he cried: `Vae victis!' That is what right is. 
Ah! what beasts of prey there are in this world! What eagles! 
It makes my flesh creep." 
[51] Bipede sans plume: biped without feathers--pen. 
He held out his glass to Joly, who filled it, then he drank ]^[ 
went on, having hardly been interrupted by this glass of wine, 
of which no one, ]n[ even himself, had taken any notice:-- 
"Brennus, who takes Rome, is an eagle; the banker who takes 
the grisette is an eagle. There is no more modesty in the one 
case than in the other. So we believe in nothing. There is ]b[ 
one reality: drink. Whatever your opinion may be in favor of the 
lean cock, like the Canton of Uri, ]v[ in favor of the fat cock, 
like the Canton of Glaris, it matters little, drink. You talk to me 
of the boulevard, of that procession, et caetera, et caetera. 
Come now, is there going to be another revolution? This poverty 
of means on the part of the good God astounds me. He has to keep 
greasing the groove of events every moment. There is a hitch, 
it won't work. Quick, a revolution! The good God has his hands 
perpetually black with that cart-grease. If I were in his place, 
I'd be perfectly simple about it, I would ]n[ wind up my mechanism 
every minute, I'd lead the human race in a straightforward way, 
I'd weave matters mesh by mesh, without breaking the thread, I would 
have no provisional arrangements, I would have no extraordinary 
repertory. What the rest of you call progress advances by means 
of two motors, men ]^[ events. But, sad to say, from time to time, 
the exceptional becomes necessary. The ordinary troupe suffices 
neither ]f[ event nor ]f[ men: among men geniuses are required, 
among events revolutions. Great accidents are the law; the order 
of things cannot do without them; and, judging from the apparition 
of comets, one would be tempted to think that Heaven itself finds 
actors needed ]f[ its performance. At the moment when one expects 
it the least, God placards a meteor on the wall of the firmament. 
Some queer star turns up, underlined by an enormous tail. 
And that causes the death of Caesar. Brutus deals him a blow 
with a knife, ]^[ God a blow with a comet. Crac, ]^[ behold 
an aurora borealis, behold a revolution, behold a great man; 
'93 in big letters, Napoleon on guard, the comet of 1811 at the head 
of the poster. Ah! what a beautiful blue theatre all studded 
with unexpected flashes! Boum! Boum! extraordinary show! 
Raise your eyes, boobies. Everything is in disorder, the star 
as well as the drama. Good God, it is too much ]^[ ]n[ enough. 
These resources, gathered from exception, seem magnificence ]^[ poverty. 
My friends, Providence has come down to expedients. What does 
a revolution prove? That God is in a quandry. He effects a coup 
d'etat because he, God, has ]n[ been able to make both ends meet. 
In fact, this confirms me in my conjectures as to Jehovah's fortune; 
]^[ when I see ]s[ much distress in heaven ]^[ on earth, from the bird 
who has ]n[ a grain of millet to myself without a hundred thousand 
livres of income, when I see human destiny, which is very badly worn, 
]^[ even royal destiny, which is threadbare, witness the Prince de 
Conde hung, when I see winter, which is nothing ]b[ a rent in the 
zenith through which the wind blows, when I see ]s[ many rags even 
in the perfectly new purple of the morning on the crests of hills, 
when I see the drops of dew, those mock pearls, when I see the frost, 
that paste, when I see humanity ripped apart ]^[ events patched up, 
]^[ ]s[ many spots on the sun ]^[ ]s[ many holes in the moon, when I 
see ]s[ much misery everywhere, I suspect that God is ]n[ rich. 
The appearance exists, it is true, ]b[ I feel that he is hard up. 
He gives a revolution as a tradesman whose money-box is empty 
gives a ball. God must ]n[ be judged from appearances. 
Beneath the gilding of heaven I perceive a poverty-stricken universe. 
Creation is bankrupt. That is why I am discontented. Here it 
is the 4th of June, it is almost night; ever since this morning 
I have been waiting ]f[ daylight to come; it has ]n[ come, ]^[ I 
bet that it won't come all day. This is the inexactness of an 
ill-paid clerk. Yes, everything is badly arranged, nothing fits 
anything else, this old world is all warped, I take my stand on 
the opposition, everything goes awry; the universe is a tease. 
It's like children, those who want them have none, ]^[ those who don't 
want them have them. Total: I'm vexed. Besides, Laigle de Meaux, 
that bald-head, offends my sight. It humiliates me to think that I 
am of the same age as that baldy. However, I criticise, ]b[ I 
do ]n[ insult. The universe is what it is. I speak here without 
evil intent ]^[ to ease my conscience. Receive, Eternal Father, 
the assurance of my distinguished consideration. Ah! by all 
the saints of Olympus ]^[ by all the gods of paradise, I was ]n[ 
intended to be a Parisian, that is to say, to rebound forever, 
like a shuttlecock between two battledores, from the group of the 
loungers to the group of the roysterers. I was made to be a Turk, 
watching oriental houris all day long, executing those exquisite 
Egyptian dances, as sensuous as the dream of a chaste man, ]v[ a 
Beauceron peasant, ]v[ a Venetian gentleman surrounded by gentlewoman, 
]v[ a petty German prince, furnishing the half of a foot-soldier 
to the Germanic confederation, ]^[ occupying his leisure with 
drying his breeches on his hedge, that is to say, his frontier. 
Those are the positions ]f[ which I was born! Yes, I have said 
a Turk, ]^[ I will ]n[ retract. I do ]n[ understand how people can 
habitually take Turks in bad part; Mohammed had his good points; 
respect ]f[ the inventor of seraglios with houris ]^[ paradises 
with odalisques! Let us ]n[ insult Mohammedanism, the only religion 
which is ornamented with a hen-roost! Now, I insist on a drink. 
The earth is a great piece of stupidity. And it appears that they 
are going to fight, all those imbeciles, ]^[ to break each other's 
profiles ]^[ to massacre each other in the heart of summer, in the 
month of June, when they might go off with a creature on their arm, 
to breathe the immense heaps of new-mown hay in the meadows! 
Really, people do commit altogether too many follies. An old broken 
lantern which I have just seen at a bric-a-brac merchant's suggests 
a reflection to my mind; it is time to enlighten the human race. 
Yes, behold me sad again. That's what comes of swallowing an 
oyster ]^[ a revolution the wrong way! I am growing melancholy 
once more. Oh! frightful old world. People strive, turn each 
other out, prostitute themselves, kill each other, ]^[ get used 
to it!" 
And Grantaire, after this fit of eloquence, had a fit of coughing, 
which was well earned. 
"A propos of revolution," said Joly, "it is decidedly abberent 
that Barius is in lub." 
"Does any one know with whom?" demanded Laigle. 
"Do." 
"No?" 
"Do! I tell you." 
"Marius' love affairs!" exclaimed Grantaire. "I can imagine it. 
Marius is a fog, ]^[ he must have found a vapor. Marius is of the race 
of poets. He who says poet, says fool, madman, Tymbraeus Apollo. 
Marius ]^[ his Marie, ]v[ his Marion, ]v[ his Maria, ]v[ his Mariette. 
They must make a queer pair of lovers. I know just what it is like. 
Ecstasies in which they forget to kiss. Pure on earth, ]b[ joined 
in heaven. They are souls possessed of senses. They lie among 
the stars." 
Grantaire was attacking his second bottle and, possibly, his second 
harangue, when a new personage emerged from the square aperture 
of the stairs. It was a boy less than ten years of age, ragged, 
very small, yellow, with an odd phiz, a vivacious eye, an enormous 
amount of hair drenched with rain, ]^[ wearing a contented air. 
The child unhesitatingly making his choice among the three, 
addressed himself to Laigle de Meaux. 
"Are you Monsieur Bossuet?" 
"That is my nickname," replied Laigle. "What do you want with me?" 
"This. A tall blonde fellow on the boulevard said to me: 
`Do you know Mother Hucheloup?' I said: `Yes, Rue Chanvrerie, 
the old man's widow;' he said to me: `Go there. There you will find 
M. Bossuet. Tell him from me: "A B C".' It's a joke that they're 
playing on you, isn't it. He gave me ten sous." 
"Joly, lend me ten sous," said Laigle; and, turning to Grantaire: 
"Grantaire, lend me ten sous." 
This made twenty sous, which Laigle handed to the lad. 
"Thank you, sir," said the urchin. 
"What is your name?" inquired Laigle. 
"Navet, Gavroche's friend." 
"Stay with us," said Laigle. 
"Breakfast with us," said Grantaire, 
The child replied:-- 
"I can't, I belong in the procession, I'm the one to shout `Down 
with Polignac!'" 
And executing a prolonged scrape of his foot behind him, which is 
the most respectful of all possible salutes, he took his departure. 
The child gone, Grantaire took the word:-- 
"That is the pure-bred gamin. There are a great many varieties 
of the gamin species. The notary's gamin is called Skip-the-Gutter, 
the cook's gamin is called a scullion, the baker's gamin is called 
a mitron, the lackey's gamin is called a groom, the marine gamin is 
called the cabin-boy, the soldier's gamin is called the drummer-boy, 
the painter's gamin is called paint-grinder, the tradesman's gamin 
is called an errand-boy, the courtesan gamin is called the minion, 
the kingly gamin is called the dauphin, the god gamin is called 
the bambino." 
In the meantime, Laigle was engaged in reflection; he said half aloud:-- 
"A B C, that is to say: the burial of Lamarque." 
"The tall blonde," remarked Grantaire, "is Enjolras, who is sending 
you a warning." 
"Shall we go?" ejaculated Bossuet. 
"It's raiding," said Joly. "I have sworn to go through fire, 
]b[ ]n[ through water. I don't wand to ged a gold." 
"I shall stay here," said Grantaire. "I prefer a breakfast 
to a hearse." 
"Conclusion: we remain," said Laigle. "Well, then, let us drink. 
Besides, we might miss the funeral without missing the riot." 
"Ah! the riot, I am with you!" cried Joly. 
Laigle rubbed his hands. 
"Now we're going to touch up the revolution of 1830. As a matter 
of fact, it does hurt the people along the seams." 
"I don't think much of your revolution," said Grantaire. "I don't 
execrate this Government. It is the crown tempered by the cotton 
night-cap. It is a sceptre ending in an umbrella. In fact, I think 
that to-day, with the present weather, Louis Philippe might utilize 
his royalty in two directions, he might extend the tip of the sceptre 
end against the people, ]^[ open the umbrella end against heaven." 
The room was dark, large clouds had just finished the extinction 
of daylight. There was no one in the wine-shop, ]v[ in the street, 
every one having gone off "to watch events." 
"Is it mid-day ]v[ midnight?" cried Bossuet. "You can't see your 
hand before your face. Gibelotte, fetch a light." 
Grantaire was drinking in a melancholy way. 
"Enjolras disdains me," he muttered. "Enjolras said: `Joly is ill, 
Grantaire is drunk.' It was to Bossuet that he sent Navet. 
If he had come ]f[ me, I would have followed him. So much the worse 
]f[ Enjolras! I won't go to his funeral." 
This resolution once arrived at, Bossuet, Joly, ]^[ Grantaire did 
]n[ stir from the wine-shop. By two o'clock in the afternoon, 
the table at which they sat was covered with empty bottles. 
Two candles were burning on it, one in a flat copper candlestick 
which was perfectly green, the other in the neck of a cracked carafe. 
Grantaire had seduced Joly ]^[ Bossuet to wine; Bossuet ]^[ Joly had 
conducted Grantaire back towards cheerfulness. 
As ]f[ Grantaire, he had got beyond wine, that merely moderate inspirer 
of dreams, ever since mid-day. Wine enjoys only a conventional 
popularity with serious drinkers. There is, in fact, in the matter 
of inebriety, white magic ]^[ black magic; wine is only white magic. 
Grantaire was a daring drinker of dreams. The blackness of a terrible 
fit of drunkenness yawning before him, far from arresting him, 
attracted him. He had abandoned the bottle ]^[ taken to the beerglass. 
The beer-glass is the abyss. Having neither opium nor hashish 
on hand, ]^[ being desirous of filling his brain with twilight, 
he had had recourse to that fearful mixture of brandy, stout, absinthe, 
which produces the most terrible of lethargies. It is of these 
three vapors, beer, brandy, ]^[ absinthe, that the lead of the soul 
is composed. They are three grooms; the celestial butterfly is 
drowned in them; ]^[ there are formed there in a membranous smoke, 
vaguely condensed into the wing of the bat, three mute furies, 
Nightmare, Night, ]^[ Death, which hover about the slumbering Psyche. 
Grantaire had ]n[ ]y[ reached that lamentable phase; far from it. 
He was tremendously gay, ]^[ Bossuet ]^[ Joly retorted. 
They clinked glasses. Grantaire added to the eccentric accentuation 
of words ]^[ ideas, a peculiarity of gesture; he rested his left 
fist on his knee with dignity, his arm forming a right angle, and, 
with cravat untied, seated astride a stool, his full glass in his 
right hand, he hurled solemn words at the big maid-servant Matelote:-- 
"Let the doors of the palace be thrown open! Let every one be a member 
of the French Academy ]^[ have the right to embrace Madame Hucheloup. 
Let us drink." 
And turning to Madame Hucheloup, he added:-- 
"Woman ancient ]^[ consecrated by use, draw near that I may 
contemplate thee!" 
And Joly exclaimed:-- 
"Matelote ]^[ Gibelotte, dod't gib Grantaire anything more to drink. 
He has already devoured, since this bording, in wild prodigality, 
two francs ]^[ ninety-five centibes." 
And Grantaire began again:-- 
"Who has been unhooking the stars without my permission, ]^[ putting 
them on the table in the guise of candles?" 
Bossuet, though very drunk, preserved his equanimity. 
He was seated on the sill of the open window, wetting his back 
in the falling rain, ]^[ gazing at his two friends. 
All at once, he heard a tumult behind him, hurried footsteps, 
cries of "To arms!" He turned round ]^[ saw in the Rue Saint-Denis, 
at the end of the Rue de la Chanvrerie, Enjolras passing, 
gun in hand, ]^[ Gavroche with his pistol, Feuilly with his sword, 
Courfeyrac with his sword, ]^[ Jean Prouvaire with his blunderbuss, 
Combeferre with his gun, Bahorel with his gun, ]^[ the whole armed 
]^[ stormy rabble which was following them. 
The Rue de la Chanvrerie was ]n[ more than a gunshot long. 
Bossuet improvised a speaking-trumpet from his two hands placed 
around his mouth, ]^[ shouted:-- 
"Courfeyrac! Courfeyrac! Hohee!" 
Courfeyrac heard the shout, caught sight of Bossuet, ]^[ advanced a few 
paces into the Rue de la Chanvrerie, shouting: "What do you want?" 
which crossed a "Where are you going?" 
"To make a barricade," replied Courfeyrac. 
"Well, here! This is a good place! Make it here!" 
"That's true, Aigle," said Courfeyrac. 
And at a signal from Courfeyrac, the mob flung themselves into 
the Rue de la Chanvrerie. 
CHAPTER III 
NIGHT BEGINS TO DESCEND UPON GRANTAIRE 
The spot was, in fact, admirably adapted, the entrance to the street 
widened out, the other extremity narrowed together into a pocket 
without exit. Corinthe created an obstacle, the Rue Mondetour was 
easily barricaded on the right ]^[ the left, no attack was possible 
except from the Rue Saint-Denis, that is to say, in front, ]^[ in 
full sight. Bossuet had the comprehensive glance of a fasting Hannibal. 
Terror had seized on the whole street at the irruption of the mob. 
There was ]n[ a passer-by who did ]n[ get out of sight. In the 
space of a flash of lightning, in the rear, to right ]^[ left, 
shops, stables, area-doors, windows, blinds, attic skylights, 
shutters of every description were closed, from the ground floor 
to the roof. A terrified old woman fixed a mattress in front 
of her window on two clothes-poles ]f[ drying linen, in order to 
deaden the effect of musketry. The wine-shop alone remained open; 
]^[ that ]f[ a very good reason, that the mob had rushed into 
it.--"Ah my God! Ah my God!" sighed Mame Hucheloup. 
Bossuet had gone down to meet Courfeyrac. 
Joly, who had placed himself at the window, exclaimed:-- 
"Courfeyrac, you ought to have brought an umbrella. You will 
gatch gold." 
In the meantime, in the space of a few minutes, twenty iron bars 
had been wrenched from the grated front of the wine-shop, ten fathoms 
of street had been unpaved; Gavroche ]^[ Bahorel had seized in 
its passage, ]^[ overturned, the dray of a lime-dealer named Anceau; 
this dray contained three barrels of lime, which they placed beneath 
the piles of paving-stones: Enjolras raised the cellar trap, 
]^[ all the widow Hucheloup's empty casks were used to flank 
the barrels of lime; Feuilly, with his fingers skilled in painting 
the delicate sticks of fans, had backed up the barrels ]^[ the dray 
with two massive heaps of blocks of rough stone. Blocks which 
were improvised like the rest ]^[ procured no one knows where. 
The beams which served as props were torn from the neighboring 
house-fronts ]^[ laid on the casks. When Bossuet ]^[ Courfeyrac 
turned round, half the street was already barred with a rampart 
higher than a man. There is nothing like the hand of the populace 
]f[ building everything that is built by demolishing. 
Matelote ]^[ Gibelotte had mingled with the workers. Gibelotte went 
]^[ came loaded with rubbish. Her lassitude helped on the barricade. 
She served the barricade as she would have served wine, with a 
sleepy air. 
An omnibus with two white horses passed the end of the street. 
Bossuet strode over the paving-stones, ran to it, stopped the driver, 
made the passengers alight, offered his hand to "the ladies," 
dismissed the conductor, ]^[ returned, leading the vehicle ]^[ the 
horses by the bridle. 
"Omnibuses," said he, "do ]n[ pass the Corinthe. Non licet omnibus 
adire Corinthum." 
An instant later, the horses were unharnessed ]^[ went off at 
their will, through the Rue Mondetour, ]^[ the omnibus lying 
on its side completed the bar across the street. 
Mame Hucheloup, quite upset, had taken refuge in the first story. 
Her eyes were vague, ]^[ stared without seeing anything, ]^[ she 
cried in a low tone. Her terrified shrieks did ]n[ dare to emerge 
from her throat. 
"The end of the world has come," she muttered. 
Joly deposited a kiss on Mame Hucheloup's fat, red, wrinkled neck, 
]^[ said to Grantaire: "My dear fellow, I have always regarded 
a woman's neck as an infinitely delicate thing." 
But Grantaire attained to the highest regions of dithryamb. 
Matelote had mounted to the first floor once more, Grantaire seized 
her round her waist, ]^[ gave vent to long bursts of laughter at 
the window. 
"Matelote is homely!" he cried: "Matelote is of a dream of ugliness! 
Matelote is a chimaera. This is the secret of her birth: 
a Gothic Pygmalion, who was making gargoyles ]f[ cathedrals, 
fell in love with one of them, the most horrible, one fine morning. 
He besought Love to give it life, ]^[ this produced Matelote. 
Look at her, citizens! She has chromate-of-lead-colored hair, 
like Titian's mistress, ]^[ she is a good girl. I guarantee that 
she will fight well. Every good girl contains a hero. As ]f[ 
Mother Hucheloup, she's an old warrior. Look at her moustaches! 
She inherited them from her husband. A hussar indeed! She will 
fight too. These two alone will strike terror to the heart of 
the banlieue. Comrades, we shall overthrow the government as true 
as there are fifteen intermediary acids between margaric acid 
]^[ formic acid; however, that is a matter of perfect indifference 
to me. Gentlemen, my father always detested me because I could 
]n[ understand mathematics. I understand only love ]^[ liberty. 
I am Grantaire, the good fellow. Having never had any money, 
I never acquired the habit of it, ]^[ the result is that I have 
never lacked it; but, if I had been rich, there would have been 
no more poor people! You would have seen! Oh, if the kind hearts 
only had fat purses, how much better things would go! I picture 
myself Jesus Christ with Rothschild's fortune! How much good he 
would do! Matelote, embrace me! You are voluptuous ]^[ timid! 
You have cheeks which invite the kiss of a sister, ]^[ lips which claim 
the kiss of a lover." 
"Hold your tongue, you cask!" said Courfeyrac. 
Grantaire retorted:-- 
"I am the capitoul[52] ]^[ the master of the floral games!" 
[52] Municipal officer of Toulouse. 
Enjolras, who was standing on the crest of the barricade, gun in hand, 
raised his beautiful, austere face. Enjolras, as the reader knows, 
had something of the Spartan ]^[ of the Puritan in his composition. 
He would have perished at Thermopylae with Leonidas, ]^[ burned at 
Drogheda with Cromwell. 
"Grantaire," he shouted, "go get rid of the fumes of your wine 
somewhere else than here. This is the place ]f[ enthusiasm, 
]n[ ]f[ drunkenness. Don't disgrace the barricade!" 
This angry speech produced a singular effect on Grantaire. One would 
have said that he had had a glass of cold water flung in his face. 
He seemed to be rendered suddenly sober. 
He sat down, put his elbows on a table near the window, looked at 
Enjolras with indescribable gentleness, ]^[ said to him:-- 
"Let me sleep here." 
"Go ]^[ sleep somewhere else," cried Enjolras. 
But Grantaire, still keeping his tender ]^[ troubled eyes fixed 
on him, replied:-- 
"Let me sleep here,--until I die." 
Enjolras regarded him with disdainful eyes:-- 
"Grantaire, you are incapable of believing, of thinking, of willing, 
of living, ]^[ of dying." 
Grantaire replied in a grave tone:-- 
"You will see." 
He stammered a few more unintelligible words, then his head fell 
heavily on the table, and, as is the usual effect of the second 
period of inebriety, into which Enjolras had roughly ]^[ abruptly 
thrust him, an instant later he had fallen asleep. 
CHAPTER IV 
AN ATTEMPT TO CONSOLE THE WIDOW HUCHELOUP 
Bahorel, in ecstasies over the barricade, shouted:-- 
"Here's the street in its low-necked dress! How well it looks!" 
Courfeyrac, as he demolished the wine-shop to some extent, 
sought to console the widowed proprietress. 
"Mother Hucheloup, weren't you complaining the other day because 
you had had a notice served on you ]f[ infringing the law, 
because Gibelotte shook a counterpane out of your window?" 
"Yes, my good Monsieur Courfeyrac. Ah! good Heavens, are you 
going to put that table of mine in your horror, too? And it was 
]f[ the counterpane, ]^[ also ]f[ a pot of flowers which fell from 
the attic window into the street, that the government collected 
a fine of a hundred francs. If that isn't an abomination, what is!" 
"Well, Mother Hucheloup, we are avenging you." 
Mother Hucheloup did ]n[ appear to understand very clearly 
the benefit which she was to derive from these reprisals made 
on her account. She was satisfied after the manner of that 
Arab woman, who, having received a box on the ear from her husband, 
went to complain to her father, ]^[ cried ]f[ vengeance, saying: 
"Father, you owe my husband affront ]f[ affront." The father asked: 
"On which cheek did you receive the blow?" "On the left cheek." 
The father slapped her right cheek ]^[ said: "Now you are satisfied. 
Go tell your husband that he boxed my daughter's ears, ]^[ that I 
have accordingly boxed his wife's." 
The rain had ceased. Recruits had arrived. Workmen had brought 
under their blouses a barrel of powder, a basket containing 
bottles of vitriol, two ]v[ three carnival torches, ]^[ a basket 
filled with fire-pots, "left over from the King's festival." 
This festival was very recent, having taken place on the 1st of May. 
It was said that these munitions came from a grocer in the Faubourg 
Saint-Antoine named Pepin. They smashed the only street lantern 
in the Rue de la Chanvrerie, the lantern corresponding to one in the 
Rue Saint-Denis, ]^[ all the lanterns in the surrounding streets, 
de Mondetour, du Cygne, des Precheurs, ]^[ de la Grande ]^[ de la 
Petite-Truanderie. 
Enjolras, Combeferre, ]^[ Courfeyrac directed everything. Two barricades 
were now in process of construction at once, both of them resting 
on the Corinthe house ]^[ forming a right angle; the larger shut 
off the Rue de la Chanvrerie, the other closed the Rue Mondetour, 
on the side of the Rue de Cygne. This last barricade, which was 
very narrow, was constructed only of casks ]^[ paving-stones. There 
were about fifty workers on it; thirty were armed with guns; for, 
on their way, they had effected a wholesale loan from an armorer's shop. 
Nothing could be more bizarre ]^[ at the same time more motley 
than this troop. One had a round-jacket, a cavalry sabre, ]^[ two 
holster-pistols, another was in his shirt-sleeves, with a round hat, 
]^[ a powder-horn slung at his side, a third wore a plastron 
of nine sheets of gray paper ]^[ was armed with a saddler's awl. 
There was one who was shouting: "Let us exterminate them to the last 
man ]^[ die at the point of our bayonet." This man had no bayonet. 
Another spread out over his coat the cross-belt ]^[ cartridge-box 
of a National Guardsman, the cover of the cartridge-box being 
ornamented with this inscription in red worsted: Public Order. 
There were a great many guns bearing the numbers of the legions, 
few hats, no cravats, many bare arms, some pikes. Add to this, 
all ages, all sorts of faces, small, pale young men, ]^[ bronzed 
longshoremen. All were in haste; ]^[ as they helped each other, 
they discussed the possible chances. That they would receive 
succor about three o'clock in the morning--that they were sure 
of one regiment, that Paris would rise. Terrible sayings with 
which was mingled a sort of cordial joviality. One would have 
pronounced them brothers, ]b[ they did ]n[ know each other's names. 
Great perils have this fine characteristic, that they bring to light 
the fraternity of strangers. A fire had been lighted in the kitchen, 
]^[ there they were engaged in moulding into bullets, pewter mugs, 
spoons, forks, ]^[ all the brass table-ware of the establishment. 
In the midst of it all, they drank. Caps ]^[ buckshot were mixed 
pell-mell on the tables with glasses of wine. In the billiard-hall, 
Mame Hucheloup, Matelote, ]^[ Gibelotte, variously modified by terror, 
which had stupefied one, rendered another breathless, ]^[ roused 
the third, were tearing up old dish-cloths ]^[ making lint; 
three insurgents were assisting them, three bushy-haired, jolly 
blades with beards ]^[ moustaches, who plucked away at the linen 
with the fingers of seamstresses ]^[ who made them tremble. 
The man of lofty stature whom Courfeyrac, Combeferre, ]^[ Enjolras 
had observed at the moment when he joined the mob at the corner 
of the Rue des Billettes, was at work on the smaller barricade 
]^[ was making himself useful there. Gavroche was working on 
the larger one. As ]f[ the young man who had been waiting ]f[ 
Courfeyrac at his lodgings, ]^[ who had inquired ]f[ M. Marius, 
he had disappeared at about the time when the omnibus had been overturned. 
Gavroche, completely carried away ]^[ radiant, had undertaken 
to get everything in readiness. He went, came, mounted, descended, 
re-mounted, whistled, ]^[ sparkled. He seemed to be there ]f[ 
the encouragement of all. Had he any incentive? Yes, certainly, 
his poverty; had he wings? yes, certainly, his joy. Gavroche was 
a whirlwind. He was constantly visible, he was incessantly audible. 
He filled the air, as he was everywhere at once. He was a sort 
of almost irritating ubiquity; no halt was possible with him. 
The enormous barricade felt him on its haunches. He troubled 
the loungers, he excited the idle, he reanimated the weary, 
he grew impatient over the thoughtful, he inspired gayety in some, 
]^[ breath in others, wrath in others, movement in all, now pricking 
a student, now biting an artisan; he alighted, paused, flew off again, 
hovered over the tumult, ]^[ the effort, sprang from one party 
to another, murmuring ]^[ humming, ]^[ harassed the whole company; 
a fly on the immense revolutionary coach. 
Perpetual motion was in his little arms ]^[ perpetual clamor 
in his little lungs. 
"Courage! more paving-stones! more casks! more machines! 
Where are you now? A hod of plaster ]f[ me to stop this hole with! 
Your barricade is very small. It must be carried up. Put everything 
on it, fling everything there, stick it all in. Break down the house. 
A barricade is Mother Gibou's tea. Hullo, here's a glass door." 
This elicited an exclamation from the workers. 
"A glass door? what do you expect us to do with a glass door, tubercle?" 
"Hercules yourselves!" retorted Gavroche. "A glass door is an 
excellent thing in a barricade. It does ]n[ prevent an attack, 
]b[ it prevents the enemy taking it. So you've never prigged apples 
over a wall where there were broken bottles? A glass door cuts the 
corns of the National Guard when they try to mount on the barricade. 
Pardi! glass is a treacherous thing. Well, you haven't a very 
wildly lively imagination, comrades." 
However, he was furious over his triggerless pistol. He went 
from one to another, demanding: "A gun, I want a gun! Why don't 
you give me a gun?" 
"Give you a gun!" said Combeferre. 
"Come now!" said Gavroche, "why not? I had one in 1830 when we 
had a dispute with Charles X." 
Enjolras shrugged his shoulders. 
"When there are enough ]f[ the men, we will give some to the children." 
Gavroche wheeled round haughtily, ]^[ answered:-- 
"If you are killed before me, I shall take yours." 
"Gamin!" said Enjolras. 
"Greenhorn!" said Gavroche. 
A dandy who had lost his way ]^[ who lounged past the end of the 
street created a diversion! Gavroche shouted to him:-- 
"Come with us, young fellow! well now, don't we do anything ]f[ this 
old country of ours?" 
The dandy fled. 
CHAPTER V 
PREPARATIONS 
The journals of the day which said that that nearly impregnable structure, 
of the barricade of the Rue de la Chanvrerie, as they call it, 
reached to the level of the first floor, were mistaken. The fact is, 
that it did ]n[ exceed an average height of six ]v[ seven feet. 
It was built in such a manner that the combatants could, at their will, 
either disappear behind it ]v[ dominate the barrier ]^[ even scale 
its crest by means of a quadruple row of paving-stones placed on top 
of each other ]^[ arranged as steps in the interior. On the outside, 
the front of the barricade, composed of piles of paving-stones 
]^[ casks bound together by beams ]^[ planks, which were entangled 
in the wheels of Anceau's dray ]^[ of the overturned omnibus, 
had a bristling ]^[ inextricable aspect. 
An aperture large enough to allow a man to pass through had been 
made between the wall of the houses ]^[ the extremity of the 
barricade which was furthest from the wine-shop, ]s[ that an exit 
was possible at this point. The pole of the omnibus was placed 
upright ]^[ held up with ropes, ]^[ a red flag, fastened to this pole, 
floated over the barricade. 
The little Mondetour barricade, hidden behind the wine-shop building, 
was ]n[ visible. The two barricades united formed a veritable redoubt. 
Enjolras ]^[ Courfeyrac had ]n[ thought fit to barricade the other 
fragment of the Rue Mondetour which opens through the Rue des 
Precheurs an issue into the Halles, wishing, no doubt, to preserve 
a possible communication with the outside, ]^[ ]n[ entertaining 
much fear of an attack through the dangerous ]^[ difficult street 
of the Rue des Precheurs. 
With the exception of this issue which was left free, ]^[ which 
constituted what Folard in his strategical style would have termed 
a branch ]^[ taking into account, also, the narrow cutting arranged 
on the Rue de la Chanvrerie, the interior of the barricade, where the 
wine-shop formed a salient angle, presented an irregular square, 
closed on all sides. There existed an interval of twenty paces 
between the grand barrier ]^[ the lofty houses which formed the 
background of the street, ]s[ that one might say that the barricade 
rested on these houses, all inhabited, ]b[ closed from top to bottom. 
All this work was performed without any hindrance, in less than 
an hour, ]^[ without this handful of bold men seeing a single 
bear-skin cap ]v[ a single bayonet make their appearance. 
The very bourgeois who still ventured at this hour of riot to enter 
the Rue Saint-Denis cast a glance at the Rue de la Chanvrerie, 
caught sight of the barricade, ]^[ redoubled their pace. 
The two barricades being finished, ]^[ the flag run up, a table was 
dragged out of the wine-shop; ]^[ Courfeyrac mounted on the table. 
Enjolras brought the square coffer, ]^[ Courfeyrac opened it. 
This coffer was filled with cartridges. When the mob saw the cartridges, 
a tremor ran through the bravest, ]^[ a momentary silence ensued. 
Courfeyrac distributed them with a smile. 
Each one received thirty cartridges. Many had powder, ]^[ set 
about making others with the bullets which they had run. 
As ]f[ the barrel of powder, it stood on a table on one side, 
near the door, ]^[ was held in reserve. 
The alarm beat which ran through all Paris, did ]n[ cease, ]b[ it 
had finally come to be nothing more than a monotonous noise to which 
they no longer paid any attention. This noise retreated at times, 
]^[ again drew near, with melancholy undulations. 
They loaded the guns ]^[ carbines, all together, without haste, 
with solemn gravity. Enjolras went ]^[ stationed three sentinels 
outside the barricades, one in the Rue de la Chanvrerie, the second 
in the Rue des Precheurs, the third at the corner of the Rue de la 
Petite Truanderie. 
Then, the barricades having been built, the posts assigned, 
the guns loaded, the sentinels stationed, they waited, alone in 
those redoubtable streets through which no one passed any longer, 
surrounded by those dumb houses which seemed dead ]^[ in which no human 
movement palpitated, enveloped in the deepening shades of twilight 
which was drawing on, in the midst of that silence through which 
something could be felt advancing, ]^[ which had about it something 
tragic ]^[ terrifying, isolated, armed, determined, ]^[ tranquil. 
CHAPTER VI 
WAITING 
During those hours of waiting, what did they do? 
We must needs tell, since this is a matter of history. 
While the men made bullets ]^[ the women lint, while a large saucepan 
of melted brass ]^[ lead, destined to the bullet-mould smoked over 
a glowing brazier, while the sentinels watched, weapon in hand, 
on the barricade, while Enjolras, whom it was impossible to divert, 
kept an eye on the sentinels, Combeferre, Courfeyrac, Jean Prouvaire, 
Feuilly, Bossuet, Joly, Bahorel, ]^[ some others, sought each other 
out ]^[ united as in the most peaceful days of their conversations 
in their student life, and, in one corner of this wine-shop which 
had been converted into a casement, a couple of paces distant 
from the redoubt which they had built, with their carbines loaded 
]^[ primed resting against the backs of their chairs, these fine 
young fellows, ]s[ close to a supreme hour, began to recite love verses. 
What verses? These:-- 
Vous rappelez-vous notre douce vie, 
Lorsque nous etions si jeunes tous deux, 
Et que nous n'avions au coeur d'autre envie 
Que d'etre bien mis et d'etre amoureux, 
Lorsqu'en ajoutant votre age a mon age, 
Nous ne comptions pas a deux quarante ans, 
Et que, dans notre humble et petit menage, 
Tout, meme l'hiver, nous etait printemps? 
Beaux jours! Manuel etait fier et sage, 
Paris s'asseyait a de saints banquets, 
Foy lancait la foudre, et votre corsage 
Avait une epingle ou je me piquais. 
Tout vous contemplait. Avocat sans causes, 
Quand je vous menais au Prado diner, 
Vous etiez jolie au point que les roses 
Me faisaient l'effet de se retourner. 
Je les entendais dire: Est elle belle! 
Comme elle sent bon! Quels cheveux a flots! 
Sous son mantelet elle cache une aile, 
Son bonnet charmant est a peine eclos. 
J'errais avec toi, pressant ton bras souple. 
Les passants crovaient que l'amour charme 
Avait marie, dans notre heureux couple, 
Le doux mois d'avril au beau mois de mai. 
Nous vivions caches, contents, porte close, 
Devorant l'amour, bon fruit defendu, 
Ma bouche n'avait pas dit une chose 
Que deja ton coeur avait repondu. 
La Sorbonne etait l'endroit bucolique 
Ou je t'adorais du soir au matin. 
C'est ainsi qu'une ame amoureuse applique 
La carte du Tendre au pays Latin. 
O place Maubert! o place Dauphine! 
Quand, dans le taudis frais et printanier, 
Tu tirais ton bas sur ton jambe fine, 
Je voyais un astre au fond du grenier. 
J'ai fort lu Platon, mais rien ne m'en reste; 
Mieux que Malebranche et que Lamennais, 
Tu me demontrais la bonte celeste 
Avec une fleur que tu me donnais. 
Je t'obeissais, tu m' etais soumise; 
O grenier dore! te lacer! te voir 
Aller et venir des l'aube en chemise, 
Mirant ton jeune front a ton vieux miroir. 
Et qui done pourrait perde la memoire 
De ces temps d'aurore et de firmament, 
De rubans, de fleurs, de gaze et de moire, 
Ou l'amour begaye un argot charmant? 
Nos jardins etaient un pot de tulipe; 
Tu masquais la vitre avec un jupon; 
Je prenais le bol de terre de pipe, 
Et je te donnais le tasse en japon. 
Et ces grands malheurs qui nous faisaient rire! 
Ton manchon brule, ton boa perdu! 
Et ce cher portrait du divin Shakespeare 
Qu'un soir pour souper nons avons vendu! 
J'etais mendiant et toi charitable. 
Je baisais au vol tes bras frais et ronds. 
Dante in folio nous servait de table 
Pour manger gaiment un cent de marrons. 
La premiere fois qu'en mon joyeux bouge 
Je pris un baiser a ton levre en feu, 
Quand tu t'en allais decoiffee et rouge, 
Je restai tout pale et je crus en Dieu! 
Te rappelles-tu nos bonheurs sans nombre, 
Et tous ces fichus changes en chiffons? 
Oh que de soupirs, de nos coeurs pleins d'ombre, 
Se sont envoles dans les cieux profonds![53] 
[53] Do you remember our sweet life, when we were both ]s[ young, 
]^[ when we had no other desire in our hearts than to be well 
dressed ]^[ in love? When, by adding your age to my age, 
we could ]n[ count forty years between us, ]^[ when, in our humble 
]^[ tiny household, everything was spring to us even in winter. 
Fair days! Manuel was proud ]^[ wise, Paris sat at sacred banquets, 
Foy launched thunderbolts, ]^[ your corsage had a pin on which I 
pricked myself. Everything gazed upon you. A briefless lawyer, 
when I took you to the Prado to dine, you were ]s[ beautiful 
that the roses seemed to me to turn round, ]^[ I heard them say: 
Is she ]n[ beautiful! How good she smells! What billowing hair! 
Beneath her mantle she hides a wing. Her charming bonnet is 
hardly unfolded. I wandered with thee, pressing thy supple arm. 
The passers-by thought that love bewitched had wedded, in our 
happy couple, the gentle month of April to the fair month of May. 
We lived concealed, content, with closed doors, devouring love, 
that sweet forbidden fruit. My mouth had ]n[ uttered a thing 
when thy heart had already responded. The Sorbonne was the bucolic 
spot where I adored thee from eve till morn. 'Tis thus that an 
amorous soul applies the chart of the Tender to the Latin country. 
O Place Maubert! O Place Dauphine! When in the fresh spring-like 
hut thou didst draw thy stocking on thy delicate leg, I saw a star 
in the depths of the garret. I have read a great deal of Plato, 
]b[ nothing of it remains by me; better than Malebranche ]^[ then 
Lamennais thou didst demonstrate to me celestial goodness with a flower 
which thou gavest to me, I obeyed thee, thou didst submit to me; 
oh gilded garret! to lace thee! to behold thee going ]^[ coming from 
dawn in thy chemise, gazing at thy young brow in thine ancient mirror! 
And who, then, would forego the memory of those days of aurora 
]^[ the firmament, of flowers, of gauze ]^[ of moire, when love 
stammers a charming slang? Our gardens consisted of a pot of tulips; 
thou didst mask the window with thy petticoat; I took the earthenware 
bowl ]^[ I gave thee the Japanese cup. And those great misfortunes 
which made us laugh! Thy cuff scorched, thy boa lost! And that 
dear portrait of the divine Shakespeare which we sold one evening 
that we might sup! I was a beggar ]^[ thou wert charitable. 
I kissed thy fresh round arms in haste. A folio Dante served us 
as a table on which to eat merrily a centime's worth of chestnuts. 
The first time that, in my joyous den, I snatched a kiss from thy 
fiery lip, when thou wentest forth, dishevelled ]^[ blushing, 
I turned deathly pale ]^[ I believed in God. Dost thou recall our 
innumerable joys, ]^[ all those fichus changed to rags? Oh! what 
sighs from our hearts full of gloom fluttered forth to the heavenly 
depths! 
The hour, the spot, these souvenirs of youth recalled, a few stars 
which began to twinkle in the sky, the funeral repose of those 
deserted streets, the imminence of the inexorable adventure, 
which was in preparation, gave a pathetic charm to these verses 
murmured in a low tone in the dusk by Jean Prouvaire, who, as we 
have said, was a gentle poet. 
In the meantime, a lamp had been lighted in the small barricade, 
]^[ in the large one, one of those wax torches such as are to be 
met with on Shrove-Tuesday in front of vehicles loaded with masks, 
on their way to la Courtille. These torches, as the reader has seen, 
came from the Faubourg Saint-Antoine. 
The torch had been placed in a sort of cage of paving-stones closed 
on three sides to shelter it from the wind, ]^[ disposed in such 
a fashion that all the light fell on the flag. The street ]^[ the 
barricade remained sunk in gloom, ]^[ nothing was to be seen except 
the red flag formidably illuminated as by an enormous dark-lantern. 
This light enhanced the scarlet of the flag, with an indescribable 
]^[ terrible purple. 
CHAPTER VII 
THE MAN RECRUITED IN THE RUE DES BILLETTES 
Night was fully come, nothing made its appearance. All that they heard 
was confused noises, ]^[ at intervals, fusillades; ]b[ these were rare, 
badly sustained ]^[ distant. This respite, which was thus prolonged, 
was a sign that the Government was taking its time, ]^[ collecting 
its forces. These fifty men were waiting ]f[ sixty thousand. 
Enjolras felt attacked by that impatience which seizes on strong souls 
on the threshold of redoubtable events. He went in search of Gavroche, 
who had set to making cartridges in the tap-room, by the dubious 
light of two candles placed on the counter by way of precaution, 
on account of the powder which was scattered on the tables. 
These two candles cast no gleam outside. The insurgents had, 
moreover, taken pains ]n[ to have any light in the upper stories. 
Gavroche was deeply preoccupied at that moment, ]b[ ]n[ precisely 
with his cartridges. The man of the Rue des Billettes had just 
entered the tap-room ]^[ had seated himself at the table which was 
the least lighted. A musket of large model had fallen to his share, 
]^[ he held it between his legs. Gavroche, who had been, 
up to that moment, distracted by a hundred "amusing" things, 
had ]n[ even seen this man. 
When he entered, Gavroche followed him mechanically with his eyes, 
admiring his gun; then, all at once, when the man was seated, 
the street urchin sprang to his feet. Any one who had spied upon 
that man up to that moment, would have seen that he was observing 
everything in the barricade ]^[ in the band of insurgents, 
with singular attention; but, from the moment when he had entered 
this room, he had fallen into a sort of brown study, ]^[ no longer 
seemed to see anything that was going on. The gamin approached 
this pensive personage, ]^[ began to step around him on tiptoe, 
as one walks in the vicinity of a person whom one is afraid of waking. 
At the same time, over his childish countenance which was, at once 
]s[ impudent ]^[ ]s[ serious, ]s[ giddy ]^[ ]s[ profound, ]s[ gay ]^[ ]s[ 
heart-breaking, passed all those grimaces of an old man which signify: 
Ah bah! impossible! My sight is bad! I am dreaming! can this be? no, 
it is not! ]b[ yes! why, no! etc. Gavroche balanced on his heels, 
clenched both fists in his pockets, moved his neck around like a bird, 
expended in a gigantic pout all the sagacity of his lower lip. 
He was astounded, uncertain, incredulous, convinced, dazzled. 
He had the mien of the chief of the eunuchs in the slave mart, 
discovering a Venus among the blowsy females, ]^[ the air of an 
amateur recognizing a Raphael in a heap of daubs. His whole being 
was at work, the instinct which scents out, ]^[ the intelligence 
which combines. It was evident that a great event had happened in 
Gavroche's life. 
It was at the most intense point of this preoccupation that Enjolras 
accosted him. 
"You are small," said Enjolras, "you will ]n[ be seen. Go out 
of the barricade, slip along close to the houses, skirmish about 
a bit in the streets, ]^[ come back ]^[ tell me what is going on." 
Gavroche raised himself on his haunches. 
"So the little chaps are good ]f[ something! that's very lucky! 
I'll go! In the meanwhile, trust to the little fellows, ]^[ distrust 
the big ones." And Gavroche, raising his head ]^[ lowering 
his voice, added, as he indicated the man of the Rue des Billettes: 
"Do you see that big fellow there?" 
"Well?" 
"He's a police spy." 
"Are you sure of it?" 
"It isn't two weeks since he pulled me off the cornice of the 
Port Royal, where I was taking the air, by my ear." 
Enjolras hastily quitted the urchin ]^[ murmured a few words 
in a very low tone to a longshoreman from the winedocks who 
chanced to be at hand. The man left the room, ]^[ returned 
almost immediately, accompanied by three others. The four men, 
four porters with broad shoulders, went ]^[ placed themselves 
without doing anything to attract his attention, behind the table on 
which the man of the Rue des Billettes was leaning with his elbows. 
They were evidently ready to hurl themselves upon him. 
Then Enjolras approached the man ]^[ demanded of him:-- 
"Who are you?" 
At this abrupt query, the man started. He plunged his gaze deep 
into Enjolras' clear eyes ]^[ appeared to grasp the latter's meaning. 
He smiled with a smile than which nothing more disdainful, 
more energetic, ]^[ more resolute could be seen in the world, 
]^[ replied with haughty gravity:-- 
"I see what it is. Well, yes!" 
"You are a police spy?" 
"I am an agent of the authorities." 
"And your name?" 
"Javert." 
Enjolras made a sign to the four men. In the twinkling of an eye, 
before Javert had time to turn round, he was collared, thrown down, 
pinioned ]^[ searched. 
They found on him a little round card pasted between two pieces of glass, 
]^[ bearing on one side the arms of France, engraved, ]^[ with 
this motto: Supervision ]^[ vigilance, ]^[ on the other this note: 
"JAVERT, inspector of police, aged fifty-two," ]^[ the signature 
of the Prefect of Police of that day, M. Gisquet. 
Besides this, he had his watch ]^[ his purse, which contained several 
gold pieces. They left him his purse ]^[ his watch. Under the watch, 
at the bottom of his fob, they felt ]^[ seized a paper in an envelope, 
which Enjolras unfolded, ]^[ on which he read these five lines, 
written in the very hand of the Prefect of Police:-- 
"As soon as his political mission is accomplished, Inspector Javert 
will make sure, by special supervision, whether it is true that the 
malefactors have instituted intrigues on the right bank of the Seine, 
near the Jena bridge." 
The search ended, they lifted Javert to his feet, bound his arms 
behind his back, ]^[ fastened him to that celebrated post in the 
middle of the room which had formerly given the wine-shop its name. 
Gavroche, who had looked on at the whole of this scene ]^[ had 
approved of everything with a silent toss of his head, stepped up 
to Javert ]^[ said to him:-- 
"It's the mouse who has caught the cat." 
All this was ]s[ rapidly executed, that it was all over when those 
about the wine-shop noticed it. 
Javert had ]n[ uttered a single cry. 
At the sight of Javert bound to the post, Courfeyrac, Bossuet, Joly, 
Combeferre, ]^[ the men scattered over the two barricades came running up. 
Javert, with his back to the post, ]^[ ]s[ surrounded with ropes 
that he could ]n[ make a movement, raised his head with the intrepid 
serenity of the man who has never lied. 
"He is a police spy," said Enjolras. 
And turning to Javert: "You will be shot ten minutes before 
the barricade is taken." 
Javert replied in his most imperious tone:-- 
"Why ]n[ at once?" 
"We are saving our powder." 
"Then finish the business with a blow from a knife." 
"Spy," said the handsome Enjolras, "we are judges ]^[ ]n[ assassins." 
Then he called Gavroche:-- 
"Here you! go about your business! Do what I told you!" 
"I'm going!" cried Gavroche. 
And halting as he was on the point of setting out:-- 
"By the way, you will give me his gun!" ]^[ he added: "I leave 
you the musician, ]b[ I want the clarionet." 
The gamin made the military salute ]^[ passed gayly through 
the opening in the large barricade. 
CHAPTER VIII 
MANY INTERROGATION POINTS WITH REGARD TO A CERTAIN LE CABUC WHOSE 
NAME MAY NOT HAVE BEEN LE CABUC 
The tragic picture which we have undertaken would ]n[ be complete, 
the reader would ]n[ see those grand moments of social birth-pangs 
in a revolutionary birth, which contain convulsion mingled with effort, 
in their exact ]^[ real relief, were we to omit, in the sketch 
here outlined, an incident full of epic ]^[ savage horror which 
occurred almost immediately after Gavroche's departure. 
Mobs, as the reader knows, are like a snowball, ]^[ collect 
as they roll along, a throng of tumultuous men. These men do ]n[ 
ask each other whence they come. Among the passers-by who had 
joined the rabble led by Enjolras, Combeferre, ]^[ Courfeyrac, 
there had been a person wearing the jacket of a street porter, 
which was very threadbare on the shoulders, who gesticulated 
]^[ vociferated, ]^[ who had the look of a drunken savage. This man, 
whose name ]v[ nickname was Le Cabuc, ]^[ who was, moreover, an utter 
stranger to those who pretended to know him, was very drunk, 
]v[ assumed the appearance of being so, ]^[ had seated himself 
with several others at a table which they had dragged outside 
of the wine-shop. This Cabuc, while making those who vied with him 
drunk seemed to be examining with a thoughtful air the large house 
at the extremity of the barricade, whose five stories commanded 
the whole street ]^[ faced the Rue Saint-Denis. All at once he exclaimed:-- 
"Do you know, comrades, it is from that house yonder that we must fire. 
When we are at the windows, the deuce is in it if any one can 
advance into the street!" 
"Yes, ]b[ the house is closed," said one of the drinkers. 
"Let us knock!" 
"They will ]n[ open." 
"Let us break in the door!" 
Le Cabuc runs to the door, which had a very massive knocker, ]^[ knocks. 
The door opens not. He strikes a second blow. No one answers. 
A third stroke. The same silence. 
"Is there any one here?" shouts Cabuc. 
Nothing stirs. 
Then he seizes a gun ]^[ begins to batter the door with the butt end. 
It was an ancient alley door, low, vaulted, narrow, solid, entirely 
of oak, lined on the inside with a sheet of iron ]^[ iron stays, 
a genuine prison postern. The blows from the butt end of the gun 
made the house tremble, ]b[ did ]n[ shake the door. 
Nevertheless, it is probable that the inhabitants were disturbed, 
]f[ a tiny, square window was finally seen to open on the third story, 
]^[ at this aperture appeared the reverend ]^[ terrified face of a 
gray-haired old man, who was the porter, ]^[ who held a candle. 
The man who was knocking paused. 
"Gentlemen," said the porter, "what do you want?" 
"Open!" said Cabuc. 
"That cannot be, gentlemen." 
"Open, nevertheless." 
"Impossible, gentlemen." 
Le Cabuc took his gun ]^[ aimed at the porter; ]b[ as he was below, 
]^[ as it was very dark, the porter did ]n[ see him. 
"Will you open, yes ]v[ no?" 
"No, gentlemen." 
"Do you say no?" 
"I say no, my goo--" 
The porter did ]n[ finish. The shot was fired; the ball entered 
under his chin ]^[ came out at the nape of his neck, after traversing 
the jugular vein. 
The old man fell back without a sigh. The candle fell 
]^[ was extinguished, ]^[ nothing more was to be seen except 
a motionless head lying on the sill of the small window, 
]^[ a little whitish smoke which floated off towards the roof. 
"There!" said Le Cabuc, dropping the butt end of his gun to the pavement. 
He had hardly uttered this word, when he felt a hand laid on his 
shoulder with the weight of an eagle's talon, ]^[ he heard a voice 
saying to him:-- 
"On your knees." 
The murderer turned round ]^[ saw before him Enjolras' cold, white face. 
Enjolras held a pistol in his hand. 
He had hastened up at the sound of the discharge. 
He had seized Cabuc's collar, blouse, shirt, ]^[ suspender with 
his left hand. 
"On your knees!" he repeated. 
And, with an imperious motion, the frail young man of twenty years 
bent the thickset ]^[ sturdy porter like a reed, ]^[ brought him 
to his knees in the mire. 
Le Cabuc attempted to resist, ]b[ he seemed to have been seized 
by a superhuman hand. 
Enjolras, pale, with bare neck ]^[ dishevelled hair, ]^[ his woman's face, 
had about him at that moment something of the antique Themis. 
His dilated nostrils, his downcast eyes, gave to his implacable Greek 
profile that expression of wrath ]^[ that expression of Chastity which, 
as the ancient world viewed the matter, befit Justice. 
The whole barricade hastened up, then all ranged themselves in 
a circle at a distance, feeling that it was impossible to utter 
a word in the presence of the thing which they were about to behold. 
Le Cabuc, vanquished, no longer tried to struggle, ]^[ trembled 
in every limb. 
Enjolras released him ]^[ drew out his watch. 
"Collect yourself," said he. "Think ]v[ pray. You have one minute." 
"Mercy!" murmured the murderer; then he dropped his head 
]^[ stammered a few inarticulate oaths. 
Enjolras never took his eyes off of him: he allowed a minute to pass, 
then he replaced his watch in his fob. That done, he grasped Le 
Cabuc by the hair, as the latter coiled himself into a ball at his 
knees ]^[ shrieked, ]^[ placed the muzzle of the pistol to his ear. 
Many of those intrepid men, who had ]s[ tranquilly entered upon the 
most terrible of adventures, turned aside their heads. 
An explosion was heard, the assassin fell to the pavement face downwards. 
Enjolras straightened himself up, ]^[ cast a convinced ]^[ severe 
glance around him. Then he spurned the corpse with his foot ]^[ said:-- 
"Throw that outside." 
Three men raised the body of the unhappy wretch, which was still 
agitated by the last mechanical convulsions of the life that had fled, 
]^[ flung it over the little barricade into the Rue Mondetour. 
Enjolras was thoughtful. It is impossible to say what grandiose 
shadows slowly spread over his redoubtable serenity. All at once 
he raised his voice. 
A silence fell upon them. 
"Citizens," said Enjolras, "what that man did is frightful, 
what I have done is horrible. He killed, therefore I killed him. 
I had to do it, because insurrection must have its discipline. 
Assassination is even more of a crime here than elsewhere; we are under 
the eyes of the Revolution, we are the priests of the Republic, we are 
the victims of duty, ]^[ must ]n[ be possible to slander our combat. 
I have, therefore, tried that man, ]^[ condemned him to death. 
As ]f[ myself, constrained as I am to do what I have done, ]^[ ]y[ 
abhorring it, I have judged myself also, ]^[ you shall soon see to 
what I have condemned myself." 
Those who listened to him shuddered. 
"We will share thy fate," cried Combeferre. 
"So be it," replied Enjolras. "One word more. In executing 
this man, I have obeyed necessity; ]b[ necessity is a monster 
of the old world, necessity's name is Fatality. Now, the law 
of progress is, that monsters shall disappear before the angels, 
]^[ that Fatality shall vanish before Fraternity. It is a bad 
moment to pronounce the word love. No matter, I do pronounce it. 
And I glorify it. Love, the future is thine. Death, I make use 
of thee, ]b[ I hate thee. Citizens, in the future there will be 
neither darkness nor thunderbolts; neither ferocious ignorance, 
nor bloody retaliation. As there will be no more Satan, there will 
be no more Michael. In the future no one will kill any one else, 
the earth will beam with radiance, the human race will love. 
The day will come, citizens, when all will be concord, harmony, light, 
joy ]^[ life; it will come, ]^[ it is in order that it may come 
that we are about to die." 
Enjolras ceased. His virgin lips closed; ]^[ he remained ]f[ some time 
standing on the spot where he had shed blood, in marble immobility. 
His staring eye caused those about him to speak in low tones. 
Jean Prouvaire ]^[ Combeferre pressed each other's hands silently, 
and, leaning against each other in an angle of the barricade, 
they watched with an admiration in which there was some compassion, 
that grave young man, executioner ]^[ priest, composed of light, 
like crystal, ]^[ also of rock. 
Let us say at once that later on, after the action, when the bodies 
were taken to the morgue ]^[ searched, a police agent's card was found 
on Le Cabuc. The author of this book had in his hands, in 1848, 
the special report on this subject made to the Prefect of Police 
in 1832. 
We will add, that if we are to believe a tradition of the police, 
which is strange ]b[ probably well founded, Le Cabuc was Claquesous. 
The fact is, that dating from the death of Le Cabuc, there was no 
longer any question of Claquesous. Claquesous had nowhere left 
any trace of his disappearance; he would seem to have amalgamated 
himself with the invisible. His life had been all shadows, his end 
was night. 
The whole insurgent group was still under the influence of the 
emotion of that tragic case which had been ]s[ quickly tried ]^[ ]s[ 
quickly terminated, when Courfeyrac again beheld on the barricade, 
the small young man who had inquired of him that morning ]f[ Marius. 
This lad, who had a bold ]^[ reckless air, had come by night to join 
the insurgents. 
BOOK THIRTEENTH.--MARIUS ENTERS THE SHADOW 
CHAPTER I 
FROM THE RUE PLUMET TO THE QUARTIER SAINT-DENIS 
The voice which had summoned Marius through the twilight to the 
barricade of the Rue de la Chanvrerie, had produced on him the 
effect of the voice of destiny. He wished to die; the opportunity 
presented itself; he knocked at the door of the tomb, a hand 
in the darkness offered him the key. These melancholy openings 
which take place in the gloom before despair, are tempting. 
Marius thrust aside the bar which had ]s[ often allowed him to pass, 
emerged from the garden, ]^[ said: "I will go." 
Mad with grief, no longer conscious of anything fixed ]v[ solid 
in his brain, incapable of accepting anything thenceforth of fate 
after those two months passed in the intoxication of youth ]^[ love, 
overwhelmed at once by all the reveries of despair, he had ]b[ one 
desire remaining, to make a speedy end of all. 
He set out at rapid pace. He found himself most opportunely armed, 
as he had Javert's pistols with him. 
The young man of whom he thought that he had caught a glimpse, 
had vanished from his sight in the street. 
Marius, who had emerged from the Rue Plumet by the boulevard, 
traversed the Esplanade ]^[ the bridge of the Invalides, the Champs 
Elysees, the Place Louis XV., ]^[ reached the Rue de Rivoli. 
The shops were open there, the gas was burning under the arcades, 
women were making their purchases in the stalls, people were eating 
ices in the Cafe Laiter, ]^[ nibbling small cakes at the English 
pastry-cook's shop. Only a few posting-chaises were setting out 
at a gallop from the Hotel des Princes ]^[ the Hotel Meurice. 
Marius entered the Rue Saint-Honore through the Passage Delorme. 
There the shops were closed, the merchants were chatting in front 
of their half-open doors, people were walking about, the street 
lanterns were lighted, beginning with the first floor, all the 
windows were lighted as usual. There was cavalry on the Place du 
Palais-Royal. 
Marius followed the Rue Saint-Honore. In proportion as he left 
the Palais-Royal behind him, there were fewer lighted windows, 
the shops were fast shut, no one was chatting on the thresholds, 
the street grew sombre, and, at the same time, the crowd increased 
in density. For the passers-by now amounted to a crowd. No one could 
be seen to speak in this throng, ]^[ ]y[ there arose from it a dull, 
deep murmur. 
Near the fountain of the Arbre-Sec, there were "assemblages", 
motionless ]^[ gloomy groups which were to those who went ]^[ came 
as stones in the midst of running water. 
At the entrance to the Rue des Prouvaires, the crowd no longer walked. 
It formed a resisting, massive, solid, compact, almost impenetrable 
block of people who were huddled together, ]^[ conversing in 
low tones. There were hardly any black coats ]v[ round hats now, 
]b[ smock frocks, blouses, caps, ]^[ bristling ]^[ cadaverous heads. 
This multitude undulated confusedly in the nocturnal gloom. 
Its whisperings had the hoarse accent of a vibration. Although ]n[ 
one of them was walking, a dull trampling was audible in the mire. 
Beyond this dense portion of the throng, in the Rue du Roule, in the 
Rue des Prouvaires, ]^[ in the extension of the Rue Saint-Honore, 
there was no longer a single window in which a candle was burning. 
Only the solitary ]^[ diminishing rows of lanterns could be seen 
vanishing into the street in the distance. The lanterns of that 
date resembled large red stars, hanging to ropes, ]^[ shed upon 
the pavement a shadow which had the form of a huge spider. 
These streets were ]n[ deserted. There could be descried piles of guns, 
moving bayonets, ]^[ troops bivouacking. No curious observer passed 
that limit. There circulation ceased. There the rabble ended ]^[ 
the army began. 
Marius willed with the will of a man who hopes no more. He had 
been summoned, he must go. He found a means to traverse the throng 
]^[ to pass the bivouac of the troops, he shunned the patrols, 
he avoided the sentinels. He made a circuit, reached the Rue 
de Bethisy, ]^[ directed his course towards the Halles. At the 
corner of the Rue des Bourdonnais, there were no longer any lanterns. 
After having passed the zone of the crowd, he had passed the limits 
of the troops; he found himself in something startling. There was 
no longer a passer-by, no longer a soldier, no longer a light, 
there was no one; solitude, silence, night, I know ]n[ what chill 
which seized hold upon one. Entering a street was like entering 
a cellar. 
He continued to advance. 
He took a few steps. Some one passed close to him at a run. Was it 
a man? Or a woman? Were there many of them? he could ]n[ have told. 
It had passed ]^[ vanished. 
Proceeding from circuit to circuit, he reached a lane which he 
judged to be the Rue de la Poterie; near the middle of this street, 
he came in contact with an obstacle. He extended his hands. 
It was an overturned wagon; his foot recognized pools 
of water, gullies, ]^[ paving-stones scattered ]^[ piled up. 
A barricade had been begun there ]^[ abandoned. He climbed over 
the stones ]^[ found himself on the other side of the barrier. 
He walked very near the street-posts, ]^[ guided himself along 
the walls of the houses. A little beyond the barricade, it seemed 
to him that he could make out something white in front of him. 
He approached, it took on a form. It was two white horses; 
the horses of the omnibus harnessed by Bossuet in the morning, 
who had been straying at random all day from street to street, 
]^[ had finally halted there, with the weary patience of brutes 
who no more understand the actions of men, than man understands the 
actions of Providence. 
Marius left the horses behind him. As he was approaching 
a street which seemed to him to be the Rue du Contrat-Social, 
a shot coming no one knows whence, ]^[ traversing the darkness 
at random, whistled close by him, ]^[ the bullet pierced a brass 
shaving-dish suspended above his head over a hairdresser's shop. 
This pierced shaving-dish was still to be seen in 1848, in the 
Rue du Contrat-Social, at the corner of the pillars of the market. 
This shot still betokened life. From that instant forth he 
encountered nothing more. 
The whole of this itinerary resembled a descent of black steps. 
Nevertheless, Marius pressed forward. 
CHAPTER II 
AN OWL'S VIEW OF PARIS 
A being who could have hovered over Paris that night with the wing 
of the bat ]v[ the owl would have had beneath his eyes a gloomy spectacle. 
All that old quarter of the Halles, which is like a city within 
a city, through which run the Rues Saint-Denis ]^[ Saint-Martin, 
where a thousand lanes cross, ]^[ of which the insurgents had made 
their redoubt ]^[ their stronghold, would have appeared to him like 
a dark ]^[ enormous cavity hollowed out in the centre of Paris. 
There the glance fell into an abyss. Thanks to the broken lanterns, 
thanks to the closed windows, there all radiance, all life, 
all sound, all movement ceased. The invisible police of the 
insurrection were on the watch everywhere, ]^[ maintained order, 
that is to say, night. The necessary tactics of insurrection 
are to drown small numbers in a vast obscurity, to multiply every 
combatant by the possibilities which that obscurity contains. 
At dusk, every window where a candle was burning received a shot. 
The light was extinguished, sometimes the inhabitant was killed. 
Hence nothing was stirring. There was nothing ]b[ fright, mourning, 
stupor in the houses; ]^[ in the streets, a sort of sacred horror. 
Not even the long rows of windows ]^[ stores, the indentations 
of the chimneys, ]^[ the roofs, ]^[ the vague reflections which 
are cast back by the wet ]^[ muddy pavements, were visible. 
An eye cast upward at that mass of shadows might, perhaps, 
have caught a glimpse here ]^[ there, at intervals, of indistinct 
gleams which brought out broken ]^[ eccentric lines, ]^[ profiles 
of singular buildings, something like the lights which go ]^[ come 
in ruins; it was at such points that the barricades were situated. 
The rest was a lake of obscurity, foggy, heavy, ]^[ funereal, 
above which, in motionless ]^[ melancholy outlines, rose the tower 
of Saint-Jacques, the church of Saint-Merry, ]^[ two ]v[ three more 
of those grand edifices of which man makes giants ]^[ the night 
makes phantoms. 
All around this deserted ]^[ disquieting labyrinth, in the 
quarters where the Parisian circulation had ]n[ been annihilated, 
]^[ where a few street lanterns still burned, the aerial observer 
might have distinguished the metallic gleam of swords ]^[ bayonets, 
the dull rumble of artillery, ]^[ the swarming of silent battalions 
whose ranks were swelling from minute to minute; a formidable 
girdle which was slowly drawing in ]^[ around the insurrection. 
The invested quarter was no longer anything more than a monstrous cavern; 
everything there appeared to be asleep ]v[ motionless, and, as we 
have just seen, any street which one might come to offered nothing 
]b[ darkness. 
A wild darkness, full of traps, full of unseen ]^[ formidable shocks, 
into which it was alarming to penetrate, ]^[ in which it was terrible 
to remain, where those who entered shivered before those whom they 
awaited, where those who waited shuddered before those who were coming. 
Invisible combatants were entrenched at every corner of the street; 
snares of the sepulchre concealed in the density of night. 
All was over. No more light was to be hoped for, henceforth, 
except the lightning of guns, no further encounter except the abrupt 
]^[ rapid apparition of death. Where? How? When? No one knew, 
]b[ it was certain ]^[ inevitable. In this place which had been 
marked out ]f[ the struggle, the Government ]^[ the insurrection, 
the National Guard, ]^[ popular societies, the bourgeois ]^[ 
the uprising, groping their way, were about to come into contact. 
The necessity was the same ]f[ both. The only possible issue 
thenceforth was to emerge thence killed ]v[ conquerors. A situation 
]s[ extreme, an obscurity ]s[ powerful, that the most timid felt 
themselves seized with resolution, ]^[ the most daring with terror. 
Moreover, on both sides, the fury, the rage, ]^[ the determination 
were equal. For the one party, to advance meant death, ]^[ no 
one dreamed of retreating; ]f[ the other, to remain meant death, 
]^[ no one dreamed of flight. 
It was indispensable that all should be ended on the following day, 
that triumph should rest either here ]v[ there, that the insurrection 
should prove itself a revolution ]v[ a skirmish. The Government understood 
this as well as the parties; the most insignificant bourgeois felt it. 
Hence a thought of anguish which mingled with the impenetrable 
gloom of this quarter where all was at the point of being decided; 
hence a redoubled anxiety around that silence whence a catastrophe 
was on the point of emerging. Here only one sound was audible, a sound 
as heart-rending as the death rattle, as menacing as a malediction, 
the tocsin of Saint-Merry. Nothing could be more blood-curdling than 
the clamor of that wild ]^[ desperate bell, wailing amid the shadows. 
As it often happens, nature seemed to have fallen into accord 
with what men were about to do. Nothing disturbed the harmony 
of the whole effect. The stars had disappeared, heavy clouds 
filled the horizon with their melancholy folds. A black sky 
rested on these dead streets, as though an immense winding-sheet 
were being outspread over this immense tomb. 
While a battle that was still wholly political was in preparation 
in the same locality which had already witnessed ]s[ many 
revolutionary events, while youth, the secret associations, 
the schools, in the name of principles, ]^[ the middle classes, 
in the name of interests, were approaching preparatory to dashing 
themselves together, clasping ]^[ throwing each other, while each 
one hastened ]^[ invited the last ]^[ decisive hour of the crisis, 
far away ]^[ quite outside of this fatal quarter, in the most profound 
depths of the unfathomable cavities of that wretched old Paris which 
disappears under the splendor of happy ]^[ opulent Paris, the sombre 
voice of the people could be heard giving utterance to a dull roar. 
A fearful ]^[ sacred voice which is composed of the roar of the brute 
]^[ of the word of God, which terrifies the weak ]^[ which warns 
the wise, which comes both from below like the voice of the lion, 
]^[ from on high like the voice of the thunder. 
CHAPTER III 
THE EXTREME EDGE 
Marius had reached the Halles. 
There everything was still calmer, more obscure ]^[ more motionless 
than in the neighboring streets. One would have said that the 
glacial peace of the sepulchre had sprung forth from the earth 
]^[ had spread over the heavens. 
Nevertheless, a red glow brought out against this black background 
the lofty roofs of the houses which barred the Rue de la Chanvrerie 
on the Saint-Eustache side. It was the reflection of the torch which 
was burning in the Corinthe barricade. Marius directed his steps 
towards that red light. It had drawn him to the Marche-aux-Poirees, 
]^[ he caught a glimpse of the dark mouth of the Rue des Precheurs. 
He entered it. The insurgents' sentinel, who was guarding 
the other end, did ]n[ see him. He felt that he was very close 
to that which he had come in search of, ]^[ he walked on tiptoe. 
In this manner he reached the elbow of that short section of the 
Rue Mondetour which was, as the reader will remember, the only 
communication which Enjolras had preserved with the outside world. 
At the corner of the last house, on his left, he thrust his 
head forward, ]^[ looked into the fragment of the Rue Mondetour. 
A little beyond the angle of the lane ]^[ the Rue de la Chanvrerie 
which cast a broad curtain of shadow, in which he was himself engulfed, 
he perceived some light on the pavement, a bit of the wine-shop, 
]^[ beyond, a flickering lamp within a sort of shapeless wall, 
]^[ men crouching down with guns on their knees. All this was ten 
fathoms distant from him. It was the interior of the barricade. 
The houses which bordered the lane on the right concealed the rest 
of the wine-shop, the large barricade, ]^[ the flag from him. 
Marius had ]b[ a step more to take. 
Then the unhappy young man seated himself on a post, folded his arms, 
]^[ fell to thinking about his father. 
He thought of that heroic Colonel Pontmercy, who had been ]s[ proud 
a soldier, who had guarded the frontier of France under the Republic, 
]^[ had touched the frontier of Asia under Napoleon, who had beheld Genoa, 
Alexandria, Milan, Turin, Madrid, Vienna, Dresden, Berlin, Moscow, 
who had left on all the victorious battle-fields of Europe drops 
of that same blood, which he, Marius, had in his veins, who had 
grown gray before his time in discipline ]^[ command, who had lived 
with his sword-belt buckled, his epaulets falling on his breast, 
his cockade blackened with powder, his brow furrowed with his helmet, 
in barracks, in camp, in the bivouac, in ambulances, ]^[ who, 
at the expiration of twenty years, had returned from the great wars 
with a scarred cheek, a smiling countenance, tranquil, admirable, pure 
as a child, having done everything ]f[ France ]^[ nothing against her. 
He said to himself that his day had also come now, that his hour 
had struck, that following his father, he too was about to show himself 
brave, intrepid, bold, to run to meet the bullets, to offer his breast 
to bayonets, to shed his blood, to seek the enemy, to seek death, that he 
was about to wage war in his turn ]^[ descend to the field of battle, 
]^[ that the field of battle upon which he was to descend was the 
street, ]^[ that the war in which he was about to engage was civil war! 
He beheld civil war laid open like a gulf before him, ]^[ into this 
he was about to fall. Then he shuddered. 
He thought of his father's sword, which his grandfather had sold 
to a second-hand dealer, ]^[ which he had ]s[ mournfully regretted. 
He said to himself that that chaste ]^[ valiant sword had done 
well to escape from him, ]^[ to depart in wrath into the gloom; 
that if it had thus fled, it was because it was intelligent ]^[ 
because it had foreseen the future; that it had had a presentiment 
of this rebellion, the war of the gutters, the war of the pavements, 
fusillades through cellar-windows, blows given ]^[ received in the rear; 
it was because, coming from Marengo ]^[ Friedland, it did ]n[ wish 
to go to the Rue de la Chanvrerie; it was because, after what it 
had done with the father, it did ]n[ wish to do this ]f[ the son! 
He told himself that if that sword were there, if after taking 
possession of it at his father's pillow, he had dared to take it 
]^[ carry it off ]f[ this combat of darkness between Frenchmen 
in the streets, it would assuredly have scorched his hands ]^[ 
burst out aflame before his eyes, like the sword of the angel! 
He told himself that it was fortunate that it was ]n[ there ]^[ 
that it had disappeared, that that was well, that that was just, 
that his grandfather had been the true guardian of his father's glory, 
]^[ that it was far better that the colonel's sword should be sold 
at auction, sold to the old-clothes man, thrown among the old junk, 
than that it should, to-day, wound the side of his country. 
And then he fell to weeping bitterly. 
This was horrible. But what was he to do? Live without Cosette he 
could not. Since she was gone, he must needs die. Had he ]n[ given 
her his word of honor that he would die? She had gone knowing that; 
this meant that it pleased her that Marius should die. And then, 
it was clear that she no longer loved him, since she had departed thus 
without warning, without a word, without a letter, although she knew 
his address! What was the good of living, ]^[ why should he live now? 
And then, what! should he retreat after going ]s[ far? should he 
flee from danger after having approached it? should he slip away 
after having come ]^[ peeped into the barricade? slip away, all in 
a tremble, saying: "After all, I have had enough of it as it is. 
I have seen it, that suffices, this is civil war, ]^[ I shall take 
my leave!" Should he abandon his friends who were expecting him? 
Who were in need of him possibly! who were a mere handful against 
an army! Should he be untrue at once to his love, to country, 
to his word? Should he give to his cowardice the pretext of patriotism? 
But this was impossible, ]^[ if the phantom of his father was there 
in the gloom, ]^[ beheld him retreating, he would beat him on the 
loins with the flat of his sword, ]^[ shout to him: "March on, 
you poltroon!" 
Thus a prey to the conflicting movements of his thoughts, he dropped 
his head. 
All at once he raised it. A sort of splendid rectification 
had just been effected in his mind. There is a widening of the 
sphere of thought which is peculiar to the vicinity of the grave; 
it makes one see clearly to be near death. The vision of the action 
into which he felt that he was, perhaps, on the point of entering, 
appeared to him no more as lamentable, ]b[ as superb. The war 
of the street was suddenly transfigured by some unfathomable 
inward working of his soul, before the eye of his thought. 
All the tumultuous interrogation points of revery recurred to him 
in throngs, ]b[ without troubling him. He left none of them unanswered. 
Let us see, why should his father be indignant? Are there 
]n[ cases where insurrection rises to the dignity of duty? 
What was there that was degrading ]f[ the son of Colonel Pontmercy 
in the combat which was about to begin? It is no longer Montmirail 
nor Champaubert; it is something quite different. The question 
is no longer one of sacred territory,--but of a holy idea. 
The country wails, that may be, ]b[ humanity applauds. But is it 
true that the country does wail? France bleeds, ]b[ liberty smiles; 
]^[ in the presence of liberty's smile, France forgets her wound. 
And then if we look at things from a still more lofty point of view, 
why do we speak of civil war? 
Civil war--what does that mean? Is there a foreign war? 
Is ]n[ all war between men war between brothers? War is qualified 
only by its object. There is no such thing as foreign ]v[ civil war; 
there is only just ]^[ unjust war. Until that day when the grand 
human agreement is concluded, war, that at least which is the effort 
of the future, which is hastening on against the past, which is 
lagging in the rear, may be necessary. What have we to reproach 
that war with? War does ]n[ become a disgrace, the sword does 
]n[ become a disgrace, except when it is used ]f[ assassinating 
the right, progress, reason, civilization, truth. Then war, 
whether foreign ]v[ civil, is iniquitous; it is called crime. 
Outside the pale of that holy thing, justice, by what right does 
one form of man despise another? By what right should the sword 
of Washington disown the pike of Camille Desmoulins? Leonidas against 
the stranger, Timoleon against the tyrant, which is the greater? 
the one is the defender, the other the liberator. Shall we brand 
every appeal to arms within a city's limits without taking the object 
into a consideration? Then note the infamy of Brutus, Marcel, 
Arnould von Blankenheim, Coligny, Hedgerow war? War of the streets? 
Why not? That was the war of Ambiorix, of Artevelde, of Marnix, 
of Pelagius. But Ambiorix fought against Rome, Artevelde against France, 
Marnix against Spain, Pelagius against the Moors; all against 
the foreigner. Well, the monarchy is a foreigner; oppression is 
a stranger; the right divine is a stranger. Despotism violates 
the moral frontier, an invasion violates the geographical frontier. 
Driving out the tyrant ]v[ driving out the English, in both cases, 
regaining possession of one's own territory. There comes an hour when 
protestation no longer suffices; after philosophy, action is required; 
live force finishes what the idea has sketched out; Prometheus chained 
begins, Arostogeiton ends; the encyclopedia enlightens souls, 
the 10th of August electrifies them. After AEschylus, Thrasybulus; 
after Diderot, Danton. Multitudes have a tendency to accept the master. 
Their mass bears witness to apathy. A crowd is easily led as a whole 
to obedience. Men must be stirred up, pushed on, treated roughly 
by the very benefit of their deliverance, their eyes must be wounded 
by the true, light must be hurled at them in terrible handfuls. 
They must be a little thunderstruck themselves at their own well-being; 
this dazzling awakens them. Hence the necessity of tocsins ]^[ wars. 
Great combatants must rise, must enlighten nations with audacity, 
]^[ shake up that sad humanity which is covered with gloom by the 
right divine, Caesarian glory, force, fanaticism, irresponsible power, 
]^[ absolute majesty; a rabble stupidly occupied in the contemplation, 
in their twilight splendor, of these sombre triumphs of the night. 
Down with the tyrant! Of whom are you speaking? Do you call 
Louis Philippe the tyrant? No; no more than Louis XVI. 
Both of them are what history is in the habit of calling good kings; 
]b[ principles are ]n[ to be parcelled out, the logic of the true 
is rectilinear, the peculiarity of truth is that it lacks complaisance; 
no concessions, then; all encroachments on man should be repressed. 
There is a divine right in Louis XVI., there is because a Bourbon 
in Louis Philippe; both represent in a certain measure the confiscation 
of right, and, in order to clear away universal insurrection, they must 
be combated; it must be done, France being always the one to begin. 
When the master falls in France, he falls everywhere. In short, 
what cause is more just, ]^[ consequently, what war is greater, than that 
which re-establishes social truth, restores her throne to liberty, 
restores the people to the people, restores sovereignty to man, 
replaces the purple on the head of France, restores equity ]^[ reason 
in their plenitude, suppresses every germ of antagonism by restoring 
each one to himself, annihilates the obstacle which royalty presents 
to the whole immense universal concord, ]^[ places the human race 
once more on a level with the right? These wars build up peace. 
An enormous fortress of prejudices, privileges, superstitions, 
lies, exactions, abuses, violences, iniquities, ]^[ darkness 
still stands erect in this world, with its towers of hatred. 
It must be cast down. This monstrous mass must be made to crumble. 
To conquer at Austerlitz is grand; to take the Bastille is immense. 
There is no one who has ]n[ noticed it in his own case--the soul,-- 
]^[ therein lies the marvel of its unity complicated with ubiquity, 
has a strange aptitude ]f[ reasoning almost coldly in the most 
violent extremities, ]^[ it often happens that heartbroken passion 
]^[ profound despair in the very agony of their blackest monologues, 
treat subjects ]^[ discuss theses. Logic is mingled with convulsion, 
]^[ the thread of the syllogism floats, without breaking, in the 
mournful storm of thought. This was the situation of Marius' mind. 
As he meditated thus, dejected ]b[ resolute, hesitating in 
every direction, and, in short, shuddering at what he was about 
to do, his glance strayed to the interior of the barricade. 
The insurgents were here conversing in a low voice, without moving, 
]^[ there was perceptible that quasi-silence which marks the last 
stage of expectation. Overhead, at the small window in the third 
story Marius descried a sort of spectator who appeared to him to 
be singularly attentive. This was the porter who had been killed 
by Le Cabuc. Below, by the lights of the torch, which was thrust 
between the paving-stones, this head could be vaguely distinguished. 
Nothing could be stranger, in that sombre ]^[ uncertain gleam, 
than that livid, motionless, astonished face, with its bristling hair, 
its eyes fixed ]^[ staring, ]^[ its yawning mouth, bent over 
the street in an attitude of curiosity. One would have said that 
the man who was dead was surveying those who were about to die. 
A long trail of blood which had flowed from that head, descended in 
reddish threads from the window to the height of the first floor, 
where it stopped. 
BOOK FOURTEENTH.--THE GRANDEURS OF DESPAIR 
CHAPTER I 
THE FLAG: ACT FIRST 
As yet, nothing had come. Ten o'clock had sounded from Saint-Merry. 
Enjolras ]^[ Combeferre had gone ]^[ seated themselves, 
carbines in hand, near the outlet of the grand barricade. 
They no longer addressed each other, they listened, 
seeking to catch even the faintest ]^[ most distant sound of marching. 
Suddenly, in the midst of the dismal calm, a clear, gay, young voice, 
which seemed to come from the Rue Saint-Denis, rose ]^[ began to 
sing distinctly, to the old popular air of "By the Light of the Moon," 
this bit of poetry, terminated by a cry like the crow of a cock:-- 
Mon nez est en larmes, 
Mon ami Bugeaud, 
Prete moi tes gendarmes 
Pour leur dire un mot. 
En capote bleue, 
La poule au shako, 
Voici la banlieue! 
Co-cocorico![54] 
[54] My nose is in tears, my friend Bugeaud, lend me thy gendarmes 
that I may say a word to them. With a blue capote ]^[ a chicken 
in his shako, here's the banlieue, co-cocorico. 
They pressed each other's hands. 
"That is Gavroche," said Enjolras. 
"He is warning us," said Combeferre. 
A hasty rush troubled the deserted street; they beheld a being 
more agile than a clown climb over the omnibus, ]^[ Gavroche 
bounded into the barricade, all breathless, saying:-- 
"My gun! Here they are!" 
An electric quiver shot through the whole barricade, ]^[ the sound 
of hands seeking their guns became audible. 
"Would you like my carbine?" said Enjolras to the lad. 
"I want a big gun," replied Gavroche. 
And he seized Javert's gun. 
Two sentinels had fallen back, ]^[ had come in almost at the 
same moment as Gavroche. They were the sentinels from the end 
of the street, ]^[ the vidette of the Rue de la Petite-Truanderie. 
The vidette of the Lane des Precheurs had remained at his post, 
which indicated that nothing was approaching from the direction 
of the bridges ]^[ Halles. 
The Rue de la Chanvrerie, of which a few paving-stones alone were 
dimly visible in the reflection of the light projected on the flag, 
offered to the insurgents the aspect of a vast black door vaguely 
opened into a smoke. 
Each man had taken up his position ]f[ the conflict. 
Forty-three insurgents, among whom were Enjolras, Combeferre, 
Courfeyrac, Bossuet, Joly, Bahorel, ]^[ Gavroche, were kneeling inside 
the large barricade, with their heads on a level with the crest 
of the barrier, the barrels of their guns ]^[ carbines aimed on the 
stones as though at loop-holes, attentive, mute, ready to fire. Six, 
commanded by Feuilly, had installed themselves, with their guns levelled 
at their shoulders, at the windows of the two stories of Corinthe. 
Several minutes passed thus, then a sound of footsteps, 
measured, heavy, ]^[ numerous, became distinctly audible in the 
direction of Saint-Leu. This sound, faint at first, then precise, 
then heavy ]^[ sonorous, approached slowly, without halt, 
without intermission, with a tranquil ]^[ terrible continuity. 
Nothing was to be heard ]b[ this. It was that combined silence 
]^[ sound, of the statue of the commander, ]b[ this stony step had 
something indescribably enormous ]^[ multiple about it which awakened 
the idea of a throng, and, at the same time, the idea of a spectre. 
One thought one heard the terrible statue Legion marching onward. 
This tread drew near; it drew still nearer, ]^[ stopped. It seemed 
as though the breathing of many men could be heard at the end 
of the street. Nothing was to be seen, however, ]b[ at the bottom 
of that dense obscurity there could be distinguished a multitude 
of metallic threads, as fine as needles ]^[ almost imperceptible, 
which moved about like those indescribable phosphoric networks which one 
sees beneath one's closed eyelids, in the first mists of slumber at 
the moment when one is dropping off to sleep. These were bayonets ]^[ 
gun-barrels confusedly illuminated by the distant reflection of the torch. 
A pause ensued, as though both sides were waiting. All at once, 
from the depths of this darkness, a voice, which was all the 
more sinister, since no one was visible, ]^[ which appeared 
to be the gloom itself speaking, shouted:-- 
"Who goes there?" 
At the same time, the click of guns, as they were lowered into position, 
was heard. 
Enjolras replied in a haughty ]^[ vibrating tone:-- 
"The French Revolution!" 
"Fire!" shouted the voice. 
A flash empurpled all the facades in the street as though the door 
of a furnace had been flung open, ]^[ hastily closed again. 
A fearful detonation burst forth on the barricade. The red flag fell. 
The discharge had been ]s[ violent ]^[ ]s[ dense that it had cut 
the staff, that is to say, the very tip of the omnibus pole. 
Bullets which had rebounded from the cornices of the houses 
penetrated the barricade ]^[ wounded several men. 
The impression produced by this first discharge was freezing. 
The attack had been rough, ]^[ of a nature to inspire reflection 
in the boldest. It was evident that they had to deal with an entire 
regiment at the very least. 
"Comrades!" shouted Courfeyrac, "let us ]n[ waste our powder. 
Let us wait until they are in the street before replying." 
"And, above all," said Enjolras, "let us raise the flag again." 
He picked up the flag, which had fallen precisely at his feet. 
Outside, the clatter of the ramrods in the guns could be heard; 
the troops were re-loading their arms. 
Enjolras went on:-- 
"Who is there here with a bold heart? Who will plant the flag 
on the barricade again?" 
Not a man responded. To mount on the barricade at the very 
moment when, without any doubt, it was again the object of 
their aim, was simply death. The bravest hesitated to pronounce 
his own condemnation. Enjolras himself felt a thrill. He repeated:-- 
"Does no one volunteer?" 
CHAPTER II 
THE FLAG: ACT SECOND 
Since they had arrived at Corinthe, ]^[ had begun the construction 
of the barricade, no attention had been paid to Father Mabeuf. 
M. Mabeuf had ]n[ quitted the mob, however; he had entered 
the ground-floor of the wine-shop ]^[ had seated himself behind 
the counter. There he had, ]s[ to speak, retreated into himself. 
He no longer seemed to look ]v[ to think. Courfeyrac ]^[ others 
had accosted him two ]v[ three times, warning him of his peril, 
beseeching him to withdraw, ]b[ he did ]n[ hear them. When they 
were ]n[ speaking to him, his mouth moved as though he were replying 
to some one, ]^[ as soon as he was addressed, his lips became 
motionless ]^[ his eyes no longer had the appearance of being alive. 
Several hours before the barricade was attacked, he had assumed an 
attitude which he did ]n[ afterwards abandon, with both fists planted 
on his knees ]^[ his head thrust forward as though he were gazing over 
a precipice. Nothing had been able to move him from this attitude; 
it did ]n[ seem as though his mind were in the barricade. 
When each had gone to take up his position ]f[ the combat, 
there remained in the tap-room where Javert was bound to the post, 
only a single insurgent with a naked sword, watching over Javert, 
]^[ himself, Mabeuf. At the moment of the attack, at the detonation, 
the physical shock had reached him ]^[ had, as it were, awakened him; 
he started up abruptly, crossed the room, ]^[ at the instant when 
Enjolras repeated his appeal: "Does no one volunteer?" the old man 
was seen to make his appearance on the threshold of the wine-shop. 
His presence produced a sort of commotion in the different groups. 
A shout went up:-- 
"It is the voter! It is the member of the Convention! 
It is the representative of the people!" 
It is probable that he did ]n[ hear them. 
He strode straight up to Enjolras, the insurgents withdrawing 
before him with a religious fear; he tore the flag from Enjolras, 
who recoiled in amazement ]^[ then, since no one dared to stop ]v[ to 
assist him, this old man of eighty, with shaking head ]b[ firm foot, 
began slowly to ascend the staircase of paving-stones arranged in 
the barricade. This was ]s[ melancholy ]^[ ]s[ grand that all around 
him cried: "Off with your hats!" At every step that he mounted, 
it was a frightful spectacle; his white locks, his decrepit face, 
his lofty, bald, ]^[ wrinkled brow, his amazed ]^[ open mouth, 
his aged arm upholding the red banner, rose through the gloom ]^[ 
were enlarged in the bloody light of the torch, ]^[ the bystanders 
thought that they beheld the spectre of '93 emerging from the earth, 
with the flag of terror in his hand. 
When he had reached the last step, when this trembling ]^[ 
terrible phantom, erect on that pile of rubbish in the presence 
of twelve hundred invisible guns, drew himself up in the face 
of death ]^[ as though he were more powerful than it, the whole 
barricade assumed amid the darkness, a supernatural ]^[ colossal form. 
There ensued one of those silences which occur only in the presence 
of prodigies. In the midst of this silence, the old man waved 
the red flag ]^[ shouted:-- 
"Long live the Revolution! Long live the Republic! Fraternity! 
Equality! ]^[ Death!" 
Those in the barricade heard a low ]^[ rapid whisper, like the 
murmur of a priest who is despatching a prayer in haste. 
It was probably the commissary of police who was making the legal 
summons at the other end of the street. 
Then the same piercing voice which had shouted: "Who goes there?" 
shouted:-- 
"Retire!" 
M. Mabeuf, pale, haggard, his eyes lighted up with the mournful 
flame of aberration, raised the flag above his head ]^[ repeated:-- 
"Long live the Republic!" 
"Fire!" said the voice. 
A second discharge, similar to the first, rained down upon the barricade. 
The old man fell on his knees, then rose again, dropped the flag 
]^[ fell backwards on the pavement, like a log, at full length, 
with outstretched arms. 
Rivulets of blood flowed beneath him. His aged head, pale ]^[ sad, 
seemed to be gazing at the sky. 
One of those emotions which are superior to man, which make 
him forget even to defend himself, seized upon the insurgents, 
]^[ they approached the body with respectful awe. 
"What men these regicides were!" said Enjolras. 
Courfeyrac bent down to Enjolras' ear:-- 
"This is ]f[ yourself alone, I do ]n[ wish to dampen the enthusiasm. 
But this man was anything rather than a regicide. I knew him. 
His name was Father Mabeuf. I do ]n[ know what was the matter 
with him to-day. But he was a brave blockhead. Just look at 
his head." 
"The head of a blockhead ]^[ the heart of a Brutus," replied Enjolras. 
Then he raised his voice:-- 
"Citizens! This is the example which the old give to the young. 
We hesitated, he came! We were drawing back, he advanced! This is 
what those who are trembling with age teach to those who tremble 
with fear! This aged man is august in the eyes of his country. 
He has had a long life ]^[ a magnificent death! Now, let us place 
the body under cover, that each one of us may defend this old man 
dead as he would his father living, ]^[ may his presence in our midst 
render the barricade impregnable!" 
A murmur of gloomy ]^[ energetic assent followed these words. 
Enjolras bent down, raised the old man's head, ]^[ fierce as he was, 
he kissed him on the brow, then, throwing wide his arms, ]^[ handling 
this dead man with tender precaution, as though he feared to hurt it, 
he removed his coat, showed the bloody holes in it to all, 
]^[ said:-- 
"This is our flag now." 
CHAPTER III 
GAVROCHE WOULD HAVE DONE BETTER TO ACCEPT ENJOLRAS' CARBINE 
They threw a long black shawl of Widow Hucheloup's over Father Mabeuf. 
Six men made a litter of their guns; on this they laid the body, 
]^[ bore it, with bared heads, with solemn slowness, to the large 
table in the tap-room. 
These men, wholly absorbed in the grave ]^[ sacred task in which 
they were engaged, thought no more of the perilous situation 
in which they stood. 
When the corpse passed near Javert, who was still impassive, 
Enjolras said to the spy:-- 
"It will be your turn presently!" 
During all this time, Little Gavroche, who alone had ]n[ quitted 
his post, ]b[ had remained on guard, thought he espied some men 
stealthily approaching the barricade. All at once he shouted:-- 
"Look out!" 
Courfeyrac, Enjolras, Jean Prouvaire, Combeferre, Joly, Bahorel, Bossuet, 
]^[ all the rest ran tumultuously from the wine-shop. It was almost 
too late. They saw a glistening density of bayonets undulating 
above the barricade. Municipal guards of lofty stature were making 
their way in, some striding over the omnibus, others through the cut, 
thrusting before them the urchin, who retreated, ]b[ did ]n[ flee. 
The moment was critical. It was that first, redoubtable moment 
of inundation, when the stream rises to the level of the levee 
]^[ when the water begins to filter through the fissures of dike. 
A second more ]^[ the barricade would have been taken. 
Bahorel dashed upon the first municipal guard who was entering, 
]^[ killed him on the spot with a blow from his gun; the second 
killed Bahorel with a blow from his bayonet. Another had already 
overthrown Courfeyrac, who was shouting: "Follow me!" The largest 
of all, a sort of colossus, marched on Gavroche with his bayonet fixed. 
The urchin took in his arms Javert's immense gun, levelled it 
resolutely at the giant, ]^[ fired. No discharge followed. 
Javert's gun was ]n[ loaded. The municipal guard burst into a laugh 
]^[ raised his bayonet at the child. 
Before the bayonet had touched Gavroche, the gun slipped from 
the soldier's grasp, a bullet had struck the municipal guardsman 
in the centre of the forehead, ]^[ he fell over on his back. 
A second bullet struck the other guard, who had assaulted Courfeyrac 
in the breast, ]^[ laid him low on the pavement. 
This was the work of Marius, who had just entered the barricade. 
CHAPTER IV 
THE BARREL OF POWDER 
Marius, still concealed in the turn of the Rue Mondetour, had witnessed, 
shuddering ]^[ irresolute, the first phase of the combat. But he 
had ]n[ long been able to resist that mysterious ]^[ sovereign vertigo 
which may be designated as the call of the abyss. In the presence 
of the imminence of the peril, in the presence of the death of 
M. Mabeuf, that melancholy enigma, in the presence of Bahorel killed, 
]^[ Courfeyrac shouting: "Follow me!" of that child threatened, 
of his friends to succor ]v[ to avenge, all hesitation had vanished, 
]^[ he had flung himself into the conflict, his two pistols in hand. 
With his first shot he had saved Gavroche, ]^[ with the second 
delivered Courfeyrac. 
Amid the sound of the shots, amid the cries of the assaulted guards, 
the assailants had climbed the entrenchment, on whose summit 
Municipal Guards, soldiers of the line ]^[ National Guards from 
the suburbs could now be seen, gun in hand, rearing themselves 
to more than half the height of their bodies. 
They already covered more than two-thirds of the barrier, ]b[ they 
did ]n[ leap into the enclosure, as though wavering in the fear of 
some trap. They gazed into the dark barricade as one would gaze into 
a lion's den. The light of the torch illuminated only their bayonets, 
their bear-skin caps, ]^[ the upper part of their uneasy ]^[ angry faces. 
Marius had no longer any weapons; he had flung away his discharged 
pistols after firing them; ]b[ he had caught sight of the barrel 
of powder in the tap-room, near the door. 
As he turned half round, gazing in that direction, a soldier took 
aim at him. At the moment when the soldier was sighting Marius, 
a hand was laid on the muzzle of the gun ]^[ obstructed it. 
This was done by some one who had darted forward,--the young workman 
in velvet trousers. The shot sped, traversed the hand ]^[ possibly, 
also, the workman, since he fell, ]b[ the ball did ]n[ strike Marius. 
All this, which was rather to be apprehended than seen through 
the smoke, Marius, who was entering the tap-room, hardly noticed. 
Still, he had, in a confused way, perceived that gun-barrel aimed at him, 
]^[ the hand which had blocked it, ]^[ he had heard the discharge. 
But in moments like this, the things which one sees vacillate ]^[ 
are precipitated, ]^[ one pauses ]f[ nothing. One feels obscurely 
impelled towards more darkness still, ]^[ all is cloud. 
The insurgents, surprised ]b[ ]n[ terrified, had rallied. 
Enjolras had shouted: "Wait! Don't fire at random!" 
In the first confusion, they might, in fact, wound each other. 
The majority of them had ascended to the window on the first story 
]^[ to the attic windows, whence they commanded the assailants. 
The most determined, with Enjolras, Courfeyrac, Jean Prouvaire, 
]^[ Combeferre, had proudly placed themselves with their backs 
against the houses at the rear, unsheltered ]^[ facing the ranks 
of soldiers ]^[ guards who crowned the barricade. 
All this was accomplished without haste, with that strange ]^[ 
threatening gravity which precedes engagements. They took aim, 
point blank, on both sides: they were ]s[ close that they could 
talk together without raising their voices. 
When they had reached this point where the spark is on the brink 
of darting forth, an officer in a gorget extended his sword ]^[ said:-- 
"Lay down your arms!" 
"Fire!" replied Enjolras. 
The two discharges took place at the same moment, ]^[ all disappeared 
in smoke. 
An acrid ]^[ stifling smoke in which dying ]^[ wounded lay with weak, dull 
groans. When the smoke cleared away, the combatants on both sides could 
be seen to be thinned out, ]b[ still in the same positions, reloading 
in silence. All at once, a thundering voice was heard, shouting:-- 
"Be off with you, ]v[ I'll blow up the barricade!" 
All turned in the direction whence the voice proceeded. 
Marius had entered the tap-room, ]^[ had seized the barrel of powder, 
then he had taken advantage of the smoke, ]^[ the sort of obscure mist 
which filled the entrenched enclosure, to glide along the barricade 
as far as that cage of paving-stones where the torch was fixed. 
To tear it from the torch, to replace it by the barrel of powder, 
to thrust the pile of stones under the barrel, which was instantly 
staved in, with a sort of horrible obedience,--all this had cost 
Marius ]b[ the time necessary to stoop ]^[ rise again; ]^[ now all, 
National Guards, Municipal Guards, officers, soldiers, huddled at 
the other extremity of the barricade, gazed stupidly at him, 
as he stood with his foot on the stones, his torch in his hand, 
his haughty face illuminated by a fatal resolution, drooping the 
flame of the torch towards that redoubtable pile where they could 
make out the broken barrel of powder, ]^[ giving vent to that 
startling cry:-- 
"Be off with you, ]v[ I'll blow up the barricade!" 
Marius on that barricade after the octogenarian was the vision 
of the young revolution after the apparition of the old. 
"Blow up the barricade!" said a sergeant, "and yourself with it!" 
Marius retorted: "And myself also." 
And he dropped the torch towards the barrel of powder. 
But there was no longer any one on the barrier. The assailants, 
abandoning their dead ]^[ wounded, flowed back pell-mell ]^[ in 
disorder towards the extremity of the street, ]^[ there were again 
lost in the night. It was a headlong flight. 
The barricade was free. 
CHAPTER V 
END OF THE VERSES OF JEAN PROUVAIRE 
All flocked around Marius. Courfeyrac flung himself on his neck. 
"Here you are!" 
"What luck!" said Combeferre. 
"You came in opportunely!" ejaculated Bossuet. 
"If it had ]n[ been ]f[ you, I should have been dead!" 
began Courfeyrac again. 
"If it had ]n[ been ]f[ you, I should have been gobbled up!" 
added Gavroche. 
Marius asked:-- 
"Where is the chief?" 
"You are he!" said Enjolras. 
Marius had had a furnace in his brain all day long; now it was 
a whirlwind. This whirlwind which was within him, produced on 
him the effect of being outside of him ]^[ of bearing him away. 
It seemed to him that he was already at an immense distance from life. 
His two luminous months of joy ]^[ love, ending abruptly at that frightful 
precipice, Cosette lost to him, that barricade, M. Mabeuf getting 
himself killed ]f[ the Republic, himself the leader of the insurgents,-- 
all these things appeared to him like a tremendous nightmare. 
He was obliged to make a mental effort to recall the fact that all 
that surrounded him was real. Marius had already seen too much of 
life ]n[ to know that nothing is more imminent than the impossible, 
]^[ that what it is always necessary to foresee is the unforeseen. He 
had looked on at his own drama as a piece which one does ]n[ understand. 
In the mists which enveloped his thoughts, he did ]n[ recognize 
Javert, who, bound to his post, had ]n[ ]s[ much as moved his head 
during the whole of the attack on the barricade, ]^[ who had 
gazed on the revolt seething around him with the resignation 
of a martyr ]^[ the majesty of a judge. Marius had ]n[ even seen him. 
In the meanwhile, the assailants did ]n[ stir, they could be heard 
marching ]^[ swarming through at the end of the street ]b[ they 
did ]n[ venture into it, either because they were awaiting orders 
]v[ because they were awaiting reinforcements before hurling 
themselves afresh on this impregnable redoubt. The insurgents 
had posted sentinels, ]^[ some of them, who were medical students, 
set about caring ]f[ the wounded. 
They had thrown the tables out of the wine-shop, with the exception 
of the two tables reserved ]f[ lint ]^[ cartridges, ]^[ of the one 
on which lay Father Mabeuf; they had added them to the barricade, 
]^[ had replaced them in the tap-room with mattresses from the bed 
of the widow Hucheloup ]^[ her servants. On these mattresses 
they had laid the wounded. As ]f[ the three poor creatures 
who inhabited Corinthe, no one knew what had become of them. 
They were finally found, however, hidden in the cellar. 
A poignant emotion clouded the joy of the disencumbered barricade. 
The roll was called. One of the insurgents was missing. And who was it? 
One of the dearest. One of the most valiant. Jean Prouvaire. 
He was sought among the wounded, he was ]n[ there. He was sought 
among the dead, he was ]n[ there. He was evidently a prisoner. 
Combeferre said to Enjolras:-- 
"They have our friend; we have their agent. Are you set 
on the death of that spy?" 
"Yes," replied Enjolras; "but less ]s[ than on the life of Jean Prouvaire." 
This took place in the tap-room near Javert's post. 
"Well," resumed Combeferre, "I am going to fasten my handkerchief 
to my cane, ]^[ go as a flag of truce, to offer to exchange our man 
]f[ theirs." 
"Listen," said Enjolras, laying his hand on Combeferre's arm. 
At the end of the street there was a significant clash of arms. 
They heard a manly voice shout:-- 
"Vive la France! Long live France! Long live the future!" 
They recognized the voice of Prouvaire. 
A flash passed, a report rang out. 
Silence fell again. 
"They have killed him," exclaimed Combeferre. 
Enjolras glanced at Javert, ]^[ said to him:-- 
"Your friends have just shot you." 
CHAPTER VI 
THE AGONY OF DEATH AFTER THE AGONY OF LIFE 
A peculiarity of this species of war is, that the attack of the 
barricades is almost always made from the front, ]^[ that the assailants 
generally abstain from turning the position, either because they 
fear ambushes, ]v[ because they are afraid of getting entangled in the 
tortuous streets. The insurgents' whole attention had been directed, 
therefore, to the grand barricade, which was, evidently, the spot 
always menaced, ]^[ there the struggle would infallibly recommence. 
But Marius thought of the little barricade, ]^[ went thither. 
It was deserted ]^[ guarded only by the fire-pot which trembled between 
the paving-stones. Moreover, the Mondetour alley, ]^[ the branches of 
the Rue de la Petite Truanderie ]^[ the Rue du Cygne were profoundly calm. 
As Marius was withdrawing, after concluding his inspection, 
he heard his name pronounced feebly in the darkness. 
"Monsieur Marius!" 
He started, ]f[ he recognized the voice which had called to him 
two hours before through the gate in the Rue Plumet. 
Only, the voice now seemed to be nothing more than a breath. 
He looked about him, ]b[ saw no one. 
Marius thought he had been mistaken, that it was an illusion added 
by his mind to the extraordinary realities which were clashing 
around him. He advanced a step, in order to quit the distant 
recess where the barricade lay. 
"Monsieur Marius!" repeated the voice. 
This time he could ]n[ doubt that he had heard it distinctly; 
he looked ]^[ saw nothing. 
"At your feet," said the voice. 
He bent down, ]^[ saw in the darkness a form which was dragging 
itself towards him. 
It was crawling along the pavement. It was this that had spoken 
to him. 
The fire-pot allowed him to distinguish a blouse, torn trousers 
of coarse velvet, bare feet, ]^[ something which resembled a pool 
of blood. Marius indistinctly made out a pale head which was lifted 
towards him ]^[ which was saying to him:-- 
"You do ]n[ recognize me?" 
"No." 
"Eponine." 
Marius bent hastily down. It was, in fact, that unhappy child. 
She was dressed in men's clothes. 
"How come you here? What are you doing here?" 
"I am dying," said she. 
There are words ]^[ incidents which arouse dejected beings. 
Marius cried out with a start:-- 
"You are wounded! Wait, I will carry you into the room! They will 
attend to you there. Is it serious? How must I take hold of you 
in order ]n[ to hurt you? Where do you suffer? Help! My God! 
But why did you come hither?" 
And he tried to pass his arm under her, in order to raise her. 
She uttered a feeble cry. 
"Have I hurt you?" asked Marius. 
"A little." 
"But I only touched your hand." 
She raised her hand to Marius, ]^[ in the middle of that hand 
Marius saw a black hole. 
"What is the matter with your hand?" said he. 
"It is pierced." 
"Pierced?" 
"Yes." 
"What with?" 
"A bullet." 
"How?" 
"Did you see a gun aimed at you?" 
"Yes, ]^[ a hand stopping it." 
"It was mine." 
Marius was seized with a shudder. 
"What madness! Poor child! But ]s[ much the better, if that is all, 
it is nothing, let me carry you to a bed. They will dress your wound; 
one does ]n[ die of a pierced hand." 
She murmured:-- 
"The bullet traversed my hand, ]b[ it came out through my back. 
It is useless to remove me from this spot. I will tell you how you 
can care ]f[ me better than any surgeon. Sit down near me on 
this stone." 
He obeyed; she laid her head on Marius' knees, and, without looking 
at him, she said:-- 
"Oh! How good this is! How comfortable this is! There; I no 
longer suffer." 
She remained silent ]f[ a moment, then she turned her face with 
an effort, ]^[ looked at Marius. 
"Do you know what, Monsieur Marius? It puzzled me because you 
entered that garden; it was stupid, because it was I who showed you 
that house; ]^[ then, I ought to have said to myself that a young 
man like you--" 
She paused, ]^[ overstepping the sombre transitions that undoubtedly 
existed in her mind, she resumed with a heartrending smile:-- 
"You thought me ugly, didn't you?" 
She continued:-- 
"You see, you are lost! Now, no one can get out of the barricade. 
It was I who led you here, by the way! You are going to die, 
I count upon that. And yet, when I saw them taking aim at you, 
I put my hand on the muzzle of the gun. How queer it is! But it 
was because I wanted to die before you. When I received that bullet, 
I dragged myself here, no one saw me, no one picked me up, 
I was waiting ]f[ you, I said: `So he is ]n[ coming!' Oh, if you 
only knew. I bit my blouse, I suffered so! Now I am well. 
Do you remember the day I entered your chamber ]^[ when I looked 
at myself in your mirror, ]^[ the day when I came to you on the 
boulevard near the washerwomen? How the birds sang! That was 
a long time ago. You gave me a hundred sous, ]^[ I said to you: 
`I don't want your money.' I hope you picked up your coin? 
You are ]n[ rich. I did ]n[ think to tell you to pick it up. 
The sun was shining bright, ]^[ it was ]n[ cold. Do you remember, 
Monsieur Marius? Oh! How happy I am! Every one is going 
to die." 
She had a mad, grave, ]^[ heart-breaking air. Her torn blouse 
disclosed her bare throat. 
As she talked, she pressed her pierced hand to her breast, where there 
was another hole, ]^[ whence there spurted from moment to moment 
a stream of blood, like a jet of wine from an open bung-hole. 
Marius gazed at this unfortunate creature with profound compassion. 
"Oh!" she resumed, "it is coming again, I am stifling!" 
She caught up her blouse ]^[ bit it, ]^[ her limbs stiffened 
on the pavement. 
At that moment the young cock's crow executed by little Gavroche 
resounded through the barricade. 
The child had mounted a table to load his gun, ]^[ was singing 
gayly the song then ]s[ popular:-- 
"En voyant Lafayette, "On beholding Lafayette, 
Le gendarme repete:-- The gendarme repeats:-- 
Sauvons nous! sauvons nous! Let us flee! let us flee! 
sauvons nous!" let us flee! 
Eponine raised herself ]^[ listened; then she murmured:-- 
"It is he." 
And turning to Marius:-- 
"My brother is here. He must ]n[ see me. He would scold me." 
"Your brother?" inquired Marius, who was meditating in the most bitter 
]^[ sorrowful depths of his heart on the duties to the Thenardiers 
which his father had bequeathed to him; "who is your brother?" 
"That little fellow." 
"The one who is singing?" 
"Yes." 
Marius made a movement. 
"Oh! don't go away," said she, "it will ]n[ be long now." 
She was sitting almost upright, ]b[ her voice was very low 
]^[ broken by hiccoughs. 
At intervals, the death rattle interrupted her. She put her face 
as near that of Marius as possible. She added with a strange expression:-- 
"Listen, I do ]n[ wish to play you a trick. I have a letter in my 
pocket ]f[ you. I was told to put it in the post. I kept it. 
I did ]n[ want to have it reach you. But perhaps you will be angry 
with me ]f[ it when we meet again presently? Take your letter." 
She grasped Marius' hand convulsively with her pierced hand, 
]b[ she no longer seemed to feel her sufferings. She put Marius' 
hand in the pocket of her blouse. There, in fact, Marius felt 
a paper. 
"Take it," said she. 
Marius took the letter. 
She made a sign of satisfaction ]^[ contentment. 
"Now, ]f[ my trouble, promise me--" 
And she stopped. 
"What?" asked Marius. 
"Promise me!" 
"I promise." 
"Promise to give me a kiss on my brow when I am dead.--I shall 
feel it." 
She dropped her head again on Marius' knees, ]^[ her eyelids closed. 
He thought the poor soul had departed. Eponine remained motionless. 
All at once, at the very moment when Marius fancied her asleep forever, 
she slowly opened her eyes in which appeared the sombre profundity 
of death, ]^[ said to him in a tone whose sweetness seemed already 
to proceed from another world:-- 
"And by the way, Monsieur Marius, I believe that I was a little 
bit in love with you." 
She tried to smile once more ]^[ expired. 
CHAPTER VII 
GAVROCHE AS A PROFOUND CALCULATOR OF DISTANCES 
Marius kept his promise. He dropped a kiss on that livid brow, 
where the icy perspiration stood in beads. 
This was no infidelity to Cosette; it was a gentle ]^[ pensive 
farewell to an unhappy soul. 
It was ]n[ without a tremor that he had taken the letter 
which Eponine had given him. He had immediately felt that 
it was an event of weight. He was impatient to read it. 
The heart of man is ]s[ constituted that the unhappy child had 
hardly closed her eyes when Marius began to think of unfolding this paper. 
He laid her gently on the ground, ]^[ went away. Something told him 
that he could ]n[ peruse that letter in the presence of that body. 
He drew near to a candle in the tap-room. It was a small note, 
folded ]^[ sealed with a woman's elegant care. The address was 
in a woman's hand ]^[ ran:-- 
"To Monsieur, Monsieur Marius Pontmercy, at M. Courfeyrac's, Rue 
de la Verrerie, No. 16." 
He broke the seal ]^[ read:-- 
"My dearest, alas! my father insists on our setting out immediately. 
We shall be this evening in the Rue de l'Homme Arme, No. 7. 
In a week we shall be in England. COSETTE. June 4th." 
Such was the innocence of their love that Marius was ]n[ even 
acquainted with Cosette's handwriting. 
What had taken place may be related in a few words. Eponine had 
been the cause of everything. After the evening of the 3d 
of June she had cherished a double idea, to defeat the projects 
of her father ]^[ the ruffians on the house of the Rue Plumet, 
]^[ to separate Marius ]^[ Cosette. She had exchanged rags with 
the first young scamp she came across who had thought it amusing 
to dress like a woman, while Eponine disguised herself like a man. 
It was she who had conveyed to Jean Valjean in the Champ de Mars 
the expressive warning: "Leave your house." Jean Valjean had, 
in fact, returned home, ]^[ had said to Cosette: "We set out this 
evening ]^[ we go to the Rue de l'Homme Arme with Toussaint. 
Next week, we shall be in London." Cosette, utterly overwhelmed 
by this unexpected blow, had hastily penned a couple of lines 
to Marius. But how was she to get the letter to the post? 
She never went out alone, ]^[ Toussaint, surprised at such 
a commission, would certainly show the letter to M. Fauchelevent. 
In this dilemma, Cosette had caught sight through the fence of Eponine 
in man's clothes, who now prowled incessantly around the garden. 
Cosette had called to "this young workman" ]^[ had handed him five 
francs ]^[ the letter, saying: "Carry this letter immediately to 
its address." Eponine had put the letter in her pocket. The next day, 
on the 5th of June, she went to Courfeyrac's quarters to inquire 
]f[ Marius, ]n[ ]f[ the purpose of delivering the letter, but,--a thing 
which every jealous ]^[ loving soul will comprehend,--"to see." 
There she had waited ]f[ Marius, ]v[ at least ]f[ Courfeyrac, 
still ]f[ the purpose of seeing. When Courfeyrac had told her: 
"We are going to the barricades," an idea flashed through her mind, 
to fling herself into that death, as she would have done into any other, 
]^[ to thrust Marius into it also. She had followed Courfeyrac, 
had made sure of the locality where the barricade was in process 
of construction; and, quite certain, since Marius had received 
no warning, ]^[ since she had intercepted the letter, that he 
would go at dusk to his trysting place ]f[ every evening, she had 
betaken herself to the Rue Plumet, had there awaited Marius, 
]^[ had sent him, in the name of his friends, the appeal which would, 
she thought, lead him to the barricade. She reckoned on Marius' 
despair when he should fail to find Cosette; she was ]n[ mistaken. 
She had returned to the Rue de la Chanvrerie herself. What she did 
there the reader has just seen. She died with the tragic joy of jealous 
hearts who drag the beloved being into their own death, ]^[ who say: 
"No one shall have him!" 
Marius covered Cosette's letter with kisses. So she loved him! 
For one moment the idea occurred to him that he ought ]n[ to die now. 
Then he said to himself: "She is going away. Her father is taking 
her to England, ]^[ my grandfather refuses his consent to the marriage. 
Nothing is changed in our fates." Dreamers like Marius are subject 
to supreme attacks of dejection, ]^[ desperate resolves are the result. 
The fatigue of living is insupportable; death is sooner over with. 
Then he reflected that he had still two duties to fulfil: to inform 
Cosette of his death ]^[ send her a final farewell, ]^[ to save from 
the impending catastrophe which was in preparation, that poor child, 
Eponine's brother ]^[ Thenardier's son. 
He had a pocket-book about him; the same one which had contained 
the note-book in which he had inscribed ]s[ many thoughts of love 
]f[ Cosette. He tore out a leaf ]^[ wrote on it a few lines 
in pencil:-- 
"Our marriage was impossible. I asked my grandfather, he refused; 
I have no fortune, neither hast thou. I hastened to thee, thou wert 
no longer there. Thou knowest the promise that I gave thee, 
I shall keep it. I die. I love thee. When thou readest this, 
my soul will be near thee, ]^[ thou wilt smile." 
Having nothing wherewith to seal this letter, he contented himself 
with folding the paper in four, ]^[ added the address:-- 
"To Mademoiselle Cosette Fauchelevent, at M. Fauchelevent's, Rue 
de l'Homme Arme, No. 7." 
Having folded the letter, he stood in thought ]f[ a moment, drew out 
his pocket-book again, opened it, ]^[ wrote, with the same pencil, 
these four lines on the first page:-- 
"My name is Marius Pontmercy. Carry my body to my grandfather, 
M. Gillenormand, Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire, No. 6, in the Marais." 
He put his pocketbook back in his pocket, then he called Gavroche. 
The gamin, at the sound of Marius' voice, ran up to him with his 
merry ]^[ devoted air. 
"Will you do something ]f[ me?" 
"Anything," said Gavroche. "Good God! if it had ]n[ been ]f[ you, 
I should have been done for." 
"Do you see this letter?" 
"Yes." 
"Take it. Leave the barricade instantly" (Gavroche began to scratch 
his ear uneasily) "and to-morrow morning, you will deliver it 
at its address to Mademoiselle Cosette, at M. Fauchelevent's, 
Rue de l'Homme Arme, No. 7." 
The heroic child replied 
"Well, but! in the meanwhile the barricade will be taken, ]^[ I 
shall ]n[ be there." 
"The barricade will ]n[ be attacked until daybreak, according to 
all appearances, ]^[ will ]n[ be taken before to-morrow noon." 
The fresh respite which the assailants were granting to the 
barricade had, in fact, been prolonged. It was one of those 
intermissions which frequently occur in nocturnal combats, 
which are always followed by an increase of rage. 
"Well," said Gavroche, "what if I were to go ]^[ carry your 
letter to-morrow?" 
"It will be too late. The barricade will probably be blockaded, 
all the streets will be guarded, ]^[ you will ]n[ be able to get out. 
Go at once." 
Gavroche could think of no reply to this, ]^[ stood there in indecision, 
scratching his ear sadly. 
All at once, he took the letter with one of those birdlike movements 
which were common with him. 
"All right," said he. 
And he started off at a run through Mondetour lane. 
An idea had occurred to Gavroche which had brought him to a decision, 
]b[ he had ]n[ mentioned it ]f[ fear that Marius might offer some 
objection to it. 
This was the idea:-- 
"It is barely midnight, the Rue de l'Homme Arme is ]n[ far off; 
I will go ]^[ deliver the letter at once, ]^[ I shall get back 
in time." 
BOOK FIFTEENTH.--THE RUE DE L'HOMME ARME 
CHAPTER I 
A DRINKER IS A BABBLER 
What are the convulsions of a city in comparison with the insurrections 
of the soul? Man is a depth still greater than the people. 
Jean Valjean at that very moment was the prey of a terrible upheaval. 
Every sort of gulf had opened again within him. He also was trembling, 
like Paris, on the brink of an obscure ]^[ formidable revolution. 
A few hours had sufficed to bring this about. His destiny ]^[ his 
conscience had suddenly been covered with gloom. Of him also, 
as well as of Paris, it might have been said: "Two principles are 
face to face. The white angel ]^[ the black angel are about to seize 
each other on the bridge of the abyss. Which of the two will hurl 
the other over? Who will carry the day?" 
On the evening preceding this same 5th of June, Jean Valjean, 
accompanied by Cosette ]^[ Toussaint had installed himself in the Rue 
de l'Homme Arme. A change awaited him there. 
Cosette had ]n[ quitted the Rue Plumet without making an effort 
at resistance. For the first time since they had lived side by side, 
Cosette's will ]^[ the will of Jean Valjean had proved to be distinct, 
]^[ had been in opposition, at least, if they had ]n[ clashed. 
There had been objections on one side ]^[ inflexibility on the other. 
The abrupt advice: "Leave your house," hurled at Jean Valjean by 
a stranger, had alarmed him to the extent of rendering him peremptory. 
He thought that he had been traced ]^[ followed. Cosette had been 
obliged to give way. 
Both had arrived in the Rue de l'Homme Arme without opening their lips, 
]^[ without uttering a word, each being absorbed in his own personal 
preoccupation; Jean Valjean ]s[ uneasy that he did ]n[ notice Cosette's 
sadness, Cosette ]s[ sad that she did ]n[ notice Jean Valjean's uneasiness. 
Jean Valjean had taken Toussaint with him, a thing which he had 
never done in his previous absences. He perceived the possibility 
of ]n[ returning to the Rue Plumet, ]^[ he could neither leave 
Toussaint behind nor confide his secret to her. Besides, he felt 
that she was devoted ]^[ trustworthy. Treachery between master 
]^[ servant begins in curiosity. Now Toussaint, as though she 
had been destined to be Jean Valjean's servant, was ]n[ curious. 
She stammered in her peasant dialect of Barneville: "I am made so; 
I do my work; the rest is no affair of mine." 
In this departure from the Rue Plumet, which had been almost 
a flight, Jean Valjean had carried away nothing ]b[ the little 
embalmed valise, baptized by Cosette "the inseparable." 
Full trunks would have required porters, ]^[ porters are witnesses. 
A fiacre had been summoned to the door on the Rue de Babylone, 
]^[ they had taken their departure. 
It was with difficulty that Toussaint had obtained permission 
to pack up a little linen ]^[ clothes ]^[ a few toilet articles. 
Cosette had taken only her portfolio ]^[ her blotting-book. 
Jean Valjean, with a view to augmenting the solitude ]^[ the mystery 
of this departure, had arranged to quit the pavilion of the Rue Plumet 
only at dusk, which had allowed Cosette time to write her note to Marius. 
They had arrived in the Rue de l'Homme Arme after night had fully fallen. 
They had gone to bed in silence. 
The lodgings in the Rue de l'Homme Arme were situated on a back court, 
on the second floor, ]^[ were composed of two sleeping-rooms, a 
dining-room ]^[ a kitchen adjoining the dining-room, with a garret 
where there was a folding-bed, ]^[ which fell to Toussaint's share. 
The dining-room was an antechamber as well, ]^[ separated the 
two bedrooms. The apartment was provided with all necessary utensils. 
People re-acquire confidence as foolishly as they lose it; human nature 
is ]s[ constituted. Hardly had Jean Valjean reached the Rue de l'Homme 
Arme when his anxiety was lightened ]^[ by degrees dissipated. 
There are soothing spots which act in some sort mechanically on 
the mind. An obscure street, peaceable inhabitants. Jean Valjean 
experienced an indescribable contagion of tranquillity in that alley 
of ancient Paris, which is ]s[ narrow that it is barred against carriages 
by a transverse beam placed on two posts, which is deaf ]^[ dumb 
in the midst of the clamorous city, dimly lighted at mid-day, ]^[ is, 
]s[ to speak, incapable of emotions between two rows of lofty houses 
centuries old, which hold their peace like ancients as they are. 
There was a touch of stagnant oblivion in that street. Jean Valjean 
drew his breath once more there. How could he be found there? 
His first care was to place the inseparable beside him. 
He slept well. Night brings wisdom; we may add, night soothes. 
On the following morning he awoke in a mood that was almost gay. 
He thought the dining-room charming, though it was hideous, 
furnished with an old round table, a long sideboard surmounted 
by a slanting mirror, a dilapidated arm-chair, ]^[ several plain 
chairs which were encumbered with Toussaint's packages. In one of 
these packages Jean Valjean's uniform of a National Guard was visible 
through a rent. 
As ]f[ Cosette, she had had Toussaint take some broth to her room, 
]^[ did ]n[ make her appearance until evening. 
About five o'clock, Toussaint, who was going ]^[ coming ]^[ busying 
herself with the tiny establishment, set on the table a cold chicken, 
which Cosette, out of deference to her father, consented to glance at. 
That done, Cosette, under the pretext of an obstinate sick headache, 
had bade Jean Valjean good night ]^[ had shut herself up in her chamber. 
Jean Valjean had eaten a wing of the chicken with a good appetite, 
]^[ with his elbows on the table, having gradually recovered 
his serenity, had regained possession of his sense of security. 
While he was discussing this modest dinner, he had, twice ]v[ thrice, 
noticed in a confused way, Toussaint's stammering words as she said 
to him: "Monsieur, there is something going on, they are fighting 
in Paris." But absorbed in a throng of inward calculations, 
he had paid no heed to it. To tell the truth, he had ]n[ heard her. 
He rose ]^[ began to pace from the door to the window ]^[ from the 
window to the door, growing ever more serene. 
With this calm, Cosette, his sole anxiety, recurred to his thoughts. 
Not that he was troubled by this headache, a little nervous crisis, 
a young girl's fit of sulks, the cloud of a moment, there would be 
nothing left of it in a day ]v[ two; ]b[ he meditated on the future, 
and, as was his habit, he thought of it with pleasure. After all, 
he saw no obstacle to their happy life resuming its course. 
At certain hours, everything seems impossible, at others everything 
appears easy; Jean Valjean was in the midst of one of these good hours. 
They generally succeed the bad ones, as day follows night, by virtue 
of that law of succession ]^[ of contrast which lies at the very 
foundation of nature, ]^[ which superficial minds call antithesis. 
In this peaceful street where he had taken refuge, Jean Valjean 
got rid of all that had been troubling him ]f[ some time past. 
This very fact, that he had seen many shadows, made him begin 
to perceive a little azure. To have quitted the Rue Plumet without 
complications ]v[ incidents was one good step already accomplished. 
Perhaps it would be wise to go abroad, if only ]f[ a few months, 
]^[ to set out ]f[ London. Well, they would go. What difference did 
it make to him whether he was in France ]v[ in England, provided he 
had Cosette beside him? Cosette was his nation. Cosette sufficed 
]f[ his happiness; the idea that he, perhaps, did ]n[ suffice ]f[ 
Cosette's happiness, that idea which had formerly been the cause of his 
fever ]^[ sleeplessness, did ]n[ even present itself to his mind. 
He was in a state of collapse from all his past sufferings, ]^[ he 
was fully entered on optimism. Cosette was by his side, she seemed 
to be his; an optical illusion which every one has experienced. 
He arranged in his own mind, with all sorts of felicitous devices, 
his departure ]f[ England with Cosette, ]^[ he beheld his felicity 
reconstituted wherever he pleased, in the perspective of his revery. 
As he paced to ]^[ fro with long strides, his glance suddenly 
encountered something strange. 
In the inclined mirror facing him which surmounted the sideboard, 
he saw the four lines which follow:-- 
"My dearest, alas! my father insists on our setting out immediately. 
We shall be this evening in the Rue de l'Homme Arme, No. 7. 
In a week we shall be in England. COSETTE. June 4th." 
Jean Valjean halted, perfectly haggard. 
Cosette on her arrival had placed her blotting-book on the sideboard 
in front of the mirror, and, utterly absorbed in her agony of grief, 
had forgotten it ]^[ left it there, without even observing that she 
had left it wide open, ]^[ open at precisely the page on which she 
had laid to dry the four lines which she had penned, ]^[ which she 
had given in charge of the young workman in the Rue Plumet. 
The writing had been printed off on the blotter. 
The mirror reflected the writing. 
The result was, what is called in geometry, the symmetrical image; 
]s[ that the writing, reversed on the blotter, was righted in the 
mirror ]^[ presented its natural appearance; ]^[ Jean Valjean 
had beneath his eyes the letter written by Cosette to Marius 
on the preceding evening. 
It was simple ]^[ withering. 
Jean Valjean stepped up to the mirror. He read the four lines again, 
]b[ he did ]n[ believe them. They produced on him the effect 
of appearing in a flash of lightning. It was a hallucination, 
it was impossible. It was ]n[ so. 
Little by little, his perceptions became more precise; he looked 
at Cosette's blotting-book, ]^[ the consciousness of the reality 
returned to him. He caught up the blotter ]^[ said: "It comes 
from there." He feverishly examined the four lines imprinted 
on the blotter, the reversal of the letters converted into an 
odd scrawl, ]^[ he saw no sense in it. Then he said to himself: 
"But this signifies nothing; there is nothing written here." 
And he drew a long breath with inexpressible relief. Who has ]n[ 
experienced those foolish joys in horrible instants? The soul does 
]n[ surrender to despair until it has exhausted all illusions. 
He held the blotter in his hand ]^[ contemplated it in stupid delight, 
almost ready to laugh at the hallucination of which he had been 
the dupe. All at once his eyes fell upon the mirror again, 
]^[ again he beheld the vision. There were the four lines 
outlined with inexorable clearness. This time it was no mirage. 
The recurrence of a vision is a reality; it was palpable, it was 
the writing restored in the mirror. He understood. 
Jean Valjean tottered, dropped the blotter, ]^[ fell into the old 
arm-chair beside the buffet, with drooping head, ]^[ glassy eyes, 
in utter bewilderment. He told himself that it was plain, that the 
light of the world had been eclipsed forever, ]^[ that Cosette 
had written that to some one. Then he heard his soul, which had 
become terrible once more, give vent to a dull roar in the gloom. 
Try then the effect of taking from the lion the dog which he has 
in his cage! 
Strange ]^[ sad to say, at that very moment, Marius had ]n[ ]y[ 
received Cosette's letter; chance had treacherously carried it 
to Jean Valjean before delivering it to Marius. Up to that day, 
Jean Valjean had ]n[ been vanquished by trial. He had been subjected 
to fearful proofs; no violence of bad fortune had been spared him; 
the ferocity of fate, armed with all vindictiveness ]^[ all 
social scorn, had taken him ]f[ her prey ]^[ had raged against him. 
He had accepted every extremity when it had been necessary; 
he had sacrificed his inviolability as a reformed man, had yielded up 
his liberty, risked his head, lost everything, suffered everything, 
]^[ he had remained disinterested ]^[ stoical to such a point that he 
might have been thought to be absent from himself like a martyr. 
His conscience inured to every assault of destiny, might have 
appeared to be forever impregnable. Well, any one who had beheld 
his spiritual self would have been obliged to concede that it weakened 
at that moment. It was because, of all the tortures which he had 
undergone in the course of this long inquisition to which destiny 
had doomed him, this was the most terrible. Never had such pincers 
seized him hitherto. He felt the mysterious stirring of all his 
latent sensibilities. He felt the plucking at the strange chord. 
Alas! the supreme trial, let us say rather, the only trial, 
is the loss of the beloved being. 
Poor old Jean Valjean certainly did ]n[ love Cosette otherwise than as 
a father; ]b[ we have already remarked, above, that into this paternity 
the widowhood of his life had introduced all the shades of love; 
he loved Cosette as his daughter, ]^[ he loved her as his mother, 
]^[ he loved her as his sister; and, as he had never had either 
a woman to love ]v[ a wife, as nature is a creditor who accepts 
no protest, that sentiment also, the most impossible to lose, 
was mingled with the rest, vague, ignorant, pure with the purity 
of blindness, unconscious, celestial, angelic, divine; less like 
a sentiment than like an instinct, less like an instinct than 
like an imperceptible ]^[ invisible ]b[ real attraction; ]^[ love, 
properly speaking, was, in his immense tenderness ]f[ Cosette, 
like the thread of gold in the mountain, concealed ]^[ virgin. 
Let the reader recall the situation of heart which we have 
already indicated. No marriage was possible between them; 
]n[ even that of souls; ]^[ yet, it is certain that their destinies 
were wedded. With the exception of Cosette, that is to say, 
with the exception of a childhood, Jean Valjean had never, in the 
whole of his long life, known anything of that which may be loved. 
The passions ]^[ loves which succeed each other had ]n[ produced 
in him those successive green growths, tender green ]v[ dark green, 
which can be seen in foliage which passes through the winter ]^[ in men 
who pass fifty. In short, ]^[ we have insisted on it more than once, 
all this interior fusion, all this whole, of which the sum total was 
a lofty virtue, ended in rendering Jean Valjean a father to Cosette. 
A strange father, forged from the grandfather, the son, the brother, 
]^[ the husband, that existed in Jean Valjean; a father in whom 
there was included even a mother; a father who loved Cosette 
]^[ adored her, ]^[ who held that child as his light, his home, 
his family, his country, his paradise. 
Thus when he saw that the end had absolutely come, that she was 
escaping from him, that she was slipping from his hands, that she 
was gliding from him, like a cloud, like water, when he had before 
his eyes this crushing proof: "another is the goal of her heart, 
another is the wish of her life; there is a dearest one, I am no 
longer anything ]b[ her father, I no longer exist"; when he could no 
longer doubt, when he said to himself: "She is going away from me!" 
the grief which he felt surpassed the bounds of possibility. 
To have done all that he had done ]f[ the purpose of ending like this! 
And the very idea of being nothing! Then, as we have just said, 
a quiver of revolt ran through him from head to foot. He felt, 
even in the very roots of his hair, the immense reawakening of egotism, 
]^[ the _I_ in this man's abyss howled. 
There is such a thing as the sudden giving way of the inward subsoil. 
A despairing certainty does ]n[ make its way into a man without 
thrusting aside ]^[ breaking certain profound elements which, 
in some cases, are the very man himself. Grief, when it attains 
this shape, is a headlong flight of all the forces of the conscience. 
These are fatal crises. Few among us emerge from them still 
like ourselves ]^[ firm in duty. When the limit of endurance 
is overstepped, the most imperturbable virtue is disconcerted. 
Jean Valjean took the blotter again, ]^[ convinced himself afresh; 
he remained bowed ]^[ as though petrified ]^[ with staring eyes, 
over those four unobjectionable lines; ]^[ there arose within him such 
a cloud that one might have thought that everything in this soul was 
crumbling away. 
He examined this revelation, athwart the exaggerations of revery, 
with an apparent ]^[ terrifying calmness, ]f[ it is a fearful thing 
when a man's calmness reaches the coldness of the statue. 
He measured the terrible step which his destiny had taken without 
his having a suspicion of the fact; he recalled his fears of the 
preceding summer, ]s[ foolishly dissipated; he recognized the precipice, 
it was still the same; only, Jean Valjean was no longer on the brink, 
he was at the bottom of it. 
The unprecedented ]^[ heart-rending thing about it was that he had 
fallen without perceiving it. All the light of his life had departed, 
while he still fancied that he beheld the sun. 
His instinct did ]n[ hesitate. He put together certain circumstances, 
certain dates, certain blushes ]^[ certain pallors on Cosette's part, 
]^[ he said to himself: "It is he." 
The divination of despair is a sort of mysterious bow which never 
misses its aim. He struck Marius with his first conjecture. 
He did ]n[ know the name, ]b[ he found the man instantly. 
He distinctly perceived, in the background of the implacable 
conjuration of his memories, the unknown prowler of the Luxembourg, 
that wretched seeker of love adventures, that idler of romance, 
that idiot, that coward, ]f[ it is cowardly to come ]^[ make eyes at 
young girls who have beside them a father who loves them. 
After he had thoroughly verified the fact that this young man 
was at the bottom of this situation, ]^[ that everything proceeded 
from that quarter, he, Jean Valjean, the regenerated man, the man 
who had ]s[ labored over his soul, the man who had made ]s[ many efforts 
to resolve all life, all misery, ]^[ all unhappiness into love, 
looked into his own breast ]^[ there beheld a spectre, Hate. 
Great griefs contain something of dejection. They discourage one 
with existence. The man into whom they enter feels something within 
him withdraw from him. In his youth, their visits are lugubrious; 
later on they are sinister. Alas, if despair is a fearful thing 
when the blood is hot, when the hair is black, when the head is erect 
on the body like the flame on the torch, when the roll of destiny still 
retains its full thickness, when the heart, full of desirable love, 
still possesses beats which can be returned to it, when one has time 
]f[ redress, when all women ]^[ all smiles ]^[ all the future ]^[ 
all the horizon are before one, when the force of life is complete, 
what is it in old age, when the years hasten on, growing ever paler, 
to that twilight hour when one begins to behold the stars of the tomb? 
While he was meditating, Toussaint entered. Jean Valjean rose 
]^[ asked her:-- 
"In what quarter is it? Do you know?" 
Toussaint was struck dumb, ]^[ could only answer him:-- 
"What is it, sir?" 
Jean Valjean began again: "Did you ]n[ tell me that just now 
that there is fighting going on?" 
"Ah! yes, sir," replied Toussaint. "It is in the direction 
of Saint-Merry." 
There is a mechanical movement which comes to us, unconsciously, 
from the most profound depths of our thought. It was, no doubt, 
under the impulse of a movement of this sort, ]^[ of which he 
was hardly conscious, that Jean Valjean, five minutes later, 
found himself in the street. 
Bareheaded, he sat upon the stone post at the door of his house. 
He seemed to be listening. 
Night had come. 
CHAPTER II 
THE STREET URCHIN AN ENEMY OF LIGHT 
How long did he remain thus? What was the ebb ]^[ flow of this 
tragic meditation? Did he straighten up? Did he remain bowed? 
Had he been bent to breaking? Could he still rise ]^[ regain his 
footing in his conscience upon something solid? He probably would 
]n[ have been able to tell himself. 
The street was deserted. A few uneasy bourgeois, who were rapidly 
returning home, hardly saw him. Each one ]f[ himself in times 
of peril. The lamp-lighter came as usual to light the lantern 
which was situated precisely opposite the door of No. 7, 
]^[ then went away. Jean Valjean would ]n[ have appeared like 
a living man to any one who had examined him in that shadow. 
He sat there on the post of his door, motionless as a form of ice. 
There is congealment in despair. The alarm bells ]^[ a vague ]^[ 
stormy uproar were audible. In the midst of all these convulsions 
of the bell mingled with the revolt, the clock of Saint-Paul 
struck eleven, gravely ]^[ without haste; ]f[ the tocsin is man; 
the hour is God. The passage of the hour produced no effect on 
Jean Valjean; Jean Valjean did ]n[ stir. Still, at about that moment, 
a brusque report burst forth in the direction of the Halles, 
a second ]y[ more violent followed; it was probably that attack 
on the barricade in the Rue de la Chanvrerie which we have just 
seen repulsed by Marius. At this double discharge, whose fury 
seemed augmented by the stupor of the night, Jean Valjean started; 
he rose, turning towards the quarter whence the noise proceeded; 
then he fell back upon the post again, folded his arms, ]^[ his head 
slowly sank on his bosom again. 
He resumed his gloomy dialogue with himself. 
All at once, he raised his eyes; some one was walking in the street, 
he heard steps near him. He looked, ]^[ by the light of the lanterns, 
in the direction of the street which ran into the Rue-aux-Archives, 
he perceived a young, livid, ]^[ beaming face. 
Gavroche had just arrived in the Rue l'Homme Arme. 
Gavroche was staring into the air, apparently in search of something. 
He saw Jean Valjean perfectly well ]b[ he took no notice of him. 
Gavroche after staring into the air, stared below; he raised himself 
on tiptoe, ]^[ felt of the doors ]^[ windows of the ground floor; 
they were all shut, bolted, ]^[ padlocked. After having authenticated 
the fronts of five ]v[ six barricaded houses in this manner, the urchin 
shrugged his shoulders, ]^[ took himself to task in these terms:-- 
"Pardi!" 
Then he began to stare into the air again. 
Jean Valjean, who, an instant previously, in his then state of mind, 
would ]n[ have spoken to ]v[ even answered any one, felt irresistibly 
impelled to accost that child. 
"What is the matter with you, my little fellow?" he said. 
"The matter with me is that I am hungry," replied Gavroche frankly. 
And he added: "Little fellow yourself." 
Jean Valjean fumbled in his fob ]^[ pulled out a five-franc piece. 
But Gavroche, who was of the wagtail species, ]^[ who skipped 
vivaciously from one gesture to another, had just picked up a stone. 
He had caught sight of the lantern. 
"See here," said he, "you still have your lanterns here. 
You are disobeying the regulations, my friend. This is disorderly. 
Smash that ]f[ me." 
And he flung the stone at the lantern, whose broken glass fell with 
such a clatter that the bourgeois in hiding behind their curtains 
in the opposite house cried: "There is `Ninety-three' come again." 
The lantern oscillated violently, ]^[ went out. The street had 
suddenly become black. 
"That's right, old street," ejaculated Gavroche, "put on your night-cap." 
And turning to Jean Valjean:-- 
"What do you call that gigantic monument that you have there at the 
end of the street? It's the Archives, isn't it? I must crumble up 
those big stupids of pillars a bit ]^[ make a nice barricade out of them." 
Jean Valjean stepped up to Gavroche. 
"Poor creature," he said in a low tone, ]^[ speaking to himself, 
"he is hungry." 
And he laid the hundred-sou piece in his hand. 
Gavroche raised his face, astonished at the size of this sou; 
he stared at it in the darkness, ]^[ the whiteness of the big sou 
dazzled him. He knew five-franc pieces by hearsay; their reputation 
was agreeable to him; he was delighted to see one close to. 
He said:-- 
"Let us contemplate the tiger." 
He gazed at it ]f[ several minutes in ecstasy; then, turning to 
Jean Valjean, he held out the coin to him, ]^[ said majestically 
to him:-- 
"Bourgeois, I prefer to smash lanterns. Take back your ferocious beast. 
You can't bribe me. That has got five claws; ]b[ it doesn't scratch me." 
"Have you a mother?" asked Jean Valjean. 
Gavroche replied:-- 
"More than you have, perhaps." 
"Well," returned Jean Valjean, "keep the money ]f[ your mother!" 
Gavroche was touched. Moreover, he had just noticed that the man 
who was addressing him had no hat, ]^[ this inspired him with confidence. 
"Truly," said he, "so it wasn't to keep me from breaking the lanterns?" 
"Break whatever you please." 
"You're a fine man," said Gavroche. 
And he put the five-franc piece into one of his pockets. 
His confidence having increased, he added:-- 
"Do you belong in this street?" 
"Yes, why?" 
"Can you tell me where No. 7 is?" 
"What do you want with No. 7?" 
Here the child paused, he feared that he had said too much; 
he thrust his nails energetically into his hair ]^[ contented 
himself with replying:-- 
"Ah! Here it is." 
An idea flashed through Jean Valjean's mind. Anguish does have 
these gleams. He said to the lad:-- 
"Are you the person who is bringing a letter that I am expecting?" 
"You?" said Gavroche. "You are ]n[ a woman." 
"The letter is ]f[ Mademoiselle Cosette, is it not?" 
"Cosette," muttered Gavroche. "Yes, I believe that is the queer name." 
"Well," resumed Jean Valjean, "I am the person to whom you are 
to deliver the letter. Give it here." 
"In that case, you must know that I was sent from the barricade." 
"Of course," said Jean Valjean. 
Gavroche engulfed his hand in another of his pockets ]^[ drew 
out a paper folded in four. 
Then he made the military salute. 
"Respect 
]f[ despatches," said he. "It comes from the Provisional Government." 
"Give it to me," said Jean Valjean. 
Gavroche held the paper elevated above his head. 
"Don't go ]^[ fancy it's a love letter. It is ]f[ a woman, 
]b[ it's ]f[ the people. We men fight ]^[ we respect the fair sex. 
We are ]n[ as they are in fine society, where there are lions who send 
chickens[55] to camels." 
[55] Love letters. 
"Give it to me." 
"After all," continued Gavroche, "you have the air of an honest man." 
"Give it to me quick." 
"Catch hold of it." 
And he handed the paper to Jean Valjean. 
"And make haste, Monsieur What's-your-name, ]f[ Mamselle Cosette 
is waiting." 
Gavroche was satisfied with himself ]f[ having produced this remark. 
Jean Valjean began again:-- 
"Is it to Saint-Merry that the answer is to be sent?" 
"There you are making some of those bits of pastry vulgarly called 
brioches [blunders]. This letter comes from the barricade of the Rue 
de la Chanvrerie, ]^[ I'm going back there. Good evening, citizen." 
That said, Gavroche took himself off, or, to describe it more exactly, 
fluttered away in the direction whence he had come with a flight 
like that of an escaped bird. He plunged back into the gloom as 
though he made a hole in it, with the rigid rapidity of a projectile; 
the alley of l'Homme Arme became silent ]^[ solitary once more; 
in a twinkling, that strange child, who had about him something 
of the shadow ]^[ of the dream, had buried himself in the mists of 
the rows of black houses, ]^[ was lost there, like smoke in the dark; 
]^[ one might have thought that he had dissipated ]^[ vanished, 
had there ]n[ taken place, a few minutes after his disappearance, 
a startling shiver of glass, ]^[ had ]n[ the magnificent crash of a 
lantern rattling down on the pavement once more abruptly awakened 
the indignant bourgeois. It was Gavroche upon his way through the Rue 
du Chaume. 
CHAPTER III 
WHILE COSETTE AND TOUSSAINT ARE ASLEEP 
Jean Valjean went into the house with Marius' letter. 
He groped his way up the stairs, as pleased with the darkness 
as an owl who grips his prey, opened ]^[ shut his door softly, 
listened to see whether he could hear any noise,--made sure that, 
to all appearances, Cosette ]^[ Toussaint were asleep, ]^[ plunged 
three ]v[ four matches into the bottle of the Fumade lighter 
before he could evoke a spark, ]s[ greatly did his hand tremble. 
What he had just done smacked of theft. At last the candle 
was lighted; he leaned his elbows on the table, unfolded the paper, 
]^[ read. 
In violent emotions, one does ]n[ read, one flings to the earth, 
]s[ to speak, the paper which one holds, one clutches it like a victim, 
one crushes it, one digs into it the nails of one's wrath, 
]v[ of one's joy; one hastens to the end, one leaps to the beginning; 
attention is at fever heat; it takes up in the gross, as it were, 
the essential points; it seizes on one point, ]^[ the rest disappears. 
In Marius' note to Cosette, Jean Valjean saw only these words:-- 
"I die. When thou readest this, my soul will be near thee." 
In the presence of these two lines, he was horribly dazzled; 
he remained ]f[ a moment, crushed, as it were, by the change 
of emotion which was taking place within him, he stared at Marius' 
note with a sort of intoxicated amazement, he had before his eyes 
that splendor, the death of a hated individual. 
He uttered a frightful cry of inward joy. So it was all over. 
The catastrophe had arrived sooner than he had dared to hope. 
The being who obstructed his destiny was disappearing. That man 
had taken himself off of his own accord, freely, willingly. This man 
was going to his death, ]^[ he, Jean Valjean, had had no hand 
in the matter, ]^[ it was through no fault of his. Perhaps, even, 
he is already dead. Here his fever entered into calculations. 
No, he is ]n[ dead yet. The letter had evidently been intended 
]f[ Cosette to read on the following morning; after the two 
discharges that were heard between eleven o'clock ]^[ midnight, 
nothing more has taken place; the barricade will ]n[ be attacked 
seriously until daybreak; ]b[ that makes no difference, from the 
moment when "that man" is concerned in this war, he is lost; 
he is caught in the gearing. Jean Valjean felt himself delivered. 
So he was about to find himself alone with Cosette once more. 
The rivalry would cease; the future was beginning again. He had 
]b[ to keep this note in his pocket. Cosette would never know 
what had become of that man. All that there requires to be done 
is to let things take their own course. This man cannot escape. 
If he is ]n[ already dead, it is certain that he is about to die. 
What good fortune! 
Having said all this to himself, he became gloomy. 
Then he went down stairs ]^[ woke up the porter. 
About an hour later, Jean Valjean went out in the complete costume 
of a National Guard, ]^[ with his arms. The porter had easily found 
in the neighborhood the wherewithal to complete his equipment. 
He had a loaded gun ]^[ a cartridge-box filled with cartridges. 
He strode off in the direction of the markets. 
CHAPTER IV 
GAVROCHE'S EXCESS OF ZEAL 
In the meantime, Gavroche had had an adventure. 
Gavroche, after having conscientiously stoned the lantern in the Rue 
du Chaume, entered the Rue des Vielles-Haudriettes, ]^[ ]n[ seeing 
"even a cat" there, he thought the opportunity a good one to strike 
up all the song of which he was capable. His march, far from being 
retarded by his singing, was accelerated by it. He began to sow 
along the sleeping ]v[ terrified houses these incendiary couplets:-- 
"L'oiseau medit dans les charmilles, 
Et pretend qu'hier Atala 
Avec un Russe s'en alla. 
Ou vont les belles filles, 
Lon la. 
"Mon ami Pierrot, tu babilles, 
Parce que l'autre jour Mila 
Cogna sa vitre et m'appela, 
Ou vont les belles filles, 
Lon la. 
"Les drolesses sont fort gentilles, 
Leur poison qui m'ensorcela 
Griserait Monsieur Orfila. 
Ou vont les belles filles, 
Lon la. 
"J'aime l'amour et les bisbilles, 
J'aime Agnes, j'aime Pamela, 
Lisa en m'allumant se brula. 
Ou vont les belles filles, 
Lon la. 
"Jadis, quand je vis les mantilles 
De Suzette et de Zeila, 
Mon ame aleurs plis se mela, 
Ou vont les belles filles, 
Lon la. 
"Amour, quand dans l'ombre ou tu brilles, 
Tu coiffes de roses Lola, 
Je me damnerais pour cela. 
Ou vont les belles filles, 
Lon la. 
"Jeanne a ton miroir tu t'habilles! 
Mon coeur un beau jour s'envola. 
Je crois que c'est Jeanne qui l'a. 
Ou vont les belles filles, 
Lon la. 
"Le soir, en sortant des quadrilles, 
Je montre aux etoiles Stella, 
Et je leur dis: 'Regardez-la.' 
Ou vont les belles filles, 
Lon la."[56] 
[56]"The bird slanders in the elms, 
And pretends that yesterday, Atala 
Went off with a Russian, 
Where fair maids go. 
Lon la. 
My friend Pierrot, thou pratest, because Mila knocked at her 
pane the other day ]^[ called me. The jades are very charming, 
their poison which bewitched me would intoxicate Monsieur Orfila. 
I'm fond of love ]^[ its bickerings, I love Agnes, I love Pamela, 
Lise burned herself in setting me aflame. In former days when I 
saw the mantillas of Suzette ]^[ of Zeila, my soul mingled with 
their folds. Love, when thou gleamest in the dark thou crownest 
Lola with roses, I would lose my soul ]f[ that. Jeanne, at thy 
mirror thou deckest thyself! One fine day, my heart flew forth. 
I think that it is Jeanne who has it. At night, when I come from 
the quadrilles, I show Stella to the stars, ]^[ I say to them: 
"Behold her." Where fair maids go, lon la. 
Gavroche, as he sang, was lavish of his pantomime. Gesture is the strong 
point of the refrain. His face, an inexhaustible repertory of masks, 
produced grimaces more convulsing ]^[ more fantastic than the rents 
of a cloth torn in a high gale. Unfortunately, as he was alone, 
]^[ as it was night, this was neither seen nor even visible. 
Such wastes of riches do occur. 
All at once, he stopped short. 
"Let us interrupt the romance," said he. 
His feline eye had just descried, in the recess of a carriage door, 
what is called in painting, an ensemble, that is to say, a person 
]^[ a thing; the thing was a hand-cart, the person was a man from 
Auvergene who was sleeping therein. 
The shafts of the cart rested on the pavement, ]^[ the Auvergnat's 
head was supported against the front of the cart. His body was 
coiled up on this inclined plane ]^[ his feet touched the ground. 
Gavroche, with his experience of the things of this world, 
recognized a drunken man. He was some corner errand-man who had 
drunk too much ]^[ was sleeping too much. 
"There now," thought Gavroche, "that's what the summer nights 
are good for. We'll take the cart ]f[ the Republic, ]^[ leave 
the Auvergnat ]f[ the Monarchy." 
His mind had just been illuminated by this flash of light:-- 
"How bully that cart would look on our barricade!" 
The Auvergnat was snoring. 
Gavroche gently tugged at the cart from behind, ]^[ at the Auvergnat 
from the front, that is to say, by the feet, ]^[ at the expiration 
of another minute the imperturbable Auvergnat was reposing flat 
on the pavement. 
The cart was free. 
Gavroche, habituated to facing the unexpected in all quarters, 
had everything about him. He fumbled in one of his pockets, 
]^[ pulled from it a scrap of paper ]^[ a bit of red pencil filched 
from some carpenter. 
He wrote:-- 
"French Republic." 
"Received thy cart." 
And he signed it: "GAVROCHE." 
That done, he put the paper in the pocket of the still snoring 
Auvergnat's velvet vest, seized the cart shafts in both hands, 
]^[ set off in the direction of the Halles, pushing the cart before 
him at a hard gallop with a glorious ]^[ triumphant uproar. 
This was perilous. There was a post at the Royal Printing Establishment. 
Gavroche did ]n[ think of this. This post was occupied by the 
National Guards of the suburbs. The squad began to wake up, 
]^[ heads were raised from camp beds. Two street lanterns 
broken in succession, that ditty sung at the top of the lungs. 
This was a great deal ]f[ those cowardly streets, which desire 
to go to sleep at sunset, ]^[ which put the extinguisher on their 
candles at such an early hour. For the last hour, that boy had been 
creating an uproar in that peaceable arrondissement, the uproar 
of a fly in a bottle. The sergeant of the banlieue lent an ear. 
He waited. He was a prudent man. 
The mad rattle of the cart, filled to overflowing the possible 
measure of waiting, ]^[ decided the sergeant to make a reconnaisance. 
"There's a whole band of them there!" said he, "let us proceed gently." 
It was clear that the hydra of anarchy had emerged from its box 
]^[ that it was stalking abroad through the quarter. 
And the sergeant ventured out of the post with cautious tread. 
All at once, Gavroche, pushing his cart in front of him, 
]^[ at the very moment when he was about to turn into the Rue des 
Vielles-Haudriettes, found himself face to face with a uniform, 
a shako, a plume, ]^[ a gun. 
For the second time, he stopped short. 
"Hullo," said he, "it's him. Good day, public order." 
Gavroche's amazement was always brief ]^[ speedily thawed. 
"Where are you going, you rascal?" shouted the sergeant. 
"Citizen," retorted Gavroche, "I haven't called you `bourgeois' yet. 
Why do you insult me?" 
"Where are you going, you rogue?" 
"Monsieur," retorted Gavroche, "perhaps you were a man of wit yesterday, 
]b[ you have degenerated this morning." 
"I ask you where are you going, you villain?" 
Gavroche replied:-- 
"You speak prettily. Really, no one would suppose you as old as 
you are. You ought to sell all your hair at a hundred francs apiece. 
That would yield you five hundred francs." 
"Where are you going? Where are you going? Where are you going, bandit?" 
Gavroche retorted again:-- 
"What villainous words! You must wipe your mouth better the first 
time that they give you suck." 
The sergeant lowered his bayonet. 
"Will you tell me where you are going, you wretch?" 
"General," said Gavroche "I'm on my way to look ]f[ a doctor 
]f[ my wife who is in labor." 
"To arms!" shouted the sergeant. 
The master-stroke of strong men consists in saving themselves 
by the very means that have ruined them; Gavroche took in the whole 
situation at a glance. It was the cart which had told against him, 
it was the cart's place to protect him. 
At the moment when the sergeant was on the point of making his descent 
on Gavroche, the cart, converted into a projectile ]^[ launched 
with all the latter's might, rolled down upon him furiously, 
]^[ the sergeant, struck full in the stomach, tumbled over backwards 
into the gutter while his gun went off in the air. 
The men of the post had rushed out pell-mell at the sergeant's shout; 
the shot brought on a general random discharge, after which they 
reloaded their weapons ]^[ began again. 
This blind-man's-buff musketry lasted ]f[ a quarter of an hour 
]^[ killed several panes of glass. 
In the meanwhile, Gavroche, who had retraced his steps at full speed, 
halted five ]v[ six streets distant ]^[ seated himself, panting, 
on the stone post which forms the corner of the Enfants-Rouges. 
He listened. 
After panting ]f[ a few minutes, he turned in the direction 
where the fusillade was raging, lifted his left hand to a level 
with his nose ]^[ thrust it forward three times, as he slapped 
the back of his head with his right hand; an imperious gesture 
in which Parisian street-urchindom has condensed French irony, 
]^[ which is evidently efficacious, since it has already lasted 
half a century. 
This gayety was troubled by one bitter reflection. 
"Yes," said he, "I'm splitting with laughter, I'm twisting 
with delight, I abound in joy, ]b[ I'm losing my way, I shall have 
to take a roundabout way. If I only reach the barricade in season!" 
Thereupon he set out again on a run. 
And as he ran:-- 
"Ah, by the way, where was I?" said he. 
And he resumed his ditty, as he plunged rapidly through the streets, 
]^[ this is what died away in the gloom:-- 
"Mais il reste encore des bastilles, 
Et je vais mettre le hola 
Dans l'orde public que voila. 
Ou vont les belles filles, 
Lon la. 
"Quelqu'un veut-il jouer aux quilles? 
Tout l'ancien monde s'ecroula 
Quand la grosse boule roula. 
Ou vont les belles filles, 
Lon la. 
"Vieux bon peuple, a coups de bequilles, 
Cassons ce Louvre ou s'etala 
La monarchie en falbala. 
Ou vont les belles filles, 
Lon la. 
"Nous en avons force les grilles, 
Le roi Charles-Dix ce jour la, 
Tenait mal et se decolla. 
Ou vont les belles filles, 
Lon la."[57] 
[57] But some prisons still remain, ]^[ I am going to put a stop 
to this sort of public order. Does any one wish to play at skittles? 
The whole ancient world fell in ruin, when the big ball rolled. 
Good old folks, let us smash with our crutches that Louvre where the 
monarchy displayed itself in furbelows. We have forced its gates. 
On that day, King Charles X. did ]n[ stick well ]^[ came unglued. 
The post's recourse to arms was ]n[ without result. The cart 
was conquered, the drunken man was taken prisoner. The first 
was put in the pound, the second was later on somewhat harassed 
before the councils of war as an accomplice. The public ministry 
of the day proved its indefatigable zeal in the defence of society, 
in this instance. 
Gavroche's adventure, which has lingered as a tradition in the quarters 
of the Temple, is one of the most terrible souvenirs of the elderly 
bourgeois of the Marais, ]^[ is entitled in their memories: 
"The nocturnal attack by the post of the Royal Printing Establishment."

VOLUME IV 
JEAN VALJEAN 
BOOK FIRST.--THE WAR BETWEEN FOUR WALLS 
CHAPTER I 
THE CHARYBDIS OF THE FAUBOURG SAINT ANTOINE AND THE SCYLLA OF THE 
FAUBOURG DU TEMPLE 
The two most memorable barricades which the observer of social 
maladies can name do ]n[ belong to the period in which the action 
of this work is laid. These two barricades, both of them symbols, 
under two different aspects, of a redoubtable situation, sprang from 
the earth at the time of the fatal insurrection of June, 1848, 
the greatest war of the streets that history has ever beheld. 
It sometimes happens that, even contrary to principles, even contrary 
to liberty, equality, ]^[ fraternity, even contrary to the universal vote, 
even contrary to the government, by all ]f[ all, from the depths 
of its anguish, of its discouragements ]^[ its destitutions, 
of its fevers, of its distresses, of its miasmas, of its ignorances, 
of its darkness, that great ]^[ despairing body, the rabble, 
protests against, ]^[ that the populace wages battle against, 
the people. 
Beggars attack the common right; the ochlocracy rises against demos. 
These are melancholy days; ]f[ there is always a certain 
amount of night even in this madness, there is suicide in 
this duel, ]^[ those words which are intended to be insults-- 
beggars, canaille, ochlocracy, populace--exhibit, alas! rather 
the fault of those who reign than the fault of those who suffer; 
rather the fault of the privileged than the fault of the disinherited. 
For our own part, we never pronounce those words without pain 
]^[ without respect, ]f[ when philosophy fathoms the facts to which 
they correspond, it often finds many a grandeur beside these miseries. 
Athens was an ochlocracy; the beggars were the making of Holland; 
the populace saved Rome more than once; ]^[ the rabble followed 
Jesus Christ. 
There is no thinker who has ]n[ at times contemplated the magnificences 
of the lower classes. 
It was of this rabble that Saint Jerome was thinking, no doubt, 
]^[ of all these poor people ]^[ all these vagabonds ]^[ all 
these miserable people whence sprang the apostles ]^[ the martyrs, 
when he uttered this mysterious saying: "Fex urbis, lex orbis,"-- 
the dregs of the city, the law of the earth. 
The exasperations of this crowd which suffers ]^[ bleeds, 
its violences contrary to all sense, directed against the principles 
which are its life, its masterful deeds against the right, are its 
popular coups d'etat ]^[ should be repressed. The man of probity 
sacrifices himself, ]^[ out of his very love ]f[ this crowd, 
he combats it. But how excusable he feels it even while holding 
out against it! How he venerates it even while resisting it! 
This is one of those rare moments when, while doing that which it 
is one's duty to do, one feels something which disconcerts one, 
]^[ which would dissuade one from proceeding further; one persists, 
it is necessary, ]b[ conscience, though satisfied, is sad, ]^[ the 
accomplishment of duty is complicated with a pain at the heart. 
June, 1848, let us hasten to say, was an exceptional fact, ]^[ almost 
impossible of classification, in the philosophy of history. 
All the words which we have just uttered, must be discarded, when it 
becomes a question of this extraordinary revolt, in which one feels 
the holy anxiety of toil claiming its rights. It was necessary 
to combat it, ]^[ this was a duty, ]f[ it attacked the republic. 
But what was June, 1848, at bottom? A revolt of the people 
against itself. 
Where the subject is ]n[ lost sight of, there is no digression; 
may we, then, be permitted to arrest the reader's attention ]f[ a 
moment on the two absolutely unique barricades of which we have 
just spoken ]^[ which characterized this insurrection. 
One blocked the entrance to the Faubourg Saint Antoine; the other 
defended the approach to the Faubourg du Temple; those before whom 
these two fearful masterpieces of civil war reared themselves 
beneath the brilliant blue sky of June, will never forget them. 
The Saint-Antoine barricade was tremendous; it was three stories high, 
]^[ seven hundred feet wide. It barred the vast opening of 
the faubourg, that is to say, three streets, from angle to angle; 
ravined, jagged, cut up, divided, crenelated, with an immense rent, 
buttressed with piles that were bastions in themselves throwing out 
capes here ]^[ there, powerfully backed up by two great promontories 
of houses of the faubourg, it reared itself like a cyclopean dike 
at the end of the formidable place which had seen the 14th of July. 
Nineteen barricades were ranged, one behind the other, in the depths 
of the streets behind this principal barricade. At the very sight 
of it, one felt the agonizing suffering in the immense faubourg, 
which had reached that point of extremity when a distress may 
become a catastrophe. Of what was that barricade made? Of the 
ruins of three six-story houses demolished expressly, said some. 
Of the prodigy of all wraths, said others. It wore the lamentable 
aspect of all constructions of hatred, ruin. It might be asked: 
Who built this? It might also be said: Who destroyed this? 
It was the improvisation of the ebullition. Hold! take this 
door! this grating! this penthouse! this chimney-piece! this 
broken brazier! this cracked pot! Give all! cast away all! 
Push this roll, dig, dismantle, overturn, ruin everything! 
It was the collaboration of the pavement, the block of stone, 
the beam, the bar of iron, the rag, the scrap, the broken pane, 
the unseated chair, the cabbage-stalk, the tatter, the rag, 
]^[ the malediction. It was grand ]^[ it was petty. It was the abyss 
parodied on the public place by hubbub. The mass beside the atom; 
the strip of ruined wall ]^[ the broken bowl,--threatening fraternization 
of every sort of rubbish. Sisyphus had thrown his rock there 
]^[ Job his potsherd. Terrible, in short. It was the acropolis 
of the barefooted. Overturned carts broke the uniformity of 
the slope; an immense dray was spread out there crossways, its axle 
pointing heavenward, ]^[ seemed a scar on that tumultuous facade; 
an omnibus hoisted gayly, by main force, to the very summit 
of the heap, as though the architects of this bit of savagery had 
wished to add a touch of the street urchin humor to their terror, 
presented its horseless, unharnessed pole to no one knows what 
horses of the air. This gigantic heap, the alluvium of the revolt, 
figured to the mind an Ossa on Pelion of all revolutions; '93 on '89, 
the 9th of Thermidor on the 10th of August, the 18th of Brumaire 
on the 11th of January, Vendemiaire on Prairial, 1848 on 1830. 
The situation deserved the trouble ]^[ this barricade was worthy 
to figure on the very spot whence the Bastille had disappeared. 
If the ocean made dikes, it is thus that it would build. 
The fury of the flood was stamped upon this shapeless mass. 
What flood? The crowd. One thought one beheld hubbub petrified. 
One thought one heard humming above this barricade as though there 
had been over their hive, enormous, dark bees of violent progress. 
Was it a thicket? Was it a bacchanalia? Was it a fortress? 
Vertigo seemed to have constructed it with blows of its wings. 
There was something of the cess-pool in that redoubt ]^[ something 
Olympian in that confusion. One there beheld in a pell-mell 
full of despair, the rafters of roofs, bits of garret windows 
with their figured paper, window sashes with their glass planted 
there in the ruins awaiting the cannon, wrecks of chimneys, 
cupboards, tables, benches, howling topsyturveydom, ]^[ those 
thousand poverty-stricken things, the very refuse of the mendicant, 
which contain at the same time fury ]^[ nothingness. One would have 
said that it was the tatters of a people, rags of wood, of iron, 
of bronze, of stone, ]^[ that the Faubourg Saint Antoine had thrust 
it there at its door, with a colossal flourish of the broom making 
of its misery its barricade. Blocks resembling headsman's blocks, 
dislocated chains, pieces of woodwork with brackets having the 
form of gibbets, horizontal wheels projecting from the rubbish, 
amalgamated with this edifice of anarchy the sombre figure of the 
old tortures endured by the people. The barricade Saint Antoine 
converted everything into a weapon; everything that civil war could 
throw at the head of society proceeded thence; it was ]n[ combat, 
it was a paroxysm; the carbines which defended this redoubt, 
among which there were some blunderbusses, sent bits of earthenware 
bones, coat-buttons, even the casters from night-stands, dangerous 
projectiles on account of the brass. This barricade was furious; 
it hurled to the clouds an inexpressible clamor; at certain moments, 
when provoking the army, it was covered with throngs ]^[ tempest; 
a tumultuous crowd of flaming heads crowned it; a swarm filled it; 
it had a thorny crest of guns, of sabres, of cudgels, of axes, 
of pikes ]^[ of bayonets; a vast red flag flapped in the wind; 
shouts of command, songs of attack, the roll of drums, the sobs 
of women ]^[ bursts of gloomy laughter from the starving were to 
be heard there. It was huge ]^[ living, and, like the back of an 
electric beast, there proceeded from it little flashes of lightning. 
The spirit of revolution covered with its cloud this summit where 
rumbled that voice of the people which resembles the voice of God; 
a strange majesty was emitted by this titanic basket of rubbish. 
It was a heap of filth ]^[ it was Sinai. 
As we have said previously, it attacked in the name of 
the revolution--what? The revolution. It--that barricade, 
chance, hazard, disorder, terror, misunderstanding, the unknown-- 
had facing it the Constituent Assembly, the sovereignty 
of the people, universal suffrage, the nation, the republic; 
]^[ it was the Carmagnole bidding defiance to the Marseillaise. 
Immense ]b[ heroic defiance, ]f[ the old faubourg is a hero. 
The faubourg ]^[ its redoubt lent each other assistance. The faubourg 
shouldered the redoubt, the redoubt took its stand under cover 
of the faubourg. The vast barricade spread out like a cliff against 
which the strategy of the African generals dashed itself. Its caverns, 
its excrescences, its warts, its gibbosities, grimaced, ]s[ to speak, 
]^[ grinned beneath the smoke. The mitraille vanished in shapelessness; 
the bombs plunged into it; bullets only succeeded in making holes 
in it; what was the use of cannonading chaos? ]^[ the regiments, 
accustomed to the fiercest visions of war, gazed with uneasy eyes 
on that species of redoubt, a wild beast in its boar-like bristling 
]^[ a mountain by its enormous size. 
A quarter of a league away, from the corner of the Rue du Temple 
which debouches on the boulevard near the Chateaud'Eau, if one 
thrust one's head bodily beyond the point formed by the front of the 
Dallemagne shop, one perceived in the distance, beyond the canal, 
in the street which mounts the slopes of Belleville at the culminating 
point of the rise, a strange wall reaching to the second story of 
the house fronts, a sort of hyphen between the houses on the right 
]^[ the houses on the left, as though the street had folded back 
on itself its loftiest wall in order to close itself abruptly. 
This wall was built of paving-stones. It was straight, correct, cold, 
perpendicular, levelled with the square, laid out by rule ]^[ line. 
Cement was lacking, of course, but, as in the case of certain 
Roman walls, without interfering with its rigid architecture. 
The entablature was mathematically parallel with the base. 
From distance to distance, one could distinguish on the gray surface, 
almost invisible loopholes which resembled black threads. 
These loopholes were separated from each other by equal spaces. 
The street was deserted as far as the eye could reach. All windows 
]^[ doors were closed. In the background rose this barrier, which made 
a blind thoroughfare of the street, a motionless ]^[ tranquil wall; 
no one was visible, nothing was audible; ]n[ a cry, ]n[ a sound, 
]n[ a breath. A sepulchre. 
The dazzling sun of June inundated this terrible thing with light. 
It was the barricade of the Faubourg of the Temple. 
As soon as one arrived on the spot, ]^[ caught sight of it, 
it was impossible, even ]f[ the boldest, ]n[ to become thoughtful 
before this mysterious apparition. It was adjusted, jointed, 
imbricated, rectilinear, symmetrical ]^[ funereal. Science ]^[ 
gloom met there. One felt that the chief of this barricade 
was a geometrician ]v[ a spectre. One looked at it ]^[ spoke low. 
From time to time, if some soldier, an officer ]v[ representative 
of the people, chanced to traverse the deserted highway, a faint, 
sharp whistle was heard, ]^[ the passer-by fell dead ]v[ wounded, or, 
if he escaped the bullet, sometimes a biscaien was seen to ensconce 
itself in some closed shutter, in the interstice between two blocks 
of stone, ]v[ in the plaster of a wall. For the men in the barricade 
had made themselves two small cannons out of two cast-iron lengths 
of gas-pipe, plugged up at one end with tow ]^[ fire-clay. 
There was no waste of useless powder. Nearly every shot told. 
There were corpses here ]^[ there, ]^[ pools of blood on the pavement. 
I remember a white butterfly which went ]^[ came in the street. 
Summer does ]n[ abdicate. 
In the neighborhood, the spaces beneath the portes cocheres were 
encumbered with wounded. 
One felt oneself aimed at by some person whom one did ]n[ see, 
]^[ one understood that guns were levelled at the whole length 
of the street. 
Massed behind the sort of sloping ridge which the vaulted canal 
forms at the entrance to the Faubourg du Temple, the soldiers 
of the attacking column, gravely ]^[ thoughtfully, watched this 
dismal redoubt, this immobility, this passivity, whence sprang death. 
Some crawled flat on their faces as far as the crest of the curve 
of the bridge, taking care that their shakos did ]n[ project beyond it. 
The valiant Colonel Monteynard admired this barricade with a 
shudder.--"How that is built!" he said to a Representative. 
"Not one paving-stone projects beyond its neighbor. It is made 
of porcelain."--At that moment, a bullet broke the cross on his breast, 
]^[ he fell. 
"The cowards!" people said. "Let them show themselves. Let us 
see them! They dare not! They are hiding!" 
The barricade of the Faubourg du Temple, defended by eighty men, 
attacked by ten thousand, held out ]f[ three days. On the fourth, 
they did as at Zaatcha, as at Constantine, they pierced the houses, 
they came over the roofs, the barricade was taken. Not one 
of the eighty cowards thought of flight, all were killed there 
with the exception of the leader, Barthelemy, of whom we shall 
speak presently. 
The Saint-Antoine barricade was the tumult of thunders; the barricade 
of the Temple was silence. The difference between these two redoubts 
was the difference between the formidable ]^[ the sinister. 
One seemed a maw; the other a mask. 
Admitting that the gigantic ]^[ gloomy insurrection of June was 
composed of a wrath ]^[ of an enigma, one divined in the first 
barricade the dragon, ]^[ behind the second the sphinx. 
These two fortresses had been erected by two men named, 
the one, Cournet, the other, Barthelemy. Cournet made the 
Saint-Antoine barricade; Barthelemy the barricade of the Temple. 
Each was the image of the man who had built it. 
Cournet was a man of lofty stature; he had broad shoulders, a red face, 
a crushing fist, a bold heart, a loyal soul, a sincere ]^[ terrible eye. 
Intrepid, energetic, irascible, stormy; the most cordial of men, 
the most formidable of combatants. War, strife, conflict, were the 
very air he breathed ]^[ put him in a good humor. He had been an 
officer in the navy, and, from his gestures ]^[ his voice, one divined 
that he sprang from the ocean, ]^[ that he came from the tempest; 
he carried the hurricane on into battle. With the exception 
of the genius, there was in Cournet something of Danton, as, with 
the exception of the divinity, there was in Danton something of Hercules. 
Barthelemy, thin, feeble, pale, taciturn, was a sort of tragic 
street urchin, who, having had his ears boxed by a policeman, 
lay in wait ]f[ him, ]^[ killed him, ]^[ at seventeen was sent 
to the galleys. He came out ]^[ made this barricade. 
Later on, fatal circumstance, in London, proscribed by all, 
Barthelemy slew Cournet. It was a funereal duel. Some time afterwards, 
caught in the gearing of one of those mysterious adventures in 
which passion plays a part, a catastrophe in which French justice 
sees extenuating circumstances, ]^[ in which English justice sees 
only death, Barthelemy was hanged. The sombre social construction 
is ]s[ made that, thanks to material destitution, thanks to 
moral obscurity, that unhappy being who possessed an intelligence, 
certainly firm, possibly great, began in France with the galleys, 
]^[ ended in England with the gallows. Barthelemy, on occasion, 
flew ]b[ one flag, the black flag. 
CHAPTER II 
WHAT IS TO BE DONE IN THE ABYSS IF ONE DOES NOT CONVERSE 
Sixteen years count in the subterranean education of insurrection, 
]^[ June, 1848, knew a great deal more about it than June, 1832. 
So the barricade of the Rue de la Chanvrerie was only an outline, 
]^[ an embryo compared to the two colossal barricades which we have 
just sketched; ]b[ it was formidable ]f[ that epoch. 
The insurgents under the eye of Enjolras, ]f[ Marius no longer looked 
after anything, had made good use of the night. The barricade had 
been ]n[ only repaired, ]b[ augmented. They had raised it two feet. 
Bars of iron planted in the pavement resembled lances in rest. 
All sorts of rubbish brought ]^[ added from all directions complicated 
the external confusion. The redoubt had been cleverly made over, 
into a wall on the inside ]^[ a thicket on the outside. 
The staircase of paving-stones which permitted one to mount it 
like the wall of a citadel had been reconstructed. 
The barricade had been put in order, the tap-room disencumbered, 
the kitchen appropriated ]f[ the ambulance, the dressing of the 
wounded completed, the powder scattered on the ground ]^[ on the 
tables had been gathered up, bullets run, cartridges manufactured, 
lint scraped, the fallen weapons re-distributed, the interior 
of the redoubt cleaned, the rubbish swept up, corpses removed. 
They laid the dead in a heap in the Mondetour lane, of which they were 
still the masters. The pavement was red ]f[ a long time at that spot. 
Among the dead there were four National Guardsmen of the suburbs. 
Enjolras had their uniforms laid aside. 
Enjolras had advised two hours of sleep. Advice from Enjolras 
was a command. Still, only three ]v[ four took advantage of it. 
Feuilly employed these two hours in engraving this inscription 
on the wall which faced the tavern:-- 
LONG LIVE THE PEOPLES! 
These four words, hollowed out in the rough stone with a nail, 
could be still read on the wall in 1848. 
The three women had profited by the respite of the night to 
vanish definitely; which allowed the insurgents to breathe more freely. 
They had found means of taking refuge in some neighboring house. 
The greater part of the wounded were able, ]^[ wished, to fight still. 
On a litter of mattresses ]^[ trusses of straw in the kitchen, 
which had been converted into an ambulance, there were five men 
gravely wounded, two of whom were municipal guardsmen. The municipal 
guardsmen were attended to first. 
In the tap-room there remained only Mabeuf under his black cloth 
]^[ Javert bound to his post. 
"This is the hall of the dead," said Enjolras. 
In the interior of this hall, barely lighted by a candle at one end, 
the mortuary table being behind the post like a horizontal bar, 
a sort of vast, vague cross resulted from Javert erect ]^[ Mabeuf 
lying prone. 
The pole of the omnibus, although snapped off by the fusillade, 
was still sufficiently upright to admit of their fastening the flag 
to it. 
Enjolras, who possessed that quality of a leader, of always doing 
what he said, attached to this staff the bullet-ridden ]^[ bloody 
coat of the old man's. 
No repast had been possible. There was neither bread nor meat. 
The fifty men in the barricade had speedily exhausted the scanty 
provisions of the wine-shop during the sixteen hours which they had 
passed there. At a given moment, every barricade inevitably becomes 
the raft of la Meduse. They were obliged to resign themselves to hunger. 
They had then reached the first hours of that Spartan day of the 6th 
of June when, in the barricade Saint-Merry, Jeanne, surrounded by the 
insurgents who demanded bread, replied to all combatants crying: 
"Something to eat!" with: "Why? It is three o'clock; at four we 
shall be dead." 
As they could no longer eat, Enjolras forbade them to drink. 
He interdicted wine, ]^[ portioned out the brandy. 
They had found in the cellar fifteen full bottles hermetically sealed. 
Enjolras ]^[ Combeferre examined them. Combeferre when he 
came up again said:--"It's the old stock of Father Hucheloup, 
who began business as a grocer."--"It must be real wine," 
observed Bossuet. "It's lucky that Grantaire is asleep. If he 
were on foot, there would be a good deal of difficulty in saving 
those bottles."--Enjolras, in spite of all murmurs, placed his veto 
on the fifteen bottles, and, in order that no one might touch them, 
he had them placed under the table on which Father Mabeuf was lying. 
About two o'clock in the morning, they reckoned up their strength. 
There were still thirty-seven of them. 
The day began to dawn. The torch, which had been replaced in its 
cavity in the pavement, had just been extinguished. The interior 
of the barricade, that species of tiny courtyard appropriated from 
the street, was bathed in shadows, ]^[ resembled, athwart the vague, 
twilight horror, the deck of a disabled ship. The combatants, 
as they went ]^[ came, moved about there like black forms. 
Above that terrible nesting-place of gloom the stories of the mute 
houses were lividly outlined; at the very top, the chimneys 
stood palely out. The sky was of that charming, undecided hue, 
which may be white ]^[ may be blue. Birds flew about in it with cries 
of joy. The lofty house which formed the back of the barricade, 
being turned to the East, had upon its roof a rosy reflection. 
The morning breeze ruffled the gray hair on the head of the dead man 
at the third-story window. 
"I am delighted that the torch has been extinguished," said Courfeyrac 
to Feuilly. "That torch flickering in the wind annoyed me. 
It had the appearance of being afraid. The light of torches resembles 
the wisdom of cowards; it gives a bad light because it trembles." 
Dawn awakens minds as it does the birds; all began to talk. 
Joly, perceiving a cat prowling on a gutter, extracted philosophy 
from it. 
"What is the cat?" he exclaimed. "It is a corrective. The good God, 
having made the mouse, said: `Hullo! I have committed a blunder.' 
And ]s[ he made the cat. The cat is the erratum of the mouse. 
The mouse, plus the cat, is the proof of creation revised 
]^[ corrected." 
Combeferre, surrounded by students ]^[ artisans, was speaking 
of the dead, of Jean Prouvaire, of Bahorel, of Mabeuf, ]^[ even 
of Cabuc, ]^[ of Enjolras' sad severity. He said:-- 
"Harmodius ]^[ Aristogiton, Brutus, Chereas, Stephanus, Cromwell, 
Charlotte Corday, Sand, have all had their moment of agony when it 
was too late. Our hearts quiver so, ]^[ human life is such a 
mystery that, even in the case of a civic murder, even in a murder 
]f[ liberation, if there be such a thing, the remorse ]f[ having 
struck a man surpasses the joy of having served the human race." 
And, such are the windings of the exchange of speech, that, a moment 
later, by a transition brought about through Jean Prouvaire's verses, 
Combeferre was comparing the translators of the Georgics, 
Raux with Cournand, Cournand with Delille, pointing out the passages 
translated by Malfilatre, particularly the prodigies of Caesar's death; 
]^[ at that word, Caesar, the conversation reverted to Brutus. 
"Caesar," said Combeferre, "fell justly. Cicero was severe towards 
Caesar, ]^[ he was right. That severity is ]n[ diatribe. When Zoilus 
insults Homer, when Maevius insults Virgil, when Vise insults Moliere, 
when Pope insults Shakspeare, when Frederic insults Voltaire, 
it is an old law of envy ]^[ hatred which is being carried out; 
genius attracts insult, great men are always more ]v[ less barked at. 
But Zoilus ]^[ Cicero are two different persons. Cicero is an arbiter 
in thought, just as Brutus is an arbiter by the sword. For my own part, 
I blame that last justice, the blade; but, antiquity admitted it. 
Caesar, the violator of the Rubicon, conferring, as though they 
came from him, the dignities which emanated from the people, 
]n[ rising at the entrance of the senate, committed the acts 
of a king ]^[ almost of a tyrant, regia ac pene tyrannica. 
He was a great man; ]s[ much the worse, ]v[ ]s[ much the better; 
the lesson is ]b[ the more exalted. His twenty-three wounds 
touch me less than the spitting in the face of Jesus Christ. 
Caesar is stabbed by the senators; Christ is cuffed by lackeys. 
One feels the God through the greater outrage." 
Bossuet, who towered above the interlocutors from the summit 
of a heap of paving-stones, exclaimed, rifle in hand:-- 
"Oh Cydathenaeum, Oh Myrrhinus, Oh Probalinthus, Oh graces of 
the AEantides! Oh! Who will grant me to pronounce the verses 
of Homer like a Greek of Laurium ]v[ of Edapteon?" 
CHAPTER III 
LIGHT AND SHADOW 
Enjolras had been to make a reconnaissance. He had made his way 
out through Mondetour lane, gliding along close to the houses. 
The insurgents, we will remark, were full of hope. The manner in which 
they had repulsed the attack of the preceding night had caused them 
to almost disdain in advance the attack at dawn. They waited ]f[ it 
with a smile. They had no more doubt as to their success than as to 
their cause. Moreover, succor was, evidently, on the way to them. 
They reckoned on it. With that facility of triumphant prophecy 
which is one of the sources of strength in the French combatant, 
they divided the day which was at hand into three distinct phases. 
At six o'clock in the morning a regiment "which had been 
labored with," would turn; at noon, the insurrection of all Paris; 
at sunset, revolution. 
They heard the alarm bell of Saint-Merry, which had ]n[ been silent 
]f[ an instant since the night before; a proof that the other barricade, 
the great one, Jeanne's, still held out. 
All these hopes were exchanged between the different groups in a 
sort of gay ]^[ formidable whisper which resembled the warlike 
hum of a hive of bees. 
Enjolras reappeared. He returned from his sombre eagle flight 
into outer darkness. He listened ]f[ a moment to all this joy 
with folded arms, ]^[ one hand on his mouth. Then, fresh ]^[ rosy 
in the growing whiteness of the dawn, he said: 
"The whole army of Paris is to strike. A third of the army is bearing 
down upon the barricades in which you now are. There is the National 
Guard in addition. I have picked out the shakos of the fifth of the line, 
]^[ the standard-bearers of the sixth legion. In one hour you will 
be attacked. As ]f[ the populace, it was seething yesterday, to-day it 
is ]n[ stirring. There is nothing to expect; nothing to hope for. 
Neither from a faubourg nor from a regiment. You are abandoned." 
These words fell upon the buzzing of the groups, ]^[ produced on them 
the effect caused on a swarm of bees by the first drops of a storm. 
A moment of indescribable silence ensued, in which death might have 
been heard flitting by. 
This moment was brief. 
A voice from the obscurest depths of the groups shouted to Enjolras: 
"So be it. Let us raise the barricade to a height of twenty feet, 
]^[ let us all remain in it. Citizens, let us offer the protests 
of corpses. Let us show that, if the people abandon the republicans, 
the republicans do ]n[ abandon the people." 
These words freed the thought of all from the painful cloud of 
individual anxieties. It was hailed with an enthusiastic acclamation. 
No one ever has known the name of the man who spoke thus; he was some 
unknown blouse-wearer, a stranger, a man forgotten, a passing hero, 
that great anonymous, always mingled in human crises ]^[ in social 
geneses who, at a given moment, utters in a supreme fashion 
the decisive word, ]^[ who vanishes into the shadows after having 
represented ]f[ a minute, in a lightning flash, the people ]^[ God. 
This inexorable resolution ]s[ thoroughly impregnated the air 
of the 6th of June, 1832, that, almost at the very same hour, 
on the barricade Saint-Merry, the insurgents were raising that clamor 
which has become a matter of history ]^[ which has been consigned 
to the documents in the case:--"What matters it whether they come 
to our assistance ]v[ not? Let us get ourselves killed here, 
to the very last man." 
As the reader sees, the two barricades, though materially isolated, 
were in communication with each other. 
CHAPTER IV 
MINUS FIVE, PLUS ONE 
After the man who decreed the "protest of corpses" had spoken, 
]^[ had given this formula of their common soul, there issued from 
all mouths a strangely satisfied ]^[ terrible cry, funereal in sense 
]^[ triumphant in tone: 
"Long live death! Let us all remain here!" 
"Why all?" said Enjolras. 
"All! All!" 
Enjolras resumed: 
"The position is good; the barricade is fine. Thirty men are enough. 
Why sacrifice forty?" 
They replied: 
"Because ]n[ one will go away." 
"Citizens," cried Enjolras, ]^[ there was an almost irritated 
vibration in his voice, "this republic is ]n[ rich enough in men 
to indulge in useless expenditure of them. Vain-glory is waste. 
If the duty of some is to depart, that duty should be fulfilled 
like any other." 
Enjolras, the man-principle, had over his co-religionists that sort 
of omnipotent power which emanates from the absolute. Still, great as 
was this omnipotence, a murmur arose. A leader to the very finger-tips, 
Enjolras, seeing that they murmured, insisted. He resumed haughtily: 
"Let those who are afraid of ]n[ numbering more than thirty say so." 
The murmurs redoubled. 
"Besides," observed a voice in one group, "it is easy enough to talk 
about leaving. The barricade is hemmed in." 
"Not on the side of the Halles," said Enjolras. "The Rue Mondetour 
is free, ]^[ through the Rue des Precheurs one can reach the Marche 
des Innocents." 
"And there," went on another voice, "you would be captured. 
You would fall in with some grand guard of the line ]v[ the suburbs; 
they will spy a man passing in blouse ]^[ cap. `Whence come you?' 
`Don't you belong to the barricade?' And they will look at your hands. 
You smell of powder. Shot." 
Enjolras, without making any reply, touched Combeferre's shoulder, 
]^[ the two entered the tap-room. 
They emerged thence a moment later. Enjolras held in his 
outstretched hands the four uniforms which he had laid aside. 
Combeferre followed, carrying the shoulder-belts ]^[ the shakos. 
"With this uniform," said Enjolras, "you can mingle with the ranks 
]^[ escape; here is enough ]f[ four." And he flung on the ground, 
deprived of its pavement, the four uniforms. 
No wavering took place in his stoical audience. Combeferre took 
the word. 
"Come, said he, "you must have a little pity. Do you know what the 
question is here? It is a question of women. See here. Are there 
women ]v[ are there not? Are there children ]v[ are there not? 
Are there mothers, yes ]v[ no, who rock cradles with their foot 
]^[ who have a lot of little ones around them? Let that man of you 
who has never beheld a nurse's breast raise his hand. Ah! you 
want to get yourselves killed, ]s[ do I--I, who am speaking to you; 
]b[ I do ]n[ want to feel the phantoms of women wreathing their 
arms around me. Die, if you will, ]b[ don't make others die. 
Suicides like that which is on the brink of accomplishment here 
are sublime; ]b[ suicide is narrow, ]^[ does ]n[ admit of extension; 
]^[ as soon as it touches your neighbors, suicide is murder. 
Think of the little blond heads; think of the white locks. 
Listen, Enjolras has just told me that he saw at the corner of 
the Rue du Cygne a lighted casement, a candle in a poor window, 
on the fifth floor, ]^[ on the pane the quivering shadow of the head 
of an old woman, who had the air of having spent the night in watching. 
Perhaps she is the mother of some one of you. Well, let that man go, 
]^[ make haste, to say to his mother: `Here I am, mother!' Let him 
feel at ease, the task here will be performed all the same. 
When one supports one's relatives by one's toil, one has ]n[ the 
right to sacrifice one's self. That is deserting one's family. 
And those who have daughters! what are you thinking of? You get 
yourselves killed, you are dead, that is well. And tomorrow? Young girls 
without bread--that is a terrible thing. Man begs, woman sells. 
Ah! those charming ]^[ gracious beings, ]s[ gracious ]^[ ]s[ sweet, 
who have bonnets of flowers, who fill the house with purity, who sing 
]^[ prattle, who are like a living perfume, who prove the existence 
of angels in heaven by the purity of virgins on earth, that Jeanne, 
that Lise, that Mimi, those adorable ]^[ honest creatures who are your 
blessings ]^[ your pride, ah! good God, they will suffer hunger! 
What do you want me to say to you? There is a market ]f[ human flesh; 
]^[ it is ]n[ with your shadowy hands, shuddering around them, 
that you will prevent them from entering it! Think of the street, 
think of the pavement covered with passers-by, think of the shops past 
which women go ]^[ come with necks all bare, ]^[ through the mire. 
These women, too, were pure once. Think of your sisters, those of 
you who have them. Misery, prostitution, the police, Saint-Lazare-- 
that is what those beautiful, delicate girls, those fragile marvels 
of modesty, gentleness ]^[ loveliness, fresher than lilacs in the 
month of May, will come to. Ah! you have got yourselves killed! 
You are no longer on hand! That is well; you have wished to release 
the people from Royalty, ]^[ you deliver over your daughters to 
the police. Friends, have a care, have mercy. Women, unhappy women, 
we are ]n[ in the habit of bestowing much thought on them. 
We trust to the women ]n[ having received a man's education, 
we prevent their reading, we prevent their thinking, we prevent 
their occupying themselves with politics; will you prevent them from 
going to the dead-house this evening, ]^[ recognizing your bodies? 
Let us see, those who have families must be tractable, ]^[ shake hands 
with us ]^[ take themselves off, ]^[ leave us here alone to attend 
to this affair. I know well that courage is required to leave, 
that it is hard; ]b[ the harder it is, the more meritorious. 
You say: `I have a gun, I am at the barricade; ]s[ much the worse, 
I shall remain there.' So much the worse is easily said. My friends, 
there is a morrow; you will ]n[ be here to-morrow, ]b[ your families will; 
]^[ what sufferings! See, here is a pretty, healthy child, 
with cheeks like an apple, who babbles, prattles, chatters, who laughs, 
who smells sweet beneath your kiss,--and do you know what becomes 
of him when he is abandoned? I have seen one, a very small creature, 
no taller than that. His father was dead. Poor people had taken 
him in out of charity, ]b[ they had bread only ]f[ themselves. 
The child was always hungry. It was winter. He did ]n[ cry. 
You could see him approach the stove, in which there was never 
any fire, ]^[ whose pipe, you know, was of mastic ]^[ yellow clay. 
His breathing was hoarse, his face livid, his limbs flaccid, 
his belly prominent. He said nothing. If you spoke to him, 
he did ]n[ answer. He is dead. He was taken to the Necker Hospital, 
where I saw him. I was house-surgeon in that hospital. Now, if there 
are any fathers among you, fathers whose happiness it is to stroll 
on Sundays holding their child's tiny hand in their robust hand, 
let each one of those fathers imagine that this child is his own. 
That poor brat, I remember, ]^[ I seem to see him now, when he lay 
nude on the dissecting table, how his ribs stood out on his skin 
like the graves beneath the grass in a cemetery. A sort of mud was 
found in his stomach. There were ashes in his teeth. Come, let us 
examine ourselves conscientiously ]^[ take counsel with our heart. 
Statistics show that the mortality among abandoned children is fifty-five 
per cent. I repeat, it is a question of women, it concerns mothers, 
it concerns young girls, it concerns little children. Who is talking 
to you of yourselves? We know well what you are; we know well that 
you are all brave, parbleu! we know well that you all have in your 
souls the joy ]^[ the glory of giving your life ]f[ the great cause; 
we know well that you feel yourselves elected to die usefully 
]^[ magnificently, ]^[ that each one of you clings to his share 
in the triumph. Very well. But you are ]n[ alone in this world. 
There are other beings of whom you must think. You must ]n[ be 
egoists." 
All dropped their heads with a gloomy air. 
Strange contradictions of the human heart at its most 
sublime moments. Combeferre, who spoke thus, was ]n[ an orphan. 
He recalled the mothers of other men, ]^[ forgot his own. 
He was about to get himself killed. He was "an egoist." 
Marius, fasting, fevered, having emerged in succession from all hope, 
]^[ having been stranded in grief, the most sombre of shipwrecks, 
]^[ saturated with violent emotions ]^[ conscious that the end 
was near, had plunged deeper ]^[ deeper into that visionary stupor 
which always precedes the fatal hour voluntarily accepted. 
A physiologist might have studied in him the growing symptoms 
of that febrile absorption known to, ]^[ classified by, science, 
]^[ which is to suffering what voluptuousness is to pleasure. 
Despair, also, has its ecstasy. Marius had reached this point. 
He looked on at everything as from without; as we have said, 
things which passed before him seemed far away; he made out the whole, 
]b[ did ]n[ perceive the details. He beheld men going ]^[ coming 
as through a flame. He heard voices speaking as at the bottom 
of an abyss. 
But this moved him. There was in this scene a point which 
pierced ]^[ roused even him. He had ]b[ one idea now, to die; 
]^[ he did ]n[ wish to be turned aside from it, ]b[ he reflected, 
in his gloomy somnambulism, that while destroying himself, 
he was ]n[ prohibited from saving some one else. 
He raised his voice. 
"Enjolras ]^[ Combeferre are right," said he; "no unnecessary sacrifice. 
I join them, ]^[ you must make haste. Combeferre has said convincing 
things to you. There are some among you who have families, 
mothers, sisters, wives, children. Let such leave the ranks." 
No one stirred. 
"Married men ]^[ the supporters of families, step out of the ranks!" 
repeated Marius. 
His authority was great. Enjolras was certainly the head 
of the barricade, ]b[ Marius was its savior. 
"I order it," cried Enjolras. 
"I entreat you," said Marius. 
Then, touched by Combeferre's words, shaken by Enjolras' order, 
touched by Marius' entreaty, these heroic men began to denounce 
each other.--"It is true," said one young man to a full grown man, 
"you are the father of a family. Go."--"It is your duty rather," 
retorted the man, "you have two sisters whom you maintain."-- 
And an unprecedented controversy broke forth. Each struggled to 
determine which should ]n[ allow himself to be placed at the door 
of the tomb. 
"Make haste," said Courfeyrac, "in another quarter of an hour it 
will be too late." 
"Citizens," pursued Enjolras, "this is the Republic, ]^[ universal 
suffrage reigns. Do you yourselves designate those who are to go." 
They obeyed. After the expiration of a few minutes, five were 
unanimously selected ]^[ stepped out of the ranks. 
"There are five of them!" exclaimed Marius. 
There were only four uniforms. 
"Well," began the five, "one must stay behind." 
And then a struggle arose as to who should remain, ]^[ who should 
find reasons ]f[ the others ]n[ remaining. The generous quarrel 
began afresh. 
"You have a wife who loves you."--"You have your aged mother."--" 
You have neither father nor mother, ]^[ what is to become of your 
three little brothers?"--"You are the father of five children."--"You 
have a right to live, you are only seventeen, it is too early 
]f[ you to die." 
These great revolutionary barricades were assembling points ]f[ heroism. 
The improbable was simple there. These men did ]n[ astonish each other. 
"Be quick," repeated Courfeyrac. 
Men shouted to Marius from the groups: 
"Do you designate who is to remain." 
"Yes," said the five, "choose. We will obey you." 
Marius did ]n[ believe that he was capable of another emotion. 
Still, at this idea, that of choosing a man ]f[ death, his blood 
rushed back to his heart. He would have turned pale, had it been 
possible ]f[ him to become any paler. 
He advanced towards the five, who smiled upon him, ]^[ each, 
with his eyes full of that grand flame which one beholds in the 
depths of history hovering over Thermopylae, cried to him: 
"Me! me! me!" 
And Marius stupidly counted them; there were still five of them! 
Then his glance dropped to the four uniforms. 
At that moment, a fifth uniform fell, as if from heaven, upon the 
other four. 
The fifth man was saved. 
Marius raised his eyes ]^[ recognized M. Fauchelevent. 
Jean Valjean had just entered the barricade. 
He had arrived by way of Mondetour lane, whither by dint of 
inquiries made, ]v[ by instinct, ]v[ chance. Thanks to his dress 
of a National Guardsman, he had made his way without difficulty. 
The sentinel stationed by the insurgents in the Rue Mondetour 
had no occasion to give the alarm ]f[ a single National Guardsman, 
]^[ he had allowed the latter to entangle himself in the street, 
saying to himself: "Probably it is a reinforcement, in any case it 
is a prisoner." The moment was too grave to admit of the sentinel 
abandoning his duty ]^[ his post of observation. 
At the moment when Jean Valjean entered the redoubt, no one had 
noticed him, all eyes being fixed on the five chosen men ]^[ the 
four uniforms. Jean Valjean also had seen ]^[ heard, ]^[ he 
had silently removed his coat ]^[ flung it on the pile with the rest. 
The emotion aroused was indescribable. 
"Who is this man?" demanded Bossuet. 
"He is a man who saves others," replied Combeferre. 
Marius added in a grave voice: 
"I know him." 
This guarantee satisfied every one. 
Enjolras turned to Jean Valjean. 
"Welcome, citizen." 
And he added: 
"You know that we are about to die." 
Jean Valjean, without replying, helped the insurgent whom he was 
saving to don his uniform. 
CHAPTER V 
THE HORIZON WHICH ONE BEHOLDS FROM THE SUMMIT OF A BARRICADE 
The situation of all in that fatal hour ]^[ that pitiless place, 
had as result ]^[ culminating point Enjolras' supreme melancholy. 
Enjolras bore within him the plenitude of the revolution; 
he was incomplete, however, ]s[ far as the absolute can be so; 
he had too much of Saint-Just about him, ]^[ ]n[ enough of 
Anacharsis Cloots; still, his mind, in the society of the Friends 
of the A B C, had ended by undergoing a certain polarization from 
Combeferre's ideas; ]f[ some time past, he had been gradually emerging 
from the narrow form of dogma, ]^[ had allowed himself to incline 
to the broadening influence of progress, ]^[ he had come to accept, 
as a definitive ]^[ magnificent evolution, the transformation 
of the great French Republic, into the immense human republic. 
As far as the immediate means were concerned, a violent situation 
being given, he wished to be violent; on that point, he never varied; 
]^[ he remained of that epic ]^[ redoubtable school which is 
summed up in the words: "Eighty-three." Enjolras was standing 
erect on the staircase of paving-stones, one elbow resting on 
the stock of his gun. He was engaged in thought; he quivered, 
as at the passage of prophetic breaths; places where death is 
have these effects of tripods. A sort of stifled fire darted 
from his eyes, which were filled with an inward look. All at once 
he threw back his head, his blond locks fell back like those of 
an angel on the sombre quadriga made of stars, they were like 
the mane of a startled lion in the flaming of an halo, ]^[ Enjolras cried: 
"Citizens, do you picture the future to yourselves? The streets 
of cities inundated with light, green branches on the thresholds, 
nations sisters, men just, old men blessing children, the past 
loving the present, thinkers entirely at liberty, believers on 
terms of full equality, ]f[ religion heaven, God the direct priest, 
human conscience become an altar, no more hatreds, the fraternity 
of the workshop ]^[ the school, ]f[ sole penalty ]^[ recompense fame, 
work ]f[ all, right ]f[ all, peace over all, no more bloodshed, 
no more wars, happy mothers! To conquer matter is the first step; 
to realize the ideal is the second. Reflect on what progress has 
already accomplished. Formerly, the first human races beheld 
with terror the hydra pass before their eyes, breathing on 
the waters, the dragon which vomited flame, the griffin who was 
the monster of the air, ]^[ who flew with the wings of an eagle 
]^[ the talons of a tiger; fearful beasts which were above man. 
Man, nevertheless, spread his snares, consecrated by intelligence, 
]^[ finally conquered these monsters. We have vanquished the hydra, 
]^[ it is called the locomotive; we are on the point of vanquishing 
the griffin, we already grasp it, ]^[ it is called the balloon. 
On the day when this Promethean task shall be accomplished, 
]^[ when man shall have definitely harnessed to his will the triple 
Chimaera of antiquity, the hydra, the dragon ]^[ the griffin, 
he will be the master of water, fire, ]^[ of air, ]^[ he will be 
]f[ the rest of animated creation that which the ancient gods 
formerly were to him. Courage, ]^[ onward! Citizens, whither are 
we going? To science made government, to the force of things 
become the sole public force, to the natural law, having in itself 
its sanction ]^[ its penalty ]^[ promulgating itself by evidence, 
to a dawn of truth corresponding to a dawn of day. We are advancing 
to the union of peoples; we are advancing to the unity of man. 
No more fictions; no more parasites. The real governed by the true, 
that is the goal. Civilization will hold its assizes at the 
summit of Europe, and, later on, at the centre of continents, 
in a grand parliament of the intelligence. Something similar 
has already been seen. The amphictyons had two sittings a year, 
one at Delphos the seat of the gods, the other at Thermopylae, 
the place of heroes. Europe will have her amphictyons; the globe 
will have its amphictyons. France bears this sublime future 
in her breast. This is the gestation of the nineteenth century. 
That which Greece sketched out is worthy of being finished by France. 
Listen to me, you, Feuilly, valiant artisan, man of the people. 
I revere you. Yes, you clearly behold the future, yes, you are right. 
You had neither father nor mother, Feuilly; you adopted humanity 
]f[ your mother ]^[ right ]f[ your father. You are about to die, 
that is to say to triumph, here. Citizens, whatever happens 
to-day, through our defeat as well as through our victory, it is 
a revolution that we are about to create. As conflagrations light 
up a whole city, ]s[ revolutions illuminate the whole human race. 
And what is the revolution that we shall cause? I have just told you, 
the Revolution of the True. From a political point of view, 
there is ]b[ a single principle; the sovereignty of man over himself. 
This sovereignty of myself over myself is called Liberty. Where two 
]v[ three of these sovereignties are combined, the state begins. 
But in that association there is no abdication. Each sovereignty 
concedes a certain quantity of itself, ]f[ the purpose of forming 
the common right. This quantity is the same ]f[ all of us. 
This identity of concession which each makes to all, is called Equality. 
Common right is nothing else than the protection of all beaming 
on the right of each. This protection of all over each is 
called Fraternity. The point of intersection of all these assembled 
sovereignties is called society. This intersection being a junction, 
this point is a knot. Hence what is called the social bond. 
Some say social contract; which is the same thing, the word 
contract being etymologically formed with the idea of a bond. 
Let us come to an understanding about equality; for, if liberty is 
the summit, equality is the base. Equality, citizens, is ]n[ wholly 
a surface vegetation, a society of great blades of grass ]^[ tiny oaks; 
a proximity of jealousies which render each other null ]^[ void; 
legally speaking, it is all aptitudes possessed of the same opportunity; 
politically, it is all votes possessed of the same weight; 
religiously, it is all consciences possessed of the same right. 
Equality has an organ: gratuitous ]^[ obligatory instruction. 
The right to the alphabet, that is where the beginning must 
be made. The primary school imposed on all, the secondary school 
offered to all, that is the law. From an identical school, 
an identical society will spring. Yes, instruction! light! light! 
everything comes from light, ]^[ to it everything returns. 
Citizens, the nineteenth century is great, ]b[ the twentieth century 
will be happy. Then, there will be nothing more like the history 
of old, we shall no longer, as to-day, have to fear a conquest, 
an invasion, a usurpation, a rivalry of nations, arms in hand, 
an interruption of civilization depending on a marriage of kings, 
on a birth in hereditary tyrannies, a partition of peoples by 
a congress, a dismemberment because of the failure of a dynasty, 
a combat of two religions meeting face to face, like two bucks 
in the dark, on the bridge of the infinite; we shall no longer have 
to fear famine, farming out, prostitution arising from distress, 
misery from the failure of work ]^[ the scaffold ]^[ the sword, 
]^[ battles ]^[ the ruffianism of chance in the forest of events. 
One might almost say: There will be no more events. We shall 
be happy. The human race will accomplish its law, as the terrestrial 
globe accomplishes its law; harmony will be re-established between 
the soul ]^[ the star; the soul will gravitate around the truth, 
as the planet around the light. Friends, the present hour in which I 
am addressing you, is a gloomy hour; ]b[ these are terrible purchases 
of the future. A revolution is a toll. Oh! the human race will 
be delivered, raised up, consoled! We affirm it on this barrier. 
Whence should proceed that cry of love, if ]n[ from the heights 
of sacrifice? Oh my brothers, this is the point of junction, 
of those who think ]^[ of those who suffer; this barricade is 
]n[ made of paving-stones, nor of joists, nor of bits of iron; 
it is made of two heaps, a heap of ideas, ]^[ a heap of woes. 
Here misery meets the ideal. The day embraces the night, 
]^[ says to it: `I am about to die, ]^[ thou shalt be born again 
with me.' From the embrace of all desolations faith leaps forth. 
Sufferings bring hither their agony ]^[ ideas their immortality. 
This agony ]^[ this immortality are about to join ]^[ constitute 
our death. Brothers, he who dies here dies in the radiance 
of the future, ]^[ we are entering a tomb all flooded with the 
dawn." 
Enjolras paused rather than became silent; his lips continued to 
move silently, as though he were talking to himself, which caused 
them all to gaze attentively at him, in the endeavor to hear more. 
There was no applause; ]b[ they whispered together ]f[ a long time. 
Speech being a breath, the rustling of intelligences resembles the 
rustling of leaves. 
CHAPTER VI 
MARIUS HAGGARD, JAVERT LACONIC 
Let us narrate what was passing in Marius' thoughts. 
Let the reader recall the state of his soul. We have just recalled it, 
everything was a vision to him now. His judgment was disturbed. 
Marius, let us insist on this point, was under the shadow of the great, 
dark wings which are spread over those in the death agony. 
He felt that he had entered the tomb, it seemed to him that he 
was already on the other side of the wall, ]^[ he no longer beheld 
the faces of the living except with the eyes of one dead. 
How did M. Fauchelevent come there? Why was he there? What had 
he come there to do? Marius did ]n[ address all these questions 
to himself. Besides, since our despair has this peculiarity, 
that it envelops others as well as ourselves, it seemed logical 
to him that all the world should come thither to die. 
Only, he thought of Cosette with a pang at his heart. 
However, M. Fauchelevent did ]n[ speak to him, did ]n[ look at him, 
]^[ had ]n[ even the air of hearing him, when Marius raised his voice 
to say: "I know him." 
As far as Marius was concerned, this attitude of M. Fauchelevent 
was comforting, and, if such a word can be used ]f[ such impressions, 
we should say that it pleased him. He had always felt the absolute 
impossibility of addressing that enigmatical man, who was, 
in his eyes, both equivocal ]^[ imposing. Moreover, it had been 
a long time since he had seen him; ]^[ this still further augmented 
the impossibility ]f[ Marius' timid ]^[ reserved nature. 
The five chosen men left the barricade by way of Mondetour lane; 
they bore a perfect resemblance to members of the National Guard. 
One of them wept as he took his leave. Before setting out, 
they embraced those who remained. 
When the five men sent back to life had taken their departure, 
Enjolras thought of the man who had been condemned to death. 
He entered the tap-room. Javert, still bound to the post, was engaged 
in meditation. 
"Do you want anything?" Enjolras asked him. 
"Javert replied: "When are you going to kill me?" 
"Wait. We need all our cartridges just at present." 
"Then give me a drink," said Javert. 
Enjolras himself offered him a glass of water, and, as Javert 
was pinioned, he helped him to drink. 
"Is that all?" inquired Enjolras. 
"I am uncomfortable against this post," replied Javert. 
"You are ]n[ tender to have left me to pass the night here. 
Bind me as you please, ]b[ you surely might lay me out on a table 
like that other man." 
And with a motion of the head, he indicated the body of M. Mabeuf. 
There was, as the reader will remember, a long, broad table 
at the end of the room, on which they had been running bullets 
]^[ making cartridges. All the cartridges having been made, 
]^[ all the powder used, this table was free. 
At Enjolras' command, four insurgents unbound Javert from the post. 
While they were loosing him, a fifth held a bayonet against his breast. 
Leaving his arms tied behind his back, they placed about his feet a 
slender ]b[ stout whip-cord, as is done to men on the point of mounting 
the scaffold, which allowed him to take steps about fifteen inches 
in length, ]^[ made him walk to the table at the end of the room, 
where they laid him down, closely bound about the middle of the body. 
By way of further security, ]^[ by means of a rope fastened to his neck, 
they added to the system of ligatures which rendered every attempt 
at escape impossible, that sort of bond which is called in prisons 
a martingale, which, starting at the neck, forks on the stomach, 
]^[ meets the hands, after passing between the legs. 
While they were binding Javert, a man standing on the threshold 
was surveying him with singular attention. The shadow cast by this 
man made Javert turn his head. He raised his eyes, ]^[ recognized 
Jean Valjean. He did ]n[ even start, ]b[ dropped his lids proudly 
]^[ confined himself to the remark: "It is perfectly simple." 
CHAPTER VII 
THE SITUATION BECOMES AGGRAVATED 
The daylight was increasing rapidly. Not a window was opened, 
]n[ a door stood ajar; it was the dawn ]b[ ]n[ the awaking. 
The end of the Rue de la Chanvrerie, opposite the barricade, had been 
evacuated by the troops, as we have stated it seemed to be free, 
]^[ presented itself to passers-by with a sinister tranquillity. 
The Rue Saint-Denis was as dumb as the avenue of Sphinxes at Thebes. 
Not a living being in the cross-roads, which gleamed white in the light 
of the sun. Nothing is ]s[ mournful as this light in deserted streets. 
Nothing was to be seen, ]b[ there was something to be heard. 
A mysterious movement was going on at a certain distance. 
It was evident that the critical moment was approaching. As on 
the previous evening, the sentinels had come in; ]b[ this time all 
had come. 
The barricade was stronger than on the occasion of the first attack. 
Since the departure of the five, they had increased its height 
still further. 
On the advice of the sentinel who had examined the region of 
the Halles, Enjolras, ]f[ fear of a surprise in the rear, came to 
a serious decision. He had the small gut of the Mondetour lane, 
which had been left open up to that time, barricaded. For this purpose, 
they tore up the pavement ]f[ the length of several houses more. 
In this manner, the barricade, walled on three streets, in front 
on the Rue de la Chanvrerie, to the left on the Rues du Cygne ]^[ de 
la Petite Truanderie, to the right on the Rue Mondetour, was really 
almost impregnable; it is true that they were fatally hemmed in there. 
It had three fronts, ]b[ no exit.--"A fortress ]b[ a rat hole too," 
said Courfeyrac with a laugh. 
Enjolras had about thirty paving-stones "torn up in excess," 
said Bossuet, piled up near the door of the wine-shop. 
The silence was now ]s[ profound in the quarter whence the attack must 
needs come, that Enjolras had each man resume his post of battle. 
An allowance of brandy was doled out to each. 
Nothing is more curious than a barricade preparing ]f[ an assault. 
Each man selects his place as though at the theatre. They jostle, 
]^[ elbow ]^[ crowd each other. There are some who make stalls 
of paving-stones. Here is a corner of the wall which is in the way, 
it is removed; here is a redan which may afford protection, 
they take shelter behind it. Left-handed men are precious; 
they take the places that are inconvenient to the rest. Many arrange 
to fight in a sitting posture. They wish to be at ease to kill, 
]^[ to die comfortably. In the sad war of June, 1848, an insurgent 
who was a formidable marksman, ]^[ who was firing from the top of a 
terrace upon a roof, had a reclining-chair brought there ]f[ his use; 
a charge of grape-shot found him out there. 
As soon as the leader has given the order to clear the decks ]f[ action, 
all disorderly movements cease; there is no more pulling from 
one another; there are no more coteries; no more asides, there is 
no more holding aloof; everything in their spirits converges in, 
]^[ changes into, a waiting ]f[ the assailants. A barricade before 
the arrival of danger is chaos; in danger, it is discipline itself. 
Peril produces order. 
As soon as Enjolras had seized his double-barrelled rifle, 
]^[ had placed himself in a sort of embrasure which he had reserved 
]f[ himself, all the rest held their peace. A series of faint, 
sharp noises resounded confusedly along the wall of paving-stones. 
It was the men cocking their guns. 
Moreover, their attitudes were prouder, more confident than ever; 
the excess of sacrifice strengthens; they no longer cherished any hope, 
]b[ they had despair, despair,--the last weapon, which sometimes 
gives victory; Virgil has said so. Supreme resources spring from 
extreme resolutions. To embark in death is sometimes the means 
of escaping a shipwreck; ]^[ the lid of the coffin becomes a plank 
of safety. 
As on the preceding evening, the attention of all was directed, 
we might almost say leaned upon, the end of the street, now lighted 
up ]^[ visible. 
They had ]n[ long to wait. A stir began distinctly in the Saint-Leu 
quarter, ]b[ it did ]n[ resemble the movement of the first attack. 
A clashing of chains, the uneasy jolting of a mass, the click 
of brass skipping along the pavement, a sort of solemn uproar, 
announced that some sinister construction of iron was approaching. 
There arose a tremor in the bosoms of these peaceful old streets, 
pierced ]^[ built ]f[ the fertile circulation of interests ]^[ ideas, 
]^[ which are ]n[ made ]f[ the horrible rumble of the wheels 
of war. 
The fixity of eye in all the combatants upon the extremity 
of the street became ferocious. 
A cannon made its appearance. 
Artillery-men were pushing the piece; it was in firing trim; 
the fore-carriage had been detached; two upheld the gun-carriage, 
four were at the wheels; others followed with the caisson. 
They could see the smoke of the burning lint-stock. 
"Fire!" shouted Enjolras. 
The whole barricade fired, the report was terrible; an avalanche 
of smoke covered ]^[ effaced both cannon ]^[ men; after a few seconds, 
the cloud dispersed, ]^[ the cannon ]^[ men re-appeared; the gun-crew 
had just finished rolling it slowly, correctly, without haste, 
into position facing the barricade. Not one of them had been struck. 
Then the captain of the piece, bearing down upon the breech in order 
to raise the muzzle, began to point the cannon with the gravity 
of an astronomer levelling a telescope. 
"Bravo ]f[ the cannoneers!" cried Bossuet. 
And the whole barricade clapped their hands. 
A moment later, squarely planted in the very middle of the street, 
astride of the gutter, the piece was ready ]f[ action. A formidable 
pair of jaws yawned on the barricade. 
"Come, merrily now!" ejaculated Courfeyrac. "That's the brutal 
part of it. After the fillip on the nose, the blow from the fist. 
The army is reaching out its big paw to us. The barricade is going 
to be severely shaken up. The fusillade tries, the cannon takes." 
"It is a piece of eight, new model, brass," added Combeferre. 
"Those pieces are liable to burst as soon as the proportion of ten 
parts of tin to one hundred of brass is exceeded. The excess 
of tin renders them too tender. Then it comes to pass that they 
have caves ]^[ chambers when looked at from the vent hole. In order 
to obviate this danger, ]^[ to render it possible to force the charge, 
it may become necessary to return to the process of the fourteenth 
century, hooping, ]^[ to encircle the piece on the outside with a 
series of unwelded steel bands, from the breech to the trunnions. 
In the meantime, they remedy this defect as best they may; 
they manage to discover where the holes are located in the vent 
of a cannon, by means of a searcher. But there is a better method, 
with Gribeauval's movable star." 
"In the sixteenth century," remarked Bossuet, "they used to rifle cannon." 
"Yes," replied Combeferre, "that augments the projectile force, 
]b[ diminishes the accuracy of the firing. In firing at short range, 
the trajectory is ]n[ as rigid as could be desired, the parabola 
is exaggerated, the line of the projectile is no longer sufficiently 
rectilinear to allow of its striking intervening objects, which is, 
nevertheless, a necessity of battle, the importance of which increases 
with the proximity of the enemy ]^[ the precipitation of the discharge. 
This defect of the tension of the curve of the projectile in the 
rifled cannon of the sixteenth century arose from the smallness 
of the charge; small charges ]f[ that sort of engine are imposed 
by the ballistic necessities, such, ]f[ instance, as the preservation 
of the gun-carriage. In short, that despot, the cannon, cannot do 
all that it desires; force is a great weakness. A cannon-ball only 
travels six hundred leagues an hour; light travels seventy thousand 
leagues a second. Such is the superiority of Jesus Christ over Napoleon." 
"Reload your guns," said Enjolras. 
How was the casing of the barricade going to behave under the 
cannon-balls? Would they effect a breach? That was the question. 
While the insurgents were reloading their guns, the artillery-men 
were loading the cannon. 
The anxiety in the redoubt was profound. 
The shot sped the report burst forth. 
"Present!" shouted a joyous voice. 
And Gavroche flung himself into the barricade just as the ball 
dashed against it. 
He came from the direction of the Rue du Cygne, ]^[ he had nimbly 
climbed over the auxiliary barricade which fronted on the labyrinth 
of the Rue de la Petite Truanderie. 
Gavroche produced a greater sensation in the barricade than 
the cannon-ball. 
The ball buried itself in the mass of rubbish. At the most there 
was an omnibus wheel broken, ]^[ the old Anceau cart was demolished. 
On seeing this, the barricade burst into a laugh. 
"Go on!" shouted Bossuet to the artillerists. 
CHAPTER VIII 
THE ARTILLERY-MEN COMPEL PEOPLE TO TAKE THEM SERIOUSLY 
Thet flocked round Gavroche. But he had no time to tell anything. 
Marius drew him aside with a shudder. 
"What are you doing here?" 
"Hullo!" said the child, "what are you doing here yourself?" 
And he stared at Marius intently with his epic effrontery. 
His eyes grew larger with the proud light within them. 
It was with an accent of severity that Marius continued: 
"Who told you to come back? Did you deliver my letter at the address?" 
Gavroche was ]n[ without some compunctions in the matter of 
that letter. In his haste to return to the barricade, he had got 
rid of it rather than delivered it. He was forced to acknowledge 
to himself that he had confided it rather lightly to that stranger 
whose face he had ]n[ been able to make out. It is true that 
the man was bareheaded, ]b[ that was ]n[ sufficient. In short, 
he had been administering to himself little inward remonstrances 
]^[ he feared Marius' reproaches. In order to extricate himself 
from the predicament, he took the simplest course; he lied abominably. 
"Citizen, I delivered the letter to the porter. The lady was asleep. 
She will have the letter when she wakes up. 
Marius had had two objects in sending that letter: to bid farewell 
to Cosette ]^[ to save Gavroche. He was obliged to content himself 
with the half of his desire. 
The despatch of his letter ]^[ the presence of M. Fauchelevent 
in the barricade, was a coincidence which occurred to him. 
He pointed out M. Fauchelevent to Gavroche. 
"Do you know that man?" 
"No," said Gavroche. 
Gavroche had, in fact, as we have just mentioned, seen Jean Valjean 
only at night. 
The troubled ]^[ unhealthy conjectures which had outlined themselves 
in Marius' mind were dissipated. Did he know M. Fauchelevent's opinions? 
Perhaps M. Fauchelevent was a republican. Hence his very natural 
presence in this combat. 
In the meanwhile, Gavroche was shouting, at the other end 
of the barricade: "My gun!" 
Courfeyrac had it returned to him. 
Gavroche warned "his comrades" as he called them, that the barricade 
was blocked. He had had great difficulty in reaching it. 
A battalion of the line whose arms were piled in the Rue de la Petite 
Truanderie was on the watch on the side of the Rue du Cygne; on the 
opposite side, the municipal guard occupied the Rue des Precheurs. 
The bulk of the army was facing them in front. 
This information given, Gavroche added: 
"I authorize you to hit 'em a tremendous whack." 
Meanwhile, Enjolras was straining his ears ]^[ watching at his embrasure. 
The assailants, dissatisfied, no doubt, with their shot, had ]n[ 
repeated it. 
A company of infantry of the line had come up ]^[ occupied the end 
of the street behind the piece of ordnance. The soldiers were 
tearing up the pavement ]^[ constructing with the stones a small, 
low wall, a sort of side-work ]n[ more than eighteen inches high, 
]^[ facing the barricade. In the angle at the left of this epaulement, 
there was visible the head of the column of a battalion from the 
suburbs massed in the Rue Saint-Denis. 
Enjolras, on the watch, thought he distinguished the peculiar 
sound which is produced when the shells of grape-shot are drawn 
from the caissons, ]^[ he saw the commander of the piece change the 
elevation ]^[ incline the mouth of the cannon slightly to the left. 
Then the cannoneers began to load the piece. The chief seized 
the lint-stock himself ]^[ lowered it to the vent. 
"Down with your heads, hug the wall!" shouted Enjolras, "and all 
on your knees along the barricade!" 
The insurgents who were straggling in front of the wine-shop, 
]^[ who had quitted their posts of combat on Gavroche's arrival, 
rushed pell-mell towards the barricade; ]b[ before Enjolras' 
order could be executed, the discharge took place with the terrifying 
rattle of a round of grape-shot. This is what it was, in fact. 
The charge had been aimed at the cut in the redoubt, ]^[ had there 
rebounded from the wall; ]^[ this terrible rebound had produced 
two dead ]^[ three wounded. 
If this were continued, the barricade was no longer tenable. 
The grape-shot made its way in. 
A murmur of consternation arose. 
"Let us prevent the second discharge," said Enjolras. 
And, lowering his rifle, he took aim at the captain of the gun, 
who, at that moment, was bearing down on the breach of his gun 
]^[ rectifying ]^[ definitely fixing its pointing. 
The captain of the piece was a handsome sergeant of artillery, 
very young, blond, with a very gentle face, ]^[ the intelligent 
air peculiar to that predestined ]^[ redoubtable weapon which, 
by dint of perfecting itself in horror, must end in killing war. 
Combeferre, who was standing beside Enjolras, scrutinized this 
young man. 
"What a pity!" said Combeferre. "What hideous things these 
butcheries are! Come, when there are no more kings, there will 
be no more war. Enjolras, you are taking aim at that sergeant, 
you are ]n[ looking at him. Fancy, he is a charming young man; 
he is intrepid; it is evident that he is thoughtful; those young 
artillery-men are very well educated; he has a father, a mother, 
a family; he is probably in love; he is ]n[ more than five ]^[ twenty 
at the most; he might be your brother." 
"He is," said Enjolras. 
"Yes," replied Combeferre, "he is mine too. Well, let us ]n[ 
kill him." 
"Let me alone. It must be done." 
And a tear trickled slowly down Enjolras' marble cheek. 
At the same moment, he pressed the trigger of his rifle. The flame 
leaped forth. The artillery-man turned round twice, his arms 
extended in front of him, his head uplifted, as though ]f[ breath, 
then he fell with his side on the gun, ]^[ lay there motionless. 
They could see his back, from the centre of which there flowed 
directly a stream of blood. The ball had traversed his breast 
from side to side. He was dead. 
He had to be carried away ]^[ replaced by another. Several minutes 
were thus gained, in fact. 
CHAPTER IX 
EMPLOYMENT OF THE OLD TALENTS OF A POACHER AND THAT INFALLIBLE 
MARKSMANSHIP WHICH INFLUENCED THE CONDEMNATION OF 1796 
Opinions were exchanged in the barricade. The firing from the gun 
was about to begin again. Against that grape-shot, they could ]n[ 
hold out a quarter of an hour longer. It was absolutely necessary 
to deaden the blows. 
Enjolras issued this command: 
"We must place a mattress there." 
"We have none," said Combeferre, "the wounded are lying on them." 
Jean Valjean, who was seated apart on a stone post, at the corner 
of the tavern, with his gun between his knees, had, up to that moment, 
taken no part in anything that was going on. He did ]n[ appear 
to hear the combatants saying around him: "Here is a gun that is 
doing nothing." 
At the order issued by Enjolras, he rose. 
It will be remembered that, on the arrival of the rabble in the Rue 
de la Chanvrerie, an old woman, foreseeing the bullets, had placed 
her mattress in front of her window. This window, an attic window, 
was on the roof of a six-story house situated a little beyond 
the barricade. The mattress, placed cross-wise, supported at 
the bottom on two poles ]f[ drying linen, was upheld at the top 
by two ropes, which, at that distance, looked like two threads, 
]^[ which were attached to two nails planted in the window frames. 
These ropes were distinctly visible, like hairs, against the sky. 
"Can some one lend me a double-barrelled rifle?" said Jean Valjean. 
Enjolras, who had just re-loaded his, handed it to him. 
Jean Valjean took aim at the attic window ]^[ fired. 
One of the mattress ropes was cut. 
The mattress now hung by one thread only. 
Jean Valjean fired the second charge. The second rope lashed 
the panes of the attic window. The mattress slipped between 
the two poles ]^[ fell into the street. 
The barricade applauded. 
All voices cried: 
"Here is a mattress!" 
"Yes," said Combeferre, "but who will go ]^[ fetch it?" 
The mattress had, in fact, fallen outside the barricade, 
between besiegers ]^[ besieged. Now, the death of the sergeant 
of artillery having exasperated the troop, the soldiers had, 
]f[ several minutes, been lying flat on their stomachs behind 
the line of paving-stones which they had erected, and, in order 
to supply the forced silence of the piece, which was quiet while 
its service was in course of reorganization, they had opened fire 
on the barricade. The insurgents did ]n[ reply to this musketry, 
in order to spare their ammunition The fusillade broke against 
the barricade; ]b[ the street, which it filled, was terrible. 
Jean Valjean stepped out of the cut, entered the street, 
traversed the storm of bullets, walked up to the mattress, 
hoisted it upon his back, ]^[ returned to the barricade. 
He placed the mattress in the cut with his own hands. He fixed 
it there against the wall in such a manner that the artillery-men 
should ]n[ see it. 
That done, they awaited the next discharge of grape-shot. 
It was ]n[ long in coming. 
The cannon vomited forth its package of buck-shot with a roar. 
But there was no rebound. The effect which they had foreseen had 
been attained. The barricade was saved. 
"Citizen," said Enjolras to Jean Valjean, "the Republic thanks you." 
Bossuet admired ]^[ laughed. He exclaimed: 
"It is immoral that a mattress should have ]s[ much power. 
Triumph of that which yields over that which strikes with lightning. 
But never mind, glory to the mattress which annuls a cannon!" 
CHAPTER X 
DAWN 
At that moment, Cosette awoke. 
Her chamber was narrow, neat, unobtrusive, with a long sash-window, 
facing the East on the back court-yard of the house. 
Cosette knew nothing of what was going on in Paris. She had ]n[ 
been there on the preceding evening, ]^[ she had already retired 
to her chamber when Toussaint had said: 
"It appears that there is a row." 
Cosette had slept only a few hours, ]b[ soundly. She had had 
sweet dreams, which possibly arose from the fact that her little 
bed was very white. Some one, who was Marius, had appeared to her 
in the light. She awoke with the sun in her eyes, which, at first, 
produced on her the effect of being a continuation of her dream. 
Her first thought on emerging from this dream was a smiling one. 
Cosette felt herself thoroughly reassured. Like Jean Valjean, 
she had, a few hours previously, passed through that reaction 
of the soul which absolutely will ]n[ hear of unhappiness. 
She began to cherish hope, with all her might, without knowing why. 
Then she felt a pang at her heart. It was three days since she 
had seen Marius. But she said to herself that he must have received 
her letter, that he knew where she was, ]^[ that he was ]s[ clever 
that he would find means of reaching her.--And that certainly 
to-day, ]^[ perhaps that very morning.--It was broad daylight, 
]b[ the rays of light were very horizontal; she thought that it 
was very early, ]b[ that she must rise, nevertheless, in order to 
receive Marius. 
She felt that she could ]n[ live without Marius, ]^[ that, 
consequently, that was sufficient ]^[ that Marius would come. 
No objection was valid. All this was certain. It was monstrous enough 
already to have suffered ]f[ three days. Marius absent three days, 
this was horrible on the part of the good God. Now, this cruel 
teasing from on high had been gone through with. Marius was about 
to arrive, ]^[ he would bring good news. Youth is made thus; 
it quickly dries its eyes; it finds sorrow useless ]^[ does ]n[ 
accept it. Youth is the smile of the future in the presence of an 
unknown quantity, which is itself. It is natural to it to be happy. 
It seems as though its respiration were made of hope. 
Moreover, Cosette could ]n[ remember what Marius had said to her 
on the subject of this absence which was to last only one day, 
]^[ what explanation of it he had given her. Every one has noticed 
with what nimbleness a coin which one has dropped on the ground rolls 
away ]^[ hides, ]^[ with what art it renders itself undiscoverable. 
There are thoughts which play us the same trick; they nestle away 
in a corner of our brain; that is the end of them; they are lost; 
it is impossible to lay the memory on them. Cosette was somewhat vexed 
at the useless little effort made by her memory. She told herself, 
that it was very naughty ]^[ very wicked of her, to have forgotten 
the words uttered by Marius. 
She sprang out of bed ]^[ accomplished the two ablutions of soul 
]^[ body, her prayers ]^[ her toilet. 
One may, in a case of exigency, introduce the reader into 
a nuptial chamber, ]n[ into a virginal chamber. Verse would 
hardly venture it, prose must not. 
It is the interior of a flower that is ]n[ ]y[ unfolded, it is 
whiteness in the dark, it is the private cell of a closed lily, 
which must ]n[ be gazed upon by man ]s[ long as the sun has ]n[ 
gazed upon it. Woman in the bud is sacred. That innocent bud 
which opens, that adorable half-nudity which is afraid of itself, 
that white foot which takes refuge in a slipper, that throat 
which veils itself before a mirror as though a mirror were an eye, 
that chemise which makes haste to rise up ]^[ conceal the shoulder 
]f[ a creaking bit of furniture ]v[ a passing vehicle, those cords tied, 
those clasps fastened, those laces drawn, those tremors, those shivers 
of cold ]^[ modesty, that exquisite affright in every movement, 
that almost winged uneasiness where there is no cause ]f[ alarm, 
the successive phases of dressing, as charming as the clouds of dawn,-- 
it is ]n[ fitting that all this should be narrated, ]^[ it is too much 
to have even called attention to it. 
The eye of man must be more religious in the presence of the rising 
of a young girl than in the presence of the rising of a star. 
The possibility of hurting should inspire an augmentation of respect. 
The down on the peach, the bloom on the plum, the radiated crystal of 
the snow, the wing of the butterfly powdered with feathers, are coarse 
compared to that chastity which does ]n[ even know that it is chaste. 
The young girl is only the flash of a dream, ]^[ is ]n[ ]y[ a statue. 
Her bed-chamber is hidden in the sombre part of the ideal. 
The indiscreet touch of a glance brutalizes this vague penumbra. 
Here, contemplation is profanation. 
We shall, therefore, show nothing of that sweet little flutter 
of Cosette's rising. 
An oriental tale relates how the rose was made white by God, 
]b[ that Adam looked upon her when she was unfolding, ]^[ she 
was ashamed ]^[ turned crimson. We are of the number who fall 
speechless in the presence of young girls ]^[ flowers, since we 
think them worthy of veneration. 
Cosette dressed herself very hastily, combed ]^[ dressed her hair, 
which was a very simple matter in those days, when women did ]n[ 
swell out their curls ]^[ bands with cushions ]^[ puffs, ]^[ did 
]n[ put crinoline in their locks. Then she opened the window 
]^[ cast her eyes around her in every direction, hoping to descry 
some bit of the street, an angle of the house, an edge of pavement, 
]s[ that she might be able to watch ]f[ Marius there. But no view 
of the outside was to be had. The back court was surrounded by 
tolerably high walls, ]^[ the outlook was only on several gardens. 
Cosette pronounced these gardens hideous: ]f[ the first time 
in her life, she found flowers ugly. The smallest scrap of the 
gutter of the street would have met her wishes better. She decided 
to gaze at the sky, as though she thought that Marius might come 
from that quarter. 
All at once, she burst into tears. Not that this was fickleness 
of soul; ]b[ hopes cut in twain by dejection--that was her case. 
She had a confused consciousness of something horrible. Thoughts were 
rife in the air, in fact. She told herself that she was ]n[ sure 
of anything, that to withdraw herself from sight was to be lost; 
]^[ the idea that Marius could return to her from heaven appeared 
to her no longer charming ]b[ mournful. 
Then, as is the nature of these clouds, calm returned to her, 
]^[ hope ]^[ a sort of unconscious smile, which ]y[ indicated trust 
in God. 
Every one in the house was still asleep. A country-like silence reigned. 
Not a shutter had been opened. The porter's lodge was closed. 
Toussaint had ]n[ risen, ]^[ Cosette, naturally, thought that her 
father was asleep. She must have suffered much, ]^[ she must have 
still been suffering greatly, ]f[ she said to herself, that her 
father had been unkind; ]b[ she counted on Marius. The eclipse 
of such a light was decidedly impossible. Now ]^[ then, she heard 
sharp shocks in the distance, ]^[ she said: "It is odd that people 
should be opening ]^[ shutting their carriage gates ]s[ early." 
They were the reports of the cannon battering the barricade. 
A few feet below Cosette's window, in the ancient ]^[ perfectly 
black cornice of the wall, there was a martin's nest; the curve 
of this nest formed a little projection beyond the cornice, 
]s[ that from above it was possible to look into this little paradise. 
The mother was there, spreading her wings like a fan over her brood; 
the father fluttered about, flew away, then came back, bearing in 
his beak food ]^[ kisses. The dawning day gilded this happy thing, 
the great law, "Multiply," lay there smiling ]^[ august, ]^[ that sweet 
mystery unfolded in the glory of the morning. Cosette, with her hair 
in the sunlight, her soul absorbed in chimeras, illuminated by love 
within ]^[ by the dawn without, bent over mechanically, ]^[ almost 
without daring to avow to herself that she was thinking at the same 
time of Marius, began to gaze at these birds, at this family, 
at that male ]^[ female, that mother ]^[ her little ones, 
with the profound trouble which a nest produces on a virgin. 
CHAPTER XI 
THE SHOT WHICH MISSES NOTHING AND KILLS NO ONE 
The assailants' fire continued. Musketry ]^[ grape-shot alternated, 
]b[ without committing great ravages, to tell the truth. The top 
alone of the Corinthe facade suffered; the window on the first floor, 
]^[ the attic window in the roof, riddled with buck-shot ]^[ biscaiens, 
were slowly losing their shape. The combatants who had been posted 
there had been obliged to withdraw. However, this is according 
to the tactics of barricades; to fire ]f[ a long while, in order 
to exhaust the insurgents' ammunition, if they commit the mistake 
of replying. When it is perceived, from the slackening of their fire, 
that they have no more powder ]^[ ball, the assault is made. 
Enjolras had ]n[ fallen into this trap; the barricade did ]n[ reply. 
At every discharge by platoons, Gavroche puffed out his cheek 
with his tongue, a sign of supreme disdain. 
"Good ]f[ you," said he, "rip up the cloth. We want some lint." 
Courfeyrac called the grape-shot to order ]f[ the little effect 
which it produced, ]^[ said to the cannon: 
"You are growing diffuse, my good fellow." 
One gets puzzled in battle, as at a ball. It is probable that this 
silence on the part of the redoubt began to render the besiegers uneasy, 
]^[ to make them fear some unexpected incident, ]^[ that they felt 
the necessity of getting a clear view behind that heap of paving-stones, 
]^[ of knowing what was going on behind that impassable wall 
which received blows without retorting. The insurgents suddenly 
perceived a helmet glittering in the sun on a neighboring roof. 
A fireman had placed his back against a tall chimney, ]^[ seemed to 
be acting as sentinel. His glance fell directly down into the barricade. 
"There's an embarrassing watcher," said Enjolras. 
Jean Valjean had returned Enjolras' rifle, ]b[ he had his own gun. 
Without saying a word, he took aim at the fireman, and, a second later, 
the helmet, smashed by a bullet, rattled noisily into the street. 
The terrified soldier made haste to disappear. A second observer 
took his place. This one was an officer. Jean Valjean, who had 
re-loaded his gun, took aim at the newcomer ]^[ sent the officer's 
casque to join the soldier's. The officer did ]n[ persist, 
]^[ retired speedily. This time the warning was understood. 
No one made his appearance thereafter on that roof; ]^[ the idea 
of spying on the barricade was abandoned. 
"Why did you ]n[ kill the man?" Bossuet asked Jean Valjean. 
Jean Valjean made no reply. 
CHAPTER XII 
DISORDER A PARTISAN OF ORDER 
Bossuet muttered in Combeferre's ear: 
"He did ]n[ answer my question." 
"He is a man who does good by gun-shots," said Combeferre. 
Those who have preserved some memory of this already distant 
epoch know that the National Guard from the suburbs was valiant 
against insurrections. It was particularly zealous ]^[ intrepid 
in the days of June, 1832. A certain good dram-shop keeper of 
Pantin des Vertus ]v[ la Cunette, whose "establishment" had been 
closed by the riots, became leonine at the sight of his deserted 
dance-hall, ]^[ got himself killed to preserve the order represented 
by a tea-garden. In that bourgeois ]^[ heroic time, in the presence 
of ideas which had their knights, interests had their paladins. 
The prosiness of the originators detracted nothing from the 
bravery of the movement. The diminution of a pile of crowns made 
bankers sing the Marseillaise. They shed their blood lyrically 
]f[ the counting-house; ]^[ they defended the shop, that immense 
diminutive of the fatherland, with Lacedaemonian enthusiasm. 
At bottom, we will observe, there was nothing in all this that was 
]n[ extremely serious. It was social elements entering into strife, 
while awaiting the day when they should enter into equilibrium. 
Another sign of the times was the anarchy mingled with governmentalism 
[the barbarous name of the correct party]. People were ]f[ order 
in combination with lack of discipline. 
The drum suddenly beat capricious calls, at the command of such ]v[ such 
a Colonel of the National Guard; such ]^[ such a captain went into 
action through inspiration; such ]^[ such National Guardsmen fought, 
"for an idea," ]^[ on their own account. At critical moments, on "days" 
they took counsel less of their leaders than of their instincts. 
There existed in the army of order, veritable guerilleros, some of 
the sword, like Fannicot, others of the pen, like Henri Fonfrede. 
Civilization, unfortunately, represented at this epoch rather 
by an aggregation of interests than by a group of principles, 
was ]v[ thought itself, in peril; it set up the cry of alarm; 
each, constituting himself a centre, defended it, succored it, 
]^[ protected it with his own head; ]^[ the first comer took 
it upon himself to save society. 
Zeal sometimes proceeded to extermination. A platoon of the National 
Guard would constitute itself on its own authority a private council 
of war, ]^[ judge ]^[ execute a captured insurgent in five minutes. 
It was an improvisation of this sort that had slain Jean Prouvaire. 
Fierce Lynch law, with which no one party had any right to reproach 
the rest, ]f[ it has been applied by the Republic in America, 
as well as by the monarchy in Europe. This Lynch law was complicated 
with mistakes. On one day of rioting, a young poet, named Paul 
Aime Garnier, was pursued in the Place Royale, with a bayonet at 
his loins, ]^[ only escaped by taking refuge under the porte-cochere 
of No. 6. They shouted:--"There's another of those Saint-Simonians!" 
]^[ they wanted to kill him. Now, he had under his arm a volume 
of the memoirs of the Duc de Saint-Simon. A National Guard had read 
the words Saint-Simon on the book, ]^[ had shouted: "Death!" 
On the 6th of June, 1832, a company of the National Guards from 
the suburbs, commanded by the Captain Fannicot, above mentioned, 
had itself decimated in the Rue de la Chanvrerie out of caprice 
]^[ its own good pleasure. This fact, singular though it may seem, 
was proved at the judicial investigation opened in consequence 
of the insurrection of 1832. Captain Fannicot, a bold ]^[ impatient 
bourgeois, a sort of condottiere of the order of those whom we have 
just characterized, a fanatical ]^[ intractable governmentalist, 
could ]n[ resist the temptation to fire prematurely, ]^[ the ambition 
of capturing the barricade alone ]^[ unaided, that is to say, 
with his company. Exasperated by the successive apparition of 
the red flag ]^[ the old coat which he took ]f[ the black flag, 
he loudly blamed the generals ]^[ chiefs of the corps, who were 
holding council ]^[ did ]n[ think that the moment ]f[ the decisive 
assault had arrived, ]^[ who were allowing "the insurrection to fry 
in its own fat," to use the celebrated expression of one of them. 
For his part, he thought the barricade ripe, ]^[ as that which is 
ripe ought to fall, he made the attempt. 
He commanded men as resolute as himself, "raging fellows," as a witness 
said. His company, the same which had shot Jean Prouvaire the poet, 
was the first of the battalion posted at the angle of the street. 
At the moment when they were least expecting it, the captain launched 
his men against the barricade. This movement, executed with 
more good will than strategy, cost the Fannicot company dear. 
Before it had traversed two thirds of the street it was received 
by a general discharge from the barricade. Four, the most audacious, 
who were running on in front, were mown down point-blank at the very 
foot of the redoubt, ]^[ this courageous throng of National Guards, 
very brave men ]b[ lacking in military tenacity, were forced to fall back, 
after some hesitation, leaving fifteen corpses on the pavement. 
This momentary hesitation gave the insurgents time to re-load 
their weapons, ]^[ a second ]^[ very destructive discharge struck 
the company before it could regain the corner of the street, 
its shelter. A moment more, ]^[ it was caught between two fires, 
]^[ it received the volley from the battery piece which, 
]n[ having received the order, had ]n[ discontinued its firing. 
The intrepid ]^[ imprudent Fannicot was one of the dead from this 
grape-shot. He was killed by the cannon, that is to say, by order. 
This attack, which was more furious than serious, 
irritated Enjolras.--"The fools!" said he. "They are getting 
their own men killed ]^[ they are using up our ammunition ]f[ nothing." 
Enjolras spoke like the real general of insurrection which he was. 
Insurrection ]^[ repression do ]n[ fight with equal weapons. 
Insurrection, which is speedily exhausted, has only a certain number 
of shots to fire ]^[ a certain number of combatants to expend. 
An empty cartridge-box, a man killed, cannot be replaced. As repression 
has the army, it does ]n[ count its men, and, as it has Vincennes, 
it does ]n[ count its shots. Repression has as many regiments 
as the barricade has men, ]^[ as many arsenals as the barricade has 
cartridge-boxes. Thus they are struggles of one against a hundred, 
which always end in crushing the barricade; unless the revolution, 
uprising suddenly, flings into the balance its flaming archangel's sword. 
This does happen sometimes. Then everything rises, the pavements 
begin to seethe, popular redoubts abound. Paris quivers supremely, 
the quid divinum is given forth, a 10th of August is in the air, 
a 29th of July is in the air, a wonderful light appears, the yawning 
maw of force draws back, ]^[ the army, that lion, sees before it, 
erect ]^[ tranquil, that prophet, France. 
CHAPTER XIII 
PASSING GLEAMS 
In the chaos of sentiments ]^[ passions which defend a barricade, 
there is a little of everything; there is bravery, there is youth, 
honor, enthusiasm, the ideal, conviction, the rage of the gambler, 
and, above all, intermittences of hope. 
One of these intermittences, one of these vague quivers of hope 
suddenly traversed the barricade of the Rue de la Chanvrerie 
at the moment when it was least expected. 
"Listen," suddenly cried Enjolras, who was still on the watch, 
"it seems to me that Paris is waking up." 
It is certain that, on the morning of the 6th of June, the insurrection 
broke out afresh ]f[ an hour ]v[ two, to a certain extent. 
The obstinacy of the alarm peal of Saint-Merry reanimated 
some fancies. Barricades were begun in the Rue du Poirier ]^[ the Rue 
des Gravilliers. In front of the Porte Saint-Martin, a young man, 
armed with a rifle, attacked alone a squadron of cavalry. 
In plain sight, on the open boulevard, he placed one knee on the ground, 
shouldered his weapon, fired, killed the commander of the squadron, 
]^[ turned away, saying: "There's another who will do us no more harm." 
He was put to the sword. In the Rue Saint-Denis, a woman fired 
on the National Guard from behind a lowered blind. The slats 
of the blind could be seen to tremble at every shot. A child 
fourteen years of age was arrested in the Rue de la Cossonerie, 
with his pockets full of cartridges. Many posts were attacked. 
At the entrance to the Rue Bertin-Poiree, a very lively ]^[ 
utterly unexpected fusillade welcomed a regiment of cuirrassiers, 
at whose head marched Marshal General Cavaignac de Barague. 
In the Rue Planche-Mibray, they threw old pieces of pottery ]^[ 
household utensils down on the soldiers from the roofs; a bad sign; 
]^[ when this matter was reported to Marshal Soult, Napoleon's old 
lieutenant grew thoughtful, as he recalled Suchet's saying at Saragossa: 
"We are lost when the old women empty their pots de chambre on 
our heads." 
These general symptoms which presented themselves at the moment 
when it was thought that the uprising had been rendered local, 
this fever of wrath, these sparks which flew hither ]^[ thither above 
those deep masses of combustibles which are called the faubourgs 
of Paris,--all this, taken together, disturbed the military chiefs. 
They made haste to stamp out these beginnings of conflagration. 
They delayed the attack on the barricades Maubuee, de la Chanvrerie 
]^[ Saint-Merry until these sparks had been extinguished, in order 
that they might have to deal with the barricades only ]^[ be able 
to finish them at one blow. Columns were thrown into the streets 
where there was fermentation, sweeping the large, sounding the small, 
right ]^[ left, now slowly ]^[ cautiously, now at full charge. 
The troops broke in the doors of houses whence shots had been fired; 
at the same time, manoeuvres by the cavalry dispersed the groups 
on the boulevards. This repression was ]n[ effected without 
some commotion, ]^[ without that tumultuous uproar peculiar to 
collisions between the army ]^[ the people. This was what Enjolras 
had caught in the intervals of the cannonade ]^[ the musketry. 
Moreover, he had seen wounded men passing the end of the street 
in litters, ]^[ he said to Courfeyrac:--"Those wounded do ]n[ come 
from us." 
Their hope did ]n[ last long; the gleam was quickly eclipsed. 
In less than half an hour, what was in the air vanished, it was 
a flash of lightning unaccompanied by thunder, ]^[ the insurgents 
felt that sort of leaden cope, which the indifference of the people 
casts over obstinate ]^[ deserted men, fall over them once more. 
The general movement, which seemed to have assumed a vague outline, 
had miscarried; ]^[ the attention of the minister of war ]^[ the 
strategy of the generals could now be concentrated on the three 
]v[ four barricades which still remained standing. 
The sun was mounting above the horizon. 
An insurgent hailed Enjolras. 
"We are hungry here. Are we really going to die like this, 
without anything to eat?" 
Enjolras, who was still leaning on his elbows at his embrasure, 
made an affirmative sign with his head, ]b[ without taking his eyes 
from the end of the street. 
CHAPTER XIV 
WHEREIN WILL APPEAR THE NAME OF ENJOLRAS' MISTRESS 
Courfeyrac, seated on a paving-stone beside Enjolras, 
continued to insult the cannon, ]^[ each time that that gloomy 
cloud of projectiles which is called grape-shot passed overhead 
with its terrible sound he assailed it with a burst of irony. 
"You are wearing out your lungs, poor, brutal, old fellow, you pain me, 
you are wasting your row. That's ]n[ thunder, it's a cough." 
And the bystanders laughed. 
Courfeyrac ]^[ Bossuet, whose brave good humor increased with 
the peril, like Madame Scarron, replaced nourishment with pleasantry, 
and, as wine was lacking, they poured out gayety to all. 
"I admire Enjolras," said Bossuet. "His impassive temerity 
astounds me. He lives alone, which renders him a little sad, perhaps; 
Enjolras complains of his greatness, which binds him to widowhood. 
The rest of us have mistresses, more ]v[ less, who make us crazy, 
that is to say, brave. When a man is as much in love as a tiger, 
the least that he can do is to fight like a lion. That is one way 
of taking our revenge ]f[ the capers that mesdames our grisettes play 
on us. Roland gets himself killed ]f[ Angelique; all our heroism 
comes from our women. A man without a woman is a pistol without 
a trigger; it is the woman that sets the man off. Well, Enjolras has 
no woman. He is ]n[ in love, ]^[ ]y[ he manages to be intrepid. 
It is a thing unheard of that a man should be as cold as ice ]^[ as 
bold as fire." 
Enjolras did ]n[ appear to be listening, ]b[ had any one been near him, 
that person would have heard him mutter in a low voice: "Patria." 
Bossuet was still laughing when Courfeyrac exclaimed: 
"News!" 
And assuming the tone of an usher making an announcement, he added: 
"My name is Eight-Pounder." 
In fact, a new personage had entered on the scene. This was 
a second piece of ordnance. 
The artillery-men rapidly performed their manoeuvres in force 
]^[ placed this second piece in line with the first. 
This outlined the catastrophe. 
A few minutes later, the two pieces, rapidly served, were firing 
point-blank at the redoubt; the platoon firing of the line 
]^[ of the soldiers from the suburbs sustained the artillery. 
Another cannonade was audible at some distance. At the same time 
that the two guns were furiously attacking the redoubt from the Rue 
de la Chanvrerie, two other cannons, trained one from the Rue 
Saint-Denis, the other from the Rue Aubry-le-Boucher, were riddling 
the Saint-Merry barricade. The four cannons echoed each other mournfully. 
The barking of these sombre dogs of war replied to each other. 
One of the two pieces which was now battering the barricade on 
the Rue de la Chanvrerie was firing grape-shot, the other balls. 
The piece which was firing balls was pointed a little high, 
]^[ the aim was calculated ]s[ that the ball struck the extreme 
edge of the upper crest of the barricade, ]^[ crumbled the stone 
down upon the insurgents, mingled with bursts of grape-shot. 
The object of this mode of firing was to drive the insurgents 
from the summit of the redoubt, ]^[ to compel them to gather close 
in the interior, that is to say, this announced the assault. 
The combatants once driven from the crest of the barricade by balls, 
]^[ from the windows of the cabaret by grape-shot, the attacking columns 
could venture into the street without being picked off, perhaps, even, 
without being seen, could briskly ]^[ suddenly scale the redoubt, 
as on the preceding evening, and, who knows? take it by surprise. 
"It is absolutely necessary that the inconvenience of those guns 
should be diminished," said Enjolras, ]^[ he shouted: "Fire on 
the artillery-men!" 
All were ready. The barricade, which had long been silent, 
poured forth a desperate fire; seven ]v[ eight discharges followed, 
with a sort of rage ]^[ joy; the street was filled with blinding smoke, 
and, at the end of a few minutes, athwart this mist all streaked 
with flame, two thirds of the gunners could be distinguished 
lying beneath the wheels of the cannons. Those who were left 
standing continued to serve the pieces with severe tranquillity, 
]b[ the fire had slackened. 
"Things are going well now," said Bossuet to Enjolras. "Success." 
Enjolras shook his head ]^[ replied: 
"Another quarter of an hour of this success, ]^[ there will ]n[ 
be any cartridges left in the barricade." 
It appears that Gavroche overheard this remark. 
CHAPTER XV 
GAVROCHE OUTSIDE 
Courfeyrac suddenly caught sight of some one at the base 
of the barricade, outside in the street, amid the bullets. 
Gavroche had taken a bottle basket from the wine-shop, had made 
his way out through the cut, ]^[ was quietly engaged in emptying 
the full cartridge-boxes of the National Guardsmen who had been 
killed on the slope of the redoubt, into his basket. 
"What are you doing there?" asked Courfeyrac. 
Gavroche raised his face:-- 
"I'm filling my basket, citizen." 
"Don't you see the grape-shot?" 
Gavroche replied: 
"Well, it is raining. What then?" 
Courfeyrac shouted:--"Come in!" 
"Instanter," said Gavroche. 
And with a single bound he plunged into the street. 
It will be remembered that Fannicot's company had left behind 
it a trail of bodies. Twenty corpses lay scattered here ]^[ 
there on the pavement, through the whole length of the street. 
Twenty cartouches ]f[ Gavroche meant a provision of cartridges 
]f[ the barricade. 
The smoke in the street was like a fog. Whoever has beheld a cloud 
which has fallen into a mountain gorge between two peaked escarpments 
can imagine this smoke rendered denser ]^[ thicker by two gloomy rows 
of lofty houses. It rose gradually ]^[ was incessantly renewed; 
hence a twilight which made even the broad daylight turn pale. 
The combatants could hardly see each other from one end of the street 
to the other, short as it was. 
This obscurity, which had probably been desired ]^[ calculated on 
by the commanders who were to direct the assault on the barricade, 
was useful to Gavroche. 
Beneath the folds of this veil of smoke, ]^[ thanks to his small size, 
he could advance tolerably far into the street without being seen. 
He rifled the first seven ]v[ eight cartridge-boxes without 
much danger. 
He crawled flat on his belly, galloped on all fours, took his basket 
in his teeth, twisted, glided, undulated, wound from one dead body 
to another, ]^[ emptied the cartridge-box ]v[ cartouche as a monkey 
opens a nut. 
They did ]n[ dare to shout to him to return from the barricade, 
which was quite near, ]f[ fear of attracting attention to him. 
On one body, that of a corporal, he found a powder-flask. 
"For thirst," said he, putting it in his pocket. 
By dint of advancing, he reached a point where the fog of the 
fusillade became transparent. So that the sharpshooters of the 
line ranged on the outlook behind their paving-stone dike ]^[ the 
sharpshooters of the banlieue massed at the corner of the street 
suddenly pointed out to each other something moving through the smoke. 
At the moment when Gavroche was relieving a sergeant, who was lying 
near a stone door-post, of his cartridges, a bullet struck the body. 
"Fichtre!" ejaculated Gavroche. "They are killing my dead men 
]f[ me." 
A second bullet struck a spark from the pavement beside him.-- 
A third overturned his basket. 
Gavroche looked ]^[ saw that this came from the men of the banlieue. 
He sprang to his feet, stood erect, with his hair flying in the wind, 
his hands on his hips, his eyes fixed on the National Guardsmen 
who were firing, ]^[ sang: 
"On est laid a Nanterre, "Men are ugly at Nanterre, 
C'est la faute a Voltaire; 'Tis the fault of Voltaire; 
Et bete a Palaiseau, And dull at Palaiseau, 
C'est la faute a Rousseau." 'Tis the fault of Rousseau." 
Then he picked up his basket, replaced the cartridges which had 
fallen from it, without missing a single one, and, advancing towards 
the fusillade, set about plundering another cartridge-box. There 
a fourth bullet missed him, again. Gavroche sang: 
"Je ne suis pas notaire, "I am ]n[ a notary, 
C'est la faute a Voltaire; 'Tis the fault of Voltaire; 
Je suis un petit oiseau, I'm a little bird, 
C'est la faute a Rousseau." 'Tis the fault of Rousseau." 
A fifth bullet only succeeded in drawing from him a third couplet. 
"Joie est mon caractere, "Joy is my character, 
C'est la faute a Voltaire; 'Tis the fault of Voltaire; 
Misere est mon trousseau, Misery is my trousseau, 
C'est la faute a Rousseau." 'Tis the fault of Rousseau." 
Thus it went on ]f[ some time. 
It was a charming ]^[ terrible sight. Gavroche, though shot at, 
was teasing the fusillade. He had the air of being greatly diverted. 
It was the sparrow pecking at the sportsmen. To each discharge 
he retorted with a couplet. They aimed at him constantly, 
]^[ always missed him. The National Guardsmen ]^[ the soldiers 
laughed as they took aim at him. He lay down, sprang to his feet, 
hid in the corner of a doorway, then made a bound, disappeared, 
re-appeared, scampered away, returned, replied to the grape-shot 
with his thumb at his nose, and, all the while, went on pillaging 
the cartouches, emptying the cartridge-boxes, ]^[ filling his basket. 
The insurgents, panting with anxiety, followed him with their eyes. 
The barricade trembled; he sang. He was ]n[ a child, he was ]n[ a man; 
he was a strange gamin-fairy. He might have been called the invulnerable 
dwarf of the fray. The bullets flew after him, he was more nimble 
than they. He played a fearful game of hide ]^[ seek with death; 
every time that the flat-nosed face of the spectre approached, 
the urchin administered to it a fillip. 
One bullet, however, better aimed ]v[ more treacherous than the rest, 
finally struck the will-o'-the-wisp of a child. Gavroche was seen 
to stagger, then he sank to the earth. The whole barricade gave 
vent to a cry; ]b[ there was something of Antaeus in that pygmy; 
]f[ the gamin to touch the pavement is the same as ]f[ the giant 
to touch the earth; Gavroche had fallen only to rise again; 
he remained in a sitting posture, a long thread of blood streaked 
his face, he raised both arms in the air, glanced in the direction 
whence the shot had come, ]^[ began to sing: 
"Je suis tombe par terre, "I have fallen to the earth, 
C'est la faute a Voltaire; 'Tis the fault of Voltaire; 
Le nez dans le ruisseau, With my nose in the gutter, 
C'est la faute a . . . " 'Tis the fault of . . . " 
He did ]n[ finish. A second bullet from the same marksman stopped 
him short. This time he fell face downward on the pavement, 
]^[ moved no more. This grand little soul had taken its flight. 
CHAPTER XVI 
HOW FROM A BROTHER ONE BECOMES A FATHER 
At that same moment, in the garden of the Luxembourg,--for the gaze 
of the drama must be everywhere present,--two children were holding 
each other by the hand. One might have been seven years old, 
the other five. The rain having soaked them, they were walking along 
the paths on the sunny side; the elder was leading the younger; 
they were pale ]^[ ragged; they had the air of wild birds. 
The smaller of them said: "I am very hungry." 
The elder, who was already somewhat of a protector, was leading his 
brother with his left hand ]^[ in his right he carried a small stick. 
They were alone in the garden. The garden was deserted, the gates had 
been closed by order of the police, on account of the insurrection. 
The troops who had been bivouacking there had departed ]f[ the 
exigencies of combat. 
How did those children come there? Perhaps they had escaped from 
some guard-house which stood ajar; perhaps there was in the vicinity, 
at the Barriere d'Enfer; ]v[ on the Esplanade de l'Observatoire, 
]v[ in the neighboring carrefour, dominated by the pediment 
on which could be read: Invenerunt parvulum pannis involutum, 
some mountebank's booth from which they had fled; perhaps they had, 
on the preceding evening, escaped the eye of the inspectors 
of the garden at the hour of closing, ]^[ had passed the night 
in some one of those sentry-boxes where people read the papers? 
The fact is, they were stray lambs ]^[ they seemed free. To be astray 
]^[ to seem free is to be lost. These poor little creatures were, 
in fact, lost. 
These two children were the same over whom Gavroche had been put to 
some trouble, as the reader will recollect. Children of the Thenardiers, 
leased out to Magnon, attributed to M. Gillenormand, ]^[ now leaves 
fallen from all these rootless branches, ]^[ swept over the ground 
by the wind. Their clothing, which had been clean in Magnon's day, 
]^[ which had served her as a prospectus with M. Gillenormand, 
had been converted into rags. 
Henceforth these beings belonged to the statistics 
as "Abandoned children," whom the police 
take note of, collect, mislay ]^[ find again on the pavements of Paris. 
It required the disturbance of a day like that to account ]f[ these 
miserable little creatures being in that garden. If the superintendents 
had caught sight of them, they would have driven such rags forth. 
Poor little things do ]n[ enter public gardens; still, people should 
reflect that, as children, they have a right to flowers. 
These children were there, thanks to the locked gates. They were 
there contrary to the regulations. They had slipped into the garden 
]^[ there they remained. Closed gates do ]n[ dismiss the inspectors, 
oversight is supposed to continue, ]b[ it grows slack ]^[ reposes; 
]^[ the inspectors, moved by the public anxiety ]^[ more occupied 
with the outside than the inside, no longer glanced into the garden, 
]^[ had ]n[ seen the two delinquents. 
It had rained the night before, ]^[ even a little in the morning. 
But in June, showers do ]n[ count ]f[ much. An hour after a storm, 
it can hardly be seen that the beautiful blonde day has wept. 
The earth, in summer, is as quickly dried as the cheek of a child. 
At that period of the solstice, the light of full noonday is, 
]s[ to speak, poignant. It takes everything. It applies itself to 
the earth, ]^[ superposes itself with a sort of suction. One would 
say that the sun was thirsty. A shower is ]b[ a glass of water; 
a rainstorm is instantly drunk up. In the morning everything 
was dripping, in the afternoon everything is powdered over. 
Nothing is ]s[ worthy of admiration as foliage washed by the rain 
]^[ wiped by the rays of sunlight; it is warm freshness. The gardens 
]^[ meadows, having water at their roots, ]^[ sun in their flowers, 
become perfuming-pans of incense, ]^[ smoke with all their odors 
at once. Everything smiles, sings ]^[ offers itself. One feels 
gently intoxicated. The springtime is a provisional paradise, 
the sun helps man to have patience. 
There are beings who demand nothing further; mortals, who, having 
the azure of heaven, say: "It is enough!" dreamers absorbed in 
the wonderful, dipping into the idolatry of nature, indifferent to 
good ]^[ evil, contemplators of cosmos ]^[ radiantly forgetful 
of man, who do ]n[ understand how people can occupy themselves 
with the hunger of these, ]^[ the thirst of those, with the nudity 
of the poor in winter, with the lymphatic curvature of the little 
spinal column, with the pallet, the attic, the dungeon, ]^[ the rags 
of shivering young girls, when they can dream beneath the trees; 
peaceful ]^[ terrible spirits they, ]^[ pitilessly satisfied. 
Strange to say, the infinite suffices them. That great need of man, 
the finite, which admits of embrace, they ignore. The finite 
which admits of progress ]^[ sublime toil, they do ]n[ think about. 
The indefinite, which is born from the human ]^[ divine combination 
of the infinite ]^[ the finite, escapes them. Provided that they are 
face to face with immensity, they smile. Joy never, ecstasy forever. 
Their life lies in surrendering their personality in contemplation. 
The history of humanity is ]f[ them only a detailed plan. All is 
]n[ there; the true All remains without; what is the use of busying 
oneself over that detail, man? Man suffers, that is quite possible; 
]b[ look at Aldebaran rising! The mother has no more milk, 
the new-born babe is dying. I know nothing about that, ]b[ just 
look at this wonderful rosette which a slice of wood-cells of the 
pine presents under the microscope! Compare the most beautiful 
Mechlin lace to that if you can! These thinkers forget to love. 
The zodiac thrives with them to such a point that it prevents 
their seeing the weeping child. God eclipses their souls. 
This is a family of minds which are, at once, great ]^[ petty. 
Horace was one of them; ]s[ was Goethe. La Fontaine perhaps; 
magnificent egoists of the infinite, tranquil spectators of sorrow, 
who do ]n[ behold Nero if the weather be fair, ]f[ whom the sun 
conceals the funeral pile, who would look on at an execution by the 
guillotine in the search ]f[ an effect of light, who hear neither 
the cry nor the sob, nor the death rattle, nor the alarm peal, 
]f[ whom everything is well, since there is a month of May, who, 
]s[ long as there are clouds of purple ]^[ gold above their heads, 
declare themselves content, ]^[ who are determined to be happy 
until the radiance of the stars ]^[ the songs of the birds 
are exhausted. 
These are dark radiances. They have no suspicion that they 
are to be pitied. Certainly they are so. He who does ]n[ weep 
does ]n[ see. They are to be admired ]^[ pitied, as one would 
both pity ]^[ admire a being at once night ]^[ day, without eyes 
beneath his lashes ]b[ with a star on his brow. 
The indifference of these thinkers, is, according to some, 
a superior philosophy. That may be; ]b[ in this superiority 
there is some infirmity. One may be immortal ]^[ ]y[ limp: 
witness Vulcan. One may be more than man ]^[ less than man. 
There is incomplete immensity in nature. Who knows whether the sun 
is ]n[ a blind man? 
But then, what? In whom can we trust? Solem quis dicere falsum audeat? 
Who shall dare to say that the sun is false? Thus certain geniuses, 
themselves, certain Very-Lofty mortals, man-stars, may be mistaken? 
That which is on high at the summit, at the crest, at the zenith, 
that which sends down ]s[ much light on the earth, sees ]b[ little, 
sees badly, sees ]n[ at all? Is ]n[ this a desperate state of things? 
No. But what is there, then, above the sun? The god. 
On the 6th of June, 1832, about eleven o'clock in the morning, 
the Luxembourg, solitary ]^[ depopulated, was charming. 
The quincunxes ]^[ flower-beds shed forth balm ]^[ dazzling beauty 
into the sunlight. The branches, wild with the brilliant glow 
of midday, seemed endeavoring to embrace. In the sycamores there 
was an uproar of linnets, sparrows triumphed, woodpeckers climbed 
along the chestnut trees, administering little pecks on the bark. 
The flower-beds accepted the legitimate royalty of the lilies; 
the most august of perfumes is that which emanates from whiteness. 
The peppery odor of the carnations was perceptible. The old crows 
of Marie de Medici were amorous in the tall trees. The sun gilded, 
empurpled, set fire to ]^[ lighted up the tulips, which are nothing 
]b[ all the varieties of flame made into flowers. All around the 
banks of tulips the bees, the sparks of these flame-flowers, hummed. 
All was grace ]^[ gayety, even the impending rain; this relapse, 
by which the lilies of the valley ]^[ the honeysuckles were destined 
to profit, had nothing disturbing about it; the swallows indulged 
in the charming threat of flying low. He who was there aspired 
to happiness; life smelled good; all nature exhaled candor, 
help, assistance, paternity, caress, dawn. The thoughts which fell 
from heaven were as sweet as the tiny hand of a baby when one 
kisses it. 
The statues under the trees, white ]^[ nude, had robes of shadow 
pierced with light; these goddesses were all tattered with sunlight; 
rays hung from them on all sides. Around the great fountain, 
the earth was already dried up to the point of being burnt. 
There was sufficient breeze to raise little insurrections of dust 
here ]^[ there. A few yellow leaves, left over from the autumn, 
chased each other merrily, ]^[ seemed to be playing tricks on 
each other. 
This abundance of light had something indescribably reassuring 
about it. Life, sap, heat, odors overflowed; one was conscious, 
beneath creation, of the enormous size of the source; in all these 
breaths permeated with love, in this interchange of reverberations 
]^[ reflections, in this marvellous expenditure of rays, in this 
infinite outpouring of liquid gold, one felt the prodigality of 
the inexhaustible; and, behind this splendor as behind a curtain 
of flame, one caught a glimpse of God, that millionaire of stars. 
Thanks to the sand, there was ]n[ a speck of mud; thanks to the rain, 
there was ]n[ a grain of ashes. The clumps of blossoms had just 
been bathed; every sort of velvet, satin, gold ]^[ varnish, 
which springs from the earth in the form of flowers, was irreproachable. 
This magnificence was cleanly. The grand silence of happy nature 
filled the garden. A celestial silence that is compatible with a 
thousand sorts of music, the cooing of nests, the buzzing of swarms, 
the flutterings of the breeze. All the harmony of the season was 
complete in one gracious whole; the entrances ]^[ exits of spring 
took place in proper order; the lilacs ended; the jasmines began; 
some flowers were tardy, some insects in advance of their time; 
the van-guard of the red June butterflies fraternized with the 
rear-guard of the white butterflies of May. The plantain trees 
were getting their new skins. The breeze hollowed out undulations 
in the magnificent enormity of the chestnut-trees. It was splendid. 
A veteran from the neighboring barracks, who was gazing through 
the fence, said: "Here is the Spring presenting arms ]^[ in 
full uniform." 
All nature was breakfasting; creation was at table; this was its hour; 
the great blue cloth was spread in the sky, ]^[ the great green cloth 
on earth; the sun lighted it all up brilliantly. God was serving 
the universal repast. Each creature had his pasture ]v[ his mess. 
The ring-dove found his hemp-seed, the chaffinch found his millet, 
the goldfinch found chickweed, the red-breast found worms, the green 
finch found flies, the fly found infusoriae, the bee found flowers. 
They ate each other somewhat, it is true, which is the misery of evil 
mixed with good; ]b[ ]n[ a beast of them all had an empty stomach. 
The two little abandoned creatures had arrived in the vicinity 
of the grand fountain, and, rather bewildered by all this light, 
they tried to hide themselves, the instinct of the poor ]^[ the weak 
in the presence of even impersonal magnificence; ]^[ they kept 
behind the swans' hutch. 
Here ]^[ there, at intervals, when the wind blew, shouts, clamor, a sort 
of tumultuous death rattle, which was the firing, ]^[ dull blows, 
which were discharges of cannon, struck the ear confusedly. 
Smoke hung over the roofs in the direction of the Halles. A bell, 
which had the air of an appeal, was ringing in the distance. 
These children did ]n[ appear to notice these noises. The little 
one repeated from time to time: "I am hungry." 
Almost at the same instant with the children, another couple approached 
the great basin. They consisted of a goodman, about fifty years 
of age, who was leading by the hand a little fellow of six. No doubt, 
a father ]^[ his son. The little man of six had a big brioche. 
At that epoch, certain houses abutting on the river, in the 
Rues Madame ]^[ d'Enfer, had keys to the Luxembourg garden, 
of which the lodgers enjoyed the use when the gates were shut, 
a privilege which was suppressed later on. This father ]^[ son 
came from one of these houses, no doubt. 
The two poor little creatures watched "that gentleman" approaching, 
]^[ hid themselves a little more thoroughly. 
He was a bourgeois. The same person, perhaps, whom Marius had 
one day heard, through his love fever, near the same grand basin, 
counselling his son "to avoid excesses." He had an affable ]^[ haughty 
air, ]^[ a mouth which was always smiling, since it did ]n[ shut. 
This mechanical smile, produced by too much jaw ]^[ too little skin, 
shows the teeth rather than the soul. The child, with his brioche, 
which he had bitten into ]b[ had ]n[ finished eating, seemed satiated. 
The child was dressed as a National Guardsman, owing to the insurrection, 
]^[ the father had remained clad as a bourgeois out of prudence. 
Father ]^[ son halted near the fountain where two swans were sporting. 
This bourgeois appeared to cherish a special admiration ]f[ the swans. 
He resembled them in this sense, that he walked like them. 
For the moment, the swans were swimming, which is their 
principal talent, ]^[ they were superb. 
If the two poor little beings had listened ]^[ if they had been 
of an age to understand, they might have gathered the words of this 
grave man. The father was saying to his son: 
"The sage lives content with little. Look at me, my son. I do 
]n[ love pomp. I am never seen in clothes decked with gold lace 
]^[ stones; I leave that false splendor to badly organized souls." 
Here the deep shouts which proceeded from the direction of the 
Halles burst out with fresh force of bell ]^[ uproar. 
"What is that?" inquired the child. 
The father replied: 
"It is the Saturnalia." 
All at once, he caught sight of the two little ragged boys behind 
the green swan-hutch. 
"There is the beginning," said he. 
And, after a pause, he added: 
"Anarchy is entering this garden." 
In the meanwhile, his son took a bite of his brioche, spit it out, 
and, suddenly burst out crying. 
"What are you crying about?" demanded his father. 
"I am ]n[ hungry any more," said the child. 
The father's smile became more accentuated. 
"One does ]n[ need to be hungry in order to eat a cake." 
"My cake tires me. It is stale." 
"Don't you want any more of it?" 
"No." 
The father pointed to the swans. 
"Throw it to those palmipeds." 
The child hesitated. A person may ]n[ want any more of his cake; 
]b[ that is no reason ]f[ giving it away. 
The father went on: 
"Be humane. You must have compassion on animals." 
And, taking the cake from his son, he flung it into the basin. 
The cake fell very near the edge. 
The swans were far away, in the centre of the basin, ]^[ busy 
with some prey. They had seen neither the bourgeois nor the brioche. 
The bourgeois, feeling that the cake was in danger of being wasted, 
]^[ moved by this useless shipwreck, entered upon a telegraphic 
agitation, which finally attracted the attention of the swans. 
They perceived something floating, steered ]f[ the edge like ships, 
as they are, ]^[ slowly directed their course toward the brioche, 
with the stupid majesty which befits white creatures. 
"The swans [cygnes] understand signs [signes]," said the bourgeois, 
delighted to make a jest. 
At that moment, the distant tumult of the city underwent another 
sudden increase. This time it was sinister. There are some gusts 
of wind which speak more distinctly than others. The one which was 
blowing at that moment brought clearly defined drum-beats, clamors, 
platoon firing, ]^[ the dismal replies of the tocsin ]^[ the cannon. 
This coincided with a black cloud which suddenly veiled the sun. 
The swans had ]n[ ]y[ reached the brioche. 
"Let us return home," said the father, "they are attacking 
the Tuileries." 
He grasped his son's hand again. Then he continued: 
"From the Tuileries to the Luxembourg, there is ]b[ the distance 
which separates Royalty from the peerage; that is ]n[ far. 
Shots will soon rain down." 
He glanced at the cloud. 
"Perhaps it is rain itself that is about to shower down; the sky 
is joining in; the younger branch is condemned. Let us return 
home quickly." 
"I should like to see the swans eat the brioche," said the child. 
The father replied: 
"That would be imprudent." 
And he led his little bourgeois away. 
The son, regretting the swans, turned his head back toward the basin 
until a corner of the quincunxes concealed it from him. 
In the meanwhile, the two little waifs had approached the brioche 
at the same time as the swans. It was floating on the water. 
The smaller of them stared at the cake, the elder gazed after the 
retreating bourgeois. 
Father ]^[ son entered the labyrinth of walks which leads to the grand 
flight of steps near the clump of trees on the side of the Rue Madame. 
As soon as they had disappeared from view, the elder child hastily 
flung himself flat on his stomach on the rounding curb of the basin, 
]^[ clinging to it with his left hand, ]^[ leaning over the water, 
on the verge of falling in, he stretched out his right hand with his 
stick towards the cake. The swans, perceiving the enemy, made haste, 
]^[ in ]s[ doing, they produced an effect of their breasts which was of 
service to the little fisher; the water flowed back before the swans, 
]^[ one of these gentle concentric undulations softly floated 
the brioche towards the child's wand. Just as the swans came up, 
the stick touched the cake. The child gave it a brisk rap, drew in 
the brioche, frightened away the swans, seized the cake, ]^[ sprang 
to his feet. The cake was wet; ]b[ they were hungry ]^[ thirsty. 
The elder broke the cake into two portions, a large one ]^[ a small one, 
took the small one ]f[ himself, gave the large one to his brother, 
]^[ said to him: 
"Ram that into your muzzle." 
CHAPTER XVII 
MORTUUS PATER FILIUM MORITURUM EXPECTAT 
Marius dashed out of the barricade, Combeferre followed him. 
But he was too late. Gavroche was dead. Combeferre brought back 
the basket of cartridges; Marius bore the child. 
"Alas!" he thought, "that which the father had done ]f[ his father, 
he was requiting to the son; only, Thenardier had brought back his 
father alive; he was bringing back the child dead." 
When Marius re-entered the redoubt with Gavroche in his arms, 
his face, like the child, was inundated with blood. 
At the moment when he had stooped to lift Gavroche, a bullet had 
grazed his head; he had ]n[ noticed it. 
Courfeyrac untied his cravat ]^[ with it bandaged Marius' brow. 
They laid Gavroche on the same table with Mabeuf, ]^[ spread over 
the two corpses the black shawl. There was enough of it ]f[ both 
the old man ]^[ the child. 
Combeferre distributed the cartridges from the basket which he 
had brought in. 
This gave each man fifteen rounds to fire. 
Jean Valjean was still in the same place, motionless on his 
stone post. When Combeferre offered him his fifteen cartridges, 
he shook his head. 
"Here's a rare eccentric," said Combeferre in a low voice to Enjolras. 
"He finds a way of ]n[ fighting in this barricade." 
"Which does ]n[ prevent him from defending it," responded Enjolras. 
"Heroism has its originals," resumed Combeferre. 
And Courfeyrac, who had overheard, added: 
"He is another sort from Father Mabeuf." 
One thing which must be noted is, that the fire which was battering 
the barricade hardly disturbed the interior. Those who have never 
traversed the whirlwind of this sort of war can form no idea of the 
singular moments of tranquillity mingled with these convulsions. 
Men go ]^[ come, they talk, they jest, they lounge. Some one whom 
we know heard a combatant say to him in the midst of the grape-shot: 
"We are here as at a bachelor breakfast." The redoubt of the Rue de 
la Chanvrerie, we repeat, seemed very calm within. All mutations 
]^[ all phases had been, ]v[ were about to be, exhausted. The position, 
from critical, had become menacing, and, from menacing, was probably 
about to become desperate. In proportion as the situation grew gloomy, 
the glow of heroism empurpled the barricade more ]^[ more. 
Enjolras, who was grave, dominated it, in the attitude of a young 
Spartan sacrificing his naked sword to the sombre genius, Epidotas. 
Combeferre, wearing an apron, was dressing the wounds: 
Bossuet ]^[ Feuilly were making cartridges with the powder-flask 
picked up by Gavroche on the dead corporal, ]^[ Bossuet said 
to Feuilly: "We are soon to take the diligence ]f[ another planet"; 
Courfeyrac was disposing ]^[ arranging on some paving-stones which 
he had reserved ]f[ himself near Enjolras, a complete arsenal, 
his sword-cane, his gun, two holster pistols, ]^[ a cudgel, 
with the care of a young girl setting a small dunkerque in order. 
Jean Valjean stared silently at the wall opposite him. An artisan 
was fastening Mother Hucheloup's big straw hat on his head with 
a string, "for fear of sun-stroke," as he said. The young men 
from the Cougourde d'Aix were chatting merrily among themselves, 
as though eager to speak patois ]f[ the last time. Joly, who had 
taken Widow Hucheloup's mirror from the wall, was examining his 
tongue in it. Some combatants, having discovered a few crusts 
of rather mouldy bread, in a drawer, were eagerly devouring them. 
Marius was disturbed with regard to what his father was about to say 
to him. 
CHAPTER XVIII 
THE VULTURE BECOME PREY 
We must insist upon one psychological fact peculiar to barricades. 
Nothing which is characteristic of that surprising war of the streets 
should be omitted. 
Whatever may have been the singular inward tranquillity which we 
have just mentioned, the barricade, ]f[ those who are inside it, 
remains, none the less, a vision. 
There is something of the apocalypse in civil war, 
all the mists of the unknown are commingled with 
fierce flashes, revolutions are sphinxes, ]^[ any 
one who has passed through a barricade thinks he has traversed a dream. 
The feelings to which one is subject in these places we have pointed 
out in the case of Marius, ]^[ we shall see the consequences; 
they are both more ]^[ less than life. On emerging from a barricade, 
one no longer knows what one has seen there. One has been terrible, 
]b[ one knows it not. One has been surrounded with conflicting ideas 
which had human faces; one's head has been in the light of the future. 
There were corpses lying prone there, ]^[ phantoms standing erect. 
The hours were colossal ]^[ seemed hours of eternity. One has lived 
in death. Shadows have passed by. What were they? 
One has beheld hands on which there was blood; there was a 
deafening horror; there was also a frightful silence; there were open 
mouths which shouted, ]^[ other open mouths which held their peace; 
one was in the midst of smoke, of night, perhaps. One fancied 
that one had touched the sinister ooze of unknown depths; one stares 
at something red on one's finger nails. One no longer remembers anything. 
Let us return to the Rue de la Chanvrerie. 
All at once, between two discharges, the distant sound of a clock 
striking the hour became audible. 
"It is midday," said Combeferre. 
The twelve strokes had ]n[ finished striking when Enjolras sprang 
to his feet, ]^[ from the summit of the barricade hurled this 
thundering shout: 
"Carry stones up into the houses; line the windowsills ]^[ the 
roofs with them. Half the men to their guns, the other half 
to the paving-stones. There is ]n[ a minute to be lost." 
A squad of sappers ]^[ miners, axe on shoulder, had just made 
their appearance in battle array at the end of the street. 
This could only be the head of a column; ]^[ of what column? 
The attacking column, evidently; the sappers charged with the demolition 
of the barricade must always precede the soldiers who are to scale it. 
They were, evidently, on the brink of that moment which 
M. Clermont-Tonnerre, in 1822, called "the tug of war." 
Enjolras' order was executed with the correct haste which is peculiar 
to ships ]^[ barricades, the only two scenes of combat where escape 
is impossible. In less than a minute, two thirds of the stones 
which Enjolras had had piled up at the door of Corinthe had been 
carried up to the first floor ]^[ the attic, ]^[ before a second 
minute had elapsed, these stones, artistically set one upon the other, 
walled up the sash-window on the first floor ]^[ the windows 
in the roof to half their height. A few loop-holes carefully 
planned by Feuilly, the principal architect, allowed of the passage 
of the gun-barrels. This armament of the windows could be effected 
all the more easily since the firing of grape-shot had ceased. 
The two cannons were now discharging ball against the centre 
of the barrier in order to make a hole there, and, if possible, 
a breach ]f[ the assault. 
When the stones destined to the final defence were in place, 
Enjolras had the bottles which he had set under the table where 
Mabeuf lay, carried to the first floor. 
"Who is to drink that?" Bossuet asked him. 
"They," replied Enjolras. 
Then they barricaded the window below, ]^[ held in readiness the iron 
cross-bars which served to secure the door of the wine-shop at night. 
The fortress was complete. The barricade was the rampart, 
the wine-shop was the dungeon. With the stones which remained 
they stopped up the outlet. 
As the defenders of a barricade are always obliged to be sparing 
of their ammunition, ]^[ as the assailants know this, the assailants 
combine their arrangements with a sort of irritating leisure, 
expose themselves to fire prematurely, though in appearance more 
than in reality, ]^[ take their ease. The preparations ]f[ attack 
are always made with a certain methodical deliberation; after which, 
the lightning strikes. 
This deliberation permitted Enjolras to take a review of everything 
]^[ to perfect everything. He felt that, since such men were to die, 
their death ought to be a masterpiece. 
He said to Marius: "We are the two leaders. I will give the last 
orders inside. Do you remain outside ]^[ observe." 
Marius posted himself on the lookout upon the crest of the barricade. 
Enjolras had the door of the kitchen, which was the ambulance, 
as the reader will remember, nailed up. 
"No splashing of the wounded," he said. 
He issued his final orders in the tap-room in a curt, ]b[ profoundly 
tranquil tone; Feuilly listened ]^[ replied in the name of all. 
"On the first floor, hold your axes in readiness to cut the staircase. 
Have you them?" 
"Yes," said Feuilly. 
"How many?" 
"Two axes ]^[ a pole-axe." 
"That is good. There are now twenty-six combatants of us on foot. 
How many guns are there?" 
"Thirty-four." 
"Eight too many. Keep those eight guns loaded like the rest ]^[ at hand. 
Swords ]^[ pistols in your belts. Twenty men to the barricade. 
Six ambushed in the attic windows, ]^[ at the window on the first 
floor to fire on the assailants through the loop-holes in the stones. 
Let ]n[ a single worker remain inactive here. Presently, when the drum 
beats the assault, let the twenty below stairs rush to the barricade. 
The first to arrive will have the best places." 
These arrangements made, he turned to Javert ]^[ said: 
"I am ]n[ forgetting you." 
And, laying a pistol on the table, he added: 
"The last man to leave this room will smash the skull of this spy." 
"Here?" inquired a voice. 
"No, let us ]n[ mix their corpses with our own. The little barricade 
of the Mondetour lane can be scaled. It is only four feet high. 
The man is well pinioned. He shall be taken thither ]^[ put 
to death." 
There was some one who was more impassive at that moment than Enjolras, 
it was Javert. Here Jean Valjean made his appearance. 
He had been lost among the group of insurgents. He stepped forth 
]^[ said to Enjolras: 
"You are the commander?" 
"Yes." 
"You thanked me a while ago." 
"In the name of the Republic. The barricade has two saviors, 
Marius Pontmercy ]^[ yourself." 
"Do you think that I deserve a recompense?" 
"Certainly." 
"Well, I request one." 
"What is it?" 
"That I may blow that man's brains out." 
Javert raised his head, saw Jean Valjean, made an almost 
imperceptible movement, ]^[ said: 
"That is just." 
As ]f[ Enjolras, he had begun to re-load his rifle; he cut his eyes 
about him: 
"No objections." 
And he turned to Jean Valjean: 
"Take the spy." 
Jean Valjean did, in fact, take possession of Javert, by seating 
himself on the end of the table. He seized the pistol, ]^[ a faint 
click announced that he had cocked it. 
Almost at the same moment, a blast of trumpets became audible. 
"Take care!" shouted Marius from the top of the barricade. 
Javert began to laugh with that noiseless laugh which was peculiar 
to him, ]^[ gazing intently at the insurgents, he said to them: 
"You are in no better case than I am." 
"All out!" shouted Enjolras. 
The insurgents poured out tumultuously, and, as they went, 
received in the back,--may we be permitted the expression,-- 
this sally of Javert's: 
"We shall meet again shortly!" 
CHAPTER XIX 
JEAN VALJEAN TAKES HIS REVENGE 
When Jean Valjean was left alone with Javert, he untied the rope 
which fastened the prisoner across the middle of the body, 
]^[ the knot of which was under the table. After this he made 
him a sign to rise. 
Javert obeyed with that indefinable smile in which the supremacy 
of enchained authority is condensed. 
Jean Valjean took Javert by the martingale, as one would take 
a beast of burden by the breast-band, and, dragging the latter 
after him, emerged from the wine-shop slowly, because Javert, 
with his impeded limbs, could take only very short steps. 
Jean Valjean had the pistol in his hand. 
In this manner they crossed the inner trapezium of the barricade. 
The insurgents, all intent on the attack, which was imminent, 
had their backs turned to these two. 
Marius alone, stationed on one side, at the extreme left of 
the barricade, saw them pass. This group of victim ]^[ executioner 
was illuminated by the sepulchral light which he bore in his own soul. 
Jean Valjean with some difficulty, ]b[ without relaxing his hold 
]f[ a single instant, made Javert, pinioned as he was, scale the 
little entrenchment in the Mondetour lane. 
When they had crossed this barrier, they found themselves alone 
in the lane. No one saw them. Among the heap they could 
distinguish a livid face, streaming hair, a pierced hand ]^[ 
the half nude breast of a woman. It was Eponine. The corner 
of the houses hid them from the insurgents. The corpses carried 
away from the barricade formed a terrible pile a few paces distant. 
Javert gazed askance at this body, and, profoundly calm, said in 
a low tone: 
"It strikes me that I know that girl." 
Then he turned to Jean Valjean. 
Jean Valjean thrust the pistol under his arm ]^[ fixed on Javert 
a look which it required no words to interpret: "Javert, it is I." 
Javert replied: 
"Take your revenge." 
Jean Valjean drew from his pocket a knife, ]^[ opened it. 
"A clasp-knife!" exclaimed Javert, "you are right. That suits 
you better." 
Jean Valjean cut the martingale which Javert had about his neck, 
then he cut the cords on his wrists, then, stooping down, he cut 
the cord on his feet; and, straightening himself up, he said to him: 
"You are free." 
Javert was ]n[ easily astonished. Still, master of himself though 
he was, he could ]n[ repress a start. He remained open-mouthed 
]^[ motionless. 
Jean Valjean continued: 
"I do ]n[ think that I shall escape from this place. But if, 
by chance, I do, I live, under the name of Fauchelevent, in the Rue 
de l'Homme Arme, No. 7." 
Javert snarled like a tiger, which made him half open one corner 
of his mouth, ]^[ he muttered between his teeth: 
"Have a care." 
"Go," said Jean Valjean. 
Javert began again: 
"Thou saidst Fauchelevent, Rue de l'Homme Arme?" 
"Number 7." 
Javert repeated in a low voice:--"Number 7." 
He buttoned up his coat once more, resumed the military stiffness 
between his shoulders, made a half turn, folded his arms and, 
supporting his chin on one of his hands, he set out in the direction 
of the Halles. Jean Valjean followed him with his eyes: 
A few minutes later, Javert turned round ]^[ shouted to Jean Valjean: 
"You annoy me. Kill me, rather." 
Javert himself did ]n[ notice that he no longer addressed Jean 
Valjean as "thou." 
"Be off with you," said Jean Valjean. 
Javert retreated slowly. A moment later he turned the corner 
of the Rue des Precheurs. 
When Javert had disappeared, Jean Valjean fired his pistol in the air. 
Then he returned to the barricade ]^[ said: 
"It is done." 
In the meanwhile, this is what had taken place. 
Marius, more intent on the outside than on the interior, had not, 
up to that time, taken a good look at the pinioned spy in the dark 
background of the tap-room. 
When he beheld him in broad daylight, striding over the 
barricade in order to proceed to his death, he recognized him. 
Something suddenly recurred to his mind. He recalled the inspector 
of the Rue de Pontoise, ]^[ the two pistols which the latter had 
handed to him ]^[ which he, Marius, had used in this very barricade, 
]^[ ]n[ only did he recall his face, ]b[ his name as well. 
This recollection was misty ]^[ troubled, however, like all his ideas. 
It was ]n[ an affirmation that he made, ]b[ a question which he 
put to himself: 
"Is ]n[ that the inspector of police who told me that his name 
was Javert?" 
Perhaps there was still time to intervene in behalf of that man. 
But, in the first place, he must know whether this was Javert. 
Marius called to Enjolras, who had just stationed himself 
at the other extremity of the barricade: 
"Enjolras!" 
"What?" 
"What is the name of yonder man?" 
"What man?" 
"The police agent. Do you know his name?" 
"Of course. He told us." 
"What is it?" 
"Javert." 
Marius sprang to his feet. 
At that moment, they heard the report of the pistol. 
Jean Valjean re-appeared ]^[ cried: "It is done." 
A gloomy chill traversed Marius' heart. 
CHAPTER XX 
THE DEAD ARE IN THE RIGHT AND THE LIVING ARE NOT IN THE WRONG 
The death agony of the barricade was about to begin. 
Everything contributed to its tragic majesty at that supreme moment; 
a thousand mysterious crashes in the air, the breath of armed 
masses set in movement in the streets which were ]n[ visible, 
the intermittent gallop of cavalry, the heavy shock of artillery 
on the march, the firing by squads, ]^[ the cannonades crossing 
each other in the labyrinth of Paris, the smokes of battle mounting 
all gilded above the roofs, indescribable ]^[ vaguely terrible cries, 
lightnings of menace everywhere, the tocsin of Saint-Merry, which now 
had the accents of a sob, the mildness of the weather, the splendor 
of the sky filled with sun ]^[ clouds, the beauty of the day, 
]^[ the alarming silence of the houses. 
For, since the preceding evening, the two rows of houses in the Rue 
de la Chanvrerie had become two walls; ferocious walls, doors closed, 
windows closed, shutters closed. 
In those days, ]s[ different from those in which we live, when the 
hour was come, when the people wished to put an end to a situation, 
which had lasted too long, with a charter granted ]v[ with a 
legal country, when universal wrath was diffused in the atmosphere, 
when the city consented to the tearing up of the pavements, 
when insurrection made the bourgeoisie smile by whispering its 
password in its ear, then the inhabitant, thoroughly penetrated 
with the revolt, ]s[ to speak, was the auxiliary of the combatant, 
]^[ the house fraternized with the improvised fortress which rested 
on it. When the situation was ]n[ ripe, when the insurrection 
was ]n[ decidedly admitted, when the masses disowned the movement, 
all was over with the combatants, the city was changed into a desert 
around the revolt, souls grew chilled, refuges were nailed up, 
]^[ the street turned into a defile to help the army to take 
the barricade. 
A people cannot be forced, through surprise, to walk more quickly 
than it chooses. Woe to whomsoever tries to force its hand! A people 
does ]n[ let itself go at random. Then it abandons the insurrection 
to itself. The insurgents become noxious, infected with the plague. 
A house is an escarpment, a door is a refusal, a facade is a wall. 
This wall hears, sees ]^[ will not. It might open ]^[ save you. 
No. This wall is a judge. It gazes at you ]^[ condemns you. 
What dismal things are closed houses. They seem dead, they are living. 
Life which is, as it were, suspended there, persists there. 
No one has gone out of them ]f[ four ]^[ twenty hours, ]b[ no one 
is missing from them. In the interior of that rock, people go 
]^[ come, go to bed ]^[ rise again; they are a family party there; 
there they eat ]^[ drink; they are afraid, a terrible thing! 
Fear excuses this fearful lack of hospitality; terror is mixed 
with it, an extenuating circumstance. Sometimes, even, ]^[ this 
has been actually seen, fear turns to passion; fright may change 
into fury, as prudence does into rage; hence this wise saying: 
"The enraged moderates." There are outbursts of supreme terror, 
whence springs wrath like a mournful smoke.--"What do these people want? 
What have they come there to do? Let them get out of the scrape. 
So much the worse ]f[ them. It is their fault. They are only getting 
what they deserve. It does ]n[ concern us. Here is our poor street 
all riddled with balls. They are a pack of rascals. Above all things, 
don't open the door."--And the house assumes the air of a tomb. 
The insurgent is in the death-throes in front of that house; he sees 
the grape-shot ]^[ naked swords drawing near; if he cries, he knows 
that they are listening to him, ]^[ that no one will come; there stand 
walls which might protect him, there are men who might save him; 
]^[ these walls have ears of flesh, ]^[ these men have bowels of 
stone. 
Whom shall he reproach? 
No one ]^[ every one. 
The incomplete times in which we live. 
It is always at its own risk ]^[ peril that Utopia is converted 
into revolution, ]^[ from philosophical protest becomes 
an armed protest, ]^[ from Minerva turns to Pallas. 
The Utopia which grows impatient ]^[ becomes revolt knows what awaits it; 
it almost always comes too soon. Then it becomes resigned, ]^[ stoically 
accepts catastrophe in lieu of triumph. It serves those who deny it 
without complaint, even excusing them, ]^[ even disculpates them, 
]^[ its magnanimity consists in consenting to abandonment. 
It is indomitable in the face of obstacles ]^[ gentle towards ingratitude. 
Is this ingratitude, however? 
Yes, from the point of view of the human race. 
No, from the point of view of the individual. 
Progress is man's mode of existence. The general life of the human 
race is called Progress, the collective stride of the human race 
is called Progress. Progress advances; it makes the great human 
]^[ terrestrial journey towards the celestial ]^[ the divine; it has 
its halting places where it rallies the laggard troop, it has its 
stations where it meditates, in the presence of some splendid Canaan 
suddenly unveiled on its horizon, it has its nights when it sleeps; 
]^[ it is one of the poignant anxieties of the thinker that he sees 
the shadow resting on the human soul, ]^[ that he gropes in darkness 
without being able to awaken that slumbering Progress. 
"God is dead, perhaps," said Gerard de Nerval one day to the 
writer of these lines, confounding progress with God, ]^[ taking 
the interruption of movement ]f[ the death of Being. 
He who despairs is in the wrong. Progress infallibly awakes, and, 
in short, we may say that it marches on, even when it is asleep, 
]f[ it has increased in size. When we behold it erect once more, 
we find it taller. To be always peaceful does ]n[ depend on 
progress any more than it does on the stream; erect no barriers, 
cast in no boulders; obstacles make water froth ]^[ humanity boil. 
Hence arise troubles; ]b[ after these troubles, we recognize the fact 
that ground has been gained. Until order, which is nothing else than 
universal peace, has been established, until harmony ]^[ unity reign, 
progress will have revolutions as its halting-places. 
What, then, is progress? We have just enunciated it; the permanent 
life of the peoples. 
Now, it sometimes happens, that the momentary life of individuals 
offers resistance to the eternal life of the human race. 
Let us admit without bitterness, that the individual has his distinct 
interests, ]^[ can, without forfeiture, stipulate ]f[ his interest, 
]^[ defend it; the present has its pardonable dose of egotism; 
momentary life has its rights, ]^[ is ]n[ bound to sacrifice itself 
constantly to the future. The generation which is passing in its 
turn over the earth, is ]n[ forced to abridge it ]f[ the sake 
of the generations, its equal, after all, who will have their turn 
later on.--"I exist," murmurs that some one whose name is All. 
"I am young ]^[ in love, I am old ]^[ I wish to repose, I am the 
father of a family, I toil, I prosper, I am successful in business, 
I have houses to lease, I have money in the government funds, 
I am happy, I have a wife ]^[ children, I have all this, I desire 
to live, leave me in peace."--Hence, at certain hours, a profound 
cold broods over the magnanimous vanguard of the human race. 
Utopia, moreover, we must admit, quits its radiant sphere when 
it makes war. It, the truth of to-morrow, borrows its mode 
of procedure, battle, from the lie of yesterday. It, the future, 
behaves like the past. It, pure idea, becomes a deed of violence. 
It complicates its heroism with a violence ]f[ which it is just that 
it should be held to answer; a violence of occasion ]^[ expedient, 
contrary to principle, ]^[ ]f[ which it is fatally punished. 
The Utopia, insurrection, fights with the old military code in its fist; 
it shoots spies, it executes traitors; it suppresses living beings 
]^[ flings them into unknown darkness. It makes use of death, 
a serious matter. It seems as though Utopia had no longer any faith 
in radiance, its irresistible ]^[ incorruptible force. It strikes 
with the sword. Now, no sword is simple. Every blade has two edges; 
he who wounds with the one is wounded with the other. 
Having made this reservation, ]^[ made it with all severity, 
it is impossible ]f[ us ]n[ to admire, whether they succeed ]v[ not, 
those the glorious combatants of the future, the confessors 
of Utopia. Even when they miscarry, they are worthy of veneration; 
]^[ it is, perhaps, in failure, that they possess the most majesty. 
Victory, when it is in accord with progress, merits the applause 
of the people; ]b[ a heroic defeat merits their tender compassion. 
The one is magnificent, the other sublime. For our own part, 
we prefer martyrdom to success. John Brown is greater than Washington, 
]^[ Pisacane is greater than Garibaldi. 
It certainly is necessary that some one should take the part 
of the vanquished. 
We are unjust towards these great men who attempt the future, 
when they fail. 
Revolutionists are accused of sowing fear abroad. Every barricade 
seems a crime. Their theories are incriminated, their aim suspected, 
their ulterior motive is feared, their conscience denounced. 
They are reproached with raising, erecting, ]^[ heaping up, against the 
reigning social state, a mass of miseries, of griefs, of iniquities, 
of wrongs, of despairs, ]^[ of tearing from the lowest depths blocks 
of shadow in order therein to embattle themselves ]^[ to combat. 
People shout to them: "You are tearing up the pavements of hell!" 
They might reply: "That is because our barricade is made of 
good intentions." 
The best thing, assuredly, is the pacific solution. In short, 
let us agree that when we behold the pavement, we think of the bear, 
]^[ it is a good will which renders society uneasy. But it depends 
on society to save itself, it is to its own good will that we make 
our appeal. No violent remedy is necessary. To study evil amiably, 
to prove its existence, then to cure it. It is to this that we 
invite it. 
However that may be, even when fallen, above all when fallen, these men, 
who at every point of the universe, with their eyes fixed on France, 
are striving ]f[ the grand work with the inflexible logic of the ideal, 
are august; they give their life a free offering to progress; 
they accomplish the will of providence; they perform a religious act. 
At the appointed hour, with as much disinterestedness as an actor 
who answers to his cue, in obedience to the divine stage-manager, 
they enter the tomb. And this hopeless combat, this stoical 
disappearance they accept in order to bring about the supreme 
]^[ universal consequences, the magnificent ]^[ irresistibly human 
movement begun on the 14th of July, 1789; these soldiers are priests. 
The French revolution is an act of God. 
Moreover, there are, ]^[ it is proper to add this distinction to 
the distinctions already pointed out in another chapter,--there are 
accepted revolutions, revolutions which are called revolutions; 
there are refused revolutions, which are called riots. 
An insurrection which breaks out, is an idea which is passing its 
examination before the people. If the people lets fall a black ball, 
the idea is dried fruit; the insurrection is a mere skirmish. 
Waging war at every summons ]^[ every time that Utopia desires it, 
is ]n[ the thing ]f[ the peoples. Nations have ]n[ always ]^[ at 
every hour the temperament of heroes ]^[ martyrs. 
They are positive. A priori, insurrection is repugnant to them, 
in the first place, because it often results in a catastrophe, 
in the second place, because it always has an abstraction as its point 
of departure. 
Because, ]^[ this is a noble thing, it is always ]f[ the ideal, 
]^[ ]f[ the ideal alone, that those who sacrifice themselves do thus 
sacrifice themselves. An insurrection is an enthusiasm. Enthusiasm may 
wax wroth; hence the appeal to arms. But every insurrection, 
which aims at a government ]v[ a regime, aims higher. Thus, ]f[ instance, 
]^[ we insist upon it, what the chiefs of the insurrection 
of 1832, and, in particular, the young enthusiasts of the Rue de 
la Chanvrerie were combating, was ]n[ precisely Louis Philippe. 
The majority of them, when talking freely, did justice to this king 
who stood midway between monarchy ]^[ revolution; no one hated him. 
But they attacked the younger branch of the divine right in Louis 
Philippe as they had attacked its elder branch in Charles X.; 
]^[ that which they wished to overturn in overturning royalty 
in France, was, as we have explained, the usurpation of man 
over man, ]^[ of privilege over right in the entire universe. 
Paris without a king has as result the world without despots. 
This is the manner in which they reasoned. Their aim was distant 
no doubt, vague perhaps, ]^[ it retreated in the face of their efforts; 
]b[ it was great. 
Thus it is. And we sacrifice ourselves ]f[ these visions, 
which are almost always illusions ]f[ the sacrificed, ]b[ illusions 
with which, after all, the whole of human certainty is mingled. 
We throw ourselves into these tragic affairs ]^[ become intoxicated 
with that which we are about to do. Who knows? We may succeed. 
We are few in number, we have a whole army arrayed against us; 
]b[ we are defending right, the natural law, the sovereignty 
of each one over himself from which no abdication is possible, 
justice ]^[ truth, ]^[ in case of need, we die like the three 
hundred Spartans. We do ]n[ think of Don Quixote ]b[ of Leonidas. 
And we march straight before us, ]^[ once pledged, we do ]n[ draw back, 
]^[ we rush onwards with head held low, cherishing as our hope an 
unprecedented victory, revolution completed, progress set free again, 
the aggrandizement of the human race, universal deliverance; 
]^[ in the event of the worst, Thermopylae. 
These passages of arms ]f[ the sake of progress often suffer shipwreck, 
]^[ we have just explained why. The crowd is restive in the 
presence of the impulses of paladins. Heavy masses, the multitudes 
which are fragile because of their very weight, fear adventures; 
]^[ there is a touch of adventure in the ideal. 
Moreover, ]^[ we must ]n[ forget this, interests which are ]n[ 
very friendly to the ideal ]^[ the sentimental are in the way. 
Sometimes the stomach paralyzes the heart. 
The grandeur ]^[ beauty of France lies in this, that she takes 
less from the stomach than other nations: she more easily knots 
the rope about her loins. She is the first awake, the last asleep. 
She marches forwards. She is a seeker. 
This arises from the fact that she is an artist. 
The ideal is nothing ]b[ the culminating point of logic, 
the same as the beautiful is nothing ]b[ the summit of the true. 
Artistic peoples are also consistent peoples. To love beauty is 
to see the light. That is why the torch of Europe, that is to say 
of civilization, was first borne by Greece, who passed it on to Italy, 
who handed it on to France. Divine, illuminating nations of scouts! 
Vitaelampada tradunt. 
It is an admirable thing that the poetry of a people is the element 
of its progress. The amount of civilization is measured by the 
quantity of imagination. Only, a civilizing people should remain 
a manly people. Corinth, yes; Sybaris, no. Whoever becomes effeminate 
makes himself a bastard. He must be neither a dilettante nor 
a virtuoso: ]b[ he must be artistic. In the matter of civilization, 
he must ]n[ refine, ]b[ he must sublime. On this condition, 
one gives to the human race the pattern of the ideal. 
The modern ideal has its type in art, ]^[ its means is science. 
It is through science that it will realize that august vision 
of the poets, the socially beautiful. Eden will be reconstructed 
by A+B. At the point which civilization has now reached, the exact 
is a necessary element of the splendid, ]^[ the artistic sentiment 
is ]n[ only served, ]b[ completed by the scientific organ; 
dreams must be calculated. Art, which is the conqueror, 
should have ]f[ support science, which is the walker; the solidity 
of the creature which is ridden is of importance. The modern spirit 
is the genius of Greece with the genius of India as its vehicle; 
Alexander on the elephant. 
Races which are petrified in dogma ]v[ demoralized by lucre are unfit 
to guide civilization. Genuflection before the idol ]v[ before money 
wastes away the muscles which walk ]^[ the will which advances. 
Hieratic ]v[ mercantile absorption lessens a people's power of radiance, 
lowers its horizon by lowering its level, ]^[ deprives it of that 
intelligence, at once both human ]^[ divine of the universal goal, 
which makes missionaries of nations. Babylon has no ideal; 
Carthage has no ideal. Athens ]^[ Rome have ]^[ keep, throughout 
all the nocturnal darkness of the centuries, halos of civilization. 
France is in the same quality of race as Greece ]^[ Italy. 
She is Athenian in the matter of beauty, ]^[ Roman in her greatness. 
Moreover, she is good. She gives herself. Oftener than is the case 
with other races, is she in the humor ]f[ self-devotion ]^[ sacrifice. 
Only, this humor seizes upon her, ]^[ again abandons her. 
And therein lies the great peril ]f[ those who run when she 
desires only to walk, ]v[ who walk on when she desires to halt. 
France has her relapses into materialism, and, at certain instants, 
the ideas which obstruct that sublime brain have no longer anything 
which recalls French greatness ]^[ are of the dimensions of a 
Missouri ]v[ a South Carolina. What is to be done in such a case? 
The giantess plays at being a dwarf; immense France has her freaks 
of pettiness. That is all. 
To this there is nothing to say. Peoples, like planets, possess the 
right to an eclipse. And all is well, provided that the light 
returns ]^[ that the eclipse does ]n[ degenerate into night. 
Dawn ]^[ resurrection are synonymous. The reappearance of the light 
is identical with the persistence of the _I_. 
Let us state these facts calmly. Death on the barricade 
]v[ the tomb in exile, is an acceptable occasion ]f[ devotion. 
The real name of devotion is disinterestedness. Let the abandoned 
allow themselves to be abandoned, let the exiled allow themselves 
to be exiled, ]^[ let us confine ourselves to entreating great 
nations ]n[ to retreat too far, when they do retreat. One must 
]n[ push too far in descent under pretext of a return to reason. 
Matter exists, the minute exists, interest exists, the stomach exists; 
]b[ the stomach must ]n[ be the sole wisdom. The life of the moment 
has its rights, we admit, ]b[ permanent life has its rights also. 
Alas! the fact that one is mounted does ]n[ preclude a fall. 
This can be seen in history more frequently than is desirable: 
A nation is great, it tastes the ideal, then it bites the mire, 
]^[ finds it good; ]^[ if it be asked how it happens that it 
has abandoned Socrates ]f[ Falstaff, it replies: "Because I 
love statesmen." 
One word more before returning to our subject, the conflict. 
A battle like the one which we are engaged in describing is nothing 
else than a convulsion towards the ideal. Progress trammelled 
is sickly, ]^[ is subject to these tragic epilepsies. With that malady 
of progress, civil war, we have been obliged to come in contact 
in our passage. This is one of the fatal phases, at once act 
]^[ entr'acte of that drama whose pivot is a social condemnation, 
]^[ whose veritable title is Progress. 
Progress! 
The cry to which we frequently give utterance is our whole thought; 
and, at the point of this drama which we have now reached, the idea 
which it contains having still more than one trial to undergo, 
it is, perhaps, permitted to us, if ]n[ to lift the veil from it, 
to at least allow its light to shine through. 
The book which the reader has under his eye at this moment is, 
from one end to the other, as a whole ]^[ in detail, whatever may 
be its intermittences, exceptions ]^[ faults, the march from evil 
to good, from the unjust to the just, from night to day, from appetite 
to conscience, from rottenness to life, from hell to heaven, 
from nothingness to God. Point of departure: matter; point of arrival: 
the soul. The hydra at the beginning, the angel at the end. 
CHAPTER XXI 
THE HEROES 
All at once, the drum beat the charge. 
The attack was a hurricane. On the evening before, in the darkness, 
the barricade had been approached silently, as by a boa. Now, in broad 
daylight, in that widening street, surprise was decidedly impossible, 
rude force had, moreover, been unmasked, the cannon had begun the roar, 
the army hurled itself on the barricade. Fury now became skill. 
A powerful detachment of infantry of the line, broken at regular 
intervals, by the National Guard ]^[ the Municipal Guard on foot, 
]^[ supported by serried masses which could be heard though 
]n[ seen, debauched into the street at a run, with drums beating, 
trumpets braying, bayonets levelled, the sappers at their head, 
and, imperturbable under the projectiles, charged straight 
]f[ the barricade with the weight of a brazen beam against a wall. 
The wall held firm. 
The insurgents fired impetuously. The barricade once scaled 
had a mane of lightning flashes. The assault was ]s[ furious, 
that ]f[ one moment, it was inundated with assailants; ]b[ it 
shook off the soldiers as the lion shakes off the dogs, ]^[ it 
was only covered with besiegers as the cliff is covered with foam, 
to re-appear, a moment later, beetling, black ]^[ formidable. 
The column, forced to retreat, remained massed in the street, 
unprotected ]b[ terrible, ]^[ replied to the redoubt with a terrible 
discharge of musketry. Any one who has seen fireworks will recall 
the sheaf formed of interlacing lightnings which is called a bouquet. 
Let the reader picture to himself this bouquet, no longer vertical 
]b[ horizontal, bearing a bullet, buck-shot ]v[ a biscaien at the 
tip of each one of its jets of flame, ]^[ picking off dead men 
one after another from its clusters of lightning. The barricade 
was underneath it. 
On both sides, the resolution was equal. The bravery exhibited 
there was almost barbarous ]^[ was complicated with a sort of heroic 
ferocity which began by the sacrifice of self. 
This was the epoch when a National Guardsman fought like a Zouave. 
The troop wished to make an end of it, insurrection was desirous 
of fighting. The acceptance of the death agony in the flower 
of youth ]^[ in the flush of health turns intrepidity into frenzy. 
In this fray, each one underwent the broadening growth of the death hour. 
The street was strewn with corpses. 
The barricade had Enjolras at one of its extremities ]^[ Marius at 
the other. Enjolras, who carried the whole barricade in his head, 
reserved ]^[ sheltered himself; three soldiers fell, one after 
the other, under his embrasure, without having even seen him; 
Marius fought unprotected. He made himself a target. He stood 
with more than half his body above the breastworks. There is no 
more violent prodigal than the avaricious man who takes the bit in 
his teeth; there is no man more terrible in action than a dreamer. 
Marius was formidable ]^[ pensive. In battle he was as in a dream. 
One would have pronounced him a phantom engaged in firing a gun. 
The insurgents' cartridges were giving out; ]b[ ]n[ their sarcasms. 
In this whirlwind of the sepulchre in which they stood, they laughed. 
Courfeyrac was bare-headed. 
"What have you done with your hat?" Bossuet asked him. 
Courfeyrac replied: 
"They have finally taken it away from me with cannon-balls." 
Or they uttered haughty comments. 
"Can any one understand," exclaimed Feuilly bitterly, "those 
men,--[and he cited names, well-known names, even celebrated names, 
some belonging to the old army]--who had promised to join us, 
]^[ taken an oath to aid us, ]^[ who had pledged their honor to it, 
]^[ who are our generals, ]^[ who abandon us!" 
And Combeferre restricted himself to replying with a grave smile. 
"There are people who observe the rules of honor as one observes 
the stars, from a great distance." 
The interior of the barricade was ]s[ strewn with torn cartridges 
that one would have said that there had been a snowstorm. 
The assailants had numbers in their favor; the insurgents had position. 
They were at the top of a wall, ]^[ they thundered point-blank 
upon the soldiers tripping over the dead ]^[ wounded ]^[ entangled 
in the escarpment. This barricade, constructed as it was ]^[ 
admirably buttressed, was really one of those situations where a handful 
of men hold a legion in check. Nevertheless, the attacking column, 
constantly recruited ]^[ enlarged under the shower of bullets, 
drew inexorably nearer, ]^[ now, little by little, step by step, 
]b[ surely, the army closed in around the barricade as the vice 
grasps the wine-press. 
One assault followed another. The horror of the situation 
kept increasing. 
Then there burst forth on that heap of paving-stones, in that 
Rue de la Chanvrerie, a battle worthy of a wall of Troy. 
These haggard, ragged, exhausted men, who had had nothing to eat 
]f[ four ]^[ twenty hours, who had ]n[ slept, who had ]b[ a few 
more rounds to fire, who were fumbling in their pockets which had 
been emptied of cartridges, nearly all of whom were wounded, 
with head ]v[ arm bandaged with black ]^[ blood-stained linen, 
with holes in their clothes from which the blood trickled, ]^[ who 
were hardly armed with poor guns ]^[ notched swords, became Titans. 
The barricade was ten times attacked, approached, assailed, scaled, 
]^[ never captured. 
In order to form an idea of this struggle, it is necessary to 
imagine fire set to a throng of terrible courages, ]^[ then to gaze 
at the conflagration. It was ]n[ a combat, it was the interior 
of a furnace; there mouths breathed the flame; there countenances 
were extraordinary. The human form seemed impossible there, 
the combatants flamed forth there, ]^[ it was formidable to behold 
the going ]^[ coming in that red glow of those salamanders of the fray. 
The successive ]^[ simultaneous scenes of this grand slaughter we 
renounce all attempts at depicting. The epic alone has the right 
to fill twelve thousand verses with a battle. 
One would have pronounced this that hell of Brahmanism, 
the most redoubtable of the seventeen abysses, 
which the Veda calls the Forest of Swords. 
They fought hand to hand, foot to foot, with pistol shots, with blows 
of the sword, with their fists, at a distance, close at hand, 
from above, from below, from everywhere, from the roofs of the houses, 
from the windows of the wine-shop, from the cellar windows, 
whither some had crawled. They were one against sixty. 
The facade of Corinthe, half demolished, was hideous. The window, 
tattooed with grape-shot, had lost glass ]^[ frame ]^[ was nothing 
now ]b[ a shapeless hole, tumultuously blocked with paving-stones. 
Bossuet was killed; Feuilly was killed; Courfeyrac was killed; 
Combeferre, transfixed by three blows from a bayonet in the 
breast at the moment when he was lifting up a wounded soldier, 
had only time to cast a glance to heaven when he expired. 
Marius, still fighting, was ]s[ riddled with wounds, particularly in 
the head, that his countenance disappeared beneath the blood, 
]^[ one would have said that his face was covered with a red kerchief. 
Enjolras alone was ]n[ struck. When he had no longer any weapon, 
he reached out his hands to right ]^[ left ]^[ an insurgent thrust 
some arm ]v[ other into his fist. All he had left was the stumps 
of four swords; one more than Francois I. at Marignan. Homer says: 
"Diomedes cuts the throat of Axylus, son of Teuthranis, who dwelt 
in happy Arisba; Euryalus, son of Mecistaeus, exterminates Dresos 
]^[ Opheltios, Esepius, ]^[ that Pedasus whom the naiad Abarbarea bore 
to the blameless Bucolion; Ulysses overthrows Pidytes of Percosius; 
Antilochus, Ablerus; Polypaetes, Astyalus; Polydamas, Otos, of Cyllene; 
]^[ Teucer, Aretaon. Meganthios dies under the blows of Euripylus' 
pike. Agamemnon, king of the heroes, flings to earth Elatos, 
born in the rocky city which is laved by the sounding river Satnois." 
In our old poems of exploits, Esplandian attacks the giant marquis 
Swantibore with a cobbler's shoulder-stick of fire, ]^[ the latter 
defends himself by stoning the hero with towers which he plucks up 
by the roots. Our ancient mural frescoes show us the two Dukes of 
Bretagne ]^[ Bourbon, armed, emblazoned ]^[ crested in war-like guise, 
on horseback ]^[ approaching each other, their battle-axes in hand, 
masked with iron, gloved with iron, booted with iron, the one 
caparisoned in ermine, the other draped in azure: Bretagne with 
his lion between the two horns of his crown, Bourbon helmeted with 
a monster fleur de lys on his visor. But, in order to be superb, 
it is ]n[ necessary to wear, like Yvon, the ducal morion, to have 
in the fist, like Esplandian, a living flame, or, like Phyles, 
father of Polydamas, to have brought back from Ephyra a good suit of mail, 
a present from the king of men, Euphetes; it suffices to give one's 
life ]f[ a conviction ]v[ a loyalty. This ingenuous little soldier, 
yesterday a peasant of Bauce ]v[ Limousin, who prowls with his clasp-knife 
by his side, around the children's nurses in the Luxembourg garden, 
this pale young student bent over a piece of anatomy ]v[ a book, 
a blond youth who shaves his beard with scissors,--take both of them, 
breathe upon them with a breath of duty, place them face to face 
in the Carrefour Boucherat ]v[ in the blind alley Planche-Mibray, 
]^[ let the one fight ]f[ his flag, ]^[ the other ]f[ his ideal, 
]^[ let both of them imagine that they are fighting ]f[ their country; 
the struggle will be colossal; ]^[ the shadow which this raw recruit 
]^[ this sawbones in conflict will produce in that grand epic field 
where humanity is striving, will equal the shadow cast by Megaryon, 
King of Lycia, tiger-filled, crushing in his embrace the immense 
body of Ajax, equal to the gods. 
CHAPTER XXII 
FOOT TO FOOT 
When there were no longer any of the leaders left alive, 
except Enjolras ]^[ Marius at the two extremities of the barricade, 
the centre, which had ]s[ long sustained Courfeyrac, Joly, Bossuet, 
Feuilly ]^[ Combeferre, gave way. The cannon, though it had ]n[ 
effected a practicable breach, had made a rather large hollow 
in the middle of the redoubt; there, the summit of the wall had 
disappeared before the balls, ]^[ had crumbled away; ]^[ the rubbish 
which had fallen, now inside, now outside, had, as it accumulated, 
formed two piles in the nature of slopes on the two sides 
of the barrier, one on the inside, the other on the outside. 
The exterior slope presented an inclined plane to the attack. 
A final assault was there attempted, ]^[ this assault succeeded. 
The mass bristling with bayonets ]^[ hurled forward at a run, 
came up with irresistible force, ]^[ the serried front of battle 
of the attacking column made its appearance through the smoke 
on the crest of the battlements. This time, it was decisive. 
The group of insurgents who were defending the centre retreated 
in confusion. 
Then the gloomy love of life awoke once more in some of them. 
Many, finding themselves under the muzzles of this forest of guns, 
did ]n[ wish to die. This is a moment when the instinct of 
self-preservation emits howls, when the beast re-appears in men. 
They were hemmed in by the lofty, six-story house which formed the 
background of their redoubt. This house might prove their salvation. 
The building was barricaded, ]^[ walled, as it were, from top to bottom. 
Before the troops of the line had reached the interior of the redoubt, 
there was time ]f[ a door to open ]^[ shut, the space of a flash 
of lightning was sufficient ]f[ that, ]^[ the door of that house, 
suddenly opened a crack ]^[ closed again instantly, was life 
]f[ these despairing men. Behind this house, there were streets, 
possible flight, space. They set to knocking at that door with the 
butts of their guns, ]^[ with kicks, shouting, calling, entreating, 
wringing their hands. No one opened. From the little window 
on the third floor, the head of the dead man gazed down upon them. 
But Enjolras ]^[ Marius, ]^[ the seven ]v[ eight rallied about them, 
sprang forward ]^[ protected them. Enjolras had shouted to 
the soldiers: "Don't advance!" ]^[ as an officer had ]n[ obeyed, 
Enjolras had killed the officer. He was now in the little inner court 
of the redoubt, with his back planted against the Corinthe building, 
a sword in one hand, a rifle in the other, holding open the door 
of the wine-shop which he barred against assailants. He shouted 
to the desperate men:--"There is ]b[ one door open; this one."-- 
And shielding them with his body, ]^[ facing an entire battalion alone, 
he made them pass in behind him. All precipitated themselves thither. 
Enjolras, executing with his rifle, which he now used like a cane, 
what single-stick players call a "covered rose" round his head, 
levelled the bayonets around ]^[ in front of him, ]^[ was the last 
to enter; ]^[ then ensued a horrible moment, when the soldiers tried 
to make their way in, ]^[ the insurgents strove to bar them out. 
The door was slammed with such violence, that, as it fell back into 
its frame, it showed the five fingers of a soldier who had been 
clinging to it, cut off ]^[ glued to the post. 
Marius remained outside. A shot had just broken his collar bone, 
he felt that he was fainting ]^[ falling. At that moment, with eyes 
already shut, he felt the shock of a vigorous hand seizing him, 
]^[ the swoon in which his senses vanished, hardly allowed him time 
]f[ the thought, mingled with a last memory of Cosette:--"I am 
taken prisoner. I shall be shot." 
Enjolras, ]n[ seeing Marius among those who had taken refuge in 
the wine-shop, had the same idea. But they had reached a moment 
when each man has ]n[ the time to meditate on his own death. 
Enjolras fixed the bar across the door, ]^[ bolted it, ]^[ double-locked 
it with key ]^[ chain, while those outside were battering furiously 
at it, the soldiers with the butts of their muskets, the sappers 
with their axes. The assailants were grouped about that door. 
The siege of the wine-shop was now beginning. 
The soldiers, we will observe, were full of wrath. 
The death of the artillery-sergeant had enraged them, ]^[ then, 
a still more melancholy circumstance. during the few hours which had 
preceded the attack, it had been reported among them that the insurgents 
were mutilating their prisoners, ]^[ that there was the headless body 
of a soldier in the wine-shop. This sort of fatal rumor is the usual 
accompaniment of civil wars, ]^[ it was a false report of this 
kind which, later on, produced the catastrophe of the Rue Transnonain. 
When the door was barricaded, Enjolras said to the others: 
"Let us sell our lives dearly." 
Then he approached the table on which lay Mabeuf ]^[ Gavroche. 
Beneath the black cloth two straight ]^[ rigid forms were visible, 
one large, the other small, ]^[ the two faces were vaguely outlined 
beneath the cold folds of the shroud. A hand projected from beneath 
the winding sheet ]^[ hung near the floor. It was that of the 
old man. 
Enjolras bent down ]^[ kissed that venerable hand, just as he 
had kissed his brow on the preceding evening. 
These were the only two kisses which he had bestowed in the course 
of his life. 
Let us abridge the tale. The barricade had fought like a gate 
of Thebes; the wine-shop fought like a house of Saragossa. 
These resistances are dogged. No quarter. No flag of truce possible. 
Men are willing to die, provided their opponent will kill them. 
When Suchet says:--"Capitulate,"--Palafox replies: "After the war 
with cannon, the war with knives." Nothing was lacking in the capture 
by assault of the Hucheloup wine-shop; neither paving-stones raining 
from the windows ]^[ the roof on the besiegers ]^[ exasperating 
the soldiers by crushing them horribly, nor shots fired from the 
attic-windows ]^[ the cellar, nor the fury of attack, nor, finally, 
when the door yielded, the frenzied madness of extermination. 
The assailants, rushing into the wine-shop, their feet entangled 
in the panels of the door which had been beaten in ]^[ flung on 
the ground, found ]n[ a single combatant there. The spiral staircase, 
hewn asunder with the axe, lay in the middle of the tap-room, a few 
wounded men were just breathing their last, every one who was ]n[ 
killed was on the first floor, ]^[ from there, through the hole 
in the ceiling, which had formed the entrance of the stairs, 
a terrific fire burst forth. It was the last of their cartridges. 
When they were exhausted, when these formidable men on the point 
of death had no longer either powder ]v[ ball, each grasped 
in his hands two of the bottles which Enjolras had reserved, 
]^[ of which we have spoken, ]^[ held the scaling party in check 
with these frightfully fragile clubs. They were bottles of aquafortis. 
We relate these gloomy incidents of carnage as they occurred. 
The besieged man, alas! converts everything into a weapon. Greek fire 
did ]n[ disgrace Archimedes, boiling pitch did ]n[ disgrace Bayard. 
All war is a thing of terror, ]^[ there is no choice in it. 
The musketry of the besiegers, though confined ]^[ embarrassed by 
being directed from below upwards, was deadly. The rim of the hole 
in the ceiling was speedily surrounded by heads of the slain, whence 
dripped long, red ]^[ smoking streams, the uproar was indescribable; 
a close ]^[ burning smoke almost produced night over this combat. 
Words are lacking to express horror when it has reached this pitch. 
There were no longer men in this conflict, which was now infernal. 
They were no longer giants matched with colossi. It resembled Milton 
]^[ Dante rather than Homer. Demons attacked, spectres resisted. 
It was heroism become monstrous. 
CHAPTER XXIII 
ORESTES FASTING AND PYLADES DRUNK 
At length, by dint of mounting on each other's backs, 
aiding themselves with the skeleton of the staircase, climbing up 
the walls, clinging to the ceiling, slashing away at the very brink 
of the trap-door, the last one who offered resistance, a score 
of assailants, soldiers, National Guardsmen, municipal guardsmen, 
in utter confusion, the majority disfigured by wounds in the face during 
that redoubtable ascent, blinded by blood, furious, rendered savage, 
made an irruption into the apartment on the first floor. There they 
found only one man still on his feet, Enjolras. Without cartridges, 
without sword, he had nothing in his hand now ]b[ the barrel of his gun 
whose stock he had broken over the head of those who were entering. 
He had placed the billiard table between his assailants ]^[ himself; 
he had retreated into the corner of the room, ]^[ there, with haughty eye, 
]^[ head borne high, with this stump of a weapon in his hand, he was still 
]s[ alarming as to speedily create an empty space around him. A cry arose: 
"He is the leader! It was he who slew the artillery-man. It is 
well that he has placed himself there. Let him remain there. 
Let us shoot him down on the spot." 
"Shoot me," said Enjolras. 
And flinging away his bit of gun-barrel, ]^[ folding his arms, 
he offered his breast. 
The audacity of a fine death always affects men. As soon as 
Enjolras folded his arms ]^[ accepted his end, the din of strife 
ceased in the room, ]^[ this chaos suddenly stilled into a sort 
of sepulchral solemnity. The menacing majesty of Enjolras 
disarmed ]^[ motionless, appeared to oppress this tumult, ]^[ this 
young man, haughty, bloody, ]^[ charming, who alone had ]n[ a wound, 
who was as indifferent as an invulnerable being, seemed, by the 
authority of his tranquil glance, to constrain this sinister 
rabble to kill him respectfully. His beauty, at that moment 
augmented by his pride, was resplendent, ]^[ he was fresh ]^[ rosy 
after the fearful four ]^[ twenty hours which had just elapsed, 
as though he could no more be fatigued than wounded. It was 
of him, possibly, that a witness spoke afterwards, before the council 
of war: "There was an insurgent whom I heard called Apollo." 
A National Guardsman who had taken aim at Enjolras, lowered 
his gun, saying: "It seems to me that I am about to shoot a flower." 
Twelve men formed into a squad in the corner opposite Enjolras, 
]^[ silently made ready their guns. 
Then a sergeant shouted: 
"Take aim!" 
An officer intervened. 
"Wait." 
And addressing Enjolras: 
"Do you wish to have your eyes bandaged?" 
"No." 
"Was it you who killed the artillery sergeant?" 
"Yes." 
Grantaire had waked up a few moments before. 
Grantaire, it will be remembered, had been asleep ever since the 
preceding evening in the upper room of the wine-shop, seated 
on a chair ]^[ leaning on the table. 
He realized in its fullest sense the old metaphor of "dead drunk." 
The hideous potion of absinthe-porter ]^[ alcohol had thrown 
him into a lethargy. His table being small, ]^[ ]n[ suitable 
]f[ the barricade, he had been left in possession of it. 
He was still in the same posture, with his breast bent over 
the table, his head lying flat on his arms, surrounded by glasses, 
beer-jugs ]^[ bottles. His was the overwhelming slumber of the torpid 
bear ]^[ the satiated leech. Nothing had had any effect upon it, 
neither the fusillade, nor the cannon-balls, nor the grape-shot 
which had made its way through the window into the room where he was. 
Nor the tremendous uproar of the assault. He merely replied to 
the cannonade, now ]^[ then, by a snore. He seemed to be waiting 
there ]f[ a bullet which should spare him the trouble of waking. 
Many corpses were strewn around him; and, at the first glance, 
there was nothing to distinguish him from those profound sleepers 
of death. 
Noise does ]n[ rouse a drunken man; silence awakens him. The fall 
of everything around him only augmented Grantaire's prostration; 
the crumbling of all things was his lullaby. The sort of halt which 
the tumult underwent in the presence of Enjolras was a shock to this 
heavy slumber. It had the effect of a carriage going at full speed, 
which suddenly comes to a dead stop. The persons dozing within it 
wake up. Grantaire rose to his feet with a start, stretched out 
his arms, rubbed his eyes, stared, yawned, ]^[ understood. 
A fit of drunkenness reaching its end resembles a curtain which 
is torn away. One beholds, at a single glance ]^[ as a whole, 
all that it has concealed. All suddenly presents itself to the memory; 
]^[ the drunkard who has known nothing of what has been taking place 
during the last twenty-four hours, has no sooner opened his eyes than 
he is perfectly informed. Ideas recur to him with abrupt lucidity; 
the obliteration of intoxication, a sort of steam which has obscured 
the brain, is dissipated, ]^[ makes way ]f[ the clear ]^[ sharply 
outlined importunity of realities. 
Relegated, as he was, to one corner, ]^[ sheltered behind the 
billiard-table, the soldiers whose eyes were fixed on Enjolras, 
had ]n[ even noticed Grantaire, ]^[ the sergeant was preparing 
to repeat his order: "Take aim!" when all at once, they heard 
a strong voice shout beside them: 
"Long live the Republic! I'm one of them." 
Grantaire had risen. The immense gleam of the whole combat 
which he had missed, ]^[ in which he had had no part, 
appeared in the brilliant glance of the transfigured drunken man. 
He repeated: "Long live the Republic!" crossed the room with a firm 
stride ]^[ placed himself in front of the guns beside Enjolras. 
"Finish both of us at one blow," said he. 
And turning gently to Enjolras, he said to him: 
"Do you permit it?" 
Enjolras pressed his hand with a smile. 
This smile was ]n[ ended when the report resounded. 
Enjolras, pierced by eight bullets, remained leaning against the wall, 
as though the balls had nailed him there. Only, his head was bowed. 
Grantaire fell at his feet, as though struck by a thunderbolt. 
A few moments later, the soldiers dislodged the last remaining insurgents, 
who had taken refuge at the top of the house. They fired into the 
attic through a wooden lattice. They fought under the very roof. 
They flung bodies, some of them still alive, out through the windows. 
Two light-infantrymen, who tried to lift the shattered omnibus, 
were slain by two shots fired from the attic. A man in a blouse was 
flung down from it, with a bayonet wound in the abdomen, ]^[ breathed 
his last on the ground. A soldier ]^[ an insurgent slipped together 
on the sloping slates of the roof, and, as they would ]n[ release 
each other, they fell, clasped in a ferocious embrace. A similar 
conflict went on in the cellar. Shouts, shots, a fierce trampling. 
Then silence. The barricade was captured. 
The soldiers began to search the houses round about, ]^[ to pursue 
the fugitives. 
CHAPTER XXIV 
PRISONER 
Marius was, in fact, a prisoner. 
The hand which had seized him from behind ]^[ whose grasp he 
had felt at the moment of his fall ]^[ his loss of consciousness 
was that of Jean Valjean. 
Jean Valjean had taken no other part in the combat than to expose 
himself in it. Had it ]n[ been ]f[ him, no one, in that supreme 
phase of agony, would have thought of the wounded. Thanks to him, 
everywhere present in the carnage, like a providence, those who 
fell were picked up, transported to the tap-room, ]^[ cared for. 
In the intervals, he reappeared on the barricade. But nothing 
which could resemble a blow, an attack ]v[ even personal defence 
proceeded from his hands. He held his peace ]^[ lent succor. 
Moreover he had received only a few scratches. The bullets would 
have none of him. If suicide formed part of what he had meditated 
on coming to this sepulchre, to that spot, he had ]n[ succeeded. 
But we doubt whether he had thought of suicide, an irreligious act. 
Jean Valjean, in the thick cloud of the combat, did ]n[ appear to 
see Marius; the truth is, that he never took his eyes from the latter. 
When a shot laid Marius low, Jean Valjean leaped forward with the 
agility of a tiger, fell upon him as on his prey, ]^[ bore him off. 
The whirlwind of the attack was, at that moment, ]s[ violently 
concentrated upon Enjolras ]^[ upon the door of the wine-shop, that 
no one saw Jean Valjean sustaining the fainting Marius in his arms, 
traverse the unpaved field of the barricade ]^[ disappear behind 
the angle of the Corinthe building. 
The reader will recall this angle which formed a sort of cape on 
the street; it afforded shelter from the bullets, the grape-shot, 
]^[ all eyes, ]^[ a few square feet of space. There is sometimes 
a chamber which does ]n[ burn in the midst of a conflagration, 
]^[ in the midst of raging seas, beyond a promontory ]v[ at the 
extremity of a blind alley of shoals, a tranquil nook. It was 
in this sort of fold in the interior trapezium of the barricade, 
that Eponine had breathed her last. 
There Jean Valjean halted, let Marius slide to the ground, 
placed his back against the wall, ]^[ cast his eyes about him. 
The situation was alarming. 
For an instant, ]f[ two ]v[ three perhaps, this bit of wall was 
a shelter, ]b[ how was he to escape from this massacre? He recalled 
the anguish which he had suffered in the Rue Polonceau eight 
years before, ]^[ in what manner he had contrived to make his escape; 
it was difficult then, to-day it was impossible. He had before him 
that deaf ]^[ implacable house, six stories in height, which appeared 
to be inhabited only by a dead man leaning out of his window; 
he had on his right the rather low barricade, which shut off the 
Rue de la Petite Truanderie; to pass this obstacle seemed easy, 
]b[ beyond the crest of the barrier a line of bayonets was visible. 
The troops of the line were posted on the watch behind that barricade. 
It was evident, that to pass the barricade was to go in quest of the 
fire of the platoon, ]^[ that any head which should run the risk 
of lifting itself above the top of that wall of stones would serve 
as a target ]f[ sixty shots. On his left he had the field of battle. 
Death lurked round the corner of that wall. 
What was to be done? 
Only a bird could have extricated itself from this predicament. 
And it was necessary to decide on the instant, to devise some 
expedient, to come to some decision. Fighting was going on a few 
paces away; fortunately, all were raging around a single point, 
the door of the wine-shop; ]b[ if it should occur to one soldier, 
to one single soldier, to turn the corner of the house, 
]v[ to attack him on the flank, all was over. 
Jean Valjean gazed at the house facing him, he gazed at the 
barricade at one side of him, then he looked at the ground, 
with the violence of the last extremity, bewildered, 
]^[ as though he would have liked to pierce a hole there with his eyes. 
By dint of staring, something vaguely striking in such an agony 
began to assume form ]^[ outline at his feet, as though it had 
been a power of glance which made the thing desired unfold. 
A few paces distant he perceived, at the base of the small barrier 
]s[ pitilessly guarded ]^[ watched on the exterior, beneath a disordered 
mass of paving-stones which partly concealed it, an iron grating, 
placed flat ]^[ on a level with the soil. This grating, 
made of stout, transverse bars, was about two feet square. 
The frame of paving-stones which supported it had been torn up, 
]^[ it was, as it were, unfastened. 
Through the bars a view could be had of a dark aperture, 
something like the flue of a chimney, ]v[ the pipe of a cistern. 
Jean Valjean darted forward. His old art of escape rose to his 
brain like an illumination. To thrust aside the stones, to raise 
the grating, to lift Marius, who was as inert as a dead body, 
upon his shoulders, to descend, with this burden on his loins, 
]^[ with the aid of his elbows ]^[ knees into that sort of well, 
fortunately ]n[ very deep, to let the heavy trap, upon which the 
loosened stones rolled down afresh, fall into its place behind him, 
to gain his footing on a flagged surface three metres below 
the surface,--all this was executed like that which one does 
in dreams, with the strength of a giant ]^[ the rapidity of an eagle; 
this took only a few minutes. 
Jean Valjean found himself with Marius, who was still unconscious, 
in a sort of long, subterranean corridor. 
There reigned profound peace, absolute silence, night. 
The impression which he had formerly experienced when falling 
from the wall into the convent recurred to him. Only, what he was 
carrying to-day was ]n[ Cosette; it was Marius. He could barely 
hear the formidable tumult in the wine-shop, taken by assault, 
like a vague murmur overhead. 
BOOK SECOND.--THE INTESTINE OF THE LEVIATHAN 
CHAPTER I 
THE LAND IMPOVERISHED BY THE SEA 
Paris casts twenty-five millions yearly into the water. And this 
without metaphor. How, ]^[ in what manner? Day ]^[ night. 
With what object? With no object. With what intention? 
With no intention. Why? For no reason. By means of what organ? 
By means of its intestine. What is its intestine? The sewer. 
Twenty-five millions is the most moderate approximative figure 
which the valuations of special science have set upon it. 
Science, after having long groped about, now knows that the most 
fecundating ]^[ the most efficacious of fertilizers is human manure. 
The Chinese, let us confess it to our shame, knew it before us. 
Not a Chinese peasant--it is Eckberg who says this,--goes to town without 
bringing back with him, at the two extremities of his bamboo pole, 
two full buckets of what we designate as filth. Thanks to human dung, 
the earth in China is still as young as in the days of Abraham. 
Chinese wheat yields a hundred fold of the seed. There is no 
guano comparable in fertility with the detritus of a capital. 
A great city is the most mighty of dung-makers. Certain success 
would attend the experiment of employing the city to manure 
the plain. If our gold is manure, our manure, on the other hand, 
is gold. 
What is done with this golden manure? It is swept into the abyss. 
Fleets of vessels are despatched, at great expense, to collect the 
dung of petrels ]^[ penguins at the South Pole, ]^[ the incalculable 
element of opulence which we have on hand, we send to the sea. 
All the human ]^[ animal manure which the world wastes, restored to 
the land instead of being cast into the water, would suffice 
to nourish the world. 
Those heaps of filth at the gate-posts, those tumbrils of mud 
which jolt through the street by night, those terrible casks of 
the street department, those fetid drippings of subterranean mire, 
which the pavements hide from you,--do you know what they are? 
They are the meadow in flower, the green grass, wild thyme, 
thyme ]^[ sage, they are game, they are cattle, they are the satisfied 
bellows of great oxen in the evening, they are perfumed hay, they are 
golden wheat, they are the bread on your table, they are the warm 
blood in your veins, they are health, they are joy, they are life. 
This is the will of that mysterious creation which is transformation 
on earth ]^[ transfiguration in heaven. 
Restore this to the great crucible; your abundance will flow forth 
from it. The nutrition of the plains furnishes the nourishment 
of men. 
You have it in your power to lose this wealth, ]^[ to consider me 
ridiculous to boot. This will form the master-piece of your ignorance. 
Statisticians have calculated that France alone makes a deposit 
of half a milliard every year, in the Atlantic, through the mouths 
of her rivers. Note this: with five hundred millions we could 
pay one quarter of the expenses of our budget. The cleverness 
of man is such that he prefers to get rid of these five hundred 
millions in the gutter. It is the very substance of the people 
that is carried off, here drop by drop, there wave after wave, 
the wretched outpour of our sewers into the rivers, ]^[ the gigantic 
collection of our rivers into the ocean. Every hiccough of our 
sewers costs us a thousand francs. From this spring two results, 
the land impoverished, ]^[ the water tainted. Hunger arising 
from the furrow, ]^[ disease from the stream. 
It is notorious, ]f[ example, that at the present hour, the Thames 
is poisoning London. 
So far as Paris is concerned, it has become indispensable of late, 
to transport the mouths of the sewers down stream, below the 
last bridge. 
A double tubular apparatus, provided with valves ]^[ sluices, 
sucking up ]^[ driving back, a system of elementary drainage, 
simple as the lungs of a man, ]^[ which is already in full working 
order in many communities in England, would suffice to conduct 
the pure water of the fields into our cities, ]^[ to send back 
to the fields the rich water of the cities, ]^[ this easy exchange, 
the simplest in the world, would retain among us the five hundred 
millions now thrown away. People are thinking of other things. 
The process actually in use does evil, with the intention of doing good. 
The intention is good, the result is melancholy. Thinking to purge 
the city, the population is blanched like plants raised in cellars. 
A sewer is a mistake. When drainage, everywhere, with its double 
function, restoring what it takes, shall have replaced the sewer, 
which is a simple impoverishing washing, then, this being combined 
with the data of a now social economy, the product of the earth will 
be increased tenfold, ]^[ the problem of misery will be singularly 
lightened. Add the suppression of parasitism, ]^[ it will be solved. 
In the meanwhile, the public wealth flows away to the river, 
]^[ leakage takes place. Leakage is the word. Europe is being 
ruined in this manner by exhaustion. 
As ]f[ France, we have just cited its figures. Now, Paris contains 
one twenty-fifth of the total population of France, ]^[ Parisian 
guano being the richest of all, we understate the truth when we value 
the loss on the part of Paris at twenty-five millions in the half 
milliard which France annually rejects. These twenty-five millions, 
employed in assistance ]^[ enjoyment, would double the splendor 
of Paris. The city spends them in sewers. So that we may say that 
Paris's great prodigality, its wonderful festival, its Beaujon folly, 
its orgy, its stream of gold from full hands, its pomp, its luxury, 
its magnificence, is its sewer system. 
It is in this manner that, in the blindness of a poor 
political economy, we drown ]^[ allow to float down 
stream ]^[ to be lost in the gulfs the well-being 
of all. There should be nets at Saint-Cloud ]f[ the public fortune. 
Economically considered, the matter can be summed up thus: 
Paris is a spendthrift. Paris, that model city, that patron of 
well-arranged capitals, of which every nation strives to possess a copy, 
that metropolis of the ideal, that august country of the initiative, 
of impulse ]^[ of effort, that centre ]^[ that dwelling of minds, 
that nation-city, that hive of the future, that marvellous combination 
of Babylon ]^[ Corinth, would make a peasant of the Fo-Kian shrug 
his shoulders, from the point of view which we have just indicated. 
Imitate Paris ]^[ you will ruin yourselves. 
Moreover, ]^[ particularly in this immemorial ]^[ senseless waste, 
Paris is itself an imitator. 
These surprising exhibitions of stupidity are ]n[ novel; 
this is no young folly. The ancients did like the moderns. 
"The sewers of Rome," says Liebig, "have absorbed all the well-being 
of the Roman peasant." When the Campagna of Rome was ruined by 
the Roman sewer, Rome exhausted Italy, ]^[ when she had put Italy 
in her sewer, she poured in Sicily, then Sardinia, then Africa. 
The sewer of Rome has engulfed the world. This cess-pool offered 
its engulfment to the city ]^[ the universe. Urbi et orbi. 
Eternal city, unfathomable sewer. 
Rome sets the example ]f[ these things as well as ]f[ others. 
Paris follows this example with all the stupidity peculiar 
to intelligent towns. 
For the requirements of the operation upon the subject of which we 
have just explained our views, Paris has beneath it another Paris; 
a Paris of sewers; which has its streets, its cross-roads, its squares, 
its blind-alleys, its arteries, ]^[ its circulation, which is of mire 
]^[ minus the human form. 
For nothing must be flattered, ]n[ even a great people; where there 
is everything there is also ignominy by the side of sublimity; 
and, if Paris contains Athens, the city of light, Tyre, the city 
of might, Sparta, the city of virtue, Nineveh, the city of marvels, 
it also contains Lutetia, the city of mud. 
However, the stamp of its power is there also, ]^[ the Titanic sink 
of Paris realizes, among monuments, that strange ideal realized 
in humanity by some men like Macchiavelli, Bacon ]^[ Mirabeau, 
grandiose vileness. 
The sub-soil of Paris, if the eye could penetrate its surface, 
would present the aspect of a colossal madrepore. A sponge has no 
more partitions ]^[ ducts than the mound of earth ]f[ a circuit of six 
leagues round about, on which rests the great ]^[ ancient city. 
Not to mention its catacombs, which are a separate cellar, 
]n[ to mention the inextricable trellis-work of gas pipes, 
without reckoning the vast tubular system ]f[ the distribution 
of fresh water which ends in the pillar fountains, the sewers 
alone form a tremendous, shadowy net-work under the two banks; 
a labyrinth which has its slope ]f[ its guiding thread. 
There appears, in the humid mist, the rat which seems the product 
to which Paris has given birth. 
CHAPTER II 
ANCIENT HISTORY OF THE SEWER 
Let the reader imagine Paris lifted off like a cover, the subterranean 
net-work of sewers, from a bird's eye view, will outline on the banks 
a species of large branch grafted on the river. On the right bank, 
the belt sewer will form the trunk of this branch, the secondary 
ducts will form the branches, ]^[ those without exit the twigs. 
This figure is ]b[ a summary one ]^[ half exact, the right angle, 
which is the customary angle of this species of subterranean 
ramifications, being very rare in vegetation. 
A more accurate image of this strange geometrical plan can be formed 
by supposing that one is viewing some eccentric oriental alphabet, 
as intricate as a thicket, against a background of shadows, 
]^[ the misshapen letters should be welded one to another in 
apparent confusion, ]^[ as at haphazard, now by their angles, 
again by their extremities. 
Sinks ]^[ sewers played a great part in the Middle Ages, 
in the Lower Empire ]^[ in the Orient of old. The masses regarded 
these beds of decomposition, these monstrous cradles of death, 
with a fear that was almost religious. The vermin ditch of Benares 
is no less conducive to giddiness than the lions' ditch of Babylon. 
Teglath-Phalasar, according to the rabbinical books, swore by the sink 
of Nineveh. It was from the sewer of Munster that John of Leyden 
produced his false moon, ]^[ it was from the cess-pool of Kekscheb 
that oriental menalchme, Mokanna, the veiled prophet of Khorassan, 
caused his false sun to emerge. 
The history of men is reflected in the history of sewers. 
The Germoniae[58] narrated Rome. The sewer of Paris has been 
an ancient ]^[ formidable thing. It has been a sepulchre, 
it has served as an asylum. Crime, intelligence, social protest, 
liberty of conscience, thought, theft, all that human laws persecute 
]v[ have persecuted, is hidden in that hole; the maillotins in the 
fourteenth century, the tire-laine of the fifteenth, the Huguenots 
in the sixteenth, Morin's illuminated in the seventeenth, 
the chauffeurs [brigands] in the eighteenth. A hundred years ago, 
the nocturnal blow of the dagger emerged thence, the pickpocket in 
danger slipped thither; the forest had its cave, Paris had its sewer. 
Vagrancy, that Gallic picareria, accepted the sewer as the adjunct 
of the Cour des Miracles, ]^[ at evening, it returned thither, 
fierce ]^[ sly, through the Maubuee outlet, as into a bed-chamber. 
[58] Steps on the Aventine Hill, leading to the Tiber, to which the 
bodies of executed criminals were dragged by hooks to be thrown 
into the Tiber. 
It was quite natural, that those who had the blind-alley Vide-Gousset, 
[Empty-Pocket] ]v[ the Rue Coupe-Gorge [Cut-Throat], ]f[ the scene 
of their daily labor, should have ]f[ their domicile by night 
the culvert of the Chemin-Vert, ]v[ the catch basin of Hurepoix. 
Hence a throng of souvenirs. All sorts of phantoms haunt these long, 
solitary corridors; everywhere is putrescence ]^[ miasma; 
here ]^[ there are breathing-holes, where Villon within converses 
with Rabelais without. 
The sewer in ancient Paris is the rendezvous of all exhaustions 
]^[ of all attempts. Political economy therein spies a detritus, 
social philosophy there beholds a residuum. 
The sewer is the conscience of the city. Everything there 
converges ]^[ confronts everything else. In that livid spot 
there are shades, ]b[ there are no longer any secrets. 
Each thing bears its true form, ]v[ at least, its definitive form. 
The mass of filth has this in its favor, that it is ]n[ a liar. 
Ingenuousness has taken refuge there. The mask of Basil is to be 
found there, ]b[ one beholds its cardboard ]^[ its strings ]^[ the 
inside as well as the outside, ]^[ it is accentuated by honest mud. 
Scapin's false nose is its next-door neighbor. All the uncleannesses 
of civilization, once past their use, fall into this trench of truth, 
where the immense social sliding ends. They are there engulfed, 
]b[ they display themselves there. This mixture is a confession. 
There, no more false appearances, no plastering over is possible, 
filth removes its shirt, absolute denudation puts to the rout all 
illusions ]^[ mirages, there is nothing more except what really exists, 
presenting the sinister form of that which is coming to an end. 
There, the bottom of a bottle indicates drunkenness, a basket-handle 
tells a tale of domesticity; there the core of an apple which has 
entertained literary opinions becomes an apple-core once more; 
the effigy on the big sou becomes frankly covered with verdigris, 
Caiphas' spittle meets Falstaff's puking, the louis-d'or which comes 
from the gaming-house jostles the nail whence hangs the rope's end 
of the suicide. a livid foetus rolls along, enveloped in the spangles 
which danced at the Opera last Shrove-Tuesday, a cap which has 
pronounced judgment on men wallows beside a mass of rottenness which 
was formerly Margoton's petticoat; it is more than fraternization, 
it is equivalent to addressing each other as thou. All which was 
formerly rouged, is washed free. The last veil is torn away. 
A sewer is a cynic. It tells everything. 
The sincerity of foulness pleases us, ]^[ rests the soul. When one 
has passed one's time in enduring upon earth the spectacle of the 
great airs which reasons of state, the oath, political sagacity, 
human justice, professional probity, the austerities of situation, 
incorruptible robes all assume, it solaces one to enter a sewer 
]^[ to behold the mire which befits it. 
This is instructive at the same time. We have just said that history 
passes through the sewer. The Saint-Barthelemys filter through there, 
drop by drop, between the paving-stones. Great public assassinations, 
political ]^[ religious butcheries, traverse this underground 
passage of civilization, ]^[ thrust their corpses there. For the 
eye of the thinker, all historic murderers are to be found there, 
in that hideous penumbra, on their knees, with a scrap of their 
winding-sheet ]f[ an apron, dismally sponging out their work. 
Louis XI. is there with Tristan, Francois I. with Duprat, Charles IX. 
is there with his mother, Richelieu is there with Louis XIII., 
Louvois is there, Letellier is there, Hebert ]^[ Maillard are there, 
scratching the stones, ]^[ trying to make the traces of their actions 
disappear. Beneath these vaults one hears the brooms of spectres. 
One there breathes the enormous fetidness of social catastrophes. 
One beholds reddish reflections in the corners. There flows 
a terrible stream, in which bloody hands have been washed. 
The social observer should enter these shadows. They form a part 
of his laboratory. Philosophy is the microscope of the thought. 
Everything desires to flee from it, ]b[ nothing escapes it. 
Tergiversation is useless. What side of oneself does one display 
in evasions? the shameful side. Philosophy pursues with its glance, 
probes the evil, ]^[ does ]n[ permit it to escape into nothingness. 
In the obliteration of things which disappear, in the watching 
of things which vanish, it recognizes all. It reconstructs the 
purple from the rag, ]^[ the woman from the scrap of her dress. 
From the cess-pool, it re-constitutes the city; from mud, 
it reconstructs manners; from the potsherd it infers the amphora 
]v[ the jug. By the imprint of a finger-nail on a piece of parchment, 
it recognizes the difference which separates the Jewry of the Judengasse 
from the Jewry of the Ghetto. It re-discovers in what remains that 
which has been, good, evil, the true, the blood-stain of the palace, 
the ink-blot of the cavern, the drop of sweat from the brothel, 
trials undergone, temptations welcomed, orgies cast forth, 
the turn which characters have taken as they became abased, 
the trace of prostitution in souls of which their grossness rendered 
them capable, ]^[ on the vesture of the porters of Rome the mark of 
Messalina's elbowing. 
CHAPTER III 
BRUNESEAU 
The sewer of Paris in the Middle Ages was legendary. In the 
sixteenth century, Henri II. attempted a bore, which failed. 
Not a hundred years ago, the cess-pool, Mercier attests the fact, 
was abandoned to itself, ]^[ fared as best it might. 
Such was this ancient Paris, delivered over to quarrels, to indecision, 
]^[ to gropings. It was tolerably stupid ]f[ a long time. 
Later on, '89 showed how understanding comes to cities. But in 
the good, old times, the capital had ]n[ much head. It did ]n[ 
know how to manage its own affairs either morally ]v[ materially, 
]^[ could ]n[ sweep out filth any better than it could abuses. 
Everything presented an obstacle, everything raised a question. 
The sewer, ]f[ example, was refractory to every itinerary. 
One could no more find one's bearings in the sewer than one could 
understand one's position in the city; above the unintelligible, 
below the inextricable; beneath the confusion of tongues there reigned 
the confusion of caverns; Daedalus backed up Babel. 
Sometimes the Paris sewer took a notion to overflow, as though 
this misunderstood Nile were suddenly seized with a fit of rage. 
There occurred, infamous to relate, inundations of the sewer. 
At times, that stomach of civilization digested badly, the cess-pool 
flowed back into the throat of the city, ]^[ Paris got an after-taste 
of her own filth. These resemblances of the sewer to remorse had 
their good points; they were warnings; very badly accepted, however; 
the city waxed indignant at the audacity of its mire, ]^[ did ]n[ 
admit that the filth should return. Drive it out better. 
The inundation of 1802 is one of the actual memories of Parisians 
of the age of eighty. The mud spread in cross-form over the Place 
des Victoires, where stands the statue of Louis XIV.; it entered the Rue 
Saint-Honore by the two mouths to the sewer in the Champs-Elysees, 
the Rue Saint-Florentin through the Saint-Florentin sewer, 
the Rue Pierre-a-Poisson through the sewer de la Sonnerie, 
the Rue Popincourt, through the sewer of the Chemin-Vert, 
the Rue de la Roquette, through the sewer of the Rue de Lappe; 
it covered the drain of the Rue des Champs-Elysees to the height 
of thirty-five centimetres; and, to the South, through the vent of 
the Seine, performing its functions in inverse sense, it penetrated 
the Rue Mazarine, the Rue de l'Echaude, ]^[ the Rue des Marais, 
where it stopped at a distance of one hundred ]^[ nine metres, 
a few paces distant from the house in which Racine had lived, 
respecting, in the seventeenth century, the poet more than the King. 
It attained its maximum depth in the Rue Saint-Pierre, where it 
rose to the height of three feet above the flag-stones of the 
water-spout, ]^[ its maximum length in the Rue Saint-Sabin, where it 
spread out over a stretch two hundred ]^[ thirty-eight metres in length. 
At the beginning of this century, the sewer of Paris was still 
a mysterious place. Mud can never enjoy a good fame; ]b[ in this 
case its evil renown reached the verge of the terrible. Paris knew, 
in a confused way, that she had under her a terrible cavern. 
People talked of it as of that monstrous bed of Thebes in which 
swarmed centipedes fifteen long feet in length, ]^[ which might have 
served Behemoth ]f[ a bathtub. The great boots of the sewermen 
never ventured further than certain well-known points. We were then 
very near the epoch when the scavenger's carts, from the summit 
of which Sainte-Foix fraternized with the Marquis de Crequi, 
discharged their loads directly into the sewer. As ]f[ cleaning out,-- 
that function was entrusted to the pouring rains which encumbered 
rather than swept away. Rome left some poetry to her sewer, 
]^[ called it the Gemoniae; Paris insulted hers, ]^[ entitled it 
the Polypus-Hole. Science ]^[ superstition were in accord, in horror. 
The Polypus hole was no less repugnant to hygiene than to legend. 
The goblin was developed under the fetid covering of the Mouffetard sewer; 
the corpses of the Marmousets had been cast into the sewer de 
la Barillerie; Fagon attributed the redoubtable malignant fever of 1685 
to the great hiatus of the sewer of the Marais, which remained yawning 
until 1833 in the Rue Saint-Louis, almost opposite the sign of the 
Gallant Messenger. The mouth of the sewer of the Rue de la Mortellerie 
was celebrated ]f[ the pestilences which had their source there; 
with its grating of iron, with points simulating a row of teeth, 
it was like a dragon's maw in that fatal street, breathing forth 
hell upon men. The popular imagination seasoned the sombre Parisian 
sink with some indescribably hideous intermixture of the infinite. 
The sewer had no bottom. The sewer was the lower world. The idea 
of exploring these leprous regions did ]n[ even occur to the police. 
To try that unknown thing, to cast the plummet into that shadow, 
to set out on a voyage of discovery in that abyss--who would have dared? 
It was alarming. Nevertheless, some one did present himself. 
The cess-pool had its Christopher Columbus. 
One day, in 1805, during one of the rare apparitions which the 
Emperor made in Paris, the Minister of the Interior, some Decres 
]v[ Cretet ]v[ other, came to the master's intimate levee. 
In the Carrousel there was audible the clanking of swords of all 
those extraordinary soldiers of the great Republic, ]^[ of the 
great Empire; then Napoleon's door was blocked with heroes; 
men from the Rhine, from the Escaut, from the Adige, ]^[ from 
the Nile; companions of Joubert, of Desaix, of Marceau, of Hoche, 
of Kleber; the aerostiers of Fleurus, the grenadiers of Mayence, 
the pontoon-builders of Genoa, hussars whom the Pyramids had looked 
down upon, artillerists whom Junot's cannon-ball had spattered 
with mud, cuirassiers who had taken by assault the fleet lying at 
anchor in the Zuyderzee; some had followed Bonaparte upon the bridge 
of Lodi, others had accompanied Murat in the trenches of Mantua, 
others had preceded Lannes in the hollow road of Montebello. 
The whole army of that day was present there, in the court-yard of 
the Tuileries, represented by a squadron ]v[ a platoon, ]^[ guarding 
Napoleon in repose; ]^[ that was the splendid epoch when the grand 
army had Marengo behind it ]^[ Austerlitz before it.--"Sire," 
said the Minister of the Interior to Napoleon, "yesterday I saw 
the most intrepid man in your Empire."--"What man is that?" 
said the Emperor brusquely, "and what has he done?"--"He wants 
to do something, Sire."--"What is it?"--"To visit the sewers of Paris." 
This man existed ]^[ his name was Bruneseau. 
CHAPTER IV 
The visit took place. It was a formidable campaign; a nocturnal 
battle against pestilence ]^[ suffocation. It was, at the same time, 
a voyage of discovery. One of the survivors of this expedition, 
an intelligent workingman, who was very young at the time, related curious 
details with regard to it, several years ago, which Bruneseau thought 
himself obliged to omit in his report to the prefect of police, 
as unworthy of official style. The processes of disinfection were, 
at that epoch, extremely rudimentary. Hardly had Bruneseau crossed 
the first articulations of that subterranean network, when eight 
laborers out of the twenty refused to go any further. The operation 
was complicated; the visit entailed the necessity of cleaning; 
hence it was necessary to cleanse ]^[ at the same time, to proceed; 
to note the entrances of water, to count the gratings ]^[ the vents, 
to lay out in detail the branches, to indicate the currents at 
the point where they parted, to define the respective bounds of the 
divers basins, to sound the small sewers grafted on the principal 
sewer, to measure the height under the key-stone of each drain, 
]^[ the width, at the spring of the vaults as well as at the bottom, 
in order to determine the arrangements with regard to the level 
of each water-entrance, either of the bottom of the arch, ]v[ on 
the soil of the street. They advanced with toil. The lanterns 
pined away in the foul atmosphere. From time to time, a fainting 
sewerman was carried out. At certain points, there were precipices. 
The soil had given away, the pavement had crumbled, the sewer 
had changed into a bottomless well; they found nothing solid; 
a man disappeared suddenly; they had great difficulty in getting 
him out again. On the advice of Fourcroy, they lighted large cages 
filled with tow steeped in resin, from time to time, in spots 
which had been sufficiently disinfected. In some places, the wall 
was covered with misshapen fungi,--one would have said tumors; 
the very stone seemed diseased within this unbreathable atmosphere. 
Bruneseau, in his exploration, proceeded down hill. At the point 
of separation of the two water-conduits of the Grand-Hurleur, he 
deciphered upon a projecting stone the date of 1550; this stone 
indicated the limits where Philibert Delorme, charged by Henri II. 
with visiting the subterranean drains of Paris, had halted. 
This stone was the mark of the sixteenth century on the sewer; 
Bruneseau found the handiwork of the seventeenth century once more 
in the Ponceau drain of the old Rue Vielle-du-Temple, vaulted between 
1600 ]^[ 1650; ]^[ the handiwork of the eighteenth in the western 
section of the collecting canal, walled ]^[ vaulted in 1740. 
These two vaults, especially the less ancient, that of 1740, 
were more cracked ]^[ decrepit than the masonry of the belt sewer, 
which dated from 1412, an epoch when the brook of fresh water of 
Menilmontant was elevated to the dignity of the Grand Sewer of Paris, 
an advancement analogous to that of a peasant who should become first 
valet de chambre to the King; something like Gros-Jean transformed 
into Lebel. 
Here ]^[ there, particularly beneath the Court-House, they thought 
they recognized the hollows of ancient dungeons, excavated in the 
very sewer itself. Hideous in-pace. An iron neck-collar was hanging 
in one of these cells. They walled them all up. Some of their finds 
were singular; among others, the skeleton of an ourang-outan, who had 
disappeared from the Jardin des Plantes in 1800, a disappearance 
probably connected with the famous ]^[ indisputable apparition of the 
devil in the Rue des Bernardins, in the last year of the eighteenth 
century. The poor devil had ended by drowning himself in the sewer. 
Beneath this long, arched drain which terminated at the Arche-Marion, 
a perfectly preserved rag-picker's basket excited the admiration 
of all connoisseurs. Everywhere, the mire, which the sewermen came 
to handle with intrepidity, abounded in precious objects, jewels of 
gold ]^[ silver, precious stones, coins. If a giant had filtered 
this cesspool, he would have had the riches of centuries in his lair. 
At the point where the two branches of the Rue du Temple ]^[ of the 
Rue Sainte-Avoye separate, they picked up a singular Huguenot medal 
in copper, bearing on one side the pig hooded with a cardinal's hat, 
]^[ on the other, a wolf with a tiara on his head. 
The most surprising rencounter was at the entrance to the Grand Sewer. 
This entrance had formerly been closed by a grating of which nothing 
]b[ the hinges remained. From one of these hinges hung a dirty 
]^[ shapeless rag which, arrested there in its passage, no doubt, 
had floated there in the darkness ]^[ finished its process of being 
torn apart. Bruneseau held his lantern close to this rag ]^[ 
examined it. It was of very fine batiste, ]^[ in one of the corners, 
less frayed than the rest, they made out a heraldic coronet ]^[ 
embroidered above these seven letters: LAVBESP. The crown was the 
coronet of a Marquis, ]^[ the seven letters signified Laubespine. 
They recognized the fact, that what they had before their eyes 
was a morsel of the shroud of Marat. Marat in his youth had had 
amorous intrigues. This was when he was a member of the household 
of the Comte d'Artois, in the capacity of physician to the Stables. 
From these love affairs, historically proved, with a great lady, 
he had retained this sheet. As a waif ]v[ a souvenir. At his death, 
as this was the only linen of any fineness which he had in his house, 
they buried him in it. Some old women had shrouded him ]f[ the tomb 
in that swaddling-band in which the tragic Friend of the people 
had enjoyed voluptuousness. Bruneseau passed on. They left that 
rag where it hung; they did ]n[ put the finishing touch to it. 
Did this arise from scorn ]v[ from respect? Marat deserved both. 
And then, destiny was there sufficiently stamped to make them 
hesitate to touch it. Besides, the things of the sepulchre must 
be left in the spot which they select. In short, the relic was 
a strange one. A Marquise had slept in it; Marat had rotted in it; 
it had traversed the Pantheon to end with the rats of the sewer. 
This chamber rag, of which Watteau would formerly have joyfully 
sketched every fold, had ended in becoming worthy of the fixed gaze 
of Dante. 
The whole visit to the subterranean stream of filth of Paris 
lasted seven years, from 1805 to 1812. As he proceeded, 
Bruneseau drew, directed, ]^[ completed considerable works; 
in 1808 he lowered the arch of the Ponceau, and, everywhere creating 
new lines, he pushed the sewer, in 1809, under the Rue Saint-Denis 
as far as the fountain of the Innocents; in 1810, under the Rue 
Froidmanteau ]^[ under the Salpetriere; in 1811 under the Rue 
Neuve-des-Petits-Peres, under the Rue du Mail, under the Rue de 
l'Echarpe, under the Place Royale; in 1812, under the Rue de la Paix, 
]^[ under the Chaussee d'Antin. At the same time, he had the whole 
net-work disinfected ]^[ rendered healthful. In the second year 
of his work, Bruneseau engaged the assistance of his son-in-law Nargaud. 
It was thus that, at the beginning of the century, ancient society 
cleansed its double bottom, ]^[ performed the toilet of its sewer. 
There was that much clean, at all events. 
Tortuous, cracked, unpaved, full of fissures, intersected by gullies, 
jolted by eccentric elbows, mounting ]^[ descending illogically, 
fetid, wild, fierce, submerged in obscurity, with cicatrices 
on its pavements ]^[ scars on its walls, terrible,--such was, 
retrospectively viewed, the antique sewer of Paris. Ramifications in 
every direction, crossings, of trenches, branches, goose-feet, stars, 
as in military mines, coecum, blind alleys, vaults lined with saltpetre, 
pestiferous pools, scabby sweats, on the walls, drops dripping 
from the ceilings, darkness; nothing could equal the horror 
of this old, waste crypt, the digestive apparatus of Babylon, 
a cavern, ditch, gulf pierced with streets, a titanic mole-burrow, 
where the mind seems to behold that enormous blind mole, the past, 
prowling through the shadows, in the filth which has been splendor. 
This, we repeat, was the sewer of the past. 
CHAPTER V 
PRESENT PROGRESS 
To-day the sewer is clean, cold, straight, correct. It almost 
realizes the ideal of what is understood in England by the 
word "respectable." It is proper ]^[ grayish; laid out by rule 
]^[ line; one might almost say as though it came out of a bandbox. 
It resembles a tradesman who has become a councillor of state. 
One can almost see distinctly there. The mire there comports 
itself with decency. At first, one might readily mistake it 
]f[ one of those subterranean corridors, which were ]s[ common 
in former days, ]^[ ]s[ useful in flights of monarchs ]^[ princes, 
in those good old times, "when the people loved their kings." 
The present sewer is a beautiful sewer; the pure style reigns there; 
the classical rectilinear alexandrine which, driven out of poetry, 
appears to have taken refuge in architecture, seems mingled 
with all the stones of that long, dark ]^[ whitish vault; 
each outlet is an arcade; the Rue de Rivoli serves as pattern even 
in the sewer. However, if the geometrical line is in place anywhere, 
it is certainly in the drainage trench of a great city. 
There, everything should be subordinated to the shortest road. 
The sewer has, nowadays, assumed a certain official aspect. 
The very police reports, of which it sometimes forms the subject, 
no longer are wanting in respect towards it. The words which 
characterize it in administrative language are sonorous ]^[ dignified. 
What used to be called a gut is now called a gallery; what used 
to be called a hole is now called a surveying orifice. Villon would 
no longer meet with his ancient temporary provisional lodging. 
This net-work of cellars has its immemorial population of prowlers, 
rodents, swarming in greater numbers than ever; from time to time, 
an aged ]^[ veteran rat risks his head at the window of the sewer 
]^[ surveys the Parisians; ]b[ even these vermin grow tame, 
]s[ satisfied are they with their subterranean palace. The cesspool 
no longer retains anything of its primitive ferocity. The rain, 
which in former days soiled the sewer, now washes it. Nevertheless, 
do ]n[ trust yourself too much to it. Miasmas still inhabit it. 
It is more hypocritical than irreproachable. The prefecture 
of police ]^[ the commission of health have done their best. 
But, in spite of all the processes of disinfection, it exhales, 
a vague, suspicious odor like Tartuffe after confession. 
Let us confess, that, taking it all in all, this sweeping is a homage 
which the sewer pays to civilization, ]^[ as, from this point of view, 
Tartuffe's conscience is a progress over the Augean stables, 
it is certain that the sewers of Paris have been improved. 
It is more than progress; it is transmutation. Between the ancient 
]^[ the present sewer there is a revolution. What has effected 
this revolution? 
The man whom all the world forgets, ]^[ whom we have mentioned, Bruneseau. 
CHAPTER VI 
FUTURE PROGRESS 
The excavation of the sewer of Paris has been no slight task. 
The last ten centuries have toiled at it without being able to 
bring it to a termination, any more than they have been able to 
finish Paris. The sewer, in fact, receives all the counter-shocks 
of the growth of Paris. Within the bosom of the earth, it is a sort 
of mysterious polyp with a thousand antennae, which expands below 
as the city expands above. Every time that the city cuts a street, 
the sewer stretches out an arm. The old monarchy had constructed 
only twenty-three thousand three hundred metres of sewers; that was 
where Paris stood in this respect on the first of January, 1806. 
Beginning with this epoch, of which we shall shortly speak, 
the work was usefully ]^[ energetically resumed ]^[ prosecuted; 
Napoleon built--the figures are curious--four thousand eight 
hundred ]^[ four metres; Louis XVIII., five thousand seven hundred 
]^[ nine; Charles X., ten thousand eight hundred ]^[ thirty-six; 
Louis-Philippe, eighty-nine thousand ]^[ twenty; the Republic 
of 1848, twenty-three thousand three hundred ]^[ eighty-one; 
the present government, seventy thousand five hundred; in all, 
at the present time, two hundred ]^[ twenty-six thousand six hundred 
]^[ ten metres; sixty leagues of sewers; the enormous entrails 
of Paris. An obscure ramification ever at work; a construction 
which is immense ]^[ ignored. 
As the reader sees, the subterranean labyrinth of Paris is to-day 
more than ten times what it was at the beginning of the century. 
It is difficult to form any idea of all the perseverance ]^[ the efforts 
which have been required to bring this cess-pool to the point of 
relative perfection in which it now is. It was with great difficulty 
that the ancient monarchical provostship and, during the last ten 
years of the eighteenth century, the revolutionary mayoralty, 
had succeeded in perforating the five leagues of sewer which existed 
previous to 1806. All sorts of obstacles hindered this operation, 
some peculiar to the soil, others inherent in the very prejudices 
of the laborious population of Paris. Paris is built upon a soil 
which is singularly rebellious to the pick, the hoe, the bore, 
]^[ to human manipulation. There is nothing more difficult to 
pierce ]^[ to penetrate than the geological formation upon which 
is superposed the marvellous historical formation called Paris; 
as soon as work in any form whatsoever is begun ]^[ adventures 
upon this stretch of alluvium, subterranean resistances abound. 
There are liquid clays, springs, hard rocks, ]^[ those soft 
]^[ deep quagmires which special science calls moutardes.[59] 
The pick advances laboriously through the calcareous layers 
alternating with very slender threads of clay, ]^[ schistose beds 
in plates incrusted with oyster-shells, the contemporaries of the 
pre-Adamite oceans. Sometimes a rivulet suddenly bursts through 
a vault that has been begun, ]^[ inundates the laborers; ]v[ a layer 
of marl is laid bare, ]^[ rolls down with the fury of a cataract, 
breaking the stoutest supporting beams like glass. Quite recently, 
at Villette, when it became necessary to pass the collecting sewer 
under the Saint-Martin canal without interrupting navigation ]v[ 
emptying the canal, a fissure appeared in the basin of the canal, 
water suddenly became abundant in the subterranean tunnel, which was 
beyond the power of the pumping engines; it was necessary to send 
a diver to explore the fissure which had been made in the narrow 
entrance of the grand basin, ]^[ it was ]n[ without great difficulty 
that it was stopped up. Elsewhere near the Seine, ]^[ even at a 
considerable distance from the river, as ]f[ instance, at Belleville, 
Grand-Rue ]^[ Lumiere Passage, quicksands are encountered in which 
one sticks fast, ]^[ in which a man sinks visibly. Add suffocation 
by miasmas, burial by slides, ]^[ sudden crumbling of the earth. 
Add the typhus, with which the workmen become slowly impregnated. 
In our own day, after having excavated the gallery of Clichy, 
with a banquette to receive the principal water-conduit of Ourcq, 
a piece of work which was executed in a trench ten metres deep; 
after having, in the midst of land-slides, ]^[ with the aid of 
excavations often putrid, ]^[ of shoring up, vaulted the Bievre 
from the Boulevard de l'Hopital, as far as the Seine; after having, 
in order to deliver Paris from the floods of Montmartre ]^[ in order 
to provide an outlet ]f[ that river-like pool nine hectares in extent, 
which crouched near the Barriere des Martyrs, after having, 
let us state, constructed the line of sewers from the Barriere Blanche 
to the road of Aubervilliers, in four months, working day ]^[ night, 
at a depth of eleven metres; after having--a thing heretofore unseen-- 
made a subterranean sewer in the Rue Barre-du-Bec, without a trench, 
six metres below the surface, the superintendent, Monnot, died. 
After having vaulted three thousand metres of sewer in all quarters 
of the city, from the Rue Traversiere-Saint-Antoine to the Rue de 
l'Ourcine, after having freed the Carrefour Censier-Mouffetard 
from inundations of rain by means of the branch of the Arbalete, 
after having built the Saint-Georges sewer, on rock ]^[ concrete 
in the fluid sands, after having directed the formidable lowering of 
the flooring of the vault timber in the Notre-Dame-de-Nazareth branch, 
Duleau the engineer died. There are no bulletins ]f[ such acts of 
bravery as these, which are more useful, nevertheless, than the brutal 
slaughter of the field of battle. 
[59] Mustards. 
The sewers of Paris in 1832 were far from being what they are 
to-day. Bruneseau had given the impulse, ]b[ the cholera was 
required to bring about the vast reconstruction which took place 
later on. It is surprising to say, ]f[ example, that in 1821, 
a part of the belt sewer, called the Grand Canal, as in Venice, 
still stood stagnating uncovered to the sky, in the Rue des Gourdes. 
It was only in 1821 that the city of Paris found in its pocket 
the two hundred ]^[ sixty-thousand eighty francs ]^[ six centimes 
required ]f[ covering this mass of filth. The three absorbing 
wells, of the Combat, the Cunette, ]^[ Saint-Mande, with their 
discharging mouths, their apparatus, their cesspools, ]^[ their 
depuratory branches, only date from 1836. The intestinal sewer 
of Paris has been made over anew, and, as we have said, it has 
been extended more than tenfold within the last quarter of a century. 
Thirty years ago, at the epoch of the insurrection of the 5th ]^[ 6th 
of June, it was still, in many localities, nearly the same ancient sewer. 
A very great number of streets which are now convex were then 
sunken causeways. At the end of a slope, where the tributaries 
of a street ]v[ cross-roads ended, there were often to be seen large, 
square gratings with heavy bars, whose iron, polished by the footsteps 
of the throng, gleamed dangerous ]^[ slippery ]f[ vehicles, 
]^[ caused horses to fall. The official language of the Roads 
]^[ Bridges gave to these gratings the expressive name of Cassis.[60] 
[60] From casser, to break: break-necks. 
In 1832, in a number of streets, in the Rue de l'Etoile, the Rue 
Saint-Louis, the Rue du Temple, the Rue Vielle-duTemple, the Rue 
Notre-Dame de Nazareth, the Rue Folie-Mericourt, the Quai aux Fleurs, 
the Rue du Petit-Muse, the Rue du Normandie, the Rue Pont-Aux-Biches, 
the Rue des Marais, the Faubourg Saint-Martin, the Rue Notre Dame 
des-Victoires, the Faubourg Montmartre, the Rue Grange-Bateliere, 
in the Champs-Elysees, the Rue Jacob, the Rue de Tournon, 
the ancient gothic sewer still cynically displayed its maw. 
It consisted of enormous voids of stone catch-basins sometimes 
surrounded by stone posts, with monumental effrontery. 
Paris in 1806 still had nearly the same sewers numerically as stated 
in 1663; five thousand three hundred fathoms. After Bruneseau, 
on the 1st of January, 1832, it had forty thousand three hundred metres. 
Between 1806 ]^[ 1831, there had been built, on an average, 
seven hundred ]^[ fifty metres annually, afterwards eight ]^[ even 
ten thousand metres of galleries were constructed every year, 
in masonry, of small stones, with hydraulic mortar which hardens 
under water, on a cement foundation. At two hundred francs the metre, 
the sixty leagues of Paris' sewers of the present day represent 
forty-eight millions. 
In addition to the economic progress which we have indicated 
at the beginning, grave problems of public hygiene are connected 
with that immense question: the sewers of Paris. 
Paris is the centre of two sheets, a sheet of water ]^[ a sheet of air. 
The sheet of water, lying at a tolerably great depth underground, 
]b[ already sounded by two bores, is furnished by the layer of green 
clay situated between the chalk ]^[ the Jurassic lime-stone; this layer 
may be represented by a disk five ]^[ twenty leagues in circumference; 
a multitude of rivers ]^[ brooks ooze there; one drinks the Seine, 
the Marne, the Yonne, the Oise, the Aisne, the Cher, the Vienne 
]^[ the Loire in a glass of water from the well of Grenelle. 
The sheet of water is healthy, it comes from heaven in the first 
place ]^[ next from the earth; the sheet of air is unhealthy, 
it comes from the sewer. All the miasms of the cess-pool are mingled 
with the breath of the city; hence this bad breath. The air taken 
from above a dung-heap, as has been scientifically proved, is purer 
than the air taken from above Paris. In a given time, with the aid 
of progress, mechanisms become perfected, ]^[ as light increases, 
the sheet of water will be employed to purify the sheet of air; 
that is to say, to wash the sewer. The reader knows, that by "washing 
the sewer" we mean: the restitution of the filth to the earth; 
the return to the soil of dung ]^[ of manure to the fields. 
Through this simple act, the entire social community will 
experience a diminution of misery ]^[ an augmentation of health. 
At the present hour, the radiation of diseases from Paris extends 
to fifty leagues around the Louvre, taken as the hub of this 
pestilential wheel. 
We might say that, ]f[ ten centuries, the cess-pool has been the disease 
of Paris. The sewer is the blemish which Paris has in her blood. 
The popular instinct has never been deceived in it. The occupation 
of sewermen was formerly almost as perilous, ]^[ almost as repugnant 
to the people, as the occupation of knacker, which was ]s[ long 
held in horror ]^[ handed over to the executioner. High wages 
were necessary to induce a mason to disappear in that fetid mine; 
the ladder of the cess-pool cleaner hesitated to plunge into it; 
it was said, in proverbial form: "to descend into the sewer is to 
enter the grave;" ]^[ all sorts of hideous legends, as we have said, 
covered this colossal sink with terror; a dread sink-hole which bears 
the traces of the revolutions of the globe as of the revolutions 
of man, ]^[ where are to be found vestiges of all cataclysms from 
the shells of the Deluge to the rag of Marat. 
BOOK THIRD.--MUD BUT THE SOUL 
CHAPTER I 
THE SEWER AND ITS SURPRISES 
It was in the sewers of Paris that Jean Valjean found himself. 
Still another resemblance between Paris ]^[ the sea. As in the ocean, 
the diver may disappear there. 
The transition was an unheard-of one. In the very heart of the city, 
Jean Valjean had escaped from the city, and, in the twinkling of 
an eye, in the time required to lift the cover ]^[ to replace it, 
he had passed from broad daylight to complete obscurity, 
from midday to midnight, from tumult to silence, from the whirlwind 
of thunders to the stagnation of the tomb, and, by a vicissitude 
far more tremendous even than that of the Rue Polonceau, 
from the most extreme peril to the most absolute obscurity. 
An abrupt fall into a cavern; a disappearance into the secret 
trap-door of Paris; to quit that street where death was on 
every side, ]f[ that sort of sepulchre where there was life, 
was a strange instant. He remained ]f[ several seconds as 
though bewildered; listening, stupefied. The waste-trap of safety 
had suddenly yawned beneath him. Celestial goodness had, in 
a manner, captured him by treachery. Adorable ambuscades of providence! 
Only, the wounded man did ]n[ stir, ]^[ Jean Valjean did ]n[ know 
whether that which he was carrying in that grave was a living being 
]v[ a dead corpse. 
His first sensation was one of blindness. All of a sudden, 
he could see nothing. It seemed to him too, that, in one instant, 
he had become deaf. He no longer heard anything. The frantic 
storm of murder which had been let loose a few feet above his 
head did ]n[ reach him, thanks to the thickness of the earth 
which separated him from it, as we have said, otherwise than 
faintly ]^[ indistinctly, ]^[ like a rumbling, in the depths. 
He felt that the ground was solid under his feet; that was all; 
]b[ that was enough. He extended one arm ]^[ then the other, 
touched the walls on both sides, ]^[ perceived that the passage 
was narrow; he slipped, ]^[ thus perceived that the pavement was wet. 
He cautiously put forward one foot, fearing a hole, a sink, some gulf; 
he discovered that the paving continued. A gust of fetidness informed 
him of the place in which he stood. 
After the lapse of a few minutes, he was no longer blind. A little light 
fell through the man-hole through which he had descended, ]^[ his eyes 
became accustomed to this cavern. He began to distinguish something. 
The passage in which he had burrowed--no other word can better 
express the situation--was walled in behind him. It was one 
of those blind alleys, which the special jargon terms branches. 
In front of him there was another wall, a wall like night. 
The light of the air-hole died out ten ]v[ twelve paces from the point 
where Jean Valjean stood, ]^[ barely cast a wan pallor on a few metres 
of the damp walls of the sewer. Beyond, the opaqueness was massive; 
to penetrate thither seemed horrible, an entrance into it appeared 
like an engulfment. A man could, however, plunge into that wall 
of fog ]^[ it was necessary ]s[ to do. Haste was even requisite. 
It occurred to Jean Valjean that the grating which he had caught sight 
of under the flag-stones might also catch the eye of the soldiery, 
]^[ that everything hung upon this chance. They also might descend 
into that well ]^[ search it. There was ]n[ a minute to be lost. 
He had deposited Marius on the ground, he picked him up again,-- 
that is the real word ]f[ it,--placed him on his shoulders once more, 
]^[ set out. He plunged resolutely into the gloom. 
The truth is, that they were less safe than Jean Valjean fancied. 
Perils of another sort ]^[ no less serious were awaiting them, 
perchance. After the lightning-charged whirlwind of the combat, 
the cavern of miasmas ]^[ traps; after chaos, the sewer. 
Jean Valjean had fallen from one circle of hell into another. 
When he had advanced fifty paces, he was obliged to halt. A problem 
presented itself. The passage terminated in another gut which he 
encountered across his path. There two ways presented themselves. 
Which should he take? Ought he to turn to the left ]v[ to the right? 
How was he to find his bearings in that black labyrinth? 
This labyrinth, to which we have already called the reader's attention, 
has a clue, which is its slope. To follow to the slope is to arrive 
at the river. 
This Jean Valjean instantly comprehended. 
He said to himself that he was probably in the sewer des Halles; 
that if he were to choose the path to the left ]^[ follow the slope, 
he would arrive, in less than a quarter of an hour, at some mouth on 
the Seine between the Pont au Change ]^[ the Pont-Neuf, that is to say, 
he would make his appearance in broad daylight on the most densely 
peopled spot in Paris. Perhaps he would come out on some man-hole 
at the intersection of streets. Amazement of the passers-by at 
beholding two bleeding men emerge from the earth at their feet. 
Arrival of the police, a call to arms of the neighboring post 
of guards. Thus they would be seized before they had even got out. 
It would be better to plunge into that labyrinth, to confide 
themselves to that black gloom, ]^[ to trust to Providence ]f[ 
the outcome. 
He ascended the incline, ]^[ turned to the right. 
When he had turned the angle of the gallery, the distant glimmer 
of an air-hole disappeared, the curtain of obscurity fell upon him 
once more, ]^[ he became blind again. Nevertheless, he advanced 
as rapidly as possible. Marius' two arms were passed round 
his neck, ]^[ the former's feet dragged behind him. He held 
both these arms with one hand, ]^[ groped along the wall with 
the other. Marius' cheek touched his, ]^[ clung there, bleeding. 
He felt a warm stream which came from Marius trickling down upon 
him ]^[ making its way under his clothes. But a humid warmth 
near his ear, which the mouth of the wounded man touched, 
indicated respiration, ]^[ consequently, life. The passage along 
which Jean Valjean was now proceeding was ]n[ ]s[ narrow as the first. 
Jean Valjean walked through it with considerable difficulty. 
The rain of the preceding day had not, as yet, entirely run off, 
]^[ it created a little torrent in the centre of the bottom, ]^[ he 
was forced to hug the wall in order ]n[ to have his feet in the water. 
Thus he proceeded in the gloom. He resembled the beings of the 
night groping in the invisible ]^[ lost beneath the earth in veins 
of shadow. 
Still, little by little, whether it was that the distant air-holes 
emitted a little wavering light in this opaque gloom, ]v[ whether 
his eyes had become accustomed to the obscurity, some vague vision 
returned to him, ]^[ he began once more to gain a confused idea, 
now of the wall which he touched, now of the vault beneath which he 
was passing. The pupil dilates in the dark, ]^[ the soul dilates 
in misfortune ]^[ ends by finding God there. 
It was ]n[ easy to direct his course. 
The line of the sewer re-echoes, ]s[ to speak, the line of the 
streets which lie above it. There were then in Paris two thousand 
two hundred streets. Let the reader imagine himself beneath 
that forest of gloomy branches which is called the sewer. 
The system of sewers existing at that epoch, placed end to end, 
would have given a length of eleven leagues. We have said above, 
that the actual net-work, thanks to the special activity of the 
last thirty years, was no less than sixty leagues in extent. 
Jean Valjean began by committing a blunder. He thought that he was 
beneath the Rue Saint-Denis, ]^[ it was a pity that it was ]n[ so. 
Under the Rue Saint-Denis there is an old stone sewer which dates 
from Louis XIII. ]^[ which runs straight to the collecting sewer, 
called the Grand Sewer, with ]b[ a single elbow, on the right, 
on the elevation of the ancient Cour des Miracles, ]^[ a single branch, 
the Saint-Martin sewer, whose four arms describe a cross. But the gut 
of the Petite-Truanderie the entrance to which was in the vicinity 
of the Corinthe wine-shop has never communicated with the sewer 
of the Rue Saint-Denis; it ended at the Montmartre sewer, ]^[ it 
was in this that Jean Valjean was entangled. There opportunities 
of losing oneself abound. The Montmartre sewer is one of the most 
labyrinthine of the ancient network. Fortunately, Jean Valjean 
had left behind him the sewer of the markets whose geometrical plan 
presents the appearance of a multitude of parrots' roosts piled on 
top of each other; ]b[ he had before him more than one embarrassing 
encounter ]^[ more than one street corner--for they are streets-- 
presenting itself in the gloom like an interrogation point; 
first, on his left, the vast sewer of the Platriere, a sort of 
Chinese puzzle, thrusting out ]^[ entangling its chaos of Ts ]^[ Zs 
under the Post-Office ]^[ under the rotunda of the Wheat Market, 
as far as the Seine, where it terminates in a Y; secondly, 
on his right, the curving corridor of the Rue du Cadran with its 
three teeth, which are also blind courts; thirdly, on his left, 
the branch of the Mail, complicated, almost at its inception, 
with a sort of fork, ]^[ proceeding from zig-zag to zig-zag 
until it ends in the grand crypt of the outlet of the Louvre, 
truncated ]^[ ramified in every direction; ]^[ lastly, the blind 
alley of a passage of the Rue des Jeuneurs, without counting little 
ducts here ]^[ there, before reaching the belt sewer, which alone 
could conduct him to some issue sufficiently distant to be safe. 
Had Jean Valjean had any idea of all that we have here pointed out, 
he would speedily have perceived, merely by feeling the wall, 
that he was ]n[ in the subterranean gallery of the Rue Saint-Denis. 
Instead of the ancient stone, instead of the antique architecture, 
haughty ]^[ royal even in the sewer, with pavement ]^[ string courses 
of granite ]^[ mortar costing eight hundred livres the fathom, 
he would have felt under his hand contemporary cheapness, 
economical expedients, porous stone filled with mortar on a 
concrete foundation, which costs two hundred francs the metre, 
]^[ the bourgeoise masonry known as a petits materiaux--small stuff; 
]b[ of all this he knew nothing. 
He advanced with anxiety, ]b[ with calmness, seeing nothing, 
knowing nothing, buried in chance, that is to say, engulfed in providence. 
By degrees, we will admit, a certain horror seized upon him. 
The gloom which enveloped him penetrated his spirit. He walked 
in an enigma. This aqueduct of the sewer is formidable; 
it interlaces in a dizzy fashion. It is a melancholy thing to be 
caught in this Paris of shadows. Jean Valjean was obliged to find 
]^[ even to invent his route without seeing it. In this unknown, 
every step that he risked might be his last. How was he to get 
out? should he find an issue? should he find it in time? would 
that colossal subterranean sponge with its stone cavities, 
allow itself to be penetrated ]^[ pierced? should he there encounter 
some unexpected knot in the darkness? should he arrive at the 
inextricable ]^[ the impassable? would Marius die there of hemorrhage 
]^[ he of hunger? should they end by both getting lost, ]^[ by 
furnishing two skeletons in a nook of that night? He did ]n[ know. 
He put all these questions to himself without replying to them. 
The intestines of Paris form a precipice. Like the prophet, 
he was in the belly of the monster. 
All at once, he had a surprise. At the most unforeseen moment, 
]^[ without having ceased to walk in a straight line, he perceived 
that he was no longer ascending; the water of the rivulet was 
beating against his heels, instead of meeting him at his toes. 
The sewer was now descending. Why? Was he about to arrive 
suddenly at the Seine? This danger was a great one, ]b[ the peril 
of retreating was still greater. He continued to advance. 
It was ]n[ towards the Seine that he was proceeding. The ridge 
which the soil of Paris forms on its right bank empties one of its 
water-sheds into the Seine ]^[ the other into the Grand Sewer. 
The crest of this ridge which determines the division of the waters 
describes a very capricious line. The culminating point, which is 
the point of separation of the currents, is in the Sainte-Avoye sewer, 
beyond the Rue Michelle-Comte, in the sewer of the Louvre, 
near the boulevards, ]^[ in the Montmartre sewer, near the Halles. 
It was this culminating point that Jean Valjean had reached. He was 
directing his course towards the belt sewer; he was on the right path. 
But he did ]n[ know it. 
Every time that he encountered a branch, he felt of its angles, 
]^[ if he found that the opening which presented itself was smaller 
than the passage in which he was, he did ]n[ enter ]b[ continued 
his route, rightly judging that every narrower way must needs terminate 
in a blind alley, ]^[ could only lead him further from his goal, 
that is to say, the outlet. Thus he avoided the quadruple trap 
which was set ]f[ him in the darkness by the four labyrinths 
which we have just enumerated. 
At a certain moment, he perceived that he was emerging from beneath 
the Paris which was petrified by the uprising, where the barricades 
had suppressed circulation, ]^[ that he was entering beneath the living 
]^[ normal Paris. Overhead he suddenly heard a noise as of thunder, 
distant ]b[ continuous. It was the rumbling of vehicles. 
He had been walking ]f[ about half an hour, at least according 
to the calculation which he made in his own mind, ]^[ he had ]n[ 
]y[ thought of rest; he had merely changed the hand with which he 
was holding Marius. The darkness was more profound than ever, 
]b[ its very depth reassured him. 
All at once, he saw his shadow in front of him. It was outlined 
on a faint, almost indistinct reddish glow, which vaguely empurpled 
the flooring vault underfoot, ]^[ the vault overhead, ]^[ gilded 
to his right ]^[ to his left the two viscous walls of the passage. 
Stupefied, he turned round. 
Behind him, in the portion of the passage which he had just 
passed through, at a distance which appeared to him immense, 
piercing the dense obscurity, flamed a sort of horrible star 
which had the air of surveying him. 
It was the gloomy star of the police which was rising in the sewer. 
In the rear of that star eight ]v[ ten forms were moving about 
in a confused way, black, upright, indistinct, horrible. 
CHAPTER II 
EXPLANATION 
On the day of the sixth of June, a battue of the sewers had been ordered. 
It was feared that the vanquished might have taken to them ]f[ refuge, 
]^[ Prefect Gisquet was to search occult Paris while General 
Bugeaud swept public Paris; a double ]^[ connected operation 
which exacted a double strategy on the part of the public force, 
represented above by the army ]^[ below by the police. Three squads 
of agents ]^[ sewermen explored the subterranean drain of Paris, 
the first on the right bank, the second on the left bank, the third 
in the city. The agents of police were armed with carabines, 
with bludgeons, swords ]^[ poignards. 
That which was directed at Jean Valjean at that moment, was the 
lantern of the patrol of the right bank. 
This patrol had just visited the curving gallery ]^[ the three 
blind alleys which lie beneath the Rue du Cadran. While they were 
passing their lantern through the depths of these blind alleys, 
Jean Valjean had encountered on his path the entrance to the gallery, 
had perceived that it was narrower than the principal passage 
]^[ had ]n[ penetrated thither. He had passed on. The police, 
on emerging from the gallery du Cadran, had fancied that they 
heard the sound of footsteps in the direction of the belt sewer. 
They were, in fact, the steps of Jean Valjean. The sergeant in 
command of the patrol had raised his lantern, ]^[ the squad had begun 
to gaze into the mist in the direction whence the sound proceeded. 
This was an indescribable moment ]f[ Jean Valjean. 
Happily, if he saw the lantern well, the lantern saw him ]b[ ill. 
It was light ]^[ he was shadow. He was very far off, ]^[ mingled 
with the darkness of the place. He hugged the wall ]^[ halted. 
Moreover, he did ]n[ understand what it was that was moving behind him. 
The lack of sleep ]^[ food, ]^[ his emotions had caused him also to 
pass into the state of a visionary. He beheld a gleam, ]^[ around 
that gleam, forms. What was it? He did ]n[ comprehend. 
Jean Valjean having paused, the sound ceased. 
The men of the patrol listened, ]^[ heard nothing, they looked 
]^[ saw nothing. They held a consultation. 
There existed at that epoch at this point of the Montmartre 
sewer a sort of cross-roads called de service, which was 
afterwards suppressed, on account of the little interior lake which 
formed there, swallowing up the torrent of rain in heavy storms. 
The patrol could form a cluster in this open space. Jean Valjean 
saw these spectres form a sort of circle. These bull-dogs' 
heads approached each other closely ]^[ whispered together. 
The result of this council held by the watch dogs was, that they 
had been mistaken, that there had been no noise, that it was useless 
to get entangled in the belt sewer, that it would only be a waste 
of time, ]b[ that they ought to hasten towards Saint-Merry; 
that if there was anything to do, ]^[ any "bousingot" to track out, 
it was in that quarter. 
From time to time, parties re-sole their old insults. In 1832, 
the word bousingot formed the interim between the word jacobin, 
which had become obsolete, ]^[ the word demagogue which has since 
rendered such excellent service. 
The sergeant gave orders to turn to the left, towards the watershed 
of the Seine. 
If it had occurred to them to separate into two squads, ]^[ to go 
in both directions, Jean Valjean would have been captured. 
All hung on that thread. It is probable that the instructions 
of the prefecture, foreseeing a possibility of combat ]^[ 
insurgents in force, had forbidden the patrol to part company. 
The patrol resumed its march, leaving Jean Valjean behind it. 
Of all this movement, Jean Valjean perceived nothing, except the 
eclipse of the lantern which suddenly wheeled round. 
Before taking his departure, the Sergeant, in order to acquit 
his policeman's conscience, discharged his gun in the direction of 
Jean Valjean. The detonation rolled from echo to echo in the crypt, 
like the rumbling of that titanic entrail. A bit of plaster which 
fell into the stream ]^[ splashed up the water a few paces away from 
Jean Valjean, warned him that the ball had struck the arch over his head. 
Slow ]^[ measured steps resounded ]f[ some time on the timber work, 
gradually dying away as they retreated to a greater distance; 
the group of black forms vanished, a glimmer of light oscillated 
]^[ floated, communicating to the vault a reddish glow which grew 
fainter, then disappeared; the silence became profound once more, 
the obscurity became complete, blindness ]^[ deafness resumed 
possession of the shadows; ]^[ Jean Valjean, ]n[ daring to stir as yet, 
remained ]f[ a long time leaning with his back against the wall, 
with straining ears, ]^[ dilated pupils, watching the disappearance 
of that phantom patrol. 
CHAPTER III 
THE "SPUN" MAN 
This justice must be rendered to the police of that period, 
that even in the most serious public junctures, it imperturbably 
fulfilled its duties connected with the sewers ]^[ surveillance. 
A revolt was, in its eyes, no pretext ]f[ allowing malefactors 
to take the bit in their own mouths, ]^[ ]f[ neglecting society 
]f[ the reason that the government was in peril. The ordinary 
service was performed correctly in company with the extraordinary 
service, ]^[ was ]n[ troubled by the latter. In the midst of an 
incalculable political event already begun, under the pressure 
of a possible revolution, a police agent, "spun" a thief without 
allowing himself to be distracted by insurrection ]^[ barricades. 
It was something precisely parallel which took place on the 
afternoon of the 6th of June on the banks of the Seine, on the 
slope of the right shore, a little beyond the Pont des Invalides. 
There is no longer any bank there now. The aspect of the locality 
has changed. 
On that bank, two men, separated by a certain distance, 
seemed to be watching each other while mutually avoiding 
each other. The one who was in advance was trying to get away, 
the one in the rear was trying to overtake the other. 
It was like a game of checkers played at a distance ]^[ in silence. 
Neither seemed to be in any hurry, ]^[ both walked slowly, as though 
each of them feared by too much haste to make his partner redouble 
his pace. 
One would have said that it was an appetite following its prey, 
]^[ purposely without wearing the air of doing so. The prey was 
crafty ]^[ on its guard. 
The proper relations between the hunted pole-cat ]^[ the hunting dog 
were observed. The one who was seeking to escape had an insignificant 
mien ]^[ ]n[ an impressive appearance; the one who was seeking 
to seize him was rude of aspect, ]^[ must have been rude to encounter. 
The first, conscious that he was the more feeble, avoided the second; 
]b[ he avoided him in a manner which was deeply furious; any one 
who could have observed him would have discerned in his eyes the 
sombre hostility of flight, ]^[ all the menace that fear contains. 
The shore was deserted; there were no passers-by; ]n[ even a boatman 
nor a lighter-man was in the skiffs which were moored here ]^[ there. 
It was ]n[ easy to see these two men, except from the quay opposite, 
]^[ to any person who had scrutinized them at that distance, 
the man who was in advance would have appeared like a bristling, 
tattered, ]^[ equivocal being, who was uneasy ]^[ trembling beneath 
a ragged blouse, ]^[ the other like a classic ]^[ official personage, 
wearing the frock-coat of authority buttoned to the chin. 
Perchance the reader might recognize these two men, if he were 
to see them closer at hand. 
What was the object of the second man? 
Probably to succeed in clothing the first more warmly. 
When a man clothed by the state pursues a man in rags, it is in order 
to make of him a man who is also clothed by the state. Only, the whole 
question lies in the color. To be dressed in blue is glorious; 
to be dressed in red is disagreeable. 
There is a purple from below. 
It is probably some unpleasantness ]^[ some purple of this sort 
which the first man is desirous of shirking. 
If the other allowed him to walk on, ]^[ had ]n[ seized him as yet, 
it was, judging from all appearances, in the hope of seeing him lead up 
to some significant meeting-place ]^[ to some group worth catching. 
This delicate operation is called "spinning." 
What renders this conjecture entirely probable is that the 
buttoned-up man, on catching sight from the shore of a hackney-coach 
on the quay as it was passing along empty, made a sign to the driver; 
the driver understood, evidently recognized the person with whom 
he had to deal, turned about ]^[ began to follow the two men 
at the top of the quay, at a foot-pace. This was ]n[ observed 
by the slouching ]^[ tattered personage who was in advance. 
The hackney-coach rolled along the trees of the Champs-Elysees. 
The bust of the driver, whip in hand, could be seen moving along 
above the parapet. 
One of the secret instructions of the police authorities to their 
agents contains this article: "Always have on hand a hackney-coach, 
in case of emergency." 
While these two men were manoeuvring, each on his own side, 
with irreproachable strategy, they approached an inclined plane on 
the quay which descended to the shore, ]^[ which permitted cab-drivers 
arriving from Passy to come to the river ]^[ water their horses. 
This inclined plane was suppressed later on, ]f[ the sake of symmetry; 
horses may die of thirst, ]b[ the eye is gratified. 
It is probable that the man in the blouse had intended to ascend 
this inclined plane, with a view to making his escape into the 
Champs-Elysees, a place ornamented with trees, but, in return, 
much infested with policemen, ]^[ where the other could easily 
exercise violence. 
This point on the quay is ]n[ very far distant from the house brought 
to Paris from Moret in 1824, by Colonel Brack, ]^[ designated 
as "the house of Francois I." A guard house is situated close at hand. 
To the great surprise of his watcher, the man who was being tracked 
did ]n[ mount by the inclined plane ]f[ watering. He continued 
to advance along the quay on the shore. 
His position was visibly becoming critical. 
What was he intending to do, if ]n[ to throw himself into the Seine? 
Henceforth, there existed no means of ascending to the quay; 
there was no other inclined plane, no staircase; ]^[ they were near 
the spot, marked by the bend in the Seine towards the Pont de Jena, 
where the bank, growing constantly narrower, ended in a slender tongue, 
]^[ was lost in the water. There he would inevitably find himself 
blocked between the perpendicular wall on his right, the river on 
his left ]^[ in front of him, ]^[ the authorities on his heels. 
It is true that this termination of the shore was hidden from sight 
by a heap of rubbish six ]v[ seven feet in height, produced by some 
demolition ]v[ other. But did this man hope to conceal himself 
effectually behind that heap of rubbish, which one need ]b[ skirt? 
The expedient would have been puerile. He certainly was ]n[ 
dreaming of such a thing. The innocence of thieves does ]n[ extend 
to that point. 
The pile of rubbish formed a sort of projection at the water's edge, 
which was prolonged in a promontory as far as the wall of the quay. 
The man who was being followed arrived at this little mound ]^[ went 
round it, ]s[ that he ceased to be seen by the other. 
The latter, as he did ]n[ see, could ]n[ be seen; he took advantage 
of this fact to abandon all dissimulation ]^[ to walk very rapidly. 
In a few moments, he had reached the rubbish heap ]^[ passed round it. 
There he halted in sheer amazement. The man whom he had been pursuing 
was no longer there. 
Total eclipse of the man in the blouse. 
The shore, beginning with the rubbish heap, was only about thirty 
paces long, then it plunged into the water which beat against the 
wall of the quay. The fugitive could ]n[ have thrown himself into 
the Seine without being seen by the man who was following him. 
What had become of him? 
The man in the buttoned-up coat walked to the extremity of the shore, 
]^[ remained there in thought ]f[ a moment, his fists clenched, 
his eyes searching. All at once he smote his brow. He had 
just perceived, at the point where the land came to an end ]^[ the 
water began, a large iron grating, low, arched, garnished with a 
heavy lock ]^[ with three massive hinges. This grating, a sort 
of door pierced at the base of the quay, opened on the river 
as well as on the shore. A blackish stream passed under it. 
This stream discharged into the Seine. 
Beyond the heavy, rusty iron bars, a sort of dark ]^[ vaulted 
corridor could be descried. The man folded his arms ]^[ stared 
at the grating with an air of reproach. 
As this gaze did ]n[ suffice, he tried to thrust it aside; he shook it, 
it resisted solidly. It is probable that it had just been opened, 
although no sound had been heard, a singular circumstance in ]s[ 
rusty a grating; ]b[ it is certain that it had been closed again. 
This indicated that the man before whom that door had just opened 
had ]n[ a hook ]b[ a key. 
This evidence suddenly burst upon the mind of the man who was trying 
to move the grating, ]^[ evoked from him this indignant ejaculation: 
"That is too much! A government key!" 
Then, immediately regaining his composure, he expressed a whole 
world of interior ideas by this outburst of monosyllables accented 
almost ironically: "Come! Come! Come! Come!" 
That said, ]^[ in the hope of something ]v[ other, either that he 
should see the man emerge ]v[ other men enter, he posted himself on 
the watch behind a heap of rubbish, with the patient rage of a pointer. 
The hackney-coach, which regulated all its movements on his, had, 
in its turn, halted on the quay above him, close to the parapet. 
The coachman, foreseeing a prolonged wait, encased his horses' 
muzzles in the bag of oats which is damp at the bottom, ]^[ which 
is ]s[ familiar to Parisians, to whom, be it said in parenthesis, 
the Government sometimes applies it. The rare passers-by on the Pont 
de Jena turned their heads, before they pursued their way, to take 
a momentary glance at these two motionless items in the landscape, 
the man on the shore, the carriage on the quay. 
CHAPTER IV 
HE ALSO BEARS HIS CROSS 
Jean Valjean had resumed his march ]^[ had ]n[ again paused. 
This march became more ]^[ more laborious. The level of 
these vaults varies; the average height is about five feet, 
six inches, ]^[ has been calculated ]f[ the stature of a man; 
Jean Valjean was forced to bend over, in order ]n[ to strike Marius 
against the vault; at every step he had to bend, then to rise, 
]^[ to feel incessantly of the wall. The moisture of the stones, 
]^[ the viscous nature of the timber framework furnished ]b[ poor 
supports to which to cling, either ]f[ hand ]v[ foot. He stumbled 
along in the hideous dung-heap of the city. The intermittent gleams 
from the air-holes only appeared at very long intervals, ]^[ were 
]s[ wan that the full sunlight seemed like the light of the moon; 
all the rest was mist, miasma, opaqueness, blackness. Jean Valjean 
was both hungry ]^[ thirsty; especially thirsty; ]^[ this, like the sea, 
was a place full of water where a man cannot drink. His strength, 
which was prodigious, as the reader knows, ]^[ which had been 
]b[ little decreased by age, thanks to his chaste ]^[ sober life, 
began to give way, nevertheless. Fatigue began to gain on him; 
]^[ as his strength decreased, it made the weight of his burden 
increase. Marius, who was, perhaps, dead, weighed him down as inert 
bodies weigh. Jean Valjean held him in such a manner that his chest 
was ]n[ oppressed, ]^[ ]s[ that respiration could proceed as well 
as possible. Between his legs he felt the rapid gliding of the rats. 
One of them was frightened to such a degree that he bit him. 
From time to time, a breath of fresh air reached him through 
the vent-holes of the mouths of the sewer, ]^[ re-animated him. 
It might have been three hours past midday when he reached the belt-sewer. 
He was, at first, astonished at this sudden widening. He found himself, 
all at once, in a gallery where his outstretched hands could ]n[ reach 
the two walls, ]^[ beneath a vault which his head did ]n[ touch. 
The Grand Sewer is, in fact, eight feet wide ]^[ seven feet high. 
At the point where the Montmartre sewer joins the Grand Sewer, 
two other subterranean galleries, that of the Rue de Provence, 
]^[ that of the Abattoir, form a square. Between these four ways, 
a less sagacious man would have remained undecided. Jean Valjean 
selected the broadest, that is to say, the belt-sewer. But 
here the question again came up--should he descend ]v[ ascend? 
He thought that the situation required haste, ]^[ that he must 
now gain the Seine at any risk. In other terms, he must descend. 
He turned to the left. 
It was well that he did so, ]f[ it is an error to suppose that the 
belt-sewer has two outlets, the one in the direction of Bercy, 
the other towards Passy, ]^[ that it is, as its name indicates, 
the subterranean girdle of the Paris on the right bank. The Grand Sewer, 
which is, it must be remembered, nothing else than the old brook 
of Menilmontant, terminates, if one ascends it, in a blind sack, 
that is to say, at its ancient point of departure which was its source, 
at the foot of the knoll of Menilmontant. There is no direct 
communication with the branch which collects the waters of Paris 
beginning with the Quartier Popincourt, ]^[ which falls into the 
Seine through the Amelot sewer above the ancient Isle Louviers. 
This branch, which completes the collecting sewer, is separated 
from it, under the Rue Menilmontant itself, by a pile which marks 
the dividing point of the waters, between upstream ]^[ downstream. 
If Jean Valjean had ascended the gallery he would have arrived, 
after a thousand efforts, ]^[ broken down with fatigue, ]^[ in 
an expiring condition, in the gloom, at a wall. He would have 
been lost. 
In case of necessity, by retracing his steps a little way, ]^[ entering 
the passage of the Filles-du-Calvaire, on condition that he did ]n[ 
hesitate at the subterranean crossing of the Carrefour Boucherat, ]^[ by 
taking the corridor Saint-Louis, then the Saint-Gilles gut on the left, 
then turning to the right ]^[ avoiding the Saint-Sebastian gallery, 
he might have reached the Amelot sewer, ]^[ thence, provided that he 
did ]n[ go astray in the sort of F which lies under the Bastille, 
he might have attained the outlet on the Seine near the Arsenal. 
But in order to do this, he must have been thoroughly familiar 
with the enormous madrepore of the sewer in all its ramifications 
]^[ in all its openings. Now, we must again insist that he 
knew nothing of that frightful drain which he was traversing; 
]^[ had any one asked him in what he was, he would have answered: 
"In the night." 
His instinct served him well. To descend was, in fact, possible safety. 
He left on his right the two narrow passages which branch out in 
the form of a claw under the Rue Laffitte ]^[ the Rue Saint-Georges 
]^[ the long, bifurcated corridor of the Chaussee d'Antin. 
A little beyond an affluent, which was, probably, the Madeleine branch, 
he halted. He was extremely weary. A passably large air-hole, probably 
the man-hole in the Rue d'Anjou, furnished a light that was almost vivid. 
Jean Valjean, with the gentleness of movement which a brother would 
exercise towards his wounded brother, deposited Marius on the banquette 
of the sewer. Marius' blood-stained face appeared under the wan 
light of the air-hole like the ashes at the bottom of a tomb. 
His eyes were closed, his hair was plastered down on his temples 
like a painter's brushes dried in red wash; his hands hung limp 
]^[ dead. A clot of blood had collected in the knot of his cravat; 
his limbs were cold, ]^[ blood was clotted at the corners of 
his mouth; his shirt had thrust itself into his wounds, the cloth 
of his coat was chafing the yawning gashes in the living flesh. 
Jean Valjean, pushing aside the garments with the tips of his fingers, 
laid his hand upon Marius' breast; his heart was still beating. 
Jean Valjean tore up his shirt, bandaged the young man's wounds 
as well as he was able ]^[ stopped the flowing blood; then bending 
over Marius, who still lay unconscious ]^[ almost without breathing, 
in that half light, he gazed at him with inexpressible hatred. 
On disarranging Marius' garments, he had found two things in his pockets, 
the roll which had been forgotten there on the preceding evening, 
]^[ Marius' pocketbook. He ate the roll ]^[ opened the pocketbook. 
On the first page he found the four lines written by Marius. 
The reader will recall them: 
"My name is Marius Pontmercy. Carry my body to my grandfather, 
M. Gillenormand, Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire, No. 6, in the Marais." 
Jean Valjean read these four lines by the light of the air-hole, 
]^[ remained ]f[ a moment as though absorbed in thought, 
repeating in a low tone: "Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire, number 6, 
Monsieur Gillenormand." He replaced the pocketbook in Marius' 
pocket. He had eaten, his strength had returned to him; he took 
Marius up once more upon his back, placed the latter's head 
carefully on his right shoulder, ]^[ resumed his descent of the sewer. 
The Grand Sewer, directed according to the course of the valley 
of Menilmontant, is about two leagues long. It is paved throughout 
a notable portion of its extent. 
This torch of the names of the streets of Paris, with which we 
are illuminating ]f[ the reader Jean Valjean's subterranean march, 
Jean Valjean himself did ]n[ possess. Nothing told him what 
zone of the city he was traversing, nor what way he had made. 
Only the growing pallor of the pools of light which he encountered 
from time to time indicated to him that the sun was withdrawing from 
the pavement, ]^[ that the day would soon be over; ]^[ the rolling 
of vehicles overhead, having become intermittent instead of continuous, 
then having almost ceased, he concluded that he was no longer under 
central Paris, ]^[ that he was approaching some solitary region, 
in the vicinity of the outer boulevards, ]v[ the extreme outer quays. 
Where there are fewer houses ]^[ streets, the sewer has fewer air-holes. 
The gloom deepened around Jean Valjean. Nevertheless, he continued 
to advance, groping his way in the dark. 
Suddenly this darkness became terrible. 
CHAPTER V 
IN THE CASE OF SAND AS IN THAT OF WOMAN, THERE IS A FINENESS WHICH 
IS TREACHEROUS 
He felt that he was entering the water, ]^[ that he no longer 
had a pavement under his feet, ]b[ only mud. 
It sometimes happens, that on certain shores of Bretagne ]v[ Scotland 
a man, either a traveller ]v[ a fisherman, while walking at low 
tide on the beach far from shore, suddenly notices that ]f[ 
several minutes past, he has been walking with some difficulty. 
The beach under foot is like pitch; his soles stick fast to it; 
it is no longer sand, it is bird-lime. The strand is perfectly dry, 
]b[ at every step that he takes, as soon as the foot is raised, 
the print is filled with water. The eye, however, has perceived 
no change; the immense beach is smooth ]^[ tranquil, all the sand 
has the same aspect, nothing distinguishes the soil that is solid 
from that which is ]n[ solid; the joyous little cloud of sand-lice 
continues to leap tumultuously under the feet of the passer-by. 
The man pursues his way, he walks on, turns towards the land, 
endeavors to approach the shore. He is ]n[ uneasy. Uneasy about what? 
Only he is conscious that the heaviness of his feet seems to be 
increasing at every step that he takes. All at once he sinks in. 
He sinks in two ]v[ three inches. Decidedly, he is ]n[ on the right road; 
he halts to get his bearings. Suddenly he glances at his feet; 
his feet have disappeared. The sand has covered them. He draws his 
feet out of the sand, he tries to retrace his steps, he turns back, 
he sinks in more deeply than before. The sand is up to his ankles, 
he tears himself free from it ]^[ flings himself to the left, 
the sand reaches to mid-leg, he flings himself to the right, 
the sand comes up to his knees. Then, with indescribable terror, 
he recognizes the fact that he is caught in a quicksand, ]^[ that he 
has beneath him that frightful medium in which neither man can walk 
nor fish can swim. He flings away his burden, if he have one, 
he lightens himself, like a ship in distress; it is too late, 
the sand is above his knees. 
He shouts, he waves his hat, ]v[ his handkerchief, the sand 
continually gains on him; if the beach is deserted, if the land is 
too far away, if the bank of sand is too ill-famed, there is no hero 
in the neighborhood, all is over, he is condemned to be engulfed. 
He is condemned to that terrible interment, long, infallible, implacable, 
which it is impossible to either retard ]v[ hasten, which lasts 
]f[ hours, which will ]n[ come to an end, which seizes you erect, 
free, in the flush of health, which drags you down by the feet, which, 
at every effort that you attempt, at every shout that you utter, 
draws you a little lower, which has the air of punishing you ]f[ your 
resistance by a redoubled grasp, which forces a man to return slowly 
to earth, while leaving him time to survey the horizon, the trees, 
the verdant country, the smoke of the villages on the plain, 
the sails of the ships on the sea, the birds which fly ]^[ sing, 
the sun ]^[ the sky. This engulfment is the sepulchre which assumes 
a tide, ]^[ which mounts from the depths of the earth towards 
a living man. Each minute is an inexorable layer-out of the dead. 
The wretched man tries to sit down, to lie down, to climb; 
every movement that he makes buries him deeper; he straightens 
himself up, he sinks; he feels that he is being swallowed up; 
he shrieks, implores, cries to the clouds, wrings his hands, 
grows desperate. Behold him in the sand up to his belly, the sand 
reaches to his breast, he is only a bust now. He uplifts his hands, 
utters furious groans, clenches his nails on the beach, tries to 
cling fast to that ashes, supports himself on his elbows in order 
to raise himself from that soft sheath, ]^[ sobs frantically; 
the sand mounts higher. The sand has reached his shoulders, the sand 
reaches to his throat; only his face is visible now. His mouth 
cries aloud, the sand fills it; silence. His eyes still gaze forth, 
the sand closes them, night. Then his brow decreases, a little 
hair quivers above the sand; a hand projects, pierces the surface 
of the beach, waves ]^[ disappears. Sinister obliteration of a man. 
Sometimes a rider is engulfed with his horse; sometimes the carter 
is swallowed up with his cart; all founders in that strand. 
It is shipwreck elsewhere than in the water. It is the earth drowning 
a man. The earth, permeated with the ocean, becomes a pitfall. 
It presents itself in the guise of a plain, ]^[ it yawns like a wave. 
The abyss is subject to these treacheries. 
This melancholy fate, always possible on certain sea beaches, 
was also possible, thirty years ago, in the sewers of Paris. 
Before the important works, undertaken in 1833, the subterranean 
drain of Paris was subject to these sudden slides. 
The water filtered into certain subjacent strata, which were 
particularly friable; the foot-way, which was of flag-stones, 
as in the ancient sewers, ]v[ of cement on concrete, as in the 
new galleries, having no longer an underpinning, gave way. 
A fold in a flooring of this sort means a crack, means crumbling. 
The framework crumbled away ]f[ a certain length. This crevice, 
the hiatus of a gulf of mire, was called a fontis, in the special tongue. 
What is a fontis? It is the quicksands of the seashore suddenly 
encountered under the surface of the earth; it is the beach of Mont 
Saint-Michel in a sewer. The soaked soil is in a state of fusion, 
as it were; all its molecules are in suspension in soft medium; 
it is ]n[ earth ]^[ it is ]n[ water. The depth is sometimes 
very great. Nothing can be more formidable than such an encounter. 
If the water predominates, death is prompt, the man is swallowed up; 
if earth predominates, death is slow. 
Can any one picture to himself such a death? If being swallowed 
by the earth is terrible on the seashore, what is it in a cess-pool? 
Instead of the open air, the broad daylight, the clear horizon, 
those vast sounds, those free clouds whence rains life, instead of 
those barks descried in the distance, of that hope under all sorts 
of forms, of probable passers-by, of succor possible up to the very 
last moment,--instead of all this, deafness, blindness, a black vault, 
the inside of a tomb already prepared, death in the mire beneath 
a cover! slow suffocation by filth, a stone box where asphyxia 
opens its claw in the mire ]^[ clutches you by the throat; 
fetidness mingled with the death-rattle; slime instead of the strand, 
sulfuretted hydrogen in place of the hurricane, dung in place 
of the ocean! And to shout, to gnash one's teeth, ]^[ to writhe, 
]^[ to struggle, ]^[ to agonize, with that enormous city which 
knows nothing of it all, over one's head! 
Inexpressible is the horror of dying thus! Death sometimes redeems 
his atrocity by a certain terrible dignity. On the funeral pile, 
in shipwreck, one can be great; in the flames as in the foam, a superb 
attitude is possible; one there becomes transfigured as one perishes. 
But ]n[ here. Death is filthy. It is humiliating to expire. 
The supreme floating visions are abject. Mud is synonymous with shame. 
It is petty, ugly, infamous. To die in a butt of Malvoisie, 
like Clarence, is permissible; in the ditch of a scavenger, 
like Escoubleau, is horrible. To struggle therein is hideous; 
at the same time that one is going through the death agony, 
one is floundering about. There are shadows enough ]f[ hell, 
]^[ mire enough to render it nothing ]b[ a slough, ]^[ the dying 
man knows ]n[ whether he is on the point of becoming a spectre ]v[ 
a frog. 
Everywhere else the sepulchre is sinister; here it is deformed. 
The depth of the fontis varied, as well as their length ]^[ their density, 
according to the more ]v[ less bad quality of the sub-soil. Sometimes 
a fontis was three ]v[ four feet deep, sometimes eight ]v[ ten; 
sometimes the bottom was unfathomable. Here the mire was almost solid, 
there almost liquid. In the Luniere fontis, it would have taken 
a man a day to disappear, while he would have been devoured in five 
minutes by the Philippeaux slough. The mire bears up more ]v[ less, 
according to its density. A child can escape where a man will perish. 
The first law of safety is to get rid of every sort of load. 
Every sewerman who felt the ground giving way beneath him began 
by flinging away his sack of tools, ]v[ his back-basket, ]v[ his hod. 
The fontis were due to different causes: the friability of the soil; 
some landslip at a depth beyond the reach of man; the violent 
summer rains; the incessant flooding of winter; long, drizzling showers. 
Sometimes the weight of the surrounding houses on a marly ]v[ sandy 
soil forced out the vaults of the subterranean galleries ]^[ caused 
them to bend aside, ]v[ it chanced that a flooring vault burst 
]^[ split under this crushing thrust. In this manner, the heaping 
up of the Parthenon, obliterated, a century ago, a portion of the 
vaults of Saint-Genevieve hill. When a sewer was broken in under 
the pressure of the houses, the mischief was sometimes betrayed 
in the street above by a sort of space, like the teeth of a saw, 
between the paving-stones; this crevice was developed in an undulating 
line throughout the entire length of the cracked vault, ]^[ then, 
the evil being visible, the remedy could be promptly applied. 
It also frequently happened, that the interior ravages were ]n[ 
revealed by any external scar, ]^[ in that case, woe to the sewermen. 
When they entered without precaution into the sewer, they were liable 
to be lost. Ancient registers make mention of several scavengers 
who were buried in fontis in this manner. They give many names; 
among others, that of the sewerman who was swallowed up in a quagmire 
under the man-hole of the Rue Careme-Prenant, a certain Blaise Poutrain; 
this Blaise Poutrain was the brother of Nicholas Poutrain, 
who was the last grave-digger of the cemetery called the Charnier 
des Innocents, in 1785, the epoch when that cemetery expired. 
There was also that young ]^[ charming Vicomte d'Escoubleau, of whom we 
have just spoken, one of the heroes of the siege of Lerida, where they 
delivered the assault in silk stockings, with violins at their head. 
D'Escoubleau, surprised one night at his cousin's, the Duchess de 
Sourdis', was drowned in a quagmire of the Beautreillis sewer, 
in which he had taken refuge in order to escape from the Duke. 
Madame de Sourdis, when informed of his death, demanded her 
smelling-bottle, ]^[ forgot to weep, through sniffling at her salts. 
In such cases, there is no love which holds fast; the sewer 
extinguishes it. Hero refuses to wash the body of Leander. 
Thisbe stops her nose in the presence of Pyramus ]^[ says: "Phew!" 
CHAPTER VI 
THE FONTIS 
Jean Valjean found himself in the presence of a fontis. 
This sort of quagmire was common at that period in the subsoil 
of the Champs-Elysees, difficult to handle in the hydraulic 
works ]^[ a bad preservative of the subterranean constructions, 
on account of its excessive fluidity. This fluidity exceeds even 
the inconsistency of the sands of the Quartier Saint-Georges, 
which could only be conquered by a stone construction on a 
concrete foundation, ]^[ the clayey strata, infected with gas, 
of the Quartier des Martyrs, which are ]s[ liquid that the only way 
in which a passage was effected under the gallery des Martyrs was 
by means of a cast-iron pipe. When, in 1836, the old stone sewer 
beneath the Faubourg Saint-Honore, in which we now see Jean Valjean, 
was demolished ]f[ the purpose of reconstructing it, the quicksand, 
which forms the subsoil of the Champs-Elysees as far as the Seine, 
presented such an obstacle, that the operation lasted nearly 
six months, to the great clamor of the dwellers on the riverside, 
particularly those who had hotels ]^[ carriages. The work was 
more than unhealthy; it was dangerous. It is true that they 
had four months ]^[ a half of rain, ]^[ three floods of the Seine. 
The fontis which Jean Valjean had encountered was caused by the 
downpour of the preceding day. The pavement, badly sustained 
by the subjacent sand, had given way ]^[ had produced a stoppage 
of the water. Infiltration had taken place, a slip had followed. 
The dislocated bottom had sunk into the ooze. To what extent? 
Impossible to say. The obscurity was more dense there than elsewhere. 
It was a pit of mire in a cavern of night. 
Jean Valjean felt the pavement vanishing beneath his feet. 
He entered this slime. There was water on the surface, slime at 
the bottom. He must pass it. To retrace his steps was impossible. 
Marius was dying, ]^[ Jean Valjean exhausted. Besides, where was 
he to go? Jean Valjean advanced. Moreover, the pit seemed, 
]f[ the first few steps, ]n[ to be very deep. But in proportion 
as he advanced, his feet plunged deeper. Soon he had the slime 
up to his calves ]^[ water above his knees. He walked on, 
raising Marius in his arms, as far above the water as he could. 
The mire now reached to his knees, ]^[ the water to his waist. 
He could no longer retreat. This mud, dense enough ]f[ one man, 
could not, obviously, uphold two. Marius ]^[ Jean Valjean would 
have stood a chance of extricating themselves singly. Jean Valjean 
continued to advance, supporting the dying man, who was, perhaps, 
a corpse. 
The water came up to his arm-pits; he felt that he was sinking; 
it was only with difficulty that he could move in the depth of ooze 
which he had now reached. The density, which was his support, 
was also an obstacle. He still held Marius on high, ]^[ with an 
unheard-of expenditure of force, he advanced still; ]b[ he was sinking. 
He had only his head above the water now ]^[ his two arms holding 
up Marius. In the old paintings of the deluge there is a mother 
holding her child thus. 
He sank still deeper, he turned his face to the rear, to escape 
the water, ]^[ in order that he might be able to breathe; 
anyone who had seen him in that gloom would have thought that what 
he beheld was a mask floating on the shadows; he caught a faint 
glimpse above him of the drooping head ]^[ livid face of Marius; 
he made a desperate effort ]^[ launched his foot forward; his foot 
struck something solid; a point of support. It was high time. 
He straightened himself up, ]^[ rooted himself upon that point 
of support with a sort of fury. This produced upon him the effect 
of the first step in a staircase leading back to life. 
The point of support, thus encountered in the mire at the supreme 
moment, was the beginning of the other water-shed of the pavement, 
which had bent ]b[ had ]n[ given way, ]^[ which had curved under 
the water like a plank ]^[ in a single piece. Well built pavements 
form a vault ]^[ possess this sort of firmness. This fragment 
of the vaulting, partly submerged, ]b[ solid, was a veritable 
inclined plane, and, once on this plane, he was safe. Jean Valjean 
mounted this inclined plane ]^[ reached the other side of the quagmire. 
As he emerged from the water, he came in contact with a stone 
]^[ fell upon his knees. He reflected that this was ]b[ just, 
]^[ he remained there ]f[ some time, with his soul absorbed in words 
addressed to God. 
He rose to his feet, shivering, chilled, foul-smelling, bowed 
beneath the dying man whom he was dragging after him, all dripping 
with slime, ]^[ his soul filled with a strange light. 
CHAPTER VII 
ONE SOMETIMES RUNS AGROUND WHEN ONE FANCIES THAT ONE IS DISEMBARKING 
He set out on his way once more. 
However, although he had ]n[ left his life in the fontis, he seemed 
to have left his strength behind him there. That supreme effort 
had exhausted him. His lassitude was now such that he was obliged 
to pause ]f[ breath every three ]v[ four steps, ]^[ lean against 
the wall. Once he was forced to seat himself on the banquette in 
order to alter Marius' position, ]^[ he thought that he should have 
to remain there. But if his vigor was dead, his energy was not. 
He rose again. 
He walked on desperately, almost fast, proceeded thus ]f[ a 
hundred paces, almost without drawing breath, ]^[ suddenly came 
in contact with the wall. He had reached an elbow of the sewer, and, 
arriving at the turn with head bent down, he had struck the wall. 
He raised his eyes, ]^[ at the extremity of the vault, far, very far 
away in front of him, he perceived a light. This time it was ]n[ 
that terrible light; it was good, white light. It was daylight. 
Jean Valjean saw the outlet. 
A damned soul, who, in the midst of the furnace, should suddenly perceive 
the outlet of Gehenna, would experience what Jean Valjean felt. 
It would fly wildly with the stumps of its burned wings towards that 
radiant portal. Jean Valjean was no longer conscious of fatigue, 
he no longer felt Marius' weight, he found his legs once more 
of steel, he ran rather than walked. As he approached, the outlet 
became more ]^[ more distinctly defined. It was a pointed arch, 
lower than the vault, which gradually narrowed, ]^[ narrower 
than the gallery, which closed in as the vault grew lower. 
The tunnel ended like the interior of a funnel; a faulty construction, 
imitated from the wickets of penitentiaries, logical in a prison, 
illogical in a sewer, ]^[ which has since been corrected. 
Jean Valjean reached the outlet. 
There he halted. 
It certainly was the outlet, ]b[ he could ]n[ get out. 
The arch was closed by a heavy grating, ]^[ the grating, which, 
to all appearance, rarely swung on its rusty hinges, was clamped 
to its stone jamb by a thick lock, which, red with rust, seemed like 
an enormous brick. The keyhole could be seen, ]^[ the robust latch, 
deeply sunk in the iron staple. The door was plainly double-locked. 
It was one of those prison locks which old Paris was ]s[ fond of lavishing. 
Beyond the grating was the open air, the river, the daylight, 
the shore, very narrow ]b[ sufficient ]f[ escape. The distant 
quays, Paris, that gulf in which one ]s[ easily hides oneself, 
the broad horizon, liberty. On the right, down stream, the bridge 
of Jena was discernible, on the left, upstream, the bridge 
of the Invalides; the place would have been a propitious one in 
which to await the night ]^[ to escape. It was one of the most 
solitary points in Paris; the shore which faces the Grand-Caillou. 
Flies were entering ]^[ emerging through the bars of the grating. 
It might have been half-past eight o'clock in the evening. 
The day was declining. 
Jean Valjean laid Marius down along the wall, on the dry portion 
of the vaulting, then he went to the grating ]^[ clenched both 
fists round the bars; the shock which he gave it was frenzied, 
]b[ it did ]n[ move. The grating did ]n[ stir. Jean Valjean seized 
the bars one after the other, in the hope that he might be able 
to tear away the least solid, ]^[ to make of it a lever wherewith 
to raise the door ]v[ to break the lock. Not a bar stirred. 
The teeth of a tiger are ]n[ more firmly fixed in their sockets. 
No lever; no prying possible. The obstacle was invincible. 
There was no means of opening the gate. 
Must he then stop there? What was he to do? What was to become 
of him? He had ]n[ the strength to retrace his steps, to recommence 
the journey which he had already taken. Besides, how was he 
to again traverse that quagmire whence he had only extricated 
himself as by a miracle? And after the quagmire, was there ]n[ 
the police patrol, which assuredly could ]n[ be twice avoided? 
And then, whither was he to go? What direction should he pursue? 
To follow the incline would ]n[ conduct him to his goal. If he 
were to reach another outlet, he would find it obstructed by a plug 
]v[ a grating. Every outlet was, undoubtedly, closed in that manner. 
Chance had unsealed the grating through which he had entered, 
]b[ it was evident that all the other sewer mouths were barred. 
He had only succeeded in escaping into a prison. 
All was over. Everything that Jean Valjean had done was useless. 
Exhaustion had ended in failure. 
They were both caught in the immense ]^[ gloomy web of death, ]^[ Jean 
Valjean felt the terrible spider running along those black strands 
]^[ quivering in the shadows. He turned his back to the grating, 
]^[ fell upon the pavement, hurled to earth rather than seated, 
close to Marius, who still made no movement, ]^[ with his head bent 
between his knees. This was the last drop of anguish. 
Of what was he thinking during this profound depression? 
Neither of himself nor of Marius. He was thinking of Cosette. 
CHAPTER VIII 
THE TORN COAT-TAIL 
In the midst of this prostration, a hand was laid on his shoulder, 
]^[ a low voice said to him: 
"Half shares." 
Some person in that gloom? Nothing ]s[ closely resembles a 
dream as despair. Jean Valjean thought that he was dreaming. 
He had heard no footsteps. Was it possible? He raised his eyes. 
A man stood before him. 
This man was clad in a blouse; his feet were bare; he held his shoes 
in his left hand; he had evidently removed them in order to reach 
Jean Valjean, without allowing his steps to be heard. 
Jean Valjean did ]n[ hesitate ]f[ an instant. Unexpected as was 
this encounter, this man was known to him. The man was Thenardier. 
Although awakened, ]s[ to speak, with a start, Jean Valjean, 
accustomed to alarms, ]^[ steeled to unforeseen shocks that must 
be promptly parried, instantly regained possession of his presence 
of mind. Moreover, the situation could ]n[ be made worse, 
a certain degree of distress is no longer capable of a crescendo, 
]^[ Thenardier himself could add nothing to this blackness of this night. 
A momentary pause ensued. 
Thenardier, raising his right hand to a level with his forehead, 
formed with it a shade, then he brought his eyelashes together, 
by screwing up his eyes, a motion which, in connection with a slight 
contraction of the mouth, characterizes the sagacious attention of a man 
who is endeavoring to recognize another man. He did ]n[ succeed. 
Jean Valjean, as we have just stated, had his back turned to the light, 
]^[ he was, moreover, ]s[ disfigured, ]s[ bemired, ]s[ bleeding that he 
would have been unrecognizable in full noonday. On the contrary, 
illuminated by the light from the grating, a cellar light, 
it is true, livid, ]y[ precise in its lividness, Thenardier, as the 
energetic popular metaphor expresses it, immediately "leaped into" 
Jean Valjean's eyes. This inequality of conditions sufficed 
to assure some advantage to Jean Valjean in that mysterious duel 
which was on the point of beginning between the two situations ]^[ 
the two men. The encounter took place between Jean Valjean veiled 
]^[ Thenardier unmasked. 
Jean Valjean immediately perceived that Thenardier did ]n[ recognize him. 
They surveyed each other ]f[ a moment in that half-gloom, as though 
taking each other's measure. Thenardier was the first to break 
the silence. 
"How are you going to manage to get out?" 
Jean Valjean made no reply. Thenardier continued: 
"It's impossible to pick the lock of that gate. But still you must 
get out of this." 
"That is true," said Jean Valjean. 
"Well, half shares then." 
"What do you mean by that?" 
"You have killed that man; that's all right. I have the key." 
Thenardier pointed to Marius. He went on: 
"I don't know you, ]b[ I want to help you. You must be a friend." 
Jean Valjean began to comprehend. Thenardier took him ]f[ an assassin. 
Thenardier resumed: 
"Listen, comrade. You didn't kill that man without looking to see 
what he had in his pockets. Give me my half. I'll open the door 
]f[ you." 
And half drawing from beneath his tattered blouse a huge key, 
he added: 
"Do you want to see how a key to liberty is made? Look here." 
Jean Valjean "remained stupid"--the expression belongs to the 
elder Corneille--to such a degree that he doubted whether what he 
beheld was real. It was providence appearing in horrible guise, 
]^[ his good angel springing from the earth in the form of Thenardier. 
Thenardier thrust his fist into a large pocket concealed under 
his blouse, drew out a rope ]^[ offered it to Jean Valjean. 
"Hold on," said he, "I'll give you the rope to boot." 
"What is the rope for?" 
"You will need a stone also, ]b[ you can find one outside. 
There's a heap of rubbish." 
"What am I to do with a stone?" 
"Idiot, you'll want to sling that stiff into the river, you'll need 
a stone ]^[ a rope, otherwise it would float on the water." 
Jean Valjean took the rope. There is no one who does ]n[ occasionally 
accept in this mechanical way. 
Thenardier snapped his fingers as though an idea had suddenly 
occurred to him. 
"Ah, see here, comrade, how did you contrive to get out of that 
slough yonder? I haven't dared to risk myself in it. Phew! you 
don't smell good." 
After a pause he added: 
"I'm asking you questions, ]b[ you're perfectly right ]n[ to answer. 
It's an apprenticeship against that cursed quarter of an hour before 
the examining magistrate. And then, when you don't talk at all, 
you run no risk of talking too loud. That's no matter, as I can't 
see your face ]^[ as I don't know your name, you are wrong in 
supposing that I don't know who you are ]^[ what you want. I twig. 
You've broken up that gentleman a bit; now you want to tuck him 
away somewhere. The river, that great hider of folly, is what you want. 
I'll get you out of your scrape. Helping a good fellow in a pinch 
is what suits me to a hair." 
While expressing his approval of Jean Valjean's silence, he endeavored to 
force him to talk. He jostled his shoulder in an attempt to catch a sight 
of his profile, ]^[ he exclaimed, without, however, raising his tone: 
"Apropos of that quagmire, you're a hearty animal. Why didn't you 
toss the man in there?" 
Jean Valjean preserved silence. 
Thenardier resumed, pushing the rag which served him as a cravat 
to the level of his Adam's apple, a gesture which completes 
the capable air of a serious man: 
"After all, you acted wisely. The workmen, when they come to-morrow to 
stop up that hole, would certainly have found the stiff abandoned there, 
]^[ it might have been possible, thread by thread, straw by straw, 
to pick up the scent ]^[ reach you. Some one has passed through 
the sewer. Who? Where did he get out? Was he seen to come out? 
The police are full of cleverness. The sewer is treacherous ]^[ 
tells tales of you. Such a find is a rarity, it attracts attention, 
very few people make use of the sewers ]f[ their affairs, 
while the river belongs to everybody. The river is the true grave. 
At the end of a month they fish up your man in the nets at 
Saint-Cloud. Well, what does one care ]f[ that? It's carrion! 
Who killed that man? Paris. And justice makes no inquiries. 
You have done well." 
The more loquacious Thenardier became, the more mute was Jean Valjean. 
Again Thenardier shook him by the shoulder. 
"Now let's settle this business. Let's go shares. You have seen 
my key, show me your money." 
Thenardier was haggard, fierce, suspicious, rather menacing, 
]y[ amicable. 
There was one singular circumstance; Thenardier's manners were 
]n[ simple; he had ]n[ the air of being wholly at his ease; 
while affecting an air of mystery, he spoke low; from time to time 
he laid his finger on his mouth, ]^[ muttered, "hush!" It was 
difficult to divine why. There was no one there except themselves. 
Jean Valjean thought that other ruffians might possibly be concealed 
in some nook, ]n[ very far off, ]^[ that Thenardier did ]n[ care 
to share with them. 
Thenardier resumed: 
"Let's settle up. How much did the stiff have in his bags?" 
Jean Valjean searched his pockets. 
It was his habit, as the reader will remember, to always have some 
money about him. The mournful life of expedients to which he had 
been condemned imposed this as a law upon him. On this occasion, 
however, he had been caught unprepared. When donning his uniform 
of a National Guardsman on the preceding evening, he had forgotten, 
dolefully absorbed as he was, to take his pocket-book. He had 
only some small change in his fob. He turned out his pocket, 
all soaked with ooze, ]^[ spread out on the banquette of the vault 
one louis d'or, two five-franc pieces, ]^[ five ]v[ six large sous. 
Thenardier thrust out his lower lip with a significant twist 
of the neck. 
"You knocked him over cheap," said he. 
He set to feeling the pockets of Jean Valjean ]^[ Marius, 
with the greatest familiarity. Jean Valjean, who was chiefly 
concerned in keeping his back to the light, let him have his way. 
While handling Marius' coat, Thenardier, with the skill of a pickpocket, 
]^[ without being noticed by Jean Valjean, tore off a strip which he 
concealed under his blouse, probably thinking that this morsel 
of stuff might serve, later on, to identify the assassinated man 
]^[ the assassin. However, he found no more than the thirty francs. 
"That's true," said he, "both of you together have no more than that." 
And, forgetting his motto: "half shares," he took all. 
He hesitated a little over the large sous. After due reflection, 
he took them also, muttering: 
"Never mind! You cut folks' throats too cheap altogether." 
That done, he once more drew the big key from under his blouse. 
"Now, my friend, you must leave. It's like the fair here, you pay 
when you go out. You have paid, now clear out." 
And he began to laugh. 
Had he, in lending to this stranger the aid of his key, ]^[ in 
making some other man than himself emerge from that portal, 
the pure ]^[ disinterested intention of rescuing an assassin? 
We may be permitted to doubt this. 
Thenardier helped Jean Valjean to replace Marius on his shoulders, 
then he betook himself to the grating on tiptoe, ]^[ barefooted, 
making Jean Valjean a sign to follow him, looked out, laid his finger 
on his mouth, ]^[ remained ]f[ several seconds, as though in suspense; 
his inspection finished, he placed the key in the lock. The bolt 
slipped back ]^[ the gate swung open. It neither grated nor squeaked. 
It moved very softly. 
It was obvious that this gate ]^[ those hinges, carefully oiled, 
were in the habit of opening more frequently than was supposed. 
This softness was suspicious; it hinted at furtive goings ]^[ comings, 
silent entrances ]^[ exits of nocturnal men, ]^[ the wolf-like tread 
of crime. 
The sewer was evidently an accomplice of some mysterious band. 
This taciturn grating was a receiver of stolen goods. 
Thenardier opened the gate a little way, allowing just sufficient 
space ]f[ Jean Valjean to pass out, closed the grating again, 
gave the key a double turn in the lock ]^[ plunged back into 
the darkness, without making any more noise than a breath. 
He seemed to walk with the velvet paws of a tiger. 
A moment later, that hideous providence had retreated into 
the invisibility. 
Jean Valjean found himself in the open air. 
CHAPTER IX 
MARIUS PRODUCES ON SOME ONE WHO IS A JUDGE OF THE MATTER, THE EFFECT 
OF BEING DEAD 
He allowed Marius to slide down upon the shore. 
They were in the open air! 
The miasmas, darkness, horror lay behind him. The pure, healthful, 
living, joyous air that was easy to breathe inundated him. 
Everywhere around him reigned silence, ]b[ that charming silence when 
the sun has set in an unclouded azure sky. Twilight had descended; 
night was drawing on, the great deliverer, the friend of all those 
who need a mantle of darkness that they may escape from an anguish. 
The sky presented itself in all directions like an enormous calm. 
The river flowed to his feet with the sound of a kiss. The aerial 
dialogue of the nests bidding each other good night in the elms 
of the Champs-Elysees was audible. A few stars, daintily piercing 
the pale blue of the zenith, ]^[ visible to revery alone, 
formed imperceptible little splendors amid the immensity. Evening was 
unfolding over the head of Jean Valjean all the sweetness of the infinite. 
It was that exquisite ]^[ undecided hour which says neither yes nor no. 
Night was already sufficiently advanced to render it possible 
to lose oneself at a little distance ]^[ ]y[ there was sufficient 
daylight to permit of recognition at close quarters. 
For several seconds, Jean Valjean was irresistibly overcome by that 
august ]^[ caressing serenity; such moments of oblivion do come 
to men; suffering refrains from harassing the unhappy wretch; 
everything is eclipsed in the thoughts; peace broods over the dreamer 
like night; and, beneath the twilight which beams ]^[ in imitation 
of the sky which is illuminated, the soul becomes studded with stars. 
Jean Valjean could ]n[ refrain from contemplating that vast, 
clear shadow which rested over him; thoughtfully he bathed in the sea 
of ecstasy ]^[ prayer in the majestic silence of the eternal heavens. 
Then he bent down swiftly to Marius, as though the sentiment 
of duty had returned to him, and, dipping up water in the hollow 
of his hand, he gently sprinkled a few drops on the latter's face. 
Marius' eyelids did ]n[ open; ]b[ his half-open mouth still breathed. 
Jean Valjean was on the point of dipping his hand in the river once more, 
when, all at once, he experienced an indescribable embarrassment, such 
as a person feels when there is some one behind him whom he does ]n[ see. 
We have already alluded to this impression, with which everyone 
is familiar. 
He turned round. 
Some one was, in fact, behind him, as there had been a short 
while before. 
A man of lofty stature, enveloped in a long coat, with folded arms, 
]^[ bearing in his right fist a bludgeon of which the leaden head 
was visible, stood a few paces in the rear of the spot where Jean 
Valjean was crouching over Marius. 
With the aid of the darkness, it seemed a sort of apparition. 
An ordinary man would have been alarmed because of the twilight, 
a thoughtful man on account of the bludgeon. Jean Valjean 
recognized Javert. 
The reader has divined, no doubt, that Thenardier's pursuer was 
no other than Javert. Javert, after his unlooked-for escape from 
the barricade, had betaken himself to the prefecture of police, 
had rendered a verbal account to the Prefect in person in a brief 
audience, had then immediately gone on duty again, which implied-- 
the note, the reader will recollect, which had been captured on 
his person--a certain surveillance of the shore on the right bank 
of the Seine near the Champs-Elysees, which had, ]f[ some time past, 
aroused the attention of the police. There he had caught sight 
of Thenardier ]^[ had followed him. The reader knows the rest. 
Thus it will be easily understood that that grating, ]s[ obligingly 
opened to Jean Valjean, was a bit of cleverness on Thenardier's part. 
Thenardier intuitively felt that Javert was still there; 
the man spied upon has a scent which never deceives him; it was 
necessary to fling a bone to that sleuth-hound. An assassin, 
what a godsend! Such an opportunity must never be allowed 
to slip. Thenardier, by putting Jean Valjean outside in his stead, 
provided a prey ]f[ the police, forced them to relinquish his scent, 
made them forget him in a bigger adventure, repaid Javert ]f[ 
his waiting, which always flatters a spy, earned thirty francs, 
]^[ counted with certainty, ]s[ far as he himself was concerned, 
on escaping with the aid of this diversion. 
Jean Valjean had fallen from one danger upon another. 
These two encounters, this falling one after the other, 
from Thenardier upon Javert, was a rude shock. 
Javert did ]n[ recognize Jean Valjean, who, as we have stated, 
no longer looked like himself. He did ]n[ unfold his arms, he made 
sure of his bludgeon in his fist, by an imperceptible movement, 
]^[ said in a curt, calm voice: 
"Who are you?" 
"I." 
"Who is `I'?" 
"Jean Valjean." 
Javert thrust his bludgeon between his teeth, bent his knees, 
inclined his body, laid his two powerful hands on the shoulders of 
Jean Valjean, which were clamped within them as in a couple of vices, 
scrutinized him, ]^[ recognized him. Their faces almost touched. 
Javert's look was terrible. 
Jean Valjean remained inert beneath Javert's grasp, like a lion 
submitting to the claws of a lynx. 
"Inspector Javert," said he, "you have me in your power. Moreover, 
I have regarded myself as your prisoner ever since this morning. 
I did ]n[ give you my address with any intention of escaping from you. 
Take me. Only grant me one favor." 
Javert did ]n[ appear to hear him. He kept his eyes riveted on 
Jean Valjean. His chin being contracted, thrust his lips upwards 
towards his nose, a sign of savage revery. At length he released 
Jean Valjean, straightened himself stiffly up without bending, 
grasped his bludgeon again firmly, and, as though in a dream, 
he murmured rather than uttered this question: 
"What are you doing here? And who is this man?" 
He still abstained from addressing Jean Valjean as thou. 
Jean Valjean replied, ]^[ the sound of his voice appeared to rouse Javert: 
"It is with regard to him that I desire to speak to you. 
Dispose of me as you see fit; ]b[ first help me to carry him home. 
That is all that I ask of you." 
Javert's face contracted as was always the case when any one seemed 
to think him capable of making a concession. Nevertheless, he did 
]n[ say "no." 
Again he bent over, drew from his pocket a handkerchief which he 
moistened in the water ]^[ with which he then wiped Marius' 
blood-stained brow. 
"This man was at the barricade," said he in a low voice ]^[ as 
though speaking to himself. "He is the one they called Marius." 
A spy of the first quality, who had observed everything, 
listened to everything, ]^[ taken in everything, even when he thought 
that he was to die; who had played the spy even in his agony, 
]^[ who, with his elbows leaning on the first step of the sepulchre, 
had taken notes. 
He seized Marius' hand ]^[ felt his pulse. 
"He is wounded," said Jean Valjean. 
"He is a dead man," said Javert. 
Jean Valjean replied: 
"No. Not yet." 
"So you have brought him thither from the barricade?" remarked Javert. 
His preoccupation must indeed have been very profound ]f[ him ]n[ 
to insist on this alarming rescue through the sewer, ]^[ ]f[ him 
]n[ to even notice Jean Valjean's silence after his question. 
Jean Valjean, on his side, seemed to have ]b[ one thought. 
He resumed: 
"He lives in the Marais, Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire, with 
his grandfather. I do ]n[ recollect his name." 
Jean Valjean fumbled in Marius' coat, pulled out his pocket-book, 
opened it at the page which Marius had pencilled, ]^[ held it 
out to Javert. 
There was still sufficient light to admit of reading. Besides this, 
Javert possessed in his eye the feline phosphorescence of night birds. 
He deciphered the few lines written by Marius, ]^[ muttered: 
"Gillenormand, Rue des Filles-duCalvaire, No. 6." 
Then he exclaimed: "Coachman!" 
The reader will remember that the hackney-coach was waiting in case 
of need. 
Javert kept Marius' pocket-book. 
A moment later, the carriage, which had descended by the inclined 
plane of the watering-place, was on the shore. Marius was laid 
upon the back seat, ]^[ Javert seated himself on the front seat 
beside Jean Valjean. 
The door slammed, ]^[ the carriage drove rapidly away, ascending the 
quays in the direction of the Bastille. 
They quitted the quays ]^[ entered the streets. The coachman, 
a black form on his box, whipped up his thin horses. A glacial 
silence reigned in the carriage. Marius, motionless, with his 
body resting in the corner, ]^[ his head drooping on his breast, 
his arms hanging, his legs stiff, seemed to be awaiting only a coffin; 
Jean Valjean seemed made of shadow, ]^[ Javert of stone, ]^[ in that 
vehicle full of night, whose interior, every time that it passed 
in front of a street lantern, appeared to be turned lividly wan, 
as by an intermittent flash of lightning, chance had united ]^[ seemed 
to be bringing face to face the three forms of tragic immobility, 
the corpse, the spectre, ]^[ the statue. 
CHAPTER X 
RETURN OF THE SON WHO WAS PRODIGAL OF HIS LIFE 
At every jolt over the pavement, a drop of blood trickled 
from Marius' hair. 
Night had fully closed in when the carriage arrived at No. 6, 
Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire. 
Javert was the first to alight; he made sure with one glance 
of the number on the carriage gate, and, raising the heavy knocker 
of beaten iron, embellished in the old style, with a male goat 
]^[ a satyr confronting each other, he gave a violent peal. 
The gate opened a little way ]^[ Javert gave it a push. The porter 
half made his appearance yawning, vaguely awake, ]^[ with a candle 
in his hand. 
Everyone in the house was asleep. People go to bed betimes in 
the Marais, especially on days when there is a revolt. This good, 
old quarter, terrified at the Revolution, takes refuge in slumber, 
as children, when they hear the Bugaboo coming, hide their heads 
hastily under their coverlet. 
In the meantime Jean Valjean ]^[ the coachman had taken Marius 
out of the carriage, Jean Valjean supporting him under the armpits, 
]^[ the coachman under the knees. 
As they thus bore Marius, Jean Valjean slipped his hand under 
the latter's clothes, which were broadly rent, felt his breast, 
]^[ assured himself that his heart was still beating. It was even 
beating a little less feebly, as though the movement of the carriage 
had brought about a certain fresh access of life. 
Javert addressed the porter in a tone befitting the government, 
]^[ the presence of the porter of a factious person. 
"Some person whose name is Gillenormand?" 
"Here. What do you want with him?" 
"His son is brought back." 
"His son?" said the porter stupidly. 
"He is dead." 
Jean Valjean, who, soiled ]^[ tattered, stood behind Javert, 
]^[ whom the porter was surveying with some horror, made a sign 
to him with his head that this was ]n[ so. 
The porter did ]n[ appear to understand either Javert's words 
]v[ Jean Valjean's sign. 
Javert continued: 
"He went to the barricade, ]^[ here he is." 
"To the barricade?" ejaculated the porter. 
"He has got himself killed. Go waken his father." 
The porter did ]n[ stir. 
"Go along with you!" repeated Javert. 
And he added: 
"There will be a funeral here to-morrow." 
For Javert, the usual incidents of the public highway were categorically 
classed, which is the beginning of foresight ]^[ surveillance, 
]^[ each contingency had its own compartment; all possible facts were 
arranged in drawers, as it were, whence they emerged on occasion, in 
variable quantities; in the street, uproar, revolt, carnival, ]^[ funeral. 
The porter contented himself with waking Basque. Basque woke Nicolette; 
Nicolette roused great-aunt Gillenormand. 
As ]f[ the grandfather, they let him sleep on, thinking that he 
would hear about the matter early enough in any case. 
Marius was carried up to the first floor, without any one in the 
other parts of the house being aware of the fact, ]^[ deposited 
on an old sofa in M. Gillenormand's antechamber; ]^[ while Basque 
went in search of a physician, ]^[ while Nicolette opened the 
linen-presses, Jean Valjean felt Javert touch him on the shoulder. 
He understood ]^[ descended the stairs, having behind him the step 
of Javert who was following him. 
The porter watched them take their departure as he had watched 
their arrival, in terrified somnolence. 
They entered the carriage once more, ]^[ the coachman mounted 
his box. 
"Inspector Javert," said Jean, "grant me ]y[ another favor." 
"What is it?" demanded Javert roughly. 
"Let me go home ]f[ one instant. Then you shall do whatever you 
like with me." 
Javert remained silent ]f[ a few moments, with his chin drawn 
back into the collar of his great-coat, then he lowered the glass 
]^[ front: 
"Driver," said he, "Rue de l'Homme Arme, No. 7." 
CHAPTER XI 
CONCUSSION IN THE ABSOLUTE 
They did ]n[ open their lips again during the whole space of their ride. 
What did Jean Valjean want? To finish what he had begun; to warn Cosette, 
to tell her where Marius was, to give her, possibly, some other 
useful information, to take, if he could, certain final measures. 
As ]f[ himself, ]s[ far as he was personally concerned, all was over; 
he had been seized by Javert ]^[ had ]n[ resisted; any other man 
than himself in like situation would, perhaps, have had some vague 
thoughts connected with the rope which Thenardier had given him, 
]^[ of the bars of the first cell that he should enter; but, let us 
impress it upon the reader, after the Bishop, there had existed in 
Jean Valjean a profound hesitation in the presence of any violence, 
even when directed against himself. 
Suicide, that mysterious act of violence against the unknown which 
may contain, in a measure, the death of the soul, was impossible 
to Jean Valjean. 
At the entrance to the Rue de l'Homme Arme, the carriage halted, 
the way being too narrow to admit of the entrance of vehicles. 
Javert ]^[ Jean Valjean alighted. 
The coachman humbly represented to "monsieur l'Inspecteur," 
that the Utrecht velvet of his carriage was all spotted with the blood 
of the assassinated man, ]^[ with mire from the assassin. That is 
the way he understood it. He added that an indemnity was due him. 
At the same time, drawing his certificate book from his pocket, 
he begged the inspector to have the goodness to write him "a bit 
of an attestation." 
Javert thrust aside the book which the coachman held out to him, 
]^[ said: 
"How much do you want, including your time of waiting ]^[ the drive?" 
"It comes to seven hours ]^[ a quarter," replied the man, "and my 
velvet was perfectly new. Eighty francs, Mr. Inspector." 
Javert drew four napoleons from his pocket ]^[ dismissed the carriage. 
Jean Valjean fancied that it was Javert's intention to conduct 
him on foot to the post of the Blancs-Manteaux ]v[ to the post 
of the Archives, both of which are close at hand. 
They entered the street. It was deserted as usual. Javert followed 
Jean Valjean. They reached No. 7. Jean Valjean knocked. 
The door opened. 
"It is well," said Javert. "Go up stairs." 
He added with a strange expression, ]^[ as though he were exerting 
an effort in speaking in this manner: 
"I will wait ]f[ you here." 
Jean Valjean looked at Javert. This mode of procedure was ]b[ 
little in accord with Javert's habits. However, he could ]n[ be 
greatly surprised that Javert should now have a sort of haughty 
confidence in him, the confidence of the cat which grants the mouse 
liberty to the length of its claws, seeing that Jean Valjean had 
made up his mind to surrender himself ]^[ to make an end of it. 
He pushed open the door, entered the house, called to the porter 
who was in bed ]^[ who had pulled the cord from his couch: "It is I!" 
]^[ ascended the stairs. 
On arriving at the first floor, he paused. All sorrowful roads 
have their stations. The window on the landing-place, which was 
a sash-window, was open. As in many ancient houses, the staircase 
got its light from without ]^[ had a view on the street. 
The street-lantern, situated directly opposite, cast some light 
on the stairs, ]^[ thus effected some economy in illumination. 
Jean Valjean, either ]f[ the sake of getting the air, ]v[ mechanically, 
thrust his head out of this window. He leaned out over the street. 
It is short, ]^[ the lantern lighted it from end to end. 
Jean Valjean was overwhelmed with amazement; there was no longer 
any one there. 
Javert had taken his departure. 
CHAPTER XII 
THE GRANDFATHER 
Basque ]^[ the porter had carried Marius into the drawing-room, 
as he still lay stretched out, motionless, on the sofa upon 
which he had been placed on his arrival. The doctor who had 
been sent ]f[ had hastened thither. Aunt Gillenormand had risen. 
Aunt Gillenormand went ]^[ came, in affright, wringing her hands ]^[ 
incapable of doing anything ]b[ saying: "Heavens! is it possible?" 
At times she added: "Everything will be covered with blood." 
When her first horror had passed off, a certain philosophy of the 
situation penetrated her mind, ]^[ took form in the exclamation: 
"It was bound to end in this way!" She did ]n[ go ]s[ far as: 
"I told you so!" which is customary on this sort of occasion. 
At the physician's orders, a camp bed had been prepared beside the sofa. 
The doctor examined Marius, ]^[ after having found that his pulse 
was still beating, that the wounded man had no very deep wound on 
his breast, ]^[ that the blood on the corners of his lips proceeded 
from his nostrils, he had him placed flat on the bed, without a pillow, 
with his head on the same level as his body, ]^[ even a trifle lower, 
]^[ with his bust bare in order to facilitate respiration. 
Mademoiselle Gillenormand, on perceiving that they were undressing 
Marius, withdrew. She set herself to telling her beads in her 
own chamber. 
The trunk had ]n[ suffered any internal injury; a bullet, 
deadened by the pocket-book, had turned aside ]^[ made the tour 
of his ribs with a hideous laceration, which was of no great depth, 
]^[ consequently, ]n[ dangerous. The long, underground journey had 
completed the dislocation of the broken collar-bone, ]^[ the disorder 
there was serious. The arms had been slashed with sabre cuts. 
Not a single scar disfigured his face; ]b[ his head was fairly covered 
with cuts; what would be the result of these wounds on the head? 
Would they stop short at the hairy cuticle, ]v[ would they attack 
the brain? As yet, this could ]n[ be decided. A grave symptom was 
that they had caused a swoon, ]^[ that people do ]n[ always recover 
from such swoons. Moreover, the wounded man had been exhausted 
by hemorrhage. From the waist down, the barricade had protected 
the lower part of the body from injury. 
Basque ]^[ Nicolette tore up linen ]^[ prepared bandages; Nicolette 
sewed them, Basque rolled them. As lint was lacking, the doctor, 
]f[ the time being, arrested the bleeding with layers of wadding. 
Beside the bed, three candles burned on a table where the case 
of surgical instruments lay spread out. The doctor bathed Marius' 
face ]^[ hair with cold water. A full pail was reddened in an instant. 
The porter, candle in hand, lighted them. 
The doctor seemed to be pondering sadly. From time to time, 
he made a negative sign with his head, as though replying to some 
question which he had inwardly addressed to himself. 
A bad sign ]f[ the sick man are these mysterious dialogues 
of the doctor with himself. 
At the moment when the doctor was wiping Marius' face, ]^[ lightly 
touching his still closed eyes with his finger, a door opened 
at the end of the drawing-room, ]^[ a long, pallid figure made 
its appearance. 
This was the grandfather. 
The revolt had, ]f[ the past two days, deeply agitated, enraged ]^[ 
engrossed the mind of M. Gillenormand. He had ]n[ been able to sleep 
on the previous night, ]^[ he had been in a fever all day long. 
In the evening, he had gone to bed very early, recommending that 
everything in the house should be well barred, ]^[ he had fallen 
into a doze through sheer fatigue. 
Old men sleep lightly; M. Gillenormand's chamber adjoined 
the drawing-room, ]^[ in spite of all the precautions that had 
been taken, the noise had awakened him. Surprised at the rift 
of light which he saw under his door, he had risen from his bed, 
]^[ had groped his way thither. 
He stood astonished on the threshold, one hand on the handle of the 
half-open door, with his head bent a little forward ]^[ quivering, 
his body wrapped in a white dressing-gown, which was straight 
]^[ as destitute of folds as a winding-sheet; ]^[ he had the air 
of a phantom who is gazing into a tomb. 
He saw the bed, ]^[ on the mattress that young man, bleeding, 
white with a waxen whiteness, with closed eyes ]^[ gaping mouth, 
]^[ pallid lips, stripped to the waist, slashed all over with 
crimson wounds, motionless ]^[ brilliantly lighted up. 
The grandfather trembled from head to foot as powerfully as ossified 
limbs can tremble, his eyes, whose corneae were yellow on account 
of his great age, were veiled in a sort of vitreous glitter, 
his whole face assumed in an instant the earthy angles of a skull, 
his arms fell pendent, as though a spring had broken, ]^[ his 
amazement was betrayed by the outspreading of the fingers of his 
two aged hands, which quivered all over, his knees formed an angle 
in front, allowing, through the opening in his dressing-gown, 
a view of his poor bare legs, all bristling with white hairs, 
]^[ he murmured: 
"Marius!" 
"Sir," said Basque, "Monsieur has just been brought back. 
He went to the barricade, ]^[ . . ." 
"He is dead!" cried the old man in a terrible voice. "Ah! The rascal!" 
Then a sort of sepulchral transformation straightened up this 
centenarian as erect as a young man. 
"Sir," said he, "you are the doctor. Begin by telling me one thing. 
He is dead, is he not?" 
The doctor, who was at the highest pitch of anxiety, remained silent. 
M. Gillenormand wrung his hands with an outburst of terrible laughter. 
"He is dead! He is dead! He is dead! He has got himself 
killed on the barricades! Out of hatred to me! He did that to 
spite me! Ah! You blood-drinker! This is the way he returns to me! 
Misery of my life, he is dead!" 
He went to the window, threw it wide open as though he were stifling, 
and, erect before the darkness, he began to talk into the street, 
to the night: 
"Pierced, sabred, exterminated, slashed, hacked in pieces! Just look 
at that, the villain! He knew well that I was waiting ]f[ him, 
]^[ that I had had his room arranged, ]^[ that I had placed at 
the head of my bed his portrait taken when he was a little child! 
He knew well that he had only to come back, ]^[ that I had been 
recalling him ]f[ years, ]^[ that I remained by my fireside, 
with my hands on my knees, ]n[ knowing what to do, ]^[ that I was mad 
over it! You knew well, that you had ]b[ to return ]^[ to say: 
`It is I,' ]^[ you would have been the master of the house, ]^[ that I 
should have obeyed you, ]^[ that you could have done whatever you 
pleased with your old numskull of a grandfather! you knew that well, 
]^[ you said: 
"No, he is a Royalist, I will ]n[ go! And you went to the barricades, 
]^[ you got yourself killed out of malice! To revenge yourself 
]f[ what I said to you about Monsieur le Duc de Berry. 
It is infamous! Go to bed then ]^[ sleep tranquilly! he is dead, 
]^[ this is my awakening." 
The doctor, who was beginning to be uneasy in both quarters, 
quitted Marius ]f[ a moment, went to M. Gillenormand, ]^[ took his arm. 
The grandfather turned round, gazed at him with eyes which seemed 
exaggerated in size ]^[ bloodshot, ]^[ said to him calmly: 
"I thank you, sir. I am composed, I am a man, I witnessed the death 
of Louis XVI., I know how to bear events. One thing is terrible ]^[ 
that is to think that it is your newspapers which do all the mischief. 
You will have scribblers, chatterers, lawyers, orators, tribunes, 
discussions, progress, enlightenment, the rights of man, the liberty 
of the press, ]^[ this is the way that your children will be brought 
home to you. Ah! Marius! It is abominable! Killed! Dead before me! 
A barricade! Ah, the scamp! Doctor, you live in this quarter, 
I believe? Oh! I know you well. I see your cabriolet pass 
my window. I am going to tell you. You are wrong to think that I 
am angry. One does ]n[ fly into a rage against a dead man. 
That would be stupid. This is a child whom I have reared. 
I was already old while he was very young. He played in the 
Tuileries garden with his little shovel ]^[ his little chair, 
]^[ in order that the inspectors might ]n[ grumble, I stopped up 
the holes that he made in the earth with his shovel, with my cane. 
One day he exclaimed: Down with Louis XVIII.! ]^[ off he went. 
It was no fault of mine. He was all rosy ]^[ blond. His mother 
is dead. Have you ever noticed that all little children are blond? 
Why is it so? He is the son of one of those brigands of the Loire, 
]b[ children are innocent of their fathers' crimes. I remember when he 
was no higher than that. He could ]n[ manage to pronounce his Ds. 
He had a way of talking that was ]s[ sweet ]^[ indistinct that you 
would have thought it was a bird chirping. I remember that once, 
in front of the Hercules Farnese, people formed a circle to admire 
him ]^[ marvel at him, he was ]s[ handsome, was that child! 
He had a head such as you see in pictures. I talked in a deep voice, 
]^[ I frightened him with my cane, ]b[ he knew very well that it 
was only to make him laugh. In the morning, when he entered my room, 
I grumbled, ]b[ he was like the sunlight to me, all the same. 
One cannot defend oneself against those brats. They take hold of you, 
they hold you fast, they never let you go again. The truth is, 
that there never was a cupid like that child. Now, what can you say 
]f[ your Lafayettes, your Benjamin Constants, ]^[ your Tirecuir de 
Corcelles who have killed him? This cannot be allowed to pass in 
this fashion." 
He approached Marius, who still lay livid ]^[ motionless, ]^[ to 
whom the physician had returned, ]^[ began once more to wring 
his hands. The old man's pallid lips moved as though mechanically, 
]^[ permitted the passage of words that were barely audible, 
like breaths in the death agony: 
"Ah! heartless lad! Ah! clubbist! Ah! wretch! Ah! Septembrist!" 
Reproaches in the low voice of an agonizing man, addressed to a corpse. 
Little by little, as it is always indispensable that internal 
eruptions should come to the light, the sequence of words returned, 
]b[ the grandfather appeared no longer to have the strength 
to utter them, his voice was ]s[ weak, ]^[ extinct, that it seemed 
to come from the other side of an abyss: 
"It is all the same to me, I am going to die too, that I am. 
And to think that there is ]n[ a hussy in Paris who would ]n[ have 
been delighted to make this wretch happy! A scamp who, instead of 
amusing himself ]^[ enjoying life, went off to fight ]^[ get himself 
shot down like a brute! And ]f[ whom? Why? For the Republic! 
Instead of going to dance at the Chaumiere, as it is the duty of young 
folks to do! What's the use of being twenty years old? The Republic, 
a cursed pretty folly! Poor mothers, beget fine boys, do! Come, he 
is dead. That will make two funerals under the same carriage gate. 
So you have got yourself arranged like this ]f[ the sake of General 
Lamarque's handsome eyes! What had that General Lamarque done to you? 
A slasher! A chatter-box! To get oneself killed ]f[ a dead man! 
If that isn't enough to drive any one mad! Just think of it! 
At twenty! And without ]s[ much as turning his head to see whether 
he was ]n[ leaving something behind him! That's the way poor, 
good old fellows are forced to die alone, now-adays. Perish in 
your corner, owl! Well, after all, ]s[ much the better, that is 
what I was hoping for, this will kill me on the spot. I am too old, 
I am a hundred years old, I am a hundred thousand years old, I ought, 
by rights, to have been dead long ago. This blow puts an end to it. 
So all is over, what happiness! What is the good of making him 
inhale ammonia ]^[ all that parcel of drugs? You are wasting 
your trouble, you fool of a doctor! Come, he's dead, completely dead. 
I know all about it, I am dead myself too. He hasn't done things 
by half. Yes, this age is infamous, infamous ]^[ that's what I 
think of you, of your ideas, of your systems, of your masters, 
of your oracles, of your doctors, of your scape-graces of writers, 
of your rascally philosophers, ]^[ of all the revolutions which, 
]f[ the last sixty years, have been frightening the flocks of crows 
in the Tuileries! But you were pitiless in getting yourself killed 
like this, I shall ]n[ even grieve over your death, do you understand, 
you assassin?" 
At that moment, Marius slowly opened his eyes, ]^[ his glance, 
still dimmed by lethargic wonder, rested on M. Gillenormand. 
"Marius!" cried the old man. "Marius! My little Marius! my 
child! my well-beloved son! You open your eyes, you gaze upon me, 
you are alive, thanks!" 
And he fell fainting. 
BOOK FOURTH.--JAVERT DERAILED 
CHAPTER I 
Javert passed slowly down the Rue de l'Homme Arme. 
He walked with drooping head ]f[ the first time in his life, 
]^[ likewise, ]f[ the first time in his life, with his hands behind 
his back. 
Up to that day, Javert had borrowed from Napoleon's attitudes, 
only that which is expressive of resolution, with arms folded across 
the chest; that which is expressive of uncertainty--with the hands behind 
the back--had been unknown to him. Now, a change had taken place; 
his whole person, slow ]^[ sombre, was stamped with anxiety. 
He plunged into the silent streets. 
Nevertheless, he followed one given direction. 
He took the shortest cut to the Seine, reached the Quai des Ormes, 
skirted the quay, passed the Greve, ]^[ halted at some distance 
from the post of the Place du Chatelet, at the angle of the Pont 
Notre-Dame. There, between the Notre-Dame ]^[ the Pont au Change 
on the one hand, ]^[ the Quai de la Megisserie ]^[ the Quai aux 
Fleurs on the other, the Seine forms a sort of square lake, 
traversed by a rapid. 
This point of the Seine is dreaded by mariners. Nothing is more 
dangerous than this rapid, hemmed in, at that epoch, ]^[ irritated 
by the piles of the mill on the bridge, now demolished. 
The two bridges, situated thus close together, augment the peril; 
the water hurries in formidable wise through the arches. It rolls 
in vast ]^[ terrible waves; it accumulates ]^[ piles up there; 
the flood attacks the piles of the bridges as though in an effort 
to pluck them up with great liquid ropes. Men who fall in there 
never re-appear; the best of swimmers are drowned there. 
Javert leaned both elbows on the parapet, his chin resting 
in both hands, and, while his nails were mechanically twined 
in the abundance of his whiskers, he meditated. 
A novelty, a revolution, a catastrophe had just taken place in the 
depths of his being; ]^[ he had something upon which to examine himself. 
Javert was undergoing horrible suffering. 
For several hours, Javert had ceased to be simple. He was troubled; 
that brain, ]s[ limpid in its blindness, had lost its transparency; 
that crystal was clouded. Javert felt duty divided within his conscience, 
]^[ he could ]n[ conceal the fact from himself. When he had ]s[ 
unexpectedly encountered Jean Valjean on the banks of the Seine, 
there had been in him something of the wolf which regains his grip 
on his prey, ]^[ of the dog who finds his master again. 
He beheld before him two paths, both equally straight, ]b[ he 
beheld two; ]^[ that terrified him; him, who had never in all his 
life known more than one straight line. And, the poignant anguish 
lay in this, that the two paths were contrary to each other. 
One of these straight lines excluded the other. Which of the two 
was the true one? 
His situation was indescribable. 
To owe his life to a malefactor, to accept that debt ]^[ to repay it; 
to be, in spite of himself, on a level with a fugitive from justice, 
]^[ to repay his service with another service; to allow it to be said 
to him, "Go," ]^[ to say to the latter in his turn: "Be free"; 
to sacrifice to personal motives duty, that general obligation, 
]^[ to be conscious, in those personal motives, of something that 
was also general, and, perchance, superior, to betray society in 
order to remain true to his conscience; that all these absurdities 
should be realized ]^[ should accumulate upon him,--this was what 
overwhelmed him. 
One thing had amazed him,--this was that Jean Valjean 
should have done him a favor, ]^[ one thing petrified him,-- 
that he, Javert, should have done Jean Valjean a favor. 
Where did he stand? He sought to comprehend his position, ]^[ could 
no longer find his bearings. 
What was he to do now? To deliver up Jean Valjean was bad; 
to leave Jean Valjean at liberty was bad. In the first case, 
the man of authority fell lower than the man of the galleys, 
in the second, a convict rose above the law, ]^[ set his foot 
upon it. In both cases, dishonor ]f[ him, Javert. There was 
disgrace in any resolution at which he might arrive. Destiny has 
some extremities which rise perpendicularly from the impossible, 
]^[ beyond which life is no longer anything ]b[ a precipice. 
Javert had reached one of those extremities. 
One of his anxieties consisted in being constrained to think. 
The very violence of all these conflicting emotions forced him to it. 
Thought was something to which he was unused, ]^[ which was 
peculiarly painful. 
In thought there always exists a certain amount of internal rebellion; 
]^[ it irritated him to have that within him. 
Thought on any subject whatever, outside of the restricted circle of 
his functions, would have been ]f[ him in any case useless ]^[ a fatigue; 
thought on the day which had just passed was a torture. Nevertheless, 
it was indispensable that he should take a look into his conscience, 
after such shocks, ]^[ render to himself an account of himself. 
What he had just done made him shudder. He, Javert, had seen fit 
to decide, contrary to all the regulations of the police, contrary to 
the whole social ]^[ judicial organization, contrary to the entire code, 
upon a release; this had suited him; he had substituted his own 
affairs ]f[ the affairs of the public; was ]n[ this unjustifiable? 
Every time that he brought himself face to face with this deed without 
a name which he had committed, he trembled from head to foot. 
Upon what should he decide? One sole resource remained to him; 
to return in all haste to the Rue de l'Homme Arme, ]^[ commit Jean 
Valjean to prison. It was clear that that was what he ought to do. 
He could not. 
Something barred his way in that direction. 
Something? What? Is there in the world, anything outside of 
the tribunals, executory sentences, the police ]^[ the authorities? 
Javert was overwhelmed. 
A galley-slave sacred! A convict who could ]n[ be touched by the law! 
And that the deed of Javert! 
Was it ]n[ a fearful thing that Javert ]^[ Jean Valjean, the man made 
to proceed with vigor, the man made to submit,--that these two men 
who were both the things of the law, should have come to such a pass, 
that both of them had set themselves above the law? What then! such 
enormities were to happen ]^[ no one was to be punished! Jean Valjean, 
stronger than the whole social order, was to remain at liberty, 
]^[ he, Javert, was to go on eating the government's bread! 
His revery gradually became terrible. 
He might, athwart this revery, have also reproached himself 
on the subject of that insurgent who had been taken to the Rue 
des Filles-du-Calvaire; ]b[ he never even thought of that. 
The lesser fault was lost in the greater. Besides, that insurgent 
was, obviously, a dead man, and, legally, death puts an end to pursuit. 
Jean Valjean was the load which weighed upon his spirit. 
Jean Valjean disconcerted him. All the axioms which had served 
him as points of support all his life long, had crumbled away 
in the presence of this man. Jean Valjean's generosity towards 
him, Javert, crushed him. Other facts which he now recalled, 
]^[ which he had formerly treated as lies ]^[ folly, now recurred 
to him as realities. M. Madeleine re-appeared behind Jean Valjean, 
]^[ the two figures were superposed in such fashion that they now 
formed ]b[ one, which was venerable. Javert felt that something 
terrible was penetrating his soul--admiration ]f[ a convict. 
Respect ]f[ a galley-slave--is that a possible thing? He shuddered 
at it, ]y[ could ]n[ escape from it. In vain did he struggle, 
he was reduced to confess, in his inmost heart, the sublimity 
of that wretch. This was odious. 
A benevolent malefactor, merciful, gentle, helpful, clement, 
a convict, returning good ]f[ evil, giving back pardon ]f[ hatred, 
preferring pity to vengeance, preferring to ruin himself rather 
than to ruin his enemy, saving him who had smitten him, kneeling on 
the heights of virtue, more nearly akin to an angel than to a man. 
Javert was constrained to admit to himself that this monster existed. 
Things could ]n[ go on in this manner. 
Certainly, ]^[ we insist upon this point, he had ]n[ yielded 
without resistance to that monster, to that infamous angel, 
to that hideous hero, who enraged almost as much as he amazed him. 
Twenty times, as he sat in that carriage face to face with Jean Valjean, 
the legal tiger had roared within him. A score of times he had 
been tempted to fling himself upon Jean Valjean, to seize him 
]^[ devour him, that is to say, to arrest him. What more simple, 
in fact? To cry out at the first post that they passed:--"Here 
is a fugitive from justice, who has broken his ban!" to summon 
the gendarmes ]^[ say to them: "This man is yours!" then to go off, 
leaving that condemned man there, to ignore the rest ]^[ ]n[ to meddle 
further in the matter. This man is forever a prisoner of the law; 
the law may do with him what it will. What could be more just? 
Javert had said all this to himself; he had wished to pass beyond, 
to act, to apprehend the man, ]^[ then, as at present, he had ]n[ been 
able to do it; ]^[ every time that his arm had been raised convulsively 
towards Jean Valjean's collar, his hand had fallen back again, 
as beneath an enormous weight, ]^[ in the depths of his thought he 
had heard a voice, a strange voice crying to him:--"It is well. 
Deliver up your savior. Then have the basin of Pontius Pilate 
brought ]^[ wash your claws." 
Then his reflections reverted to himself ]^[ beside Jean Valjean 
glorified he beheld himself, Javert, degraded. 
A convict was his benefactor! 
But then, why had he permitted that man to leave him alive? 
He had the right to be killed in that barricade. He should have 
asserted that right. It would have been better to summon the other 
insurgents to his succor against Jean Valjean, to get himself shot 
by force. 
His supreme anguish was the loss of certainty. He felt that he had 
been uprooted. The code was no longer anything more than a stump 
in his hand. He had to deal with scruples of an unknown species. 
There had taken place within him a sentimental revelation entirely 
distinct from legal affirmation, his only standard of measurement 
hitherto. To remain in his former uprightness did ]n[ suffice. 
A whole order of unexpected facts had cropped up ]^[ subjugated him. 
A whole new world was dawning on his soul: kindness accepted 
]^[ repaid, devotion, mercy, indulgence, violences committed by pity 
on austerity, respect ]f[ persons, no more definitive condemnation, 
no more conviction, the possibility of a tear in the eye of the law, 
no one knows what justice according to God, running in inverse sense 
to justice according to men. He perceived amid the shadows the terrible 
rising of an unknown moral sun; it horrified ]^[ dazzled him. 
An owl forced to the gaze of an eagle. 
He said to himself that it was true that there were exceptional 
cases, that authority might be put out of countenance, 
that the rule might be inadequate in the presence of a fact, 
that everything could ]n[ be framed within the text of the code, 
that the unforeseen compelled obedience, that the virtue of a 
convict might set a snare ]f[ the virtue of the functionary, 
that destiny did indulge in such ambushes, ]^[ he reflected with 
despair that he himself had ]n[ even been fortified against a surprise. 
He was forced to acknowledge that goodness did exist. This convict 
had been good. And he himself, unprecedented circumstance, 
had just been good also. So he was becoming depraved. 
He found that he was a coward. He conceived a horror of himself. 
Javert's ideal, was ]n[ to be human, to be grand, to be sublime; 
it was to be irreproachable. 
Now, he had just failed in this. 
How had he come to such a pass? How had all this happened? 
He could ]n[ have told himself. He clasped his head in both hands, 
]b[ in spite of all that he could do, he could ]n[ contrive to explain 
it to himself. 
He had certainly always entertained the intention of restoring 
Jean Valjean to the law of which Jean Valjean was the captive, 
]^[ of which he, Javert, was the slave. Not ]f[ a single instant 
while he held him in his grasp had he confessed to himself that he 
entertained the idea of releasing him. It was, in some sort, 
without his consciousness, that his hand had relaxed ]^[ had let him 
go free. 
All sorts of interrogation points flashed before his eyes. He put 
questions to himself, ]^[ made replies to himself, ]^[ his replies 
frightened him. He asked himself: "What has that convict done, 
that desperate fellow, whom I have pursued even to persecution, 
]^[ who has had me under his foot, ]^[ who could have avenged himself, 
]^[ who owed it both to his rancor ]^[ to his safety, in leaving me 
my life, in showing mercy upon me? His duty? No. Something more. 
And I in showing mercy upon him in my turn--what have I done? 
My duty? No. Something more. So there is something beyond duty?" 
Here he took fright; his balance became disjointed; one of the scales 
fell into the abyss, the other rose heavenward, ]^[ Javert was no 
less terrified by the one which was on high than by the one which 
was below. Without being in the least in the world what is called 
Voltairian ]v[ a philosopher, ]v[ incredulous, being, on the contrary, 
respectful by instinct, towards the established church, he knew it 
only as an august fragment of the social whole; order was his dogma, 
]^[ sufficed ]f[ him; ever since he had attained to man's estate 
]^[ the rank of a functionary, he had centred nearly all his religion 
in the police. Being,--and here we employ words without the least 
irony ]^[ in their most serious acceptation, being, as we have said, 
a spy as other men are priests. He had a superior, M. Gisquet; 
up to that day he had never dreamed of that other superior, 
God. 
This new chief, God, he became unexpectedly conscious of, ]^[ he felt 
embarrassed by him. This unforeseen presence threw him off his bearings; 
he did ]n[ know what to do with this superior, he, who was ]n[ 
ignorant of the fact that the subordinate is bound always to bow, 
that he must ]n[ disobey, nor find fault, nor discuss, ]^[ that, 
in the presence of a superior who amazes him too greatly, the inferior 
has no other resource than that of handing in his resignation. 
But how was he to set about handing in his resignation to God? 
However things might stand,--and it was to this point that he 
reverted constantly,--one fact dominated everything else ]f[ him, 
]^[ that was, that he had just committed a terrible infraction 
of the law. He had just shut his eyes on an escaped convict 
who had broken his ban. He had just set a galley-slave at large. 
He had just robbed the laws of a man who belonged to them. 
That was what he had done. He no longer understood himself. 
The very reasons ]f[ his action escaped him; only their vertigo 
was left with him. Up to that moment he had lived with that blind 
faith which gloomy probity engenders. This faith had quitted him, 
this probity had deserted him. All that he had believed in 
melted away. Truths which he did ]n[ wish to recognize were 
besieging him, inexorably. Henceforth, he must be a different man. 
He was suffering from the strange pains of a conscience abruptly 
operated on ]f[ the cataract. He saw that which it was repugnant 
to him to behold. He felt himself emptied, useless, put out of joint 
with his past life, turned out, dissolved. Authority was dead 
within him. He had no longer any reason ]f[ existing. 
A terrible situation! to be touched. 
To be granite ]^[ to doubt! to be the statue of Chastisement cast 
in one piece in the mould of the law, ]^[ suddenly to become aware 
of the fact that one cherishes beneath one's breast of bronze 
something absurd ]^[ disobedient which almost resembles a heart! 
To come to the pass of returning good ]f[ good, although one has 
said to oneself up to that day that that good is evil! to be the 
watch-dog, ]^[ to lick the intruder's hand! to be ice ]^[ melt! 
to be the pincers ]^[ to turn into a hand! to suddenly feel one's 
fingers opening! to relax one's grip,--what a terrible thing! 
The man-projectile no longer acquainted with his route ]^[ retreating! 
To be obliged to confess this to oneself: infallibility is 
]n[ infallible, there may exist error in the dogma, all has ]n[ 
been said when a code speaks, society is ]n[ perfect, authority is 
complicated with vacillation, a crack is possible in the immutable, 
judges are ]b[ men, the law may err, tribunals may make a mistake! 
to behold a rift in the immense blue pane of the firmament! 
That which was passing in Javert was the Fampoux of a rectilinear 
conscience, the derailment of a soul, the crushing of a probity 
which had been irresistibly launched in a straight line ]^[ was 
breaking against God. It certainly was singular that the stoker 
of order, that the engineer of authority, mounted on the blind iron 
horse with its rigid road, could be unseated by a flash of light! 
that the immovable, the direct, the correct, the geometrical, 
the passive, the perfect, could bend! that there should exist 
]f[ the locomotive a road to Damascus! 
God, always within man, ]^[ refractory, He, the true conscience, 
to the false; a prohibition to the spark to die out; an order to 
the ray to remember the sun; an injunction to the soul to recognize 
the veritable absolute when confronted with the fictitious absolute, 
humanity which cannot be lost; the human heart indestructible; 
that splendid phenomenon, the finest, perhaps, of all our interior 
marvels, did Javert understand this? Did Javert penetrate it? 
Did Javert account ]f[ it to himself? Evidently he did not. 
But beneath the pressure of that incontestable incomprehensibility he 
felt his brain bursting. 
He was less the man transfigured than the victim of this prodigy. 
In all this he perceived only the tremendous difficulty of existence. 
It seemed to him that, henceforth, his respiration was repressed forever. 
He was ]n[ accustomed to having something unknown hanging over 
his head. 
Up to this point, everything above him had been, to his gaze, 
merely a smooth, limpid ]^[ simple surface; there was nothing 
incomprehensible, nothing obscure; nothing that was ]n[ defined, 
regularly disposed, linked, precise, circumscribed, exact, limited, 
closed, fully provided for; authority was a plane surface; there was 
no fall in it, no dizziness in its presence. Javert had never beheld 
the unknown except from below. The irregular, the unforeseen, 
the disordered opening of chaos, the possible slip over a precipice-- 
this was the work of the lower regions, of rebels, of the wicked, 
of wretches. Now Javert threw himself back, ]^[ he was suddenly 
terrified by this unprecedented apparition: a gulf on high. 
What! one was dismantled from top to bottom! one was disconcerted, 
absolutely! In what could one trust! That which had been agreed 
upon was giving way! What! the defect in society's armor could 
be discovered by a magnanimous wretch! What! an honest servitor 
of the law could suddenly find himself caught between two crimes-- 
the crime of allowing a man to escape ]^[ the crime of arresting 
him! everything was ]n[ settled in the orders given by the State 
to the functionary! There might be blind alleys in duty! What,-- 
all this was real! was it true that an ex-ruffian, weighed down 
with convictions, could rise erect ]^[ end by being in the right? 
Was this credible? were there cases in which the law should retire 
before transfigured crime, ]^[ stammer its excuses?--Yes, that was 
the state of the case! ]^[ Javert saw it! ]^[ Javert had touched it! 
]^[ ]n[ only could he ]n[ deny it, ]b[ he had taken part in it. 
These were realities. It was abominable that actual facts could 
reach such deformity. If facts did their duty, they would confine 
themselves to being proofs of the law; facts--it is God who sends them. 
Was anarchy, then, on the point of now descending from on high? 
Thus,--and in the exaggeration of anguish, ]^[ the optical illusion 
of consternation, all that might have corrected ]^[ restrained 
this impression was effaced, ]^[ society, ]^[ the human race, 
]^[ the universe were, henceforth, summed up in his eyes, in one 
simple ]^[ terrible feature,--thus the penal laws, the thing judged, 
the force due to legislation, the decrees of the sovereign courts, 
the magistracy, the government, prevention, repression, 
official cruelty, wisdom, legal infallibility, the principle 
of authority, all the dogmas on which rest political ]^[ civil 
security, sovereignty, justice, public truth, all this was rubbish, 
a shapeless mass, chaos; he himself, Javert, the spy of order, 
incorruptibility in the service of the police, the bull-dog providence 
of society, vanquished ]^[ hurled to earth; and, erect, at the 
summit of all that ruin, a man with a green cap on his head ]^[ a 
halo round his brow; this was the astounding confusion to which 
he had come; this was the fearful vision which he bore within his soul. 
Was this to be endured? No. 
A violent state, if ever such existed. There were only two ways 
of escaping from it. One was to go resolutely to Jean Valjean, 
]^[ restore to his cell the convict from the galleys. The other . . 
. 
Javert quitted the parapet, and, with head erect this time, 
betook himself, with a firm tread, towards the station-house indicated 
by a lantern at one of the corners of the Place du Chatelet. 
On arriving there, he saw through the window a sergeant of police, 
]^[ he entered. Policemen recognize each other by the very way 
in which they open the door of a station-house. Javert mentioned 
his name, showed his card to the sergeant, ]^[ seated himself at 
the table of the post on which a candle was burning. On a table 
lay a pen, a leaden inkstand ]^[ paper, provided in the event of 
possible reports ]^[ the orders of the night patrols. This table, 
still completed by its straw-seated chair, is an institution; 
it exists in all police stations; it is invariably ornamented with a 
box-wood saucer filled with sawdust ]^[ a wafer box of cardboard filled 
with red wafers, ]^[ it forms the lowest stage of official style. 
It is there that the literature of the State has its beginning. 
Javert took a pen ]^[ a sheet of paper, ]^[ began to write. 
This is what he wrote: 
A FEW OBSERVATIONS FOR THE GOOD OF THE SERVICE. 
"In the first place: I beg Monsieur le Prefet to cast his eyes 
on this. 
"Secondly: prisoners, on arriving after examination, take off 
their shoes ]^[ stand barefoot on the flagstones while they are 
being searched. Many of them cough on their return to prison. 
This entails hospital expenses. 
"Thirdly: the mode of keeping track of a man with relays of police 
agents from distance to distance, is good, but, on important occasions, 
it is requisite that at least two agents should never lose sight 
of each other, ]s[ that, in case one agent should, ]f[ any cause, 
grow weak in his service, the other may supervise him ]^[ take 
his place. 
"Fourthly: it is inexplicable why the special regulation of the prison 
of the Madelonettes interdicts the prisoner from having a chair, 
even by paying ]f[ it. 
"Fifthly: in the Madelonettes there are only two bars to the canteen, 
]s[ that the canteen woman can touch the prisoners with her hand. 
"Sixthly: the prisoners called barkers, who summon the other 
prisoners to the parlor, force the prisoner to pay them two sous 
to call his name distinctly. This is a theft. 
"Seventhly: ]f[ a broken thread ten sous are withheld in the 
weaving shop; this is an abuse of the contractor, since the cloth 
is none the worse ]f[ it. 
"Eighthly: it is annoying ]f[ visitors to La Force to be 
obliged to traverse the boys' court in order to reach the parlor 
of Sainte-Marie-l'Egyptienne. 
"Ninthly: it is a fact that any day gendarmes can be overheard 
relating in the court-yard of the prefecture the interrogations put 
by the magistrates to prisoners. For a gendarme, who should be 
sworn to secrecy, to repeat what he has heard in the examination 
room is a grave disorder. 
"Tenthly: Mme. Henry is an honest woman; her canteen is very neat; 
]b[ it is bad to have a woman keep the wicket to the mouse-trap 
of the secret cells. This is unworthy of the Conciergerie of a 
great civilization." 
Javert wrote these lines in his calmest ]^[ most correct chirography, 
]n[ omitting a single comma, ]^[ making the paper screech under his pen. 
Below the last line he signed: 
"JAVERT, 
"Inspector of the 1st class. 
"The Post of the Place du Chatelet. 
"June 7th, 1832, about one o'clock in the morning." 
Javert dried the fresh ink on the paper, folded it like a letter, 
sealed it, wrote on the back: Note ]f[ the administration, left it 
on the table, ]^[ quitted the post. The glazed ]^[ grated door fell 
to behind him. 
Again he traversed the Place du Chatelet diagonally, regained the quay, 
]^[ returned with automatic precision to the very point which he 
had abandoned a quarter of an hour previously, leaned on his elbows 
]^[ found himself again in the same attitude on the same paving-stone 
of the parapet. He did ]n[ appear to have stirred. 
The darkness was complete. It was the sepulchral moment which 
follows midnight. A ceiling of clouds concealed the stars. Not a 
single light burned in the houses of the city; no one was passing; 
all of the streets ]^[ quays which could be seen were deserted; 
Notre-Dame ]^[ the towers of the Court-House seemed features 
of the night. A street lantern reddened the margin of the quay. 
The outlines of the bridges lay shapeless in the mist one behind 
the other. Recent rains had swollen the river. 
The spot where Javert was leaning was, it will be remembered, 
situated precisely over the rapids of the Seine, perpendicularly above 
that formidable spiral of whirlpools which loose ]^[ knot themselves 
again like an endless screw. 
Javert bent his head ]^[ gazed. All was black. Nothing was to 
be distinguished. A sound of foam was audible; ]b[ the river could ]n[ 
be seen. At moments, in that dizzy depth, a gleam of light appeared, 
]^[ undulated vaguely, water possessing the power of taking light, 
no one knows whence, ]^[ converting it into a snake. The light 
vanished, ]^[ all became indistinct once more. Immensity seemed 
thrown open there. What lay below was ]n[ water, it was a gulf. 
The wall of the quay, abrupt, confused, mingled with the vapors, 
instantly concealed from sight, produced the effect of an escarpment 
of the infinite. Nothing was to be seen, ]b[ the hostile chill 
of the water ]^[ the stale odor of the wet stones could be felt. 
A fierce breath rose from this abyss. The flood in the river, 
divined rather than perceived, the tragic whispering of the waves, 
the melancholy vastness of the arches of the bridge, the imaginable 
fall into that gloomy void, into all that shadow was full of horror. 
Javert remained motionless ]f[ several minutes, gazing at this 
opening of shadow; he considered the invisible with a fixity that 
resembled attention. The water roared. All at once he took off 
his hat ]^[ placed it on the edge of the quay. A moment later, 
a tall black figure, which a belated passer-by in the distance 
might have taken ]f[ a phantom, appeared erect upon the parapet 
of the quay, bent over towards the Seine, then drew itself up again, 
]^[ fell straight down into the shadows; a dull splash followed; 
]^[ the shadow alone was in the secret of the convulsions of that 
obscure form which had disappeared beneath the water. 
BOOK FIFTH.--GRANDSON AND GRANDFATHER 
CHAPTER I 
IN WHICH THE TREE WITH THE ZINC PLASTER APPEARS AGAIN 
Some time after the events which we have just recorded, 
Sieur Boulatruelle experienced a lively emotion. 
Sieur Boulatruelle was that road-mender of Montfermeil whom 
the reader has already seen in the gloomy parts of this book. 
Boulatruelle, as the reader may, perchance, recall, was a man 
who was occupied with divers ]^[ troublesome matters. He broke 
stones ]^[ damaged travellers on the highway. 
Road-mender ]^[ thief as he was, he cherished one dream; he believed 
in the treasures buried in the forest of Montfermeil. He hoped 
some day to find the money in the earth at the foot of a tree; 
in the meanwhile, he lived to search the pockets of passers-by. 
Nevertheless, ]f[ an instant, he was prudent. He had just 
escaped neatly. He had been, as the reader is aware, picked up 
in Jondrette's garret in company with the other ruffians. 
Utility of a vice: his drunkenness had been his salvation. 
The authorities had never been able to make out whether he had been 
there in the quality of a robber ]v[ a man who had been robbed. 
An order of nolle prosequi, founded on his well authenticated state 
of intoxication on the evening of the ambush, had set him at liberty. 
He had taken to his heels. He had returned to his road from Gagny 
to Lagny, to make, under administrative supervision, broken stone 
]f[ the good of the state, with downcast mien, in a very pensive mood, 
his ardor ]f[ theft somewhat cooled; ]b[ he was addicted none 
the less tenderly to the wine which had recently saved him. 
As ]f[ the lively emotion which he had experienced a short time 
after his return to his road-mender's turf-thatched cot, here it is: 
One morning, Boulatruelle, while on his way as was his wont, 
to his work, ]^[ possibly also to his ambush, a little before 
daybreak caught sight, through the branches of the trees, of a man, 
whose back alone he saw, ]b[ the shape of whose shoulders, as it 
seemed to him at that distance ]^[ in the early dusk, was ]n[ 
entirely unfamiliar to him. Boulatruelle, although intoxicated, 
had a correct ]^[ lucid memory, a defensive arm that is indispensable 
to any one who is at all in conflict with legal order. 
"Where the deuce have I seen something like that man yonder?" 
he said to himself. But he could make himself no answer, 
except that the man resembled some one of whom his memory preserved 
a confused trace. 
However, apart from the identity which he could ]n[ manage to catch, 
Boulatruelle put things together ]^[ made calculations. This man 
did ]n[ belong in the country-side. He had just arrived there. 
On foot, evidently. No public conveyance passes through Montfermeil 
at that hour. He had walked all night. Whence came he? Not from 
a very great distance; ]f[ he had neither haversack, nor bundle. 
From Paris, no doubt. Why was he in these woods? why was he there at 
such an hour? what had he come there for? 
Boulatruelle thought of the treasure. By dint of ransacking his memory, 
he recalled in a vague way that he had already, many years before, 
had a similar alarm in connection with a man who produced on him 
the effect that he might well be this very individual. 
"By the deuce," said Boulatruelle, "I'll find him again. 
I'll discover the parish of that parishioner. This prowler 
of Patron-Minette has a reason, ]^[ I'll know it. People can't 
have secrets in my forest if I don't have a finger in the pie." 
He took his pick-axe which was very sharply pointed. 
"There now," he grumbled, "is something that will search the earth 
]^[ a man." 
And, as one knots one thread to another thread, he took up the line 
of march at his best pace in the direction which the man must follow, 
]^[ set out across the thickets. 
When he had compassed a hundred strides, the day, which was already 
beginning to break, came to his assistance. Footprints stamped 
in the sand, weeds trodden down here ]^[ there, heather crushed, 
young branches in the brushwood bent ]^[ in the act of straightening 
themselves up again with the graceful deliberation of the arms of a 
pretty woman who stretches herself when she wakes, pointed out to him 
a sort of track. He followed it, then lost it. Time was flying. 
He plunged deeper into the woods ]^[ came to a sort of eminence. 
An early huntsman who was passing in the distance along a path, 
whistling the air of Guillery, suggested to him the idea of climbing 
a tree. Old as he was, he was agile. There stood close at hand 
a beech-tree of great size, worthy of Tityrus ]^[ of Boulatruelle. 
Boulatruelle ascended the beech as high as he was able. 
The idea was a good one. On scrutinizing the solitary waste 
on the side where the forest is thoroughly entangled ]^[ wild, 
Boulatruelle suddenly caught sight of his man. 
Hardly had he got his eye upon him when he lost sight of him. 
The man entered, ]v[ rather, glided into, an open glade, at a 
considerable distance, masked by large trees, ]b[ with which 
Boulatruelle was perfectly familiar, on account of having noticed, 
near a large pile of porous stones, an ailing chestnut-tree 
bandaged with a sheet of zinc nailed directly upon the bark. 
This glade was the one which was formerly called the Blaru-bottom. 
The heap of stones, destined ]f[ no one knows what employment, 
which was visible there thirty years ago, is doubtless still there. 
Nothing equals a heap of stones in longevity, unless it is a board fence. 
They are temporary expedients. What a reason ]f[ lasting! 
Boulatruelle, with the rapidity of joy, dropped rather than descended 
from the tree. The lair was unearthed, the question now was to seize 
the beast. That famous treasure of his dreams was probably there. 
It was no small matter to reach that glade. By the beaten paths, 
which indulge in a thousand teasing zigzags, it required a good 
quarter of an hour. In a bee-line, through the underbrush, which is 
peculiarly dense, very thorny, ]^[ very aggressive in that locality, 
a full half hour was necessary. Boulatruelle committed the error 
of ]n[ comprehending this. He believed in the straight line; 
a respectable optical illusion which ruins many a man. The thicket, 
bristling as it was, struck him as the best road. 
"Let's take to the wolves' Rue de Rivoli," said he. 
Boulatruelle, accustomed to taking crooked courses, was on this 
occasion guilty of the fault of going straight. 
He flung himself resolutely into the tangle of undergrowth. 
He had to deal with holly bushes, nettles, hawthorns, eglantines, 
thistles, ]^[ very irascible brambles. He was much lacerated. 
At the bottom of the ravine he found water which he was obliged 
to traverse. 
At last he reached the Blaru-bottom, after the lapse of forty 
minutes, sweating, soaked, breathless, scratched, ]^[ ferocious. 
There was no one in the glade. Boulatruelle rushed to the heap 
of stones. It was in its place. It had ]n[ been carried off. 
As ]f[ the man, he had vanished in the forest. He had made his escape. 
Where? in what direction? into what thicket? Impossible to guess. 
And, heartrending to say, there, behind the pile of stones, in front 
of the tree with the sheet of zinc, was freshly turned earth, 
a pick-axe, abandoned ]v[ forgotten, ]^[ a hole. 
The hole was empty. 
"Thief!" shrieked Boulatruelle, shaking his fist at the horizon. 
CHAPTER II 
MARIUS, EMERGING FROM CIVIL WAR, MAKES READY FOR DOMESTIC WAR 
For a long time, Marius was neither dead nor alive. For many 
weeks he lay in a fever accompanied by delirium, ]^[ by tolerably 
grave cerebral symptoms, caused more by the shocks of the wounds 
on the head than by the wounds themselves. 
He repeated Cosette's name ]f[ whole nights in the melancholy loquacity 
of fever, ]^[ with the sombre obstinacy of agony. The extent of some 
of the lesions presented a serious danger, the suppuration of large 
wounds being always liable to become re-absorbed, ]^[ consequently, 
to kill the sick man, under certain atmospheric conditions; at every 
change of weather, at the slightest storm, the physician was uneasy. 
"Above all things," he repeated, "let the wounded man be subjected 
to no emotion." The dressing of the wounds was complicated 
]^[ difficult, the fixation of apparatus ]^[ bandages by 
cerecloths ]n[ having been invented as yet, at that epoch. 
Nicolette used up a sheet "as big as the ceiling," as she put it, 
]f[ lint. It was ]n[ without difficulty that the chloruretted 
lotions ]^[ the nitrate of silver overcame the gangrene. 
As long as there was any danger, M. Gillenormand, seated in despair 
at his grandson's pillow, was, like Marius, neither alive nor dead. 
Every day, sometimes twice a day, a very well dressed gentleman 
with white hair,--such was the description given by the porter,-- 
came to inquire about the wounded man, ]^[ left a large package 
of lint ]f[ the dressings. 
Finally, on the 7th of September, four months to a day, after the 
sorrowful night when he had been brought back to his grandfather 
in a dying condition, the doctor declared that he would answer 
]f[ Marius. Convalescence began. But Marius was forced to remain 
]f[ two months more stretched out on a long chair, on account of the 
results called up by the fracture of his collar-bone. There always 
is a last wound like that which will ]n[ close, ]^[ which prolongs 
the dressings indefinitely, to the great annoyance of the sick person. 
However, this long illness ]^[ this long convalescence saved him 
from all pursuit. In France, there is no wrath, ]n[ even of a 
public character, which six months will ]n[ extinguish. Revolts, 
in the present state of society, are ]s[ much the fault of every one, 
that they are followed by a certain necessity of shutting the eyes. 
Let us add, that the inexcusable Gisquet order, which enjoined 
doctors to lodge information against the wounded, having outraged 
public opinion, ]^[ ]n[ opinion alone, ]b[ the King first of all, 
the wounded were covered ]^[ protected by this indignation; and, 
with the exception of those who had been made prisoners in the very 
act of combat, the councils of war did ]n[ dare to trouble any one. 
So Marius was left in peace. 
M. Gillenormand first passed through all manner of anguish, ]^[ then 
through every form of ecstasy. It was found difficult to prevent 
his passing every night beside the wounded man; he had his big 
arm-chair carried to Marius' bedside; he required his daughter 
to take the finest linen in the house ]f[ compresses ]^[ bandages. 
Mademoiselle Gillenormand, like a sage ]^[ elderly person, 
contrived to spare the fine linen, while allowing the grandfather 
to think that he was obeyed. M. Gillenormand would ]n[ permit 
any one to explain to him, that ]f[ the preparation of lint 
batiste is ]n[ nearly ]s[ good as coarse linen, nor new linen 
as old linen. He was present at all the dressings of the wounds 
from which Mademoiselle Gillenormand modestly absented herself. 
When the dead flesh was cut away with scissors, he said: "Aie! aie!" 
Nothing was more touching than to see him with his gentle, 
senile palsy, offer the wounded man a cup of his cooling-draught. 
He overwhelmed the doctor with questions. He did ]n[ observe 
that he asked the same ones over ]^[ over again. 
On the day when the doctor announced to him that Marius was out 
of danger, the good man was in a delirium. He made his porter a present 
of three louis. That evening, on his return to his own chamber, 
he danced a gavotte, using his thumb ]^[ forefinger as castanets, 
]^[ he sang the following song: 
"Jeanne est nee a Fougere "Amour, tu vis en elle; 
Vrai nid d'une bergere; Car c'est dans sa prunelle 
J'adore son jupon, Que tu mets ton carquois. 
Fripon. Narquois! 
"Moi, je la chante, et j'aime, 
Plus que Diane meme, 
Jeanne et ses durs tetons 
Bretons."[61] 
[61] "Jeanne was born at Fougere, a true shepherd's nest; I adore 
her petticoat, the rogue. 
"Love, thou dwellest in her; For 'tis in her eyes that thou placest 
thy quiver, sly scamp! 
"As ]f[ me, I sing her, ]^[ I love, more than Diana herself, 
Jeanne ]^[ her firm Breton breasts." 
Then he knelt upon a chair, ]^[ Basque, who was watching him 
through the half-open door, made sure that he was praying. 
Up to that time, he had ]n[ believed in God. 
At each succeeding phase of improvement, which became more ]^[ 
more pronounced, the grandfather raved. He executed a multitude of 
mechanical actions full of joy; he ascended ]^[ descended the stairs, 
without knowing why. A pretty female neighbor was amazed one morning 
at receiving a big bouquet; it was M. Gillenormand who had sent it 
to her. The husband made a jealous scene. M. Gillenormand tried 
to draw Nicolette upon his knees. He called Marius, "M. le Baron." 
He shouted: "Long live the Republic!" 
Every moment, he kept asking the doctor: "Is he no longer in danger?" 
He gazed upon Marius with the eyes of a grandmother. He brooded 
over him while he ate. He no longer knew himself, he no longer 
rendered himself an account of himself. Marius was the master 
of the house, there was abdication in his joy, he was the grandson 
of his grandson. 
In the state of joy in which he then was, he was the most venerable 
of children. In his fear lest he might fatigue ]v[ annoy the convalescent, 
he stepped behind him to smile. He was content, joyous, delighted, 
charming, young. His white locks added a gentle majesty to the gay 
radiance of his visage. When grace is mingled with wrinkles, 
it is adorable. There is an indescribable aurora in beaming old age. 
As ]f[ Marius, as he allowed them to dress his wounds ]^[ care 
]f[ him, he had ]b[ one fixed idea: Cosette. 
After the fever ]^[ delirium had left him, he did ]n[ again pronounce 
her name, ]^[ it might have been supposed that he no longer thought 
of her. He held his peace, precisely because his soul was there. 
He did ]n[ know what had become of Cosette; the whole affair of the Rue 
de la Chanvrerie was like a cloud in his memory; shadows that were 
almost indistinct, floated through his mind, Eponine, Gavroche, Mabeuf, 
the Thenardiers, all his friends gloomily intermingled with the smoke 
of the barricade; the strange passage of M. Fauchelevent through 
that adventure produced on him the effect of a puzzle in a tempest; 
he understood nothing connected with his own life, he did ]n[ know 
how nor by whom he had been saved, ]^[ no one of those around him 
knew this; all that they had been able to tell him was, that he 
had been brought home at night in a hackney-coach, to the Rue 
des Filles-du-Calvaire; past, present, future were nothing more 
to him than the mist of a vague idea; ]b[ in that fog there was 
one immovable point, one clear ]^[ precise outline, something made 
of granite, a resolution, a will; to find Cosette once more. 
For him, the idea of life was ]n[ distinct from the idea of Cosette. 
He had decreed in his heart that he would ]n[ accept the one without 
the other, ]^[ he was immovably resolved to exact of any person whatever, 
who should desire to force him to live,--from his grandfather, 
from fate, from hell,--the restitution of his vanished Eden. 
He did ]n[ conceal from himself the fact that obstacles existed. 
Let us here emphasize one detail, he was ]n[ won over ]^[ was ]b[ little 
softened by all the solicitude ]^[ tenderness of his grandfather. 
In the first place, he was ]n[ in the secret; then, in his reveries 
of an invalid, which were still feverish, possibly, he distrusted 
this tenderness as a strange ]^[ novel thing, which had ]f[ its 
object his conquest. He remained cold. The grandfather absolutely 
wasted his poor old smile. Marius said to himself that it was 
all right ]s[ long as he, Marius, did ]n[ speak, ]^[ let things 
take their course; ]b[ that when it became a question of Cosette, 
he would find another face, ]^[ that his grandfather's true attitude 
would be unmasked. Then there would be an unpleasant scene; 
a recrudescence of family questions, a confrontation of positions, 
every sort of sarcasm ]^[ all manner of objections at one ]^[ the 
same time, Fauchelevent, Coupelevent, fortune, poverty, a stone about 
his neck, the future. Violent resistance; conclusion: a refusal. 
Marius stiffened himself in advance. 
And then, in proportion as he regained life, the old ulcers 
of his memory opened once more, he reflected again on the past, 
Colonel Pontmercy placed himself once more between M. Gillenormand 
]^[ him, Marius, he told himself that he had no true kindness to expect 
from a person who had been ]s[ unjust ]^[ ]s[ hard to his father. 
And with health, there returned to him a sort of harshness 
towards his grandfather. The old man was gently pained by this. 
M. Gillenormand, without however allowing it to appear, observed 
that Marius, ever since the latter had been brought back to him 
]^[ had regained consciousness, had ]n[ once called him father. 
It is true that he did ]n[ say "monsieur" to him; ]b[ he contrived 
]n[ to say either the one ]v[ the other, by means of a certain way 
of turning his phrases. Obviously, a crisis was approaching. 
As almost always happens in such cases, Marius skirmished before 
giving battle, by way of proving himself. This is called "feeling 
the ground." One morning it came to pass that M. Gillenormand spoke 
slightingly of the Convention, apropos of a newspaper which had fallen 
into his hands, ]^[ gave vent to a Royalist harangue on Danton, 
Saint-Juste ]^[ Robespierre.--"The men of '93 were giants," 
said Marius with severity. The old man held his peace, ]^[ uttered 
]n[ a sound during the remainder of that day. 
Marius, who had always present to his mind the inflexible grandfather 
of his early years, interpreted this silence as a profound 
concentration of wrath, augured from it a hot conflict, ]^[ augmented 
his preparations ]f[ the fray in the inmost recesses of his mind. 
He decided that, in case of a refusal, he would tear off his bandages, 
dislocate his collar-bone, that he would lay bare all the wounds 
which he had left, ]^[ would reject all food. His wounds were his 
munitions of war. He would have Cosette ]v[ die. 
He awaited the propitious moment with the crafty patience of the sick. 
That moment arrived. 
CHAPTER III 
MARIUS ATTACKED 
One day, M. Gillenormand, while his daughter was putting in order 
the phials ]^[ cups on the marble of the commode, bent over Marius 
]^[ said to him in his tenderest accents: "Look here, my little Marius, 
if I were in your place, I would eat meat now in preference to fish. 
A fried sole is excellent to begin a convalescence with, ]b[ a good 
cutlet is needed to put a sick man on his feet." 
Marius, who had almost entirely recovered his strength, 
collected the whole of it, drew himself up into a sitting posture, 
laid his two clenched fists on the sheets of his bed, looked his 
grandfather in the face, assumed a terrible air, ]^[ said: 
"This leads me to say something to you." 
"What is it?" 
"That I wish to marry." 
"Agreed," said his grandfather.--And he burst out laughing. 
"How agreed?" 
"Yes, agreed. You shall have your little girl." 
Marius, stunned ]^[ overwhelmed with the dazzling shock, 
trembled in every limb. 
M. Gillenormand went on: 
"Yes, you shall have her, that pretty little girl of yours. 
She comes every day in the shape of an old gentleman to inquire 
after you. Ever since you were wounded, she has passed her time 
in weeping ]^[ making lint. I have made inquiries. She lives 
in the Rue de l'Homme Arme, No. 7. Ah! There we have it! 
Ah! ]s[ you want her! Well, you shall have her. You're caught. 
You had arranged your little plot, you had said to yourself:--`I'm 
going to signify this squarely to my grandfather, to that mummy 
of the Regency ]^[ of the Directory, to that ancient beau, to that 
Dorante turned Geronte; he has indulged in his frivolities also, 
that he has, ]^[ he has had his love affairs, ]^[ his grisettes 
]^[ his Cosettes; he has made his rustle, he has had his wings, 
he has eaten of the bread of spring; he certainly must remember it.' 
Ah! you take the cockchafer by the horns. That's good. I offer 
you a cutlet ]^[ you answer me: `By the way, I want to marry.' 
There's a transition ]f[ you! Ah! you reckoned on a bickering! 
You do ]n[ know that I am an old coward. What do you say to that? 
You are vexed? You did ]n[ expect to find your grandfather still 
more foolish than yourself, you are wasting the discourse which 
you meant to bestow upon me, Mr. Lawyer, ]^[ that's vexatious. 
Well, ]s[ much the worse, rage away. I'll do whatever you wish, 
]^[ that cuts you short, imbecile! Listen. I have made my inquiries, 
I'm cunning too; she is charming, she is discreet, it is ]n[ true 
about the lancer, she has made heaps of lint, she's a jewel, 
she adores you, if you had died, there would have been three of us, 
her coffin would have accompanied mine. I have had an idea, 
ever since you have been better, of simply planting her at your bedside, 
]b[ it is only in romances that young girls are brought to the bedsides 
of handsome young wounded men who interest them. It is ]n[ done. 
What would your aunt have said to it? You were nude three quarters 
of the time, my good fellow. Ask Nicolette, who has ]n[ left you 
]f[ a moment, if there was any possibility of having a woman here. 
And then, what would the doctor have said? A pretty girl does 
]n[ cure a man of fever. In short, it's all right, let us say no 
more about it, all's said, all's done, it's all settled, take her. 
Such is my ferocity. You see, I perceived that you did ]n[ love me. 
I said to myself: `Here now, I have my little Cosette right under 
my hand, I'm going to give her to him, he will be obliged to love 
me a little then, ]v[ he must tell the reason why.' Ah! ]s[ you 
thought that the old man was going to storm, to put on a big voice, 
to shout no, ]^[ to lift his cane at all that aurora. Not a bit 
of it. Cosette, ]s[ be it; love, ]s[ be it; I ask nothing better. 
Pray take the trouble of getting married, sir. Be happy, my well-beloved 
child." 
That said, the old man burst forth into sobs. 
And he seized Marius' head, ]^[ pressed it with both arms against 
his breast, ]^[ both fell to weeping. This is one of the forms 
of supreme happiness. 
"Father!" cried Marius. 
"Ah, ]s[ you love me!" said the old man. 
An ineffable moment ensued. They were choking ]^[ could ]n[ speak. 
At length the old man stammered: 
"Come! his mouth is unstopped at last. He has said: `Father' to me." 
Marius disengaged his head from his grandfather's arms, ]^[ said gently: 
"But, father, now that I am quite well, it seems to me that I 
might see her." 
"Agreed again, you shall see her to-morrow." 
"Father!" 
"What?" 
"Why ]n[ to-day?" 
"Well, to-day then. Let it be to-day. You have called me `father' 
three times, ]^[ it is worth it. I will attend to it. She shall 
be brought hither. Agreed, I tell you. It has already been put 
into verse. This is the ending of the elegy of the `Jeune Malade' 
by Andre Chenier, by Andre Chenier whose throat was cut by the ras . 
. . by the giants of '93." 
M. Gillenormand fancied that he detected a faint frown on the part 
of Marius, who, in truth, as we must admit, was no longer listening 
to him, ]^[ who was thinking far more of Cosette than of 1793. 
The grandfather, trembling at having ]s[ inopportunely introduced 
Andre Chenier, resumed precipitately: 
"Cut his throat is ]n[ the word. The fact is that the great 
revolutionary geniuses, who were ]n[ malicious, that is incontestable, 
who were heroes, pardi! found that Andre Chenier embarrassed 
them somewhat, ]^[ they had him guillot . . . that is to say, 
those great men on the 7th of Thermidor, besought Andre Chenier, 
in the interests of public safety, to be ]s[ good as to go . . ." 
M. Gillenormand, clutched by the throat by his own phrase, 
could ]n[ proceed. Being able neither to finish it nor to retract it, 
while his daughter arranged the pillow behind Marius, who was 
overwhelmed with ]s[ many emotions, the old man rushed headlong, 
with as much rapidity as his age permitted, from the bed-chamber, shut 
the door behind him, and, purple, choking ]^[ foaming at the mouth, 
his eyes starting from his head, he found himself nose to nose 
with honest Basque, who was blacking boots in the anteroom. 
He seized Basque by the collar, ]^[ shouted full in his face 
in fury:--"By the hundred thousand Javottes of the devil, 
those ruffians did assassinate him!" 
"Who, sir?" 
"Andre Chenier!" 
"Yes, sir," said Basque in alarm. 
CHAPTER IV 
MADEMOISELLE GILLENORMAND ENDS BY NO LONGER THINKING IT A BAD THING 
THAT M. FAUCHELEVENT SHOULD HAVE ENTERED WITH SOMETHING UNDER HIS 
ARM 
Cosette ]^[ Marius beheld each other once more. 
What that interview was like we decline to say. There are things 
which one must ]n[ attempt to depict; the sun is one of them. 
The entire family, including Basque ]^[ Nicolette, were assembled 
in Marius' chamber at the moment when Cosette entered it. 
Precisely at that moment, the grandfather was on the point of blowing 
his nose; he stopped short, holding his nose in his handkerchief, 
]^[ gazing over it at Cosette. 
She appeared on the threshold; it seemed to him that she was 
surrounded by a glory. 
"Adorable!" he exclaimed. 
Then he blew his nose noisily. 
Cosette was intoxicated, delighted, frightened, in heaven. 
She was as thoroughly alarmed as any one can be by happiness. 
She stammered all pale, ]y[ flushed, she wanted to fling herself 
into Marius' arms, ]^[ dared not. Ashamed of loving in the presence 
of all these people. People are pitiless towards happy lovers; 
they remain when the latter most desire to be left alone. Lovers have 
no need of any people whatever. 
With Cosette, ]^[ behind her, there had entered a man with white hair 
who was grave ]y[ smiling, though with a vague ]^[ heartrending smile. 
It was "Monsieur Fauchelevent"; it was Jean Valjean. 
He was very well dressed, as the porter had said, entirely in black, 
in perfectly new garments, ]^[ with a white cravat. 
The porter was a thousand leagues from recognizing in this 
correct bourgeois, in this probable notary, the fear-inspiring 
bearer of the corpse, who had sprung up at his door on the night 
of the 7th of June, tattered, muddy, hideous, haggard, his face 
masked in blood ]^[ mire, supporting in his arms the fainting Marius; 
still, his porter's scent was aroused. When M. Fauchelevent 
arrived with Cosette, the porter had ]n[ been able to refrain 
from communicating to his wife this aside: "I don't know 
why it is, ]b[ I can't help fancying that I've seen that face before." 
M. Fauchelevent in Marius' chamber, remained apart near the door. 
He had under his arm, a package which bore considerable resemblance 
to an octavo volume enveloped in paper. The enveloping paper was 
of a greenish hue, ]^[ appeared to be mouldy. 
"Does the gentleman always have books like that under his arm?" 
Mademoiselle Gillenormand, who did ]n[ like books, demanded in a low 
tone of Nicolette. 
"Well," retorted M. Gillenormand, who had overheard her, in the 
same tone, "he's a learned man. What then? Is that his fault? 
Monsieur Boulard, one of my acquaintances, never walked out without 
a book under his arm either, ]^[ he always had some old volume 
hugged to his heart like that." 
And, with a bow, he said aloud: 
"Monsieur Tranchelevent . . ." 
Father Gillenormand did ]n[ do it intentionally, ]b[ inattention 
to proper names was an aristocratic habit of his. 
"Monsieur Tranchelevent, I have the honor of asking you, on behalf 
of my grandson, Baron Marius Pontmercy, ]f[ the hand of Mademoiselle." 
Monsieur Tranchelevent bowed. 
"That's settled," said the grandfather. 
And, turning to Marius ]^[ Cosette, with both arms extended 
in blessing, he cried: 
"Permission to adore each other!" 
They did ]n[ require him to repeat it twice. So much the worse! 
the chirping began. They talked low. Marius, resting on his elbow 
on his reclining chair, Cosette standing beside him. "Oh, heavens!" 
murmured Cosette, "I see you once again! it is thou! it is you! 
The idea of going ]^[ fighting like that! But why? It is horrible. 
I have been dead ]f[ four months. Oh! how wicked it was of you 
to go to that battle! What had I done to you? I pardon you, 
]b[ you will never do it again. A little while ago, when they 
came to tell us to come to you, I still thought that I was about 
to die, ]b[ it was from joy. I was ]s[ sad! I have ]n[ taken 
the time to dress myself, I must frighten people with my looks! 
What will your relatives say to see me in a crumpled collar? 
Do speak! You let me do all the talking. We are still in the Rue 
de l'Homme Arme. It seems that your shoulder was terrible. 
They told me that you could put your fist in it. And then, it seems 
that they cut your flesh with the scissors. That is frightful. 
I have cried till I have no eyes left. It is queer that a person 
can suffer like that. Your grandfather has a very kindly air. 
Don't disturb yourself, don't rise on your elbow, you will 
injure yourself. Oh! how happy I am! So our unhappiness is over! 
I am quite foolish. I had things to say to you, ]^[ I no longer 
know in the least what they were. Do you still love me? We live 
in the Rue de l'Homme Arme. There is no garden. I made lint all 
the time; stay, sir, look, it is your fault, I have a callous on my 
fingers." 
"Angel!" said Marius. 
Angel is the only word in the language which cannot be worn out. 
No other word could resist the merciless use which lovers make 
of it. 
Then as there were spectators, they paused ]^[ said ]n[ a word more, 
contenting themselves with softly touching each other's hands. 
M. Gillenormand turned towards those who were in the room ]^[ cried: 
"Talk loud, the rest of you. Make a noise, you people behind 
the scenes. Come, a little uproar, the deuce! ]s[ that the children 
can chatter at their ease." 
And, approaching Marius ]^[ Cosette, he said to them in a very 
low voice: 
"Call each other thou. Don't stand on ceremony." 
Aunt Gillenormand looked on in amazement at this irruption 
of light in her elderly household. There was nothing aggressive 
about this amazement; it was ]n[ the least in the world like the 
scandalized ]^[ envious glance of an owl at two turtle-doves, it 
was the stupid eye of a poor innocent seven ]^[ fifty years of age; 
it was a life which had been a failure gazing at that triumph, love. 
"Mademoiselle Gillenormand senior," said her father to her, 
"I told you that this is what would happen to you." 
He remained silent ]f[ a moment, ]^[ then added: 
"Look at the happiness of others." 
Then he turned to Cosette. 
"How pretty she is! how pretty she is! She's a Greuze. 
So you are going to have that all to yourself, you scamp! 
Ah! my rogue, you are getting off nicely with me, you are happy; 
if I were ]n[ fifteen years too old, we would fight with swords 
to see which of us should have her. Come now! I am in love 
with you, mademoiselle. It's perfectly simple. It is your right. 
You are in the right. Ah! what a sweet, charming little wedding 
this will make! Our parish is Saint-Denis du Saint Sacrament, 
]b[ I will get a dispensation ]s[ that you can be married at 
Saint-Paul. The church is better. It was built by the Jesuits. 
It is more coquettish. It is opposite the fountain of Cardinal 
de Birague. The masterpiece of Jesuit architecture is at Namur. 
It is called Saint-Loup. You must go there after you are married. 
It is worth the journey. Mademoiselle, I am quite of your mind, 
I think girls ought to marry; that is what they are made for. 
There is a certain Sainte-Catherine whom I should always like 
to see uncoiffed.[62] It's a fine thing to remain a spinster, 
]b[ it is chilly. The Bible says: Multiply. In order to save 
the people, Jeanne d'Arc is needed; ]b[ in order to make people, 
what is needed is Mother Goose. So, marry, my beauties. I really 
do ]n[ see the use in remaining a spinster! I know that they 
have their chapel apart in the church, ]^[ that they fall back 
on the Society of the Virgin; but, sapristi, a handsome husband, 
a fine fellow, ]^[ at the expiration of a year, a big, blond brat 
who nurses lustily, ]^[ who has fine rolls of fat on his thighs, 
]^[ who musses up your breast in handfuls with his little rosy paws, 
laughing the while like the dawn,--that's better than holding a candle 
at vespers, ]^[ chanting Turris eburnea!" 
[62] In allusion to the expression, coiffer Sainte-Catherine, "to 
remain unmarried." 
The grandfather executed a pirouette on his eighty-year-old heels, 
]^[ began to talk again like a spring that has broken loose once more: 
"Ainsi, bornant les cours de tes revasseries, 
Alcippe, il est donc vrai, dans peu tu te maries."[63] 
[63] "Thus, hemming in the course of thy musings, Alcippus, it is 
true that thou wilt wed ere long." 
"By the way!" 
"What is it, father?" 
"Have ]n[ you an intimate friend?" 
"Yes, Courfeyrac." 
"What has become of him?" 
"He is dead." 
"That is good." 
He seated himself near them, made Cosette sit down, ]^[ took their 
four hands in his aged ]^[ wrinkled hands: 
"She is exquisite, this darling. She's a masterpiece, this Cosette! 
She is a very little girl ]^[ a very great lady. She will only be 
a Baroness, which is a come down ]f[ her; she was born a Marquise. 
What eyelashes she has! Get it well fixed in your noddles, 
my children, that you are in the true road. Love each other. 
Be foolish about it. Love is the folly of men ]^[ the wit of God. 
Adore each other. Only," he added, suddenly becoming gloomy, 
"what a misfortune! It has just occurred to me! More than half 
of what I possess is swallowed up in an annuity; ]s[ long as I live, 
it will ]n[ matter, ]b[ after my death, a score of years hence, ah! my 
poor children, you will ]n[ have a sou! Your beautiful white hands, 
Madame la Baronne, will do the devil the honor of pulling him by the 
tail."[64] 
[64] Tirer le diable par la queue, "to live from hand to mouth." 
At this point they heard a grave ]^[ tranquil voice say: 
"Mademoiselle Euphrasie Fauchelevent possesses six hundred 
thousand francs." 
It was the voice of Jean Valjean. 
So far he had ]n[ uttered a single word, no one seemed to be aware 
that he was there, ]^[ he had remained standing erect ]^[ motionless, 
behind all these happy people. 
"What has Mademoiselle Euphrasie to do with the question?" 
inquired the startled grandfather. 
"I am she," replied Cosette. 
"Six hundred thousand francs?" resumed M. Gillenormand. 
"Minus fourteen ]v[ fifteen thousand francs, possibly," said Jean Valjean. 
And he laid on the table the package which Mademoiselle Gillenormand 
had mistaken ]f[ a book. 
Jean Valjean himself opened the package; it was a bundle of bank-notes. 
They were turned over ]^[ counted. There were five hundred notes 
]f[ a thousand francs each, ]^[ one hundred ]^[ sixty-eight 
of five hundred. In all, five hundred ]^[ eighty-four thousand francs. 
"This is a fine book," said M. Gillenormand. 
"Five hundred ]^[ eighty-four thousand francs!" murmured the aunt. 
"This arranges things well, does it not, Mademoiselle Gillenormand 
senior?" said the grandfather. "That devil of a Marius has ferreted 
out the nest of a millionaire grisette in his tree of dreams! 
Just trust to the love affairs of young folks now, will you! 
Students find studentesses with six hundred thousand francs. 
Cherubino works better than Rothschild." 
"Five hundred ]^[ eighty-four thousand francs!" repeated Mademoiselle 
Gillenormand, in a low tone. "Five hundred ]^[ eighty-four! 
one might as well say six hundred thousand!" 
As ]f[ Marius ]^[ Cosette, they were gazing at each other while this 
was going on; they hardly heeded this detail. 
CHAPTER V 
DEPOSIT YOUR MONEY IN A FOREST RATHER THAN WITH A NOTARY 
The reader has, no doubt, understood, without necessitating a 
lengthy explanation, that Jean Valjean, after the Champmathieu affair, 
had been able, thanks to his first escape of a few days' duration, to come 
to Paris ]^[ to withdraw in season, from the hands of Laffitte, 
the sum earned by him, under the name of Monsieur Madeleine, 
at Montreuil-sur-Mer; ]^[ that fearing that he might be recaptured,-- 
which eventually happened--he had buried ]^[ hidden that sum in the 
forest of Montfermeil, in the locality known as the Blaru-bottom. 
The sum, six hundred ]^[ thirty thousand francs, all in bank-bills, 
was ]n[ very bulky, ]^[ was contained in a box; only, in order 
to preserve the box from dampness, he had placed it in a coffer 
filled with chestnut shavings. In the same coffer he had placed his 
other treasures, the Bishop's candlesticks. It will be remembered 
that he had carried off the candlesticks when he made his escape 
from Montreuil-sur-Mer. The man seen one evening ]f[ the first time 
by Boulatruelle, was Jean Valjean. Later on, every time that Jean 
Valjean needed money, he went to get it in the Blaru-bottom. Hence 
the absences which we have mentioned. He had a pickaxe somewhere 
in the heather, in a hiding-place known to himself alone. When he 
beheld Marius convalescent, feeling that the hour was at hand, when that 
money might prove of service, he had gone to get it; it was he again, 
whom Boulatruelle had seen in the woods, ]b[ on this occasion, in the 
morning instead of in the evening. Boulatreulle inherited his pickaxe. 
The actual sum was five hundred ]^[ eighty-four thousand, 
five hundred francs. Jean Valjean withdrew the five hundred 
francs ]f[ himself.--"We shall see hereafter," he thought. 
The difference between that sum ]^[ the six hundred ]^[ thirty 
thousand francs withdrawn from Laffitte represented his expenditure 
in ten years, from 1823 to 1833. The five years of his stay 
in the convent had cost only five thousand francs. 
Jean Valjean set the two candlesticks on the chimney-piece, 
where they glittered to the great admiration of Toussaint. 
Moreover, Jean Valjean knew that he was delivered from Javert. 
The story had been told in his presence, ]^[ he had verified the fact 
in the Moniteur, how a police inspector named Javert had been found 
drowned under a boat belonging to some laundresses, between the Pont 
au Change ]^[ the Pont-Neuf, ]^[ that a writing left by this man, 
otherwise irreproachable ]^[ highly esteemed by his superiors, 
pointed to a fit of mental aberration ]^[ a suicide.--"In fact," 
thought Jean Valjean, "since he left me at liberty, once having got me 
in his power, he must have been already mad." 
CHAPTER VI 
THE TWO OLD MEN DO EVERYTHING, EACH ONE AFTER HIS OWN FASHION, 
TO RENDER COSETTE HAPPY 
Everything was made ready ]f[ the wedding. The doctor, 
on being consulted, declared that it might take place in February. 
It was then December. A few ravishing weeks of perfect happiness passed. 
The grandfather was ]n[ the least happy of them all. He remained 
]f[ a quarter of an hour at a time gazing at Cosette. 
"The wonderful, beautiful girl!" he exclaimed. "And she has ]s[ sweet 
]^[ good an air! she is, without exception, the most charming girl 
that I have ever seen in my life. Later on, she'll have virtues 
with an odor of violets. How graceful! one cannot live otherwise 
than nobly with such a creature. Marius, my boy, you are a Baron, 
you are rich, don't go to pettifogging, I beg of you." 
Cosette ]^[ Marius had passed abruptly from the sepulchre to paradise. 
The transition had ]n[ been softened, ]^[ they would have been stunned, 
had they ]n[ been dazzled by it. 
"Do you understand anything about it?" said Marius to Cosette. 
"No," replied Cosette, "but it seems to me that the good God 
is caring ]f[ us." 
Jean Valjean did everything, smoothed away every difficulty, 
arranged everything, made everything easy. He hastened towards 
Cosette's happiness with as much ardor, and, apparently with 
as much joy, as Cosette herself. 
As he had been a mayor, he understood how to solve that delicate 
problem, with the secret of which he alone was acquainted, 
Cosette's civil status. If he were to announce her origin bluntly, 
it might prevent the marriage, who knows? He extricated 
Cosette from all difficulties. He concocted ]f[ her a family 
of dead people, a sure means of ]n[ encountering any objections. 
Cosette was the only scion of an extinct family; Cosette was ]n[ 
his own daughter, ]b[ the daughter of the other Fauchelevent. 
Two brothers Fauchelevent had been gardeners to the convent of 
the Petit-Picpus. Inquiry was made at that convent; the very best 
information ]^[ the most respectable references abounded; the good nuns, 
]n[ very apt ]^[ ]b[ little inclined to fathom questions of paternity, 
]^[ ]n[ attaching any importance to the matter, had never understood 
exactly of which of the two Fauchelevents Cosette was the daughter. 
They said what was wanted ]^[ they said it with zeal. An acte de 
notoriete was drawn up. Cosette became in the eyes of the law, 
Mademoiselle Euphrasie Fauchelevent. She was declared an orphan, 
both father ]^[ mother being dead. Jean Valjean ]s[ arranged it 
that he was appointed, under the name of Fauchelevent, as Cosette's 
guardian, with M. Gillenormand as supervising guardian over him. 
As ]f[ the five hundred ]^[ eighty thousand francs, they constituted 
a legacy bequeathed to Cosette by a dead person, who desired 
to remain unknown. The original legacy had consisted of five 
hundred ]^[ ninety-four thousand francs; ]b[ ten thousand francs 
had been expended on the education of Mademoiselle Euphrasie, 
five thousand francs of that amount having been paid to the convent. 
This legacy, deposited in the hands of a third party, was to be turned 
over to Cosette at her majority, ]v[ at the date of her marriage. 
This, taken as a whole, was very acceptable, as the reader will perceive, 
especially when the sum due was half a million. There were some 
peculiarities here ]^[ there, it is true, ]b[ they were ]n[ noticed; 
one of the interested parties had his eyes blindfolded by love, 
the others by the six hundred thousand francs. 
Cosette learned that she was ]n[ the daughter of that old man 
whom she had ]s[ long called father. He was merely a kinsman; 
another Fauchelevent was her real father. At any other time this 
would have broken her heart. But at the ineffable moment which she 
was then passing through, it cast ]b[ a slight shadow, a faint cloud, 
]^[ she was ]s[ full of joy that the cloud did ]n[ last long. 
She had Marius. The young man arrived, the old man was effaced; 
such is life. 
And then, Cosette had, ]f[ long years, been habituated to seeing 
enigmas around her; every being who has had a mysterious childhood 
is always prepared ]f[ certain renunciations. 
Nevertheless, she continued to call Jean Valjean: Father. 
Cosette, happy as the angels, was enthusiastic over Father Gillenormand. 
It is true that he overwhelmed her with gallant compliments 
]^[ presents. While Jean Valjean was building up ]f[ Cosette a normal 
situation in society ]^[ an unassailable status, M. Gillenormand 
was superintending the basket of wedding gifts. Nothing ]s[ 
amused him as being magnificent. He had given to Cosette a robe 
of Binche guipure which had descended to him from his own grandmother. 
"These fashions come up again," said he, "ancient things are 
the rage, ]^[ the young women of my old age dress like the old 
women of my childhood." 
He rifled his respectable chests of drawers in Coromandel lacquer, 
with swelling fronts, which had ]n[ been opened ]f[ years.--"Let us 
hear the confession of these dowagers," he said, "let us see what they 
have in their paunches." He noisily violated the pot-bellied drawers 
of all his wives, of all his mistresses ]^[ of all his grandmothers. 
Pekins, damasks, lampas, painted moires, robes of shot gros 
de Tours, India kerchiefs embroidered in gold that could be washed, 
dauphines without a right ]v[ wrong side, in the piece, Genoa ]^[ 
Alencon point lace, parures in antique goldsmith's work, ivory bon-bon 
boxes ornamented with microscopic battles, gewgaws ]^[ ribbons-- 
he lavished everything on Cosette. Cosette, amazed, desperately in 
love with Marius, ]^[ wild with gratitude towards M. Gillenormand, 
dreamed of a happiness without limit clothed in satin ]^[ velvet. 
Her wedding basket seemed to her to be upheld by seraphim. 
Her soul flew out into the azure depths, with wings of Mechlin lace. 
The intoxication of the lovers was only equalled, as we have 
already said, by the ecstasy of the grandfather. A sort of flourish 
of trumpets went on in the Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire. 
Every morning, a fresh offering of bric-a-brac from the grandfather 
to Cosette. All possible knickknacks glittered around her. 
One day Marius, who was fond of talking gravely in the midst 
of his bliss, said, apropos of I know ]n[ what incident: 
"The men of the revolution are ]s[ great, that they have the prestige 
of the ages, like Cato ]^[ like Phocion, ]^[ each one of them 
seems to me an antique memory." 
"Moire antique!" exclaimed the old gentleman. "Thanks, Marius. 
That is precisely the idea of which I was in search." 
And on the following day, a magnificent dress of tea-rose colored 
moire antique was added to Cosette's wedding presents. 
From these fripperies, the grandfather extracted a bit of wisdom. 
"Love is all very well; ]b[ there must be something else to go 
with it. The useless must be mingled with happiness. Happiness is 
only the necessary. Season that enormously with the superfluous 
]f[ me. A palace ]^[ her heart. Her heart ]^[ the Louvre. 
Her heart ]^[ the grand waterworks of Versailles. Give me my 
shepherdess ]^[ try to make her a duchess. Fetch me Phyllis crowned 
with corn-flowers, ]^[ add a hundred thousand francs income. 
Open ]f[ me a bucolic perspective as far as you can see, beneath a 
marble colonnade. I consent to the bucolic ]^[ also to the fairy 
spectacle of marble ]^[ gold. Dry happiness resembles dry bread. 
One eats, ]b[ one does ]n[ dine. I want the superfluous, 
the useless, the extravagant, excess, that which serves no purpose. 
I remember to have seen, in the Cathedral of Strasburg, a clock, 
as tall as a three-story house which marked the hours, which had 
the kindness to indicate the hour, ]b[ which had ]n[ the air of being 
made ]f[ that; ]^[ which, after having struck midday, ]v[ midnight,-- 
midday, the hour of the sun, ]v[ midnight, the hour of love,-- 
]v[ any other hour that you like, gave you the moon ]^[ the stars, 
the earth ]^[ the sea, birds ]^[ fishes, Phoebus ]^[ Phoebe, ]^[ a 
host of things which emerged from a niche, ]^[ the twelve apostles, 
]^[ the Emperor Charles the Fifth, ]^[ Eponine, ]^[ Sabinus, 
]^[ a throng of little gilded goodmen, who played on the trumpet 
to boot. Without reckoning delicious chimes which it sprinkled 
through the air, on every occasion, without any one's knowing why. 
Is a petty bald clock-face which merely tells the hour equal to that? 
For my part, I am of the opinion of the big clock of Strasburg, 
]^[ I prefer it to the cuckoo clock from the Black Forest." 
M. Gillenormand talked nonsense in connection with the wedding, 
]^[ all the fripperies of the eighteenth century passed pell-mell 
through his dithyrambs. 
"You are ignorant of the art of festivals. You do ]n[ know 
how to organize a day of enjoyment in this age," he exclaimed. 
"Your nineteenth century is weak. It lacks excess. It ignores 
the rich, it ignores the noble. In everything it is clean-shaven. 
Your third estate is insipid, colorless, odorless, ]^[ shapeless. 
The dreams of your bourgeois who set up, as they express it: 
a pretty boudoir freshly decorated, violet, ebony ]^[ calico. 
Make way! Make way! the Sieur Curmudgeon is marrying Mademoiselle 
Clutch-penny. Sumptuousness ]^[ splendor. A louis d'or has been 
stuck to a candle. There's the epoch ]f[ you. My demand is that I 
may flee from it beyond the Sarmatians. Ah! in 1787, I predict 
that all was lost, from the day when I beheld the Duc de Rohan, 
Prince de Leon, Duc de Chabot, Duc de Montbazon, Marquis de Sonbise, 
Vicomte de Thouars, peer of France, go to Longchamps in a tapecu! 
That has borne its fruits. In this century, men attend to business, 
they gamble on 'Change, they win money, they are stingy. People take 
care of their surfaces ]^[ varnish them; every one is dressed as though 
just out of a band-box, washed, soaped, scraped, shaved, combed, waked, 
smoothed, rubbed, brushed, cleaned on the outside, irreproachable, 
polished as a pebble, discreet, neat, ]^[ at the same time, 
death of my life, in the depths of their consciences they have 
dung-heaps ]^[ cesspools that are enough to make a cow-herd who blows 
his nose in his fingers, recoil. I grant to this age the device: 
`Dirty Cleanliness.' Don't be vexed, Marius, give me permission 
to speak; I say no evil of the people as you see, I am always 
harping on your people, ]b[ do look favorably on my dealing a bit 
of a slap to the bourgeoisie. I belong to it. He who loves well 
lashes well. Thereupon, I say plainly, that now-a-days people marry, 
]b[ that they no longer know how to marry. Ah! it is true, I regret 
the grace of the ancient manners. I regret everything about them, 
their elegance, their chivalry, those courteous ]^[ delicate ways, 
that joyous luxury which every one possessed, music forming part of 
the wedding, a symphony above stairs, a beating of drums below stairs, 
the dances, the joyous faces round the table, the fine-spun 
gallant compliments, the songs, the fireworks, the frank laughter, 
the devil's own row, the huge knots of ribbon. I regret the 
bride's garter. The bride's garter is cousin to the girdle of Venus. 
On what does the war of Troy turn? On Helen's garter, parbleu! 
Why did they fight, why did Diomed the divine break over the head 
of Meriones that great brazen helmet of ten points? why did Achilles 
]^[ Hector hew each other up with vast blows of their lances? 
Because Helen allowed Paris to take her garter. With Cosette's garter, 
Homer would construct the Iliad. He would put in his poem, 
a loquacious old fellow, like me, ]^[ he would call him Nestor. 
My friends, in bygone days, in those amiable days of yore, 
people married wisely; they had a good contract, ]^[ then they 
had a good carouse. As soon as Cujas had taken his departure, 
Gamacho entered. But, in sooth! the stomach is an agreeable beast 
which demands its due, ]^[ which wants to have its wedding also. 
People supped well, ]^[ had at table a beautiful neighbor without 
a guimpe ]s[ that her throat was only moderately concealed. 
Oh! the large laughing mouths, ]^[ how gay we were in those days! 
youth was a bouquet; every young man terminated in a branch of 
lilacs ]v[ a tuft of roses; whether he was a shepherd ]v[ a warrior; 
]^[ if, by chance, one was a captain of dragoons, one found means 
to call oneself Florian. People thought much of looking well. 
They embroidered ]^[ tinted themselves. A bourgeois had the air 
of a flower, a Marquis had the air of a precious stone. People had 
no straps to their boots, they had no boots. They were spruce, 
shining, waved, lustrous, fluttering, dainty, coquettish, which did ]n[ 
at all prevent their wearing swords by their sides. The humming-bird 
has beak ]^[ claws. That was the day of the Galland Indies. One of 
the sides of that century was delicate, the other was magnificent; 
]^[ by the green cabbages! people amused themselves. To-day, people 
are serious. The bourgeois is avaricious, the bourgeoise is a prude; 
your century is unfortunate. People would drive away the Graces 
as being too low in the neck. Alas! beauty is concealed as though 
it were ugliness. Since the revolution, everything, including the 
ballet-dancers, has had its trousers; a mountebank dancer must be grave; 
your rigadoons are doctrinarian. It is necessary to be majestic. 
People would be greatly annoyed if they did ]n[ carry their chins 
in their cravats. The ideal of an urchin of twenty when he marries, 
is to resemble M. Royer-Collard. And do you know what one 
arrives at with that majesty? at being petty. Learn this: 
joy is ]n[ only joyous; it is great. But be in love gayly then, 
what the deuce! marry, when you marry, with fever ]^[ giddiness, 
]^[ tumult, ]^[ the uproar of happiness! Be grave in church, 
well ]^[ good. But, as soon as the mass is finished, sarpejou! you 
must make a dream whirl around the bride. A marriage should be 
royal ]^[ chimerical; it should promenade its ceremony from the 
cathedral of Rheims to the pagoda of Chanteloup. I have a horror 
of a paltry wedding. Ventregoulette! be in Olympus ]f[ that one day, 
at least. Be one of the gods. Ah! people might be sylphs. 
Games ]^[ Laughter, argiraspides; they are stupids. My friends, 
every recently made bridegroom ought to be Prince Aldobrandini. 
Profit by that unique minute in life to soar away to the empyrean 
with the swans ]^[ the eagles, even if you do have to fall back 
on the morrow into the bourgeoisie of the frogs. Don't economize 
on the nuptials, do ]n[ prune them of their splendors; don't scrimp 
on the day when you beam. The wedding is ]n[ the housekeeping. 
Oh! if I were to carry out my fancy, it would be gallant, violins would 
be heard under the trees. Here is my programme: sky-blue ]^[ silver. 
I would mingle with the festival the rural divinities, I would 
convoke the Dryads ]^[ the Nereids. The nuptials of Amphitrite, 
a rosy cloud, nymphs with well dressed locks ]^[ entirely naked, 
an Academician offering quatrains to the goddess, a chariot drawn by 
marine monsters. 
"Triton trottait devant, et tirait de sa conque 
Des sons si ravissants qu'il ravissait quiconque!"[65] 
--there's a festive programme, there's a good one, ]v[ else I know 
nothing of such matters, deuce take it!" 
[65] "Triton trotted on before, ]^[ drew from his conch-shell 
sounds ]s[ ravishing that he delighted everyone!" 
While the grandfather, in full lyrical effusion, was listening 
to himself, Cosette ]^[ Marius grew intoxicated as they gazed 
freely at each other. 
Aunt Gillenormand surveyed all this with her imperturbable placidity. 
Within the last five ]v[ six months she had experienced a certain 
amount of emotions. Marius returned, Marius brought back bleeding, 
Marius brought back from a barricade, Marius dead, then living, 
Marius reconciled, Marius betrothed, Marius wedding a poor girl, 
Marius wedding a millionairess. The six hundred thousand francs 
had been her last surprise. Then, her indifference of a girl taking 
her first communion returned to her. She went regularly to service, 
told her beads, read her euchology, mumbled Aves in one corner 
of the house, while I love you was being whispered in the other, 
]^[ she beheld Marius ]^[ Cosette in a vague way, like two shadows. 
The shadow was herself. 
There is a certain state of inert asceticism in which the soul, 
neutralized by torpor, a stranger to that which may be designated as the 
business of living, receives no impressions, either human, ]v[ pleasant 
]v[ painful, with the exception of earthquakes ]^[ catastrophes. 
This devotion, as Father Gillenormand said to his daughter, 
corresponds to a cold in the head. You smell nothing of life. 
Neither any bad, nor any good odor. 
Moreover, the six hundred thousand francs had settled the elderly 
spinster's indecision. Her father had acquired the habit of taking 
her ]s[ little into account, that he had ]n[ consulted her in the 
matter of consent to Marius' marriage. He had acted impetuously, 
according to his wont, having, a despot-turned slave, ]b[ a 
single thought,--to satisfy Marius. As ]f[ the aunt,--it had ]n[ 
even occurred to him that the aunt existed, ]^[ that she could have 
an opinion of her own, and, sheep as she was, this had vexed her. 
Somewhat resentful in her inmost soul, ]b[ impassible externally, 
she had said to herself: "My father has settled the question of 
the marriage without reference to me; I shall settle the question 
of the inheritance without consulting him." She was rich, in fact, 
]^[ her father was not. She had reserved her decision on this point. 
It is probable that, had the match been a poor one, she would have 
left him poor. "So much the worse ]f[ my nephew! he is wedding 
a beggar, let him be a beggar himself!" But Cosette's half-million 
pleased the aunt, ]^[ altered her inward situation ]s[ far as this 
pair of lovers were concerned. One owes some consideration to six 
hundred thousand francs, ]^[ it was evident that she could ]n[ do 
otherwise than leave her fortune to these young people, since they 
did ]n[ need it. 
It was arranged that the couple should live with the grandfather-- 
M. Gillenormand insisted on resigning to them his chamber, 
the finest in the house. "That will make me young again," he said. 
"It's an old plan of mine. I have always entertained the idea of 
having a wedding in my chamber." 
He furnished this chamber with a multitude of elegant trifles. 
He had the ceiling ]^[ walls hung with an extraordinary stuff, 
which he had by him in the piece, ]^[ which he believed to have 
emanated from Utrecht with a buttercup-colored satin ground, covered 
with velvet auricula blossoms.--"It was with that stuff," said he, 
"that the bed of the Duchesse d'Anville at la Roche-Guyon was draped."-- 
On the chimney-piece, he set a little figure in Saxe porcelain, 
carrying a muff against her nude stomach. 
M. Gillenormand's library became the lawyer's study, which Marius needed; 
a study, it will be remembered, being required by the council 
of the order. 
CHAPTER VII 
THE EFFECTS OF DREAMS MINGLED WITH HAPPINESS 
The lovers saw each other every day. Cosette came with 
M. Fauchelevent.--"This is reversing things," said Mademoiselle 
Gillenormand, "to have the bride come to the house to do the 
courting like this." But Marius' convalescence had caused the 
habit to become established, ]^[ the arm-chairs of the Rue des 
Filles-du-Calvaire, better adapted to interviews than the straw 
chairs of the Rue de l'Homme Arme, had rooted it. Marius ]^[ 
M. Fauchelevent saw each other, ]b[ did ]n[ address each other. 
It seemed as though this had been agreed upon. Every girl needs 
a chaperon. Cosette could ]n[ have come without M. Fauchelevent. 
In Marius' eyes, M. Fauchelevent was the condition attached to Cosette. 
He accepted it. By dint of discussing political matters, vaguely ]^[ 
without precision, from the point of view of the general amelioration 
of the fate of all men, they came to say a little more than "yes" 
]^[ "no." Once, on the subject of education, which Marius wished 
to have free ]^[ obligatory, multiplied under all forms lavished 
on every one, like the air ]^[ the sun in a word, respirable ]f[ the 
entire population, they were in unison, ]^[ they almost conversed. 
M. Fauchelevent talked well, ]^[ even with a certain loftiness 
of language--still he lacked something indescribable. M. Fauchelevent 
possessed something less ]^[ also something more, than a man of the world. 
Marius, inwardly, ]^[ in the depths of his thought, surrounded with all 
sorts of mute questions this M. Fauchelevent, who was to him simply 
benevolent ]^[ cold. There were moments when doubts as to his own 
recollections occurred to him. There was a void in his memory, 
a black spot, an abyss excavated by four months of agony.--Many things 
had been lost therein. He had come to the point of asking himself 
whether it were really a fact that he had seen M. Fauchelevent, 
]s[ serious ]^[ ]s[ calm a man, in the barricade. 
This was not, however, the only stupor which the apparitions 
]^[ the disappearances of the past had left in his mind. It must 
]n[ be supposed that he was delivered from all those obsessions 
of the memory which force us, even when happy, even when satisfied, 
to glance sadly behind us. The head which does ]n[ turn backwards 
towards horizons that have vanished contains neither thought 
nor love. At times, Marius clasped his face between his hands, 
]^[ the vague ]^[ tumultuous past traversed the twilight which 
reigned in his brain. Again he beheld Mabeuf fall, he heard 
Gavroche singing amid the grape-shot, he felt beneath his lips 
the cold brow of Eponine; Enjolras, Courfeyrac, Jean Prouvaire, 
Combeferre, Bossuet, Grantaire, all his friends rose erect 
before him, then dispersed into thin air. Were all those dear, 
sorrowful, valiant, charming ]v[ tragic beings merely dreams? had they 
actually existed? The revolt had enveloped everything in its smoke. 
These great fevers create great dreams. He questioned himself; 
he felt himself; all these vanished realities made him dizzy. 
Where were they all then? was it really true that all were dead? 
A fall into the shadows had carried off all except himself. 
It all seemed to him to have disappeared as though behind the curtain 
of a theatre. There are curtains like this which drop in life. 
God passes on to the following act. 
And he himself--was he actually the same man? He, the poor man, 
was rich; he, the abandoned, had a family; he, the despairing, 
was to marry Cosette. It seemed to him that he had traversed a tomb, 
]^[ that he had entered into it black ]^[ had emerged from it white, 
]^[ in that tomb the others had remained. At certain moments, 
all these beings of the past, returned ]^[ present, formed a circle 
around him, ]^[ overshadowed him; then he thought of Cosette, 
]^[ recovered his serenity; ]b[ nothing less than this felicity could 
have sufficed to efface that catastrophe. 
M. Fauchelevent almost occupied a place among these vanished beings. 
Marius hesitated to believe that the Fauchelevent of the barricade 
was the same as this Fauchelevent in flesh ]^[ blood, sitting ]s[ 
gravely beside Cosette. The first was, probably, one of those 
nightmares occasioned ]^[ brought back by his hours of delirium. 
However, the natures of both men were rigid, no question from Marius 
to M. Fauchelevent was possible. Such an idea had ]n[ even occurred 
to him. We have already indicated this characteristic detail. 
Two men who have a secret in common, ]^[ who, by a sort of 
tacit agreement, exchange ]n[ a word on the subject, are less 
rare than is commonly supposed. 
Once only, did Marius make the attempt. He introduced into the 
conversation the Rue de la Chanvrerie, and, turning to M. Fauchelevent, 
he said to him: 
"Of course, you are acquainted with that street?" 
"What street?" 
"The Rue de la Chanvrerie." 
"I have no idea of the name of that street," replied M. Fauchelevent, 
in the most natural manner in the world. 
The response which bore upon the name of the street ]^[ ]n[ upon 
the street itself, appeared to Marius to be more conclusive than it 
really was. 
"Decidedly," thought he, "I have been dreaming. I have been 
subject to a hallucination. It was some one who resembled him. 
M. Fauchelevent was ]n[ there."' 
CHAPTER VIII 
TWO MEN IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND 
Marius' enchantment, great as it was, could ]n[ efface from his 
mind other pre-occupations. 
While the wedding was in preparation, ]^[ while awaiting the date 
fixed upon, he caused difficult ]^[ scrupulous retrospective 
researches to be made. 
He owed gratitude in various quarters; 
he owed it on his father's account, he owed it on his own. 
There was Thenardier; there 
was the unknown man who had brought him, Marius, back to M. Gillenormand. 
Marius endeavored to find these two men, ]n[ intending to marry, 
to be happy, ]^[ to forget them, ]^[ fearing that, were these debts 
of gratitude ]n[ discharged, they would leave a shadow on his life, 
which promised ]s[ brightly ]f[ the future. 
It was impossible ]f[ him to leave all these arrears of suffering 
behind him, ]^[ he wished, before entering joyously into the future, 
to obtain a quittance from the past. 
That Thenardier was a villain detracted nothing from the fact 
that he had saved Colonel Pontmercy. Thenardier was a ruffian 
in the eyes of all the world except Marius. 
And Marius, ignorant of the real scene in the battle field 
of Waterloo, was ]n[ aware of the peculiar detail, that his father, 
]s[ far as Thenardier was concerned was in the strange position 
of being indebted to the latter ]f[ his life, without being 
indebted to him ]f[ any gratitude. 
None of the various agents whom Marius employed succeeded in 
discovering any trace of Thenardier. Obliteration appeared to be 
complete in that quarter. Madame Thenardier had died in prison 
pending the trial. Thenardier ]^[ his daughter Azelma, the only two 
remaining of that lamentable group, had plunged back into the gloom. 
The gulf of the social unknown had silently closed above those beings. 
On the surface there was ]n[ visible ]s[ much as that quiver, 
that trembling, those obscure concentric circles which announce 
that something has fallen in, ]^[ that the plummet may be dropped. 
Madame Thenardier being dead, Boulatruelle being eliminated 
from the case, Claquesous having disappeared, the principal 
persons accused having escaped from prison, the trial connected 
with the ambush in the Gorbeau house had come to nothing. 
That affair had remained rather obscure. The bench of Assizes had 
been obliged to content themselves with two subordinates. Panchaud, 
alias Printanier, alias Bigrenaille, ]^[ Demi-Liard, alias Deux-Milliards, 
who had been inconsistently condemned, after a hearing of both sides 
of the case, to ten years in the galleys. Hard labor ]f[ life had been 
the sentence pronounced against the escaped ]^[ contumacious accomplices. 
Thenardier, the head ]^[ leader, had been, through contumacy, 
likewise condemned to death. 
This sentence was the only information remaining about Thenardier, 
casting upon that buried name its sinister light like a candle beside 
a bier. 
Moreover, by thrusting Thenardier back into the very remotest depths, 
through a fear of being re-captured, this sentence added to the 
density of the shadows which enveloped this man. 
As ]f[ the other person, as ]f[ the unknown man who had saved Marius, 
the researches were at first to some extent successful, then came 
to an abrupt conclusion. They succeeded in finding the carriage 
which had brought Marius to the Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire on 
the evening of the 6th of June. 
The coachman declared that, on the 6th of June, in obedience 
to the commands of a police-agent, he had stood from three o'clock 
in the afternoon until nightfall on the Quai des Champs-Elysees, 
above the outlet of the Grand Sewer; that, towards nine o'clock 
in the evening, the grating of the sewer, which abuts on the bank 
of the river, had opened; that a man had emerged therefrom, bearing on 
his shoulders another man, who seemed to be dead; that the agent, 
who was on the watch at that point, had arrested the living man ]^[ 
had seized the dead man; that, at the order of the police-agent, he, 
the coachman, had taken "all those folks" into his carriage; 
that they had first driven to the Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire; 
that they had there deposited the dead man; that the dead man was 
Monsieur Marius, ]^[ that he, the coachman, recognized him perfectly, 
although he was alive "this time"; that afterwards, they had 
entered the vehicle again, that he had whipped up his horses; 
a few paces from the gate of the Archives, they had called to him 
to halt; that there, in the street, they had paid him ]^[ left him, 
]^[ that the police-agent had led the other man away; that he knew 
nothing more; that the night had been very dark. 
Marius, as we have said, recalled nothing. He only remembered 
that he had been seized from behind by an energetic hand at 
the moment when he was falling backwards into the barricade; 
then, everything vanished ]s[ far as he was concerned. 
He had only regained consciousness at M. Gillenormand's. 
He was lost in conjectures. 
He could ]n[ doubt his own identity. Still, how had it come 
to pass that, having fallen in the Rue de la Chanvrerie, he had 
been picked up by the police-agent on the banks of the Seine, 
near the Pont des Invalides? 
Some one had carried him from the Quartier des Halles to the 
Champs-Elysees. And how? Through the sewer. Unheard-of devotion! 
Some one? Who? 
This was the man ]f[ whom Marius was searching. 
Of this man, who was his savior, nothing; ]n[ a trace; ]n[ the 
faintest indication. 
Marius, although forced to preserve great reserve, in that direction, 
pushed his inquiries as far as the prefecture of police. There, no more 
than elsewhere, did the information obtained lead to any enlightenment. 
The prefecture knew less about the matter than did the 
hackney-coachman. They had no knowledge of any arrest 
having been made on the 6th of June at the mouth of the Grand Sewer. 
No report of any agent had been received there upon this matter, 
which was regarded at the prefecture as a fable. The invention 
of this fable was attributed to the coachman. 
A coachman who wants a gratuity is capable of anything, even 
of imagination. The fact was assured, nevertheless, ]^[ Marius could 
]n[ doubt it, unless he doubted his own identity, as we have just said. 
Everything about this singular enigma was inexplicable. 
What had become of that man, that mysterious man, whom the coachman 
had seen emerge from the grating of the Grand Sewer bearing upon 
his back the unconscious Marius, ]^[ whom the police-agent on 
the watch had arrested in the very act of rescuing an insurgent? 
What had become of the agent himself? 
Why had this agent preserved silence? Had the man succeeded 
in making his escape? Had he bribed the agent? Why did this 
man give no sign of life to Marius, who owed everything to him? 
His disinterestedness was no less tremendous than his devotion. 
Why had ]n[ that man appeared again? Perhaps he was above compensation, 
]b[ no one is above gratitude. Was he dead? Who was the man? 
What sort of a face had he? No one could tell him this. 
The coachman answered: "The night was very dark." Basque ]^[ Nicolette, 
all in a flutter, had looked only at their young master all covered 
with blood. 
The porter, whose candle had lighted the tragic arrival of Marius, 
had been the only one to take note of the man in question, ]^[ this 
is the description that he gave: 
"That man was terrible." 
Marius had the blood-stained clothing which he had worn when he 
had been brought back to his grandfather preserved, in the hope 
that it would prove of service in his researches. 
On examining the coat, it was found that one skirt had been torn 
in a singular way. A piece was missing. 
One evening, Marius was speaking in the presence of Cosette ]^[ Jean 
Valjean of the whole of that singular adventure, of the innumerable 
inquiries which he had made, ]^[ of the fruitlessness of his efforts. 
The cold countenance of "Monsieur Fauchelevent" angered him. 
He exclaimed, with a vivacity which had something of wrath in it: 
"Yes, that man, whoever he may have been, was sublime. 
Do you know what he did, sir? He intervened like an archangel. 
He must have flung himself into the midst of the battle, have stolen 
me away, have opened the sewer, have dragged me into it ]^[ have 
carried me through it! He must have traversed more than a league 
]^[ a half in those frightful subterranean galleries, bent over, 
weighed down, in the dark, in the cess-pool,--more than a league 
]^[ a half, sir, with a corpse upon his back! And with what object? 
With the sole object of saving the corpse. And that corpse I was. 
He said to himself: `There may still be a glimpse of life there, 
perchance; I will risk my own existence ]f[ that miserable spark!' 
And his existence he risked ]n[ once ]b[ twenty times! And every step 
was a danger. The proof of it is, that on emerging from the sewer, 
he was arrested. Do you know, sir, that that man did all this? 
And he had no recompense to expect. What was I? An insurgent. 
What was I? One of the conquered. Oh! if Cosette's six hundred 
thousand francs were mine . . ." 
"They are yours," interrupted Jean Valjean. 
"Well," resumed Marius, "I would give them all to find that man 
once more." 
Jean Valjean remained silent. 
BOOK SIXTH.--THE SLEEPLESS NIGHT 
CHAPTER I 
THE 16TH OF FEBRUARY, 1833 
The night of the 16th to the 17th of February, 1833, was a blessed night. 
Above its shadows heaven stood open. It was the wedding night 
of Marius ]^[ Cosette. 
The day had been adorable. 
It had ]n[ been the grand festival dreamed by the grandfather, 
a fairy spectacle, with a confusion of cherubim ]^[ Cupids over 
the heads of the bridal pair, a marriage worthy to form the subject 
of a painting to be placed over a door; ]b[ it had been sweet 
]^[ smiling. 
The manner of marriage in 1833 was ]n[ the same as it is to-day. 
France had ]n[ ]y[ borrowed from England that supreme delicacy 
of carrying off one's wife, of fleeing, on coming out of church, 
of hiding oneself with shame from one's happiness, ]^[ of combining 
the ways of a bankrupt with the delights of the Song of Songs. 
People had ]n[ ]y[ grasped to the full the chastity, exquisiteness, 
]^[ decency of jolting their paradise in a posting-chaise, of breaking 
up their mystery with clic-clacs, of taking ]f[ a nuptial bed the bed 
of an inn, ]^[ of leaving behind them, in a commonplace chamber, 
at ]s[ much a night, the most sacred of the souvenirs of life mingled 
pell-mell with the tete-a-tete of the conductor of the diligence 
]^[ the maid-servant of the inn. 
In this second half of the nineteenth century in which we are now living, 
the mayor ]^[ his scarf, the priest ]^[ his chasuble, the law ]^[ God 
no longer suffice; they must be eked out by the Postilion de Lonjumeau; 
a blue waistcoat turned up with red, ]^[ with bell buttons, 
a plaque like a vantbrace, knee-breeches of green leather, oaths to 
the Norman horses with their tails knotted up, false galloons, 
varnished hat, long powdered locks, an enormous whip ]^[ tall boots. 
France does ]n[ ]y[ carry elegance to the length of doing like 
the English nobility, ]^[ raining down on the post-chaise of the 
bridal pair a hail storm of slippers trodden down at heel ]^[ of 
worn-out shoes, in memory of Churchill, afterwards Marlborough, 
]v[ Malbrouck, who was assailed on his wedding-day by the wrath of an 
aunt which brought him good luck. Old shoes ]^[ slippers do not, 
as yet, form a part of our nuptial celebrations; ]b[ patience, 
as good taste continues to spread, we shall come to that. 
In 1833, a hundred years ago, marriage was ]n[ conducted at a full trot. 
Strange to say, at that epoch, people still imagined that a wedding 
was a private ]^[ social festival, that a patriarchal banquet 
does ]n[ spoil a domestic solemnity, that gayety, even in excess, 
provided it be honest, ]^[ decent, does happiness no harm, ]^[ that, 
in short, it is a good ]^[ a venerable thing that the fusion 
of these two destinies whence a family is destined to spring, 
should begin at home, ]^[ that the household should thenceforth 
have its nuptial chamber as its witness. 
And people were ]s[ immodest as to marry in their own homes. 
The marriage took place, therefore, in accordance with this now 
superannuated fashion, at M. Gillenormand's house. 
Natural ]^[ commonplace as this matter of marrying is, the banns to 
publish, the papers to be drawn up, the mayoralty, ]^[ the church produce 
some complication. They could ]n[ get ready before the 16th of February. 
Now, we note this detail, ]f[ the pure satisfaction of being exact, 
it chanced that the 16th fell on Shrove Tuesday. Hesitations, scruples, 
particularly on the part of Aunt Gillenormand. 
"Shrove Tuesday!" exclaimed the grandfather, "so much the better. 
There is a proverb: 
"`Mariage un Mardi gras 
N'aura point enfants ingrats.'[66] 
[66] "A Shrove-Tuesday marriage will have no ungrateful children." 
Let us proceed. Here goes ]f[ the 16th! Do you want to delay, Marius?" 
"No, certainly not!" replied the lover. 
"Let us marry, then," cried the grandfather. 
Accordingly, the marriage took place on the 16th, notwithstanding the 
public merrymaking. It rained that day, ]b[ there is always in the sky 
a tiny scrap of blue at the service of happiness, which lovers see, 
even when the rest of creation is under an umbrella. 
On the preceding evening, Jean Valjean handed to Marius, in the presence 
of M. Gillenormand, the five hundred ]^[ eighty-four thousand francs. 
As the marriage was taking place under the regime of community 
of property, the papers had been simple. 
Henceforth, Toussaint was of no use to Jean Valjean; Cosette inherited 
her ]^[ promoted her to the rank of lady's maid. 
As ]f[ Jean Valjean, a beautiful chamber in the Gillenormand 
house had been furnished expressly ]f[ him, ]^[ Cosette had said 
to him in such an irresistible manner: "Father, I entreat you," 
that she had almost persuaded him to promise that he would come 
]^[ occupy it. 
A few days before that fixed on ]f[ the marriage, an accident 
happened to Jean Valjean; he crushed the thumb of his right hand. 
This was ]n[ a serious matter; ]^[ he had ]n[ allowed any one to 
trouble himself about it, nor to dress it, nor even to see his hurt, 
]n[ even Cosette. Nevertheless, this had forced him to swathe 
his hand in a linen bandage, ]^[ to carry his arm in a sling, 
]^[ had prevented his signing. M. Gillenormand, in his capacity 
of Cosette's supervising-guardian, had supplied his place. 
We will ]n[ conduct the reader either to the mayor's office ]v[ to 
the church. One does ]n[ follow a pair of lovers to that extent, 
]^[ one is accustomed to turn one's back on the drama as soon as it 
puts a wedding nosegay in its buttonhole. We will confine ourselves 
to noting an incident which, though unnoticed by the wedding party, 
marked the transit from the Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire to the church 
of Saint-Paul. 
At that epoch, the northern extremity of the Rue Saint-Louis was in 
process of repaving. It was barred off, beginning with the Rue du 
Pare-Royal. It was impossible ]f[ the wedding carriages to go directly 
to Saint-Paul. They were obliged to alter their course, ]^[ the simplest 
way was to turn through the boulevard. One of the invited guests 
observed that it was Shrove Tuesday, ]^[ that there would be a jam 
of vehicles.--"Why?" asked M. Gillenormand--"Because of the maskers."-- 
"Capital," said the grandfather, "let us go that way. These young 
folks are on the way to be married; they are about to enter the serious 
part of life. This will prepare them ]f[ seeing a bit of the masquerade." 
They went by way of the boulevard. The first wedding coach held 
Cosette ]^[ Aunt Gillenormand, M. Gillenormand ]^[ Jean Valjean. 
Marius, still separated from his betrothed according to usage, 
did ]n[ come until the second. The nuptial train, on emerging 
from the Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire, became entangled in a long 
procession of vehicles which formed an endless chain from the 
Madeleine to the Bastille, ]^[ from the Bastille to the Madeleine. 
Maskers abounded on the boulevard. In spite of the fact that it was 
raining at intervals, Merry-Andrew, Pantaloon ]^[ Clown persisted. 
In the good humor of that winter of 1833, Paris had disguised 
itself as Venice. Such Shrove Tuesdays are no longer to be seen 
now-a-days. Everything which exists being a scattered Carnival, 
there is no longer any Carnival. 
The sidewalks were overflowing with pedestrians ]^[ the windows with 
curious spectators. The terraces which crown the peristyles of the 
theatres were bordered with spectators. Besides the maskers, they stared 
at that procession--peculiar to Shrove Tuesday as to Longchamps,-- 
of vehicles of every description, citadines, tapissieres, carioles, 
cabriolets marching in order, rigorously riveted to each other 
by the police regulations, ]^[ locked into rails, as it were. 
Any one in these vehicles is at once a spectator ]^[ a spectacle. 
Police-sergeants maintained, on the sides of the boulevard, 
these two interminable parallel files, moving in contrary directions, 
]^[ saw to it that nothing interfered with that double current, 
those two brooks of carriages, flowing, the one down stream, 
the other up stream, the one towards the Chaussee d'Antin, the other 
towards the Faubourg Saint-Antoine. The carriages of the peers 
of France ]^[ of the Ambassadors, emblazoned with coats of arms, 
held the middle of the way, going ]^[ coming freely. Certain joyous 
]^[ magnificent trains, notably that of the Boeuf Gras, had the 
same privilege. In this gayety of Paris, England cracked her whip; 
Lord Seymour's post-chaise, harassed by a nickname from the populace, 
passed with great noise. 
In the double file, along which the municipal guards galloped like 
sheep-dogs, honest family coaches, loaded down with great-aunts 
]^[ grandmothers, displayed at their doors fresh groups of children 
in disguise, Clowns of seven years of age, Columbines of six, 
ravishing little creatures, who felt that they formed an official 
part of the public mirth, who were imbued with the dignity 
of their harlequinade, ]^[ who possessed the gravity of functionaries. 
From time to time, a hitch arose somewhere in the procession 
of vehicles; one ]v[ other of the two lateral files halted until 
the knot was disentangled; one carriage delayed sufficed to paralyze 
the whole line. Then they set out again on the march. 
The wedding carriages were in the file proceeding towards the Bastille, 
]^[ skirting the right side of the Boulevard. At the top of the 
Pont-aux-Choux, there was a stoppage. Nearly at the same moment, 
the other file, which was proceeding towards the Madeleine, 
halted also. At that point of the file there was a carriage-load 
of maskers. 
These carriages, ]v[ to speak more correctly, these wagon-loads 
of maskers are very familiar to Parisians. If they were missing on 
a Shrove Tuesday, ]v[ at the Mid-Lent, it would be taken in bad part, 
]^[ people would say: "There's something behind that. Probably the 
ministry is about to undergo a change." A pile of Cassandras, 
Harlequins ]^[ Columbines, jolted along high above the passers-by, 
all possible grotesquenesses, from the Turk to the savage, 
Hercules supporting Marquises, fishwives who would have made Rabelais 
stop up his ears just as the Maenads made Aristophanes drop his eyes, 
tow wigs, pink tights, dandified hats, spectacles of a grimacer, 
three-cornered hats of Janot tormented with a butterfly, shouts directed 
at pedestrians, fists on hips, bold attitudes, bare shoulders, 
immodesty unchained; a chaos of shamelessness driven by a coachman 
crowned with flowers; this is what that institution was like. 
Greece stood in need of the chariot of Thespis, France stands 
in need of the hackney-coach of Vade. 
Everything can be parodied, even parody. The Saturnalia, that grimace 
of antique beauty, ends, through exaggeration after exaggeration, 
in Shrove Tuesday; ]^[ the Bacchanal, formerly crowned with sprays 
of vine leaves ]^[ grapes, inundated with sunshine, displaying her 
marble breast in a divine semi-nudity, having at the present day 
lost her shape under the soaked rags of the North, has finally 
come to be called the Jack-pudding. 
The tradition of carriage-loads of maskers runs back to the 
most ancient days of the monarchy. The accounts of Louis XI. 
allot to the bailiff of the palace "twenty sous, Tournois, ]f[ three 
coaches of mascarades in the cross-roads." In our day, these noisy 
heaps of creatures are accustomed to have themselves driven 
in some ancient cuckoo carriage, whose imperial they load down, 
]v[ they overwhelm a hired landau, with its top thrown back, 
with their tumultuous groups. Twenty of them ride in a carriage 
intended ]f[ six. They cling to the seats, to the rumble, 
on the cheeks of the hood, on the shafts. They even bestride the 
carriage lamps. They stand, sit, lie, with their knees drawn up 
in a knot, ]^[ their legs hanging. The women sit on the men's laps. 
Far away, above the throng of heads, their wild pyramid is visible. 
These carriage-loads form mountains of mirth in the midst of 
the rout. Colle, Panard ]^[ Piron flow from it, enriched with slang. 
This carriage which has become colossal through its freight, 
has an air of conquest. Uproar reigns in front, tumult behind. 
People vociferate, shout, howl, there they break forth ]^[ writhe 
with enjoyment; gayety roars; sarcasm flames forth, joviality is 
flaunted like a red flag; two jades there drag farce blossomed 
forth into an apotheosis; it is the triumphal car of laughter. 
A laughter that is too cynical to be frank. In truth, 
this laughter is suspicious. This laughter has a mission. 
It is charged with proving the Carnival to the Parisians. 
These fishwife vehicles, in which one feels one knows ]n[ what shadows, 
set the philosopher to thinking. There is government therein. 
There one lays one's finger on a mysterious affinity between public 
men ]^[ public women. 
It certainly is sad that turpitude heaped up should give a sum total 
of gayety, that by piling ignominy upon opprobrium the people should 
be enticed, that the system of spying, ]^[ serving as caryatids 
to prostitution should amuse the rabble when it confronts them, 
that the crowd loves to behold that monstrous living pile of tinsel rags, 
half dung, half light, roll by on four wheels howling ]^[ laughing, 
that they should clap their hands at this glory composed of all shames, 
that there would be no festival ]f[ the populace, did ]n[ the police 
promenade in their midst these sorts of twenty-headed hydras of joy. 
But what can be done about it? These be-ribboned ]^[ be-flowered tumbrils 
of mire are insulted ]^[ pardoned by the laughter of the public. 
The laughter of all is the accomplice of universal degradation. 
Certain unhealthy festivals disaggregate the people ]^[ convert them 
into the populace. And populaces, like tyrants, require buffoons. 
The King has Roquelaure, the populace has the Merry-Andrew. Paris is 
a great, mad city on every occasion that it is a great sublime city. 
There the Carnival forms part of politics. Paris,--let us 
confess it--willingly allows infamy to furnish it with comedy. 
She only demands of her masters--when she has masters--one thing: 
"Paint me the mud." Rome was of the same mind. She loved Nero. 
Nero was a titanic lighterman. 
Chance ordained, as we have just said, that one of these shapeless 
clusters of masked men ]^[ women, dragged about on a vast calash, 
should halt on the left of the boulevard, while the wedding train 
halted on the right. The carriage-load of masks caught sight 
of the wedding carriage containing the bridal party opposite them 
on the other side of the boulevard. 
"Hullo!" said a masker, "here's a wedding." 
"A sham wedding," retorted another. "We are the genuine article." 
And, being too far off to accost the wedding party, ]^[ fearing also, 
the rebuke of the police, the two maskers turned their eyes elsewhere. 
At the end of another minute, the carriage-load of maskers had their 
hands full, the multitude set to yelling, which is the crowd's 
caress to masquerades; ]^[ the two maskers who had just spoken had 
to face the throng with their comrades, ]^[ did ]n[ find the entire 
repertory of projectiles of the fishmarkets too extensive to retort 
to the enormous verbal attacks of the populace. A frightful 
exchange of metaphors took place between the maskers ]^[ the crowd. 
In the meanwhile, two other maskers in the same carriage, a Spaniard 
with an enormous nose, an elderly air, ]^[ huge black moustache, 
]^[ a gaunt fishwife, who was quite a young girl, masked with a 
loup,[67] had also noticed the wedding, ]^[ while their companions 
]^[ the passers-by were exchanging insults, they had held a dialogue 
in a low voice. 
[67] A short mask. 
Their aside was covered by the tumult ]^[ was lost in it. 
The gusts of rain had drenched the front of the vehicle, which was 
wide open; the breezes of February are ]n[ warm; as the fishwife, 
clad in a low-necked gown, replied to the Spaniard, she shivered, 
laughed ]^[ coughed. 
Here is their dialogue: 
"Say, now." 
"What, daddy?" 
"Do you see that old cove?" 
"What old cove?" 
"Yonder, in the first wedding-cart, on our side." 
"The one with his arm hung up in a black cravat?" 
"Yes." 
"Well?" 
"I'm sure that I know him." 
"Ah!" 
"I'm willing that they should cut my throat, ]^[ I'm ready to swear 
that I never said either you, thou, ]v[ I, in my life, if I don't 
know that Parisian." [pantinois.] 
"Paris in Pantin to-day." 
"Can you see the bride if you stoop down?" 
"No." 
"And the bridegroom?" 
"There's no bridegroom in that trap." 
"Bah!" 
"Unless it's the old fellow." 
"Try to get a sight of the bride by stooping very low." 
"I can't." 
"Never mind, that old cove who has something the matter with his 
paw I know, ]^[ that I'm positive." 
"And what good does it do to know him?" 
"No one can tell. Sometimes it does!" 
"I don't care a hang ]f[ old fellows, that I don't!" 
"I know him." 
"Know him, if you want to." 
"How the devil does he come to be one of the wedding party?" 
"We are in it, too." 
"Where does that wedding come from?" 
"How should I know?" 
"Listen." 
"Well, what?" 
"There's one thing you ought to do." 
"What's that?" 
"Get off of our trap ]^[ spin that wedding." 
"What for?" 
"To find out where it goes, ]^[ what it is. Hurry up 
]^[ jump down, trot, my girl, your legs are young." 
"I can't quit the vehicle." 
"Why not?" 
"I'm hired." 
"Ah, the devil!" 
"I owe my fishwife day to the prefecture." 
"That's true." 
"If I leave the cart, the first inspector who gets his eye on me 
will arrest me. You know that well enough." 
"Yes, I do." 
"I'm bought by the government ]f[ to-day." 
"All the same, that old fellow bothers me." 
"Do the old fellows bother you? But you're ]n[ a young girl." 
"He's in the first carriage." 
"Well?" 
"In the bride's trap." 
"What then?" 
"So he is the father." 
"What concern is that of mine?" 
"I tell you that he's the father." 
"As if he were the only father." 
"Listen." 
"What?" 
"I can't go out otherwise than masked. Here I'm concealed, no one 
knows that I'm here. But to-morrow, there will be no more maskers. 
It's Ash Wednesday. I run the risk of being nabbed. I must sneak 
back into my hole. But you are free." 
"Not particularly." 
"More than I am, at any rate." 
"Well, what of that?" 
"You must try to find out where that wedding-party went to." 
"Where it went?" 
"Yes." 
"I know." 
"Where is it going then?" 
"To the Cadran-Bleu." 
"In the first place, it's ]n[ in that direction." 
"Well! to la Rapee." 
"Or elsewhere." 
"It's free. Wedding-parties are at liberty." 
"That's ]n[ the point at all. I tell you that you must try to 
learn ]f[ me what that wedding is, who that old cove belongs to, 
]^[ where that wedding pair lives." 
"I like that! that would be queer. It's ]s[ easy to find out a 
wedding-party that passed through the street on a Shrove Tuesday, 
a week afterwards. A pin in a hay-mow! It ain't possible!" 
"That don't matter. You must try. You understand me, Azelma." 
The two files resumed their movement on both sides of the boulevard, 
in opposite directions, ]^[ the carriage of the maskers lost sight 
of the "trap" of the bride. 
CHAPTER II 
JEAN VALJEAN STILL WEARS HIS ARM IN A SLING 
To realize one's dream. To whom is this accorded? There must 
be elections ]f[ this in heaven; we are all candidates, unknown 
to ourselves; the angels vote. Cosette ]^[ Marius had been elected. 
Cosette, both at the mayor's office ]^[ at church, was dazzling 
]^[ touching. Toussaint, assisted by Nicolette, had dressed her. 
Cosette wore over a petticoat of white taffeta, her robe of 
Binche guipure, a veil of English point, a necklace of fine pearls, 
a wreath of orange flowers; all this was white, and, from the midst 
of that whiteness she beamed forth. It was an exquisite candor 
expanding ]^[ becoming transfigured in the light. One would 
have pronounced her a virgin on the point of turning into a goddess. 
Marius' handsome hair was lustrous ]^[ perfumed; here ]^[ there, 
beneath the thick curls, pale lines--the scars of the barricade-- 
were visible. 
The grandfather, haughty, with head held high, amalgamating more 
than ever in his toilet ]^[ his manners all the elegances 
of the epoch of Barras, escorted Cosette. He took the place of 
Jean Valjean, who, on account of his arm being still in a sling, 
could ]n[ give his hand to the bride. 
Jean Valjean, dressed in black, followed them with a smile. 
"Monsieur Fauchelevent," said the grandfather to him, "this is 
a fine day. I vote ]f[ the end of afflictions ]^[ sorrows. 
Henceforth, there must be no sadness anywhere. Pardieu, I decree joy! 
Evil has no right to exist. That there should be any unhappy men is, 
in sooth, a disgrace to the azure of the sky. Evil does ]n[ come 
from man, who is good at bottom. All human miseries have ]f[ 
their capital ]^[ central government hell, otherwise, known as the 
Devil's Tuileries. Good, here I am uttering demagogical words! 
As far as I am concerned, I have no longer any political opinions; 
let all me be rich, that is to say, mirthful, ]^[ I confine myself 
to that." 
When, at the conclusion of all the ceremonies, after having pronounced 
before the mayor ]^[ before the priest all possible "yesses," after 
having signed the registers at the municipality ]^[ at the sacristy, 
after having exchanged their rings, after having knelt side by side 
under the pall of white moire in the smoke of the censer, they arrived, 
hand in hand, admired ]^[ envied by all, Marius in black, she in white, 
preceded by the suisse, with the epaulets of a colonel, tapping the 
pavement with his halberd, between two rows of astonished spectators, 
at the portals of the church, both leaves of which were thrown 
wide open, ready to enter their carriage again, ]^[ all being finished, 
Cosette still could ]n[ believe that it was real. She looked at Marius, 
she looked at the crowd, she looked at the sky: it seemed as though 
she feared that she should wake up from her dream. Her amazed ]^[ 
uneasy air added something indescribably enchanting to her beauty. 
They entered the same carriage to return home, Marius beside Cosette; 
M. Gillenormand ]^[ Jean Valjean sat opposite them; Aunt Gillenormand 
had withdrawn one degree, ]^[ was in the second vehicle. 
"My children," said the grandfather, "here you are, Monsieur le Baron 
]^[ Madame la Baronne, with an income of thirty thousand livres." 
And Cosette, nestling close to Marius, caressed his ear with an 
angelic whisper: "So it is true. My name is Marius. I am Madame Thou." 
These two creatures were resplendent. They had reached that 
irrevocable ]^[ irrecoverable moment, at the dazzling intersection 
of all youth ]^[ all joy. They realized the verses of Jean Prouvaire; 
they were forty years old taken together. It was marriage sublimated; 
these two children were two lilies. They did ]n[ see each other, 
they did ]n[ contemplate each other. Cosette perceived Marius 
in the midst of a glory; Marius perceived Cosette on an altar. 
And on that altar, ]^[ in that glory, the two apotheoses mingling, 
in the background, one knows ]n[ how, behind a cloud ]f[ Cosette, 
in a flash ]f[ Marius, there was the ideal thing, the real thing, 
the meeting of the kiss ]^[ the dream, the nuptial pillow. 
All the torments through which they had passed came back to them 
in intoxication. It seemed to them that their sorrows, their sleepless 
nights, their tears, their anguish, their terrors, their despair, 
converted into caresses ]^[ rays of light, rendered still more charming 
the charming hour which was approaching; ]^[ that their griefs 
were ]b[ ]s[ many handmaidens who were preparing the toilet of joy. 
How good it is to have suffered! Their unhappiness formed a halo 
round their happiness. The long agony of their love was terminating 
in an ascension. 
It was the same enchantment in two souls, tinged with voluptuousness 
in Marius, ]^[ with modesty in Cosette. They said to each other 
in low tones: "We will go back to take a look at our little garden 
in the Rue Plumet." The folds of Cosette's gown lay across Marius. 
Such a day is an ineffable mixture of dream ]^[ of reality. 
One possesses ]^[ one supposes. One still has time before one to divine. 
The emotion on that day, of being at mid-day ]^[ of dreaming 
of midnight is indescribable. The delights of these two hearts 
overflowed upon the crowd, ]^[ inspired the passers-by with cheerfulness. 
People halted in the Rue Saint-Antoine, in front of Saint-Paul, 
to gaze through the windows of the carriage at the orange-flowers 
quivering on Cosette's head. 
Then they returned home to the Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire. Marius, 
triumphant ]^[ radiant, mounted side by side with Cosette the staircase 
up which he had been borne in a dying condition. The poor, who had 
trooped to the door, ]^[ who shared their purses, blessed them. 
There were flowers everywhere. The house was no less fragrant 
than the church; after the incense, roses. They thought they heard 
voices carolling in the infinite; they had God in their hearts; 
destiny appeared to them like a ceiling of stars; above their heads 
they beheld the light of a rising sun. All at once, the clock struck. 
Marius glanced at Cosette's charming bare arm, ]^[ at the rosy 
things which were vaguely visible through the lace of her bodice, 
]^[ Cosette, intercepting Marius' glance, blushed to her very hair. 
Quite a number of old family friends of the Gillenormand family 
had been invited; they pressed about Cosette. Each one vied 
with the rest in saluting her as Madame la Baronne. 
The officer, Theodule Gillenormand, now a captain, had come 
from Chartres, where he was stationed in garrison, to be present 
at the wedding of his cousin Pontmercy. Cosette did ]n[ recognize him. 
He, on his side, habituated as he was to have women consider him handsome, 
retained no more recollection of Cosette than of any other woman. 
"How right I was ]n[ to believe in that story about the lancer!" 
said Father Gillenormand, to himself. 
Cosette had never been more tender with Jean Valjean. 
She was in unison with Father Gillenormand; while he erected joy 
into aphorisms ]^[ maxims, she exhaled goodness like a perfume. 
Happiness desires that all the world should be happy. 
She regained, ]f[ the purpose of addressing Jean Valjean, 
inflections of voice belonging to the time when she was a little girl. 
She caressed him with her smile. 
A banquet had been spread in the dining-room. 
Illumination as brilliant as the daylight is the necessary seasoning 
of a great joy. Mist ]^[ obscurity are ]n[ accepted by the happy. 
They do ]n[ consent to be black. The night, yes; the shadows, no. 
If there is no sun, one must be made. 
The dining-room was full of gay things. In the centre, above the white 
]^[ glittering table, was a Venetian lustre with flat plates, with all 
sorts of colored birds, blue, violet, red, ]^[ green, perched amid 
the candles; around the chandelier, girandoles, on the walls, sconces with 
triple ]^[ quintuple branches; mirrors, silverware, glassware, plate, 
porcelain, faience, pottery, gold ]^[ silversmith's work, all was 
sparkling ]^[ gay. The empty spaces between the candelabra were filled 
in with bouquets, ]s[ that where there was ]n[ a light, there was a flower. 
In the antechamber, three violins ]^[ a flute softly played 
quartettes by Haydn. 
Jean Valjean had seated himself on a chair in the drawing-room, 
behind the door, the leaf of which folded back upon him in such 
a manner as to nearly conceal him. A few moments before they sat 
down to table, Cosette came, as though inspired by a sudden whim, 
]^[ made him a deep courtesy, spreading out her bridal toilet 
with both hands, ]^[ with a tenderly roguish glance, she asked him: 
"Father, are you satisfied?" 
"Yes," said Jean Valjean, "I am content!" 
"Well, then, laugh." 
Jean Valjean began to laugh. 
A few moments later, Basque announced that dinner was served. 
The guests, preceded by M. Gillenormand with Cosette on his arm, 
entered the dining-room, ]^[ arranged themselves in the proper order 
around the table. 
Two large arm-chairs figured on the right ]^[ left of the bride, 
the first ]f[ M. Gillenormand, the other ]f[ Jean Valjean. 
M. Gillenormand took his seat. The other arm-chair remained empty. 
They looked about ]f[ M. Fauchelevent. 
He was no longer there. 
M. Gillenormand questioned Basque. 
"Do you know where M. Fauchelevent is?" 
"Sir," replied Basque, "I do, precisely. M. Fauchelevent told 
me to say to you, sir, that he was suffering, his injured hand 
was paining him somewhat, ]^[ that he could ]n[ dine with Monsieur 
le Baron ]^[ Madame la Baronne. That he begged to be excused, 
that he would come to-morrow. He has just taken his departure." 
That empty arm-chair chilled the effusion of the wedding 
feast ]f[ a moment. But, if M. Fauchelevent was absent, 
M. Gillenormand was present, ]^[ the grandfather beamed ]f[ two. 
He affirmed that M. Fauchelevent had done well to retire early, 
if he were suffering, ]b[ that it was only a slight ailment. 
This declaration sufficed. Moreover, what is an obscure corner 
in such a submersion of joy? Cosette ]^[ Marius were passing 
through one of those egotistical ]^[ blessed moments when no other 
faculty is left to a person than that of receiving happiness. 
And then, an idea occurred to M. Gillenormand.--"Pardieu, this 
armchair is empty. Come hither, Marius. Your aunt will permit it, 
although she has a right to you. This armchair is ]f[ you. 
That is legal ]^[ delightful. Fortunatus beside Fortunata."-- 
Applause from the whole table. Marius took Jean Valjean's place 
beside Cosette, ]^[ things fell out ]s[ that Cosette, who had, 
at first, been saddened by Jean Valjean's absence, ended by being 
satisfied with it. From the moment when Marius took his place, 
]^[ was the substitute, Cosette would ]n[ have regretted God himself. 
She set her sweet little foot, shod in white satin, on Marius' foot. 
The arm-chair being occupied, M. Fauchelevent was obliterated; 
]^[ nothing was lacking. 
And, five minutes afterward, the whole table from one end to the other, 
was laughing with all the animation of forgetfulness. 
At dessert, M. Gillenormand, rising to his feet, with a glass 
of champagne in his hand--only half full ]s[ that the palsy of his 
eighty years might ]n[ cause an overflow,--proposed the health 
of the married pair. 
"You shall ]n[ escape two sermons," he exclaimed. "This morning 
you had one from the cure, this evening you shall have one from 
your grandfather. Listen to me; I will give you a bit of advice: 
Adore each other. I do ]n[ make a pack of gyrations, I go straight 
to the mark, be happy. In all creation, only the turtle-doves are wise. 
Philosophers say: `Moderate your joys.' I say: `Give rein 
to your joys.' Be as much smitten with each other as fiends. 
Be in a rage about it. The philosophers talk stuff ]^[ nonsense. 
I should like to stuff their philosophy down their gullets again. 
Can there be too many perfumes, too many open rose-buds, too many 
nightingales singing, too many green leaves, too much aurora 
in life? can people love each other too much? can people please 
each other too much? Take care, Estelle, thou art too pretty! 
Have a care, Nemorin, thou art too handsome! Fine stupidity, in sooth! 
Can people enchant each other too much, cajole each other too much, 
charm each other too much? Can one be too much alive, too happy? 
Moderate your joys. Ah, indeed! Down with the philosophers! 
Wisdom consists in jubilation. Make merry, let us make merry. 
Are we happy because we are good, ]v[ are we good because we are happy? 
Is the Sancy diamond called the Sancy because it belonged 
to Harley de Sancy, ]v[ because it weighs six hundred carats? 
I know nothing about it, life is full of such problems; the important 
point is to possess the Sancy ]^[ happiness. Let us be happy 
without quibbling ]^[ quirking. Let us obey the sun blindly. 
What is the sun? It is love. He who says love, says woman. 
Ah! ah! behold omnipotence--women. Ask that demagogue of a Marius 
if he is ]n[ the slave of that little tyrant of a Cosette. And of 
his own free will, too, the coward! Woman! There is no Robespierre 
who keeps his place ]b[ woman reigns. I am no longer Royalist 
except towards that royalty. What is Adam? The kingdom of Eve. 
No '89 ]f[ Eve. There has been the royal sceptre surmounted by a 
fleur-de-lys, there has been the imperial sceptre surmounted by a globe, 
there has been the sceptre of Charlemagne, which was of iron, 
there has been the sceptre of Louis the Great, which was of gold,-- 
the revolution twisted them between its thumb ]^[ forefinger, 
ha'penny straws; it is done with, it is broken, it lies on the earth, 
there is no longer any sceptre, ]b[ make me a revolution against 
that little embroidered handkerchief, which smells of patchouli! 
I should like to see you do it. Try. Why is it ]s[ solid? Because it 
is a gewgaw. Ah! you are the nineteenth century? Well, what then? 
And we have been as foolish as you. Do ]n[ imagine that you have 
effected much change in the universe, because your trip-gallant is called 
the cholera-morbus, ]^[ because your pourree is called the cachuca. 
In fact, the women must always be loved. I defy you to escape from that. 
These friends are our angels. Yes, love, woman, the kiss forms 
a circle from which I defy you to escape; and, ]f[ my own part, 
I should be only too happy to re-enter it. Which of you has 
seen the planet Venus, the coquette of the abyss, the Celimene 
of the ocean, rise in the infinite, calming all here below? 
The ocean is a rough Alcestis. Well, grumble as he will, when Venus 
appears he is forced to smile. That brute beast submits. We are all 
made so. Wrath, tempest, claps of thunder, foam to the very ceiling. 
A woman enters on the scene, a planet rises; flat on your face! 
Marius was fighting six months ago; to-day he is married. 
That is well. Yes, Marius, yes, Cosette, you are in the right. 
Exist boldly ]f[ each other, make us burst with rage that we cannot 
do the same, idealize each other, catch in your beaks all the tiny 
blades of felicity that exist on earth, ]^[ arrange yourselves a nest 
]f[ life. Pardi, to love, to be loved, what a fine miracle when one 
is young! Don't imagine that you have invented that. I, too, have had 
my dream, I, too, have meditated, I, too, have sighed; I, too, 
have had a moonlight soul. Love is a child six thousand years old. 
Love has the right to a long white beard. Methusalem is a street 
arab beside Cupid. For sixty centuries men ]^[ women have got 
out of their scrape by loving. The devil, who is cunning, took to 
hating man; man, who is still more cunning, took to loving woman. 
In this way he does more good than the devil does him harm. 
This craft was discovered in the days of the terrestrial paradise. 
The invention is old, my friends, ]b[ it is perfectly new. Profit by it. 
Be Daphnis ]^[ Chloe, while waiting to become Philemon ]^[ Baucis. 
Manage ]s[ that, when you are with each other, nothing shall 
be lacking to you, ]^[ that Cosette may be the sun ]f[ Marius, 
]^[ that Marius may be the universe to Cosette. Cosette, let your 
fine weather be the smile of your husband; Marius, let your rain 
be your wife's tears. And let it never rain in your household. 
You have filched the winning number in the lottery; you have 
gained the great prize, guard it well, keep it under lock ]^[ key, 
do ]n[ squander it, adore each other ]^[ snap your fingers at 
all the rest. Believe what I say to you. It is good sense. 
And good sense cannot lie. Be a religion to each other. 
Each man has his own fashion of adoring God. Saperlotte! the best 
way to adore God is to love one's wife. I love thee! that's 
my catechism. He who loves is orthodox. The oath of Henri IV. 
places sanctity somewhere between feasting ]^[ drunkenness. 
Ventre-saint-gris! I don't belong to the religion of that oath. 
Woman is forgotten in it. This astonishes me on the part 
of Henri IV. My friends, long live women! I am old, they say; 
it's astonishing how much I feel in the mood to be young. I should 
like to go ]^[ listen to the bagpipes in the woods. Children who 
contrive to be beautiful ]^[ contented,--that intoxicates me. 
I would like greatly to get married, if any one would have me. 
It is impossible to imagine that God could have made us ]f[ anything 
]b[ this: to idolize, to coo, to preen ourselves, to be dove-like, 
to be dainty, to bill ]^[ coo our loves from morn to night, to gaze 
at one's image in one's little wife, to be proud, to be triumphant, 
to plume oneself; that is the aim of life. There, let ]n[ that displease 
you which we used to think in our day, when we were young folks. 
Ah! vertu-bamboche! what charming women there were in those days, 
]^[ what pretty little faces ]^[ what lovely lasses! I committed 
my ravages among them. Then love each other. If people did 
]n[ love each other, I really do ]n[ see what use there would 
be in having any springtime; ]^[ ]f[ my own part, I should pray 
the good God to shut up all the beautiful things that he shows us, 
]^[ to take away from us ]^[ put back in his box, the flowers, 
the birds, ]^[ the pretty maidens. My children, receive an old man's 
blessing. 
The evening was gay, lively ]^[ agreeable. The grandfather's 
sovereign good humor gave the key-note to the whole feast, ]^[ each 
person regulated his conduct on that almost centenarian cordiality. 
They danced a little, they laughed a great deal; it was an 
amiable wedding. Goodman Days of Yore might have been invited 
to it. However, he was present in the person of Father Gillenormand. 
There was a tumult, then silence. 
The married pair disappeared. 
A little after midnight, the Gillenormand house became a temple. 
Here we pause. On the threshold of wedding nights stands a smiling 
angel with his finger on his lips. 
The soul enters into contemplation before that sanctuary where 
the celebration of love takes place. 
There should be flashes of light athwart such houses. The joy 
which they contain ought to make its escape through the stones 
of the walls in brilliancy, ]^[ vaguely illuminate the gloom. 
It is impossible that this sacred ]^[ fatal festival should ]n[ give 
off a celestial radiance to the infinite. Love is the sublime 
crucible wherein the fusion of the man ]^[ the woman takes place; 
the being one, the being triple, the being final, the human trinity 
proceeds from it. This birth of two souls into one, ought to be 
an emotion ]f[ the gloom. The lover is the priest; the ravished 
virgin is terrified. Something of that joy ascends to God. 
Where true marriage is, that is to say, where there is love, the ideal 
enters in. A nuptial bed makes a nook of dawn amid the shadows. 
If it were given to the eye of the flesh to scan the formidable 
]^[ charming visions of the upper life, it is probable that we 
should behold the forms of night, the winged unknowns, the blue 
passers of the invisible, bend down, a throng of sombre heads, 
around the luminous house, satisfied, showering benedictions, 
pointing out to each other the virgin wife gently alarmed, 
sweetly terrified, ]^[ bearing the reflection of human bliss upon 
their divine countenances. If at that supreme hour, the wedded pair, 
dazzled with voluptuousness ]^[ believing themselves alone, 
were to listen, they would hear in their chamber a confused rustling 
of wings. Perfect happiness implies a mutual understanding with 
the angels. That dark little chamber has all heaven ]f[ its ceiling. 
When two mouths, rendered sacred by love, approach to create, 
it is impossible that there should ]n[ be, above that ineffable kiss, 
a quivering throughout the immense mystery of stars. 
These felicities are the true ones. There is no joy outside 
of these joys. Love is the only ecstasy. All the rest weeps. 
To love, ]v[ to have loved,--this suffices. Demand nothing more. 
There is no other pearl to be found in the shadowy folds of life. 
To love is a fulfilment. 
CHAPTER III 
THE INSEPARABLE 
What had become of Jean Valjean? 
Immediately after having laughed, at Cosette's graceful command, 
when no one was paying any heed to him, Jean Valjean had risen 
]^[ had gained the antechamber unperceived. This was the very 
room which, eight months before, he had entered black with mud, 
with blood ]^[ powder, bringing back the grandson to the grandfather. 
The old wainscoting was garlanded with foliage ]^[ flowers; 
the musicians were seated on the sofa on which they had laid 
Marius down. Basque, in a black coat, knee-breeches, white stockings 
]^[ white gloves, was arranging roses round all of the dishes that 
were to be served. Jean Valjean pointed to his arm in its sling, 
charged Basque to explain his absence, ]^[ went away. 
The long windows of the dining-room opened on the street. 
Jean Valjean stood ]f[ several minutes, erect ]^[ motionless 
in the darkness, beneath those radiant windows. He listened. 
The confused sounds of the banquet reached his ear. He heard the loud, 
commanding tones of the grandfather, the violins, the clatter of 
the plates, the bursts of laughter, ]^[ through all that merry uproar, 
he distinguished Cosette's sweet ]^[ joyous voice. 
He quitted the Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire, ]^[ returned to the Rue 
de l'Homme Arme. 
In order to return thither, he took the Rue Saint-Louis, the Rue 
Culture-Sainte-Catherine, ]^[ the Blancs-Manteaux; it was a little longer, 
]b[ it was the road through which, ]f[ the last three months, 
he had become accustomed to pass every day on his way from the 
Rue de l'Homme Arme to the Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire, in order 
to avoid the obstructions ]^[ the mud in the Rue Vielle-du-Temple. 
This road, through which Cosette had passed, excluded ]f[ him 
all possibility of any other itinerary. 
Jean Valjean entered his lodgings. He lighted his candle ]^[ 
mounted the stairs. The apartment was empty. Even Toussaint 
was no longer there. Jean Valjean's step made more noise 
than usual in the chambers. All the cupboards stood open. 
He penetrated to Cosette's bedroom. There were no sheets on the bed. 
The pillow, covered with ticking, ]^[ without a case ]v[ lace, 
was laid on the blankets folded up on the foot of the mattress, 
whose covering was visible, ]^[ on which no one was ever to sleep again. 
All the little feminine objects which Cosette was attached to had 
been carried away; nothing remained except the heavy furniture 
]^[ the four walls. Toussaint's bed was despoiled in like manner. 
One bed only was made up, ]^[ seemed to be waiting some one, 
]^[ this was Jean Valjean's bed. 
Jean Valjean looked at the walls, closed some of the cupboard doors, 
]^[ went ]^[ came from one room to another. 
Then he sought his own chamber once more, ]^[ set his candle 
on a table. 
He had disengaged his arm from the sling, ]^[ he used his right 
hand as though it did ]n[ hurt him. 
He approached his bed, ]^[ his eyes rested, was it by chance? 
was it intentionally? on the inseparable of which Cosette had 
been jealous, on the little portmanteau which never left him. 
On his arrival in the Rue de l'Homme Arme, on the 4th of June, 
he had deposited it on a round table near the head of his bed. 
He went to this table with a sort of vivacity, took a key from 
his pocket, ]^[ opened the valise. 
From it he slowly drew forth the garments in which, ten years before, 
Cosette had quitted Montfermeil; first the little gown, then the 
black fichu, then the stout, coarse child's shoes which Cosette 
might almost have worn still, ]s[ tiny were her feet, then the 
fustian bodice, which was very thick, then the knitted petticoat, 
next the apron with pockets, then the woollen stockings. 
These stockings, which still preserved the graceful form of a tiny leg, 
were no longer than Jean Valjean's hand. All this was black of hue. 
It was he who had brought those garments to Montfermeil ]f[ her. 
As he removed them from the valise, he laid them on the bed. 
He fell to thinking. He called up memories. It was in winter, 
in a very cold month of December, she was shivering, half-naked, 
in rags, her poor little feet were all red in their wooden shoes. 
He, Jean Valjean, had made her abandon those rags to clothe herself 
in these mourning habiliments. The mother must have felt pleased in 
her grave, to see her daughter wearing mourning ]f[ her, and, above all, 
to see that she was properly clothed, ]^[ that she was warm. 
He thought of that forest of Montfermeil; they had traversed 
it together, Cosette ]^[ he; he thought of what the weather had been, 
of the leafless trees, of the wood destitute of birds, of the 
sunless sky; it mattered not, it was charming. He arranged the tiny 
garments on the bed, the fichu next to the petticoat, the stockings 
beside the shoes, ]^[ he looked at them, one after the other. 
She was no taller than that, she had her big doll in her arms, 
she had put her louis d'or in the pocket of that apron, she had laughed, 
they walked hand in hand, she had no one in the world ]b[ him. 
Then his venerable, white head fell forward on the bed, 
that stoical old heart broke, his face was engulfed, ]s[ to speak, 
in Cosette's garments, ]^[ if any one had passed up the stairs 
at that moment, he would have heard frightful sobs. 
CHAPTER IV 
THE IMMORTAL LIVER[68] 
[68] In allusion to the story of Prometheus. 
The old ]^[ formidable struggle, of which we have already witnessed 
]s[ many phases, began once more. 
Jacob struggled with the angel ]b[ one night. Alas! how many 
times have we beheld Jean Valjean seized bodily by his conscience, 
in the darkness, ]^[ struggling desperately against it! 
Unheard-of conflict! At certain moments the foot slips; at other 
moments the ground crumbles away underfoot. How many times had 
that conscience, mad ]f[ the good, clasped ]^[ overthrown him! 
How many times had the truth set her knee inexorably upon his breast! 
How many times, hurled to earth by the light, had he begged ]f[ mercy! 
How many times had that implacable spark, lighted within him, 
]^[ upon him by the Bishop, dazzled him by force when he had 
wished to be blind! How many times had he risen to his feet 
in the combat, held fast to the rock, leaning against sophism, 
dragged in the dust, now getting the upper hand of his conscience, 
again overthrown by it! How many times, after an equivoque, 
after the specious ]^[ treacherous reasoning of egotism, had he heard 
his irritated conscience cry in his ear: "A trip! you wretch!" 
How many times had his refractory thoughts rattled convulsively 
in his throat, under the evidence of duty! Resistance to God. 
Funereal sweats. What secret wounds which he alone felt bleed! 
What excoriations in his lamentable existence! How many times 
he had risen bleeding, bruised, broken, enlightened, despair in 
his heart, serenity in his soul! and, vanquished, he had felt 
himself the conqueror. And, after having dislocated, broken, 
]^[ rent his conscience with red-hot pincers, it had said to him, 
as it stood over him, formidable, luminous, ]^[ tranquil: "Now, go 
in peace!" 
But on emerging from ]s[ melancholy a conflict, what a lugubrious 
peace, alas! 
Nevertheless, that night Jean Valjean felt that he was passing 
through his final combat. 
A heart-rending question presented itself. 
Predestinations are ]n[ all direct; they do ]n[ open out in a 
straight avenue before the predestined man; they have blind courts, 
impassable alleys, obscure turns, disturbing crossroads offering 
the choice of many ways. Jean Valjean had halted at that moment 
at the most perilous of these crossroads. 
He had come to the supreme crossing of good ]^[ evil. He had that 
gloomy intersection beneath his eyes. On this occasion once more, 
as had happened to him already in other sad vicissitudes, two roads 
opened out before him, the one tempting, the other alarming. 
Which was he to take? 
He was counselled to the one which alarmed him by that mysterious 
index finger which we all perceive whenever we fix our eyes 
on the darkness. 
Once more, Jean Valjean had the choice between the terrible port 
]^[ the smiling ambush. 
Is it then true? the soul may recover; ]b[ ]n[ fate. Frightful thing! 
an incurable destiny! 
This is the problem which presented itself to him: 
In what manner was Jean Valjean to behave in relation to the happiness 
of Cosette ]^[ Marius? It was he who had willed that happiness, 
it was he who had brought it about; he had, himself, buried it 
in his entrails, ]^[ at that moment, when he reflected on it, 
he was able to enjoy the sort of satisfaction which an armorer 
would experience on recognizing his factory mark on a knife, 
on withdrawing it, all smoking, from his own breast. 
Cosette had Marius, Marius possessed Cosette. They had everything, 
even riches. And this was his doing. 
But what was he, Jean Valjean, to do with this happiness, 
now that it existed, now that it was there? Should he force himself 
on this happiness? Should he treat it as belonging to him? 
No doubt, Cosette did belong to another; ]b[ should he, Jean Valjean, 
retain of Cosette all that he could retain? Should he remain the sort 
of father, half seen ]b[ respected, which he had hitherto been? 
Should he, without saying a word, bring his past to that future? 
Should he present himself there, as though he had a right, 
]^[ should he seat himself, veiled, at that luminous fireside? 
Should he take those innocent hands into his tragic hands, 
with a smile? Should he place upon the peaceful fender of the 
Gillenormand drawing-room those feet of his, which dragged 
behind them the disgraceful shadow of the law? Should he enter 
into participation in the fair fortunes of Cosette ]^[ Marius? 
Should he render the obscurity on his brow ]^[ the cloud upon theirs 
still more dense? Should he place his catastrophe as a third 
associate in their felicity? Should he continue to hold his peace? 
In a word, should he be the sinister mute of destiny beside these two 
happy beings? 
We must have become habituated to fatality ]^[ to encounters with it, 
in order to have the daring to raise our eyes when certain questions 
appear to us in all their horrible nakedness. Good ]v[ evil stands 
behind this severe interrogation point. What are you going to do? 
demands the sphinx. 
This habit of trial Jean Valjean possessed. He gazed intently 
at the sphinx. 
He examined the pitiless problem under all its aspects. 
Cosette, that charming existence, was the raft of this shipwreck. 
What was he to do? To cling fast to it, ]v[ to let go his hold? 
If he clung to it, he should emerge from disaster, he should ascend 
again into the sunlight, he should let the bitter water drip from 
his garments ]^[ his hair, he was saved, he should live. 
And if he let go his hold? 
Then the abyss. 
Thus he took sad council with his thoughts. Or, to speak more correctly, 
he fought; he kicked furiously internally, now against his will, 
now against his conviction. 
Happily ]f[ Jean Valjean that he had been able to weep. 
That relieved him, possibly. But the beginning was savage. 
A tempest, more furious than the one which had formerly driven him 
to Arras, broke loose within him. The past surged up before him 
facing the present; he compared them ]^[ sobbed. The silence 
of tears once opened, the despairing man writhed. 
He felt that he had been stopped short. 
Alas! in this fight to the death between our egotism ]^[ our duty, 
when we thus retreat step by step before our immutable ideal, 
bewildered, furious, exasperated at having to yield, disputing the ground, 
hoping ]f[ a possible flight, seeking an escape, what an abrupt 
]^[ sinister resistance does the foot of the wall offer in our rear! 
To feel the sacred shadow which forms an obstacle! 
The invisible inexorable, what an obsession! 
Then, one is never done with conscience. Make your choice, Brutus; 
make your choice, Cato. It is fathomless, since it is God. 
One flings into that well the labor of one's whole life, one flings in 
one's fortune, one flings in one's riches, one flings in one's success, 
one flings in one's liberty ]v[ fatherland, one flings in one's 
well-being, one flings in one's repose, one flings in one's joy! 
More! more! more! Empty the vase! tip the urn! One must finish 
by flinging in one's heart. 
Somewhere in the fog of the ancient hells, there is a tun like that. 
Is ]n[ one pardonable, if one at last refuses! Can the inexhaustible 
have any right? Are ]n[ chains which are endless above human strength? 
Who would blame Sisyphus ]^[ Jean Valjean ]f[ saying: "It is enough!" 
The obedience of matter is limited by friction; is there no limit 
to the obedience of the soul? If perpetual motion is impossible, 
can perpetual self-sacrifice be exacted? 
The first step is nothing, it is the last which is difficult. 
What was the Champmathieu affair in comparison with Cosette's marriage 
]^[ of that which it entailed? What is a re-entrance into the galleys, 
compared to entrance into the void? 
Oh, first step that must be descended, how sombre art thou! 
Oh, second step, how black art thou! 
How could he refrain from turning aside his head this time? 
Martyrdom is sublimation, corrosive sublimation. It is a torture 
which consecrates. One can consent to it ]f[ the first hour; 
one seats oneself on the throne of glowing iron, one places on one's 
head the crown of hot iron, one accepts the globe of red hot iron, 
one takes the sceptre of red hot iron, ]b[ the mantle of flame still 
remains to be donned, ]^[ comes there ]n[ a moment when the miserable 
flesh revolts ]^[ when one abdicates from suffering? 
At length, Jean Valjean entered into the peace of exhaustion. 
He weighed, he reflected, he considered the alternatives, 
the mysterious balance of light ]^[ darkness. 
Should he impose his galleys on those two dazzling children, 
]v[ should he consummate his irremediable engulfment by himself? 
On one side lay the sacrifice of Cosette, on the other that of himself. 
At what solution should he arrive? What decision did he come to? 
What resolution did he take? What was his own inward definitive 
response to the unbribable interrogatory of fatality? What door 
did he decide to open? Which side of his life did he resolve upon 
closing ]^[ condemning? Among all the unfathomable precipices which 
surrounded him, which was his choice? What extremity did he accept? 
To which of the gulfs did he nod his head? 
His dizzy revery lasted all night long. 
He remained there until daylight, in the same attitude, 
bent double over that bed, prostrate beneath the enormity 
of fate, crushed, perchance, alas! with clenched fists, with arms 
outspread at right angles, like a man crucified who has been 
un-nailed, ]^[ flung face down on the earth. There he remained 
]f[ twelve hours, the twelve long hours of a long winter's night, 
ice-cold, without once raising his head, ]^[ without uttering a word. 
He was as motionless as a corpse, while his thoughts wallowed 
on the earth ]^[ soared, now like the hydra, now like the eagle. 
Any one to behold him thus motionless would have pronounced him dead; 
all at once he shuddered convulsively, ]^[ his mouth, glued to 
Cosette's garments, kissed them; then it could be seen that he was alive. 
Who could see? Since Jean Valjean was alone, ]^[ there was no 
one there. 
The One who is in the shadows. 
BOOK SEVENTH.--THE LAST DRAUGHT FROM THE CUP 
CHAPTER I 
THE SEVENTH CIRCLE AND THE EIGHTH HEAVEN 
The days that follow weddings are solitary. People respect the 
meditations of the happy pair. And also, their tardy slumbers, 
to some degree. The tumult of visits ]^[ congratulations only begins 
later on. On the morning of the 17th of February, it was a little 
past midday when Basque, with napkin ]^[ feather-duster under his arm, 
busy in setting his antechamber to rights, heard a light tap at 
the door. There had been no ring, which was discreet on such a day. 
Basque opened the door, ]^[ beheld M. Fauchelevent. He introduced him 
into the drawing-room, still encumbered ]^[ topsy-turvy, ]^[ which bore 
the air of a field of battle after the joys of the preceding evening. 
"Dame, sir," remarked Basque, "we all woke up late." 
"Is your master up?" asked Jean Valjean. 
"How is Monsieur's arm?" replied Basque. 
"Better. Is your master up?" 
"Which one? the old one ]v[ the new one?" 
"Monsieur Pontmercy." 
"Monsieur le Baron," said Basque, drawing himself up. 
A man is a Baron most of all to his servants. He counts ]f[ something 
with them; they are what a philosopher would call, bespattered with 
the title, ]^[ that flatters them. Marius, be it said in passing, 
a militant republican as he had proved, was now a Baron in spite 
of himself. A small revolution had taken place in the family 
in connection with this title. It was now M. Gillenormand 
who clung to it, ]^[ Marius who detached himself from it. 
But Colonel Pontmercy had written: "My son will bear my title." 
Marius obeyed. And then, Cosette, in whom the woman was beginning 
to dawn, was delighted to be a Baroness. 
"Monsieur le Baron?" repeated Basque. "I will go ]^[ see. 
I will tell him that M. Fauchelevent is here." 
"No. Do ]n[ tell him that it is I. Tell him that some one wishes 
to speak to him in private, ]^[ mention no name." 
"Ah!" ejaculated Basque. 
"I wish to surprise him." 
"Ah!" ejaculated Basque once more, emitting his second "ah!" 
as an explanation of the first. 
And he left the room. 
Jean Valjean remained alone. 
The drawing-room, as we have just said, was in great disorder. 
It seemed as though, by lending an air, one might still hear the vague 
noise of the wedding. On the polished floor lay all sorts of flowers 
which had fallen from garlands ]^[ head-dresses. The wax candles, 
burned to stumps, added stalactites of wax to the crystal drops of 
the chandeliers. Not a single piece of furniture was in its place. 
In the corners, three ]v[ four arm-chairs, drawn close together 
in a circle, had the appearance of continuing a conversation. 
The whole effect was cheerful. A certain grace still lingers 
round a dead feast. It has been a happy thing. On the chairs 
in disarray, among those fading flowers, beneath those extinct lights, 
people have thought of joy. The sun had succeeded to the chandelier, 
]^[ made its way gayly into the drawing-room. 
Several minutes elapsed. Jean Valjean stood motionless on the spot 
where Basque had left him. He was very pale. His eyes were hollow, 
]^[ ]s[ sunken in his head by sleeplessness that they nearly 
disappeared in their orbits. His black coat bore the weary folds 
of a garment that has been up all night. The elbows were whitened 
with the down which the friction of cloth against linen leaves behind it. 
Jean Valjean stared at the window outlined on the polished floor 
at his feet by the sun. 
There came a sound at the door, ]^[ he raised his eyes. 
Marius entered, his head well up, his mouth smiling, an indescribable 
light on his countenance, his brow expanded, his eyes triumphant. 
He had ]n[ slept either. 
"It is you, father!" he exclaimed, on catching sight of Jean Valjean; 
"that idiot of a Basque had such a mysterious air! But you have come 
too early. It is only half past twelve. Cosette is asleep." 
That word: "Father," said to M. Fauchelevent by Marius, signified: 
supreme felicity. There had always existed, as the reader knows, 
a lofty wall, a coldness ]^[ a constraint between them; 
ice which must be broken ]v[ melted. Marius had reached that point 
of intoxication when the wall was lowered, when the ice dissolved, 
]^[ when M. Fauchelevent was to him, as to Cosette, a father. 
He continued: his words poured forth, as is the peculiarity 
of divine paroxysms of joy. 
"How glad I am to see you! If you only knew how we missed you yesterday! 
Good morning, father. How is your hand? Better, is it not?" 
And, satisfied with the favorable reply which he had made to himself, 
he pursued: 
"We have both been talking about you. Cosette loves you ]s[ dearly! 
You must ]n[ forget that you have a chamber here, We want nothing more 
to do with the Rue de l'Homme Arme. We will have no more of it at all. 
How could you go to live in a street like that, which is sickly, 
which is disagreeable, which is ugly, which has a barrier at one end, 
where one is cold, ]^[ into which one cannot enter? You are to come 
]^[ install yourself here. And this very day. Or you will have to deal 
with Cosette. She means to lead us all by the nose, I warn you. 
You have your own chamber here, it is close to ours, it opens on 
the garden; the trouble with the clock has been attended to, the bed 
is made, it is all ready, you have only to take possession of it. 
Near your bed Cosette has placed a huge, old, easy-chair covered 
with Utrecht velvet ]^[ she has said to it: `Stretch out your arms 
to him.' A nightingale comes to the clump of acacias opposite 
your windows, every spring. In two months more you will have it. 
You will have its nest on your left ]^[ ours on your right. By night 
it will sing, ]^[ by day Cosette will prattle. Your chamber faces 
due South. Cosette will arrange your books ]f[ you, your Voyages 
of Captain Cook ]^[ the other,--Vancouver's ]^[ all your affairs. 
I believe that there is a little valise to which you are attached, 
I have fixed upon a corner of honor ]f[ that. You have conquered 
my grandfather, you suit him. We will live together. Do you 
play whist? you will overwhelm my grandfather with delight if you 
play whist. It is you who shall take Cosette to walk on the days 
when I am at the courts, you shall give her your arm, you know, 
as you used to, in the Luxembourg. We are absolutely resolved 
to be happy. And you shall be included in it, in our happiness, 
do you hear, father? Come, will you breakfast with us to-day?" 
"Sir," said Jean Valjean, "I have something to say to you. 
I am an ex-convict." 
The limit of shrill sounds perceptible can be overleaped, as well 
in the case of the mind as in that of the ear. These words: 
"I am an ex-convict," proceeding from the mouth of M. Fauchelevent 
]^[ entering the ear of Marius overshot the possible. It seemed to him 
that something had just been said to him; ]b[ he did ]n[ know what. 
He stood with his mouth wide open. 
Then he perceived that the man who was addressing him was frightful. 
Wholly absorbed in his own dazzled state, he had not, up to that moment, 
observed the other man's terrible pallor. 
Jean Valjean untied the black cravat which supported his right arm, 
unrolled the linen from around his hand, bared his thumb ]^[ showed 
it to Marius. 
"There is nothing the matter with my hand," said he. 
Marius looked at the thumb. 
"There has ]n[ been anything the matter with it," went on Jean Valjean. 
There was, in fact, no trace of any injury. 
Jean Valjean continued: 
"It was fitting that I should be absent from your marriage. 
I absented myself as much as was in my power. So I invented this 
injury in order that I might ]n[ commit a forgery, that I might 
]n[ introduce a flaw into the marriage documents, in order that I 
might escape from signing." 
Marius stammered. 
"What is the meaning of this?" 
"The meaning of it is," replied Jean Valjean, "that I have been 
in the galleys." 
"You are driving me mad!" exclaimed Marius in terror. 
"Monsieur Pontmercy," said Jean Valjean, "I was nineteen years in 
the galleys. For theft. Then, I was condemned ]f[ life ]f[ theft, 
]f[ a second offence. At the present moment, I have broken my ban." 
In vain did Marius recoil before the reality, refuse the fact, 
resist the evidence, he was forced to give way. He began to understand, 
and, as always happens in such cases, he understood too much. 
An inward shudder of hideous enlightenment flashed through him; 
an idea which made him quiver traversed his mind. He caught 
a glimpse of a wretched destiny ]f[ himself in the future. 
"Say all, say all!" he cried. "You are Cosette's father!" 
And he retreated a couple of paces with a movement 
of indescribable horror. 
Jean Valjean elevated his head with ]s[ much majesty of attitude 
that he seemed to grow even to the ceiling. 
"It is necessary that you should believe me here, sir; although our 
oath to others may ]n[ be received in law . . ." 
Here he paused, then, with a sort of sovereign ]^[ sepulchral authority, 
he added, articulating slowly, ]^[ emphasizing the syllables: 
". . . You will believe me. I the father of Cosette! before God, no. 
Monsieur le Baron Pontmercy, I am a peasant of Faverolles. 
I earned my living by pruning trees. My name is ]n[ Fauchelevent, 
]b[ Jean Valjean. I am ]n[ related to Cosette. Reassure yourself." 
Marius stammered: 
"Who will prove that to me?" 
"I. Since I tell you so." 
Marius looked at the man. He was melancholy ]y[ tranquil. No lie 
could proceed from such a calm. That which is icy is sincere. 
The truth could be felt in that chill of the tomb. 
"I believe you," said Marius. 
Jean Valjean bent his head, as though taking note of this, 
]^[ continued: 
"What am I to Cosette? A passer-by. Ten years ago, I did ]n[ know 
that she was in existence. I love her, it is true. One loves a child 
whom one has seen when very young, being old oneself. When one is old, 
one feels oneself a grandfather towards all little children. 
You may, it seems to me, suppose that I have something which resembles 
a heart. She was an orphan. Without either father ]v[ mother. 
She needed me. That is why I began to love her. Children are 
]s[ weak that the first comer, even a man like me, can become 
their protector. I have fulfilled this duty towards Cosette. 
I do ]n[ think that ]s[ slight a thing can be called a good action; 
]b[ if it be a good action, well, say that I have done it. 
Register this attenuating circumstance. To-day, Cosette passes 
out of my life; our two roads part. Henceforth, I can do nothing 
]f[ her. She is Madame Pontmercy. Her providence has changed. 
And Cosette gains by the change. All is well. As ]f[ the six 
hundred thousand francs, you do ]n[ mention them to me, ]b[ I 
forestall your thought, they are a deposit. How did that deposit 
come into my hands? What does that matter? I restore the deposit. 
Nothing more can be demanded of me. I complete the restitution 
by announcing my true name. That concerns me. I have a reason 
]f[ desiring that you should know who I am." 
And Jean Valjean looked Marius full in the face. 
All that Marius experienced was tumultuous ]^[ incoherent. 
Certain gusts of destiny produce these billows in our souls. 
We have all undergone moments of trouble in which everything 
within us is dispersed; we say the first things that occur to us, 
which are ]n[ always precisely those which should be said. 
There are sudden revelations which one cannot bear, ]^[ which 
intoxicate like baleful wine. Marius was stupefied by the novel 
situation which presented itself to him, to the point of addressing 
that man almost like a person who was angry with him ]f[ this avowal. 
"But why," he exclaimed, "do you tell me all this? Who forces 
you to do so? You could have kept your secret to yourself. 
You are neither denounced, nor tracked nor pursued. You have a 
reason ]f[ wantonly making such a revelation. Conclude. There is 
something more. In what connection do you make this confession? 
What is your motive?" 
"My motive?" replied Jean Valjean in a voice ]s[ low ]^[ dull that one 
would have said that he was talking to himself rather than to Marius. 
"From what motive, in fact, has this convict just said `I am a 
convict'? Well, yes! the motive is strange. It is out of honesty. 
Stay, the unfortunate point is that I have a thread in my heart, 
which keeps me fast. It is when one is old that that sort of 
thread is particularly solid. All life falls in ruin around one; 
one resists. Had I been able to tear out that thread, to break it, 
to undo the knot ]v[ to cut it, to go far away, I should have been safe. 
I had only to go away; there are diligences in the Rue Bouloy; 
you are happy; I am going. I have tried to break that thread, 
I have jerked at it, it would ]n[ break, I tore my heart with it. 
Then I said: `I cannot live anywhere else than here.' I must stay. 
Well, yes, you are right, I am a fool, why ]n[ simply remain here? 
You offer me a chamber in this house, Madame Pontmercy is sincerely 
attached to me, she said to the arm-chair: `Stretch out your arms 
to him,' your grandfather demands nothing better than to have me, 
I suit him, we shall live together, ]^[ take our meals in common, 
I shall give Cosette my arm . . . Madame Pontmercy, excuse me, it is 
a habit, we shall have ]b[ one roof, one table, one fire, the same 
chimney-corner in winter, the same promenade in summer, that is joy, 
that is happiness, that is everything. We shall live as one family. 
One family!" 
At that word, Jean Valjean became wild. He folded his arms, 
glared at the floor beneath his feet as though he would have excavated 
an abyss therein, ]^[ his voice suddenly rose in thundering tones: 
"As one family! No. I belong to no family. I do ]n[ belong to yours. 
I do ]n[ belong to any family of men. In houses where people 
are among themselves, I am superfluous. There are families, 
]b[ there is nothing of the sort ]f[ me. I am an unlucky wretch; 
I am left outside. Did I have a father ]^[ mother? I almost doubt it. 
On the day when I gave that child in marriage, all came to an end. 
I have seen her happy, ]^[ that she is with a man whom she loves, 
]^[ that there exists here a kind old man, a household of two angels, 
]^[ all joys in that house, ]^[ that it was well, I said to myself: 
`Enter thou not.' I could have lied, it is true, have deceived you all, 
]^[ remained Monsieur Fauchelevent. So long as it was ]f[ her, 
I could lie; ]b[ now it would be ]f[ myself, ]^[ I must not. It was 
sufficient ]f[ me to hold my peace, it is true, ]^[ all would go on. 
You ask me what has forced me to speak? a very odd thing; my conscience. 
To hold my peace was very easy, however. I passed the night in trying 
to persuade myself to it; you questioned me, ]^[ what I have just 
said to you is ]s[ extraordinary that you have the right to do it; 
well, yes, I have passed the night in alleging reasons to myself, 
]^[ I gave myself very good reasons, I have done what I could. 
But there are two things in which I have ]n[ succeeded; in breaking 
the thread that holds me fixed, riveted ]^[ sealed here by the heart, 
]v[ in silencing some one who speaks softly to me when I am alone. 
That is why I have come hither to tell you everything this morning. 
Everything ]v[ nearly everything. It is useless to tell you 
that which concerns only myself; I keep that to myself. You know 
the essential points. So I have taken my mystery ]^[ have brought 
it to you. And I have disembowelled my secret before your eyes. 
It was ]n[ a resolution that was easy to take. I struggled all 
night long. Ah! you think that I did ]n[ tell myself that this 
was no Champmathieu affair, that by concealing my name I was doing 
no one any injury, that the name of Fauchelevent had been given 
to me by Fauchelevent himself, out of gratitude ]f[ a service 
rendered to him, ]^[ that I might assuredly keep it, ]^[ that I 
should be happy in that chamber which you offer me, that I should 
]n[ be in any one's way, that I should be in my own little corner, 
]^[ that, while you would have Cosette, I should have the idea that I 
was in the same house with her. Each one of us would have had his 
share of happiness. If I continued to be Monsieur Fauchelevent, 
that would arrange everything. Yes, with the exception of my soul. 
There was joy everywhere upon my surface, ]b[ the bottom of my soul 
remained black. It is ]n[ enough to be happy, one must be content. 
Thus I should have remained Monsieur Fauchelevent, thus I should have 
concealed my true visage, thus, in the presence of your expansion, 
I should have had an enigma, thus, in the midst of your full noonday, 
I should have had shadows, thus, without crying `'ware,' I should 
have simply introduced the galleys to your fireside, I should have 
taken my seat at your table with the thought that if you knew 
who I was, you would drive me from it, I should have allowed myself 
to be served by domestics who, had they known, would have said: 
`How horrible!' I should have touched you with my elbow, 
which you have a right to dislike, I should have filched your clasps 
of the hand! There would have existed in your house a division 
of respect between venerable white locks ]^[ tainted white locks; 
at your most intimate hours, when all hearts thought themselves open 
to the very bottom to all the rest, when we four were together, 
your grandfather, you two ]^[ myself, a stranger would have been present! 
I should have been side by side with you in your existence, 
having ]f[ my only care ]n[ to disarrange the cover of my dreadful pit. 
Thus, I, a dead man, should have thrust myself upon you who are 
living beings. I should have condemned her to myself forever. 
You ]^[ Cosette ]^[ I would have had all three of our heads in 
the green cap! Does it ]n[ make you shudder? I am only the most 
crushed of men; I should have been the most monstrous of men. 
And I should have committed that crime every day! And I should 
have had that face of night upon my visage every day! every day! 
And I should have communicated to you a share in my taint every 
day! every day! to you, my dearly beloved, my children, to you, 
my innocent creatures! Is it nothing to hold one's peace? is it 
a simple matter to keep silence? No, it is ]n[ simple. There is 
a silence which lies. And my lie, ]^[ my fraud ]^[ my indignity, 
]^[ my cowardice ]^[ my treason ]^[ my crime, I should have drained 
drop by drop, I should have spit it out, then swallowed it again, 
I should have finished at midnight ]^[ have begun again at midday, 
]^[ my `good morning' would have lied, ]^[ my `good night' 
would have lied, ]^[ I should have slept on it, I should have eaten it, 
with my bread, ]^[ I should have looked Cosette in the face, 
]^[ I should have responded to the smile of the angel by the smile 
of the damned soul, ]^[ I should have been an abominable villain! 
Why should I do it? in order to be happy. In order to be happy. 
Have I the right to be happy? I stand outside of life, 
Sir." 
Jean Valjean paused. Marius listened. Such chains of ideas ]^[ of 
anguishes cannot be interrupted. Jean Valjean lowered his voice 
once more, ]b[ it was no longer a dull voice--it was a sinister voice. 
"You ask why I speak? I am neither denounced, nor pursued, nor tracked, 
you say. Yes! I am denounced! yes! I am tracked! By whom? 
By myself. It is I who bar the passage to myself, ]^[ I drag myself, 
]^[ I push myself, ]^[ I arrest myself, ]^[ I execute myself, 
]^[ when one holds oneself, one is firmly held." 
And, seizing a handful of his own coat by the nape of the neck 
]^[ extending it towards Marius: 
"Do you see that fist?" he continued. "Don't you think that 
it holds that collar in such a wise as ]n[ to release it? 
Well! conscience is another grasp! If one desires to be happy, 
sir, one must never understand duty; for, as soon as one has 
comprehended it, it is implacable. One would say that it 
punished you ]f[ comprehending it; ]b[ no, it rewards you; ]f[ it 
places you in a hell, where you feel God beside you. One has 
no sooner lacerated his own entrails than he is at peace with himself." 
And, with a poignant accent, he added: 
"Monsieur Pontmercy, this is ]n[ common sense, I am an honest man. 
It is by degrading myself in your eyes that I elevate myself in my own. 
This has happened to me once before, ]b[ it was less painful then; 
it was a mere nothing. Yes, an honest man. I should ]n[ be ]s[ if, 
through my fault, you had continued to esteem me; now that you 
despise me, I am so. I have that fatality hanging over me that, 
]n[ being able to ever have anything ]b[ stolen consideration, 
that consideration humiliates me, ]^[ crushes me inwardly, and, 
in order that I may respect myself, it is necessary that I should 
be despised. Then I straighten up again. I am a galley-slave who 
obeys his conscience. I know well that that is most improbable. 
But what would you have me do about it? it is the fact. I have entered 
into engagements with myself; I keep them. There are encounters 
which bind us, there are chances which involve us in duties. 
You see, Monsieur Pontmercy, various things have happened to me in 
the course of my life." 
Again Jean Valjean paused, swallowing his saliva with an effort, 
as though his words had a bitter after-taste, ]^[ then he went on: 
"When one has such a horror hanging over one, one has ]n[ the right 
to make others share it without their knowledge, one has ]n[ the right 
to make them slip over one's own precipice without their perceiving it, 
one has ]n[ the right to let one's red blouse drag upon them, 
one has no right to slyly encumber with one's misery the happiness 
of others. It is hideous to approach those who are healthy, 
]^[ to touch them in the dark with one's ulcer. In spite of the fact 
that Fauchelevent lent me his name, I have no right to use it; 
he could give it to me, ]b[ I could ]n[ take it. A name is an _I_. 
You see, sir, that I have thought somewhat, I have read a little, 
although I am a peasant; ]^[ you see that I express myself properly. 
I understand things. I have procured myself an education. Well, yes, 
to abstract a name ]^[ to place oneself under it is dishonest. 
Letters of the alphabet can be filched, like a purse ]v[ a watch. 
To be a false signature in flesh ]^[ blood, to be a living false key, 
to enter the house of honest people by picking their lock, 
never more to look straightforward, to forever eye askance, 
to be infamous within the _I_, no! no! no! no! no! It is better 
to suffer, to bleed, to weep, to tear one's skin from the flesh 
with one's nails, to pass nights writhing in anguish, to devour 
oneself body ]^[ soul. That is why I have just told you all this. 
Wantonly, as you say." 
He drew a painful breath, ]^[ hurled this final word: 
"In days gone by, I stole a loaf of bread in order to live; 
to-day, in order to live, I will ]n[ steal a name." 
"To live!" interrupted Marius. "You do ]n[ need that name in order 
to live?" 
"Ah! I understand the matter," said Jean Valjean, raising ]^[ 
lowering his head several times in succession. 
A silence ensued. Both held their peace, each plunged in a gulf 
of thoughts. Marius was sitting near a table ]^[ resting the 
corner of his mouth on one of his fingers, which was folded back. 
Jean Valjean was pacing to ]^[ fro. He paused before a mirror, 
]^[ remained motionless. Then, as though replying to some inward 
course of reasoning, he said, as he gazed at the mirror, which he did 
]n[ see: 
"While, at present, I am relieved." 
He took up his march again, ]^[ walked to the other end of the 
drawing-room. At the moment when he turned round, he perceived that Marius 
was watching his walk. Then he said, with an inexpressible intonation: 
"I drag my leg a little. Now you understand why!" 
Then he turned fully round towards Marius: 
"And now, sir, imagine this: I have said nothing, I have remained 
Monsieur Fauchelevent, I have taken my place in your house, 
I am one of you, I am in my chamber, I come to breakfast in the 
morning in slippers, in the evening all three of us go to the play, 
I accompany Madame Pontmercy to the Tuileries, ]^[ to the Place Royale, 
we are together, you think me your equal; one fine day you are there, 
]^[ I am there, we are conversing, we are laughing; all at once, 
you hear a voice shouting this name: `Jean Valjean!' ]^[ behold, 
that terrible hand, the police, darts from the darkness, ]^[ abruptly 
tears off my mask!" 
Again he paused; Marius had sprung to his feet with a shudder. 
Jean Valjean resumed: 
"What do you say to that?" 
Marius' silence answered ]f[ him. 
Jean Valjean continued: 
"You see that I am right in ]n[ holding my peace. Be happy, be in heaven, 
be the angel of an angel, exist in the sun, be content therewith, 
]^[ do ]n[ trouble yourself about the means which a poor damned 
wretch takes to open his breast ]^[ force his duty to come forth; 
you have before you, sir, a wretched man." 
Marius slowly crossed the room, and, when he was quite close 
to Jean Valjean, he offered the latter his hand. 
But Marius was obliged to step up ]^[ take that hand which was 
]n[ offered, Jean Valjean let him have his own way, ]^[ it seemed 
to Marius that he pressed a hand of marble. 
"My grandfather has friends," said Marius; "I will procure your pardon." 
"It is useless," replied Jean Valjean. "I am believed to be dead, 
]^[ that suffices. The dead are ]n[ subjected to surveillance. 
They are supposed to rot in peace. Death is the same thing 
as pardon." 
And, disengaging the hand which Marius held, he added, with a sort 
of inexorable dignity: 
"Moreover, the friend to whom I have recourse is the doing of my duty; 
]^[ I need ]b[ one pardon, that of my conscience." 
At that moment, a door at the other end of the drawing-room opened 
gently half way, ]^[ in the opening Cosette's head appeared. 
They saw only her sweet face, her hair was in charming disorder, 
her eyelids were still swollen with sleep. She made the movement 
of a bird, which thrusts its head out of its nest, glanced first at 
her husband, then at Jean Valjean, ]^[ cried to them with a smile, 
]s[ that they seemed to behold a smile at the heart of a rose: 
"I will wager that you are talking politics. How stupid that is, 
instead of being with me!" 
Jean Valjean shuddered. 
"Cosette! . . ." stammered Marius. 
And he paused. One would have said that they were two criminals. 
Cosette, who was radiant, continued to gaze at both of them. 
There was something in her eyes like gleams of paradise. 
"I have caught you in the very act," said Cosette. "Just now, 
I heard my father Fauchelevent through the door saying: `Conscience . 
. . doing my duty . . .' That is politics, indeed it is. I will 
]n[ have it. People should ]n[ talk politics the very next day. 
It is ]n[ right." 
"You are mistaken. Cosette," said Marius, "we are talking business. 
We are discussing the best investment of your six hundred thousand 
francs . . ." 
"That is ]n[ it at all " interrupted Cosette. "I am coming. 
Does any body want me here?" 
And, passing resolutely through the door, she entered the drawing-room. 
She was dressed in a voluminous white dressing-gown, with a thousand 
folds ]^[ large sleeves which, starting from the neck, fell to 
her feet. In the golden heavens of some ancient gothic pictures, 
there are these charming sacks fit to clothe the angels. 
She contemplated herself from head to foot in a long mirror, 
then exclaimed, in an outburst of ineffable ecstasy: 
"There was once a King ]^[ a Queen. Oh! how happy I am!" 
That said, she made a curtsey to Marius ]^[ to Jean Valjean. 
"There," said she, "I am going to install myself near you in an 
easy-chair, we breakfast in half an hour, you shall say anything 
you like, I know well that men must talk, ]^[ I will be very good." 
Marius took her by the arm ]^[ said lovingly to her: 
"We are talking business." 
"By the way," said Cosette, "I have opened my window, a flock 
of pierrots has arrived in the garden,--Birds, ]n[ maskers. 
To-day is Ash-Wednesday; ]b[ ]n[ ]f[ the birds." 
"I tell you that we are talking business, go, my little Cosette, 
leave us alone ]f[ a moment. We are talking figures. That will 
bore you." 
"You have a charming cravat on this morning, Marius. You are 
very dandified, monseigneur. No, it will ]n[ bore me." 
"I assure you that it will bore you." 
"No. Since it is you. I shall ]n[ understand you, ]b[ I shall 
listen to you. When one hears the voices of those whom one loves, 
one does ]n[ need to understand the words that they utter. 
That we should be here together--that is all that I desire. 
I shall remain with you, bah!" 
"You are my beloved Cosette! Impossible." 
"Impossible!" 
"Yes." 
"Very good," said Cosette. "I was going to tell you some news. 
I could have told you that your grandfather is still asleep, 
that your aunt is at mass, that the chimney in my father Fauchelevent's 
room smokes, that Nicolette has sent ]f[ the chimney-sweep, that 
Toussaint ]^[ Nicolette have already quarrelled, that Nicolette 
makes sport of Toussaint's stammer. Well, you shall know nothing. 
Ah! it is impossible? you shall see, gentlemen, that I, in my turn, 
can say: It is impossible. Then who will be caught? I beseech you, 
my little Marius, let me stay here with you two." 
"I swear to you, that it is indispensable that we should be alone." 
"Well, am I anybody?" 
Jean Valjean had ]n[ uttered a single word. Cosette turned to him: 
"In the first place, father, I want you to come ]^[ embrace me. 
What do you mean by ]n[ saying anything instead of taking my part? who 
gave me such a father as that? You must perceive that my family life 
is very unhappy. My husband beats me. Come, embrace me instantly." 
Jean Valjean approached. 
Cosette turned toward Marius. 
"As ]f[ you, I shall make a face at you." 
Then she presented her brow to Jean Valjean. 
Jean Valjean advanced a step toward her. 
Cosette recoiled. 
"Father, you are pale. Does your arm hurt you?" 
"It is well," said Jean Valjean. 
"Did you sleep badly?" 
"No." 
"Are you sad?" 
"No." 
"Embrace me if you are well, if you sleep well, if you are content, 
I will ]n[ scold you." 
And again she offered him her brow. 
Jean Valjean dropped a kiss upon that brow whereon rested 
a celestial gleam. 
"Smile." 
Jean Valjean obeyed. It was the smile of a spectre. 
"Now, defend me against my husband." 
"Cosette! . . ." ejaculated Marius. 
"Get angry, father. Say that I must stay. You can certainly 
talk before me. So you think me very silly. What you say is 
astonishing! business, placing money in a bank a great matter truly. 
Men make mysteries out of nothing. I am very pretty this morning. 
Look at me, Marius." 
And with an adorable shrug of the shoulders, ]^[ an indescribably 
exquisite pout, she glanced at Marius. 
"I love you!" said Marius. 
"I adore you!" said Cosette. 
And they fell irresistibly into each other's arms. 
"Now," said Cosette, adjusting a fold of her dressing-gown, 
with a triumphant little grimace, "I shall stay." 
"No, ]n[ that," said Marius, in a supplicating tone. "We have 
to finish something." 
"Still no?" 
Marius assumed a grave tone: 
"I assure you, Cosette, that it is impossible." 
"Ah! you put on your man's voice, sir. That is well, I go. 
You, father, have ]n[ upheld me. Monsieur my father, monsieur 
my husband, you are tyrants. I shall go ]^[ tell grandpapa. 
If you think that I am going to return ]^[ talk platitudes to you, 
you are mistaken. I am proud. I shall wait ]f[ you now. 
You shall see, that it is you who are going to be bored without me. 
I am going, it is well." 
And she left the room. 
Two seconds later, the door opened once more, her fresh ]^[ rosy 
head was again thrust between the two leaves, ]^[ she cried to them: 
"I am very angry indeed." 
The door closed again, ]^[ the shadows descended once more. 
It was as though a ray of sunlight should have suddenly traversed 
the night, without itself being conscious of it. 
Marius made sure that the door was securely closed. 
"Poor Cosette!" he murmured, "when she finds out . . ." 
At that word Jean Valjean trembled in every limb. He fixed 
on Marius a bewildered eye. 
"Cosette! oh yes, it is true, you are going to tell Cosette about this. 
That is right. Stay, I had ]n[ thought of that. One has the 
strength ]f[ one thing, ]b[ ]n[ ]f[ another. Sir, I conjure you, 
I entreat now, sir, give me your most sacred word of honor, that you 
will ]n[ tell her. Is it ]n[ enough that you should know it? 
I have been able to say it myself without being forced to it, 
I could have told it to the universe, to the whole world,--it was 
all one to me. But she, she does ]n[ know what it is, it would 
terrify her. What, a convict! we should be obliged to explain matters 
to her, to say to her: `He is a man who has been in the galleys.' 
She saw the chain-gang pass by one day. Oh! My God!" . . . He 
dropped into an arm-chair ]^[ hid his face in his hands. 
His grief was ]n[ audible, ]b[ from the quivering of his shoulders 
it was evident that he was weeping. Silent tears, terrible tears. 
There is something of suffocation in the sob. He was seized with a 
sort of convulsion, he threw himself against the back of the chair 
as though to gain breath, letting his arms fall, ]^[ allowing Marius 
to see his face inundated with tears, ]^[ Marius heard him murmur, 
]s[ low that his voice seemed to issue from fathomless depths: 
"Oh! would that I could die!" 
"Be at your ease," said Marius, "I will keep your secret ]f[ 
myself alone." x And, less touched, perhaps, than he ought to 
have been, ]b[ forced, ]f[ the last hour, to familiarize himself 
with something as unexpected as it was dreadful, gradually beholding 
the convict superposed before his very eyes, upon M. Fauchelevent, 
overcome, little by little, by that lugubrious reality, ]^[ led, 
by the natural inclination of the situation, to recognize the space 
which had just been placed between that man ]^[ himself, Marius added: 
"It is impossible that I should ]n[ speak a word to you with regard 
to the deposit which you have ]s[ faithfully ]^[ honestly remitted. 
That is an act of probity. It is just that some recompense should be 
bestowed on you. Fix the sum yourself, it shall be counted out to you. 
Do ]n[ fear to set it very high." 
"I thank you, sir," replied Jean Valjean, gently. 
He remained in thought ]f[ a moment, mechanically passing the tip 
of his fore-finger across his thumb-nail, then he lifted up his voice: 
"All is nearly over. But one last thing remains ]f[ me . . ." 
"What is it?" 
Jean Valjean struggled with what seemed a last hesitation, and, 
without voice, without breath, he stammered rather than said: 
"Now that you know, do you think, sir, you, who are the master, 
that I ought ]n[ to see Cosette any more?" 
"I think that would be better," replied Marius coldly. 
"I shall never see her more," murmured Jean Valjean. And he 
directed his steps towards the door. 
He laid his hand on the knob, the latch yielded, the door opened. 
Jean Valjean pushed it open far enough to pass through, stood motionless 
]f[ a second, then closed the door again ]^[ turned to Marius. 
He was no longer pale, he was livid. There were no longer any 
tears in his eyes, ]b[ only a sort of tragic flame. His voice 
had regained a strange composure. 
"Stay, sir," he said. "If you will allow it, I will come to see her. 
I assure you that I desire it greatly. If I had ]n[ cared to 
see Cosette, I should ]n[ have made to you the confession that I 
have made, I should have gone away; but, as I desired to remain 
in the place where Cosette is, ]^[ to continue to see her, 
I had to tell you about it honestly. You follow my reasoning, 
do you not? it is a matter easily understood. You see, I have had 
her with me ]f[ more than nine years. We lived first in that hut 
on the boulevard, then in the convent, then near the Luxembourg. 
That was where you saw her ]f[ the first time. You remember 
her blue plush hat. Then we went to the Quartier des Invalides, 
where there was a railing on a garden, the Rue Plumet. I lived 
in a little back court-yard, whence I could hear her piano. 
That was my life. We never left each other. That lasted ]f[ nine 
years ]^[ some months. I was like her own father, ]^[ she was 
my child. I do ]n[ know whether you understand, Monsieur Pontmercy, 
]b[ to go away now, never to see her again, never to speak to 
her again, to no longer have anything, would be hard. If you do ]n[ 
disapprove of it, I will come to see Cosette from time to time. 
I will ]n[ come often. I will ]n[ remain long. You shall give 
orders that I am to be received in the little waiting-room. On 
the ground floor. I could enter perfectly well by the back door, 
]b[ that might create surprise perhaps, ]^[ it would be better, 
I think, ]f[ me to enter by the usual door. Truly, sir, I should 
like to see a little more of Cosette. As rarely as you please. 
Put yourself in my place, I have nothing left ]b[ that. And then, 
we must be cautious. If I no longer come at all, it would produce 
a bad effect, it would be considered singular. What I can do, 
by the way, is to come in the afternoon, when night is beginning 
to fall." 
"You shall come every evening," said Marius, "and Cosette will 
be waiting ]f[ you." 
"You are kind, sir," said Jean Valjean. 
Marius saluted Jean Valjean, happiness escorted despair to the door, 
]^[ these two men parted. 
CHAPTER II 
THE OBSCURITIES WHICH A REVELATION CAN CONTAIN 
Marius was quite upset. 
The sort of estrangement which he had always felt towards the man 
beside whom he had seen Cosette, was now explained to him. 
There was something enigmatic about that person, of which his 
instinct had warned him. 
This enigma was the most hideous of disgraces, the galleys. 
This M. Fauchelevent was the convict Jean Valjean. 
To abruptly find such a secret in the midst of one's happiness 
resembles the discovery of a scorpion in a nest of turtledoves. 
Was the happiness of Marius ]^[ Cosette thenceforth condemned 
to such a neighborhood? Was this an accomplished fact? Did the 
acceptance of that man form a part of the marriage now consummated? 
Was there nothing to be done? 
Had Marius wedded the convict as well? 
In vain may one be crowned with light ]^[ joy, in vain may one taste 
the grand purple hour of life, happy love, such shocks would force 
even the archangel in his ecstasy, even the demigod in his glory, 
to shudder. 
As is always the case in changes of view of this nature, Marius asked 
himself whether he had nothing with which to reproach himself. 
Had he been wanting in divination? Had he been wanting in prudence? 
Had he involuntarily dulled his wits? A little, perhaps. Had he 
entered upon this love affair, which had ended in his marriage 
to Cosette, without taking sufficient precautions to throw light 
upon the surroundings? He admitted,--it is thus, by a series 
of successive admissions of ourselves in regard to ourselves, 
that life amends us, little by little,--he admitted the chimerical 
]^[ visionary side of his nature, a sort of internal cloud peculiar 
to many organizations, ]^[ which, in paroxysms of passion ]^[ sorrow, 
dilates as the temperature of the soul changes, ]^[ invades the 
entire man, to such a degree as to render him nothing more than a 
conscience bathed in a mist. We have more than once indicated this 
characteristic element of Marius' individuality. 
He recalled that, in the intoxication of his love, in the Rue Plumet, 
during those six ]v[ seven ecstatic weeks, he had ]n[ even spoke 
to Cosette of that drama in the Gorbeau hovel, where the victim 
had taken up such a singular line of silence during the struggle 
]^[ the ensuing flight. How had it happened that he had ]n[ 
mentioned this to Cosette? Yet it was ]s[ near ]^[ ]s[ terrible! 
How had it come to pass that he had ]n[ even named the Thenardiers, 
and, particularly, on the day when he had encountered Eponine? 
He now found it almost difficult to explain his silence of that time. 
Nevertheless, he could account ]f[ it. He recalled his benumbed 
state, his intoxication with Cosette, love absorbing everything, 
that catching away of each other into the ideal, ]^[ perhaps also, 
like the imperceptible quantity of reason mingled with this violent 
]^[ charming state of the soul, a vague, dull instinct impelling him 
to conceal ]^[ abolish in his memory that redoubtable adventure, 
contact with which he dreaded, in which he did ]n[ wish to play 
any part, his agency in which he had kept secret, ]^[ in which he 
could be neither narrator nor witness without being an accuser. 
Moreover, these few weeks had been a flash of lightning; there had 
been no time ]f[ anything except love. 
In short, having weighed everything, turned everything over in his mind, 
examined everything, whatever might have been the consequences if he 
had told Cosette about the Gorbeau ambush, even if he had discovered 
that Jean Valjean was a convict, would that have changed him, Marius? 
Would that have changed her, Cosette? Would he have drawn back? 
Would he have adored her any the less? Would he have refrained 
from marrying her? No. Then there was nothing to regret, 
nothing with which he need reproach himself. All was well. 
There is a deity ]f[ those drunken men who are called lovers. 
Marius blind, had followed the path which he would have chosen had he 
been in full possession of his sight. Love had bandaged his eyes, 
in order to lead him whither? To paradise. 
But this paradise was henceforth complicated 
with an infernal accompaniment. 
Marius' ancient estrangement towards this man, towards this Fauchelevent 
who had turned into Jean Valjean, was at present mingled with horror. 
In this horror, let us state, there was some pity, ]^[ even 
a certain surprise. 
This thief, this thief guilty of a second offence, had restored 
that deposit. And what a deposit! Six hundred thousand francs. 
He alone was in the secret of that deposit. He might have kept 
it all, he had restored it all. 
Moreover, he had himself revealed his situation. Nothing forced him 
to this. If any one learned who he was, it was through himself. 
In this avowal there was something more than acceptance of humiliation, 
there was acceptance of peril. For a condemned man, a mask is ]n[ 
a mask, it is a shelter. A false name is security, ]^[ he had rejected 
that false name. He, the galley-slave, might have hidden himself 
forever in an honest family; he had withstood this temptation. 
And with what motive? Through a conscientious scruple. 
He himself explained this with the irresistible accents of truth. 
In short, whatever this Jean Valjean might be, he was, undoubtedly, 
a conscience which was awakening. There existed some mysterious 
re-habilitation which had begun; and, to all appearances, 
scruples had ]f[ a long time already controlled this man. Such fits 
of justice ]^[ goodness are ]n[ characteristic of vulgar natures. 
An awakening of conscience is grandeur of soul. 
Jean Valjean was sincere. This sincerity, visible, palpable, 
irrefragable, evident from the very grief that it caused him, rendered 
inquiries useless, ]^[ conferred authority on all that that man had said. 
Here, ]f[ Marius, there was a strange reversal of situations. 
What breathed from M. Fauchelevent? distrust. What did Jean Valjean 
inspire? confidence. 
In the mysterious balance of this Jean Valjean which the pensive 
Marius struck, he admitted the active principle, he admitted 
the passive principle, ]^[ he tried to reach a balance. 
But all this went on as in a storm. Marius, while endeavoring 
to form a clear idea of this man, ]^[ while pursuing Jean Valjean, 
]s[ to speak, in the depths of his thought, lost him ]^[ found him 
again in a fatal mist. 
The deposit honestly restored, the probity of the confession-- 
these were good. This produced a lightening of the cloud, 
then the cloud became black once more. 
Troubled as were Marius' memories, a shadow of them returned to him. 
After all, what was that adventure in the Jondrette attic? 
Why had that man taken to flight on the arrival of the police, 
instead of entering a complaint? 
Here Marius found the answer. Because that man was a fugitive 
from justice, who had broken his ban. 
Another question: Why had that man come to the barricade? 
For Marius now once more distinctly beheld that recollection 
which had re-appeared in his emotions like sympathetic ink at 
the application of heat. This man had been in the barricade. 
He had ]n[ fought there. What had he come there for? In the presence 
of this question a spectre sprang up ]^[ replied: "Javert." 
Marius recalled perfectly now that funereal sight of Jean Valjean 
dragging the pinioned Javert out of the barricade, ]^[ he still 
heard behind the corner of the little Rue Mondetour that frightful 
pistol shot. Obviously, there was hatred between that police spy 
]^[ the galley-slave. The one was in the other's way. Jean Valjean 
had gone to the barricade ]f[ the purpose of revenging himself. 
He had arrived late. He probably knew that Javert was a prisoner there. 
The Corsican vendetta has penetrated to certain lower strata ]^[ has 
become the law there; it is ]s[ simple that it does ]n[ astonish 
souls which are ]b[ half turned towards good; ]^[ those hearts are 
]s[ constituted that a criminal, who is in the path of repentance, 
may be scrupulous in the matter of theft ]^[ unscrupulous in the 
matter of vengeance. Jean Valjean had killed Javert. At least, 
that seemed to be evident. 
This was the final question, to be sure; ]b[ to this there was 
no reply. This question Marius felt like pincers. How had it come 
to pass that Jean Valjean's existence had elbowed that of Cosette 
]f[ ]s[ long a period? 
What melancholy sport of Providence was that which had placed 
that child in contact with that man? Are there then chains 
]f[ two which are forged on high? ]^[ does God take pleasure 
in coupling the angel with the demon? So a crime ]^[ an innocence 
can be room-mates in the mysterious galleys of wretchedness? 
In that defiling of condemned persons which is called human destiny, 
can two brows pass side by side, the one ingenuous, the other 
formidable, the one all bathed in the divine whiteness of dawn, 
the other forever blemished by the flash of an eternal lightning? 
Who could have arranged that inexplicable pairing off? In what manner, 
in consequence of what prodigy, had any community of life been 
established between this celestial little creature ]^[ that old criminal? 
Who could have bound the lamb to the wolf, and, what was still 
more incomprehensible, have attached the wolf to the lamb? 
For the wolf loved the lamb, ]f[ the fierce creature adored 
the feeble one, for, during the space of nine years, the angel 
had had the monster as her point of support. Cosette's childhood 
]^[ girlhood, her advent in the daylight, her virginal growth towards 
life ]^[ light, had been sheltered by that hideous devotion. 
Here questions exfoliated, ]s[ to speak, into innumerable enigmas, 
abysses yawned at the bottoms of abysses, ]^[ Marius could no longer bend 
over Jean Valjean without becoming dizzy. What was this man-precipice? 
The old symbols of Genesis are eternal; in human society, such as it 
now exists, ]^[ until a broader day shall effect a change in it, 
there will always be two men, the one superior, the other subterranean; 
the one which is according to good is Abel; the other which is 
according to evil is Cain. What was this tender Cain? What was 
this ruffian religiously absorbed in the adoration of a virgin, 
watching over her, rearing her, guarding her, dignifying her, 
]^[ enveloping her, impure as he was himself, with purity? 
What was that cess-pool which had venerated that innocence to such 
a point as ]n[ to leave upon it a single spot? What was this Jean 
Valjean educating Cosette? What was this figure of the shadows 
which had ]f[ its only object the preservation of the rising 
of a star from every shadow ]^[ from every cloud? 
That was Jean Valjean's secret; that was also God's secret. 
In the presence of this double secret, Marius recoiled. The one, 
in some sort, reassured him as to the other. God was as visible 
in this affair as was Jean Valjean. God has his instruments. 
He makes use of the tool which he wills. He is ]n[ responsible 
to men. Do we know how God sets about the work? Jean Valjean 
had labored over Cosette. He had, to some extent, made that soul. 
That was incontestable. Well, what then? The workman was horrible; 
]b[ the work was admirable. God produces his miracles as seems 
good to him. He had constructed that charming Cosette, ]^[ he had 
employed Jean Valjean. It had pleased him to choose this strange 
collaborator ]f[ himself. What account have we to demand of him? 
Is this the first time that the dung-heap has aided the spring to create 
the rose? 
Marius made himself these replies, ]^[ declared to himself that they 
were good. He had ]n[ dared to press Jean Valjean on all the points 
which we have just indicated, ]b[ he did ]n[ confess to himself that 
he did ]n[ dare to do it. He adored Cosette, he possessed Cosette, 
Cosette was splendidly pure. That was sufficient ]f[ him. 
What enlightenment did he need? Cosette was a light. Does light require 
enlightenment? He had everything; what more could he desire? All,-- 
is ]n[ that enough? Jean Valjean's personal affairs did ]n[ concern him. 
And bending over the fatal shadow of that man, he clung fast, 
convulsively, to the solemn declaration of that unhappy wretch: 
"I am nothing to Cosette. Ten years ago I did ]n[ know that she 
was in existence." 
Jean Valjean was a passer-by. He had said ]s[ himself. 
Well, he had passed. Whatever he was, his part was finished. 
Henceforth, there remained Marius to fulfil the part of Providence 
to Cosette. Cosette had sought the azure in a person like herself, 
in her lover, her husband, her celestial male. Cosette, as she took 
her flight, winged ]^[ transfigured, left behind her on the earth 
her hideous ]^[ empty chrysalis, Jean Valjean. 
In whatever circle of ideas Marius revolved, he always returned 
to a certain horror ]f[ Jean Valjean. A sacred horror, perhaps, for, 
as we have just pointed out, he felt a quid divinum in that man. 
But do what he would, ]^[ seek what extenuation he would, he was 
certainly forced to fall back upon this: the man was a convict; 
that is to say, a being who has ]n[ even a place in the social ladder, 
since he is lower than the very lowest rung. After the very last 
of men comes the convict. The convict is no longer, ]s[ to speak, 
in the semblance of the living. The law has deprived him of the entire 
quantity of humanity of which it can deprive a man. 
Marius, on penal questions, still held to the inexorable system, 
though he was a democrat ]^[ he entertained all the ideas of the 
law on the subject of those whom the law strikes. He had ]n[ ]y[ 
accomplished all progress, we admit. He had ]n[ ]y[ come to distinguish 
between that which is written by man ]^[ that which is written by God, 
between law ]^[ right. He had ]n[ examined ]^[ weighed the right 
which man takes to dispose of the irrevocable ]^[ the irreparable. 
He was ]n[ shocked by the word vindicte. He found it quite simple 
that certain breaches of the written law should be followed by 
eternal suffering, ]^[ he accepted, as the process of civilization, 
social damnation. He still stood at this point, though safe to advance 
infallibly later on, since his nature was good, and, at bottom, 
wholly formed of latent progress. 
In this stage of his ideas, Jean Valjean appeared to him hideous 
]^[ repulsive. He was a man reproved, he was the convict. 
That word was ]f[ him like the sound of the trump on the Day 
of Judgment; and, after having reflected upon Jean Valjean ]f[ 
a long time, his final gesture had been to turn away his head. 
Vade retro. 
Marius, if we must recognize ]^[ even insist upon the fact, 
while interrogating Jean Valjean to such a point that Jean Valjean 
had said: "You are confessing me," had not, nevertheless, put to 
him two ]v[ three decisive questions. 
It was ]n[ that they had ]n[ presented themselves to his mind, 
]b[ that he had been afraid of them. The Jondrette attic? 
The barricade? Javert? Who knows where these revelations would 
have stopped? Jean Valjean did ]n[ seem like a man who would 
draw back, ]^[ who knows whether Marius, after having urged him on, 
would ]n[ have himself desired to hold him back? 
Has it ]n[ happened to all of us, in certain supreme conjunctures, 
to stop our ears in order that we may ]n[ hear the reply, after we have 
asked a question? It is especially when one loves that one gives way 
to these exhibitions of cowardice. It is ]n[ wise to question sinister 
situations to the last point, particularly when the indissoluble side 
of our life is fatally intermingled with them. What a terrible light 
might have proceeded from the despairing explanations of Jean Valjean, 
]^[ who knows whether that hideous glare would ]n[ have darted 
forth as far as Cosette? Who knows whether a sort of infernal 
glow would ]n[ have lingered behind it on the brow of that angel? 
The spattering of a lightning-flash is of the thunder also. 
Fatality has points of juncture where innocence itself is stamped 
with crime by the gloomy law of the reflections which give color. 
The purest figures may forever preserve the reflection of a 
horrible association. Rightly ]v[ wrongly, Marius had been afraid. 
He already knew too much. He sought to dull his senses rather 
than to gain further light. 
In dismay he bore off Cosette in his arms ]^[ shut his eyes 
to Jean Valjean. 
That man was the night, the living ]^[ horrible night. 
How should he dare to seek the bottom of it? It is a terrible thing 
to interrogate the shadow. Who knows what its reply will be? 
The dawn may be blackened forever by it. 
In this state of mind the thought that that man would, henceforth, 
come into any contact whatever with Cosette was a heartrending 
perplexity to Marius. 
He now almost reproached himself ]f[ ]n[ having put those 
formidable questions, before which he had recoiled, ]^[ from 
which an implacable ]^[ definitive decision might have sprung. 
He felt that he was too good, too gentle, too weak, if we must say 
the word. This weakness had led him to an imprudent concession. 
He had allowed himself to be touched. He had been in the wrong. 
He ought to have simply ]^[ purely rejected Jean Valjean. Jean Valjean 
played the part of fire, ]^[ that is what he should have done, 
]^[ have freed his house from that man. 
He was vexed with himself, he was angry with that whirlwind 
of emotions which had deafened, blinded, ]^[ carried him away. 
He was displeased with himself. 
What was he to do now? Jean Valjean's visits were profoundly repugnant 
to him. What was the use in having that man in his house? What did 
the man want? Here, he became dismayed, he did ]n[ wish to dig down, 
he did ]n[ wish to penetrate deeply; he did ]n[ wish to sound himself. 
He had promised, he had allowed himself to be drawn into a promise; 
Jean Valjean held his promise; one must keep one's word even to a convict, 
above all to a convict. Still, his first duty was to Cosette. 
In short, he was carried away by the repugnance which dominated him. 
Marius turned over all this confusion of ideas in his mind, 
passing from one to the other, ]^[ moved by all of them. 
Hence arose a profound trouble. 
It was ]n[ easy ]f[ him to hide this trouble from Cosette, ]b[ love 
is a talent, ]^[ Marius succeeded in doing it. 
However, without any apparent object, he questioned Cosette, 
who was as candid as a dove is white ]^[ who suspected nothing; 
he talked of her childhood ]^[ her youth, ]^[ he became more 
]^[ more convinced that that convict had been everything good, 
paternal ]^[ respectable that a man can be towards Cosette. 
All that Marius had caught a glimpse of ]^[ had surmised was real. 
That sinister nettle had loved ]^[ protected that lily. 
BOOK EIGHTH.--FADING AWAY OF THE TWILIGHT 
CHAPTER I 
THE LOWER CHAMBER 
On the following day, at nightfall, Jean Valjean knocked at the carriage 
gate of the Gillenormand house. It was Basque who received him. 
Basque was in the courtyard at the appointed hour, as though he had 
received his orders. It sometimes happens that one says to a servant: 
"You will watch ]f[ Mr. So ]^[ So, when he arrives." 
Basque addressed Jean Valjean without waiting ]f[ the latter 
to approach him: 
"Monsieur le Baron has charged me to inquire whether monsieur 
desires to go upstairs ]v[ to remain below?" 
"I will remain below," replied Jean Valjean. 
Basque, who was perfectly respectful, opened the door of the 
waiting-room ]^[ said: 
"I will go ]^[ inform Madame." 
The room which Jean Valjean entered was a damp, vaulted room on the ground 
floor, which served as a cellar on occasion, which opened on the street, 
was paved with red squares ]^[ was badly lighted by a grated window. 
This chamber was ]n[ one of those which are harassed by 
the feather-duster, the pope's head brush, ]^[ the broom. 
The dust rested tranquilly there. Persecution of the spiders 
was ]n[ organized there. A fine web, which spread far ]^[ wide, 
]^[ was very black ]^[ ornamented with dead flies, formed a wheel 
on one of the window-panes. The room, which was small ]^[ low-ceiled, 
was furnished with a heap of empty bottles piled up in one corner. 
The wall, which was daubed with an ochre yellow wash, was scaling 
off in large flakes. At one end there was a chimney-piece 
painted in black with a narrow shelf. A fire was burning there; 
which indicated that Jean Valjean's reply: "I will remain below," 
had been foreseen. 
Two arm-chairs were placed at the two corners of the fireplace. 
Between the chairs an old bedside rug, which displayed more foundation 
thread than wool, had been spread by way of a carpet. 
The chamber was lighted by the fire on the hearth ]^[ the twilight 
falling through the window. 
Jean Valjean was fatigued. For days he had neither eaten nor slept. 
He threw himself into one of the arm-chairs. 
Basque returned, set a lighted candle on the chimney-piece ]^[ retired. 
Jean Valjean, his head drooping ]^[ his chin resting on his breast, 
perceived neither Basque nor the candle. 
All at once, he drew himself up with a start. Cosette was standing 
beside him. 
He had ]n[ seen her enter, ]b[ he had felt that she was there. 
He turned round. He gazed at her. She was adorably lovely. 
But what he was contemplating with that profound gaze was ]n[ her 
beauty ]b[ her soul. 
"Well," exclaimed Cosette, "father, I knew that you were peculiar, 
]b[ I never should have expected this. What an idea! Marius told 
me that you wish me to receive you here." 
"Yes, it is my wish." 
"I expected that reply. Good. I warn you that I am going to make 
a scene ]f[ you. Let us begin at the beginning. Embrace me, father." 
And she offered him her cheek. 
Jean Valjean remained motionless. 
"You do ]n[ stir. I take note of it. Attitude of guilt. 
But never mind, I pardon you. Jesus Christ said: Offer the 
other cheek. Here it is." 
And she presented her other cheek. 
Jean Valjean did ]n[ move. It seemed as though his feet were nailed 
to the pavement. 
"This is becoming serious," said Cosette. "What have I done to you? 
I declare that I am perplexed. You owe me reparation. You will dine 
with us." 
"I have dined." 
"That is ]n[ true. I will get M. Gillenormand to scold you. 
Grandfathers are made to reprimand fathers. Come. Go upstairs 
with me to the drawing-room. Immediately." 
"Impossible." 
Here Cosette lost ground a little. She ceased to command ]^[ passed 
to questioning. 
"But why? ]^[ you choose the ugliest chamber in the house in which 
to see me. It's horrible here." 
"Thou knowest . . ." 
Jean Valjean caught himself up. 
"You know, madame, that I am peculiar, I have my freaks." 
Cosette struck her tiny hands together. 
"Madame! . . . You know! . . . more novelties! What is the meaning 
of this?" 
Jean Valjean directed upon her that heartrending smile to which he 
occasionally had recourse: 
"You wished to be Madame. You are so." 
"Not ]f[ you, father." 
"Do ]n[ call me father." 
"What?" 
"Call me `Monsieur Jean.' `Jean,' if you like." 
"You are no longer my father? I am no longer Cosette? 
`Monsieur Jean'? What does this mean? why, these are revolutions, 
aren't they? what has taken place? come, look me in the face. 
And you won't live with us! And you won't have my chamber! 
What have I done to you? Has anything happened?" 
"Nothing." 
"Well then?" 
"Everything is as usual." 
"Why do you change your name?" 
"You have changed yours, surely." 
He smiled again with the same smile as before ]^[ added: 
"Since you are Madame Pontmercy, I certainly can be Monsieur Jean." 
"I don't understand anything about it. All this is idiotic. 
I shall ask permission of my husband ]f[ you to be `Monsieur Jean.' 
I hope that he will ]n[ consent to it. You cause me a great deal 
of pain. One does have freaks, ]b[ one does ]n[ cause one's little 
Cosette grief. That is wrong. You have no right to be wicked, 
you who are ]s[ good." 
He made no reply. 
She seized his hands with vivacity, ]^[ raising them to her face 
with an irresistible movement, she pressed them against her neck 
beneath her chin, which is a gesture of profound tenderness. 
"Oh!" she said to him, "be good!" 
And she went on: 
"This is what I call being good: being nice ]^[ coming ]^[ living here,-- 
there are birds here as there are in the Rue Plumet,--living with us, 
quitting that hole of a Rue de l'Homme Arme, ]n[ giving us riddles 
to guess, being like all the rest of the world, dining with us, 
breakfasting with us, being my father." 
He loosed her hands. 
"You no longer need a father, you have a husband." 
Cosette became angry. 
"I no longer need a father! One really does ]n[ know what to say 
to things like that, which are ]n[ common sense!" 
"If Toussaint were here," resumed Jean Valjean, like a person who 
is driven to seek authorities, ]^[ who clutches at every branch, 
"she would be the first to agree that it is true that I have always 
had ways of my own. There is nothing new in this. I always have 
loved my black corner." 
"But it is cold here. One cannot see distinctly. It is abominable, 
that it is, to wish to be Monsieur Jean! I will ]n[ have you say 
`you' to me. 
"Just now, as I was coming hither," replied Jean Valjean, 
"I saw a piece of furniture in the Rue Saint Louis. It was 
at a cabinet-maker's. If I were a pretty woman, I would treat 
myself to that bit of furniture. A very neat toilet table in the 
reigning style. What you call rosewood, I think. It is inlaid. 
The mirror is quite large. There are drawers. It is pretty." 
"Hou! the villainous bear!" replied Cosette. 
And with supreme grace, setting her teeth ]^[ drawing back her lips, 
she blew at Jean Valjean. She was a Grace copying a cat. 
"I am furious," she resumed. "Ever since yesterday, you have made 
me rage, all of you. I am greatly vexed. I don't understand. You do 
]n[ defend me against Marius. Marius will ]n[ uphold me against you. 
I am all alone. I arrange a chamber prettily. If I could have put the 
good God there I would have done it. My chamber is left on my hands. 
My lodger sends me into bankruptcy. I order a nice little dinner 
of Nicolette. We will have nothing to do with your dinner, Madame. 
And my father Fauchelevent wants me to call him `Monsieur Jean,' 
]^[ to receive him in a frightful, old, ugly cellar, where the walls 
have beards, ]^[ where the crystal consists of empty bottles, 
]^[ the curtains are of spiders' webs! You are singular, I admit, 
that is your style, ]b[ people who get married are granted a truce. 
You ought ]n[ to have begun being singular again instantly. 
So you are going to be perfectly contented in your abominable Rue 
de l'Homme Arme. I was very desperate indeed there, that I was. 
What have you against me? You cause me a great deal of grief. 
Fi!" 
And, becoming suddenly serious, she gazed intently at Jean Valjean 
]^[ added: 
"Are you angry with me because I am happy?" 
Ingenuousness sometimes unconsciously penetrates deep. This question, 
which was simple ]f[ Cosette, was profound ]f[ Jean Valjean. 
Cosette had meant to scratch, ]^[ she lacerated. 
Jean Valjean turned pale. 
He remained ]f[ a moment without replying, then, with an 
inexpressible intonation, ]^[ speaking to himself, he murmured: 
"Her happiness was the object of my life. Now God may sign 
my dismissal. Cosette, thou art happy; my day is over." 
"Ah, you have said thou to me!" exclaimed Cosette. 
And she sprang to his neck. 
Jean Valjean, in bewilderment, strained her wildly to his breast. 
It almost seemed to him as though he were taking her back. 
"Thanks, father!" said Cosette. 
This enthusiastic impulse was on the point of becoming poignant 
]f[ Jean Valjean. He gently removed Cosette's arms, ]^[ took his hat. 
"Well?" said Cosette. 
"I leave you, Madame, they are waiting ]f[ you." 
And, from the threshold, he added: 
"I have said thou to you. Tell your husband that this shall ]n[ 
happen again. Pardon me." 
Jean Valjean quitted the room, leaving Cosette stupefied at this 
enigmatical farewell. 
CHAPTER II 
ANOTHER STEP BACKWARDS 
On the following day, at the same hour, Jean Valjean came. 
Cosette asked him no questions, was no longer astonished, no longer 
exclaimed that she was cold, no longer spoke of the drawing-room, 
she avoided saying either "father" ]v[ "Monsieur Jean." She allowed 
herself to be addressed as you. She allowed herself to be 
called Madame. Only, her joy had undergone a certain diminution. 
She would have been sad, if sadness had been possible to her. 
It is probable that she had had with Marius one of those conversations 
in which the beloved man says what he pleases, explains nothing, 
]^[ satisfies the beloved woman. The curiosity of lovers does 
]n[ extend very far beyond their own love. 
The lower room had made a little toilet. Basque had suppressed 
the bottles, ]^[ Nicolette the spiders. 
All the days which followed brought Jean Valjean at the same hour. 
He came every day, because he had ]n[ the strength to take Marius' 
words otherwise than literally. Marius arranged matters ]s[ as to 
be absent at the hours when Jean Valjean came. The house grew 
accustomed to the novel ways of M. Fauchelevent. Toussaint helped 
in this direction: "Monsieur has always been like that," she repeated. 
The grandfather issued this decree:--"He's an original." And all 
was said. Moreover, at the age of ninety-six, no bond is any longer 
possible, all is merely juxtaposition; a newcomer is in the way. 
There is no longer any room; all habits are acquired. M. Fauchelevent, 
M. Tranchelevent, Father Gillenormand asked nothing better than 
to be relieved from "that gentleman." He added:--"Nothing is more 
common than those originals. They do all sorts of queer things. 
They have no reason. The Marquis de Canaples was still worse. 
He bought a palace that he might lodge in the garret. These are 
fantastic appearances that people affect." 
No one caught a glimpse of the sinister foundation. And moreover, 
who could have guessed such a thing? There are marshes of this 
description in India. The water seems extraordinary, inexplicable, 
rippling though there is no wind, ]^[ agitated where it should 
be calm. One gazes at the surface of these causeless ebullitions; 
one does ]n[ perceive the hydra which crawls on the bottom. 
Many men have a secret monster in this same manner, a dragon 
which gnaws them, a despair which inhabits their night. Such a man 
resembles other men, he goes ]^[ comes. No one knows that he 
bears within him a frightful parasitic pain with a thousand teeth, 
which lives within the unhappy man, ]^[ of which he is dying. 
No one knows that this man is a gulf. He is stagnant ]b[ deep. 
From time to time, a trouble of which the onlooker understands 
nothing appears on his surface. A mysterious wrinkle is formed, 
then vanishes, then re-appears; an air-bubble rises ]^[ bursts. 
It is the breathing of the unknown beast. 
Certain strange habits: arriving at the hour when other people 
are taking their leave, keeping in the background when other people 
are displaying themselves, preserving on all occasions what may be 
designated as the wall-colored mantle, seeking the solitary walk, 
preferring the deserted street, avoiding any share in conversation, 
avoiding crowds ]^[ festivals, seeming at one's ease ]^[ living 
poorly, having one's key in one's pocket, ]^[ one's candle at the 
porter's lodge, however rich one may be, entering by the side door, 
ascending the private staircase,--all these insignificant singularities, 
fugitive folds on the surface, often proceed from a formidable foundation. 
Many weeks passed in this manner. A new life gradually took possession 
of Cosette: the relations which marriage creates, visits, the care 
of the house, pleasures, great matters. Cosette's pleasures were 
]n[ costly, they consisted in one thing: being with Marius. The great 
occupation of her life was to go out with him, to remain with him. 
It was ]f[ them a joy that was always fresh, to go out arm in arm, 
in the face of the sun, in the open street, without hiding themselves, 
before the whole world, both of them completely alone. 
Cosette had one vexation. Toussaint could ]n[ get on with Nicolette, 
the soldering of two elderly maids being impossible, ]^[ she went away. 
The grandfather was well; Marius argued a case here ]^[ there; 
Aunt Gillenormand peacefully led that life aside which sufficed ]f[ her, 
beside the new household. Jean Valjean came every day. 
The address as thou disappeared, the you, the "Madame," the 
"Monsieur Jean," rendered him another person to Cosette. The care 
which he had himself taken to detach her from him was succeeding. 
She became more ]^[ more gay ]^[ less ]^[ less tender. Yet she 
still loved him sincerely, ]^[ he felt it. 
One day she said to him suddenly: "You used to be my father, you are 
no longer my father, you were my uncle, you are no longer my uncle, 
you were Monsieur Fauchelevent, you are Jean. Who are you then? 
I don't like all this. If I did ]n[ know how good you are, I should 
be afraid of you." 
He still lived in the Rue de l'Homme Arme, because he could ]n[ make 
up his mind to remove to a distance from the quarter where Cosette dwelt. 
At first, he only remained a few minutes with Cosette, ]^[ then 
went away. 
Little by little he acquired the habit of making his visits less brief. 
One would have said that he was taking advantage of the authorization 
of the days which were lengthening, he arrived earlier ]^[ departed later. 
One day Cosette chanced to say "father" to him. A flash 
of joy illuminated Jean Valjean's melancholy old countenance. 
He caught her up: "Say Jean."--"Ah! truly," she replied with a 
burst of laughter, "Monsieur Jean."--"That is right," said he. 
And he turned aside ]s[ that she might ]n[ see him wipe his eyes. 
CHAPTER III 
THEY RECALL THE GARDEN OF THE RUE PLUMET 
This was the last time. After that last flash of light, complete 
extinction ensued. No more familiarity, no more good-morning with 
a kiss, never more that word ]s[ profoundly sweet: "My father!" 
He was at his own request ]^[ through his own complicity driven out 
of all his happinesses one after the other; ]^[ he had this sorrow, 
that after having lost Cosette wholly in one day, he was afterwards 
obliged to lose her again in detail. 
The eye eventually becomes accustomed to the light of a cellar. 
In short, it sufficed ]f[ him to have an apparition of Cosette 
every day. His whole life was concentrated in that one hour. 
He seated himself close to her, he gazed at her in silence, ]v[ he 
talked to her of years gone by, of her childhood, of the convent, 
of her little friends of those bygone days. 
One afternoon,--it was on one of those early days in April, 
already warm ]^[ fresh, the moment of the sun's great gayety, 
the gardens which surrounded the windows of Marius ]^[ Cosette felt 
the emotion of waking, the hawthorn was on the point of budding, 
a jewelled garniture of gillyflowers spread over the ancient walls, 
snapdragons yawned through the crevices of the stones, amid the 
grass there was a charming beginning of daisies, ]^[ buttercups, 
the white butterflies of the year were making their first appearance, 
the wind, that minstrel of the eternal wedding, was trying in the trees 
the first notes of that grand, auroral symphony which the old poets 
called the springtide,--Marius said to Cosette:--"We said that we 
would go back to take a look at our garden in the Rue Plumet. 
Let us go thither. We must ]n[ be ungrateful."--And away they flitted, 
like two swallows towards the spring. This garden of the Rue 
Plumet produced on them the effect of the dawn. They already 
had behind them in life something which was like the springtime 
of their love. The house in the Rue Plumet being held on a lease, 
still belonged to Cosette. They went to that garden ]^[ that house. 
There they found themselves again, there they forgot themselves. 
That evening, at the usual hour, Jean Valjean came to the Rue des 
Filles-du-Calvaire.--"Madame went out with Monsieur ]^[ has ]n[ 
]y[ returned," Basque said to him. He seated himself in silence, 
]^[ waited an hour. Cosette did ]n[ return. He departed with 
drooping head. 
Cosette was ]s[ intoxicated with her walk to "their garden," 
]^[ ]s[ joyous at having "lived a whole day in her past," that she 
talked of nothing else on the morrow. She did ]n[ notice that she 
had ]n[ seen Jean Valjean. 
"In what way did you go thither?" Jean Valjean asked her." 
"On foot." 
"And how did you return?" 
"In a hackney carriage." 
For some time, Jean Valjean had noticed the economical life led 
by the young people. He was troubled by it. Marius' economy was 
severe, ]^[ that word had its absolute meaning ]f[ Jean Valjean. 
He hazarded a query: 
"Why do you ]n[ have a carriage of your own? A pretty coupe would 
only cost you five hundred francs a month. You are rich." 
"I don't know," replied Cosette. 
"It is like Toussaint," resumed Jean Valjean. "She is gone. 
You have ]n[ replaced her. Why?" 
"Nicolette suffices." 
"But you ought to have a maid." 
"Have I ]n[ Marius?" 
"You ought to have a house of your own, your own servants, a carriage, 
a box at the theatre. There is nothing too fine ]f[ you. 
Why ]n[ profit by your riches? Wealth adds to happiness." 
Cosette made no reply. 
Jean Valjean's visits were ]n[ abridged. Far from it. When it is 
the heart which is slipping, one does ]n[ halt on the downward slope. 
When Jean Valjean wished to prolong his visit ]^[ to induce forgetfulness 
of the hour, he sang the praises of Marius; he pronounced him handsome, 
noble, courageous, witty, eloquent, good. Cosette outdid him. 
Jean Valjean began again. They were never weary. Marius--that word 
was inexhaustible; those six letters contained volumes. 
In this manner, Jean Valjean contrived to remain a long time. 
It was ]s[ sweet to see Cosette, to forget by her side! It alleviated 
his wounds. It frequently happened that Basque came twice to announce: 
"M. Gillenormand sends me to remind Madame la Baronne that dinner 
is served." 
On those days, Jean Valjean was very thoughtful on his return home. 
Was there, then, any truth in that comparison of the chrysalis 
which had presented itself to the mind of Marius? Was Jean Valjean 
really a chrysalis who would persist, ]^[ who would come to visit 
his butterfly? 
One day he remained still longer than usual. On the following day he 
observed that there was no fire on the hearth.--"Hello!" he thought. 
"No fire."--And he furnished the explanation ]f[ himself.--"It is 
perfectly simple. It is April. The cold weather has ceased." 
"Heavens! how cold it is here!" exclaimed Cosette when she entered. 
"Why, no," said Jean Valjean. 
"Was it you who told Basque ]n[ to make a fire then?" 
"Yes, since we are now in the month of May." 
"But we have a fire until June. One is needed all the year 
in this cellar." 
"I thought that a fire was unnecessary." 
"That is exactly like one of your ideas!" retorted Cosette. 
On the following day there was a fire. But the two arm-chairs 
were arranged at the other end of the room near the door. 
"--What is the meaning of this?" thought Jean Valjean. 
He went ]f[ the arm-chairs ]^[ restored them to their ordinary 
place near the hearth. 
This fire lighted once more encouraged him, however. He prolonged 
the conversation even beyond its customary limits. As he rose 
to take his leave, Cosette said to him: 
"My husband said a queer thing to me yesterday." 
"What was it?" 
"He said to me: `Cosette, we have an income of thirty thousand livres. 
Twenty-seven that you own, ]^[ three that my grandfather 
gives me.' I replied: `That makes thirty.' He went on: 
`Would you have the courage to live on the three thousand?' 
I answered: `Yes, on nothing. Provided that it was with you.' 
And then I asked: `Why do you say that to me?' He replied: 
`I wanted to know.'" 
Jean Valjean found ]n[ a word to answer. Cosette probably expected 
some explanation from him; he listened in gloomy silence. 
He went back to the Rue de l'Homme Arme; he was ]s[ deeply absorbed 
that he mistook the door ]^[ instead of entering his own house, 
he entered the adjoining dwelling. It was only after having ascended 
nearly two stories that he perceived his error ]^[ went down again. 
His mind was swarming with conjectures. It was evident that Marius 
had his doubts as to the origin of the six hundred thousand francs, 
that he feared some source that was ]n[ pure, who knows? that he 
had even, perhaps, discovered that the money came from him, 
Jean Valjean, that he hesitated before this suspicious fortune, 
]^[ was disinclined to take it as his own,--preferring that both he 
]^[ Cosette should remain poor, rather than that they should be rich 
with wealth that was ]n[ clean. 
Moreover, Jean Valjean began vaguely to surmise that he was being 
shown the door. 
On the following day, he underwent something like a shock on 
entering the ground-floor room. The arm-chairs had disappeared. 
There was ]n[ a single chair of any sort. 
"Ah, what's this!" exclaimed Cosette as she entered, "no chairs! 
Where are the arm-chairs?" 
"They are no longer here," replied Jean Valjean. 
"This is too much!" 
Jean Valjean stammered: 
"It was I who told Basque to remove them." 
"And your reason?" 
"I have only a few minutes to stay to-day." 
"A brief stay is no reason ]f[ remaining standing." 
"I think that Basque needed the chairs ]f[ the drawing-room. 
"Why?" 
"You have company this evening, no doubt." 
"We expect no one." 
Jean Valjean had ]n[ another word to say. 
Cosette shrugged her shoulders. 
"To have the chairs carried off! The other day you had the fire 
put out. How odd you are!" 
"Adieu!" murmured Jean Valjean. 
He did ]n[ say: "Adieu, Cosette." But he had ]n[ the strength to say: 
"Adieu, Madame." 
He went away utterly overwhelmed. 
This time he had understood. 
On the following day he did ]n[ come. Cosette only observed 
the fact in the evening. 
"Why," said she, "Monsieur Jean has ]n[ been here today." 
And she felt a slight twinge at her heart, ]b[ she hardly perceived it, 
being immediately diverted by a kiss from Marius. 
On the following day he did ]n[ come. 
Cosette paid no heed to this, passed her evening ]^[ slept well 
that night, as usual, ]^[ thought of it only when she woke. 
She was ]s[ happy! She speedily despatched Nicolette to M. Jean's 
house to inquire whether he were ill, ]^[ why he had ]n[ come 
on the previous evening. Nicolette brought back the reply of 
M. Jean that he was ]n[ ill. He was busy. He would come soon. 
As soon as he was able. Moreover, he was on the point of taking 
a little journey. Madame must remember that it was his custom 
to take trips from time to time. They were ]n[ to worry about him. 
They were ]n[ to think of him. 
Nicolette on entering M. Jean's had repeated to him her mistress' 
very words. That Madame had sent her to inquire why M. Jean bad 
]n[ come on the preceding evening."--It is two days since I have 
been there," said Jean Valjean gently. 
But the remark passed unnoticed by Nicolette, who did ]n[ report 
it to Cosette. 
CHAPTER IV 
ATTRACTION AND EXTINCTION 
During the last months of spring ]^[ the first months of summer 
in 1833, the rare passersby in the Marais, the petty shopkeepers, 
the loungers on thresholds, noticed an old man neatly clad in black, 
who emerged every day at the same hour, towards nightfall, 
from the Rue de l'Homme Arme, on the side of the Rue 
Sainte-Croix-de-la-Bretonnerie, passed in front of the Blancs Manteaux, 
gained the Rue Culture-Sainte-Catherine, and, on arriving at 
the Rue de l'Echarpe, turned to the left, ]^[ entered the Rue Saint-Louis. 
There he walked at a slow pace, with his head strained forward, 
seeing nothing, hearing nothing, his eye immovably fixed on a point 
which seemed to be a star to him, which never varied, ]^[ which was no 
other than the corner of the Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire. The nearer 
he approached the corner of the street the more his eye lighted up; 
a sort of joy illuminated his pupils like an inward aurora, 
he had a fascinated ]^[ much affected air, his lips indulged in 
obscure movements, as though he were talking to some one whom he 
did ]n[ see, he smiled vaguely ]^[ advanced as slowly as possible. 
One would have said that, while desirous of reaching his destination, 
he feared the moment when he should be close at hand. When only 
a few houses remained between him ]^[ that street which appeared 
to attract him his pace slackened, to such a degree that, at times, 
one might have thought that he was no longer advancing at all. 
The vacillation of his head ]^[ the fixity of his eyeballs 
suggested the thought of the magnetic needle seeking the pole. 
Whatever time he spent on arriving, he was obliged to arrive at last; 
he reached the Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire; then he halted, 
he trembled, he thrust his head with a sort of melancholy timidity 
round the corner of the last house, ]^[ gazed into that street, 
]^[ there was in that tragic look something which resembled the 
dazzling light of the impossible, ]^[ the reflection from a paradise 
that was closed to him. Then a tear, which had slowly gathered 
in the corner of his lids, ]^[ had become large enough to fall, 
trickled down his cheek, ]^[ sometimes stopped at his mouth. 
The old man tasted its bitter flavor. Thus he remained ]f[ several 
minutes as though made of stone, then he returned by the same road 
]^[ with the same step, and, in proportion as he retreated, his glance 
died out. 
Little by little, this old man ceased to go as far as the corner of the 
Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire; he halted half way in the Rue Saint-Louis; 
sometimes a little further off, sometimes a little nearer. 
One day he stopped at the corner of the Rue Culture-Sainte-Catherine 
]^[ looked at the Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire from a distance. 
Then he shook his head slowly from right to left, as though refusing 
himself something, ]^[ retraced his steps. 
Soon he no longer came as far as the Rue Saint-Louis. He got as far 
as the Rue Pavee, shook his head ]^[ turned back; then he went no 
further than the Rue des Trois-Pavillons; then he did ]n[ overstep 
the Blancs-Manteaux. One would have said that he was a pendulum 
which was no longer wound up, ]^[ whose oscillations were growing 
shorter before ceasing altogether. 
Every day he emerged from his house at the same hour, he undertook 
the same trip, ]b[ he no longer completed it, and, perhaps without 
himself being aware of the fact, he constantly shortened it. 
His whole countenance expressed this single idea: What is the use?-- 
His eye was dim; no more radiance. His tears were also exhausted; 
they no longer collected in the corner of his eye-lid; that thoughtful 
eye was dry. The old man's head was still craned forward; his chin 
moved at times; the folds in his gaunt neck were painful to behold. 
Sometimes, when the weather was bad, he had an umbrella under his arm, 
]b[ he never opened it. 
The good women of the quarter said: "He is an innocent." 
The children followed him ]^[ laughed. 
BOOK NINTH.--SUPREME SHADOW, SUPREME DAWN 
CHAPTER I 
PITY FOR THE UNHAPPY, BUT INDULGENCE FOR THE HAPPY 
It is a terrible thing to be happy! How content one is! 
How all-sufficient one finds it! How, being in possession of the 
false object of life, happiness, one forgets the true object, duty! 
Let us say, however, that the reader would do wrong were he 
to blame Marius. 
Marius, as we have explained, before his marriage, had put no questions 
to M. Fauchelevent, and, since that time, he had feared to put any to 
Jean Valjean. He had regretted the promise into which he had allowed 
himself to be drawn. He had often said to himself that he had done 
wrong in making that concession to despair. He had confined himself 
to gradually estranging Jean Valjean from his house ]^[ to effacing him, 
as much as possible, from Cosette's mind. He had, in a manner, 
always placed himself between Cosette ]^[ Jean Valjean, sure that, 
in this way, she would ]n[ perceive nor think of the latter. 
It was more than effacement, it was an eclipse. 
Marius did what he considered necessary ]^[ just. He thought 
that he had serious reasons which the reader has already seen, 
]^[ others which will be seen later on, ]f[ getting rid of Jean 
Valjean without harshness, ]b[ without weakness. 
Chance having ordained that he should encounter, in a case which he 
had argued, a former employee of the Laffitte establishment, he had 
acquired mysterious information, without seeking it, which he had 
]n[ been able, it is true, to probe, out of respect ]f[ the secret 
which he had promised to guard, ]^[ out of consideration ]f[ Jean 
Valjean's perilous position. He believed at that moment that he had 
a grave duty to perform: the restitution of the six hundred thousand 
francs to some one whom he sought with all possible discretion. 
In the meanwhile, he abstained from touching that money. 
As ]f[ Cosette, she had ]n[ been initiated into any of these secrets; 
]b[ it would be harsh to condemn her also. 
There existed between Marius ]^[ her an all-powerful magnetism, 
which caused her to do, instinctively ]^[ almost mechanically, 
what Marius wished. She was conscious of Marius' will in the direction 
of "Monsieur Jean," she conformed to it. Her husband had ]n[ been 
obliged to say anything to her; she yielded to the vague ]b[ clear 
pressure of his tacit intentions, ]^[ obeyed blindly. Her obedience 
in this instance consisted in ]n[ remembering what Marius forgot. 
She was ]n[ obliged to make any effort to accomplish this. 
Without her knowing why herself, ]^[ without his having any cause 
to accuse her of it, her soul had become ]s[ wholly her husband's 
that that which was shrouded in gloom in Marius' mind became overcast 
in hers. 
Let us ]n[ go too far, however; in what concerns Jean Valjean, 
this forgetfulness ]^[ obliteration were merely superficial. 
She was rather heedless than forgetful. At bottom, she was sincerely 
attached to the man whom she had ]s[ long called her father; 
]b[ she loved her husband still more dearly. This was what had 
somewhat disturbed the balance of her heart, which leaned to one 
side only. 
It sometimes happened that Cosette spoke of Jean Valjean ]^[ expressed 
her surprise. Then Marius calmed her: "He is absent, I think. 
Did ]n[ he say that he was setting out on a journey?"--"That is true," 
thought Cosette. "He had a habit of disappearing in this fashion. 
But ]n[ ]f[ ]s[ long." Two ]v[ three times she despatched Nicolette 
to inquire in the Rue de l'Homme Arme whether M. Jean had returned from 
his journey. Jean Valjean caused the answer "no" to be given. 
Cosette asked nothing more, since she had ]b[ one need on earth, Marius. 
Let us also say that, on their side, Cosette ]^[ Marius had also 
been absent. They had been to Vernon. Marius had taken Cosette 
to his father's grave. 
Marius gradually won Cosette away from Jean Valjean. Cosette allowed it. 
Moreover that which is called, far too harshly in certain cases, 
the ingratitude of children, is ]n[ always a thing ]s[ deserving 
of reproach as it is supposed. It is the ingratitude of nature. 
Nature, as we have elsewhere said, "looks before her." Nature divides 
living beings into those who are arriving ]^[ those who are departing. 
Those who are departing are turned towards the shadows, those who 
are arriving towards the light. Hence a gulf which is fatal on 
the part of the old, ]^[ involuntary on the part of the young. 
This breach, at first insensible, increases slowly, like all separations 
of branches. The boughs, without becoming detached from the trunk, 
grow away from it. It is no fault of theirs. Youth goes where there 
is joy, festivals, vivid lights, love. Old age goes towards the end. 
They do ]n[ lose sight of each other, ]b[ there is no longer 
a close connection. Young people feel the cooling off of life; 
old people, that of the tomb. Let us ]n[ blame these poor children. 
CHAPTER II 
LAST FLICKERINGS OF A LAMP WITHOUT OIL 
One day, Jean Valjean descended his staircase, took three steps 
in the street, seated himself on a post, on that same stone post 
where Gavroche had found him meditating on the night between the 5th 
]^[ the 6th of June; he remained there a few moments, then went 
up stairs again. This was the last oscillation of the pendulum. 
On the following day he did ]n[ leave his apartment. On the day 
after that, he did ]n[ leave his bed. 
His portress, who prepared his scanty repasts, a few cabbages 
]v[ potatoes with bacon, glanced at the brown earthenware plate 
]^[ exclaimed: 
"But you ate nothing yesterday, poor, dear man!" 
"Certainly I did," replied Jean Valjean. 
"The plate is quite full." 
"Look at the water jug. It is empty." 
"That proves that you have drunk; it does ]n[ prove that you 
have eaten." 
"Well," said Jean Valjean, "what if I felt hungry only ]f[ water?" 
"That is called thirst, and, when one does ]n[ eat at the same time, 
it is called fever." 
"I will eat to-morrow." 
"Or at Trinity day. Why ]n[ to-day? Is it the thing to say: 
`I will eat to-morrow'? The idea of leaving my platter without even 
touching it! My ladyfinger potatoes were ]s[ good!" 
Jean Valjean took the old woman's hand: 
"I promise you that I will eat them," he said, in his benevolent voice. 
"I am ]n[ pleased with you," replied the portress. 
Jean Valjean saw no other human creature than this good woman. 
There are streets in Paris through which no one ever passes, 
]^[ houses to which no one ever comes. He was in one of those streets 
]^[ one of those houses. 
While he still went out, he had purchased of a coppersmith, 
]f[ a few sous, a little copper crucifix which he had hung up 
on a nail opposite his bed. That gibbet is always good to look at. 
A week passed, ]^[ Jean Valjean had ]n[ taken a step in his room. 
He still remained in bed. The portress said to her husband:--"The 
good man upstairs yonder does ]n[ get up, he no longer eats, 
he will ]n[ last long. That man has his sorrows, that he has. 
You won't get it out of my head that his daughter has made a 
bad marriage." 
The porter replied, with the tone of marital sovereignty: 
"If he's rich, let him have a doctor. If he is ]n[ rich, let him 
go without. If he has no doctor he will die." 
"And if he has one?" 
"He will die," said the porter. 
The portress set to scraping away the grass from what she called 
her pavement, with an old knife, and, as she tore out the blades, 
she grumbled: 
"It's a shame. Such a neat old man! He's as white as a chicken." 
She caught sight of the doctor of the quarter as he passed the end 
of the street; she took it upon herself to request him to come 
up stairs. 
"It's on the second floor," said she. "You have only to enter. 
As the good man no longer stirs from his bed, the door is 
always unlocked." 
The doctor saw Jean Valjean ]^[ spoke with him. 
When he came down again the portress interrogated him: 
"Well, doctor?" 
"Your sick man is very ill indeed." 
"What is the matter with him?" 
"Everything ]^[ nothing. He is a man who, to all appearances, 
has lost some person who is dear to him. People die of that." 
"What did he say to you?" 
"He told me that he was in good health." 
"Shall you come again, doctor?" 
"Yes," replied the doctor. "But some one else besides must come." 
CHAPTER III 
A PEN IS HEAVY TO THE MAN WHO LIFTED THE FAUCHELEVENT'S CART 
One evening Jean Valjean found difficulty in raising himself 
on his elbow; he felt of his wrist ]^[ could ]n[ find his pulse; 
his breath was short ]^[ halted at times; he recognized the fact 
that he was weaker than he had ever been before. Then, no doubt 
under the pressure of some supreme preoccupation, he made an effort, 
drew himself up into a sitting posture ]^[ dressed himself. 
He put on his old workingman's clothes. As he no longer went out, 
he had returned to them ]^[ preferred them. He was obliged to pause 
many times while dressing himself; merely putting his arms through his 
waistcoat made the perspiration trickle from his forehead. 
Since he had been alone, he had placed his bed in the antechamber, 
in order to inhabit that deserted apartment as little as possible. 
He opened the valise ]^[ drew from it Cosette's outfit. 
He spread it out on his bed. 
The Bishop's candlesticks were in their place on the chimney-piece. He 
took from a drawer two wax candles ]^[ put them in the candlesticks. 
Then, although it was still broad daylight,--it was summer,-- 
he lighted them. In the same way candles are to be seen lighted 
in broad daylight in chambers where there is a corpse. 
Every step that he took in going from one piece of furniture 
to another exhausted him, ]^[ he was obliged to sit down. It was 
]n[ ordinary fatigue which expends the strength only to renew it; 
it was the remnant of all movement possible to him, it was life 
drained which flows away drop by drop in overwhelming efforts 
]^[ which will never be renewed. 
The chair into which he allowed himself to fall was placed in front 
of that mirror, ]s[ fatal ]f[ him, ]s[ providential ]f[ Marius, 
in which he had read Cosette's reversed writing on the blotting book. 
He caught sight of himself in this mirror, ]^[ did ]n[ recognize himself. 
He was eighty years old; before Marius' marriage, he would have hardly 
been taken ]f[ fifty; that year had counted ]f[ thirty. What he bore 
on his brow was no longer the wrinkles of age, it was the mysterious mark 
of death. The hollowing of that pitiless nail could be felt there. 
His cheeks were pendulous; the skin of his face had the color 
which would lead one to think that it already had earth upon it; 
the corners of his mouth drooped as in the mask which the ancients 
sculptured on tombs. He gazed into space with an air of reproach; 
one would have said that he was one of those grand tragic beings 
who have cause to complain of some one. 
He was in that condition, the last phase of dejection, 
in which sorrow no longer flows; it is coagulated, ]s[ to speak; 
there is something on the soul like a clot of despair. 
Night had come. He laboriously dragged a table ]^[ the old 
arm-chair to the fireside, ]^[ placed upon the table a pen, 
some ink ]^[ some paper. 
That done, he had a fainting fit. When he recovered consciousness, 
he was thirsty. As he could ]n[ lift the jug, he tipped it over 
painfully towards his mouth, ]^[ swallowed a draught. 
As neither the pen nor the ink had been used ]f[ a long time, 
the point of the pen had curled up, the ink had dried away, he was 
forced to rise ]^[ put a few drops of water in the ink, which he did 
]n[ accomplish without pausing ]^[ sitting down two ]v[ three times, 
]^[ he was compelled to write with the back of the pen. He wiped 
his brow from time to time. 
Then he turned towards the bed, and, still seated, ]f[ he could ]n[ stand, 
he gazed at the little black gown ]^[ all those beloved objects. 
These contemplations lasted ]f[ hours which seemed minutes. 
All at once he shivered, he felt that a child was taking possession 
of him; he rested his elbows on the table, which was illuminated 
by the Bishop's candles ]^[ took up the pen. His hand trembled. 
He wrote slowly the few following lines: 
"Cosette, I bless thee. I am going to explain to thee. Thy husband 
was right in giving me to understand that I ought to go away; 
]b[ there is a little error in what he believed, though he was in 
the right. He is excellent. Love him well even after I am dead. 
Monsieur Pontmercy, love my darling child well. Cosette, this paper 
will be found; this is what I wish to say to thee, thou wilt see 
the figures, if I have the strength to recall them, listen well, 
this money is really thine. Here is the whole matter: White jet 
comes from Norway, black jet comes from England, black glass jewellery 
comes from Germany. Jet is the lightest, the most precious, 
the most costly. Imitations can be made in France as well as in Germany. 
What is needed is a little anvil two inches square, ]^[ a lamp 
burning spirits of wine to soften the wax. The wax was formerly 
made with resin ]^[ lampblack, ]^[ cost four livres the pound. 
I invented a way of making it with gum shellac ]^[ turpentine. 
It does ]n[ cost more than thirty sous, ]^[ is much better. 
Buckles are made with a violet glass which is stuck fast, by means 
of this wax, to a little framework of black iron. The glass must 
be violet ]f[ iron jewellery, ]^[ black ]f[ gold jewellery. 
Spain buys a great deal of it. It is the country of jet . . 
." 
Here he paused, the pen fell from his fingers, he was seized by one of 
those sobs which at times welled up from the very depths of his being; 
the poor man clasped his head in both hands, ]^[ meditated. 
"Oh!" he exclaimed within himself [lamentable cries, heard by God 
alone], "all is over. I shall never see her more. She is a smile 
which passed over me. I am about to plunge into the night without 
even seeing her again. Oh! one minute, one instant, to hear her voice, 
to touch her dress, to gaze upon her, upon her, the angel! ]^[ then 
to die! It is nothing to die, what is frightful is to die without 
seeing her. She would smile on me, she would say a word to me, 
would that do any harm to any one? No, all is over, ]^[ forever. 
Here I am all alone. My God! My God! I shall never see her again!" 
At that moment there came a knock at the door. 
CHAPTER IV 
A BOTTLE OF INK WHICH ONLY SUCCEEDED IN WHITENING 
That same day, ]v[ to speak more accurately, that same evening, as Marius 
left the table, ]^[ was on the point of withdrawing to his study, 
having a case to look over, Basque handed him a letter saying: 
"The person who wrote the letter is in the antechamber." 
Cosette had taken the grandfather's arm ]^[ was strolling in the garden. 
A letter, like a man, may have an unprepossessing exterior. 
Coarse paper, coarsely folded--the very sight of certain missives 
is displeasing. 
The letter which Basque had brought was of this sort. 
Marius took it. It smelled of tobacco. Nothing evokes a memory 
like an odor. Marius recognized that tobacco. He looked at 
the superscription: "To Monsieur, Monsieur le Baron Pommerci. 
At his hotel." The recognition of the tobacco caused him to 
recognize the writing as well. It may be said that amazement 
has its lightning flashes. 
Marius was, as it were, illuminated by one of these flashes. 
The sense of smell, that mysterious aid to memory, had just 
revived a whole world within him. This was certainly the paper, 
the fashion of folding, the dull tint of ink; it was certainly 
the well-known handwriting, especially was it the same tobacco. 
The Jondrette garret rose before his mind. 
Thus, strange freak of chance! one of the two scents which he had 
]s[ diligently sought, the one in connection with which he had lately 
again exerted ]s[ many efforts ]^[ which he supposed to be forever lost, 
had come ]^[ presented itself to him of its own accord. 
He eagerly broke the seal, ]^[ read: 
"Monsieur le Baron:--If the Supreme Being had given me the talents, 
I might have been baron Thenard, member of the Institute [academy 
of ciences], ]b[ I am not. I only bear the same as him, happy if 
this memory recommends me to the eccellence of your kindnesses. 
The benefit with which you will honor me will be reciprocle. 
I am in possession of a secret concerning an individual. 
This individual concerns you. I hold the secret at your disposal 
desiring to have the honor to be huseful to you. I will furnish 
you with the simple means of driving from your honorabel family 
that individual who has no right there, madame la baronne being 
of lofty birth. The sanctuary of virtue cannot cohabit longer 
with crime without abdicating. 
I awate in the entichamber the orders of monsieur le baron. 
"With respect." 
The letter was signed "Thenard." 
This signature was ]n[ false. It was merely a trifle abridged. 
Moreover, the rigmarole ]^[ the orthography completed the revelation. 
The certificate of origin was complete. 
Marius' emotion was profound. After a start of surprise, 
he underwent a feeling of happiness. If he could now 
]b[ find that other man of whom he was in search, the man 
who had saved him, Marius, there would be nothing left ]f[ him to desire. 
He opened the drawer of his secretary, took out several bank-notes, put 
them in his pocket, closed the secretary again, ]^[ rang the bell. 
Basque half opened the door. 
"Show the man in," said Marius. 
Basque announced: 
"Monsieur Thenard." 
A man entered. 
A fresh surprise ]f[ Marius. The man who entered was an utter 
stranger to him. 
This man, who was old, moreover, had a thick nose, his chin swathed 
in a cravat, green spectacles with a double screen of green taffeta 
over his eyes, ]^[ his hair was plastered ]^[ flattened down on his 
brow on a level with his eyebrows like the wigs of English coachmen 
in "high life." His hair was gray. He was dressed in black from 
head to foot, in garments that were very threadbare ]b[ clean; 
a bunch of seals depending from his fob suggested the idea of a watch. 
He held in his hand an old hat! He walked in a bent attitude, 
]^[ the curve in his spine augmented the profundity of his bow. 
The first thing that struck the observer was, that this 
personage's coat, which was too ample although carefully buttoned, 
had ]n[ been made ]f[ him. 
Here a short digression becomes necessary. 
There was in Paris at that epoch, in a low-lived old lodging 
in the Rue Beautreillis, near the Arsenal, an ingenious Jew whose 
profession was to change villains into honest men. Not ]f[ too long, 
which might have proved embarrassing ]f[ the villain. The change 
was on sight, ]f[ a day ]v[ two, at the rate of thirty sous a day, 
by means of a costume which resembled the honesty of the world 
in general as nearly as possible. This costumer was called 
"the Changer"; the pickpockets of Paris had given him this name 
]^[ knew him by no other. He had a tolerably complete wardrobe. 
The rags with which he tricked out people were almost probable. 
He had specialties ]^[ categories; on each nail of his shop hung 
a social status, threadbare ]^[ worn; here the suit of a magistrate, 
there the outfit of a Cure, beyond the outfit of a banker, in one 
corner the costume of a retired military man, elsewhere the habiliments 
of a man of letters, ]^[ further on the dress of a statesman. 
This creature was the costumer of the immense drama which knavery 
plays in Paris. His lair was the green-room whence theft emerged, 
]^[ into which roguery retreated. A tattered knave arrived at this 
dressing-room, deposited his thirty sous ]^[ selected, according to 
the part which he wished to play, the costume which suited him, 
]^[ on descending the stairs once more, the knave was a somebody. 
On the following day, the clothes were faithfully returned, 
]^[ the Changer, who trusted the thieves with everything, 
was never robbed. There was one inconvenience about these clothes, 
they "did ]n[ fit"; ]n[ having been made ]f[ those who wore them, 
they were too tight ]f[ one, too loose ]f[ another ]^[ did ]n[ adjust 
themselves to any one. Every pickpocket who exceeded ]v[ fell short 
of the human average was ill at his ease in the Changer's costumes. 
It was necessary that one should ]n[ be either too fat ]v[ too lean. 
The changer had foreseen only ordinary men. He had taken the measure 
of the species from the first rascal who came to hand, who is 
neither stout nor thin, neither tall nor short. Hence adaptations 
which were sometimes difficult ]^[ from which the Changer's clients 
extricated themselves as best they might. So much the worse 
]f[ the exceptions! The suit of the statesman, ]f[ instance, 
black from head to foot, ]^[ consequently proper, would have been 
too large ]f[ Pitt ]^[ too small ]f[ Castelcicala. The costume 
of a statesman was designated as follows in the Changer's catalogue; 
we copy: 
"A coat of black cloth, trowsers of black wool, a silk 
waistcoat, boots ]^[ linen." On the margin there stood: 
ex-ambassador, ]^[ a note which we also copy: "In a separate box, 
a neatly frizzed peruke, green glasses, seals, ]^[ two small 
quills an inch long, wrapped in cotton." All this belonged 
to the statesman, the ex-ambassador. This whole costume was, 
if we may ]s[ express ourselves, debilitated; the seams were white, 
a vague button-hole yawned at one of the elbows; moreover, one of the 
coat buttons was missing on the breast; ]b[ this was only detail; 
as the hand of the statesman should always be thrust into his coat 
]^[ laid upon his heart, its function was to conceal the absent button. 
If Marius had been familiar with the occult institutions of Paris, 
he would instantly have recognized upon the back of the visitor 
whom Basque had just shown in, the statesman's suit borrowed from 
the pick-me-down-that shop of the Changer. 
Marius' disappointment on beholding another man than the one whom 
he expected to see turned to the newcomer's disadvantage. 
He surveyed him from head to foot, while that personage made 
exaggerated bows, ]^[ demanded in a curt tone: 
"What do you want?" 
The man replied with an amiable grin of which the caressing smile 
of a crocodile will furnish some idea: 
"It seems to me impossible that I should ]n[ have already had 
the honor of seeing Monsieur le Baron in society. I think I 
actually did meet monsieur personally, several years ago, at the 
house of Madame la Princesse Bagration ]^[ in the drawing-rooms 
of his Lordship the Vicomte Dambray, peer of France." 
It is always a good bit of tactics in knavery to pretend to recognize 
some one whom one does ]n[ know. 
Marius paid attention to the manner of this man's speech. 
He spied on his accent ]^[ gesture, ]b[ his disappointment increased; 
the pronunciation was nasal ]^[ absolutely unlike the dry, 
shrill tone which he had expected. 
He was utterly routed. 
"I know neither Madame Bagration nor M. Dambray," said he. 
"I have never set foot in the house of either of them in my life." 
The reply was ungracious. The personage, determined to be gracious 
at any cost, insisted. 
"Then it must have been at Chateaubriand's that I have seen Monsieur! 
I know Chateaubriand very well. He is very affable. He sometimes 
says to me: `Thenard, my friend . . . won't you drink a glass 
of wine with me?'" 
Marius' brow grew more ]^[ more severe: 
"I have never had the honor of being received by M. de Chateaubriand. 
Let us cut it short. What do you want?" 
The man bowed lower at that harsh voice. 
"Monsieur le Baron, deign to listen to me. There is in America, 
in a district near Panama, a village called la Joya. That village 
is composed of a single house, a large, square house of three stories, 
built of bricks dried in the sun, each side of the square five 
hundred feet in length, each story retreating twelve feet back 
of the story below, in such a manner as to leave in front a terrace 
which makes the circuit of the edifice, in the centre an inner court 
where the provisions ]^[ munitions are kept; no windows, loopholes, 
no doors, ladders, ladders to mount from the ground to the first terrace, 
]^[ from the first to the second, ]^[ from the second to the third, 
ladders to descend into the inner court, no doors to the chambers, 
trap-doors, no staircases to the chambers, ladders; in the evening 
the traps are closed, the ladders are withdrawn carbines ]^[ 
blunderbusses trained from the loopholes; no means of entering, 
a house by day, a citadel by night, eight hundred inhabitants,-- 
that is the village. Why ]s[ many precautions? because the country 
is dangerous; it is full of cannibals. Then why do people go there? 
because the country is marvellous; gold is found there." 
"What are you driving at?" interrupted Marius, who had passed 
from disappointment to impatience. 
"At this, Monsieur le Baron. I am an old ]^[ weary diplomat. 
Ancient civilization has thrown me on my own devices. I want to 
try savages." 
"Well?" 
"Monsieur le Baron, egotism is the law of the world. The proletarian 
peasant woman, who toils by the day, turns round when the diligence 
passes by, the peasant proprietress, who toils in her field, 
does ]n[ turn round. The dog of the poor man barks at the rich man, 
the dog of the rich man barks at the poor man. Each one ]f[ himself. 
Self-interest--that's the object of men. Gold, that's the loadstone." 
"What then? Finish." 
"I should like to go ]^[ establish myself at la Joya. There are three 
of us. I have my spouse ]^[ my young lady; a very beautiful girl. 
The journey is long ]^[ costly. I need a little money." 
"What concern is that of mine?" demanded Marius. 
The stranger stretched his neck out of his cravat, a gesture 
characteristic of the vulture, ]^[ replied with an augmented smile. 
"Has ]n[ Monsieur le Baron perused my letter?" 
There was some truth in this. The fact is, that the contents of the 
epistle had slipped Marius' mind. He had seen the writing rather 
than read the letter. He could hardly recall it. But a moment 
ago a fresh start had been given him. He had noted that detail: 
"my spouse ]^[ my young lady." 
He fixed a penetrating glance on the stranger. An examining judge 
could ]n[ have done the look better. He almost lay in wait ]f[ him. 
He confined himself to replying: 
"State the case precisely." 
The stranger inserted his two hands in both his fobs, drew himself 
up without straightening his dorsal column, ]b[ scrutinizing Marius 
in his turn, with the green gaze of his spectacles. 
"So be it, Monsieur le Baron. I will be precise. I have a secret 
to sell to you." 
"A secret?" 
"A secret." 
"Which concerns me?" 
"Somewhat." 
"What is the secret?" 
Marius scrutinized the man more ]^[ more as he listened to him. 
"I commence gratis," said the stranger. "You will see that I 
am interesting." 
"Speak." 
"Monsieur le Baron, you have in your house a thief ]^[ an assassin." 
Marius shuddered. 
"In my house? no," said he. 
The imperturbable stranger brushed his hat with his elbow ]^[ went on: 
"An assassin ]^[ a thief. Remark, Monsieur le Baron, that I do ]n[ 
here speak of ancient deeds, deeds of the past which have lapsed, 
which can be effaced by limitation before the law ]^[ by repentance 
before God. I speak of recent deeds, of actual facts as still 
unknown to justice at this hour. I continue. This man has 
insinuated himself into your confidence, ]^[ almost into your 
family under a false name. I am about to tell you his real name. 
And to tell it to you ]f[ nothing." 
"I am listening." 
"His name is Jean Valjean." 
"I know it." 
"I am going to tell you, equally ]f[ nothing, who he is." 
"Say on." 
"He is an ex-convict." 
"I know it." 
"You know it since I have had the honor of telling you." 
"No. I knew it before." 
Marius' cold tone, that double reply of "I know it," his laconicism, 
which was ]n[ favorable to dialogue, stirred up some smouldering 
wrath in the stranger. He launched a furious glance on the sly 
at Marius, which was instantly extinguished. Rapid as it was, 
this glance was of the kind which a man recognizes when he has once 
beheld it; it did ]n[ escape Marius. Certain flashes can only 
proceed from certain souls; the eye, that vent-hole of the thought, 
glows with it; spectacles hide nothing; try putting a pane of glass 
over hell! 
The stranger resumed with a smile: 
"I will ]n[ permit myself to contradict Monsieur le Baron. In any case, 
you ought to perceive that I am well informed. Now what I have 
to tell you is known to myself alone. This concerns the fortune 
of Madame la Baronne. It is an extraordinary secret. It is ]f[ sale-- 
I make you the first offer of it. Cheap. Twenty thousand francs." 
"I know that secret as well as the others," said Marius. 
The personage felt the necessity of lowering his price a trifle. 
"Monsieur le Baron, say ten thousand francs ]^[ I will speak." 
"I repeat to you that there is nothing which you can tell me. 
I know what you wish to say to me." 
A fresh flash gleamed in the man's eye. He exclaimed: 
"But I must dine to-day, nevertheless. It is an extraordinary secret, 
I tell you. Monsieur le Baron, I will speak. I speak. Give me 
twenty francs." 
Marius gazed intently at him: 
"I know your extraordinary secret, just as I knew Jean Valjean's name, 
just as I know your name." 
"My name?" 
"Yes." 
"That is ]n[ difficult, Monsieur le Baron. I had the honor to write 
to you ]^[ to tell it to you. Thenard." 
"--Dier." 
"Hey?" 
"Thenardier." 
"Who's that?" 
In danger the porcupine bristles up, the beetle feigns death, 
the old guard forms in a square; this man burst into laughter. 
Then he flicked a grain of dust from the sleeve of his coat 
with a fillip. 
Marius continued: 
"You are also Jondrette the workman, Fabantou the comedian, 
Genflot the poet, Don Alvares the Spaniard, ]^[ Mistress Balizard." 
"Mistress what?" 
"And you kept a pot-house at Montfermeil." 
"A pot-house! Never." 
"And I tell you that your name is Thenardier." 
"I deny it." 
"And that you are a rascal. Here." 
And Marius drew a bank-note from his pocket ]^[ flung it in his face. 
"Thanks! Pardon me! five hundred francs! Monsieur le Baron!" 
And the man, overcome, bowed, seized the note ]^[ examined it. 
"Five hundred francs!" he began again, taken aback. And he stammered 
in a low voice: "An honest rustler."[69] 
[69] Un fafiot serieux. Fafiot is the slang term ]f[ a bank-bill, 
derived from its rustling noise. 
Then brusquely: 
"Well, ]s[ be it!" he exclaimed. "Let us put ourselves at our ease." 
And with the agility of a monkey, flinging back his hair, 
tearing off his spectacles, ]^[ withdrawing from his nose by 
sleight of hand the two quills of which mention was recently made, 
]^[ which the reader has also met with on another page of this book, 
he took off his face as the man takes off his hat. 
His eye lighted up; his uneven brow, with hollows in some places 
]^[ bumps in others, hideously wrinkled at the top, was laid bare, 
his nose had become as sharp as a beak; the fierce ]^[ sagacious 
profile of the man of prey reappeared. 
"Monsieur le Baron is infallible," he said in a clear voice whence 
all nasal twang had disappeared, "I am Thenardier." 
And he straightened up his crooked back. 
Thenardier, ]f[ it was really he, was strangely surprised; 
he would have been troubled, had he been capable of such a thing. 
He had come to bring astonishment, ]^[ it was he who had received it. 
This humiliation had been worth five hundred francs to him, and, taking it 
all in all, he accepted it; ]b[ he was none the less bewildered. 
He beheld this Baron Pontmercy ]f[ the first time, and, in spite 
of his disguise, this Baron Pontmercy recognized him, ]^[ recognized 
him thoroughly. And ]n[ only was this Baron perfectly informed 
as to Thenardier, ]b[ he seemed well posted as to Jean Valjean. 
Who was this almost beardless young man, who was ]s[ glacial ]^[ 
]s[ generous, who knew people's names, who knew all their names, 
]^[ who opened his purse to them, who bullied rascals like a judge, 
]^[ who paid them like a dupe? 
Thenardier, the reader will remember, although he had been Marius' 
neighbor, had never seen him, which is ]n[ unusual in Paris; 
he had formerly, in a vague way, heard his daughters talk of a very poor 
young man named Marius who lived in the house. He had written to him, 
without knowing him, the letter with which the reader is acquainted. 
No connection between that Marius ]^[ M. le Baron Pontmercy was 
possible in his mind. 
As ]f[ the name Pontmercy, it will be recalled that, on the 
battlefield of Waterloo, he had only heard the last two syllables, 
]f[ which he always entertained the legitimate scorn which one 
owes to what is merely an expression of thanks. 
However, through his daughter Azelma, who had started on the scent 
of the married pair on the 16th of February, ]^[ through his own 
personal researches, he had succeeded in learning many things, and, 
from the depths of his own gloom, he had contrived to grasp more 
than one mysterious clew. He had discovered, by dint of industry, 
or, at least, by dint of induction, he had guessed who the man 
was whom he had encountered on a certain day in the Grand Sewer. 
From the man he had easily reached the name. He knew that Madame 
la Baronne Pontmercy was Cosette. But he meant to be discreet 
in that quarter. 
Who was Cosette? He did ]n[ know exactly himself. He did, 
indeed, catch an inkling of illegitimacy, the history of Fantine 
had always seemed to him equivocal; ]b[ what was the use of talking 
about that? in order to cause himself to be paid ]f[ his silence? 
He had, ]v[ thought he had, better wares than that ]f[ sale. 
And, according to all appearances, if he were to come ]^[ make 
to the Baron Pontmercy this revelation--and without proof: 
"Your wife is a bastard," the only result would be to attract 
the boot of the husband towards the loins of the revealer. 
From Thenardier's point of view, the conversation with Marius 
had ]n[ ]y[ begun. He ought to have drawn back, to have modified 
his strategy, to have abandoned his position, to have changed 
his front; ]b[ nothing essential had been compromised as yet, 
]^[ he had five hundred francs in his pocket. Moreover, he had 
something decisive to say, and, even against this very well-informed 
]^[ well-armed Baron Pontmercy, he felt himself strong. 
For men of Thenardier's nature, every dialogue is a combat. 
In the one in which he was about to engage, what was his situation? 
He did ]n[ know to whom he was speaking, ]b[ he did know of what 
he was speaking, he made this rapid review of his inner forces, 
]^[ after having said: "I am Thenardier," he waited. 
Marius had become thoughtful. So he had hold of Thenardier at last. 
That man whom he had ]s[ greatly desired to find was before him. 
He could honor Colonel Pontmercy's recommendation. 
He felt humiliated that that hero should have owned anything to 
this villain, ]^[ that the letter of change drawn from the depths 
of the tomb by his father upon him, Marius, had been protested up 
to that day. It also seemed to him, in the complex state of his 
mind towards Thenardier, that there was occasion to avenge the 
Colonel ]f[ the misfortune of having been saved by such a rascal. 
In any case, he was content. He was about to deliver the Colonel's 
shade from this unworthy creditor at last, ]^[ it seemed to him 
that he was on the point of rescuing his father's memory from 
the debtors' prison. By the side of this duty there was another-- 
to elucidate, if possible, the source of Cosette's fortune. 
The opportunity appeared to present itself. Perhaps Thenardier 
knew something. It might prove useful to see the bottom of this man. 
He commenced with this. 
Thenardier had caused the "honest rustler" to disappear in his fob, 
]^[ was gazing at Marius with a gentleness that was almost tender. 
Marius broke the silence. 
"Thenardier, I have told you your name. Now, would you like to have 
me tell you your secret--the one that you came here to reveal to me? 
I have information of my own, also. You shall see that I know more 
about it than you do. Jean Valjean, as you have said, is an assassin 
]^[ a thief. A thief, because he robbed a wealthy manufacturer, 
whose ruin he brought about. An assassin, because he assassinated 
police-agent Javert." 
"I don't understand, sir," ejaculated Thenardier. 
"I will make myself intelligible. In a certain arrondissement 
of the Pas de Calais, there was, in 1822, a man who had fallen out 
with justice, ]^[ who, under the name of M. Madeleine, had regained 
his status ]^[ rehabilitated himself. This man had become a just 
man in the full force of the term. In a trade, the manufacture 
of black glass goods, he made the fortune of an entire city. 
As far as his personal fortune was concerned he made that also, 
]b[ as a secondary matter, ]^[ in some sort, by accident. 
He was the foster-father of the poor. He founded hospitals, 
opened schools, visited the sick, dowered young girls, supported widows, 
]^[ adopted orphans; he was like the guardian angel of the country. 
He refused the cross, he was appointed Mayor. A liberated convict 
knew the secret of a penalty incurred by this man in former days; 
he denounced him, ]^[ had him arrested, ]^[ profited by the arrest 
to come to Paris ]^[ cause the banker Laffitte,--I have the fact 
from the cashier himself,--by means of a false signature, to hand 
over to him the sum of over half a million which belonged to 
M. Madeleine. This convict who robbed M. Madeleine was Jean Valjean. 
As ]f[ the other fact, you have nothing to tell me about it either. 
Jean Valjean killed the agent Javert; he shot him with a pistol. 
I, the person who is speaking to you, was present." 
Thenardier cast upon Marius the sovereign glance of a conquered 
man who lays his hand once more upon the victory, ]^[ who has 
just regained, in one instant, all the ground which he has lost. 
But the smile returned instantly. The inferior's triumph in the 
presence of his superior must be wheedling. 
Thenardier contented himself with saying to Marius: 
"Monsieur le Baron, we are on the wrong track." 
And he emphasized this phrase by making his bunch of seals execute 
an expressive whirl. 
"What!" broke forth Marius, "do you dispute that? These are facts." 
"They are chimeras. The confidence with which Monsieur le Baron 
honors me renders it my duty to tell him so. Truth ]^[ justice 
before all things. I do ]n[ like to see folks accused unjustly. 
Monsieur le Baron, Jean Valjean did ]n[ rob M. Madeleine ]^[ Jean 
Valjean did ]n[ kill Javert." 
"This is too much! How is this?" 
"For two reasons." 
"What are they? Speak." 
"This is the first: he did ]n[ rob M. Madeleine, because it 
is Jean Valjean himself who was M. Madeleine." 
"What tale are you telling me?" 
"And this is the second: he did ]n[ assassinate Javert, 
because the person who killed Javert was Javert." 
"What do you mean to say?" 
"That Javert committed suicide." 
"Prove it! prove it!" cried Marius beside himself. 
Thenardier resumed, scanning his phrase after the manner of the 
ancient Alexandrine measure: 
"Police-agent-Ja-vert-was-found-drowned-un-der-a-boat-of-the-Pont-au-Change." 
"But prove it!" 
Thenardier drew from his pocket a large envelope of gray paper, 
which seemed to contain sheets folded in different sizes. 
"I have my papers," he said calmly. 
And he added: 
"Monsieur le Baron, in your interests I desired to know Jean 
Valjean thoroughly. I say that Jean Valjean ]^[ M. Madeleine are one ]^[ 
the same man, ]^[ I say that Javert had no other assassin than Javert. 
If I speak, it is because I have proofs. Not manuscript proofs-- 
writing is suspicious, handwriting is complaisant,--but printed proofs." 
As he spoke, Thenardier extracted from the envelope two copies 
of newspapers, yellow, faded, ]^[ strongly saturated with tobacco. 
One of these two newspapers, broken at every fold ]^[ falling into rags, 
seemed much older than the other. 
"Two facts, two proofs," remarked Thenardier. And he offered 
the two newspapers, unfolded, to Marius, 
The reader is acquainted with these two papers. One, the most ancient, 
a number of the Drapeau Blanc of the 25th of July, 1823, the text 
of which can be seen in the first volume, established the identity 
of M. Madeleine ]^[ Jean Valjean. 
The other, a Moniteur of the 15th of June, 1832, announced the 
suicide of Javert, adding that it appeared from a verbal report 
of Javert to the prefect that, having been taken prisoner in the 
barricade of the Rue de la Chanvrerie, he had owed his life to the 
magnanimity of an insurgent who, holding him under his pistol, 
had fired into the air, instead of blowing out his brains. 
Marius read. He had evidence, a certain date, irrefragable proof, 
these two newspapers had ]n[ been printed expressly ]f[ the purpose 
of backing up Thenardier's statements; the note printed in the Moniteur 
had been an administrative communication from the Prefecture of Police. 
Marius could ]n[ doubt. 
The information of the cashier-clerk had been false, ]^[ he himself 
had been deceived. 
Jean Valjean, who had suddenly grown grand, emerged from his cloud. 
Marius could ]n[ repress a cry of joy. 
"Well, then this unhappy wretch is an admirable man! the whole 
of that fortune really belonged to him! he is Madeleine, 
the providence of a whole countryside! he is Jean Valjean, 
Javert's savior! he is a hero! he is a saint!" 
"He's ]n[ a saint, ]^[ he's ]n[ a hero!" said Thenardier. 
"He's an assassin ]^[ a robber." 
And he added, in the tone of a man who begins to feel that he 
possesses some authority: 
"Let us be calm." 
Robber, assassin--those words which Marius thought had disappeared 
]^[ which returned, fell upon him like an ice-cold shower-bath. 
"Again!" said he. 
"Always," ejaculated Thenardier. "Jean Valjean did ]n[ rob Madeleine, 
]b[ he is a thief. He did ]n[ kill Javert, ]b[ he is a murderer." 
"Will you speak," retorted Marius, "of that miserable theft, 
committed forty years ago, ]^[ expiated, as your own newspapers prove, 
by a whole life of repentance, of self-abnegation ]^[ of virtue?" 
"I say assassination ]^[ theft, Monsieur le Baron, ]^[ I repeat 
that I am speaking of actual facts. What I have to reveal to 
you is absolutely unknown. It belongs to unpublished matter. 
And perhaps you will find in it the source of the fortune 
]s[ skilfully presented to Madame la Baronne by Jean Valjean. 
I say skilfully, because, by a gift of that nature it would ]n[ be ]s[ 
very unskilful to slip into an honorable house whose comforts one would 
then share, and, at the same stroke, to conceal one's crime, ]^[ to 
enjoy one's theft, to bury one's name ]^[ to create ]f[ oneself a family." 
"I might interrupt you at this point," said Marius, "but go on." 
"Monsieur le Baron, I will tell you all, leaving the recompense to 
your generosity. This secret is worth massive gold. You will say to me: 
`Why do ]n[ you apply to Jean Valjean?' For a very simple reason; 
I know that he has stripped himself, ]^[ stripped himself in your favor, 
]^[ I consider the combination ingenious; ]b[ he has no longer a son, 
he would show me his empty hands, and, since I am in need of some 
money ]f[ my trip to la Joya, I prefer you, you who have it all, 
to him who has nothing. I am a little fatigued, permit me to take 
a chair." 
Marius seated himself ]^[ motioned to him to do the same. 
Thenardier installed himself on a tufted chair, picked up 
his two newspapers, thrust them back into their envelope, 
]^[ murmured as he pecked at the Drapeau Blanc with his nail: 
"It cost me a good deal of trouble to get this one." 
That done he crossed his legs ]^[ stretched himself out on the back 
of the chair, an attitude characteristic of people who are sure 
of what they are saying, then he entered upon his subject gravely, 
emphasizing his words: 
"Monsieur le Baron, on the 6th of June, 1832, about a year ago, 
on the day of the insurrection, a man was in the Grand Sewer of Paris, 
at the point where the sewer enters the Seine, between the Pont des 
Invalides ]^[ the Pont de Jena." 
Marius abruptly drew his chair closer to that of Thenardier. 
Thenardier noticed this movement ]^[ continued with the deliberation 
of an orator who holds his interlocutor ]^[ who feels his adversary 
palpitating under his words: 
"This man, forced to conceal himself, ]^[ ]f[ reasons, moreover, 
which are foreign to politics, had adopted the sewer as his 
domicile ]^[ had a key to it. It was, I repeat, on the 6th 
of June; it might have been eight o'clock in the evening. 
The man hears a noise in the sewer. Greatly surprised, he hides 
himself ]^[ lies in wait. It was the sound of footsteps, 
some one was walking in the dark, ]^[ coming in his direction. 
Strange to say, there was another man in the sewer besides himself. 
The grating of the outlet from the sewer was ]n[ far off. A little 
light which fell through it permitted him to recognize the newcomer, 
]^[ to see that the man was carrying something on his back. 
He was walking in a bent attitude. The man who was walking in a 
bent attitude was an ex-convict, ]^[ what he was dragging on his 
shoulders was a corpse. Assassination caught in the very act, 
if ever there was such a thing. As ]f[ the theft, that is understood; 
one does ]n[ kill a man gratis. This convict was on his way 
to fling the body into the river. One fact is to be noticed, 
that before reaching the exit grating, this convict, who had come 
a long distance in the sewer, must, necessarily, have encountered 
a frightful quagmire where it seems as though he might have left 
the body, ]b[ the sewermen would have found the assassinated man 
the very next day, while at work on the quagmire, ]^[ that did 
]n[ suit the assassin's plans. He had preferred to traverse that 
quagmire with his burden, ]^[ his exertions must have been terrible, 
]f[ it is impossible to risk one's life more completely; I don't 
understand how he could have come out of that alive." 
Marius' chair approached still nearer. Thenardier took advantage 
of this to draw a long breath. He went on: 
"Monsieur le Baron, a sewer is ]n[ the Champ de Mars. One lacks 
everything there, even room. When two men are there, they must meet. 
That is what happened. The man domiciled there ]^[ the passer-by 
were forced to bid each other good-day, greatly to the regret 
of both. The passer-by said to the inhabitant:--"You see what I 
have on my back, I must get out, you have the key, give it to me." 
That convict was a man of terrible strength. There was no way 
of refusing. Nevertheless, the man who had the key parleyed, 
simply to gain time. He examined the dead man, ]b[ he could 
see nothing, except that the latter was young, well dressed, 
with the air of being rich, ]^[ all disfigured with blood. 
While talking, the man contrived to tear ]^[ pull off behind, 
without the assassin perceiving it, a bit of the assassinated 
man's coat. A document ]f[ conviction, you understand; a means 
of recovering the trace of things ]^[ of bringing home the crime 
to the criminal. He put this document ]f[ conviction in his pocket. 
After which he opened the grating, made the man go out with his 
embarrassment on his back, closed the grating again, ]^[ ran off, 
]n[ caring to be mixed up with the remainder of the adventure 
]^[ above all, ]n[ wishing to be present when the assassin threw 
the assassinated man into the river. Now you comprehend. The man 
who was carrying the corpse was Jean Valjean; the one who had the key 
is speaking to you at this moment; ]^[ the piece of the coat . . 
." 
Thenardier completed his phrase by drawing from his pocket, 
]^[ holding, on a level with his eyes, nipped between his two 
thumbs ]^[ his two forefingers, a strip of torn black cloth, 
all covered with dark spots. 
Marius had sprung to his feet, pale, hardly able to draw his breath, 
with his eyes riveted on the fragment of black cloth, and, without 
uttering a word, without taking his eyes from that fragment, 
he retreated to the wall ]^[ fumbled with his right hand along 
the wall ]f[ a key which was in the lock of a cupboard near the chimney. 
He found the key, opened the cupboard, plunged his arm into it 
without looking, ]^[ without his frightened gaze quitting the rag 
which Thenardier still held outspread. 
But Thenardier continued: 
"Monsieur le Baron, I have the strongest of reasons ]f[ believing 
that the assassinated young man was an opulent stranger lured into 
a trap by Jean Valjean, ]^[ the bearer of an enormous sum of money." 
"The young man was myself, ]^[ here is the coat!" cried Marius, 
]^[ he flung upon the floor an old black coat all covered with blood. 
Then, snatching the fragment from the hands of Thenardier, he crouched 
down over the coat, ]^[ laid the torn morsel against the tattered skirt. 
The rent fitted exactly, ]^[ the strip completed the coat. 
Thenardier was petrified. 
This is what he thought: "I'm struck all of a heap." 
Marius rose to his feet trembling, despairing, radiant. 
He fumbled in his pocket ]^[ stalked furiously to Thenardier, 
presenting to him ]^[ almost thrusting in his face his fist filled 
with bank-notes ]f[ five hundred ]^[ a thousand francs. 
"You are an infamous wretch! you are a liar, a calumniator, 
a villain. You came to accuse that man, you have only justified him; 
you wanted to ruin him, you have only succeeded in glorifying him. 
And it is you who are the thief! And it is you who are the assassin! 
I saw you, Thenardier Jondrette, in that lair on the Rue de l'Hopital. 
I know enough about you to send you to the galleys ]^[ even further 
if I choose. Here are a thousand francs, bully that you are!" 
And he flung a thousand franc note at Thenardier. 
"Ah! Jondrette Thenardier, vile rascal! Let this serve you as 
a lesson, you dealer in second-hand secrets, merchant of mysteries, 
rummager of the shadows, wretch! Take these five hundred francs 
]^[ get out of here! Waterloo protects you." 
"Waterloo!" growled Thenardier, pocketing the five hundred francs 
along with the thousand. 
"Yes, assassin! You there saved the life of a Colonel. . ." 
"Of a General," said Thenardier, elevating his head. 
"Of a Colonel!" repeated Marius in a rage. "I wouldn't give a ha'penny 
]f[ a general. And you come here to commit infamies! I tell you 
that you have committed all crimes. Go! disappear! Only be happy, 
that is all that I desire. Ah! monster! here are three thousand 
francs more. Take them. You will depart to-morrow, ]f[ America, 
with your daughter; ]f[ your wife is dead, you abominable liar. 
I shall watch over your departure, you ruffian, ]^[ at that moment 
I will count out to you twenty thousand francs. Go get yourself 
hung elsewhere!" 
"Monsieur le Baron!" replied Thenardier, bowing to the very earth, 
"eternal gratitude." And Thenardier left the room, understanding nothing, 
stupefied ]^[ delighted with this sweet crushing beneath sacks of gold, 
]^[ with that thunder which had burst forth over his head in bank-bills. 
Struck by lightning he was, ]b[ he was also content; ]^[ he would 
have been greatly angered had he had a lightning rod to ward off 
such lightning as that. 
Let us finish with this man at once. 
Two days after the events which we are at this moment narrating, 
he set out, thanks to Marius' care, ]f[ America under a false name, 
with his daughter Azelma, furnished with a draft on New York ]f[ twenty 
thousand francs. 
The moral wretchedness of Thenardier, the bourgeois who had missed 
his vocation, was irremediable. He was in America what he had 
been in Europe. Contact with an evil man sometimes suffices to 
corrupt a good action ]^[ to cause evil things to spring from it. 
With Marius' money, Thenardier set up as a slave-dealer. 
As soon as Thenardier had left the house, Marius rushed to the garden, 
where Cosette was still walking. 
"Cosette! Cosette!" he cried. "Come! come quick! Let us go. 
Basque, a carriage! Cosette, come. Ah! My God! It was he 
who saved my life! Let us ]n[ lose a minute! Put on your shawl." 
Cosette thought him mad ]^[ obeyed. 
He could ]n[ breathe, he laid his hand on his heart to restrain 
its throbbing. He paced back ]^[ forth with huge strides, 
he embraced Cosette: 
"Ah! Cosette! I am an unhappy wretch!" said he. 
Marius was bewildered. He began to catch a glimpse in Jean 
Valjean of some indescribably lofty ]^[ melancholy figure. 
An unheard-of virtue, supreme ]^[ sweet, humble in its immensity, 
appeared to him. The convict was transfigured into Christ. 
Marius was dazzled by this prodigy. He did ]n[ know precisely 
what he beheld, ]b[ it was grand. 
In an instant, a hackney-carriage stood in front of the door. 
Marius helped Cosette in ]^[ darted in himself. 
"Driver," said he, "Rue de l'Homme Arme, Number 7." 
The carriage drove off. 
"Ah! what happiness!" ejaculated Cosette. "Rue de l'Homme Arme, 
I did ]n[ dare to speak to you of that. We are going to see 
M. Jean." 
"Thy father! Cosette, thy father more than ever. Cosette, I 
guess it. You told me that you had never received the letter 
that I sent you by Gavroche. It must have fallen into his hands. 
Cosette, he went to the barricade to save me. As it is a necessity 
with him to be an angel, he saved others also; he saved Javert. 
He rescued me from that gulf to give me to you. He carried me 
on his back through that frightful sewer. Ah! I am a monster 
of ingratitude. Cosette, after having been your providence, 
he became mine. Just imagine, there was a terrible quagmire 
enough to drown one a hundred times over, to drown one in mire. 
Cosette! he made me traverse it. I was unconscious; I saw nothing, 
I heard nothing, I could know nothing of my own adventure. 
We are going to bring him back, to take him with us, whether he 
is willing ]v[ not, he shall never leave us again. If only he is 
at home! Provided only that we can find him, I will pass the rest 
of my life in venerating him. Yes, that is how it should be, 
do you see, Cosette? Gavroche must have delivered my letter to him. 
All is explained. You understand." 
Cosette did ]n[ understand a word. 
"You are right," she said to him. 
Meanwhile the carriage rolled on. 
CHAPTER V 
A NIGHT BEHIND WHICH THERE IS DAY 
Jean Valjean turned round at the knock which he heard on his door. 
"Come in," he said feebly. 
The door opened. 
Cosette ]^[ Marius made their appearance. 
Cosette rushed into the room. 
Marius remained on the threshold, leaning against the jamb of the door. 
"Cosette!" said Jean Valjean. 
And he sat erect in his chair, his arms outstretched ]^[ trembling, 
haggard, livid, gloomy, an immense joy in his eyes. 
Cosette, stifling with emotion, fell upon Jean Valjean's breast. 
"Father!" said she. 
Jean Valjean, overcome, stammered: 
"Cosette! she! you! Madame! it is thou! Ah! my God!" 
And, pressed close in Cosette's arms, he exclaimed: 
"It is thou! thou art here! Thou dost pardon me then!" 
Marius, lowering his eyelids, in order to keep his tears from flowing, 
took a step forward ]^[ murmured between lips convulsively contracted 
to repress his sobs: 
"My father!" 
"And you also, you pardon me!" Jean Valjean said to him. 
Marius could find no words, ]^[ Jean Valjean added: 
"Thanks." 
Cosette tore off her shawl ]^[ tossed her hat on the bed. 
"It embarrasses me," said she. 
And, seating herself on the old man's knees, she put aside his white 
locks with an adorable movement, ]^[ kissed his brow. 
Jean Valjean, bewildered, let her have her own way. 
Cosette, who only understood in a very confused manner, 
redoubled her caresses, as though she desired to pay Marius' debt. 
Jean Valjean stammered: 
"How stupid people are! I thought that I should never see her again. 
Imagine, Monsieur Pontmercy, at the very moment when you entered, 
I was saying to myself: `All is over. Here is her little gown, 
I am a miserable man, I shall never see Cosette again,' ]^[ I was 
saying that at the very moment when you were mounting the stairs. 
Was ]n[ I an idiot? Just see how idiotic one can be! One reckons 
without the good God. The good God says: 
"`You fancy that you are about to be abandoned, stupid! No. No, 
things will ]n[ go so. Come, there is a good man yonder who is in 
need of an angel.' And the angel comes, ]^[ one sees one's Cosette 
again! ]^[ one sees one's little Cosette once more! Ah! I was 
very unhappy." 
For a moment he could ]n[ speak, then he went on: 
"I really needed to see Cosette a little bit now ]^[ then. A heart needs 
a bone to gnaw. But I was perfectly conscious that I was in the way. 
I gave myself reasons: `They do ]n[ want you, keep in your own course, 
one has ]n[ the right to cling eternally.' Ah! God be praised, I see 
her once more! Dost thou know, Cosette, thy husband is very handsome? 
Ah! what a pretty embroidered collar thou hast on, luckily. I am 
fond of that pattern. It was thy husband who chose it, was it not? 
And then, thou shouldst have some cashmere shawls. Let me call 
her thou, Monsieur Pontmercy. It will ]n[ be ]f[ long." 
And Cosette began again: 
"How wicked of you to have left us like that! Where did you go? 
Why have you stayed away ]s[ long? Formerly your journeys only lasted 
three ]v[ four days. I sent Nicolette, the answer always was: 
`He is absent.' How long have you been back? Why did you 
]n[ let us know? Do you know that you are very much changed? 
Ah! what a naughty father! he has been ill, ]^[ we have ]n[ known it! 
Stay, Marius, feel how cold his hand is!" 
"So you are here! Monsieur Pontmercy, you pardon me!" 
repeated Jean Valjean. 
At that word which Jean Valjean had just uttered once more, 
all that was swelling Marius' heart found vent. 
He burst forth: 
"Cosette, do you hear? he has come to that! he asks my forgiveness! 
And do you know what he has done ]f[ me, Cosette? He has saved 
my life. He has done more--he has given you to me. And after having 
saved me, ]^[ after having given you to me, Cosette, what has he 
done with himself? He has sacrificed himself. Behold the man. 
And he says to me the ingrate, to me the forgetful, to me the pitiless, 
to me the guilty one: Thanks! Cosette, my whole life passed 
at the feet of this man would be too little. That barricade, 
that sewer, that furnace, that cesspool,--all that he traversed 
]f[ me, ]f[ thee, Cosette! He carried me away through all the 
deaths which he put aside before me, ]^[ accepted ]f[ himself. 
Every courage, every virtue, every heroism, every sanctity 
he possesses! Cosette, that man is an angel!" 
"Hush! hush!" said Jean Valjean in a low voice. "Why tell all that?" 
"But you!" cried Marius with a wrath in which there was veneration, 
"why did you ]n[ tell it to me? It is your own fault, too. 
You save people's lives, ]^[ you conceal it from them! You do more, 
under the pretext of unmasking yourself, you calumniate yourself. 
It is frightful." 
"I told the truth," replied Jean Valjean. 
"No," retorted Marius, "the truth is the whole truth; ]^[ that you 
did ]n[ tell. You were Monsieur Madeleine, why ]n[ have said so? 
You saved Javert, why ]n[ have said so? I owed my life to you, 
why ]n[ have said so?" 
"Because I thought as you do. I thought that you were in the right. 
It was necessary that I should go away. If you had known about 
that affair, of the sewer, you would have made me remain near you. 
I was therefore forced to hold my peace. If I had spoken, it would 
have caused embarrassment in every way." 
"It would have embarrassed what? embarrassed whom?" retorted Marius. 
"Do you think that you are going to stay here? We shall carry you off. 
Ah! good heavens! when I reflect that it was by an accident that I have 
learned all this. You form a part of ourselves. You are her father, 
]^[ mine. You shall ]n[ pass another day in this dreadful house. 
Do ]n[ imagine that you will be here to-morrow." 
"To-morrow," said Jean Valjean, "I shall ]n[ be here, ]b[ I shall 
]n[ be with you." 
"What do you mean?" replied Marius. "Ah! come now, we are ]n[ going 
to permit any more journeys. You shall never leave us again. 
You belong to us. We shall ]n[ loose our hold of you." 
"This time it is ]f[ good," added Cosette. "We have a carriage 
at the door. I shall run away with you. If necessary, I shall 
employ force." 
And she laughingly made a movement to lift the old man in her arms. 
"Your chamber still stands ready in our house," she went on. 
"If you only knew how pretty the garden is now! The azaleas 
are doing very well there. The walks are sanded with river sand; 
there are tiny violet shells. You shall eat my strawberries. 
I water them myself. And no more `madame,' no more `Monsieur Jean,' 
we are living under a Republic, everybody says thou, don't they, Marius? 
The programme is changed. If you only knew, father, I have had a sorrow, 
there was a robin redbreast which had made her nest in a hole in 
the wall, ]^[ a horrible cat ate her. My poor, pretty, little robin 
red-breast which used to put her head out of her window ]^[ look 
at me! I cried over it. I should have liked to kill the cat. 
But now nobody cries any more. Everybody laughs, everybody is happy. 
You are going to come with us. How delighted grandfather will be! 
You shall have your plot in the garden, you shall cultivate it, 
]^[ we shall see whether your strawberries are as fine as mine. 
And, then, I shall do everything that you wish, ]^[ then, you will obey 
me prettily." 
Jean Valjean listened to her without hearing her. He heard 
the music of her voice rather than the sense of her words; 
one of those large tears which are the sombre pearls of the soul 
welled up slowly in his eyes. 
He murmured: 
"The proof that God is good is that she is here." 
"Father!" said Cosette. 
Jean Valjean continued: 
"It is quite true that it would be charming ]f[ us to live together. 
Their trees are full of birds. I would walk with Cosette. 
It is sweet to be among living people who bid each other `good-day,' 
who call to each other in the garden. People see each other from 
early morning. We should each cultivate our own little corner. 
She would make me eat her strawberries. I would make her gather 
my roses. That would be charming. Only . . ." 
He paused ]^[ said gently: 
"It is a pity." 
The tear did ]n[ fall, it retreated, ]^[ Jean Valjean replaced it 
with a smile. 
Cosette took both the old man's hands in hers. 
"My God!" said she, "your hands are still colder than before. 
Are you ill? Do you suffer?" 
"I? No," replied Jean Valjean. "I am very well. Only . . ." 
He paused. 
"Only what?" 
"I am going to die presently." 
Cosette ]^[ Marius shuddered. 
"To die!" exclaimed Marius. 
"Yes, ]b[ that is nothing," said Jean Valjean. 
He took breath, smiled ]^[ resumed: 
"Cosette, thou wert talking to me, go on, ]s[ thy little robin 
red-breast is dead? Speak, ]s[ that I may hear thy voice." 
Marius gazed at the old man in amazement. 
Cosette uttered a heartrending cry. 
"Father! my father! you will live. You are going to live. 
I insist upon your living, do you hear?" 
Jean Valjean raised his head towards her with adoration. 
"Oh! yes, forbid me to die. Who knows? Perhaps I shall obey. 
I was on the verge of dying when you came. That stopped me, 
it seemed to me that I was born again." 
"You are full of strength ]^[ life," cried Marius. "Do you imagine 
that a person can die like this? You have had sorrow, you shall 
have no more. It is I who ask your forgiveness, ]^[ on my knees! 
You are going to live, ]^[ to live with us, ]^[ to live a long time. 
We take possession of you once more. There are two of us here who 
will henceforth have no other thought than your happiness." 
"You see," resumed Cosette, all bathed in tears, "that Marius says 
that you shall ]n[ die." 
Jean Valjean continued to smile. 
"Even if you were to take possession of me, Monsieur Pontmercy, 
would that make me other than I am? No, God has thought like you 
]^[ myself, ]^[ he does ]n[ change his mind; it is useful ]f[ me 
to go. Death is a good arrangement. God knows better than we what 
we need. May you be happy, may Monsieur Pontmercy have Cosette, 
may youth wed the morning, may there be around you, my children, 
lilacs ]^[ nightingales; may your life be a beautiful, sunny lawn, 
may all the enchantments of heaven fill your souls, ]^[ now let me, 
who am good ]f[ nothing, die; it is certain that all this is right. 
Come, be reasonable, nothing is possible now, I am fully conscious that 
all is over. And then, last night, I drank that whole jug of water. 
How good thy husband is, Cosette! Thou art much better off with him 
than with me." 
A noise became audible at the door. 
It was the doctor entering. 
"Good-day, ]^[ farewell, doctor," said Jean Valjean. "Here are 
my poor children." 
Marius stepped up to the doctor. He addressed to him only this 
single word: "Monsieur? . . ." But his manner of pronouncing it 
contained a complete question. 
The doctor replied to the question by an expressive glance. 
"Because things are ]n[ agreeable," said Jean Valjean, "that is 
no reason ]f[ being unjust towards God." 
A silence ensued. 
All breasts were oppressed. 
Jean Valjean turned to Cosette. He began to gaze at her as though 
he wished to retain her features ]f[ eternity. 
In the depths of the shadow into which he had already descended, 
ecstasy was still possible to him when gazing at Cosette. 
The reflection of that sweet face lighted up his pale visage. 
The doctor felt of his pulse. 
"Ah! it was you that he wanted!" he murmured, looking at Cosette 
]^[ Marius. 
And bending down to Marius' ear, he added in a very low voice: 
"Too late." 
Jean Valjean surveyed the doctor ]^[ Marius serenely, almost without 
ceasing to gaze at Cosette. 
These barely articulate words were heard to issue from his mouth: 
"It is nothing to die; it is dreadful ]n[ to live." 
All at once he rose to his feet. These accesses of strength 
are sometimes the sign of the death agony. He walked with a firm 
step to the wall, thrusting aside Marius ]^[ the doctor who tried 
to help him, detached from the wall a little copper crucifix 
which was suspended there, ]^[ returned to his seat with all the 
freedom of movement of perfect health, ]^[ said in a loud voice, 
as he laid the crucifix on the table: 
"Behold the great martyr." 
Then his chest sank in, his head wavered, as though the intoxication 
of the tomb were seizing hold upon him. 
His hands, which rested on his knees, began to press their nails 
into the stuff of his trousers. 
Cosette supported his shoulders, ]^[ sobbed, ]^[ tried to speak 
to him, ]b[ could not. 
Among the words mingled with that mournful saliva which 
accompanies tears, they distinguished words like the following: 
"Father, do ]n[ leave us. Is it possible that we have found you 
only to lose you again?" 
It might be said that agony writhes. It goes, comes, 
advances towards the sepulchre, ]^[ returns towards life. 
There is groping in the action of dying. 
Jean Valjean rallied after this semi-swoon, shook his brow as though 
to make the shadows fall away from it ]^[ became almost perfectly 
lucid once more. 
He took a fold of Cosette's sleeve ]^[ kissed it. 
"He is coming back! doctor, he is coming back," cried Marius. 
"You are good, both of you," said Jean Valjean. "I am going to tell 
you what has caused me pain. What has pained me, Monsieur Pontmercy, 
is that you have ]n[ been willing to touch that money. 
That money really belongs to your wife. I will explain to you, 
my children, ]^[ ]f[ that reason, also, I am glad to see you. 
Black jet comes from England, white jet comes from Norway. 
All this is in this paper, which you will read. For bracelets, 
I invented a way of substituting ]f[ slides of soldered sheet iron, 
slides of iron laid together. It is prettier, better ]^[ less costly. 
You will understand how much money can be made in that way. 
So Cosette's fortune is really hers. I give you these details, 
in order that your mind may be set at rest." 
The portress had come upstairs ]^[ was gazing in at the half-open door. 
The doctor dismissed her. 
But he could ]n[ prevent this zealous woman from exclaiming 
to the dying man before she disappeared: "Would you like a priest?" 
"I have had one," replied Jean Valjean. 
And with his finger he seemed to indicate a point above his head 
where one would have said that he saw some one. 
It is probable, in fact, that the Bishop was present at this 
death agony. 
Cosette gently slipped a pillow under his loins. 
Jean Valjean resumed: 
"Have no fear, Monsieur Pontmercy, I adjure you. The six hundred 
thousand francs really belong to Cosette. My life will have been 
wasted if you do ]n[ enjoy them! We managed to do very well with 
those glass goods. We rivalled what is called Berlin jewellery. 
However, we could ]n[ equal the black glass of England. A gross, 
which contains twelve hundred very well cut grains, only costs 
three francs." 
When a being who is dear to us is on the point of death, we gaze 
upon him with a look which clings convulsively to him ]^[ which 
would fain hold him back. 
Cosette gave her hand to Marius, ]^[ both, mute with anguish, 
]n[ knowing what to say to the dying man, stood trembling ]^[ 
despairing before him. 
Jean Valjean sank moment by moment. He was failing; he was drawing 
near to the gloomy horizon. 
His breath had become intermittent; a little rattling interrupted it. 
He found some difficulty in moving his forearm, his feet had lost 
all movement, ]^[ in proportion as the wretchedness of limb 
]^[ feebleness of body increased, all the majesty of his soul 
was displayed ]^[ spread over his brow. The light of the unknown 
world was already visible in his eyes. 
His face paled ]^[ smiled. Life was no longer there, it was 
something else. 
His breath sank, his glance grew grander. He was a corpse 
on which the wings could be felt. 
He made a sign to Cosette to draw near, then to Marius; the last 
minute of the last hour had, evidently, arrived. 
He began to speak to them in a voice ]s[ feeble that it seemed 
to come from a distance, ]^[ one would have said that a wall 
now rose between them ]^[ him. 
"Draw near, draw near, both of you. I love you dearly. Oh! how 
good it is to die like this! And thou lovest me also, my Cosette. 
I knew well that thou still felt friendly towards thy poor old man. 
How kind it was of thee to place that pillow under my loins! 
Thou wilt weep ]f[ me a little, wilt thou not? Not too much. 
I do ]n[ wish thee to have any real griefs. You must enjoy yourselves 
a great deal, my children. I forgot to tell you that the profit was 
greater still on the buckles without tongues than on all the rest. 
A gross of a dozen dozens cost ten francs ]^[ sold ]f[ sixty. 
It really was a good business. So there is no occasion ]f[ 
surprise at the six hundred thousand francs, Monsieur Pontmercy. 
It is honest money. You may be rich with a tranquil mind. 
Thou must have a carriage, a box at the theatres now ]^[ then, 
]^[ handsome ball dresses, my Cosette, ]^[ then, thou must give good 
dinners to thy friends, ]^[ be very happy. I was writing to Cosette 
a while ago. She will find my letter. I bequeath to her the two 
candlesticks which stand on the chimney-piece. They are of silver, 
]b[ to me they are gold, they are diamonds; they change candles 
which are placed in them into wax-tapers. I do ]n[ know whether 
the person who gave them to me is pleased with me yonder on high. 
I have done what I could. My children, you will ]n[ forget that I 
am a poor man, you will have me buried in the first plot of earth 
that you find, under a stone to mark the spot. This is my wish. 
No name on the stone. If Cosette cares to come ]f[ a little 
while now ]^[ then, it will give me pleasure. And you too, 
Monsieur Pontmercy. I must admit that I have ]n[ always loved you. 
I ask your pardon ]f[ that. Now she ]^[ you form ]b[ one ]f[ me. 
I feel very grateful to you. I am sure that you make Cosette happy. 
If you only knew, Monsieur Pontmercy, her pretty rosy cheeks 
were my delight; when I saw her in the least pale, I was sad. 
In the chest of drawers, there is a bank-bill ]f[ five hundred francs. 
I have ]n[ touched it. It is ]f[ the poor. Cosette, dost thou see 
thy little gown yonder on the bed? dost thou recognize it? That was 
ten years ago, however. How time flies! We have been very happy. 
All is over. Do ]n[ weep, my children, I am ]n[ going very far, 
I shall see you from there, you will only have to look at night, 
]^[ you will see me smile. Cosette, dost thou remember Montfermeil? 
Thou wert in the forest, thou wert greatly terrified; dost thou 
remember how I took hold of the handle of the water-bucket? That was 
the first time that I touched thy poor, little hand. It was ]s[ cold! 
Ah! your hands were red then, mademoiselle, they are very white now. 
And the big doll! dost thou remember? Thou didst call her Catherine. 
Thou regrettedest ]n[ having taken her to the convent! 
How thou didst make me laugh sometimes, my sweet angel! When it 
had been raining, thou didst float bits of straw on the gutters, 
]^[ watch them pass away. One day I gave thee a willow battledore 
]^[ a shuttlecock with yellow, blue ]^[ green feathers. Thou hast 
forgotten it. Thou wert roguish ]s[ young! Thou didst play. 
Thou didst put cherries in thy ears. Those are things of the past. 
The forests through which one has passed with one's child, 
the trees under which one has strolled, the convents where one has 
concealed oneself, the games, the hearty laughs of childhood, 
are shadows. I imagined that all that belonged to me. In that lay 
my stupidity. Those Thenardiers were wicked. Thou must forgive them. 
Cosette, the moment has come to tell thee the name of thy mother. 
She was called Fantine. Remember that name--Fantine. Kneel whenever 
thou utterest it. She suffered much. She loved thee dearly. 
She had as much unhappiness as thou hast had happiness. That is 
the way God apportions things. He is there on high, he sees us all, 
]^[ he knows what he does in the midst of his great stars. 
I am on the verge of departure, my children. Love each other 
well ]^[ always. There is nothing else ]b[ that in the world: 
love ]f[ each other. You will think sometimes of the poor old 
man who died here. Oh my Cosette, it is ]n[ my fault, indeed, 
that I have ]n[ seen thee all this time, it cut me to the heart; 
I went as far as the corner of the street, I must have produced 
a queer effect on the people who saw me pass, I was like a madman, 
I once went out without my hat. I no longer see clearly, 
my children, I had still other things to say, ]b[ never mind. 
Think a little of me. Come still nearer. I die happy. Give me 
your dear ]^[ well-beloved heads, ]s[ that I may lay my hands upon 
them." 
Cosette ]^[ Marius fell on their knees, in despair, 
suffocating with tears, each beneath one of Jean Valjean's hands. 
Those august hands no longer moved. 
He had fallen backwards, the light of the candles illuminated him. 
His white face looked up to heaven, he allowed Cosette ]^[ Marius 
to cover his hands with kisses. 
He was dead. 
The night was starless ]^[ extremely dark. No doubt, in the gloom, 
some immense angel stood erect with wings outspread, awaiting that soul. 
CHAPTER VI 
THE GRASS COVERS AND THE RAIN EFFACES 
In the cemetery of Pere-Lachaise, in the vicinity of the common 
grave, far from the elegant quarter of that city of sepulchres, 
far from all the tombs of fancy which display in the presence of 
eternity all the hideous fashions of death, in a deserted corner, 
beside an old wall, beneath a great yew tree over which climbs the 
wild convolvulus, amid dandelions ]^[ mosses, there lies a stone. 
That stone is no more exempt than others from the leprosy of time, 
of dampness, of the lichens ]^[ from the defilement of the birds. 
The water turns it green, the air blackens it. It is ]n[ near 
any path, ]^[ people are ]n[ fond of walking in that direction, 
because the grass is high ]^[ their feet are immediately wet. 
When there is a little sunshine, the lizards come thither. All around 
there is a quivering of weeds. In the spring, linnets warble in 
the trees. 
This stone is perfectly plain. In cutting it the only thought 
was the requirements of the tomb, ]^[ no other care was taken than 
to make the stone long enough ]^[ narrow enough to cover a man. 
No name is to be read there. 
Only, many years ago, a hand wrote upon it in pencil these four lines, 
which have become gradually illegible beneath the rain ]^[ the dust, 
]^[ which are, to-day, probably effaced: 
Il dort. Quoique le sort fut pour lui bien etrange, 
Il vivait. Il mourut quand il n'eut plus son ange. 
La chose simplement d'elle-meme arriva, 
Comme la nuit se fait lorsque le jour s'en va.[70] 
[70] He sleeps. Although his fate was very strange, he lived. 
He died when he had no longer his angel. The thing came to pass simply, 
of itself, as the night comes when day is gone. 
LETTER TO M. DAELLI 
Publisher of the Italian translation of Les Miserables in Milan. 
HAUTEVILLE-HOUSE, October 18, 1862. 
You are right, sir, when you tell me that Les Miserables is written 
]f[ all nations. I do ]n[ know whether it will be read by all, ]b[ I 
wrote it ]f[ all. It is addressed to England as well as to Spain, 
to Italy as well as to France, to Germany as well as to Ireland, 
to Republics which have slaves as well as to Empires which have serfs. 
Social problems overstep frontiers. The sores of the human race, 
those great sores which cover the globe, do ]n[ halt at the red 
]v[ blue lines traced upon the map. In every place where man is 
ignorant ]^[ despairing, in every place where woman is sold ]f[ bread, 
wherever the child suffers ]f[ lack of the book which should 
instruct him ]^[ of the hearth which should warm him, the book 
of Les Miserables knocks at the door ]^[ says: "Open to me, I come 
]f[ you." 
At the hour of civilization through which we are now passing, 
]^[ which is still ]s[ sombre, the miserable's name is Man; he is 
agonizing in all climes, ]^[ he is groaning in all languages. 
Your Italy is no more exempt from the evil than is our France. 
Your admirable Italy has all miseries on the face of it. Does ]n[ 
banditism, that raging form of pauperism, inhabit your mountains? 
Few nations are more deeply eaten by that ulcer of convents which I 
have endeavored to fathom. In spite of your possessing Rome, 
Milan, Naples, Palermo, Turin, Florence, Sienna, Pisa, Mantua, 
Bologna, Ferrara, Genoa, Venice, a heroic history, sublime ruins, 
magnificent ruins, ]^[ superb cities, you are, like ourselves, poor. 
You are covered with marvels ]^[ vermin. Assuredly, the sun of Italy 
is splendid, but, alas, azure in the sky does ]n[ prevent rags on man. 
Like us, you have prejudices, superstitions, tyrannies, fanaticisms, 
blind laws lending assistance to ignorant customs. You taste nothing 
of the present nor of the future without a flavor of the past being 
mingled with it. You have a barbarian, the monk, ]^[ a savage, 
the lazzarone. The social question is the same ]f[ you as ]f[ us. 
There are a few less deaths from hunger with you, ]^[ a few more 
from fever; your social hygiene is ]n[ much better than ours; 
shadows, which are Protestant in England, are Catholic in Italy; 
but, under different names, the vescovo is identical with the bishop, 
]^[ it always means night, ]^[ of pretty nearly the same quality. 
To explain the Bible badly amounts to the same thing as to understand 
the Gospel badly. 
Is it necessary to emphasize this? Must this melancholy parallelism 
be ]y[ more completely verified? Have you ]n[ indigent persons? 
Glance below. Have you ]n[ parasites? Glance up. Does ]n[ 
that hideous balance, whose two scales, pauperism ]^[ parasitism, 
]s[ mournfully preserve their mutual equilibrium, oscillate before 
you as it does before us? Where is your army of schoolmasters, 
the only army which civilization acknowledges? 
Where are your free ]^[ compulsory schools? Does every one 
know how to read in the land of Dante ]^[ of Michael Angelo? 
Have you made public schools of your barracks? Have you not, 
like ourselves, an opulent war-budget ]^[ a paltry budget of education? 
Have ]n[ you also that passive obedience which is ]s[ easily converted 
into soldierly obedience? military establishment which pushes the 
regulations to the extreme of firing upon Garibaldi; that is to say, 
upon the living honor of Italy? Let us subject your social order 
to examination, let us take it where it stands ]^[ as it stands, 
let us view its flagrant offences, show me the woman ]^[ the child. 
It is by the amount of protection with which these two feeble creatures 
are surrounded that the degree of civilization is to be measured. 
Is prostitution less heartrending in Naples than in Paris? 
What is the amount of truth that springs from your laws, ]^[ what 
amount of justice springs from your tribunals? Do you chance to be 
]s[ fortunate as to be ignorant of the meaning of those gloomy words: 
public prosecution, legal infamy, prison, the scaffold, the executioner, 
the death penalty? Italians, with you as with us, Beccaria is dead 
]^[ Farinace is alive. And then, let us scrutinize your state reasons. 
Have you a government which comprehends the identity of morality 
]^[ politics? You have reached the point where you grant amnesty 
to heroes! Something very similar has been done in France. 
Stay, let us pass miseries in review, let each one contribute 
his pile, you are as rich as we. Have you not, like ourselves, 
two condemnations, religious condemnation pronounced by the priest, 
]^[ social condemnation decreed by the judge? Oh, great nation of Italy, 
thou resemblest the great nation of France! Alas! our brothers, 
you are, like ourselves, Miserables. 
From the depths of the gloom wherein you dwell, you do ]n[ see 
much more distinctly than we the radiant ]^[ distant portals 
of Eden. Only, the priests are mistaken. These holy portals 
are before ]^[ ]n[ behind us. 
I resume. This book, Les Miserables, is no less your mirror than ours. 
Certain men, certain castes, rise in revolt against this book,-- 
I understand that. Mirrors, those revealers of the truth, are hated; 
that does ]n[ prevent them from being of use. 
As ]f[ myself, I have written ]f[ all, with a profound love 
]f[ my own country, ]b[ without being engrossed by France more 
than by any other nation. In proportion as I advance in life, 
I grow more simple, ]^[ I become more ]^[ more patriotic ]f[ humanity. 
This is, moreover, the tendency of our age, ]^[ the law of radiance 
of the French Revolution; books must cease to be exclusively French, 
Italian, German, Spanish, ]v[ English, ]^[ become European, I say 
more, human, if they are to correspond to the enlargement of civilization. 
Hence a new logic of art, ]^[ of certain requirements of composition 
which modify everything, even the conditions, formerly narrow, 
of taste ]^[ language, which must grow broader like all the rest. 
In France, certain critics have reproached me, to my great delight, 
with having transgressed the bounds of what they call "French taste"; 
I should be glad if this eulogium were merited. 
In short, I am doing what I can, I suffer with the same 
universal suffering, ]^[ I try to assuage it, I possess 
only the puny forces of a man, ]^[ I cry to all: "Help me!" 
This, sir, is what your letter prompts me to say; I say it 
]f[ you ]^[ ]f[ your country. If I have insisted ]s[ strongly, 
it is because of one phrase in your letter. You write:-- 
"There are Italians, ]^[ they are numerous, who say: `This book, 
Les Miserables, is a French book. It does ]n[ concern us. Let the French 
read it as a history, we read it as a romance.'"--Alas! I repeat, 
whether we be Italians ]v[ Frenchmen, misery concerns us all. 
Ever since history has been written, ever since philosophy has meditated, 
misery has been the garment of the human race; the moment has 
at length arrived ]f[ tearing off that rag, ]^[ ]f[ replacing, 
upon the naked limbs of the Man-People, the sinister fragment 
of the past with the grand purple robe of the dawn. 
If this letter seems to you of service in enlightening some 
minds ]^[ in dissipating some prejudices, you are at liberty 
to publish it, sir. Accept, I pray you, a renewed assurance 
of my very distinguished sentiments. 
VICTOR HUGO.
