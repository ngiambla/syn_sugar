Abstract—We consider implementing FPGAs using a standard 
cell design methodology, ]^[ present a framework ]f[ the 
automated generation of synthesizable FPGA fabrics. The opensource Verilog-to-Routing (VTR) FPGA architecture evaluation 
framework [1] is extended to generate synthesizable Verilog ]f[ its 
in-memory FPGA architectural device model. The Verilog can be 
synthesized into standard cells, placed ]^[ routed using an ASIC 
design flow. A second extension to VTR generates a configuration 
bitstream ]f[ the FPGA; that is, the bitstream configures the 
FPGA to realize a user-provided placed ]^[ routed design. The 
proposed framework ]^[ methodology opens the door to silicon 
implementation of a wide range of VTR-modelled FPGA fabrics. 
In an experimental study, area ]^[ timing-optimized FPGA 
implementations in 65nm TSMC standard cells are compared

I. 
I NTRODUCTION 
Standard cell design methodologies are prevalent in the 
design of modern digital ICs, owing to the high costs associated with manual layout ]^[ increasingly complicated design 
rules in deep sub-100nm technologies. Entire processors [2] 
]^[ other digital blocks such as PLLs [3] are nowadays mainly 
synthesized from RTL, as opposed to hand designed at a lower 
level of abstraction. Field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) 
are one of the few remaining classes of digital IC incorporating 
a considerable amount of custom layout. The core logic ]^[ 
interconnect tiles in commercial FPGAs are laid out manually, 
motivated by intense pressure to optimize area, delay ]^[ 
power in the underlying circuitry, as such tiles are stamped 
out hundreds-to-thousands of times on each die. In this paper, 
we consider implementing FPGAs in standard cells ]^[ assess 
the gap between a synthesized standard cell ]^[ a full custom 
commercial FPGA implementation. 
To realize a standard cell FPGA implementation, we have 
developed a synthesizable FPGA fabric generator within the 
open-source Verilog-to-Routing (VTR) [1] toolsuite from the 
University of Toronto. VTR is capable of modelling ]^[ 
mapping circuits into a wide variety of different FPGA architectures. Our generator produces synthesizable Verilog ]f[ 
VTR’s in-memory FPGA device model. As such, our generator 
is ]n[ locked into a single FPGA architecture, ]b[ rather, is 
able to produce Verilog ]f[ a spectrum of different FPGAs, ]f[ 
example, with different numbers of look-up-tables (LUTs) per 
logic block, different numbers of tracks per routing channel, 
]v[ even different switch block connectivities. In addition to 
producing synthesizable Verilog, we have also extended VTR 
to produce a configuration bitstream ]f[ a user design implemented within the synthesizable FPGA. While the conventional 
approach used by commercial vendors involves adding CAD 
support ]f[ each new FPGA device; in our case, we have built 
“silicon support” ]f[ an existing ]^[ well established FPGA 
architecture/CAD evaluation toolsuite – VTR. 
In addition to the advantages associated with synthesis 
vs. custom layout, the proposed synthesizable FPGA fabric 
generator offers a number of benefits. First, it enables VTRmodelled FPGAs to be realized in silicon, democratizing 
access to FPGA technology. Specifically, our VTR-based approach circumvents a major impediment to the development 
of new FPGAs, namely, the complexity ]^[ cost associated 
with building CAD tools that can map user circuits into them. 
Second, the synthesizable FPGAs can be easily ported to 
new process technologies, by re-synthesizing using a new cell 
library. Third, the FPGA fabrics we generate are straightforward to incorporate into an SoC; the FPGA module can be 
instantiated within the surrounding circuitry, ]^[ the layout 
shape/aspect ratio of the FPGA tiles can be tailored according 
to the overall SoC floorplan. 
We synthesize FPGA fabrics into TSMC 65nm standard 
cells. Through constraints supplied to the ASIC design tools 
(Synopsys Design Compiler ]^[ Cadence Encounter), we 
produce area-optimized, timing-optimized ]^[ balanced FPGA 
fabric implementations. In an experimental study, we supply 
VTR with an architecture model closely resembling Altera’s 
Stratix III device, ]^[ compare the area ]^[ delay of the 
synthesized standard cell FPGA with Stratix III, which is also 
implemented in 65nm. The contributions of this paper are:

synthesized standard cell FPGAs and, to the authors’ 
knowledge, the first published study comparing a

subsequent sections. The VTR-based synthesizable fabric ]^[

BACKGROUND AND R ELATED W ORK 
A. Verilog-to-Routing (VTR) 
VTR [1] is an open-source FPGA architecture evaluation/CAD framework from the University of Toronto, comprising of RTL synthesis, logic synthesis, packing, placement, 
routing ]^[ timing/power analysis, as shown in Fig. 1. The 
inputs to VTR are: 1) a description of an FPGA architecture, 
]^[ 2) an application benchmark ]f[ implementation in the

VTR permits heterogeneity, where columns of blocks may be 
of different types; ]f[ example, LUT-based soft logic blocks, 
DSP blocks, ]^[ memories. Within each of these types, an 
architect has a wide range of choices. For example, with soft 
logic blocks, one can vary the # of LUTs/block, whether 
the LUTs are fracturable [5] vs. non-fracturable, the richness 
of the internal local crossbar, the number of FFs, ]^[ ]s[ 
on. VTR also supports the notion of modes, which represent 
mutually exclusive ways in which a block may function. For 
example, a fracturable LUT may operate in single-output mode 
(implementing a single logic function) ]v[ dual-output mode 
(implementing two logic functions).

FPGA architectural components. 
FPGA. The architectural description is written in humanreadable XML, ]^[ through this, an architect can specify both 
the interconnect ]^[ logic architecture of the target FPGA. 
VTR’s internal CAD algorithms are “generic” in the sense 
that specific architectural details are ]n[ hard-coded into the 
algorithms themselves – the algorithms are designed to do a 
reasonably good job implementing the application benchmark 
in a range of architectures. Note that prior to the current 
work, the VTR flow terminated at the routing stage; it was ]n[ 
possible to realize a silicon implementation of a VTR-modelled 
architecture. Our work extends VTR to produce synthesizable 
Verilog ]f[ VTR’s in-memory architectural device model, as 
well as a bitstream ]f[ the application benchmark implemented 
in the device. 
B. FPGA Architecture 
VTR is able to model island-style FPGAs [4], a two 
dimensional array of logic blocks with horizontal ]^[ vertical 
routing channels, surrounded by a ring of I/Os. The key 
architectural components necessary to understand this paper 
are shown in Fig. 2. Switch blocks allow horizontal ]^[ vertical 
routing tracks to be programmably connected with one another; 
connection blocks allow logic block pins to connect to adjacent 
routing tracks. Logic blocks generally contain one ]v[ more 
look-up-tables (LUTs) ]^[ flip-flops (FFs), ]^[ an internal 
crossbar ]f[ making local connections. 
With respect to routing, VTR allows one to change the 
number of tracks per channel, wire directionality, the wire 
segment lengths ]^[ relative frequency of wires of a given 
length, the connectivity between horizontal ]^[ vertical wires, 
]^[ the way wires connect to logic block pins. For logic, 
Several recent works bear similarity to our own in that 
they propose to synthesize FPGA fabrics targetable by VTR. 
Chaudhuri et al. [6] focuses on embedding a reconfigurable 
FPGA in a system-on-chip (SoC), ]^[ enhance the area ]^[ 
performance through floorplanning [7]. Liu [8] studies the impact of the FPGA architectural parameters on the synthesized 
components of the FPGA. In both of these works, there is little 
detail on the issues that arise from using ASIC design tools. 
Moreover, none of these works show a suite of benchmark 
designs being verified as functional within the synthesized 
fabric, nor do they compare the synthesized standard cell 
implementation with a commercial FPGA. 
In another work, Aken’Ova [9] investigated island-style 
FPGAs ]^[ improved area ]^[ delay gap by using “tactical 
cells” [10] ]^[ floorplanning [11]. The author thoroughly 
describes architecture changes ]^[ solutions to overcome ASIC 
design flow problems. However, there is little discussion on the 
generation of the architecture ]^[ bitstream. 
Other work has focussed on standard cell implementations 
of application-specific FPGA architectures. An early work 
by Phillips ]^[ Hauck [12] synthesized the reconfigurablepipelined datapath (RaPiD) [13] architecture using standard 
cells. The authors observe that customizing the architecture 
]f[ domain-specific applications, as well as including some 
FPGA-specific standard cells into the library improves area 
]^[ performance. Kafafi et al. [14] synthesizes a combinational 
]^[ directional architecture ]^[ reports a large area difference 
relative to a custom-layout design. In work by Wilton et 
al. [15], the authors synthesize a datapath-oriented FPGA 
fabric with a directional routing architecture. Unlike these 
past works, which deal with non-standard FPGA architectures, 
we focus on architectures that resemble today’s commercial 
FPGAs ]^[ that are already supported by the VTR framework. 
III. 
A RCHITECTURE AND B ITSTREAM G ENERATION 
VPR [16] is the portion of the VTR flow that performs 
packing, placement ]^[ routing. From the user-supplied architectural description, VPR builds an in-memory representation 
of the entire FPGA device, including all logic ]^[ interconnect. 
The packing, placement ]^[ routing steps in VPR implement 
the application benchmark in the in-memory FPGA device 
model. Our synthesizable Verilog generator is built within 
VPR ]^[ executes at the end of the routing step. Essentially, 
our generator code “walks” the in-memory device model to 
produce synthesizable Verilog, ]^[ likewise, by examining 
the application benchmark’s implementation in the device, we 
produce a configuration bitstream ]f[ the FPGA. We elaborate 
on these steps below.

Synthesizable FPGA verification flow. 
MUX inference within a logic block. 
A. Generating Synthesizable Verilog 
As a first step, we hand-wrote Verilog ]f[ two FPGA 
primitives: a FF, ]^[ a Stratix III-like fracturable LUT (see 
Section V). Subsequently, we automatically generate Verilog 
]f[ the entire FPGA device, a structural netlist of these 
primitives, as well as other primitives which are generated by 
our generator code: multiplexers (MUXs) of any size, LUTs 
with any number of inputs. The generation must handle the 
following: logic blocks, intra-logic block routing, inter-logic 
block routing, ]^[ configuration cell memory. 
Logic Blocks: Logic blocks in VPR are represented in 
memory as a tree; the tree root represents the entire logic block, 
nodes at intermediate levels of the tree represent levels of 
hierarchy in the block, ]^[ the leaves represent the primitives 
(LUTs ]^[ FFs). We generate the Verilog ]f[ each logic block 
by first traversing to the leaf nodes. We then move up the tree 
and, as we visit each node in the hierarchy, its child nodes 
are defined ]^[ instantiated in the output Verilog. The Verilog 
generated ]f[ a logic block has the same hierarchy specified 
by the architect in the architecture file. 
Intra-Logic Block Routing: Routing within a logic block is 
stored in memory as a graph, where nodes represent pins (on 
primitives ]v[ on intermediate levels of hierarchy) ]^[ directed 
edges represent connections between pins. For a given pin, 
if there is more than one incoming edge, a routing MUX 
is inferred. The select inputs to the MUX will be driven by 
configuration cells (discussed below). Fig. 3 highlights examples of routing MUX inference within a logic block. Crossbars 
with varying degrees of connectivity can be generated, since 
VPR only creates edges in its in-memory model ]f[ those 
connections that exist. 
Inter-Logic Block Routing: Routing that connects the logic 
blocks is likewise represented in memory as a graph. In this 
case, the nodes represent the wire segments ]^[ pins. Edges 
represent programmable connections between such conductors. 
As above, where there exists more than one edge to a node, 
MUXs are inferred. These MUXs correspond to the connectivity within switch blocks ]^[ connection blocks (Fig. 2). VPR 
does ]n[ model the inter-logic block routing hierarchically 
– there is no notion of switch block ]v[ connection block 
within VPR’s in-memory model. Consequently, each MUX is 
instantiated in our Verilog without hierarchy. 
Configuration Cells: As MUXs that implement programmable connectivity are being instantiated, configuration 
cells that drive their select inputs must also be instantiated ]^[ 
attached accordingly. We use “fully encoded” MUXs, meaning, 
a 4-to-1 MUX will have two configuration bits. Other styles of 
MUX (e.g. flattened MUXs that use more configuration cells 
]^[ have fewer levels from input-to-output) are left to consider 
in future work. We use a FF to implement each configuration 
cell. Then, the cells are connected in a chain, like a shift 
register. Similarly, ]f[ the LUTs in logic blocks, we instantiate 
configuration cells to hold the LUT’s truth table contents. 
B. Bitstream Generation 
The configuration bitstream is an ordered sequence of 
0’s ]^[ 1’s that configures the FPGA according to the implementation of the application benchmark. Since the configuration cells are connected together in a chain, the 0/1 
values shifted in ]f[ the benchmark’s implementation must 
align exactly with the ordering of cells in the chain. Thus, to 
create the configuration bitstream ]f[ a design, our generator 
walks the device model in precisely the same order as is 
used to generate the synthesizable Verilog. The in-memory 
implementation of the benchmark is used to assign 0/1 values 
in the bitstream. For example, consider a 4-to-1 interconnect 
MUX whose inputs are numbered 0, 1, 2, 3. The path selected 
through the MUX will be controlled by two configuration 
cells. Assuming that VPR has routed a signal through input 
#1, the two configuration cell values in the stream will be 
01. Regarding bitstream generation, there were two challenges 
worth highlighting discussed below. 
Input ]^[ Output Equivalence: VPR supports input ]^[ 
output pin equivalence (essentially “pin swapping”). This 
means that as we generate the bitstream, we have to account 
]f[ any change in the ordering of the inputs ]v[ outputs that may 
have occurred during routing. For example, consider a MUX 
within the intra-logic block crossbar. At the packing stage, 
VPR may have used the ith input to the MUX ]f[ a logic 
signal; however, the VPR router may end up instead using the 
j th input ]f[ the signal (e.g. ]f[ timing/routability reasons). 
During bitstream generation, we account ]f[ such changes by 
examining the routing paths actually used by nets ]^[ do ]n[ 
rely on the packed (pre-routed) netlist. 
Fracturable LUTs: When LUTs are ]n[ fracturable, we 
may assume that unused inputs are grounded ]^[ we configure 
the LUT truth table accordingly. However, with fracturable 
LUTs, we must account ]f[ inputs that are shared between the 
LUTs. For example, fracturable LUTs in Altera commercial 
devices have 8 inputs, where two inputs are shared between 
the two LUTs. When one of the shared inputs is used in the 
first LUT, ]b[ unused in the second LUT, we can no longer 
assume that input to be grounded when we specify the truth 
table ]f[ the second LUT. The truth table ]f[ the second LUT 
must be set in such a way that the unused input is a “don’t 
care”: the LUT function must be correct regardless of whether 
the unused input is a 0 ]v[ a 1. This involves replicating the 
truth table contents ]f[ both possible logic states of the unused 
input. 
C. Functional Correctness 
Fig. 4 shows the verification flow. We developed a testbench wherein the original application benchmark RTL is 
simulated in ModelSim with random vectors. Within the same 
testbench, the FPGA device RTL, configured with the generated bitstream, is simulated with the same random vectors. 
Output values are checked ]f[ equality with each vector 
applied. Note that this verification flow was used to check 
correctness at all stages of the standard cell implementation: 
RTL generated by our VPR generator, post-technology mapping with Synopsys (discussed below), ]^[ post-layout with 
Cadence (also discussed below). 
D. Supported Architectures 
Presently, our tool is able to generate synthesizable Verilog 
]f[ FPGAs comprised of LUT/FF-based logic blocks, interconnect ]^[ I/Os. Support ]f[ other types of blocks, such as 
DSP ]v[ RAM blocks, is left as future work. We support LUTs 
that are either fracturable ]v[ non-fracturable. In fact, LUT 
fracturability is the only form of VTR “modes” supported by 
our tool. The modes feature in VTR allows an architect to describe mutually exclusive functionality ]f[ a given block. The 
specification of modes does ]n[ contain information regarding 
how such functionality should be implemented in hardware, 
nor is it obvious how it could be inferred automatically by a 
tool such as ours. 
Aside from these limitations, our tool supports Verilog/bitstream generation ]f[ all VTR-targetable architectures 
– made possible by the approach described above, which 
walks VTR’s in-memory device model. For example, we 
are able to handle: any # of LUTs/logic block, any switch 
block/connection block connectivity, wire segments of various 
lengths, fully ]v[ partially populated crossbars within logic 
blocks. 
IV. 
S TANDARD C ELL ASIC I MPLEMENTATION 
We use an ASIC design flow to synthesize, place, route, 
]^[ analyze the circuit, as summarized in Fig. 5. We used 
Synopsys Design Compiler to synthesize the FPGA to standard 
cells. Cadence Encounter is used ]f[ placement ]^[ routing. 
Synopsys PrimeTime is used ]f[ timing analysis. 
A. Synthesis to Standard Cells 
We evaluated several different synthesis strategies: topdown, “uniquify”, ]v[ bottom-up. The top-down method is a 
push-button approach where there entire design is synthesized 
in “one shot”. However, since it processes the whole design at 
once, it is too run-time ]^[ memory intensive to be a viable 
approach ]f[ a large design. In fact, ]f[ a 20 × 20 FPGA with 
300 tracks per channel, Design Compiler could ]n[ successfully synthesize using the top-down approach. The uniquify 
approach allows one to break up the design ]^[ compile 
each instance separately. This approach worked, however, it is 
again run-time intensive, as each instance of the same Verilog 
module (e.g. a 6-LUT) is compiled individually. We therefore 
chose the bottom-up approach, in which each required Verilog 
module is synthesized just once, ]^[ the synthesized instances 
are stitched together to compose the overall synthesized design. 
While the bottom-up method produces a more regular 
implementation ]^[ brings run-time benefits, its weakness is 
that each type of module is synthesized in isolation; i.e. outside 
of the context of the other modules it connects to when 
instantiated in the overall FPGA. For example, consider that 
]f[ a length-16 wire, it may be truncated at the edge of the 
FPGA, depending on the location from which it is driven. 
Length-16 wires truncated at different points will all exhibit 
different load capacitances, ]^[ it is undesirable to synthesize 
a separate/different driver to be used ]f[ each variant of 
Fig. 5. 
ASIC design flow. 
truncated length-16 wire. Thus, to handle these issues that arise 
from routing MUXs driving various-length wires, we did the 
following: 1) we synthesize a single MUX of each size; 2) 
we insert a fixed-size buffer1 on the output of each MUX to 
create a consistent load on the MUX output; ]^[ 3) we insert a 
fixed-size buffer every 2 tiles on inter-logic block interconnect 
wires, ensuring a roughly uniform load ]f[ each buffer. 
Design Compiler accepts area ]^[ timing constraints, 
permitting one to trade-off performance vs. area ]f[ a single RTL design by changing constraints. In our experimental study (Section V), we have synthesized area-optimized, 
timing-optimized ]^[ balanced FPGAs. Optimizing ]f[ area is 
straightforward: we direct Design Compiler to achieve a target 
area of 0. Optimizing ]f[ timing is more involved, owing to 
the fact that FPGAs contain many combinational loops before 
being programmed. Such loops are problematic ]f[ timing 
analysis, ]^[ they must be “broken” prior to timing-constrained 
synthesis. The loops exist within both inter- ]^[ intra-logic 
block routing, ]^[ combinations of these. Fig. 6 ]^[ Fig. 7 
show examples of combinational loops ]^[ how we break 
such loops (via generated constraints provided to Synopsys). In 
essence, after breaking such loops ]^[ by using the bottom-up 
synthesis approach, we are able to produce a timing-optimized 
implementation of each module; however, all possible timing 
paths through the overall FPGA (i.e. across modules) are ]n[ 
optimized globally. Nevertheless, results in the next section 
demonstrate significantly improved performance in the timingoptimized implementations. Note that timing constraints are 
only applied to paths through which logic signals may propagate in an application implementation. We do ]n[ apply timing 
constraints to the configuration cells, ]v[ paths to/from such 
cells. The content of such cells only changes when the device 
is configured; hence, they are ]n[ performance critical. 
B. Place ]^[ Route 
Placement ]^[ routing proceeds in a flat manner, allowing 
optimization across the module boundaries. To help the placer, 
we guide our design using floorplanning. By default, we set 
floorplanning constraints assuming a chip aspect ratio of 1 
(square die) ]^[ 85% utilization (as Kuon ]^[ Rose discussed [17]). Note that total cell area is known after synthesis 
to standard cells, making it possible to define a die size with 
any given utilization ratio. 
1 The Cadence Encounter router also has capabilities ]f[ automatic buffer 
insertion (command optDesign), however, because of the size of the design 
being placed ]^[ routed, the router-based buffer insertion repeatedly crashed 
on our server. We therefore opted to insert buffers during synthesis. 
Fig. 8. 
Fig. 6. 
Combinational loop in inter-logic block routing. 
Fig. 7. 
Combinational loop in logic block. 
We found that floorplanning was mandatory to ensure that 
the physical layout of logic ]^[ routing tiles, in terms of 
ordering in the horizontal ]^[ vertical dimensions, matched 
with that assumed by VPR. Without this, Encounter produced 
layouts where, ]f[ example, logic blocks that VPR saw as 
adjacent, were actually placed far apart in the layout. Fig. 8 
is an example of how configuration cells will drift towards 
each other due to their connectivity ]^[ how two logic blocks 
that are intended to be adjacent to one another can get 
separated. For floorplanning the individual modules, we evenly 
divide up the chip ]^[ constrain our logic blocks ]^[ the 
connection MUXs connected to these logic blocks in the 
appropriate areas. On top of this grid, we overlay another 
grid to floorplan the switch MUXs in the appropriate areas. 
The Cadence placer allows one to control the rigidity of the 
floorplanning constraints, specifically, whether cells are allow 
to enter/exit each floorplanning region. We set this to the most 
flexible scheme possible, where the floorplanning constraints 
are used as a guide to the placer, ]b[ cells may exit/enter the 
specified regions. All of the floorplanning TCL commands are 
automatically generated at the same time Verilog description 
of the FPGA is generated. 
Once the designs have been placed ]^[ routed, parasitic 
capacitances are extracted ]f[ use by PrimeTime to obtain accurate post-layout timing analysis. Also, at this point, a GDSII 
file can be written that contains all the mask information. 
C. Timing Analysis 
Synopsys PrimeTime is used ]f[ post-layout timing analysis of: 1) specific paths within the implementation, ]v[ 2) 
Floorplanned (left) ]^[ unfloorplanned (right) layouts. 
an application benchmark programmed on the FPGA. PrimeTime accepts as input the design, annotated with parasitic 
capacitance information, as well as an SDC (Synopsys design 
constraints) file. The SDC file specifies which timing paths 
should be ignored. For 1), we ignore all paths ]b[ the specific 
paths we wish to analyze (see next section) ]^[ run timing 
analysis to obtain their delay. For 2) finding the critical path of 
an application benchmark implemented within the fabric, the 
process is more involved. Commercial FPGA vendors provide 
static timing analysis tools that analyze the performance ]f[ 
user designs implemented in their FPGAs, using delay models 
of the underlying fabric. To mimic the behavior of such 
tools ]f[ an application implemented within our synthesized 
fabric, we devised the following approach: during bitstream 
generation (Section III-B), we have precise knowledge about 
which FPGA resources are used vs. unused. For each unused 
resource, we automatically generate an SDC constraint to 
disable timing analysis through the resource. When PrimeTime 
is invoked to analyze performance of the FPGA device configured with the application bitstream, PrimeTime “sees” only 
those paths in the used part of the FPGA (which should be 
free of combinational loops, assuming well-designed circuits). 
The critical path reported by PrimeTime is then analogous to 
that reported by the timing analysis tools of commercial FPGA 
vendors. It is important to note that once the FPGA device has 
been synthesized, placed ]^[ routed, timing analysis can be 
done ]f[ any application benchmark by providing PrimeTime 
with the bitstream ]^[ SDC file ]f[ that benchmark. Meaning, 
it is ]n[ necessary to synthesize, place ]^[ route the FPGA 
device on an individual benchmark-by-benchmark basis. 
A challenge we had to deal with regarding PrimeTime arose 
due to our bottom-up synthesis strategy ]^[ the delay model of 
the standard cells. PrimeTime reported warnings (RC-009) that 
in some cases, timing results may be inaccurate as cell drive 
resistance was too small in comparison with the impedance 
of the driven network. Recall that in the bottom-up synthesis 
style, in some cases, Synopsys technology mapping must select 
cells of a certain size without global context/knowledge of the 
total RC load driven by such cells. This mainly occurred ]f[ 
large cells driving long interconnect wires, ]^[ we were able 
to eliminate all warnings through the buffer insertion discussed 
previously.

published Stratix IV architecture capture by Murray et al. [18], 
where authors attempted to model Stratix IV within VTR2 . 
Our synthesized FPGA has dimensions of 20 × 20 logic 
blocks, with 10 fracturable LUTs/block. There are 300 routing 
tracks/channel, where 87% of tracks span 4 tiles, ]^[ 13% span 
16 tiles. F cin /F cout refer to the fraction of adjacent tracks a 
logic block input/output pin may programmably connect to. 
Within the logic block, the crossbar is 50% populated. We 
are using fracturable 6-LUTs with 8 inputs, which implies 2shared inputs in dual-output mode, similar to the extensive 
architecture described in [19]. Such LUTs can implement any 
single function of up to 6 variables, ]v[ any two functions that 
together, use no more than 8 unique variables. We reinforce 
that although in this study we focus on a particular synthesized 
fabric comparable with Stratix III, our generator is able to 
automatically produce RTL ]f[ a variety of VTR-supported 
architectures. 
We synthesized three variants of the architecture described 
above: area-optimized, timing-optimized ]^[ balanced. For 
area-optimized, we directed Synopsys to minimize area ]^[ 
imposed no timing constraints. For the timing-optimized, we 
conversely directed Synopsys to minimize delay, ]^[ imposed 
no area constraints. For the balanced, we took the mid-point 
of the achieved delays between the area ]^[ timing-optimized 
]^[ set these as the target delays ]f[ Synopsys. Fig. 9 shows 
one of the synthesized FPGA fabric layouts. 
In a first set of experiments, we examine the area ]^[ 
performance (of specific paths) of the synthesized FPGA 
]^[ compare with analogous area ]^[ performance data ]f[ 
Stratix III. This first set of experiments is thus agnostic to 
any particular application design being implemented within 
the fabric – it is a fabric-to-fabric comparison. In a second set 
of experiments, we compare the performance of application 
benchmark designs implemented on our fabric to those same 
designs implemented on Stratix III. 
We consider various combinational ]^[ sequential benchmarks from the MCNC benchmark suite [20]. Since we are 
using the full VTR flow, we omitted some designs from 
the 20 largest MCNC benchmarks where VTR swept away 
unconnected nodes (as these circuits caused problems ]f[ our 
verification flow which relied on I/O matching). In addition to 
the MCNC circuits, we added a finite state machine (FSM) that 
detects a pattern, ]^[ also an adder connected to a shift register. 
These latter two circuits were used mainly ]f[ debugging 
purposes. We use the MCNC circuits in this initial study, 
as these can be simulated with random vectors ]^[ verified 
with the flow in Fig. 4. Other benchmark suites, such as the 
VTR suite, contain DSP blocks ]^[ RAMs, ]^[ are more 
challenging to simulate/verify, owing to the circuits having 
reset/control inputs. 
2 While Stratix IV is on a more advanced process than Stratix III, the soft 
logic block ]^[ routing architectures are similar.

Synthesized FPGA. 
A. Area Analysis 
We compare the tile area of our synthesized FPGA to 
Altera’s Stratix III. The tile area of our FPGA was obtained 
by dividing total die area by the number of logic blocks 
(20 × 20 = 400). Table II summarizes the tile area of the 
three architectures. Stratix III LAB tile area is reported to be 
0.0221mm2 by [21]. The area-optimized fabric resulted in the 
smallest tile area of 0.0316mm2 , which is 1.5× bigger than 
Stratix III. As expected, the timing-optimized ]^[ balanced 
fabrics were larger: 2.9× ]^[ 1.9× bigger than Stratix III, respectively. We were encouraged by the area of the synthesized 
fabrics, especially the area-optimized, which is relatively close 
to Stratix III. 
A number of factors contribute to the area difference 
vs. Stratix III. First, there are architectural differences. For 
example, our architecture does ]n[ support carry-chains nor 
are our MUXs fully-decoded. Second, our implementation uses 
only those standard cells in the TSMC library. In commercial 
FPGAs, pass-transistors ]v[ transmission gates are commonly 
used to implement MUXs ]^[ LUTs; however, we use full 
CMOS implementations of these primitives. Likewise, we are 
also using FFs ]f[ the configuration cells rather than SRAM 
cells (as we expect is done in a commercial device). Perhaps 
most importantly, the Stratix III LAB is custom laid-out. 
Delving further into the area results, Fig. 10 shows the 
breakdown of area into logic, inter- ]^[ intra-logic block routing, ]^[ configuration ]f[ each fabric type. In area-optimized 
design, configuration cells built of costly FFs in our case, 
occupy a large portion of the area: 42% of the total. It is 
likewise ]n[ surprising that routing comprises 50% of the fabric 
area, since we are using standard cell-based MUXs, instead of 
pass-transistor-style MUXs. 
In the timing-optimized FPGA fabric, we observe that 
configuration cells are reduced to 21% of the total area. This 
is because the configuration area is kept constant by applying 
no timing constraints to the configuration cells (they are ]n[ 
performance critical). Routing area has increased to 67% of the 
area ]^[ logic area increased to 13%. Remember that in the 
timing-optimized fabric, we inserted extra buffers on the interlogic block wires. However, buffer area is ]n[ appreciable: 2% 
of the total.

In the balanced FPGA fabric, both timing ]^[ area constraints were applied, however, we give a more relaxed timing 
constraint to the routing circuitry to save area. This leads to 
logic taking up 31% (logic + config ]f[ logic) ]^[ routing 
taking up 69% (routing + config ]f[ routing + buffers) of the 
total area. Note that in the balanced fabric, we keep the LUTs 
timing constraint aggressive, since the LUT takes up a small 
portion of the total area. 
B. Timing Analysis 
We first examine the delay of commonly-used paths in 
the synthesized fabrics ]^[ Stratix III (application-agnostic 
analysis). Specifically, we looked at the following three paths: 
1) 
2) 
3) 
L0 : FF → crossbar → LUT → FF (within a logic 
block). 
L4 : FF → length-4 wire → crossbar → LUT → FF 
(a path of length 4). 
L16 : FF → length-16 wire → crossbar → LUT → 
FF (a path of length 16). 
Table III is a summary of average delay of these paths 
in 6 different areas of the FPGAs (in the four corners of 
the fabric, ]^[ also on the middle of the left/right sides). 
In the synthesized fabrics, we manually selected the 6 paths 
by creating an SDC file that reports the delay ]f[ each. In 
doing so, we are assured that our analysis reflects the use 
of a length-4 ]v[ length-16 wire, accordingly. For the Altera 
Stratix III delays, we use Altera’s LogicLock feature to place 
two connected flip-flops 4 ]v[ 16 logic blocks away from one 
another, ]^[ then use Altera’s TimeQuest tool ascertain the 
path delay. For our fabrics, within the logic blocks, we apply 
an SDC constraint ]s[ that we measure the path corresponding 
to the fastest LUT input; this is to be comparable to Altera,

since Quartus uses the input that results in the smallest delay. 
Note that ]f[ the timing results in this paper, we use the slowest 
speedgrade ]f[ Stratix III, ]^[ compare with slowest-processcorner analysis ]f[ our fabric. 
Comparing our timing-optimized implementation to 
Stratix III, the delay is 2.3× to 3.5× slower, with the gap 
being larger ]f[ longer wire lengths. The balanced fabric is 
1.8× to 4.7× slower, ]^[ the area-optimized fabric is 5× to 
11.2× slower than Stratix III. We believe the reason that the 
delay gap vs. Stratix III grows with wire length is related to 
the difficulty in handling long wires in the ASIC toolflow. 
The relative results between the synthesized fabrics are as 
expected: the area-optimized fabric is overall slower than the 
balanced design, ]^[ the balanced design is slower than the 
timing-optimized fabric, except ]f[ the L0 path. L0 reflects 
timing within a logic block; the inter-logic block routing 
MUXs are ]n[ included in the delay. The slightly lower delay 
in the balanced design may be due to the heuristic nature of 
ASIC mapping, placement, ]^[ routing tools. It may also be 
because in our fabric (unlike Stratix III), one MUX drives 
the output of a logic block to both feedback ]^[ inter-logic 
block routing paths. That output MUX is timing optimized in 
our balanced fabric implementation, ]y[ it sees a smaller load 
than in the timing-optimized fabric implementation. Similar 
to the area analysis, Fig. 11 shows a delay breakdown ]f[ 
the three types of paths ]f[ all architectures. The L4 ]^[ L16 
fabric delays are dominated by routing delay. This confirms 
that we need to use optimizations such as buffering to reduce 
the routing delay. 
In the second part of the performance study, we looked 
at how benchmark circuits perform on the synthesized FPGA 
vs. Stratix III. The same Verilog file is passed to each tool 
]f[ implementing the circuits on the FPGAs. We use the SDC 
file generated with the bitstream to “program” our synthesized 
FPGA as discussed in Section IV-C. Note that the results of 
this experiment are ]n[ solely reflective of the fabric speed, ]b[ 
also of the differences in architectures, ]^[ in the CAD tools 
supporting the architectures: open-source VTR vs. Altera’s

Altera’s, especially considering Stratix III is custom laid-out 
]^[ undoubtedly highly optimized. To our knowledge, this 
work represents the first comparison of a standard cell FPGA 
implementation to a commercial FPGA. The proposed VTRbased synthesizable FPGA generator opens the door to actual 
silicon implementation of FPGAs targetable by an established 
CAD tool. 
In the future, we would like to assess power consumption, 
]^[ extend architecture ]^[ bitstream generation to accept 
all architectures supported by VTR, including those with 
DSP blocks ]^[ memories. Further work is also needed to 
support designs with multiple clocks. Finally, we would like 
to explore the utility of adding custom library cells that are 
specifically tailored ]f[ FPGAs, particularly ]f[ efficient MUX 
]^[ configuration cell implementations.

Quartus II. Table IV lists the critical path delays reported by 
the tools. The reported critical path delays do ]n[ include clock 
skew nor I/O cell delays (only core logic ]^[ routing). 
In combinational designs (top part of table), both designs 
were given input-to-output delay constraints. On average, there 
is a ∼3.8× increase in delay between the timing-optimized 
]^[ Stratix III FPGAs (see geo. mean row at bottom of 
table). The delay gap between the two FPGAs increased 
from our architecture delay study above, likely due to the 
weaknesses of the open-source VTR flow vs. Quartus II. In 
the sequential designs (bottom part of table), the critical path 
delays reported include register-to-register ]^[ I/O paths. Most 
circuits show similar increase in delay as the combinational 
designs; however, the dsip ]^[ fsm benchmarks showed smaller 
increases of 1.5× to 2×. The critical paths of these circuits 
have fewer logic levels compared to the other designs. 
It is worthwhile to mention that one of the key advantages 
of a synthesizable FPGA fabric that is it permits the type of 
exploration done here: the ability to realize fabrics with different area/delay trade-offs from a single RTL source, simply 
by changing constraints provided to the ASIC tools. Such an 
exploration is highly costly if manual layout is required ]f[ 
each fabric.

C ONCLUSIONS AND F UTURE W ORK 
In this work, we propose to automatically generate synthesizable FPGA fabrics within the open-source FPGA CAD 
tool, VTR. The fabrics we generate are then synthesized, 
placed ]^[ routed using a standard ASIC design flow into a 
commercial standard cell library. We synthesized 3 variants 
of an FPGA fabric (modelled on Altera’s Stratix III) into 
65nm TSMC standard cells: timing-optimized, area-optimized, 
]^[ balanced. We compared the tile area of our smallest 
FPGA fabric (area-optimized) with Altera’s Stratix III ]^[ 
found our fabric used 1.5× more area. Our timing-optimized 
fabric required 3× more area than Stratix III. With respect 
to performance, the critical paths of designs implemented in 
our timing-optimized fabric are ∼3.8× longer, on average, 
than in Stratix III; however, in some benchmarks the delay 
gap was as low as 1.5×. Overall, we are encouraged by 
the silicon area ]^[ performance of our fabric relative to
