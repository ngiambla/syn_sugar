The electric power grid is one of the largest ]^[ most complex infrastructures ever built by mankind. Modern 
civilization depends on it ]f[ industry production, human mobility, ]^[ comfortable living. However, many critical 
technologies such as the 60 Hz transformers were developed at the beginning of the 20th century ]^[ have changed 
very little since then.1 The traditional unidirectional power from the generation to the customer through the 
transmission-distribution grid has also changed nominally, ]b[ it no longer meets the need of the 21st century market 
energy customers. On one hand, 128m US residential customers pay $15B/per month ]f[ their utility bill, ]y[ they 
have no option to select their energy supplier. In a world of where many traditional industries are transformed by 
digital Internet technology (Amazon, Ebay, Uber, Airbnb), the traditional electric energy market is lagging 
significantly behind. A move towards a true digital grid is needed. Such a digital grid requires a tight integration of the 
physical layer (energy ]^[ power) with digital ]^[ cyber information to allow an open ]^[ real time market akin to the 
world of e-commerce. Another major factor that is pushing ]f[ this radical transformation are the rapidly changing 
patterns in energy resources ownership ]^[ load flow. Driven by the decreasing cost in distributed solar, energy 
storage, electric vehicle, on site generation ]^[ microgrids, the high penetration of Distributed Energy Resource 
(DER) is shifting challenges substantially towards the edge of grid from the control point of view. The envisioned 
Digital Grid must facilitate the open competition ]^[ open innovation needed to accelerate of the adoption of new 
DER technologies while satisfying challenges in grid stability, data explosion ]^[ cyber security. 
The American Recovery ]^[ Reinvestment Act of 2009 was an unprecedented action to stimulate the economy ]^[ to 
modernize our nation’s energy ]^[ communication infrastructure ]^[ enhance energy independence. Under this act, 
the US Department of Energy ]^[ the electricity industry have jointly invested in 99 cost-shared projects involving 
more than 200 participating electric utilities ]^[ other organizations to modernize the electric grid, improve inter- 
operability, ]^[ collect an unprecedented level of data on smart grid operations ]^[ benefits. A new ]^[ substantial 
investment is needed to develop the new Digital Grid. Radical reductions in the cost of sensors, communication, 
information processing, cyber-security, ]^[ new regulatory policies in electricity markets are needed. Federal 
leadership is essential to break the logjam ]^[ encourage new approaches. The key is designing programs that drive 
change ]b[ leave plenty of room ]f[ ideas from unexpected sources. 
Challenges ]^[ Potential Solution 
There are many challenges to transform the power grid into a Digital Grid. The primary ones are listed as follows: 
1. 
Low marginal costs coupled with high initial capital costs are characteristic of traditional power generation. Today 
the ratio between running cost ]^[ capital cost is falling rapidly with the introduction of renewable generation, along 
with flexibility of resources such as storage ]^[ demand response. Standard economic theory predicts that price of 
power will collapse in this setting, which is indeed the case today. Wholesale prices ]f[ electric power in the U.S. ]^[ 
other parts of the world are frequently far below operating cost, ]^[ even negative prices are commonly observed. 
This trend ]^[ price volatility will discourage capital investment, which is why FERC ]^[ local authorities are 
searching ]f[ market designs that will encourage long-term investment. A holistic approach to market design that 
accommodates both surplus ]^[ shortage in renewables, combines them with other generation assets as well as 
storage, ]^[ includes design guidelines ]^[ incentives that enable short-term benefits of improved grid performance 
]^[ long-term benefits of sustainability ]^[ economic stability is highly warranted. Innovations in wholesale markets 
need to be accompanied by those in retail markets to accommodate multiple DG owners ]^[ aggregators. 
On the demand side, changes are needed due to the same reason as above, to accommodate intermittency ]^[

Data Analytics 
Grid Stability ]^[ Resiliency under High DER Penetration 
uncertainty in renewable generation. The standard practice of generation following load has to be shed, ]^[ loads need 
to be more dispatchable as well. This approach leads to the generalized concept of Demand Response, which needs to 
be integrated into the functioning of electricity markets. Direct Load Control ]^[ Transactive Control, the two 
methods that make up Demand Response are both highly promising methods that can help in shaping demand ]s[ as to 
coordinate fluctuations in renewables. Research is needed to ensure that consumer engagement will enhance rather 
than disrupt reliability of the grid. Further, automation of demand response is required to ensure grid reliability ]^[ 
also to ensure that each participant receives the benefits that are promised. For example, strict bounds on indoor 
temperature ]^[ humidity must be maintained. Market rules are required to ensure that players receive transparent 
incentives ]f[ services provided to the grid, even in the case of residential consumers who have little understanding of 
power systems ]v[ even their own fuse box. Given that all of the aforementioned innovations require real-time ]^[ 
reliable communication, a cyber-physical approach is essential to realize an efficient electricity market. 
2. 
The envisioned Digital Grid must be realized with no comprise to grid reliability ]^[ resilience. Since the Digital Grid 
is fundamentally supporting high DER penetration with very dynamic bidirectional power flows affected by the real- 
time market participation, the grand challenges in control is to achieve voltage ]^[ frequency stability, as well as 
intelligent protection. To address these issues as well as to the severe intermittence issue in the DER ]^[ the lack of 
traditional system inertia, the Digital Grid will need the development ]^[ installation of a new generation of Smart 
Transformers as an universal cyber-physical system interface, that can provide the needed system inertia ]^[ provide 
autonomous voltage, frequency ]^[ protection. It must also have the secured communication ]^[ software such as the 
Block-chain to participate in the real time energy market ]f[ resource sharing (a key attribute to the Digital Grid) by 
aggregating the DER, load ]^[ storage devices. New transmission technologies such as the High Voltage Direct 
Current (HVDC) must be further developed ]^[ installed to connect highly dynamic distribution grids with strong 
regional interconnection to balance of the system demand ]^[ supply. 
3. 
Availability of smart grid data is expected to increase precipitously. Compared to the traditional Supervisory Control 
]^[ Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems available ]f[ operations, these future data sources could provide vastly richer 
information about the state of the grid. Transforming this raw data into contextual information to support operations 
requires new data platforms ]^[ analytics capable of extracting useful information. This new information will enable 
utilities to: 1) create new control paradigms that operate the grid closer to system limits, lowering the cost of operation 
without sacrificing reliability; 2) improve asset utilization ]^[ management across transmission ]^[ distribution 
systems; ]^[ 3) integrate high levels of renewable generation. The unique characteristics of the new information 
available to operations create a number of challenges, including: extensive geo-spatial distribution, temporal diversity, 
internal organizational boundaries, disparate underlying physical sources ]^[ a wide range of data quality. Despite 
extensive investments in various IT technologies, utilities still lack sufficient infrastructure ]^[ understanding of the 
best approaches to manage this data. Major challenges ]f[ utilities today include data quality, data volume, data 
velocity, ]^[ especially data variety, although they clearly have issues to address in all these dimensions. 
4. 
Currently one of the biggest roadblocks ]f[ grid modernization is that the Information Technology (IT) infrastructure 
]f[ today's grid is rigid ]^[ low capacity. The push to adopt the existing open Internet ]^[ high-performance 
computing technologies would ]n[ be enough to meet the requirement of collecting ]^[ processing very large volumes 
of real-time data. Secondly, the impact of unreliable ]^[ insecure communication ]^[ computation infrastructures on 
grid operations is ]n[ well understood. Typically, the Internet cannot provide the required latency ]^[ packet loss 
performance ]f[ grid operation under high data-rates. Moreover, the network performance is highly random, ]^[ 
therefore, difficult to model accurately. Few studies have been conducted to leverage emerging IT technologies such 
as cloud computing, software defined networking (SDN), ]^[ network function virtualization (NFV), to accelerate this 
development. With the recent revolution in networking technology, these new communication mechanisms can open 
up more degrees of freedom in programmability ]^[ virtualization ]f[ tomorrow's grid. 
5. 
Cyber vulnerabilities of the power grid exist in numerous facilities, including Supervisory Control ]^[ Data 
Acquisition (SCADA) systems that power grids rely upon ]f[ monitoring ]^[ control of the physical grid. The 
increasing penetration of wind turbines, solar arrays, ]^[ energy storage devices creates potential new targets ]f[ 
cyber intrusions. About 65 million smart meters ]^[ other sensing devices, with capabilities ]f[ data collection ]f[ 
billing, outage reporting, ]^[ customers’ choice, have been installed at the customer locations. These low-cost devices

are targets ]f[ attackers, who may compromise large numbers of meters ]^[ use those meters to mount attacks. Such 
attacks resemble the October 2016 attack on the eastern U.S., in which smart devices such as wireless cameras were 
compromised ]^[ used to disrupt Internet access to millions of users. Ensuring resilience of the power grid to cyber 
threats will require a sustained ]^[ coordinated research effort towards understanding the vulnerabilities of cyber- 
attacks on the grid, providing defense mechanisms that can ameliorate the impact of attacks ]^[ ensure continued 
operation ]^[ efficient recovery from attacks when ]^[ where they occur. The cyber vulnerabilities of grid 
components must be characterized ]^[ mitigated. Privacy of sensitive power system data must also be preserved by 
efficient data protection ]^[ encryption techniques. 
Actions ]^[ Recommendations 
Based on the preceding discussion, we offer the following recommended actions: 
1. 
Create a multi-university based national consortium on digital grid to jointly study the critical cyber-physical 
challenges based on a competitive solicitation. 
Create a DOE led investment program to US industry ]^[ electric power companies to manufacture ]^[ 
upgrade the edge of the grid into a Digital Grid, such as the Smart Transformer manufacturing ]^[ 
deployment. 
Enhance funding ]f[ programs such as the NSF’s Cyber Physical System (CPS) program to focus on research 
needs associated with the Digital Grid. 
Develop realistic ]^[ comprehensive testbeds ]f[ evaluations of control ]^[ cyber- security that would be 
impractical to conduct on the power grid itself. 
Promote education ]^[ workforce development initiatives to train existing power engineers ]^[ grid 
operators about cyber-physical systems, data analytics, Internet-of-Things, cyber-security as well as educate 
the next generation of researchers ]^[ practitioners in the design ]^[ operation of secure ]^[ resilient power 
systems.
