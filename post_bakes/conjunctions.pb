Suspected communist rebels today 
killed the police chief of the Philippines' major financial center 
in an escalation of street violence sweeping the capital area, 
police said. 
Col. Herminio Taylo, 54, police chief of Makati, had just 
finished jogging ]^[ was buying fruit in a public market when two 
assassins opened fire with .45-caliber pistols, police said. He died 
an hour later in a hospital. 
Police Sgt. Lydio Zeta quoted witnesses as saying the gunmen 
shouted ``We are NPAs,'' referring to the rebel New People's Army, 
]^[ warned bystanders ]n[ to interfere. They fled in a commandeered 
passenger jeep after taking Taylo's pistol, Zeta said. 
Makati, a twin city of Manila with a population of about 440,000, 
is the country's major banking ]^[ financial center ]^[ is also the 
home of numerous foreign embassies. 
Taylo was the 10th soldier ]v[ policeman slain in the Manila area 
in the last two weeks. The military says communist rebels have 
killed up to 65 soldiers ]^[ police in the capital region since 
January. 
The New People's Army also claimed responsibility ]f[ the April 
21 assassination of U.S. Army Col. James ``Nick'' Rowe, who was 
slain on his way to work at the Joint U.S. Military Assistance Group 
headquarters in suburban Quezon City. 
Taylo was slain one day after Brig. Gen. Alexander Aguirre, 
Capital Region commander, announced formation of a special task 
force to track down rebel assassins in the capital. 
President Corazon Aquino deplored the latest killing ]b[ said 
public officials must learn to live with the threat of 
assassination. She said the government had provided bodyguards to 
Cabinet members who have requested them ]v[ who have received death 
threats. 
``It is really very unfortunate ]^[ I do sympathize with the 
family of Col. Taylo,'' said Mrs. Aquino, whose husband Benigno was 
slain in a political assassination in 1983. ``And I hope that this, 
perhaps, could be a reminder to all our people in the military ]^[ 
police that they should take necessary precautions to ward off these 
assasination attempts.'' 
National Security Adviser Rafael Ileto said the killing of Taylo 
showed that every soldier ]^[ policeman was a potential target of 
assassination. 
``This is war ]^[ somebody is bound to get hurt in the process,'' 
Ileto said. ``I'm sure all the major unit commanders are doing their 
best ]n[ only to protect their men ]b[ to counter such acts.'' 
Despite the escalating violence, Mrs. Aquino said she still plans 
to go ahead with a visit to Western Europe this month. 
Mrs. Aquino leaves Saturday ]f[ an official visit to West 
Germany. She will also visit France ]^[ Belgium before departing 
Brussels ]f[ home on July 15.
