RESPONSE PAPER 
The More You Do It, the Easier It Gets: 
Exposure ]^[ Response Prevention ]f[ OCD 
Michael B. Himle, University of North Dakota 
Martin E. Franklin, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine 
This manuscript is one in a series of invited papers to this journal. The purpose of the series is to highlight ]^[ discuss the similarities 
]^[ differences between various behavioral ]^[ cognitive-behavioral approaches to the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder 
(OCD). The first article in this series (Twohig & Whittal) describes the case of “Caroline” upon which the current manuscript is based. 
We approach the case from a cognitive-behavioral orientation with exposure ]^[ ritual prevention (EX/RP) as the primary therapeutic 
approach. We highlight the use of EX/RP because of the considerable body of empirical evidence showing that EX/RP is an efficacious 
treatment ]f[ both adult ]^[ pediatric OCD. Using the provided case vignette, we outline a rationale ]f[ EX/RP ]^[ describe how EX/ 
RP might be used to treat Caroline’s OCD. We begin by discussing the theoretical underpinnings ]f[ EX/RP ]^[ providing a rationale 
]f[ treatment. We then briefly discuss the rich extant literature supporting EX/RP as an effective treatment ]f[ OCD. We then provide a 
detailed case conceptualization ]^[ description of the treatment. We conclude with barriers commonly encountered during EX/RP. 
T 
has seen exciting advancements in 
psychosocial therapies ]f[ treating OCD. Arguably, 
though, the most thoroughly researched ]^[ most 
effective psychosocial treatment modality is cognitivebehavioral therapy (CBT) involving exposure ]^[ 
response prevention (EX/RP). EX/RP has consistently 
been shown to be effective ]f[ reducing symptoms of both 
adult ]^[ pediatric OCD. In fact, both the American 
Academy of Child ]^[ Adolescent Psychiatry (AACAP, 
1998) ]^[ the American Psychological Association (Task 
Force on Promotion ]^[ Dissemination of Psychological 
Procedures, 1995) have concluded that CBT has garnered 
enough research support to be considered the treatment 
of choice ]f[ both children ]^[ adults with OCD. 
Although there are a host of specific techniques ]^[ 
delivery strategies subsumed under the CBT umbrella, 
one of the primary goals of CBT is to teach the patient the 
skills needed to directly confront fear-evoking stimuli 
without engaging in fear-neutralizing rituals. If this can be 
accomplished both persistently (for a sufficient duration 
of time per trial) ]^[ consistently (across trials), the 
patient is likely to experience a natural reduction in 
anxiety and, more importantly, will eventually be able to 
go about his/her day-to-day activities without the need ]f[ 
elaborate rituals ]v[ avoidance repertoires. 
Introduction to EX/RP ]f[ OCD 
HE PAST DECADE 
We would like to begin by stating that EX/RP, as we use 
it here, does ]n[ refer to a theoretical stance, ]b[ rather 
refers to a collection of treatment techniques that were 
borne from behavioral theory. As the name implies, EX/ 
RP is a collection of therapeutic techniques aimed at 
teaching an individual to approach, rather than avoid, 
fear-producing stimuli (exposure) coupled with the prevention of fear-neutralizing rituals (response prevention). 
That being said, it would be misleading to suggest that we 
do ]n[ frequently employ other treatment techniques, 
such as those commonly used in treatment packages that 
emphasize more cognitively-based techniques (see Chosak, Marques, Fama, Renaud, Wilhelm, 2009). Together, 
this collection of techniques is frequently referred to as 
CBT. We do ]n[ consider the more cognitive techniques 
included in these packages to be inconsistent with 
behavioral theory nor with EX/RP.1 We view them as 
ancillary techniques that can be used within a treatment 
package to accomplish the treatment goal of providing 
opportunities ]f[ an OCD patient to experience fear, 
observe fear reduction even in the absence of ritualistic 
efforts to avoid ]v[ prevent feared consequences, ]^[ to

We conceptualize cognition as an active, albeit private, behavioral 
process, perhaps better termed “thinking,” which is consistent with a 
behavioral analysis. However, ]f[ simplicity we will refer to “thinking” 
as “cognitive” ]^[ when referring to intervention techniques we will 
use the traditional term “cognitive therapy.”

learn from repeated experience that the feared consequences do ]n[ materialize ]^[ that obsessional distress 
reduces over the course of time if allowed to do so. 
It is also important to note from the outset that the 
cause of OCD remains unknown ]^[ no single model 
]v[ theory ]y[ proposed, including behavioral theory, is 
able to fully explain how ]v[ why OCD develops (Taylor, 
Abramowitz, & McKay, 2007). Further, there are no 
data to support any single theory in accounting ]f[ the 
wide symptom variability observed in OCD patients. In 
fact, one can be reasonably certain that the underlying 
cause of OCD is multifactorial; involving complex 
interactions between genetic, physiological, ]^[ behavioral (including cognitive, emotional, ]^[ social) 
factors. Just as psychopharmacological interventions 
have spawned from our understanding of the underlying biological processes involved in OCD, CBT has 
risen from our understanding of underlying behavioral 
processes involved in OCD. 
Theoretical Rationale ]f[ EX/RP 
Early learning models of OCD were based largely on a 
two-factor theory of fear (Dollard & Miller, 1950; Mowrer, 
1951, 1960). The two-factor model proposes that when an 
individual is faced with a situation that elicits a physiological fear ]v[ anxiety state, an unconditioned (i.e., 
unlearned) behavioral reaction to escape that state is 
initiated. If the action is successful in reducing the anxiety, 
it is strengthened, through negative reinforcement, ]^[ 
thus is more likely to be reproduced in the presence of 
similar anxiety-producing stimuli in the future. Through 
learning experiences, various internal (e.g., thoughts ]^[ 
images) ]^[ external (i.e., contextual) stimuli acquire the 
ability to elicit anxiety ]^[ the ensuing escape response. 
When the escape response is performed “compulsively” in 
response to benign (albeit distress-evoking) stimuli, one is 
said to suffer from OCD. 
EX/RP is based on the assumption that if an individual 
is systematically exposed to stimuli that elicit obsessional 
thoughts ]^[ associated anxiety, ]^[ is prevented from 
escaping ]v[ otherwise neutralizing the anxiety (ritual 
prevention), the anxiety will diminish over time through 
the process of extinction ]^[ the person will be better 
able to function in his/her daily life. Theorists such as Foa 
]^[ Kozak (1986) have posited that habituation is aided 
by exposure to corrective information in that the 
individual learns, through direct experience, that the 
feared consequences do ]n[ materialize in the situations 
that typically evoke obsessional distress. With repetition, 
the reduction of anxiety in the previously feared situation 
makes it easier in the long run to resist the weaker urges to 
escape and/or ritualize. 
From a practical standpoint, a behavioral conceptualization focuses on the here-and-now functional relation- 
ship between an individual’s obsessions ]^[ compulsions, 
with the assumption that this relationship can be modified 
in treatment without necessarily understanding the 
“cause” of the obsessions. Furthermore, the specific 
content ]v[ form of the obsessions ]^[ compulsions is 
relatively unimportant except to the extent that they set 
the context ]f[ preparing specific treatment exercises. For 
example, a person who reports distress related to 
repetitive, intrusive thoughts of harming their spouse 
might engage in one ]v[ more forms of compulsive 
behavior to reduce this distress. Examples might include 
frequent “checking in,” taking measures to avoid situations perceived as “high risk,” ]v[ elaborate mental rituals. 
In each of these examples, the common underlying theme 
is the repetitive performance of one ]v[ more rituals that 
functions to remove ]v[ avoid the distress associated with 
obsessional thoughts. In each case, the individual can 
learn to manage his/her OCD using EX/RP without 
necessarily knowing how the obsession developed. In fact, 
throughout the course of EX/RP, analyzing the nature 
]^[ cause of one’s obsessions is actively discouraged as this 
often leads the person to “fight” with the obsessions, which 
is likely to ultimately make them worse. 
Empirical Support ]f[ EX/RP ]f[ OCD 
A review of the research literature shows strong 
support ]f[ EX/RP as a treatment ]f[ OCD. Several 
recent qualitative ]^[ quantitative (i.e., meta-analytic) 
literature reviews have evaluated ]^[ critiqued the CBT 
]f[ OCD literature ]^[ each has concluded that CBT is 
an effective treatment ]f[ reducing OCD in adults ]^[ 
children (Abramowitz, 1996, 1997; Abramowitz, Franklin, 
& Foa, 2002; Abramowitz, Whiteside, & Deacon, 2005; 
Foa & Kozak, 1996). Overall, based on these reviews of 
the literature, reasonable estimates show EX/RP to be an 
effective treatment ]f[ 60% to 90% of individuals with 
50% to 80% symptom reduction common (Abramowitz, 
1996, 1997; Abramowitz et al., 2002; Abramowitz et al., 
2005; Foa & Kozak, 1996; Greist, 2000). Furthermore, 
recent evidence suggests that treatment gains are 
maintained at 2-year follow-up (Whittal, Robichaud, 
Thordarson, & McLean, in press). The treatment improvement rates observed in EX/RP rival those of 
pharmacological studies, ]^[ head-to-head behavior 
therapy versus pharmacological treatment studies suggest 
that behavior therapy ]n[ only provides longer-lasting 
gains ]b[ also results in greater short-term improvement 
in symptoms (e.g., Foa et al., 2005; Greist, 1996; Simpson 
et al., 2004). 
Case Conceptualization 
The case of Caroline (Twohig & Whittal, 2009-this 
issue) provides a nice constellation of OC symptoms that 
Response: EX/RP ]f[ OCD 
will allow us to outline how OCD would be conceptualized 
within a cognitive-behavioral framework ]^[ treated 
using EX/RP. Before we describe how EX/RP might 
proceed, it will be helpful ]f[ the reader to first review 
Caroline’s primary OC symptoms, which are described 
below ]^[ are summarized in Table 1. 
Caroline’s primary obsessional theme centers around 
fears that she will cause harm to those around her by 
spreading “bad energy” ]v[ illness which will result in injury, 
illness, harm ]v[ death befalling friends, family members, 
children, ]v[ other individuals in her immediate proximity. 
Caroline’s description of her obsessions is elaborate. She 
describes accompanying feelings of “dust” on her hands 
]^[ mouth, which she believes serves as a medium by 
which “bad energy” is spread from herself to others. 
When her obsessional thoughts are evoked, Caroline 
performs several compulsive rituals, which she believes 
will prevent harm from coming to others. Early in the 
course of her disorder, she would flick her fingers in order 
to remove the harmful dust, ]b[ she now fears that this 
might spread the dust to those around her. As a result, her 
compulsive rituals have evolved to include: (a) closing her 
hands into fists whenever she gets the dusty feeling, (b) 
biting the sides of her tongue to “dissolve” the dust ]s[ it 
does ]n[ spread, (c) praying ]f[ God to protect those 
around her, (d) repeating the phrase “just goodness,” 
which she believes will protect those around her, (e) 
avoiding saying “goodbye” out of fear that doing ]s[ will 
cause harm to the recipient of the gesture, (f) wiping her 
hands before visiting someone who is ill, ]^[ (g) 
31 
performing elaborate rituals to remove contaminants 
after visiting someone who is ill (wiping/washing her 
hands, washing her clothing, ]^[ showering). She also 
engages her husband in her rituals by asking him to wash 
his hands ]^[ clothing after visiting someone who is ill in 
order to prevent him from becoming ill. These by-proxy 
rituals, often referred to as accommodation, are ]n[ 
uncommon, especially within close interpersonal (e.g., 
spousal, partner ]^[ parent-child) relationships. 
In addition to her fears of directly causing harm to 
others, Caroline reports a pathological sense of responsibility to prevent harm from coming to others ]^[ fears 
that if she does ]n[ perform specific rituals, those around 
her will contract cancer ]v[ will be otherwise harmed. To 
alleviate the anxiety associated with these obsessions, she 
engages in a variety of covert ]^[ overt “protective” 
rituals, which temporarily alleviate her discomfort. Her 
covert ritual involves creating an imagined circle around 
the person whom she believes she needs to protect ]^[ 
mentally “pulling” the imagined circle away from the 
person. In addition, she engages in a variety of overt 
rituals, including touching the person, praying, ]^[ eyeblinking. According to Caroline, these rituals protect the 
person from harm. It is also noteworthy that Caroline also 
engages in mental checking rituals. She states that when 
she hears of an accident (perhaps on the news), she 
“mentally reviews” whether she came into contact with the 
person involved in the accident. This type of questioning/ 
checking would be considered a mental ritual designed to 
alleviate distress associated with her pathological sense of

responsibility. The function of mental rituals is the same 
as more overt rituals, ]^[ hence they too play a key role in 
the maintenance of OCD ]^[ must be directly targeted 
via response prevention. 
Given her pattern of symptoms, ]^[ the generally 
robust response of OCD symptoms to EX/RP, Caroline 
would be a good candidate ]f[ this treatment. The goal of 
EX/RP would be to teach Caroline to confront feared 
situations, in a graduated manner, while simultaneously 
]^[ voluntarily refraining from performing her rituals. 
Although the “meat” of treatment would focus on 
exposure ]^[ ritual prevention, maladaptive OCD-specific cognitions would be identified ]^[ cognitive therapy 
(CT) techniques could be also included to target these 
symptoms, as there is some research to show that cognitive 
techniques can be helpful. It has been suggested that 
cognitive techniques might increase compliance with 
exposure tasks ]f[ some patients (Freeston, Ladouceur, 
Gagnon, et al., 1997, Leahy, 2007) ]^[ compliance with 
treatment has been associated with improved treatment 
outcome (Abramowitz, Franklin, Zoellner, & DiBernardo, 
2002). It has also been suggested that cognitive techniques might improve treatment retention (Vogel, Stiles, & 
Gotestam, 2004); however; empirical findings on this 
matter are mixed, with some clinical trials failing to 
demonstrate differential dropout rates between EX/RP 
with ]^[ without CT (Whittal, Thordarson, & McLean, 
2005) ]^[ some recent research showing EX/RP to be 
associated with higher dropout rates than CT (Whittal et 
al., in press). It is important to note that when cognitive 
techniques are adopted ]^[ utilized in conjunction with 
EX/RP, the inclusion of cognitive therapy techniques is 
]n[ meant to change, suppress, ]v[ stop the patient’s 
irrational obsessions in the moment. To the contrary, the 
focus of treatment is to teach Caroline to directly confront 
the feared stimulus ]^[ deliberately elaborate ]v[ focus 
upon the fears in the moment, rather than to engage in 
attempts to stop obsessions ]^[ discomfort from occurring. Most often, patients with OCD have worked very 
hard at inherently futile attempts to stop their obsessions. 
Unfortunately, rather than decreasing distress, such 
attempts contribute to the problem ]^[ make OCD 
worse. For example, when working with Caroline, we 
might use cognitive techniques to teach her to evaluate 
]^[ more accurately estimate the actual level of threat 
]^[ probability of the negative outcomes that she fears. 
We may also teach her that thoughts are often inaccurate 
]^[ that she does ]n[ necessarily have to listen to her 
thoughts ]v[ take them literally. Rather, we would suggest 
that her thoughts ]^[ fears are hypotheses that can be 
directly tested during EX/RP. In addition to increasing 
compliance with EX/RP, this technique is designed to 
“externalize” OCD ]^[ to encourage Caroline to stop 
“fighting” with her OCD ]^[ start “being her own boss.” 
This places emphasis on trying to change her behavior 
rather than trying to change her thoughts. 
In order to help Caroline to conceptualize her 
obsessions ]^[ rituals from an EX/RP standpoint, we 
would first help her to understand that her rituals are 
performed to alleviate the discomfort that is associated 
with the obsessional thoughts ]v[ images. It is often the case 
that individuals with OCD fail to understand that although 
their rituals are effective ]f[ reducing discomfort in the 
short term, they are maintaining (or even worsening) 
OCD in the long-term. To help Caroline understand how 
this relates to EX/RP, we would help her to understand 
that the only way ]f[ her to overcome her fears is to refrain 
from ritualizing ]^[ directly experience the outcome. 
Although rarely stated explicitly in our rational, these 
direct experiences will help her to experience that harm 
does ]n[ actually occur ]^[ that although refraining from 
ritualizing is uncomfortable (at least in the short term) it is 
]n[ dangerous to herself ]v[ others. 
During EX/RP, emphasis is always placed on the fact 
that patients with OCD can exercise voluntary control 
over their rituals ]b[ cannot, nor should not, attempt to 
control their obsessions ]v[ the associated distress in the 
moment. In fact, Abramowitz (2006) suggested that two 
“commandments” of successful EX/RP are that patients 
should (a) expect to feel uncomfortable ]^[ (b) should 
]n[ try to fight the discomfort. 
Implementation of EX/RP 
The number ]^[ length of EX/RP sessions that an 
individual will need will vary considerably, depending 
upon the severity of the individual’s OCD symptoms, the 
person’s availability ]f[ treatment, ]^[ a host of other 
factors. Our experience (which is consistent with data 
reported from randomized controlled trials) is that most 
individuals seeking treatment on an outpatient basis will 
respond well to 12 to 15 treatment sessions, conducted at 
least weekly, ]^[ each lasting 60 to 90 minutes. There are 
now several manuals that provide step-by-step ]^[ sessionby-session guides to implementing EX/RP (e.g., Abramowitz, 2006; Franklin & Foa, 1998; Kozak & Foa, 1997; Riggs 
& Foa, 1993; Steketee, 1993). Although each manual 
suggests slight variations in treatment, the general session 
structure is fairly consistent. The primary components of 
EX/RP include assessment of OCD symptoms, psychoeducation ]^[ treatment rationale, symptom monitoring, 
developing fear hierarchies, in-session ]^[ out-of-session 
exposure work, relapse prevention, ]^[ generalization 
training. A sample session structure is provided in Table 2.

assessed using the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale 
(Y-BOCS), which is the gold-standard instrument ]f[ 
assessing OCD symptoms in adults. The Y-BOCS has been 
shown to be sensitive ]f[ detecting treatment-related 
change ]s[ it can be administered repeatedly over the 
course of treatment to assess treatment gains. It is noteworthy, however, that in addition to the Y-BOCS, several 
other structured interviews ]^[ self-report instruments 
possess favorable psychometric properties ]^[ can be 
included to aid in the assessment of OCD symptoms. 
Commonly used structured interviews include the Structured Clinical Interview ]f[ the DSM (SCID; First et al., 
1995) ]^[ the Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule (ADIS; 
DiNardo, Brown, & Barlow, 1994). Commonly used selfreport measures include the National Institute of Mental 
Health Global Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (NIMH-GOCS; 
Insel et al., 1983), the Padua Inventory (Sanavio, 1988), the 
Leyton Obsessional Inventory (LOI; Cooper, 1970), ]^[ the 
Obsessive Compulsive Inventory (OCI; Foa, Kozak, Salkovskis, Coles, & Amir, 1998). Each of these self-report measures 
show adequate psychometric properties ]^[ are relatively 
brief to complete (see St. Clare, 2003, ]f[ a review). 
On the Y-BOCS, Caroline received a total sore of 22, 
suggesting that her symptoms were of moderate severity. 
As noted above ]^[ convergent with the great majority of 
individuals with clinical OCD (e.g., Foa & Kozak, 1995), 
Caroline reports both obsessions ]^[ compulsions that 
affect her life in several ways: She spends considerable 
time engaged in rituals, avoids children ]^[ individuals 
who are ill, avoids some (albeit few) situations ]^[ 
touching of items, ]^[ reports that daily activities require 
considerable effort. In addition, she directly involves her 
husband in her rituals, which may strain their relationship. 
Psychoeducation 
Psychoeducation will be provided during the first few 
sessions of treatment ]^[ periodically throughout treatment as necessary. Psychoeducation has several goals, 
which are summarized in Table 2. In addition to providing 
basic information about the disorder, it is also important to 
provide a working model of OCD that focuses on the hereand-now functional relationship between obsessions ]^[ 
rituals. By focusing on the present ]^[ future (rather than 
the past), the therapist can help the patient understand 
33 
34 
Himle & Franklin 
the need for, ]^[ function of, EX/RP ]^[ can also help 
the patient understand that treatment can progress without necessarily knowing ]v[ understanding what “caused” 
the disorder in the first place. For example, it is often the 
case that patients will ask, “Why do I have OCD?” It is ]n[ 
uncommon ]f[ patients such as Caroline to have reviewed 
]^[ searched events throughout their history ]f[ some 
clue ]v[ answer to this question, often with the hope that by 
discovering what caused the OCD they will be able to 
somehow fix the problem. For example, Caroline reports a 
series of unfortunate events that she might believe caused 
her OCD (e.g., strained relationship with her mother ]f[ 
which she felt a sense of responsibility, physical illness, 
several unexplained miscarriages, a friend who died from 
an illness ]f[ which Caroline blamed herself). These are 
certainly unfortunate life events, ]b[ these events did ]n[ 
cause Caroline’s OCD, nor did Caroline cause these events 
to occur. When patients are focused on the cause of their 
OCD, we find it helpful to explain that OCD is a 
neurobehavioral disorder whose causes are ]n[ ]y[ fully 
understood. Focusing on biological factors helps the 
patient understand that OCD is a medical illness rather 
than a “learned habit” that the patient can control with 
sufficient effort. For some patients, it is helpful to actually 
describe the neurobiological ]^[ neurochemical underpinnings believed to be involved in OCD. We then explain 
to the patient that there is evidence that if the patient 
learns EX/RP ]^[ changes their behavior, it is possible to 
directly affect the underlying neurobiological disruption. 
In addition to providing essential information about 
OCD, psychoeducation often helps reduce any self-blame 
the patient may have ]^[ promotes the externalizing of 
OCD ]s[ that the patient can align with the therapist to 
learn new ways to manage his/her OCD (i.e., engage in 
EX/RP). Often, patients such as Caroline will make 
statements such as, “I am, deep down, a horrible person.” 
Such statements are indicative of the level of self-blame 
]^[ self-criticism some clients exhibit ]^[ highlight the 
importance of good psychoeducation. In this case we 
might begin by stating, “As I mentioned earlier, OCD is a 
medical disorder that often makes people feel pretty 
horrible. As you mentioned earlier, OCD has taken over 
your life in many ways ]^[ you have spent considerable 
time ]^[ effort fighting with your OCD at the expense of 
doing other things you would like to do. Unfortunately, 
this fighting hasn’t seemed to work. Perhaps it is time to try 
something new.” In addition, this is a good opportunity to 
introduce the concept of “externalizing” OCD. We might 
say to Caroline, “It sounds like OCD is telling you that you 
are a bad person, ]b[ one thing about OCD is that it 
doesn’t always tell the truth. Perhaps OCD is telling you 
things that are ]n[ true. Does that seem possible?” We may 
also ask Caroline, “What makes a person good ]v[ bad?” 
Depending upon her response, we might then help her 
realize that OCD has prevented her from living her life the 
way she would like to, which has made her feel horrible, ]b[ 
that feeling horrible does ]n[ necessarily make her a 
horrible person. We can then propose that through EX/ 
RP, Caroline can learn skills that will help her to function 
on a day-to-day basis. For example, if she learns to change 
her behavior ]s[ that she can pursue more enjoyable 
activities, she may feel better ]^[ less like a horrible 
person. Externalizing OCD is a therapeutic technique that 
should be used throughout treatment. It is designed to 
distance the patient’s thoughts from his/her behavior ]^[ 
to align the patient ]^[ therapist as a “team” that is 
working toward changing the patient’s behavior. 
Providing a Cogent Rationale ]f[ EX/RP 
From the perspective of EX/RP, further attempts to 
discover the cause of OCD beyond those presented in 
psychoeducation are ]n[ likely to enhance treatment. The 
primary goal of EX/RP is to help the person understand 
how their rituals are currently maintained, ]n[ how they 
came to be in the first place. Specifically, emphasis is 
placed on helping the person to understand that obsessions give rise to distress, compulsions reduce distress, ]^[ 
any behavior designed to reduce this distress will be 
strengthened ]^[ repeated. This focus on the present 
helps set the stage ]f[ EX/RP by providing a rationale ]f[ 
response prevention. Simply put, the rationale is that 
rituals (i.e., avoidance) are the problem because they 
“feed” the obsessions, which in turn elicit anxiety ]^[ 
discomfort. It is critically important, however, to convey to 
the patient that the reduction in the frequency ]^[ 
intensity of obsessional distress is a process that will occur 
over time with repeated exposure, ]^[ that in fact the 
short-term goal of the treatment is to increase this distress 
by intentionally confronting the very situations ]^[ 
thoughts that will provoke it. Put another way, we emphasize the importance of increasing distress ]^[ discomfort 
(focus on the present), with the knowledge that empirical 
studies have indicated that, over time, the patient’s 
anxiety ]^[ distress will decrease. 
Focusing on the functional relationship between obsessions ]^[ compulsions also underscores the importance of 
making efforts to limit rituals ]^[ other avoidance 
behaviors rather than trying to derail ]v[ change obsessions. 
This emphasis is essential to convey because many 
individuals with OCD are highly motivated to “fight” to 
control their obsessions. Ironically, however, fighting with 
obsessions is likely to do more harm than good, as there is 
considerable evidence to show that attempting to control 
obsessions is likely to increase their frequency ]^[ intensity 
(Clark, Ball, & Pape, 1991). This concept is introduced 
early in treatment in order to help the patient understand 
that trying to fight obsessions is much like “shoveling sand.” 
The strong emphasis on ritual prevention helps highlight 
Response: EX/RP ]f[ OCD 
the message that while the patient can exert some control 
over the performance of rituals, he/she cannot control 
(i.e., “stop”) the thoughts ]v[ associated distress. 
The rationale ]f[ ritual prevention should be broached 
carefully, as even the thought of refraining from 
performing rituals can elicit considerable anxiety, especially early in treatment. We often find it helpful to begin 
with examples unrelated to OCD. For example, we might 
ask Caroline, “Were you nervous the first time you went 
on a date with your husband?” If she answers “yes,” then 
we can use this as a nonthreatening way to introduce the 
principles of EX/RP. For example, we might present the 
following: “It is normal to feel anxious during a first date, 
but, had you avoided dating because of your first date 
anxiety, what do you think would have been the outcome?” The goal is to help Caroline understand that if she 
had avoided her first date with her husband, she may ]n[ 
have developed a relationship with him, regardless of how 
much she desired one. In addition, we might ask Caroline 
“How nervous were you on the second date, third date, 
etc.?” ]v[ “How nervous are you to go on a date with your 
husband now?” ]^[ “Are you glad that you went on that 
first date?” The goal here is to use a non-threatening 
example to help Caroline understand that the more dates 
she attended with her husband, the easier it became. The 
possibility that a similar process might be applicable to 
OCD is introduced as a hypothesis to be tested through 
EX/RP. In other words, the goal is to help Caroline 
understand ]^[ accept that if she works with the therapist 
to learn a specific set of OCD management skills in which 
she is able to gradually reduce her ritualistic behavior, she 
will be better able to function on a day-to-day basis despite 
having OCD. By doing ]s[ across the board, interestingly 
enough ]^[ as the treatment outcome data in OCD 
repeatedly support, the frequency ]^[ intensity of the 
obsessions are likely to diminish with time. Thus, by 
paying less attention to obsessions in the short run, the 
therapist can make the empirically supported statement 
that their pernicious influence as well as their frequency 
will likely be reduced. 
It is often the case that even after an individual gains an 
understanding of the principles behind EX/RP, they 
remain understandably hesitant to fully engage in the 
treatment because they quickly understand that they will be 
asked to tolerate discomfort (we often refer to this as the 
“You want me to do what?” phenomenon). The therapist 
might address this by helping Caroline understand that she 
is already tolerating great levels of discomfort, ]b[ toward 
no useful end. This is also when the therapist introduces 
the concept of extinction, which, simply put, can be 
summarized as “maybe you have to let yourself feel bad to 
feel good” ]^[ posed as a hypothesis that perhaps “the 
more you do it, the easier it gets.” Although the immediate 
focus of therapy is reducing rituals, patients with a sufficient 
understanding of the EX/RP model quickly come to 
realize that by refraining from rituals, they are likely to 
experience a significant reduction in anxiety in the long 
run because they are no longer performing the escape/ 
avoidance rituals ]^[ are thereby allowing extinction to 
occur. They are no longer “feeding the beast,” as it were. 
The Nuts ]^[ Bolts of EX/RP 
After the client is on board with EX/RP, it is important 
to gather information about anxiety “triggers” ]^[ to help 
the client recognize their rituals, which is often difficult 
because some patients’ rituals have become ]s[ habitual 
that they may be unaware of their performance. Helping a 
patient to recognize triggers ]^[ rituals is accomplished 
through a combination of clinician interview ]^[ selfmonitoring. Self-monitoring forms can be easily developed to help patients record ]^[ recognize, in real-time, 
instances of ritualizing. When completing a self-monitoring form, it is important to ]n[ just record the time, 
frequency, ]^[ duration of rituals, ]b[ also to record 
contextual factors ]^[ information about obsessions (i.e., 
feared consequences) ]s[ that OC triggers can be 
identified. For example, triggers ]f[ Caroline might be 
leaving in the morning (having to say “goodbye” to her 
husband), crowded places where she might spread her 
“dust” to others, the sight of children, ]^[ social 
encounters that might require a hand-shake greeting. 
Early in treatment, it is also helpful to teach patients a 
method ]f[ quantifying anxiety. This is typically accomplished using a Subjective Units of Distress Scale (SUDS). 
SUDS refers to a metric in which the client rates her 
anxiety on a 0-to-100 scale, with 0 indicating no distress 
]^[ 100 indicating to maximum distress. The SUDS scale 
can be used to determine the level of anxiety triggered by 
various obsessions/triggers ]^[ will be essential ]f[ 
building a fear hierarchy. It also allows a very succinct 
way to convey the level of distress being experienced in a 
given exposure. The therapist can use this technique to 
begin constructing a hierarchy of feared situations that 
will be used during EX/RP. Sample hierarchies2 ]f[ two of 
Caroline’s primary fears ]^[ associated SUDS ratings are 
presented in Tables 3 ]^[ 4. 
2 
Note that these hierarchies are presented in a somewhat 
simplified manner. Hierarchies are highly individualized to the 
patient ]^[ the individual’s unique presentation of OC symptoms. 
In addition, hierarchies can include from a few to several dozen items 
]^[ a single client may have multiple hierarchies ]f[ various 
obsessional fears. For Caroline, multiple hierarchies might be 
constructed to address each of her obsessions ]^[ associated rituals. 
We often tell clients that hierarchies are a bit like the Hawaiian 
Islands; there is a big island ]^[ several smaller islands, ]b[ we deal 
with them all the same way: low, medium, high, move on . . . low, 
medium, high, move on. In addition, hierarchies will likely be 
modified ]^[ expanded over the course of treatment. 
35 
Himle & Franklin 
36 
After a sufficient hierarchy is developed (typically by 
Session 3), patients are ready to begin exposure exercises. 
Exposures begin with moderately easy items (typically 
SUDS ratings of 30 ]v[ less) ]^[ gradually work their way 
up the hierarchy to more difficult items. Exposure tasks 
are conducted in session (with the therapist) ]b[ the bulk 
of the exposure work is assigned as between-session 
homework, which the patient completes without assistance from the therapist. The combination of therapist 
]^[ self-performed exposures is important as there is 
some evidence to suggest that patients who receive 
therapist-assisted exposures demonstrate greater symptom reduction than patients who perform only self-guided 
exposure exercises (Abramowitz, 1996). On the flip side, 
it is ]n[ practical ]f[ the patient to conduct all of their 
exposure work in session ]^[ learning to conduct selfexposures promotes treatment generalization. 
Each exposure should be repeated several times until 
the patient is able to complete the exposure task with 
minimal effort ]^[ with complete ritual prevention. For 
example, in order to monitor the effectiveness of 
exposure exercises, Caroline will be asked to complete 
an exposure record in which she records her anxiety 
before, during, ]^[ after each exposure ]^[ she should 
]n[ move from the first hierarchy item (e.g., shaking her 
husband’s hand) to the second item (e.g., shaking a 
family member’s hand) until she is able to complete the 
first item with minimal effort ]^[ without praying ]v[ 
“vacuuming” her “bad dust.” As a general rule, the most 
important aspects of successful exposure are to (a) 
conduct exposure exercises that are manageable, (b)

refrain from all ritualistic behavior during the exposure, 
(c) continue the exposure until it can be performed with 
relative ease both inside ]^[ outside of therapy sessions, 
(d) conduct the exposure repeatedly. 
As treatment progresses, it is important to repeatedly 
monitor ]^[ assess a patient’s OC symptoms ]^[ add 
items to the hierarchy as necessary. However, the goal ]f[ 
treatment is ]n[ only to help the patient work through 
their hierarchy, ]b[ also to teach the patient to monitor 
OC symptoms, create new hierarchy exercises, ]^[ to 
conduct exposure exercises ]f[ new hierarchy items. In 
other words, the goal is to teach the patient a set of skills to 
help them manage their anxiety ]v[ “be their own 
therapist.” For example, after mastering several items on 
her hierarchy, Caroline may disclose that “I am finding 
that I am vacuuming more than I used to when I am 
around children.” Such a realization would be a good 
opportunity ]f[ the therapist to assess Caroline’s mastery 
of EX/RP by having her develop her own exposure 
hierarchy to address this ritual (e.g., visit a familiar child, 
shake a child’s hand, babysit a friend’s child, visit a child 
care center, etc.). We often tell our clients that the 
ultimate goal of treatment is to make the patient an OCD 
]^[ EX/RP expert, thereby making the therapist no 
longer necessary. 
Response: EX/RP ]f[ OCD 
The last few sessions of treatment will focus on working 
through the most difficult items on the hierarchy ]^[ 
relapse prevention. If feasible, we prefer to have a patient 
work through the most difficult items on their hierarchy 
before treatment is terminated, ]b[ unfortunately this is 
]n[ always feasible. However, if treatment has been 
successful, Caroline has learned to identify ]^[ monitor 
her OC symptoms ]^[ how to plan ]^[ build exposure 
exercises to address them. During the last few sessions, the 
therapist should work with Caroline to identify, ]^[ 
prepare for, future challenges ]^[ problem solve how to 
address them. This may include follow-up sessions and/or 
telephone calls with the therapist, recruiting family 
members to provide support, and/or reviewing treatment 
information. 
Possible Difficulties ]^[ Barriers to 
Caroline’s Treatment 
Perhaps the most common barriers to treatment are 
noncompliance with exposure exercises ]^[ difficulties 
achieving successful response prevention. In the former 
case, it is important to work with the client to attempt to 
determine factors affecting treatment compliance. Common reasons include lack of motivation, misunderstanding/ 
disagreement with the behavioral model, interpersonal 
factors ]v[ poor therapist-client match, moving too rapidly 
up the stimulus hierarchy, ]^[ comorbid ]v[ co-occurring 
psychological issues such as depression ]v[ social anxiety 
that may be more pressing ]^[ need to be addressed first. 
When a client understands the model ]^[ seems motivated 
]f[ treatment ]y[ is having difficulty with exposures ]v[ 
response prevention, it is important ]f[ the therapist to 
consider whether treatment is appropriately tailored ]f[ 
the particular client. For example, is the hierarchy 
appropriately constructed? Are the exposures relevant? 
Are the exposures too difficult? Treatment noncompliance 
should be addressed early in treatment ]^[ should be an 
iterative problem-solving process between the therapist 
]^[ client. 
Another common barrier to treatment is unintentional 
subtle avoidance, which often takes the form of substituting one obvious ritual ]f[ a less noticeable ritual that 
serves the same anxiety-reducing function. In most cases, 
patients are unaware that they are engaging in subtle 
avoidance. For example, a person with hand-washing 
rituals associated with contamination fears might learn to 
refrain from washing his/her hands, ]b[ might (either 
unwittingly ]v[ purposefully) wipe his/her hands on 
another surface to remove contamination. Another 
example of subtle avoidance is reassurance seeking. 
Caroline might have mastered several items on her 
hierarchy—for example, she may be able to attend a 
public event without praying, ]b[ she may ask the 
therapist, “I feel like I cause misery ]^[ death wherever 
I go; do you think I am causing harm to people around 
me?” In this case, Caroline may be seeking reassurance 
from the therapist to confirm that she is in fact ]n[ causing 
harm. The therapist must be careful in how he/she 
answers reassurance-seeking questions. If the therapist 
answers, “No, I don’t think you are causing harm to 
people around you,” the therapist can very easily 
reinforce OCD by reducing Caroline’s anxiety (albeit 
incidentally). In fact, reassurance seeking is a common 
ritual in OCD than can be easily overlooked by both the 
therapist ]^[ the client. We might respond to such 
reassurance-seeking questions by stating, “Who is asking, 
you ]v[ OCD? It sounds to me that perhaps OCD is trying 
the back door technique. Do you think it is possible that 
OCD is telling you that you are causing harm because you 
are no longer ritualizing? Based on your experiences in 
therapy thus far, how would you answer OCD?” By turning 
the question back on the patient, the therapist can help 
the patient recognize subtle avoidance. In doing so, 
however, a patient might think that they have suffered a 
treatment setback because they did ]n[ recognize this 
subtle form of ritualizing. When this occurs, the therapist 
might state, “These forms of subtle avoidance need to be 
carefully attended to ]b[ can be viewed as treatment 
progress. It sounds like OCD’s old tricks (i.e., old rituals) 
are no longer working ]s[ OCD is trying to trick you into 
other ways of ritualizing.” We would then send the patient 
home to carefully monitor ]f[ any other subtle “tricks” 
that OCD may be attempting to pull. 
Yet another factor that may complicate treatment arises 
when a patient’s family members have become involved in 
rituals. This is especially common ]f[ children (who 
involve their parents) ]^[ individuals within intimate 
relationships (e.g., spouse). There is some evidence that 
Caroline has involved her husband in her rituals. 
Specifically, she asks him to wash his hands ]^[ clothing 
in order to prevent him from becoming ill. It would be 
beneficial to include Caroline’s husband in treatment ]f[ 
two reasons. First, exposure exercises might include him 
directly. For example, an exposure exercise might involve 
having him visit someone ill ]v[ go to the hospital ]^[ 
come home ]b[ ]n[ wash his clothes. Second, he can serve 
as a model ]^[ support person ]f[ Caroline by helping 
her identify subtle rituals, provide encouragement, help 
her problem solve difficult situations, ]^[ model “normal” behavior in situations in which Caroline has a history 
of ritualizing. Ideally, Caroline’s husband would be 
involved in all aspects of treatment; however, at a 
minimum it would be helpful if he understood the 
treatment model, the rationale ]f[ treatment, ]^[ was 
willing to participate in specific exposure exercises. 
A final factor that might complicate treatment is the 
presence of a comorbid psychological disorder. In addition to OCD, Caroline suffers from other sources of 
37 
Himle & Franklin 
38 
anxiety, many of which are related to social situations. 
Specifically, she reports having difficulty attending parties, 
public speaking, writing in public, eating in public, using 
public restrooms, being assertive, ]^[ initiating/maintaining a conversation, ]^[ fear of embarrassment. She 
also reports feeling “inferior.” Also consistent with 
anxiety, she engages in a variety of avoidance behaviors 
to lessen her distress, including dressing conservatively 
]^[ avoiding social situations. Although these factors 
might complicate treatment (e.g., Caroline may try to 
please the therapist, refuse treatment exercises such as 
writing, etc.), the therapist can easily work with Caroline 
to help her realize that, just as in OCD, other sources of 
anxiety can be subsumed under the same model; that is, 
avoidance is strengthened by the removal of anxiety ]^[ 
the more you do it, the easier it gets. Caroline’s social 
anxiety might well be incorporated directly into treatment. In fact, discussing this source of anxiety is a good 
opportunity to test whether she understands the basic 
premise behind the behavioral model of anxiety ]^[ to 
have her develop ]^[ implement exposure exercises. 
What Does the Future Hold ]f[ Treatment? 
As noted above, there is a large body of research 
supporting the use of EX/RP ]f[ OCD. Caroline’s 
prognosis will depend largely upon her progress during 
treatment. Most studies assessing long-term follow-up 
suggest that the majority of patients that respond to CBT 
maintain their treatment gains ]^[ that the better a 
person does in EX/RP in the short run the better off they 
will likely be in the long run (Simpson et al., 2005; Whittal 
et al., in press). Caroline has several indicators of a positive 
prognosis, including the fact that she is seeking treatment 
(suggesting some level of motivation), has a social support 
system (husband ]^[ family), ]^[ a symptom profile that 
is amenable to EX/RP. However, as a general rule, we tell 
patients to expect that there will be periodic instances in 
the future that will prompt OCD exacerbations while 
simultaneously encouraging them that if they anticipate 
]^[ recognize these flare-ups, they now have the tools 
necessary to help them effectively manage the symptoms.
