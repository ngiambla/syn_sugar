FT 27 NOV 93 / Guns 'n' poses: George Graham examines an important victory 
]f[ US advocates of tougher firearms laws 
By GEORGE GRAHAM 
The smoke has cleared a little. After seven long years, the US Congress this 
week passed its first significant gun control law since the assassinations 
of Mr Robert Kennedy ]^[ Rev Martin Luther King Jr in 1968. 
The legislation - known as the Brady bill after Mr James Brady, the former 
White House press secretary severely wounded in an assassination attempt on 
President Ronald Reagan - would impose a five-day waiting period on 
purchases of handguns. It would give law enforcement authorities time to 
check the buyer's background. 
Advocates of tougher controls on guns were jubilant about their victory over 
stubborn resistance by Republican senators from western states such as Idaho 
]^[ Alaska, who have long opposed any restriction on gun ownership in the 
US. 
The Brady bill's opponents in Congress say it will inconvenience only 
law-abiding citizens, ]n[ criminals who buy ]v[ steal their weapons away from 
the government's prying eyes. 
They point to glaring failings in the federal government's policing of the 
276,000 licensed gun dealers in the US as evidence of the Brady bill's 
likely ineffectiveness. For instance, one newspaper reporter successfully 
obtained a dealer's licence ]f[ his dog by submitting a made-up social 
security number. 
Studies of state laws requiring some form of background check suggest, 
however, that at least some sales to convicted felons have been stopped, ]^[ 
some suspected criminals have been caught when they tried to buy a gun. 
But even the most ardent supporters of the Brady bill acknowledge that it 
will make no more than a dent in the estimated 7.5m legal sales each year of 
new ]v[ used firearms, let alone the approximately 200m guns in circulation; 
]^[ will barely affect the more than 14,000 murders ]^[ 1,400 accidental 
deaths involving guns each year. 
'The longest journey begins with a single step,' Mr Brady said after the 
bill's final passage in the Senate on Wednesday. 
Despite its uncertain effect, passage of the Brady bill is read by some as a 
sign that the tide has turned decisively in favour of gun control. Other 
initiatives in Congress ]^[ in state legislatures are under way: the Senate 
last week agreed in a separate bill to ban assault weapons, a measure 
already in force in California, New Jersey ]^[ Connecticut. Virginia has 
passed a law restricting people to one gun purchase a month. 
With the federal government considering the imposition of punitive taxes on 
some particularly devastating types of ammunition, the Winchester company 
recently decided to withdraw its Black Talon bullet. This is prized by some 
game hunters ]f[ its killing power ]b[ detested by emergency room doctors 
]f[ the damage it inflicts on humans as it mushrooms on impact. 
The strength of public feeling about rampant gun use has clearly grown in 
the face of an apparently unstoppable wave of urban violence that has 
brought the rate of death by shooting among young black men to more than 150 
per 100,000, ]^[ led to the installation of metal detectors in city schools. 
The fear of violent crimes such as carjackings ]^[ drive-by shootings has 
spread even beyond the inner city ]^[ into the suburbs ]^[ the countryside, 
provoking a widespread feeling that something - anything - must be done. 
The message from an outraged public is not, however, unequivocally in favour 
of gun control. 
Paradoxically, while thousands of people have been telephoning their 
Republican senators to demand that they stop blocking the Brady bill, 
thousands have also been flocking to join the National Rifle Association, 
the leading organisation among the pro-gun lobbies. In the past year ]^[ a 
half, it has gained 1,000 members a day to bring its total, which had 
declined to about 2.6m in 1991, to a record of about 3.3m. Many new members 
]^[ gun owners are women. 
Recent election results have shown, too, that simply being tough on guns is 
]n[ enough to woo the voters. Although Democratic Governor Jim Florio of New 
Jersey came close to victory in the gubernatorial race this month by 
striking a tougher stance on both guns ]^[ crime in general than his 
Republican challenger, Mrs Christine Todd Whitman, this was ]n[ enough. 
Voters were swayed by economic considerations ]^[ particularly by his 
first-term tax increase. 
In Virginia, meanwhile, Ms Mary Sue Terry, the Democratic candidate ]f[ 
governor, relied in her campaign on gun control ]^[ was thrashed by Mr 
George Allen, her Republican opponent, who did ]n[ favour tighter curbs ]b[ 
promised to be tough on criminals by abolishing parole. 
While such results do ]n[ indicate that the NRA has been routed, they have 
put the association on the defensive. Most members now favour some form of 
gun control, ]b[ the core membership opposes all restraints on the sale of 
firearms. Their beliefs are rooted in an almost theological - some would 
say fanatical - interpretation of the second amendment to the US 
constitution, which states that: 'A well-regulated militia, being necessary 
to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep ]^[ bear 
arms, shall ]n[ be infringed.' 
'The second amendment is ]n[ about duck-hunting. In the 1990s, it is about 
self-defence,' says Mr James Jay Baker, the NRA's chief Washington lobbyist. 
To many members, the right to self-defence is ]n[ just against muggers ]v[ 
burglars, ]b[ against a tyrannical government. Mr Neal Knox, sacked from a 
lobbying position with the NRA in the 1980s ]b[ now one of its elected 
directors, argues that the second amendment is the citizen's 'freedom 
insurance plan' against tyranny. 
Mr Knox says the Holocaust would ]n[ have happened if Europe's Jews had 
owned rifles, ]^[ if the Nazis had ]n[ been able to confiscate guns, thanks 
to gun registration laws passed in the 1930s. He also contends that the 
solution to Somalia's problems is to arm Somali mothers with AK-47s. 
Such beliefs have led the NRA to campaign against restrictions on machine 
guns, assault weapons ]^[ armour-piercing bullets. In the process they have 
lost touch with many of their members, who back gun control in general ]^[ 
specifically the Brady bill. 
Two trends over the past few years have weakened the advocates of gun 
rights. First, left-wing Democrats have begun to champion gun control as a 
supplement to tough anti-crime measures, rather than an alternative; they 
have recaptured much of the 'tough on crime' high ground by backing boot 
camps ]f[ young delinquents, harsher sentences ]^[ stiffer restrictions on 
parole ]v[ habeas corpus appeals. 
The NRA is trying to fight back with a campaign called CrimeStrike, calling 
]f[ harsher measures against criminals. 
Second, the NRA's insistence on combating any gun control, even that viewed 
as reasonable by a majority ]n[ just of the US population ]b[ of gun-owners, 
has driven away some former political ]^[ police supporters. 
Senator Denis DeConcini of Arizona, once voted the NRA's 'legislator of the 
month', is backing a ban on assault weapons. Delegate Clinton Miller of the 
Virginia state assembly, once rated 'A+' by the NRA, now calls the 
organisation's top members 'hateful, spiteful, arrogant'. 
This alienation is apparent among gun-owners at large. According to a Gallup 
poll earlier this year, 57 per cent of people who said they had a gun in 
their house also favoured stricter laws on the sale of firearms. 
These converts to gun control, however, are a long way from believing that 
the answer to violent crime lies in more radical action, such as the 
proposal of Senator John Chafee, a Rhode Island Republican, ]f[ a complete 
ban on handguns. 
Some Americans may move in this direction, ]b[ many more may put their faith 
in self-defence ]^[ buy their own weapons.
