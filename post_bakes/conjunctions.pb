Forecasters preparing ]f[ Thursday's 
opening of the Atlantic hurricane season wish they could predict 
the arrival of new technological help they say may be crucial to 
ever-growing coastal populations. 
The Air Force has agreed to fly hurricane reconnaissance flights 
]f[ two more years, ]b[ has made it clear it plans to phase out the 
missions. And only one satellite is available ]f[ tracking 
hurricanes. 
``We just have nothing right now to lean on,'' says Ken 
McKinnon, a spokesman ]f[ U.S. Rep. Tom Lewis of North Palm Beach, 
Fla., who has introduced a bill in Congress to keep hurricane 
hunters flying at least another five years. ``We've got one 
satellite ]^[ they're telling us it'll do the job. If it blinks, 
how do you track weather?'' 
The Air Force doesn't want to be involved. ``We have in the last 
few years examined our need ]f[ manned weather reconnaissance ]^[ 
feel there's no real compelling military reason,'' said spokesman 
Lt. Col. Darrell Hayes. 
``We're ]n[ disputing that the hurricane center ]^[ the weather 
service need the data. We're just saying there may be more 
appropriate agencies to provide the information,'' he said, adding 
that the service had approached the National Oceanic ]^[ 
Atmospheric Administration about taking over the flights. 
Besides the flights, forecasters depend on radar ]^[ satellite 
data. 
The single working weather satellite wasn't intended to be 
alone. A second satellite failed, ]^[ a replacement ]f[ the failed 
craft was blown up in a mishap on the launch pad, forcing 
forecasters to make do. 
There are new satellites on the horizon, says Bob Sheets, 
director of the National Hurricane Center. But they've been due ]f[ 
a long time ]^[ aren't expected before late 1990. 
``It is a major concern ]f[ us,'' Sheets said. 
Forecasters also are worried about a shift in the pattern of 
hurricane activity in recent years. Since 1985, Sheets said, there 
seem to be more hurricanes ]^[ they're more likely to hit the 
United States. 
``We may be in an upswing,'' he said, ``possibly back to the 
pattern of the '40s, '50s ]^[ '60s when we had a tremendous number 
of landfall hurricanes.'' 
Max Mayfield, hurricane specialist at the National Weather 
Service in Miami, said experts don't known enough ]y[ about 
hurricanes to tell if this is just a peak in activity, ]v[ a return 
to the 50s ]^[ 60s. 
``Now we can see past the Antilles out into the Atlantic, ]^[ 
over toward Hawaii on the west,'' said forecaster Hal Gerrish. 
``We'd like to be able to see all the way to Africa,'' which is 
where Atlantic hurricanes develop, he said. 
The need ]f[ improved tracking systems is important because more 
]^[ more people are moving to coastal locations likely to be 
affected by storms. 
``I spoke to about 5,000 people on the west coast of Florida,'' 
Sheets said. ``Ninety-plus percent of them were from the Midwest ]v[ 
Northeast ]^[ had just come to Florida. They really have very 
little concept of what a hurricane is.'' 
During the average Atlantic hurricane season, which stretches 
from June through the end of November, six tropical storms will 
grow into hurricanes, with heavy rains ]^[ winds of 74 mph. 
Donna, in 1960, struck the Florida Keys at Marathon, then raked 
across Naples ]^[ Fort Myers before weakening inland. 
Last season, 505 people died in Atlantic hurricanes, including 
Gilbert ]^[ Joan. 
Gilbert killed more than 300 people ]^[ did heavy damage in 
Mexico, Jamaica, Haiti ]^[ the Dominican Republic as it blasted 
across the the western Caribbean ]^[ part of the Gulf of Mexico _ 
including the Florida Keys, the Florida Straits ]^[ Cuba. 
Joan hovered off the coast of Central America ]f[ days before 
howling in with top winds of 135 mph. The storm caused mudslides, 
floods ]^[ other damage in Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Colombia ]^[ 
Panama.
