Cognitive Processing Therapy: Veteran/Military Version 
Part 1 
Introduction to Cognitive Processing Therapy 
Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT) is a 12-session therapy that has been found effective 
]f[ both PTSD ]^[ other corollary symptoms following traumatic events (Monson et al, 2006; 
Resick et al, 2002; Resick & Schnicke, 1992, 19931). Although the research on CPT focused on 
rape victims originally, we have used the therapy successfully with a range of other traumatic 
events, including military-related traumas. This revision of the manual is in response to requests 
]f[ a treatment manual that focuses exclusively on military trauma. The manual has been 
updated to reflect changes in the therapy over time, particularly with an increase in the amount of 
practice that is assigned ]^[ with some of the handouts. It also includes suggestions from almost 
two decades of clinical experience with the therapy. 
Also included in this manual is a module ]f[ traumatic bereavement. This module is ]n[ 
included as one of the 12 sessions ]b[ could be added to the therapy. We recommend that the 
session be added early in therapy, perhaps as the second session along with the educational 
component on posttraumatic stress disorder. Although we expect PTSD to remit as a result of 
treatment, we do ]n[ necessarily expect bereavement to remit. Grief is a normal reaction to loss 
]^[ is ]n[ a disorder. Bereavement may have a long ]^[ varied course. The goal of dealing with 
grief issues within CPT is ]n[ to shorten the natural course of adjustment, ]b[ to remove blocks 
]^[ barriers (distorted cognitions, assumptions, expectations) that are interfering with normal 
bereavement. Therefore, the focus is on normal grief, myths about bereavement, ]^[ stuck 
points that therapists may need to focus on in this domain. If the bereavement session is added to 
CPT, then the assignment to write an impact statement would be delayed one session (see 
Session 1) ]f[ those who have PTSD due to a traumatic death. Another possibility is to have the 
patients write two impact statements ]f[ those who both lost a loved one ]^[ have PTSD related 
to something that happened to them directly. One statement would be about what it means that 
the traumatic event happened to them. The other statement would be about what it means that the 
loved one has died. 
Many therapists were never trained to conduct manualized psychotherapies ]^[ may feel 
uncomfortable with both the concept ]^[ the execution. It is important that the patient ]^[ 
therapist agree on the goal ]f[ the therapy (trauma work ]f[ PTSD ]^[ related symptoms) ]s[ that 
the goals do ]n[ drift ]v[ switch from session to session. Without a firm commitment to the

treatment goals, when the therapy is “off track”, the therapist may ]n[ know whether to get back 
on the protocol ]v[ to let it slide. As other topics arise, the therapist sometimes isn’t sure whether 
]v[ how to incorporate them into the sessions. A few words on these topics are appropriate here. 
Once therapists have conducted protocol therapy a few times, they usually find that they become 
more efficient ]^[ effective therapists. They learn to guide the therapy without tangents ]v[ 
delays. They find they can develop rapport with patients through the use of Socratic questions 
because the patients are explaining to the therapist exactly how they feel ]^[ think ]^[ the 
therapist expresses interest ]^[ understanding with these questions. There is usually enough time 
in the session to cover the material ]f[ the session ]^[ still have time ]f[ some other topics, such 
as things that came up that week ]v[ considering other current issues related to their PTSD 
(childrearing, job concerns marital issues, etc.). However if those are major issues, then the 
therapist will need to prioritize the order. It would be inadvisable to try to deal with several 
types of therapy ]f[ different problems simultaneously. 
Normally, comorbid depression, anxiety, ]^[ dissociation remit along with PTSD, ]s[ we 
rarely believe there is a need to deal with other symptoms independently of the PTSD protocol. 
Substance dependence should be treated prior to addressing PTSD, ]b[ substance abusing 
patients may be treated with CPT if there is a specific contract ]f[ ]n[ drinking abusively during 
the therapy ]^[ if there is a specific focus on the suspected role of abusive drinking as avoidance 
coping (for more information on comorbidity see Section 3). Typically we have the patients 
focus on specific child, family, ]^[ marital issues after completing the course of PTSD 
treatment. Sometimes those problems remit when the patient no longer has PTSD interfering 
with functioning. Other considerations regarding comorbidity are found later in the manual. 
Most veterans present ]f[ PTSD treatment many years after the traumatic event. They 
are usually ]n[ in crisis ]^[ are able to handle their day-to-day lives (at whatever level they are 
functioning) without constant intervention. Much of the disruption in the flow of therapy ]f[ 
PTSD comes from avoidance attempts on the part of the patient. We point out avoidance 
whenever we see it (e.g., changing the subject, showing up late ]f[ sessions), ]^[ remind the 
patient that avoidance maintains PTSD symptoms. If the patient wants to discuss other issues, we 
save time at the end of the session ]v[ attempt to incorporate their issues into the skills that are 
being taught (i.e., A-B-C sheets, Challenging Questions, Patterns of Problematic Thinking, 
Challenging Beliefs worksheets). If the patient does ]n[ bring in practice assignments, we do ]n[ 
delay the session, ]b[ conduct the work in session ]^[ then reassign the practice assignment 
along with the next assignment. 
Returning OEF/OIF veterans may have different needs than older veterans. They may 
prefer two sessions a week ]s[ that they can get therapy finished quickly. They may request early 
morning ]v[ evening appointments to accommodate their jobs. They may want their PTSD 
treatment augmented with couples counseling. They may appear a bit more “raw” than the very 
chronic Vietnam veterans that most VA clinicians are accustomed to working with. The more 
accessible emotions are actually an advantage in processing the traumatic events ]^[ in 
motivating change, ]b[ therapists who have worked with only very chronic (and numbed) 
veterans may become alarmed when they first work with these patients. They may think that 
strong emotions ]v[ dissociation should be stabilized ]v[ medicated first. However, CPT was 
developed ]^[ tested first with rape victims who may also be very acute ]^[ very emotional. As 
4 
long as patients are willing to engage in therapy ]^[ can contract against self-harm ]^[ acting 
out, there is no reason to assume that they need to wait ]f[ treatment. 
It is recommended that the patient be assessed, ]n[ just before ]^[ after treatment, ]b[ 
during treatment as well. We typically give patients a brief PTSD scale ]^[ a depression scale 
(if comorbid depression is a problem) once a week. Most often there is a large drop in symptoms 
when the assimilation about the trauma is resolving. Typically this occurs around the 5th ]v[ 6th 
session with the written exposure ]^[ cognitive therapy focusing on the traumatic event itself. 
Occasionally this takes longer, ]b[ with frequent assessment, the therapist can monitor the 
progress ]^[ see when the shift occurs. 
Theory 
CPT is based on a social cognitive theory of PTSD that focuses on how the traumatic event 
is construed ]^[ coped with by a person who is trying to regain a sense of mastery ]^[ control in 
his/her life. The other major theory explaining PTSD is Lang’s2 (1977) information processing 
theory, which was extended to PTSD by Foa, Steketee, ]^[ Rothbaum3 (1989) in their emotional 
processing theory of PTSD. In this theory, PTSD is believed to emerge due to the development of 
a fear network in memory that elicits escape ]^[ avoidance behavior. Mental fear structures 
include stimuli, responses, ]^[ meaning elements. Anything associated with the trauma may elicit 
the fear structure ]v[ schema ]^[ subsequent avoidance behavior. The fear network in people with 
PTSD is thought to be stable ]^[ broadly generalized ]s[ that it is easily accessed. When the fear 
network is activated by reminders of the trauma, the information in the network enters 
consciousness (intrusive symptoms). Attempts to avoid this activation result in the avoidance 
symptoms of PTSD. According to emotional processing theory, repetitive exposure to the 
traumatic memory in a safe environment will result in habituation of the fear ]^[ subsequent 
change in the fear structure. As emotion decreases, patients with PTSD will begin to modify their 
meaning elements spontaneously ]^[ will change their self-statements ]^[ reduce their 
generalization. Repeated exposures to the traumatic memory are thought to result in habituation ]v[ 
a change in the information about the event, ]^[ subsequently, the fear structure. 
Although social cognitive theories are ]n[ incompatible with information/emotional 
processing theories, these theories focus beyond the development of a fear network to other 
pertinent affective responses such as horror, anger, sadness, humiliation, ]v[ guilt. Some emotions 
such as fear, anger, ]v[ sadness may emanate directly from the trauma (primary emotions), 
because the event is interpreted as dangerous, abusive, and/or resulting in losses. It is possible 
that secondary, ]v[ manufactured, emotions can also result from faulty interpretations made by the 
patient. For example, if someone is intentionally attacked by another person, the danger of the 
situation would lead to a fight-flight response ]^[ the attending emotions might be anger ]v[ fear 
(primary). However, if in the aftermath, the person blamed himself ]v[ herself ]f[ the attack, the 
person might experience shame ]v[ embarrassment. These manufactured emotions would have

resulted from thoughts ]^[ interpretations about the event, rather than the event itself. As long as 
the individual keeps saying that the event was their fault, they keep producing shame (hence, 
manufactured). 
Social-cognitive theories focus more on the content of cognitions ]^[ the effect that 
distorted cognitions have upon emotional responses ]^[ behavior. In order to reconcile the 
information about the traumatic event with prior schemas, people tend to do one ]v[ more of three 
things: assimilate, accommodate, ]v[ over-accommodate. Assimilation is altering the incoming 
information to match prior beliefs (“Because a bad thing happened to me, I must have been 
punished ]f[ something I did”). Accommodation is altering beliefs enough to incorporate the 
new information (“Although I didn’t use good judgment in that situation, most of the time I make 
good decisions”). Over-accommodation is altering ones beliefs about oneself ]^[ the world to 
the extreme in order to feel safer ]^[ more in control (“I can’t ever trust my judgment again”). 
Obviously, therapists are working toward accommodation, a balance in beliefs that takes into 
account the reality of the traumatic event without going overboard. 
In a social-cognitive model, affective expression is needed, ]n[ ]f[ habituation, ]b[ in 
order ]f[ the affective elements of the stored trauma memory to be changed. It is assumed that 
the natural affect, once accessed, will dissipate rather quickly, ]^[ will no longer be stored with 
the trauma memory. Also, the work of accommodating the memory ]^[ beliefs can begin. Once 
faulty beliefs regarding the event (self-blame, guilt) ]^[ over-generalized beliefs about oneself 
]^[ the world (e.g. safety, trust, control esteem, intimacy) are challenged, then the secondary 
emotions will also decrease along with the intrusive reminders. The explanation that CPT 
therapists give to patients about this process is described in Session 1 along with a handout in the 
patient materials section. 
Because we know that PTSD symptoms are nearly universal immediately following a 
serious traumatic stressor ]^[ that recovery takes a few months under normal circumstances, it 
may be best to think about diagnosable PTSD as a disruption ]v[ stalling out of a normal recovery 
process, rather than the development of a unique psychopathology. The therapist needs to 
determine what has interfered with normal recovery. In one case, it may be that the patient 
believes that he will be overwhelmed by the amount of affect that will emerge if he stops 
avoiding ]^[ numbing himself. Perhaps he was taught as a child that emotions are bad, that “real 
men” don’t have feelings ]^[ that he should “just get over it”. In another case, a patient may 
have refused to talk about what happened with anyone because she blames herself ]f[ “letting” 
the event happen ]^[ she is ]s[ shamed ]^[ humiliated that she is convinced that others will 
blame her too. In a third case, a patient saw something ]s[ horrifying that every time he falls 
asleep ]^[ dreams about it, he wakes up in a cold sweat. In order to sleep, he has started drinking 
heavily. Another patient is ]s[ convinced that she will be victimized again that she refuses to go 
out any more ]^[ has greatly restricted her activities ]^[ relationships. In still another case, in 
which other people were killed, a patient experiences survivor guilt ]^[ obsesses over why he 
was spared when others were killed. He feels unworthy ]^[ experiences guilt whenever he 
laughs ]v[ finds himself enjoying something. In all of these cases, thoughts ]v[ avoidance 
behaviors are interfering with emotional processing ]^[ cognitive restructuring. There are as 
many individual examples of things that can block a smooth recovery as there are individuals 
with PTSD.

Overview 
The contents of each session are described along with issues that therapists are likely to 
encounter. The therapy begins with an education component about PTSD ]^[ the patient is asked 
to write an Impact Statement in order ]f[ the patient ]^[ therapist to begin to identify problem 
areas in thinking about the event (i.e., “stuck points”). The patient is then taught to identify ]^[ 
label thoughts ]^[ feelings ]^[ to recognize the relationship between them. Then the next two 
sessions focus on generating a written account of the worst traumatic incident, which is read to 
the therapist in session. During the first five sessions, the therapist uses Socratic questioning to 
begin to challenge distorted cognitions, particularly those associated with assimilation like selfblame, hindsight bias ]^[ other guilt cognitions. Thereafter, the sessions focus on teaching the 
patient cognitive therapy skills ]^[ finally focus on specific topics that are likely to have been 
disrupted by the traumatic event: safety, trust, power/control, esteem, ]^[ intimacy. 
After the individual CPT protocol is described in detail, there are subsequent sections on 
using the protocol without the written trauma exposure component, a section on delivering CPT 
in a group format ]^[ a section on treatment issues with comorbid disorders, 
It is strongly recommended that the protocol be implemented in the order presented here. 
The skills ]^[ exercises are designed to build upon one another, ]^[ even the modules in the last 
five sessions follow in the hierarchical order in which they are likely to emerge with patients. 
However, when used individually, the last five sessions may be modified depending upon the 
particular issues that a patient reports. For example, if a patient has severe safety issues, ]b[ no 
issues with esteem ]v[ intimacy, then the therapist may want to skip the later two modules ]^[ 
focus more time on safety. Conversely, if someone had no safety ]v[ control issues ]b[ was 
primarily troubled with self-trust ]^[ self-esteem issues, then the therapist may want to spend 
more time on those modules. However, even if a patient has ]n[ mentioned an issue within a 
particular domain of functioning (safety, trust, power/control, esteem, intimacy), it may be 
helpful ]f[ him to read the module ]^[ complete worksheets on any stuck points that become 
apparent. It is ]n[ unusual ]f[ the modules to reveal issues that had ]n[ been identified earlier in 
therapy. 
The usual format ]f[ sessions is to begin with review of the practice assignments, 
followed by the content of each specific session. During the last 15 minutes of the session, the 
assignment ]f[ the next week is introduced ]^[ is accompanied by the necessary explanation, 
definition(s), ]^[ handout. It is ]n[ recommended that the therapist start a general discussion at 
the beginning of the session, ]b[ should begin immediately with the practice assignment that was 
assigned. If the patient wishes to speak about other topics, we either use the topic to teach the 
new skills we are introducing (e.g., put the content on an A-B-C sheet) ]v[ we save time at the end 
]f[ these other topics, reinforcing the trauma work with discussion of the topic. If the therapist 
allows the patient to direct the therapy away from the protocol, the avoidance will be reinforced, 
along with disruption in the flow of the therapy. In addition, placing the practice assignments last 
in the session will send a message to the patient that the practice assignments are ]n[ very 
important ]^[ may lead to less treatment adherence on the part of the patient. Among the most 
difficult skills ]f[ the therapist to master, especially if s/he has been trained in more non-directive 
7 
therapies, is how to be empathic ]b[ firm in maintaining the protocol. If a patient does ]n[ bring 
in his/her practice assignment one session, it does ]n[ mean that the therapy is delayed ]f[ a 
week. The therapist has the patient do the assignment orally (or they complete a worksheet 
together) in the session ]^[ reassigns the uncompleted assignment along with the next 
assignment. 
Part 2 
Cognitive Processing Therapy: Session by Session 
It is presumed that the therapist will have conducted some form of assessment of the patient’s 
traumatic event ]^[ persistent symptoms, ]^[ specifically contracted to do a course of CPT prior 
to undertaking the first session. At least a brief assessment of PTSD ]^[ depressive symptoms 
should be conducted. There are several brief PTSD checklists ]^[ depression scales that can be 
used to assess pretreatment symptoms, as well as to conduct repeated assessments during therapy 
to monitor the course of treatment. 
Session 1: Introduction ]^[ Education Phase 
Therapist Overview 
Overall, there are several goals ]f[ the first session: 1) build rapport with the patient, 2) 
to educate the patient regarding symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder ]^[ depression, 3) to 
provide a rationale ]f[ treatment based on a cognitive conceptualization of PTSD, 4) to lay out 
the course of treatment, ]^[ 5) to elicit treatment compliance. 
It is necessary to address compliance early in the course of therapy because avoidance 
behavior (half of the symptoms of PTSD) can interfere with successful treatment. We are 
concerned with two forms of compliance: attendance ]^[ completion of out-of-session practice 
assignments. It is strongly recommended that patients attend all sessions ]^[ complete all 
assignments in order to benefit fully from therapy. We attempt to set the expectation that 
therapy benefit is dependent on the amount of effort they invest through practice assignment 
compliance ]^[ practice with new skills. It may be helpful to remind the patient that what he4 has 
been doing has ]n[ been working, ]^[ that it will be important to tackle issues head-on rather 
than continue to avoid. Avoidance of affective experience ]^[ expression should also be 
addressed. 
In this session, patients are also given the opportunity to ask any questions they may have 
about the therapy. Sometimes patients’ stuck points become evident in the questions ]^[ 
concerns they express during this first session. And finally, as with all therapies, rapport 
building is crucial ]f[ effective therapy. The patient needs to feel understood ]^[ listened to, 
otherwise she may ]n[ return. 
4 
Because of the awkwardness of the English language ]^[ the desire to refer to a single patient, the pronouns “he” 
]^[ “she” will be used alternately, rather than saying “she/he”, “him/her” throughout the manual. The term soldier 
will also be used as a generic term rather than soldier, marine, sailor, airman etc., ]^[ will be used interchangeably 
with veteran. 
8 
Patients sometimes arrive with a press to speak about their story. However, the therapist 
should prevent the patient from engaging in an extended exposure session at the first session. 
Intense affect ]^[ graphic details of an event, disclosed before any type of rapport ]v[ trust has 
been established, may well lead to premature termination from therapy. The patient is likely to 
assume that the therapist holds the same opinions regarding his guilt, shame, ]v[ worthlessness 
that he, the patient, holds, ]^[ may be afraid to return to therapy after such a disclosure. 
Other patients will be very reluctant to discuss the traumatic event ]^[ will be quite 
relieved that they do ]n[ have to describe it in detail during the first session. In these cases, the 
therapist may have to draw out even a brief description of the event. Dissociation when 
attempting to think about ]v[ talk about the event is common. An initial assessment session grants 
the patient ]^[ therapist the opportunity to get acquainted before the therapy begins, ]^[ allows 
the therapist to provide the patient with a description of what the therapy will entail. In this first 
session, it is important that the therapist remind the patient that CPT is a very structured form of 
therapy, ]^[ that the first session is a bit different from the others because the therapist will do 
more talking. The therapist begins with a description of the symptoms of PTSD ]^[ a cognitive 
formulation of them. 
Therapist explanations to patient 
1. PTSD symptoms 
"In going over the results of your testing, we found that you are suffering from posttraumatic stress disorder. The symptoms of PTSD fall into three clusters. The first cluster is the 
re-experiencing of the event in some way. This includes nightmares about the event ]v[ other 
scary dreams; flashbacks, when you act ]v[ feel as if the incident is recurring; intrusive thoughts, 
which are memories that suddenly pop into your mind. You might have the intrusive thoughts 
when there is something in the environment to remind you of the event (including anniversaries 
of the event) ]v[ even when there is nothing there to remind you of it. Common times to have 
these memories are when you are falling asleep, when you relax, ]v[ when you are bored. These 
symptoms are all normal following such a traumatic event. You are ]n[ going crazy. Can you 
give me examples of these experiences in your own life since the event?... 
"A second set of symptoms concern arousal5. As might be expected, when reminded of the 
event, you are likely to experience very strong emotions. Along with these feelings are physical 
reactions. Indicators of arousal symptoms include problems falling ]v[ staying asleep, irritability 
]v[ outbursts of anger, difficulty concentrating, startle reactions like jumping at noises ]v[ if 
someone walks up behind you, always feeling on guard ]v[ looking over your shoulder even when 
there is no reason to. Which of these do you experience?... 
"The third cluster of symptoms is avoidance of reminders of the event. A natural reaction to 
intrusive reminders ]^[ strong emotional reactions is the urge to push these thoughts ]^[ 
feelings away. You might avoid places ]v[ people who remind you of the event. Some people 
avoid watching certain television programs ]v[ turn off the TV. Some people avoid reading the 
newspaper ]v[ watching the news. You might avoid thinking about the event ]^[ letting yourself 
5 
Although avoidance is listed second in the DSM, it makes more sense to present the symptoms to patients in their 
most likely order, intrusion, arousal, ]^[ avoidance. This way the explanation ]f[ the symptoms follows logically 
from their description. 
9 
feel your feelings about the event. There might be certain sights, sounds, ]v[ smells that you find 
yourself avoiding ]v[ escaping from because they remind you of the event. Sometimes people 
have trouble remembering all ]v[ part of the event. Sometimes people feel numb ]^[ cut-off from 
the world around them. This feeling of detachment ]v[ numbness is another form of avoidance. 
Sometimes it is described as feeling as though you are watching life from behind glass. Which 
things ]v[ thoughts do you avoid ]v[ run away from?... Have you felt numb ]v[ shut off from your 
emotions?... Have you found yourself feeling disconnected from other people? 
2. Trauma Recovery ]^[ Fight-Flight Response 
“Many people are exposed to traumatic events. In the time immediately following a trauma, 
most people will have the symptoms of PTSD that we just talked about. However, over time, ]f[ 
many people, those symptoms naturally decrease, ]^[ they are ]n[ diagnosed with PTSD. In 
other words, they naturally recover from the traumatic event. There are some people who do ]n[ 
recover ]^[ are later diagnosed with PTSD. Based on that, it is helpful to think of PTSD as a 
problem in recovery. Something got in the way of you having that natural process of recovery, 
]^[ our work together is to determine what got in the way ]^[ to change it ]s[ that you can 
recover from what happened. We will be working to get you ‘unstuck’”. 
There are some different reasons why you may be having trouble recovering. First, there 
may be an automatic component during the event that you should consider as you evaluate how 
you responded during the event. When people face serious, possibly life-threatening events, they 
are likely to experience a very strong physical reaction called the fight-flight reaction. More 
recently we have learned that there is a third possibility, the freeze response. In the fight-flight 
reaction, your body is trying to get you ready to fight ]v[ flee danger. The goal here is to get all 
the blood ]^[ oxygen out to your hands, feet, ]^[ big muscle groups like your thighs ]^[ 
forearms ]s[ that you can run ]v[ fight. In order to do that quickly, the blood leaves your stomach 
]v[ your head. You might feel like you have been kicked in the gut ]v[ are going to faint. Your 
body stops fighting off diseases ]^[ digesting food. You are ]n[ thinking about your philosophy 
of life ]^[ may have trouble thinking at all. The same thing happens with the freeze response, ]b[ 
in this case your body is trying to reduce both physical ]^[ emotional pain. You may have 
stopped feeling pain ]v[ had the sense that the event was happening to someone else as if it were 
a movie. You might have been completely shut down emotionally ]v[ even had shifts in 
perception like you are out of your body ]v[ that time has slowed down. 
If you have been thinking now of other things that you could have done then, you might 
need to consider what your state of mind was during the event. Did you have all possible options 
available to you? Did you know then what you know now? Do you have different skills now than 
you did then? 
Second, the fight-flight response that you were experiencing during the traumatic event can 
get quickly paired with cues, ]v[ things in the environment, that didn’t have any particular 
meaning before. Then later, when you encounter those cues, you are likely to have another fightflight reaction. Your nervous system senses the cue, which could be a sight, a sound, smell, ]v[ 
even a time, ]^[ then your body reacts as though you are in danger again. These reactions will 
fade over time if you don’t avoid those cues. However, if you avoid reminder cues, your body 
won’t learn that these are not, in fact, good danger cues. They don’t tell you very accurately 
10 
whether you are actually in danger ]s[ you may have false alarms going off frequently. After a 
while you won’t trust your own senses ]v[ judgment about what is ]^[ isn’t dangerous, ]^[ too 
many situations seem dangerous that are not. 
You may start to have thoughts about the dangerousness of the world, particular places, 
]v[ situations that are based on your reactions rather than the actual realistic danger of those 
situations. This leads us to examine how your thoughts may affect your reactions. Besides 
thoughts about dangerousness, many different types of beliefs about ourselves ]^[ the world can 
be affected by traumatic events. 
3. 
Cognitive Theory 
“As you were growing up you learned about the world ]^[ organized it into categories 
]v[ beliefs. For example, when you were small, you learned that a thing with a back, seat ]^[ 
four legs is a chair. In the beginning you just called all of them 'chair'. You may have even 
called a couch a chair ]v[ a stool a chair because they had a back, seat, ]^[ four legs. Later, as 
you got older, through experience, you learned more complex categories, ]s[ you may have 
learned dining room chair, rocking chair, recliner ]v[ folding chair. We develop many categories 
of ideas ]^[ beliefs about others, the world, ]^[ ourselves, as well as ]f[ objects. 
One common belief that many people get while growing up is that 'good things happen to 
good people ]^[ bad things happen to bad people.' This is called the 'just world belief.' You 
may have learned this through your religion, your parents, your teachers, ]v[ you may have 
picked it up as a way to make the world seem safer ]^[ more predictable. It makes more sense 
when you are young. For example, parents wouldn’t want to say, ‘If you do something you’re 
]n[ supposed to, you may ]v[ may ]n[ get in trouble.’ However, as we grow up, we realize that 
the world is more complex than that, just like how we learn that there are all different types of 
chairs. If you have ever had things go bad ]^[ you said 'Why me?,' then you have a just world 
belief. 
"When an unexpected event occurs that doesn't fit your beliefs, there are different ways that 
you may try to make it fit. One way that you may have tried to make the event ]^[ your beliefs fit 
is by changing your memories ]v[ interpretation of the event to fit with your pre-existing beliefs 
(assimilation). Examples of changing your interpretations/memories of the event are to blame 
yourself ]f[ ]n[ preventing the event (or protecting loved ones), to have trouble accepting that 
the event happened, to 'forget' that it happened, ]v[ to forget the most horrifying parts. Changing 
the event may seem easier than changing your entire set of beliefs about the world, how people 
behave, ]v[ your beliefs about your safety. 
"It is possible that instead of changing the event, you may change your beliefs to accept 
what happened (accommodation). This is one of our goals ]f[ therapy. Unfortunately, some 
people go overboard ]^[ change their beliefs too much, which may result in a reluctance to 
become intimate ]v[ develop trust, ]^[ increased fear (over-accommodation). Examples that 
reflect an extreme change in beliefs include: thinking that no one can be trusted ]v[ that the world 
is completely dangerous.

“For some people who have had previous negative experiences in their life, traumatic 
events can seem to reinforce ]v[ confirm these previously held beliefs. For example, prior to 
having experienced a trauma you might have believed that others can’t be trusted ]v[ that the 
world is generally unsafe. The traumatic event comes along ]^[ seems to confirm those beliefs. 
Or, maybe you were told that everything was your fault growing up, ]s[ when a bad thing 
happens, it seems to confirm that once again, you are at fault. 
Our goals ]f[ therapy are: 1) to help you accept the reality of the event, 2) to feel your emotions 
about it ]^[ 3) to help you develop balanced ]^[ realistic beliefs about the event, yourself, ]^[ 
others. 
4. 
Types of Emotions 
“There are two kinds of emotions that follow traumatic events. The first type is the feelings 
that follow naturally from the event ]^[ that would be universal: fear when in real danger, anger 
when being intentionally harmed, joy ]v[ happiness with positive events, ]v[ sadness with losses. 
These natural emotions have a natural course. They will ]n[ continue on forever unless there is 
something that you do to feed them. It is important to feel these emotions that you may ]n[ have 
allowed yourself to experience about the event, ]^[ let them run their natural course. 
The second type of emotions, manufactured feelings, result ]n[ directly in response to the 
event, ]b[ based on how you interpret the event. If you have thoughts such as ‘I should have 
rescued other people’ ]v[ ‘I must be a failure that I can’t get over it”, then you will be feeling 
angry at yourself ]v[ shame. These emotions are ]n[ based on the facts of the event, ]b[ on your 
interpretations. The more that you continue to think about the event in these ways, the more ]^[ 
more of the manufactured feelings you are going to have. The upside of the fact that you are 
producing these feelings is that, if you change your thoughts ]^[ interpretations, you will 
change your feelings. Think of your emotions as a fire in a fireplace. The fire has energy to it. 
However, it will burn out if it is ]n[ continually fed. The self-blame ]v[ guilty thoughts can 
continue to feed the emotional fire indefinitely. Take away the fuel of your thoughts, ]^[ the fire 
burns out quickly. 
In order ]f[ you to recover from your traumatic event(s), we will be working together ]f[ 
you to express ]^[ accept your natural emotions ]^[ to adjust the manufactured feelings. 
Brief Review of Most Traumatic Event 
In this first session, the therapist ]^[ patient work together to define the most traumatic 
event that they will work on first. The patient then provides a brief account of the traumatic 
event. It is important the therapist keep the patient contained ]^[ ]n[ conduct an exposure to the 
traumatic material. Most veterans have a ‘public version’ of the incident that they can use that 
does ]n[ elicit much affect. However, if the patient starts to become distressed ]v[ dissociates, the 
therapist should ask questions ]^[ keep the patient grounded in the present. If needed, they can 
stop the patient’s description. The therapist only needs enough of the details to begin to 
hypothesize what problematic interpretations ]^[ cognitions might need to be explored. 
12 
We begin with the worst incident because there is more likely to be generalization of new, 
more balanced cognitions from the worst event to less severe events than the other way around. 
Also, if the patient begins with a less severe event because she believes she cannot handle the 
worst event, she will still believe that after working on this event. If the patient is resistant to 
writing an account about the worst event, the therapist needs to do some cognitive therapy during 
session two ]^[ have the patient complete some A-B-C sheets on her thoughts ]^[ feelings about 
working on the worst event (see sessions 2 ]^[ 3). 
It is helpful to provide an expectation that the patient provide a brief, less affect-charged 
event by providing a timeframe in the request. 
“In order ]f[ me to have a clearer picture of what we will be working on first, could you 
please give me a brief description, about five minutes, of the most traumatic event…” 
If the patient responds that he has multiple traumatic events that disturb him, making it 
difficult ]v[ impossible to choose the ‘most’ traumatic event, first validate the fact that he may 
have multiple distressing events. Then, focus on ascertaining which one seems to be causing the 
most PTSD symptoms by inquiring about the content of his reexperiencing symptoms. The 
therapist can ask, ‘What do you think about ]v[ have flashbacks about the most?’ It may also be 
helpful to probe about his behavioral avoidance symptoms to determine the event that should 
addressed first. Remind the patient that work on the chosen event will very likely impact the 
other events, ]^[ if not, there will be opportunities to work on the other events. 
Therapy Rationale - Stuck Points 
"So, one goal of therapy will be to help you recognize ]^[ modify what you are saying to 
yourself-in other words, your thoughts ]^[ interpretations about the event, which may have 
become automatic. These distorted beliefs may become ]s[ automatic that you aren't even aware 
that you have them. Even though you may ]n[ be aware of what you are saying to yourself, your 
beliefs ]^[ self-statements affect your mood ]^[ your behavior. Often, people aren't aware that 
they are having thoughts about whatever they are experiencing. For example, on the way here 
today, you were probably wondering what this therapy would be like ]v[ what I would be asking 
you to talk about. Do you remember what you were thinking about before the session?... 
"I will be helping you to identify what your automatic thoughts are ]^[ how they influence 
what you feel. I will also teach you ways to challenge ]^[ change what you are saying to 
yourself ]^[ what you believe about yourself ]^[ the event. Some of your beliefs about the event 
will be more balanced than others. You remember that we discussed at the beginning of this 
session about how some people get stuck in their recovery process. We will be focusing on 
changing the beliefs that are interfering with your recovery ]v[ keeping you stuck. We call these 
problematic beliefs ‘stuck points.’ (The patient is given the handout on stuck points ]^[ the 
Stuck Point Log). We will keep a Stuck Point Log in your folder ]s[ as we identify problematic 
ideas we can write them down. Then when we move to different worksheets you will have this list 
to draw on. 
13 
Anticipating Avoidance ]^[ Increasing Compliance 
The patient has been avoiding thinking about the event thereby escaping ]^[ avoiding strong 
]^[ unpleasant emotions. The therapist must develop a strong ]^[ compelling rationale ]f[ 
therapy in order ]f[ the patient to be motivated to do something completely antithetical to what 
they have been doing. It is very important that the patient understand what the therapy consists of 
]^[ why it will work. They should have ample opportunity to ask questions ]^[ express 
concerns. The therapist needs to express confidence, warmth, ]^[ support. 
I cannot emphasize enough how important it is that you ]n[ avoid, which is what you 
usually have done to try to cope since the event. This will be your biggest (and probably 
scariest) hurdle. I cannot help you feel your feelings, ]v[ challenge your thoughts if you don't 
come to therapy ]v[ if you avoid completing your practice assignments. If you find yourself 
wanting to avoid, remind yourself that you are still struggling with the event because you have 
avoided dealing with it head-on. 
The therapist should describe the course of therapy (and the nature of the trauma account in 
sessions four ]^[ five) ]^[ the importance of doing practice assignments. 
“There are 168 hours in a week. We cannot expect you to change your symptoms ]^[ the 
way you have been coping in one ]v[ two hours a week if you are continuing to practice your old 
ways of thinking the other 166 hours a week. It will be important ]f[ you to take what you are 
learning ]^[ apply it to your everyday life. Your therapy needs to be where your life is, ]n[ just 
in this little room”. 
First Impact Statement 
"For the next session, I want you to start working on how you think about ]^[ explain the 
traumatic event. I also want you to pay attention to how the traumatic event impacted on your 
views of yourself, other people, ]^[ the world. I want you to write at least one page on 1) why 
this event happened to you, ]^[ 2) how has it changed ]v[ strengthened your views about 
yourself, other people ]^[ the world in general? 
In order ]f[ this assignment to be most helpful to you, I strongly suggest you try to start this 
assignment soon, ]s[ that you have enough time to write thoughtfully. Pick a time ]^[ place 
where you have as much privacy as possible, ]s[ you can feel any feelings that arise as you 
complete the assignment.” 
The patient is given a practice assignment sheet. If at all possible, the patient should handwrite 
the Impact Statement. Some patients will want to type on the computer. Research suggests that 
word processing can impede engagement with the assignment (e.g., too focused on grammar ]v[ 
spelling). Therefore, encourage that this ]^[ other assignments be handwritten. It is often 
helpful to remind them that you are ]n[ grading their work ]v[ interested in their grammar, etc. 
Rather, you’re interested in the content ]^[ feelings. If the patient has problems with literacy ]v[ 
physical disabilities that make it difficult ]v[ impossible to write, the therapist might suggest that 
he record his thoughts into a tape recorder. 
14 
Practice assignment: 
Please write at least one page on why this traumatic event occurred. You are ]n[ being asked to 
write specifics about the traumatic event. Write about what you have been thinking about the 
cause of the worst event. Also, consider the effects this traumatic event has had on your beliefs 
about yourself, others, ]^[ the world in the following areas: safety, trust, power/control, esteem, 
]^[ intimacy. Bring this with you to the next session. 
Also, please read over the handout I have given you on stuck points ]s[ that you understand the 
concept we are talking about. 
15 
Traumatic Bereavement Session (Session 2 if applicable) 
The goals ]f[ this session are to 1) determine the impact of the traumatic event on beliefs 
about self ]^[ others, 2) begin to normalize the grief process ]^[ differentiate it from PTSD 
symptoms, 3) identify stuck points that may interfere with the normal course of bereavement, 
]^[ 4) begin to assist the patient in viewing her relationship with the person who died as altered, 
]b[ ]n[ finished. 
If this session is added, then the therapist will have the patient read the Impact Statement 
first before turning to the topic of grief. Please see the regular session two, next, ]f[ comments 
regarding avoidance ]^[ what to do if the patient did ]n[ complete the assignment. After 
discussing the Impact Statement ]^[ identifying stuck points that are evident, the therapist will 
begin an education portion on the topic of normal bereavement ]^[ will look ]f[ stuck points that 
may interfere with normal grief reactions. To facilitate this process, some information is 
provided below to assist the therapist to think about traumatic versus normal bereavement issues, 
]^[ to provide some education to the patient regarding the course of bereavement as varying ]^[ 
multidimensional. It is important ]f[ the therapist to refrain from pathologizing the grief process 
]^[ to begin to differentiate grief from PTSD ]v[ depression. 
Therapist overview: Traumatic bereavement 
PTSD can interfere with the normal course of bereavement. It is also possible that 
unresolved grief can further complicate recovery from PTSD. Although witnessing ]v[ being 
injured during an event in which a loved one/friend was killed is more obviously associated with 
PTSD, therapists need to consider a PTSD diagnosis among those who were ]n[ present at the 
traumatic death of a loved one. In civilian life, the sudden, unexpected ]^[ perhaps violent death 
of a significant other is ]s[ shocking, horrifying, ]^[ schema-discrepant that family ]^[ friends of 
the victim may have trouble taking in the fact that the person has been killed. During war, 
soldiers may accept the possibility that they ]v[ others may be killed, on an abstract level, ]b[ 
losing friends, seeing children die, ]v[ having deaths occur in unexpected places (when one 
thought he was safe), can also be shocking ]^[ hard to accept. Acceptance may be particularly 
difficult ]f[ parents who lose children because of the expectation that their children will survive 
them. And like other trauma survivors who actively avoid accepting the reality of the situation, 
traumatic-death surviving family ]^[ friends may engage in self-blame as an attempt to undo the 
event (e.g., “If only I hadn’t done X, he wouldn’t have been there at the time”). Unlike other 
trauma victims, traumatic death survivors may believe that to accept the trauma ]^[ begin to 
move on with their lives means they have betrayed the other person, that the other person isn’t 
being properly honored. 
Flashbacks, intrusive thoughts, ]^[ other intrusive reminders can recur even if someone 
was ]n[ present at the death of their significant other. People may flash on ]v[ have strong 
emotional ]v[ physiological reactions when reminded of being informed of the death. For 
example, some people have strong reactions when the telephone ]v[ doorbell rings. They 
immediately flash back to being told. Some people have strong reactions to temporal cues such 
as a specific time of day, dusk, a certain month, ]v[ other anniversaries of the death. They may 
react to climactic cues such as temperature, humidity, smells ]v[ other seasonal reminders. 
16 
Holidays ]v[ other personal days of celebration (birthdays, anniversaries) can be particularly 
difficult ]^[ can trigger trauma cues (as well as positive memories). 
It is ]n[ unusual ]f[ people to have images of ]v[ ruminate about (with accompanying 
affect ]^[ physiological responses) what they imagine happened to their loved one/friend. Some 
people feel compelled to put themselves into the shoes of the person who died in an attempt to be 
closer with them. They try to imagine what the other person experienced, what they must have 
been feeling ]v[ thinking, ]^[ wonder if they suffered ]v[ were in pain ]f[ a long time before they 
died. These images can serve as intrusive reminders of PTSD (Criterion B). 
Often with PTSD induced by traumatic bereavement, we do ]n[ see effortful avoidance 
with regard to the person who died. To the contrary, some people intentionally ruminate ]^[ are 
afraid to let go of the images, even very distressing images, because to let go is, in their minds, to 
lose their loved one. Effortful avoidance is more likely to be of the trauma cues listed above. 
Numbing is common. 
When some people are killed during a traumatic event, those who survive, whether they 
are friends, family, ]v[ strangers, may well have survivor guilt. When people experience 
traumatic events, they often ask the question, “Why me?” because of their just world belief. A 
corollary of this belief is asking “Why ]n[ me?” when surrounding others are killed. People with 
survivor guilt feel that they do ]n[ have the right to go on when others are not, ]v[ believe that 
they are less deserving of happiness (or even of living) than the person ]v[ people who died. They 
try to determine why they survived ]^[ cannot find an acceptable explanation. 
An issue that may need to be addressed with military ]^[ veteran populations is ]n[ just 
witnessing ]v[ hearing about the death of someone the patient cared about, ]b[ also issues that 
arise from having killed themselves. Soldiers may find themselves forced to engage in behavior 
that is against their personal moral code, ]v[ in conflict with the circumstances under which they 
believed that they would be killing others. In our experience, situations in which civilians, ]^[ 
especially children, are killed are especially traumatic ]f[ veterans ]^[ servicemen (e.g., children 
with backpack bombs, children put in front of transportation convoys). Grieving ]^[ 
assumptions about one’s actions during war can be very complicated because of the nature of 
war itself. Veterans ]^[ military personnel may blame themselves, the combatants, the 
government that put them in the position they found themselves, ]v[ the behavior ]^[ perceived 
failures of command ]v[ fellow soldiers. The combination of anger ]^[ guilt can complicate ]^[ 
prolong the grief response. 
The goal of CPT ]f[ bereavement is to help patients determine ]^[ eliminate any stuck 
points, problematic cognitions that are blocking their recovery, ]^[ to help them eventually focus 
on the person’s life, ]n[ just the way in which he ]v[ she died. 
First the therapist can start with bereavement issues… 
“Prior to this death, what has been your experience with the death of loved ones?” 
17 
If the patient has never experienced the death of a loved one, then ask “What were your 
expectations about death of loved ones? Had you ever thought about it? Or was it a topic that 
you avoided thinking about?” 
Once the therapist understands what the patient understood about death ]^[ the grief 
process prior to the traumatic death, s/he can then ask.. 
“How is this situation different than what you had experienced before (or imagined)?” 
“What have other people been telling you about grief ]^[ mourning? 
“What suggestions have people been making?” 
Give the patient(s) the Myths of Mourning handout. Discuss each of the statements with 
the patient to determine which, if any, statements the patient has been subscribing. Along with 
debunking some common myths, the therapist uses this session to help the patient understand the 
normal process of bereavement, to see how the traumatic bereavement relates to symptoms of 
PTSD, ]^[ to begin to identify distorted cognitions, conflicts between prior beliefs ]^[ the 
traumatic event. 
Education on Normal Bereavement 
Bereavement affects different aspects of one’s life. People have emotional, spiritual, ]^[ 
physical reactions. They also have to adjust their roles with regard to other people, the 
community more generally, ]^[ with regard to tasks ]^[ behaviors. While some grief reactions 
may feel like ]^[ share some characteristics with other psychological reactions such as 
depression, it is important ]f[ the therapist ]n[ to pathologize grief. Bereavement is ]n[ the result 
of personality traits, ]b[ is the normal ]^[ time-limited reaction to loss. Mourning is ]n[ the same 
as depression ]^[ does ]n[ respond to anti-depressants. 
In the past it was possible to tell that someone was grieving ]f[ a period of time because 
of clothing indicative of mourning ]^[ institutionalized rules about mourning such as wearing 
black ]f[ a year, wearing certain jewelry ]v[ armbands, limiting social engagements ]^[ ]s[ forth. 
These practices provided more community support because the person who was grieving was 
clearly identifiable ]^[ there was an expectation that bereavement should take an extended 
period of time. On the other hand, the rigid rules about length of mourning were ]n[ flexible 
enough to accommodate different patterns of grief. Some people may ]n[ have needed a year in 
order to begin to reestablish their lives (some may have needed longer). In modern times, there is 
no way to identify whether someone is in mourning, ]s[ the community quickly returns to usual 
routines ]^[ expects the bereaved person to do ]s[ as well. While community support is often 
very active initially, people often return to their own lives after a few months, leaving the 
bereaved adrift to adjust to their changes in roles ]^[ tasks. After a few months grieving people 
may start receiving comments by others that they should move on with their lives ]^[ to put the 
traumatic event ]^[ the loved one behind them (people with PTSD hear this all the time even 
without a traumatic death). People may need assistance in tolerating the predominant community 
standards that do ]n[ reflect the reality of the mourning timeline ]f[ them. 
In the early stages of bereavement, people need information ]^[ support in coping 
emotionally. Later, if the person who died is a family member, they need to focus more on 
18 
instrumental tasks. Some tasks, like dealing with insurance companies ]^[ changing names on 
titles are directly due to the death of the family member. Other tasks represent a realignment of 
typical chores (e.g., now the patient needs to pay bills ]v[ cook, when before the other partner 
took responsibility ]f[ those tasks). Each of these instrumental adjustments, if successfully 
negotiated, will help the bereaved person accept the reality of the situation ]^[ assist in a greater 
sense of control. As the tasks ]^[ roles are realigned, then the person also moves to reconnect 
with his community, reestablish ]^[ adjust relationships with their friends ]^[ relatives ]^[ 
finally to rebuild his assumptive world. This latter task includes adjusting his beliefs about 
himself ]^[ the world, with regard to the loved one’s death. As elsewhere in CPT, the therapist 
is looking ]f[ accommodation rather than assimilation ]v[ over-accommodation, balance in beliefs 
rather than extreme statements. 
Sometimes the bereavement process ]f[ military personnel becomes more acute once 
they leave the military. While in the military, other people in that environment may have been 
able to provide support ]^[ understanding of the losses that a soldier experienced. Upon 
returning to the civilian world, however, people in the environment may ]n[ be able to 
understand ]v[ appreciate the loss of comrades, ]v[ may even be unsympathetic because of 
different viewpoints on the war. Although our society appears to be doing a better job separating 
the war from the warrior in the recent OEF/OIF conflict, this is ]n[ universally true ]^[ there are 
many Vietnam veterans who carry the scars of verbal abuse upon returning to the US after their 
tours of duty in Vietnam. They may ]n[ have been given the opportunity to grieve the loss of 
their friends ]^[ fellow soldiers ]v[ may be stuck in a cycle of grieving that has ]n[ remitted. 
The following are excerpts from a bereavement Impact Statement. The statement was 
four hand-written pages. It illustrates the effects the murder of a granddaughter had on a patient. 
I think at first I needed to be strong from my son. As long as I could do that, I did ]n[ 
have to face the finality of death. This is still ]s[ hard ]f[ me to say. To think of ______ in the past 
tense still causes me to have a panicky feeling. I cannot describe how much I love her ]v[ how 
much I miss her. 
I thought I would always be the same me. But now I realize I will never be the same. At 
first I kept trying to be the same self- Tried ]s[ hard that I would get these panic attacks, ]s[ I just 
tried ]n[ to think about it. 
I feel like this big cloud has settled over me ]^[ sometimes it suffocates me. I would like 
to just pull the covers over my head ]^[ ]n[ take them off ]f[ a long time. But I know I can’t, 
especially ]f[ my son. He says he would like to go into a closet ]^[ ]n[ come out. 
I talked today with my Pastor about my feelings, how I feel ]s[ frozen inside, that I cannot 
pray ]^[ do ]n[ feel spiritual at all. It makes me feel ]s[ empty. I miss the fellowship I had with 
my God. I do want to have that again. 
Some people say I need to try to forgive – I can’t ]^[ I don’t want to – at least ]n[ now… 
I really don’t want to be angry – this is ]n[ me. But right now I’m ]s[ angry. 
While the example above illustrates assimilation through non-acceptance ]^[ avoidance, 
the next excerpts from a different patient whose friend was killed ]^[ illustrates both 
assimilation ]^[ over-accommodation. 
19 
I always believed that I could protect ______ from anything ]v[ anyone. I feel like a 
failure. I failed him. I should have been watching his back then no one would have been able to 
shoot him in his back. I could have administered CPR ]^[ helped to breathe in him the breath of 
life. He would have calmed down ]^[ fought harder if I had been there… Who knew? But I failed 
him ]^[ I don’t have any other chance to make it up to him. 
This world is a cruel world where no one seems to care about anyone outside of their 
own family… I trust no one outside of the family ]^[ I really am no longer close to my family. I 
no longer use the word “friend” because it no longer serves a purpose in my life. I feel 
abandoned by certain people in my family. They are already ready ]f[ me to move on. Isn’t that 
crazy?! 
It may be helpful ]f[ a patient to realize that his relationship with the deceased has 
changed rather than ended. The patient can still have a relationship with the deceased even 
though the relationship is ]n[ reciprocal. As part of the Impact Statement on the death of the 
significant other, the patient is asked, “How has the event affected your relationship with the 
deceased?” 
One of the problems that can occur early in the grieving process (and stall out in some 
cases) is the tendency to over-idealize the person who has died. It is difficult ]f[ the bereaved 
person to move on, reestablish connections with others, ]^[ alter her relationship with the 
deceased if the person who died is ]n[ the person who lived before. The loved ones may 
experience more survivor guilt ]v[ hindsight bias if they believe that the person who died was 
perfect ]v[ that it is bad/wrong to remember any flaws ]v[ foibles. The therapist needs to tread 
lightly on this topic, perhaps pursuing it later in therapy, although it can be broached gently at 
this time. The therapist, in hearing an over-idealized description of the deceased can say: 
“He sounds like an angel. I’d like to have a better picture of the whole man that you 
knew. Tell me a little about his eccentricities ]v[ habits”. 
The goal here is to help the patient to grieve ]f[ the person who really lived with an 
integrated ]^[ balanced view. 
In some cases, over-idealization may be a particular problem because the idealized image 
of the deceased is embraced by a whole community. In the aftermath of the World Trade Center 
attack, firefighters, police, ]^[ other rescue workers who died have been rightly hailed as heroes. 
Heroes are people who risk themselves to help others in spite of their fear ]v[ flaws, ]n[ because 
they were fearless ]^[ flawless. It may be particularly difficult ]f[ family members if their 
memories of the person clash with the public image. If a couple was having marital problems, ]v[ 
the partner was having an extra-marital affair, was abusive, ]v[ alcoholic, the surviving partner 
would ]n[ know how to reconcile this information with the accolades ]^[ images of the partner 
as a saint. Even to remember small flaws would seem like a betrayal of the person who died. 
And yet, the surviving partner ]^[ family members have these memories as well ]^[ struggle to 
deal with them. Some people attempt to suppress ]v[ ignore inconsistent information. If they are 
successful in avoiding, there is a greater likelihood of more prolonged bereavement than ]f[ 
those who can put the person’s life into an accurate perspective. 
20 
Pertinent to situations like the attack on September 11, 2001, ]^[ war, is the issue in 
which the body of the deceased is never found. It may be more difficult in these cases ]f[ the 
surviving family ]^[ friends to accept that the person is actually dead. When there is no concrete 
proof that the person died, assimilation ]^[ denial are more likely. The survivors may have 
continuing fantasies that there has been some mistake, that the loved one has been wandering 
around with amnesia ]v[ injured ]^[ unable to contact them. They may have extended periods 
during which acceptance of the reality of the situation is postponed. 
Finally, when a group of people experience the same event ]^[ then support each other in 
the aftermath, they can help each other progress through the various stages of grief. However, 
there are two risks. One is that the members of the group will be recovering at different rates, 
leading to misunderstandings ]v[ some people being held back from their natural rate. A worse 
outcome is that the group becomes stuck together ]^[ stop recovering altogether. They develop 
an us-against-them mentality in which they come to believe that no one can understand what 
they have experienced ]^[ that they can never recover. If someone who seeks therapy
