Introduction to Cognitive Processing Therapy 
Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT) is a 12%%dsh%%session therapy that has been found effective 
]f[ both PTSD ]^[ other corollary symptoms following traumatic events (Monson et al%%lst%% 2006%%scn%%

rape victims originally%%lst%% we have used the therapy successfully with a range of other traumatic 
events%%lst%% including military%%dsh%%related traumas%%per%%]$~ ~$[This revision of the manual is in response to requests 
]f[ a treatment manual that focuses exclusively on military trauma%%per%%]$~ ~$[The manual has been 
updated to reflect changes in the therapy over time%%lst%% particularly with an increase in the amount of 
practice that is assigned ]^[ with some of the handouts%%per%%]$~ ~$[It also includes suggestions from almost 
two decades of clinical experience with the therapy%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Also included in this manual is a module ]f[ traumatic bereavement%%per%%]$~ ~$[This module is ]n[ 
included as one of the 12 sessions ]b[ could be added to the therapy%%per%%]$~ ~$[We recommend that the 
session be added early in therapy%%lst%% perhaps as the second session along with the educational 
component on posttraumatic stress disorder%%per%%]$~ ~$[Although we expect PTSD to remit as a result of 
treatment%%lst%% we do ]n[ necessarily expect bereavement to remit%%per%%]$~ ~$[Grief is a normal reaction to loss 
]^[ is ]n[ a disorder%%per%%]$~ ~$[Bereavement may have a long ]^[ varied course%%per%%]$~ ~$[The goal of dealing with 
grief issues within CPT is ]n[ to shorten the natural course of adjustment%%lst%% ]b[ to remove blocks 
]^[ barriers (distorted cognitions%%lst%% assumptions%%lst%% expectations) that are interfering with normal 
bereavement%%per%%]$~ ~$[Therefore%%lst%% the focus is on normal grief%%lst%% myths about bereavement%%lst%% ]^[ stuck 
points that therapists may need to focus on in this domain%%per%%]$~ ~$[If the bereavement session is added to 
CPT%%lst%% then the assignment to write an impact statement would be delayed one session (see 
Session 1) ]f[ those who have PTSD due to a traumatic death%%per%%]$~ ~$[Another possibility is to have the 
patients write two impact statements ]f[ those who both lost a loved one ]^[ have PTSD related
