There are many challenges to transform the power grid into a Digital Grid%%per%%]$~ ~$[The primary ones are listed as follows%%cln%% 
1%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Low marginal costs coupled with high initial capital costs are characteristic of traditional power generation%%per%%]$~ ~$[Today 
the ratio between running cost ]^[ capital cost is falling rapidly with the introduction of renewable generation%%lst%% along 
with flexibility of resources such as storage ]^[ demand response%%per%%]$~ ~$[Standard economic theory predicts that price of

~$[This trend ]^[ price volatility will discourage capital investment%%lst%% which is why FERC ]^[ local authorities are
