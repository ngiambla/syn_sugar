M%%per%%]$~ ~$[MYRIEL 
In 1815%%lst%% M%%per%%]$~ ~$[Charles%%dsh%%Francois%%dsh%%Bienvenu Myriel was Bishop of D%%dsh%%%%dsh%%%%dsh%%%%dsh%% 
He was an old man of about seventy%%dsh%%five years of age%%scn%% he had occupied 
the see of D%%dsh%%%%dsh%%%%dsh%%%%dsh%% since 1806%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Although this detail has no connection whatever with the real 
substance of what we are about to relate%%lst%% it will ]n[ be superfluous%%lst%% 
if merely ]f[ the sake of exactness in all points%%lst%% to mention here 
the various rumors ]^[ remarks which had been in circulation about him 
from the very moment when he arrived in the diocese%%per%%]$~ ~$[True ]v[ false%%lst%% 
that which is said of men often occupies as important a place in 
their lives%%lst%% ]^[ above all in their destinies%%lst%% as that which they do%%per%%]$~ 
~$[M%%per%%]$~ ~$[Myriel was the son of a councillor of the Parliament of Aix%%scn%% 
hence he belonged to the nobility of the bar%%per%%]$~ ~$[It was said that 
his father%%lst%% destining him to be the heir of his own post%%lst%% had married 
him at a very early age%%lst%% eighteen ]v[ twenty%%lst%% in accordance with a 
custom which is rather widely prevalent in parliamentary families%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In spite of this marriage%%lst%% however%%lst%% it was said that Charles Myriel 
created a great deal of talk%%per%%]$~ ~$[He was well formed%%lst%% though rather short 
in stature%%lst%% elegant%%lst%% graceful%%lst%% intelligent%%scn%% the whole of the first 
portion of his life had been devoted to the world ]^[ to gallantry%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The Revolution came%%scn%% events succeeded each other with precipitation%%scn%% 
the parliamentary families%%lst%% decimated%%lst%% pursued%%lst%% hunted down%%lst%% 
were dispersed%%per%%]$~ ~$[M%%per%%]$~ ~$[Charles Myriel emigrated to Italy at the very 
beginning of the Revolution%%per%%]$~ ~$[There his wife died of a malady of 
the chest%%lst%% from which she had long suffered%%per%%]$~ ~$[He had no children%%per%%]$~ 
~$[What took place next in the fate of M%%per%%]$~ ~$[Myriel%%qsn%%]$~ ~$[The ruin of the French 
society of the olden days%%lst%% the fall of his own family%%lst%% the tragic 
spectacles of %%sqt%%93%%lst%% which were%%lst%% perhaps%%lst%% even more alarming to the 
emigrants who viewed them from a distance%%lst%% with the magnifying powers 
of terror,%%dsh%%%%dsh%%did these cause the ideas of renunciation ]^[ solitude 
to germinate in him%%qsn%%]$~ ~$[Was he%%lst%% in the midst of these distractions%%lst%% 
these affections which absorbed his life%%lst%% suddenly smitten with one 
of those mysterious ]^[ terrible blows which sometimes overwhelm%%lst%% 
by striking to his heart%%lst%% a man whom public catastrophes would 
]n[ shake%%lst%% by striking at his existence ]^[ his fortune%%qsn%%]$~ ~$[No one 
could have told%%cln%% all that was known was%%lst%% that when he returned 
from Italy he was a priest%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In 1804%%lst%% M%%per%%]$~ ~$[Myriel was the Cure of B%%dsh%%%%dsh%%%%dsh%%%%dsh%% [Brignolles]%%per%%]$~ ~$[He was already 
advanced in years%%lst%% ]^[ lived in a very retired manner%%per%%]$~ 
~$[About the epoch of the coronation%%lst%% some petty affair connected 
with his curacy%%dsh%%%%dsh%%just what%%lst%% is ]n[ precisely known%%dsh%%%%dsh%%took him 
to Paris%%per%%]$~ ~$[Among other powerful persons to whom he went to solicit 
aid ]f[ his parishioners was M%%per%% le Cardinal Fesch%%per%%]$~ ~$[One day%%lst%% 
when the Emperor had come to visit his uncle%%lst%% the worthy Cure%%lst%% 
who was waiting in the anteroom%%lst%% found himself present when His 
Majesty passed%%per%%]$~ ~$[Napoleon%%lst%% on finding himself observed with a certain 
curiosity by this old man%%lst%% turned round ]^[ said abruptly:%%dsh%%%%dsh%%

at a great man%%per%%]$~ ~$[Each of us can profit by it%%per%%%%dqt%% 
That very evening%%lst%% the Emperor asked the Cardinal the name of the Cure%%lst%% 
]^[ some time afterwards M%%per%%]$~ ~$[Myriel was utterly astonished to learn 
that he had been appointed Bishop of D%%dsh%%%%dsh%%%%dsh%%%%dsh%% 
What truth was there%%lst%% after all%%lst%% in the stories which were invented 
as to the early portion of M%%per%%]$~ ~$[Myriel%%sqt%%s life%%qsn%%]$~ ~$[No one knew%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Very few families had been acquainted with the Myriel family before

~$[M%%per%%]$~ ~$[Myriel had to undergo the fate of every newcomer in a little town%%lst%%

~$[He was obliged to undergo it although he was a bishop%%lst%% ]^[ because he 
was a bishop%%per%%]$~ ~$[But after all%%lst%% the rumors with which his name was

~$[However that may be%%lst%% after nine years of episcopal power ]^[ of

~$[M%%per%%]$~ ~$[Myriel had arrived at D%%dsh%%%%dsh%%%%dsh%%%%dsh%% accompanied by an elderly spinster%%lst%%

~$[Mademoiselle Baptistine was a long%%lst%% pale%%lst%% thin%%lst%% gentle creature%%scn%%

seems that a woman must needs be a mother in order to be venerable%%per%%]$~ 
~$[She had never been pretty%%scn%% her whole life%%lst%% which had been nothing

~$[What had been leanness in her youth had become transparency in

~$[She was a soul rather than a virgin%%per%%]$~ ~$[Her person seemed made

CHAPTER I 
THE WATER QUESTION AT MONTFERMEIL 
Montfermeil is situated between Livry ]^[ Chelles%%lst%% on the southern edge 
of that lofty table%%dsh%%land which separates the Ourcq from the Marne%%per%%]$~ 
~$[At the present day it is a tolerably large town%%lst%% ornamented all the year 
through with plaster villas%%lst%% ]^[ on Sundays with beaming bourgeois%%per%%]$~ 
~$[In 1823 there were at Montfermeil neither ]s[ many white houses nor 
]s[ many well%%dsh%%satisfied citizens%%cln%% it was only a village in the forest%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Some pleasure%%dsh%%houses of the last century were to be met with there%%lst%% 
to be sure%%lst%% which were recognizable by their grand air%%lst%% their balconies 
in twisted iron%%lst%% ]^[ their long windows%%lst%% whose tiny panes cast all 
sorts of varying shades of green on the white of the closed shutters%%scn%% 
]b[ Montfermeil was none the less a village%%per%%]$~ ~$[Retired cloth%%dsh%%merchants 
]^[ rusticating attorneys had ]n[ discovered it as yet%%scn%% it was a 
peaceful ]^[ charming place%%lst%% which was ]n[ on the road to anywhere%%cln%% 
there people lived%%lst%% ]^[ cheaply%%lst%% that peasant rustic life which is 
]s[ bounteous ]^[ ]s[ easy%%scn%% only%%lst%% water was rare there%%lst%% on account 
of the elevation of the plateau%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It was necessary to fetch it from a considerable distance%%scn%% 
the end of the village towards Gagny drew its water from the 
magnificent ponds which exist in the woods there%%per%%]$~ ~$[The other end%%lst%% 
which surrounds the church ]^[ which lies in the direction of Chelles%%lst%% 
found drinking%%dsh%%water only at a little spring half%%dsh%%way down the slope%%lst%% 
near the road to Chelles%%lst%% about a quarter of an hour from Montfermeil%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Thus each household found it hard work to keep supplied with water%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The large houses%%lst%% the aristocracy%%lst%% of which the Thenardier tavern 
formed a part%%lst%% paid half a farthing a bucketful to a man who made a 
business of it%%lst%% ]^[ who earned about eight sous a day in his enterprise 
of supplying Montfermeil with water%%scn%% ]b[ this good man only worked 
until seven o%%sqt%%clock in the evening in summer%%lst%% ]^[ five in winter%%scn%% 
]^[ night once come ]^[ the shutters on the ground floor once closed%%lst%% 
he who had no water to drink went to fetch it ]f[ himself ]v[ did 
without it%%per%%]$~ 
~$[This constituted the terror of the poor creature whom the reader 
has probably ]n[ forgotten,%%dsh%%%%dsh%%little Cosette%%per%%]$~ ~$[It will be remembered 
that Cosette was useful to the Thenardiers in two ways%%cln%% 
they made the mother pay them%%lst%% ]^[ they made the child serve them%%per%%]$~ 
~$[So when the mother ceased to pay altogether%%lst%% the reason ]f[ which we 
have read in preceding chapters%%lst%% the Thenardiers kept Cosette%%per%%]$~ 
~$[She took the place of a servant in their house%%per%%]$~ ~$[In this capacity she 
it was who ran to fetch water when it was required%%per%%]$~ ~$[So the child%%lst%% 
who was greatly terrified at the idea of going to the spring at night%%lst%% 
took great care that water should never be lacking in the house%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Christmas of the year 1823 was particularly brilliant at Montfermeil%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The beginning of the winter had been mild%%scn%% there had been neither snow 
nor frost up to that time%%per%%]$~ ~$[Some mountebanks from Paris had obtained 
permission of the mayor to erect their booths in the principal street 
of the village%%lst%% ]^[ a band of itinerant merchants%%lst%% under protection 
of the same tolerance%%lst%% had constructed their stalls on the Church Square%%lst%% 
]^[ even extended them into Boulanger Alley%%lst%% where%%lst%% as the reader 
will perhaps remember%%lst%% the Thenardiers%%sqt%% hostelry was situated%%per%%]$~ 
~$[These people filled the inns ]^[ drinking%%dsh%%shops%%lst%% ]^[ communicated 
to that tranquil little district a noisy ]^[ joyous life%%per%%]$~ ~$[In order 
to play the part of a faithful historian%%lst%% we ought even to add that%%lst%% 
among the curiosities displayed in the square%%lst%% there was a menagerie%%lst%% 
in which frightful clowns%%lst%% clad in rags ]^[ coming no one knew whence%%lst%% 
exhibited to the peasants of Montfermeil in 1823 one of those 
horrible Brazilian vultures%%lst%% such as our Royal Museum did ]n[ 
possess until 1845%%lst%% ]^[ which have a tricolored cockade ]f[ an eye%%per%%]$~ 
~$[I believe that naturalists call this bird Caracara Polyborus%%scn%% 
it belongs to the order of the Apicides%%lst%% ]^[ to the family of 
the vultures%%per%%]$~ ~$[Some good old Bonapartist soldiers%%lst%% who had retired 
to the village%%lst%% went to see this creature with great devotion%%per%%]$~ 
~$[The mountebanks gave out that the tricolored cockade was a unique 
phenomenon made by God expressly ]f[ their menagerie%%per%%]$~ 
~$[On Christmas eve itself%%lst%% a number of men%%lst%% carters%%lst%% ]^[ peddlers%%lst%% 
were seated at table%%lst%% drinking ]^[ smoking around four ]v[ five 
candles in the public room of Thenardier%%sqt%%s hostelry%%per%%]$~ ~$[This room 
resembled all drinking%%dsh%%shop rooms,%%dsh%%%%dsh%%tables%%lst%% pewter jugs%%lst%% bottles%%lst%%

~$[The date of the year 1823 was indicated%%lst%% nevertheless%%lst%% by two 
objects which were then fashionable in the bourgeois class%%cln%% to wit%%lst%%

attending to the supper%%lst%% which was roasting in front of a clear fire%%scn%%

~$[Besides political conversations which had ]f[ their principal subjects

THE BEGINNING OF AN ENIGMA 
Jean Valjean found himself in a sort of garden which was very vast

where could be seen a very large%%lst%% solitary tree%%lst%% then several fruit%%dsh%%trees%%lst%%

~$[Here ]^[ there stood stone benches which seemed black with moss%%per%%]$~

~$[Jean Valjean had beside him the building whose roof had served him

~$[The building was a sort of ruin%%lst%% where dismantled chambers were

~$[The large building of the Rue Droit%%dsh%%Mur%%lst%% which had a wing on the Rue

~$[All the windows were grated%%per%%]$~ ~$[Not a gleam of light was visible

THE AGONY OF DEATH AFTER THE AGONY OF LIFE 
A peculiarity of this species of war is%%lst%% that the attack of the
