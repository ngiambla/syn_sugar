~$[For example%%lst%% one letter writer%%lst%% commenting on my Dec%%per%% 12 
Counterpoint%%lst%% %%dqt%%Gun Control Is Constitutional,%%dqt%% felt compelled 
to instruct me that the word militia means %%dqt%%the whole

~$[That same correspondent accused me of calling ]f[ %%dqt%%removal

although the Second Amendment has nothing to do with private 
uses of arms%%lst%% there is an unenumerated ]b[ undeniable right

~$[We have many rights ]n[ enumerated in the Constitution%%lst%%

letter writer who also knows something about the

~$[All the letters missed entirely my point about requiring 
gun owners to %%dqt%%sign up%%dqt%% with (not %%dqt%%join%%dqt%%) the National Guard%%per%%]$~ 
~$[I likened it to the current law requiring 18%%dsh%%year%%dsh%%old men to

owners to register with the National Guard would provide the

~$[But my main point was to show how far Congress can go in

~$[Another letter writer thinks I have confused the issue by
