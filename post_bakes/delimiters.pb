Tom Bearden (1991) described a Vacuum Triode developed by Sweet%%per%%]$~ ~$[I have 
seen Tom%%sqt%%s videotape of this device in operation%%lst%% when it was operating%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Tom considers the highly nonlinear nucleus of the atom as a pumped phase 
conjugate mirror (PPCM)%%per%%]$~ ~$[He likens this effect to a triode tube since 
the amplified phase conjugate replica of the signal wave is much like 
the amplified output of a triode%%lst%% ]^[ the input to a PPCM is much like a 
triode%%sqt%%s grid signal input%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Sweet has developed working devices based upon this vacuum triode 
concept utilizing paired barium ferrite magnets ]^[ resonant circuits%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It should be noted that in order for the device to work%%lst%% the magnets 
were preconditioned by an undisclosed process%%per%%]$~ ~$[Devices have been 
reported ]^[ demonstrated to reliable witness that have produced 
continuous 6%%lst%% 500%%lst%% ]^[ 5,000 Watts output from a nine volt DC battery%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Through Tom%%sqt%%s theoretical suggestions%%lst%% the circuit was modified to test 
possible antigravity effects%%per%%]$~ ~$[The test results performed by Sweet alone 
indicated a 90% weight reduction of the device itself%%lst%% from 6 pounds to 
about 20 ounces on a spring scale%%lst%% when the external load was increased

PART I 
To give you some background on myself%%lst%% I have been interested in the 
energy situation since I can remember%%per%%]$~ ~$[I have built all kinds of 
devices%%lst%% solar energy panels%%lst%% windmills%%lst%% photovoltaic arrays%%lst%% flywheel

background I am an accomplished tool ]^[ diemaker%%lst%% moldmaker%%lst%% been 
involved in Design Engineering for the past 12 years%%lst%% primarily in the 
automation area%%per%%]$~ 
~$[My first real involvement with other people in this alternate energy 
area was at the Toronto Symposium in 1981 where I met George Hathaway as 
well as over 100 other people that believe in the impossible according 
to orthodox science%%per%%]$~ ~$[Since that time I have made myself aware of just 
about everything that is happening in this field%%lst%% ]^[ believe me there 
are some really fantastic things going on%%per%%]$~ ~$[The rediscovery of some of 
the technology that was lost in the past is finally coming to 
realization%%lst%% for instance the Tesla technology%%lst%% the Hubbard device%%lst%% the 
Moray approach to tapping into the free energy supply that we%%sqt%%re sitting 
in without even knowing it%%per%%]$~ 
~$[A friend of mine gave me a real insight possibly without even knowing 
it%%per%%]$~ ~$[He said the problem could only be solved by just considering the 
problem of weighing a glass of water at 500 feet under water%%per%%]$~ ~$[Here you 
are under water with a glass of water%%cln%% how do you weigh it??%%qsn%%]$~ 
~$[The analogy is the same for us%%per%%]$~ ~$[Here we sit in the vastness of the 
cosmos on top of one of the biggest magnets known to us ]^[ we are like 
the glass of water%%per%%]$~ ~$[We are in the vast ocean of energy%%per%%]$~ ~$[Look around us 
]^[ watch just the weather for instance%%lst%% the next thunderstorm%%lst%% think of 
all the electrical potential being wasted%%per%%]$~ ~$[That energy is there%%scn%% it is 
very real%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Tom Bearden%%lst%% one of our upcoming speakers%%lst%% may have illustrated it quite 
well by the bird sitting on top of the wire with 13,000 volts going 
through it%%per%%]$~ ~$[We all know that it could kill him ]b[ it doesn%%sqt%%t%%per%%]$~ ~$[I am 
positive that within this group will be the ways ]^[ means for making 
the energy situation of the future change%%per%%]$~ 
~$[Now to the other side of this coin%%per%%]$~ ~$[Why has not this technology been 
allowed to become established%%qsn%%]$~ ~$[We have to look at the %%sqt%%profit motive%%sqt%% 
involved%%per%%]$~ ~$[If we have free energy%%lst%% how will they charge for it%%qsn%%]$~ ~$[What 
will happen to the billions of dollars that the utilities ]^[ oil 
companies ]^[ the government backing these establishments do if we can 
give the people independence from the chains of having to pay for 
energy%%qsn%%]$~ 
~$[One question that has been uppermost in my mind for the last year has 
been the rhetoric given by our elected representatives about the energy 
situation ]^[ the amount of money given to small researchers who could 
possibly give us a viable approach to becoming energy independent%%per%%]$~ ~$[Who 
gets the government money?%%qsn%%]$~ ~$[Let me get a little audience participation 
in the question%%per%%]$~ ~$[How many of you have all the money you need for 
research in the energy area%%qsn%%]$~ ~$[Everyone who has please stand!!!!%%xcm%%]$~ ~$[Now 
let me mention a few of the names of the companies that get the money%%per%%]$~ 
~$[See if you recognize them%%cln%% Exxon%%lst%% Gulf Oil%%lst%% General Electric%%lst%% 
Westinghouse%%lst%% TRW%%lst%% Exide Storage Battery%%lst%% all manufacturers ]v[ producers 
of fossil fuel products%%per%%]$~ ~$[We need to get away from the fossil fuels for 
the future ]^[ get into something that can indeed give us a future 
because we are rapidly depleting not only our natural resources ]b[ our 
air ]^[ water%%per%%]$~ ~$[All because of burning fossil fuels%%per%%]$~ ~$[We fund our 
universities ]^[ colleges in the most directed of ways%%per%%]$~ ~$[If you want to 
explore the possibilities in some of the more esoteric areas%%lst%% for 
instance the ones you will be hearing about in the next three days%%lst%% 
there is no money for that%%per%%]$~ ~$[WHY??%%qsn%%]$~ ~$[Because of the possibility that we 
might succeed%%per%%]$~ ~$[What would our government do if all the American people 
could go back ]^[ forth to work%%lst%% heat their homes%%lst%% run their businesses 
without paying taxes on gas ]^[ oil%%qsn%%]$~ ~$[Consider the fact that all of the 
gas stations would go out of business ]v[ would have to find other ways 
of making money%%per%%]$~ ~$[Many complimentary businesses would also fold%%per%%]$~ ~$[But 
alas%%lst%% this is America%%per%%]$~ ~$[What are we here for??%%qsn%%]$~ ~$[To perpetuate Big 
Business%%lst%% Big Government%%lst%% ]v[ to advance toward the future%%lst%% not expending 
all of our natural resources ]b[ to save them to make the goods of the 
future%%per%%]$~ ~$[Coal ]^[ oil both can be used for making all kinds of things 
besides fuels%%scn%% the list is endless%%per%%]$~ 
~$[It is my feeling that the technology may be already here ]^[ may have 
been shown to the government%%per%%]$~ ~$[It even may have been introduced to our 
patent office ]^[ turned down%%per%%]$~ ~$[Because as you know%%lst%% there is no such 
thing as a perpetual motion device%%per%%]$~ ~$[And I agree with the premise 
because forever is a long time%%per%%]$~ 
~$[But there are surely some of the devices ]v[ parts thereof that have been

been shelved%%per%%]$~ ~$[Tesla%%sqt%%s transmission device is a classic illustration
