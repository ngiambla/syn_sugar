 In this paper we present a formalization of the centering approach to modeling attentional structure in discourse and use it as the basis for an algorithm to track discourse context and bind pronouns . 
 As described in Grosz et al. 1986 , the process of centering attention on entities in the discourse gives rise to the intersentential transitional states of continuing , retaining and shifting . 
 We propose an extension to these states which handles some additional cases of multiple ambiguous pronouns . 
 The algorithm has been implemented in an HPSG natural language system which serves as the interface to a database query application . 
 In the approach to discourse structure developed in Sidner 1983 and Grosz et al. 1986 , a discourse exhibits both global and local coherence . 
 On this view , a key element of local coherence is centering , a system of rules and constraints that govern the relationship between what the discourse is about and some of the linguistic choices made by the discourse participants , e.g. choice of grammatical function , syntactic structure , and type of referring expression ( proper noun , definite or indefinite description , reflexive or personal pronoun , etc . ) 
 Pronominalization in particular serves to focus attention on what is being talked about ; inappropriate use or failure to use pronouns causes communication to be less fluent . 
 For instance , it takes longer for hearers to process a pronominalized noun phrase that is not in focus than one that is , while it takes longer to process a non-pronominalized noun phrase that is in focus than one that is not Guindon 1985 . 
 The Grosz et al. 1986 centering model is based on the following assumptions . 
 A discourse segment consists of a sequence of utterances  . 
 With each utterance  is associated a list of forward-looking centers ,  , consisting of those discourse entities that are directly realized or realized by linguistic expressions in the utterance . 
 Ranking of an entity on this list corresponds roughly to the likelihood that it will be the primary focus of subsequent discourse ; the first entity on this list is the preferred center ,  . 
  actually centers , or is `` about '' , only one entity at a time , the backward-looking center ,  . 
 The backward center is a confirmation of an entity that has already been introduced into the discourse ; more specifically , it must be realized in the immediately preceding utterance ,  . 
 There are several distinct types of transitions from one utterance to the next . 
 The typology of transitions is based on two factors : whether or not the center of attention , Cb , is the same from  to  , and whether or not this entity coincides with the preferred center of  . 
 Definitions of these transition types appear in figure  . 
 These transitions describe how utterances are linked together in a coherent local segment of discourse . 
 If a speaker has a number of propositions to express , one very simple way to do this coherently is to express all the propositions about a given entity ( continuing ) before introducing a related entity ( retaining ) and then shifting the center to this new entity . 
 See figure  . 
 Retaining may be a way to signal an intention to shift . 
 While we do not claim that speakers really behave in such an orderly fashion , an algorithm that expects this kind of behavior is more successful than those which depend solely on recency or parallelism of grammatical function . 
 The interaction of centering with global focusing mechanisms and with other factors such as intentional structure , semantic selectional restrictions , verb tense and aspect , modality , intonation and pitch accent are topics for further research . 
 Note that these transitions are more specific than focus movement as described in Sidner 1983 . 
 The extension we propose makes them more specific still . 
 Note also that the Cb of Grosz et al. 1986 corresponds roughly to Sidner 's discourse focus and the Cf to her potential foci . 
 The formal system of constraints and rules for centering , as we have interpreted them from Grosz et al. 1986 , are as follows . 
 For each  in  : 
 CONSTRAINTS 
 There is precisely one Cb . 
 Every element of  must be realized in  . 
  is the highest-ranked element of  that is realized in  . 
 RULES 
 If some element of  is realized as a pronoun in  , then so is  . 
 Continuing is preferred over retaining which is preferred over shifting . 
 As is evident in constraint  , ranking of the items on the forward center list , Cf , is crucial . 
 We rank the items in Cf by obliqueness of grammatical relation of the subcategorized functions of the main verb : that is , first the subject , object , and object 2 , followed by other subcategorized functions , and finally , adjuncts . 
 This captures the idea in Grosz et al. 1986 that subjecthood contributes strongly to the priority of an item on the Cf list . 
 We are aware that this ranking usually coincides with surface constituent order in English . 
 It would be of interest to examine data from languages with relatively freer constituent order ( e.g. German ) to determine the influence of constituent order upon centering when the grammatical functions are held constant . 
 In addition , languages that provide an identifiable topic function ( e.g. Japanese ) suggest that topic takes precedence over subject . 
 The part of the HPSG system that uses the centering algorithm for pronoun binding is called the pragmatics processor . 
 It interacts with another module called the semantics processor , which computes representations of intrasentential anaphoric relations , ( among other things ) . 
 The semantics processor has access to information such as the surface syntactic structure of the utterance . 
 It provides the pragmatics processor with representations which include of a set of reference markers . 
 Each reference marker is contraindexed with expressions with which it cannot co-specify . 
 Reference markers also carry information about agreement and grammatical function . 
 Each pronominal reference marker has a unique index from  and is displayed in the figures in the form  , where POLLARD is the semantic representation of the co-specifier . 
 For non-pronominal reference markers the surface string is used as the index . 
 Indices for indefinites are generated from  . 
 The constraints proposed by Grosz et al. 1986 fail in certain examples like the following ( read with pronouns destressed ) : 
 This example is characterized by its multiple ambiguous pronouns and by the fact that the final utterance achieves a shift ( see figure  ) . 
 A shift is inevitable because of constraint 3 , which states that the  must equal the  ( since the  is directly realized by the subject of  , `` Friedman '' ) . 
 However the constraints and rules from Grosz et al. 1986 would fail to make a choice here between the co-specification possibilities for the pronouns in  . 
 Given that the transition is a shift , there seem to be more and less coherent ways to shift . 
 Note that the three items being examined in order to characterize the transition between each pair of anchors are the Cb of  , the Cb of  , and the Cp of  . 
 By Grosz et al. 1986 a shift occurs whenever successive Cb 's are not the same . 
 This definition of shifting does not consider whether the Cb of  and the Cp of  are equal . 
 It seems that the status of the Cp of  should be as important in this case as it is in determining the retaining / chontinuing distinction . 
 Therefore , we propose the following extension which handles some additional cases containing multiple ambiguous pronouns : we have extended rule 2 so that there are two kinds of shifts . 
 A transition for  is ranked more highly if  ; this state we call shifting - 1 and it represents a more coherent way to shift . 
 The preferred ranking is  shifting - 1  ( see figure  ) . 
 This extension enables us to successfully bind the `` she '' in the final utterance of the example in figure  to `` Friedman . '' 
 The appendix illustrates the application of the algorithm to figure  . 
 Kameyama 1986 has proposed another extension to the Grosz et al. 1986 theory - a property-sharing constraint which attempts to enforce a parallellism between entities in successive utterances . 
 She considers two properties : SUBJ and IDENT . 
 With her extension , subject pronouns prefer subject antecedents and non-subject pronouns prefer non-subject antecedents . 
 However , structural parallelism is a consequence of our ordering the Cf list by grammatical function and the preference for continuing over retaining . 
 Furthermore , the constraints suggested in Grosz et al. 1986 succeed in many cases without invoking an independent structural parallelism constraint , due to the distinction between continuing and retaining , which Kameyama fails to consider . 
 Her example which we reproduce in figure  can also be accounted for using the continuing / retaining distinction . 
 The third utterance in this example has two interpretations which are both consistent with the centering rules and constraints . 
 Because of rule 2 , the interpretation in figure  is preferred over the one in figure  . 
 There are three basic phases to this algorithm . 
 First the proposed anchors are constructed , then they are filtered , and finally , they are classified and ranked . 
 The proposed anchors represent all the co-specification relationships available for this utterance . 
 Each step is discussed and illustrated in figure  . 
 It would be possible to classify and rank the proposed anchors before filtering them without any other changes to the algorithm . 
 In fact , using this strategy one could see if the highest ranked proposal passed all the filters , or if the next highest did , etc . 
 The three filters in the filtering phase may be done in parallel . 
 The example we use to illustrate the algorithm is in figure  . 
 The goal of the current algorithm design was conceptual clarity rather than efficiency . 
 The hope is that the structure provided will allow easy addition of further constraints and preferences . 
 It would be simple to change the control structure of the algorithm so that it first proposed all the continuing or retaining anchors and then the shifting ones , thus avoiding a precomputation of all possible anchors . 
 Grosz et al. 1986 states that a realization may contribute more than one entity to the Cf(U) . 
 This is true in cases when a partially specified semantic description is consistent with more than one interpretation . 
 There is no need to enumerate explicitly all the possible interpretations when constructing possible Cf(U)'s , as long as the associated semantic theory allows partially specified interpretations . 
 This also holds for entities not directly realized in an utterance . 
 On our view , after referring to `` a house '' in  , a reference to `` the door '' in  might be gotten via inference from the representation for `` a house '' in  . 
 Thus when the proposed anchors are constructed there is no possibility of having an infinite number of potential Cf 's for an utterance of finite length . 
 Another question is whether the preference ordering of transitions in constraint 3 should always be the same . 
 For some examples , particularly where  contains a single pronoun and  is a retention , some informants seem to have a preference for shifting , whereas the centering algorithm chooses a continuation ( see figure  ) . 
 Many of our informants have no strong preference as to the co-specification of the unstressed `` She '' in  . 
 Speakers can avoid ambiguity by stressing a pronoun with respect to its phonological environment . 
 A computational system for understanding may need to explicitly acknowledge this ambiguity . 
 A computational system for generation would try to plan a retention as a signal of an impending shift , so that after a retention , a shift would be preferred rather than a continuation . 
 Of course the local approach described here does not provide all the necessary information for interpreting pronouns ; constraints are also imposed by world knowledge , pragmatics , semantics and phonology . 
 There are other interesting questions concerning the centering algorithm . 
 How should the centering algorithm interact with an inferencing mechanism ? 
 Should it make choices when there is more than one proposed anchor with the same ranking ? 
 In a database query system , how should answers be incorporated into the discourse model ? 
 How does centering interact with a treatment of definite / indefinite NP 's and quantifiers ? 
 We are exploring ideas for these and other extensions to the centering approach for modeling reference in local discourse .
