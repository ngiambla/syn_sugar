 We describe a method for analysing the temporal structure of a discourse which takes into account the effects of tense , aspect , temporal adverbials and rhetorical structure and which minimises unnecessary ambiguity in the temporal structure . 
 It is part of a discourse grammar implemented in Carpenter 's ALE formalism . 
 The method for building up the temporal structure of the discourse combines constraints and preferences : we use constraints to reduce the number of possible structures , exploiting the HPSG type hierarchy and unification for this purpose ; and we apply preferences to choose between the remaining options using a temporal centering mechanism . 
 We end by recommending that an underspecified representation of the structure using these techniques be used to avoid generating the temporal / rhetorical structure until higher-level information can be used to disambiguate . 
 In this paper we describe a method for analysing the temporal structure of a discourse . 
 This component was implemented as part of a discourse grammar for English . 
 The goals of the temporal component were to yield a detailed representation of the temporal structure of the discourse , taking into account the effect of tense , aspect and temporal expressions while at the same time minimising unnecessary ambiguity in the temporal structure . 
 The method combines a constraint-based approach with an approach based on preferences : we exploit the HPSG type hierarchy and unification to arrive at a temporal structure using constraints placed on that structure by tense , aspect , rhetorical structure and temporal expressions , and we use the temporal centering preferences described by Kameyama et al. 1993 , Poesio 1994 to rate the possibilities for temporal structure and choose the best among them . 
 The starting point for this work was Scha and Polanyi 's discourse grammar Scha and Polanyi 1988 , Pruest et al. 1994 . 
 For the implementation we extended the HPSG grammar Pollard and Sag 1994 which Gerald Penn and Bob Carpenter first encoded in ALE Carpenter 1993 . 
 This paper will focus on our temporal processing algorithm , and in particular on our analysis of narrative progression , rhetorical structure , perfects and temporal expressions . 
 Probably the best known algorithm for tracking narrative progression is that developed by Kamp 1979 , Hinrichs 1981 , and Partee 1984 , which formalises the observation that an event will occur just after a preceding event , while a state will overlap with a preceding event . 
 This algorithm gives the correct results in examples such as the following : 
 In  the event of Mary 's standing is understood to occur just after John enters the room , while in  the state in which Mary is seated is understood to overlap with the event of John 's entering the room . 
 However , if there is a rhetorical relationship between two eventualities such as causation , elaboration or enablement , the temporal defaults can be overridden , as in the following examples : 
 In  there is a causal relationship between Mary 's pushing John and his falling , and the second event is understood to precede the first . 
 In  , the second sentence is an elaboration of the first , and they therefore refer to aspects of the same event rather than to two sequential events . 
 It has been suggested that only world knowledge allows one to detect that the default is being overridden here . 
 For example , Lascarides and Asher 1991 suggest that general knowledge postulates ( in the case of  : that a pushing can cause a falling ) can be invoked to generate the backward movement reading . 
 The problem for practical systems is twofold : we could assume that in the case of narrative the Kamp / Hinrichs / Partee algorithm is the default , but each time the default is applied we would need to check all our available world knowledge to see whether there isn't a world knowledge postulate which might be overriding this assumption . 
 Clearly this would make the processing of text a very expensive operation . 
 An alternative is to assume that the temporal ordering between events in two consecutive sentences can be any of the four possibilities ( just_after , precede , same-event and overlap ) . 
 But then the resulting temporal structures will be highly ambiguous even in small discourses . 
 And sometimes this ambiguity is unwarranted . 
 Consider : 
 Here , it would appear , only one reading is possible , i.e. the one where John gave Mary her slice of pizza just after she stared or started to stare at him . 
 It would be undesirable for the temporal processing mechanism to postulate an ambiguity in this case . 
 Of course , sometimes it is possible to take advantage of certain cue words which either indicate or constrain the rhetorical relation . 
 For example , in  the order of the events is understood to be the reverse of that in  due to the cue word because which signals a causal relationship between the events : 
 As Kehler 1994a points out , if forward movement of time is considered a default with consecutive event sentences , then the use of `` because '' in  should cause a temporal clash -- whereas it is perfectly felicitous . 
 Temporal expressions such as at noon and the previous Thursday can have a similar effect : they too can override the default temporal relations and place constraints on tense  
 In  , for example , the default interpretation would be that John 's being in Detroit overlaps with his being in Boston , but the phrase the previous Thursday overrides this , giving the interpretation that John 's being in Detroit precedes his being in Boston : 
 This suggests that the temporal information given by tense acts as a weaker constraint on temporal structure than the information given by temporal adverbials . 
 The possibilities for rhetorical relations ( e.g. , whether something is narration , or elaboration , or a causal relation ) can be further constrained by aspect . 
 For example , a state can elaborate another state or an event : 
 But an event can only elaborate another event , as in  : 
 For the eventive second sentence of  to be an elaboration of the first sentence , it must occur in a stative form -- for example as a progressive ( i.e. , She was building a dog house ) . 
 Because of considerations like these , our aim in the implementation work was to treat tense , aspect , cue words and rhetorical relations as mutually constraining , with more specific information such as explicit cue words having higher priority than less specific information such as tense . 
 The main advantage of this approach is that it reduces temporal structure ambiguity without having to rely on detailed world knowledge postulates . 
 Table  lists the possible temporal relations between the eventualities described by two consecutive sentences without temporal expressions or cue words , where the first sentence ( S  ) may have any tense and aspect and the second sentence ( S  ) expresses a simple past event . 
 We constrain S  in this way because of lack of space ; additional constraints are given in Hitzeman et al. 1994 . 
 For example , if a simple past eventive sentence follows a simple past eventive sentence the second event can be understood to occur just after the first , to precede the first or to refer to the same event as the first ( an elaboration relation ) , but the two events cannot overlap ; these constraints are weaker , however , than explicit clues such as cue words to rhetorical relations and temporal expressions . 
 When S  expresses a state , it is possible for the temporal relation to hold between the event described by S  and the event or activity most closely preceding S  , i.e. , the temporal focus of S  , here referred to as TF  . 
 However , we haven't solved the problem completely at this point : although tense can provide a further constraint on the temporal structure of such discourses , it can also add a further ambiguity . 
 Consider  : 
 Clearly , the event described by the past perfect sentence must precede the event described by the first , simple past sentence . 
 However , if a third sentence is added , an ambiguity results . 
 Consider the following possible continuations of  : 
 The temporal relation between these continuations and the portion of earlier text they attach to is constrained along the lines sketched before . 
 The problem here is determining which thread in  they continue ;  continues the thread in which Sam rings the bell , but  continues the thread in which Sam loses the key . 
 A further ambiguity is that when the third sentence is past perfect , it may be a continuation of a preceding thread or the start of a new thread itself . 
 Consider : 
 In  the third sentence continues the thread about losing the key ; in  the third starts a new thread . 
 For the problem with multi-sentence discourses , and the `` threads '' that sentences continue , we use an implementation of temporal centering Kameyama et al. 1993, Poesio 1994 . 
 This is a technique similar to the type of centering used for nominal anaphora Sidner 1983, Grosz et al. 1983 . 
 Centering assumes that discourse understanding requires some notion of `` aboutness . 
 '' While nominal centering assumes there is one object that the current discourse is `` about , '' temporal centering assumes that there is one thread that the discourse is currently following , and that , in addition to tense and aspect constraints , there is a preference for a new utterance to continue a thread which has a parallel tense or which is semantically related to it and a preference to continue the current thread rather than switching to another thread . 
 Kameyama et al. 1993 confirmed these preferences when testing their ideas on the Brown corpus . 
 As an example of how the temporal centering preference techniques can reduce ambiguity , recall example  and the possible continuations shown in  . 
 The difficulty in these examples is determining whether the third sentence continues the thread begun by the first or second sentence . 
 For example , in  the preference technique which allows us to choose the first thread over the second is one which assigns a higher rating to a thread whose tense is parallel to that of the new sentence ; in this case both Sam rang the bell and Hannah opened the door are in the simple past tense . 
 In example  the fact that the key is mentioned only in the second sentence of  links  with the second thread . 
 To handle an example like third , we employ a preference for relating a sentence to a thread that has content words that are rated as semantically `` close '' to that of the sentence : 
 We store semantic patterns between words as a cheap and quick form of world knowledge ; these patterns are easier to provide than are the detailed world knowledge postulates required in some other approaches , and result in similar and sometimes more precise temporal structures with less processing overhead . 
 Using the semantic patterns we know that key and keyring are semantically close , and through that semantic link between the second and third sentences we prefer to connect the third sentence to the thread begun by the second . 
 The approach to representing semantic relationships we take is one used by Morris and Hirst wherein the words in the lexicon are associated with each other in a thesaurus-like fashion and given a rating according to how semantically `` close '' they are . 
 We thus avoid relying on high-level inferences and very specific world knowledge postulates , our goal being to determine the temporal structure as much as possible prior to the application of higher-level inferences . 
 Following Scha and Polanyi 1988 and Pruest et al. 1994 , our model of discourse consists of units called Discourse Constituent Units ( DCUs ) which are related by various temporal and rhetorical relations . 
 A basic DCU represents a sentence ( or clause ) , and complex DCUs are built up from basic and complex DCUs . 
 In our ALE implementation , a DCU contains the following slots for temporal information : 
 CUE_WORD : Cues to rhetorical structure , e.g. , `` because . '' 
 V_AND_NP_LIST : Contains content words found in this DCU , and is used to compare the content words of the current DCU with those in previous threads , in order to rate the semantic `` closeness '' of the DCU to each thread . 
  SEM_ASPECT : Contains the semantic aspect ( event , state , activity ) . 
 We have extended the Penn and Carpenter implementation of the HPSG grammar so that semantic aspect is calculated compositionally ( and stored here ) . 
 RHET_RELN : The relation between this DCU and a previous one . 
 Lexical items and phrases such as cue words ( stored in CUE_WORD ) affect the value of this slot . 
 TEMP_CENTER : Used for temporal centering ; Keeps track of the thread currently being followed ( since there is a preference for continuing the current thread ) and all the threads that have been constructed so far in the discourse . 
 FWD_CENTER : Existing threads 
 BKWD_CENTER : The thread currently being followed 
 CLOSED_THREADS : Threads no longer available for continuation . 
 TEMP_EXPR_RELNS : Stores the semantic interpretation of temporal expressions associated with this DCU . 
 TEMP_RELNS : Stores the temporal relations between the eventualities in the discourse . 
 TEMPFOC : The most recent event in the current thread which a subsequent eventuality may elaborate upon ( same-event ) , overlap , come just_after or precede . 
 TENASP : Keeps track of the tense and syntactic aspect of the DCU ( if the DCU is simple ) . 
 TENSE : past , pres , fut 
 ASPECT : simple , perf , prog , perf_prog . 
 To allow the above-mentioned types of information to mutually constrain each other , we employ a hierarchy of rhetorical and temporal relations ( illustrated in Figure  ) , using the ALE system in such a way that clues such as tense and cue words work together to reduce the number of possible temporal structures . 
 This approach improves upon earlier work on discourse structure such as Lascarides and Asher 1991 and Kehler 1994a in reducing the number of possible ambiguities ; it is also more precise than the Kamp / Hinrichs / Partee approach in that it takes into account ways in which the apparent defaults can be overridden and differentiates between events and activities , which behave differently in narrative progression . 
 Tense , aspect , rhetorical relations and temporal expressions affect the value of the RHET_RELN type that expresses the relationship between two DCUs : cue words are lexically marked according to what rhetorical relation they specify , and this relation is passed on to the DCU . 
 Explicit relation markers such as cue words and temporal relations must be consistent and take priority over indicators such as tense and aspect . 
 For example , sentence  will be ruled out because the cue phrase as a result conflicts with the temporal expression ten minutes earlier : 
 On the other hand , if temporal expressions indicate an overlap relation and cue words indicate a background relation as in  , these contributions are consistent and the RHET_RELN type will contain a background value ( the more specific value of the two ) : 
 For reasons of space it is difficult to give examples of the sign-based output of the grammar , or of the ALE rules , so we will restrict ourselves here to a summary of the algorithm and to a very limited rendition of the system output . 
 The algorithm used for calculating the temporal structure of a discourse can be summarised as follows . 
 It consists of two parts , the constraint-based portion and the preference-based portion : 
 The possible temporal / rhetorical relations are constrained . 
 If there is a temporal expression , it determines the temporal relationship of the new DCU to the previous ones , and defaults are ignored . 
 Lexical items such as cue words influence the value of the RHET_RELN type ( See Figure  ) . 
 If steps  and  attempt to place conflicting values in the RHET_RELN slot , the parse will fail . 
 If there is no temporal expression or cue phrase , tense and semantic aspect also influence the value of the RHET_RELN type ( See Table  ) , so that rhetorical relations , tense and aspect constrain each other . 
 If more than one possibility exists , semantic preferences are used to choose between the possibilities . 
 A `` semantic distance '' rating between the new DCU and each previous thread is determined . 
 ( If there are no existing threads a new thread is started . ) 
 Other preferences , such as a preference for relating the new DCU to a thread with parallel tense , are employed ( See Kameyama et al. 1993 , Poesio 1994 for details ) , and the resulting ratings are factored into the rating for each thread . 
 If the thread currently being followed is among the highest rated threads , this thread is continued . 
 ( This corresponds to temporal centering 's preference to continue the current thread . ) 
 If not , the DCU may continue any of the highest rated threads , and each of these solutions is generated . 
 Charts such as Table  provide the observations we use to fill in the value of RHET_RELN . 
 Those observations are summarised below . 
 In what follows , the event variable associated with  is  and the TEMPFOC of  is the most recent event / activity processed , possibly e  itself : 
  can overlap with e  if 
  describes a state , or 
  describes a state and  describes an activity . 
  can occur just-after the TEMPFOC of e  if 
  describes a simple tense event , or 
  describes a complex tense clause and  describes a complex tense event , or 
  describes an event and  describes an atelic or a simple tense state , or 
  describes a state and  describes a simple tense activity . 
  can precede e  if 
  describes an event , or 
  doesn't describe an activity and  describes a past perfect stative . 
  can elaborate on  if  describes an event , or 
  describes an activity and  describes an atelic , or 
  and  describe states and either  describes a simple tense state or 
  describes a complex tense state . 
 Using this algorithm , we can precisely identify the rhetorical and temporal relations when cue words to rhetorical structure are present , as in  : 
 We can also narrow the possibilities when no cue word is present by using constraints based on observations of tense and aspect interactions such as those shown in Table  . 
 For example , if  represents a simple past eventive sentence and  a past perfect eventive sentence , then in spite of the lack of rhetorical cues we know that e  precedes e  , as in  : 
 Also , when several structures are possible we can narrow the possibilities by using preferences , as in the examples below : 
 If we allow any of the four possible temporal relations between events , both continuations of sentence  would have 17 readings ( 4 x 4 + 1 reading in which the third sentence begins a new thread ) . 
 Using constraints , we reduce the number of readings to 4 . 
 Using preferences , we reduce that to 2 readings for each continuation . 
 The correct temporal relations are shown in  . 
 By using constraints and preferences , we can considerably reduce the amount of ambiguity in the temporal / rhetorical structure of a discourse . 
 However , explicit cues to rhetorical and temporal relations are not always available , and these cases result in more ambiguity than is desirable when processing large discourses . 
 Consider , however , that instead of generating all the possible temporal / rhetorical structures , we could use the information available to fill in the most restrictive type possible in the type hierarchy of temporal / rhetorical relations shown in Figure  . 
 We can then avoid generating the structures until higher-level information can be applied to complete the disambiguation process . 
 We presented a brief description of an algorithm for determining the temporal structure of discourse . 
 The algorithm is part of an HPSG-style discourse grammar implemented in Carpenter 's ALE formalism . 
 Its novel features are that it treats tense , aspect , temporal adverbials and rhetorical relations as mutually constraining ; it postulates less ambiguity than current temporal structuring algorithms do ; and it uses semantic closeness and other preference techniques rather than full-fledged world knowledge postulates to determine preferences over remaining ambiguities . 
 We also recommended using an underspecified representation of temporal / rhetorical structure to avoid generating all solutions until higher-level knowledge can aid in reducing ambiguity .
