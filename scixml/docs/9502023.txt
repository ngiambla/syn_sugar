 This paper presents an analysis of temporal anaphora in sentences which contain quantification over events , within the framework of Discourse Representation Theory . 
 The analysis in Partee 1984 of quantified sentences , introduced by a temporal connective , gives the wrong truth-conditions when the temporal connective in the subordinate clause is before or after . 
 This problem has been previously analyzed in de Swart 1991 as an instance of the proportion problem , and given a solution from a Generalized Quantifier approach . 
 By using a careful distinction between the different notions of reference time , based on Kamp and Reyle 1993 , we propose a solution to this problem , within the framework of DRT . 
 We show some applications of this solution to additional temporal anaphora phenomena in quantified sentences . 
 The analysis of temporal expressions in natural language discourse provides a challenge for contemporary semantic theories . 
 Partee 1973 introduced the notion of temporal anaphora , to account for ways in which temporal expressions depend on surrounding elements in the discourse for their semantic contribution to the discourse . 
 In this paper , we discuss the interaction of temporal anaphora and quantification over eventualities . 
 Such interaction , while interesting in its own right , is also a good test-bed for theories of the semantic interpretation of temporal expressions . 
 We discuss cases such as : 
 The analysis of sentences such as  in de Swart 1991 , within the framework of Discourse Representation Theory ( DRT ) Kamp 1981 gives the wrong truth-conditions , when the temporal connective in the sentence is before or after . 
 In DRT , such sentences trigger box-splitting with the eventuality of the subordinate clause and an updated reference time in the antecedent box , and the eventuality of the main clause in the consequent box , causing undesirable universal quantification over the reference time . 
 This problem is analyzed in de Swart 1991 as an instance of the proportion problem and given a solution from a Generalized Quantifier approach . 
 We were led to seek a solution for this problem within DRT , because of DRT 's advantages as a general theory of discourse , and its choice as the underlying formalism in another research project of ours , which deals with sentences such as  -  , in the context of natural language specifications of computerized systems . 
 In this paper , we propose such a solution , based on a careful distinction between different roles of Reichenbach 1947 's reference time , adapted from Kamp and Reyle 1993 . 
 Figure  shows a ` minimal pair ' of DRS 's for sentence  , one according to Partee 1984 's analysis and one according to ours . 
 An analysis of the mechanism of temporal anaphoric reference hinges upon an understanding of the ontological and logical foundations of temporal reference . 
 Different concepts have been used in the literature as primitives . 
 These range from temporal instants in Tense logic Prior 1967 , through intervals of time Bennet and Partee 1978(1972) as in the analysis of temporal connectives in Heinmki 1978 , to event structures Kamp 1979 as in Hinrichs 1986 's analysis of temporal anaphora . 
 An important factor in the interpretation of temporal expressions is the classification of situations into different aspectual classes ( or Aktionsarten ) , which is based on distributional and semantic properties . 
 In this paper , we only consider events and states , together termed eventualities in Bach 1981 . 
 In narrative sequences , event clauses seem to advance the narrative time , while states block its progression . 
 The mechanism used to account for this phenomena in Hinrichs 1986 and Partee 1984 , is based on the notion of reference time , originally proposed by Reichenbach 1947 . 
 Reichenbach 's well - known account of the interpretation of the different tense forms uses the temporal relations between three temporal indices : the utterance time , event time and reference time . 
 The reference time according to Reichenbach 1947 is determined either by context , or by temporal adverbials . 
 Hinrichs 's and Partee 's use of a notion of reference time , provides for a unified treatment of temporal anaphoric relations in discourse , which include narrative progression especially in sequences of simple past tense sentences , temporal adverbs and temporal adverbial clauses , introduced by a temporal connective . 
 This concept of reference time is no longer an instant of time , but rather , an interval . 
 This approach can be summarized as follows : in the processing of a discourse , the discourse-initial sentence is argued to require some contextually determined reference time . 
 Further event clauses in the discourse introduce a new event , which is included within the then-current reference time . 
 Each such event also causes the reference time to be updated to a time ` just after ' Partee 1984 this event . 
 State clauses introduce new states , which include the current reference time , and do not update it . 
 As an example of such an analysis consider the following narrative discourse Partee 1984 . 
 Figure  shows a DRS for the first two sentences of this discourse , according to Hinrichs 's and Partee 's analysis . 
 The ` n ' in the top DRS is a mnemonic for ` now ' - the utterance time . 
 The first event in the discourse ,  - John 's getting up - is interpreted relative to a contextually understood reference time ,  . 
 The event  is included in the current reference time ,  . 
 A new reference time marker ,  is then introduced . 
  lies immediately after  ( recorded as  ) . 
  serves as the current reference time for the following event  . 
 We continue in this fashion , updating the reference time , until the second sentence in the discourse is processed . 
 This sentence denotes a state ,  , which includes the then-current reference time . 
 Adverbial phrases , whether phrasal ( e.g. ` On Sunday ' ) or clausal ( e.g. ` When Bill left ' ) , are processed before the main clause . 
 They introduce a reference time , which overrides the current reference time , and provides an anaphoric antecedent for the tense in the main clause . 
 This mechanism is used to explain how tense and temporal adverbials can combine to temporally locate the occurrence , without running into problems of relative scope Hinrichs 1988 . 
 The tense morpheme of the main clause locates the event time with respect to the reference time , whereas temporal adverbials are used to locate the reference time . 
 When-clauses , for example , introduce a new reference time , which is ordered after the events described in the preceding discourse . 
 The eventuality in the when-clause is related to this reference time as discussed earlier with respect to narrative progression : a state includes its reference time , while an event is included in it . 
 The eventuality in the main clause is interpreted with respect to this reference time . 
 If the main clause is an event-clause , this event introduces a new reference time , just after the event time of the main clause . 
 As an example , consider the following discourse Partee 1984 . 
 Following Partee 1984 , we will not construct a full DRS for this discourse , but illustrate it with a diagram in Figure  , with circles denoting inclusion . 
 Partee 1984 extends Hinrichs 's treatment of temporal anaphora to the analysis of sentences , which contain a temporal adverbial and quantification over eventualities . 
 According to her analysis , these trigger box-splitting as do if or every clauses in DRT Kamp 1981 . 
 Consider the following example from Partee 1984 . 
 The subordinate clause cannot be interpreted relative to a single reference time , since Mary 's telephoning is not specified to occur at some specific time . 
 Still , the sentence needs to be interpreted relative to a reference time . 
 This reference time can be a large interval , and should contain each of the relevant occurrences of Mary 's telephoning during which Bill was asleep . 
 This reference time is represented as  in the top sub-DRS . 
 The ` whenever ' triggers box-splitting . 
 The event marker -  is introduced in the antecedent box , with the condition that it be temporally included in the current reference time ,  and be prior to n . 
 The ` whenever ' also causes the introduction of  , a new reference time marker . 
  lies ` just after '  . 
 The stative clause causes the introduction of  , which includes the reference time  . 
 The embedding conditions for the whole construction are just like those for a regular ` if ' or ` every ' clause , i.e. the sentence is true , if every proper embedding of the antecedent box can be extended to a proper embedding of the combination of the antecedent and the consequent boxes . 
 This means , as desired , that for each choice of an event  of Mary 's telephoning , and reference time  ` just after ' it , there is a state of Sam 's being asleep , that surrounds  . 
 A sentence such as  which is the same as sentence  , except the ` whenever ' is replaced by ` when ' , and ` always ' is added in the main clause , would get the same DRS . 
 As noted in Partee 1984 , this analysis does not extend in a straightforward manner to cases in which the operator when is replaced by ( an unrestricted ) before or after , in such quantified contexts . 
 Constructing a similar DRS for such sentences gives the wrong truth conditions . 
 For example , Figure  a shows a DRS for sentence  , according to the principles above . 
  - the reference time , used for the interpretation of the main clause is placed in the universe of the antecedent box . 
 Because the temporal connective is ` before ' ,  is restricted to lie before  . 
 The embedding conditions determine , that this reference time be universally quantified over , causing an erroneous reading in which for each event ,  , of John 's calling , for each earlier time  , he lights up a cigarette . 
 Paraphrasing this , we could say that John lights up cigarettes at all times preceding each phone call , not just once preceding each phone call . 
 We did not encounter this problem in the DRS in Figure  , since although the reference time  , is universally quantified over in that DRS as well , it is also restricted , to immediately follow  . 
 It is similarly restricted if ` before ' is replaced with ` just before ' or ` ten minutes before ' . 
 But , ( unrestricted ) ` before ' is analyzed as ` some time before ' , and thus the problem arises . 
 We will henceforth informally refer to this problem as Partee 's quantification problem . 
 Partee 1984 suggests that in these cases we somehow have to insure that the reference time ,  , appears in the universe of the consequent DRS , causing it to be existentially quantified over , giving the desired interpretation . 
 de Swart 1991 notes that simply moving  to the right-hand box does not agree with Hinrichs 's assumption , that temporal clauses are processed before the main clause , since they update the reference time , with respect to which the main clause will be interpreted . 
 In our proposed solution , the ` reference time ' is indeed moved to the right box , but it is a different notion of reference time , and ( as will be shown ) exempt from this criticism . 
 de Swart 1991 sees Partee 's quantification problem as a temporal manifestation of the proportion problem , which arises in cases such as Kadmon 1990 . 
 The sentence is false in the case where out of ten women , one owns 50 cats and is happy , while the other nine women own only one cat each , and are miserable . 
 This will not be predicted by the unselective binding of quantifiers in DRT , which quantify over all the free variables in their scope , in this case women-cat pairs . 
 According to de Swart 1991 Partee 's quantification problem is similar - the universal quantifier in sentences such as  binds pairs of events and updated reference times , where the desired quantificational scheme is universal quantification for the event and existential for the reference time . 
 de Swart 1991 offers a solution from a Generalized Quantifier approach , based on the analysis of quantified NPs in transitive sentences . 
 In this analysis , the reference time is an implicit variable , which is needed in the interpretation of the temporal relation , but is not part of the quantificational structure . 
 Temporal connectives are viewed as relations , TC , between two sets of events : 
 The quantificational structure of such sentences can be analyzed either by an iteration of monadic quantifiers , or as a single dyadic quantifier of type  .
 In the first approach , adverbs of quantification ( Q-adverbs ) are assigned the structure : 
 In  ,  and  denote , respectively , the sets of events described by the subordinate and the main clause ,  denotes the image set of  under the temporal connective TC , i.e. the set of events  which are related to  via the relation TC , ( presented in  ) . 
 In the second approach , the structure is : 
 De Swart 's solution does overcome Partee 's quantification problem , although not within DRT . 
 As such , the existential quantification in  has to be stipulated , whereas our analysis acquires this existential quantification ` for free ' . 
 Our analysis of Partee 's quantification problem uses a different notion of reference time than that used by the accounts in the exposition above . 
 Following Kamp and Reyle 1993 , we split the role of the reference time , used to account for a large array of phenomena , into several independent mechanisms . 
 This separation allows for an analysis in DRT of temporal subordinate clauses in quantified sentences , which avoids Partee 's problem altogether . 
 The mechanisms we discuss are : the location time , Rpt and perf . 
 DRSs will contain temporal markers corresponding to location times and Rpts . 
 The location time is an interval , used to temporally locate eventualities , in accordance with their aspectual classification . 
 Events are included in their location time ( recorded in the DRS as  on the respective markers ) , while states temporally overlap their location time ( recorded as  ) . 
 The verb tense determines the relation between the location time and the utterance time e.g. if the tense is simple past , the location time lies anteriorly to the utterance time . 
 When it is simple present , the location time coincides with the utterance time . 
 Temporal adverbials restrict the location time : temporal adverbs introduce a DRS-condition on the location time , while temporal subordinate clauses introduce a relation between the event time of the subordinate clause and the location time of the main clause . 
 The exact temporal relation denoted by a temporal connective depends on the aspectual classes of the eventualities related by it . 
 For example , in the following sentence  , the event triggers the introduction of an event marker e , and location time marker t , into the DRS with the DRS-condition  . 
 The past tense of the verb adds the condition  . 
 In sentence  , the location time of the event in the main clause is restricted to fall ( just ) after the event time of the event of the subordinate clause . 
 Narrative progression is dealt with by using the feature Rpt ( or reference point ) . 
 The Rpt can be either an event or a time discourse marker , already present in the DRS ( recorded as assignment Rpt : = e ) . 
 Eventualities are interpreted with respect to the Rpt - events are taken to follow the current Rpt , while states include it . 
 The Rpt is reset during the processing of the discourse . 
 Note that in a ` terminal ' DRS ( ready for an embedding test ) , all the auxiliary Rpts ` disappear ' ( do not participate in the embedding ) . 
 The perfect is analyzed by using the notion of a nucleus Moens and Steedman 1988 to account for the inner structure of an eventuality . 
 A nucleus is defined as a structure containing a preparatory process , culmination and consequent state . 
 The categorization of verb phrases into different aspectual classes can be phrased in terms of which part of the nucleus they refer to . 
 The perfect is seen in Kamp and Reyle 1993 as an aspectual operator . 
 The eventualities described by the perfect of a verb refer to the consequent state of its nucleus . 
 For example , the following sentence  denotes the state , s , holding at the present , that Mary has met the president . 
 This state is a result of the event e , in which Mary met the president . 
 Temporally , the state s starts just when e ends , or as it is put in Kamp and Reyle 1993 : e and s abut , ( represented as e  s ) . 
 By extending the analysis of temporal subordinate clauses in Kamp and Reyle 1993 , to sentences which include quantification over eventualities , we can propose an alternative DRT solution to Partee 's quantification problem . 
 As in Partee 1984 , such sentences trigger box-splitting . 
 But now , the location time of the eventuality in the subordinate clause serves as the antecedent for the location time of the eventuality in the main clause . 
 In this approach , each of the relevant temporal markers resides in its appropriate box , yielding the correct quantificational structure . 
 This quantification structure does not need to be stipulated as part of the Q-adverb 's meaning , but arises directly from the temporal system . 
 We illustrate this analysis by constructing a DRS in Figure  b for sentence  . 
 In this DRS , n denotes the utterance time . 
 The subordinate clause triggers the introduction of an event marker , e , with its event time marker t . 
 The main clause triggers the introduction of an event marker e ' , and its location time marker t ' , with the DRS-condition  . 
 The assymetry in using the event time for e and the location time for e ' arises from the interpretation rules of temporal connectives ( for both quantified and non-quantified sentences ) . 
 Since the temporal connective in this sentence is before , the relation between these two markers is one of precedence . 
 We adopt a suggestion by Chierchia in Partee 1984 , that the whole implication be rendered as a state . 
 This state is no longer an atomic eventuality . 
 It is a complex state denoting John 's habit . 
 This state holds during the present , and so its location time is n . 
 This solution is not prone to de Swart 1991 's criticism against the naive solution of moving the reference time to the right DRS . 
 The temporal clause may be processed before the main clause , since t ' , the location time of e ' , which ` replaces '  , the reference time of Partee 's analysis , as the temporal index of the eventuality in the the main clause , arises from processing the main clause ( not updating the reference time of the subordinate clause ) . 
 In this section we present some applications of our analysis to related constructions . 
 First , we consider the past perfect , as in sentence  . 
 de Swart 1991 gives this example to illustrate the inability to interpret temporal connectives without the use of the reference times . 
 According to de Swart 1991 , the subordinate clause determines the reference time of the verb , which lies anteriorly to the event time . 
 Trying to use the event times would give the wrong analysis . 
 This would seem to be troublesome for our approach , which uses the location time of the event in the main clause , and not its reference time . 
 However , this is not a problem , since our analysis of the perfect by the use of the operator perf , analyses the eventuality referred to by the main clause , as the result state of a previous event . 
 The temporal relation in the sentence is inclusion between the event time of Anne 's coming home , and the location time of the result state of Paul 's already having prepared dinner . 
 Next , we consider narrative progression in quantified contexts , as in sentence  . 
 The basic construction is just the same as in the paradigm structure , but now we have narrative progression in the consequent box . 
 This narrative progression is handled as ordinary narrative progression in Kamp and Reyle 1993 , i.e. by resetting the Rpt . 
 The DRS in Figure  describes the complex state  , that after each event of John 's coming home , there is a sequence of subsequent events according to his activities . 
 Finally , we deal with sentences such as  , which contain an iteration of an implicit generic quantifier and always . 
 The situation described by John 's always squinting when the sun is shining is analyzed as a complex state  . 
 This state holds whenever John is at the beach , recorded by the condition that the location time  of  overlaps the event time ,  of John 's being at the beach ,  in Figure  .
