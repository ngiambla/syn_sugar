 Both anaphora resolution and prepositional phrase ( PP ) attachment are the most frequent ambiguities in natural language processing . 
 Several methods have been proposed to deal with each phenomenon separately , however none of proposed systems has considered the way of dealing both phenomena . 
 We tackle this issue here , proposing an algorithm to co-ordinate the treatment of these two problems efficiently , i.e. , the aim is also to exploit at each step all the results that each component can provide . 
 Several methods have been proposed to deal with anaphora resolution and prepositional phrase ( PP ) attachment phenomenon and separately , so that the literature is very abundant : for PPs see e.g. , Frazier and Fodor 1979 , Hobbs 1990 , Wilks and Huang 1985 ) , and for anaphora see e.g. , Carter 1986 , Reinhart 1983 , Sidner 1983 . 
 However none of these methods has considered the way of dealing both phenomena in the same concrete system . 
 We propose in this paper an algorithm that deals with both phenomena , in the same analyser . 
 The anaphora module pertains to the recent methods , uses a set of resolution rules based on the focusing approach Sidner 1983 . 
 These rules are applied to the conceptual representation and their output is a set of candidate antecedents . 
 Concerning the PPs , unattached prepositions involve empty or unfilled roles in the Conceptual Structures ( CSs ) , expressed in a frame-based language Zarri 1992 . 
 The disambiguation procedure aims at filling the empty roles using attachment rules . 
 This work was accomplished in the context of COBALT project ( LRE 61 - 011 ) , dealing with financial news . 
 A detailed discussion about both procedures of anaphora resolution and PP attachment is largely developed in Azzam 1994 . 
 Two of the main principles of the algorithm are : 
 The algorithm is applied on the text sentence by sentence , i.e. the ambiguities of the previous sentences have already been considered ( resolved or not ) . 
 The anaphora procedure skips the resolution of a given anaphor when this anaphor is preceded by an unattached preposition . 
 This is because the resolution rules may have an empty role as a parameter , due to this unattached preposition . 
 The resolution of the anaphor is then postponed to the second phase of anaphora resolution . 
 The proposed procedure is based on successive calls to the anaphora module and to the PP attachment module . 
 The output of each call is a set of CSs that represent the intermediate results exchanged between each call and on which both modules operate in turn . 
 The aim is to fill the unfilled roles in the CSs , due to anaphora or unattached PPs. To summarize the algorithm is : 
 Apply the anaphora module first . 
 Apply the PP attachment procedure . 
 If some anaphora are left unresolved , apply the anaphora module again . 
 If there are still unattached PPs , apply the attachment procedure again . 
 Repeat  and  , until all PPs and anaphors are treated . 
 The order in which the two modules are called is based on efficiency deduced from statistical data performed on COBALT corpuses . 
 Three main cases are faced by the algorithm : 
 When the anaphor occurs before a given preposition in the sentence , its resolution does not depend on where the preposition is to be attached ( except for cataphors that are quite rare ) . 
 In this case the anaphora module can be applied before the attachment procedure . 
 The example  below shows that the resolution of the anaphoric pronoun that must be performed first and that the PP starting with of be attached later . 
 When the anaphor occurs after one or several unattached prepositions , it could be an intra-sentential anaphor ( i.e. referring to an entity in the same sentence ) , then its resolution may depend on one of the previous prepositional phrases . 
 In this case , the resolution of the anaphora is postponed to a next call of the anaphora module according to principle  stated above . 
 When the anaphor is included in a PP ( particular case of  ) , PP attachment rules need semantic information about the `` object '' of the PP ; when it is a pronoun , no semantic information is available , so that the attachment rules can not be applied . 
 The anaphoric pronouns have to be resolved first , so as to determine what semantic class they refer to ; the PP attachment procedure can then be applied . 
 When a sequence contains more than two such PPs , i.e. , with anaphors as objects , the length of a cycle is more than 4 . 
 The pronoun its can not be resolved by the anaphora resolution module because it is preceded by unattached PPs ; its resolution is skipped . 
 The PP attachment procedure is then called to determine the attachment of since and at while the object of the in PP comprises an anaphoric pronoun its ( case  ) and the on PP is preceded by its . 
 The attachment of both PPs is then skipped . 
 The anaphora module is called again to resolve the anaphoric pronoun its , which is possible , in this example , since the previous PPs have been attached and there is no anaphors before . 
 Finally , the PP attachment procedure has to be called again for the in and on PPs . 
 Notice that even if each module is called several times , there is no redundancy in the processing . 
 The algorithm should be considered as the splitting of both anaphora resolution and PP attachment procedures into several phases and not as the repetition of each procedure . 
 The objective was to emphasise more than it has been done until now , the fact that PP attachment and anaphora resolution could interact in the same system in order to produce a complete conceptual analysis , instead of slowing down each other . 
 The algorithm we proposed in this paper , is independent of the used approaches in both anaphora and attachment modules . 
 It concerns rather the way of managing the interaction between the two modules . 
 Our actual work addresses more the problems inside each module . 
 The attachment module has been implemented at 99 % . 
 Presently we are working on the extension of the anaphora module particularly to deal also with the anaphoric definite noun phrases .
