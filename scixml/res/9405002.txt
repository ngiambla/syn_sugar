 Several researchers Partee 1984 , Hinrichs 1986 , Nerbonne 1986 , Webber 1988 have sought to explain the temporal relations induced by tense by treating it as anaphoric , drawing on Reichenbach 's separation between event , speech , and reference times Reichenbach 1947 .
 Specifically , if a treatment such as Hinrichs 's is used to explain the forward progression of time in example , then it must be explained why sentence is as felicitous as sentence .
 That is , one would predict a clash of temporal relations for sentence , since the simple pasts induce the forward progression of time but the conjunction indicates the reverse temporal ordering .
 Specifically , because the use of the simple past in passage is as felicitous as the past perfect in passage under the explanation interpretation ( in these cases indicated explicitly by because ) , then it must be explained why passage is not understood as an explanation as is passage , where in each case the relationship needs to be inferred .
 In passage , the auxiliary had refers to the event time of the slipping , and thus the past tense on spill creates a temporal entity constrained to precede that time .
 The incoherence of example is predicted by both their and our accounts by virtue of the fact that there is no coherence relation that corresponds to Narration with reverse temporal ordering .
 In addressing this example , Lascarides and Asher specify a special rule ( the Connections When Changing Tense ( CCT ) Law ) that stipulates that a sentence containing the simple past followed by a sentence containing the past perfect can be related only by a subset of the otherwise possible coherence relations .
