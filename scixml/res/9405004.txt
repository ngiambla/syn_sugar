 Since head-driven generation in general has its merits , we simply return to a syntactic definition of ` head ' and demonstrate the feasibility of syntactic-head-driven generation .
 In addition to its generality , a syntactic-head-driven algorithm provides a basis for a logically well-defined treatment of the movement of ( syntactic ) heads , for which only ad-hoc solutions existed , so far .
 Shieber et al. 1990 proposed to define the ` head ' constituent h of phrase with category x on semantic grounds : the semantic representations of h and x are identical .
 This puts a strong restriction on the shape of semantic analysis rules : one of the leaves must share its semantic form with the root node .
 However , on the long run , the tree notation suggests a more general relation , e.g. more internal structure or additional , terminal leaf nodes in the local syntax tree .
 In order to simplify the representation in the following , we assume that each syntax tree in a grammar is isomorphic to the corresponding semantic analysis tree .
 This means that both trees can merged into one tree by labeling the nodes with syntax-semantics-pairs : In Shieber et al. 1990 an ad-hoc solution was proposed to enforce termination when the semantic head has been moved .
