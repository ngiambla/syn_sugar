 In Section , we categorize elliptical and event referential forms according to two features : whether the expression leaves behind an empty constituent in the syntax , and whether the expression is anaphoric in the semantics .
 Recall from Section that gapping constructions such as are only felicitous with the symmetric ( i.e. , Common Topic ) meaning of and : This fact is predicted by our account in the following way .
 In the case of Common Topic constructions , the missing sentence in the target will be copied from the source , the sentential semantics may be derived , and the arguments to the coherence relations can be identified and reasoning carried out , predicting felicity .
 In our analysis , we expect cases of pure contrast to pattern with the parallel class since these are Common Topic constructions ; this is opposed to the violated expectation use of but which indicates a Coherent Situation relation .
 The current account makes the correct predictions ; examples and , where but has the contrast meaning , appear to be markedly less acceptable than examples and , where but has the violated expectation meaning : To summarize thus far , the data presented in the earlier account as well as examples that conflict with that analysis are all predicted by the account given here .
 The interaction between the two features and the two types of discourse inference predicts facts concerning gapping , VP-ellipsis , event reference , and interclausal coherence for which it is otherwise difficult to account .
 In future work we will address other forms of ellipsis and event reference , as well as integrate a previous account of strict and sloppy ambiguity into this framework Kehler 1993a .
