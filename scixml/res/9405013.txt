 Depending on how the referring plan constrains the choice of referent , she constructs an instance of either reject-plan or postpone-plan , whose resulting surface speech actions are s-reject and s-postpone respectively .
 In our model , each agent associates a numeric confidence value with each of the attributes in the referring expression , and by composing these , computes a level of confidence in the adequacy of the complete referring expression plan that can be interpreted as ranging from low confidence to high confidence .
 The present composition function is simple addition , but one could envision more complex systems to compute confidence , such as an algebra of confidence or a non-numeric system .
 That is , if the agent is the initiator , she believes that the other will be able to understand the reference ; if the agent is the other , he believes that he has understood the reference .
 An agent uses his salience hierarchy for two related purposes : the first to determine what is salient in a particular situation , and the second to determine the adequacy of a description .
 In plan construction , the hierarchy is used for constructing initial referring expression plans , and for elaborating on inadequate plans by allowing an agent to choose the most salient properties of the referent first .
 So , for a referring plan to be valid , it must describe a unique object , and it must be adequate with respect to the speaker 's beliefs .
