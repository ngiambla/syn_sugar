 However if there can be relations between every pair of semantic roles , the amount of computation to identify the relations that hold in the given sentence is extremely large .
 In this paper , for semantics of Japanese complex sentence , we introduce new pragmatic roles called observer and motivated respectively to bridge semantic roles of subordinate and those of main clauses .
 By these new roles constraints on the relations among semantic / pragmatic roles are known to be almost local within subordinate or main clause .
 In other words , as for the semantics of the whole complex sentence , the only role we should deal with is a motivated .
 These categories ' forms are `` P-garu '' or its past form `` P-gat-ta '' , where P is a subjective adjective ( category 4 in Table ) or is a verb followed by ta-gar ( category 5 in Table ) , and is the experiencer of P which is possibly zero .
 The SEM feature of `` P-garu / gat-ta '' is the following . where `` '' means `` not token identical . '' In our FS , constraints for tokens like are written with `` where '' as shown in this FS .
 If a clause with `` garu / gat-ta '' is a subordinate clause , the experiencer cannot be identified with a semantic role corresponding to the subject of main clause or higher clause .
