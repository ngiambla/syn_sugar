 In the general case , the off-line variant ( in which all unifications are deferred until the complete CF parse forest has been constructed ) is not guaranteed to terminate ; indeed , it usually does not do so with the ANLT grammar .
 However , a drawback to the on-line algorithm is that a variant of Kipps 's caching cannot be used , since the cache must necessarily assume that all reductions at a given vertex with all rules with the same number of daughters build exactly the same constituent every time ; in general this is not the case when the daughters are unification categories .
 The grammar is defined in metagrammatical formalism which is compiled into a unification-based ` object grammar ' -- a syntactic variant of the Definite Clause Grammar formalism Pereira and Warren 1980 -- containing 84 features and 782 phrase structure rules .
 The grammar provides full coverage of the following constructions : declarative sentences , imperatives and questions ( yes / no , tag and wh-questions ) ; all unbounded dependency types ( topicalisation , relativisation , wh-questions ) ; a relatively exhaustive treatment of verb and adjective complement types ; phrasal and prepositional verbs of many complement types ; passivisation ; verb phrase extraposition ; sentence and verb phrase modification ; noun phrase complements and pre - and post-modification ; partitives ; coordination of all major category types ; and nominal and adjectival comparatives .
 Unless grammar size takes on proportionately much more significance for such longer inputs , which seems implausible , it appears that in fact the major problems do not lie in the area of grammar size , but in input length .
 This theoretical bound might suggest that parsing performance would be severely degraded on long sentences ; however , the relationship between length of sentence and parse time with the ANLT grammar and the sentences tested appears to be approximately only quadratic .
 There are probably many reasons why performance is much better than the complexity results suggest , but the most important may be that : kleene star is used only in a very limited context ( for the analysis of coordination ) , more than 90 % of the rules in the grammar have no more than two daughters , and very few rules license both left and right recursion ( for instance of the sort that is typically used to analyse noun compounding , i.e. ) .
