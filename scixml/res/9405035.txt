 Psycholinguistic knowledge would be greatly helpful , as we believe , in constructing an artificial language processing system .
 As for machine translation , we should take advantage of our understandings of how the languages are represented in human mind ; how the representation is mapped from one language to another ; how the representation and mapping are acquired by human .
 The general dual-coding theory hypothesizes that human represents language with dual systems -- the verbal system and the imagery system .
 The elements of the imagery system , called `` imagens '' , are connected to the logogens in the verbal systems via referential connections .
 The bilingual dual-coding theory proposes an architecture in which a common imagery system is connected to two verbal systems , and the two verbal systems are interconnected to each other via associative connections [ Figure ] .
 Unlike the within-language associations , which are rich and diverse , these between-language associations involve primarily translation equivalent terms that are experienced together frequently .
 Through the connections between the two layers , the output units are activated , and the lexical item that corresponds to the most active output unit is selected as the head of the target f-structure .
