 The model we propose is that an agent 's behavior is determined by a number of factors , including that agent 's current goals in the domain , and a set of obligations that are induced by a set of social conventions .
 If an utterance has not been understood , or is believed to be deficient in some way , this brings about an obligation to repair the utterance .
 Obligations ( or at least beliefs that the agent has obligations ) will thus form an important part of the reasoning process of a deliberative agent , e.g. , the architecture proposed by Bratman et al. 1988 .
 In addition to considering beliefs about the world , which will govern the possibility of performing actions and likelyhood of success , and desires or goals which will govern the utility or desirability of actions , a social agent will also have to consider obligations , which govern the permissibility of actions .
 In question answering , the actor will query its beliefs and will answer depending on the result , which might be that the system does not know the answer .
 In most cases , the actor will merely form the intention to produce the appropriate utterance , waiting for a chance , according to turn-taking conventions , to actually generate the utterance .
 Utterances and are interpreted , but not responded to yet since the user keeps the turn ( in this case by following up with subsequent utterances before the system has a chance to act ) .
