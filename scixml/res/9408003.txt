 M abstracts u under I iff [ M is a morph , I is an interpretation , u is an object in I , for each and each , iff is defined , is defined , and , and for each and each , iff is defined , and .
 However , I use theorem and resolved feature structures to yield a less general interpretation free characterisation of a satisfiable feature structure that admits of such an algorithm .
 R is a resolved feature structure iff [ R is a feature structure , is a total function from Q to , and for each and each , [ if is defined then is defined , and Each resolved feature structure is a well-typed Carpenter 1992 feature structure with output alphabet .
 R is a resolvant of F iff [ R is a resolved feature structure , F is a feature structure , and for each , Proposition 21 .
 For each interpretation I , each object u in I and each feature structure F , [ F is true of u under I iff some resolvant of F is true of u under I .
 Construct as follows : for each feature structure , set and . while is not empty . do = set . if ` true ' , ` true ' , and then set . if then output . is an effective algorithm , and for each feature structure F , a list of the resolvants of F .
 If is rational and computable then for some effective function , for each feature structure F , if F is satisfiable then ` true otherwise ` false ' .
