 From the practical point of view , word classification addresses questions of data sparseness and generalization in statistical language models , particularly models for deciding among alternative analyses proposed by a grammar .
 It is well known that a simple tabulation of frequencies of certain words participating in certain configurations , for example of frequencies of pairs of a transitive main verb and the head noun of its direct object , cannot be reliably used for comparing the likelihoods of different alternative configurations .
 Furthermore , a similar relation holds between for two empirical distributions p and p ' and the probability that p and p ' are drawn from the same distribution q .
 With respect to our problem , thus gives us the loss of information in using cluster centroid instead of the actual distribution for word when modeling the distributional properties of n .
 The most important property of the free energy is that its minimum determines the balance between the `` disordering '' maximum entropy and `` ordering '' distortion minimization in which the system is most likely to be found .
 As explained there , our clustering procedure yields for each value of a set of clusters minimizing the free energy F , and the asymmetric model for estimates the conditional verb distribution for a noun n by where also depends on .
 As a first experiment , we used our method to classify the 64 nouns appearing most frequently as heads of direct objects of the verb `` fire '' in one year ( 1988 ) of Associated Press newswire .
