 On the one hand , in Basili et al. 1992 approach , semantic classes relevant to the domain are chosen , and consequently , the adjustment of the classes to the corpus is quite nice .
 In different iterations over these candidate classes , two operations are performed : first , the class , c , having the best Assoc ( best class ) , is extracted for the final result ; and second , the remaining candidate classes are filtered from classes being hyper / hyponyms to the best class .
 On the one hand , 235 ( 8.8 % ) of these triples were considered to be extracted erroneously because of the parser , and 51 ( 1.9 % ) because of the lemmatizer .
 Summarizing , 2,372 ( 89.2 % ) of the triples in the testing set were considered to be correctly extracted and lemmatized .
 On the one hand , how many of the noun occurrences have one or more senses included in the taxonomy : 113,583 of the 117,215 extracted triples ( 96.9 % ) .
 Each row shows : the type of diagnostic , the number and percentage of classes that accomplish it , and the number and percentage of noun occurrences contained by these classes in the testing sample .
 Analyzing the results obtained from the testing sample ( some of which are shown in tables and ) we draw some positive ( , ) and some negative conclusions ( , , and ) : Almost one correct semantic class for each syntactic position in the sample is acquired .
