 As described in Grosz et al. 1986 , the process of centering attention on entities in the discourse gives rise to the intersentential transitional states of continuing , retaining and shifting .
 In the approach to discourse structure developed in Sidner 1983 and Grosz et al. 1986 , a discourse exhibits both global and local coherence .
 On this view , a key element of local coherence is centering , a system of rules and constraints that govern the relationship between what the discourse is about and some of the linguistic choices made by the discourse participants , e.g. choice of grammatical function , syntactic structure , and type of referring expression ( proper noun , definite or indefinite description , reflexive or personal pronoun , etc . ) Pronominalization in particular serves to focus attention on what is being talked about ; inappropriate use or failure to use pronouns causes communication to be less fluent .
 Note also that the Cb of Grosz et al. 1986 corresponds roughly to Sidner 's discourse focus and the Cf to her potential foci .
 The formal system of constraints and rules for centering , as we have interpreted them from Grosz et al. 1986 , are as follows .
 A shift is inevitable because of constraint 3 , which states that the must equal the ( since the is directly realized by the subject of , `` Friedman '' ) .
 However the constraints and rules from Grosz et al. 1986 would fail to make a choice here between the co-specification possibilities for the pronouns in .
