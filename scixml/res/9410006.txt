 We present the quantitative results of hand-simulating these algorithms , but this analysis naturally gives rise to both a qualitative evaluation and recommendations for performing such evaluations in general .
 These are problems with : allowing for underlying assumptions , determining how to handle underspecifications , and evaluating the contribution of false positives and error chaining .
 This includes such things as being able to recover syntactically recoverable omitted text , such as elided verb phrases , and the identities of the speakers and hearers in a dialogue .
 A major component of any discourse algorithm is the prediction of which entities are salient , even though all the factors that contribute to the salience of a discourse entity have not been identified Prince 1981 , Prince 1985 , Brown and Fish 1983, Hudson et al. 1986 .
