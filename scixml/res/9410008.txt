 A simple method for categorizing texts into pre-determined text genre categories using the statistical standard technique of discriminant analysis is demonstrated with application to the Brown corpus .
 Discriminant analysis makes it possible use a large number of parameters that may be specific for a certain corpus or information stream , and combine them into a small number of functions , with the parameters weighted on basis of how useful they are for discriminating text genres .
 Given this variation , in a text retrieval context the problems are identifying genres , and choosing criteria to cluster texts of the same genre , with predictable precision and recall .
 Texts about certain topics may only occur in certain genres , and texts in certain genres may only treat certain topics ; most topics do , however , occur in several genres , which is what interests us here .
 The territorial maps shown in figures , , and are intuitively useful tools for displaying what type a particular text is , compared with other existing texts .
 The technique demonstrated above has an obvious application in information retrieval , for picking out interesting texts , if content based methods select a too large set for easy manipulation and browsing Cutting et al. 1992 .
 In an envisioned application , a user will employ a cascade of filters starting with filtering by topic , and continuing with filters by genre or text type , and ending by filters for text quality , or other tentative finer-grained qualifications .
