 This paper discusses the lexicographical concept of lexical functions Mel'cuk and Zolkovsky 1984 and their potential exploitation in the development of a machine translation lexicon designed to handle collocations .
 We show how lexical functions can be thought to reflect cross-linguistic meaning concepts for collocational structures and their translational equivalents , and therefore suggest themselves as some kind of language-independent semantic primitives from which translation strategies can be developed .
 The project has tried to investigate the use of lexical functions as an interlingual device , i.e. , one which is shared by the semantic representations of collocations in the language pairs .
 The semantic relation between the phrase heavy smoker and its French counterpart can be made explicit in the following bilingual sign : Typically , the lexicon will contain a bilingual sign for each possible value of RELN .
 Thus , for translating heavy smoker into grand fumeur we will need the obvious entry for smoker-fumeur plus the entry below : The interlingual status of the lexical function is self-evident .
 In fact it has been asserted by some Anick and Pustejovsky 1990 , Heid and Raab 1989 that collocational systems are systematically predictable from the lexical semantics of nouns .
 In an attempt to explore this notion further , we have investigated the approach to nominal semantics known as Qualia structure Pustejovsky 1991 and considered how this may complement the LF notion to improve its descriptive power .
