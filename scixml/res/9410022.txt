 Finally , two implementations -- one for each technique -- are described and then compared using both artificial and real data for sequences of up to 20 tones .
 Unfortunately , it is not possible in general to provide a model for partial or total downstep which permits distinct asymptotes for H and L .
 Therefore , to the extent that Figure is typical of tone languages in having different H and L asymptotes , one must conclude that total and partial downstep are qualitative terms only .
 Regrettably , the LL data was only available from isolated disyllables , and other sequences such as LH and H H were not available at all .
 However , from the F data for the above utterances we can hypothesise the behaviour of these unseen sequences , and this can be tested in subsequent empirical work .
 The results for utterances involving HH and LL sequences are displayed in Figure , while results for L H and HL are displayed in Figure .
 The regression equations obtained from these data are displayed in , where the number of occurrences of each tone sequence is given in parentheses after the sequence .
