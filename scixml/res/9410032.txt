 Rather than recording the semantic objects and their properties , our discourse model consists basically of the part of the input proof tree which has already been conveyed .
 The discourse model is also segmented into an attentional hierarchy , where subproofs posted by a top-down presentation operators as subtasks constitute attentional units .
 The following are some notions useful for the formulation of the presentation operators : Task is the subproof in the input proof whose presentation is the current task .
 In contrast with operators employed in RST-based planners that split goals according to the rhetorical structures , our operators encode standard schemata for presenting proofs , which contain subgoals .
 The feature values can be divided into two groups : those characterizing the style of the text this operator produces , and those concerning other planning aspects . `` Implicit '' is a stylistic feature value , indicating that the splitting of the proof into the three subgoals is not made explicit .
 In its explicit dual Case-Explicit a PCA is added to the beginning of the Acts slot , which produces the verbalization : `` To prove Q , let us first prove , and consider the two cases separately . '' The feature value `` compulsory '' indicates that if the applicability condition is satisfied , and the style of the operator conforms to the global style the text planner is committed to , this operator should be chosen .
 If the conclusion , the premises and the method are instantiated to , ( , ) , def-subset respectively , the following verbalization can be produced : `` Since a is an element of , and is a subset of , a is an element of according to the definition of subset . '' A trivial subproof may be presented as a single derivation by omitting the intermediate nodes .
