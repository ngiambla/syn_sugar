 The general aim of this paper is to show how to use focus to decompose the interpretation of a phrase into two parts , where one part is the interpretation of the focussed item and the other is some object with which this can combine .
 Suppose , for example , we thought that the VP ` ate a peach ' should be interpreted as : In other words , this VP is an abstraction over events where somebody ate a peach .
 Then we would want the two objects corresponding to the interpretation of ate a peach to be something like : and Here we have extracted the denotation of peach as the property of being a peach , and converted the interpretation of the VP to an abstraction which will combine appropriately with this property to reproduce the original interpretation .
 Consider the following phrases : In the property of being a man combines with the property of being someone who stole your bike to construct a contextually minimal unique characterisation of the relevant individual , and similarly in .
 To achieve this , we need to interpret the relative pronouns in the two relative clauses as leaving a hole in the interpretation of clause and then abstracting with respect to that hole .
 This is clear for , but it also holds for if we want to interpret a sentence like a man stole a bike as where the quantifier introduced by the subject does not in fact have maximal scope ( an analysis I have argued for elsewhere Ramsay 1992a ) .
 The treatment of clearly requires much the same mechanism as we will require if we want to deal with focus as outlined above , and this may or may not also hold for .
