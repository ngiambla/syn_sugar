 The most important two rules are as follows : The rule corresponds to - conversion of the ordinary - calculus Hindley and Seldin 1986 .
 In this subsection , we introduce two combinators that enable us to change the order of - conversion , proposed by Steedman 1988 , as a kind of type change Dowty 1988 .
 C-combinator changes the order of - variables as follows : Another requirement for exchanges of the order of - conversion is the following case .
 Suppose that we are required to compose all the following typed objects : In such a case , we need to concatenate g and a first , and then g(a) becomes applicable to f .
 However , with the help of the following B-combinator : The - variable in g can be shifted beyond the scope of f so that we can concatenate f and g first , and , thus , have a become applicable as in Fig. .
 Because all the three nouns are adequately concatenated by ` read ' , a sentential representation is made in the subworld of .
 In , 's are the records of unification , that contain the costs and the original types ; they become necessary when they are backtracked , and in that meaning , those bindings are transitive .
