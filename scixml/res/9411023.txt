 If the text is written loosely , the rhetorical structure generally contains many BothNucleus relations ( e.g. , parallel ( mata ( and , also ) ) , and the system cannot gradate the penalties and cannot reduce sentences smoothly .
 After sentences of each paragraph are reduced , inter-paragraph structure reduction is carried out in the same way based on the relative importance judgement on the inter-paragraph rhetorical structure .
 If the penalty calculation mentioned above is accomplished for the rhetorical structure shown in Fig. , each penalty score is calculated as shown in Fig. .
 In Fig. italic numbers are the penalties the system imposed on each node of the structure , and broken lines are the boundary between the nodes imposed different penalty scores .
 The figure shows that sentence four and five have penalty score three , that sentence three has two , that sentence one and two have one , and that sentence six has no penalty score .
 As for the technical papers , the average length ratio ( abstract / original ) was 24 % , and the coverage of the key sentence and the most important key sentence were 51 % and 74 % respectively .
 Whereas , as for the editorials , the average length ratio ( abstract / original ) was 30 % , and the coverage of the key sentence and the most important key sentence were 41 % and 60 % respectively .
