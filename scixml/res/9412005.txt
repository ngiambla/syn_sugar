 For reasons explained in the next section , the system converts these character-based representations to compact binary representations , using the number of bits in the binary string as a measure of size .
 Phonotactic rules can be used to restrict the segmentation hypothesis space by preventing word boundaries at certain places ; for instance , /ktspz/ ( `` cat 's paws '' ) has six internal segmentation points ( k tspz , k tspz , etc ) , only two of which are phonotactically allowed ( kt spz and kts pz ) .
 For example : In the binary representation , the two columns are represented separately , one after the other ; the first column is called the word inventory column ; the second column is called the code word inventory column .
 There are n fields ( one for each word ) , plus the unary prefix , so the combined length of the fields plus prefix ( plus terminating zero ) is : The total length of the word inventory column representation is the sum of the terms in , and .
 So , the length of the encoded sample is the sum of this formula over all words in the lexicon : The total length of the sample is given by adding the terms in and .
 As such , it permits direct comparison between competing hypotheses ; that is , the shorter the representation of some hypothesis , the more distributional information can be extracted and , therefore , the better the hypothesis .
 Phonotactic knowledge was given to the system as a list of licit initial and final consonant clusters of English words ; this list was checked against all six samples so that the list was maximally permissive ( e.g. , the underlined consonant cluster in explore could be divided as ek-splore or eks-plore ) .
