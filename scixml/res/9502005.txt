 Clearly then , the order of evaluation of the complements in a rule can profoundly influence the efficiency of generation , and an efficient head-driven generator must order the evaluation of the complements in a rule accordingly .
 Dynamic , on-line reordering can solve the ordering problem discussed in the previous subsection , but is rather unattractive : interpreting grammar rules at run time creates much overhead , and locally determining the optimal evaluation order is often impossible .
 As a result of the structure-sharing between the left-hand side of the rule and the auxiliary verb category , the - value of the auxiliary verb can be treated as bound , as well .
 In addition , the paths with a value of a maximal specific type for which there are no appropriate features specified , for example , the path cat , can be considered bound : On the basis of this annotated rule , we investigate the lexical entries defining its right-hand side categories .
 A potential problem for our approach constitutes the requirement that the phrase structure rules in the grammar need to have a particular degree of specificity for the generalization operation to be used successfully to mimic its evaluation .
 This is best illustrated on the basis of the following , more ` schematic ' , phrase structure rule : Underspecification of the head of the rule allows it to unify with both finite auxiliaries and finite ditransitive main verbs .
 In combination with the underspecification of the complements , this allows the rule not only to be used for argument composition constructions , as discussed above , but also for constructions in which a finite main verb becomes saturated .
