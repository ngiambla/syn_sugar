 The paper describes a substitutional approach to ellipsis resolution giving comparable results to Dalrymple et al. 1991 , but without the need for order-sensitive interleaving of quantifier scoping and ellipsis resolution .
 It is argued that the order-independence results from viewing semantic interpretation as building a description of a semantic composition , instead of the more common view of interpretation as actually performing the composition .
 Dalrymple et al. 1991 ( henceforth , DSP ) give an equational treatment of ellipsis via higher-order unification which , amongst other things , provides an insightful analysis of the interactions between ellipsis and quantification .
 A generalized quantifier representation equivalent to the above is The index in the scope node means that to semantically evaluate the QLF , you get hold of the quantifier , restriction and contextual restriction of the corresponding term .
 This forms a ( generalized ) quantifier expression , whose body is obtained by discharging all occurrences of the term and it index to a variable , and abstracting over the variable .
 Cashing out the substitutions for the first case , we have There is another scoping option which instantiates to , i.e. gives ` every house ' wide scope over both antecedent and ellipsis .
 In this case the two terms , in ellipsis and antecedent are both discharged ( i.e. bound ) at the scope node , rather than being separately bound at the two copies of . ( This has equivalent truth-conditions to ) .
