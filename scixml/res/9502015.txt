 When an intensional and an extensional verb are coordinated , the extensional verb must be type-raised to promote it to the type of the intensional verb : Again , this leads to the desired result .
 However , an unwelcome consequence of this approach , which appears to have gone unnoticed in the literature , arises in cases in which more than two verbs are conjoined .
 For instance , the meaning constructor for the verb supported is a glue language formula paraphrasable as : `` If my SUBJ means X and ( ) my OBJ means Y , then ( ) my sentence means '' .
 According to this axiom , if a set of paths G has meaning X , then for each R-relation that has been introduced , a resource can be produced .
 The linear logic operator ` ! ' allows the conclusion to be used as many times as necessary : once for each R-relation R ( F , P , G ) introduced by the f-structure .
 From R-relation ) and formula , we derive , giving the meaning of the subject of f The meaning constructor for supported combines with to derive the formula for bill-supported shown in .
 Similarly , using the meaning of NAFTA , R-relation , and Axiom I , we can derive the meaning shown in : and combine it with to derive : At each step , universal instantiation and modus ponens are used .
