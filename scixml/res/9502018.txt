 We describe a method for analysing the temporal structure of a discourse which takes into account the effects of tense , aspect , temporal adverbials and rhetorical structure and which minimises unnecessary ambiguity in the temporal structure .
 The method for building up the temporal structure of the discourse combines constraints and preferences : we use constraints to reduce the number of possible structures , exploiting the HPSG type hierarchy and unification for this purpose ; and we apply preferences to choose between the remaining options using a temporal centering mechanism .
 The goals of the temporal component were to yield a detailed representation of the temporal structure of the discourse , taking into account the effect of tense , aspect and temporal expressions while at the same time minimising unnecessary ambiguity in the temporal structure .
 The method combines a constraint-based approach with an approach based on preferences : we exploit the HPSG type hierarchy and unification to arrive at a temporal structure using constraints placed on that structure by tense , aspect , rhetorical structure and temporal expressions , and we use the temporal centering preferences described by Kameyama et al. 1993 , Poesio 1994 to rate the possibilities for temporal structure and choose the best among them .
 Table lists the possible temporal relations between the eventualities described by two consecutive sentences without temporal expressions or cue words , where the first sentence ( S ) may have any tense and aspect and the second sentence ( S ) expresses a simple past event .
 For example , if a simple past eventive sentence follows a simple past eventive sentence the second event can be understood to occur just after the first , to precede the first or to refer to the same event as the first ( an elaboration relation ) , but the two events cannot overlap ; these constraints are weaker , however , than explicit clues such as cue words to rhetorical relations and temporal expressions .
 Using this algorithm , we can precisely identify the rhetorical and temporal relations when cue words to rhetorical structure are present , as in : We can also narrow the possibilities when no cue word is present by using constraints based on observations of tense and aspect interactions such as those shown in Table .
