 This problem has been previously analyzed in de Swart 1991 as an instance of the proportion problem , and given a solution from a Generalized Quantifier approach .
 By using a careful distinction between the different notions of reference time , based on Kamp and Reyle 1993 , we propose a solution to this problem , within the framework of DRT .
 The mechanism used to account for this phenomena in Hinrichs 1986 and Partee 1984 , is based on the notion of reference time , originally proposed by Reichenbach 1947 .
 Reichenbach 's well - known account of the interpretation of the different tense forms uses the temporal relations between three temporal indices : the utterance time , event time and reference time .
 The tense morpheme of the main clause locates the event time with respect to the reference time , whereas temporal adverbials are used to locate the reference time .
 A sentence such as which is the same as sentence , except the ` whenever ' is replaced by ` when ' , and ` always ' is added in the main clause , would get the same DRS .
 As noted in Partee 1984 , this analysis does not extend in a straightforward manner to cases in which the operator when is replaced by ( an unrestricted ) before or after , in such quantified contexts .
