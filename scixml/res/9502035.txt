 Unconscious garden paths , on the other hand , such as , cause reanalysis which is experimentally detectable , but which is generally not `` noticed '' by the speaker or hearer .
 Gorrell employs the D-theoretic device of building up a set of dominance and precedence relations between nodes , where the set is intended to be constrained by informational monotonicity , in that once asserted to the set , no relation may be deleted or overridden .
 Recall , repeated below : At the point where John knows the truth has been processed , a complete clause will have been built : The description will include the information that the verb knows precedes NP , and that the VP dominates NP .
 On the assumption that saw selects for a PP instrumental argument , we can derive this preference in the present model via the preference to attach as an argument as opposed to an adjunct .
 However , since we are constrained by incrementality , we will have to make an attachment decision for the PP as soon as the preposition with is encountered , and it will be attached in the preferred reading as a sister of the verb .
 This means that , in cases such as , where , on the globally acceptable reading , the PP is an adjunct of the NP the man , this attachment will have to be revised , and the PP retrospectively adjoined into the relevant N ' node .
 However , once the preposition with has been attached , the required N ' node will no longer be accessible , and a conscious garden path effect will be predicted , which , intuitively , does not occur .
