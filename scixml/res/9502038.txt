 I argue that although the overall performance of these models for German is comparable to results for English and French , a more exact analysis demonstrates important differences in the types of disambiguation involved for German .
 Despite this fact , little work has been done so far toward employing this technology for the disambiguation of German texts Wothke et al. 1993 , Schmid and Kempe 1995 .
 In addition a number of these forms may also be used as finite verbs ( i.e. erhalten , gehrt ) , and this is a further source of errors .
 Almost all of the remaining errors are misassignments within closed classes , including well-known errors due to long distance phenomena , such as those resulting from the confusion of relative pronouns , demonstrative pronouns and articles in sentences like : die einmal fr die Buchproduktion erfaten Texte or : doch der wollte nicht , das falle auf .
 The latter , however , greatly hinders the recognition of proper nouns , the most common type of error , responsible for approximately of the model 's mistakes .
 It is important to notice that the types of disambiguation carried out by the tagger for German are significantly different from the disambiguation work for English and French .
 While in English and French a fair number of disambiguations involve separating major POS classes such as verb , noun , and adjective , most of the work performed in the German model involves disambiguation between subclasses of one main category , such as finite vs. infinitive verb , noun vs. proper noun , different sub-categories of pronouns , etc .
