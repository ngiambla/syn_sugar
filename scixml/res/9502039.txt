 Tested for french , english , spanish and german discrimination , the system gives very interesting results , achieving in one test 99.4 % correct assignments on real sentences .
 Having the grammatical words and the alphabet of each language at its disposal , the system computes for each of them its likelihood to be selected .
 Tagging sentences with the name of their language solves this problem by switching each application in function of the language .
 This affects the whole NLP , Information retrieval is not the only field to be concerned : syntactic analysis and every applications based on it are concerned , making study about one particular language in multilingual texts without parasitic noise is also possible .
 There are two levels to improve sentences categorization : a level below using words morphology and a level above using text structure .
 Mainly two ways can be explore to improve categorization , using natural languages properties : Syllabation : the idea is to check the good syllabation of words in a language .
 It requires to distinguish first , middles and last syllabs . ( Using only endings seems to be a possible way ) Sequences of voyells or consonants : the idea is that these sequences are proper to each language .
