 The first step in the analysis , the computation of linguistic distance between each pair of sites , can be computed as Levenshtein distance between phonetic strings .
 This correlates closely with the much more laborious technique of determining and counting isoglosses , and is more accurate than the more familiar metric of computing Hamming distance based on whether vocabulary entries match .
 More recently , the field of dialectometry , as introduced by Sguy 1971 , Sguy 1973 , has addressed these issues by developing several techniques for summarizing and presenting variation along multiple dimensions .
 They replace isoglosses with a distance matrix , which compares each site directly with all other sites , ultimately yielding a single figure that measures the linguistic distances between each pair of sites .
 To form a baseline for comparison , I analysed the distribution of each of the 51 plotted concepts , finding a total of 3,337 features by which two or more sites differed .
 For example , for the concept ` sell ' , I identified two sets , one using the word dol ( most sites in Ireland ) , and one using the word creic ( Rathlin Island , the Isle of Man , and Scotland ) .
 Instead I distinguished them on the basis of twelve phonetic features that systematically account for all of the distinctions in Wagner 's inventory : nasality , stricture , laterality , articulator , glottis , place , palatalization , rounding , length , height , strength , and syllabicity .
