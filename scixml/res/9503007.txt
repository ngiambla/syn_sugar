 We focus on the spatial and the temporal intrinsic semantic properties of the motion verbs , on the one hand , and of the spatial prepositions , on the other hand .
 Most of natural languages provide two types of lexical items to describe the motion of an entity with respect to some location : motion verbs ( to run ; to enter ) and spatial prepositions ( from ; towards ) .
 Motion verbs can be used directly with a location , when they are transitive ( to cross the town ) or with a spatial preposition , when they are intransitive ( to go through the town ) .
 The latter case is more interesting : most of the French motion verbs are intransitive and the interaction between motion verbs and spatial prepositions gives detailed informations about the way human beeings mentally represent spatiotemporal aspects of a motion .
 We have realized a systematic and fine linguistic study on these verbs , looking carefully at each of them , one by one ( and we have 440 CoL verbs in French ) , in order to extract their intrinsic spatiotemporal properties .
 This space , induced by the lref , is characterized by most of the authors in the literature by a two-part spatial system consisting in the inside and the outside of the lref .
 We propose to refine this structure with two new concepts , required to distinguish minimal pairs like sortir ( to go out ) / partir ( to leave ) , and entrer ( to enter ) / atterir ( to land ) .
