 This paper is concerned with symmetrical coordination , where the order of the conjuncts ( the items being coordinated by a conjunction such as and or or ) can be altered without affecting acceptability .
 Coordination of this kind is traditionally split into constituent coordination , where each conjunct forms a constituent according to ` standard ' phrase structure grammars , and non-constituent coordination .
 For example , consider : In example the two prepositions are attached differently , one to the verb saw , the other to the noun , man .
 In example , attributed to Paul Dekker , the two conjuncts require Mary 's handbag to have a different syntactic structure : the bracketing appropriate for the first conjunct is [ [ a friend of Mary ] 's handbag ] .
 The unacceptability of these examples suggests that word by word identity is insufficient , and that deleted material must have identical syntactic structure , as well as identical lexical meanings .
 For example , Lakoff and Peters 1969 argued that deletion accounts are inappropriate for certain constituent coordinations such as : since the ` antecedent ' sentence John are alike and Mary are alike is nonsensical ( it is also ungrammatical if we consider number agreement ) .
 This account makes reasonably good empirical predictions , though it does fail for the following examples : In , each conjunct contains different numbers of modifiers of different types ( an adverbial phrase with two prepositional phrases ) .
