 It also includes a discussion of some of the issues which arise when parsing lexicalised grammars , and the possibilities for using statistical techniques for tuning to particular languages .
 There is a large body of psycholinguistic evidence which suggests that meaning can be extracted before the end of a sentence , and before the end of phrasal constituents Marslen-Wilson 1973 , Tanenhaus et al. 1990 .
 In CGs which contain functions of functions ( such as very , or slowly ) , the addition of composition adds both new analyses of sentences , and new strings to the language .
 This is due to the fact that composition can be used to form a function , which can then be used as an argument to a function of a function .
 For example , if the two types , n / n and n / n are composed to give the type n / n , then this can be modified by an adjectival modifier of type ( n / n ) / ( n / n ) .
 When we consider full sentence processing , as opposed to incremental processing , the use of lexicalised grammars has a major advantage over the use of more standard rule based grammars .
 In processing a sentence using a lexicalised formalism we do not have to look at the grammar as a whole , but only at the grammatical information indexed by each of the words .
