 In this paper , I propose a model of the role of informationally redundant utterances in providing evidence to support inferences about mutual understanding and acceptance .
 This schema means that when A says u to B intending to convey p , that this leads to the mutual belief that B understands u as p under certain assumptions .
 The assumptions are that A and B were copresent , that B was attending to the utterance event , that B heard the utterance , and that B believes that the utterance u realizes the intended meaning p .
 Consider the following excerpt : Harry 's utterance of is said with a falling intonational contour and hence is unlikely to be a question .
 This utterance results in an instantiation of the inference rule as follows : In this case , the belief about understanding is supported by linguistic evidence since all of the supporting assumptions are supported by linguistic evidence .
 IRU 's such as PROMPTS , REPETITIONS , PARAPHRASES , and making an INFERENCE explicit cannot function as evidence for conflicts in beliefs or intentions via their propositional content since they are informationally redundant .
 In the dialogue below between Harry ( h ) and Ruth ( r ) , Ruth in , first ensures that she understood Harry correctly , and then provides explicit evidence of non-acceptance in , based on her autonomous preferences about how her money is invested .
