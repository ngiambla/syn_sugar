 This approach bears comparison with probabilistic systems , but has the advantage that negative as well as positive information can be modelled .
 Also , most computation is done in advance , when the nets are trained , so the run time computational load is low .
 The well known complexity of parsing is addressed by decomposing the problem , and then locating one syntactic constituent at a time .
 In the same way that tags are allocated to words , or to punctuation marks , they can represent the boundaries of syntactic constituents , such as noun phrases and verb phrases .
 Though the form in which the vector is written may give an illusion of representing order , no sequential order is maintained .
 Multi-layer networks , which can process linearly inseparable data , were also investigated , but are not necessary for this particular processing task .
 The difference between the `` yes '' and `` no '' activation levels is recorded for each string , and this score is considered a measure of grammaticality , .
