 The results for English are surprisingly low ( for example , on the Penn treebank , the tagger gives an accuracy of 95 - 96 % ) , and may be due to long sequences of ambiguous words .
 The figures include the degree of ambiguity , that is , the number of words in the corpus for which more than one tag was hypothesised .
 The accuracy is plotted against the size of the tagset in figures - , where the numbers on the points correspond to the index of tagsets listed .
 French Clustered , with an accuracy on all tagsets which do not mark gender of around 96 % - 96.5 % ; when gender is marked 94 % - 94.5 % .
 The sizes of the tagsets ranged from approximately 80 - 200 tags for Swedish , 35 - 90 for French , and 70 - 160 for English .
 As discussed above , it is not clear what would happen with larger tagsets , but some experiments based on the Susanne corpus and using tagsets ranging from 236 to 425 tags suggest that the trend to higher accuracy continues with even bigger tagsets .
 In the second experiment , the test corpora included `` unknown '' words , which had not been seen during training , and for which the tagger hypothesises all open-class tags .
