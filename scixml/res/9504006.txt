 We then go on to address how conversational participants co-ordinate moves between these higher level units , in particular looking at the ways they use to signal the beginning and end of such high level units .
 Previous research has identified three means by which speakers signal information about discourse structure to listeners : Cue words and phrases Grosz and Sidner 1986 , Reichman 1985 ; Intonation Hirschberg and Pierrehumbert 1986 ; Pronominalisation Guidon et al. 1986 , Brennan et al. 1987 .
 In the cue words approach , Reichman 1985 has claimed that phrases like `` because '' , `` so '' , and `` but '' offer explicit information to listeners about how the speaker 's current contribution to the discourse relates to what has gone previously .
 For example a speaker might use the expression `` so '' to signal that s / he is about to conclude what s / he has just said .
 We suggest the following two principles might account for interruptions : these principles concern : the information upon which the participants are basing their plans , and the plans themselves .
 Information quality : Both expert and client must believe that the information that the expert has about the problem is true and that this information is sufficient to solve the problem .
 This can be expressed by the following two rules which concern the truth of the information and the ambiguity of the information : if the listener believes a fact P and believes that fact to be relevant and either believes that the speaker believes not P or that the speaker does not know P then interrupt ; If the listener believes that the speaker 's assertion is relevant but ambiguous then interrupt .
