 Previous studies of the discourse structure of multi-participant dialogues have often factored out the role of MIXED-INITIATIVE , by allocating control to one participant Grosz 1977 , Cohen 1984 , or by assuming a passive listener McKeown 1985, Cohen 1987 .
 We model mixed-initiative using an utterance type classification and a set of rules for transfer of control between discourse participants that were proposed by Whittaker and Stenton 1988 .
 We evaluate the generality of this analysis by applying the control rules to 4 sets of dialogues , including both advisory dialogues ( ADs ) and task-oriented dialogues ( TODs ) .
 The rules for the allocation of control are based on the utterance type classification and allow a dialogue to be divided into segments that correspond to which speaker is the controller of the segment .
 The claim is that shifts of control often do not occur until the controller indicates the end of a discourse segment by abdicating or producing a repetition / summary .
 To determine the relationship between the derived control segments and ATTENTIONAL STATE we looked at the distribution of anaphora with respect to the control segments in the ADs .
 When we look at the different types of anaphora , we find that third person and one anaphors cross boundaries extremely rarely , but the event anaphors and the deictic pronouns demonstrate a different pattern .
