 For example , Hirschberg 1985 has shown that in order to understand a scalar implicature , one must analyze the conversants ' beliefs and intentions .
 One way of accounting for cancellations that occur later in the analyzed text is simply to extend the boundaries within which pragmatic inferences are evaluated , i.e. , to look ahead a few utterances .
 Mercer 1987 formalizes presuppositions in a logical framework that handles defaults Reiter 1980 , but this approach is not tractable and it treats natural disjunction as an exclusive-or and implication as logical equivalence .
 Computational approaches fail to account for the cancellation of pragmatic inferences : once presuppositions Weischedel 1979 or implicatures Hirschberg 1985 , Green 1992 are generated , they can never be cancelled .
 We are not aware of any formalism or computational approach that offers a unified explanation for the cancellability of pragmatic inferences in general , and of no approach that handles cancellations that occur in sequences of utterances .
 It is the role of context and knowledge of the conversants to `` decide '' whether that inference will survive or not as a pragmatic inference of the structure .
 We put no boundaries upon the time when such a cancellation can occur , and we offer a unified explanation for pragmatic inferences that are inferable when simple utterances , complex utterances , or sequences of utterances are considered .
