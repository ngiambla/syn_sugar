 The difficulties in morphological analysis and error detection in Semitic arise from the following facts : Non-Linearity A Semitic stem consists of a root and a vowel melody , arranged according to a canonical pattern .
 For example , the glottal stop [ ' 145 ] at the end of a stem may become [ w ] when followed by the relative adjective morpheme { iyy } , as in Arabic /samaa + iyy/ /samaawiyy/ ` heavenly ' , but /hawaa + iyy/ /hawaa ' 145 iyy/ ` of air ' .
 Morphosyntactic Issues In broken plurals , diminutives and deverbal nouns , the user may enter a morphologically sound , but morphosyntactically ill-formed word .
 If no error rules succeed , or lead to a successful partition of the word , analysis backtracks to try the error rules at successively earlier points in the word .
 For purposes of simplicity and because on the whole is it likely that words will contain no more than one error Damerau 1964 , Pollock and Zamora 1983 , normal ` no error ' analysis usually resumes if an error rule succeeds .
 Once an error rule is selected , the corrected surface is substituted for the error surface , and normal analysis continues - at the same position .
 The substituted surface may be in the form of a variable , which is then ground by the normal analysis sequence of lexical matching over the lexicon tree .
