 Therein , the procedure is stated in terms of calls to an oracle which can determine if a noun compound is acceptable .
 It is reproduced here for reference : Given three nouns , and : If either [ ] or [ ] is not semantically acceptable then build the alternative structure ; otherwise , if [ ] is semantically preferable to [ ] then build [ ] ; otherwise , build [ ] .
 After some tuning , the accuracy was about 73 % , as compared with a baseline of 64 % achieved by always bracketing the first two nouns together .
 This model utilises the following procedure when given three nouns , and : Determine how acceptable the structures [ ] and [ ] are ; if the latter is more acceptable , build [ ] first ; otherwise , build [ ] first .
 Eight different training schemes have been used to estimate the parameters and each set of estimates used to analyse the test set under both the adjacency and the dependency model .
 The schemes used are : the pattern given in section ; and windowed training schemes with window widths of 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 10 , 50 and 100 words .
 To determine the difference made by conceptual association , the pattern training scheme has been retrained using lexical counts for both the dependency and adjacency model , but only for the words in the test set .
