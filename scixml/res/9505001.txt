 Although agents involved in argumentation and non-collaborative negotiation take other agents ' beliefs into consideration , they do so mainly to find weak points in their opponents ' beliefs and attack them to win the argument .
 In our earlier work , we built on Sidner 's proposal / acceptance and proposal / rejection sequences Sidner 1994 and developed a model that captures collaborative planning processes in a Propose-Evaluate-Modify cycle of actions Chu-Carroll and Carberry 1994 .
 This model views collaborative planning as agent A proposing a set of actions and beliefs to be incorporated into the shared plan being developed , agent B evaluating the proposal to determine whether or not he accepts the proposal and , if not , agent B proposing a set of modifications to A 's original proposal .
 If the combined evidence is still predicted to fail , the system does not have sufficient evidence to change the user 's view of _bel ; thus , the focus of modification for _bel is nil ( step ) .
 Notice that steps and of the algorithm invoke a function , Predict , that makes use of the belief revision mechanism Galliers 1992 discussed in Section to predict the user 's acceptance or unacceptance of _bel based on the system 's knowledge of the user 's beliefs and the evidence that could be presented to him Logan et al. 1994 .
 Once a set of beliefs forming justification chains is identified , the system must then select from this set those belief chains which , when presented to the user , are predicted to convince the user of _bel .
 Our system will first construct a singleton set for each such justification chain and select the sets containing justification which , when presented , is predicted to convince the user of _bel .
