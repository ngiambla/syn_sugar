 The final CCG rule to be considered is the coordination rule that specifies that only like categories can coordinate : This is actually a schema for a family of rules , collectively called `` generalized coordination '' , since the semantic rule is different for each case .
 For example , if X is a unary function , then the semantic rule is , and if the functions have two arguments , then the rule is .
 For example , when processing , rule would be used with : with the result which is - equivalent to . -Prolog is a logic programming language based on higher-order hereditary Harrop formulae Miller et al. 1991 .
 Thus , for the query R unifies with the function , S with harry ' and M with ( R S ) , the meta-level application of R to S , which by the built-in - reduction is .
 Consider again the derivation of harry found by type-raising and forward composition . harry would get type-raised by the raise clause to produce , and then composed with found , with the result shown in the following query : At this point a further - reduction is needed .
 The operational semantics for -Prolog state that is provable if and only if [ c / x ] G is provable , where c is a new variable of the same type as x that does not otherwise occur in the current signature .
 Since c is meant to be treated as a generic placeholder for any arbitrary x of the proper type , c must not appear in any terms instantiated for logic variables during the proof of [ c / x ] G .
