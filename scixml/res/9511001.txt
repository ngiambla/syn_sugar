 Incorporating this method into the machine translation system ALT-J / E , helped to raise the percentage of noun phrases generated with correct use of articles and number from 65 % to 73 .
 Where `` the phrase ` falls within the scope [ or domain ] of a denumerator ' means ` is denumerated ' by it ; i. e the NP reference is quantified by the denumerator as a number of discrete entities . '' .
 In particular , noun phrases whose heads fall within the scope of a denumerator ( ` denumerated ' noun phrases ) must be headed by a noun that has both singular and plural forms .
 Unless explicitly indicated , they will be treated the same as their supersets . ` Collective ' nouns share all the properties of fully countable nouns .
 In addition they can have singular or plural verb agreement with the singular form of the noun : The government has / have decided . ` Semi-countable ' nouns share the properties of uncountable nouns , except that they can be modified directly by a / an ; for example a knowledge [ of Japanese ] .
 If an elephant is referred to not as an individual elephant but as a source of meat , then it will be expressed in an uncountable noun phrase : ` I ate a slice of elephant ' .
 To generate this the following rule is used : `` nouns quantified with the classifier kire `` slice '' will be generated as the prepositional complement of slice , they will be singular with no article unless they are pluralia tanta , when they will be plural with no article '' .
