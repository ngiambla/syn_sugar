 For example , the similarity between linguistics and stylistics , both are the extra words , is computed as follows : Obviously , both and , where W is an extra word and w is not , are also computable .
 This section discusses the nature of the structure and states of Paradigme , and also the nature of the similarity computed on it .
 The set of all the possible activated patterns produced on Paradigme can be considered as a semantic space where each state is represented as a point .
 The similarity between words is computed by spreading activation on the semantic network Paradigme which is systematically constructed from a subset of the English dictionary LDOCE .
 Paradigme can directly compute the similarity between any two words in LDV , and indirectly the similarity of all the other words in LDOCE .
 It can be applied to computing the similarity between texts , and measuring the cohesiveness of a text which suggests coherence of the text , as we have seen in Section .
 And , we are now applying it to text segmentation Grosz and Sidner 1986 , Youmans 1991 , i.e. to capture the shifts of coherent scenes in a story .
