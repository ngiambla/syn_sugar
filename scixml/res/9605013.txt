 Thus , provision of an effective method of learning dependencies between case slots , as well as investigation of the usefulness of the acquired dependencies in disambiguation and other natural language processing tasks would be an important contribution to the field .
 In this paper , we view the problem of learning case frame patterns as that of learning a multi-dimensional discrete joint distribution , where random variables represent case slots .
 For example , the data in Figure can be generated by a word-based model , and the data in Figure by a class-based model .
 Suppose for simplicity that there are only 4 possible case slots corresponding respectively to the subject , direct object , ` from ' phrase , and ` to ' phrase .
 Without loss of generality , any n-dimensional joint distribution can be written as for some permutation ( ) of 1,2 , .. , n , where we let denote .
 Figure shows the detail of this algorithm , where denotes the number of possible values assumed by , N the input data size , and denotes the logarithm to the base 2 .
 It is easy to see that the number of parameters in a dendroid distribution is of the order , where k is the maximum of all , and n is the number of random variables , and the time complexity of the algorithm is of the order .
