 The relative pronoun which would , for instance , receive category with being implication in LP , i.e. , it requires as an argument `` an s lacking an np somewhere '' .
 Let us define the polarity of a subformula of a sequent as follows : A has positive polarity , each of have negative polarity and if B / C or has polarity p , then B also has polarity p and C has the opposite polarity of p in the sequent .
 A consequence of only allowing the rule , which is easily proved by induction , is that in any derivable sequent may only appear in positive polarity .
 Hence , may not occur in the ( cut ) formula A of a application and any subformula which occurs somewhere in the prove must also occur in the final sequent .
 When we assume the final sequent 's RHS to be primitive ( or - less ) , then the rule will be used exactly once for each ( positively ) occuring - subformula .
 Given a grammar G and a string , the parsing ( or recognition ) problem asks the question , whether w is in L(G) .
 It is not immediately obvious , how the generative capacity of SDL-grammars relate to Lambek grammars or nondirectional Lambek grammars ( based on calculus LP ) .
