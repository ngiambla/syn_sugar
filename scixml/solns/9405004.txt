 The previously proposed semantic-head-driven generation methods run into problems if none of the daughter constituents in the syntacto-semantic rule schemata of a grammar fits the definition of a semantic head given in Shieber et al. 1990 . 
 This is the case for the semantic analysis rules of certain constraint-based semantic representations , e.g. Underspecified Discourse Representation Structures ( UDRSs ) Frank and Reyle 1992 . 
 Since head-driven generation in general has its merits , we simply return to a syntactic definition of ` head ' and demonstrate the feasibility of syntactic-head-driven generation . 
 In addition to its generality , a syntactic-head-driven algorithm provides a basis for a logically well-defined treatment of the movement of ( syntactic ) heads , for which only ad-hoc solutions existed , so far .
