 Vijay-Shanker and Weir 1993 show that Linear Indexed Grammars ( LIG ) can be processed in polynomial time by exploiting constraints which make possible the extensive use of structure-sharing . 
 This paper describes a formalism that is more powerful than LIG , but which can also be processed in polynomial time using similar techniques . 
 The formalism , which we refer to as Partially Linear PATR ( PLPATR ) manipulates feature structures rather than stacks .
