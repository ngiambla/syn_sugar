 Despite the large amount of theoretical work done on non-constituent coordination during the last two decades , many computational systems still treat coordination using adapted parsing strategies , in a similar fashion to the SYSCONJ system developed for ATNs . 
 This paper reviews the theoretical literature , and shows why many of the theoretical accounts actually have worse coverage than accounts based on processing . 
 Finally , it shows how processing accounts can be described formally and declaratively in terms of Dynamic Grammars .
