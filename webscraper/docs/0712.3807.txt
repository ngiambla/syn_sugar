In this paper, we propose a spreading activation approach for collaborative  ltering (SA-
CF). By using the opinion spreading process, the similarity between any users can be
obtained. The algorithm has remarkably higher accuracy than the standard collaborative
 ltering (CF) using Pearson correlation. Furthermore, we introduce a free parameter  
to regulate the contributions of objects to user-user correlations. The numerical results
indicate that decreasing the in uence of popular objects can further improve the algorith-
mic accuracy and personality. We argue that a better algorithm should simultaneously
require less computation and generate higher accuracy. Accordingly, we further propose
an algorithm involving only the top-N similar neighbors for each target user, which has
both less computational complexity and higher algorithmic accuracy.

1. Introduction
With the advent of the Internet, the exponential growth of the World-Wide-Web and
routers confront people with an information overload 1. We are facing too much data
to be able to e ectively  lter out the pieces of information that are most appropriate
for us. A promising way is to provide personal recommendations to  lter out the
information. Recommendation systems use the opinions of users to help them more
e ectively identify content of interest from a potentially overwhelming set of choices
2. Motivated by the practical signi cance to the e-commerce and society, various
kinds of algorithms have been proposed, such as correlation-based methods 3,4,
content-based methods 5,6, the spectral analysis 7,8, principle component analysis

9, network-based methods 10,11,12,13, and so on. For a review of current progress,
see Ref. 14 and the references therein.
One of the most successful technologies for recommendation systems, called col-
laborative  ltering (CF), has been developed and extensively investigated over the
past decade 3,4,15. When predicting the potential interests of a given user, such
approach  rst identi es a set of similar users from the past records and then makes
a prediction based on the weighted combination of those similar users  opinions.
Despite its wide applications, collaborative  ltering su ers from several major lim-
itations including system scalability and accuracy 16. Recently, some physical dy-
namics, including mass di usion 12,11, heat conduction 10 and trust-based model
17, have found their applications in personal recommendations. These physical ap-
proaches have been demonstrated to be of both high accuracy and low computa-
tional complexity 10,12,11. However, the algorithmic accuracy and computational
complexity may be very sensitive to the statistics of data sets. For example, the
algorithm presented in Ref. 12 runs much faster than standard CF if the number
of users is much larger than that of objects, while when the number of objects is
huge, the advantage of this algorithm vanishes because its complexity is mainly de-
termined by the number of objects (see Ref. 12 for details). In order to increase the
system scalability and accuracy of standard CF, we introduce a network-based rec-
ommendation algorithm with spreading activation, namely SA-CF. In addition, two
free parameters,   and N are presented to increase the accuracy and personality.
2. Method
Denoting the object set as O = {o1, o2,       , on} and user set as U = {u1, u2,       ,
um}, a recommendation system can be fully described by an adjacent matrix A =
{aij}   Rn,m, where aij = 1 if oi is collected by uj, and aij = 0 otherwise. For
a given user, a recommendation algorithm generates a ranking of all the objects
he/she has not collected before.
Based on the user-object matrix A, a user similarity network can be constructed,
where each node represents a user, and two users are connected if and only if
they have collected at least one common object. In the standard CF, the similarity
between ui and uj can be evaluated directly by a correlation function:
ij = Pn
sc
l=1 alialj
min{k(ui), k(uj)}
,
(1)
where k(ui) = Pn
l=1 ali is the degree of user ui. Inspired by the di usion process
presented by Zhou et al. 12, we assume a certain amount of resource (e.g. recom-
mendation power) is associated with each user, and the weight sij represents the
proportion of the resource, which uj would like to distribute to ui. Following a
network-based resource-allocation process 18 where each user distributes his/her
initial resource equally to all the objects he/she has collected, and then each object
sends back what it has received to all the users collected it, the weight sij (the

fraction of initial resource uj eventually gives to ui) can be expressed as:
sij =
1
k(uj)
n
X
l=1
alialj
k(ol)
,
(2)
where k(ol) = Pm
i=1 ali denotes the degree object ol. Using the spreading process,
the user correlation network can be constructed, whose edge weight is obtained by
Eq. (2). For the user-object pair (ui, oj), if ui has not yet collected oj (i.e. aji = 0),
the predicted score, vij , is given as
vij = Pm
l=1,l6=i sliajl
Pm
l=1,l6=i sli
.
(3)
From the de nition of Eq.(3), one can get that, to a target user, all of his neighbors 
collection information would a ect the recommendation results, which is di erent
with the de nition reachability 20. Based on the de nitions of sij and vij , SA-CF
can be given. The framework of the algorithm is organized as follows: (I) Calculate
the user similarity matrix {sij} based on the spreading approach; (II) For each
user i, obtain the score vij on every object not being yet collected by j; (III) Sort
the uncollected objects in descending order of vij , and those in the top will be
recommended.
3. Numerical results
To test the algorithmic accuracy and personality, we use a benchmark data-set,
namely MovieLens 19. The data consists of 1682 movies (objects) and 943 users,
who vote movies using discrete ratings 1-5. Hence we applied the coarse-graining
method previously used in Refs. 12,13: A movie is set to be collected by a user
only if the giving rating is larger than 2. The original data contains 105 ratings,
85.25% of which are   3, thus the user-object (user-movie) bipartite network after
the coarse gaining contains 85250 edges. To test the recommendation algorithms,
the data set is randomly divided into two parts: the training set contains 90% of
the data, and the remaining 10% of data constitutes the probe. The training set is
treated as known information, while no information in the probe set is allowed to
be used for prediction.
A recommendation algorithm should provide each user with an ordered queue of
all its uncollected objects. It should be emphasized that, the length of queue should
not be given arti cially, because of the fact that the number of uncollected movies
for di erent users are di erent. For an arbitrary user ui, if the relation ui-oj is in
the probe set (according to the training set, oj is an uncollected object for ui), we
measure the position of oj in the ordered queue. For example, if there are Li = 100
uncollected movies for ui, and oj is the 10th from the top, we say the position of
oj is 10/Li, denoted by rij = 0.1. Since the probe entries are actually collected
by users, a good algorithm is expected to give high recommendations to them,
thus leading to small rij . Therefore, the mean value of the position rij , hri (called

ijmpc
4 Jian-Guo Liu et. al.
ranking score 12), averaged over all the entries in the probe, can be used to evaluate
the algorithmic accuracy: the smaller the ranking score, the higher the algorithmic
accuracy, and vice verse. Implementing the SA-CF and CF 21, the average value
of ranking score are 0.12187   0.02406 and 0.13069   0.0571 22. Clearly, under
the simplest initial con guration, subject to the algorithmic accuracy, the SA-CF
algorithm outperforms the standard CF.
4. Two modi ed algorithms
In order to further improve the algorithmic accuracy, we propose two modi ed
methods. Similar to the Ref. 13, taking into account the potential role of object
degree may give better performance. Accordingly, instead of Eq. (2), we introduce
a more complicated way to get user-user correlation:
sij =
1
k(uj)
m
X
l=1
alialj
k (ol)
,
(4)
where   is a tunable parameter. When   = 1, this method degenerates to the algo-
rithm mentioned in the last section. The case with   > 1 weakens the contribution
of large-degree objects to the user-user correlation, while   < 1 will enhance the

contribution of large-degree objects. According to our daily experience, if two users
ui and uj has simultaneously collected a very popular object (with very large de-
gree), it doesn t mean that their interests are similar; on the contrary, if two users
both collected an unpopular object (with very small degree), it is very likely that
they share some common and particular tastes. Therefore, we expect a larger   (i.e.
  > 1) will lead to higher accuracy than the routine case   = 1.
Fig.1 reports the algorithmic accuracy as a function of  . The curve has a clear
minimum around   = 1.9, which strongly support the above statement. Compared
with the routine case (  = 1), the ranking score can be further reduced by 11.2% at
the optimal value. It is indeed a great improvement for recommendation algorithms.
Besides accuracy, the average degree of all recommended movies hki and the mean
value of Hamming distance S 13 are taken in account to measure the algorithmic
personality. The movies with higher degrees are more popular than the ones with
smaller degrees. The personal recommendation should give small hki to  t the spe-
cial tastes of di erent users. Fig.2 reports the average degree of all recommended
movies as a function of  . One can see from  g.2 that the average degree is nega-
tively correlated with  , thus depressing the recommendation power of high-degree
objects gives more opportunity to the unpopular objects. The Hamming distance,

S = hHij i, is de ned by the mean value among any two recommended lists of ui
and uj, where Hij = 1   Q/L, L is the list length and Q is the overlapped number of
objects in the two users  recommended lists. Fig.3 shows the positively correlation
between S and  , in according with the simulation results in  g.2, which indicates
that depressing the in uence of high-degree objects makes the recommendations
more personal. The above simulation results indicate that SA-CF outperforms CF
from the viewpoints of accuracy and personality.
Besides the algorithmic accuracy and personality, the computational complex-
ity should also be taken into account. Actually, we argue that a better algorithm
should simultaneously require less computation and generate higher accuracy. Note
that, the computational complexity of Eq. (3) is very high if the number of user, m,
is huge. Actually, the majority of user-user similarities are very small, which con-
tribute little to the  nal recommendation. However, those inconsequential items,
corresponding to the less similar users, dominate the computational time of Eq.
(3). Therefore, we propose a modi ed algorithm, so-called top-N SA-CF, which
only considers the N most similar users  information to any given user. That is to
say, in the top-N SA-CF, the sum in Eq. (3) runs over only the N most similar
users of ui. In the process of calculation the similarity matrix sij , to each other,
we can simultaneously record its most similar users. When m   N , the additional

computing time for top-N similar users are remarkably shorter than what we can
save from the traditional calculation of Eq. (3). More surprisingly, as shown in Fig.4,
with properly chosen N , this algorithm not only reduces the computation, but also
enhances the algorithmic accuracy. This property is of practical signi cance, espe-
cially for the huge-size recommender systems. From  gures 2 and 3, one can  nd
that, to the same   range, the anticorrelations between hki, S and   are di erent in
di erent   range. Maybe there is a phase transition in the anticorrelations. Because
this paper mainly focuses on the accuracy and personality of the recommendation
algorithms, this issue would be investigated in the future.
5. Conclusions
In this paper, the spreading activation approach is presented to compute the user
similarity of the collaborative  ltering algorithm, named SA-CF. The basic SA-
CF has obviously higher accuracy than the standard CF. Ignoring the degree-
degree correlation in user-object relations, the algorithmic complexity of SA-CF
is O(mhkuihkoi + mnhkoi), where hkui and hkoi denote the average degree of users
and objects. Correspondingly, the algorithmic complexity of the standard CF is
O(m2hkui + mnhkoi), where the  rst term accounts for the calculation of similarity
between users, and the second term accounts for the calculation of the predictions.

In reality, the number of users, m, is much larger than the average object degree,
hkoi, therefore, the computational complexity of SA-CF is much less than that of
the standard CF. The SA-CF has great potential signi cance in practice.
Furthermore, we proposed two modi ed algorithms based on SA-CF. The  rst
algorithm weakens the contribution of large-degree objects to user-user correlations,
and the second one eliminates the in uence of less similar users. Both the two
modi ed algorithm can further enhance the accuracy of SA-CF. More signi cantly,
with properly choice of the parameter N , top-N SA-CF can simultaneously reduces
the computational complexity and improves the algorithmic accuracy.
A natural question on the presented algorithms is whether these algorithms are
robust to other data-sets or random recommendation? To SA-CF, the answer is
yes, because it would get the user similarity more accurately. While to the two
modi ed algorithms, the answer is no. Since both of the two modi ed algorithms
introduced the tunable parameters   and N , the optimal values of di erent data-sets
are di erent. The further work would focus on how to  nd an e ective way to obtain
the optimal value exactly, then the modi ed algorithms could be implemented more
easily.

22. Note that, the ranking score of the standard CF reported here is slightly di erent from
that of the Ref. 12. It is because in this paper, if a movie in the probe set has not yet
appeared in the known set, we automatically remove it from the probe; while the Ref.
12 takes into account those movies only appeared in the probe via assigning zero score
to them. Another alterative way is to automatically move those movies from the probe
set to the known set, which guarantees that any target movie in the probe set has been
collected by at least one user in the known set. The values of hri are slightly di erent
for these three implementations, however, the choice of di erent implementations has
no substantial e ect on our conclusions.
