Abstract Devising an index to measure the quality of research
is a challenging task. In this paper, we propose a set of indices
to evaluate the quality of research produced by an author. Our
indices utilize a policy that assigns the weights to multiple authors
of a paper. We have considered two weight assignment policies:
positionally weighted and equally weighted. We propose two classes
of weighted indices: weighted h-indices and weighted citation
h-cuts. Further, we compare our weighted h-indices with the
original h-index for a selected set of authors. As opposed to
h-index, our weighted h-indices take into account the weighted
contributions of individual authors in multi-authored papers, and
may serve as an improvement over h-index. The other class
of weighted indices that we call weighted citation h-cuts take
into account the number of citations that are in excess of those
required to compute the index, and may serve as a supplement
to h-index or its variants.
Index Terms Weights, articles, authors, citations, quality,
research.
I. INTRODUCTION
In many situations,
it becomes necessary to assess the
quality of research published by an author e.g. at the time
of recruitment, and at the time of allocation of grants to carry
out further research. To assess the quality of research produced
by a researcher, one needs an index which should be able
to quantify the quality of papers published by the author.
However, the design of an index for an assessment of the
quality of research produced by an author is a challenging
task. The challenge comes from the fact that an index should
be appropriate in the sense that it should be able to incorporate
several other things beyond merely an authorship such as
individual contributions in a collaborative work product.
To assess the quality of a paper and/or research produced
by an author, a number of measures are proposed in the
literature. For example, one such measure is, how many times
the published paper is cited by other papers. This measure
is called as the citations count for the particular paper. A
researcher might have published a number of papers, therefore,
the citation count for the researcher is the summation of the
citation counts of his/her papers. The measure citation count is
easy to compute. Speci cally, one can compute citation count
of an author using indexing databases such as Scopus, Web of
Science, Google Scholar, etc. However, citation count may not
be a good measure to assess the quality of research produced
by a researcher as it does not take into account the number of
authors and their individual contribution in the paper.
Another measure of the quality of research is h-index [1].
Axiomatic characterizations of h-index is carried out in [2],
[3], [5]. The predictive power of h-index is discussed in [8],
and its monotonicity is discussed in [4]. There are different
views of peer researchers about the h-index  many of them
consider h-index to be a good measure of the quality of re-
search produced by an author [13], [14], [15], yet some authors
are of the view that although h-index provides a ranking of
authors, however, citations considered for determining the h-
index need the context in which they are cited [6]. Some of the
variations of h-index are also proposed in the literature such as
rational or successive h-index [9], generalized h-index [10],
age decaying h-index [11], and enhanced h-index [12]. An
improvement over h-index called g-index is proposed in [16],
[17].
The measure h-index is also based on the number of
citation received by individual papers of an author, however,
as opposed to the citation counts which sums out the number
of citations of all n cited papers of an author, h-index does
not consider all cited papers of an author, it considers the
papers with some minimum number of citations. Speci cally,
it considers top h papers with at least h citations for each
individual paper, and the rest of the n h papers have less than
or equal to h citations. Like the citation count, the measure h-
index is also easy to compute. However, similar to the citation
count, it also does not take into account the number of authors
of a paper and their individual contributions in the paper. It
may happen that the top h-papers of a researcher that have
at least h citations may contain multiple authors in most
of his/her papers. On the other hand, there can be another
researcher who is the sole author of h papers each of which is
having at least h citations. Although, both the researchers have
the same h-index, however, there is a signi cant difference
between the individual contributions of the two authors, and
the h-index falls short of re ecting this difference.
It has been discussed in [27] that there should be well
de ned credits for co-authorship in the  eld of computer
science, and many suggestion are made pertaining to the future
of publishing in computer science and measures to address
ethical issues. Approximately, two and half decades before the
proposal of h-index, it was suggested in [24] that co-authors
of a paper can be allocated harmonic weights to determine
their relative contributions. It has been discussed in [23], [25],
and [26] that harmonic weights can enable one to equitably
share the authorship in multi-authored papers. To incorporate
the effect of multiple authors in h-index, several modi cations
are proposed in the literature including modi ed h-index (hm-
index) [19], adaptive pure h-index (ha) [21], fractional h-index
(hf -index) [22],  h-index [28]. We shall discuss in the later
part of this paper that there is a need of some other index
to supplement the h-index including its variants to clearly
distinguish among the qualities of publications produced by
different authors.
In this paper, we wish to answer the following research
question: What is the impact of the number of authors and
the position of a given author in the paper on the quality of
research produced by the author? Is h-index in its original
form suf cient to provide the quality of research or should it
be modi ed to re ect the contributions of a given author in
multi-authored papers? In this paper, we propose an index for
quantifying the quality of research produced by an author. Our
index takes into account the number of authors of the paper
and tries to incorporate their individual contributions to the
paper using the order of its authors. We discuss schemes for
assigning weights to authors and analyze the impact of author
positions on the proposed index. We compare the proposed
index with the existing h-index and discuss their relative merits
and demerits.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section
II, we present
the proposed weighted indices. Section III
contains an analysis of the positional weights used in the
proposed weighted indices. In Section IV, we present results
and discussion. Section V contains a comparison of our
work with the related works. Finally, the last section is for
conclusion and future directions.
II. PROPOSED INDICES
In this section, we wish to propose indices to evaluate the
quality of research produced by a given author. The papers can
either be written by a single author or multiple authors. As far
as, a paper with a single author is concerned, all citations fall in
the account of the sole author of the paper. However, the paper
that has multiple authors, the number of citations received do
not belong to only one author, but should be shared by all
authors of the paper. Speci cally, citations related to a multi-
authored paper should be divided among all authors of the
paper, preferably, according to their contributions. However,
there is no mechanism that can exactly tell the individual
contributions of the authors in a multi-authored paper. In the
absence of such an exact mechanism, we assume that the
position of an author in the list of the authors of the paper
gives an indication about the contribution of the author to the
paper, unless stated explicitly1. The assumption seems to be
realistic. Generally, the author whose name appears as the  rst
author has the maximum contribution, and the contribution of
1Generally, it is a hidden assumption that the order of authors is the order
of their individual contribution in decreasing order, unless stated otherwise.
Sometimes, authors provide a footnote that the names of authors in the list
are in alphabetical order. In that case, the order of authors in the list does not
imply the order of their contributions, and it becomes dif cult to determine
their order of contributions. However, in such an exceptional case, one may
assign equal weights to all authors of the paper.
the second author is less than that of the  rst author, and so
on. Therefore, one can assume that the position of an author
in the list of authors of the paper provides an indication about
the contributions of the author to the paper.
We now discuss the notion of weighted citations, which
shall be used to de ne the weighted indices. Let ci be number
of citations of ith paper of an author, the weighted citations
of the ith paper of the author are as follows.
  = ciwi
(1)
where wi is the weight assigned to the given author for his/her
ith paper under a weight assignment scheme, say A. In the
next section, we describe two weight assignment schemes,
namely, equal weight assignment scheme and positional weight
assignment scheme. Using the notion of weighted citations, we
de ne an index that we call weighted citation aggregate, as
follows.
De nition 1 (Weighted Citation Aggregate): Let there be n
the weighted
publications of a researcher (or an author),
citation aggregate,  , of the given author is as follows.
  =
n
Xi=1
ciwi
(2)
where, ci is the number of citations of the ith paper of the
author, and wi is the weight of the author in his/her ith paper
under a weight assignment scheme A.
As mentioned above,
there are two weight assignment
schemes  positional, and equal. Accordingly, there are two
weighted citation aggregates  positionally weighted citation
aggregate, and equally weighted citation aggregate. Let  p
be positionally weighted citation aggregate under a positional
weight assignment scheme, say P, and  e be equally weighted
citation aggregate under equal weight assignment scheme, say
E. We have,
and,
 p =
 e =
n
Xi=1
n
Xi=1
ciwi,  i wi   P
ciwi,  i wi   E.
(3)
(4)
Note that our notion of the weighted citations can be used
to modify the de nition of h-index [1] so that it is able to
incorporate the number of authors and/or position of the given
author in the list of authors of the paper. Note that h-index is
de ned as the number such that h papers out of n cited papers
of an author have received at least h citations and n h papers
have less than or equal to h citations. In the following, we use
the notion of weighted citations to propose an improvement
over h-index.
De nition 2 (Weighted h-index): Let ci be the citations of
ith paper of a given author, and let wi be the weight assigned
to the author using a weight assignment policy, say A. Let n
be the total number of papers published by the author and that
are cited by other papers. The weighted h-index is the number
such that weighted citations of the given author for his/her h
papers is at least h, and the remaining n   h papers have at
most h citations. In other words,
hw|wi A = hw, if (cid:18) hw
min
i=1
{ciwi}   hw, max
j6=i
{cjwj }   hw(cid:19) .
(5)
Again, as mentioned earlier, there are two schemes for assign-
ing the weights. As a result, there are two types of weighted
h indices: positionally weighted h-index, hp, drawing their
weights using policy, P; and equally weighted h-index, he,
drawing their weights using policy E. In other words,
hp|wi P = hp, if (cid:18) hp
min
i=1
{ciwi}   hp, max
j6=i
{cjwj }   hp(cid:19) (6)
and,
hp|wi A = hp, if(cid:18) hp
min
i=1
{ciwi}   hp, max
j6=i
{cjwj }   hp(cid:19) .
(7)
Note that weighted citation aggregates de ned above take into
account all cited papers of an author. In what follows, we
de ne an index that takes into account the weighted citations
of papers that form the weighted h-core of the given author.
We call this index weighted citation h-cut, whose de nition is
as follows.
De nition 3 (Weighted Citation H-Cut): Let hw be the
weighted h-index of an author, and let Hw be the set of
weighted citations of papers of a given author that contribute
to the weighted h-index of the author. The weighted citation
h-cut of the author,  w, is as follows.
 w =
|Hw|
Xi=1
ciwi
(8)
where, |Hw| denotes the cardinality of the set Hw.
We would like to mention again that there are two policies for
assigning the weights, namely, positional (P) and equal (E).
Accordingly, there are two weighted citation h-cut, which are
as follows.
|Hp|
 p =
 e =
Xi=1
|He|
Xi=1
ciwi|wi P
ciwi|wi E
(9)
(10)
where, |Hp| and |He| are the cardinalities of the sets forming
h-cores under policies P and E, respectively.
In what follows, we describe how to assign the positional
weights.
III. ASSIGNMENT OF POSITIONAL WEIGHTS
The weight, wi of the author in the ith paper is related to
his/her position in the list of authors of ith paper. We call it
positional weight or the contribution of the author in his/her ith
paper. The positional weights satisfy the following properties.
  For papers with multiple authors, the positional weights
have to be designed in such a manner so that the  rst
author is given more weight than the second author, the
second author is given more weight than the third author,
and so on. In other words, wi > wj,  i < j.
  The summation of these weights for all authors of the
paper is equal to one. In other words, let there be k
authors a paper, and author j, 1   j   k, be assigned a
weight wj, then the following holds.
k
Xj=1
wj = 1.
(11)
There is a question: How can one assign these weights so
that wi > wj,  i < j? In what follows, we present an intuitive
scheme for assigning weights to authors of the same paper.
Lemma 1: Let there be k authors of a paper, and w = {wj}
be the weights assigned to the jth author of the paper where
j varies from 1 to k. A possible scheme for assigning weights
to jth author of the paper can be
wj =
2(k   j + 1)
k(k + 1)
(12)
j=1 wj = 1.
where, 0   wj   1, and Pk
Proof: Given that there are k authors of the paper. Let j be
an integer, varying from 1 to k, that represents the position of
an author in list of the authors of the paper. Then, summation
of the positions of all authors of the paper is given by
Sp =
k
Xj=1
j
=
k(k + 1)
2
.
(13)
Let the contribution of an author whose name appears at the
jth position in the list of authors of the paper be  j such that
j=1  j = 1, and  i >  j,  i < j. Intuitively,
the position of authors and their contributions can be listed
as follows.
0    j   1, Pk
j :
 j :

Sp
2
k 1
Sp
3
k 2
Sp
..
..
j
k j+1
Sp
..
..
k

Sp
.
This is in contrast to the shares of persons whose ratios of
shares are speci ed. The contrast lies in the fact that in case
of shares the contribution of a person is more if his/her ratio
is larger irrespective of his/her position in the ratios, however,
the contribution of an author is assumed to be decreasing with
the position of author in the list of authors of the paper.
The contribution of an author appearing at the jth position
is given by
 j =
=
=
k   j + 1
Sp
k   j + 1
k(k+1)
2
2(k   j + 1)
k(k + 1)
.
(14)
which is same as given by (12) except the name of the variable
which is wj instead of  j.
Formally, we prove (12) using the principle of mathematical
induction as follows.

Figure 1 shows positional weights of authors as a function
of the number of authors of a paper. Note that the successive
points lying from top to bottom along the vertical grid lines
show the weights starting from author position one onwards.
For example, if there are 7 authors, then the vertical grid
line corresponding to the number of authors to be equal to 7
contains the weights of  rst, second, ..., seventh author from
the top to bottom. The same is true for the remaining numbers
of authors.
Based on the Lemma 1, we have the following corollary.
Corollary 1: Let there be k authors of a paper. The differ-
ence in the weights assigned to the  rst author and the last
author is a positive quantity for k > 1 and is given by

  For k = 1, j can have only one value and that is equal
to 1, therefore, w1 = 1, which is true. As a result, (12)
holds for k = 1.
  Assume that (12) is satis ed for an integer k, where k
is the number of authors of the paper. Adding one more
author to the list of authors of the paper, the number of
authors becomes k + 1. For k + 1 authors, we can rewrite
j and  j as follows.

The value of Sp is given by

= (k + 1)(cid:18) k
2
+ 1(cid:19)
=
(k + 1){(k + 1) + 1}
2
.
The value of  j is given by
 j =
k + 1   j + 1
(k+1){(k+1)+1}
2
=
2{(k + 1)   j + 1}
(k + 1){(k + 1) + 1}
.
which is true (or satis ed for k = k + 1). Therefore,
by principle of mathematical induction (12) holds for all
integers.
Table I shows the number of authors and their weights
according to their relative position in the list of authors
of a paper. Note that the weights decrease with increasing
the position number. Also, the weight of the same position
decreases with the increase in the number of authors. By
using unequal position based weights the weight of the author
whose name  gures out later in the list of authors of the paper
is assigned less weight than the author whose name appears
earlier.
wp

k =

k (cid:18) k   1
k + 1(cid:19) .
Proof: Using (12), the weight of the  rst author is
wp

2
k + 1
.
The weight of the kth author is
wp
k =
2
k(k + 1)
.
(15)

Therefore, the difference of the weights of the  rst and the

k + 1(cid:19)
which is a positive quantity for k > 1, and 0 for k = 12.
Note that if all authors were assigned an equal weight, then
the weight of each author would have been 1
k . We now have the
following lemma that gives the difference between the weights
assigned under equal weights scheme and the weights assigned
under position based scheme.
Lemma 2: Let k be the number of authors of a paper. Let
j be the weight assigned to the jth author of the paper
we
in equal weight scheme, and wp
j be the weight assigned
to jth author in positional weight scheme. The amount of
increase/decrease in the weight of the jth author in positional
weight scheme as compared to equal weight scheme is given
by the following expression.
wp

Proof: Using (12) weight assigned to jth author in the
positional weight scheme is

j =
2(k   j + 1)
k(k + 1)
.
(19)
2Note that k = 1 means that there is only one author, who is the  rst
author as well as the last author. As a result, there is no difference between
the weights of the  rst author and the last author.

The weight assigned to jth author under equal weight scheme

In the following, we provide another lemma that gives the
difference between the weights of authors in the equal weight
scheme and the positional weight scheme.

Lemma 3: Let wp
k be the weights of the  rst and
the last authors, respectively, in the position based weight
assignment scheme, and let we be the weight assigned to
each author in equal weight assignment scheme. The following
expression holds.
wp
1   we =  (we   wp
k) =
1
k (cid:18) k   1
k + 1(cid:19) ,  k > 1.

Proof: Note that the weight assigned to each author in
equal weight assignment scheme is given by
we =

(22)
Reversing the sign of the above expression, we have
wp
k   we =  
1
k (cid:18) k   1
k + 1(cid:19) .
In other words, weights assigned to each author in equal
weight assignment scheme are lying on half way of the weights
assigned to the  rst and the last authors in position based
weight assignment scheme. This also indicates that the amount
of increase in the positional weights of some of the authors is
equal to the amount of decrease in the positional weights of
the remaining authors.

authors of a paper under positional weight scheme and under
equal weight scheme. In case of positional weight scheme,
we observe that when a person is the sole author of the paper,
he/she is assigned a weight of 1. When the number of authors
is two, the  rst author is assigned a weight of 2
3   0.666, and
the second author is assigned a weight of 1
3   0.333. Note that
if the two authors would have been assigned an equal weight,
the weight of each of the author would have been 1
2 = 0.5. As
compared to equal weight scheme, the increase in the weight
of the  rst author under positional weight scheme is 16.6%;
the same is the decrease in the weight of the second author. As
mentioned earlier, if there are k authors in a paper, the weight
assigned to each authors is 1
k under equal weight scheme and
weights assigned according to the position of authors is given
by (12). The weight assigned under equal weight scheme fall
in between the weights assigned to the  rst author and the last
author of the paper.
Figure 3 shows the relative increase or decrease in the
weights of the  rst author and the last author of a paper
using positional weight scheme as compared to the weights
assigned using equal weight scheme. The minus sign shows
that it is a decrease in the weight under positional weight
scheme as compared to weights under equal weight scheme.
We observe that the weight of the  rst author of a paper is
always increased under positional weight scheme with respect
to equal weight scheme, and the weights of the second or later
authors are always decreased under positional weight scheme
as compared to equal weight scheme. Also, note that under
positional weight scheme the increase in the weight of the
 rst author is exactly the same as the decrease in the weight
of the last author.
Note that under position based weight assignment scheme,
the difference between the weights of the  rst and the last
authors decreases with the number of authors (see Figure 2).
Similarly, in Figure 3, the increase in the weight of the  rst
author with respect to weight assigned to each author in equal
weight assignment scheme reduces as a function of the number
of authors, and the decrease in the weight of the last author
under positional weight assignment scheme also reduces as
compared to the weight assigned to each author using equal
weight assignment scheme. This is in accordance with the
limits given by the following lemma.

Increase in the positional weights of authors as a function of the
scheme decrease as a function of the number of authors of a
paper (Figure 2). The same applies to the difference between
the weight assigned to each author in equal weight assignment
scheme and that of the weights of either of the  rst author or
of the last author in positional weight scheme (Figure 3).
The expression in Lemma 3 says that the amount of increase
in the positional weights of some authors of the paper is
equal to the amount of decrease in the positional weights of
the remaining authors. This is exempli ed in Figure 4, which
shows an increase in the positional weights (i.e. wp
j   we) of
authors as a function of the number of authors of the paper.
Note that in Figure 4, the point lying along the vertical grid
lines show an increase if the point lies above the zero x-axis
horizontal line, and it shows a decrease if the point lies below
the zero x-axis horizontal line. We observe that when there is
only one author of a paper, the positional and equally assigned
weight are the same. This results in 0 increase in the positional
weight as compared to the equally assigned weight of the  rst
author in a single authored paper. When the number of authors
is 2, the increase in the positional weight of the  rst author is
0.1666, the same is the decrease in the positional weight of
the second author. In general, if there are k authors in a paper,
the amount of increase in the positional weight of 1st author
will be equal to the amount of decrease in the kth author of
the paper. Consider, for example, the number of authors of the
paper to be equal to 5. The amount of increase in the positional
weight of 1st author is equal to the amount of decrease in the
5th author, and the amount of increase in the positional weight
of 2nd author is equal to the amount of decrease in the 4th
author; the amount of increase/decrease in the 3rd author is 0.
The same is true for the remaining numbers of authors.

A. Comparison of Weighted Indices with H-Index
In this section, we compare the proposed weighted indices
with an existing index known as h-index [1]. As mentioned
earlier, h-index is simple to compute, however, its demerits
are as follows.
  Multiplicity of Authors: It does not take into account
multiplicity of authors of papers that belongs to the set
of papers for h-index. Also, it does not take into account
the contribution of authors to their individual papers. In
other words, there can be two authors with the same h-
index, however, most of the papers of one author may
have multiple authors and the other author can be rather
independent i.e. in most of his/her papers, he/she is either
the sole author or the number of authors is much less than
the former one. Depending upon the number of authors
in each paper that belong to h-core,
their individual
contributions in each paper may not be the same.
  Author Position: It does not consider the order of the
authors in the list of authors of each paper belonging to
h-core. In other words, among the two authors with the
same h-index, it may happen that one is the  rst author
in most of his/her papers, and the other is the second
or later author in most of his/her papers. Although, the
contributions of the two authors to their individual papers
are different, h-index does not re ect this difference.
  Citation Spikes: It does not take into account the spikes in
citations of the papers belonging to the h-core. Suppose,
the two authors have the same h-index, however, out of
the papers forming h-core, some papers of one author
have a large number of citations, and other papers have
the number of citations just greater than or equal to h.
On the other hand, the number of citations of the papers
of the other author are just greater than or equal to h.
Although, there is a signi cant difference between the
quality of research produced by the two authors, however,
h-index does not re ect this difference.
To understand it better consider the following example.
Example 1: The citations, number of authors, and author
position of authors A and B are given in Table II3. Let us
compute their h-indices and the proposed weighted indices.
Solution: We compute the h-indices and one of the proposed
indices as follows.
  For computing the h-indices, note that 10 papers of both
authors have at least 10 citations and the remaining (12 
10) = 2 papers have less than 10 citations, therefore, h-
indices of both the authors are 10.
  Let us now compute their weighted indices (speci cally,
we compute one of the weighted indices called the
positionally weighted citation h-cut as de ned in (9) of
both the authors. The positionally weighted citation h-cut
We  rst compare the proposed positional indices with the
h-index through an example and then present results for a set
of authors.
3We consider this example with relatively a smaller h-index due to space
limitations and just to illustrate the ideas. One can create an example with
relatively a larger h-index.

Note that there is a large difference between the quality
of research produced by author A and author B. In general,
the proposed weighted indices, speci cally with positional
weights, take into account not only the number of authors
of each paper belonging to the h-core, they also take into
account the position of the given author in the list of authors
of each paper. As a result, the proposed weighted indices are
able to differentiate among the two researchers based on the
number of authors and their positional contributions to each of
their papers belonging to their individual h-cores. Further, as
opposed to h-index, the weighted indices take into account the
spikes in the number of citations. In other words, they are able
to differentiate among the two authors based on the weighted
citations of each paper belonging to their respective h-cores.
B. Performance of Indices
We computed proposed indices for a set of authors with the
following values of h-index: {84, 73, 67, 62, 58}. We used a
freely available indexing database, called Microsoft Academic
Search [18], for citations corresponding to authors with the
given h-indices, speci cally, of networks and communications
group. For computing the positional indices, we followed the
following procedure. Let ci, i = 1 to n, be the citations

of ith paper of the given author with k number of authors
and let j, 1   p   k, be the position of the author in the
list of authors of the paper. We computed weighted citations
= ciwi for each paper of the author. The assignment of
ci
weights, wi, is discussed in the previous section. We then
computed the indices for both position based weights as well
as equal weights. We computed the positional h-index, hp
from the weighted citations c
i. There are two weighted h-
indices: hp and he depending upon which weighted citations
we consider in computing them i.e. positionally weighted or
equally weighted.
 
Table III shows the values of h-index, positionally weighted
h-index, hp, equally weighted h-index, he, positionally
weighted citation cut,  p, and equally weighted citation cut,
 e. Authors are listed in decreasing order of their original h-
index. This forms one ranking of authors considered herein,
namely {A, B, C, D, E}, in that order, which is based on the
original h-index. However, a closer look reveals that even
though the original h-index of author E (with rank 5) is the
least, however, his/her positionally weighted h-index hp = 33
is better than the authors D whose positionally weighted h-
index is hp = 28. Based on positionally weighted h-index, the
rank of author E is ahead of author D i.e. the new ranking
is {A, B, C, E, D}, in that order. This fact is visible from
Figure 5, which shows h-index, positionally weighted h-index,
and equally weighted h-index for authors numbered 1 (or A)
through 5 (or E). On the basis of equally weighted h-index,
he, authors D and E. However, equally weighted h-index, hp,
of author D and E is the same and is equal to 33. Therefore,
on the basis of equally weighted index, he, the ranking of
authors is {A, B, E, {C, D}}.
On the other hand, on the basis of weighted citation h-cuts,
 w and  e, author E is better than authors D and C, which
have ranks 4 and 3, respectively. This fact is clearly visible
from Figure 6, which shows a comparison of weighted citation
h-cuts of authors 1 (or A) through 5 (or E). As a result, based
on the weighted citation h-cuts, which consider the number of
authors and the position of authors, the ranking of the given
set of authors needs to be modi ed. The new ranking, then,
is {A, B, E, C, D}, in that order.
Figure 7 shows the number of citations received by the top
h papers of the given set of authors (i.e. from author numbered
A to author numbered E) in descending order of the number of
citations received by individual papers. Note that the number
of citations of each author decrease with the paper number
because the papers are arranged in descending order of their
citation counts. Also, we observe that the number of citations
of some authors, such as author A and author E, are very

large for the  rst few papers as compared to the papers that
appear later in the list of cited papers. Speci cally, the number
of citations of author E for the  rst few papers are larger than
that of author A, however, the later papers of author E are
cited less as compared to author A. As mentioned earlier, h-
index of author A is larger than that of author E (see Table III),
therefore, in the ranking which is based on h-index, author A
precedes author B. However, the citations of  rst few papers
of author E are larger than those of author C and author D,
and for later papers citations of author E are comparable to
those of authors C and D, therefore, the weighted citations of
author E are larger than those of author C and author D. The
reason is that the  rst few papers of author E enhance the
number of papers with larger number of weighted citations
as compared to author C and author D. Consequently, the
weighted h-index of author C is larger than those of author
C and author D (see Table III).
Figure 8 shows positionally weighted citations of the top
h papers of a given set of authors. Note that in case of
positionally weighted citations, the citations of a paper are
divided among the authors of the paper according to their
Fig. 7. Citations of the top h papers of a given set of authors.
Paper
positional weights, and the positional weight assigned to a
given author depends upon the number of authors and the
position of the given author in the list of authors of the paper.
Comparing this with Figure 7, we observe that the descending
order in the number of citations of individual papers as in
Figure 7 is not maintained in Figure 8. The reason is that the
number of authors and the position of the given author varies
from paper to paper. As the weights assigned depend on the
number of authors and the position of author, therefore, the
weights vary from paper to paper. As a result, the positionally
weighted citations vary from paper to paper. Therefore, the
original order among the citations of the papers may not be
preserved.
Figure 9 shows equally weighted citations of the top h
papers of a given set of authors. Again, we wish to emphasize
that
the descending order in the number of citations of
individual papers may not be maintained in case of equally
weighted citations. Although, in equally weighted citations, the
citations of a paper are divided equally among the authors of
the paper. However, the number of authors of each paper that
are arranged in descending order of the number of citations
are different. Therefore, the number of citations after dividing
them with the corresponding number of authors may not
be in the descending order. This accounts for the observed
behaviour.
V. COMPARISON WITH THE RELATED WORKS
A modi cation of h-index, called hm index, that takes into
account multiple co-authors, is proposed in [19], [20]. Another
variant of h-index that takes into account multiple authors,
called an adapted pure h-index, is proposed in [21]. Let us
denote the adaptive pure h-index by the symbol ha where the
subscript a is for the quali er  adaptive . In adaptive pure h-
index, the number of citations of a paper are divided by the
square-root of the number of authors of the paper.
A mathematical theory of the h-index and g-index in case of
fractional counting of authorship is described in [22]. Therein,
citation counts of ith paper of an author are divided by the
number of authors of paper i, and then variants of h-index

Paper
Equally weighted citations of the top h papers of a given set of
and g-index, called fractional h-index, hf , and fractional g-
index, gf , respectively, are computed. Another variant of the
fractional h-index called hF index (and correspondingly the
variant of gindex called gF index, however, in this paper
we are interested only in h-index and not the g-index) is
obtained such that the summation of the inverse of the number
of authors is greater than or equal to the the summation of
the top citation counts (provided that the citation counts are
arranged in the descending order). The idea behind computing
the fractional h-index, speci cally computing hF , is novel and
applies well when one considers the publications of an author.
However, it logically seems to isolate or decouple the number
of citations from the number of authors of the individual
papers while comparing a number of authors. For example,
consider that there are two authors A and B, jth papers of A
and B have received a and b number of citations, respectively,
and have the same number of authors, say m. Irrespective of
the actual values of a and b, there is an increment of 1
m in the
fractional h-index, hF . This is justi ed when the values of a
and b are comparable, however, if there is a large difference
between the values of a and b, then not taking into account
their actual values in the computation of the index does not
seem to be justi ed. For example, if a = 10, b = 100, and
m = 3 will incur an increment of 0.333 in hF for both the
authors, irrespective of how large the difference is between
the number of citations of both the authors for jth paper.
Comparing our weighted indices to the fractional index, hF ,
proposed in [22] reveals that the weighted indices take into
account the weighted citations of individual papers of each
author.
To account for the multiple authors of papers, a harmonic
allocation of authorship credits is described in [23] in the
context of what kind of biases one may have for authors
of the paper. The harmonic allocation of authorship credits
was suggested in [24] and recently in [25]. It is discussed in
[26] that harmonic weights enable authors to share authorship
credits equitably rather than equally. Therein, it has been dis-
cussed that harmonic authorship credit scores can be applied
to authors in different  elds such as psychology, medicine,
chemistry. Further, four types of authorship credits harmonic,
arithmetic, geometric, fractional  are discussed in [26].
Our concept of positional weights is similar to the harmonic
allocation of authorship credits proposed in [23]. However,
in this paper, we have carried out a rigorous mathematical
analysis of the positional weights and we have derived the
expressions related to the positional weights. Further, we
have discussed that the h-index with positional weights, hp,
would be more relevant as compared to the original h-index,
because hp takes into account multiple authors and their
relative contributions in the papers belonging to the h-core.
We have pointed out that when one arranges the number
of citations of papers in the descending order, the h-core
when the citations are not weighted may not be the same
as the h-core when the citations are weighted. Note that the
weighted h indices, be it positionally weighted or equally
weighted, do take into account multiple authors in the papers,
however, they do not re ect the spikes in the number of
weighted citations. To take into account the spikes in the
number of weighted citations of an author, we de ned another
class of indices called weighted citation h-cuts. To explain
how to compute weighted h-indices and weighted citation h-
cuts, we considered a  ctitious example and an example from
the real world a group of authors belonging to the network
and communication from a freely available indexing database
Microsoft Academic Search. Further, we would like to mention
that our concepts of weighted h-indices and weighted citation
h-cuts are not limited to only positional weights, rather, they
are open to any kinds of weights that seem to be appropriately
share authorship credits. This is because we have taken into
account the policy according to which the weights are assigned
in the de nitions of indices. A change of the policy for
assigning the weights shall incur a corresponding change in
the weights for the authorship, and the indices shall change
accordingly.
On the other hand, an index to quantify the scienti c
research output of an individual author that takes into account
the effect of multiple co-authorship proposed in [28]. The
index is called  h-index (pronounced as hbar-index), and is
de ned as the number of papers of an individual author having

feautures of the h-index and its variants together with the
indices proposed in this paper. Note that in Table IV, we
consider only those indices which take into account multiple
authorship except the original h-index.
However, h-index and its variants such as hm [19], ha [21],
hf [22],  h [28], including the weighted h-index proposed in
this paper do not take into account the portions of citations
that are greater than or in excess of the corresponding h-index
or its variants. It is to note that there is something signi cant
to be revealed, about the quality of research produced by an
author, by the portion of citations that is in excess to those
needed to compute the h-index or its variants and should
not simply be ignored. Therefore, there is a need to have
a supplement to the h-index or its variant even for multi-
authored papers. One of the supplement can be the g-index
proposed in [16]. The g-index considers the missing upper and
lower portions of citations of authors. However, while having
an h-index, one would not like to have the missing lower
citations of an individual because that is not going to enhance
the quality of publications. In fact, it is the upper portion or the
excess in number of citations belonging to the corresponding
h-core of the index that may affect (or enhance) the quality of
publications of an individual. We would like to mention that
the weighted citation h-cuts may serve as a supplement to the
h-index or its variants as it does take into account the number
of citations that are in excess of that required to compute the
index.
VI. CONCLUSION
The design of an index to quantify the quality of research is
a challenging task. In this paper, we proposed a set of indices
for determining the quality of research, namely, weighted
citation aggregate, weighted h-index, and weighted citation h-
cuts. Our indices try to take into account the contributions
made by an author in a multi-authored paper. As there is
no mechanism to exactly determine the contribution of an
individual author in a multi-authored paper, therefore, we
assumed that the position of an author in the list of authors
of the paper may provide an indication about their individual
contributions, unless speci ed explicitly. In other words, the
contribution of an author is assumed to be in accordance
with the order in which the names of authors appear in the
list of authors of the paper. Authors whose names appear
earlier in the list are assumed to have a larger contribution
as compared to the authors whose names appear later in the
list. We have used two weight assignment policies: positionally
weighted and equally weighted. We have analyzed these weight
assignment policies and compared their effects on the weighted
indices. We would like to mention that the de nitions of our
weighted indices are open to any weight assignment policy
or scheme that seems to address multiple authorship in an
appropriate manner. We compared our indices with the h-
index for a selected set of authors. As opposed to h-index,
a class of index that we called the weighted h-indices take
into account the weighted contributions of authors in multi-
authored papers. Further, the other class of weighted indices
that we called weighted citation h-cuts, take into account the
number of citations that are in excess to determining an index,
and may serve as a supplement to h-index or its variants. In
future, one may study the effect of citation contexts on the
quality of research produced by an author.
