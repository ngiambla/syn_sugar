We consider random walks that start and are absorbed on the leaves of random networks and
study the length of such walks. For the networks we investigate, Erd os-R enyi random graphs and
Barab asi-Albert scale free networks, these walks are not transient and we consider various approaches
to computing the probability of a given length walk. One approach is to label nodes according to
both their total degree and the number of links connected to leaf nodes, and as a byproduct we
compute the probability of a random node of a scale free network having such a label.

INTRODUCTION
Random walks have played a signi cant role in physics over the last century and more recently their properties on
random networks have received attention as they can model transport properties of complex systems. In this work we
consider random walks that start on leaf nodes of the random network and are absorbed whenever they reach another
leaf node. For certain types of network transport this is a natural restriction. For example, while di usion has been
proposed to model communication tra c on the internet [1 3], the majority of such tra c is between hosts lying at
the edge of the network and would be better modelled by the type of random walk we consider in this paper.
Past studies of non-absorbing random walks on random networks [4 8] have often concentrated on the mean  rst
passage or hitting times [9]. Typically, the mean  rst passage time scales with the size of the network and the walk
is transient in the thermodynamic limit. In contrast, at least for the networks we have studied, we  nd that the
probabilities of given path lengths between leaves are independent of the size of the network. Moreover, the walks
we study are often short and techniques that rely on di usion reaching equilibrium are not obviously adaptable since
the largest eigenvalue does not have time to become dominant. Besides averaging over networks of a given class, we
average over many walks in order to  nd representative results for a given type of random network. For a long running
non-absorbing random walk, the equilibrium node occupation probability is proportional to the degree of that node
[4]. Even after averaging over walks, this is not the the case for walks between leaves as links from leaf nodes must
be treated di erently. One way to do this is to consider an approach based on labelling nodes according to both
their total degree k and the number of links l connecting to leaf nodes. We propose a technique in which the average
occupation probabilities are proportional to the number of non-leaf links besides adapting other methods that appear
in the literature.
The networks we have chosen to study are the traditional Erd os and R enyi (ER) [10] random graphs and the scale
free models due to Barab asi and Albert (BA)[11]. There is consensus that the scale free networks model real networks
better than ER random graphs. On the other hand, random graphs are more analytically tractable, principally due
to their lack of correlation between node degrees at each end of a link. Since it is essential that our networks have
leaf nodes, we work in the sparse regime of the ER graphs and choose the simplest BA graph.
Our main interest lies in the probability, pt, for a walk of length t between leaves. For short walks that can be
enumerated, this probability can sometimes be computed exactly and displays di erences between even and odd length
walks due to the possibility of being absorbed by the originating leaf node. We expend some e ort on these short
walks, but are also interested in longer walks. For ER networks, the probability of longer walks decays exponentially
but the correlations and lack of homogeneity of BA networks destroys this simple behaviour. Despite the hierarchical
structure of the internet, data for the fraction of packets arriving at an edge node after a certain number of hops
displays an exponential decay over a range up to about 30 hops. The most successful techniques to estimate the rate
of decay of the probability for long walks are based on a modi ed assumption of the equilibrium occupation of nodes
labelled by (k, l), the degree and the number of links to leaf nodes.
We commence with some simple and instructive network models to develop intuition for the process. The next
section covers Erd os and R enyi random graphs and we provide both analytic and simulation results. We then move
on to discuss the problem on a scale free network: the m = 1 BA model with leaves. The conclusion returns to discuss
the motivating example of the internet and summarises our results.
II. SIMPLE NETWORKS
2
To commence, recall the random walk [12] on the half line in which the walker starts by taking a step to the right
from the origin, and is absorbed if it returns there. At each subsequent (discrete) time step the probability of moving
one step to the right is p and that for a step to the left is 1   p. The recursion relation for the occupancy probability
can be solved with the help of a Fourier transform, and a generating function approach yields an expression for the
 rst passage probabilities [9]. Paths that return to the origin always take an even number of steps and these paths
typically involve many backtracks or reversals. Counting these paths amounts to a tree enumeration problem which is
implicitly solved by the generating function computation. The  rst passage probabilities, rt, can be expressed using
a Catalan number as.
The sum over probabilities for all length paths is related to the generating function for Catalan numbers. This involves
a square root and by taking the appropriate sign we  nd that the overall probability of return is given by.
r2n = pt 1(1   p)n (2n   2)!
n!(n   1)!

(cid:26) 1
p   1/2
p > 1/2
1 p

r2n =
n=1

(4)
So if the walk is biased to the right, the overall probability that it will ever return is less than 1 and this behaviour
is said to be transient. Of course, transience can only occur in the limit of an in nitely large network.
  =  (1/2) log 4p(1   p).
Asymptotically, for long paths, the probability of a path of a given length decays exponentially with the exponent
lim
t   rt =
 
1
4p
 
(4p(1   p))t/2 =
 
1
4p
 
e  t
(3)
The case p = 1/2 is special and gives rise to power law decay.
The case on a  nite line with two boundaries or leaves is treated in [13], but this does not give rise to any new
concepts.
Now consider a Cayley tree. The degree of vertices is taken to be constant k and rather than follow the precise
location of the random walk, we track the level within the tree. We assume a Cayley tree with a large number of
levels, but start from the boundary level which is the only level containing leaves. The probability that the walk
moves one level towards the root is p = 1/k while the probability it moves towards the boundary is 1  p. In terms of
levels, the rest of the analysis is identical to that of the 1D random walk just considered, though in this case the real
tree has many possible leaves and walks that start and end on di erent nodes are accounted for. For integer values
of k, this walk will never be transient. The exponent   =  (1/2) log(4/k(1   1/k) does not depend on the size of the
graph, provided it is large enough. Note that a non-absorbing random walk from the root of an in nite Cayley tree
is transient with return probability 1/(k   1) for k   3 [6].
The  nal simple network we consider is a modi cation of the random regular network to allow the presence of
leaves. This network is constructed by  rst taking an ordinary random regular network in which all nodes have the
same degree and links are connected along the lines of the con guration approach of Molloy and Reed[14]. Then, to
each node, an additional l links are attached each ending in a leaf. Each of the non-leaf nodes then has total degree k
with l links to leaves and k   l links to other non-leaf nodes. From the regularity of the problem it is straightforward
to see that the probability of a random walk starting and ending on a leaf and making t steps is.
(cid:18) k   l
(cid:19)t 2
pt =

k
Again the decay is exponential and the exponent   does not depend on the size of the graph. By summing these
probabilities we  nd that the walk is never transient and that it has mean length 1 + k/l.
This study of simple networks suggests that the probability of longer walks decays exponentially for homogeneous
networks and that the exponent is not dependent on the size of the network. Imagine that a walk has survived until
step t, then the probability,  , that it will survive one more step is just that of avoiding a leaf node.
  = e   = 1   P (transition to a leaf node)
(5)
The decay is exponential when the transition probability does not depend on the length of the walk, and this is the
case for homogeneous networks. We will estimate the transition probability for ER and BA networks in the following
sections.
III. ERD  OS-R ENYI RANDOM GRAPHS
3
It is more awkward to analyse random walks on networks in which the degree distribution is not  xed since the
walk learns information about the structure of the network instance as it proceeds and this memory should be taken
into account for backtracks. The most tractable models to consider are the Erd os and R enyi [10] (ER) random graphs
due to both the absence of correlations between node degrees and their locally tree-like structure. Indeed, since this
is the natural model, random walks on ER graphs have been studied extensively; but only relatively recently has
the hitting time, which scales with the size of the graph, been computed [6]. One of the di culties with traditional
random walks on ER graphs has been that the interesting issues of transience only occur if the walk takes place on
the giant component which is only present above the percolation threshold at (cid:104)k(cid:105) = 1. Early work [5] avoided this
di culty by working in the dense regime where with high probability, all nodes belong to the giant component. A
mean  eld like approach [7] allows accurate estimates of the mean  rst passage time, but is more suited to numerical
than analytic expression.
FIG. 1: An enumeration of the three paths that contribute to a length 4 random walk between leaf nodes. Open circles represent
leaf nodes and  lled circles are intermediate, non-leaf nodes. The contribution of each path is given in equation (8).
In studying ER graphs we use the following notation. The probability of a node picked at random having degree k
is Poisson distributed.
nk =
(cid:104)k(cid:105)k
k!
e (cid:104)k(cid:105)
(6)
The probability that the node at the end of randomly chosen link has degree k must include a factor for the number
of links leading to that node.
knk(cid:104)k(cid:105)
(7)
Short paths can be enumerated, for example there are three t = 4 length paths shown in  gure 1. By combining
the probability of reaching a node with given degree with the random walk factor for leaving it, these paths are seen
to contribute respectively.

The sums can be written in terms of exponential integrals and are used to check numerical simulations. This diagram-
matic approach is restricted to very short paths as no simple recursion exists and the number of diagrams increases
rapidly.
Numerical studies indicate that the walks between leaves that we consider in this paper have the same properties
as on the simple models: they do not scale with the size of the system and their probability decays as shown in  gure
2. For these leaf random walks there is no need to restrict the starting leaf nodes to be part of the giant component
and we include the contribution from walks on the  nite clusters. Below the percolation transition, where only  nite

clusters exist, the decay su ers strong  nite size e ects and is not exponential. Above the transition, the decay is
exponential and in  gure 3 we show the exponent as a function of the mean degree parameter (cid:104)k(cid:105) of the model. These
numerical results are obtained from following 10000 random walks on each of 100 graphs of size 8000. The number of
random walks followed must be large both at small and large (cid:104)k(cid:105). At small (cid:104)k(cid:105) there are many possible leaf nodes to
start from, though the walks tend to be short. At large (cid:104)k(cid:105) there are not so many leaf nodes, but the walks can take
many di erent paths. These results do not change as the network size is increased suggesting that transience does
not occur.
FIG. 3: The decay exponent for random walks between leaves on an ER graph shown for various values of the mean degree
parameter. The dotted line shows the rough estimate of the the exponent from equation (9). The continuous line is the result
of a more sophisticated argument given at the end of section III A.
The behaviour of the exponent at large (cid:104)k(cid:105) can be estimated following the argument in equation (5). For large (cid:104)k(cid:105)
we ignore memory e ects and estimate the probability that a walk will survive one more step as.

knk(cid:104)k(cid:105) = 1   n1(cid:104)k(cid:105) = 1   e (cid:104)k(cid:105)
(9)
The exponent is thus   =   log(1  e (cid:104)k(cid:105)) or approximately e (cid:104)k(cid:105) for large (cid:104)k(cid:105). This estimate is shown in as a dotted
line in  gure 3 and indeed matches the simulations for large (cid:104)k(cid:105). In a later section we improve this estimate.
We now proceed to discuss more sophisticated approximations, with the aim of improving the prediction of walk
survival probabilities in the region where the exact enumeration in not feasible, but the exponential behaviour has
either not taken over, or the estimate above is not accurate.
A. Labeling according to (k, l)
5
Since the identi cation of leaf nodes is crucial for the random walks we study in this paper, we  rst propose an
approach based on labelling each node according to both its overall degree k and the number of links to leaf nodes l.
For ER graphs it is straightforward to write the probability, qkl, that a node chosen at random has label (k, l).
The sum over leaf links of course obeys.
qkl =
1   e (cid:104)k(cid:105)(cid:17)k l
nk

lqkl = n1 = (cid:104)k(cid:105)e (cid:104)k(cid:105)
(10)
(11)
(12)
(15)
The expectation value for the number of links to leaves found on a randomly chosen node is:
In order to proceed, we  rst identify the probabilities with which a walk will  nd a (k, l) node. The probability, vkl,
that the link from a randomly chosen leaf node connects to a (k, l) node is:
k
l
vkl =
lqkl(cid:104)l(cid:105) =
lqkl
(cid:104)k(cid:105)e (cid:104)k(cid:105)
Similarly, the probability, wkl, that a randomly chosen link from a non-leaf node connects to a (k, l) node is:
wkl =
(k   l)qkl
(cid:104)k(cid:105)   (cid:104)l(cid:105) =
(k   l)qkl
(cid:104)k(cid:105)(1   e (cid:104)k(cid:105))
(13)
(14)
It is now possible to write down probabilities for given length paths using the simplest form of approximation in which
there is no memory and backtracks are not accounted for. The separate contributions at each step of the walk from
the transition probability to a given degree (k, l) node and from the random walk are clearly exposed.

Where the  nal line is valid for any t   3. The predictions for paths of length 1 and 2 match the exact enumeration
results and that for length 3 di ers from the exact result by a factor of (1  e (cid:104)k(cid:105)). However, the prediction contained
in the last equation above, for the exponent of the decay is less successful. In the limit of large (cid:104)k(cid:105) this prediction
di ers by a factor a 2 from equation (9) which suggested a value of e (cid:104)k(cid:105) and according to  gure 3 the earlier argument
was correct. Moreover the failure extends to transience as the sum of probabilities is 1/2 in the large (cid:104)k(cid:105) limit which
does not match numerical expectations. Given these inadequacies, we do not show a  gure with the predictions from
this approximation and conclude that while neglecting both memory e ects and backtracks is possible for very short
paths, it fails for longer paths even at large (cid:104)k(cid:105).
We can reproduce the simple prediction given in equation (9) for the asymptotic decay exponent using the (k, l)
formalism. Assuming that after some steps, the walk is on a node of unspeci ed degree, then according to equation
(14) the probability that its next step takes it to a node with label (k, l) is wkl. In this case the probability that the
walk is not absorbed in the next step is.

So this argument yields precisely the same exponent as the rough one. We can obtain a better estimate of the exponent
by assuming that when averaged over many leaf walks, the occupation probabilities take values similar to those
attained by an non-absorbing walk in equilibrium. For traditional walks the equilibrium occupation probabilities are
proportional to the number of incoming links: knk/(cid:104)k(cid:105) [4]. For leaf walks the natural generalisation of this equilibrium
occupation probability is proportional to the number of non-leaf connections. So the wkl not only represent transition
probabilities, but when properly normalised can represent the occupation probabilities of (k, l) nodes for k   2.
Numerical investigations that track which sites are visited suggest that such an assumption is valid in the large (cid:104)k(cid:105)
limit. With the appropriate normalisation to ensure the correct sum of occupation probabilities over non-leaf nodes,
the estimate of the occupation probability of a (k, l) node is.
wkl
(1   e (cid:104)k(cid:105))
=
(k   l)qkl
(cid:104)k(cid:105)(1   e (cid:104)k(cid:105))2
(17)
The probability of stepping from a (k, l) node to another non-leaf node is simply (k   l)/k, so overall the probability
of surviving one step is.

k(cid:88)

(18)
In the limit of large (cid:104)k(cid:105) this reproduces the rough result for the exponent in equation (9), but as can be seen from
the continuous line in  gure 2, this prediction matches the simulation results slightly better.
B. Memoryless Approximation
Since the paths are typically short compared to the size of the network, the spirit of this paper is to use methods
that approximate the path enumeration to make it tractable. An interesting, though  awed, paper in this context is
that of Masuda and Konno [8]. These authors write recursion formulae for the return probabilities of a non-absorbing
walk to an arbitrary node using an approximation that takes memory into account within each backtrack, but regards
each separate backtrack as a new path. The approximation is expected to be successful at large (cid:104)k(cid:105). Unfortunately
the paper [8] does not take into account the factor of the number of links that weights the probability of  nding a
certain degree node at the end of a randomly chosen link, and this compromises their results. Nonetheless the defect
is simply remedied and their approach can be modi ed for our random walks between leaves.
FIG. 4: Diagrammatic representation of the recursion used in the memoryless approximation. The top diagram is for the  rst
passage probability without absorption, rn, and the lower diagram is for the probability of being absorbed at some other leaf,
qn. The dashed lines represent these quantities and the solid lines are single steps between nodes. The open circles are leaf
nodes and the solid circles are non-leaf nodes. The sum over partitions is represented with the dotted arc.
By considering the top diagram shown in  gure 4 the probability of  rst passage to a node after 2t steps without
being absorbed, rt, obeys the following recursion.

(19)

The sum is over all integer partitions of t including all possible orderings of those partitions. The signi cance of
the partitions is that they represent the length of each backtrack shown in  gure 4. In equation (19), this sum over
partitions is decomposed into a sum over the number of lobes or backtracks in the diagram (corresponding to the
order of the partition), and a sum over partitions into precisely this many lobes. The parameters ma are correctly
given by.

where the lower limit of the sum imposes the condition of no absorption and this is the constitutes the only di erence
in computing rt with [8]. The form (19) illustrates the nature of the approximation as the memoryless nature consists
in regarding each walk on a lobe as independent.
A generating function approach is useful and we write for these  rst passage probabilities without absorption.
R(x) =
rtxt
(21)
Later, when paths that are not of even length are taken into account, we will need to consider R(x2). In terms of
R(x) the recursion takes on a more convenient form than equation (19).
R(x) = x
ma+1 (R(x))a
(22)
The probability that a walk lasts t steps before being absorbed by a di erent leaf node, qt, also obeys a recursion
relation shown diagrammatically in the lower part of  gure 4. The recursion is slightly di erent for even and odd
values of t, but can be combined and is conveniently expressed in terms of the generating function.

The  rst coe cient is q1 = n1/(cid:104)k(cid:105) which for ER graphs is simply e (cid:104)k(cid:105). The parameters sa are de ned as.
In some cases, it could be argued that the lower limit of this sum ought to be increased, but to keep track of these
cases would be against the spirit of the approximation. For ER graphs, the parameters sa and ma are related by.
sa = sa 1   ma 1
(26)
While Masuda and Konno invert equation (22) to obtain explicit expressions for the  rst passage probabilities in
terms of sums over partitions [15], we have found using the recursion relations themselves to be numerically convenient
and speedy. Using algebraic manipulation software, the equation for the generating function (22) conveniently encodes
all the separate equations for each coe cient and can be solved quickly and accurately. The solution for R(x) can then
be used to provide values for the probabilities qt using the equation below. The combined probability of absorption
after t steps is the sum of the contributions from rt and qt where the  rst term only contributes for even length paths.

The second line is speci c to ER graphs as it uses the relationship between parameters in equation (26). At x = 1
this equation simpli es and by using the explicit forms of q1 = e (cid:104)k(cid:105) and s1 = 1   e (cid:104)k(cid:105) we  nd R(1) + Q(1) = 1. So
at the level of this approximation, leaf walks are never transient on ER graphs. Since the approximation is expected
to improve as (cid:104)k(cid:105) increases, and this is the regime in which transience is most likely to occur, the result provides
strong evidence that transience does not occur. The result for the full generating function is helpful as it avoids the
need to calculate the parameters sa, which is otherwise the most time consuming part of the solution. The alternative
approach of solving the generating function R(x) by iteration and then obtaining the coe cients from residues, works
for small t, but becomes slow and unstable at larger t.

Although this value is not very large, agreement is reasonable. The  rst three points are identical to the exact
prediction but later points tend to track the curve for odd length walks. At larger values of (cid:104)k(cid:105) the agreement is even
better. At (cid:104)k(cid:105) = 1, the predictions are successful for t < 10, but for longer paths, the theory fails to capture the
observed behaviour.
This approximation provides an improvement over the techniques used in the previous section as it contains in-
formation about backtracking paths. For smaller values of (cid:104)k(cid:105), where backtracks and memory e ects become more
important the approximation fails.
IV. SCALE FREE NETWORKS
Scale free networks (BA) [11] created though a growth process involving preferential attachment provide a popular
alternative model of random networks. We consider the simplest version of this system which according to the
classi cation of [11] is the m = 1 model with preferential attachment and with an initial network consisting of a pair
of nodes connected by a link. The growth process leads to a directed network with (cid:104)k(cid:105) = 2 and with 2/3 of the nodes
being leaves. The degree distribution is given by [17].
nk =
4
k(k + 1)(k + 2)
(29)
Though if we take into account the age of nodes, older nodes tend to have larger degree while most leaf nodes are
young. In general, these networks su er from strong  nite size e ects [18].
Due to the way in which they are created, this kind of scale free network is not homogeneous, has strong correlations
and in these respects is very di erent from the ER networks. The directed nature of the network is crucial in
understanding the correlations The fraction of nodes of degree k that attach to an ancestor node of degree l (the
degree of the ancestor, l, must be greater or equal to 2), is [17]
ekl =
4(l   1)

FIG. 6: The probability for random walks between leaves on a BA graph. Points with error bars are from simulation based on
20000 walks on each of 100 graphs of size 100000. The continuous line is a prediction based on labelling nodes and is explained
in the text.
Random walks on this network have no knowledge of the direction of the links, but a full analysis of the walk should
take this into account.
Numerical results are shown in  gure 6. There is no evidence for transience as the longest walk observed is much
smaller than the size of the network and shows no change as that size is varied. Exponential decay of the random walk
probabilities is not apparent for this network. This is in contrast to ER networks above the percolation threshold.
In  gure 2, the curves for graphs with (cid:104)k(cid:105) below the threshold, do not display exponential decay, but this should be
attributed to a  nite size e ect from individual clusters. The BA network is simply connected and investigations of
the dependence on network size allow us to rule out  nite size as a cause of the curvature. Longer paths are more
likely than would be expected from a  xed exponential decay. This is due to the correlations and non homogeneous
nature of the BA network. Krapivsky and Redner[17] compute the age dependence of the degree distribution and
support the notion of a highly connected old core to the network with high degree nodes. Long paths access this old
core and the random walks that access this region tend to stay there and are less likely to be absorbed.
A. Labelling according to (k, l)
The framework a orded by labelling nodes by (k, l) is helpful to make predictions for BA networks despite reserva-
tions about its accuracy in the context of ER networks. In this section we compute the probability that a randomly
selected node on this BA network has degree k and l links to leaf nodes. In fact, to simplify notation, we compute
qkp where p = k   l is the number of links to non-leaf nodes. By considering the growth process, we  nd a recursion
relation for the expected number of labeled nodes which when expressed as probabilities becomes.
(2k   p + 2) qkp = (k   1) qk 1p + (k   p + 1) qkp 1
(31)
When combined with initial conditions q11 = n1 and qkk+1 = qk0 = 0 this di erence equations allows all higher terms
to be computed. However, an explicit solution requires some work.
Based on explorations for small values of k, p we partially disentangle the two indices by writing.
qkp = Pp 1(k)
(k   1)!
(2k + 1)!!
  Qp 2(k)
(k   1)!
(2k)!!
Where Pn(k) and Qn(k) are polynomials in k of degree n. These obey the following di erence equations.
(2k   p + 2) Pp 1(k) = (2k + 1) Pp 1(k   1) + (k   p + 1) Pp 2(k)
(2k   p + 2) Qp 2(k) = (2k) Qp 2(k   1) + (k   p + 1) Qp 3(k)
The  rst equation can be solved immediately to give.
Pp 1(k) =
2
(p   1)!
(k + p   2)!
k!
(cid:0)k + 2(p   1)2(cid:1)
(32)

While the second equation has the more complicated solution.
Qp 2(k) =

1
(j   1)!
(k + p   2j + 1)!
(p   2j)!(k   j + 1)!
The resulting qkp match numerical values obtained from generating many BA networks. They also obey the following.

On BA networks there is only one connected component and there are no walks of length one step. The probability
of a randomly selected leaf node connecting to a (k, p) node is.

With this information we can now predict the probability of a walk of length 2 steps.

The  rst line exposes the separate factors for the transition and for the random walk, while the second line shows that
this can be expressed in terms of the sums computed above in equation (39). Numerical simulations on 100 graphs of
size 105 observe 0.57   0.02,  tting the prediction well.
We can proceed to estimate the probability of walks of length 3 and over by extending this argument. However,
this requires knowledge of the correlations between the (k, p) values of linked nodes. We have not computed this four
index quantity, but have made some estimates using the degree correlations in equation (30). These estimates are not
accurate and we do not present them here.
Even though  gure 6 clearly shows a curve, we can use (5) to estimate the survival probability. We expect the
analogy of wkl, namely pqkp/(cid:104)p(cid:105), to represent the transition probability to a (k, l) site. Here the mean number of
connections to non-leaf nodes is given by (cid:104)p(cid:105) = 4/3, so the probability of making a further step without absorption is.

(42)
The decay exponent that this argument suggests is therefore a constant   = log 2. We do not show this prediction in
 gure 6 as it is not very accurate and we can obtain a better prediction following the reasoning used for ER networks
and leading to the estimate of the survival probability given in equation (18). To do this we assume that pqkp/(cid:104)p(cid:105)
can be regarded as an occupation probability for non-leaf nodes. A factor of 2 is needed for correct normalisation and
probability of survival on the next step is.

(48 2   419) = 0.570219 . . .
(43)
We have not discovered any reason for the appearance of exactly the same factor as in equation (42), and it seems to
be a coincidence.
If we assume that the argument holds for all length paths, and taking into account the lack of transience to
normalise, we can predict the following form.
(1    )
 2

pt =
(44)
This form is shown in  gure 6 and is provides a surprisingly good  t for shorter paths. As explained above, longer
paths are a ected by the correlations, enter the region of old nodes, and are more likely than this approximation
predicts.
B. Other approaches
We have not attempted to extend the memoryless approximation along the lines of the one described in section
III B for ER networks as the level of complication appears to be unwarranted. Such an approximation would have to
take into account the correlations between node degrees and to do this needs to delve into the underlying directed
nature of the BA graph. The return probabilities would depend on the degree of the originating node.
V. CONCLUSION
This study of the problem of random walks between leaf nodes of random networks was initiated by the desire to
model internet tra c, but it turns out that these walks probe network structure in a way that is not possible for
traditional non-absorbing walks. The mean  rst passage time is a natural observable for non-absorbing walks, but
to characterise classes of graph it must be averaged over all pairs of nodes and this reduces the information it can
provide about the non-homogeneity of a network. By contrast, the random walks between leaves studied here provide
a natural subset of nodes over which the mean  rst passage time can be averaged and this can give information
about the heterogeneity of the network and the extent to which edge nodes are connected to the rest of the network.
The clearest example of the way that walks between leaves can probe network structure was the distinction between
exponential decay of the probability distribution of the length of the walk on homogeneous ER networks and the non-
exponential decay for heterogeneous BA networks. This however leads to a conundrum: the internet is hierarchical,
yet the probability distribution of time-to-live (TTL) values captured on the internet does not display any systematic
deviation from exponential. This may indicate limits to the utility of random walks representing internet tra c.
Our analytic attempts to predict the probability of given length walks have relied on a variety of techniques. For
short paths we have been able to enumerate, or devise approximations that allow such enumerations. For longer paths
we have had some success with ER networks by assuming that the equilibrium occupation probabilities of a node are
proportional to the number of its non-leaf links. Together with results for the proportion of (k, l) nodes, this approach
gives some useful predictions for BA networks but does not capture the non-trivial decay of the walk due to intrinsic
correlations in the network.
