ABSTRACT
Subscriber churn remains a top challenge for wireless carri-
ers. These carriers need to understand the determinants of
churn to con dently apply e ective retention strategies to
ensure their pro tability and growth. In this paper, we look
at the e ect of peer in uence on churn and we try to dis-
entangle it from other e ects that drive simultaneous churn
across friends but that do not relate to peer in uence. We
analyze a random sample of roughly 10 thousand subscribers
from large dataset from a major wireless carrier over a pe-
riod of 10 months. We apply survival models and generalized
propensity score to identify the role of peer in uence. We
show that the propensity to churn increases when friends do
and that it increases more when many strong friends churn.
Therefore, our results suggest that churn managers should
consider strategies aimed at preventing group churn. We
also show that survival models fail to disentangle homophily
from peer in uence over-estimating the e ect of peer in u-
ence.
INTRODUCTION
1.
Over the past two decades, wireless telecommunications mar-
kets experienced rapid change and strong technological growth
from 2G to 4G. According to [16], 6.8 billion mobile sub-
scriptions worldwide saturate the wireless market. In par-
allel, deregulation opened up markets to multiple entrants
supporting both competition and technological innovation.
Consequently, carriers need to invest heavily in upgrading
their networks to provide quality communications and novel
services as well as to ensure that they healthily pro t from
existing subscribers. However, subscribers have many providers
to choose from and can ever more easily transfer from one
provider to another as more information about products and
services abounds and switching costs reduce [5].
Churn rates measure the proportion of subscribers discon-
tinuing service during a certain period of time. As reported
by wireless carriers across the world, average monthly churn
rates vary between 1.5% and 5% [33, 17, 8]. In other words,
wireless carriers can lose 20% of their subscriber base ev-
ery year, which poses signi cant challenges for pro tabil-
ity and growth. Subscriber churn may represent signi cant
economic loss. This loss can be estimated by multiplying
the average cost to acquire a new subscriber by the number
of subscribers that churn. With average acquisition costs
reaching $600 per subscriber churn may cost the wireless in-
dustry billions of dollars every year [3]. On the other hand,
keeping an existing subscriber is generally much cheaper
and easier. [33] showed that acquiring a new subscriber can
be  ve times harder than retaining an existing one because
the latter is less sensitive to both price and sales referrals.
Meanwhile, improving subscriber retention can help wire-
less carriers increase margins [8]. Therefore, e ective sub-
scriber churn management becomes a priority for many tele-
com managers as to ensure the sustainable growth of their
companies.
Wireless carriers aim at controlling churn through active
subscriber retention campaigns. For this purpose, they proac-
tively identify subscribers with high propensity to churn,
evaluate the underlying reasons for churn and devise strate-
gies to prevent it. The perplexing nature of churn, however,
makes it very di cult to explain and address churn in an
e cient and comprehensive manner. Subscribers may churn
for many di erent reasons: they may be unsatis ed with
the quality of service; they may get attracted by competi-
tors that provide lower prices; they may decide to acquire
a new handset or service that is not currently provided by
their carrier. Thus, wireless carriers can hardly provide one
single solution to prevent all potential churners from leav-
ing. Therefore, understanding the complexity of the churn
problem and disentangling the role of the several factors
that can trigger it is fundamental to design sound retention
strategies.
In this paper, we look at one such complexity associated with
churn. We study the e ect of peer in uence on churn. If
churn is contagious then churn can snowball quickly leading
many subscribers to leave the carrier, specially when social
networks are dense, as they locally tend to be in the case of
wireless services. We apply survival analysis and generalized
propensity score to separate peer in uence from homophily
and measure the e ect of the former. We perform our em-
pirical analysis on a massive dataset from a major European
wireless carrier that shared call detail records (CDRs) with
us. We show how churn increases with friends  churn, a re-
sult suggesting that churn managers should prevent group
churn instead of looking at churn on an individual basis.
2. RELATED WORKS
2.1 Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)
Many researchers have proposed that looking at the value
of existing subscribers is essential because investing in all
subscribers will be ine cient [14]. [28] introduced the CLV
model in the wireless industry to estimate the e ect of re-
tention campaigns based on CLV. CLV models help under-
stand subscriber value and provide wireless carriers insights
to build cost-e ective retention strategies targeted to sub-
scribers with high CLV and low loyalty. [11] showed that the
pro t of the wireless carrier is a function of the total sub-
scriber lifetime value.
In their theoretical CLV model for
the wireless telecommunication industry, the probability of
a subscriber to churn is treated as a parameter in the CLV
function used to determine how long the subscriber will stay
in the network generating future cash  ows. Another gen-
eralized CLV model proposed by [9] identi ed churners as
subscribers with decreasing CLV. Therefore, the probability
of churn is central to the notion of CLV and thus under-
standing churn is paramount to correctly measure CLV.
2.2 Churn Prediction
Today, wireless carriers gather wealthy data deemed use-
ful to perform churn analysis. Numerous data mining tech-
niques have been applied to transform these raw data into
useful knowledge. [13] described the general framework for
this purpose: (i) identify discriminatory features that can
di erentiate a subscriber with high risk of churn from other
loyal subscribers; (ii) extract data from identi ed features;
(iii) select the appropriate data mining techniques to build
descriptive or predictive models; (iv) evaluate the perfor-
mance of these models according to speci ed criteria, e.g.
lift curves. Extensive research has been done on churn pre-
diction in wireless network. Refer to [25] and [32] for com-
prehensive reviews on the application of di erent algorithms
to churn prediction and prevention.
Three disadvantages of pure data mining techniques are worth
noting though. First, although many models and algorithms
seem to provide satisfactory accuracy in identifying churn-
ers, the results obtained dependent not only on method but
also on the data used and the features considered by re-
searchers. For example, both [24] and [14] used logistic re-
gressions and neural networks to predict churn. The for-
mer found that neural networks outperformed logistic re-
gression. However, the latter concluded otherwise. Second,
many data mining algorithms are like a  black box , which
lack interpretability precluding us from understanding the
true determinants of subscriber churn. As a result, an agent
in a call center might be asked to call a certain subscriber
because she is likely to churn. However, very little might
have been said to this agent about the underlying reasons
that may lead the subscriber to churn, which clearly di cul-
ties the interaction with her. Third, a number of statistical
based benchmarking measures of performance for data min-
ing algorithms do not directly yield optimal results in terms
of pro t maximization from the practitioners  perspective.
[31] proposed a pro t-centric performance criterion focusing
on the fraction of subscribers that generate the most pro t
and showed that this approach yielded outcomes di erent
from the ones resting on the best approaches as evaluated
by statistically based performance measures.
2.3 Social In uence
Advances in studying the e ect of social in uence on sub-
scriber churn in wireless networks have received much atten-
tion in recent times. [6] tried to learn whether the propensity
of a subscriber to churn depends on the number of friends
that have already churned. This hypothesis is based on
premise that a few key individuals may lead to strong  word-
of-mouth  e ects. These individuals may in uence their
friends to churn, who in turn spread the message to others.
So they identi ed likely churners as those subscribers whose
friends have already churned, using a spreading activation-
based technique. A set of churners iteratively di use the
message to other subscribers. Then a subscriber churns once
the accumulated level of in uence reaches a certain thresh-
old. [7] used Markov Logic Networks and propositionaliza-
tion to develop a predictive model for churn. They also
con rmed that  word-of-mouth  has a signi cant impact on
subscriber s churn decisions. [26] demonstrated that by in-
tegrating social factors such as in uence from churners into
machine learning models can enhance the prediction perfor-
mance. However, correlation in the behavior among people
who share social ties can be explained by both peer in u-
ence and their inherent similarities   homophily [22]. Work
that identi es contagious churn separating it from confound-
ing e ects such as homophily (friends tend to exhibit sim-
ilar behavior) is still limited. The contribution of our pa-
per is to analyze contagious churn avoiding misattributing
homophily to contagion, or/and vice versa, which typically
leads to overestimate the latter.
Along these lines, [21] provides a study close to ours, which
uses the same dataset to identify peer in uence in the the
adoption of the iPhone 3G. In their case, they show that
peer in uence led to roughly 14% of the observed iPhone
adoption during the  rst year after the introduction of this
handset in the market. A number of other studies on the
identi cation of peer in uence in the presence of confound-
ing e ects in other networked contexts have been proposed[1,
4, 19, 30, 20]. For example, [2] used dynamic propensity
score matching (PSM) to estimate the e ect of contagion
in the adoption of an online service by analyzing a commu-
nity of instant messenger users. Their  ndings suggest that
homophily accounted for much of the adoption previously
perceived as peer in uence. However, they dichotomize the
treatment to use PSM and thus are unable to explore the
heterogeneity in treatment levels.
3. DATA AND DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS
We partnered with a major European wireless carrier, here-
inafter called EURMO, whig gave us access to its Call De-
tailed Records (CDRs) between August 2008 and May 2009.
For each call we know the caller and the callee, the du-
ration and time of the call and the id of the cell tower
used to route the call. Subscribers are identi ed by their
anonymized phone number. For each subscriber, we know
their provider and tari  plan at all times. There are roughly
4 million EURMO subscribers in our dataset.
Understanding subscriber churn with prepaid plans is quite
di erent from working with postpaid subscribers. First, we
have very limited socio-demographic information on pre-
paid subscribers. Second, the usage pattern of prepaid sub-
scribers is more irregular than that of postpaid subscribers.
Third, prepaid subscribers churn by ceasing usage whereas
postpaid subscribers explicitly inform the carrier when they
intend to do so. We use the standard in the industry, which
is also followed by EURMO and assumed that a prepaid sub-
scriber churns if she places no calls for three of consecutive
months.

Table 1: List of covariates extracted from the EURMO network. Descriptive statistics are performed for the
our random sample (columns [1] and [2]), churners (columns [3] and [4]) and non-churners (columns [5] and
[6]), respectively. Column [7] tests the hypothesis that the means between churners and non-churners are
similar.
We use a random sample of 10 thousand subscribers. Two
subscribers are called friends if they exchange at least one
call in each and every calendar month. We trim from our
random sample subscribers with very high degree, which
are likely to represent customer service and PBX machines,
and with no degree (some subscribers purchase a SIM card
but never use it to make calls). We are left with 8,345
subscribers in our sample. We observe network dynamics
over time, namely new subscribers join EURMO and ex-
isting subscribers leave EURMO every month. Moreover,
subscribers call and/or text di erent friends over time. We
aggregate individual subscriber usage and structural prop-
erties at the monthly level in our analysis. Table 1 shows de-
scriptive statistics for covariates used in our study. Over the
period of analysis, the subscribers in our sample placed 3.75
million calls and 1,191 of them churned, which amounts to
an average monthly churn rate of 2.04%. On average, users
in our sample have 8.4 friends. Number of friends is the
only time-independent covariate used in our study, which
we compute across the whole panel of data available to us.
This allows us to identify  sticky  friends purging spurious
short-lived connections.
We  nd that churners have much less usage, both in terms
of number of calls and airtime, and fewer friends than non-
churners. These di erences are statistically signi cant as
shown by a t-test in column [7] of this table. Since we know
the tari  plan each subscriber holds, we are able to calcu-
late an estimate for monthly expenses (in Euros). Churn-
ers contribute with 11% of the revenues at EURMO. On
average, they spend 7.5 euros less per month than non-
churners. We observe that all subscribers have much more
usage within the network. This is because EURMO operates
under a Sender-Pays-All regime and interconnection charges
are added to every call, which EURMO passes, partially, to
consumers making calls outside the network more expensive.
We are particularly interested in the association between
number of friends who churn and the propensity to churn.
Therefore, we use n-call f rd churn, the friends who churn
that exchange at least n calls with the ego in the same cal-
endar month. We  nd that 343 out of 1,191 (29%) churners
and that 3,197 out of 7,154 (45%) non-churners have at least
one friend that churned during the period of analysis. Table
1 shows that on average subscribers see 1.13 friends churn,
0.56 and 0.20 friends churn that exchange at least 3 and 5
calls, respectively, with the ego in the same calendar month.
4. CHURN DYNAMICS
The panel structure of our data can be analyzed using sur-
vival analysis to determine the impact of time-varying co-
variates on churn [18]. Survival analysis also allows for con-
trolling for some unobserved individual-level heterogeneity,
i.e., some subscribers are more prone to churn for reasons

Table 2: Parameter estimates for Cox PH frailty models on f rd churn at three thresholds: 1-call (columns [1]
and [4]), 3-call (columns [2] and [5]) and 5-call (columns [3] and [6])
that are not captured in our data (e.g. marketing campaigns
by competitors). We employ a Cox Proportional Hazard
(PH) model with frailty to estimate the churn hazard rate
as:
h(t, xi, x(t 1)
i
) =  ih0(t)exp[ xi +  x(t 1)
i
]
i
where h(t, xi, x(t 1)
) is the churn hazard for subscriber i
at time t,  i is the Gamma distributed frailty that repre-
sents the individual-level random e ect, h0(t) is the non-
paramatric baseline hazard function, xi and x(t 1)
include
time-independent and time-varying covariates at time t, such
as usage and friends  churn. We introduce a time-lag on the
latter covariates because, similarly to epidemiology cases,
there is an induction and latency period between a friend s
churn and the ego s churn. Moreover, using lagged covariates
obviates simultaneity problems with our estimation. Finally,
we also introduce monthly dummies to control for seasonal
e ects on churn, such as promotions o ered by competitors
over the summer or during Christmas.
i
We count the number of friends who churn that exchange
at least n calls with the ego, as explained in the previous
section. We vary n in {1, 3, 5} and use f rd churn to de-
note the covariate of interest. Table 2 shows the results
obtained. The coe cients on f rd churn are statistically
signi cant across all model speci cations. Note that coe -
cients for n = 5 are larger but this can only mildly hint at
the fact that churn from stronger friends is more relevant for
the ego because standard errors are high. The other covari-
ates behave as expected, in particular, higher expenditure
leads to more churn. Yet, we recall that our goal in this pa-
per is not to develop a predictive model of churn. Instead,
we are interested in identifying the role of peer in uence on
churn. The additional covariates in our study are not nec-
essarily used to predict churn.
Instead, they are used to
characterize the behavior of consumers with respect to how
they use cellphone service so that we can, in the next sec-
tion, compare similar users to try to isolate the e ect of peer
in uence.
These results show that the more friends churn the more
likely the ego will churn. For example, 0.375 for the  rst
model shown in this table indicates that if one more friend
churns then the ego s likelihood of churn vs. no churn in-
creases by exp(0.375) or 45%. The 0.215 (0.458) in the sec-
ond (third) model indicates that if one more friend with
whom the ego exchanges 3 (5) or more calls in the same
calendar month churns then the ego s likelihood of churn
vs. no-churn increases by exp(0.215) (exp(0.458)) or 24%
(58%). To better understand the role of friends  churn on
the ego s churn we perform Monte Carlo simulations for the
relative hazard of churn vs. no-churn using the coe cients
and variances of f rd churn estimated using the six Cox PH
models in this table. Figure 1 shows how the relative hazard
increases with the number of friends that churn.
5. EFFECT OF FRIENDS  CHURN
pute the average conditional expectation for the e ect of
treatment. This polynomial approximation of degree two,
with an interaction term between treatment intensity and
propensity score, allows for a better understanding of the
non-linear e ects of treatment than linear regression.
5.1 Treatment Exposure and Post-Treatment
Periods
Our dataset spans 10 months of data. However, we need to
observe subscribers for 3 months to determine whether they
churn. So, in fact, we are limited to a panel with 7 time pe-
riods. As discussed earlier, contagious churn is studied after
the exposure to friends  churn friend during an induction
and latency period. Therefore, we split the period of anal-
ysis into two intervals:
i) the Treatment Exposure Period
(TEP), during which egos observe, and count, their friends
churning, represented by f rd churn; ii) the Post-Treatment
Period (PTP), during which we observe whether the ego
churns. There are several options to de ne TEP and PTP.
However, we need each of these intervals to be su ciently
large. TEP needs to be su ciently large so that we can
observe treatment and, in particular, several intensities of
treatment. PTP also needs to be su ciently large so that
we can observe outcomes and, in particular, outcomes trig-
gered by treatment. Therefore, natural choices for TEP and
PTP are to include months {1, 2, 3, 4} in the former and
months {5, 6, 7} in the latter. Another option is to include
months {1, 2, 3} in TEP and months {4, 5, 6, 7} in PTP. Be-
low we show results using the former de nitions. Results for
the latter are qualitatively similar and are available upon
request.
ii) T2: 2 or 3 friends churn;
5.2 Balancing Covariates
We consider 3 levels of treatment intensity: i) T1: at most
one friend churns;
iii) T3:
more than 3 friends churn. We compute a propensity score
for each subscriber and for each treatment intensity. Then
we test whether the conditional means of the subscribers 
covariates given the propensity score are di erent for sub-
scribers with each treatment intensity and subscribers with
other treatment intensities.
If the latter are similar then
subscribers with di erent treatment intensities are not dif-
ferent in other aspects of their behavior, which allows us to
better associate changes in the outcome (the ego s churn) to
changes in the treatment (friends  churn).
The key for any GPS analysis to identify believable e ects
is to control for the important covariates. Given the rich-
ness of our dataset, we are fortunate to observe covariates
that, allegedly, capture most of what is important to control
for to study contagious churn. First, we control for tenure
with EURMO, thus making sure that we take the life cycle
of the subscriber within EURMO into account. Otherwise,
it would be unreasonable to compare new consumers to old
consumers as the latter typically have developed a di er-
ent level of trust with EURMO, enjoy di erent prices and,
most importably for the issue of churn, experience di er-
ent switching costs because their lock-in periods are more
likely to have expired. Second, we control for number of
calls placed and for the percentage of calls to other net-
works. These covariates together capture well the level of
cell usage. Otherwise, it would be unreasonable to compare

els 1-3 in Table 2. Ribbons represent 95% con dence
intervals. 10,000 simulations were run per value of
f rd churn
Propensity Score Matching (PSM) is a widely applied method
to evaluate the e ect of treatments on outcomes of interest
[27, 23] with observational studies. In particular, when the
assignment of treatment is not random, selection bias arise
because the characteristics of treated and untreated units
can di er. The propensity score, de ned as the probability
of receiving treatment conditional on observed confounding
covariates that correlate with both the outcome and treat-
ment, summarizes all the relevant information available to
the researcher into a single scalar value. Conditioning on
this value, the distributions of the observed characteristics
across treated and untreated units become more similar and,
therefore, unlikely to drive di erences in outcomes. Hence,
PSM helps reduce bias. However, PSM still fails to pro-
vide full causal interpretations because it does not control
for unobserved e ects [29]. In any case, and when random-
ized experiments are unavailable, using PSM increases our
con dence when reporting e ects, in particular, when one
controls for the most important characteristics of the units
under analysis.
Extensions of PSM to cases with continuous treatments [15,
12] have been proposed in the literature under the umbrella
of Generalized Propensity Score (GPS). GPS provides a
dose-response function (DRF) that measures the relation-
ship between the outcome of interest and the intensity of
treatment. In our case, friends  churn (the treatment) is not
binary but rather an integer. Egos can be subject to di er-
ent amounts of treatment as they see more or fewer friends
churn. Di erent treatment intensities can have di erent ef-
fects on the ego s churn (the outcome). Therefore, we use
GPS to explore our case of contagious churn in more detail.
Details of the mechanics beyond GPS can be found in [12].
For sake of space, we only note the following modeling op-
tions: i) the distribution of friends  churn is far from normal,
therefore, we followed a parametric solution, as proposed in
[10], and allow the intensity of treatment to be skewed to-
wards zero, using an exponential functional form whose pa-
rameters are estimated by maximum likelihood; ii) we use a
polynomial approximation of order two to regress outcomes
on treatments and propensity scores, from which we com-
subscribers with low usage to subscribers with high usage
as their engagement with cell phone service is likely very
di erent.
Third, we control for expenditure. While this covariate is
highly correlated to usage, controlling for expenditure allows
for reducing selection bias introduced by having subscribers
choose their tari  plan.
Indeed, consumers with di erent
levels of income, and di erent tari  plans, can pay di erent
amounts of money for the same level of call usage. Such dif-
ferences could, therefore, be attributed to usage of services
other than calling, such as data. Ensuring that both num-
ber of calls and expenditure are similar across subscribers
allows us to be more con dent that we are comparing sub-
scribers that use their cell phone similarly, even for services
whose usage we do not observe in our dataset. Finally, we
control for the number of friends to make sure that we com-
pare subscribers with similar social circles. Otherwise, it
would be unreasonable to compare subscribers that can re-
ceive many signals (friends churning) from many friends with
subscribers with very few friends can only obtain very lim-
ited signals.
We generate results for n-callf rd churn for n = 1, 3, 5. Ta-
ble 3 shows how the adjustment by conditioning on the
propensity score balances these covariates for the case of
n = 1. We can see that most covariates are di erent be-
fore adjustment but become statistically similar at the 5%
leave after adjustment. Balancing for other values of n and
for (T EP, P T P ) = ({1, 2, 3},{4, 5, 6, 7}) yield qualitatively
similar results, that is, biases are signi cantly reduced after
adjustment.

5.3 The Effect of Treatment
We use GPS to estimate the conditional mean for the ef-
fect of treatment, friends  churn, on the outcome, the ego s
churn. We do not report the regression results here, for
sake of space and because the estimated coe cients have
no direct meaning [12]. Still, we notice that the coe cients
from regressing outcomes on our second degree polynomial
on treatment intensities and propensity scores are all sta-
tistically di erent from zero at least at the 10% level. We
estimate the dose response function and derive the marginal
treatment e ect relative to having no friends that churn. We
report marginal treatment e ects up to  ve friends churning,
which covers 99.9% of the observations in our dataset.
Figure 2 shows the results obtained for n = 1, 3, 5. We ob-
serve that having more friends churn increases the likelihood
of churn for any n considered in our analysis. This provides
evidence of peer in uence in churn in wireless networks. Fur-
thermore, we observe that when considering the churn from
3-call and 5-call friends the marginal e ect of treatment,
that is the e ect of having one more of these friends churn,
increases with the number of friends that churn. This pro-
vides some evidence that churn from stronger friends might
be more important. In particular, with GPS, we see that for
treatment intensity T3 (that is, more than 3 friends churn),
the 95% con dence interval for 1-call no longer overlaps with
the 95% con dence interval for 5-call, which allows us to
claim that the e ect of 5-call friends  churn has a large ef-
fect than that of 1-call friends  churn when enough friends
churn. This is a sensible result showing that enough strong
friends churning makes a signi cant di erence on the ego s
probability to churn.
Finally, note that the marginal e ect from the GPS analysis
is not directly comparable to the relative hazard from the
survival analysis. Yet, we can see that the e ect of one
additional friend churning is at most 10% in the GPS results.
This means that homophily is likely to play a signi cant role
in the correlation of churn across friends that the survival
analysis confounds with peer in uence. GPS reduces the
bias in estimating the e ect of peer in uence by comparing
across similar subscribers. This takes away the e ect of all
the homophily captured by the covariates that we control
for in computing the propensity score.

6. CONCLUSIONS
Retaining existing subscribers is of vital importance for wire-
less carriers to survive in today s dynamic and competitive
mobile market. As such, understanding the determinants
of churn becomes a priority. Carriers need to con dently
identify potential churners to apply appropriate retention
strategies aimed at reducing subscriber loss. However, the
perplexing and evolving nature of churn still poses signi cant
challenges to churn managers. In this paper, we look at one
of such complexities. We examine the e ect of peer in uence
on churn. We do so empirically using a real world dataset
of cell phone activity, from which we extract a set of co-
variates measuring cell phone usage, tenure with the carrier
and network structural properties such as number of friends.
We analyze a random sample of roughly 10 thousand sub-
scribers. For each subscriber in our sample we de ne the
number of friends that churn with whom the subscriber ex-
changes 1, 3 or 5 calls in the same calendar month. These
di erent de nitions allow for estimating the e ect of churn
from strong vs. weak friends.
In a preliminary analysis, we  t survival models to our data
to correlate the cumulative number of friends that churned
up to the previous month and the ego s likelihood of churn
in the current month. An additional friend that churns in-
creases the hazard of churn in at least 24%. In a deeper anal-
ysis, we use Generalized Propensity Score (GPS) matching
to help reduce the potential selection bias across subscribers
in our sample and estimate the e ect of contagion. With
GPS we can compare subscribers that are similar in a num-
ber of relevant covariates and di er only in the intensity of
their treatment. The latter is the number of friends that
churned. Some subscribers do not have friends that churned
while others see as much as 5 friends churn over a period of
7 months. We control for the subscribers tenure with the
carrier, cell phone usage, monthly expenditure and the size
of the social network. These are the relevant covariates to
capture the subscribers behavior with respect to cell phone
service and choice of provider. In this framework, we asso-
ciate di erences in the intensity of treatment to di erences
in the outcome of interest. In our case, the latter is the ego s
propensity to churn.
We  nd that the ego s propensity to churn increases with
the number of friends that churn and in particular with in-
creased numbers of strong friends churning. With GPS, we
 nd that the marginal e ect of an additional friend churning
is at best 10%. This means that homophily is likely to drive
a signi cant amount of the correlation between churn and
friends  churn that a simple survival analysis is unable to
disentangle. With GPS we show that the role of peer in u-
ence is still signi cant in wireless networks: when someone
churns from the our carrier, other people may do so due to
peer in uence. This result, which may well represent a loss
of 10% in revenues for the carrier due to peer in uence in
churn, suggests that churn managers should consider strate-
gies aimed at preventing group churn instead of looking at
subscribers on an individual basis. Finally, we stress that
our paper puts together a methodology to measure peer in-
 uence in social networks that can be used in other contexts
such as learning about the e ect of word-of-mouth in the
dissemination of new products or services.
