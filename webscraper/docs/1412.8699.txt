particular environment. 
Decision  latitude  is  the  ability  to  make  work-related 
decisions  [Karasek  1979].  Rules  create  boundaries 
that 
determine the decision latitude of the individual with respect to 
a particular  activity.  Low decision  latitude can be associated 
with  adverse  health  consequences,  such  as  coronary  heart 
disease  [Kuper  &  Marmot  2003],  due  to  increased  workplace 
stress. 
  Measuring  decision  latitude  or  the  distance  an

Breaking a rule involves crossing a boundary established by 
the rule.  Many boundary crossings are done to serve the larger 
goals of an organization [Umphress & Humphries 2011] or to 
maintain safety, order, or equality [Verkuyten et al 1994]. In a 
survey  of  over  2,000  executive  assistants  [Klieman  1996],  it 
was found that:  
   10% destroyed or removed damaging information; 
   6.5%  wrote  documents  with  misleading  or 
information; and 
false 
   5.1% falsified vouchers or expense accounts. 
All of this activity was performed by employees to benefit their 
bosses  and/or  their  organizations.    Such  organizationally 
motivated boundary crossings may be the more frequent class 
of  boundary  crossing  and  may  be  indicative  of  low  decision 
latitude  and  perhaps  over-regulation.    For  example,  if  a 
neighborhood  has  stop  signs  on  every  corner,  it  will  increase 
the number of stop signs that are ignored.  Frequent boundary 
crossings  effectively  remove  those  boundaries  and  create 
opportunities for insider threats to increase their latitude. 
An insider can be defined as a current or former employee, 
contractor,  or  business  partner  who  has  or  had  authorized 
access  to  an  organization.    Likewise,  an  insider  threat  can  be 
defined  as  an 
intentionally  exceeded  or 
intentionally  used  their  access  in  a  manner  that  negatively 
affected  the  organization  [Silowesh  &  Nicoll  2013].    This 
definition  excludes  accidents, 
incompetence,  or  whistle-
blowers.    For  example,  Chelsea  Manning  was  intentionally 
trying  to  do  harm  to  the  United  States  and  would  fall  well

Abstract   Rules,  regulations,  and  policies  are  the  basis  of 
civilized  society  and  are  used  to  coordinate  the  activities  of 
individuals who have a variety of goals and purposes. History has

 INTRODUCTION  
Rules, regulations, and policies coordinate the activities of 
individuals who have a variety of goals and purposes [Brennan 
& Buchanan 1988] and are the basis of civilized society.  Rules 
are  the  primary  tool  for  creating  safe,  secure,  and  fair 
environments  for  individuals,  organizations,  and  communities 
[Schauer  1991].    Rules  work  by  establishing  acceptable 
boundaries for activities.  The space between the boundaries is 
the  latitude  individuals  have  to  perform  activities.    Over-
regulation  (too  many  rules)  provides  insufficient  latitude  for 
individuals to accomplish their activities.   History has taught 
us  that  over-regulated  economies  have  difficulty  competing  
[Shore 1998].  Under-regulation (too few rules) is also bad and 
can to lead to crisis.  In particular,  if the spell of no crisis is 
long enough, the regulation level may drop to zero, despite the 
fact that the socially optimal regulation level remains positive  
[Aizenman  2009].    This  implies  an  optimal  number  of  rules 
that avoids these two extremes [Barro 1986].  This paper seeks 
to develop models that qualitatively illustrate this behavior and 
can be used as a starting point for a more detailed, quantitative

within the insider threat definition.   Edward Snowden believes 
he  is  a  whistle-blower  while  the  United  States  Intelligence 
Community believes he is an insider threat. 
One  of  the  main  goals  of  an  insider  threat  is  to  increase 
their  decision  latitude.    This  can  be  accomplished  using  a 
standard OODA loop [Boyd 1996]:  
Observe boundaries that are being crossed, 
Orient themselves to cross those boundaries,  
Decide to cross those boundaries, and 
Act on the new latitude they have achieved. 
Through this process an insider threat elevates their privileges; 
gains knowledge about control measures; and may be able to 
bypass security measures designed to prevent, detect, or react 
to unauthorized access [Myers et al 2009].  A typical example 
is an insider acquiring a co-workers password [Claycomb et al 
2013].  In addition, an insider threat can be defined as an entity 
that violates a security policy using legitimate access [Bishop 
&  Gates  2008].  In  an  over-regulated  environment,  frequent 
boundary crossing by normal individuals allows the insider to 
increase their decision latitude by observing and mimicking the 
same behavior. 
Technological  measures  for  addressing  insider  threats  are 
an  active  area  of  research. 
is  better 
cryptographic  solutions  [Yakoubov  et  al  2014]  that  add 
limitation  to  the  use  of  information.    The  costs  of  these 
approaches are a key aspect of their adoption and there is active 
research to develop technologies that minimize their limitations 
[Kepner et al 2014]. 
  One  approach 
 Given the importance and cost implementing of rules this 
work  attempts  to  provide  models  for  estimating  the  optimal 
number of rules in the context of an insider threat.  This work 
follows  a  two-step  approach.    Step  1  is  a  simple  Toy  Model 
based  on  a  1D  concept  of  latitude.    The  Toy  Model  allows 
simple  estimates  of  the  impact  of  rules  on  latitude  and 
illustrates 
the  key  concepts  of  over-regulation,  under-
regulation,  and  a  tipping-point  between  these  two  regimes.  
Step  2  changes  the  terminology  of  the  Toy  Model  to 
correspond to a Percolation Model.  Percolation is widely use 
model in theoretical physics for understanding a wide range of 
phenomena.  The Percolation Model leverages over 100,000+ 
journal  articles  on  percolation  [Stuaffer  &  Aharony  1992], 
critical  phenomena  [Hohenberg  &  Halperin  1977],  phase 
transitions [Sinai 1982], and the renormalization group [Wilson 
1975,  Binney et al 1992] and allows rapid generalization of the 
Toy  Model  to  more  complex  models  that  have  already  been 
well  studied.    Finally,  and  perhaps  most  importantly,  the 
behavior  of  the  Percolation  Model  has  been  shown  to  be 
similar to that of many more complex models. Thus, the Toy 
Model is capturing the essence of the behavior found in these 
systems.    Using  a  more  complex  model  may  create  more 
quantitatively  accurate  models,  but  it  is  likely  that  qualitative 
behavior will remain the same.  
II.  TOY MODEL 
The  Toy  Model  (see  Figure  1)  represents  an  rule  based 
environment as a simple linear 1D domain of points X where 0 
< X < 1. Hard boundaries are placed at X = 0 and X = 1.  A 
normal individual performs their required activities within this 
domain. In the initial configuration the number of rules is N = 0 
and  the  average  latitude  of  a  normal  individual  in  this 
environment is Lnormal(N=0) = 1. As new rules are added, new 
boundaries  are  created  at  random  at  a  new  location  in  the 
domain.    If  there  are  N  rules,  there  will  be  N  internal 
boundaries.  Sorting the boundary locations in increasing order 
results in a boundary at X1, another boundary at X2, such that  
X1 < X2 <   < Xi <   XN 
Taking the difference between  neighboring boundaries results 
in a sequence of N+1 latitudes 
L1   = X1 
L2   = X2 - X1 
  
Li   = Xi - Xi-1 
  
LN   = XN - XN-1 
LN+1  =   1  - XN 
The  sum  of  the  latitudes  is  always   Li  =  1.  So  the  average 
latitude for the normal individual in the environment is always 
Lnormal = 1/(N + 1) 
As more rules are added and more boundaries are created the 
average latitude of the normal individual decreases.

Figure 1.   Toy Model of an environment with a normal individual and 
an insider threat.  The environment has boundaries at coordinates 0 
and 1. Lmin is the minimal latitude required for normal activity.  From 
bottom  to  top:  (a)  no  internal  boundaries  (N=0)  implies  a  single 
latitude L1 = 1; (b) one internal boundary (N=1) implies two latitudes; 
(c)  two  internal  boundaries  (N=2)  implies  three  latitudes,  one  of 
which is less than Lmin; (d) the latitude less than Lmin is eliminated for 
the adversary. 
 2 
Let, Lmin denote the minimum latitude an individual needs 
to perform their required activities.  If any two boundaries are 
less than Lmin apart, then one of the boundaries is likely to be 
crossed.  The normal individual will mostly attempt to remain 
within  these  boundaries  and  so  their  average  latitude  is 
unchanged.    However,  because  the  boundary  needs  to  be 
crossed  often,  it  is  effectively  removed  for  the  insider  threat.  
Boundaries  that  are  likely  to  be  crossed  increase  the  average 
latitude  of  the  insider  threat.    The  number  of  insider  threat 
boundaries Nthreat is equal to the number of latitudes satisfying 
Li > Lmin.  As before, all the threat latitudes must sum to 1 so 
that the average threat latitude is given by 
Lthreat = 1/(Nthreat + 1) 
A simulation of the Toy Model behavior is shown in Figure 
2.  The code for this simulation is provided in the Appendix.  
Figure 2 shows the average latitude versus the number of rules 
for  normal  individuals  and  insider  threats.      As  expected,  the 
insider  threat  latitude  first  decreases  with  the  number  rules, 
reaches a minimum, and then increases as the number of rules 
increases.  The minimum threat latitude occurs at 
Nmin = 1/Lmin 
If N > Nmin, then threat latitude increases.

The  ratio  of  the  threat  latitude  to  the  normal  latitude  is 
shown  in  Figure  3.    For  modest  numbers  of  rules  the  threat 
latitude  is  comparable  to  the  normal  latitudes. 
  As  N 
approaches Nmin the ratio starts to increase.  In  this particular 
instance, the threat latitudes is ~3 times the normal latitude at 
N=Nmin.  The ratio increases dramatically as N surpasses Nmin.

Figure 2 and Figure 3 illustrate four possible regimes that 
are  described  in  Figure  4.    The  regimes  are  under-regulated, 
possibly  optimal,  tipping  point,  and  over-regulated.    In  the 
under-regulated  regime,  the  threat  has  a  large  latitude  that  is 
very similar to that of the normal individual.  At the tipping-
point, the threat latitude is minimized and the normal latitude is 
near the Lmin.  In the over-regulated regime, the threat latitude 
is  increasing  and  the  normal  latitude  is  below  Lmin.      We 
speculate  that  a  possibly  optimal  regime  exists  between  the 
under-regulated regime and the tipping-point.

We  speculate  that  a  possibly  optimal  regime  exists  between  the 
under-regulated regime and the tipping-point. 
III.  PERCOLATION MODEL 
The Toy Model produces behaviors that are consistent with 
intuition:  under-regulation,  tipping-point,  and  over-regulation.  
However,  it  is  not  realistic  to  assume  that  complex  human 
activities can be captured with such a simple model (at least not 
without more evidence).  A more realistic model would likely 
have  additional  dimensions  and  more  complex  interactions 
 3 
The  above  expression  is  minimized  when  Nmin=1/Lmin  and 
results in 
Lexact(Nmin,Lmin) = 1/(Nmin exp[-(Lmin + 1)] + 1) 
which for Lmin << 1 and Nmin >> 1 is  
Lexact(Nmin,Lmin)   e Lmin 
Transforming  the  Toy  Model  into  the  Percolation  Model 
connects it with the extensive theoretical work on percolation.  
One of the primary areas of study in percolation theory is the 
probability  of  clusters  of  occupied  sites  (i.e.,  areas  of  large 
latitude).  The  average  size  of  a  cluster  in  an  infinite  site  1D 
Percolation Model is [Stauffer & Aharony 1991] 
 S(P) = (Pc + P)/(Pc - P) 
where Pc is the percolation threshold.   For an infinite site 1D 
percolation  Pc  =  1.    In  the  Percolation  Model  of  an  insider 
threat the average latitude of a site is 
 Lavg = 1/(N+1) 
Combining  the  formulas  for  Lavg  and  S(P)  gives  the  threat 
latitude in an infinite site 1D Percolation Model

exponential distribution. 
Figure 7 compares the Toy Model value for threat latitude 
with the equivalent value computed using the Percolation.   The 
infinite site 1D Percolation Model is qualitatively equivalent to 
the  Toy  Model  simulations.    Small  differences  between  the 
models are due to finite site simulations versus an infinite site 
model.    Finite  percolation  models  can  also  be  calculated 
analytically, but they are beyond the scope of this work. 
among  dimensions.    Conducting  a  detailed  analysis  of  the 
implications  of  adding  dimensions  and  more  complex 
interactions  would  be 
an  overwhelming  undertaking.  
Fortunately,  the  theoretical  physics  community  has  already 
made this investment.  By changing the terminology of the Toy 
Model and converting it to a Percolation Model, it is possible to 
tap into this prior investment in theoretical work. 
Theoretical  physics  has  extensively  explored  models  of 
complex systems that show behavior similar to the Toy Model.  
These  models  fall  under  a  wide  range  of  names  that  include 
percolation,  critical  phenomena,  phase  transitions,  and  the 
renormalization group.  These models have also been applied 
to  modeling  forest  fires,  oil  fields,  diffusion,  and  a  range  of 
other phenomena [Stauffer & Aharony 1992].

The simplest of these models is 1D percolation.  The Toy 
Model  can  be  transformed  into  the  Percolation  Model  in  two 
steps.  First, the latitudes Li are  rotated  so that they are sitting 
on  sites  (see Figure 5) and when Li < Lmin the site is said to

This  completes  the  transformation.  Part  of  power  of  the 
Percolation Model is that it is effectively defined by only two 
parameters: the dumber of dimensions (in this case 1D) and the 
probability that a site is occupied (in this case P(N,L)). 
This probability also provides a mechanism for computing 
the exact solution of the Toy Model since

and Percolation Model being infinite.  
IV. 
IMPLICATIONS 
The qualitative agreement between the Toy Model and the 
Percolation Model allows the Toy Model to be connected with 
far  more  complex  models.    Percolation  has  been  studied  in 
many  systems  (see  Figure  8)  and  all  exhibit  the  same 
qualitative behavior that is determined by a single parameter P.   
This suggests the qualitative behavior of the 1D insider threat 
model  may  also  be  similar  to  higher  fidelity  insider  threat 
models.  For example, in more complex percolation models the 
percolation  threshold  Pc  gets  smaller  as  the  model  gets  more 
complex (see Figure 8).  This would mean that Nmin becomes 
smaller  in  more  complex  systems  and  that  insider  threat 
latitude starts increasing with a smaller number of rules. 
V.  SUMMARY & FUTURE WORK 
Rules are the primary means of coordinating the activities 
of individuals who have a variety of goals and purposes.  Over-
regulation  and  under-regulation  can  both  be  exploited  by 
insider  threats.    The  Toy  Model  illustrates  this  phenomena 
quantitatively.    Adapting  the  Toy  Model  to  the  Percolation 
Model confirms this phenomena over a wide range models and 
connects  its  with  a  vast  literature  that  has  been  successfully 
applied to many fields. 
 This  work  suggest  that  collecting  specific  pieces  of 
information  about  the  rules  in  an  environment  could  provide 
incite into whether an environment is under-regulated, near the 
tipping-point,  or  over-regulated.    In  particular,  estimating  the 
number of rules, boundary crossings, and Lmin could be use to 
identify  the  regime.    Possible  approaches  to  collecting  this 
information could be:  
   Counting the number of rules [Antoniou et al 1999], 
   Measuring  the  volume  of  materials  used  to  describe  the 
rules, 
   Examining the number of exception requests,   
   Examining the number accidental boundary crossing, and 
   Surveying  the  individuals  in  the  environment  about 
crossings.  
This  work  provides  a 
for 
incorporating  and  understanding  such  data  and  increases  the 
value of collecting such data.
