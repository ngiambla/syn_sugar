The photograph and our understanding of photography is
ever changing and has transitioned from a world of unpro-
cessed rolls of C-41 sitting in a fridge 50 years ago to sharing
photos on the 1.5  screen of a point and shoot camera 10
years back. And today the photograph is again something
di erent. The way we take photos is fundamentally di er-
ent. We can view, share, and interact with photos on the
device they were taken on. We can edit, tag, or   lter  pho-
tos directly on the camera at the same time the photo is
being taken. Photos can be automatically pushed to various
online sharing services, and the distinction between photos
and videos has lessened. Beyond this, and more importantly,
there are now lots of them. To Facebook alone more than 250
billion photos have been uploaded and on average it receives
over 350 million new photos every day [6], while YouTube re-
ports that 300 hours of video are uploaded every minute [22].
A back of the envelope estimation reports 10% of all photos
in the world were taken in the last 12 months, and that was
calculated already more than three years ago [8].
Today, a large number of the digital media objects that
are shared have been uploaded to services like Flickr or In-
stagram, which along with their metadata and their social
ecosystem form a vibrant environment for  nding solutions
to many research questions at scale. Photos and videos pro-
vide a wealth of information about the universe, covering
entertainment, travel, personal records, and various other
aspects of life in general as it was when they were taken.
Considered collectively, they represent knowledge that goes

beyond what is captured in any individual snapshot and
provide information on trends, evidence of phenomena or
events, social context, and societal dynamics. Consequently,
collections of media are useful for qualitative and quantita-
tive empirical research in many domains. However, scienti c
endeavors in  elds like social computing and computer vi-
sion have generally relied on independently collected mul-
timedia datasets, which complicates research growth and
synergy. There is the need for a more substantial dataset
for researchers, engineers, and scientists around the globe.
To meet the call for scale, openness, and diversity in aca-
demic datasets, we take the opportunity in this article to
present a new multimedia dataset containing 100 million
media objects and explain the rationale behind its creation.
We discuss the implications it has for science, research, en-
gineering and development, and demonstrate its usefulness
towards tackling a broad range of problems in various do-
mains. With the release of our dataset comes the opportu-
nity to advance research, giving rise to new challenges and
