Abstract 
Recent  works  in  the  information  science  literature  have  presented  cases  of  using  patent 
databases  and  patent  classification  information  to  construct  network  maps  of  technology 
fields, which aim to aid in competitive intelligence analysis and innovation decision making. 
Constructing  such  a  patent  network  requires  a  proper  measure  of  the  distance  between 
different  classes  of  patents  in  the  patent  classification  systems.  Despite  the  existence  of 
various  distance  measures  in  the  literature,  it  is  unclear  how  to  consistently  assess  and 
compare  them,  and  which  ones  to  select  for  constructing  patent  technology  network  maps. 
This  ambiguity  has  limited  the  development  and  applications  of  such  technology  maps. 
Herein, we propose to compare alternative distance measures and identify the superior ones 
by  analyzing  the  differences  and  similarities  in  the  structural  properties  of  resulting  patent 
network maps. Using United States patent data from 1976 to 2006 and International Patent 
Classification system, we compare 12 representative distance measures, which quantify inter-
field  knowledge  base  proximity,  field-crossing  diversification  likelihood  or  frequency  of 
innovation agents, and co-occurrences of patent classes in the same patents. Our comparative 
analyses suggest the patent technology network maps based on normalized co-reference and 
inventor diversification likelihood measures are the best representatives.

1. Introduction  
    To  pursue  innovation,  inventors,  companies  or  R&D  organizations,  cities  or  countries 
continually diversify to explore technology fields different from their past ones, or combine 
their  existing  knowledge  with  those  of  new  fields  to  build  new  technological  capabilities 
(Schumpeter,  1934;  Dosi,  1982).  Therefore,  innovation  can  be  viewed  as  a  process  of 
searching  and  combining  knowledge  across  different  technology  fields.  The  variety  of 
technology fields together constitutes the  technology space , in which the fields may have 
different distances between each other (Teece et  al., 1994; Breschi et  al., 2003; Kay  et  al., 
2014).  In  turn,  the  heterogeneous  structure  of  the  technology  space  may  condition  the 
diversification  paths  or  knowledge  recombination  prospects  of  innovation  agents  (e.g., 
Thomas  Edison,  Google,  China)  with  different  knowledge  positions  in  the  space,  and 
condition the development potentials of specific technologies (e.g., fuel cells, robots, aircrafts) 
given the positions of their knowledge base in the whole technology space. 
    Recent  studies  have  proposed  to  represent  the  technology  space  as  a  network  map  of 
technology  fields  based  on  mining  patent  data  (Leydesdorff  et  al.,  2014;  Kay  et  al.,  2014; 
Nakamura  et  al.,  2014).  In  such  a  network,  a  vertex  represents  a  technology  field  and  is 
operationalized as  a patent technology  class. The weighted edge between a pair of vertices 
denotes the distance between the vertex-represented technology fields. One can also overlay 
such a network map by highlighting a subset of fields that are associated with a technological 
design  domain  of  interest  (e.g.,  robotics,  fuel  cells),  or  the  innovative  activities  of  an 
innovation agent (Kay et al., 2014). Fig. 1 illustrates an example of the network overlaid with 
a subset of highlighted fields where Google Inc. had been granted US patents over time. Such 
an overlay map locates the fields where a specific agent has developed innovation capabilities 
and also reveals the evolution of such capabilities. 
    Assessment of the relative network positions of the subset of  fields on the overlaid map 
may  illuminate  new  fields  that  are  proximate  to  them  in  the  technology  space  and  present 
great knowledge recombination potential with them (Fleming, 2001; Nakamura et al., 2014). 
Such  analyses  may  also  lead  to  insights  on  the  directions  and  paths  of  technology 
diversification of an innovation agent, e.g., firm, city or country (Breschi et al., 2003; Rigby, 
2013;  Boschma  et  al.,  2014),  or  help  forecast  development  directions  and  potentials  of  an 
emerging  technology,  e.g.,  fuel  cells  or  solar  cells  (Kajikawa  et  al.,  2008;  Ogawa  and 
Kajikawa,  2015;  Benson  and  Magee,  2013;  2015),  given  the  locations  of  its  established 
knowledge base in the technology space. In general, such a map of technology fields will be 
 
3
 
 
useful to aid in technology road mapping of innovation agents or technology-based industries 
and forecasting development directions of emerging technologies.  
 
 
 
Fig.  1.  Example  of  the  technology  network  map  overlaid  with  Google s  knowledge  positions.1 Each  vertex 
represents a 3-digit technology class defined in the International Patent Classification (IPC) system, and its size 
corresponds to the total number of patents in the class from 1976 to 2006. An edge between pairs of vertices is 
measured as inventor cross-field diversification likelihood (see details of the measure in Section 2 and Section 
3.2). The original network is extremely dense. The network visualized here contains the maximum spanning tree 
(i.e., a minimal set of edges that connect all vertices and maximize total edge weights) as the backbone plus the 
strongest  edges,  which  together  make  the  total  number  of  edges  be  twice  of  the  vertices,  as  suggested  by 
Hidalgo  et  al.  (2007)  for best  visualization.  A  vertex  is  highlighted  in  red  color  if  Google  had  patents  in  the 
corresponding technology class in a given time period. Details about this network are in Section 4.1. 
 
 
    For such a network to adequately represent the technology space requires an appropriate 
measure of the distance between different technology fields (Jaffe, 1986; Joo and Kim, 2010; 
Altuntas et al., 2015). Although various distance measures have been proposed from different 
perspectives in the literature (see a review of the measures in Section 2), they have not been 
assessed and compared using consistent criteria or methodology. It is unclear which measures 
are superior for the purpose of constructing technology network maps, and which measures 
are  more  representative  of  the  others.  This  ambiguity  has  limited  the  use  of  technology 
network maps in technology forecasting and roadmap analyses.  
    In this paper, we recognize that the choice of inter-field distance measures determines the 
structure  of  the  technology  network  to  be  constructed,  which  in  turn  influences  the 
innovation-related insights to be drawn from the network analysis. Following this logic, we 
                                                                        
1 Fig. 1 highlights that Google s first patents were in IPC class G06 computing in 2003. Later, Google diversified into 
additional fields. In 2006, it had patents in H03 electronic circuitry, H04 electronic communication and H05 electric 
techniques, and G10 music instruments and acoustics, in addition to G06. These new fields appear to be proximate to the 
original field G06, within the core of the technology network map.

propose a strategy to use the structures of the overall technology networks resulting from the 
choices  of  distance  measures  as  the  lens  or  protocol  to  assess  and  compare  corresponding 
measures.  We  also  demonstrate  this  strategy  through  a  comparative  analysis  of  twelve 
alternative distance measures, by using a few network metrics and patent data from United 
States  Patent  and  Trademark  Office  (USPTO).  These  twelve  measures  are  chosen  as 
representatives  of  the  main  types  of  distance  measures  in  the  literature.  Our  analyses  yield 
new understandings on the differences and similarities of these measures, and also shed light 
on  some  of  these  measures  that  yield  more  representative  network  maps  than  others  for 
constructing technology network maps. 
    The  paper  is  organized  as  follows.  We  first  survey  the  literature  on  various  quantitative 
measures  of  the  distance  of  technology  fields  in  Section  2.  Section  3  introduces  our  data, 
methodology and twelve distance measures. Section 4 reports and discusses results. Section 5 
concludes the paper with suggestions for future work. 
 
2. Literature review: Measures of distance between technology fields 
    In the literature, various technological distance measures have been developed, using the 
information of references, classifications and inventor identities in patent documents. Some 
of these measures were noted as  technological proximity , which is direct reverse concept of 
technological distance (Jaffe, 1986; Leydesdorff et al., 2014). 
2.1 Patent reference-based measures 
    One  strand  of  the  measures  uses  patent  citation  information  to  calculate  indicators  of 
knowledge distance of different technology fields. For instance, to construct the network map 
of  IPC  classes,  Leydesdorff  et  al.  (2014)  used  the  cosine  similarity  index  to  normalize  the 
citing-to-cited relationships between technology classes in an aggregated citation matrix. The 
angular cosine value of the two vectors of citations from two classes to other classes captures 
the similarity of their knowledge bases. Kay et al. (2014) also used the cosine similarity as 
the  measure  of  technological  distance  among  different  patent  categories,  some  of  which 
combine original IPC patent classes to optimize the size distribution of classes for the sake of 
visualization. Indeed, Jaffe (1986) was the first to propose this index for technology mapping, 
whereas  he  used  it  to  measure  the  correlation  between  the  vectors  representing  the 
distributions of firms  patents in a set of technology fields. 
    In  addition,  to  measure  the  knowledge  distance  between  patents,  co-citations,  i.e.,  the 
number  of  shared  forward  citations  of  two  patents,  and  bibliographic  coupling,  i.e.,  the 
number  of  shared  backward  citations  (i.e.  references)  of  two  patents,  were  popularly  used 
 
5
 
 
(Iwan von Wartburg et al., 2005; Leydesdorff and Vaughan, 2006). A co-citation index can 
be  further  normalized  over  the  total  number  of  citations  for  each  article,  i.e.,  the  Jaccard 
index (Small, 1973), or over a probabilistic measure of expected co-citation counts (Zitt et al., 
2000). The formulas of co-citations or bibliographic coupling of patents or academic articles 
can be adopted to measure and indicate the distance of different technology classes.  
2.2 Patent classification-based measures 
    Scholars have also used the  co-classification  information of patents to develop indicators 
of  the  distance  between  technology  classes.  A  patent  belongs  to  at  least  one,  but  usually 
multiple  classes  assigned  by  the  patent  examiners  of  the  issuing  offices.  Using  this 
information, the distance between technology fields can be indicated by the co-occurrence of 
classification  codes  assigned  to  individual  patent  documents  (Engelsman  and  van  Raan, 
1994). The assumption is that the frequency in which two classes are jointly assigned to the 
same patents will be high if these two classes are proximate. This assumption is similar to the 
survivor  principle  in  economics  (Stigler,  1968),  which  suggests  that  surviving  firms  
behaviors  are  more  observable  in  empirical  data,  because  they  are  more  efficient  and  thus 
make firms survive and observable.  
    Jaffe (1986) was also the first to apply the cosine index to measuring the distance of firms  
technological portfolios based on the symmetrical matrix of the frequency of two technology 
classes being jointly assigned to the same patent that belongs to the observed firms. Later, the 
cosine  index  was  adopted  for  the  general  symmetrical  co-occurrence  matrix  in  which  each 
cell  represents  the  total  number  of  patents  that  are  assigned  with  both  technology  fields 
represented by the respective row and column (Breschi et al., 2003; Ejermo, 2005; Kogler et 
al.,  2013).  Leydesdorff  and  Vaughan  (2006)  argued  that  the  symmetrical  co-occurrence 
matrix contains similarity data and can be analyzed directly, whereas further normalization of 
the  co-occurrence  matrix  using  the  Pearson  correlation  or  cosine  may  distort  the  data  and 
generate spurious correlations. 
    Leydesdorff (2008) further proposed to analyze the asymmetrical classification assignment 
matrix,  with  patents  as  the  units  of  analysis  and  the  technology  classes  as  the  column 
variables,  and  use  the  cosine  index  to  associate  the  column  variables.  He  also  found  that 
networks built using classification data match poorly with those generated by citation data, 
and the classification data might be less useful than co-citation data for technology network 
mapping,  primarily  because  the  classifications  were  assigned  poorly  by  the  ISI  staff.  In 
addition,  Joo  and  Kim  (2010)  also  argued  that  co-classification  measures  may  not  directly 
assess  the  distance  of  technology  fields  and  proposed  to  create  a  multi-dimensional 
 
6
 
 
contingency  table  to  represent  patent  classification  data  and  apply  the  Mantel-Haenszel 
common odds ratio on the table for measurement. 
    Furthermore,  Nesta  and  Dibiaggio  (2005),  using  the  typical  co-occurrence  matrix, 
measured the deviation of the number of observed patents shared between classes from the 
expected  number  of  randomly  shared  patents,  in  order  to  reveal  the  distance  among  fields, 
following Teece et al. (1994) who initially developed this normalization method to measure 
the distance between industrial fields. This measure takes a t-statistic form and adjusts for the 
effects of class sizes. Similarly, recognizing the uneven importance of different patents and 
their classes, Altuntas et al. (2015) used the data of forward citations of each patent and of the 
size of each technology class in terms of total patent count to weight each patent occurring 
between a pair of technology classes, when counting the occurrences of the same patents in a 
pair of classes. 
2.3 Likelihood of diversification as measures of distance 
Another group of measures utilizes the data on field-crossing diversification behaviors of 
innovation agents (e.g., countries, regions, cities, organizations or inventors) to indicate the 
proximity (the reverse of distance) between technology fields. In studying the product space, 
Hidalgo et al. (2007) measured the proximity between two product categories in terms of the 
likelihood for an average country to develop strong relative comparative advantage (RCA) in 
one product category, given that it has developed strong RCA in the other. The assumption is 
that this likelihood is high if the capabilities required to produce products in one category are 
similar  to  those  required  to  produce  another  product.  In  other  words,  the  likelihood  of  the 
diversification of countries across two product categories may indicate the proximity of the 
knowledge  base  of  these  two  product  categories.  Boschma  et  al.  (2013)  applied  the  same 
proximity  measure  to  studying  the  diversification  of  productive  capabilities  of  different 
regions in Spain based on export product categories.  
Although  the  studies  of  product  space  were  based  on  export  and  import  data  and  the 
custom classifications of products, their proximity measure can be adapted to patent data and 
patent  technology  classifications.  For  instance,  a  mathematically  similar  index  called  the 
revealed  technological  advantage  (RTA)  has  been  used  to  measure  the  pattern  of 
technological  specialization  of  innovation  agents  (Cantwell  and  Vertova,  2004;  Hall  et  al., 
2001). Boschma et al. (2014) applied this measure to calculating the likelihood of technology 
diversification at the region and city levels, and used such a likelihood as edge weight in the 
network of patent technology classes.

In parallel, Teece et al. (1994) estimated how much the frequencies that firms diversify in 
combinations of 4-digit SIC industries deviate from what one would expect if diversification 
patterns  were  random.  They  called  it  a   survivor-based  measure ,  because  their  inspiration 
was  from  the  survivor  principle  in  economics  (Stigler,  1968),  which  suggests  that  efficient 
firms survive and contribute to empirical observations and regularity. Following the survivor 
principle,  Teece  et  al.  argued  that  one  can  observe  that  firms  diversify  more  often  across 
industries  that  are  more  proximate,  so  that  the  number  of  diversifying  firms  in  a  pair  of 
industries may indicate the distance of the industries. Particularly, this measure is superior in 
that it extracts the information about the true distance in the number of empirical observations 
by comparing it to the expected value under the hypothesis that diversification is random and 
not affected by the true distance. In doing so, it adjusts for industry size such that it can be 
compared  consistently  across  industry  pairs.  Despite  being  initially  developed  to  measure 
industry distance, this measure can be easily leveraged to measure the distance of technology 
fields, based on patent data. 
2.4 Other measures 
In  addition  to  the  information  on  references,  classifications,  and  inventor  identities  in 
patent documents, patent texts have also been analyzed to measure the distance of different 
technologies  and  fields.  For  instance,  Nakamura  et  al.  (2014)  measured  the  technological 
distance of patents in the sub-domains of automobile and aircraft industries by using cosine 
similarity of the vectors representing occurrence frequencies of words in the patent titles and 
abstracts of pairs of sub-domains. Fu et al. (2013) proposed a technological distance measure 
as the text similarity between patents in terms of the functional meanings of the verbs that 
appear  in  the  description  texts  of  patents.  Information  of   functional  similarity   is  useful, 
because  those  different  solutions  or  mechanisms  used  in  different  inventions  to  address 
similar functions present great potential to be recombined into new technologies. 
 
Despite the variety of distance measures in the literature, they have not been assessed and 
compared  using  a  consistent  methodology  or  criterion.  To  address  this  gap,  this  paper 
presents  a  strategy  and  methodology  to  assess  and  compare  alternative  measures  by 
investigating  the  similarities  and  differences  in  the  structures  of  their  resulting  technology 
networks. To implement this strategy, we analyze twelve distance measures that belong to the 
categories of measures reviewed in Section 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3, respectively.

3. Data and methodology  
3.1 Data 
    The vertices in our technology network maps are patent classes defined in the International 
Patent Classification (IPC) system, following many other authors who have considered IPC 
classes the most suitable and stable representations of technology fields (Leydesdorff et al., 
2014).2 The IPC system includes 8 broad technical domains, which can be subdivided into, 
for  example,  3-digit  and  4-digit  level  subclasses.  For  the  best  visualization  without  losing 
necessary  details  and  resolution  of  the  technology  landscape,  we  chose  3-digit  classes  to 
represent vertices in networks. Some undefined classes, for example,  A99 - subject matter 
not otherwise provided for in this section,  are excluded from the analysis. As a result, the 
networks  contain  121  vertices,  i.e.  3-digit  level  IPC  classes.  We  use  the  patent  data  from 
1976  to  2006  from  United  States  Patent  &  Trademark  Office  (USPTO)  and  NBER  Patent 
Data Project3. The data set contains 3,186,310 utility patents. Each patent is classified in one 
or multiple IPC classes. 
3.2 Distance measures 
The literature review has shed light on at least four categories of distance measures: 
1)  the proximity (either similarity or relatedness) of knowledge bases of the innovation 
activities in a pair of technology fields, using patent citation data; 
2)  the likelihood for the same innovation agents (i.e., inventors, R&D organizations, or 
countries)  to  invent  technologies  in  a  pair  of  technology  fields,  using  data  on  the 
successful patenting records of the agents (i.e., in which classes one has patents); 
3)  the frequency to observe the same innovation agents inventing technologies in a pair 
of technology fields, using data on the successful patenting records of the agents;  
4)  the  frequency  to  observe  a  pair  of  technology  fields  being  assigned  to  the  same 
patents, using data on the co-classifications of patents. 
In this paper, we choose to analyze 3 specific measures that are most representative for 
each above category, totaling 12 measures. Table 1 summarizes these 12 measures that follow 
respective rationales.  
 
 
                                                                        
2 This paper focuses on comparing vertex distance measures, so vertex definitions are fixed. Future research may conduct 
similar analyses based on different definitions of vertices, such as United States Patent Classes and recently proposed hybrid 
patent categories (Kay et al. 2014; Bensen and Magee, 2013; 2015).

The first group of measures (A1, A2 and A3) uses the information of backward citations 
(i.e. references) of patents, which represent the knowledge inputs to innovation activities, to 
measure either relatedness or similarity of knowledge bases or inputs of different classes. 
A1.   Normalized  co-reference :  the  count  of  shared  references,  normalized  by  the  total 
count of all unique references of patents in a pair of classes, formulated as

where  Ci  and  Cj  are  the  numbers  of  backward  citations  (i.e.,  references)  of  patents  in 
technology  classes  i  and  j; 
C C 
i
j
 is  the  number  of  patents  referenced  in  both  technology 
classes  i  and  j,  and 
C C 
i
j
 is  the  total  number  of  unique  patents  referenced  in  both 
technology classes i and j, respectively. It is also known as the Jaccard index (Jaccard, 1901). 
A2.   Class-to-class  cosine  similarity :  the  cosine  of  the  angle  of  the  two  vectors 
representing  two  technology  classes   distributions  of  citations  into  all  patent  classes 
(Leydesdorff, 2007), formulated as

where Cij denotes the number of citations referred from patents in technology class i to the 
patents  in  technology  class  j;  k  belongs  to  all  the  technology  classes.  The  cosine  value  is 
between [0,1] and indicates the similarity of the knowledge bases of two fields.  
A3.   Class-to-patent  cosine  similarity :  the  cosine  of  the  angle  of  the  two  vectors 
representing  two  technology  classes   distributions  of  citations  into  specific  unique  patents 
instead  of  aggregated  classes.  The  same  formula  as  (2)  applies,  but  Cij  now  denotes  the 
number of citations of all patents in class i to the specific patent j. Measure A3 has a better 
resolution than measure A2, whereas computation is slightly more complex.  
 
The  next  two  groups  of  measures,  B1-B3  and  C1-C3,  similarly  utilize  the  patent 
information related to successful inventive behaviors of different types of agents (inventors, 
organizations  and  countries)  in  terms  of  which  classes  their  patents  are  assigned  in.  These 
measures  generally  indicate  the  likelihood  or  frequency  that  innovation  agents  diversify 
across  a  pair  of  technology  fields.  We  separate  them  into  two  groups,  B  and  C,  due  to  the 
difference in their mathematical formulas.  
B1.   Inventor  diversification

	is the total number of patents in

total  patents  than  an   average   inventor;  otherwise,  if  RTAc,i   1 .  The  mathematical 
formulation  is  adopted  from  Hidalgo  et  al.  (2007).  A  high  Rij  value  indicates  a  higher 
likelihood  for  an  inventor  to  leverage  knowledge  across  technology  fields  i  and  j  for 
innovation, or to diversify personal inventive activities across fields i and j. To calculate this 
measure,  we  use  the  unique  inventor  identifiers  from  the  Institute  for  Quantitative  Social 
Science at Harvard University (Li et al., 2014). 
B2.   Organization  diversification  likelihood :  the  formula  is  the  same  as  the   inventor 
diversification  likelihood   above  (Eq.  3  and  Eq.  4),  except  that  the  agent  is  now  an 
 organization ,  which  is  often  a  company,  university,  or  public  R&D  institute.  The 
organizations  are  identified  using  the   unique  assignee   identifiers  created  by  the  National 
Bureau of Economics Research (NBER) (Hall et al., 2001). 
B3.   Country  diversification  likelihood :  the  formula  is  the  same  as  the   inventor 
diversification likelihood  above (Eq. 3 and Eq. 4), except that the agent is now a country. 
 
Measures C1, C2 and C3 employ the form of a  measure,  which Teece et al. (1994)  first 
proposed to indicate the relatedness between industries, following the  survivor principle  in 
economics.  Applied  to  the  context  of  technology  classes,  the  measure  compares  the 
empirically  observed  frequency  of  co-occurrences  of  a  pair  of  technology  classes  in  the 
patenting records of the same inventors, organizations or countries, to the expected frequency 
in a random co-occurrence situation controlled for the sizes of technology classes. 
C1:  Inventor co-occurrence frequency : the deviation of the empirically observed number 
of inventors occurring in a pair of technology classes from the value that would be expected 
when technology classes are randomly assigned to inventors. The formula is,  
 
m
ij
  
=
r
ij
O
ij
s
ij
(5) 
where Oij is the observed number of inventors active in both technology classes i and j, i.e. 
the count of inventor-level occurrences of patent technology classes i and j;   ij and  ij are the 
 
12 
 
 
mean and variance of the expected number of inventors active in both classes i and j, given 
by a hypergeometric distribution. The hypoergeometric distribution defines   ij and  ij as 
 
 
m =

s
2
=
m
(
ij
T N
T

)(
T N

T

)
  
(6) 
(7) 
where T is the total number of inventors having two or more technology classes; Ni and Nj are 
the number of inventors empirically observed in technology i and j, respectively. Thus rij is 
analogous  to  a  t-statistic.  It  indicates  that,  when  the  actual  number  Oij  observed  between 
classes  i  and  j  greatly  exceeds  the  expected  number    ij,  these  two  technology  fields  are 
considered highly proximate. 
    This  measure  controls  for  the  effect  of  the  sizes  of  technology  classes  on  inventor 
appearances in them. If technology classes have many inventors, i.e. Ni (or Nj) is large, the 
chance for inventors in Ni (or Nj) to be active in class j would be high, even if classes i and j 
are distant. When Ni or Nj is small, one would not expect to see many co-occurrences even if 
classes i and j are highly proximate.   ij estimates the co-occurrence frequency resulting only 
from the size effect but not from the effect of knowledge distance. Therefore, rij extracts the 
information in Oij about actual distance. 
C2.   Organization  co-occurrence  frequency :  the  formula  is  the  same  as   inventor  co-
occurrence frequency  above (Eq. 5-7), except that the agent is now an  organization , which 
is often a company, university, or public R&D agency.  
C3.   Country  co-occurrence  frequency : 
the  formula 
is 
the  same  as   inventor 
diversification likelihood  above (Eq. 5-7), except that the agent is now a country. 
 
The last group of measures (D1, D2 and D3) uses the information of the co-classifications 
of patents to quantify the co-occurrences of a pair of technology classes in the same patents. 
Co-classification  means  that  a  patent  is  assigned  to  more  than  one  class.  Patent  examiners 
based on their assessments of the inventions carry out the assignment activity. 
D1.   Normalized  co-classification :  the  count  of  shared  patents,  normalized  by  the  total 
count of unique patents in a pair of classes, formulated as 
 
Co-Classification

N

where Oij is the number of shared patents in both technology classes i and j. 
D3:  Patent co-occurrence frequency : the deviation of the empirically observed number of 
patents occurring in a pair of technology classes from the value that would be expected when 
technology classes are randomly assigned to patents. Its formulas are the same as those for 
inventor,  organization  and  country  co-occurrence  frequencies,  i.e.  Eq.  (5)-(7).  But  here  the 
variables are given new meanings: Oij is the number of shared patents in both classes i and j; 
T  is  the  total  number  of  patents  having  two  or  more  technology  classes;  Ni  and  Nj  are  the 
number of patents in classes i and j, respectively. D3 concerns the frequency of patents being 
assigned  to  a  pair  of  classes,  differing  from  C1,  C2  and  C3  that  concern  the  frequency  of 
innovation agents being active in a pair of classes. 
 
By far we have introduced 12 measures to be analyzed in Section 4. While some measures 
(such  as  A2,  B3,  D2  and  D3)  have  appeared  in  prior  studies  of  technology  networks,  the 
others (such as A1, A3, B1, B2, C1, C2, C3 and D1) are new. A1 and D1 use the formula of 
well-established  Jaccard  index,  but  are  new  to  the  literature  on  patent  network  mapping. 
While  A3  employs  the  cosine  formula  of  A2  that  has  been  used  to  construct  patent 
technology networks (Leydesdorff et al., 2014; Kay et al., 2014), it is new in that it considers 
the  distribution  of  citations  to  unique  patents,  rather  than  classes,  in  order  to  improve 
measurement resolution. The formula for B1, B2 and B3 first appeared in the studies on the 
diversification  of  countries  or  regions  in  the  product  space  based  on  export  product  data 
(Hidalgo et al., 2007; Boschma et al., 2014). To our best knowledge, the present paper is the 
first to apply this formula to the analysis levels of inventors and inventive organizations in the 
context  of  technology  and  patent  classes.  Thus  we  consider  B1  (inventor  diversification 
likelihood)  and  B2  (organization  diversification  likelihood)  are  new  to  the  literature. 
Likewise, the formula of C1, C2 and C3 was first developed to measure industry relatedness 
(Teece et al., 1994). Here, it is the first time that the formula is used to measure the frequency 
of innovation agents having patents in pairs of patent technology classes.

3.3 Strategy of comparison 
Because these distance measures deal with the same underline structure of the technology 
space, the overall network map structures resulting from them are expected to be similar. The 
maps  that  exhibit  the  highest  structural  similarities  with  all  other  maps  are  the  best 
representatives  out  of  this  set  of  alternative  maps  to  represent  the  underlining  technology 
space.  Therefore,  after  the  networks  of  the  121  IPC  classes  are  constructed  by  using  the 
twelve  distance  measures,  we  investigate  their  pairwise  correlations/similarities  in  terms  of 
network structural properties, for example, weights of corresponding edges and centralities of 
corresponding vertices in different networks. 
To  calculate  the  centrality  of  each  vertex,  we  employ  the  two  most  commonly  used 
network  centrality  metrics  in  graph  theory,  because  of  their  applicability  to  weighted 
undirected networks. One is degree centrality, which is the sum of the weights of the edges 
connected to the focal vertex. The other is eigenvector centrality, which is the value of the 
focal vertex s respective element in the dominant eigenvector of the adjacency matrix of the 
network (Newman, 2005). We also assess the correlation between vertex centralities and the 
indicators of  importance  of technology classes (e.g., total numbers of patents and forward 
citation counts of patents in a class), in the 12 technology networks. 
 
4. Results 
    Before comparing different types of networks, we first examine the over-time changes of 
each  of  them.  Table  2  reports  the  Pearson  coefficients  of  correlations  of  the  weights  of 
corresponding  edges  in  different  time  periods  for  each  network.  It  is  shown  that  the 
correlations  between  networks  of  the  same  type  but  in  different  time  periods  are  generally 
high  (in  most  cases,  higher  than  0.9),  indicating  that  network  changes  over  time  are  fairly 
slow regardless of the choices of distance measures. Such observations are consistent with the 
prior  study  of  Hinze  et  al.  (1997)  that  also  suggested  the  stability  of  the  network  of 
technology fields. 
    In the meantime, these two networks based on measures of the likelihood and frequency of 
country-level  cross-field  diversification  (B3  and  C3)  are  the  least  stable  over  time,  as 
indicated by their lowest correlation coefficients in the range of 0.5~0.6. For all measures, the 
network based on data for the longest time period (1976 to 2006) is the most correlated with 
all other networks constructed using data for single decades (e.g. 1977 to 1986, 1987 to 1996, 
1997 to 2006). Therefore, in later analyses we focus on the networks constructed using our 
 
15 
 
 
total patent data from 1976 to 2006, to have the most representative empirical approximation 
of the distance between technology fields.

    To  develop  a  general  intuition  about  technology  network  structures,  we  visualize  these 
twelve  networks,  using  VOSviewer  that  was  initially  created  to  visualize  bibliometric 
networks. Leydesdorff et al. (2014) showed that it also provides good visualizations of patent 
technology  networks.  As an example, Fig. 2 visualizes the technology network constructed 
by  using  the  measure  of  inventor  diversification  likelihood  (B1).  This  network  is  also  the 
background map used in Fig. 1 to locate the specific knowledge positions of Google and to 
reveal its innovation directions or diversification paths by overlaying. 
    These  networks  are  almost  fully  connected,  but  most  of  the  edges  have  extremely  small 
values,  indicating  long  distance  between  most  fields.  Therefore,  to  visually  reveal  its  main 
structure, we filter the network to contain only the maximum spanning tree4 as the skeleton 
plus the strongest edges, which together make the total number of edges be twice that of the 
vertices. Hildago et al. (2007) suggested this threshold of edge filtering as a rule of thumb for 
good  network  visualization.  Fig.  2  is  such  a  filtered  network.  It  exhibits  a  heterogeneous 
structure,  with  six  communities  of  technology  fields  identified  by  the  Louvain  community 
detection  method  (Blondel  et  al.,  2008).  The  heterogeneity,  instead  of  homogeneity,  of  the 
structure of technology networks justifies it as a good lens or protocol for the comparison of 
alterative networks. 
 
Fig.  2 The technology network using the inventor diversification likelihood as distance measure. Vertex sizes 
correspond to the total patent counts in respective IPC patent classes; vertex colors denote different communities. 
 
                                                                        
4 A maximum spanning tree (MST) only keeps those strongest edges that minimally connect the network into a 
tree. The MST for the network in Fig. 2 contains the strongest 120 edges that connect all 121 vertices into a tree.

4.1 Correlation of edge weights between different networks 
    To compare the structures of the 12 networks, we first investigate the Pearson correlation 
coefficient between the edge weights of corresponding pairs of technology classes in different 
networks (see Table 3). In Table 3, we underline the highest correlation coefficient between 
each  measure  and  any  other  measures,  and  also  report  the  average  of  the  correlation 
coefficients of one measure with all other 11 measures. In respective categories (A, B, C and 
D), 
the  networks  using 
the  measures  of  normalized  co-reference  (A1), 
inventor 
diversification  likelihood (B1), inventor  co-occurrence  frequency (C1) and co-classification 
(D1) are the most correlated with all other types of networks. This result suggests, A1, B1, 
C1 and D1 lead to the most representative networks in their respective groups.

*  Distance  measures:  (A1)  normalized  co-reference;  (A2)  class-to-class  cosine  similarity;  (A3)  class-to-patent  cosine 
similarity; (B1) inventor diversification likelihood; (B2) organization diversification likelihood; (B3) country diversification

    In particular,  among  all the pairwise correlations, the correlation coefficient (=0.915) for 
the pair of A1 and B1 is the highest. This may suggest a strong effect of the technological 
distance  of  a  pair  of  fields  on  the  likelihood  for  inventors  to  diversify  across  fields  or  to 
combine knowledge of these fields to generate new inventions. In the meantime, this effect of 
knowledge  distance  on  diversification  patterns  is  lesser  for  organizations  and  the  least  for 
countries.  The  networks  based  on  country  diversification  likelihood  (B3)  and  country  co-
occurrence  frequency  (C3)  are  the  least  correlated  with  networks  in  group  A  based  on 
knowledge  distance  measures  as  well  as  all  other  networks.  That  is,  the  survivor  principle 
may  not  explain  technology  diversification  patterns  of  countries.  A  country  may  survive 
many inefficient diversification choices and behaviors across distant fields, as long as their 
resources are abundant enough to ensure survival. In contrast, individual inventors must learn 
and  master  relevant  knowledge  of  a  technology  field  in  order  to  invent  there.  Thus  the 
 
18 
 
 
diversification patterns of inventors, as measured by B1 and C1, are strongly constrained by 
the knowledge distance of different fields, as measured by A1. 
We  further  plot  and  visually  compare  the  distributions  of  edges  by  weights  of  the  12 
network maps in Fig. 3. The networks using group A measures and the networks using B1 
and B2 as well as D1 measures exhibit negative exponential distributions. In particular, the 
high skewness of the A1, A2 and A3 networks indicates that very most technology fields are 
indeed highly distant from one another. Thus, the likelihood for inventors to diversify across 
most pairs of technology fields must be also limited. This is reflected in the similarly skewed 
distribution of edges in the network using inventor diversification likelihood (B1).

    In  group  B,  as  we  expand  the  scope  of  the  innovation  agents  from  inventors  (B1)  to 
organizations  (B2)  and  then  to  countries  (B3),  the  mean  values  of  inter-field  distance 
decreases  (i.e.  proximity  increases)  and  the  skewness  of  the  distribution  decreases.  This 
increasing normality from B1 to B3 may also suggest that countries may make more normal 
decisions  of  cross-field  diversifications,  without  being  strongly  constrained  by  inter-field 
knowledge distance whose distributions are highly  skewed.  In addition, the distributions of 
C1, C2, C3 and D3 all exhibit the form of normal distributions, despite varied skewness. This 
similarity  may  result  from  their  shared  mathematical  formation  that  normalizes  empirical 
observations with corresponding random scenarios. 
4.2 Correlation of vertex centralities between different networks 
We also investigate the correlation between degree and eigenvector centralities of the same 
set of 121 vertices in different networks.  In Tables 4(a)  and 4(b),  we underline the highest 
correlation  coefficients  between  each  measure  and  any  other  measures,  and  also  report  the 
average of the correlation coefficients of each measure with all other 11 measures. For both 
types of centrality metrics, within group A, the networks using normalized co-reference (A1) 
and class-to-patent cosine similarity (A3) are far more correlated with all other networks than 
class-to-class  cosine  similarity  (A2),  although  A2  is  popularly  used  in  the  literature 
(Leydesdorff et al., 2014; Kay et al., 2014).

Within  group  B,  the  networks  using  inventor  diversification  likelihood  (B1)  and 
organization diversification likelihood (B2) are far more correlated with other networks, than 
country  diversification  likelihood  (B1).  In  group  C,  the  network  using  organization  co-
occurrence frequency (C2) is the most correlated with other types of networks, in contrast to 
the  analysis  of  edge  weight  correlations  (see  Table  3)  that  suggests  the  network  using 
inventor co-occurrence frequency (C1) is the most correlated one from group C. The results 
of group D networks are mixed across the analyses of degree and eigenvector centralities, and 
the correlations of group D networks with other networks are generally weak. 
    In the meantime, we find a few negative correlation coefficients in Table 4. The negative 
correlations  between  group  A  networks  (based  on  knowledge  distance)  and  country 
diversification likelihood (B3) and country co-occurrence frequency (C3) may suggest that, it 
is more often for countries to diversify into or combine knowledge of less central fields in the 
technology space, implying broad exploration.  
    In brief, based on the analysis of pairwise network vertex centrality correlations, A1 and 
A3, B1, B2, and C2 lead to the most representative network maps. 
 
4.3 Correlations of vertex centrality, popularity and impact in different networks 
    The  relative  network  positions  of  technology  fields  in  the  total  technology  space  may 
affect  their  relative  popularity  (i.e.  attracting  innovation  activities)  and  impact  (i.e. 
influencing  future  innovation  activities).  For  instance,  for  the  technology  classes  that  are 
strongly  connected  to  many  other  classes  (i.e.  high  centrality  in  the  technology  network), 
innovation agents from many other fields may enjoy the ease to diversify into them, resulting 
in  a  large  number  of  patents.  Innovation  agents  in  highly  central  fields  can  also  see  many 
innovation opportunities via leveraging and recombining knowledge from many other fields 
strongly connected to their own. Thus, the relative network positions of technology classes in 
terms  of  centralities  may  predict  their  relative  importance.  Herein,  we  compare  such 
predictabilities of the 12 networks. 
We focus on two indicators of the importance of a technology field: popularity and impact. 
Popularity of a technology field is measured by the total number of all patents in its patent 
class  from  1976  to  2006.  Impact  of  a  field  is  measured  by  the  number  of  total  forward 
citations  of  all  patents  in  the  field,  i.e.  the  number  of  later  patents  that  cite  a  focal  patent. 
 
21 
 
 
Forward citation count of a patent has been found to be an effective indicator of the economic 
impact  of  the  patent  in  a  number  of  prior  studies  (Albert  et  al.,  1991;  Hall  et  al.,  2005; 
Harhoff  et  al.,  1999;  Lee  et  al.,  2007;  Trajtenberg,  1990).  We  calculate  Spearman  rank 
correlations  between  vertex  centralities  and  popularity/impact  indicators  of  the  121 
technology classes in each of the 12 networks, because it is more appropriate for the purpose 
of investigating if more central vertices are also more important ones. Results are shown in 
Table 5.

Among  all  12  networks,  the  one  using  normalized  co-reference  (A1)  yields  the  highest 
correlations of vertices between their network centralities and total patent counts as well as 
forward  citation  counts.  A1  is  followed  by  the  networks  using  inventor  diversification 
likelihood (B1), normalized co-classification (D1) and class-to-patent cosine similarity (A3), 
in terms of the predictability of vertex centralities on actual importance. In these networks, it 
is highly likely that more central technology classes are also more popular and impactful ones. 
None  of  other  networks  than  A1,  B1,  D1  and  A3  provides  a  correlation  coefficient  greater 
than 0.5. 
4.4 Brief summary of findings 
    We have analyzed different kinds of correlations in terms of edge weights, vertex centrality 
and  importance,  among  the  12  technology  networks,  in  order  to  explore  how  similar  each 
network  is  with  other  networks.  We  paid  special  attention  to  the  networks  that  have  the 
highest overall correlations with all other networks. Specifically, the measures of normalized 
co-reference (A1) and inventor diversification likelihood (B1) lead to network maps that are 
consistently the most correlated with other networks, in terms of edge and vertex properties 
of  the  networks,  and  also  provide  the  best  correlations  between  network  centrality  and 
 
22 
 
 
importance indicators of technology  classes. These networks are the best representatives of 
the technology space from this set of 12 candidate alternatives compared in this study.  
    A  few  findings  on  additional  measures  are  noteworthy.  First,  in  group  A,  class-to-class 
cosine  similarity  (A2)  performs  the  worst  in  various  correlation  analyses,  although  it  is 
popularly used for constructing network maps of patent technology classes in the literature. 
Class-to-patent  cosine  similarity  (A3)  follows  the  same  formula  of  A2  but  uses  a  higher 
resolution of data, and is highly correlated with A1. In some cases of our analysis, A3 is no 
worse  than  A1.  Second,  the  networks  using  country  diversification  likelihood  (B3)  and 
country  co-occurrence  frequency  (C3)  are  the  least  correlated  with  the  networks  using 
measures in group A. Furthermore, inventor co-occurrence frequency (C1), organization co-
occurrence  frequency  (C2)  and  normalized  co-classification  (D1)  perform  well  in  some  of 
our correlation analyses, but not always. 
 
5. Conclusion 
This paper contributes to the research to develop and analyze patent technology network 
maps  to  explore  technology  diversification  and  knowledge  combination  opportunities,  and 
thus  support  technology  forecasting  and  road  mapping  practices.  A  main  challenge  to 
developing reasonable technology network maps is the ambiguity in the choice of measures 
of the distance between various technology fields in the total technology space. To address 
this  challenge,  we  have  proposed  a  strategy  to  assess  and  compare  alternative  measures 
through analyzing the overall structures of their resulting networks, because the structures of 
technology networks condition the strategic insights that can be potentially drawn for road-
mapping and forecasting analyses but are affected by the choices of distance measures. 
We  implemented  the  strategy  in  a  comparative  analysis  of  twelve  distance  measures,  by 
correlating  the  edge  and  vertex  properties  of  their  resulting  networks  based  on  network 
structural  properties.  These  twelve  measures  were  chosen  to  represent  the  most  common 
types of distance measures that have been proposed in the literature. These measures had not 
been  previously  compared  via  a  consistent  quantitative  methodology.  Particularly,  our 
analyses  in  all  cases  consistently  suggest  the  measures  of  normalized  co-reference  and 
inventor diversification likelihood lead to network maps that are the most similar to all other 
maps. That is, these two measures lead to relatively the most representative technology maps 
in our comparative set of twelve. 
The  contribution  of  the  present  paper  lies  primarily  in  promising  and  demonstrating  the 
strategy to assess alternative distance measures by analyzing the correlations or similarity of 
 
23 
 
 
the overall network structures resulting from those measures. For a consistent comparison of 
alternative distance measures, we utilized IPC 3-digit classes to represent technological fields 
and  operationalize  the  vertices  in  the  networks.  Moving  forward,  the  same  network-based 
comparative strategy and analysis that we have demonstrated here can be also be carried out 
on alternative definitions of vertices (representing technology  fields) and categorizations of 
patents,  such  as  USPC  (United  States  Patent  Classification),  CPC  (Cooperative  Patent 
Classification), and the hybrid patent categories  proposed by Kay  et al. (2014) and Benson 
and  Magee  (2013;  2015)5,  to  see  which  distance  measures  lead  to  the  most  representative 
maps. We consider this a promising avenue for future research.  
Also,  we  only  compared  twelve  distance  measures.  Although  they  are  representative, 
additional  measures  exist  in  the  literature.  Researchers  may  also  propose  new  types  of 
measures in future. Therefore, future work may  compare a broader set of existing and new 
measures.  In  addition,  the  present  analyses  only  made  use  of  a  few  simple  graph  theory 
metrics  to  analyze  the  correlations  of  the  networks  in  terms  of  their  structures,  for 
demonstrating our proposed distance measure comparison strategy based on network analysis. 
More  sophisticated  network  analysis  methods  can  be  applied  to  this  kind  of  analysis.  For 
instance,  one  can  investigate  and  compare  the  community  structure  of  alternative  patent 
technology  networks,  using  community  detection  algorithms.  Eventually,  we  aim  to 
investigate  how  to  effectively  use  the  technology  network  maps  to  explore  knowledge 
combination  opportunities  for  innovation  and  technology  diversification  directions  of 
individual inventors, technology companies, cities and countries.
