Professional team sports provide an excellent domain for studying the dynamics of social com-
petitions. These games are constructed with simple, well-de ned rules and payo s that admit a
high-dimensional set of possible actions and nontrivial scoring dynamics. The resulting gameplay
and e orts to predict its evolution are the object of great interest to both sports professionals and en-
thusiasts. In this paper, we consider two online prediction problems for team sports: given a partially
observed game Who will score next? and ultimately Who will win? We present novel interpretable
generative models of within-game scoring that allow for dependence on lead size (restoration) and
on the last team to score (anti-persistence). We then apply these models to comprehensive within-
game scoring data for four sports leagues over a ten year period. By assessing these models  relative
goodness-of- t we shed new light on the underlying mechanisms driving the observed scoring dynam-
ics of each sport. Furthermore, in both predictive tasks, the performance of our models consistently
outperforms baselines models, and our models make quantitative assessments of the latent team
skill, over time.

INTRODUCTION
Competition in social systems is a natural and perva-
sive mechanism for improving performance and distribut-
ing limited resources. The quantitative study of such
competitions can improve our ability to predict the out-
comes associated with speci c strategies and the strategic
choices that competitors may make. However, most real
competitions take place in complex and evolving environ-
ments [15, 26], which makes them di cult to study. Pro-
fessional team sports, with their well de ned and consis-
tently enforced rules, provide a controlled setting for the
study of competition dynamics [14, 27, 29] and have pre-
viously been used as model systems for studying business
decision making and human behavioral biases [28, 34].
The recent trend toward recording comprehensive and
detailed data on the events within particular games pro-
vides us with new opportunities to study, model, and
predict the dynamics of these games. The results of these
studies promise to shed new light on a wide variety of ex-
isting competitive social systems, and enhance work on
designing new ones, both o ine and online.
Here, we examine the time series of scoring events in
all league games across four di erent team sports over a
period of ten years. We construct and test probabilistic
models for two online predictive tasks: given a partially
observed game Who will score next? and ultimately Who
will win? We then use these models to investigate the
predictiveness of the dynamical phenomena of restoration
and anti-persistence, which are de ned below.
The events within a particular game can be e ectively
modeled as the interaction of skill and chance. Inferring
skill from a series of competitions has a long history of

study, both for individuals [11, 17] and for teams [20, 35].
However, this past work has typically only considered the
 nal outcome of games, in terms of either a win or loss,
or the  nal point di erence. Here, we focus on modeling
the speci c pattern of scoring events within an individual
game.
The role of chance also has a long history of study,
typically focusing on the question of whether one success
increases the likelihood of subsequent success. This idea
can be formalized at di erent levels, e.g., success by in-
dividual players within a game [2, 16, 39], or a team s
success across multiple games [1, 32, 37]. Here, for the
 rst time, we focus on a di erent level: success by a whole
team within a game.
A simple starting point for such models is the basic
idea of many skill ranking systems [6, 11], which model
game outcomes as random variables dependent on the
competing teams  skills. We extend this idea to consider
the point-scoring events within a game to be a sequence of
independent contests. Past work supports this approach,
as some studies have found a lack of dependence between
an individual scoring and their ability to score subse-
quent points [16, 39], or between a team winning and
their chance to win future games [32, 37]. On the other
hand, there is also evidence of non-independence, e.g., the
probability of scoring itself can vary with the clock time
within a game or with the size of the lead [14, 26, 27]. To
investigate the degree to which non-independence gov-
erns scoring probabilities, we construct a sequence of
more complex models that allow speci c aspects of a
game s current state to in uence scoring rates, e.g., the
team that scored last and the lead size.
In many sports, including American football and bas-
ketball, a simple source of non-independence is a forced
change in ball possession after each scoring event, putting
the scoring team at a disadvantage. This can result in a
phenomenon called anti-persistence, in which a score by
one team is more likely to be followed by a score by their

Another potential source of non-independence is the
size of the lead itself. Past work has shown that the
observed probability of scoring next can vary with lead
size [14, 27]. A negative dependence may be the result of
strategy, e.g., a team using its best players when it falls
behind and substituting them out when they are ahead.
Such strategies have a restorative e ect on the lead size,
serving to pull the size of the lead back toward zero.
Conversely, anti-restoration or momentum occurs when
the leading team has a higher chance of scoring again,
perhaps by improving their control over the playing  eld
or by learning from gameplay how to better exploit the
weaknesses of the opposing team.
In this paper, we develop probabilistic generative mod-
els around these ideas to explore and predict the evolu-
tion of point scoring over the course of a game. We use
these models to deduce the impact of chance, strategy,
and the rules of the game itself, and to test two simple
hypotheses:
1. the probability of scoring does not depend on the
current state of the game (team skill alone mat-
ters).
2. the probability of scoring does depend on the cur-
rent game state (as well as team skill).
Our probabilistic models encode speci c instances of
these assumptions and we assess their accuracy under
two online predictive tasks. We present novel predictive
models that can not only predict the outcome of a game,
but also provide better predictions over baseline models
about the sequence of scoring events.
II. RELATED WORK
Our work addresses two novel prediction problems for
predicting Who will score next? and Who will win?, us-
ing only the sequence of scoring events that have already
occured during the game. In the following we outline re-
lated work to each of these questions in turn.
Essential to answering the question Who will score
next? is understanding the underlying mechanisms of
scoring dynamics. The study of competitive team sports
has a rich history spanning a broad selection of features
including the timing of scoring events [7, 12, 14, 21,
27, 36, 39], long-range correlations in scoring [30], the
role of timeouts [31], the identi cation of safe leads [8],
and the impact of spatial positioning and playing  eld
design [5, 26, 40]. The most relevant of these studies
focuses on the analysis of individual player  momen-
tum  or  hot-hands  [2, 16, 39] and on team winning
streaks [1, 16, 32, 37, 39]. Here, we bring together these
two ideas by considering the notion of momentum, or its
reverse  restoration , at the team level. Although some
analysis has previously been undertaken in this direc-
tion [14], we go further to provide the  rst predictive
models that answer the question: Who will score next?
2
The foundations of our approach lie in the  eld of skill
modeling and team ranking [6, 11], which originated in
the mid-20th century. Work in this area includes the
ranking of individuals [9, 11, 17], teams [18, 32, 35],
or both [20, 22]. These models have been applied to a
wide range of competitive events, including baseball [32],
chess [9, 11, 17], American football [18, 35], association
football (soccer) [23], and tennis [17]. More recently, they
have been adapted to matchmaking problems in online
games [20] and to calibrating reviewer scores in computer
science conferences [13].
Our work is the  rst to use skill ranking models to pre-
dict Who will win? by predicting the sequence of scoring
events within a game. Skill ranking models have previ-
ously been applied to predicting game outcomes but only
based on the  nal outcome of the game, either in terms
of the win/loss result or the  nal point di erence. These
past approaches thus cannot update their prediction as
the game unfolds, while our models can. We train on a
history of scoring event sequences so that we may pre-
dict Who will win? in an online fashion. Some commer-
cial online sports betting systems exist that make similar
online predictions, but these systems are proprietary and
closed, which precludes a scienti c evaluation or compar-
ison with our models. They are not considered hereafter.
III. SPORTS DATASETS
We use scoring event data1 from four team sports:
college-level American football (CFB, 10 seasons; 2000-
2009), professional American football (NFL, 10 seasons;
2000-2009), hockey (NHL, 9 seasons; 2000-2003, 2005-
2009)2 and basketball (NBA, 9 seasons; 2002-2010). Each
dataset consists of the set of scoring events for each game
played in the season. It includes the time the event was
scored, the team and player that scored, and its point
value. Table I gives a summary of these data including the
number of teams, games, and individual scoring events.
In our analysis and modeling, we discard the timestamps
of the events and instead consider only the order in which
events appear within a game.
A. Preprocessing
We extract from the raw event data two sequences to
represent each game: a point sequence  , where  i is the
point value of scoring event i in the game, and a team
sequence  , where  i   {r, b} is the identity of the team
that won those points. If there are Nt events in game

for team labels r and b (arbitrarily chosen), where  (., .)
is the Kronecker delta function and by convention we
compute L from team r s perspective.
We begin by removing some games and scoring events.
We remove any events that occur during regulation over-
time (0.88% of all events), because these events follow
di erent scoring processes than events in regular game
time [27]. Additionally, any games in which only one team
scored are removed (6.24% of all games), as the raw data
do not indicate the identity of the non-scoring team.
Under certain game conditions, multiple scoring
events, potentially by di erent teams, can occur at the
same game clock time. For example, in American foot-
ball, the clock is stopped after a touchdown is scored but
the scoring team gets a chance to score a conversion. If
the conversion is unsuccessful, occasionally the opposing
team gains control and scores points before the clock is
restarted. Similarly, in basketball, the clock is stopped
during free throws after a foul, after which the ball is
inbounded (thrown in). If the ball is inbounded close to
the other basket, it is possible to score before a second
has elapsed on the clock. In these cases, the ordering of
these events is ambiguous.
Removing these events would alter the running lead
size, which is one of the game states of interest. Instead,
we merge simultaneous events into a single scoring play
that removes the ordering ambiguity while preserving the
correct score. If one team scores two simultaneous events
i and i + 1, we merge their values, setting  i =  i +  i+1,
and removing event i + 1 from both sequences. If two
teams score simultaneously, we merge their values with
that of the immediately preceding event in a way that
preserves the running lead. Speci cally, we set  i 1 =
 i 1   | i    i+1|, where the sign is consistent with the
previous assignment of r and b labels to teams, and then
remove events i and i + 1 from both sequences.
B. Scoring and lead size
We use these point and team sequences to make an
initial investigation of our hypotheses. If the scoring dy-

its lead size, for the observed (yellow ) and simulated (black )
patterns, each with a linear least squares  t line. The simu-
lated scoring sequence assumes that the probability of scoring
is independent of the game s state.
namics are truly independent of the game s state, these
dynamics will be indistinguishable from an independent
Bernoulli process, in which each Bernoulli trial represents
a scoring event. We evaluate this model by calculating
the empirical probability that a team will score the next
event as a function of the current lead size L. Recall that
we compute L from the perspective of team r; thus, if r
is leading, then L is positive, while if r is trailing, then
L is negative (and vice versa for b). This function is thus
rotationally symmetric about a lead of L = 0, where
neither team leads, and has the mathematical form of
P ( i = r | Li 1) = 1   P ( i = b|  Li 1).
(cid:80)N
We compare the empirical scoring function to one cal-
culated from synthetic team sequences generated accord-
ing to an independent Bernoulli process, in which we  ip
a biased coin to determine which team wins each scoring
event. The coin s bias is determined by the proportion of
scoring events each team wins in that particular game,
1
i=1  ( i, r) (or for b). In this simulation, events are
N
thus independent of the game state (hypothesis 1). We
also compute a least-squares regression line for the em-
pirical and for the synthetic data, in which each point
is given weight proportional to the number of times the
corresponding lead size was observed.
All of the resulting gradients relating scoring probabil-
ity to lead size are nonzero (Fig. 1), and each Bernoulli
process produces a positive gradient. This pattern simply
re ects the empirical distribution of biases used to sim-
ulate the ensemble of games, with a more positive slope
re ecting broader variance in these biases. The variance
in the estimated scoring probability increases with lead
size simply because progressively fewer games produce
leads of that magnitude.
Comparing the observed and simulated scoring func-
tions (Fig. 1), we observe a clear contradiction. The gra-
dient and, in particular for NBA, the range of lead sizes
generated by the Bernoulli process disagree strongly with
those properties observed in the empirical data. These re-
sults suggest that the probability of scoring does indeed
depend, somehow, on the game state (hypothesis 2). In
subsequent sections, we investigate this dependence us-
ing sophisticated probabilistic models to determine how
the probability of scoring depends on game state.
IV. WHERE STANDARD TESTS FAIL
To determine whether scoring events are independent,
we now apply a suite of statistical randomization tests,
which compare observed sequences to random sequences
with similar properties. Speci cally, we employ the
  serial test (non-uniformity),
  Wald-Wolfowitz runs test (anti-restoration), and
  autocorrelation test (persistence/anti-persistence),
where for each the null hypothesis is that the team se-
quence   is simply a random sequence.
The serial test [25] examines bigram frequencies in a
sequence and compares them to their expected frequen-
cies under a uniformly random sequence. For a team se-
quence with N elements, the observed fractions of bi-
grams {rr, rb, br, bb} are compared to their expectations
of N/4. This test can identify the existence of a bias
within each game, i.e., if one team is systematically more
likely to score than another.
The Wald-Wolfowitz runs test [38] examines the ob-
served number of runs in a sequence, i.e., substrings of  
for which each element is the same (either r or b), which
allows us to identify either positive momentum or anti-
restorative e ects in within-game scoring. We reject the
null hypothesis that   is random if the observed number
of runs is signi cantly below its expected value. Previ-
ously, this test has been used to detect winning streaks
in sequences of games [37].
The autocorrelation test measures the correlation of a
sequence with itself, shifted by one element, which allows
us to identify periodic dynamics that occur as a result of
anti-persistence. Here, we reject the null hypothesis that
  contains no dependence between values if the autocor-
relation is signi cantly higher or lower than zero.
We apply each of these three tests to each of our four
data sets, and compare the results against a false positive
4
FIG. 2. (top) Probability distributions for the number of scor-
ing events in a game, and (bottom) the randomization test
results for each sport, by season, versus a false positive rate
of   = 0.05 (dashed line). The team sequences of each game
are tested independently and we plot the proportion of games
that reject the null hypothesis that the sequences are random.
Because CFB, NFL and NHL typically have a small number of
events per game (upper panel), the null hypothesis is di cult
to reject.
rate of   = 0.05 (Fig. 2). We also consider each season
separately so as to reveal non-stationarities. Basketball,
unlike the other sports, produces a large proportion of
rejections for the serial and autocorrelation tests, which
re ects the known anti-persistence pattern in basketball
scoring [14].
On the other hand, for all sports except basketball,
each of these tests rejects the null hypothesis at close to
or below the chosen false positive rate, a  nding consis-
tent with each of these sequences being random. How-
ever, this interpretation is problematic. The serial test
makes the very strict assumption that each sequence is
drawn from a uniform random distribution, i.e., each is
generated by  ipping a fair coin several times. A face-
value interpretation thus implies that all teams have an
equal chance of winning each game a highly unlikely
situation and it predicts that the scoring function from
Section III B should be independent of lead size, which
contradicts the observed pattern (Fig. 1).
In fact, however, there is no contradiction: the   se-
quences are simply too short (Fig. 1) for these tests to
reliably distinguish random from non-random sequences
when we assume they are generated independently, i.e.,
the tests have low statistical power. The one exception
is basketball, whose sequences typically contain 90 or so
events, while those for American football or hockey typ-
ically contain less than 10.
In the following sections, we show how to circumvent
the low statistical power of these tests by exploiting the
fact that team sequences are not, in fact, independent
of each other. Instead, each season s sequences are gen-
erated by repeatedly selecting pairs from a  nite and
 xed population of teams. This process induces substan-
tial correlations across games that we can capture by
modeling the latent skills of each team within a given
season.
V. SKILL-BASED SCORING DYNAMICS
Toward this end, we develop a series of models of in-
creasing complexity based on speci c underlying mech-
anisms for sports scoring dynamics, including indepen-
dence, restoration, and anti-persistence. Each of these
models represents team skill as a latent variable. We as-
sume that team skill is  xed over the course of any partic-
ular season [18], which re ects the relatively stable team
rosters and coaching sta s, and low injuries rates in these
sports. Furthermore, modeling each season separately al-
lows us to run multiple tests for each sport one for each
season and allows our models to capture real changes
in team skill across seasons [18].
Each of our models generates a team sequence   by
extending the popular Bradley-Terry (BT) model [6] to
generate individual scoring events within a game. Tra-
ditionally, the BT model is used to estimate unobserved
(latent) team skills from the observed outcomes of many
games among pairs of teams. The probability that team
r wins in a match against team b is given by the skill of
r relative to b:
P (r wins against b) = drb =
 r
 r +  b
,
(2)
where  r,  b   [0, 1] is the latent skill for team r.
A.
Independent model
When scoring events within a game are independent,
their generation is equivalent to a simple Bernoulli pro-
cess with a game-speci c bias. This is equivalent to an
 independent model  that applies the game-level BT
model of Eq. (2) to each of the individual scoring events
within a game, yielding
P ( i = r) = drb .
(3)
This represents our  rst model, which can capture vari-
ability in a team sequence caused by di erences in team
skill parameters, but not other sources of variability.
B. Restorative models
Real scoring functions (Fig. 1) produce a range of gra-
dients. However, the independent model can only pro-
duce positive slopes. To capture a wider variety of scor-
ing function shapes, and in particular a negative slope or
 restorative  pattern, we extend the independent model
by allowing each team s skill to explicitly covary with
5
its lead. Such a relationship could arise for psychological
reasons, e.g., a winning team  loses steam  or a losing
team gains motivation [4], or for strategic reasons, e.g.,
substituting out or in the more skilled players while in
the lead in order to conserve their energy, avoid injury,
or create momentum [27].
Our restorative model augments the independent
model with an explicit per-team  restorative force  pa-
rameter  r, which modi es team r s strength in response
to the current lead size from its perspective (cid:96)r and cap-
tures the fact that di erent teams may have di erent
behaviors in response to how far ahead or behind they
are. When  r < 0, team r exhibits a restorative pattern,
with skill being proportional to  (cid:96)r. When  r > 0, team
r exhibits an anti-restorative or momentum pattern, with
skill being proportional to (cid:96)r.
The probability that team r scores against b is given
by
P ( i = r) = drb + (cid:96)ircrb ,
where (cid:96)ir is r s lead size just before event i and
crb =  r +  b = cbr .
(4)
(5)
A game as a whole exhibits a restorative pattern when-
ever crb < 0. This occurs either when both teams exhibit
a restorative pattern themselves ( r < 0 and  b < 0) or
when one team s restorative force is stronger than the
other team s anti-restorative force ( r < 0,  b > 0, and
| r| > | b|).
The additional term in Eq. (4) relative to the in-
dependent model means this model s scoring function
is no longer bounded on the [0, 1] interval. We correct
this behavior by using a sigmoid function of the form
 1 to provide a smooth and continuous
 (x) = (1 + e x)
approximation of the misspeci ed linear function.
To make this approximation, we change variables so
that a logistic curve most closely approximates the linear
equation, which occurs when we match the gradients at
the point of symmetry at P ( i = r) = 1/2. Setting the
derivative  (cid:48) equal to crb, we  nd
 (cid:48)(mrb(cid:96)ir + vrb) =
mrbemrb(cid:96)ir+vrb
(emrb(cid:96)ir + evrb)2 = crb ,
(6)
We then solve for when the logistic function equals 1/2,
yielding
 (mrb(cid:96)ir + vrb) =
1
1 + e (mrb(cid:96)ir+vrb)
= 1/2 .
(7)
Finally, in solving Eqs. (6) and (7) we obtain the fol-
lowing transformation of variables:
vrb =  4 (1/2   drb)
mrb = 4 crb ,
(8)
(9)
where mrb and vrb are the variables used in the logistic
function such that crb and drb retain their linear interpre-
tation and are thus comparable to the skill variables in
6
model goodness-of- t by calculating the held out like-
lihood for each model under a 10-fold cross validation.
Furthermore, we follow this procedure for each season of
each sport separately, the results of which are given in
Tables II V. By treating seasons independently, we ob-
tain multiple model assessments within each sport while
controlling for within season variability. For each season,
we highlight the two highest scores in blue and the high-
est score in bold.
In basketball (NBA), we  nd that the restorative anti-
persistent model consistently provides the best  t across
all seasons (Table II), with the second best model be-
ing the independent anti-persistent model. These results
indicate a strong role for both restoration and anti-
persistence in driving basketball scoring dynamics. Pre-
vious analysis of basketball scoring using random walk
theory came to similar conclusions [14].
American football (NFL and CFB) shows a di erent
result, with both types of independent model being heav-
ily favored over both types of restorative model (Tables
III and IV). The poor  t here of the restorative models
indicates that the competitive processes that produce a
restorative force in basketball are largely absent in Amer-
ican football. This di erence may be related to the much
greater scoring rate in basketball relative to American
football (Fig. 2): an increased scoring rate lowers the
marginal value of each scoring event relative to the game
outcome (who wins), and low value interactions in other
systems are associated with restorative forces [10, 19].
Furthermore, the anti-persistent model for NFL is fa-
vored in 8 of 10 seasons over the independent model,
while in CFB, it is favored in only 2 of 10 seasons. That
is, anti-persistence appears to play a stronger role in NFL
games than in CFB games. In fact, CFB is the only sport
to strongly favor the independent model, a result that
agrees with the our previous simulation results (Fig. 1),
which showed that the trivial independent model pro-
duced the smallest disagreement for CFB between real
and simulated scoring function gradients among the four
sports.
The results for hockey (NHL) are less clear cut (Ta-
ble V). In 8 out of 9 seasons, the independent anti-
persistent model is either the best or second best model,
and the independent model is best or second best in
7 out of 9. On the other hand, the simple restorative
model wins for 2 seasons, and is second best for one.
(The restorative anti-persistent model is a poor  t for
all hockey seasons.) We note, however, that the log-
likelihoods among these three models are all very close,
indicating that each performs about as well as the oth-
ers for these data. Given that NHL is also the one sport
among the four that is not anti-persistent by design (pos-
session is determined by a  faceo   after each goal) and
that its scoring function has a negative gradient, we ten-
tatively conclude that the restorative model is better.
Across seasons, the best overall models appear to be
CFB:
independent anti-persistent;
NBA: restorative anti-persistent; and NHL: restorative.
independent; NFL:

functions using the change of variables in Eqs. (8) and (9).
the independent scoring model. Figure 3 shows examples
of two linear functions and their corresponding logistic
approximations.
C. Anti-persistence models
In many sports, we observe an anti-persistent pattern
in the team sequences, in which the probability that
r scores next depends on which team scored last, i.e.,
P ( i+1 = r |  i). For example, for NBA team sequences,
the rate of rr and bb bigrams is only 0.35, indicating
strong anti-persistence. (The rates for CFB, NFL, and
NHL are 0.45, 0.44, and 0.49, respectively.) Such an anti-
persistence pattern can occur when teams have di erent
degrees of skill at defensive and o ensive play, e.g., when
both teams have o enses that are relatively stronger than
the opposing team s defense.
To capture these e ects, we extend the independent
model so that each team has an o ensive skill parame-
ter  o  and a defensive parameter  def . For sports like
American football and basketball, ball possession (o en-
sive play) typically alternates after a scoring event. We
model this game rule by applying a team s defensive skill
immediately after it scores and its o ensive skill after the
other team scores. Under this independent anti-persistent

season, and comparing the simulated and empirical scor-
ing functions. That is, we repeat the assessment of Fig-
ure 1, but now using models that can capture depen-
dence across sequences. The results show that our skill-
based models are a dramatic improvement over simulat-
ing each game independently (Fig. 4), agreeing closely
with the empirical scoring patterns in both the gradient
and range of lead sizes.
VII. PREDICTING OUTCOMES
We now apply our models to two online prediction
tasks in each of the sports: Who will score next? and
Who will win? For both tasks, we let our models observe
the point and team sequences of the  rst T games in a
particular season. We then use these models to predict
for each unobserved game in that season (i) the team se-
quence values  i for 1   i   N , and (ii) the identity of
the winning team, when each model is allowed to observe
the game states ( j,  j) for 1   j < i. In the second task,
all models predict point values  i as the mean value (cid:104) (cid:105)
averaged over all events in the season. We compare our
predictions to those of three baseline models.
The  rst baseline is a na  ve leading model, which as-
sumes that the team currently in the lead is the stronger
FIG. 4. Probability that a team scores next as a function of
its lead size, for the observed (yellow ) and simulated (black )
patterns, each with a linear least squares  t line. Each simula-
tion uses the best overall skill model for that sport to generate
synthetic point and team sequences.
We check these models by performing a semi-parametric
bootstrap, generating synthetic   and   sequences of the
same number and lengths as observed empirically in each
8
A. Who will score next?
In the  rst task, we aim to predict which team will
score event i, for each 1   i   N , given the sequence
of preceding game states ( j,  j) for 1   j < i. For this
online prediction task, we learn each model s parameters
from the  rst T games in a season and then make pre-
dictions across all unobserved games within a season and
calculate the AUC for all predictions across all seasons to
obtain a single score. Each model observes at least 10%
of a season, which ensures that every team has played at
least a few times.
The results show that the overall best models identi ed
in the previous section also tend to be the best predictors
at who will score next (Fig. 5), although some alternative
models also perform well. For instance, the best model for
NFL games early in the season is the  rst order Markov
model; however, the best NFL model beats this baseline
after about 30% of a season is observed. Similarly, the
 rst order Markov model performs almost as well as the
best skill model in predicting who will score next in NBA
games, by capturing the known anti-persistence pattern
in that sport. One of the worst models across all four
sports is the leading baseline, which often performs only
slightly better than chance.
B. Who will win?
Predicting who will win a game requires extrapolating
the point and team sequences to determine the game s
 nal outcome. We simplify this task slightly by assum-
ing that the number of scoring events N in each game is
known. We then allow the models to learn their parame-
ters from the  rst 30% of each season (other choices lead
to qualitatively similar results as those reported here).
For each game in the remainder of a season, the models
predict the identity of the winning team when they are al-
lowed to observe a progressively greater fraction of game
states ( i,  i) for 0.1   i/N   0.9 as if each model were
watching the game unfold in real time.
The results show that the overall best model for each
sport both consistently outperforms the baselines and
also correctly predicts the winner with at least 80% ac-
curacy at a game s halftime (Fig. 6).
The relatively poorer performance of the  leading 
baseline model
illustrates that this prediction task is
non-trivial who is leading at a given moment is not
as predictive of who wins as knowing something about
team skills and scoring dynamics. On the other hand, the
Bradley-Terry baseline performs comparably well very
early in the game, but is quickly beaten because it cannot
learn from the real-time evolution of a game.
For this task, most of our skill-based models make very
similar predictions and the  rst order Markov model also
performs well. Although the distributions of  nal lead
sizes may be di erent, the means are very close, and the
individual predictions across models correlate strongly.
.
FIG. 5. Probability of accurately predicting which team will
score next (AUC), when models observe di erent fractions of
a season. Based on 95% con dence intervals, our best model

CFB and NBA, and after observing at least half of the season
for NFL and NHL.
team and thus more likely to both score next and win
the game. Speci cally, it predicts that team holding the
lead at event i will win the next event, i.e., it predicts
 i+1 = r if L > 0 and  i+1 = b if L < 0, and will also
win the game. If L = 0, the model  ips a fair coin for r
and b.
The second baseline is the standard Bradley-Terry
model in which we infer latent team skills   from the win-
loss records among teams in the observed games. This
model is simpler than our independent model, which in-
fers team skills using team sequences { } of the observed
games.
The third baseline is a simple  rst order Markov
model. It predicts that the next team to score will either
be the same or di erent than the team that scored last ac-
cording to the empirical bigram frequencies {rr, bb, rb, br}
observed in the  rst T games of the season. Formally, it
predicts that a team will score again given it scored last
time as
P ( i+1=  i) =
 ( i+1,  i)
t=1
i=1
t=1
(11)
For both prediction tasks, we assess prediction accu-
racy via AUC statistic, which gives the probability that
a randomly selected true positive is ranked above a ran-
domly selected false positive. The AUC is a statistically
principled measure for binary classi cation tasks like ours
where the cost of an error is the same in either direction
(since team labels, r or b, are arbitrary).

the current state of the game.
The greatest di erence occurs at the start of the game. In
particular, the  rst order Markov model performs much
worse than the skill-based models at the beginning be-
cause it has no information about the heterogeneity of
team scoring abilities. As the game progresses the predic-
tions tend to converge. This occurs because these models
all make predictions based on random walks on a binary
sequence {r, b}, the di erence being in how they model
the transition probabilities. Later in the game we extrap-
olate less and so the di erences between models become
less pronounced.
VIII. TEAM SKILL EVOLVES OVER TIME
A useful feature of our probabilistic models is the in-
terpretability of their parameters, which are meaningful
measures of team skill here. By learning these parame-
ters independently for each season in each sport, we can
investigate how team skills have evolved over time.
Using the best overall model for each sport, we learn
its parameters using all data in each particular season
and calculate the Spearman rank correlation across team
skills for each pair of seasons (Fig. 7). We  nd that
the relative ordering of teams by their inferred skills ex-
hibits strong serial correlation over time, which appears
as a strong diagonal component in the pairwise correla-
tion matrices. The low or inverse correlation in the far
o -diagonal elements, as well as the block-like patterns
observed in CFB and NFL, implies an underlying non-
stationarity in team skills for each of the leagues over the
roughly 10-year span of data.
The manner in which team rosters change over time
is a likely source of such long-term dynamics in relative
team skill. At short time scales, team rosters are fairly
stable, with only a few players changing from season to
season. However, over longer time scales, these changes
accumulate, and rosters separated in time by more than a
FIG. 7. Correlation of inferred skills over years for each sport.
We see that the highest correlations occur along the block di-
agonal indicating that adjacent years are more similar. Note
that the scale is di erent for CFB due to a much higher cor-
relation across all years.
few years are likely to be very di erent, with concomitant
di erences in team skill.
The exception to this pattern is CFB, which shows a
larger long-term correlation, i.e., a slower rate of change
in relative team skills, than in professional sports. We
speculate that this di erence is caused by the di erence
in player mobility between college and professional-level
sports: professional teams operate in a national player
market, and players can move relatively freely among
teams, while colleges operate as rough regional monopo-
lies over the sources of their players.
The inferred season-by-season skill orderings them-
selves are also of interest, as they reveal the particular
trajectories of individual teams over time. We show vi-
sualizations of these trajectories for NBA and NFL in
Figures 8 and 9. We omit CFB because there are too
many teams (461) to meaningfully visualize and NHL for
space reasons.
For each plot we highlight the two teams that won the
league championship (NFL Super Bowl and NBA Finals)
more than once during the period covered by the dataset.
It is notable that these teams are not necessarily the most
skilled teams under our model. This is unsurprising, as
tournaments by bracket are the highest variance method
of identifying the most skilled team [3]. Interestingly, in
both NFL and NBA games, the highlighted teams tend
to have strong o ensive skills, while their defensive skills
are more variable. This pattern suggests that o ensive
skills are more important for winning games, which seems
reasonable given that a strong defense alone cannot win
a game.
Looking at individual teams, we can see how their
skills change with respect to the total ordering. For in-
stance, the Cleveland Cavaliers drafted LeBron James in
2003 and went from being ranked the third worst (of-

are highlighted, i.e., Lakers (orange) 2002, 2009 and 2010, Spurs (black ) 2003, 2005 and 2007.

fensive) team to a mid-range one. When James left for
Miami Heat at the start of the 2010 11 season, we see
the Cavaliers  o ensive skill drop to the bottom ranked
team, while Miami Heat s o ensive and defensive skills
increased to be ranked third and  rst respectively. We
also see that the Los Angeles Lakers  skills (both o en-
sive and defensive) drop for the 2004 05 season. After
facing a di cult 2003-04 season [24], they disbanded the
team, lost their coach and faced a number of injuries,
resulting in a poorer performance in 2004 05.
Finally, the range of values occupied by o ensive and
defensive skills is di erent between NFL and NBA teams:
in the latter, these two skills occupy non-overlapping
ranges (large and small respectively), while in the for-
mer, they fall in similar ranges. That is, NBA teams are
less likely to score when playing defensively than when
they have possession of the ball, which serves to create a
stronger anti-persistence scoring pattern (0.36) than for
NFL (0.44), where skills are more evenly matched.
IX. CONCLUSION
In this work we considered the online prediction tasks
of Who will score next? and Who will win? based on the
sequence of scoring events in the game so far. Our proba-
bilistic models based on latent team skills perform well at
both predictive tasks and can predict with a high degree
of certainty (> 80%) who will win a game in each of the
four leagues we studied, after only half of the game has
elapsed. Furthermore, by using gameplay, i.e., the partic-
ular sequence of events within each game, to model team
skill rather than just game outcomes, we can infer di er-
ent types of latent team skills e.g., o ensive vs. defensive
skills.
Our statistical models provide a quantitative and prin-
cipled means of capturing and testing hypotheses about
the variability induced by chance, the biases produced by
real di erences in team skill, and the structural impact
of game-speci c rules. In applying these models to com-
prehensive data from four di erent sports, we found that
each of the leagues is best  t by a di erent model. This
11
indicates that skill, luck, strategy, and the rules of the
game serve di erent roles in the scoring dynamics across
sports. The exception was professional hockey (NHL),
where the very low scoring rate resulted in no clear pre-
dictive winner among our models.
Our models and results open up many new directions
for future work. For instance, we could incorporate other
data such as player or ball positioning [5, 40], or the
timing of events [27] to improve our models and allow us
to apply them to low scoring sports such as soccer. These
models could also be used to make other predictions, e.g.,
the number of scoring events in a game, the  nal score,
and when a lead is safe [8], and to produce more rigorous
team rankings (Figs. 8 and 9).
In addition to data on gameplay, data on individual
player attributes and performance in competitive settings
are also often available, e.g., height, strength, speed, ac-
curacy when scoring, defensive skill, passing skill, etc.
However, there are no good models that connect these
characteristics to team skills and to gameplay as a means
of predicting game outcomes. The models we formulated
here solve part of this problem by connecting team skill to
gameplay. An interesting direction for future work would
be to predict outcomes from player statistics via team
skills as an intermediary. Such a model would allow teams
to make more data-driven choices about how they build
team rosters and train their players. This extension of
our work would also open up new avenues in designing
realistic simulations of competitive play, e.g., for better
AI in video games.
