The Majority Illusion in Social Networks
USC Information Sciences Institute, 4676 Admiralty Way, Marina del Rey, CA 90292

(Dated: June 10, 2015)
Social behaviors are often contagious, spreading through a population as individuals imitate the
decisions and choices of others. A variety of global phenomena, from innovation adoption to the
emergence of social norms and political movements, arise as a result of people following a simple
local rule, such as copy what others are doing. However, individuals often lack global knowledge of
the behaviors of others and must estimate them from the observations of their friends  behaviors.
In some cases, the structure of the underlying social network can dramatically skew an individual s
local observations, making a behavior appear far more common locally than it is globally. We trace
the origins of this phenomenon, which we call  the majority illusion,  to the friendship paradox in
social networks. As a result of this paradox, a behavior that is globally rare may be systematically
overrepresented in the local neighborhoods of many people, i.e., among their friends. Thus, the
 majority illusion  may facilitate the spread of social contagions in networks and also explain why
systematic biases in social perceptions, for example, of risky behavior, arise. Using synthetic and
real-world networks, we explore how the  majority illusion  depends on network structure and
develop a statistical model to calculate its magnitude in a network.
I.
INTRODUCTION
An individual s behavior often depends on the
actions of others [8, 9, 17, 29, 30, 33]. This
phenomenon is manifested daily in the decisions
people make to adopt a new technology [28, 31]
or idea [7, 33],
listen to music [29], engage
in risky behavior [4], or join a social move-
ment [17, 30]. As a result, a variety of behav-
iors are said to be  contagious , because they
spread through the population as people observe
others adopting the behavior and then adopt it
themselves. In some cases, behaviors will spread
from a small number of initial adopters to a
large portion of the population, resulting in fads,
hit songs, successful political campaigns, epi-
demics, and social norms. Researchers have ex-
amined the conditions under which such global
outbreaks occur, especially in a networked set-
ting, where individuals interact with a subset of
the population, i.e., their network neighbors or
friends. Studies have linked the onset of global
outbreaks to the topology of underlying net-
work [9, 32], including the presence of highly
connected individuals [21, 25] and small clusters
of connected people [8, 33]. However, network
structure can a ect the emergence of global out-
breaks in a subtler way. As we show in this
paper, the con guration of initial adopters on
a network can systematically skew the obser-
vations people make of their friends  behavior.
This can make some behavior appear much more
popular than it is, thus creating conditions for
its spread.
Networks often have counter-intuitive proper-
ties. One of the better known of these is the
friendship paradox, which states that, on aver-
age, most people have fewer friends than their
friends have [14]. Despite its almost nonsensical
nature, the friendship paradox has been used to
design e cient strategies for vaccination [12], so-
cial intervention [22], and early detection of con-
tagious outbreaks [11, 16]. In a nutshell, rather
than monitoring random people to catch a con-
tagious outbreak in its early stages, the friend-
ship paradox suggests monitoring their random
friends, because they are more likely to be bet-
ter connected and not only to get sick earlier,
but also to infect more people once sick.
Recently, friendship paradox was generalized
for attributes other than degree, i.e., number
of network neighbors. For example, your co-
authors are cited more often than you [13], and
the people you follow on Twitter post more fre-
quently than you do [19]. In fact, any attribute
that is correlated with degree will produce a
paradox [13, 23]. Thus, if heavy drinkers also
happen to be more popular, then people exam-
ining their friends  drinking behavior will con-
clude that, on average, their friends drink more
than they do. This may help explain why adoles-
cents systematically overestimate their friends 
alcohol consumption and drug use [3, 6].
In this paper, we describe a novel variation
of the friendship paradox that is essential for
understanding contagious behaviors. The para-
dox applies to networks in which nodes have at-
tributes, in the simplest case a binary attribute,
such as  has red hair  vs  does not have red
hair  or  purchased an iPhone  vs  did not pur-
chase an iPhone . We refer to nodes that have
this attribute as  active , and the rest are  in-
active.  We show that under some conditions,
a large fraction of nodes will observe most of
their neighbors in the active state, even when
it is globally rare. For this reason, we call the
paradox the  majority illusion. 
As a simple illustration of the  majority il-
lusion  paradox, consider the two networks in
Figure 1. The networks are identical, except for
which of the few nodes are colored. Imagine that
colored nodes are active and the rest of the nodes
are inactive. Despite this apparently small dif-
ference, the two networks are profoundly di er-
ent: in the  rst network, every inactive node will
examine its neighbors to observe that  at least
half of my neighbors are active,  while in the
second network no node will make this observa-
tion. Thus, even though only three of the 14
nodes are active, it appears to all inactive nodes
in the  rst network that most of their neighbors
are active.
The  majority illusion  can dramatically im-
pact social contagions. Researchers use the
threshold model to describe the spread of social
contagions in networks [10, 17, 32]. At each time
step in this model, an inactive individual ob-
serves the current states of its k neighbors, and
becomes active if more than  k of the neighbors
are active; otherwise, it remains inactive. The
fraction 0       1 is the activation threshold.
It represents the amount of social proof an in-
dividual requires before switching to the active
state [17]. Threshold of   = 0.5 means that to
become active, an individual has to have a ma-
jority neighbors in the active state. Though the
two networks in Figure 1 have the same topol-
ogy, when the threshold is   = 0.5, all nodes
will eventually become active in the network on
the left, but not in the network on the right.
This is because the  majority illusion  alters lo-
cal neighborhoods of the nodes, distorting their
perceptions of the prevalence of the active state.
This paper describes and analyzes the  major-
ity illusion  paradox. We measure the strength
of the paradox as the fraction of network nodes
with a majority active neighbors. Using syn-
thetic and real-world networks, we study how
network structure and con guration of active
nodes contributes to the paradox. We demon-
strate empirically, as well as through theoreti-
cal analysis, that the paradox is stronger in net-
works in which the better-connected nodes are
active, and also in networks with a heteroge-
neous degree distribution. Network structure
also ampli es the paradox via degree correla-
tions. The paradox is strongest in networks
where low degree nodes have the tendency to
2
connect to high degree nodes. Activating the
high degree nodes in such networks biases the
local observations of many nodes, which in turn
impacts collective phenomena emerging in net-
works, including social contagions. Our statisti-
cal model quanti es the strength of this e ect.
II. RESULTS
A network s structure is partly speci ed by its
degree distribution p(k), which gives the proba-
bility that a randomly chosen node in an undi-
rected network has k neighbors (i.e., degree k).
This quantity also a ects the probability that a
randomly chosen edge is connected to a node of
degree k, otherwise known as neighbor degree
distribution q(k). Since high degree nodes have
more edges, they will be over-represented in the
neighbor degree distribution by a factor propor-
tional to their degree; hence, q(k) = kp(k)/ hki,
where hki is the average node degree.
Networks often have structure beyond that
speci ed by their degree distribution:
for ex-
ample, nodes may preferentially link to others
with a similar (or very di erent) degree. Such
degree correlation is captured by the joint de-
gree distribution e(k, k ), the probability to  nd
nodes of degrees k and k  at either end of a
randomly chosen edge in an undirected net-
work [27]. This quantity obeys normalization
conditions Pkk  e(k, k ) = 1 and Pk  e(k, k ) =
q(k). Globally, degree correlation in an undi-
rected network is quanti ed by the assortativity
coe cient, which is simply the Pearson correla-
tion between degrees of connected nodes:

Here,  2
tative networks (r > 0), nodes have a tendency
link to similar nodes, e.g., high-degree nodes to
other high-degree nodes. In disassortative net-
works (r < 0), on the other hand, they prefer to
link to dissimilar nodes. A star composed of a
central hub and nodes linked only to the hub is
an example of a disassortative network.
We can use Newman s edge rewiring proce-
dure [27] to change a network s assortativity
without changing its degree distribution p(k).
The rewiring procedure randomly chooses two
pairs of connected nodes and swaps their edges

three nodes are colored. These are the  active  nodes and the rest are  inactive.  In the network on the

the right, no  inactive  node makes this observation.
if doing so changes their degree correlation. This
can be repeated until desired assortativity is
achieved.
The con guration of attributes in a network
is speci ed by the joint probability distribution
P (x, k), the probability that node of degree k
has an attribute x.
In this work, we consider
binary attributes only, and refer to nodes with
x = 1 as active and those with x = 0 as inactive.
The joint distribution can be used to compute
 kx, the correlation between node degrees and
attributes:
 kx  
=
=
1
 x k Xx,k
 x k Xk
1
xk [P (x, k)   P (x)p(k)]
(1)
k [P (x = 1, k)   P (x = 1)p(k)]
P (x = 1)
 x k
[hkix=1   hki] .
In the equations above,  k and  x are the stan-
dard deviations of the degree and attribute dis-
tributions respectively, and hkix=1 is the average
degree of active nodes.
Randomly activating nodes creates a con gu-
ration with  kx close to zero. We can change it
by swapping attribute values among the nodes.
For example, to increase  kx, we randomly
choose nodes v1 with x = 1 and v0 with x = 0
and swap their attributes if the degree of v0 is
greater than the degree of v1. We can continue
swapping attributes until desired  kx is achieved
(or it no longer changes).
A.  Majority Illusion  in Synthetic and
Real-world Networks
Synthetic networks allow us to systematically
study how network structure a ects the strength
of the  majority illusion  paradox. First, we
looked at scale-free networks. We generated net-
works with N = 10, 000 nodes and degree distri-
bution of the form p(k)   k  . Such networks
are used to model the heterogeneous structure of
many real-world networks, which contain a few
high degree hubs and many low degree nodes.
To create a scale-free network, we  rst sampled
a degree sequence from a distribution with ex-
ponent  , where exponent   took three di er-
ent values (2.1, 2.4, and 3.1), and then used the
con guration model to create an undirected net-
work with that degree sequence (see Appendix
Sec. S1). We activated P (x = 1) = 0.05
of nodes and used edge rewiring and attribute
swapping procedures describe above to change
the network s degree assortativity r and degree 
attribute correlation  kx.
Figure 2 shows the fraction of nodes with a
majority active neighbors in these scale-free net-
works as a function of the degree attribute cor-
relation  kx and for di erent values of degree as-
sortativity r. The fraction of nodes experiencing
the  majority illusion  can be quite large. For
  = 2.1, 60% 80% of the nodes may observe a
majority active neighbors, even though only 5%
of the nodes are, in fact, active. The  majority
illusion  is exacerbated by three factors: it be-
comes stronger as the degree attribute correla-
tion increases, and as the network becomes more
disassortative (i.e., r decreases) and heavier-

tailed (i.e.,   becomes smaller). However, even
when   = 3.1, under some conditions a substan-
tial fraction of nodes will experience the para-
dox. The lines in the  gure show show theoret-
ical estimates of the paradox using Equation 4,
as described in the next subsection.
 Majority illusion  can also be observed in
networks with a Poisson degree distribution. We
used the Erd os-R enyi model to generate net-
works with N = 10, 000 and average degrees
hki = 5.2 and hki = 2.5 (see Appendix Sec. S1).
We randomly activated 5%, 10%, and 20% of
the nodes, and used edge rewiring and attribute
swapping to change r and  kx in these net-
works. Figure 3 shows the fraction of nodes
in the paradox regime. Though much reduced
compared to scale-free networks, we still observe
some amount of the paradox, especially in net-
works with a greater fraction of active nodes.
We also examined whether  majority illusion 
can be manifested in real-world networks. We
looked at three typical social and communica-
tions networks:
the co-authorship network of
high energy physicists (HepTh) [24], social me-
dia follower graph (Digg) [20], and the net-
work representing links between political blogs
(blogs) [2]. All three networks are undirected.
To make the Digg follower graph undirected, we
kept only the mutual follow links, and further re-
duced the graph by extracting the largest con-
nected component. Except for political blogs
(r =  0.22), the networks were assortative with
r = 0.23 and r = 0.12 for HepTh and Digg
respectively. These data are described in Ap-
pendix Sec. S1.
Figure 4 shows the fraction of nodes experi-
encing the  majority illusion  for di erent frac-
tions of active nodes P (x = 1) = 0.05, 0.1, 0.2
and 0.3. As degree attribute correlation  kx in-
creases, a substantial fraction of nodes experi-
ence the paradox in almost all networks. The
e ect is largest in the disassortative political
blogs network, where for high enough correla-
tion, as many as 60% 70% of nodes will have a
majority active neighbors, even when only 20%
of the nodes are active. The e ect also exists
in the Digg network of mutual followers, and to
a lesser degree in the HepTh co-authorship net-
work. Although positive assortativity reduces
the magnitude of the e ect, compared with syn-
thetic networks, local perceptions of nodes in
real-world networks can also be skewed. If the
attribute represents an opinion, under some con-
ditions, even a minority opinion can appear to
be extremely popular locally.
B. Modeling  Majority Illusion  in
Networks
Having demonstrated empirically some of the
relationships between  majority illusion  and
network structure, we next develop a model that
includes network properties in the calculation
of paradox strength. Like the friendship para-
dox, the  majority illusion  is rooted in di er-
ences between degrees of nodes and their neigh-
bors [14, 18]. These di erences result in nodes
perceiving that, not only are their neighbors bet-
ter connected [14], on average, but that they also
have more of some attribute than they them-
selves have [19]. The latter paradox, which is
referred to as the generalized friendship para-
dox, is enhanced by correlations between node
degrees and attribute values  kx [13].
In bi-
nary attribute networks, where nodes can be ei-
ther active or inactive, a con guration in which
higher degree nodes tend to be active causes the

are more active than they are (see Appendix
Sec. S1 A).
While heterogeneous degree distribution and
degree attribute correlations give rise to friend-
ship paradoxes even in random networks, other
elements of network structure, such as correla-
tion between degrees of connected nodes, may
also a ect observations nodes make of their
neighbors. To understand why, consider the
probability that a node has an active neighbor,
conditioned on that node having a degree k:
P (x  = 1|k) = Xk 
= Xk 
P (x  = 1|k )P (k |k)
(2)
P (x  = 1|k )
e(k, k )
q(k)
.
In the equation above, e(k, k ) is the joint degree
distribution. Globally, the probability that any
node has an active neighbor is
P (x  = 1) = Xk
P (x  = 1|k)p(k)
= Xk Xk 
= Xk Xk 
= Xk

Given two di erent networks with the same
degree distribution p(k) and the same con-
 guration of active nodes,
the probability
that a node in each network observes an ac-
tive neighbor P (x  = 1) is a function of
Pk,k  (k /k)e(k, k ). Since assortativity r is a
function of Pk,k  kk e(k, k ), we can see that the
two expressions weigh the e(k, k ) term in oppo-
site ways. This suggests that the probability of
having an active neighbor increases as assorta-
tivity decreases and vice versa. Thus, we expect
stronger paradoxes in disassortative networks.
To quantify the  majority illusion  paradox,
we calculate the probability that a node of de-
gree k has more than a fraction   of active neigh-
bors, i.e., neighbors with attribute value x  = 1:
P> (k) =
k
Xn> k
(cid:18)k
n(cid:19)  
(3)
P (x  = 1|k)n(1   P (x  = 1|k))(k n) .
Here P (x  = 1|k) is the conditional probability
of having an active neighbor, given a node with
degree k, and is speci ed by Eq. 2. Although
the threshold   in Eq. 3 could be any fraction, in
this paper we focus on   = 1
2 , which represents a
straight majority. Thus, the fraction of all nodes
most of whose neighbors are active is

Using Equation 4, we can calculate the
strength of the  majority illusion  paradox for
any network whose degree sequence, joint degree
distribution e(k, k ), and conditional attribute
distribution P (x|k) are known. The solid lines
in Figures 2 4 report these calculations for each
network. We used the empirically determined
joint probability distribution P (x, k) to calcu-
late P (x = 1|k) in the equation above, as well
6
as  kx for the  gure. For some  well-behaved 
degree distributions, P (x = 1|k) can be deter-
mined analytically (rather than empirically) by
approximating the joint distribution P (x, k) as
a bivariate normal distribution (see Appendix
Sec. S1 B). However, this  gaussian  approxi-
mation breaks down as degree distributions be-
comes heavier tailed. Overall, our statistical
model does a good job explaining most of the
empirical observations. Although the global de-
gree assortativity r is an important contributor
to the  majority illusion,  a more detailed view
of the structure using joint degree distribution
e(k, k ) is necessary to accurately estimate the
magnitude of the paradox. As demonstrated in
Appendix Sec. S1 C, two networks with the same
p(k) and r can display di erent amounts of the
paradox.
III. DISCUSSION
Local prevalence of some attribute among a
node s network neighbors can be very di erent
from its global prevalence, creating an illusion
that the attribute is far more common than it
actually is. In a social network, this illusion may
cause people to reach wrong conclusions about
how common a behavior is, leading them to ac-
cept as a norm a behavior that is globally rare.
This may explain how global outbreaks can be
triggered by very few initial adopters, and why
people overestimate how much their friends en-
gage in risky behaviors, such as alcohol and drug
use.
We quanti ed this paradox, which we call the
 majority illusion , and studied its dependence
on network structure and attribute con gura-
tion. As in the friendship paradox [13, 14, 19,
23],  majority illusion  can ultimately be traced
to the power of high degree nodes to skew the ob-
servations of many others. This is because such
nodes are overrepresented in the local neighbor-
hoods of other nodes. This, by itself is not sur-
prising, given than high degree nodes are ex-
pected to have more in uence and are often tar-
geted by in uence maximization algorithms [21].
However, the ability of high degree nodes to
bias the perceptions of others depends on other
aspects of network structure. Speci cally, we
showed that the paradox is much stronger in dis-
assortative networks, where high degree nodes
tend to link to low degree nodes. In other words,
given the same degree distribution, the high de-
gree nodes in a disassortative network will have
greater power to skew the observations of oth-
7
ers than those in an assortative network. This
suggests that some network structures are more
susceptible than others to in uence manipula-
tion and the spread of external shocks [32]. Fur-
thermore, small changes in network topology, as-
sortativity and degree attribute correlation may
further exacerbate the paradox even when there
are no actual changes in the distribution of the
attribute. This may explain the apparently sud-
den shifts in public attitudes witnessed during
the Arab Spring and on the question of gay mar-
riage.
The  majority illusion  is an example of class
size bias e ect. When sampling data to estimate
average class or event size, more popular classes
and events will be overrepresented in the sam-
ple, biasing estimates of their average size [15].
Thus, the average class size that students ex-
perience at college is larger than the college s
average class size. Similarly, people experience
highways, restaurants, and events to be more
crowded than they normally are. In networks,
sampling bias a ects estimates of network struc-
ture,
including its degree distribution [1, 18].
Our work suggests that network bias also af-
fects an individual s local perceptions and the
collective social phenomena that emerge.

cre-
ate a scale-free network with a speci ed degree
sequence. We generated a degree sequence from
a power law of the form p(k)   k  . Here, pk
is fraction of nodes that have k half-edges. The
con guration model proceeded by linking a pair
of randomly chosen half-edges to form an edge.
The linking procedure was repeated until all
half-edges have been used up or there were no
more ways to form an edge.
To create Erd os-R enyi-type networks, we
started with N = 10, 000 nodes and linked pairs
at random with some  xed probability. These
probabilities were  xed to produce average de-
gree similar to the average degree of the scale-
free networks.
The statistics of real-world networks we stud-

hki assortativity
A. Friendship Paradox
Node degree distribution p(k) gives the prob-
ability that a randomly chosen node in an undi-
rected network has k neighbors or edges. Neigh-
bor degree distribution q(k) gives the probabil-
ity that a randomly chosen edge in an undirected
network is connected to a node of degree k. It is
easy to demonstrate that average neighbor de-
gree hkiq is larger than average node degree hki.
The di erence between these quantities is
hkiq hki = Xk
k2p(k)
hki
 hki = (cid:10)k2(cid:11)   hki2
hki
=

k
hki
,
where  k is the standard deviation of the degree
distribution p(k). Since  k   0, hkiq   hki  
0. This con rms that the friendship paradox,
which says that average neighbor degree is larger
than node s own degree, has its origins in the
heterogeneous degree distribution [14], and is
more pronounced in networks with larger degree
heterogeneity  k.
Heterogeneous degree distribution also con-
tributes to nodes perceiving that their neigh-
bors have more of some attribute than they
themselves have   what is referred to as the
generalized friendship paradox [13]. Let s con-
sider again a network where nodes have a bi-
nary attribute x. For convenience, we will re-
fer to nodes with the attribute value x = 1
as active, and those with x = 0 as inactive.
The probability that a random node is active
probability that a random neighbor is active is
is P (x = 1) = Pk P (x = 1|k)p(k). The
Q(x = 1) = Pk P (x = 1|k)q(k). Using Bayes 
rule, this can be rewritten as
Q(x = 1) = Xk
= Xk
P (x = 1, k)

mating the joint distribution P (x , k ) as a mul-
tivariate normal distribution, and we have
hP (x |k )i = hP (x )i +  kx

(k    hki) ,
resulting in
P (x  = 1|k ) = hxi +  kx

Figure S1 reports the  majority illusion  in
the same synthetic scale free networks as Fig. 2,
but with theoretical lines (dashed lines) calcu-
lated using the Gaussian approximation for esti-
mating P (x  = 1|k ). The Gaussian approxima-
tion  ts results quite well for the network with
degree distribution exponent   = 3.1. However,
theoretical estimate deviates signi cantly from
data in a network with a heavier tailed degree
distribution with exponent   = 2.1. The ap-
proximation also deviate from the actual result
when the network has very positive or negative
assortativity. When this approximation is not
applicable, we need to determine the joint dis-
tribution P (x , k ) empirically to calculate both
 kx and P (x  = 1|k ) for a speci c joint distri-
bution.

where hkix=1 is the average degree of active
nodes. This quantity and the average degree
hki are related via the correlation coe cient
 kx = P (x=1)
[hkix=1   hki] (Eq. 1). Hence, the
strength of the generalized friendship paradox is

Q(x = 1)   P (x = 1) =  kx

,
which is positive when node degree and attribute
are positively correlated ( kx > 0) and increases
with this correlation [13].
B. Gaussian Approximation
The conditional probability P (x  = 1|k ) re-
quired to calculate the strength of the  major-
ity illusion  using Eq. 4 can be speci ed ana-
lytically for some  well-behaved  degree distri-
butions, such as scale free distributions of the
form p(k)   k   with   > 3 or the Poisson dis-
tributions of the Erd os-R enyi random graphs in
near-zero assortativity.
In these cases, proba-
bility P (x  = 1|k ) can be acquired by approxi-
A network is not fully speci ed by its degree
sequence and degree assortativity r.
In fact,
many di erent structures are possible with an
identical degree sequence and r. These struc-
tural di erence may a ect the  majority illu-
sion.  Here, we report some comparison of se-
lected degree sequences in scale-free synthetic
networks.
We generated scale-free networks with some
degree sequence and assortativity. We then
used edge rewiring to change network s structure
while keeping the assortativity r (and degree
sequence) the same. Existing structural con-
straints restrict the range of assortativity val-
ues that a given degree sequence may attain.
Thus there are fewer choices for extreme values
of assortativity. Figure S2 reports the fraction of
nodes in the paradox regime in these networks.
Identical symbols are for the same value of as-
sortativity. Results don t change much in cases
where structural constraints prevent varying the
structure while keeping assortativity  xed. On
the other hand, the fraction of nodes in the
paradox regime can vary somewhat in the mid-
assortativity range.
