Abstract. This paper presents a  nancial analysis over Twitter senti-
ment analytics extracted from listed retail brands. We investigate whether
there is statistically-signi cant information between the Twitter senti-
ment and volume, and stock returns and volatility. Traditional newswires
are also considered as a proxy for the market sentiment for comparative
purpose. The results suggest that social media is indeed a valuable source
in the analysis of the  nancial dynamics in the retail sector even when
compared to mainstream news such as the Wall Street Journal and Dow
Jones Newswires.
Keywords: retail,  nancial markets, data science, computational social

Introduction
Major news announcements can have a high impact on the  nancial market and
investor behaviour resulting in rapid changes or abnormal e ects in  nancial
portfolios. As human responsiveness is limited, automated news analysis has
been developed as a fundamental component to algorithmic trading. In this way,
traders can shorten the time of reaction in response to breaking stories. The basic
idea behind these news analytics technologies is to predict human behavior and
automate it, so traders may be able to anticipate asset movements before making
an investment or risk management decision.
Twitter data has also become an increasingly important source to describe
 nancial dynamics. It provides a  ne-grained real-time information channel that
includes not only major news stories but also minor events that, if properly
modelled, can provide ex-ante information about the market even before the
main newswires. Recent developments have re ected this prominent role of social
media in the  nancial markets. One major example is the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission report allowing companies to use Twitter to announce
key information in compliance with Regulation Fair Disclosure [18]. Twitter has
also shown that can cause fast and drastic impact. In 2013, with the so-called
Hash Crash, a hacked Twitter account of the American news agency Associated
Press falsely disclosed a message about an attack on the White House causing a
drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average of 145 points in minutes [25].
In [11] we proposed a new model for sentiment classi cation using Twitter.
We combined the traditional lexicon approach with a support vector machine al-
gorithm to achieve better predictive performance. In the present work, we use the
dataset of sentiment analytics from [11] to investigate the interplay between the
Twitter sentiment extracted from listed retail brands, and  nancial stock returns
and volatility. We verify whether there is statistically-signi cant information in
this relationship and also compare it to a corresponding analysis using sentiment
from traditional newswires. We consider volatility and log-returns as  nancial
endogenous variables and we take Twitter sentiment and volume as exogenous
explanatory variables in the  nancial dynamics of the selected stocks. We also
consider traditional newswires as datasource for comparative purpose. There-
fore, the main objectives are: (i) verify whether there is statistically-signi cant
information between the Twitter sentiment, and stock returns and volatility and
(ii) compare this interplay while using mainstream news as a proxy for the mar-
ket sentiment. The main contribution of this work is an empirical evidence that
supports the use of Twitter as a signi cant datasource in the context of  nancial
markets in the retail industry even when compared to traditional newswires.
2 Literature Review
The investigation of the market impact of News has been long studied since
the seminal work of [5]. In this work, the authors investigate to which extent
macroeconomic news explain return variance and also analyse the observed mar-
ket moves following major political and world events. More recently, [23] provided
the  rst evidence that news media content can predict movements in broad indi-
cators of stock market activity. The authors found correlation between high/low
pessimism of media and high market trading volume. They further analyse the
relation between the sentiment of news, earnings and return predictability [24].
Since then, with the availability of machine readable news and the use of senti-
ment analysis, several works have found news as a signi cant source for  nancial
applications: [1] found positive correlation between the number of mentions of
a company in the Financial Times and its stock s volume; [12] investigate the
e ect of News in the behavior of the traders; [13] analyse the Thomson Reuters
News Analytics (TRNA) and  nd a causality between sentiment and, volatility
and liquidity.
Recent research supports the hypothesis that Twitter data also has statistically-
signi cant information related to  nancial indicators. As one of the  rst investi-
gations analysing Twitter in the context of  nancial markets, [2] analyse the text
content of daily Twitter feeds to identify two types of mood: (i) polarity (positive
vs. negative) and (ii) emotions (calm, alert, sure, vital, kind, and happy). They
were able to increase the accuracy in the prediction of the DJIA index. Similar
work [27] was able to predict not only the DJIA index but also the NASDAQ-100
index; the authors measured the agreement of sentiment between messages in
addition to the market mood. More recently, [28] combined Information The-
ory with sentiment analysis to demonstrate that Twitter sentiment can contain
statistically-signi cant ex-ante information on future prices of the S&P500 index
and also identi ed a subset of securities in which hourly changes in social media
sentiment do provide lead-time information. As a contribution to the to the  eld
of event study research, [22] o er a methodology to analyse market reactions to
combinations of di erent types of news events using Twitter to identify which
news are more important from the investor perspective. In a similar way, [16]
combine sentiment analytics with the identi cation of Twitter peaks in an event
study approach to imply directions of market evolution. Further, exploring the
social network structure from Twitter users, [26] provide empirical evidence of a
 nancial community in Twitter in which users  interests align with the  nancial
market.
Similar to the present work, [21] investigate the causality between polarity
measures from Twitter and daily return of closing prices. The authors also use
sentiment derived from a Support Vector Machine model to classify the tweets
into the positive, negative and neutral categories. As a contribution compared to
this work we not only investigate the causality in returns but also stock s volatil-
ity. Also, we provide a comparison between Twitter and traditional newswires.
Moreover, we concentrate the analysis in retails brands which can provide mean-
ingful insights for applications in that domain.
Further examples of social media applications in the stock market are: the use
of StockTwits sentiment and posting volume to predict daily returns, volatility
and trading volume [14]; the extraction of features from  nancial message board
for stock market predictions [19] and approaches combining Twitter with other
sources such as blogs and news [27, 20, 4].
3 Dataset
Our analysis is conducted on a set of  ve listed retail brands with stocks traded
in the US equity market, which we monitor during the period from November
01, 2013 to September 30, 2014. The name of the investigated stocks with re-
spective Reuters Instrument Codes (RIC) follow: ABERCROMBIE & FITCH
CO. (ANF.N), NIKE INC. (NKE.N), HOME DEPOT INC. (HD.N), MATTEL
INC. (MAT.N) and GAMESTOP CORP. (GME.N). The choice of companies is
bounded by the Twitter sentiment analytics dataset provided by [11].
Given the companies selected, we consider three streams of time series data:
(i) the market data, which is given at the daily stock price; (ii) news meta-
data supplied by [17], which consists in 10,949 news stories from Dow Jones
Newswires, the Wall Street Journal and Barron s, and (iii) the social media data
analytics provided by [11], which is based on 42,803,225 Twitter messages.
3.1 News Analytics
The news analytics data supplied by [17] are provided in a metadata format
where each news receives scores quantifying characteristics such as relevance
and sentiment according to a related individual stock. Table 1 shows a sample
of the news sentiment analytics data provided. The relevance score (Relevance)
of the news ranges between 0 and 100 and indicates how strongly related the
company is to the underlying news story, with higher values indicating greater
relevance. Usually, a relevance value of at least 90 indicates that the entity is
referenced in the main title or headline of the news item, while lower values
indicate references further down the story body. Here we  lter the news stories
with a relevance of 100. This increases the likelihood of the story considered
being related to the underlying equity. Besides the relevance, we also consider
the Event Sentiment Score (ESS). This measure indicates short-term positive
or negative  nancial or economic impact of the news in the underlying company;
higher values indicate more positive impact. It ranges between 0 and 100 where
higher values indicate more positive sentiment while lower values below 50 show
negative sentiment.

to a company. The metadata considered consists of the relevance and sentiment
scores and a timestamp.

volume analytics for each company as:
Given this metadata information, we  rst normalize the Event Sentiment
Score (ESS) of a given story at a timestamp  t such as it ranges between -1
and 1, and we label it as (cid:100)ESS( t)   [ 1, 1]. Then, we de ne the sentiment and

  BN ews(t): daily number of negative News, i.e., daily total number of News
  GN ews(t): daily number of positive News, i.e., daily total number of News
  VN ews(t): daily total number of News;
  SAN ews(t): daily absolute sentiment from News:
SAN ews(t) = GN ews(t)   BN ews(t);
(1)
  SRN ews(t)   [ 1, 1]: daily relative sentiment from News as the daily mean
of sentiment score (cid:100)ESS( t),  t   [t, t + 1).
3.2 Twitter Analytics
For the Twitter data analytics, we use the dataset from [11]. It provides senti-
ment and volume metrics related to a company. We use the following analytics:
  GT witter(t): daily number of positive English tweets;
  BT witter(t): daily number of negative English tweets;
  VT witter(t): daily total number of messages regardless of the language.
Table 2 shows an example of the Twitter sentiment analytics for the company
MATTEL INC. For the polarity classi cation, [11] employed a new approach
based on the combination of existing common used techniques (lexicon-based
and machine learning based) which outperformed standard benchmarks, see [11]
for further details. Notice that the number of positive, negative and neutral
messages do not sum up to the total volume, as the former consider only English
tweets and the total volume covers the total number of messages regardless of
the language. Also, although provided, we do not use the number of neutral
messages as we believe that the extreme polarities (positive and negative) may
be more informative.
Table 2: Twitter Sentiment Analytics. Sample of analytics for the company MAT-
TEL INC. It shows the positive, negative and neutral English Twitter messages
related to the company and also the total number of messages regardless of the
language.

We hence compute the variables:
  SAT witter(t): daily absolute sentiment from Twitter:
SAT witter(t) = GT witter(t)   BT witter(t);
  SRT witter(t)   [ 1, 1]: daily relative sentiment from Twitter as
SRT witter(t) =
GT witter(t)   BT witter(t)
GT witter(t) + BT witter(t)
.
(2)
(3)
Notice that SRT witter(t0) = +1, represents a day t0 with the highest posi-
tive sentiment for the company considered; conversely SRT witter(t0) =  1 in-
dicates the highest negative sentiment, whereas we consider neutrality when
SRT witter(t0) = 0.
Although Twitter and News are distinct datasources, noticed that we have
computed sentiment and volume analytics in such way that we have comparable
time series between those sources3. This allows us make a comparative study
between them while analysing the  nancial data further de ned.
Table 3 shows a summary description of the selected companies with the
number of stories considered. We show the total number of News related to the
each company and also the number of relevant news, i.e., those in which the news
story has a Relevance score equals to 100, as explained previously. Moreover,
we present the total number of tweets related to each company. Notice that the
Twitter dataset used does not provide any relevance score, therefore there is no
further  ltering process.
Table 3: Summary table of selected companies. The  ve retails brands selected
for the analysis along with their market capitalization. Also, we present the total
number of news and tweets in the selected period. The relevant news represent

3 We may refer to a time series independently to a speci c datasource, in such cases
we will represent it as its original symbol but without the text subscript, e.g., the
number of positive will be represented as G(t) when discussing both News GN ews(t)
and Twitter GT witter(t) in the same context.
4 Financial Variables
Let P (t) be the closing price of an asset at day t and R(t) = log P (t) log P (t   1)
its daily log-return. We consider the Excess of Log-return4 of the asset over the
return of the market index (cid:98)R as:
We consider the S&P500 daily returns as the market index (cid:98)R.
ER(t) = R(t)   (cid:98)R(t).
(4)
(5)
As a proxy for the daily volatility of a stock, we de ne:
V OL(t) = 2
Phigh(t)   Plow(t)
Phigh(t) + Plow(t)
,
where Phigh(t) and Plow(t) are the highest and the lowest price of the stock at
day t, respectively.
Fig. 1 shows a sample of the calculated variables from Twitter for the com-
pany Home-Depot Inc. It is interesting to notice a spike in volume and decrease
in sentiment at the end of the period which follows a corresponding drop in
excess of log-return. Further, Fig. 2 depicts the distribution of values of the rel-
ative sentiment obtained from Twitter and News. We observe that both present
a skewed distribution while news has a more neutral-centred distribution com-
pared to Twitter. It is important to notice that the sentiment provided by the
Twitter analytics presents a distinct proxy for sentiment compared to News as
each company analysed depicts di erent positive/negative sentiment tones, e.g.,
the NIKE s Twitter sentiment is highly positive while the news  sentiment has
a mean around a neutral point.
4 An alternative approach is to examine the alpha generation as the excess return of
the underlying stock relative to its benchmark adjusted for a given level of risk as
in the market model described in [8].
Fig. 1: Twitter s Sample Descriptive Analysis for Home-Depot Inc. Variables:
Excess of log-return, ER; volatility, V OL; absolute sentiment, SAT witter; num-
ber of positive messages, GT witter and number of negative messages, BT witter.
There is a spike in volume and decrease in sentiment at the end of the period
which follows a corresponding drop in excess of log-return.
Fig. 2: Distribution of relative sentiment from Twitter SRT witter(t) and News
SRN ews(t) for the companies: ABERCROMBIE & FITCH CO., GAMESTOP
CORP., HOME DEPOT INC., MATTEL INC. and NIKE INC. It is clear that
the sentiment provided by Twitter is a distinct proxy for market sentiment com-
pared to News as each company analysed depicts di erent distributions of sen-
timent.
5 Method
5.1 Granger Causality
We are interested in investigating the statistical causality between sentiment
and the  nancial variables. In this sense, [9] introduced a concept of cause-e ect
dependence where the cause not only should occur before the e ect but also
should contain unique information about the e ect. Therefore, we say that X
Granger-cause Y if the prediction of Y can be improved using both information
from X and Y as compared to only utilizing Y.
In a Vector Auto-Regressive (VAR) framework, we can assess the Granger
causality performing a F-test to verify the null hypothesis that Y is not Granger-
caused by X and measure its probability of rejection within a con dence level.
Hence, assuming the VAR models:
Yt =  0 +  1Yt 1 + . . . +  kYt k +  1Xt 1 + . . . +  kXt k + t,
Xt =  0 +  1Xt 1 + . . . +  kXt k +  1Yt 1 + . . . +  kYt k +(cid:98)t,
(6)
(7)
we take the null hypothesis in equation (8) and test it against its alternative
one in equation (9). Thus, a rejection of the null hypothesis implies that Y
Granger-cause X.
H0 :  1 =  2 = . . . =  k = 0
H1 :     , 0       k :    (cid:54)= 0
(8)
(9)
In the same way, the test for X Granger-cause Y can be done considering the
equation (7) and taking the hypotheses from equations (8) and (9) in an analo-
gous way.
For both News and Twitter, we will test the Grange-causality between the
Excess of Log-return ER and the number of positive stories G, the number
of negative stories B, the relative sentiment SR and the absolute sentiment
SA. For the volatility V OL, we will consider the total volume of stories V in
addition to previously mentioned variables. Furthermore, we will perform the
Granger-causality test over the normally standardized versions of the time series
analysed such as they have zero mean and standard deviation 1. To perform the
F-statistics of the Granger-causality tests we use the function anova.lm from the
package stats of the R Project for Statistical Computing [15].
For the only purpose of visualization of the Granger-causality results we
create a Granger-causality graph G = [V, E], where V is a node set, and E is an
edge set. A node u   V represents a variable in the causality test and an edge
e = (u, v) indicates that u Granger-causes v within a pre-de ned signi cance
level. Further, we de ne p(e) as an attribute of the edge and if C is the set of
companies in which we have a causality between u and v, then we set p(e) = C.
Fig. 3 shows an example of a Granger-causality graph that indicates that u
Granger-causes v for the set of companies C.

5.2 Predictive Analysis
To evaluate the predictive power of sentiment we consider two auto-regressive
models, with and without sentiment, and conduct a 1-step ahead prediction
analysis:
k(cid:88)
k(cid:88)
  =1
M0 : X(t) =   +
M1 : X(t) =   +
   X(t     ) + t,
   X(t     ) +
k(cid:88)
 iY (t     ) +(cid:98)t
(10)
(11)
(12)
(13)
where,
  =1
i=1
X(t)   {ER(t), V OL(t)},
Y (t)   {G(t), B(t), SR(t), V (t)}.
As the absolute sentiment SA(t) (of both News and Twitter) is already a linear
combination between positive G(t) and negative stories B(t), we will not consider
it in the linear regression for any dataset. Moreover, we consider only 1 day lag
for the sentiment variables and a lag of 2 days for the  nancial variables5. Again,
we will consider the normally standardized versions of the time series analysed.
Hence, we will consider the following regression models for the excess of log-
return prediction:
M0 : ER(t) =   +  1ER(t   1) +  2ER(t   2) + t,
M1 : ER(t) =   +  1ER(t   1) +  2ER(t   2)
+  1G(t   1) +  2B(t   1) +  3SR(t   1) +(cid:98)t
(14)
(15)
For the volatility prediction using news as datasource we will not include the
volume time series VN ews(t) as an explanatory variable in the regression because
of its high correlation with the number of positive and negative news already
taken into account in the model. Notice that, for the Twitter case, the volume
time series consider also non-English messages which are not taken into account
by the time series in GT witter(t) and BT witter(t). Therefore, we keep VT witter(t)
5 A model selection approach can be also used in order to  nd an optimal lag for the
explanatory variables, examples of selection s criteria are: the Akaike information
criterion (AIC), the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) and Mallow s Cp. See [3].

as an explanatory variable in the Twitter model. As a result, we have for news:

M1 : V OL(t) =   +  1V OL(t   1) +  2V OL(t   2)

and for Twitter:

M1 : V OL(t) =   +  1V OL(t   1) +  2V OL(t   2)

6 Results and Discussion
Here we present the results from the Granger-causality tests and the predic-
tive analysis between the  nancial variables and sentiment data from Twitter
and news. The sentiment predictive power and its Granger-causality tests are
ful lled in 1-step ahead fashion. We investigate the statistical signi cance of
the sentiment variables in regards to movements in returns and volatility and
we compare the Twitter results with news. We provide empirical evidence that
Twitter is moving the market in respect to the excess of log-returns for a subset
of stocks. Also, Twitter presents a stronger relationship with stock returns com-
pared to news, in the selected retail companies. On the other hand, the Twitter
sentiment analytics showed a weaker relationship with volatility compared to
news.
6.1 Excess of Log-Returns
We analyse the dynamics of excess of log-returns of the stocks considered in
relation to absolute and relative sentiments and also with the number of positive
and negative stories.
Fig. 4 shows the Granger-causality graph that summarises the signi cant
Granger-causalities (p-value < 0.05) between the excess of log-return and the
sentiment variables for both news and Twitter. See Table 5 for the detailed
results. We observe that the Twitter s sentiment analytics present more signi -
cant points compared to news. The Twitter s relative sentiment and its number
of positive messages Granger-cause log-returns, respectively, for the companies
GAMESTOP CORP. and MATTEL INC. The Twitter s absolute sentiment also
Granger-causes returns for MATTEL INC. while having a two-way signi cant
(p-value < 0.01) Granger-causality for the company HOME DEPOT INC. The
number of negative stories alone has no signi cant relationship with returns but
combined with the number of positive stories in the form of relative and absolute
sentiment it shows to be an important measure. The News  analytics have only
one signi cant relationship that it is observed in the number of positive news
Granger-causing the excess of log-returns for the company GAMESTOP CORP.

Fig. 4: Granger-causality graph for (a) Twitter and (b) news. It shows the signi -
cant points in the the Granger-causality test between excess of log-returns (ER)
and the sentiment analytics: number of positive stories (G), number of nega-
tive stories (B), absolute sentiment (SA) and relative sentiment SR. Sentiment
variables that presented no signi cant causality are not shown in the graph.
The solution of the multiple regression analysis in Table 6 agrees with the
Granger-causality tests as it shows Twitter with a higher number of signi cant
sentiment coe cients compared to news. The company MATTEL INC. partic-
ularly presents all sentiment coe cients with high signi cance (p-value < 0.01)
suggesting that the Twitter sentiment analytics is indeed relevant in the pre-
diction of the next day excess of log-return. The companies HOME DEPOT
INC. and GAMESTOP CORP. also presented signi cant sentiment coe cients.
For the News analytics, the sentiment was signi cant only for the company
GAMESTOP CORP. Further, analysis of the Residual Standard Error of the
models with and without sentiment variables in Table 4 shows that the use of
the Twitter sentiment variables reduced the error of the model with only market
data for the companies MATTEL INC., HOME DEPOT INC. and GAMESTOP
CORP. while the news  sentiment improved the prediction only for the company
GAMESTOP CORP.
In sum, the Twitter analytics surprisingly showed a stronger causality with
stock s returns compared to news. It is interesting to notice that we did not
perform any explicit  ltering process in the Twitter analytics. However, we only
considered the extremes of polarity (positive and negative categories), i.e., we did
not consider the neutral tweets. This suggests that the sentiment classi cation
itself is indirectly  ltering the noise in the data in the sense that the non-neutral
tweets are really informative. Moreover, the increased causality compared to
news indicates a prominent role of Twitter in the retail industry. We believe
that Twitter act as a feedback channel for the retail brands in a timely fashion
 ne-grained way compared to News.

ket data.

6.2 Volatility
Here, we analyse the interplay between message s volume and sentiment with
stock s volatility. As volume measures we consider: the number of positive and
negative English stories and also the total volume of stories, regardless of the
language. As sentiment analytics we consider: absolute sentiment and relative
sentiment.
Fig. 5 shows the signi cant links (p-value < 0.05) of the Granger-causality
test between the volatility and the sentiment variables. See Table 8 for the de-
tailed results. Overall, there are more signi cant points of causality for the News
sentiment analytics compared to Twitter. We observe that the number of positive
stories and the total volume both Granger-cause volatility for Twitter as well
as for news but more companies are a ected by news. The absolute sentiment
Granger-causes volatility only for news, observed in the company ABERCROM-
BIE & FITCH CO. (ANF.N). The relative sentiment and the number of negative
stories are not causing volatility, on the other hand volatility is Granger-causing
negative news for the company GAMESTOP CORP. (GME.N).

Fig. 5: Granger-causality graph for (a) Twitter and (b) news. It shows the sig-
ni cant points in the Granger-causality test between volatility (V OL) and the
sentiment analytics: total number of stories (V ), number of positive stories (G),
number of negative stories (B), absolute sentiment (SA) and relative sentiment
(SR). Sentiment variables with no signi cant causality are not shown in the
graph.
The solution of the multiple regression analysis in Table 9 shows that the
number of positive stories is a signi cant variable for both news and Twitter,
being more signi cant for the former. The number of negative stories showed
no relevance in both regressions. The total volume of Twitter was relevant only
for the company NKE.N. Moreover, analysis of the Residual Standard Error of
the models with and without sentiment variables in Table 7 shows that both
Twitter and News were able to reduce the error in prediction for a subset of the
companies. In the cases where the model was improved with sentiment, News
provided a higher reduction of error compared to Twitter.
Overall, the news analytics showed a higher causality with volatility com-
pared to Twitter. This con rms the predictive power of News with volatility as
described in the literature [7, 13, 6, 10]. Further improvements in entity detec-
tion in the sentiment classi cation algorithm used in the dataset provided [11]
may improve the Twitter s results.

V OL(t) using G(t), B(t) and V (t) compared to the model with only market
data.

7 Conclusion
We showed that measures of the Twitter sentiment extracted from listed retail
brands have statistically-signi cant relationship with stock returns and volatility.
While analysing the interplay between the excess of log-return and the Twitter
sentiment variables we conclude that: (i) Twitter presented a stronger Granger-
causality with stock s returns compared to news; (ii) positive tweets and Twit-
ter s sentiment Granger-cause excess of log-returns for a subset of companies;
(iii) Twitter s sentiment analytics is indeed relevant in the prediction of the next
day excess of log-return even compared to traditional newswires. Moreover, in
the volatility analysis we found that: (i) Twitter s analytics showed a weaker
relationship with volatility compared to the one observed with returns; (ii) the
number of positive tweets and the total volume both Granger-cause volatility for
some companies but present reduced Granger-causality compared to news; (iii)
the number of positive tweets is a signi cant variable for the 1-step ahead pre-
diction of volatility while the number of negative messages showed no relevance.
Overall, the Twitter sentiment analytics showed to be a distinct and comple-
mentary proxy of market s sentiment compared to news in the analysis of the
 nancial dynamics of retail brands  stocks. Surprisingly, the Twitter s sentiment
presented a relatively stronger relationship with the stock s returns compared
to traditional newswires. The results suggest that social media analytics have a
prominent role in the dynamics of the retails sector in the  nancial markets.
