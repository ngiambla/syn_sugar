(Dated: January 11, 2017)
We propose and develop a Lexicocalorimeter: an online, interactive instrument for measuring the
 caloric content  of social media and other large-scale texts. We do so by constructing extensive yet
improvable tables of food and activity related phrases, and respectively assigning them with sourced
estimates of caloric intake and expenditure. We show that for Twitter, our naive measures of  caloric
input ,  caloric output , and the ratio of these measures are all strong correlates with health and
well-being measures for the contiguous United States. Our caloric balance measure in many cases
outperforms both its constituent quantities; is tunable to speci c health and well-being measures
such as diabetes rates; has the capability of providing a real-time signal re ecting a population s
health; and has the potential to be used alongside traditional survey data in the development of
public policy and collective self-awareness. Because our Lexicocalorimeter is a linear superposition of
principled phrase scores, we also show we can move beyond correlations to explore what people talk
about in collective detail, and assist in the understanding and explanation of how population-scale
conditions vary, a capacity unavailable to black-box type methods.
I.
INTRODUCTION
Online instruments designed to measure social, psycho-
logical, and physical well-being at a population level are
becoming essential for public policy purposes and public
health monitoring [1, 2]. These data-centric gauges both
empower the general public with information to allow
comparisons of communities at all scales, and natural-
ly complement the broad, established set of more read-
ily measurable socioeconomic indicators such as wage
growth, crime rates, and housing prices.
Overall well-being, or quality of
life, depends on
many factors and is complex to measure [3]. Existing
techniques for estimating population well-being range
from traditional surveys [1, 4] to estimates of smile-to-
frown ratios captured automatically on camera in pub-
lic spaces [5], and vary widely in the types of data they
amass, collection methods, cost, time scales involved, and
degree of intrusion. Partly in response to policy makers 
desire for simple  one number  quanti cation of complex
systems arguably a general human proclivity many
measures are composite in nature. Two examples are (1)

Typeset by REVTEX
the Gallup Well-Being Index, which is based on factors
such as life evaluation, emotional health, physical health,
healthy behavior, work environment, and basic access to
necessary resources [4]; and (2) the Living Conditions
measure developed by the United States Census Bureau,
which is derived from housing conditions, neighborhood
conditions, basic needs met, a  full set  of appliances,
and access to help if needed [6].
While such measures will always have their place, we
venture that we must resist oversimpli cation. The dash-
board of society should be just that a rich set of incom-
patible instruments whose informational content may be
observed individually and in total, not unlike the required
input needed for  ying a plane where knowledge of just a
single number representing  things are going well  would
be untenable. The construction of data-centric instru-
ments for social systems that deliver more direct, inter-
pretable measures is therefore of great importance as we
move forward into the age of ubiquitous (but not com-
plete) measurement.
With the explosive growth of online activity and social
media around the world, the massive amount of real-
time data created directly by populations of interest has
become an increasingly attractive and fruitful source for
analysis. Despite the limitation that social media users
in the United States are not a random sample of the US
population [7], there is a wealth of information in these
data sets and uneven sampling can often be accommo-
dated.
2
Indeed, online activity is now considered by many
to be a promising data source for detecting health
conditions [8, 9] and gathering public-health informa-
tion [10, 11], and within the last decade, researchers have
constructed a range of online public-health instruments
with varying degrees of success. The maturing of these
and related instruments along with theoretical models
will ultimately fundamentally inform the limits of char-
acterization and predictability of social systems.
In the next two subsections, we cover related research
and then describe our approach to measuring the  caloric
content  of text.
A. Previous work
For a general overview of work relevant to our present
e ort, we brie y summarize related research concerning
public health and well-being in connection with a range
of social media and online data sets.
In the di cult realm of predicting pandemics [12],
Google Flu Trends [13] enjoyed early success and acclaim.
Initially based very simply on search terms, the instru-
ment proved unsurprisingly to be imperfect and in need
of a more sophisticated approach [14].
In work by several of the current authors and col-
leagues, Mitchell et al. measured the happiness of tweets
across the US and found strong correlations with other
indices of well-being at city and state level, such as the
Gallup Well-being Index; the Peace Index; the America s
Health Ranking composite index of Behavior, Commu-
nity and Environment, Policy and Clinical Care metrics;
and gun violence (negative correlation) [15]. Using the
same instrument in 10 languages, the Hedonometer, we
have also shown that the emotional content of tweets
tracks major world events [2, 16].
Paul and Dredze found that states with higher obe-
sity rates have more tweets about obesity, and states
with higher smoking rates have more tweets about can-
cer [11]. They also found a negative correlation between
exercise and frequency of tweeting about ailments, sug-
gesting  Twitter users are less likely to become sick in
states where people exercise.  They further found health
care coverage rates to be negatively correlated with like-
lihood of posting tweets about diseases.
Chunara et al. recently found that activity-related
interests on Facebook are negatively correlated with
being overweight and obese, while interest in television
is positively correlated with the same [17].
In an analysis of online recipe queries, West et al.
found that the number of patients admitted to the emer-
gency room of a major urban hospital in Washington,
DC for congestive heart failure (CHF) each month was
signi cantly correlated with average sodium per recipe
searched for on the Web in the same month [18].
Eichstaedt and colleagues [19] have demonstrated that
psychological language on Twitter outperforms certain
composite socioeconomic indices in predicting heart dis-
ease at the county level. They were able to show in par-
ticular that the expression of negative emotions such as
anger on Twitter could be taken as a kind of risk factor
at the population scale.
On a US county level, Culotta [20] found that Twitter
activity provided a more   ne-grained representation 
of community health than demographics alone with the
prevalance of particular words that indicate, for example,
television habits, or negative engagement.
Finally, in work directly related to our present study,
Abbar et al. [21] have recently performed a similar analy-
sis of translating food terms used on Twitter into calories.
They found a correlation between Twitter calories and
obesity and diabetes rates for the US, and explored how
food-themed interactions over social networks vary with
connectedness,  nding suggestions of social contagion.
While our approach and results are largely sympathet-
ic, our work incorporates estimates of physical activity
which we will show provides essential extra information
regarding health; introduces a phrase extraction method
we call serial partitioning; and leads to an online imple-
mentation, paving the way for a real-time instrument as
part of our proposed  panometer.  We also note that we
carried out our work concurrently and independently.
B. Lexicocalometrics
From the preceding list of studies, it has become clear
that we can estimate population-scale levels of health and
well-being through social media. Here, we examine the
words and phrases people post publicly about food and
physical activity on Twitter on a statewide level for the
contiguous United States (48 states along with the Dis-
trict of Columbia). As we explain fully below in Sec. II A
and Methods and Materials, Sec. IV, we group categori-
cally similar words and phrases into lemmas, and we then
assign caloric values to these lemmas using the terms and
notation  caloric input  for food, Cin, and  caloric out-
put  for activity, Cout. We de ne the ratio of caloric
output to caloric input to be a third quantity,  caloric
ratio :
Crat =
Cout
Cin
.
(1)
While we will focus largely on the three quantities Cin,
Cout, and Crat, we will also explore  caloric di erence ,
an alternate combination of Cin and Cout involving a sin-
gle parameter:
Cdi ( ) =  Cout   (1    )Cin,
(2)
where 0       1. We use  phrase shifts  [2] to show
how speci c lemmas e.g.,  apples ,  cake with frost-
ing ,  white water rafting ,  knitting , and  watching
tv or movie  contribute to the caloric texture of states
across the contiguous US. We then correlate all three val-
ues with 37 measures relating to health and well-being,
and we  nd statistically strong correlations with quan-
tities such as high blood pressure, inactivity, diabetes
levels, and obesity rates. For ease of language, we will
generally speak of phrases rather than lemmas.
We have also generated an accompanying online, inter-
active instrument for exploring health patterns through
the lens of  Twitter calories : the Lexicocalorimeter. An
initial,  xed version of the instrument may be accessed at
this paper s Online Appendices, http://compstorylab.
org/share/papers/alajajian2015a/, with a evolv-
able, production version housed within our larger mea-
surement platform http://panometer.org at http://
panometer.org/instruments/lexicocalorimeter (all
code for these sites can be found at https://github.
com/andyreagan/lexicocalorimeter-appendix). We
note that while our online instrument is based on Twit-
ter, it may in principle be used on any su ciently large
text source, social media or otherwise, such as Facebook.
From this point, we structure the core of our paper as
follows. In Sec. II, we establish and discuss our  ndings
in depth. Speci cally, we: (1) Outline our text analysis
of a Twitter corpus from 2011 2012 Sec. II A), reserving
full details for Methods and Materials in Sec. IV;
(2)
Present caloric maps of the contiguous US contrasting
the 48 states and DC through histograms and phrase
shifts (Sec. II B); and (3) Examine how Cin, Cin, Crat,
and Cdi ( ) correlate with a suite of measures relating
to health and well-being. In the Supporting Information,
we provide a sample of con rmatory  gures as well as all
shareable data sets (e.g., IDs for all tweets). We o er
concluding thoughts in Sec. III.
II. ANALYSIS AND RESULTS
A. Estimating calories from phrases
We used all available geotagged tweets from 2011 and
2012 (around 50 million) from a bounding box of the con-
tiguous US, using Twitter s garden hose sample (which
is a sample of approximately 10% of all tweets, including
those that are not geotagged) and the geotag feature to
determine from which of the 48 continental states and
the District of Columbia each tweet came. From this
sample, we counted the total number of times each food
and physical activity phrase in our database was tweeted
about in each of the 48 continental states and the District
of Columbia (see Sec. IV and Dataset S1 at https://
dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.4530965.v1 for all
tweet IDs). We then used these counts to determine the
average caloric input Cin from food phrase tweets and the
average caloric output Cout from physical activity phrase
tweets as follows.
First, we equate each food phrase s with the calories
per 100 grams of that food, using the notation Cin(s).
(We also explored serving sizes but the databases avail-
able proved far from complete.) We then compute the
(cid:80)
caloric input for a given text T as:
(cid:80)
Cin(s)f (s| T )
s f (s| T )
Cin(T ) =
s Sin
=
3
(cid:88)
s Sin
Cin(s)p(s| T ),
(3)
where f (s| T ) is the frequency of phrase s in text T ,
p(s| T ) is the normalized version, and Sin is the set of
all food phrases in our database.
Second, for each tweeted physical activity phrase, we
use an estimate of the Metabolic Equivalent of Tasks, or
METs, which we then converted to calories expended per
hour, assuming a weight of 80.7 kilograms, the average
weight of a North American adult [22]. Analogous to
Cin(T ) above, we then have
Cout(T ) =
Cout(s)p(s| T ),
(4)
(cid:88)
s Sout
where now Sout is the set of all phrases in our activity
database.
We emphasize that both our food and exercise phrase
data sets and Twitter databases are necessarily incom-
plete in nature. The values of Cin and Cout are thus not
meaningful as absolute numbers but rather have power
for comparisons. We also acknowledge that our equiva-
lences are crude e.g., each mention of a speci c food is
naively turned into the calories associated with 100 grams
of that food and later on we address our choices in more
depth. Nevertheless, our method is pragmatic yet as we
will show e ective, and o ers clear directions for future
improvement.
For simplicity and ultimately because the results are
su ciently strong, we did not  lter tweets beyond their
geographic location. Tweets may thus come from indi-
viduals, restaurants, sports stores, resorts, news outlets,
marketers,  tness apps, tourists, and so on, and fur-
ther improvements and re nements may be achieved by
appropriately constraining the Twitter corpus.
Finally, we take the ratio of Cout(T ) to Cin(T ) to
obtain the text s caloric ratio Crat(T ).
In general, we
observe that a higher value of Crat(T ) at the population
scale would appear to be intuitively better, up to some
limit indicating negative energy balance. We note that
Crat = 1 is not salient and should not be taken to mean
a population is  balanced calorically . As we discuss lat-
er, using the di erence, what we call Caloric Di erence,
a generalization of Cout   Cin, generates similar results
but, from a framing perspective, we have reservations in
creating a scale with a 0 point given the approximate
nature of our measures.
B. Caloric maps of the contiguous US
We now move to our central analysis and exploration of
how our lexicocalorimetric measure varies geographically.
We start with visual representations and then continue
on to more detailed comparisons.

FIG. 1.
Choropleth maps indicating (A) caloric input Cin and (B) caloric output Cout in the contiguous United States
(including the District of Columbia) based on 50 million geotagged tweets taken from 2011 2012. For both maps, darker means
higher values as per the color bars on the right. The histograms in Figs. 5, S2, and S3 show the speci c rankings according
to these two variables and also Crat (see Fig. 3). The overlaid phrase lemmas are the most dominant contributors to Cin and
Cout almost universally  pizza  and  watching tv or movie .
In Fig. 1, we show two choropleth maps of our overall
2011 2012 measures of Twitter s caloric input Cin and
caloric output Cout. For both maps and those that fol-
low, quantities increase as colors move from light to dark
green.
These maps immediately allow for some basic obser-
vations which we will delve into and harden up as our
analysis proceeds. For the food calories map, we see Cin

FIG. 2. The same choropleth maps for Cin and Cout presented Fig. 1 but now with phrases whose increased usage contribute
the most to a population s Cin and Cout di ering from the overall averages of these measures. See Sec. II D. For example, tweets
from Vermont, which was above average for both Cin and Cout for 2011 2012, disproportionately contain  bacon  and  skiing .
Michigan was above average for Cin and below for Cout in 2011 2012, and the most distinguishing phrases are  chocolate
candy  and  laying down . See Figs. 5, S2, and S3 for ordered rankings.
is generally largest in the Midwest and the south while
Colorado and Maine stand out as states with the lowest
calories.
We see a di erent texture in the activity calories map
with the highest caloric output according to our measure
appearing in the three-state block of Wyoming, Colorado,
and Utah, as well as Vermont. Tweet-based caloric out-
put drops to a low in Mississippi and the surrounding
6
states, while Michigan also appears to have a low value
of Cout.
For the food and activities maps in Fig. 1, we also
show the most dominant phrase for each population s Cin
and Cout scores. Almost uniformly,  pizza  (high calorie
food) and  watching tv or movie  (low calorie activity)
are the lemmas with the largest contributions, a func-
tion of both volume and caloric scores. Only Mississippi
( ice cream ) and Wyoming ( cookies ) are exceptions,
though  pizza  is still near the top for both.
In Fig. 2, we present the same choropleth maps
from Fig. 1, but now with the phrase most distinguish-
ing a population. Speci cally, we show phrases whose
increased prevalence most contributes to moving a popu-
lation s Twitter calorie scores away from the overall aver-
age for the contiguous US. For example, if a population s
Cin is above average, we  nd the food phrase whose fre-
quency coupled with its caloric content most strongly
moves the population s Cin up from the average.
(We
explain in full how we determine these phrases later with
phrase shifts in Sec. II D.) We now see a diverse spread of
terms. We  nd a number of phrases make for reasonable
representations:
   lobster  in Maine and Massachusetts;
   grits  in Georgia;
   skiing  in Vermont, New Hampshire, and Utah;
  and  running  in Colorado and a number of other
locations.
Prototypical unhealthy foods rise to the top in various
states:
   donuts  in Texas;
   cake  in Mississippi;
   chocolate candy  in Louisiana;
  and  cookies  in Indiana.
By contrast, a few  virtuous  foodstu s appear such as
 green beans  in Oregon and  tomato  in California.
Our activity list also includes some rather low intensity
ones and we see:
   eating  rising to the top in Texas, the south, and
a number other states;
   watching tv or movie  in Pennsylvania and else-
where;
   sitting  in Tennessee;
   talking on the phone  in Delaware;
   getting my nails done  in New Jersey;
  and simply  lying down  in Michigan.
FIG. 3. Choropleth for caloric ratio Crat = Cout/Cin. See
Figs. 5, S2, and S3 for ordered rankings.
Now, we do not pretend that these phrases all come
from individuals diligently recording their present meals
or activities. Apart from tweets from individuals, our
database contains tweets from companies, advertisers,
resorts, and so on. And some phrases are problemat-
ic in their generality of meaning, most especially  run-
ning  (the word  run  currently has the most meanings
in the Oxford English Dictionary). Nevertheless, as we
dig deeper into all the phrases found for a particular
state, we will continue to  nd commonsensical lexical
patterns.
In Fig. 3, we show a choropleth map for caloric ratio,
Crat. We see that the highest values of Crat are found in
Colorado, Wyoming, and Vermont, and secondarily for
Maine, Minnesota, Oregon, and Utah. Low values of Crat
appear in the region comprising Mississippi, Louisiana,
Alabama, and Arkansas, as well as West Virginia.
An initial visual comparison of of Figs. 1 and 3, sug-
gest that Cout is more well aligned with Crat than Cin.
The reason is that for the present version of the Lexic-
ocalorimeter, Cout has a larger dynamic range than Cin,
roughly 250 to 285 versus 160 to 210 giving ratios of
250 (cid:39) 1.14. We could assert that Cin is
160 (cid:39) 1.31 and 285
210
fundamentally less informative but:
1. In Sec. II E, we will  nd that some measures relat-
ing to health and well-being correlate more strongly
with Cin and some with Cout;
2. We may adjust the dynamic range of either measure
by rescaling, introducing a kind of tunability [2] to
the instrument (a feature we will reserve for future
iterations); and
3. Because our food phrase database is a factor of 10
smaller than our activity phrase one, revisions of
our instrument may elevate the power of Cin.
To provide some support for point 1, we compare Cout
and Cin in Fig. 4 (see also Fig. S1).
Importantly, we
see that the two measures are indeed not well correlat-
ed, indicating they contain di erent kinds of informa-
tion (Pearson correlation coe cient   p (cid:39) 0.13, p-value
7
all bars are relative to the overall average of the speci c
measure. Numeric rankings for each measure are given
next to each bar. In Figs. S2 and S3, we present the same
histograms re-sorted respectively by Cin and Cout.
As was indicated by our inspection the choropleth
maps, we do indeed see that Crat is more strongly driv-
en by Cout than Cin due to the former s larger dynamic
range. The states with the highest values of Crat achieve
their scores through high levels of Cout but more vari-
able levels of Cin. Wyoming (23), Vermont (21), and
Utah (25) are all middling in Cin while Colorado (48)
and Maine (49) have the lowest ranks for caloric intake.
At the trailing end, we see by contrast that low activity
ranks are coupled with high ranks for caloric intake.
A few of the more anomalous states are both evident
in the Cin and Cout histograms and as those appearing
farthest away from the best line of  t in the scatter plot
of Fig. 4. South Dakota has both high values of Cin and
Cout (ranks of 1 and 7) that arrange to give it a ranking
of 25 for Crat. Maryland ranking 42nd and 45th in Cin
and Cout, is the only state in the  bottom  10 of both
measures.
D. Phrase shifts
In our work on measuring happiness, we have devel-
oped and extensively used  word shifts  to show which
words make a given text appear more positive than
another text in aggregate (see [2] and [16]). Such visu-
alizations not only provide our necessary test, but also
allow us to draw insight from the lexical tapestry of
texts. Here, we will explain and use analogously con-
structed phrase shifts for both Cin and Cout to examine
the states at the extremes of our Crat rankings, Col-
orado and Mississippi.
Interactive food and activity
phrase shifts for the 49 regions of the contiguous US form
a central part of our online Lexicocalorimeter: http:
//panometer.org/instruments/lexicocalorimeter.
We start with two texts: a base  reference text  Tref,
and a  comparison text  Tcomp which we wish to compare
to Tref. In this paper, we will use the Contiguous US as
the reference text (weighting the phrase distributions of
each state equally), but in principle any text can be used
(e.g., in comparing two states, one would be selected as
a reference). Our interest is in determining which words
or phrases most contribute to or go against the di erence
in estimated calories. Ci/o(Tcomp)   Ci/o(Tref) where i/o
stands for in or out. Following [2] and using Eq. (3), we
can express the di erence as

= 0.39). This demonstrates why we might expect Cin
or Cout to separately correlate more strongly with other
population-level measures, and justi es forming a dash-
board using both Cin and Cout as well the composite
measure of Crat.
Regarding point 2 above, we have evidently made a
number of choices in computing Cin and Cout that mean
we have already introduced an arbitrary tuning of the
ratio Crat (e.g., assuming 100 grams of a food and an
hour s worth of activity). Having no principled way of
rescaling (i.e., one that is not a function of the data set
being studied), we have chosen to leave the measures as
computed. As we discuss later, in future iterations we
envisage for the Caloric Di erence version that introduc-
ing tunability of the dynamic ranges of Cin and Cout 
altering the bias of the measure toward food or activity 
will allow the Lexicocalorimeter to be re ned for a range
of purposes such as estimating correlates of diabetes lev-
els versus cancer rates (see Sec. II E).
C. Rankings for the contiguous US
Having taken in the maps of our three measures Cin,
Cout, and Crat, we now explore the rankings quantita-
tively,  rst through the histograms shown in Fig. 5. We
order the 48 states and DC by Crat (rightmost plot) and
=

contiguous US, all ranked by decreasing Crat. Bars indicate the di erence in the three quantities from the overall average with
colors corresponding to those used in Figs. 1, 2, and 3. We provide the same set of histograms re-sorted by Cin and Cout in
Figs. S2 and S3.
We now have a sum contributions due to all phrases. We
normalize these contributions as percentages and anno-
tate their structure as follows:

 Ci/o(s) =  100. We use the symbols
+/  and   /   to respectively encode whether the calo-
ries of a phrase exceed the average of the reference text,
and whether a phrase is being used more or less in the
comparison text. We call  Ci/o(s) the  per food/activity
phrase caloric expenditure shift . Finally, we sort phras-
es by the absolute value of  Ci/o(s) to create each phrase
shift.
In Fig. 6, we present food phrase shifts which help to
illustrate why:
  Colorado ranks 48/49 for
caloric
input Cin
ranks 12/49 for caloric input Cin
(Fig. 6A),
  Mississippi
(Fig. 6B),
  Colorado ranks 2/49 for caloric output Cout
(Fig. 6C),
  and Mississippi ranks 49/49 for caloric output Cout
(Fig. 6D).
These shifts display phrases that fall into four cate-
gories:

tities (here calories) being used more

Note that phrases are lemmas representing phrase categories. Overall, Colorado scores lower on Twitter food calories (257.4
versus 271.7) and higher on physical activity calories (203.5 versus 161.3) than Mississippi. We provide interactive phrase
shifts as part of the paper s Online Appendices at http://compstorylab.org/share/papers/alajajian2015a/ and at http:

often. Examples:  cookies  for Mississip-
pi in Fig. 6B and  rock climbing  for Col-
orado in Fig. 6C.

tities being used less often. Examples:
 watching tv or movie  for Mississippi in
Fig. 6B and  laying down  for Colorado
in Fig. 6C.
+ , pale yellow: Phrases representing above average quan-
tities being used less often. Examples:

and  running  for Mississippi in Fig. 6D.
- , blue: Phrases representing below average quan-
tities being used more often. Examples:
 reading  for Colorado in Fig. 6A and
 cat sh  for Mississippi in Fig. 6B.
Note that depending on the quantity, higher or lower may
be  better  and the four categories  ip signs in their sup-
port. For example, Cin and Cout increase with +  phras-
es; after we examine correlations with health and well-
being measures in Sec. II E, we will be able to interpret
this as  bad  for Cin and  good  for Cout.
At the top of each phrase shift, the bars indicate the
total contribution of each of the four types of phrases,
and the black bar the net change. We see that the four
net changes arise in di erent ways.
  Fig. 6A: Colorado is lower than average for Cin
largely due to tweeting more about relatively low
calorie (per 100 grams) foods:  noodles ,  egg ,
 pasta , and  turkey . We also  nd less tweets
about high calorie foods such as  candy ,  cake ,
and  cookies.  Going against these phrases, we see
Colorado does tweet relatively more about  bacon 
and  olive oil , and less about some relatively low-
er calorie foods  chicken ,  ice cream ,  shrimp ,
and  corn . We note that this does not mean these
foods are low calorie in absolute terms ( ice cream 
is a good example), just that 100 grams of them are
low calorie in comparison to the US baseline.
  Fig. 6B: Mississippi almost equally tweets less
about a variety of low calorie foods, e.g.,  pas-
ta ,  banana , and  crab  (pale blue bar) while
also tweeting more about the complementary range
of such foods including  shrimp ,  peaches , and
 pineapple  (dark blue bar). The modest net gain
is mostly due to a small increase in tweeting about
high calorie foods such as  cake ,  cookies , and
 sausage .
  Fig. 6C: For physical activity, tweets from Col-
orado show a preponderance of relatively high
caloric expenditure phrases (+ , yellow) includ-
ing  running ,  skiing ,  hiking ,  snowboard-
ing  and so on. Tweeting less about low e ort
activities is the only other contribution of any
substance Colorado tweets less about  eating ,
 laying down , and  watching tv or movie .
  Fig. 6D: Mississippi s low ranking in activity is
largely due to tweeting less about high output
activities (+ , pale yellow): less  running ,  danc-
ing ,  walking , and  biking . The second most
important category is an increase in low out-
put activity phrases such as  eating ,  attending
church , and  talking on the phone. 
In Figs. S4, S5, S6, and S7, we complement the
four phrase shifts of Fig. 6 by showing the top 23
phrases for each of four ways phrases may contribute.
Interactive phrase shifts for all of the contiguous US
are housed at http://panometer.org/instruments/
lexicocalorimeter.
Overall, we  nd the lexical texture a orded by our
phrase shifts is generally convincing, but we expect future
improvements in our food and activity data sets will
iron out some oddities (we again use the example of ice
cream). We also note that phrase shifts are very sen-
sitive and that terms that seem to be being evaluated
incorrectly may easily be removed from the phrase set,
and that doing so will minimally change the overall score
for su ciently large texts.
E. Correlations with other health and well-being
measures
We now turn to a suite of statistical comparisons
between our three measures caloric input, caloric out-
put, and caloric ratio and a collection of demographic,
behavioral, health, and psychological quantities.
We use Spearman s correlation coe cient   s to exam-
ine relationships between Cin, Cout, and Crat and 37
variables variously relating to food and physical activ-
ity,  Big Five  personality traits, and health and well-
being rankings (a total of 111 comparisons) [4, 6, 24 33].
To correct for multiple comparisons, we calculate the q-
value for each correlation coe cient using the Benjamini-
Hochberg step-up procedure [34] (the q-value is to be
interpreted in the same way as a p-value). We then con-
sider correlations in reference to the standard signi cance
levels of 0.01 and 0.05.
We must  rst acknowledge that many of the variables
we test against our measures are highly correlated with
each other. The food and physical activity-related vari-
ables are in the areas of physical activity levels, produce
intake and availability rates (including trends in public
schools), chronic disease rates, and rates of unhealthy
habits. Many of these variables are well known to be
in uenced by diet and physical activity (e.g., obesity
rates [25]), and others may be less directly related (e.g.,
percent of cropland in each state harvested for fruits and
vegetables [28]).
To give some grounding for the full set of compar-
isons, we show in Fig. 7 how six demographic quantities
11

correlation coe cient   s, and the Benjamini-Hochberg q-value. See Tab. I for a full summary of the 37 demographic quantities
studied here.
vary with caloric ratio Crat. We see strong correlations
with |  s|   0.68, and the highest value for Benjamini-
Hochberg q-value is 5.8 10 7.
We present a summary of all results in Tab. I where
we have ordered and numbered demographic quantities
in terms of ascending Benjamini-Hochberg q-values for
Crat. For comparison and to further demonstrate the
robustness of our approach, in Tabs. S1, S2, and S3), we
reproduce the same analysis with the inclusion of liquids
and for a di erential measure Cdi ( ) =  Cout   (1  
 )Cin, both with and without liquids. Here, we choose
to set the e ective means of Cout and Cin equal across
the statewide averages (i.e.,  (cid:104)Cout(cid:105) = (1    )(cid:104)Cin(cid:105)),
resulting in   = 0.598. Overall, we  nd little variation
in our results whether we use Crat and Cdi (0.598).
Surveying the health-based demographics, we found
Crat was signi cantly correlated with all chronic disease-
related rates we tested against (high blood pressure (#3),
adult diabetes (#4), adult overweight and obesity (#6),
heart disease deaths (#7), adult obesity (#8), childhood
overweight and obesity (#13), high cholesterol (#19),
and colorectal cancer (#22)). All of these but colorectal
cancer rate were also signi cantly correlated with Cout.
Caloric input Cin results were more mixed. Chron-
ic disease-related rates were also signi cantly correlated
with Cin, with the exception of adult diabetes, childhood
overweight and obesity, and high cholesterol, after cor-
recting for multiple comparisons.
The variables relating to unhealthy habits (smoking
(#16) and binge drinking rates (#26)) both correlated
signi cantly with all three of our measures with the one
exception of binge drinking and caloric input. The direc-
tion of correlations for these two habits are opposite each
other (e.g., negative for smoking and Crat, positive for
binge drinking and Crat), consistent with recent work on
alcohol consumption [35].
The two variables relating to physical activity rates
(percent of population that has had no physical activity
in past 30 days (#1), and percent of population that has
been physically active in past 30 days (#2)) correlated
signi cantly with all three of our measures. The two
measures relating to rates of physical and mental health
(average number of poor mental health days in past 30
days (#24), and average number of poor physical health
days in past 30 days (#27)) correlated signi cantly with
both Cout and Crat, but did not correlate signi cantly
with Cin.

The bottom 9 quantities were not signi cantly correlated with Crat according to our tests. Tabs. S1, S2, and S3 present the
same analysis for caloric measures including phrases representing liquids, and for the di erence Cdi ( ) =  Cout   (1    )Cin,
both without and with liquids included.
sumption rates all correlated signi cantly with all three
of our measures. The variables relating to presence of
produce in the state (percent of cropland in each state
harvested for fruits and vegetables (#33), percent of cen-
sus tracts with a healthy food retailer within one-half
mile (#35), and percent of schools o ering fruits and
vegetables at celebrations (#31)) were signi cantly cor-
related with Cin but were not correlated with Cout or
Crat. Variables relating to local food (number of farmers
markets per 100,000 people (#28) and Strolling of the
Heifers locavore score (#29)) were not signi cantly cor-
related with Cin, but were signi cantly correlated with
Cout.
Our health and well-being ranking variables included
the CNBC quality of life ranking (#5), Gallup Wellbe-
ing ranking (#9), America s Health Ranking overall state
rank (#10), life expectancy ranking (#11), Brain Health
ranking (#20), Gini
index score (#23), and George
Mason s overall freedom ranking (#36). Caloric ratio
correlated with all of these variables except for George
Mason s freedom ranking (which did not correlate with
any of our three measures). Cout correlated signi cantly
with all of these measures except for the Brain Health
ranking and the freedom ranking. caloric input Cin did
not correlate signi cantly with the CNBC quality of life
ranking, Gini index score, or freedom ranking.
Regarding correlations with the Big Five personality
traits, Pesta et al. noted that  Neuroticism...emerged as
the only consistent Big Five predictor of epidemiologic
outcomes (e.g., rates of heart disease or high blood pres-
sure) and health-related behaviors (e.g., rates of smoking
or exercise)  [36]. Additionally,  neuroticism correlates
with many health-related variables, including depression
and anxiety disorders, mortality, coping skill, death from
cardiovascular disease, and whether one smokes tobac-
co  [36]. Here, in keeping with these observations, we
found that neuroticism (#25) was indeed the only Big
Five personality trait that correlated signi cantly and
negatively with caloric ratio.
We also tested our three measures against two mea-
sures of socioeconomic status median income (#17) and
percent of state with a bachelor s degree or higher level
of education (#21) and found these correlations were
signi cant for all three of our measures.
III. CONCLUDING REMARKS
Our Lexicocalorimeter has thus, when applied to Twit-
ter, proved to  nd and demonstrate a range of strong,
commonsensical patterns and correlations for the con-
tiguous US. We invite the reader to explore our online
instrument, a screenshot of which is shown in Fig. 8.
Given the complex relationships between health, well-
being, happiness, and various measures of socioeconomic
status, it is rather di cult to say that we are only mea-
suring health or only measuring well-being. We are also
measuring socioeconomic status to some extent. Howev-
er, the correlations between caloric ratio and measures of
socioeconomic status are not as strong as the correlation
of caloric ratio with many of the other measures. Given
the above, we believe that the caloric content of tweets
can be used successfully, along with other well-being and
quality of life measures, to help gauge overall well-being
in a population.
There are many potential
forward directions. A
promising avenue is to incorporate tunability to the Lexi-
cocalorimeter by manipulating its dynamic range. While
we chose the caloric ratio Crat for its generality in the
main body of this work, there is more  exibility in the
measurement of caloric di erence: Cdi ( ) =  Cout  
(1    )Cin. Though a universal approach is unclear ( 
13
should be independent of the particular data set being
studied), we may pro t from the versatility of Cdi ( )
when focusing on a single demographic. For example,
if we are interested in diabetes rates, we could tune the
instrument to obtain the best correlation with known lev-
els, and thereby create a real-time estimator. To do so,
we would tune   and  nd the value that gives the highest
correlation between Cdi ( ) and diabetes rates for a giv-
en set of populations. Of course, we could use a  black
box  method to generate a more optimal  t, but in bas-
ing our instrument on food and activity words, we have
a far more principled approach that grants us the oppor-
tunity not just to mimic but to understand and explain
patterns that we  nd. In particular, our word shifts will
be of great use in showing why our hypothetical estimate
of diabetes is varying across populations.
We fully recognize that the Twitter population is not
the same as the general population; Twitter users di er
from the general population in terms of race, age, and
urbanity [7]. However, we currently have no reliable way
to know, for example, the true age, race, gender, and
education level of individual users and as such, are not
able to adjust for these factors. While we were able to
vet our food and physical activity lists to some extent
(as described in Methods and Materials), we could not
realistically go through every tweet to be certain that
the phrase was being used in the way that we thought.
We realize that even if the phrases are being used as we
imagine, it does not necessarily mean that the person
who tweeted actually performed the physical activity or
ate the tweeted-about food (West et al. address a sim-
ilar issue in inferring food consumption from accessing
recipes online [18]).
We also currently do not know at what point our met-
ric breaks down at smaller time scales (e.g., months or
weeks) or for smaller spatial regions (e.g., city or county)
level. Our preliminary research shows that the physical
activity metric on its own may be quite e ective at the
city level, but the food measure may not be accurate on
a smaller scale. We have also found the physical activi-
ty list to be robust to random partitioning [37], whereas
the food list was not. We believe that these preliminary
 ndings may be due to several factors: (a) the size of the
food list (just over 1400 phrases) is much smaller than
the physical activity phrase list (just over 13,400 phras-
es); (b) there are generally more tweets about physical
activities in our list than the foods in our food list; and
(c) the amount of data within a city may not be a large
enough sample for any food-based Twitter metric. We
note that we have not tried using the metric on counties
or Census block or tract groups, and it may be that these
are more conducive to the metric.
We propose to use crowdsourcing as a way to build a
more comprehensive food phrase list that includes com-
monly eaten foods with brand names as well as food slang
that we did not capture here. Ideally, we would arrive
at a food phrase database similar in scale to that of our
existing physical activity phrase list. However we move

IV. METHODS AND MATERIALS
In order to attempt to estimate the  caloric content 
of text-extracted phrases [37] relating to food (caloric
input) and physical activity (caloric output), we needed
comprehensive lists of foods and physical activities and
their respective caloric content and expenditure informa-
tion. Here, we explain in detail how we constructed these
phrase lists and assigned calories to each phrase.
In dataset S1 (https://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.
figshare.4530965.v1), we provide message IDs for all
tweets that are part of our study, and we make both this
dataset and other material and visualizations available at
the paper s Online Appendices (http://compstorylab.
org/share/papers/alajajian2015a/, and as part of
our Panometer project at http://panometer.org/
A. Calorie estimates for phrases
We used the USDA National Nutrient Database [38] to
approximate the caloric content of foods, and the Com-
pendium of Physical Activities from Arizona State Uni-
versity and the National Cancer Institute [39] to approx-
imate average Metabolic Equivalent of Tasks (METs)
for physical activities, which we converted to calories
expended per hour of activity [39]. Because the foods
listed in the USDA National Nutrient Database are not
described in a way that people talk about food, we creat-
ed a list of food phrases used on Twitter by starting with
a kernel of basic food terms from the USDA s MyPlate
website s food group pages [40]. If the food phrase was
not speci c, such as  cereal , we chose the most popular
version of that food in the United States via an informal
Google search at the time of the study (in this instance,
Cheerios). If a brand name food was not in the USDA
National Nutrient Database, we chose the closest match
we could  nd. (Please note that this means that data in
appendix may be inaccurate when searching brand name
items.)
This approach yielded examples of foods in the food
groups of fruits, vegetables, grains, proteins, dairy, oils,
solid fats, and  empty calories  (e.g., junk food), and
built up a list of nearly 1400 food phrases used on Twit-
ter. For the main results we present in this study, we did
not include drinks or soups (liquids) in our list. We found
there is very little change in our  ndings when liquids are
included, as we discuss below, and we have omitted them
at present both for simplicity and because we were not
satis ed with a straightforward way of balancing liquid
and solid nutrition estimates. Note that we have includ-
ed ice creams, oils, and some other items that may act
as liquids, and these could be separated out for future
versions of our instrument.
For physical activity, we used the physical activities
listed in the Compendium to build up a list of nearly
14,000 physical activity phrases used on Twitter. The
order of magnitude of di erence between the length of the
two lists exists because of the di erence in the number of
terms that went into creating each list and the rates at
which people tweet about foods vs. physical activities.
B. Phrase extraction
A major obstacle to the development of the food and
physical activity lists is the determination of those phras-
es used by individuals that most accurately represent a
food or physical activity. Various methods exist which
may help one ascertain information about the frequency
of usage of higher-order lexical units [37]. However, we
require one that not only determines reasonable estimates
of frequency of usage, but further, does so with nuance
regarding context. For example, one should not count the
phrase  apple  as having occurred if it appeared within a
larger phrase that was recognized as meaningful, such as
 you re the apple of my eye.  To accomplish these goals,
we de ne a low-assumption text segmentation algorithm,
which we refer to as serial partitioning.
Serial text partitioning is a greedy algorithm (see
Alg. 1) for  nding distinct, coherent subsequences (phras-
es) within a sequence (clause). It relies on the direction-
ality of a sequence, and so is particularly adept for pro-
cessing text into multi-word expressions for many modern
languages. The algorithm relies on an objective function,
which we will generally refer to as L. At a high level,
the algorithm seeks to  nd  nd the largest subsequences
possible, following a chain of optimizing, growing subse-
quences.
In the context of this article, we de ne L relative to a
text T as follows, providing pseudocode below. First, let
f : S   R 0 be the random partition frequency function
[37] under the pure random partition probability (q =
1
2 ) for the text T . We then apply the model of context
developed in [41] under the parameterization q = 1, so
that a given phrase s is a member of (cid:96)(s) contexts Cs (e.g.,
the phrase s = (N ew, Y ork, City) is a member of three
contexts, labeled Cs = {( , Y ork, City), (N ew, , City),
and (N ew, Y ork, )}). Then for C   Cs, we consider the
context-local likelihood probabilities:
P (s | C) =
f (s)(cid:80)
,
f (t)
t C
15
(7)
(8)
and prescribe to s the likelihood-minimizing context
Cs = argmin
C Cs
(P (s | C)),
which chooses the context-pattern that is most prevalent
in T . The objective function for this instantiation of
serial partitioning is then de ned as
L(s) = P (s | Cs),
(9)
and referred to as the local likelihood of a phrase s.
Algorithm 1 Serial text partitioning of a (left-to-right)
directional clause, given an objective function L : S  
R 0 (whose maximization is desired, in this case) that
is zero on the empty phrase ( ), and a clause t =
(t1,    , t(cid:96)(t)), consisting of (cid:96)(t) words. Note that for
any a, b   S, a(cid:95)b = (a1,    , a(cid:96)(a), b1,    b(cid:96)(b)) denotes
the concatenation of phrases, and that for convenience, a
single sequence element, ai, may be treated as sequence
of one term, (ai).

We manually applied the following criteria for con-
structing both food and exercise phrase lists. For a
phrase to be included, it had to be a phrase that used the
food or physical activity word(s) in a way that pertained
to eating or physical activity; we excluded phrases that
were part of hashtags, Twitter user names, song lyrics,
or names of organizations or businesses, and phrases that
appeared four or fewer times were not included. Mis-
spellings and alternate spellings were included if we hap-
pened upon them (for example,  mash potatoes  instead
of  mashed potatoes ), but we did not go out of our way
to search for them. We queried questionable phrases to
be sure that the majority of their uses were referring to
the item of interest. Because we were building up from
a small list, some speci c versions of foods were included
16
while more general forms were not. For example, because
we built phrases up from  strawberry,   strawberry jam 
was included while we did not conduct a larger search for
 jam . In another example, in building phrases up from
 bacon,   bacon wrapped dates  turned up so we includ-
ed those dates but did not conduct a larger search for all
possible  dates . (Note: We removed the physical activi-
ties category  sexual activity  from the study because the
task of determining meaning and context was too di -
cult.)
We searched for phrases containing the physical activ-
ities in multiple tenses in order to capture as much infor-
mation as possible. For example, for the activity type
shoveling snow, we searched for the forms of shovel, shov-
eling, and shoveled. Tweets were initially converted to all
lowercase text, so we were assured that we were not miss-
ing data due to capitalization. To match each food phrase
with its closest caloric data, we found the most closely
corresponding food from the USDA National Nutrient
Database, counting all vegetables and fruits in their raw
form unless the phrase indicated otherwise. Similarly, we
entered meats as roasted or cooked with dry heat, not
fried, unless the phrase indicated otherwise or there was
no homemade option. We used the nutrition content of
homemade versions of foods (for example, baked goods)
rather than store-bought foods unless the phrase indicat-
ed otherwise. Our approach, while systematic, was not
exhaustive, nor is it the only way of taking on this chal-
lenge; there are certainly other methods that we expect
to yield similar results.
Finally, we lemmatized the food phrases by their code
in the USDA National Nutrient Database. If there were
food phrases that were more general in each set of phrases
that held the same code, we used the more general phrase
as the lemma.
We lemmatized the activity phrases by their METs and
activity category. Activity categories were largely the
same as listed in the Compendium with slight changes
due to items in Compendium being listed in a Miscella-
neous category, etc. This yielded instances of physical
activity phrases that were in the same activity catego-
ry but were very di erent with the same METs being
included in the same lemma. From this level of lemmati-
zation, we then used our best judgement to break these
lemmas down further until proper phrases were included
in each lemma.
