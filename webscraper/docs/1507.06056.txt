Abstract
During 2008-2015, twenty-two introductory workshops on graph and geometric algo-
rithms were organized for teachers and students (undergraduate, post-graduate and doc-
toral) of engineering colleges and universities at different states and union territories of
India. The lectures were meant to provide exposure to the  eld of graph and geometric
algorithms and to motivate the participants towards research. Fifty-eight professors from
TIFR, IITs, IISc, IMSc, CMI, ISI Kolkata, and other institutes and universities delivered
invited lectures on different topics in the design and analysis of algorithms, discrete ap-
plied mathematics, computer graphics, computer vision, and robotics. The  rst four work-
shops were funded by TIFR, BRNS and IIT Kharagpur, and the remaining workshops were
funded by the NBHM. In this paper, we present the salient features of these workshops,
and state our observations on the national impact of these workshops.
1 Introduction
1.1 Background
Ab u Jafar Muhammad al-Khw arizm  , a Persian astronomer and mathematician, wrote a trea-
tise in 825 AD, Kit ab his ab al-adad al-h. ind   (Book on Calculation with Hindu Numerals),
which was translated into Latin in the early 12th century as Liber Algorismi de numero In-
dorum (The Book of Algorismi on Indian Numerals). The word  Algorism   the Latin form
of al-Khw arizm   s name   came to be applied to any systematic work on ancient Indian-style
computational mathematics. The present term  algorithm  is a distorted form of  algorism 
[10].
The  eld of algorithms, which is at the very heart of computer science, has witnessed a
number of signi cant advances during the last  ve decades. These advances include the devel-
opment of faster algorithms and the discovery of certain natural problems for which all known
algorithms are inef cient [12]. These startling results have kindled a keen interest in the area of
algorithm design and analysis. Teaching and research in this foundational aspect of computing
is therefore a natural and desirable thrust area.
1
As algorithms are also at the heart of every nontrivial computer application, computer scien-
tists and professional programmers are expected to know about the basic algorithmic toolbox:
structures that allow ef cient organization and retrieval of data, frequently used algorithms
and generic techniques for modeling, understanding and solving algorithmic problems. Hence,
algorithmic studies form a major component of computer science programs in colleges and
universities.
In the last four decades, graph and geometric problems have been studied by computer
science researchers using the framework of design and analysis of algorithms [1, 33]. While
graph algorithms have been studied for almost 300 years, graphs provide essential models for
many application areas of computer science, and at the same time, they are fascinating objects
of study in pure and applied mathematics. There have been a number of exciting developments
in graph theory that are important for designers of algorithms. Correspondingly, the algorithmic
viewpoint of computer science has stimulated much research in graph theory. Graph theory and
graph algorithms are inseparably intertwined subjects.
On the other hand, the main impetus for the development of geometric algorithms came
from the progress in computer graphics, computer-aided design and manufacturing [2].
In
addition, algorithms are also designed for geometric problems that are classical in nature. The
success of the  eld can be explained from the beauty of the geometry problems studied, the
solutions obtained, and by the many application domains   computer graphics, geographic
information systems, robotics and others, in which geometric algorithms play a crucial role.
1.2 Motivation
We know that basic algorithmic research has helped building today s computer technology
and will keep on playing a crucial role in the achievement of tomorrow s technological break-
throughs. Therefore, we believe that algorithmic research is certainly important even for India.
At present, research is being carried out in India in several sub-areas of algorithms and
results are being published in reputed conferences and journals in computer science and dis-
crete applied mathematics. Algorithmic research started in India in premier academic institutes
like TIFR, IITs and IISc, way back in the 70 s. In recent years, algorithmic research is also
carried out in computer industries in India including Microsoft Research, IBM Research, TCS
Innovation Labs, etc. Today, computer industries in India provide  nancial support to projects
on algorithmic research in Indian academic institutes and also provide fellowships to Ph.D.
students working in algorithmic research.
The need for algorithmic research in India was felt in the late 70 s. Perceiving future needs,
the course  Design and Analysis of Algorithms  was introduced in the 80 s in the undergradu-
ate and postgraduate levels as a core course in premier institutes like IIT s, TIFR and IISc. This
course used to cover asymptotic analysis of running time and space requirements for quantita-
tively measuring the ef ciency of algorithms, searching and sorting algorithms, data structures,
sequential algorithms for graph and geometric problems, NP-completeness, etc.
Designing ef cient algorithms for graph and geometric problems within the framework of
the design and analysis of algorithms started also around the same time. There were a few
researchers in India (including S. N. Maheshwari (IIT Delhi), C. E. Veni Madhavan (IISc Ban-
galore), Subir Ghosh (TIFR Mumbai)), who were involved in algorithmic research during that
time. In the 90 s, Ph.D. and Master theses on algorithms for graph and geometric problems
started coming up in increasing numbers, demonstrating the acceptability of algorithmic re-
search in India. Many of these theses for designing ef cient algorithms used mathematical
2
techniques from combinatorics, probability theory, graph theory, etc., and algorithmic tech-
niques like greedy methods, divide and conquer, approximations, randomization, etc.
On the other hand, after personal computers became more and more available in India in
the late 80 s, a large number of scientists, engineers and administrators in India across all dis-
ciplines started using personal computers for solving problems arising in research, applications
and in commerce. This gave rise to the need of computer programmers, as the IT industries
proliferated. Naturally, several softwares were designed in 80 s and 90 s and many of them
used basic algorithmic techniques and data structures that were routinely taught in the courses
of  Design and Analysis of Algorithms  not only in IITs, IISc and TIFR but also in NITs, BITS
Pilani, and several universities in India. Algorithmic studies gained further impetus in the 90 s
in India like anywhere in the world after personal computers became connected through net-
works, forming the world wide web. New types of algorithms like streaming algorithms, web-
based algorithms, network algorithms, distributed algorithms, big data algorithms, etc. came
into play in the last two decades.
Though the number of researchers working in India on graph and geometric algorithms has
increased substantially in the last two decades, the number of active researchers in algorithms
is still far lesser in India compared to the large number of bright students and teachers involved
in studying and teaching computer science and discrete applied mathematics. In order to moti-
vate them towards computer science research in general and algorithmic research in particular,
twenty-two workshops of introductory lectures on graph and geometric algorithms were orga-
nized during 2008-2015 for teachers and students (undergraduate, post-graduate, and doctoral)
of engineering colleges and universities at different locations in India.
Our workshop series may be viewed as a human resource development program for raising
the level of algorithmic knowledge amongst Indian college and university students and teachers
in computer science and discrete applied mathematics.

In addition to coordinators, two groups of people were involved in organizing these work-
shops. One group typically consisted of students and staff of host institutes who were involved
essentially during the workshop days. The other group consisted of administrative and techni-
cal staff of School of Technology and Computer Science, TIFR who were involved from the
preparatory phase till the completion of every workshop spanning a period of over 3-4 months.

Mr. Raymond J. D Mello worked as the secretary for this workshop series for the entire period
of 2008-2015; he was assisted by Mr. John Barretto, Mr. Pravin N. Bhuwad, Mr. W. K. Gawade
and Mr. Nitin S. Gawandi. Workshop websites for all the workshops during 2009-2015 were
designed, developed, updated and maintained by Mr. Ravikumar Naik, and he also provided a
necessary platform for online registration of participants.
2.2 Financial support
The  rst four workshops were funded by Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR), Indian
Institute of Technology, Kharagpur (IITKGP), and the Board of Research in Nuclear Science
(BRNS) of the Department of Atomic Energy, Government of India (see Table II(a)), and the
remaining eighteen workshops were funded by the National Board for Higher Mathematics
(NBHM), Department of Atomic Energy, Government of India (see Table II(b)). There was
no registration fee for the workshops after the  rst three workshops. Thus the workshops
were almost entirely funded by the above mentioned organizations.
In addition, some host
institutes provided small grants to cover some local expenses. In most cases, host institutes
provided many facilities including auditoriums and guest houses at subsidized rates. Some
invited speakers used their own travel grants for paying their air fares. Taking all these facts
into consideration, it can be seen that budgets for the workshops were indeed quite low.

2.3
Invited lectures
In the 22 workshops, 266 invited lectures were delivered by 58 professors under 114 lecture
titles. A complete list is given in Appendix. These lectures can be classi ed broadly into
four categories: (i) Algorithmic Paradigms, (ii) Graphs and Algorithms, (iii) Geometry and
Algorithms, and (iv) Geometry and Applications.
Under algorithmic paradigms, introductory lectures were delivered on different types of
algorithms [8, 20]. Speci cally, approximation algorithms [35], randomized algorithms [27],
on-line algorithms [4], distributed algorithms [24],  xed parameter algorithms [29], quantum
algorithms [30] and streaming algorithms [28] were covered.
Under graphs and algorithms, introductory lectures were delivered on graph theory [3, 14,
16, 18], networks [34], graph algorithms [20, 23] and scheduling [22]. Speci c topics covered
6
from graph theory were graph matching, graph representations, extremal graphs, graph parti-
tioning, probabilistic graphs, topological minors of graphs, expander graphs, graph coloring,
graph spanners, and graph spectra. Similarly, speci c topics covered from graph algorithms
were planarity testing, network  ow, shortest paths, social networks and wireless networks.
Under geometry and algorithms, introductory lectures were delivered on computational ge-
ometry [2, 13, 31], combinatorial geometry [11, 25] and digital geometry [19]. Speci c topics
of computational and combinatorial geometry covered were geometric graphs, facility location,
convexity of points, art gallery problems, duality transformation, geometric data structures, ge-
ometric shortest paths, geometric spanners, Voronoi diagrams, centerpoint location, and geo-
metric prune and search technique. Similarly, speci c topics covered from digital geometry
were shape transformations by local interchanges, algorithms for circles and spheres in digital
space, isothetic covers for digital objects, anatomies of lines and circles in the light of number
theory and on good digital distances.
Under geometry and applications, introductory lectures were delivered on computer graph-
ics [5, 9, 26], computer vision [17, 32], visualization [15] and robotics [6, 21]. Speci c topics
covered from these application areas were 3D reconstruction from images and videos, pro-
jective geometry for graphics and computer vision, visibility maps for point clouds, motion
structure using shape spaces, character animation, haptic rendering, symmetry and structure
detection for 3D geometry, rendering using directional distance maps, cache friendly com-
pressed representation of geometry, modeling for shape classes, manifold discovery in data,
scalar  eld visualization, 3D surface reconstruction, graphics processor units, mesh genera-
tion, object recognition, a number theoretic introduction to geometry, and sequential and online
algorithms for robot path planning.
2.4 Participants
Participants of the workshops were mainly undergraduate, post-graduate and doctoral students
and teachers of computer science and discrete applied mathematics. They were required to have
taken basic courses in discrete mathematics, data structures and algorithms at the undergraduate
level. There were around  fty participants in the  rst workshop at CRCE Mumbai. Since then,
the number of participants were at least 90 in every workshop. In some workshops, there were
around 120 participants. The workshop at IIT Guwahati had the maximum number of 156
participants.
Normally, around three-fourths of the participants were from the host institute and its nearby
institutes and university. The remaining participants, who were from the same state and from
neighboring states, were provided with return train fares and free boarding and lodging. All
participants were provided free lunch and snacks, and were issued certi cates for attending
workshops. Also, a standard textbook on algorithms (Indian edition) was gifted to every par-
ticipant for further study.
3 Impact on the participants
3.1
Interaction
Usually, there were 4 or 5 invited one-hour lectures in a day. Many of these lectures were
designed as interactive lectures. Around 10-20% of the participants took active part in such
interactions and many of them got inspired by this opportunity to involve themselves. Interac-
tion with speakers continued during lunch and tea breaks. The active participants were mostly
7
students from IITs, IISc, some NITs, BITS Pilani and ISI, Kolkata. Although around 15-30%
participants were really at a loss during many of the lectures, the remaining participants fol-
lowed several lectures even though they did not interact during the lecture. In fact, many of
them met the speakers during breaks and clari ed doubts. At the end of each workshop, we
always had a feedback session. We received appreciation and valuable comments in feedback
sessions. We also received emails from participants after almost every workshop on the merits
and demerits of the workshop.
In every workshop, there was a session on open problems in which unsolved research prob-
lems on algorithms were stated and discussed. Many participants showed interest in the ses-
sions on open problems.
3.2 Panel discussion
The general trend for computer science students in India is to take up a job in IT industry af-
ter completing B.Tech or M. Tech. degree. Most of them do not even consider that research
in computer science could be his/her profession. In view of this, a panel discussion was con-
ducted in every workshop on the topic  Is research a good career option?  Normally, some
young invited speakers of the workshop took the role of panelists. During the discussions,
participants asked panelists questions on various career options: What are the bene ts in a re-
search profession? What are the pitfalls in a research career? How much salary one can expect
in research profession? What are the good institutes in India for doing research? How can one
get a good research guide? Can good research be done in an industry? How do I convince my
parents that research is a viable career option? Is it not better to do research in the USA rather
than in India? During the panel discussions, extensive interactions took place due to diverse
opinions and counter-opinions expressed by panelists and participants. We observed that panel
discussion was an extremely effective way for motivating participants towards research.
4 Concluding remarks
We understand that the workshops have indeed inspired some students to seriously consider
algorithmic research as a career option. In fact, professors of the various host institutes have
informed us that some of their students, who are now pursuing Ph.D. program in computer
science (in India or abroad), were actually motivated by our workshops. Moreover, the bene-
 ts from the exposure to the broad  eld of graph and geometric algorithms will certainly get
re ected in the future profession of many of the participants. As organizers, we felt that it was
worth making the effort, and we hope that in the interest of the nation and in the interest of
algorithmic studies (in which India was a pioneer), such efforts will continue in the future.
