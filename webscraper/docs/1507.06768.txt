Abstract 
It is well acknowledged that innovation is a key success factor in mobile service domain. Having 
creative ideas is the first critical step in the innovation process. Many studies suggest that 
customers are a valuable source of creative ideas. However, the literature also shows that adults 
may be constrained by existing technology frames, which are known to hinder creativity. Instead 
young children (aged 7-12) are considered digital natives yet are free from existing technology 
frames. This led us to study them as a potential source for creative mobile service ideas. A set of 
41,000 mobile ideas obtained from a research project in 2006 granted us a unique opportunity to 
study the mobile service ideas from young children. We randomly selected two samples of ideas 
(N=400 each), one contained the ideas from young children, the other from adults (aged 17-50). 
These ideas were evaluated by several evaluators using an existing creativity framework. The 
results show that the mobile service ideas from the young children are significantly more 
original, transformational, implementable, and relevant than those from the adults. Therefore, 
this study shows that young children are better sources of novel and quality ideas than adults in 
the mobile services domain. This study bears significant contributions to the creativity and 
innovation research. It also indicates a new and valuable source for the companies that seek for 
creative ideas for innovative products and services.

1.  Introduction 
Creative ideas, as a starting point of any innovation endeavor, play a crucial role for companies who 
seek competitive advantages in a turbulent marketplace (Cox & Blake, 1991). This is especially true 
for the companies operating in mobile service sectors and related business. In this paper, mobile 
service is used as an umbrella term to refer to mobile apps, mobile software-as-a-service, hardware 
and any combinations of them. Several changes occurred in the mobile service market since the 
Apple App Store, the Google Play store, and the Nokia Ovi store started opening in 2007 (Lane et 
al., 2010). These platforms have revolutionized the concept of the mobile phone, hosting the release 
of new content every day. Nowadays, the majority of mobile devices require services such as voice 
and data services, SMS (Short Message Service), video streaming, location-based services, etc. For 
the companies in this arena, one key question they need to constantly answer is: where are the ideas 
for the next leading mobile services coming from?  
Innovative ideas can come from both inside and outside a company. Companies that utilize external 
actors and sources in their idea generation processes tend to be more innovative (Laursen & Salter, 
2006). Research into the relationship between customer and product innovation maintains that 
existing customers are often considered a valuable source of creativity and innovation (von Hippel, 
1986). The  voice of customer  needs to be heard (Laursen & Salter, 2006). Listening to the voices 
of customers and observing their behaviors may provide valuable data on unsatisfied needs and 
point to creative solutions to existing problems. However, for high technology industries such as 
mobile technology, it has been argued that ordinary customers are not a good source for new ideas 
because  real-world experience of ordinary users is often rendered obsolete by the time a product is 
developed or during the time of its projected commercial lifetime  (von Hippel, 1986). The widely 
employed term lead users those users who face needs that will be general in a marketplace several 
months or years before ordinary users do is coined in the same study. Von Hippel (1986) argued 
 
 
3 
that lead users are in a better position to provide accurate data on future needs; however, they suffer 
the same constraints of ordinary customers posed by their real world experience and available 
technology. 
Children, on the other hand, are one group of people who suffer less from the above mentioned 
constraints (Druin, 2002), and a never-ending source of imagination (Scaife & Rogers, 1998). They 
are less constrained by existing technology frame due to their little life experience. Still, they 
somehow remain as a neglected group by market and innovation research, perhaps due to the 
traditional views of the all-knowing adults and the all-learning children (Druin, 2002). Children are 
not considered a lead user group as defined by von Hippel (1986), and they cannot even be 
considered as a customer group due to their lack of purchasing power. However, the studies 
conducted before the Internet age hint that children, especially young children, are more creative 
than people from other age groups. Children have been proposed to be part of the processes to 
design new technologies, in the roles of informants, design partners or even leaders (Druin, 2002, 
2010; Read, 2015; Vint, 2005; Yip et al., 2013). The mobile phone industry might really benefit 
from this neglected source of creative ideas. 
Can young children be a valuable source of creative mobile service ideas? This is the research 
question that our study sets out to answer. As far as the authors are aware of, there are no other 
studies along this line of inquiry. The purpose of this study is to have a better understanding of the 
voices of young children in terms of creative mobile service ideas. To this end, two sets of mobile 
service ideas randomly sampled from a larger survey conducted in 2006 were analyzed. One set 
contained 400 unique ideas expressed by a group of young children of 7 to 12 years old. The other 
set included 400 distinctive ideas from a group of adults aged from 17 to 50 years. These ideas were 
analyzed using a conceptual framework of creativity derived from literature, in which creativity is 
conceptualized as a compound concept with two dimensions: novelty and quality. Both dimensions 
 
 
4 
have two associated constructs: originality and paradigm relatedness for the novelty dimension, and 
relevance and workability for quality (Dean, Hender, Rodgers, & Santanen, 2006). We tested the 
difference between the two samples along the above-mentioned dimensions and constructs. The 
findings of our study empirically demonstrate that young children are actually a valuable source to 
derive novel ideas that are also of high quality. In contrast, the adults  ideas are deemed to be less 
novel and of lower quality. 
The remaining part of the paper is organized as follows. This section continues with laying out the 
background and related work. The concept of creativity is investigated in the Conceptualization of 
Creative Ideas sub-section. The research approach is described in the following section. Then the 
Result section reports the obtained outcomes of the study, which are further discussed in the light of 
relevant studies in the Discussion section. The limitations of the study are reflected upon in the 
same section. The last section concludes the paper and outlines future work. 
1.1.  Mobile Services 
According to Alahuhta (2011), mobile services are  radio communications services between mobile 
devices while in motion or between such stations and fixed points of services (computer 
systems/servers) . The architecture of mobile service systems can be decomposed into three 
components: 1) Wireless communication infrastructure, 2) mobile terminals and 3) mobile (content) 
services and apps. The majority of mobile services and apps rely on cellular networks. Although 
many apps function in offline mode, nowadays users have to be online to benefit from most mobile 
services.  
For end users the most concrete embodiment of mobile services is the mobile device itself. Within 
a decade a great development has occurred in mobile devices. This development is mainly due to 
the miniaturization and an increasing level of integration of electronic devices. After the 
 
 
5 
introduction of physical full keyboards to business-oriented mobile phones, the product line has 
greatly developed in terms of the number of cellular bands, the quality of display, the amount of 
memory and storage, the variety of data access methods, the capabilities of running mobile 
applications and the number of features. Desoli & Filippi (2006) presented the evolution of mobile 
terminals and stated that new upcoming modular devices could satisfy increasing user demand. The 
size and weight of mobile devices have decreased steadily until the introduction of touch-based 
smartphones where, due to the new interaction method and improved user experience, the displays 
have become larger than earlier.  The first iPhone sale on June 29th, 2007 is a watershed of mobile 
terminals and the boom of the smartphone era. Additional File 1 is a portrait of the technological 
evolution of mobile terminals using typical phones of the year as examples. 
Mobile content services and apps can be classified in different ways. Alahuhta, Abrahamsson, & 
Nummiaho (2008) suggested a list of categories from an end-user perspective, including 
information pull and push, service request, locating persons, objects, identification, etc. The full list 
of categories and descriptions can be seen in Table 1.  
Table 1. Categorization of mobile services 
Category 
Description 
Information pull 
Retrieving information for some purpose.  
Information push 
Receiving information automatically. 
Locating (persons/objects) 
Locating or following some (nearest) person or 
object.

Service request 
Ordering a personal service (possibly based on

location). 
Content production

Other mobile service ideas  Applications that do not fit into other categories. 
 
Until 2009 the distribution of mobile content services and apps used to be controlled either by 
device manufacturers or traditional telecom operators. In July 2008 Apple launched the App Store 
to promote mobile applications for the iPhone and iPod mobile handsets. Similarly, Google 
launched its own store for applications running the Android operating system in October 2008. 
These are the two most popular and well-known application stores. The application stores attempt 
to integrate applications closely with devices, so that application downloading is simple and easy 
and the user experience is optimized (Alahuhta, 2011).  
1.2.  Source of Creative Ideas 
The mobile service domain is highly dynamic and innovation plays a crucial role (Siau & Shen, 
2003). Obtaining creative ideas is the first step towards innovation. McLean (2005) stated that 
 without creative ideas [...] innovation is an engine without any fuel , and further elaborated that 
 no innovation is possible without the creative processes that mark the front end of the process: 
identifying important problems and opportunities, gathering information, generating new ideas, 
and exploring the validity of those ideas  (p.227). 
Where do creative ideas come from? Ideas for new products or processes can come from both inside 
and outside a company. Laursen & Salter (2006) claimed that companies who use external actors 
 
 
7 
and sources in their idea generation processes tend to be more innovative. Customer needs and 
consumer trends are often a valuable source of innovation. Ideas provided by end users can play a 
major role in the development of new services. For example, one case study of banking services 
showed that the customers of the bank proposed ca. 40 new functionalities. In comparison only 7 
novel functionalities were proposed by the bank itself (Oliveira & Von Hippel, 2011). Therefore, 
the  voice of customer  needs to be heard (Laursen & Salter, 2006).  
However, for novel products characterized by rapid change such as mobile services, the insights of 
existing customers and users into new product, process, or service needs and potential solutions are 
 constrained by their own real-world experience  (von Hippel, 1986). As a consequence, 
customers  steeped in the present  are  unlikely to generate novel product concepts which conflict 
with the familiar  (p. 791), as the familiarity with the attributes and uses of existing products affect 
an individual's ability to conceive novel attributes and uses. It also affects the ability to conceive 
new product needs, especially in high technology industries (von Hippel, 1986). Von Hippel (1986) 
coined the term "lead users" of a product whose needs will become general in a marketplace months 
or years in the future, and who do have real-life experience with novel product or process concepts 
of interest. They are in a better position than  ordinary  users to provide new product concept and 
design data. 
However, von Hippel (1986) admitted that the insights of lead users could be as constrained to the 
familiarity as those of other users. Therefore, a natural question to ask is, who are the group of 
people that are least constrained by their own real-world experience and familiarity with existing 
technologies? This points our attention to children.

1.2.1.   Creativity of Children 
Several studies investigating creativity based on a person s age have agreed that children are more 
creative than adults, because they explore the world with  fresh eyes . Instead, rather than 
producing ideas based on received new information, adults are eliminating information to simplify 
daily routine (Vint, 2005; von Hippel, 1986, 1988). According to Vint (2005), Land & Jarman 
(1993) evaluated an individual s creativity over the time. A three-step research has been conducted: 
1) in 1968, 1,600 five-year old children were studied and 98% of them were evaluated as creative; 
2) in 1973, those children were tested again as they were ten years old   30% being creative, 3) in 
1978, a final test was conducted on the same group of children when they were teenagers (fifteen 
years old)   only 12% of them were considered creative. On the other hand, the same study 
evaluated 280,000 adults and only 2% of them were considered creative. Therefore, the younger a 
person is, the higher the tendency of being creative.  
However, how  fresh eyed  are today s children in terms of information technologies? Today's 
children have been characterized as being digital natives, as opposed to their parents and 
instructors, who are better considered as digital immigrants (Prensky, 2001). Recent studies have 
reported how high is the amount of digital-based experience that children have been exposed. It has 
been shown that there is an increasing use of computers, Internet, videogames, and mobile devices 
by children (Subrahmanyam, Greenfield, Kraut, & Gross, 2001). In particular, it has been shown 
that half of the children in ten U.K. primary schools were already mobile phone owners before 2004 
(Davie, Panting, & Charlton, 2004). When smartphone is concerned, a recent research project found 
that 40% of European boys and 37% of European girls aged 9-12 have a smartphone for private use 
(Mascheroni &  lafsson, 2013). 
Would the familiarity with information technologies prevent children from being creative, as it puts 
constraints on adults? Not necessarily. For example, Jackson et al. (2012) investigated children 
 
 
9 
creativity and information technology use, and revealed a certain correlation existing between 
videogame playing and children creativity. Children have also been proposed to be part of the 
processes to design new technologies, in the roles of informants and design partners (Scaife & 
Rogers, 1998; Druin, 2002), and more recent work looked into the potential of children leading the 
process of design from initial problem formulation to design review and elaboration (Yip et al., 
2013). The possibility and effectiveness of children being expert evaluators using heuristic 
evaluation method has also been explored (Salian, Sim, & Read, 2013). As Read, (2015) argued, the 
motivation for the involvement of children as active participants and evaluators has been that there 
is a considerable distance between children and any (adult) expert  guessers , and children act in 
ways that could not have been predicted by an expert.  
In brief, even though there is a seeming tension between children having  fresh eyes  (less 
constrained by existing technologies) and their being digital natives, evidences in the literature 
show that the two may not be in conflict but could both boost the creativity of children in the 
domain of information technologies. Based on the reviewed literature we would expect that, when 
mobile services are concerned, the ideas coming from young children should be more creative than 
those generated by adults, therefore young children can be a valuable source of innovation. In this 
paper we focus on the creativity of young children aged from 7 to 12 years. According to (Piaget, 
1953), this is a homogeneous group in terms of their intellectual development. Young children in 
this age group are able to think abstractly and make rational judgments about concrete, observable 
phenomena. 
1.3.  Conceptualization of Creative Ideas 
Creativity is a multi-faceted, multi-disciplinary concept that is difficult to measure (Piffer, 2012). 
Over hundred definitions exist for creativity, spanning several disciplines (Hocevar & Bachelor, 
 
 
10 
1989). According to Sternberg (2006), a component of creativity is imaginative thinking, that is, the 
ability to see things in novel ways, to recognize patterns and make connections. Nijstad & Paulus 
(2003) described creativity as  the development of original ideas that are useful or influential . 
Rhodes (1961) suggested that creativity could be an attribute of a process, a product, a person or 
environmental press, so called four P s model of creativity.  
However Dean et al. (2006) argued that, to define idea creativity, it was helpful to differentiate it 
from the concept of creativity itself. Drawing upon MacCrimmon, Wagner, & Wagner (1994), they 
defined  a creative idea as a quality idea that is also novel. That is, it applies to the problem, is an 
effective and implementable solution, and is also novel . Based on a literature review of 51 studies 
on quality, novel and creative ideas, they summarized a conceptual framework of idea creativity as 
illustrated in Table 2. 
Table 2. Conceptualization of Idea Creativity (adapted from Dean et al. 2006) 
Dimensions 
Novelty 
Quality 
Constructs 
Originality 
Paradigm	  Relatedness 
Workability 
Relevance 
 
Novelty is considered to be the main dimension of creativity (Dean et al., 2006). A novel idea is 
rare, unusual, or uncommon (Connolly, Dalgleish, Kalverboer, Hopkins, & Geuze, 1993). 
According to this definition, the most novel idea is an idea that is totally unique; conversely, the 
least novel idea is the most common one (MacCrimmon et al., 1994). Dean et al., (2006) warned 
that when applying the framework, the novelty of any idea must be judged in relation to how 
 
 
11 
uncommon it is in the mind of the idea evaluator or how uncommon it is in the overall population of 
ideas. Novelty can be broken down into two constructs: originality and paradigm relatedness. Ideas 
are considered original when they are rare but also have the characteristic of being ingenious, 
imaginative or surprising. Idea originality ranges from those that are common and mundane to those 
that are rare and imaginative. Paradigm relatedness describes the transformation potential of ideas. 
It is the degree to which an idea relates to the currently prevailing paradigm, and it is closely related 
to the concepts of transformational and germinal.  
Based on this understanding, we can formulate the following hypotheses regarding the novelty 
dimension of idea creativity: 
H1: Mobile service ideas expressed by young children are more novel than those by adults. 
H1a: Mobile service ideas expressed by young children are more original than those by adults. 
H1b: Mobile service ideas expressed by young children are more transformational in terms of 
existing paradigm than those by adults. 
The second dimension of idea creativity is quality, which is further divided into workability and 
relevance. An idea is workable (or feasible) if it can be easily implemented and does not violate 
known constraints. An idea is relevant if it applies to the stated problem and will be effective at 
solving the problem. There is a third construct suggested by Dean et al. (2006), namely specificity. 
An idea is specific if it is clear and worked out in detail. We excluded the specificity construct in 
this study, since Dean et al. (2006) recommended that specificity was optional and should be 
measured only when it is a main focus of a study.  
Consequently, we formulate the following hypotheses regarding the quality dimension of idea 
creativity: 
H2: Mobile service ideas expressed by young children are of higher quality than those by adults. 
 
 
12 
H2a: Mobile service ideas expressed by young children are implemented more frequently than those 
by adults. 
H2b: Mobile service ideas expressed by young children are more relevant than those by adults. 
2.  Materials and Methods 
2.1.  Sample 
The research design has relied on a historical data set. In 2006, a group of researchers from the VTT 
Technical Research Centre of Finland launched a national research project called the Idea 
Movement (Leikas, 2007). They systematically collected innovative ideas of mobile services from 
the Finnish citizens through 31 workshops organized in the country in that year. The locations of 
the workshops included universities, schools, workplaces and even a shopping centre. 
The workshops were run in a consistent format, but the targeting participants were grouped by their 
ages. Therefore the workshops were run separately for children and adults. Each workshop was 
kicked off with a short introduction to scientific process and idea generation techniques, which was 
then followed by brainstorming sessions both individually and in groups. Each participant was 
asked to produce 20 ideas individually and then to form groups of 3-4 people per group. Each group 
was targeting at generating 100 ideas or more. The researchers acted as the facilitators of the 
workshops and encouraged the participants not to think about the technology, but to express their 
concrete needs, and to produce ideas even if they would feel them either  silly  or not realistic in 
their minds. The ideas were produced in a written format. For this reason, the writing ability of 
young children did most likely have impact on the extent of how the ideas were expressed. 
Regardless, young children wrote down their ideas independently without the assistance from the 
adults present at the workshops. 
 
 
13 
The ideas were generally 1 to 2 sentences in length, describing a mobile service idea, or expressing 
a need that one thinks could be fulfilled utilizing mobile technology. Two examples of the ideas are: 
 The camera of the phone would have a recognition feature which would recognize persons in 
photos.  (Child idea) 
 A composing service which lets one to inspect song patterns that are based on different 
mathematical forms.  (Adult idea) 
In total, 41,000 ideas were collected from 2,150 participants, the majority of whom were university 
students, school children and elderly people. Among the total ideas, 1,800 were from young 
children aged 7 to 12 years, and 25,300 were from adults aged 17 to 50 years.  
In order to decide the meaningful sample sizes for comparing the ideas of young children and 
adults, we consulted several studies in statistics and organizational research. We set a value of .05 
as margin error, as suggested in the guidelines by Bartlett, Kotrlik, & Higgins (2001) and Krejcie & 
Morgan (1969). We adopted the most conservative value for variance estimation of .50, that is the 
one usually found for dichotomous variables and will also produce the maximum sample size 
(Bartlett et al., 2001). Subsequently by employing the Cochran (1977) formula for sample size 
estimation, we calculated that for a .95 confidence level we needed at least sample size of N=384. 
On the other hand, the application of a simplified formula from Yamane (1967), which took into 
account the population size as well, gave us the sample size value  N=395. That is, any sample size 
between 384 and 395 was sufficient for our scope. As a result, we opted to randomly select 400 
distinct ideas from the idea set of young children (7-12 years old) and 400 distinct ideas from that of 
adults (17-50 years old). Our two samples can be freely accessed online1.

2.2.   Idea Creativity Assessment  
Two independent raters evaluated the creativity of each idea in each sample by employing the 
framework described in the previous section (as shown in Table 2). Both judges were adult mobile 
service users and had years of experience with mobile devices. One of the judges had six years 
experience in mobile service development and was an early adopter of mobile devices. The other 
rater was a researcher on open innovation and creativity in information systems. Before the rating, 
the judges were trained on the definition and understanding of the idea creativity concept and 
measurement scales. The judges were blind to the sources of the ideas, which were ungrouped and 
randomized. 
2.2.1.   Novelty assessment 
The two constructs of novelty, originality and paradigm relatedness, were measured with a Likert 
scale from 1 to 5. A score of 1 was assigned to least original or least influential. A score of 5 
represented the other extremes. The detailed scale descriptions can be seen in Table 3. Following 
the recommendation of Dean et al. (2006), the novelty score was calculated as the sum of originality 
and paradigm relatedness, thus ranging in the interval [2,10].

All ideas were generated and collected in 2006. Therefore, the novelty assessment was challenging 
for the present study. To address this issue, we selected two best-selling mobile phones in 20062: 
Nokia 16003 (130 million sold, see Additional File 1 for its main characteristics) and Nokia 60704 
(50 million sold).  Each rater studied the specifications of each phone to have a clear presentation of 
what mobile functionalities and services were available at that time. While Nokia had published 
smartphones already in 2005 (E61) and in 2006 (N95), they were not in a widespread use at the 
time when the data was collected. 
2.2.2.   Quality assessment 
Quality was composed of two constructs: workability and relevance. In terms of workability, the 
employed data set granted a unique opportunity to go beyond a simple speculation. We could 
investigate if these ideas were actually implemented after they have been generated in 2006. Any 
idea that has been developed, produced and marketed in at least some part of the world was 
 
 
16 
considered implemented, therefore workable. On the other hand, ideas that had not been turned into 
mobile services or apps at all or that were in development but had not been marketed were 
considered not implemented, therefore not workable. Evaluated in this way, 1/0 dichotomous scores 
were used. In order to see whether an idea has been implemented or not, information on software, 
hardware, or service that would match the idea were searched through various online channels. The 
complete procedure of the workability assessment that we employed is available in Additional File 
2. 
Relevance was also assessed using the dichotomous scores, to enable the aggregation to the higher 
quality dimension. A score of 1 meant that an idea was a relevant mobile idea, 0 otherwise. In order 
to determine if an idea was a relevant mobile service idea, we employed the category list of mobile 
services (as shown in Table 1). If an idea could be put into the listed categories, it was considered a 
relevant idea. Otherwise, the idea was considered not relevant. It is worth noting that the ideas that 
indicate new but un-named types of mobile service were considered relevant and classified under 
the category  Other mobile service ideas .  
The quality score was calculated as the sum of relevance and workability, within the [0,2] score 
range. It is worth mentioning that, due to the different scales used to measure novelty and quality, 
we could not aggregate the novelty and quality dimensions as a single creativity score in this study. 
This is a trade-off we decided to make in order to benefit from the historical nature of the data that 
allowed us to investigate the actual implementation of these mobile ideas.

Recalling that the score range of the two constructs is [1,5], with respect to both originality and 
paradigm relatedness, the young children sample presented higher values for the mean and the 
average rating of the ideas. Additionally, the mean and the median of the adults sample were less 
than 3, which is the central value of the rating scale. It appeared that the young children on average 
were able to provide sufficiently original and related ideas, whereas the adults could not. 
 
 
18 
In Figure 1 and Figure 2, the boxplots of originality and paradigm relatedness show strong 
differences between the two samples. Regarding originality (Figure 1), the distribution of the 
averaged scores of the young children s ideas is noticeably greater than that of the adults  ideas. 
The first quartile of the children sample   i.e., 3 - is greater than the third quartile of the adults 
sample - i.e., 2.5. Additionally, the children s median value corresponds to the third quartile value 
of 3.5 and is greater than the adults  median value, by 1.5 units. It should be noted that the values of 
the outliers in Figure 1 and Figure 2 fall outside 1.5 times the interquartile range and are therefore 
meaningless in our context. However, it is interesting to notice that 45 ideas from the children 
sample were rated higher than 4 on average whereas only 2 ideas from the adults sample were rated 
higher than 4 on average. 
For the paradigm relatedness construct in Figure 2, the distribution of the averaged scores of the 
children s ideas appears to be greater than that of the adults  ideas. The first quartile of the children 
sample and the third quartile of the adults sample have the same value of 3.5. The median of the 
children s ideas is greater than that of the adults  ideas by 1 unit.  
Recalling the score range [2,10] for the novelty dimension, we see in Table 4 that the children 
sample outperforms the adults one. The mean and the median values of the children sample, both 
6.50, are greater than those of the adults sample, which are 4.39 and 4.50 respectively. As shown in 
the boxplots of Figure 3, the data distribution seems greater for the children sample. The first 
quartile of the children sample is equal to the third quartile of the adults sample   i.e., 5.50. 
3.1.2.   Hypotheses Testing 
The hypotheses related to novelty (H1, H1a, and H1b) were implemented as tests for differences 
between groups. A series of Shapiro-Wilk tests on the samples showed strong evidence for non-
normality (p-value < 0.0001 for the two groups, for all the three hypotheses testing). Therefore, the 
 
 
19 
hypotheses were tested with a series of one-tailed Wilcoxon signed rank tests. Table 5 summarizes 
the tests.

At a 0.0001 significance level, there was support to H1a and H1b, which state that the mobile service 
ideas expressed by young children are more original and paradigm changing than those by adults. 
Finally, at the same significance level, the results also show the evidence for a higher novelty level 
for the children s ideas with respect to the adults  ideas (H1). 
3.2.  Idea Quality

workability.

Recalling that the constructs relevance and workability are binary in the interval [0,1], the two 
samples provide similar values for the relevance. The mean value was 0.98 for the children sample 
and 0.96 for the adults one, while the median was 1 for both. Regarding workability, a larger 
difference between the children sample and the adults one was observed. Although the median was 
the same for both groups   i.e., 1.00   the children sample had an average value for workability 
higher by 0.12 units, whereas the difference in the standard deviations was 0.07. It appeared that the 
children s ideas on average are more often implemented than the adults  ideas. However, no 
difference in the relevance of the two groups was noticeable.  
A total of 393 over 400 ideas (98%) were evaluated as relevant from the children sample, while 383 
over 400 (96%) were considered relevant from the adults sample. Thus, the children provided a 
slightly higher number of relevant ideas, an increment of 2%. 
 
 
21 
Out of 400 ideas from the children sample, a total of 324 (81%) have been developed in the past 
years. On the other hand, from the 400 adults  ideas, 276 (69%) have been implemented. Thus, the 
children sample presented 12% more workable ideas.  
3.2.2.   Hypotheses Testing 
Both relevance and workability constructs followed binomial distribution, because their values 
represent the number of successes in a sample. Therefore, we tested the one-tailed hypotheses (H2, 
H2a, H2b) with a Chi-squared test for proportions of two independent samples. The proportions to be 
tested were the ones mentioned in the previous sub-section. The hypotheses tests are summarized in

With a p-value less than 0.0001, we found significant evidence for the hypothesis that the children s 
ideas are more workable than the adults  ideas (H2a). With a p-value smaller than 0.05, we found 
significant support for the hypothesis that the children s ideas are more relevant than the adults  
ideas (H2b). Finally, with a p-value smaller than 0.0001, we found significant evidence to support 
the hypothesis that the children s mobile service ideas have higher quality than the adults  ones 
(H2).

4.  Discussion 
We hypothesized that the mobile service ideas expressed by young children aged 7 to 12 years are 
more novel (H1) and of higher quality (H2) than those by the adults aged 17 to 50. The results of our 
study support the two higher-level hypotheses. The general perception suggested by the literature 
was that the ideas from children are wilder and less realistic therefore less relevant and workable 
than those of adults. However, our findings empirically demonstrate that this may not be the case 
for the mobile services domain. 
In terms of the two constructs of idea novelty, namely originality and paradigm relatedness, our 
study supports the two hypotheses H1a and H1b, and provided significant evidence that children s 
ideas are more original and transformational in terms of existing paradigm than those by adults. 
Therefore, our study supports the creativity literature which claims that children are more creative 
than adults (Land & Jarman, 1993; Vint, 2005) when creative outcomes are concerned. It also 
provides further evidence that, even though today s young children are increasingly familiar with 
and confident in using information technologies, unlike adults, they could still keep their  fresh 
eyes  and open minds when imagining future digital products and services. The reason behind this 
could be that young children aged 7 to 12 years are in the intellectual development phase, and their 
minds are still forming and naturally more open than those of adults (Vint, 2005). However, as it is 
demonstrated, the  window of opportunity  closes very quickly and they lose their creativity 
dramatically when they grow up. We should either utilize this source of creativity in time or we 
need to reflect on and react accordingly to enable children to preserve or adults to  re-learn  
creativity.          
Regarding the two constructs of idea quality, our results support H2a and found significant evidence 
that the mobile service ideas expressed by children are implemented more frequently, i.e., they are 
more workable. In the study of Alahuhta, Abrahamsson, & Nummiaho (2008) it was claimed that 
 
 
23 
95% of adults  ideas could be implemented. Our study found instead that the percentage of 
implemented adults  ideas was 69%, which is 26% lower than predicted. We also found significant 
support to H2b, which shows that children s ideas are more relevant than those of adults. The results 
regarding workability and relevance are surprising in the sense that the intuitive expectation would 
be on the contrary. One would think the ideas from children are less relevant and workable or at 
least there shouldn t be significant difference between the two age groups. 
As part of the relevance analysis, this study classified the children s ideas using the list of 
categories from Alahuhta, Abrahamsson, & Nummiaho (2008) (as shown in Table 1), and 
calculated the percentages of each category (see Additional File 4). We compared the percentages 
of our analysis of the children s ideas to that of the adults  ideas presented in (Alahuhta et al., 
2008). We found that the category with the largest percentage in the children s sample was  Other 
mobile service ideas  (45.5%), which indicates that the ideas from children are more difficult to be 
classified under existing categories, therefore, more  out of the box . In comparison, the ideas from 
adults categorized under this category are 24% of the total adults ideas analyzed in Alahuhta, 
Abrahamsson, & Nummiaho, (2008). 
4.1.  Limitations of the study 
Several limitations, most of which are related to the samples, may threaten the validity of our study. 
Firstly, there was no detailed demographic data available for the original ideas collected in 2006. 
We could not know about the children and adults behind these ideas more than their ages and that 
they are from Finland. This is a threat to generalize our findings to children and adults of other 
nations. However, Finland is an advanced country in terms of mobile technologies, therefore it can 
be argued that its population is a good representative of current and potential mobile users. 
Additionally, we could not know exactly how many ideas were generated by the same persons. 
 
 
24 
However, since the focus of our study is idea creativity rather than person creativity, the unit 
analysis is idea, not the person. Therefore, the lack of the demographic data does not present a 
serious threat, even though the availability of this data would help a better understanding of the 
generalizability of the results to a larger population. 
Another limitation is that in this study we did not include another age group of children from 13 to 
16 years old, which is considered teenager group. Although their ideas are also interesting to 
explore and a comparison could be made between them and the other two age groups, the group was 
excluded from the investigation. The literature review precisely indicated young children (7-12) as a 
very creative group yet the most neglected one, mostly due to their lack of purchasing power and 
the traditional beliefs that relegate adults as  all-knowing  and young children as  all-learning  
(Druin, 2002). Meanwhile, the creativity of children has been shown to dramatically decrease when 
they become teenagers ((Land & Jarman, 1993), as cited by (Vint, 2005)). We were mainly 
interested in studying the extremely young children as source of creative mobile service ideas. For 
the same reason, we didn t further divide the adult group into more fine-grained groups. Future 
studies can build on top of our findings, including the teenager group or focusing on the comparison 
of children s ideas with those from a sub-group of adults (e.g., from 17 to 25, 25 to 35, etc.). 
Finally, due to the research design choice, we could not aggregate novelty and quality scores to a 
final creativity score for the evaluated ideas. Therefore, our claim that the mobile service ideas 
expressed by young children (7-12 years old) are more creative than those of adults might be 
limited. On the other hand, the construct of creativity is expressed in our adopted four sub-
hypotheses and measures, which all were empirically proved to be significantly in favor of young 
children.

5.  Conclusions 
Innovation is a key success factor in any high technology sector, including the mobile service 
domain. Creative ideas are the first step of innovative products and services. Existing customers, 
especially lead users, are considered the main sources of creative ideas. However, their creativity is 
constrained by the available technologies and their life experiences. One potential source of creative 
ideas, which is somehow overlooked, is young children. This led us to study young children (aged 
7-12) as another potential source for creative mobile service ideas. Year 2007 saw the introduction 
of smartphones, the most significant change to the mobile service domain.  A collection of more 
than 41,000 mobile ideas collected in 2006 granted us a unique opportunity to study the potential of 
children as the source of creative mobile service ideas. In order to understand if the mobile service 
ideas expressed by young children are more creative than those by adults, we randomly selected two 
samples from the idea database of a Finnish research project. One sample was a collection of ideas 
from young children aged 7 to 12, the other from adults (aged 17-50). We evaluated them using a 
creativity framework distilled from the literature. The results showed that the mobile service ideas 
from young children are more novel and have higher quality than those from adults. 
The paper offers several interesting findings that would be useful for creativity research as well as 
mobile service providing companies and designers. The theoretical contribution of our study lies in 
the six hypotheses, which our study supported significantly. They add to the body of knowledge of 
creativity study, especially regarding the idea creativity of younger age group, i.e., the  digital 
natives . The practical implication of our study is that it indicates a new and valuable source for the 
companies that seek for creative ideas for innovative products and services. Even though the cost of 
collecting ideas from young children is yet to be better understood, we expect that it should not be 
more costly than from the adults since the ideas in our samples were collected in the same manner. 
 
 
26 
Several future studies can be derived from our study. Since in this study the analysis was at the idea 
level, future studies can analyze the creativity at the person level in terms of mobile service ideas. 
Future studies can bring in more angles as well, such as the time of implementation, when an idea 
was implemented after it was uttered, and the popularity of an implemented service, indicated by its 
download rate.

Procedure to decide the implementation of ideas 
 
Step 1: Identification of impossible to implement ideas 
The ideas that were obviously impossible to implement, such as  a cell phone that invalidates 
gravity , were directly assigned score 0. 
Step 2: Grouping of ideas 
The remaining ideas were grouped under the categories of pure mobile application, mobile service 
that needs peripheral device and specific to the features of mobile phones.  
Step 3: Search implementation information 
For pure mobile application ideas we first went on the Apple App Store, the Android Market (now 
Google Play), and Nokia Ovi Store to see if any application indicated by an idea that might have 
been developed was there. If the application was not found on any of these platforms, we then went 
on to try to find it on other types of websites. If this search yielded no results, we would start 
searching for any type of papers or other publication of possible applications that were still in 
development, or that were only released in limited regions. This and the other searches were done 
very similarly through various search engines across the Internet, including Google, Yahoo!, Bing, 
Baidu, Sogou, and Yandex. 
For the ideas that require peripheral devices, we went on the websites of various producers for 
iPhone peripherals and other brands (such as LG and Samsung), and then resorted on third-party 
websites (such as Griffin technology2 and Hammacher3), if nothing was found on the phone

manufacturers website. If third-party peripheral developer websites did not give us any results, we 
would go on and try to find more unconventional places where such an idea might have been 
developed, this included various forums and personal websites of people that build their own 
peripherals for cell phones. 
For mobile phone specific ideas, we searched for existing phones and their features to see if they 
were compatible. If it was not found, we then searched various technology and cell-phone related 
news websites that might have articles or publications on ideas that were still in development or 
have been released in a limited quantity.

Examples of most and least novel ideas 
 
The table below contains a list of 3 most novel and 3 least novel ideas from the samples of the 
young children and adults. For the ideas of young children, the two raters gave the highest scores 
(5) to both originality and influence (paradigm breaking) to the three most novel ideas. In the case 
of adults, instead, none of the ideas was rated with score 5 on both originality and paradigm 
relatedness by both raters. We selected three ideas of the highest combined novelty scores (their 
originality scores range from 3 to 5, the paradigm relatedness scores from 4 to 5).
