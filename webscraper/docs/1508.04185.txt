ABSTRACT
Fashion is a multi-billion dollar industry with social and eco-
nomic implications worldwide. To gain popularity, brands
want to be represented by the top popular models. As new
faces are selected using stringent (and often criticized) aes-
thetic criteria, a priori predictions are made dif cult by infor-
mation cascades and other fundamental trend-setting mecha-
nisms. However, the increasing usage of social media within
and without the industry may be affecting this traditional sys-
tem. We therefore seek to understand the ingredients of suc-
cess of fashion models in the age of Instagram. Combin-
ing data from a comprehensive online fashion database and
the popular mobile image-sharing platform, we apply a ma-
chine learning framework to predict the tenure of a cohort of
new faces for the 2015 Spring / Summer season throughout
the subsequent 2015-16 Fall / Winter season. Our framework
successfully predicts most of the new popular models who
appeared in 2015. In particular, we  nd that a strong social
media presence may be more important than being under con-
tract with a top agency, or than the aesthetic standards sought
after by the industry.

INTRODUCTION
The success of cultural artifacts is characterized by inher-
ent unpredictability and inequality [40], posing fundamental
problems for a proper understanding of markets based on the
production of cultural goods. Fashion, and fashion model-
ing in particular, are typical examples [2, 32]. When trying
to cast a model for the upcoming seasons, a casting director
is faced with a seemingly impossible task: predicting whom,
out of the hundreds of new faces she may see at the go-see
calls, will become the top model of the next season.

Modeling has in fact a very special meaning in fashion, a
multi-billion dollar industry with strong social and economi-
cal implications worldwide [24]. Models play the main role
in advertisements and runways, which are, historically, the
main ways brands communicate with their customers. They
contribute to frame consumer experience and promote con-
sumption, as their attractiveness becomes associated to the
brands they work for [46]. This is especially true for luxury
goods, whose aesthetic value is more important than practi-
cal usage. Only those who appeal the aesthetic sensibility of
fashion designers stand chances to become popular [10].
Ethnographic studies show in fact that casting directors con-
sider both objective physical characteristics   such as body
size, height   and subjective considerations   the reputa-
tion of the agency representing the model   to be important
decision-making criteria for casting [33, 19, 32]. However,
the same studies also uncover how information cascades are
a critical part of what makes a model successful. Similarly to
the careers of scientists [34], fashion models also bene t from
strong cumulative advantage effects, by which small differ-
ences in prestige between competing individuals get ampli-
 ed, for example by means of word of mouth [39, 42, 19].
The job market for fashion castings has strong seasonal com-
ponents, revolving around week-long trend-setting industry
events ( Fashion Weeks ), during which a dense calendar of
shows is organized in various locations in a major city. The
four most prominent Fashion Weeks worldwide take place
twice a year and, as of 2015, are hosted in the cities of New
York, London, Paris, and Milan. These events facilitate net-
working and information sharing, and are seen as a crucial
part of the process by which the fashion industry collectively
decides what will be the new trends and the next top models.
Social media and mobile image-sharing platforms, Instagram
in particular, are revolutionizing the fashion industry world-
wide, as interest toward new trends, designers, and products
increasingly unfolds online [25, 7, 26]. This has obvious im-
plications on the job of fashion models too. Traditionally,
models were not meant to interact directly with their cus-
tomers [33]. It is instead now customary for spectators to use
Instagram to upload photos or videos during runways events.
This, in turn, has been argued to in uence the way fashion de-
signers design, shoot, and showcase their runways, especially
for the case of luxury brands [41]. Famous designers such as
Tommy Hil ger and Kenneth Cole have been reported to take
advantage of Instagram for customer engagement [14].
As social media become for fashion models a far more im-
portant showcase than magazines and billboards, we wonder
if popularity on such platforms can be used as a proxy to pre-
dict success, and seek to answer these research questions:
RQ 1. Given data about measurable physical and profes-
sional characteristics of a models, can we predict whether
she will be casted for the upcoming fashion season?
RQ 2. Does the addition of relevant signals of social media
activity improve the predictability of success of models?
We tackle these questions using a quantitative approach, with
a mix of exploratory statistics and machine learning experi-
ments. To rule out possible explanations in terms of cumula-
tive advantage [42], we focus on data about a group of new-
comers, who just started their career in the fashion world. As
a simple and reasonable measure of success, we employ the
number of catwalks a model walked.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. We give a brief
overview of the work related to predicting success in cultural
markets, and fashion in particular, in the next section. We
then describe the two datasets used in the study: the  new
faces  section of the Fashion Model Directory (FMD) web-
site1 and Instagram.2 We then present the main results of this
study. We start with a descriptive analysis of the FMD data,
and estimate the degree of association between the tenure of a
model and a number of standard industry metrics using a re-
gression framework. Finally, we describe the machine learn-
ing approach we employed, and the evaluation metrics used
to assess the quality of the predictions of our statistical frame-
work. The paper concludes describing the broader relevance
of our  ndings to the emerging  Science of Success  research
 eld, and potential future directions.
RELATED WORK
In this study we are looking at predicting popularity of fash-
ion models using data from social media activity. The study
of trends in cultural markets has a long-standing tradition [5],
and various researchers have exploited social data from a
wide range of backgrounds. For example, Asur and Huber-
man [4, 3] used Twitter data to predict the box-of ce per-
formance of newly-released blockbuster movies, and later
Mesty an et al. [35] improved these results using data from
Wikipedia. Ferrara et al. [12, 13, 23] studied the emergence
of information trends in social media settings, and the rise to
popularity of Instagram users in photography contexts [11].
In contrast,
it is worth noting
that practical application of trend-detection technologies has
started to become possible only in recent years, thanks to
the increasing availability of online user-generated data about
fashion apparel trends [30, 29, 31, 20].
Instagram was the platform selected in our study. It is a mo-
bile image-sharing service that specializes in instant commu-
nication of trends and visual information in general [11], in
a way similar to Twitter, Pinterest, and Flickr. Besides the
detection of trends, a wide range of aspects related to image

sharing have received attention from the research community,
such as depression and online behavior [1, 43], situated usage
in museums [21, 44], or organization of information through
tags [37, 27, 18].
METHODS
Fashion Model Directory
We collected data from the Fashion Model Directory (FMD)
website, one of the largest fashion databases of professional
female fashion models [45]. Figure 1 shows the pro le of one
of the fashion models on FMD as an example. As can be seen
from the  gure, FMD pro les, similarly to a r esum e, provide
a mix of biographical, physical, and professional experience
information, notably casting agencies and walked runways.
While the database claims to include pro les for over 10,000
models, our analysis focuses only on its recent additions,
which are listed under the category  New Faces . We col-
lected our dataset in December 2014,  nding N = 431 new
faces for the 2015 Spring / Summer (S / S) season.
For each model the FMD data thus consists of the follow-
ing attributes: name, hair color, eye color, height, hip size,
dress size, waist size, shoes size, list of agencies, national-
ity, and details about all runways the model walked on (year,
season, and city). We discarded the data about hair and eye
color, as the color coding was not reliable enough to allow for
a meaningful characterization of these features. For similar

Table 1: New faces of the 2015 S / S season under contract
with at least one top agency and their presence on Instagram.
Instagram
We collected data about the social media presence of our
FMD new faces using Instagram. We found Ni = 253 In-
stagram accounts (59%), accounting for Wi = 1181 runway
walks (4.67 walks per model on average). Models under
contract with a top agency are more represented on Insta-
gram (65%) than those with a non-top agency (41%), and no
agency at all (40%), see Table 1.
Using the media endpoint of the Instagram API, we collected
all media posted by any FMD new face in the three-month
period before September 4th, 2014, the beginning of the New
York Fashion Week. Metadata of each posted media include
the number of likes and comments, as well as the the metadata
of the  rst 125 likes of each post (e.g., time stamp of the like,
name of the liking user, etc.). We then computed the mini-
mum, maximum, median, and average number of likes and
comments of all posts uploaded by each new face, as well as
the number of posts during the period, for the three months
before and after the fashion week events. Similarly to the
FMD data, all variables were standardized before using them
in regressions.
Sentiment Analysis
We supplement the analysis of social media activity with sen-
timent analysis. To do so, we selected only comments writ-
ten in English. Language was detected using a simple Naive
Bayes classi er [36]. We extracted the comments on posts
uploaded before the Fashion Week season, and calculated the
average sentiment score of each model using Vader, a state-
of-the-art, rule-based algorithm [22]. We included only those
models who received at least one comment written in English
to any of their posts,  nding a subset of Ns = 198 models,
who account for Ws = 1052 runway walks (5.31 walks per
model on average). Vader is designed to deal with social me-
dia data, as it is based on a manually-de ned vocabulary that
encodes grammatical and syntactical conventions common to
online documents.
It is capable of capturing sentiment in-
tensity with an accuracy of 84%, which outperforms other
algorithms as well as individual human raters.
Predictive classi cation of success
To forecast success within the new faces cohort, we per-
formed a binary classi cation exercise. Since most models
in the cohort did not walk any runway, to avoid further class
imbalance we consider two classes: models with zero walks
(unpopular) and models with one or more walks (popular).
To learn the predictive score distributions, we applied three
widely-used machine learning algorithms, based on ensemble
methods and boosting: Decision Tree (DT) (baseline), Ran-
dom Forest (RF) [6], and AdaBoost (AB) [16]. We used the

reasons, we also discarded nationality information. All body
sizes (height, hips, dress, waist, shoes) were converted in the
metric system. For shoe size we used the Paris point units sys-
tem. Furthermore, the data were cleaned, substituting, in two
cases where the data about shoe and waist size were missing,
the missing values with the group average. Before running
regressions, any non-categorical variable was also centered
around the mean and standardized.
To account only for a homogeneous set of runway expe-
riences, we considered only runways occurred during the
fashion weeks for the 2015 S / S season in New York, Lon-
don, Paris, and Milan. These occurred during the period
of September 2014 and were the most recent major fashion
weeks at the time of our data collection (December 2014).
We found that, collectively, the new faces in our sample had
performed W = 1402 runway walks (3.25 walks per model
on average) for B = 313 distinct branded runway events.
Finally, we annotated each agency to re ect its reputation in
the fashion industry. We use a simple binary classi cation
system, by which high-prestige agencies are assigned to the
 top agency  category. Since FMD does not provide this in-
formation, we retrieved a list of all top agencies from another
online fashion database, Models.com,3 which collects experts
knowledge to determine the reputation and in uence of cast-
ing agencies. As a result, 329 out of 431 models were hired
by at a least one top agency, 87 models were not hired by any
top agency, and 15 had no agency information in their pro le
(which could indicate that either the model was not using any
agency, or that the information was simply missing from the
database; see Table 1).
The majority of new models did not perform even a single
runway during the four fashion weeks in September 2014;
only around 24% of models (102 out of 431) performed at
least one runway, with a small minority having participated
to several runways (see Figure 2). This is not surprising, and
further suggests that there exists a strong popularity bias in
castings, in line with previous work [19].

implementations of scikit-learn [38], optimally tuning the pa-
rameters as follows: entropy is used to measure the quality
of the decision splits; all statistical models employ 25 esti-
mators; DT and RF have a pruning setting of max-depth to 5,
and RF adopts a maximum of 5 features. This framework al-
lows us to evaluate the forecasting power of the various sets of
features presented above using standard performance metrics,
such as AUROC (Area Under the Receiver Operating Char-
acteristic curve), and accuracy scores. We report results ob-
tained by averaging one thousands iterations of k-Fold Cross
Validation (k = 5) in which 80% of data is used to train the
statistical models and the remainder 20% is used for predic-
tion. The last experiment of this paper, however, represents a
 real  prediction task in which we train the machine learning
models with the previous fashion season (2015 S / S) data,
and use them to predict the upcoming 2015-16 Fall / Winter
(F / W) season.
RESULTS
Descriptive analysis
We  rst analyzed height, hips, dress, waist, and shoe size of
the new faces group and assessed whether there is any obvi-
ous association with the number of walked runways. Fig-
ures 3(a) (e) show the distribution of body size measure-
ments and, where available (Figures 3(a) (c)) how these fea-
tures compare to the US female population for the closest
age group (20 29 y.o. for height and waist size [17]; 18 25
y.o. for hip size [47]). Here the data have been plotted be-
fore rescaling. The variables are all distributed within narrow
ranges, following approximately normal distributions. Un-
surprisingly, even the shortest model in our dataset is much
taller than the US female average. In general, as far as body
measures are concerned, our group of new faces seems to rep-
resent a very biased sample of the general female population.
Table 2 reports standard descriptive statistics of the sample.
We study the association between body size measures and the
main dependent variable, the number of runways the models
walked prior to the 2015 S / S fashion week season, using a
regression framework.
Since our measure of success is based on the count of walked
runways, we used a Poisson regression model to estimate the
chances of walking a single runway as a function of various
regression features. We start by only considering physical at-
tributes as regressors. The results are reported in Table 4 (see
Model 1). The expected number of walked runways for the
baseline new face is 2.25. Height is positively associated to
increased chances of walking a runway   speci cally, 2.27
times for approximately each additional cm, relative to the
group average baseline. Larger dress, hips, and shoe sizes are
all negatively associated with the chances of walking a run-
way, while waist size seem to be not associated in either way.
In Table 3 we also report correlations between all body size
regressors, as a simple test for possible source of multi-
collinearity. We  nd that dress, waist, and hip size are pair-
wise correlated with each other, as well as shoe size with
height. All correlations appear to be of moderate entity.
Adding the information on agencies (see Model 2), we  nd
a strong association between having a top agency and the
number of walked runways: models with a top agency have,
everything else being equal, nearly ten times higher chances
(exp (2.29) = 9.87) of walking a runway, than their coun-
terparts represented by non-top agencies. The chances of
walking for models without a prestigious agency drop sub-
stantially, as the expected count for the baseline is now only
0.28 walks. This is consistent with previous research [19],
and highlights the role of agencies in setting fashion models
trends in the fashion industry.
We then focus on models with an Instagram account (Ni =
253) and assess how the average number of posted media,
received likes, and comments is associated to the count of
walked runways. Figures 3(g) (i) show distribution his-
tograms (log10-scaled) of these variables.
Model 3 and Model 4 replicate the above  ndings on the
subset of new faces with an Instagram account.
In partic-
ular, within this subset the gap between those with a top
agency and those without is even more marked. Adding the
Instagram-related variables does not change much the asso-
ciation with height, hip size, and agency. Instagram activity
seem to have mixed associations with runway walks. Ad-
ditional posts over the average activity yield a 15% higher
chances of walking a runway but, surprisingly, more likes
tend to lower the chances of walking a runway (about 10%
less). The average number of Instagram Likes is highly cor-
related with the average number of comments (r = 0.82)
yet it has a negligible correlation with the number of posts
(r = 0.15). The number of received comments does not seem
to be correlated with the number of posts (r = 0.00).
The overall picture does not change signi cantly when we
look at the sentiment expressed by Instagram users when
commenting on the media posted by our new faces (Model
6, 7, and 8 of Table 4). The sentiment itself appears to be
positively associated to better chances of walking a runway
(23% more), together with the overall number of comments.
Figure 3: Distribution of body size measures and Instagram activity of new faces of the 2015 S / S season (N = 431). Dashed
lines, where shown, indicate averages computed on the closest matching age group in the US female population.
Including the information about agency and all Instagram-
related variables yields better statistical models for both the
overall sample of new faces and those with an Instagram ac-
count, as shown by both the Akaike (AIC) and Bayesian In-
formation criterion (BIC) scores. This indicates that all vari-
ables potentially provide useful predictive signals. In the next
section we describe the results of the prediction tasks in de-
tail.
Forecasting success in fashion
For each classi cation algorithm (DT, RF, and AB) we
(i) with only
learned three distinct predictive models:
body size measures (height, hips, dress, waist, and shoes)
(BODY); (ii) with physical attributes and the binary infor-
mation about whether the fashion model has a top agencies
or not (BODY+AGENCY); and, (iii) with body size measures,
agency information, and Instagram-related signals  number
of posts, average number of likes and comments received 
(BODY+AGENCY+INSTA). For the latter statistical model, we
restrict the training data to use only the media posted in the
three months before the fashion week. As shown in Table 5,
and consistently with results from the previous section, when
trained on 2015 S / S runway walks data, social media fea-
tures improve accuracy of the statistical model. According to
t-tests, all improvements are statistically signi cant. We also
tried other statistical models [38] (SVM, Logistic Regression,
Naive Bayes, etc.): none yielded AUROCs or accuracy above
60%.
To test the actual forecasting power of our framework based
on the classi ers trained on the 2015 S / S data, we attempt
to predict the popularity labels for the next season, the 2015-
16 F / W Fashion Week, that is, on a completely separate test
set. To do so, we manually collected a new and more re-
cent dataset (May 2015) containing the new faces of the lat-
est fashion season, and up-to-date information about runways
performed during the 2015-16 F / W Fashion Week (February
12 March 11, 2015). We found 15 such new face pro les.
This set is roughly balanced (8 fashion models ran at least
one top walk, 7 did not appear in any of the four main events),
and each pro le links to an Instagram account, allowing us to
employ all predictive features (BODY+AGENCY+INSTA).
Social media features for the validation test set were built us-
ing the meta-data of media posted in the three months be-
fore the season only (November 12, 2014 to February 11,
2015). The results for the best predictive model, Random
Forest (RF), along with the true popularity labels (became
popular), are shown in Table 6. Random Forest scores an
AUROC performance above 81%: impressively, RF is able to
correctly predict 6 out of 8 fashion models who became popu-
lar during the 2015-16 F / W, using training data from the past
season only. Random Forest also successfully identi ed 6 of
the 7 fashion models who did not perform in any top event.
The confusion matrix in Fig. 4 summarizes these results.

Random Forest to mistake. Fashion Model 10, the only false
positive, on the other hand shows very high social media en-
gagement levels, yet did not perform in any top runway dur-
ing the 2015-16 F / W season. The FMD pro le pictures of
the six models whose success was correctly predicted by our
framework are shown in Figure 5.
To understand which features contribute most to the predic-
tive signal we compute feature importance. The contribution
of each feature is here calculated as information gain. The
results for Random Forest (RF) are shown in Table 7. For
prediction purposes, we note how the three social media ac-
tivity features contribute as much as having optimal physi-
cal attributes and more than being under contract with a top
agency. The top 3 features used by RF are: (i) Instagram
#Likes, (ii) Height, and (iii) #Posts. Similar results hold for
other classi ers.
DISCUSSION
Social media are increasingly used as sensors of social collec-
tive phenomena [4, 13]. Increasingly, the usage of social data,
often in conjunction with other data sources, proves crucial to
be able to represent real-world events, trends, information dif-
fusion, and social behavior. In this study we were concerned
with understanding whether it is possible to predict fashion
models popularity, complementing physical and professional
information with social data.
Our methodology has of course limitations, and we here re-
port few notable ones:

mance for the prediction task (2015-16 F / W Fashion Week).
The elements of success in fashion modeling
The analysis of the prediction task provides some interest-
ing insights: Fashion Models 11 and 13, although having top
agencies, did not rise to popularity; Fashion Model 5, how-
ever, became popular even without a top agency: both of
these dynamics have been correctly captured by our predic-
tion framework. It is worth considering when our framework
failed. Fashion Models 2 and 3 represent the two false neg-
atives: they both exhibit low social media activity, a signal
highly regarded by our predictor (see below), which induces

Table 6: Performance of our predictive models trained on 2015 S / S data, and tested on 15 new fashion models who appeared
in the 2015-16 F / W Fashion Week. Our best classi er, Random Forest, correctly predicts 6 out of 8 positive instances (became
popular), and 6 out of 7 negative ones (not becoming popular) yielding 80% accuracy and an AUROC score of 81.25%.

  All brands during the season are equally treated. Runways
of higher reputation brands, such as Herm`es or Chanel,
should be re ected with higher weights if compared to new
and relatively unpopular brands. We plan to incorporate
such prestige in future revisions of our statistical models,
and observe what effects this yields.
  Our measure of popularity only takes into account the num-
ber of runways walked. This neglects several aspects of
popularity within the fashion industry, such as appearances
on magazines and social events. We plan to incorporate
further dimensions of success in future work, to determine
how these additional dimensions play along with the suc-
cess measured by runways.
  Our  real  prediction task is tested on a very small dataset
containing only 15 fashion models appeared during the
2015-16 F / W Fashion Week: although this limitation is
due to the intrinsic scale of fashion events and to our data
sources, more data in the future will be needed to deter-
mine the general performance of our framework.
  Our study is con ned to one single online platform, Insta-
gram: its peculiar characteristics (e.g., the mobile-oriented
nature) might affect the dynamics of content generation
and perceived popularity, as opposed to other platforms
with different usage purposes, like information sharing
(Twitter [28]) or befriending activities (Facebook [9]).
  Finally, our study is limited to analyze only female fash-
ion, while man modeling is increasingly becoming more
mainstream.
It will be interesting to see, when data be-
come available, whether our results apply to the male fash-
ion modeling market as well.
CONCLUSIONS
The ingredients to career success oftentimes remain myste-
rious. In the fashion industry, style is often credited as that
ineffable quality all successful individuals have. The present
contribution shows how a number of seemingly disconnected
characteristics are actually tightly entangled: physical at-
tributes are required for inclusion in the modeling profession,
but do not suf ce. The professional contribution of trend-
setting top agencies play an equally important role. And, as
we  rst show in this paper, in the new era of social networks,
online presence helps succeed, as we see by the improvement
in the predictive power of our forecasting models.
We submit a few possible explanation to this observation:
in a world with limited attention [8], information cascades
and the wisdom of the collectives are precious indicators for
casting agencies, promoters, marketeers, agents, recruiters,
and the fashion industry in general. The response of the on-
line audience plays an increasingly important role in the of-
 ine fashion industry world: a rising star in the online world
will hardly be ignored, and will probably be noticed by a top
agency, facts that will enhance her likelihood to succeed. In
other words, buzz on social media is a proxy for the buzz in
the of ine world, and this reduces uncertainty on the part of
the industry.
Yet, it remains interesting that, in the regression models, in-
creased activity on social media had only a weak association
with heightened success (though on average fashion models
with an Instagram account tended also to have done more
shows). Perhaps, even these small differences have more
chances of getting ampli ed due to word of mouth and collec-
tive attention, so that social media may be just facilitating the
information cascades mentioned before. Lacking data on the
word of mouth among industry professionals, in this work we
did not investigate actual information cascades, but we be-
lieve that further research is needed to better elucidate this
point.
We also note how fashion modeling exhibits a strong winner-
takes-all component. In an industry that seems to be governed
by such a survival of the  ttest mechanism, the difference be-
tween performing a show in a premier venue or not becomes
crucial: while the majority of new faces will not appear in
any prestigious avenue, having even one single runway in one
such venue may decree the success of a new model, bring-

ing her visibility above that of 76% of her competitors.4 Our
analysis aimed at understanding the factors that play a role in
obtaining such popularity, including physical attributes, the
reputation of casting agencies, and the importance of social
media presence and reactions.
Regarding our exploratory analysis (cfr. Table 4), we  nd that
thinner and slender individuals are more likely to walk in run-
ways. Compared to the general population, models are often
singled out for their extremely skinny and tall looks. How-
ever, it is interesting that even among themselves, these pref-
erences   towards skinny and tall models   are still signi -
cantly related to the number of runways they can join. Beauty
is notoriously a hard-to-de ne quality and, in the case of the
fashion industry, largely a by-product of a collective effort,
rather than an inherent quality [32]. While beyond the scope
of the present work, an intriguing question that follows up
from it is whether Instagram and other social media are in-
deed changing the traditional notions of beauty.
Research on the fashion industry thus far has been largely
qualitative, relying on methods such as interviews with small
number of models and casting directors [33, 19]. To the best
of our knowledge, this is  rst time a large online fashion
database has been explored in a quantitative way, together
with data from online social activity. As the impact of so-
cial media   especially Instagram   becomes signi cant in
the fashion industry, predictive methods have the potential to
leverage collective attention and the wisdom of the broader
user population, which re ect some of the popularity of fash-
ion models, to predict their career success.
Fashion modeling is one of the best examples of a cultural
market, like music, art, and literature. In all these markets,
determining quality of cultural products is hard because of
inherent uncertainty, and thus market actors must rely on so-
cial conventions and buzz as a proxy for success. In the case
of fashion models, here we show that the buzz going on social
media (Instagram in this case) is a reliable predictor of early
career success. Our results are in line with previous work that
shows that social signals have a prominent role in determin-
ing success of cultural contents [40, 4], and so we can expect
that similar approaches to cultural predictions will work in
other markets too. Even scienti c production and the stock
market are, to some extent, ruled by prestige and buzz [34,
15]. Thus we expect that the essence of our  ndings might
inform cultural producers and scholars well beyond the mere
fashion industry.
In conclusion, computer-mediated collectives are increas-
ingly disrupting the way culture is consumed and produced.
Understanding how use of internet communication platforms
affects cultural production is just an instance of the study of
work in computer-mediated environments and an interesting
challenge for future research.
