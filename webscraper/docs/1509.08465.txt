How Many Political Parties Should Brazil Have?
A Data-driven Method to Assess and Reduce Fragmentation
in Multi-Party Political Systems
Pedro O.S. Vaz de Melo, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais
In June 2013, Brazil faced the largest and most signi cant mass protests in a generation. These were exacerbated by the
populations disenchantment towards its highly fragmented party system, which is composed by a very large number of
political parties. Under these circumstances, presidents are constrained by informal coalition governments, bringing very
harmful consequences to the country. In this work I propose ARRANGE, a dAta dRiven method foR Assessing and reduciNG
party fragmEntation in a country. ARRANGE uses as input the roll call data for congress votes on bills and amendments as
a proxy for political preferences and ideology. With that, ARRANGE  nds the minimum number of parties required to house
all congressmen without decreasing party discipline. When applied to Brazils historical roll call data, ARRANGE was able
to generate 23 distinct con gurations that, compared with the status quo, have (i) a signi cant smaller number of parties, (ii)
a higher discipline of partisans towards their parties and (iii) a more even distribution of partisans into parties. ARRANGE is
fast and parsimonious, relying on a single, intuitive parameter.
1. INTRODUCTION
In June 2013, Brazil faced the largest and most signi cant mass protests in a generation, comparable
in size to the protests that triggered the collapse of the military dictatorship in 1984 [1]. The 2013
protests had been exacerbated by the broader disenchantment of the population towards the party
system in Brazil [2]. Banners with sentences such as  no party represents me  or  we don t have a
party, we are Brazil!  were commonly seen among the protesters. In response to these protests, the
government proposed a program of political reform [1]. However, more than one year has passed
and very little has been done.
Why are people so unhappy with the Brazilian party system? To illustrate its incapability, con-
sider the following examples. 19 months before Rio de Janeiro stages South America s  rst Olympic
games, an Evangelical pastor without any link to sports was nominated as Brazil s new sports min-
ister. He replaced communist Aldo Rebelo, who oversaw preparations for the World Cup and was
highly criticized for subsidizing the construction of white-elephant football stadiums [3]. Aldo Re-
belo, who in 1994 proposed a bill that prohibits the adoption of any technological innovation in local,
state and federal agencies, is, ironically, Brazil s new minister of science and technology. Moreover,
in 2010 elections, Tiririca, a well known entertainer whose career began as a circus clown in Brazil,
was  rst elected to represent S ao Paulo in Congress, winning the most votes of any candidate in the
country with the slogans  It can t get any worse  and  What does a Congressman do? In fact, I do
not know, but vote for me and I will tell you .
One of the main causes of Brazil s political inef ciency is its highly fragmented party system [4].
This is a system with many political parties and with no one party being able to obtain an absolute
majority in the representative assembly. The more fragmented the party system is, the less likely
it is that the president s party will control a majority of seats in the legislature. Therefore, presi-
dents are usually forming informal coalition governments, needing to build cross-party coalitions to
implement most major policies [5]. Under these circumstances, many (if not most) deputies spend
the bulk of their time arranging jobs and pork-barrel projects for their constituents in exchange for
legislative support [6]. Also, parties rarely organize around national-level questions, which means
that Congress rarely deals with serious social and economic issues [6]. As a consequence, individ-
ualism, clientelism, and personalism, rather than programmatic appeals, dominate electoral cam-
paigns [6]. More generally, party system fragmentation impacts the electoral dynamic, the process
of coalition formation, governing, and ultimately, the survival of political systems in presidential
democracies [7]. In Brazil, party system fragmentation has reached one of the highest levels ever
found in the world [8; 9]. After 2014 elections, the number of parties represented in Congress grew
from 23 to 28.
A:2
Besides Brazil, many countries have party systems with high levels of fragmentation, such as
Bolivia, Bulgaria, Denmark, Ecuador, Finland, France, Guatemala, India, Israel, Italy, Netherlands
and Thailand [9]. In theory, the number of parties of a country can be explained by its electoral
and social structures [10; 11; 12]. With regard to the electoral structure, while plurality elections
favor two-party competition, proportional representation (PR) electoral systems create fragmented
party systems [13; 4]. Concerning the social structures, the more socially heterogeneous a country
is, the more electoral parties it will have [14; 15]. Social heterogeneity is measured either by the
number of linearly independent ideological dimensions (e.g. religious and socio-economic) being
discussed in the society or the number of social cleavages (e.g. centre-periphery and state-church)
a country has [10; 15]. Thus, is it possible to measure if a fragmented party system is a re ex of a
socially heterogeneous society? In this direction, how can we determine whether an electoral system
is optimally fragmented? And if it is not optimally fragmented, how can we optimize it?
To answer these questions, I propose ARRANGE, a dAta dRiven method foR Assessing and re-
duciNG party fragmEntation in a country. Inspired by the broad spectrum and advances of data
analysis methods [16; 17; 18; 19; 20; 21; 22; 23; 24; 25; 26; 27; 28; 29; 30], ARRANGE uses
as input the roll call data, i.e., the votes given by congressmen on bills and amendments, as a
proxy for political preferences and ideology. The idea, regularly employed by political scientists [24;
23], is that congressmen who give the same vote regularly share the same political ideology and,
therefore, should belong to the same party. Using this insight, ARRANGE reorganizes the party
system of a given country by trying to  nd the minimum amount of social cleavages that divides its
congressmen into coherent voting blocks, i.e., sets of congressmen whose members votes similarly.
These coherent voting blocks would be the new political parties of the analyzed country and would
allow us to assess its actual level of fragmentation. If ARRANGE divides the congressmen into a
much lower number of political parties than the actual number, then it is possible to conclude that
party fragmentation in this particular country is much higher than it should be. If this is the case,
ARRANGE immediately provides a new congressmen party con guration that both reduces the
country s level of party fragmentation and increases intra-party similarity, which could potentially
increase the ef ciency of the party system [8; 4; 5; 6]. To the best of my knowledge, this is the  rst
work that proposes a data-driven method to assess and potentially reduce the number of parties in
political systems. In summary, the main contributions of this paper are:
(1) A new problem is addressed: what is the minimum number of political parties a country should
have given the roll votes of its congressmen? Again, although party fragmentation has been
extensively studied in the literature, to the best of my knowledge, this is the  rst time roll call
data has been used to assess it.
(2) ARRANGE, a fast and parsimonious method that receives as input roll call data and outputs a
new party system con guration that potentially reduces its actual level of fragmentation.
(3) It is shown that Brazil has and had many ideologically redundant parties, i.e., parties that
are similar in the ideological space. Thus, if today Brazil has one of the highest levels of party
system fragmentation in the world (more than 20 parties), this work proves it can be much lower
(down to 5 parties).
2. FUNDAMENTALS AND RELATED WORK
The constant advancement of information systems allows, at a growing rate, more data to be stored
and generated from the most diverse situations. It is fascinating that, behind all these data, we
see the re ection of the environment itself. In order to  nd knowledge in this invaluable evolving
database, a growing number of data-driven methods are being proposed along various research ar-
eas. For instance, there are data-driven methods to predict hospital mortality from instance-based
patient data [16] and  u epidemics [31]. In the social sciences, Silva et. al. proposed two data-driven
methods to quantitatively characterize cultural behaviors of geographical regions[17; 18] and Park
et. al. [19] designed and evaluated a measure that captures diversity of musical tastes from social

media data. In economics, [22] proposed a data-driven approach to understand online consumer
behavior and engagement with brands. For the bene t of the industry sector, there are data-driven
methods to monitor industrial processes [21] and to assist the development and deployment of in-
telligent transportation systems [20]. The constant advancement of information systems allows, at a

stand online consumer behavior and engagement with brands. For the bene t of the industry sector,
there are data-driven methods to monitor industrial processes [21] and to assist the development and
deployment of intelligent transportation systems [20].
In the political sciences, data analysis methods from roll votes primarily focuses on the estimation
of cleavages and ideologies across congressmen and parties [32; 23; 24] to characterize and predict
legislative behavior [33; 34; 25]. Recently, with the advancement of political weblogs and online
social networks, researchers are also extracting political knowledge from user generated data on
the Web. There are studies that focus on mining political opinions [26] and pro les [27] from the
texts users post on social media applications. Others, such as [35], extract political opinions from
general texts, such as statement records of U.S. senators and online news. More recently, Leman
Akoglu [28] classi ed the political polarity of individuals using roll call votes of U.S. congressmen
and texts posted on political forums. The idea behind all these studies is that political preferences
tend to be stable over time and can be predicted accurately.
Still in the political sciences, the study of party systems is one of its largest sub- elds [11].
Within this sub- eld, since Duverger s seminal paper [13], many studies focused on predicting and
understanding the factors that determine the number of parties that compete in a given polity [36;
12; 37; 7; 9]. In summary, there are two lines of thought: one that emphasizes the role of electoral
laws in structuring coalition incentives, and another that emphasizes the importance of preexisting
social cleavages. Another fundamental problem in this sub- eld is to count the number of parties
by taking into account their relative size [38]. If, for instance, a party has a very small percentage of
seats in Congress (e.g. one seat of one thousand), then it should be counted accordingly. The metric
that considers this is called the effective number of parties. Conceptually, the effective number of
parties is simply the number of  viable  or  important  political parties in a party system that
includes parties of unequal sizes. Since Laakso and Taagepera s seminal work [38], several ways
of computing the effective number of parties were proposed [39; 40; 41]. The number of effective
parties is a frequent metric for assessing party system fragmentation in a country [9].
The high interest in these problems comes from the fact that the actual number of parties usually
determines the number of effective parties, or how fragmented a party system is [38]. Highly frag-
mented party systems can affect governance drastically [42]. The more fragmented the party system
is, the less likely it is that the president s party will control a majority of seats in the legislature.
Simone Bohn [7] reviewed the literature and concluded that party system fragmentation impacts
the electoral dynamic, the process of coalition formation, governing, and ultimately, the survival of
political systems in presidential democracies. Thus, in this paper, we measure party fragmentation
by counting both the actual and the effective number of parties.
Another crucial factor for governance is party discipline, i.e., the ability of a political party to get
its members to support the policies of their party leadership. Mainwaring and Shugart [5] assessed
the effects of this on the costs of governing. If parties are not disciplined, presidents will be forced
to rely on ad-hoc coalitions based on the distribution of patronage to individual legislators, which
raises the costs of governing and reduces policy coherence. Limongi and Figueiredo [8] argued that
 institutional engineering  should focus on electoral formulas that reduce party fragmentation and
A:4
increase party discipline. Brazil is a special case in politics for its high level of party fragmentation,
being consistently analyzed in the literature [43; 37; 8; 6; 42; 7]. Thus, using Brazil as the use case
makes this work specially challenging but rewarding.
Finally, it is important to emphasize that this work differs signi cantly from those that focus
on algorithms to  nd communities in networks [30; 44]. Although such algorithms could be ap-
plied here to detect communities of congressmen that are ideologically similar and, therefore, could
compose a political party, this is very different from our problem in two major aspects. First, here
our goal is to  nd the minimum number of communities (in our case, political parties), which is
an optimization problem not addressed by community detection algorithms, which usually aim to
maximize modularity [45] or any other cohesion metric [46]. Second, while traditional community
detection algorithms do not allow two disjoint subgraphs to be part of the same community, our
major constraint here is party discipline. Thus, here we allow two disjoint subgraphs (in our case,
two ideologically dissimilar groups of congressmen) to be part of the same community if the party
discipline constraint is satis ed. The comparison between the communities (political parties) gen-
erated by the proposed method and by the state of the art community detection algorithms is left for
future work.
3. DATA DESCRIPTION
All the data used in this work was collected from the Open Data (Dados Abertos) project of the
House of Representatives (or Chamber of Deputies) of Brazil. In total, I collected 744, 195 thou-
sand roll votes on 774 bills of 1, 582 thousand congressman that worked in the House of Represen-
tatives of Brazil from November, 4th, 1998 to December, 3rd, 2014. The reason for this particular
time interval is related to the purpose of this work. Since party discipline is a fundamental met-
ric of evaluation, I only collected the bills in which the party leaders declared the desired vote for
their fellow partisans. More than 95% of the votes given during this period had a declared party
leader vote. Moreover, note that congressmen vote for bills and their amendments. An amendment
is a proposition presented as ancillary to the bill, to amend its form or content. Thus, bills and
amendments compose a total of 2, 162 thousand propositions to be voted by the congressmen. Each
congressman may or may not agree with the vote of his/her party leader. There are, in total, 35, 216
thousand declared votes of the leaders of the 36 parties that had congressmen elected for the House
of Representatives during the analyzed period.
4. FORMAL DEFINITIONS
As discussed previously, reducing party fragmentation only makes sense if party discipline does
not decrease signi cantly. One way to measure the discipline of a congressman is to compute the
fraction of votes given by him/her through his political life that agreed with his/her party leader.
However, in Brazil it is common for congressmen to switch parties. Also, it is well known that some
parties demand (or inspire) higher levels of discipline than others [8]. Thus, instead of analyzing the
discipline of the whole political life of a congressman, I will analyze his/her discipline as a member
of a single party, i.e., a congressman may have different levels of discipline if he/she was member
of different parties during his/her political life. For simplicity, from now on I will assume that the
vote given by the leader of the party was given by the party itself, e.g., I will call party vote the vote
given by the leader of the party.
Thus, given the set of m congressmen U = {u1, u2, ..., um} and the N political parties that com-
pose the set P = {p1, p2, ...pN }, I de ne a partisan a := (u, p) as the tuple formed by a congress-
man u and a political party p. The set containing all M partisans is de ned as A = {a1, a2, ...aM }.
These partisans  job is to vote for the set B = {b1, b2, ..., bn} of n bills and amendments that
were put to vote in the House of Representatives during the analyzed period. From now on, I will
use the term propositions to refer to both bills and amendments. Since a partisan a had not nec-
essarily voted for all propositions, I de ne the set Ba   B as the set of propositions that were
voted by partisan a. I also de ne Ap as the set of partisans which are members of party p, i.e.,
Ap = {ai|ai := (u, p )   p  = p}.
A:5
Before the partisans give their votes for a given proposition b, their parties have to announce their
votes for b. Again, since a party p had not necessarily voted for all propositions, I de ne the set
Bp   B as the set of propositions that were voted by party p. For each proposition b   Bp of a
p associated with it. In the same way, for each proposition b    Ba
given party p, there is a vote vb
of a given partisan a, there is a vote vb 
a associated with it. Thus, a party p and a partisan a have,
respectively, a set of votes Vp and Va, where |Vp| = |Bp| and |Va| = |Ba|. The set of all votes given
by partisans and parties is simply V.
A vote vb
p given by party p on a proposition b may be of four types: Y (yes), N (no), O (obstruction)
and F (free), i.e., vb
p   {Y, N, O, F }. If the vote is Y (N ), the party approves (disapproves) the
proposition. If the vote is O, the party is trying to avoid the vote on the proposition, i.e., its partisans
are called to withdraw from the plenary. Finally, if the vote is F , its partisans are free to vote at
will. Similarly, a partisan a vote vb
a on a proposition b may be of three types: Y, N and O, i.e.,
a   {Y, N, O}. If the vote is Y (N ), the partisan approves (disapproves) the proposition. If the
vb
vote is O, the partisan withdrew from plenary.
In this work, the vote is the fundamental feature that determines a preference or ideology. Since
for all propositions in our dataset we have both the vote of the partisan and the party, here I de ne
a general function agrees(v1, v2) that receives two votes as input and outputs 1 if the votes are in
accordance or 0 otherwise. This function is de ned as:
agrees(v1, v2) = (cid:26)1
0
if v1 = v2 or v1 = F or v2 = F
otherwise.
(1)
Note that both v1 and v2 can be a vote of a partisan or a party. Also note that a F vote implies
accordance, since the party that gave that vote does not particularly care about its members votes.
Once we know how to compare votes, we can propose a way to compare the similarity sim(i, j)
between two vote sets Vi and Vj. It is given as:
sim(i, j) = Xb   Bi Bj
agrees(vb
i , vb
j )   |Bi   Bj| 1.
(2)
In summary, sim(i, j) sums all the votes in agreement between the vote sets Vi and Vj consid-
ering only the propositions that are in both sets. From Equation 2, we can de ne the three levels of
discipline that we will use throughout this paper. First, I de ne partisan discipline as the discipline
da p of a partisan a := (u, p) towards his/her party p, calculated as:
(3)
Second, I de ne party discipline as the discipline dp throughout all the votes that were given by
partisan members of the party p, calculated as:
da p = sim(a, p) | a := (u, p).
dp = Pa Ap
|Ba|   da p
Finally, I de ne overall discipline as the discipline d  throughout all the votes given in the House
of Representatives during the analyzed period, calculated as:
|Ba|
Pa Ap
d  = P[a:=(u,p)] A |Ba|   da p
P[a:=(u,p)] A |Ba|

for a list of all parties  names and their respective acronyms and sizes, in this case given by the size
of their Bps.
First, in Fig. 1, I show the historical participation of all parties in the House of Representatives
during the analyzed period. Party participation, which I will interchangeably call party size, is rep-
resented by the total number of propositions that were voted by the members of the party (horizontal
axis) and the total number of partisans that are and were members of the party (vertical axis). Ob-
serve the heterogeneity of this universe. From the three biggest parties (PMDB, PSDB and PT), with
hundreds of partisans who voted for thousands of propositions, to the two smallest ones (PSTU and
PMR), which together have only three partisans and forty one propositions, there are another 31
parties with very distinct levels of representation.
In order to verify if there is any correlation between participation and party discipline, I show in
Fig. 2, for each party p, the total number of votes given by partisans members of p (horizontal axis)
and the party discipline dp (vertical axis). Note that there is no apparent relationship between party
discipline and participation. In fact, the Pearson s correlation coef cient between party discipline
and the total number of votes is 0.24, but since the p   value for testing the hypothesis of no
correlation is 0.28, we cannot af rm the correlation is signi cant. Nevertheless, as already observed
by [8] using a smaller dataset, party discipline in Brazil is consistently high: no party has a historical
party discipline below 0.75 and only two parties have a  gure below 0.85.

In Fig. 3, we show the behavior of partisans discipline in Brazil during the analyzed period. First,
observe in Fig. 3a the Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) of all partisans  disciplines. Note
that the curve representing partisan discipline in Brazil is not very far away from the ideal curve,
where all partisans have discipline of 1.0. Thus, together with party discipline, partisan discipline is
also usually high in Brazil: only 6.3% of partisans have discipline lower or equal to 0.8. In Fig. 3b,
we plot the heatmap of partisans using their disciplines and total number of votes. The color bar at
the right indicates the number of partisans in a given area of the map. Observe that the vast majority
of partisans are located in the upper-right of the heatmap, i.e., they have given many votes and have
high partisan discipline. The Pearson s correlation coef cient of 0.03 and p  value = 0.23 indicate
that there is no correlation between discipline and participation.

Fig. 3. Partisan s discipline in Brazil.
Although party fragmentation in Brazil has reached one of the highest levels ever found in the
world [8; 9], we have seen that party and partisan discipline is consistently high. Does this mean
that the level of party fragmentation in Brazil is necessary? According to the seminal doctrine of
responsible party government [47], parties must differ suf ciently between themselves, providing
the electorate with a proper range of choice between alternative actions. Given that, I reformulate
the previous question: is the actual level of party fragmentation in Brazil a consequence of a high
number of suf ciently different parties?
Instead of performing a deep clustering analysis to answer this question, I will apply the Principal
Component Analysis (PCA) [48] technique to the matrix MVBR composed by the voting vectors
Vai of each partisan ai. PCA is a widely used statistical technique for unsupervised dimension
reduction. It transforms the data into a new coordinate system such that the greatest variance is
achieved by projecting the data into the  rst coordinate, namely principal component, the second
greatest variance is achieved by projecting into the second coordinate, the second component, and
so on. In order to draw more interesting conclusions from this analysis, I will also apply PCA to
the matrix MVU S composed by the voting vectors of the U.S. congressmen. For this, I will use the
same dataset used in [28], which consists of votes on 1655 bills in The House of Representatives
in years 2009-2010 by 451 representatives. In the matrices the Y ES votes are represented as 1, the
N O votes as  1, and the F , O and non-attendance as 0. To make the comparison more precise, I
will only use the votes in years 1999-2000 for constructing MVBR. This period comprises votes on
the 349 bills by 767 contemporary partisans of 18 parties in the  rst two years of president Cardoso
in power. Also, it is the two year period that gives the higher explained variance by the  rst two
components of the PCA.
In Fig. 4, I show the  rst two components of the PCA for both MVBR and MVU S , where each
point represents a congressman and each symbol represents a party. Observe that, for both USA and
Brazil the  rst two components explain a signi cant part of the variance: 67% and 53%, respectively.
However, only the USA PCA can visually divide the members of different parties. For Brazil, many
members of different (same) parties are located together (apart). This suggests that parties in Brazil
are not suf ciently different to justify one of the highest levels of party fragmentation ever found in
the world [8; 9].
6. THE ARRANGE METHOD
In this section I describe the method ARRANGE, which has, basically, two steps. First, based on the
votes given by party leaders, it tries to  nd pairs of parties that can be merged into one. The idea
is that parties that always give the same vote could be merged into a single party. Then, ARRANGE
attempts to assign partisans to new parties with the objective of minimizing the total number of

parties receiving partisans and preserving party discipline. Finally, I describe the quality outputs of
ARRANGE. Formally, the problem tackled by ARRANGE is:
PROBLEM 1. Given a set of parties P, a set of partisans A, a set of bills and amendments B and
the set of all votes given by parties and partisans V,  nd the minimum set of parties P   to which the
partisans in A can be assigned in a way that overall, party and partisan disciplines are maximized.
6.1. Merging Political Parties
In order to assign partisans to other parties, it is necessary to formally de ne the ways it can be done.
Thus, here I de ne an option as the descriptor of the party that can receive an external partisan as
member. More formally, given a partisan a := (u, pi), his/her current party pi, and his/her set
of propositions Ba, an option oa := (a, pj, sim(a, pj)) is a tuple composed by the partisan a, a
party pj 6= pi, and the similarity value sim(a, pj) between a and pj. More importantly, the option
oa = (a, pj, sim(a, pj)) exists if and only if Ba   Bpj , i.e., if the party pj has voted for all
propositions in Ba. The set Oa = {o1
a, ...} is composed by all the options of partisan a or, more
formally
a, o2
Oa = {[oa := (a := (u, pi), pj, sim(a, pj))] :
(6)
Moreover, an option oa := (a, pj, sim(a, pj)) of partisan a := (u, pi) is characterized as a good
option if sim(a, pj)   sim(a, pi). The set of good options O 
a for partisan a := (u, pi) is de ned
as
pi, pj   P   pj 6= pi   Ba   Bpj }.
O 
a = {[oa = (a := (u, pi), pj, sim(a, pj))]   Oa :
sim(a, pj)   sim(a, pi)}
In Fig. 5a, I show the histogram of the number of good options |O 
(7)
a| for all partisans of our
dataset. Consistent with the high levels of party and partisan discipline, observe that the majority of
partisans do not have a single good option, i.e., for 69% of the partisans there is no other party in
Brazil that offers more similar voting vectors. In fact, only   11% of the partisans have more than
three good options. This result suggests that it is very dif cult to reduce the number of parties in
Brazil by moving partisans from one party to another.
The main reason for the low number of good options is related to the short lifetime of many
parties in Brazil, as it can be observed in Fig. 1. Since an option exists if and only if the propositions
voted on by the partisan is a subset of the propositions voted on by the parties, many partisans with
a long history of votes cannot  nd options for them among the small parties. Thus, here I propose

a method for creating new parties by merging existing ones. The method is based on a simple idea:
if two parties are not contemporary or are contemporary, but all votes given by them are equal, then
these parties can be merged into a new one.
More formally, two parties pi and pj can be merged into a new party pi j if one of the two
conditions below is met:
  C1. Bpi   Bpj =  , i.e., parties pi and pj have not voted for a common proposition.
  C2.  b   Bpi   Bpj : vb
, i.e., parties pi and pj have given the same vote for all common
pi = vb
pj
propositions.
Given these two conditions, the  rst thing we have to do is  nd all pairs of parties to which at
least one of the two conditions is valid. Once this is done, for every pair of parties (p, q) that can be
merged, we create a merged party p q, for which the sets of propositions and votes are, respectively,
Bp q = Bp   Bq and Vp q = Vp   Vq. All parties created in this step are put in set P  . After this, we
repeat this process by verifying, for each party p   P  , all parties q   P that can be merged to p. We
merge p to q into p q as previously, but this time adding the merged parties to P   . Once this process
is done, we copy P    to P  , empty P   , and restart the process of  nding parties q   P eligible to be
merged to parties p   P  . The process ends when set P    does not receive a new merged party. All
parties p   P   that were not merged are put in the  nal set of merged parties p   P M . This whole
process is described in Algorithm 1.
Basically, what Algorithm 1 does is to  nd all possible k combinations (cid:0)N
1   k   N . It is well known that PN
k(cid:1) of set P for all
k(cid:1) = 2N   1, making the worst-case complexity for this
problem to be O(2N ). Nevertheless, in practice,  nding parties in P that can be merged with parties
in P   gets signi cantly harder as k increases, which, in practice, makes Algorithm 1 computationally
feasible for the problem in question. For the case of the 36 Brazilian parties, k went up to 6 and the
algorithm stopped, generating a set P M containing 95 parties, in which only 5 were not a product of
a merge, namely PDT, PMDB, PPS, PSDB and PT. Besides these, Algorithm 1 generated 12 parties
of size 2, 17 parties of size 3, 20 parties of size 4, 31 parties of size 5 and 10 parties of size 6.
k=1(cid:0)N
In Fig. 5b, I show the histogram of the number of good options |O 
a| for all partisans considering
the new set of merged parties P M . Observe that the number of partisans that do not have a single
good option dropped from   69% to   33%, all of them being members of the  ve parties that were
not merged. Moreover, the number of partisans that have more than three good options grew from
  12% to   47%. Thus, I conclude that merging parties signi cantly raises the chances of reducing
the number of parties in Brazil by moving partisans from one party to another without decreasing
party discipline.

6.2. Finding the Minimum Set
Now that most of the partisans have multiple good options, we can  nd ways of redistributing them
among the parties in P M . The idea in this redistribution is to  nd a set of parties P     P M that
has a lower cardinality than P, i.e., P     P M is a set of parties able to receive all partisans a   A
as members and the number of parties N   = |P  | in P   has to be lower than the actual number of
parties N = |P|. However, this has to be done cautiously, since there are two partially con icting
goals:
(1) Minimize the number of parties;
(2) Maximize party and partisan discipline.
These goals are con icting because minimizing the number of eligible parties to receive partisans
as members implies reducing the options for moving partisans and, as a consequence, the number
of good options. If a partisan does not have a good option, he/she is obliged to stay in his/her party
in order to not decrease his/her partisan discipline. On the other hand, maximizing the discipline
implies in maximizing the size of the set of good options and, therefore, the number of parties to be
considered has to be as high as possible.
In order to solve this con ict, I model this redistribution problem as a set cover problem
(SCP) [49]. SCP is a well studied problem for the  eld of approximation algorithms [50], being
also one of Karp s 21 NP-complete problems shown to be NP-complete. In summary, given a set of
elements {1, 2, ..., m} (called the universe) and a set S of n sets whose union equals the universe,
the SCP is to identify the smallest subset of S whose union equals the universe. More formally,
given a universe X and a family S of subsets of X , a cover is a subfamily C   S of sets whose
union is X .
In our case, the universe X is the set of partisans A and the family S of subsets of X is a family
of subsets of partisans AM
p   A where each subset AM
is composed by the partisans that are
p
eligible for moving to party p   P M . In order to build AM
p , it is necessary to recalculate the set of
options Oa and good options O 
a of each partisan a with respect to the merged parties in P M . Once
this is done, I de ne that each set AM
p is composed by all the partisans a that have a good option
oa := (a, p, sim(a, p)), i.e., AM
p = {a|a   A   p   P M     [oa := (a, p, sim(a, p))]   O 
Since this problem is NP-complete, I recur to a greedy algorithm to solve it. Literature shows
that the greedy algorithm is essentially the best possible polynomial time approximation algorithm
for set cover under plausible complexity assumptions [51]. The greedy algorithm for set covering
chooses sets according to one rule: at each stage, choose the set that contains the largest number
a}.

of uncovered elements. It can be shown [49] that this algorithm achieves an approximation ratio
of H(s), where s is the size of the set to be covered and H(n) is the n-th harmonic number:
For our speci c problem, this algorithm works as follows, being described in Algorithm 2. First,
we create two empty sets: P  , which will contain the  nal set of parties, and A , which receives
the covered partisans during the process. Then, while A  does not contain all partisans, we  nd the
p contains the largest number of uncovered partisans. Then, we add all
party p   P M to which AM
partisans a   AM

set of parties P  .
p to A , make AM
Note that so far this process guarantees that all partisans will, at least, have the same partisan
discipline as their actual ones, since only good options are used to build the sets AM
p , p   P M .
Nevertheless, it is possible that relaxing this constraint a little might diminish the total number of
parties that compose P   considerably. For instance, we may allow a partisan to be member of a
party if their similarity is at most 0.05 smaller than his/her similarity with his/her actual party. This
relaxation increases the number of partisans that are eligible to be member of other parties and,
therefore, may reduce the size of P  .
Thus, here I introduce the parameter  , which is the maximum allowed difference between the ac-
tual partisan discipline and the future one. We accommodate this in ARRANGE by simply changing
the way the set of good options is constructed. With the introduction of  , the set of good options
O 
a is de ned as:
O 
a = {[oa := (a := (u, pi), pj, sim(a, pj))]   Oa : pi   P  
pj   P M   sim(a, pj)   sim(a, pi)    }.
(8)
p for all p   P M considering  . These sets AM
In summary, after generating the set of merged parties P M using Algorithm 1, it is necessary to
p will contain all partisans that
create the sets AM
are eligible for being members of party p given  . This is done by selecting a value for   and then
running the procedure FIND of Algorithm 2. If, for instance,   = 0, then no partisans are allowed to
decrease their discipline when moving to a different party. On the other side, if   = 1, partisans are
allowed to be members of any party that voted for all propositions that they voted on, i.e., partisan
discipline is not a constraint. After running Algorithm 2, we will have a minimum set of parties P  
able to accommodate all partisans in A. Then, all we have to do is to assign a party p   P   to each
partisan a   A. This is done by selecting the option oa = (a := (u, pi), pj, sim(a, pj))   O 
a that
gives the maximum similarity value sim(a, pj) for all parties pj   P   and making pj the new party
of partisan a.

6.3. Quality Signals
The main goal of ARRANGE is to reduce party fragmentation by reducing the number of parties that
are able to accommodate all elected partisans. Thus, the main output of ARRANGE is N   (or |P  |).
Nevertheless, it is necessary to assess the quality of the cover P  , since it is essential to reduce
party fragmentation by achieving desirable levels of party and partisan discipline. But what are the
desirable levels of party and partisan discipline?
In Fig. 3a, I showed the CDF of the actual partisan discipline distribution during the analyzed
period. The most desirable, or ideal, partisan discipline distribution is shown as a dashed red line,
which represents the situation where all partisans have discipline of 1.0. Thus, a new partisan disci-
pline distribution, generated by Algorithm 2 with parameter   and de ned by the random variable
X , is considered desirable if its CDF FX  (x) is closer to the ideal than the actual one, de ned
by the random variable X0 and CDF FX0 (x). More formally, considering that the area under the
ideal CDF curve is 0 for both partisan and party discipline distributions, I propose the following
de nition:
De nition 6.1. A new discipline distribution de ned by random variable X  and its CDF
0 FX  (x) dx > 0,
FX  (x) is considered a desirable discipline distribution if R 1
where FX0 (x) is the CDF of the actual discipline distribution de ned by random variable X0.
0 FX0 (x) dx   R 1
In other words, if the area under FX  (x) is smaller than the area under FX0 (x), then X  represents
a desirable discipline distribution. Moreover, given that discipline ranges from 0 to 1, I propose the
following lemma:
LEMMA 6.2. Given a random variable X0 representing the actual discipline distribution and a
random variable X  representing a new discipline distribution, if the expected value EX  [x] of X  is
higher than the expected value EX0 [x] of X0, then X  represents a desirable discipline distribution.
0 1   FX (x) dx for a given random
variable X and CDF FX (x) [52]. Since discipline has values from 0 to 1, we can write EX [x] =
0 FX (x) dx = 1   EX [x] for discipline distributions. Then, we can replace
PROOF. From probability theory, we know that EX [x] = R  
1  R 1
0 FX (x) dx, or R 1
De nition 6.1 for 1   EX  [x] < 1   EX0 [x] or EX  [x] > EX0 [x].
Thus, now I can formally de ne three binary quality signals for the new partisan con guration
over the new set of parties P   generated by Algorithm 2 with parameter  . These signals indicate,
respectively, if the new partisan con guration has desirable levels of partisan, party and overall
discipline, and is de ned as:
  Q1: 1 if the overall discipline d 
  of the new con guration is greater than the overall discipline
  of the actual con guration; 0 otherwise. Recall that the overall discipline d  is de ned in
d0
Equation 5.
  Q2: 1 if the expected (average) partisan discipline of the new con guration EA
than the expected party discipline of the actual con guration EA
new partisan discipline distribution is a desirable partisan discipline distribution; 0 otherwise.
X  [x] is greater
X0 [x] or, in other words, if the

7. RESULTS
In this section I show the results for ARRANGE for a hundred equally distributed values of   between
0 and 1. From now on I will call a con guration c  the distribution of partisans among parties
generated by ARRANGE for a particular   value. Moreover, in all plots I will indicate whether the
quality signals described in previous section were 1 or 0. Namely, I will use yellow stars for results
where all quality signals were 1 (Q1 Q2  Q3), blue diamonds when only signals Q2 and Q3 were 1
A:14
(Q2   Q3), red circles when only signal Q3 was 1 and,  nally, green squares when all quality signal
were 0. In summary, ARRANGE was able to generate 31 distinct con gurations that, compared with
the status quo, have (i) a signi cantly smaller number of parties, (ii) higher discipline of partisans
towards their parties and (iii) more even distributions of partisans into parties. Besides comparing
with the status quo, ARRANGE will be compared with two random models: random-sq and random-
 . The competitors can be summarized as:
(1) status quo. It is the existing state of affairs, i.e., the actual and historical situation in Brazil
during the analyzed period.
(2) random-sq. It randomly redistributes the partisans among the existing parties. For each partisan
a   A, the model randomly pick an option [oa := (a, p, sim)]   Oa and assigns a to party
p. By using the options set Oa I guarantee that the party p allocated to a has voted for every
proposition voted by a, i.e., Ba   Bp.
(3) random- . Works in the same way as random-sq, but instead of allocating partisans to the actual
set of parties P, it randomly redistributes the partisans among the minimum set of parties P  
generated by Algorithm 2.
The random models are used to quantify the payoffs obtained by using ARRANGE when it gen-
erates the minimum party set P   (random-sq) and it ef ciently allocates partisans to the parties of
this set (random- ). Although not always visible, for all results of both models I also show the 99%
con dence interval.
In Fig. 6, I show the number of parties N   generated by ARRANGE for different values of  .
I also show the status quo, i.e., the actual number of parties N of which partisans were members
during the analyzed period, and the number of parties generated by random-sq. First, note that the
number of parties generated by ARRANGE is signi cantly lower than the status quo, decreasing
as   increases. Even when no partisans are allowed to decrease its discipline (  = 0), N   = 22,
a number   39% lower than 36, the status quo. Moreover, ARRANGE was able to generate a
con guration (c0.15) with only 13 parties (  64% reduction) and with all quality signals equal to 1
(Q1   Q2   Q3), i.e., with overall, party and partisan disciplines greater than the status quo. When
only Q2 and Q3 are 1 (Q2   Q3), ARRANGE could generate a con guration (c0.19) with N   = 10
parties, a   72% reduction. Finally, when only Q3 is 1 (Q3), ARRANGE could provide a   86%
reduction in the number of parties by generating a con guration (e.g. c0.41) with only 5 parties. It is
worth mentioning that the number of parties in Brazil is so excessive that even random-sq was able
to generate a con guration with fewer parties than the status quo.
Concerning discipline, I show in Fig. 7 the overall discipline (Fig. 7a) and the average party
(Fig. 7b) and partisan (Fig. 7c) disciplines of the con gurations produced by ARRANGE and its
competitors. Observe that for all discipline metrics the results produced by ARRANGE are very
similar with the status quo, even when all quality signals are 0. The discipline values decrease
signi cantly only for   values close to 1, when the number of parties generated by ARRANGE is 2
or 1. It is also interesting to note that the random models are able to produce con gurations with
considerably high levels of discipline, which shows that Brazilian political parties are, on average,
very similar to each other.
In order to analyze how well distributed are the partisans among parties, we compute the Gini
coef cient [53] for each con guration generated by ARRANGE and its competitors. The Gini co-
ef cient was initially proposed to describe the income inequality in a population [53]. It assumes
values from 0, which expresses perfect equality, where all parties have the same number of partisans,
to 1, which expresses maximal inequality among values, where all partisans are allocated to a single
party. Observe in Fig. 8 that ARRANGE is able to produce con gurations in which the partisans are
more evenly distributed than the status quo for all values of  . While the Gini coef cient is   0.64
for the status quo, it decreased to   0.43 for c0.15 (Q1   Q2   Q3), to   0.32 for con guration c0.41
(Q3), and to   0 for c0.5 (all quality signals equal to 0, but with discipline values similar with the
status quo). Model random-sq has a slightly high Gini coef cient than the status quo because a few

big parties are more likely to randomly receive new partisans, since they appear as an option in the
option sets Oa for all a   A.
Another relevant characteristic to be measured in political party systems is switching, i.e., party
changes among partisans. As stated by [43], switching effectively destroys the meaning of party
labels, raises voters  information costs, and eliminates party accountability, being a threat to the
very core of democratic representation. Thus, in Fig. 9, I plot the number of party changes among
partisans that would occur if the con gurations generated by ARRANGE and the random models
were the reality. Observe that in all scenarios generated by ARRANGE the number of changes is
lower than the status quo, random-sq and random- . This is another evidence of the importance of
reducing party fragmentation to have ideologically well de ned parties.
Now I will take a closer look at particular con gurations generated by ARRANGE, namely c0.15,
c0.19 and c0.41. These are the con gurations that have the lowest number of parties and achieved,
respectively, quality signals Q1   Q2   Q3, Q2   Q3 and only Q3. In Fig. 10a, I show the number
of active parties per year for the status quo and these three con gurations. First, observe that the
number of parties changes constantly over the years in Brazil, this being a harmful consequence of
its highly fragmented party system. On the other hand, observe that the con gurations generated by
ARRANGE are (i) much more stable over the years and (ii) have a signi cantly smaller number of
parties than the status quo.

Fig. 9. Total number of party changes among partisans.
Besides counting the actual number of parties per year, it is also important to measure the effective
number of parties. As described previously, it is a concept which provides for an adjusted number of
political parties in a country s party system, weighting the partisan count per party by their relative
strength [38]. In our case, the relative strength refers to their seat share in the parliament. This mea-
sure is especially useful to detect trends toward fewer or more numerous parties over time [38]. The
number of parties equals the effective number of parties only when all parties have equal strength.
In any other case, the effective number of parties is lower than the actual number of parties. It is
also a frequent metric for the fragmentation of a party system [9]. Moreover, although several in-
dexes for computing the effective number of parties exist [41], in this paper I use the Golosov index
1/si)   si) 1, where N is the actual number of parties, si is the proportional
share of each party pi, and s1 is the highest share of a party [41]. For the best of my knowledge,

Np is the most recent one and its results con rm it works better than earlier proposed alternatives in
measuring the effective number of components in highly fragmented and highly concentrated party
systems, which is the case of Brazil.
Thus, in Fig. 10b, we show the effective number of parties Np per year, calculated for con gura-
tions c0.15, c0.19 and c0.41 and for the status quo. First, observe that Np is signi cantly lower and
more stable for c0.15, c0.19 and c0.41 than for the status quo. While Np grows constantly after the
year 2000 for the status quo, it remains practically constant for the three con gurations generated
by ARRANGE. Moreover, if we consider only c0.41, Brazil would go from having one of the most
fragmented party systems in the world [8] to having one of the least fragmented [9], averaging 3.0
effective parties per year.
In Fig. 4b I showed the  rst two components of the PCA for the matrix MVBR composed by the
votes of the partisans of Brazil during the years of 1999 and 2000. In Fig. 11, I show this same result,
but I replace the status quo party labels by the ones generated by ARRANGE in c0.15, c0.19 and c0.41.
Observe that all three con gurations have a visually better clustering of partisans of the same party
than the status quo. This suggests that ARRANGE is also able to provide con gurations in which
parties are more different among themselves than in the status quo. I leave a deeper quantitative
analysis for future work.

8. DISCUSSION
In practical terms, the main contribution of ARRANGE to a government and its population is the
ability to provide a quantitative assessment of fragmentation in its party system. Given that the
A:18
effective number of parties is expected to re ect the number of issue (or ideological) dimensions
in a country [12], highly fragmented party systems overestimate this number of issue dimensions,
providing a distorted view to the population that harms democracy [47]. Thus, by mapping plenary
votes into ideological preferences, ARRANGE quantitatively provides an  ideal  number of parties
for a country given the ideological preferences of its congressmen, revealing the presumable true
number of issue dimensions that exists in this particular country. I used the expression  presum-
able true  because, as veri ed by [8], it is not always true that a disciplined and cohesive party
represents an ideological cleavage (or group) in society, i.e., its members may simply be a group of
congressmen obeying its leader in order to obtain a particular bene t.
It is also worth mentioning that ARRANGE also provides the list of parties that should ideally exist
and which partisans should be their members. Although I know a democratic government cannot
implement this solution easily, it can be used to support signi cant reforms in its political system.
With this in mind, I could not fail to mention in this paper that one of the possible reasons for Brazil s
high level of party fragmentation is the so called fundo partid ario, which are funds distributed by the
federal government to Brazilian political parties for them to spend indiscriminately. A share of the
amount paid by the federal government through the fundo partid ario is the same for every party, but
another part is proportional to the number of elected congressmen, senators and governors by each
organization. In 2014, PT, the party with the highest share (16.5%), received R$50, 314, 999.19
million reais from the fund. On the other hand, PROS, the party with the lowest share (0.16%),
received R$493,873.68 thousand reais in 2014 [54]. Consider that, in 2014, the exchange rate of the
real varied from U $2.19 to U $2.72 U.S. dollars. It is out of the scope of this paper to point fundo
partid ario as the main culprit for Brazil s high level of party fragmentation, but it poses as a clear
incentive for the creation of many parties in Brazil.
In spite of the fact that this work considers Brazil as its use case, the methods and results shown
here can be easily replicated to other countries that have highly fragmented party systems. Carsten
Anckar studied party system fragmentation in 77 countries [9] and reported high levels of fragmen-
tation for many countries besides Brazil, such as Bolivia, Bulgaria, Denmark, Ecuador, Finland,
France, Guatemala, India, Israel, Italy, Netherlands and Thailand. Nevertheless, it is important to
point out that this work was motivated and eased by the Open Data initiative of the Brazilian gov-
ernment, that provides public data related to politics and also to many other areas, such as demo-
graphics, government spending, budget and road accidents.
9. CONCLUSIONS
In this work, I proposed the method ARRANGE to assess and reduce fragmentation in multi-party
political systems. From roll votes data of partisans and their respective party leaders, ARRANGE
redistributes the partisans into new parties considering two con icting objectives: to minimize the
number of parties and to maximize party discipline. When applied to Brazilian historical roll call
data, ARRANGE was able to generate 23 distinct con gurations that, compared with the status quo,
have (i) a signi cantly smaller number of parties, (ii) higher discipline of partisans towards their
parties and (iii) more even distributions of partisans into parties. These results show that Brazil has
and had many redundant parties, i.e., parties that are very similar ideologically. Thus, if today Brazil
has one of the highest levels of party system fragmentation in the World [8; 9], this work proved
it could be much lower. Finally, it is important to point out that ARRANGE is a general method
and could be directly applied to analyze fragmentation in any of the many highly fragmented party
systems that exists in the world [9].
