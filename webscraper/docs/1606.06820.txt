Since the shooting of Black teenager Michael Brown by White police oﬃcer Darren Wilson in
Ferguson, Missouri, the protest hashtag #BlackLivesMatter has ampliﬁed critiques of extrajudicial
killings of Black Americans. In response to #BlackLivesMatter, other Twitter users have adopted
#AllLivesMatter, a counter-protest hashtag whose content argues that equal attention should be
given to all lives regardless of race. Through a multi-level analysis of over 860,000 tweets, we
study how these protests and counter-protests diverge by quantifying aspects of their discourse.
We ﬁnd that #AllLivesMatter facilitates opposition between #BlackLivesMatter and hashtags such
as #PoliceLivesMatter and #BlueLivesMatter in such a way that historically echoes the tension
between Black protesters and law enforcement.
In addition, we show that a signiﬁcant portion
of #AllLivesMatter use stems from hijacking by #BlackLivesMatter advocates. Beyond simply
injecting #AllLivesMatter with #BlackLivesMatter content, these hijackers use the hashtag to
directly confront the counter-protest notion of “All lives matter.” Our ﬁndings suggest that Black
Lives Matter movement was able to grow, exhibit diverse conversations, and avoid derailment on
social media by making discussion of counter-protest opinions a central topic of #AllLivesMatter,
rather than the movement itself.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Protest movements have a long history of forcing diﬃ-
cult conversations in order to enact social change, and the
increasing prominence of social media has allowed these
conversations to be shaped in new and complex ways.
Indeed, signiﬁcant attention has been given to how to
quantify the dynamics of such social movements. Recent
work studying social movements and how they evolve
with respect to their causes has focused on Occupy Wall
Street [1–3], the Arab Spring [4], and large-scale protests
in Egypt and Spain [5, 6]. The network structures of
movements have also been leveraged to answer questions
about how protest networks facilitate information diﬀu-
sion [7], align with geospatial networks [8], and impact
oﬄine activism [9–11]. Both oﬄine and online activists
have been shown to be crucial to the formation of protest
networks [12, 13] and play a critical role in the eventual
tipping point of social movements [14, 15].

The protest hashtag #BlackLivesMatter has come to
represent a major social movement. The hashtag was
started by three women, Alicia Garza, Patrisse Cullors,
and Opal Tometi, following the death of Trayvon Martin,
a Black teenager who was shot and killed by neighbor-
hood watchman George Zimmerman in February 2012
[16]. The hashtag was a “call to action” to address anti-
Black racism, but it was not until November 2014 when
White Ferguson police oﬃcer Darren Wilson was not in-
dicted for the shooting of Michael Brown that #Black-
LivesMatter saw widespread use. Since then, the hashtag
has been used in combination with other hashtags, such

∗ ryan.gallagher@uvm.edu

as #EricGarner, #FreddieGray, and #SandraBland, to
highlight the extrajudicial deaths of other Black Ameri-
cans. #BlackLivesMatter has organized the conversation
surrounding the broader Black Lives Matter movement
and activist organization of the same name. Some have
likened Black Lives Matter to the New Civil Rights move-
ment [17, 18], though the founders reject the comparison
and self-describe Black Lives Matter as a “human rights”
movement [19].

Researchers have only just begun to study the emer-
gence and structure of #BlackLivesMatter and its as-
sociated movement. To date and to the best of our
knowledge, Freelon et al. have provided the most com-
prehensive data-driven study of Black Lives Matter [20].
Their research characterizes the movement through mul-
tiple frames and analyzes how Black Lives Matter has
evolved as a movement both online and oﬄine. Other
researchers have given particular attention to the be-
ginnings of the movement and its relation to the events
of Ferguson, Missouri. Jackson and Welles have shown
that the initial uptake of #Ferguson, a hashtag that pre-
cluded widespread use of #BlackLivesMatter, was due to
the early eﬀorts of “citizen journalists” [21], and Bonilla
and Rosa argue that these citizens framed the story of
Michael Brown in such a way that facilitated its even-
tual spreading [22]. Other related work has attempted
to characterize the demographics of #BlackLivesMatter
users [23], how #BlackLivesMatter activists aﬀect sys-
temic political change [24], and how the movement self-
documents itself through Wikipedia [25].

#BlackLivesMatter has found itself contended by a
relatively vocal counter-protest hashtag: #AllLivesMat-
ter. Advocates of #AllLivesMatter aﬃrm that equal at-
tention should be given to all lives, while #BlackLives-

sample. The plot is annotated with several major events pertaining to the hashtags. Shaded regions indicate one-week periods
where use of both #BlackLivesMatter and #AllLivesMatter peaked in frequency. These are the periods we focus on in the
present study.

Matter supporters contend that such a sentiment derails
the Black Lives Matter movement. The counter-hashtag
#AllLivesMatter has received less attention in terms of
research, largely being studied from a theoretical angle.
The phrase “All Lives Matter” reﬂects a “race-neutral”
or “color-blind” approach to racial issues [26]. While
this sentiment may be “laudable,” it is argued that race-
neutral attitudes can mask power inequalities that result
from racial biases [27]. From this perspective, those who
adopt #AllLivesMatter evade the importance of race in
the discussion of Black deaths in police-involved shoot-
ings [28, 29]. To our knowledge, our work is the ﬁrst
to engage in a data-driven approach to understanding
#AllLivesMatter. This approach not only allows us to
substantiate several broad claims about the use of #Al-
lLivesMatter, but to also highlight trends in #AllLives-
Matter that are absent from the theoretical discussion of
the hashtag.

Given the popular framing of Black Lives Matter as
the New Civil Rights movement, the movement and its
oppositions are in and of themselves of interest to study.
Furthermore, while qualitative study of #AllLivesMat-
ter has provided a theoretical framing of the hashtag,
it is still unclear to what extent, if any, the All Lives
Matter movement hijacked the conversations of #Black-
LivesMatter. Through the computational analysis of over
860,000 tweets, in this paper we comprehensively quan-
tify the ways in which the protest and counter-protest
discourses of #BlackLivesMatter and #AllLivesMatter
diverge most signiﬁcantly. Unlike previous studies of po-
litical polarization that focus on hashtag trends or cu-
rated lists of terms [31, 32, 34, 35], the methods we lever-

age take advantage of the entirety of textual data, thus
giving weight to all protest sentiments that were voiced
through these hashtags.

Through application of these methods at the word
level and topic level, we ﬁrst show that #AllLivesMat-
ter diverges from #BlackLivesMatter through support
of pro-law-enforcement sentiments. This places #Black-
LivesMatter and hashtags such as #PoliceLivesMatter
and #BlueLivesMatter in opposition, a framing that is
in line with the theoretical understanding of #AllLives-
Matter and that mimics how relationships between black
protesters and law enforcement have been historically de-
picted. We then demonstrate that #AllLivesMatter ex-
periences signiﬁcant hijacking from #BlackLivesMatter,
while #BlackLivesMatter exhibits rich and information-
ally diverse conversations, of which hijacking is a much
smaller portion. These ﬁndings, which augment the the-
oretical discussion of the impact of the All Lives Matter
movement, suggest that the Black Lives Matter move-
ment was able to avoid being derailed by counter-protest
opinions on social media by relegating discussion of such
opinions to the counter-protest, rather than the move-
ment itself.

II. MATERIALS AND METHODS

A. Data Collection

We collected tweets containing #BlackLivesMatter
and #AllLivesMatter (case-insensitive) from the period

    Aug   2014      Sep      Oct      Nov      Dec        Jan      2015       Feb       Mar       Apr        May        Jun        Jul       AugTime (Days)05000100001500020000Number of TweetsDarren Wilsonnon-indictmentDaniel Pantaleonon-indictmentDeath of Two NYPD OfficersBaltimore ProtestsCharleston ChurchShootingWalter Scott DeathBeyonce, John LegendGrammy Performances andChapel Hill ShootingOutrage OverSandra Bland DeathNumber of #BlackLivesMatter and #AllLivesMatter Tweets (10% Gardenhose Sample)#BlackLivesMatter#AllLivesMatterAugust 8th, 2014 to August 31st, 2015 from the Twit-
ter Gardenhose feed. The Gardenhose represents a
10% random sample of all public tweets. Our sub-
sample resulted in 767,139 #BlackLivesMatter tweets
from 375,620 unique users and 101,498 #AllLivesMatter
tweets from 79,753 unique users. Of these tweets, 23,633
of them contained both hashtags. When performing our
analyses, these tweets appear in each corpus.

Previous work has emphasized the importance of view-
ing protest movements through small time scales [20, 21].
In addition, we do not attempt to characterize all of
the narratives that exist within #BlackLivesMatter and
#AllLivesMatter. Therefore, we choose to restrict our
analysis to eight one-week periods where there were si-
multaneous spikes in #BlackLivesMatter and #AllLives-
Matter. These one-week periods are labeled on Figure 1
and are as follows:

1. November 24th, 2014 : the non-indictment of Dar-

ren Wilson in the death of Michael Brown. [37]

2. December 3rd, 2014 : the non-indictment of Daniel

Pantaleo in the death of Eric Garner [38].

3. December 20th, 2014 : the deaths of New York City
police oﬃcers Wenjian Liu and Rafael Ramos [39].

4. February 8th, 2015 : the Chapel Hill shooting and
the 2015 Grammy performances by Beyonce and
John Legend [40, 41].

5. April 4th, 2015 : the death of Walter Scott [42].

6. April 26th, 2015 : the social media peak of protests

in Baltimore over the death of Freddie Gray [43].

7. June 17th, 2015 : the Charleston Church shooting

[44].

8. July 21st, 2015 : outrage over the death of Sandra

Bland [45].

B. Entropy and Diversity

A large part of our textual analysis relies on tools from
information theory, so we describe these methods here
and frame them in the context of the corpus. Given a
text with n unique words where the ith word appears
with probability pi, the Shannon entropy H encodes “un-
predictability” as

pi log2 pi.

(1)

i=1

Shannon’s entropy describes the unpredictability of a
body of text, and so, intuitively, we say that a text with
higher Shannon’s entropy is less predictable than a text
with lower Shannon’s entropy. It can then be useful to
think of Shannon’s entropy as a measure of diversity,

H = − n(cid:88)

3

where high entropy (unpredictability) implies high di-
versity.
In this case, we refer to Shannon’s entropy as
the Shannon index. We employ this raw diversity mea-
sure in Section III A to examine the diversity of language
surrounding individual words.

Of the diversity indices, only the Shannon index gives
In
equal weight to both common and rare words [46].
addition, even for a ﬁxed diversity index, care must be
taken in comparing diversity measures to one another
[46].
In order to make linear comparisons of diversity
between texts, we convert the Shannon index to an eﬀec-
tive diversity. The eﬀective diversity D of a text T with
respect to the Shannon index is given by

(cid:0)−(cid:80)n

(cid:1)

D = 2H = 2

i=1 pi log2 pi

.

(2)

The expression in Eq. 2 is also known as the perplexity of
the text. The eﬀective diversity allows us to accurately
make statements about the ratio of diversity between two
texts. For example, unlike the raw Shannon index, the
eﬀective diversity doubles in the situation of comparing
texts with n and 2n equally-likely words. We apply the
eﬀective diversity in Section III C.

C. Jensen-Shannon Divergence

The Kullback-Leibler divergence is a statistic that as-
sesses the distributional diﬀerences between two texts.
Given two texts P and Q with a total of n unique words,
the Kullback-Leibler divergence between P and Q is de-
ﬁned as

DKL(P||Q) =

pi log2

pi
qi

,

(3)

n(cid:88)

i=1

where pi and qi are the probabilities of seeing word i in
P and Q respectively. However, if there is a single word
that appears in one text but not the other, this divergence
will be inﬁnitely large. Because such a situation is not
unlikely in the context of Twitter, we instead leverage
the Jensen-Shannon divergence (JSD) [47], a smoothed
version of the Kullback-Leibler divergence:

DJS(P||Q) = π1DKL(P||M ) + π2DKL(Q||M ).

(4)

Here, M is the mixed distribution M = π1P +π2Q where
π1 and π2 are weights proportional to the sizes of P and
Q such that π1 + π2 = 1. The Jensen-Shannon diver-
gence has been previously used in textual analyses that
range from the study of language evolution [48, 49] to the
clustering of millions of documents [50].

The JSD has the useful property of being bounded be-
tween 0 and 1. The JSD is 0 when the texts have exactly
the same word distribution, and is 1 when neither text
has a single word in common. Furthermore, by the lin-
earity of the JSD we can extract the contribution of an
individual word to the overall divergence. The contribu-

tion of word i to the JSD is given by
DJS,i(P||Q) = −mi log2 mi + π1pi log2 pi + π2qi log2 qi,
(5)
where mi is the probability of seeing word i in M . The
contribution from word i is 0 if and only if pi = qi. There-
fore, if the contribution is nonzero, we can label the con-
tribution to the divergence from word i as coming from
text P or Q by determining which of pi or qi is larger.

III. RESULTS

A. Word-Level Divergence

For each of the eight time periods, the collections
of #BlackLivesMatter and #AllLivesMatter tweets are
each represented as bags of words where user handles,
links, punctuation, stop words, the retweet indicator
“RT,” and the two hashtags themselves are removed. We
then calculate the Jensen-Shannon divergence between
these two groups of text, and rank words by percent con-
tribution to the total divergence. We present the re-
sults of applying the JSD to the weeks following the non-
indictment of Darren Wilson and the Baltimore protests
in Figures 2–5 and the remaining periods in Appendix
Figures A1–A4.

All contributions on the JSD word shift graphs are
positive, where a bar to the left indicates the word was
more common in #AllLivesMatter and a bar to the right
indicates the word was more common in #BlackLives-
Matter. The bars of the JSD word shift graph are also
shaded according to the diversity of language surround-
ing each word. For each word w, we consider all tweets
containing w in the given hashtag. From these tweets,
we calculate the Shannon index of the underlying word
distribution with the word w and hashtag removed. A
high Shannon index indicates a high diversity of words
which, in the context of Twitter, implies that the word
w was used in a variety of diﬀerent tweets. On the other
hand, a low Shannon index indicates that the word w
originates from a few popular retweets. We emphasize
that here we are using the Shannon index not to com-
pare diversities between words, but to simply determine
if a word was used diversely or not. By using Figure A2
as a baseline (a period where #AllLivesMatter was domi-
nated by one retweet), we determine a rule of thumb that
a word is not used diversely if its Shannon index is less
than approximately 3 bits.

By inspection of Figure 2, we ﬁnd that #ferguson and
#fergusondecision, both hashtags relevant to the non-
indictment of Darren Wilson for the death of Michael
Brown, contribute to the divergence of #BlackLivesMat-
ter from #AllLivesMatter. Similarly, in Figure 5 #fred-
diegray emerges as a divergent hashtag during the Bal-
timore protests due to #BlackLivesMatter.
In each of
these periods, #BlackLivesMatter diverges from #All-
LivesMatter by talking proportionally more about the

word contributions are positive percentages of the total diver-
gence, where bars to the left and right indicate the word was
more common in #AllLivesMatter and #BlackLivesMatter
respectively. Shading indicate the Shannon index (in bits) of
tweets containing the given word. Lighter shading indicates
the contribution is due to one or several popular retweets.
Darker shading indicates the contribution is due to the word
being used throughout many diﬀerent tweets.

FIG. 3. Jensen-Shannon divergence word shift graph for
the week following the death of two NYPD police oﬃcers.
See main text and the caption of Fig. 2 for an explana-
tion of the word shift graphs. The diversity of “merica”
appears to be high, however it is almost exclusively used
in one popular retweet. This high diversity is due to al-
terations of the original retweet that added comments.
Since these less popular, modiﬁed retweets contain dif-
ferent language from one another, and the original tweet
has no other words used in it, the diversity surrounding
“merica” is artiﬁcially elevated. So, although uncommon,
the diversity measure may be diﬃcult to interpret in the
case of popular one-word retweets.

the week following the 2015 Grammy Awards and the

Fig. 2 for an explanation of the word shift graphs. This
period reﬂects a time in which usage of both #BlackLives-
Matter and #AllLivesMatter diverged due to focus on dif-
ferent events. Discussion within #AllLivesMatter reﬂects
the Chapel Hill shooting, while discussion within #Black-
LivesMatter reﬂects the 2015 Grammy Awards and the
performances of Beyonce and John Legend that alluded
to Black Lives Matter.

relevant deaths of Black Americans. Similar divergences
appear in the other periods as well, as evidenced by the
appearance of #ericgarner, #walterscott, and #sandrab-
land in the respective Appendix word shift graphs.

During important protest periods, the conversation
within #AllLivesMatter diversiﬁes itself around the lives
of law enforcement oﬃcers. As shown in Figure 5, dur-
ing the Baltimore protests in which #baltimoreuprising
and #baltimore were used signiﬁcantly in #BlackLives-
Matter, users of #AllLivesMatter responded with diverse
usage of #policelivesmatter and #bluelivesmatter. Sim-
ilarly, Figure 3 shows that upon the death of the two
NYPD oﬃcers, words such as “oﬃcers,” “ramos,” “liu,”
and “prayers” appeared in a variety of #AllLivesMatter
tweets. In addition, pro-law enforcement hashtags such
as #policelivesmatter, #nypd, #nypdlivesmatter, and
#bluelivesmatter all contribute to the divergence of #Al-
lLivesMatter from #BlackLivesMatter. Such divergence
comes at the same time that the hashtags #moa and
#blackxmas and words “protest,” “mall,” and “america”
were prevalent in #BlackLivesMatter due to Christmas
protests, speciﬁcally at the Mall of America in Blooming-
ton, Minnesota. So, in the midst of political protests by
Black Lives Matter advocates, we see a law-enforcement-
aligned response from #AllLivesMatter.

During the period following the non-indictment of Dar-
ren Wilson, there are some words, such as “oppression,”
“structural,” and “brutality,” that seem to suggest en-
gagement from #AllLivesMatter with the issues being
discussed within #BlackLivesMatter, such as structural
racism and police brutality. Since the diversities of these
words are low, we can inspect popular retweets contain-
ing these words to understand how they were used. Do-
ing so, we ﬁnd that the words actually emerge in #Al-
lLivesMatter due to hijacking [36], the adoption of a
hashtag to mock or criticize it. That is, these words
appear not because of discussion of structural oppres-
sion and police brutality by #AllLivesMatter advocates,
but because #BlackLivesMatter supporters are speciﬁ-
cally critiquing the fact such discussions are not occur-
ring within #AllLivesMatter.
(We have chosen to not
provide direct references to these tweets so as to protect
the identity of the original tweeter.) Similarly, a “3-panel
comic” strip criticizing the notion of “All Lives Matter”
circulated through #AllLivesMatter following the death
of Eric Garner (Figure A1), and after the Chapel Hill and
Charleston Church shootings, #BlackLivesMatter propo-
nents leveraged #AllLivesMatter to question why believ-
ers of the phrase were not more vocal (Figures 4 and A3).
We note that we are able to pick up on these instances of
hijacking by inspecting words with high divergence, but
low diversity (meaning the divergence comes almost en-
tirely from the few retweets containing the word). This
hijacking drives the divergence of #AllLivesMatter from
#BlackLivesMatter in many of these periods.

week encapsulating the peak of the Baltimore protests sur-
rounding the death of Freddie Gray. See main text and the
caption of Fig. 2 for an explanation of the word shift graphs.
In this period, the conservative alignment of #AllLivesMatter
is particularly prevalent, as seen in the hashtags #tcot (Top
Conservatives on Twitter), #ccot (Conservative Christians on
Twitter), and #rednationrising.

TABLE I. Summary statistics for topic networks created from
the full hashtag networks using the disparity ﬁlter at the sig-
niﬁcance level α = 0.03 [53].

B. Topic Networks

Having analyzed the micro-level dynamics of word us-
age within #BlackLivesMatter and #AllLivesMatter, we
turn to focus on the broader topics of these movements
and how these topics coincide with the word-level anal-
ysis. Previous work on political polarization has used
hashtags as a proxy for topics [30, 32, 34, 51, 52] and here
we use the same interpretation. However, not all hash-
tags assist in understanding the broad topics. For exam-
ple, #retweet and #lol are two such hashtags that fre-
quently appear in tweets, but they provide no evidently
relevant information about the events that are being dis-
cussed. Thus, we require a way of uncovering the most
important topics and how they connect to one another.
To ﬁnd these topics, we ﬁrst construct hashtag net-
works for each of #BlackLivesMatter and #AllLivesMat-
ter, where nodes are hashtags and weighted edges denote
co-occurrence of these hashtags. To extract the core
of this hashtag network, we apply the disparity ﬁlter,
a method introduced by Serrano et al. that yields the
“multiscale backbone” of a weighted network [53]. This
backbone extracts statistically signiﬁcant edges com-
pared to a null model where all weights are uniformly
distributed. We take the topic network to be the largest
connected component of the backbone. For signiﬁcance
level α < 0.03, the disparity ﬁlter begins to force drastic
drops in the number of nodes removed from the original
hashtag network, as shown in Figure B1. For this reason,
we analyze the backbones only for α ≥ 0.03.

Visualizations of the topic networks following the week
of the death of the two NYPD oﬃcers are presented in
Figures 6 and 7, and networks of the remaining periods
are shown in the Appendix. Node sizes are proportional
to the square root of the number of times each hashtag
was used, and node colors are determined by the Louvain
structure detection method [54]. The exact assignments
of topics to communities is not critical, but rather they
provide a visual guide through the networks.

Table I and Appendix Tables B1 and B2 report the
number of nodes, edges, clustering coeﬃcients, and per-
centages of nodes maintained from the full hashtag net-
works per each signiﬁcance level α = 0.03, 0.04, and 0.05
respectively. We see that across all time periods of in-
terest and signiﬁcance levels, the number of topics in
#BlackLivesMatter is higher than that of #AllLivesMat-
ter. We also note that the clustering of the #BlackLives-
Matter topics is less that of #AllLivesMatter almost al-
ways. Thus, not only are there more topics presented in
#BlackLivesMatter, but they are more diverse in their
connections. In contrast, the stronger #AllLivesMatter
ties, as measured by their clustering, suggest that the
#AllLivesMatter topics are more tightly connected and
revolve around similar themes. We see the clustering
is less within #AllLivesMatter during the week of Wal-
ter Scott’s death, where the topic network has a star-like
shape with no triadic closure across all signiﬁcance levels.
This low clustering is not indicative of diverse conversa-
tion, as the central node #BlackLivesMatter connects
several disparate topics. This is in line with our word-
level analysis, where we concluded from Figure A2 that
the discussion within #AllLivesMatter was dominated by
a retweet not pertaining to the death of Walter Scott, the
event of that time period.

In order to extract the most central topics of #Black-
LivesMatter and #AllLivesMatter during each time pe-
riod, we compare the results of three centrality measures,
betweenness centrality [55], random walk betweeness cen-
trality [56], and PageRank [57] on the topic networks
at signiﬁcance level α = 0.03. Through inspection of
the rankings of each list, we ﬁnd the relative rankings of
the most central topics in #BlackLivesMatter and #Al-
lLivesMatter are robust to the centrality measure used.
Table II shows the rankings according to random walk
centrality. Rankings from betweenness centrality and
PageRank are reported in Appendix Tables B3 and B4.
We see that for both #BlackLivesMatter and #All-
LivesMatter, the top identiﬁed topics are indicative of
the relative events occurring in each time period.
In
#BlackLivesMatter for instance, #ferguson and #mike-
brown are top topics after the non-indictment of Darren
Wilson, #walterscott is a top topic after the death of
Walter Scott, and #sandrabland and #sayhername are
a top topics during the time period following the death of
Sandra Bland. However, these major topics rank diﬀer-
ently in both #BlackLivesMatter and #AllLivesMatter.
For instance, while #mikebrown, #ericgarner, #icant-
breathe, #freddiegray, #baltimore, and #sandrabland
all consistently rank higher in #BlackLivesMatter than
in #AllLivesMatter. The signiﬁcant presence of these
hashtags within #BlackLivesMatter is consist with our
ﬁndings from the JSD word shift graphs.

The most prominent discussion of non-Black lives in
the topic networks of #AllLivesMatter is discussion of
police lives. We see that in #AllLivesMatter, #nypd,
#policelivesmatter, and #bluelivesmatter are ranked
higher as topics in #AllLivesMatter than in #Black-

TABLE II. The top 10 hashtags in the topic networks as determined by random walk betweeness centrality for each time period.
Some #AllLivesMatter topic networks have less than 10 top nodes due to the relatively small size of the networks.

10

FIG. 8. To control for how volume aﬀects the eﬀective diversity of #BlackLivesMatter and #AllLivesMatter, we break the
time scale down into months and subsample 2,000 tweets from each hashtag 1,000 times. The plot shows notched box plots
depicting the distributions of these subsamples for eﬀective lexical and hashtag diversity. The notches are small on all the
boxes, indicating that the mean diversities are signiﬁcantly diﬀerent at the 95% conﬁdence level across all time periods.

LivesMatter during December 20th and April 26th pe-
riods, similar to what we found in the JSD word shift
graphs. On the other hand, hashtags depicting strong
anti-police sentiment such as #killercops, #policestate,
and #fuckthepolice appear almost exclusively in #Black-
LivesMatter and are absent from #AllLivesMatter. The
alignment of #AllLivesMatter with police lives coincides
with a broader alignment with the conservative sphere
of Twitter that is apparent through the topic networks.
In several periods for #AllLivesMatter, #tcot is a cen-
tral topic, as well as #pjnet (Patriots Journal Network),
#wakeupamerica, and #defundplannedparenthood. The
hashtag #tcot also appears in several of the #BlackLives-
Matter periods as well. This is to be expected, as Freelon
et al. found that a portion of #BlackLivesMatter tweets
were hijacked by the conservative sphere of Twitter [20].

However, the hijacking of #BlackLivesMatter and con-
tent injection of conservative views is a much smaller
component of the #BlackLivesMatter topics as compared
to the respective hijacking of the #AllLivesMatter top-
ics. As evidenced both by the network statistics and
the network visualizations themselves, the #BlackLives-
Matter topic networks show that the conversations are
diverse and multifaceted while the #AllLivesMatter net-
works show conversations that are more limited in scope.
Furthermore, #BlackLivesMatter is consistently a more
central topic within the #AllLivesMatter networks than
#AllLivesMatter is within the #BlackLivesMatter net-
works. Thus, hijacking is more prevalent within #All-
LivesMatter, while #BlackLivesMatter users are able to
maintain diverse conversations and delegate hijacking to

only a portion of the discourse.

C. Conversational Diversity

Having quantiﬁed both the word-level divergences and
the large-scale topic networks, we now measure the in-
formational diversity of #BlackLivesMatter and #All-
LivesMatter more precisely. We do this through two
approaches. First, we measure “lexical diversity,” the
diversity of words other than hashtags. Second, we mea-
sure the hashtag diversity. We measure these diversities
using the eﬀective diversity described in Eqn. 2 in Sec-
tion II B. Furthermore, to account for the diﬀerent vol-
ume of #BlackLivesMatter and #AllLivesMatter tweets,
we break the time scale down into months and subsample
2,000 tweets from each hashtag 1,000 times, calculating
the eﬀective diversities each time. The results are shown
in Figure 8.

The lexical diversity of #BlackLivesMatter is larger
than #AllLivesMatter in eight of the ten months with
an average lexical diversity that is 5% more than that
of #AllLivesMatter. Interestingly, the two cases where
#AllLivesMatter has higher lexical diversity are in the
two periods when there were large non-police-involved
shootings of people of color and #AllLivesMatter was
used as a hashtag of solidarity. However, the more strik-
ing diﬀerences are in terms of hashtag diversity. On av-
erage, the hashtag diversity of #BlackLivesMatter is six
times that of #AllLivesMatter. This is in line with our
network analysis where we found expansive #BlackLives-

80010001200140016001800Effective Lexical DiversityEffective Lexical Diversity Subsamples#BlackLivesMatter#AllLivesMatter            Nov           2014            Dec             Jan            2015             Feb            Mar            Apr            May             Jun              Jul            AugMonth050100150200250300350400450Effective Hashtag DiversityEffective Hashtag Diversity SubsamplesMatter topic networks and tightly clustered, less diverse
#AllLivesMatter topic networks.

The low hashtag diversity of #AllLivesMatter is rela-
tively constant. One could imagine that the lack of di-
versity in the topics of #AllLivesMatter is a result of a
focused conversation that does not deviate from its main
message. However, as we have demonstrated through the
JSD word shift graphs and topic networks, the conver-
sation of #AllLivesMatter does change and evolve with
respect to the diﬀerent time periods. We see mentions
of the major deaths and events of these periods within
#AllLivesMatter, even if they do not rank as highly in
terms of topic centrality. So, even though both protest
hashtags have overlap on many of the major topics, the
diversity of topics found within #BlackLivesMatter far
exceeds that of #AllLivesMatter, even when accounting
for volume.

IV. DISCUSSION.

Through a multi-level analysis of #BlackLivesMatter
and #AllLivesMatter tweets, ranging from the word level
to the topic level, we have demonstrated key diﬀerences
between the two protest groups. Although one of these
diﬀerences has been proportionally higher discussion of
Black deaths in #BlackLivesMatter, it is important to
note that #AllLivesMatter is not completely devoid of
discussion about these deaths. For instance, #riper-
icgarner is prominent within #AllLivesMatter follow-
ing the death of Eric Garner, #iamame (“I am African
Methodist Episcopal”) contributes more to #AllLives-
Matter following the Charleston Church shooting, and
the names of several Black Americans appear in the #Al-
lLivesMatter topic networks. However, many of these
signs of solidarity are associated with low diversity. In
light of this, it is also important to note that there is
a lack of discussion of other deaths within #AllLives-
Matter. That is, in examining several of the main peri-
ods where #AllLivesMatter spikes, only the Chapel Hill
shooting period (Figures 4 and B7) shows discussion of
non-Black deaths.

The word shift graphs and topic networks reveal that
the only other lives that are signiﬁcantly discussed within
#AllLivesMatter are the lives of law enforcement oﬃcers,
particularly during times in which there is heavy protest-
ing. Although the notions of “Black Lives Matter” and
“Police Lives Matter” are not necessarily mutually exclu-
sive [29], we see that the conversations within #AllLives-
Matter often frame Black protesters versus law enforce-
ment with an“us versus them” mentality. This framing
echoes the ways in which media outlets have historically
framed the tension between Black protesters and law en-
forcement [58–60], where police oﬃcers and protesters are
seen as “enemy combatants” [28] and such movements

11

appear to “jeopardize law enforcement lives” [29]. So,
by facilitating this opposition, #AllLivesMatter becomes
the center of upholding historically contentious views in
the midst of what some consider the New Civil Rights
Movement.

In line with Freelon et al.’s ﬁndings, we have uncovered
hijacking of #BlackLivesMatter by #AllLivesMatter ad-
vocates [20]. Such hijacking is similar to the content
injection described by Conover et al.
[30], where one
group adopts the hashtag of politically opposed group in
order to inject their ideological beliefs. Such content in-
jection has also between found in the work of Egyptian
political polarization [34]. However, a signiﬁcant por-
tion #AllLivesMatter hijacking by #BlackLivesMatter
supporters is not simple content injection. Rather, advo-
cates of #BlackLivesMatter often use #AllLivesMatter
to directly interrogate the stance of “All Lives Matter”
and the worldview implied by that phrase. Furthermore,
such discussions have largely been relegated to #All-
LivesMatter, allowing #BlackLivesMatter to exhibit di-
verse conversations about a variety of topics. Although
past research has expressed concern that #AllLivesMat-
ter would derail from the movement started by #Black-
LivesMatter [26, 28, 29, 61], our data-driven approach
has allowed us to uncover that #BlackLivesMatter has
countered #AllLivesMatter content injection.

We were largely able to unpack these narratives by
looking not just as hashtag trends and curated term lists,
as in previous studies, but at the entirety of the text and
how it is structured at both the word and topic levels. In
this sense, our work falls closer to that of researchers who
have constructed networks of these protest movements to
inform largely qualitative research [5, 21, 36], rather than
research that focuses solely on the topological properties
of the networks. Our methods generalize to studying
how the discourse of two or more protest movements di-
verge from one another and how these diﬀerences can be
captured at the word and topic levels. Furthermore, by
integrating diversities within our divergence analysis, we
have shown how we can measure word-level diﬀerences
between protests and counter-protests in such a way that
facilitates follow-up qualitative investigation of how ex-
actly those words contribute to the divergence. Overall,
these tools provide an avenue for exploring more of the
data narratives between #BlackLivesMatter and #All-
LivesMatter, and other instances of political polarization.

FIG. A1. Jensen-Shannon divergence word shift graph for
the week following the non-indictment of Daniel Pantaleo.
See main text and the caption of Fig. 2 for an explanation
of the word shift graphs. The leading contributors to
the divergence on the side of #AllLivesMatter are due to
a popular retweet discussing a “3-panel” sketch “comic”
that describes what the “problem” with #AllLivesMatter
is.

FIG. A2. Jensen-Shannon divergence word shift graph
for the week following the death of Walter Scott. See
main text and the caption of Fig. 2 for an explanation
of the word shift graphs. The leading contributors to
the divergence on the side of #AllLivesMatter are due to
a popular retweet that asks why people are not paying
attention to a school massacre that occurred in Kenya.
This retweet is persistent, which is why the words “kenya”
and “massacre” appear in later dates, such as in Fig. 5

FIG. B1. Percent of original hashtag network maintained for #BlackLivesMatter (top) and #AllLivesMatter (bottom) at each
of the periods of interest for varying levels of the disparity ﬁlter signiﬁcance level. We wish to ﬁlter as much of the network as
possible, while avoiding sudden reductions in the number of nodes in the network. Note, when going from α = 0.03 to α = 0.02,
the February 8th #BlackLivesMatter and July 21st #AllLivesMatter networks fall in size by a factor of approximately one
half. Therefore, we choose α = 0.03.

TABLE B3. The top 10 hashtags in the topic networks as determined by betweenness centrality for each time period. Some
#AllLivesMatter topic networks have less than 10 top nodes due to the relatively small size of the networks. For example, in
the period of April 4th, the #AllLivesMatter network consists of #blacklivesmatter as a hub with six edges connecting it to
six other hashtags. Thus, #blacklivesmatter is the only node visited when calculating paths for betweenness.
