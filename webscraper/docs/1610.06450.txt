ABSTRACT 

Accessibility  is  essentially  a  dynamic  concept.  However,  most  studies  on  urban  accessibility 
take  a  static  approach,  overlooking  the  fact  that  accessibility  conditions  change  dramatically 
throughout the day. Due to their high spatial and temporal resolution, the new data sources 
(Big  Data)  offer  new  possibilities  for  the  study  of  accessibility.  The  aim  of  this  paper  is  to 
analyse urban accessibility considering its two components –the performance of the transport 
network and the attractiveness of the destinations– using a dynamic approach using data from 
TomTom  and  Twitter  respectively.  This  allows  us  to  obtain  profiles  that  highlight  the  daily 
variations in accessibility in the city of Madrid, and identify the influence of congestion and the 
changes in location of the population. These profiles reveal significant variations according to 
transport zones. Each transport zone has its own accessibility profile, and thus its own specific 
problems, which require solutions that are also specific.

1 INTRODUCTION  

Accessibility is a key concept in urban and regional planning for its capacity to link the activities 
of  people  and  businesses  to  the  possibilities  of  reaching  them  effectively.  Accessibility 
therefore  simplifies  the  relationship  between  land  use  and  transport,  and  models  the 
interaction between both systems. Interest in the relationship between transport systems and 
spatial  interaction  has  grown  exponentially,  and  for  more  than  five  decades  accessibility 
analysis has played a key role in the agenda of regional and transport research (Reggiani and 
Martín 2011). 

Accessibility  is  a  dynamic  attribute  of  locations  that  varies  over  time  due  to  changes  in  the 
transport  network  and  in  the  attractiveness  of  destinations  for  certain  activities.  One  of  the 
challenges  when  studying  accessibility  is  to  improve  the  method  of  introducing  the  spatial-
temporal dimension, and particularly the analysis of daily changes (Geurs and van Wee 2004; 
Geurs et al. 2015; van Wee 2016), an issue that has scarcely been addressed until now due to 
the  limitations  of  traditional  data  sources.  Some  works  have  used  these  data  sources  to 
analyse  the  effect  of  congestion  on  accessibility,  considering  solely  extreme  situations  (peak 
and valley times) based on the network (for example, Vandenbulcke et al. 2009; Yiannakoulias 
et al. 2013), but not the temporal changes in the performance of the infrastructures that occur 
throughout the day.  

Today’s  new  big  data  sources  offer  exciting  opportunities  for  the  dynamic  analysis  of 
accessibility. The information on transport networks has improved conclusively in recent years 
thanks  to  the  emergence  of  big  data  generated  by  social  media,  smartphones,  Satnav  and 
other technologies (van Wee 2016). Navigation companies such as TomTom, NavTeq, Inrix and 
more; websites like Here, Bing Maps, Google Maps-Google Transit; collaborative projects like 
Open-Street-Map;  and  the  public  availability  of  Transit  Feed  Specification  (GTFS)  data  from 
transit  authorities,  among  others,  open  up  a  growing  field  of  research  on  time-of-day 
variations in private and public  transit accessibility (Geurs  et al.  2016).  These companies and 
institutions  have  increasingly  detailed  systems  with  plentiful  information  on  the  features  of 
roads  and  public  transport  networks,  and  their  databases  include  information  on  speed 
variations  on  the  roads  and  the  frequencies  of  passage  in  public  transport  networks,  all  of 
which contribute a more efficient and dynamic vision to intraurban accessibility studies.  

There is very little research using the new sources in studies on travel times and accessibility. A 
first group of papers employ data obtained from GPS devices. Møller-Jensen et al. (2012) used 
GPS  logs  to  calculate  speeds,  congestion  levels  and accessibility  conditions  at  three  times  of 
day (morning, midday, evening,) in the city of Accra. Dewulf et al. (2015) took Floating Car Data 
(FCD)  from  the  Be-Mobile  system  to  calculate  car  travel  times.  Be-Mobile  provides  the 
geolocated  positions  of  400,000  vehicles  equipped  with  track  and  trace  devices.  The  travel 
time measures are further aggregated to produce a generic travel time for peak and off-peak 
periods.  Elsewhere,  Owen  and  Levinson  (2015)  calculated  car  accessibility  dynamically  from 
data recorded by loop detectors and GPS data.  

Other  works  have  studied  information  from  web  services  to  calculate  travel  times  between 
origins  and  destinations.  Martin  et  al.  (2002;  2008)  incorporated  public  transport  timetable 
data  from  a  web  service  to  analyse  accessibility  to  hospitals  in  England.  Páez  et  al.  (2013) 
developed a web-based accessibility instrument using Google Maps API to retrieve information 
about  local  amenities  (e.g.  groceries,  restaurants,  fitness  centres,  banks  and  others)  and 
estimate  accessibility  by  car,  walking  and  cycling.  Farber  et  al.  (2014)  used  General  Transit 
Feed  Specification  (GTFS)  data  to  calculate  dynamic  accessibility  to  food  stores  by  transit.

Boisjoly  and  El-Geneidy  (2016)  calculated  transit  accessibility  to  jobs,  accounting  for 
fluctuations in job availability (mobility survey data) and transit service (GTFS data) throughout 
the  day.  Jäppinen  et  al.  (2013)  used  transport  information  interfaces  for  Greater  Helsinki  to 
analyse  improvements  in  public  transport  times  after  a  complementary  bike  sharing  system 
was added to the network.  

Of particular interest for this work are the dynamic data from companies that offer daily Speed 
Profiles with a high spatial and temporal resolution. These companies use crowd-sourcing, Big 
Data  analytics  and  location  technologies  to  obtain  real-time  traffic  and  speed  data  that 
leverage current, historical and predictive traffic information across the roadway network. The 
best-known of these companies is Google, although Inrix and TomTom also provide this type of 
data.  The  works  published  using  this  type  of  data  sources  include  particularly  those  from 
Toronto  by  Sweet  et  al.  (2014,  2015),  who  studied  the  impact  of  congestion  on  accessibility 
and  its  consequences  on  company  localisation  using  historic  speed  data  for  motorways  and 
major  arterial  networks  provided  by  Inrix.  Elsewhere,  Moya-Gómez  and  García-Palomares 
(2015)  applied  data  supplied  by  the  TomTom  navigation  company  –specifically  the  “Speed 
Profiles”  product–  to  create  dynamic  maps  that  reveal  the  impact  of  congestion  on  daily 
accessibility  in  the  metropolitan  area  of  Madrid.  “Speed  Profiles”  shows  the  speed  on  each 
section  of  the  road  network  every  five  minutes.  These  are  historical  data  obtained  from 
different  devices,  including  the  company's  own  navigators  and  mobile  phone  GPS.  This  new 
source has so far been underexploited in the study of accessibility.  

In addition to network performance, the study of daily accessibility also needs to incorporate 
the  effect  of  variations  in  the  attractiveness  of  destinations  for  certain  desired  activities.  In 
static  accessibility  analyses,  destination  attractiveness  is  measured  through  variables  such  as 
population  or  employment.  However,  dynamic  analyses  take 
into  account  that  the 
destinations’  attractiveness  changes  throughout  the  day.  The  population  distribution  in  the 
city  varies  at  different  times  of  day  depending  on  the  type  of  activities  that  predominate  in 
each  time  band  (for  example,  work  in  the  morning,  shopping  and  leisure  in  mid-afternoon), 
and can be analysed from the population's digital footprint every hour of the day and at each 
point  in  the  city.  A  dynamic  focus  must  therefore  be  included  in  the  accessibility  analysis, 
based  on  activities  (where  the  population  is  at  each  time  of  the  day)  as  a  proxy  for  the 
destinations’  attractiveness.  Traditional  data  sources  (censuses)  offer  information  on  the 
spatial  distribution  of  the  population  at  night  (place  of  residence)  but  not  on  their  location 
throughout  the  day, whereas  the  new  data  sources allow  a dynamic approach to  population 
distribution  in  the  city.  Mobile  phone  logs  –so-called  CDR  (Call  Detail  Records)–  have  been 
used to map the density of mobile phone activity at different times of the day as an indicator 
of spatial-temporal changes in the population density in the city (Ratti et al. 2006; Reades et al. 
2009).  As  the  density  of  calls  varies  in  different  time  bands  and  reflects  the  changes  in 
population densities, each area of the city has its own signature; that is to say, a time profile of 
mobile phone use, which is very frequent in areas of activity in the central hours of the day, 
whereas in residential areas it is higher in the afternoon and early evening (Reades et al. 2009; 
Louail et al. 2014; Grauwin et al. 2015).  

Social  networks  also  reflect  the  rhythms  of  the  city.  The  most  widely  used  data  from  social 
networks in urban studies come from Twitter (see Murthy 2013), due to its considerable reach 
and  the  fact  that  the  tweets  can  be  downloaded  free  from  the  Internet.  The  densities  of 
tweets sent from each area of the city reveal the population densities (Jiang et al. 2016). Maps 
of  tweet  density  can  be  obtained  according  to  the  age,  gender  and  ethnic  group  of  the 
tweeter, if this information can be inferred from the user identifier (Longley et al. 2015). One 

 

4 

approach to the analysis of the daily changes in the population distribution in the city is to map 
the spatial distribution of the tweets according to the time of day (Ciuccarelli  et al. 2014). In 
addition  to  the  official  statistics  that  show  the  population’s  place  of  residence,  the  spatial-
temporal analysis of tweets is now making it possible to move beyond night-time geographies 
of residence to see how they compare with daytime activity patterns (Longley et al. 2015).  

The  spatial-temporal  analysis  of  tweets  allows  researchers  to  track  users  and  deduce  their 
mobility patterns (Wu et al. 2014), and reveals the spaces where different population groups 
converge, either based on income bands (Netto et al. 2015) or race (Shelton et al. 2015). The 
reliability of Twitter data in mobility studies has been validated in the work of Lenormand et al. 
(2014),  who  compared  the  data  from Twitter,  mobile  telephony  and official  data  (censuses), 
and  concluded  that  the  three  information  sources  offer  comparable  results.  However,  no 
research has been found in which these new data sources (mobile telephony, social networks 
and others) have been used as a proxy for the variability in destinations’ attractiveness in the 
study of dynamic accessibility. 

The literature review uncovers very few works that have applied these new data sources to the 
study of accessibility, and very few that have calculated accessibility in a dynamic way. Those 
that do, look at the temporal variation in only one component of accessibility, namely network 
performance. The aim of this paper is to analyse the variations in daily accessibility integrating 
the  time  variability  of  access  times  and  the  attractiveness  of  the  destinations.  We  used  the 
TomTom  “Speed  Profiles”  product  to  study  the  variation  in  travel  times  (the  effect  of 
congestion), which includes the speeds on each roadway section every five minutes. The daily 
variation  in  the  destinations’  attractiveness  was  studied  using  geolocated  Twitter  data.  Each 
message contains the time and the geographic coordinates of the place from which the tweet 
is  sent,  along  with  the  user  identifier.  This  enables  a  map  to  be  created  showing  the 
distribution of Twitter  users  for  each  transport  zone  in  the  study  area  every  15 minutes,  for 
use as a proxy for the attractiveness of each zone at each time of day. These data sources are 
used to make a dynamic study of accessibility, and analyse the influence of each accessibility 
component (network performance and the attractiveness of the destinations for activities) in 
each transport zone and at each time of day. The study area is the city of Madrid.  

The paper contributes to the literature in several ways.  To the best of our knowledge, this is 
the first time an accessibility analysis has been undertaken using new data sources with global 
coverage (TomTom and Twitter) considering the two components of accessibility dynamically, 
namely travel time and destination attractiveness. Accessibility is calculated every 15 minutes, 
which  provides  a  sequence  of  high-resolution  time  maps,  instead  of  several  “fixed  photos”, 
which  are  then  animated  in  the  form  of videos,  and  the  time  profile  (the  signature)  of each 
transport zone. Finally, assessment scenarios are built to give an insight into the influence of 
both accessibility components as they change throughout the course of the day.   

The  article  is  structured  as  follows.  After  this  introduction,  section  2  describes  the  data  and 
their  pre-processing  to  obtain  the  dynamic  variables  necessary  for  the  calculation  of  the 
accessibility  indicator.  Section  3  presents  the  accessibility  indicator  and  the  assessment 
scenarios  used  to  analyse  dynamic  accessibility  and  differentiate  the  effects  of  network 
congestion and destination attractiveness. Section 4 contains the results of this research, and 
finally section 5 presents the main conclusions.

2 STUDY CONTEXT 

Madrid was chosen as the study area for testing the proposed methodology. The metropolitan 
area of Madrid has a total of 6 million inhabitants and 2.5 million jobs, but the distribution of 
the population and employment inside the city is very uneven. The city centre is home to 55% 
of  the  population,  but  65%  of  the  city’s  jobs.  Other  differences  include  a  marked  contrast 
between the north of the city –where a substantial proportion of the economic activities have 
been displaced– and the south, with a distinctly residential nature. As a result of this uneven 
distribution  of  population  and  employment,  there  is  a  predominance  of  flows  from  the 
suburbs to the centre and from the south to the north in the early hours of the morning, and 
from  the  centre  to  the  suburbs  and  from  north  to  south  in  the  evening,  which  has  direct 
consequences  on  road  congestion  and  accessibility.  The  inbound  radial  motorways  and  the 
orbital  motorways  in  the  north-south  direction  are  congested  at  the  morning  peak  time, 
whereas the opposite occurs at the afternoon peak time.  

 

3 DATA DESCRIPTION AND DATA PRE-PROCESSING  

Two datasets are involved in the accessibility measures presented in this paper: the dataset for 
the  distribution  of  the  attraction  factor,  and  the  road  network  dataset  that  allows  the 
computation  of  OD  travel  times.  As  our  aim  is  to  analyse  dynamic  accessibility  (across  the 
metropolitan area of Madrid), both datasets must have fine spatial and temporal resolutions. 

3.1 TomTom Speed Profiles and minimum travel time calculations 

This  study  uses  the  March  2013  version  of  TomTom®  for  the  road  network,  which  contains 
data  on  historical  Speed  Profiles  for  the  years  2011  and  2012  obtained  from  the  average 
journey times reported from users’ navigation devices. As the original network is very detailed 
(it  includes  accesses  to  car  parks,  pedestrian  streets,  residential  streets  and  country  roads), 
arcs  where  not  much  traffic  is  expected  have  been  omitted.  The  arcs  used  in  the  study  are 
defined  by TomTom®  as  ranging  from  0  to 6  in the Functional  Road  Classification  (FRC).  The 
network covers the whole metropolitan area of Madrid and has full connectivity, with  a total 
of 12,935 km (18,235 km one-way arcs), of which 81% have historic Speed Profiles.  

Historic Speed Profiles are defined every 5 minutes as a percentage of the free-flow speed of 
the arc. As a result,  the  arc  of a motorway and a city street may  both  have  the  same  speed 
profile  but  different  speeds  at  the  same  instant  because  of  their  different  free-flow  speeds. 
This data structure saves on computational memory and cost and is prepared for use with the 
GIS software ESRI® ArcGIS. An aggregation of these speed variations every 15 minutes is shown 
in video 1.  

We calculated the travel time per OD pair of transport zones  every 15 minutes. This includes 
the  speed  variations  throughout  the  journey.  Our  results  were  first  grouped  by  start  times, 
which  is  the  only  output  option  of  the  OD  Cost  Matrix  ArcGIS  tool.  However,  we  wanted  to 
group  them  by  end  time,  i.e.  how  long  an  individual  must  travel  in  order  to  reach  their 
destination zone at a certain time. We interpolated these values from the original matrices by 
splines using the SciPy Python library, as we knew the arrival time and travel time for each OD 
pair.

3.2 Geolocated tweets and attractiveness of destinations   

We chose to use Twitter data as a proxy to estimate the attraction factor of different transport 
zones  in the study area. Table 1 shows the main figures  in  the dataset of geolocated  tweets 
published between January 2012 and December 2013 in our study area, which is the basis of 
our research.

The number of active users in each transport zone at each time of day was calculated using a 
Geographic Information System (ArcGIS 10.3).  The data was  treated  to convert single tweets 
into  an  attraction  factor  that  varies  spatially  and  temporally  by  first  selecting  the  tweets 
corresponding  to  typical  working  days  (i.e.  Tuesday  to  Thursday)1,  and  second,  computing  a 
joint spatial (transport zones2) and temporal (15-minute period) aggregation in order to obtain 
the number of single users in each zone at each time of the day (see video 2).  

Figure  1  shows  the  wide  variation  in  active  Twitter  users  throughout  the  day,  with  a  clear 
minimum  in  the  central  hours  of  the  night  and  a  maximum  between  8  pm  and  10  pm.  The 
night  hours  when  the  population  is  not  engaged  in  any  activity  are  of  no  interest  from  the 
point  of  view  of  accessibility  analysis.  The  period  between  midnight  and  7  am  was  thus 
discarded, which  in Madrid  tends to  correspond to  the  period of  night-time  rest.  Between 7 
am and midnight there is an uneven distribution of active  tweeters, although the  size of the 
population remains the same (approximately); the individuals simply move from some places 
to  others  within  the metropolitan  area.  We  therefore  opted  to  normalise the data on  active 
tweeters in  units  per 100,000 to  obtain a proxy for the spatial distribution of the population 
according  to  the  place  they  are  tweeting  from  throughout  the  day,  in  order  to  estimate  the 
attractiveness of each transport zone  in the  accessibility analysis. The greater the  size  of the 
population in a transport zone, the greater its attractiveness at that time of day.

represent  the  average  working  day,  while  Monday  and  Friday  have  specific  profiles  influenced  by  the 
proximity of Sunday and Saturday respectively. 
2 Transport zones correspond to homogeneous land-use areas. There are 1,171 transport zones in the 
study area.

4 METHODS  

4.1 Accessibility calculations 

The  dynamic  approach  proposed  in  this  paper  involves  calculating  the  accessibility  of  each 
transport  zone  every  15  minutes  based  on  the  spatial  distribution  of  the  population 
(normalised number of tweeters) in that quarter hour, and the travel times between each OD 
pair according to the arrival time at the destination transport zone. This is done by using the 
potential accessibility indicator, which shows the spatial interaction between a specific origin 
and  all  the  destinations  taking  into  consideration  the  degree  of  attractiveness  of  each 
destination, the  cost of travel and the distance  decay,  i.e., how  fast  the  interaction drops  as 
the transport cost increases (Reggiani et al., 2011). Since it is generally agreed that exponential 
functions  are  more  appropriate  for  analysing  short  distance  interactions  such  as  those 
occurring  within  urban  areas  (Bruno  and  Genovese,  2012),  we  computed  the  potential 
accessibility using an exponential function according to the following formula: 

𝑃𝑖𝑡 = ∑ 𝑀𝑗𝑡 · 𝑒𝛼·𝐶𝑖𝑗𝑡

𝑛
𝑗=1

∗ 

   

 

 

 

 

 (1) 

Where  Pit  is  the  potential  accessibility  of  transport  zone  i  at  time  t,  Mjt  is  the  normalized 
∗   is the travel time through the road network 
number of tweets in transport zone j at time t, 𝐶𝑖𝑗𝑡
between transport zones i and j at time t, and α is a parameter indicating the distance decay. 
In this case,  we  calibrated α using the Hyman algorithm (Ortúzar and Willumsen, 2011,  192) 
with the 2004 Region of Madrid Mobility Survey. The resulting parameter was -0.12957849. 

To  determine  the  self-potential,  the  internal  transport  zone  times  were  calculated  as  the 
average minimum travel time between 10% of the randomly chosen network junctions to their 
centroid zone.  

∗   
Finally, we  added  half  the travel time of  the origin/destination zone  to each journey.  So 𝐶𝑖𝑗𝑡
was calculated according to:

(2) 

To  isolate  the  effect  of  each  accessibility  component  (ease  of  access  via  the  network  and 
destination  attractiveness)  on  dynamic  accessibility,  this  indicator  was  calculated  for  each 
scenario described in subsection 4.2. Given that the approach taken in this research requires 
numerous  accessibility  calculations  (depending  on  the  scenarios  and  times  of  day),  this 
indicator was integrated in a single ArcGIS toolbox in order to facilitate its computation. 

4.2 Scenarios 

Four scenarios were considered for the analysis of dynamic accessibility and the influence of its 
different components (travel time and destination attractiveness): 

a)  Reference scenario.- Accessibility is calculated based on average travel times and the 
average  spatial  distribution  of  the  tweeters  throughout  the  day.  This  is  therefore  a 
static scenario that is taken as a reference to assess the changes that occur throughout 
the day based on the temporal variations in congestion and the spatial distribution of 
the population within the metropolitan area.  

b)  Dynamic accessibility scenario.- Accessibility is calculated every 15 minutes taking into 

account the variability in congestion and the spatial distribution of the tweeters.  

c)  Dynamic congestion scenario.- Accessibility is calculated every 15 minutes considering 
the  variation  in  congestion  levels,  while  the  population  distribution  remains  static 
(average  spatial  distribution  of  the  tweeters  throughout  the  day).  This  makes  it 
possible to isolate the effect of the variation in congestion levels on accessibility. 

d)  Dynamic  attractiveness  scenario.-  Accessibility  is  calculated  every  15  minutes,  but  in 
this  case  only  the  variation  in  the  population  distribution  is  considered  dynamic, 
whereas congestion remains static (average travel times). 

The  dynamic  accessibility  analysis  is  compared  with  the  reference  scenario  to  identify  the 
differences  (according  to  the  times of  day)  produced  by  the  dynamic  approach  compared to 
the  static  approach.  The  dynamic  congestion  and  attractiveness  scenarios  highlight  the 
influence of each of these two components on dynamic accessibility.  

 

5 RESULTS 

Figure  2  shows  the  temporal  pattern  of  average  accessibility  values  for  the  whole  of  the 
metropolitan area of Madrid according to  journey arrival  times and  scenarios. The reference 
scenario  has  an  average  value  of  around  6,200  potential  units  and  represents  the  average 
accessibility  throughout  the  day.  The  curve  for  the  dynamic  accessibility  scenario  is 
substantially higher than this average value in the early hours of the morning (between 7 and 
7:30 am) and from 6:30 pm, revealing a higher than average accessibility in this time band. In 
contrast, it is clearly below the average for the static scenario between 7:30 am and 6:30 pm, 
and particularly around 8:30 and 9:30 am and between 3 and 6 pm.  

The pattern of dynamic accessibility depends on the joint action of the changes in congestion 
and  population  distribution  throughout  the  day.  The  curves  for  the  dynamic  congestion  and 
attractiveness  scenarios  generally  show  opposing  behaviours.  If  the  population  distribution 

 

9 

remains  fixed (dynamic  congestion  scenario), two  clear  times  with  lower accessibility  can  be 
observed, corresponding to the morning and afternoon peaks (high levels of congestion due to 
travel  to  and  from  work),  whereas  after  9  pm  accessibility  is  maximum  (free  flow).  When 
congestion levels remain fixed (dynamic attractiveness scenario), accessibility is above average 
until  7:30  pm  (except  at  lunchtime),  when the  population  is  concentrated  in the  centre  (the 
most  easily  accessible  space),  but  it  falls  below  average  at  the  end  of  the  day  when  the 
population tends to disperse around residential areas in the suburbs (less accessible than the 
centre).  

Therefore,  the  dynamics  for  congestion  and  destination  attractiveness  represent  opposing 
forces  that  tend  to  offset  each  other.  For  example,  in  the  early  hours  of  the  morning  the 
population is concentrated in the centre (which increases accessibility), but congestion levels 
are high (which reduces accessibility). This means that the dynamic accessibility curve is almost 
always located between the  curves  for the dynamic congestion and attractiveness  scenarios, 
although  the  fact  that  it  is  located  closer  to  the  first  than  the  second  indicates  that  the 
variation in congestion outweighs the variation in destination attractiveness. In fact, the lowest 
dynamic accessibility values occur  at  the morning and afternoon  peak times, although  this is 
when the population tends to be concentrated in the centre (see also Table 3). 

Figure 2: Changes in average accessibility every 15 mins according to scenarios 

 

 

In  general  terms  the  average  values  of  each  scenario  reveal  the  pattern  of  dynamic 
accessibility  and  the  role  played  by  the  two  dynamic  variables  (network  congestion  and 
destination  attractiveness)  in  the  whole  of  the  metropolitan  area  of  Madrid,  taking  the 
reference  scenario  as  the  element  for  comparison.  However,  this  general  pattern  conceals 
major differences in the profiles of the different transport zones. As it is impossible to analyse 
the  profiles  of  each  zone,  we  have  selected  three  that  have  locations  and  features  that  are 

 

10 

representative of the internal discrepancies in the metropolitan area: a) a residential city in the 
suburban south b) the city centre; c) an area of activity in the north (the headquarters of the 
multinational company Telefónica); and (Figure 3). In the reference scenario, the accessibility 
values  for  the  second  zone  (centre)  are  substantially  higher  than  the  average  for  the 
metropolitan  area  (almost  10,000  units),  intermediate  (5,000)  in  the  third  (north),  and  far 
below  average  (4,400)  in  the  first  (south).  The  curves  for  temporal  changes  in  dynamic 
accessibility are very different: 

a)  The  residential  city  in  the  metropolitan  south  reveals  a  very  marked  decline  in 
accessibility  due  to  the  effects  of  congestion  at  the  morning  peak  time  (Figure  3a) 
when there is a predominance of journeys from the suburbs to the centre. Unlike the 
general  profile  for  the metropolitan  area,  the  dynamic  population  distribution  at  the 
morning and evening peak times does not tend to offset the loss of accessibility due to 
congestion but instead reinforces it, as the city loses population during these periods 
owing  to  its  residential  character.  In  the  central  hours  of  the  day  this  space  suffers 
barely any congestion, and the dynamic accessibility is similar to that of the reference 
scenario.  

b)  The  central  transport  zone  is  not  affected  by  congestion  in  the  early  hours of  the 
morning  when  there  is  a  predominance  of  inbound  journeys,  so  its  dynamic 
accessibility is higher than the static average in this time period (Figure 3b). However, 
it is significantly affected by congestion in the central hours of the day and particularly 
at the afternoon peak time, when the population begins to leave the centre to travel 
to the suburbs. The curve for the dynamic attractiveness scenario is significantly higher 
than the reference scenario in both the morning and afternoon, as the centre contains 
a substantial proportion of the population at these times.  

c)  Finally,  the  area  of  economic  activity  in  the  north  of  the  city  is  very  sensitive  to 
congestion  at  the  afternoon  peak  time  (Figure  3c),  coinciding  with  the  time  people 
leave work. Dynamic accessibility is higher than static accessibility during the morning 
(until 2:30 pm), which is explained by the population concentration and the alleviation 
of  congestion  in  the  outbound  journeys.  At  night  the  dynamic  accessibility  is  higher 
than the static average in all three spaces. 

In  short,  the  dynamic  accessibility  profiles  in  the  three  transport  zones  are  the  result  of  the 
interplay  of  the  opposing  forces  of  the  congestion  dynamic  and  population  density.  In  the 
centre, the population concentration and the low congestion in the early hours of the morning 
combine  to  create  a  situation  of  greater  accessibility.  At  the  end  of  the  afternoon,  the  high 
population  concentration counteracts  the  impact of congestion.  However,  during  the  central 
hours of the day, the population concentration does not offset the effects of road congestion. 
This situation is repeated in the north, where the high population concentration compensates 
for  the  effects  of  congestion  in  the  morning,  but  not  in  the  afternoon  peak  time.  In  the 
residential area in the metropolitan south, the population dynamic is more stable than in the 
two  previous  zones,  though  the  dynamic  accessibility  profile  is  more  similar  to  that  of  the 
dynamic  congestion  scenario.  The  most  important  finding  is  that  the  population  dynamic 
reinforces  (rather  than  offsets)  the  effects  of  network  congestion,  reducing  dynamic 
accessibility at the morning and afternoon peak times and increasing it at the end of the day.

representative transport zones in the metropolitan area of Madrid. 

 

Another way of analysing the variability in dynamic accessibility according to transport zones is 
to map the differences between the assessment scenarios and the reference scenario in each 
zone  at  several  times  of  day.  In  the  reference  scenario  (Figure  4)  the  spatial  distribution  of 
accessibility  shows  a  characteristic  centre-suburban  pattern.  The  highest  accessibility  is 
recorded  in  the  central  transport  zones  with  a  high  land-use  intensity  (concentration  of 
activities and/or population), whereas in the suburbs the accessibility values are much lower. 
However, the spatial distribution varies throughout the day. To analyse the dynamic scenarios 
in  detail,  three  times  were  selected,  corresponding  to  the  morning  peak  time,  the  morning 
valley,  and  the  afternoon  peak  time.  To  observe  the  differences  more  clearly,  each  of  the 
dynamic  scenarios  is  compared  to  the  reference  scenario  at  those  three  times  (Figure  5). 
Additionally, three videos have been produced showing these differences throughout the full 
day (videos 3 to 5).  

The comparison between the dynamic congestion scenario and the reference scenario (Figure 
5a and video 3) shows very marked differences for the journeys that reach their destination at 
8:30 am (maximum congestion), less marked at 5:30 pm (start of the afternoon peak time) and 
practically non-existent at midday (average congestion). These results are consistent with the 
curves in Figure 1 and with Tables 2 and 3, but they raise some further considerations that are 
worth exploring. The transport zones in the south, east and west register the greatest negative 
differences in accessibility in the morning peak, whereas the situation improves in the centre 
and north, which concentrate a large proportion of employment, and where there is therefore 
a predominance of inbound rather than outbound journeys at that time of day. Practically the 
opposite  situation  occurs  at  the  start  of  the  afternoon  peak  time:  the  greatest  negative 
differences  correspond to the  centre  and particularly the north. The  flows  are now  reversed 
compared  to  the  morning,  and  these  areas  that  concentrate  a  large  volume  of  employment 
now begin to register high congestion in outbound journeys. 

The  comparison  between  the  dynamic  attractiveness  scenario  and  the  reference  scenario 
(Figure 5b and video 4) reveals significant differences at 8:30 am, but in the positive sense. The 
increase  in  population  density  in  the  centre  and  north  causes  an  increase  in  accessibility  in 
these areas, which contain a high concentration of jobs.   

 

12 

The  dynamic  accessibility scenario  is the  result  of  the  joint  effect  of  the  changes  in  network 
congestion  and  the  attractiveness  of  the  destinations,  with  a  much  greater  influence  of  the 
first  than the second  (Figure  5c and video 5).  In fact,  Figures 5a  and 5c  are very similar. The 
most  important  difference  is  the  reinforcement  of  the  effects  of  network  performance  and 
population  concentration  in  the  city  centre  at  the  morning  peak  time.  The  general  resulting 
sequence can be seen in the vide 5 and reveals how the southern, eastern and western zones 
are  the  most  negatively  affected  at  the morning  peak  time, whereas  the  areas  in  the  centre 
and north are most adversely affected during the afternoon peak, essentially due to the effects 
of congestion.

Figure 5: Differences between the dynamic scenarios and the reference scenario 

Finally,  the  coefficient  of  variation  in  accessibility  between  transport  zones  and  within  each 
transport  zone  was  calculated  in  each  scenario.  The aim  of the  first  is  to  analyse  the  spatial 
variability  between  transport  zones  and  identify  the  times  and  scenarios  with  the  most 
homogeneous distribution, while the second identifies the temporal variability in accessibility 
in  each  transport  zone  in  order  to  differentiate  the  transport  zones  that  have  a  greater 
temporal stability from those that have greater variability. 

 

 

in  accessibility 

Tables  2  and  3  show  the  descriptive  statistics  for  accessibility  in  the  static  and  dynamic 
scenarios  respectively.  To  facilitate  comparison  between  the  dynamic  scenarios  and  the 
reference scenario, the differences were calculated between the values in each scenario and 
the  reference  scenario  and  expressed  in  the  form  of  ratios.  At  the  morning  peak  time  the 
discrepancies 
increase 
compared to the reference scenario (ratios of 1.09 and 1.03, respectively), producing a 9% and 
3%  higher  coefficient  of  variation  (variability  between  transport  zones)  in  these  dynamic 
scenarios than  in  the  reference  scenario. Figure 5 shows  that  the more  suburban  areas with 
poorer  accessibility  suffer  greater  effects  of  congestion  at  this  time,  while  the  central  areas 
(centre-north)  benefit  from  an  increase  in  population.  Both  effects  are  self-reinforcing  and 
lead to a considerable increase in inequalities in the dynamic accessibility scenario compared 
to the reference scenario (ratio of 1:13).   

in  both  congestion  and  population  distribution 

At the start of the afternoon peak time the increase in the discrepancies between the dynamic 
accessibility  scenario  and  the  reference  scenario  is  weak  (ratio  of  1:03),  owing  to  the 
concentration of activities (ratio of 1.03) rather than to congestion (ratio of 1.00), whereas at 
midday the reduction in congestion (ratio 0.98) also produces a decrease in the discrepancies 
in dynamic accessibility (0.98).

Figure 6 shows the temporal variability in accessibility in each transport zone in the dynamic 
scenarios.  In  the  dynamic  accessibility  scenario  (Figure  6c),  the  centre,  and  the  north  to  a 
minor degree, present the lowest variation coefficients. Once again this distribution is a result 

 

15 

of the interplay between the network congestion  dynamic and the destination attractiveness 
dynamic.  Congestion  generates  more  uneven  accessibility  profiles  (Figure  6a),  and  has  a 
greater effect on the more suburban areas. The population density dynamic has less effect on 
the daily variation in accessibility in each zone (Figure 6b), but more in the centre and north of 
the city.

6 CONCLUSIONS 

The  new  data  sources  offer  new  possibilities  for  the  dynamic  analysis  of  accessibility.  The 
recent  availability  of  traffic  data  from  commercial  navigation  companies  (TomTom,  Nokia 
Here, Garmin), and as (limited) open data (Google), is a genuine leap forwards for the study of 
dynamic travel times. In addition, data on people’s location during the day is becoming more 
spatially  and  temporally  disaggregated,  thus  contributing  to  greater  detail  in  the  land-use 
aspect of accessibility measures. For example, geolocated tweets can be downloaded free of 
charge and used to map the intensity of use of each part of the city during the day. 

In this research we have used the increasing availability of big data to overcome the temporal 
restrictions  of  previous  studies  at  the  urban  scale.  We  consider  the  two  components  of 
accessibility dynamically: travel times to reach the destinations, and the attractiveness of the 
destinations themselves. For the first we use data from the TomTom company, which provides 
travel times for each section of the network in 15-minute intervals. For the second we use the 
number of active tweeters in each transport zone in 15 minute intervals as a proxy. These data 
highlight  the  variation in the  spatial distribution of the  population depending on the time of 
day, and show that it tends to be concentrated in the centre in the morning and afternoon and 
in residential areas in the suburbs at night.  

The results of the dynamic accessibility analyses reveal that in general the poorest accessibility 
conditions  are  recorded  at  the  morning  and  afternoon  peak  times  due  to  the  increase  in 
congestion,  although  its  effects  are  partially  offset  by  the  distribution  of  the  population 
density,  which increases in the  city centre  at  these times. As expected, the best  accessibility 
conditions  occur  at  night  in  a  situation  of  free  flow,  although  the  population  tends  to  be 
dispersed throughout the suburbs.   

 

16 

[0.0, 2.5](2.5, 5.0](5.0, 7.5](7.5, 10.0](10.0, inf)These general results conceal marked contrasts between transport areas. The distribution of 
accessibility in the reference scenario shows a typical accessibility gradient between the centre 
and the suburbs in an average congestion scenario and an average distribution of population 
densities. However, these accessibility conditions change  significantly  depending on  the time 
of  day.  At  the  morning  peak  time  the  greatest  decrease  in  accessibility  occurs  in  suburban 
residential  zones,  as  the  predominance  of  inbound  travel  causes  serious  problems  of 
congestion,  while  the  population  tends  to  be  concentrated  in  the  centre.  In  contrast,  at  the 
afternoon  peak  time  the  transport  zones  in  the centre  and  north,  which  contain  the  highest 
proportion  of  jobs,  are  the  most  negatively  affected  by  the  effects  of  congestion,  at  a  time 
when  outbound journeys predominate. The  calculation of the  coefficients of variation of the 
profiles  of  each  transport  zone  shows  that  in  general  the  transport  zones  in  the  suburbs 
register a greater temporal variation in their accessibility conditions.  

Dynamics  of  accessibility  throughout  the  day  give  policymakers  greater 
into 
accessibility  issues  that  are  otherwise  masked  in  static  accessibility  analyses.  Accessibility 
conditions change throughout the day, as do the causes of these changes, namely congestion 
in  the  road  network  and  the  population  distribution  in  the  city.  Each  transport  zone  has  its 
own accessibility profile, and thus its own specific problems, which require solutions that are 
also specific.  

insight 

This  research  also  represents  a  further step  forward  for  accessibility  analyses  by  considering 
the  two  accessibility  components  dynamically  and  determining  which  one  has  the  greatest 
impact  in  each  transport  zone  and  at  each  time  of  day.  However,  the  work  has  certain 
limitations that can be overcome in future research. The analysis of geolocated tweets shows 
that, as expected, the density of tweeters varies considerably throughout the day, increasing in 
areas  of  activity  during  the  daytime  and  in  residential  areas  at  night.  However,  Twitter  is  a 
fairly biased source and is possibly not the most effective for use as a proxy for the variation in 
population  density  throughout  the  day.  In  future  work  we  will  use  data  from  more  reliable 
sources  than  Twitter  –specifically  mobile  phone  data–  to  consider  the  time  variation  in  the 
available activities. The analysis of dynamic accessibility in public transport is beyond the scope 
of  this  research,  but  it  will  be  examined  in  the  future  using  data  from  Google  Transit  and 
mobile phones.
