Abstract Measuring centrality in a social network, es-
pecially in bipartite mode, poses many challenges. For
example, the requirement of full knowledge of the net-
work topology, and the lack of properly detecting top-k
behavioral representative users. To overcome the above
mentioned challenges, we propose HellRank, an accu-
rate centrality measure for identifying central nodes
in bipartite social networks. HellRank is based on the
Hellinger distance between two nodes on the same side
of a bipartite network. We theoretically analyze the im-
pact of this distance on a bipartite network and ﬁnd
upper and lower bounds for it. The computation of the
HellRank centrality measure can be distributed, by let-
ting each node uses local information only on its im-
mediate neighbors. Consequently, one does not need a
central entity that has full knowledge of the network
topological structure. We experimentally evaluate the
performance of the HellRank measure in correlation
with other centrality measures on real-world networks.
The results show partial ranking similarity between the
HellRank and the other conventional metrics according
to the Kendall and Spearman rank correlation coeﬃ-
cient.

1 Introduction

Social networks have become a very important social
structure of our modern society with hundreds of mil-
lions of users nowadays. With the growth of informa-
tion spread across various social networks, the question
of “how to measure the relative importance of users in
a social network?” has become increasingly challenging
and interesting, as important users are more likely to be
infected by, or to infect, a large number of users. Under-
standing users’ behaviors when they connect to social
networking sites creates opportunities for richer stud-
ies of social interactions. Also, ﬁnding a subset of users
to statistically represent the original social network is a
fundamental issue in social network analysis. This small
subset of users (the behaviorally-representative users)
usually plays an important role in inﬂuencing the social
dynamics on behavior and structure.

The centrality measure is widely used in social net-
work analysis to quantify the relative importance of
nodes within a network. The most central nodes are
often the nodes that have more weight, both in terms
of the number of interactions as well as the number of
connections to other nodes [63]. In social network anal-
ysis, such a centrality notion is used to identify inﬂuen-
tial users [44,63, 76, 80], as the inﬂuence of a user is the
ability to popularize a particular content in the social
network. To this end, various centrality measures have
been proposed over the years to rank the network nodes
according to their topological and structural properties
[11,23,82]. These measures can be considered as several
points of view with diﬀerent computational complexity,
ranging from low-cost measures (e.g., Degree centrality)
to more costly measures (e.g., Betweenness and Close-
ness centralities) [75,53]. The authors of [65] concluded

Another interesting observation is that the com-
mon centrality measures are typically deﬁned for non-
bipartite networks. To use these measures in bipartite
networks, diﬀerent projection methods have been intro-
duced to converting bipartite to monopartite networks
[83,62]. In these methods, a bipartite network is pro-
jected by considering one of the two node sets and if
each pair of these nodes shares a neighbor in the net-
work, two nodes will be connected in the projected one-
mode network [37,41]. One of the major challenges is
that every link in a real network is formed indepen-
dently, but this does not happen in the projected one-
mode network. Because of lack of independency in the
formation of links in the projected network, analysis of
the metrics that use the random network [7] as a ba-
sis for their approach, is diﬃcult. Classic random net-
works are formed by assuming that links are being in-
dependent from each other [57]. The second challenge is
that the projected bipartite network nodes tend to form
Cliques. A clique is a fully connected subset of nodes
that all of its members are neighbors. As a result, the
metrics that are based on triangles (i.e., a clique on
three nodes) in the network, can be ineﬃcient (such as
structural holes or clustering coeﬃcient measures) [42,
57].

Despite the fact that the projected one-mode net-
work is less informative than its corresponding bipartite
representation, some of the measures for monopartite
networks have been extended to bipartite mode [33,57].
Moreover, because of requirement of full knowledge of
network topology and lack of proper measure for detec-
tion of more behavioral representative users in bipartite
social networks, the use of conventional centrality mea-
sures in the large-scale networks (e.g. in recommender
systems) is a challenging issue. In order to overcome
the aforementioned challenges and retain the original
information in bipartite networks, proposing an accu-
rate centrality measure in such networks seems essential
[31,41].

Motivated by these observations and taking into ac-
count users’ importance indicators for detection of cen-
tral nodes in social recommender systems, we introduce
a new centrality measure, called HellRank. This mea-
sure identiﬁes central nodes in bipartite social networks.
HellRank is based on the Hellinger distance[55], a type
of f-divergence measure, that indicates structural sim-
ilarity of each node to other network nodes. Hence,
this distance-based measure is accurate for detecting
the more behavioral representative nodes. We empir-
ically show that nodes with high HellRank centrality
measure have relatively high Degree, Betweenness and
PageRank centrality measures in bipartite networks. In
the proposed measure, despite of diﬀerent objectives to

nodes set V1 = {A, B, C, D}, V2 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7} and link
set E that each link connects a node in V1 to a node in V2.

that centrality may not be restricted to shortest paths.
In general, the global topological structure of many net-
works is initially unknown. However, all these structural
network metrics require full knowledge of the network
topology [75,48].

An interesting observation is that many real-world
social networks have a bi-modal nature that allows the
network to be modeled as a bipartite graph (see Fig-
ure 1). In a bipartite network, there are two types of
nodes and the links can only connect nodes of diﬀer-
ent types [82]. The Social Recommender System is one
of the most important systems that can be modeled
as a bipartite graph with users and items as the two
types of nodes, respectively. In such systems, the cen-
trality measure can have diﬀerent interpretations from
conventional centrality measures such as Betweenness,
Closeness, Degree, and PageRank [32]. The structural
metrics, such as Betweenness and Closeness centrality,
are known as the most common central nodes’ identi-
ﬁer in one-mode networks, although in bipartite social
networks they are not usually appropriate in identify-
ing central users that are perfect representative for the
bipartite network structure. For example, in a social
recommender system [45,68], that can be modeled by
the network graph in Figure 1, user D ∈ V1 is associ-
ated with items that have too low connections and have
been considered less often by other users; meanwhile
user D is considered as the most central node based on
these common centrality metrics, because it has more
connections. However user B ∈ V1 is much more a real
representative than D in the network. In the real-world
example of an online store, if one user buys a lot of
goods, but these goods are low consumption, and an-
other buys fewer goods, but these are widely, we treat
the second user as being a synechdochic representative
of all users of the store. This is quite diﬀerent from a
conventional centrality metric outcome.

identify central nodes, there is a partial correlation be-
tween HellRank and other common metrics.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Sec-
tion 2, we discuss related work on behavioral represen-
tative and inﬂuence identiﬁcation mechanisms. We also
discuss centrality measures for bipartite networks, and
highlight the research gap between our objectives and
previous work. In Section 3, we introduce our proposed
measure to solve the problem of centrality in bipartite
networks. Experimental results and discussions are pre-
sented in Section 4. We conclude our work and discuss
the future works in Section 5.

2 Related Work

We organize the relevant studies on social inﬂuence
analysis and the problem of important users in three
diﬀerent categories. First, in Section 2.1, we study ex-
isting work on behavioral representative users detection
methods in social networks. Second, in Section 2.2, we
review previous mechanisms for identifying inﬂuential
users in social networks by considering the inﬂuence as
a measure of the relative importance. Third, in Section
2.3, we focus in more details on centrality measures for
bipartite networks.

2.1 Behavioral Representative Users Detection

Unlike inﬂuence maximization, in which the goal is to
ﬁnd a set of nodes in a social network who can max-
imize the spread of inﬂuence [13,30], the objective of
behavioral representative users detection is to identify
a few average users who can statistically represent the
characteristics of all users [36]. Another type of related
work is social inﬂuence analysis. [3] and [64] proposed
methods to qualitatively measure the existence of in-
ﬂuence. [14] studied the correlation between social sim-
ilarity and inﬂuence. [69] presented a method for mea-
suring the strength of such inﬂuence. The problem of
sampling representative users from social networks is
also relevant to graph sampling [39,51,74]. [84] intro-
duced a novel ranking algorithm called GRASSHOP-
PER, which ranks items with an emphasis on diversity.
Their algorithm is based on random walks in an absorb-
ing Markov chain. [5] presented a comprehensive view
of user behavior by characterizing the type, frequency,
and sequence of activities users engage in and described
representative user behaviors in online social networks
based on clickstream data. [24] found signiﬁcant diver-
sity in end-host behavior across environments for many
features, thus indicating that proﬁles computed for a

user in one environment yield inaccurate representa-
tions of the same user in a diﬀerent environment. [50]
proposed a methodology for characterizing and identi-
fying user behaviors in online social networks.

However, most existing work focused on studying
the network topology and ignored the topic informa-
tion. [67] aimed to ﬁnd representative users from the
information spreading perspective and [2] studied the
network sampling problem in the dynamic environment.
[59] presented a sampling-based algorithm to eﬃciently
explore a user’s ego network and to quickly approxi-
mate quantities of interest. [17] focused on the use of
the social structure of the user community, user pro-
ﬁles and previous behaviors, as an additional source of
information in building recommender systems. [71] pre-
sented a formal deﬁnition of the problem of sampling
representative users from social network.

2.2 Identifying Inﬂuential Users

[25] studied how to infer social probabilities of inﬂu-
ence by developing an algorithm to scan over the log of
actions of social network users using real data. [6, 70] fo-
cused on the inﬂuence maximization problem to model
the social inﬂuence on large networks. TwitterRank, as
an extension of PageRank metric, was proposed by [77]
to identify inﬂuential users in Twitter. [12] used the
Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model to exam-
ine the spreading inﬂuence of the nodes ranked by dif-
ferent inﬂuence measures. [78] identiﬁed inﬂuencers us-
ing joint inﬂuence powers through Inﬂuence network.
[85] identiﬁed inﬂuencial users by using user trust net-
works. [40] proposed the weighted LeaderRank tech-
nique by replacing the standard random walk to a bi-
ased random walk. [66] presented a novel analysis on the
statistical simplex as a manifold with boundary and ap-
plied the proposed technique to social network analysis
to rank a subset of inﬂuencer nodes. [72] proposed a new
approach to incorporate users’ reply relationship, con-
versation content and response immediacy to identify
inﬂuential users of online health care community. [19]
used multi-attribute and homophily characteristics in
a new method to identify inﬂuential nodes in complex
networks.

In the speciﬁc area of identifying inﬂuential users
in bipartite networks, [4] presented a dynamical model
for rewiring in bipartite networks and obtained time-
dependent degree distributions. [41] deﬁned a bipartite
clustering coeﬃcient by taking diﬀerently structured
clusters into account, that can ﬁnd important nodes
across communities. The concept of clustering coeﬃ-
cient will be discussed in further detail in the Section
2.2.1.

2.2.1 Clustering Coeﬃcient

This measure shows the nodes’ tendency to form clus-
ters and has attracted a lot of attention in both empiri-
cal and theoretical work. In many real-world networks,
especially social networks, nodes are inclined to cluster
in densely connected groups [58]. Many measures have
been proposed to examine this tendency. In particu-
lar, the global clustering coeﬃcient provides an overall
assessment of clustering in the network [43], and the lo-
cal clustering coeﬃcient evaluates the clustering value
of the immediate neighbors of a node in the network
[18].

The global clustering coeﬃcient is the fraction of
2-paths (i.e., three nodes connected by two links) that
are closed by the presence of a link between the ﬁrst
and the third node in the network. The local clustering
coeﬃcient is the fraction of the links among a node’s
interactions over the maximum possible number of links
between them [18, 57].

Due to structural diﬀerences, applying these gen-
eral clustering coeﬃcients directly to a bipartite net-
work, is clearly not appropriate [9], Thus the common
metrics were extended or redeﬁned, and diﬀerent clus-
tering measures were deﬁned in these networks. In one
of the most common clustering coeﬃcients in bipartite
networks, 4-period density is measured instead of trian-
gles [60,81]. However, this measure could not consider
the triple closure concept in the clustering as it actu-
ally consists of two nodes. This kind of measure can
only be a measure of the level of support between two
nodes rather than the clustering of a group of nodes.
Accordingly, [37] deﬁned the notion of clustering coeﬃ-
cient for pairs of nodes capturing correlations between
neighborhoods in the bipartite case. Addtionally, [57]
considered the factor, C∗, as the ratio of the number of
∆) to the number of 4-paths (τ∗), as:

2.3 Centrality Measures for Bipartite Networks

Various deﬁnitions for centrality have been proposed in
which centrality of a node in a network is generally in-
terpreted as the relative importance of that node [22,
12]. Centrality measures has attracted a lot of atten-
tions as a tool to analyze various kinds of networks
(e.g. social, information, and biological networks) [20,
29]. In this section, we consider a set of well-known
centrality measures including Degree, Closeness, Be-
tweenness, Eigenvector and PageRank, all of them re-
deﬁned for bipartite networks. Given bipartite network

G = (V1, V2, E), where V1 and V2 are the two sides of
network with |V1| = n1 and |V2| = n2. The link set E
includes all links connecting nodes of V1 to nodes of V2.
For the network in Figure 1, n1 and n2 are equal to 4
and 7, respectively. Let Adj be the adjacency matrix of
this network, as shown below:

Adj(G) =

2.3.1 Degree Centrality

In one-mode graphs, Degree centrality of node i, di,
is equal to the number of connections of that node.
In bipartite graphs, it indicates the number of node’s
connections to members on the other side. For easier
comparison, Degree centrality is normalized: the degree
of each node is divided by the size of the other node set.
Let d∗
i be the normalized Degree centrality of node i.
This is equal to [9,20]:
d∗
i =

i ∈ V1, j ∈ V2

, d∗

j =

;

di

As the network size becomes increasingly large, em-
ploying Degree centrality is the best option [79]. On
the other hand, this centrality is based on a highly lo-
cal view around each node. As a consequence, we need
more informative measures that can further distinguish
among nodes with the same degree [29].

2.3.2 Closeness Centrality

The standard deﬁnition of Closeness ci for node i in
monopartite networks, refers to the sum of geodesic
distances from node i to all n − 1 other nodes in the
network with n nodes [61]. For bipartite networks, this
measure can be calculated using the same approach,
but the main diﬀerence is normalization. Let c∗
i be the
normalized Closeness centrality of node i ∈ V1. This is
equal to [9,20]:
c∗
i =

n2 + 2(n1 − 1)

For the bipartite network shown in Figure 1, nor-
malized Closeness centrality of the nodes A, B, C and
D are respectively equal to 0.35, 0.61, 0.52 and 0.68.
It speciﬁes that node D is the most central node which
says that Closeness centrality cannot help us very much
in the objective to ﬁnding more behavioral representa-
tive nodes in bipartite social networks.

2.3.3 Betweenness Centrality

Betweenness centrality of node i, bi, refers to the frac-
tion of shortest paths in the network that pass through
node i [21]. In bipartite networks, maximum possible
Betweenness for each node is limited by relative size of
two nodes sets, as introduced by [10]:

bmax(V1) =

2(s + 1)2 +

1
[n2
2
n2(s + 1)(2t − s − 1) − t(2s − t + 3)]

(6)
where s = (n1− 1) div n2 and t = (n1− 1) mod n2; and

bmax(V2) =

1(p + 1)2 +

1
[n2
2
n1(p + 1)(2r − p − 1) − r(2p − r + 3)]

(7)

where p = (n2 − 1) div n1 and r = (n2 − 1) mod n1.

For the bipartite network shown in Figure 1, nor-
malized Betweenness centrality of the nodes A, B, C
and D are respectively equal to 0, 0.45, 0.71 and 0.71.
It speciﬁes that nodes C and D are the most central
nodes which says that Betweenness centrality cannot
help us much objective in ﬁnding more behavioral rep-
resentative nodes in bipartite social networks.

2.3.4 Eigenvector and PageRank Centrality

(cid:88)

Another important centrality measure is Eigenvector
centrality, which is deﬁned as the principal eigenvector
of adjacency matrix of the network. A node’s score is
proportional to the sum of the scores of its immediate
neighbors. This measures exploits the idea that nodes
with connections to high-score nodes are more central
[8]. The eigenvector centrality of node i, ei, is deﬁned
as follows [20]:

ei = λ

aijej

(8)

where Adj(G) = (aij)n
i,j=1 denotes the adjacency ma-
trix of the network with n nodes and λ is the prin-
cipal eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix. Our interest
regarding to the eigenvector centrality is particularly fo-
cused on the distributed computation of PageRank [79].
The PageRank is a special case of eigenvector central-
ity when the adjacency matrix is suitably normalized
to obtain a column stochastic matrix [79]. The PageR-
ank vector R = (r1, r2, . . . , rn)T is the solution of the
following equation:

1 − d
n

R =

.1 + dLR

(9)

where ri is the PageRank of node i and n is the total
number of nodes. d is a damping factor, set to around
0.85 and L is a modiﬁed adjacency matrix, such that
li,j = 0 if and only if node j does not have a link to i

, and dj =(cid:80)n

5

i=1 ai,j

i=1 li,j = 1, where li,j = ai,j
dj

is the out-degree of node j [56].

For the bipartite network shown in Figure 1, nor-
malized PageRank centrality of the nodes A, B, C and
D are respectively equal to 0.05, 0.11, 0.08 and 0.21. It
speciﬁes that node D is the most central node which
says that PageRank centrality cannot help us much ob-
jective to ﬁnding more behavioral representative nodes
in bipartite social networks.

3 Proposed Method

In this paper, we want to identify more behavioral rep-
resentative nodes in bipartite social networks. To this
end, we propose a new similarity-based centrality mea-
sure, called HellRank. Since the similarity measure is
usually inverse of the distance metrics, we ﬁrst choose
a suitable distance measure, namely Hellinger distance
(Section 3.1). Then we apply this metric to bipartite
networks. After that, we theoretically analyze the im-
pact of the distance metric in the bipartite networks.
Next, we generate a distance matrix on one side of the
network. Finally, we compute the HellRank score of
each node, accordingly to this matrix. As a result, the
nodes with high HellRank centrality are more behav-
ioral representative nodes in bipartite social networks.

3.1 Select A Well-Deﬁned Distance Metric

When we want to choose a base metric, an important
point is whether this measure is based on a well-deﬁned
mathematical metric. We want to introduce a similarity-
based measure for each pair of nodes in the network. So,
we choose a proper distance measure as base metric,
because the similarity measures are in some sense the
inverse of the distance metrics. A true distance met-
ric must have several main characteristics. A metric
with these characteristics on a space induces topolog-
ical properties (like open and closed sets). It leads to
the study of more abstract topological spaces. [27] in-
troduced the following deﬁnition for a distance metric.

Deﬁnition 1 A metric space is a set X that has a
notion of the distance function d(x, y) between every
pair of points x, y ∈ X. A well-deﬁned distance metric
d on a set X is a function d : X × X → IR such that
for all x, y, z ∈ X, three properties hold:
1. Positive Deﬁniteness: d(x, y) ≥ 0 and d(x, y) = 0 if

and only if x = y;

2. Symmetry: d(x, y) = d(y, x);
3. Triangle Inequality: d(x, y) ≤ d(x, z) + d(z, y).

We deﬁne our distance function as the diﬀerence
between probability distribution for each pair of nodes
based on f-divergence function, which is deﬁned by [15]:
Deﬁnition 2 An f -divergence is a function Df (P||Q)
that measures the diﬀerence between two probability
distributions P and Q. For a convex function f with
f (1) = 0, the f -divergence of Q from P is deﬁned as:
Df (P||Q) =

(cid:90)

(10)

)dQ

f (

dP
dQ

Ω

where Ω is a sample space, which is the set of all pos-
sible outcomes.

In this paper, we use one type of the f-divergence
metric, called Hellinger distance (aka Bhattacharyya
distance), that was introduced by Ernst Hellinger in
1909 [55]. In probability theory and information theory,
Kullback-Leibler divergence [35] is a more common
measure of diﬀerence between two probability distribu-
tions, however it does not satisfy both the symmetry
and the triangle inequality conditions [52]. Thus, this
measure is not intuitively appropriate to explain simi-
larity in our problem. As a result, we choose Hellinger
distance to quantify the similarity between two prob-
ability distributions [52]. For two discrete probability
distributions P = (p1, . . . , pm) and Q = (q1, . . . , qm),
in which m is length of the vectors, Hellinger distance
is deﬁned as:

DH (P||Q) =

3.2 Applying Hellinger distance in Bipartite Networks

In this Section, we want to apply the Hellinger distance
to a bipartite network for measuring the similarity of
the nodes on one side of the network. Assume x is a
node in a bipartite network in which its neighborhood
is N (x) and its degree is deg(x) = |N (x)|. Suppose that
the greatest node degree of the network is ∆. Let li be
the number of x’s neighbors with degree of i. Suppose
the vector Lx = (l1, . . . , l∆) be the non-normalized dis-
tribution of li for all adjacent neighbors of x. Now, we
introduce the Hellinger distance between two nodes x
and y on one side of the bipartite network as follows:

d(x, y) =

2 DH (Lx(cid:107)Ly)

(13)

√

The function d(x, y) represents the diﬀerence between
two probability distribution of Lx and Ly. To the best

of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst work that introduces
the Hellinger distance between each pair of nodes in a
bipartite network, using degree distribution of neigh-
bors of each node.

3.3 Theoretical Analysis

In this Section, we ﬁrst express the Hellinger distance
for all positive real vectors to show that applying this
distance to bipartite networks still satisﬁes its metric-
ity (lemma 1) according to Deﬁnition 1. Then, we ﬁnd
an upper and a lower bound for the Hellinger distance
between two nodes of bipartite network.

Lemma 1 Hellinger distance for all positive real vec-
tors is a well-deﬁned distance metric function.

Proof Based on the true metric properties in Deﬁnition
1, for two probability distribution vectors P and Q, the
following holds:
DH (P(cid:107)Q) ≥ 0
DH (P(cid:107)Q) = 0 ⇔ P = Q
DH (P(cid:107)Q) = DH (Q(cid:107)P )

(14)

(15)

(16)

P −(cid:112)Q(cid:107)2 ≤ 1√

If we have another probability distribution R similar
to P and Q, then according to the triangle inequality
in norm 2, we should have:

Using this distance measure, we have the ability to
detect diﬀerences between local structures of nodes. In
other words, this distance expresses similarity between
the local structures of two nodes. If we normalize the
vectors (i.e., sum of the elements equals to one), then
diﬀerences between local structures of nodes may not
be observed. For example, there does not exist any dis-
tance between node x with deg(x) = 10 that its neigh-
bors’ degree are 2 and node y with deg(y) = 1 that its
neighbor’s degree are 2. Therefore, our distance mea-
sure with vectors normalization is not proper for com-
paring two nodes.

Then, we claim that if the diﬀerence between two
nodes’ degree is greater (or smaller) than a certain
value, the distance between these nodes cannot be less
(or more) than a certain value. In other words, their
local structures cannot be similar more (or less) than
a certain value. In the following theorem, we ﬁnd an

So, the lower bound for distance of any pair of nodes
on one side of the bipartite network could not be less
than a certain value by increasing their degrees diﬀer-
ence.

Now, we want to ﬁnd an upper bound according to
Equation (19). As we know, the following statement is
true for any pi, pj and qi, qj:

We can conclude that it is not possible for any pair of
nodes on one side of the bipartite network that their
distance to be more than a certain value by increasing
their degrees.

As a result, we found the upper and the lower bounds
for the Hellinger distance between two nodes on one side
of the bipartite network using their degrees’ diﬀerence.

3.3.1 An Example with Probabilistic View

In this example, we want to analyze the similarity among
nodes based on Hellinger distance information in an
artiﬁcial network. We examine how we can obtain re-
quired information for ﬁnding similar nodes to a spe-
ciﬁc node x as the expected value and variance of the
Hellinger distance. Suppose that in a bipartite artiﬁcial
network with |V1| = n1 nodes on one side and |V2| = n2
nodes on the other side, nodes in V1 is connected to
nodes in V2 using Erd¨os-R´enyi model G(m, p). In other

words, there is an link with probability p between two
sides of the network. Distribution function Lx of node
x ∈ V1 can be expressed as a Multinomial distribution-
form as:

According to the Central Limit Theorem [28], Bi-
nomial distribution converges to a Poisson distribution
P ois(λ) with parameter λ = (n2 − 1)p and the assump-
tion that (n2 − 1)p is ﬁxed and n2 increases. There-
fore, average distribution of P (Lx|deg(x) = k) will be
µ = (kp1, kp2, . . . , kp∆). In addition, degree distribu-
tion in Erd¨os-R´enyi model converges to Poisson distri-
bution by increasing n1 and n2 (λ = n1p for one side
of network and λ = n2p for another one).
The limit of average distribution of P (Lx|deg(x) = k)
by increasing ∆, approaches k times of a Poisson dis-
tribution. Thus, normalized Lx vector is a Poisson dis-
tribution with parameter λ = (n2 − 1)p. To ﬁnd a
threshold for positioning similar and closer nodes to
node x, we must obtain expectation and variance of
the Hellinger distance between x and the other nodes
in node set V1. Before obtaining these values, we men-
tion the following lemma to derive equal expression of
Hellinger distance and diﬀerence between typical mean
and geometric mean.

Lemma 2 Suppose two distribution probability vectors
P = (p1, . . . , pm) and Q = (q1, . . . , qm) that P is k1
times of a Poisson distribution probability vector P1 ∼
Poisson(λ1) and Q is k2 times of a Poisson distribution
probability vector P2 ∼ Poisson(λ2)1. The square of
Hellinger distance between P and Q is calculated by:

V arz∈V1 (d(x, z)) = Ez∈V1

(27)

Hence, using these parameters, the required thresh-
old for ﬁnding similar nodes to a speciﬁc node x, can
be achieved. If we want to extend our method to more
complex and realistic networks, we can assume that dis-
tribution Lx is a multiple of Poisson distribution (or any
other distribution) vector with parameter λx, in which
λx can be extracted by either the information about
structure of the network or appropriate maximum like-
lihood estimation for node x. Therefore, the threshold
will be more realistic and consistent with the structure
of the real-world networks.

3.3.2 Generalization to Weighted Bipartite Networks

The introduced distance metric function can be ex-
tended to weighted networks. The generalized Hellinger
distance between two nodes of the wighted bipartite
network can be considered as:

d(x, y) =
where Wx = (w(cid:48)

the vector of weights on the links of the network.

3.4 Rank Prediction via HellRank

In this Section, we propose a new Hellinger-based cen-
trality measure, called HellRank, for the bipartite net-
works. Now, according to the Section 3.2, we ﬁnd the
Hellinger distances between any pair of nodes in each
side of a bipartite network. Then we generate an n1×n1
distance matrix (n1 is the number of nodes in one side
of network). The Hellinger distance matrix of G shown
in Figure 1 is as follows:

Hell-M atrix(G) =

n1(cid:80)

According to the well-deﬁned metric features (in
Section 3.1) and the ability of mapping to Euclidean
space, we can cluster nodes based on their distances. It
means that any pair of nodes in the matrix with a less
distance can be placed in one cluster by speciﬁc neigh-
borhood radius. By averaging inverse of elements for
each row in the distance matrix, we get ﬁnal similarity
score (HellRank) for each node of the network, by:

z∈V1

d(x, z)

HellRank(x) =
(29)
Let HellRank∗(x) be the normalized HellRank of node
x that is equal to:
HellRank∗(x) = HellRank(x). min
z∈V1

(HellRank(z))

where minz∈V1 (HellRank(z)) is the minimum possible
HellRank for each node

A similarity measure is usually (in some sense) the
inverse of a distance metric: they take on small values
for dissimilar nodes and large values for similar nodes.
The nodes in one side with higher similarity scores rep-
resent more behavioral representation of that side of the
bipartite network. In other words, these nodes are more
similar than others to that side of the network. Hell-
Rank actually indicates structural similarity for each

node to other network nodes. For the network shown in
Figure 1, according to Hellinger distance matrix, nor-
malized HellRank of nodes A, B, C, and D are respec-
tively equal to 0.71, 1, 0.94, and 0.52. It is clear that
among all of the mentioned centrality measures in Sec-
tion 2.2, only HellRank considers node ‘B’ as a more be-
havioral representative node. Hence, sorting the nodes
based on their HellRank measures will have a better
rank prediction for nodes of the network. The nodes
with high HellRank is more similar to other nodes. In
addition, we ﬁnd nodes with less scores to identify very
speciﬁc nodes which are probably very diﬀerent from
other nodes in the network. The nodes with less Hell-
Rank are very dissimilar to other nodes on that side of
the bipartite network.

4 Experimental Evaluation

In this Section, we experimentally evaluate the perfor-
mance of the proposed HellRank measure in correla-
tion with other centrality measures on real-world net-
works. After summarizing datasets and evaluation met-
rics used in the experiments, the rest of this section ad-
dresses this goal. Finally, we present a simple example
of mapping the Hellinger distance matrix to the Eu-
clidean space to show clustering nodes based on their
distances.

4.1 Datasets

To examine a measure for detection of central nodes in
a two-mode network, South Davis women [16], is one of
the most common bipartite datasets. This network has
a group of women and a series of events as two sides of
the network. A woman linked to an event if she presents
at that event. Another data set used in the experiments
is OPSAHL-collaboration network [54], which contains
authorship links between authors and publications in
the arXiv condensed matter Section (cond-mat) with
16726 authors and 22015 articles. A link represents an
authorship connecting an author and a paper.

4.2 Evaluation Metrics

One of the most popular evaluation metrics for com-
parison of diﬀerent node ranking measures is Kendall’s
rank correlation coeﬃcient (τ ). In fact, Kendall is non-
parametric statistic that is used to measure statistical
correlation between two random variables [1]:
N<concordant pairs> − N<discordant pairs>

(30)

τ =

2 n(n − 1)

10

where N<S> is the size of set S.

Another way to evaluate ranking measures is binary
vectors for detection of top-k central nodes. All of vec-
tor’s elements are zero by default and only top-k nodes’
values are equal to 1. To compare ranking vectors with
the diﬀerent metrics, we use Spearman’s rank correla-
tion coeﬃcient (ρ) that is a non-parametric statistics to
measure the correlation coeﬃcient between two random
variables [38]:

(31)

(cid:80)
(cid:112)(cid:80)
i(xi − x)2(cid:80)
i(xi − x)(yi − y)

i(yi − y)2

ρ =

where xi and yi are ranked variables and x and y are
mean of these variables.

4.3 Correlation between HellRank and The Common
Measures

We implement our proposed HellRank measure using
available tools in NetworkX [26]. To compare our mea-
sure to the other common centrality measures such as
Latapy Clustering Coeﬃcient [Section 2.2.1], Bipartite
Degree [Section 2.3.1], Bipartite Closeness [Section 2.3.2],
Bipartite Betweenness [Section 2.3.3], and PageRank
[Section 2.3.4], we perform the tests on Southern Davis
Women dataset. In Figure 2, we observe the obtained
ratings of these metrics (normalized by maximum value)
for 18 women in the Davis dataset. In general, approx-
imate correlation can be seen between the proposed
HellRank metric and the other conventional metrics in
the women scores ranking. It shows that despite dif-
ferent objectives to identify the central users, there is
a partial correlation between HellRank and the other
metrics.

Figure 3 shows scatter plots of standard metrics ver-
sus our proposed metric, on the Davis bipartite net-
work. Each point in the scatter plot corresponds to a
women node in the network. Across all former metrics,
there exist clear linear correlations between each two
measures. More importantly, because of the possibility
of distributed computation of HellRank over the nodes,
this metric can also be used in billion-scale graphs,
while many of the most common metrics such as Close-
ness or Betweenness are limited to small networks [75].
We observe that high HellRank nodes have high bipar-
tite Betweenness, bipartite Degree, and bipartite Close-
ness. This reﬂects that high HellRank nodes have higher
chance to reach all nodes within short number of steps,
due to its larger number of connections. In contrast with
high HellRank nodes, low HellRank nodes have various
Latapy CC and projected Degree values. This implies
that the nodes which are hard to be diﬀerentiated by
these measures can be easily separated by HellRank.

To have a more analysis of the correlations between
measures, we use Kendall between ranking scores pro-
vided by diﬀerent methods in Table 1 and Spearman’s
rank correlation coeﬃcient between top k = 5 nodes in
Table 2. These tables illustrate the correlation between
each pair in bipartite centrality measures and again em-
phasizes this point that despite diﬀerent objectives to
identify the central users, there is a partial correlation
between HellRank and other common metrics.

In the next experiment, we compare the top-k cen-
tral users rankings produced by Latapy CC, PageR-
ank, Bipartite, and projected one-mode Betweenness,
Degree, Closeness, and HellRank with diﬀerent values
of k. We employ Spearman’s rank correlation coeﬃ-
cient measurement to compute the ranking similarity
between two top-k rankings. Figure 4 presents result
of Spearman’s rank correlation coeﬃcient between the
top-k rankings of HellRank and the other seven met-
rics, in terms of diﬀerent values of k. As shown in the
ﬁgure, the correlation values of top k nodes in all rank-
ings, reach almost constant limit at a speciﬁc value of
k. This certain amount of k is approximately equal 4
for all metrics. This means that the correlation does not
increase at a certain threshold for k = 4 in the Davis
dataset.

To evaluate the HellRank on a larger dataset, we
repeated all the mentioned experiments for the arXiv
cond-mat dataset. The scatter plots of standard met-
rics versus HellRank metric can be seen in Figure 5. The
results show that there exist almost linear correlations
between the two measures in Bipartite Betweenness,
Bipartite Degree and PageRank. In contrast to these
metrics, HellRank has not correlation with other met-
rics such as Bipartite Closeness, Latapy Clustering Co-
eﬃcient and Projected Degree. This implies that nodes
that are hard to be diﬀerentiated by these metrics, can
be separated easily by HellRank metric.

Moreover, Spearman’s rank correlation with diﬀer-
ent values of k in arXiv cond-mat dataset can be seen
in Figure 6. We observe the correlation values from top
k nodes in all rankings, with diﬀerent values of k, reach
almost constant limit at a speciﬁc value of k. This cer-
tain amount of k approximately equals to 1000 for all
metrics except Bipartite Closenss and Latapy CC met-
rics. This means that the correlation does not increase
at a certain threshold for k = 1000 in the arXiv cond-
mat dataset.

4.4 Mapping the Hellinger Distance Matrix to the
Euclidean Space

of mapping the Hellinger distance matrix to the Eu-

this matrix, is clustering nodes based on their distance.
This Hellinger distance matrix can then be treated as a
valued adjacency matrix2 and visualized using standard
graph layout algorithms. Figure 7 shows the result of
such an analysis on Davis dataset. This ﬁgure is a depic-
tion of Hellinger Distance for each pair of individuals,
such that a line connecting two individuals indicates
that their Hellinger distance are less than 0.50. The di-
agram clearly shows the separation of Flora and Olivia,
and the bridging position of Nora.

5 Conclusion and Future Work

In this paper, we proposed HellRank centrality measure
for properly detection of more behavioral representative
users in bipartite social networks. As opposed to previ-
ous work, by using this metric we can avoid projection
of bipartite networks into one-mode ones, which makes
it possible to take much richer information from the
two-mode networks. The computation of HellRank can
be distributed by letting each node uses only local in-
formation on its immediate neighbors. To improve the
accuracy of HellRank, we can extend the neighborhood
around each node. The HellRank centrality measure is
based on the Hellinge distance between two nodes of the
bipartite network and we theoretically ﬁnd the upper
and the lower bounds for this distance.

We experimentally evaluated HellRank on the South-
ern Women Davis dataset and the results showed that
Brenda, Evelyn, Nora, Ruth, and Theresa should be
considered as important women. Our evaluation analy-
ses depicted that the importance of a woman does not
only depend on her Degree, Betweenness, and Closeness
centralities. For instance, if Brenda with low Degree
centrality is removed from the network, the informa-
tion would not easily spread among other women. As

2 In a valued adjacency matrix, the cell entries can be any
non-negative integer, indicating the strength or number of
relations of a particular type or types [34].

another observation, Dorothy, Olivia, and Flora have
very low HellRank centralities. These results are con-
sistent with the results presented in Bonacich (1978),
Doreian (1979), and Everett and Borgatti (1993).

As a future work, more meta data information can
be taken into account besides the links in a bipartite
network. Moreover, we can consider a bipartite network
as a wighted graph [47, 49] in which the links are not
merely binary entities, either present or not, but have
associated a given wight that record their strength rela-
tive to one another. Furthermore, as HellRank measure
is proper for detection of more behavioral representa-
tive users in bipartite social network, we can use this
measure in Recommender Systems. In addition, we can
detect top k central nodes in a network with indirect
measurements and without full knowledge the network
topological structure, using compressive sensing theory
[44,46–49].
