Abstract

Crowd employment is a new form of short term and ﬂexible employment which

has emerged during the past decade. For understanding this new form of em-

ployment, it is crucial to understand the underlying motivations of the workforce

involved in it. This paper presents the Multidimensional Crowdworker Motiva-

tion Scale (MCMS), a scale for measuring the motivation of crowdworkers on

micro-task platforms. The scale is theoretically grounded in Self-Determination

Theory and tailored speciﬁcally to the context of crowdsourced micro-labor.

The MCMS was validated on data collected in ten countries and three income

groups. Furthermore, measurement invariance tests showed that motivations

measured with the MCMS are comparable across countries and income groups.

This work constitutes a ﬁrst step towards understanding the motivations of the

international crowd workforce.

1. Introduction

During the past decade, crowd employment has emerged as a new form of

short term and ﬂexible employment. Crowd employment has been deﬁned as a

type of employment which “uses an online platform to enable organisations or

individuals to access an indeﬁnite and unknown group of other organisations or

individuals to solve speciﬁc problems or to provide speciﬁc services or products

in exchange for payment” [40]. While this deﬁnition is similar to the concept of

crowdsourcing [35], it explicitly includes only those activities that are performed

in exchange for payment.

One type of crowd employment platforms are micro-task platforms such as

Amazon Mechanical Turk1 (AMT) or CrowdFlower2. On micro-task platforms,

crowdworkers are payed on a per-task basis and a single task usually pays only

a few cents upon completion. The micro-tasks oﬀered to workers on these plat-

forms are also called “human intelligence tasks” and typically require workers to

solve problems that are easy to solve for humans, but hard to solve for comput-

ers. This characteristic led Amazon Mechanical Turk to coin the term “artiﬁcial

artiﬁcial intelligence” for describing this type of work. Typical micro-tasks in-

clude classiﬁcation and tagging of text or images, audio and image transcription,

and validating addresses of companies on the Web. Also more complex tasks

such as editing text documents [3], ontology alignment [53] and the evaluation

of unsupervised machine learning algorithms (e.g.

[6, 22, 47]) have been suc-

cessfully deployed on micro-task platforms. Anyone, regardless of geographical

location or education, can perform micro-tasks – the only necessary requirement

is having access to the Internet.

The emergence of crowd employment and a general trend towards more

ﬂexible and shorter term employment has given rise to policy discussions on

social protection and working conditions of crowdworkers (e.g. [46, 11, 10, 21]).

One ongoing discussion is whether crowd employment is to be considered “work”

2

at all, or whether it is mostly considered a spare-time activity by many workers,

meaning that payment plays only a minor role for them [46]. Currently, on

popular micro-task platforms, the achievable hourly wage is below 2 US$ (e.g.

[49, 32, 38]). While this amount is above minimum wage in some countries,

in many high-income countries it is far below the wage of any traditional job.

Despite this, the rise of crowd employment is an international phenomenon

which does not exclude high-income countries. Understanding the underlying

motivations of the “indeﬁnite and unknown group” of crowdworkers is therefore

crucial in understanding this new form of employment.

This paper develops the groundwork for understanding the motivations of

the international crowd workforce by presenting the Multidimensional Crowd-

worker Motivation Scale (MCMS). The MCMS is theoretically grounded in Self-

Determination Theory (SDT) and tailored speciﬁcally to the context of crowd-

sourced micro-labor. Most items in the MCMS are based on items from existing

SDT-based motivation scales (such as the Multidimensional Work Motivation

Scale [26] and the Work Extrinsic Intrinsic Motivation Scale [56]), which were

adapted to the idiosyncrasies of work on micro-task platforms.

The main contributions of this paper are (1) an evaluation of two existing

SDT-based work motivation scales with respect to their suitability for micro-

task crowdwork, (2) the development of the Multidimensional Crowdworker

Motivation Scale (MCMS), (3) a validation of the MCMS in ten countries and

three income groups, and (4) an evaluation of the cross-country and cross-group

comparability of motivations measured with the MCMS. To the best of our

knowledge, this is the ﬁrst SDT-based work motivation scale for the crowd-

working domain which is validated in multiple countries and groups.

This paper is structured in the following way: Section 2 gives a short

overview of the diﬀerent types of motivation as conceptualized by Self-Determi-

nation Theory and reviews existing SDT-based work motivation scales. Further-

more, it gives an overview of related work on the motivations of crowdworkers

on micro-task platforms.

In Section 3 we evaluate the suitability of existing

SDT-based work motivation scales for the crowdworking domain and show the

3

need for a work motivation scale adapted to the idiosyncrasies of this domain.

Section 4 describes the process of developing the MCMS and Section 5 presents

a validation of the MCMS in ten countries and three income groups. In Sec-

tion 6, we demonstrate the cross-country and cross-income group comparability

of motivations measured with the MCMS. Finally, Section 7 concludes this work

and discusses the scale’s limitations as well as directions for future research.

2. Related Work

Self-Determination Theory and Work Motivation.

Self-Determi-

nation Theory (SDT) was developed by Deci and Ryan [15, 16, 17]. The theory

speciﬁes three general kinds of motivation, amotivation, extrinsic motivation

and intrinsic motivation, which lie along a continuum of self-determination. At

the one extreme of the continuum lies amotivation which completely lacks self-

determination; at the other extreme lies intrinsic motivation which is completely

self-determined [24]. Between these extremes lies extrinsic motivation, which is

further split up into subtypes with varying degrees of internalisation: external

regulation, introjected regulation, identiﬁed regulation and integrated regulation.

While SDT hypothesizes that the diﬀerent types of motivation fall along a

continuum structure, empirical evidence for this continuum hypothesis is incon-

sistent (e.g.

[7, 34]). There is evidence that motivations diﬀer more in kind

than in degree and that SDT-based motivation scales are best represented by

multidimensional models [7]. Howard and Gagn´e [34] found evidence for a con-

tinuum structure, but they also highlight the importance of taking into account

the quality of motivation.

Figure 1 (adopted from [24]) shows the types of motivation as speciﬁed by

SDT. Amotivation is the absence of motivation, a state of acting passively or

not intending to act all. External regulation is the least self-determined form of

extrinsic motivation. Individuals motivated by external regulation act in order

to obtain rewards or avoid punishments [18]. Introjected regulation refers to a

form of partially internalized extrinsic motivation which aims at the avoidance

and Deci [24].

of guilt or at attaining feelings of worth [18]. Identiﬁed regulation is a form of

extrinsic motivation with a high degree of perceived autonomy, where the action

is in alignment with the individual’s personal goals. Integrated regulation is the

most self-determined form of extrinsic motivation and stems from evaluated

identiﬁcations that are in alignment with self-endorsed values, goals and needs

[18]. The most self-determined form of motivation is intrinsic motivation. This

form of motivation is non-instrumental and people act freely, driven by interest

and enjoyment inherent in the action [52].

Several work motivation scales have been developed based on SDT. The ﬁrst

SDT-based work motivation scale was a French scale developed by Blais et al.

[4]. Tremblay et al.

[56] translated this scale into English and conducted an

evaluation in diﬀerent work environments. The resulting Work Extrinsic and

Intrinsic Motivation Scale (WEIMS) measures six factors: amotivation, the four

external regulation subtypes and intrinsic motivation. Gagn´e et al. [25] created

the Motivation at Work Scale (MAWS), a scale which measures the four factors

external regulation, introjected regulation, identiﬁed regulation and intrinsic

motivation. The MAWS was validated in French and in English and was partly

based on [4].

Later, Gagn´e et al.

[26] developed the Multidimensional Work Motivation

Scale (MWMS). The MWMS was validated in seven languages and nine coun-

tries and does not include any items from the MAWS. MWMS measures six

5

ﬁrst-order factors (amotivation, material external regulation, social external

regulation, introjected regulation, identiﬁed regulation and intrinsic motivation)

and one second-order factor (external regulation).

Work motivation scales such as MWMS, MAWS and WEIMS investigate

motivations at the domain level of analysis, meaning that they measure the

general motivation to perform a job as opposed to speciﬁc tasks within a job.

Besides the domain of work, SDT-based scales for measuring motivation also

exist for many other domains such as sports [20, 44], teaching [19] or academics

[58].

Crowdworker Motivation on Micro-Task Platforms. Most research

investigating the motivations of workers on micro-task platforms has focused

on the platform Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT). Consequently, most studies

have focused on American and Indian crowdworkers, which constitute the vast

majority of workers on AMT [36, 49]. This country distribution is likely due to

the fact that workers can receive money from AMT in the USA and in India

while workers from other countries are paid in Amazon.com gift cards [57].

One early study on the reasons crowdworkers have for participating on AMT

was conducted by Ipeirotis [36]. He asked the multiple choice question “Why do

you complete tasks in Mechanical Turk?”, oﬀering six response possibilities. The

study found that more Indians than Americans treat AMT as a primary source

of income, and that few Indian workers report the reason “To kill time.” Hossain

[33] created a classiﬁcation of motivation in online platform participation, listing

extrinsic and intrinsic motivators and incentives.

Kaufmann et al. [37] developed an early model for measuring crowdworker

motivations on AMT, diﬀerentiating between enjoyment based motivation, com-

munity based motivation, immediate payoﬀs, delayed payoﬀs and social moti-

vation. They used a sample composed of Indian and US workers on AMT and

found that the construct with the highest score was “immediate payoﬀs,” i.e.

payment. Their study further found that the pastime score correlated positively

with household income and negatively with the weekly time spent on AMT, and

that workers who spend a lot of time on AMT may be motivated very diﬀerently

6

than workers who spend little time on the platform.

Antin and Shaw [1] used a list experiment for investigating social desirability

eﬀects in motivation self-reports of crowdworkers from the USA and India on

AMT. Using the four items “to kill time,” “to make extra money,” “for fun”

and ”because it gives me a sense of purpose,” they found that US workers tend

to over-report all four reasons while Indian workers tend to over-report “sense

of purpose” and under-report “killing time” and “fun.”

For measuring extrinsic motivations of crowdworkers, Naderi et al.

[42]

evaluated a 4-factor model using a subset of WEIMS items on a sample of US

workers on AMT. In this model, identiﬁed and integrated regulation are merged

into one factor, and the intrinsic motivation factor is omitted.

Several qualitative studies on the motivations of crowdworkers have been

conducted. For example, Gupta et al. [28, 29] investigated, among other aspects,

the motivations of Indian crowdworkers on AMT and Martin et al. [41] studied

the content of a forum for AMT users. Other research related to the motivations

of crowdworkers includes measuring the impact of motivation on performance

[48] and manipulating motivations via task framing [5] or achievement feedback

[39].

3. Suitability of Existing Work Motivation Scales

In order to determine whether existing SDT-based work motivation scales are

suitable for application in the crowdworking domain, we conduct an evaluation

of the WEIMS and the MWMS with crowdworkers on CrowdFlower. The reason

for choosing CrowdFlower over AMT is that we aim to develop a motivation scale

suitable for an international comparison of crowdworker motivations, instead

of exclusively focusing on crowdworkers in the USA and in India. We consider

CrowdFlower to be better suited for this task as it pays workers via independent

partner channels3 and therefore attracts a more international crowd-workforce.

In order for the scale stems and items to be conceptually applicable to the

crowdworking domain, minimal adaptations had to be performed. For WEIMS,

we changed the stem “Why do you do your work?” to “Why do you do Crowd-

Flower tasks?” and replaced the word “it” (referring to “your work”) in the

items with “CrowdFlower tasks.” The stem of MWMS “Why do you or would

you put eﬀorts into your current job?” was changed to “Why do you or would

you put eﬀorts into CrowdFlower tasks?” and words in the items referring to

“your current job” were replaced with “CrowdFlower tasks.” Additionally, one

item in the MWMS was conceptually not applicable to the domain and had to

be minimally adapted. There is no concept of “losing one’s job” on micro-task

platforms. The closest concept on CrowdFlower is failing many quality control

questions, which results in a lower worker account accuracy and consequently

in less tasks being oﬀered to the worker. Therefore, the item “Because I risk

losing my job if I don’t put enough eﬀort in it.” was changed to “Because I risk

not being oﬀered enough tasks if I don’t put enough eﬀort into them.”.

We choose to use the term “CrowdFlower tasks” in the stems and items

instead of a more general term because workers who are logged into CrowdFlower

via the partner channels see that they are doing “CrowdFlower tasks.” We can

therefore assume that workers know what CrowdFlower tasks are. In contrast,

general terms like “micro-tasks” or “human intelligence tasks” are widely used

in scientiﬁc publications and sometimes in the media but we cannot be sure that

workers on CrowdFlower understand this term as it does not appear frequently

on channel websites or on the platform itself.

For both of the minimally adapted work motivation scales, we collected 500

responses from crowdworkers residing in the USA. Anonymity was ensured.

After removing spammers (also see Section 5), the sample size was 424 for the

WEIMS and 414 for the MWMS. This constitutes a subject to item ratio higher

than 20:1 which is a suitable ratio for factor analysis [45, 23].

Conﬁrmatory Factor Analysis. We use conﬁrmatory factor analysis

(CFA) for evaluating the factor structure of the models. For all conﬁrmatory

factor analyses, we used the R packages lavaan [50] and semtools [54]. As the

8

item distributions were skewed, we used a robust maximum likelihood estimator

(as suggested in e.g. [14]). By specifying a robust maximum likelihood estima-

tor, the model parameters were estimated with robust standard errors and a

Satorra-Bentler (S-B) scaled test statistic is reported [50].

We evaluated the model ﬁt based on the absolute ﬁt measures root mean

squared error of approximation (RMSEA) and standardised root mean square

residual (SRMR) as well as the incremental ﬁt measures comparative ﬁt index

(CFI) and Tucker-Lewis index (TLI). For cut-oﬀ values of the goodness-of-ﬁt

measures, we followed the recommendations in Hooper et al. [30]: A well ﬁtting

model should have an RMSEA of less than 0.08, a SRMR of less than 0.05,

and ideally a CFI and TLI higher than 0.95 (but at least 0.9). Furthermore,

we report the (S-B scaled) Chi-Square test statistic but do not rely on it for

determining model ﬁt as it is very sensitive to sample size (e.g. [2]).

Models. We test the following models for the adapted WEIMS: (1) The

original WEIMS model with 6 factors (WEIMS-M1), (2) an alternative 5 factor

WEIMS model with the factors identiﬁed regulation and integrated regulation

loading onto a single factor (WEIMS-M2), and (3) the 4 factor, 12 item subset of

WEIMS items which was used by Naderi et al.

[42] to measure the extrinsic

motivations of workers on Amazon Mechanical Turk (WEIMS-M3). The rationale

for evaluating the alternative model WEIMS-M2 is that the integrated regulation

factor has been shown to be poorly separable from identiﬁed regulation and

intrinsic motivation (e.g. [56, 58]), which is also one of the reasons for why the

MWMS does not include an integrated regulation factor [26].

For the MWMS, we test the model originally hypothesized by Gagn´e et al.

[26] (MWMS-M1) and the model which had the best ﬁt in [26] (MWMS-M2). Further-

more, we test a 6 factor model where material external and social regulation

are separate factors, omitting the second-order external regulation factor. This

model is tested with a hypothesized correlation of zero between intrinsic motiva-

tion and both external regulation factors (MWMS-M3) and without the correlation

restriction (MWMS-M4).

Evaluation Results. None of the evaluated models, with the exception of

the 4-factor model WEIMS-M3, which does not measure intrinsic motivation, had

an acceptable model ﬁt on our data. Table 1 shows the goodness-of-ﬁt statistics

of the diﬀerent models.

The WEIMS model with 6 factors (WEIMS-M1) could not be estimated due to

the factors identiﬁed regulation and integrated regulation not being distinguish-

able from another, which resulted in the covariance matrix of the factors not

being positive deﬁnite. This is consistent with the ﬁndings of Naderi et al. [42].

Also for the alternative 5 factor model WEIMS-M2, the goodness-of-ﬁt measures

were not in the acceptable range.

The 4 factor model WEIMS-M3 was the only evaluated model with a good

ﬁt. However, besides the drawback that the model does not measure intrinsic

motivations, it has additional limitations: It includes one item for measuring the

amotivation construct which was criticized by Gagn´e et al. [26] for resembling

low satisfaction of the need for competence rather than measuring amotivation

(“I ask myself this question, I don’t seem to be able to manage the important

tasks related to this work.”). Furthermore, two of the four factors (external

regulation and introjected regulation) are measured by only two items each

and external regulation had a low reliability (Crohnbach’s alpha of 0.63) in

our evaluation. Note, however, that this evaluated subset of WEIMS is not

completely identical to the one used by Naderi et al.

[42] due to the small

adaptations made in item phrasing.

10

Of the evaluated MWMS models, the 6-factor model with separate factors for

social external and material external regulation and no correlation restrictions

had the best ﬁt. However, the ﬁt was not acceptable, with all goodness-of-ﬁt

measures being outside acceptable ranges. The ﬁt measures for MWMS-M2 are

not included in Table 1 due to the covariance matrix of the factors not being

positive deﬁnite.

Our results show that the evaluated work motivation scales developed for

the traditional work context do not work well within the crowdworking context

when only minimal adaptations in item phrasing are made. For the development

of a reliable motivation scale which measures the motivations of crowdworkers

on all dimensions, further adaptations are needed.

4. Development of the MCMS

The results of the conﬁrmatory factor analysis conducted on the slightly

modiﬁed WEIMS and MWMS show the necessity for developing a new scale

for measuring the motivations of crowdworkers that is adapted to the idiosyn-

cracies of the crowdwork environment. To meet this necessity, we developed

the Multidimensional Crowdworker Motivation Scale (MCMS) in three steps.

First, we compiled a pool of items conceptually suitable for the characteristics

of the crowdworking domain. Most of the items in the pool were adapted from

existing SDT-based motivation scales. Second, we selected items from the pool

based on exploratory factor analysis on a sample of workers residing in the USA.

Third, we further reduced the item pool based on exploratory factor analyses

on samples from Spanish4 and Indian crowdworkers.

For generating the item pool, we ﬁrst conducted exploratory factor analysis

on the data collected with WEIMS and MWMS in order to identify which

items of these scales should be included in the MCMS development item pool.

For all exploratory factor analyses, we use oblique rotation (promax), because

4In this paper, we use country demonyms synonymously with the location of workers for

better readability.

11

in line with SDT we expect the latent factors to be correlated. WEIMS and

MWMS items that had very low loadings on the appropriate factor as well as

items that had high crossloadings were not included in the pool. Furthermore,

we added only those items from WEIMS to the pool which were not deemed

problematic by MWMS, i.e. we excluded items that were culturally sensitive

or that addressed needs rather than motivations. We included all items from

the MWMS which were conceptually suitable for the crowdworking domain.

The minimal adaptions to the crowdworking domain described in the previous

section were kept.

To extend the pool, we added semantically suitable items from the motiva-

tion scales developed in [20] and [19] as well as several new items. The total

number of items in the pool was 44. The stem phrasing “Why do you or would

you put eﬀorts into doing CrowdFlower tasks?” adapted from MWMS was used

in order to capture both actual and latent motivations.

For a ﬁrst selection of items from the pool, we collected answers from 1,000

crowdworkers residing in the USA. Exploratory factor analysis was conducted

on the responses. Consistent with the ﬁndings from Section 3, we found that

material external regulation and social external regulation did not load on the

same factor. Therefore, we aimed at a 6-factor model with the two separate

external regulation factors (social and material).

Items which had very low

factor loadings on the appropriate factor (< 0.5), items which loaded on a

factor diﬀerent to the one theorized as well as items with high cross-loadings

(> 0.35) were iteratively removed from the initial pool, creating a reduced item

pool with 36 items.

We conducted a second round of data collection with this reduced item pool,

collecting responses from 1,000 Spanish and 1,200 Indian crowdworkers. The

additional 200 responses from the Indian crowdworkers were requested due to

the high amount of spam in this response set (also see Section 5), with the aim

of achieving an item-to-response ratio of close to 1:20. Again, we iteratively

removed items with low loadings (with the higher threshold of < 0.7 if more

than three items were left for this construct), wrong loadings, or high cross-

12

loadings (with the threshold of > 0.3). Furthermore, if two items were phrased

very similarly and the factor had more than three items remaining, we removed

the item with the lower loading.

The ﬁnal MCMS contains 18 items, with three items loading on each factor.

Of the 18 ﬁnal items, ﬁve were adapted from [26], four from [56], two from [19]

and [44] each, and ﬁve items are new (but semantically based on items from

existing scales). Like other SDT-based work motivation scales, the MCMS aims

to measure motivations at the domain level of analysis (i.e. the job) as opposed

to speciﬁc tasks within a job. Table A.10 shows the scale.

5. Validation of the MCMS

Data Collection. With the ﬁnal version of the MCMS, we collected data

from 10 countries, with 900 participants from each country for validation. We

selected countries from three World Bank income groups5: high income, upper

middle income and lower middle income. From each of the three income groups,

we selected three countries with high activity on CrowdFlower. The countries

were selected according to the following criteria: The country had to be active on

CrowdFlower (either high in the Alexa6 ranking or one of the top contributing

countries in at least one of the partner channels) and we aimed for a high cultural

diversity overall as well as within the income groups. For the high income group,

the selected countries were USA, Germany and Spain. The upper middle income

group contains Brazil, Russia and Mexico, and the lower middle income group

is comprised of India, Indonesia and the Philippines. Note that in the rest of

this paper, we use the group label “Middle Income” (MID) for the upper middle

income group and “Low Income” (LOW) for the lower middle income group for

better readability.

In addition, we collected responses from Venezuela as it was the most ac-

tive country on CrowdFlower at the time of data collection, with CrowdFlower

5http://databank.worldbank.org/data/download/site-content/CLASS.xls
6http://www.alexa.com/

13

receiving 18.5% of traﬃc from this country7. However, we did not include

Venezuela in the data grouped by income as we believe it represents a special

case: At the time of data collection the US$ earned on CrowdFlower could be

sold on the black market at a rate several orders of magnitude higher than the

oﬃcial exchange rate [43].

In order to capture a diverse sample of crowdworkers in each country, the

starting times of the survey were divided into three groups: (1) 300 responses

were requested during typical working hours (8:00 am to 5:00 pm in the ap-

propriate time zone), (2) 300 responses were requested in the evening (6:00 pm

to 11:pm in the appropriate time zone) and ﬁnally, (3) 300 responses were re-

quested during weekends. The data was collected in October and November

2016.

The items in the MCMS were randomly permuted and presented to crowd-

workers as a task on CrowdFlower. Besides the MCMS items, the task also

included a section with demographic questions and questions about money use,

as well as a section where workers were instructed to think of ﬁve reasons for

why they do tasks on CrowdFlower and asked to write down these reasons.

Anonymity was ensured.

Spam Detection. We expected a signiﬁcant amount of spam in the re-

sponses, such as people not reading the questions and clicking randomly or

workers accepting the task despite having insuﬃcient English skills. To coun-

teract a high amount of noise in the dataset, we included three test items in

the motivation scale section of the CrowdFlower task, and an additional test

question in the demographics section.

The test items in the motivation scale section of the task asked participants

to answer with a speciﬁc ranking on the Likert scale and the test question in

the demographics section consisted of the question “Are you paying attention

to the questions?” with the possible answers “No,” “Yes” and “I don’t know”

selectable from a drop-down list. These questions ensure that less than 0.1%

Hypothesized Model. Due to the results of the evaluation of existing

scales and the results from exploratory factor analysis on the MCMS item pool,

we model material external and social external regulation as two separate fac-

tors. Hence, our hypothesized model is a 6-factor model where all factors are

ﬁrst-order factors. Note that the material and social external regulation are not

adjacent factors in the continuum hypothesized by SDT but occupy the same

spot.

While SDT hypothesizes that intrinsic motivation does not correlate with

external regulation [26, 51], Chemolli and Gagn´e [7] found that intrinsic mo-

tivation correlates with external regulation signiﬁcantly for both the MWMS

to restrict these correlations to zero in our hypothesized model, but we evalu-

ate the model ﬁt of both the correlation-restricted and the unrestricted model.

No cross-loadings were hypothesized. The hypothesized model is depicted in

Descriptive Statistics and Internal Consistency. Table 3 summarizes

the empirical factor means as well as standard deviations for each of the coun-

tries and income groups in our data. Table 4 displays the Pearson correlations of

the empirical factor means. The observed correlations do not strictly follow the

16

continuum hypothesized by SDT (i.e. adjacent factors correlate stronger than

nonadjacent factors). However, we do observe a negative correlation between

intrinsic motivation and amotivation, and the strongest correlations are between

adjacent factors (intrinsic motivation with identiﬁed regulation and introjected

regulation with social external regulation).

Cronbach’s alpha statistic [12] was used to assess the internal consistency of

the MCMS. Table 5 displays the values of alpha for each country and income

group. As a rule of thumb, values above 0.7 are considered acceptable, values

between 0.6 and 0.7 questionable, values between 0.5 and 0.6 poor and values

below 0.5 unacceptable [27]. In most countries and groups, alpha exceeds 0.7

for each construct. Exceptions to this are the amotivation factor in Brazil

and Venezuela as well as the material external regulation factor in Brazil and

Indonesia with values between 0.5 and 0.7. Therefore, when interpreting results

from these factors and groups, care should be taken.

of this item is ﬁxed to one).

Table 6 shows the results of the conﬁrmatory factor analysis of the hypoth-

esized model. The analysis was conducted on the entire dataset as well as on

each group separately. As in Section 3, we follow the guidelines of Hooper et

al. [30] for evaluating model ﬁt. The results show that the hypothesized model

has adequate ﬁt overall as well as in all groups. The CFI was above 0.95 in

all groups except Indonesia and Mexico (with 0.931 and 0.948, respectively).

RMSEA was lower than 0.06 in all groups and SRMR was lower than or equal

to 0.05 in all groups. We consider the ﬁt measures for Mexico and Indonesia to

be borderline acceptable, but some care should be taken when interpreting the

results from these countries.

estimated factor correlations are statistically signiﬁcant at p < 0.01 (most at

p < 0.001).

The alternative model which restricts the correlations of the external regu-

lation factors (material external regulation and social external regulation) with

intrinsic motivation to zero did not have an acceptable ﬁt: While CFI was close

to 0.95 for most groups (0.948 for the total sample), SRMR was high for the

total sample (0.094) as well as for all other groups, ranging between 0.074 in

the USA and 0.113 in Russia.

groups, a key is to ensure that the instrument possesses the same psychomet-

ric properties in all groups. This characteristic is referred to as measurement

invariance. Tests of measurement invariance evaluate “whether or not, under

diﬀerent conditions of observing and studying phenomena, measurement op-

erations yield measures of the same attribute” [31]. In our case, measurement

invariance means that crowdworkers from diﬀerent countries (or country income

groups) assign the same meaning to the items used in the MCMS.

For evaluating measurement invariance of the MCMS, we conduct Multi-

group Conﬁrmatory Factor Analysis (MGCFA). In MGCFA, measurement in-

variance is evaluated via a series of hypothesis tests which test invariance at dif-

ferent levels. Three levels of measurement invariance are required for comparing

latent mean diﬀerences across groups: conﬁgural, metric and scalar invariance

(e.g. [9, 8]). Conﬁgural invariance requires that the items share the same conﬁg-

urations of loadings in all groups. Metric invariance requires that the loadings

of each item on its factor is the same across groups. Scalar invariance requires

that the intercepts of item regressions on the factor are the same across groups.

We calculate conﬁgural, metric and scalar invariance of the MCMS for coun-

tries and income groups. Table 9 displays the results of the MGCFA. Conﬁgural

Table 9: Measurement invariance. This table shows the results of the MGCFA tests of

invariance between groups and countries. The deltas are with respect to the previous level

of measurement invariance, i.e.

scalar invariance should be below 0.01 for CFI and below 0.015 for RMSEA. * 1 free intercept

invariance is indicated by acceptable goodness-of-ﬁt indices in an MGCFA model

without any equality constraints [59]. For indications of metric and scalar non-

invariance, we follow the guidelines of Chen [8]: For metric and scalar invariance
in large samples (N > 300), a change of ≥ −0.010 in CFI supplemented by a
change of ≥ 0.015 in RMSEA indicates non-invariance.

Table 9 shows the goodness-of-ﬁt indices for the progressively restricted mod-

els. The results show a good ﬁt for the model without equality constraints,

indicating that conﬁgural invariance is supported. Full metric invariance was

also achieved, indicating that the strength of the relationship between the items

and constructs is the same across groups. Full scalar invariance could not be

achieved. However, partial scalar invariance was achieved by releasing one in-

tercept for the income groups (Am3 ) and ﬁve intercepts in the countries (Am3,

ExMat2, ExSoc3, Introj2 and Ident2 ). Achieving partial scalar invariance al-

lows for factor means to be compared. However, Steinmetz’ [55] simulations

showed that unequal intercepts may lead to wrong conclusions when comparing

observed composite means across groups. Therefore, as only partial and not

full scalar invariance was achieved for the MCMS, a comparison of the scale’s

latent factor means should rely on the model-implied means instead of observed

composite means.

7. Conclusion

In this paper, we presented the Multidimensional Crowdworker Motivation

Scale (MCMS), a new scale for measuring crowdworker motivations. The scale

measures the motivations of crowdworkers on six dimensions, based on the con-

ceptualization of motivation suggested by Self-Determination Theory (SDT).

To the best of our knowledge, the MCMS is the ﬁrst instrument for measuring

motivation in the context of crowdsourced micro-labor which is validated in mul-

tiple countries and income groups. Furthermore, the results of the measurement

invariance analyses show that motivations measured with the MCMS are com-

parable across countries and income groups. This work constitutes a ﬁrst step

22

towards understanding the motivations of crowdworkers in an internationally

comparable way.

The work presented in this paper has several limitations. First of all, the

scale was presented in English to the crowdworkers in all countries, which means

that we are only able to capture the motivations of crowdworkers with appro-

priate English skills.

Regarding the presence of social desirability bias, Blais et al. [4] found that

self-reported work motivations only correlated very weakly with the Marlow-

Crowne Social Desirability Scale [13] (correlations between -0.18 and 0.20).

However, as Antin and Shaw [1] found evidence for the presence of social desir-

ability bias in self-reported motivations of crowdworkers, further experiments

are needed in order to assess the extent to which social desirability bias is present

in data collected with the MCMS.

A further limitation of the MCMS is that it does not measure integrated

regulation. The lack of an integrated regulation factor in the MCMS is due to

problems of statistically distinguishing this factor from identiﬁed regulation and

intrinsic motivation. Due to the same problems, this limitation is also present

in other work motivation scales such as the MWMS [26].

Another limitation of this work is that the extent to which motivations mea-

sured with the MCMS are related to diﬀerent antecedents and outcomes has

not been assessed yet. For investigating the relations between measured moti-

vations and antecedents (e.g. the satisfaction of basic needs) or outcomes (e.g.

emotional exhaustion), the scales for measuring the antecedents and outcomes

would ﬁrst have to be validated within the crowdworking domain.

In future work, we plan to conduct a cross-country as well as a cross-income

group comparison of crowdworker motivations using the model-implied means.

Furthermore, we plan to investigate the relationship between motivations and

other demographic factors. Another direction which we plan to follow in future

work is the development of Bayesian models which incorporate not only the

responses to the MCMS items but also responses to open-ended survey ques-

tions and demographic metadata. This work is relevant for researchers and

23

practitioners interested in measuring the motivations of crowdworkers.

Appendix A. The Multidimensional Crowdworker Motivation Scale

Table A.10: The Multidimensional Crowdworker Motivation Scale. The stem is “Why

do you or would you put eﬀorts into doing CrowdFlower tasks?”. All items were answered on

a 7-point Likert scale ranging from “not at all” (1) to “completely” (7). The column “Source”

indicates from which motivation scale the item was adapted.

Amotivation

Am1

Am2

Am3

I don’t know why, CrowdFlower tasks often seem like a waste of time.

I don’t know why I’m doing CrowdFlower tasks, it’s pointless work.

I don’t know why, I often perceive CrowdFlower tasks as an annoying chore.

External Regulation (Material)

ExMat1 Because CrowdFlower tasks give me ﬁnancial gains.

ExMat2

For the income CrowdFlower tasks provide me.

ExMat3 Because of the money I get from doing CrowdFlower tasks.

External Regulation (Social)

ExSoc1

Because other people want me to do CrowdFlower tasks (e.g. family, friends,...).

ExSoc2

Because other people say I should (e.g. family, friends,...).

ExSoc3

Because other people expect it of me (e.g. family, friends,...).

Introjected Regulation

Introj1

Because otherwise I would have a bad conscience.

Introj2

Because otherwise I will feel ashamed of myself.

Introj3

Because otherwise I will feel bad about myself.

Identiﬁed Regulation

Ident1

Because this is the type of work I chose to do to attain a certain lifestyle.

Ident2

Because I chose this type of work to attain my career goals.

Ident3

Because it is the type of work I have chosen to attain certain important objectives.

Intrinsic Motivation

Intrin1

Because I have fun doing CrowdFlower tasks.

Intrin2

Because I enjoy doing CrowdFlower tasks.

Intrin3

Because what I do in CrowdFlower tasks is interesting.
