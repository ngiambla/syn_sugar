Abstract

How the online social media, like Twitter or its variant Weibo, interacts with the stock market

and whether it can be a convincing proxy to predict the stock market have been debated for years,

especially for China. As the traditional theory in behavioral ﬁnance states, the individual emotions

can inﬂuence decision-makings of investors, it is reasonable to further explore these controversial

topics systematically from the perspective of online emotions, which are richly carried by massive

tweets in social media. Through thorough studies on over 10 million stock-relevant tweets and

3 million investors from Weibo, it is revealed that inexperienced investors with high emotional

volatility are more sensible to the market ﬂuctuations than the experienced or institutional ones,

and their dominant occupation also indicates that the Chinese market might be more emotional as

compared to its western counterparts. Then both correlation analysis and causality test demon-

strate that ﬁve attributes of the stock market in China can be competently predicted by various

online emotions, like disgust, joy, sadness and fear. Speciﬁcally, the presented prediction model

signiﬁcantly outperforms the baseline model, including the one taking purely ﬁnancial time series

as input features, on predicting ﬁve attributes of the stock market under the K-means discretiza-

tion. We also employ this prediction model in the scenario of realistic online application and its

performance is further testiﬁed.

INTRODUCTION

There are a large number of tweets in popular platforms like Twitter and Weibo with

explosive development of online social media. These tweets, spreading in terms of word-of-

mouth, not only convey the authentic information, but also reﬂect the emotional status of

the authors. For example, the development report from Weibo in 2015 oﬃcially shows the

number of monthly active users is around 222 million. Around 100 million Chinese tweets

are posted in Weibo every day and from which we cannot only sense what happens in China,

but also how millions of users feel about their lives. The online social media indeed provide

us an unprecedented opportunity to study the detailed human behavior from many new

views.

Investment decision and arbitrage model in the stock market attract much attention in

recent decade. However, there is much controversy as to whether online social media like

Twitter can be excellent predictors, especially for the stock market in China [5, 26, 37]. Dif-

ferent from western markets, the governmental intervention on the marketing regulations in

China will introduce more non-market factors that might disturb the ﬂuctuation of the stock

market. Moreover, those possible interventions could be leaked through the social media and

then greatly inﬂuence the investors’ emotions and decisions. In the meantime, considering

the irrationality of huge amount of individual yet inexperienced investors in China (which is

also rare in the west), their actions might be more easily aﬀected by online news and other

investors’ feelings about the market. Then the messages about the stock market and the

sentiments they convey could be promising indicators for the market prediction. Therefore,

like the conventional behavioral ﬁnance theory claims, which the emotion can inﬂuence the

decision-process of the investors, it is necessary to investigate the following important issues:
• How do diﬀerent investors response emotionally to the performance of the stock market

in China?

• Is there indeed signiﬁcant correlation between online emotions and attributes of the

Chinese stock market?

• Can online emotions predict the attributes of the stock market in China?
• Which emotion does play the role in predicting various attributes of the Chinese stock

market?

2

In this study, we collect over ten million Chinese stock-relevant tweets from Weibo and

classify them into ﬁve emotions, including anger, disgust, joy, sadness and fear. We discuss

the emotional volatility of investors who belong to diﬀerent categories classiﬁed by the

number of followers and the gender.

It’s interesting to ﬁnd that after a steep decline of

the index, a short-term rising of market can help ordinary investors build the conﬁdence

quickly. However, the professional individual investors and institutional investors stay in

fear and aﬃrm it is the bear market. The volatility of online emotions of the experienced

or institutional investors is far less than the ordinary inexperienced investors. In addition,

female investors seem to possess higher emotional volatility than the male, suggesting their

sensitiveness to the market ﬂuctuation. Besides the daily closing index of Shanghai Stock

Exchange (In the present paper, index refers in particular to Shanghai Stock Exchange

Composite Index and the trading volume refers in particular to the daily volume of the

Shanghai Stock Exchange), we consider the daily opening index, the intra-day highest index,

the intra-day lowest index and the daily trading volume of the stock market. By both

correlation analysis and Granger causality test, it is revealed that disgust has a Granger

causal relation with the closing index, joy, fear and disgust have Granger causal relations

with the opening index, joy, sadness and disgust have Granger causal relations with the

intra-day highest and lowest index, and correlation between trading volume and sadness is

unexpectedly strong. It’s also surprising to ﬁnd that anger in online social media possesses

the weakest correlation or even is no relation with the Chinese stock market, except for the

experienced users (less than 2% of the total investors yet less emotional as compared to

others), for whom anger demonstrates a slightly signiﬁcant connection of Granger causality

with the market.

According to these ﬁndings, we establish classiﬁcation-oriented predictors, in which dif-

ferent emotions are selected as features, to predict ﬁve daily attributes of the stock market

in China. The comparison with other baseline methods, including the one taking purely

ﬁnancial time series as input features shows that our model can outperform them according

to K-means discretization. And the model is also deployed in a realistic application and

achieves the accuracy of 64.15% for the intra-day highest index (3-categories) and the ac-

curacy of 60.38% for the trading volume (3-categories). Our explorations demonstrate that

the online emotions, especially disgust, joy, sadness and fear, in Weibo indeed can predict

the stock market in China.

II. RELATED WORKS

Behavioral ﬁnance has provided solid proof that ﬁnancial decisions are signiﬁcantly driven

by emotion and mood [11, 27]. Nevertheless, because of the lacking of eﬀective measurement

method of emotions, stock prediction using emotions has been in dispute [4, 7]. Traditionally,

the general moods of investors are measured by surveys, e.g., Daily Investor Sentiment [1]

and Investor Intelligence [2]. As psychological evidence demonstrated that weather was

associated with mood, weather was known as the proxy to examine the relation between

emotion and stock market [18, 19]. However, with the recent widespread presence of per-

sonal computers and Internet, public emotions can be extracted easily from data on online

platforms. Using Twitter as a corpus, researchers built sentiment classiﬁers, which are able

to determine diﬀerent sentiments for tweets [15, 30, 31]. Especially on Sina Weibo platform,

Zhao et al. trained a fast Naive Bayes classiﬁer for Chinese emotion classiﬁcation, which is

now available online for temporal and spatial sentiment pattern discovery [42]. These works

indeed provide foundations for considering public emotions as input for stock predictions.

There have long been discussed on the predictive power of social media aiming at diﬀerent

ﬁelds [14, 34]. In the ﬁeld of ﬁnance, Bollen et al. found that public mood on Twitter can

predict the Dow Jones Industrial Average[5]. Meanwhile, the public mood dimensions of

Calm and Happiness seemed to have a predictive eﬀect. However, the tweets they collected

were associated with whole social status, not just the stock market in America, which could

not well represent online investors’ sentiment. Oh et al. also showed stock micro-blog

sentiments did have predictive power for market returns [29]. Instead of emotion on social

media, some researchers examined textual representations in ﬁnancial news articles for stock

prediction [9, 35]. Antweiler and Frank found the messages posted on Yahoo! Finance and

Raging Bull help predict market volatility, however the eﬀect on stock returns is economically

small [1]. Ding et al. proposed a deep learning method for event-driven stock market

prediction on large-scale ﬁnancial news dataset [24, 39]. Besides, Bordino et al. showed that

daily trading volumes of stocks traded in NASDAQ100 were correlated with daily volumes

of queries related to the same stocks [6], as well as the volumes of queries at the weekly

level [33].

In comparison to this extensive literature, much less research focused on the relationships

between the Chinese stock market and online emotions in social media. Mao et al. pointed

4

out that Twitter did not have a predictive eﬀect with respect to predicting developments

in Chinese stock markets [26]. They advised adopting the tweets on Weibo platform to

research Chinese stock market. Based on 66,317 tweets of Weibo with one year and two

emotion categories, Cheng and Lin found that the investors’ bullish sentiment of social

media can help to predict trading volume of the stock market, but still did not work for the

market returns [37]. Because of less collected data set and simple emotion classiﬁcation, it

is not easy to generalize their conclusions to other realistic scenarios.

In light of these studies, we focus purely on the stock market in China and try to under-

stand the volatility, causality and predictive ability of multiple online emotions in Weibo.

Diﬀerent from the previous studies, we attempt to develop predictors from more data sets

and more sentiments and to predict more attributes of the real market.

This paper is an extended version of [43]. The supplementary content to [43] is stated

as follows. From the perspective of online emotions, we investigate how investors respond

online to the stock market. Investors are divided into multiple categories according to the

number of followers and gender in Weibo. We deﬁne the ratio of joy to fear (RJF ) to reﬂect

the overall psychological state of diﬀerent investors while trading in greed and fear. The

deviation of RJF can be further used to model the emotional volatility of investors. It is

the ﬁrst to reveal that inexperienced investors are more sensible to the market ﬂuctuations

than the experienced or institutional ones from the perspective of social media, suggesting

the Chinese market is emotional. In realistic application, we evaluate the performance of

models based on online emotions extracted from diﬀerent categories of users. We also build

the baseline models based on market return to examine the robustness of online emotions’

predictive power.

III. DATA SETS

In this section, the data sets will be depicted. We obtain over 10 million public stock-

relevant tweets on Weibo through its open APIs over one year from December 1st 2014 to

December 7th 2015. Employing the Bayesian classiﬁer of emotions and other preprocessing

methods, we obtain time series which could reﬂect the online emotion of daily stock market

in the period. The stock market data referring to the index and trading volumes is crawled

and processing in the same period.

Figure 1: Volume of the stock-relevant tweets from September 1st to 16th in 2015. There

are respectively Memorial Day between 9-3 and 9-5 and a weekend between 9-12 and 9-13,

which are also non-trading days.

A. Online stock market emotions

The Emotions of investors can be obtained through many diﬀerent approaches, like ques-

tionnaires in previous study. With the explosive development of the social media in China,

more and more investors express their feelings on Weibo. Therefore, we choose and utilize

the characteristic of Weibo to collect the online emotion referring to Chinese stock market.

From December 1st 2014 to December 7th 2015, the massive public tweets on Weibo

are collected through its open APIs. However, only a fraction of the tweets is semantically

related with Chinese stock market. Filtering out the irrelevant tweets and remaining the

data that truly represents the stock market emotion is a very signiﬁcant step. Therefore,

we manually select six Chinese keywords, including Stock, Stock Market, Security, The

Shenzhen Composite Index, The Shanghai Composite Index and Component Index with

help of expertise from the background of ﬁnance. These manually selected keywords are

supposed to depict the overall status of Chinese stock market suﬃciently. We postulate that

if the text of tweet contains one or more of the six selected keywords, the tweet describes

the news, opinions or sentiments about Chinese stock market. In our database, the number

of tweets related to stock market, involving one or more keywords, is a total of 10,550,525

from December 1st 2014 to December 7th 2015.

It is widely accepted that there are six basic emotions for human, including joy, surprise,

cation [42], emoticons are mapped manually by several experts into these six sentiments,

serving as the class labels of tweets. However, the emotion ‘surprise’ is absent from Weibo

and there is no suﬃcient convincing emoticon corresponding to it. Therefore, we choose

the other ﬁve types of online emotions to represent the emotional expression in Weibo and

investigate their connections with the stock market of China. In total we collect over 3.5

million emotionally labeled tweets as the corpus and train a fast Naive Bayes classiﬁer, with

an empirical precision of 64.3% to automatically categorize a tweet without emoticon into

a certain emotion. We arrange the stock-relevant tweets with one day as the time unit and

employ the sentiment classiﬁer to label them with the emotions. There are ﬁve online emo-

tion time series: Xanger, Xdisgust, Xjoy, Xsadness and Xf ear. Online emotions are represented

by X = (Xanger, Xdisgust, Xjoy, Xsadness, Xf ear).

We ﬁnd the volume of tweets reduces signiﬁcantly on non-trading days. Fig. 1 shows

the volume of the tweets related to the stock market from September 1st to 16th in 2015.

There are separately Memorial Day between September 3rd and 5th and a weekend between

September 12th and 13th, which are both non-trading days. We consider that online stock

market emotion on non-trading days could not help us analyze and predict Chinese stock

market. Hence, removing the data items on non-trading days from the time series, the

results retain signiﬁcant emotion data. It also partly reﬂects that tweets selected by the

keywords could well represent ﬂuctuations of the stock market.

For the sake of stability of online emotion data, we measure the relative value (proportion)

of each mood on one day as the ﬁnal online stock market emotion X. Fig. 2 shows online

stock market emotion time series X from September 1st to 16th in 2015. We observe the

spike in Xanger on May 12th in 2015, when there is a heated argument between CEOs of

listed companies. On June 19th, 2015, there was a plunge in Chinese stock market, with a

fall of the index with 6.41% and Xsadness arrived the maximum. Since June 2015, persistent

falling of the index caused inward fears of investors, which can be seen from the sharp growth

of Xf ear in Fig. 2.

From the above observations, it can be concluded that the ﬂuctuation of the sentiments

can be connected with remarkable events in the stock market.

It further inspires us to

investigate the correlation and even causality between emotions and the market, which will

provide the foundation for the predicting models.

September 16th 2015.

B. Stock market data

The economists and traders consider the Shanghai Stock Exchange Composite Index

as reﬂecting the overall status of the Chinese stock market. Therefore, the index (shown

in Fig. 3) is selected as price attribute of the stock market to analyze and predict.

In

particular, there are four values in candlestick charts of the index, which are respectively

the closing index, the opening index, the intra-day highest index, the intra-day lowest index.

We transform the values of the index into Close, Open, High and Low (to express rate of

change on i-th day), and they can be written as

Closei =

Openi =

Highi =

Lowi =

Indexclose,i−1

Indexclose,i − Indexclose,i−1
Indexopen,i − Indexclose,i−1
Indexhigh,i − Indexclose,i−1
Indexlow,i − Indexclose,i−1

In addition to these four attributes, the trading volume of Shanghai Stock Exchange is

also a key target used to reﬂect the status of the Chinese stock market. The time series of

trading volume on each day is not transformed at all.

We crawl historical data of the index and trading volume from December 1st 2014 to

December 7th 2015. In this period, the number of trading days is totally 249 in our research.

As a result, we obtain ﬁve time series which depict stock market’s state on each day including

Yclose, Yopen, Yhigh, Ylow and Yvolume. Each time series is a column vector of Y (shown in

Fig. 10), i.e., Y = (Yclose, Yopen, Yhigh, Ylow, Yvolume).

The dataset (X and Y ) is divided into two parts according to the date: the 80% data

for training (from December 1st 2014 to September 16th 2015) and the 20% data for testing

(from September 17th to December 7th in 2015). The training set is used to not only

analyze the relation between online emotions and the stock market but also ﬁt and estimate

the prediction model. The testing set is kept in a vault and brought out only at the end of

evaluation in realistic application.

IV. VOLATILITY OF ONLINE EMOTIONS FROM DIFFERENT INVESTORS

To explore the connection between emotion and stock, the ﬁrst intuition is to understand

how investors respond online to the market from the perspective of emotions. Hence in

this section, we divide the investors into multiple categories according to the number of

followers and gender in Weibo. Note that the followers and gender information of the

users can be extracted from the pubic proﬁles returned by Weibo’s open APIs. Then the

ratio of joy to fear (RJF ) is deﬁned to reﬂect the averaged psychological state of diﬀerent

emotional volatility of investors. The comparison of emotional volatility of diﬀerent investors

demonstrate that professional or institutional investors are more emotionally stable than

ordinary investors as the stock index rises or declines. More interestingly, female investors

might be more sensible to the market performance as compared to the male.

A.

Investor categorizations

Massive individual or institutional investors express their reﬂections to the market perfor-

mance through emotional tweets in Weibo. Though it is diﬃcult to determine the investment

level or type of Weibo users from their online proﬁles and stock-related tweets, the number

of followers in Weibo is indeed a convincing indicator to measure users’ inﬂuence to their

online community [8, 25, 41]. Generally, users with higher numbers of followers will be

more likely to be inﬂuenced by altruistic messages and calls to help others and oﬀers to join

discussion groups and opinion forums. Referring to investment and exchange in the stock

market, it appears that the investors who join Weibo to actively participate in discussions

with inspiring traders and provide help and information to the community, can oﬀer poten-

tial values to other participants and thus enjoy higher popularity in Weibo. For example, the

stock market experts or successful investors are always followed by plenty of other investors

in Weibo because of their expertise and experience in market analysis and sometimes they

even recommend certain strategies on the targeted stocks to followers. In fact, Weibo also

provides a feature of bonus that followers who eventually proﬁt from online suggestions or

recommendations can voluntarily reward those experts. This feature greatly encourages the

stock information sharing online and the inﬂuential investors with more experience will gain

more attention, like followers in Weibo. Note that here the investors mentioned is ﬁltered

out from the Weibo users if posting stock-related tweets and we assume that investors of

real-world can be evenly sampled through this way, especially considering the vast number

of Weibo users.

Inspired by the above observations, in this study we divide the investors into three cat-

egories according to their numbers of followers in Weibo, including F-level I, II and III as

shown in Fig. 4 (1.8 million F-level I users, 1.5 million F-level II users and 5.5 thousand

F-level III users). Speciﬁcally, the number of followers in F-level I users is less than 102

10

(around the Dunbar’s number [12] and possible for any user) and they occupy the bottom

53.5% of the investors we ﬁlter out in Weibo. The number of followers in F-level II users

ranges between 102 and 104 (a large volume and infeasible for most of users [16]) and they

occupy the medium 45%. We consider that most of F-level I and F-level II users are inexpe-

rienced ordinary investors. The left users with more than 104 followers belong to the F-level

III and they only occupy 1.5%. In fact, most of users in F-level III are either sophisticated

and professional individual investors in stock investment or the online agents of institutional

investors.

It is found that emotion expression is demographics dependent [3, 20] and thus gender

matters in investigating the emotional volatility of investors. In the meantime, because of

the common fact that decision-makings can be aﬀected by demographics like gender, we

further divide investors in Weibo into categories of female (1.4 million) and male (2 million)

based on user proﬁles, oﬀering more perspectives in understanding investors’ online emotion

expression.

In section III A, we deﬁne the online stock market emotions X without considering the

category of users. Adopting the same method, we obtain three or two groups of X based

on F-level or gender categories. Focusing on the centralized tendency of X in categories,

we calculate the moving average value of X, in which the sliding window size is ﬁxed to

20 (days). Fig. 5 exhibits the time series (moving average X) rolling with a window of

20 days of each online stock market emotion for F-level categories. We ﬁnd that F-level I

investors’ emotions vary more obviously than that of other two categories, especially for Xjoy

and Xf ear. Surprisingly, to the F-level III users that composed mainly by experienced or

institutional investors, Xf ear takes the dominant proportion after May 28th, 2015, indicating

their aﬃrmation of bearish after the steep decline of Chinese market.

B. Trading in greed and fear

Greed and fear are two intrinsic psychological states relating to ﬂuctuation of stock mar-

ket. And thus in general, the trading activity of the agents can be psychologically char-

acterized by greed and fear. In speciﬁc, with respect to greed, the investors optimistically

believe in rising markets and thus buy stocks; while regarding to fear, if stock prices ﬂuctu-

ate too abruptly, they panic and sell stocks. In addition, the agents switch between these

11

Figure 4: Distribution of the number of followers (denoted as nf ) across all Weibo users.

We highlight in blue the bottom 53.5% of the area, corresponding to users with low

number of followers (nf <= 102) in F-level I category. Red bars indicate users with high
number of followers (top 1.5%, nf >= 104) in F-level III category while yellow corresponds

to the remaining 45% users with medium number of followers (102 <= nf <= 104) in

F-level II category.

two psychological states and thus demonstrate a pattern of trading in greed and fear. It has

also been revealed that as historical volatility of the market is low, investors are rather calm

and vice versa [38]. One of the best available and accepted tools to measure stock market

volatility is CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), elaborated by Chicago Board Options Exchange

in 1993. In other words, VIX can be deﬁned as a sentiment ratio of Wall Street’s greed to

fear [28]. It is usually used by traders to check the degree of investor complacency or market

fear. However, we argue that online emotions can be used directly and accurately to measure

the sentiment ratio of greed to fear, instead of the volatility of market indirectly and vaguely.

Because in the circumstance of bullish market, investors intend to post positive tweets with

joyful sentiment and thus joy can be an ideal proxy of the external emotional expression of

greed and complacency for investors. Then based on online emotions of investors, we deﬁne

the ratio of joy (greed) to fear (RJF ) at t moment as

RJFt =

Xjoy,t
Xf ear,t

,

(2)

which is a new and purely emotion-based index to describe the psychological state of investors

in Chinese stock market. While RJFt is greater than 1, the investors consider the market

is rising and are pleased to put more money into it. However, investors are irrational and

become greedy as the RJF is too high. While RJFt < 1, fear is the dominant emotion in

the market and investors are afraid of the loss of beneﬁt. In addition, the higher proportion

of investors are bears who sell stocks in expectation of a drop of price. The investors stay

rational and the emotions are stable as RJF is around 1.

How RJF varies with time for investors of F-level and gender categories is shown in

Fig. 6, in which the original RJF is portrayed by the blue curves and its moving average

RJF with a ﬁxed window of 20 days is plotted in orange. According to RJF ’s variation, we

ﬁnd interesting emotional characteristics of diﬀerent investors. As can be seen in Fig. 6a,

RJF of F-level I gradually increases until middle of May 2015 and arrives at the peak of 3.78.

And with the recovery

of Chinese stock market, F-level I’s RJF rises again during October and November 2015.

The RJF of F-level II demonstrates a similar evolving trend with F-level I before August,

but investors in F-level II do not recover their conﬁdence with RJF being less than 1.0

almost throughout after October. Diﬀerent from investors in both F-level I and II, investors

in F-level III shows a continuous trend of RJF < 1, especially after the middle of May

2015 and then only ﬂuctuates slightly around 0.5, suggesting that experienced individual

investors and institutional investors lastingly aﬃrm the market is bearish after the steep

decline in June 2015.

C. Emotional volatility of investors in multiple categories

The diﬀerence in RJF of diverse investors can be further probed though the emotional

volatility, which is used to represent the stability of the conﬁdence to the market. And

lower emotional volatility accordingly suggests higher emotional stability. In previous study,

volatility (referring in particular to historical volatility in this paper) is a statistical measure

of the dispersion of returns for a given stock or market index and it can be simply measured

by using the standard deviation [36]. Using the same idea with stock volatility, here we

deﬁne the emotional volatility σR (call RJF R for short) as

N(cid:88)
t=1(Rt − µR)2

N

t=1

µR =

(cid:115)(cid:80)N

σR =

(3)

Considering the data set in this study covering a stage of dramatic change of the stock

market in China (see Fig. 3), the emotional volatility will indeed oﬀer more insights in

proﬁling investors’ emotional response to diﬀerent market performance. We measure σR

for investors of diﬀerent F-levels and gender, and the global RJF volatilities are shown in

Fig. 7. The global RJF volatilities of F-level I, II and III are respectively 0.500, 0.357

and 0.312. Accordingly, it can be concluded that the newbies of F-level I are sensitive to

the ﬂuctuation of stock market, however, experienced investors belonging to F-level III are

more emotionally stable. Conventional wisdom leads us to believe that women are more

emotional than men [10, 32] and RJF of female and male consistently indicate the same

insight that women are more emotionally expressive in the realm of Weibo referring to the

stock, possessing a higher global RJF volatility of 0.433 (which is only 0.312 for the male).

To highlight the variation of RJF volatility with stock market swing, we calculate the

moving average RJF volatility with the window of 20 days which are shown in Figs. 7c

rapidly to near 3300 on July 2015. The RJF volatility recovers to 0.65 on December 3rd,

volatility of F-level II users is below 0.45 and the peak value is above 0.4 between December

2014 and January 2015. However, the volatility continues falling with the turbulence of stock

market. Referring to F-level III investors, they are less emotional than other investors and

the maximum is even less than 0.22. They make it clear that the bear is coming before the

plunge in Chinese stock market. While from the perspective of gender, online emotions of

women ﬂuctuate widely between May and June in 2015, and the emotional volatility is over

0.6; for male investors, the volatility is almost below 0.3 and demonstrates a more stable

response.

atically investigated from the perspective of RJF and emotional volatility. It is surprisingly

disclosed that inexperienced investors, i.e., users with small numbers of followers in Weibo,

are more sensible to the market ﬂuctuation than the experienced or institutional ones. Con-

sidering the fact that inexperienced investors taking a dominant partition (over 98% in our

data set) of the Chinese market, their high volatility in conﬁdence to the market might

greatly magnify the market’s signals of growths or declines and results in collective but

emotional buys or sells, which will function negatively on the market itself. That’s to say,

the Chinese market might be signiﬁcantly emotional. These ﬁndings encourage us to further

investigate the correlation and even causality between emotion and stock in the following

section.

V. CORRELATION AND CAUSALITY BETWEEN EMOTIONS AND STOCK

MARKET

It is intuitive that the index of stock market will inﬂuence investors’ emotions, for exam-

ple, rising index brings joy but declining index produces fear or sadness. However, whether

emotions of investors function on the ﬂuctuation of the market, positively or negatively, still

remains unclear. Considering the dominant occupation of inexperienced users in the mar-

ket, we argue that the stock market in China is signiﬁcantly emotional and the connection

between emotions and the market deserves further explorations. In this section, by thor-

oughly investigating the statistical correlations between emotions and market attributes, we

demonstrate that emotions like joy and fear possess causal relations with the stock market

and can be promising features in developing prediction models for stocks in China. It is

worth noting that considering the tiny fraction of experienced or institutional investors (less

emotional) in the market, we do not discuss the correlation or causality for diﬀerent investors

in the following parts of the study.

A. Correlation between emotions and stock market

In the above section, we deﬁne the two groups of time series: X (represents online stock

market emotions) and Y (represents the stock market), which contribute to discuss the

17

correlation between online emotions and the stock market. However, the purpose of the

paper is to ﬁnd out whether online emotions can predict the stock market in China.

In

ﬁnance, the short-term stock prediction according to the past ﬁve trading days have the

highest explanatory power [23]. Supposing that online emotions in past ﬁve trading days

are available for short-term stock prediction, we shift emotion series to an earlier date: 1 to

5 days. Hence, each emotion corresponds to 5 time series according to shifted time. Each

category of online emotions can be deﬁned as (the categories of emotions are represented by

e, e = anger, sadness, joy, disgust, or f ear) Xe = (Xe,1, Xe,2, Xe,3, Xe,4, Xe,5).

For the analysis the relation of X and Y (T represents one certain time series of X or

Y ), we normalize all the time series, in which data items are transformed to the values from
0 to 1 as Ti = (Ti − Tmin)/(Tmax − Tmin). Ti is the i-th item in time series T , Tmax is the
maximal value of T , and Tmin is the minimal value of T . Then, by using Pearson correlation

analysis, we measure the linear dependence between x (Xe,t, the emotion e ahead of t days

in X) and y (one target of Y ) as ρ is the Pearson correlation coeﬃcient of time series x and
y which is deﬁned as ρ = Σ(xi−¯x)(yi−¯y)

√

Σ(xi−¯x)2Σ(yi−¯y)2

.

For observing whether there are distinct diﬀerences of correlation coeﬃcient between

online emotions and the stock market, we use bootstrap resampling method to estimate the

mean of correlation coeﬃcients, as well as the error bars in the mean [17, 40]. Bootstrapping

is often used with the purpose of deriving robust estimates of standard errors of a population

parameter like correlation coeﬃcients. Here, the emotion time series associated with stock

market time series are sampled 100 times.

In one time, we sample randomly 150 pairs

(from 191 pairs in the training set) of data items respectively from emotion time series

and stock market time series. We calculate 100 sampling results’ correlation coeﬃcients,

and then obtain the mean values and standard deviations. Fig. 8 shows the means and

error bars, which depicts sampling results’ correlation coeﬃcient. It can be seen that there

are signiﬁcant diﬀerences between diﬀerent emotions. In addition, we randomly shuﬄe the

time series 100 times and calculate the Pearson correlation coeﬃcient which is shown in

Fig. 9. As can be seen, the correlation coeﬃcients become zero for all emotions, implying

the signiﬁcance of our previously disclosed correlations with the market attributes.

Inspecting the correlation coeﬃcients above (shown in Fig. 8), we set the threshold of

correlation coeﬃcient ρ as 0.2 (the absolute value) and ﬁnd some interesting and valuable

results. The correlation between all online emotion time series (in X) and Yclose is very

18

low (ρ < 0.2), which indicates little linear dependence between them. As to Yopen, the

correlation coeﬃcients with Xf ear (ahead of 1, 3, 4 and 5 days), Xjoy (ahead of 1 day) and

Xdisgust (ahead of 1 and 5 days) are more than 0.2. Yopen is negatively correlated with Xf ear,

positively correlated with Xjoy and Xdisgust. As to Yhigh, the correlation coeﬃcients with

Xjoy (ahead of 2 days) and Xsadness (ahead of 2 days) are more than the threshold. Yhigh

is negatively correlated with Xjoy, positively correlated with Xsadness. Ylow and 5 types of

emotion time series have relatively high correlation, and the correlation coeﬃcients between
Ylow and Xsadness (ahead of 1 and 4 days) is the highest (|ρ| > 0.4). Ylow is negatively
correlated with Xanger, Xdisgust and Xjoy, positively correlated with Xsad and Xf ear. An

interesting ﬁnding is that the correlation between Yvolume and Xsadness (no matter ahead

of how many days) is unexpectedly high, correlation coeﬃcients ρ of which is more than

0.5. Besides, Yvolume and other online emotion time series don’t have a comparatively strong

(ρ > 0.2) correlation.

For further analysis, we inspect the correlation between targets and online emotions in

past 30 trading days. It turns out that correlation decreases as time ahead increases. Besides,

it is found that the predictive ability of the ﬁnancial time series approaches the maximum as

the ﬁve trading days in advance are considered [23]. Therefore, we take the online emotions

of the past ﬁve days into the account in building the prediction models.

B. Granger causality test of emotions and stock market

Despite the correlation analysis, we also preform the causality test further on the training

data. Here we apply the econometric approach named Granger causality test to study

the relation between online emotions and the stock market. The Granger Causality Test

is a statistical hypothesis test for determining whether one time series is functioning in

forecasting another. One time series x is said to Granger-cause y if it can be shown that

x provides statistically signiﬁcant information about future values of y, usually through a

series of t-tests and F -tests on lagged values of x. We perform the analysis according to

models shown in Eq 4 and 5 for the period from December 1st 2014 to September 16th 2015.

The Granger causality test could select only two time series as inputs. We apply Granger

causality test respectively on two groups: online emotion time series and stock market time

series. Delaying time is set to 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 days. According to diﬀerent delaying time,

we calculate the p-value to determine the results of hypothesis test. Here, the signiﬁcance

level is set to 5%.

We list testing results whose p-value is required to diﬀer signiﬁcant levels in Table I.

According to the results of Granger causality test, the null hypothesis, Xdisgust(lag = 1, 2)

series do not predict Yclose, with a high level of conﬁdence (p-value < 0.01) can be rejected.

However, the other emotions do not have causal relations with Yclose. Yopen and Xjoy (p-

value < 0.001), Xf ear (p-value < 0.001) and Xdisgust (p-value < 0.05 or even 0.01) have

causal relations. Xjoy, Xsadness and Xdisgust have causal relations with Yhigh and Ylow (p-

value < 0.05 or even 0.01). At last, the results also suggest trading volume in stock market

It’s surprising to ﬁnd that Xanger in online emotion time series does not have

The above analysis shows that Xdisgust, Xjoy, Xsadness and Xf ear can be promising features

for the stock prediction models, except for Xanger. Regarding to users of diﬀerent categories

like F-level I and II, the Granger causality test demonstrates the similar relations between

their emotions and the market. However, for the less emotional users in F-level III, it

is surprisingly found that their anger shows a slightly signiﬁcant Granger causality with

the market. Nevertheless, because the trivial proportion of these users in investors, their

anger accordingly contributes little to the prediction model based on aggregated emotions

discussed later and hence we do not oﬀer more discussions here.

VI. PREDICT THE STOCK MARKET

Firstly, in this section, based on discretization methods, regression problems of predicting

the stock market are converted to corresponding classiﬁcation problems. Next, we perform

linear and non-linear methods to solve the classiﬁcation problems of stock market prediction.

Eventually, the classiﬁcation models are validated by 5-fold cross-validation on training set

and we obtain a group of high-performance prediction models named SVM-ES.

For the prediction issue, we make use of the online emotion time series set (composed by

shifted time series with diﬀerent lags ranging from 1 to 5 for ﬁve emotions) or its subsets

within the period from December 1st 2014 to September 9th 2015. Setting the longest lag

to 5 trading days, the actual stock market time series are Y from December 8th 2014 to

September 16th 2015.

A. Discretization of stock market data

As illustrated in the previous sections, Yclose, Yopen, Yhigh, Ylow and Yvolume are our targets

of prediction in the stock market. Investors always just care for whether Yclose,i (the element

on i-th day in Yclose) are positive or negative, which will help investors make decisions to

conduct stock transactions, and the binary classiﬁcation (positive or negative) of Yclose and

Yopen are also the part of our targets for prediction.

Besides, we convert regression problems of predicting ﬁve attributes in the stock market to

classiﬁcation problems by discretization methods through which we classify each of attributes

to three categories. Speciﬁcally, Yclose, Yopen, Yhigh, and Ylow are divided into three categories:

bearish(-1), stable(0) and bullish(1) represented by CLOSE, OPEN, HIGH and LOW

below. Yvolume are divide into three categories: low(-1), normal(0) and high(1) represented

by VOLUME below.

The discretization of ﬁve attributes in the stock market is conducted by two methods:

equal frequency and K-means clustering. Equal frequency discretization is a simple but

eﬀective method that we sort items from large to small then cut them into 3 clusters of

even size. K-means clustering, another method we use, is popular for cluster analysis in

data mining. In this paper, K-means clustering aims to partition observations of the stock

market into 3 clusters in which each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest

distance. The results of three categories discretization by K-means are shown in Fig. 10

with 3 diﬀerent grey levels.

Intuitively, as compared to the approach of equal frequency, the discretization based on

K-means is more ﬂexible and adjustable to the dynamic of the market. The categories which

it generates can better reﬂect the actual market status (it is hard to say that the market will

rise, drop or keep stable with the same probability) and thus can oﬀer us a better benchmark

to test the prediction results.

24

B. Classiﬁcation model for stock prediction

In this paper, we perform machine learning methods, Logistic Regression (linear) and

Support Vector Machine (non-linear), to solve the classiﬁcation problems for stock predic-

tion. These methods are both popular for training binary or multiple classiﬁcation. To
predict the categories (−1, 0, 1) or (0, 1) (just for CLOSE and OPEN) of Y on i-th day, the
input attributes of our Logistic Regression model (LR) and Support Vector Machine model

(SVM) include only online emotion values of the past 5 days or a subset of them, except

for other variables in the ﬁeld of ﬁnance. We adapt 5-fold cross-validation to examine the

accuracies of models.

At the outset, we consider all ﬁve emotions of the past 5 days as the input attributes

of LR and SVM. The accuracies of models by 5-fold cross-validation are shown in Table II

(3-categories and 2-categories). For the classiﬁcation problem in this paper, the performance

of SVM is always better than that of LR. Therefore, we conjecture that, relation between

online emotions and the stock market is not simply linear, and non-linear prediction models

are suited to model the complex interactions of factors involved in shaping ﬁnancial market

values.

While 3-categories discretization (−1, 0, 1) results in the stock market as predicted tar-

gets, K-means clustering is always better than equal frequency discretization.

words, the accuracies of models by 5-fold cross-validation, of which predicted targets are the

results by K-means clustering, are relatively higher. Considering the categories generated by

K-means discretization better represent the market status, we can conclude that our models

indeed capture the essence of the stock ﬂuctuation. Note that for other K values like 5 or

7, it is hard to establish competent prediction models because of the sparsity and hence

the results are not reported. In fact, in realistic applications, it is suﬃcient for investors to

derive decisions from the prediction model of K = 3.

However, recalling the correlation analysis and Granger causality test of online emotions

and the stock market, not all the emotions play roles on predicting the stock market and

the analysis results should be used for the feature selection. Consequently, we build support

vector machine model based emotions selected (SVM-ES) for stock prediction (discretized

by K-means). The input attributes are based on analysis results of Granger causality test

and Pearson correlation. We select Xdisgust (ahead of 1, 2 days) for the SVM-ES to predict

of 1-3 day) and Xdisgust (ahead of 5 days) as the input attributes for predicting HIGH, and

Xsadness (ahead of 1 day), Xjoy (ahead of 1-3 day) and Xdisgust (ahead of 5 days) as the

input attributes for predicting LOW. Correlation analysis of Yvolume indicates that Yvolume

and Xsadness (ahead of 1-5 days) have the strongest correlation (ρ > 0.5) among all online

emotions, however, just using sadness as the learning feature surprisingly cannot guarantee

the expected performance. Thus, we try to select Xsadness (ahead 1-5 days) and Xf ear (ahead

1-5 days) which is the second strongest relation with Yvolume as the input attributes to predict

VOLUME.

After adjusting and ﬁxing the input attributes of SVM-ES, we train the models for stock

prediction. The last column of Table II shows the accuracy of 5-fold cross-validation, re-

spectively for 3-categories and 2-categories classiﬁcation models. There are slight diﬀerences

in performance between SVM-ES and the SVM trained using all the emotions, indicating

emotions selected are playing dominant roles in forecasting the market. It is noteworthy

that input attributes of all the SVM-ES don’t include anger and it’s surprising that anger

26

shown in online social media possesses the weakest correlation or even no relation with the

Chinese stock market.

From Table II it should be also noted that, emotions selected can boost the classiﬁcation

results attributes like OPEN, HIGH and LOW, while for CLOSE and VOLUME, SVM with

all emotions as features is still the most competent solution, with slight increment (around

1%) to SVM-ES (few attributes of input). This result explains that emotions except for

input attributes of SVM-ES have very weak eﬀects on the stock market prediction.

C. Evaluation in realistic application

To evaluate our prediction models, we sustain collecting stock-relevant tweets on Weibo

from September 17th to December 7th in 2015. We process these tweets and obtain online

emotion time series as our testing set. Then we apply our classiﬁcation models SVM-ES for

stock prediction in the realistic Chinese stock market and we can get the daily predictions

of ﬁve attributes before the market open. Framework of realistic application based on

SVM-ES is demonstrated in Fig. 11. We evaluate the stock market prediction application

and the accuracy is shown in Table III. It turns out that the model achieves the high

prediction performance, especially with accuracy of 64.15% for the intra-day highest index

(3-categories) and the accuracy of 60.38% for the trading volume (3-categories).

To further examine the robustness of predictive power of online emotions, we compare the

prediction performance of the models which take emotions time series or market time series

as the features. Inspired with traditional ﬁnancial time series forecasting researches [21, 22],

the baseline SVM models based on market return, named SVM-MR, are established. The

input attributes of SVM-MR are index return in the past ﬁve days, which are represented by

Closei−lag (lag = 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5). Besides, the prediction targets and the periods of training

set of two groups of models are identical. It can be seen from Table III that the performance

of SVM-ES models is always better than baselines. We can conclude that online emotions

oﬀer more predictive power than simple ﬁnancial time series.

We also evaluate the predictive power of online emotions extracted from diﬀerent cat-

egories of users. Using the identical method with SVM-ES, we build SVM models based

on ﬁve emotions from diﬀerent user types. We focus on two important targets, including

closing index (3-categories and 2-categories) and trading volume (3-categories). The results

27

Figure 11: Framework of realistic application for stock prediction based on SVM-ES.

in Table. IV show that the performance of models based on emotions from F-level I and

II is better than from F-level III. With closing index as the target, the accuracy of the

model based on F-level III is even worse than the random result. The phenomenon could

be explained by “Eﬃcient Market Hypothesis”. According to hypothesis, the stock market

will follow a random walk pattern and cannot be predicted while every investor in market is

rational. Therefore, it is not available to predict the market only by using online emotions

of rational investment experts. In comparison, the performance of SVM-ES, which consid-

ers emotions from various kinds of users, is excellent. It concludes that the aggregation of

emotions from all investors in Weibo have more predictive power than any single investor

category. An explanation for this phenomenon can be the market is aﬀected by emotions

and behaviors from categories of investors. Online emotions in whole social media, rather

than its subset, can reﬂect the overall market status.

VII. CONCLUSION

Focusing on the stock market in China, we collect massive stock-relevant tweets in Weibo

and label them with ﬁve categories of sentiments. By deﬁning the emotional volatility, it is

the ﬁrst to reveal that inexperienced investors (over 98%) are more sensible to the market

ﬂuctuations than the experienced or institutional ones, suggesting the Chinese market is

emotional. Then the correlation analysis and Granger causality test are performed. We

suggest there may be signiﬁcant potential for short-term prediction based on the online

emotions of the past ﬁve days. Both analysis results show that disgust, joy, sadness and fear

can be used to predict the price and volume of the stock mark. Based on these, we establish

several models to predict the closing index, the opening index, the intra-day highest index,

the intra-day lowest index and trading volume. The results show that our model SVM-ES

can outperform baseline solutions. Finally, we also testify its performance in the realistic

application and compare it with the model based on market return.

In conclusion, our

ﬁndings conﬁrm that the stock market in China can be predicted by various online emotions.

Indeed, social media provides a valuable data source for researchers and companies where

publicly available tweets can be retrieved as well as analyzed with the help of machine

learning technologies. In this study, we argue that from the perspective of computational

social science, tweets in Weibo can be excellent proxies in probing the ﬁnancial market and

corresponding emotions. In addition, to our best knowledge, we are the ﬁrst to establish

that, there are signiﬁcant diﬀerences of emotional responses from types of online users while

facing the changing market. Therefore, the behavioral diﬀerences should be considered when

29

studying the relationship between social media and real world.

According to the competent performance of models in realistic application, our results

have strong implications for investors as well as the entire stock market in China. The

ﬁnancial industry might integrate online emotions into traditional prediction models to make

better trading decisions. Even the combination of sentiment analysis with classical capital

market models would be an interesting ﬁeld and promising direction in behavioral ﬁnancial.

This study has inevitable limitations, which might be interesting directions in the future

work. For example, how the connection between emotion and market evolves with time is
