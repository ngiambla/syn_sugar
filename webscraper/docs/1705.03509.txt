Abstract 

Recently,  “platform  ecosystem”  has  received  attention  as  a  key  business  concept. 
Sustainable growth of platform ecosystems  is  enabled  by platform users  supplying 
and/or demanding content from each other: e.g. Facebook, YouTube or Twitter. The 
importance  and  value  of  user  data  in  platform  ecosystems  is  accentuated  since 
platform  owners  use  and  sell  the  data  for  their  business.  Serious  concern  is 
increasing about data misuse or abuse, privacy issues and revenue sharing between 
the different stakeholders. Traditional data governance focuses on generic goals and 
a universal approach to manage the data of an enterprise. It entails limited support 
for  the  complicated  situation  and  relationship  of  a  platform  ecosystem  where 
multiple  participating  parties  contribute,  use  data  and  share  profits.  This  article 
identifies  data  governance  factors  for  platform  ecosystems  through  literature 
review.  The  study  then  surveys  the  data  governance  state  of  practice  of  four 
platform  ecosystems:  Facebook,  YouTube,  EBay  and  Uber.  Finally,  19  governance 
models  in  industry  and  academia  are  compared  against  our  identified  data 
governance factors for platform ecosystems to reveal the gaps and limitations.

Introduction 

Data Governance for Platform Ecosystems 
 

Gawer (2009) defines platforms as the building blocks that act as a foundation upon which an array of 
firms-  sometimes  called  a  business  ecosystem  or  platform  ecosystem  (our  preferred  name)  can 
develop complementary products, technologies or services. A platform ecosystem is multi-sided due to 
different types of firms or user groups transacting with each other (Smedlund & Faghankhani 2015). 
For example, YouTube has a group which provides videos (side one), and another group watches the 
videos  (side  two).  The  groups  facilitate  various  benefits  and  grow  by  providing  data  by  themselves 
(Evans 2011). This is a so called network effect which is regarded as a key business concept of platform 
ecosystems.  Platform  owners  (e.g.  YouTube)  use  user  data  (both  user  content  and  non-content  like 
logs or service use history) for their business. It ultimately leads to critical mass and high revenue. 

As the ecosystems have  been growing rapidly, there are worries of data abuse, privacy violation and 
proper distribution of profit generated by data. The article titled, “7 Controversial Ways Facebook Has 
Used Your Data” was reported (Luckerson 2014). It discloses surprising things Facebook can do with 
user data: e.g. tracking user movements or using user data in ads without consent. According to this 
article, Facebook paid more than $20 million for lawsuit settlement by disgruntled users. There is also 
reported danger of data abuse by platform users, partners or employees (Constantin 2011; Tate 2010).  

By  looking  at  the  example  of  Facebook,  poor  implementation  or  lack  of  data  governance  can  have 
significantly destructive effects on success: e.g. losing control of the use of data, lawsuit by disgruntled 
users and low quality data (Hagiu 2014). Platform owners should overcome these to win markets, and 
thus to lock the users in the platforms (Parker & Van Alstyne 2014). Meanwhile, platform users need 
to be guaranteed that their data is safe and transparently managed by the platform owners.  

Data  governance  in  the  past  usually  refers  to  the  overall  management  of  the  “ilities”  (availability, 
usability, security and privacy) of the data within an enterprise when there is usually clear ownership 
of data and purpose of use. There is limited research in understanding how data governance should be 
managed  in  a  platform  ecosystem  when  there  are  multiple  parties  contributing,  deriving  and  using 
data and the ownership, access, usage and profit sharing of collected data and derived data (through 
data  transformation/analysis).  We  have  not  been  able  to  find  a  data  governance  model  for  platform 
ecosystems. Thus, we aim to provide the first study into data governance for platform ecosystems. 

The  key  contributions  are  threefold.  Firstly,  this  paper  assists  researchers  in  understanding  data 
governance  in  the  context  of  platform  ecosystems  by  conducting  an  extensive  literature  review  and 
case studies. The case studies show how data governance is implemented in representative  platform 
ecosystems:  Facebook,  YouTube,  EBay  and  Uber  (the  state  of  practice).  Secondly,  we  highlight  data 
governance factors that should be considered when platform owners implement data governance. In 
addition,  we  identify  the  gaps  and  limitations  of  existing  governance  frameworks  for  platform 
ecosystems (state of the art) to discuss future research direction. 

In  the  next  section,  we  present  a  literature  review.  We  then  explain  the  methodology  of  this  study. 
Next,  we  propose  our  data  governance  factors  for  platform  ecosystems.  Thereafter,  we  present  the 
state of practice in industry platform ecosystems and the gaps  in existing governance models. In the 
last section, we conclude the paper, and discuss limitations of the study. 

Literature Review 

Governance  refers  to  comprehensive  control  including  processes,  policies  and  structures.  There  are 
multiple  types  of  governance:  e.g.  IT/information/data/platform/social  network  service  (SNS) 
governance.  IT  governance  supports  right  decision  making  about  IT  assets,  but  data  governance 
focuses on data assets (Khatri & Brown 2010). The term information governance is often used in the 
same  sense  as  data  governance  by  some  authors  (Faria  et  al.  2013),  but  it  focuses  on  information 
issues  rather  than  individual  data  pieces  (Dimick  2013).  All  types  of  governance  are  related  to  each 
other (Dimick 2013), and share many characteristics (Kamioka et al. 2016). In general, higher level of 
governance  includes 
level  of  governance  as  a  part.  IT  governance  often  addresses 
information/data  governance,  and  information  governance  includes  data  governance  (Faria  et  al. 
2013).  Thus,  lower  levels  of  governance  should  align  with  the  goals  and  concepts  of  higher-level 
governance.  Weill  and  Ross  (2004  and  2005)  emphasized  that  IT  governance  should  align  with 
organizational  goals. Khatri and Brown (2010) showed how data governance decision domains align 
with those of IT governance. In industry, a goal cascading mechanism shows that stakeholder’s needs, 
enterprise goals, IT-related goals and information/data level goals must be aligned (ISACA 2012).

Data Governance for Platform Ecosystems 
 

Governance for platform ecosystems (including SNSs) should consider the different business context. 
Platform  ecosystems  provide  a  meeting  place,  and  facilitate  interactions  between  two  participating 
groups  (Evans  2011).  Platform  ecosystems  manage  the  users’  data,  which  is  uploaded  or  generated 
through these interactions. There is a general consensus in the literature that roles, revenue sharing, 
trust and control are key governance concepts for platform ecosystems (Schreieck et al. 2016; Hein et 
al 2016; Tiwana et al. 2010). Roles refer to ownership status (Schreieck et al. 2016). Revenue sharing 
concepts are focused in prior research as it supports network effects (Schreieck et al. 2016; Parker & 
Van  Alstyne  2014;  Tang  et  al.  2012).  Trust  between  platform  owners  and  users  is  regarded  as  a 
prerequisite factor to success. Control has been addressed in the literature as a vital factor for the use 
of a successful platform ecosystem (Evans 2011; Ghazawneh & Henfridsson 2010 and 2013; Manner et 
al. 2012; Tiwana et al. 2010 and 2013).  

These  governance  concepts  should  be  implemented  in  data  governance  of  platform  ecosystems  to 
encourage desirable behavior of all participating groups, and to create value in the use of data (Weber 
et  al.  2009;  Kamioka  et  al.  2016).  In  addition,  the  relevant  issues  and  challenges  claimed  by 
researchers should be considered. Unclear data ownership (Kaisler et al. 2012 and 2013; Jagadish et 
al. 2014), the importance of user contribution model (Tang et al. 2012; Parker and Van Alstyne 2014; 
Chai et al. 2009) and invisible data usage (Kristen 2015) are identified as critical issues. However, in 
platform ecosystem research, data governance has received little attention (Schreieck et al. 2016).  

In some platform governance literature, SNS governance has been identified since SNS is regarded as 
a representative type of platform ecosystem (Evans 2012).  In the literature, focus is also on behavior 
control  of  users  (Evans  2012),  input  and  output  control  or  privacy  violation  (Hein  et  al.  2016)  of 
monitoring  and  conformance  mechanisms.  Some  of  the  studies  include  case  studies  to  present  the 
state  of  practice  of  SNSs  (e.g.  Facebook)  in  governance  structure,  control,  trust  &  risk  relevant 
mechanisms.  The  studies  provide  good  information  for  understanding  real  situations,  but  there  is  a 
lack  of  consideration  of  how  data  should  be  addressed.  Web  2.0  has  been  addressed  as  an  enabling 
tool  for  platform  ecosystems  on  the  technology  level  (Prasad  et  al.  2012)  rather  than  at  the  (data) 
governance level.  

Research  on  IT  governance  provides  key  decision  domains,  concepts  and  principles  of  governance 
(Weill & Woodham 2002; Weill & Ross 2004 and 2005) which can be also used in data governance of 
platform ecosystems. Industry standards or frameworks such as ISO/IEC 38500 or Control Objectives 
for Information and Related Technologies  (COBIT) deliver  high-level  principles and broad guidance 
for  all  size  and  domain  organizations  (Chaudhuri  2011;  Calder  2008;  Sylvester  2011).  COBIT,  in 
particular,  addresses  information/data  governance  in  the  framework  to  support  its  implementation 
(Sylvester  2011).  Meanwhile,  there  is  less  research  on  information/data  governance  (Weber  et  al. 
2009;  Kamioka  et  al.  2016).  Khatri  and  Brown  (2010)  introduced  a  generic  framework  to  support 
designing  data  governance.  The  framework  addresses  a  broad  range  of  data  governance  areas,  and 
provides  a  basic  source  of  practices  for  data  governance  for  platform  ecosystems.  Industry 
information/data governance frameworks provide comprehensive elements to support universal goals 
of better decision making for companies (Weber et al. 2009). The frameworks provide  a goal-driven 
approach (Begg & Caira 2011) to achieve organizational goals. Thus, those frameworks do not address 
governance issues crossing organizations or when there are multiple participant types.  

In  conclusion,  there  are  many  academic  research  and  industry  governance  frameworks.  However, 
there  is  little  research  on  data  governance  in  the  context  of  platform  ecosystems.  Furthermore, 
existing  industry  frameworks  focus  on  generic  information  strategy  or  data  management  of 
organizations. In “State of the Art” section, the gaps and limitations of existing industry and research 
models are shown in detail. 

Methodology 

Methodology of the Literature Review 

The  literature  review  was  performed  in  three  steps  following  a  lightweight  systematic  literature 
review: keyword searching, backward and forward searching and literature review based on selection 
criteria. We used specific query including exchangeable keywords based on Manner et al.’s approach 
(2012)  to  look  for  publications  that  address  platform  governance:  ((Platform  Ecosystem  OR  multi-
sided  platform  OR  two-sided  platform)  AND  (governance  OR  management)).  Through  the  keyword 
searching,  we  found  the  most  recent  and  relevant  three  Systematic  Literature  Review  (SLR)  papers 
regarding platform governance (Schreieck et al. 2016; Hein et al 2016; Manner et al. 2012). Backward 
and  forward  searching  were  used  to  include  more  literature  and  to  review  the  latest  studies.  As  a

result, we got 231 papers. We filtered them to include suitable papers regarding platform governance, 
and  to  exclude  those  which  focus  on  specific  domains  or  technologies  (Table  1).  To  do  so,  we  first 
looked at the title to find platform governance studies. We then conducted quick review (looking at the 
abstract, introduction and conclusion) to confirm whether the topic is really relevant or not. After this, 
we got 73 papers, and then 16 duplicated papers were removed. Finally, we reviewed the full content 
of  57  papers  and  selected  papers  which  explicitly  deal  with  governance  concepts,  factors  or 
mechanisms in the context of platform ecosystem.

Methodology for the Data Governance Factors 

We  focused  on  both  platform  governance  concepts  and  current  issues/challenges  claimed  by 
researchers  which  should  be  addressed  in  data  governance  for  platform  ecosystems.  We  conducted 
three stages to identify data governance factors and to verify them (Figure 1).  

The first stage (step 1~5) was carried out through academic literature review. First of all, we identified 
four platform governance concepts (Hein et al. 2016; Schreieck et al. 2016) (step 1). We then found six 
critical  issues  in  prior  research  which  are  related  to  the  four  concepts,  and  should  be  solved  for 
platform ecosystems (Kaisler et al. 2012 and 2013; Jagadish et al. 2014; Tang et al. 2012; Chai et al. 
2009) (step 2). In order to find the corresponding data governance factors, we analyzed 14 academic 
works  (step  3).  The  identified  factors  were  examined  if  the  factors  are  relevant  to  the  six  issues: 
relevancy (step 4), and if they also are consistent with the four governance concepts: alignment (step 
5).  Through  this  process,  we  identified  six  data  governance  factors  (F1~6  in  Figure  1).  The  stage  2 
(step  3~5)  was  conducted  to  verify  and  refine  the  factors  (and  to  find  missing  factors).  Five  widely 
used industry governance frameworks were analyzed and examined. We did not find any extra factors 
from the frameworks, but we could confirm the identified factors in the industry frameworks. As the 
last stage (step 3~5), we verified and refined the factors by looking at the practices of four platforms: 
Facebook,  Uber,  YouTube  and  EBay.  We  surveyed  good  practices  in  real  situations.  “Reporting 
system” is discovered as one type of monitoring mechanisms (for F3, monitoring factor).  

Through  the  three  stages,  we  got  six  data  governance  factors,  and  then  added  one  factor  (F7, 
contribution  estimation)  to  address  “Lack  of  user  contribution  model”  issue  and  to  align  “Revenue 
sharing” concept of platform governance. In total, seven data governance factors were identified.

Methodology of the Case Studies 

The  case  studies  were  performed  to  present  the  state  of  practice  of  platform  ecosystems.  We 
categorized platform ecosystems into three types based on Evans’ suggestion (2012): social networks 
(e.g. Facebook or Twitter), content portals (e.g. YouTube or LinkedIn) and product/service exchanges 
(e.g.  EBay,  Uber  or  Amazon).  To  decide  target  platforms,  platform’s  ranking,  size  (i.e.  active  users) 
and business model were used as the selection criteria. Based on the criteria, Facebook, YouTube and 
EBay  were  selected  as  representative  platforms.  Uber  was  additionally  chosen  as  a  newcomer  for 
service/product exchanges to compare with the other three large and traditional platform ecosystems.

The studies were conducted by examining their policies: terms and conditions, privacy or data policy 
(Table 2) because a policy is a central component of governance to represent its concept and to govern 
the platform ecosystems (ISACA 2012; Schreieck et al. 2016). Furthermore, it is visible and accessible.

Data Governance Factors for Platform Ecosystems 

We  differentiate  between  traditional  data  governance  for  an  enterprise  and  data  governance  for  a 
platform ecosystem. We focus on specific governance factors to manage the complicated situation and 
relationship of a platform ecosystem. Therefore, we do not discuss here all the data governance factors 
which can appear in a universal data governance model. We identified seven data governance factors 
based on our approach (Figure 1), and then categorized them into two governance domains (Table 3).

Table 3. The Identified Data Governance Factors for Platform Ecosystems 

(1)  Data  ownership  and  access  definition:  presents  who  owns  and  uses  the  data  in  platform 
ecosystems. It has been the focus as a central concept of platform design (Tiwana 2013; Thomas et al. 
2014; Schreieck et al. 2016). The definition for all types of data should be clarified to support revenue 
sharing and to keep control of data flow in platform ecosystems. The definition can be used to protect 
data  against  unauthorized  use  from  the  platform  owners’  perspective.  Meanwhile,  from  the  users’ 
perspective,  it  can  be  regarded  as  a  reward.  Responsible,  Accountable,  Consulted,  and  Informed 
(RACI) approach is applicable to define data ownership, but it can be expanded to include “Accessible” 
for the definition of access rights for platform ecosystems. 

(2) Definition criteria: refers to the regulatory environment that could affect the ownership and use of 
the data in platform ecosystems (Khatri & Brown 2010). Platform users place their data on the Web 
such as Facebook, YouTube or Twitter. Unclear ownership of the data in the servers entails a serious 
issue  which  may  have  to  be  resolved  in  court  (Kaisler  et  al.  2012  and  2013).  Therefore,  identifying 
relevant regulations and laws regarding all types of data in platform ecosystems is necessary. Defining 
an  explicit  data  owner  should  be  implemented  according  to  the  identified  regulations.  A  decision 
model based on legal aspects, and a mechanism to track and notify the compliance of the rules should 
be applied in data governance for platform ecosystems.

Data Governance for Platform Ecosystems 
 

(3)  Contribution  estimation:  is  a  mechanism  to  measure  user  contribution  against  value  creation  by 
providing data. This is necessary to support revenue sharing, to encourage high-quality resources and 
to  repress  poor-quality  resources  of  platform  ecosystems.  For  this  reason,  user  contribution 
measurement  refers  to  a  central  factor  of  the  business  models  of  platform  ecosystems  (Tang  et  al. 
2012), and a platform must impose certain regulations on the user participation to reap the benefits of 
ecosystem  growth  (Parker  &  Van  Alstyne  2014).  However,  there  is  no  consideration  of  user 
contribution especially in derived and non-content data in research and industry governance models. 
A contribution measurement model should be adopted for accurately identifying, acknowledging and 
rewarding the contributors based on the platforms’ incentive strategy (Chai et al. 2009). 

(4) Data use case: is related to how to use the data in platform ecosystems. Recently, how to share or 
sell data without losing control has become a central issue to both platform owners and platform users 
as the value of the data in a platform is increasing. For this, first of all, understanding different types 
of data is important (Khatri and Brown 2010). Data categories of platform ecosystems should include 
various sources of data (not only user content): i.e. data from users, systems and business processes 
(Firmani et al. 2016). In addition, the use cases and the relevant stakeholders of the data (including 
individual use case for each data category) should be clearly defined and linked. The consistency and 
integrity of the cases must be considered over the lifecycle of the data to support a visible data supply 
chain. This factor supports both data ownership and data usage governance domains. 

(5) Conformance: is defined as an audit for compliance based on strict processes and rules. Recently, 
misuse  or  abuse  of  personal  data  has  been  regarded  as  the  most  controversial  topic  because  of  a 
privacy issue. To cope with the issue, minimizing illegal use of identifiable personal data and focusing 
on  data  due  processes  are  required  (Martin  2015).  That  is,  platform  owners  should  consider 
conformance checking in their data governance. Apple’s review process to assess every application and 
content  against their regulations is a good  example  (Ghazawneh & Henfridsson 2010). A number of 
industry governance models and academic research have addressed this as a compulsory aspect.  

(6)  Monitoring:  Data  flow  should  be  monitored  (Tiwana  2014).  Invisible  supply  chain  is  a  long-
standing  challenge,  but  little  research  has  focused  on  this  (Schreieck  2016).  A  targeted  advertising 
mechanism shows how user data is used through invisible and hidden markets (Craig & John 2015). 
To  overcome  this  issue,  data  stewardship  practices  and  a  visible  supply  chain  are  necessary  (Martin 
2015).  Platform  owners  should  take  into  account  platform  users’  needs  for  traceability  of  who/what 
has accessed or modified data in a data supply chain (Khatri & Brown 2010). Thus, strict monitoring 
processes,  including  reporting  by  users,  should  be  considered  to  detect  and  notify  all  activities 
(including internal activities by platform owners and external activities by their partners or the users). 

(7)  Data  provenance:  means  to  trace  the  derivation  history  of  the  data  transparently  for  all 
participating groups. Metadata is a foundational element to provide transparency and visibility of the 
use of data (Informatica 2013). Standardizing metadata should be considered for tracking information 
of the data in platform ecosystems (Khatri & Brown 2010). Data provenance should be retrieved and 
analyzed through the whole life cycle. In addition, shared data or derived data through transformation 
or analysis has to be considered for the original data owner (contributor). 

The State of Practice (Case Studies on Platform Ecosystems) 

In this section, we present the state of the practice of four platform ecosystems: Facebook, YouTube, 
EBay  and  Uber.  The  purpose  of  the  case  studies  is  to  show  how  the  platforms  implement  data 
governance. To survey the four platforms, we used seven practices of our data governance factors: P1, 
P2, P6, P9, P10, P15 and P18 in Tables 3. The practices used here were selected based on visibility in 
the  policies  from  the  platform  users’  perspective.  The  practices  of  “definition  criteria”  and 
“conformance” factors were excluded due to invisibility of those practices. Instead, “data provenance” 
was included to examine whether platform users (data contributors) can trace their data history. 

The Result Criteria 

We firstly tested if the platforms’ documentation shows implementation of the seven practices. If their 
policies provide information regarding the practices, we conclude the practices satisfy “Existence”. We 
then  examined  if  their  data  category,  ownership,  access  and  data  use  case  definition  practices 
(relevant practices: P1, P2, P9 and P10) address all types of data:  “Sufficiency” of the data types.  As 
mentioned in the previous  section, we categorized data into three (user content,  system and process 
data) based on the source of the data (Firmani et al. 2016).

Example 1: data ownership practice of Facebook (P1). 
  Facebook (their policies) provides information of data ownership definition (i.e. they say who owns 

the data in the platform in their policies). Thus, “Existence” is satisfied. 

  We then looked at the policies in detail to judge if the data ownership definition addresses the three 
types of data (user, system and process data). Facebook clearly mentions who owns user uploaded 
data (user content), but does not mention who owns non-content data (i.e. system and process data 
like  logs  or  service  use  histories).  In  this  case,  “Sufficiency”  is  not  satisfied  because  Facebook 
appears to only satisfy one type of data out of three. 

  We conclude Facebook "partially implements” the practice (P1) as only “Existence” is satisfied. 

Example 2: data ownership practice of EBay (P1). 
  We found no information by EBay regarding this practice. Thus, “Existence” is not satisfied. 
  Sufficiency is not examined as there is no information to test. Thus, “Sufficiency” is not satisfied. 
  We  conclude  EBay  documentation  does  "not  implement”  the  practice  as  both  criteria  are  not 

satisfied. 

As above examples, a final result is “Not Implemented”, “Partially Implemented” or “Implemented”. 

The Results of the case studies 

  P1.  Define  data  ownership:  The  existence  of  “information  of  data  ownership  definition”  and 
sufficiency  of  “collected  data  types  (user  content/system  data/process  data)”  are  used  for  this 
practice.  The  four  platforms’  documents  do  not  satisfy  the  criteria.  Facebook,  YouTube  and  Uber 
define  data  ownership  of  user  content.  However,  non-user  content  (system/process  data)  is  not 
addressed. EBay documents overlook data ownership. 

  P2. Define data access rights: We surveyed the existence of “information of access rights definition” 
and  sufficiency  of  “collected  data  types  (user  content/system  data/process  data)”.  Facebook 
provides detailed information regarding access rights for  platform users. However, the other three 
platforms pay attention to user content  only as in P1. Who can access and use non-user content is 
not  clearly  mentioned  in  the  documents.  Furthermore,  it  is  not  clear  when  platform  owners’ 
permission will be terminated. YouTube, EBay and Uber do not provide information regarding data 
owner’s permission withdrawal.  

  P6.  Consider contributors’  effort for  value creation:  We examined the existence of “information of 
revenue sharing mechanisms”. The documents indicate that users can use their services  since they 
provide their data, and agree with the policies. Information concerning a reward program for a data 
contributor was not found in the four platforms’ policies. 

  P9. Define data categories of a platform: The existence of “information of the collected data by the 
platforms”  and  sufficiency  of  “all  data  types  (user  content/system  data/process  data)”  are  used  to 
survey  this  practice.  All  the  platforms  provide  information  about  “collected  data”  such  as  user 
content,  system  data  (logs  or  cookies)  and  process  data  (service  use  history).  Facebook  provides 
detailed  data  categories  (70  separated  categories).  YouTube,  EBay  and  Uber  present  two  or  three 
main categories including the detailed sub-categories. This practice is fully documented by all. 

  P10. Define general data use cases and individual use cases of each data category: The existence of 
“purpose of the use of collected data” and sufficiency of “addressed data types (user content/system 
data/process data)” are surveyed. General purpose of the use of data is well documented by all the 
platforms:  e.g.  for  better services, communications, safety and security or personalized ads.  While 
YouTube explains the purpose of the use of each data category (e.g. a user profile name and photos 
for  displaying  the  account  information),  Facebook,  EBay  and  Uber  are  not  fully  satisfied  by  the 
criteria. We found the three platforms provide several examples of the purpose of system data such 
as user cookies or locations. The other types of data were not found.  

  P15.  Monitor  to  achieve  visibility  of  the  data  supply  chain:  The  existence  of  “information  of 
monitoring  mechanisms  of  the  use  of  data”  is  used  as  a  key  decision  criterion  to  judge  if  the 
platforms implement this practice. A limitation in investigating this practice is that we cannot access 
the  whole  governance  systems  of  the  platforms.  The  documents  show  that  all  platforms  do  not 
provide  enough  capability  for  platform  users  to  detect  the  use  of  their  data.  They  offer  report 
systems to claim abuse of data or services, but there are limitations in seeing transparent data flow. 

  P18.  Trace all the derivation history of the data in the platforms: The  existence of “information of 
tracking mechanisms and retained data” is important to understand the data provenance systems of 
the  platforms.  We  investigated  how  the  platforms  provide  history  of  the  data,  including  retained

data, to the data owner (contributors). However, we observed that this practice is not implemented. 
We found no information regarding data provenance mechanisms for users in their policies.

Discussion 

We identified some significant issues in data governance of the four platforms. Firstly, we found a lack 
of consideration of various sources of data. The platforms focus  on user content, but it is not clearly 
defined  who  owns  or  uses  non-user  content  (e.g.  logs,  keywords  or  purchase  history).  As  stated 
previously,  various  types  of  data  should  be  considered  in  every  governance  decision  domain.  The 
owner of data should be clearly identified to reduce uncertainty and argument between participating 
groups. Secondly, data flow in the supply chain is not visible to platform users. The platforms’ policies 
are  imprecise,  and  thus  how,  when,  and  who  uses  the  data  are  not  clear.  This  issue  is  claimed  in 
previous research as one of the critical challenges and ethical issues (Kaisler et al. 2013; Martin 2015). 
This issue should be resolved to keep trust between platform owners and the users, and to succeed in 
the  business  (Schreieck  et  al.  2016;  Hein  et  al.  2016).  To  overcome  this,  monitoring  and  data 
provenance systems should be strengthened. Lastly, absence of consideration for data contributors is 
identified  as  one  of  the  critical  issues.  To  encourage  network  effects,  user  participation  should  be 
rewarded as platform users always expect immediate rewards or future benefits (Tang et al. 2012). 

State of the Art (Existing Governance Models) 

We analyzed currently used industry and research governance models to reveal gaps and limitations 
based on our identified data governance factors (Table 3). To do so, we categorized governance areas 
into  three  parts:  IT  governance,  information/data  governance,  and  governance  for  platform 
ecosystems  (including  SNS  governance).  We  reviewed  widely  recognized  or  used  frameworks  of  IT 
governance and data governance. For instance, COBIT was selected because it is the best known and 
most widely used framework (Weber et al. 2009). The Weill IT governance, the Khatri and Brown, and 
the  Weber  et  al.’s  model  were  also  included  as  their  studies  have  been  widely  referenced  by  other 
researchers  in  the  area.  For  the  platform  governance  studies  category,  we  included  studies  which

Data Governance for Platform Ecosystems 
 

address platform governance approaches, concepts or factors based on our criteria mentioned  in the 
methodology section. Eight platform governance studies were finally chosen.  

The Result Criteria  

As in the previous section, we used “Sufficiency” to decide if the models have concern of the suggested 
data  governance  factors.  For  this,  we  used  all  practices  of  each  factor  (Table  3).  A  final  result  was 
determined “Not Covered”, “Partially Covered” or “Covered” based on the coverage of the practices.

The result was tabulated to show the summary of the analysis (Table 5).

Table 5. The Results of an Analysis of Existing Governance Models 

There is no industry IT governance framework or studies that address “contribution estimation” and 
“data provenance”. In contrast, responsibility and accountability (data ownership) are emphasized by 
the  surveyed  models.  ISO/IEC  38500  and  COBIT  stresses  clarity  of  role,  responsibility  and 
accountability through RACI definition (Chaudhuri 2011; ISACA 2012). Weill’s studies with Woodham 
(2002) and Ross (2004 and 2005) focus on the importance of IT (data) emphasizing the role of IT to 
meet  the  business  goal.  “Definition  criteria”  for  data  ownership  is  also  considered  as  a  part  of  IT 
architecture  concern  in  their  studies.  However,  the  five  industry  frameworks  and  research  focus  on 
traditional concerns of responsibility and accountability  within an enterprise. Thus, there is a critical 
lack of access rights concern from platform users’ perspective. “Conformance and Monitoring” factors 
are partially covered by the frameworks. Yet, there is no concern of data supply chain visibility.  

In information/data governance models, as in the IT governance category, “contribution estimation” 
is  not  considered.  “Data  provenance”  is  regarded  as  one  area  of  major  concern  by  the  Informatica 
framework  (Informatica  2013).  The  framework  describes  that  data  lineage  is  necessary  to  support 
metadata  of  critical  data  and  to  provide  transparency  and  visibility  of  the  flow  of  data.  The  IBM 
information  governance  model  also  address  this  factor.  The  model,  however,  focuses  on 
organizational data flow through transformations and processing of data (Ballard et al. 2014), rather 
than platform ecosystem context. The Khatri and Brown model also includes data provenance concern 
(Khatri & Brown 2010). The model aims to provide governance design concepts. Thus, it doesn’t draw 
attention  to  the  detailed  and  accurate  study  of  the  factor.  “Data  ownership/access  definition”  is 
covered  by  all  the  surveyed  information/data  governance  models.  Industry  models,  in  particular, 
focus  on  this  factor.  The  DGI  framework  fully  covers  this  in  the  core  components  (Thomas  2006). 
Access  rights  control  is  described  as  a  role  of  Data  Governance  Office  (DGO).  The  Informatica 
framework also mentions data ownership and access with concern for transparent and clear policies

Data Governance for Platform Ecosystems 
 

(Informatica  2013).  However,  the  instruction  level  is  very  high.  Weber  et  al.  (2009)  and  Otto  and 
Weber  (2015)’s  studies  partially  cover  data  ownership/access  concern  by  focusing  on  assignment  of 
roles to tasks to define clear responsibilities. Their typical data governance approach for an in-house 
control mechanism is recognized as the limitation. That is, external stakeholders (i.e. platform users) 
are not considered in the studies. “Data access rights” of stakeholders is similarly not involved. “Data 
use  case”  factor  is  addressed  by  two  frameworks.  The  IBM  model  addresses  this  concern  by 
emphasizing the role of data steward for all information/data sources (Ballard et al. 2014). Yet, there 
is a lack of relationship between data use case and the relevant stakeholders. In contrast, the Khatri 
and  Brown  model  includes  all  the  practices  of  the  factor.  However,  there  is  a  limitation  to  use  in 
practice  because  the  abstraction  level  is  high.  The  importance  of  “conformance  and  monitoring”  is 
emphasized  in  the  Informatica  framework  by  mentioning  compliance  with  the  organization’s 
requirements  (Informatica  2013).  However,  other  frameworks  do  not  cover  or  partially  cover  the 
factors.  The  DGI  framework  presents  “monitoring”  as  one  of  the  role  of  data  governance  office,  but 
how to achieve and maintain visibility of a data supply chain is missing. 

Platform  governance  studies  mainly  concentrate  on  “conformance  and  monitoring”  factors.  Evans 
(2012)  has  an  interest  in  how  platform  ecosystems  can  govern  bad  behavior  by  platform  users. 
Meanwhile,  Ghazawneh  and  Henfridsson  (2010  and  2013)  addressed  regulation-based  securing  to 
control a platform ecosystem through boundary resources such as APIs, documents or data. They had 
a focus on a conformation mechanism such as due processes of administrative legislation. Manner et 
al. (2012 and 2013) also introduced control mechanisms which include monitoring and a conformance 
concept.  Tiwana  et  al.  (2010  and  2013)  addressed  output  and  process  control  as  a  “conformance” 
concept  to  ensure  desirable  outcomes  and  verify  compliance.  “Monitoring”  of  user  behaviors  in 
accordance with prescribed methods and criteria is also emphasized. Data ownership and access are 
also  discussed with incentives issues (Tiwana et al. 2010; Tiwana 2013). The discussion, however, is 
not  sufficient  to  clearly  explain  who  owns  and  how  to  use  the  data.  “Definition  criteria”  for  data 
ownership is introduced  by Manner et al. (2013). They spotlighted the fact that access to the data in 
platform ecosystems by participants is increasing. Their concern, however, is less focused on  how to 
share the results of monitoring, conformance and data ownership definition.  

Discussion  

By  looking  at  the  results,  all  existing  frameworks  and  previous  studies  have  disregarded  data 
providers’  contribution.  Moreover,  access  rights  issues  based  on  user’s  contribution  are  also  mostly 
neglected.  The  importance  of  data  provenance  is  also  not  addressed  in  most  frameworks.  A  limited 
number  of  frameworks  or  studies  have  an  interest  in  data  flow  management.  A  majority  of 
frameworks  focus  on  how  to  control  platforms  through  conformance  and  monitoring  mechanisms. 
The studies overlook the importance of visibility of a data supply chain.  

To  sum  up,  there  are  some  critical  points  which  should  be  strengthened  in  existing  governance 
models:  (1)  how  to  achieve  visibility  and  traceability  of  a  platform  ecosystem,  (2)  how  to  combine 
traditional RACI method and access rights of data contributors, and (3) how to measure contribution 
effort of platform users. 

Conclusion and Limitations 

In this paper, we proposed seven data governance factors for platform ecosystems, and presented the 
state of practice through case studies and state of the art to show current gaps and limitations. 

To identify the factors, we reviewed academic literature, and then verified and refined them by using 
industry  frameworks  and  practices.  The  identified  factors  align  with  platform  governance  concepts 
(roles,  revenue  sharing,  control  and  trust)  to  differentiate  from  traditional  data  governance.  In 
addition,  we  focused  on  what  data  governance  domains  are  currently  an  issue.  Data  ownership  and 
access rights of platform users are not clearly defined. In particular, non-user content is overlooked. 
Moreover,  there  is  lack  of  mechanisms  to  support  visibility  of  data  flow.  Data  contributor’s  effort  is 
also  not  addressed  in  any  existing  governance  frameworks  and  industry  practices.  The  case  studies 
were  conducted  by  surveying  the  policies  of  four  platform  ecosystems  to  show  how  the  platforms 
document  data  governance  practices.  We  then  showed  the  gaps  and  limitations  of  19  industry  and 
research governance models by comparing these with our data governance factors.  

Future research is planned to study efficient and effective ways of implementing the suggested factors. 
To  do  so,  we  need  to  overcome  several  limitations  that  remain  in  this  study.  First  of  all,  our  data 
governance  factors  need  to  be  analyzed  based  on  different  views  (e.g.  platform  owners  vs  platform

users)  in  practice.  Secondly,  our  case  studies  have  possible  validity  issues.  The  case  studies  were 
carried  out  and  assessed  by  one  author,  and  limited  data  sources  were  used.  We  need  to  consider 
validation of our observations, and multiple data sources for analysis. In addition, we need to choose 
various  types  of  platform  ecosystems  such  as  C2C,  B2C  or  B2B  platforms  to  improve  diversity  of 
sampling,  and  to  strengthen  external  validity  and  generalization.  Lastly,  our  literature  search  might 
not include all relevant studies. We need to expand the search boundary to include more literature by 
using a complete SLR approach.
