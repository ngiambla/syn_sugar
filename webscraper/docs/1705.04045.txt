ABSTRACT
Every day, millions of users reveal their interests on Facebook,
which are then monetized via targeted advertisement marketing
campaigns. In this paper, we explore the use of demographically rich
Facebook Ads audience estimates for tracking non-communicable
diseases around the world. Across 47 countries, we compute the au-
diences of marker interests, and evaluate their potential in tracking
health conditions associated with tobacco use, obesity, and diabetes,
compared to the performance of placebo interests. Despite its huge
potential, we (cid:128)nd that, for modeling prevalence of health conditions
across countries, di(cid:130)erences in these interest audiences are only
weakly indicative of the corresponding prevalence rates. Within
the countries, however, our approach provides interesting insights
on trends of health awareness across demographic groups. Finally,
we provide a temporal error analysis to expose the potential pitfalls
of using Facebook’s Marketing API as a black box.

1 INTRODUCTION
Despite recent media a(cid:138)ention on epidemics such as Ebola and
Zika, globally, the two most common “killers” are ischemic heart
disease and stroke1 followed by a set of lung health conditions.
(cid:140)ough not as photogenic as Ebola or Zika, lifestyle diseases are
in fact far bigger burdens on the global health system than AIDS,
in(cid:131)uenza and malaria combined.

Addressing the challenges imposed by lifestyle diseases (cid:128)rst re-
quires an adequate surveillance system, which not only tracks
prevalence rates but also people’s awareness of them. Especially for

preventable lifestyle diseases, such awareness is required to induce
behavior change.

Recently, encouraging studies linked what people like on Face-
book to behavioral aspects and interests in various health condi-
tions [2, 4, 5, 7, 9, 18]. (cid:140)ese e(cid:130)orts suggest that Facebook data and,
particularly, the Facebook advertising system could be a valuable
source of behavioral and demographic information, which is key
for lifestyle disease surveillance.

Concretely, Facebook provides its advertisers with access to its
users through its targeted advertising platform. Before an ad is
launched, and before any cost is incurred, advertisers are provided
with an estimate of how many users match the speci(cid:128)ed criteria,
which can include age, gender, sets of interests, speci(cid:128)c locations,
and much more.

(cid:140)is type of “digital census” opens new avenues for research in
public health for several reasons. First, the popularity of Facebook
“Likes” makes them a promising data source for tracking awareness.
Second, the cost of compiling global health statistics such as the
Global Burden of Disease database [14] could be drastically reduced.
(cid:140)ird, the latency of compiling statistics would be reduced, which
could make it feasible to measure the impact of policy changes,
health campaigns or major global events. Lastly, this approach
would allow for an international and cross-lingual analysis by piggy-
backing on Facebook’s NLP pipeline. (cid:140)us, although Facebook Ads
is a proprietary system, it is worth investigating its value as a data
source for lifestyle disease surveillance.

In this paper we investigate the feasibility of using Facebook ad-
vertising audience estimates for global lifestyle disease surveillance
aiming at identifying advantages, disadvantages and limitations
of this approach. In particular, we compare these to global disease
prevalence across 47 countries, as well as across demographics
within the countries. Unlike previous works, we perform quality
checks in the form of estimates of “placebo” interests, as well as
temporal stability of the results. To the best of our knowledge,
Facebook ads audience estimates have not been rigorously tested
for data quality and stability across countries. (cid:140)us, we illustrate
the bene(cid:128)ts and dangers of using social media as a “black box”,
and provide methodological tools for future research of such social
media data aggregators.

2 RELATED WORK
In “Social media in public health” Kass-Hout & Alhinnawi assert,
“Social media can provide timely, relevant, and transparent infor-
mation of public health importance” [10], formulating an exciting
ongoing research to study health trends via online data. Following
this call for action, some researchers focus on information seeking
on topics such as abortion [16] and vaccines [19], others use the

data to now-cast diseases [8], while others use search logs, most
notably using Google Trends, to predict seasonal (cid:131)u [6].

(cid:140)e large errors in (cid:131)u prediction from Google Flu Trends o(cid:130)ered
interesting lessons for the use of this kind of data [12]. While some
e(cid:130)orts a(cid:138)empt to (cid:128)x Google Flu models [15], others have been
dedicated to assessing and evaluating the data quality extracted
from social media [11]. In this line, we aim at investigating if a new
data source can be valuable for health research.

(cid:140)e Facebook advertising API has been studied in terms of deter-
mining a relative value of di(cid:130)erent user demographics and assessing
the overall stability of the advertising market [13, 17]. A few stud-
ies have a(cid:138)empted to link Facebook audience data to behavioral
aspects and interests related to health conditions. Gi(cid:138)elman et al.
convert 37 Facebook interest categories to nine factors to use in the
modeling of life expectancy [7]. Although they show an improve-
ment in the statistical models, their approach avoided determining
relationships between each individual category with the real-world
data. On the other hand, Chunara et al. explore the relationship of
two factors – interest in television and outdoor activities – to the
obesity rates in metros across the USA and neighborhoods within
New York City [4]. Both of these studies are con(cid:128)ned to the United
States, and are limited to one health topic. In contrast, our study
expands the set of real-world health indicators we track, as well
as the geographic coverage to global proportions. Crucially, we as-
sess the quality of Facebook data by introducing placebo baselines,
normalization alternatives, and performing temporal analysis.

3 FACEBOOK MARKETING API
Facebook, as all large online social networks, relies on advertise-
ment for its revenue. To maximize this revenue it provides advertis-
ers with tools for highly targeted advertising. Before launching the
ad, and before any cost is incurred, the advertiser is provided with
an audience estimate of the number of monthly active users likely
to match the criteria.2 Facebook provides these so-called “reach
estimates” via its marketing API.3 (cid:140)e available targeting options
are truly impressive and, except certain US-speci(cid:128)c information
related to political leaning or ethnic a(cid:129)nity, are all available in
197 countries worldwide. It is important to highlight that Facebook
gathers these estimations based on information from sites other
than just facebook.com, as long as those sites have a Facebook Like
or share functionality4.

For our analysis, we make use of basic user-provided demo-
graphics such as age and gender, and also a set of inferred interests.
According to Facebook, “Interest may include things people share
on their Timelines, apps they use, ads they click, Pages they like and
other activities on and o(cid:130) of Facebook and Instagram 5. Interests
may also factor in demographics such as age, gender and location.”6.
Finally, to automated the data collection, we build a generic python
package able to collect data from Facebook Ads 7.

4 EXPERIMENTAL SETUP
Below we describe how we obtain (i) “ground truth” health data, as
well as (ii) a set of Facebook-derived features used in our model.
Selection of Health Concerns. To have a well-de(cid:128)ned scope,
we limit our analysis to three common health concerns: (i) diabetes,
(ii) smoking, and (iii) obesity. For all of these, one would expect to
(cid:128)nd some signal on social media. Furthermore, they cover a mix
of one disease (diabetes), one health condition (obesity), and one
health-risk behavior (smoking). For each, we obtain the prevalence
data from the World Health Organization. For diabetes, we use the
raised fasting blood glucose statistic for adults (18+)8; for smoking,
the adult age-standardized prevalence of smoking of any tobacco
product9; and for obesity, the age-standardized obesity estimates
statistic, where obese is de(cid:128)ned as having a body mass index ≥
3010.

Selection of Countries. In order to avoid sparsity issues, we
perform our analysis for all countries with more than 5 million ac-
tive Facebook users, as reported by the API. A(cid:137)er removing Taiwan
due absence of information in the WHO reports, this resulted in 47
countries, including 12 from Europe, 17 from Asia, 7 from South
America, 7 from Africa, 3 from North America, and one in Oceania.
Facebook Marker Interests. We de(cid:128)ne a set of marker inter-
ests via a bootstrapping approach. We begin with the most obvious
interests such as “Obesity awareness” for modeling obesity preva-
lence, and consider other related interests suggested by Facebook
Ads explorer11. We then add to the list those interests which have at
least hundreds of thousands in potential audience worldwide. Note
that it is not our intention in this paper to de(cid:128)ne an exhaustive list
of Facebook interests related to each health concern, but to start
with those with the most plausible direct link to the health concern
for this study. (cid:140)e (cid:128)nal list of interests can be found in Table 1.
(cid:140)ese interests include both those denoting awareness of an illness
(such as lung cancer awareness), as well as associated behaviors
(Hookah), and intervention e(cid:130)orts (smoking cessation).

Placebo Interests. As latent factors such as socioeconomic
status or demographic variables could a(cid:130)ect both national health
statistics and Facebook interests, correlations themselves might be
spurious and not necessarily indicative of any meaningful relation-
ship. To be(cid:138)er weed out spurious correlations, we select a set of
placebo interests, which are interests on Facebook that should
not have an obvious causal link with a given condition, but that
might still turn out to be correlated due to latent factors. For this, we
use generic interests, including Facebook, as well as an OR query of
Reading OR Entertainment OR Technology. We also add two health-
oriented interests, Health Care and Fitness & Wellness, to serve as
indicators for whether we are picking up (i) interest speci(cid:128)c to a
health concern, or (ii) generic interest in health topics. Note that
providing a “placebo” in such analyses is new, with previous works
using Facebook Ads data more as a black box, without determining
the merit of using particular marker interests over a baseline [4, 7].
Demographic Variables. Prior work [1] found that the perfor-
mance for social media based now-casting depends on the subset of
users that are being considered. To explore if more (cid:128)ne-grained data

User Base Normalization. At a high level, we are interested in
(cid:128)nding whether the fraction of Facebook users in a given country
with a particular interest is indicative of a health concern’s preva-
lence in that country. Whether or not a given user has a particular
interest is strongly confounded by the time they spent online in
general and on Facebook in particular. A random surfer, randomly
clicking and liking pages for hours on end, would end up with
more inferred health related interests than a user logging in once
a month to receive updates from a diabetes forum. In an e(cid:130)ort to
correct for this, without being able to access the user-level data, we
experimented with di(cid:130)erent normalizers, including Health Care and
generic topics of Reading OR Entertainment OR Technology. Subset-
ting to a more speci(cid:128)c user set should, in theory, partially remove
the confounding e(cid:130)ect of di(cid:130)erent activity levels. Although we
found the results to be somewhat di(cid:130)erent, there was li(cid:138)le cohesive
trend between data normalized using these specialized populations
and one using the Facebook population. (cid:140)us, we leave a more
detailed study of this issue for future work.

5 MODELING PREVALENCE
Using the above design, we collected the data on October 19, 2016.
Overall, 583,200 requests to the Facebook Marketing API were
required, and the collected data is available for the community.13.
We begin by computing Pearson correlation r of normalized
Facebook audience estimates with the corresponding WHO data
for each health concern. We (cid:128)nd that just two – the interest Dieting
with (r = 0.314) and the OR query “Obesity awareness OR Plus-size
clothing OR Weight loss OR Dieting OR Bariatrics” (r = 0.344) – have
a signi(cid:128)cant correlation to WHO obesity reports. However, we (cid:128)nd
the placebo interests too o(cid:137)en outperform the targeted marker
interests. (cid:140)e strongest signi(cid:128)cant correlations we (cid:128)nd are between
Fitness & Wellness and obesity (r = 0.590), and Health care and Face-
book and diabetes (r = 0.313 and r = 0.302, respectively). Note that
with Bonferroni correction for multiple hypothesis testing, even
these results may be questioned. (cid:140)e results do not improve when
we break down the data by the age and gender group (plots omi(cid:138)ed
for brevity). Finally, we would like to emphasize the performance
of the baseline, generic health interests, o(cid:137)en “outperforming” the
targeted marker interests. Even the generic placebo interests like
Facebook and Read./Tech./Ent. are o(cid:137)en near the top of the list of
predictors.

We then turn to comparisons within each country, across gender
and age groups. Concretely, we are interested in whether there are
certain generalizable age or gender related trends concerning the
variation of interest levels in health topics within a country. To
obtain such relative trends, we (cid:128)rst compute the absolute inter-
est levels for the relevant demographic group. (cid:140)en we normalize
these statistics within each country by computing the z-score (sub-
tracting the mean and dividing by standard deviation across the
demographic groups).

Figure 1 shows the average z-scores of (a) placebo interests, and
marker interests for (b) tobacco, (c) obesity, and (d) diabetes, broken
down by gender. We (cid:128)nd the placebo interests to be expressed
more by women than men, especially those dealing with (cid:128)tness
and health. One potential explanation for this is that women are
generally more active on social media than men, in particular on
mobile devices14. Yet we also (cid:128)nd that women show more interest
in topics around obesity and diabetes, though it is expected that,
for example, Gestational diabetes would be a more popular topic
for women than men. We see the opposite for the topics associated
with tobacco, with most topics being more favored by men. (cid:140)e
only exception is Lung cancer awareness, which is, again, a topic
associated with health. (cid:140)ese (cid:128)ndings echo the global statistics of
tobacco use, with WHO estimating that “about 40% of men smoke
as compared with nearly 9% of women”15.

Figure 2 shows the similar average z-scores for various age
groups. Examining tobacco-related interest, we (cid:128)nd the younger
users being more interested in hookah, tobacco, and cigare(cid:136)es, whereas
the older users in lung cancer awareness and smoking cessation. (cid:140)e
users in the age between 30 and 45 do not show preference for one
or the other interest. Comparing these (cid:128)gures to the WHO global

nature, allowing researchers a dimension in which to experiment
with various time lags [15]. Similarly, we re-collect the data for the
10 countries with largest Facebook audiences nearly (cid:128)ve months
later, on 12 March, 2017, to examine its stability. (cid:140)en, we compute
the correlations between the previous and new audience estimates.
When we consider the audience sizes in each country without
constraint by interest, sliced across the age (8) or gender (2) de-
mographic groups, we (cid:128)nd the data quite stable, with Spearman
rank correlation being 1 for most (in two cases 0.99), and Pearson
on average at 0.999. Although there were changes, on average the
estimates increased by 14% (stdev of 8.9%), which may be due to
Facebook’s growing usage or increased user tracking reach.

Once we include the distinction by interest (both marker and
placebo ones), the correlation between the data from October 2016
and March 2017 degrades. Across each country and interest (N =
10 countries * 29 interests = 290), we run two stability checks, (cid:128)rst
for both genders combined we compare the relative audiences for
di(cid:130)erent age groups between the two time samples; second, for
all combined ages we compare the audiences for the two genders
between the two time samples.

observe that the reported evolution of tobacco use by age-groups
follows the z-score trend of related interests from Facebook Ads.
(cid:140)us, we (cid:128)nd that within-country statistics are more statistically
separable, which can then be compared to a corresponding “gold
standard”. Next we focus on error analysis.

6 ERROR ANALYSIS
(cid:140)e greatest advantage of Facebook advertising platform is also
its weakness – the extensive natural language processing (NLP)
pipeline and an aggregator spanning over a billion of users and
many Facebook properties. To us, this black box provides an aggre-
gation on planetary scale, but it also presents a murky opacity.

As mentioned in Related Work, a similar di(cid:129)culty faced re-
searchers using Google Trends, which aggregates search volume
worldwide, and which potentially can serve as a signal of Google
users’ interests. A major advantage of Google Trends is its temporal

gets under 0.05 level), and 17% even negative, meaning the ordering
of the age groups (cid:131)ipped. (cid:140)e gender, being a binary variable, can
only be observed to retain or switch their ordering, and for 13% of
cases the la(cid:138)er happened.

WebSci’17, 2017, Troy, NY

Moreover, to understand the reasons of such di(cid:130)erences between
the two samples we asked the following question: Are the interests
with lower audiences more volatile? In order to respond this ques-
tion, we correlated the mean of the Spearman correlations given age
group for each mark interest and their average audience among all
countries. As result, we came with a negative Pearson correlation
of -0.57 (p-value 0.001). (cid:140)us, surprisingly, interests with higher
audience are more unstable.

Intuitively, if Facebook changes its black box o(cid:137)en (for example,
rede(cid:128)ning the interests), then wild (cid:131)uctuations may happen. But
if the changes re(cid:131)ect the actual changes in user base and their
evolving interests, then the changes should be similar in places
with similar culture, geography, and language. For example, Google
Trends shows dieting spikes at the beginning of each year17.

Hence, we compare the changes in interest from one sample to
another between United States and United Kingdom (two Western
countries sharing a language), and between US and India and Brazil.
To do this, we calculated the correlation between the audience
variation (the deltas) of one country to another country for each
interest. For US vs. UK comparison, out of 29 interests, we found 17
to be signi(cid:128)cantly similar (having Pearson r > 0 at p < 0.05) and
only one interest to be signi(cid:128)cantly negatively related between the
two countries, implying a similarity in the direction of change over
time. For US vs. India, however, only 5 interests shared a direction
(1 negatively), and US vs. Brazil 9 (3 negatively). (cid:140)is suggests that
comparisons between more similar countries may be more stable
in the same time span.

(cid:140)us, upon a closer inspection we (cid:128)nd more stability in the data
across demographics without including interests. (cid:140)is may be due to
the de(cid:128)nition of such features to be stable in time, and possibly to
Facebook’s inference algorithms for age and gender being relying
on more explicit user-speci(cid:128)ed information. However once we
include interest information, the stability of the audience estimates
is much worse, with only 45% of the interest-speci(cid:128)c age groups
having the same ordering (Spearman’s ρ > 0.7).

7 CONCLUDING DISCUSSION
(cid:140)is paper explores the use of Facebook ad audience estimates
for global lifestyle health concern surveillance. Particularly, we
assess the quality of Facebook data by introducing placebo base-
lines, normalization alternatives, and performing temporal analysis.
Among our (cid:128)ndings, we show that within-country statistics are
more statistically separable than statistics across countries, which
is an important observation as previous e(cid:130)orts have showed very
promising results, but they focused only on a single country anal-
ysis [4, 7]. More important, the high volatility observed between
two data snapshots warrants extra caution in the use of Facebook
Marketing API as a source of social interest.

We can only speculate about the causes of such instability. It
is possible that Facebook is constantly updating and changing its
NLP pipeline, unevenly improving its performance over di(cid:130)erent
topics. Further, if the time span implied in the interest estimate is
short-term, audience numbers may swing wildly as Facebook usage
changes, say, during holiday seasons. Another source of variability
could come from the rede(cid:128)nition of what content is included in

17h(cid:138)ps://trends.google.com/trends/explore?q=diet

an interest. For instance, if new brands are included in plus-size
clothing interest, its volume will increase. Finally, the advertising
market demand may drive Facebook to focus on developing one
interest over another.

Still, it may be too early to give up on this potentially rich data
source. Our e(cid:130)ort is restricted to a speci(cid:128)c kind of disease surveil-
lance. (cid:140)us, we acknowledge that it is impossible to generalize
the limitations we have found without future studies. For exam-
ple, much as the search volume revealed by Google Trends [3],
the sways in Facebook’s interests may be seasonal or local. Un-
fortunately currently neither Facebook’s Advertising interface or
Marketing API provide historical data, so more work needs to be
done to monitor the data – i.e. for over a year if one is to capture
seasonal variation. Furthermore, to assess the accuracy of interest
assignment, one could use the advertising platform to run a survey
assessing the interests of the reached audience directly.

(cid:140)us, we hope that this work will encourage future e(cid:130)orts to use
our methodology to gather user interest from the Facebook Ads
for other applications and scenarios. We also hope that results pre-
sented here will encourage future researchers to test the reliability
of this potentially rich data source, and inspire more rigor in the
future data-driven studies that aim at correlating social media data
with o(cid:132)ine world data.
