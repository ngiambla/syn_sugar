Abstract: Impervious surface area is a direct consequence of the urbanization, which 

also plays an important role in urban planning and environmental management. With 

the  rapidly  technical  development  of  remote  sensing,  monitoring  urban  impervious 

surface via high spatial resolution (HSR) images has attracted unprecedented attention 

recently.  Traditional  multi-classes  models  are  inefficient  for  impervious  surface 

extraction because it requires labeling all  needed and unneeded classes that occur in 

the  image  exhaustively.  Therefore,  we  need  to  find  a  reliable  one-class  model  to 

classify one specific land cover type without labeling other classes. In this study, we 

investigate  several  one-class  classifiers,  such  as  Presence  and  Background  Learning   

(PBL),  Positive  Unlabeled  Learning  (PUL),  OCSVM,  BSVM  and  MAXENT,  to 

extract urban impervious surface area using high spatial resolution imagery of GF-1, 

China’s  new  generation  of  high  spatial  remote  sensing  satellite,  and  evaluate  the 

classification  accuracy  based  on  artificial  interpretation  results.  Compared  to 

traditional multi-classes classifiers (ANN and SVM), the experimental results indicate 

that  PBL  and  PUL  provide  higher  classification  accuracy,  which  is  similar  to  the 

accuracy provided by ANN model. Meanwhile, PBL and PUL outperforms OCSVM, 

BSVM,  MAXENT  and  SVM  models.  Hence,  the  one-class  classifiers  only  need  a 

small  set  of  specific  samples  to  train  models  without  losing  predictive  accuracy, 

which  is  supposed  to  gain  more  attention  on  urban  impervious  surface  extraction  or 

other one specific land cover type.

1.  Introduction 

 

 

Impervious surface is a manufactured featured area where water cannot infiltrate 

into the soil, such as sidewalks, roads, driveways, parking lots, rooftops, and so on. In 

recent  years,  urban  impervious  surface  has  emerged  as  not  only  an  indicator  of  the 

degree of urbanization, but also a major indicator of environmental quality (Arnold Jr 

and  Gibbons  1996,  Hong  et  al.  2014,  Weng  2012).  Therefore,  it  is  of  great 

significance to estimate and extract urban impervious  surface areas in the researches 

of global climate change and human-environment interactions (Fan et al. 2013, Ma et 

al. 2014). In one word, the urban impervious surface area plays an important role in 

many urban issues, including  environment  management  (Phinn  et  al. 2002, Weng et 

al. 2011), ecosystem analyses (Ridd 1995), urban planning (Lu and Weng 2006) and 

so on. Naturally, it is not strange that so many researchers have paid more concerns on 

impervious  surface  extraction  (Deng  et  al.  2012,  Deng  and  Wu  2013,  Fan  et  al.  2013,  Fan 

2013, Fan and Deng 2014, Hong et al. 2013, Hong et al. 2014, Im et al. 2012, Zhang et al. 

2014). 

Remote  sensing  has  been  widely  used  in  extracting  and  mapping  urban 

impervious  surface  area.  A  number  of  methods  used  to  classify  mid-high  resolution 

and high resolution images provide potential opportunities for detecting more-refined 

impervious  surface  information,  including  support  vector  machine  (SVM),  artificial 

neural  network  (ANN),  multiple  logistical  regressions  (MLR)  and  spectral  mixture 

analysis  (SMA)  (Esch  et  al.  2009,  Hu  and  Weng  2009,  Im  et  al.  2012,  Shao  and 

Lunetta 2012, Sun et al. 2011, Wei and Blaschke 2014, Zhang et al. 2012, Zhang et al. 

2014). However, these supervised classification methods need  to label all land types 

in  an image  before training processes. If we use  these multi-classification  models to 

solve  the  one-class  classification  problem,  such  as  impervious  surface  extraction,  it 

will increase classification difficulty and time cost during manually labeling training 

samples, particularly in the case of using large mid-high or high resolution images (Li 

et  al.  2011).  But  the  fact  tells  us  it  is  very  necessary  to  extract  impervious  surface 

information from mid-high or high resolution remote sensing images. 

A  number  of  one-class  models  have  been  developed  to  solve  one-class 

classification  problem  in  the  literature.  In  one-class  classification  models,  the  target 

class and other classes represent the class of interest and outliers respectively, and the 

models  only  need  to  label  some  target  data  (positive  data)  in  training  processes  (Li 

2013). Ratnaparkhi presented a method named Maximum Entropy Model (MAXENT 

or  ME)  (Ratnaparkhi  and  Others  1996),  which  has  been  successfully  applied  in 

estimating  species  geographic  distributions  (Phillips  et  al.  2006)  and  one-class 

classification  of  remote  sensing  imagery  (Li  and  Guo  2010).  The  one-class  support 

vector  machine  (OCSVM)  method  is  another  commonly  used  one-class  classifier, 

 

 

which has shown promise in image classification and ecological niche modeling (Li et 

al.  2010,  Song  et  al.  2008,  Worner  et  al.  2014).  The  biased  support  vector  machine 

(BSVM) (Liu et al. 2003), which is a state-of-the-art learning algorithm often used to 

solve  unbalanced  training  data  problems  (Elkan  and  Noto  2008,  Garg  and 

Sundararajan  2009),  has  been  studied  in  remote  sensing  one-class  classification 

scenarios  (Li  et  al.  2011).  Besides,  Li  and  Guo  have  developed  one-class  models 

named  positive  and  unlabeled  learning  (PUL)  and  positive  and  background  data 

learning  (PBL)  in  succession.  PUL  has  been  proved  to  successfully  obtain  high 

classification  accuracy  of  remote  sensing  images,  and  PBL  has  only  been  used  to 

improve modeling of the geographical distributions of species(Li et al. 2011, Li et al. 

2011).  However,  each  of  the  proposed  one-class  classifiers  has  its  shortcomings. 

MAXENT  has  a  sophisticated  mathematical  model  and  it  may  cause  a  problem  of 

parameters  sensitivity  and  infinite  iterations  which  lead  to  difficulty  in  realizing 

computer  programming  (Curran  and  Clark  2003).  A  drawback  of  SVM  models, 

including  the  traditional  SVM,  OCSVM  and  BSVM,  is  sensitive  to  free  parameters 

that are difficult to tune (Manevitz and Yousef 2002). PBL and PUL are successful in 

ecological  niche  modeling  (Li  et  al.  2011,  Li  et  al.  2011),  which  have  rigorous 

mathematical  models  but  few  studies  introduced  the  algorithm  into  high  spatial 

remote sensing image classification. 

In  this  study,  we  investigate  several  different  one-class  models  (MAXENT, 

OCSVM,  BSVM,  PUL  and  PBL)  and  multi-classes  models  (ANN  and  SVM)  to 

design  several  object-oriented  classification  experiments,  aiming  at  extracting  urban 

impervious surface area from image of GF-1, the China’s new generation high spatial 

resolution  satellite.  Through  assessing  F-score,  overall  accuracy  (OA),  kappa 

coefficient  (

),  user  accuracy  (UA)  and  product  accuracy  (PA)  based  on  confusion 

matrixes  and  artificial  interpolation,  this  paper  presents  horizontal  comparisons  of 

accuracies  among  classification  results  of  these  proposed  classifiers.  The  results 

indicate that PBL and PUL classifiers provide the highest classification accuracy and 

reduce time cost of manually labeling data. They have nearly equal accuracy to ANN 

model, and outperform the OCSVM, BSVM, MAXENT and SVM models. 

 

2.  Methodology 

2.1. Dataset Description 

The  dataset  in  our  experiments  is  a  mid-high  spatial  resolution  (HSR)  remote 

sensing  image  located  in  Guangzhou  with  16  meters  spatial  resolution  and  size  of 

13669*13400  (1.36  GB).It  was  acquired in  2014  by  wide  field  multispectral  camera 

 

 

of GF-1 satellite, the China’s new generation high resolution remote sensing satellite. 

Four  spectral  bands  are  available  in  GF-1  image:  R(630-690nm),  G(520-590nm), 

B(450-520nm),  NIR(770-890nm).  Using  multi-scales  segmentation  method 

to 

segment image by ecognition 9.0, we extract 43,256 homogeneous image objects and 

24  features,  including  spectral,  shape  and  texture  features,  all  of  which  were 

normalized to range [0, 1].   

 

Figure 1: Original remote sensing image and interpretation result. 

As shown in Figure 2, we first classified the image to urban impervious surface 

area and other areas by artificial interpretation. The interpretation result shows 7,574 

objects  were  identified  as  urban  impervious  surface  area.  Based  on  artificial 

interpretation  result,  we  randomly  selected  1,000  objects  of  impervious  surface  area 

as  positive  training  samples,  and  15,000  objects,  including  impervious  surface  areas 

and others, as unlabeled (background) data for one-class classification, while another 

15,000 objects of other areas are selected as negative samples for binary classification. 

The  OCSVM  only  needs  positive  data  for  training,  whereas  PBL,  PUL,  MAXENT 

and  BSVM  require  positive  and  background  data.  As  comparing  group,  binary 

classification models (SVM and ANN) require positive and negative samples as input 

data in training processes.   

In  order  to  obtain  statistically  reliable  accuracy  assessment  results,  the  training 

and  predicting  processes  of  each  one-class  and  binary  classifiers  were  tried  for  ten 

times  using  different  groups  of  training  dataset.  And  the  classification  results  were 

evaluated  by  comparing  with  artificial  interpretation  results  using  F-score,  overall 

accuracy  (OA),  kappa  coefficient  (

),  user  accuracy  (UA)  and  product  accuracy 

(PA) .

In  our  experiments,  we  completed  remote  sensing  segmentation  and  feature 

extraction  by  the  ecognition  9.0,  and  implemented  ANN,  PBL,  PUL,  SVM  models 

(including  OCSVM,  BSVM,  SVM)  by  the  Alglib  2.9  (http://www.alglib.net/)  and 

libSVM  2.89  (http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm/)  packages  and  C++  on 

VS2010  platform.  One-class  MAXENT  results  were  calculated  by  a  free  maximum 

entropy  modeling  software  for  species  geographic  distributions  of  Princeton 

University (http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~schapire/maxent). 

 

2.2. Model Developments 

Positive-Unlabeled  learning  (PUL)  and  positive-background  learning  (PBL) 

were  investigated  by  Li  and  Guo  (Li  et  al.  2011,  Li  et  al.  2011),  which  are  proved 

effective  in  ecological  niche  modeling  using  positive  and  background  dataset.  We 

assumed  that 

  is  denoted  as  environmental  covariates, 

  and 

  are 

denoted  as  true  presence  and  true  absence,  simultaneously 

  and 

  are 

 

x1y0y1s0s 

denoted  as  observed  presence  and  background  data.  And  we  defined  that 

  is  the 

number of observed presence data. Background data contains 

  presence data and 

  absence  data. 

  and 

  are  unknown  during  the  training  process.  Then  we 

define 

  and 

  can be estimated by: 

                                          (1) 

In the equation (1), 

  means observed presences in training dataset. 

  is the 

cardinality  of 

,  and 

  means  presence-background  scenario.  Then  the 

existence probability 

  via PUL and PBL can be estimated by equation (2) 

and equation (3). 

                                          (2) 

                                  (3) 

In  equation  (1)  to  (3),  the  conditional  probability 

  can  be 

estimated  correctly  by  soft  classifiers.  Li  have  proved  that  PUL  integrated  with 

back-propagation  neural  network  (BPNN)  can  estimate  conditional  probability  and 

classifying  image  accurately  (Li  et  al.  2011).  In  this  paper,  we  use  BPNN  of  10 

hidden  layers  implemented  by  Alglib  package  (Bochkanov  and  Bystritsky  2013)  to 

train the PBL and PUL classifiers. Each BPNN classifier has been trained for 5 times 

and then the final prediction values were the average of all outputs so as to increase 

model  reliability.  After  existence  probability 

  was  calculated,  we  set  the 

existence probability threshold of impervious surface area as 0.5(explanation or not?).   

As  comparisons  with  methods  above,  one-class  SVM  (OCSVM)  and  biased 

SVM  (BSVM)  classifiers  have  been  implemented  by  LIBSVM  package  (Chang  and 

Lin  2011,  Guo  et  al.  2008,  Manevitz  and  Yousef  2002,  Song  et  al.  2008).  We 

segmented 25% of the training dataset as the validation dataset. Without negative data, 

F-score  cannot  be  calculated,  and 

  has  been  estimated  as  criteria  of  model 

parameters  calibration.  Two  sensitive  parameters  of  OCSVM  with  RGF  kernel,

,  are  need  to  be  tuned,  and  NU  is  an 

upper  bound  of  the  training  error  rate.  We  set 

  and 

  ,  and 

searched  the  optimum  parameters  by  grid-search  method,  while  the  accuracy  of 

OCSVM model is equaled to 1.0. For the BSVM classification approach, we need to 

tune three parameters: RBF kernel width 

, penalty factors of positive dataset 

 

and  penalty  factor  of  negative  dataset 

.  The  value  of 

, 

  and 

  were 

searched  the  optimal  values  in  the  range  of 

using  grid-searching  method. 

We  trained  the  BSVM  and  tuned  the  model  parameters  using  the  whole  training 

dataset  including  positive  data  and  background  data,  while  OCSVM  only  used  the 

positive dataset. 

In  this  paper,  one  class  MAXENT  software  is  freely  provided  by  Princeton 

University  (www.cs.princeton.edu/~schapire/maxent).  In  order  to  obtain  the  best 

estimation  of  presence  probability,  we  used  the  logistical  output  format  to  train  and 

predict  the  training  data  (positive  and  background  data)..  Free  parameters  and  all 

homogeneous objects, which were the same as the data used in PBL classifiers, were 

set to the default values of software (Li et al. 2011, Phillips et al. 2006). 

In  order  to  estimate  the  effectiveness  of  these  proposed  one-class  methods  in 

accuracy  assessment,  we  calculated  the  F-measure  score  (

),  overall  accuracy 

(OA), kappa coefficient (

), user accuracy (UA) and product accuracy (PA) of each 

experiment based on confusion matrixes through comparing with interpretation image.   

  (proxy of F-measure based on positive–background data) could replace negative 

data  with  background  data  based  on  modified  confusion  matrix  (Li  and  Guo  2014, 

Mack et al. 2014). And 

  is derived as follows (Li and Guo 2014): 

                                            (4) 

If  we  assumed  that

data  respectively,  moreover,

classified negative respectively, then in equation (4),

Table 1 and Figure 3 display the average accuracies of each one-class classifier. 

As shown in Table 1, through comparing the impervious surface area extraction result

highest  F-score, 

,  overall  accuracy  (OA)  and  kappa  coefficient.  And  the 

classification  performance  of  PBL  is  a  little  better  than  PUL.  The  classifiers  using 

MAXENT and OCSVM also achieved good classification results, but the rather large 

omission  error  existed  in  the  result  of  OCSVM,  which  caused  lower  accuracy 

estimation results of OCSVM. However, from figure 3 and figure 4, it is clear to see 

the results of BSVM obtain the worst classification accuracy, which should be due to 

severe commission error produced during the prediction period of BSVM. In general, 

impervious surface extraction using PBL classifier provides the highest average value 

of F-score, 0.7873, with a standard deviation  of 0.0223. The performance of PUL is 

similar  to  PBL.  The  mean  value  and  standard  deviation  of  F-score  are  0.7780  and 

0.0080  respectively.  Whereas  the  average  F-score  value  of  MAXENT,  OCSVM  and 

BSVM are 0.7560, 0.6960 and 0.5121, with standard deviations of 0.0100, 0.0279 and

4.  Discussions 

The  area  and  distribution  patterns  of  urban  impervious  surface  are  particularly 

key  indicators  to  evaluate  urbanization  level  and  the  urban  environment.  Urban 

impervious surface not only has a great effect on climate, ecology and environment of 

inner  cities,  but  also  has  close  connection  with  resident  activities  (Wouters  2014). 

Urban  impervious  surface  area,  which  is  developed  by  human  activities  in  the 

performance of roads, driveways, sidewalks, roof, parking lots and so on,  represents 

diversity,  complexity  and  uncertainty  on  HSR  remote  sensing  images.  Thus,  how  to 

extract  urban  impervious  surface  area  from  high  spatial  resolution  (HSR)  remote 

sensing image accurately and efficiently is a huge challenge and an important problem 

to be solved.   

In  traditional  multi-class  classifiers,  positive  samples  (urban  impervious  area) 

and  negative  samples 

(non-impervious  surface  area)  have 

to  be 

labeled 

simultaneously  when  urban  impervious  surface  area  is  extracted.  But  it  will  cause  a 

series of problems: on one hand, it is a vast workload and waste to label all categories 

on  images,  while  the  researchers  are  always  interested  in  some  special  surface 

features, such as impervious surface area. On the other hand, due to the complexity of 

urban  land  surface,  it  is  difficult  to  label  non-impervious  surface  samples  exactly, 

which will increase the manual selection errors in training dataset and reduce training 

and  classification  accuracies.  Hence,  in  this  research,  we  introduce  one-class 

classification models which do not need negative samples during training processes to 

solve  the  problem  of  urban  impervious  surface  area  extraction  from  complicated 

urban 

land  surface.  These  one-class  classification  models  can  obtain  high 

classification  accuracy  as  well  as  reduce  the  time  cost  of  training  dataset  selection. 

During  the  training  processes,  OCSVM  only  needs  positive  samples,  and  the  other 

one-class  classifiers  (PBL/PUL/MAXENT/BSVM)  need  amounts  of  unlabeled 

background  samples.  The  real  categories  of  background  samples  may  belong  to 

positive  or  negative  samples,  and  it  is  simple  to  select  these  background  samples 

completely at random in the whole of image. 

In our research, we adopted the objects-oriented classification method to extract 

urban impervious surface area from GF-1 WFV image. Compared with the traditional 

pixel-based classification methods, the former method takes a full consideration of the 

structure and texture features of HSR image, and avoids the problem of random noise 

in pixel-level when calculating the average values of the homogeneous image objects 

during the feature extraction processes. It lowers the errors caused by remote sensing 

sensors  especially  in  the  area  of  accurate  requirement  matching  (Zerrouki  and 

 

 

Bouchaffra  2014).  In  addition,  because  of  the  high  spatial  resolution  of  GF-1  WFV 

image, strong heterogeneity of urban impervious surface pixels and the random noises 

in  HSR  remote  sensing  image,  the  urban  impervious  surface  extraction  results  of 

pixel-based  classification  methods  may  contain  severe  pepper  and  salt  noises,  while 

object-oriented  classification  methods  can  avoid  producing  these  noises  and  have  a 

better performance.   

The  PBL  method  is  first  introduced  into  the  classification  scenario  of  HSR 

sensing  image.  In  this  study,  we  employed  the  artificial  neural  network  (ANN) 

classifier  to  estimate  the  existence  probabilities 

  of  urban  impervious 

surface area on HSR image. Then we used a meaningful threshold (0.5 in this paper) 

cutting off the existence probabilities to obtain classification results. The results show 

that  PBL-ANN  method  obtained  the  best  classification  accuracy  of  impervious 

surface area. Classification results of PUL approximate PBL due to the similar model 

framework, which trains a multi-classes classifier using presence-background dataset 

firstly, and then uses the 

  value to correct the errors of the multi-classes classifier 

containing  many  training  errors.  As  seen  from  classification  results,  in  the  case  of 

presence-only  situation,  PBL  is  a  more  appropriate  choice  than  PUL,  especially  for 

the one-class classification problem of HSR images. 

Recent  researches  have  indicated  that  MAXENT  and  OCSVM  can  obtain  high 

classification  accuracy  even  to  90%  when  used  in  one-class  classification  problems 

(Guo  et  al.  2008,  Li  and  Guo  2010).  The  classification  experiment  results  of 

MAXENT  and  OCSVM  reflected  that  the  overall  accuracy  of  urban  impervious 

surface area extraction could reach 91.84% and 91.88%, the kappa coefficient reached 

0.7082  and  0.6494,  and  the  corresponding  F-score  could  reach  0.7560  and  0.6960 

respectively.  This  means  MAXENT  and  OCSVM  can  obtain  high  classification 

accuracy  in  one-class  classification,  but  lower  than  PBL  and  PUL.  However,  during 

the  process  of  implementation,  the  original  mathematical  model  of  MAXENT  has 

amounts  of  iteration  computation  (Malouf  2002),  so  we  used  an  approximate  model 

with less iteration computation, which consumes less time on iterations yet to obtain 

higher accuracy (Figure 5).   

In  this  paper,  we  set  the  Gaussian  radical  basis  function  (RBF)  as  the  center 

kernel  of  SVM,  OCSVM  and  BSVM,  and  tuned  the  sensitivity  parameters  (penalty 

factor 

  and Kernel parameter 

) by particle swarm optimization (PSO), which 

also  costs  lots  of  time  during  the  optimizing  processes  (Figure  5).  And  because 

SVM/OCSVM/BSVM  classifiers  have  the  problem  of  high  sample  sensitivity,  the 

training  time  of  different  training  dataset  varies  widely  (Figure  5).  In  addition, 

 

(1|)PyxcCNU 

OCSVM  only  needs  positive  dataset  to  train  classifier,  and  is  greatly  sensitive  on 

outlier produced by manual samples selection, which leads to decreasing the accuracy 

and repeatability of classification results. Artificial neural network (ANN) were set as 

core classifier of PBL and PUL. As shown in Figure 5, we can see that the PBL and 

PUL had the shortest training time of all one-class classifiers and high fault tolerance 

to error samples, and the consuming time of different training dataset were consistent 

tolerably. 

 

Figure 5: Comparisons of different classifiers using 10 different training datasets. 

Interestingly,  the  classification  accuracy  of  BSVM  was  the  lowest.  BSVM  is  a 

state-of-the-art classifier to solve one class classification problem using positive data 

and unlabeled data. However, it suffers several disadvantages. The first shortcoming 

of  BSVM  is  the  problem  of  high  parameters  sensitively.  Therefore,  we  use  the  PSO 

algorithm  to  find  the  best  parameters  the  same  way  as  SVM  and  OCSVM,  which 

causes problems of inefficient  and instability during the training processes as shown 

in  Figure  5.  In  addition,  Figure  3  and  Figure  4  show  that  BSVM  suffered  a  serious 

problem  of  commission  errors,  and  the  reason  is  that  the  best  usage  scenario  of 

BSVM  is  biased  binary  classification  problem,  meanwhile,  BSVM  classifier  is 

sensitive to the missing data and error samples (Gonzalez-Abril et al. 2014). However, 

when  BSVM  was  used  in  one-class  classification  scenario,  the  background  datasets 

were  selected  randomly,  which  would  contain  an  amount  of  non-negative  samples. 

Training  errors  and  commission  errors  would  occur  during  the  training  and 

classification  processes,  which  would  lead  to  low  accuracy  of  urban  impervious 

surface area extraction using BSVM.   

 

 

 
Figure 6: Accuracy comparisons of impervious surface area extraction with multi-class 

classifiers (ANN & SVM) 

Furthermore,  in  this  study,  we  also  labeled  1,000  positive  samples  and  15,000 

negative samples as the dataset to train traditional binary classifiers, such as SVM and 

ANN,  and  then  evaluate  the  classification  accuracy  with  the  artificial  interpretation. 

Through  comparing  with  the  classification  results  of  one-class  models,  Figure  6 

generally shows that, except for BSVM classifier, the overall classification accuracy 

of  one-class  models  were  slightly  less  than  binary  classifiers,  but  F-score,  OA  and 

kappa  coefficient  of  PBL  and  PUL  were  similar  with  ANN,  even  higher  than  the 

classification  results  of  SVM.  In  recent  researches,  Wanga  and  Ganga  adopted 

spectral  features  and  normalized  difference  impervious  index  (NDII)  to  extract 

impervious  surface  area  from  Landsat  TM  images  of  Nanjing,  and  OA  and  kappa 

reached  91.4%  and  0.8  respectively  (Patel  and  Mukherjee  2015).  Hong  and  Yang 

extracted several linear ground features of Dianchi Lake from QuickBird using OOB 

method  firstly,  and  then  obtained  urban  impervious  surface  area  by  a  fitting  method 

named  CART  to  fit  the  mixed  land  cover  on  Landsat  images.  As  a  result,  the  OA 

reached to 85.6% (Hong et al. 2014). Combining MODIS reflectance, MODIS NDVI 

and  DMSP-OLS  dataset,  Lin  and  Liu  adopted  one-class  MAXENT  algorithm  to 

extract urban land of China, the OA and kappa of which were 81% and 0.62 (Lin et al. 

2014). So far, no research is effective to extract impervious surface areas through own 

spectral  and  texture  features  of  HSR  images  exactly.  However,  the  one-class 

classification  methods,  especially  PBL  and  PUL,  can  obtain  similar  or  higher 

accuracy of impervious surface areas extraction, even under the situation of positive 

 

 

samples  existed  only.  The  one-class  model  accustomed  to  one-class  classification 

problem  can  effectively  save  time  cost  of  manual  samples  selection,  avoid  the 

problems of  parameters sensitivity and  multiple iterations  existing in  MAXENT and 

SVM.  Hence,  it  is  possible  to  extract  urban  impervious  surface  areas  from  HSR 

images exactly and effectively by one-class models. 

In  addition,  our  proposed  one-class  models,  including  PBL  and  PUL,  are 

inherited from the studies of Li and Guo (LiGuo and Elkan 2011c, LiGuo and Elkan 

2011d). Meanwhile, this study has indicated that ANN-based PBL and PUL can obtain 

the highest training and classification accuracy. Moreover, PBL and PUL are flexible 

frameworks  of  one-class  classification  model,  considering  that  any  multi-class 

classifiers  that  can  obtain  the  present  probability  can  implement  PBL  and  PUL. 

However,  this  study  also  has  its  own  limitations  that    a  large  amount  of  samples  is 

needed  during  the  training  processes  of  PBL  and  PUL,  and  we  have  barely  probed 

into urban impervious surface areas extraction, though urban impervious surface area 

have  the  highest complexity  and uncertainty  on HSR remote sensing  images.  Future 

studies will determine the  impact on PBL and PUL with more multi-class classifiers 

and the methods to decrease the sample size of training dataset.More case studies and 

evaluations are required. 

 

5.  Conclusions 

In  this  paper,  we  adopted  several  one-class  models,  such  as  PBL,  PUL, 

MAXENT,  OCSVM  and  BSVM  to  extract  urban  impervious  surface  area  of 

Guangzhou  on  GF-1  WFV  image  and  compared  with  the  results  of  artificial 

interpretation,  multi-class  models  and  previous  researches.  In  general,  one-class 

classification  models  integrating  object-oriented  classification  method  can  extract 

urban  impervious  surface  area  from  HSR  remote  sensing  image  successfully  in  the 

situation of positive samples existed only. Over all the one-class classifiers above, the 

ANN-based  PBL  and  PUL  can  reach  the  optimum  training  efficiency  and  highest 

classification  accuracy,  meanwhile,  the  results  of  PBL  and  PUL  are  similar  with  or 

even  superior  to  the  results  of  multi-class  classifiers.  Hence,  as  a  flexible  one-class 

classification  framework  of  HSR  images,  PBL  and  PUL  reduce  the  time  cost  of 

manual  label  samples  greatly  but  achieve  high  accuracy,  which  provides  great 

research value on extracting special ground features from HSR images effectively and 

precisely. Therefore, we will construct the multi-scales ground features library of HSR 

images in the future work, and carry out research on more case studies of automatic 

extraction  and  precision  validation  of  different  special  ground  features  in  different 

 

 

areas.
