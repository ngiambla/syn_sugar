Abstract: China has encountered serious land loss problems along with urban expansion due 

to rapid urbanization. Without considering complicated spatiotemporal heterogeneity, previous 

studies could not extract urban transition rules at large scale well. This study proposed a 

random forest algorithm (RFA) based cellular automata (CA) model to simulate China’s urban 

expansion and farmland loss in a fine scale from 2000 to 2030. The objectives of this study are 

to 1) mine urban conversion rules in different homogeneous economic development regions, 

and 2) simulate China’s urban expansion process and farmland loss at high spatial resolution 

(30 meters). Firstly, we clustered several homogeneous economic development regions among 

China according to official statistical data. Secondly, we constructed a RFA-based CA model to 

mine complex urban conversion rules and carried out simulation of urban expansion and 

farmland loss at each homo-region. The proposed model was implemented on Tianhe-1 

supercomputer located in Guangzhou, China. The accuracy evaluation demonstrates that the 

simulation result of proposed RFA-based CA model is more in agreement with actual land use 

change. This study proves that the primary factor of farmland loss in China is rapid 

urbanization from 2000, and the farmland loss rate is expected to slow down gradually and will 

stabilize from 2010 to 2030. It shows that China is able to preserve the 1.20 million km 

farmland without crossing the “red line” within the next 20 years, but the situation remains 

severe.

1 Introduction 

 

Human-induced land-cover change, especially urban expansion, is a major threat to natural and 

ecological environment (Liu et al. 2014, Seto et al. 2012, Seto et al. 2012). As the most 

populous country in the world, China is now in a rapid urbanization process and causes many 

serious problems like environmental pollution and farmland loss (Chen et al. 2010, Ding 2003, 

Jiang et al. 2013, Liu et al. 2014, Lu et al. 2015, Tan et al. 2005). According to the National 

Bureau of Statistics, the farmland areas of China have sharply decreased from 1.28 million 

km2in 2000 to 1.22 million km2 in 2010 as a result of rapid urbanization. To achieve 

sustainable development, the Chinese government formulated the "arable-land red line" policy 

to retain no less than 1.20 million km2 (1.8 billion mu) farmland in 2003(Ding 2003, Liu et al. 

2014, Xinhuanet 2012, Xinhuanet 2013). Therefore, precise simulation of urban expansion is 

of great importance to strictly control urban land uses and help develop countermeasures of 

farmland loss. . 

Urban expansion and farmland loss are both very complex geographical processes. Over 

the past two decades, cellular automata (CA) have been widely and successfully applied to the 

simulation of complex geographical phenomena and lots of efforts were made for urban 

transition rule mining (Chen et al. 2008, Cheng and Masser 2002, Li et al. 2011, Li et al. 2013, 

Liu et al. 2008, Liu et al. 2014, White and Engelen 1993). Recently, many studies have 

integrated machine learning (ML) algorithms with CA models to mine urban transition rule, 

including logistical regression, ant colony optimization (ACO), immune algorithms and neural 

networks. (Arsanjani et al. 2013, Chen et al. 2008, Feng et al. 2011, Huang and Gao 2011, Li 

et al. 2013, Li et al. 2013, Li and Yeh 2002, Lin and Li 2015, Liu et al. 2008, Liu et al. 2010, 

4 

 

Liu et al. 2012, Shao et al. 2015, Yang et al. 2012). However, there are some shortcomings of 

these ML algorithms for transition rule mining.    Logistic regression need the input variables 

to be linearly independent (Knol et al. 2012), while generally most spatial variables inputted in 

logistic-based CA model have certain relationship, i.e., cells that are close to the urban center 

are prone to be close to roads; ant colony optimization and immune algorithm have strong 

adaptability and parameter optimization ability, but the total computation efficiency is low and 

easy to fall into the local optimal ; neural network can address the above problem, but the 

internal mechanism of training process is still not clear and easy to be overfitting, and it is also 

time-consuming and hard to parallelize (Hung and Hung 2014). And most of the ML-CA 

models mentioned above were mainly conducted at small scale like a single city. As we known, 

urban expansion is a very complex nonlinear system, which is not only affected by the well-

known factors like the distance to downtown and the terrain, but also the uncertainties like 

governmental policy, population migration and natural disasters (Liu et al. 2012). Therefore, in 

order to equip CA for large-scale nationwide simulation, we need to develop a nonlinear 

method which is high-precision, hard to be over-fitted, easy to parallelize and high-tolerance 

for random variables for mining urban expansion rules. 

Most of the existing CA applications are at city-scale which aim at simulating the urban 

phenomena(He et al. 2015, Liu et al. 2007, Liu et al. 2010, Luo and Wei 2009, Shao et al. 

2015, Wu et al. 2010, Xie et al. 2012, Yang et al. 2012). Li and Yeh indicated that the cities 

with large-scale area have diverse patterns and different processes of land-use changes (Li and 

Gar-On Yeh 2004), so it is unreasonable to only apply a single transition rule for large-scale 

simulation at national level. Some attempts have been made to enhance CA model’s ability for 

5 

 

large-scale simulation. For example, some studies have carried out provincial simulation of 

urban expansion by using case-based reasoning (CBR) and formal concept analysis (FCA) 

coupled with high performance computing technology (Li and Liu 2006, Lin and Li 2015). 

Though high performance computing technology was already used to improve the 

computational efficiency of large-scale CA simulations in this case, however, its performance 

was still unsatisfactory for detailed urban simulation (Li et al. 2010, Li et al. 2012). The 

aforementioned parallel CA models have parallel-unfriendly algorithm for transition rules 

mining and the hardware platforms they used limited the parallel computing performance. (Li 

et al. 2012) Thus, these models are not suitable for detailed geographical simulations in large 

scale (Liu et al. 2014).    In this study, we propose a simulation model which is suitable for 

large-scale detailed simulation and high-performance computing to address these issues. 

In this paper, we designed a RFA-based CA model to simulate China’s urban expansion 

and farmland loss process at resolution of 30 meters. Firstly, we distributed the entire country 

into different homo-regions based on the similarity of socio-economic conditions at the 

provincial level. Then we introduced the random forest algorithm (RFA) to mine China’s urban 

conversion rules in different regions as well as to simulate China’s urban expansion and 

farmland loss from 2000 to 2030. The RFA-based CA model also measured the importance of 

each spatial variable according to its contribution for predicting urban transition probability 

during the training process. Therefore, the simulation results can offer us explanation about the 

driving forces of rapid urbanization in China. The proposed RFA-CA model was implemented 

on Tianhe-1 supercomputer and the ANN-based CA model was also conducted on the same 

computing environment to demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of our proposed 

6 

 

model..   

2 Study area and data 

2.1 Study area 

Our study case was conducted in the whole territory of China (Figure 1), which is about 

9,600,000 km2 and contains 23 provinces, 5 autonomous regions, 4 direct-controlled 

municipalities (Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Chongqing), and 2 mostly self-governing 

special administrative regions (Hong Kong and Macau). China is such one country that feeds 

approximate one-fifth of the human population by less than one-tenth of the earth’s cultivated 

land. A considerable urban expansion has witnessed since 1978 because of the fast economic 

development in this area, which has brought rapid loss of farmland resource (Zhang et al. 

2012).

2.2 Data acquisition and pre-processing 

The vector dataset of China’s administrator border (1:4,000,000), which contains national level 

and provincial level boundaries, was obtained from DIVA-GIS (http://www.diva-gis.org/gdata). 

The border dataset contains 34 polygon features and covers all the provinces and province-

level municipalities in China. Through National Data website of National Bureau of Statistics 

of China (http://data.stats.gov.cn/), we obtained every province’s economy development data, 

including GDP, growth rate of GDP, Per Capita GDP (GDPPC), growth rate of GDPPC, 

proportion of primary industry, proportion of secondary industry, proportion of tertiary 

industry, permanent resident population, total population, etc. Also, the Annual Official Journal 

of China's Ministry of Land and Resources has released a large amount of statistical data from 

1990 to 2014 (http://www.mlr.gov.cn/zwgk/tjxx/), including the area and types of farmland of 

8 

 

each province. In this study, we used data from these two resources to construct economic 

development database for large-scale simulation of urban expansion and farmland loss. 

Land cover data is the most important data in this study. Figure 2 shows China’s Land 

cover from the classifications of Landsat images in 2000 and 2010 at resolution of 30 meters 

(Chen et al. 2015). The land cover data was obtained from Chinese Academy of Surveying and 

Mapping (CASM). According to the land cover classification standards of CASM, land cover 

data are divided into eleven categories (Farmland, forest, grassland, shrub land, wetland, 

waterbodies, tundra, artificial surfaces, bare land, permanent snow and ice, unknown place). In 

order to simplify land use types and better describe the conversion relation between urban 

expansion and farmland loss, we have reclassified these categories into three custom categories 

as urban, non-urban and limited-development area and thus generated the “actual land cover” 

datasets (Urban area: artificial surfaces; non-urban area: farmland, forest, grassland, shrub land 

and bare land; limited-development area: wetland, waterbody, tundra and permanent snow/ice). 

Also nine types of land use conversion relation were generated.

Figure 3 Auxiliary spatial variables in this study: (a) distance to provincial capital cities, (b) distance to 

prefecture-level cities, (c) distance to counties, (d) distance to main railways, (e) distance to main roads, (f) 

distance to other roads, (g) DEM slope (30 meters), (h) coarse population dataset (LandScan) 

Several auxiliary spatial data sets were also applied in this study. The distance to the road 

 

network and important cities are related directly to the level of urbanization, especially in 

developing countries (Poston Jr and Yaukey 2013). Besides, the population is related closely to 

the level of urbanization, which affects the intensity of land development a lot. Figure 3 shows 

the auxiliary spatial variables. The spatial distance data and DEM slope data were derived from 

basic GIS datasets from CASM, and the population data of China was derived from global 

population dataset of The LandScan Global Population Project 

(http://web.ornl.gov/sci/landscan/).   

In this study, we developed a piecewise normalization method for spatial data pre-

processing. As shown below, the mean 

  and standard deviation 

  of the spatial data 

 

were calculated before value 

  were normalized into [0, 1] by employing three-sigma rule 

(Grafarend 2006) (Equations (1) to (4)).

3 Methodology 

The purpose of our study is to extract the nationwide urban conversion rules by using random 

forest algorithm (RFA) integrated CA model and to simulate urban expansion and its impacts 

on the farmland loss. In this study, we took three steps to simulate the farmland loss in every 

homo-region: 1) We clustered provincial-level administrator regions of China into several 

homogeneous regions according to official statistical data of economic development status; 2) 

We developed RFA-based CA model to compute the overall urban conversion probability and 

extract the urban conversion rules in each region; 3) We simulated urban expansion and 

farmland loss based on the urban conversation rules extracted by proposed RFA-based CA 

model, and measured the reliability of our results by comparing with results from ANN-based 

CA models.

3.1 Regional agglomeration 

Considering China’s great differences in geographical resource distribution and complicated 

socio-economic development status, driving forces of land development are quite varied in 

different regions of China.    Besides, due to multi-scale effect, the change in spatial 

distribution is a course of gradual accumulation and one from quantitative to qualitative 

(LAND et al. 1999, Xu et al. 2001). Therefore, by taking multi-scale effect account, our study 

performed regional agglomeration method in units of provinces and provincial level 

municipalities in order to cluster the research area into distinct homogeneous regions for urban 

conversion rules extraction. Through the regional agglomeration, we could obtain more 

suitable homogeneous socio-economic regions for rules-mining; also the parallel computing 

could be applied to these clusters and thus reduced computation time and balanced 

computation resources. 

12 

 

Firstly, the socio-economic indexes of each province were normalized into range [0, 1] by 

minimum-maximum normalization method, including growth rate of GDP, per Capita 

GDP(GDPPC) and growth rate of GDPPC, etc. Then principal component analysis was 

performed on the normalization results. In the next step, the first two components of PCA result 

were put into SPSS to carry out cluster analysis using the centroid clustering method and the 

Pearson correlation for metrics. At last, the non-adjacent homogeneous regions were divided 

into different groups based on socio-economic indexes. 

3.2 CA Model Integrating RFA 

In this section, we will first introduce the method of Random Forest Algorithm (RFA) and then 

deploy it to construct our urban development model. The mathematical foundation of Random 

Forest Algorithm can be found in the work of Breiman (Breiman 2001).   

3.2.1  Random Forest Algorithms (RFA) 

RFA is a multi-classifier combination model that comprises a large number of decision trees

. Specifically, the parameter set 

  of each decision tree consists of 

mutual independent random variables with the same distribution. RFA assumes the existence of 

  classification categories 

  and randomly draws 

  samples from the 

original training dataset to build 

  decision tree classifiers. The size of each random sample 

is the same as that of the original training dataset. Each decision tree classifier will yield a 

classification result when the independent variable 

  is given, which stands for one vote for 

the final classification result. Therefore, 

  classification results will be separately obtained 

after the unclassified data 

  being inputted to 

  decision tree classifiers. By taking each 

13 

(,),1,...,khXkMkN,1,2...iYiNMMXMM 

tree’s classification result as one vote, we can calculate the probabilities 

  of 

unclassified data 

  falling into each category

, where

. 

By selecting the features of each sample, RFA can generate different training sub-datasets 

to increase the diversity between classifiers, so as to minimize the potential for over-fitting 

during the training process and improve predictive ability. RFA is a multi-classifier 

combination system generated by training decision tree classifiers

. Equation (5) measures 

the probability for unclassified data 

  falling into each category and Equation (6) generates 

the final classification result (Biau 2012, Breiman 2001). 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(5)   

(6) 

Specifically, 

  is the result of the multi-classifier combination model, 

  is the 

result of the single decision tree, 

  is the classification result of the single tree, and 

 

denotes the indicator function. Equations (5) and (6) illustrate that the classification result of 

RFA is based on a majority voting rule. 

Furthermore, RFA is more than an assembly of decision tree classifiers. Previous study 

has indicated that 37% of the samples in original dataset 

  will not be extracted and will be 

classified as out-of-bag (OOB) data (Biau 2012). Using OOB data to estimate the performance 

and accuracy of the RFA classification model is referred to as OOB-estimation. We can obtain 

an error report of OOB-estimation for each decision tree. The generalization error of RFA can 

be calculated by averaging the errors of the decision trees via OOB-estimation.   

In our study, we implemented RFA classifier by using the Alglib package

(http://www.alglib.net/ ).In order to obtain the contribution of each type of spatial variable, the 

random noises are added into the spatial variables of 

type during the training process 

(

,

  is the types count of spatial variables), and thus we can obtain the error of RFA 

classifier

.    Assumed that 

  is the predict average error of original training dataset 

by using 

  error RFA classifier 

  , and 

  is the predicted average error of 

original training dataset by using the correct RFA classifier 

, then the contribution 

value of 

  type of spatial variables can be obtained by Equations (7) as follows(Fakhraei 

et al. 2014, Palczewska et al. 2014).

3.2.2  RFA-Based CA model 

RFA integrated CA model is developed to simulate and predict urban expansion and farmland 

loss at large-scale in this section. As shown in Figure 5, our RFA-based CA model involves two 

parts: training and simulating processes. The objective of training process is to mine the urban 

conversion probability of each region, and the simulating process is to predict the urban 

expansion and farmland loss of each region.

The overall development probability, neighborhood effective probability, and random 

probability are multiplied altogether in CA model to obtain the urban conversion probability. In

  (8) 

The overall development probability is calculated by constructing the combination 

classifiers of RFA. We randomly select 

  points from land conversion data to build a 

training dataset 

  of equation (9) after data being pre-processed.

                                            (9) 

The land use conversion types are unevenly distributed in the land conversion dataset. So 

when we collect several random point sets with the same number in each land conversion type, 

the dataset would be repeatedly swept, that left the collecting process redundant and inefficient. 

Moreover, when directly collecting random points from the entire dataset, the proportion of 

some important land use conversion types will become very small and thus result in over-

fitting problem during the training process. Therefore, we used a random sampling method to 

improve efficiency and to balance the quantity of samples in different conversion types. The 

training dataset is built as follows: 

The number of random points in each line is determined by the size of the land conversion 

data: 

. 

The percentage of each land use conversion type in each line is calculated as 

，

  if 

, 

, and 

  (

，   is the threshold of the maximum percentage of sampling). 

The number of random points that are selected from each land use conversion type is 

calculated as 

. These randomly selected points are then joined into the 

training dataset 

. 

The method randomly selects 

  cases from above training dataset 

  and will repeats 

the random sampling 

  times for building the combination classification model 

  of RFA. According to our land use data, the probability of unclassified

data 

that falls into each land conversion type is computed as follows:

  can be 

computed as follows: 

    

 

 

 

(12) 

Whether a non-urban cell 

  converts into an urban one is affected by its neighbor. It is 

obviously that when the surrounding neighbors of cell 

  are urban area, this cell will be 

strongly influenced to be converted into urban land. Equations (13) and (14) describe the 

neighbor effective probability 

  of cell 

  that is located at

A stochastic disturbance term is usually incorporated in CA simulation process to generate 

highly reasonable results (White and Engelen 1993). The disturbance can help simulation 

produce more accurate simulated results, which can be found in real urban systems (Li and Yeh

Where 

  is a uniform random variable within the range of 0 to 1 and 

  is a parameter 

for controlling the size of the stochastic perturbation (Li and Yeh 2002). 

3.3 Iterative process 

Proposed RFA–based CA is designed to simulate and predict urban expansion and farmland 

loss. When the urban development probability 

calculated by the iterative equations (8) 

to (21) is larger than the given threshold

, 

  is expected to be converted into an 

urban area in the 

-th iteration. In experiment, the pace of urban expansion can be controlled 

by adjusting the urban development threshold

. When 

  is low, the urban expansion 

simulation process will becomes faster and the result will incorporate more details   

Northam believed that the urbanization process followed an S-shaped curve and urban 

expansion would become stagnant after continually developing a certain amount of time 

(CHEN and ZHOU 2005, Northam 1979). Therefore, according to Northam’s theory, we can 

set the stop time of the RFA based CA model when the urban expansion acceleration reaches a 

certain threshold of number of urban cells. Assuming that the total number of urban cells at 

time 

  is

, the urban expansion rate 

  at time 

  can be calculated as below: 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(16) 

Besides, the RFA-based CA simulation also needs to meet the restriction from the total 

number of urban areas and the maximum iteration time. The CA iterations will not stop if none 

of the above three conditions has been satisfied. We design three fixed thresholds to control the 

convergence condition, which are minimum urban expansion acceleration 

, minimum 

19

total number of urban expansion cells 

, and maximum iteration times 

  respectively. 

The stopping conditions of these parameters are listed as below: for urban expansion 

acceleration 

, for total number of urban expansion 

, and for 

iteration times 

. As soon as one of the above condition is satisfied, the RFA-based CA 

simulation will stop running and produce the final result. 

3.4 Realization and parameter setting 

Our research team realized all algorithms and models proposed in Section 3. Region 

agglomeration was realized on SPSS 9.0, and RFA algorithm was implemented by using C++ 

with Alglib 2.9 (http://www.alglib.net/) packages. Parallel RFA-based CA model was 

implemented on Kylin Linux platform (x64) of Tianhe-1 supercomputer, which is located at the 

National Supercomputing Center in Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China. Several open 

source libraries, such as open-MPI (http://www.open-mpi.org/), GDAL (http://www.gdal.org/), 

openMP (http://www.openmp.org) and libxml2 (http://xmlsoft.org/), were also applied to our 

research applications for simulation.   

In the section regional agglomeration, the minimum-maximum normalization method and 

principal component analysis were used for extracting the principal components of socio-

economic indexes. The top two principal components we chose were reserving 80.04% 

information by conducting PCA, and in the SPSS clustering step, we chose the centroid 

clustering method by setting the clustering level to 6 and adopted Pearson correlation for 

metrics. At last, based on the optimal clustering results, the total 34 provincial-level 

administrator regions were divided into different groups, which yielded 19 homogeneous 

economic development regions in the end.

In the urban conversion rule mining process, we implemented RFA by setting the number 

of decision trees 80 and the percent of training dataset and out-of-bag dataset were set to 0.60 

and 0.40 respectively. The overall conversion probability from non-urban areas to urban areas 

was obtained by RFA-based CA model with the average OOB error of 4.85%.   

During the simulation processes of RFA-based CA models, the iteration number was set to 

100, and total urban growth amount was set to the same as the total changed urban area from 

2000 to 2010. According to official statistical data from 2000 to 2015, Markov chains were 

adopted to predict growing numbers of urban cells (Arsanjani et al. 2013). Besides, we hired 

the urban expansion simulation results of ANN-based CA models to make comparison with our 

simulation results. The ANN-based CA models were implemented on the same platform as 

RFA-based CA models. Because of the random parameters of CA models, the simulation 

processes of all models were repeated 10 times to reduce uncertainties, and its averages were 

considered to make accurate evaluations. Moreover, we selected a statistical measurement 

named “figure of merit” (FoM) to quantify the performance of each CA model. 

4 Results and Discussion 

4.1 Regional agglomeration 

Figure 6 and Table 1 are the results generated by regional agglomeration. As shown in 

Figure 6, all provinces and cities were eventually divided into 19 groups under the criterion of 

similarity degree in economic development status. Table 1 indicates that the results of regional 

agglomeration (homogeneous economic development regions) finely reflect the distribution of 

economic regions in China: Bohai Sea Economic Zone (Region 3), Guanzhong Economic Zone 

21 

 

(Region 6), Chengdu-Chongqing Economic Zone (Region 9), Yangtze River Delta Economic 

Zone (Region 11) and Central China of five provinces (Region 10). In addition, municipality 

cities located within the economic regions are significantly different to the neighboring 

provinces in development patterns, and our result also finely reflects this feature by dividing 

them into different regions (Region 4,5,12,14,etc.).

4.2 Urban conversion rules 

Through the homogeneous economic development regions obtained by regional agglomeration, 

urban conversion rules are able to be mined through the proposed RFA-based CA models. 

Figure 7 and Figure 8 show each variable’s contribution in the process of urban conversion 

rules mining, while the Figure 7 shows the overall contribution weights in national level and 

Figure 8 reflects each spatial variable’s contribution in different homogeneous economic 

regions. 

Figure 7 Overall contribution weights of each spatial variable of China 

 

 

 

 

 

23 

 

Figure 8 Contribution of each spatial variable in different regions 

 

Seen from a national level, the top three influence indexes of urban conversion rules are 

population density, roads density and terrain fluctuation. The ranking of population density 

helps to explain why eastern China got larger development potential than western China, and 

roads density can provide an explanation about the low urban development potential of Inner 

Mongolia, while the factor of DEM slope indicated that terrain fluctuation plays a more 

important role in southern China rather than northern in terms of urban development potential. 

Figure 8 demonstrates that the most important urban development influence factor of the 

provinces in Northern China is population density. The influential contribution of population 

density index reaches higher than 30% in Northeast China, Circum-Bohai Sea economic zone 

and Guanzhong region, and in Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang and Tibet, the population density even 

accounts for over 40% in all the influence factors. Among the provinces in the southwest and 

middle of China where the economic status is underdeveloped, like the five provinces in 

Central China (Hubei, Hunan, Henan, Anhui, Jiangxi) and three provinces in southwest China 

24 

 

(Yunnan, Guizhou, Guangxi), the factor of terrain is as important as population density in 

urban development. However, for the economic developed provinces and municipalities, such 

as Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Jiangsu and Zhejiang, the road density has stronger influence on 

urban development than population density and terrain conditions. 

4.3 Urban Expansion simulation 

Figure 9 shows the simulated urban expansion ratio result of China by every ten years from 

2000 to 2030, and Figure 10 displays the simulation results of urban expansion for four 

selected economic zones in China. Due to the rapid growth of China’s economy in the past two 

decades, China has entered a stage of ‘unplanned urban sprawl’ where the fast urban expansion 

rate can be easily found from the change of urban land ratio between Figure 9(a) and (b). As 

seen from Figure 9, the simulated urban land ratio for 2010, 2020 and 2030 all had a much 

more compact spatial structure than actual urban land ratios derived from CASM land cover 

data for 2000 and 2010. In the perspective of homogeneous economic development regions, we 

can observe that the eastern coast of China (Zhejiang and Fujian provinces) and the western 

China (Sichuan, Chongqing, Guizhou and Yunnan provinces) have the most rapid urban 

expansion speed, which may benefit from eastern coastal area’s rapid economic development 

and government’s “Westward development" policy. While in the North-East China, the 

growing population crisis and the fading transportation infrastructure (such as damage in road 

network system) are supposed to be the primary causes for its lagged pace of urban expansion. 

According to the statistics of urban built-up area acquired from National Bureau of Statistics of 

China, these observed development feature tallies with the official survey nicely.

4.4 Accuracy assessment 

10 

The simulation results also demonstrate that in some cities, the urban area would continue to 

increase while the growth speed would gradually decrease year by year. From 2000 and 2010, 

China entered a stage of rapid urbanization that is no parallel in history, where the ratio of 

urban area had increased by 65% in this decade; from 2010 onwards, the urban growth scale 

began to shrink; by 2030, the pace of urbanization process is expected to reduce and stabilize. 

15 

Besides, urban area has the trend of agglomerating into three mega urban groups with the 

centers located in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou. Table 2 shows the quantitative accuracy 

evaluation of FoM between the RFA-based and ANN-based CA models. It is noteworthy that 

our proposed RFA-based CA model has more correct urban expansion areas and obtain more 

accurate results than ANN-based CA model. The FoM value for the ANN-based model is 

20 

4.82% at the national scale, while FoM value of RFA-based model reaches up to 8.23% with 

70.75% improvement. In some regions, such as Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Sichuan and 

Chongqing, the FoM values of proposed model almost reach 20%. And the simulation results 

of Guangdong province obtain similar accuracy as the previous study on provincial-level urban 

expansion simulation (Lin and Li 2015). 

25 

The FoM values of two models seem a little bit low. Previous studies have pointed out 

that while CA models are applied to large scale regions or regions with small amount of 

observed change, FoM values tend to be relatively low(Lin and Li 2015, Pontius et al. 2008). 

In our case, the simulation scale is rather large, but the observed urban change during the 

period is only 0.42%. Therefore, in this case, the FoM values of this study are still acceptable, 

30 

compared with similar studies (Du et al. 2012, Lin and Li 2015). Through the comparison 

28 

 

between RFA-CA model and ANN-CA model, the FoM values indicate that the RFA-based CA 

model can perform well on simulating the complex urban conversion under a large-scale.

4.5 Farmland loss simulation 

Rapid urbanization in China was at the expense of tremendous amounts of farmland, which 

accounts for most of the farmland loss in China (Ding 2003, Tan et al. 2005). Therefore, the 

predictive urban expansion results of proposed RFA-based CA model can be used to simulate 

the overall farmland loss. Figure 11 displays the simulated farmland proportions at national 

40 

level from 2000 to 2030. We can observe from the simulation result that during the period of 

2000-2010, the erosion amount of farmland caused by the rapid urban expansion accounts for 

more than half of the total erosion amount for the overall 30 years from 2000 to 2030. The 

situation of farmland erosion is even much more serious in the developed eastern coast of 

China. The simulated farmland loss results indicate that the total farmland of China will 

45 

decrease 5.72% from 2000 to 2030 due to the rapid urbanization process, and the annual 

average loss of farmland is about 2,440 km2 per year.    The great loss of farmland poses 

critical challenge to agricultural security and food security. 

31

Figure 12 Comparison between simulated farmland area and actual farmland area. Yellow line shows the 

55 

simulation and prediction results of farmland area change from 2000 to 2030, and blue line shows the actual 

farmland area change from 2000 to 2011. 

In the national second land use survey, the government used a new statistical method to 

 

compute the farmland area, which causes the total farmland area in 2012 to be larger than that 

of the previous land surveys (Xinhuanet 2013). Thus, the statistical arable data of the years of 

60 

2012 and 2013 were not used for accuracy assessment in our study. By comparing the 

simulation results of farmland area with the official statistical data from 2000 to 2011, we 

obtained the results shown in Figure 12. Figure 12 demonstrates that the simulation results of 

farmland area are close to the reality where the standard deviation between the simulations of 

farmland area and the actual farmland areas is 0.02, and the R-squared 

  is 0.87. The 

65 

accuracy results indicate that the rapid urban expansion process is the most important factor of 

farmland loss in China compared with the other factors, such as land degradation, natural 

hazard, climatic variation and ecological change. Compared with the year 2000, 1.28 million 

km2 farmland areas have been rapidly reduced to less than 1.22 million km2 in 2005, and its 

annual reduction rate is as fast as 0.07% in this period. It is only after 2005 that the 

33 

2R 

70 

dangerously rapid loss of farmland was curbed. Since then, the annual farmland loss rate was 

kept restricted within 0.03%. According to the simulation results, China is able to preserve the 

1.20 million km2 farmland from crossing the “arable-land red line” within the next 20 years, 

but the situation remains severe. 

5 Conclusions 

75 

In this study, in order to address the key problems existed in multi-rules digging of urban 

development and data mining under the scenario of national-scale at high spatial resolution, 

firstly we aggregated the provincial-level administrator zones to several homogeneous 

economic development regions by regional agglomeration. Then, a RFA based CA model was 

carried out to obtain urban conversion rules and different spatial variables’ contribution of 

80 

urban development in multi-scale. Finally, proposed RFA-based CA models were used to 

simulate urban expansion and farmland loss processes from 2000 to 2030 in a fine scale of 30 

meters. Compared with the simulation results of ANN based CA models, the accuracy of 

proposed RFA-CA models improved about 70.75%. This study effectively illustrates that the 

essential driver of farmland loss is the rapid urbanization of China. Furthermore, the simulation 

85 

results indicate that in the next 20 years, the farmland loss rate is expected to slow down 

gradually, and the farmland area will stabilize. However, China is still in the stage of rapid 

urban expansion, and considering its high relevance with farmland loss, the future of farmland 

preservation still remains severe. 

Additionally, this study provides a large-scale analytical framework of RFA-based CA 

90 

model for complicated geographical phenomena simulation at high spatial resolution, and can 

34 

 

be utilized at larger scale like global scope in the future. The performance of our proposed 

RFA-based CA model is better than previous CA model for large-scale simulation, and the 

accuracy of RFA-CA model can still be improved under our proposed framework. In future 

studies, System Dynamics and more practical factors will be introduced in patch-based CA 

95 

models to control the microsimulation process and improve the simulation performance based 

on current work.
