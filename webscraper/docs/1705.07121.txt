Abstract-  Advancements 

industry  with  new 
technology and population growth has given rise to security threat 
to our most personal data. The healthcare data management system 
consists  of  records  in  different  formats  such  as  text,  numeric, 
pictures  and  videos  leading  to data  which is  big and  unstructured. 
Also,  hospitals  have  several  branches  at  different  locations 
throughout a country and overseas. In view of these requirements a 
cloud  based  healthcare  management  system  can  be  an  effective 
solution  for  efficient  health  care  data  management.  One  of  the 
major  concerns  of  a  cloud  based  healthcare  system  is  the  security 
aspect.  It  includes  theft  to  identity,  tax  fraudulence,  insurance 
frauds,  medical  frauds  and  defamation  of  high  profile  patients. 
Hence,  a  secure  data  access  and  retrieval  is  needed  in  order  to 
in  health  care 
provide  security  of  critical  medical  records 
management  system.  Biometric  authentication  mechanism 
is 
suitable in this scenario since it overcomes the limitations of token 
theft  and  forgetting  passwords  in  conventional  token  id-password 
mechanism  used  for  providing  security.  It  also  has  high  accuracy 
rate  for  secure  data  access  and retrieval.  In  this  paper  we propose 
BAMHealthCloud  which  is  a  cloud  based  system  for  management 
of  healthcare  data,  it  ensures  security  of  data  through  biometric 
authentication.  It  has  been  developed  after  performing  a  detailed 
case  study  on  healthcare  sector  in  a  developing  country.  Training 
of  the  signature  samples  for  authentication  purpose  has  been 
performed  in  parallel  on  hadoop  MapReduce  framework  using 
Resilient  Backpropagation  neural  network.  From  rigorous 
experiments  it  can  be  concluded  that  it  achieves  a  speedup  of  9x, 
Equal error rate (EER) of 0.12, sensitivity of 0.98 and specificity of 
0.95 as compared to other approaches existing in literature.

hackers.  According  to  a  survey  conducted  by  Ponemon 
institute, 2.32 million Americans have been victims to medical 
data theft [1]. Damages occurring from medical data theft are 
graver  than  other  type  of  thefts,  since  in  other  types  of  thefts 
like credit card or bank ATMs, the bank can be reported of the 
theft  and  immediate  actions  are  taken  but  in  health  data  theft 
fraud  detection  is  rather  tricky  and  slow.  Heath  data  has 
become  a  very  tempting  target  for  frauds  due  to  a  number  of 
reasons.  One  of  the  reasons  being  the  easy  access  to  health 
data  as  compared  to  any  other  kind  of  financial  data  due  to 
lack  of  security  provided  in  storing  the  data.  Further  this 
information  is  used  by  the  thieves  for  creating  fraud  credit 
card accounts and file fake tax returns. This health information 
can  be  misused  to  purchase  drugs  or  medical  equipments 
illegally  or  even  to  claim  false  medical  care.  From  past  two 
years,  the  highest  number  of  hackings  is  suffered  by  health 
industry.  According  to  the  Identity  Theft  Resource  Center,  it 
accounted for 43% of the total data breaches recorded [2]. And 
most  of  the  time  the  victims  are  not  even  aware  of  the  theft. 
Patient’s  privacy  is  first  and  foremost  important  issue  which 
must  be  addressed  while  switching  to  e-healthcare  system. 
Thus, a mechanism is required for proper access and retrieval 
of heath data in a secure manner.  

The  number  of  healthcare  records  is  increasing  at  an 
exponential  rate  and  it  needs  to  be  maintained  in  an  efficient 
manner. Each of the medical record comprises of many pages 
comprising  of  text,  images  and  graphs.    Thus,  each  of  these 
records  is  in  unstructured  and  unencrypted  form.  The  size  of 
these records is therefore becoming so large that the traditional 
systems fail to handle and store it. Furthermore, processing of 
these huge records is an issue. Also, reputed healthcare centers 
have  several  branches  and  there  is  a  need  for  global 
accessibility  of 
records.  Hence,  Cloud 
computing comes up as a viable solution in this scenario with 
added  advantage  of  providing  these  facilities  in  a  scalable, 
flexible  and  robust  manner,  along  with  location  independent 
access.  

their  medical 

Modern  technologies  are  being  integrated 

to  already 
existing  medical  services.  For  example  EMR  (electronic 
medical  records)  and  EHR  (electronic  health  records)  are 
those two technologies that have been adopted by some of the 
medical  healthcare  centers  to  maintain  health  records.  But

these  technologies  are  susceptible  to  security  threats  by 
hackers  and  employees  of  the  center.  Biometrics  based  data 
authentication  provides  an  apt  solution  for  providing  security 
of  health  data  stored  in  cloud.  Biometric  security  can  be 
obtained  from  different  methods  such  as  confidentiality, 
integrity,  non-repudiation  and  authentication  as  shown  in  fig. 
1.  Amongst  which,  authentication  is  a  prime  concern  so  that 
any illegal access can be prohibited, thus we  have focused on 
biometric  authentication  in  this  paper.  There  are  many 
different  biometric  authentication  mechanisms  in  practice  but 
biometric  signatures  are  becoming  more  and  more  popular 
because  of  its  social  acceptability.  Biometric  signatures  are 
different from conventional static signatures as static signature 
verification  is  based  on  just  the  structural  properties  but 
biometric  signature  authentication  takes  into  account  the 
dynamic features of a signature such as velocity, acceleration, 
total  time,  pen  tilt  angles,  pen-ups  and  pen-downs  which 
assures maximum security to the user.  
Therefore,  an  amalgamation  of  biometrics  and  cloud  can  be 
thought of as an elixir for management of e-health records. In 
order  to  speedup  processing  of  data  and  ensure  a  secure,   
scalable storage and management of data cloud computing has 
been  used  in  combination  with  biometric  authentication 
mechanism 
in 
BAMHealthCloud.  It  makes  use  of  parallel  computing 
frameworks  such  as  apache  hadoop[3]  for  carrying  out  the 
authentication of data and artificial neural network for training 
and  processing  of  dynamic  signature  data.  Furthermore, 
priority  has  also  been  taken  into  consideration  for  defining 
various levels of data access in order to safeguard high profile 
clients  against  data  theft  which  can  set  grounds  for  crimes 
such  as  defamation  of  high  profile  patients  through  rumors, 
baseless allegations and falsehood [4]. 
 Thus,  this  paper  proposes  BAMHealthCloud  and  discusses 
various  existing  approaches  for  e-  health  data  and  presents  a 
case  study  about  management  of  health  data  in  a  developing 
country. It suggests BAMHealthCloud as a solution for secure 
data  access,  retrieval  and  management.  It  has  two  modules 
namely  health  data  management  system  and  biometric 
authentication  agent.  Following  are  the  contributions  of  this 
paper:

0.12, sensitivity of 0.98 and specificity of 0.95 which is 
less than the values existing in literature. 

The  rest  of  the  paper  is  organized  as  follows:  section  II 
gives the problem description followed by a survey of recent 
literatures pertaining to health care data in section III. Section 
IV discusses the case study and proposes BAMHealthCloud 
framework  followed  by  section  V  where  authentication  of 
the user’s access to data is elucidated.  Section VI validates 
the  proposed  framework  through  rigorous  experimentations 
which  are  explained  further  by  results.  Finally  the  paper 
concludes with the conclusion in section VII.  

II.  PROBLEM DESCRIPTION 

A.  HealthCare Cloud 

Let HC denote the health care cloud Hc={S, P, D, Sm} where 
S denotes staff i.e. S = {S1, S2, S3, …} where Si is the ith staff 
member  having  access  to  health  data  stored  in  cloud,  Pt 
represents  patients  i.e.  Pt  =  {Pt1,  Pt2, Pt3, …}  where  Pti  is  the 
ith patient  having access to  only his or  her record, D denotes 
data store and Sm security manager. The problem lies in how S 
and  Pt  interact  with  the  entity  D  and  how  access  to  D  is 
restricted by the component Sm. 

B.  Data Management Problem 

Health  data  usually  contains  records  spanning  across 
hundreds  of  GB’s  of  data.  This  data  is  usually  difficult  to 
manage  using  traditional  tools  and  techniques  available  at 
disposal.  Thus,  we  need  a  system  that  can  handle  such  data 
characterized  by  large  volume  and  variety.  In  order  to  meet 
this end the proposed technique uses health data management  
system which has been built over cloud database management 
system architecture [5]. 

C.  Biometric Security management problem 

The data stored at a third party location is prone to intrusive 
attacks,  thus  we  need  a  management  system  to  secure  the 
system  from  such  attacks.  The  two  main  objectives  are  to 
provide  proper  access  to  legitimate  users  and  to  authenticate 
the  users  (patients  and  staffs).  The  authentication  is  provided 
through the biometric authentication agent incorporated in the 
system.  This  agent  also  provides  access  control  to  users,  so 
that  no  outsider  or  attacker  is  able  to  access  the  system  with 
malicious  intentions.  All  the  other  symbols  used  and  their 
explanations is given in table 1. 

III.  LITERATURE SURVEY 

The  healthcare  data  is  growing  at  an  exponential  rate,  the 
sources  being  patient’s  individual  records,  data  from  clinical 
trials,  radiology  images  and  genomics  sequences  data.  It  is 
estimated  that  this  data  will  escalate  to  a  value  of  25,000 
petabyte by 2020 [6]. Virtualization and cloud computing are

technologies 
that  are  gaining  popularity  for  capturing, 
manipulation and storage of data of large volume. Some of the 
data  management  and  processing  platforms  are  Hadoop 
framework  and  Amazon  Corporation  EC2.  Storing  health 
information  in cloud involves its access by a remote desktop, 
PDAs and mobile devices, but the access through such devices 
lead  to  a  security  issue.  The  work  done  in  this  paper  focuses 
on  health  care  data  management  through  cloud  and  hadoop 
distributed  programming  framework.  Furthermore,  biometric 
authentication is used for securing access to this data. 

According  to  NIST  [7]  Cloud  computing  is  defined  as  a 
model of ubiquitous computing  which provides an on demand 
access  to  a  set  of  resources  such  as  network,  services  and 
storage  in  a  flexible  manner.  Some  of  its  benefits  include 
resource  pooling,  rapid  elasticity  and  on  demand  services. 
These  are  the  features  that  have  facilitated  the  use  of  cloud 
computing  in  various  domains  including  healthcare.  Thrust 
areas  of  healthcare  where  cloud  computing  is  becoming 
popular  include  DNA  sequencing    using  hadoop  for  parallel 
execution  of  large  DNA  sequences  without  any  compromise 
on the accuracy [8]. Biomedical information sharing is another 
area  where  cloud  computing 
is  gaining  popularity  for 
investigators to share data and information with each other but 
involves  risks  like  data  loss  and  unauthorized  access  to  data  
[9]. This work makes uses of hadoop for parallel execution in 
order  to  achieve  a  high  speed  up  and  robust  access  to 
resources  along  with  overcoming  the  security  issue  by 
employing an authentication element to it. 

Biometric  system  can  be  used  for  providing  authentication 
in a scenario such as healthcare data storage and retrieval. The 
main  requirement  of  implementing  biometric  in  healthcare 
sector  is  the  need  for  privacy  and  confidentiality  of  patient’s

records. There are some international regulations like HIPAA 
(Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) [10], the 
Australian  Privacy  Principles  Act  and  the  European  Data 
Protection Directive that demand high level of security, access 
control,  and  exchange  of  sensitive  data.  Biometric  based 
technology  provides  a  secured  method  to  perform  access 
control  and  individual  identification  as  compared  to  other 
traditional  technologies.  It  is  very  difficult  to  reproduce 
biometric  features  and  therefore  it  can  be  used  to  easily 
identify an individual. 

In  [11],  authors  have  used  bimodal  approach  for  providing 
security  for  electronic  medical  record,  this  bimodal  approach 
combines  voice  recognition  and  signature  authentication 
technologies.  Multi-biometric  system  integrated  with  cloud 
can also provide  security for healthcare data [12]. The data in 
this case is stored in UBUNTU Enterprise Cloud Eucalyptus 
Database  (UEC).  In  [13]  a  semi  continuous    authentication 
mechanism  has  been  designed  for  authentication  of  a  layered 
health  monitor  framework.  It  is  aimed  at  reducing  misuse  of 
data  stored  in  a  heterogeneous  cloud  system.  It  uses  a  fusion 
of  behavioral  and  physiological  biometric  i.e.  keystroke  and 
face recognition. In BAMHealthCloud, the  behavioral as well 
as the structural characteristics of a person’s signature is taken 
for  performing  authentication.  Furthermore,  signatures  are 
highly socially acceptable means of individual authentication. 
A cloud based approach is used to implement signature based 
authentication  system  in  order  to  decrease  the  running  time, 
and  hence  BAMHealthCloud  achieves  high  accuracy  along 
with high speedup.  

Hence,  we  have  used  signature  biometric  for  security  of 
health  data  stored  in  cloud.  This  is  the  novelty  of  our  paper 
that  we  have  used  behavioral  biometric  technique  like 
signature  which  has  not  been  used  in  the  recent  literature.  It 
provides  minimum  error  rate  and  is  socially  acceptable. 
Integrating  biometric  with  cloud  provides  high  levels  of 
security which is fast, globally accessible, scalable and robust. 
In addition, the health care staffs are using hand  held devices 
such as mobile phones, tablets, PDAs to access the records of 
patients.  Using  signature  biometric  amalgamated  with  cloud 
technology  and  integrated  with  handheld  devices  would  be  a 
foolproof security system for data access and retrieval without 
any extra hardware cost. 

IV.  CASE STUDY: HEALTHCARE CENTER AT CAPITAL CITY OF 

A DEVELOPING COUNTRY  

In  a  developing  country  like  India  with  the  population  mark 
reaching  second  highest  in  the  world.  Health  is  an  issue  of 
prime  concern  as  the  individuals  are  the  nations  building 
itself  has  a  population  of 
forces.  The  capital  city 
approximately  1780 
lakh  [14].  Lakhs  of  patients  visit 
healthcare  centers  and  corresponding  to  each  patient  a  record 
is  maintained.  According  to  department  of  health  and  family 
welfare,  the  department  has  to  cater  to  the  needs  of 
approximately  160  lakh  [15]  people  plus  migratory  and 
floating  population  from  neighboring  states.  With 
the 
evolution  of  digital  era  a  digital  copy  is  kept  and  since  the 
numbers of patients escalate on a daily basis therefore this has 
lead to huge volumes of healthcare records. Therefore, it’s the 
need of the hour to handle such voluminous records.

Fig.2: BAMHealthCloud- Cloud based secure biometric architecture 

  There  have  been  many  cases  reported  in  past  where 
healthcare data theft has been performed by employees such as 
a  husband  and  wife  team  stole  data  of  80  patients  from 
Manhattans  Lenox  Hill  Hospital  worth  more  than  14,00000 
USD. In another incident a  former employee  stole fact  sheets 
of  450  patients  which  can  be  used  for  committing  medical 
fraud, tax fraud and health insurance fraud [16]. 

In  this  case  study,  we  propose  a  cloud  based  solution  for 
handling  such  huge  number  of  records,  the  data  arising  from 
different health care sources is offloaded to a third party cloud 
i.e.  the  proposed  healthcare  cloud  as  shown  by  Fig.  2.  The 
storage  and  retrieval  of  this  data  is  handled  by  the  healthcare 
cloud. The healthcare cloud consists of two components health 
data store and security manager. The health data store is based 
on health data management system and security is handled by 
the  biometric  authentication  agent  on  behalf  of  the  security 
manager.  The  relationship  between  the  different  modules  is 
given  by  Fig.  3.  Health  data  store  and  security  manager  are 
overlapping  entities  which  belongs  to  the  Health  Care  cloud. 
The  data  that  is  to  be  secured  is  stored  in  Health  Data  Store 
and  the  security  manager  uses  biometric  authentication  agent 
for providing the security on cloud. 

A.  Health Data Management System 

This  component  of  the  healthcare  cloud  is  responsible  for 
management  of  patients  report  and  other  information.  It  is 
composed  of  three  layers  namely  client  level,  health  service 

 
Fig. 3. Relationship between modules of BAMHealthCloud 

 

provider  level  and  data  center  level.  The  health  service 
provider  level  is  further  divided  into  administrative  and 
security  level.  Biometric  authentication  agent  acts  at  the 
security  level.  Client  level  provides  an  interaction  interface 
between the cloud data and its users. The security and resource 
provisioning  is  in  turn  handled  by  the  two  components  of 
health  service  provider  level  respectively.  The  data  storage 
and  its  management  is  the  responsibility  of  the  data  center 
level.  Thus, 
is 
responsible  for  overall  management,  storage  and  retrieval  of 
the healthcare data. 

the  Health  Data  Management  System 

B.  Biometric authentication agent 

This  module  uses  biometric  signatures  for  the  purpose  of 
authentication. The dynamic features of a signature is captured 
using  a  digitizing  tablet  which  records  features  like  x,  y 
coordinates,  velocity  of  the  pen,  total  time  taken  to  sign, 
angles  of  pen  while  signing,  number  of  pen  ups  and  pen-
downs,  acceleration  etc.  After  the  signature  is  captured  its 
important  features  are  extracted  and  then  it  is  preprocessed 
and stored as a template. After this phase, this template is used 
for training the data and then these trained networks are stored 
in  cloud.  During  verification  phase,  the  user’s  signature  is 
checked  against  the  stored  database  and  it  is  found  out 
whether the user is genuine or forged. 

 Moreover, another added advantage of this approach is that 
the processing is also done on cloud. This saves on the storage 
and cost along with providing lesser carbon footprints i.e. it’s 
an  energy  efficient  approach  as  it  makes  use  of  mobile  and 
handheld devices like tablets and phones for access purpose.

the data stored on healthcare cloud we use the proposed  
biometric  authentication  technique.  Moreover,  in  order  to 
speedup  the  processing  we  use  parallelized  training  through 
MapReduce  programming  which 
is  based  on  Hadoop 
framework.  Hadoop  is  a  popular  technique  for  parallel 
processing of large scale data on cloud. Furthermore, the use  
mobile phones for authenticating the access to healthcare data 
ensure  that  the  entire  process  is  energy  as  well  as  cost 
efficient. 

The proposed approach is divided into two phases: Phase I-

Enrollment phase and Phase II authentication phase 

A.  Phase I-Enrollment phase 

In this phase, as  shown in Fig.  4, the  staff and the patients 
enrolled  in  the  health  care  centre  are  asked  to  enroll 
themselves  by  giving  their  signature  samples  using  either  the 
signature  capturing  device  or  their  smart  phones  that  are 
installed  with the signature capturing  software.  Once a  user’s 
signature  is  captured,  the  quality  of  the  given  signature  is 
checked  using  SigQuality  checker  software.  The  function  of 
this  software  is  to  ensure  that  the  recorded  signature  samples 
match up to the quality standards required for authentication.  
Once this match is performed, the features of the samples are 
extracted and are stored in the healthcare cloud.

B.  Phase II authentication phase 

In this phase as described in Fig. 5, user is checked for his 
authenticity. The  user is asked to give  his signature,  which is 
sent for quality check and after that, its features are extracted. 
Then, this signature sample is checked against the stored user 
template  in  the  healthcare  cloud.  This  matching  is  performed 
using  resilient  backpropagation  algorithm  in  a  feedforward 

neural  network  (explained  later).  The  matching  process  is 
done in order to find out whether the user is a genuine one or 
not.  This  user  authentication  is  done  in  a  parallelized  way. 
ALGOHealthSecurityCheck  describes  the  approach  adopted  for 
performing  security check on  health data lying in the  healthcare 
cloud. In order to check the level of access provided to a user 
an access hierarchy is defined. This hierarchy is based on the

 priority of the users. This priority value is assigned at the time 
of enrollment on a scale of 1-4, 4 is the highest priority value 
and 1 is the lowest value. The different types of users and their 
respective  priority  values  are  illustrated  further  in  Table.  II. 
Higher the priority value associated  with the  user  more is  the 
level of  security  guaranteed by the  system. This is taken care 
of by associating a threshold value in the training algorithm  
i.e. algorithm 1 that depends upon the priority P. According to 
this  algorithm  authentication  is  performed  based  on  the 
associated  priority  value.  If  a  user  with  low  priority  i.e.  a 
regular  staff  member accesses the data then  its authentication 
performed with its threshold value set to Priority_Low (lines 1-
4). Similarly, the threshold values are set as Priority_Avg,

hardware  across  a  distributed  cluster.  This  speeds  up  the 
processing and is cost effective along with being fault tolerant.

In  step  11,  the  PCA  feature  extraction  is  performed  on  the 
input data. After this, training of dataset is done using resilient 
backpropagation algorithm in a parallelized manner. 
Resilient backpropogation (RPROP) is a popular algorithm for  
backprpogation    training  of  multilayer  feed-forward  neural 
netwoks.  Backpropogation  algorithm  involves  application  of 
chain  rule  repeatedly  to  findout  the  impact  of  each  weight  in 
accordance to error function E [17].

Theorem 1: The time complexity of ALGOHealthSecurityCheck is 

O(L xM). 

Proof:  The  time  complexity  for  performing  security  check 
on health data stored on cloud is O (L x M). It takes O (L x M) 
for  performing  security  check  on  low  priority  users  (line  4, 
ALGORITHM 1) as given in theorem 2. It takes O (L x M) for 
performing  security  check  on  average  priority  users  (line  8, 
ALGORITHM 1). It takes O (L x M) for performing security 
check  on  high  priority  users  (line  12,  ALGORITHM  1)  and 
takes  O  (L  x  M)  for  performing  security  check  on  very  high 
priority users (line 16, ALGORITHM 1).Thus, the complexity 
of ALGOHealthSecurityCheck is maximum (O (L x M), O (L 
x M), O (L x M), O (L x M)) i.e. O (L x M) 

Theorem 2: The time complexity of ALGOHealthAuthentication is 
O (L x M) where L is the number of users and M is the number of 
signature samples corresponding to each user.

(SGD) 
backpropogation becomes increasingly smaller which leads to 
negligible  updates  in  weight  along  with  slow  training  [18] 
[17].  It achieves this by using a fixed update value δij  whose 
value can be increased or decreased with each iteration η+ and 
η-    multiplicativley.  where,  η    is  an  asymmetric  factor.  The 
increase  or  decrease  in  values  depends  on  the  change  in  sign 
of  gardient  with  respect  to  weight  ωij  It  converges  to  a  local 
minima but is able to skip through flat surfaces fast due to η+ 
multiplicative  factor.  Algorithm  3  shows  the  pseudocode  of

update  value  for  each  weight  i.e.  the  size  of  weight  update. 
∆max and ∆min are the maximum and minimum change and ∆wij 
is the change in weights.

VI.  EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS 

A.  Experimental Setup 

1)  System setup 

An 8 cabinet cluster with 397 nodes was taken for carrying 
out experimentations of BAMHealthCloud. Each node had 
12  cores  and  hence,  the  total  number  of  cores  was  4764 
(397x 12). The total memory available per node was 64 GB 
and therefore, the total memory available was 768GB (12x 
64).  The  experimental  data  that  were  used  are  real 
handwritten  signature  data  that  were  collected  through 
handheld devices. 

2)  Dataset Used 

Different  handheld  devices  such  as  Smart  phones,  tablets, 
phablets,  personal  digital  assistants  (PDAs)  were  used  for 
acquiring  data.  The  signature  samples  were  collected  from 
9000 users. The users involved both the staff and patients. The 
data  has  been  recorded  in  five  temporal  sessions  separated 
over a period of one week per 1500 users. The data collected 
comprised  of  2000  staff  members  and  7000  patients.  40 
samples  were  collected  from  each  user,  25  were  genuine  and 
15  samples  were  forged.  Therefore,  the  total  number  of 
samples stored was 360000. 

In order to comply to the  ethics involved  with collection of 
such  significant  and  critical  information,  the  participants 
consent was taken on the clause that their identity will be kept 
anonymous.  The  participants  were  only  identified  as  either 
staff  or  patients,  apart  from  this  all  the  personal  information 
were kept anonymous. 

Table  III  shows  the  features  that  have  been  recorded  while 
capturing  signatures  [19].   The  features  include  Acceleration, 
Magnetic Field, Orientation and Angular Velocity which were 
recorded while capturing signatures. 

3)  Data Preparation and  Processing 

In  order  to  prepare  data  for  training  purpose,  the  raw  data 
was firstly preprocessed by using hadoop framework. The data 
was first imported into hadoop distribuited file system and was 
then  reduced  using  Principal  component  analysis  (PCA)  [20] 
technique. MapReduce code for PCA was executed in order to 
carry  out  all  the  computations  in  a  parallel  manner.  It  should 
be  noted  that  since  the  dataset  used  was  very  large,  the 
processing  involved  multiple  mapper  functions  spanning 
across  several  nodes  of  the  cluster.  Hadoop2.x  which  is  the 
latest  version  has  been  utilized  in  our  experimentations.  The 
replication  factor  of  3  which  was  adopted  ensured  that  our 
system  is  robust  against  any  node  failures.  Furthermore, 
robustness  was  also  ensured  through  speculative  execution 
property of hadoop cluster.  

B.  Evaluation metrics

Where, TrueGenuine is the number of genuine users who 
are  classified  as  a  genuine  by  BAMHealthCloud. 
FalseGenuine  is  number  of  genuine  users  who  have  not 
been  correctly  classified,  TrueForged  is  number  of  forged 
users  who  have  been  falsely  classified  as  genuine  and 
FalseForged  is  number  of  forged  users  who  have  been 
correctly classified as forged. 

4)  Speedup: 

Speedup of BAMHealthCloud is defined as the amount of 
performance  gain  which  is  obtained  by  running  the 
system  on  a  single  machine  in  contrast  to  that  when  it  is 
run  on  multiple  machines.  The  speedup  according  to 
Amdahl’s 
equation  6. 
 

is  given  by

𝑇(1)

𝑇(𝑃)

)      

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

                   (6) 

Where P is the number of processors, S (P) is the speedup 
achieved while running computation on P processors, T (1) 
is  the  running  time  on  a  single  processor  and  T (P)  is  the 
running time on P processors. 

C.  Results 

In  order  to  validate  the  authenticity  of  BAMHealthCloud, 
experiments  have  been  performed.  The 
results  of 
BAMHealthCloud  have  been  compared 
the  other 
approaches  that  have  been  used  in  recent  literature  and  are 
summarized  in  Fig.  6  and  Fig.  7.  Fig.  6  shows  the  results  in 
terms  of  Equal  Error  Rate  (EER),  sensitivity  and  specificity, 
while  Fig.  7  shows  the  plot  of  running  times  of  the  different 
approaches. 

to 

From  Fig.  6,  we  can  see  that  results  obtained  from  the 
proposed  framework  are  better  than  the  other  compared 
approaches  in  literature.  BAMHealthCloud  achieves  an  EER 
of  0.12  which  is  better  than  the  rest  of  the  approaches  used. 
The  sensitivity  of  the  proposed  system  is  0.98  and  the 
specificity  is  0.95  which  is  again  better  than  the  existing 
approaches implemented in literature. 

In order to further validate the effectiveness of the proposed 
approach,  the  running  time  of  BAMHealthCloud  has  been 
calculated  along  with  running  time  of  other  sequential 
approaches proposed in [12], [13] and [11] as shown in Fig.7. 
The experiments have been conducted rigorously 15 times and 
from  the  results  it  can  be  concluded  that  BAMHealthCloud 
took  lesser  time  to  run  than  these  approaches.  The  results 
furthermore,  show  that  a  speedup  of  9x  was  achieved  by 
BAMHealthCloud using equation 6. 

With the achieved results showing EER of 0.12, sensitivity 
of  0.98,  specificity  of  0.95  and  speed  up  of  9x,  it  can  be 
inferred  that  BAMHealthCloud  outperforms  all  the  other 
methods that have been used in healthcare sectors. Moreover, 
this approach can be successfully deployed for securing health 
data in real life. 

VII.  CONCLUSION 

In order to handle ever growing data of health sectors and to 
provide security to different  users and  staff involved, a cloud 
based  biometric  authentication  system  BAMHealthCloud  has 
been  proposed  in  this  paper.  This  model  is  developed  after 

performing  a  detailed  case  study  on  a  healthcare  centre  in  a 
developing country. This model has two different components, 
one component takes care of the management of the huge data 
that  is  being  generated  on  a  daily  basis  and  other  one  takes 
care  of  the  security  aspect.  ALGOHealthSecurityCheck  has 
been  proposed  in  this  work  which  performs  security  check 
using  parallelized  MapReduce  programming  model.  The  use 
of this model ensures the scalability, flexibility and robustness 
of  the  system.  Experiments  performed  on  this  system  reveal 
that  BAMHealthCloud  achieves  a  speedup  of  9x  which  is 
better  than  other  systems  implemented  in  recent  works.
