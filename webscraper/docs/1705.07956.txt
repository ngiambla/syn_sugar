Abstract. Social network data offer interesting opportunities in urban studies. In this study, we used 
Twitter data to analyse city dynamics over the course of the day. Users of this social network were 
grouped according to city zone and time slot in order to analyse the daily dynamics of the city and 
the relationship between this and land use. First, daytime activity in each zone was compared with 
activity at night in order to determine which zones showed increased activity in each of the time 
slots. Then, typical Twitter activity profiles were obtained based on the predominant land use in 
each  zone,  indicating  how  land  uses  linked  to  activities  were  activated  during  the  day,  but  at 
different  rates  depending  on  the  type  of  land  use.  Lastly,  a  multiple  regression  analysis  was 
performed to determine the influence of the different land uses on each of the major time slots 
(morning, afternoon, evening and  night)  through their changing  coefficients.  Activity tended  to 
decrease throughout the day for most land uses (e.g. offices, education, health and transport), but 
remained constant in parks and increased in retail and residential zones. Our results show that 
social network data can be used to improve our understanding of the link between land use and 
urban dynamics.

1. INTRODUCTION 
Internet users are no longer mere passive recipients of information, but have become producers of 
vast  amounts  of  data,  particularly  through  social  networks.  Many  social  media  apps  (Twitter, 
Foursquare  and  Facebook  are  three  common  examples)  have  geo-location  features  that 
(optionally) includes the ability to attach locational information in the form of coordinates provided 
by the units GPS or place names provided by the user, thereby enabling individual users to leave a 
digital ‘geographic footprint’ of their movement when posting a message (Blanford et al., 2015). 
These  digital  data  shadows  are  intimately  intermingled  with  offline,  material  geographies  of 
everyday life (Shelton et al, 2015). High spatial and temporal social media data reveals activity 
patterns  information  moving  beyond  the  nighttime  residential  geographies  of  conventional 
geodemographic data sources (Longley et al., 2015). 
Twitter  has  become  an  important  sensor  of  the  interactions  between  individuals  and  their 
environment (Frias-Martinez, V., & Frias-Martinez, E. (2014). Twitter data contains precise spatial 
and temporal information which can be used to perform spatiotemporal demographic analyses. It 
has been observed that residential zones on the periphery of cities generate more tweets in the 
evening, when people have returned to their homes, whereas areas of activity in the city centre are 
especially active during the day, when people visit them to undertake activities such as work or 
shopping  (Ciuccarelli  et  al.,  2014).  The  spatiotemporal  pattern  of  tweets  posted  from  different 
zones in the city indicates the existence of the inherent linkage between the human urban activity 
pattern and the underlying land use structure (Zhan et al., 2014). 
The aim of this study was to use information from the social network Twitter in order to analyse 
city dynamics throughout the day and the relationship between this and land use. We estimated 
the number of unique active users in each zone of the city of Madrid throughout the day, as a proxy 
for  the  changing  location  of  the  population.  Then,  we  analysed  Twitter  activity  (active  users) 
throughout the day according to land use, yielding typical activity profiles for each land use. Lastly, 
we calculated multiple regression models (OLS) for each time slot to explain Twitter activity based 
on square metres of each land use in each zone of the city. The underlying hypothesis was that if 
each land use possessed a characteristic Twitter activity profile, then the surface area of each land 
use should satisfactorily explain the distribution of tweeters in the city in each time slot. An analysis 
of  the  coefficients  of  the  independent  variables  should  indicate  the  changing  influence  of  the 
different land uses according to time slots in agreement with the typical activity profiles previously 
obtained. 
In contrast to previous studies that have used clustering algorithms for city zones according to the 
Twitter activity taking place and then relate the classification obtained to the land use, in our study 
we analysed the specific time profiles of each land use based on a prior classification of land use for 
urban planning and then used explanatory models that linked land use and Twitter activity. Another 
distinguishing feature of our study is that the unit of analysis was the Twitter user rather than the 
geotagged  tweet.  We  focused  not  on  the  spatiotemporal  distribution  of  tweets  but  on  that  of 
Twitter  users,  as  a  proxy  for  the  changing  location  of  the  population  throughout  the  day.  This 
approach mitigates the bias derived from different intensities of Twitter use, which gives more 
weight  to  users  who  tweet  more  often,  and  above  all,  it  provides  useful  information  for  the 
provision of public sector services and private sector business activities. 
The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 presents a literature review on the 
use  of  Twitter  data  in  urban  studies,  especially  in  relation  to  land  uses.  Section  3  reports  the 
methodology and data. Section 4 contains an analysis of the results and section 5 presents the main 
conclusions.

2. HUMAN ACTIVITIES AND LAND USES: SPATIOTEMPORAL PATTERNS OF DIGITAL FOOTPRINTS 
IN THE CITY 
Social network users generate a vast amount of data. Worldwide, 500 million Twitter messages are 
posted every day, there are 7,000 million check-ins on Foursquare, and more than 80 million photos 
are uploaded on Instagram. Most studies based on social network data have used Twitter (Murthy, 
2013), due in large part to the fact that the data (tweets) can be freely downloaded by connecting 
to the Twitter Streaming API. This realtime, public, and cost-free data stream covers only around 
1–2  percent  of  the  whole  stream  of  tweets  (Andrienko  et  al.,  2013).  Some  of  the  tweets  are 
geotagged. These facilitate profiling of usage across space as well as time and have been found to 
be a useful tool for urban research (Lansley and Longley, 2016). 
Within a city from the centre to the periphery, the densities decrease in general, so tweet densities 
would  be  a  good  surrogate  of  population  densities  (Jiang  et  al.,  2016).  Maps  of  the  spatial 
distribution of tweets can be enriched with user IDs, tweet content and language. Thus, Longley et 
al. (2015) inferred the gender, age and ethnicity of tweeters from the user ID (username field) and 
analysed the spatial distribution of the tweets posted by each of the groups identified. Lansley and 
Longley (2016) and Andrienko et al. (2013) focused on tweet content in order to examine frequently 
tweeted words and  their  spatiotemporal patterns.  Meanwhile,  Mocanue et  al. (2013) used the 
language of tweets to identify linguistically specific urban communities. It is also possible to analyse 
the degree of social mixing in the use of space, tracking the movement of demographic groups 
within cities (Netto et al., 2015; Shelton et al., 2015). In contrast to the information provided by 
official sources, which offer data on place of residence, these studies on multiculturalism and social 
mixing analyse the use of space throughout the day. 
Through spatiotemporal monitoring of the tweets posted by each user, it is possible to deduce 
population mobility patterns (Wu et al., 2014; Blanford et al., 2015; Longley and Adnan, 2016), 
identify demographic groups based on user names (Luo et al., 2016) and obtain origin-destination 
matrices (Gao et al., 2014). The reliability of Twitter data in mobility studies has been validated by 
Lenormand et al. (2014), who compared Twitter data with mobile phone records and official data 
(census) and concluded that the three sources offer comparable results. 
The spatial distribution of tweets in the inner city changes over the course of the day, reflecting 
changes in the location of the population. Areas of the city with similar time profiles can be grouped 
using clustering algorithms in order to identify clusters of common tweeting activity. Thus, Frías-
Martínez et al. (2012) and Frías-Martínez and Frías-Martínez (2014) identified four clusters with 
specific tweeting activity signatures that basically corresponded to the following types of land use: 
business, leisure/weekend, nightlife and residential. Using a similar methodology, Zhan et al. (2014) 
inferred  four  broad  categories  of  land  use  based  on  a  spatiotemporal  analysis  of  Twitter  data: 
residential, retail, open space/recreation and transportation/utility. A similar approach has been 
adopted  in  other  studies  (e.g.,  Pei  et  al.,  2014;  Ríos  and  Muñoz,  2017),  in  which  clustering 
algorithms have been used to group city zones with similar profiles according to mobile phone 
activity, or Chen et al. (2017) in China using the social media “Tencent”. These methodologies based 
on  clustering  the  tweeting  activity  profiles  of  different  areas  in  the  city  could  be  used  as  an 
alternative to satellite imagery, to infer urban land uses based on social network data. However, 
the  land  use  categories  obtained  are  very  generic,  and  their  usefulness  for  urban  planning  is 
therefore limited. 
 
3. DATA AND METHODOLOGY 
3.1 Downloading and processing data 
One  of  the  most  widespread  social  networks  is  undoubtedly  Twitter,  a  platform  for  posting 
messages with a maximum of 140 characters, known as tweets. The service has more than 270 

 

3 

million active users around the world. Roughly 80% of active Twitter users access the service via a 
mobile telephone (Lansley and Longley, 2016). Since 2010, Twitter provided users with the ability 
to include their location either by attaching coordinates or a place name while tweeting, therefore 
making it possible to locate tweets geographically both in space and over time (Blanford et al., 
2015). Tweets are automatically geotagged by the GPS of mobile devices, provided that the user 
has enabled this function. Geotagged Tweets account for approximately just 1% of all the messages 
that are sent using the Twitter service (Blanford et al., 2015). 
Twitter data was downloaded and pre-processed as follows: 

a)  Data download 

The data used for this study was downloaded via the Twitter Streaming API over two consecutive 
years (from January 2012 to December 2013). Only geotagged tweets were downloaded, selecting 
those that covered the municipality of Madrid. Besides the coordinates, each tweet also carries 
information about the user ID, the date and time the tweet was posted, the device language setting, 
device type and the text of the message. We downloaded over 6.8 billion tweets in the city of 
Madrid.  The  data  were  loaded  into  a  GIS  (ArcGIS  10.4),  creating  a  layer  of  points  with  the 
coordinates x y of the position from which each of them was posted. Subsequently, we selected 
tweets that had been posted on typical workdays (Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday), obtaining 
a total of 3.07 million tweets. 

b)  Spatial and temporal aggregation of data to obtain the number of unique active users 

The same user often posts several tweets from the same location at the same time. The number of 
such tweets can be extremely high with some users, leading to an overestimation of the presence 
of this type of user at these locations and times. It is therefore necessary to analyse unique users 
rather than tweets. To this end, the tweets were aggregated spatially and temporally (every quarter 
of an hour) depending on the user ID, to obtain the presence of unique active users in each spatial 
unit rather than the number of tweets posted. This approach eliminates compulsive users who 
remain in the same place. 
Spatial  aggregation  of  Twitter  data  was  based  on  the  spatial  zones  established  by  the  Madrid 
transport authority. This zoning was chosen because although most transport zones present some 
degree of mixed land use, in general they form homogeneous spatial units from the point of view 
of  land  use  and  building  typology.  In  addition,  these  zones  are  sufficiently  large  to  register  a 
significant number of tweets. The possibility of using cells or hexagons (Shelton et al., 2015) was 
ruled out. Cells undoubtedly have the advantage of mitigating the problem of modified spatial units 
(Openshaw, 1984), since they form spatial units of the same size and shape; however, such units 
are not homogeneous from the point of view of land use, and the aim of our research was to relate 
the number of Twitter users to land use. The temporal sequence obtained of the presence of unique 
active users in each transport zone every quarter of an hour can be viewed in the attached video, 
which shows how hot spots shifted from the centre, in the morning and the afternoon, towards the 
periphery, at night. 
To  relate  the  distribution  of  unique  active  Twitter  users  to  land  use,  each  transport  zone  was 
characterised in terms of percentage of surface area occupied by each land use, based on land 
registry records. Initially, three main types of land use were distinguished: residential (when more 
than 66.6% of built surface in the area was residential), activity (when more than the 66.6% was 
non-residential, e.g. offices, industry, retail or education) and mixed residential (all other cases). In 
addition, the areas of activity were classified into 9 types: offices, industry, retail, health, education, 
culture, large transport terminals, parks and others. Figure 1 shows the predominant land use in 
each of the zones.

c)  Normalisation of data and calculation of the number of users per transport zone and time 

of day 

One of biases presented by Twitter when using temporal information is the different use made of 
this social network over the course of the day. Twitter is used more in the evening than in the 
morning or at mid-day (Figure 2). The highest peak in users occurred at ten pm (over 7%), whereas 
this figure fell to less than 4% at 8-9 am. 

Figure 2. Distribution of the number of Twitter users in Madrid according to time slot

To eliminate this bias, daily distribution data were grouped by time slot and the distributions were 
normalised, so that the total number of unique active users per time slot was equalised to 100,000, 
using the following formula: 
 

 

𝑇𝑇𝑧𝑧ℎ𝑛𝑛= 𝑇𝑇𝑧𝑧ℎ𝑇𝑇ℎ∗100000, 

where 𝑇𝑇𝑧𝑧ℎ𝑛𝑛 is the normalised number of unique active users in zone z at time slot h; 𝑇𝑇𝑧𝑧ℎ is the 
number of unique active users in zone z at time slot h and 𝑇𝑇ℎ is the total number of active tweeters 

at time slot h. 
Subsequently, the data were aggregated into four time slots to facilitate analysis: a) morning (07:00 
to 12:59), b) afternoon (13:00 to 17:59), c) evening (18:00 to 22:00) and d) night (22:00 to 23:59)1. 
 
3.2 Analysis of spatial distribution patterns 
Initially, the spatial distribution patterns were analysed by mapping unique active users according 
to large time slots. Descriptive statistics were obtained for these distributions. In this case, since 
the  data  were  normalised,  the  mean  distributions  were  similar  in  all  cases,  but  their  standard 
deviations  showed  the  degree  of  concentration  or  dispersion  of  Twitter  users.  High  standard 
deviation values are associated with more concentrated spatial patterns (users are concentrated 
more in some zones and less in others). In contrast, low standard deviation values indicate user 
dispersion (more uniform distribution throughout the zones). 
To  compare  the  distributions  according  to  time  slot,  we  conducted  a  bivariate  Ordinary  Least 
Squares  (OLS)  analysis.  ArcGIS10.4  software  was  used  to  obtain  both  the  coefficient  of 
determination  and  the  spatial  distribution  of  the  residuals.  The  coefficient  of  determination 
indicates  the  degree  of  relationship  between  two  variables  (the  overlap  between  data 
distributions),  while  an  analysis  of  normalised  residual  plots  identifies  differences  between  the 
distributions. Although we analysed all the relationships between the four major time slots, we 
focused primarily on comparing night-time distribution (as a baseline reference) with each of the 
other time slots. 
 
3.3 Temporal profiles according to land use 
Temporal  profiles  according  to  land  use  were  calculated  using  the  normalised  distributions  of 
unique active users according to zone every quarter of an hour and the predominant land use in 
each zone. The total number of unique active users every quarter of an hour in a zone was assigned 
to the predominant land use, and then the total number of users according to land use was summed 
                                                            
1 The assumption that the normalised number of unique active users reflected the location of the population 
should be contrasted with the ground truth. Official data record the location of the population according to 
place of residence (night-time residential geographies), but do not provide information on the location of the 
population over the course of the day. Therefore, a comparison with the ground truth can only be performed 
with night-time data (Lin and Cromley, 2015). As in previous studies (e.g. Luo et al., 2016; Salas-Olmedo and 
Rojas,  2017), we  defined  “home”  as  the  place  most  frequently  visited by  a user at night-time.  Thus,  we 
included users who tweeted between 22:00 and 24:00 from residential buildings. In order to verify if the 
number of the detected residents out of the Twitter users in each transport zone adequately reflected the 
distribution  of  the  population  according  to  official  data  (Register  of  Inhabitants  2013,  Spanish  National 
Statistics Institute), we calculated the correlation coefficient between the two variables, obtaining an r2 value 
of 0.46, indicating that the number of resident tweeters is a good proxy for the distribution of the population.

for each quarter of an hour. This approach yielded the temporal distribution of unique active users 
for each land use. 
 
3.4 Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) models 
Lastly, the relationship between Twitter user distribution and land use was analysed using four 
multiple regression (OLS) models. The dependent variables were the normalised distributions of 
unique active users according to zone in each of the major time slots (Morning, Afternoon, Evening 
and Night). The explanatory variables were square metres of each type of land use in each of the 
zones  in  the  city.  Given  the  marked  centre-periphery  drop  in  the  intensity  of  Twitter  use  (see 
subsection 4.1), distance to the city centre was included in the models as a control variable. 
The OLS models were calculated in two steps. In the first step, we included all the independent 
variables  considered  initially  (land  uses  and  distance  to  the  centre).  In  the  second  step,  we 
eliminated non-significant variables and calculated the models again. The results shown in Table 4 
correspond to the second step, and the variables that proved non-significant in the first step and 
were discarded have been left blank. 
 
4. RESULTS 
4.1 Distribution of tweeters according to time slot 
Twitter  activity  in  the  different  city  zones  varied  substantially  according  to  time  slot.  For  the 
purpose of conducting comparisons, night-time was taken as the reference scenario (Figure 3). The 
differences in distribution according to time slot can be analysed using bivariate correlations (Table 
1). As is to be expected in a place with a wide variety of land uses such as Madrid, the coefficients 
of  determination  between  the  time  distributions  were  relatively  high  in  all  cases,  especially 
between successive time slots in the day. Taking the night as the reference, the greatest differences 
(lowest correlations) were observed between night and morning (homes vs activities). In contrast, 
the  correlations  were  highest  between  night  and  afternoon,  and  especially  between  night  and 
evening (when many people have returned home after a day’s work). 
The residual plots of the correlations between night and the rest of the time slots show the different 
behaviour of residential spaces and areas of activity throughout the day (Figure 4). Comparing night 
and  morning,  areas  of  activity  were  more  active  in  the  latter  slot  (positive  residuals  in  red), 
especially in office and mixed zones in the centre (with a high presence of offices) and in large 
complexes (e.g. university campuses and hospitals) and transport terminals (airport and railway 
stations). In contrast, residential areas presented negative residuals (in blue). Comparing night and 
evening, many areas of activity ceased activity while leisure centres and shopping areas became 
more active.

The descriptive statistics show that the lowest standard deviation occurred at night, indicating that 
active users were distributed throughout all zones in the city (Table 2). The standard deviation 
increased in the morning, when the population congregated in areas of activity, especially for work, 
but little use was made of leisure and shopping zones. The highest standard deviation value was 
recorded in the evening, when the population was more concentrated in the centre, engaged in 
shopping and leisure activities.

4.2 Temporal Twitter activity profiles according to land use 
Table 3 shows the number of unique users according to land uses and major time slots. Residential 
land use accounted for the highest number of users. For areas of activity, offices accounted for the 
highest  number  of  unique  users,  followed  by  education  and  retail.  An  analysis  of  data  density 
(normalised unique users / Ha) revealed that the highest values corresponded to land uses that 
attract a large number of people throughout the day (transportation, culture and retail), whereas 
parks and industry attracted very low densities.

Table 3 also shows the total number of users by time slot and land use. To facilitate comparisons, 
the graph in Figure 5 uses relative values to depict very different temporal profiles according to the 
main types of land use. The curve for residential areas indicates greater activity at night than during 
the day, while the areas of activity have a much more uneven profile, with a very sharp peak in the 
morning and a marked drop at night, and as expected, mixed areas show an intermediate situation 
between the two previous categories. 

 

Figure 5. Temporal distribution of active users according to the main types of land use 

(percentage)

 

 
The temporal distribution of active users in areas of activity was obtained by combining specific 
profiles  associated  with  different  types  of  land  use  (Figure  6).  The  main  transportation 
infrastructures (airport and railway stations) presented a very early and marked peak. Industry also 
began  very  early,  although  the  fluctuations  were  less  pronounced  over  the  course  of  the  day. 
Education, health and offices showed activity some time later and can be differentiated by the 
marked peak in the morning in education, which was much less pronounced for offices. Parks and 
sports  areas  showed  a  very  stable  distribution  throughout  the  day,  whereas  retail  areas  were 
particularly active in the afternoon, after the working day had ended.

4.3 Influence of land use on Twitter activity: OLS models 
The results of the OLS models obtained for the different time slots (Table 4) confirmed a close 
relationship between the spatial distribution of land uses and Twitter activity, since the adjusted 
coefficients of determination ranged between 0.61 (at night) and 0.76 (in the morning), all with F-
statistic values significant at the 0.000 level. Of the explanatory variables considered initially, only 
two (health and industry) were not significant in all models2. At night (from 22 to 24 hours) the 
variables education, culture and parks were not significant either. Most of the population is at home 
in this time slot (residential). The presence of categories other than residential in the night model 
might be due primarily to leisure activities, which were encompassed in the category of others, but 
were also scattered throughout the city centre in areas where residential use was mixed with other 
land uses such as offices and retail. Irrespective, the coefficients were very low at night for offices, 
retail and transportation. The VIF parameter was less than 2 for all significant variables in the four 
models, indicating that there was no problem of collinearity between the explanatory variables. 
As expected, the coefficients of the four models presented positive signs for the various categories 
of land use and a negative sign for distance to the centre. Thus, the greater the surface area of each 
land use category, the higher the number of active tweeters, and the further away from the centre, 
the  lower  the  amount  of  Twitter  activity.  The  coefficients  offer  relevant  information  on  the 
elasticities between number of tweeters and each of the predictor variables. In general, the highest 
coefficients corresponded to the variables education, culture and retail, indicating that an increase 

                                                            
2 Industry is not an activity conducive to workers making use of social networks (in fact, the density of tweets 
posted from predominantly industrial areas was very low), but this may vary considerably according to the 
degree to which these spaces are occupied by companies in the service sector (offices). The second case is 
more  surprising,  since  patients  in  waiting  rooms  have  time  that  they  could  fill  by  making  use  of  social 
networks. One explanation for this finding might be the existence of extremely varied health spaces, ranging 
from large hospitals to private consultants, with a very different intensity of Twitter use.

of one unit (one square metre) in these land use categories resulted in a higher increase in tweeters 
than that recorded for the other categories. 
The  variation  in  the  coefficients  of  the  independent  variables  over  the  course  of  the  day  is 
consistent  with  what  was  observed  in  the  Twitter  activity  profiles  according  to  land  use.  The 
coefficients fell sharply throughout the day in education and transport, whereas this drop was less 
pronounced in offices and culture. In contrast, the coefficients rose throughout the day in retail, 
parks and residential zones. The coefficient of the variable distance to the city centre was lower at 
night, indicating that the centre-periphery gradient of Twitter activity fell at night, given that there 
is more residential land use on the periphery than in the centre.

5. FINAL REMARKS 
Social networks and big data provide previously unavailable information about urban dynamics, 
opening up new opportunities in the field of urban studies (Graham and Shelton, 2013). In this 
study,  we  used  data  from  one  of  the  most  widespread  social  networks  (Twitter)  to  analyse 
spatiotemporal demographics in a city. Obviously, the data must be filtered and processed before 
analysis. In this case, we downloaded and geotagged each of the tweets and aggregated the data 
spatially and temporally in order to obtain the number of active users according to city zone and 
time slot. In contrast to other studies that have employed classification algorithms to obtain groups 
of zones and compare them with land use distribution (inferring land use from Twitter activity), our 
approach pursues a deeper understanding of the influence of land use on activity in the city. Our 
groups of land uses were predefined according to a more accurate and useful classification for 
urban planning than the main groups identified in previous research.

Our analysis of the correlation between the distribution of active tweeters in the night time slot 
and the different day time slots provides an initial insight into city dynamics, revealing the zones 
which gain or lose activity in each of the time slots over the course of the day. The former are usually 
located in the centre and the latter predominate in the periphery, with the logical exception of 
certain  areas  of  activity  such  as  universities,  offices  or  the  airport.  Our  approach  has  made  it 
possible  to  visually  identify  that  offices,  education  and  the  main  transportation  terminals  gain 
activity in the morning, whereas retail areas are most active in the evening. 
Subsequently, we linked Twitter activity and land use. First, we performed a descriptive analysis 
based on typical Twitter activity profiles according to the predominant land use in each transport 
zone. A marked contrast was observed between residential zones, with increased activity at night, 
and areas of activity, which were much more active during the day. For most activities, the curve 
fell from the morning to the evening, except for parks (which had a very stable curve) and retail 
areas (which showed more activity in the evening than in the morning). Transport terminals and 
industry presented an early peak which was much more pronounced in the former than in the 
latter. When the predominant use was education, health or offices, this peak appeared later on in 
the day, being especially marked in education and less so in offices. 
An analysis of zone activity profiles is a simplification, since we only considered the predominant 
land use in each zone, when most of them host several land uses. Furthermore, this is also a purely 
descriptive analysis. The OLS analysis examined the influence of the different land uses in each zone 
on Twitter activity according to time slot. As expected, the coefficients of the independent variables 
in all models presented positive signs for the land use variables and a negative sign for distance to 
the centre. The variation in coefficients over the course of the day is consistent with the results 
obtained for Twitter activity profiles according to predominant land use: rising for residential and 
retail zones, and falling for education, offices and transport. 
Our analyses provide useful information for urban planning, because the results shed light on urban 
dynamics in relation to land use. This is of interest as regards the provision of services in the public 
sector  (for  example,  risk  assessment  and  population  evacuation  plans)  and  for  private  sector 
business activities (potential demand according to zone and time of day). In addition, knowledge of 
the link between activities and land use can be used to predict future patterns of activity in new 
urban developments, by using the OLS model to estimate the spatiotemporal distribution of the 
population according to the envisaged land uses in a new development. 
It is clear that social networking data present biases. In the case of Twitter, although it generates 
an enormous amount of data every day, it is only used by a small percentage of the population. It 
is also used very unevenly, with some tweeters posting a lot of tweets whereas others only use the 
network  from  time  to  time.  This  bias  can  only  be  partially  mitigated,  by  means  of  data  pre-
processing  to  focus  the  analysis  not  on  tweets  but  on  the  tweeters.  Nevertheless,  it  has  been 
possible to conduct an analysis of the dynamics of city activity and obtain consistent results.
