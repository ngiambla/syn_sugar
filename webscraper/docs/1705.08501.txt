Abstract

The crowdfunding market size has increased exponentially,
reaching tens of billions of dollars and showing the popular-
ity of crowdfunding. However, according to Kickstarter, 35%
backers did not receive rewards on time. To maintain the trust
between creators and backers, and sustain the crowdfund-
ing business growth, it is crucial to understand how on-time
and late reward delivery projects are different. In this paper,
we analyze characteristics of on-time and late reward deliv-
ery projects, especially, focusing on project descriptions, cre-
ator proﬁles, and activeness and linguistic patterns of creators
and backers. Our analysis reveals that the less complicated a
project is and more actively a creator responds to backers,
the higher an on-time reward delivery probability is. It shows
there are signiﬁcant differences between on-time and late re-
ward delivery projects.

Introduction

In recent years, reward-based crowdfunding platforms like
Kickstarter and Indiegogo have become popular with in-
creasing number of projects and backers. As shown in Figure
1, a project has two phases: the fundraising phase and the re-
ward delivery phase. In the fundraising phase, creators seek
funding for their projects, and backers fund projects that they
are interested in. In the reward delivery phase, creators of
successfully funded projects make and ship their rewards.

In the literature, researchers mostly focused on the
fundraising phase by understanding the dynamics of crowd-
funding platforms as well as the interaction and the rela-
tionship between creators and backers (Kuppuswamy and
Bayus 2015; Tran et al. 2016), predicting successful projects
(Chung and Lee 2015; Li, Rakesh, and Reddy 2016), and
recommending creators to backers or vice versa (Rakesh,
Choo, and Reddy 2015).

However, little attention has been paid to the reward deliv-
ery phase, even though 35% backers did not receive rewards
on time1. If receiving rewards on time, the backers will be
more likely to invest the creator’s new projects. Therefore,
delivering the rewards on time is crucial as it helps creators
to maintain trust with backers and to retain backers’ upcom-
ing investments.

To achieve trustworthy crowdfunding platforms, the ﬁrst
step is to understand how on-time and late reward delivery
projects are different. Can we ﬁnd distinguishing properties
between on-time and late reward delivery projects? In this
paper, we focus on this question and analyze characteris-
tics of these projects. If we ﬁnd distinguishing properties,
creators can improve new projects’ descriptions, and com-
munication skills with backers toward planning their project
well and delivering promised rewards on time.

In particular, we extracted and analyzed various charac-
teristics of projects and creators which distinguish between
on-time and late reward delivery projects. Through our com-
prehensive analysis of 2,198 sampled Kickstarter projects,
we found that:
• There were 12 project and creator related features, which
distinguished between on-time and late reward delivery
projects. Less complicated projects (e.g., a lower amount
of goal and less number of rewards) had a higher chance
to deliver rewards on time.

• During the reward delivery phase, creators in on-time
reward delivery projects posted updates and comments
more quickly than creators in late reward delivery
projects. Backers in on-time reward delivery projects
asked less number of questions through comments.

• Creators in on-time and late reward delivery projects had
different linguistic usage in their updates. Similarly, we
found that backers in on-time and late reward delivery
projects had different linguistic usage in their comments.

Dataset

Figure 2 shows a reward example on Kickstarter. A reward
consists of a description, price, the number of pledged back-
ers, and an estimated delivery date. According to Kickstarter
policy, a creator sets up her rewards before launching the
project. Once a reward is pledged, it is not allowed her to
edit the rewards. Based on this, we ﬁrst deﬁne what on-time
and late reward delivery projects mean as follows:
• A project is called an on-time reward delivery project if
all the rewards associated with the project were shipped
by the longest estimated delivery date (LEDD) among es-
timated delivery dates of the rewards.

Figure 1: Project Timeline in reward-based crowdfunding platforms.

Figure 2: An example of a Kickstarter reward.

• A project is called a late reward delivery project if the cre-
ator did not deliver at least one of rewards by the longest
estimated delivery date (LEDD).

First of all, we selected 29,499 successful projects
launched between 2009 and September 2014, and their goals
were at least $100. Next, we sampled 10% of 29,499 suc-
cessful projects with keeping the same project distribution
over project categories, year and goal. Finally, we sampled
2,949 projects, and collected their pages, corresponding cre-
ator proﬁles, and associated updates and comments. To get
the ground-truth regarding whether a project is on-time or
late reward delivery project, three labelers independently
read all the project updates and comments and labeled the
2,949 projects based on the following guidelines:
• A project was labeled as an on-time reward delivery
project if: (i) the labeler could identify that all the rewards
were shipped before LEDD, and (ii) there was no com-
plaint regarding not receiving the rewards.

• A project was labeled as a late reward delivery project if
the creator posted at least one update or comment saying
that the reward shipping process would be delayed and a
new delivery date beyond LEDD was provided.

• A project would be excluded if there was no information
to verify whether all the rewards were sent on time or not.

Finally, 1,003 projects were labeled as on-time reward de-
livery projects, and 1,195 projects were labeled as late re-
ward delivery projects. 751 projects were excluded because
of the third guideline.

Characteristics

In this section, we analyze the 2,198 projects, and associated
creators and backers’ behavior to understand characteristics
of on-time and late reward delivery projects.
Project Characteristics: When creating a project, the cre-
ator has to select its category from 15 categories predeﬁned
by Kickstarter. We are interested in ﬁnding whether a pro-
portion of on-time reward delivery projects was equal or not
across the 15 categories. Can we observe creators in certain
categories sent more rewards on time? To answer the ques-
tion, we analyzed category distributions and plotted them in
Figure 3. Interestingly, rewards in most dance and theater
related projects were delivered on time, whereas rewards in
most games, technology, comics, and ﬁlm related projects
were not delivered on time. We analyzed these rewards, and
found that project rewards in dance and theater were live
performances, showcases or teaching dancing classes which

were served to backers at once. In contrast, project rewards
in other categories such as games, technology, comics, and
ﬁlm were real products (e.g., a game, book, movie), requir-
ing more time to produce and ship the products to backers.
The analysis and observation conﬁrm that creators in certain
categories delivered more rewards on time.

We next analyzed project related features to see if they
help to distinguish on-time and late reward delivery projects.
Table 1 presents statistical information of 12 project fea-
tures: fundraising duration, goal, amount of pledged money,
# of images, # of videos, # of FAQs, # of rewards, # of back-
ers, # of sentences in a project description, # of sentences in
a reward description, and a smog score (McLaughlin 2008)
of each of project and reward descriptions. We performed
the one-tailed two samples t-test to determine which fea-
ture had a signiﬁcant mean difference in one direction. We
found that on-time reward delivery projects had some dis-
tinguishing characteristics compared to late reward delivery
projects: (i) shorter fundraising duration; (ii) lower goal and
pledged money; (iii) less number of images, videos, FAQs,
and rewards; (iv) larger number of sentences in the project
description, but smaller number of sentences in the reward
description; and (v) lower smog score of a project descrip-
tion, indicating more readable.

We are also interested in exploring “Did a longer deliv-
ery duration range increase a proportion of on-time delivery
projects?”. Figure 4 shows a proportion of on-time and late
delivery projects in each delivery duration range with the
number of projects. It shows that the proportion of on-time
delivery projects was quite equally distributed across deliv-
ery duration ranges. Even 44% projects, whose duration was
greater than 10 months, were late delivery projects. It indi-
cates that longer delivery duration does not always increase
a proportion of on-time delivery projects.
Creator Characteristics: We extracted 5 features related to

creators: # of backed projects, # of created projects, # of sen-
tences in a bio description, smog score of a bio description,
and # of Facebook friends. Then, we performed one-tailed
two samples t-test via the same process as we did for the
project related features. Table 2 shows our statistical results
for those features. There were two features differentiated on-
time and late reward delivery projects: # of backed projects
and smog score of a bio description. We observed that cre-
ators in on-time reward delivery projects had a smaller num-
ber of backed projects and a higher smog score.
Activeness of creators and backers during delivery dura-
tion: First, we measured the activeness of creators in two as-
pects: (1) the average time interval between two consecutive
updates during the delivery duration; and (2) the responsive-
ness of creators regarding a backer’s comment.

Figure 5(a) shows the average update time interval of on-
time and late delivery projects. Creators of the on-time de-
livery projects posted updates with shorter time interval than
creators of the late delivery projects. Creators of on-time
and late delivery projects had signiﬁcantly different behav-
ior with p-value < 0.001.

Backers often posted questions, as comments, regarding
the status of rewards during the delivery duration. Our hy-
pothesis is that creators of the on-time delivery projects
would respond more quickly than creators of late delivery
projects, showing they were paying more attention to the
backers. Figure 5(b) shows that our hypothesis is correct.
Creators of the on-time delivery projects had signiﬁcantly
different behavior compared with creators of the late deliv-
ery project (p-value < 0.05).

Next, we measured the activeness of backers during the
delivery duration. Did backers in on-time delivery projects
behave differently from ones in late delivery projects in
terms of posting more or less number of questions? Fig-
ure 5(c) shows the number of questions posted by backers

(a) The average update time interval
(***).

(b) The average time between a backer’s
question and reply from a creator. (*).

(c) The number of questions posted by
backers (***).

groups behaved differently. *,**,***, indicate p-value < 0.05, < 0.01, and < 0.001, respectively.

in on-time and late delivery projects. It makes sense that
backers in late delivery projects posted more questions than
backers in on-time delivery projects (p-value < 0.001).
Linguistic patterns: Did creators in on-time and late deliv-
ery projects have different linguistic usage? To answer this
question, we analyzed creators’ updates posted during the
delivery duration in terms of linguistic patterns. In particu-
lar, we used Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) dic-
tionary, a standard approach for mapping text to psycholog-
ically meaningful categories in various research areas (Lee
et al. 2014). LIWC-2007 deﬁnes 64 categories for each of
several languages (e.g., English, German, Dutch). Each cat-
egory contains several dozens to hundred of words or stems.
Given each project’s updates which were posted during
the reward delivery phase, we measured the linguistic usage
of the creator in 64 LIWC categories by computing his score
with regard to each category in LIWC dictionary. First, we
grouped all the updates of each project into one big docu-
ment. Next, we removed all stop words and counted the total
number of words N in the document. Then, we counted the
number of words in the document overlapped with the words
or matched the stems in each category i in LIWC dictionary,
denoted by Ci. Finally, we computed the creator’s score of a
LIWC category i as Ci/N.

We performed the two-sample t-test to discover the LIWC
categories in which two distributions had a signiﬁcant differ-
ence in the mean of score. Since we performed simultaneous
tests against 64 LIWC categories, we applied Bonferroni
correction and assigned α as 0.00078 (=0.05/64). Finally,
we observed 12 categories that had the signiﬁcant difference
of linguistic usage of creators in on-time and late delivery
projects. Top 3 distinguishing linguistic categories were pos-
itive emotion, affective process and cognitive processes. In-
terestingly, creators in on-time delivery projects used words
related to positive emotion (e.g., love, sweet) and affective
processes (e.g., happy) more than creators in late deliv-
ery projects. However, creators in on-time delivery projects
used words related to Cognitive processes (e.g., cause, know,
ought) less than creators in late delivery projects. This makes
sense since creators in late delivery projects usually posted
updates about reasons why their reward production or deliv-
ery process was delayed.

We also analyzed backers’ comments to understand their
linguistic usage via the same process and found 5 categories

with signiﬁcant difference: positive emotion, negative emo-
tion, anxiety, cognitive processes and insight. In particu-
lar, backers in on-time delivery projects used words related
to positive emotion more, and related to negative emotion
and cognitive processes less than backers in late delivery
projects. This result is consistent with creators’ linguistic
patterns.

Conclusion

It is crucial for creators to deliver rewards to backers on
time as it keeps and fosters the trust between them. As the
ﬁrst step to achieve trustworthy crowdfunding platforms, we
analyzed characteristics of on-time and late reward deliv-
ery projects. Particularly, we analyzed project-based charac-
teristics, creator-based characteristics, activeness-based and
linguistic-based characteristics of creators and backers dur-
ing the reward delivery phase. We found that less compli-
cated projects with more active response to backers had a
higher chance to ship rewards on time.
