The Geometry and Topology of Data and
Information for Analytics of Processes and

Behaviours: Building on Bourdieu and
Addressing New Societal Challenges

Fionn Murtagh

May 25, 2017

Abstract

We begin by summarizing the relevance and importance of inductive
analytics based on the geometry and topology of data and information.
Contemporary issues are then discussed. These include how sampling data
for representativity is increasingly to be questioned. While we can always
avail of analytics from a “bag of tools and techniques”, in the application
of machine learning and predictive analytics, nonetheless we present the
case for Bourdieu and Benz´ecri-based science of data, as follows. This is to
construct bridges between data sources and position-taking, and decision-
making. There is summary presentation of a few case studies, illustrating
and exemplifying application domains.

Introduction

From the data analytics viewpoint, a summary of the main procedural principles
and features of the analytical methodology arising out of Pierre Bourdieu’s work
is provided in Lebaron (2015). The following points are related to that summary.

1. Determine and display social ﬁeld structure, or even more comprehen-

sively, social space conﬁguration.

2. Show structural homologies between ﬁelds or social spaces, based on axis,

or factor, interpretation.

3. So, this is reasoning by analogy, therefore inductive reasoning, but in a
context that can use, in an integral manner, statistical modelling and
predictive learning. The latter encompasses machine learning methods.

4. Determine relative autonomy between ﬁelds or social spaces. This is
through use of comparative procedures, and causal hypotheses on the re-
lations between ﬁelds.

1

5. Study sub-spaces in a global social space. This is through use of class
speciﬁc analysis, or MCA, Multiple Correspondence Analysis of sub-clouds
of subjects.

6. Informed by statistics, and supervised (with training set, test set) ma-
chine learning, explain social practice and position-taking, with associated
decision-making.

7. Eﬀects and consequences, thus predictive ﬁeld-related outcomes. Here,
there may be integrated use of analysis of variance (ANOVA) or regression,
or of supervised machine learning methods.

8. Study ﬁeld dynamics using hierarchical classiﬁcation, in factor space, use
of appropriate supplementary or contextual elements (attributes, subjects)
that can form structuring factors, and fully integrate time-evolving data.

This comprehensive and far reaching data analysis methodology, will en-
compass statistical modelling, machine learning, predictive analytics, and vi-
sualization analytics, whenever these are relevant and appropriate. Relative
to current machine learning practice that can be characterized as the “bag of
tools and techniques” approach to analytics, the following are unquestionably
major beneﬁts. Field and homology, and underpinning these, geometry and
topology, employed for inductive reasoning, and relating such reasoning with
position-taking or decision making.

Themes of this article encompass the following: application of analytics
drawing on social ﬁelds and homology, and beyond; general and broad relevance
and applicability; underpinning the analytics, we may consider that we have:
data leading to information, leading to knowledge, leading to wisdom. Geomet-
ric data analysis (GDA), and based on GDA, topology, is the essential basis for
all such work.

In section 2, we both justify and strongly motivate Bourdieu-related analyt-

ics for contemporary data analytics problems.

In section 3, in our analytics, we are seeking explanatory or elucidatory
narratives. Three case studies are at issue. Firstly, there is the expression or
manifestation of underlying emotions. Secondly, there is the convergence of
events or activities, expressing causal or consequential outcomes. Thirdly, there
are the most inﬂuential patterns and trends in very large data sources.

Section 4 introduces particular issues in, and perspectives on, the analytics
of behaviour and activity. This is pursued with a preliminary study in section
5.

2 New Challenges and Opportunities in the Con-

text of Big Data Analytics

The following expands on our contribution to the discussion in Keiding and Louis
(2016). The comprehensive survey (with 141 references) of Keiding and Louis

2

(2016) sets out new contemporary issues of sampling and population distribution
estimation. An important take-home message is this: “There is the potential
for big data to evaluate or calibrate survey ﬁndings ... to help to validate cohort
studies”. Examples are discussed of “how data ... tracks well with the oﬃcial”,
and contextual, repository or holdings. It is well pointed out how one case study
discussed “shows the value of using ‘big data’ to conduct research on surveys
(as distinct from survey research)”. This arises from what has been discussed
by Japec et al., (2015): “The new paradigm means it is now possible to digitally
capture, semantically reconcile, aggregate, and correlate data.”

Limitations though are clear: “Although randomization in some form is very
beneﬁcial, it is by no means a panacea. Trial participants are commonly very
diﬀerent from the external ... pool, in part because of self-selection, ...”. This
is due to, “One type of selection bias is self-selection (which is our focus)”.

Important points towards addressing these contemporary issues include the
following. “When informing policy, inference to identiﬁed reference populations
is key”. This is part of the bridge which is needed, between data analytics
technology and deployment of outcomes. “In all situations, modelling is needed
to accommodate non-response, dropouts and other forms of missing data.”

While “Representativity should be avoided”, here is an essential way to
address in a fundamental way, what we need to address: “Assessment of external
validity, i.e. generalization to the population from which the study subjects
originated or to other populations, will in principle proceed via formulation of
abstract laws of nature similar to physical laws”.

Interesting perspectives that support Keiding and Louis (2016),

include
Friedman et al. (2015), and the following, from Laurison and Friedman (2015):
“... the GBCS [Great British Class Survey] data have three important limita-
tions. First, the GBCS was a self-selecting web-based survey, ... This means
it is not possible to make formal inferences.
... the nationally representative
nature of the Labour Force Survey (LFS) along with its detailed and accurate
measures ... facilitates a much more in-depth investigation ...” In a blog post-
ing, Laurison (2015) points very clearly to how, just “Because the GBCS is not
a random-sample or representative survey”, other ways can and are being found
to draw great beneﬁt.

Another diﬀerent study on open, free text questionnaires (Z¨ull and Scholz,
2011, see also 2015) notes selection bias, but also: “However, the reasonable
use of data always depends on the focus of analyses. So, if the bias is taken
into account, then group-speciﬁc analyses of open-ended questions data seem
appropriate”.

The bridge between the data that is analyzed, and the calibrating Big Data,
is well addressed by the geometry and topology of data. Those form the link
between sampled data and the greater cosmos. Bourdieu’s concept of ﬁeld is a
prime exemplar. Consider, as noted by Lebaron (2009), how Bourdieu’s work,
involves “putting his thinking in mathematical terms”, and that it “led him to
a conscious and systematic move toward a geometric frame-model”. This is a
multidimensional, “structural vision”. Bourdieu’s analytics “amounted to the
global [hence Big Data] eﬀects of a complex structure of interrelationships, which

3

is not reducible to the combination of the multiple [... eﬀects] of independent
variables”. The concept of ﬁeld, here, uses Geometric Data Analysis that is core
to the integrated data and methodology approach used in the Correspondence
Analysis platform (used, in general, in Murtagh, 2010; and comprehensively in
Le Roux, 2014).

An approach to drawing beneﬁt from Big Data is precisely as described
in Keiding and Louis (2016). The noting of the need for the “formulation
of abstract laws” that bridge sampled data and calibrating Big Data can be
addressed, for the data analyst and for the application specialist, as geometric
and topological.

The principles and practice following from the Big Data setting for our an-
alytics can also be linked to ethical issues. Consider, for example, that sources
of data start with: interviews, online media, and big data including data that
is unstructured, structured, heterogeneous multimedia, open linked, and so on.
One example is to consider the long term prediction of criminal activity, versus
the prediction of exposure or vulnerability to crime. The latter can lead to
preemptive and preventative action, with no ethical aspects involved. A narra-
tive approach, therefore using analytical ﬁeld dynamics, oﬀers a practical and
eﬀective alternative (Harcourt, 2002, 2006). Over and above the sole use of
quantitative prediction, we are noting the importance of integrated qualitative
and quantitative analytics.

In line with Harcourt’s work (Harcourt, 2002), with the central role of Corre-
spondence Analysis, this programme of work encompasses: not “content analy-
sis” but rather “map analysis”. I.e. “cognitive mapping, relational analysis, and
meaning analysis” among other names. Harcourt notes the need “to visually
represent the relationship between structures of social meaning and the contexts
and practices within which they are embedded”.

Harcourt’s work has case studies related to sexual activity, and activities
with ﬁrearms. We would propose the great importance of pursuing ﬁeld and
homology analytics, of underpinning geometric and topological data analysis,
for all levels of digital, online or cyber crime and misdemeanour. From Har-
court (2005): “Where do we stake the boundary of the criminal law – or, more
importantly, how? How do we decide what to punish? Do we distribute these
vices, these recreations, these conducts – what do we even call these things? –
into two categories, the passable and the penal, and then carve some limiting
principle to distinguish the two? Are we, in the very process, merely concocting
some permeable line – a Maginot line – to police the criminal frontier?”

In this section, we have noted the contemporary very wide-ranging, and
comprehensive, applicability of analytics that come from the work of Pierre
Bourdieu, taking the integral theory and practice of Jean-Paul Benz´ecri’s life
work. Note has also been made of how this can incorporate and include the
mostly sole use of “bag of tools and techniques” (informally expressed in this
way) characterization of unsupervised and supervised machine learning.

words (dots: not labelled for clarity here). Two of the beats are annotated, as

3 Narrative Analytics, and Narrative Synthesis

We consider a complex web of relationships. Semantics include web of rela-
tionships – thematic structures and patterns. Structures and interrelationships
evolve in time. Semantics include time evolution of structures and patterns,
including both: threads and commonality; and change, the exceptional, the
anomalous. Narrative can suggest a causal or emotional relationship between
events. A story is an expression of causality or connection. Narrative connects
facts or views or other units of information.

In Murtagh et al. (2009), there is stochastic analysis of structure and style, of
the ﬁlm script of the movie, Casablanca, shot by Warner Brothers between May
and August 1942. This both statistically and qualitatively supports McKee’s
(1999) statement that the composition of Casablanca is “virtually perfect”.

An application that resulted from this work was visualization of narra-
tive, supporting collective, collaborative narrative construction. This related
to collective book authoring by literature students in university, and for many
books published, by school children, following this narrative display and support
framework. See Reddington et al. (2013).

Figure 1 displays and depicts McKee’s description of “mid-act climax”, scene
43, subdivided into 11 “beats” or subscenes. This portrays emotional attraction
and repulsion between Rick and Ilsa, on the second axis (respectively, here,
negative, positive directions); the ﬁrst axis counterposes externality relative to
the main location, Casablanca.

In the tracking of emotion, we are determining and tracking emotion in an

5

(This is not machine learning like in sentiment analysis,
unsupervised way.
which is supervised.) Emotion is understood as a manifestation of the un-
conscious. Social activity causes emotion to be expressed or manifested. (Cf.
Murtagh, 2014.)

We used chapters 9, 10, 11, 12 of Gustave Flaubert’s 19th century novel,
Madame Bovary. This concerns the three-way relationship between Emma Bo-
vary, her husband Charles, and her lover Rodolphe Boulanger.

In Figure 2, there is display of the evolution of sentiment, expressed by (or
proxied by) the terms “kiss”, “tenderness”, and “happiness”. We see that some
text segments are more expressive of emotion than are other text segments.

In Murtagh and Ganz (2015) we look at, ﬁrstly, emotional interaction in the
Casablanca movie, using dialogue (and dialogue only) between main characters
Ilsa and Rick. Secondly, we look at all of the text in chapters 9 to 12 of the
novel, Madame Bovary. In both studies, we used the same methodology, i.e.
cross-tabulation of word sets, comprising the entire universe of discourse, and
including function and grammar words that characterized textual “texture”.
We ﬁnd the latter to be very useful for expression of emotion.

Figure 2 displays the evolution of sentiment, expressed by (or proxied by) the
terms “kiss”, “tenderness”, and “happiness”. We see that some text segments
are more expressive of emotion than are other text segments.

We now brieﬂy describe another study of both quantitative and qualitative

analysis.

A particular narrative pattern is at issue now, arising out of a social media
case study, and motivated by J¨urgen Habermas’s Theory of Communicative
Action (Theorie des kommunikativen Handelns). For impact of actions, here
based on initiating tweets on Twitter, related to environmental issues, this is
considered as: semantic distance between the initiating action, and the net
aggregate outcome. This can be statistically modelled and tested.

Figure 3 (Murtagh et al., 2016), shows the 8 tweets that initiated the cam-
paigns, and the net aggregate campaigns, given by the centres of gravity of
the 8 campaigns. We see that campaigns 3, 5, 8 have initiating tweets that
are fairly close to the net overall campaign in these cases. By looking at all
tweets, and all terms, it is seen that the campaign initiating tweets, and the
overall campaign means, are close to the origin, i.e. the global average. That
just means that they (respectively, initiating tweets, and means) are relatively
unexceptional among all tweets. While the information that we ﬁnd in our data
is very faint, nonetheless we have an excellent visualization of this information,
that we further analyze, quantitatively.

A further study is at issue, next, with a far larger Twitter data source.
In Murtagh (2016), we are concerned with social and community aspects
of cultural festivals. Our data is about 12 million Twitter tweets, in the time
period, May to December 2015. (Further data will be analysed by us in the
future.) Included are such events as the following: Cannes Film Festival (13–24
May 2015); F`eis `Ile, Isle of Islay (Scotland) Festival (23–31 May 2015); Berlin
Film Festival (19–21 May 2015); CMA, Country Music Association (Nov. 2015);
Yulin Dog (June 2015); and Avignon Theatre Festival (4–25 July 2015). In our

6

Figure 2: A low value of the emotion, expressed by the words “kiss”, “happiness”
and “tenderness”, implies small distance to the text segment. The chronology
of sentiment tracks the closeness of these diﬀerent sentimental terms relative to
the narrative, represented by the text segment. Terms and text segments are
vectors in the semantic, factorial space, and the full dimensionality of this space
is used.

centres of gravity of the campaigns, i.e. the net aggregate of the campaigns, are
labelled “C1” to “C8”. In each case, the tweet initiating the campaign is linked
with an arrow to the net aggregate of the campaign. The percentage inertia
explained by the factors, “Dim 1” being factor 1, and “Dim 2” being factor 2,
is noted. This was also studied in the full, factor space, dimensionality.

initial exploratory analyses, the critical Twitter debate in regard to the Yulin
Dog Meat Festival meant that Twitter data was quite distinct. So in Figure
4, there is a selection of the other festivals, listed above. A suﬃciently used
word set was derived from the Twitter tweet set. For the data used here, a 5815
word corpus was used, from the 32,507,477 words in the data. Occurrence of
1000 uses of a word was required. Filtering was also carried out of prepositions,
parts of verbs, just some abbreviations or partial words, and non-Roman scripts
including Cyrillic, Chinese, Japanese, and Greek. In what was retained, English,
French and Spanish dominated.

An initial analytics decision to be made is what is the principal set of in-
dividuals or records to be used, with other such objects being supplementary
elements; and similarly, what is the principal attribute or variable or variable
modality set to be used, with other variables being supplementary elements.
Contextual attributes will naturally be supplementary elements. We can have
the following analytics perspective: we use an analytics resolution scale, that
is such that tweets per day are considered. Thus the principal data crosses the
set of 233 days (from 11 May 2015 to 31 December 2015) by the retained word
corpus. That is under investigation in Murtagh (2016).

nated by (contribution to the axis inertia) the Avignon Theatre festival, factor 2
is dominated by the Nashville, Tennessee, Country Music Association, factor 3 is
dominated by the Berlin ﬁlm festival. Word projections are shown as dots, just
indicating the semantic density. (The numbers of occurrences of these festival
names, which could have multiple occurrences in a single tweet, and certainly
possibly lots of occurrences in a day’s tweets, are: Cannes, 1,615,550; Avignon,
102,499; CMA, 9407; Berlin, 5557; and `Ile, 1998.) The months, 5 being May, 6
being June, and so on, until 12 being December, are displayed as supplementary
elements.

In order to look in an exploratory way at country names used in the Twitter
data, a set of names was selected. This included, just to see if there were a
distinction, England and Britain.
In the lower right panel in Figure 4, it is
interesting how the semantics here, i.e. the Twitter social media sourcing, and
also taking the principal factor coordinates, factors 1, 2, results in Austria and
Finland, and then Ireland, being similar here.

4 Towards Behaviour and Activity Analytics, for
Mental Health, Depression, and Lifestyle An-
alytics

We are using Euclidean geometry for semantics of information. In the referenced
articles, in previous sections, we used hierarchical topology for other aspects of
semantics, and in particular how a hierarchy expresses anomaly or change. A
further useful case is when the hierarchy respects chronological or other sequence
information. In our view, analytics based on Bourdieu’s work, based on MCA,
Multiple Correspondence Analysis, (encompassing e.g. ﬁeld, homology, habitus,
etc.)
should be a main analytics approach in many current areas of work,
including smarter cities, analytics of Internet of Things, security and forensics
(including trust and identity), Big Data, etc.

It is noted in Kleinman et al. (2016) how relevant and important mental
health is, given the integral association with physical health. From Kleinman et
al. (2016) there is the following: “... parity between mental and physical health
conditions remains a distant ideal”. “The global economy loses about $1 trillion
every year in productivity due to depression and anxiety”. “Next steps include
... integration of mental health into other health and development sectors”.

In Cooper et al. (2016), page 4, under the heading of “Five Ways to Wellbe-
ing”, reference is made to “mental capital and wellbeing”. On page 14, a section
is entitled “The ‘mental capital’ values of the outdoors”.

5 Mental Health: Adult Psychiatric Morbidity

Survey, England, 2007

A periodic survey of mental health, HSCIC (2009), is used. There are 1704
variables, including questioning of the subjects about symptoms and disorders,
psychoses and depression characteristics, anti-social behaviours, eating charac-
teristics and alcohol consumption, drug use, and socio-demographics, including
gender, age, educational level, marital status, employment status, and region
lived in.

As a ﬁrst analysis, the following variables were selected: 14 questions, hence
14 categorical variables, relating to “Neurotic symptoms and common mental
disorders”. These are described in HSCIC (2009, Appendix C). Almost all of
these variables had as question responses, whether or not there were symptoms
or disorders in the past week, one question related to one’s lifetime, and one
question related to the age of 16 onwards. Another question set was selected,

10

origin. Displayed are the 6 highest contributing variables.

relating to socio-demographic variables, noted in the foregoing paragraph. In
this set of socio-demographic variables, there were 9 variables.

An initial display of the neurotic symptoms and common mental disorders,
see Figure 5, sought to have socio-demographic variables as supplementary. But
these were projected close to the origin, therefore showing very little diﬀerenti-
ation or explanatory relevance for the symptoms and disorders data.

In Figure 5, it is found that factor 1 is explained as PTSDcom, “Trauma
screening questionnaire total score” versus all other variables. Factor 2 is ex-
plained as “CISRFOUR” versus “nosymp”. These are, respectively, “CIS-R
score in four groups, 0-5, 6-11, 12-17, 18 and over. (CIS-R = Common Mental
Disorders questionnaire)”; and no neurotic symptoms in the past week.

Next, Figure 6, it was sought to characterize the socio-demographic data,
and then to see if the neurotic symptoms and common mental disorders data
could be explanatory and contextual for the socio-demographic data. But no
diﬀerentiation was found for these supplementary variables, indicating no par-
ticular explanatory capability in this particular instance.

It may be just noted how, in Figures 5 and 6, the main and supplemen-
tary variables were interchanged. Respectively, the symptoms and demographic

variables were main and supplementary; then the main and supplementary vari-
ables were the demographic variables and symptoms. This was done in order to
explore the data.

In Figure 6, factor 1 is seen to have age and education level counterposed
to home region. Factor 2 is seen to have educational level counterposed to:
employment status, gender, marital status, ethnicity.
(In the paragraph to
follow, the names of some of these variables are explained.)

Finally, it was checked whether neurotic symptoms and common mental dis-
orders data should be jointly analysed with the socio-demographic data. Figure
7 shows this outcome. On the positive ﬁrst factor, what is particularly im-
portant, from the contribution to the inertia, is PTSDcom, “TSQ (Trauma
Screening Questionnaire) total score”. The negative second factor, is highly
inﬂuenced by these two variables: “gor06”, “newsha”, respectively: “Govern-
ment oﬃce region” and “Strategic Health Authorities”. These were both sets
of geographic regions in England, respectively 9 and 10. (The 7th such region
in each of these variables was London.)

One aim that we have in future work is to see if we can formulate forms and
expressions of “mental capital”. This concept was noted in section 4 where an

example of it was going for a walk, therefore taking exercise, in the countryside
or parkland.

A summary, and preliminary, interpretation derived from Figure 7 is how
factor 1 accounts for recorded trauma, and factor 2 accounts for region of the
respondent.

6 Conclusions

In this work, we have sought to provide perspectives and focus for the analytics
of behaviours and activities. These can be related to individuals, and to social
groupings or collectivities. We will, in such analytics, work towards responding
to the problem of bias in big data sampling and related representativity. We
also seek to bridge the data with decision-making information. In the sense of
the latter, we are bridging data analytics with position-taking.

Procedurally, the following can be noted. Methodology and implementation
are quite integral to the analytics described here. This is counterposed to having
methods used as “black boxes”, which was a term used, occasionally, in the

In this work, there is direct relationship also with psycho-analytical issues,
with the same geometric and topological data analytics for the bi-logic that
is manifested by the integral human reasoning and thought processes, both
conscious and unconscious. For background on this, and case studies, detailing
the Correspondence Analysis platform, and ultrametric (hierarchical) topology
that is central to unconscious thought processes, see Murtagh (2014).
