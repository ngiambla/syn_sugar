ABSTRACT
Future health ecosystems demand the integration of emerg-
ing data technology with an increased focus on preventive
medicine. Cybernetics extracts the full potential of data to
serve the spectrum of health care, from acute to chronic prob-
lems. Building actionable cybernetic navigation tools can
greatly empower optimal health decisions, especially by quan-
tifying lifestyle and environmental data. This data to decisions
transformation is powered by intuitive event analysis to of-
fer the best semantic abstraction of dynamic living systems.
Achieving the goal of preventive health systems in the cyber-
netic model occurs through the ﬂow of several components.
From personalized models we can predict health status using
perpetual sensing and data streams. Given these predictions
we give precise recommendations to best suit the prediction
for that individual. To enact these recommendations we use
persuasive technology in order to deliver and execute targeted
interventions.

INTRODUCTION
Navigation systems, like Google Maps, became rapidly popu-
lar by providing expert knowledge and real-time personalized
contextual information to guide travel. Personal lifestyle guid-
ance in such a manner does not exist in health care systems. In
order to shift the focus in health systems from temporary ﬁxes
to long-term solutions such a guidance system must be imple-
mented [60] [48]. Commonly, physicians focus primarily on
medical methods to manage health when a patient becomes ill.
By evolutionary design, optimal health is universally desired
(and should be provided) at all times. True health outcomes
result from actions taken in every moment and place, not just
medical intervention during sickness. Future advancements in
health must continuously sense individual needs and rapidly
provide the relevant resources so corrective actions ensure
health stability. For example, optimal health for chronic dis-
eases like type 2 diabetes (T2D) remains a challenge. Insulin

predictive and precision medicine through persuasion techniques that
result in disease prevention.

Figure 2. Cybernetic Control pairs the individual user and digital health
assistance to enact real-world changes to optimize health

resistance, obesity and other biological changes that lead to un-
controlled T2D start many years before a formal diagnosis and
treatment plan is given. These biological changes can be re-
versed by lifestyle choices. If insulin resistance is caught early
in a prediabetic state, the course of the disease is potentially re-
versible [56]. Although biological scientiﬁc understanding has
greatly progressed in the past few decades, diabetes and other
lifestyle associated diseases continue to rapidly rise across the
globe. Given this progress in research, we would expect the
opposite. Historically, monitoring lifestyle factors has been
difﬁcult, and computational power with effective methods to
address the needs of each individual have been limited. Try-
ing to produce changes in routine lifestyle habits is also a
tremendous psychological hurdle.

This work targets three signiﬁcant problems in current health
care delivery through a cybernetic approach. First: Health sys-
tems largely react to problems, rather than avoiding problems
through preventive measures. Second: Gold-standard medi-
cal practices depend on evidence-based medicine taken from
population averages. A lack of individual contextual analysis
results in compromised care and sub-optimal outcomes. Third:
Access to medical guidance is limited due to poor informa-
tion dissemination, and restricted physical time and space. If
doctors give lifestyle suggestions to patients, they are hard to
translate into everyday life decisions. When a need or ques-
tion arises for health advice, such as "What should I eat?" or
"Should I take this medicine now or later?", there is a large
time delay to receive meaningful assistance. Patients usually
scramble for unreliable information via web search engines
when faced with such decisions. The difﬁculty of scaling
physical systems, like hospitals and personnel, further limits
high quality care. This is especially the case for under-served
populations across the globe.
P5 Cybernetic Health (P5C) transforms these three major hur-
dles into opportunities (Figure 1). First: By analyzing individ-
ual data with context, we can predict problems as they arise
and give the best solutions. In the instance of diabetes, we
begin to predict an increase in insulin resistance risk factors
for increasing complications. This leads to actionable informa-
tion for the patient. Second: We tackle the issue of traditional
"evidence-based" medicine by combining sub-population and
individual data dynamically into a system to give "enhanced
real-time personalized evidence-based" medicine unique for
each patient. For a diabetic patient, we give speciﬁc actions
that would result in the best blood glucose management. Third:
We reduce the delay of health advice through real-time sen-
sors and speciﬁc feedback guidance loops, while retaining
the ability to scale to millions of patients through a virtual
platform.

CYBERNETIC PRINCIPLES
Cybernetic principles transformed the design of complex sys-
tems [80]. Continuous measurements are a key component
in closed loop feedback control systems. Airplanes, ovens,
and other machines use these feedback loops to safely and
efﬁciently operate. Imagine if the thermometer in an oven
gave a reading once every year. How would the oven know
to heat or turn off? The thermometer, heater, and other com-
ponents of the oven must all be coordinated and continuously
working for the machine to operate correctly. Similarly, the
human body maintains homeostasis amongst a remarkable
array of perturbations. Biological systems use an intricate play
of real-time sensors and actuators within the body to do this.
Cellular sensors collect personalized information based on the
individual body or tissue changes. These signals affect outputs
for corrective action, and are especially effective if early warn-
ing signs are detected. These cybernetic mechanisms keep the
human body naturally stable.
Occasionally, this human system becomes unstable which re-
sults in deteriorating health. With current day medical practice,
the detection and corrective actions are greatly delayed, re-
sulting in further unstable systems and further deteriorating

health for the patient. Our vision is to reduce this latency of
the health care system, by using continuous sensors that are
speciﬁc to the individual, while enabling corrective actions to
transform an unstable health condition back to full health sta-
bility. In the operating room, anesthesiologists are beginning
to develop closed-loop drug administration systems that will
replace much of their own job during a surgery [59].
For type 1 diabetics, mechanical devices can replace the bio-
logical pancreas with a hormone pump and continuous glucose
monitoring. Both of these examples are mechanical implemen-
tations of cybernetics for health. Unique to our platform, we
begin to mesh real world information into a virtual environ-
ment that patients can use to peek into their live health status
with persuasive guidance for optimal decision making. We
call an application of this Health-Butler (HB).
We chose to implement HB for T2D for two key reasons. First,
diabetes is an increasing global health problem, with almost
double the disease burden in the last 30 years that reaches 8.5
percent of global population. It is a leading cause of blindness,
kidney failure, heart attacks, stroke and lower limb amputation
[14]. Second, T2D and the resulting complications are largely
preventable if corrective action is taken promptly. These cor-
rective measures are actionable by individuals through lifestyle
factors such as nutrition, physical activity, stress management,
and environmental exposure. By continuously monitoring the
aforementioned factors, we can predict if the human system
will start deviating from the homeostatic set point, allowing
HB to intervene at the right time and place.

P5 Cybernetic Health Concept
Leading medical professionals have advocated for integrating
more technology into health care [72]. Future health care
systems will intertwine lifestyle data with medical knowledge
to develop a new paradigm that optimizes individual health.
We have developed a 5 component system to bring this vision
to reality.
First, we use a multi-layer modeling system to understand how
to build an increasingly accurate personalized model. Second,
using this dynamic model connected with real time sensors
allows us to predict evolving situations that an individual may
encounter. Third, we use the predictions in conjunction with
validated expert medical knowledge to give the most precise
solutions to avoid emerging problems. Fourth, we effectively
persuade the individual as an actuator in the system by op-
timizing their preferences, convenience, and speciﬁc health
needs. Fifth, we give feedback on how the patient’s actions
have quantitatively affected their health. The realization of this
personalized, predictive, precise, persuasive, and preventive
system depends upon the coordination of available and future
technologies. We call this above approach P5C (Figure 1).

RELATED WORK
Clinical and medical research in personalized and preventive
medicine struggles to gain traction. Patients continue to re-
ceive sparse feedback on how to best face disease burdens in
their unique daily life circumstances. Medications prevail as
the primary tool to manage diabetes, because they are easy
to physically scale and have standardized instructions for all

2

patients. Currently, live exchange of personalized feedback
from physical human(doctor) to human(patient) on lifestyle
changes, although beneﬁcial, is extremely costly in time and
resources.[61]
There is a signiﬁcant demand for this type of virtual plat-
form. Patients have a much higher probability of making
better lifestyle choices that would combat diabetes if given
guidance [63]. Unfortunately, modern (2016) smartphone
tracking applications have not shown any beneﬁt in improving
glucose control [58]. Physicians continue to vocalize this void
in matching glycemic patterns with lifestyle history [28].
Health monitoring research has quickly grown with pervasive
computing methods. There are some research groups who have
focused on lifestyle monitoring of diabetic patients. Smart-
phones have been used for data collection (e.g. GPS, wiﬁ,
activity) to power machine learning and symbolic reasoning
to recognize lifestyle activities of diabetic patients [44]. Daily
life data of diabetic pregnant women has been integrated with
their network of health care institutions [4]. Other groups have
focused on health-related data monitoring for chronic disease
care. Waki et al. implemented a smartphone self-management
system which consisted of 4 modules; 1) data transmission,
2) evaluation, 3) communication, and 4) dietary evaluation,
which resulted in improved HbA1c in 3 months [77]. Mukher-
jee et al. provided an environment for caregivers to monitor
patient data in real-time [52]. Katz et al. and Mamykina et al.
designed mobile systems to merge and analyze data streamed
from multiple sensors to give user recommendations [38, 45].
Banos et al. explored existing personalized health data ap-
plications to develop a framework, called Mining Minds, to
assimilate health data in order to better serve patients [5]. How-
ever, to the best of our knowledge, there is no joint research
between medical and computing ﬁelds that cover the scope of
cybernetics to coordinate the elements of personalized, predic-
tive and precision medicine through persuasion techniques to
result in disease prevention (Figure 1).
Computing work in this ﬁeld has primarily focused on giving
the user ﬁgures and statistics of past data. This is true for both
hardware and software in personal health. Hardware such as
the Fitbit, and health software like Apple’s HealthKit only
function to acquire and accumulate data. This does not fulﬁll
the function of providing timely and personalized health ad-
vice in a predictive manner. Most importantly current digital
health mechanisms are rudimentary in detecting context for
each individual. Second, recommendation engines that are
used in health applications ignore mechanisms to maintain
retention and trust of the user. Users quickly get alert fatigue
from poor recommendations. To sustain users, applications
must give users autonomy, cater to their desires and conve-
nience, while also informing them in an encouraging man-
ner. Additionally, many lifestyle data parameters are gathered
through manual mechanisms. For example, popular nutrition
tracking applications ask users to manually enter information.
This further causes a high loss in user retention, while having
poor accuracy of input values [40]. Users desire low data entry
burden, with high functionality to help reach their goals [40].

Figure 3. Cybernetic systems apply in all time scales of health from acute
to chronic diseases. Here are just a few examples of components that can
have both acute and chronic effects on health homeostasis. Other than
genetics, most of these factors are controllable to some degree.

HEALTHBUTLER APPLICATION
To illustrate the delivery of P5C through HB, we describe how
a T2D patient named "Bruce Uberschweet", uses the system
to optimally manage his health condition in both positive
and negative scenarios. This will include analysis to better
control blood sugars and reduce drug dependency through
improved metabolism [49]. Bruce is looking for lunch on his
commute to work on Monday and knows that HB always gives
him the fastest access point to tasty and nutritious food. An
intelligent recommendation engine takes into consideration his
real-time personal tastes, logistical convenience, and current
health needs to provide him a curated list of speciﬁc dishes
that he can easily pre-order. He can also clearly see how each
dish affects his diabetes so he can feel empowered to choose
what is good for himself (Figure 4). After attending a wedding
on Sunday, HB predicts a rising insulin resistance based on
his previous lifestyle data, and gives him immediate actions to
take in order to address the worsening condition. It simpliﬁes
his next steps such as booking an urgent appointment with his
doctor to change his medication dose (Figure 4). These are two
examples of how HB is actively engaged in predicting Bruce’s
health status, merging in with his daily life in an unobtrusive
and useful way. Bruce can actively see how his external world
and internal body are interacting through HB.

P5 CYBERNETIC SYSTEM FRAMEWORK
Producing the exemplary application of HB requires the coor-
dination of multiple modules in the P5C system. Each compo-
nent is integrated into the system architecture in (Figure 5) to
produce the front end user interface of HB.

Objective Self (OS) began to build a comprehensive human
model using heterogeneous data sources for each individual
[31].

Figure 6. As data availability increases over time, we are able to build
more accurate models of individuals. In ancient times, anecdotal oral
and diary traditions documented life. With increasingly quantitative
data we can build increasingly accurate models of human life.

P5C builds upon these concepts to build a more comprehensive
understanding of an individual. Smartphones can recognize
many events in our daily life [54, 55, 18, 6]. The timeline of
these life events that can be referred to as a personal chroni-
cle (personicle) [33], and in the near future will be gathered
lifelong, from the ’womb to tomb’. P5C is primarily focused
on changing the lifestyle of a person to bring about clinically
relevant positive health outcomes. Patient data is segregated
into four levels of increasingly personalized rules (Figure 7).
The cybernetic system will target the optimally desired health
state. In the ﬁrst level, we apply universal general rules to
build a skeleton individual based on medical and biological
expert knowledge. Second, we incorporate speciﬁc knowledge
that applies to sub-categories of people, such as, gender, ethnic
background and more. This layer is applied as a function to
the individual at a speciﬁc time and place. Third, we take into
consideration ﬁrm variables about the person, such as genetics,
age, home location, socioeconomic status etc. Fourth, we build
dynamic individual models using the above three rule layers
in addition to an event mining platform that ingests individual
sensor data in real-time. The fourth layer captures the user’s
personicle based on life activities, food intake, medical and
physiological parameters, emotional status and environmental
conditions to build the live user OS. In the future, additional
data streams can easily be incorporated into this data mining
platform.

ActivitySense
Lifelogging through sensors makes it possible to record the to-
tality of an individual’s experiences [29]. Personalized lifelog
raw data is then extracted by HB to semantic-level activities
in real-time. These real-time events allow for intuitive anal-
ysis of a dynamic human life. Life activity events for health
computation are parallel to objects in a picture for intelligent
visual computing. To build realistic systems, we can never
completely capture everything due to the lack of standard data
formats and the complexity of life [62]. Therefore, the range of
our semantic activity also needs to be reﬁned in some number

needs, and available resources. Center: Easy one-touch food and mood
tracking. Right: real-time health status is shown, with direct actions to
take for help.

A. Personalization
Allopathic medicine provides solutions based on averages
from large clinical trials. This method improved population
health dramatically in the last century, but is now hitting a
bottleneck. Various diseases are on the rise despite the latest
advances in biomedical science. Physicians and researchers
do not have the capacity to maintain and analyze detailed
records for every individual. With the recent advances in
sensors, smartphones, and pervasive technology, it is becom-
ing possible to record data to create a digital imprint of each
user,resulting in the concept of quantiﬁed self [66]. For exam-
ple, mobile applications such as Google Fit, Moves [51], or
Fitbit, are actively recording user life data. Dey et al. started
building a conceptual framework, named Context Toolkit and
AWARE, for developing quantiﬁed self applications that un-
derstand context [13, 18]. Creating individual models became
the next logical step in personalized systems. For example,

4

item from HB, it is automatically recorded into the system,
with no extra user burden. On a broader scale, this decision
making support shifts consumers towards healthier menus, and
persuades businesses to offer healthier food options. [78, 47]

MoodSense
This measures the user’s mood at a particular time. Relating
this to life events is vital for making effective recommenda-
tions based on what the user enjoys or dislikes (described in
later sections). We get an estimate of the user’s emotional
state using two types of inputs: 1. Active/Explicit input al-
lows the user to directly mark a moment or an event on their
timeline with their emotional state (Figure 4). We can use
this application to correlate the emotional state with events
(co occurring and delayed) and if the correlation is signiﬁcant
then we can associate that emotional state with the events.
2. Passive/Implicit input allows us to monitor the emotional
state of the user by keeping track of their various interactions
with environment and people. This includes their social media
content and text communication. Similar emotion detection
studies show strong promise with these methods [71, 25].

MedicalSense
Incorporating medical data into OS is essential to make in-
formed health decisions. For diabetic patients, we collect
blood glucose values through bluetooth glucose meters, their
medication compliance with bluetooth pill boxes, and their
pre-existing health conditions data from the hospital electronic
health records. As continuous glucose monitoring becomes
technologically advanced, patients will be able to report their
blood sugar values without any invasive interventions [2].

EnviroSense
Environmental factors continuously affect the health of every
individual. Having the ability to measure the local environ-
ment of each individual, we will give insight into how they
are being affected by factors the user is otherwise unaware
of. In diabetes, air and water pollution have been shown to
increase the risk of diabetes [15, 9, 16, 7]. Long term exposure
to particulate matter in the air can activate pathophysiological
responses that can induce insulin resistance [9, 17]. While
public data regarding the quality of the environment is readily
available, it is not incorporated and tracked at the individual
level.
We are using an open source software platform, called
EventShop to ingest and assimilate different data streams [57,
67, 64]. It combines different environmental data streams
ranging from climate data, air quality, pollen counts, and
micro-blogs (like Instagram and Twitter) to understand how
the environment is evolving. For each individual, the envi-
ronment stream will be stored by obtaining this information
from EventShop. Additionally, we use available data from
open-sources such as Yelp, Google Maps, and government
websites to understand what resources are available to a user
at any given location and time. These data sources will be used
in the need-to-resource matching for daily life such as food
suggestions, activity recommendations, emergency hospital
directions and more.

Figure 7. We integrate increasingly personalized layers of data modeling
to build an objective self.

of meaningful activities rather than recognizing all possible
things. Quantitative information of time use, frequency, inten-
sity of stress, enjoyment, and other affective states are most
meaningful to medical researchers [37]. HB currently targets
17 standard semantic level activities which include: socializ-
ing, relaxing, prayer, eating, exercising, home events(watching
TV, preparing food, sleeping, housework), shopping, conver-
sations, computer/e-mail/Internet usage, working, commuting,
and important diabetes-related activities, such as the use of the
toilet and hospital visits. High blood sugar increases urination
frequency in diabetic patients.
Some research groups have been working on semantic-based
life event recognition. Routinely visited locations such as
home, work, or school can be tracked and these can indicate
pursued activities such as leisure, working, or traveling [41].
Contextual information can be processed together to infer
everyday activities on a high level such as eating, cooking,
walking, or talking etc [79]. Mobile Lifelogging tracks activity
[51, 19] but also detects high-level life events [42, 54].

FoodSense
Patients suffering from obesity, diabetes, cardiac disease and
other chronic conditions continue to have difﬁculty following
nutritional guidelines. Primary reasons include the failure to
address individual differences, resources planning, and high
burden of manual data entry [53]. A quantitative diary of
food intake may be helpful in regulating dietary habits, but
this type of a system is still not pervasive [11]. Patients that
measure food in conjunction with glucose and insulin only
see a slight beneﬁt [23]. An essential requirement is to have
a personalized and objective approach that requires minimal
user input. Many companies and researchers try to encourage
people to manually enter information whenever they eat. The
"Accu-Chek 360" by Roche uses 7 glucose time points a day
for 3 days and has been shown to only be slightly beneﬁcial to
clinicians and in most cases, however, only partial qualitative
information was reported. FoodSense captures and analyzes
photos or transactions of food to create a quantitative nutrition
diary along with emotions in one touch. Using these pictures
we use open deep-learning techniques by Google and Clarifai
for food recognition in photos [10]. Nutritional parameters
for each person are analyzed based on their personal health
status [28, 81] to give them the most relevant suggestions
on guidance. Bruce receives his lunch recommendations on
HB from this analysis, in conjunction with all his other data
(Figure 4). For example, Bruce exercised before he received
his nutritional recommendations which gave him options that
are suited for glycogen replenishment. When he purchases the

5

We can create a behavior proﬁle for the user with the input
from the above modules, which can be referred to as habit
waveform.
The habit waveform represents a user’s behavior averaged
over a large period of time, and it is continuously affected by
the person’s actions and environment. We can view this as a
control system where the habit waveform represents a person’s
equilibrium or steady state and all the events can be viewed
as an impulse provided to the system. Our goal is to modify
the steady state over a period of time to a conﬁguration known
to represent healthier lifestyle and minimize the effects of the
events/impulses which are detrimental to the health of the user.

B. Prediction
We use data driven analysis and pattern mining algorithms
to ﬁnd event patterns in a personicle to build individual OS
models. These models estimate and predict how future events
will affect the habits waveform and variables of interest.
Event relationship operators formulate compound events and
compute co-occurrences which are then tested with a new
set of data [32, 34, 36]. This framework extends traditional
complex event processing [8] signiﬁcantly by including space,
multiple event streams, with point and interval events to enable
real world data analysis.
In using the event based computational paradigm, our analysis
follows very intuitively from raw data to events to situations,
which can be directly related to physiological measurements
(Figure 8). Thus we are extracting live raw data to ﬁnd a direct
relationship between events of the user and their physiolog-
ical condition (situations). This allows for clinically valid
interpretations that feed into the recommendation engine.
Merged event streams in a personicle [33] produce a stream of
time-indexed events, e.g., high fat meal eaten at 3pm Monday
or 40 minutes of exercise at 2pm on Saturday or high blood
glucose level at 5pm Thursday. Statistical models [30] are
used to identify recurring patterns in a sequence of events.
By ﬁtting such models it is possible to identify sequences of
events that may predict high likelihood of an adverse medi-
cal event. Fitting the model to an individual’s event stream
data is a challenge that may require weeks of observations.
Bayesian hierarchical models [27] can be used to leverage
information from a population of users to give upfront mean-
ingful analysis until the data from a single user is sufﬁcient.
This approach provides an intuitive data-determined degree of
synergistic sharing between individual and population infor-
mation. Parameters of models that ﬁt separate individuals can
be described by a population distribution where recurring pat-
terns are shared while some remain unique to each individual
[30].
Essentially, our system initially provides strong population
data driven assistance while becoming increasingly personal-
ized as data accumulates. We can also use these event patterns
to identify the food preferences of a person. Clustering and
factor analysis are used to identify eating habits using em-
pirical methods[1] in addition to using deﬁned diet quality
scores[76]. In the example of diet, once we have identiﬁed
the preferences that are relevant, we create the personalized

semantics to the raw data. Situations give a cognitive understanding of
the current and past states. We use this to predict future states of the
system.

food habit waveform to illustrate the degree to which a user
consumes particular food groups. Similar analysis is done
for activities as well which gives us the historical habits of
the person. Life habits coupled with the MoodSense data
identiﬁes preferred activities. For example, the person may
be stuck in trafﬁc everyday while commuting to work (a life
habit), but using the emotional response we can ascertain they
do not prefer waiting in trafﬁc. User preference prediction
identiﬁes activities/food items which are most likely to be
executed. We focus this prediction to trigger positive changes
in the user’s health. As we will see in the persuasive aspect of
the system, food events/activities which have a positive impact
on the user’s health and satisfy the above constraints are the
most appropriate suggestions for the user.
Aside from this, we can use the event history of the user to
identify anomalies in their behavior. Some of these anoma-
lies may represent medically signiﬁcant behavior changes, for
example if we can identify sudden mood shifts using Mood-
Sense, there is a high likelyhood of hyper or hypoglycemia.
This activates the system to provide emergency relief services.
We also use the personalized data to predict developing insulin
resistance over time. An accumulation of low activity, high fat
and sugar foods, with associated lethargy indicates the individ-
ual is not on track to improve their glucose sensitivity. After
Bruce’s attended the wedding on Saturday, a combination of
these factors trigger the alert and actions based on a predicted
increase in insulin resistance (indicated a deteriorating diabetic
condition) (Figure 4).

C. Precision
A lack of data on personal lifestyle in relation to biomarkers
has been a struggle in the quest to provide the most precise
treatments for patients [75]. President Barack Obama also
began the Precision Medicine Initiative to begin following var-
ious cohorts of patients to understand what constitutes better
treatments for some over others [21]. Researchers are also
trying to link genetic factors to diabetes outcomes, but they
are confounded in their research due to a lack of high ﬁdelity
lifestyle data [73].
By predicting the probability of physiologic events, we can
send the most appropriate control signals to the user to take
corrective action to maintain their health status before it starts

6

becoming unstable. We develop an algorithm that incorpo-
rates various factors such as the severity of the adverse event
along with the likelihood of occurrence. To prevent alarm
fatigue, we dispatch the control signal only after the threshold
of maintaining optimal health is crossed. Precise diagnostic
tools, medications and other medical interventions are also
suggested to the physician as to reduce waste of resources and
ensure better outcomes. Most importantly, giving the most
precise treatment for an individual relies on the generation of
actionable interventions [75]. To produce effective changes
in diabetes status, glycemic patterns need to be accurately
related to a continuously monitored lifestyle [28]. This al-
lows for a clear understanding of how different factors affect
a patient’s blood glucose. Early lifestyle corrections are a
primary method to prevent microvascular complications of
diabetes, but include potential non-intuitive actions such as
having a moderate amount of alcohol in the diet [75] or switch-
ing to a ﬂexitarian diet (reduced meat intake) [12]. Speciﬁc
exercises improve insulin resistance over others, especially
aerobic training over resistance training [75] [46]. Certain
patients are at higher risk of hypoglycemia from medications,
and thus may have a less stringent glucose target to prevent
severe hypoglycemic episodes, while also needing to be more
informed of potential factors that may cause hypoglycemia
[82]. Furthermore, exercising to lose weight is not necessarily
the best therapy for poor glucose control [22]. Some clinical
testing methods, such as monoﬁlament testing, to check for
diabetic peripheral neuropathy can also be easily executed
by family or friends near to the patient. P5C uses a host of
veriﬁed medical data in conjunction with physicians to direct
precise diagnostic, treatment or control actions [74]. HB will
suggest these actions in addition to prompting a doctors visit
when predicted glucose control and insulin resistance from
lifestyle data is not in the normal range (Figure 4. We deliver
these non-intuitive signals to the user to take action via HB.
Ultimately, merging individual quantiﬁed models with expert
knowledge, translation of medical research to help the unique
case of each individual is accelerated.

D. Persuasion
A 2016 review of modern smart phone food tracking has not
shown beneﬁts for glucose control [58]. This highlights the
need for considering the user’s preferences while making rec-
ommendations. The incentives also need to be aligned for the
patient to take positive actions [28]. The goal of our system is
to induce gradual habit changes via suggestions which cater
to user’s preferences and cause incremental improvements in
their long term habits and health. Recommendations are a
cost function of preferences along with health impact. Healthy
options which are diametrically opposite to the person’s pref-
erences have a high cost as the user is unlikely to act on the
suggestions. Thus we align their preferences by inducing
minimal changes which are good for their health (Figure 9).
Concepts from persuasive technology help us in generating
recommendations that are most suited for the individual[24,
3]. According to Fogg’s Behavior Model [20], there are three
factors which determine behavior: motivation, ability and
trigger.

Figure 9. 1. The upper right quadrant of Ability represents options that
are both healthy and preferred for a given user. Natural triggers (such
as hunger) cause an increase in motivation to look for food. 2. As the
motivation increases, the user mobilizes to access resources to fulﬁll the
motivation, generally aligned with their preferences. HB tilts the Ability
to optimize for convenience, preferences and health factors in real-time.
3. As the user is presented with choices, we use a synthetic trigger to
increase the probability of the optimized action.

Motivation refers to the individual’s willingness to follow
through with the suggestion. There are three factors which
can affect motivation for any activity/event:

Preference/Instant gratiﬁcation motivates the events
which the user enjoys and would always prefer to perform
(if the other factors permit it). These recommendations
take into account the user’s preferences, which increases
the probability of follow through for the given suggestion.
This is calculated based on past events similar to the recom-
mendations with a positive emotional response. Goals/Fear
motivate the events which the user doesn’t necessarily like
but are important for achieving a long term goal or to avoid
an outcome. Waiting in trafﬁc while commuting to work
is an example of this type of motivation. These events
can be determined from frequent patterns in event history
and include events which are repeated even regardless of
emotional response. Social/External pressure motivate
the events where external pressure from other people maybe
a factor. This factor controls signiﬁcant portions of social
behavior and hence may inﬂuence the user to pursue activ-
ities which they usually would not pursue. We use social
media connections along with social media activity to un-

7

derstand which events are inﬂuenced by other people or
social groups.

Ability represents the accessibility in performing the sug-
gested behavior. This factor is an interplay of the indi-
vidual’s surroundings and their intrinsic capability. When
ranking the recommendations, we will integrate the infor-
mation about environment from Eventshop (as speciﬁed
in EnviroSense) and the event history of the person. This
will let us know whether the person’s ability and the envi-
ronmental constraints required for the event are satisﬁed or
not, and matches their needs to the available resources. For
example, we would only suggest driving to get a healthy
lunch if Bruce had access to a car (intrinsic capability), and
the trafﬁc conditions (surrounding resources) allowed him
to travel in time for his next meeting.

Triggers are reminders or suggestions personalized to the
individual’s needs to accomplish the task[20]. Two broad
categories of triggers include: 1. Natural triggers from phys-
iological events occurring in the body, such as hunger. 2.
Synthetic triggers are provided by the system and aimed
at facilitating the occurrence of an event. These can be in
form of a notiﬁcation on a smartphone or an intervention
from a friend or relative. Synthetic triggers are synergistic
when coupled with relevant natural triggers. For example,
a notiﬁcation about healthy food options when the person
is hungry. In our system, synthetic triggers in the form of
parsed dish menus are used to enhance the person’s ability
by recommending items which are similar to the person’s
preferred activities but have a positive impact on the user’s
health (in our case, food items similar to what user likes
but comparatively healthier). This helps us match the user’s
needs to the available resources and generate recommenda-
tions which meet the criteria of the behavior model. Bruce’s
lunch menu on HB follows from this analysis (Figure 4).

The variance in recommendations are calibrated based on the
different types of events in the user’s history. HB caters to the
range of events that hover in the vicinity of user event history.
This increases the effectiveness of recommendations.

E. Prevention
By preventing negative outcomes, we accomplish several tasks.
Users are given direct feedback to understand actions they
are taking are working to beneﬁt themselves. This keeps
user motivation up and encourages further participation in
ownership of their own health. Prevention also depends on
informing the individual of risks regarding their choices. In
the USA, calories are printed on menus of large franchise
restaurants by law. This allows consumers to have direct
basic information on what they are consuming. Similarly, the
practice of having cancer warning signs on cigarette packages
or labeling alcohol warnings for pregnant women are designed
to inform the consumer of their choice. HB and any other
system derived from the P5C concept focus on informing the
user in a personalized fashion.
Preventing problems and managing health information bene-
ﬁts quality of life. Morbidity attached to disease management
is a large factor or reduced quality of life. Giving patients

the ability to prevent the progression of their disease has been
shown to improve quality of life [43]. As a bonus, correc-
tive actions through lifestyle factors positively affect multiple
comorbidities at the same time. These interventions reduce
diabetes, dyslipidemia, and prevent cardiovascular disease [39,
50, 39]. Prevention involves early detection from continu-
ous monitoring. Most importantly, earlier diagnosis makes
treatment through lifestyle interventions much more effective.
Continuous monitoring also allows the medical team to mod-
ify treatment more appropriately through tighter coordination.
Ultimately, the prevention of deteriorating health conditions
keeps the individual in the steady state of optimal health. This
is the original goal of cybernetic systems, which aligns per-
fectly with the goals of an optimal health system.

CURRENT STATUS
At the time of writing this project we have several modules
fully working, some under active construction, and a couple
that will begin construction soon (Figure 10). Our functional
active closed-loop system will be ultimately deployed in the
hospital setting. The construction status for the system mod-
ules follows from the integration as follows.
1. Realtime data: Heterogeneous data sources from real-world
events, such as social sources (e.g. Twitter, Facebook
and Flickr), environmental sources (e.g. ﬂood, hurricane,
asthma, ﬂu, population, pollution, and weather), camera,
and trafﬁc etc [26, 57].

2. Eventshop: Providing operators for data stream ingestion,
visualization, integration, situation characterization, and
sending out alerts [65].

3. Resource aggregation: Situation recognition obtaining ac-
tionable insights from observed spatio-temporal data [65,
26, 57, 68, 70].

4. Realtime data: Heterogeneous data sources from human-
related sensor data by smartphone and wearable sensors
(e.g. activity, step, GPS, venue, call, calendar, wiﬁ connec-
tion, smartphone application, photo, ambient light, ambient
sound etc.) [33, 55, 54].

5. Personicle: Identifying semantic-level life events using het-
erogeneous data sources and creating a chronicle of life
events [33, 54].

6. Quantiﬁed model: Comprehensive human model using ob-
jective quality data from heterogeneous data sources for
individuals [31].

7. Evolving situation: Human behavior analysis with causal
modeling across multimedia data streams [34, 32, 36, 35].

8. Matching: Merging environmental situation and personal

situation [67, 69].

9. Recommendation: We are actively engaged in developing a

recommendation engine.

10. Reporting and 11. Expert Knowledge: We will begin inte-

grating this aspect soon.

CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE CHALLENGES
Cybernetic principles lay the foundation of building health
systems that are responsive in keeping individuals at optimal
health over the course of a lifetime. Our conceptual foundation
of P5C is constructed with the most fundamental principles
in control theory while incorporating the ability to seamlessly
integrate both present and future technological advancements.
This is an absolute necessity to transform the archaic practices
of current day health care, especially in light of how many
diseases complications are preventable. The most important
concept we describe is how these parts integrate to form a
true closed-loop system. These closed-loop systems have been
reﬁned in mechanical systems over decades and in biological
systems for millions of years. This also ties together the span
of our health ecosystem to work in synergy. It is absolutely
necessary to use these principles to bridge the virtual and real
world together to move human health forward.
Each individual block of P5C (personalized, predictive, pre-
cision, persuasion, prevention) for HB is under active devel-
opment to be completed for beta testing in patients by March
2017. Real health progress relies on an interdisciplinary effort
between hospital clinicians, engineers, computer scientists,
and bioscience researchers. Our work focuses on the transla-
tion of interdisciplinary academic progress into real systems
that patients will beneﬁt from. HB is just one incarnation of
P5C in a hospital focused application that we are launching
with the UCI Health Diabetes Center and a cornerstone of the
interdisciplinary UCI Institute for Future Health. There will
be various technical challenges during large scale deployment
of any P5C system. Consideration of how various countries
have different habit patterns, regulations, medical systems,
sensor and network connectivity, and environments is essen-
tial. Tackling the reliability of sensor data is essential for
systems like this to properly function. Integration of natural
language processing for medical literature will also improve
the ability to quickly disseminate actionable information to
the masses. Security and privacy are of utmost concern in all
circumstances for patients and providers. These challenges
are constantly being addressed as P5C systems grow.
