KEY POINTS 

 

QUESTION: What are the differences in length of stay (LOS) for trauma inpatients with 
similar age, illness, procedural burden, and insurance type, but were managed by different 
care coordination patterns? 

FINDINGS: In this observational study of 5,588 adult patients (age > 18) hospitalized for 
trauma at a single center between 2013 and 2015, the hospital LOS for the care 
coordination pattern with the highest degree of collaboration was 14 hours shorter than 
other care coordination patterns. 

MEANING: In trauma care, promoting highly collaborative care coordination may reduce 
LOS. 

 

ABSTRACT 

IMPORTANCE: Care coordination can improve efficiency and reduce health care expenditures, 

particularly in trauma settings, where a high-throughput of admissions necessitates communication 

and collaboration between a wide array of healthcare professionals across a range of operational 

areas in the organization. However, at the same time, the complexity of such a setting makes it 

challenging to investigate the relationship between coordination plan and patient outcome.  

OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that variation in care coordination is related to LOS.  

DESIGN  We  applied  a  spectral  co-clustering  methodology  to  simultaneously  infer  groups  of 

patients  and  care  coordination  patterns,  in  the  form  of  interaction  networks  of  health  care 

professionals,  from  electronic  medical  record  (EMR)  utilization  data.  The  care  coordination 

pattern for each patient group was represented by standard social network characteristics and its 

relationship  with  hospital  LOS  was  assessed  via  a  negative  binomial  regression  with  a  95% 

confidence interval.  

SETTING AND PATIENTS This study focuses on 5,588 adult patients hospitalized for trauma 

at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center. The EMRs were accessed by healthcare professionals 

from 179 operational areas during 158,467 operational actions.   

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Hospital LOS for trauma inpatients, as an indicator of care 

coordination efficiency. 

RESULTS: Three general types of care coordination patterns were discovered, each of which was 

affiliated with a specific patient group. The first patient group exhibited the shortest hospital LOS 

and was managed by a care coordination pattern that involved the smallest number of operational 

areas (102 areas, as opposed to 125 and 138 for the other patient groups), but exhibited the largest 

number  of  collaborations  between  operational  areas  (e.g.,  an  average  of  27.1  connections  per 

operational area compared to 22.5 and 23.3 for the other two groups). The hospital LOS for the 

second and third patient groups was 14 hours (P = 0.024) and 10 hours (P = 0.042) longer than the 

first patient group, respectively.  

CONCLUSIONS  AND  RELEVANCE:  The  care  coordination  pattern  with  the  largest  degree  of 

collaboration (e.g., highest connectivity and density) exhibited the shortest LOS. We believe these 

findings  serve  as  evidence  for  opportunities  in  codifying  or  refining  coordination  patterns  for 

trauma patients. 

 

 

Trauma is the most common cause of death in the Western world [1-2] due, in part, to the wide 

variability in the types of injuries and complications to which the patients are subject.  As a result, 

care  coordination  in  trauma  often  involves  interactions  between  a  multidisciplinary  group  of 

healthcare  professionals  (e.g.,  anesthesiologists,  surgeons,  emergency  room  physicians, 

respiratory  therapists,  nurse  practitioners,  radiographers,  neurosurgeons,  and  various  types  of 

nurses)  who  are  distributed  across  time  and  space  [3].  This  type  of  care  coordination  has  been 

shown to generally reduce the time required for resuscitation [3], improve the overall survival rate 

of trauma patients [3-4], and improve the efficiency and cost effectiveness of care [3-5].   

Given  the  potential  for  better  outcomes,  there  is  great  interest  in  optimizing  the  care 

coordination  process  (e.g.,  composition  of  a  trauma  team  and  communication  between  team 

members). Towards this goal, various auditing (e.g., video review, observer review and medical 

notes review) [3, 6], simulation (e.g., simulators who educate team members on communication, 

cooperation  and  leadership)  [7]  and  data-driven  programs  (e.g.,  tools  to  visualize  care  team 

structures) [21-23] have been proposed to assess and refine care coordination processes.  Auditing 

and simulation programs have generally adapted a top-down strategy to design or refine expert-

based care coordination routines, which results in a heavy reliance on the individual healthcare 

professional  and  the  defined  coordination  plans  are  insufficient  to  satisfy  dynamic  changes  in 

healthcare environments [38-41]. Thus, data-driven programs have been proposed to infer dynamic 

care  team  structures  and  communication  patterns  between  team  members  involved  in  a  care 

coordination  process  [11-12,  22-23].  However  such  programs  are  limited  in  that  they  do  not 

investigate  the  relationship  between  these  patterns  and  patient  outcome,  such  as  length  of  stay 

(LOS) [8-9].   

Electronic  medical  record  (EMR)  systems  can  bridge  this  gap,  and  in  many  cases  they  already 

capture  information  sharing,  coordination,  and  documentation  longitudinally,  thus  providing  a 

large quantity of operational activities from a diverse collection of healthcare professionals [13-

14, 22, 26-29]. This type of data has shown promise for inferring healthcare organizational patterns 

[11-12] and analyzing patient outcomes [37]. Thus, in this study we leverage EMR data to infer 

trauma-centered coordination patterns and quantify their relationship with hospital LOS.  

 

 

Methods 

Study Materials 

This  study  focuses  on  5,588  patients  who  were  assigned  to  a  single  center's  trauma  service 

(Vanderbilt University Medical Center) and completed an inpatient stay between 2013 and 2015.  

During  this  period,  5,547  employees,  affiliated  with  179  operational  areas  (e.g.,  mental  health 

center,  neuro  intensive  care  unit,  and  neurosurgery  clinic)  in  the  medical  center,  accessed  the 

EMRs of these patients. This entailed 158,467 unique actions (e.g., uploading a clinical note or 

medication  administration).  These  access  actions  were  relied  upon  to  infer  care  coordination 

patterns (e.g., networks of healthcare employees). 

Our study leverages a single-institution EMR system as a special case to explore trauma-centered 

coordination  patterns  and  quantify  their  relationship  with  hospital  LOS.  This  medical  center 

provides state- and national-verified Level 1 trauma care for a geographic region spanning 65,000 

square  miles  and  handles  over  3,000  acute  trauma  admissions  annually  [10].  Additionally, 

information associated with a patients’ hospitalization, as well as employees’ utilization of such 

information, is documented in a homegrown EMR system that has been central to clinical activities 

since the 1990s [11-13].   

To assess the relationships between care coordination patterns with patient outcomes, we extracted 

hospital  LOS  for  each  patient,  where  LOS  is  measured  as  the  duration  between  admission  and 

discharge of a patient encounter. The mean and media of length of stay was 158 and 160 hours 

respectively. We excluded patients who died during their trauma service to focus on coordination 

patterns  indicative  of  completion  in  hospital  care.  Given  that  LOS  may  also  be  related  with 

additional confounding factors (e.g., patient age, degree of illness, procedure burden and insurance 

type), we extracted and tested the influence such factors for each patient as well.  

The  EMRs  for  the  patients  in  this study  contained  3,612  distinct  International  Classification  of 

Diseases,  Ninth  Version  (ICD-9)  billing  codes,  1,627  distinct  Current  Procedural  Terminology 

(CPT) codes and 8 insurance programs (e.g., Medicaid, Medicare Part A). The minimum, mean 

and maximum patient age was 18, 47 and 100 respectively. 

We acknowledge that ICD-9 codes are insufficient to represent accurate patient illness. To mitigate 

bias  due  to  practices  in  insurance  billing,  we  rely  on  the  phenome-wide  association  study 

(PheWAS)  vocabulary,  which  was  introduced  to  group  ICD-9  codes  together  and  reduce 

variability in the definitions of clinical concepts in secondary data use scenarios [16-17]. Upon 

translating each ICD-9 code, the data consisted of 1,010 PheWAS codes. 

Study Design 

In preparation for this study, we composed a set of cohorts by defining cases (e.g., patients with 

longer LOS) and controls (e.g., patients with shorter LOS). Then, care coordination patterns (e.g., 

networks  of  healthcare employees)  were  inferred  for  cases  and  controls,  respectively,  and  their 

relationship with hospital LOS was examined.   

Given  such  a  design,  it  would  seem  natural  to  investigate  the  influence  of  care  coordination 

patterns  on  differences  in  LOS.  However,  care  coordination  patterns  may  not  be  designed  or 

established  according  to  the  criteria  (e.g.  LOS)  we  leveraged  to  define  the  cases  and  controls.  

Thus,  the  care  coordination  patterns  inferred  from  such  defined  cases  and  controls  may  be 

segments of real coordination and could not represent the exact networks of healthcare employees.   

As a result, we construct cohorts by grouping patients according to inferred coordination patterns. 

This  was  accomplished  by  i)  inferring  the  care  coordination  patterns  and  then  ii)  applying  the 

inferred patterns to compose the cohorts. To do so, patients in each built group will share similar 

care coordination patterns. In this case, it is appropriate to control for care coordination variations 

in each patient group and, thus, ascertain if such variations are related with LOS.  

Our  study  design  consists  of  three  components:  i)  learn  patient  groups  according  to  care 

coordination  patterns;  ii)  quantify  care  coordination  patterns  by  standard  social  network 

characteristics; and iii) assess the relationships between coordination patterns and hospital LOS.  

Grouping Patients By Care Coordination Patterns 

We use a binary matrix A to represent the commitment of healthcare employees’ actions to EMRs. 

Specifically, the value of a cell A(i,j) is 1 if a healthcare worker i committed an action to the EMR 

of patient j and 0 otherwise. We will leverage information in A to derive care coordination patterns 

and patient groups. However, it has been shown that care coordination patterns inferred at a level 

of operational areas are more stable and interpretable than patterns learned at the level of healthcare 

employees [11,18].  Thus, we transform A into a new matrix 𝐴′, where each cell stores the number 

of actions that all healthcare employees from a specific operational area committed to a patient’s 

EMR.  

Since, a patient record is usually worked on by a small subset of the healthcare employees, 𝐴′  is 

a  sparse  matrix.  We  apply  a  spectral  co-clustering  model  to 𝐴′ to  uncover  groups  of  patients 

according to their coordination patterns. We rely on this method because it has been shown to be 

robust  in  high-dimensional  sparse  matrices  [2-3].  Patients  who  share  similar  care  coordination 

patterns were grouped via a spectral co-clustering model [15, 24-25]. This methodology employs 

matrix  decomposition  techniques,  and  formalizes  co-clustering  as  a  bipartite  graph  partitioning 

problem [2-3]. The details of the patient grouping process are in Supplement S1. 

Quantifying the Characteristics of Care Coordination Patterns 

To  ascertain  if  variations  in  care  coordination  patterns  were  associated  with  hospital  LOS,  we 

represent each care coordination pattern as a network of operational areas and then quantify the 

networks via social network characteristics.  For each group of patients, we infer a coordination 

pattern, in a network form, to show how healthcare employees coming from these operational areas 

interacted  with  each  other  to  provide  care  for  the  group  of  patients.  Each  node  in  a  network 

corresponds to  an operational  area and  each edge weight of two operational  areas is the  cosine 

similarity  of  interactions  on  patients’  EMR  between  healthcare  professionals  from  these  two 

operational  areas  [30].  The  details  for  the  edge  weighting  process  are  in  Supplement  S1.  We 

define  a  care  coordination  pattern  as  the  network  of  operational  areas  affiliated  with  a  patient 

group.  

We  leverage  standard  social  network  characteristics  to  quantify  each  care  coordination  pattern. 

Specifically,  these  characteristics  correspond  to  average  node  degree,  average  weighted  node 

degree, graph density, clustering coefficient and average path length [31, 34]. The definitions of 

these characteristics are defined as: 

  Average  node  degree:  Calculated  by  summing  the  degree  of  for  each  node  (i.e.,  the 

number of edges connected to it) and dividing by the total number of nodes. 

  Average weighted node degree: Calculated by summing the weighted degree of a node 

(i.e., the sum of weights of edges connected to it) and dividing by the total number of nodes. 

  Graph density: The ratio of the number of edges observed to the number of possible edges. 

  Cluster  coefficient:  The  average  clustering  coefficient  for  all  nodes.  The  cluster 

coefficient of a node is the ratio of existing edges connecting a node's neighbors to each 

other to the maximum possible number of such edges. A high clustering coefficient for a 

network is another indication of a small world phenomena.  

  Average path length: Calculated by summing shortest path lengths between all pairs of 

nodes  and dividing  by the total  number of pairs. This  indicates the  number of steps, on 

average, it takes to move from one node of the network to another.  

Subnetworks may exist within each care coordination pattern, so we further infer communities of 

healthcare  employees.  This  is  accomplished  through  a  heuristic  algorithm  that  optimizes  the 

modularity  of  a  network  [33].  A  high  modularity  indicates  a  dense  connectivity  of  operational 

areas within communities and a sparse connectivity between communities. 

Assessing the Relationship between Care Coordination Patterns and LOS 

We apply a generalized linear regression model with negative binomial distributions [19] to test 

the  influence  of  care  coordination  patterns  on  the  differences  in  LOS  for  each  pair  of  patient 

groups.  The  negative  binomial  distribution  has  been  shown  to  achieve  the  best  performance  to 

transform hospital LOS, whose distribution does not follow a normal distribution [32]. We applied 

an analysis of variance (ANOVA [43]) with a 95% confidence interval to test the significance of 

differences in LOS for pairs of groups.  

We further investigated if the differences in LOS were correlated with the potential confounding 

factors, which we incorporated in the regression models.  This was accomplished by testing for 

differences in the distributions of PheWAS codes, procedural codes, insurance programs and ages 

between each pair of patient groups.  Specifically, for each pair of patient groups, we compare the 

similarity  in  the  distributions  of  the  aforementioned  factors  through  a  Pearson  correlation 

coefficient (PCC) [20]. This similarity score is in the range (-1,1), where a 1 indicates a positive 

direct correlation, 0 indicates no correlation, and a -1 indicates a negative direct correlation. If each 

pair of patient groups exhibits a high PCC with a predefined significance (>95% confidence level) 

for each factor, then we consider them to be sufficiently similar. If a pair of groups exhibit similar 

distributions in terms of these factors, then their corresponding care coordination patterns likely 

handle a similar patient population. This would suggest that the different care coordination patterns 

manage similar patients, but with different hospital LOS.  Further details about this assessment are 

in Supplement S2. 

 

 

Results 

Patient Groups and Care Coordination Patterns 

The co-clustering approach discovered three patient groups, which we refer to as P1, P2, and P3. 

These groups were composed of 428, 1,353, and 3,807 inpatients, respectively.  Additionally, the 

strategy discovered three operational groups, which we refer to as O1, O2, and O3. The relationship 

between the patient and operational groups is depicted as a heatmap in Fig 1(a). In this figure, each 

point  indicates  the  number  of  actions  that  healthcare  workers  from  a  certain  operational  area 

committed  to  a  patient’s  EMR.    Given  that  there  are  179  operational  areas,  we  defer  the 

descriptions for these area to Supplement S3. For each patient group, it can be seen that all three 

operational  groups  are  involved,  but  with  different  care  coordination  patterns  (as  shown  in  Fig 

1(b), 1(c) and 1(d)). 

The care coordination patterns for P1, P2, and P3, are shown in Fig 1(b), 1(c) and 1(d), respectively. 

Each coordination pattern is made up of communities of operational areas which were represented 

with  different  colors  (e.g.,  blue,  green,  red  and  purple).  The  width  of  an  edge  between  two 

operational areas indicates the strength of collaboration between their employees, while the size 

of  a  node  is  proportional  to  the  degree  (connections)  of  that  node.  We  rely  on  connections  to 

emphasize the importance of an operational area within a care coordination pattern.  

Quantified Care Coordination Patterns 

The quantities of network characteristics for care coordination patterns are reported in Table 1. It 

can be seen that the coordination pattern for patient group P1 has the smallest number of operational 

areas  (102),  but  the  highest  amount  of  collaboration  (e.g.,  27.14  average  degree,  7.02  average 

weighted  degree,  0.27  graph  density,  0.77  cluster  coefficient,  and  1.43  average  path  length) 

between employees from these operational areas. There are several notable findings to report here. 

First, the coordination pattern for P1 has the highest average degree (in comparison to coordination 

patterns for P2 and P3), which indicates that healthcare employees in the care coordination pattern 

of P1 have more connections with other team members than employees in the other two patterns. 

Second, the coordination pattern of P1 has the highest graph density and cluster coefficient, which 

demonstrates that there are more interactions and collaborations between team members than the 

other patterns. Third, the coordination pattern of P1 has the shortest average path length, which 

shows  a  pair  of  team  members  in  the  coordination  pattern  tend  to  have  a  more  direct  line  of 

communication than in the other two patterns. 

Relationship between Coordination Patterns and LOS 

The relationships between care coordination patterns and LOS are depicted in the top of Table 2. 

Table 2 shows the LOS of P1 is the shortest, being 14 hours shorter than P2 and 10 hours shorter 

than  P3.  The  differences  in  LOS  between  P1  and  P2,  as  well  as  P1  and  P3,  were  found  to  be 

significant at the 95% confidence level. There were no significant differences in LOS between P2 

and P3. This may to be due to the fact that the differences in the characteristics of care coordination 

patterns (e.g., graph density (0.17 vs. 0.18) and cluster coefficient (0.70 vs. 0.73)) are not that large 

enough to support the discovery of a small difference in LOS. 

The differences between the patient groups in terms of PheWAS codes, procedure codes, insurance 

programs and ages are depicted in the bottom of Table 2. It can be seen that each patient group 

exhibits  similar  distributions  in  terms  of  i)  PheWAS  codes  (>0.97  PCC,  p  <  2.62    10-26);  ii) 

procedure codes (>0.98 PCC, p < 1.67  10-26); iii) insurance programs (>0.98, p <1.73  10-5); 

and  iv)  ages  (>0.88,  p  <3.36    10-12).  These  results  suggest  that  the  three  care  coordination 

patterns  provided  care  for  the  similar  patients,  but  lead  to  different  LOS.  This  indicates  an 

opportunity to shorten LOS via a refinement of high collaborative care coordination pattern. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Discussion 

To  the  best  of  our  knowledge,  this  is  the  first  study  to  use  EMR  data  to  study  the  relationship 

between care coordination patterns and inpatient hospital LOS among trauma patients. In doing 

so,  it  fills  a  gap  in  knowledge  about  the  relationship  between  care  coordination  (patterns)  and 

health  outcome  (LOS).    The  findings  show  that  the  shortest  LOS  is  associated  with  care 

coordination  patterns  with  high  connectivity,  collaborative  capability  and  low  communication 

cost.  

There are several limitations to this study that we wish to highlight to guide future research in this 

area.  First,  the  findings  suggest  that  more  care  coordination  leads  to  better  health  outcomes; 

however, the reason behind this finding is unclear. Specifically, our investigation focused on the 

statistical analysis and not the semantics of why collaboration occurs.  For instance, it is unclear 

why, the three care coordination patterns lead to different LOS if they provide care for such similar 

patients populations.  Although we found no significant difference between patient groups in terms 

of  PheWAS  codes,  procedure  codes,  insurance  types  and  age,  additional  factors  (e.g.,  specific 

traumatic injury) should be investigated. 

Second,  there  may  be  discordance  between  the  care  coordination  actions  that  manifest  in  the 

physical  clinical  world  and  those  documented  in  the  EMR  system.  Although  the  criteria  of 

meaningful use for EMR systems has been in existence for a number of years (and is now its third 

stage), there are still coordination actions in the physical clinical world that are not documented in 

the EMR systems [42].  This missing information may influence the care coordination patterns and 

patient groups we inferred from the EMR data.  

Third, apart from LOS, other types of care quality measurements (e.g., survival rates, days in the 

intensive  care  unit  and  mortality)  need  to  be  included  to  assess  the  performance  of  care 

coordination. LOS is a critical characteristic to measure health expenditures, for instance, a shorter 

LOS for several major procedures (e.g., abdominal hysterectomy), do not seem to be associated 

with  any  adverse  outcomes  and  result  in  modest  financial  saving  to  the  health  service  [35-36]. 

However, relations between LOS and care quality are unclear [35-36].  Thus, it is a necessity to 

quantify  influence  of  care  coordination  patterns  on  a  combination  of  LOS  and  care  quality 

measurements  (e.g.,  readmission  rate).  In  this  case,  there  is  an  opportunity  to  derive  care 

coordination patterns with small health expenditure but high care quality.  

Fourth, this investigation was based on data from a single academic medical center. Replication of 

this study using data from other healthcare organizations is necessary to confirm these findings.  

 

 

Conclusions 

This study leveraged data-driven methodologies (e.g., spectral co-clustering and network analysis) 

and statistical models (e.g., regression models and person correlation coefficient) to analyze EMR 

data to infer care coordination patterns and quantify their influences on LOS for trauma patients. 

This study showed that care coordination patterns with the high level of collaboration is associated 

with a shorter hospital LOS for trauma patients. This finding is notable because it suggests there 

is an opportunity to mitigate lengthy stays via the selection of highly collaborative coordination 

processes throughout a hospital or healthcare system.

Figure 1. a) A heatmap of the inferred patient groups P1 (428 patients), P2 (1,353), and P3 (3,807) 
and  operational  area  groups  O1  (27  areas),  O2  (86  areas)  and  O3  (66  areas).  b-d)  Three  care 
coordination patterns for P1 - P3. Each pattern is composed of operational areas coming from all 
three operational area groups, but with different patterns of interaction (e.g., network structures) 
among the employees.
