Abstract

Digital Financial Services continue to expand and replace the delivery of traditional bank-
ing services to the customers through innovative technologies to meet the growing complex
needs and globalization challenges. These diversiﬁed digital products help the organizations
(service providers) to improve their ﬁrm performance and to remain competitive in the mar-
ket. It also assists in increasing market share to grow their proﬁtability and improve ﬁnancial
position. There is a growing literature on Digital Financial Services and ﬁrm performance.
At this point of the development, this paper systemically reviews the existing (within last
one decade) amount of literature investigating the impact of DFS on ﬁrm’s performance,
analyzes and identiﬁes the research gaps. We identify 39 works that have appeared in a wide
range of peer-reviewed scientiﬁc journals. We classify the methodologies and approaches
that researchers have used to predict the eﬀect of such services on the ﬁnancial growth and
proﬁtability. We observe that despite rapid technological advancement in DFS during the
last ten years, Digital Financial Services being the factor aﬀecting ﬁrm’s performance didn’t
get the reasonable attention in academic literature. One of the reason is that almost all
the authors limit their research to banking sector while ignoring others particularly mobile
network operators (providing branchless banking) and new non-banking entrants. We also
notice that newer researchers often ignore past research and investigate the same issues. This
study also makes several recommendations and suggest directions for future research in this
still emerging ﬁeld.

Introduction

The revolution of information technology (IT) has changed every aspect of human being’s life in-
cluding banking. IT works as a catalyst for growth in the banking sector; particularly it supports
banking services, productivity growth, and risk management.
IT is a business driver and thus
can be used to reinforce competitive edge (Porter and Millar, 1985). From the last one decade,

ﬁnancial institutions invested heavily in building their IT infrastructure which enabled them a suc-
cessful transformation towards digital banking. Firms investment in IT is under the presumption
that such investments would enhance operating eﬃciency and thus improve ﬁnancial performance.

According to (Gareth et al., 2016) banks in North America, Europe, Asia-Paciﬁc and Latin
America will together spend $241bn on IT in 2016, with an overall increase of almost 4% com-
pared with 2015. We can divide these IT investments theoretically in two parts i-e internal and
external purposes. The internal purpose we mean the investments for risk management, regula-
tory, productivity and business models. External purpose IT investments are solely for the digital
ﬁnancial services. The later part is more important from the perspective of a customer who is
the user of such services. Thus, the issue of service marketing in general and particularly digital
banking services witnessed a substantial growth during the last decade in almost all the countries
around the world.

Digital ﬁnancial services (DFS) expand the delivery of traditional banking services to the
customers through innovative technologies like internet banking, mobile-phone-enabled solutions,
electronic money models and digital payment platforms. Although modern digital banking started
with the automated teller machines (ATM) and phone banking, however, the internet and mobile
banking oﬀer fast and eﬀective delivery channels not only for traditional banking products but also
paved the way for new products as well. The outreach of 3G and 4G internet technology along
with the expanded uses of smartphones and tablets has increased the demand for digital services.
This market demand encourages ﬁnancial institutions, software houses and other service providers
to oﬀer advanced digital banking services together with the advent of new diversiﬁed products and
applications to retain the existing clients and access the unbanked population.

According to the annual Measuring the Information Society (ITU’s) Report at the end of 2016,
there are almost as many mobile-cellular subscriptions as people on earth and 95% of the global
population lives in an area that is covered by a mobile cellular signal. Also by the end of 2016, 47%
of the global population is online—which is certainly progress, but also means that over half of the
world’s population, or roughly 3.9 billion people, is not. The ITU’s predict online access in 2020
will reach 60% of the world’s population. As per leading Fintech analysts, Juniper Research, over
2bn mobile users will have used their devices for banking purposes by the end of 2021, compared
to 1.2bn 2016 globally. These trends suggest potential growth opportunities remain, leading to
predictions of massive increases in the number of DFS users.

Access to ﬁnancial services can serve as a bridge out of poverty. The number of people world-
wide having an account grew by 700 million between 2011 and 2014. 62 percent of the world’s
adult population has an account; up from 51 percent in 2011. Three years ago, 2.5 billion adults
were unbanked. Today, 2 billion adults remain without an account. This represents a 20 percent
decrease (Asli et al., 2015). This shows the growth of DFS through diﬀerent modes (mostly mobile
and internet banking) and the potential to achieve the goal of universal ﬁnancial access.

From the service provider perspective “’there ain’t no such thing as a free lunch”. Their mo-
tive is to improve their ﬁrm performance through enhance operational eﬃciency, increase market
share, innovative products, extend their client reach, improve customer retention, new employment

opportunities and software applications etc. to progress and to remain competitive in the market.

The banking industry (now also newcomers like IT companies) is one of the pioneers of IT-
based ﬁnancial services applications and today heavily depends on DFS in reshaping its service
delivery systems. The ﬁrst ATM was installed in the late 1960s, several DFS have already been
utilized for years by the banking industry since then.

Many studies analyze the eﬀect of DFS on the ﬁrm performance, using both quantitative and
qualitative methodologies. Despite considerable research on DFS and ﬁrm performance that has
appeared in academic journals, a review of the literature on this topic remains missing. Such
reviews play an important role in the development of research ﬁeld through identiﬁcation of areas
where research is lacking. Reviewing existing literature not only provides an opportunity to better
understand the current state of the research, but it also distinguishes patterns in the progress of
the research area itself. The aim of this study is to explore, understand, analyze and summarize
ﬁndings of DFS on ﬁrm performance in the last one decade (2006-2016). It eﬀectively accumulates
the existing body of research into the more coherent body of knowledge, and to interpret previous
ﬁndings. It also identiﬁes and discusses the models and frameworks applied so far in this area.
Summarizes the major ﬁndings and discover important gaps which need more attention and de-
mands further research.

2 Digital Financial Services

DFS are the broad range of ﬁnancial services accessed and delivered through digital channels,
including payments, credit, savings, remittances, insurance and ﬁnancial information. The term
“digital channels” refers to the internet, mobile phones (both smartphones and digital feature
phones), ATMs, POS terminals, NFC-enabled devices, chips, electronically enabled cards, biomet-
ric devices, tablets, phablets and any other digital system (AFI, 2016).

DFS have signiﬁcant potential to expand the delivery of basic ﬁnancial services via aﬀordable,
convenient and secure environment to the public at large (particularly the poor) through innovative
technologies like mobile-phone-enabled solutions, electronic money models, and digital payment
platforms. Financial Institutions (Banks, Microﬁnance institutions) and non-Financial ﬁrms (mo-
bile network operators) and third party providers (agent network managers, payment aggregators,
and others) are leveraging digital channels to oﬀer basic ﬁnancial services at greater convenience,
scale and lower cost than traditional banking allow. The digital revolution adds new layers to the
material cultures of ﬁnancial inclusion, oﬀering the state new ways of expanding the inclusion of
the ‘legible’, and global ﬁnance new forms of ‘proﬁling’ poor households into generators of ﬁnancial
assets (Gabor and Brooks, 2016).

Mobile telephony (DFS) exerts a signiﬁcant and non-negligible impact on economic growth
(Saibal, 2016).The extensive use of digital ﬁnance could boost annual GDP of all emerging economies
by $3.7 trillion by 2025 (6% increase). Approximately 65% of this increase would come from raised
productivity of ﬁnancial and non-ﬁnancial businesses and governments as a result of digital pay-

3

ments. This additional GDP could lead to the creation of up to 95 million jobs across all sectors
(James et al., 2016).

As DFS include many digital channels (improving day to day).We noticed that in our identiﬁed
articles (2006 to 2016) researchers mainly focus on one particular channel at a point in time to
execute their research (see Table1). Most of the studies used internet banking (34%) as DFS
channel followed by automated/internet/self-service technology (32%).

3 Research Methodology

To determine the current state of research pertaining to DFS and ﬁrm performance we conducted
an extensive literature review. Since DFS is an interdisciplinary topic hence the relevant research
articles are published in a wide variety of academic journals and few records of conference proceed-
ings. To identify the relevant articles, we have done a systemic scan of various databases (academic
journals & Conferences) through multiple relevant key terms (see Table2).

To ﬁnd a relevant article in a database each key objective term is searched with the combi-
nation of subjective terms. Through identiﬁed articles, we explored the citations and references
to ﬁnd any previous or leading work that is in our scope. In addition, Google scholar identiﬁed
certain articles which were not accessible in the other databases mentioned in table1. Initially 52
articles were found, however, a two-step pre-selection is performed before including the article in
our literature review. In the ﬁrst step, we discard few articles for which the publisher or journal is
identiﬁed as unauthenticated. This step is necessary as we used Google scholar as well other than
scientiﬁc databases. In the second step, abstracts are read to eliminate the articles that do not
deal with the subject.

The ﬁnal selection resulted in 39 relevant research articles, wherein 36 were published in scien-
tiﬁc journals and 2 in conferences and 1 in SSRN. Hence the selected articles represented a wide
range of peer-reviewed scientiﬁc journals. The period reviewed is from January 2006-December
2016 (Inclusive). The period of last one decade is selected mainly due to two reasons. Firstly, the
companies (particularly banking) started IT investments in the 90s but heavily invested in DFS
(online banking) products from the year 2000 onwards. Secondly, due to the sharp growth in mo-
bile and internet accessibility from the year 2005 onwards the usage of DFS improve and continue
to increase.The companies transform from traditional to the digital model in this era to ﬁll the

customer needs, remain in the competition, improve eﬃciency and hence to reap the beneﬁts of
digitization. So we decided to review the research of last one decade. The selected articles used
diﬀerent research approaches and methodologies. The studies were conducted in diﬀerent regions
including both developed and developing countries.

Out of 39 studies included in this literature review, more than half (59%) of articles were published
from 2011-2016 and the rest 41% were from 2006 to 2010. In 2012 there was only one study. In
total 33 journals published articles related to DFS and ﬁrm ﬁnancial performance. Of which 26
published each one article and ﬁve published two articles each from 2006 to 2016 (see Table3).

Most studies are empirical in nature which is understandable from the title of article wherein
topic ﬁnancial performance is reviewed in the literature. 97% of the selected articles in this review
used the quantitative technique(s) while only one study (Kennedy and Jacky, 2013) was found
qualitative in nature. Of 39 selected articles 60% were published by top-ranked publishers like
Elsevier, Emerald, Inderscience, Taylor & Francis, Wiley, and Springer. Further, the Elsevier pub-
lished the most articles (8, 21%) followed by Emerald (6, 6%).

The studies applied diﬀerent ﬁnancial, econometric, mathematical and operation research tech-
niques to investigate the impact of diﬀerent DFS on the ﬁrm’s performance. Regression analysis is

7

the most popular estimating technique which is used in more than 60% studies. Interestingly all the
studies were performed in the banking sector including community and primarily internet banks.
The research articles used the number of banks or their branches as sample size. The average sam-
ple size was 534, with the largest number of banks in the USA followed by European countries.The
maximum sample size (6566) is used by (Dandapani et al., 2008), while (S˜org and Luˇstˇsik, 2006)
and (D. Karimzadeh et al., 2014) investigated only one bank each. Geographically the most inves-
tigated regions were Europe followed by USA and south Asia (India, Pakistan and Bangladesh).
Out of 39 studies 21 (54%) were conducted in developed countries and the remaining 17 (44%)
in developing country, while one study incorporates both developing and developed countries (see
Table4).

We also list the 15 most-cited articles from our literature review (see Table5). We made the cut
at 20 citations from Google Scholar as the citation for some articles was very less. These 15 studies
were mainly conducted in developed countries with exception of two articles in India and Kenya.
The articles in journals with higher impact factors or published by the high ranked publishers are
the most-cited (citation above 100) publications. Out of 39 articles, only four publications could
cross the mark of 100 citations so far. These 15 most cited articles ﬁlled the research gap, provide

In Table6, we gathered research techniques used to investigate the impact of diﬀerent DFS on
the ﬁrm’s performance. In our literature review (39 articles) we could ﬁnd eight diﬀerent math-
ematical, ﬁnancial, econometric, and operation research techniques. Most of the studies (70%)
combined ﬁnancial ratios and regression analysis followed by (13%) data envelopment and prin-
cipal component analysis.
In addition, As Table6 reveals, few authors (e.g (S˜org and Luˇstˇsik,
2006),(Del Giudice et al., 2016),(Mehmood et al., 2015),(Lin et al., 2011),) used one speciﬁc tech-
nique which is not used by any other author in the entire sample of review.

We identiﬁed diﬀerent dependent and independent variables used in the prior research to un-
fold the impact of DFS on the ﬁrm’s performance. As many as 28 dependent and 16 independent
variables have been identiﬁed (see Table7). Among the identiﬁed dependent variables, ROE and
ROA are the most commonly used; approximately two-third of all studies cite them. The other
more frequently used dependent variables include income (net, non-interest, and interest), deposits,
operating expense, staﬀ costs, eﬃciency ratio and average internet users. More than half (15) of
dependent variables, as listed in Table7, have been tested only once or twice. Out of 16 inde-
pendent variables used to inspect the impact of DFS on ﬁrm’s performance, the most frequently
used are; the number of ATMs, internet adoption, and internet banking. Notably, one-third of all
reviewed articles cite them. The other more frequently used independent variables are the number
of branches, POS, the number of employees, cards (debit or credit), website, electronic and mobile

banking. Approximately One-third of all independent variables, as listed in Table7, have been
tested only once or twice.

In order to control the eﬀect of other variables on the ﬁnancial performance at the same time
while examining the DFS relationship, many studies used diﬀerent control variables. These include
ﬁnancial (bank size, loans, deposits etc) and economic (GDP, inﬂation, job growth etc), as listed
in Table7.

5 Research gaps

A review of prior, relevant literature is only eﬀective if it creates a ﬁrm foundation for advancing
knowledge, closes the outdated research areas, identifying the possible research gaps while uncov-
ering areas where future research is needed (Jane and Richard, 2002). Given the ﬁndings in this
literature review, we also outlined certain areas of research where future research should be aiming
at.

Most of the studies included in this literature review are of quantitative in nature. However, it
has been observed that data pertaining to the digital channels used as DFS is either very limited
or not empirical in nature. Although ﬁnancial data indicating the performance of the company
is available easily, however, secondary data for digital payment channels were non-existent in the
early stage (the 2000s) of emerging DFS. But nowadays availability of resources increased signif-
icantly. Hence to improve the quality and applicability of their studies, researchers are expected

10

to use better quality data to validate their research.

IT is no more a source of enjoyment for developed countries only. The developing and under
developing countries in the recent years (last one decade) invested a lot to develop the IT infras-
tructure. Both the traditional and digital banking services improved and increased. Since last
one-century crossing borders have proved to be diﬃcult both in developed and developing coun-
tries. Hence the DFSs varied from country to country with exception of few products e.g globally
accepted credit cards. Few of the main reasons for variation are regulations, social and cultural
environment and market structure. Therefore, it is diﬃcult to generalize the results of many DFS
research. In our literature review we could only ﬁnd four ((DeYoung et al., 2007),(Akhisar et al.,
2015),(Delgado et al., 2007),(Wu and Dash Wu, 2010)) multi-country studies. Future research cov-
ering diﬀerent countries with comparative market structure could improve the generalizations. A
comparative analysis of DFSs performance and its eﬀect on ﬁrm with respect to customer based
in rural and urban areas could be interesting as well.

The impact of DFSs is no more limited to the banking industry. It is widely being used by
other industries as the payment solution for various purposes e.g online shopping, grocery stores,
supermarkets, insurance, mobile service providers and trading etc. The 39 research articles in-
cluded in this review studied the impact of DFS on banking industry (as a service provider) only.
We encourage to include more industries e.g IT, Telecom, Energy, Healthcare, Automotive, and
Supply Chain companies (as service providers or co-providers) to see how are they getting beneﬁt
from such customer oriented services. This more representative sample would provide valuable
insights into performance and extend understanding.

So far, the research is focused on digital currencies being used for digital channels in DFS.
However, cryptocurrencies (e.g bitcoin, ether, monero, Zcash and dash etc) can also use the same
digital channels in DFS. Future research on how cryptocurrencies will aﬀect the performance of
oﬀering and accepting ﬁrm could be interesting. The comparison of crypto versus digital currency
for the same accepting ﬁrm could also provide interesting results to understand the performance.

The branchless banking e.g M–Pesa, Easypaisa, G-Cash, Ready-cash etc (in developing) and
Paypal, skrill, Paysafecard and Neteller etc (in developed countries), are serving the masses and
now a major competitor for traditional banking model. In developing countries, such services are
being provided by mobile service providers while in developed by nonbank companies. The future
research to investigate the role of such services in the proﬁtability and performance of mobile service
providers’ companies could be interesting and the comparison of branchless banking in developed
and developing countries can extend understanding for adoption, eﬃciency, performance and trust.

Although most of the studies (82%) support the argument that DFS improve the performance
and proﬁtability of the ﬁrm, however, few studies (18%) doesn’t support this argument. Also few
studies e.g (Siddik et al., 2016),(Van et al., 2015),(Ceylan et al., 2008),and (Hernando and a J. Nieto,
2007) indicated the time lag of more than two years to get the beneﬁt from such IT investments.
This leads to an important aspect missing in the literature that how much should be digitized or
what should be the optimal digitization in terms of return (both ﬁnancial and non-ﬁnancial) on
these investments. Also which factors are aﬀecting this optimal digitization. For example, it could

11

be interesting to investigate whether Technological advancement and customer aﬃnity (awareness
to use) are running at the same pace or not. Because if the technology is running at the higher
rate than the consumer awareness and utilization, then the adoption by the organizations would
likely lead to loss or the lag period to get beneﬁt may increase more.

The other important area missing in the literature is the state bonds and lotteries. Previously
one could only buy such products at particular bank or store but due to DFS now one can buy
these online and even the funds can transfer or withdraw directly from home with internet access.
This not only increased sale and customers locally but also globally. It is needed to investigate
how DFS are aﬀecting such products and organizations.

6 Conclusion

This paper systemically reviewed the existing (within last one decade) amount of literature inves-
tigating the impact of DFS on ﬁrm’s performance, identiﬁed the research gaps and outlined seven
speciﬁc future areas of research. We found only 39 relevant articles out of which only four got
citation above 100, furthermore only half of them were published in high ranked journals. We con-
clude that despite rapid technological advancement in DFS during the last ten years, DFS being
the factor aﬀecting ﬁrm’s performance didn’t get the attention in academic literature. One of the
reason is that almost all the authors focused their research only on banking sector while ignoring
others particularly mobile network operators (providing branchless banking) and new non-banking
entrants. We also noticed that newer researchers (mainly in developing countries) have often ig-
nored past research and investigated the same issues. This also explains why we have seen such
limited progress in last ten years in this area of research.

Overall the research conducted on DFS and bank’s performance is promising. This research
tends to integrate the other sectors and digital channels that have not been studied so far and
need more attention.
It is understandable that data availability remained a big challenge due
to privacy issues but a collaborative eﬀort from academicians and practitioners could overcome
it in future. The constant evolution of technology and complexity of products call for additional
research. There are still numerous areas related to DFS and ﬁrm’s performance that require deeper
attention in future. We expect that this literature review and our identiﬁed future research areas
will provide useful guidance for the research community interested in DFS.
