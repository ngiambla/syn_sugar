 We argue that a better algorithm should simultaneously require less computation and generate higher accuracy.
 However, the algorithmic accuracy and computational complexity may be very sensitive to the statistics of data sets.
 In order to increase the system scalability and accuracy of standard CF, we introduce a network-based rec- ommendation algorithm with spreading activation, namely SA-CF.
 Numerical results To test the algorithmic accuracy and personality, we use a benchmark data-set, namely MovieLens 19.
 The black solid and red dash curves represent the performances of SA-CF and CF, respectively.
 The above simulation results indicate that SA-CF outperforms CF from the viewpoints of accuracy and personality.
 Besides the algorithmic accuracy and personality, the computational complex- ity should also be taken into account.
 Actually, we argue that a better algorithm should simultaneously require less computation and generate higher accuracy.
 Both the two modi ed algorithm can further enhance the accuracy of SA-CF.
 More signi cantly, with properly choice of the parameter N , top-N SA-CF can simultaneously reduces the computational complexity and improves the algorithmic accuracy.
