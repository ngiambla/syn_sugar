 We then sep- arately examine highly variable behaviors for users, content rating and network formation, in Secs. 3, 4, and 5, respectively.
 For the rest of the users, Fig. 2 shows the distribution of votes among users who voted at least once for noninitial resolves.
 Plot includes a curve for a lognormal distribution t, which is indistinguishable from the points and with parameters = 0.03 0.05 and = 1.70 0.04.
 The step at age 50 is, pre- sumably, due to a limit on number of recent resolves readily accessible to users.
 The persistence of votes on resolves based on the wide variation of r values among resolves gives rise to a multiplicative process with decay.
 With the wide variation in r values for resolves and the activity rates for users (Fig. 4), a natural question is whether these variations are related.
 A common property of such networks is the wide range in numbers of links made by users, i.e., the degree distribution of the network.
 The need to build ideological pro les suggests votes on common resolves is key to the number and type of links.
 The wide variation in activity times and u among users (Fig. 1 and 4) gives rise to a wide distribution of number of links.
 In particular, users with few votes will also have few common votes with other users and hence their links will tend to be mostly friends.
 Furthermore, we can expect f (a) to change slowly with time as primarily due to how the user in- terface makes resolves visible to users.
