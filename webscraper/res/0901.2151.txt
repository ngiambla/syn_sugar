 We show that this unduely constrains their results, leading to a bias in the size of the communities they nd and limiting their e ectivness.
 The e ectiveness of this combined algorithm is also demonstrated by using it on real-world example networks.
 For a number of these examples, it achieves the best results of any known algorithm.
 The problem of detecting and characterizing the commu- nity structure of complex networks has recently attracted a great deal of interest [1 10].
 This is true for many di erent types of networks including social, biological, and telecommunication networks.
 For exam- ple, recent work suggests the importance of modularity for the functioning of metabolic and transcriptional regu- latory networks [11 14].
 The optimal partitioning results if bisection- ing is combined with nal-tuning. obtained using this trisectioning method for the ensemble of random networks described above.
 Two peaks are now seen near N/9 and N/27, indicating a bias for nding com- munities of these sizes.
 Since, 9 and 27 are powers of 3, this bias is due to the trisectioning nature of the algorithm.
 This result indicates that the peaks found using bisection- ing and trisectioning are artifacts of the methods, which are constrained to only allow division of existing communi- ties and never move nodes to other existing communities.
