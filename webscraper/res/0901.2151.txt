 The e ectiveness of this combined algorithm is also demonstrated by using it on real-world example networks.
 This is true for many di erent types of networks including social, biological, and telecommunication networks.
 For exam- ple, recent work suggests the importance of modularity for the functioning of metabolic and transcriptional regu- latory networks [11 14].
 Using this additional nal-tuning , the value of modularity is consistently im- proved.
 To avoid complications with the community de- tection process, only fully connected networks have been considered.
 In the nal-tuning procedure, the di er- ences in modularity associated with moving every node of p-3 Y.
 To incorporate nal-tuning into the community detec- tion, we suggest the following algorithm. 1.
 The results were obtained using the q = 2 leading eigenvector method with ne-tuning (blue squares), and by combining it with nal-tuning (red circles).
 The computational complexity of the leading eigenvalue algorithm with ne-tuning is O[N (N + m)] for one bi- section [27].
 This is because nal-tuning removes the undue constraints that exist in simple bisectioning methods.
 This extra step re- quires only minor computational cost, and does not in- crease the order of the computational complexity of the overall algorithm.
