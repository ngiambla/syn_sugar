 Here we describe the current status and activities of MICA, and its long-term goals. 2 The Meta-Institute for Computational Astrophysics (MICA) To the best of our knowledge, MICA is the first professional scientific organization based entirely in VWs.
 It is intended to serve as an experimental platform for science and scholarship in VWs, and it will be the organizing framework for the work proposed here.
 To act as a forum for exchange of ideas and joint efforts with other scientific disciplines in promoting these goals for science and scholarship in general.
 We also plan to develop partnerships with the relevant industry laboratories, and conduct joint efforts in providing innovation in this emerging and transformative technology.
 In that process, we hope to define the best practices and optimal use of VR tools in research and education, including scholarly communications.
 This is the kind of activity that we expect will engage a much broader segment of the academic community in exploration and use of VR technologies.
 Second, we hope to develop new research tools and techniques, and help lay the foundations of the informational environments for the next generation of VR-enabled Web.
 It is intended to be a friendly and welcoming virtual environment for scholarly collaborations and discussions, very much in the tradition of academe of the golden age Athens.
 It is also intended to be a gateway for other scholars, new to VWs, to start to explore the potential and the practical uses of these technologies in an easy, welcoming, and collegial environment.
 MICA represents a multi-faceted effort aimed to develop new modalities of scientific research and communication using new technologies of immersive VR and VWs.
 We have also established a strong network of international partnerships, including colleagues and institutions in the Netherlands, Italy, Japan, China, and Canada (a list which is bound to grow).
