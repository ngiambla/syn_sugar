 The goals of MICA are to explore the utility of the emerging VR and VWs technologies for scientific and scholarly work in general, and to facilitate and accelerate their adoption by the scientific research community.
 We describe the current and planned activities and research directions of MICA, and offer some thoughts as to what the future developments in this arena may be.
 Here we describe the current status and activities of MICA, and its long-term goals. 2 The Meta-Institute for Computational Astrophysics (MICA) To the best of our knowledge, MICA is the first professional scientific organization based entirely in VWs.
 It is intended to serve as an experimental platform for science and scholarship in VWs, and it will be the organizing framework for the work proposed here.
 MICA is currently based in Second Life (SL) [9] (it initially used the VW of Qwaq [10]), but it will expand and migrate to other VWs and venues as appropriate.
 To act as a forum for exchange of ideas and joint efforts with other scientific disciplines in promoting these goals for science and scholarship in general.
 In that process, we hope to define the best practices and optimal use of VR tools in research and education, including scholarly communications.
 This is the kind of activity that we expect will engage a much broader segment of the academic community in exploration and use of VR technologies.
 Second, we hope to develop new research tools and techniques, and help lay the foundations of the informational environments for the next generation of VR-enabled Web.
 Specifically, we are working in the following directions: 2.1 Improving Scientific Collaboration and Communication Our experience is that an immediate benefit of VWs is as an effective scientific communication and collaboration platform.
