 Here we analyse large data sets about users and Blogs which they write and comment, mapped onto a bipartite graph.
 Unlike friends networks, in-advance relationship between authors of Blogs and other users is not an underlying context on Blogs.
 Links between users and posts are also directed, depending on the action (reading or writing the post/comment).
 In Sec. 4 we determine the community structure of users and ne clustering of posts within user groups.
 Thus, the internal structure of posts emerges in a self-organized manner through user inter- actions on posts and comment-on-comment actions.
 The availability of posts is time limited to seven days (this rule was imposed after rst few months of the functioning).
 The distribution of time in- tervals between user s successive activities is given in Fig. 2 for both BBC and B92 Blog users.
 In Fig. 4 the dispersion of these time series U (j) of a given user Marija Mitrovi c, Bosiljka Tadi c: Bloggers and Blogs Communities 3 Fig. 2.
 The scaling plot of all posts time series, similar to the one of users in Fig. 4, is shown in Fig. 6(bottom).
 Note that in the structure of B92 Blogs, where the users are allowed to write new posts and where also comment-on-comment is allowed and noti ed in the data, in- and out-degree distributions are di erent, as shown in Fig. 8 (top panel).
 In the BBC Blogs, however, the users are only allowed to write comments on the original posts, the di erence between in- and out- degree distribution of users entirely disappears, see Fig. 8.
 In Fig. 12 these posts are further di erentiated according to the authors of the posts or comments.
