 Here we analyse large data sets about users and Blogs which they write and comment, mapped onto a bipartite graph.
 In such enlarged Blog space we trace user activity over time, which results in robust temporal patterns of user Blog behavior and the emergence of communities.
 With the spectral methods applied to the projection on weighted user network we detect clusters of users related to their common interests and habits.
 In this way, our network 2 Marija Mitrovi c, Bosiljka Tadi c: Bloggers and Blogs Communities makes an enlarged Blog space, with users and posts (and comments to the posts) treated at the equal level.
 In the Blog data we construct the distributions P (t ti) having the posting time ti of all posts and the action time t, i.e., posting a comment to the post i.
 The distribu- tions averaged over all posts are shown in Fig. 5 for both B92 and BBC Blogs, with slopes 2.8 and 2.3 respectively.
 Degree distribution in the case of our directed bi- partite network can be determined for in- and out-degree and in both partitions.
 The users in groups gU 1 and gU 4 (lower and upper branch in Fig. 11), are linked to the Posts which we show as the network Fig. 12.
 By inspection of the text in these posts and related comments, we nd that all posts in the user group gU 1 are related to sports (football), and posts in group gU 4 are about the urban architecture and related urban life problems [Tables 1,2 of these posts are available on Supportive material, in Serbian].
 Although these two groups are rather small, one can see that the number of posts and comments by di erent users varies, in accordance with the broad distribution of the user degree on the bipartite network, mentioned in sec. 3.
