 It strongly advocated the development of human resource cadre and the role of higher educational Institutions that will be the foundation of the technological advancement in the country.
 This prompted Government of India to take a major ICT initiative to lay down the ICT policy for whole of the country, which the planning and implementation by the Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD) at various levels particularly through higher educational institutions/ universities of the country.
 Initiatives to have an assessment of its utilization and overall performance and efficiency, of any higher educational institution, are quite essential, in identifying, planning and achieving the ICT strategies at the respective levels.
 Essentially, this has formed the basis of motivation to undertake the study of the ICT initiatives, status and its academic performance in various universities in the western Himalayan region of the country and then to analyze, using simple statistical methods, the ICT based academic/ technological status and performance of different universities, and assess in a comparative manner, their vision, planning, initiative, status activities and impact.
 One group of authors (Riley and Nuttall 1994) suggests that Performance Indicators must be something quantitative, whereas the other group takes a wider view in favour of qualitative and descriptive statement for PI.
 Both these measures, quantitative as well as qualitative, will be used here that will allow us to have a complete view of richness and diversity of the ICT based academic/ latter view ICT technological performance and the related activities.
 With these it should be possible to assess and judge the effectiveness, efficiency and impact of an institution in terms of ICT performance to have the possible projection to finally decide about the future strategies.
 In deciding the basic framework, the question is what are the ingredients/ components and Performance Indicators for assessing the ICT initiative, status and their performance at different levels.
 Our findings about the overall ICT status is on the basis of performance and impact do match with the reported ranking given to universities by NAAC and other agencies.
 This finding is quite interesting which proclaims that overall progress shown by any of the universities is mainly due to the respective progress through initiative, planning, infrastructure and performance in the field of ICT.
