 Data of figure 3 provide us with P(ar | s=1), the probability of age range of the head for households of size 1 (single).
 Data of figure 4 together with data of figure 3, provide with P(ar | s>1), the probability of age range of the head for households of size superior to 1.
 We pick the age of children with probability P(ai | ar)*P(child | ai) for single-parent and P(ai | ar')*P(child | ai) for couples.
 We use for the comparison both the data implicitly used in the building algorithm and other national and municipality level data, which were not used in the generation process.
 We calculate the distributions both for one single realization of the system and for a sequence of 100 realizations (the random nature of the algorithm leads to some variations from one run to the other).
