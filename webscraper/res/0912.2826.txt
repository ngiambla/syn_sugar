 This leads to algorithm 2, where we use the list of ages of individuals directly taken from the data, and a probability of household P'(t, s, (ai)), independently from the distribution of ages in the population: Algorithm 2: 1.
 Data of figure 3 provide us with P(ar | s=1), the probability of age range of the head for households of size 1 (single).
 Data of figure 4 together with data of figure 3, provide with P(ar | s>1), the probability of age range of the head for households of size superior to 1.
 Data of figure 5 provide us with P(t | ar = ), the probability of a household type given the age of the head equals , and the probability P(child | a = ) for a individual of age to live in a household without being the head or the partner (this means, as a "child"2).
 We pick the age of children with probability P(ai | ar)*P(child | ai) for single-parent and P(ai | ar')*P(child | ai) for couples.
 Indeed, the described algorithm should a priori be repeated until all the households of the list are filled with all the individuals of the availability vector.
 We calculate the distributions both for one single realization of the system and for a sequence of 100 realizations (the random nature of the algorithm leads to some variations from one run to the other).
 It could be expected: the data we are using in this case for the comparison are at national data, and therefore keep into account of the population of metropolitan areas.
