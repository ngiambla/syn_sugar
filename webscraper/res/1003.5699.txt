 First, we assess how buzz and attention is created for different movies and how that changes over time.
 Movie producers spend a lot of effort and money in publicizing their movies, and have also embraced the Twitter medium for this purpose.
 We then focus on the mechanism of viral marketing and pre-release hype on Twitter, and the role that attention plays in forecasting real-world box- of ce performance.
 For a bad movie, the initial reviews might be enough to discourage others from watching it, while on the other hand, it is possible for interest to be generated by positive reviews and opinions over time.
 We discovered that the rate at which movie tweets are generated can be used to build a powerful model for predicting movie box-of ce revenue.
 ATTENTION AND POPULARITY We are interested in studying how attention and popularity are generated for movies on Twitter, and the effects of this attention on the real-world performance of the movies consid- ered.
 Pre-release Attention: Prior to the release of a movie, media companies and and producers generate promotional information in the form of trailer videos, news, blogs and photos.
 We want to determine whether movies that have greater publicity, in terms of linked urls on Twitter, perform better in the box of ce.
 When we examined the correlation between the urls and retweets with the box-of ce performance, we found the correlation to be moderately positive, as shown in Table 3.
 The fact that a simple linear regression model considering only the rate of tweets on movies can perform better than arti cial money markets, illustrates the power of social media.
