 We show that a simple model built from the rate at which tweets are created about particular topics can outperform market-based predictors.
 Movie producers spend a lot of effort and money in publicizing their movies, and have also embraced the Twitter medium for this purpose.
 ATTENTION AND POPULARITY We are interested in studying how attention and popularity are generated for movies on Twitter, and the effects of this attention on the real-world performance of the movies consid- ered.
 Pre-release Attention: Prior to the release of a movie, media companies and and producers generate promotional information in the form of trailer videos, news, blogs and photos.
 We expect the tweets for movies before the time of their release to consist primarily of such promotional campaigns, geared to promote word-of- mouth cascades.
 The graph outlining the predicted and actual values of this model is also shown in Fig 6, outlining the utility of harvesting social media.
 The corresponding R2 value for this combined model is 0.788, which is far lower than the ones obtained by our predictors.
 Predicting revenues for all movies for a given weekend Until now, we have considered the problem of predicting opening weekend revenue for movies.
 Subjectivity Our expectation is that there would be more value for sentiments after the movie has released, than before.
 We expect tweets prior to the release to be mostly anticipatory and stronger positive/negative tweets to be disseminated later following the release.
 In the case of movies, the distribution parameter is the number of theaters a particular movie is released in.
