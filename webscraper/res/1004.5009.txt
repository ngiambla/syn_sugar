 The underlying key mechanism of these puzzling and unfortunate con- clusions are identi ed using the Galam sequential probabilistic model of opinion dynamics [1, 2, 3].
 It reveals that the existence of in exible agents and their respective proportions are the instrumental parame- ters to determine the faith of incomplete scienti c data public debates.
 When the evidence is not as strong as claimed, the in exibles rather than the data are found to drive the opinion of the serge.galam@polytechnique.edu 1 population.
 However they failed to convince a substantial part of the public for which Intelligent Design is as scienti c as Darwin theory.
 Several puzzling questions arise : Why in order to refute scienti cally Intelligent Design did scientists sometimes overdo the scienti c validity of Darwin theory?
 The goal was to convince the public and the au- thorities to enforce a drastic change in our way of life.
 Denoting in exibles the rst agents and oaters the others leads to evoke the Galam sequential probabilistic model of opinion dynamics [1, 2, 3].
 It yields two attractors pA = 1 and pB = 0 and a critical threshold pc,r = 1 2, which separates the ow opinion in direction of either pA or pB.
 From pt < pc,r there exists a number m of updates to yield pt > pt+1 > pt+2 > . . . > pt+m = pt+m+1 = pB = where now opinion A has disappeared as seen from Figure 1.
 Our ndings lead to the unfortunate and disturbing conclusion that to adopt a fair discourse is a de nite lose-out strategy to promote a cause in a public debate.
 Above results may enlighten the mechanisms by which the public debate about the human culpability with respect to the global warming has gained such an increasing support all over the world.
