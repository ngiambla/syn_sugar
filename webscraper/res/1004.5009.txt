 The results shed a new but disturbing light on Designing adequate strategies to win a public debate. 2 1 Setting the problem Public opinion is today a key ingredient in modern societies policy making.
 In contrast, climatologists took the initiative to alert the public on global warming with only a few scientists to oppose them.
 Up to 2000 most people did not consider the climate is an issue and did not look at carbon dioxide emissions as causing global warming.
 It suc- ceeded in dismissing the alleged scienti c character of Intelligent Design and thus did convince institutions and a majority of the public to reject the call for changing school programs not mixing science and religion.
 However they failed to convince a substantial part of the public for which Intelligent Design is as scienti c as Darwin theory.
 Several puzzling questions arise : Why in order to refute scienti cally Intelligent Design did scientists sometimes overdo the scienti c validity of Darwin theory?
 It yields two attractors pA = 1 and pB = 0 and a critical threshold pc,r = 1 2, which separates the ow opinion in direction of either pA or pB.
 From pt > pc,r there exists a number n of updates to reach equilibrium with pt < pt+1 < pt+2 < . . . < pt+n = pt+n+1 = pA = 1 where only opinion A exits.
 Denoting a and b the percentages of respective in exibles for A and B the associated respective proportions of oaters are (pt a) and (1 pt b).
 We thus have pt a and 1 pt b pt 1 b, which combine to a pt 1 b, (3) to which we add the constraints 0 a 1 and 0 b 1 with 0 a + b 1. (4) To keep the calculations simple we restrict the present study to groups of size 3 with Eq. (1) writing pt+1 = p3 t + 3p2 t (1 pt), (5) which corresponds now to the case of zero in exible.
