 We provide a quantitative, large scale, temporal analysis of the dynamics of online content popularity in two massive model systems, the Wikipedia and an entire country s Web space.
 In each case the KS statistic suggests that the power- law curve is the better t for the tail.
 For the distribution of k/k in Wikipedia (a) the parameters are = 2.6 for the exponent of the power law, with a lower cuto of 12 and a KS statistic of 0.005.
 In Fig. 4a and 4b we show the indegree distribution of the rank-shift model for several values of : = 1 (a) and = 1.5 (b).
 We there- fore expect k/k for a node to be distributed around L/L, regardless of the node.
 For = 0 we recover the original ranking model, which yields a lognormal distribution of x/x, like the preferential attachment (Fig. 3a).
 For > 0 numerical simulations show that the tail of the popularity burst magnitude dis- tribution shifts from a lognormal to a power law.
 The popularity distribution itself remains a power law; its ex- ponent remains = 1 + 1/ , but with an exponential cuto depending on .
 Such a parsimonious model is able to reproduce the most relevant features observed in the empirical data.
 Remarkably the model captures the long-range distribution of inter- burst intervals as well (Fig. 3d).
