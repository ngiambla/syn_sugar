 We provide a quantitative, large scale, temporal analysis of the dynamics of online content popularity in two massive model systems, the Wikipedia and an entire country s Web space.
 We nd that the dynamics of popularity are characterized by bursts, displaying characteristic features of critical systems such as fat-tailed distributions of magnitude and inter-event time.
 We propose a minimal model combining the classic preferential popularity increase mechanism with the occurrence of random popularity shifts due to exogenous factors.
 For each document we record the time stamp of each event for which x/x > 1 and measure the inter-event times t.
 The probability distributions of t in the di erent data sets (Fig. 2d) are not distributed following a Poissonian, as expected by queueing theory in traditional systems, but in a power-law fashion with a nite size cuto , as in Omori s law of earthquakes [24] and other self-organized criticality phenomena [25].
 Let L be the number of links added during the interval T at whose extremes Figure 4: Rank-shift model. (a), (b).
 Indegree distribution: = 1 (a), = 1.5 (b). (c) Comparison of the distribution of popularity bursts for the ranking model [27] (circles) and a stylized model built upon the simple assumptions of growth described in the text. (d) Comparison of the distribution of popularity bursts with the expected slope derived by assuming that nodes are reranked at most once. the ratio k/k is computed.
 Simulations of the rank-shift model were performed us- ing parameters matching those from the empirical data (e.g., N = 2.8 105 nodes for the Wikipedia in 2003); the free model parameters were set to t the empirical distributions: 1 1.2 and 10 5 10 3.
 For > 0 numerical simulations show that the tail of the popularity burst magnitude dis- tribution shifts from a lognormal to a power law.
 The popularity distribution itself remains a power law; its ex- ponent remains = 1 + 1/ , but with an exponential cuto depending on .
