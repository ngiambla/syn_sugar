 We introduce an extensible framework that will enable the real-time analysis of meme diffusion in social media by mining, visualizing, mapping, classifying, and modeling massive streams of public microblogging events.
 Sankaranarayanan et al. developed an automated break- ing news detection system based on the linking behavior of Twitter users [44], while Heer and Boyd describe a system for visualizing and exploring the relationships between users in large-scale social media systems [23].
 They build a classi er that achieves approximately 87% accuracy in identifying spam tweets, and similar accuracy in de- tecting the spam accounts themselves.
 The post might also involve a set of memes consisting of hashtags and URLs referenced in the tweet.
 The meme_filter s goal is to extract only those tweets that pertain to memes of signi cant general interest.
 Here the user can examine the sta- tistical data described above, tweets relating the meme of interest, and sentiment analysis data.
 An- other account, @HopeMarie_25, had a similar behavior to @PeaceKaren_25 in retweeting the accounts of the same candidates and boosting the same Web sites.
 We began by producing a hand-labeled corpus of training ex- amples in three classes truthy, legitimate, and remove.
 We thank the Gephi toolkit for aid in our visualizations and the many users who have provided feedback and annotations.
