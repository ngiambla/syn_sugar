 One way of extending these capacities is to connect the social simulation community (e.g. the European Social Simulation Association, ESSA [59]) with natural and computer scientists, engineers, and ICT researchers.
 Most likely, di erent individuals apply di erent rules, and the application of the respective behavioral choice rule may even be situation-dependent ( framing e ect ) [61].
 Due to the di culties related to the fact that multi-disciplinary research, education and funding does not t well into existing institutional settings, it would be advised to build up a new, multi-disciplinary eld and study direction.
 The corresponding ICT sys- tems should be suited to craft policy options, contingency plans, and intelligent responses to emerging challenges and risks.
 They will allow one to develop concepts and institutional designs for a exible, adaptive, and resource-e cient real-time management of complex socio-economic systems and organiza- tions.
 By informing all the stakeholders in a better way, it will be easier to assess di erent options and their often counter-intuitive feedback, cascading, and side e ects.
 In this way, it will also become more e cient to develop contingency plans and intelligent responses to emerging risks or opportunities, having the best of all knowledge at hand.
 In such a way, new designs will be determined for smarter cities, transport, tra c and logistics, for intelligent energy production and consumption, or for a better social and economic participation.
