 The recording, accessing, data mining and dissemination of this information a ect in a crucial way the progress of knowledge of mankind in the next years.
 Scientists should design, explore and validate protocols for the access and use of this information able to maximize the access and freedom of research and meanwhile protect and respect the private nature of part of it.
 Research societies should set up committees selecting protocols for the optimal access, use and dissemination of data produced by research activities or by the society.
 In order to protect intellectual rights and legiti- mate priority exploitation, data should be disseminated after a limited period of exclusive use (e.g. between 2 and 5 years).
 Private companies operating under state license and producing large quantity of data should make their data available for research (in part or fully).
 When making a contract with a public institution, companies should be made contractually responsible for data dissemination (e.g. of tra c ow data or other recorded data of interest).
 Users should not be forced to agree with a storage, processing and use of information that is not technically required for the services a user wants to get.
 For example, providers of media contents should not force customers to reveal their identities (and e ectively their preferences via the contents they buy), as the contents or services can also be paid for anonymously.
 It would be useful to de ne the individual and corporate responsibilities for damages created in the virtual or real world by activities in the Internet.
 Special procedures should be de ned for cases, where access to original or sensitive anonymized data is justi ed and required (e.g. for certain kinds of research of public interest).
