 We graph trade volume versus message volume across pairs of users in Figure 1, and nd that there is a positive in- creasing relationship between message volume and trade volume.
 Ignoring all pairs of users that only message and do not trade, we see an even more pronounced increasing relationship, displayed in the Message+Trade curve.
 This implies that social product recommendation and in u- ence spreading is most effective when utilized immediately after initial product adoption or purchase.
 Although communication between B1 and B2 is a signi cant in- uence upon information passing, the characteristics of the product itself also affect the success of information passing.
 We can imag- ine that the most important product attribute to consider is the price (in Chinese Yuan, CNY) of the initial purchase.
 For con gurations where X is a buyer and only one of U and V is a seller, s(to) and s(ti) differ by a factor of 2.
 To facilitate our experiments, we perform a web crawl of the Taobao website to ob- tain product and seller metadata associated with the transactions in our original dataset.
 We then investigate the directed triadic closure process and explain how link formation is highly dependent upon the distribu- tion of buyer/seller roles for the nodes of a social commerce net- work.
 Third, we use Taobao review data to demonstrate how high seller ratings are associated with product price premiums, and thus quantify a price for trust.
 Finally, we develop a machine learning model to accurately predict consumer choice, and demonstrate that the social network is the most important feature in predicting how consumers choose their transaction partners.
