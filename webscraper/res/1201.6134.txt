 In this work, we propose a memory biased random walk model on multilayer sequence network, as a generator of synthetic sequential data for recommender systems.
 It would be useful both for contestants and the companies, if the synthetic data could be used for recommendation on real users.
 Random walks [20], [6], [17] have been used for constructing recommender systems on di erent types of graph structures originating from users private data, but not to generate synthetic clickstreams.
 We calculated the DS and CV S matrices from the C dataset and created the synthetic clickstream set C by using the MBRW model.
 Mem- ory parameter m was sampled from the Gaussian distribution N (3, 22), number of random walk hops parameter l was sampled from N (9, 22) and number of synthetic clickstreams parameter K varying from 104 106.
 Upon obtaining the synthetic clickstream set C , we calculated the DS and CV S matrices, and compared their statistical properties to the original matrices DS and CV S.
 We have used the Spearman s rank correlation measure between the corresponding rows in (DS, DS ) and (CV S, CV S ).
 The vertical split, on the other hand, divides clickstream in C into two sets: rst t items are appended to rst set, whereas the rest of the clickstream items belong to a second set.
 These synthetic data generation strategies were mostly developed for database records with a xed number of attributes but not for sequences such as sequence data.
 We propose a novel approach for synthetic sequence generation by construct- ing the memory biased random walk (MBRW) model on the multilevel network of usage sequences.
