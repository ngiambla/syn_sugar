 In this work, we propose a memory biased random walk model on multilayer sequence network, as a generator of synthetic sequential data for recommender systems.
 Random walks [20], [6], [17] have been used for constructing recommender systems on di erent types of graph structures originating from users private data, but not to generate synthetic clickstreams.
 The two characteristic data generator matrices used in this work are the Direct Sequence matrix (DS) and the Common View Score matrix (CV S).
 We examined how statistical properties of the item preference matrix like DS and CV S are preserved in synthetic clickstream set, with respect to the original clickstream set.
 We calculated the DS and CV S matrices from the C dataset and created the synthetic clickstream set C by using the MBRW model.
 Upon obtaining the synthetic clickstream set C , we calculated the DS and CV S matrices, and compared their statistical properties to the original matrices DS and CV S.
 We have used the Spearman s rank correlation measure between the corresponding rows in (DS, DS ) and (CV S, CV S ).
 Now, we analyse the ability to learn recommender system models from syn- thetic data and apply this model on real users.
 We measure and compare the rec- ommender system models learned on real, synthetic and random data and their corresponding performance on recommending items to real users.
 Using the horizontal split on our Yahoo! dataset, we produced a training set Ctrain containing 9000, and a test set Ctest containing 1000 clickstreams.
 From the aggre- gate statistics, they calculated the rst and second order information statistics of symbol distributions in strings, and generated synthetic, pseudo-string data.
