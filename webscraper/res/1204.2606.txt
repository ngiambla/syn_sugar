 Output: d k projection matrix P ; privacy-preserving n k matrix Z, both of which can be pub- lished. 1: Construct random d k projection matrix P . 2: Y := XP 3: Construct random n k noise matrix , based on privacy parameters , and projection matrix P . 4: Z := Y + 5: Publish (P, Z).
 Following Kerckho s s Principle in Cryptography, we assume that the algorithm as well as the parameters n, d, k, , , P and the parameters used in the noise matrix are publicly known. 3.1.2 Choosing desired privacy guarantees The rst decision in utilizing Algorithm 1 (PrivateProjection) is to determine the privacy guarantees desired by the algorithm s curator.
 Each entry of the matrix is chosen independently to be +q 3 k , 0, q 3 tively [1]. k with probability 1 , + 1 k} [1]. 3 , 1 6 , 2 6 , respec- 4.
 As we will see in the proof of privacy in Theorem 1, when using noise from Normal distribution, the amount of noise needed to preserve privacy depends on the choice of the projection matrix P ; and more precisely, on the 2-sensitivity of the chosen P .
 Applying the result j=1 P 2 then kY Y k2 = kX P XPk2 = k(X X) Pk2 max1 i dqPk of Lemma 1 to Y and Y , we obtain the desired privacy guarantee.
 We remark that Theorem 1 applies even if the input matrix X consists of values in [0, 1] instead of Boolean values.
 In Figure 1 we depict the exact relationship between the privacy parameters and , and the variance of the noise needed, by plotting three curves of feasible ( , ) pairs for three choices of .
 Alternatively, one can x the values ( , ) to (1, 0.1) and nd a noise level 1.0 that passes through the point. ,"-"!#(" ,"-"!#(" ,"-"$#!" ,"-"$#!" ,"-"%#!" ,"-"%#!" !#+" !#+" !#*" !#*" !#)" !#)" !#(" !#(" " " ! ! !# " !# " !#&" !#&" !#%" !#%" !#$" !#$" !" !" !" !" !#%" !#%" !# " !# " !#)" !#)" !#+" !#+" $#%" $#%" $# " $# " $#)" $#)" $#+" $#+" %" %" $" $" #" #" Figure 1: Feasible values of , for a given choice of . 3.2.2 Utility guarantees for the Gaussian projection We next discuss the utility guarantees provided by our algorithms.
 Algorithm 1 using the noise matrix whose entries are sampled from N (0, 2) satis es ( , )-di erential privacy if 4 k > 2(ln d + ln(2/ )), pln(1/ ), and Proof.
 According to Theorem 1, ( , /2)-di erential privacy is satis ed if < ln(1/ ). w2(P )p2(ln(1/ ) + ) , (3) where w2(P ) is P s 2-sensitivity.
