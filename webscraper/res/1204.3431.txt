 This paper deals with green cellular networks with the help of multi-layer overlaid hierarchical structure (macro / micro / pico / femto cells).
 Macrocell for area coverage, micro for pedestrian and a slow moving traffic while pico for indoor use and femto for individual high capacity users.
 The decreasing energy efficiency of today s macrocellular technologies with increasing user demand for high data rates is also discussed.
 It is shown that a joint deployment of macro, micro- and publicly accessible residential picocells / femtocells can reduce the total energy consumption by up to 60% in an urban area with today s technology [1].
 It is shown that the benefits of a joint macro- and picocell deployment will increase further as both technologies mature, and will result in a significant reduction of the network energy consumption as the user demand for high data rates increases.
 Energy efficiency in cellular networks is a growing concern for cellular operators to not only maintain profitability, but also to reduce the overall environment effects.
 This emerging trend of achieving energy efficiency in cellular networks is motivating the standardization authorities and network operators to continuously explore future technologies in order to bring improvements in the entire network infrastructure [2].
 In this work, we present a brief survey of methods to improve the power efficiency of cellular networks, explore some research issues and challenges and suggest some techniques to enable an energy efficient or green cellular network.
 A variety of remote RF solutions exist today to help operators provide improved capacity and 4 better quality of service in comparison to other indoor existing available technologies.
 High capacity indoor users have been covered with low power femto cell while hotspots and indoor users will be covered with low power picocell instead of distributed networks to provide much better QoS in comparison to existing wireless technologies for indoor subscribers.
