 My position on this is crystal clear and it can be summarized as: No, you cannot predict elections with Twitter .
 The order is chronological, there are cross-references between papers, and some of them are just provided for the sake of comprehen- siveness.
 Modeling Public Mood and Emotion: Twitter Sentiment and Socio- Economic Phenomena Bollen, J., Pepe, A., and Mao, H. 2009.
 Modeling Public Mood and Emotion: Twitter Sentiment and Socio-Economic Phenomena, in Proceedings of the Fifth International AAAI Conference on Weblogs and Social Media.
 To the best of my knowledge this is the rst paper about the application of mood (not sentiment) analysis to Twitter data.
 This is one of the earliest papers discussing the feasibility of using Twitter data as a substitute for traditional polls.
 Then, raw numbers of positive and negative tweets regarding a given topic are used to compute a sentiment score (the ratio between the number of positive and negative tweets).
 Using this method, sentiment time series were prepared for a number of topics (namely, consumer con dence, presidential approval and US 2008 Presi- dential elections).
 In Proceedings of PASSAT/SocialCom. 6 One of the few papers casting doubts on the presumed predictive powers of Twitter data regarding elections and suggesting the use of incumbency as a baseline for predictions.
 Bermingham and Smeaton put their method to test with the 2011 Irish General Election nding that it is not competitive when compared with traditional polls.
