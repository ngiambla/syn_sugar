 Modeling Public Mood and Emotion: Twitter Sentiment and Socio-Economic Phenomena, in Proceedings of the Fifth International AAAI Conference on Weblogs and Social Media.
 To the best of my knowledge this is the rst paper about the application of mood (not sentiment) analysis to Twitter data.
 This is one of the earliest papers discussing the feasibility of using Twitter data as a substitute for traditional polls.
 O Connor et al. employed the subjectivity lexicon from Opinion Finder to determine both a positive and a negative score for each tweet in their dataset (in their approach tweets can be both positive and negative at the same time).
 Then, raw numbers of positive and negative tweets regarding a given topic are used to compute a sentiment score (the ratio between the number of positive and negative tweets).
 Using this method, sentiment time series were prepared for a number of topics (namely, consumer con dence, presidential approval and US 2008 Presi- dential elections).
