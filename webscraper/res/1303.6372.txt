 In general, we nd that latent friendship ties can be predicted with over 95% accuracy when two individuals have had at least 10 interactions.
 Within the Reach sys- tem, individuals choose from among seven game types and numerous subtypes, which are played over more than 33 terrain maps.
 The subgraph of interactions by our survey participants contained a total of 2,531,479 vertices and 665,401,283 temporal edges over the same period of time.
 We investigate the accuracy of our statistical fea- tures, divided into temporal and cooperative classes and considered individually, for predicting latent ties.
 The expected diurnal and weekly cycles observed in the data will modulate these behaviors, and a reasonable ap- proach for their quanti cation is via interaction period- icity.
 Lightweight predictors of friendship These results suggest that individual features alone may perform well at predicting latent friendships, and such features would make good computationally lightweight predictors that could realistically be deployed on a large-scale system.
 We explore this possibility using logistic regression to build single-feature latent tie classi ers and mea- sure their performance using AUC.
 We then computed the average AUC and its standard error by creating equal sized training and test sets from 10 random permutations of the data in each bin, and ap- plying the individual-feature models.
 The large e ec- tive capacity of an online system means that any signal from autocorrelation is likely to be signi cant.
 The strongly predictive nature of direct assists Ax,y that we observe corroborates this nding, and demonstrates that it holds over a wide range of Nx.
 The temporal features of raw and normalized pair frequencies Nx,y and Nx,y/Nx are less reliable predictors for small histories, but become more reliable as Nx increases.
 The discrim- inatory power of autocorrelation and prosocial behavior, even with sparse data, suggests that latent friendship ties may in fact be easily detectable, due to the nature of friendship itself.
