 We examine the case of China, where online blockage is notoriously comprehensive, and compare Chinese web usage patterns with those elsewhere.
 Analyzing audience traffic among the 1000 most visited websites, we find that websites cluster according to language and geography.
 Among the multilingual websites (that have Chinese language versions) with a global focus, only 2 websites (Xinuhuanet.com and CNTV.com) out of 106 group with the C-Cluster.
 First, these CDMs are essentially communities of websites that share either language or geographical focus and often both.
 The C-Cluster is one such community and is quite similar in its composition of websites to other CDMs such as Japan, South Korea, and Russia.
 Each CDM is a self-sufficient set with a wide variety of websites to satisfy the diet of typical Internet users.
 In particular, we find that the C-Cluster is not restricted to mainland Chinese sites, but also includes websites from Hong Kong and Taiwan.
 It also includes all Hong Kong and Taiwan focused sites, despite the fact that the GFW blocks most of them.
 The effect of the GFW is less clear among websites that have Chinese as one of the languages and a Global geographic focus.
 Of them, the two sites that group with the C-Cluster are Chinese state-run news agency and television network, each attempting a global audience.
