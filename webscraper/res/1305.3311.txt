 We examine the case of China, where online blockage is notoriously comprehensive, and compare Chinese web usage patterns with those elsewhere.
 Analyzing audience traffic among the 1000 most visited websites, we find that websites cluster according to language and geography.
 Chinese websites constitute one cluster, which resembles other such geo-linguistic clusters in terms of both its composition and degree of isolation.
 Further, we examine the specific composition of the Chinese culturally defined market, and find that blockage is a rather limited explanation for it.
 Chinese Internet censorship includes two types of measures: content censorship over domestic websites, and access blockage targeting websites outside the state s jurisdiction.
 Even many global websites with content in multiple languages (such as Facebook and Twitter), mainly owing to their large user-base in the US and UK, are a part of this cluster.
 In general both language and geographic focus of the websites appear to contribute to the isolation of a CDM.
 The last category, with lowest cultural proximity, comprises of sites that neither focus on China nor are available in the Chinese language.
 Among the multilingual websites (that have Chinese language versions) with a global focus, only 2 websites (Xinuhuanet.com and CNTV.com) out of 106 group with the C-Cluster.
 First, these CDMs are essentially communities of websites that share either language or geographical focus and often both.
 The C-Cluster is one such community and is quite similar in its composition of websites to other CDMs such as Japan, South Korea, and Russia.
 Each CDM is a self-sufficient set with a wide variety of websites to satisfy the diet of typical Internet users.
