 The task for this experiment is that of clustering protomemes using a single similarity measure, namely content similarity.
 Hierarchical clustering outperforms K-means over a broad range of values for the number of clusters, and also achieves a better overall cluster quality.
 While the experiment reported in Fig. 4 is based on protomemes and content similarity, we systematically explored other measures.
 The similarity measure adopted to compare tweets and aggregate them is content similarity based on TF-IDF.
 Such information is very time-consuming to obtain and this task seems unfeasible in real-time, streaming scenarios.
 The proposed diffusion similarity measure uses mention and retweet information, that can be reconstructed in real-time from the observed data, considering each protomeme diffusion set.
 We carried out a systematic evaluation showing the promising performance of the clus- tering framework, by using a manually-curated dataset as a ground truth.
