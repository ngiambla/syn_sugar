 The appropriate granularity of a meme, however, is hardly captured from existing entities such as tags and keywords.
 Here we present a framework for the novel task of detecting memes by clustering messages from large streams of social data.
 We de ne several similarity measures between memes, leveraging various content, metadata, and network features of tweets; and we propose different ways to combine them for clustering memes.
 DESPIC architecture for meme clustering and classi cation We compare multiple clustering algorithms, nding that hierarchical clustering outperforms K-means in terms of the trade-off between quality of the clusters and their number and size.
 This process allows for tuning the performance of hierarchical clustering to nd the correct trade-off between number and size of clusters, as shown in Fig. 3.
 The baseline achieves its best performance for a number of clusters that is comparable to the number of tweets, which is not very helpful in our setting.
 This con guration, however, might not be viable for our task in the streaming scenario.
 The MAX strategy obtains its best performance for a much smaller number of clusters, even out- performing Baseline+Followers when the number of clusters is closer to that in the ground truth.
 We ran the hierarchical clustering algorithm for each set of weights in a 3-dimensional simplex with step 0.1, resulting in 286 parameter con gurations.
 Our work instead focuses on the assessment of the quality of the meme clustering process, and allows for overlapping memes.
