 They are continually chang- ing and often re ect exogenous events that happen in the real world.
 Trends are localized in space and time as they are driven by activity in speci c geographic areas that act as sources of tra c and information ow.
 Taken indepen- dently, trends and geography have been discussed in recent literature on online social media; although, so far, little has been done to characterize the relation between trends and geography.
 This data allows us to study the origins and pathways of trends, how they com- pete for popularity at the local level to emerge as winners at the country level, and what dynamics underlie their pro- duction and consumption in di erent geographic areas.
 These hubs act as trendsetters, generating topics that eventually trend at the country level, and driving the conversation across the country.
 This poses an intriguing conjecture, drawing a parallel between the spread of information and diseases: Do trends travel faster by airplane than over the Internet?
 In 3.1 we provide a statistical characterization of trends, describing how they are distributed in space and time.
 In 3.2 we highlight a locality e ect in the trend shar- ing patterns: geographically close cities share similar trends.
