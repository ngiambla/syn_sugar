 Treatment is highly speci c for di erent patients, so a general practitioner must have a high complexity to attend patients with diverse conditions.
 Concerning most preventive services, these are similar for most patients and thus can be delivered e ciently by providers with a lower complexity [10].
 A similar approach can be used to study education and its complexity: a successful educational system has to match the complexity of its students.
 As the group grows in size and diversity, its complexity will increase, demanding a greater teacher complexity or limiting the complexity of the class.
 Di erent solutions which have been applied to overcome this inherent limitation are illustrated in Fig. 1 and can be classi ed by: 1 Quantity.
 Technology is allowing us to increase the complexity of the teaching system, potentially harnessing the complexity of hundreds of institutions and thousands of teachers to deliver education to millions of students.
 The strict di erence between teacher delivering education and student receiving education is changing towards a more distributed framework, where teachers and students form a co- learning community.
 Wikipedia, online libraries, and sites such as Khan Academy [16] provide material for students and teachers which e ectively can increase the complexity of the education delivered.
 Tech- nology is having a similar role for coordinating our individual e orts [19] and increasing the complexity of the educational system.
 Correlation is not causation, but few would disagree that improving the education of the world is a necessary step in attending global problems.
