 Nevertheless, information technology is allowing us to go beyond the complexity of the teacher and beyond the complexity of the school.
 Technology is allowing us to increase the complexity of the teaching system, potentially harnessing the complexity of hundreds of institutions and thousands of teachers to deliver education to millions of students.
 The strict di erence between teacher delivering education and student receiving education is changing towards a more distributed framework, where teachers and students form a co- learning community.
 Technology is serving as a mediator, coordinating e orts and demands of agents in an increasingly global educational system.
 Tech- nology is having a similar role for coordinating our individual e orts [19] and increasing the complexity of the educational system.
 Technology not only allows to have instant com- munication and personalized content delivered individually, but it is turing the complexity limitation of education on its back, as illustrated in Fig. 2: Quantity.
 Diverse students can obtain di erent content, suited to their abilities and require- ments.
 With a broad diversity of content to choose from, this can be selected to maximize student learning and satisfaction.
 Even when information technology o ers promising improvements for our educational systems, several economic, political, social, and cultural challenges lie ahead.
 One of them is language, although communities are providing translation of educational content and En- glish is becoming a lingua franca.
