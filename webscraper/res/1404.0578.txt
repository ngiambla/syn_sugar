 We ﬁrst constructed an online social network structure based on patient-to-patient ties among 200 patients obtained from PLM.
 We then characterized patients' online social activities by measuring the numbers of posts and views and helpful marks each patient obtained.
 Furthermore, we re-collected the patients' recovery data two months after the ﬁrst data collection.
 In this paper, we study potential linkages between online social behaviors of patients with mental health disorders and their recovery processes.
 The in- and out- degrees are the numbers of links that go into and out of the node, respectively.
 These numbers are the only available numbers online that relate to patients' general social activities.
 The data about patients' recovery processes were obtained from patients' self-reported health records in PLM.
 Table 3 shows the correlation coeﬃcients between the two online social ac- tivities and recovery outcomes.
 Similarly, the number of posts and views patients made was also signiﬁcantly correlated with improvements in the same set of recovery outcomes.
 The new model explained 17.3% of variance in the recovery outcomes (R2 = 0.173).
 The beta coeﬃcients for both helpful marks and posts and views were signiﬁcant at the 0.05 level.
 It was suggested that the numbers of helpful marks and views and posts were associated with the future recovery of patients with mental disorders.
 Discussions and Conclusions In this study, we investigated possible relationships between the behaviors of patients with mental health disorders in online social media and their recovery outcomes over time.
 The result showed that the number of helpful marks was correlated with the patients' recovery outcomes.
 The result showed that the numbers of both helpful marks and views and posts were signiﬁcantly correlated with the patients' recovery outcomes.
