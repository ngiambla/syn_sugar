 We rst constructed an online social network structure based on patient-to-patient ties among 200 patients obtained from PLM.
 We then characterized patients' online social activities by measuring the numbers of posts and views and helpful marks each patient obtained.
 We found signi cant correlations between the patients' social behaviors and the second recovery data, which were col- lected two months apart.
 In this paper, we study potential linkages between online social behaviors of patients with mental health disorders and their recovery processes.
 The data about patients' recovery processes were obtained from patients' self-reported health records in PLM.
 We visualized the patient-to-patient social network structure and calculated important node properties.
 Table 3 shows the correlation coe cients between the two online social ac- tivities and recovery outcomes.
 The beta coe cients for both helpful marks and posts and views were signi cant at the 0.05 level.
 Overall, the results of Study II revealed that some online social behaviors were signi cantly correlated with patients' recovery outcomes collected two months later.
 The result showed that the number of helpful marks was correlated with the patients' recovery outcomes.
 The result showed that the numbers of both helpful marks and views and posts were signi cantly correlated with the patients' recovery outcomes.
