 We rst constructed an online social network structure based on patient-to-patient ties among 200 patients obtained from PLM.
 We then characterized patients' online social activities by measuring the numbers of posts and views and helpful marks each patient obtained.
 The patients' recovery data were obtained from their self-reported status information that was also available on PLM.
 We found that some node properties (in-degree, eigenvector centrality and PageRank) and the two online so- cial activity measures were signi cantly correlated with patients' recovery.
 We found signi cant correlations between the patients' social behaviors and the second recovery data, which were col- lected two months apart.
 Our results indicated that social interactions in online communities such as PLM were signi cantly associated with the current and future recoveries of patients with mental disorders.
 Patients' social network structure and social activities are the two aspects of online social behaviors considered, whose impact on the recovery of mental disorders were in- vestigated.
 We visualized the patient-to-patient social network structure and calculated important node properties.
 In the following paragraphs, we conducted a series of statistic analyses to examine the relationship between patients' online social behaviors and their recovery outcomes.
 To sum up, in this paper, we investigated the association between typi- cal online social behaviors and recovery outcomes of mental disorders.
