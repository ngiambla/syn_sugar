 Instagram exhibits a mixture of features including social structure, social tag- ging and media sharing.
 The network of social interac- tions among users models various dynamics including fol- lower/followee relations and users communication by means of posts/comments.
 Users can upload and tag media such as photos and pictures, and they can like and comment each piece of information on the platform.
 Our nal research question (Q5) aims at exploring the topical interests space of users and how this a ects their popularity.
 We exploited users signals in the form of relationships and interactions to investigate a number of research questions spanning network-, semantic- and topical- based analysis on users, media and how these two dimensions are interrelated.
