 Here we focus on Instagram, a media- sharing online platform whose popularity has been rising up to gathering hundred millions users.
 Instagram exhibits a mixture of features including social structure, social tag- ging and media sharing.
 The network of social interac- tions among users models various dynamics including fol- lower/followee relations and users communication by means of posts/comments.
 Users can upload and tag media such as photos and pictures, and they can like and comment each piece of information on the platform.
 In this work we inves- tigate three major aspects on our Instagram dataset: (i) the structural characteristics of its network of heterogeneous in- teractions, to unveil the emergence of self organization and topically-induced community structure; (ii) the dynamics of content production and consumption, to understand how global trends and popular users emerge; (iii) the behavior of users labeling media with tags, to determine how they de- vote their attention and to explore the variety of their topical interests.
 As previously discussed, our dataset is intentionally built around the set of users and media that belong to a competition- driven, large, community in Instagram.
 We want to determine what patterns of tag adoption users follow, in terms of how many total tags they use, and how many of these tags are distinct.
 In other words, we establish their vocabulary size (i.e., the number of words they are aware of) and we compare it against the total number of tags they produce.
