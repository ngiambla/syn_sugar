 While larger teams tend to be more successful, workload is highly focused across the team, with only a few members performing most work.
 The rest of this paper is organized as follows: In Sec. 2 we describe our GitHub dataset; give de nitions of a team, team success, and work activity/focus of a team member; and introduce metrics to measure various aspects of the experience and experiential diversity of a team s members.
 In Sec. 4 we present statistical tests on linear regression models of team features to control for potential confounds between team features and team success.
 E ective team size (cid:80)M The number of team members, M, does not fully represent the size of a team since the distribution of work may be highly skewed across team members.
 This correlation may be due to more team members driving project success or success may act as a mechanism to recruit team members.
 For example, in one scenario a team member may be a community manager merging in large numbers of external contributions from non-team members.
 Within this subset of teams, dominated teams had signi cantly higher S than non-dominated teams (Mann-Whitney U test with continuity correction, p < 10 8).
 This e ective size can be roughly thought of as the average number of unique contributors per unit time and need not be a whole number.
 The relationship between D and S was even stronger for larger teams (Fig. 3 inset), implying that larger teams can more e ectively translate this diversity into success.
 A team with many leads will bring considerable experience, but most of its members may also be unable to dedicate their full attention to the team.
 Team members should be both specialists, acting as the lead contributor to a team, and generalists, 14 o ering ancillary support for teams led by another member.
