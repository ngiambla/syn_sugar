 These carriers need to understand the determinants of churn to con dently apply e ective retention strategies to ensure their pro tability and growth.
 In this paper, we look at the e ect of peer in uence on churn and we try to dis- entangle it from other e ects that drive simultaneous churn across friends but that do not relate to peer in uence.
 We apply survival models and generalized propensity score to identify the role of peer in uence.
 We show that the propensity to churn increases when friends do and that it increases more when many strong friends churn.
 With average acquisition costs reaching $600 per subscriber churn may cost the wireless in- dustry billions of dollars every year [3].
 We are particularly interested in the association between number of friends who churn and the propensity to churn.
 Therefore, we use n-call f rd churn, the friends who churn that exchange at least n calls with the ego in the same cal- endar month.
 Egos can be subject to di er- ent amounts of treatment as they see more or fewer friends churn.
 We estimate the dose response function and derive the marginal treatment e ect relative to having no friends that churn.
 We ob- serve that having more friends churn increases the likelihood of churn for any n considered in our analysis.
