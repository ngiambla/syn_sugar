 We apply survival models and generalized propensity score to identify the role of peer in uence.
 For this purpose, they proac- tively identify subscribers with high propensity to churn, evaluate the underlying reasons for churn and devise strate- gies to prevent it.
 The perplexing nature of churn, however, makes it very di cult to explain and address churn in an e cient and comprehensive manner.
 We apply survival analysis and generalized propensity score to separate peer in uence from homophily and measure the e ect of the former.
 We are particularly interested in the association between number of friends who churn and the propensity to churn.
 Therefore, we use n-call f rd churn, the friends who churn that exchange at least n calls with the ego in the same cal- endar month.
 TEP needs to be su ciently large so that we can observe treatment and, in particular, several intensities of treatment.
 We estimate the dose response function and derive the marginal treatment e ect relative to having no friends that churn.
 These di erent de nitions allow for estimating the e ect of churn from strong vs. weak friends.
 We control for the subscribers tenure with the carrier, cell phone usage, monthly expenditure and the size of the social network.
 This means that homophily is likely to drive a signi cant amount of the correlation between churn and friends churn that a simple survival analysis is unable to disentangle.
