 In addition to completing the normal requirements for a PhD, students would undergo an intense, several year training period designed to expose them to the core vocabulary of multiple subjects at the graduate level.
 Finally, I discuss alternative possibil- ities for training generalists by taking advantage of contemporary developments in online learning and open science. 1 Introduction In the age of highly specialized science, the generalist is a long forgotten job description.
 For adequately prepared students, I believe that after completion of the requirements for their home department in their rst or second year, students would be able pass 4 additional qualifying examinations over the course of 2-3 years, after which they would resume their PhD research and complete their degree.
 The choice of the qualifying examination as the focal point for this program is that it encapsulates the basic vocabulary of a eld, the core knowledge required to conduct in depth research.
 The aim of this program is emphatically not to train researchers who have in depth, specialized knowledge of 5 di erent subjects that would be an unreasonable, if not outright impossible goal.
 Rather, the aim is to train stu- dents who understand the culture, the basic tools, and broad perspectives of multiple subjects, so that they 2 can contribute to strengthening the very foundations of the scienti c establishment.
 I chose this number because it would allow for individual students to engage with multiple, quite di erent subjects over the course of their graduate education, and because 6-8 month blocks per subject would create a program roughly on par with the length of an MD/PhD.
 While this program may seem daunting, I would like to emphasize that individuals who pursue MD/PhD degrees and ultimately become board certi ed in a medical specialty need to pass a similar array of hurdles in addition to PhD requirements for their research training they have to pass multiple levels of board exam- inations to become licensed physicians.
 It is also important to keep in mind that the training program described here is a graduate level train- ing program, and consequently, should be thought of as being the rst step in a career-long trajectory.
 Venture capital might be another place where scienti c generalists could have a signi cant impact, play- ing the role of bridge builders between academia and industry, and perhaps actively managing their own portfolios and overseeing scienti c startup incubators.
