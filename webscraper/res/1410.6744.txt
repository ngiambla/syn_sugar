 We showed people a list of science stories and asked them to vote for, or recommend, ones they found interesting.
 We measured the degree to which displaying the number of prior votes, which acts as the social signal, affects the votes stories 2 T.
 Lerman / Human Computation (2015) 1:1 receive, after controlling for their content and position within the list shown to users.
 We used the model (Section 4.1) to adjust for position bias when determining Pr(click|view) in the absence of the social signal.
 Second, the ratio is larger for larger signals, i.e., a user is relatively more likely to click on stories with larger social in uence signals.
 By comparison, the observed values for activity with social in uence are considerably larger, suggesting those values are unlikely to arise if the social signal had no effect on inequality.
 Quantifying the response as a function of the size of the social signal requires identifying how users attend to social signals.
 For each quartile, this gave the actual number of votes, the expected number and the number of instances (i.e., number of times a story was shown to users with a signal in each quartile).
 Speci cally, the correlation between number of votes and appeal is 0.77 and 0.79 for activity ordering, without and with social signals, respectively.
 Moreover, this was achieved with substantially less user effort, as measured by the number of url clicks and votes.
