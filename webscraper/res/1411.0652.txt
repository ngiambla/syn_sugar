 Here we describe a streaming framework for online detection and clustering of memes in social media, speci cally Twitter.
 A pre-clustering procedure, namely protomeme detection, rst isolates atomic tokens of information carried by the tweets.
 The clustering algorithm takes into account various dimen- sions of the data and metadata, including natural language, the social network, and the patterns of information di usion.
 As a result, our sys- tem can build clusters of semantically, structurally, and topically related tweets.
 The clustering process is based on a variant of Online K-means that incorporates a memory mechanism, used to forget old memes and replace them over time with the new ones.
 We can now de ne a set of similarity measures based on content and metadata.
 Common user similarity Su between protomemes p and q is the cosine sim- ilarity (1) Su(p, q) = pu qu ||pu||||qu|| 6 where pu and qu are the vectors representing the number of tweets in p and q, respectively, produced by each user.
 Let A be the correct cluster assignment, and suppose that it contains cA clusters.
 Let B be the output of a clustering algorithm operating on the same data and producing cB clusters.
 Each bin is one hour. rows correspond to the clusters in A and whose columns represent clusters in B.
