 Here we describe a streaming framework for online detection and clustering of memes in social media, speci cally Twitter.
 As a result, our sys- tem can build clusters of semantically, structurally, and topically related tweets.
 On the other hand, social media are also used to disseminate misleading information such as rumors and spam [13, 20, 37].
 In other words, our proposed approach bene ts from protomemes as a pre-aggregation step and then it clusters them to identify memes.
 In such a case, the algorithm assumes unlimited access to all data points as well as boundless memory and processing resources.
 In all cases, without loss of generality, we assume the stream to start at time t = 0 and discretize time into steps of xed duration t.
 The closest cluster is chosen based on the distance between the arriving point and the centroid of the cluster.
 This is due to the characteristic fast-paced churning time of the topics of discussion in social media.
 In our framework, we proposed to rely on mention and retweet di usion sets, which can be inferred in real time from the observed data.
 Also, our system provides better performance by pre-clustering based on protomemes and by metadata-driven measures of similarity between clusters.
