 Applying a regression strategy, we obtain a mean deviation for the predictions between 0.5 and 0.7 in the range [1-5] for the computed social signals.
 Once data from the environment have been acquired and processed to de ne a set of behavioral features, they serve as the basis for modelling a set of communication indicators.
 For instance, in [31], the authors outline a system for real-time tracking of the human body with the objective of interpreting human behavior.
 However, in the context of conversations we are particularly interested in behavioral traits belonging to social signals captured in the communication and in the interactions between the participants in the VOM sessions.
 As explained in section II, the observations of the classi- cation task are the accuracies achieved by the system when predicting receptivity, agreement, and satisfaction.
 Then, the correlation can be observed between the observations predicted by the system and the impressions recorded by the mediators.
 These opinions are quanti ed values of receptivity, agreement, and satisfaction presented in relation to the parties involved in the VOM session, and represent the ground truth of our system.
 In this setting, we also ran the experiment twice: rst, we considered all features, and then UNDER CONSIDERATION AT PATTERN RECOGNITION LETTERS 13 features using audio-RGB-depth data.
 Finally, we have de ned an automatic computation of behavioral indicators used as nal features for learning and classi cation tasks.
 We have demonstrated the applicability of the system for use in the restorative justice eld as a tool for mediators, obtaining recognition accuracies of 86% when predicting satisfaction and 79% when predicting both agreement and receptivity, and a high correlation in the regression analysis.
