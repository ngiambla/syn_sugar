 Once data from the environment have been acquired and processed to de ne a set of behavioral features, they serve as the basis for modelling a set of communication indicators.
 Constraints of the main condition at the center of the owchart are denoted by , , , and their respective thresholds , , .
 The counting variables are F N , F P , h , representing the accumulated number of false negatives, false positives, and hits for the current person .
 The correction of false positives and false negatives is shown, improving the continuity of the detection of positive regions of interest between consecutive frames.
 On the other hand, if a session involves just one party and the mediator, we introduce only one sample corresponding to the party involved.
 As explained in section II, the observations of the classi- cation task are the accuracies achieved by the system when predicting receptivity, agreement, and satisfaction.
 Tables IV and V show the results obtained when employing the different techniques and using the complete set of behavioral indicators in Table III.
 However, both hand agitation, gaze, and the combination of the two are chosen as being the most relevant features when predicting receptivity.
 This means that these are the most discriminating behav- ioral indicators in the prediction of the degree of receptivity, agreement, and satisfaction in a conversation such as that maintained in a VOM process.
 Finally, we have de ned an automatic computation of behavioral indicators used as nal features for learning and classi cation tasks.
 Weighted feature selection when using AdaBoost and SVM for the grouping response cases presenting the highest accuracy when predicting receptivity, agreement, and satisfaction.
