 Pluses of this approach include fast money earning, and that the K virality factor (K-factor, Reichheld, 2003) can be less than one (discussed below). 2.
 It is necessary to ensure that the virality coefficient (the K-factor) is significant, which for a number of products is difficult and 3 even unattainable.
 For practical purposes some sources used only new users (dNU) as a base, comparing all users attracted virality with all types of new users.
 For example, purchased 100 paying users get involved in the viral mechanics and invite additional 50 users, which reduced the average price of each user and saved the budget.
 If the K-factor is greater than 1 (say it is 200%), it leads to the geometric progression growth of the user base.
 For example, purchased 100 users attract 200 new people, and if the K-factor remains the same, the new users will attract 400 new people, and so on.
 Virality works as long as the entire mass of potential users will not reach saturation in their social matrix and a given market.
 Virality, retention and monetization relationship In his book Freemium Economics, Eric Benjamin Seufert (Seufert, 2014) in the Virality and Retention section, on page 175 said: Virality and retention exist on opposite sides of the acquisition 7 threshold: virality describes how users are introduced to a product, and retention describes how long users remain with a product.
 The opposite situation of poor virality with excellent retention leads to the product and its user base stagnation, and eventual defeat by the competitors.
 Coefficient of the product audience growth, K-growth, can be expressed as a sum of the coefficients of the viral K-factor and the retention factor, K-retention: K growth = K factor + K retention (6) Equation 6 is the main formula of the freemium product growth, based on the viral spreading.
