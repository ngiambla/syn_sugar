 Osipov) Abstract The paper describes gamification, virality and retention in the freemium educational online platform with 40,000 users as an example.
 Moreover, the cost of at- tracting new users can be substantial, and there is a risk not to recover this high cost from monetization.
 Pluses of this approach include fast money earning, and that the K virality factor (K-factor, Reichheld, 2003) can be less than one (discussed below). 2.
 For example, purchased 100 paying users get involved in the viral mechanics and invite additional 50 users, which reduced the average price of each user and saved the budget.
 If the K-factor is greater than 1 (say it is 200%), it leads to the geometric progression growth of the user base.
 Users with high product loyalty get increasingly involved in the mechanics of virality and monetization (Fields & Cotton, 2012; Eyal & Hoover (2014).
 The opposite situation of poor virality with excellent retention leads to the product and its user base stagnation, and eventual defeat by the competitors.
 If the K-growth factor is less than one, then the product can not grow and looses users with all the consequences for the product and its team.
