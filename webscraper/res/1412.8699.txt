 These regimes depend up the number of rules (N) and the minimum latitude (Lmin) required by a normal individual to carry out their activities.
 The Toy Model is then mapped onto the standard 1D Percolation Model from theoretical physics and the same behavior is observed.
 The costs of these approaches are a key aspect of their adoption and there is active research to develop technologies that minimize their limitations [Kepner et al 2014].

 IMPLICATIONS The qualitative agreement between the Toy Model and the Percolation Model allows the Toy Model to be connected with far more complex models.
 For example, in more complex percolation models the percolation threshold Pc gets smaller as the model gets more complex (see Figure 8).
 This would mean that Nmin becomes smaller in more complex systems and that insider threat latitude starts increasing with a smaller number of rules.
