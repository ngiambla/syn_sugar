 This paper creates a Toy Model of a work environment and examines it with respect to the latitude provided to a normal individual and the latitude provided to an insider threat.
 These regimes depend up the number of rules (N) and the minimum latitude (Lmin) required by a normal individual to carry out their activities.
 The Toy Model is then mapped onto the standard 1D Percolation Model from theoretical physics and the same behavior is observed.
 This allows the Toy Model to be generalized to a wide array of more complex models that have been well studied by the theoretical physics community and also show the same behavior.
 As before, all the threat latitudes must sum to 1 so that the average threat latitude is given by Lthreat = 1/(Nthreat + 1) A simulation of the Toy Model behavior is shown in Figure 2.
 As expected, the insider threat latitude first decreases with the number rules, reaches a minimum, and then increases as the number of rules increases.

 Toy Model and Percolation Model. (a) Toy Model with three latitudes where L1 < Lmin. (b) Percolation Model that is equivalent to the Toy Model in (a).
 This would mean that Nmin becomes smaller in more complex systems and that insider threat latitude starts increasing with a smaller number of rules.
 SUMMARY & FUTURE WORK Rules are the primary means of coordinating the activities of individuals who have a variety of goals and purposes.
