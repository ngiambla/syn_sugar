 In this paper a proposal is given to determine prices on electricity markets taking into account the operational exibility of power plants, such that the costs of long-term capacity reserves can be paid by short-term electricity spot markets.
 Thus the costs of operational in exibility are market externalities [3, 14], [20, p 125] and reduce welfare.
 By contrast, a sustainable electricity market mechanism de- sign should induce market prices which take into account both the direct variable production costs and the external ecologi- cal costs of electricity production, but also the costs caused by operational in exibility of each individual power plant.
 This measure then can be used to compute an in exibility fee for each power plant.
 The total of these in exibility fees then can serve to pay power reserves provided by some given capacity mechanism.
 Assume then that there are k power plants participating on the capacity market, each one established with a unique index i = 1, . . . , k.
 For this purpose the concept of a general measure of operational exibility of a power plant is intro- duced here as a strictly monotonically decreasing function j of the guaranteed start-up time, normed by condition (1).
 With such a measure, the in exibility is priced in by Equation (3) to the marginal price determining the sell bid of each power plant at the spot market.
 The amount depends on a market- wide reference level price p0 which is set by the market au- thority or the state.
 The total operational in exibility fee Cf accumulated at the spot markets then is spread on the power plants participating in a given capacity mechanism, depend- ing on their operational exibilities according to Equation (7).
