 For this purpose, a measure of operational exibility is introduced enabling to compute an in exibility fee charging each individual power plant on a wholesale electricity spot market.
 To internal- ize it into price calculation, at rst we de ne measure for the operational exibility of a given power plant.
 In the limit case that all power plants participating on the spot market are equally op- erationally exible, i.e., j i = const, all sell bids are raised by the same amount and the merit order cannot change.
 The reference level price are assumed as p0 = 10 e/MWh and p0 = 70 e/MWh, respectively.
 For a given demand q of electric power, the market-clearing spot price increases more or less slightly, depending on p0.
 A further natural requirement is that a power plant offering its reliability on the capacity market cannot partici- pate on the spot market.
 For this purpose the concept of a general measure of operational exibility of a power plant is intro- duced here as a strictly monotonically decreasing function j of the guaranteed start-up time, normed by condition (1).
 With such a measure, the in exibility is priced in by Equation (3) to the marginal price determining the sell bid of each power plant at the spot market.
 The amount depends on a market- wide reference level price p0 which is set by the market au- thority or the state.
 Using this measure, the spot market and the corresponding payments to power plants 5 participating in a capacity mechanism are applied to a simple but prototypical toy grid in Examples 1 and 2.
