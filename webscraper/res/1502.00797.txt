 Here, the richness of information will be more profound at close proximity to people , but will deplete and become less interesting and useful as the proximity zone expands.
 Analytics services will be willing to pay for the integrated data they consume, and may charge con- sumers of the analytics.
 The nal set of entities would be: (f) data brokers that help with data discovery and payment of data owners for consumed data, and negotiation of data movement; (g) service brokers that help with the discovery of analytics or integration services and their payment, and negotiation of service deployment/movement; (h) analytics consumers who are willing to pay for the analytics service.
 This disparity is a re ection of the di erences in infrastructure, cost of access, telecom networks and services, and policies among di erent economies.
 Hence, the cost and technology behind the sensing, device, networking and analytic solutions for the IoT should be a ordable and scale to billions of users.
 This requires reuse of commodity hardware and sensors, and ex- isting infrastructure in novel ways rather than custom solu- tions with cutting-edge capabilities, or canned solutions de- veloped for advanced economies.
 What it enables is scaling in both directions up and down, and the ability to look at ourselves and the world in an unprecedented degree of detail.
 The data plane will o er channel models (e.g., event driven, sam- ple and hold, etc.,) as a universal abstraction for input/output to the physical and virtual space of the sensing layer.
 The control plane will be responsible for managing the sensor/ network and providing a standardized life-cycle for the dis- covery, con guration and use of the channel models.
 The combination enables the creation of the plug-n-play infras- tructure (across platforms from multiple vendors) necessary for interoperability and successful deployment of large-scale systems.
