 This demonstrates that the current IoT services will tend to become more and more like traditional web services (i.e., Web of Things [8]).
 The availability of such marketplaces is cru- cial for the dissemination of software innovations in gen- eral, and IoT innovations in particular [35].
 According to McKinsey5, busi- nesses already collect tremendous volume of sensor data but the data is only used for anomaly detection and con- trol.
 However, data should also be used for optimization and prediction which provide the greater value, but busi- nesses may lack the expertise to analyze and process their data.
 This justi es the need for the development of new marketplaces for IoT data that will thrive new business interactions (i.e., business-to-business).
 The platform o ers the possibility of charging for the data consumption either by a time-de ned sub- scription or by the amount of data to be consumed.
 Platform 14: Ericsson IoT-Framework (https://github. com/EricssonResearch/iot-framework-engine) The Ericsson IoT-Framework is a PaaS that accumu- lates sensor data from IP networks and focuses on the an- alytics and the mashing up of the data.
 The privacy of data visualization is either public or private, data is always private (needs private keys at all times to use the API).
 Platform 27: realTime.io (https://www.realtime.io/) IoBridge realTime.io provides a proprietary cloud- based platform (PaaS) to connect devices to the Internet and build applications upon the data.
 As realTime.io uses 9 https://fred.sensetecnic.com/ a proprietary transport protocol for data, ioDP, the phys- ical devices need to be connected to the realTime.io cloud service via a proprietary gateway.
