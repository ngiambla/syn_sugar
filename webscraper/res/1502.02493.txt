 In this situation, it is more di cult to infer the norms on the basis of the information exchanged, since random users exchange appropriate and inappropriate information indistinctly.
 For each execution, we calculated the messages that exchange inappropriate information and the messages that disseminate sensitive information.
 Figure 5 displays the average percentage of messages sent by obedient users (who make use of the IAAs) that exchange inappropriate information and disseminate sensitive infor- mation per ratio of compliant agents.
 This gure shows that the exchange of inappropriate information and the dissemination of sensitive information are reduced noticeable as the ratio of compliant users increases.
 For example, when there are 40% of compliant users (which implies that there are 10% of obedient and 50% of random users) in each context the exchange of inappropriate information is reduced by 35% and the dissemination of sen- sitive information is reduced by 27%.
 Figure 12 displays the average percentage of messages sent by each type of users that exchange inappropriate information per number of steps that the simulation is executed.
 As the number of steps increases, users have received more pieces of information and they have more options to violate information sharing norms.
 As illustrated by these gures, all users that use IAAs (i.e., obedient and relationship-based) exchange signi cantly less inappropriate information and disseminate signi cantly less sensitive information than random users.
 Speci cally, obedient users are the ones that violate less information sharing norms (obedient users achieve a reduction on norm violations over 70%).
 This demonstrates that thanks to IAAs, obedient and relationship-based users, who don t know the information sharing norms, are able to comply with them.
