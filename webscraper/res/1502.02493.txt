 Figure 3 shows the behaviour exhibited by random and obedient users in terms of the exchange of inappropriate information.
 This gure depicts the average number of messages that exchange inappropriate information sent by all obedient users and by all random users per ratio of compliant agents.
 This gure shows that obedient users (who make use of IAAs) exchange less inappropriate information than random users (who do not use IAAs) regardless of the ratio of compliant users.
 In this situation, it is more di cult to infer the norms on the basis of the information exchanged, since random users exchange appropriate and inappropriate information indistinctly.
 For each execution, we calculated the messages that exchange inappropriate information and the messages that disseminate sensitive information.
 Figure 5 displays the average percentage of messages sent by obedient users (who make use of the IAAs) that exchange inappropriate information and disseminate sensitive infor- mation per ratio of compliant agents.
 This gure shows that the exchange of inappropriate information and the dissemination of sensitive information are reduced noticeable as the ratio of compliant users increases.
 Figure 11 shows the behaviour exhibited by random users and obedient users in terms of the exchange of inappropriate information.
 The average percentage of messages sent by random users that exchange inappropriate information decreases as the percentage of mali- cious users increases.
 As the number of steps increases, users have received more pieces of information and they have more options to violate information sharing norms.
 As illustrated by these gures, all users that use IAAs (i.e., obedient and relationship-based) exchange signi cantly less inappropriate information and disseminate signi cantly less sensitive information than random users.
