 Moreover, service providers and users still face many significant challenges introduced by the dynamism of software service environments and requirements.
 This requires new concepts, methods, models, and technologies along with flexible and adaptive infrastructure for services developments and management in order to facilitate the on- demand integration of services across different platforms and organizations.
 We propose a framework, called SATIS (Semantically AnnotaTed Intentions for Services) [1], to capture and organize know-how about Web Services business combination.
 We can see traditional entities of the map model (to express and capture goals) : Map, Section, Strategy and Goal.
 In Illustration 2, we can see, at the top, an example of a map which is a graphical way to express and capture goals of end-users.
 The whole framework relies in reusable and combinable elements which can be shared out inside the scope of a community of users.
 In our approach, we adopt Web semantic languages and models as a unified framework to deal with (i) high-level end-user's intentional requirements, (ii) generic Web Service descriptions and (iii) Web Service descriptions themselves.
