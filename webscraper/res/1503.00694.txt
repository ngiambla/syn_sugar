 Let f be a composition-consistent PSCF, A, B F(U ), R R|A, and (A, B).
 Let A = {a, b} and f be a PSCF that satis es composition-consistency.
 Since A is a component in R , we have p + (1 )c f (R |{a,c}) a f (R |A) = f (R ).
 We have shown before that f (R ) = (A) if R (a, b) = 1/2.
 Let f be a PSCF that satis es population-consistency and composition- consistency and A F(U ).
 We de ne R(< 1)S <, S = 2X< where the sum is taken over all < such that {a, b} is not a component in < and 0 < R(<) R(< 1) (in case R(<) = R(< 1) we pick one of < and < 1 arbitrarily).
 Finally, composition-consistency entails a f (R |A\{b}) a f (R |{a,b}) = f (R ).
 In summary, a f (S <) for all < L(A) and a f (R ).
 Let f be a PSCF that satis es population-consistency and composition-consistency and A F(U ) with |A| = n.
 Let f be a PSCF that satis es population-consistency and composition- consistency and A A F(U ).
 Since 0 6 X and 0 6 Y, lin(X) has dimension |A|! |A | + 1 and lin(Y) has dimension |A |.
