 To meet the call for scale, openness, and diversity in aca- demic datasets, we take the opportunity in this article to present a new multimedia dataset containing 100 million media objects and explain the rationale behind its creation.
 We discuss the implications it has for science, research, en- gineering and development, and demonstrate its usefulness towards tackling a broad range of problems in various do- mains.
 However, we note that camera clocks are not always set to the correct date and time, and some photos and videos even erroneously re- port they were captured in the distant past or in the future.
 Figure 1 plots the moments of capture and upload of photos and videos during the period 2000-2014, which accounts for 99.6% of the media objects in the dataset.
 Together these photos and videos form approximately half of the dataset, and the re- mainder is composed of CC photos randomly selected from the entire pool of photos on Flickr.
 This notwithstanding, our dataset appears to overall exhibit similar characteristics to photos and videos present in the entire Flickr corpus. 2.4 Features and Annotations Computing features for 100 million media items is a time- consuming and computationally expensive task.
 Also, di erent elds of research, engineering and science have dif- ferent data requirements and evaluation needs, and all 100 million media objects in the dataset are not likely to be needed for each and every study.
 Such selection logic should examine one or both of the following two as- pects of the dataset, namely that (i) the photos and videos in the dataset are already randomized, and (ii) the data- set consists of 10 consecutively numbered les.
 Our dataset has been curated to be comprehensive and representative of real world photog- raphy, expansive and expandable in coverage, free and legal to use, and intends to consolidate and supplant many ex- isting collections.
 Our dataset encourages the improvement and validation of research methods, reduces the e ort of ac- quiring data, and stimulates innovation and potential new data uses.
