 Herein, we propose to compare alternative distance measures and identify the superior ones by analyzing the differences and similarities in the structural properties of resulting patent network maps.
 Boschma et al. (2013) applied the same proximity measure to studying the diversification of productive capabilities of different regions in Spain based on export product categories.
 Although the studies of product space were based on export and import data and the custom classifications of products, their proximity measure can be adapted to patent data and patent technology classifications.
 To address this gap, this paper presents a strategy and methodology to assess and compare alternative measures by investigating the similarities and differences in the structures of their resulting technology networks.
 The deviation of the number of shared inventing organizations of a pair of technology classes from the expected value under the hypothesis that diversification patterns are random.
 Country diversification likelihood : the formula is the same as the inventor diversification likelihood above (Eq. 3 and Eq. 4), except that the agent is now a country.
 In Table 3, we underline the highest correlation coefficient between each measure and any other measures, and also report the average of the correlation coefficients of one measure with all other 11 measures.
 The results of group D networks are mixed across the analyses of degree and eigenvector centralities, and the correlations of group D networks with other networks are generally weak.
 Second, the networks using country diversification likelihood (B3) and country co-occurrence frequency (C3) are the least correlated with the networks using measures in group A.
 Furthermore, inventor co-occurrence frequency (C1), organization co- occurrence frequency (C2) and normalized co-classification (D1) perform well in some of our correlation analyses, but not always. 5.
 Conclusion This paper contributes to the research to develop and analyze patent technology network maps to explore technology diversification and knowledge combination opportunities, and thus support technology forecasting and road mapping practices.
