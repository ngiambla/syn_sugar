 In computer science and related computational disciplines such as systems biology, the challenges closely revolve around the ability to implement (and exploit) novel algorithms and models.
 Taking a new approach from the literature and applying it to a new codebase frequently requires local knowledge missing from the published manuscripts and transient project websites.
 Alongside this issue, benchmarking, and the lack of open, transparent and fair benchmark sets present another barrier to the veri cation and validation of claimed results.
 A 2012 report by the UK s Royal Society stated that computational techniques have moved on from assisting scientists in doing science, to transforming both how science is done and what science is done [2].
 For example: you should provide the compiler and build toolchain; you should provide build tools (e.g.
 This system (presented in Figure 2) would integrate with publicly available source code repositories, automates the build, testing and benchmarking of algorithms and benchmarks.
 It would allow testing models against competing algorithms, and the addition of new models to the test suite (either manually or from existing online repositories).
 Such a service would then allow algorithms and models to evolve together, and be reproducible from the outset.
