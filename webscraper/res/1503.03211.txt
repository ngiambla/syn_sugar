 The procedure for forecasting SFR are rigid and most often times require data scaling or conversion into binary form such as is the case of the logistic model which may lead to lose of information and effect size attenuation.
 The outcomes of each one of the approaches using the 10 classification algorithms and 10 fold cross validation were compared in order to select the best approach to the problem.
 Their findings suggest that: (a) Prior grades and standardized achievement are the strongest predictors of high school GPA and (b) Psychosocial and behavioural (e.g., motivation, self-regulation, and social control) add incremental validity to the prediction of GPA.
 When comparing the relative importance of each set of predictors (the dominance analysis technique), the variance accounted for by psychosocial and behavioural factors is comparable to that accounted for by prior grades.
 These findings highlight the importance of effective risk assessment based on multiple measures (i.e., academic, psychosocial, and behavioural) for the purpose of identifying risk, referring students to intervention, and improving academic success [10].
 They also used a new form of genetic programming called Grammar based Genetic Programming (G3P), combined with an Interpretable Rule Classification Mining Scheme (ICRM) for the prediction of student failure rate at school using real data from high school students in Mexico.
 These data were based on class marks and of high dimensions (variable intensive) and imbalanced, thus, the need for variable (dimension) reduction, cost sensitive classification/re-sampling of original datasets these irregularities was emphasized.
 This approach uses an iterative radical unified modelling process wherein In particular we have used an open source framework for genetic programming GPTIPS [11], as a basis for the developed GP application.

 It shows that the overall population loses diversity very quickly and running the GP algorithm for more number of generations is not going to yield a much better solution.
