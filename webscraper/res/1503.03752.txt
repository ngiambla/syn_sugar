 These communication channels provide plenty of incentives (both economical and social) and opportunities for abuse.
 As social media activity became increasingly intertwined with the events in the o ine world, individuals and organizations have found ways to exploit these platforms to spread misinformation, to attack and smear others, or to deceive and manipulate.
 During crises, social media have been e ectively used for emergency response, but fear-mongering actions have also triggered mass hysteria and panic.
 Synthetic activity and social bots have been used to coordinate orchestrated astroturf campaigns, to manipulate political elections and the stock market.
 Due to a mixture of social and economical incentives, a lack of effective policies against misbehavior, and insuf cient technical solutions to timely detect and hinder improper use, social media have been recently characterized by widespread abuse.
 In the following, I illustrate what are the perils that arise from some forms of social media abuse, provide examples of the effects of such behaviors on our society, and discuss possible solutions.
 Fig. 2 shows the spreading of information need [Zhao and Mei 2013] on Twitter: the data capture all tweets produced during a short interval of 1 hour on October 17th, 2014, in the context of the discussion about the 2014 Ebola emergency.
 Particularly prominent nodes in the discussion are labeled, and they are positioned according to their centrality; different colors identify different topical communities [Ferrara et al. 2013; JafariAsbagh et al. 2014].
 His research interests lie at the intersection between Network Science, Data Science, Machine Learning, and Com- putational Social Science.
 His work explores Social Networks and Social Media Analysis, Criminal Networks, and Knowledge Engineering, and it appears on leading journals like Communications of the ACM and Physical Review Letters, several ACM and IEEE Transactions and Conference Proceedings.
