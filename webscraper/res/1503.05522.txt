 To quantitatively construct a world map of information interests, we devise a scalable statistical model that iden- ti es countries with similar information interests and measures the countries bilateral similarities.
 From the similarities we connect countries in a global network and nd that countries can be mapped into 18 clusters with similar information interests.
 Therefore we can use Wikipedia editors as sensors for mapping information interest to speci c countries.
 In this paper, we use co-editing of the same Wikipedia article as a proxy for shared information interests.
 The ltering method assumes a multinomial distribution and determines the expected number of co-occurring edits from the empirical data.
 First, we will show a global map of countries with shared information inter- ests, and continue with the interconnections between the clusters.
 Then we will consider each cluster separately and examine the in- terconnections between countries within the clusters.
 Similar results were found in other studies that analyzed Twitter and email communication worldwide (State et al., 2015).
 Overall, the analysis reveals that information exchange is con- strained by the impact of social and economic factors connected to shared interests.
 In other words, globalization of the technol- ogy does not bring globalization of the information and interests.
 Conclusions By simplifying and highlighting the important structure in the myriad edits of Wikipedia, we provide a world map of shared information interests.
