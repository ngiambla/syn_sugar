 To quantitatively construct a world map of information interests, we devise a scalable statistical model that iden- ti es countries with similar information interests and measures the countries bilateral similarities.
 From the similarities we connect countries in a global network and nd that countries can be mapped into 18 clusters with similar information interests.
 Through regression we nd that language and religion best explain the strength of the bilateral ties and formation of clusters.
 Our ndings provide a quantitative basis for further studies to better understand the complex interplay between shared interests and con ict on a global scale.
 Overall, the analysis reveals that information exchange is con- strained by the impact of social and economic factors connected to shared interests.
 In other words, globalization of the technol- ogy does not bring globalization of the information and interests.
 Language, religion, geographical proximity, historic background, and trade are potential driving factors to polarize the informa- tion interests.
 Conclusions By simplifying and highlighting the important structure in the myriad edits of Wikipedia, we provide a world map of shared information interests.
 We nd that information interests despite globalization are diverse, and that the highways and barriers of information exchange are formed by social and economic factors connected to shared interests.
 In descending order, we nd that language, religion, geographical proximity, historic background, and trade explain the diversity of interests.
