 We nd that such users tend to concentrate their efforts in a small number of threads, are more likely to post irrelevantly, and are more successful at garnering responses from other users.
 While most users tend to be civil, others may engage in antisocial behavior, negatively affecting other users and harming the community.
 Such undesired behavior, which in- cludes trolling, aming, bullying, and harassment, is exacer- bated by the fact that people tend to be less inhibited in their online interactions (Suler 2004).
 In this study, we considered users who wrote at least 10 posts, and computed the mean text quality of each user s rst ve posts.
 We divided these users into two populations: those which had four or more posts deleted among their rst ve posts, and those who had one or less posts deleted.
 Next, we matched pairs of users from these two populations on text quality, and then compare the mean text quality of their subsequent ve posts.
 Thus, we include features such as the proportion of posts that are replies and the maximum number of posts in a single thread, in addition to other features such as posts per day or votes given to other users.
 We also considered the different mechanisms in which other members of a community in- teract with users and their posts.
 Moderator features (i.e., features re- lating to post deletion) constitute the strongest signals of deletion, as community moderators are responsible for both deleting posts and banning users.
 In addition to the propor- tion of posts deleted so far, we include the slopes and in- tercepts of the deletion rate over the rst ten posts.
