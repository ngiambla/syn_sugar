 The resulting gameplay and e orts to predict its evolution are the object of great interest to both sports professionals and en- thusiasts.
 In this paper, we consider two online prediction problems for team sports: given a partially observed game Who will score next? and ultimately Who will win?
 We present novel interpretable generative models of within-game scoring that allow for dependence on lead size (restoration) and on the last team to score (anti-persistence).
 We then apply these models to comprehensive within- game scoring data for four sports leagues over a ten year period.
 We construct and test probabilistic models for two online predictive tasks: given a partially observed game Who will score next? and ultimately Who will win?
 Probability that a team scores next as a function of its lead size, for the observed (yellow ) and simulated (black ) patterns, each with a linear least squares t line.
 Probability of accurately predicting which team will score next (AUC), when models observe di erent fractions of a season.
 Based on 95% con dence intervals, our best model performs signi cantly better than the baseline models for CFB and NBA, and after observing at least half of the season for NFL and NHL. team and thus more likely to both score next and win the game.
 The second baseline is the standard Bradley-Terry model in which we infer latent team skills from the win- loss records among teams in the observed games.
 This model is simpler than our independent model, which in- fers team skills using team sequences { } of the observed games.
