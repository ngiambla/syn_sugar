 The resulting gameplay and e orts to predict its evolution are the object of great interest to both sports professionals and en- thusiasts.
 In this paper, we consider two online prediction problems for team sports: given a partially observed game Who will score next? and ultimately Who will win?
 We present novel interpretable generative models of within-game scoring that allow for dependence on lead size (restoration) and on the last team to score (anti-persistence).
 We construct and test probabilistic models for two online predictive tasks: given a partially observed game Who will score next? and ultimately Who will win?
 The events within a particular game can be e ectively modeled as the interaction of skill and chance.
 In our analysis and modeling, we discard the timestamps of the events and instead consider only the order in which events appear within a game.
 The team sequences of each game are tested independently and we plot the proportion of games that reject the null hypothesis that the sequences are random.
 For both tasks, we let our models observe the point and team sequences of the rst T games in a particular season.
 Each simula- tion uses the best overall skill model for that sport to generate synthetic point and team sequences.
 We check these models by performing a semi-parametric bootstrap, generating synthetic and sequences of the same number and lengths as observed empirically in each 8 A.
 Probability of accurately predicting which team will score next (AUC), when models observe di erent fractions of a season.
