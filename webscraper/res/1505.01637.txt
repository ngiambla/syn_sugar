 A total of 3,645 (9%) services were posted by key users, while the remaining 35,875 (91%) services were posted by non-key users.
 Below we characterize different aspects of the services offered by key users and non- key users.
 Figures 2(b) and 2(c) show the distributions of service volume and revenue for key and non-key users.
 It is noteworthy that a vast majority of services by key users (1,874 = 51%) and non-key users (26,547 = 74%) have no sales and thus zero revenue.
 Figure 2(d) plots the distribution of view count for services offered by key users and non-key users.
 We note that the services offered by key users are generally viewed more than those by non-key users.
 We note that a majority of key users (88%) are buyers and they purchased services more than non-key users.
 Specif- ically, 99 key users (out of a total of 262K users) account for more than 56% of the total revenue.
 We compare and contrast key and non-key users by analyzing the services they offer, and their selling and buying behavior.
 We nd that a majority of key users on SEOClerks are located in Asian countries, and that some of them purchase services from other sellers and then sell them at higher prices.
