 We label a total of 99 sellers who satisfy the aforementioned three criteria as key users.
 Figures 2(b) and 2(c) show the distributions of service volume and revenue for key and non-key users.
 Figure 2(d) plots the distribution of view count for services offered by key users and non-key users.
 We note that services with more views tend to have higher sales volume for both key and non-key users.
 Tables II and the top categories of services and the top selling service for each category for key users and non-key users, respectively.
 Figure 4(a) plots the distribution of the number of services listed by key and non-key users on SEOClerks.
 Figure 5(a) plots the distributions of the purchase volume by key and non-key users.
 Figures 7(a) and 7(b) visualize the purchases made by key users from key and non-key users, respectively.
 For example, a key user offers a service providing Instagram followers, and the same user has repeatedly purchased services offering Instagram followers from other sellers.
