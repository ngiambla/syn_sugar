 We nd that natural disasters, climate bills, and oil-drilling can contribute to a decrease in happiness while climate rallies, a book release, and a green ideas contest can contribute to an increase in happiness.
 The word shift graph in Fig. 3 shows which words con- tributed most to the shift in happiness between climate tweets and un ltered tweets.
 Words such as pollution , de- nial , tax , and war are all negative, and are used relatively more frequently in climate tweets, contribut- ing to the drop in happiness.
 The words disaster and hurricane are used more frequently in climate tweets, suggesting that the subject of climate change co-occurs with mention of natural disasters, and strong evidence exists proving Twitter is a valid indicator of real time attention to natural disasters [26].
 They found that tweets containing the word climate were, on average, similar in ambient happiness to those con- taining the words no , rain , oil , and cold (see Table 2 [19]).
 There is more profanity within these tweets and there are also more words suggesting that climate change deniers use the term global warming more of- ten than climate change .
 For example, there is more usage of the words stop , blame , freezing , fraud , and politicians in tweets containing global warming .
 These tweets also show less frequent usage of positive words science and energy , indicating that climate change science is discussed more within tweets contain- ing climate .
 We also see a decrease in words such as crisis , bill , risk , denial , denying , disaster , and threat .
 A study using climate change and global warming tweets showed that both weather and mass media coverage heavily in- uence belief in anthropogenic climate change [43].
