 INTRODUCTION The initial medical response to Ebola in 2014 focused on caring for individuals in hospital settings and using contact tracing as the primary preventative measure [1].
 We incorporate such events into a transmission model and test that the results are robust to variations in the model transmission network.
 In our simulations, we allowed the disease to spread unabated for the rst T0 days, after which the intervention policies are put into place.
 We consider two di erent sets of parameter values corresponding to two di erent estimates of R0 for the 2014 Ebola outbreak in Liberia.
 We found that a relatively low compliance of 0.4 with the community screening policies was enough to end the outbreak (Fig. 1A).
 Even with a compliance of 0.4, enough infections were halted to reduce the value of Rt below 1 (Fig. 1C).
 Without travel restrictions, compliance levels between 20% and 40% actually prolong the outbreak relative to the no intervention case (Fig. 3A).
 This shows that, in the event of low compliance, travel restrictions limit the spread and duration of the outbreak.
 The infected area shrinks and the ratio of type A (red) to type B (green) neighborhoods decreases over time.
 Neglecting corrections of O(1/G2), the infected individual chooses 23 one such individual to visit and infects that individual according to the probability .
 It is common to characterize simulated and real-world outbreaks using R0, the average number of secondary infectious caused by a single infectious individual in an otherwise susceptible population.
 Results for = 10, = 7 We simulated our epidemic with the parameters values = 10, = 7, = 0.18, and = 0.015.
