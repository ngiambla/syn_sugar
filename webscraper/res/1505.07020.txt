 We consider two di erent sets of parameter values corresponding to two di erent estimates of R0 for the 2014 Ebola outbreak in Liberia.
 These are consistent with empirical bounds on the parameters [55] and the results are robust to variation in these values as shown below.
 First, we considered a latency period of = 5 days and an infectious period of = 6 days to re ect the modeling assumptions of Althaus [51].
 Using these time periods and infection parameters of = 0.15 and = 0.0125, we conducted 1,000 simulations and obtained an average exponential growth rate of 0.054, which results in an R0 estimate of 1.7, comparable to the value 1.6 obtained by Althaus.
 Second, we used the parameter values = 10 and = 7 to compare our model with that of Chowell and Nishiura, who estimated that R0 = 1.96 [49].
 RESULTS Fig. 1 shows the number of current and cumulative cases for various levels of compli- ance with community level interventions implemented at T0 = 70 days and without travel restrictions.
 Fig. 1B shows that there is relatively little di erence in the cumulative number of infections over the duration of the outbreak for the interventions with 0.6, 0.8, and 1.0 compliance.
 Thus, and perhaps surprisingly, the greatest gains in reducing the epidemic duration and cumulative number of cases arise from a particularly low level of compliance.
 The travel restrictions compensate for low levels of compliance, and their di erences are comparable to Fig. 3 in the main paper.
 The cumulative number of infections over the entire epidemic, as a function of compliance levels and intervention times.
