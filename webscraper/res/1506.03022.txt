 Using syn- thetic and real-world networks, we study how network structure and con guration of active nodes contributes to the paradox.
 This quantity also a ects the probability that a randomly chosen edge is connected to a node of degree k, otherwise known as neighbor degree distribution q(k).
 The con guration of attributes in a network is speci ed by the joint probability distribution P (x, k), the probability that node of degree k has an attribute x.
 In this work, we consider binary attributes only, and refer to nodes with x = 1 as active and those with x = 0 as inactive.
 Such networks are used to model the heterogeneous structure of many real-world networks, which contain a few high degree hubs and many low degree nodes.
 We activated P (x = 1) = 0.05 of nodes and used edge rewiring and attribute swapping procedures describe above to change the network s degree assortativity r and degree attribute correlation kx.
 Magnitude of the majority illusion in real-world networks as a function of degree attribute correlation kx for di erent fraction of active nodes P (x = 1).
 Here P (x = 1|k) is the conditional probability of having an active neighbor, given a node with degree k, and is speci ed by Eq. 2.
 Using Equation 4, we can calculate the strength of the majority illusion paradox for any network whose degree sequence, joint degree distribution e(k, k ), and conditional attribute distribution P (x|k) are known.
 We quanti ed this paradox, which we call the majority illusion , and studied its dependence on network structure and attribute con gura- tion.
 Speci cally, we showed that the paradox is much stronger in dis- assortative networks, where high degree nodes tend to link to low degree nodes.
 For convenience, we will re- fer to nodes with the attribute value x = 1 as active, and those with x = 0 as inactive.
