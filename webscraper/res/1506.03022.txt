 Using syn- thetic and real-world networks, we study how network structure and con guration of active nodes contributes to the paradox.
 We demon- strate empirically, as well as through theoreti- cal analysis, that the paradox is stronger in net- works in which the better-connected nodes are active, and also in networks with a heteroge- neous degree distribution.
 The con guration of attributes in a network is speci ed by the joint probability distribution P (x, k), the probability that node of degree k has an attribute x.
 In this work, we consider binary attributes only, and refer to nodes with x = 1 as active and those with x = 0 as inactive.
 The joint distribution can be used to compute kx, the correlation between node degrees and attributes: kx = = 1 x k Xx,k x k Xk 1 xk [P (x, k) P (x)p(k)] (1) k [P (x = 1, k) P (x = 1)p(k)] P (x = 1) x k [hkix=1 hki] .
 We activated P (x = 1) = 0.05 of nodes and used edge rewiring and attribute swapping procedures describe above to change the network s degree assortativity r and degree attribute correlation kx.
 Figure 2 shows the fraction of nodes with a majority active neighbors in these scale-free net- works as a function of the degree attribute cor- relation kx and for di erent values of degree as- sortativity r.
 For = 2.1, 60% 80% of the nodes may observe a majority active neighbors, even though only 5% of the nodes are, in fact, active.
 Magnitude of the majority illusion in Erd os-R enyi-type networks as a function of degree attribute correlation kx and for di erent values of degree assortativity r.
 Each network has 10,000 nodes with hki = 5.2 (top row) or hki = 2.5 (bottom row), and di erent fractions of active nodes.
