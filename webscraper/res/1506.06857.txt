 We nd that promotions that are full-price discounted and digital (i.e., the redemption procedure is a few taps on the smartphone) are the ones that cause the largest increase in downloads.
 Investigating the e ect on ratings, we nd neutral or positive e ects on the ratings for all full- price discounted promotions but negative short-term e ects on the ratings of apps promoted by substantial, but only partial, price discounts.
 Similarly, creators of apps try to induce word of mouth and publicity for their apps, for example, via free light versions of their (not-free) app or by lowering the app s price for a limited time.
 This is 7 our second and main control dataset which we use to control for temporal and other trends when examining the e ect of the promotions on the sales and ratings of the promoted (and competing to the promoted) apps.
 Terminology Throughout the paper we will refer to any apps that were o ered as part of the digital version of the Starbucks iOS Pick of the week promotion as Starbucks Digital apps and to the promotion itself as Starbucks Digital.
 Similarly, we will use the terms Starbucks In-Store apps and Starbucks In-Store promotion, Apple Weekly apps and Apple Weekly promotion and Apple Amazing apps and Apple Amazing promotion.
 This hints that the developers of the Apple Weekly apps prepare for a large in ux of new users who will get the app for free and use in-app purchases to capitalize on them.
 In contrast, the two Starbucks and the Apple Amazing promotions have a smaller e ect on the revenue of their developers since users that don t have redemption codes still pay full price for the app.
 The ratings for apps featured in the Starbucks In- Store promotion increased by 0.14 star (from 4.33 to 4.47) and for apps featured in the Apple Amazing promotion decreased by 0.34 star (from 4.3 to 3.96).
 Popularity before the start of the promotion will help us see if there are any rich-get-richer e ects, where apps that were already popular bene t disproportionally from price reductions and promotions.
