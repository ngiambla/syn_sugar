 IV; (2) Present caloric maps of the contiguous US contrasting the 48 states and DC through histograms and phrase shifts (Sec.
 The histograms in Figs. 5, S2, and S3 show the speci c rankings according to these two variables and also Crat (see Fig. 3).
 The overlaid phrase lemmas are the most dominant contributors to Cin and Cout almost universally pizza and watching tv or movie .
 For example, tweets from Vermont, which was above average for both Cin and Cout for 2011 2012, disproportionately contain bacon and skiing .
 Michigan was above average for Cin and below for Cout in 2011 2012, and the most distinguishing phrases are chocolate candy and laying down .
 Tweet-based caloric out- put drops to a low in Mississippi and the surrounding 6 states, while Michigan also appears to have a low value of Cout.
 For the food and activities maps in Fig. 1, we also show the most dominant phrase for each population s Cin and Cout scores.
 Here, we will explain and use analogously con- structed phrase shifts for both Cin and Cout to examine the states at the extremes of our Crat rankings, Col- orado and Mississippi.
 We provide interactive phrase shifts as part of the paper s Online Appendices at http://compstorylab.org/share/papers/alajajian2015a/ and at http: //panometer.org/instruments/lexicocalorimeter.
 We explain phrase (word) shifts in the main text (see Eqs. 5 and 6), and in full depth in [2] and [16] and online at http://hedonometer.org [23]. 10 often.
