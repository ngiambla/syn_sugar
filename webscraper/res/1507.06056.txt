 The lectures were meant to provide exposure to the eld of graph and geometric algorithms and to motivate the participants towards research.
 Fifty-eight professors from TIFR, IITs, IISc, IMSc, CMI, ISI Kolkata, and other institutes and universities delivered invited lectures on different topics in the design and analysis of algorithms, discrete ap- plied mathematics, computer graphics, computer vision, and robotics.
 This course used to cover asymptotic analysis of running time and space requirements for quantita- tively measuring the ef ciency of algorithms, searching and sorting algorithms, data structures, sequential algorithms for graph and geometric problems, NP-completeness, etc.
 Many of these theses for designing ef cient algorithms used mathematical 2 techniques from combinatorics, probability theory, graph theory, etc., and algorithmic tech- niques like greedy methods, divide and conquer, approximations, randomization, etc.
 Naturally, several softwares were designed in 80 s and 90 s and many of them used basic algorithmic techniques and data structures that were routinely taught in the courses of Design and Analysis of Algorithms not only in IITs, IISc and TIFR but also in NITs, BITS Pilani, and several universities in India.
 New types of algorithms like streaming algorithms, web- based algorithms, network algorithms, distributed algorithms, big data algorithms, etc. came into play in the last two decades.
 Though the number of researchers working in India on graph and geometric algorithms has increased substantially in the last two decades, the number of active researchers in algorithms is still far lesser in India compared to the large number of bright students and teachers involved in studying and teaching computer science and discrete applied mathematics.
 In order to moti- vate them towards computer science research in general and algorithmic research in particular, twenty-two workshops of introductory lectures on graph and geometric algorithms were orga- nized during 2008-2015 for teachers and students (undergraduate, post-graduate, and doctoral) of engineering colleges and universities at different locations in India.
 Our workshop series may be viewed as a human resource development program for raising the level of algorithmic knowledge amongst Indian college and university students and teachers in computer science and discrete applied mathematics. 2 Workshop data 2.1 Organizational details During 2008-2015, twenty-two workshops of introductory lectures on graph and geometric algorithms were organized at different states and union territories of India as shown in Tables I(a) and II(b), and in Figure 1. 3 Table I(a): Dates, Workshop Venues and Coordinators No Date 1 Workshop Venue Fr.
 Moreover, the bene- ts from the exposure to the broad eld of graph and geometric algorithms will certainly get re ected in the future profession of many of the participants.
