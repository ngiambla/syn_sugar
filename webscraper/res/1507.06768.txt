 A set of 41,000 mobile ideas obtained from a research project in 2006 granted us a unique opportunity to study the mobile service ideas from young children.
 We randomly selected two samples of ideas (N=400 each), one contained the ideas from young children, the other from adults (aged 17-50).
 The results show that the mobile service ideas from the young children are significantly more original, transformational, implementable, and relevant than those from the adults.
 It also indicates a new and valuable source for the companies that seek for creative ideas for innovative products and services.

 Regarding the two constructs of idea quality, our results support H2a and found significant evidence that the mobile service ideas expressed by children are implemented more frequently, i.e., they are more workable.
 In the study of Alahuhta, Abrahamsson, & Nummiaho (2008) it was claimed that 23 95% of adults ideas could be implemented.
 Our study found instead that the percentage of implemented adults ideas was 69%, which is 26% lower than predicted.
 We also found significant support to H2b, which shows that children s ideas are more relevant than those of adults.
 We compared the percentages of our analysis of the children s ideas to that of the adults ideas presented in (Alahuhta et al., 2008).
