 Therefore, this work helps to address this gap by proposing and testing view counter auditing tools and methodologies for online video portals. 3.
 From this, we conclude that the view audit systems of YouTube and Dai- lymotion are fairly effective at identifying views generated by real users.
 Finally, it is worth noting that the data provided by YouTube and Dailymotion in both experiments shows a spatially localized distribution of viewer visits.
 For the following set of experiments, we study the performance of audit system for monetized views of YouTube and Dailymotion.
 We consider a view from the probe as monetized, iff a video ad is served to it, and the probe views the whole ad and the video.
 Figure 2: Comparison of false negative ratio for the number of views in the public and monetized view counters for YouTube and Dailymotion.
 We rst look at the impact of view patterns to a single video, then explore the cases for a single IP viewing multiple videos, and nally a single video receiving views from multiple IP addresses.
 One video, One IP address We start by examining how YouTube discounts the views generated by a single IP address to a single video.
 In particular, we are interested in understanding how the view penalization threshold(s) are triggered, when varying the number of views per day.
 We conduct a simple experiment, in which the probe generates W = [1, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60] views per day, to a given video, for 8 days.
