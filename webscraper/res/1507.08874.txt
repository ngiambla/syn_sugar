 Myvideo.de, TV UOL and Vimeo deploy view audit systems that detect < 5% of the probe s fake views, even for the most aggressive con guration.
 From this, we conclude that the view audit systems of YouTube and Dai- lymotion are fairly effective at identifying views generated by real users.
 Figure 2: Comparison of false negative ratio for the number of views in the public and monetized view counters for YouTube and Dailymotion.
 In summary, we nd that among the online video portals studied, only YouTube deploys a suf ciently discriminative video view au- diting system.
 We observe that the audit system counts as valid 7% and 6% of views for the D and SV con gurations respectively .
 In particular, we are interested in understanding how the view penalization threshold(s) are triggered, when varying the number of views per day.
 Figure 5 gives the number of views the audit system counts over time, for the conservative probes in the two IP addresses.
 We observe that view penalization starts 24 hours after the launch of the aggressive probe in IP-2, and ends two days after the probe stops.
 We assign each group of proxies a different video on YouTube, and con gure each proxy to generate views to its corresponding video.
 We again utilize the Deterministic behavior of the probe, and report the results with each PlanetLab proxy group to generate 3 views per day.
