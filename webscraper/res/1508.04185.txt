 The four most prominent Fashion Weeks worldwide take place twice a year and, as of 2015, are hosted in the cities of New York, London, Paris, and Milan.
 These events facilitate net- working and information sharing, and are seen as a crucial part of the process by which the fashion industry collectively decides what will be the new trends and the next top models.
 To account only for a homogeneous set of runway expe- riences, we considered only runways occurred during the fashion weeks for the 2015 S / S season in New York, Lon- don, Paris, and Milan.
 These occurred during the period of September 2014 and were the most recent major fashion weeks at the time of our data collection (December 2014).
 The last experiment of this paper, however, represents a real prediction task in which we train the machine learning models with the previous fashion season (2015 S / S) data, and use them to predict the upcoming 2015-16 Fall / Winter (F / W) season.
 This is consistent with previous research [19], and highlights the role of agencies in setting fashion models trends in the fashion industry.
 We then focus on models with an Instagram account (Ni = 253) and assess how the average number of posted media, received likes, and comments is associated to the count of walked runways.
 Increasingly, the usage of social data, often in conjunction with other data sources, proves crucial to be able to represent real-world events, trends, information dif- fusion, and social behavior.
 In this study we were concerned with understanding whether it is possible to predict fashion models popularity, complementing physical and professional information with social data.
 Our methodology has of course limitations, and we here re- port few notable ones: Figure 4: Confusion matrix of the Random Forest perfor- mance for the prediction task (2015-16 F / W Fashion Week).
