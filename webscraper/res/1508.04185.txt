 The four most prominent Fashion Weeks worldwide take place twice a year and, as of 2015, are hosted in the cities of New York, London, Paris, and Milan.
 We give a brief overview of the work related to predicting success in cultural markets, and fashion in particular, in the next section.
 We start with a descriptive analysis of the FMD data, and estimate the degree of association between the tenure of a model and a number of standard industry metrics using a re- gression framework.
 RELATED WORK In this study we are looking at predicting popularity of fash- ion models using data from social media activity.
 The study of trends in cultural markets has a long-standing tradition [5], and various researchers have exploited social data from a wide range of backgrounds.
 The chances of walking for models without a prestigious agency drop sub- stantially, as the expected count for the baseline is now only 0.28 walks.
 This is consistent with previous research [19], and highlights the role of agencies in setting fashion models trends in the fashion industry.
 The sentiment itself appears to be positively associated to better chances of walking a runway (23% more), together with the overall number of comments.
 For the latter statistical model, we restrict the training data to use only the media posted in the three months before the fashion week.
 In this study we were concerned with understanding whether it is possible to predict fashion models popularity, complementing physical and professional information with social data.
 While beyond the scope of the present work, an intriguing question that follows up from it is whether Instagram and other social media are in- deed changing the traditional notions of beauty.
