 We study Twitter conversations about diabetes through the systematic analysis of 2.5 million tweets collected over 8 months and the inter- actions between their authors.
 We address three questions: (1) what themes arise in these tweets?; (2) who are the most in uential users?; (3) which type of users contribute to which themes?
 The con uence of health promotion and commercial agents on Twitter has led to a cacophony of short health-related messages directed at users and passed through social networks.
 There is little critical analysis of the wider landscape of, and relationships underpinning, health-related content on Twitter, or of the impact that messages have in the broad user base.
 In the example network from Fig. 3A, node 1 has retweeted statuses of nodes 3, 4 and 7, and has had nodes 2, 6 and 8 retweet some of her own (i.e. the in-and out-degree of node 1 are both three).
 For example, a topic about Diabetes Blog Week in May 2013 gathered 6 of the top ten authorities: @di- abetesalish, @diabetesblogs, @DiabetesSocMed, @Dia- betes Sano , @diabetesfacts, and @EverydayHealth.
 In other weeks, the top 10 authorities appear together in topics related to promotion of blogs by diabetics (using the hashtag #dblogs, which appears in 15,901 tweets in the data set), and diabetes social media awareness (using the hashtag #dsma, which is promoted by @Diabetes- SocMed and appears in 10,945 tweets). b.
 In this network, each of the top 1000 authorities is a node and a directed connection be- tween two nodes indicates that the source node follows the target node on Twitter.
 This poses challenges to the use of Twitter as a health promo- tion platform, and requires the use of sophisticated tech- niques (e.g., collaboration of health professionals with practitioners of network and data science).
 Further re- search and engagement with real people, and not sim- ply their virtual online personae which represent them, is necessary to elucidate the expertise and intentions of users generating some of the key diabetes-related content on Twitter.
