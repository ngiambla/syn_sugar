 We analyze these multilingual editors in terms of their engagement, interests, and language proficiency in their primary and non-primary (secondary) languages and find that the English edition of Wikipedia displays different dynamics from the Spanish and German editions.
 We also examine the topical interests of multilingual editors and find that there is no significant difference between primary and non-primary editors in each language.
 We discard editors who edited more than 10 languages (these editors account for 2.3% of all multilingual editors). (b) Primary languages of multilingual editors for the three largest language editions.
 Distribution of editors and article edit sessions for the three language editions English (en), German (de), and Spanish (es) for primary (P) and non-primary (NP) multilingual editors.
 Pre-Edit We first examine the complexity of Pre-Edits to understand the text which multilingual editors choose to edit in their primary and non-primary languages.
 Fig. 7a shows that the entropy of unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams is always higher for the edits of multilingual users writing in English or Spanish as a primary language compared to those writing in English or Spanish as a non- primary language.
 In short, we observe a difference between primary and non-primary editors for all conditions, indicating that primary editors use more diverse terms while editing.
 Moreover, we observe that the entropy of part-of-speech unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams is significantly higher for edits by primary editors in English and Spanish.
 Specifically, for the German and Spanish editions, we find the average increase in entropy between article edit sessions is higher from primary than non-primary editors.
 Surprisingly, however, we do not observe a significant difference between editors writing in English as a primary or non- primary language for the lexical diversity and syntactic complexity.
