 We analyze these multilingual editors in terms of their engagement, interests, and language proficiency in their primary and non-primary (secondary) languages and find that the English edition of Wikipedia displays different dynamics from the Spanish and German editions.
 We discard editors who edited more than 10 languages (these editors account for 2.3% of all multilingual editors). (b) Primary languages of multilingual editors for the three largest language editions.
 In all three language editions there are more primary editors (p) than non-primary editors (np) and primary editors are more active than non-primary editors.
 In the German edition, primary editors show more interest in Computer and Natural Science, while non-primary editors show more interest in Soccer and Global Sports.
 Pre-Edit We first examine the complexity of Pre-Edits to understand the text which multilingual editors choose to edit in their primary and non-primary languages.
 In short, we observe a difference between primary and non-primary editors for all conditions, indicating that primary editors use more diverse terms while editing.
 Specifically, for the German and Spanish editions, we find the average increase in entropy between article edit sessions is higher from primary than non-primary editors.
 The results of analyzing engagement shows that multilinguals add more content and spend significantly more time per article edit session in their primary languages.
 We also find that the overall distribution of interests is very similar between primary and non-primary users in each language although there are a few differences by topic and language.
 The English edition of Wikipedia shows similar findings for the types of articles primary and non-primary users choose to edit (pre-edit) and for the use of articles (diff).
