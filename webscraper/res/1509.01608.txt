 The study investigates the network structure of a Ma a organization, de- scribing its evolution and highlighting its plasticity to interventions targeting membership and its resilience to disruption caused by police operations.
 The network Ncon contained 1, 716 vertices and 8,481 edges. 1See http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4899512.stm 2 By means of further investigation, we were able to identify crime relationships: we say that a crime relationship exists between two individuals if they took part in the same criminal o ense or if they have been seen together during a sighting.
 The network Ncri contained only 104 vertices and 2,596 edges: all but 6 individuals in the criminal network were also present in the contact network.
 In case of sequential police operations, the CC has the most disruptive e ect on SCC and this happens both in Ncon and in Ncri.
 On the other hand, the source of available data is often unknown and, therefore, it is hard to determine if the information is credible and accurate.
 In this work, the edges Econ are considered as undirected and unweighted, thus disregarding the orientation and the number of contacts between two any vertices.
 Finally, Figure 2(c) shows the subgraph Naggr which comprises of all the criminal and telephone-based connections of Ncri where we highlighted the vertices of the subset Icri.
 Similarly to many other socio-technical systems, contacts among individuals in Ncon are rather sparse and unevenly distributed, with few vertices capturing most of the edges in Ncon.
 In contrast, due to its high density of crime ties, Ncri is much more resilient and therefore it is able to e ectively react to targeted attacks. 6.
 Resilience of criminal and contact networks in a sequential police operation We conclude our study by focusing on a di erent type of police operation that we call se- quential scenario.
 We observe that CC has the most disruptive e ect on the reduction of SCC and this happens both in Ncon and in Ncri.
