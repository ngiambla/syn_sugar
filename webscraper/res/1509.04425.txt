 Following a brief review of the policy and research context related to this question, this paper describes the design, features and potential applications of such a tool.
 The Propensity to Cycle Tool (PCT) is an online, interactive planning support system which was initially developed to explore and map cycling potential across England (see www.pct.bike).
 Based 1 on origin-destination data, it models and visualises cycling levels at area, desire line, route and route network levels, for current levels of cycling, and for scenario-based cycling futures .
 Four scenarios are presented, including Go Dutch and Ebikes , which explore what would happen if English people cycled as much as Dutch people and the potential impact of electric cycles on cycling uptake.
 The cost e ectiveness of investment depends not only on the number of additional trips cycled, but on wider impacts such as health and carbon bene ts.
 Han and Hayashi, 2008; Shergold et al., 2012), and the bene ts of cycling (De Nazelle et al., 2011; Oja et al., 2011; Tainio et al., 2016).
 In this context there is growing interest, and in some cases substantial investment, in cycling infrastructure, including in countries with historically low rates of cycling.
 While the Government Target and Gender equality scenarios model relatively modest increases in cycle commuting, Go Dutch represents what would happen if English people were as likely as Dutch people to cycle a trip of a given distance and level of hilliness.
 This scenario thereby captures the proportion of commuters that would be expected to cycle if all areas of England had the same infrastructure and cycling culture as the Netherlands (but retained their hilliness and commute distance patterns).
 This scenario was generated by taking baseline propensity to cycle (see previous section), and applying Dutch scaling factors parameters which increase the proportion of trips cycled above the baseline level of cycling per OD pair.
