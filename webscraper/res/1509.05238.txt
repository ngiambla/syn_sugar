 Examples of health and tness wearable devices and applications include health monitors, tness trackers, activity monitors, and analysis aids.
 According to Orange [2014], tness and medical wearables accounted for 60% of the wearables market in 2013 and it is predicted that the health wearables market will be worth roughly 3.7 billion by 2019.
 The lack of ef cient data collection, utilisation and feedback may all contribute to the causes of this issue.
 Advanced sensors can log individu- als health data ef ciently and can present the users with comprehensive information about their health.
 In this paper, we present an extensive survey of different approaches for data utilisation from wearable and mobile technology with regards to tness and health behaviour change.
 We explore examples and studies of wearable sensors, actuators, and applications used to promote health and wellness.
 For behaviour change theories and techniques, we mainly focused on the work of the UCL Behaviour change group by Michie et al. [2014, 2013].
 This survey is organised as follows; in Section 2, we focus on using data to encourage behaviour change through motivation and persuasive techniques, using gaming and social aspects to achieve this.
 This raised awareness on problematic behaviour and the focus on consequences can be an initial trigger to start a behaviour change.
 Prochaska and DiClemente s Transtheoretical Model [1982] describes stages of behaviour change and that different techniques can support people to change in different changes.
