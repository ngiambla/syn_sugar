 The lack of ef cient data collection, utilisation and feedback may all contribute to the causes of this issue.
 WEARABLE DATA REPRESENTATION In current wearable applications, visual representations and methods of feedback are the most common way to communicate data to the user [Ludden 2013].
 Adaptive and Contextual Data Adaptive and personal data representations can be a powerful tool to deliver meaningful infor- mation from wearable devices.
 While a high level of arousal promotes the execution of habits and stereotypic behaviour, low levels of arousal weaken self-control.
 Adjusting data representations around an individual s attitudes and personal traits can lead to stronger intentions for behavioural change. 3.4.
 The right presentation of this data to the user can have an impact on the in uence on behaviour change.
 This raised awareness on problematic behaviour and the focus on consequences can be an initial trigger to start a behaviour change.
 Action: People in this stage have begun to change their behaviour and make efforts to keep this going.
 As a response to this, it has been suggested that data and data representations should act as a facilitator for behaviour change.
 A system that can adapt to the user and recognise their needs could help to form a long-term relationship be- tween a user and their health data.
