 These trees can be used to com- pose and test sophisticated hypotheses and to develop predictive models.
 Availability and Implementation: Branch is hosted at http://biobranch.org/ and the open source code is available at http://bitbucket.org/sulab/biobranch/.
 This tool not only allows users to answer questions of particular datasets, Users begin by selecting a dataset of interest from the Branch dataset li- brary.
 A decision tree built using a node-negative, ER-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer dataset(Griffith et al., 2013). (A) Evaluation of the tree on the testing set.
 In addition, the appli- cation can be used to generate a crowdsourced collection of predictive models that captures the collective knowledge of the user community.
 This library of predictive models should prove useful to individual users and might also be applied computationally, for example, to generate an ensemble predictor.
