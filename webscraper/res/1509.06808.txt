 Contact: {gkarthik, asu, bgood}@scripps.edu 1 Introduction One central goal of large-scale molecular profiling is to identify con- sistent patterns that can be used to advance understanding of and to make predictions about a particular condition.
 Given the large numbers of fea- it can also be used to interactively construct and test a complex predic- tive model.
 Yet, despite the troves of data collected, the predictive and explanatory power of patterns extracted automatically from data remain weak for most conditions of in- terest(Weigelt et al., 2012).
 It also provides a collaborative graphical interface for manual creation of decision trees that encapsulate the structure of sophisticated hypotheses.
 This tool not only allows users to answer questions of particular datasets, Users begin by selecting a dataset of interest from the Branch dataset li- brary.
 Each dataset corresponds to a single table in which each row con- tains the values for a set of features, e.g. gene expression levels or clini- cal variables, and a binary class label for each sample, e.g. cancer/nor- mal.
 Third, if no compatible datasets are available as independent test sets, the percentage split option simulates the pro- cess by dividing the data randomly into a training and testing set again Gangavarapu et al.
 A decision tree built using a node-negative, ER-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer dataset(Griffith et al., 2013). (A) Evaluation of the tree on the testing set.
 In addition, the appli- cation can be used to generate a crowdsourced collection of predictive models that captures the collective knowledge of the user community.
 This library of predictive models should prove useful to individual users and might also be applied computationally, for example, to generate an ensemble predictor.
