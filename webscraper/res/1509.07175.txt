 To do this, we measure text-to-text and text-to- past surprise using the publication order of the texts that Darwin read.
 Bayesian epoch estimation (BEE) models an epoch as a Gaussian dis- tribution of relative surprise, in either the text-to-text or text-to-past case, with xed mean and variance.
 The null, actual, and greedy shortest-path results show that Darwin has a focused reading strategy despite not following a pattern of pure surprise- minimization.
 Text-to-past KL is lower, as Darwin s read- ing spreads out to cover the topic space and lowers the information-theoretic surprise of subsequent books.
 Darwin s reading strategy is simultaneously more exploitative than would be expected of a random reader while also not following a strategy of pure surprise- minimization.
 Darwin s surprise accumulates at di erent rates depending on time, as can be seen in Fig. 1 for the text-to-text case (top panel) and the text-to-past case (bottom panel).
 Tracking the slopes in these charts over time, however, allows us to see how Darwin moves between low- surprise and high-surprise choices on a range of timescales.
 The interaction of these decision rules at the text-to-text and text-to-past levels characterize Darwin s behavior. 3.3.
 The third epoch shows local and global exploration (higher surprise in both cases). 13 Figure 2: Darwin s reading order more exploratory than the culture s produc- tion.
 The text-to-text case makes the most severe assumption of all: that Darwin s reading choices are condi- tional solely on the book just read.
