 Simone Bohn [7] reviewed the literature and concluded that party system fragmentation impacts the electoral dynamic, the process of coalition formation, governing, and ultimately, the survival of political systems in presidential democracies.
 Another crucial factor for governance is party discipline, i.e., the ability of a political party to get its members to support the policies of their party leadership.
 Thus, I conclude that merging parties signi cantly raises the chances of reducing the number of parties in Brazil by moving partisans from one party to another without decreasing party discipline.
 However, this has to be done cautiously, since there are two partially con icting goals: (1) Minimize the number of parties; (2) Maximize party and partisan discipline.
 These goals are con icting because minimizing the number of eligible parties to receive partisans as members implies reducing the options for moving partisans and, as a consequence, the number of good options.
 For each partisan a A, the model randomly pick an option [oa := (a, p, sim)] Oa and assigns a to party p.
 By using the options set Oa I guarantee that the party p allocated to a has voted for every proposition voted by a, i.e., Ba Bp. (3) random- .
 Finally, when only Q3 is 1 (Q3), ARRANGE could provide a 86% reduction in the number of parties by generating a con guration (e.g. c0.41) with only 5 parties.
 It is worth mentioning that the number of parties in Brazil is so excessive that even random-sq was able to generate a con guration with fewer parties than the status quo.
 Concerning discipline, I show in Fig. 7 the overall discipline (Fig. 7a) and the average party (Fig. 7b) and partisan (Fig. 7c) disciplines of the con gurations produced by ARRANGE and its competitors.
