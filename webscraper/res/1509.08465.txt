 Conceptually, the effective number of parties is simply the number of viable or important political parties in a party system that includes parties of unequal sizes.
 The more fragmented the party system is, the less likely it is that the president s party will control a majority of seats in the legislature.
 In the same way, for each proposition b Ba given party p, there is a vote vb of a given partisan a, there is a vote vb a associated with it.
 The rst two principal components of the PCA run for partisans votes in the USA and in Brazil. parties receiving partisans and preserving party discipline.
 More formally, given a partisan a := (u, pi), his/her current party pi, and his/her set of propositions Ba, an option oa := (a, pj, sim(a, pj)) is a tuple composed by the partisan a, a party pj 6= pi, and the similarity value sim(a, pj) between a and pj.
 The set Oa = {o1 a, ...} is composed by all the options of partisan a or, more formally a, o2 Oa = {[oa := (a := (u, pi), pj, sim(a, pj))] : (6) Moreover, an option oa := (a, pj, sim(a, pj)) of partisan a := (u, pi) is characterized as a good option if sim(a, pj) sim(a, pi).
 However, this has to be done cautiously, since there are two partially con icting goals: (1) Minimize the number of parties; (2) Maximize party and partisan discipline.
 For each partisan a A, the model randomly pick an option [oa := (a, p, sim)] Oa and assigns a to party p.
 Concerning discipline, I show in Fig. 7 the overall discipline (Fig. 7a) and the average party (Fig. 7b) and partisan (Fig. 7c) disciplines of the con gurations produced by ARRANGE and its competitors.
