 Our goal is to determine the potential of Instagram for public health monitoring and surveillance for DDI, ADR, and behavioral pathology at large.
 Using drug, symptom, and natural product dictionaries for identi cation of the various types of DDI and ADR evidence, we have collected close to 7000 user timelines spanning from October 2010 to June 2015.
 This demonstrates that Instagram contains much drug- and pathology speci c data for public health monitoring of DDI and ADR, and that complex network analysis provides an important toolbox to extract health-related associations and their support from large-scale social media data.
 This allows the potential extraction of ADR and DDI that manifest at di erent time scales.
 From this data, we demonstrate that Instagram user timelines contain substantial data of interest to characterize DDI, ADR, and natural product use.
 To explore this data we have developed a monitoring tool to easily observe user-level timelines associated with drug and symptom terms of interest, which we describe below.
 These numbers are 148/99 and 74/46 for symptoms and NP, respectively, for a total of 636 terms.

 Discussion and Future Directions Our preliminary analysis demonstrates that there exists a substantial health-related user com- munity in Instagram who posts about their health conditions and medications.
 Thus, Instagram data shows great potential for public health monitoring and surveillance for DDI and ADR.
 Our preliminary analysis demonstrates that Instagram is a very powerful source of data of potential bene t to monitor and uncover DDI and ADR.
