 Our goal is to determine the potential of Instagram for public health monitoring and surveillance for DDI, ADR, and behavioral pathology at large.
 Most social media analysis focuses on Twitter and Facebook, but Instagram is an increasingly important platform, especially among teens, with unrestricted access of public posts, high availability of posts with geolocation coordinates, and images to supplement textual analysis.
 Using drug, symptom, and natural product dictionaries for identi cation of the various types of DDI and ADR evidence, we have collected close to 7000 user timelines spanning from October 2010 to June 2015.
 This allows the potential extraction of ADR and DDI that manifest at di erent time scales.
 From this data, we demonstrate that Instagram user timelines contain substantial data of interest to characterize DDI, ADR, and natural product use.
 To explore this data we have developed a monitoring tool to easily observe user-level timelines associated with drug and symptom terms of interest, which we describe below.
 To explore population-level associations at the di erent temporal scales, we compute knowledge networks that our previous work has shown to be useful for automated fact-checking,15 protein- protein interaction extraction,16 and recommender systems.17,18 To illustrate the potential of data-driven, population-level associations, we use spectral methods to reveal network mod- ules of symptoms and drugs, for instance those involved in psoriasis pathology.
 The proximity networks Pw(X) also allow us to visualize, explore and search the concep- tual space of drugs, symptoms, and NP as they co-occur in the depression timeline dataset.
 The largest connected component of the proximity network for w = 1 week is shown in Figure 5A.
 Our preliminary analysis demonstrates that Instagram is a very powerful source of data of potential bene t to monitor and uncover DDI and ADR.
