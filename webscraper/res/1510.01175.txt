 Relational information about users, devices, and cookies was provided, as well as other in- formation on IP addresses and behavior.
 See appendix Dataset and the of cial challenge webpage [14] for more information about the dataset provided in this challenge.
 The initial list of candidates is every cookie with known handle that appears in any of these IP addresses.
 Rule 2: If the previous rule returned an empty set of candidates: We create a set that contains the device s IP addresses that appear in less than twenty ve devices and less than fty cookies.
 The initial list of candidates is every with known handle cookie that appears in any of these IP addresses.
 Rule 3: If the previous rule returned an empty set of candidates: We create a set that contains the device s IP addresses.
 The initial list of candidates is every cookie with known handle that appears in any of these IP addresses.
 Rule 4: If the previous rule returned an empty set of candidates: We create a set that contains the device s IP addresses.
 For devices where the second candidate scores less than 0.1 the average F0.5 score is higher than 0.99 and 62% of the devices satisfy that condition.
 We have also created these sets in order to extract features that represents the relation between the device and the cookie: ID1: It contains IP addresses visited by the device.
