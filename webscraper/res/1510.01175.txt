 Relational information about users, devices, and cookies was provided, as well as other in- formation on IP addresses and behavior.
 Initial selection of candidates It is not possible to create a training set containing every combination of devices and cookies due to the high number of them.
 The initial list of candidates is every cookie with known handle that appears in any of these IP addresses.
 The initial list of candidates is every with known handle cookie that appears in any of these IP addresses.
 Rule 3: If the previous rule returned an empty set of candidates: We create a set that contains the device s IP addresses.
 The initial list of candidates is every cookie with known handle that appears in any of these IP addresses.
 Rule 4: If the previous rule returned an empty set of candidates: We create a set that contains the device s IP addresses.
 CONCLUSIONS In this paper we have presented the design, implementation and evaluation of a way to match devices and cookies to deal with the Cross-Device tracking problem.
 You were provided with relational It provides information that describe each IP across all the devices or cookies seen on that IP.
 Contains the joint behaviour (Freq Countl, Count 1, Count 2, Count 3, Count 4 and Count C5) of the device or cookie b on the IP address a.
 We have also created these sets in order to extract features that represents the relation between the device and the cookie: ID1: It contains IP addresses visited by the device.
 ID2: It contains IP addresses visited by the device that appear in less than ten devices and twenty cookies.
