 Responses indicate that participants hold nuanced opinions on security and privacy trade-o s, with most recognizing legitimate uses for the practice, but also concerned about threats from hackers or government surveillance.
 There is strong support for noti cation and consent when a system is intercepting their encrypted tra c, although this support varies depending on the situation.
 A signi cant concern about malicious uses of TLS inspection is identity theft, and many would react negatively and some would change their behavior if they discovered inspection occurring without their knowledge.
 We also nd that a small but signi cant number of participants are jaded by the current state of a airs and have lost any expectation of privacy. 1.
 To address the risks related to instructing participants on an issue and then surveying them, we spent considerable e ort and time crafting our description of TLS proxies.
 Our goals were to (1) give a simple and concise overview of how TLS proxies are used to inspect encrypted tra c, and (2) present participants with a fair and unbiased description of how the inspection of encrypted tra c could be used for both benevolent and malicious purposes.
 We speculate that due to the e ects of illusory superiority, the number of participants that were unaware of TLS proxies before the survey was even higher than reported [8, 9].
 Interestingly, in our survey participants indicated a high level of acceptance for TLS proxies, which could suggest that real-world acceptance of TLS proxies than we measured.
 On the other hand, many participants reported wanting to have their consent obtained, or at least be noti ed of, the inspection of encrypted tra c; in practice, it is possible that fewer participants would actually be is even higher interested in being noti ed.
 In both cases there is still strong support for either noti cation or 5As before, we speculate that due to the e ects of illusory superiority, the number of participants that were unaware of TLS proxies before the survey was even higher than reported [8, 9].
