 This allowed us to measure emotions expressed in the tweets posted from an area, the structure of social connections, and also use that area s socioeconomic characteristics in analysis.
 We use the standard English version of SentiStrength2 to each tweet in our dataset, quantifying positive sentiment P [+1, +5] and negative sentiment N [ 1, 5], consistently with the Positive and Negative Affect Sched- ule (PANAS) (Watson, Clark, and Tellegen 2013).
 In contrast, tracts associated with message expressing higher dominance, Figure 5(b), are associated with signi cantly weaker social ties (p < 0.01).
 Since weak ties are associated with more diverse social relationships, our observation con rms the relationship between emotions and diversity of network structure.
 The correlation between tie strength and positive sentiment while weaker, is also negative, sug- gesting that tracts with more positive tweets have weaker ties.
 In this case, negative correlation with tie strength means that tracts with more negative tweets have stronger ties than tracts with less negative tweets.
 This result is in line with theories of social regulation of emotions (Rim e 2009) and with previous results in protest movements that showed how online negative emotions were associated with stronger col- lective action (Alvarez et al. 2015).
 We also report the relationship between affect of a tract and the spatial diversity of users tweeting from that tract, a measure of inter-tract mobility de ned in Section .
 Demographics and Social Ties We nd a relationship between demographic characteris- tics of tracts from which people tweet and the social struc- ture of tweeting users.
 Table 2 reports correlations between average per-tract social tie strength, spatial diversity and de- mographic variables extracted from US Census data.
