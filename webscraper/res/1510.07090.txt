 In the rest of the paper, we rst describe data collection and methods used to measure emotion and social structure.
 Shea et al. (Shea et al. 2015) tested these theories in a laboratory, examining the relationship between emotions and the structure of networks people were able to recall.
 Emotion and Social Ties Table 1 reports correlations between affect and the struc- ture of social interactions measured from tweets.
 In contrast, tracts associated with message expressing higher dominance, Figure 5(b), are associated with signi cantly weaker social ties (p < 0.01).
 In this case, negative correlation with tie strength means that tracts with more negative tweets have stronger ties than tracts with less negative tweets.
 As shown in Figure 6, tracts with more positive tweets have signi - cantly higher spatial diversity than tracts with less positive tweets (p < 0.001).
 Table 2: Correlation between demographic characteristics of tracts and measures of social structure of people tweeting from these tracts.
 Demographics and Social Ties We nd a relationship between demographic characteris- tics of tracts from which people tweet and the social struc- ture of tweeting users.
 While a previous study (Eagle, Macy, and Claxton 2010) of the re- lationship between social structure and economic prosperity used somewhat different indicators e.g., they used net- work diversity to measure diversity of social contacts we reach qualitatively similar conclusions.
 Speci cally, we nd a negative correlation between (mean) income, one measure of economic prosperity, and sociability: higher incomes are associated with weaker social ties.
