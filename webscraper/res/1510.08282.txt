 Classical cognitive theories indicate triggering among the knowledge units to be one of the most important reasons behind accelerated knowledge building in collaborative KBEs.
 We use the concept of ecosystem and the triggering phenomenon to highlight the necessity for the right mix of users in a KBE.
 In a crowdsourced knowledge building system, the knowledge-generation process is outsourced to a commu- nity of users (Doan, Ramakrishnan, & Halevy, 2011).
 Some of the knowledge building systems effectively exploiting the bene ts of crowdsourcing are Wikipedia, StackOver ow and Quora.
 These systems aggregate the human knowledge on various topics and have been successful in making use of the immense potential of the masses.
 Many of these sys- tems also make use of various incentivizing mechanisms to motivate users to participate more in the knowledge building process (Anderson, Huttenlocher, Kleinberg, & Leskovec, 2013).
 Due to the ease of access of internet, the process of knowledge building has further evolved (Saxton, Oh, & Kishore, 2013).
 Even knowledge seekers are participating in the knowledge building process by for example, asking ques- tions (Wang, Gill, Mohanlal, Zheng, & Zhao, 2013; Hanra- han, Convertino, & Nelson, 2012).
 Each of these categories possesses a different skill set and partic- ipates in the knowledge building process in a different man- ner.
 Internal Knowledge Internal knowledge is a subset of the user s knowledge which is added to the system independent of the effect of group dynamics.
