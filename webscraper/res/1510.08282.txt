 In a crowdsourced knowledge building system, the knowledge-generation process is outsourced to a commu- nity of users (Doan, Ramakrishnan, & Halevy, 2011).
 Some of the knowledge building systems effectively exploiting the bene ts of crowdsourcing are Wikipedia, StackOver ow and Quora.
 Even knowledge seekers are participating in the knowledge building process by for example, asking ques- tions (Wang, Gill, Mohanlal, Zheng, & Zhao, 2013; Hanra- han, Convertino, & Nelson, 2012).
 The paper provides a thorough investigation of the crowd- sourced knowledge building process in terms of ecosystem and triggering.
 Related Work In the past, most of the models on knowledge building have focused on various characteristics that a KBE should possess.
 However, the characteristics of users that are participating in the knowledge building process have not been well under- stood.
 We apply the same concept to the knowledge building process, where users are the cognitive systems who build knowledge in the KBE.
 The theorem also helps computing the triggered knowledge contribution in the knowledge building, as shown by the corollary that follows.
 We observe that as we keep changing the distribution of users across categories, we get different amount of knowledge produced with respect to time.
 In that context, we try to nd the ideal distribution which acceler- ates the knowledge building process to the best possible ex- tent.
