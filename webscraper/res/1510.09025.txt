 The of v, and let ds analogous de nition is used for listening out-degree (d(cid:96)+ G(v)) and in-degree (d(cid:96) G(v)).
 We say there is a speaking path of length k from v to u if there exists a set of directed edges svv1, sv1v2, . . . , svku Es and edges (cid:96)uvk , (cid:96)vkvk 1, . . . , (cid:96)v1v E(cid:96).
 Since (cid:96)wv / E(cid:96), if for any node z we have z Rs G,k(v), then, by the de nition of reachability, there exists a path from v to z that does not use edge svw.
 In step 7 there is exactly one large component (see also Lemma 17), and the number components without a direct edge to T1 is reduced by one.
 If there exists v, w V such that svw Es and (cid:96)wv / E(cid:96), then with probability at least 1 , the edge svw is chosen.
 The probability of selecting svw and (cid:96)wv consecutively 1 1 n 2 n 1 is at least .
 Moreover, we know that if svw and (cid:96)wv are selected in sequence then both will be removed as svw is removable, and then (cid:96)wv will be removable by Lemma 26.
 Hence, the distance from x to y is k + 1 if we remove edge xx(cid:48) where x(cid:48) = x1, . . . , xD, y0.
 We let f (G, c, k) [0, 1] be the percentage of removable edges in G for the model speci ed by c R+, k {2, 3, . . . , }.
 We can de ne an analogous local version f (v, c, k) [0, 1] as the percentage of removable edges going out from v.
