 The of v, and let ds analogous de nition is used for listening out-degree (d(cid:96)+ G(v)) and in-degree (d(cid:96) G(v)).
 Note that, at the beginning of step 7 there is a single large component (otherwise we would be in step 5 or 6).
 If there exists v, w V such that svw Es and (cid:96)wv / E(cid:96), then with probability at least 1 , the edge svw is chosen.
 The probability of selecting svw and (cid:96)wv consecutively (cid:18) 1 (cid:19)2 1 1 n 2 n 1 is at least .
 We rst consider nontrivial ranges of parameters k > 1 and cs, c(cid:96) n 1 (see Section 5.1 for a discussion of extremal parameter ranges and networks).
 The vertices are labeled by strings x0 . . . xD 1 of length D with xi {0, . . . , d} with xi (cid:54)= xi+1.
 Hence, |Rs G(v)| n 1 where equality occurs if and only if all other nodes are reachable from v.
 For k = , if 0 cs n 1 and 0 c(cid:96) n 1, then the cycle C is pairwise stable.
 If cs, c(cid:96) > 1 then the empty graph is ef cient and is the only stable graph.
 We let f (G, c, k) [0, 1] be the percentage of removable edges in G for the model speci ed by c R+, k {2, 3, . . . , }.
