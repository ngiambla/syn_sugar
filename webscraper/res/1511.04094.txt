 It integrates theories of media choice with theories of global cultural consumption and tests them by analyzing shared audience traffic between the world s 1000 most popular Websites.
 They believe in the power of cultural proximity, and the continued ability of cultural structures like language and geography to shape audiences (Consalvo, M. 2011).
 We analyze data on audience duplication (the extent to which users who access site A also access site B) across these sites to identify patterns of global Web use.
 To explain the level of audience duplication, we use cultural factors such as similarity of language and geography, and institutional factors such as hyperlinks between each pair of Websites.
 Essentially, the imperialism school privileges the role of institutions such as media industries and government regulators in structuring global cultural consumption.
 To recap, the dependent variable in the regression analysis is the audience duplication between all possible pairs of Websites (obtained from the audience network).
 The independent variables are language similarity, geographic similarity, genre similarity and number of hyperlinks between each of these pairs of Websites.
 In other words, cultural structures like language and geography are far more potent determinants of global audience formation than institutional structures like the presence of hyperlinks or firewalls.
 The regression model used in this study, in particular the interaction term between language and geography, helps isolate the role of each.
