 It integrates theories of media choice with theories of global cultural consumption and tests them by analyzing shared audience traffic between the world s 1000 most popular Websites.
 We find that language and geographic similarities are more powerful predictors of audience overlap than hyperlinks and genre similarity, highlighting the role of cultural structures in shaping global media use.
 They believe in the power of cultural proximity, and the continued ability of cultural structures like language and geography to shape audiences (Consalvo, M. 2011).
 We analyze data on audience duplication (the extent to which users who access site A also access site B) across these sites to identify patterns of global Web use.
 To explain the level of audience duplication, we use cultural factors such as similarity of language and geography, and institutional factors such as hyperlinks between each pair of Websites.
 We find that global Web usage largely clusters according to language and geography of these Websites, and not according to their content genres.
 This study contributes to that debate by explaining how Web audiences around the world make choices between domestic and foreign content.
 In doing so, it is one of the first studies to test the relative power of both cultural and institutional structures.
 Conversely, we find the number of hyperlinks between Websites explains very little audience overlap, suggesting that Web users don t necessarily follow hyperlinks.
 In other words, cultural structures like language and geography are far more potent determinants of global audience formation than institutional structures like the presence of hyperlinks or firewalls.
