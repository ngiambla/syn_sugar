 Not surprisingly, these new Internet corpora have attracted the attention of linguists of diverse backgrounds and opened the doors to new and innovative studies on how language use varies both geographically and over time (Nguyen et al. 2015) in different languages.
 In this work, we build on our previous efforts (Gon alves / S nchez 2014) and use Twitter to empirically define Spanish geographically consistent dialects.
 Cluster corresponds to the speech used in largely populated areas (an international variety) while cluster is mostly encountered in rural areas and is thus related to local varieties.
 From these, we selected the subset of tweets containing geolocation information and used the Google s Compact Language Detection (McCandless 2012) library to identify all tweets written in Spanish.
 We assign to superdialect an international Spanish variety understood and propagated mostly in the main urban centers and likely related to official media. 7 Figure 4: After a cluster analysis, cells represented in Fig. 1 fall into two large clusters or superdialects, represented by red (superdialect ) and blue (superdialect ) dots.
 We identify three distinct regional dialects, as shown in Fig 5, corresponding, respectively, to the Iberian Peninsula (in blue), North America, Central America and the Northern part of South America (in orange) and the Southern Cone (in green).
 The former dialect has been more influenced over the years by a closer relationship with the European metropolis (see also the blue dots in the Mexican plateau).
 In contrast, the Rioplatense Spanish has its own personality due to later settlement of the region and less contact with the prestigious norm radiating from Spain during the colonial age.
 Using a completely new list of concepts and related words and a much larger geolocated Twitter corpus, we recover a more detailed geographical 10 picture of the two superdialects identified and characterize the regional variations observed.
 The robustness of our results points the way towards a deeper understanding of vernacular language and opens the doors to more detailed empirical studies of language usage and evolution across the world.
