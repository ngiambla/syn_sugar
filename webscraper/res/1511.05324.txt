 Scienti c research is increasingly conducted in networks of scientists, crowdsourced volunteers and amateurs, and networked machine resources, and many more examples.
 Moreover, the functional, experiential, and social motivations appear to be roughly equally important [Zhou et al. 2011].
 What is particularly unique for MOGs and VWs, however, is the sense of immersion or ow [Yee 2006].
 Flow experience is the men- tal state of being fully absorbed and losing track of time [Goel et al. 2013].
 The more users there are, the more interactive and complex the virtual environment is.
 In order to guarantee continuous growth of the MOG/VW, one can reduce the learning and personalization costs in the short term [Zhang et al. 2014].
 They require the highest level of involvement from users in terms of time and effort.
 Users can modify and reject each other s contributions and affect the project as a whole.
 Their contributions and the project content are often monitored and adjusted by the project leaders.
 Wikis enable the simultaneous collaborative cre- ation, modi cation, and deletion of content [Tapscott and Williams 2011].
