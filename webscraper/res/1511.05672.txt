 The typing data consists of numerical elements, which correspond to time periods in microseconds that elapse between consecutive key press events and time between key press and key release events.
 RELATED WORK Keystroke Dynamics is the process of monitoring and analyzing the typing behavior of users on a computer keyboard and is extensively studied in last two decades, with the main focus on user authentication.
 We believe that an application that classi es computer users according to their age groups using typing data is an interesting new research challenge.
 In this study, digraph measure is used to compose the dataset, as preferred in majority of the studies for Keystroke Dynamics.
 In order to make comparative studies with the Keystroke Dynamics Benchmark Dataset [3], the dataset is composed in an identical format.
 The time period between the key press and release events for the same key M , which is the duration time for that key, is shortened as D(M).
 ANALYSIS Using the collected dataset, we attempt to analyze the performance of discriminating child typing samples from adult typing samples.
 In this method, we compute the mean feature vector for the training set for both age groups as the rst step.
 Typing this password phrase is a relatively harder task for the subjects, for which they occasionally had to look at the screen.
 In this dataset the nth feature vector (sample row) is concatenation of the nth feature vector of the Turkish dataset and the password dataset.
 The equal error rates for concatenated dataset are always lower than those obtained for the password dataset, hence, it can be said that password dataset is the worst alternative for discriminating age groups.
