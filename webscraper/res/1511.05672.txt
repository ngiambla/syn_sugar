 To protect children from such threats, in this study, we investigate how successfully typing data can be used to distinguish children from adults.
 For this purpose, we collect a dataset comprising keystroke data of 100 users and show that distinguishing child Internet users from adults is possible using Keystroke Dynamics with equal error rates less than 10 percent.
 Initially, the subjects were greeted by a welcome screen, in which they entered their name, surname, gender, year of birth and class (for primary school students only) information.
 The only information that is required for our current work is the year of age, but we also retained name and surname in order to recognize a subject in case they may provide data at future sessions and also for future studies.
 Lastly, gender data is used to build a dataset with equal number of males and females in each age group.
 In the next step, the users were confronted with a short survey including questions that may be related to their typing behavior.
 Then, training samples are given as inputs to the neural network with the outputs set to +1 for adult February 1, 2016 DRAFT 12 typing samples and -1 for child typing samples.
 RESULTS We test and compare the classi cation methods described in the previous section for classifying typing samples of adult and children participants.
 Type-1 error is the ratio of adult typing samples mislabeled as child sample to all adult typing samples and type-2 error is the ratio of child typing samples mislabeled as adult sample to all child typing samples.
 A question that may be relevant for using the same phrase for all users is that whether it is realistic to expect users type the same phrase in a real life application.
