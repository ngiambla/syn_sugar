 Especially for lifestyle diseases, such as obesity, drink- ing or smoking, images of social gatherings could provide information that is not necessarily shared in, say, tweets.
 In this study, we explore whether (i) tags provided by the users and (ii) annotations obtained via automatic image tagging are indeed valuable for studying public health.
 We nd that both user-provided and machine-generated tags provide information that can be used to infer a county s health statistics.
 Whereas for most statistics user-provided tags are better features, for predicting ex- cessive drinking machine-generated tags such as liquid and glass yield better models.
 Mejova et al. [14] use Foursquare and Insta- gram images to study food consumption patterns in the US, and nd a correlation between obesity and fast food restaurants.
 For ex- ample, Sadilek et al. [22], build a classi er to identify the health of a user based on their Twitter usage.
 Our study is di erent from the ones dis- cussed above in that we propose the use of image data to study public health.
 Abdullah, et al. [2] use smile recognition from images posted on social media to study and quantify the overall societal happiness.
 Andalibi et al. [3] study depression related images on Instagram and establish[ed] the im- portance of visual imagery as a vehicle for expressing aspects of depression .
 In our work, we study if the use of image recognition techniques helps in understanding a broader range of health related issues.
