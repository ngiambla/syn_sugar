 In this study, we explore whether (i) tags provided by the users and (ii) annotations obtained via automatic image tagging are indeed valuable for studying public health.
 We nd that both user-provided and machine-generated tags provide information that can be used to infer a county s health statistics.
 Whereas for most statistics user-provided tags are better features, for predicting ex- cessive drinking machine-generated tags such as liquid and glass yield better models.
 The insights obtained from this study could be of use in designing systems for understanding and monitoring substance abuse and other stigmatized behaviors.
 We nd that both user-provided and machine-generated labels for geo-tagged Instagram images hold valuable information in predicting county-level health statistics.
 Though for most variables user-provided labels outper- form machine-generated ones, the opposite holds for Excessive Drinking . 1http://read.bi/1ouGzgQ, last accessed on July 13, 2015.
 Mejova et al. [14] use Foursquare and Insta- gram images to study food consumption patterns in the US, and nd a correlation between obesity and fast food restaurants.
 Andalibi et al. [3] study depression related images on Instagram and establish[ed] the im- portance of visual imagery as a vehicle for expressing aspects of depression .
 In our work, we study if the use of image recognition techniques helps in understanding a broader range of health related issues.
 Imagga is not a restaurant- or food-speci c annotation tool and its model is trained on general images.
 Example output for the Imagga Auto-Tagging Demo for one of the Instagram images in our data set.
 CONCLUSIONS In this paper, we studied if social media image data can be used to understand public health.
 Machine-generated tags such as glass , liquid and beverage (Figure 3) are all found to be good predictors, and such tags might not be part of human annotations.
