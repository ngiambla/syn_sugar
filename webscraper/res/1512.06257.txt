 In this paper, we present WITS, an end-to-end web-based in-home monitoring system for convenient and e cient care delivery.
 The core com- ponents consist of a novel shared-structure dictionary learning approach com- bined with rule-based reasoning for continuous daily activity tracking and abnormal activities detection.
 WITS also exploits an Internet of Things (IoT) middleware for the scalable and seamless management and learning of the in- formation produced by ambient sensors.
 We further develop a user-friendly interface, which runs on both iOS and Andriod, as well as in Chrome, for the e cient customization of WITS monitoring services without programming e orts.
 IoT also bring new opportunities by facilitating the collection and re ection of diverse information in the physical world.
 We propose a novel Web-based personal-wellness monitoring system to ob- serve and quantify the residents activities and abnormalities at homes.
 Several software components are included in this part for ltering and cleaning raw sensor data, and adapting such data for high-level applications.
 Since some devices work with more than one sensor and the sensor readings may come asynchronously, a data access processor is used to allow the system to provide data synchronously, which lays the foundation of interoperability for smart home applications [8].
 A complex activity is de ned as a set of activities, multiple objects, and symbolic locations involved in a complex activity.
 For example, cooking is a complex activity, including a series of ac- tions like walking, moving arms, standing etc, and a set of objects such as chop-board, knives, and oven.
