 In this paper, we present WITS, an end-to-end web-based in-home monitoring system for convenient and e cient care delivery.
 The core com- ponents consist of a novel shared-structure dictionary learning approach com- bined with rule-based reasoning for continuous daily activity tracking and abnormal activities detection.
 WITS also exploits an Internet of Things (IoT) middleware for the scalable and seamless management and learning of the in- formation produced by ambient sensors.
 IoT also bring new opportunities by facilitating the collection and re ection of diverse information in the physical world.
 We propose a novel Web-based personal-wellness monitoring system to ob- serve and quantify the residents activities and abnormalities at homes.
 The proposed system employs a series of core algorithms to recognize and track people s daily routines of activities and to further identify abnormalities.
 This involves designing an easy use and powerful interface for accessing, exchanging, and manipulating information from the smart homes, which is what most of the existing smart home systems lack, to pursue the user satisfactions.
 Various services and their semantic information are abstracted as universal services in WITS and represented as icons on the graphical interface.
 This component works in a scalable, plug-and-play fashion, where new sensors can be easily plugged-in and old sensors can be easily re- moved.
 Several software components are included in this part for ltering and cleaning raw sensor data, and adapting such data for high-level applications.
 The data collection and processing of WITS are fully implemented using the Microsoft .NET framework, and data are analyzed using MATLAB 2014a.
 We propose a novel hybrid activity recognition framework that integrates multi-task based dictionary learning and rule-based reasoning for better performance.
