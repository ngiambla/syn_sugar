 This article presents DisCor-T, a novel graph-based ap- proach for discovering underlying connections of things via mining the rich content embodied in the human- thing interactions in terms of user, temporal and spatial information.
 Then, random walk with restart (RWR) is applied to nd proximities among things, and a relational graph of things (RGT) indicating implicit correlations of things is learned.
 We rstly extract two types of graphs, namely the location-time-thing graph (Figure 2(a)) and the user-thing graph (Figure 2(b)).
 The graphs are deduced from thing usage events, which re ect object and its three related information in terms of spatio-temporal and social aspects.
 Then we perform random walk on these two graphs respectively to inference relationships of pairwise things, and sum them up as the overall pairwise correlations of things.

 The algorithm can be divided into two stages: i) extracting features from the top-k cor- relation graph G and things, and ii) performing multi-label classi cation of things.
 We extract three kinds of features FL, FS and FC from RGT in terms of label property, link structures and node attributes respectively.
 In our work, we extend the model to the relational network of things where a thing s usage history not only indicates user and temporal information, but also location in- formation.
 In particular, we explore the relation between spatial information and temporal information by exploring the periodical pattern in human interactions on things. 6.2.
