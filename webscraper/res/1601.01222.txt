 We then conjecture that our service-oriented community and fractal social organization ful ll those requirements and therefore constitute an e ective strat- egy to design pervasive social computing environments.
 In order to motivate our conjecture, in this paper we discuss a model of social translucence and discuss frac- tal social organization as a referral service empowering a social system s parts and whole. 1 Introduction Several are the de nitions of pervasive social computing (PSC) that may be found in the literature.
 More than this, PSC favors the emergence of a coherent and pur- poseful social behavior from a set of mostly inde- pendent individual behaviors.
 In so doing, social translucence is realized: actors become aware of the win-wins the mutually rewarding relationships that they may enact and exploit.
 At the same time, the SCE makes it possible to optimize the tasks of the parts (the social actors) and those of the whole (the social system).
 As an example, if S is the animal kingdom, then a behavior such as b = production of oxygen would be considered as bene cial, and therefore S(b) = 1.
 We can now de ne a mutualistic precondition: De nition 10 (Mutualistic precondition) Let D and R, BD and BR, and ID and IR be de ned as above.
 Fractal social organization as a foundation to pervasive social computing services 7 Then the following conditions are called the mutualistic precondition (MP) between D and R: b BD : D(b) 0 R( (b)) > 0 (4) c BR : R(c) 0 D( 1(c)) > 0 The rst formula, (4), states that there exists a be- havior in BD that is interpreted as positive or neutral, though its occurrence produces positive returns for R.
 De nition 13 (Social translucence) Given a set of S holds, social translucence social systems S for which is the property to making all involved social systems aware that S holds.
 Achieving social translucence thus means that the SCE of a SoC makes use of the notify() method of Fig. 2 to spread awareness of the existence of a be- haviour (in fact, a service request) that, once enacted, would result in a mutualistic relationship.
