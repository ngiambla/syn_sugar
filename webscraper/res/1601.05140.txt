 The challenge was to identify influence bots supporting a pro- vaccination discussion on Twitter.
 Number of known bots followed by a user a user following several known bots is more likely to be a bot.
 Some teams added features once the Challenge started and some bots had been discovered.
 Sentimetrix started with 66 features (which increased to 175 by the end), Indiana used 98, and USC used 47.
 The next 21 bots were detected using a combination of network analysis (e.g., connection to known bots), content and sentiment analysis, and semi- supervised clustering of users based on the above- described features.
 The Indiana team identified additional bots by computing the cosine similarity between users and known bots.
 USC and Sentimetrix looked at number of tweets posted over extended periods of times), linguistic cues (e.g.
 Once a certain number of bots and humans are found, we can identify other bots using standard classifiers.
 These interfaces must include effective visualizations that highlight the top suspect accounts and explain why they are suspicious.
 The Initial Bot Detection Step needs to be supported by a large collection of tools that systematically cover the search space.
