 There is a vocal anti- vaccination community both on the Internet and on Twitter [2] and other relevant social media.
 Number of known bots followed by a user a user following several known bots is more likely to be a bot.
 Number/Percentage of bots in the cluster that a user belonged to if a clustering algorithm places the user in a cluster with many bots, he is more likely to be a bot.
 Some teams added features once the Challenge started and some bots had been discovered.
 Sentimetrix started with 66 features (which increased to 175 by the end), Indiana used 98, and USC used 47.
 Teams were then able to use insights from past work [1,3] to identify a small number of initial bots by manually inspecting suspicious accounts.
 For instance, Sentimetrix identified 4 initial bots this way and then used clustering and network analysis (see Section III.B) to identify 25 more bots.
 They then used Support Vector Machines (SVM) to predict the remaining 10 bots using the features described in this section and the analytic tools of Section III.B.
 Some users are marked as bots (these are users identified as bots by the system and confirmed by human inspection).
 A user summary described how complete the user profile is and a description of the person (e.g. follower- followee ratio).
