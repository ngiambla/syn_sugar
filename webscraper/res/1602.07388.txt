 We nd that the a signi cant source of behavioral heterogeneity is the number of existing answers to questions.
 The Programming Puzzles & Code Golf community had the highest number of average an- 2https://archive.org/details/stackexchange 3http://meta.stackexchange.com/how-does-reputation- work be qualitatively the same.
 Furthermore, the deviance ratio of voters tends to increase with the number of answers, suggesting increasing agreement with our model.
 We nd that voters are more likely to choose an answer that is eventually accepted (the regression coe cients are positive), but, curiously, voters are even more likely to choose the answer after it is accepted as the number of answers in- crease (the regression coe cient is usually even higher, and increases with the number of answers).
 Users increasingly depend on the web page order of an answer as the number of answers increases.

 The goal of our study was to understand what factors in uence users to vote for, or accept, particular answers.
 First, model parameters describing the dependence of behavior on answer s web page order and word share increase with the number of available answers.
 Such dependence would not necessarily exist if web page order and word share were merely proxies for answer quality.
 For all boards, there is a decreasingly signi cant dependence on the order in which answers appear.
