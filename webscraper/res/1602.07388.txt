 We analyze data from 250 communities on the Stack Exchange network to pinpoint factors a ecting which answers are cho- sen as the best answers.
 Our results suggest that, rather than evaluate all available answers to a question, users rely on simple cognitive heuristics to choose an answer to vote for or accept.
 The goal of our study was to understand what factors in uence users to vote for, or accept, particular answers.
 Analysis from our models of voter and asker behavior suggest that Stack Exchange users rely on simple cognitive heuristics to choose an answer to vote for or accept, especially as the num- ber of answers available increases.
 First, model parameters describing the dependence of behavior on answer s web page order and word share increase with the number of available answers.
 Such dependence would not necessarily exist if web page order and word share were merely proxies for answer quality.
 Finally, voters are more likely to vote for an answer after it is accepted than before that very same answer is accepted as the number of available answers grow.
 Not only does acceptance appear to change a user s judgment of answer quality, it appears to become an increasingly strong bias with the number of answers.
 For askers and voters after acceptance, newer answers are preferred, while, for voters before acceptance, older answers are preferred.
