 While the importance of topology in geostrategy has long been recognized [4], [5], the role of spatial patterns in determining a region s vulnerability to con ict is not well understood.
 Here, we use network science to show that global patterns in war and peace are closely related to the relative position of cities in a global interaction network.
 This metric is also a good predictor of the distance to a con ict zone and can estimate the risk of con ict.
 We go on to show that the spatial network of cities is closely related to violence, and propose a simple model to account for the phenomenon.
 Fig. 2 shows scatter plots of the number of terrorist attacks A(z) against the network metrics, with panel plots for both the probability of being a major con ict zone, and the distance to the nearest major con ict zone.
 A major con ict zone is one that experiences persistent con ict, which is de ned as having suffered over 100 attacks between 2002 and 2014 (equivalent to at least 78% of the years being under attack see Supplementary Information (SI)).
 A zone with high strategic centrality has a high probability of being in major con ict (P (A(z) > 100) >0.7) and is close to existing con ict zones (<50 km).
 Cities are connected by a spatial network, as in the empirical case above, and each city has the capacity to in uence the states of its neighbours.
 The shortest path of travelling between a city m to any other city n is de ned as the path with the least number of hops.
 The unnormalised betweenness of a city Bv is de ned as the number of shortest paths that pass through this city: B(v) = mn(v), (1) (cid:88) m(cid:54)=n(cid:54)=v v Vz the zone), i.e., B(z) =(cid:80) where m,n(v) is the shortest path between m and n that goes through city i.
