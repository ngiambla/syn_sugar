 This metric is also a good predictor of the distance to a con ict zone and can estimate the risk of con ict.
 We go on to show that the spatial network of cities is closely related to violence, and propose a simple model to account for the phenomenon.
 We use two standard network measures: degree D (number of neighbouring connected cities) and betweenness B (number of shortest paths which pass through the city in question).
 We nd a robust empirical relationship between con ict and network measures: high degree cities are peaceful and far from the nearest con ict zones, whereas high betweenness cities are often engulfed in persistent violence.
 Examples of the highest degree cities are in Western Europe and are far from the nearest con ict zones (Fig. 1c).
 Cities are connected by a spatial network, as in the empirical case above, and each city has the capacity to in uence the states of its neighbours.
 Each city is also tagged with its country and province af liation. 2) Con ict data: two data sets are used, (1) terrorism and insurgency violence, and (2) conventional warfare.
 For terrorism and insurgency violence: the Global Terrorism Database (GTD) [31] database is used, with over 30,000 con ict incidents between 2002 to 2014.
 Nonetheless, we present the results for = 0 (no weighting) and = 1 (full weighting) in the SI to demonstrate the robustness of the methodology.
 The strategic centrality for a zone z as S(z) = B(z) D(z), which normalises the betweenness of a city by the number of links.
 A city with a high betweenness will have global interaction importance, while a low degree (more isolated) will increase its vulnerability to con ict.
 The degree of the node or the zone is D1(v) = D1(z) = 2N if the relay node is connected to all N nodes in the cores.
