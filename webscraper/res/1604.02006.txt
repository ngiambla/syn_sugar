 However, there is a huge gap between our ability to acquire, store, and process data and our ability to make effective use of the data to advance discovery.
 Despite successful automation of routine aspects of data management and analytics, most elements of the scientific process currently require considerable human expertise and effort.
 Brahe, Kepler, and Newton were all engaged in the practice of science, a systematic process for acquiring knowledge through observation or experimentation and developing theories to describe and explain natural phenomena.
 Today, the experimental instruments are more powerful, the scientific questions more complex, and the mathematical, statistical and computational methods for analyzing data have become more sophisticated.
 Arguably, big data accelerates Brahe s part of the scientific endeavor, and increasingly, Kepler s part, with the increasing use of machine learning for building models from data.
 In what follows, we argue that the emergence of big data and the ability to examine natural processes using the computational lens (Karp, 2011), offer the possibility of rapid acceleration of science.
 Hence, computing, the science of information processing, offers a powerful formal framework and exploratory apparatus for the conduct of science (Djorgovski, 2005).
 Of particular interest are expressive yet computationally tractable languages for representing and reasoning with scientific arguments, and their uncertainty and provenance.
 However, there is a huge gap between our ability to acquire, store, and process data and our ability to make effective use of the data to advance science.
 Despite successful automation of routine aspects of data management and analytics, most elements of the scientific process currently constitute rate- limiting steps in the scientific process.
