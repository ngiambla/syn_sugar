 The COALITIONAL MANIPULATION problem with (cid:96) manipulators many-to-one reduces to WEAK MANIPULATION, OPPORTUNISTIC MANIPULATION, and STRONG MANIPULATION problems with (cid:96) manipulators for all voting rules and for all positive integers (cid:96).
 Follows from the fact that every instance of the COALITIONAL MANIPULATION problem is also an equivalent instance of the WEAK MANIPULATION, OPPORTUNISTIC MANIPULATION, and STRONG MANIPULATION problems.
 The WEAK MANIPULATION problem is NP-complete for Bucklin, simpli ed Bucklin, Fall- back, and simpli ed Fallback voting rules, even when we have only one manipulator and the number of undetermined pairs in each vote is no more than 16.
 Let (U = {u1, . . . , um}, S := {S1, S2, . . . , St}) be an instance of X3C, where each Si is a subset of U of size three.
 W (cid:31) X (cid:31) Si (cid:31) c (cid:31) (U \ Si) (cid:31) D \ ({X ({c} Si)}) , i (cid:54) t 12 Notice that the number of undetermined pairs in every vote in P is 16.
 We introduce the following additional complete votes Q: (cid:66) t copies of U (cid:31) c (cid:31) others (cid:66) m/3 1 copies of U (cid:31) a (cid:31) c (cid:31) others (cid:66) m/3 + 1 copies of D (cid:31) b (cid:31) others The total number of voters, including the manipulator, is 2t + 2m/3 + 1.
 Now we show that the X3C instance (U, S) is a YES instance if and only if the OPPORTUNISTIC MANIPULATION instance (P Q, 1, c) is a NO instance.
 Notice that we can assume without loss of generality that the manipulator places c at the rst position, d at the second position, the candidate ui at (m + 5 i)th position for every i [m], and y at the last position, since otherwise c can never win uniquely irrespective of the extension of P (that it, the manipulator s vote looks like c (cid:31) d (cid:31) {z1, z2} (cid:31) um (cid:31) um 1 (cid:31) (cid:31) u1 (cid:31) y).
 The STRONG MANIPULATION problem is in P for the Bucklin, simpli ed Bucklin, Fall- back, and simpli ed Fallback voting rules, for any number of manipulators.
 Let (C, P, M, c) be an instance of STRONG MANIPULATION for simpli ed Bucklin, and let m denote the total number of candidates in this instance.
