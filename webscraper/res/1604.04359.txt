 OPPORTUNISTIC MANIPULATION: the manipulators seek to vote in a way that makes their preferred candidate win in every viable extension of the partial votes of the non- manipulators. 3.
 Similarly, it is easy to show, that the COALITIONAL MANIPULATION problem with (cid:96) manipulators reduces to WEAK MANIPULATION, OPPORTUNISTIC MANIPULATION, and STRONG MANIPULATION problems with (cid:96) manipulators, since the former is a special case of the latter ones.
 The COALITIONAL MANIPULATION problem with (cid:96) manipulators many-to-one reduces to WEAK MANIPULATION, OPPORTUNISTIC MANIPULATION, and STRONG MANIPULATION problems with (cid:96) manipulators for all voting rules and for all positive integers (cid:96).
 We begin with proving that the WEAK MANIPULATION problem is NP-complete for the k-approval voting rule even with one manipulator and at most 4 undetermined pairs per vote.
 The other case where the manipulator s vote v(cid:48) be c (cid:31) d (cid:31) z2 (cid:31) z1 (cid:31) um (cid:31) (cid:31) u1 (cid:31) y can be argued similarly.
 For the Bucklin and simpli ed Bucklin voting rules, we show intractability of the OPPORTUNIS- TIC MANIPULATION problem with at most 15 undetermined pairs per vote and only one manipulator.
 The other case where the manipulator s vote v(cid:48) puts c, every candidate in W, x1, x2, and z2 within top m + 1 positions is symmetrical.
 For each candidate c(cid:48) C \ {c}, c(cid:48) can be placed at positions i {2, . . . , m} in the manipulator s vote which NM (c, c(cid:48)) + i 1 negative.
 Our next result proves that the STRONG MANIPULATION problem for the Bucklin, simpli ed Bucklin, Fallback, and simpli ed Fallback voting rules are in P.
 The STRONG MANIPULATION problem is in P for the Bucklin, simpli ed Bucklin, Fall- back, and simpli ed Fallback voting rules, for any number of manipulators.
