 We nd that causal statements have a number of signi cant lexical and grammatical differences compared with controls and tend to be more negative in sentiment than controls.
 The goal of this paper is to explore the language and topics of causal statements in a large corpus of social media taken from Twitter.
 The word cause was not included due to its use as a popular contraction for because .
 Each of the three cause-words , caused , causes , and causing appeared in 38.2%, 35.0%, and 26.8% of causal documents, respectively.
 Instead of considering individual documents, the distributions of labMT scores over all unigrams for each corpus was used to compare the corpora.
 In Fig. 1B we present odds ratios for how frequently unigrams (words), POS, or NE appear in causal documents rel- ative to control documents.
 The three unigrams most strongly skewed towards causal documents were stress , problems , and trouble , while the three most skewed towards control documents were photo , ready , and cute .
 The distributions in Fig. 3C account for 87.8% of scored text in the causal corpus and 77.2% of the control corpus.
 The words traf c and delays are the most probable words for this topic, and are common, low-impact occurrences.
 The problems topic shows people attribute their problems to many others with terms like: dont , people , they , them .
 Drama used the words: like , she , and her while documents in the sorry topic tended to address other people.
