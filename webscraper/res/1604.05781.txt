 We nd that causal statements have a number of signi cant lexical and grammatical differences compared with controls and tend to be more negative in sentiment than controls.
 The goal of this paper is to explore the language and topics of causal statements in a large corpus of social media taken from Twitter.
 Some post-processed and tagged example documents, both causal and control, are shown in Fig. 1A.
 We also applied sentiment analysis methods to these documents (Methods) and we have highlighted very positive and very negative words throughout Fig. 1.
 In Fig. 1B we present odds ratios for how frequently unigrams (words), POS, or NE appear in causal documents rel- ative to control documents.
 The three unigrams most strongly skewed towards causal documents were stress , problems , and trouble , while the three most skewed towards control documents were photo , ready , and cute .
 The medical topic also focused on negative words; highly probable words for this topic included cancer , break , dis- ease , blood , etc.
 Meanwhile, the body topic contained words like: stress , lose , and weight , giving a focus on on our more personal struggles with body image.
 Drama used the words: like , she , and her while documents in the sorry topic tended to address other people.
 The topics of causal documents discovered by LDA showed that both general and speci c statements are made regarding news, medicine, and relationships when individuals make causal attributions online.
