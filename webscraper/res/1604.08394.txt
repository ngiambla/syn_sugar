 A spatial and city-scale implementation would then con- sist in taking from the rich neighborhoods to give to the poor.
 Each transaction is time- stamped and contains the information collected by the bank on both the cardholder and the business.
 The rewiring methods we im- plemented operate directly at the level of individual transactions (see Figure S2 in Appendix).
 Decreasing spatial inequality in the city by adapting daily shopping destinations. (a) Decrease of wealth inequality among neighborhoods as a function of the fraction of transactions rewired, for various rewiring methods.
 The increase of spatial mixing is the consequence of in- dividual shopping trips more evenly distributed in the city space, required to homogenize the income among neighborhoods.
 More surprisingly, experiment (b) indicates that it is also not possible to simultaneously improve the wealth redistribution and the spatial mixing of indi- viduals.
 Relative error between the original users mobility indicators and the ones obtained after the rewiring according to the age. (a) Individual average distance traveled d. (b) Exploration rate . (c) Radius of gyration rg.
 The relative error is equal to the ratio of the di erence between rewiring and original values and the original value.
 The boxplot is composed of the rst decile, the lower hinge, the median, the upper hinge and the 9th decile.
 Relative error between the original number of transactions and visitors and the ones obtained after the rewiring for each business.
 The relative error is equal to the ratio of the di erence between rewiring and original values and the original value.
 The boxplot is composed of the rst decile, the lower hinge, the median, the upper hinge and the 9th decile. 17 Figure S10.
