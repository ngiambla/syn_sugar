 The growth of economic inequality has raised con- cern and attention in recent years [1, 2].
 In cities these inequalities are embedded in space, as a result of entangled processes which include location choices of households and businesses, daily mobility, segrega- tion and closure attitudes, central planning, or global economic restructuring.
 Finally, we are also interested in individual mobility routines and the tendency of individuals to return to already visited places.
 It is de ned as the num- ber of unique businesses he/she has visited divided by his/her total number of transactions, after k rewiring operations.
 Rewiring constraints the shopping trips network (k+ 1 rewiring operations) As mentioned above, a candidate recon guration of will occur if and only if the proposed change respects a number of constraints regarding the current con gura- tion (k rewiring operations) and the original shopping trips network.
 This study is a rst attempt to quantify the re- lation between shopping mobility and the spatial dis- tribution of economic activity in the city.
 The alter- native shopping trips resulting from our experiments o er an interesting trade-o between the preservation of essential aspects the e ective purchases of individ- uals and households, and their mobility properties and some reasonable changes in the places where they spend their money.
 Customers are identi ed with an anonymized customer ID, con- nected with sociodemographic characteristics (gender, age and occupation) and their postcode of residence.
 In the same way, businesses are identi ed through an anonymized business ID, a business category id, and the geographical coordinates of the credit card terminal.
 Since we are primarily interested in daily shopping mobility, we chose to consider the business categories that account for the top 90% of the daily shopping trips (see Figure S1).
