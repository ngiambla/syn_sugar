 Citizen Science platforms usually host multiple Citizen Science projects, and allow volunteers to choose the ones to participate in.
 Recent work in the area has demonstrated a positive feedback loop between participation and learning and creativity in Citizen Science projects, which is one of the motivating factors both for scientists and the volunteers.
 This emphasises the importance of creating successful Citizen Science plat- forms, which support this feedback process, and enable enhanced learning and creativity to occur through knowledge sharing and diverse participation.
 In this paper, we discuss how scientists and volunteers motivation and participation in uence the design of Citizen Science platforms.
 Recent work in the area has revealed a positive feedback loop between participation and learning and creativity in Citizen Science projects, which is one of the motivating factors both for scientists and the volunteers to participate in the Citizen Science projects interactively.
 This emphasises the importance of creating successful Citizen Science platforms, which support this feedback process, and enable enhanced learning and creativity to take place both for the scientists and the volunteers.
 The initial motivation de nes the Scientist s interest in creating a Citizen Science project or converting a science project to Citizen Science Project.
 Once they are motivated, they look for the avail- able support tools and techniques for creating and hosting the project online (Yadav and Darlington, 2016a).
 Wikipedia lists and displays many Citizen Science application and projects with their brief description along with project links. 6.
 CONCLUSIONS In this paper, we presented the design guidelines for user-inspired Citizen Science collaborative platforms by analysing the participation steps of scientists and volunteers in a Citizen Science project.
