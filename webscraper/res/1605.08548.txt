 In our work we develop, explore, and evaluate several innovative features designed around four usage scenarios: daily commuting, long-distance traveling, quanti ed traveling, and journaling.
 We present the results of two small-scale user studies, and one large-scale, world-wide deployment, synthesizing the results as potential opportunities and lessons learned in designing social comput- ing for non-places.
 Here users can review their history, add a new journey, and check-in to a previous journey. (Right) The Jour- ney screen.
 Once a user has checked-in to a journey, they can see stats about past visitors and interact with notes that others have left behind.
 INTRODUCTION The distinction between space and place has long provided an important theoretical framework for guiding the critical study and design of social computing systems, mobile location- based services, and online communities [20, 18].
 The main contributions of this work are: The design and implementation of Journeys & Notes, an Android app that lets people check-in to their journeys.
 Two 1-week-long user studies (6 people, and 15 people) of how people adopted the system, and how their use of the system impacted their perceptions of travel and non-places.
 Journey Check-ins The central experience of Journeys & Notes is the journey check-in, the process by which users expresses their presence on a particular journey.
 To check-in to a journey, a user must give their origin and destination (determining which journey they are on), and they must choose their mode of travel from a menu of travel icons (See Figure 5 Left).
 We also would have needed to embraced device noti cations as a mechanism to inform people when other activity happens near them, or on the posts that they leave behind, thus increas- ing interactions, and discoverability of people and content.
