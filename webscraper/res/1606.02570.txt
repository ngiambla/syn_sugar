 On the other hand, a good EGT model can provide explanations of the underlying dy- namics of an evolving system, and establish support for causal relationships.
 The normal-form game is symmetric, i.e., if we name the two individuals a and b, then it doesn t matter whether the one with strategy si is individual a or individual b.
 During the punishment phase, each individual has an opportunity to observe another individual s behavior, and decide whether to punish them.
 In Section 2.3 we discussed the question of why direct punishment should exist, since it incurs a cost to the punisher.
 In third-party punishment (3PP), an individual A harms another individual B, and an uninvolved third party C punishes A for causing that harm (see Figure 2(b)).
 Next, drawing on classic sociological and psychological theory, we hypothesized that social-structural constraints in human populations might play a crucial role in enabling the evolution of responsible 3PP.
 The constraints that particularly interested us were strength- of-ties and residential mobility, which have wide-ranging consequences for humans [20, 35, 34].
 We ran a large number of EGT simulations in which we varied the individuals average strength-of-ties and their average mobility.
 Furthermore, in their model, all of an agent s interactions were group-entitative, and we needed to introduce the possibility of individual-entitative behavior.
 The plots show the proportions of (a) the group-entitative and individual-entitative agents, and (b) the actions played by the agents.
 Thus, group-entitative strategies (in-group cooperation and out-group hostility) were pro table in terms of payo s and ethnocentric behavior be- came evolutionarily dominant.
