 CDR data have proven to be a hi- proxy for individuals movements and social interactions [22,37].
 Second, we apply the analytical framework on large- scale mobile phone data and quantify the relations be- tween human mobility, social interactions and economic development in France using municipality-level o cial statistics as external comparison measurements.
 Starting from mobile phone data (a) mobility and social measures are computed for each individual in the dataset (b).
 A set of recent works use mobile phone data as a proxy for socio-demographic variables.
 Unfortunately these socio-demographic data are generally not available in mobile phone data for privacy and proprietary reasons.
 We investigate the correlations between the aggre- gated measures and the external socio-economic indica- tors nding two main results.
 Figure 8 provides another way to observe the rela- tions between the diversity measures and socio-economic development.
 For mobility diversity, the deciles of the economic values increase while the mean de- creases and the variance increases, highlighting a change of the distribution in the di erent groups.
 For each group, we plot the distributions of mean mobility diversity and mean social diversity.
 In null model NM2, we randomly shu e the values of the socio-economic indicators over the municipali- ties.
 In contrast with empirical data, we nd no correlation in the null models between the diversity measures and the socio-economic indicators, neither for mobility diversity nor for social diversity (Figure 9).
 The interpretation of the observed relation between mobility diversity and socio-economic indicators is, with- out a doubt, two-directed.
