 In this paper, we design a data- driven analytical framework that uses mobility mea- sures and social measures extracted from mobile phone data to estimate indicators for socio-economic devel- opment and well-being.
 First, we design a data-driven analytical framework that uses Big Data to extract meaningful measures of human be- havior and estimate indicators for the socio-economic development.
 Figure 10 shows the relative im- portance of regressors produced by the LMG method [32] for both model M1 and model M2.
 We observe that mobility diversity gives the highest contribution to the regression, accounting for the 54% and 65% of the importance for M1 and M2 respectively, while so- cial diversity provides a little contribution (0.7% for M1 (a) (b) Fig. 8 The distribution of mobility diversity (a) and social diversity (b) in the deciles of deprivation index.
 We perform this procedure 100 times and take, for each municipality, the mean value of the socio-economic indicators computed over the 100 produced values.
 In contrast with empirical data, we nd no correlation in the null models between the diversity measures and the socio-economic indicators, neither for mobility diversity nor for social diversity (Figure 9).
 We are aware that the computation of individual measures on CDR data (step (a) and (b) in Figure 1) present privacy issues.
 We intend to use a method to assess the privacy risk of users in order to detect risk cases where the privacy of users is violated and apply privacy enhancing techniques for data anonymization [35].
 In our experiments we compare the measures of mo- bility and sociality with two external socio-economic in- dicators: per capita income and deprivation index.
 Per capita income is a simple indicator indicating the mean income of individuals resident in a given municipality, without any information about the distribution of the wealth and the inequality.
