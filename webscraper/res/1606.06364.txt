 These results highlight the potential for machine learning to have an impact on student retention and success while pointing to several promising directions for future work. 1.
 Our broader objective is to understand the key determinants of dropout, to accurately identify students likely to attrite, and to recommend policy interventions to reduce student attrition.
 In this workshop paper, we focus on results from our initial attempts to predict student dropout using demographic information as well as transcript records from the student s rst academic term at the university.
 We are also interested in understanding which elements in a student s data are the best predictors of dropout.
 For this, we run k separate logistic regressions of dropout on the kth feature, trained on the training set, and with performance calculated on the test data.
 Feature engi- neering is often used in the analysis of customer churn from businesses, as shown recently by Huang et al., for example (2015), and we see a direct analog with student attrition.
 We also intend to eventually look at convolutional and recurrent neural networks, thereby reducing the need for hand-engineered features. 5.
 Conclusions In this work, we show preliminary results for predicting student attrition from a large, heterogeneous dataset of student demographics and transcript records.
 Predicting eventual student attrition yielded promising results from a balanced dataset of over 32,500 students with regular- ized logistic regression providing the strongest predictions.
 GPA in math, English, chemistry, and psychology courses were among the strongest individual predictors of attrition, as were year of enrollment and birth year, thus highlighting time effects in our data.
