 Terminology Communication network: In this study, the social network of interest is a computer-mediated communication [Thurlow et al. 2004] network from Twitter.
 Relative status of two users can be de ned for both social and semantic capital and represents the difference of their respective status ranks.
 By testing for existence of status and value homophily, we con rm that these general theories from sociology hold in a communication social network.
 Such an abstraction provides us with social capital in terms of num- ber of contacts (unweighted) and total communication intensity (weighted network case).
 In line with such previous ndings, we ask on which semantic attributes our Twitter communication network ex- hibits assortativity and to what extent.
 Our rst set of ndings quantify to what extent semantic homophily and social in uence affect the communication, its propensity and intensity in online social networks, though we are not trying to distinguish between these two factors.
 Concretely, we analyze interplay of semantic relatedness and communication intensity and show that while their correlation is low, their relationship is strongly captured by subtle communication network properties.
 Next we show that several types of homophily are present in communication network, such as value (topics, sentiment) and status (social and semantic capital) homophily.
 Using temporal communication network we show that the tendencies of homophily and in uence are dynamic and change their role and magnitude in time.
 We analyze modular and overlapping community structure of the communication layer and nd evidence for Feld s theory about focused organization of social ties.
