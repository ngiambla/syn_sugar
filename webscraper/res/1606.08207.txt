 Namely, in addition to the mentioned assortativity coef cient, there are several other static and temporal network properties and substructures that can be linked to the tendencies of homophily and social in uence in the social network and we herein investigate those.
 Concretely, we tackle a computer-mediated communication network (based on Twitter mentions) and a particular type of assortative mixing that can be inferred from the semantic features of communication content that we term semantic homophily.
 Our work, to the best of our knowledge, is the rst to offer an in-depth analysis on semantic homophily in a communication network and the interplay between them.
 We quantify diverse levels of semantic homophily, identify the semantic aspects that are the drivers of observed homophily, show insights in its temporal evolution and nally, we present its intricate interplay with the communication network on Twitter.
 Relative status of two users can be de ned for both social and semantic capital and represents the difference of their respective status ranks.
 Finally, for a single user we de ne status inconsistency [Lenski 1954; Rogers and Bhowmik 1970] as a relative difference between his/her ranking among all users on social and semantic capital.
 The richest users in terms of both types of social capital tend to have an average semantic capital (between 500 and 1000).
 An additional way to investigate the interplay between social and semantic capitals is in terms of relative status of source and receiver in communication.
 Concretely, we analyze interplay of semantic relatedness and communication intensity and show that while their correlation is low, their relationship is strongly captured by subtle communication network properties.
 Next we show that several types of homophily are present in communication network, such as value (topics, sentiment) and status (social and semantic capital) homophily.
