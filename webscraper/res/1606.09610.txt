 What is the throughput (videos/week) that we can attain, and how many of these videos are mathematically correct? 2.
 What kinds of qualitative diversity e.g., presentation style, pegagogical approach, language style do the crowdsourced videos exhibit? 3.
 We presented one of the 18 problems mentioned above and asked them to create and upload a video explain- ing how to solve it. 5.
 Pedagogical style Over the 18 math problems for which tutorial videos were crowdsourced, we observed two general approaches Video 1 Video 2 Video 3 Video 4 Video 5 Figure 2.
 In this section, we explore whether the videos show any promise for actually helping students to learn.
 Histogram of the average learning gains Gk (av- erage posttest minus pretest score across all subjects who watched video k) for the 40 (k {1, . . . , 40}) crowdsourced videos.
 The black dashed line shows the average learning gains for the control video; the magenta line shows the average learning gains of all the crowdsourced videos.
 Results The histogram of the Gk for k {1, . . . , 40} is shown in Figure 4.
 The average learning gains (0.105) for the 40 crowdsourced videos was higher than for the control video (0.045); the di erence was statistically signi cant (t(39) = 3.715, p < 0.001, two-tailed).
 In fact, in terms of associated learning gains, the very best crowd- sourced videos were comparable and statistically in- distinguishable from a popular tutorial video on loga- rithms produced produced by Khan Academy.
 The content and format of the video are up to you, but the video must address the problem and must be mathematically correct.
 Please watch the videos carefully so you know what we are looking for in this HIT.
 The e ects of whiteboard animations on retention and subjective experiences when learning advanced physics topics.
