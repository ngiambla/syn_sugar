 However, little evidence exists about the sellers that are present on active carding forums, the precise types of products they advertise, and the prices buyers pay.
 We monitored ve out of 25 discovered forums, collected posts from the forums over a three-month period, and analysed them quantitatively and qualitatively.
 We focused our analyses on products, prices, seller proli cacy, seller specialisation, and seller reputation, and present a detailed discussion on our ndings.
 These studies mainly focus on the organisation and the structure of the forums but less on the content itself, that is, the products traded and the activity of the traders on these forums [3] [5].
 The emphasis on reputation and trust means that it is in- dispensable for competitive forums to have a well-functioning reputation system.
 Only very narrowly related categories, for instance credit card numbers and fullz, were treated as identical product categories in this respect.
 In terms of products, the top three sellers on Altenen sell CVVs and WU payments, on Crdpro they sell dumps and on Crimenetwork again CVVs.
 In total, the majority of the users on the forums are not specialised (see Table V), that is, most users sell more than one type of product and Hypothesis 3 has to be rejected.
 Hence, we made such a price comparison for US Classic CVVs, the (a) All forums. (b) Altenen forum.
