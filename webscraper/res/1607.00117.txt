 We monitored ve out of 25 discovered forums, collected posts from the forums over a three-month period, and analysed them quantitatively and qualitatively.
 In this paper, we established an outline of active forums and their de ning features.
 In those cases, entry costs are relatively high and access to higher tiers is tight [6].
 The emphasis on reputation and trust means that it is in- dispensable for competitive forums to have a well-functioning reputation system.
 We collected names of underground forums from various sources, and selected 5 forums that matched our selection criteria for examination.
 In summary, a consistent and thus comparable time period is favoured over a larger number of posts from small forums.
 For instance, if users sold credit card numbers and PayPal-credentials, we did not consider them as being specialised.
 Finally, in order to examine whether sellers operated on more than one forum (H6), we reproduced and interpreted the proportions of multiple representations across all forums.
 We carried out all these calculations both for the entirety of the threads and for each forum separately.
 This means that the trading sections of the forums are pro table distribution chan- nels for high-pro le actors.
