 Open Innovation and Triple Helix Models of Innovation: Can Synergy in Innovation Systems Be Measured?
 Journal of Open Innovations: Technology, Market and Complexity, 2(1) (2016) 1-12; doi:10.1186/s40852-016-0039-7 Loet Leydesdorff a * & Inga Ivanova b Abstract The model of Open Innovations (OI) can be compared with the Triple Helix of University- Industry-Government Relations (TH) as attempts to find surplus value in bringing industrial innovation closer to public R&D.
 Under specifiable conditions, feedback loops can be turned into feedforward ones that drive innovation eco- systems towards self-organization and the auto-catalytic generation of new options.
 The generation of options can be more important than historical realizations ( best practices ) for the longer-term viability of knowledge-based innovation systems.
 Increased redundancy not only stimulates innovation in an eco-system by reducing the prevailing uncertainty; it also enhances the synergy in and innovativeness of an innovation system.
 The two models OI and TH both depart from linear models such as technology push or demand pull in favor of a focus on interactions and further development.
 Measurement The TH functionalities can be specified more abstractly (as latent dimensions) than the observable institutions and their relations.
 In Germany, the generation of synergy is mainly at the level of the States (L nder) and not at the national level.
 In Italy, the main division is between the northern and southern parts of the country, and less so among regions as primarily administrative units.
 Each point in the Cartesian space of Figure 2 can be considered as representing a three- dimensional vector in terms of its x, y, and z-coordinates.
