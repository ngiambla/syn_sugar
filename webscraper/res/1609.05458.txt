 Very recently it was proved in [2] that intersecting r-Ryser hypergraphs exist also for every r = p + 2.
 For each parallel class Ci of Ap place a copy J i of J with one vertex class in Vi and the remaining r0 − 1 classes in Vp+2 . . .
 Extend every edge e of Ci to |J | edges e ∪ f of Hr by appending each edge f of J i to e.
 Thus the edge set of Hr is Sp+1 i=1 {e ∪ f : e ∈ Ci, f ∈ J i}.
 Hr is an r-partite r-uniform intersecting hypergraph, 3 2. τ (Hr) ≥ r − 1 − (d0 + 1).
 To see that Hr is intersecting, let e ∪ f and e′ ∪ f ′ be two edges of Hr.
 In this case T ∪ {x} is a cover of the aﬃne plane AG(2, p), which by Theorem 2 must have size at least 2p − 1.
 Hence |T | ≥ 2p − 2 ≥ p + r0 − 2 = r − 2 ≥ r − 1 − (d0 + 1).
 Since T is a minimum cover there exists an edge e ∪ f ′ of Hr such that T ∩ (e ∪ f ′) = {z}, where e ∈ Ci and f ′ ∈ J i.
 Since the J i are all disjoint we ﬁnd by the claim that |T | ≥ τ (J )(p+1) ≥ 2p + 2 > r − 1 − (d0 + 1).
 Let r = Pk i=1 pi + 1, where each pi is a prime power and pi ≥ Pj<i pj + 1 for each i ≥ 2.
 Assume k ≥ 2 and let Hs be a hypergraph with the claimed properties for s = r − pk.
 Then by the induction hypothesis τ (J ) ≥ s − (k − 1) = s − 1 − d0 where d0 = k − 2.
 Let w = p( t 4 ) − p( t 2, 3t 2, 3t 4 ] = 4 ].
 Therefore a good integer exists and we can write r − 1 = t = p1 + p2 + p3 where p1 < p2 and p3 ≥ t+1 2 ≥ 1 + p1 + p2.
 Note that if p, p − 1 are both prime powers then one of p, p−1 must be a power of 2.
 If p = 2i−1 +1 then r = 2i +1: since r − 1 is a prime power, there is already an extremal construction for this r.
 However, if p = 2i−1 and p − 1 is also prime, then we obtain a construction 6 for r = 2p − 1 = 2i − 1.
 To see that Gr is intersecting, let e ∪ f and e′ ∪ f ′ be two edges of Gr.
 Since T is a minimum cover there exists an edge e ∪ f ′ of Gr such that T ∩ (e ∪ f ′) = {z}, where e ∈ Ci and f ′ ∈ J i.
