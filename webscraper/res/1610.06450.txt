 The aim of this paper is to analyse urban accessibility considering its two components –the performance of the transport network and the attractiveness of the destinations– using a dynamic approach using data from TomTom and Twitter respectively.
 This allows us to obtain profiles that highlight the daily variations in accessibility in the city of Madrid, and identify the influence of congestion and the changes in location of the population.
 This enables a map to be created showing the distribution of Twitter users for each transport zone in the study area every 15 minutes, for use as a proxy for the attractiveness of each zone at each time of day.
 These data sources are used to make a dynamic study of accessibility, and analyse the influence of each accessibility component (network performance and the attractiveness of the destinations for activities) in each transport zone and at each time of day.
 So 𝐶𝑖𝑗𝑡 was calculated according to: 8 ∗ = 𝐶𝑖𝑗𝑡 1 2 + 𝐶𝑖𝑗𝑡 + 𝐶𝑖𝑖 1 2 𝐶𝑗𝑗 (2) To isolate the effect of each accessibility component (ease of access via the network and destination attractiveness) on dynamic accessibility, this indicator was calculated for each scenario described in subsection 4.2.
 The curve for the dynamic accessibility scenario is substantially higher than this average value in the early hours of the morning (between 7 and 7:30 am) and from 6:30 pm, revealing a higher than average accessibility in this time band.
 This means that the dynamic accessibility curve is almost always located between the curves for the dynamic congestion and attractiveness scenarios, although the fact that it is located closer to the first than the second indicates that the variation in congestion outweighs the variation in destination attractiveness.
 Unlike the general profile for the metropolitan area, the dynamic population distribution at the morning and evening peak times does not tend to offset the loss of accessibility due to congestion but instead reinforces it, as the city loses population during these periods owing to its residential character.
 However, it is significantly affected by congestion in the central hours of the day and particularly at the afternoon peak time, when the population begins to leave the centre to travel to the suburbs.
 In the residential area in the metropolitan south, the population dynamic is more stable than in the two previous zones, though the dynamic accessibility profile is more similar to that of the dynamic congestion scenario.
 To facilitate comparison between the dynamic scenarios and the reference scenario, the differences were calculated between the values in each scenario and the reference scenario and expressed in the form of ratios.
 At the morning peak time the discrepancies increase compared to the reference scenario (ratios of 1.09 and 1.03, respectively), producing a 9% and 3% higher coefficient of variation (variability between transport zones) in these dynamic scenarios than in the reference scenario.
 These data highlight the variation in the spatial distribution of the population depending on the time of day, and show that it tends to be concentrated in the centre in the morning and afternoon and in residential areas in the suburbs at night.
 At the morning peak time the greatest decrease in accessibility occurs in suburban residential zones, as the predominance of inbound travel causes serious problems of congestion, while the population tends to be concentrated in the centre.
 In contrast, at the afternoon peak time the transport zones in the centre and north, which contain the highest proportion of jobs, are the most negatively affected by the effects of congestion, at a time when outbound journeys predominate.
