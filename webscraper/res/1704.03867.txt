 In this research, we aimed to theoretically construct a model for IS security innovation adoption process in organisations, which includes organisational adoption process and the user acceptance of innovation.
 In the IS Security Innovation Adoption Model section, we discuss innovation adoption theories that are most relevant to IS security adoption.
 Amongst all of these models, DOI, TAM, TRA, TPB and TOE have been widely used in innovation adoption research [30].
 Consistent with extant research on IS security, we developed the IS Security adoption model by replicating the theories of IS innovation adoption.
 Lee and Kozar [36] found that user acceptance attributes of attitude, social influence and PBC significantly influence anti-spyware systems adoption.
 Lee and Kozar [37] examined anti-spyware software adoption and found that user acceptance attributes of attitude, subjective norm and self-efficacy are important determinants.
 Conclusions and Future Research Effective adoption of IS security innovation is critical in protecting organisation s IS assets from malicious attacks.
 In this study, we developed and proposed a model for the process of IS security innovation adoption in organisations.
 The study integrated perspectives from DOI, TAM, TPB and TOE to depict IS security innovation adoption process in organisations.
 Equally, the study provides researchers and practitioners with a set of factors that affect the adoption of IS security in organisations.
 It draws upon and merged from the rich literature in IS innovation adoption theories and applies it in the context of IS security where, it has seldom been examined.
 To overcome the shortcomings of individual IS innovation adoption models such as the DOI and TAM; the proposed model combined a number of innovation adoption models.
 Combining different innovation adoption models allows the individual model to complement each other, strengthening the analytical ability of the proposed model.
 Another important contribution of this research is that the proposed IS security model considers both the organisational adoption process and the user acceptance of innovation in a single illustration.
 Incorporating the organisational adoption process and the user acceptance of innovation in a single representation allows to explain IS security innovation adoption process more thoroughly.
