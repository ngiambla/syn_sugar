 Research Agenda in Intelligent Infrastructure to Enhance Disaster Management, Community Resilience and Public Safety Michael Dunaway University of Louisiana at Lafayette Robin Murphy Texas A&M University Nalini Venkatasubramanian University of California Irvine Leysia Palen University of Colorado at Boulder Daniel Lopresti Lehigh University Challenge and Opportunity Modern societies can be understood as the intersection of four interdependent systems: (1) the natural environment of geography, climate and weather; (2) the built environment of cities, engineered systems, and physical infrastructure; (3) the social environment of human populations, communities and socio-economic activities; and (4) an information ecosystem that overlays the other three domains and provides the means for understanding, interacting with, and managing the relationships between the natural, built, and human environments.
 The design and integration of intelligent infrastructure—including embedded sensors, the Internet of Things (IoT), advanced wireless information technologies, real-time data capture and analysis, and machine-learning-based decision support—holds the potential to greatly enhance public safety, emergency management, disaster recovery, and overall community resilience, while addressing new and emerging threats to public safety and security.
 Two notable examples include the FEMA "whole of community" approach to emergency management that combines a formal Incident Command System with data visualization and decision systems, and establishes a National Disaster Recovery Framework targeting community recovery—and not simply emergency response—as the objective of disaster preparedness; and the Department of Justice "Community Policing" initiative that combines technology enabled police forces, integrated security systems and data analytics with education, engagement, and empowerment of the civil population.
 Similar initiatives in collaborative research and development of intelligent infrastructure and technologies are represented by programs like the NIST and National Science Foundation Smart & Connected Communities programs that emphasize joint efforts involving research universities and laboratories, commercial entities and technology developers, end-users such as first responder groups and local government agencies, aligned with federal funding agencies and non-profits.
 The success of this endeavor will depend on continuing partnerships among university research centers, federal laboratories, private sector research and development, and support of federal funding agencies. 1 Mynatt et al. (2017) “A National Research Agenda for Intelligent Infrastructure” CCC Led Whitepapers http://cra.org/ccc/resources/ccc-led-whitepapers/, last accessed April 12, 2017. 1 Benefits The nation currently faces both a strategic challenge and an opportunity brought about by the intersection of three major trends: (1) increasing technological sophistication of urban centers and the connectedness of both physical and social systems; (2) dramatic changes in hazards and risks at national, regional and local levels, to include the enduring threat of mass-casualty terrorism, and the increasing frequency of severe weather events and impact on communities and populations; and (3) the need for substantial revitalization of the nation's critical infrastructure systems, to include enhanced abilities to detect, prevent and mitigate cyber-security threats to critical high-reliability systems.
 Priority should be placed on the following areas in intelligent infrastructure: Sensing, and Data Collection o Sensing research (particularly computer vision) to advance capabilities in environmental monitoring and interpretation of imagery from mobile perceptive devices (e.g., unmanned aerial, ground, or marine systems, smart phones, etc.) and associated video feeds from social media networks. o Methods to enable resilient integration, operation, and security of next generation IoT devices and o Coordination of air and ground assets for information gathering, and command and control of deployed technologies, combining in-situ and mobile sensing deployed in the field. responders and organizations engaged in active intervention in disaster scenarios.
 Communication and Coordination o Seamless multi-network provisioning utilizing any and all existing wired and wireless infrastructures, new long-range wireless technologies, 5G, and public safety networks cooperatively managed for reliable exchange of crisis-related information. o Design of sense-analyze-respond systems to enhance first responder and agency situational awareness and support near real-time decision making. 2 o o Impact of system degradation and failures within interdependent infrastructures to develop analytics for response processes within closely coupled systems and avert cascading casualties.
 Integration and coordination of multi-team systems, i.e., multi-disciplinary teams of first responder groups including firefighters, law enforcement, emergency medical, search and rescue, and emergency management that must share a common operating picture and coordinate operations across geography in dynamic, high- stress environments. o Research into Software Defined Networks for emergency management communications to establish and manage priority among disaster-related data transmitted via both standard wireless carriers and gigabit- capacity networks that may become degraded or overloaded (particularly with streaming video) during emergency conditions. appropriate and adaptive response, and to refine response planning.
 Big Data Modeling frameworks, Analytics and Tools for Disaster Prediction and Management o Probabilistic modeling of complex events to develop predictive analytics and enhance the capabilities for o Multilevel, multiscale modeling methods for understanding factors that contribute to or undermine community resilience, and permits the capture and visualization of data elements reflecting different aspects of a community, from physical geography to built infrastructure to activities, entities, events, and processes on the infrastructure, and the impact on overall community resilience metrics.
 Such multiscale modeling techniques would be designed to capture entities and events in the framework at different levels of abstraction. o Research into protocols and methods for ensuring both reliability and privacy of data collection and analytics during emergency situations, disasters, and crises. o o Social Computing, Human Factors, and the Information Infrastructure o Advanced information infrastructure that integrates information technologies with new analytic approaches to yield new data for new situations, applications and communities.
 In these dynamic situations, the data produced through social media by people affected by disasters are hyper-localized and hyper-temporalized, as are the answers and assistance sought by affected populations. o Development of algorithms for anticipatory information management based on social media queries and data o Methods for reliably incorporating human input via social media and other sources to augment situational o Natural interfaces and tools that enhance human capabilities to ask questions in a high-level manner that awareness with citizen perspectives of ground truth during incidents. requests originating from disaster affected populations; o facilitate making decisions during extreme events.
