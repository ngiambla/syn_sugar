 An algorithm that uses accelerometer data to provide a control and communication signal is described.
 The objective of this paper is to explore the usage of wearable devices for activity recognition by using wireless communication channel where the transmission of signal through body area network uses half duplex communication with the help of a wearable device wireless communication.
 The activity recognition shall be explained by using a single wearable device accelerometer sensor data to understand wireless communication mechanism of a single wearable device.
 The wireless communication system for a wearable device is illustrated by establishing an intra body network to transmit information to proximate devices.
 Figure 1 explains the hardware design of an Intra Body Communication System.
 It is then modulated to turn into transmission signal for communication for Intra Body.
 The system is implemented on FPGA with a size of wrist watch sized devices.

 The data acquired from 3-axis accelerometer sensor can be exploited to govern the electrical appliances in a home.
 The Chronos module communicates to PC through a RF USB debugging interface/ CC1111 RF USB access point.
 The wireless communication outline is illustrated in the following diagram: Figure 5.
 For other movements apartment from horizontal and vertical, there is no activity (DO NOTHING) in the room.
 The algorithm to activate the watch is developed using Matlab and the completed data processing takes place within Matlab.
 Applications There ae several applications in several fields for wireless communication using wearable devices.
 Wearable devices can also be used in biometric applications that are completely dependent on the human body.
