 First the system can iden- tify the degree of dietary style mixture of any selected recipe.
 Third, the system can suggest ingredient substitutions through an extended word2vec model, such that a recipe becomes more authentic for any selected dietary style.
 For example, the Japanese dietary style as measured in the 1970s is reported to have been healthy [3].
 However, recipes in such a Japanese style may not be readily acceptable for those that prefer Southern American dietary style.
 The aim of this study is to propose a novel data-driven system for transformation of dietary style.
 Second, the system visualizes a recipe’s dietary style mixture in two-dimensional space under barycentric coordinates using what we call a Newton diagram.
 Third, the system transforms a recipe’s dietary pattern into any selected regional style by recommending replaceable ingredients in existing recipes.
 When we enter a recipe, this model classiﬁes which country or regional cuisine the recipe belongs to.
 However, in this era, it is becoming diﬃcult to identify a recipe’s dietary style with speciﬁc country/regional style.
 First of all, our identiﬁcation and transformation algorithms depend on the quantity and quality of recipes included in the data.
 For example, the deﬁnition of Mediterranean dietary pattern has been revised to adapt to current dietary patterns [17, 18].
 Therefore, future research should employ time-trend recipe data to distinctively specify a recipe’s mixture of dietary style and its date cf. [19].
 Third, we did not consider the cooking method (e.g., baking, boiling, and deep ﬂying) as a characteristic of country/regional style.
 As such, if we analyze the recipes data using ﬂavor compounds, we might get diﬀerent results.
 In conclusion, we proposed a novel system which can transform a given recipe into any selected dietary style.
