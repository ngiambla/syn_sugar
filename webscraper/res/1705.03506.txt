 In this paper we describe a simulation platform that supports studies on the impact of crime on urban mobility.
 In the first moment, based on the real world data on the track of users, we evaluate the system when the users make their actual routes.
 A user's route on a bus network is defined by bus stops visited in sequence by that user within one or more buses.
 Furtado et al [37] estimated these routes from the actual origin of each user to the actual destination, see [31] for details.
 For each origin and destination, two routes were estimated; one that the authors consider to be the actual route of the user and the other is an optimal route in time.
 Also from [37], a network of time was obtained, where the nodes represent bus stops and the links the average time between these two bus stops. them.
 Whenever a bus arrives at a stop, it is checked if there are passengers intending to disembark or board the vehicle.
 The behavior of the network in its natural operation was observed, i.e. when all users make their actual route.
 Figure 2 (A) shows the stocking of vehicles when all users make actual routes, while in Figure 2 (B) the vehicles are stocked for the optimal routes.
 In Figure 2 (D) it is possible to visualize the crime rate per stop at optimal and real ballooning points.
 In Fig. 3 we show the relation between crimes and the urban public transportation network.
 The power law distribution indicates that we can find bus stops with much large number of crimes when we compare with an exponential distribution.
 This can be understood as an indication that the users of the transport system privilege the security factor.
