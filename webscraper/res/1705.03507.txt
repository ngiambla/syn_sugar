 The work is devoted to a modern state, methods and tools of monitoring, assessment and prediction of the indicators showing physical condition of a person and his/her capabilities to perform work duties.
 The analysis showing significant interconnections and factors that determine a necessary level of working capacity and productivity of personnel allows organizing Work & Rest Schedule of employees in an effective manner.
 Introduction Apart from current programs devoted to the near and deep space exploration, space agencies of different countries also perform advance research with a longer time lag.
 The objective of the work is to perform an analysis of existing gadgets, applications and technologies that help people to track their health state.
 The number of patients that have one or several chronic diseases and who require remote monitoring services constitutes 200 mln people only in Western Europe and the USA [1].
 Remote monitoring devices targeted at the patients with an irregular heartbeat, diabetes and chronic lung diseases are going to be in a maximum demand.
 Such devices shall release medical staff from standard and scheduled examinations, allowing them to allocate their time for those patients who are acutely in need of medical help.
 Therefore, the tasks of monitoring and forecasting of the personnel health deem very important for the purpose of maintaining the significant indicators at levels not lower than the acceptable ones.
 It can provide a prognosis of the indicator's value for some moment in the future and to prevent, possibly, its transfer to the critical range.
 The heartbeat recovery process can be usually presented as an exponential relationship of the following type: 𝑓(𝑡) = 𝑎 + (𝑑 − 𝑎)𝑒−𝜃𝑡 + 𝜀, (1) where 𝑎 is a normal value of the heartbeat; 𝑑 is the heartbeat's value right after the exercises; 𝜃 is a speed coefficient of the heartbeat's recovery; 𝜀 is a random component of the changes.
 According to current values of a heartbeat's target indicator 𝑓(𝑡) it is possible to compute the value of 𝜃 coefficient, using, for example, a least square method and specialized or standard software.

 Conclusions Taking into consideration the analysis presented in the work, it is possible, for example, to apply the technology of monitoring, analysis and health management of a group of people in a certain professional sphere, in particular in longterm space expeditions. 1.
 While operating at a real data field of a subject domain under consideration, it is necessary to discover the most significant biomarkers, predictors and their most effective complexes. to examine 3.
 In order to provide a maximum accuracy of assessment and forecasting, the dependencies of significant biomarkers and/or predictors (including the complex ones) from the factors of external and internal environment that have a significant impact upon their prognostic qualities. 4.
