 The limited bandwidth of wireless link and energy constrained nodes in dynamic network topology of MANET makes routing strategies more complex [1].
 The primary objective of classical multipath routing is to discover multiple paths between source and destination to countenance load balancing among several nodes, attenuate network traffic and aggregate network bandwidth in order to ameliorate the quality of services (QoS) [2].
 In this context we have proposed a multipath routing strategy having trait in selection of neighbor nodes based on link stability in order to upshot the MANET performance in the context of load balancing and data transmission.
 In [3] a multipath routing strategy is proposed based on link stability and energy consumption to improve the network performance.
 Chaki have proposed a restricted multi-path routing algorithm that can dynamically selects the number of neighboring nodes for transmitting packet from source node to sink node [6].
 PROPOSED ROUTING MODEL ASSUMTION The most changeable aspect of MANET is mobility of nodes that emphasis on dynamic routing decision.
 Let nodes n1 and n2 have speed v1 and v2 along the directions θ1 and θ2 respectively.
 PROPOSED ROUTING METHODOLOGY On demand multipath routing strategy has three phases viz. route discovery, route establishment, route maintenance.
 The algorithm for our proposed routing scheme is excogitated as follows: link expiration AMR () Input: Considered network, Source, Destination 1.
 If (row.source = sourceNode && row.destination = destinationNode && row.timestamp ≤ timestamp) 3.1 Path_id = Path_id {row.id} 3.2 Increment existRoute by one 4.
 End Route_Establish () Input: Set neighbor Nodes for each of the nodes from source to destination nodes 1.
 Residual Energy of All Nodes along with speed and moving direction // RREQ includes source node, next node, partial path, Partial_path_stabiliy.
 As shown in Fig. 1, there are three feasible paths from source node „A‟ to destination node „K‟.

 Using our proposed routing method, a node is selected based upon its‟ current energy and corresponding link expiration time.
