 Wireless sensor networks are of different types and they are used on the basis of physical conditions, environment and conditions.
 Terrestrial wireless sensor networks are consisting of numerous sensor nodes which are deployed in a specific area for a specific purpose.
 Mobile wireless sensor networks are used for monitoring the movements or locations of body in a physical environment.
 Some important parameters which can be used to evaluate the performance of the wireless sensor networks are also presented in this work.
 Introduction Wireless sensor networks consist of different sensor nodes that work collectively for a specific task.
 Initially Wireless sensor networks were only used for the military purposes for different purposes like monitoring and defense purpose.
 In the recent years, Wireless sensor networks have progress a lot in the field of healthcare.
 Patient monitoring automated medicine alert and diagnose of different disease and their procurement and many more [1].
 Special kind of sensor nodes are used which can regulate the insulin doze and it can calculate automatically the glucose rate inside the blood.
 In wired sensor networks a hectic situation is created due to wires and it creates complications, and hence patient is restricted.
