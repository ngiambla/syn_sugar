 From personalized models we can predict health status using perpetual sensing and data streams.
 Given these predictions we give precise recommendations to best suit the prediction for that individual.
 A lack of individual contextual analysis results in compromised care and sub-optimal outcomes.
 RELATED WORK Clinical and medical research in personalized and preventive medicine struggles to gain traction.
 Computing work in this ﬁeld has primarily focused on giving the user ﬁgures and statistics of past data.
 This is true for both hardware and software in personal health.
 Hardware such as the Fitbit, and health software like Apple’s HealthKit only function to acquire and accumulate data.
 Most importantly current digital health mechanisms are rudimentary in detecting context for each individual.
 Cybernetic systems apply in all time scales of health from acute to chronic diseases.
 Life activity events for health computation are parallel to objects in a picture for intelligent visual computing.
 These models estimate and predict how future events will affect the habits waveform and variables of interest.
 The incentives also need to be aligned for the patient to take positive actions [28].
 The upper right quadrant of Ability represents options that are both healthy and preferred for a given user.
 HB tilts the Ability to optimize for convenience, preferences and health factors in real-time. 3.
 Investigating the viability of automated, intuitive, and contextual insights for chronic disease self-management using ubiquitous computing technologies.
