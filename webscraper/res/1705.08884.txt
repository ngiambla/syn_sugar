 Results depict a dramatic picture: 65 % of websites do not respect the Directive and install tracking cookies before the user is even oﬀered the accept button.
 Results are discouraging: The large ma- jority (65%) of European websites violates the ePrivacy Directive, with some categories (e.g., “News and Media”) where violations top to 92%.
 The Directive has been criticized as a case of regulatory failure: it impairs user browsing experience, and it is ineﬀective in increasing the awareness about online tracking [17, 20, 24, 12].
 We strongly believe our results can be useful for both researchers and poli- cymakers in the debate on how to regulate and enforce privacy policies on the web. 2 Background In this section we ﬁrst describe the cookie technology in the context of online tracking.
 In the last version, it explicitly disciplines the use of any tracking “devices” (e.g., cookies, supercookies, ﬁngerprinting, etc.), and it is based on the “explicit consent” principle.
 Opinion 04/2012 [11] explicitly considers cookies, and clariﬁes which kinds are exempted from the requirement of explicit consent: session cookies, and cookies that are essential to provide the service are exempted (e.g., to handle a cart in an e-commerce website).
 At the end of this process, we tag web pages violating the ePrivacy Directive as those installing at least one proﬁling cookie, i.e., (i) related to a web-tracking service, and (ii) persistent.
 Our approach is conservative as it builds on sub- set of well-known tracking services, and does not include, e.g., advertisements 1The Set-Cookie header contains the cookie the server generates to install on the browser. 4 platforms, CDNs, etc.
 To perform these campaigns, we proﬁt from a Linux machine equipped with an Intel R(cid:13) Xeon CPU with 12 cores and 32GB RAM and connected to the Internet through a 1Gb/s network.
 Hence, we build a custom web measurement tool, namely CookieCheck, based on Google Chrome; its code can be downloaded at [2], and a working demonstrator of the tool is available online [1].
 All other websites, i.e., 80.5% install proﬁling cookies before consent, and possibly install more after that. 5.4 Impact of device and location We study Browser-DS dataset to check whether installed proﬁling cookies vary when using diﬀerent browsers, devices, or changing country where the client is located.

 Indeed, iv) It is cumbersome for webmasters to fully support the Directive. it is hard to control the activity of third parties, especially in the complicated ecosystem of advertisement and tracking platforms.
 We hope the eﬀort in producing tools for auditing privacy violations will increase and get momentum. 12 References [1] CookieCheck online tool. https://goo.gl/spfjOn.
