 The main contribution of our team consists in design and implementation of a RFID based integrated system with a high degree of generalization. 2 RFID: concepts and benefits RFID (Radio Frequency IDentification) is a technology used for the automatic identification of objects and people.
 The reading range varies in accordance with the size of the reader antenna, the orientation of the RFID tag towards the antenna, the tag position with respect to the antenna core, as well as with the tag type.
 The major advantages are that RFID has the capacity to store larger amount of information, gathers the information faster than barcodes and the read/write operations can be performed through different materials such us paper, plastic or wood, with the exception of metals.

 Moreover, if one gets near the products holding a mobile reading system; the handheld device will immediately collect and store data; product management is improved, thanks to the re-programmable memory which also allows instant product location; customer services are considerably improved; RFID will allow receiving authorities to verify the security and authentication of shipped items. 3 Presentation of the system General presentation 3.1 The RFID-based integrated system presents a high degree of generality and may be used for the identification and traceability of physical entities in space and time.
 Thus, the user can define the data format to be used for writing data into tags through an advanced template editor which allows user to establish necessary fields (e.g. acquisition date, location, current value) and their type (character, string, integer, real). 3.2 System architecture The architecture of the systems is presented in Figure 1.
 This informatics system must perform the following tasks: o o o to communicate with fix and mobile readers in order to retrieve data and/or transmit data to be written to allow users to select the information to be introduced to maintain and update a local data base that might be used for further processing.
 For instance, the stored data in the database can be used in complex processing activities (estimations, statistics, etc), depending on necessities. - - an RFID system connected to the PC, which allows the reading/writing of transponders; fix readers, formed by PSD based stations to which readers have been connected.
 If a great number of stations is required, a network master for maximum 30 stations will be used; this network master allows PC communication through wire or radio; - mobile readers that comprise a connected reader to a PDA.

 These operations are performed both on the PC and the PDA; - management of system registered users (users visualization, adding or deletion of certain users, profile modification, etc.); - enabling the management of the database, which stores information related to transponders, station control, events derived from system stations, users and events; - the configuration of the integrated system in accordance with necessities, including the configuration of:   the applications running on the PC, with the setting of the folder holding the application database, the station communication rate, displaying color (Figure 2); the working stations, allowing, for instance, the setting of the communication rate, station address, password, etc.;  PDA application, with the setting of application data basis folder. - warning/alarming overrun expected/special situations, in accordance with the settings; - creating the models to be used for transponder information storage (Figure 3); - administration of databases with information on transponders, stations, etc.; - enabling the communication with system customers, and allowing the connection with higher enterprise levels; - the storage of all events and their administration (visualization, searching, filtering etc. – Figure 4, 5); Figure 2.
 Displaying of PDA events journal - the visualization and processing of interesting information; - the defining of some report patterns in accordance with the user’s options and the simple generation of reports, with the possibility of their visualization and printing, (Figure 6) Figure 6.
 This library ensures: - - - the establishment of the PC-PDA connection; the server application will ensure the connection to the PDA; the PC-PDA connection interruption; the PC-PDA connection state ascertainment; the processing operations on files/folders: copying of a certain file from the PDA to the PC, copying of a certain file from the PC to the PDA, deletion of a certain file from the PDA, creating a new folder on the PDA, deletion a folder from the PDA, creating a new folder on the PDA, deletion of a folder from the PDA, retrieving information about a file/folder, copying a Microsoft Access database (.MDB) from the PC to the PDA and the conversion to Pocket Access format (.CDB) and vice versa, copying of certain tables from a Microsoft Access database (.MDB) from the PC to the PDA and adding them to a Pocket Access database (.CDB) and vice versa. 4 Potential beneficiaries The potential beneficiaries of this system are companies that activate in fields that lend themselves admirably to RFID technologies: - - - supermarkets, stores, bookshops, pharmacies etc – where the entities are the products on sale; these products will no longer carry barcodes. airports – where the monitored entities are the passengers’ luggage; libraries – where transponders will facilitate the traceability of both library books and registered readers; - manufacturing companies – where the entities range from semi-finished goods and subsets to end products; a traceability systems will allow the perfect management of all sets and subsets. various enterprises wishing to keep their stock in sight and to make fast inventories. - integrated system based on RFID Conclusions RFID is sometimes named a revolution for the identification and traceability of products and subsets in an enterprise.
