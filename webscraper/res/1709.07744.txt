 Distributed Compressed Sensing DCS [24] assumes a joint sparsity model to describe the spatiotemporal dependencies among ζ homogeneous signals.

 Speciﬁcally, consider a network of n nodes and let xi ∈ R denote a scalar reading of node i ∈ {1, 2, . . . , n}.
 As shown in Fig. 1, node 1 generates a pseudorandom number φj,1 — using its network address as the seed of a pseudorandom number generator — and transmits the value φj,1x1 to node 2.
 Subsequently, node 2 generates same node, different sensor Pollutants (sources) Node id: : Sink 4 Rademacher matrix [21], and ΨT is the transpose of Ψ.
 Let S(l) denote the random vari- able associated with the reading of source l ∈ {1, . . . , (cid:96)}, and let s(l) be one of its realizations.
 The vectors of Fig. 3. readings x(l) of each data type are reconstructed sequentially, l = 1, . . . , (cid:96).
 Let x(l) i 1 , . . . , x(l) (cid:0)x(l) where s(l) = (cid:0)s(l) i , . . . , x(l) n (cid:1) be the vector collecting all the read- (cid:1) is the compressible , . . . , s(l) n ings of data type l.
 Unlike the studies in [18], [26], [27], the sensing matrix we consider here is Φ(l) = Θ(l)ΨT , where Θ(l) is a sparse Sink ///! does not factor into the product of its marginals.
 In turn, the expression for the Student’s t-copula uses a standard multivariate t- distribution, parameterized by the correlation matrix Rt and by the degrees of freedom ν.
 The diagonal entries of the correlation matrices R(·) are 1, and the non-diagonal are equal to the estimated Spearman’s ρ values.
 The most popular explicit copulas are the Archimedean, which are parameterized by a single parameter ξ ∈ Ξ ⊆ R.
 A factor graph represents the factorization of an expression by using two types of nodes: variable nodes and factor nodes.
 We represent a message from variable s(l) i ), and a i message from factor fZ to variable s(l) i ).
 The i messages are updated as follows:3 rλ−1 U→i 1 ∈ (4, +∞)}(cid:17) 1 ∈ (−∞,−4)}, . . . , P{S(l) to factor fZ at iteration λ as qλ (cid:16)P{S(l) denotes the sum over all variables but s(l) i , and a “product” between messages is the pointwise product between the respective vectors.

 The length of each uniform random vector is n = 1000 and the copulas are parameterized by ξC and ξF , respectively.
 Reconstruction performance of CO signals using as side information (a) only signals of NO2, and (b) both signals of NO2 and SO2.
 In particular, the aggregated average relative error increases on average 5.8% (σz = 2) and 18.7% (σz = 5) with respect to the noiseless case.
 The energy consumption at each node is broken down into a sensing, processing and transmission part: Etotal = Esens. + Eproc. + ETx [63].
