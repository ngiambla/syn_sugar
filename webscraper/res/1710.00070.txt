 For p ∈ kω and σ ∈ k<ω, we EFFECTIVENESS FOR THE DUAL RAMSEY THEOREM 5 write σ ≺ p if σ is an initial segment of p.
 Let σ ∈ (ω)k τ ∈ (ω)s+1 ﬁn and |σ| = s + 1 > µσ(k − 1), we have σ ◦ τ ∈ (ω)k preceding Lemma 2.3.
 Because ﬁn by the comments ﬁn with |σ| = s + 1 by σ(i) = τ ′(µτ (i)) for all i < s + 1.
 In this case, we say p ∈ (ω)k is in V (and write p ∈ V ) if for all pairs hn, σi ∈ V , p 6∈ [σ].
 By Lemma 2.3, let ∪i<ℓbOi = (ω)k be an open coloring such that for any q ∈ (ω)ω, (q)k ⊆ bOi if and only if (q ◦ y)k ⊆ Oi.
 It is straightforward to check that the coloring (ω)k = ∪i<ℓbOi is also reduced. that hn, τ i ∈ bOi and σa(k − 1) (cid:22) τ .
 Because (ω)k = ∪i<ℓbOi, there is a color i < ℓ and a pair hn, τ i ∈ bOi such that τ ≺ p.
 To build y ∈ (ω)ω, we construct a sequence τk−1 ≺ τk ≺ · · · of strings τs ∈ (ω)s ﬁn in stages starting with τk−1 for notational convenience and set y = ∪s≥k−1τs.
 For n ≥ |τ j s |, let τ j+1 (n) = τ j s < ℓ. s ◦τ j s s s (δj s s s Claim.
 Let y ∈ (ω)ω and (y)k = ∪i<ℓCi be an m-reduced coloring for some 1 < m < k. therefore we can apply CSL(m, ℓ) to it.
 Let 1 < m < k, y ∈ (ω)ω and (y)k = ∪i<ℓCi be an m-reduced We deﬁne the induced coloring (y)m+1 = ∪i<ℓbCi as follows.
 If there is an n ≥ 1 such that [0n] ∩ R = ∅, then the partition x ∈ (ω)ω with blocks {0, 1, . . . , n}, {n + 1}, {n + 2}, . . . satisﬁes (x)2 ⊆ R.
 We deﬁne a sequence of strings τ 0 s , . . . , τ Ms s all σ ∈ (ω)2 σ ∈ (ω)2 set τs+1 = τ Ms .
 For n = 0, we have X ∈ A ⇔ ∃k ∃m P (m, X ↾ k) where P (x, y) is a Π0 0 predicate.
 Fix R and ﬁx a Π0 n+1 predicate P (k, y) such that for y ∈ (ω)2, y ∈ R ⇔ ∃k P (k, y).
 For σ ∈ B with |σ| = k, βk(σ, B, ℓ, p) says that p is in the set coded by the labeled subtree of (B, ℓ) above σ.
 Consider the following sequence of 1 set (if ℓ(σ) = ∪) or a Π0 • To form (B1, ℓ1), for each σ ∈ B with |σ| = 1 and ℓ(σ) = ∪, remove the subtree of B above σ (including σ).
 Without loss of generality, R0 and R1 are in normal form. 0 = ω − {k} and Bpk 2 is implied by Dn n-rDRT2 1 = {k}.
 For m < n, we let Ri(t0, . . . , tm) denote the Borel set coded by the subtree of Ri above ht0, . . . , tmi.
 If m < n − 1, then Ri(t0, . . . , tm) is a code for a Σ0 n−(m+1) set (if m is odd) or a Π0 n−(m+1) set (if m is even) in normal form.
