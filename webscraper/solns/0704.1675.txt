  information integration applications, such as mediators or mashups, that
require access to information resources currently rely on users manually
discovering and integrating them in the application. manual resource discovery
is a slow process, requiring the user to sift through results obtained via
keyword-based search. although search methods have advanced to include evidence
from document contents, its metadata and the contents and link structure of the
referring pages, they still do not adequately cover information sources --
often called ``the hidden web''-- that dynamically generate documents in
response to a query. the recently popular social bookmarking sites, which allow
users to annotate and share metadata about various information sources, provide
rich evidence for resource discovery. in this paper, we describe a
probabilistic model of the user annotation process in a social bookmarking
system del.icio.us. we then use the model to automatically find resources
relevant to a particular information domain. our experimental results on data
obtained from \emph{del.icio.us} show this approach as a promising method for
helping automate the resource discovery task.
