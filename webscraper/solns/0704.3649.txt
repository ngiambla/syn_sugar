this paper proposes a method to address the longstanding problem of lack ofmonotonicity in estimation of conditional and structural quantile functions,also known as the quantile crossing problem. the method consists in sorting ormonotone rearranging the original estimated non-monotone curve into a monotonerearranged curve. we show that the rearranged curve is closer to the truequantile curve in finite samples than the original curve, establish afunctional delta method for rearrangement-related operators, and derivefunctional limit theory for the entire rearranged curve and its functionals. wealso establish validity of the bootstrap for estimating the limit law of thethe entire rearranged curve and its functionals. our limit results are genericin that they apply to every estimator of a monotone econometric function,provided that the estimator satisfies a functional central limit theorem andthe function satisfies some smoothness conditions. consequently, our resultsapply to estimation of other econometric functions with monotonicityrestrictions, such as demand, production, distribution, and structuraldistribution functions. we illustrate the results with an application toestimation of structural quantile functions using data on vietnam veteranstatus and earnings.
