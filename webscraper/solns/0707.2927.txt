for any finite graph gamma and any field k of characteristic unequal to 2 weconstruct an algebraic variety x over k whose k-points parameterise k-liealgebras generated by extremal elements, corresponding to the vertices of thegraph, with prescribed commutation relations, corresponding to the non-edges.after that, we study the case where gamma is a connected, simply laced dynkindiagram of finite or affine type. we prove that x is then an affine space, andthat all points in an open dense subset of x parameterise lie algebrasisomorphic to a single fixed lie algebra. if gamma is of affine type, then thisfixed lie algebra is the split finite-dimensional simple lie algebracorresponding to the associated finite-type dynkin diagram. this gives a newconstruction of these lie algebras, in which they come together withinteresting degenerations, corresponding to points outside the open densesubset. our results may prove useful for recognising these lie algebras.
