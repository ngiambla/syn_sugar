in this article, we construct chern classes in rational deligne cohomologyfor coherent sheaves on a smooth complex compact manifold. we prove that theseclasses verify the functoriality property under pullbacks, the whitney formulaand the grothendieck-riemann-roch theorem for projective morphisms betweensmooth complex compact manifolds.
