we introduce equivariant tree models in algebraic statistics, which unify andgeneralise existing tree models such as the general markov model, the strandsymmetric model, and group based models. we focus on the ideals of such models.we show how the ideals for general trees can be determined from the ideals forstars. the main novelty is our proof that this procedure yields the entireideal, not just an ideal defining the model set-theoretically. a corollary oftheoretical importance is that the ideal for a general tree is generated by theideals of its flattenings at vertices.
