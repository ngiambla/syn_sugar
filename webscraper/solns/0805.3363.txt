it is well-known that the kontsevich formality [k97] for hochschild cochainsof the polynomial algebra $a=s(v^*)$ fails if the vector space $v$ isinfinite-dimensional. in the present paper, we study the correspondingobstructions. we construct an $l_\infty$ structure on polyvector fields on $v$having the even degree taylor components, with the degree 2 component given bythe schouten-nijenhuis bracket, but having as well higher non-vanishing taylorcomponents. we prove that this $l_\infty$ algebra is quasi-isomorphic to thecorresponding hochschild cochain complex. we prove that our $l_\infty$ algebrais $l_\infty$ quasi-isomorphic to the lie algebra of polyvector fields on $v$with the schouten-nijenhuis bracket, if $v$ is finite-dimensional.
