this paper deals with two families of algebraic varieties arising fromapplications. first, the k-factor model in statistics, consisting of n-times-ncovariance matrices of n observed gaussian variables that are pairwiseindependent given k hidden gaussian variables. second, chirality varietiesinspired by applications in chemistry. a point in such a chirality varietyrecords chirality measurements of all k-subsets among an n-set of ligands. bothclasses of varieties are given by a parameterisation, while for applicationshaving polynomial equations would be desirable. for instance, such equationscould be used to test whether a given point lies in the variety. we prove thatin a precise sense, which is different for the two classes of varieties, theseequations are finitely characterisable when k is fixed and n grows.
