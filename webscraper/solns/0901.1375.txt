we show that the number of lattice directions in which a d-dimensional convexbody in r^d has minimum width is at most 3^d-1, with equality only for theregular cross-polytope. this is deduced from a sharpened version of the3^d-theorem due to hermann minkowski (22 june 1864--12 january 1909), for whichwe provide two independent proofs.
