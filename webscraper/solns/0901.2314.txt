given a closed, oriented surface x of genus g>1, and a semisimple lie groupg, let r_g be the moduli space of reductive representations of the fundamentalgroup of x in g. we determine the number of connected components of r_pgl(n,r),for n>=4 even. in order to have a first division of connected components, wefirst classify real projective bundles over such a surface. then we achieve ourgoal, using holomorphic methods through the theory of higgs bundles overcompact riemann surfaces. we also show that the complement of the hitchincomponent in r_sl(3,r) is homotopically equivalent to r_so(3).
