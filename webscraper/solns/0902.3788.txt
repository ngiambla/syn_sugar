  we survey some of the concepts, methods, and applications of community
detection, which has become an increasingly important area of network science.
to help ease newcomers into the field, we provide a guide to available
methodology and open problems, and discuss why scientists from diverse
backgrounds are interested in these problems. as a running theme, we emphasize
the connections of community detection to problems in statistical physics and
computational optimization.
