we prove a strong haagerup inequality with operator coefficients.  if for an integer d, h_d denotes the subspace of the von  neumann algebra of a free group f_i spanned by the words of length d in thegenerators (but not their inverses), then we provide in this paper an explicitupper bound on the norm on m_n(h_d), which improves and generalizes previousresults by kemp-speicher (in the scalar case) and buchholz and parcet-pisier(in the non-holomorphic setting). namely the norm of an element of the form$\sum_{i=(i_1,..., i_d)} a_i \otimes \lambda(g_{i_1} ... g_{i_d})$ is less than$4^5 \sqrt e (\|m_0\|^2+...+\|m_d\|^2)^{1/2}$, where m_0,...,m_d are d+1different block-matrices naturally constructed from the family (a_i)_{i \ini^d} for each decomposition of i^d = i^l \times i^{d-l} with l=0,...,d. it isalso proved that the same inequality holds for the norms in the associatednon-commutative l_p spaces when p is an even integer, p>d and when thegenerators of the free group are more generally replaced by *-free r-diagonaloperators. in particular it applies to the case of free circular operators. wealso get inequalities for the non-holomorphic case, with a rate of growth oforder d+1 as for the classical haagerup inequality. the proof is ofcombinatorial nature and is based on the definition and study of asymmetrization process for partitions.
