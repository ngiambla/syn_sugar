we consider median regression and, more generally, a possibly infinitecollection of quantile regressions in high-dimensional sparse models. in thesemodels the overall number of regressors $p$ is very large, possibly larger thanthe sample size $n$, but only $s$ of these regressors have non-zero impact onthe conditional quantile of the response variable, where $s$ grows slower than$n$. we consider quantile regression penalized by the $\ell_1$-norm ofcoefficients ($\ell_1$-qr). first, we show that $\ell_1$-qr is consistent atthe rate $\sqrt{s/n} \sqrt{\log p}$. the overall number of regressors $p$affects the rate only through the $\log p$ factor, thus allowing nearlyexponential growth in the number of zero-impact regressors. the rate resultholds under relatively weak conditions, requiring that $s/n$ converges to zeroat a super-logarithmic speed and that regularization parameter satisfiescertain theoretical constraints. second, we propose a pivotal, data-drivenchoice of the regularization parameter and show that it satisfies thesetheoretical constraints. third, we show that $\ell_1$-qr correctly selects thetrue minimal model as a valid submodel, when the non-zero coefficients of thetrue model are well separated from zero. we also show that the number ofnon-zero coefficients in $\ell_1$-qr is of same stochastic order as $s$.fourth, we analyze the rate of convergence of a two-step estimator that appliesordinary quantile regression to the selected model. fifth, we evaluate theperformance of $\ell_1$-qr in a monte-carlo experiment, and illustrate its useon an international economic growth application.
