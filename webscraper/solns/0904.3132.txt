this work studies the large sample properties of the posterior-basedinference in the curved exponential family under increasing dimension. thecurved structure arises from the imposition of various restrictions on themodel, such as moment restrictions, and plays a fundamental role ineconometrics and others branches of data analysis. we establish conditionsunder which the posterior distribution is approximately normal, which in turnimplies various good properties of estimation and inference procedures based onthe posterior. in the process we also revisit and improve upon previous resultsfor the exponential family under increasing dimension by making use ofconcentration of measure. we also discuss a variety of applications tohigh-dimensional versions of the classical econometric models including themultinomial model with moment restrictions, seemingly unrelated regressionequations, and single structural equation models. in our analysis, both theparameter dimension and the number of moments are increasing with the samplesize.
