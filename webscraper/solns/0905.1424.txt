  owners of a web-site are often interested in analysis of groups of users of
their site. information on these groups can help optimizing the structure and
contents of the site. in this paper we use an approach based on formal concepts
for constructing taxonomies of user groups. for decreasing the huge amount of
concepts that arise in applications, we employ stability index of a concept,
which describes how a group given by a concept extent differs from other such
groups. we analyze resulting taxonomies of user groups for three target
websites.
