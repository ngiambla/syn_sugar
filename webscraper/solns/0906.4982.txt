  the problem of detecting terms that can be interesting to the advertiser is
considered. if a company has already bought some advertising terms which
describe certain services, it is reasonable to find out the terms bought by
competing companies. a part of them can be recommended as future advertising
terms to the company. the goal of this work is to propose better interpretable
recommendations based on fca and association rules.
