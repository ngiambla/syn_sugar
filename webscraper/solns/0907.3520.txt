  we describe the meta-institute for computational astrophysics (mica), the
first professional scientific organization based exclusively in virtual worlds
(vws). the goals of mica are to explore the utility of the emerging vr and vws
technologies for scientific and scholarly work in general, and to facilitate
and accelerate their adoption by the scientific research community. mica itself
is an experiment in academic and scientific practices enabled by the immersive
vr technologies. we describe the current and planned activities and research
directions of mica, and offer some thoughts as to what the future developments
in this arena may be.
