exploiting symmetry in groebner basis computations is difficult when thesymmetry takes the form of a group acting by automorphisms on monomials infinitely many variables. this is largely due to the fact that the groupelements, being invertible, cannot preserve a term order. by contrast, inspiredby work of aschenbrenner and hillar, we introduce the concept of equivariantgroebner basis in a setting where a_monoid_ acts by_homomorphisms_ on monomialsin potentially infinitely many variables. we require that the action becompatible with a term order, and under some further assumptions derive abuchberger-type algorithm for computing equivariant groebner bases. using thisalgorithm and the monoid of strictly increasing functions n -> n we prove thatthe kernel of the ring homomorphism r[y_{ij} | i,j in n, i > j] -> r[s_i,t_i |i in n], y_{ij} -> s_i s_j + t_i t_j is generated by two types of polynomials:off-diagonal 3x3-minors and pentads. this confirms a conjecture by drton,sturmfels, and sullivant on the gaussian two-factor model from algebraicstatistics.
