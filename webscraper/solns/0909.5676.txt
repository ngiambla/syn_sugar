we prove that an alternating e-form on a vector space over aquasi-algebraically closed field always has a singular (e-1)-dimensionalsubspace, provided that the dimension of the space is strictly greater than e.here an (e-1)-dimensional subspace is called singular if pairing it with thee-form yields zero. by the theorem of chevalley and warning our result appliesin particular to finite base fields. our proof is most interesting in the casewhere e=3 and the space has odd dimension n; then it involves a beautifulequivariant map from alternating trilinear forms to polynomials of degree(n-3)/2. we also give a sharp upper bound on the dimension of subspaces all ofwhose 2-dimensional subspaces are singular for a non-degenerate trilinear form.in certain binomial dimensions the trilinear forms attaining this upper boundturn out to form a single orbit under the general linear group, and we classifytheir singular lines.
