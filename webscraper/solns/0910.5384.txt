in this note we prove a conjecture of kashiwara, which states that the eulerclass of a coherent analytic sheaf f on a complex manifold x is the product ofthe chern character of f with the todd class of x. as a corollary, we obtain afunctorial proof of the grothendieck-riemann-roch theorem in hodge cohomologyfor complex manifolds.
