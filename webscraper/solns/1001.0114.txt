in this article, we study topological properties of voisin's punctual hilbertschemes of an almost-complex fourfold $x$. in this setting, we compute theirbetti numbers and construct nakajima operators. we also define tautologicalbundles associated with any complex bundle on $x$, which are shown to becanonical in $k$-theory.
