  technology offers great potential to overcome physical barriers of human
race. this paper presents the methods of enhanced learning applicable to
children having special needs using better human-computer interaction. the
audio-visual (av) effects that the graphic tools or animations help in
achieving better learning, understanding, remembering and performance from such
students. the 3l-r cluster program model enable them to look into pictures and
animated objects while listening to the related audio. it also motivates them
to do the fms development activities like drawing, coloring, tracing etc.,
certain types of games in the clustered model will help the children to improve
concentration, thinking, reasoning, cognitive skills and the eye-to hand

methodology described which provides an ample exposure to the effectiveness of
the training. classify the students with similar problems or disability and the
associated curriculum of modified teaching methodology to meet their special
needs is met through the specialized it tool which form a part of the cluster
model. it ensures effective learning in wards by enhancing multifaceted
interaction. the main objective of this paper is to support the development of
