  development of curriculum and delivery materials has undergone changes over a
period of time, in undergraduate engineering degree system in indian
universities. however, there exists a gap between industry expectations in it
field and skills and knowledge that the graduating engineers possess and this
continues to grow. a similar situation has been seen in the developed countries
like usa, uk and australia. several researchers and practitioners have
discussed and tried to come up with innovative approaches to teaching software
engineering and it as a whole. in india, it is of vital importance that steps
be taken to address this issue seriously. this paper discusses some of the
measures that have been implemented so that this gap is reduced and software
engineers with better skills are produced. changes to curriculum,
industry-academia collaboration through conferences, sabbaticals etc., industry
internships and live projects for final year students are some of the measures
that have been discussed in this paper. the implementation of these measures
may lead to fulfilling the growing requirement for skilled software engineers
who can handle the industry challenges.
