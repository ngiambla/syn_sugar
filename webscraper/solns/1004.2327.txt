for any 1\leq p \leq \infty different from 2, we give examples ofnon-commutative lp spaces without the completely bounded approximationproperty. let f be a non-archimedian local field. if p>4 or p<4/3 and r\geq 3these examples are the non-commutative lp-spaces of the von neumann algebra oflattices in sl_r(f) or in sl_r(\r). for other values of p the examples are thenon-commutative lp-spaces of the von neumann algebra of lattices in sl_r(f) forr large enough depending on p.  we also prove that if r \geq 3 lattices in sl_r(f) or sl_r(\r) do not havethe approximation property of haagerup and kraus. this provides examples ofexact c^*-algebras without the operator space approximation property.
