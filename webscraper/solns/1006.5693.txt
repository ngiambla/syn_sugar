in this paper we introduce and study the $\alpha$-farey map and itsassociated jump transformation, the $\alpha$-l\"uroth map, for an arbitrarycountable partition $\alpha$ of the unit interval with atoms which accumulateonly at the origin. these maps represent linearised generalisations of thefarey map and the gauss map from elementary number theory. first, a thoroughanalysis of some of their topological and ergodic-theoretic properties isgiven, including establishing exactness for both types of these maps. the firstmain result then is to establish weak and strong renewal laws for what we havecalled $\alpha$-sum-level sets for the $\alpha$-l\"uroth map. similar resultshave previously been obtained for the farey map and the gauss map, by usinginfinite ergodic theory. in this respect, a side product of the paper is toallow for greater transparency of some of the core ideas of infinite ergodictheory. the second remaining result is to obtain a complete description of thelyapunov spectra of the $\alpha$-farey map and the $\alpha$-l\"uroth map interms of the thermodynamical formalism. we show how to derive these spectra,and then give various examples which demonstrate the diversity of theirbehaviours in dependence on the chosen partition $\alpha$.
