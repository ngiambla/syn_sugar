  formalist positions towards money are considered from a perspective of formal
methods in computing. the formaleuro (feur) as a dimension for monetary
quantities is proposed as well as the formalbitcoin (fbtc) which represents an
item ready for circulation in a model of informational money.
  an attempt is made to understand the concept of money from scratch. in order
to provide a definition of money the need is felt to make use of a tailored
theory of definition. to that end a theory of imaginative definitions is
presented and its implications for definitions of money are sketched.
  it is argued that a theory of money may be dependent on the role of its
holder. a survey of some roles is given, with the so-called subordinate
administrative role (sar) in a central position.
  the concepts of virtual memory and virtual machine are taken as the point of
departure for a definition of the notion of virtual money. it is argued that
from the perspective of a component (division) of a large organization (org)
its local financial system (lfs) provides a virtual money vm(lfs, org) which
may well fail to meet the most common general and acknowledged moneyness
criteria. inverse moneyness preference is coined as phrase to assert the
tendency of top-management of org to make its virtual money deviate from these
criteria.
