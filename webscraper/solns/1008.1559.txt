in order to apply thermodynamics to systems in which entropy is notextensive, it has become customary to define generalized entropies. while thisapproach has been effective, it is not the only possible approach. we suggestthat some systems, including nanosystems, can be investigated by insteadgeneralizing the concept of extensivity. we begin by reexamining the role oflinearity in the definition of complex physical systems. we show that there isa generalized form of extensivity that can be defined for a number ofnon-linear systems. we further show that a generalization of the principle oflinear superposition is the basis for defining generalized extensivity. weintroduce a definition for the the degree of non-extensivity for systems. weshow that generalized extensivity can be used as a means of understandingcomplex physical systems and we propose extending the idea extensivity beyondthermodynamics to other physical systems, including nanosystems.
