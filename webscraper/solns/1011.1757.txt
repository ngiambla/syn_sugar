we prove extensions of milnor's theorem for germs with nonisolatedsingularity and use them to find new classes of genuine real analytic mappings$\psi$ with positive dimensional singular locus $\sing \psi \subset\psi^{-1}(0)$, for which the milnor fibration exists and yields an open bookstructure with singular binding.
