the peirce quincuncial projection is a mapping of the surface of a sphere tothe interior of a square. it is a conformal map except for four points on theequator. these points of non-conformality cause significant artifacts inphotographic applications. in this paper, we propose an algorithm anduser-interface to mitigate these artifacts. moreover, in order to facilitate aninteractive user-interface, we present a fast algorithm for calculating thepeirce quincuncial projection of spherical imagery. we then promote the peircequincuncial projection as a viable alternative to the more popularstereographic projection in some scenarios.
