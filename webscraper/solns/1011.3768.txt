  online social media are complementing and in some cases replacing
person-to-person social interaction and redefining the diffusion of
information. in particular, microblogs have become crucial grounds on which
public relations, marketing, and political battles are fought. we introduce an
extensible framework that will enable the real-time analysis of meme diffusion
in social media by mining, visualizing, mapping, classifying, and modeling
massive streams of public microblogging events. we describe a web service that
leverages this framework to track political memes in twitter and help detect
astroturfing, smear campaigns, and other misinformation in the context of u.s.
political elections. we present some cases of abusive behaviors uncovered by
our service. finally, we discuss promising preliminary results on the detection
of suspicious memes via supervised learning based on features extracted from
the topology of the diffusion networks, sentiment analysis, and crowdsourced
annotations.
