given any line bundle l of positive degree, on a compact riemann surface, let$m_l^\lambda$ be the moduli space of l-twisted higgs pairs of rank 2 with fixeddeterminant isomorphic to $\lambda$ and traceless higgs field. we give adescription of the singular fibre of the hitchin map $h:m^l_\lambda\toh^0(l^2)$, when the corresponding spectral curve has any singularity of type$a_{m-1}$. in particular, we prove directly that this fibre is connected.
