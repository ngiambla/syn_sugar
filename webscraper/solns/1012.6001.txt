in this paper we consider simplicial families, that is, simplicial objectsindexed by a simplicial set. we develop a method to construct family hypercoverrefinements of a cover family based on the notion of \emph{n-spans} that weintroduce here. in [the fundamental progroupoid of a general topos, journal ofpure and applied algebra 212 (2008)] we had introduced the notion of\emph{covering projection} in a topos. they are locally constant objectssatisfying an additional condition which is valid in all locally constantobjects when the topos is locally connected, and developed the theory of thefundamental groupoid of a general topos. here we show that covering projectionscan be obtained as objects constructed from a descent datum of a simplicial seton a family of sets. we construct a groupoid $\nn{g}_\cc{h}$ such that thecategory $\cc{g}_\cc{h}$ of covering projections trivialized by $\cc{h}$ is itsclassifying topos. this determines a protopos $\{\cc{g} \cc{h}\}_\cc{h}$ and aprogroupoid $\{\nn{g}_\cc{h}\}_\cc{h}$, suitable indexed by a filtered poset ofhypercovers. then we show that this progroupoid classifies torsors. thisconstruction is novel also in the case of locally connected topoi, showing thatlocally constant object in a locally connected topos are constructed by descentfrom a descent datum on a family of sets. the salient feature thatdistinguishes locally connected topoi is that the progroupoid is \emph{strict},that is, the transition morphisms are surjective on triangles, or,equivalently, the transition inverse image functors in the underlyingindcategory are full and faithful.
