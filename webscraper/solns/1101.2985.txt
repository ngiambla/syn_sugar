  devising an appropriate scheme that assigns the weights to share credits
among multiple authors of a paper is a challenging task. this challenge comes
from the fact that different types of conventions might be followed among
different research discipline or research groups. in this paper, we discuss
that for the purpose of evaluating the quality of research produced by authors,
one can resequence either authors or weights and can apply a weight assignment
policy which the evaluator deems fit for the particular research discipline or
research group.
