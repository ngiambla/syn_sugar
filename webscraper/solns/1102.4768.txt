given an alternating trilinear form t on the v=f^n let l_t denote the set oft-singular lines in the projective space pv. these are all lines <a,b> forwhich the linear form t(a,b,.) is identically zero. amongst the immenseprofusion of different kinds of t we single out a few which we deem noteworthyby virtue of the special nature of their set lt.
