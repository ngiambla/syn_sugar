  while social interactions are critical to understanding consumer behavior,
the relationship between social and commerce networks has not been explored on
a large scale. we analyze taobao, a chinese consumer marketplace that is the
world's largest e-commerce website. what sets taobao apart from its competitors
is its integrated instant messaging tool, which buyers can use to ask sellers
about products or ask other buyers for advice. in our study, we focus on how an
individual's commercial transactions are embedded in their social graphs. by
studying triads and the directed closure process, we quantify the presence of
information passing and gain insights into when different types of links form
in the network.
  using seller ratings and review information, we then quantify a price of
trust. how much will a consumer pay for transaction with a trusted seller? we
conclude by modeling this consumer choice problem: if a buyer wishes to
purchase a particular product, how does (s)he decide which store to purchase it
from? by analyzing the performance of various feature sets in an information
retrieval setting, we demonstrate how the social graph factors into
understanding consumer behavior.
