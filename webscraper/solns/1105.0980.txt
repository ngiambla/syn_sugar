although the wetting films are similar in many aspects to other thin liquidfilms, there are some differences in their behavior, too. in contrast to soapand emulsion films, whose surfaces are homogeneous, solid substrates of wettingfilms are heterogeneous as a rule, unless special measures for theirhomogenization are taken. here we mean primarily heterogeneous distribution ofsurface energy leading to existence of hydrophobic domains on hydrophilicsurfaces and vice versa. as is known, such hydrophobic domains could play therole of gas-phase nucleation centers and it is widely accepted nowadays thatnano-bubbles can be formed there. the present paper reviews the effect ofnano-bubbles adhered at solid surface on stability of wetting films. it isshown that the existence of nano-bubbles is crucial for the lifetime of wettingfilms. another peculiarity typical for hydrophobic solid surface, the so-calledslippage effect, is also investigated and its contribution to the dispersionequation of capillary waves on wetting films is accounted for.
