  we analyze ways by which people decompose into groups in distributed systems.
we are interested in systems in which an agent can increase its utility by
connecting to other agents, but must also pay a cost that increases with the
size of the sys- tem. the right balance is achieved by the right size group of
agents. we formulate and analyze three intuitive and realistic games and show
how simple changes in the protocol can dras- tically improve the price of
anarchy of these games. in partic- ular, we identify two important properties
for a low price of anarchy: agreement in joining the system, and the possibil-
ity of appealing a rejection from a system. we show that the latter property is
especially important if there are some pre- existing constraints regarding who
may collaborate (or com- municate) with whom.
