quantile regression (qr) is a principal regression method for analyzing theimpact of covariates on outcomes. the impact is described by the conditionalquantile function and its functionals. in this paper we develop thenonparametric qr-series framework, covering many regressors as a special case,for performing inference on the entire conditional quantile function and itslinear functionals. in this framework, we approximate the entire conditionalquantile function by a linear combination of series terms withquantile-specific coefficients and estimate the function-valued coefficientsfrom the data. we develop large sample theory for the qr-series coefficientprocess, namely we obtain uniform strong approximations to the qr-seriescoefficient process by conditionally pivotal and gaussian processes. based onthese strong approximations, or couplings, we develop four resampling methods(pivotal, gradient bootstrap, gaussian, and weighted bootstrap) that can beused for inference on the entire qr-series coefficient function.  we apply these results to obtain estimation and inference methods for linearfunctionals of the conditional quantile function, such as the conditionalquantile function itself, its partial derivatives, average partial derivatives,and conditional average partial derivatives. specifically, we obtain uniformrates of convergence and show how to use the four resampling methods mentionedabove for inference on the functionals. all of the above results are forfunction-valued parameters, holding uniformly in both the quantile index andthe covariate value, and covering the pointwise case as a by-product. wedemonstrate the practical utility of these results with an example, where weestimate the price elasticity function and test the slutsky condition of theindividual demand for gasoline, as indexed by the individual unobservedpropensity for gasoline consumption.
