this overview paper is intended as a quick introduction to lie algebras ofvector fields. originally introduced in the late 19th century by sophus lie tocapture symmetries of ordinary differential equations, these algebras, orinfinitesimal groups, are a recurring theme in 20th-century research on liealgebras. i will focus on so-called transitive or even primitive lie algebras,and explain their theory due to lie, morozov, dynkin, guillemin, sternberg,blattner, and others. this paper gives just one, subjective overview of thesubject, without trying to be exhaustive.
