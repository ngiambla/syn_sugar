this text is devoted to the systematic study of relative properties in thecontext of berkovich analytic spaces. we first develop a theory of flatness inthis setting. after having shown through a counter-example that naive flatnesscannot be the right notion because it is not stable under base change, wedefine flatness by {\em requiring} invariance under base change, and we study afirst important class of flat morphisms, that of quasi-smooth ones. we thenshow the existence of local {\em d\'evissages} (in the spirit of raynaud andgruson) for coherent sheaves, which we use, together with a study of the localrings of "generic fibers" of morphisms, to prove that a {\em boundaryless},naively flat morphism is flat. after that we prove that the image of a compactanalytic space by a flat morphism can be covered by a compact, relativelycohen-macaulay and zero-dimensional multisection, and the image of the latteris shown to be a compact analytic domain of the target; we thus recover theresult by raynaud telling that the image of a compact analytic space under aflat morphism is a compact analytic domain of the target. in the last part ofthis work we study some validity loci. we first prove that the flatness locusof a given morphism of analytic spaces is a zariski-open subset of the source.we then look at the {\em fiberwise} validity loci of the usual commutativealgebra properties. we prove that the results we could expect actually hold:the fiberwise validity locus of such a property is zariski-constructible, andzariski-open under suitable extra assumptions (flatness, and also sometimesequidimentionality).
