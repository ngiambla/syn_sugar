collapsibility is a combinatorial strengthening of contractibility. we relatethis property to metric geometry by proving the collapsibility of any complexthat is cat(0) with a metric for which all vertex stars are convex. thisstrengthens and generalizes a result by crowley. further consequences of ourwork are:  (1) all cat(0) cube complexes are collapsible.  (2) any triangulated manifold admits a cat(0) metric if and only if it admitscollapsible triangulations.  (3) all contractible d-manifolds ($d \ne 4$) admit collapsible cat(0)triangulations. this discretizes a classical result by ancel--guilbault.
