in this article, we provide a detailed account of a construction sketched bykashiwara in an unpublished manuscript concerning generalized hkr isomorphismsfor smooth analytic cycles whose conormal exact sequence splits. it enables us,among other applications, to solve a problem raised recently by arinkin andc\u{a}ld\u{a}raru about uniqueness of such hkr isomorphisms in the case of thediagonal injection. using this construction, we also associate with any smoothanalytic cycle endowed with an infinitesimal retraction a cycle class which isan obstruction for the cycle to be the vanishing locus of a transverse sectionof a holomorphic vector bundle.
