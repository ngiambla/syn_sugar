we describe a framework in which is possible to develop and implementalgorithms for the approximation of invariant measures of dynamical systemswith a given bound on the error of the approximation.  our approach is based on a general statement on the approximation of fixedpoints for operators between normed vector spaces, allowing an explicitestimation of the error.  we show the flexibility of our approach by applying it to piecewise expandingmaps and to maps with indifferent fixed points. we show how the requiredestimations can be implemented to compute invariant densities up to a givenerror in the $l^{1}$ or $l^\infty $ distance. we also show how to use this tocompute an estimation with certified error for the entropy of those systems.  we show how several related computational and numerical issues can be solvedto obtain working implementations, and experimental results on some onedimensional maps.
