  nations, universities, and regional governments commit resources to promote
the dissemination of scientific and technical knowledge. one focuses on
knowledge-based innovations and the economic function of the university in
terms of technology transfer, intellectual property,
university-industry-government relations, etc. faculties other than engineering
or applied sciences, however, may not be able to recognize opportunities in
this "linear model" of technology transfer. we elaborate a non-market
perspective on the third mission in terms of disclosure of the knowledge and
areas of expertise available for disclosure to other audiences at a provincial
university. the use of ict can enhance communication between actors on the
supply and demand sides. using an idea originally developed in the context of
the dutch science shops, the university staff was questionnaired about keywords
and areas of expertise with the specific purpose of disclosing this information
to audiences other than academic colleagues. the results were brought online in
a thesaurus-like structure that enables users to access the university at the
level of individual email address. this model stimulates variation on both the
supply and demand side of the innovation process, and strengthens the
accessibility and embeddedness of the knowledge base in a regional economy.
