we advocate the use of cluster algebras and their y-variables in the study ofhyperbolic 3-manifolds. we study hyperbolic structures on the mapping tori ofpseudo-anosov mapping classes of punctured surfaces, and show that clustery-variables naturally give the solutions of the edge-gluing conditions of idealtetrahedra. we also comment on the completeness of hyperbolic structures.
