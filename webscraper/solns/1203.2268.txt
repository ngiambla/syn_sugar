  how important are friendships in determining success by individuals and teams
in complex collaborative environments? by combining a novel data set containing
the dynamics of millions of ad hoc teams from the popular multiplayer online
first person shooter halo: reach with survey data on player demographics, play
style, psychometrics and friendships derived from an anonymous online survey,
we investigate the impact of friendship on collaborative and competitive
performance. in addition to finding significant differences in player behavior
across these variables, we find that friendships exert a strong influence,
leading to both improved individual and team performance--even after
controlling for the overall expertise of the team--and increased pro-social
behaviors. players also structure their in-game activities around social
opportunities, and as a result hidden friendship ties can be accurately
inferred directly from behavioral time series. virtual environments that enable
such friendship effects will thus likely see improved collaboration and
competition.
