  this communication presents the genesis and the implementation of a teacher
module, which is included in an assistance tool (at). the teacher module is
based on a teacher model for which we did a thorough analysis of the state of
the art. the aim of the at is to help a teacher to design pedagogical devices.
teachers can formulate their needs (assistance in the design) and the at can
relieve them from repetitive tasks related to the deployment of a teaching
device (assistance in the deployment).
