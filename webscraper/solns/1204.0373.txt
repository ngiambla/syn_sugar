let p be a prime and let a=(a_1,...,a_l) be a sequence of nonzero elements inf_p. in this paper, we study the set of all 0-1 solutions to the equation a_1x_1 + ... + a_l x_l = 0. we prove that whenever l >= p, this set actuallycharacterizes a up to a nonzero multiplicative constant, which is no longertrue for l < p. the critical case l=p is of particular interest. in thiscontext, we prove that whenever l=p and a is nonconstant, the above equationhas at least p-1 minimal 0-1 solutions, thus refining a theorem of olson. thesubcritical case l=p-1 is studied in detail also. our approach is algebraic innature and relies on the combinatorial nullstellensatz as well as on a vospertype theorem.
