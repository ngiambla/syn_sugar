  as the mobile telecommunication systems are growing tremendously all over the
world, the numbers of handheld and base stations are also rapidly growing and
it became very popular to see these base stations distributed everywhere in the
neighborhood and on roof tops which has caused a considerable amount of panic
to the public in palestine concerning wither the radiated electromagnetic
fields from these base stations may cause any health effect or hazard. recently
up high court in india ordered for removal of bts towers from residential area,
it has created panic among cellular communication network designers too. green
cellular networks could be a solution for the above problem. this paper deals
with green cellular networks with the help of multi-layer overlaid hierarchical
structure (macro / micro / pico / femto cells). macrocell for area coverage,
micro for pedestrian and a slow moving traffic while pico for indoor use and
femto for individual high capacity users. this could be the answer of the
problem of energy conservation and enhancement of spectral density also.
