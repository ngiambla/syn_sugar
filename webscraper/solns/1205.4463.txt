  in this work, we define a new pilgrims face recognition dataset, called hufrd
dataset. the new developed dataset presents various pilgrims' images taken from
outside the holy masjid el-harram in makkah during the 2011-2012 hajj and umrah
seasons. such dataset will be used to test our developed facial recognition and
detection algorithms, as well as assess in the missing and found recognition
system \cite{crowdsensing}.
