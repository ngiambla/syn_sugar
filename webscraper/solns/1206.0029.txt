in this paper we consider the motion of a rigid body in a viscousincompressible fluid when some navier slip conditions are prescribed on thebody's boundary. the whole system "viscous incompressible fluid + rigid body"is assumed to occupy the full space $\r^{3}$. we start by proving the existenceof global weak solutions to the cauchy problem. then, we exhibit severalproperties of these solutions.  first, we show that the added-mass effect can be computed which yieldsbetter-than-expected regularity (in time) of the solid velocity-field. moreprecisely we prove that the solid translation and rotation velocities are inthe sobolev space $h^1$. second, we show that the case with the body fixed canbe thought as the limit of infinite inertia of this system, that is when thesolid density is multiplied by a factor converging to $+\infty$. finally weprove the convergence in the energy space of weak solutions "\`a la leray" tosmooth solutions of the system "inviscid incompressible fluid + rigid body" asthe viscosity goes to zero, till the lifetime $t$ of the smooth solution of theinviscid system. moreover we show that the rate of convergence is optimal withrespect to the viscosity and that the solid translation and rotation velocitiesconverge in $h^1 (0,t)$.
