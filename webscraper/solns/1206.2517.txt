  in this paper we address the challenge of assessing the quality of wikipedia
pages using scores derived from edit contribution and contributor
authoritativeness measures. the hypothesis is that pages with significant
contributions from authoritative contributors are likely to be high-quality
pages. contributions are quantified using edit longevity measures and
contributor authoritativeness is scored using centrality metrics in either the
wikipedia talk or co-author networks. the results suggest that it is useful to
take into account the contributor authoritativeness when assessing the
information quality of wikipedia content. the percentile visualization of the
quality scores provides some insights about the anomalous articles, and can be
used to help wikipedia editors to identify start and stub articles that are of
relatively good quality.
