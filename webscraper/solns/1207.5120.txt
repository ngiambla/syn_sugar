let $c$ be a smooth projective curve of genus $g\geq 2$ over $\mathbb c$. fix$n\geq 1$, $d\in {\mathbb z}$. a pair $(e,\phi)$ over $c$ consists of analgebraic vector bundle $e$ of rank $n$ and degree $d$ over $c$ and a section$\phi \in h^0(e)$. there is a concept of stability for pairs which depends on areal parameter $\tau$. let ${\mathfrak m}_\tau(n,d)$ be the moduli space of$\tau$-polystable pairs of rank $n$ and degree $d$ over $c$. here we prove thatfor a generic curve $c$, the moduli space ${\mathfrak m}_\tau(n,d)$ satisfiesthe hodge conjecture for $n \leq 4$. for obtaining this, we prove first that${\mathfrak m}_\tau(n,d)$ is motivated by $c$.
