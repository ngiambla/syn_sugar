recursively compressed inverse preconditioning (rcip) is a numerical methodfor solving fredholm second kind boundary integral equations in situationswhere the boundary shape induces a non-smooth behavior in the solution. themethod originated in 2008 within a scheme for laplace's equation intwo-dimensional domains with corners. in a series of subsequent papers themethod was then refined and extended as to apply to integral equationformulations of a broad range of boundary value problems in physics andengineering. the purpose of the present tutorial is threefold: first, to reviewthe rcip method in a simple setting. second, to show how easily the method canbe implemented in matlab. third, to present new applications.
