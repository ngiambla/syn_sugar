michel raynaud gave a criterion for a three-point g-cover f : y \rightarrow x= p^1, defined over a p-adic field k, to have good reduction. in particular, ifthe order of a p-sylow subgroup of g is p, and the number of conjugacy classesof elements of order p is greater than the absolute ramification index e of k,then f has potentially good reduction. we give a different proof of thiscriterion, which extends to the case where g has an arbitrarily large cyclicp-sylow subgroup, answering a question of raynaud. we then use the criterion togive a family of examples of three-point covers with good reduction tocharacteristic p and arbitrarily large p-sylow subgroups.
