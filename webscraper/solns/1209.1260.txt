  using data from the web of science (wos), we analyze the mutual information
among university, industrial, and governmental addresses (u-i-g) at the country
level for a number of countries. the dynamic evolution of the triple helix can
thus be compared among developed and developing nations in terms of
cross-sectorial co-authorship relations. the results show that the triple-helix
interactions among the three subsystems u-i-g become less intensive over time,
but unequally for different countries. we suggest that globalization erodes
local triple-helix relations and thus can be expected to increase
differentiation in national systems since the mid-1990s. this effect of
globalization is more pronounced in developed countries than in developing
ones. in the dynamic analysis, we focus on a more detailed comparison between
china and the usa. the chinese academy of the (social) sciences changes
increasingly from a public research institute to an academic one, and this has
a measurable effect on china's position in the globalization.
