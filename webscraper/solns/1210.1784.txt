we derive exact general relations between various observables for n bosonswith zero-range interactions, in two or three dimensions, in an arbitraryexternal potential. some of our results are analogous to relations derivedpreviously for two-component fermions, and involve derivatives of the energywith respect to the two-body s-wave scattering length a. moreover, in thethree-dimensional case, where the efimov effect takes place, the interactionsare characterized not only by a, but also by a three-body parameter r\_t. wethen find additional relations which involve the derivative of the energy withrespect r\_t. in short, this derivative gives the probability to find threeparticles close to each other. although it is evaluated for a totally loss-lessmodel, it remarkably also gives the three-body loss rate always present inexperiments (due to three-body recombination to deeply bound diatomicmolecules), at least in the limit where the so-called inelasticity parametereta is small enough. as an application, we obtain, within the zero-range modeland to first order in eta, an analytic expression for the three-body loss rateconstant for a non-degenerate bose gas with infinite scattering length. we alsodiscuss the generalization to arbitrary mixtures of bosons and/or fermions.
