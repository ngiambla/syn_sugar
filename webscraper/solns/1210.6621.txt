  in this paper we define the notion of a privacy design strategy. these
strategies help it architects to support privacy by design early in the
software development life cycle, during concept development and analysis. using
current data protection legislation as point of departure we derive the
following eight privacy design strategies: minimise, hide, separate, aggregate,
inform, control, enforce, and demonstrate. the strategies also provide a useful
classification of privacy design patterns and the underlying privacy enhancing
technologies. we therefore believe that these privacy design strategies are not
only useful when designing privacy friendly systems, but also helpful when
evaluating the privacy impact of existing it systems.
