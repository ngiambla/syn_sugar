we study time harmonic scattering for the helmholtz equation in rn. we showthat certain penetrable scatterers with rectangular corners scatter everyincident wave nontrivially. even though these scatterers have interiortransmission eigenvalues, the relative scattering (a.k.a. far field) operatorhas a trivial kernel and cokernel at every real wavenumber.
