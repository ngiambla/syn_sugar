  using a mathematical model, we show that a triple helix (th) system contains
self-interaction, and therefore self-organization of innovations can be
expected in waves, whereas a double helix (dh) remains determined by its linear
constituents. (the mathematical model is fully elaborated in the appendices.)
the ensuing innovation systems can be expected to have a fractal structure:
innovation systems at different scales can be considered as spanned in a
cartesian space with the dimensions of (s)cience, (b)usiness, and (g)overnment.
a national system, for example, contains sectorial and regional systems, and is
a constituent part in technological and supra-national systems of innovation.
the mathematical modeling enables us to clarify the mechanisms, and provides
new possibilities for the prediction. emerging technologies can be expected to
be more diversified and their life cycles will become shorter than before. in
terms of policy implications, the model suggests a shift from the production of
material objects to the production of innovative technologies.
