in a recent paper, hauenstein, sturmfels, and the second author discovered aconjectural bijection between critical points of the likelihood function on thecomplex variety of matrices of rank r and critical points on the complexvariety of matrices of co-rank r-1. in this paper, we prove that conjecture forrectangular matrices and for symmetric matrices, as well as a variant forskew-symmetric matrices. to appear in international mathematics researchnotices.
