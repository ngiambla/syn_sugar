  we introduce a model for predicting page-view dynamics of promoted content.
the regularity of the content promotion process on wikipedia provides excellent
experimental conditions which favour detailed modelling. we show that the
popularity of an article featured on wikipedia's main page decays exponentially
in time if the circadian cycles of the users are taken into account. our model
can be explained as the result of individual poisson processes and is validated
through empirical measurements. it provides a simpler explanation for the
evolution of content popularity than previous studies.
