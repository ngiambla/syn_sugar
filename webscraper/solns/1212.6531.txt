  knowing that an enterprise is a complex reality, it is necessary to develop a
modeling framework allowing the description of system structure and dynamics
that alter the structure. the concept of enterprise modeling addresses this
need and many techniques have emerged. our goal is to provide leaders of
algerian enterprise an overview of modeling techniques. thus these managers may
elect, in collaboration with the university, the modeling technique best suited
to their requirements. twe believe that this could be a step towards an
effective reorganization of the enterprise leading. tthis article proposes a
domain ontology and multi-criteria analysis in the frame of modeling
enterprise. our approach is based on two stages using the prot\'eg\'e tool for
the technique representation and the promethee method for their evaluation. the
result is a ranking between the different techniques, which allows selecting
the most appropriate methodology according to the criteria for a given
tenterprise.
