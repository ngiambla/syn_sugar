we present new results concerning threshold functions for a wide family ofrandom intersection graphs. to this end we apply the coupling method used forestablishing threshold functions for homogeneous random intersection graphsintroduced by karo\'nski, scheinerman, and singer--cohen. in the case ofinhomogeneous random intersection graphs the method has to be considerablymodified and extended. by means of the altered method we are able to establishthreshold functions for a general random intersection graph for such propertiesas $k$-connectivity, matching containment or hamiltonicity. moreover using thenew approach we manage to sharpen the best known results concerning homogeneousrandom intersection graph.
