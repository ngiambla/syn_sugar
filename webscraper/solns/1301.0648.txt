  the is-impact measurement model, developed by gable, sedera and chan in 2008,
represents the to-date and expected stream of net profits from a given
information system (is), as perceived by all major user classes. although this
model has been stringently validated in previous studies, its generalizability
and verified effectiveness are enhanced through this new application in
e-learning. this paper focuses on the re-validation of the findings of the
is-impact model in two universities in the kingdom of saudi arabia (ksa). among
the users of 2 universities e-learning systems, 528 students were recruited. a
formative validation measurement with smartpls, a graphical structural equation
modeling tool was used to analyse the collected data. on the basis of the
smartpls results, as well as with the aid of data-supported is impact
measurements and dimensions, we confirmed the validity of the is-impact model
for assessing the effect of e-learning systems in ksa universities. the newly
constructed model is more understandable, its use was proved as robust and
applicable to various circumstances.
