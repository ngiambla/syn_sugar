  the first international workshop on trends in functional programming in
education, tfpie 2012, was held on june 11, 2012 at the university of st
andrews in scotland. the goal of tfpie is to gather researchers, professors,
teachers, and all professionals that use or are interested in the use of
functional programming in education. submissions were vetted by the tfpie 2012
program committee using prevailing academic standards. the 4 articles in this
volume were selected for publication as the result of this process. these
articles cover a wide range of novel approaches in education using functional
programming. page and gamboa describe how they introduce students to
computational thinking and problem solving using logic and equation-based
reasoning. o'donnell describes efforts to make computer systems courses come
alive through the use of simulation and a functional hardware description
language. radge describes a novel approach to cs1 exploiting the interplay of
the imprecision found in mathematical abstractions and the precision that is
required in programming. stutterheim, swierstra, and swierstra describe a new
approach to introduce high school students to programming and to important
ideas in computer science using a web-based interpreter and theorem prover.
