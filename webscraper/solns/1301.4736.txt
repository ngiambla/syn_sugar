given a metric space $(x,d)$, the wobbling group of $x$ is the group ofbijections $g:x\rightarrow x$ satisfying $\sup\limits_{x\in x}d(g(x),x)<\infty$. we study algebraic and analytic properties of $w(x)$ inrelation with the metric space structure of $x$, such as amenability of theaction of the lamplighter group $ \bigoplus_{x} \mathbf z/2\mathbf z \rtimesw(x)$ on $\bigoplus_{x} \mathbf z/2\mathbf z$ and property (t).
