  this study introduces a structured analysis of science parks as arenas
designed to stimulate institutional collaboration and the commercialization of
academic knowledge and technology, and the promotion of social welfare. a
framework for key actors and their potential behaviour in this context is
introduced based on the triple helix (th) model and related literature. a link
analysis was conducted to build an inter-linking network that may map the
infrastructure support network through the online interactions of the
organisations involved in york science park. a comparison between the framework
and the diagram shows that the framework can be used to identify most of the
actors and assess their interconnections. the web patterns found correspond to
previous evaluations based on traditional indicators and suggest that the
network, which is developed to foster and support innovation, arises from the
functional cooperation between the university of york and regional authorities,
which both serve as the major driving forces in the trilateral linkages and the
development of an innovation infrastructure.
