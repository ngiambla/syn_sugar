  what would you teach if you had only one course to help students grasp the
essence of computation and perhaps inspire a few of them to make computing a
subject of further study? assume they have the standard college prep
background. this would include basic algebra, but not necessarily more advanced
mathematics. they would have written a few term papers, but would not have
written computer programs. they could surf and twitter, but could not
exclusive-or and nand. what about computers would interest them or help them
place their experience in context? this paper provides one possible answer to
this question by discussing a course that has completed its second iteration.
grounded in classical logic, elucidated in digital circuits and computer
software, it expands into areas such as cpu components and massive databases.
the course has succeeded in garnering the enthusiastic attention of students
with a broad range of interests, exercising their problem solving skills, and
introducing them to computational thinking.
