  this paper documents our experience using declarative languages to give
secondary school students a first taste of computer science. the course aims to
teach students a bit about programming in prolog, but also exposes them to
important computer science concepts, such as unification or searching
strategies. using haskell's snap framework in combination with our own
nanoprolog library, we have developed a web application to teach this course.
