we study derived intersections of smooth analytic cycles, and provide in somecases necessary and sufficient conditions for this intersection be formal. inparticular, if x is a complex submanifold of a complex manifold y, we provethat x can be quantized if and only if the derived intersection of xxx and\delta_y is formal in d(xxx).
