we consider a linear hamiltonian system consisting of a classical particleand a scalar field describing by the wave or klein-gordon equations withvariable coefficients. the initial data of the system are supposed to be arandom function which has some mixing properties. we study the distribution\mu_t of the random solution at time moments t\in\r. the main result is theconvergence of \mu_t to a gaussian probability measure as t\to\infty. themixing properties of the limit measures are studied. the application to thecase of gibbs initial measures is given.
