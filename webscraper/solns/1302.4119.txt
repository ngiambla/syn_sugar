in this paper, we consider a special class of singular finsler metrics:$m$-kropina metrics which are defined by a riemannian metric and a $1$-form. weshow that an $m$-kropina metric ($m\ne -1$) of scalar flag curvature must belocally minkowskian in dimension $n\ge 3$. we characterize by some pdes akropina metric ($m=-1$) which is respectively of scalar flag curvature andlocally projectively flat in dimension $n\ge 3$, and obtain some principles andapproaches of constructing non-trivial examples of kropina metrics of scalarflag curvature.
