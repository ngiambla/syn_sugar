consider a completely bounded fourier multiplier phi of a locally compactgroup g, and take 1 <= p <= infinity. one can associate to phi a schurmultiplier on the schatten classes s_p(l^2 g), as well as a fourier multiplieron lp(lg), the non-commutative lp-space of the group von neumann algebra of g.we prove that the completely bounded norm of the schur multiplier is notgreater than the completely bounded norm of the lp-fourier multiplier. when gis amenable we show that equality holds, extending a result by neuwirth andricard to non-discrete groups.  for a discrete group g and in the special case when p > 2 is an even integer,we show the following. if there exists a map between lp(lg) and an ultraproductof lp(m) \otimes s_p(l^2 g) that intertwines the fourier multiplier with theschur multiplier, then g must be amenable. this is an obstruction to extend theneuwirth-ricard result to non-amenable groups.
