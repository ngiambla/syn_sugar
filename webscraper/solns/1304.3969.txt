this paper considers generalized linear models in the presence of manycontrols. we lay out a general methodology to estimate an effect of interestbased on the construction of an instrument that immunize against modelselection mistakes and apply it to the case of logistic binary choice model.more specifically we propose new methods for estimating and constructingconfidence regions for a regression parameter of primary interest $\alpha_0$, aparameter in front of the regressor of interest, such as the treatment variableor a policy variable. these methods allow to estimate $\alpha_0$ at theroot-$n$ rate when the total number $p$ of other regressors, called controls,potentially exceed the sample size $n$ using sparsity assumptions. the sparsityassumption means that there is a subset of $s<n$ controls which suffices toaccurately approximate the nuisance part of the regression function.importantly, the estimators and these resulting confidence regions are validuniformly over $s$-sparse models satisfying $s^2\log^2 p = o(n)$ and othertechnical conditions. these procedures do not rely on traditional consistentmodel selection arguments for their validity. in fact, they are robust withrespect to moderate model selection mistakes in variable selection. undersuitable conditions, the estimators are semi-parametrically efficient in thesense of attaining the semi-parametric efficiency bounds for the class ofmodels in this paper.
