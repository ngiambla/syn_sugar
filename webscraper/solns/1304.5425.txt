we show that there is a residual subset $\mathcal{r}$ of $diff^1(m)$ suchthat for any $f\in\mathcal{r}$ and any partially hyperbolic homoclinic class$h(p,f)$ with one dimensional center direction, the set of central lyapunovexponents associated with the ergodic with either full support or positiveentropy is an interval.
