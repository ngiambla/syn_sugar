we study the behavior of test ideals and f-singularities in families. inparticular, we obtain generic (and non-generic) restriction theorems for testideals and non-f-pure ideals. additionally, we study the global behavior ofcertain canonical linear systems (induced by frobenius) associated to adjointline bundles, in families. as a consequence, we obtain some positivity resultsfor pushforwards of some adjoint line bundles and for certain subsheaves ofthese.
