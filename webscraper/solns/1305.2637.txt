we show that amenability of a group acting by homeomorphisms can be deducedfrom a certain local property of the action and recurrency of the orbitalschreier graphs. this covers amenability of a wide class groups, theamenability of which was an open problem, as well as unifies many knownexamples to one general proof. in particular, this includes grigorchuk's group,basilica group, the full topological group of cantor minimal system, groupsacting on rooted trees by bounded automorphisms, groups generated by finiteautomata of linear activity growth, groups that naturally appear in holomorphicdynamics.
