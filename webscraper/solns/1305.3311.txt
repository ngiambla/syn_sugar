  the dominant understanding of internet censorship posits that blocking access
to foreign-based websites creates isolated communities of internet users. we
question this discourse for its assumption that if given access people would
use all websites. we develop a conceptual framework that integrates access
blockage with social structures to explain web users' choices, and argue that
users visit websites they find culturally proximate and access blockage matters
only when such sites are blocked. we examine the case of china, where online
blockage is notoriously comprehensive, and compare chinese web usage patterns
with those elsewhere. analyzing audience traffic among the 1000 most visited
websites, we find that websites cluster according to language and geography.
chinese websites constitute one cluster, which resembles other such
geo-linguistic clusters in terms of both its composition and degree of
isolation. our sociological investigation reveals a greater role of cultural
proximity than access blockage in explaining online behaviors.
