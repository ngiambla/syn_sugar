the gopakumar-vafa conjecture predicts that the gromov-witten invariants of acalabi-yau 3-fold can be canonically expressed in terms of integer invariantscalled bps numbers. using the methods of symplectic gromov-witten theory, weprove that the gopakumar-vafa formula holds for any symplectic calabi-yau6-manifold, and hence for calabi-yau 3-folds. the results extend to allsymplectic 6-manifolds and to the genus zero gw invariants of semipositivemanifolds.
