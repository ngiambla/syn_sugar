we study the metric entropy of the metric space $b_n$ of all n-dimensionalbanach spaces (the so-called banach-mazur compactum) equipped with thebanach-mazur (multiplicative) "distance" $d$. we are interested either inestimates independent of the dimension or in asymptotic estimates when thedimension tends to $\infty$. for instance, we prove that, if $n({b_n},d,1+\varepsilon)$ is the smallest number of "balls" of "radius" $1+\varepsilon$that cover $ b_n$, then for any $\varepsilon>0$ we have $$0<\liminf_{n\to\infty}n^{-1} \log\log n(b_n,d,1+\varepsilon)\le \limsup_{n\to \infty}n^{-1}\log\log n(b_n,d,1+\varepsilon)<\infty.$$ we also prove an analogous result forthe metric entropy of the set of n-dimensional operator spaces equipped withthe distance $d_n$ naturally associated to $n\times n$-matrices with operatorentries. in that case $n$ is arbitrary but our estimates are validindependently of $n$. in the banach space case (i.e.n=1) the above upper boundis part of the folklore, and the lower bound is at least partially known (butapparently has not appeared in print). while we follow the same approach inboth cases, the matricial case requires more delicate ingredients, namelyestimates (from our previous work) on certain $n$-tuples of $n\times n$ unitarymatrices known as "quantum expanders".
