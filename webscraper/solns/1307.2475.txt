we prove that sl(3,r) has strong banach property (t) in lafforgue's sensewith respect to the banach spaces that are $\theta>0$ interpolation spaces (forthe complex interpolation method) between an arbitrary banach space and abanach space with sufficiently good type and cotype. as a consequence, everyaction of sl(3,r) or its lattices by affine isometries on such a banach space xhas a fixed point, and the expanders contructed from sl(3,z) do not admit acoarse embedding into x. we also prove a quantitative decay of matrixcoefficients (howe-moore property) for representations with small exponentialgrowth of sl(3,r) on x.  this class of banach spaces contains many superreflexive spaces and somenonreflexive spaces as well. we see no obstruction for this class to be equalto all spaces with nontrivial type.
