the partial representation extension problem is a recently introducedgeneralization of the recognition problem. a circle graph is an intersectiongraph of chords of a circle. we study the partial representation extensionproblem for circle graphs, where the input consists of a graph $g$ and apartial representation $\cal r'$ giving some pre-drawn chords that represent aninduced subgraph of $g$. the question is whether one can extend $\cal r'$ to arepresentation $\cal r$ of the entire graph $g$, i.e., whether one can draw theremaining chords into a partially pre-drawn representation to obtain arepresentation of $g$. our main result is an $o(n^3)$ time algorithm forpartial representation extension of circle graphs, where $n$ is the number ofvertices. to show this, we describe the structure of all representations of acircle graph using split decomposition. this can be of independent interest.
