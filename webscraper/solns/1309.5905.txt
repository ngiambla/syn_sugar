in this paper we introduce constructible analogs of the discrete complexityclasses $\mathbf{vp}$ and $\mathbf{vnp}$ of sequences of functions. thefunctions in the new definitions are constructible functions on $\mathbb{r}^n$or $\mathbb{c}^n$. we define a class of sequences of constructible functionsthat play a role analogous to that of $\mathbf{vp}$ in the more classicaltheory. the class analogous to $\mathbf{vnp}$ is defined using eulerintegration. we discuss several examples, develop a theory of completeness, andpose a conjecture analogous to the $\mathbf{vp}$ vs. $\mathbf{vnp}$ conjecturein the classical case. in the second part of the paper we extend the notions ofcomplexity classes to sequences of constructible sheaves over $\mathbb{r}^n$(or its one point compactification). we introduce a class of sequences ofsimple constructible sheaves, that could be seen as the sheaf-theoretic analogof the blum-shub-smale class $\mathbf{p}_{\mathbb{r}}$. we also define ahierarchy of complexity classes of sheaves mirroring the polynomial hierarchy,$\mathbf{ph}_{\mathbb{r}}$, in the b-s-s theory. we prove a singly exponentialupper bound on the topological complexity of the sheaves in this hierarchymirroring a similar result in the b-s-s setting. we obtain as a result analgorithm with singly exponential complexity for a sheaf-theoretic variant ofthe real quantifier elimination problem. we pose the natural sheaf-theoreticanalogs of the classical $\mathbf{p}$ vs. $\mathbf{np}$ question, and alsodiscuss a connection with toda's theorem from discrete complexity theory in thecontext of constructible sheaves. we also discuss possible generalizations ofthe questions in complexity theory related to separation of complexity classesto more general categories via sequences of adjoint pairs of functors.
