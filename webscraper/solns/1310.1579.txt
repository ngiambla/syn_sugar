before a cell divides into two daughter cells, chromosomes are replicatedresulting in two sister chromosomes embracing each other. each sisterchromosome is bound to a separate proteinous structure, called kinetochore(kt), that captures the tip of a filamentous protein, called microtubule (mt).two oppositely oriented mts pull the two kts attached to two sister chromosomesthereby pulling the two sisters away from each other. here we theoreticallystudy an even simpler system, namely an isolated kt coupled to a single mt;this system mimics an {\it in-vitro} experiment where a single kt-mt attachmentis reconstituted using purified extracts from budding yeast. our models notonly account for the experimentally observed "catch-bond-like" behavior of thekt-mt coupling, but also make new predictions on the probability distributionof the lifetimes of the attachments. in principle, our new predictions can betested by analyzing the data collected in the {\it in-vitro} experimentsprovided the experiment is repeated sufficiently large number of times. ourtheory provides a deep insight into the effects of (a) size, (b) energetics,and (c) stochastic kinetics of the kt-mt coupling on the distribution of thelifetimes of these attachments.
