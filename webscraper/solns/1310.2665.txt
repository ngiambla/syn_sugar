  the increasing pervasiveness of social media creates new opportunities to
study human social behavior, while challenging our capability to analyze their
massive data streams. one of the emerging tasks is to distinguish between
different kinds of activities, for example engineered misinformation campaigns
versus spontaneous communication. such detection problems require a formal
definition of meme, or unit of information that can spread from person to
person through the social network. once a meme is identified, supervised
learning methods can be applied to classify different types of communication.
the appropriate granularity of a meme, however, is hardly captured from
existing entities such as tags and keywords. here we present a framework for
the novel task of detecting memes by clustering messages from large streams of
social data. we evaluate various similarity measures that leverage content,
metadata, network features, and their combinations. we also explore the idea of
pre-clustering on the basis of existing entities. a systematic evaluation is
carried out using a manually curated dataset as ground truth. our analysis
shows that pre-clustering and a combination of heterogeneous features yield the
best trade-off between number of clusters and their quality, demonstrating that
a simple combination based on pairwise maximization of similarity is as
effective as a non-trivial optimization of parameters. our approach is fully
automatic, unsupervised, and scalable for real-time detection of memes in
streaming data.
