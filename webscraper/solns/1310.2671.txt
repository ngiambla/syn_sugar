  trending topics are the online conversations that grab collective attention
on social media. they are continually changing and often reflect exogenous
events that happen in the real world. trends are localized in space and time as
they are driven by activity in specific geographic areas that act as sources of
traffic and information flow. taken independently, trends and geography have
been discussed in recent literature on online social media; although, so far,
little has been done to characterize the relation between trends and geography.
here we investigate more than eleven thousand topics that trended on twitter in
63 main us locations during a period of 50 days in 2013. this data allows us to
study the origins and pathways of trends, how they compete for popularity at
the local level to emerge as winners at the country level, and what dynamics
underlie their production and consumption in different geographic areas. we
identify two main classes of trending topics: those that surface locally,
coinciding with three different geographic clusters (east coast, midwest and
southwest); and those that emerge globally from several metropolitan areas,
coinciding with the major air traffic hubs of the country. these hubs act as
trendsetters, generating topics that eventually trend at the country level, and
driving the conversation across the country. this poses an intriguing
conjecture, drawing a parallel between the spread of information and diseases:
do trends travel faster by airplane than over the internet?
