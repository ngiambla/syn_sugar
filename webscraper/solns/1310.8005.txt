let x --> p^2 be a p-cyclic cover branched over a smooth, connected curve cof degree divisible by p, defined over a separably closed field of prime-to-pcharacteristic. we show that all (unramified) p-torsion brauer classes on xthat are fixed by aut(x/p^2) arise as pullbacks of certain brauer classes onk(p^2) that are unramified away from c and a fixed line l. we completelycharacterize these brauer classes on k(p^2) and relate the kernel of thepullback map to the picard group of x.  if p = 2, we give a second construction, which works over any base field ofcharacteristic not 2, that uses clifford algebras arising from symmetricresolutions of line bundles on c to yield azumaya representatives for the2-torision brauer classes on x. we show that, when p=2 and sqrt{-1} is in ourbase field, both constructions give the same result.
