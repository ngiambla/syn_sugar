a radial probability measure is a probability measure with a density (withrespect to the lebesgue measure) which depends only on the distances to theorigin. consider the euclidean space enhanced with a radial probabilitymeasure. a correlation problem concerns showing whether the radial measure ofthe intersection of two symmetric convex bodies is greater than the product ofthe radial measures of the two convex bodies. a radial measure satisfying thisproperty is said to satisfy the correlation property. a major question in thisfield is about the correlation property of the (standard) gaussian measure. themain result in this paper is a theorem suggesting a sufficient condition for aradial measure to satisfy the correlation property. a consequence of the maintheorem will be a proof of the correlation property of the gaussian measure.
