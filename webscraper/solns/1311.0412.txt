we study the problem of nonparametric regression when the regressor isendogenous, which is an important nonparametric instrumental variables (npiv)regression in econometrics and a difficult ill-posed inverse problem withunknown operator in statistics. we first establish a general upper bound on thesup-norm (uniform) convergence rate of a sieve estimator, allowing forendogenous regressors and weakly dependent data. this result leads to theoptimal sup-norm convergence rates for spline and wavelet least squaresregression estimators under weakly dependent data and heavy-tailed error terms.this upper bound also yields the sup-norm convergence rates for sieve npivestimators under i.i.d. data: the rates coincide with the known optimal$l^2$-norm rates for severely ill-posed problems, and are power of $\log(n)$slower than the optimal $l^2$-norm rates for mildly ill-posed problems. we thenestablish the minimax risk lower bound in sup-norm loss, which coincides withour upper bounds on sup-norm rates for the spline and wavelet sieve npivestimators. this sup-norm rate optimality provides another justification forthe wide application of sieve npiv estimators. useful results onweakly-dependent random matrices are also provided.
