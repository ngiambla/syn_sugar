we construct a class of spacetimes (without symmetry assumptions) satisfyingthe vacuum einstein equations with singular boundaries on two nullhypersurfaces intersecting in the future on a 2-sphere. the metric of thesespacetimes extends continuously beyond the singularities while the christoffelsymbols fail to be square integrable in a neighborhood of any point on thesingular boundaries. the construction shows moreover that the singularities arestable in a suitable sense. these singularities are stronger than the impulsivegravitational spacetimes considered by luk-rodnianski and conjecturally theyare present in the interior of generic black holes arising from gravitationalcollapse.
