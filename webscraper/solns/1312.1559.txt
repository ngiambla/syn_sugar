an outerstring graph is an intersection graph of curves that lie in a commonhalf-plane and have one endpoint on the boundary of that half-plane. we provethat the class of outerstring graphs is $\chi$-bounded, which means that theirchromatic number is bounded by a function of their clique number. thisgeneralizes a series of previous results on $\chi$-boundedness of outerstringgraphs with various additional restrictions on the shape of curves or thenumber of times the pairs of curves can cross. the assumption that each curvehas an endpoint on the boundary of the half-plane is justified by the knownfact that triangle-free intersection graphs of straight-line segments can havearbitrarily large chromatic number.
