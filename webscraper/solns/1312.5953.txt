rota's basis conjecture states that in any square array of vectors whose rowsare bases of a fixed vector space the vectors can be rearranged within theirrows in such a way that afterwards not only the rows are bases, but also thecolumns. we discuss an online version of this conjecture, in which thepermutation used for rearranging the vectors in a given row must be determinedwithout knowledge of the vectors further down the array. the paper containssurprises both for those who believe this online basis conjecture at firstglance, and for those who disbelieve it.
