universal extensions arise naturally in the auslander bijections. for anabelian category having auslander-reiten duality, we exploit a bijectiontriangle, which involves the auslander bijections, universal extensions and theauslander-reiten duality. some consequences are given, in particular, aconjecture by ringel is verified.
