this work proposes new inference methods for a regression coefficient ofinterest in a (heterogeneous) quantile regression model. we consider ahigh-dimensional model where the number of regressors potentially exceeds thesample size but a subset of them suffice to construct a reasonableapproximation to the conditional quantile function. the proposed methods are(explicitly or implicitly) based on orthogonal score functions that protectagainst moderate model selection mistakes, which are often inevitable in theapproximately sparse model considered in the present paper. we establish theuniform validity of the proposed confidence regions for the quantile regressioncoefficient. importantly, these methods directly apply to more than onevariable and a continuum of quantile indices. in addition, the performance ofthe proposed methods is illustrated through monte-carlo experiments and anempirical example, dealing with risk factors in childhood malnutrition.
