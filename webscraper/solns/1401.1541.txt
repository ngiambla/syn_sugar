circle graphs are intersection graphs of chords in a circle and $k$-polygongraphs are intersection graphs of chords in a convex $k$-sided polygon whereeach chord has its endpoints on distinct sides. the $k$-polygon graphs, for $k\ge 2$, form an infinite chain of graph classes, each of which contains theclass of permutation graphs. the union of all of those graph classes is theclass of circle graphs. the polygon number $\gp(g)$ of a circle graph $g$ isthe minimum $k$ such that $g$ is a $k$-polygon graph. given a circle graph $g$and an integer $k$, determining whether $\gp(g) \le k$ is np-complete, whilethe problem is solvable in polynomial time for fixed $k$.  in this paper, we show that $\gp(g)$ is always at least as large as theasteroidal number of $g$, and equal to the asteroidal number of $g$ when $g$ isa connected distance hereditary graph that is not a clique. this implies thatthe classes of distance hereditary permutation graphs and distance hereditaryat-free graphs are the same, and we give a forbidden subgraph characterizationof that class. we also establish the following upper bounds: $\gp(g)$ is atmost the clique cover number of $g$ if $g$ is not a clique, at most 1 plus theindependence number of $g$, and at most $\lceil n/2 \rceil$ where $n \ge 3$ isthe number of vertices of $g$. our results lead to linear time algorithms forfinding the minimum number of corners that must be added to a given circlerepresentation to produce a polygon representation, and for finding theasteroidal number of a distance hereditary graph, both of which areimprovements over previous algorithms for those problems.
