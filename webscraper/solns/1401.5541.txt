we develop a lagrangian approach to conservation-law anomalies in weaksolutions of inviscid burgers equation, motivated by previous work on thekraichnan model of turbulent scalar advection. we show that the entropysolutions of burgers possess markov stochastic processes of (generalized)lagrangian trajectories backward in time for which the burgers velocity is abackward martingale. this property is shown to guarantee dissipativity ofconservation-law anomalies for general convex functions of the velocity. thebackward stochastic burgers flows with these properties are not unique,however. we construct infinitely many such stochastic flows, both by ageometric construction and by the zero-noise limit of the constantin-iyerstochastic representation of viscous burgers solutions. the latter proof yieldsthe spontaneous stochasticity of lagrangian trajectories backward in time forburgers, at unit prandtl number. it is conjectured that existence of a backwardstochastic flow with the velocity as martingale is an admissibility conditionwhich selects the unique entropy solution for burgers. we also study lineartransport of passive densities and scalars by inviscid burgers flows. we showthat shock solutions of burgers exhibit spontaneous stochasticity backward intime for all prandtl numbers, implying conservation-law anomalies for lineartransport. we discuss the relation of our results for burgers withincompressible navier-stokes turbulence, especially lagrangian admissibilityconditions for euler solutions and the relation between turbulent cascadedirections and time-asymmetry of lagrangian stochasticity.
