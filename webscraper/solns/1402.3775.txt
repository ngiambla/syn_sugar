in this paper, we propose new spectral viscosity methods based on thegeneralized hermite functions for the solution of nonlinear scalar conservationlaws in the whole line. it is shown rigorously that these schemes converge tothe unique entropy solution by using compensated compactness arguments, undersome conditions. the numerical experiments of the inviscid burger's equationsupport our result, and it verifies the reasonableness of the conditions.
