the point vortex system is usually considered as an idealized model where thevorticity of an ideal incompressible two-dimensional fluid is concentrated in afinite number of moving points. in the case of a single vortex in an otherwiseirrotational ideal fluid occupying a bounded and simply-connectedtwo-dimensional domain the motion is given by the so-called kirchhoff-routhvelocity which depends only on the domain. the main result of this paperestablishes that this dynamics can also be obtained as the limit of the motionof a rigid body immersed in such a fluid when the body shrinks to a masslesspoint particle with fixed circulation. the rigid body is assumed to be onlyaccelerated by the force exerted by the fluid pressure on its boundary, thefluid velocity and pressure being given by the incompressible euler equations,with zero vorticity. the circulation of the fluid velocity around the particleis conserved as time proceeds according to kelvin's theorem and gives thestrength of the limit point vortex. we also prove that in the different regimewhere the body shrinks with a fixed mass the limit dynamics is governed by asecond-order differential equation involving a kutta-joukowski-type lift force.
