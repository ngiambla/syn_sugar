we study the zero-viscosity limit of free boundary navier-stokes equationswith surface tension in $\mathbb{r}^3$ thus extending the work of masmoudi androusset [1] to take surface tension into account. due to the presence ofboundary layers, we are unable to pass to the zero-viscosity limit in the usualsobolev spaces. indeed, as viscosity tends to zero, normal derivatives at theboundary should blow-up. to deal with this problem, we solve the free boundaryproblem in the so-called sobolev co-normal spaces (after fixing the boundaryvia a coordinate transformation). we prove estimates which are uniform in theviscosity. and after inviscid limit process, we get the local existence offree-boundary euler equation with surface tension. one of the main differencesbetween this work and the work [1] is our use of time-derivative estimates andcertain properties of the dirichlet-neumann operator. in a forthcoming work, wediscuss how we can take the simultaneous limit of zero viscosity and surfacetension [].
