for any lie supergroup whose underlying lie group is reductive, we prove anextension of the casselman-wallach globalisation theorem: there is anequivalence between the category of harish-chandra modules and the category ofsf-representations (smooth fr\'echet representations of moderate growth) whosemodule of finite vectors is harish-chandra. as an application, we extend to liesupergroups a general general form of the gel'fand-kazhdan criterion due tosun-zhu.
