given a framed quiver, i.e. one with a frozen vertex associated to eachmutable vertex, there is a concept of green mutation, as introduced by keller.maximal sequences of such mutations, known as maximal green sequences, areimportant in representation theory and physics as they have numerousapplications, including the computations of spectrums of bps states,donaldson-thomas invariants, tilting of hearts in the derived category, andquantum dilogarithm identities. in this paper, we study such sequences andconstruct a maximal green sequence for every quiver mutation-equivalent to anorientation of a type a dynkin diagram.
