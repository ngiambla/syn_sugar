we propose an algorithm for solution of high-dimensional evolutionaryequations (odes and discretized time-dependent pdes) in the tensor train (tt)decomposition, assuming that the solution and the right-hand side of the odeadmit such a decomposition with a low storage. a linear ode, discretized viaone-step or chebyshev differentiation schemes, turns into a large linearsystem. the tensor decomposition allows to solve this system for several timepoints simultaneously using an extension of the alternating least squaresalgorithm. this method computes the tt approximation of the solution directly,without ever solving the original large problem, and encapsulates the galerkinmodel reduction of the ode. this allows an efficient estimation of the timediscretization error, and hence provides a way to adapt the time steps.besides, conservation laws can be preserved exactly in the reduced model byexpanding the approximation subspace with the generating vectors of the linearinvariants and correction of the euclidean norm. in numerical experiments withthe transport and the chemical master equations, we demonstrate that the newmethod is faster than traditional time stepping and stochastic simulationalgorithms, whereas the invariants are preserved up to the machine precisionirrespectively of the tt approximation accuracy.
