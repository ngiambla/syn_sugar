criteria for the existence of $t$-periodic solutions of nonautonomousparabolic equation $u_t = \delta u + f(t,x,u)$, $x\in\mathbb{r}^n$, $t>0$ withasymptotically linear $f$ will be provided. it is expressed in terms of timeaverage function $\hat f$ of the nonlinear term $f$ and the spectrum of thelaplace operator $\delta$ on $\mathbb{r}^n$. one of them says that if thederivative $\hat f_\infty$ of $\hat f$ at infinity does not interact with thespectrum of $\delta$, i.e. $\mathrm{ker} (-\delta + \hat f_\infty)=\{0\}$, thenthe parabolic equation admits a $t$-periodic solution. another theorem isderived in the situation, where the linearization at $0$ and infinity differtopologically, i.e. the total multiplicities of negative eigenvalues of theaveraged linearizations at $0$ and $\infty$ are different mod $2$.
