recent research has established both a theoretical basis and strong empiricalevidence that effective social behavior plays a beneficial role in themaintenance of physical and psychological well-being of people. to test whethersocial behavior and well-being are also associated in online communities, westudied the correlations between the recovery of patients with mental disordersand their behaviors in online social media. as the source of the data relatedto the social behavior and progress of mental recovery, we used patientslikeme(plm), the world's first open-participation research platform for thedevelopment of patient-centered health outcome measures. we first constructedan online social network structure based on patient-to-patient ties among 200patients obtained from plm. we then characterized patients' online socialactivities by measuring the numbers of "posts and views" and "helpful marks"each patient obtained. the patients' recovery data were obtained from theirself-reported status information that was also available on plm. we found thatsome node properties (in-degree, eigenvector centrality and pagerank) and thetwo online social activity measures were significantly correlated withpatients' recovery. furthermore, we re-collected the patients' recovery datatwo months after the first data collection. we found significant correlationsbetween the patients' social behaviors and the second recovery data, which werecollected two months apart. our results indicated that social interactions inonline communities such as plm were significantly associated with the currentand future recoveries of patients with mental disorders.
