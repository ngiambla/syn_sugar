for any affine variety equipped with coordinates, there is a surjective,continuous map from its berkovich space to its tropicalisation. exploitingtorus actions, we develop techniques for finding an explicit, continuoussection of this map. in particular, we prove that such a section exists forlinear spaces, grassmannians of planes (reproving a result due to cueto,h\"abich, and werner), matrix varieties defined by the vanishing of 3 times 3minors, and for the hypersurface defined by cayley's hyperdeterminant.
