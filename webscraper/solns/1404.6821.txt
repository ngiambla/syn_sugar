a graph $g$ is called $(a,b)$-choosable if for any list assignment $l$ whichassigns to each vertex $v$ a set $l(v)$ of $a$ permissible colours, there is a$b$-tuple $l$-colouring of $g$. an $(a,1)$-choosable graph is also called$a$-choosable. in the pioneering paper on list colouring of graphs byerd\h{o}s, rubin and taylor, $2$-choosable graphs are characterized. confirminga special case of a conjecture of erd\h{o}s--rubin--taylor, tuza and voigtproved that $2$-choosable graphs are $(2m,m)$-choosable for any positiveinteger $m$. on the other hand, voigt proved that if $m$ is an odd integer,then these are the only $(2m,m)$-choosable graphs; however, when $m$ is even,there are $(2m,m)$-choosable graphs that are not $2$-choosable. a graph iscalled $3$-choosable-critical if it is not $2$-choosable, but all its propersubgraphs are $2$-choosable. voigt conjectured that for every positive integer$m$, all bipartite $3$-choosable-critical graphs are $(4m,2m)$-choosable. inthis paper, we determine which $3$-choosable-critical graphs are$(4,2)$-choosable, refuting voigt's conjecture in the process. nevertheless, aweaker version of the conjecture is true: we prove that there is an eveninteger $k$ such that for any positive integer $m$, every bipartite$3$-choosable-critical graph is $(2km,km)$-choosable. moving beyond$3$-choosable-critical graphs, we present an infinite family ofnon-$3$-choosable-critical graphs which have been shown by computer analysis tobe $(4,2)$-choosable. this shows that the family of all $(4,2)$-choosablegraphs has rich structure.
