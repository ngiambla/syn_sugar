for any pair $m,n$ of von neumann algebras such that the algebraic tensorproduct $m\otimes n$ admits more than one $\mathrm{c}^*$-norm, the cardinal ofthe set of $\mathrm{c}^*$-norms is at least $ {2^{\aleph_0}}$. moreover thereis a family with cardinality $ {2^{\aleph_0}}$ of injective tensor productfunctors for $\mathrm{c}^*$-algebras in kirchberg's sense.  let $\ib=\prod_n m_{n}$. we also show that, for any non-nuclear von neumannalgebra $m\subset \ib(\ell_2)$, the set of $\mathrm{c}^*$-norms on $\ib \otimesm$ has cardinality equal to $2^{2^{\aleph_0}}$.
