in this paper, we describe the osculating cone to brill-noether loci$w^{0}_{d}(c)$ at smooth isolated points of $w^{1}_{d}(c)$ for a smoothcanonically embedded curve $c$ of even genus $g=2(d-1)$. in particular, we showthat the canonical curve $c$ is a component of the osculating cone. the proofis based on techniques introduced by george kempf in 1986.
