we study the problem of finding, in a real algebraic matrix group, the matrixclosest to a given data matrix. we do so from the algebro-geometric perspectiveof euclidean distance degrees. we recover several classical results; and amongthe new results that we prove is a formula for the euclidean distance degree ofspecial linear groups.
