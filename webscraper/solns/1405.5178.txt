we prove that $(\lambda_g\mapsto e^{-t|g|^r}\lambda_g)_{t>0}$ defines acompletely bounded semigroup of multipliers on the von neuman algebra ofhyperbolic groups for all real number $r$. one ingredient in the proof is theobservation that a construction of ozawa allows to characterize the radialmultipliers that are bounded on every hyperbolic graph, partially generalizingresults of haagerup--steenstrup--szwarc and wysocza\'nski. another ingredientis an upper estimate of trace class norms for hankel matrices, which is basedon peller's characterization of such norms.
