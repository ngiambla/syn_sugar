we prove a weyl-type subconvexity bound for the central value of the$l$-function of a hecke-maass form or a holomorphic hecke eigenform twisted bya quadratic dirichlet character, uniform in the archimedean parameter as wellas the twisting parameter. a similar hybrid bound holds for quadratic dirichlet$l$-functions, improving on a result of heath-brown.  as a consequence of these new bounds, we obtain explicit estimates for thenumber of heegner points of large odd discriminant in shrinking sets.
