we study the monoid generated by n-by-n distance matrices under tropical (ormin-plus) multiplication. using the tropical geometry of the orthogonal group,we prove that this monoid is a finite polyhedral fan of dimension n(n-1)/2, andwe compute the structure of this fan for n up to 5. the monoid captures gossipamong n gossipers over lossy phone lines, and contains the gossip monoid overordinary phone lines as a submonoid. we prove several new results about thissubmonoid, as well. in particular, we establish a sharp bound on chains ofcalls in each of which someone learns something new.
