we study the asymptotic quantization error of order $r$ for markov-typemeasures $\mu$ on a class of ratio-specified graph directed fractals. we showthat the quantization dimension of $\mu$ exists and determine its exact value$s_{r}$ in terms of spectral radius of a related matrix. we prove that the$s_{r}$-dimensional lower quantization coefficient of $\mu$ is always positive.moreover, inspired by mauldin-williams's work on the hausdorff measure of graphdirected fractals, we establish a necessary and sufficient condition for the$s_{r}$-dimensional upper quantization coefficient of $\mu$ to be finite.
