we describe the adjacency of vertices of the (unbounded version of the) setcovering polyhedron, in a similar way to the description given by chvatal forthe stable set polytope. we find a sufficient condition for adjacency, andcharacterize it with similar conditions in the case where the underlying matrixis row circular. we apply our findings to show a new infinite family ofminimally nonideal matrices.
