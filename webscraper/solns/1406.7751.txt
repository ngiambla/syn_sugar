  online socio-technical systems can be studied as proxy of the real world to
investigate human behavior and social interactions at scale. here we focus on
instagram, a media-sharing online platform whose popularity has been rising up
to gathering hundred millions users. instagram exhibits a mixture of features
including social structure, social tagging and media sharing. the network of
social interactions among users models various dynamics including
follower/followee relations and users' communication by means of
posts/comments. users can upload and tag media such as photos and pictures, and
they can "like" and comment each piece of information on the platform. in this
work we investigate three major aspects on our instagram dataset: (i) the
structural characteristics of its network of heterogeneous interactions, to
unveil the emergence of self organization and topically-induced community
structure; (ii) the dynamics of content production and consumption, to
understand how global trends and popular users emerge; (iii) the behavior of
users labeling media with tags, to determine how they devote their attention
and to explore the variety of their topical interests. our analysis provides
clues to understand human behavior dynamics on socio-technical systems,
specifically users and content popularity, the mechanisms of users'
interactions in online environments and how collective trends emerge from
individuals' topical interests.
