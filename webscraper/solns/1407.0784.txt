we study two impartial games introduced by anderson and harary and furtherdeveloped by barnes. both games are played by two players who alternatelyselect previously unselected elements of a finite group. the first player whobuilds a generating set from the jointly selected elements wins the first game.the first player who cannot select an element without building a generating setloses the second game. after the development of some general results, wedetermine the nim-numbers of these games for abelian and dihedral groups. wealso present some conjectures based on computer calculations. our maincomputational and theoretical tool is the structure diagram of a game, which isa type of identification digraph of the game digraph that is compatible withthe nim-numbers of the positions. structure diagrams also provide simple yetintuitive visualizations of these games that capture the complexity of thepositions.
