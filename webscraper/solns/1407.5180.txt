we give a characterization of linear canonoid transformations on symplecticmanifolds and we use it to generate bihamiltonian structures for somemechanical systems. utilizing this characterization we also study the behaviorof the harmonic oscillator under canonoid transformations. we present adescription of canonoid transformations due to e.t. whittaker, and we show thatit leads, in a natural way, to the modern, coordinate-independent definition ofcanonoid transformations. we also generalize canonoid transformations topoisson manifolds by introducing poissonoid transformations. we give examplesof such transformations for euler's equations of the rigid body (on$\mathcal{so}^\ast (3) $ and $ so^\ast (4)$) and for an integrable case ofkirchhoff's equations for the motion of a rigid body immersed in an idealfluid. we study the relationship between bihamiltonian structures andpoissonoid transformations for these examples. we analyze the link betweenpoissonoid transformations, constants of motion, and symmetries.
