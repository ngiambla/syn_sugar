let $b$ be a borel subgroup of a semisimple algebraic group $g$, and let$\mathfrak a$ be an abelian ideal of $\mathfrak b=lie(b)$. the ideal $\mathfraka$ is determined by certain subset $\delta_{\mathfrak a}$ of positive roots,and using $\delta_{\mathfrak a}$ we give an explicit classification of the$b$-orbits in $\mathfrak a$ and $\mathfrak a^*$. our description visiblydemonstrates that there are finitely many $b$-orbits in both cases. we alsodescribe the pyasetskii correspondence between the $b$-orbits in $\mathfrak a$and $\mathfrak a^*$ and the invariant algebras $\bbbk[\mathfrak a]^u$ and$\bbbk[\mathfrak a^*]^u$, where $u=(b,b)$. as an application, the number of$b$-orbits in the abelian nilradicals is computed. we also discuss relatedresults of a.melnikov and others for classical groups and state a generalconjecture on the closure and dimension of the $b$-orbits in the abeliannilradicals, which exploits a relationship between between $b$-orbits andinvolutions in the weyl group.
