we examine in detail the relative equilibria of the 4-vortex problem whenthree vortices have equal strength, that is, $\gamma_{1} = \gamma_{2} =\gamma_{3} = 1$, and $\gamma_{4}$ is a real parameter. we give the exact numberof relative equilibria and bifurcation values. we also study the relativeequilibria in the vortex rhombus problem.
