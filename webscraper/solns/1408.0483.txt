we give a topological realization of the (spherical) double affine heckealgebra $\mathrm{sh}_{q,t}$ of type $a_1$, and we use this to construct amodule over $\mathrm{sh}_{q,t}$ for any knot $k \subset s^3$. as anapplication, we give a purely topological interpretation of cherednik's2-variable polynomials $p_n(r,s; q,t)$ of type $a_1$ from [che13] (where $r,s\in \mathbb{z}$ are relatively prime), and we give a new proof that thesespecialize to the colored jones polynomials of the $r,s$ torus knot.  we then generalize cherednik's construction (for $\mathcal{sl}_2$) to alliterated cables of the unknot and prove the corresponding specializationproperty. finally, in the appendix we compare our polynomials associated toiterated torus knots to the ones recently defined in [cd14], in thespecialization $t=-q^2$.
