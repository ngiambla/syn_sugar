motivated by the many potential applications of low-rank multi-way tensorapproximations, we set out to count the rank-one tensors that are criticalpoints of the distance function to a general tensor v. as this count depends onv, we average over v drawn from a gaussian distribution, and find formulas thatrelates this average to problems in random matrix theory.
