we look at the rank generating function $g_\lambda$ of partitions inside theferrers diagram of some partition $\lambda$, investigated by stanton in 1990,as well as a closely related problem investigated by stanley and zanello in2013. we show that $g_\lambda$ is not unimodal for a larger class of 4-partpartitions than previously known, and also that if the ratios of parts of$\lambda$ are close enough to 1 (depending on how many parts $\lambda$ has), orif the first part is at least half the size of $\lambda$, then $g_\lambda$ isunimodal.
