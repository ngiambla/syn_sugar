given a sequence of random variables ${\bf x}=x_1,x_2,\ldots$ suppose the aimis to maximize one's return by picking a `favorable' $x_i$. obviously, theexpected payoff crucially depends on the information at hand. an optimallyinformed person knows all the values $x_i=x_i$ and thus receives $e (\supx_i)$. we will compare this return to the expected payoffs of a number ofobservers having less information, in particular $\sup_i (ex_i)$, the value ofthe sequence to a person who only knows the first moments of the randomvariables.  in general, there is a stochastic environment (i.e. a class of randomvariables $\cal c$), and several levels of information. given some ${\bf x} \in{\cal c}$, an observer possessing information $j$ obtains $r_j({\bf x})$. weare going to study `information sets' of the form $$ r_{\cal c}^{j,k} = \{(x,y) | x = r_j({\bf x}), y=r_k({\bf x}), {\bf x} \in {\cal c} \}, $$characterizing the advantage of $k$ relative to $j$. since such a set measuresthe additional payoff by virtue of increased information, its analysis yields anumber of interesting results, in particular `prophet-type' inequalities.
