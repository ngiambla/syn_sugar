in a spirit of givental's constructions batyrev, ciocan-fontanine, kim, andvan straten suggested landau--ginzburg models for smooth fano completeintersections in grassmannians and partial flag varieties as certain completeintersections in complex tori equipped with special functions calledsuperpotentials. we provide a particular algorithm for constructing birationalisomorphisms of these models for complete intersections in grassmannians ofplanes with complex tori. in this case the superpotentials are given by laurentpolynomials. we study givental's integrals for landau--ginzburg modelssuggested by batyrev, ciocan-fontanine, kim, and van straten and show that theyare periods for pencils of fibers of maps provided by laurent polynomials weobtain. the algorithm we provide after minor modifications can be applied in amore general context.
