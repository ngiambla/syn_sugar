we show local existence and uniqueness of plasma(fluid)-vaccum free boundaryproblem of magnetohydrodynamic flow in three-dimensional space with infinitedepth setting when magnetic field is zero on the free boundary. we usesobolev-slobodetskii space which was used in usual free boundary problem in[3,5,6,7,8,9]. we also show that this solution can be extended as long as wewant for sufficiently small initial data. using the result of this paper wewill get a unique solution of (kinematic inviscid) - (magnetic non diffusive)free boundary magnetohydrodynamics problem via (kinematic viscosity) -(magnetic diffusivity) limit in [10].
