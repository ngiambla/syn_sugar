the present work provides a theoretical explanation for the quantisation ofelectric charges, an open problem since millikan's oil drop experiment in 1909.this explanation is based solely on maxwell's theory, it recastselectromagnetic theory under the language of complex line bundles; therefore,neither magnetic poles nor quantum mechanics are invoked. the existence ofmagnetic poles was essentially the only theoretical explanation for chargequantisation (e.g. dirac's magnetic pole), and there is no experimental datasupporting their existence.
