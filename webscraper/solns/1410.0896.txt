in this article, we deal with the structure of the spherical hall algebra ofcoherent sheaves with parabolic structures on a smooth projective curve ofarbitrary genus. we provide a shuffle-like presentation of the vector bundlepart and show the existence of the generic form. we also prove that thespherical hall algebra contains the characteristic functions on all theharder-narasimhan strata. these results together imply schiffmann's theorem onthe existence of kac polynomials for quasi-parabolic vector bundles of fixedrank and multi-degree over the curve. on the other hand, the shuffle structurewe obtained is new and we make links to the representations of quantum affinealgebras of type a.
