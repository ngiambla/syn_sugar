given a log canonical pair $(x, \delta)$, we show that $k_x+\delta$ is nefassuming there is no non constant map from the affine line with values in theopen strata of the stratification induced by the non-klt locus of $\delta$.this implies a generalization of the cone theorem. moreover, we give acriterion of nakai type to determine when under the above condition$k_x+\delta$ is ample and we prove some partial results in the case ofarbitrary singularities.
