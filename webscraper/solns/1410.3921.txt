let $x$ be a proper, geodesically complete cat(0) space under a proper,non-elementary, isometric action by a group $\gamma$ with a rank one element.we construct a generalized bowen-margulis measure on the space of unit-speedparametrized geodesics of $x$ modulo the $\gamma$-action.  although the construction of bowen-margulis measures for rank onenonpositively curved manifolds and for cat(-1) spaces is well-known, theconstruction for cat(0) spaces hinges on establishing a new structural resultof independent interest: almost no geodesic, under the bowen-margulis measure,bounds a flat strip of any positive width. we also show that almost every pointin $\partial_\infty x$, under the patterson-sullivan measure, is isolated inthe tits metric. (for these results we assume the bowen-margulis measure isfinite, as it is in the cocompact case).  finally, we precisely characterize mixing when $x$ has full limit set: afinite bowen-margulis measure is not mixing under the geodesic flow preciselywhen $x$ is a tree with all edge lengths in $c \mathbb z$ for some $c > 0$.this characterization is new, even in the setting of cat(-1) spaces.  more general (technical) versions of these results are also stated in thepaper.
