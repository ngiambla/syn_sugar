  i examine the topic of training scientific generalists. to focus the
discussion, i propose the creation of a new graduate program, analogous in
structure to existing md/phd programs, aimed at training a critical mass of
scientific researchers with substantial intellectual breadth. in addition to
completing the normal requirements for a phd, students would undergo an
intense, several year training period designed to expose them to the core
vocabulary of multiple subjects at the graduate level. after providing some
historical and philosophical context for this proposal, i outline how such a
program could be implemented with little institutional overhead by existing
research universities. finally, i discuss alternative possibilities for
training generalists by taking advantage of contemporary developments in online
learning and open science.
