suppose $g$ is a compact lie group, $h$ is a closed subgroup of $g$, and thehomogeneous space $g/h$ is connected. the paper investigates the ricci flow ona manifold $m$ diffeomorphic to $[0,1]\times g/h$. first, we prove a short-timeexistence and uniqueness theorem for a $g$-invariant solution $g(t)$ satisfyingthe boundary condition $\mathop{\mathrm{ii}}(g(t))=f(t,g_{\partial m}(t))$ andthe initial condition $g(0)=\hat g$. here, $\mathop{\mathrm{ii}}(g(t))$ is thesecond fundamental form of $\partial m$, $g_{\partial m}$ is the metric inducedon $\partial m$ by $g(t)$, $f$ is a smooth map and $\hat g$ is a metric on $m$.second, we study perelman's $\mathcal f$-functional on $m$. our results show,roughly speaking, that $\mathcal f$ is non-decreasing on a $g$-invariantsolution to the modified ricci flow, provided that this solution satisfiesboundary conditions inspired by the 2012 paper of gianniotis.
