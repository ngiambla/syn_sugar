we consider the measure-geometric laplacians $\delta^{\mu}$ with respect toatomless compactly supported borel probability measures $\mu$ as introduced byfreiberg and z\"ahle in 2002 and show that the harmonic calculus of$\delta^{\mu}$ can be deduced from the classical (weak) laplacian. weexplicitly calculate the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of $\delta^{\mu}$.further, it is shown that there exists a measure-geometric laplacian whoseeigenfunctions are the chebyshev polynomials and illustrate our results throughspecific examples of fractal measures, namely salem and inhomogeneousself-similar cantor measures.
