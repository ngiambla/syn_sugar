following previous work of the second author, we establish more properties ofgroups of circle homeomorphisms which admit invariant laminations. a certaintype of such groups---so-called pseudo-fibered groups---have previously beenconjectured to be closely related to fundamental groups of closed hyperbolic3-manifolds. we clarify this conjecture, and explain the necessity of variousconditions. we then prove that torsion-free pseudo-fibered groups satisfy atits alternative. we conclude by proving that a purely hyperbolicpseudo-fibered group acts on the 2-sphere as a convergence group. this leads toa conjectural characterization of the fundamental group of a fibered hyperbolic3-manifold as a pseudo-fibered group with some additional properties.
