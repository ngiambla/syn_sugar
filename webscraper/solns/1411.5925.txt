one of the most fundamental problems in markov decision processes is analysisand control synthesis for safety and reachability specifications. we considerthe stochastic reach-avoid problem, in which the objective is to synthesize acontrol policy to maximize the probability of reaching a target set at a giventime, while staying in a safe set at all prior times. we characterize thesolution to this problem through an infinite dimensional linear program. wethen develop a tractable approximation to the infinite dimensional linearprogram through finite dimensional approximations of the decision space andconstraints. for a large class of markov decision processes modeled by gaussianmixtures kernels we show that through a proper selection of the finitedimensional space, one can further reduce the computational complexity of theresulting linear program. we validate the proposed method and analyze itspotential with a series of numerical case studies.
