we give a proof of the khintchine inequalities in non-commutative$l_p$-spaces for all $0< p<1$. these new inequalities are valid for therademacher functions or gaussian random variables, but also for more generalsequences, e.g. for the analogues of such random variables in free probability.we also prove a factorization for operators from a hilbert space to a noncommutative $l_p$-space, which is new for $0<p<1$. we end by showing that mazurmaps are h\"older on semifinite von neumann algebras. the main tool is a newform of h\"older inequality for non commutative lp spaces with weights.
