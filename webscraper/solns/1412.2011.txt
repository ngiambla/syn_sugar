variational integrators for lagrangian dynamical systems provide a systematicway to derive geometric numerical methods. these methods preserve a discretemultisymplectic form as well as momenta associated to symmetries of thelagrangian via noether's theorem. an inevitable prerequisite for the derivationof variational integrators is the existence of a variational formulation forthe considered problem. even though for a large class of systems thisrequirement is fulfilled, there are many interesting examples which do notbelong to this class, e.g., equations of advection-diffusion type frequentlyencountered in fluid dynamics or plasma physics. on the other hand, it isalways possible to embed an arbitrary dynamical system into a larger lagrangiansystem using the method of formal (or adjoint) lagrangians. we investigate theapplication of the variational integrator method to formal lagrangians, andthereby extend the application domain of variational integrators to includepotentially all dynamical systems. the theory is supported by physicallyrelevant examples, such as the advection equation and the vorticity equation,and numerically verified. remarkably, the integrator for the vorticity equationcombines arakawa's discretisation of the poisson brackets with a symplectictime stepping scheme in a fully covariant way such that the discrete energy isexactly preserved. in the presentation of the results, we try to make thegeometric framework of variational integrators accessible to non specialists.
