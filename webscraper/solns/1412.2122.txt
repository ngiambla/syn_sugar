  in this paper we present a non-invasive ambient intelligence framework for
the semi-automatic analysis of non-verbal communication applied to the
restorative justice field. in particular, we propose the use of computer vision
and social signal processing technologies in real scenarios of victim-offender
mediations, applying feature extraction techniques to multi-modal
audio-rgb-depth data. we compute a set of behavioral indicators that define
communicative cues from the fields of psychology and observational methodology.
we test our methodology on data captured in real world victim-offender
mediation sessions in catalonia in collaboration with the regional government.
we define the ground truth based on expert opinions when annotating the
observed social responses. using different state-of-the-art binary
classification approaches, our system achieves recognition accuracies of 86%
when predicting satisfaction, and 79% when predicting both agreement and
receptivity. applying a regression strategy, we obtain a mean deviation for the
predictions between 0.5 and 0.7 in the range [1-5] for the computed social
signals.
