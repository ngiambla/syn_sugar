the paper describes gamification, virality and retention in the freemiumeducational online platform with 40,000 users as an example. relationshipsbetween virality and retention parameters as measurable metrics are calculatedand discussed using real examples. virality and monetization can be bothcompeting and complementary mechanisms for the system growth. the k-growthfactor, which combines both virality and retention, is proposed as the metricsof the overall freemium system performance in terms of the user base growth.this approach can be tested using a small number of users to assess the systempotential performance. if the k-growth factor is less than one, the productneeds further development. if the k-growth factor it is greater than one, thesystem retains existing and attracts new users, thus a large scale marketlaunch can be successful.
