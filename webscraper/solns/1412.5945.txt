within this chapter (published as [49]) we introduce the overall idea of thealgebraic formalism of qft on a fixed globally hyperbolic spacetime in theframework of unital $*$-algebras. we point out some general features of ccralgebras, such as simplicity and the construction of symmetry-inducedhomomorphisms. for simplicity, we deal only with a real scalar quantum field.we discuss some known general results in curved spacetime like the existence ofquasifree states enjoying symmetries induced from the background, pointing outthe relevant original references. we introduce, in particular, the notion of ahadamard quasifree algebraic quantum state, both in the geometric andmicrolocal formulation, and the associated notion of wick polynomials.
