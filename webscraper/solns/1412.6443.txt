we study the bifurcations of central configurations of the newtonianfour-body problem when some of the masses are equal. first, we continuenumerically the solutions for the equal mass case, and we find values of themass parameter at which the number of solutions changes. then, using thekrawczyk method and some result of equivariant bifurcation theory, werigorously prove the existence of such bifurcations and classify them.
