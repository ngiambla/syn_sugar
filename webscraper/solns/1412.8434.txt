we propose new concepts of statistical depth, multivariate quantiles, ranksand signs, based on canonical transportation maps between a distribution ofinterest on $r^d$ and a reference distribution on the $d$-dimensional unitball. the new depth concept, called monge-kantorovich depth, specializes tohalfspace depth in the case of spherical distributions, but, for more generaldistributions, differs from the latter in the ability for its contours toaccount for non convex features of the distribution of interest. we proposeempirical counterparts to the population versions of those monge-kantorovichdepth contours, quantiles, ranks and signs, and show their consistency byestablishing a uniform convergence property for empirical transport maps, whichis of independent interest.
