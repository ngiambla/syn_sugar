we give an overview on the quantization problem for fractal measures,including some related results and methods which have been developed in thelast decades. based on the work of graf and luschgy, we propose a three-stepprocedure to estimate the quantization errors. we survey some recent progress,which makes use of this procedure, including the quantization for self-affinemeasures, markov-type measures on graph-directed fractals, and product measureson multiscale moran sets. several open problems are mentioned.
