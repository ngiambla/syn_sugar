we study the stable hom relation for cohen-macaulay modules over gorensteinlocal algebras. we give the sufficient condition to make the stable homrelation a partial order when the base algebra is of finite representationtype. as an application, we give the description of stable degenerations ofcohen-macaulay modules over simple singularities of several types by using thestable hom relation.
