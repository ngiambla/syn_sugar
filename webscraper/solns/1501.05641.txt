iterated integrals of paths arise frequently in the study of the taylor'sexpansion for controlled differential equations. we will prove a factorialdecay estimate, conjectured by m. gubinelli, for the iterated integrals ofnon-geometric rough paths. we will explain, with a counter example, why theconventional approach of using the neoclassical inequality fails. our proofinvolves a concavity estimate for sums over rooted trees and a non-trivialextension of t. lyons' proof in 1994 for the factorial decay of iteratedyoung's integrals.
