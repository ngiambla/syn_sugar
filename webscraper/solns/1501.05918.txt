the duflo map is a valuable tool for operator ordering in contexts in whichkirillov-kostant brackets and their quantizations play a role. a priori, theduflo map is only defined on the subspace of the symmetric algebra over a liealgebra consisting of elements invariant under the adjoint action. here wediscuss extensions to the whole symmetric algebra, as well as their applicationto the calculation of chern-simons theory expectation values.
