we consider an interacting system of one-dimensional structures modellingfibers with fiber-fiber interaction in a fiber lay-down process. the resultingmicroscopic system is investigated by looking at different asymptotic limits ofthe corresponding stochastic model. equations arising from mean-field anddiffusion limits are considered. furthermore, numerical methods for thestochastic system and its mean-field counterpart are discussed. a numericalcomparison of solutions corresponding to the different scales (microscopic,mesoscopic and macroscopic) is included.
