electricity market mechanisms designed to steer sustainable generation ofelectricity play an important role for the energy transition intended tomitigate climate change. one of the major problems is to complement volatilerenewable energy sources by operationally flexible capacity reserves. in thispaper a proposal is given to determine prices on electricity markets takinginto account the operational flexibility of power plants, such that the costsof long-term capacity reserves can be paid by short-term electricity spotmarkets. for this purpose, a measure of operational flexibility is introducedenabling to compute an inflexibility fee charging each individual power planton a wholesale electricity spot market. the total sum of inflexibility feesaccumulated on the spot markets then can be used to finance a capacity marketkeeping the necessary reserves to warrant grid reliability. here each reservepower plant then gets a reliability payment depending on its operationalflexibility. the proposal is applied to a small exemplary grid, illustratingits main idea and also revealing the caveat that too high fees paradoxicallycould create incentives to employ highly flexible power plants on the spotmarket rather than to run them as backup capacity.
