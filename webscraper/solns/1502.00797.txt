  the internet of things, or the iot is a vision for a ubiquitous society
wherein people and "things" are connected in an immersively networked computing
environment, with the connected "things" providing utility to
people/enterprises and their digital shadows, through intelligent social and
commercial services. translating this idea to a conceivable reality is a work
in progress for more than a decade. current iot architectures are predicated on
optimistic assumptions on the evolution and deployment of iot technologies. we
believe many of these assumptions will not be met, consequently impeding the
practical and sustainable deployment of iot. in this article, we explore
use-cases across different applications domains that can potentially benefit
from an iot infrastructure, and analyze them in the context of an alternative
world-view that is more grounded in reality. despite this more conservative
approach, we argue that adopting certain design paradigms when architecting an
iot ecosystem can achieve much of the promised benefits in a practical and
sustainable manner.
