the skew mean curvature flow(smcf), which origins from the study of fluiddynamics, describes the evolution of a codimension two submanifold along itsbinormal direction. we study the basic properties of the smcf and prove theexistence of a short-time solution to the initial value problem of the smcf ofcompact surfaces in euclidean space $\mathbb{r}^4$. a sobolev-type embeddingtheorem for the second fundamental forms of two dimensional surfaces is alsoproved, which might be of independent interest.
