the oort conjecture (now a theorem of obus-wewers and pop) states that if kis an algebraically closed field of characteristic p, then any cyclic branchedcover of smooth projective k-curves lifts to characteristic zero. this isequivalent to the local oort conjecture, which states that all cyclicextensions of k[[t]] lift to characteristic zero. we generalize the local oortconjecture to the case of galois extensions with cyclic p-sylow subgroups,reduce the conjecture to a pure characteristic p statement, and prove it inseveral cases. in particular, we show that d_9 is a so-called local oort group.
