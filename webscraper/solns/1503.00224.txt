we use the theory of $\textbf{u}_q$-tilting modules to construct cellularbases for centralizer algebras. our methods are quite general and work for anyquantum group $\textbf{u}_q$ attached to a cartan matrix and include thenon-semisimple cases for $q$ being a root of unity and ground fields ofpositive characteristic. our approach also generalizes to certain categoriescontaining infinite-dimensional modules. as applications, we give a newsemisimplicty criterion for centralizer algebras, and recover the cellularityof several known algebras (with partially new cellular bases) which all fitinto our general setup.
