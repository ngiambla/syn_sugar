we present a rigorous mathematical treatment of ruppeiner geometry, byconsidering degenerate hessian metrics defined on radiant manifolds. a manifold$m$ is said to be radiant if it is endowed with a symmetric, flat connection$\bar\nabla$ and a global vector field $\rho$ whose covariant derivative is theidentity mapping. a degenerate hessian metric on $m$ is a degenerate metrictensor $g$ that can locally be written as the covariant hessian of a function,called potential. a function on $m$ is said to be extensive if its liederivative with respect to $\rho$ is the function itself. we show that thehessian metrics appearing in equilibrium thermodynamics are necessarilydegenerate, owing to the fact that their potentials are extensive (up to anadditive constant). manifolds having degenerate hessian metrics always containembedded hessian submanifolds, which generalize the manifolds defined byconstant volume in which ruppeiner geometry is usually studied. by means ofexamples, we illustrate that linking scalar curvature to microscopicinteractions within a thermodynamic system is inaccurate under this approach.in contrast, thermodynamic critical points seem to arise as geometricsingularities.
