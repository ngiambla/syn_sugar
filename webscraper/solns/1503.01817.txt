  we present the yahoo flickr creative commons 100 million dataset (yfcc100m),
the largest public multimedia collection that has ever been released. the
dataset contains a total of 100 million media objects, of which approximately
99.2 million are photos and 0.8 million are videos, all of which carry a
creative commons license. each media object in the dataset is represented by
several pieces of metadata, e.g. flickr identifier, owner name, camera, title,
tags, geo, media source. the collection provides a comprehensive snapshot of
how photos and videos were taken, described, and shared over the years, from
the inception of flickr in 2004 until early 2014. in this article we explain
the rationale behind its creation, as well as the implications the dataset has
for science, research, engineering, and development. we further present several
new challenges in multimedia research that can now be expanded upon with our
dataset.
