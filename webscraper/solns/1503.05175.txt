we study convergence of return- and hitting-time distributions of small sets$e_{k}$ with $\mu(e_{k})\rightarrow0$ in recurrent ergodic dynamical systemspreserving an infinite measure $\mu$. some properties which are easy in finitemeasure situations break down in this null-recurrent setup. however, in thepresence of a uniform set $y$ with regularly varying wandering rate there is ascaling function suitable for all subsets of $y$. in this case, we show thatreturn distributions for the $e_{k}$ converge iff the corresponding hittingtime distributions do, and we derive an explicit relation between the two limitlaws. some consequences of this result are discussed. in particular, this leadsto improved sufficient conditions for convergence to $\mathcal{e}%^{\frac{1}{\alpha}}\,\mathcal{g}_{\alpha}$, where $\mathcal{e}$ and$\mathcal{g}_{\alpha}$ are independent random variables, with $\mathcal{e}$exponentially distributed and $\mathcal{g}_{\alpha}$ following the one-sidedstable law of order $\alpha$. the same principle also reveals the limit laws(different from the above) which occur at hyperbolic periodic points ofprototypical null-recurrent interval maps
