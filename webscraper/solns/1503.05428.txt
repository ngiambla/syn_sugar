we will introduce an $\mathbb{n}$-filtration on the negative part of aquantum group of type $a_n$, such that the associated graded algebra is aq-commutative polynomial algebra. this filtration is given in terms of therepresentation theory of quivers, by realizing the quantum group as the hallalgebra of a quiver. we show that the induced associated graded module of anysimple finite-dimensional module (of type 1) is isomorphic to a quotient ofthis polynomial algebra by a monomial ideal, and we provide a monomial basisfor this associated graded module. this construction can be viewed as a quantumanalog of the classical pbw framework, and in fact, by considering theclassical limit, this basis is the monomial basis provided by feigin,littelmann and the second author in the classical setup.
