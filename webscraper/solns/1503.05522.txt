  we live in a global village where electronic communication has eliminated the
geographical barriers of information exchange. the road is now open to
worldwide convergence of information interests, shared values, and
understanding. nevertheless, interests still vary between countries around the
world. this raises important questions about what today's world map of in-
formation interests actually looks like and what factors cause the barriers of
information exchange between countries. to quantitatively construct a world map
of information interests, we devise a scalable statistical model that
identifies countries with similar information interests and measures the
countries' bilateral similarities. from the similarities we connect countries
in a global network and find that countries can be mapped into 18 clusters with
similar information interests. through regression we find that language and
religion best explain the strength of the bilateral ties and formation of
clusters. our findings provide a quantitative basis for further studies to
better understand the complex interplay between shared interests and conflict
on a global scale. the methodology can also be extended to track changes over
time and capture important trends in global information exchange.
