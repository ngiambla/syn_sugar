different ways of implementing dimension-by-dimension cweno reconstructionare discussed and the most efficient method is applied to develop a fourthorder central scheme for multi-dimensional hyperbolic problems. fourth orderaccuracy and shock capturing nature of the scheme are demonstrated in variousnonlinear multi-dimensional problems. in order to show the overall performanceof the present central scheme numerical errors and non-oscillatory behavior arecompared with existing multi-dimensional cweno based central schemes forvarious multi-dimensional problems. moreover, the benefits of the presentfourth order central scheme over third order implementation are shown bycomparing the numerical dissipation and computational cost between the two.
