let $\pi$ be a finite dimensional unitary representation of a group $g$ witha generating symmetric $n$-element set $s\subset g$. fix $\vp>0$. assume thatthe spectrum of $|s|^{-1}\sum_{s\in s} \pi(s) \otimes \overline{\pi(s)}$ isincluded in $ [-1, 1-\vp]$ (so there is a spectral gap $\ge \vp$). let$r'_n(\pi)$ be the number of distinct irreducible representations of dimension$\le n$ that appear in $\pi$. then let $r_{n,\vp}'(n)=\sup r'_n(\pi)$ where thesupremum runs over all $\pi$ with ${n,\vp}$ fixed. we prove that there arepositive constants $\delta_\vp$ and $c_\vp$ such that, for all sufficientlylarge integer $n$ (i.e. $n\ge n_0$ with $n_0$ depending on $\vp$) and for all$n\ge 1$, we have $\exp{\delta_\vp nn^2} \le r'_{n,\vp}(n)\le \exp{c_\vpnn^2}$. the same bounds hold if, in $r'_n(\pi)$, we count only the number ofdistinct irreducible representations of dimension exactly $= n$.
