the higher-order orthogonality iteration (hooi) has been popularly used forfinding a best low-multilinear-rank approximation of a tensor. however, itsiterate sequence convergence is still an open question. in this paper, we firstanalyze a greedy hooi, which updates each factor matrix by selecting from thebest candidates one that is closest to the current iterate. assuming theexistence of a block-nondegenerate limit point, we establish its globalconvergence through the so-called kurdyka-lojasiewicz (kl) property. inaddition, we show that if the starting point is sufficiently close to anyblock-nondegenerate globally optimal solution, the greedy hooi produces asequence convergent to a globally optimal solution. relating the iteratesequence by the original hooi to that by the greedy hooi, we then show that thesame convergence results hold for the original hooi and thus positively addressthe open question.
