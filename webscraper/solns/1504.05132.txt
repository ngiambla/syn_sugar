the mixing boundary-value problem for infinite one-dimensional chain ofharmonic oscillators on the half-line is considered. the large time asymptoticbehavior of solutions is obtained. the initial data of the system are supposedto be a random function which has some mixing properties. we study thedistribution $\mu_t$ of the random solution at time moments $t\in\mathbb{r}$.the main result is the convergence of $\mu_t$ to a gaussian probability measureas $t\to\infty$. the mixing properties of the limit measures are studied.
