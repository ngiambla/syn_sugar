  smartphones have become an indispensable part of our daily life. their
improved sensing and computing capabilities bring new opportunities for human
behavior monitoring and analysis. most work so far has been focused on
detecting correlation rather than causation among features extracted from
smartphone data. however, pure correlation analysis does not offer sufficient
understanding of human behavior. moreover, causation analysis could allow
scientists to identify factors that have a causal effect on health and
well-being issues, such as obesity, stress, depression and so on and suggest
actions to deal with them. finally, detecting causal relationships in this kind
of observational data is challenging since, in general, subjects cannot be
randomly exposed to an event.
  in this article, we discuss the design, implementation and evaluation of a
generic quasi-experimental framework for conducting causation studies on human
behavior from smartphone data. we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach
by investigating the causal impact of several factors such as exercise, social
interactions and work on stress level. our results indicate that exercising and
spending time outside home and working environment have a positive effect on
participants stress level while reduced working hours only slightly impact
stress.
