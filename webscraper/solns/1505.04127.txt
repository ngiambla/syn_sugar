in this paper, we introduce a model describing the dynamic of vesiclemembranes within an incompressible viscous fluid in $3d$ domains. the systemconsists of the navier-stokes equations, with an extra stress tensor dependingon the membrane, coupled with a cahn-hilliard phase-field equation associatedto a bending energy plus a penalization term related to the area conservation.this problem has a dissipative in time free-energy which leads, in particular,to prove the existence of global in time weak solutions. we analyze thelarge-time behavior of the weak solutions. by using a modifiedlojasiewicz-simon's result, we prove the convergence as time goes to infinityof each (whole) trajectory to a single equilibrium. finally, the convergence ofthe trajectory of the phase is improved by imposing more regularity on thedomain and initial phase.
