we associate a half-integer number, called {\em the quantum index}, toalgebraic curves in the real plane satisfying to certain conditions. the areaencompassed by the logarithmic image of such curves is equal to $\pi^2$ timesthe quantum index of the curve and thus has a discrete spectrum of values. weuse the quantum index to refine real enumerative geometry in a way consistentwith the block-g\"ottsche invariants from tropical enumerative geometry.
