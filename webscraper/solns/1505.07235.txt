let $c\subset \mathbb{p}^{g-1}$ be a general curve of genus $g$ and let $k$be a positive integer such that the brill-noether number $\rho(g,k,1)\geq 0$and $g > k+1$. the aim of this short note is to study the relative canonicalresolution of $c$ on a rational normal scroll swept out by a $g^1_k=|l|$ with$l\in w^1_k(c)$ general. we show that the bundle of quadrics appearing in therelative canonical resolution is unbalanced if and only if $\rho>0$ and$(k-\rho-\frac{7}{2})^2-2k+\frac{23}{4}>0$.
