we develop the theory of layered posets, and use the notion of layering toprove a new iteration theorem (theorem 6): if $\kappa$ is weakly compact thenany universal kunen iteration of $\kappa$-cc posets (each possibly of size$\kappa$) is $\kappa$-cc, as long as direct limits are used sufficiently often.this iteration theorem simplifies and generalizes the various chain conditionarguments for universal kunen iterations in the literature on saturated ideals,especially in situations where finite support iterations are not possible. wealso provide two applications: (1) for any $n \ge 1$, a wide variety of$<\omega_{n-1}$-closed, $\omega_{n+1}$-cc posets of size $\omega_{n+1}$ canconsistently be absorbed (as regular suborders) by quotients of saturatedideals on $\omega_n$ (see theorem 7 and corollary 8); and (2) for any $n \in\omega$, the tree property at $\omega_{n+3}$ is consistent with the chang'sconjecture $(\omega_{n+3}, \omega_{n+1}) \twoheadrightarrow (\omega_{n+1},\omega_n)$ (theorem 9).
