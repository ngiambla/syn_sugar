the characterization of the covariance function of the solution process to astochastic partial differential equation is considered in the parabolic casewith multiplicative l\'evy noise of affine type. for the second moment of themild solution, a well-posed deterministic space-time variational problem posedon projective and injective tensor product spaces is derived, whichsubsequently leads to a deterministic equation for the covariance function.
