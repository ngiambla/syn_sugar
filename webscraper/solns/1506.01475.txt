we prove the theorem stated in the title. more precisely, we show thestronger statement that every symmetric monoidal left adjoint functor betweenpresentably symmetric monoidal infinity-categories is represented by a strongsymmetric monoidal left quillen functor between simplicial, combinatorial andleft proper symmetric monoidal model categories.
