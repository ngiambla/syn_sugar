this paper studies a partial order on the general linear group gl(v) calledthe absolute order, derived from viewing gl(v) as a group generated byreflections, that is, elements whose fixed space has codimension one. theabsolute order on gl(v) is shown to have two equivalent descriptions, one viaadditivity of length for factorizations into reflections, the other viaadditivity of fixed space codimensions. other general properties of the orderare derived, including self-duality of its intervals.  working over a finite field f_q, it is shown via a complex charactercomputation that the poset interval from the identity to a singer cycle (or anyregular elliptic element) in gl_n(f_q) has a strikingly simple formula for thenumber of chains passing through a prescribed set of ranks.
