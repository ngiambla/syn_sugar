we consider stochastic differential systems driven by continuoussemimartingales and governed by non-commuting vector fields. we prove that thelogarithm of the flowmap is an exponential lie series. this relies on a naturalchange of basis to vector fields for the associated quadratic covariationprocesses, analogous to stratonovich corrections. the flowmap can then beexpanded as a series in compositional powers of vector fields and the logaritmof the flowmap can thus be expanded in the lie algebra of vector fields.further, we give a direct self-contained proof of the correspondingchen-strichartz formula which provides an explicit formula for the lie seriescoefficients. such exponential lie series are important in the development ofstrong lie group integration schemes that ensure approximate solutionsthemselves lie in any homogeneous manifold on which the solution evolves.
