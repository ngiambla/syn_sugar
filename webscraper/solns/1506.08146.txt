we study a general class of quadratic bsdes with terminal value in lp for p >1. first of all, we give an lp-type estimate and existence result. under theadditional assumption of monotonicity and convexity, we derive the comparisontheorem, uniqueness and stability result via {\theta}-technique (briand and hu[7]). the assumptions employed throughout this paper are rather weak and extendthe quadratic bsde literature. finally, a probabilistic representation for theviscosity solution to the associated quadratic pdes is given.
