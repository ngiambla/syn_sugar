bi-hamiltonian structures are of great importance in the theory of integrablehamiltonian systems. the notion of compatibility of symplectic structures is akey aspect of bi-hamiltonian systems. because of this, a few different notionsof compatibility have been introduced. in this paper we show that, under someadditional assumptions, compatibility in the sense of magri implies a notion ofcompatibility due to fass\`o and ratiu, that we dub bi-affine compatibility. wepresent two proofs of this fact. the first one uses the uniqueness of theconnection parallelizing all the hamiltonian vector fields tangent to theleaves of a lagrangian foliation. the second proof uses darboux-nijenhuiscoordinates and symplectic connections.
