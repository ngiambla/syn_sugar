  this paper presents a financial analysis over twitter sentiment analytics
extracted from listed retail brands. we investigate whether there is
statistically-significant information between the twitter sentiment and volume,
and stock returns and volatility. traditional newswires are also considered as
a proxy for the market sentiment for comparative purpose. the results suggest
that social media is indeed a valuable source in the analysis of the financial
dynamics in the retail sector even when compared to mainstream news such as the
wall street journal and dow jones newswires.
