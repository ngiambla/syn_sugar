consider an $n \times p$ data matrix $x$ whose rows are independently sampledfrom a population with covariance $\sigma$. when $n,p$ are both large, theeigenvalues of the sample covariance matrix are substantially different fromthose of the true covariance. asymptotically, as $n,p \to \infty$ with $p/n \to\gamma$, there is a deterministic mapping from the population spectraldistribution (psd) to the empirical spectral distribution (esd) of theeigenvalues. the mapping is characterized by a fixed-point equation for thestieltjes transform.  we propose a new method to compute numerically the output esd from anarbitrary input psd. our method, called spectrode, finds the support and thedensity of the esd to high precision; we prove this for finite discretedistributions. in computational experiments it outperforms existing methods byseveral orders of magnitude in speed and accuracy. we apply spectrode tocompute expectations and contour integrals of the esd. these quantities areoften central in applications of random matrix theory (rmt).  we illustrate that spectrode is directly useful in statistical problems, suchas estimation and hypothesis testing for covariance matrices. our proposal maymake it more convenient to use asymptotic rmt in aspects of high-dimensionaldata analysis.
