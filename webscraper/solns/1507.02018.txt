we address the issue of recovering the structure of large sparse directedacyclic graphs from noisy observations of the system. we propose a novelprocedure based on a specific formulation of the l1-norm regularized maximumlikelihood, which decomposes the graph estimation into two optimizationsub-problems: topological structure and node order learning. we provide oracleinequalities for the graph estimator, as well as an algorithm to solve theinduced optimization problem, in the form of a convex program embedded in agenetic algorithm. we apply our method to various data sets (including datafrom the dream4 challenge) and show that it compares favorably tostate-of-the-art methods.
