we discuss the integrability of rank 2 sub-riemannian structures onlow-dimensional manifolds, and then prove that some structures of that type indimension 6, 7 and 8 have a lot of symmetry but no integrals polynomial inmomenta of low degrees, except for those coming from the killing fields and thehamiltonian, thus indicating non-integrability of the corresponding geodesicflows.
