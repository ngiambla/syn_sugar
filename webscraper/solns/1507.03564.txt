the jacobian varieties of smooth curves fit together to form a family, theuniversal jacobian, over the moduli space of smooth marked curves, and thetheta divisors of these curves form a divisor in the universal jacobian. inthis paper we describe how to extend these families over the moduli space ofstable marked curves (or rather an open subset thereof) using a stabilityparameter. we then prove a wall-crossing formula describing how the thetadivisor varies with the stability parameter. we use that result to analyze adivisor on the moduli space of smooth marked curves that has recently beenstudied by grushevsky-zakharov, hain and m\"uller. in particular, we computethe pullback of the theta divisor studied in alexeev's work on stable abelicvarieties and in caporaso's work on theta divisors of compactified jacobians.
