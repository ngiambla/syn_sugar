a highly nonlinear, fourth-order wave equation that models the continuumtheory of long wavelength pulses in weakly compressed, discrete, homogeneouschains with a general power-law contact interaction is studied. for this waveequation, all solitary wave solutions and all nonlinear periodic wavesolutions, along with all conservation laws, are derived. the solutions areexplicitly parameterized in terms of the asymptotic value of the wave amplitudein the case of solitary waves and the peak of the wave amplitude in the case ofnonlinear periodic waves. all cases in which the solution expressions can bestated in an explicit analytic form using elementary functions are worked out.in these cases, explicit expressions for the total energy and total momentumfor all solutions are obtained as well. the derivation of the solutions usesthe conservation laws combined with an energy analysis argument to reduce thewave equation directly to a separable first-order differential equation whichdetermines the wave amplitude in terms of the travelling wave variable. thismethod can be applied more generally to other highly nonlinear wave equations.
