  product information labels can help users understand complex information
leading them to make better decisions. one area where consumers are
particularly prone to make costly decision-making errors is long-term saving,
which requires understanding of complex concepts such as uncertainty and
trade-offs. while most people are poorly equipped to deal with such concepts,
interactive design can potentially help users make better decisions. we
developed an interactive information label to assist consumers with retirement
saving decision-making. to evaluate it, we exposed 382 users to one of three
user interface conditions in a retirement saving simulator where they made 35
yearly decisions under changing circumstances. we found significantly better
ability of users to reach their goals with the information label. furthermore,
users who interacted with the label made better decisions than those who were
presented with a static information label. lastly, we found the label
particularly effective in helping novice savers.
