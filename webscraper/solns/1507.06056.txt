  during 2008-2015, twenty-two introductory workshops on graph and geometric
algorithms were organized for teachers and students (undergraduate,
post-graduate and doctoral) of engineering colleges and universities at
different states and union territories of india. the lectures were meant to
provide exposure to the field of graph and geometric algorithms and to motivate
the participants towards research. fifty-eight professors from tifr, iits,
iisc, imsc, cmi, isi kolkata, and other institutes and universities delivered
invited lectures on different topics in the design and analysis of algorithms,
discrete applied mathematics, computer graphics, computer vision, and robotics.
the first four workshops were funded by tifr, brns and iit kharagpur, and the
remaining workshops were funded by the nbhm. in this paper, we present the
salient features of these workshops, and state our observations on the national
impact of these workshops.
