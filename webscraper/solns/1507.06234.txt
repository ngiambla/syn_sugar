in this paper we determine the precise extent to which the classicalsl_2-theory of complex semisimple finite-dimensional lie algebras due tojacobson--morozov and kostant can be extended to positive characteristic. thisbuilds on work of pommerening and improves significantly upon previous attemptsdue to springer--steinberg and carter/spaltenstein. our main advance arises byinvestigating quite fully the extent to which subalgebras of the lie algebrasof semisimple algebraic groups over algebraically closed fields k areg-completely reducible, a notion essentially due to serre. for example if g isexceptional and char k=p\geq 5, we classify the triples (\h,\g,p) such thatthere exists a non-g-completely reducible subalgebra of \g isomorphic to \h. wedo this also under the restriction that \h be a p-subalgebra of \g. we findthat the notion of subalgebras being g-completely reducible effectivelycharacterises when it is possible to find bijections between the conjugacyclasses of sl_2-subalgebras and nilpotent orbits and it is this which allows usto prove our main theorems.  for absolute completeness, we also show that there is essentially only oneoccasion in which a nilpotent element cannot be extended to an sl_2-triple whenp\geq 3: this happens for the exceptional orbit in g_2 when p=3.
