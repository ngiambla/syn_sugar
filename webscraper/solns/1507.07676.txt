we show how to use jantzen's sum formula for weyl modules to provesemisimplicity criteria for endomorphism algebras of $\textbf{u}_q$-tiltingmodules (for any field $\mathbb{k}$ and any parameter$q\in\mathbb{k}-\{0,-1\}$). as an application, we recover the semisimplicitycriteria for the hecke algebras of types $\textbf{a}$ and $\textbf{b}$, thewalled brauer algebras and the brauer algebras from our more general approach.
