we consider transformations preserving a contracting foliation, such that theassociated quotient map satisfies a lasota yorke inequality. we prove that theassociated transfer operator, acting on suitable normed spaces, has spectralgap. as an application we consider lorenz-like two dimensional maps (piecewisehyperbolic with unbounded contraction and expansion rate): we prove that thosesystems have spectral gap and we show a quantitative estimation for theirstatistical stability. under deterministic perturbations of the system, thephysical measure varies continuously, with a modulus of continuity $o(\delta\log \delta ).$
