in this work we present a new criterion to check if a given rank-metric codeis a maximum rank distance (mrd) code. moreover, we derive a criterion to checkif a given mrd code is a generalized gabidulin code. we then use these resultsto come up with constructions of linear mrd codes of dimension 2 that are notgeneralized gabidulin codes.
