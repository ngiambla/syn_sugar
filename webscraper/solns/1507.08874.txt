  while substantial effort has been devoted to understand fraudulent activity
in traditional online advertising (search and banner), more recent forms such
as video ads have received little attention. the understanding and
identification of fraudulent activity (i.e., fake views) in video ads for
advertisers, is complicated as they rely exclusively on the detection
mechanisms deployed by video hosting portals. in this context, the development
of independent tools able to monitor and audit the fidelity of these systems
are missing today and needed by both industry and regulators.
  in this paper we present a first set of tools to serve this purpose. using
our tools, we evaluate the performance of the audit systems of five major
online video portals. our results reveal that youtube's detection system
significantly outperforms all the others. despite this, a systematic evaluation
indicates that it may still be susceptible to simple attacks. furthermore, we
find that youtube penalizes its videos' public and monetized view counters
differently, the former being more aggressive. this means that views identified
as fake and discounted from the public view counter are still monetized. we
speculate that even though youtube's policy puts in lots of effort to
compensate users after an attack is discovered, this practice places the burden
of the risk on the advertisers, who pay to get their ads displayed.
