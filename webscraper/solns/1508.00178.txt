let m be the shimura variety associated with the group of spinor similitudesof a rational quadratic space over of signature (n,2). we prove a conjecture ofbruinier-kudla-yang, relating the arithmetic intersection multiplicities ofspecial divisors and big cm points on m to the central derivatives of certain$l$-functions. as an application of this result, we prove an averaged versionof colmez's conjecture on the faltings heights of cm abelian varieties.
