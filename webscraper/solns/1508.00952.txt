computing the newton step for a generic function $f: \mathbb{r}^n \rightarrow\mathbb{r}$ takes $o(n^{3})$ flops. in this paper, we explore avenues forreducing this bound, when the computational structure of $f$ is knownbeforehand. it is shown that the newton step can be computed in time, linear inthe size of the computational-graph, and cubic in its tree-width.
