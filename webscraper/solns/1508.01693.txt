we refine the solvability of quadratic semimartingale bsdes by employing alipschitz-quadratic regularization procedure. in the first step, we prove anexistence and uniqueness result for a class of lipschitz-quadratic bsdes. acorresponding stability theorem and a lipschitz-quadratic regularization aredeveloped to solve quadratic bsdes. the advantage of our approach is that muchweaker conditions ensure the existence and uniqueness results.
