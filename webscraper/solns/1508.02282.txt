we develop sufficient analytic conditions for recurrence and transience ofnon-sectorial perturbations of possibly non-symmetric dirichlet forms on ageneral state space. these form an important subclass of generalized dirichletforms which were introduced in \cite{st1}. in case there exists an associatedprocess, we show how the analytic conditions imply recurrence and transience inthe classical probabilistic sense. as an application, we consider a generalizeddirichlet form given on a closed or open subset of $\mathbb{r}^d$ which isgiven as a divergence free first order perturbation of a non-symmetric energyform. then using volume growth conditions of the sectorial and non-sectorialfirst order part, we derive an explicit criterion for recurrence. moreover, wepresent concrete examples with applications to muckenhoupt weights andcounterexamples. the counterexamples show that the non-sectorial case differsqualitatively from the symmetric or non-symmetric sectorial case. namely, wemake the observation that one of the main criteria for recurrence in thesecases fails to be true for generalized dirichlet forms.
