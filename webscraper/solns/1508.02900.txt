the main challenge in the analysis of numerical schemes for the zakharovsystem originates from the presence of derivatives in the nonlinearity. in thispaper a new trigonometric time-integration scheme for the zakharov system isconstructed and convergence is proved. the time-step restriction is independentfrom a spatial discretization. numerical experiments confirm the findings.
