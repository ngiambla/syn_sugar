the main goal of the paper is to provide a quantitative lower bound greaterthan $1$ for the relative projection constant $\lambda(y, x)$, where $x$ is asubspace of $\ell_{2p}^m$ space and $y \subset x$ is an arbitrary hyperplane.as a consequence, we establish that for every integer $n \geq 4$ there existsan $n$-dimensional normed space $x$ such that for an every hyperplane $y$ andevery projection $p:x \to y$ the inequality $||p|| > 1 + \left (8 \left ( n + 3\right )^{5} \right )^{-30(n+3)^2}$ holds. this gives a non-trivial lower boundin a variation of problem proposed by bosznay and garay in $1986$.
