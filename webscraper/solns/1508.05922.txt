we present a new set of axioms for 2d tqft formulated on the category of cellgraphs with edge-contraction operations as morphisms. we construct a functorfrom this category to the endofunctor category consisting of frobeniusalgebras. edge-contraction operations correspond to natural transformations ofendofunctors, which are compatible with the frobenius algebra structure. givena frobenius algebra a, every cell graph determines an element of the symmetrictensor algebra defined over the dual space a*. we show that theedge-contraction axioms make this assignment depending only on the topologicaltype of the cell graph, but not on the graph itself. thus the functor generatesthe tqft corresponding to a.
