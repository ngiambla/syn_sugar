we review the basic outline of the highly successful diffusion monte carlotechnique commonly used in contexts ranging from electronic structurecalculations to rare event simulation and data assimilation, and propose a newclass of randomized iterative algorithms based on similar principles to addressa variety of common tasks in numerical linear algebra. from the point of viewof numerical linear algebra, the main novelty of the fast randomized iterationschemes described in this article is that they work in either linear orconstant cost per iteration (and in total, under appropriate conditions) andare rather versatile: we will show how they apply to solution of linearsystems, eigenvalue problems, and matrix exponentiation, in dimensions farbeyond the present limits of numerical linear algebra. while traditionaliterative methods in numerical linear algebra were created in part to deal withinstances where a matrix (of size $\mathcal{o}(n^2)$) is too big to store, thealgorithms that we propose are effective even in instances where the solutionvector itself (of size $\mathcal{o}(n)$) may be too big to store or manipulate.in fact, our work is motivated by recent dmc based quantum monte carlo schemesthat have been applied to matrices as large as $10^{108} \times 10^{108}$. weprovide basic convergence results, discuss the dependence of these results onthe dimension of the system, and demonstrate dramatic cost savings on a rangeof test problems.
