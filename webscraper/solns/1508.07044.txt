we study from the perspective of borel complexity theory the classificationproblem for multiplier algebras associated with operator algebraic varieties.these algebras are precisely the multiplier algebras of irreducible completenevanlinna-pick spaces. we prove that these algebras are not classifiable up toalgebraic isomorphism using countable structures as invariants. in order toprove such a result, we develop the theory of turbulence for polish groupoids,which generalizes hjorth's turbulence theory for polish group actions. we alsoprove that the classification problem for multiplier algebras associated withvarieties in a finite dimensional ball up to isometric isomorphism has maximumcomplexity among the essentially countable classification problems. inparticular, this shows that blaschke sequences are not smoothly classifiable upto conformal equivalence via automorphisms of the disc.
