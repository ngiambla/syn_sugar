the goals of this paper are twofold. first, we generalize the result ofgaboriau and lyons [gl07] to the setting of von neumann's problem forequivalence relations, proving that for any non-amenable ergodic probabilitymeasure preserving (pmp) equivalence relation $\mathcal{r}$, the bernoulliextension over a non-atomic base space $(k, \kappa)$ contains the orbitequivalence relation of a free ergodic pmp action of $\mathbb{f}_2$. moreover,we provide conditions which imply that this holds for any non-trivialprobability space $k$. second, we use this result to prove that anynon-amenable unimodular locally compact second countable group admitsuncountably many free ergodic pmp actions which are pairwise not von neumannequivalent (hence, pairwise not orbit equivalent).
