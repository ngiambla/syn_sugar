this article sets the foundations of a theory of perverse sheaves on arcspaces as it was conjectured by feigin-frenkel in 1990. we show a structuretheorem which says that arc spaces are locally products of something finitedimensional times an infinite dimensional affine space for the pro-smoothtopology. in particular, it answers a conjecture of kollar and nemethi. we thenintroduce a new topos, which allows us to define a bounded constructiblecategory of l-adic sheaves equipped with a t-structure and with a verdier dual.finally we define an intersection complex whose fibers are given by the finitedimensional models obtained using drinfeld-grinbeg-kazhdan's theorem.
