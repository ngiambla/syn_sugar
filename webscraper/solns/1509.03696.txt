a linear system is a pair $(x,\mathcal{f})$ where $\mathcal{f}$ is a finitefamily of subsets on a ground set $x$, and it satisfies that $|a\cap b|\leq 1$for every pair of distinct subsets $a,b \in \mathcal{f}$. as an example of alinear system are the straight line systems, which family of subsets arestraight line segments on $\mathbb{r}^{2}$. by $\tau$ and $\nu_2$ we denote thesize of the minimal transversal and the 2--packing numbers of a linear systemrespectively. a natural problem is asking about the relationship of these twoparameters; it is not difficult to prove that there exists a quadratic function$f$ holding $\tau\leq f(\nu_2)$. however, for straight line system we believethat $\tau\leq\nu_2-1$. in this paper we prove that for any linear system with$2$-packing numbers $\nu_2$ equal to $2, 3$ and $4$, we have that$\tau\leq\nu_2$. furthermore, we prove that the linear systems that attains theequality have transversal and $2$-packing numbers equal to $4$, and they are aspecial family of linear subsystems of the projective plane of order $3$. usingthis result we confirm that all straight line systems with $\nu_2\in\{2,3,4\}$satisfies $\tau\leq\nu_2-1$.
