we decide the borel complexity of the conjugacy problem for automorphismgroups of countable homogeneous digraphs. many of the homogeneous digraphs, aswell as several other homogeneous structures, have already been addressed inprevious articles. in this article we complete the program, and establish adichotomy theorem that this complexity is either the minimum or the maximumamong relations which are classifiable by countable structures. we also discussthe possibility of extending our results beyond graphs to more general classesof countable homogeneous structures.
