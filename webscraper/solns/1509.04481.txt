a class of (1+2)-dimensional diffusion-convection equations (nonlinearkolmogorov equations) with time-dependent coefficients is studied with liesymmetry point of view. the complete group classification is achieved using agauging of arbitrary elements (i.e. via reducing the number of variablecoefficients) with the application of equivalence transformations. two possiblegaugings are discussed in detail in order to show how equivalence groups servein making the optimal choice.
