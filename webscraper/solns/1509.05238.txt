  health and fitness wearable technology has recently advanced, making it
easier for an individual to monitor their behaviours. previously self generated
data interacts with the user to motivate positive behaviour change, but issues
arise when relating this to long term mention of wearable devices. previous
studies within this area are discussed. we also consider a new approach where
data is used to support instead of motivate, through monitoring and logging to
encourage reflection. based on issues highlighted, we then make recommendations
on the direction in which future work could be most beneficial.
