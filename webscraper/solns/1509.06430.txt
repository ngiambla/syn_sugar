the lov\'{a}sz local lemma (lll) is a cornerstone principle in theprobabilistic method of combinatorics, and a seminal algorithm of moser &tardos (2010) provides an efficient randomized algorithm to implement it. thiscan be parallelized to give an algorithm that uses polynomially many processorsand runs in $o(\log^3 n)$ time on an erew pram, stemming from $o(\log n)$adaptive computations of a maximal independent set (mis). chung et al. (2014)developed faster local and parallel algorithms, potentially running in time$o(\log^2 n)$, but these algorithms require more stringent conditions than thelll.  we give a new parallel algorithm that works under essentially the sameconditions as the original algorithm of moser & tardos but uses only a singlemis computation, thus running in $o(\log^2 n)$ time on an erew pram. this canbe derandomized to give an nc algorithm running in time $o(\log^2 n)$ as well,speeding up a previous nc lll algorithm of chandrasekaran et al. (2013).  we also provide improved and tighter bounds on the run-times of thesequential and parallel resampling-based algorithms originally developed bymoser & tardos. these apply to any problem instance in which the tightershearer lll criterion is satisfied.
