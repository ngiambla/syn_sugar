  branch is a web application that provides users with no programming with the
ability to interact directly with large biomedical datasets. the interaction is
mediated through a collaborative graphical user interface for building and
evaluating decision trees. these trees can be used to compose and test
sophisticated hypotheses and to develop predictive models. decision trees are
evaluated based on a library of imported datasets and can be stored in a
collective area for sharing and re-use. branch is hosted at
http://biobranch.org/ and the open source code is available at
http://bitbucket.org/sulab/biobranch/.
