  the number of computers, tablets and smartphones is increasing rapidly, which
entails the ownership and use of multiple devices to perform online tasks. as
people move across devices to complete these tasks, their identities becomes
fragmented. understanding the usage and transition between those devices is
essential to develop efficient applications in a multi-device world. in this
paper we present a solution to deal with the cross-device identification of
users based on semi-supervised machine learning methods to identify which
cookies belong to an individual using a device. the method proposed in this
paper scored third in the icdm 2015 drawbridge cross-device connections
challenge proving its good performance.
