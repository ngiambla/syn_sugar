we present a new approach to construct $t$-equivariant flat toricdegenerations of flag varieties and spherical varieties, combining ideas comingfrom the theory of newton-okounkov bodies with ideas originally stemming frompbw-filtrations. for each pair $(s,>)$ consisting of a birational sequence anda monomial order, we attach to the affine variety $g/\hskip -3.5pt/u$ a monoid$\gamma=\gamma(s,>)$. as a side effect we get a vector space basis $\mathbbb_{\gamma}$ of $\mathbb c[g/\hskip -3.5pt/u]$, the elements being indexed by$\gamma$. the basis $\mathbb b_{\gamma}$ has multiplicative properties verysimilar to those of the dual canonical basis. this makes it possible totransfer the methods of alexeev and brion \cite{ab} to this more generalsetting, once one knows that the monoid $\gamma$ is finitely generated andsaturated.
