take $(r, \mathfrak{m})$ any normal noetherian domain, either local or$\mathbb{n}$-graded over a field. we study the question of when $r$ satisfiesthe uniform symbolic topology property (ustp) of huneke, katz, and validashti:namely, that there exists an integer $d>0$ such that for all prime ideals $p\subseteq r$, the symbolic power $p^{(da)} \subseteq p^a$ for all $a >0$.reinterpreting results of lipman, we deduce that when $r$ is a two-dimensionalrational singularity, then it satisfies the ustp. emphasizing the non-regularsetting, we produce explicit, effective multipliers $d$, working in two classesof surface singularities in equal characteristic over an algebraically closedfield, using: (1) the volume of a parallelogram in $\mathbb{r}^2$ when $r$ isthe coordinate ring of a simplicial toric surface; or (2) known invariants ofdu val isolated singularities in characteristic zero due to lipman.
