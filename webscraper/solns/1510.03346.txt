  autonomous vehicles (avs) should reduce traffic accidents, but they will
sometimes have to choose between two evils-for example, running over
pedestrians or sacrificing itself and its passenger to save them. defining the
algorithms that will help avs make these moral decisions is a formidable
challenge. we found that participants to six mturk studies approved of
utilitarian avs (that sacrifice their passengers for the greater good), and
would like others to buy them, but they would themselves prefer to ride in avs
that protect their passengers at all costs. they would disapprove of enforcing
utilitarian avs, and would be less willing to buy such a regulated av.
accordingly, regulating for utilitarian algorithms may paradoxically increase
casualties by postponing the adoption of a safer technology.
