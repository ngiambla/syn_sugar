a finite dimensional quantum system for which the quantum chaos conjectureapplies has eigenstates, which show the same statistical properties than thecolumn vectors of random orthogonal or unitary matrices. here, we consider thedifferent probabilities for obtaining a specific outcome in a projectivemeasurement, provided the system is in one of its eigenstates. we then giveanalytic expressions for the joint probability density for these probabilities,with respect to the ensemble of random matrices. in the case of the unitarygroup, our results can be applied, also, to the phenomenon of universalconductance fluctuations, where the same mathematical quantities describepartial conductances in a two-terminal mesoscopic scattering problem with afinite number of modes in each terminal.
