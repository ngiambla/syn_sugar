we investigate the geometric properties of steklov eigenfunctions in smoothmanifolds. we derive the refined doubling estimates and bernstein'sinequalities. for the real analytic manifolds, we are able to obtain the sharpupper bound for the measure of interior nodal sets$h^{n-1}(\mathcal{n}_\lambda)\leq c\lambda$. here the positive constant $c$depends only on the manifolds.
