flat structure was introduced by k. saito and his collaborators at the end of1970's. independently the wdvv equation arose from the 2d topological fieldtheory. b. dubrovin unified these two notions as the frobenius manifoldstructure. in this paper we treat saito structure (without metric) by c. sabbahwhich is one of generalizations of frobenius manifold structure. we connectsaito structure (without metric) with isomonodromic deformations of okubosystems which are a special kind of systems of linear differential equations.as the advantage of introduction of okubo systems, the following results areobtained: (i) introduction of flat coordinates on the orbit spaces ofwell-generated finite complex reflection groups (ii) establishment of acorrespondence between solutions satisfying certain semisimplicity condition tothe three dimensional extended wdvv equation and generic solutions to the sixthpainlev\'e equation (iii) explicit description of potential vector fieldscorresponding to algebraic solutions to the sixth painlev\'e equation.
