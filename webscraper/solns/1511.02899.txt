we study the following combinatorial version of the slepian-wolf codingscheme. two isolated senders are given binary strings $x$ and $y$ respectively;the length of each string is equal to $n$, and the hamming distance between thestrings is at most $\alpha n$. the senders compress their strings andcommunicate the results to the receiver. then the receiver must reconstructboth strings $x$ and $y$. the aim is to minimise the lengths of the transmittedmessages.  for an asymmetric variant of this problem (where one of the senders transmitsthe input string to the receiver without compression) with deterministicencoding a nontrivial lower bound was found by a.orlitsky and k.viswanathany.in our paper we prove a new lower bound for the schemes with syndrome coding,where at least one of the senders uses linear encoding of the input string.  for the combinatorial slepian-wolf problem with randomized encoding thetheoretical optimum of communication complexity was recently found by the firstauthor, though effective protocols with optimal lengths of messages remainedunknown. we close this gap and present a polynomial time randomized protocolthat achieves the optimal communication complexity.
