we present a new approach for computing approximate global minimizers to alarge class of non-local pairwise interaction problems defined over probabilitydistributions. the approach predicts candidate global minimizers, with arecovery guarantee, that are sometimes exact, and often within a few percent ofthe optimum energy (under appropriate normalization of the energy). theprocedure relies on a convex relaxation of the pairwise energy that exploitstranslational symmetry, followed by a recovery procedure that minimizes arelative entropy. numerical discretizations of the convex relaxation yield alinear programming problem over convex cones that can be solved usingwell-known methods. one advantage of the approach is that it providessufficient conditions for global minimizers to a non-convex quadraticvariational problem, in the form of a linear, convex, optimization problem forthe auto-correlation of the probability density. we demonstrate the approach ina periodic domain for examples arising from models in materials, socialphenomena and flocking. the approach also exactly recovers the global minimizerwhen a lattice of dirac masses solves the convex relaxation. an importantby-product of the relaxation is a decomposition of the pairwise energyfunctional into the sum of a convex functional and non-convex functional. weobserve that in some cases, the non-convex component of the decomposition canbe used to characterize the support of the recovered minimizers.
