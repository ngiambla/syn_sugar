the sensor network localization (snl) problem is to reconstruct the positionsof all the sensors in a network with the given distance between pairs ofsensors and within the radio range between them. it is proved that thecomputational complexity of the snl problem is np-hard, and semi-definiteprogramming or second-order cone programming relaxation methods are only ableto solve some special problems of this kind. in this study, a stochastic globaloptimization method called the state transition algorithm is introduced tosolve the snl problem without additional assumptions and conditions of theproblem structure. to transcend local optimality, a novel dynamic adjustmentstrategy called "risk and restoration in probability" is incorporated into thestate transition algorithm. an empirical study is investigated to appropriatelychoose the "risk probability" and "restoration probability", yielding thedynamic state transition algorithm, which is further improved by gradient-basedrefinement. the dynamic state transition algorithm with refinement is appliedto the snl problem, and satisfactory experimental results have testified theeffectiveness of the proposed approach.
