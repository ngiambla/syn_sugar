  the aim of this paper is to study m-learning literature in order to propose
and develop a privacy-preserving framework which can be used to foster
sustainable deployment of mobile learning within open and distance education in
kenya. location-based privacy in mobile learning is essential to retain users
trust, key to influencing usage intention. any risk on privacy can negatively
affect users perceptions of a systems reliability and trustworthiness. while
extant studies have proposed frameworks for mobile technologies adoption into
learning, few have integrated privacy aspects and their influence on m-learning
implementation. the framework would provide university management with informed
approach to consider privacy preserving aspects in m-learning implementation.
also, it could provide enlightened guidance to mobile learning application
developers on the need to cater for learners privacy aspects.
