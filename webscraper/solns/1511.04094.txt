  this study investigates the role of both cultural and technological factors
in determining audience formation on a global scale. it integrates theories of
media choice with theories of global cultural consumption and tests them by
analyzing shared audience traffic between the world's 1000 most popular
websites. we find that language and geographic similarities are more powerful
predictors of audience overlap than hyperlinks and genre similarity,
highlighting the role of cultural structures in shaping global media use.
