  in the current hyper-connected era, modern information and communication
technology systems form sophisticated networks where not only do people
interact with other people, but also machines take an increasingly visible and
participatory role. such human-machine networks (hmns) are embedded in the
daily lives of people, both for personal and professional use. they can have a
significant impact by producing synergy and innovations. the challenge in
designing successful hmns is that they cannot be developed and implemented in
the same manner as networks of machines nodes alone, nor following a wholly
human-centric view of the network. the problem requires an interdisciplinary
approach. here, we review current research of relevance to hmns across many
disciplines. extending the previous theoretical concepts of socio-technical
systems, actor-network theory, cyber-physical-social systems, and social
machines, we concentrate on the interactions among humans and between humans
and machines. we identify eight types of hmns: public-resource computing,
crowdsourcing, web search engines, crowdsensing, online markets, social media,
multiplayer online games and virtual worlds, and mass collaboration. we
systematically select literature on each of these types and review it with a
focus on implications for designing hmns. moreover, we discuss risks associated
with hmns and identify emerging design and development trends.
