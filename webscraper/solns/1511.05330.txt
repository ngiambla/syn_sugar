we show how the combination of new "linearization" ideas in free probabilitytheory with the powerful "realization" machinery -- developed over the last 50years in fields including systems engineering and automata theory -- allowssolving the problem of determining the eigenvalue distribution (or even thebrown measure, in the non-selfadjoint case) of noncommutative rationalfunctions of random matrices when their size tends to infinity. along the waywe extend evaluations of noncommutative rational expressions from matrices tostably finite algebras, e.g. type ii$_1$ von neumann algebras, with a precisecontrol of the domains of the rational expressions.  the paper provides sufficient background information, with the intention thatit should be accessible both to functional analysts and to algebraists.
