  significant portion of contemporary computer users are children, who are
vulnerable to threats coming from the internet. to protect children from such
threats, in this study, we investigate how successfully typing data can be used
to distinguish children from adults. for this purpose, we collect a dataset
comprising keystroke data of 100 users and show that distinguishing child
internet users from adults is possible using keystroke dynamics with equal
error rates less than 10 percent. however the error rates increase
significantly when there are impostors in the system.
