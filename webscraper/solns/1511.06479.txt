to understand the spreading and interaction of prey and predator, in thispaper we study the dynamics of the diffusive lotka-volterra type prey-predatormodel with different free boundaries. these two free boundaries, which mayintersect each other as time evolves, are used to describe the spreading ofprey and predator. we investigate the existence and uniqueness, regularity anduniform estimates, and long time behaviors of global solution. some sufficientconditions for spreading and vanishing are established. when spreading occurs,we provide the more accurate limits of (u,v) as t\to\infty, and give someestimates of asymptotic spreading speeds of u,v and asymptotic speeds of g,h.some realistic and significant spreading phenomena are found.
