magnetic resonance imaging (mri) is a versatile imaging technique that allowsdifferent contrasts depending on the acquisition parameters. many clinicalimaging studies acquire mri data for more than one of these contrasts---such asfor instance t1 and t2 weighted images---which makes the overall scanningprocedure very time consuming. as all of these images show the same underlyinganatomy one can try to omit unnecessary measurements by taking the similarityinto account during reconstruction. we will discuss two modifications of totalvariation---based on i) location and ii) direction---that take structural apriori knowledge into account and reduce to total variation in the degeneratecase when no structural knowledge is available. we solve the resulting convexminimization problem with the alternating direction method of multipliers thatseparates the forward operator from the prior. for both priors thecorresponding proximal operator can be implemented as an extension of the fastgradient projection method on the dual problem for total variation. we testedthe priors on six data sets that are based on phantoms and real mri images. inall test cases exploiting the structural information from the other contrastyields better results than separate reconstruction with total variation interms of standard metrics like peak signal-to-noise ratio and structuralsimilarity index. furthermore, we found that exploiting the two dimensionaldirectional information results in images with well defined edges, superior tothose reconstructed solely using a priori information about the edge location.
