reduced magnetohydrodynamics is a simplified set of magnetohydrodynamicsequations with applications to both fusion and astrophysical plasmas,possessing a noncanonical hamiltonian structure and consequently a number ofconserved functionals. we propose a new discretisation strategy for theseequations based on a discrete variational principle applied to a formallagrangian. the resulting integrator preserves important quantities like thetotal energy, magnetic helicity and cross helicity exactly (up to machineprecision). as the integrator is free of numerical resistivity, spuriousreconnection along current sheets is absent in the ideal case. if effects ofelectron inertia are added, reconnection of magnetic field lines is allowed,although the resulting model still possesses a noncanonical hamiltonianstructure. after reviewing the conservation laws of the model equations, theadopted variational principle with the related conservation laws are describedboth at the continuous and discrete level. we verify the favourable propertiesof the variational integrator in particular with respect to the preservation ofthe invariants of the models under consideration and compare with results fromthe literature and those of a pseudo-spectral code.
