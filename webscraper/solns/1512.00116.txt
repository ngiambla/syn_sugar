for the bgg category of $\mathfrak{q}(n)$-modules of half-integer weights, akazhdan-lusztig conjecture \`a la brundan is formulated in terms of categoricalcanonical basis of the $n$th tensor power of the natural representation of thequantum group of type $c$. for the bgg category of $\mathfrak{q}(n)$-modules ofcongruent non-integral weights, a kazhdan-lusztig conjecture is formulated interms of canonical basis of a mixed tensor of the natural representation andits dual of the quantum group of type $a$. we also establish a characterformula for the finite-dimensional irreducible $\mathfrak{q}(n)$-modules ofhalf-integer weights in terms of type $c$ canonical basis of the corresponding$q$-wedge space.
