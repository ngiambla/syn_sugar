in this paper, a delay vlasov-fokker-planck equation associated to astochastic interacting particle system with delay is investigated analytically.under certain restrictions on the parameters well-posedness and ergodicity ofthe mean-field equation are shown and an exponential rate of convergencetowards the unique stationary solution is proven as long as the delay isfinite. for infinte delay i.e., when all the history of the solution paths aretaken into consideration polynomial decay of the solution is shown.
