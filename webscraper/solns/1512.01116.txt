we study the quasi-neutral limit in an optimal semiconductor design problemconstrained by a nonlinear, nonlocal poisson equation modelling the driftdiffusion equations in thermal equilibrium. while a broad knowledge on theasymptotic links between the different models in the semiconductor modelhierarchy exists, there are so far no results on the corresponding optimizationproblems available. using a variational approach we end up with a bi-leveloptimization problem, which is thoroughly analysed. further, we exploit theconcept of gamma-convergence to perform the quasi-neutral limit for the minimaand minimizers. this justifies the construction of fast optimization algorithmsbased on the zero space charge approximation of the drift-diffusion model. theanalytical results are underlined by numerical experiments confirming thefeasibility of our approach.
