based on crapo's theory of one point extensions of combinatorial geometries,we find various classes of geometric lattices that behave very well from thepoint of view of stability theory. one of them, $(\mathbf{k}^3, \preccurlyeq)$,is $\omega$-stable, it has a monster model and an independence calculus thatsatisfies all the usual properties of non-forking. on the other hand, theseclasses are rather unusual, e.g. in $(\mathbf{k}^3, \preccurlyeq)$ thesmoothness axiom fails, and so $(\mathbf{k}^3, \preccurlyeq)$ is not an$\mathrm{aec}$.
