via gelfand duality, a unital c*-algebra $a$ induces a functor from compacthausdorff spaces to sets, $\mathsf{chaus}\to\mathsf{set}$. we show how thisfunctor encodes standard functional calculus in $a$ as well as its multivariategeneralization. certain sheaf conditions satisfied by this functor provide afurther generalization of functional calculus. considering such sheaves$\mathsf{chaus}\to\mathsf{set}$ abstractly, we prove that the piecewisec*-algebras of van den berg and heunen are equivalent to a full subcategory ofthe category of sheaves, where a simple additional constraint characterizes theobjects in the subcategory. it is open whether this additional constraint holdsautomatically, in which case piecewise c*-algebras would be the same as sheaves$\mathsf{chaus}\to\mathsf{set}$.  intuitively, these structures capture the commutative aspects of c*-algebratheory. in order to find a complete reaxiomatization of unital c*-algebraswithin this language, we introduce almost c*-algebras as piecewise c*-algebrasequipped with a notion of inner automorphisms in terms of a self-action. weprovide some evidence for the conjecture that the forgetful functor from unitalc*-algebras to almost c*-algebras is fully faithful, and ask whether it is anequivalence of categories. we also develop an analogous notion of almost group,and prove that the forgetful functor from groups to almost groups is not full.  in terms of quantum physics, our work can be seen as an attempt at areconstruction of quantum theory from physically meaningful axioms, as realizedby hardy and others in a different framework. our ideas are inspired by andalso provide new input for the topos-theoretic approach to quantum theory.
