we prove that if an involution in a ring is the sum of an idempotent and anilpotent then the idempotent in this decomposition must be 1. as aconsequence, we completely characterize weakly nil-clean rings introducedrecently in [breaz, danchev and zhou, rings in which every element is either asum or a difference of a nilpotent and an idempotent, j. algebra appl., doi:10.1142/s0219498816501486].
