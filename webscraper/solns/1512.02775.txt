a vertex-transitive graph x is called local-to-global rigid if there exists rsuch that every other graph whose balls of radius r are isometric to the ballsof radius r in x is covered by x. let $d\geq 4$. we show that the 1-skeleton ofan affine bruhat-tits building of type $\widetilde a_{d-1}$ is local-to-globalrigid if and only if the underlying field has characteristic 0. for example thebruhat-tits building of $sl(d,f_p((t)))$ is not local-to-global rigid, whilethe bruhat-tits building of $sl(d,q_p)$ is local-to-global rigid.
