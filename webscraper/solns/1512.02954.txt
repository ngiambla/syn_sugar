we explore the connections between dickson's lemma and weak ramsey theory. weshow that a weak version of the paris--harrington principle for pairs in $c$colors and miniaturized dickson's lemma for $c$-tuples are equivalent over$\mathsf{rca}_0^{\ast}$. furthermore, we look at a cascade of consequences forseveral variants of weak ramsey's theorem.
