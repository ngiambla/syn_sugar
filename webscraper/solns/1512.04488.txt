in this paper, we discuss the numerical approximation of random periodicsolutions (r.p.s.) of stochastic differential equations (sdes) withmultiplicative noise. we prove the existence of the random periodic solution asthe limit of the pull-back flow when the starting time tends to $-\infty$ alongthe multiple integrals of the period. as the random periodic solution is notexplicitly constructible, it is useful to study the numerical approximation. wediscretise the sde using the euler-maruyama scheme and moldiflied milsteinscheme. subsequently we obtain the existence of the random periodic solution asthe limit of the pull-back of the discretised sde. we prove that the latter isan approximated random periodic solution with an error to the exact one at therate of $\sqrt {\delta t}$ in the mean-square sense in euler-maruyama methodand $\delta t$ in the milstein method. we also obtain the weak convergenceresult for the approximation of the periodic measure.
