in this paper we prove that for any simplicial set $b$, there is a quillenequivalence between the covariant model structure on $\mathbf{s}/b$ and acertain localization of the projective model structure on the category ofsimplicial presheaves on the simplex category $\delta/b$ of $b$. we extend thisresult to give a new quillen equivalence between this covariant model structureand the projective model structure on the category of simplicial presheaves onthe simplicial category $\mathfrak{c}[b]$. we study the relationship withlurie's straightening theorem. along the way we prove some results onlocalizations of simplicial categories and quasi-categories.
