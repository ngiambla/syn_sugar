we prove that for every integer $t\geq 1$, the class of intersection graphsof curves in the plane each of which crosses a fixed curve in at least one andat most $t$ points is $\chi$-bounded. this is essentially the strongest$\chi$-boundedness result one can get for this kind of graph classes. as acorollary, we prove that for any fixed integers $k\geq 2$ and $t\geq 1$, every$k$-quasi-planar topological graph on $n$ vertices with any two edges crossingat most $t$ times has $o(n\log n)$ edges.
