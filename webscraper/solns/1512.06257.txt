  the emerging internet of things (iot) will comprise billions of web-enabled
objects (or "things") where such objects can sense, communicate, compute and
potentially actuate. wot is essentially the embodiment of the evolution from
systems linking digital documents to systems relating digital information to
real-world physical items. it is widely understood that significant technical
challenges exist in developing applications in the wot environment. in this
paper, we report our practical experience in the design and development of a
smart home system in a wot environment. our system provides a layered framework
for managing and sharing the information produced by physical things as well as
the residents. we particularly focus on a research prototype named wits, that
helps the elderly live independently and safely in their own homes, with
minimal support from the decreasing number of individuals in the working-age
population. wits enables an unobtrusive monitoring of elderly people in a
real-world, inhabituated home environment, by leveraging wot technologies in
building context-aware, personalized services.
