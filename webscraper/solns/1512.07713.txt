markov chain monte carlo (mcmc) produces a correlated sample for estimatingexpectations with respect to a target distribution. a fundamental question iswhen should sampling stop so that we have good estimates of the desiredquantities? the key to answering this question lies in assessing the montecarlo error through a multivariate markov chain central limit theorem (clt).the multivariate nature of this monte carlo error largely has been ignored inthe mcmc literature. we present a multivariate framework for terminatingsimulation in mcmc. we define a multivariate effective sample size, estimatingwhich requires strongly consistent estimators of the covariance matrix in themarkov chain clt; a property we show for the multivariate batch meansestimator. we then provide a lower bound on the number of minimum effectivesamples required for a desired level of precision. this lower bound depends onthe problem only in the dimension of the expectation being estimated, and noton the underlying stochastic process. this result is obtained by drawing aconnection between terminating simulation via effective sample size andterminating simulation using a relative standard deviation fixed-volumesequential stopping rule; which we demonstrate is an asymptotically validprocedure. the finite sample properties of the proposed method are demonstratedin a variety of examples.
