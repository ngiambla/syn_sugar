  with recent advances in radio-frequency identification (rfid), wireless
sensor networks, and web services, physical things are becoming an integral
part of the emerging ubiquitous web. finding correlations of ubiquitous things
is a crucial prerequisite for many important applications such as things
search, discovery, classification, recommendation, and composition. this
article presents discor-t, a novel graph-based method for discovering
underlying connections of things via mining the rich content embodied in
human-thing interactions in terms of user, temporal and spatial information. we
model these various information using two graphs, namely spatio-temporal graph
and social graph. then, random walk with restart (rwr) is applied to find
proximities among things, and a relational graph of things (rgt) indicating
implicit correlations of things is learned. the correlation analysis lays a
solid foundation contributing to improved effectiveness in things management.
to demonstrate the utility, we develop a flexible feature-based classification
framework on top of rgt and perform a systematic case study. our evaluation
exhibits the strength and feasibility of the proposed approach.
