for an associative ring $r$, the projective level of a complex $f$ is thesmallest number of mapping cones needed to build $f$ from projective$r$-modules. we establish lower bounds for the projective level of $f$ in termsof the vanishing of homology of $f$. we then use these bounds to derive a newversion of the new intersection theorem for level when $r$ is a commutativenoetherian local ring.
