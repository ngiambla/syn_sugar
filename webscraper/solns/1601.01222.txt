  pervasive social computing is a promising approach that promises to empower
both the individual and the whole and thus candidates itself as a foundation to
the "smarter" social organizations that our new turbulent and resource-scarce
worlds so urgently requires. in this contribution we first identify those that
we consider as the major requirements to be fulfilled in order to realize an
effective pervasive social computing infrastructure. we then conjecture that
our service-oriented community and fractal social organization fulfill those
requirements and therefore constitute an effective strategy to design pervasive
social computing infrastructures. in order to motivate our conjecture, in this
paper we discuss a model of social translucence and discuss fractal social
organization as a referral service empowering a social system's parts and
whole.
