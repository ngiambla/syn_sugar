in this article we prove that lax pairs associated with $\hbar$-dependent sixpainlev\'e equations satisfy the topological type property proposed byberg\`ere, borot and eynard for any generic choice of the monodromy parameters.consequently we show that one can reconstruct the formal $\hbar$-expansion ofthe isomonodromic $\tau$-function and of the determinantal formulas by applyingthe so-called topological recursion to the spectral curve attached to the laxpair in all six painlev\'e cases. finally we illustrate the former results withthe explicit computations of the first orders of the six $\tau$-functions.
