the heun operator has been cast, in terms of the elements of an underlying$su(1,1)$ algebra, under specific parametric conditions, for the purpose ofspectrum generation. these elements are differential operators of\emph{degrees} $\pm 1/2$ and $0$. it is found that the regular singularities at$0$ and $\infty$ of the general heun equation must be \emph{elementary} underthe required parametric conditions. the spectrum generation has beendemonstrated through a set of examples.
