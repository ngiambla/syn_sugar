we deal with direct and inverse problems of the calculus of variations onarbitrary time scales. firstly, using the euler-lagrange equation and thestrengthened legendre condition, we give a general form for a variationalfunctional to attain a local minimum at a given point of the vector space.furthermore, we provide a necessary condition for a dynamicintegro-differential equation to be an euler-lagrange equation (helmholtz'sproblem of the calculus of variations on time scales). new and interestingresults for the discrete and quantum settings are obtained as particular cases.finally, we consider very general problems of the calculus of variations givenby the composition of a certain scalar function with delta and nabla integralsof a vector valued field.
