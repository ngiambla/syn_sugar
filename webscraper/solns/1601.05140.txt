  a number of organizations ranging from terrorist groups such as isis to
politicians and nation states reportedly conduct explicit campaigns to
influence opinion on social media, posing a risk to democratic processes. there
is thus a growing need to identify and eliminate "influence bots" - realistic,
automated identities that illicitly shape discussion on sites like twitter and
facebook - before they get too influential. spurred by such events, darpa held
a 4-week competition in february/march 2015 in which multiple teams supported
by the darpa social media in strategic communications program competed to
identify a set of previously identified "influence bots" serving as ground
truth on a specific topic within twitter. past work regarding influence bots
often has difficulty supporting claims about accuracy, since there is limited
ground truth (though some exceptions do exist [3,7]). however, with the
exception of [3], no past work has looked specifically at identifying influence
bots on a specific topic. this paper describes the darpa challenge and
describes the methods used by the three top-ranked teams.
