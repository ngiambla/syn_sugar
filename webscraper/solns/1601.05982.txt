we propose a comprehensive framework exploiting the polarization sensitivearray (pla) to improve the physical layer security of wireless communications.more specifically, the polarization difference among signals is utilized toimprove the secrecy rate of wireless communications, especially when thesesignals are spatially indistinguishable. we firstly investigate the pla basedsecure communications for point-to-point wireless systems from the perspectivesof both total power minimization and secrecy rate maximization. we then take astep further to apply the pla based secure beamforming designs to relayingnetworks. the secrecy rate maximization for relaying networks is discussed indetail under both the perfect channel state information and the polarizationsensitive array pointing error. in the later case, a robust scheme to achievesecure communications for relaying networks is proposed. simulation resultsshow that the proposed pla based algorithms achieve lower total powerconsumption and better security performance compared with the conventionalscalar array designs, especially under challenging environments where allreceived signals at destination are difficult to be distinguished from thespatial domain.
