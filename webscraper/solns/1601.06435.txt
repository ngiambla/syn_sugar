given an $\alpha > 1$ and a $\theta$ with unbounded continued fractionentries, we characterise new relations between sturmian subshifts with slope$\theta$ with respect to (i) an $\alpha$-h\"oder regularity condition of aspectral metric, (ii) level sets defined in terms of the diophantine propertiesof $\theta$, and (iii) complexity notions which we call $\alpha$-repetitive,$\alpha$-repulsive and $\alpha$-finite; generalisations of the properties knownas linearly repetitive, repulsive and power free, respectively. we show thatthe level sets relate naturally to (exact) jarn\'{\i}k sets and prove thattheir hausdorff dimension is $2/(\alpha + 1)$.
