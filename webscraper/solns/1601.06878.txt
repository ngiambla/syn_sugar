the authors in a previous paper devised certain subcones of the semidefiniteplus nonnegative cone and showed that satisfaction of the requirements formembership of those subcones can be detected by solving linear optimizationproblems (lps) with $o(n)$ variables and $o(n^2)$ constraints. they alsodevised lp-based algorithms for testing copositivity using the subcones. inthis paper, they investigate the properties of the subcones in more detail andexplore larger subcones of the positive semidefinite plus nonnegative conewhose satisfaction of the requirements for membership can be detected bysolving lps. they introduce a {\em semidefinite basis (sd basis)} that is abasis of the space of $n \times n$ symmetric matrices consisting of $n(n+1)/2$symmetric semidefinite matrices. using the sd basis, they devise two newsubcones for which detection can be done by solving lps with $o(n^2)$ variablesand $o(n^2)$ constraints. the new subcones are larger than the ones in theprevious paper and inherit their nice properties. the authors also examine theefficiency of those subcones in numerical experiments. the results show thatthe subcones are promising for testing copositivity as a useful application.
