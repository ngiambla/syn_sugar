building on work by kontsevich, soibelman, nagao and efimov, we prove thepositivity of quantum cluster coefficients for all skew-symmetric quantumcluster algebras, via a proof of a conjecture first suggested by kontsevich onthe purity of mixed hodge structures arising in the theory of cluster mutationof spherical collections in 3-calabi-yau categories. the result impliespositivity, as well as the stronger lefschetz property conjectured by efimov,and also the classical positivity conjecture of fomin and zelevinsky, recentlyproved by lee and schiffler. closely related to these results is a categorified"no exotics" type theorem for cohomological donaldson-thomas invariants, whichwe discuss and prove in the appendix.
