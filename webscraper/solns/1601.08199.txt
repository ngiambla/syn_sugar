in $1980$ white conjectured that the toric ideal associated to a matroid isgenerated by quadratic binomials corresponding to symmetric exchanges. we provewhite's conjecture for high degrees (w.r.t. rank of a matroid). that is, weprove that for all matroids of fixed rank $r$, homogeneous parts of degree atleast $c(r)$ of the corresponding toric ideals are generated by quadraticbinomials corresponding to symmetric exchanges. this extends our previousresult [laso\'n, micha{\l}ek, on the toric ideal of a matroid, adv. math. 259(2014), 1-12] confirming the conjecture `up to saturation'.
