this paper investigates a wireless-powered cooperative network (wpcn)consisting of one source-destination pair and multiple decode-and-forward (df)relays. we develop an energy threshold based multi-relay selection (etmrs)scheme for the considered wpcn. the proposed etmrs scheme can be implemented ina fully distributed manner as the relays only need local information to switchbetween energy harvesting and information forwarding modes. by modeling thecharging/discharging behaviours of the finite-capacity battery at each relay asa finite-state markov chain (mc), we derive an analytical expression for thesystem outage probability of the proposed etmrs scheme over mixed nakagami-$m$and rayleigh fading channels. based on the derived expression, the optimalenergy thresholds for all the relays corresponding to the minimum system outageprobability can be obtained via an exhaustive search. however, this approachbecomes computationally prohibitive when the number of relays and theassociated number of battery energy levels is large. to resolve this issue, wepropose a heuristic approach to optimize the energy threshold for each relay.to gain some useful insights for practical relay design, we also derive theupper bound for system outage probability corresponding to the case that allrelays are equipped with infinite-capacity batteries. numerical resultsvalidate our theoretical analysis. it is shown that the proposed heuristicapproach can achieve a near-optimal system performance and our etmrs schemeoutperforms the existing single-relay selection scheme and common energythreshold scheme.
