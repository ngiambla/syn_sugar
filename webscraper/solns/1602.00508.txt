we bring a bayesian approach to the analysis of clocks. using exponentialdistributions as priors for clocks, we analyze how well one can keep time witha single qubit freely precessing under a magnetic field. we find that, at leastwith a single qubit, quantum mechanics does not allow exact timekeeping, incontrast to classical mechanics which does. we find the design of thesingle-qubit clock that leads to maximum accuracy. further, we find an energyversus accuracy tradeoff --- the energy cost is at least $k_bt$ times theimprovement in accuracy as measured by the entropy reduction in going from theprior distribution to the posterior distribution. we propose a physicalrealization of the single qubit clock using charge transport across acapacitively-coupled quantum dot.
