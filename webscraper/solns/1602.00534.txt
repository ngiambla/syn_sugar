we classify complete gradient ricci solitons satisfying a fourth-ordervanishing condition on the weyl tensor, improving previously known results.more precisely, we show that any $n$-dimensional ($n\geq 4$) gradient shrinkingricci soliton with fourth order divergence-free weyl tensor is either einstein,or a finite quotient of $n^{n-k}\times \mathbb{r}^k$, $(k > 0)$, the product ofa einstein manifold $n^{n-k}$ with the gaussian shrinking soliton$\mathbb{r}^k$. the technique applies also to the steady and expanding cases inall dimensions. in particular, we prove that a three dimensional gradientsteady soliton with third order divergence-free cotton tensor, i.e. withvanishing double divergence of the bach tensor, is either flat or isometric tothe bryant soliton.
