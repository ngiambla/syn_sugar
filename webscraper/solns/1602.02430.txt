in answer to a question raised recently by bourgain and lewko, we show, withtheir paper's terminology, that any uniformly bounded $\psi_2 (c)$-orthonormalsystem ($\psi_2 (c)$ is a variant of subgaussian)is 2-fold tensor sidon. thissharpens their result that it is 5-fold tensor sidon. the proof is somewhatreminiscent of the author's original one for (abelian) group characters, basedon ideas due to drury and rider. however, we use talagrand's majorizing measuretheorem in place of fernique's metric entropy lower bound. we also show that auniformly bounded orthonormal system is randomly sidon iff it is 4-fold tensorsidon, or equivalently $k$-fold tensor sidon for some (or all) $k\ge 4$.various generalizations are presented, including the case of random matrices,for systems analogous to the peter-weyl decomposition for compact non-abeliangroups. in the latter setting we also include a new proof of rider'sunpublished result that randomly sidon sets are sidon, which implies that theunion of two sidon sets is sidon.
