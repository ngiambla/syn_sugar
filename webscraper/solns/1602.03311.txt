pairwise comparison matrices are frequently applied in multi-criteriadecision making. a weight vector is called efficient if no other weight vectoris at least as good in approximating the elements of the pairwise comparisonmatrix, and strictly better in at least one position. a weight vector is weaklyefficient if the pairwise ratios cannot be improved in all non-diagonalpositions. we show that the principal eigenvector is always weakly efficient,but numerical examples show that it can be inefficient. the linear programsproposed test whether a given weight vector is (weakly) efficient, and in caseof (strong) inefficiency, an efficient (strongly) dominating weight vector iscalculated. the proposed algorithms are implemented in pairwise comparisonmatrix calculator, available at pcmc.online.
