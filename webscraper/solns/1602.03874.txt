we prove two results about the derived functor of $a$-adic completion: (1)let $k$ be a commutative noetherian ring, let $a$ be a flat noetherian$k$-algebra which is $a$-adically complete with respect to some ideal$a\subseteq a$, such that $a/a$ is essentially of finite type over $k$, and let$m,n$ be finitely generated $a$-modules. then adic reduction to the diagonalholds: $a\otimes^{l}_{ a\hat{\otimes}_{k} a } ( m\hat{\otimes}^{l}_{k} n )\cong m \otimes^{l}_a n$. a similar result is given in the case where $m,n$ arenot necessarily finitely generated. (2) let $a$ be a commutative ring, let$a\subseteq a$ be a weakly proregular ideal, let $m$ be an $a$-module, andassume that the $a$-adic completion of $a$ is noetherian (if $a$ is noetherian,all these conditions are always satisfied). then $\mbox{ext}^i_a(a/a,m)$ isfinitely generated for all $i\ge 0$ if and only if the derived $a$-adiccompletion $\l\hat{\lambda}_{a}(m)$ has finitely generated cohomologies over$\hat{a}$. the first result is a far reaching generalization of a result ofserre, who proved this in case $k$ is a field or a discrete valuation ring and$a = k[[x_1,\dots,x_n]]$.
