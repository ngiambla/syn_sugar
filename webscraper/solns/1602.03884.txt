conformal loop ensembles are random collections of loops in a simplyconnected domain, whose laws are characterized by a natural conformalinvariance property. the set of points not surrounded by any cle loop is anatural random and conformally invariant analog of the sierpinski gasket orcarpet.  in the present paper, we derive a direct relationship between each cleconsisting of simple disjoint loops (cle($\kappa$) with $\kappa$ between 8/3and 4) and the corresponding cle($\kappa'$) where $\kappa':=16/\kappa$, a cleconsisting of non-disjoint loops. this is the continuum analog of theedwards-sokal coupling (between the q-state potts model and the associated fkrandom cluster model) and its generalization to non-integer q.  like its discrete analog, our continuum correspondence has two directions.first, we show that one can construct (variants of) cle($\kappa$) as follows:sample a cle($\kappa'$), then use a biased coin to independently color eachloop one of two colors, and then consider the outer boundaries of the clustersof loops of a given color. second, we show how to interpret cle($\kappa'$)loops as interfaces of a continuum analog of critical percolation within acle($\kappa)$ carpet. this is the first description of continuous percolationinterfaces in fractal domains.  these constructions provide new interpretations of the relationship betweencles and the gaussian free field. along the way, we obtain results aboutgeneralized sle$(\kappa;\rho)$ curves, and define a continuous family ofnatural cle variants called boundary conformal loop ensembles (bcles) thatshare some (but not all) of the conformal symmetries that characterize cles,and that should be scaling limits of critical models with special boundaryconditions. we extend the cle correspondence to a bcle correspondence thatmakes sense for all $\kappa$ between 2 and 4.
