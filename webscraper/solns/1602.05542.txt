we prove that in the moduli space of genus-g metric graphs the locus ofgraphs with gonality at most d has the classical dimension min{3g-3,2g+2d-5}.this follows from a careful parameter count to establish the upper bound and aconstruction of sufficiently many graphs with gonality at most d to establishthe lower bound. here, gonality is the minimal degree of a non-degenerateharmonic map to a tree that satisfies the riemann-hurwitz condition everywhere.along the way, we establish a convenient combinatorial datum capturing suchharmonic maps to trees.
