let $f\colon m\to n$ be a proper map between two aspherical compactorientable 3-manifolds with empty or toroidal boundary. we assume that $n$ isnot a closed graph-manifold. suppose that $f$ induces an epimorphism onfundamental groups. we show that $f$ is homotopic to a homeomorphism if one ofthe following holds: either for any finite-index subgroup $\gamma$ of$\pi_1(n)$ the ranks of $\gamma$ and of $f_*^{-1}(\gamma)$ agree, or for anyfinite cover $\tilde{n}$ of $n$ the heegaard genus of $\tilde{n}$ and theheegaard genus of the pull-back cover $\tilde{m}$ agree.
