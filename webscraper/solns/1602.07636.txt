recently, random access protocols have acquired a new wave of interest, notonly from the satellite communication community, but also from researchersactive in fields like internet of things and machine-to-machine. asynchronous(slot- and frame-wise) aloha-like random access protocols, are very attractivefor such applications, enabling low complexity transmitters and avoiding timesynchronization requirements. evolutions of aloha employ time diversity throughproactive replication of packets, but the time diversity is not fully exploitedat the receiver. combining techniques, as selection combining and maximal-ratiocombining, are beneficial and are adopted in the enhanced contention resolutionaloha (ecra) scheme, presented here. a tight approximation of the packet lossrate for asynchronous random access, including ecra, well suited for the lowchannel load region is derived. finally, ecra is evaluated in terms of spectralefficiency, throughput and packet loss rate in comparison with recentprotocols, showing that it is able to largely outperform both slottedsynchronous and asynchronous schemes.
