we examine a discrete version of the two-dimensional nonlinear $o(3)$ sigmamodel derived from discrete complex analysis. we adopt two lattices, onerectangular, the other polar. we define a discrete energy $e({f})^{\rm disc.}$and a discrete area ${\cal{a}}({f})^{\rm disc.}$, where the function $f$ isrelated to a stereographic projection governed by a unit vector of the model.the discrete energy and area satisfy the inequality $e({f})^{\rm disc.} \ge|{\cal{a}}({f})^{\rm disc.}|$, which is saturated if and only if the function$f$ is discrete (anti-)holomorphic. we show for the rectangular lattice that,except for a factor 2, the discrete energy and the area tend to the usualcontinuous energy $e({f})$ and the area ${\cal{a}}({f})=4 \pi n, \,\,n\in\pi_2(s^2)$ as the lattice spacings tend to zero. in the polar lattice, wesection the plane by $2m$ lines passing through the origin into $2m$ equalsectors and place vertices radially in a geometric progression with a commonratio $q$. for this polar lattice, the euler--lagrange equation derived fromthe discrete energy $e({f})^{\rm disc.}$ yields rotationally symmetric(anti-)holomorphic solutions $f(z)=cz^{\pm 1}\,\,(c\bar{z}^{\pm 1})$ in thezeroth order of $\kappa:=q^{-1}-q$. we find that the discrete area evaluated bythese zeroth-order solutions is expressible as a $q$-integral (the jacksonintegral). moreover, the area tends to $\pm 2\cdot 4\pi$ in the continuum limit($m \to \infty$ and $q \to 1\!-0$) with fixed discrete conformal structure$\rho_0 =2 \sin{(\pi/m)}/ \kappa$.
