in this article, we prove that if a finitely generated group $g$ is nottorsion then a necessary and sufficient condition for every full shift over $g$has (continuous) cocycle superrigidity is that $g$ has one end. it is atopological version of the well known popa's measurable cocycle superrigiditytheorem. for the proof of sufficient condition, we introduce a newspecification property for shifts over general groups which play a similar roleas malleable property in the measurable setting. this new specificationproperty is good enough for us to extend the method using homoclinicequivalence relation that was introduced by klaus schmidt to study cocyclerigidity for $\mathbb{z}^d$-shifts. indeed, in this direction we prove thissuperrigidity result for more certain general systems. and for the converse, weapply specker's characterization for ends of groups via the associated firstcohomology groups to get the result. finally, combining our results with aresult of xin li, we have an application in continuous orbit equivalencerigidity.
