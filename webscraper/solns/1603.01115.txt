in this paper, we study wireless networks where nodes have two energysources, namely a battery and radio frequency (rf) energy harvesting circuitry.we formulate two optimization problems with different objective functions,namely maximizing the sum throughput and maximizing the minimum throughput, forenhanced fairness. furthermore, we show the generality of the proposed systemmodel through characterizing the conditions under which the two formulatedoptimization problems can be reduced to the corresponding problems of differentknown wireless networks, namely, conventional wireless networks(battery-powered) and wireless powered communications networks (wpcns) withonly rf energy harvesting nodes. in addition, we introduce wpcns with two typesof nodes, with and without rf energy harvesting capability, in which the nodeswithout rf energy harvesting are utilized to enhance the sum throughput, evenbeyond wpcns with all energy harvesting nodes. we establish the convexity ofall formulated problems which opens room for efficient solution using standardtechniques. our numerical results show that the two types of wireless networks,namely wpcns with only rf energy harvesting nodes and conventional wirelessnetworks, are considered, respectively, as lower and upper bounds on theperformance of the generalized problem setting in terms of the maximum sumthroughput and the maxmin throughput. moreover, the results reveal new insightsand throughput-fairness trade-offs unique to our new problem setting.
