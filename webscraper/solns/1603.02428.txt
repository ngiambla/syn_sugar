let $g=(v,e)$ be a simple graph. for any integer $k\geq 1$, a subset of $v$is called a $k$-tuple total dominating set of $g$ if every vertex in $v$ has atleast $k$ neighbors in the set. the minimum cardinality of a minimal $k$-tupletotal dominating set of $g$ is called the $k$-tuple total domination number of$g$. in this paper, we introduce the concept of upper $k$-tuple totaldomination number of $g$ as the maximum cardinality of a minimal $k$-tupletotal dominating set of $g$, and study the problem of finding a minimal$k$-tuple total dominating set of maximum cardinality on several classes ofgraphs, as well as finding general bounds and characterizations. also, we findsome results on the upper $k$-tuple total domination number of the cartesianand cross products of two graphs.
