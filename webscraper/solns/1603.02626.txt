additive utility function models are widely used in multiple criteriadecision analysis. in such models, a numerical value is associated to eachalternative involved in the decision problem. it is computed by aggregating thescores of the alternative on the different criteria of the decision problem.the score of an alternative is determined by a marginal value function thatevolves monotonically as a function of the performance of the alternative onthis criterion. determining the shape of the marginals is not easy for adecision maker. it is easier for him/her to make statements such as"alternative $a$ is preferred to $b$". in order to help the decision maker, utadisaggregation procedures use linear programming to approximate the marginalsby piecewise linear functions based only on such statements. in this paper, wepropose to infer polynomials and splines instead of piecewise linear functionsfor the marginals. in this aim, we use semidefinite programming instead oflinear programming. we illustrate this new elicitation method and present someexperimental results.
