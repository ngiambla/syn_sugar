we study a 1d transport equation with nonlocal velocity with subcritical orsupercritical dissipation. for all data in the weighted sobolev space$h^{k}(w_{\lambda,\kappa}) \cap l^{\infty},$ with $k=\max(0,3/2-\alpha)$ and$w_{\lambda, \kappa}$ is a given family of muckenhoupt weights. we prove aglobal existence result in the subcritical case $\alpha \in (1,2)$. we alsoprove a local existence theorem for large data in $h^{2}(w_{\lambda,\kappa})\cap l^{\infty}$ in the supercritical case $\alpha \in (0,1)$. theproofs are based on the use of the weighted littlewood-paley theory,interpolation along with some new commutator estimates.
