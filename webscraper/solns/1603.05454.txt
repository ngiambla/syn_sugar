the quantum problem of an electron moving in a plane under the field createdby two coulombian centers admits simple analytical solutions for someparticular inter-center distances. these elementary eigenfunctions, akin tothose found by demkov for the analogous three dimensional problem, arecalculated using the framework of quasi-exact solvability of a pair ofentangled ode's descendants from the heun equation. a different but interestingsituation arises when the two centers have the same strength. in this casecompletely elementary solutions do not exist.
