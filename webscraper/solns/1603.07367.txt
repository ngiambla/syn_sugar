we develop a universal distributional calculus for regulated volumes ofmetrics that are singular along hypersurfaces. when the hypersurface is aconformal infinity we give simple integrated distribution expressions for thedivergences and anomaly of the regulated volume functional valid for any choiceof regulator. for closed hypersurfaces or conformally compact geometries,methods from a previously developed boundary calculus for conformally compactmanifolds can be applied to give explicit holographic formulae for thedivergences and anomaly expressed as hypersurface integrals over localquantities (the method also extends to non-closed hypersurfaces). the resultinganomaly does not depend on any particular choice of regulator, while theregulator dependence of the divergences is precisely captured by theseformulae. conformal hypersurface invariants can be studied by demanding thatthe singular metric obey, smoothly and formally to a suitable order, a yamabetype problem with boundary data along the conformal infinity. we prove that thevolume anomaly for these singular yamabe solutions is a conformally invariantintegral of a local q-curvature that generalizes the branson q-curvature byincluding data of the embedding. in each dimension this canonically defines ahigher dimensional generalization of the willmore energy/rigid string action.recently graham proved that the first variation of the volume anomaly recoversthe density obstructing smooth solutions to this singular yamabe problem; wegive a new proof of this result employing our boundary calculus. physicalapplications of our results include studies of quantum corrections toentanglement entropies.
