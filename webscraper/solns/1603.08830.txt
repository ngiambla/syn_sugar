a simple, intuitive approach to the assessment of probabilistic inferences isintroduced. the shannon information metrics are translated to the probabilitydomain. the translation shows that the negative logarithmic score and thegeometric mean are equivalent measures of the accuracy of a probabilisticinference. thus there is both a quantitative reduction in perplexity as goodinference algorithms reduce the uncertainty and a qualitative reduction due tothe increased clarity between the original set of inferences and their average,the geometric mean. further insight is provided by showing that the renyi andtsallis entropy functions translated to the probability domain are both theweighted generalized mean of the distribution. the generalized mean ofprobabilistic inferences forms a risk profile of the performance. thearithmetic mean is used to measure the decisiveness, while the -2/3 mean isused to measure the robustness.
