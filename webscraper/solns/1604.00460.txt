we investigate the connectivity of a wireless sensor network secured by theheterogeneous key predistribution scheme under an independent on/off channelmodel. the heterogeneous scheme induces an inhomogeneous random key graph,denoted by $\mathbb{k}(n;\pmb{\mu},\pmb{k},p)$ and the on/off channel modelinduces an erd\h{o}s-r\'enyi graph, denoted by $\mathbb{h}(n,\alpha)$. hence,the overall random graph modeling the wsn is obtained by the intersection of$\mathbb{k}(n;\pmb{\mu},\pmb{k},p)$ and $\mathbb{h}(n,\alpha)$. we presentconditions on how to scale the parameters of the intersecting graph withrespect to the network size $n$ such that the graph i) has no isolated nodesand ii) is connected, both with high probability as the number of nodes getslarge. our results are supported by a simulation study demonstrating that i)despite their asymptotic nature, our results can in fact be useful in designingfinite-node wireless sensor networks so that they achieve secure connectivitywith high probability; and ii) despite the simplicity of the on/offcommunication model, the probability of connectivity in the resulting wirelesssensor network approximates very well the case where the disk model is used.
