  human flourishing is often severely limited by persistent violence.
quantitative conflict research has found common temporal and other statistical
patterns in warfare, but very little is understood about its general spatial
patterns. while the importance of topology in geostrategy has long been
recognised, the role of spatial patterns of cities in determining a region's
vulnerability to conflict has gone unexplored. here, we show that global
patterns in war and peace are closely related to the relative position of
cities in a global interaction network. we find that regions with betweenness
centrality above a certain threshold are often engulfed in entrenched conflict,
while a high degree correlates with peace. in fact, betweenness accounts for
over 80% of the variance in number of attacks. this metric is also a good
predictor of the distance to a conflict zone and can estimate the risk of
conflict. we conjecture that a high betweenness identifies areas with fuzzy
cultural boundaries, whereas high degree cities are in cores where peace is
more easily maintained. this is supported by a simple agent-based model in
which cities influence their neighbours, which exhibits the same threshold
behaviour with betweenness as seen in conflict data. these findings not only
shed new light on the causes of violence, but could be used to estimate the
risk associated with actions such as the merging of cities, construction of
transportation infrastructure, or interventions in trade or migration patterns.
