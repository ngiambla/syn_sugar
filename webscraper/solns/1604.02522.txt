musicologists and sociologists have long been interested in patterns of musicconsumption and their relation to socioeconomic status. in particular, theomnivore thesis examines the relationship between these variables and thediversity of music a person consumes. using data from social media users oflast.fm and twitter, we design and evaluate a measure that reasonably capturesdiversity of musical tastes. we use that measure to explore associationsbetween musical diversity and variables that capture socioeconomic status,demographics, and personal traits such as openness and degree of interest inmusic (into-ness). our musical diversity measure can provide a useful means forstudies of musical preferences and consumption. also, our study of the omnivorethesis provides insights that extend previous survey and interview-basedstudies.
