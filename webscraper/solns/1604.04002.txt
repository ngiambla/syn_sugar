we consider the estimation of the transition matrix in the high-dimensionaltime-varying vector autoregression (tv-var) models. our model builds on ageneral class of locally stationary var processes that evolve smoothly in time.we propose a hybridized kernel smoothing and $\ell^1$-regularized method todirectly estimate the sequence of time-varying transition matrices. under thesparsity assumption on the transition matrix, we establish the rate ofconvergence of the proposed estimator and show that the convergence ratedepends on the smoothness of the locally stationary var processes only throughthe smoothness of the transition matrix function. in addition, for ourestimator followed by thresholding, we prove that the false positive rate (typei error) and false negative rate (type ii error) in the pattern recovery canasymptotically vanish in the presence of weak signals without assuming theminimum nonzero signal strength condition. favorable finite sample performancesover the $\ell^2$-penalized least-squares estimator and the unstructuredmaximum likelihood estimator are shown on simulated data. we also provide tworeal examples on estimating the dependence structures on financial stock pricesand economic exchange rates datasets.
