two optimization algorithms are proposed for solving a stochastic programmingproblem for which the objective function is given in the form of theexpectation of convex functions and the constraint set is defined by theintersection of fixed point sets of nonexpansive mappings in a real hilbertspace. this setting of fixed point constraints enables consideration of thecase in which the projection onto each of the constraint sets cannot becomputed efficiently. both algorithms use a convex function and a nonexpansivemapping determined by a certain probabilistic process at each iteration. onealgorithm blends a stochastic gradient method with the halpern fixed pointalgorithm. the other is based on a stochastic proximal point algorithm and thehalpern fixed point algorithm; it can be applied to nonsmooth convexoptimization. convergence analysis showed that, under certain assumptions, anyweak sequential cluster point of the sequence generated by either algorithmalmost surely belongs to the solution set of the problem. convergence rateanalysis illustrated their efficiency, and the numerical results of convexoptimization over fixed point sets demonstrated their effectiveness.
