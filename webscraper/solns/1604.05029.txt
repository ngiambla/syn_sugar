for the super-hyperbolic space in any dimension, we introduce thenon-euclidean helgason--fourier transform. we prove an inversion formulaexhibiting residue contributions at the poles of the harish-chandra c-function,signalling discrete parts in the spectrum. the proof is based on a detailedstudy of the spherical superfunctions, using recursion relations andlocalization techniques to normalize them precisely, careful estimates of theirderivatives, and a rigorous analysis of the boundary terms appearing in thepolar coordinate expression of the invariant integral
