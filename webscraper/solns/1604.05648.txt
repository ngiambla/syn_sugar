we introduce a novel first-order stochastic swarm intelligence (si) model inthe spirit of consensus formation models, namely a consensus-based optimization(cbo) algorithm, which may be used for the global optimization of a function inmultiple dimensions. the cbo algorithm allows for passage to the mean-fieldlimit, which results in a nonstandard, nonlocal, degenerate parabolic partialdifferential equation (pde). exploiting tools from pde analysis we provideconvergence results that help to understand the asymptotic behavior of the simodel. we further present numerical investigations underlining the feasibilityof our approach.
