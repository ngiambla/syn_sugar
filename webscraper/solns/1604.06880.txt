we classify the admissible transformations in a class of variable coefficientkorteweg--de vries equations. as a result, full description of the structure ofthe equivalence groupoid of the class is given. the class under study ispartitioned into six disjoint normalized subclasses. the widest possibleequivalence group for each subclass is found which appears to be generalizedextended in five cases. ways for improvement of transformational properties ofthe subclasses are proposed using gaugings of arbitrary elements and mappingbetween classes. the group classification of one of the subclasses is carriedout as an illustrative example.
