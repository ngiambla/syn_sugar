in this paper, we introduce the concept of spatially coupled turbo-like codes(sc-tcs) as the spatial coupling of a number of turbo-like code ensembles. inparticular, we consider the spatial coupling of berrou et al. parallelconcatenated codes (pccs) and benedetto et al. serially concatenated codes(sccs). furthermore, we propose two extensions of braided convolutional codes(bccs), a class of turbo-like codes which have an inherent spatially coupledstructure, to higher coupling memories, and show that these yield improvedbelief propagation (bp) thresholds as compared to the original bcc ensemble. wederive the exact density evolution (de) equations for sc-tcs and analyze theirasymptotic behavior on the binary erasure channel. we also consider theconstruction of families of rate-compatible sc-tc ensembles. our numericalresults show that threshold saturation of the belief propagation (bp) decodingthreshold to the maximum a-posteriori threshold of the underlying uncoupledensembles occurs for large enough coupling memory. the improvement of the bpthreshold is especially significant for sccs and bccs, whose uncoupledensembles suffer from a poor bp threshold. for a wide range of code rates,sc-tcs show close-to-capacity performance as the coupling memory increases. wefurther give a proof of threshold saturation for sc-tc ensembles with identicalcomponent encoders. in particular, we show that the de of sc-tc ensembles withidentical component encoders can be properly rewritten as a scalar recursion.this allows us to define potential functions and prove threshold saturationusing the proof technique recently introduced by yedla et al..
