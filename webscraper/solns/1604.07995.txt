we study the recently introduced inverse-beta polymer, an exactly solvable,anisotropic finite temperature model of directed polymer on the square lattice,and obtain its stationary measure. in parallel we introduce an anisotropic zerotemperature model of directed polymer on the square lattice, thebernoulli-geometric polymer, and obtain its stationary measure. this newexactly solvable model is dual to the inverse-beta polymer and interpolatesbetween models of first and last passage percolation on the square lattice.both stationary measures are shown to satisfy detailed balance. we also obtainthe asymptotic mean value of (i) the free-energy of the inverse-beta polymer;(ii) the optimal energy of the bernoulli-geometric polymer. we discuss theconvergence of both models to their stationary state. we perform simulations ofthe bernoulli-geometric polymer that confirm our results.
