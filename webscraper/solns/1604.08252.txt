we prove a complex ruelle-perron-frobenius theorem for markov shifts over aninfinite alphabet, whence extending results by m. pollicott from the finite tothe infinite alphabet setting. as an application we obtain an extension ofrenewal theory in symbolic dynamics, as developed by s. p. lalley and in thesequel generalised by the second author, now covering the infinite alphabetcase.
