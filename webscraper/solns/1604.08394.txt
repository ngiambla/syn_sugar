  socioeconomic inequalities in cities are embedded in space and result in
neighborhood effects, whose harmful consequences have proved very hard to
counterbalance efficiently by planning policies alone. considering
redistribution of money flows as a first step toward improved spatial equity,
we study a bottom-up approach that would rely on a slight evolution of shopping
mobility practices. building on a database of anonymized credit card
transactions in madrid and barcelona, we quantify the mobility effort required
to reach a reference situation where commercial income is evenly shared among
neighborhoods. the redirections of shopping trips preserve key properties of
human mobility, including travel distances. surprisingly, for both cities only
a small fraction ($\sim 5 \%$) of trips need to be altered to reach equity
situations, improving even other sustainability indicators. the method could be
implemented in mobile applications that would assist individuals in reshaping
their shopping practices, to promote the spatial redistribution of
opportunities in the city.
