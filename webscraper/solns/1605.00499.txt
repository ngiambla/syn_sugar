in complicated/nonlinear parametric models, it is generally hard to knowwhether the model parameters are point identified. we provide computationallyattractive procedures to construct confidence sets (css) for identified sets offull parameters and of subvectors in models defined through a likelihood or avector of moment equalities or inequalities. these css are based on level setsof optimal sample criterion functions (such as likelihood or optimally-weightedor continuously-updated gmm criterions). the level sets are constructed usingcutoffs that are computed via monte carlo (mc) simulations directly from thequasi-posterior distributions of the criterions. we establish new bernstein-vonmises (or bayesian wilks) type theorems for the quasi-posterior distributionsof the quasi-likelihood ratio (qlr) and profile qlr in partially-identifiedregular models and some non-regular models. these results imply that our mc csshave exact asymptotic frequentist coverage for identified sets of fullparameters and of subvectors in partially-identified regular models, and havevalid but potentially conservative coverage in models with reduced-formparameters on the boundary. our mc css for identified sets of subvectors areshown to have exact asymptotic coverage in models with singularities. we alsoprovide results on uniform validity of our css over classes of dgps thatinclude point and partially identified models. we demonstrate goodfinite-sample coverage properties of our procedures in two simulationexperiments. finally, our procedures are applied to two non-trivial empiricalexamples: an airline entry game and a model of trade flows.
