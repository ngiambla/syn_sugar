we construct a finitely generated group which is an extension of two finitelygenerated groups coarsely embeddable into hilbert space but which itself doesnot coarsely embed into hilbert space. our construction also provides a newinfinite monster group: the first example of a finitely generated group thatdoes not coarsely embed into hilbert space and yet does not contain a weaklyembedded expander.
