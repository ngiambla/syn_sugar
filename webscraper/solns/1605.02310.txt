in this paper, we proved a central limit theorem and established a moderatedeviation principle for a perturbed stochastic wave equation defined on$[0,t]\times \rr^3$. this equation is driven by a gaussian noise, white in timeand correlated in space. the weak convergence approach plays an important role.
