let x and y be two independent and nonnegative random variables withcorresponding distributions f and g. denote by h the distribution of theproduct xy , called the product convolution of f and g. cline and samorodnitsky(1994) proposed sufficient conditions for h to be subexponential, given thesubexponentiality of f. relying on a related result of tang (2008) on thelong-tail of product convolution, we obtain a necessary and sufficientcondition for the subexponentiality of h, given that of f. we also study thereverse problem and obtain sufficient conditions for the subexponentiality of fgiven that of h. finally, we apply the obtained results to the asymptotic studyof the ruin probability in a discrete-time insurance risk model with stochasticreturns.
