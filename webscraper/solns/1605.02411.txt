we introduce and discuss two nonlinear perturbed extensions of thecucker-smale model with asymmetric coupling weights. the first model assumes afinite collection of autonomous agents aiming to perform a consensus process inthe presence of identical internal dynamics. the second model describes asimilar population of agents that perform velocity alignment with therestriction of collision-free orbits. although qualitatively different, weexplain how these two non-trivial types of perturbations are analyzed under aunified framework. rigorous analysis is conducted towards establishing newsufficient conditions for asymptotic flocking to a synchronized motion.applications of our results are compared with simulations to illustrate theeffectiveness of our theoretical estimates.
