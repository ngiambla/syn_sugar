we prove an analogue of a theorem of eskin-margulis-mozes: suppose we aregiven a finite set of places $s$ over $\mathbb{q}$ containing the archimedeanplace and excluding the prime $2$, an irrational isotropic form ${{\mathbf q}}$of rank $n\geq 4$ on $\mathbb{q}_s$, a product of $p$-adic intervals $i_p$, anda product $\omega$ of star-shaped sets.  we show that unless $n=4$ and ${{\mathbf q}}$ is split in at least one place,the number of $s$-integral vectors ${\mathbf v} \in {\mathsf{t}} \omega$satisfying simultaneously ${\mathbf q}( {\mathbf v} ) \in i_p$ for $p \in s$ isasymptotically given by $$  \lambda({\mathbf q}, \omega) | i| \cdot \prod_{p\in s_f} t_p^{n-2},$$ as${\mathsf{t}}$ goes to infinity, where $| i |$ is the product of haar measuresof the $p$-adic intervals $i_p$.  the proof uses dynamics of unipotent flows on $s$-arithmetic homogeneousspaces; in particular, it relies on an equidistribution result for certaintranslates of orbits applied to test functions with a controlled growth atinfinity, specified by an $s$-arithmetic variant of the $ \alpha$-functionintroduced in the work of eskin, margulis, mozes, and an $s$-arithemtic versionof a theorem of dani-margulis.
