we consider the sequential decision problem faced by the manager of anelectric vehicle (ev) charging station, who aims to satisfy the charging demandof the customer while minimizing cost. since the total time needed to chargethe ev up to capacity is often less than the amount of time that the customeris away, there are opportunities to exploit electricity spot price variationswithin some reservation window. we formulate the problem as a finite horizonmarkov decision process (mdp) and consider a risk-averse objective function byoptimizing under a dynamic risk measure constructed using a convex combinationof expected value and conditional value at risk (cvar). it has been recognizedthat the objective function of a risk-averse mdp lacks a practicalinterpretation. therefore, in both academic and industry practice, the dynamicrisk measure objective is often not of primary interest; instead, therisk-averse mdp is used as a computational tool for solving problems withpredefined "practical" risk and reward objectives (termed the base model). inthis paper, we study the extent to which the two sides of this framework arecompatible with each other for the ev setting -- roughly speaking, does a "morerisk-averse" mdp provide lower risk in the practical sense as well? in order toanswer such a question, the effect of the degree of dynamic risk-aversion onthe optimal mdp policy is analyzed. based on these results, we also propose aprincipled approximation approach to finding an instance of the risk-averse mdpwhose optimal policy behaves well under the practical objectives of the basemodel. our numerical experiments suggest that ev charging stations can beoperated at a significantly higher level of profitability if dynamic chargingis adopted and a small amount of risk is tolerated.
