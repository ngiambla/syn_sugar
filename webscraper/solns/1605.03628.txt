the batched greedy strategy is an approximation algorithm to maximize a setfunction subject to a matroid constraint. starting with the empty set, thebatched greedy strategy iteratively adds to the current solution set a batch ofelements that results in the largest gain in the objective function whilesatisfying the matroid constraints. in this paper, we develop bounds on theperformance of the batched greedy strategy relative to the optimal strategy interms of a parameter called the total batched curvature. we show that when theobjective function is a polymatroid set function, the batched greedy strategysatisfies a harmonic bound for a general matroid constraint and an exponentialbound for a uniform matroid constraint, both in terms of the total batchedcurvature. we also study the behavior of the bounds as functions of the batchsize. specifically, we prove that the harmonic bound for a general matroid isnondecreasing in the batch size and the exponential bound for a uniform matroidis nondecreasing in the batch size under the condition that the batch sizedivides the rank of the uniform matroid. finally, we illustrate our results byconsidering a task scheduling problem and an adaptive sensing problem.
