in this paper we focus on regional deterministic optimal control problems,i.e., problems where the dynamics and the cost functional may be different inseveral regions of the state space and present discontinuities at theirinterface. under the assumption that optimal trajectories have a locally finitenumber of switchings (no zeno phenomenon), we use the duplication technique toshow that the value function of the regional optimal control problem is theminimum over all possible structures of trajectories of value functionsassociated with classical optimal control problems settled over fixedstructures, each of them being the restriction to some submanifold of the valuefunction of a classical optimal control problem in higher dimension.the liftingduplication technique is thus seen as a kind of desingularization of the valuefunction of the regional optimal control problem. in turn, we extend toregional optimal control problems the classical sensitivity relations and weprove that the regularity of this value function is the same (i.e., is not moredegenerate) than the one of the higher-dimensional classical optimal controlproblem that lifts the problem.
