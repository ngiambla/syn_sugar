we develop sufficient analytic conditions for conservativeness ofnon-sectorial perturbations of symmetric dirichlet forms which can berepresented through a carr\'e du champ on a locally compact separable metricspace. these form an important subclass of generalized dirichlet forms whichwere introduced in \cite{st1}. in case there exists an associated strong fellerprocess, the analytic conditions imply conservativeness, i.e. non-explosion ofthe associated process in the classical probabilistic sense. as an applicationof our general results on locally compact separable metric state spaces, weconsider a generalized dirichlet form given on a closed or open subset of$\mathbb{r}^d$ which is given as a divergence free first order perturbation ofa symmetric energy form. then using volume growth conditions of the carr\'e duchamp and the non-sectorial first order part, we derive an explicit criterionfor conservativeness. we present several concrete examples which relate ourresults to previous ones obtained by different authors. in particular, we showthat conservativeness can hold for a cubic variance if the drift is strongenough to compensate it. this work continues our previous work on transienceand recurrence of generalized dirichlet forms.
