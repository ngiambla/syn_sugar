we study how the systole of principal congruence coverings of a hilbertmodular variety grows when the degree of the covering goes to infinity. weprove that given a hilbert modular variety $m$ of real dimension $2n$, thesequence of principal congruence coverings $m_{i}$ eventually satisfies$$sys\pi_{1}(m_{i})\geq \frac{4}{3\sqrt{n}}\log(vol(m_{i}))-c,$$ where $c$ is aconstant independent of $m_{i}$.
