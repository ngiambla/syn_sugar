i construct a generalisation of mantovan's almost product structure toshimura varieties of hodge type with hyperspecial level structure at $p$ anddeduce that the perfection of the newton strata are pro-\'etale locallyisomorphic to the perfection of the product of a central leaf and arapoport-zink space. the almost product formula can be extended to obtain ananalogue of caraiani's and scholze's generalisation of the almost productstructure for shimura varieties of hodge type.
