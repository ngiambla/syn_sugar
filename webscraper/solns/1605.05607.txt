we give a simultaneous generalization of exact categories and triangulatedcategories, which is suitable for considering cotorsion pairs, and which wecall extriangulated categories. extension-closed, full subcategories oftriangulated categories are examples of extriangulated categories. we give abijective correspondence between some pairs of cotorsion pairs which we callhovey twin cotorsion pairs, and admissible model structures. as a consequence,these model structures relate certain localizations with certain idealquotients, via the homotopy category which can be given a triangulatedstructure. this gives a natural framework to formulate reduction and mutationof cotorsion pairs, applicable to both exact categories and triangulatedcategories. these results can be thought of as arguments towards the view thatextriangulated categories are a convenient setup for writing down proofs whichapply to both exact categories and (extension-closed subcategories of)triangulated categories.
