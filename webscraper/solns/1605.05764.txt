we study the problem of packing arborescences in the random digraph $\mathcald(n,p)$, where each possible arc is included uniformly at random withprobability $p=p(n)$. let $\lambda(\mathcal d(n,p))$ denote the largest integer$\lambda\geq 0$ such that, for all $0\leq \ell\leq \lambda$, we have$\sum_{i=0}^{\ell-1} (\ell-i)|\{v: d^{in}(v) = i\}| \leq \ell$. we show thatthe maximum number of arc-disjoint arborescences in $\mathcal d(n,p)$ is$\lambda(\mathcal d(n,p))$ a.a.s. we also give tight estimates for$\lambda(\mathcal d(n,p))$ depending on the range of $p$.
