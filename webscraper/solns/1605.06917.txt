we introduce the concept of weakly markov dynamical systems. we study forthese systems the asymptotic behaviour of the distribution of first returntimes to shrinking balls. we prove for most balls its convergence to theexponential law. we obtain this for sets of radii with relative lebesguemeasure converging very fast to one.  we show that several classes of smooth dynamical systems are weakly markov:expanding repellers, conformal ifss, rational functions on $\widehat{c}$ andmany more.  for the conformal dynamical systems we in fact prove much more, namely thatthe convergence to the exponential law is along all radii. up to our bestknowledge any results achieving all radii have been hitherto known only inspecial cases (e.g. the invariant measure equivalent to an ahlfors one). weobtain the convergence along all radii by proving the full thin annuliproperty, the property interesting on its own.
