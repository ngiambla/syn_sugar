we consider the problem of estimating a low-rank signal matrix from noisymeasurements under the assumption that the distribution of the data matrixbelongs to an exponential family. in this setting, we derive generalizedstein's unbiased risk estimation (sure) formulas that hold for any spectralestimators which shrink or threshold the singular values of the data matrix.this leads to new data-driven spectral estimators, whose optimality isdiscussed using tools from random matrix theory and through numericalexperiments. under the spiked population model and in the asymptotic settingwhere the dimensions of the data matrix are let going to infinity, sometheoretical properties of our approach are compared to recent results onasymptotically optimal shrinking rules for gaussian noise. it also leads to newprocedures for singular values shrinkage in finite-dimensional matrix denoisingfor gamma-distributed and poisson-distributed measurements.
