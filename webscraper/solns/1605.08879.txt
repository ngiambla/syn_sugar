hazewinkel proved the ditters conjecture that the algebra of quasisymmetricfunctions over the integers is free commutative by constructing a nicepolynomial basis. in this paper we prove a structure theorem for the algebra ofpeak quasisymmetric functions (pqsym) over the integers. it provides apolynomial basis of pqsym over the rational field, different from hsiao'sbasis, and implies the freeness of pqsym over its subring of symmetricfunctions spanned by schur's q-functions.
