floating point arithmetic allows us to use a finite machine, the digitalcomputer, to reach conclusions about models based on continuous mathematics. inthis article we work in the other direction, that is, we present examples inwhich continuous mathematics leads to sharp, simple and new results about theevaluation of sums, square roots and dot products in floating point arithmetic.
