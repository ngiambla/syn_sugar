for a cohen-macaulay ideal of holomorphic functions, we construct byelementary means residue currents whose annihilator is precisely the givenideal. we give two proofs that the currents have the prescribed annihilator,one using the theory of linkage, and another using an explicit division formulainvolving these residue currents to express the ideal membership.
