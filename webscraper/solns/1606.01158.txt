the weil-petersson and takhtajan-zograf metrics on the riemann moduli spacesof complex structures for an $n$-fold punctured oriented surface of genus $g,$in the stable range $g+2n>2,$ are shown here to have complete asymptoticexpansions in terms of fenchel-nielsen coordinates at the exceptional divisorsof the knudsen-deligne-mumford compactification. this is accomplished byfinding a full expansion for the hyperbolic metrics on the fibers of theuniversal curve as they approach the complete metrics on the nodal curves abovethe exceptional divisors and then using a push-forward theorem for conormaldensities. this refines a two-term expansion due to obitsu-wolpert for theconformal factor relative to the model plumbing metric which in turn refinedthe bound obtained by masur. a similar expansion for the ricci metric is alsoobtained.
