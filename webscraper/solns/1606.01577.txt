we prove a version of the moving particle lemma for the exclusion process onany finite weighted graph, based on the octopus inequality of caputo, liggett,and richthammer. in light of their proof of aldous' spectral gap conjecture, weconjecture that our moving particle lemma is optimal in general. our result canbe applied to graphs which lack translational invariance, including, but notlimited to, fractal graphs. an application of our result is the proof of localergodicity for the exclusion process on a class of weighted graphs, the detailsof which are reported in a follow-up paper [arxiv:1705.10290].
