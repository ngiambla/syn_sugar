we prove a 1979 conjecture of lusztig on the cohomology of semi-infinitedeligne--lusztig varieties attached to division algebras over local fields. wealso prove the two conjectures of boyarchenko on these varieties. it is knownthat in this setting, the semi-infinite deligne--lusztig varieties areind-schemes comprised of limits of certain finite-type schemes $x_h$.boyarchenko's two conjectures are on the maximality of $x_h$ and on thebehavior of the torus-eigenspaces of their cohomology. both of theseconjectures were known in full generality only for division algebras with hasseinvariant $1/n$ in the case $h = 2$ (the "lowest level") by the work ofboyarchenko--weinstein on the cohomology of a special affinoid in thelubin--tate tower. we prove that the number of rational points of $x_h$ attainsits weil--deligne bound, so that the cohomology of $x_h$ is pure in a verystrong sense. we prove that the torus-eigenspaces of $h_c^i(x_h)$ areirreducible representations and are supported in exactly one cohomologicaldegree. finally, we give a complete description of the homology groups of thesemi-infinite deligne--lusztig varieties attached to any division algebra, thusgiving a geometric realization of the unramified supercuspidal representationsof these groups. we expect that the techniques developed in this paper will beuseful in studying these constructions for reductive groups over local fieldsin general.
