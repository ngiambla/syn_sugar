  we discuss how to use evolutionary game theory (egt) as a framework for
studying how cultural dynamics and structural properties can influence the
evolution of norms and behaviors within a society. we provide a brief tutorial
on how egt works, and discuss what kinds of insights it can provide. we then
describe three published studies in which we have developed egt models that
help explain how structural and external conditions in a society affect the
emergence of social norms.
