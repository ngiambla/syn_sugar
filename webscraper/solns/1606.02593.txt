in this article we relate the set of structure preserving equivalentmartingale measures $(\mathcal{m})$ for financial models driven bysemimartingales with conditionally independent increments to a set ofmeasurable and integrable functions $(\mathscr{y})$. more precisely, we provethat $(\mathcal{m}\not = \emptyset)$ if, and only if, $(\mathscr{y}\not =\emptyset)$, and connect the sets $(\mathcal{m})$ and $(\mathscr{y})$ to thesemimartingale characteristics of the driving process. as examples we considerintegrated l\'evy models with independent stochastic factors and time-changedl\'evy models and derive mild conditions for $(\mathcal{m} \not = \emptyset)$.
