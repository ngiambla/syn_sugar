the existence and uniqueness of solutions to the yang-mills heat equation isproven over three dimensional euclidean space and over a bounded open convexset therein. the initial data is taken to lie in the sobolev space of order onehalf, which is the critical sobolev index for this equation over a threedimensional manifold. the existence is proven by solving first an augmented,strictly parabolic equation and then gauge transforming the solution to asolution of the yang-mills heat equation itself. the gauge functions needed tocarry out this procedure lie in the critical gauge group of sobolev regularitythree halves, which is a complete topological group in a natural metric but isnot a hilbert lie group. the nature of this group must be understood in orderto carry out the reconstruction procedure. solutions to the yang-mills heatequation are shown to be strong solutions modulo these gauge functions. energyinequalities and neumann domination inequalities are used to establish neededinitial behavior properties of solutions to the augmented equation.
