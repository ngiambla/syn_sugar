we consider $\mathbb{r}^d$-valued diffusion processes of type  \begin{align*}  dx_t\ =\ b(x_t)dt\, +\, db_t.  \end{align*} assuming a geometric drift condition, we establish contractionsof the transitions kernels in kantorovich ($l^1$ wasserstein) distances withexplicit constants. our results are in the spirit of hairer and mattingly'sextension of harris' theorem. in particular, they do not rely on a small setcondition. instead we combine lyapunov functions with reflection coupling andconcave distance functions. we retrieve constants that are explicit inparameters which can be computed with little effort from one-sided lipschitzconditions for the drift coefficient and the growth of a chosen lyapunovfunction. consequences include exponential convergence in weighted totalvariation norms, gradient bounds, bounds for ergodic averages, and kantorovichcontractions for nonlinear mckean-vlasov diffusions in the case of sufficientlyweak but not necessarily bounded nonlinearities. we also establish quantitativebounds for sub-geometric ergodicity assuming a sub-geometric drift condition.
