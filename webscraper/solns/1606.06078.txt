we consider densities $d_\sigma(a)$, $\overline{d}_\sigma(a)$ and$\underline{d}_\sigma(a)$ for a subset $a$ of $\mathbb{n}$ with respect to asequence $\sigma$ of finite subsets of $\mathbb{n}$ and study fouriercoefficients of ergodic, weakly mixing and strongly mixing $\times p$-invariantmeasures on the unit circle $\mathbb{t}$. combining these, we prove thefollowing measure rigidity results: on $\mathbb{t}$, the lebesgue measure isthe only non-atomic $\times p$-invariant measure satisfying one of thefollowing: (1) $\mu$ is ergodic and there exist a f\o lner sequence $\sigma$ in$\mathbb{n}$ and a nonzero integer $l$ such that $\mu$ is $\times(p^j+l)$-invariant for all $j$ in a subset $a$ of $\mathbb{n}$ with$d_\sigma(a)=1$; (2) $\mu$ is weakly mixing and there exist a f\o lner sequence$\sigma$ in $\mathbb{n}$ and a nonzero integer $l$ such that $\mu$ is $\times(p^j+l)$-invariant for all $j$ in a subset $a$ of $\mathbb{n}$ with$\overline{d}_\sigma(a)>0$; (3) $\mu$ is strongly mixing and there exists anonzero integer $l$ such that $\mu$ is $\times (p^j+l)$-invariant forinfinitely many $j$. moreover, a $\times p$-invariant measure satisfying (2) or(3) is either a dirac measure or the lebesgue measure.  as an application we prove that for every increasing function $\tau$ definedon positive integers with $\lim_{n\to\infty}\tau(n)=\infty$, there exists amultiplicative semigroup $s_\tau$ of $\mathbb{z}^+$ containing $p$ such that$|s_\tau\cap[1,n]|\leq (\log_p n)^{\tau(n)}$ and the lebesgue measure is theonly non-atomic ergodic $\times p$-invariant measure which is $\timesq$-invariant for all $q$ in $s_\tau$.
