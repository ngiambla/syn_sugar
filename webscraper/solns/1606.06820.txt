since the shooting of black teenager michael brown by white police officerdarren wilson in ferguson, missouri, the protest hashtag #blacklivesmatter hasamplified critiques of extrajudicial killings of black americans. in responseto #blacklivesmatter, other twitter users have adopted #alllivesmatter, acounter-protest hashtag whose content argues that equal attention should begiven to all lives regardless of race. through a multi-level analysis of over860,000 tweets, we study how these protests and counter-protests diverge byquantifying aspects of their discourse. we find that #alllivesmatterfacilitates opposition between #blacklivesmatter and hashtags such as#policelivesmatter and #bluelivesmatter in such a way that historically echoesthe tension between black protesters and law enforcement. in addition, we showthat a significant portion of #alllivesmatter use stems from hijacking by#blacklivesmatter advocates. beyond simply injecting #alllivesmatter with#blacklivesmatter content, these hijackers use the hashtag to directly confrontthe counter-protest notion of "all lives matter." our findings suggest thatblack lives matter movement was able to grow, exhibit diverse conversations,and avoid derailment on social media by making discussion of counter-protestopinions a central topic of #alllivesmatter, rather than the movement itself.
