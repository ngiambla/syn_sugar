it has long been known that the differential operator $d$ represents atypical examples of unbounded operators in many banach spaces including theclassical fock spaces, the fock--sobolev spaces, and the generalized fockspaces where the weight decays faster than the gaussian weight. in this note weidentify fock type spaces where the operator admits some basic spectralstructures including compactness and membership in the schatten $\mathcal{s}_p$classes. we also showed that its nontrivial spectrum while acting on suchspaces is precisely the closed unit disk $\d$ in the complex plane.
