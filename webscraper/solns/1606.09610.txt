  we investigated the feasibility of crowdsourcing full-fledged tutorial videos
from ordinary people on the web on how to solve math problems related to
logarithms. this kind of approach (a form of learnersourcing) to efficiently
collecting tutorial videos and other learning resources could be useful for
realizing personalized learning-at-scale, whereby students receive specific
learning resources -- drawn from a large and diverse set -- that are tailored
to their individual and time-varying needs. results of our study, in which we
collected 399 videos from 66 unique "teachers" on mechanical turk, suggest that
(1) approximately 100 videos -- over $80\%$ of which are mathematically fully
correct -- can be crowdsourced per week for \$5/video; (2) the crowdsourced
videos exhibit significant diversity in terms of language style, presentation
media, and pedagogical approach; (3) the average learning gains (posttest minus
pretest score) associated with watching the videos was stat.~sig.~higher than
for a control video ($0.105$ versus $0.045$); and (4) the average learning
gains ($0.1416$) from watching the best tested crowdsourced videos was
comparable to the learning gains ($0.1506$) from watching a popular khan
academy video on logarithms.
