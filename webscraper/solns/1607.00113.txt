let $\phi$ be an analytic map taking the unit disk $\mathbb{d}$ into itself.we establish that the class of composition operators $f \mapsto c_\phi(f) = f\circ \phi$ exhibits a rather strong rigidity of non-compact behaviour on thehardy space $h^p$, for $1\le p < \infty$ and $p \neq 2$. our main result is thefollowing trichotomy, which states that exactly one of the followingalternatives holds: (i) $c_\phi$ is a compact operator $h^p \to h^p$, (ii)$c_\phi$ fixes a (linearly isomorphic) copy of $\ell^p$ in $h^p$, but $c_\phi$does not fix any copies of $\ell^2$ in $h^p$, (iii) $c_\phi$ fixes a copy of$\ell^2$ in $h^p$. moreover, in case (iii) the operator $c_\phi$ actually fixesa copy of $l^p(0,1)$ in $h^p$ provided $p > 1$. we reinterpret these results interms of norm-closed ideals of the bounded linear operators on $h^p$, whichcontain the compact operators $\mathcal k(h^p)$. in particular, the class ofcomposition operators on $h^p$ does not reflect the quite complicated latticestructure of such ideals.
