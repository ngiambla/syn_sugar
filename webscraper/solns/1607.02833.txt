this paper investigates the generalization of principal component analysis(pca) to riemannian manifolds. we first propose a new and general type offamily of subspaces in manifolds that we call barycentric subspaces. they areimplicitly defined as the locus of points which are weighted means of $k+1$reference points. as this definition relies on points and not on tangentvectors, it can also be extended to geodesic spaces which are not riemannian.for instance, in stratified spaces, it naturally allows principal subspacesthat span several strata, which is impossible in previous generalizations ofpca. we show that barycentric subspaces locally define a submanifold ofdimension k which generalizes geodesic subspaces.second, we rephrase pca ineuclidean spaces as an optimization on flags of linear subspaces (a hierarchyof properly embedded linear subspaces of increasing dimension). we show thatthe euclidean pca minimizes the accumulated unexplained variances by all thesubspaces of the flag (auv). barycentric subspaces are naturally nested,allowing the construction of hierarchically nested subspaces. optimizing theauv criterion to optimally approximate data points with flags of affine spansin riemannian manifolds lead to a particularly appealing generalization of pcaon manifolds called barycentric subspaces analysis (bsa).
