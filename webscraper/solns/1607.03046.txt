we say that an unordered rooted labeled forest avoids the pattern$\pi\in\mathcal{s}_n$ if the sequence obtained from the labels along the pathfrom the root to any vertex does not contain a subsequence that is in the samerelative order as $\pi$. we enumerate several classes of forests that avoidcertain sets of permutations, including the set of unimodal forests, viabijections with set partitions with certain properties. we also define andinvestigate an analog of wilf-equivalence for forests.
