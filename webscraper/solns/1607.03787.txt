we show how cyclic $(f,\sigma,\delta)$-codes over finite rings canonicallyinduce a $\mathbb{z}$-lattice in $\mathbb{r}^n$ by using certain quotients oforders in nonassociative division algebras defined using the skew polynomial$f$. this construction generalizes the one using certain $\sigma$-constacycliccodes by ducoat and oggier, which used quotients of orders in non-commutativeassociative division algebras defined by $f$, and can be viewed as ageneralization of the classical construction a for lattices from linear codes.it has the potential to be applied to coset coding, in particular to wire-tapcoding. previous results by ducoat and oggier are obtained as special cases.
