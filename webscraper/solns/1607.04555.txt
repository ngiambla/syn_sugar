we prove that a finite family of commuting holomorphic self-maps of the unitball $\mathbb{b}^q\subset \mathbb{c}^q$ admits a simultaneous holomorphicconjugacy to a family of commuting automorphisms of a possibly lowerdimensional ball, and that such conjugacy satisfies a universal property. as anapplication we describe when a hyperbolic and a parabolic holomorphic self-mapof $\mathbb{b}^q$ can commute.
