millimeter-wave (mmwave) mimo with large antenna array has attractedconsiderable interests from academic and industry communities, as it canprovide larger bandwidth and higher spectrum efficiency. however, with hundredsof antennas, the number of radio frequency (rf) chains required by mmwave mimois also huge, leading to unaffordable hardware cost and power consumption inpractice. in this paper, we investigate low rf-complexity technologies to solvethis bottleneck. we first review the evolution of low rf-complexitytechnologies from microwave frequencies to mmwave frequencies. then, we discusstwo promising low rf-complexity technologies for mmwave mimo systems in detail,i.e., phased array based hybrid precoding (pahp) and lens array based hybridprecoding (lahp), including their principles, advantages, challenges, andrecent results. we compare the performance of these two technologies to drawsome insights about how they can be deployed in practice. finally, we concludethis paper and point out some future research directions in this area.
