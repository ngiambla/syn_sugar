we present a proof of rider's unpublished result that the union of two sidonsets in the dual of a non-commutative compact group is sidon, and that randomlysidon sets are sidon. most likely this proof is essentially the one announcedby rider and communicated in a letter to the author around 1979 (lost by himsince then). the key fact is a spectral gap property with respect to certainrepresentations of the unitary groups $u(n)$ that holds uniformly over $n$. theproof crucially uses weyl's character formulae. we survey the results that weobtained 30 years ago using rider's unpublished results. using a recentdifferent approach valid for certain orthonormal systems of matrix valuedfunctions, we give a new proof of the spectral gap property that is required toshow that the union of two sidon sets is sidon. the latter proof yields arather good quantitative estimate. several related results are discussed withpossible applications to random matrix theory.
