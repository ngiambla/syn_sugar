the linear stability of warped product einstein metrics as fixed points ofthe ricci flow is investigated. we generalise the results of gibbons, hartnolland pope and show that in sufficiently low dimensions, all warped producteinstein metrics are unstable. by exploiting the relationship between warpedproduct einstein metrics, quasi-einstein metrics and ricci solitons, weintroduce a new destabilising perturbation (the ricci variation) and show thatcertain infinite families of warped product einstein metrics will be unstablein high dimensions.
