we prove $l^{2}$ estimates and solvability for a variety of simplycharacteristic constant coefficient partial differential equations $p(d)u=f$.these estimates \[||u||_{l^2(d_{r})}\le c\sqrt{d_{r}d_{s}}||f||_{_{l^2(d_{s})}}\] depend on geometric quantities - the diameters $d_{r}$and $d_{s}$ of the regions $d_{r}$, where we estimate $u$, and $d_{s}$, thesupport of $f$ - rather than weights. as these geometric quantities transformsimply under translations, rotations, and dilations, the correspondingestimates share the same properties. in particular, this implies that theytransform appropriately under change of units, and therefore are physicallymeaningful. the explicit dependence on the diameters implies the correct globalgrowth estimates. the weighted $l^{2}$ estimates first proved by agmon in orderto construct the generalized eigenfunctions for laplacian plus potential in$\mathbb{r}^{n}$, and the more general and precise besov type estimates ofagmon and h\"ormander, are all simple direct corollaries of the estimate above.
