standard set-valued young tableaux are a generalization of standard youngtableaux in which cells may contain more than one integer, with the addedconditions that every integer at position $(i,j)$ must be smaller than everyinteger at positions $(i,j+1)$ and $(i+1,j)$. this paper explores thecombinatorics of standard set-valued young tableaux with two-rows, and howthose tableaux may be used to provide new combinatorial interpretations ofgeneralized catalan numbers. new combinatorial interpretations are provided forthe two-parameter fuss-catalan numbers (raney numbers), the rational catalannumbers, and the solution to the so-called "generalized tennis ball problem".methodologies are then introduced for the enumeration of standard set-valuedyoung tableaux, prompting explicit formulas for the general two-row case. thepaper closes by drawing a bijection between arbitrary classes of two-rowstandard set-valued young tableaux and collections of two-dimensional latticepaths that lie weakly below a unique maximal path.
