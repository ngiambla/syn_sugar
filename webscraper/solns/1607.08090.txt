  the model of "open innovations" (oi) can be compared with the "triple helix
of university-industry-government relations" (th) as attempts to find surplus
value in bringing industrial innovation closer to public r&d. whereas the firm
is central in the model of oi, the th adds multi-centeredness: in addition to
firms, universities and (e.g., regional) governments can take leading roles in
innovation eco-systems. in addition to the (transversal) technology transfer at
each moment of time, one can focus on the dynamics in the feedback loops. under
specifiable conditions, feedback loops can be turned into feedforward ones that
drive innovation eco-systems towards self-organization and the auto-catalytic
generation of new options. the generation of options can be more important than
historical realizations ("best practices") for the longer-term viability of
knowledge-based innovation systems. a system without sufficient options, for
example, is locked-in. the generation of redundancy -- the triple helix
indicator -- can be used as a measure of unrealized but technologically
feasible options given a historical configuration. different coordination
mechanisms (markets, policies, knowledge) provide different perspectives on the
same information and thus generate redundancy. increased redundancy not only
stimulates innovation in an eco-system by reducing the prevailing uncertainty;
it also enhances the synergy in and innovativeness of an innovation system.
