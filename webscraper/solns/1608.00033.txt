this paper shows how to construct locally robust semiparametric gmmestimators, meaning equivalently moment conditions have zero derivative withrespect to the first step and the first step does not affect the asymptoticvariance. they are constructed by adding to the moment functions the adjustmentterm for first step estimation. locally robust estimators have severaladvantages. they are vital for valid inference with machine learning in thefirst step, see belloni et. al. (2012, 2014), and are less sensitive to thespecification of the first step. they are doubly robust for affine momentfunctions, so moment conditions continue to hold when one first step componentis incorrect. locally robust moment conditions also have smaller bias that isflatter as a function of first step smoothing leading to improved small sampleproperties. series first step estimators confer local robustness on any momentconditions and are doubly robust for affine moments, in the direction of theseries approximation. many new locally and doubly robust estimators are givenhere, including for economic structural models. we give simple asymptotictheory for estimators that use cross-fitting in the first step, includingmachine learning.
