this paper considers optimization over multiple renewal systems coupled bytime average constraints. these systems act asynchronously over variable lengthframes. for each system, at the beginning of each renewal frame, it chooses anaction which affects the duration of its own frame, the penalty, and theresource expenditure throughout the frame. the goal is to minimize the overalltime average penalty subject to several overall time average resourceconstraints which couple these systems. this problem has applications to taskprocessing networks, coupled markov decision processes(mdps) and so on. wepropose a distributed algorithm so that each system can make its own decisionafter observing a global multiplier which is updated slot-wise. we show thatthis algorithm satisfies the desired constraints and achieves$\mathcal{o}(\varepsilon)$ near optimality with $\mathcal{o}(1/\varepsilon^2)$convergence time.
