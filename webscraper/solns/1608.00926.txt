a depiction of a nonnoetherian integral domain $r$ is a special coordinatering that provides a framework for describing the geometry of $r$. we show thatif $r$ is noetherian in codimension 1, then $r$ has a unique maximal depiction$t$. in this case, the geometric dimensions of the points of$\operatorname{spec}r$ may be computed directly from $t$. if in addition $r$has a normal depiction $s$, then $s$ is the unique maximal depiction of $r$.
