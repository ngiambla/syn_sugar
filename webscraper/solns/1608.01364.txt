we provide general adaptive upper bounds for estimators of nonparametricfunctionals based on second order u-statistics arising from finite dimensionalapproximation of the infinite dimensional models using projection type kernels.an accompanying general adaptive lower bound tool is provided by derivingbounds on chi-square divergence between mixtures of product measures. we thenprovide examples of functionals for which the theory produces rate optimallymatching adaptive upper and lower bound.
