we show that various analogs of hindman's theorem fail in a strong sense whenone attempts to obtain uncountable monochromatic sets:  theorem 1: there exists a colouring $c:\mathbb r\rightarrow\mathbb q$, suchthat for every $x\subseteq\mathbb r$ with $|x|=|\mathbb r|$, and every colour$\gamma\in\mathbb q$, there are two distinct elements $x_0,x_1$ of $x$ forwhich $c(x_0+x_1)=\gamma$. this forms a simultaneous generalization of atheorem of hindman, leader and strauss and a theorem of galvin and shelah.  theorem 2: for every abelian group $g$, there exists a colouring$c:g\rightarrow\mathbb q$ such that for every uncountable $x\subseteq g$, andevery colour $\gamma$, for some large enough integer $n$, there are pairwisedistinct elements $x_0,\ldots,x_n$ of $x$ such that $c(x_0+\cdots+x_n)=\gamma$.in addition, it is consistent that the preceding statement remains valid evenafter enlarging the set of colours from $\mathbb q$ to $\mathbb r$.  theorem 3: let $\circledast_\kappa$ assert that for every abelian group $g$of cardinality $\kappa$, there exists a colouring $c:g\rightarrow g$ such thatfor every positive integer $n$, every $x_0,\ldots,x_n \in[g]^\kappa$, and every$\gamma\in g$, there are $x_0\in x_0,\ldots, x_n\in x_n$ such that$c(x_0+\cdots+x_n)=\gamma$. then $\circledast_\kappa$ holds for unboundedlymany uncountable cardinals $\kappa$, and it is consistent that$\circledast_\kappa$ holds for all regular uncountable cardinals $\kappa$.
