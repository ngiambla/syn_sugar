let $m\ge3$ be an integer. the polygonal numbers of order $m+2$ are given by$p_{m+2}(n)=m\binom n2+n$ $(n=0,1,2,\ldots)$. a famous claim of fermat provedby cauchy asserts that each nonnegative integer is the sum of $m+2$ polygonalnumbers of order $m+2$. for $(a,b)=(1,1),(2,2),(1,3),(2,4)$, we study whetherany sufficiently large integer can be expressed as $$p_{m+2}(x_1) +p_{m+2}(x_2) + ap_{m+2}(x_3) + bp_{m+2}(x_4)$$ with $x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4$nonnegative integers. we show that the answer is positive if$(a,b)\in\{(1,3),(2,4)\}$, or $(a,b)=(1,1)\ \&\ 4\mid m$, or $(a,b)=(2,2)\ \&\m\not\equiv 2\pmod 4$. in particular, we confirm a conjecture of z.-w. sunwhich states that any natural number can be written as $p_6(x_1) + p_6(x_2) +2p_6(x_3) + 4p_6(x_4)$ with $x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4$ nonnegative integers.
