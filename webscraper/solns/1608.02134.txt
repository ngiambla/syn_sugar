we show that in arithmetically-gorenstein line arrangements with only planarsingularities, each line intersects the same number of other lines. this numberhas an algebraic interpretation: it is the castelnuovo-mumford regularity ofthe coordinate ring of the arrangement.  we also prove that every (d-1)-dimensional simplicial complex whose 0-th and1-st homologies are trivial is the nerve complex of a suitable d-dimensionalstandard graded algebra of depth $\ge 3$. this provides the converse of arecent result by katzman, lyubeznik and zhang.
