for $\tau>2$, let $t$ be a $c^\tau$ skew product map of the form$(x+\alpha,y+h(x))$ on $\mathbb t^2$ over a rotation of the circle. we showthat if $t$ preserves a measurable section, then it is disjoint to them\"{o}bius sequence. this in particular implies that any non-uniquely ergodic$c^\tau$ skew product map on $\mathbb t^2$ has a finite index factor that isdisjoint to the m\"{o}bius sequence.
