let $(m,g)$ be an $n-$dimensional complete open riemannian manifold withnonnegative ricci curvature verifying $\rho\delta_g \rho \geq n- 5\geq 0$,where $\delta_g$ is the laplace-beltrami operator on $(m,g)$ and $\rho$ is thedistance function from a given point. if $(m,g)$ supports a second-ordersobolev inequality with a constant $c>0$ close to the optimal constant $k_0$ inthe second-order sobolev inequality in $\mathbb r^n$, we show that a globalvolume non-collapsing property holds on $(m,g)$. the latter property togetherwith a perelman-type construction established by munn (j. geom. anal., 2010)provide several rigidity results in terms of the higher-order homotopy groupsof $(m,g)$. furthermore, it turns out that $(m,g)$ supports the second-ordersobolev inequality with the constant $c=k_0$ if and only if $(m,g)$ isisometric to the euclidean space $\mathbb r^n$.
