it is well-known from the work of kupper and schachermayer that mostlaw-invariant risk measures do not admit a time-consistent representation. inthis work we show that in a brownian filtration the "optimized certaintyequivalent" risk measures of ben-tal and teboulle can be computed through pdetechniques, i.e. dynamically. this can be seen as a substitute of sortswhenever they lack time consistency, and covers the cases of conditionalvalue-at-risk and monotone mean-variance. our method consists of focusing onthe convex dual representation, which suggests extending the state space. withthis we can obtain a dynamic programming principle and use stochastic controltechniques, along with the theory of viscosity solutions, which we must adaptto cover the present singular situation.
