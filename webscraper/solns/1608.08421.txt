we provide mutual elementary recursive order isomorphisms between classicalordinal notations, based on skolem hulling, and notations from pure elementarypatterns of resemblance of order $2$, showing that the latter characterize theproof-theoretic ordinal of the fragment $\pi^1_1$-$\mathrm{ca}_0$ of secondorder number theory, or equivalently the set theory $\mathrm{kpl}_0$. as acorollary, we prove that carlson's result on the well-quasi orderedness ofrespecting forests of order $2$ implies transfinite induction up to the ordinalof $\mathrm{kpl}_0$. we expect that our approach will facilitate analysis ofmore powerful systems of patterns.
