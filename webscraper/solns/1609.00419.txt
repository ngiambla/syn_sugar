we study optimal geographic content placement for device-to-device (d2d)networks in which each file's popularity follows the zipf distribution. thelocations of the d2d users (caches) are modeled by a poisson point process(ppp) and have limited communication range and finite storage. inspired by themat\'{e}rn hard-core (type ii) point process that captures pairwiseinteractions between nodes, we devise a novel spatially correlated cachingstrategy called {\em hard-core placement} (hcp) such that the d2d nodes cachingthe same file are never closer to each other than the {\em exclusion radius}.the exclusion radius plays the role of a substitute for caching probability. wederive and optimize the exclusion radii to maximize the {\em hit probability},which is the probability that a given d2d node can find a desired file atanother node's cache within its communication range. contrasting it withindependent content placement, which is used in most prior work, our hcpstrategy often yields a significantly higher cache hit probability. we furtherdemonstrate that the hcp strategy is effective for small cache sizes and asmall communication radius, which are likely conditions for d2d.
