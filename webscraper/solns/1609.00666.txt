a multiple integral representation of single and joint moments of the totalmass of the limit log-infinitely divisible stochastic measure of bacry and muzy[$\textit{comm. math. phys.}$ ${\bf 236}$: 449-475, 2003] is derived. thecovariance structure of the total mass of the measure is shown to belogarithmic. a generalization of the selberg integral corresponding to singlemoments of the limit measure is proposed and shown to satisfy a recurrencerelation. the joint moments of the limit lognormal measure, classical selbergintegral with $\lambda_1=\lambda_2=0,$ and morris integral are represented inthe form of multiple binomial sums. for application, low moments of the limitlog-poisson measure are computed exactly and low joint moments of the limitlognormal measure are considered in detail.
