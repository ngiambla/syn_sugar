in this article, we study critical points (zeros of derivative) of randompolynomials. take two deterministic sequences $\{a_n\}_{n\geq1}$ and$\{b_n\}_{n\geq1}$ of complex numbers whose limiting empirical measures aresame. by choosing $\xi_n = a_n$ or $b_n$ with equal probability, define thesequence of polynomials by $p_n(z)=(z-\xi_1)\dots(z-\xi_n)$. we show that thelimiting measure of zeros and critical points agree for this sequence of randompolynomials under some assumption. we also prove a similar result fortriangular array of numbers. a similar result for zeros of generalizedderivative (can be thought as random rational function) is also proved.pemantle and rivin initiated the study of critical points of randompolynomials. kabluchko proved the result considering the zeros to be i.i.d.random variables.
