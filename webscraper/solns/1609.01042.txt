diestel and leader have characterised connected graphs that admit a normalspanning tree via two classes of forbidden minors. one class are halin's$(\aleph_0,\aleph_1)$-graphs: bipartite graphs with bipartition$(\mathbb{n},b)$ such that $b$ is uncountable and every vertex of $b$ hasinfinite degree.  our main result is that under martin's axiom and the failure of the continuumhypothesis, the class of forbidden $(\aleph_0,\aleph_1)$-graphs in diestel andleader's result can be replaced by one single instance of such a graph.  under ch, however, the class of $(\aleph_0,\aleph_1)$-graphs containsminor-incomparable elements, namely graphs of binary type, and$\mathcal{u}$-indivisible graphs. assuming ch, diestel and leader asked whetherevery $(\aleph_0,\aleph_1)$-graph has an $(\aleph_0,\aleph_1)$-minor that iseither indivisible or of binary type, and whether any two$\mathcal{u}$-indivisible graphs are necessarily minors of each other. for bothquestions, we construct examples showing that the answer is in the negative.
