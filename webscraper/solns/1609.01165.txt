suppose that a mobile sensor describes a markovian trajectory in the ambientspace. at each time the sensor measures an attribute of interest, e.g., thetemperature. using only the location history of the sensor and the associatedmeasurements, the aim is to estimate the average value of the attribute overthe space. in contrast to classical probabilistic integration methods, e.g.,monte carlo, the proposed approach does not require any knowledge on thedistribution of the sensor trajectory. probabilistic bounds on the convergencerates of the estimator are established. these rates are better than thetraditional "root n"-rate, where n is the sample size, attached to otherprobabilistic integration methods. for finite sample sizes, the good behaviourof the procedure is demonstrated through simulations and an application to theevaluation of the average temperature of oceans is considered.
