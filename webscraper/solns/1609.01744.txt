we prove that, for a good meromorphic flat bundle with poles along a divisorwith normal crossings, the restriction of the irregularity complex to eachnatural stratum of this divisor only depends on the formal flat bundle alongthis stratum. this answers a question raised by j.-b. teyssier. this versiontakes into account the published erratum.
