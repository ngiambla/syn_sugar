we derive the formula of the entanglement entropy between the left and rightoscillating modes of the $\sigma$-model with the de sitter target space. tothis end, we study the theory in the \emph{cosmological gauge} in which thenon-vanishing components of the metric on the two-dimensional base space arefunctions of the expansion parameter of the de sitter space. the model isembedded in the causal north pole diamond of the penrose diagram. we argue thatthe cosmological gauge is natural to the $\sigma$-model as it is compatiblewith the canonical quantization relations. in this gauge, we obtain a newgeneral solution to the equations of motion in terms of time-independentoscillating modes. the constraint structure is adequate for quantization in thegupta-bleuler formalism. we construct the space of states as a one-parameterfamily of hilbert spaces and give the bargmann-fock and jordan-schwingerrepresentations of it. also, we give a simple description of the physicalsubspace as an infinite product of $\mathcal{d}^{+}_{\frac{1}{2}}$ in thepositive discreet series irreducible representations of the $su(1,1)$ group. weconstruct the map generated by the hamiltonian between states at two differentvalues of time and show how it produces the entanglement of left and rightexcitations. next, we derive the formula of the entanglement entropy of thereduced density matrix for the ground state acted upon by the hamiltonian map.finally, we determine the asymptotic form of the entanglement entropy of asingle mode bi-oscillator in the limit of large values of time.
