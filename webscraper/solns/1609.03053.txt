we present a novel framework for finite element particle-in-cell methodsbased on the discretization of the underlying hamiltonian structure of thevlasov-maxwell system. we derive a semi-discrete poisson bracket, which retainsthe defining properties of a bracket, anti-symmetry and the jacobi identity, aswell as conservation of its casimir invariants, implying that the semi-discretesystem is still a hamiltonian system. in order to obtain a fully discretepoisson integrator, the semi-discrete bracket is used in conjunction withhamiltonian splitting methods for integration in time. techniques from finiteelement exterior calculus ensure conservation of the divergence of the magneticfield and gauss' law as well as stability of the field solver. the resultingmethods are gauge invariant, feature exact charge conservation and showexcellent long-time energy and momentum behaviour. due to the generality of ourframework, these conservation properties are guaranteed independently of aparticular choice of the finite element basis, as long as the correspondingfinite element spaces satisfy certain compatibility conditions.
