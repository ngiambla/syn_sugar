dedekind sums are arithmetic sums that were first introduced by dedekind inthe context of elliptic functions and modular forms, and later recognized to besurprisingly ubiquitous. among the variations and generalizations introducedsince, there is a construction of dedekind sums for lattices in$\mathrm{sl}_2(\mathbf{r}). building upon work of asai, we prove thereciprocity law for these dedekind sums, based on a concrete realization of theeuler class. as an application, we obtain an explicit formula expressingdedekind sums for hecke triangle groups in terms of continued fractions.
