in the paper, we make use of manton's analytical method to investigate theforce between kink and the anti-kink with large distance in $1+1$ dimensionalfield theory. the related potential has infinite order corrections ofexponential pattern, and coefficients for each order are determined. thesecoefficients can also be obtained by solving the equation of the fluctuationaround the vacuum. at the lowest order, the kink lattice represents the todalattice. with higher order correction terms, the kink lattice can represent onekind of the generic toda lattice. with only two sites, the kink lattice isclassically integrable. if the number of sites of the lattice is larger thantwo, the kink lattice is not integrable but a near integrable system. we takeuse of the flaschka's variables to study the lax pair of the kink lattice.these flaschka's variables have interesting algebraic relations and thenon-integrability can be manifested. we also discussed the higher hamiltoniansfor the deformed open toda lattice, which has a similar result as the ordinarydeformed toda.
