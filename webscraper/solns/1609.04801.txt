we present a quite efficient method to compute the roots of bernstein-satopolynomial of a homogeneous polynomial if the associated projectivehypersurface has only weighted homogeneous isolated singularities (so that itslocal bernstein-sato polynomials are uniquely determined by weights) and if acertain condition is satisfied. in the three variable case, the last conditionholds except for polynomials of quite special type (that is, extremelydegenerated ones) as far as calculated. the computation of roots is reduced tothat of the hilbert series of graded milnor algebras, which can be doneinstantly by computers (unless the degree is huge), although it takes muchlonger to get the bernstein-sato polynomial itself (that is, withmultiplicities) using a computer program in general. for the proof of theformula, we prove the $e_2$-degeneration of the pole order spectral sequence.we have a simpler formula for the roots of bernstein-sato polynomials if theprojective hypersurfaces have only ordinary double points or the tjurina numberis relatively small.
