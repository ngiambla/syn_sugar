we give a construction of r-partite r-uniform intersecting hypergraphs withcover number at least r-4 for all but finitely many r. this answers a questionof abu-khazneh, barat, pokrovskiy and szabo, and shows that a long-standingunsolved conjecture due to ryser is close to being best possible for everyvalue of r.
