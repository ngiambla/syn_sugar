classical orthogonal polynomial systems of jacobi, hermite, laguerre andbessel have the property that the polynomials of each system are eigenfunctionsof a second order ordinary differential operator. according to a classicaltheorem by bochner they are the only systems with this property. similarly, thepolynomials of charlier, meixner, kravchuk and hahn are both orthogonal and areeigenfunctions of a suitable difference operator of second order. we recallthat according to the famous theorem of favard-shohat, the condition oforthogonality is equivalent to the 3-term recurrence relation. vectororthogonal polynomials (vop) satisfy finite-term recurrence relation with moreterms, according to a theorem by j. van iseghem and this characterizes them.  motivated by bochner's theorem we are looking for vop that are alsoeigenfunctions of a differential (difference) operator. we call thesesimultaneous conditions bochner's property.  the goal of this paper is to introduce methods for construction of vop whichhave bochner's property. the methods are purely algebraic and are based onautomorphisms of non-commutative algebras. they also use ideas from the socalled bispectral problem. applications of the abstract methods include broadgeneralizations of the classical orthogonal polynomials, both continuous anddiscrete. other results connect different families of vop, including theclassical ones, by linear transforms of purely algebraic origin, despite of thefact that, when interpreted analytically, they are integral transformations.
