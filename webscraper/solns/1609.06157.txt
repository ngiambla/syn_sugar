classical orthogonal polynomial systems of jacobi, hermite and laguerre havethe property that the polynomials of each system are eigenfunctions of a secondorder ordinary differential operator. according to a famous theorem by bochnerthey are the only systems on the real line with this property. similarly, thediscrete orthogonal polynomials of charlier, meixner, kravchuk and hahn areeigenfunctions of a second order difference operator of order $2$. in a recentpaper \cite{ho3} we introduced a natural class of polynomial systems whosemembers are the eigenfunctions of a linear differential operator of any orderand which satisfy a linear recurrence relation of some finite length. (by atheorem of maroni, the latter condition amounts to vector orthogonality.)additionally, we found classes of such systems for which a linear differentialoperator is substituted by a linear difference operator. the polynomialsystems, presented in \cite{ho3} enjoy a number of properties which make them anatural analog of the classical orthogonal polynomials. some of the propertieswere pointed out in \cite{ho3}.  in the present paper we continue their study. among the most important newproperties, we find their hypergeometric representations which allow us toderive their generating functions and in some cases also mehler-heine typeformulas. this even more emphasizes their similarity to the classicalorthogonal polynomials.
