this paper investigates the analytic properties of the liouville function'sdirichlet series that obtains from the function f(s)= zeta(2s)/zeta(s), where sis a complex variable and zeta(s) is the riemann zeta function. the paperemploys a novel method of summing the series by casting it as an infinitenumber of sums over sub-series that exhibit a certain symmetry and rapidconvergence. in this procedure, which heavily invokes the prime factorizationtheorem, each sub-series has the property that it oscillates in a predictablefashion, rendering the analytic properties of the dirichlet seriesdeterminable. with this method, the paper demonstrates that, for every integerwith an even number of primes in its factorization, there is another integerthat has an odd number of primes (multiplicity counted) in its factorization.furthermore, by showing that a sufficient condition derived by littlewood(1912) is satisfied, the paper demonstrates that the function f(s) is analyticover the two half-planes re(s) > 1/2 and re(s)<1/2. this establishes that thenontrivial zeros of the riemann zeta function can only occur on the criticalline re(s)=1/2.
