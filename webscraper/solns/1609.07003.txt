the notion of fractional monodromy was introduced by nekhoroshev,sadovski\'{i} and zhilinski\'{i} as a generalization of standard (`integer')monodromy in the sense of duistermaat from torus bundles to singular torusfibrations. in the present paper we prove a general result that allows tocompute fractional monodromy in various integrable hamiltonian systems. inparticular, we show that the non-triviality of fractional monodromy in 2degrees of freedom systems with a hamiltonian circle action is related only tothe fixed points of the circle action. our approach is based on the study of aspecific notion of parallel transport along seifert manifolds.
