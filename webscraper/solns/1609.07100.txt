let $p$ and $q$ be anisotropic quadratic forms over a field $f$ ofcharacteristic $\neq 2$, let $s$ be the unique non-negative integer such that$2^s < \mathrm{dim}(p) \leq 2^{s+1}$, and let $k$ denote the dimension of theanisotropic part of $q$ after scalar extension to the function field $f(p)$ of$p$. we conjecture that $\mathrm{dim}(q)$ must lie within $k$ of a multiple of$2^{s+1}$. this can be viewed as a direct generalization of hoffmann'sseparation theorem. among other cases, we prove that the conjecture is true if$k<2^{s-1}$. when $k=0$, this shows that any anisotropic form representing anelement of the kernel of the natural restriction homomorphism $w(f)\rightarroww(f(p))$ has dimension divisible by $2^{s+1}$.
