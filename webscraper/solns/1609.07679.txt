let $\zeta = \xi + i\xi'$ where $\xi, \xi'$ are iid copies of a mean zero,variance one, subgaussian random variable. let $n_n$ be a $n \times n$ randommatrix with entries that are iid copies of $\zeta$. we prove that there existsa $c \in (0,1)$ such that the probability that $n_n$ has any real eigenvaluesis less than $c^n$ where $c$ only depends on the subgaussian moment of $\xi$.the bound is optimal up to the value of the constant $c$. the principalcomponent of the proof is an optimal tail bound on the least singular value ofmatrices of the form $m_n := m + n_n$ where $m$ is a deterministic complexmatrix with the condition that $\|m\| \leq k n^{1/2}$ for some constant $k$depending on the subgaussian moment of $\xi$. for this class of randomvariables, this result improves on the results of pan-zhou andrudelson-vershynin. in the proof of the tail bound, we develop an optimalsmall-ball probability bound for complex random variables that generalizes thelittlewood-offord theory developed by tao-vu and rudelson-vershynin.
