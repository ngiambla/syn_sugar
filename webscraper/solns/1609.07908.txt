containment problems for polytopes and spectrahedra appear in variousapplications, such as linear and semidefinite programming, combinatorics,convexity and stability analysis of differential equations. this paper exploresthe theoretical background of a method proposed by ben-tal and nemirovksi.their method provides a strengthening of the containment problem, that isalgorithmically well tractable. to analyze this method, we study abstractoperator systems, and investigate when they have a finite-dimensional concreterealization. our results give some profound insight into their approach. theyimply that when testing the inclusion of a fixed polyhedral cone in anarbitrary spectrahedron, the strengthening is tight if and only if thepolyhedral cone is a simplex. this is true independent of the representation ofthe polytope. we also deduce error bounds in the other cases, simplifying andextending recent results by various authors.
