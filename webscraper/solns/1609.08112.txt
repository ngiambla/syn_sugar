noetherian dimer algebras form a prominent class of examples ofnoncommutative crepant resolutions (nccrs). however, dimer algebras which arenoetherian are quite rare, and we consider the question: how close arenonnoetherian homotopy dimer algebras to being nccrs? to address this question,we introduce a generalization of nccrs to nonnoetherian tiled matrix rings. weshow that if a noetherian dimer algebra is obtained from a nonnoetherianhomotopy dimer algebra $a$ by contracting each arrow whose head has indegree 1,then $a$ is a noncommutative desingularization of its nonnoetherian center.furthermore, if any two arrows whose tails have indegree 1 are coprime, then$a$ is a nonnoetherian nccr.
