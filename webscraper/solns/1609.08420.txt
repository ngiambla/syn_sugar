abhyankar proved that every field of finite transcendence degree over$\mathbb{q}$ or over a finite field is a homomorphic image of a subring of thering of polynomials $\mathbb{z}[t_1, \dots, t_n]$ (for some $n$ depending onthe field). we conjecture that his result can not be substantially strengthenedand show that our conjecture implies a well-known conjecture on the additiveidempotence of semifields that are finitely generated as semirings.
