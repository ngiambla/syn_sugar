performance guarantees for compression in nonlinear models under non-gaussianobservations can be achieved through the use of distributional characteristicsthat are sensitive to the distance to normality, and which in particular returnthe value of zero under gaussian or linear sensing. the use of thesecharacteristics, or discrepancies, improves some previous results in this areaby relaxing conditions and tightening performance bounds. in addition, thesecharacteristics are tractable to compute when gaussian sensing is corrupted byeither additive errors or mixing.
