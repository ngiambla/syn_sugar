the classical bi-lipschitz and quasisymmetric schoenflies theorems in theplane by tukia, beurling and ahlfors are generalized in this paper for allplanar uniform domains. specifically, we show that if $u\subset \mathbb{r}^2$is a uniform domain then it has the following two extension properties: (1)every bi-lipschitz map $f:\partial u \to \mathbb{r}^2$ that can be extendedhomeomorphically to $\mathbb{r}^2$ can also be extended bi-lipschitz to$\mathbb{r}^2$ and (2) if $\partial u$ is relatively connected then everyquasisymmetric map $f:\partial u \to \mathbb{r}^2$ that can be extendedhomeomorphically to $\mathbb{r}^2$ can also be extended quasisymmetrically to$\mathbb{r}^2$. in higher dimensions, we show that if $u$ is the exterior of auniformly disconnected set in $\mathbb{r}^n$ then every bi-lipschitz embedding$f:\partial u \to \mathbb{r}^n$ extends to a bi-lipschitz homeomorphism of$\mathbb{r}^n$. the same is also true for quasisymmetric embeddings under theadditional assumption that $\partial u$ is relatively connected.
