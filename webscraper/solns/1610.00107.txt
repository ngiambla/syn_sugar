the connective constant $\mu(g)$ of a graph $g$ is the exponential growthrate of the number of self-avoiding walks starting at a given vertex. weinvestigate the validity of the inequality $\mu \ge \phi$ for infinite,transitive, simple, cubic graphs, where $\phi:= \frac12(1+\sqrt 5)$ is thegolden mean. the inequality is proved for several families of graphs including(i) cayley graphs of infinite groups with three generators and strictlypositive first betti number, (ii) infinite, transitive, topologically locallyfinite (tlf) planar, cubic graphs, and (iii) cubic cayley graphs with two ends.bounds for $\mu$ are presented for transitive cubic graphs with girth either$3$ or $4$, and for certain quasi-transitive cubic graphs.
