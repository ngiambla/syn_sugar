we show that the well-partial orderedness of the finite downwards closedsubsets of $\mathbb{n}^k$ ,ordered by inclusion, is equivalent to thewell-foundedness of the ordinal $\omega^{\omega^\omega}$. this was conjecturedto be the case by hatzikiriakou and simpson. since we use friedman's adjacentramsey theorem for fixed dimensions in the upper bound, we also give atreatment of the reverse mathematical status of that theorem.
