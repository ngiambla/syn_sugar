we continue our study of the mckay correspondence for grading preservingactions of semisimple hopf algebras h on (noncommutative) artin-schelterregular algebras a. here, we establish correspondences between modulecategories over a^h, over a\#h, and over \end_{a^h} a. we also studyhomological properties of (endomorphism rings of) maximal cohen-macaulaymodules over a^h.
