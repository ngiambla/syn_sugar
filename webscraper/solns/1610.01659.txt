infinite dimensional moment problems have a long history in diverse appliedareas dealing with the analysis of complex systems but progress is hindered bythe lack of a general understanding of the mathematical structure behind them.therefore, such problems have recently got great attention in real algebraicgeometry also because of their deep connection to the finite dimensional case.in particular, our most recent collaboration with murray marshall and mehdighasemi about the infinite dimensional moment problem on symmetric algebras oflocally convex spaces revealed intriguing questions and relations between realalgebraic geometry, functional and harmonic analysis. motivated by thispromising interaction, the principal goal of this paper is to identify the maincurrent challenges in the theory of the infinite dimensional moment problem andto highlight their impact in applied areas. the last advances achieved in thisemerging field and briefly reviewed throughout this paper led us to severalopen questions which we outline here.
