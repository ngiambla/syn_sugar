the lopsided lov\'asz local lemma (llll) is a probabilistic tool which is acornerstone of the probabilistic method of combinatorics, which shows that itis possible to avoid a collection of "bad" events as long as theirprobabilities and interdependencies are sufficiently small. the strongestpossible criterion that can be stated in these terms is due to shearer (1985),although it is technically difficult to apply to constructions incombinatorics.  the original formulation of the llll was non-constructive, a seminalalgorithm of moser & tardos (2010) gave an efficient constructive algorithm fornearly all applications of it, including applications to $k$-sat instances witha bounded number of occurrences per variables. harris (2015) later gave analternate criterion for this algorithm to converge, which appeared to givestronger bounds than the standard lll. unlike the lll criterion or itsvariants, this criterion depends in a fundamental way on the decomposition ofbad-events into variables.  in this note, we show that the criterion given by harris can be stronger insome cases even than shearer's criterion. we construct $k$-sat formulas withbounded variable occurrence, and show that the criterion of harris is satisfiedwhile the criterion of shearer is violated. in fact, there is an exponentiallygrowing gap between the bounds provable from any form of the llll and from thebound shown by harris.
