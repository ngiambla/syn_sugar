this paper proposes energy-efficient coordinated beamforming strategies formulti-cell multi-user multiple-input single-output system. we consider apractical power consumption model, where part of the consumed power depends onthe base station or user specific data rates due to coding, decoding andbackhaul. this is different from the existing approaches where the base stationpower consumption has been assumed to be a convex or linear function of thetransmit powers. two optimization criteria are considered, namely networkenergy efficiency maximization and weighted sum energy efficiency maximization.we develop successive convex approximation based algorithms to tackle thesedifficult nonconvex problems. we further propose decentralized implementationsfor the considered problems, in which base stations perform parallel anddistributed computation based on local channel state information and limitedbackhaul information exchange. the decentralized approaches admit closed-formsolutions and can be implemented without invoking a generic external convexsolver. we also show an example of the pilot contamination effect on the energyefficiency using a heuristic pilot allocation strategy. the numerical resultsare provided to demonstrate that the rate dependent power consumption has alarge impact on the system energy efficiency, and, thus, has to be taken intoaccount when devising energy-efficient transmission strategies. the significantgains of the proposed algorithms over the conventional low-complexitybeamforming algorithms are also illustrated.
