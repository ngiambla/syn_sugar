in this paper we consider the problem of identifying a connection $\nabla$ ona vector bundle up to gauge equivalence from the dirichlet-to-neumann map ofthe connection laplacian $\nabla^*\nabla$ over conformally transversallyanisotropic (cta) manifolds. this was proved in \cite{lcw} for line bundles inthe case of the transversal manifold being simple -- we generalise this resultto the case where the transversal manifold only has an injective ray transform.moreover, the construction of suitable gaussian beam solutions on vectorbundles is given for the case of the connection laplacian and a potential,following the works of \cite{cta}. this in turn enables us to construct thecomplex geometrical optics (cgo) solutions and prove our main uniquenessresult. we also reduce the problem to a new non-abelian x-ray transform for thecase of simple transversal manifolds and higher rank vector bundles. finally,we prove the recovery of a flat connection in general from the dn map, up togauge equivalence, using an argument relating the cauchy data of the connectionlaplacian and the holonomy.
