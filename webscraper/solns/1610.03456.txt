let $c$ be a petri general curve of genus $g$ and $e$ a general stable vectorbundle of rank $r$ and slope $g-1$ over $c$ with $h^0 (c, e) = r+1$. for $g >(2r+2)(2r+1)$, we show how the bundle $e$ can be recovered from the tangentcone to the theta divisor $\theta_e$ at ${\mathcal o}_c$. we use this to give aconstructive proof and a sharpening of brivio and verra's theorem that thetheta map $su_c (r) -rightarrow |r \theta|$ is generically injective for largevalues of $g$.
