in this paper we prove that, for any arithmetic hyperbolic $n$-manifold $m$of the first type, the systole of most of the principal congruence coverings$m_{i}$ satisfy $$sys_{1}(m_{i})\geq \frac{8}{n(n+1)}\log(vol(m_{i}))-c,$$where $c$ is a constant independent of $i$. this generalizes previous work ofbuser and sarnak, and katz, schaps and vishne in dimension 2 and 3. asapplications, we obtain explicit estimates for systolic genus of hyperbolicmanifolds studied by belolipetsky and the distance of homological codesconstructed by guth and lubotzky. in an appendix together with cayo d\'oria weprove that the constant $\frac{8}{n(n+1)}$ is sharp.
