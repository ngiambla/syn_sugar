regular model sets generated from a cut-and-project scheme given by aco-compact lattice $\mathcal l\subset g\times h$ and compact and aperiodicwindow $w\subseteq h$, have the maximal equicontinuous factor (mef) $(g\timesh)/\mathcal l$, if the window is toplogically regular. this picture breaks downcompletely, when the window has empty interior, in which case the mef is alwaystrivial, although $(g\times h)/\mathcal l$ continues to be the kronecker factorfor the mirsky measure. as this situation occurs for many interesting exampleslike the square-free numbers or the visible lattice points, there is some needfor a slightly weaker concept of topological factors that is still strongenough to capture basic properties of the system. here we propose to use theconcept of a generic factor [huang, ye (2012)] for this purpose. for so calledergodic topological dynamical systems we prove the existence of a maximalequicontinuous generic factor (megf) and characterize it in terms of theregional proximal relation. for such systems we also show that the megf istrivial if and only if the system is topologically weakly mixing. this part ofthe paper profits strongly from previous work by mcmahon (1978) and auslander(1988). in the second part we show that $(g\times h)/\mathcal l$ is indeed themegf of each weak model.
