we develop a general framework for producing uncountable families of exoticactions of certain classically studied groups acting on the circle. we showthat if $l$ is a nontrivial limit group then the nonlinear representationvariety $\mathrm{hom}(l,\mathrm{homeo}_+(s^1))$ contains uncountably manysemi-conjugacy classes of faithful actions on $s^1$ with pairwise disjointrotation spectra (except for $0$) such that each representation lifts to$\mathbb{r}$. for the case of most fuchsian groups $l$, we prove further thatthis flexibility phenomenon occurs even locally, thus complementing a result ofk. mann. we prove that each non-elementary free or surface group admits anaction on $s^1$ that is never semi-conjugate to any action that factors througha finite--dimensional connected lie subgroup in $\mathrm{homeo}_+(s^1)$. it isexhibited that the mapping class groups of bounded surfaces havenon-semi-conjugate faithful actions on $s^1$. in the process of establishingthese results, we prove general combination theorems for indiscrete subgroupsof $\mathrm{psl}_2(\mathbb{r})$ which apply to most fuchsian groups and to alllimit groups. we also show topological baumslag lemma, and general combinationtheorems for representations into baire topological groups. the abundance of$\mathbb{z}$--valued subadditive defect--one quasimorphisms on these groupswould follow as a corollary. we also give a mostly self-containedreconciliation of the various notions of semi-conjugacy in the extantliterature by showing that they are all equivalent.
