take a finite system of l\'evy particles on the real line. each particlemoves as a l\'evy process according to its current rank relative to otherparticles. we find a natural sufficient condition for convergence to astationary distribution, which guarantees all particles move together, asopposed to eventually splitting into two or more groups. this extends theresearch of (banner, fernholz, karatzas, 2005) to systems without jumps(brownian particles).
