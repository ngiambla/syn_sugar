we introduce thagomizer matroids and compute the kazhdan-lusztig polynomialof a rank $n+1$ thagomizer matroid by showing that the coefficient of $t^k$ isequal to the number of dyck paths of semilength $n$ with $k$ long ascents. wealso give a conjecture for the $s_n$-equivariant kazhdan-lusztig polynomial ofa thagomizer matroid.
