we study the problem of dynamic assortment personalization with large,heterogeneous populations and wide arrays of products, and demonstrate theimportance of structural priors for effective, efficient large-scalepersonalization. assortment personalization is the problem of choosing, foreach individual or consumer segment (type), a best assortment of products, ads,or other offerings (items) so as to maximize revenue. this problem is centralto revenue management in e-commerce, online advertising, and multi-locationbrick-and-mortar retail, where both items and types can number in the millions.  we formulate the dynamic assortment personalization problem as adiscrete-contextual bandit with $m$ contexts (customer types) and exponentiallymany arms (assortments of the $n$ items). we assume that each type'spreferences follow a simple parametric model with $n$ parameters. in all, thereare $mn$ parameters, and existing literature suggests that order optimal regretscales as $mn$. however, the data required to estimate so many parameters isorders of magnitude larger than the data available in most revenue managementapplications; and the optimal regret under these models is unacceptably high.  in this paper, we impose a natural structure on the problem -- a small latentdimension, or low rank. in the static setting, we show that this model can beefficiently learned from surprisingly few interactions, using a time- andmemory-efficient optimization algorithm that converges globally whenever themodel is learnable. in the dynamic setting, we show that structure-awaredynamic assortment personalization can have regret that is an order ofmagnitude smaller than structure-ignorant approaches. we validate ourtheoretical results empirically.
