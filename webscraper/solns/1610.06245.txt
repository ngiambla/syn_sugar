we give explicit necessary and sufficient conditions for the abstractcommensurability of certain families of 1-ended, hyperbolic groups, namelyright-angled coxeter groups defined by generalized theta-graphs and cycles ofgeneralized theta-graphs, and geometric amalgams of free groups whose jsjgraphs are trees of diameter at most 4. we also show that if a geometricamalgam of free groups has jsj graph a tree, then it is commensurable to aright-angled coxeter group, and give an example of a geometric amalgam of freegroups which is not quasi-isometric (hence not commensurable) to any groupwhich is finitely generated by torsion elements. our proofs involve a newgeometric realization of the right-angled coxeter groups we consider, such thatcovers corresponding to torsion-free, finite-index subgroups are surfaceamalgams.
