we study survival among two competing types in two settings: a planar growthmodel related to two-neighbour bootstrap percolation, and a system of urns withgraph-based interactions. in the planar growth model, uncoloured sites aregiven a colour at rate $0$, $1$ or $\infty$, depending on whether they havezero, one, or at least two neighbours of that colour. in the urn scheme, eachvertex of a graph $g$ has an associated urn containing some number of eitherblue or red balls (but not both). at each time step, a ball is chosen uniformlyat random from all those currently present in the system, a ball of the samecolour is added to each neighbouring urn, and balls in the same urn but ofdifferent colours annihilate on a one-for-one basis. we show that, for everyconnected graph $g$ and every initial configuration, only one colour survivesalmost surely. as a corollary, we deduce that in the two-type growth model on$\mathbb{z}^2$, one of the colours only infects a finite number of sites withprobability one. we also discuss generalisations to higher dimensions andmulti-type processes, and list a number of open problems and conjectures.
