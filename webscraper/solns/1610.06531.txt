we obtain representations of $x_1$ exceptional orthogonal polynomials throughdeterminants of matrices that have certain adjusted moments as entries. westart out directly from the darboux transformation, allowing for a universalperspective, rather than dependent upon the particular system (jacobi or typeof laguerre polynomials). we include a recursion formula for the adjustedmoments and provide the initial adjusted moments for each system.  throughout we relate to the various examples of $x_1$ exceptional orthogonalpolynomials. we especially focus on and provide complete proofs for the jacobiand the type iii laguerre case, as they are less prevalent in literature.  lastly, we include a preliminary discussion explaining that the higherco-dimension setting becomes more involved. the number of possibilities andchoices is exemplified, but only starts, with the lack of a canonical flag.
