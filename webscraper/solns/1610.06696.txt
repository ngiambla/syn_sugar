let $g$ be a totally disconnected, locally compact group and let $h$ be anequicontinuously (for example, compactly) generated group of automorphisms of$g$. we show that every distal action of $h$ on a coset space of $g$ is a sinaction, with the small invariant neighbourhoods arising from open $h$-invariantsubgroups. we obtain a number of consequences for the structure of thecollection of open subgroups. for example, it follows that for every compactlygenerated subgroup $k$ of $g$, there is a compactly generated open subgroup $e$of $g$ such that $k \le e$ and such that every open subgroup of $g$ containinga finite index subgroup of $k$ contains a finite index subgroup of $e$. we alsoshow that for a large class of closed subgroups $l$ of $g$ (including forinstance all closed subgroups $l$ such that $l$ is an intersection of subnormalsubgroups of open subgroups), every compactly generated open subgroup of $l$can be realized as $l \cap o$ for an open subgroup of $g$.
