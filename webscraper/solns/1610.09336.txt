we introduce the notion of differential torsors, which allows the adaptationof constructions from algebraic geometry to differential galois theory. usingthese differential torsors, we set up a general framework for applying patchingtechniques in differential galois theory over fields of characteristic zero. weshow that patching holds over function fields over the complex numbers. as themain application, we prove the solvability of all differential embeddingproblems over complex function fields, thereby providing new insight on thestructure of the absolute differential galois group, i.e., the fundamentalgroup of the underlying tannakian category.
