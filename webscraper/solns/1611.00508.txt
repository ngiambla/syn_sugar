we prove the {\it coexistence} of stable and unstable quasi--periodic {\rmkam} tori in a region of phase space of the three-body problem. the proof goesalong the production of two non smoothly related systems of canonicalcoordinates in the same region of the phase space, the possibility of which isforeseen, for "properly--degenerate" systems, by a theorem of nekhorossev andmi\v{s}{\v{c}}enko and fomenko. the two coordinate systems are alternative tothe classical reduction of the nodes by jacobi, described, e.g., inref.\cite[iii,\s 5, n. 4, p. 141]{arnold63}.
