in our previous work we introduced, for a riemannian surface $s$, thequantity $ \lambda(s):=\inf_f\lambda_0(f)$, where $\lambda_0(f)$ denotes thefirst dirichlet eigenvalue of $f$ and the infimum is taken over all compactsubsurfaces $f$ of $s$ with smooth boundary and abelian fundamental group. aresult of brooks implies $\lambda(s)\ge\lambda_0(\tilde{s})$, the bottom of thespectrum of the universal cover $\tilde{s}$. in this paper, we discuss thestrictness of the inequality. moreover, in the case of curvature bounds, werelate $\lambda(s)$ with the systole, improving a result by the last namedauthor.
