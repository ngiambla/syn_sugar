we prove that if $\gamma$ is an icc irreducible lattice in a product ofconnected non-compact rank one simple lie groups with finite center, then theii$_1$ factor $l(\gamma)$ is prime. in particular, we deduce that the ii$_1$factors associated to the arithmetic groups $\text{psl}_2(\mathbb z[\sqrt{d}])$and $\text{psl}_2(\mathbb z[s^{-1}])$ are prime, for any square-free integer$d\geq 2$ with $d\not\equiv 1 mod{4}$ and any finite non-empty set of primes$s$. this provides the first examples of prime ii$_1$ factors arising fromlattices in higher rank semisimple lie groups. more generally, we describe alltensor product decompositions of $l(\gamma)$ for icc countable groups $\gamma$that are measure equivalent to a product of non-elementary hyperbolic groups.in particular, we show that $l(\gamma)$ is prime, unless $\gamma$ is a productof infinite groups, in which case we prove a unique prime factorization resultfor $l(\gamma)$.
