we provide a natural geometric setting for symmetric howe duality. this isrealized as a (loop) sl(n) action on derived categories of coherent sheaves oncertain varieties arising in the geometry of the beilinson-drinfeldgrassmannian.  the main construction parallels our earlier work on categorical sl(n) actionsand skew howe duality. in that case the varieties involved arose in thegeometry of the affine grassmannian. we discuss some relationships between thetwo actions.
