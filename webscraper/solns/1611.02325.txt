in additive white gaussian noise (awgn) channel, chaos has been proved to bethe optimal coherent communication waveform in the sense of using very simplematched filter to maximize the signal-to-noise ratio (snr). recently, lyapunovexponent spectrum of the chaotic signals after being transmitted through awireless channel has been shown to be unaltered, paving the way for wirelesscommunication using chaos. in wireless communication systems, inter-symbolinterference (isi) caused by multipath propagation is one of the main obstaclesto achieve high bit transmission rate and low bit error rate (ber). how toresist multipath effect is a fundamental problem in a chaos-based wirelesscommunication system (cwcs). in this paper, implementation of a cwcs ispresented. it is built to transmit chaotic signals generated by a hybriddynamical system and then to filter the received signals by using thecorresponding matched filter to decrease the noise effect and to detect thebinary information. we find that the multipath effect can be effectivelyresisted by regrouping the return map of the received signal and by setting thecorresponding threshold based on the available information. we show that theoptimal threshold is a function of the channel parameters and of thetransmitted information symbols. practically, the channel parameters aretime-variant, and the future information symbols are unavailable. in this case,a suboptimal threshold (sot) is proposed, and the ber using the sot is derivedanalytically. simulation results show that the cwcs achieves a remarkablecompetitive performance even under inaccurate channel parameters.
