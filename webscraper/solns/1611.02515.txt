a well-known feature of quantum mechanics is the secure exchange of secretbit strings which can then be used as keys to encrypt messages transmitted overany classical communication channel. it is demonstrated that this quantum keydistribution allows a much more general and abstract access than commonlythought. the results include some generalizations for the hilbert space versionof quantum key distribution,but base upon a general non-classical extension ofconditional probability. a special state-independent conditional probability isidentified as origin of the superior security of quantum key distribution andmay have more profound implications for the foundations and interpretation ofquantum mechanics,quantum information theory, and the philosophical questionwhat actually constitutes physical reality.
