in the same way as the quantum no-cloning theorem and quantum keydistribution in two preceding papers, entanglement-assisted quantumteleportation and grover's search algorithm are generalized by transferringthem to an abstract setting, including usual quantum mechanics as a specialcase. this again shows that a much more general and abstract access to thesequantum mechanical features is possible than commonly thought. a non-classicalextension of conditional probability and, particularly, a very special type ofstate-independent conditional probability are used instead of hilbert spacesand wavefunctions.
