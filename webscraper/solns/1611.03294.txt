we study the critical probability for the metastable phase transition of thetwo-dimensional anisotropic bootstrap percolation model with$(1,2)$-neighbourhood and threshold $r = 3$. the first order asymptotics forthe critical probability were recently determined by the first and secondauthors. here we determine the following sharp second and third orderasymptotics: \[  p_c\big( [l]^2,\mathcal{n}_{(1,2)},3 \big) \; = \; \frac{(\log \logl)^2}{12\log l} \, - \, \frac{\log \log l \, \log \log \log l}{ 3\log l}  + \frac{\left(\log \frac{9}{2} + 1 \pm o(1) \right)\log \log l}{6\log l}. \]we note that the second and third order terms are so large that the first orderasymptotics fail to approximate $p_c$ even for lattices of size well beyond$10^{10^{1000}}$.
