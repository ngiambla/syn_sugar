single type and multitype branching process have been used to study thedynamics of a variety of stochastic birth-death type phenomena in biology andphysics. their use in epidemiology goes back to whittle's study of asusceptible--infected--recovered (sir) model in the 1950s. in the case of ansir model, the presence of only one infectious class allows for the use ofsingle type branching processes. multitype branching processes allow formultiple infectious classes and have latterly been used to study metapopulationmodels of disease. in this article, we develop a continuous time markov chain(ctmc) model of infectious salmon anemia virus in two patches, two ctmc modelsin one patch and companion multitype branching process (mtbp) models. the ctmcmodels are related to deterministic models which inform the choice ofparameters. the probability of extinction is computed for the ctmc vianumerical methods and approximated by the mtbp in the supercritical regime. thestochastic models are treated as toy models and the parameter choices are madeto highlight regions of the parameter space where ctmc and mtbp agree ordisagree, without regard to biological significance. partial extinction eventsare defined and their relevance discussed. a case is made for calculating theprobability of such events, noting that mtbp's are not suitable for makingthese calculations.
