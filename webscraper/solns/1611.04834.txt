product codes are a concatenated error-correction scheme that has been oftenconsidered for applications requiring very low bit-error rates, which demandthat the error floor be decreased as much as possible. in this work, weconsider product codes constructed from polynomial algebraic codes, and proposea novel low-complexity post-processing technique that is able to improve theerror-correction performance by orders of magnitude. we provide lower boundsfor the error rate achievable under post processing, and present simulationresults indicating that these bounds are tight.
