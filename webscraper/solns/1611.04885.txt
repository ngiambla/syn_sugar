this survey paper is a structured concise summary of four of our recentpapers on the stochastic regularity of diffusions that are associated toregular strongly local (but not necessarily symmetric) dirichlet forms. here bystochastic regularity we mean the question whether a diffusion associated to adirichlet form as mentioned above can be started and identified as a solutionto an explicit stochastic differential equation for explicitly given startingpoints. beyond the stochastic regularity, we consider its applications tostrong existence and pathwise uniqueness of singular stochastic differentialequations.
