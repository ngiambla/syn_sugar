we introduce a new spin chain which is a deformation of the fredkin spinchain and has a phase transition between bounded and extensive entanglemententropy scaling. in this chain, spins have a local interaction of three nearestneighbors. the hamiltonian is frustration-free and its ground state can bedescribed analytically as a weighted superposition of dyck paths. in the purelyspin $1/2$ case, the entanglement entropy obeys an area law: it is bounded fromabove by a constant, when the size of the block $n$ increases (and $t>1$). whena local color degree of freedom is introduced the entanglement entropyincreases linearly with the size of the block (and $t>1$). the entanglemententropy of half of the chain is tightly bounded by ${ n}\log s$ where $n$ isthe size of the block, and $s$ is the number of colors. our chain fosters a newexample for a significant boost to entropy and for the existence of theassociated critical rainbow phase where the entanglement entropy scales withvolume that has recently been discovered in zhang et al.
