a notorious problem in mathematics and physics is to create a solvable modelfor random sequential adsorption of non-overlapping congruent spheres in the$d$-dimensional euclidean space with $d\geq 2$. spheres arrive sequentially atuniformly chosen locations in space and are accepted only when there is nooverlap with previously deposited spheres. due to spatial correlations,characterizing the fraction of accepted spheres remains largely intractable. westudy this fraction by taking a novel approach that compares random sequentialadsorption in euclidean space to the nearest-neighbor blocking on a sequence ofclustered random graphs. this random network model can be thought of as acorrected mean-field model for the interaction graph between the attemptedspheres. using functional limit theorems, we characterize the fraction ofaccepted spheres and its fluctuations.
