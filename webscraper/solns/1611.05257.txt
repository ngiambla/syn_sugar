in 1994 s. bullett and c. penrose introduced the one complex parameter familyof $(2:2)$ holomorphic correspondences $\mathcal{f}_a$:$$\left(\frac{aw-1}{w-1}\right)^2+\left(\frac{aw-1}{w-1}\right)\left(\frac{az+1}{z+1}\right)+\left(\frac{az+1}{z+1}\right)^2=3$$ and proved that for every value of $a \in[4,7] \subset \mathbb{r}$ the correspondence $\mathcal{f}_a$ is a matingbetween a quadratic polynomial $q_c(z)=z^2+c,\,\,c \in \mathbb{r}$ and themodular group $\gamma=psl(2,\mathbb{z})$. they conjectured that this is thecase for every member of the family $\mathcal{f}_a$ which has $a$ in theconnectedness locus.  we prove here that every member of the family $\mathcal{f}_a$ which has $a$in the connectedness locus is a mating between the modular group and an elementof the parabolic quadratic family $per_1(1)$.
