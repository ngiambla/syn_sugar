in this work, we abstract some key ingredients in previous lwe- andrlwe-based key exchange protocols, by introducing and formalizing the buildingtool, referred to as key consensus (kc) and its asymmetric variant akc. kc andakc allow two communicating parties to reach consensus from close valuesobtained by some secure information exchange. we then discover upper bounds onparameters for any kc and akc. kc and akc are fundamental to lattice basedcryptography, in the sense that a list of cryptographic primitives based onlwr, lwe and rlwe (including key exchange, public-key encryption, and more) canbe modularly constructed from them. as a conceptual contribution, this muchsimplifies the design and analysis of these cryptosystems in the future.  we then design and analyze both general and highly practical kc and akcschemes, which are referred to as okcn and akcn respectively for presentationsimplicity. based on kc and akc, we present generic constructions of keyexchange (ke) from lwr, lwe and rlwe. the generic construction allows versatileinstantiations with our okcn and akcn schemes, for which we elaborate onevaluating and choosing the concrete parameters in order to achieve anoptimally-balanced performance among security, computational cost, bandwidthefficiency, error rate, and operation simplicity.
