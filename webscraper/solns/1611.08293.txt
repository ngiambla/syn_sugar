in this paper, we study the effect of dependence on detecting sparse signals.in particular, we focus on global testing against sparse alternatives for themeans of binary outcomes following an ising model, and establish how theinterplay between the strength and sparsity of a signal determines itsdetectability under various notions of dependence. the profound impact ofdependence is best illustrated under the curie-weiss model where we observe theeffect of a "thermodynamic" phase transition. in particular, the critical stateexhibits a subtle "blessing of dependence" phenomenon in that one can detectmuch weaker signals at criticality than otherwise. furthermore, we develop atesting procedure that is broadly applicable to account for dependence and showthat it is asymptotically minimax optimal under fairly general regularityconditions.
