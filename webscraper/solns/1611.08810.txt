in this paper we want to define the kohnen plus space for hilbert modularforms with a odd square-free level and a quadratic character by arepresentation-theoretic way. we will show that in the classical case the onewe defined is the same with the one given by kohnen. also, we will interpretthe actions of the hecke operators on the new forms in the plus space and givea characterization for the new forms using hecke operators. all the resultswith respect to hecke operators can are comparable with the integral weightcase.
