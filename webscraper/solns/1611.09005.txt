space-time covariance modeling under the lagrangian framework has beenespecially popular to study atmospheric phenomena in the presence of transporteffects, such as prevailing winds or ocean currents, which are incompatiblewith the assumption of full symmetry. in this work, we assess the dimpleproblem (kent et al., 2011) for covariance functions coming from transportphenomena. we work under two important cases: the spatial domain can be eitherthe $d$-dimensional euclidean space $\mathbb{r}^d$ or the spherical shell of$\mathbb{r}^d$. the choice is relevant for the type of metric chosen todescribe spatial dependence. in particular, in euclidean spaces, we work undervery general assumptions with the case of radial symmetry being deduced as acorollary of a more general result. we illustrate through examples that, underthis framework, the dimple is a natural and physically interpretable property.
