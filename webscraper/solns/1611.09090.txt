a classical p\'olya urn scheme is a markov process whose evolution is encodedby a replacement matrix $(r_{i,j})_{1\leq i,j\leq d}$. at every discretetime-step, we draw a ball uniformly at random, denote its colour $c$, andreplace it in the urn together with $r_{c,j}$ balls of colour $j$ (for all$1\leq j\leq d$).  we are interested in multi-drawing p\'olya urns, where the replacement ruledepends on the random drawing of a set of $m$ balls from the urn (with orwithout replacement). this generalisation has already been studied in theliterature, in particular by kuba & mahmoud (arxiv:1503.09069 and 1509.09053),where second order asymptotic results are proved for $2$-colour urns under thebalanced and the affinity assumptions.  the main idea of this work is to apply stochastic approximation methods tothis problem, which enables us to remove the affinity hypothesis of kuba &mahmoud and generalise the result to more-than-two-colour urns. we also givesome partial results in the two-colour non-balanced case.
