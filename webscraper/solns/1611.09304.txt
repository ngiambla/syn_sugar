the growing popularity of bike-sharing systems around the world has motivatedrecent attention to models and algorithms for the effective operation of thesesystems. most of this literature focuses on their daily operation for managingasymmetric demand. in this work, we consider the more strategic question of howto (re-)allocate dock-capacity in such systems. we develop mathematicalformulations for variations of this problem (service performance over thecourse of one day, long-run- average performance) and exhibit discrete convexproperties in associated optimization problems. this allows us to design apractically fast polynomial-time allocation algorithm to compute optimalsolutions for this problem, which can also handle practically motivatedconstraints, such as a limit on the number of docks moved in the system.  we apply our algorithm to data sets from boston, new york city, and chicagoto investigate how different dock allocations can yield better service in thesesystems. recommendations based on our analysis have been adopted by systemoperators in boston and new york city. beyond optimizing for improved qualityof service through better allocations, our results also quantify the reductionin rebalancing achievable through strategically reallocating docks.
