we consider the problem of estimation of a linear functional in the gaussiansequence model where the unknown vector theta in r^d belongs to a class ofs-sparse vectors with unknown s. we suggest an adaptive estimator achieving anon-asymptotic rate of convergence that differs from the minimax rate at mostby a logarithmic factor. we also show that this optimal adaptive rate cannot beimproved when s is unknown. furthermore, we address the issue of simultaneousadaptation to s and to the variance sigma^2 of the noise. we suggest anestimator that achieves the optimal adaptive rate when both s and sigma^2 areunknown.
