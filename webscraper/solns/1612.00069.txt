a differential-algebraic geometric analogue of the dixmier-moeglinequivalence is articulated, and proven to hold for $d$-groups over theconstants. the model theory of differentially closed fields of characteristiczero, in particular the notion of analysability in the constants, plays acentral role. as an application it is shown that if $r$ is a commutative affinehopf algebra over a field of characteristic zero, and $a$ is an ore extensionto which the hopf algebra structure extends, then $a$ satisfies the classicaldixmier-moeglin equivalence. along the way it is shown that all such $a$ arehopf ore extensions
