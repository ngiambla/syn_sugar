knowledge of patients affective state could prove to be crucial forhealth-care professionals in both diagnosis and treatment, however, thisrequires patients to report how they feel. in practice the sampling rate ofaffective states needs to be kept low, in order to ensure that the patients canrest. furthermore using traditional methods of measuring affective states, isnot always possible, e.g. patients can be incapable of verbal communications.in this study we explore the prediction of peoples self-reported affectivestate by measuring multiple physiological signals. we use different neuralnetworks (nn) setups and compare with different multiple linear regression(mlr) setups for prediction of changes in affective states. the results showedthat nn and mlr predicted the change in affective states with accuracies of91.88% and 89.10%, respectively.
