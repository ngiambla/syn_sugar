  knowledge of patients affective state could prove to be crucial for
health-care professionals in both diagnosis and treatment, however, this
requires patients to report how they feel. in practice the sampling rate of
affective states needs to be kept low, in order to ensure that the patients can
rest. furthermore using traditional methods of measuring affective states, is
not always possible, e.g. patients can be incapable of verbal communications.
in this study we explore the prediction of peoples self-reported affective
state by measuring multiple physiological signals. we use different neural
networks (nn) setups and compare with different multiple linear regression
(mlr) setups for prediction of changes in affective states. the results showed
that nn and mlr predicted the change in affective states with accuracies of
91.88% and 89.10%, respectively.
