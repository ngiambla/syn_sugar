measuring centrality in a social network, especially in bipartite mode, posesseveral challenges such as requirement of full knowledge of the networktopology and lack of properly detection of top-k behavioral representativeusers. in this paper, to overcome the aforementioned challenging issues, wepropose an accurate centrality measure, called hellrank, to identify centralnodes in bipartite social networks. hellrank is based on the hellinger distancebetween two nodes on the same side of a bipartite network. we theoreticallyanalyze the impact of the hellinger distance on a bipartite network and find anupper and lower bounds for this distance. the computation of hellrankcentrality measure can be distributed by letting each node uses only localinformation on its immediate neighbors and therefore do not need a centralentity to have full knowledge of the network topological structure. weexperimentally evaluate performance of the hellrank measure in correlation withother centrality measures on real-world networks. the results show partialranking similarity between the hellrank and the other conventional metricsaccording to the kendall and spearman rank correlation coefficient.
