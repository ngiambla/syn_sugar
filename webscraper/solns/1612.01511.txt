  measuring centrality in a social network, especially in bipartite mode, poses
several challenges such as requirement of full knowledge of the network
topology and lack of properly detection of top-k behavioral representative
users. in this paper, to overcome the aforementioned challenging issues, we
propose an accurate centrality measure, called hellrank, to identify central
nodes in bipartite social networks. hellrank is based on the hellinger distance
between two nodes on the same side of a bipartite network. we theoretically
analyze the impact of the hellinger distance on a bipartite network and find an
upper and lower bounds for this distance. the computation of hellrank
centrality measure can be distributed by letting each node uses only local
information on its immediate neighbors and therefore do not need a central
entity to have full knowledge of the network topological structure. we
experimentally evaluate performance of the hellrank measure in correlation with
other centrality measures on real-world networks. the results show partial
ranking similarity between the hellrank and the other conventional metrics
according to the kendall and spearman rank correlation coefficient.
