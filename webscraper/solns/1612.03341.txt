this paper considers a multivariate spatial random field, with each componenthaving univariate marginal distributions of the skew-gaussian type. we assumethat the field is defined spatially on the unit sphere embedded in$\mathbb{r}^3$, allowing for modeling data available over large portions ofplanet earth. this model admits explicit expressions for the marginal and crosscovariances. however, the $n$-dimensional distributions of the field aredifficult to evaluate, because it requires the sum of $2^n$ terms involving thecumulative and probability density functions of a $n$-dimensional gaussiandistribution. since in this case inference based on the full likelihood iscomputationally unfeasible, we propose a composite likelihood approach based onpairs of spatial observations. this last being possible thanks to the fact thatwe have a closed form expression for the bivariate distribution. we illustratethe effectiveness of the method through simulation experiments and the analysisof a real data set of minimum and maximum temperatures.
