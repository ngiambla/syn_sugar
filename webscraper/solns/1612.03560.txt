in this paper, we investigate pn-sequences with ideal autocorrelationproperty and the consequences of this property on the number of +1s and -1s andrun structure of sequences. we begin by discussing and surveying about thelength of pnsequences with ideal autocorrelation property. from our discussionand survey we introduce circulant matrix representation of pn-sequence. throughcirculant matrix representation we obtain system of non-linear equations thatlead to ideal autocorrelation property. rewriting pn-sequence and itsautocorrelation property in {0,1} leads to a definition based on hamming weightand hamming distance and hence we can easily prove some results on thepn-sequences with ideal autocorrelation property.
