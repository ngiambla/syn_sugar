conventional ways to solve optimization problems on low-rank matrix setswhich appear in great number of applications ignore its underlying structure ofan algebraic variety and existence of singular points. this leads to appearanceof inverses of singular values in algorithms and since they could be close to$0$ it causes certain problems. we tackle this problem by utilizing ideas fromthe algebraic geometry and show how to desingularize these sets. our mainresult is algorithm which uses only bounded functions of singular values andhence does not suffer from the issue described above.
