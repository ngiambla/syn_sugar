non-negative matrix factorization (nmf) is a new knowledge discovery methodthat is used for text mining, signal processing, bioinformatics, and consumeranalysis. however, its basic property as a learning machine is not yetclarified, as it is not a regular statistical model, resulting that theoreticaloptimization method of nmf has not yet established. in this paper, we study thereal log canonical threshold of nmf and give an upper bound of thegeneralization error in bayesian learning. the results show that thegeneralization error of the matrix factorization can be made smaller thanregular statistical models if bayesian learning is applied.
