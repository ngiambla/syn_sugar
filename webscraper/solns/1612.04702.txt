the slow-coloring game is played by lister and painter on a graph $g$. oneach round, lister marks a nonempty subset $m$ of the remaining vertices,scoring $|m|$ points. painter then gives a color to a subset of $m$ that isindependent in $g$. the game ends when all vertices are colored. painter's goalis to minimize the total score; lister seeks to maximize it. the score thateach player can guarantee doing no worse than is the sum-color cost of $g$,written $\mathring{\rm s}(g)$. we develop a linear-time algorithm to compute$\mathring{\rm s}(g)$ when $g$ is a tree, enabling us to characterize the$n$-vertex trees with the largest and smallest values. our algorithm alsocomputes on trees the interactive sum choice number, a parameter recentlyintroduced by bonamy and meeks.
