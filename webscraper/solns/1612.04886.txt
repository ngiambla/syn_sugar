in this paper we show how the gl(n) voronoi summation formula of [misc2] canbe rewritten to incorporate hyper-kloosterman sums of various dimensions onboth sides. this generalizes a formula for gl(4) with ordinary kloosterman sumson both sides that was considered by xiaoqing li and the first-named author,and later by the second-named author in [zho].
