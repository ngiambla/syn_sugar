we construct equivalent semi-norms of non-local dirichlet forms on thesierpi\'nski gasket and apply these semi-norms to a convergence problem and atrace problem. we also construct explicitly a sequence of non-local dirichletforms with jumping kernels equivalent to $|x-y|^{-\alpha-\beta}$ that convergesexactly to local dirichlet form.
