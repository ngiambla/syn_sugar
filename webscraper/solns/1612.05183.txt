we prove that demailly's holomorphic morse inequalities hold true for complexorbifolds by using a heat kernel method. then we introduce the class ofmoishezon orbifolds and as an application of our inequalties, we give ageometric criterion for a compact connected orbifold to be a moishezonorbifolds, thus generalizing siu's and demailly's answers to thegrauert-riemenschneider conjecture to the orbifold case.
