we introduce the notions of a $\mathbf{d}$-standard abelian category and a$\mathbf{k}$-standard additive category. we prove that for a finite dimensionalalgebra $a$, its module category is $\mathbf{d}$-standard if and only if anyderived autoequivalence on $a$ is standard, that is, given by a two-sidedtilting complex. we prove that if the subcategory of projective $a$-modules is$\mathbf{k}$-standard, then the module category is $\mathbf{d}$-standard. weprovide new examples of $\mathbf{d}$-standard module categories.
