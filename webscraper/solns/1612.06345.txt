the radiation pattern of an antenna array depends on the excitation weightsand the geometry of the array. due to wind and atmospheric conditions, outdoormillimeter wave antenna elements are subject to full or partial blockages froma plethora of particles like dirt, salt, ice, and water droplets. handhelddevices are also subject to blockages from random finger placement and/orfinger prints. these blockages cause absorption and scattering to the signalincident on the array, and change the array geometry. this distorts thefar-field radiation pattern of the array leading to an increase in the sidelobelevel and decrease in gain. this paper studies the effects of blockages on thefar-field radiation pattern of linear arrays and proposes two array diagnosistechniques for millimeter wave antenna arrays. the proposed techniques jointlyestimate the locations of the blocked antennas and the induced attenuation andphase shifts. numerical results show that the proposed techniques providesatisfactory results in terms of fault detection with reduced number ofmeasurements (diagnosis time) provided that the number of blockages is smallcompared to the array size.
