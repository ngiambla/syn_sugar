demand for data science education is surging and traditional courses offeredby statistics departments are not meeting the needs of those seeking training.this has led to a number of opinion pieces advocating for an update to thestatistics curriculum. the unifying recommendation is computing should play amore prominent role. we strongly agree with this recommendation, but advocatethe main priority is to bring applications to the forefront as proposed bynolan and speed (1999). we also argue that the individuals tasked withdeveloping data science courses should not only have statistical training, butalso have experience analyzing data with the main objective of solvingreal-world problems. here, we share a set of general principles and offer adetailed guide derived from our successful experience developing and teaching agraduate-level, introductory data science course centered entirely on casestudies. we argue for the importance of statistical thinking, as defined bywild and pfannkuck (1999) and describe how our approach teaches students threekey skills needed to succeed in data science, which we refer to as creating,connecting, and computing. this guide can also be used for statisticianswanting to gain more practical knowledge about data science before embarking onteaching an introductory course.
