the approximation numbers of the $l_2$-embedding of mixed order sobolevfunctions on the $d$-torus are well studied. they are given as thenonincreasing rearrangement of the $d$-th tensor power of the approximationnumber sequence in the univariate case. i present results on the asymptotic andpreasymptotic behavior for tensor powers of arbitrary sequences of polynomialdecay. this can be used to study the approximation numbers of many other tensorproduct operators, like the embedding of mixed order sobolev functions on the$d$-cube into $l_2\left([0,1]^d\right)$ or the embedding of mixed order jacobifunctions on the $d$-cube into $l_2\left([0,1]^d,w_d\right)$ with jacobi weight$w_d$.
