let $n \geq r \geq s \geq 0$ be integers and $\mathcal{f}$ a family of$r$-subsets of $[n]$. let $w_{r,s}^{\mathcal{f}}$ be the higher inclusionmatrix of the subsets in ${\mathcal f}$ vs. the $s$-subsets of $[n]$. when$\mathcal{f}$ consists of all $r$-subsets of $[n]$, we shall simply write$w_{r,s}$ in place of $w_{r,s}^{\mathcal{f}}$. in this paper we prove that therank of the higher inclusion matrix $w_{r,s}$ over an arbitrary field $k$ isresilient. that is, if the size of $\mathcal{f}$ is "close" to ${n \choose r}$then $\mbox{rank}_{k}(w_{r,s}^{\mathcal{f}}) = \mbox{rank}_{k}(w_{r,s})$, where$k$ is an arbitrary field. furthermore, we prove that the rank (over a field$k$) of the higher inclusion matrix of $r$-subspaces vs. $s$-subspaces of an$n$-dimensional vector space over $\mathbb{f}_q$ is also resilient if ${\rmchar}(k)$ is coprime to $q$.
