a theory for the evolution of a metric $g$ driven by the equations ofthree-dimensional continuum mechanics is developed. this metric in turn allowsfor the local existence of an evolving three-dimensional riemannian manifoldimmersed in the six-dimensional euclidean space. the nash-kuiper theorem isthen applied to this riemannian manifold to produce a wild evolving $c^{1}$manifold. the theory is applied to the incompressible euler and navier-stokesequations. one practical outcome of the theory is a computation of criticalprofile initial data for what may be interpreted as the onset of turbulence forthe classical incompressible navier-stokes equations.
