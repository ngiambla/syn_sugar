a general conjecture is stated on the cone of automorphic vector bundlesadmitting nonzero global sections on schemes endowed with a smooth, surjectivemorphism to a stack of $g$-zips of connected-hodge-type; such schemes shouldinclude all hodge-type shimura varieties with hyperspecial level. we prove ourconjecture for groups of type $a_1^n$, $c_2$ and $\mathbf f_p$-split groups oftype $a_2$ (this includes all hilbert-blumenthal varieties and should alsoapply to siegel modular threefolds and picard modular surfaces). an example isgiven to show that our conjecture can fail for zip data not ofconnected-hodge-type.
