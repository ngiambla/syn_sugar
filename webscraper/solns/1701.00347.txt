perturbative series of some quantities in quantum field theories, such as thepole mass of a quark, suffer from a kind of divergence called renormalondivergence. in this paper, the leading renormalon in the pole mass isinvestigated, and a map is introduced to suppress this renormalon. the inverseof the map is then used to generate the leading renormalon and obtain anexpression to calculate its overall normalization. finally, the overallnormalization of the leading renormalon of the pole mass is calculated forseveral values of quark flavors.
