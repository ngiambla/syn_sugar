we consider the quantum-classical correspondence from a classical perspectiveby discussing the potential for chaotic systems to support behaviors normallyassociated with quantum mechanical systems. our main analytical tool is achaotic system's set of cupolets, which are essentially highly-accuratestabilizations of its unstable periodic orbits. the discussion is motivated bythe bound or entangled states that we have recently detected betweeninteracting chaotic systems, wherein pairs of cupolets are induced into a stateof mutually-sustaining stabilization that can be maintained without externalintervention. this state is known as chaotic entanglement as it has been shownto exhibit several properties consistent with quantum entanglement. forinstance, should the interaction be disturbed, then the chaotic entanglementwould be broken. in this paper, we further describe chaotic entanglement and goon to discuss the capacity for chaotic systems to exhibit other characteristicsthat are conventionally associated with quantum mechanics, namely analogs towave function collapse, the measurement problem, the superposition of states,and to quantum entropy definitions. in doing so, we argue that thesecharacteristics need not be regarded exclusively as quantum mechanical.
