airbnb, an online marketplace for accommodations, has experienced astaggering growth accompanied by intense debates and scattered regulationsaround the world. current discourses, however, are largely focused on opinionsrather than empirical evidences. here, we aim to bridge this gap by presentingthe first large-scale measurement study on airbnb, using a crawled data setcontaining 2.3 million listings, 1.3 million hosts, and 19.3 million reviews.we measure several key characteristics at the heart of the ongoing debate andthe sharing economy. among others, we find that airbnb has reached a global yetheterogeneous coverage. the majority of its listings across many countries areentire homes, suggesting that airbnb is actually more like a rental marketplacerather than a spare-room sharing platform. analysis on star-ratings revealsthat there is a bias toward positive ratings, amplified by a bias toward usingpositive words in reviews. the extent of such bias is greater than yelpreviews, which were already shown to exhibit a positive bias. we investigate akey issue---commercial hosts who own multiple listings on airbnb---repeatedlydiscussed in the current debate. we find that their existence is prevalent,they are early-movers towards joining airbnb, and their listings aredisproportionately entire homes and located in the us. our work advances thecurrent understanding of how airbnb is being used and may serve as anindependent and empirical reference to inform the debate.
