in this paper we consider some insurance policies related to drawdown anddrawup events of log-returns for an underlying asset modeled by a spectrallynegative geometric l\'evy process. we consider four contracts, three of whichwere introduced in zhang et al. (2013) for a geometric brownian motion. thefirst one is an insurance contract where the protection buyer pays a constantpremium until the drawdown of fixed size of log-returns occurs. in returnhe/she receives a certain insured amount at the drawdown epoch. the nextinsurance contract provides protection from any specified drawdown with adrawup contingency. this contract expires early if a certain fixed drawup eventoccurs prior to the fixed drawdown. the last two contracts are extensions ofthe previous ones by an additional cancellation feature which allows theinvestor to terminate the contract earlier. we focus on two problems:calculating the fair premium $p$ for the basic contracts and identifying theoptimal stopping rule for the policies with the cancellation feature. to dothis we solve some two-sided exit problems related to drawdown and drawup ofspectrally negative l\'evy processes, which is of independent mathematicalinterest. we also heavily rely on the theory of optimal stopping.
