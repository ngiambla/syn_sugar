in \cite{b} bourgain proves that sarnak's disjointness conjecture holds for acertain class of three-interval exchange maps. in the present paper we slightlyimprove the diophantine condition of bourgain and estimate the constants in theproof. we further show, that the new parameter set has positive, but not fullhausdorff dimension. this, in particular, implies that the lebesgue measure ofthis set is zero.
