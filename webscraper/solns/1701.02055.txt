we study the categorical framework for the computation of persistenthomology, without reliance on a particular computational algorithm. thecomputation of persistent homology is commonly summarized as a matrix theorem,which we call the matrix structural theorem. any of the various algorithms forcomputing persistent homology constitutes a constructive proof of the matrixstructural theorem. we showthat the matrix structural theorem is equivalent tothe krull-schmidt property of the category of filtered chain complexes. weseparately establish the krull-schmidt property by abstract categoricalmethods, yielding a novel nonconstructive proof of the matrix structuraltheorem.  these results provide the foundation for an alternate categorical frameworkfor decomposition in persitent homology, bypassing the usual persistence vectorspaces and quiver representations.
