let $w$ be a coxeter group. the goal of the paper is to construct new hopfalgebras that contain hecke algebras $h_{\bf q}(w)$ as (left) coidealsubalgebras. our hecke-hopf algebras ${\bf h}(w)$ have a number ofapplications. in particular they provide new solutions of quantum yang-baxterequation and lead to a construction of a new family of endo-functors of thecategory of $h_{\bf q}(w)$-modules. hecke-hopf algebras for the symmetric groupare related to fomin-kirillov algebras, for an arbitrary coxeter group $w$ the"demazure" part of ${\bf h}(w)$ is being acted upon by generalized braidedderivatives which generate the corresponding (generalized) nichols algebra.
