we propose a new cellular network model that captures both deterministic andrandom aspects of base station deployments. namely, the base station locationsare modeled as the superposition of two independent stationary point processes:a random shifted grid with intensity $\lambda_g$ and a poisson point process(ppp) with intensity $\lambda_p$. grid and ppp deployments are special caseswith $\lambda_p \to 0$ and $\lambda_g \to 0$, with actual deployments inbetween these two extremes, as we demonstrate with deployment data. assumingthat each user is associated with the base station that provides the strongestaverage received signal power, we obtain the probability that a typical user isassociated with either a grid or ppp base station. assuming rayleigh fadingchannels, we derive the expression for the coverage probability of the typicaluser, resulting in the following observations. first, the association and thecoverage probability of the typical user are fully characterized as functionsof intensity ratio $\rho_\lambda = \lambda_p/\lambda_g$. second, the userassociation is biased towards the base stations located on a grid. finally, theproposed model predicts the coverage probability of the actual deployment withgreat accuracy.
