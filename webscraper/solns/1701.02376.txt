we discuss the existence of ground state solutions for the choquard equation$$-\delta u=(i_\alpha*f(u))f'(u)\quad\quad\quad\text{in }\mathbb r^n.$$ weprove the existence of solutions under general hypotheses, investigating inparticular the case of a homogeneous nonlinearity $f(u)=\frac{|u|^p}p$. thecases $n=2$ and $n\ge3$ are treated differently in some steps. the solutionsare found through a variational mountain pass strategy. the result presentedare contained in the papers with arxiv id 1212.2027 and 1604.03294
