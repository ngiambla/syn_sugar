we provide a perturbative expansion for the empirical spectral distributionof a hermitian matrix with large size perturbed by a random matrix with smalloperator norm whose entries in the eigenvector basis of the first one areindependent with a variance profile. we prove that, depending on the order ofmagnitude of the perturbation, several regimes can appear, called perturbativeand semi-perturbative regimes. depending on the regime, the leading terms ofthe expansion are either related to the one-dimensional gaussian free field orto free probability theory.
