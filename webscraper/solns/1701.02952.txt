  recent research in software engineering supports the "happy-productive"
thesis, and the desire of flourishing happiness among programmers is often
expressed by industry practitioners. recent literature has suggested that a
cost-effective way to foster happiness and productivity among workers could be
to limit unhappiness of developers due to its negative impact. however,
possible negative effects of unhappiness are still largely unknown in the
software development context. in this paper, we present the first results from
a study exploring the consequences of the unhappy developers. using qualitative
data analysis of the survey responses given by 181 participants, we identified
49 potential consequences of unhappiness while developing software. these
results have several implications. while raising the awareness of the role of
moods, emotions and feelings in software development, we foresee that our
classification scheme will spawn new happiness studies linking causes and
effects, and it can act as a guideline for developers and managers to foster
happiness at work.
