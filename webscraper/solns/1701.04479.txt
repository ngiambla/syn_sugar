we discuss the question of geometric formality for rationally ellipticmanifolds of dimension $6$ and $7$. we prove that a geometrically formalsix-dimensional biquotient with $b_{2}=3$ has the real cohomology of asymmetric space. we also show that a rationally hyperbolic six-dimensionalmanifold with $b_2\leq 2$ and $b_3=0$ can not be geometrically formal. as itfollows from their real homotopy classification, the seven-dimensionalgeometrically formal rationally elliptic manifolds have the real cohomology ofsymmetric spaces as well.
