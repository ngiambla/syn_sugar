the analysis of the entanglement entropy of a subsystem of a one-dimensionalquantum system is a powerful tool for unravelling its critical nature. forinstance, the scaling behaviour of the entanglement entropy determines thecentral charge of the associated virasoro algebra. for a free fermion system,the entanglement entropy depends essentially on two sets, namely the set $a$ ofsites of the subsystem considered and the set $k$ of excited momentum modes. inthis work we make use of a general duality principle establishing theinvariance of the entanglement entropy under exchange of the sets $a$ and $k$to tackle complex problems by studying their dual counterparts. the dualityprinciple is also a key ingredient in the formulation of a novel conjecture forthe asymptotic behavior of the entanglement entropy of a free fermion system inthe general case in which both sets $a$ and $k$ consist of an arbitrary numberof blocks. we have verified that this conjecture reproduces the numericalresults with excellent precision for all the configurations analyzed. we havealso applied the conjecture to deduce several asymptotic formulas for themutual and $r$-partite information generalizing the known ones for the singleblock case.
