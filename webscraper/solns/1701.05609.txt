although applications of bayesian analysis for numerical quadrature problemshave been considered before, it's only very recently that statisticians havefocused on the connections between statistics and numerical analysis ofdifferential equations. in line with this very recent trend, we show howcertain commonly used finite difference schemes for numerical solutions ofordinary and partial differential equations can be considered in a regressionsetting. focusing on this regression framework, we apply a simple bayesianstrategy to obtain confidence intervals for the finite difference solutions. weapply this framework on several examples to show how the confidence intervalsare related to truncation error and illustrate the utility of the confidenceintervals for the examples considered.
