  the growing literature on affect among software developers mostly reports on
the linkage between happiness, software quality, and developer productivity.
understanding the positive side of happiness -- positive emotions and moods --
is an attractive and important endeavor. scholars in industrial and
organizational psychology have suggested that also studying the negative side
-- unhappiness -- could lead to cost-effective ways of enhancing working
conditions, job performance, and to limiting the occurrence of psychological
disorders. our comprehension of the consequences of (un)happiness among
developers is still too shallow, and is mainly expressed in terms of
development productivity and software quality. in this paper, we attempt to
uncover the experienced consequences of unhappiness among software developers.
using qualitative data analysis of the responses given by 181 questionnaire
participants, we identified 49 consequences of unhappiness while doing software
development. we found detrimental consequences on developers' mental
well-being, the software development process, and the produced artifacts. our
classification scheme, available as open data, will spawn new happiness
research opportunities of cause-effect type, and it can act as a guideline for
practitioners for identifying damaging effects of unhappiness and for fostering
happiness on the job.
