we analyse various perturbations and projections of kalman-bucy semigroupsand riccati equations. for example, covariance inflation-type perturbations andlocalisation methods (projections) are common in the ensemble kalman filteringliterature. in the limit of these ensemble methods, the regularised samplecovariance tends toward a solution of a perturbed/projected riccati equation.with this motivation, results are given characterising the error between thenominal and regularised riccati flows and kalman-bucy filtering distributions.new projection-type models are also discussed; e.g. bose-mesner projections.these regularisation models are also of interest on their own, and in, e.g.,differential games, control of stochastic/jump processes, and robust control.
