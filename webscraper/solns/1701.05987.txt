we study some properties of the dynamical realization of isolated left ordersof a countable group g. we show that the dynamical realization admits a uniqueminimal set provided g is not infinite cyclic. we show that convex subgroup ofan isolated left order is finite in number. using this, we give a dynamicalproof of the tararin theorem. we also show that there is a new isolated orderon the braid group b_3.
