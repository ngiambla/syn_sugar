we consider the problem of the construction of the acoustic structure ofarbitrary geometry with prescribed desired properties. we use optimizationapproach for the solution of this problem and minimize the tikhonov functionalon adaptively refined meshes. these meshes are refined locally only in placeswhere the acoustic structure should be designed. our special symmetric meshrefinement strategy together with interpolation procedure allows theconstruction of the symmetric acoustic material with prescribed properties.efficiency of the presented adaptive optimization algorithm is illustrated onthe construction of the symmetric acoustic material in two dimensions.
