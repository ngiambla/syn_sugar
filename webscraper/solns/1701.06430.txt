for a point set of $n$ elements in the $d$-dimensional unit cube and a classof test sets we are interested in the largest volume of a test set which doesnot contain any point. for all natural numbers $n$, $d$ and under theassumption of a $delta$-cover with cardinality $\vert \gamma_\delta \vert$ weprove that there is a point set, such that the largest volume of such a testset without any point is bounded by $\frac{\log \vert \gamma_\delta \vert}{n} +\delta$. for axis-parallel boxes on the unit cube this leads to a volume of atmost $\frac{4d}{n}\log(\frac{9n}{d})$ and on the torus to $\frac{4d}{n}\log(2n)$.
