stochastic iterative algorithms such as the kaczmarz and gauss-seidel methodshave gained recent attention because of their speed, simplicity, and theability to approximately solve large-scale linear systems of equations withoutneeding to access the entire matrix. in this work, we consider the settingwhere we wish to solve a linear system in a large matrix x that is stored in afactorized form, x = uv; this setting either arises naturally in manyapplications or may be imposed when working with large low-rank datasets forreasons of space required for storage. we propose a variant of the randomizedkaczmarz method for such systems that takes advantage of the factored form, andavoids computing x. we prove an exponential convergence rate and supplement ourtheoretical guarantees with experimental evidence demonstrating that thefactored variant yields significant acceleration in convergence.
