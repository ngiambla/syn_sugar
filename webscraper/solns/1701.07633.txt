we extend the ideas of (barbour 1990) and use stein's method to obtain abound on the distance between a scaled time-changed random walk and atime-changed brownian motion. we then apply this result to bound the distancebetween a time-changed compensated scaled poisson process and a time-changedbrownian motion. this allows us to bound the distance between a process whosedynamics resemble those of the moran model with mutation and a process whosedynamics resemble those of the wright-fisher diffusion with mutation uponnoting that the former may be expressed as a difference of two time-changedpoisson processes and the diffusive part of the latter may be expressed as atime-changed brownian motion. the method is applicable to a much wider class ofexamples satisfying the stroock-varadhan theory of diffusion approximation.
