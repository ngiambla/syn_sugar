we consider the first non-zero eigenvalue $\lambda_1$ of the laplacian onhyperbolic surfaces for which one disconnecting collar degenerates and provethat $8\pi \nabla\log(\lambda_1)$ essentially agrees with the dual of thedifferential of the degenerating fenchel-nielson length coordinate. as acorollary of our analysis we can improve previous results of schoen, wolpert,yau and burger to obtain estimates with optimal error rates.
