the kontsevich deformation quantization combines poisson dynamics,noncommutative geometry, number theory, and calculus of oriented graphs. tomanage the algebra and differential calculus of series of weighted graphs, wepresent software modules: these allow generating the kontsevich graphs,expanding the noncommutative $\star$-product by using a priori undeterminedcoefficients, and deriving linear relations between the weights of graphs.throughout this text we illustrate the assembly of the kontsevich$\star$-product up to order 4 in the deformation parameter $\hbar$. already atthis stage, the $\star$-product involves hundreds of graphs; expressing alltheir coefficients via 149 weights of basic graphs (of which 67 weights are nowknown exactly), we express the remaining 82 weights in terms of only 10parameters (more specifically, in terms of only 6 parameters modulogauge-equivalence). finally, we outline a scheme for computer-assisted proof ofthe associativity, modulo $\bar{o}(\hbar^4)$, for the newly built$\star$-product expansion.
