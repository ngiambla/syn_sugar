explicit coding schemes are proposed to achieve the rate-distortion functionof the heegard-berger problem using polar codes. specifically, a nested polarcode construction is employed to achieve the rate-distortion function for thedoubly-symmetric binary sources when the side information may be absent. thenested structure contains two optimal polar codes for lossy source coding andchannel coding, respectively. moreover, a similar nested polar latticeconstruction is employed when the source and the side information are jointlygaussian. the proposed polar lattice is constructed by nesting a quantizationpolar lattice and a capacity-achieving polar lattice for the additive whitegaussian noise channel.
