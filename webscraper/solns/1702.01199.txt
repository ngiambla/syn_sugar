we study the arithmetically cohen-macaulay (acm) property for finite sets ofpoints in multiprojective spaces, especially $(\mathbb p^1)^n$. a combinatorialcharacterization, the $(\star)$-property, is known in $\mathbb p^1 \times\mathbb p^1$. we propose a combinatorial property, $(\star_n)$, that directlygeneralizes the $(\star)$-property to $(\mathbb p^1)^n$ for larger $n$. we showthat $x$ is acm if and only if it satisfies the $(\star_n)$-property. the maintool for several of our results is an extension to the multiprojective settingof certain liaison methods in projective space.
