  crowd employment is a new form of short term and flexible employment which
has emerged during the past decade. for understanding this new form of
employment, it is crucial to understand the underlying motivations of the
workforce involved in it. this paper presents the multidimensional crowdworker
motivation scale (mcms), a scale for measuring the motivation of crowdworkers
on micro-task platforms. the scale is theoretically grounded in
self-determination theory and tailored specifically to the context of
crowdsourced micro-labor. the mcms was validated on data collected in ten
countries and three income groups. furthermore, measurement invariance tests
showed that motivations measured with the mcms are comparable across countries
and income groups. this work constitutes a first step towards understanding the
motivations of the international crowd workforce.
