crowd employment is a new form of short term and flexible employment whichhas emerged during the past decade. for understanding this new form ofemployment, it is crucial to understand the underlying motivations of theworkforce involved in it. this paper presents the multidimensional crowdworkermotivation scale (mcms), a scale for measuring the motivation of crowdworkerson micro-task platforms. the scale is theoretically grounded inself-determination theory and tailored specifically to the context ofcrowdsourced micro-labor. the mcms was validated on data collected in tencountries and three income groups. furthermore, measurement invariance testsshowed that motivations measured with the mcms are comparable across countriesand income groups. this work constitutes a first step towards understanding themotivations of the international crowd workforce.
