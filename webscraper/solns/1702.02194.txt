in order to solve two problems in deformation theory, we establish naturalstructures of homotopy lie algebras and of homotopy associative algebras ontensor products of algebras of different types and on mapping spaces betweencoalgebras and algebras. when considering tensor products, such algebraicstructures extend the lie algebra or associative algebra structures that can beobtained by means of the manin products of operads. these new homotopy algebrastructures are proven by to compatible with the concepts of homotopy theory:$\infty$-morphisms and the homotopy transfer theorem. we give a conceptualinterpretation of their maurer-cartan elements. in the end, this allows us toconstruct the deformation complex for morphisms of algebras over an operad andto represent the deformation $\infty$-groupoid for differential graded liealgebras.
