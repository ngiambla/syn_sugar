we study the existence problem for tilted unduloids in$\mathbb{h}^2\times\mathbb{r}$. these are singly periodic annuli with constantmean curvature $h>1/2$ in $\mathbb{h}^2\times\mathbb{r}$, and the periodicityof these surfaces is with respect to a discrete group of translations along ageodesic that is neither vertical nor horizontal in the riemannian product$\mathbb{h}^2\times\mathbb{r}$. via the daniel correspondence we are able toreduce this existence problem to a uniqueness problem in the berger spheres: ifa pair of linked horizontal geodesics bounds exactly two embedded minimalannuli (for a fixed orientation of the boundary curves) then tilted unduloidsin $\mathbb{h}^2\times\mathbb{r}$ exist.
