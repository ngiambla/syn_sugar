in [2], bowen showed that for an expansive system (x, t) with specificationand a potential with the bowen property, the equilibrium state is unique andfully supported. we generalize that result by showing that the same conclusionholds for non-uniform versions of bowen's hypotheses in which constantparameters are replaced by any increasing unbounded functions f(n) and g(n)with sublogarithmic growth (in n). we prove results for two weakenings ofspecification; the first is non-uniform specification, based on a definition ofmarcus in ([14]), and the second is a significantly weaker property which wecall non-uniform transitivity. we prove uniqueness of the equilibrium state inthe former case under the assumption that liminf (f(n) + g(n))/ln n = 0, and inthe latter case when lim (f(n) + g(n))/ln n = 0. in the former case, we alsoprove that the unique equilibrium state has the k-property. it is known thatwhen f(n)/ln n or g(n)/ln n is bounded from below, equilibrium states may notbe unique, and so this work shows that logarithmic growth is in fact theoptimal transition point below which uniqueness is guaranteed. finally, wepresent some examples for which our results yield the first known proof ofuniqueness of equilibrium state.
