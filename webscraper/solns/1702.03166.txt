in this paper,we consider a high-dimensional statistical estimation problemin which the the number of parameters is comparable or larger than the samplesize. we present a unified analysis of the performance guarantees ofexponential weighted aggregation and penalized estimators with a general classof data losses and priors which encourage objects which conform to some notionof simplicity/complexity. more precisely, we show that these two estimatorssatisfy sharp oracle inequalities for prediction ensuring their goodtheoretical performances. we also highlight the differences between them. whenthe noise is random, we provide oracle inequalities in probability usingconcentration inequalities. these results are then applied to several instancesincluding the lasso, the group lasso, their analysis-type counterparts, the$\ell_\infty$ and the nuclear norm penalties. all our estimators can beefficiently implemented using proximal splitting algorithms.
