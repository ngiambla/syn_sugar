graph-based methods have been proposed as a unified framework for discretecalculus of local and nonlocal image processing methods in the recent years. inorder to translate variational models and partial differential equations to agraph, certain operators have been investigated and successfully applied toreal-world applications involving graph models. so far the graph framework hasbeen limited to real- and vector-valued functions on euclidean domains. in thispaper we generalize this model to the case of manifold-valued data. weintroduce the basic calculus needed to formulate variational models and partialdifferential equations for manifold-valued functions and discuss the proposedgraph framework for two particular families of operators, namely, the isotropicand anisotropic graph~$p$-laplacian operators, $p\geq1$. based on the choice of$p$ we are in particular able to solve optimization problems on manifold-valuedfunctions involving total variation ($p=1$) and tikhonov ($p=2$)regularization. finally, we present numerical results from processing bothsynthetic as well as real-world manifold-valued data, e.g., from diffusiontensor imaging (dti) and light detection and ranging (lidar) data.
