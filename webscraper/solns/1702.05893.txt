in this article we study brill-noether loci of moduli space of stable bundlesover smooth surfaces. we define petri map as an analogy with the case ofcurves. we show the non-emptiness of certain brill-noether loci over verygeneral quintic hypersurface in $\mathbb{p}^3$, and use the petri map toproduce components of expected dimension.
