algebraic surfaces of general type with $q=0$, $p_g=2$ and $k^2=1$ weredescribed by enriques and then studied in more detail by horikawa. in thispaper we consider a $16$-dimensional family of special horikawa surfaces whichare certain bidouble covers of $\mathbb{p}^2$. the construction is motivated bythat of special kunev surfaces which are counterexamples for infinitesimaltorelli and generic global torelli problem. the main result of the paper is ageneric global torelli theorem for special horikawa surfaces. to prove thetheorem, we relate the periods of special horikawa surfaces to the periods ofcertain lattice polarized $k3$ surfaces using eigenperiod maps and then apply atorelli type result proved by laza.
