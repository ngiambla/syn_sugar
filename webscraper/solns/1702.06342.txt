  network support is a key success factor for talented people. as an example,
the hungarian talent support network involves close to 1500 talent points and
more than 200,000 people. this network started the hungarian templeton program
identifying and helping 315 exceptional cognitive talents. this network is a
part of the european talent support network initiated by the european council
for high ability involving more than 300 organizations in over 30 countries in
europe and extending in other continents. these networks are giving good
examples that talented people often occupy a central, but highly dynamic
position in social networks. the involvement of such 'creative nodes' in
network-related decision making processes is vital, especially in novel
environmental challenges. such adaptive/learning responses characterize a large
variety of complex systems from proteins, through brains to society. it is
crucial for talent support programs to use these networking and learning
processes to increase their efficiency further.
