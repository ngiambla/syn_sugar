we prove local well-posedness for the cauchy problem associated tokorteweg-de vries equation on a metric star graph with three semi-infinitebonds given by one negative half-line and two positives half-lines attached toa common vertex, for two classes of boundary conditions. the results areobtained in the low regularity setting by using the approach given bycolliander, kenig (2002) and holmer (2006).
