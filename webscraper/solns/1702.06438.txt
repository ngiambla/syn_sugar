an alternative proof is given of the existence of greatest lower bounds inthe imbalance order of binary maximal instantaneous codes of a given size.these codes are viewed as maximal antichains of a given size in the infinitebinary tree of 0-1 words. the proof proposed makes use of a single balancingoperation instead of expansion and contraction as in the original proof of theexistence of glb.
