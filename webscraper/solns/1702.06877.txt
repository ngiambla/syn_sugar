in recent years, bullying and aggression against users on social media havegrown significantly, causing serious consequences to victims of alldemographics. in particular, cyberbullying affects more than half of youngsocial media users worldwide, and has also led to teenage suicides, prompted byprolonged and/or coordinated digital harassment. nonetheless, tools andtechnologies for understanding and mitigating it are scarce and mostlyineffective. in this paper, we present a principled and scalable approach todetect bullying and aggressive behavior on twitter. we propose a robustmethodology for extracting text, user, and network-based attributes, studyingthe properties of cyberbullies and aggressors, and what features distinguishthem from regular users. we find that bully users post less, participate infewer online communities, and are less popular than normal users, whileaggressors are quite popular and tend to include more negativity in theirposts. we evaluate our methodology using a corpus of 1.6m tweets posted over 3months, and show that machine learning classification algorithms can accuratelydetect users exhibiting bullying and aggressive behavior, achieving over 90%auc.
