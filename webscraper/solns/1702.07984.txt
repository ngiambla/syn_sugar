  many societal decision problems lie in high-dimensional continuous spaces not
amenable to the voting techniques common for their discrete or
single-dimensional counterparts. these problems are typically discretized
before running an election or decided upon through negotiation by
representatives. we propose a meta-algorithm called iterative local voting for
collective decision-making in this setting, in which voters are sequentially
sampled and asked to modify a candidate solution within some local neighborhood
of its current value, as defined by a ball in some chosen norm. in general,
such schemes do not converge, or, when they do, the resulting solution does not
have a natural description.
  we first prove the convergence of this algorithm under appropriate choices of
neighborhoods to plausible solutions in certain natural settings: when the
voters' utilities can be expressed in terms of some form of distance from their
ideal solution, and when these utilities are additively decomposable across
dimensions. in many of these cases, we obtain convergence to the societal
welfare maximizing solution.
  we then describe an experiment in which we test our algorithm for the
decision of the u.s. federal budget on mechanical turk with over 4,000 workers,
employing neighborhoods defined by $\mathcal{l}^1, \mathcal{l}^2$ and
$\mathcal{l}^\infty$ balls. we make several observations that inform future
implementations of such a procedure.
