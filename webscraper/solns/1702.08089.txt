we investigate the quantum parameter estimation in circuit quantumelectrodynamics via dispersive measurement. based on the metropolis hastings(mh) algorithm and the markov chain monte carlo (mcmc) integration, a newalgorithm is proposed to calculate the fisher information by the stochasticmaster equation for unknown parameter estimation. here, the fisher informationis expressed in the form of log-likehood functions and further approximated bythe mcmc integration. numerical results demonstrate that the single evolutionof the fisher information can probably approach the quantum fisher information.the same phenomenon is observed in the ensemble evolution in the short timeinterval. these results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposedalgorithm.
