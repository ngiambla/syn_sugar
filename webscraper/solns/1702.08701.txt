this paper aims at refined error analysis for binary classification usingsupport vector machine (svm) with gaussian kernel and convex loss. our firstresult shows that for some loss functions such as the truncated quadratic lossand quadratic loss, svm with gaussian kernel can reach the almost optimallearning rate, provided the regression function is smooth. our second resultshows that, for a large number of loss functions, under some tsybakov noiseassumption, if the regression function is infinitely smooth, then svm withgaussian kernel can achieve the learning rate of order $m^{-1}$, where $m$ isthe number of samples.
