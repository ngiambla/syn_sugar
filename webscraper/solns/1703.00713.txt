we investigate dynamics of probe particles moving in the near-horizon limitof (2n+1)-dimensional extremal myers-perry black hole with arbitrary rotationparameters. we observe that in the most general case with nonequal nonvanishingrotational parameters the system admits separation of variables inn-dimensional ellipsoidal coordinates. this allows us to find solution of thecorresponding hamilton-jacobi equation and write down the explicit expressionsof liouville constants of motion.
