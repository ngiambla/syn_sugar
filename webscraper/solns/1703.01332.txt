minimax lower bounds are pessimistic in nature: for any given estimator,minimax lower bounds yield the existence of a worst-case target vector$\beta^*_{worst}$ for which the prediction error of the given estimator isbounded from below. however, minimax lower bounds shed no light on theprediction error of the given estimator for target vectors different than$\beta^*_{worst}$. a characterization of the prediction error of any convexregularized least-squares is given. this characterization provide both a lowerbound and an upper bound on the prediction error. this produces lower boundsthat are applicable for any target vector and not only for a single, worst-case$\beta^*_{worst}$. finally, these lower and upper bounds on the predictionerror are applied to the lasso is sparse linear regression. we obtain a lowerbound involving the compatibility constant for any tuning parameter, matchingupper and lower bounds for the universal choice of the tuning parameter, and alower bound for the lasso with small tuning parameter.
