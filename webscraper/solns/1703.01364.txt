although there is ample work in the literature dealing with skewness in themultivariate setting, there is a relative paucity of work in the matrix variateparadigm. such work is, for example, useful for modelling three-way data. amatrix variate skew-t distribution is derived based on a mean-variance matrixnormal mixture. an expectation-conditional maximization algorithm is developedfor parameter estimation. simulated data are used for illustration.
