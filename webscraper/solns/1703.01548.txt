coded caching scheme, which is an effective technique to increase thetransmission efficiency during peak traffic times, has recently become quitepopular among the coding community. generally rate can be measured to thetransmission in the peak traffic times, i.e., this efficiency increases withthe decreasing of rate. in order to implement a coded caching scheme, each filein the library must be split in a certain number of packets. and this numberdirectly reflects the complexity of a coded caching scheme, i.e., thecomplexity increases with the increasing of the packet number. however thereexists a tradeoff between the rate and packet number. so it is meaningful tocharacterize this tradeoff and design the related pareto-optimal coded cachingschemes with respect to both parameters.  recently, a new concept called placement delivery array (pda) was proposed tocharacterize the coded caching scheme. however as far as we know no one has yetproved that one of the previously known pdas is pareto-optimal. in this paper,we first derive two lower bounds on the rate under the framework of pda.consequently, the pda proposed by maddah-ali and niesen is pareto-optimal, anda tradeoff between rate and packet number is obtained for some parameters.then, from the above observations and the view point of combinatorial design,two new classes of pareto-optimal pdas are obtained. based on these pdas, theschemes with low rate and packet number are obtained. finally the performanceof some previously known pdas are estimated by comparing with these two classesof schemes.
