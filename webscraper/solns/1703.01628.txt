we study the adjoint of the double layer potential associated with thelaplacian (the adjoint of the neumann-poincar\'e operator), as a map on theboundary surface $\gamma$ of a domain in $\mathbb{r}^3$ with conical points.the spectrum of this operator directly reflects the well-posedness of relatedtransmission problems across $\gamma$. in particular, if the domain isunderstood as an inclusion with complex permittivity $\epsilon$, embedded in abackground medium with unit permittivity, then the polarizability tensor of thedomain is well-defined when $(\epsilon+1)/(\epsilon-1)$ belongs to theresolvent set in energy norm. we study surfaces $\gamma$ that have a finitenumber of conical points featuring rotational symmetry. on the energy space, weshow that the essential spectrum consists of an interval. on $l^2(\gamma)$,i.e. for square-integrable boundary data, we show that the essential spectrumconsists of a countable union of curves, outside of which the fredholm indexcan be computed as a winding number with respect to the essential spectrum. weprovide explicit formulas, depending on the opening angles of the conicalpoints. we reinforce our study with very precise numerical experiments,computing the energy space spectrum and the spectral measures of thepolarizability tensor in two different examples. our results indicate that thedensities of the spectral measures may approach zero extremely rapidly in thecontinuous part of the energy space spectrum.
