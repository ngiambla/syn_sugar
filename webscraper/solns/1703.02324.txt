the capacity region of a two-transmitter gaussian multiple access channel(mac) under average input power constraints is studied, when the receiveremploys a zero-threshold one-bit analog-to-digital converter (adc). it isproved that the input distributions of the two transmitters that achieve theboundary points of the capacity region are discrete. based on the position of aboundary point, upper bounds on the number of the mass points of thecorresponding distributions are derived.
