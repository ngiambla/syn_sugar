in this paper we expand the theory of weighted sheaves over posets, and useit to study the local homology of artin groups. first, we use such theory torelate the homology of classical braid groups with the homology of certainindependence complexes of graphs. then, in the context of discrete morse theoryon weighted sheaves, we introduce a particular class of acyclic matchings.explicit formulas for the homology of the corresponding morse complexes aregiven, in terms of the ranks of the associated incidence matrices. we use suchmethod to perform explicit computations for the new affine case $\tilde c_n$,as well as for the cases $a_n$, $b_n$ and $\tilde{a}_n$ (which were alreadydone before by different methods).
