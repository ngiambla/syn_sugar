in this paper, we first prove that the local time associated with symmetric$\alpha$-stable processes is of bounded $p$-variation for any$p>\frac{2}{\alpha-1}$ partly based on barlow's estimation of the modulus ofthe local time of such processes.\,\,the fact that the local time is of bounded$p$-variation for any $p>\frac{2}{\alpha-1}$ enables us to define the integralof the local time $\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\triangledown_-^{\alpha-1}f(x)d_xl_t^x$ as a young integral for less smooth functions being of bounded$q$-varition with $1\leq q<\frac{2}{3-\alpha}$. when $q\geq\frac{2}{3-\alpha}$, young's integration theory is no longer applicable.however, rough path theory is useful in this case. the main purpose of thispaper is to establish a rough path theory for the integration with respect tothe local times of symmetric $\alpha$-stable processes for$\frac{2}{3-\alpha}\leq q< 4$.
