we introduce seven families of stochastic systems of interacting particles inone-dimension corresponding to the seven families of irreducible reduced affineroot systems. we prove that they are determinantal in the sense that allspatio-temporal correlation functions are given by determinants controlled by asingle function called the spatio-temporal correlation kernel. for the fourfamilies ${a}_{n-1}$, ${b}_n$, ${c}_n$ and ${d}_n$, we identify the systems ofstochastic differential equations solved by these determinantal processes,which will be regarded as the elliptic extensions of the dyson model. here weuse the notion of martingales in probability theory and the ellipticdeterminant evaluations of the macdonald denominators of irreducible reducedaffine root systems given by rosengren and schlosser.
