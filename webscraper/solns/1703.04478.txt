  in this paper, the scientometric evaluation of faculty members of 50 greek
science and engineering university departments is presented. 1978 academics
were examined in total. the number of papers, citations, h-index and i10-index
have been collected for each academic, department, school and university using
google scholar and the citations analysis program publish or perish. analysis
of the collected data showed that departments of the same academic discipline
are characterized by significant differences on the scientific outcome. in
addition, in the majority of the evaluated departments a significant difference
in h-index between academics who report scientific activity on the departments
website and those who do not, was observed. moreover, academics who earned
their phd title in the usa demonstrate higher indices in comparison to scholars
who obtained their phd title in europe or in greece. finally, the correlation
between the academic rank and the scholars h-index (or the number of their
citations) is quite low in some departments, which, under specific
circumstances, could be an indication of the lack of meritocracy.
