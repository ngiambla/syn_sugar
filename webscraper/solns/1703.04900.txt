  there is an increasing interest in learning outside of the traditional
classroom setting. this is especially true for topics covering computational
tools and data science, as both are challenging to incorporate in the standard
curriculum. these atypical learning environments offer new opportunities for
teaching, particularly when it comes to combining conceptual knowledge with
hands-on experience/expertise with methods and skills. advances in cloud
computing and containerized environments provide an attractive opportunity to
improve the efficiency and ease with which students can learn. this manuscript
details recent advances towards using commonly-available cloud computing
services and advanced cyberinfrastructure support for improving the learning
experience in bootcamp-style events. we cover the benefits (and challenges) of
using a server hosted remotely instead of relying on student laptops, discuss
the technology that was used in order to make this possible, and give
suggestions for how others could implement and improve upon this model for
pedagogy and reproducibility.
