we introduce a certain differential graded bialgebra, neither commutative norcocommutative, that governs perturbations of a differential on complexessupplied with an abstract hodge decomposition. this leads to a conceptualtreatment of the homological perturbation lemma and its multiplicative version.as an application we give an explicit form of the decomposition theorem for$a_\infty$ algebras and $a_\infty$ modules and, more generally, for twistedobjects in differential graded categories.
