we provide a complete description of the low temperature wetting transitionfor the two dimensional solid-on-solid model. more precisely we study theinteger-valued field $(\phi(x))_{x\in \mathbb z^2}$, associated associated tothe energy functional $$v(\phi)=\beta \sum_{x\simy}|\phi(x)-\phi(y)|-\sum_{x}\left(h{\bf 1}_{\{\phi(x)=0\}}-\infty{\bf1}_{\{\phi(x)<0\}} \right).$$ it is known since the pioneering work of chalker(j. phys. a {\bf 15} (1982) 481-485) that for every $\beta$, there exists$h_{w}(\beta)>0$ delimiting a transition between a delocalized phase($h<h_{w}(\beta)$) where the proportion of points at level zero vanishes, and alocalized phase ($h>h_{w}(\beta)$) where this proportion is positive. we provein the present paper that for $\beta$ sufficiently large we have $$h_w(\beta)=\log \left(\frac{e^{4\beta}}{e^{4\beta}-1}\right).$$ furthermore we provide asharp asymptotic for the free energy at the vicinity of the critical point: weshow that close to $h_w(\beta)$, the free energy is approximately piecewiseaffine and that the points of discontinuity for the derivative of the affineapproximation forms a geometric sequence accumulating on the right of$h_w(\beta)$. this asymptotic behavior provides a strong evidence for theconjectured existence of countably many "layering transitions" at the vicinityof the critical point, corresponding to jumps for the typical height of thefield.
