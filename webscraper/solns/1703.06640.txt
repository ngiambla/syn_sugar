in this paper, we study the dynamics of a non-autonomous dynamical system$(x,\mathbb{f})$ generated by a sequence $(f_n)$ of continuous self mapsconverging uniformly to $f$. we relate the dynamics of the non-autonomoussystem $(x,\mathbb{f})$ with the dynamics of $(x,f)$. we prove that if thefamily $\mathbb{f}$ commutes with $f$ and $(f_n)$ converges to $f$ at a"sufficiently fast rate", many of the dynamical properties for the systems$(x,\mathbb{f})$ and $(x,f)$ coincide. in the procees we establish equivalenceof properties like equicontinuity, minimality and denseness of proximal pairs(cells) for the two systems. in addition, if $\mathbb{f}$ is feeble open, weestablish equivalence of properties like transitivity, weak mixing and variousforms of sensitivities. we prove that feeble openness of $\mathbb{f}$ issufficient to establish equivalence of topological mixing for the two systems.we prove that if $\mathbb{f}$ is feeble open, dynamics of the non-autonomoussystem on a compact interval exhibits any form of mixing if and only if $(x,f)$exhibits identical form of mixing. we also investigate dense periodicity forthe two systems. we give examples to investigate sufficiency/necessity of theconditions imposed. in the process we derive weaker conditions under which theestablished dynamical relation (between the two systems $(x,\mathbb{f})$ and$(x,f)$) is preserved.
