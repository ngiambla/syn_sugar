we describe an algorithm computing the monodromy and the pole orderfiltration on the top milnor fiber cohomology of hypersurfaces in$\mathbb{p}^n$ whose pole order spectral sequence degenerates at the secondpage. in the case of hyperplane arrangements and free, locallyquasi-homogeneous hypersurfaces, and assuming a key conjecture, this algorithmis much faster than for a hypersurface as above. our conjecture is supported bythe results due to l. narv\' ez macarro and m. saito on the roots ofbernstein-sato polynomials of such hypersurfaces, by all the examples computedso far, and by one partial result. for hyperplane arrangements coming fromreflection groups, a surprising symmetry of their pole order spectra on topcohomology is displayed in our examples. we also improve our previous resultsin the case of plane curves.
