let $f: s\longrightarrow b$ be a non-trivial fibration from a complexprojective smooth surface $s$ to a smooth curve $b$ of genus $b$. let $c_f$ theclifford index of the generic fibre $f$ of $f$. in [arxiv:1401.7502v4] it isproved that the relative irregularity of $f$, $q_f=h^{1,0}(s)-b$ is less thanor equal to $g(f)-c_f$. in particular this proves the (modified) xiao'sconjecture: $q_f\le 1+g(f)/2$ for fibrations of general clifford index. in thisshort note we assume that the generic fiber of $f$ is a plane curve of degree$d\ge 5$ and we prove that $q_f\le g(f)-c_f-1$. in particular we obtain theconjecture for families of quintic plane curves. this theorem is implied forthe following result on infinitesimal deformations: let $f$ a smooth planecurve of degree $d\ge 5$ and let $\xi$ be an infinitesimal deformation of $f$preserving the planarity of the curve. then the rank of the cup-product map$\cdot \xi: h^0(f,\omega_f) \rightarrow h^1(f,o_f)$ is at least $d-3$. we alsoshow that this bound is sharp.
