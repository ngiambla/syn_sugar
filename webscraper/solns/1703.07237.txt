we show that if $x$ is an abelian variety of dimension $g \geq 1$ and${\mathcal e}$ is an m-regular coherent sheaf on $x$, the castelnuovo-mumfordregularity of ${\mathcal e}$ with respect to an ample and globally generatedline bundle ${\mathcal o}(1)$ on $x$ is at most $g$, and that equality isobtained when ${\mathcal e}^{\vee}(1)$ is continuously globally generated. asan application, we give a numerical characterization of ample semihomogeneousvector bundles for which this bound is attained.
