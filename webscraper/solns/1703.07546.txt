this paper presents a systematic approach for computing local solutions tomotion planning problems in non-convex environments using numerical optimalcontrol techniques. it extends the range of use of state-of-the-art numericaloptimal control tools to problem classes where these tools have previously notbeen applicable. today these problems are typically solved using motionplanners based on randomized or graph search. the general principle is todefine a homotopy that perturbs, or preferably relaxes, the original problem toan easily solved problem. by combining a sequential quadratic programming (sqp)method with a homotopy approach that gradually transforms the problem from arelaxed one to the original one, practically relevant locally optimal solutionsto the motion planning problem can be computed. the approach is demonstrated inmotion planning problems in challenging 2d and 3d environments, where thepresented method significantly outperforms a state-of-the-art open-sourceoptimizing sampled-based planner commonly used as benchmark.
