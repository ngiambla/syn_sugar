in a recent paper [arxiv:1612.04918] there are new results concerning thepolytopic set of possible states of a linear discrete-time siso system subjectto bounded disturbances from measurements corrupted by bounded noise. usingthese results we construct an algorithm which, for the special case of a plantwith a lag, recursively updates these polytopic sets when new measurementsarrive.
