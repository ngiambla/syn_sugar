we give a moment map interpretation of some relatively balanced metrics. asan application, we extend a result of s. k. donaldson on constant scalarcurvature k\"ahler metrics to the case of extremal metrics. namely, we showthat a given extremal metric is the limit of some specific relatively balancedmetrics. as a corollary, we recover uniqueness and splitting results forextremal metrics in the polarized case.
