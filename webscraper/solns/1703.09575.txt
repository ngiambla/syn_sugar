in this paper, we propose a framework for cross-layer optimization to ensureultra-high reliability and ultra-low latency in radio access networks, whereboth transmission delay and queueing delay are considered. with shorttransmission time, the blocklength of channel codes is finite, and the shannoncapacity cannot be used to characterize the maximal achievable rate with giventransmission error probability. with randomly arrived packets, some packets mayviolate the queueing delay. moreover, since the queueing delay is shorter thanthe channel coherence time in typical scenarios, the required transmit power toguarantee the queueing delay and transmission error probability will becomeunbounded even with spatial diversity. to ensure the requiredquality-of-service (qos) with finite transmit power, a proactive packetdropping mechanism is introduced. then, the overall packet loss probabilityincludes transmission error probability, queueing delay violation probability,and packet dropping probability. we optimize the packet dropping policy, powerallocation policy, and bandwidth allocation policy to minimize the transmitpower under the qos constraint. the optimal solution is obtained, which dependson both channel and queue state information. simulation and numerical resultsvalidate our analysis, and show that setting packet loss probabilities equal isa near optimal solution.
