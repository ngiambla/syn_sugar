we consider the incompressible euler and navier-stokes equations in athree-dimensional moving thin domain. under the assumption that the moving thindomain degenerates into a two-dimensional moving closed surface as the width ofthe thin domain goes to zero, we give a heuristic derivation of singular limitequations on the degenerate moving surface of the euler and navier-stokesequations in the moving thin domain and investigate relations between theirenergy structures. we also compare the limit equations with the euler andnavier-stokes equations on a stationary manifold, which are described in termsof the levi-civita connection.
