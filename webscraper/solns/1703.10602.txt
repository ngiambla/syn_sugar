let $g$ be a finite group and $p$ be a prime. we investigate isomorphisminvariants of $\mathbb{z}_{(p)}[g]$-lattices called regulator constants, whichwere originally introduced by dokchitser--dokchitser in the context of ellipticcurves. regulator constants canonically yield a pairing between the space ofbrauer relations for $g$ and its representation ring. for all $g$, we show thatthis pairing is never identically zero. for formal reasons, in general thepairing has non-trivial kernel. but, if $g$ has cyclic sylow $p$-subgroup andwe restrict to considering permutation lattices, then we show that the pairingis non-degenerate modulo the formal kernel. using this we can show that, forcertain groups, including dihedral groups of order $2p$ for $p$ odd, theisomorphism class of any $\mathbb{z}_{(p)}[g]$-lattice is determined by itsregulator constants, its extension of scalars to $\mathbb{q}$, and acohomological invariant of yakovlev.
