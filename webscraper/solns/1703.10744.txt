time-triggered and event-triggered control strategies for stabilization of anunstable plant over a rate-limited communication channel subject to unknown,bounded delay are studied and compared. event triggering carries implicitinformation, revealing the state of the plant. however, the delay in thecommunication channel causes information loss, as it makes the stateinformation out of date. there is a critical delay value, when the loss ofinformation due to the communication delay perfectly compensates the implicitinformation carried by the triggering events. this occurs when the maximumdelay equals the inverse of the entropy rate of the plant. in this context,extensions of our previous results for event triggering strategies arepresented for vector systems and are compared with the data-rate theorem fortime-triggered control, that is extended here to a setting with unknown delay.
