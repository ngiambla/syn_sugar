a trajectory isomorphism between the two newtonian fixed center problem inthe sphere and two associated planar two fixed center problems is constructedby performing two simultaneous gnomonic projections in $s^2$. this isomorphismconverts the original quadratures into elliptic integrals and allows thebifurcation diagram of the spherical problem to be analyzed in terms of thecorresponding ones of the planar systems. the dynamics along the orbits in thedifferent regimes for the problem in $s^2$ is expressed in terms of jacobielliptic functions.
