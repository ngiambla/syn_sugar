berge's maximum theorem gives conditions ensuring the continuity of anoptimised function as a parameter changes. in this paper we state and prove themaximum theorem in terms of the theory of monoidal topology and the theory ofdouble categories.  this approach allows us to generalise (the main assertion of) the maximumtheorem, which is classically stated for topological spaces, topseudotopological spaces and pretopological spaces, as well as to closurespaces, approach spaces and probabilistic approach spaces, amongst others. as apart of this we prove a generalisation of the extreme value theorem.
