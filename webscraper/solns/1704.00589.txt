we show that $a_s(n)$, the coordinate algebra of wang's quantum permutationgroup, is calabi-yau of dimension $3$ when $n\geq 4$, and compute itshochschild cohomology with trivial coefficients. we also show that, for alarger class of quantum permutation algebras, including those representingquantum symmetry groups of finite graphs, the second hochschild cohomologygroup with trivial coefficients vanishes, and hence these algebras have the acproperty considered in quantum probability: all cocycles can be completed to asch\"urmann triple.
