in this paper we study a non strictly systems of conservation law bystochastic perturbation. we show the existence and uniqueness of the solution.we do not assume that $bv$-regularity for the initial conditions. the proofsare based on the concept of entropy solution and in the characteristics method(in the influence of noise). this is the first result on the regularization bynoise in hyperbolic systems of conservation law.
