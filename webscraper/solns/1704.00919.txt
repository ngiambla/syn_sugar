we usually think of 2-dimensional manifolds as surfaces embedded in euclidean3-space. since humans cannot visualise euclidean spaces of higher dimensions,it appears to be impossible to give pictorial representations ofhigher-dimensional manifolds. however, one can in fact encode the topology of asurface in a 1-dimensional picture. by analogy, one can draw 2-dimensionalpictures of 3-manifolds (heegaard diagrams), and 3-dimensional pictures of4-manifolds (kirby diagrams). with the help of open books one can likewiserepresent at least some 5-manifolds by 3-dimensional diagrams, and contactgeometry can be used to reduce these to drawings in the 2-plane.  in this paper, i shall explain how to draw such pictures and how to use themfor answering topological and geometric questions. the work on 5-manifolds isjoint with fan ding and otto van koert.
