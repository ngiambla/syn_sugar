we study the statistics of the kinetic (or equivalently potential) energy for$n$ non-interacting fermions in a $1d$ harmonic trap of frequency $\omega$, atfinite temperature $t$. remarkably, we find an exact solution for the fulldistribution of the kinetic energy, at any temperature $t$ and for any $n$,using a non-trivial mapping to an integrable calogero-moser-sutherland model.as a function of temperature $t$, and for large $n$, we identify: (i) a quantumregime, for $t \sim \hbar \omega$, where quantum fluctuations dominate and (ii)a thermal regime, for $t \sim n \hbar \omega$, governed by thermalfluctuations. we show how the mean, the variance as well as the large deviationfunction associated with the distribution of the kinetic energy cross over fromthe quantum to the thermal regime as temperature increases.
