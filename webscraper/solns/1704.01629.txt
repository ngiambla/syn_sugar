given an affine rational complexity-one $t$-variety $x$, we construct anexplicit embedding of $x$ in affine space $\mathbb{a}^n$. we show that thisembedding is well-poised, that is, every initial ideal of $i_x$ is a primeideal, and determine the tropicalization of $x$. we then study valuations ofthe coordinate ring $r_x$ of $x$ which respect the torus action, showing thatfor full rank valuations, the natural generators of $r_x$ form a khovanskiibasis. this allows us to determine newton-okounkov bodies of rationalprojective complexity-one $t$-varieties, partially recovering (andgeneralizing) results of petersen. we apply our results to describe allirreducible special fibers of $\mathbb{k}^*\times t$-equivariant degenerationsof rational projective complexity-one $t$-varieties, generalizing a results ofs\"u\ss{} and the first author.
