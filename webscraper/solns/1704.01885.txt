this paper is concerned with the intrinsic geometric structure of interiortransmission eigenfunctions arising in wave scattering theory. we numericallyshow that the aforementioned geometric structure can be much delicate andintriguing. the major findings can be roughly summarized as follows. if thereis a cusp on the support of the underlying potential function, then theinterior transmission eigenfunction vanishes near the cusp if its interiorangle is less than $\pi$, whereas the interior transmission eigenfunctionlocalizes near the cusp if its interior angle is bigger than $\pi$.furthermore, we show that the vanishing and blowup orders are inverselyproportional to the interior angle of the cusp: the sharper the angle, thehigher the convergence order. our results are first of its type in the spectraltheory for transmission eigenvalue problems, and the existing studies in theliterature concentrate more on the intrinsic properties of the transmissioneigenvalues instead of the transmission eigenfunctions. due to the limitednessof the computing resources, our study is by no means exclusive and complete. weconsider our study only in a certain geometric setup including corner, curvedcorner and edge singularities. nevertheless, we believe that similar resultshold for more general cusp singularities and rigorous theoreticaljustifications are much desirable. our study enriches the spectral theory fortransmission eigenvalue problems. we also discuss its implication to inversescattering theory.
