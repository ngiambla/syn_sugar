conjugate points play an important role in the proofs of the singularitytheorems of hawking and penrose. we examine the relation between singularitiesand conjugate points in flrw spacetimes with a singularity. in particular weprove a theorem that when a non-comoving, non-spacelike geodesic in a singularflrw spacetime obeys conditions (39) and (40), every point on that geodesic ispart of a pair of conjugate points. the proof is based on the raychaudhuriequation. we find that the theorem is applicable to all non-comoving,non-spacelike geodesics in flrw spacetimes with non-negative spatial curvatureand scale factors that near the singularity have power law behavior or powerlaw behavior times a logarithm. when the spatial curvature is negative, thetheorem is applicable to a subset of these spacetimes.
