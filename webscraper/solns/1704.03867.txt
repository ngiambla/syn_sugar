information system (is) security threats is still a major concern for manyorganisations. however, most organisations fall short in achieving a successfuladoption and implementation of is security measures. in this paper, wedeveloped a theoretical model for the adoption process of is securityinnovations in organisations. the model was derived by combining fourtheoretical models of innovation adoption, namely: diffusion of innovationtheory (doi), the technology acceptance model (tam), the theory of plannedbehaviour (tpb) and the technology-organisation-environment (toe) framework.the model depicts is security innovation adoption in organisations, as twodecision proceedings. the adoption process from the initiation stage until theacquisition of innovation is considered as a decision made by organisationwhile the process of innovation assimilation is assumed as a result of the useracceptance of innovation within the organisation. in addition, the modeldescribes the is security adoption process progressing in three sequentialstages, i.e. pre-adoption, adoption- decision and post-adoption phases. themodel also introduces several factors that influence the different stages of issecurity innovation adoption process. this study contributes to is securityliterature by proposing an overall model of is security adoption that includesorganisational adoption and user acceptance of innovation in a singleillustration. also, is security adoption model proposed in this study providesimportant practical implications for research and practice.
