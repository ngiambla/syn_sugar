we derive an ito stochastic differential equation for entropy production innonequilibrium langevin processes. introducing a random-time transformation,entropy production obeys a one-dimensional drift-diffusion equation,independent of the underlying physical model. this transformation allows us toidentify generic properties of entropy production. it also leads to an exactuncertainty equality relating the fano factor of entropy production and thefano factor of the random time, which we also generalize to non steady-stateconditions.
