we study a stochastic particle system with a logarithmically-singularinter-particle interaction potential which allows for inelastic particlecollisions. we relate the squared bessel process to the evolution of localizedclusters of particles, and develop a numerical method capable of detectingcollisions of many point particles without the use of pairwise computations, orvery refined adaptive timestepping. we show that when the system is in anappropriate parameter regime, the hydrodynamic limit of the empirical massdensity of the system is a solution to a nonlinear fokker-planck equation, suchas the patlak-keller-segel (pks) model, or its multispecies variant. we thenshow that the presented numerical method is well-suited for the simulation ofthe formation of finite-time singularities in the pks, as well as pks pre- andpost-blow-up dynamics. additionally, we present numerical evidence that blow-upwith an increasing total second moment in the two species keller-segel systemoccurs with a linearly increasing second moment in one component, and alinearly decreasing second moment in the other component.
