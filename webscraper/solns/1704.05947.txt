this paper considers the problem of fault detection and isolation (fdi) forswitched affine models. we first study the model invalidation problem and itsapplication to guaranteed fault detection. novel and intuitiveoptimization-based formulations are proposed for model invalidation andt-distinguishability problems, which we demonstrate to be computationally moreefficient than an earlier formulation that required a complicated change ofvariables. moreover, we introduce a distinguishability index as a measure ofseparation between the system and fault models, which offers a practical methodfor finding the smallest receding time horizon that is required for faultdetection, and for finding potential design recommendations for ensuringt-distinguishability. then, we extend our fault detection guarantees to theproblem of fault isolation with multiple fault models, i.e., the identificationof the type and location of faults, by introducing the concept ofi-isolability. an efficient way to implement the fdi scheme is also proposed,whose run-time does not grow with the number of fault models that areconsidered. moreover, we derive bounds on detection and isolation delays andpresent an adaptive scheme for reducing isolation delays. finally, theeffectiveness of the proposed method is illustrated using several examples,including an hvac system model with multiple faults.
