we prove the quenched version of the central limit theorem for thedisplacement of a random walk in doubly stochastic random environment, underthe $h_{-1}$-condition, with slightly stronger, $l^{2+\varepsilon}$ (ratherthan $l^2$) integrability condition on the stream tensor. on the way we extendnash's moment bound to the non-reversible, divergence-free drift case.
