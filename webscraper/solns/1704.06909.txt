we obtain an exact result for the midpoint probability distribution function(pdf) of the stationary continuum directed polymer, when averaged over thedisorder. it is obtained by relating that pdf to the linear response of thestochastic burgers field to some perturbation. from the symmetries of thestochastic burgers equation we derive a fluctuation-dissipation relation sothat the pdf gets given by the stationary two space-time points correlationfunction of the burgers field. an analytical expression for the latter wasobtained by imamura and sasamoto [2013], thereby rendering our result explicit.in the large length limit that implies that the pdf is nothing but the scalingfunction $f_{{\rm kpz}}(y)$ introduced by pr\"ahofer and spohn [2004]. usingthe kpz-universality paradigm, we find that this function can therefore also beinterpreted as the pdf of the position y of the maximum of the airy processminus a parabola and a two-sided brownian motion. we provide a direct numericaltest of the result through simulations of the log-gamma polymer.
