the tie-line scheduling problem in a multi-area power system seeks tooptimize tie-line power flows across areas that are independently operated bydifferent system operators (sos). in this paper, we leverage the theory ofmulti-parametric linear programming to propose algorithms for optimal tie-linescheduling within a deterministic and a robust optimization framework. througha coordinator, the proposed algorithms are proved to converge to the optimalschedule within a finite number of iterations. a key feature of the proposedalgorithms, besides their finite step convergence, is the privacy of theinformation exchanges; the so in an area does not need to reveal its dispatchcost structure, network constraints, or the nature of the uncertainty set tothe coordinator. the performance of the algorithms is evaluated using severalpower system examples.
