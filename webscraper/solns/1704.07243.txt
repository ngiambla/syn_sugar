it is shown that there is an oscillating sequence of higher order which isnot orthogonal to the class of dynamical flow with topological entropy zero. wefurther establish that any oscillating sequence of order $d$ is orthogonal toany $d$-nilsequence arising from the skew product on the $d$-dimensional torus$\mathbb{t}^d$. the proof yields that any oscillating sequence of higher orderis orthogonal to any dynamical sequence arising from topological dynamicalsystems with quasi-discrete spectrum. however, we provide an example ofoscillating sequence of higher order with large gowers norms. we further obtaina new estimation of the average of m\"{o}bius function on the short interval byappealing to bourgain's double recurence argument.
