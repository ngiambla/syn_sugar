we prove that every compact k\"ahler threefold $x$ of kodaira dimension$\kappa = 0$ or $1$ has a $\mathbf{q}$-factorial bimeromorphic model $x'$ withat worst terminal singularities such that for each curve $c \subset x'$, thepair $(x',c)$ admits a locally trivial algebraic approximation such that therestriction of the deformation of $x'$ to some neighborhood of $c$ is a trivialdeformation. as an application, we prove that every compact k\"ahler threefoldwith $\kappa = 0$ or $1$ has an algebraic approximation.
