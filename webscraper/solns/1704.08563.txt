we describe geometrically and algebraically the set of unattainable pointsfor the rational hermite interpolation problem (i.e. those points where theproblem does not have a solution). we show that this set is a union ofequidimensional complete intersection varieties of odd codimension, the numberof them being equal to the minimum between the degrees of the numerator anddenominator of the problem. each of these equidimensional varieties can befurther decomposed as a union of as many rational (irreducible) varieties asinput data points. we exhibit algorithms and equations defining all theseobjects.
