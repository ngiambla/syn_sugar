traveling periodic waves of the modified korteweg-de vries (mkdv) equationare considered in the focusing case. by using one-fold and two-fold darbouxtransformations, we construct explicitly the rogue periodic waves of the mkdvequation expressed by the jacobian elliptic functions dn and cn respectively.the rogue dn-periodic wave describes propagation of an algebraically decayingsoliton over the dn-periodic wave, the latter wave is modulationally stablewith respect to long-wave perturbations. the rogue cn-periodic wave representsthe outcome of the modulation instability of the cn-periodic wave with respectto long-wave perturbations and serves for the same purpose as the rogue wave ofthe nonlinear schrodinger equation (nls), where it is expressed by the rationalfunction. we compute the magnification factor for the cn-periodic wave of themkdv equation and show that it remains the same as in the small-amplitude nlslimit for all amplitudes. as a by-product of our work, we find explicitexpressions for the periodic eigenfunctions of the akns spectral problemassociated with the dn- and cn-periodic waves of the mkdv equation.
