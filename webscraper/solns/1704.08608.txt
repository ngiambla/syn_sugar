we develop the theory of banach algebras whose multiplication (regarded as abilinear map) is open. we demonstrate that such algebras must have topologicalstable rank 1, however the latter condition is strictly weaker and implies onlythat products of non-empty open sets have non-empty interior. we theninvestigate openness of convolution in semigroup algebras resolving in thenegative a problem of whether convolution in $\ell_1(\mathbb{n}_0)$ is open. byappealing to ultraproduct techniques, we demonstrate that neither in$\ell_1(\mathbb{z})$ nor in $\ell_1(\mathbb q)$ convolution is uniformly open.the problem of openness of multiplication in banach algebras of boundedoperators on banach spaces and their calkin algebras is also discussed.
