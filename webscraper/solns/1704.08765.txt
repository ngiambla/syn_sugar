in competitive sports it is often very hard to quantify the performance. aplayer to score or overtake may depend on only millesimal of seconds ormillimeters. in racquet sports like tennis, table tennis and squash many eventswill occur in a short time duration, whose recording and analysis can helpreveal the differences in performance. in this paper we show that it ispossible to architect a framework that utilizes the characteristic soundpatterns to precisely classify the types of and localize the positions of theseevents. from these basic information the shot types and the ball speed alongthe trajectories can be estimated. comparing these estimates with the optimalspeed and target the precision of the shot can be defined. the detailed shotstatistics and precision information significantly enriches and improves dataavailable today. feeding them back to the players and the coaches facilitatesto describe playing performance objectively and to improve strategy skills. theframework is implemented, its hardware and software components are installedand tested in a squash court.
