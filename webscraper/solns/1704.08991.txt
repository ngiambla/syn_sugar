recommendation plays a key role in e-commerce and in the entertainmentindustry. we propose to consider successive recommendations to users under theform of graphs of recommendations. we give models for this representation.motivated by the growing interest for algorithmic transparency, we then proposea first application for those graphs, that is the potential detection ofintroduced recommendation bias by the service provider. this application relieson the analysis of the topology of the extracted graph for a given user; wepropose a notion of recommendation coherence with regards to the topologicalproximity of recommended items (under the measure of items' k-closestneighbors, reminding the "small-world" model by watts & stroggatz). we finallyillustrate this approach on a model and on youtube crawls, targeting theprediction of "recommended for you" links (i.e., biased or not by youtube).
