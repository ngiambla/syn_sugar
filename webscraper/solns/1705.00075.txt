an important topic in the design of efficient networks is the construction of$(d,k,+\epsilon )$-digraphs, i.e. $k$-geodetic digraphs with minimum out-degree$\geq d$ and order $m(d,k)+ \epsilon $, where $m(d,k)$ represents the moorebound for degree $d$ and diameter $k$ and $\epsilon > 0$ is the (small) excessof the digraph. previous work has shown that there are no $(2,k,+1)$-digraphsfor $k \geq 2$. in a separate paper, the present author has shown that any$(2,k,+2)$-digraph must be diregular for $k \geq 2$. in the present work, thisanalysis is completed by proving the nonexistence of diregular$(2,k,+2)$-digraphs for $k \geq 3$ and classifying diregular$(2,2,+2)$-digraphs up to isomorphism.
