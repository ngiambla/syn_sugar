given a permutation $\sigma = \sigma_1 \ldots \sigma_n$ in the symmetricgroup $s_n$, we say that $\sigma_i$ matches the marked mesh pattern$mmp(a,b,c,d)$ in $\sigma$ if there are at least $a$ points to the right of$\sigma_i$ in $\sigma$ which are greater than $\sigma_i$, at least $b$ pointsto left of $\sigma_i$ in $\sigma$ which are greater than $\sigma_i$, at least$c$ points to left of $\sigma_i$ in $\sigma$ which are smaller than $\sigma_i$,and at least at least $d$ points to right of $\sigma_i$ in $\sigma$ which aresmaller than $\sigma_i$.  kitaev, remmel, and tiefenbruck systematically studied the distribution ofthe number of matches of $mmp(a,b,c,d)$ in 132-avoiding permutations. theoperation of reverse and complement on permutations allow one to translatetheir results to find the distribution of the number of $mmp(a,b,c,d)$ matchesin 231-avoiding, 213-avoiding, and 312-avoiding permutations. in this paper, westudy the distribution of the number of matches of $mmp(a,b,c,d)$ in123-avoiding permutations. we provide explicit recurrence relations toenumerate our objects which can be used to give closed forms for the generatingfunctions associated with such distributions. in many cases, we providecombinatorial explanations of the coefficients that appear in our generatingfunctions.
