in this paper, we propose methods for computing the hilbert series ofmultigraded right modules over the free associative algebra. in particular, wecompute such series for noncommutative multigraded algebras. using results fromthe theory of regular languages, we provide conditions when the methods areeffective and hence the sum of the hilbert series is a rational function.moreover, a characterization of finite-dimensional algebras is obtained interms of the nilpotency of a key matrix involved in the computations. usingthis result, efficient variants of the methods are also developed for thecomputation of hilbert series of truncated infinite-dimensional algebras whose(non-truncated) hilbert series may not be rational functions. we consider someapplications of the computation of multigraded hilbert series to algebras thatare invariant under the action of the general linear group. in fact, in thiscase such series are symmetric functions which can be decomposed in terms ofschur functions. finally, we present an efficient and complete implementationof (standard) graded and multigraded hilbert series that has been developed inthe kernel of the computer algebra system singular. a large set of testsprovides a comprehensive experimentation for the proposed algorithms and theirimplementations.
