in this paper, we will provide a comparison between uniform and randomsampling for speech and music signals. there are various sampling and recoverymethods for audio signals. here, we only investigate uniform and random schemesfor sampling and basic low-pass filtering and iterative method with adaptivethresholding for recovery. the simulation results indicate that uniformsampling with cubic spline interpolation outperforms other sampling andrecovery methods.
