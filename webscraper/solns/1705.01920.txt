our infrastructure touches the day-to-day life of each of our fellowcitizens, and its capabilities, integrity and sustainability are crucial to theoverall competitiveness and prosperity of our country. unfortunately, thecurrent state of u.s. infrastructure is not good: the american society of civilengineers' latest report on america's infrastructure ranked it at a d+ -- inneed of $3.9 trillion in new investments. this dire situation constrains thegrowth of our economy, threatens our quality of life, and puts our globalleadership at risk. the asce report called out three actions that need to betaken to address our infrastructure problem: 1) investment and planning in thesystem; 2) bold leadership by elected officials at the local and federal state;and 3) planning sustainability and resiliency in our infrastructure.  while our immediate infrastructure needs are critical, it would beshortsighted to simply replicate more of what we have today. by doing so, wemiss the opportunity to create intelligent infrastructure that will provide thefoundation for increased safety and resilience, improved efficiencies and civicservices, and broader economic opportunities and job growth. indeed, ourchallenge is to proactively engage the declining, incumbent nationalinfrastructure system and not merely repair it, but to enhance it; to create aninternationally competitive cyber-physical system that provides an immediateopportunity for better services for citizens and that acts as a platform for a21st century, high-tech economy and beyond.
