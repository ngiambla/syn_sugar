the electric power grid is one of the largest and most complexinfrastructures ever built by mankind. modern civilization depends on it forindustry production, human mobility, and comfortable living. however, manycritical technologies such as the 60 hz transformers were developed at thebeginning of the 20th century and have changed very little since then.1 thetraditional unidirectional power from the generation to the customer throughthe transmission-distribution grid has also changed nominally, but it no longermeets the need of the 21st century market energy customers. on one hand, 128mus residential customers pay $15b/per month for their utility bill, yet theyhave no option to select their energy supplier. in a world of where manytraditional industries are transformed by digital internet technology (amazon,ebay, uber, airbnb), the traditional electric energy market is laggingsignificantly behind. a move towards a true digital grid is needed. such adigital grid requires a tight integration of the physical layer (energy andpower) with digital and cyber information to allow an open and real time marketakin to the world of e-commerce. another major factor that is pushing for thisradical transformation are the rapidly changing patterns in energy resourcesownership and load flow. driven by the decreasing cost in distributed solar,energy storage, electric vehicle, on site generation and microgrids, the highpenetration of distributed energy resource (der) is shifting challengessubstantially towards the edge of grid from the control point of view. theenvisioned digital grid must facilitate the open competition and openinnovation needed to accelerate of the adoption of new der technologies whilesatisfying challenges in grid stability, data explosion and cyber security.
