modern societies can be understood as the intersection of four interdependentsystems: (1) the natural environment of geography, climate and weather; (2) thebuilt environment of cities, engineered systems, and physical infrastructure;(3) the social environment of human populations, communities and socio-economicactivities; and (4) an information ecosystem that overlays the other threedomains and provides the means for understanding, interacting with, andmanaging the relationships between the natural, built, and human environments.  as the nation and its communities become more connected, networked andtechnologically sophisticated, new challenges and opportunities arise thatdemand a rethinking of current approaches to public safety and emergencymanagement. addressing the current and future challenges requires an equallysophisticated program of research, technology development, and strategicplanning. the design and integration of intelligent infrastructure-includingembedded sensors, the internet of things (iot), advanced wireless informationtechnologies, real-time data capture and analysis, and machine-learning-baseddecision support-holds the potential to greatly enhance public safety,emergency management, disaster recovery, and overall community resilience,while addressing new and emerging threats to public safety and security.ultimately, the objective of this program of research and development is tosave lives, reduce risk and disaster impacts, permit efficient use of materialand social resources, and protect quality of life and economic stability acrossentire regions.
