as of 2014, 54% of the earth's population resides in urban areas, and it issteadily increasing, expecting to reach 66% by 2050. urban areas range fromsmall cities with tens of thousands of people to megacities with greater than10 million people. roughly 12% of the global population today lives in 28megacities, and at least 40 are projected by 2030. at these scales, the urbaninfrastructure such as roads, buildings, and utility networks will cover areasas large as new england. this steady urbanization and the resulting expansionof infrastructure, combined with renewal of aging urban infrastructure,represent tens of trillion of dollars in new urban infrastructure investmentover the coming decades. these investments must balance factors includingimpact on clean air and water, energy and maintenance costs, and theproductivity and health of city dwellers. moreover, cost-effective managementand sustainability of these growing urban areas will be one of the mostcritical challenges to our society, motivating the concept of science- anddata-driven urban design, retrofit, and operation-that is, "smart cities".
