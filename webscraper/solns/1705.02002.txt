increasingly, smart computing devices, with powerful sensors and internetconnectivity, are being embedded into all new forms of infrastructure, fromhospitals to roads to factories. these devices are part of the internet ofthings (iot) and the economic value of their widespread deployment is estimatedto be trillions of dollars, with billions of devices deployed. consider theexample of "smart meters" for electricity utilities. because of clear economicbenefits, including a reduction in the cost of reading meters, more preciseinformation about outages and diagnostics, and increased benefits frompredicting and balancing electric loads, such meters are already being rolledout across north america. with residential solar collection, smart meters allowindividuals to sell power back to the grid providing economic incentives forconservation. similarly, smart water meters allow water conservation in adrought. such infrastructure upgrades are infrequent (with smart metersexpected to be in service for 20-30 years) but the benefits from the upgradejustify the significant cost. a long-term benefit of such upgrades is thatunforeseen savings might be realized in the future when new analytic techniquesare applied to the data that is collected. the same benefits accrue to anyinfrastructure that embeds increased sensing and actuation capabilities via iotdevices, including roads and traffic control, energy and water management inbuildings, and public health monitoring.
