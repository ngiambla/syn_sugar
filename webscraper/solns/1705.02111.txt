polar codes were recently chosen to protect the control channel informationin the next-generation mobile communication standard (5g) defined by the 3gpp.as a result, receivers will have to implement blind detection of polar codedframes in order to keep complexity, latency, and power consumption tractable.as a newly proposed class of block codes, the problem of polar-code blinddetection has received very little attention. in this work, we propose alow-complexity blind-detection algorithm for polar-encoded frames. we base thisalgorithm on a novel detection metric with update rules that leverage the apriori knowledge of the frozen-bit locations, exploiting the inherentstructures that these locations impose on a polar-encoded block of data. weshow that the proposed detection metric allows to clearly distinguishpolar-encoded frames from other types of data by considering the cumulativedistribution functions of the detection metric, and the receiver operatingcharacteristic. the presented results are tailored to the 5g standardizationeffort discussions, i.e., we consider a short low-rate polar code concatenatedwith a crc.
