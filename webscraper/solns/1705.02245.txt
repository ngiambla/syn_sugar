application of models to data is fraught. data-generating collaborators oftenonly have a very basic understanding of the complications of collating,processing and curating data. challenges include: poor data collectionpractices, missing values, inconvenient storage mechanisms, intellectualproperty, security and privacy. all these aspects obstruct the sharing andinterconnection of data, and the eventual interpretation of data throughmachine learning or other approaches. in project reporting, a major challengeis in encapsulating these problems and enabling goals to be built around theprocessing of data. project overruns can occur due to failure to account forthe amount of time required to curate and collate. but to understand thesefailures we need to have a common language for assessing the readiness of aparticular data set. this position paper proposes the use of data readinesslevels: it gives a rough outline of three stages of data preparedness andspeculates on how formalisation of these levels into a common language for datareadiness could facilitate project management.
