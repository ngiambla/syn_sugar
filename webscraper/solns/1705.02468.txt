based on the scale-splitting (scsp) iteration method presented by hezari etal. in (a new iterative method for solving a class of complex symmetric systemlinear of equations, numerical algorithms 73 (2016) 927-955), we present a newtwo-step iteration method, called tscsp, for solving the complex symmetricsystem of linear equations $(w+it)x=b$, where $w$ and $t$ are symmetricpositive definite and symmetric positive semidefinite matrices, respectively.it is shown that if the matrices $w$ and $t$ are symmetric positive definite,then the method is unconditionally convergent. the optimal value of theparameter, which minimizes the spectral radius of the iteration matrix is alsocomputed. numerical {comparisons} of the tscsp iteration method with the scsp,the mhss, the pmhss and the gsor methods are given to illustrate theeffectiveness of the method.
