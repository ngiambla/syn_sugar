the coadjoint representation of a connected algebraic group $q$ with liealgebra $\mathfrak q$ is a thrilling and fascinating object. symmetricinvariants of $\mathfrak q$ (= $\mathfrak q$-invariants in the symmetricalgebra $s(\mathfrak q)$) can be considered as a first approximation to theunderstanding of the coadjoint action $(q:\mathfrak q^*)$ and coadjoint orbits.in this article, we study a class of non-reductive lie algebras, where thedescription of the symmetric invariants is possible and the coadjointrepresentation has a number of nice invariant-theoretic properties. if $g$ is asemisimple group with lie algebra $\mathfrak g$ and $v$ is $g$-module, then wedefine $\mathfrak q$ to be the semi-direct product of $\mathfrak g$ and $v$.then we are interested in the case, where the generic isotropy group for the$g$-action on $v$ is reductive and commutative. it turns out that in this casesymmetric invariants of $\mathfrak q$ can be constructed via certain$g$-equivariant maps from $\mathfrak g$ to $v$ ("covariants").
