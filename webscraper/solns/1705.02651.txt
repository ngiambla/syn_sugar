let $\omega \subset \mathbb{r}^2$ be a bounded convex domain in the plane andconsider \begin{align*}  -\delta u &=1 \qquad \mbox{in}~\omega \\ u &= 0 \qquad \mbox{on}~\partial\omega. \end{align*} if $u$ assumes its maximum in $x_0 \in \omega$, then theeccentricity of level sets close to the maximum is determined by the hessian$d^2u(x_0)$. we prove that $d^2u(x_0)$ is negative definite and give aquantitative bound on the spectral gap $$ \lambda_{\max}\left(d^2u(x_0)\right)\leq - c_1\exp\left( -c_2\frac{diam(\omega)}{inrad(\omega)} \right)$$ foruniversal $c_1, c_2$ this is sharp up to constants. the proof is based on a newlower bound for fourier coefficients whose proof has a topological component:if $f:\mathbb{t} \rightarrow \mathbb{r}$ is continuous and has $n$ signchanges, then $$ \sum_{k=0}^{n/2}{ \left| \left\langle f, \sin{kx}\right\rangle \right| + \left| \left\langle f, \cos{kx} \right\rangle \right| }\gtrsim_n \frac{ | f\|^{n+1}_{l^1(\mathbb{t})}}{ \| f\|^{n}_{l^{\infty}(\mathbb{t})}}.$$ this statement immediately implies estimates onhigher derivatives of harmonic functions $u$ in the unit ball: if $u$ is veryflat in the origin, then the boundary function $u(\cos{t}, \sin{t}):\mathbb{t}\rightarrow \mathbb{r}$ has to have either large amplitude or many roots. italso implies that the solution of the heat equation starting with $f:\mathbb{t}\rightarrow \mathbb{r}$ cannot decay faster than $\sim\exp(-(\# \mbox{signchanges})^2 t/4)$.
