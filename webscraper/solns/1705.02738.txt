single-radio-frequency (rf) multiple-input-multiple-output (mimo) systemssuch as the spatial modulation (sm) system and the space shift keying (ssk)system have been proposed to pursue a high spectral efficiency while keeping alow cost and complexity transceiver design. currently, polarization domainresource has been introduced to the single-rf mimo system to reduce the size ofthe transmit antenna array and provide 1 bit per channel use (bpcu)multiplexing gain. nevertheless, the polarization domain resource still has thepotential to provide a higher multiplexing gain in the polarized single-rf mimosystem. in this paper, we propose a generalized polarization shift keying(polarsk) modulation scheme for a simo system that uses the polarization statesin the dual-polarized transmit antenna as an information-bearing unit toincrease the overall spectral efficiency. at the receive end, the maximumlikelihood (ml) detector is employed to demodulate the received signal. aclosed form union upper bound on the average bit error probability (abep) ofpolarsk system with the optimum maximum likelihood (ml) receiver is deducedunder fading channels. to reduce the computational complexity of the receiver,a linear successive interference cancellation (sic) detection algorithm and asphere-decoding (sd) detection algorithm are proposed. on the basis of analyticresults and simulations, performances of the proposed polarsk systems in termsof computational complexity and abep are analyzed. numerical results show thatthe proposed polarsk scheme performs better than state of the artdual-polarized/uni-polarized sm schemes.
