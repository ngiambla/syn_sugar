we provide a model-free pricing-hedging duality in continuous time. for africtionless market consisting of $d$ risky assets with continuous pricetrajectories, we show that the purely analytic problem of finding the minimalsuperhedging price of an upper semicontinuous path dependent european optionhas the same value as the purely probabilistic problem of finding the supremumof the expectations of the option over all martingale measures. thesuperhedging problem is formulated with simple trading strategies andsuperhedging is required in the pathwise sense on a $\sigma$-compact samplespace of price trajectories. if the sample space is stable under stopping, theprobabilistic problem reduces to finding the supremum over all martingalemeasures with compact support. as an application of the general results wededuce dualities for vovk's outer measure and semi-static superhedging withfinitely many securities.
