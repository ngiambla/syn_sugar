we propose a novel system which can transform a recipe into any selectedregional style (e.g., japanese, mediterranean, or italian). this system hasthree characteristics. first the system can identify the degree of dietarystyle mixture of any selected recipe. second, the system can visualize suchdietary style mixtures using barycentric newton diagrams. third, the system cansuggest ingredient substitutions through an extended word2vec model, such thata recipe becomes more authentic for any selected dietary style. drawing on alarge number of recipes from yummly, an example shows how the proposed systemcan transform a traditional japanese recipe, sukiyaki, into french style.
