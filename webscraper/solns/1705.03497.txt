p2p lending presents as an innovative and flexible alternative forconventional lending institutions like banks, where lenders and borrowersdirectly make transactions and benefit each other without complicatedverifications. however, due to lack of specialized laws, delegated monitoringand effective managements, p2p platforms may spawn potential risks, such aswithdraw failures, investigation involvements and even runaway bosses, whichcause great losses to lenders and are especially serious and notorious inchina. although there are abundant public information and data available on theinternet related to p2p platforms, challenges of multi-sourcing andheterogeneity matter. in this paper, we promote a novel deep learning model,omnirank, which comprehends multi-dimensional features of p2p platforms forrisk quantification and produces scores for ranking. we first construct alarge-scale flexible crawling framework and obtain great amounts ofmulti-source heterogeneous data of domestic p2p platforms since 2007 from theinternet. purifications like duplication and noise removal, null handing,format unification and fusion are applied to improve data qualities. then weextract deep features of p2p platforms via text comprehension, topic modeling,knowledge graph and sentiment analysis, which are delivered as inputs toomnirank, a deep learning model for risk quantification of p2p platforms.finally, according to rankings generated by omnirank, we conduct flourish datavisualizations and interactions, providing lenders with comprehensiveinformation supports, decision suggestions and safety guarantees.
