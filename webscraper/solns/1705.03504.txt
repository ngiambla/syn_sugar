the maintenance of big cities public transport service quality requiresconstant monitoring, which may become an expensive and time-consuming practice.the perception of quality, from the users point of view is an important aspectof quality monitoring. in this sense, we proposed a methodology for dataanalysis and visualization, supported by software, which allows for thestructuring of estimates and assumptions of where and who seems to be havingunsatisfactory experiences while making use of the public transportation inpopulous metropolitan areas. moreover, it provides support in setting up a planfor on-site quality surveys. the proposed methodology increases the likelihoodthat, with the on-site visits, the interviewer finds users who sufferinconveniences, which influence their behavior. simulation comparison and asmall-scale pilot survey stand for the validity of the proposed method.
