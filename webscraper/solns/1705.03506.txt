in this paper we describe a simulation platform that supports studies on theimpact of crime on urban mobility. we present an example of how this can beachieved by seeking to understand the effect, on the transport system, if usersof this system decide to choose optimal routes of time between origins anddestinations that normally follow. based on real data from a large brazilianmetropolis, we found that the percentage of users who follow this policy issmall. most prefer to follow less efficient routes by making bus exchanges atterminals. this can be understood as an indication that the users of thetransport system privilege the security factor.
