every day, millions of users reveal their interests on facebook, which arethen monetized via targeted advertisement marketing campaigns. in this paper,we explore the use of demographically rich facebook ads audience estimates fortracking non-communicable diseases around the world. across 47 countries, wecompute the audiences of marker interests, and evaluate their potential intracking health conditions associated with tobacco use, obesity, and diabetes,compared to the performance of placebo interests. despite its huge potential,we find that, for modeling prevalence of health conditions across countries,differences in these interest audiences are only weakly indicative of thecorresponding prevalence rates. within the countries, however, our approachprovides interesting insights on trends of health awareness across demographicgroups. finally, we provide a temporal error analysis to expose the potentialpitfalls of using facebook's marketing api as a black box.
