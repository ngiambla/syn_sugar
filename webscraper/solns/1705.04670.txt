manet is a collection of mobile nodes operated by battery source with limitedenergy reservoir. the dynamic topology and absence of pre-existinginfrastructure in manet makes routing technique more thought-provoking. thearbitrary movement of nodes may lead towards more packet drop, routing overheadand end-to-end delay. moreover power deficiency in nodes affects the packetforwarding ability and thus reduces network lifetime. so a power aware stablerouting strategy is in demand in manet. in this manuscript we have proposed anovel multipath routing strategy that could select multiple stable routesbetween source and destination during data transmission depending on twofactors residual energy and link expiration time (let) of nodes. our proposedenergy aware stable multipath routing strategy could attain the reliability,load balancing, and bandwidth aggregation in order to increase the networklifetime.
