let $r$ be a polynomial ring over a field $k$ with irrelevant ideal $\frak m$and dimension $d$. let $i$ be a homogeneous ideal in $r$. we study theasymptotic behavior of the length of the modules $h^{i}_{\frak m}(r/i^n)$ for$n\gg 0$. we show that for a fixed number $\alpha \in \mathbb z$,$\limsup_{n\rightarrow \infty}\frac{\lambda(h^{i}_{\frak m}(r/i^n)_{\geq-\alpha n})}{n^d}<\infty.$ combining this with recent strong vanishing resultsgives that $\limsup_{n\rightarrow \infty}\frac{\lambda(h^{i}_{\frakm}{r/i^n})}{n^d}<\infty$ in many situations. we also establish that the actuallimit exists and is rational for certain classes of monomial ideals $i$ suchthat the lengths of local cohomology of $i^n$ are eventually finite. our proofsuse gr\"obner deformation and presburger arithmetic. finally, we utilize moretraditional commutative algebra techniques to show that $\liminf_{n\rightarrow\infty}\frac{\lambda(h^{i}_{\frak m}(r/i^n))}{n^d}>0$ when $r/i$ has "nice"singularities in both zero and positive characteristics.
