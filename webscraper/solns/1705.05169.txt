we study generalized eigenvalue problems for meet and join matrices withrespect to incidence functions on semilattices. we provide new bounds forgeneralized eigenvalues of meet matrices with respect to join matrices undervery general assumptions. the applied methodology is flexible, and it is shownin the case of gcd and lcm matrices that even sharper bounds can be obtained byapplying the known properties of the divisor lattice. these results can also beeasily modified for the dual problem of eigenvalues of join matrices withrespect to meet matrices, which we briefly consider as well. we investigate theeffectiveness of the obtained bounds for select examples involvingnumber-theoretical lattices.
