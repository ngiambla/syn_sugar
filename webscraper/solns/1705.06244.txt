in the $r$-spread out, $d$-dimensional voter model, each site $x$ of$\mathbb{z}^d$ has state (or 'opinion') 0 or 1 and, with rate 1, updates itsopinion by copying that of some site $y$ chosen uniformly at random among allsites within distance $r$ from $x$. if $d \geq 3$, the set of (extremal)stationary measures of this model is given by a family $\mu_{\alpha, r}$, where$\alpha \in [0,1]$. configurations sampled from this measure are polynomiallycorrelated fields of 0's and 1's in which the density of 1's is $\alpha$ andthe correlation weakens as $r$ becomes larger. we study these configurationsfrom the point of view of nearest neighbor site percolation on $\mathbb{z}^d$,focusing on asymptotics as $r \to \infty$. in \cite{rv15}, we have shown that,if $r$ is large, there is a critical value $\alpha_c(r)$ such that there ispercolation if $\alpha > \alpha_c(r)$ and no percolation if $\alpha <\alpha_c(r)$. here we prove that, as $r \to \infty$, $\alpha_c(r)$ converges tothe critical probability for bernoulli site percolation on $\mathbb{z}^d$. ourproof relies on a new upper bound on the joint occurrence of events under$\mu_{\alpha,r}$ which is of independent interest.
