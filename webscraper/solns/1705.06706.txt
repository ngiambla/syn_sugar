a system of stochastic differential equations is formulated describing theheat and salt content of a two-box ocean. variability in the heat and saltcontent and in the thermohaline circulation between the boxes is driven by fastgaussian atmospheric forcing and by ocean-intrinsic, eddy-driven variability.the eddy forcing of the slow dynamics takes the form of a colored, non-gaussiannoise. the qualitative effects of this non-gaussianity are investigated bycomparing to two approximate models: one that includes only the mean eddyeffects (the `averaged model'), and one that includes an additional gaussianwhite-noise approximation of the eddy effects (the `gaussian model'). both ofthese approximate models are derived using the methods of fast averaging andhomogenization.  in the parameter regime where the dynamics has a single stable equilibriumthe averaged model has too little variability. the gaussian model has accuratesecond-order statistics, but incorrect skew and rare-event probabilities. inthe parameter regime where the dynamics has two stable equilibria the eddynoise is much smaller than the atmospheric noise. the averaged, gaussian, andnon-gaussian models all have similar stationary distributions, but the jumprates between equilibria are too small for the averaged and gaussian models.
