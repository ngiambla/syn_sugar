although the amount of knowledge that the humans possess has been graduallyincreasing, we still do not know the procedure and conditions that lead to thecreation of new knowledge. an understanding of the modus operandi for thecreation of knowledge may help in accelerating the existing pace of buildingknowledge. our state of ignorance regarding various aspects of the process ofknowledge building is highlighted by the existing literature in the domain. thereason behind it has been our inability to acquire the underlying data of thiscomplex process. however, current time shows great promise of improvements inthe knowledge building domain due to the availability of several onlineknowledge building portals. in this report, we emphasise that these portals actas prototypes for universal knowledge building process. the analysis of bigdata availed from these portals may equip the knowledge building researcherswith the much needed meta-knowledge.
