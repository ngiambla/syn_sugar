we construct a compact, convex ancient solution of mean curvature flow in$\mathbb r^{n+1}$ with $o(1)\times o(n)$ symmetry that lies in a slab of width$\pi$. we provide detailed asymptotics for this solution and show that, up torigid motions, it is the only compact, convex, $o(n)$-invariant ancientsolution that lies in a slab of width $\pi$ and in no smaller slab.
