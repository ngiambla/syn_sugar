the manner in which aircraft communications, addressing and reporting system(acars) is being used has significantly changed over time. whilst originallyused by commercial airliners to track their flights and provide automatedtimekeeping on crew, today it serves as a multi-purpose air-ground data linkfor many aviation stakeholders including private jet owners, state actors andmilitary. since acars messages are still mostly sent in the clear over awireless channel, any sensitive information sent with acars can potentiallylead to a privacy breach for users. naturally, different stakeholders considerdifferent types of data sensitive. in this paper we propose a privacy frameworkmatching aviation stakeholders to a range of sensitive information types andassess the impact for each. based on more than one million acars messages,collected over several months, we then demonstrate that current acars usagesystematically breaches privacy for all stakeholder groups. we further supportour findings with a number of cases of significant privacy issues for eachgroup and analyze the impact of such leaks. while it is well-known that acarsmessages are susceptible to eavesdropping attacks, this work is the first toquantify the extent and impact of privacy leakage in the real world for therelevant aviation stakeholders.
