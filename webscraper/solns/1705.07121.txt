advancements in healthcare industry with new technology and population growthhas given rise to security threat to our most personal data. the healthcaredata management system consists of records in different formats such as text,numeric, pictures and videos leading to data which is big and unstructured.also, hospitals have several branches at different locations throughout acountry and overseas. in view of these requirements a cloud based healthcaremanagement system can be an effective solution for efficient health care datamanagement. one of the major concerns of a cloud based healthcare system is thesecurity aspect. it includes theft to identity, tax fraudulence, insurancefrauds, medical frauds and defamation of high profile patients. hence, a securedata access and retrieval is needed in order to provide security of criticalmedical records in health care management system. biometric authenticationmechanism is suitable in this scenario since it overcomes the limitations oftoken theft and forgetting passwords in conventional token id-passwordmechanism used for providing security. it also has high accuracy rate forsecure data access and retrieval. in this paper we propose bamhealthcloud whichis a cloud based system for management of healthcare data, it ensures securityof data through biometric authentication. it has been developed afterperforming a detailed case study on healthcare sector in a developing country.training of the signature samples for authentication purpose has been performedin parallel on hadoop mapreduce framework using resilient backpropagationneural network. from rigorous experiments it can be concluded that it achievesa speedup of 9x, equal error rate (eer) of 0.12, sensitivity of 0.98 andspecificity of 0.95 as compared to other approaches existing in literature.
