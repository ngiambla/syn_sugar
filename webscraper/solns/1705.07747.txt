every year approximately 234 million major surgeries are performed, leadingto plentiful, highly diverse data. this is accompanied by a matching number ofnovel algorithms for the surgical domain. to garner all benefits of surgicaldata science it is necessary to have an unambiguous, shared understanding ofalgorithms and data. this includes inputs and outputs of algorithms and thustheir function, but also the semantic content, i.e. meaning of data such aspatient parameters. we therefore propose the establishment of a new ontologyfor data and algorithms in surgical data science. such an ontology can be usedto provide common data sets for the community, encouraging sharing of knowledgeand comparison of algorithms on common data. we hold that this is a necessaryfoundation towards new methods for applications such as semantic-based contentretrieval and similarity measures and that it is overall vital for the futureof surgical data science.
