plain vanilla k-means clustering is prone to produce unbalanced clusters andsuffers from outlier sensitivity. to mitigate both shortcomings, we formulate ajoint outlier detection and clustering problem, which assigns a prescribednumber of datapoints to an auxiliary outlier cluster and performscardinality-constrained k-means clustering on the residual dataset. we castthis problem as a mixed-integer linear program (milp) that admits tractablesemidefinite and linear programming relaxations. we propose deterministicrounding schemes that transform the relaxed solutions to feasible solutions forthe milp. we also prove that these solutions are optimal in the milp if acluster separation condition holds.
