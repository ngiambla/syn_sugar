there is little knowledge available on the spatial behaviour of urbantourists, and yet tourists generate an enormous quantity of data (big data)when they visit cities. these data sources can be used to track their presencethrough their activities. the aim of this paper is to analyse the digitalfootprint of urban tourists through big data. unlike other papers that use asingle data source, this article examines three sources of data to reflectdifferent tourism activities in cities: panoramio (sightseeing), foursquare(consumption), and twitter (being connected). tourist density in the three datasources is compared via maps, correlation analysis (ols) and spatialself-correlation analysis (global moran's i statistic and lisa). finally thedata are integrated using cluster analysis and combining the spatial clustersidentified in the lisa analysis in the different data sources. the results showthat the data from the three activities are partly spatially redundant andpartly complementary, and allow the characterisation of multifunction touristspaces (with several activities) and spaces specialising in one or variousactivities (for example, sightseeing and consumption). the case study analysed(madrid) reveals a significant presence of tourists in the city centre, andincreasing specialisation from the centre outwards towards the periphery. themain conclusion of the paper is that it is not sufficient to use one datasource to analyse the presence of tourists in cities; several must be used in acomplementary manner.
