social network data offer interesting opportunities in urban studies. in thisstudy, we used twitter data to analyse city dynamics over the course of theday. users of this social network were grouped according to city zone and timeslot in order to analyse the daily dynamics of the city and the relationshipbetween this and land use. first, daytime activity in each zone was comparedwith activity at night in order to determine which zones showed increasedactivity in each of the time slots. then, typical twitter activity profileswere obtained based on the predominant land use in each zone, indicating howland uses linked to activities were activated during the day, but at differentrates depending on the type of land use. lastly, a multiple regression analysiswas performed to determine the influence of the different land uses on each ofthe major time slots (morning, afternoon, evening and night) through theirchanging coefficients. activity tended to decrease throughout the day for mostland uses (e.g. offices, education, health and transport), but remainedconstant in parks and increased in retail and residential zones. our resultsshow that social network data can be used to improve our understanding of thelink between land use and urban dynamics.
