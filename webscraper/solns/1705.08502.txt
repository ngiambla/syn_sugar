i point to a deep and unjustly ignored relation between culture andcomputation. i first establish interpretations of piaget's and vygotsky'stheories of child development with the language of theoretical computerscience. using these interpretations, i argue that the two different possibleroutes to piagetian disequilibrium -- a tendency to overaccommodate, and atendency to overassimilate -- are equivalent to the two distinct culturaltendencies, collectivistism and individualism. i argue that this simplecharacterization of overaccommodation versus overassimilation provides asatisfying explanation as to why the two cultural tendencies differ in the waythey empirically do. all such notions are grounded on a firm mathematicalframework for those who prefer the computable, and grounded on my personalhistory for those who prefer the uncomputable.
