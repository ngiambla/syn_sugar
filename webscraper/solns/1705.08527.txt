we extend recent work by van der laan (2014) on causal inference for causallyconnected units to more general social network settings. our asymptotic resultsallow for dependence of each observation on a growing number of other units assample size increases. we are not aware of any previous methods for inferenceabout network members in observational settings that allow the number of tiesper node to increase as the network grows. while previous methods havegenerally implicitly focused on one of two possible sources of dependence amongsocial network observations, we allow for both dependence due to contagion, ortransmission of information across network ties, and for dependence due tolatent similarities among nodes sharing ties. we describe estimation andinference for causal effects that are specifically of interest in socialnetwork settings.
