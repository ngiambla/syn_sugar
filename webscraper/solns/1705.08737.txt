the aim of this paper is to study the metastable properties of the solutionsto a hyperbolic relaxation of the classic cahn-hilliard equation in one spacedimension, subject to either neumann or dirichlet boundary conditions. toperform this goal, we make use of an "energy approach", already proposed forvarious evolution pdes, including the allen-cahn and the cahn-hilliardequations. in particular, we shall prove that certain solutions maintain a {\it$n$-transition layer structure} for a very long time, thus proving theirmetastable dynamics. more precisely, we will show that, for an exponentiallylong time, such solutions are very close to piecewise constant functionsassuming only the minimal points of the potential, with a finitely number oftransition points, which move with an exponentially small velocity.
