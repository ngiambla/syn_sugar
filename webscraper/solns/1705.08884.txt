in 2002, the european union (eu) introduced the eprivacy directive toregulate the usage of online tracking technologies. its aim is to make trackingmechanisms explicit while increasing privacy awareness in users. it mandateswebsites to ask for explicit consent before using any kind of profilingmethodology, e.g., cookies. starting from 2013 the directive is mandatory, andnow most of european websites embed a "cookie bar" to explicitly ask user'sconsent. to the best of our knowledge, no study focused in checking whether awebsite respects the directive. for this, we engineer cookiecheck, a simpletool that makes this check automatic. we use it to run a measure- ment campaignon more than 35,000 websites. results depict a dramatic picture: 65% ofwebsites do not respect the directive and install tracking cookies before theuser is even offered the accept button. in few words, we testify the failure ofthe eprivacy directive. among motivations, we identify the absence of rulesenabling systematic auditing procedures, the lack of tools to verify itsimplementation by the deputed agencies, and the technical difficulties ofwebmasters in implementing it.
