blocks-based programming has become the lingua franca for introductorycoding. studies have found that experience with blocks-based programming canhelp beginners learn more traditional text-based languages. we explore howblocks environments improve learnability for novices by 1) favoring recognitionover recall, 2) reducing cognitive load, and 3) preventing errors. increasedusability of blocks programming has led to widespread adoption withinintroductory programming contexts across a range of ages. ongoing work exploresfurther reducing barriers to programming, supporting novice programmers inexpanding their programming skills, and transitioning to textual programming.new blocks frameworks are making it easier to access a variety of apis throughblocks environments, opening the doors to a greater diversity of programmingdomains and supporting greater experimentation for novices and professionalsalike.
