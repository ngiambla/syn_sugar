we develop a theory of small cancellation theory in the variety of burnsidegroups. more precisely, we show that there exists a critical exponent $n_0$such that for every odd $n\geq n_0$, the well-known classical $c'(1/6)$-smallcancellation theory, as well as its graphical generalization and its versionfor free products, produce examples of infinite $n$-periodic groups. our resultgives a powerful tool for producing (uncountable collections of) examples ofperiodic groups with prescribed properties. it can be applied without any priorknowledge in the subject of periodic groups.  as applications, we show the undecidability of markov properties in classesof periodic groups, we produce periodic groups with expander graphs embedded intheir cayley graphs, and we give an $n$-periodic rips construction. we alsoobtain simpler proofs of the known results like the existence of uncountablymany finitely generated periodic groups and the sq-universality (in the classof periodic groups) of free burnside groups.
