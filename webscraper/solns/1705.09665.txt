a community's identity defines and shapes its internal dynamics. our currentunderstanding of this interplay is mostly limited to glimpses gathered fromisolated studies of individual communities. in this work we provide asystematic exploration of the nature of this relation across a wide variety ofonline communities. to this end we introduce a quantitative, language-basedtypology reflecting two key aspects of a community's identity: how distinctive,and how temporally dynamic it is. by mapping almost 300 reddit communities intothe landscape induced by this typology, we reveal regularities in how patternsof user engagement vary with the characteristics of a community.  our results suggest that the way new and existing users engage with acommunity depends strongly and systematically on the nature of the collectiveidentity it fosters, in ways that are highly consequential to communitymaintainers. for example, communities with distinctive and highly dynamicidentities are more likely to retain their users. however, such nichecommunities also exhibit much larger acculturation gaps between existing usersand newcomers, which potentially hinder the integration of the latter.  more generally, our methodology reveals differences in how various socialphenomena manifest across communities, and shows that structuring themulti-community landscape can lead to a better understanding of the systematicnature of this diversity.
