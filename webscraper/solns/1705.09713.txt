objective: to test the hypothesis that variation in care coordination isrelated to los. design we applied a spectral co-clustering methodology tosimultaneously infer groups of patients and care coordination patterns, in theform of interaction networks of health care professionals, from electronicmedical record (emr) utilization data. the care coordination pattern for eachpatient group was represented by standard social network characteristics andits relationship with hospital los was assessed via a negative binomialregression with a 95% confidence interval. setting and patients this studyfocuses on 5,588 adult patients hospitalized for trauma at the vanderbiltuniversity medical center. the emrs were accessed by healthcare professionalsfrom 179 operational areas during 158,467 operational actions. main outcomemeasures: hospital los for trauma inpatients, as an indicator of carecoordination efficiency. results: three general types of care coordinationpatterns were discovered, each of which was affiliated with a specific patientgroup. the first patient group exhibited the shortest hospital los and wasmanaged by a care coordination pattern that involved the smallest number ofoperational areas (102 areas, as opposed to 125 and 138 for the other patientgroups), but exhibited the largest number of collaborations between operationalareas (e.g., an average of 27.1 connections per operational area compared to22.5 and 23.3 for the other two groups). the hospital los for the second andthird patient groups was 14 hours (p = 0.024) and 10 hours (p = 0.042) longerthan the first patient group, respectively.
