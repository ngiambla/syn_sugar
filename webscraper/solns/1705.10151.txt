ten types of discrete fourier transforms of weyl orbit functions aredeveloped. generalizing one-dimensional cosine, sine and exponential, each typeof the weyl orbit function represents an exponential symmetrized with respectto a subgroup of the weyl group. fundamental domains of even affine and dualeven affine weyl groups, governing the argument and label symmetries of theeven orbit functions, are determined. the discrete orthogonality relations areformulated on finite sets of points from the refinements of the dual weightlattices. explicit counting formulas for the number of points of the discretetransforms are deduced. real-valued hartley orbit functions are introduced andall ten types of the corresponding discrete hartley transforms are detailed.
