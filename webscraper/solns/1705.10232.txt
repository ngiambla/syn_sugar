semilinear stochastic partial differential equations on bounded domains$\mathscr{d}$ are considered. the semilinear term may have arbitrary polynomialgrowth as long as it is continuous and monotone except perhaps near the origin.a typical example is the stochastic ginzburg--landau equation. the main resultof this article are $l^p$-estimates for such equations. the $l^p$-estimates aresubsequently employed in obtaining higher regularity. it is shown, underappropriate assumptions, that the solution is continuous in time with values inthe sobolev space $h^2(\mathscr{d}')$ and $l^2$-integrable with values in$h^3(\mathscr{d}')$, for any compact $\mathscr{d}' \subset \mathscr{d}$. usingresults from $l^p$-theory of spdes obtained by kim we get analogous results inweighted sobolev spaces on the whole $\mathscr{d}$. finally it is shown thatthe solution is h\"older continuous in time of order $\frac{1}{2} -\frac{2}{q}$ as a process with values in a weighted $l^q$-space, where $q$arises from the integrability assumptions imposed on the initial condition andforcing terms.
