let ${\bf h}_{\mathbb c}^n$ be the $n$-dimensional complex hyperbolic spaceand ${\rm su}(n,1)$ be the isometry group. an element $g$ in ${\rm su}(n,1)$ iscalled loxodromic or hyperbolic if it has exactly two fixed points on theboundary $\partial {\bf h}_{\mathbb c}^n$. we classify pairs of loxodromicelements in ${\rm su}(n,1)$ up to conjugacy.
