there exists a critical speed of propagation of the line solitons in thezakharov-kuznetsov (zk) equation such that small transversely periodicperturbations are unstable for line solitons with larger-than-critical speedsand orbitally stable for those with smaller-than-critical speeds. the normalform for transverse instability of the line soliton with a nearly criticalspeed of propagation is derived by means of symplectic projections andnear-identity transformations. justification of this normal form is providedwith the energy method. the normal form predicts a transformation of theunstable line solitons with larger-than-critical speeds to the orbitally stabletransversely modulated solitary waves.
