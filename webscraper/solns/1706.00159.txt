koopman operator is a composition operator defined for a dynamical systemdescribed by nonlinear differential or difference equation. although theoriginal system is nonlinear and evolves on a finite-dimensional state space,the koopman operator itself is linear but infinite-dimensional (evolves on afunction space). this linear operator captures the full information of thedynamics described by the original nonlinear system. in particular, spectralproperties of the koopman operator play a crucial role in analyzing theoriginal system. in the first part of this paper, we review the so-calledkoopman operator theory for nonlinear dynamical systems, with emphasis on modaldecomposition and computation that are direct to wide applications. then, inthe second part, we present a series of applications of the koopman operatortheory to power systems technology. the applications are established asdata-centric methods, namely, how to use massive quantities of data obtainednumerically and experimentally, through spectral analysis of the koopmanoperator: coherency identification of swings in coupled synchronous generators,precursor diagnostic of instabilities in the coupled swing dynamics, andstability assessment of power systems without any use of mathematical models.future problems of this research direction are identified in the lastconcluding part of this paper.
