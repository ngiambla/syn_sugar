we present a method to sum borel- and gevrey-summable asymptotic series bymatching the series to be summed with a linear combination of asymptotic seriesof known functions that themselves are scaled versions of a single,appropriate, but otherwise unrestricted, function $\phi$. both the scaling andlinear coefficients are calculated from pad\'e approximants of a seriestransformed from the original series by $\phi$. we discuss in particular thecase that $\phi$ is (essentially) a confluent hypergeometric function, whichincludes as special cases the standard borel-pad\'e and borel-leroy-pad\'emethods. a particular advantage is the mechanism to build knowledge about thesummed function into the approximants, extending their accuracy and range evenwhen only a few coefficients are available. several examples from field theoryand rayleigh-schr\"odinger perturbation theory illustrate the method.
