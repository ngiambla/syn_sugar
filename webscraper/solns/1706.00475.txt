we study which algebras have tilting modules that are both generated andcogenerated by projective-injective modules. crawley-boevey and sauter haveshown that auslander algebras have such tilting modules; and for algebras ofglobal dimension $2$, auslander algebras are classified by the existence ofsuch tilting modules.  in this paper, we show that the existence of such a tilting module isequivalent to the algebra having dominant dimension at least $2$, independentof its global dimension. in general such a tilting module is not necessarilycotilting. here, we show that the algebras which have a tilting-cotiltingmodule generated-cogenerated by projective-injective modules are precisely$1$-auslander-gorenstein algebras.  when considering such a tilting module, without the assumption that it iscotilting, we study the global dimension of its endomorphism algebra, anddiscuss a connection with the finitistic dimension conjecture. furthermore, asspecial cases, we show that triangular matrix algebras obtained from auslanderalgebras and certain injective modules, have such a tilting module. we alsogive a description of which nakayama algebras have such a tilting module.
