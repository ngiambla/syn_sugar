the family of lattice simplices in $\mathbb{r}^n$ formed by the convex hullof the standard basis vectors together with a weakly decreasing vector ofnegative integers include simplices that play a central role in problems inenumerative algebraic geometry and mirror symmetry. from this perspective, itis useful to have formulae for their discrete volumes via ehrhart$h^\ast$-polynomials. here we show, via an association with numeral systems,that such simplices yield $h^\ast$-polynomials with properties that are alsodesirable from a combinatorial perspective. first, we identify $n$-simplices inthis family that associate via their normalized volume to the $n^{th}$ placevalue of a positional numeral system. we then observe that their$h^\ast$-polynomials admit combinatorial formula via descent-like statistics onthe numeral strings encoding the nonnegative integers within the system. withthese methods, we recover ubiquitous $h^\ast$-polynomials including theeulerian polynomials and the binomial coefficients arising from the factoradicand binary numeral systems, respectively. we generalize the binary case tobase-$r$ numeral systems for all $r\geq2$, and prove that the associated$h^\ast$-polynomials are real-rooted and unimodal for $r\geq2$ and $n\geq1$.
