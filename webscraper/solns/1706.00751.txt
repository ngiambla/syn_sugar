adapting the spectral viewpoint suggested in ledoux (2012) in the context ofsymmetric markov diffusion generators and recently exploited in thenon-diffusive setup of a poisson random measure by d\"obler and peccati (2017),we investigate the fourth moment condition for discrete multiple integrals withrespect to general, i.e.\ non-symmetric and non-homogeneous, rademachersequences and show that, in this situation, the fourth moment alone does notgovern the asymptotic normality. indeed, here one also has to take intoconsideration the maximal influence of the corresponding kernel functions. inparticular, we show that there is no exact fourth moment theorem for discretemultiple integrals of order $m\geq2$ with respect to a symmetric rademachersequence. this behavior, which is in contrast to the gaussian (see nualart andpeccati (2005)) and poisson (see d\"obler and peccati (2017)) situation,closely resembles the conditions for asymptotic normality of degenerate,non-symmetric $u$-statistics from the classical paper by de jong (1990).
