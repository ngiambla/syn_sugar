we improve previously known lower bounds for the minimum distance of certaintwo-point ag codes constructed using a generalized giulietti-korchmaros curve(ggk). castellanos and tizziotti recently described such bounds for two-pointcodes coming from the giulietti-korchmaros curve (gk). our results completelycover and in many cases improve on their results, using different techniques,while also supporting any ggk curve. our method builds on the order bound forag codes: to enable this, we study certain weierstrass semigroups. this allowsan efficient algorithm for computing our improved bounds. we find several newimprovements upon the mint minimum distance tables.
