recently peter keevash solved asymptotically the existence question forsteiner systems by showing that $s(t,k,n)$ exists whenever the necessarydivisibility conditions on the parameters are satisfied and $n$ is sufficientlylarge in terms of $k$ and $t$. the purpose of this paper is to make aconjecture which if true would be a significant extension of keevash's theorem,and to give some theoretical and computational evidence for the conjecture.  we phrase the conjecture in terms of the notions (which we define here) ofsynchronization and separation for association schemes. these definitions arebased on those for permutation groups which grow out of the theory ofsynchronization in finite automata. in this theory, two classes of permutationgroups (called \emph{synchronizing} and \emph{separating}) lying betweenprimitive and $2$-homogeneous are defined. a big open question is how thepermutation group induced by $s_n$ on $k$-subsets of $\{1,\ldots,n\}$ fits inthis hierarchy; our conjecture would give a solution to this problem for $n$large in terms of $k$. we prove the conjecture in the case $k=4$: our resultasserts that $s_n$ acting on $4$-sets is separating for $n\ge10$ (it fails tobe synchronizing for $n=9$).
