we study robust convex quadratically constrained quadratic programs where theuncertain problem parameters can contain both continuous and integercomponents. under the natural boundedness assumption on the uncertainty set, weshow that the generic problems are amenable to exact copositive programmingreformulations of polynomial size. the emerging convex optimization problemsare np-hard but admit a conservative semidefinite programming (sdp)approximation that can be solved efficiently. we prove that this approximationis stronger than the popular approximate $\mathcal s$-lemma method for probleminstances with only continuous uncertainty. we also show that all results canbe extended to the two-stage robust optimization setting if the problem hascomplete recourse. we assess the effectiveness of our proposed sdpreformulations and demonstrate their superiority over the state-of-the-artsolution schemes on stylized instances of least squares, project management,and multi-item newsvendor problems.
