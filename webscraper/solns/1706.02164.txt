a coarse assembly map relates the coarsification of a generalized homologytheory with a coarse version of that homology theory. in the present paper weprovide a motivic approach to coarse assembly maps. to every coarse homologytheory $e$ we naturally associate a homology theory $e\mathcal{o}^{\infty}$ andconstruct an assembly map $$\mu_{e}:\mathrm{coarsification}(e\mathcal{o}^{\infty})\to e\ .$$ for sufficiently nicespaces $x$ we relate the value $e\mathcal{o}^{\infty}(x)$ with the locallyfinite homology of $x$ with coefficients in $e(*)$. in the example of coarse$k$-homology we discuss the relation of our motivic constructions with theclassical constructions using $c^{*}$-algebra techniques.
