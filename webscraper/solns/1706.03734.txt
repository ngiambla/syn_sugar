we show that if an asymptotically flat manifold with horizon boundary admitsa global static potential, then the static potential must be zero on theboundary. we also show that if an asymptotically flat manifold with horizonboundary admits an unbounded static potential in the exterior region, then themanifold must contain a complete non-compact area minimizing hypersurface. someresults related to the riemannian positive mass theorem and bartnik'squasi-local mass are obtained.
