we consider channel estimation (ce) in narrowband internet-of-things (nb-iot)systems. due to the fluctuations in phase within receiver and transmitteroscillators, and also the residual frequency offset (fo) caused bydiscontinuous receiving of repetition coded transmit data-blocks, random phasenoises are presented in received signals. although the coherent-time of fadingchannel can be assumed fairly long due to the low-mobility of nb-iotuser-equipments (ues), such phase noises have to be considered before combiningthe the channel estimates over repetition copies to improve their accuracies.in this paper, we derive a sequential minimum-mean-square-error (mmse) channelestimator in the presence of random phase noise that refines the cesequentially with each received repetition copy, which has a low-complexity anda small data storage. further, we show through simulations that, the proposedsequential mmse estimator improves the mean-square-error (mse) of ce by 1 db inthe low signal-to-noise ratio (snr) regime, compared to a traditionalsequential mmse estimator that does not thoroughly consider the impact ofrandom phase noises.
