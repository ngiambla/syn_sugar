we propose an information-theoretic framework to quantify multipartitecorrelations in classical and quantum systems, answering questions such as:what is the amount of seven-partite correlations in a given state of tenparticles? we identify measures of genuine multipartite correlations, i.e.statistical dependencies which cannot be ascribed to bipartite correlations,satisfying a set of desirable properties. inspired by ideas developed incomplexity science, we then introduce the concept of weaving to classify stateswhich display different correlation patterns, but cannot be distinguished bycorrelation measures. the weaving of a state is defined as the weighted sum ofcorrelations of every order. weaving measures are good descriptors of thecomplexity of correlation structures in multipartite systems.
