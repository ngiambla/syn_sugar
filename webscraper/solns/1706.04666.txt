we elaborate on the extended hilbert space factorization of chern simonstheory and show how this arises naturally from a proper regularization of theentangling surface in the euclidean path integral. the regularization amountsto stretching the entangling surface into a co-dimension one surface whichhosts edge modes of the chern simons theory when quantized on a spatialsubregion. the factorized state is a regularized ishibashi state and reproducesthe well known topological entanglement entropies. we illustrate how the samefactorization arises from the glueing of two spatial subregions via theentangling product defined by donnelly and freidel.
