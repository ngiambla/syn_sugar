we construct a self-similar local regular dirichlet form on the sierpi\'nskigasket using $\gamma$-convergence of stable-like non-local closed forms. such adirichlet form was constructed previously by kigami \cite{kig01}, but ourconstruction has the advantage that it is a realization of a more generalmethod of construction of a local regular dirichlet form that works also on thesierpi\'nski carpet \cite{gy17}. a direct consequence of this construction isthe fact that the domain of the local dirichlet form is some besov space.
