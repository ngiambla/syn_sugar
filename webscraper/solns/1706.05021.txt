we consider actions for particles and strings, including twistorialdescriptions on 4d minkowski and ads$_5$ spacetimes from the point of view ofco-adjoint orbits for the isometry group. we also consider the collectivecoordinate dynamics of singular solutions in chern-simons (cs) theories and cstheories of gravity. this is a generalization of the work of einstein, infeldand hoffmann and also has potential points of contact with fluid-gravitycorrespondence.
