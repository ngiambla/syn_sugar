given a positive integer $m$ and $q\in(1,m+1]$, let $\mathcal u_q$ be the setof $x\in[0, m/(q-1)]$ having a unique $q$-expansion: there exists a uniquesequence $(x_i)=x_1x_2\ldots$ with each $x_i\in\{0,1,\ldots, m\}$ such that  \[  x=\frac{x_1}{q}+\frac{x_2}{q^2}+\frac{x_3}{q^3}+\cdots.  \]  denote by $\mathbf u_q$ the set of corresponding sequences of all points in$\mathcal u_q$.  it is well-known that the function $h: q\mapsto h(\mathbf u_q)$ is a devil'sstaircase, where $h(\mathbf u_q)$ denotes the topological entropy of $\mathbfu_q$. in this paper we {give several characterizations of} the bifurcation set  \[  \mathcal b:=\{q\in(1,m+1]: h(p)\ne h(q)\textrm{ for any }p\ne q\}.  \] note that $\mathcal b$ is contained in the set $\mathcal{u}^r$ of bases$q\in(1,m+1]$ such that $1\in\mathcal u_q$. by using a transversality techniquewe also calculate the hausdorff dimension of the difference $\mathcalb\backslash\mathcal{u}^r$. interestingly this quantity is always strictlybetween $0$ and $1$. when $m=1$ the hausdorff dimension of $\mathcalb\backslash\mathcal{u}^r$ is $\frac{\log 2}{3\log \lambda^*}\approx 0.368699$,where $\lambda^*$ is the unique root in $(1, 2)$ of the equation$x^5-x^4-x^3-2x^2+x+1=0$.
