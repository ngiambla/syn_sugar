we develop a method to construct 4-dimensional artin-schelter regularalgebras as normal extensions of (not necessarily noetherian) 3-dimensionalones. the method produces large classes of new 4-dimensional artin-schelterregular algebras. when applied to a 3-calabi-yau algebra our method produces aflat family of central extensions of it that are 4-calabi-yau, and all4-calabi-yau central extensions having the same generating set as the original3-calabi-yau algebra arise in this way. some of the 2-generated 4-dimensionalartin-schelter regular algebras discovered by lu-palmieri-wu-zhang can beobtained by our method and our results provide a new proof of their regularity.each normal extension has the same generators as the original 3-dimensionalalgebra, and its relations consist of all but one of the relations for theoriginal algebra and an equal number of new relations determined by "themissing one" and a tuple of scalars satisfying some numerical conditions. wedetermine the nakayama automorphisms of the 4-dimensional algebras obtained byour method and as a consequence show that their homological determinant is 1.this supports a conjecture by mori-smith that the homological determinant ofthe nakayama automorphism is 1 for all artin-schelter regular connected gradedalgebras. reyes-rogalski-zhang proved this is true in the noetherian case.
