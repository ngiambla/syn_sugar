recently, a hydrodynamic description of local equilibrium dynamics in quantumintegrable systems was discovered. in the diffusionless limit, this isequivalent to a certain "bethe-boltzmann" kinetic equation, which has the formof an integro-differential conservation law in $(1+1)$d. the purpose of thepresent work is to investigate the sense in which the bethe-boltzmann equationdefines an "integrable kinetic equation". to this end, we study a class of $n$dimensional systems of evolution equations that arise naturally asfinite-dimensional approximations to the bethe-boltzmann equation. we obtainnon-local poisson brackets and hamiltonian densities for these equations andderive an infinite family of first integrals, parameterized by $n$ functionaldegrees of freedom. we find that the conserved charges arising from quantumintegrability map to casimir invariants of the hydrodynamic bracket and theirgroup velocities map to hamiltonian flows. some results from thefinite-dimensional setting extend to the underlying integro-differentialequation, providing evidence for its integrability in the hydrodynamic sense.
