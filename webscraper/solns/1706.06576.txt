given a normal toric algebra $r$, we compute a uniform integer $d = d(r) > 0$such that the symbolic power $p^{(d n)} \subseteq p^n$ for all $n >0$ and allmonomial primes $p$. we compute the multiplier $d$ explicitly in terms of thepolyhedral cone data defining $r$. in this toric setting, we draw a connectionwith the f-signature of $r$ in positive characteristic.
