let $(m,g)$ be a compact $n$-dimensional riemannian manifold without boundaryand $e_\lambda$ be an $l^2$-normalized eigenfunction of the laplace-beltramioperator with respect to the metric $g$, i.e \[  -\delta_g e_\lambda = \lambda^2 e_\lambda \qquad \text{ and } \qquad \|e_\lambda \|_{l^2(m)} = 1. \] let $\sigma$ be a $d$-dimensional submanifold and$d\mu$ a smooth, compactly supported measure on $\sigma$. it is well-known(e.g. proved by zelditch in far greater generality) that \[  \int_\sigma e_\lambda \, d\mu = o(\lambda^\frac{n-d-1}{2}). \] we show thisbound improves to $o(\lambda^\frac{n-d-1}{2})$ provided the set of loopingdirections, \[  \mathcal{l}_{\sigma} = \{ (x,\xi) \in sn^*\sigma : \phi_t(x,\xi) \insn^*\sigma \text{ for some } t > 0 \} \] has measure zero as a subset of$sn^*\sigma$, where here $\phi_t$ is the geodesic flow on the cosphere bundle$s^*m$ and $sn^*\sigma$ is the unit conormal bundle over $\sigma$.
