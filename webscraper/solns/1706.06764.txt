we analyze successive cancellation (sc) decoder by using two randomfunctions. the first function is related to the likelihoods of 0 and 1 in eachcode position, while the second gives the difference between their posteriorprobabilities. we then study the second power moments of both functions. weshow that these moments are being squared in channel transformations, whiletheir product tends to 0 for growing lengths $n$. this gives an elementaryproof of polarization properties of sc decoding. we also derive a simpleordering of decoding channels with construction complexity of order $n\log n$.
