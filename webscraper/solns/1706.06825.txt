fisher proved in 1940 that any $2$-$(v,k,\lambda)$ design with $v>k$ has atleast $v$ blocks. in 1975 ray-chaudhuri and wilson generalised this result byshowing that every $t$-$(v,k,\lambda)$ design with $v \geq k+\lfloor t/2\rfloor$ has at least $\binom{v}{\lfloor t/2 \rfloor}$ blocks. by combiningmethods used by bose and wilson in proofs of these results, we obtain new lowerbounds on the size of $t$-$(v,k,\lambda)$ coverings. our results generaliselower bounds on the size of $2$-$(v,k,\lambda)$ coverings recently obtained bythe first author.
