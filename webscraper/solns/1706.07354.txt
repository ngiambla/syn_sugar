we give a construction of the second chern number of a vector bundle over asmooth projective surface by means of adelic transition matrices for the vectorbundle. the construction does not use an algebraic $k$-theory and depends onthe canonical $\mathbb{z}$-torsor of a locally linearly compact $k$-vectorspace. analogs of certain auxiliary results for the case of an arithmeticsurface are also discussed.
