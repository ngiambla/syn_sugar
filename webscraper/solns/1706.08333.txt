we consider uniform random permutations in proper substitution-closed classesand study their limiting behavior in the sense of permutons.  the limit depends on the generating series of the simple permutations in theclass. under a mild sufficient condition, the limit is an elementaryone-parameter deformation of the limit of uniform separable permutations,previously identified as the brownian separable permuton. this limiting objectis therefore in some sense universal. we identify two other regimes withdifferent limiting objects. the first one is degenerate; the second one isnontrivial and related to stable trees.  these results are obtained thanks to a characterization of the convergence ofrandom permutons through the convergence of their expected pattern densities.the limit of expected pattern densities is then computed by using thesubstitution tree encoding of permutations and performing singularity analysison the tree series.
