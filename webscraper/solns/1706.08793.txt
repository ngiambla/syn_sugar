we consider the classical calogero-sutherland system with two types ofinteracting spin variables. it can be reduced to the standardcalogero-sutherland system, when one of the spin variables vanishes. wedescribe the model in the hitchin approach and prove complete integrability ofthe system by constructing the lax pair and the classical $r$-matrix with thespectral parameter on a singular curve.
