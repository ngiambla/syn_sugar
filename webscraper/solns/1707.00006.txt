we consider classical, pure yang-mills theory in a box. we show how a set ofstatic electric fields that solve the theory in an adiabatic limit correspondto geodesic motion on the space of vacua, equipped with a particular riemannianmetric that we identify. the vacua are generated by spontaneously broken globalgauge symmetries, leading to an infinite number of conserved momenta of thegeodesic motion. we show that these correspond to the soft multipole charges ofyang-mills theory.
