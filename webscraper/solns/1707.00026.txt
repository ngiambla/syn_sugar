weighted least squares polynomial approximation uses random samples todetermine projections of functions onto spaces of polynomials. it has beenshown that, using an optimal distribution of sample locations, the number ofsamples required to achieve quasi-optimal approximation in a given polynomialsubspace scales, up to a logarithmic factor, linearly in the dimension of thisspace. however, in many applications, the computation of samples includes anumerical discretization error. thus, obtaining polynomial approximations witha single level method can become prohibitively expensive, as it requires asufficiently large number of samples, each computed with a sufficiently smalldiscretization error. as a solution to this problem, we propose a multilevelmethod that utilizes samples computed with different accuracies and is able tomatch the accuracy of single-level approximations with reduced computationalcost. we derive complexity bounds under certain assumptions about polynomialapproximability and sample work. furthermore, we propose an adaptive algorithmfor situations where such assumptions cannot be verified a priori. finally, weprovide an efficient algorithm for the sampling from optimal distributions andan analysis of computationally favorable alternative distributions. numericalexperiments underscore the practical applicability of our method.
