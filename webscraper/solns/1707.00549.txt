permutation polynomials over finite fields are an interesting subject due totheir important applications in the areas of mathematics and engineering. inthis paper we investigate the trinomial $f(x)=x^{(p-1)q+1}+x^{pq}-x^{q+(p-1)}$over the finite field $\mathbb{f}_{q^2}$, where $p$ is an odd prime and $q=p^k$with $k$ being a positive integer. it is shown that when $p=3$ or $5$, $f(x)$is a permutation trinomial of $\mathbb{f}_{q^2}$ if and only if $k$ is even.this property is also true for more general class of polynomials$g(x)=x^{(q+1)l+(p-1)q+1}+x^{(q+1)l+pq}-x^{(q+1)l+q+(p-1)}$, where $l$ is anonnegative integer and $\gcd(2l+p,q-1)=1$. moreover, we also show that for$p=5$ the permutation trinomials $f(x)$ proposed here are new in the sense thatthey are not multiplicative equivalent to previously known ones of similarform.
