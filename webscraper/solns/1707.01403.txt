for a compact homogeneous space $g/k$, we study the problem of existence of$g$-invariant riemannian metrics such that each eigenspace of the laplacian isa real irreducible representation of $g$. we prove that the normal metric of acompact irreducible symmetric space has this property only in rank one.furthermore, we provide existence results for such metrics on certain isotropyreducible spaces.
