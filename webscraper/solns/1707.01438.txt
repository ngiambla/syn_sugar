under very general conditions it is shown that if $a$ is a uniform algebragenerated by real-analytic functions, then either $a$ consists of allcontinuous functions or else there exists a disc on which every function in $a$is holomorphic. this strengthens several earlier results concerning uniformalgebras generated by real-analytic functions.
