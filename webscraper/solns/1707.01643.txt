in this paper we consider a two component scalar field theory, withnoncommutativity in its conjugate momentum space. we quantize such a theory ina compact space with the help of dressing transformations and we reveal asignificant effect of introducing such noncommutativity as the splitting of theenergy levels of each individual mode that constitutes the whole system. wefurther compute the thermal partition function exactly with predicted deformeddispersion relations from noncommutative theories and compare the results withusual results. it is found that thermodynamic quantities in noncommutativemodels, irrespective of whether the model is more deformed in infrared/uvregion, show deviation from standard results in high temperature region.
