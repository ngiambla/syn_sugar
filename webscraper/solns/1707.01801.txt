we present a novel framework for addressing the nonlinear landau collisionintegral in terms of finite element and other subspace projection methods. weemploy the underlying metriplectic structure of the landau collision integraland, using a galerkin discretization for the velocity space, we transform theinfinite-dimensional system into a finite-dimensional, time-continuousmetriplectic system. temporal discretization is accomplished using the conceptof discrete gradients. the conservation of energy, momentum, and particledensities, as well as the production of entropy is demonstrated algebraicallyfor the fully discrete system. due to the generality of our approach, theconservation properties and the monotonic behavior of entropy are guaranteedfor finite element discretizations in general, independently of the meshconfiguration.
