let $t$ be a consistent o-minimal theory extending the theory of denselyordered groups and let $t'$ be a consistent theory. then there is a completetheory $t^*$ extending $t$ such that $t$ is an open core of $t^*$, but everymodel of $t^*$ interprets a model of $t'$. if $t'$ is nip, $t^*$ can be chosento be nip as well. from this we deduce the existence of an nip expansion of thereal field that has no distal expansion.
