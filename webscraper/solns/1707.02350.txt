we establish the long-time existence of large-data weak solutions to a systemof nonlinear partial differential equations. the system of interest governs themotion of non-newtonian fluids described by a simplified viscoelastic rate-typemodel with a stress-diffusion term. the simplified model shares manyqualitative features with more complex viscoelastic rate-type models that arefrequently used in the modeling of fluids with complicated microstructure. assuch, the simplified model provides important preliminary insight into themathematical properties of these more complex and practically relevant modelsof non-newtonian fluids. the simplified model that is analyzed from themathematical perspective is shown to be thermodynamically consistent, and weextensively comment on the interplay between the thermodynamical background ofthe model and the mathematical analysis of the correspondinginitial-boundary-value problem.
