in this paper we prove uniform hausdorff and packing dimension results forthe images of a large family of markov processes. the main tools are the twocovering principles of xiao (second author). as applications, uniform hausdorffand packing dimension results for certain classes of l\'evy processes, stablejump diffusion and non-symmetric stable-like processes are obtained.
