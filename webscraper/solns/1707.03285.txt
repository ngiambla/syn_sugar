we study the $r$-th generalized minimum distance function (gmd function forshort) and the corresponding generalized footprint function of a graded idealin a polynomial ring over a field. if $\mathbb{x}$ is a set of projectivepoints over a finite field and $i(\mathbb{x})$ is its vanishing ideal, we showthat the gmd function and the vasconcelos function of $i(\mathbb{x})$ are equalto the $r$-th generalized hamming weight of the corresponding reed-muller-typecode $c_\mathbb{x}(d)$. we show that the $r$-th generalized footprint functionof $i(\mathbb{x})$ is a lower bound for the $r$-th generalized hamming weightof $c_\mathbb{x}(d)$. as an application to coding theory we show an explicitformula and a combinatorial formula for the second generalized hamming weightof an affine cartesian code.
