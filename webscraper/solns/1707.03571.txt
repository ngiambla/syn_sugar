massive multiple-input multiple-output (mimo) is one of the key technologiesin future generation networks. owing to their considerable spectral and energyefficiency gains, massive mimo systems provide the needed performance to copewith the ever increasing wireless capacity demand. nevertheless, the number ofscheduled users stays limited in massive mimo both in time division duplexing(tdd) and frequency division duplexing (fdd) systems. this is due to thelimited coherence time, in tdd systems, and to limited feedback capacity, infdd mode. in current systems, the time slot duration in tdd mode is the samefor all users. this is a suboptimal approach since users are subject toheterogeneous doppler spreads and, consequently, different coherence times. inthis paper, we investigate a massive mimo system operating in tdd mode inwhich, the frequency of uplink training differs among users based on theiractual channel coherence times. we argue that optimizing uplink training byexploiting this diversity can lead to considerable spectral efficiency gain. wethen provide a user scheduling algorithm that exploits a coherence intervalbased grouping in order to maximize the achievable weighted sum rate.
