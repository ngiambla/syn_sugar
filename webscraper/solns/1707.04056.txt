following roos, we say that a local ring $r$ is good if all finitelygenerated $r$-modules have rational poincar\'e series over $r$, sharing acommon denominator. rings with the backelin-roos property and generalised golodrings are good due to results of levin and avramov respectively. let $r$ be anartinian gorenstein local ring. the ring $r$ is shown to have the backelin-roosproperty if $r/ soc(r)$ is a golod ring. furthermore the ring $r$ isgeneralised golod if and only if $r/ soc(r)$ is so.  we explore when connected sums of artinian gorenstein local rings are good.we provide a uniform argument to show that stretched, almost stretchedgorenstein rings are good and show further that the auslander-reiten conjectureholds true for such rings. we prove that gorenstein rings of multiplicity atmost eleven are good. we recover a result of rossi-\c{s}ega on the goodproperty of compressed gorenstein local rings in a stronger form by a shorterargument.
