let $f$ be a rational map with degree $d\geq 2$ whose julia set is connectedbut not equal to the whole riemann sphere. it is proved that there exists arational map $g$ such that $g$ contains a buried julia component on which thedynamics is quasiconformally conjugate to that of $f$ on the julia set if andonly if $f$ does not have parabolic basins and siegel disks. if such $g$exists, then the degree can be chosen such that deg$(g)\leq 7d-2$. inparticular, if $f$ is a polynomial, then $g$ can be chosen such thatdeg$(g)\leq 4d+4$. moreover, some quartic and cubic rational maps whose juliasets contain buried jordan curves are also constructed.
