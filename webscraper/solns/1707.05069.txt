we construct a countably infinite simple rank $3$ matroid $m_*$ which$\wedge$-embeds every finite simple rank $3$ matroid, and such that everyisomorphism between finite $\wedge$-subgeometries of $m_*$ extends to anautomorphism of $m_*$. we prove that $m_*$ is not $\aleph_0$-categorical, ithas the independence property, it admits a stationary independence relation,and that $aut(m_*)$ embeds the symmetric group $sym(\omega)$. finally, we usethe free projective extension of $m_*$ to conclude the existence of a countablyinfinite projective plane embedding all the finite simple rank $3$ matroids andwhose automorphism group contains $sym(\omega)$.
