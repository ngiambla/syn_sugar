we consider energy-constrained infinite-dimensional quantum channels from agiven system (satisfying a certain condition) to any other systems. we showthat dealing with basic capacities of these channels we may assume (acceptingarbitrarily small error $\varepsilon$) that all channels have the samefinite-dimensional input space -- the subspace corresponding to the$m(\varepsilon)$ minimal eigenvalues of the input hamiltonian.  we also show that for the class of energy-limited channels (mappingenergy-bounded states to energy-bounded states) the above result is valid withsubstantially smaller dimension $m(\varepsilon)$.  the uniform finite-dimensional approximation allows to prove the uniformcontinuity of the basic capacities on the set of all quantum channels withrespect to the strong (pointwise) convergence topology. for all the capacitieswe obtain continuity bounds depending only on the input energy bound and theenergy-constrained-diamond-norm distance between quantum channels (generatingthe strong convergence on the set of quantum channels).
