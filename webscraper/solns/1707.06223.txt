let $a,b,c,d,e,f\in\mathbb n$ with $a\ge c\ge e>0$, $b\le a$ and $b\equiva\pmod2$, $d\le c$ and $d\equiv c\pmod2$, $f\le e$ and $f\equiv e\pmod2$. ifany nonnegative integer can be written as $x(ax+b)/2+y(cy+d)/2+z(ez+f)/2$ with$x,y,z\in\mathbb z$, then the tuple $(a,b,c,d,e,f)$ is said to be universalover $\mathbb z$. recently, z.-w. sun found all candidates of such universaltuples over $\mathbb z$. in this paper, we use the theory of ternary quadraticforms to show that 47 concrete tuples $(a,b,c,d,e,f)$ in sun's list ofcandidates are indeed universal over $\mathbb z$. for example, we prove theuniversality of $(16,4,2,0,1,1)$ over $\mathbb z$ which is related to thesophisticated form $x^2+y^2+32z^2$.
