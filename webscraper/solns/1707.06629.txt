we explore a web of connections between quantum entanglement and knot theoryby examining how topological entanglement entropy probes the braiding data ofquasi-particles in chern-simons theory, mainly using $su(2)$ gauge group as ourworking example. the problem of determining the renyi entropy is mapped tocomputing the expectation value of an auxiliary wilson loop in $s^3$ for eachbraid. we study various properties of this auxiliary wilson loop for some2-strand and 3-strand braids, and demonstrate how they reflect some geometricalproperties of the underlying braids.
