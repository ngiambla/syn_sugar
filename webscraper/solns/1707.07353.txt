consider a (possibly big) silting object $u$ in a derived category over a(dg-)algebra $a$. under some fairly general appropriate hypotheses, we showthat it induces derived equivalences between the derived category over $a$ anda localization of the derived category of dg-endomorphism algebra $b$ of $u$.if, in addition, $u$ is small then this localization is the whole derivedcategory over $b$.
