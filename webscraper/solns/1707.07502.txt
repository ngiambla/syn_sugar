the "mahler volume" is, intuitively speaking, a measure of how "round" acentrally symmetric convex body is. in one direction this intuition is givenweight by a result of santalo, who in the 1940s showed that the mahler volumeis maximized, in a given dimension, by the unit sphere and its linear images,and only these. a counterpart to this result in the opposite direction isproposed by a conjecture, formulated by kurt mahler in the 1930s and still openin dimensions 4 and greater, asserting that the mahler volume should beminimized by a cuboid. in this article we present a seemingly new proof of the2-dimensional case of this conjecture via the probabilistic method. the centralidea is to show that either deleting a random pair of edges from a centrallysymmetric convex polygon, or deleting a random pair of vertices, reduces themahler volume with positive probability.
