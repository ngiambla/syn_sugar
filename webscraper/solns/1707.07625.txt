numerical (and experimental) data analysis often requires the restoration ofa smooth function from a set of sampled integrals over finite bins. we presentthe bin hierarchy method that efficiently computes the maximally smoothfunction from the sampled integrals using essentially all the informationcontained in the data. we perform extensive tests with different classes offunctions and levels of data quality, including monte carlo data suffering froma severe sign problem.
