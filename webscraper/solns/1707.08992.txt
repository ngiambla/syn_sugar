we present an introduction to periodic and stochastic homogenization ofellip- tic partial differential equations. the first part is concerned with thequalitative theory, which we present for equations with periodic and randomcoefficients in a unified approach based on tartar's method of oscillating testfunctions. in partic- ular, we present a self-contained and elementary argumentfor the construction of the sublinear corrector of stochastic homogenization.(the argument also applies to elliptic systems and in particular to linearelasticity). in the second part we briefly discuss the representation of thehomogenization error by means of a two- scale expansion. in the last part wediscuss some results of quantitative stochastic homogenization in a discretesetting. in particular, we discuss the quantification of ergodicity viaconcentration inequalities, and we illustrate that the latter in combi- nationwith elliptic regularity theory leads to a quantification of the growth of thesublinear corrector and the homogenization error.
