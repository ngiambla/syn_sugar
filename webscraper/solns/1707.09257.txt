we define spatial $l^p$ af algebras for $p \in [1, \infty) \setminus \{ 2\}$, and prove the following analog of the elliott af algebra classificationtheorem. if $a$ and $b$ are spatial $l^p$ af algebras, then the following areequivalent: 1) $a$ and $b$ have isomorphic scaled preordered $k_0$-groups. 2)$a \cong b$ as rings. 3) $a \cong b$ (not necessarily isometrically) as banachalgebras. 4) $a$ is isometrically isomorphic to $b$ as banach algebras. 5) $a$is completely isometrically isomorphic to $b$ as matrix normed banach algebra.as background, we develop the theory of matrix normed $l^p$ operator algebras,and show that there is a unique way to make a spatial $l^p$ af algebra into amatrix normed $l^p$ operator algebra. we also show that any countable scaledriesz group can be realized as the scaled preordered $k_0$-group of a spatial$l^p$ af algebra.
