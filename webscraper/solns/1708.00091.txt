we introduce a category of stochastic maps (certain markov kernels) oncompact hausdorff spaces, construct a stochastic analogue of the gelfandspectrum functor, and prove a stochastic version of the commutativegelfand-naimark theorem. this relates concepts from algebra and operator theoryto concepts from topology and probability theory. for completeness, we reviewstochastic matrices, their relationship to positive maps on commutative$c^*$-algebras, and the gelfand-naimark theorem. no knowledge of probabilitytheory nor $c^*$-algebras is assumed and several examples are drawn fromphysics.
