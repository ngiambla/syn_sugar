in this paper we consider the isentropic compressible euler equations in twospace dimensions together with particular initial data. the latter consistsonly of two constant states, where one state lies on the lower and the otherstate on the upper half plane. the aim is to investigate if there exists aunique entropy solution or if the convex integration method produces infinitelymany entropy solutions. for some initial states this question has been answeredby e. feireisl and o. kreml, and also g.-q. chen and j. chen, where thereexists a unique entropy solution. for other initial states e. chiodaroli, o.kreml and c. de lellis showed that there are infinitely many entropy solutions.for still other initial states the question on uniqueness remained open andthis will be the content of this paper. this paper can be seen as a completionof the aforementioned papers by showing that the solution is non-unique in allcases (except if the solution is smooth).
