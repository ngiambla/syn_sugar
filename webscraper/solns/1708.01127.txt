consider a space $x$, such as a compact space of $j$-holomorphic stable maps,that is the zero set of a kuranishi atlas. this note explains how to define thevirtual fundamental class of $x$ by representing $x$ via the zero set of a map$s_m: m\to e$, where $e$ is a finite dimensional vector space and the domain$m$ is an oriented, weighted branched topological manifold. moreover, $s_m$ isequivariant under the action of the global isotropy group $\gamma$ on $m$ and$e$. this tuple $(m,e, \gamma, s_m)$ together with a homeomorphism$s_m^{-1}(0)/\gamma \to x$ forms a single finite dimensional model (or chart)for $x$. the construction assumes only that the atlas satisfies a topologicalversion of the index condition that can be obtained from a standard, ratherthan a smooth, gluing theorem. however if $x$ is presented as the zero set ofan sc-fredholm operator on a strong polyfold bundle, we outline a much moredirect construction of the branched manifold $m$ that uses an sc-smoothpartition of unity.
