for a discrete metric space (or more generally a large scale space) $x$ andan action of a group $g$ on $x$ by coarse equivalences, we define a type ofcoarse quotient space $x_g$, which agrees up to coarse equivalence with theorbit space $x/g$ when $g$ is finite. we then restrict our attention to what wecall coarsely discontinuous actions and show that for such actions the group$g$ can be recovered as an appropriately defined automorphism group$\mathsf{aut}(x/x_g)$ when $x$ satisfies a large scale connectedness condition.we show that for a coarsely discontinuous action of a countable group $g$ on adiscrete bounded geometry metric space $x$ there is a relation between themaximal roe algebras of $x$ and $x_g$, namely that there is a$\ast$-isomorphism $c^\ast_{\max}(x_g)/\mathcal{k} \congc^\ast_{\max}(x)/\mathcal{k} \rtimes g$, where $\mathcal{k}$ is the ideal ofcompact operators. if $x$ has property a and $g$ is amenable, then we show that$x_g$ has property a, and thus the maximal roe algebra and full crossed productcan be replaced by the usual roe algebra and reduced crossed productrespectively in the above equation.
