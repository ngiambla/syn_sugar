we provide explicit equations of some smooth complex quartic surfaces withmany lines, including all 10 quartics with more than 52 lines. we study therelation between linear automorphisms and some configurations of lines such astwin lines and special lines. we answer a question by oguiso on a determinantalpresentation of the fermat quartic surface.
