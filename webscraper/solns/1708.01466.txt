this paper proposes a highly accurate algorithm to estimate thesignal-to-noise ratio (snr) for a linear system from a single realization ofthe received signal. we assume that the linear system has a gaussian matrixwith one sided left correlation. the unknown entries of the signal and thenoise are assumed to be independent and identically distributed with zero meanand can be drawn from any distribution. we use the ridge regression function ofthis linear model in company with tools and techniques adapted from randommatrix theory to achieve, in closed form, accurate estimation of the snrwithout prior statistical knowledge on the signal or the noise. simulationresults are provided, and show that the proposed method is very accurate.
