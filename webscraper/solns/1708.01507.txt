we obtain a structure theorem for the group of holomorphic automorphisms of aconformally k\"ahler, einstein-maxwell metric, extending the classical resultsof matsushima, licherowicz and calabi in the k\"ahler-einstein, csck, andextremal k\"ahler cases. combined with previous results of lebrun,apostolov-maschler and futaki-ono, this completes the classification of theconformally k\"ahler, einstein--maxwell metrics on $\mathbb{{cp}}^1 \times\mathbb{{cp}}^1$. we also use our result in order to introduce a (relative)mabuchi energy in the more general context of $(k, q, a)$-extremal k\"ahlermetrics in a given k\"ahler class, and show that the existence of $(k, q,a)$-extremal k\"ahler metrics is stable under small deformation of the k\"ahlerclass, the killing vector field $k$ and the normalization constant $a$.
