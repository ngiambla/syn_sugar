in this work is presented a study on matrix biorthogonal polynomialssequences that satisfy a nonsymmetric recurrence relation with unboundedcoefficients. the ratio asymptotic for this family of matrix biorthogonalpolynomials is derived in quite general assumptions. it is considered someillustrative examples.
