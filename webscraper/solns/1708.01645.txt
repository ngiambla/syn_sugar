we study a question which has natural interpretations in both quantummechanics and in geometry. let $v_1,..., v_n$ be complex vector spaces ofdimension $d_1,...,d_n$ and let $g= sl_{d_1} \times \dots \times sl_{d_n}$.geometrically, we ask given $(d_1,...,d_n)$, when is the geometric invarianttheory quotient $\mathbb{p}(v_1 \otimes \dots \otimes v_n)// g$ non-empty? thisis equivalent to the quantum mechanical question of whether the multipartquantum system with hilbert space $v_1\otimes \dots \otimes v_n$ has a locallymaximally entangled state, i.e. a state such that the density matrix for eachelementary subsystem is a multiple of the identity. we show that the answer tothis question is yes if and only if $r(d_1,...,d_n)\geqslant 0$ where \[r(d_1,...,d_n) = \prod_i d_i +\sum_{k=1}^n (-1)^k \sum_{1\leq i_1<\dotsb<i_k\leq n} (\gcd(d_{i_1},\dotsc ,d_{i_k}) )^{2}. \] we also provide a simplerecursive algorithm which determines the answer to the question, and we computethe dimension of the resulting quotient in the non-empty cases.
