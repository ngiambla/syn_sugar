for a graph $g$, we associate a family of real symmetric matrices,$\mathcal{s}(g)$, where for any $m \in \mathcal{s}(g)$, the location of thenonzero off-diagonal entries of $m$ are governed by the adjacency structure of$g$. the ordered multiplicity inverse eigenvalue problem of a graph (iepg) isconcerned with finding all attainable ordered lists of eigenvaluemultiplicities for matrices in $\mathcal{s}(g)$.  for connected graphs of order six, we offer significant progress on the iepg,as well as a complete solution to the ordered multiplicity iepg. we also showthat while $k_{m,n}$ with $\min(m,n)\ge 3$ attains a particular orderedmultiplicity list, it cannot do so with arbitrary spectrum.
