the canonical join complex of a semidistributive lattice is a simplicialcomplex whose faces are canonical join representations of elements of thesemidistributive lattice. we give a combinatorial classification of the facesof the canonical join complex of the lattice of biclosed sets of segmentssupported by a tree, as introduced by the third author and mcconville. we alsouse our classification to describe the elements of the shard intersection orderof the lattice of biclosed sets. as a consequence, we prove that this shardintersection order is a lattice.
