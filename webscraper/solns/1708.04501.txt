a classical difficult isomorphism testing problem is to test isomorphism ofp-groups of class 2 and exponent p in time polynomial in the group order. it isknown that this problem can be reduced to solving the alternating matrix spaceisometry problem over a finite field in time polynomial in the underlyingvector space size. we propose a venue of attack for the latter problem byviewing it as a linear algebraic analogue of the graph isomorphism problem.this viewpoint leads us to explore the possibility of transferring techniquesfor graph isomorphism to this long-believed bottleneck case of groupisomorphism.  in 1970's, babai, erd\h{o}s, and selkow presented the first average-caseefficient graph isomorphism testing algorithm (siam j computing, 1980).inspired by that algorithm, we devise an average-case efficient algorithm forthe alternating matrix space isometry problem over a key range of parameters,in a random model of alternating matrix spaces in vein of the erd\h{o}s-r\'enyimodel of random graphs. for this, we develop a linear algebraic analogue of theclassical individualisation technique, a technique belonging to a set ofcombinatorial techniques that has been critical for the progress on theworst-case time complexity for graph isomorphism, but was missing in the groupisomorphism context. as a consequence of the main algorithm, we establish aweaker linear algebraic analogue of erd\h{o}s and r\'enyi's classical resultthat most graphs have the trivial automorphism group. we finally show thatluks' dynamic programming technique for graph isomorphism (stoc 1999) can beadapted to slightly improve the worst-case time complexity of the alternatingmatrix space isometry problem in a certain range of parameters.
