in this paper, we model a stackelberg game in a simple gaussian test channelwhere a human transmitter (leader) communicates a source message to a humanreceiver (follower). we model human decision making using prospect theorymodels proposed for continuous decision spaces. assuming that the valuefunction is the squared distortion at both the transmitter and the receiver, weanalyze the effects of the weight functions at both the transmitter and thereceiver on optimal communication strategies, namely encoding at thetransmitter and decoding at the receiver, in the stackelberg sense. we showthat the optimal strategies for the behavioral agents in the stackelberg senseare identical to those designed for unbiased agents. at the same time, we alsoshow that the prospect-theoretic distortions at both the transmitter and thereceiver are both larger than the expected distortion, thus making behavioralagents less contended than unbiased agents. consequently, the presence ofcognitive biases increases the need for transmission power in order to achievea given distortion at both transmitter and receiver.
