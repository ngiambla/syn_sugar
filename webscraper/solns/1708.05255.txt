we introduce a categorical language in which it is possible to talk about dnasequencing, alignment methods, crispr, homologous recombination, haplotypes,and genetic linkage. this language takes the form of a class of limit-sketcheswhose categories of models can model different concepts of biology depending onwhat their categories of values are. we discuss examples of models in thecategory of sets and in the category of modules over the boolean semi-ring$\{0,1\}$. we identify a subclass of models in sets that models the geneticmaterial of living beings and another subclass of models in modules that modelshaplotypes. we show how the two classes are related via a universal property.
