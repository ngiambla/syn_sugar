fractional partial differential equations with distributed-order fractionalderivatives describe some important physical phenomena. in this paper, wepropose a local discontinuous galerkin (ldg) method for the distributed-ordertime and riesz space fractional convection-diffusion and schr\"odinger typeequations. we prove stability and optimal order of convergence$o(h^{n+1}+(\delta t)^{1+\frac{\theta}{2}}+\theta^{2})$ for thedistributed-order time and space-fractional diffusion and schr\"odinger typeequations, an order of convergence of $o(h^{n+\frac{1}{2}}+(\deltat)^{1+\frac{\theta}{2}}+\theta^{2})$ is established for the distributed-ordertime and riesz space fractional convection-diffusion equations where $\deltat$, $h$ and $\theta$ are the step sizes in time, space and distributed-ordervariables, respectively. finally, the performed numerical experiments confirmthe optimal order of convergence.
