according to quantum mechanics, the informational content of isolated systemsdoes not change in time. however, subadditivity of entropy seems to describe anexcess of information when we look at single parts of a composite systems andtheir correlations. moreover, the balance between the entropic contributionscoming from the various parts is not conserved under unitary transformations.reasoning on the basic concept of quantum mechanics, we find that in such apicture an important term has been overlooked: the intrinsic quantuminformation encoded in the coherence of pure states. to fill this gap we areled to define a quantity, that we call coherent entropy, which is necessary toaccount for the "missing" information and for re-establishing its conservation.interestingly, the coherent entropy is found to be equal to the informationconveyed in the future by quantum states. the perspective outlined in thispaper may be of some inspiration in several fields, from foundations of quantummechanics to black-hole physics.
