we address the problem of studying multiparameter quamtum groups (=mpqg's) atroots of unity, namely quantum universal enveloping algebras $u_{\boldsymbol{\rm q}}(\mathfrak{g}) $ depending on a matrix of parameters $\boldsymbol{\rm q} = {\big( q_{ij} \big)}_{i, j \in i} \, $. this is performedvia the construction of quantum root vectors and suitable "integral forms" of $u_{\boldsymbol{\rm q}}(\mathfrak{g}) \, $, a restricted one - generated byquantum divided powers and quantum binomial coefficients - and an unrestrictedone - where quantum root vectors are suitably renormalized. the specializationsat roots of unity of either forms are the "mpqg's at roots of unity" we areinvestigating. in particular, we study special subalgebras and quotients of ourmpqg's at roots of unity - namely, the multiparameter version of small quantumgroups - and suitable associated quantum frobenius morphisms, that link the(specializations of) mpqg's at roots of 1 with mpqg's at 1, the latter beingclassical hopf algebras bearing a well precise poisson-geometrical content. akey point in the discussion - often at the core of our strategy - is that everympqg is actually a 2-cocycle deformation of the algebra structure of (a liftof) the "canonical" one-parameter quantum group by jimbo-lusztig, so that wecan often rely on already established results available for the latter. on theother hand, depending on the chosen multiparameter $ \boldsymbol{\rm q} $ ourquantum groups yield - through the choice of integral forms and theirspecialization - different semiclassical structures, namely different liecoalgebra structures and poisson structures on the lie algebra and algebraicgroup underlying the canonical one-parameter quantum group.
