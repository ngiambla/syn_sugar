in this paper, we present some extensions of interpolation between thearithmetic-geometric means inequality. among other inequalities, it is shownthat if $a, b, x$ are $n\times n$ matrices, then \begin{align*}\|axb^*\|^2\leq\|f_1(a^*a)xg_1(b^*b)\|\,\|f_2(a^*a)xg_2(b^*b)\|, \end{align*}where $f_1,f_2,g_1,g_2$ are non-negative continues functions such that$f_1(t)f_2(t)=t$ and $g_1(t)g_2(t)=t\,\,(t\geq0)$. we also obtain theinequality \begin{align*}\left|\left|\left|ab^*\right|\right|\right|^2\nonumber&\leq\left|\left|\left|p(a^*a)^{\frac{m}{p}}+(1-p)(b^*b)^{\frac{s}{1-p}}\right|\right|\right|\,\left|\left|\left|(1-p)(a^*a)^{\frac{n}{1-p}}+p(b^*b)^{\frac{t}{p}}\right|\right|\right|, \end{align*} in which $m,n,s,t$ arereal numbers such that $m+n=s+t=1$, $|||\cdot|||$ is an arbitrary unitarilyinvariant norm and $p\in[0,1]$.
