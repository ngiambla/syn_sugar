in phase retrieval we want to recover an unknown signal $\boldsymbolx\in\mathbb c^d$ from $n$ quadratic measurements of the form $y_i =|\langle{\boldsymbol a}_i,{\boldsymbol x}\rangle|^2+w_i$ where $\boldsymbola_i\in \mathbb c^d$ are known sensing vectors and $w_i$ is measurement noise.we ask the following weak recovery question: what is the minimum number ofmeasurements $n$ needed to produce an estimator $\hat{\boldsymbolx}(\boldsymbol y)$ that is positively correlated with the signal $\boldsymbolx$? we consider the case of gaussian vectors $\boldsymbol a_i$. we prove that -in the high-dimensional limit - a sharp phase transition takes place, and welocate the threshold in the regime of vanishingly small noise. for $n\led-o(d)$ no estimator can do significantly better than random and achieve astrictly positive correlation. for $n\ge d+o(d)$ a simple spectral estimatorachieves a positive correlation. surprisingly, numerical simulations with thesame spectral estimator demonstrate promising performance with realisticsensing matrices. spectral methods are used to initialize non-convexoptimization algorithms in phase retrieval, and our approach can boost theperformance in this setting as well.  our impossibility result is based on classical information-theory arguments.the spectral algorithm computes the leading eigenvector of a weighted empiricalcovariance matrix. we obtain a sharp characterization of the spectralproperties of this random matrix using tools from free probability andgeneralizing a recent result by lu and li. both the upper and lower boundgeneralize beyond phase retrieval to measurements $y_i$ produced according to ageneralized linear model. as a byproduct of our analysis, we compare thethreshold of the proposed spectral method with that of a message passingalgorithm.
