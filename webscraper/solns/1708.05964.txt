in this paper we consider the fractional differentiation operators in avariety of senses. we show that the strong accretive property is the commonproperty of fractional differentiation operators. also we prove that thesectorial property holds for operators second order with fractional derivativein lower terms, we explore the location of spectrum and resolvent sets and showthat the real component has a discrete spectrum. we prove that there istwo-sided estimate for eigenvalues of real component of operators second orderwith fractional derivative in lower terms.
