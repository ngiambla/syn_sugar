given a module $m$ for the algebra $\mathcal{d}_{\mathtt{q}}(g)$ of quantumdifferential operators on $g$, and a positive integer $n$, we may equip thespace $f_n^g(m)$ of invariant tensors in $v^{\otimes n}\otimes m$, with anaction of the double affine hecke algebra of type $a_{n-1}$. here $g= sl_n$ or$gl_n$, and $v$ is the $n$-dimensional defining representation of $g$.  in this paper we take $m$ to be the basic$\mathcal{d}_{\mathtt{q}}(g)$-module, i.e. the quantized coordinate algebra $m=\mathcal{o}_{\mathtt{q}}(g)$. we describe a weight basis for$f_n^g(\mathcal{o}_{\mathtt{q}}(g))$ combinatorially in terms of walks in thetype $a$ weight lattice, and standard periodic tableaux, and subsequentlyidentify $f_n^g(\mathcal{o}_{\mathtt{q}}(g))$ with the irreducible "rectangularrepresentation" of height $n$ of the double affine hecke algebra.
