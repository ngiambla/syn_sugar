in this paper, hypocoercivity methods are applied to linear kinetic equationswith mass conservation and without confinement, in order to prove that thelong-time behavior has algebraic decay as in the case of the heat equation. twoalternative approaches are developed: an analysis based on decoupled fouriermodes and a direct approach where, instead of the poincar{\'e} inequality forthe dirichlet form, nash's inequality is employed. the first approach is alsoused to provide a proof of exponential decay to equilibrium on the flat torus.the results are obtained on a space with exponential weights and then extendedto larger function spaces by a factorization method. the optimality of therates is discussed. algebraic rates of decay on the whole space are alsoimproved when the initial datum has zero average.
