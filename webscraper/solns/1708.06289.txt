in this letter, two explicit self-similar solutions to a graph representationof time-like extremal hypersurfaces in minkowski spacetime $\mathbb{r}^{1+3}$are given. meanwhile, there is an untable eigenvalue in the linearizedtime-like extremal hypersurfaces equation around two explicit self-similarsolutions.
