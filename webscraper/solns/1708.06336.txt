approximate symbol error rate (ser) expressions are derived for receivediversity system employing optimum combining, when both the desired and theinterfering signals are subjected to rician fading, for the case of a) equalpower uncorrelated interferers b) unequal power interferers c) interferercorrelation. the derived expressions are applicable for an arbitrary number ofreceive antennas and interferers and for any qam constellation. furthermore, wederive a simple closed form expression for ser in the interference-limitedregime, for the special case of rayleigh faded interferers. a close match isobserved between the ser result obtained through the derived analyticalexpression and the one obtained from monte-carlo simulations, for a variety ofqam constellations.
