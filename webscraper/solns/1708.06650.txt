coded caching scheme has recently become quite popular in the wirelessnetwork due to the efficiency of reducing the load during peak traffic times.recently the most concern is the problem of subpacketization level in a codedcaching scheme. although there are several classes of constructions, theseschemes only apply to some individual cases for the memory size. and in thepractice it is very crucial to consider any memory size. in this paper, fourclasses of new schemes with the wide range of memory size are constructed. andthrough the performance analyses, our new scheme can significantly reduce thelevel of subpacketization by decreasing a little efficiency of transmission inthe peak traffic times. moreover some schemes satisfy that the packet number ispolynomial or linear with the number of users.
