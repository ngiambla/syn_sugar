in this paper we consider the problem of finding periodic solutions ofcertain euler-lagrange equations, which include, among others, equationsinvolving the $p$-laplace and, more generality, the $(p,q)$-laplace operator.we employ the direct method of the calculus of variations in the framework ofanisotropic orlicz-sobolev spaces. these spaces appear to be useful informulating a unified theory of existence for the type of problem considered.
