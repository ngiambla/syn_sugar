the local gan-gross-prasad conjecture of unitary groups, which is now settledby the works of plessis, gan and ichino, says that for a pair of generic$l$-parameters of $(u(n+1),u(n))$, there is a unique pair of representations intheir associated vogan $l$-packets which produces the bessel model. in thispaper, we examined the conjecture for a pair of $l$-parameters of $\big(u(n+1),u(n)\big)$ as fixing a special non-generic parameter of $u(n+1)$ and varingtempered $l$-parameters of $u(n)$. we observed that there still exist agan-gross-prasad type formulae depending on the choice of $l$-parameter of$u(n)$.
