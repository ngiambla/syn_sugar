the internal size of an object $m$ inside a given category is, roughly, theleast infinite cardinal $\lambda$ such that any morphism from $m$ into thecolimit of a $\lambda^+$-directed system factors through one of the componentsof the system. the existence spectrum of a category is the class of cardinals$\lambda$ such that the category has an object of internal size $\lambda$. westudy the existence spectrum in $\mu$-abstract elementary classes ($\mu$-aecs),which are, up to equivalence of categories, the same as accessible categorieswith all morphisms monomorphisms. we show for example that, assuming instancesof the singular cardinal hypothesis which follow from a large cardinal axiom,$\mu$-aecs which admit intersections have objects of all sufficiently largeinternal sizes. we also investigate the relationship between internal sizes andcardinalities and analyze a series of examples, including one of shelah---acertain class of sufficiently-closed constructible models of set theory---whichshow that the categoricity spectrum can behave very differently depending onwhether we look at categoricity in cardinalities or in internal sizes.
