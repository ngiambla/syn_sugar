we prove berry-esseen type rates of convergence for central limit theorems(clts) of regenerative processes which generalize previous results ofbolthausen under weaker moment assumptions. we then show how this generalresult can be applied to obtain rates of convergence for (1) clts for additivefunctionals of positive recurrent markov chains under certain conditions on thestrong mixing coefficients, and (2) annealed clts for certain ballistic randomwalks in random environments.
