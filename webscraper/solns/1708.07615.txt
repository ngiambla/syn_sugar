we examine recursive monotonic functions on the lindenbaum algebra of$\mathsf{ea}$. we prove that no such function sends every consistent $\varphi$to a sentence with deductive strength strictly between $\varphi$ and$(\varphi\wedge\mathsf{con}(\varphi))$. we generalize this result to iteratesof consistency into the effective transfinite. we then prove that for anyrecursive monotonic function $f$, if there is an iterate of $\mathsf{con}$ thatbounds $f$ everywhere, then $f$ must be somewhere equal to an iterate of$\mathsf{con}$.
