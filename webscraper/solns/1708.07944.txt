we present a difference analogue of a result on specializations ofdifferential galois groups given by hrushovski. let $k$ be a field ofcharacteristic zero and let $d$ be a finitely generated domain over $k$.consider the linear difference equation $$  \sigma(y)=ay $$ where $a$ is an invertible matrix with entries in the fieldof fractions of $d[x]$ and $\sigma$ is a shift operator $\sigma(x)=x+1$. weprove that the set of $k$-homomorphisms $\varphi$ from $d$ to $\bar{k}$ underwhich the galois group of $\sigma(y)=ay$ specializes to the galois group of$\sigma(y)=\varphi(a)y$ over $\bar{k}(x)$ is not empty, and if $d$ istranscendental over $k$ then this set is infinite.  we apply our result to van der put-singer conjecture which asserts that analgebraic subgroup $g$ of $\mathrm{gl}_n(\bar{k})$ is the galois group of alinear difference equation over $\bar{k}(x)$ if and only if the quotient$g/g^\circ$ by the identity component is cyclic. we show that if van derput-singer conjecture is true for $\bar{k}=\mathbb{c}$ then it will be true for$\bar{k}$ to be any algebraically closed field of characteristic zero.
