in the paper, we study the three-dimensional prandtl equations, and provethat if one component of the tangential velocity field satisfies themonotonicity assumption in the normal direction, then the system is locallywell-posed in the gevrey function space with gevrey index in $]1, 2].$ theproof relies on some new cancellation mechanism in the system in addition tothose observed in the two-dimensional setting.
