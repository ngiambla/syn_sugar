this paper is concerned with resolvent estimates on the real axis for thehelmholtz equation posed in the exterior of a bounded obstacle with dirichletboundary conditions when the obstacle is trapping. there are two resolventestimates for this situation currently in the literature: (i) in the case ofelliptic trapping the general "worst case" bound of exponential growth applies,and examples show that this growth can be realised through some sequence ofwavenumbers; (ii) in the prototypical case of hyperbolic trapping where thehelmholtz equation is posed in the exterior of two strictly convex obstacles(or several obstacles with additional constraints) the nontrapping resolventestimate holds with a logarithmic loss.  this paper proves the first resolvent estimate for parabolic trapping byobstacles, studying a class of obstacles the prototypical example of which isthe exterior of two squares (in 2-d), or two cubes (in 3-d), whose sides areparallel. we show, via a novel application of thevector-field/positive-commutator argument of morawetz, that a resolventestimate holds with a polynomial loss over the nontrapping estimate. we usethis bound, along with the other trapping resolvent estimates, to prove resultsabout integral-equation formulations of the boundary value problem in the caseof trapping, and to obtain convergence proofs for standard numerical methods(finite and boundary element methods) applied to these problems; these are thefirst wavenumber-explicit proofs of convergence for any numerical method forsolving the helmholtz equation in the exterior of a trapping obstacle.
