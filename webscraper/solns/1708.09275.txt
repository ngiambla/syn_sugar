let $r$ be a ring of characteristic $0$ with field of fractions $k$, and let$m\ge2$. the b\"ottcher coordinate of a power series $\varphi(x)\in x^m +x^{m+1}r[\![x]\!]$ is the unique power series $f_\varphi(x)\in x+x^2k[\![x]\!]$satisfying $\varphi\circ f_\varphi(x) = f_\varphi(x^m)$. in this paper we studythe integrality properties of the coefficients of $f_\varphi(x)$, partly fortheir intrinsic interest and partly for potential applications to $p$-adicdynamics. results include: (1) if $p$ is prime and $r=\mathbb z_p$ and$\varphi(x)\in x^p + px^{p+1}r[\![x]\!]$, then $f_\varphi(x)\in r[\![x]\!]$.(2) if $\varphi(x)\in x^m + mx^{m+1}r[\![x]\!]$, then$f_\varphi(x)=x\sum_{k=0}^\infty a_kx^k/k!$ with all $a_k\in r$. (3) in (2), if$m=p^2$, then $a_k\equiv-1\pmod{p}$ for all $k$ that are powers of $p$.
