in this paper we study quantum stochastic differential equations (qsdes) thatare driven by strongly squeezed vacuum noise. we show that for strong squeezingsuch a qsde can be approximated (via a limit in the strong sense) by a qsdethat is driven by a single commuting noise process. we find that theapproximation has an additional hamiltonian term.
