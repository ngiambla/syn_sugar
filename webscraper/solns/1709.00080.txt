we prove that, under certain conditions on the function pair $\varphi_1$ and$\varphi_2$, bilinear average $p^{-1}\sum_{y\in\mathbb{f}_p}f_1(x+\varphi_1(y)) f_2(x+\varphi_2(y))$ along curve $(\varphi_1,\varphi_2)$ satisfies certain decay estimate. as a consequence, roth typetheorems hold in the setting of finite fields. in particular, if$\varphi_1,\varphi_2\in \mathbb{f}_p[x]$ with $\varphi_1(0)=\varphi_2(0)=0$ arelinearly independent polynomials, then for any $a\subset \mathbb{f}_p,|a|=\delta p$ with $\delta>c p^{-\frac{1}{12}}$, there are $\gtrsim\delta^3p^2$ triplets $x,x+\varphi_1(y), x+\varphi_2(y)\in a$. this extends arecent result of bourgain and chang who initiated this type of problems, andstrengthens the bound in a result of peluse, who generalized bourgain andchang's work. the proof uses discrete fourier analysis and algebraic geometry.
