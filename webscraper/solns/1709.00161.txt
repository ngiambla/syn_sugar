in this paper we introduce the algebraic formulation for group field theoryand study non-fock (condensate) representations based on coherent states. weshow that we can construct representation with infinite number of particles ingroup field theories on compact base manifolds, similarly to what one can do onnon-compact manifolds. we also show that the constructed representations breaktranslation symmetry. since such representations describe quantum gravitysystems with infinite number of fundamental pre-geometric building blocks, theycan be more suitable for description of effective spatiotemporal phases of thetheory.
