we present an analysis of the additive average schwarz preconditioner withtwo newly proposed adaptively enriched coarse spaces which was presented at the23rd international conference on domain decomposition methods in korea, forsolving second order elliptic problems with highly varying and discontinuouscoefficients. it is shown that the condition number of the preconditionedsystem is bounded independently of the variations and the jumps in thecoefficient, and depends linearly on the mesh parameter ratio h/h, that is theratio between the subdomain size and the mesh size, thereby retaining the sameoptimality and scalablity of the original additive average schwarzpreconditioner.
