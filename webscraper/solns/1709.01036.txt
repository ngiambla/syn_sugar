we show that the random number $t_n$ of triangles in a random graph on $n$vertices, with a strict constraint on the total number of edges, admits anexpansion $t_n = an^3 + bn^2 + f_n$, where $a$ and $b$ are numbers, with themean $\langle f_n \rangle = o(n)$ and the standard deviation $\sigma(t_n)=\sigma(f_n)= o(n^{3/2})$. the presence of a `surface term' $bn^2$ has asignificance analogous to the macroscopic surface effects of materials, and ismissing in the model where the edge constraint is removed. we also find thesurface effect in other graph models using similar edge constraints.
