this paper introduces a skew variant of the notion of enriched category,suitable for enrichment over a skew-monoidal category, the main novelty ofwhich is that the elements of the enriched hom-objects need not be in bijectionwith the morphisms of the underlying category. this is the natural setting inwhich to introduce the notion of locally weak comonad, which is fundamental tothe theory of enriched algebraic weak factorisation systems. the equivalence,for a monoidal closed category $\mathcal{v}$, between tensored$\mathcal{v}$-categories and hommed $\mathcal{v}$-actegories is extended to theskew setting and easily proved by recognising both skew$\mathcal{v}$-categories and skew $\mathcal{v}$-actegories as equivalent tospecial kinds of skew $\mathcal{v}$-proactegory.
