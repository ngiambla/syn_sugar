we show here that from the metric of the manifold $m^0_2$, i.e., the reducedmoduli of $su(2)$ 2-monopoles in yang-mills-higgs theory, one can recover therespective moduli of spectral curves and we claim that this process can be doneconversely to find the metric of $m^0_k$ , $k >2$. in this case,the methodgauss-manin connection in disguise will show that the metric of $m^0_k$ can bewritten in terms of modular-type functions attached to the spectral curves.this is a thirty years old problem that we hope to shed some light in it.
