let $x$ be a first countable space which admits a non-trivial convergentsequence and let $\mathcal{i}$ be an analytic p-ideal. first, it is shown thatthe sets of $\mathcal{i}$-limit points of all sequences in $x$ are closed ifand only if $\mathcal{i}$ is also an $f_\sigma$-ideal.  moreover, let $(x_n)$ be a sequence taking values in a polish space withoutisolated points. it is known that the set $a$ of its statistical limit pointsis an $f_\sigma$-set, the set $b$ of its statistical cluster points is closed,and that the set $c$ of its ordinary limit points is closed, with $a\subseteqb\subseteq c$. it is proved the sets $a$ and $b$ own some additionalrelationship: indeed, the set $s$ of isolated points of $b$ is contained alsoin $a$. conversely, if $a$ is an $f_\sigma$-set, $b$ is a closed set with asubset $s$ of isolated points such that $b\setminus s\neq \emptyset$ is regularclosed, and $c$ is a closed set with $s\subseteq a\subseteq b\subseteq c$, thenthere exists a sequence $(x_n)$ for which: $a$ is the set of its statisticallimit points, $b$ is the set of its statistical cluster points, and $c$ is theset of its ordinary limit points.  lastly, we discuss topological nature of the set of $\mathcal{i}$-limitpoints when $\mathcal{i}$ is neither $f_\sigma$- nor analytic p-ideal.
