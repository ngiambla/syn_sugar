we prove nehari's theorem for integral hankel and toeplitz operators onsimple convex polytopes in several variables. a special case of the theorem,generalizing the boundedness criterion of the hankel and toeplitz operators onthe paley-wiener space, reads as follows. let $\xi = (0,1)^d$ be a$d$-dimensional cube, and for a distribution $f$ on $2\xi$, consider the hankeloperator  $$\gamma_f (g)(x)=\int_{\xi} f(x+y) g(y) \, dy, \quad x \in\xi.$$ then$\gamma_f$ extends to a bounded operator on $l^2(\xi)$ if and only if there isa bounded function $b$ on $\mathbb{r}^d$ whose fourier transform coincides with$f$ on $2\xi$. this special case has an immediate application in matrixextension theory: every finite multi-level block toeplitz matrix can beboundedly extended to an infinite multi-level block toeplitz matrix. inparticular, block toeplitz operators with blocks which are themselves toeplitz,can be extended to bounded infinite block toeplitz operators with toeplitzblocks.
