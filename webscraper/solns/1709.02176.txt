using the transmutation theory developed by majid in \cite{majid}, in thispaper we give an explicit formula for the m\"uger centralizer in the categoryof representations of a quasitriangular hopf algebra. a second formula for them\"uger centralizer is also given in terms of the conjugacy classes introducedby cohen and westreich in \cite{cw1}. this allows us to answer positively aquestion from \cite{mathz}. more precisely we show that in the case of afactorizable hopf algebra the centralizer of a normal fusion subcategory isalso a normal fusion subcategory. as an application we give a structure theoremfor factorizable hopf algebras of dimension $dq^{n}$ where $d$ is an oddsquare-free integer and $q$ an odd prime number.
