hadamard full propelinear codes (hfp-codes) are introduced and theirequivalence with hadamard groups is proven (on the other hand, it is alreadyknown the equivalence of hadamard groups with relative$(4n,2,4n,2n)$-difference sets in a group and also with cocyclic hadamardmatrices). we compute the available values for the rank and dimension of thekernel of hfp-codes of type q and we show that the dimension of the kernel isalways 1 or $2$. we also show that when the dimension of the kernel is 2 thenthe dimension of the kernel of the transposed code is 1 (so, both codes are notequivalent). finally, we give a construction method such that from an hfp-codeof length $4n$, dimension of the kernel $k=2$, and maximum rank $r=2n$, weobtain an hfp-code of double length $8n$, dimension of the kernel $k=2$, andmaximum rank $r=4n$.
