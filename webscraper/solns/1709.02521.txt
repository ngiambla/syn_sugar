we consider the action of $sl(2,\mathbb{r})$ on a vector bundle $\mathbf{h}$preserving an ergodic probability measure $\nu$ on the base $x$. under anirreducibility assumption on this action, we prove that if $\hat\nu$ is anylift of $\nu$ to a probability measure on the projectivized bunde$\mathbb{p}(\mathbf{h})$ that is invariant under the upper triangular subgroup,then $\hat \nu$ is supported in the projectivization $\mathbb{p}(\mathbf{e}_1)$of the top lyapunov subspace of the positive diagonal semigroup. we derive twoapplications. first, the lyapunov exponents for the kontsevich-zorich cocycledepend continuously on affine measures, answering a question in [mmy]. second,if $\mathbb{p}(\mathbf{v})$ is an irreducible, flat projective bundle over acompact hyperbolic surface $\sigma$, with hyperbolic foliation $\mathcal{f}$tangent to the flat connection, then the foliated horocycle flow on$t^1\mathcal{f}$ is uniquely ergodic if the top lyapunov exponent of thefoliated geodesic flow is simple. this generalizes results in [bg] to arbitrarydimension.
