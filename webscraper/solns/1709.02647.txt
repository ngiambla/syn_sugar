in this paper, we show that an embedding in euclidean space based on tropicalalgebraic geometry generates stable sufficient statistics for barcodes.conventionally, barcodes are multiscale summaries of topologicalcharacteristics that capture the "shape" of data; however, in practice, theyhave complex structures which make them difficult to use in statisticalsettings. the sufficiency result presented in this work allows for classicalprobability distributions to be assumed on the tropicalized representation ofbarcodes. this makes a variety of parametric statistical inference methodsamenable to barcodes, all while maintaining their initial interpretations. morespecifically, we show that exponential family distributions may be assumed, andthat likelihood functions for persistent homology may be constructed. weconceptually demonstrate sufficiency and illustrate its utility in persistenthomology dimensions 0 and 1 with concrete parametric applications to hiv andavian influenza data.
