we continue the theory of $\mathcal{t}$-systems from the work of the secondauthor, developing their categorical aspects, including a categorical theorywith formal negation, focusing on tensor products, ground systems, and modulesystems over a ground system (paralleling the theory of modules over analgebra). here abelian categories are replaced by semi-abelian categories(where hom($a,b$) is not a group) with a negation morphism. the theory is broadenough to encapsulate general algebraic structures lacking negation butpossessing a map resembling negation, such as tropical algebras, hyperfieldsand fuzzy rings.
