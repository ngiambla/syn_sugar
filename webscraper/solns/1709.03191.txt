the aim of atypicality is to extract small, rare, unusual and interestingpieces out of big data. this complements statistics about typical data to giveinsight into data. in order to find such "interesting" parts of data, universalapproaches are required, since it is not known in advance what we are lookingfor. we therefore base the atypicality criterion on codelength. in a priorpaper we developed the methodology for discrete-valued data, and the thecurrent paper extends this to real-valued data. this is done by using minimumdescription length (mdl). we show that this shares a number of theoreticalproperties with the discrete-valued case. we develop the methodology for anumber of "universal" signal processing models, and finally apply them torecorded hydrophone data.
