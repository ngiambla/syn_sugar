the orbit polytope for a finite group g acting linearly and freely on asphere s is used to construct a cellularized fundamental domain for the action.a resolution of the integers over g results from the associated g-equivariantcellularization of s. this technique is applied to the generalized binarytetrahedral group family; the homology groups, the cohomology rings and thereidemeister torsions of the related spherical space forms are determined.
