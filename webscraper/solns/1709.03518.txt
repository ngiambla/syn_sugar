we give an effective iterative characterization of the classes of (smooth,rational) (-1)-curves on the blowup of the projective plane at general points.such classes are characterized as having self-intersection -1, arithmetic genus0, and intersecting every (-1)-curve of smaller degree nonnegatively.
