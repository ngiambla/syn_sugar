in this article we define new flows on the hitchin components for psl(n,r).special examples of these flows are associated to simple closed curves on thesurface and give generalized twist flows. other examples, so called eruptionflows, are associated to pair of pants in s and capture new phenomena which arenot present in the case when n = 2. in a companion paper to this article two ofthe authors develop new tools to compute the goldman symplectic form on thehitchin component. using these computation we determine a global darbouxcoordinate system on the hitchin component.
