this article is the second of a pair of articles about the goldman symplecticform on the psl(v )-hitchin component. we show that any ideal triangulation ona closed connected surface of genus at least 2, and any compatible bridgesystem determine a symplectic trivialization of the tangent bundle to thehitchin component. using this, we prove that a large class of flows defined inthe companion paper [swz17] are hamiltonian. we also construct an explicitcollection of hamiltonian vector fields on the hitchin component that give asymplectic basis at every point. these are used in the companion paper tocompute explicit global darboux coordinates for the hitchin component.
