in this paper, a condition making vertex operator superalgebras to be unitaryis determined and an analogue of conformal spin-statistics theorem in conformalfield theory is proved. as an application of these results, it is proved thatunder some assumptions there exist vertex operator algebra structures on thedirect sum of simple current unitary modules of unitary vertex operatoralgebras.
