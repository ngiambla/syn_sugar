we generalize a support vector machine to a support spinor machine by usingthe mathematical structure of wedge product over vector machine in order toextend field from vector field to spinor field. the separated hyperplane isextended to kolmogorov space in time series data which allow us to extend astructure of support vector machine to a support tensor machine and a supporttensor machine moduli space. our performance test on support spinor machine isdone over one class classification of end point in physiology state of timeseries data after empirical mode analysis and compared with support vectormachine test. we implement algorithm of support spinor machine by usingholo-hilbert amplitude modulation for fully nonlinear and nonstationary timeseries data analysis.
