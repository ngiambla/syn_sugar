restrictions of incidence-preserving path maps produce an orientedhypergraphic all minors matrix-tree theorems for laplacian and adjacencymatrices. the images of these maps produce a locally signed graphic, incidencegeneralization, of cycle covers and basic figures that correspond toincidence-k-forests. when restricted to bidirected graphs the natural partialordering of maps results in disjoint signed boolean lattices whose minorcalculations correspond to principal order ideals. as an application, (1) thedeterminant formula of a signed graphic laplacian is reclaimed and shown to bedetermined by the maximal positive-circle-free elements, and (2) spanning treesare equivalent to single-element order ideals.
