we analyze the convergence rates to a planar interface in the mullins-sekerkamodel by applying a relaxation method based on relationships among distance,energy, and dissipation. the relaxation method was developed by two of theauthors in the context of the 1-d cahn-hilliard equation and the current workrepresents an extension to a higher dimensional problem in which the curvatureof the interface plays an important role. the convergence rates obtained areoptimal given the assumptions on the initial data.
