in this work we derive asymptotically sharp weighted korn and korn-likeinterpolation (or first and a half) inequalities in thin domains with singularweights. the constants $k$ (korn's constant) in the inequalities depend on thedomain thickness $h$ according to a power rule $k=ch^\alpha,$ where $c>0$ and$\alpha\in r$ are constants independent of $h$ and the displacement field. thesharpness of the estimates is understood in the sense that the asymptotics$h^\alpha$ is optimal as $h\to 0.$ the choice of the weights is motivated byseveral factors, in particular a spacial case occurs when making cartesian topolar change of variables in two dimensions.
