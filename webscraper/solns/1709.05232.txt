we prove that the k-theoretic nekrasov instanton partition functions have apositive radius of convergence in the instanton counting parameter and areholomorphic functions of the coulomb parameters in a suitable domain. wediscuss the implications for the agt correspondence and the analyticity of thenorm of gaiotto states for the deformed virasoro algebra. the proof is based onrandom matrix techniques and relies on an integral representation of thepartition function, due to nekrasov, which we also prove.
