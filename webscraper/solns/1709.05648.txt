in this paper, we prove the strong feller property for stochastic delay (orfunctional) differential equations with singular drift. we extend an approachof maslowski and seidler to derive the strong feller property of thoseequations. the argumentation is based on the well-posedness and the strongfeller property of the equations' drift-free version. to this aim, weinvestigate a certain convergence of random variables in topological spaces inorder to deal with discontinuous drift coefficients.
