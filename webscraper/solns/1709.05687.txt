uniform metastable convergence is a weak form of uniform convergence for afamily of sequences. in this paper we explore the way that metastableconvergence stratifies into a family of notions indexed by countable ordinals.  we give two versions of this stratified family, loosely speaking, theycorrespond to the model theoretic and proof theoretic perspectives. for themodel theoretic version, which we call abstract alpha-uniform convergence, weshow that uniform metastable convergence is equivalent to abstract$\alpha$-uniform convergence for some alpha, and that abstract omega-uniformconvergence is equivalent to uniformly bounded oscillation of the family ofsequences.  the proof theoretic version, which we call concrete alpha-uniformconvergence, is less canonical (it depends on a choice of ordinal notation),but appears naturally when "proof mining" convergence proofs to obtainquantitative bounds.  we show that these hierarchies are strict by exhibiting a family of which isconcretely alpha+1-uniformly convergent but not abstractly alpha-uniformlyconvergent for each alpha<omega_1.
