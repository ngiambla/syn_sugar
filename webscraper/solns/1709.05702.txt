this short note introduces a notion of directed homotopy equivalence and of"directed" topological complexity (which elaborates on the notion that can befound in e.g. farber's book) which have a number of desirable joint properties.in particular, being dihomotopically equivalent implies having bisimilarnatural homologies (defined in dubut et al. 2015). also, under mild conditions,directed topological complexity is an invariant of our directed homotopyequivalence and having a directed topological complexity equal to one is (underthese conditions) equivalent to being dihomotopy equivalent to a point (i.e.,to being "dicontractible", as in the undirected case). it still remains tocompare this notion with the notion introduced in dubut et al. 2016, which haslots of good properties as well. for now, it seems that for reasonable spaces,this new proposal of directed homotopy equivalence identifies more spaces thanthe one of dubut et al. 2016.
