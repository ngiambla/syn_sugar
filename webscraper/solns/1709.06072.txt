this paper proposes some bounds on the maximum of magnitude of a random maskin fourier domain. the random mask is used in random sampling scheme. having abound on the maximum value of a random mask in fourier domain is very usefulfor some iterative recovery methods that use thresholding operator. in thispaper, we propose some different bounds and compare them with the empiricalexamples.
