visible light communication (vlc) is an emerging technique that useslight-emitting diodes (led) to combine communication and illumination. it isconsidered as a promising scheme for indoor wireless communication that can bedeployed at reduced costs while offering high data rate performance. in thispaper, we focus on the design of the downlink of a multi-user vlc system.inherent to multi-user systems is the interference caused by the broadcastnature of the medium. linear precoding based schemes are among the most popularsolutions that have recently been proposed to mitigate inter-user interference.this paper focuses on the design of the optimal linear precoding scheme thatsolves the max-min signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (sinr) problem. theperformance of the proposed precoding scheme is studied under different workingconditions and compared with the classical zero-forcing precoding. simulationshave been provided to illustrate the high gain of the proposed scheme.
