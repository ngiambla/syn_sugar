we study ramsey-type problems in gallai-colorings. given a graph $g$ and aninteger $k\ge1$, the gallai-ramsey number $gr_k(k_3,g)$ is the least positiveinteger $n$ such that every $k$-coloring of the edges of the complete graph on$n$ vertices contains either a rainbow triangle or a monochromatic copy of $g$.it turns out that $gr_k(k_3, g)$ behaves more nicely than the classical ramseynumber $r_k(g)$. however, finding exact values of $gr_k (k_3, g)$ is far fromtrivial. in this paper, we prove that $gr_k(k_3, c_9)= 4\cdot 2^k+1$ for all$k\ge1$. this new result provides partial evidence for the first open case ofthe triple odd cycle conjecture of bondy and erd\h{o}s from 1973. our techniquerelies heavily on the structural result of gallai on edge-colorings of completegraphs without rainbow triangles. we believe the method we developed can beused to determine the exact values of $gr_k(k_3, c_n)$ for odd integers$n\ge11$.
