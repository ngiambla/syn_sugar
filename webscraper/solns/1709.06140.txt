optimal training design and maximum likelihood channel estimation for one-wayamplify-and-forward full duplex relay systems are proposed. the destinationestimates the residual self-interference (rsi) channel as well as theend-to-end channel of the relay system, aiming to cancel the rsi throughequalization. the log-likelihood function is maximized through a quasi-newtonmethod, with an mmse-based initialization. the cramer-rao bounds are derived toevaluate the accuracy of the estimates. by using szeg\"{o}'s theorems abouttoeplitz matrices, we minimize the cramer-rao bounds and find the correspondingoptimal training sequences. extensions of our method to frequency selectivechannels and multiple relays are also presented.
