in contrast with traditional video, panoramic video enables spherical viewingdirection with support for head-mounted displays, providing an interactive andimmersive experience. unfortunately, to the best of our knowledge, there arefew visual quality assessment (vqa) methods, either subjective or objective,for panoramic video. this paper proposes both subjective and objective methodsfor assessing quality loss in impaired panoramic video. specifically, we firstestablish a new database, which includes the viewing direction data fromseveral subjects watching panoramic video sequences. then, from our database,we find a high consistency in viewing direction across different subjects. theviewing directions are normally distributed in the center of the front regions,but they sometimes fall into other regions, related to video content. giventhis finding, we present a subjective vqa method for measuring different meanopinion score (dmos) of the whole and regional panoramic video, in terms ofoverall dmos (o-dmos) and vectorized dmos (v-dmos), respectively. moreover, wepropose two objective vqa methods for panoramic video, in light of humanperception characteristics of panoramic video. one method weighs the distortionof pixels with regard to their distances to the center of front regions, whichconsiders human preference in a panorama. the other method predicts viewingdirections according to video content, and then the predicted viewingdirections are leveraged to assign weights to the distortion of each pixel inour objective vqa method. finally, our experimental results verify that boththe subjective and objective methods proposed in this paper advancestate-of-the-art vqa for panoramic video.
