this work presents an experimental study of single input multiple output(simo) channel performance in indoor radio propagation environment. indoorchannel measurements at 2.4 ghz ism frequency band have been performed using aversatile channel sounder testbed platform. a single transmitting antenna, fourreceiving antennas with two proposed geometries and a four-branch receivercircuitry were used in order to achieve channel sounder measurements exploitingbaseband signal processing techniques. deep investigation on simo wirelesschannel performance was realized through three types of metrics which aresignal strength, gain coefficient and capacity. performance results indicatesimo channel capacity enhancement and illustrate differences between the twoproposed geometries.
