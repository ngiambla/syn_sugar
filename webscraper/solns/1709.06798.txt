in the class of metrics of a generic conformal structure there exists adistinguishing metric. this was noticed by albert einstein in a lesser-knownpaper of 1921 (berl. ber., 1921, pp. 261-264). we explore this finding from ageometrical point of view. then, we obtain a family of scalar conformalinvariants of weight 0 for generic pseudo-riemannian conformal structures $[g]$in more than three dimensions. in particular, we define the conformal scalarcurvature of $[g]$ and calculate it for some well-known conformal spacetimes,comparing the results with the ricci scalar and the kretschmann scalar. in thecited paper, einstein also announced that it is possible to add an scalarequation to the field equations of general relativity.
