smart grid is an energy infrastructure that increases energy efficiency byusing communication infrastructure, smart meters, smart appliances, automatedcontrol and networking, and more. this paper focuses on the power linecommunication (plc) aspect and technologies used in the smart grid. there arevarious challenges and advancements in the smart grid; this research discusseshow plc can improve smart grid performance. in order to provide applicableresults, practical plc system parameters and other required data was obtainedfrom florida power and light (fpl). modeling of the plc system with differenttypes of digital modulations was conducted using matlab/simulink software andpython. the benefits and design tradeoffs of amplitude shift keying (ask),frequency shift keying (fsk), and phase shift keying (psk) are discussed. themodulation schemes are compared on the basis of their applicability to apractical plc network by comparing the results of the simulations
