transformers and transmission lines are critical components of a gridnetwork. this paper analyzes the statistical properties of the electricalparameters of transmission branches and especially examines theirinterdependence on the voltage levels. some interesting findings include: (a)with appropriate conversion of mva rating, a transformers per unit reactanceexhibits consistent statistical pattern independent of voltage levels andcapacity; (b) the distributed reactance (ohms/km) of transmission lines alsohas some consistent patterns regardless of voltage levels; (c) other parameterssuch as the branch resistance, the mva ratings, the transmission line length,etc, manifest strong interdependence on the voltage levels which can beapproximated by a power function with different power constants. the resultswill be useful in both creation of synthetic power grid test cases andvalidation of existing grid models.
