a permutation graph is a graph that can be derived from a permutation, wherethe vertices correspond to letters of the permutation, and the edges representinversions. we provide a construction to show that there are infinitely manyconnected $r$-regular permutation graphs for $r \geq 3$. we prove that all$3$-regular permutation graphs arise from a similar construction. finally, weenumerate all $3$-regular permutation graphs on $n$ vertices.
