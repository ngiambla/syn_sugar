we obtain exact solutions to the two-dimensional (2d) dirac equation for theone-dimensional p\"oschl-teller potential which contains an asymmetry term. theeigenfunctions are expressed in terms of heun confluent functions, while theeigenvalues are determined via the solutions of a simple transcendentalequation. for the symmetric case, the eigenfunctions of the supercriticalstates are expressed as spheroidal wave functions, and approximate analyticalexpressions are obtained for the corresponding eigenvalues. a universalcondition for any square integrable symmetric potential is obtained for theminimum strength of the potential required to hold a bound state of zeroenergy. applications for smooth electron waveguides in 2d dirac-weyl systemsare discussed.
