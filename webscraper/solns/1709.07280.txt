the aim of this paper is to study complete (noncompact) steady$m$-quasi-einstein manifolds satisfying a fourth-order vanishing condition onthe weyl tensor. in this case, we are able to prove that a steady$m$-quasi-einstein manifold ($m>1$) on a simply connected $n$-dimensionalmanifold $(m^{n},g)$, $(n\geq4),$ with nonnegative ricci curvature and zeroradial weyl curvature must be a warped product with $(n-1)-$dimensionaleinstein fiber, provided that $m$ has fourth order divergence-free weyl tensor(i.e., ${\rm div}^{4}w=0$).
