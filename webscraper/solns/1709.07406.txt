the reproducibility issue in science has come under increased scrutiny. oneconsistent suggestion lies in the use of scripted methods or workflows for dataanalysis. image analysis is one area in science in which little can be done inscripted methods. the swiim project (scripted workflows to improve imagemanipulation) is designed to generate workflows from popular image manipulationtools. in the project, 2 approaches are being taken to construct workflows inthe image analysis area. first, the open-source tool gimp is being enhanced toproduce an active log (which can be run on a stand-alone basis to perform thesame manipulation). second, the r system shiny tool is being used to constructa graphical user interface (gui) which works with ebimage code to modifyimages, and to produce an active log which can perform the same operations.this process has been successful to date, but is not complete. the basic methodfor each component is discussed, and example code is shown.
