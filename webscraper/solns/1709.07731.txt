we investigate an existing distributed algorithm for learning sparse signalsor data over networks. the algorithm is iterative and exchanges intermediateestimates of a sparse signal over a network. this learning strategy usingexchange of intermediate estimates over the network requires a limitedcommunication overhead for information transmission. our objective in thisarticle is to show that the strategy is good for learning in spite of limitedcommunication. in pursuit of this objective, we first provide a restrictedisometry property (rip)-based theoretical analysis on convergence of theiterative algorithm. then, using simulations, we show that the algorithmprovides competitive performance in learning sparse signals vis-a-vis anexisting alternate distributed algorithm. the alternate distributed algorithmexchanges more information including observations and system parameters.
