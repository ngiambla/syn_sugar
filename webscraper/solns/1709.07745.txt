the article presents the experimental measurements of the amplitude of themoir\'e patterns in a digital autostereoscopic barrier-type 3d display across awide angular range with a small increment. the period and orientation of themoir\'e patterns were also measured as functions of the angle. simultaneousbranches are observed and analyzed. the theoretical interpretation is alsogiven. the results can help preventing or minimizing the moir\'e effect indisplays.
