convolutive non-negative matrix factorization model factorizes a given audiospectrogram using frequency templates with a temporal dimension. in this paper,we present a convolutional auto-encoder model that acts as a neural networkalternative to convolutive nmf. using the modeling flexibility granted byneural networks, we also explore the idea of using a recurrent neural networkin the encoder. experimental results on speech mixtures from timit datasetindicate that the convolutive architecture provides a significant improvementin separation performance in terms of bsseval metrics.
