with the increase in awareness about the climate change, there has been atremendous shift towards utilizing renewable energy sources (res). in thisregard, smart grid technologies have been presented to facilitate higherpenetration of res. microgrids are the key components of the smart grids.microgrids allow integration of various distributed energy resources (der) suchas the distributed generation (dgs) and energy storage systems (esss) into thedistribution system and hence remove or delay the need for distributionexpansion. one of the crucial requirements for utilities is to ensure that thesystem reliability is maintained with the inclusion of microgrid topology.therefore, this paper evaluates the reliability of a microgrid containingprioritized loads and distributed res through a hybrid analytical-simulationmethod. the stochasticity of res introduces complexity to the reliabilityevaluation. the method takes into account the variability of res through monte-carlo state sampling simulation. the results indicate the reliabilityenhancement of the overall system in the presence of the microgrid topology. inparticular, the highest priority load has the largest improvement in thereliability indices. furthermore, sensitivity analysis is performed tounderstand the effects of the failure of microgrid islanding in the case of afault in the upstream network.
