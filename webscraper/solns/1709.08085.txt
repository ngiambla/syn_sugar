we present the modeling and characterization of a time-reversal routingdispersion code multiple access (tr-dcma) system. we show that this systemmaintains the low complexity advantage of dcma transceivers while offeringdynamic adaptivity for practial communication scenarios. we first derive themathematical model and explain operation principles of the system, and thencharacterize its interference, signal to interference ratio, and bit errorprobability characteristics.
