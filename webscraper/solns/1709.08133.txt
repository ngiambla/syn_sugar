in this paper, we present voltage- and current-mode differential magnet-lessnon-reciprocal devices obtained by pairing two single-ended (se) circulators,each consisting of three first-order bandpass or bandstop lc filters, connectedin either a wye or a delta topology. the resonant poles of each se circulatorare modulated in time with 120 deg phase-shifted periodic signals, resulting insynthetic angular-momentum biasing achieved through spatio-temporal modulation(stm). we tailor the two se circulators to exhibit a constant 180 deg phasedifference between their stm biases. unlike conventional differentialtime-variant circuits, for which only the even or odd spurs are rejected, weshow that the proposed configuration cancels out all intermodulation (im)products, thus making them operate alike linear time-invariant (lti) circuitsfor an external observer. in turn, this property enhances all metrics of theresulting circulator, overcoming the limitations of se architectures, andimproving insertion loss, impedance matching, bandwidth and noise figure. weshow that this differential architecture also significantly relaxes therequired modulation parameters, both in frequency and amplitude. we develop arigorous small-signal model to guide the design of the proposed circuits and toget insights into their pseudo-lti characteristics. then, we validate thetheory with simulations and measurements showing remarkable performancecompared to the current state of the art of magnet-less non-reciprocal devices.
