it is proved that the fibonacci and the frolov point sets, which are known tobe very good for numerical integration, have optimal rate of decay ofdispersion with respect to the cardinality of sets. this implies that thefibonacci and the frolov point sets provide universal discretization of theuniform norm for natural collections of subspaces of the multivariatetrigonometric polynomials. it is shown how the optimal upper bounds fordispersion can be derived from the upper bounds for a new characteristic -- thesmooth fixed volume discrepancy. it is proved that the fibonacci point setsprovide the universal discretization of all integral norms.
