starting from a finite-dimensional representation of the yangian$y(\mathfrak{g})$ for a simple lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ in drinfeld'soriginal presentation, we construct a hopf algebra$x_\mathcal{i}(\mathfrak{g})$, called the extended yangian, whose definingrelations are encoded in a ternary matrix relation built from a specific$r$-matrix $r(u)$. we prove that there is a surjective hopf algebra morphism$x_\mathcal{i}(\mathfrak{g})\twoheadrightarrow y(\mathfrak{g})$ whose kernel isgenerated as an ideal by the coefficients of a central matrix $\mathcal{z}(u)$.when the underlying representation is irreducible, we show that this matrixbecomes a grouplike central series, thereby making available a proof of awell-known theorem stated by drinfeld in the 1980's. we then study in detailthe algebraic structure of the extended yangian, and prove severalgeneralizations of results which are known to hold for yangians associated toclassical lie algebras in their $r$-matrix presentations.
