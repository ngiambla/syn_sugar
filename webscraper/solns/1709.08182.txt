in this paper, we present on-sensor neuromorphic vision hardwareimplementation of denoising spatial filter. the mean or median spatial filterswith fixed window shape are known for its denoising ability, however, have thedrawback of blurring the object edges. the effect of blurring increases with anincrease in window size. to preserve the edge information, we propose anadaptive spatial filter that uses neuron's ability to detect similar pixels andcalculates the mean. the analog input differences of neighborhood pixels areconverted to the chain of pulses with voltage controlled oscillator and appliedas neuron input. when the input pulses charge the neuron to equal or greaterlevel than its threshold, the neuron will fire, and pixels are identified assimilar. the sequence of the neuron's responses for pixels is stored in theserial-in-parallel-out shift register. the outputs of shift registers are usedas input to the selector switches of an averaging circuit making this anadaptive mean operation resulting in an edge preserving mean filter. systemlevel simulation of the hardware is conducted using 150 images from caltechdatabase with added gaussian noise to test the robustness of edge-preservingand denoising ability of the proposed filter. threshold values of the hardwareneuron were adjusted so that the proposed edge-preserving spatial filterachieves optimal performance in terms of psnr and mse, and these resultsoutperforms that of the conventional mean and median filters.
