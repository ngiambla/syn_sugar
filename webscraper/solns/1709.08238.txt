a counterparty credit limit (ccl) is a limit imposed by a financialinstitution to cap its maximum possible exposure to a specified counterparty.although ccls are designed to help institutions mitigate counterparty risk byselective diversification of their exposures, their implementation restrictsthe liquidity that institutions can access in an otherwise centralized pool. weaddress the question of how this mechanism impacts trade prices and volatility,both empirically and via a new model of trading with ccls. we find empiricallythat ccls cause little impact on trade. however, our model highlights that inextreme situations, ccls could serve to destabilize prices and therebyinfluence systemic risk.
