we extend certain classical theorems in pluripotential theory to a class offunctions defined on the support of a $(1,1)$-closed positive current $t$,analogous to plurisubharmonic functions, called $t$-plurisubharmonic functions.these functions are defined as limits, on the support of $t$, of sequences ofplurisubharmonic functions decreasing on this support. in particular, we showthat the poles of such functions are pluripolar sets. we also show that themaximum principle and the hartogs's theorem remain valid in a weak sense. westudy these functions by means of a class of measures, so-called "pluri-jensenmeasures", about which we prove that they are numerous on the support of$(1,1)$-closed positive currents. we also obtain, for any fat compact set, anexpression of its relative green's function in terms of an infimum of anintegral over a set of pluri-jensen measures. we then deduce, by means of thesemeasures, a characterization of the polynomially convex fat compact sets, aswell as a characterization of pluripolar sets, and the fact that the support ofa closed positive $(1,1)$-current is nowhere pluri-thin. in the second part ofthis article, these tools are used to study dynamics of a certain class ofautomorphisms of $\mathbb{c}^n$ which naturally generalize h\'enon'sautomorphisms of $\mathbb{c}^2$. first we study the geometry of the support ofcanonical invariant currents. then we obtain an equidistribution result for theconvergence of pull-back of certain measures towards an ergodic invariantmeasure, with compact support.
