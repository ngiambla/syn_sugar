compressed air energy storage (caes) is suitable for large-scale energystorage and can help to increase the penetration of wind power in powersystems. a caes plant consists of compressors, expanders, caverns, and amotor/generator set. currently used cavern models for caes are either accuratebut highly non-linear or linear but inaccurate. highly non-linear cavern modelscannot be directly utilized in power system optimization problems. in thisregard, an accurate bi-linear cavern model for caes is proposed in this firstpaper of a two-part series. the charging and discharging processes in a cavernare divided into several virtual states and then the first law ofthermodynamics and ideal gas law are used to derive a cavern model, i.e., modelfor the variation of temperature and pressure in these processes. thereafter,the heat transfer between the air in the cavern and the cavern wall isconsidered and integrated into the cavern model. by subsequently eliminatingseveral negligible terms, the cavern model reduces to a bi-linear (linear)model for caes with multiple (single) time steps. the accuracy of the proposedcavern model is verified via comparison with an accurate non-linear model.
