unit commitment (uc) is one of the most important power system operationproblems. to integrate higher penetration of wind power into power systems,more compressed air energy storage (caes) plants are being built. existingcavern models for the caes used in power system optimization problems are notaccurate, which may lead to infeasible solutions, e.g., the air pressure in thecavern is outside its operating range. in this regard, an accurate caes modelis proposed for the uc problem based on the accurate bi-linear cavern modelproposed in the first paper of this two-part series. the minimum switch timebetween the charging and discharging processes of caes is considered. the wholemodel, i.e., the uc model with an accurate caes model, is a large-scale mixedinteger bi-linear programming problem. to reduce the complexity of the wholemodel, three strategies are proposed to reduce the number of bi-linear termswithout sacrificing accuracy. mccormick relaxation and piecewise linearizationare then used to linearize the whole model. to decrease the solution time, amethod to obtain an initial solution of the linearized model is proposed. amodified rts-79 system is used to verify the effectiveness of the whole modeland the solution methodology.
