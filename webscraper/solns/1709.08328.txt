chirping phenomena, in which the instantaneous frequencies of a signal changewith time, are abundant in signals related to biological systems. biosignalsare non-stationary in nature and the time-frequency analysis is a viable toolto analyze them. it is well understood that gaussian chirplet function iscritical in describing chirp signals. despite the theory of adaptive chirplettransform (act) has been established for more than two decades and is wellaccepted in the community of signal processing, application of act tobio-/biomedical signal analysis is still quite limited, probably because thatthe power of act, as an emerging tool for biosignal analysis, has not yet beenfully appreciated by the researchers in the field of biomedical engineering. inthis paper, we describe a novel act algorithm based on the "coarse-refinement"scheme. namely, the initial estimate of a chirplet is implemented with thematching-pursuit (mp) algorithm and subsequently it is refined using theexpectation-maximization (em) algorithm, which we coin as mpem algorithm. weemphasize the robustness enhancement of the algorithm in face of noise, whichis important to biosignal analysis, as they are usually embedded in strongbackground noise. we then demonstrate the capability of our algorithm byapplying it to the analysis of representative biosignals, including visualevoked potentials (bioelectrical signals), audible heart sounds and batultrasonic echolocation signals (bioacoustic signals), and human speech. theresults show that the mpem algorithm provides more compact representation ofsignals under investigation and clearer visualization of their time-frequencystructures, indicating considerable promise of act in biosignal analysis. thematlab code repository is hosted on github for free download(https://github.com/jiecui/mpact).
