this present research investigated the relationship between personalimpressions and the acoustic nonverbal communication conveyed by employeesbeing interviewed. first, we investigated the extent to which differentconversation topics addressed during the interview induced changes in theinterviewees' acoustic parameters. next, we attempted to predict the observedand self-assessed attitudes and body language of the interviewees based on theacoustic data. the results showed that topicality caused significant deviationsin the acoustic parameters statistics, but the ability to predict the personalperceptions of the interviewees based on their acoustic non-verbalcommunication was relatively independent of topicality, due to the naturalredundancy inherent in acoustic attributes. our findings suggest that jointmodeling of speech and visual cues may improve the assessment of intervieweeprofiles.
