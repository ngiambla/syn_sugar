discrete wavelet transform of finite-length signals must necessarily handlethe signal boundaries. the state-of-the-art approaches treat such boundaries ina complicated and inflexible way, using special prolog or epilog phases. thisholds true in particular for images decomposed into a number of scales,exemplary in jpeg 2000 coding system. in this paper, the state-of-the-artapproaches are extended to perform the treatment using a compact streamingcore, possibly in multi-scale fashion. we present the core focused on cdf 5/3wavelet and the symmetric border extension method, both employed in the jpeg2000. as a result of our work, every input sample is visited only once, whilethe results are produced immediately, i.e. without buffering.
