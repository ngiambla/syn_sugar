data traffic demand in cellular networks has been tremendously growing andhas led to creating congested rf environment. accordingly, innovativeapproaches for spectrum sharing have been proposed and implemented toaccommodate several systems within the same frequency band. spectrum sharingbetween radar and communication systems is one of the important research anddevelopment areas. in this paper, we present the fundamental spectrum sharingconcepts and technologies, then we provide an updated and comprehensive surveyof spectrum sharing techniques that have been developed to enable some of thewireless communication systems to coexist in the same band as radar systems.
