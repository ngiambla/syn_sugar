in a previous article it was shown that when a three-dimensional smoothconvex body has rotational symmetry around a coordinate axis one can findbetter bounds for the lattice point discrepancy than what is known for moregeneral convex bodies. to accomplish this, however, it was necessary to assumea non-vanishing condition on the third derivative of the generatrix. in thisarticle we drop this condition, showing that the aforementioned bound holds fora wider family of revolution bodies, which includes those with analyticboundary. a novelty in our approach is that, besides the usual analyticmethods, it requires studying some diophantine properties of the taylorcoefficients of the phase on the fourier transform side.
