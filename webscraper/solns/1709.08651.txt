the general theoretical approach to the asymptotic extraction of the signalseries from the perturbed signal with the help of singular spectrum analysis(briefly, ssa) was already outlined in nekrutkin 2010, sii, v. 3, 297--319.  in this paper we consider the example of such an analysis applied to theincreasing exponential signal and the sinusoidal noise. it is proved that ifthe signal rapidly tends to infinity, then the so-called reconstruction errorsof ssa do not uniformly tend to zero as the series length tends to infinity.more precisely, in this case any finite number of last terms of the errorseries do not tend to any finite or infinite values.  on the contrary, for the "discretization" scheme with the bounded from aboveexponential signal, all elements of the error series tend to zero.  this effect shows that the discretization model can be an effective tool inthe theoretical ssa considerations with increasing signals.
