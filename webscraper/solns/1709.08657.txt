we construct a colored operad whose category of algebras is canonicallyisomorphic to the category of algebraic quantum field theories. this isachieved by a construction that depends on the choice of a category, whoseobjects provide the operad colors, equipped with an additional structure thatwe call an orthogonality relation. this allows us to describe different typesof quantum field theories, including theories on a fixed lorentzian manifold,locally covariant theories and also chiral conformal and euclidean theories.moreover, because the colored operad depends functorially on the orthogonalcategory, we obtain adjunctions between categories of different types ofquantum field theories. these include novel and physically very interestingconstructions, such as time-slicification and local-to-global extensions ofquantum field theories. we compare the latter to fredenhagen's universalalgebra.
