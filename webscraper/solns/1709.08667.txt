a fundamental assumption underling any hypothesis testing (ht) problem isthat the available data follow the parametric model assumed to derive the teststatistic. nevertheless, a perfect match between the true and the assumed datamodels cannot be achieved in many practical applications. in all these cases,it is advisable to use a robust decision test, i.e. a test whose statisticpreserves (at least asymptotically) the same probability density function (pdf)for a suitable set of possible input data models under the null hypothesis.building upon the seminal work of kent (1982), in this paper we investigate theimpact of the model mismatch in a recurring ht problem in radar signalprocessing applications: testing the mean of a set of complex ellipticallysymmetric (ces) distributed random vectors under a possible misspecified,gaussian data model. in particular, by using this general misspecifiedframework, a new look to two popular detectors, the kelly's generalizedlikelihood ration test (glrt) and the adaptive matched filter (amf), isprovided and their robustness properties investigated.
