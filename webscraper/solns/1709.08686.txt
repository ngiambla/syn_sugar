let $i(n):=\int_0^1 [x^n+(1-x)^n]^\frac1n dx.$ in this paper, we show that$i(n)= \sum_0^\infty \frac{i_i}{n^i},n\rightarrow \infty$ and we compute $i_i,i =0..5$, obtained by polylog functions and euler sums. as a corollary, weobtain explicit expressions for some integrals involving functions $ u^i,exp(-u), (1 +exp(-u))^j , ln(1 + exp(-u))^k$ . as another asymptotic result,let $s_0(z):=\frac{li_m(1)}{li_m(1)-li_m(z)}$, where $li_m(z)$ is the polylogfunction. we provide the asymptotic behaviour of $s_n,n\rightarrow \infty$where $s_n:=[z^n]s_0(z)$. this paper fits within the framework of analyticcombinatorics.
