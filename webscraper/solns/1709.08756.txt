this work extends monotonicity-based methods in inverse problems to the caseof the helmholtz (or stationary schr\"odinger) equation $(\delta + k^2 q) u =0$ in a bounded domain for fixed non-resonance frequency $k>0$ and real-valuedscattering coefficient function $q$. we show a monotonicity relation betweenthe scattering coefficient $q$ and the local neumann-dirichlet operator thatholds up to finitely many eigenvalues. combining this with the method oflocalized potentials, or runge approximation, adapted to the case wherefinitely many constraints are present, we derive a constructivemonotonicity-based characterization of scatterers from partial boundary data.we also obtain the local uniqueness result that two coefficient functions $q_1$and $q_2$ can be distinguished by partial boundary data if there is aneighborhood of the boundary where $q_1\geq q_2$ and $q_1\not\equiv q_2$.
