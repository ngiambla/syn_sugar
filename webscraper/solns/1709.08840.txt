this paper discusses discrete-time maps of the form $x(k + 1) = f(x(k))$,focussing on equilibrium points of such maps. under some circumstances,lefschetz fixed-point theory can be used to establish the existence of a singlelocally attractive equilibrium (which is sometimes globally attractive) when ageneral property of local attractivity is known for any equilibrium. problemsin social networks often involve such discrete-time systems, and we make anapplication to one such problem.
