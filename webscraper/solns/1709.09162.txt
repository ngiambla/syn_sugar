we investigate the class of quasitrivial semigroups and provide variouscharacterizations of the subclass of quasitrivial and commutative semigroups aswell as the subclass of quasitrivial and order-preserving semigroups. we alsodetermine explicitly the sizes of these classes when the semigroups are definedon finite sets. as a byproduct of these enumerations, we obtain several newinteger sequences.
