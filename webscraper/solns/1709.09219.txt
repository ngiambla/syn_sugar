distributed generation (dg) is an effective way of integrating renewableenergy sources to conventional power grid, which improves the reliability andefficiency of power systems. photovoltaic (pv) systems are ideal dgs thanks totheir attractive benefits, such as availability of solar energy and lowinstallation costs. battery groups are used in pv systems to balance the powerflows and eliminate power fluctuations due to change of operating condition,e.g., irradiance and temperature variation. in an attempt to effectively managethe power flows, this paper presents a novel power control and managementsystem for grid-connected pv-battery systems. the proposed system realizes themaximum power point tracking (mppt) of the pv panels, stabilization of the dcbus voltage for load plug-and-play access, balance among the power flows, andquick response of both active and reactive power demands.
