we extend some results of group representation theory and von neumannalgebras to the quaternionic hilbert space case, proving the double commutanttheorem (whose quaternionic proof requires a different procedure) and extend tothe quaternionic case a result concerning the classification of irreducible vonneumann algebras. secondly, we consider elementary relativistic systems inwigner's view defined as a locally-faithful irreducible strongly-continuousunitary representation of poincar\'e group in quaternionic hilbert space. weprove that, if the squared-mass operator is non-negative, the system admits anatural, poincar\'e invariant and unique up to sign, complex structurecommuting with the observables of the system leading to a physically equivalentreformulation in complex hilbert space. differently from the quaternionicformulation, all selfadjoint operators are now observables, noether theoremholds and composite systems may be given in terms of tensor product. in thethird part, we use a physically more accurate notion of relativistic elementarysystem: irreducibility regards the algebra of observables only, symmetries areautomorphisms of the restricted lattice of elementary propositions and we adopta notion of continuity referred to the states viewed as probability measures onthe elementary propositions. we prove that again there exists a unique (up tosign) poincar\'e invariant complex structure making the theory complex.relativistic elementary systems are naturally and better described in complexhilbert spaces even if starting from a real or quaternionic hilbert spaceformulations and this complex description is uniquely fixed by physics.
