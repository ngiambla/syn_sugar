in this paper we prove strong feller property for the markov semigroupsassociated to the two or three dimensional navier-stokes (n-s) equations drivenby space-time white noise using the theory of regularity structures introducedby martin hairer in [hai14]. this implies global well-posedness of 2d n-sequation driven by space-time white noise starting from every initial point in$c^\eta$ for $\eta\in (-\frac{1}{2},0)$.
