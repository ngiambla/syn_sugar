in this dissertation the practical speech emotion recognition technology isstudied, including several cognitive related emotion types, namely fidgetiness,confidence and tiredness. the high quality of naturalistic emotional speechdata is the basis of this research. the following techniques are used forinducing practical emotional speech: cognitive task, computer game, noisestimulation, sleep deprivation and movie clips.  a practical speech emotion recognition system is studied based on gaussianmixture model. a two-class classifier set is adopted for performanceimprovement under the small sample case. considering the context information incontinuous emotional speech, a gaussian mixture model embedded with markovnetworks is proposed.  a further study is carried out for system robustness analysis. first, noisereduction algorithm based on auditory masking properties is fist introduced tothe practical speech emotion recognition. second, to deal with the complicatedunknown emotion types under real situation, an emotion recognition method withrejection ability is proposed, which enhanced the system compatibility againstunknown emotion samples. third, coping with the difficulties brought by a largenumber of unknown speakers, an emotional feature normalization method based onspeaker-sensitive feature clustering is proposed. fourth, by adding theelectrocardiogram channel, a bi-modal emotion recognition system based onspeech signals and electrocardiogram signals is first introduced.  the speech emotion recognition methods studied in this dissertation may beextended into the cross-language speech emotion recognition and the whisperedspeech emotion recognition.
