we study the problem of stationarity and ergodicity for autoregressivemultinomial logistic time series models which possibly include a latent processand are defined by a garch-type recursive equation. we improve considerablyupon the existing results related to stationarity and ergodicity conditions ofsuch models. proofs are based on theory developed for chains with completeconnections. this approach is based on a useful coupling technique which isutilized for studying ergodicity of more general finite-state stochasticprocesses. such processes generalize finite-state markov chains by assuminginfinite order models of past values. for finite order markov chains, we alsodiscuss ergodicity properties when some strongly exogenous covariates areconsidered in the dynamics of the process.
