in recent years, knapsack problems for (in general non-commutative) groupshave attracted attention. in this paper, the knapsack problem for wreathproducts is studied. it turns out that decidability of knapsack is notpreserved under wreath product. on the other hand, the class ofknapsack-semilinear groups, where solutions sets of knapsack equations areeffectively semilinear, is closed under wreath product. as a consequence, weobtain the decidability of knapsack for free solvable groups. finally, it isshown that for every non-trivial abelian group $g$, knapsack (as well as therelated subset sum problem) for the wreath product $g \wr \mathbb{z}$ isnp-complete.
