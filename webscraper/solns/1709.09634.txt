scene text is an important feature to be extracted, especially invision-based mobile robot navigation as many potential landmarks such asnameplates and information signs contain text. in this paper, a novel two-steptext localization method for indoor mobile robot navigation is introduced. thismethod is based on morphological operators and machine learning techniques andcan be used in real time environments. the proposed method has two steps. atfirst, a new set of morphological operators is applied with a particularsequence to extract high contrast areas that have high probability of textexistence. using of morphological operators has many advantages such as: highcomputation speed, being invariant to several geometrical transformations liketranslation, rotations, and scaling, and being able to extract all areascontaining text. after extracting text candidate regions, a set of ninefeatures are extracted for accurate detection and deletion of the regions thatdon't have text. these features are descriptors for texture properties and arecomputed in real time. then, we use a svm classifier to detect the existence oftext in the region. performance of the proposed algorithm is compared against anumber of widely used text localization algorithms and the results show thatthis method can quickly and effectively localize and extract text regions fromreal scenes and can be used in mobile robot navigation under an indoorenvironment to detect text based landmarks.
