we establish exact recovery for the least unsquared deviations (lud)algorithm of \"{o}zyesil and singer. more precisely, we show that forsufficiently many cameras with given corrupted pairwise directions, where bothcamera locations and pairwise directions are generated by a specialprobabilistic model, the lud algorithm exactly recovers the camera locationswith high probability. a similar exact recovery guarantee was established forthe shapefit algorithm by hand, lee and voroninski, but with typically lesscorruption.
