we use fuchsian reduction to construct singular solutions of einstein'sequations which belong to the class of gowdy spacetimes. the solutions have themaximum number of arbitrary functions. special cases correspond to polarized,or other known solutions. the method provides precise asymptotics at thesingularity, which is kasner-like. all of these solutions are asymptoticallyvelocity-dominated. the results account for the fact that solutions withvelocity parameter uniformly greater than one are not observed numerically.they also provide a justification of formal expansions proposed bygrubi\v{s}i\'c and moncrief.
