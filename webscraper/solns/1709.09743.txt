we define the concept of an `open' markov process, a continuous-time markovchain equipped with specified boundary states through which probability canflow in and out of the system. external couplings which fix the probabilitiesof boundary states induce non-equilibrium steady states characterized bynon-zero probability currents flowing through the system. we show that thesenon-equilibrium steady states minimize a quadratic form which we call`dissipation.' this is closely related to prigogine's principle of minimumentropy production. we bound the rate of change of the entropy of a drivennon-equilibrium steady state relative to the underlying equilibrium state interms of the flow of probability through the boundary of the process.  we then consider open markov processes as morphisms in a symmetric monoidalcategory by splitting up their boundary states into certain sets of `inputs'and `outputs.' composition corresponds to gluing the outputs of one such openmarkov process onto the inputs of another so that the probability flowing outof the first process is equal to the probability flowing into the second. weconstruct a `black-box' functor characterizing the behavior of an open markovprocess in terms of the space of possible steady state probabilities andprobability currents along the boundary. the fact that this is a functor meansthat the behavior of a composite open markov process can be computed bycomposing the behaviors of the open markov processes from which it is composed.we prove a similar black-boxing theorem for reaction networks whose dynamicsare given by the non-linear rate equation. along the way we describe a moregeneral category of open dynamical systems where composition corresponds togluing together open dynamical systems.
