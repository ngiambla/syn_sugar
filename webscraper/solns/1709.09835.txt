we study several ideal-based constructions in the context of singularstationarity. by combining methods of strong ideals, supercompact embeddings,and prikry-type posets, we obtain three consistency results concerning mutuallystationary sets, and answer a question of foreman and magidor concerningstationary sequences on the first uncountable cardinals, $\aleph_n$, $1 \leq n< \omega$.
