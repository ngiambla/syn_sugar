power distribution grids are exploited by power line communication (plc)technology to convey high frequency data signals. the natural conformation ofsuch power line networks causes a relevant part of the high frequency signalstraveling through them to be radiated instead of being conducted. this causesnot only electromagnetic interference (emi) with devices positioned next topower line cables, but also a consistent deterioration of the signal integrity.since existing plc channel models do not take into account losses due toradiation phenomena, this paper responds to the need of developing accuratenetwork simulators. a thorough analysis is herein presented about the conductedand radiated effects on the signal integrity, digging into differential mode tocommon mode signal conversion due to network imbalances. the outcome of thiswork allows each network element to be described by a mixed-mode transmissionmatrix. furthermore, the classical per-unit-length equivalent circuit oftransmission lines is extended to incorporate radiation resistances. theresults of this paper lay the foundations for future developments ofcomprehensive power line network models that incorporate conducted and radiatedphenomena.
