we construct a fixed parameter algorithm parameterized by d and k that takesas an input a graph g' obtained from a d-degenerate graph g by complementing onat most k arbitrary subsets of the vertex set of g and outputs a graph h suchthat g and h agree on all but f(d,k) vertices.  our work is motivated by the first order model checking in graph classes thatare first order interpretable in classes of sparse graphs. we derive as acorollary that if g_0 is a graph class with bounded expansion, then the firstorder model checking is fixed parameter tractable in the class of all graphsthat can obtained from a graph g from g_0 by complementing on at most karbitrary subsets of the vertex set of g; this implies an earlier result thatthe first order model checking is fixed parameter tractable in graph classesinterpretable in classes of graphs with bounded maximum degree.
