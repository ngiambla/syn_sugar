in this paper, we construct an integral map for differential forms on theloop space of riemannian spin manifolds. in particular, the even and oddbismut-chern characters are integrable by this map, with their integrals givenby indices of dirac operators. we also show that our integral map satisfies aversion of the localization principle in equivariant cohomology. this shouldprovide a rigorous background for supersymmetry proofs of the atiyah-singerindex theorem.
