the pfaffian line bundle of the covariant derivative and the transgression ofthe spin lifting gerbe are two canonically given real line bundles on the loopspace of an oriented riemannian manifold. it has been shown by prat-waldronthat these line bundles are naturally isomorphic as metric line bundles andthat the isomorphism maps their canonical sections to each other. in thispaper, we provide a vast generalization of his results, by showing that thereare natural sections of the corresponding line bundles for any $n \in \n$,which are mapped to each other under this isomorphism (with the previouslyknown being the one for $n=0$). these canonical sections are important todefine the fermionic part of the supersymmetric path integral on the loopspace.
