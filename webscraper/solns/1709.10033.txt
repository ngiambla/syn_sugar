for initial datum of finite kinetic energy, leray has proven in 1934 thatthere exists at least one global in time finite energy weak solution of the 3dnavier-stokes equations. in this paper we prove that weak solutions of the 3dnavier-stokes equations are not unique in the class of weak solutions withfinite kinetic energy. moreover, we prove that holder continuous dissipativeweak solutions of the 3d euler equations may be obtained as a strong vanishingviscosity limit of a sequence of finite energy weak solutions of the 3dnavier-stokes equations.
