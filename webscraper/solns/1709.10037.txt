integer forcing (if) is a novel linear receiver architecture, where insteadof separating the codewords sent by each transmitter, and decoding themindividually, forces integer-valued linear combinations at each receiveantenna, and decodes the linear combinations. the original codewords areobtained by inverting the integer-valued matrix. while demonstrating superiorperformance, if requires complex optimization in order to find the optimallinear combinations, and demands either using multi-level nested lattice codes,or reducing the rates of all transmitters to equal the weakest one. finally,the distribution of the resulting effective snr is hard to evaluate.  in this paper, we first give simple upper and lower bounds on the effectivesnr of a single linear combination in if. these expressions allow us to easilybound the distribution of the effective snr for any given linear combinationused. we then suggest two simple block-based if schemes. these schemes, whilesub-optimal, significantly reduce the complexity of the optimization process,and, more importantly, do not require reducing the rates of all transmitters,as decoding is done block-wise. finally, we bound the distribution of theeffective snr of the decoding schemes, and show via simulations the superiorityof block-wise schemes at low snr.
