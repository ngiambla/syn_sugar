korpelainen, lozin, and razgon conjectured that a hereditary property ofgraphs which is well-quasi-ordered by the induced subgraph order and defined byonly finitely many minimal forbidden induced subgraphs is labelledwell-quasi-ordered, a notion stronger than that of $n$-well-quasi-orderintroduced by pouzet in the 1970s. we present a counterexample to thisconjecture. in fact, we exhibit a hereditary property of graphs which iswell-quasi-ordered by the induced subgraph order and defined by finitely manyminimal forbidden induced subgraphs yet is not $2$-well-quasi-ordered. thiscounterexample is based on the widdershins spiral, which has received somestudy in the area of permutation patterns.
