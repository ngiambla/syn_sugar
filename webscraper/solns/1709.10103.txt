in the complex setting, let $f(x,y,y')=0$ be an analytic or algebraicdifferential equation with $y'$-degree $d$. we deal with the qualitative studyof such equations through the geometry of the planar $d$-web generated by thegeneric family of integral curves. infinitesimal symmetries of theseconfigurations are discussed by using meromorphic connections methods "\`a lacartan-spencer".
