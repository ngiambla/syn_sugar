low latency is highly desirable for cloud services. to achieve low responsetime, stringent timing requirements are needed for task scheduling in alarge-scale server farm spanning thousands of servers. in this paper, weconduct an in-depth analysis for distributed join-the-idle-queue (jiq), apromising new approximation of an idealized task-scheduling algorithm. inparticular, we derive semi-closed form expressions for the delay performance ofdistributed jiq, and we propose a new variant of distributed jiq that offersclear advantages over alternative algorithms for large systems.
