in this paper, we show synchronization for a group of output passive agentsthat communicate with each other according to an underlying communication graphto achieve a common goal. we propose a distributed event-triggered controlframework that will guarantee synchronization and considerably decrease therequired communication load on the band-limited network. we define a generalbyzantine attack on the event-triggered multi-agent network system andcharacterize its negative effects on synchronization. the byzantine agents arecapable of intelligently falsifying their data and manipulating the underlyingcommunication graph by altering their respective control feedback weights. weintroduce a decentralized detection framework and analyze its steady-state andtransient performances. we propose a way of identifying individual byzantineneighbors and a learning-based method of estimating the attack parameters.lastly, we propose learning-based control approaches to mitigate the negativeeffects of the adversarial attack.
