the aim of this note is to study the measure-valued ricci tensor on smoothmetric measure space with boundary, which is a generalization of bakry-emery'smodified ricci tensor on weighted riemannian manifold. as an application, weoffer a new approach to study curvature-dimension condition of smooth metricmeasure space with boundary.
