this paper proposes distributed algorithms for multi-agent networks toachieve a solution in finite time to a linear equation $ax=b$ where $a$ hasfull row rank, and with the minimum $l_1$-norm in the underdetermined case(where $a$ has more columns than rows). the underlying network is assumed to beundirected and fixed, and an analytical proof is provided for the proposedalgorithm to drive all agents' individual states to converge to a common value,viz a solution of $ax=b$, which is the minimum $l_1$-norm solution in theunderdetermined case. numerical simulations are also provided as validation ofthe proposed algorithms.
