a distributed discrete-time algorithm is proposed for multi-agent networks toachieve a common least squares solution of a group of linear equations, inwhich each agent only knows some of the equations and is only able to receiveinformation from its nearby neighbors. for fixed, connected, and undirectednetworks, the proposed discrete-time algorithm results in each agents solutionestimate to converging exponentially fast to the same least squares solution.moreover, the convergence does not require careful choices of time-varyingsmall step sizes.
