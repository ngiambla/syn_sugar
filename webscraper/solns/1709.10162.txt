we define and study the global okounkov moment cone of a projective sphericalvariety x, generalizing both the global okounkov body and the moment body of xdefined by kaveh and khovanskii. under mild assumptions on x we show that theglobal okounkov moment cone of x is rational polyhedral. as a consequence, alsothe global okounkov body of x, with respect to a particular valuation, isrational polyhedral.
