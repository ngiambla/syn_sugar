an analogue of the wedderbur principal theorem (wpt) is considered for finitedimensional jordan superalgebras a with solvable radical n, such that n^2=0 anda/n is isomorphic to josp_n|2m(f), where f is an algebraicallly closed field ofcharacteristic zero. let's we prove that the wpt is valid under somerestrictions over the irreducible josp_n|2m(f)-bimodules contained in n, and itis shown with counter-examples that these restrictions can not be weakened.
