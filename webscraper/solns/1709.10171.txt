a class of discrete-time nonlinear positive time-delay switched systems withsector-type nonlinearities is studied. sufficient conditions for the existenceof common and switched diagonal lyapunov--krasovskii functionals for thissystem class are derived; these are expressed as feasibility conditions forsystems of linear algebraic inequalities. corresponding spectral conditions forthe existence of common l--k functionals are also described. furthermore, it isshown that the proposed approaches can be applied to discrete-time models ofdigital filters and neural networks. finally, a numerical example is given toillustrate the effectiveness of theoretical results.
