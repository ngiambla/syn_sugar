we give congruences modulo powers of 2 for the fourier coefficients ofcertain level 2 modular functions with poles only at 0, answering a questionposed by andersen and the first author. the congruences involve a modulus thatdepends on the binary expansion of the modular form's order of vanishing at$\infty$.
