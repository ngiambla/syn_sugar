doran, jensen and giansiracusa showed a bijection between homogeneouselements in the cox ring of $\overline{m}_{0,n}$ not divisible by anyexceptional divisor section, and weighted pure-dimensional simplicial complexessatisfying a zero-tension condition. motivated by the study of the monoid ofeffective divisors, the pseudoeffective cone and the cox ring of$\overline{m}_{0,n}$, we point out a simplification of the zero-tensioncondition and study the space of balanced complexes. we give examples ofirreducible elements in the monoid of effective divisors of$\overline{m}_{0,n}$ for large $n$. in the case of $\overline{m}_{0,7}$, weclassify all such irreducible elements arising from nonsingular complexes andgive an example of how irreducibility can be shown in the singular case.
