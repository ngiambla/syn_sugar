given a stable siso lti system $g$, we investigate the problem of estimatingthe $\mathcal{h}_\infty$-norm of $g$, denoted $||g||_\infty$, when $g$ is onlyaccessible via noisy observations. wahlberg et al. recently proposed anonparametric algorithm based on the power method for estimating the topeigenvalue of a matrix. in particular, by applying a clever time-reversaltrick, wahlberg et al. implement the power method on the top left $n \times n$corner $t_n$ of the toeplitz (convolution) operator associated with $g$. inthis paper, we prove sharp non-asymptotic bounds on the necessary length $n$needed so that $||t_n||$ is an $\varepsilon$-additive approximation of$||g||_\infty$. furthermore, in the process of demonstrating the sharpness ofour bounds, we construct a simple family of finite impulse response (fir)filters where the number of timesteps needed for the power method isarbitrarily worse than the number of timesteps needed for parametric firidentification via least-squares to achieve the same $\varepsilon$-additiveapproximation.
