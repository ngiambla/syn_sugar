we define the notion of sequential gibbs measures, inspired by on theclassical notion of gibbs measures and recent examples from the study ofnon-uniform hyperbolic dynamics. extending previous results ofkempton-pollicott and ugalde-chazottes, we show that the images of one blockfactor maps of a sequential gibbs measure are also a sequential gibbs measure,with the same sequence of gibbs times. we obtain some estimates on theregularity of the potential of the image measure at almost every point.
