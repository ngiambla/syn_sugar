in this article, we will prove a full topological version of popa'smeasurable cocycle superrigidity theorem for full shifts. more precisely, weprove that every h\"older continuous cocycle for the full shifts of everyfinitely generated group $g$ that has one end, undistorted elements andsub-exponential divergence function is cohomologous to a group homomorphism viaa h\"older continuous transfer map if the target group is complete and admits acompatible bi-invariant metric. using the ideas of behrstock, dru\c {t}u,mosher, mozes and sapir, we show that the class of our acting groups is largeincluding wide groups having undistorted elements and one-ended groups withstrong thick of finite orders. as a consequence, irreducible uniform latticesof most of higher rank connected semisimple lie groups, mapping class groups of$g$-genus surfaces with $p$-punches, $g\geq 2, p\geq 0$, thompson group,$aut(f_n)$, $out(f_n)$, $n\geq3$, certain (2 dimensional)-coxeter groups, andone-ended right-angled artin groups are in our class. this partially extendsthe main result in our previous paper.
