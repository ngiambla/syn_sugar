in this paper, superconvergence points are located for the approximation ofthe riesz derivative of order $\alpha$ using classical lobatto-type polynomialswhen $\alpha \in (0,1)$ and generalized jacobi functions (gjf) for arbitrary$\alpha > 0$, respectively. for the former, superconvergence points are zerosof the riesz fractional derivative of the leading term in the truncatedlegendre-lobatto expansion. it is observed that the convergence rate fordifferent $\alpha$ at the superconvergence points is at least $o(n^{-2})$better than the optimal global convergence rate. furthermore, the interpolationis generalized to the riesz derivative of order $\alpha > 1$ with the help ofgjf, which deal well with the singularities. the well-posedness, convergenceand superconvergence properties are theoretically analyzed. the gain of theconvergence rate at the superconvergence points is analyzed to be$o(n^{-(\alpha+3)/2})$ for $\alpha \in (0,1)$ and $o(n^{-2})$ for $\alpha > 1$.finally, we apply our findings in solving model fdes and observe that theconvergence rates are indeed much better at the predicted superconvergencepoints.
