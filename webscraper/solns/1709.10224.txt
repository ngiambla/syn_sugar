in this article, we examine $l^2$ well-posedness and stabilization propertyof the dispersion-generalized benjamin-ono equation with periodic boundaryconditions. the main ingredient of our proof is a development ofdissipation-normalized bourgain space, which gains smoothing propertiessimultaneously from dissipation and dispersion within the equation. we willestablish a bilinear estimate for the derivative nonlinearity using this spaceand prove the linear observability inequality leading to small-datastabilization.
