in this paper, we give the strong unique continuation property for a generaltwo dimensional anisotropic elliptic system with real coefficients in a gevreyclass under the assumption that the principal symbol of the system has simplecharacteristics. the strong unique continuation property is derived byobtaining some carleman estimate. the derivation of the carleman estimate isbased on transforming the system to a larger second order elliptic system withdiagonal principal part which has complex coefficients.
