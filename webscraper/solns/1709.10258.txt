let $e$ be a finite set and $\mathcal p$, $\mathcal s$, $\mathcal l$ threeclasses of subsets of $e$, and $r$ a function defined on $2^e$. in this paper,we give an algorithm for testing if the quadruple $(\mathcal p, \mathcal s,\mathcal l, r)$ is the locked structure of a given matroid, i.e., recognizingif $(\mathcal p, \mathcal s, \mathcal l, r)$ defines a matroid. this problem isintractable. our algorithm improves the running time complexity of a previousalgorithm due to spinrad. we deduce a polynomial time algorithm for recognizinglarge classes of matroids called polynomially locked matroids and uniformmatroids.
