let $x$ be a complete intersection inside a variety $m$ with finitedimensional motive and for which the lefschetz-type conjecture $b(m)$ holds. weshow how conditions on the niveau filtration on the homology of $x$ influencedirectly the niveau on the level of chow groups. this leads to a generalizationof voisin's result. the latter states that if $m$ has trivial chow groups andif $x$ has non-trivial variable cohomology parametrized by $c$-dimensionalalgebraic cycles, then the cycle class maps $a_k(x) \to h_{2k}(x)$ areinjective for $k<c$. we give variants involving group actions which lead toseveral new examples with finite dimensional chow motives.
