this paper develops further the theory of the automorphic group ofnon-constant entire functions. this theory has already a long history thatessentially started with two remarkable papers of tatsujir\^o shimizu that werepublished in 1931. the elements $\phi(z)$ of the group are defined by theautomorphic equation $f(\phi(z))=f(z)$, were $f(z)$ is entire. tatsujir\^oshimizu also refers to the functions of this group as those functions that aredetermined by $f^{-1}\circ f$. he proved many remarkable properties of thoseautomorphic functions. he indicated how they induce a beautiful geometricstructure on the complex plane. those structures were termed by tatsujir\^oshimizu, the system of normal polygonal domains, and the more refined system ofthe fundamental domains of $f(z)$. the last system if exists tiles up thecomplex plane with remarkable geometric tiles that are conformally mapped toone another by the automorphic functions. in the ph.d thesis of the author,those tiles were also called the system of the maximal domains of $f(z)$. onecan not avoid noticing the many similarities between this automorphic group andits accompanying geometric structures and analytic properties, and the moretame discrete groups that appear in the theory of hyperbolic geometry and alsothe arithmetic groups in number theory. this paper pursues further the theoryinitiated by tatsujir\^o shimizu, towards understanding global properties ofthe automorphic group, rather than just understanding the properties of theindividual automorphic functions. we hope to be able in sequel papers togeneralize arithmetic and analytic tools such as the selberg trace formula, tothis new setting.
