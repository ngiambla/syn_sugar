this paper develops further the theory of the automorphic group ofnon-constant entire functions. this theory essentially started with tworemarkable papers of tatsujir\^o shimizu that were published in 1931. there arethree results in this paper. the first result is that the ${\rm aut}(f)$-orbitof any complex number has no finite accumulation point. the second result is anaccurate computation of the derivative of an automorphic function of an entirefunction at any of its fixed points. the third result gives the precise form ofan automorphic function that is uniform over an open subset of $\mathbb{c}$.this last result is a follow up of a remarkable theorem of shimizu. it is asharp form of his result. it leads to an algorithm of computing the entireautomorphic functions of entire functions. the complexity is computed using anheight estimate of a rational parameter discovered by shimizu.
