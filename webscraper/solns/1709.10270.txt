factoring ideals in integral domains is a central topic in multiplicativeideal theory. in the present paper we study monoids of ideals and considerfactorizations of ideals into multiplicatively irreducible ideals. the focus ison the monoid of nonzero divisorial ideals and on the monoid of $v$-invertibledivisorial ideals in weakly krull mori domains. under suitable algebraicfiniteness conditions we establish arithmetical finiteness results, inparticular for the monotone catenary degree and for the structure of sets oflengths and of their unions.
