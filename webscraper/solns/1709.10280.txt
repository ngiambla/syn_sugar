storage and transmission in big data are discussed in this paper, wheremessage importance is taken into account. similar to shannon entropy and renyientropy, we define non-parametric message important measure (nmim) as a measurefor the message importance in the scenario of big data, which can characterizethe uncertainty of random events. it is proved that the proposed nmim cansufficiently describe two key characters of big data: rare events finding andlarge diversities of events. based on nmim, we first propose an effectivecompressed encoding mode for data storage, and then discuss the channeltransmission over some typical channel models. numerical simulation resultsshow that using our proposed strategy occupies less storage space withoutlosing too much message importance, and there are growth region and saturationregion for the maximum transmission, which contributes to designing of betterpractical communication system.
