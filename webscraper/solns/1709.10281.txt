in probability theory and statistics, the iid model represents a singlepopulation, and a large, potentially infinite sample from this population. maintheorems, in particular the central limit theorem and laws of large number(lln) assure convergence, making asymptotic statistics possible.  to avoid convergence, it is thus straightforward to consider two populationsand a sample that ceaselessly fluctuates between them. it is the aim of thiscontribution to study the effects that thus occur. to this end, we introduce"progressive sampling," leading to a straightforward model that is analyticallytractable. with a minimum of technical overhead, a number of interestingresults thus ensue:  in particular, one encounters a multiplicate structure (similar to pascal'striangle) that is associated with a new class of distributions (related to thebinomial). although the argument is completely probabilistic, it entails awell-known fractal structure. it also turns out that the new (global) operationof "weaving" is equivalent to a certain (local) cascade process.
