we extend some of the results proved for scalar equations in [3,4], to thecase of systems of integrable conservation laws. in particular, for suchsystems we prove that the eigenvalues of a matrix obtained from the quasilinearpart of the system are invariants under miura transformations and we show howthese invariants are related to dispersion relations. furthermore, focusing onone-parameter families of dispersionless systems of integrable conservationlaws associated to the coxeter groups of rank $2$ found in [1], we study thecorresponding integrable deformations up to order $2$ in the deformationparameter $\epsilon$. each family contains both bi-hamiltonian andnon-hamiltonian systems of conservation laws and therefore we use it to probeto which extent the properties of the dispersionless limit impact the natureand the existence of integrable deformations. it turns out that a part twovalues of the parameter all deformations of order one in $\epsilon$ aremiura-trivial, while all those of order two in $\epsilon$ are essentiallyparameterized by two arbitrary functions of single variables (the riemanninvariants) both in the bi-hamiltonian and in the non-hamiltonian case. in thetwo remaining cases, due to the existence of non-trivial first orderdeformations, there is an additional functional parameter.
