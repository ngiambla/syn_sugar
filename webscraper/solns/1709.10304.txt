we consider complements of standard seifert surfaces of special alternatinglinks. on these handlebodies, we use honda's method to enumerate those tightcontact structures whose dividing sets are isotopic to the link, and find theirnumber to be the leading coefficient of the alexander polynomial. the eulerclasses of the contact structures are identified with hypertrees in a certainhypergraph. using earlier work, this establishes a connection between contacttopology and the homfly polynomial. we also show that the contact invariants ofour tight contact structures form a basis for sutured floer homology. finally,we relate our methods and results to kauffman's formal knot theory.
