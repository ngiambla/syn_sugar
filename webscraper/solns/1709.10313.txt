we consider the rosenzweig-porter model $h = v + \sqrt{t}\, \phi$, where $v$is a $n \times n$ diagonal matrix, $\phi$ is drawn from the $n \times n$gaussian orthogonal ensemble, and $n^{-1} \ll t \ll 1$. we prove that theeigenfunctions of $h$ are typically supported in a set of approximately $nt$sites, thereby confirming the existence of a previously conjectured non-ergodicdelocalized phase. our proof is based on martingale estimates along thecharacteristic curves of the stochastic advection equation satisfied by thelocal resolvent of the brownian motion representation of $h$.
