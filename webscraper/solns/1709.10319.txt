a four dimensional ecoepidemiological model consisting of susceptible prey,infected prey, vaccinated prey and predator is formulated and analyzed in thepresent work. the functional response is assumed to be of lotka-volterra type.we studied systematically the behavior of the model with and without disease inprey. we analyzed mathematically the dynamics of the system such as boundednessof the solutions, existence and stability conditions of equilibria. the basicreproduction number \mathcal{r}_0 for the proposed model is computed. diseaseis endemic if \mathcal{r}_0>1. numerical simulations are also carried out forthe analytical results.
