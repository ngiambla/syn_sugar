in this work, we consider germs of analytic singular vector elds in (c^3,0)with an isolated and doubly-resonant singularity of saddle-node type at theorigin. such vector elds come from irregular two-dimensional dierential systemswith two opposite non-zero eigenvalues, and appear for instance when studyingthe irregular singularity at innity in painlev{\'e} equations (p j) j=i,...,vfor generic values of the parameters. under suitable assumptions, we prove atheorem of analytic normalization over sectorial domains, analogous to theclassical one due to hukuhara-kimura-matuda for saddle-nodes in (c^2,0). wealso prove that these maps are in fact the gevrey-1 sums of the formalnormalizing map, the existence of which has been proved in a previous paper.finally we provide an analytic classication under the action of bereddieomorphisms, based on the study of the so-called stokes dieomorphismsobtained by comparing consecutive sectorial normalizing maps {\`a} lamartinet-ramis / stolovitch for 1-resonant vector fields.
