for each two-dimensional vector space $v$ of commuting $n\times n$ matricesover a field $\mathbb f$ with at least 3 elements, we denote by $\widetilde v$the vector space of all $(n+1)\times(n+1)$ matrices of the form$\left[\begin{smallmatrix}a&*\\0&0\end{smallmatrix}\right]$ with $a\in v$. weprove the wildness of the problem of classifying lie algebras $\widetilde v$with the bracket operation $[u,v]:=uv-vu$. we also prove the wildness of theproblem of classifying two-dimensional vector spaces consisting of commutinglinear operators on a vector space over a field.
