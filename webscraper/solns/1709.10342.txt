in the homogeneous case, the only curvature behavior which is still far frombeing understood is ricci negative. in this paper, we study which nilpotent liealgebras admit a ricci negative solvable extension. different unexpectedbehaviors were found. on the other hand, given a nilpotent lie algebra, weconsider the space of all the derivations such that the corresponding solvableextension has a metric with negative ricci curvature. using the nice convexityproperties of the moment map for the variety of nilpotent lie algebras, weobtain a useful characterization of such derivations and some applications.
