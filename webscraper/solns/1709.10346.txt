in this work we prove an universality result regarding the equidistributionof zeros of random holomorphic sections associated to a sequence of singularhermitian holomorphic line bundles on a compact k\"ahler complex space $x$.namely, under mild moment assumptions, we show that the asymptotic distributionof zeros of random holomorphic sections is independent of the choice of theprobability measure on the space of holomorphic sections. in the case when $x$is a compact k\"ahler manifold, we also prove an off-diagonal exponential decayestimate for the bergman kernels of a sequence of positive line bundles on $x$.
