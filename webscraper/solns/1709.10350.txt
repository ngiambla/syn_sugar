let $\mathbb f$ be a field of characteristic not $2$, and let $(a,b)$ be apair of $n\times n$ matrices over $\mathbb f$, in which $a$ is symmetric and$b$ is skew-symmetric. a canonical form of $(a,b)$ with respect to congruencetransformations $(s^tas,s^tbs)$ was given by sergeichuk (1988) up toclassification of symmetric and hermitian forms over finite extensions of$\mathbb f$. we obtain a simpler canonical form of $(a,b)$ if $b$ isnonsingular. such a pair $(a,b)$ defines a quadratic form on a symplecticspace, that is, on a vector space with scalar product given by a nonsingularskew-symmetric form. as an application, we obtain known canonical matrices ofquadratic forms and hamiltonian operators on real and complex symplecticspaces.
