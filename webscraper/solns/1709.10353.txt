we propose a population model for hiv-tb co-infection dynamics by consideringtreatments for hiv infection, active tuberculosis and coinfection. the hiv onlyand tb only models are analyzed separately, as well as full model. the basicreproduction numbers for tb \mathcal{r}_0^t and hiv \mathcal{r}_0^h and overallreproduction number for the system \mathcal{r}_0= \max\{\mathcal{r}_0^t,\mathcal{r}_0^h\} are computed. the equilibria and their stability are studied.we explore the effect of early and late hiv treatment on disease induced deathduring the tb treatment course. mathematical analysis of our model shows thatsuccessful disease eradication requires treatment of single disease, that is,treatment for hiv only and tb only infected individuals with addition toco-infection treatment.
