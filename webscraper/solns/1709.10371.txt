in this paper, we investigate a novel family of polar codes based onmulti-kernel constructions, proving that this construction actually polarizes.to this end, we derive a new and more general proof of polarization, whichgives sufficient conditions for kernels to polarize. finally, we derive theconvergence rate of the multi-kernel construction and relate it to theconvergence rate of each of the constituent kernels.
