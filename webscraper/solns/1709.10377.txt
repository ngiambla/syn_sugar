quite a few studies on real-world applications of multi-objectiveoptimization reported that their pareto sets and pareto fronts form atopological simplex. such a class of problems was recently named the simpleproblems, and their pareto set and pareto front were observed to have a gluingstructure similar to the faces of a simplex. this paper gives a theoreticaljustification for that observation by proving the gluing structure of thepareto sets/fronts of subproblems of a simple problem. the simplicity ofstandard benchmark problems is studied.
