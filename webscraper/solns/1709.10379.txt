component-based design is a different way of constructing systems whichoffers numerous benefits, in particular, decreasing the complexity of systemdesign. however, deploying components into a system is a challenging anderror-prone task. model checking is one of the reliable methods thatautomatically and systematically analyse the correctness of a given system. itsbrute-force check of the state space significantly expands the level ofconfidence in the system. nevertheless, model checking is limited by a criticalproblem so-called state space explosion (sse). to benefit from model checking,appropriate methods to reduce sse, is required. in two last decades, a greatnumber of methods to mitigate the state space explosion have been proposedwhich have many similarities, dissimilarities, and unclear concepts in somecases. this research, firstly, aims at present a review and brief discussion ofthe methods of handling sse problem and classify them based on theirsimilarities, principle and characteristics. second, it investigates themethods for handling sse problem in verifying component-based system (cbs) andprovides insight into cbs verification limitations that have not been addressedyet. the analysis in this research has revealed the patterns, specificfeatures, and gaps in the state-of-the-art methods. in addition, we identifiedand discussed suitable methods to soften sse problem in cbs and underlined thekey challenges for future research efforts.
