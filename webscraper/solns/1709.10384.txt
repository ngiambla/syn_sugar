we prove existence, uniqueness, and regularity of viscosity solutions to thestationary and evolution obstacle problems defined by a class of nonlocaloperators that are not stable-like and may have supercritical drift. we givesufficient conditions on the coefficients of the operator to obtain h\"olderand lipschitz continuous solutions. the class of nonlocal operators that weconsider include non-gaussian asset price models widely used in mathematicalfinance, such as variance gamma processes and regular l\'evy processes ofexponential type. in this context, the viscosity solutions that we analyzecoincide with the prices of perpetual and finite expiry american options.
