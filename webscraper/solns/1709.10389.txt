we study convex polyhedra in $\mathbb{r}\mathbb{p}^3$ with all their verticeson a sphere. we do not require, in particular, that the polyhedra lie in theinterior of the sphere, hence the term "weakly inscribed". such polyhedra canbe interpreted as ideal polyhedra, if we regard $\mathbb{r}\mathbb{p}^3$ as acombination of the hyperbolic space and the de sitter space, with the sphere asthe common ideal boundary. we have three main results: (1) the $1$-skeleta ofweakly inscribed polyhedra are characterized in a purely combinatorial way, (2)the exterior dihedral angles are characterized by linear programming, and (3)we also describe the hyperbolic-de sitter structure induced on the boundary ofweakly inscribed polyhedra.
