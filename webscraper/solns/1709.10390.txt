as shown by mcmullen and morelli, the coefficients of the ehrhart polynomialof a lattice polytope can be written as a weighted sum of facial volumes. theweights in such a local formula depend only on the outer normal cones of faces,but are far from being unique. in this paper, we develop a new class of suchlocal formulas, based on polyhedral volume computations. we hereby also obtaina kind of geometric interpretation for the ehrhart coefficients. since ourconstruction depends on the choice of fundamental domains for the sublatticesof the given lattice, we obtain a great variety of possible local formulas.these can for instance be chosen to fit well with a given polyhedral symmetrygroup. in contrast to other constructions of local formulas, ours does not relyon a valuation property, respectively on triangulations of rational cones intosimplicial or even unimodular ones.
