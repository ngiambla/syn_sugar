a. v. arhangel'ski\u{i} introduced in 2012, when he was visiting thedepartment of mathematics at king abduaziz university, new weaker versions ofnormality, called \it $c$-normality, \rm and \it countable normality. \rm thepurpose of this paper is to investigate countable normality property. we provethat normality implies countable normality but the converse is not true ingeneral. we present some examples to show relationships between countablenormality and other weaker versions of normality such as $c$-normality,$l$-noramlity, and mild normality. we answer the following open problem ofarhangel'ski\u{i}: "is there a tychonoff space which is not $c$-normal ?".  throughout this paper, we denote an ordered pair by $\langle x,y\rangle$, theset of positive integers by $\mathbb{n}$ and the set of real numbers by$\mathbb{r}$. a $t_4$ space is a $t_1$ normal space, a tychonoff space is a$t_1$ completely regular space, and a $t_3$ space is a $t_1$ regular space. wedo not assume $t_2$ in the definition of compactness and we do not assumeregularity in the definition of lindel\"ofness. for a subset $a$ of a space$x$, ${\rm int} a$ and $\overline{a}$ denote the interior and the closure of$a$, respectively. an ordinal $\gamma$ is the set of all ordinals $\alpha$ suchthat $\alpha<\gamma$. the first infinite ordinal is $\omega_0$, the firstuncountable ordinal is $\omega_1$, and the successor cardinal of $\omega_1$ is$\omega_2$.
