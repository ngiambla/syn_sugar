unified power flow controller (upfc) is recognized as the most powerfulflexible ac transmission systems (facts) device for power system operation.this paper addresses how upfc explores the transmission flexibility andfacilitates the integration of uncertain and volatile wind power generation. tothis end, a comprehensive unit commitment (uc) model with upfc and uncertainwind power generation is proposed. then, some metrics are introduced toevaluate the impacts of upfc on the reliability, security and economy of powersystem operation. further, different dispatch strategies of upfc are comparedto provide helpful guidances on making full use of upfc to hedge againstuncertainties. in addition, facing the challenging mixed-integer non-linearnon-convex problems, approximate models are proposed to provide a startingpoint to solve the problems efficiently. all these models are easy to adapt toother types of facts devices. illustrative numerical results are provided.
