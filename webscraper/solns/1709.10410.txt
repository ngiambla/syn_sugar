the problem of stabilization of unstable periodic orbits of discretenonlinear systems is considered in the article. a new generalization of thedelayed feedback, which solves the stabilization problem, is proposed. thefeedback is represented as a convex combination of nonlinear feedback andsemilinear feedback introduced by o. morgul. in this article, the o. morgulmethod was transferred from the scalar case to the vector one. it is shown thatthe additional introduction of the semilinear feedback into the equation makesit possible to significantly reduce the length of the prehistory used in thecontrol and to increase the rate of convergence of the perturbed solutions toperiodic ones. as an application of the proposed stabilization scheme, apossible computational algorithm for finding solutions of systems of algebraicequations is given. the numerical simulation results are presented.
