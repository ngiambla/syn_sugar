timing detection is the first step and very important in wirelesscommunication systems. timing detection performance is usually affected by thefrequency offset. therefore, it is a challenge to design the synchronizationsignal in massive narrowband internet of things (nb-iot) scenarios where thefrequency offset is usually large due to the low cost requirement. in thispaper, we firstly proposed a new general synchronization signal structure witha couple of sequences which are conjugated to remove the potential timing errorarose from large frequency offset. then, we analyze the suitable sequence forour proposed synchronization signal structure and discuss a special zc sequenceas an example. finally, the simulation results demonstrate our proposedsynchronization signal can work well when the frequency offset is large. itmeans that our proposed synchronization signal design is very suitable for themassive nb-iot.
