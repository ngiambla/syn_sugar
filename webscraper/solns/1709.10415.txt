the fractional laplacian $\delta^{\beta/2}$ is the generator of$\beta$-stable l\'evy process, which is the scaling limit of the l\'evy fight.due to the divergence of the second moment of the jump length of the l\'evyfight it is not appropriate as a physical model in many practical applications.however, using a parameter $\lambda$ to exponentially temper the isotropicpower law measure of the jump length leads to the tempered l\'evy fight, whichhas finite second moment. for short time the tempered l\'evy fight exhibits thedynamics of l\'evy fight while after sufficiently long time it turns to normaldiffusion. the generator of tempered $\beta$-stable l\'evy process is thetempered fractional laplacian $(\delta+\lambda)^{\beta/2}$ [w.h. deng, b.y. li,w.y. tian, and p.w. zhang, multiscale model. simul., in press, 2017]. in thecurrent work, we present new computational methods for the tempered fractionallaplacian equation, including the cases with the homogeneous and nonhomogeneousgeneralized dirichlet type boundary conditions. we prove the well-posedness ofthe galerkin weak formulation and provide convergence analysis of the singlescaling b-spline and multiscale riesz bases finite element methods. we proposea technique for efficiently generating the entries of the dense stiffnessmatrix and for solving the resulting algebraic equation by preconditioning. wealso present several numerical experiments to verify the theoretical results.
