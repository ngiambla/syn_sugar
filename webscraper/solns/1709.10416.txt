this work continues the study of residually wild morphisms $f\colon y\to x$of berkovich curves initiated by cohen, temkin and trushin in [ctt16]. thedifferent function $\delta_f$ introduced in [ctt16] is the primary discreteinvariant of such covers. when $f$ is not residually tame, it provides anon-trivial enhancement of the classical invariant of $f$ consisting ofmorphisms of reductions $\widetilde{f}\colon \widetilde{y}\to\widetilde{x}$ andmetric skeletons $\gamma_f\colon \gamma_y\to\gamma_x$. in this paper weinterpret $\delta_f$ as the norm of the canonical trace section $\tau_f$ of thedualizing sheaf $\omega_f$, and introduce a finer reduction invariant$\widetilde{\tau}_f$, which is (loosely speaking) a section of$\omega_{\widetilde{f}}^{\rm log}$. our main result generalizes a liftingtheorem of amini-baker-brugall\'e-rabinoff from the case of residually tamemorphism to the case of minimally residually wild morphisms. for such morphismswe describe all restrictions the datum$(\widetilde{f},\gamma_f,\delta|_{\gamma_y},\widetilde{\tau}_f)$ satisfies, andprove that, conversely, any quadruple satisfying these restrictions can belifted to a morphism of berkovich curves.
