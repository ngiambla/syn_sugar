we present new linear energy stable numerical schemes for numericalsimulation of complex polymer-solvent mixtures. the mathematical model proposedby zhou, zhang and e physical review e 73 (2006) consists of the cahn-hilliardequation which describes dynamics of the interface that separates polymer andsolvent and the oldroyd-b equations for the hydrodynamics of polymericmixtures. the model is thermodynamically consistent and dissipates free energy.our main goal in this paper is to derive numerical schemes for thepolymer-solvent mixture model that are energy dissipative and efficient intime. to this end we will propose several problem-suited time discretizationsyielding linear schemes and discuss their properties.
