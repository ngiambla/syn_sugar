we prove upper and lower bounds for the number of lines in general positionthat are rich in a cartesian product point set. this disproves a conjecture ofsolymosi and improves work of elekes, borenstein and croot, and amirkhanyan,bush, croot, and pryby.  the upper bounds are based on a version of the asymmetricbalog-szemeredi-gowers theorem for group actions combined with product theoremsfor the affine group. the lower bounds are based on a connection between richlines in cartesian product sets and amenability (or expanding families ofgraphs in the finite field case).  as an application of our upper bounds for rich lines in grids, we give ageometric proof of the asymmetric sum-product estimates of bourgain andshkredov.
