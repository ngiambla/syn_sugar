we consider consistent dynamics for non-intersecting birth and death chains,originating from dualities of stochastic coalescing flows and one dimensionalorthogonal polynomials. as corollaries, we obtain unified and simpleprobabilistic proofs of certain key intertwining relations between multivariatemarkov chains on the levels of some branching graphs. special cases include thedynamics on the gelfand-tsetlin graph considered by borodin and olshanski andthe ones on the bc-type graph recently studied by cuenca. moreover, weintroduce a general inhomogeneous random growth process with a wall thatincludes as special cases the ones considered by borodin and kuan and cerenzia,that are related to the representation theory of classical groups and also thejacobi growth process more recently studied by cerenzia and kuan. its mostimportant feature is that, this process retains the determinantal structure ofthe ones studied previously and for the fully packed initial condition we areable to calculate its correlation kernel explicitly in terms of a contourintegral involving orthogonal polynomials. at a certain scaling limit, at afinite distance from the wall, one obtains for a single level discretedeterminantal ensembles associated to continuous orthogonal polynomials, thatwere recently introduced by borodin and olshanski, and that depend on theinhomogeneities.
