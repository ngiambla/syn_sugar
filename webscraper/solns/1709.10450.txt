given a smooth variety $y$ with an action of a finite group $g$, and asemiorthogonal decomposition of the derived category, $\mathcal{d}[y/g]$, of$g$-equivariant coherent sheaves on $y$ into subcategories equivalent toderived categories of smooth varieties, we construct a similar semiorthogonaldecomposition for a smooth $g$-invariant divisor in $y$ (under certaintechnical assumptions). combining this procedure with the semiorthogonaldecompositions constructed in [pv15], we construct semiorthogonaldecompositions of some equivariant derived categories of smooth projectivehypersurfaces.
