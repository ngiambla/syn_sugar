we remark that sparse and carleson coefficients are equivalent for everycountable collection of borel sets and hence, in particular, for dyadicrectangles, the case relevant to the theory of bi-parameter singular integrals.  the key observation is that a dual refomulation by i. e. verbitsky forcarleson coefficients over dyadic cubes holds also for carleson coefficientsover general sets. we give a simple proof for this reformulation.
