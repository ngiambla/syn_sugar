we construct several families of radial solutions for the stationarykeller-segel equation in the disk. the first family consists in solutions whichblow up at the origin, as a parameter goes to zero, and concentrate on theboundary. the second is made of solutions which blow up at the origin andconcentrate on an interior sphere, while the solutions of the third family blowup at the origin and concentrate simultaneously on an interior sphere and onthe boundary. finally, we also show how to construct more families ofmulti-layered radial solutions provided a suitable non degeneracy assumption issatisfied.
