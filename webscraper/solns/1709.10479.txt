scattering on a resonance state coupled to a complicated background is atypical problem for mesoscopic quantum many-body systems as well as for wavepropagation in the presence of a complex environment. on average, such a simplemode acquires an effective damping, the so-called "spreading" width, due tomixing with the background states. modelling the latter by random matrix theoryand employing the strength function formalism, we derive the joint distributionof the reflection and total transmission at arbitrary absorption in thebackground. the distribution is found to possess a remarkable symmetry betweenits reflection and transmission sectors, which is controlled by the ratio ofthe spreading to escape width. this in turn results in a symmetry relationbetween the marginal densities, despite the absence of the flux conservationlaw at finite absorption. as an application, we study the statistics of totallosses in the system at arbitrary coupling to the background.
