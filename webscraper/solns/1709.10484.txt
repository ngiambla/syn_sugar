in this article, we develop a notion of quillen bifibration which combinesthe two notions of grothendieck bifibration and of quillen model structure. inparticular, given a bifibration $p:\mathcal e\to\mathcal b$, we describe when afamily of model structures on the fibers $\mathcal e_a$ and on the basiscategory $\mathcal b$ combines into a model structure on the total category$\mathcal e$, such that the functor $p$ preserves cofibrations, fibrations andweak equivalences. using this grothendieck construction for model structures,we revisit the traditional definition of reedy model structures, and possiblegeneralizations, and exhibit their bifibrational nature.
