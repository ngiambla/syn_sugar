in this paper we study the $\mathbb z/2$ action on real grassmann manifolds$g_{n}(\mathbb r^{2n})$ and $\widetilde{g}_{n}(\mathbb r^{2n})$ given by taking(appropriately oriented) orthogonal complement. we completely evaluate therelated $\mathbb z/2$ fadell--husseini index utilizing a novel computation ofthe stiefel--whitney classes of the wreath product of a vector bundle. theseresults are used to establish the following geometric result about theorthogonal shadows of a convex body: for $n=2^a (2 b+1)$, $k=2^{a+1}-1$, $c$ aconvex body in $\mathbb r^{2n}$, and $k$ real valued functions$\alpha_1,\ldots,\alpha_k$ continuous on convex bodies in $\mathbb r^{2n}$ withrespect to the hausdorff metric, there exists a subspace $v\subseteq\mathbbr^{2n}$ such that projections of $c$ to $v$ and its orthogonal complement$v^{\perp}$ have the same value with respect to each function $\alpha_i$, whichis $\alpha_i (p_v(c))=\alpha_i (p_{v^\perp} (c))$ for all $1\leq i\leq k$.
