the purpose of this note is to study the weak solutions to the inviscidquasi-geostrophic system for initial data belonging to lebesgue spaces. we givea global existence result as well as detail the connections between severaldifferent notions of weak solutions. in addition, we give a condition underwhich the energy of the system is conserved.
