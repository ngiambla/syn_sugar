we study existence and long-time behaviour of strong solutions for the thinfilm equation using a priori estimates in a weighted sobolev space. thisequation can be classified as a doubly degenerate fourth-order parabolic and itmodels coating flow on the outer surface of a sphere. it is shown that thestrong solution asymptotically decays to the flat profile.
