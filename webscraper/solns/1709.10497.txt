sapirovskii [18] proved that $|x|\leq\pi\chi(x)^{c(x)\psi(x)}$, for a regularspace $x$. we introduce the $\theta$-pseudocharacter of a urysohn space $x$,denoted by $\psi_\theta (x)$, and prove that the previous inequality holds forurysohn spaces replacing the bounds on celluarity $c(x)\leq\kappa$ and onpseudocharacter $\psi(x)\leq\kappa$ with a bound on urysohn cellularity$uc(x)\leq\kappa$ (which is a weaker conditon because $uc(x)\leq c(x)$) and on$\theta$-pseudocharacter $\psi_\theta (x)\leq\kappa$ respectivly (note that ingeneral $\psi(\cdot)\leq\psi_\theta (\cdot)$ and in the class of regular spaces$\psi(\cdot)=\psi_\theta(\cdot)$). further, in [6] the authors generalized thedissanayake and willard's inequality: $|x|\leq 2^{al_{c}(x)\chi(x)}$, forhausdorff spaces $x$ [25], in the class of $n$-hausdorff spaces and de groot'sresult: $|x|\leq 2^{hl(x)}$, for hausdorff spaces [11], in the class of $t_1$spaces (see theorems 2.22 and 2.23 in [6]). in this paper we restate theorem2.22 in [6] in the class of $n$-urysohn spaces and give a variation of theorem2.23 in [6] using new cardinal functions, denoted by $uw(x)$, $\psiw_\theta(x)$, $\theta\hbox{-}al(x)$, $h\theta\hbox{-}al(x)$,$\theta\hbox{-}al_c(x)$ and $\theta\hbox{-}al_{\theta}(x)$. in [5] the authorsintroduced the hausdorff point separating weight of a space $x$ denoted by$hpsw(x)$ and proved a hausdorff version of charlesworth's inequality $|x|\leqpsw(x)^{l(x)\psi(x)}$ [7]. in this paper, we introduce the urysohn pointseparating weight of a space $x$, denoted by $upsw(x)$, and prove that $|x|\lequpsw(x)^{\theta\hbox{-}al_{c}(x)\psi(x)}$, for a urysohn space $x$.
