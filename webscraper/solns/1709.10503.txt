we determine c-special subgroups of the bianchi groups of index bounded aboveby 120 by effectivising the arguments of agol-long-reid. these subgroups arecongruence of level 2 or 4 and retract to the free group on two generators. asa consequence, we find a c-special 20-sheeted cover of the figure-eight knotcomplement. we also determine c-special congruence subgroups for a family ofcocompact arithmetic kleinian groups.
