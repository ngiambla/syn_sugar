random walks on dynamic graphs have received increasingly more attention overthe last decade from different academic communities. despite the relativelylarge literature very little is known about random walks that construct thegraph where they walk while moving around. in this paper we study one of thesimplest conceivable models of this kind, that works as follows: before everywalker step, with probability $p$ a new leaf is added to the vertex currentlyoccupied by the walker. the model grows trees and we call it the bernoulligrowth random walk (bgrw). we address the classical dichotomy betweenrecurrence and transience in bgrw and prove that the random walk is transientfor any $p \in (0,1]$.
