we prove a general lower bound on christoffel function on planar convexdomains in terms of a modification of the parallel section function of thedomain. for a certain class of planar convex domains, in combination with arecent general upper bound, this allows to compute the pointwise behavior ofchristoffel function. we illustrate this approach for the domains$\{(x,y):|x|^\alpha+|y|^\alpha\le1\}$, $1<\alpha<2$, and compute up to aconstant factor the required modification of the parallel section function,and, consequently, christoffel function at an arbitrary interior point of thedomain.
