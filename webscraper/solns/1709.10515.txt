we study self-avoiding walk on graphs whose automorphism group has atransitive nonunimodular subgroup. we prove that self-avoiding walk isballistic, that the bubble diagram converges at criticality, and that thecritical two-point function decays exponentially in the distance from theorigin. this implies that the critical exponent governing the susceptibilitytakes its mean-field value, and hence that the number of self-avoiding walks oflength $n$ is comparable to the $n$th power of the connective constant. we alsoprove that the same results hold for a large class of repulsive walk modelswith a self-intersection based interaction, including the weakly self-avoidingwalk. all these results apply in particular to the product $t_k \times\mathbb{z}^d$ of a $k$-regular tree ($k\geq 3$) with $\mathbb{z}^d$, for whichthese results were previously only known for large $k$.
