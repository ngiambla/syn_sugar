we develop the theory of smooth principal bundles for a smooth group $g$,using the framework of diffeological spaces. after giving new examples showingwhy arbitrary principal bundles cannot be classified, we define $d$-numerablebundles, the smooth analogs of numerable bundles from topology, and prove thatpulling back a $d$-numerable bundle along smoothly homotopic maps givesisomorphic pullbacks. we then define smooth structures on milnor's spaces $eg$and $bg$, show that $eg \to bg$ is a $d$-numerable principal bundle, and provethat it classifies all $d$-numerable principal bundles over any diffeologicalspace. we deduce analogous classification results for $d$-numerablediffeological bundles and vector bundles.
