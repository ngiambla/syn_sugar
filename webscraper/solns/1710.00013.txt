oleg viro introduced an invariant of rigid isotopy for real algebraic knotsand links in $\bbb{rp}^3$ which can be viewed as a first order vassilievinvariant. in this paper we classify real algebraic links of degree $d$ withthe maximal value of this invariant in its two versions: $w$ and $w_\lambda$.
