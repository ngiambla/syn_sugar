in a recent paper baker and bowler introduced matroids over hyperfields,offering a common generalization of matroids, oriented matroids, and linearsubspaces of based vector spaces. this paper introduces the notion of atopological hyperfield and explores the generalization of grassmannians andrealization spaces to this context, particularly in relating the (hyper)fieldsr and c to hyperfields arising in matroid theory and in tropical geometry.
