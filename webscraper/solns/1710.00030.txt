we consider the bifurcations of standing wave solutions to the nonlinearschr\"odinger equation (nls) posed on a quantum graph consisting of two ringsconnected by a single edge, the so-called dumbbell, recently studied bymarzuola and pelinovsky. the authors of that study found the ground stateundergoes two bifurcations, first a symmetry-breaking, and the second whichthey call a symmetry preserving bifurcation. we clarify the type of thesymmetric-preserving bifurcation and show that it is transcritical. we thenreduce the question, and show that the phenomena described in that paper can bereproduced in a simple discrete self-trapping equation on a combinatorial graphof bowtie shape. this allows for complete analysis both by geometric methodsand by parameterizing the full solution space. we then expand the question, anddescribe the bifurcations of all the standing waves of this system, which canbe classified into three families, and of which there exists a countablyinfinite set.
