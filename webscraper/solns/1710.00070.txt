we analyze the dual ramsey theorem for $k$ partitions and $\ell$ colors($\mathsf{drt}^k_\ell$) in the context of reverse math, effective analysis, andstrong reductions. over $\mathsf{rca}_0$, the dual ramsey theorem stated forbaire colorings is equivalent to the statement for clopen colorings and to apurely combinatorial theorem $\mathsf{cdrt}^k_\ell$.  when the theorem is stated for borel colorings and $k\geq 3$, the resultingprinciples are essentially relativizations of $\mathsf{cdrt}^k_\ell$. for each$\alpha$, there is a computable borel code for a $\delta^0_\alpha$ coloringsuch that any partition homogeneous for it computes $\emptyset^{(\alpha)}$ or$\emptyset^{(\alpha-1)}$ depending on whether $\alpha$ is infinite or finite.  for $k=2$, we present partial results giving bounds on the effective contentof the principle. a weaker version for $\delta^0_n$ reduced colorings isequivalent to $\mathsf{d}^n_2$ over $\mathsf{rca}_0+\mathsf{i}\sigma^0_{n-1}$and in the sense of strong weihrauch reductions.
