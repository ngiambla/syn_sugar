we consider a smooth closed surface $m$ of fixed genus $\geqslant 2$ with ariemannian metric $g$ of negative curvature with fixed total area. the secondauthor has shown that the topological entropy of geodesic flow for $g$ isgreater than or equal to the topological entropy for the metric of constantnegative curvature on $m$ with the same total area which is greater than orequal to the metric entropy with respect to the liouville measure of geodesicflow for $g$. equality holds only in the case of constant negative curvature.we prove that those are the only restrictions on the values of topological andmetric entropies for metrics of negative curvature.
