directional data are constrained to lie on the unit sphere of $\mathbb{r}^q$,for some $q\geq 2$. to address the lack of a natural ordering for such data,depth functions have been defined on spheres. however, the depths availableeither lack flexibility or are so computationally expensive that they can onlybe used for very small dimensions~$q$. in this work, we improve on this byintroducing a class of distance-based depths for directional data. irrespectiveof the distance adopted, these depths can easily be computed in highdimensions, too. we derive the main structural properties of the proposeddepths and study how they depend on the distance used. we discuss theasymptotic and robustness properties of the corresponding deepest points. weshow the practical relevance of the proposed depths in two inferentialapplications, related to (i) spherical location estimation and (ii) supervisedclassification. for both problems, we show through simulation studies thatdistance-based depths have strong advantages over their competitors.
