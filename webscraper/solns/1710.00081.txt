the use of correntropy as a similarity measure has been increasing indifferent scenarios due to the well-known ability to extract high-orderstatistic information from data. recently, a new similarity measure betweencomplex random variables was defined and called complex correntropy. based on agaussian kernel, it extends the benefits of correntropy to complex-valued data.however, its properties have not yet been formalized. this paper studies theproperties of this new similarity measure and extends this definition topositive-definite kernels. complex correntropy is applied to a channelequalization problem as good results are achieved when compared with otheralgorithms such as the complex least mean square (clms), complex recursiveleast squares (crls), and least absolute deviation (lad).
