many extremal problems for graphs have threshold graphs as their extremalexamples. for instance the current authors proved that for fixed $k\ge 1$,among all graphs on $n$ vertices with $m$ edges, some threshold graph has thefewest matchings of size $k$; indeed either the lex graph or the colex graph issuch an extremal example. in this paper we consider the problem of maximizingthe number of matchings in the class of threshold graphs. we prove that theminimizers are what we call \emph{almost alternating threshold graphs}.  we also discuss a problem with a similar flavor: which threshold graph hasthe fewest independent sets. here we are inspired by the result that among allgraphs on $n$ vertices and $m$ edges the lex graph has the most independentsets.
