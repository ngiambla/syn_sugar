moore digraphs, that is digraphs with out-degree $d$, diameter $k$ and orderequal to the moore bound $m(d,k) = 1 + d + d^2 + \dots +d^k$, arise in thestudy of optimal network topologies. in an attempt to find digraphs with a'moore-like' structure, attention has recently been devoted to the study ofsmall digraphs with minimum out-degree $d$ such that between any pair ofvertices $u,v$ there is at most one directed path of length $\leq k$ from $u$to $v$; such a digraph has order $m(d,k)+\epsilon $ for some small excess$\epsilon $. sillasen et al. have shown that there are no digraphs without-degree two and excess one. the present author has classified all digraphswith out-degree two and excess two. in this paper it is proven that there areno diregular digraphs with out-degree two and excess three for $k \geq 3$,thereby providing the first classification of digraphs with order three awayfrom the moore bound for a fixed out-degree.
