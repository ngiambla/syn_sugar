spectral and numerical properties of classes of random orthogonal butterflymatrices, as introduced by parker (1995), are discussed, including theuniformity of eigenvalue distributions. these matrices are important becausethe matrix-vector product with an $n$-dimensional vector can be performed in$o(n \log n)$ operations. and in the simplest situation, these random matricescoincide with haar measure on a subgroup of the orthogonal group. we discussother implications in the context of randomized linear algebra.
