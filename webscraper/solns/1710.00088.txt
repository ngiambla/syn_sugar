let $\pi(x;q,a)$ denote the number of primes up to $x$ that are congruent to$a$ modulo $q$. a prime number race, for fixed modulus $q$ and residue classes$a_1, \ldots, a_r$ investigates the system of inequalities $\pi(x;q,a_1) >\pi(x;q,a_2) > \cdots > \pi(x;q,a_r)$. the study of prime number races wasinitiated by chebyshev and further studied by many others, includinglittlewood, shanks-r\'{e}nyi, knapowski-turan, and kaczorowski. we expect thatthis system should have arbitrarily large solutions $x$, and moreover we expectthe same to be true no matter how we permute the residue classes $a_j$; if thisis the case, and if the logarithmic density of the set of such $x$ exists andis positive, the prime number race is called inclusive. in breakthroughresearch, rubinstein and sarnak proved conditionally that every prime numberrace is inclusive; they assumed not only the generalized riemann hypothesis butalso a strong statement about the linear independence of the zeros of dirichletl-functions. we show that the same conclusion can be reached assuming thegeneralized riemann hypothesis and a substantially weaker linear independencehypothesis. in fact, we can assume that almost all of the zeros may be involvedin $\mathbb{q}$-linear relations. this work makes use of a number of ideas fromprobability, the explicit formula from number theory, and the kronecker-weylequidistribution theorem.
