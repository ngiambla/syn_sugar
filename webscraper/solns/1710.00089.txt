we continue our study of the realization problem for prism manifolds. everyprism manifold can be parametrized by a pair of relatively prime integers $p>1$and $q$. we determine a complete list of prism manifolds $p(p, q)$ that can berealized by positive integral surgeries on knots in $s^3$ when $q>p$. themethodology undertaken to obtain the classification is similar to that of thecase $q<0$ in an earlier paper.
