electrical circuits made only of perfectly conductive wires can be seen aspartitions between finite sets. these are also known as "corelations" and arethe morphisms in the category $\mathrm{fincorel}$. the two-element set has twodifferent frobenius monoid structures in $\mathrm{fincorel}$. these twofrobenius monoids are related to "series" and "parallel" junctions, which areused to connect pairs of wires. we show that these frobenius monoids interactto form a "weak bimonoid" as defined by pastro and street. we conjecture apresentation for the subcategory of $\mathrm{fincorel}$ generated by themorphisms associated to these two frobenius monoids, which we call$\mathrm{fincorel}^{\circ}$. we are interested in "bond graphs," which arebuilt from series and parallel junctions. although the morphisms of$\mathrm{fincorel}^{\circ}$ resemble bond graphs, there is not a perfectcorrespondence. since bond graphs and circuits determine lagrangian relationsbetween symplectic vector spaces, we then consider the category of lagrangianrelations, $\mathrm{lagrel}_k$. bond graphs pick out a subcategory$\mathrm{lagrel}_k^{\circ}$ with generating morphisms corresponding to those of$\mathrm{fincorel}^{\circ}$. thus we define a category $\mathrm{bondgraph}$with generators and equations that are found in both$\mathrm{fincorel}^{\circ}$ and $\mathrm{lagrel}_k^{\circ}$. we study thefunctorial semantics of $\mathrm{bondgraph}$ by giving two different functorsfrom it to the category $\mathrm{lagrel}_k$ and a natural transformationbetween them. given a bond graph, the first functor picks out a lagrangianrelation in terms of "effort" and "flow," while the second picks one out interms of "potential" and "current." the natural transformation arises from theway that effort and flow relate to potential and current.
