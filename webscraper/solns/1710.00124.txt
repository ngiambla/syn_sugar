let $i(n)$ denote the number of isomorphism classes of subgroups of $(\bbbz/n\bbb z)^\times$, and let $g(n)$ denote the number of subgroups of $(\bbbz/n\bbb z)^\times$ counted as sets (not up to isomorphism). we prove that both$\log g(n)$ and $\log i(n)$ satisfy erd\"os-kac laws, in that suitablenormalizations of them are normally distributed in the limit. of note is that$\log g(n)$ is not an additive function but is closely related to the sum ofsquares of additive functions. we also establish the orders of magnitude of themaximal orders of $\log g(n)$ and $\log i(n)$.
