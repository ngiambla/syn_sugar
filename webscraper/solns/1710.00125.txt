the bunch-kaufman algorithm and aasen's algorithm are two of the most widelyused methods for solving symmetric indefinite linear systems, yet they both areknown to suffer from occasional numerical instability due to potentiallyexponential element growth or unbounded entries in the matrix factorization. inthis work, we develop a randomized complete pivoting (rcp) algorithm forsolving symmetric indefinite linear systems. rcp is comparable to thebunch-kaufman algorithm and aasen's algorithm in computational efficiency, yetenjoys theoretical element growth and bounded entries in the factorizationcomparable to that of complete-pivoting, up to a theoretical failureprobability that exponentially decays with an oversampling parameter. ourfinite precision analysis shows that rcp is as numerically stable as gaussianelimination with complete pivoting, and rcp has been observed to be numericallystable in our extensive numerical experiments.
