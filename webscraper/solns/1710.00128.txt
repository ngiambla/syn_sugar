delay coordinates are a widely used technique to pass from observations of adynamical system to a representation of the dynamical system as an embedding ineuclidean space. current proofs show that delay coordinates of a givendynamical system result in embeddings generically over a space of observations(sauer, yorke, casdagli, j. stat. phys., vol. 65 (1991), p. 579-616). motivatedby applications of the embedding theory, we consider the situation where theobservation function is fixed. for example, the observation function may simplybe some fixed coordinate of the state vector. for a fixed observation function(any nonzero linear combination of coordinates) and for the special case ofperiodic solutions, we prove that delay coordinates result in an embeddinggenerically over the space of flows in the $c^{r}$ topology with $r\geq2$.
