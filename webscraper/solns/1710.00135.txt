in this paper, we study the sharp constants of quantitative hardy and rellichinequalities on nonreversible finsler manifolds equipped with arbitrarymeasures. in particular, these inequalities can be globally refined by addingremainder terms like the brezis-v\'azquez improvement, if finsler manifolds areof strictly negative flag curvature, vanishing s-curvature and finiteuniformity constant. furthermore, these results remain valid when finslermetrics are reversible.
