let $p$ be a prime number. every $n$-variable polynomial $f(\underline x)$over a finite field of characteristic $p$ defines an artin--schreier--witttower of varieties whose galois group is isomorphic to $\mathbb{z}_p$. our goalof this paper is to study the newton polygon of the $l$-function associated toa finite character of $\mathbb{z}_p$ and a generic polynomial whose convex hullis an $n$-dimensional paralleltope $\delta$. we denote this polygon by$\mathrm{gnp}(\delta)$. we prove a lower bound of $\mathrm{gnp}(\delta)$, whichis called the improved hodge polygon $\mathrm{ihp}(\delta)$. we show that$\mathrm{ihp}(\delta)$ lies above the usual hodge polygon $\mathrm{hp}(\delta)$at certain infinitely many points, and when $p$ is larger than a fixed numberdetermined by $\delta$, it coincides with $\mathrm{gnp}(\delta)$ at thesepoints. as a corollary, we roughly determine the distribution of the slopes of$\mathrm{gnp}(\delta)$.
