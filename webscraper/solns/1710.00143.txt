in this paper, we introduce and investigate a new subclass of the functionclass $\sigma$ of bi-univalent functions defined in the open unit disk, whichare associated with the s\u{a}l\u{a}gean type $q-$ difference operator andsatisfy some subordination conditions. furthermore, we find estimates on thetaylor-maclaurin coefficients $|a_2|$ and $|a_3|$ for functions in the newsubclass introduced here. several (known or new) consequences of the resultsare also pointed out. further we obtain fekete-szeg$\ddot{o}$ inequality forthe new function class.
