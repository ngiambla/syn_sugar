in this paper, we are concerned with the compressible viscousmagnetohydrodynamic (mhd) system and investigate the large time behavior ofstrong solutions near constant equilibrium. in the eighties, umeda, kawashimaand shizuta initiated the dissipative mechanism for a rather general class ofsymmetric hyperbolic-parabolic systems. from the point of view ofdissipativity, kawashima in his doctoral dissertation established the optimaltime-decay estimates of $l^{q}$-$l^{2}(q\in [1,2)$) type for solutions to themhd system. here, we shall improve kawashima's efforts and give more precisedescription for the large time asymptotic behavior of solutions, not only inextra lebesgue spaces but also in a full family of besov norms with thenegative regularity index. precisely, we show that the $l^{p}$ norm (theslightly stronger $\dot{b}^{0}_{p,1}$ one in fact) of global solutions with thecritical regularity, decays like $t^{-d(\frac{1}{p}-\frac{1}{4})}$ for$t\rightarrow\infty$. in particular, taking $p=2$ and $d=3$ goes back to theclassical time decay $t^{-\frac{3}{4}}$. we derive new estimates which are usedto deal with the strong coupling between the magnetic field and fluid dynamics.
