in this paper, an integral equation representation for the early exerciseboundary of an american option contract is considered. thus far, a number ofdifferent techniques have been proposed in the literature to obtain a varietyof integral equation forms for the early exercise boundary, all starting fromthe black-scholes partial differential equation. we first present a coherentcategorization of exiting integral equation methodologies in the americanoption pricing literature. in the reminder and based on the fact that the earlyexercise boundary satisfies a fully nonlinear weakly singular non-standardvolterra integral equation, we propose a product integration approach based onlinear barycentric rational interpolation to solve the problem. the price ofthe option will then be computed using the obtained approximation of the earlyexercise boundary and a barycentric rational quadrature. the convergence of theapproximation scheme will also be analyzed. finally, some numerical experimentsbased on the introduced method are presented and compared to some exitingapproaches.
