in this paper we investigate light dual multinets labeled by a finite groupin the projective plane $pg(2,\mathbb{k})$ defined over a field $\mathbb{k}$.we present two classes of new examples. moreover, under some conditions on thecharacteristic $\mathbb{k}$, we classify group-labeled light dual multinetswith lines of length least $9$.
