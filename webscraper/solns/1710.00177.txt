in this work, we analyze the performance of full-duplex relay selection(fdrs) in spectrum-sharing networks. contrary to half-duplex relaying,full-duplex relaying (fdr) enables simultaneous listening/forwarding at thesecondary relay(s), thereby allowing for a higher spectral efficiency. however,since the source and relay simultaneously transmit in fdr, their superimposedsignal at the primary receiver should now satisfy the existing interferenceconstraint, which can considerably limit the secondary network throughput. inthis regard, relay selection can offer an adequate solution to boost thesecondary throughput while satisfying the imposed interference limit. we firstanalyze the performance of opportunistic fdrs with residual self-interference(rsi) by deriving the exact cumulative distribution function of its end-to-endsignal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio under nakagami-m fading. we alsoevaluate the offered diversity gain of relay selection for differentfull-duplex cooperation schemes in the presence/absence of a directsource-destination link. when the adopted rsi link gain model is sublinear inthe relay power, which agrees with recent research findings, we show thatremarkable diversity gain can be recovered even in the presence of aninterfering direct link. second, we evaluate the end-to-end performance of fdrswith interference constraints due to the presence of a primary receiver.finally, the presented exact theoretical findings are verified by numericalsimulations.
