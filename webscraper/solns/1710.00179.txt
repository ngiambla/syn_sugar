hyperuniformity is a feature of some processes where correlations suppressfluctuations. using a map to an interface picture we prove that a sequence ofavalanche sizes of the oslo model are hyperuniform on long macroscopictimescales $m\gg m^*$ and poisson-like on short timescales $m\ll m^*$, wherethe crossover point $m^*=l^{d(\tau-1)}$ is determined by the characteristicvertical fluctuations of the interfaces. our results imply that,counterintuitively, more precise estimates of the moments of the avalanche sizeare obtained if the samples are correlated rather than if the samples areindependent, implying a reduction of computing time for reliable estimates. wefurther show that when the driving site is chosen at random, the dominance ofthe drive noise over the interface noise prevents hyperuniformity. we supportour findings with numerical results.
