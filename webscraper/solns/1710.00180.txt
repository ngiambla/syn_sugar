d. bures defined a metric on states of a $c^*$-algebra as the infimum of thedistance between associated vectors in common gns representations. we take adifferent approach by looking at the completely bounded distance betweenrelevant joint representations. the notion has natural extension to unitalcompletely positive maps. this study yields new understanding of gnsrepresentations of states and in particular provides a new formula for buresmetric.
