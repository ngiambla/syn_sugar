we classify torsion actions of free wreath products of arbitrary compactquantum groups and use this to prove that if $\mathbb{g}$ is a torsion-freecompact quantum group satisfying the strong baum-connes property, then$\mathbb{g}\wr_{\ast}s_{n}^{+}$ also satisfies the strong baum-connes property.we then compute the k-theory of free wreath products of classical and quantumfree groups by $so_{q}(3)$.
