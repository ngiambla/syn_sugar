we prove full szeg\h{o}-type large-box trace asymptotics for selfadjoint$\mathbb{z}^d$-ergodic operators $\omega\ni \omega\mapsto h_\omega$ acting on$l^2(\mathbb{r}^d)$. more precisely, let $g$ be a bounded, compactly supportedand real-valued function such that the (averaged) operator kernel of$g(h_\omega)$ decays sufficiently fast, and let $h$ be a sufficiently smoothcompactly supported function. we then prove a full asymptotic expansion of theaveraged trace of the operator $h(g(h_\omega)_{[-l,l]^d})$ in terms of thelength-scale $l$.
