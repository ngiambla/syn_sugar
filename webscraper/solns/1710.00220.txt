we generalise the blok-j\'onsson account of structural consequence relations,later developed by galatos, tsinakis and other authors, in such a way as tonaturally accommodate multiset consequence. while blok and j\'onsson admit, inplace of sheer formulas, a wider range of syntactic units to be manipulated indeductions (including sequents or equations), these objects are invariablyaggregated via set-theoretical union. our approach is more general in thatnon-idempotent forms of premiss and conclusion aggregation, including multisetsum and fuzzy set union, are considered. in their abstract form, thus,deductive relations are defined as additional compatible preorderings overcertain partially ordered monoids. we investigate these relations usingcategorical methods, and provide analogues of the main results obtained in thegeneral theory of consequence relations. then we focus on the driving exampleof multiset deductive relations, providing variations of the methods of matrixsemantics and hilbert systems in abstract algebraic logic.
