inspired by the log gromov-witten theory of gross-siebert/abramovich-chen, weintroduce a geometric notion of log pseudoholomorphic map relative to simplenormal crossings symplectic divisors defined in [9]. for certain almost complexstructures, we show that the moduli space of stable log pseudoholomorphic mapsof any fixed type is compact and metrizable with respect to an enhancement ofthe gromov topology. in the case of smooth symplectic divisors, ourcompactification is often smaller than the relative compactification and thereis a projection map from the former onto the latter. the latter is constructedvia expanded degenerations of the target. our construction does not need anymodification of (or any extra structure on) the target. unlike the classicalmoduli spaces of stable maps, these log moduli spaces are often virtuallysingular. we describe an explicit toric model for the normal cone to eachstratum in terms of the defining combinatorial data of that stratum. inupcoming papers, we will define a natural fredholm operator which gives us thedeformation/obstruction spaces of each stratum and prove a gluing theorem forsmoothing log maps in the normal direction to each stratum. with minormodifications to the theory of kuranishi structures, the latter would allow usto construct a virtual fundamental class for every such log moduli space.
