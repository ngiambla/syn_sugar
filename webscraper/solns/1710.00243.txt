in his work on deformation quantization of algebraic varieties kontsevichintroduced the notion of algebroid as a certain generalization of a sheaf ofalgebras. we construct algebroids which are given locally by nc-smooththickenings in the sense of kapranov, over two classes of smooth varieties: thebases of miniversal families of vector bundles on projective curves, and thebases of miniversal families of quiver representations.
