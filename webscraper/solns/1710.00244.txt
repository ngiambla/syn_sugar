given a graph $g$, the (graph theory) general position problem is to find themaximum number of vertices such that no three vertices lie on a commongeodesic. this graph invariant is called the general position number (gp-numberfor short) of $g$ and denoted by ${\rm gp}(g)$. in this paper, the gp-number isdetermined for a large class of subgraphs of the infinite grid graph and forthe infinite diagonal grid. to derive these results, we introducemonotone-geodesic labeling and prove a monotone geodesic lemma that is in turndeveloped using the erd\"os-szekeres theorem on monotone sequences. thegp-number of the 3-dim infinite grid is bounded. using isometric path covers,the gp-number is also determined for bene\v{s} networks.
