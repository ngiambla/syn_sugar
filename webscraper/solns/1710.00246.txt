this paper aims to investigate the strong convergence analysis of theexponential euler method for parabolic stochastic partial differential equation(spde) driven by additive noise under more relaxed conditions. the spde isdiscretized in space by the finite element method. in contrast to veryrestrictive assumptions made in the literature on the drift term to achieveoptimal convergence orders with self-adjoint operator, we weaken thoseassumptions and assume only the standard lipschitz condition on the drift anddeal with not necessarily self-adjoint linear operator. under this relaxedassumption, we have achieved optimal convergence orders, which depend on theregularity of the noise and the initial data. in particular, for trace classnoise we achieve convergence orders of $\mathcal{o} (h^{2}+\delta t)$. theseoptimal convergence orders are due to a new optimal regularity result we havefurther derived here, which was not yet proved in the literature, even in thecase of self-adjoint operator. numerical experiments to illustrate ourtheoretical result are provided.
