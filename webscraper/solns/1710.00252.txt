we associate to a finite digraph $d$ a lattice polytope $p_d$ whose verticesare the rows of the laplacian matrix of $d$. this generalizes a constructionintroduced by braun and the third author. as a consequence of the matrix-treetheorem, we show that the normalized volume of $p_d$ equals the complexity of$d$, and $p_d$ contains the origin in its relative interior if and only if $d$is strongly connected. interesting connections with other families of simplicesare established and then used to describe reflexivity, $h^*$-polynomial, andinteger decomposition property of $p_d$ in these cases. we extend braun andmeyer's study of cycles by considering cycle digraphs. in this setting wecharacterize reflexivity and show there are only four non-trivial reflexivelaplacian simplices having the integer decomposition property.
