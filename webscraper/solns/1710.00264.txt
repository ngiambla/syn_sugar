we propose an efficient meta-algorithm for bayesian estimation problems thatis based on low-degree polynomials, semidefinite programming, and tensordecomposition. the algorithm is inspired by recent lower bound constructionsfor sum-of-squares and related to the method of moments. our focus is on samplecomplexity bounds that are as tight as possible (up to additive lower-orderterms) and often achieve statistical thresholds or conjectured computationalthresholds.  our algorithm recovers the best known bounds for community detection in thesparse stochastic block model, a widely-studied class of estimation problemsfor community detection in graphs. we obtain the first recovery guarantees forthe mixed-membership stochastic block model (airoldi et el.) in constantaverage degree graphs---up to what we conjecture to be the computationalthreshold for this model. we show that our algorithm exhibits a sharpcomputational threshold for the stochastic block model with multiplecommunities beyond the kesten--stigum bound---giving evidence that this taskmay require exponential time.  the basic strategy of our algorithm is strikingly simple: we compute thebest-possible low-degree approximation for the moments of the posteriordistribution of the parameters and use a robust tensor decomposition algorithmto recover the parameters from these approximate posterior moments.
