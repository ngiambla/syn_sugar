we consider both the minimisation of a class of nonlocal interaction energiesover non-negative measures with unit mass and a class of singular integralequations of the first kind of fredholm type. our setting covers applicationsto dislocation pile-ups, contact problems, fracture mechanics and 1d log gases.our main result shows that both the minimisation problems and the relatedsingular integral equations have the same unique solution, which provides newregularity results on the minimiser of the energy and new positivity results onthe solutions to singular integral equations.
