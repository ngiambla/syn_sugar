we introduce a new notion of angle between intermediate subfactors and provevarious interesting properties of the angle and relate it with the jones'index. we prove a uniform 60 to 90 degree bound for the angle between minimalintermediate subfactors of a finite index irreducible subfactor. from thisrigidity we can bound the number of minimal (or maximal) intermediatesubfactors by the kissing number in geometry. as a consequence, the numberintermediate subfactors of an irreducible subfactor has at most exponentialgrowth with respect to the jones index. this answers a question of longopublished in 2003.
