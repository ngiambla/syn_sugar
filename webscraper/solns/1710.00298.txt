in this paper we introduce and study the domination game on hypergraphs. thisis played on a hypergraph $\mathcal{h}$ by two players, namely dominator andstaller, who alternately select vertices such that each selected vertexenlarges the set of vertices dominated so far. the game is over if all verticesof $\mathcal{h}$ are dominated. dominator aims to finish the game as soon aspossible, while staller aims to delay the end of the game. if each player playsoptimally and dominator starts, the length of the game is the invariant `gamedomination number' denoted by $\gamma_g(\mathcal{h})$. this definition is thegeneralization of the domination game played on graphs and it is a special caseof the transversal game on hypergraphs. after some basic general results, weestablish an asymptotically tight upper bound on the game domination number of$k$-uniform hypergraphs. in the remaining part of the paper we prove that$\gamma_g(\mathcal{h}) \le 5n/9$ if $\mathcal{h}$ is a 3-uniform hypergraph oforder $n$ and does not contain isolated vertices. this also implies thefollowing new result for graphs: if $g$ is an isolate-free graph on $n$vertices and each of its edges is contained in a triangle, then $\gamma_g(g)\le 5n/9$.
