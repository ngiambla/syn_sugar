this paper presents a method to control the probability density distributionof a swarm of vehicles via velocity fields. the proposed approach synthesizessmooth velocity fields, which specify a desired velocity as a function of timeand position in a decentralized manner i.e., each agent calculates the desiredvelocity locally by utilizing the number of agents within a prescribedcommunication distance. swarm converges to the desired/commanded densitydistribution by following the velocity field. the local information consists,only, of agents' positions and it is utilized to estimate the density aroundeach agent. local density estimation is performed by using kernel densityestimation. then the local density estimates and the desired density areutilized to generate the velocity field, which propagates the swarm probabilitydensity distribution via the well-known heat equation. the key advantage ofusing smooth velocity fields to control swarm density with respect to ourearlier markov chain based probabilistic control methods is that the agentsmove more smoothly in an organized manner and their relative velocities go tozero as they get closer to each other, i.e., they facilitate conflict/collisionavoidance. the desired density distribution, which is commanded to the localcontrollers, can be computed by using a markov chain that propagates thedesired density distribution within prescribed requirements. along withconvergence and stability analysis, the effectiveness of the approach isillustrated via numerical examples.
