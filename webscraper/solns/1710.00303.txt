we prove that if $x \to y$ is a (geometrically) regular morphism ofnoetherian schemes, then from a nisnevich-local perspective, the gerstencomplex for quillen $k$-theory on $x$ becomes acyclic in degrees beyond thekrull dimension of $y$. using our methods, we also reduce the general gerstenconjecture for regular, unramified local rings to the case of a discretevaluation ring which is essentially smooth over $\mathbb{z}$. we apply ourresults to the the theory of algebraic cycles --- globally to obtain relativeversions of bloch's formula and locally to address the claborn-fossumconjecture concerning the vanishing of chow groups for regular local rings.
