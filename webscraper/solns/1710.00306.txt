a real form $g_0$ of a complex semisimple lie group $g$ has only finitelymany orbits in any given compact $g$-homogeneous projective algebraic manifold$z=g/q$. a maximal compact subgroup $k_0$ of $g_0$ has special orbits $c$ whichare complex sub-manifolds in the open orbits of $g_0$. these are referred to ascycles. the cycles intersect shubert varieties $s$ transversely in finitelymany points. in particular, determining these points of intersection yields adescription of the topological class of the given cycle. this was carried outfor all real forms of $sl(n,\mathbb{c})$ in the work of a. brecan. our workhere is devoted to the real forms of the other classical groups,$sp(2n,\mathbb{c})$ and $so(n,\mathbb{c})$. for the manifold $z=g/b$ ofcomplete flags the points of intersection in $s\cap c$ are described, inparticular the number of such is computed. for certain real forms, e.g.,$sp(2n,\mathbb{r})$ and $so^*(2n)$, remarkably simple formulas are proved. inother cases the results are algorithmic in nature.
