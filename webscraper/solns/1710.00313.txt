in this paper, we deal with the relation between the shadowing property andthe limit shadowing property. we prove that for any continuous self-map $f$ ofa compact metric space, if $f$ has the limit shadowing property, then therestriction of $f$ to the non-wandering set satisfies the shadowing property.as an application, we prove the equivalence of the two shadowing properties forequicontinuous maps.
