the monomorphism category $\mathscr{s}(a, m, b)$ induced by a bimodule$_am_b$ is the subcategory of $\lambda$-mod consisting of$\left[\begin{smallmatrix} x\\ y\end{smallmatrix}\right]_{\phi}$ such that$\phi: m\otimes_b y\rightarrow x$ is a monic $a$-map, where$\lambda=\left[\begin{smallmatrix} a&m\\0&b \end{smallmatrix}\right]$. ingeneral, it is not the monomorphism categories induced by quivers. it coulddescribe the gorenstein-projective $\m$-modules. this monomorphism category isa resolving subcategory of $\modcat{\lambda}$ if and only if $m_b$ isprojective. in this case, it has enough injective objects and auslander-reitensequences, and can be also described as the left perpendicular category of aunique basic cotilting $\lambda$-module. if $m$ satisfies the condition ${\rm(ip)}$, then the stable category of $\mathscr{s}(a, m, b)$ admits a recollementof additive categories, which is in fact a recollement of singularitycategories if $\mathscr{s}(a, m, b)$ is a {\rm frobenius} category.ringel-schmidmeier-simson equivalence between $\mathscr{s}(a, m, b)$ and itsdual is introduced. if $m$ is an exchangeable bimodule, then an {\rm rss}equivalence is given by a $\lambda$-$\lambda$ bimodule which is a two-sidedcotilting $\lambda$-module with a special property; and the nakayama functor$\mathcal n_\m$ gives an {\rm rss} equivalence if and only if both $a$ and $b$are frobenius algebras.
