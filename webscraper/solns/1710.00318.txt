we extend the theory of ground states of classical heisenberg spin systemspreviously published to the case where the interaction with an externalmagnetic field is described by a zeeman term. the ground state problem for theheisenberg-zeeman hamiltonian can be reduced first to the relative ground stateproblem, and, in a second step, to the absolute ground state problem for pureheisenberg hamiltonians depending on an additional lagrange parameter. wedistinguish between continuous and discontinuous reduction. moreover, there arevarious general statements about heisenberg-zeeman systems that will be provenunder most general assumptions. one topic is the connection between the minimalenergy functions $e_{min}$ for the heisenberg energy and $h_{min}$ for theheisenberg-zeeman energy which turn out to be essentially mutuallegendre-fenchel transforms. this generalization of the traditional legendretransform is especially suited to cope with situations where the function$e_{min}$ is not convex and consequently there is a magnetization jump at acritical field. another topic is magnetization and the occurrence of thresholdfields $b_{thr}$ and saturation fields $b_{sat}$, where we provide a generalformula for the latter. we suggest a distinction between ferromagnetic andanti-ferromagnetic systems based on the vanishing of $b_{sat}$ for the formerones. parabolic systems are defined in such a way that $e_{min}$ and $h_{min}$have a particularly simple form and studied in detail. for a large class ofparabolic systems the relative ground states can be constructed from theabsolute ground state by means of a so-called umbrella family. finally weprovide a counter-example of a parabolic system where this construction is notpossible.
