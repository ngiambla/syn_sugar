in this paper, we present fpt-algorithms for special cases of the shortestvector problem (svp) and the integer linear programming problem (ilp), whenmatrices included to the problems' formulations are near square. the mainparameter is the maximal absolute value of rank minors of matrices included tothe problem formulation. additionally, we present fpt-algorithms with respectto the same main parameter for the problems, when the matrices have no singularrank sub-matrices.
