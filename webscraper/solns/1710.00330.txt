for c*-algebras $a$ and $b$, we generalize the notion of a quasihomomorphismfrom $a$ to $b$, due to cuntz, by considering quasihomomorphisms from somec*-algebra $c$ to $b$ such that $c$ surjects onto $a$, and the two maps forminga quasihomomorphism agree on the kernel of this surjection. under an additionalassumption, the group of homotopy classes of such generalizedquasihomomorphisms coincides with $kk(a,b)$. this makes the definition ofkasparov's bifunctor slightly more symmetric and gives more flexibility forconstructing elements of $kk$-groups. these generalized quasihomomorphisms canbe viewed as pairs of maps directly from $a$ (instead of various $c$'s), butthese maps need not be $*$-homomorphisms.
