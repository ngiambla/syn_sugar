we consider the heat equation with a multiplicative gaussian potential indimensions $d\geq 3$. we show that the renormalized solution converges to thesolution of a deterministic diffusion equation with an effective diffusivity.we also prove that the renormalized large scale random fluctuations aredescribed by the edwards-wilkinson model, that is, the stochastic heat equation(she) with additive white noise, with an effective variance.
