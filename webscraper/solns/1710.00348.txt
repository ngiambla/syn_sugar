we study deviation probabilities for the number of high positioned particlesin branching brownian motion, and confirm a conjecture of derrida and shi(2016). we also solve the corresponding problem for the two-dimensionaldiscrete gaussian free field. our method relies on an elementary inequality forinhomogeneous galton-watson processes.
