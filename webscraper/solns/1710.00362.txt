we prove new upper bounds for the sup-norm of hecke maa{\ss} newforms on$gl(2)$ over a number field. our newforms are more general than thoseconsidered in a recent paper by blomer, harcos, maga, and mili\`cevi\`c: we donot require square free level. furthermore, we allow for non-trivial centralcharacter. over the rationals we cover the best bounds as obtained by saha.
