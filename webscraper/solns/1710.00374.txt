an $r$-matrix is a matrix with symbols in $\{0,1,\ldots,r-1\}$. a matrix issimple if it has no repeated columns. let ${\cal f}$ be a finite set of$r$-matrices. let $\hbox{forb}(m,r,{\cal f})$ denote the maximum number ofcolumns possible in a simple $r$-matrix  $a$ that has no submatrix which is a row and column permutation of any$f\in{\cal f}$. many investigations have involved $r=2$. for general $r$,$\hbox{forb}(m,r,{\cal f})$ is polynomial in $m$ if and only if for every pair$i,j\in\{0,1,\ldots,r-1\}$ there is a matrix in ${\cal f}$ whose entries areonly $i$ or $j$.  let ${\cal t}_{\ell}(r)$ denote the following $r$-matrices. for a pair$i,j\in\{0,1,\ldots,r-1\}$ we form four $\ell\times\ell$ matrices namely thematrix with $i$'s on the diagonal and $j$'s off the diagonal and the matrixwith $i$'s on and above the diagonal and $j$'s below the diagonal and the twomatrices with the roles of $i,j$ reversed. anstee and lu determined that$\hbox{forb}(m,r,{\cal t}_{\ell}(r))$ is a constant. let ${\cal f}$ be a finiteset of 2-matrices. we ask if $\hbox{forb}(m,r,{\cal t}_{\ell}(3)\backslash{\cal t}_{\ell}(2)\cup {\cal f})$ is $\theta(\hbox{forb}(m,2,{\cal f}))$ andsettle this in the affirmative for some cases including most 2-columned $f$.
