given the laplacian on a planar, convex domain with piecewise linear boundarysubject to mixed dirichlet-neumann boundary conditions, we provide a sufficientcondition for its lowest eigenvalue to dominate the lowest eigenvalue of thelaplacian with the complementary boundary conditions (i.e. with dirichletreplaced by neumann and vice versa). the application of this result totriangles gives an affirmative partial answer to a recent conjecture. moreover,we prove a further observation of similar flavor for right triangles.
