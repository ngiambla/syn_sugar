we define a generalization of the free lie algebra based on an $n$-arycommutator and call it the free lanke. we show that the action of the symmetricgroup $s_{2n-1}$ on the multilinear component with $2n-1$ generators is givenby the representation $s^{2^{n-1}1}$, whose dimension is the $n$th catalannumber. an application involving specht modules of staircase shape ispresented. we also introduce a conjecture that extends the relation between thewhitehouse representation and lie($k$).
