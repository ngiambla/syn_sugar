for a number of properties of c*-algebras, including real rank zero, stablerank one, pure infiniteness, residual hereditary infiniteness, the combinationof pure infiniteness and the ideal property, the property of being an atalgebra with real rank zero, and stability under tensoring with a stronglyselfabsorbing c*-algebra, we prove the following. consider an arbitrary actionof a second countable compact abelian group on a separable c*-algebra. then thefixed point algebra under the action has the given property if and only if thecrossed product has the same property.
