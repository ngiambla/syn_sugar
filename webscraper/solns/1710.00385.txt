we study a periodic, directed graph and the continuous time random walk$z(t)$ on the graph's nodes (assumed to be isolated points in $\mathbb{r}^d$),which jumps along the graph's edges with jump rates given by the edge weights.we do not assume that the edge weights are reversible. the main result is that,under certain conditions on the graph, the scaled process $\varepsilonz(t/\varepsilon^2)$ converges weakly in the skorokhod space to a brownianmotion. the diffusivity of the limiting brownian motion can be computed bysolving a set of linear algebra problems. an intuitive derivation via formalasymptotic expansion and a rigorous proof of convergence are provided. we showthat reversible rates, detailed balance, and certain symmetries of the graphare each alone sufficient for the convergence. for the case of reversible jumprates, an equivalent variational formulation is derived. this derivationinvolves developing notions of gradient for functions on the graph's nodes,divergence for $\mathbb{r}^d$-valued functions on the graph's edges, and adivergence theorem. this work is partially motivated by the modeling of aparticle's random motion in an obstructed environment where the particle mayinteract with the obstructions.
