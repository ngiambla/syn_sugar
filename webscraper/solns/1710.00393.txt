we develop a dynamical version of some of the theory surrounding thetoms-winter conjecture for simple separable nuclear c*-algebras and study itsconnections to the c*-algebra side via the crossed product. we introduce ananalogue of hyperfiniteness for free actions of amenable groups on compactspaces and show that it plays the role of z-stability in the toms-winterconjecture in its relation to dynamical comparison, and also that it impliesz-stability of the crossed product. this property, which we call almostfiniteness, generalizes matui's notion of the same name from thezero-dimensional setting. we also introduce a notion of tower dimension aspartial analogue of nuclear dimension and study its relation to dynamicalcomparison and almost finiteness, as well as to the dynamical asymptoticdimension and amenability dimension of guentner, willett, and yu.
