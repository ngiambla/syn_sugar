cell-free (cf) massive mimo is an alternative topology for massive mimonetworks, where a large number of single-antenna access points (aps) aredistributed over the coverage area. there are no cells but all users arejointly served by the aps using network mimo methods. in prior work, it hasbeen claimed that cf massive mimo inherits the basic properties of cellularmassive mimo, namely channel hardening and favorable propagation. in thispaper, we evaluate if one can rely on these properties when having a realisticstochastic ap deployment. our results show that the level of channel hardeningdepends strongly on the propagation environment and there is generally littlehardening, except when the pathloss exponent is small. we further show thatusing 5--10 antennas per ap, instead of one, we can greatly improve thehardening. the level of favorable propagation is affected by the propagationenvironment and by the distance between the users, where only spatially wellseparated users exhibit favorable propagation. the conclusion is that we cannotrely on channel hardening and favorable propagation when analyzing anddesigning cf massive mimo networks, but we need to use achievable rateexpressions and resource allocation schemes that work well in the absence ofthese properties. some options are described in this paper.
