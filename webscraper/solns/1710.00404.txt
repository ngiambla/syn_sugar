we obtain general results on the dynamics of exactly conical geometries,where we use the notion of boundaries at infinity to characterize asymptoticbehavior. as we demonstrate in examples, these notions also apply to smoothgeometries that are merely asymptotically conical, such as the eguchi-hanson orresolved conifold geometries. in these cases we obtain a rather completequalitative understanding of the varieties of asymptotic behavior, and we probethe connectivity of the phase space by finding infinitely large families ofmultiple geodesics connecting a point on the infinite past boundary with apoint in the infinite future boundary.
