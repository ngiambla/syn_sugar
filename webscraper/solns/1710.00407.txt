a rational map $\phi: \mathbb{p}_k^m \dashrightarrow \mathbb{p}_k^n$ isdefined by homogeneous polynomials of a common degree $d$. we establish alinear bound in terms of $d$ for the number of $(m-1)$-dimensional fibers of$\phi$, by using ideals of minors of the jacobian matrix. in particular, weanswer affirmatively question~11 in arxiv:1511.02933v2.
