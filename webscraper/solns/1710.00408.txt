local fourier analysis (lfa) is a useful tool in predicting the convergencefactors of geometric multigrid methods (gmg). as is well known, on rectangulardomains with periodic boundary conditions this analysis gives the exactconvergence factors of such methods. in this work, using the fourier method, weextend these results by proving that such analysis yields the exact convergencefactors for a wider class of problems.
