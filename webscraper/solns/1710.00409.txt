in this paper we build an orlik-solomon model for the canonical gradation ofthe cohomology algebra with integer coefficients of the complement of a toricarrangement. we give some results on the uniqueness of the representation ofarithmetic matroids, in order to discuss how the orlik-solomon model depends onthe poset of layers. the analysis of discriminantal toric arrangements permitsus to isolate certain conditions under which two toric arrangements havediffeomorphic complements. we also give combinatorial conditions determiningwhether the cohomology algebra is generated in degree one.
