redundancy for straggler mitigation, originally in data download and morerecently in distributed computing context, has been shown to be effective bothin theory and practice. analysis of systems with redundancy has drawnsignificant attention and numerous papers have studied pain and gain ofredundancy under various service models and assumptions on the stragglercharacteristics. we here present a cost (pain) vs. latency (gain) analysis ofusing simple replication or erasure coding for straggler mitigation inexecuting jobs with many tasks. we quantify the effect of the tail of taskexecution times and discuss tail heaviness as a decisive parameter for the costand latency of using redundancy. specifically, we find that coded redundancyachieves better cost vs. latency tradeoff than simple replication and can yieldreduction in both cost and latency under less heavy tailed execution times. weshow that delaying redundancy is not effective in reducing cost and thatdelayed relaunch of stragglers can yield significant reduction in cost andlatency. we validate these observations by comparing with the simulations thatuse empirical distributions extracted from google cluster data.
