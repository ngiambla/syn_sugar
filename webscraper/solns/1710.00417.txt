a new second-order method for approximating the compressible euler equationsis introduced. the method preserves all the known invariant domains of theeuler system: positivity of the density, positivity of the internal energy andthe local minimum principle on the specific entropy. the technique combines afirst-order, invariant domain preserving, guaranteed maximum speed method usinga graph viscosity (gms-gv1) with an invariant domain violating, but entropyconsistent, high-order method. invariant domain preserving auxiliary states,naturally produced by the gms-gv1 method, are used to define local bounds forthe high-order method which is then made invariant domain preserving via aconvex limiting process. numerical tests confirm the second-order accuracy ofthe new gms-gv2 method in the maximum norm, where 2 stands for second-order.the proposed convex limiting is generic and can be applied to otherapproximation techniques and other hyperbolic systems.
