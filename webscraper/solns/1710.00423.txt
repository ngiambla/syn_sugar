we investigate necessary as well as sufficient conditions under which thelaurent series coefficients $f_{\boldsymbol{n}}$ associated to a multivariaterational function satisfy gauss congruences, that is $f_{\boldsymbol{m}p^r}\equiv f_{\boldsymbol{m}p^{r-1}}$ modulo $p^r$. for instance, we show thatthese congruences hold for certain determinants of logarithmic derivatives. asan application, we completely classify rational functions $p/q$ satisfying thegauss congruences in the case that $q$ is linear in each variable.
