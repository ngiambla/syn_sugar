we define a right cartan-eilenberg structure on the category of kan'scombinatorial spectra, and the category of sheaves of such spectra, assumingsome conditions. in both structures, we use the geometric concept of homotopyequivalence as the strong equivalence. in the case of sheaves, we use localequivalence as the weak equivalence. this paper is the first step in alarger-scale program of investigating sheaves of spectra from a geometricviewpoint.
