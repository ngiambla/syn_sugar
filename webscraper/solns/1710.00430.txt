in this paper we give an upper bound for the number of integral points on anelliptic curve e over f_q[t] in terms of its conductor n and q. we proceed byapplying the lower bounds for the canonical height that are analogous to thosegiven by silverman and extend the technique developed by helfgott-venkatesh toexpress the number of integral points on e in terms of its algebraic rank. wealso use the sphere packing results to optimize the size of an impliedconstant. in the end we use partial birch swinnerton-dyer conjecture that isknown to be true over function fields to bound the algebraic rank by theanalytic one and apply the explicit formula for the analytic rank of e.
