we identify a strong stability condition on minimal submanifolds that impliesuniqueness and dynamical stability properties. in particular, we prove auniqueness theorem and a c^1 dynamical stability theorem of the mean curvatureflow for minimal submanifolds that satisfy this condition. the latter theoremstates that the mean curvature flow of any other submanifold in a c^1neighborhood of such a minimal submanifold exists for all time, and convergesexponentially to the minimal one. this extends our previous uniqueness andstability theorem [arxiv:1605.03645] which applies only to calibratedsubmanifolds of special holonomy ambient manifolds.
