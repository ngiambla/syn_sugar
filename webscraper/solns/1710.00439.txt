it is shown that a flat subgroup, $h$, of the totally disconnected, locallycompact group $g$ decomposes into a finite number of subsemigroups on which thescale function is multiplicative. the image, $p$, of a multiplicative semigroupin the quotient, $h/h(1)$, of $h$ by its uniscalar subgroup has a uniqueminimal generating set which determines a natural cayley graph structure on$p$. for each compact, open subgroup $u$ of $g$, a graph is defined and it isshown that if $p$ is multiplicative over $u$ then this graph is a regular,rooted, strongly simple $p$-graph. this extends to higher rank the result of r.m\"oller that $u$ is tidy for $x$ if and only if a certain graph is a regular,rooted tree.
