let $h$ be a norm of ${\bf r}^n$ and $h_0$ the dual norm of $h$. denote by$\delta_h$ the finsler-laplace operator defined by$\delta_hu:=\mbox{div}\,(h(\nabla u)\nabla_\xi h(\nabla u))$. in this paper weprove that the finsler-laplace operator $\delta_h$ acts as a linear operator to$h_0$-radially symmetric smooth functions. furthermore, we obtain an optimalsufficient condition for the existence of the solution to the cauchy problemfor the finsler heat equation $$ \partial_t u=\delta_h u,\qquad x\in{\bfr}^n,\quad t>0, $$ where $n\ge 1$ and $\partial_t:=\partial/\partial t$.
