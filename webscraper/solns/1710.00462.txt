in this article, we study certain local cohomology modules over $f$-purerings. we give sufficient conditions for the vanishing of some lyubezniknumbers, derive a formula for computing these invariants when the $f$-pure ringis standard graded and, by its means, we provide some new examples of lyubezniktables. we study associated primes of certain ext-modules, showing that theyare all compatible ideals. finally, we focus on properties that lyubezniknumbers detect over a globally $f$-split projective variety.
