the theory of anyon systems, as modular functors topologically and unitarymodular tensor categories algebraically, is mature. to go beyond anyons, ourfirst step is the interplay of anyons with conventional group symmetry due tothe paramount importance of group symmetry in physics. this led to the theoryof symmetry-enriched topological order. another direction is the boundaryphysics of topological phases, both gapless as in the fractional quantum hallphysics and gapped as in toric code. a more speculative and interestingdirection is the study of banados-teitelboim-zanelli black holes and quantumgravity in $3d$. the clearly defined physical and mathematical issues require afar-reaching generalization of anyons and seem to be within reach. in thisshort survey, i will first cover the extensions of anyon theory to symmetrydefects and gapped boundaries. then i will discuss a desired generalization ofanyons to anyon-like objects---the banados-teitelboim-zanelli black holes---in$3d$ quantum gravity.
