in this paper the long time behavior of the micropolar fluid equations energyon three dimensional space are studied. we show that $ \| (u,w)(\cdot,t)\|_{{l^{2}(\mathbb{r}^{3})}} \to 0 $ as $t \to \infty$ for leray-hopf's globalweak solutions in inviscid vortex case. moreover, when the vortex viscosity areconsidered, i.e., $\chi >0$, we obtain a (faster) decay for micro-rotationalfield: $ \| w (\cdot,t) \|_{{l^{2}(\mathbb{r}^{3})}} = o(t^{-1/2})$.
