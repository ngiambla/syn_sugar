pseudo-differential operators of type $(1,1)$ and order $m$ are continuousfrom $f_p^{s+m,q}$ to $f_p^{s,q}$ if $s>\max{(0,d({1}/{p}-1),d({1}/{q}-1))}$for $0<p<\infty$, and from $b_p^{s+m,q}$ to $b_{p}^{s,q}$ if$s>\max{(0,d({1}/{p}-1))}$ for $0<p\leq\infty$. in this work we prove thesharpness of the conditions on $s$, and extend the $f$-boundedness result to$p=\infty$. we also prove that the operators map $f_{\infty}^{m,1}$ into $bmo$when $s=0$. the boundedness of the operators also hold for arbitrary $s$ withh\"ormander's condition on the twisted diagonal.
