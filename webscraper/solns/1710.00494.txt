in this paper we show that the eigenvalue map and the symplectic eigenvaluemap of positive definite matrices are lipschitz for the cartan-hadamardriemannian metric, and establish log-majorizations for the (symplectic)eigenvalues of the cartan barycenter of integrable probability borel measures.this leads a version of jensen's inequality for geometric integrals ofmatrix-valued integrable random variables.
