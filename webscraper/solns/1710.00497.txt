we introduce a new geometric invariant called the obtuse constant of spaceswith curvature bounded below, defined in terms of comparison angles. we firstfind relations between this invariant and volume. we discuss the case ofmaximal obtuse constant equal to $\pi/2$, where we prove some rigidity forspaces. although we consider alexandrov spaces with curvature bounded below,the results are new even in the riemannian case.
