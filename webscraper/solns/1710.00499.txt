in the online multiple testing problem, p-values corresponding to differentnull hypotheses are observed one by one, and the decision of whether or not toreject the current hypothesis must be made immediately, after which the nextp-value is observed. alpha-investing algorithms to control the false discoveryrate (fdr), formulated by foster and stine, have been generalized and appliedto many settings, including quality-preserving databases in science andmultiple a/b or multi-armed bandit tests for internet commerce. this paperimproves the class of generalized alpha-investing algorithms (gai) in fourways: (a) we show how to uniformly improve the power of the entire class ofmonotone gai procedures by awarding more alpha-wealth for each rejection,giving a win-win resolution to a recent dilemma raised by javanmard andmontanari, (b) we demonstrate how to incorporate prior weights to indicatedomain knowledge of which hypotheses are likely to be non-null, (c) we allowfor differing penalties for false discoveries to indicate that some hypothesesmay be more important than others, (d) we define a new quantity called thedecaying memory false discovery rate (mem-fdr) that may be more meaningful fortruly temporal applications, and which alleviates problems that we describe andrefer to as "piggybacking" and "alpha-death". our gai++ algorithms incorporateall four generalizations simultaneously, and reduce to more powerful variantsof earlier algorithms when the weights and decay are all set to unity. finally,we also describe a simple method to derive new online fdr rules based on anestimated false discovery proportion.
