the aim of this paper, is to define a bivariate exponentiated generalizedlinear exponential distribution based on marshall-olkin shock model.statistical and reliability properties of this distribution are discussed. thisincludes quantiles, moments, stress-strength reliability, joint reliabilityfunction, joint reversed (hazard) rates functions and joint mean waiting timefunction. moreover, the hazard rate, the availability and the mean residuallifetime functions for a parallel system, are established. one data set isanalyzed, and it is observed that, the proposed distribution provides a betterfit than marshall-olkin bivariate exponential, bivariate generalizedexponential and bivariate generalized linear failure rate distributions.simulation studies are presented to estimate both the relative absolute bias,and the relative mean square error for the distribution parameters based oncomplete data.
