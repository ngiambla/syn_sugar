we study the convexity preserving property for a class of time-dependenthamilton-jacobi equations in a complete geodesic space. assuming that thehamiltonian is nondecreasing, we show that in a busemann space the uniquemetric viscosity solution preserves the geodesic convexity of the initial valueat any time. we provide two approaches and also discuss several generalizationsfor more general geodesic spaces including the lattice graph.
