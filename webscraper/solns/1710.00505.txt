let $\{g_m\}_{m\geq 0}$ be the random graph process, where $g_0$ is the emptygraph on $n$ vertices and subsequent graphs in the sequence are obtained byadding a new edge uniformly at random. for each $\varepsilon>0$, we show that,almost surely, any graph $g_m$ with minimum degree at least 2 is not onlyhamiltonian (as shown by bollob\'as), but remains hamiltonian despite theremoval of any set of edges, as long as at most $(1/2-\varepsilon)$ of theedges incident to each vertex are removed. we say that such a graph is$(1/2-\varepsilon)$-resiliently hamiltonian. furthermore, for each$\epsilon>0$, we show that, almost surely, each graph $g_m$ is not$(1/2+\varepsilon)$-resiliently hamiltonian. these results strengthen those bylee and sudakov on the likely resilience of hamiltonicity in the binomialrandom graph.  for each $k$, we denote by $g^{(k)}$ the (possibly empty) maximal subgraphwith minimum degree at least $k$ of a graph $g$. that is, the $k$-core of $g$.krivelevich, lubetzky and sudakov have shown that, for each $k\geq 15$, inalmost every random graph process $\{g_m\}_{m\geq 0}$, every non-empty $k$-coreis hamiltonian. we show that, for each $\varepsilon>0$ and $k\geqk_0(\varepsilon)$, in almost every random graph process $\{g_m\}_{m\geq 0}$,every non-empty $k$-core is $(1/2-\varepsilon)$-resiliently hamiltonian, butnot $(1/2+\varepsilon)$-resiliently hamiltonian.
