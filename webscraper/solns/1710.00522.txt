for the spatial generalized $n$-centre problem $$ \ddot{x} = -\sum_{i=1}^{n}\frac{m_i (x - c_i)}{\vert x - c_i \vert^{\alpha+2}},\qquad x \in \mathbb{r}^3\setminus \{c_1,\dots,c_n \}, $$ where $m_i > 0$ and $\alpha \in [1,2)$, weprove the existence of positive energy entire solutions with prescribedscattering angle. the proof relies on variational arguments, within anapproximation procedure via (free-time) boundary value problems. aself-contained appendix describing a general strategy to rule out theoccurrence of collisions is also included.
