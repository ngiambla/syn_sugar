this paper is devoted to the study of periodic solutions for a radiallysymmetric semilinear wave equation in an $n$-dimensional ball. by combining thevariational methods and saddle point reduction technique, we prove there existat least three periodic solutions for arbitrary space dimension $n$. thestructure of the spectrum of the linearized problem plays an essential role inthe proof, and the construction of a suitable working space is devised toovercome the restriction of space dimension.
