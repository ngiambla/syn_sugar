the discontinuous petrov-galerkin method is a minimal residual method withbroken test spaces and is introduced for a nonlinear model problem in thispaper. its lowest-order version applies to a nonlinear uniformly convex modelexample and is equivalently characterized as a mixed formulation, a reducedformulation, and a weighted nonlinear least-squares method. quasi-optimal apriori and reliable and efficient a posteriori estimates are obtained for theabstract nonlinear dpg framework for the approximation of a regular solution.the variational model example allows for a built-in guaranteed error controldespite inexact solve. the subtle uniqueness of discrete minimizers ismonitored in numerical examples.
