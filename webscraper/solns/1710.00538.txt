we study the chandrasekhar variational model for the neutron stars, with orwithout an external potential. we prove the existence of minimizers when theattractive interaction strength $\tau$ is strictly smaller than a criticalvalue $\tau_c$, and investigate the blow-up phenomenon in the limit$\tau\nearrow \tau_{c}$.
