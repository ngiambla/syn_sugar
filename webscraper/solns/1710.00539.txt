in this paper we are concerned with the approach to shape analysis based onthe so called square root velocity transform (srvt). we propose ageneralisation of the srvt from euclidean spaces to shape spaces of curves onlie groups and on homogeneous manifolds. the main idea behind our approach isto exploit the geometry of the natural lie group actions on these spaces.
