Abstract

Background: The epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a molecular process through which an epithelial
cell undergoes transdifferentiation into a mesenchymal phenotype. The role of EMT in embryogenesis is well-
characterized and increasing evidence suggests that elements of the transition may be important in other
processes, including metastasis and drug resistance in various different cancers.
Methods: Agilent 4  44 K whole human genome arrays and selected reaction monitoring mass spectrometry
were used to investigate mRNA and protein expression in A2780 cisplatin sensitive and resistant cell lines. Invasion
and migration were assessed using Boyden chamber assays. Gene knockdown of snail and slug was done using
targeted siRNA. Clinical relevance of the EMT pathway was assessed in a cohort of primary ovarian tumours using
data from Affymetrix GeneChip Human Genome U133 plus 2.0 arrays.
Results: Morphological and phenotypic hallmarks of EMT were identified in the chemoresistant cells. Subsequent
gene expression profiling revealed upregulation of EMT-related transcription factors including snail, slug, twist2 and
zeb2. Proteomic analysis demonstrated up regulation of Snail and Slug as well as the mesenchymal marker
Vimentin, and down regulation of E-cadherin, an epithelial marker. By reducing expression of snail and slug, the
mesenchymal phenotype was largely reversed and cells were resensitized to cisplatin. Finally, gene expression data
from primary tumours mirrored the finding that an EMT-like pathway is activated in resistant tumours relative to
sensitive tumours, suggesting that the involvement of this transition may not be limited to in vitro drug effects.
Conclusions: This work strongly suggests that genes associated with EMT may play a significant role in cisplatin
resistance in ovarian cancer, therefore potentially leading to the development of predictive biomarkers of drug
response or novel therapeutic strategies for overcoming drug resistance.

Background
Of the gynecological malignancies, ovarian cancer has
the highest associated mortality rate in the western
world [1,2]. While relatively rare at 1 in 71 women
affected in Canada [3], approximately 70-80% of patients
with ovarian cancer will succumb to the disease within
five years of diagnosis [4]. The high mortality rate is
due, in part, to the fact that ovarian cancer is often

diagnosed in advanced stage, because of a lack of mea-
surable early symptoms and ineffective screening techni-
ques [5,6]. Of equal importance, 20% of tumours display
primary resistance to platinum compounds while the
majority of initial responders will relapse, often as a
result of acquired drug resistance [7,8].

Standard treatment

for ovarian cancer involves
tumour debulking and platinum-based chemotherapy
administered intravenously or intraperitoneally [9,10].
Cisplatin, the most common first line chemotherapeutic
drug, is a platinum compound that binds to and cross-
links DNA [11]. During cell division cisplatin-DNA

adducts block replicative machinery, inducing the DNA
damage response, and eventually apoptosis [11,12]. It
has been proposed that decreased cellular uptake of
drug as well as increased capacity for DNA damage
repair and anti-apoptotic signaling may play a role in
cisplatin resistance displayed by many tumours [12-17].

Recent evidence has suggested that processes of the
epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) may play a
role in the development of chemoresistance. EMT is a
critical process in embryogenesis [18] and has been well
studied in that context. It is characterized by up-regula-
tion of extracellular matrix components, a loss of inter-
cellular cohesion, increased rate of cellular migration
and invasion, as well as increased resistance to apopto-
sis, and is modulated by a number of transcription fac-
tors, namely SNAI1 (Snail) and SNAI2 (Slug) [19,20]. In
early embryogenesis, these cellular traits enable both the
formation of the germinal layers during gastrulation by
facilitating formation of the mesoderm and endoderm
from cells in the primitive streak, and derivation of
migratory neural crest cells from the epithelial neural
plate [21]. EMT also has a significant role later in
embryo development during tissue reorganization and
organ modeling [22,23]. The same cellular remodeling
and signaling networks appear to be active during
metastasis, and may also contribute to the development
of drug resistance in tumour cells [24-26]. During can-
cer progression, EMT appears to promote dissemination
of cells from the tumour mass [27] and facilitates tissue
invasion by regulating the production of matrix metallo-
proteases and altering cytoskeletal organization [28,29].
In models of drug resistant breast and ovarian cancers,
EMT gene signatures have been found to correlate with
the presence of drug resistance [30,31] and manipulation
of EMT transcriptional regulators modulates resistance
to chemotherapeutic drugs in lung and bladder cancers
[32,33]. Additional evidence suggests that EMT may
contribute to the acquisition of drug resistance by alter-
ing expression of key genes involved in cell cycle regula-
tion, drug transport and apoptosis [34-36].

We hypothesized that the genes that regulate EMT
have a role in cisplatin resistance in ovarian cancer.
Using a cell line model of cisplatin-resistant ovarian
cancer, we demonstrate features of a mesenchymal phe-
notype in the resistant cells relative to their epithelial
parent cells. Additionally, we demonstrate increased
capacity for migration and invasion in resistant com-
pared to sensitive cells, characteristics that are reverted
following reduction of expression of snail and slug.
Using a cohort of primary human ovarian tumours, we
demonstrate that EMT genes are upregulated in chemo-
nave drug resistant tumours, suggesting that these
genes may act as biomarkers of chemotherapy resis-
tance. Finally, we modulate resistance to cisplatin in

A2780cis cells by manipulating levels of snail and slug,
suggesting that the key regulators of EMT are directly
contributing to the drug resistant phenotype in ovarian
cancer cells.

Methods
Cell lines and culture conditions
The cisplatin-sensitive A2780 ovarian adenocarcinoma
cell line and its daughter line, A2780cis, were obtained
from the European Collection of Cell Cultures (Salis-
bury, UK). Cells were cultured in RPMI with 10%FBS,
1% penicillin/streptomycin and 1% L-glutamine at 37C
in 5% CO2. A2780cis cells were maintained in media
with 1 M cisplatin. For all assays, cells were grown to
70-80% confluence and harvested following trypsiniza-
tion. Analysis of cell morphology was done at 20 mag-
nification using a Zeiss Axiovert 25 Phase Contrast
Inverted Microscope. Digital images were captured
using a Canon Power Shot G10 equipped with a Carl
Zeiss 426126 lens.

Human ovarian tumours
Consent for tumour banking was obtained and the study
was approved by the Research Ethics Boards at both
Kingston General Hospital and The Ottawa Hospital.
Tumour samples were obtained from the Division of
Gynecologic Oncology Ovarian Tissue Bank and the
Ontario Tumour Bank. All tumours were chemonave at
collection. Seventeen tumours were classified as chemo-
sensitive (progression-free interval of greater than 18
months) and eleven as chemoresistant (progression-free
interval of less than 8 months) using available follow-up
clinical data. Histological assessment of samples con-
firmed that each sample contained > 70% tumour cells.

Gene expression profiling and analysis
Total RNA was extracted from the cell
lines and
tumours using the Qiagen miRNeasy Mini kit (Tor-
onto, Canada). RNA quality was assessed to have an
RNA integrity number of at least eight using an Agi-
lent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Mississauga, Canada). For cell
lines, total RNA was labeled with Cyanine-3 dye using
a Quick Amp Labeling Kit (Agilent, Mississauga,
Canada) and hybridized to Agilent Whole Human
Genome (4  44 K) Microarrays (Mississauga, Canada)
for 17 hours in a rotating SciGene model 700 oven
(Sunnyvale, USA). Arrays were scanned using an Agi-
lent Technologies DNA Microarray Scanner and data
were feature extracted using Feature Extraction Soft-
ware 10.5.1.1 (Agilent) and statistically analyzed using
default settings on GeneSpring GX 11.0.1 software
(Agilent).

Expression profiles from the tumor RNA were
obtained using Affymetrix GeneChip Human Genome

U133 plus 2.0 arrays. Raw data were imported into
GeneSpring GX 11.0.1 and analyzed. Unsupervised hier-
archical clustering of the tumour samples was com-
pleted using the self-organizing maps algorithm in the
GeneSpring GX 11.0.1 package.

qRT-PCR Taqman arrays
Snail and Slug expression levels were analyzed using Taq-
man assays (Applied Biosystems, Streetsville, Canada,
item Hs00195591_m1 and item Hs00950344_m1) and the
SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis SuperMix kit for
qRT-PCR (Invitrogen, Burlington, Canada). PCR condi-
tions were 50C for 2 minutes, 95C for 10 minutes, 40
cycles of 95C for 15 seconds, 60C for 1 minute. GAPDH
was used as an internal control. As a measure of relative
change in expression between the parental and resistant
samples, Ct values were calculated and converted to
approximate fold change values (2-Ct) [37].

Cell proliferation assay
Cells were plated in 24-well plates at 5  104 cells/well.
Cells were harvested and counted using a haemocyt-
ometer after 24, 48 and 72 hours. Average cell counts
were used to produce growth curves, from which cell
doubling time was calculated.

Wound healing assay
Cell migration was assessed using wound-healing assays.
Cells were grown in a confluent monolayer in a 60 mm
plate. A wound was inflicted in the cell layer by scratch-
ing the plate with a sterile pipette tip. Plates were rinsed
gently with media twice prior to incubation to remove
non-adherent cells. Digital images of the wound were
obtained at times 0 hours, 12 hours and 36 hours at
10 magnification. Effects of proliferation were con-
trolled for by using a reduced serum medium (3%FBS)
and monitored via cell count.

Boyden chamber migration and invasion assays
Cells were serum starved for 24 hours prior to use.
Media with 10% FBS was added to the wells of a 24-
well plate. BD Falcon Cell Culture Inserts (BD Bios-
ciences, Mississauga, Canada) were placed in each
well. 2  103 cells in serum-free media were added to
the interior of each insert. Plates were incubated for
24 hours at 37C in 5% CO2, and media removed
from the insert, which was then washed with PBS.
Insert membranes were fixed with cold methanol for
10 minutes, stained with 0.5% Crystal Violet in 25%
methanol
for 10 mins and rinsed with water to
remove excess dye. Membranes were removed from
the insert, placed under a microscope and the number
of cells that migrated through the porous membrane
was counted.

Invasion assays were done as described above using
BD BioCoat Matrigel invasion chambers (BD Bios-
ciences, Mississauga, Canada).

MTT assays
5  103 cells/well were seeded in 96-well plates in 100
ul medium with 10 M cisplatin and without phenol
red and left to incubate for 48 hours at 37C and 5%
CO2 . After 48 hours, 10 l MTT (3-(4,5-Dimethylthia-
zol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) (Sigma-
Aldrich, Oakville, Canada) was added to each well and
cells were left for 4 hours. After incubation, 150 l
MTT solvent (0.1 N HCl in anhydrous isopropanol) was
added to each well and mixed thoroughly by pipetting
until all formazan crystals were dissolved. Colourimetric
change was measured at 570 nm and background absor-
bance at 690 nm. Final values were obtained by sub-
tracting OD690 nm from OD570 nm. MTT assays for
siRNA optimization were done without adding cisplatin
and the initial seeded cells were only incubated for 24
hours prior to MTT addition.

5GCAUUUGCAGACAGGUCAA and
sequences:
5UUGACCUGUCUGCAAAUGC) were purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich (Oakville, Canada).

Optimization of gene knockdown was done using All-
Stars Hs Cell Death Control siRNA (Qiagen, Toronto,
Canada), a mix of siRNAs that target genes essential for
cell survival. 5  104 cells/well were plated in 24-well
plates and incubated overnight. After 24 hours cells
were transfected with 7.5 ng, 19 ng, 37.5 ng or 75 ng of
AllStars Hs Cell Death Control siRNA and 1.5 l, 3 l
or 7.5 l of HiPerFect Transfection Reagent (Qiagen,
Toronto, Canada). Cells were incubated for 72 hours
and cell death measured using MTT assays. Maximum
cell death was achieved using 19 ng siRNA with 3 l of
transfection reagent. Optimal time points were then
established using siRNA targeted against Snail and Slug.
24, 48 and 72 hours after transfection the level of snail
and slug transcript was determined by qRT-PCR Taq-
Man assay. Optimal knockdown of both genes was seen
72 hours post transfection. Efficiency of transfection in
the A2780 and A2780cis cells was determined to be 87%
and 84%, respectively.

For knockdown experiments, 5  104 cells/well were
plated in 24-well plates and incubated overnight. 19 ng
of siRNA and 3 l of HiPerFect transfection reagent
were diluted in 100 l serum-free RPMI and were incu-
bated for 10 minutes at room temperature. Transfection

complexes were then added drop-wise onto the cells.
Cells were incubated for 72 hours at 37C and 5% CO2.
Media was changed as necessary. Transfection of
A2780cis cells with AllStars Negative Control (Qiagen),
an siRNA sequence with no homology to any known
mammalian gene, was used as a control for this experi-
ment. Cells with reduced expression were designated as
follows: A2780cisSN - snail knockdown, A2780cisSL -
slug knockdown, A2780cisSN/SL - both snail and slug
knocked down.

Statistical analysis
Each assay was performed in triplicate. Data are
expressed as the mean  standard deviation (SD). Statis-
tical significance of all data was evaluated using the Stu-
dents t-test, p < 0.05.

Sample preparation for proteomic analysis
Samples were lysed in RIPA buffer containing Halt Pro-
tease and Phosphatase Inhibitor Cocktail (PIERCE, IL,
USA). Cells were sonicated and lysates incubated at 4C
for 30 minutes with shaking. Supernatants were sepa-
rated by centrifugation for 15 minutes at 4C. Protein
concentration was measured with a Bio-Rad DC Protein
Assay kit and 30 g of protein was used for tryptic
digestion. Each aliquot was dried, dissolved in 0.5 M
triethylammonium bicarbonate (TEAB), reduced by add-
ing 2 l of tris-(2-carboxyethyl)-phosphine (TCEP),
incubated at room temperature for 1 hour, alykalted
using 1 l of methyl methane thiosulfonate (MMTS)
and incubated at room temperature for 1 hour in the
dark. 2 g trypsin was added for overnight digestion at
37C. The tryptic digest was desalted by using a C18
spin column (PIERCE, USA), dried under vaccum and
resuspended in 0.1% formic acid for SRM analysis.

LC/SRM-MS analysis
The LC/SRM-MS analytical system consisted of an Eksi-
gent nanoflow HPLC (AB Sciex, USA) coupled to a
5500 QTRAP hybrid triple quadrupole/linear ion trap
mass spectrometer (AB SCIEX, USA). 1 g of digested
protein was loaded onto a trap column (0.3 mm I.D, 5
mm L), packed with 5 m Zorbax SB-C18, 300  pore
(Agilent, USA). Peptides were separated on a 75 m I.
D., 15 cm long nanoflow column with 15 m spray tip
(New Objectives, USA). A linear gradient profile was
employed starting from 5% solvent B to 40% B in 60
minutes (solvent A was 2% acetonitrile in water with
0.1% formic acid; solvent B was 2% water in acetonitrile
with 0.1% formic acid). The ion spray voltage was set at
2300 V, and source temperature at 160C. The declus-
tering voltage was 100 V, and collision energy value was
selected for each transition as generated by Multi-
Quant software (AB Sciex, USA). To ensure sensitive

and reliable quantification, tryptic peptides and SRM
transitions were generated by MRMPilot software (AB
SCIEX, USA) based on common chemical rules of pep-
tide fragmentation. The specificity of each peptide was
verified using BLAST alignment against the NCBI-NR
human protein database. Raw SRM-MS data was pre-
processed using MultiQuant 2.0.2 software (AB SCIEX).
A 2-point Gaussian smoothing window was applied to
all transition peaks. Peak area for each transition was
averaged over three replicate experiments per resistant
and sensitive cell line sample; fold-change was calculated
from the ratio of the average peak area in resistant cells
to that in sensitive cells. A transition was discarded if
peak area coefficient of variation (CV) across replicates
was greater than 0.2 or peak area in any replicate was
below the 25th percentile. Peptides with at least 2 tran-
sitions satisfying these constraints were conserved.

Results
Cisplatin resistance in A2780cis correlates with changes in
cellular morphology consistent with EMT signaling
We examined the morphological characteristics of the
cell lines during exponential growth. Parental A2780
cells formed cohesive clusters with round cellular mor-
phology in vitro (Figure 1a), consistent with an epithelial
phenotype. In contrast, A2780cis cells, grown in the pre-
sence of 1 M cisplatin, display a spindle-like morphol-
ogy and formed dyscohesive sheets (Figure 1b).
Additionally, the resistant cells exhibit the formation of
pseudopodia (Figure 1b, inset), not seen in the parental
cells.

Whole transcriptome profiling and LC/SRM-MS analysis
identify components of EMT signaling networks in
A2780cis relative to A2780
To confirm the involvement of EMT elements in the
development of cisplatin resistance, whole transcriptome
microarrays (Agilent, Mississauga, Canada) were used to

more fibroblastic appearance and demonstrate reduced intercellular

compare gene expression between A2780 and A2780cis
cells during exponential growth. In repeated assays,
EMT pathway elements, including snail, slug, twist2 and
zeb2, were over-expressed in the cisplatin-resistant cell
line relative to the parental line (Figure 2a). Technical
validation by qRT-PCR using Taqman assays confirmed
relative overexpression of snail by 3.7  0.3 (SD) fold
and slug by 6.9  0.4 (SD) fold, in the drug-resistant
cells compared to the drug-sensitive cells (Figure 2b).
Protein analysis by liquid chromatography/selected reac-
tion monitoring mass spectrometry (LC/SRM-MS) con-
firmed upregulation of Snail, Slug and vimentin, as well
as downregulation of epithelial marker E-cadherin in the
drug resistant cells relative to the drug sensitive cells
(Table 1).

Cisplatin resistant cells display increased potential for
migration and invasion
Migratory capacity was measured using Boyden chamber
assays. In three independent experiments, 23.7  5.1

Figure 2 Upregulation of genes associated with EMT in
resistant cells. Genes known to regulate EMT were shown to be
upregulated in the A2780cis cells compared to the A2780 cells. Data
from the gene expression microarrays (a) and technical validation of
snail and slug expression levels using qRT-PCR TaqMan assay (b)
demonstrate that upregulation. Approximate fold change calculated
as Ct for snail is 3.7  0.3 (p-value = 0.0008) and for slug is 6.9 
0.4 (p-value = 0.001).

drug sensitive cells and 194.0  7.0 drug-resistant cells
migrated through the membrane after 24 hours (p-value
= 0.003) (Figure 3c). Resistant cells also showed a five-
fold increased invasive capability relative to sensitive
cells using a Matrigel-coated Boyden chamber assay.
After 24 hours, an average of 36.3  5.03 sensitive cells
and 188.3  4.04 resistant cells invaded the matrix (p-
value = 0.003) (Figure 3c).

Knockdown of snail and slug reverses the EMT phenotype
and reduces cellular resistance to cisplatin
SiRNA was used to reduce the levels of snail and slug
transcript in the A2780cis cells to those of the parent
line (A2780cisSN - snail knockdown,
A2780 cell
A2780cisSL - slug knockdown, A2780cisSN/SL - both
snail and slug knocked down). Knockdown of these
genes was confirmed by qRT-PCR (results not shown)
and resulted in reversion of cell morphology of the
resistant cells to that of the parent cell line (Figure 3a).
Additionally, the knockdowns resulted in a reduction of
the doubling time of the resistant cells from 45.7  2.4
hours to 31.1  2.4 hours (p-value = 0.017), similar to
the 27.3  1.6 hour doubling time of the drug-sensitive
A2780 cells (p-value = 0.15) (Figure 3b). Migratory
capacity of the transfected cells was reduced from 194.0
 7.0 (untransfected controls) to 33.67  3.1 cells
migrating through the membrane (p-value = 0.002) (Fig-
ure 3c). Invasive capability was reduced from 188.3 
4.04 (untransfected controls) to 56  4.58 cells invading
the matrix (p-value = 0.004) (Figure 3c). Finally, we
showed increased cellular sensitivity to cisplatin in
transfected cells relative to controls (Figure 4). Following
48 hours of growth in 10 M cisplatin, transfected cells
displayed 62  2.5% cell death compared to controls at
37  2.4% (p-value = 0.005). As a comparator, parental
drug-sensitive cells displayed 75  3.3% cell death.

Drug resistant human ovarian tumours can be
differentiated from drug sensitive ovarian tumours using
a biomarker panel of EMT-related genes
Human ovarian tumour samples were classified as che-
mosensitive (progression-free interval of greater than 18
months) or chemoresistant (progression-free interval of
less than 6 months) based on available clinical data
(Additional file 1: Table S1). Gene expression data from
17 sensitive and 11 resistant tumours were mined to
investigate the relative expression levels of EMT-related
genes. In addition to snail, slug, twist2 and zeb2, the
resistant tumour samples also showed increased expres-
sion of twist1 and zeb1, two other important regulators
of EMT (Figure 5a). We used published information
about EMT to derive a list of 17 additional genes with a
role directly upstream or downstream of Snail and Slug
(Table 2). Unsupervised hierarchical clustering using

Summary of SRM-MS quantification results for E-Cadherin, Vimentin, Snail, and Slug. Mean peak area and coefficient of variation (CV) for each peptide fragment
ion were derived from peak areas measured in three replicate assays of each of the sensitive and resistant cell line samples. Transitions with CV > 0.20 in either
sample are not shown

expression data from those genes allowed reasonable
separation between the drug sensitive and drug resistant
ovarian tumours (Figure 5b).

Discussion
Ovarian cancer exhibits a high rate of platinum sensitiv-
ity in the first-line setting, but resistance frequently
develops in recurrent disease [38]. As such, understand-
ing the signaling networks that regulate chemoresistance
is critical for successful treatment. This can be said of
any cancer commonly treated with cisplatin such as
small cell lung cancer, head and neck cancer, colorectal
and hepatocelluar cancers.

While EMT has been widely studied for its role in
early development and, more recently, cancer metastasis,
it may also contribute to a cellular ability to evade the
effects of platinum-based therapies. EMT results in the
transformation of a differentiated epithelial cell to a
mesenchymal cell with stem-like properties, and is char-
acterized by loss of cell-to-cell adhesion, specifically
through the dismantling of adherens, tight and gap junc-
tions, as well as loss of cell polarity and increased moti-
lity [39].
In embryogenesis, EMT functions by
promoting migration of mesenchymal cells, first, during
gastrulation and neural crest cell migration, then later

during tissue remodeling and organogenesis, ultimately
contributing to the development of differentiated tissues
with specific phenotypes [18]. In cancer progression,
EMT appears to be at least partially responsible for the
invasive nature of tumour cells and facilitates metastasis
by converting a non-motile cancerous epithelial cell into
a motile mesenchymal cell capable of disseminating
from the tumour mass and entering the circulatory or
lymphatic system [40]. It is widely believed that embryo-
genesis and cancer metastasis represent two facets of
EMT, the former, a self-contained process that functions
to generate diverse cell types and tissues, while the latter
is affected by oncogenes and tumour suppressor genes
resulting in invasion and metastatic spread through the
circulatory system [41,42].

It is likely that EMT in drug resistance may rely on
many of the same transcription factors that function in
embryogenesis and metastasis-related EMT, although
details of their regulation are largely unknown. Studies
from embryology and metastasis provide evidence to
suggest that these cellular changes provide a survival
advantage to cells under chemotoxic stress, for example,
by down-regulating pro-apoptotic factors such as cas-
pases and Dap1, or up-regulating anti-apoptotic factors
Dad1 and Bcl2 [43,44]. Additionally, oxaliplatin-resistant

Figure 3 Knockdown of snail and slug reverses EMT phenotype. Snail and slug knockdown resulted in an epithelial morphology (a) and
reduced the doubling time of the A2780cisSN/SL cells (p-value = 0.017) compared to the A2780cis cells (b). Additionally, knockdown of snail
and slug resulted in a reduction in migration from 194.0  7.0 cells to 33.67  3.1 cells migrating through the membrane (p-value = 0.002) as
well as reducing invasion rate from 188.3  4.04 cells to 56  4.58 invading the matrix (p-value = 0.004), in each case, making the A2780cisSN/SL
knockdown cells more similar to the A2780 cell line, having migration and invasion rates of 23.7  5.1 and 36.3  5.03, respectively (c). The
control group, A2780cis cells transfected with a scrambled siRNA sequence, show no statistically significant changes in morphology, doubling
time, migration or invasion.

colorectal cancer cells have been shown to display many
of the hallmarks of EMT, including increased migration
and invasion as well as a spindle-cell shape, loss of
polarity and formation of pseudopodia [45]. Increased
expression of zeb1 and decreased expression of E-cad-
herin have been associated with drug resistant pancrea-
tic cell lines and reduction of zeb1 expression has been
implicated in increased drug sensitivity [46]. In ovarian
cancer cell lines, upregulation of snail and slug has been
correlated with resistance to radiation and paclitaxel and
shown to directly participate in p53-mediated pro-survi-
val signaling [47]. Therefore the idea that the EMT
genes play a significant role in cisplatin resistance in
ovarian cancer is supported by previous evidence, and

our own demonstration of a direct impact of these
genes on platinum resistance.

Through the manipulation of key EMT signaling
molecules, we have been able to show that we can re-
sensitize drug resistant cells to the effects of cisplatin,
approaching wild-type sensitivity after 72 hours in cul-
ture. Our findings suggest that genes known to regu-
late EMT directly contribute to cisplatin resistance in
this ovarian cancer model. We do recognize that the
A2780 cell line may not provide a faithful model of
serous ovarian carcinoma, given that lineage fidelity for
this line may not be maintained in long term culture.
However, we conclude that the translation of our cell
line derived results to a series of primary ovarian

carcinomas provides evidence for the effectiveness of
this model in this instance. We have demonstrated
that a panel of EMT-related genes provides a reason-
able model of classifying primary ovarian tumours
according to their chemoresistance status. While we
recognize that optimization of the biomarker panel
would be required before suggesting this could provide
a clinical benefit, this initial gene list identifies key dif-
ferences in the underlying molecular circuitry of drug
sensitive and resistant ovarian tumours. We have not
determined whether this signature derives entirely
from tumour cells, given that we did not enrich for
tumour cells in our experiments; however, the fact that
all of the primary tumours showed at least 70%
tumour cells by histology would support the idea that
the tumour likely contributes substantially to the sig-
nature we noted. To our knowledge, this is the first
study in primary tumours demonstrating an EMT gene
signature that can be used to differentiate between
chemosensitive and chemoresistant human ovarian
tumours and suggests that our overall findings may
provide important clues about chemotherapy resistance
in ovarian cancer.

Conclusions
In summary, we have demonstrated, through the use of
an ovarian cancer cell line, A2780, and its cisplatin-
resistant daughter line, A2780cis, that the genes that
regulate the epithelial to mesenchymal transition directly
contribute to cisplatin-resistance in ovarian cancer. We
have shown that when snail and slug, two key regulators

Cells with snail and slug knockdowns were grown in 10 M
cisplatin for 48 hours and cell survival was determined by MTT
assay. Approximately 75  3.3% of the drug sensitive cells died after
treatment compared to 37  2.4% of the drug resistant cells. With
snail and slug knockdown, cell death was significantly increased to
62  2.5% (p-value = 0.005).

tumours. EMT gene signatures are present in primary drug resistant
ovarian tumours. (a) Gene expression arrays identify increased
expression of genes integral to EMT in the resistant tumours relative
to the sensitive tumours. (b) Unsupervised hierarchical clustering
based on a panel of genes related to EMT supports differentiation
between drug sensitive (blue) and drug resistant (red) tumours.

of EMT, are knocked down in our cisplatin resistant cell
line, the EMT phenotype is largely reversed and drug
sensitivity is restored. Additionally, we demonstrate that
this gene signature is present in drug resistant human
ovarian tumours and that we can distinguish between
drug sensitive and drug resistant ovarian tumours using
the differential expression of a panel of EMT-related
genes. Therefore, as it appears that EMT is connected
to the drug resistant phenotype, this process and corre-
sponding signaling network may be relevant biomarkers
of drug resistance in ovarian cancer. Additionally, these
molecules may represent targets for novel therapeutic
strategies, used to overcome chemotherapy resistance in
ovarian cancer, thereby modulating drug response in
these patients and reducing the mortality rate associated
with this disease.
