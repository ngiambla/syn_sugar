Abstract 

In a Bayesian mixture model it is not necessary a priori to limit the num(cid:173)
ber of components to be finite.  In this paper an infinite Gaussian mixture 
model is  presented which neatly sidesteps the difficult problem of find(cid:173)
ing the "right" number of mixture components. Inference in the model is 
done using an efficient parameter-free Markov Chain that relies entirely 
on Gibbs sampling.

Introduction 

One of the major advantages in the Bayesian methodology is  that "overfitting" is avoided; 
thus  the difficult task of adjusting model complexity  vanishes.  For neural networks,  this 
was  demonstrated by Neal [1996]  whose  work on infinite networks led to  the reinvention 
and  popularisation of Gaussian Process  models  [Williams  &  Rasmussen,  1996].  In this 
paper  a  Markov  Chain  Monte  Carlo  (MCMC)  implementation  of a  hierarchical  infinite 
Gaussian  mixture model  is  presented.  Perhaps  surprisingly,  inference  in  such models  is 
possible using finite amounts of computation. 

Similar models are  known  in statistics  as  Dirichlet Process mixture models  and  go  back 
to  Ferguson  [1973]  and  Antoniak  [1974].  Usually,  expositions  start  from  the  Dirichlet 
process itself [West et al,  1994]; here we derive the model as the limiting case of the well(cid:173)
known finite  mixtures.  Bayesian methods for  mixtures with  an unknown (finite)  number 
of components have been explored by Richardson &  Green [1997], whose methods are not 
easily extended to multivariate observations. 

2  Finite hierarchical mixture 

The finite  Gaussian mixture model with  k  components may be written as: 

P(yl/l-l, ... ,/l-k,Sl,· ..  ,Sk,7rl,· .. , 7rk)  = L7rjN(/l-j,sjl), 

k 

(1) 

j=l 

where /l-j  are  the means,  Sj  the precisions (inverse variances),  7rj  the mixing proportions 
(which must be positive and sum to one) and N  is  a (normalised) Gaussian with specified 
mean and variance.  For simplicity, the exposition will initially assume scalar observations, 
n  of which  comprise  the  training  data  y  = {Yl, ... , Yn}.  First  we  will  consider these 
models for a fixed value of k, and later explore the properties in the limit where k  -+  00.

Gibbs sampling is  a well known technique for generating samples from complicated mul(cid:173)
tivariate distributions that  is  often used in Monte Carlo procedures.  In  its  simplest form, 
Gibbs  sampling  is  used  to  update  each  variable  in  turn  from  its  conditional distribution 
given all other variables in the system. It can be shown that Gibbs sampling generates sam(cid:173)
ples from the joint distribution, and that the entire distribution is explored as the number of 
Gibbs sweeps grows large. 

We introduce stochastic indicator variables, Ci, one for each observation, whose role is  to 
encode  which  class  has  generated  the  observation;  the  indicators  take  on  values  1 ... k. 
Indicators are often referred to as "missing data" in a mixture model context. 

In  the  following  sections  the  priors  on  component parameters and  hyperparameters  will 
be  specified,  and the  conditional distributions  for  these,  which  will  be  needed for  Gibbs 
sampling, will be derived.  In general  the form of the priors are chosen to have (hopefully) 
reasonable modelling properties, with an eye to mathematical convenience (through the use 
of conjugate priors). 

2.1  Component parameters 

The component means, f.1j,  are given Gaussian priors: 

(2) 
whose  mean,  A,  and  precision,  r,  are  hyperparameters common  to  all  components.  The 
hyperparameters themselves are given vague Normal and Gamma priors: 

p(f.1jIA,r)  ",N(A,r- 1), 

p(A)  ",N(f.1Y,Cl;), 

(3) 
where f.1y  and 0-;  are the mean and variance of the observations 1.  The shape parameter of 
the Gamma prior is set to  unity, corresponding to a very broad (vague) distribution. 

p(r) "'9(1 ,Cl;2)  ocr- 1/ 2 exp(-rCl;/2), 

The conditional posterior distributions for the means are obtained by multiplying the like(cid:173)
lihood from eq.  (1) conditioned on the indicators, by the prior, eq. (2): 

ilJ  =  -

"" Yi, 
n·  ~ 
J  i:Ci=j 

(4) 

where the occupation number, nj, is  the number of observations belonging to class j, and 
'[jj  is  the  mean of these observations.  For the  hyperparameters,  eg.  (2)  plays  the  role of 
the  likelihood which  together  with  the  priors  from  eq.  (4)  give  conditional posteriors of 
standard form:

The component precisions, S j, are given Gamma priors: 

(6) 
whose  shape,  j3,  and mean,  w- 1 ,  are hyperparameters common  to  all  components,  with 
priors of inverse Gamma and Gamma form: 

p(Sjlj3,w)  '" 9(j3,w-1), 

(7) 

1 Strictly speaking,  the priors ought not to  depend on the  observations.  The current procedure  is 
equivalent to nonnalising the observations and using unit priors. A wide variety of reasonable priors 
will lead to similar results.

The conditional posterior precisions are obtained by multiplying the likelihood from eq. (1) 
conditioned on the indicators, by the prior, eq. (6): 

p(sjlc, y, /Lj,,8, w)  '" 9(,8 + nj, [,8: n' (w,8 + . L (Yi -

/Lj)2)] -1). 

(8) 

J 

t :C;=J 

For the hyperparameters, eq. (6) plays the role of likelihood which together with the priors 
from eq. (7) give: 

The latter density is not of standard form, but it can be shown that p(log(,8) lSI, ... , Sk, w) 
is  log-concave, so  we may generate independent samples from the distribution for log(,8) 
using the Adaptive Rejection Sampling (ARS)  technique [Gilks &  Wild,  1992], and trans(cid:173)
form these to get values for ,8. 

The mixing proportions, 7rj,  are given a symmetric Dirichlet (also  known as  multivariate 
beta) prior with concentration parameter a/ k: 

P(""'"  , ".1<»  ~ Dirichlet(<>/ k, ... , <>/ k) =  r~(;1). }1,,;/.-1, 

k 

(10) 

where the mixing proportions must be positive and sum to one.  Given the mixing propor(cid:173)
tions, the prior for the occupation numbers, n j, is multinomial and the joint distribution of 
the indicators becomes: 

P(Cl, ... ,ckl 7rl, ...  , 7rk)  = II 7r;i, 

k 

n 

nj =  L 8Kronecker(Ci,j). 

(11) 

j=1 

i=1 

Using  the  standard Dirichlet integral,  we  may  integrate  out the  mixing  proportions and 
write the prior directly in terms of the indicators: 

P(Cl, ... ,ckla ) =  /  P(Cl, . ..  ,ckl 7rl, .. '  , 7rk)p( 7rl, ... ,7rk)d7rl···d7rk

r(n + a)  j=1 
. 

r(a/k) 

In  order  to  be  able  to  use  Gibbs  sampling  for  the  (discrete)  indicators,  Ci,  we  need  the 
conditional prior for  a  single  indicator given  all  the  others;  this  is  easily  obtained  from 
eq. (12) by keeping all but a single indicator fixed: 

( 
p  Ci  = J  C-i, a  = 

'1 

)  n-i,j + a/k 
, 
n-l+a 

(13) 

where the subscript -i indicates all indexes except i  and n-i,j is  the number of observa(cid:173)
tions, excluding Yi,  that are associated with component j. The posteriors for the indicators 
are derived in the next section. 

Lastly, a vague prior of inverse Gamma shape is put on the concentration parameter a: 

p(a- l )  '" 9(1,1)  = }  p(a)  oc  a- 3 / 2 exp( - 1/(2a)). 

(14) 

The Infinite Gaussian Mixture Model 

557 

The likelihood  for 0:  may  be  derived  from  eq.  (12),  which  together  with  the  prior from 
eq. (14) gives: 

p(nl, ... ,nklo:)  =  r(n + 0:)'

(  I 
po: k,n)  ex 

o:k-3/2 exp( - 1/(20:))r(0:) 
. 

r(n + 0:) 

( 15) 

Notice, that the conditional posterior for 0:  depends only on number of observations, n, and 
the number of components, k, and not on how the observations are distributed among the 
components. The distribution p(log( 0:) I k, n) is log-concave, so we may efficiently generate 
independent samples from this distribution using ARS. 

3  The infinite limit 

So far,  we  have considered k  to  be a  fixed  finite  quantity.  In  this section we  will explore 
the  limit  k  -7  00  and make  the  final  derivations regarding the  conditional posteriors for 
the indicators.  For all the model variables except the indicators, the conditional posteriors 
for the infinite limit is obtained by substituting for k  the number of classes that have data 
associated with them, krep ,  in the equations previously derived for the finite model. For the 
indicators, letting k  -7  00 in eq. (13), the conditional prior reaches the following limits: 

components where n-i,j > 0: 

all  other  compo(cid:173)
nents combined: 

n-l+o:' 

0: 

n-l+o:

(16) 

This shows that the conditional class prior for components that are  associated  with other 
observations is  proportional  to  the  number of such observations;  the  combined prior for 
all  other classes  depends only on 0:  and  n.  Notice how  the  analytical  tractability  of the 
integral in eq. (12) is essential, since it allows us  to  work directly with  the  (finite number 
of)  indicator variables,  rather than the (infinite number of)  mixing proportions.  We  may 
now combine the likelihood from eq. (1) conditioned on the indicators with  the prior from 
eq. (16) to obtain the conditional posteriors for the indicators: 

componentsforwhichn_i,j  > 0:  P(Ci  =jlc-i,ltj,Sj,o:) ex 

P(Ci  =  jlc-i, o:)p(YiI Itj ,Sj ,c-d ex

all other components combined:  p(Ci:j:.  Ci'  for all i  :j:.  i'lc-i, A, r, (3, W, 0:)  ex: 

p(Ci:j:.  Ci'  foralli:j:. i'lc-i,O:) J p(Yilltj,sj)p(ltj,sjIA,r,{3,w)dltjdsj . 

The likelihood for  components  with  observations other than Yi  currently associated  with 
them is  Gaussian with component parameters Itj  and Sj.  The likelihood pertaining to the 
currently unrepresented classes  (which have  no  parameters associated  with  them)  is  ob(cid:173)
tained  through  integration  over the  prior distribution  for  these.  Note,  that  we  need  not 
differentiate between the infinitely many unrepresented classes,  since their parameter dis(cid:173)
tributions are all identical. Unfortunately, this integral is not analytically tractable; I follow 
Neal  [1998],  who  suggests  to  sample  from  the  priors  (which  are  Gaussian  and  Gamma 
shaped) in order to generate a Monte Carlo estimate of the probability of "generating a new 
class".  Notice, that this approach effectively generates parameters (by sampling from the 
prior) for the classes that are unrepresented.  Since this Monte Carlo estimate is unbiased, 
the resulting chain will sample from exactly the desired distribution, no matter how many 
samples are used to approximate the integral; I have found that using a single sample works 
fairly well in many applications. 
In detail, there are three possibilities when computing conditional posterior class probabil(cid:173)
ities, depending on the number of observations associated with the class: 

558 

C. E.  Rasmussen 

if n-i,j > 0:  there are other observations associated with class j, and the posterior class 

probability is as given by the top line of eq. (17). 

if n - i,j = a and Ci  = j:  observation Yi  is  currently the only observation associated with 
class j; this is an peculiar situation, since there are no other observations associ(cid:173)
ated with the class, but the class still has parameters. It turns out that this situation 
should be handled as  an unrepresented class, but rather than sampling for the pa(cid:173)
rameters, one simply uses the class parameters; consult [Neal  1998] for a detailed 
derivation. 

unrepresented classes:  values for  the mixture parameters are picked at random from the 

prior for these parameters, which is Gaussian for J.Lj  and Gamma shaped for Sj. 

Now  that all  classes  have  parameters  associated  with  them,  we  can easily evaluate  their 
likelihoods (which are Gaussian)  and the priors, which take  the form n-i,jl(n - 1 + a) 
for components with observations other than Yi  associated with them, and al (n  - 1 + a) 
for  the  remaining class.  When  hitherto  unrepresented classes  are chosen,  a  new  class  is 
introduced in the model; classes are removed when they become empty. 

4  Inference;  the "spirals" example 

To illustrate the model, we use the 3 dimensional "spirals" dataset from [Ueda et aI,  1998], 
containing 800 data point, plotted in figure  1.  Five data points are generated from each of 
160 isotropic Gaussians, whose means follow a spiral pattern.

the Gaussian mixture components; the thickness of the lines represent the mass of the class. 
To the right histograms for 100 samples from the posterior for  krep ,  a and f3  are shown. 

4.1  Multivariate generalisation 

The  generalisation  to  multivariate  observations  is  straightforward.  The  means,  J.Lj,  and 
precisions,  S j, become  vectors  and  matrices respectively,  and  their prior (and  posterior) 

The Infinite Gaussian Mixture Model

distributions become multivariate Gaussian and Wishart.  Similarly, the hyperparameter A 
becomes a vector (multivariate Gaussian prior) and rand w become matrices with Wishart 
priors. The (3  parameter stays scalar, with the prior on ((3  - D  + 1)-1 being Gamma with 
mean 1/ D, where D  is the dimension of the dataset.  All other specifications stay the same. 
Setting D  =  1 recovers the scalar case discussed in detail. 

4.2 

Inference 

The mixture model is started with a single component, and a large number of Gibbs sweeps 
are performed, updating all  parameters and hyperparameters in turn by sampling from the 
conditional distributions derived in the previous sections.  In figure  2  the auto-covariance 
for several quantities is plotted, which reveals a maximum correlation-length of about 270. 
Then 30000 iterations  are performed for  modelling purposes  (taking  18  minutes of CPU 
time on a Pentium PC) : 3000 steps initially for  "burn-in", followed by 27000 to  generate 
100 roughly independent samples from the posterior (spaced evenly 270  apart).  In figure 
1,  the  represented  components  of one  sample  from  the  posterior  is  visualised  with  the 
data.  To  the  right of figure  1 we  see  that  the posterior number of represented classes  is 
very  concentrated around  18 - 20,  and the concentration parameter takes  values around 
a  :::::  3.5 corresponding to only a/ (n + a)  :::::  0.4% of the mass of the predictive distribution 
belonging to unrepresented classes.  The shape parameter (3  takes values around 5-6, which 
gives the "effective number of points" contributed from the prior to the covariance matrices 
of the mixture components. 

4.3  The predictive distribution 

Given a particular state in the Markov Chain, the predictive distribution has two parts:  the 
represented classes (which are Gaussian) and the unrepresented classes. As when updating 
the indicators, we may chose to approximate the unrepresented classes by a finite  mixture 
of Gaussians, whose parameters are drawn from the prior.  The final predictive distribution 
is an average over the (eg. 100) samples from the posterior. For the spirals data this density 
has roughly 1900 components for the represented classes plus however many are used to 
represent the remaining mass. I have not attempted to show this distribution. However, one 
can imagine a  smoothed version of the single  sample shown in figure  1,  from  averaging 
over models  with  slightly varying numbers of classes and parameters.  The (small)  mass 
from the unrepresented classes spreads diffusely over the entire observation range.

5  Conclusions 

C.  E.  Rasmussen 

The infinite hierarchical Bayesian mixture model has  been reviewed and extended into a 
practical method.  It has  been shown that good performance (without overfitting)  can be 
achieved on multidimensional data.  An  efficient and practical MCMC algorithm with no 
free parameters has been derived and demonstrated on an example.  The model is fully au(cid:173)
tomatic, without needing specification of parameters of the (vague) prior. This corroborates 
the falsity  of the  common misconception that "the only difference between Bayesian and 
non-Bayesian methods is the prior, which is arbitrary anyway ... ". 

Further  tests  on  a  variety  of problems  reveals  that  the  infinite  mixture  model  produces 
densities  whose generalisation is  highly competitive with other commonly used methods. 
Current work is undertaken to explore performance on high dimensional problems, in terms 
of computational efficiency and generalisation. 

The infinite mixture model has  several advantages over its  finite  counterpart:  1)  in many 
applications, it may be more appropriate not to limit the number of classes, 2)  the number 
of represented classes is automatically determined, 3) the use of MCMC effectively avoids 
local minima which plague mixtures trained by optimisation based methods, ego EM [Ueda 
et aI,  1998]  and 4)  it  is  much simpler to  handle the infinite limit than  to  work  with  finite 
models with  unknown sizes,  as  in  [Richardson &  Green,  1997]  or traditional approaches 
based on extensive crossvalidation. The Bayesian infinite mixture model solves simultane(cid:173)
ously several long-standing problems with mixture models for density estimation.
