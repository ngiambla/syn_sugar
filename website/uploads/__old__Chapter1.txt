Organic chemistry describes the structures, properties, preparation, and reactions of a vast 
array of molecules that we call organic compounds.  There are many different types of 
organic compounds, but all have carbon as their principal constituent atom.  These carbon 
atoms form a carbon skeleton or carbon backbone that has other bonded atoms such as H, 
N, O, S, and the halogens (F, Cl, Br, and I).   
 
We frequently hear the term "organic" in everyday language where it describes or refers to 
substances that are "natural".  This is probably a result of the notion of early scientists that all 
organic compounds came from living systems and possessed a "vital force".  However, 
chemists learned over 170 years ago that this is not the case.  Organic compounds are major 
components of living systems, but chemists can make many of them in the laboratory from 
substances that have no direct connection with living systems.  Chemically speaking, a pure 
sample of an organic compound such as Vitamin C prepared in a laboratory is chemically 
identical to a pure sample of Vitamin C isolated from a natural source such as an orange or 
other citrus fruit. 
 
Your journey through organic chemistry will be challenging because of the large amount of 
information that you will need to learn and understand.  However, we will explore this 
subject in a systematic manner so that it is not a vast collection of isolated facts.  What you 
learn in one chapter will serve as building blocks for the material in the chapter that follows 
it.  In this sense, you may find that organic chemistry is different from general chemistry.  
That course consists of a variety of discrete topics usually divided into separate segments in 
textbooks.  In contrast, your organic chemistry instructors will present a course in which each 
new topic uses information from previous topics to raise your understanding of organic 
chemistry to successively higher levels. 
 
This chapter provides a foundation for your studies of organic chemistry.  It begins with an 
introduction to the important classes of organic molecules followed by a description of

chemical bonding in those molecules. It concludes with a brief survey of the various topics 
in organic chemistry and a description of the way that we present them in this text. 
 

1.1 Organic Molecules 

All organic molecules contain carbon (C), virtually all of them contain hydrogen (H), and 
most contain oxygen (O) and/or nitrogen (N) atoms.  Many organic molecules also have 
halogen atoms such as fluorine (F), chlorine (Cl), bromine (Br), or iodine (I).  Other atoms in 
organic compounds include sulfur (S), phosphorous (P), and even boron (B), aluminum (Al), 
and magnesium (Mg).   
 
The number of different types of atoms in organic compounds suggests they are structurally 
complex.  Fortunately, we find these atoms in a relatively few specific arrangements because 
of their preferred bonding characteristics.  For example, C atoms primarily bond to each 
other to form the molecular skeleton or backbone of organic molecules, while H atoms 
bond to the various C atoms, or to other atoms such as N and O, almost like a "skin" 
surrounding the molecule.  You can see some of these features in the organic molecule lauric 
acid that is one of a group of molecules called fatty acids.  [graphic 1.1]  Since atoms such as 
N, O, and the halogens (generally referred to as X) connect to the carbon skeleton in 
characteristic ways that determine the properties of a molecule, we call these groups of atoms 
functional groups.  Functional groups define the class to which the organic molecule 
belongs. 
 
Bonding Characteristics of Atoms  (1.1A) 
You can see that most of the atoms that we have mentioned above are in the first three rows 
of the periodic table.  [graphic 1.2]  However, it is their location in a particular column of 
the periodic table that tells us how many chemical bonds they usually form to other atoms in 
a molecule.  For example, C and Si are in the fourth column (Group 4A) and they each 
typically have four bonds in their molecules, while F, Cl, Br, and I are in Column 7A and 
they typically form just one bond.   
 

Periodic Tables.  The partial periodic table shown here does not include columns with the "transition 
elements" (Groups 1B through 8B).  We show these in the full periodic table located inside the cover 
of your text.  Some of these transition elements are present in organic molecules, but to a much smaller 
extent than the other atoms we have mentioned.  We will consider bonding preferences of transition 
elements as needed throughout the text.

  Bonds and Unshared Electron Pairs for C, N, O, and F.  C, N, O, and halogens such as 
F, are particularly important atoms in organic molecules.  The neutral compounds that they 
form with H (CH4, NH3, H2O, and HF) illustrate their bonding preferences.  You can see in 
Figure [graphic 1.3] that each atom in these molecules has the preferred number of bonds that 
we listed at the bottom of our partial periodic table (Figure [graphic 1.2]).  [graphic 1.3]   
 
Besides their chemical bonds (bonding electron pairs), we show that N, O, and F have 
unshared electron pairs that are not in chemical bonds.  The combined total of number of 
bonds and number of unshared electron pairs that we show equals 4 for C, N, O, or F.  Since 
each chemical bond contains 2 electrons, our drawings of these molecules show 8 electrons 
on C, N, O, or F that come from their bonds and these unshared electron pairs.     
 
Because each of these atoms has 8 electrons in bonds and unshared pairs, they satisfy the 
"octet rule".  The "octet rule" states that atoms in rows 2 and 3 of the partial periodic table 
prefer to form compounds where they have 8 electrons in their outer valence electron shell.  
C, N, O, and F obey this rule not only in these compounds, but in all stable organic 
compounds.   
 
These characteristics of C, N, O, and F are so important that we summarize their preferred 
number of bonds and unshared electron pairs again in Figure [graphic 1.4] and offer the 
reminder that they are identical to those in CH4, NH3, H2O, and HF.  [graphic 1.4]  (We give 
a more detailed description of bonds and electron pairs in these atoms on the next page at the 
end of this section.) 
 
  Bonds and Unshared Electron Pairs for Other Atoms.  H and other atoms in column 
1A, as well as those in columns 2A, and 3A  of Figure [graphic 1.2] do not have enough 
outer shell electrons to achieve an octet when they form bonds so they have no unshared 
electron pairs in their compounds.  Si (column 4a) typically has four bonds and no unshared 
electron pairs like C.  The halogen atoms Cl, Br, and I have the same number of unshared 
electron pairs and preferred bonds as F because they are all in the same column.  When P and 
S have 3 and 2 bonds, respectively, they have the same number of unshared electron pairs as 
N and O.  However P and S sometimes form compounds where they have more than 8 outer 
valence shell electrons.

Structures of Organic Molecules.  In the following sections, we use the preferred 

 
numbers of bonds for C, H, N, O, and the halogen atoms (X) to draw structures for common 
types of organic molecules and describe their organization into specific classes.  We follow 
this introduction with a detailed description of their chemical bonds.

The Basis for the Number of Bonds and Unshared Electrons on C, N, O, and F.  The number of 
bonds and unshared electrons on C, N, O, and F in their compounds depends on the total number of 
electrons of each free atom as described here:    
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(a) The total number of electrons is identical to the atomic number of the atom.   
(b) C, N, O, or F each has 2 inner shell electrons not shown in the drawings. 
(c) The number of outer shell electrons equals [total electrons (a) - inner shell electrons (b)]. 
(d) The number of electrons to complete an octet is [8 - number of outer shell electrons]. 
(e) The preferred number of bonds to C, N, O, or F is identical to the number of electrons to complete 
an octet (d) since each new electron comes from another atom that forms a bond containing the new 
electron and one of the outer shell electrons of C, N, O, or F.   
(f) The number of unshared electrons on C, N, O, or F is the number of outer shell electrons not 
involved in forming chemical bonds to other atoms and this equals (c)-(d).  

 
Compounds with Four Single Bonds to C  (1.1B) 
We can think of CH4 as the simplest organic compound since it contains just one C with its 
four bonds to H atoms.  Now let's look at other examples where C bonds not only to H, but to 
other C's, as well as to N, O, or X.  These compounds include alkanes (C and H), 
haloalkanes (C, H, and X), alcohols and ethers (C, H, and O), and amines (C, H, and N). 
[graphic 1.5] 
 
  Alkanes (C-C and C-H Bonds).  Alkanes have C-H and C-C bonds and are the 
structural foundation for all other organic molecules.  While the simplest alkane CH4 has no 
C-C bonds (it contains only one C), C-C bonds are present in all other alkanes.  For example, 
you can draw a structure for the alkane H3C-CH3 (most often written CH3-CH3) by bonding 
two C atoms to each other and adding six H's to satisfy the bonding requirements of the C's.   

 

8 

(4,5,9,11,12/98)(1,9,10/99) 
 

Neuman 

Chapter 1 

[graphic 1.6]  We can draw CH3-CH2-CH3 with two C-C bonds in a similar way from 3 C 
atoms and 8 H's.  
 
By bonding more C's and H's in this way we can draw a series of alkanes such as those 
shown in Figure [graphic 1.7].  [graphic 1.7]  All of these alkanes result from adding H's to 
linear chains of C atoms, but we can bond C's to each other in other ways that we illustrate 
using four C atoms.  [graphic 1.8]  Besides the linear C4 skeleton, the four C's can be 
branched or in a ring.  Subsequent addition of H's gives a branched alkane or a cyclic 
alkane (cycloalkane), that are different than the linear alkane.  Alkanes and cycloalkanes  are 
called hydrocarbons because they contain only C and H atoms. 
 

Names of Organic Molecules.  We show individual names of alkanes for reference purposes.  These 
names come from a system of nomenclature that we will begin studying in Chapter 2.  You will learn 
how to name many organic molecules using relatively few nomenclature rules.  Alkanes serve not only 
as the basis for the structures of all other organic compounds, but also their nomenclature. 

  

More About Alkanes.  Alkanes occur naturally in the earth in petroleum and natural gas and have a 
variety of commercial uses.  Examples are methane (CH4) (the major component of natural gas) and 
propane (CH3CH2CH3) that are cooking and heating fuels.  Gasoline, used to power most 
automobiles, is a complex mixture of alkanes including hexanes (C6 alkanes), heptanes (C7 alkanes), 
octanes (C8 alkanes), and nonanes (C9 alkanes).  Alkanes also serve as starting materials for the 
preparation of other types of organic compounds that we are about to describe.   

 
  Compounds with C-X, C-O, or C-N Bonds.  Alkanes contain only C and H atoms, but 
most other organic compounds contain additional atoms.   We can draw structures for some 
of these, by replacing an H on an alkane (or cycloalkane) with an N, O, or halogen atom (X).  
We illustrate this below with the simplest alkane CH4 so the resulting compounds are the 
simplest examples of each class.  Since O and N atoms prefer more than one bond, we have 
added H's to complete their bonding requirements:

haloalkanes, alcohols, and amines.  They indicate that an X atom, an OH group, or an NH2 
group replaces an H atom in an alkane or cycloalkane (R-H) to give a haloalkane, alcohol, or 
amine such as the examples we show in Figure [graphic 1.9].  [graphic 1.9]  R represents all 
of the bonded C and H atoms other then the X, OH, or NH2 groups.  The OH group is called 
a hydroxyl (or hydroxy) group, or simply an alcohol group, while NH2 is an amino group.   
 
  Additional R Groups on N or O.  We can replace H's on the OH of R-OH and the NH2 of 
R-NH2 with R groups and this leads to the types of organic compounds shown here: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
When we replace H of an alcohol (R-O-H) with another R, we obtain a new class of organic 
compounds that we call ethers (R-O-R).  In contrast, when we replace one or both H's on R-
NH2 with other R's, we continue to call the resulting compounds amines!  We shall see in 
Chapter 3 that this apparent inconsistency results from observations of early chemists that the 
chemical and physical properties of alcohols (ROH) are quite different than those of ethers 
(ROR), while they are very similar for all amines (RNH2, RNHR, and RNR2).   
   
  Functional Groups.  We summarize how to draw alkanes, haloalkanes, alcohols, ethers, 
and amines using C, N, O, X, and H atoms in Figure [graphic 1.10].  [graphic 1.10]  We refer 
to the groups X, OH, OR, NH2, NHR, and NR2 as functional groups because they 
determine the physical properties and chemical reactions of their particular class of 
compounds.   
 
Compounds with Double and Triple Bonds to C  (1.1C) 
So far, all organic compounds that we have seen have C atoms with 4 single bonds to 4 other 
atoms.  [graphic 1.11]  Although C always prefers four bonds, we can provide these four 
bonds with 3 atoms or even 2 atoms using double or triple bonds.  [graphic 1.12]  We find 
such double and triple bonds in alkenes (C=C), alkynes (C≡C), imines (C=N), nitriles 
(C≡N), and aldehydes or ketones (C=O).  [graphic 1.13]

  Alkenes (C=C) and Alkynes (C≡C).  Alkenes contain a C=C double bond.  We can draw 
the simplest alkene H2C=CH2 by adding four H's to a C=C so that each C has four bonds.  
[graphic 1.14]  Alkenes are hydrocarbons that contain one C=C while all of their other C-C 
bonds are single bonds.  [graphic 1.15]  We think of the C=C bond as a functional group 
because it causes alkenes to be much more chemically reactive than alkanes.  Alkenes have 
the general structure R2C=CR2.  Alkynes are hydrocarbons with a C≡C bond and the 
general structure R-C≡C-R.  [graphic 1.16]  The C≡C triple bond is also a functional group 
that is more chemically reactive than a C-C single bond.  
 

Molecules with more than One C=C or C≡C.  Organic compounds can have more than one C=C or 
C≡C bond.  Many such compounds exist and have very important chemical and physical properties as 
we will see throughout this text.  A biologically important organic molecule called β-carotene has 
eleven C=C bonds.  [graphic 1.17]  Compounds with two C=C bonds are dienes, compounds with 
three C=C bonds are trienes, compounds with four C=C bonds are tetraenes, while compounds with 
many C=C bonds are polyenes.  Compounds with two or more C≡C bonds are named like polyenes 
except that the ending ene is replace with yne.  

General Formula 

 
  Compounds with C=N, C≡N, and C=O Bonds.  Organic compounds can also have 
double or triple bonds between C and N, and double bonds between C and O.   
These are some of the classes with these double and triple bonds:

*The atomic grouping C(=O)-R means that R and (=O) are directly bonded to C.  

 
As we saw for amines, imines can have either H or R on their N atom.  In contrast, the 
presence or absence of an H on the C of the C=O group distinguishes ketones and aldehydes.  
Aldehydes always have at least one H directly bonded to C=O (H-C=O), while ketones have 
no H's directly bonded to C=O.  [graphic 1.18]  We call C=O a carbonyl group whether it is 
in an aldehyde (R-C(=O)-H), or a ketone (R-C(=O)-R).  The C≡N group is referred to as a 
nitrile group, while C=N is usually not separately named.

Compounds With C=O Bonded to N, O, or X  (1.1D) 
We finish our survey of important classes of organic compounds, with the four classes that 
have N, O, or X bonded to C of the C=O group:   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Like amines and imines, amides can have H's and/or R's on N.  The O of the carboxyl group 
(C(=O)-O) can also bond to either an H or an R group, but the resulting compounds are 
separately classified as carboxylic acids or esters because of their very different properties.  
[graphic 1.20]  We illustrate how we can draw these compounds from the C=O group and N, 
O, or X in Figure [graphic 1.21].  [graphic 1.21] 
 
An Overview of Organic Functional Groups  (1.1E) 
Figure [graphic 1.22] summarizes all of the functional groups we have introduced in this 
chapter along with the names of their classes.  [graphic 1.22]  We have seen that we can 
systematically draw compounds in these classes by assembling C, N, O, X, and H atoms 
following the bonding requirements of these atoms that depend on their location in the 
periodic table.  We will consider each of these classes in detail in later chapters.   
 

Other Functional Groups.  You may wonder if there are additional organic functional groups that 
also follow the C, N, O, X, and H bonding requirements.  In fact, there are a variety of other 
possibilities, but many of them don't exist or are much less common.  In each of the functional groups 
that we have seen above, N, O, or X atoms bond only to C's and H's.  While a few functional groups 
are present in organic compounds that do have N, O, or X bonded to each other, we encounter them 
much less frequently than those that we have seen here and will introduce them as needed throughout 
the text.

1.2 Chemical Bonds 

Neuman 

Chapter 1 

Now that we have surveyed the important classes of organic molecules, it is time to talk 
about their chemical bonds.  We have shown these chemical bonds as lines between the 
atoms and stated that they represent pairs of electrons.  This representation of a bond makes 
it easy to draw structures of molecules, but in order to understand properties and chemical 
reactivity of molecules we need to look at these bonds more closely. 
 
Organic chemists describe chemical bonds in organic compounds using theoretical models 
such as the valence bond (VB) or the molecular orbital (MO) models that you may have 
studied in general chemistry.  Each has advantages and disadvantages and both are 
mathematically sophisticated.  In order to explain structural, physical, and chemical 
properties of organic molecules at a level appropriate to our needs in this course, we will use 
a pictorial description of chemical bonds based on these models that chemists call the 
localized molecular orbital model. 
 
Localized Molecular Orbitals  (1.2A) 
We will describe each chemical bond as a localized molecular orbital that overlaps the two 
bonded atoms and contains a pair of bonding electrons.  [graphic 1.23]  We form a localized 
molecular orbital by combining one atomic orbital from each of the two bonded atoms.  To 
illustrate this, let's look at the single chemical bond in molecular hydrogen (H-H) that we can 
imagine arises from combination of two H atoms.  We will see below that the single electron 
of an isolated H atom is in a spherical 1s atomic orbital.  [graphic 1.24]  Combination of the 
1s atomic orbitals from two H atoms gives a localized molecular orbital that surrounds the H 
atoms and contains the two electrons of the H-H bond.  From this point forward we will refer 
to localized molecular orbitals simply as molecular orbitals or MO's.   
  

Localized versus Delocalized Molecular Orbitals.  The complete molecular orbital theory for 
chemical bonding places the bonding electrons of a molecule in delocalized molecular orbitals that 
arise from simultaneous combination of all valence shell atomic orbitals of all atoms in the molecule.  
The electrons in delocalized molecular orbitals bind the atoms in a molecule into a cohesive structure, 
but these delocalized molecular orbitals do not provide the classical descriptions of chemical bonds 
between atoms familiar to you and routinely used by organic chemists.  In order to explain properties 
of organic molecules and their chemical reactions, we will treat most chemical bonds as electron pairs 
in localized molecular orbitals. In later chapters we will use certain types of delocalized molecular 
orbitals to explain structural, physical, and chemical properties not adequately described by localized 
molecular orbitals.

Bonding and Antibonding Molecular Orbitals.  Two molecular orbitals always arise from the 
combination of two atomic orbitals.  These are the bonding molecular orbital (shown above for H-H) 
and a molecular orbital with higher energy called an antibonding molecular orbital.  [graphic 1.25]  
The two electrons in a chemical bond are in the lower energy bonding molecular orbital.  We will not 
discuss antibonding molecular orbitals here since they contain no electrons, but we will see later in the 
text that they are important in determining chemical reactivity.    

 
Electronic Structure of Atoms (1.2B) 
Since we visualize a chemical bond as a molecular orbital with an electron pair formed by 
combination of two atomic orbitals that each contains one electron, it is important to review 
the electronic structures for the atoms that we find in organic molecules.   
 
  Electron Configurations.  Electron configurations of atoms describe the atomic orbital 
locations of electrons in these atoms, and we show them here for the first ten atoms in the 
periodic table. [graphic 1.26]  We represent the electrons as arrows pointing up or down to 
indicate their two possible spin states.  These electrons are in the lowest energy atomic 
orbitals consistent with the following rules that you studied in general chemistry: 

 (1)  An atomic orbital may contain no more than two electrons because electrons in the 

same orbital must have different spin states.  (Pauli Exclusion Principle) 

 (2)  All atomic orbitals of equal energy must each contain one electron before a second 

Table 1.1. 

Electron Configurations for Elements 1-10 

electron of opposite spin is added to any of them.  (Hund's Rules) 
 
The shorthand designations in Table 1.1 show these normal or ground state (lowest energy) 
electron configurations for the atoms.  For example, the designation 1s22s1 for Li means that 
there are 2 electrons in its 1s atomic orbital and 1 electron in its 2s atomic orbital.

  Atomic Orbitals.  We can imagine that the 1s, 2s, 3s, and 2p atomic orbitals have the 
three-dimensional shapes that we show here.  [graphic 1.27]  We draw the s atomic orbitals 
as spheres of increasing size, and the 2p atomic orbitals as "dumbbells".  In reality, atomic 
orbitals have no boundaries, and these shapes represent spatial volumes around the atom that 
contain 90 to 95 % of the electron density in each atomic orbital.  We can imagine that the 
three equal energy 2p atomic orbitals lie along mutually perpendicular x, y, and z axes of a 
rectangular coordinate system with the atomic nucleus at the origin so they are commonly 
designated 2px, 2py, and 2pz.  Using these x, y, and z subscripts, the shorthand notation for 
the electron configuration of O is 1s22s22px22py12pz1. 
 

Electrons as Particles or Waves.  Chemists think of electrons both as particles and as waves.  The 
term electron density describes electron distribution in a volume of space when they are thought of as 
waves.  When they are thought of as particles, the atomic orbital shapes shown above represent the 
volumes of space where the electrons are present 90 to 95% of the time.  There are other atomic 
orbitals (e.g., 3d and 4f atomic orbitals) besides those shown here, but they contain no electrons for 
most atoms found in organic molecules. 

Lobes and Nodes.  Each 2p atomic orbital has two lobes that join at a point called a 

 
 
node.  [graphic 1.28]  The electron density is the same in each lobe, but electron density is 
zero at the node.  While 1s atomic orbitals have no nodes, 2s atomic orbitals have one node 
and 3s atomic orbitals have two nodes.  Because the nodes in 2s and 3s atomic orbitals are 
spherical surfaces located within the 90 to 95% spherical boundaries of the atomic orbitals 
shown above, they often do not appear in pictures of these s atomic orbitals.  The single 
spherical node in a 2s atomic orbital is represented by the dotted circle in the cross-section of 
a 2s atomic orbital.  [graphic 1.29]  The shading in this figure shows that most of the electron 
density in the 2s atomic orbital is between the inner nodal sphere and the 90 to 95% spherical 
outer boundary. 
 
Chemical Bonds in Alkanes  (1.2C) 
Like the H-H bond in H2, we can picture C-H and C-C bonds in alkanes as molecular orbitals 
(with electron pairs) that arise from combination of atomic orbitals of C and H atoms.  Let's 
first examine this atomic orbital combination for C-H bonds in CH4 and then look at it for 
other alkanes. 
 
  C-H Bonds in CH4.  Experiments show that methane (CH4) has a three-dimensional 
shape in which the four C-H bonds point away from the C atom toward the four corners of a

tetrahedron.  [graphic 1.30]  As a result, the H-C-H bond angles are all 109.5° and we 
describe the C atom as tetrahedral.   
 
You can imagine formation of the C-H bonds in CH4 from combination of a C with four H 
atoms.  [graphic 1.31]  The H atoms use their 1s atomic orbitals that each contain one 
electron.  [graphic 1.32]  However, to provide the tetrahedral shape of CH4, the atomic 
orbitals of C need to point away from each other with 109.5° angles and must each contain 
an electron.  We do not find four atomic orbitals of this type in the ground state electron 
configuration of C (Table 1.1 and Figure [graphic 1.26]), but we will see in the next section 
that a process called atomic orbital hybridization gives us the four atomic orbitals of the 
correct geometry that we need. 
 
sp3 Hybrid Atomic Orbitals of C.  Combination of the wave functions (equations that 
 
mathematically define atomic orbitals) for the 2s and three 2p atomic orbitals of C provides 
mathematical descriptions of four hybrid atomic orbitals of equal energy directed away from 
C at 109.5° angles.  [graphic 1.33]  We describe these hybrid atomic orbitals as sp3 atomic 
orbitals because each contains one part s and three parts p atomic orbital character.  By 
convention, the "2" of 2s and 2p is not included in the name of the sp3 hybrid atomic orbital.  
Each sp3 atomic orbital has two unequal lobes joined at a node.  [graphic 1.34]  The location 
of the C nucleus is inside the smaller lobe close to the node. 
 
A comparison of the elec tron configurations for a ground state C atom and an sp3 hybridized 
C atom shows that the new hybrid sp3 atomic orbitals are at an energy level intermediate 
between those of the original 2s and 2p atomic orbitals.  [graphic 1.35]  If you use the rules 
outlined earlier to place the six electrons of C in the atomic orbitals of sp3 hybridized C, one 
electron ends up in each of the four sp3 hybrid atomic orbitals.  As a result, all four of these 
sp3 electrons are suitable for C-H bond formation with H atoms. 
 
  C-H and C-C Bonds in Ethane.  Ethane (CH3-CH3) has a three-dimensional shape 
where the H-C-H and H-C-C bond angles are approximately 109.5° like the bond angles in 
methane.  [graphic 1.36]  Since its C's are approximately tetrahedral, we can view the C-C 
bonds as the result of combination of an sp3 atomic orbital on each C.  [graphic 1.37]  We 
then picture each C-H bond as the result of the combination of one of remaining sp3 atomic 
orbitals on each C with a 1s atomic orbital of H.  [graphic 1.38]  Since all C atoms in alkanes 
are approximately tetrahedral, we can use sp3 hybridized C for formation of all of their C-H 
and C-C bonds.

Chapter 1 

Alkane Bond Angles are Not Exactly 109.5°.  We will see in Chapter 2 that bond angles in alkanes 
are not exactly 109.5°.  Bond angles at a tetrahedral C usually differ from this preferred value because 
they adjust to accommodate different size atoms or groups on a C.  Since these deviations from 
tetrahedral bond angles are relatively small we can generally approximate all tetrahedral C's as sp3 
hybridized.  

 
  C-H and C-C Molecular Orbitals.  We designate each C-H bonding molecular orbital in 
alkanes as σ(sp3-1s) while the C-C bonding molecular orbital is σ(sp3-sp3).  [graphic 1.39]  
The atomic orbital names in the parentheses are those that combine to form the molecular 
orbital, and the prefix σ indicates that this combination occurs along the axes of the atomic 
orbitals ("end-on" combination) as we illustrated above for C-C bond formation in ethane.  
(We will see later for other types of compounds that atomic orbitals can also combine with 
their axes parallel to each other.)  
     
Molecular orbitals (MO's) share the characteristics of the two combining atomic orbitals 
(AO's).  As a result, σ(sp3-1s) and σ(sp3-sp3) MO's have different shapes because they arise 
from combination of different AO's.  [graphic 1.40]  A C-H MO has a large lobe containing 
the H nucleus, and a small lobe containing the C nucleus.  H is in the large lobe because it is 
at the center of the 1s AO that overlaps with the large lobe of the sp3 AO of C.  The C 
nucleus lies just inside the smaller lobe of the C-H MO because of its original location in the 
small lobe of the sp3 AO of C.  In contrast, the C-C MO has three lobes and the C nuclei lie 
just inside the two smaller lobes. 
 
Chemical Bonds in Alkenes and Alkynes  (1.2D) 
The three-dimensional shapes of alkenes and alkynes are much different than those of 
alkanes.  In alkenes, the atoms directly attached to the C=C group lie in a plane that includes 
C=C as shown here for ethene.  [graphic 1.41]  In alkynes, the atoms directly attached to the 
C≡C group lie along a straight line that includes C≡C as we see for ethyne.  As a result, H-C-
H and H-C-C bond angles on C=C and C≡C groups are significantly different from the 
tetrahedral bond angles found in alkanes.  In addition, there are just 2 atoms directly attached 
to each C of C≡C, and 3 atoms to each C of C=C, rather than 4 atoms as in alkanes.  These 
observations are not consistent with the use of sp3 hybridized C atoms in C=C and C≡C 
groups.  They require two different hybridization states for C that we describe in the 
following sections. 
 
  Hybridization of C in C=C Bonds.  If we combine just two 2p atomic orbitals of C with 
its 2s AO, the result is an sp2 hybridized carbon atom with three sp2 hybrid atomic orbitals.

[graphic 1.42]  These three sp2 atomic orbitals all lie in the same plane separated from each 
other by 120° angles.  This is a perfect arrangement of atomic orbitals to form C-H and C-C 
bonds in ethene since it is planar and its bond angles are all about 120°!  [graphic 1.43]   
 
However this picture accounts for only one bond between the two C atoms.  What is the 
origin of the second bond in each C=C?  The electron configuration of the sp2 C atom 
provides the answer.  [graphic 1.44]  While each sp2 atomic orbital with its electron 
participates in formation of one C-H or C-C bond, there is an additional electron in the 
unhybridized 2p atomic orbital of the sp2 C.  The second bond between the C's in H2C=CH2 
forms from a sideways combination of these 2p atomic orbitals on each of C.  [graphic 1.45] 
 

More about the sp2 Electron Configuration.  The placement of the sixth electron of sp2 C in the 2p 
atomic orbital (Figure [graphic 1.44]) is inconsistent with our rules that govern the placement of 
electrons in atomic orbitals of the lowest possible energy.  We rationalize this inconsistency by noting 
that sp2 C does not exist by itself outside of a molecule.  As is also the case for sp3 C, the sp2 C has a 
hypothetical electron configuration that we use to explain the formation of MO's by combination of 
AO's.  The same is true for sp hybridized C that we introduce below to explain C≡C bonding. 

 
  C-H and C=C Molecular Orbitals.  Molecular orbitals for C-H bonds in H2C=CH2 are 
σ(sp2-1s), while the C-C MO from overlap of two sp2 hybrid AO's is σ(sp2-sp2).  [graphic 
1.46]  The other C-C molecular orbital resulting from sideways combination of two 2p AO's 
is π(2p-2p).  The symbol π means that the atomic orbitals overlap sideways (with their axes 
parallel) rather than along their axes as for a σ MO.  The π MO, with two lobes located 
above and below the plane of the C and H atoms, is quite different from a σ MO.  As a result, 
we describe a C=C double bond as consisting of one σ bond and one π bond. 
 
  Hybridization of C in C≡C Bonds.  Hybrid atomic orbitals suitable for making bonds 
between a C and two other atoms, as in ethyne (HC≡CH), arise from combination of one 2p 
and the 2s atomic orbital of an unhybridized C. [graphic 1.47]  This atomic orbital 
combination gives two sp hybrid atomic orbitals on C that form a 180° angle with respect to 
each other.  [graphic 1.48]  These sp atomic orbitals participate in formation of the C-H 
bonds and one of the three bonds between the C's in H-C≡C-H.  [graphic 1.49]  The other 
two bonds between the C's form by sideways combination of the two remaining 2p atomic 
orbitals on one sp C with those on the other sp C.  The result is two π(2p-2p) molecular 
orbitals at right angles to each other.  The C≡C triple bond has one σ bond and two π bonds.

Chapter 1 

The Shapes of Molecules (VSEPR)  (1.2E) 
The tetrahedral shapes of C's in alkanes, the planar geometry of C=C in alkenes, and the 
linear geometry of C≡C in alkynes, dictate the hybrid C atomic orbitals we use to form the 
MO's in these compounds.  We know these molecular shapes from experimental studies, but 
we can also use Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion theory (VSEPR) to predict them.  
VSEPR states that molecules prefer to adopt three-dimensional shapes that place their valence 
shell electron pairs as far apart as possible.  Since all valence shell electrons in alkanes, 
alkenes, and alkynes (such as CH4, CH3CH3, CH2=CH2, and CH≡CH) are in chemical 
bonds, the shapes of these molecules are those that maximize separation of their bonds.  
While you might have wondered earlier why methane (CH4) is not planar with 90° 
H-C-H bond angles, such an arrangement places the four C-H bonds closer together than H-
C-H bond angles of 109.5° in tetrahedral CH4.  [graphic 1.51]   
 
In the case of ethene (CH2=CH2), a planar geometry with 120° bond angles places the C-H 
bonds on each C equidistant from each other and from the two bonds in C=C.  [graphic 1.52]  
While the geometry of ethene is planar, the actual H-C-H bond angles are about 117° and the 
H-C=C angles are about 121°.  VSEPR theory rationalizes the difference in these angles from 
120° by recognizing that C=C has two bonding electron pairs (two bonds).  As a result, there 
is more repulsion between the H-C and C=C bonds in H2C=CH2 than between its two C-H 
bonds.  We will see that VSEPR is useful in predicting 3-dimensional shapes of most organic 
molecules. 
 
Bonds between C and N, O, or X  (1.2F) 
We also use sp3, sp2, and sp hybridization states for N, O, or X atoms in organic compounds. 
 
  Carbon-Nitrogen Bonds.  Early in the chapter, we described C-N, C=N, and C≡N bonds.  
[graphic 1.53]  We use the same hybridization states for the C's in these bonds that we used 
for the C's in C-C, C=C, and C≡C bonds.  For example, the C in H3C-NH2 is sp3, C in 
H2C=NH is sp2, and C in a C≡N group is sp hybridized.  The hybridization state of a C 
depends only on whether it has four single bonds (sp3), one double bond and two single 
bonds (sp2), or a triple bond and one single bond (sp).  It does not depend on the specific 
atom to which C is bonded. 
 
In a similar way, we can assign these same hybridization states to N based on whether it has 
only single bonds (sp3), one single and one double bond (sp2), or a triple bond (sp). Each of 
these sp3, sp2, and sp hybrid electron configurations of N are completely consistent with the

Chapter 1 

preference of N for 3 bonds because each has three atomic orbitals with one electron.  
[graphic 1.54] 

 
Why Hybridize N?  You may wonder why we need to hybridize N to explain its 3 chemical bonds.  
Unhybridized N has three 2p AO's, each containing a single electron, that could form the three bonds 
to C in each of these compounds.  This situation is quite different than that for unhybridized C since it 
has only two AO's with one electron available to form chemical bonds while four are needed.  In the 
case of N, we will see below that hybridization explains its bond angles in molecules such as CH3-
NH2 and CH2=NH that are not consistent with 90° angles predicted for bonds made from 2p AO's of 
unhybridized N.       

 
  CH3-NH2 (sp3 N).  We use the three sp3 atomic orbitals of sp3 N that contain single 
electrons to form the three σ bonds to N in CH3-NH2.  [graphic 1.55]  The two electrons in 
the remaining sp3 atomic orbital of N (Figure [graphic 1.54]) constitute its unshared electron 
pair.  The use of sp3 AO's on N as well as on C suggests that bond angles at these atoms 
should be tetrahedral.  Calculations for this compound show that H-C-H angles are xx°, and 
H-C-N angles are yy°.  [xx and yy to be added]  [graphic 1.56]  While these differ from the 
ideal angle of 109.5°, they are close enough to be consistent with sp3 hybridized C.  Their 
differences reflect differences in the size of H and the NH2 group on C. 
 
The  C-N-H angles of 111°, and H-N-H angle of 107° are also consistent with sp3 hybridized 
N.  This result may surprise you since N has only three attached groups, but VSEPR predicts 
it.  The unshared electron pair is one of thefour  valence shell electron pairs of N.  We need 
to maximize its separation from the three bonding electron pairs as well as maximize the 
separations of the bonding electron pairs from each other.  The result is the observed 
pyramidal geometry for N and its attached atoms.  You can see in Figure [graphic 1.57] that 
the unshared electron pair in an sp3 AO is farther from C-N and N-H bonding electron pairs 
than it would be in a 2p atomic orbital on planar (sp2) N.   [graphic 1.57] 
 
  CH2=NH (sp2 N).  sp2 hybridized N has one sp2 atomic orbital with the unshared 
electron pair and two sp2 atomic orbitals with single electrons that form the σ N-H bond and 
the σ bond in C=N.  [graphic 1.58]  The 2p atomic orbital on N with one electron overlaps 
the 2p atomic orbital containing one electron on sp2 hybridized C to form the π bond in C=N.  
The H2C=NH bond angles are similar to predicted values of 120° expected for sp2 C and sp2 
N  and are consistent with VSEPR theory.  [graphic 1.59]

  H-C≡N (sp N).  The sp atomic orbital with a single electron in sp hybridized N forms the 
σ bond in C≡N, and the unshared electron pair on N is in the other sp atomic orbital.  The 
two π bonds in C≡N result from combination of the 2p atomic orbitals on N with those on sp 
C.  [graphic 1.60]  Chemists think of H-C≡N as an inorganic compound, so the simplest 
organic molecule with a C≡N group is CH3-C≡N. 
 
  Carbon-Oxygen Bonds.  We treat bonding between C and O like bonding between C and 
N.  We have seen that O prefers two bonds and forms single or double bonds to C.  [graphic 
1.61]  In each case, the hybridization of a C bonded to O depends on whether it has four 
single bonds (sp3) as in CH3-OH, or two single bonds and a double bond (sp2) as in H2C=O.  
We similarly assign the hybridization state of O based on whether it has two single bonds 
(sp3) as in CH3-O-H, or one double bond (sp2) as in H2C=O.  We compare the electron 
configurations of sp2 and sp3 hybridized O with that of unhybridized O in Figure [graphic 
1.62].  [graphic 1.62]  You can see that the two unshared electron pairs of sp3 hybridized O 
are in sp3 AO's while those of sp2 hybridized O are in sp2 AO's.  Both of these electron 
configurations are consistent with the preference of O for two bonds since each has just two 
atomic orbitals with single electrons.

We show the MO descriptions in Figure [graphic 1.63] of all of the σ and π bonds between C 
and O in these compounds that arise from overlap of their hybrid AO's.  [graphic 1.63]  The 
C-O-H bond angle of about 110° in CH3-O-H is consistent with sp3 hybridization, but we 
cannot fully verify a tetrahedral geometry at O with only two attached atoms.  [graphic 1.64]  
Similarly, with only one atom (C) bonded to O in H2C=O, there is no experimental 
verification that O is sp2 hybridized.   
 
  Carbon-Halogen Bonds.  Halogen atoms form only one bond to C such as that in CH3-F.  
As a result, there is no possibility of using a bond angle at the halogen to choose its 
hybridization state.  Since we can form that single C-F bond using the one 2p AO with one 
electron of unhybridized F, there seems to be no need to hybridize F.  [graphic 1.65]  In spite 
of this, we prefer to think of F as sp3 hybridized in CH3-F.  [graphic 1.66]  One 
rationalization is based on VSEPR.  The sp3 hybridization places both unshared and bonding 
electron pairs of F in sp3 AO's, so all valence shell electron pairs on F have a separation that 
is greater than expected for those of unhybridized F.  Since we cannot test this idea, and also 
for theoretical reasons associated with complete bonding theories, some organic chemists 
prefer to think of F as unhybridized. 
 
The other halogens Cl, Br, and I have more electrons than F, but the unhybridized and sp3 
hybridized electron configurations of their valence shell atomic orbitals are analogous to 
those of F.  As a result, there is an sp3 AO for each halogen that can overlap with an sp3 AO 
of C to form a C-X bond (Table 1.2) [next page], or we can imagine that they form C-X 
bonds using their unhybridized p orbital with one electron. 
 

1.3 Organic Chemistry 

Now that we have examined the major classes of organic compounds, their functional 
groups, and their chemical bonds, let's preview the rest of the course. We can divide organic 
chemistry into the two broad categories of molecular structure and chemical reactions.  
We can further break these broad categories into a number of individual topics that we will 
examine below.  Because the principles of organic chemistry serve as the basis for 
understanding the biochemistry of living systems, we will also discuss topics in bioorganic 
chemistry.

Molecular Structure  (1.3A) 
We have drawn chemical formulas, and three-dimensional structures, for a variety of 
different organic compounds in this chapter.  We have also discussed chemical bonds that 
hold atoms together in these molecules.  However, there is much more to learn about 
molecular structure.  In our exploration of the individual classes of organic compounds, we 
will study their systematic names (nomenclature), and their physical and chemical 
properties such as their acidity and basicity.  We will also consider their three-dimensional 
shapes and other features relating to the arrangements of their atoms in space that we refer to 
as stereochemistry.   
 
We have seen that electrons in chemical bonds bind individual atoms to each other in 
molecules.  The distribution of the electrons in the bonds and molecules depends on the types 
of bonded atoms, whether the bonds are π or σ bonds, and the arrangements of π and σ bonds 
with respect to each other.  We will see that the electron distribution in bonds causes 
molecules and their functional groups to have varying degrees of polar character that

significantly affects their physical properties and chemical reactions.  We will also explore 
instrumental methods that chemists use to determine the structures of organic molecules.   
 
These techniques, generally referred to as organic spectrometry, appear early in this text 
because the determination of molecular structure is vitally important in organic chemistry. 
 
Chemical Reactions  (1.3B) 
Chemical reactions are the core of organic chemistry.  They convert one class of organic 
molecules into another class and permit the synthesis of new molecules from those which 
already exist.   Organic chemical reactions take place by a series of steps in which existing 
chemical bonds break and new chemical bonds form.  During these transformations, the 
molecules undergoing chemical reaction experience changes in their chemical bonds and 
their three-dimensional shapes.  We refer to the details of these changes as the reaction 
mechanisms and we will discuss them in depth for various types of chemical reactions.   
 
The types of mechanisms that characterize organic reactions depend to a significant extent on 
the classes of molecules that are being interconverted.  They also depend on the polarity and 
electron distribution in the molecules undergoing the reaction (the reactants), and those that 
form in the reaction (the products).  For this reason, aspects of molecular structure are of 
crucial importance in understanding the chemical reactivity of organic compounds. 
 
Bioorganic Chemistry  (1.3C)    
If your academic major is in one of the life sciences, you are studying organic chemistry 
because all organisms are complex molecular assemblies made up of a vast number of 
organic molecules.  You will see later in this text that these bioorganic molecules have 
functional groups identical to those described in this chapter.  You will also learn that most 
of the biochemical reactions that occur in organisms are organic reactions with mechanisms 
analogous to those that you will study in this course. 
 
The bioorganic molecules that we will learn about include carbohydrates, proteins, amino 
acids, nucleic acids, and lipids.  You probably already know that carbohydrates are 
important as sources of energy in metabolism and as structural support in plants.  Proteins 
are large molecules, made up of many amino acids, that make up muscle tissue and serve as 
enzymes.  Nucleic acids are not only the molecular repository of our genetic code, but also 
act as the templates and assembly lines for the synthesis of proteins.  Finally, lipids include a 
large collection of structurally diverse bioorganic molecules including fats, waxes, terpenes, 
and steroids.

Chapter 1 

The next chapter in this text begins our exploration of specific topics that we have previewed 
in this chapter.  The amount of detail in that chapter is significant so it is important that you 
attempt to read the chapter before your instructor presents material from it in lecture.  You 
may understand only a little of the chapter before hearing the lectures that cover it, but that 
advance reading will have an enormous impact on your ability to get the full benefit from 
your instructor's lectures.  A second reading after the lectures will hopefully show you that 
you have significantly increased your level of understanding. 
 
The questions included in each chapter will help you determine your level of understanding 
of the material that you have just covered.  Be sure to try them early in your reading.  Don't 
think that two or three readings of a chapter before attempting these questions will make 
them easier.  An early attempt at answering questions will help you focus on the important 
concepts in each chapter. 
 
It is important to do your own work and make your own mistakes.  While it may make you 
more comfortable to check out the answers to the questions in the study guide, or to work on 
them with other students before you try to solve them yourself, it is likely that neither those 
answers nor your study group will be available to you when you take your midterm and final 
exams.  Listening to the explanation of a problem or a concept by another, or reading the 
answer to a question in the text, may make much sense at the time, but it's amazing how 
quickly that clarity vanishes when you are all by yourself with your examination paper.  Be 
sure that you ultimately challenge yourself to show you can close the text and the study guide 
and answer questions on your own that you think you understand. 
 
Many successful students rewrite their lecture notes as soon as possible after a lecture.  You 
might want to try this too.  The process will help you implant the material into your memory 
and it will also show you places in your notes that are unclear and need further explanation or 
clarification from the text or your instructor.  You might try to do this with the material in the 
text as well! 
 
Best wishes to you in your journey through organic chemistry.  It will be difficult and 
challenging.  Along the way you will encounter many new things that you may find 
interesting and perhaps even exciting.  In the end, you will have learned much from your 
excursion.  Bon voyage!
