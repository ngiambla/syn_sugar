Objective:
Isolate the untrusted

3

 One way to provide fault isolation 

among cooperating software 
modules is to place each in its 
own address space.

44

Issues with Software Dependability & Extensions

 User extensions can lead to system crash
 Potential Security Flaw
 Mitigations techniques are costly
User Extensions should be untrusted.

5

Efficient Fault 
Isolation

Thinking in the sandbox.

6

Efficient Fault Isolation

Typical Approach:
Remote Procedure Call (RPC)
 Generate Stub [C]
 Pack Stub [C]
 Send Stub [C]
 Receive Stub [S]
 Unpack Stub [S]
 Process [S]

Issues:
Largely Inefficient
 Network Congestion
 Many Context Switches

7

Efficient Fault Isolation

Other Approaches:
 Address Space Identifier Tags
 Restrictive Programming Languages
 Anonymous RPC

8

 Unfortunately, there is a high 

performance cost to providing 
fault isolation through separate 
address spaces

99

Novel Contributions:

1. Generate a Fault Domain - Logical Separation 

of Address Space

2. Sandboxing
3. Modified Cross-Address RPC
Hopes: Efficient Fault Isolation!

Logically Separating a Process Address 
Space

11

Segment Matching & Sandboxing

Software Encapsulation Techniques:

Split Address into Segments
1. Program and Data have 

different segments

2. Segments are identified 
with Segment Identifiers

Seg  = 0x34df & 0x00ff..
Pseg = Seg | 0x5400..

0x34df..

0x54df..

0x44df..

Software Encapsulation Techniques:

Sandboxing

13

Segment Matching & Sandboxing

Software Encapsulation Techniques:

Segment Matching
 Can Pinpoint Fault
 More efficient than RPC, but 

still costly.

Sandboxing
 Can only identify, no 

pinpointing

 Much More Efficient

Efficient 
Sandboxing

Space-Time Tradeoffs with Segmentations

15

Efficient Sandboxing:

Problem: Sandboxing control flow with REG+OFFSET is 
costly.

Solution: Include Guard 
Zone with Segmentation!

*Their prototype applies loop invariant code motion and 
instruction scheduling optimizations

16

Data-Sharing 

Lazy Pointer Swizzling

17

Sharing Data between Fault Domains

Problem: Sharing Read-Write Data with Other Fault 
Domains 

Solution: Alias Page Tables into Segmented 
Fault Domains! Voila!

*Read only accesses are trivial!

18

Low Latency Cross 
Fault Domain 
Communication 

19

Low Latency RPC for Fault Domains:

1. Use a (READONLY) jump table for control flow instructions
2. Using Specialized Stub (Hand generated)
3. Only Transfer parameters (no marshalling) (Single Copy 

compared to 3)

Works on the principal of trust!

Low Latency RPC for Fault Domains:

21

Implementation & Evaluation

 Implemented with GCC. (Limitations on use cases).
 Benchmarks: C SPEC 92, Sequoia 2000, and some of 

Splash.

 Evaluated Overheads + Novel RPC method
Consensus: 
 The encapsulation overhead was demonstrated to have 

minimal impact on program execution! 

22

Implementation & Evaluation

23

Implementation & Evaluation

Consensus: 
 Software enforced fault isolation is able to reduce the 
relative cost of cross-fault domain RPC by an order of 
magnitude.

Questions...

26

Question 1
What did the authors 
mean when they said they 
could provide 
full-security? Is this true?

Answer
- By isolating untrusted code in a fault 

security 

domain and disallowing jumps 
beyond this, they provide security. 

- However they do not provide full 

27

Question 2
The idea presented here 
has value for software 
design. What could you 
extrapolate from this idea 
in this context?

Answer
- New code could be identified as 

distrusted and put in their own fault 
domain. 

- Then the new code could be safe 
from affecting other parts of some 
system.

28

Question 3
Do you think that this 
approach would benefit 
from 64-bit Addressing?
What if they combined the 
anonymous RPC 
approach?

Answer
- The 64-bit Addressing mode may 
loosen the requirement for Guard 
Zoning

- Although, the randomized approach 

my present issues when Pointer 
Swizzling is used.

29

Question 4
What is Binary Patching? 
Why is Binary Patching 
difficult? Can you think of 
any solution to this 
problem?

Answer
- Compiled High Level Descriptions 

turn into binary representations 
available for interpretation by the 
host. Binary Patching is able to 
sandbox code by modifying the 
literal binary rep. This is difficult as 
binaries are host dependent.

- A solution: utilize LLVM and produce 

an IR?

30

Question 5
Could you apply fault 
isolation techniques to 
determining runtime bugs?

Answer
- By using some variant of 

Segmentation Matching, it may be 
possible to identify runtime bugs 
(upon careful selection)
