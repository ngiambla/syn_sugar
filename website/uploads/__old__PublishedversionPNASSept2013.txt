Chlorophyll (chl) is essential for light capture and is the starting
point that provides the energy for photosynthesis and thus plant
growth. Obviously, for this reason, retention of the green chloro-
phyll pigment is considered a desirable crop trait. However, the
presence of chlorophyll in mature seeds can be an undesirable trait
that can affect seed maturation, seed oil quality, and meal quality.
Occurrence of mature green seeds in oil crops such as canola and
soybean due to unfavorable weather conditions during seed ma-
turity is known to cause severe losses in revenue. One recently
identiﬁed candidate that controls the chlorophyll degradation ma-
chinery is the stay-green gene, SGR1 that was mapped to Mendel’s
I locus responsible for cotyledon color (yellow versus green) in
peas. A defect in SGR1 leads to leaf stay-green phenotypes in
Arabidopsis and rice, but the role of SGR1 in seed degreening
and the signaling machinery that converges on SGR1 have
remained elusive. To decipher the gene regulatory network that
controls degreening in Arabidopsis, we have used an embryo stay-
green mutant to demonstrate that embryo degreening is achieved
by the SGR family and that this whole process is regulated by the
phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) through ABSCISIC ACID INSEN-
SITIVE 3 (ABI3); a B3 domain transcription factor that has a highly
conserved and essential role in seed maturation, conferring desic-
cation tolerance. Misexpression of ABI3 was sufﬁcient to rescue
cold-induced green seed phenotype in Arabidopsis. This ﬁnding
reveals a mechanistic role for ABI3 during seed degreening and
thus targeting of this pathway could provide a solution to the
green seed problem in various oil-seed crops.
freezing tolerance | nondormant
The success of angiosperms impinges on their ability to des-

iccate and protect their embryos in a dormant state until
favorable conditions are perceived. In many angiosperms and oil-
seed plants such as Arabidopsis and canola, this desiccation
process during seed maturation is intricately coupled to loss of
chlorophyll (chl) from photosynthetically active embryos (1).
During the embryo maturation phase, as the embryos begin to
lose their chlorophyll, they concomitantly initiate the process of
acquisition of desiccation tolerance and dormancy, thereby
producing mature, brown (degreened) and dormant seeds. The
persistence of chlorophyll in mature seeds has negative impacts
on seed storability in many commercial plant species such as
canola, cabbage, carrot, geranium, and soybean (2–4). Apart
from contributing to reduced storability, prevalence of green
seeds in mature oil seeds (canola and soybean) is also associated
with reduced shelf life of oil and production of unfavorable odors
and ﬂavors. Particularly, in canola, which is one of the major
global cash crops, the frost-induced green seed problem has been
estimated to result in an annual loss of $150 million in revenue in
North America alone (5, 6).

During seed development, abscisic acid (ABA) is known to
control mid to late stages of embryo maturation and desiccation
tolerance through the B3 domain transcription factor ABSCISIC
ACID INSENSITIVE 3 (ABI3) (7). The severe ABI3 allele,

abi3-6 exhibits pleiotropic effects during seed development that
bypass the embryo maturation phase and transition directly into
the germination and vegetative phases (8). This lack of embryo
maturation phase results in seeds that remain green due to
failure of embryo degreening in the severe abi3 alleles. These
green seeds are nondormant, desiccation intolerant, and display
extreme ABA insensitivity. ABA signaling through SUCROSE
NONFERMENTING 1 (SNF1)-related protein kinases (SnRKs)
is also required for this degreening process as triple SnRK
mutants (snrk d/e/i) harbored mature green seeds that were vi-
viparous and desiccation intolerant, similar to abi3-6 seeds (9).
In peas, Mendel’s I locus, which codes for SGR (stay green)
gene was shown to be responsible for cotyledon color (yellow
versus green) (10, 11). Interestingly, green pea seeds defective in
SGR1 have not been reported to have any longevity problems
compared with their yellow counterpart. Stay-green mutants
resulting from defects in SGR belong to the type C class of
nonfunctional stay-green mutants that proceed normally with the
loss of photosynthesis and senescence process despite the pres-
ence of high levels of chlorophyll (12). In Arabidopsis, there are
two SGR genes, SGR1 (At4g22920) and SGR2 (At4g11910).
Loss-of-function null mutations in the SGR1 did not result in
green embryos, although a stay-green vegetative leaf phenotype
was reported (13, 14). It still remains unexplored whether the
Arabidopsis SGR orthologs participate in the seed degreening
process similar to Mendel’s I locus.

The lack of seed degreening in abi3-6 mutants suggests that
ABI3 should function as a master regulator of seed degreening.
Thus, this genotype is an excellent starting material to un-
derstanding embryo degreening. By analyzing the transcriptional
landscape of maturing abi3-6 seeds, we identiﬁed that the SGR

Signiﬁcance

Occurrence of mature green seeds in oil-seed crops such as
canola and soybean causes severe losses in revenue. Retention
of chlorophyll in seeds can be an undesirable trait as it affects
seed maturation, seed oil, and meal quality. We show that the
abscisic acid (ABA, plant hormone) dependent transcription fac-
tor ABSCISIC ACID INSENSITIVE 3 (ABI3), confers seed degreening
by regulating Mendel’s stay-green genes. This study unveils
a new role for ABI3 in removal of seed chlorophyll in addition to
its functions in embryo maturation and conferring desiccation
tolerance. This pathway could be manipulated to tackle the
cold-induced green seed problem in oil-seed crops.

gene family is under direct transcriptional control of ABI3.
Moreover, we show that SGR2, but not SGR1, mediated embryo-
speciﬁc degreening. Misexpression of SGR genes fully rescues the
stay-green phenotype and partially rescues the ABA insensitivity
of abi3-6 but does not rescue other late embryogenesis defects
such as dessication intolerance and seed storage protein accu-
mulation in this allele. Thus, the pleiotropic phenotypes associ-
ated with ABI3 mutants can be separated into two programs, one
involving defects in degreening and the other involving aberrant
seed maturation.

Results
abi3-6 Is an Embryo Stay-Green Mutant. Although multiple ABI3
alleles have been identiﬁed with various degrees of ABA in-
sensitivity, not all of these alleles display the green seed phenotype
exhibited by the severe alleles of ABI3. To precisely examine the
various stages of degreening during embryo maturation phase, we
tagged ﬂowers from Col-0, abi3-8 (weak abi3 allele), and abi3-6
right after fertilization, followed by harvesting and comparison of
the embryos at various stages postfertilization indicated by days
after ﬂowering/fertilization (DAF). Both Col-0 and abi3-8 displayed
complete embryo degreening at 16 DAF, whereas abi3-6 embryos
still remained green, conﬁrming the previously documented stay-
green embryo phenotype observed only with the severe alleles of
ABI3 (Fig. 1A).

abi3-6 was originally isolated from a fast neutron screen on
inhibiting concentration of ABA (8). Sequencing of the ABI3
transcripts from abi3-6 revealed a premature stop codon caused

by the deletion, leading to abrupt stoppage of the ORF after
amino acid 231 (SI Appendix, Fig. S1A). Thus, ABI3-6 codes for
a truncated, short protein with only the intact A1 domain with-
out the B1, B2, and B3 domains (SI Appendix, Fig. S1A). The
severe abi3-6 phenotype could result from lack of the DNA
binding B3 domain due to the truncation and the inability of
ABI3-6 to localize to the nucleus as observed from transient
expression in tobacco cells (15) (SI Appendix, Fig. S1B). This is in
contrast to the weaker, leaky phenotype and nuclear localization
displayed by point mutations in ABI3 (16) (SI Appendix, Fig. S1
A and B).

Transcriptional Landscape of abi3-6 Embryos Reveals Repression of
Mendel’s I Locus. In Arabidopsis, ABI3 is highly expressed in the
embryo throughout the maturation phase (17) (SI Appendix, Fig.
S1C). We hypothesized that if lack of ABI3 function results in
the embryo stay-green phenotype, then the expression of down-
stream ABI3 targets will be affected and the factors responsible
for embryo-degreening should represent a subset of the targets
regulated by ABA. To examine this, we performed microarray
analyses to identify the transcriptome proﬁle of embryos in their
late maturation phase (13 DAF) when embryos begin to enter
the degreening phase (13–16 DAF) and when ABI3 expression is
maximal (SI Appendix, Fig. S1C). Microarray was performed with
RNA extracted from embryos harvested from siliques at 13 DAF.
From the microarray analyses (http://mapman.gabipd.org/web/
guest/robin) (18), we identiﬁed several groups of genes that were
expressed at least twofold higher or lower in abi3-6 mutant than in

Col-0 (SI Appendix, Fig. S2). Seed storage proteins and late em-
bryogenesis abundant proteins were repressed, whereas genes
related to light reactions and tetrapyrrole synthesis, which are
involved in photosystem organization and chlorophyll biosynthesis,
were induced in abi3-6 (SI Appendix, Table S1). Interestingly,
Mendelian stay-green locus AtNYE1/SGR1 was expressed at a
threefold lower level compared with Col-0 (log2 fold change −1.54)
(SI Appendix, Table S1).

SGR1 and SGR2 Are Up-Regulated During Seed Maturation and
Reduced in abi3-6 Background. Defects in SGR1 lead to stay-
green leaf phenotypes in Arabidopsis and rice and a stay-green
cotyledon phenotype in peas (10). Currently, there is no evidence
to suggest that SGR1 is also responsible for embryo degreening
in Arabidopsis and other related species. In public microarray
databases, AtSGR1 (the only SGR family member represented in
the microarray database) expression in maturing seeds mirrored
ABI3 expression and was up-regulated following increase in
ABI3 expression (SI Appendix, Fig. S1C). Reverse transcription-
quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) was performed to validate the
microarray results and to investigate the changes in expression
patterns of both SGR1 and SGR2 during seed maturation.
During seed maturation in Col-0, expression of both SGR1 and
SGR2 are highly up-regulated between 13 and 16 DAF, with
SGR1 and SGR2 displaying a 10- and 35-fold increase, re-
spectively (Fig. 1B). On 13 DAF, compared with Col-0, both
SGR1 and SGR2 had lower expression in abi3-6 (Fig. 1C). In
abi3-6 seeds, SGR1 levels are 2.4-fold and 6-fold lower than Col-
0 at 13 and 16 DAF, whereas SGR2 levels are lower by 5-fold and
17-fold at 13 and 16 DAF, respectively (Fig. 1C). While these
results validate the microarray ﬁndings, they also indicate a lack
of up-regulation of SGR family members in the absence of
functional ABI3.

B3 DNA Binding Domain of ABI3 Interacts with the RY Cis-Motif of
SGR1 and SGR2 Promoter Sequences. To determine if the down-
regulation of AtSGR1/2 in the abi3-6 embryo is a direct conse-
quence of lack of ABI3-mediated transcriptional activation of
SGR1/2, we analyzed the promoter sequences of both SGR1 and
SGR2 genes. Both promoters possessed the canonical B3 domain
binding RY motif CATGCA with variable ﬂanking nucleotides.
Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) were performed
using puriﬁed recombinant ABI3 B3 domain with labeled RY
sequence motif (27 nt) of SGR1 and SGR2. Coincubation of
ABI3 B3 domain and labeled RY sequences resulted in re-
tardation of the protein–nucleotide complex, indicating binding
of ABI3 B3 domain with RY sequences of SGR1 and SGR2 (Fig.
1D). The binding speciﬁcity was further veriﬁed through addition
of unlabeled RY sequences (10, 100, and 1000×) in the reaction
that resulted in reduction to complete elimination of signal from
the autoradiograph (Fig. 1D).

Ectopic Expression of Either SGR1 or SGR2 Rescues abi3-6 Degreening
Defect. If reduced levels of SGR1/2 transcripts were responsible
for the observed stay-green embryo phenotype of abi3-6 mutant,
then misexpression of SGR in abi3-6 background would restore
the embryo degreening process. To test this hypothesis, we ec-
topically expressed SGR1 and SGR2 under the control of cauli-
ﬂower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S promoter in abi3-6 background.
When T1 transgenic lines were examined, both overexpressions
(abi3-6/35S::SGR1, abi3-6/35S::SGR2) resulted in restoration of
embryo degreening (Fig. 2 A and B), although overexpression of
SGR1 caused pleiotropic shoot phenotypes with typical yellowing
of leaves (SI Appendix, Fig. S3A), as previously reported (13). In
contrast, SGR2 misexpression conferred embryo-speciﬁc degre-
ening phenotype in abi3-6 seeds without any shoot yellowing
phenotype (Fig. 2B and SI Appendix, Fig. S3B). This indicates
a seed-speciﬁc role for SGR2 during embryo degreening.

expression is shown at bottom of A and B. (C) Seed desiccation tolerance
assay. Mature seeds from Col-0, abi3-6, and the abi3-6/35S::SGR over-
expressors (A, B, D, and F–H) were stored for 4 wk followed by stratiﬁcation
and germination on 0.5× MS plates to assess desiccation tolerance.

SGR-Mediated Degreening Is Partially Coupled to ABA Insensitivity
but Not Desiccation Tolerance. Three independent abi3-6/35S::
SGR1, abi3-6/35S::SGR2 overexpressors were further examined to
test if any of the pleiotropic phenotypes associated with the abi3-6
lesion are altered following overexpression of SGR1 or SGR2.
When mature brown seeds from these abi3-6/35S::SGR over-
expressors were collected and stored for 4 wk, they were com-
pletely incapable of germination even after prolonged stratiﬁcation
(Fig. 2C), mimicking the abi3-6 phenotype. This indicates that the
lack of desiccation tolerance in abi3-6 occurs independent of the
degreening process. When protein levels in these seeds were ex-
amined, the various seed storage protein levels in abi3-6/35S::SGR
overexpressors resembled the abi3-6 proﬁle, revealing that the

accumulation of the storage proteins was still defective in these
brown seeds (SI Appendix, Fig. S4A).

To assess if the degreening defect of abi3-6 was associated
with the observed extreme ABA sensitivity, the brown, viable,
predesiccation seeds from the abi3-6/35S::SGR overexpressors
were assessed for their ability to germinate at either 10 or 25 μM
of ABA. At 24-h postplating, the transgenic lines exhibited rel-
atively increased sensitivity to both concentrations of ABA
compared with abi3-6, but at 72-h postplating, almost all of the
seeds had germinated at both concentrations of ABA (SI Ap-
pendix, Fig. S4 B and C). Thus, degreening seems to marginally
inﬂuence ABA sensitivity of seeds.

SGR1 and SGR2 Are Necessary for Seed Degreening in Arabidopsis.
Rescue of the abi3-6 degreening defect through SGR1/2 over-
expression shows that SGR1 and SGR2 are sufﬁcient to drive
degreening in maturing abi3-6 embryos. To prove necessity of
SGR1 and SGR2 in embryo degreening, we analyzed single and
double mutants of SGR1 and SGR2. RT-PCR analysis of seeds at
16 DAF revealed that in sgr1-1 there was reduced expression of
SGR1, whereas sgr2-2 plants had a complete absence of SGR2
transcripts (Fig. 3A). The double mutants (sgr1-1/sgr2-2) mim-
icked the single mutants in SGR1 and SGR2 expression. In-
terestingly, in the single mutants, we observed an increase of
SGR2 in sgr1-1 background and vice versa, suggesting a com-
pensatory increase in the transcript of the other SGR member in
the single mutants (Fig. 3A). When observed for seed degreening
defects at various time points postfertilization, we observed no
difference in seed degreening in the single mutants compared
with Col-0 (Fig. 3B). However, the double mutants clearly dis-
played persistence of chlorophyll at stages when Col-0 and the
single mutants were progressing through the degreening process
(Fig. 3B). This green seed phenotype was maintained at maturity
and also in stored seeds (Fig. 3C). When seeds stored for 4 wk
were assayed for chlorophyll content, the double mutants had
signiﬁcantly high levels of chlorophyll (Fig. 3C). Interestingly, in

contrast to abi3-6 green seeds that were incapable of germinating
after 4 wk of storage, the sgr1-1/sgr2-2 seeds (after 4 wk of
storage) showed 100% germination following stratiﬁcation (Fig.
3D). When assayed for ABA sensitivity, sgr2-2 and sgr1-1/sgr2-2
had signiﬁcantly higher radicle emergence at 2 μM ABA com-
pared with sgr1-1 and Col-0 (Fig. 3D). The ability of green sgr1-1/
sgr2-2 seeds to germinate prompted us to investigate if the seed
storage protein levels are altered in the green seeds. Protein gels
revealed that lack of SGR1 and SGR2 did not affect the ability of
the seeds to accumulate the storage proteins as the single and
double mutants mimicked the Col-0 protein expression pattern,
whereas abi3-6 seeds showed a clear lack of accumulation of
these proteins (SI Appendix, Fig. S5). Thus, SGR1 and SGR2 are
required for embryo degreening during seed maturation and this
degreening process is independent of seed storage protein ac-
cumulation, although degreening seems to promote ABA sen-
sitivity of mature brown seeds.

ABI3 Overexpression Rescues Freezing-Induced Green Seeds in
Arabidopsis. Frost is one of the major factors that can cause ﬁx-
ation of green color in mature seeds. Exposure of maturing canola
plants to sublethal frost of 0 °C to 1 °C can ﬁx the green color in
seeds, resulting in major losses in the canola industry (3, 4). Based
on our identiﬁcation of ABI3 as the master regulator of degreen-
ing, we hypothesized that if freezing resulted in the down-regulation
of chlorophyll degradation pathway, overexpression of ABI3 under
a constitutive promoter should allow circumventing of this problem.
To test this, we investigated whether Arabidopsis can mimic
the frost-induced green seed phenotype observed in canola.
Exposure of maturing Arabidopsis pods at various days after
ﬂowering (11–13 DAF) to freezing temperatures resulted in
mature green seeds (Fig. 4A). When trangenic Arabidopsis lines
overexpressing ABI3 in abi3-6 background (35S::ABI3/abi3-6)
were subjected to a similar treatment, the transgenic seeds pro-
ceeded to degreen to produce mature brown seeds despite the
cold treatment (Fig. 4A). Our RT-qPCR analyses revealed that

the ABI3 overexpressing lines constitutively expressed signiﬁ-
cantly higher levels of ABI3, SGR1, and SGR2 compared with

in maturing seeds when Col-0 plants were exposed to freezing
temperatures and allowed to recover for 1 or 2 d, whereas similar
treatment only had a mild effect on expression of ABI3, SGR1,
and SGR2 in ABI3-OX lines (Fig. 4B).

Discussion
Through using the green seed mutant abi3-6, we have identiﬁed
the genetic regulatory network that controls seed degreening in
Arabidopsis. We have demonstrated that during embryo de-
velopment, ABI3 functions in two independent programs; one
that regulates seed degreening through the SGR family and the
other that is dedicated to seed maturation and desiccation tol-
erance (Fig. 5). Furthermore, our study demonstrates that the
inﬂuence of ABI3 on chlorophyll degradation is seed speciﬁc,
because abi3-6 plants did not display a stay-green leaf phenotype
similar to sgr1-1 when kept under dark conditions (SI Appendix,
Fig. S6). Thus, the transcriptional activation of SGR1/2 by ABI3
forms an exclusive seed-speciﬁc degreening module that is re-
quired for successful embryo degreening.

Interestingly, retention of chlorophyll in seeds has been con-
sidered to be a detriment to the embryo due to the phototoxic
nature of chlorophyll and its catabolites. The sgr1-1/sgr2-2 double
mutants, however, exhibited normal desiccation tolerance, were
able to acquire dormancy, and germinated 100% after storage
(Fig. 3). During senescence or leaf yellowing, loss of chlorophyll
is initiated when chl a and chl b are broken down through the
action of pheophytinase and pheide a oxygenase (PaO) into red

chlorophyll catabolites (19). Lack of PaO is known to result in
light-dependent accelerated cell death phenotypes due to accu-
mulation of catabolites in the chl-degradation pathway that are
phototoxic (20–23). In the leaf, SGR1 functions upstream of PaO
as sgr1 mutants do not accumulate any phototoxic catabolites that
accumulate in pao mutants (14). This model of SGR1 functioning

Embryo degreening is exclusively orchestrated by ABI3. ABI3 controls em-
bryo degreening through regulating transcription of functionally redundant
SGR1 (Mendel’s I locus) and SGR2, which function downstream of ABI3 to
mediate degreening. This degreening process is also partially coupled to
ABA sensitivity. Dashed arrows represent transcriptional regulation. Thin

upstream of PaO would explain the viability of mature sgr1-1/sgr2-2
green seed phenotype. By contrast, ABA sensitivity in both
abi3-6/SGR overexpressors and sgr1-1/sgr2-2 double mutants sug-
gested the presence of chl could inﬂuence sensitivity of seeds to
ABA. abi3-6/35S::SGR overexpressors, other than rescuing the
green seed phenotype, also reduced the ABA insensitivity of abi3-6
(Fig. 2). In contrast, in sgr1-1/sgr2-2 mutants, lack of SGR1 and
SGR2 resulted in marginal ABA insensitivity (Fig. 3). The grs
enhancer mutation that results in green seeds in the weak abi3-1
background did not alter ABA insensitivity of abi3-1, but these
seeds were affected in their longevity (2) unlike the sgr1-1/sgr2-2
mutants. Whether the grs/abi3-1 mutant accumulates phototoxic
chl catabolites that affect seed longevity or the mechanism behind
how grs mutation enhances abi3-1 phenotype are not known.
The chloroplast localized, ABA binding, Mg-chelatase H sub-
unit, CHLH, has been shown to participate in ABA responses
independent of chlorophyll biosynthesis (24). Overexpression
of CHLH resulted in increased sensitivity to ABA, without
altering chlorophyll levels (24), whereas the chl-deﬁcient chlh
(cch) mutant was insensitive to ABA (24). Thus, proteins in-
volved in chl biosynthesis (CHLH) or degradation (SGR) could
also inﬂuence ABA responses, although the insensitivity dis-
played is quite weak compared with strong ABA insensitive mutants
such as abi3-6.

Misexpression of ABI3 was sufﬁcient to rescue the cold-in-
duced green seeds in Arabidopsis (Fig. 4). There is precedence
for overexpression of ABI3 conferring freezing tolerance to
plants (25). These studies, which only focused on vegetative
tissues, found overexpression of ABI3 resulted in increased ABA
sensitivity of Arabidopsis leaves and accumulation of ABA-
dependent, ABI3-regulated transcripts such as RAB18 (25–27). In
our study, we found ABI3 overexpressors, accumulated RAB18 as
well as increased levels of SGR1 and SGR2 (SI Appendix, Fig. S7).
One possibility is that the misexpression of ABI3 results in in-
creased sensitivity of these lines to endogenous ABA, which in
turn leads to priming for freezing and desiccation tolerance within
the seed. Alternatively, the increased expression of ABI3 may
directly alter ABI3-dependent transcripts required for chloro-
phyll degradation (SGR1 and SGR2) and freezing/desiccation
tolerance (RAB18) (Fig. 4B and SI Appendix, Fig. S7). This ABI3-
dependent priming allows these seeds to withstand the freezing
treatment and continue to degreen to produce mature brown
seeds. Of course, these two models are not mutually exclusive
and both ABA sensitivity and ABI3 may be required for the seed
priming and freezing tolerance. Whatever the case, in either an
ABA or ABI3 centric model, the lack of basal accumulation of
these transcripts in wild-type seeds results in a freezing-sensitive
system that is defective in the chlorophyll degradation process
following cold treatment. Given that green seed problem is
a major industry concern in oil-seed crops such as canola (3, 4),
our identiﬁcation of ABI3 as the master regulator of this path-
way should allow development of strategies to exploit
this
pathway to tackle the green seed problem. Isolation of the canola
ABI3 ortholog and overexpression of BnABI3 through either a
constitutive promoter or a seed-speciﬁc cold-inducible promoter
could provide a viable solution to the green seed problem asso-
ciated with oil seeds.

Nevertheless, through using the abi3-6 embryo stay-green
mutant, we have identiﬁed that during embryo maturation, ABI3
functions as the master regulator of degreening through transcrip-
tional control of SGR1 and SGR2 (Fig. 5). This ABI3-mediated
degreening process is independent of acquisition of desiccation
tolerance and is partially coupled to ABA sensitivity.

Columbia, respectively (16). Single transfer DNA (T-DNA) insertional mutants of
SGR1 (At4G22920, SALK_070891, sgr1-1) and SGR2 (AT4G11910, SALK_003830,
sgr2-2) were obtained from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center and
genotyped through PCR to isolate homozygous lines. These lines were crossed
and F2 generation was genotyped to isolate the sgr1-1/sgr2-2 double mutants.
Plant media and growth conditions were done as previously described (28). Sil-
iques were staged for phenotypic analysis of whole embryos and for microarray
analysis by tying colored thread around the pedicel on the day of ﬂower
opening. Intact siliques were harvested on the indicated number of DAF and
seeds were observed for degreening or excised with a needle and used for RNA
extraction and microarray analysis.

Plant Transformation for Complementation of the abi3-6 Mutant. A. thaliana
AtSGR1, At4g22920, AY850161, and AtSGR2, At4g11910, AY699948 were
cloned into the pGEM-T vector (Promega). The excised DNA fragments were
cloned into the T-DNA binary vector pCAMter (2X35S::cDNA). The various
constructs carrying SGR1 or SGR2 cDNAs were introduced into Agrobacterium
tumefaciens GV3101 by electroporation and used for ﬂoral dip transformation
(29) of abi3-6 mutant plants. Harvested seeds were spread on MS medium
containing kanamycin for selection of transgenic plants.

Transient Expression Using BY-2 Cells. Biolistic bombardments of cultured
tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) BY-2 cells were performed essentially as de-
scribed previously (30). The full-length ABI3 cDNA (At3g24650), ABI3-6, and
ABI3-8 cDNAs were cloned into the expression vector pRTL2 under the
control of a CaMV 35S promoter for expression as GFP-tagged proteins.
These constructs were bombarded into BY-2 cells. Cells were ﬁxed with
4% (wt/vol) paraformaldehyde and visualized directly through ﬂuorescent
microscopy for detecting GFP.

Microarray Analysis. Seeds from wild-type Col-0 and abi3-6 were excised from
siliques at 13 DAF. Total RNA was extracted and triplicate microarray analysis
using independent seed batches was performed. For each sample analyzed,
5 μg of total RNA was converted to biotin-labeled cRNA using oligo(dT)
priming as described by the manufacturer (Enzo kit; Affymetrix) and hy-
bridized to 22K ATH1 Affymetrix microarrays at the Affymetrix Genechip
facility (University of Toronto). Microarray data were statistically analyzed
with the ﬂexible user friendly graphical
interface ROBIN (http://mapman.
gabipd.org/web/guest/robin) to generate log-fold change of differential gene
expression. Fold changes of signiﬁcantly differentially expressed genes (P <
0.01) were analyzed with the pathway analysis program MapMan (18) (https://
gabi.rzpd.de/projects/MapMan/) to map large datasets into diagrams and
processes. A color code is used to symbolize the fold change of differential
gene expression, where blue indicates higher expression, red indicates lower
expression, and white indicates no change in abi3-6 mutant embryos (SI Ap-
pendix, Fig. S2).

Reverse Transcription Quantitative PCR. Total RNA from seeds was prepared
using RNAqueous columns with the Plant RNA isolation aid (Ambion)
according to manufacturer instructions. Total RNA samples were quantiﬁed
using a NanoDrop Spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies). RNA was
additionally analyzed by gel electrophoresis to conﬁrm integrity. RT reactions
were performed using SuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) fol-
lowing the manufacturer’s directions with 2 μg total RNA input. Quantitative
PCRs (qPCRs) were performed using a Chromo 4 real-time PCR detector
(Bio-Rad) controlled by Opticon Monitor 3 software. Standard curves were
generated using ﬁve concentrations in triplicate in a dilution series, followed
by the test sample run with three biological samples (each analyzed with
triplicate technical replicates). qPCR results were quantiﬁed by the Pfafﬂ
method as described in the real-time PCR applications guide (Bio-Rad). The
Col-0 samples were used as calibrators. The target genes were normalized
against the reference genes β-tubulin (TUB4) or ubiquitin 10 (UBQ10). Sta-
bility of four reference genes (TUB4, UBQ10, ACT2, and GAPDA) was ana-
lyzed under the various conditions used in this study using the BestKeeper
program (31) to identify the most stable reference genes. In developing seeds
(13 DAF and 16 DAF), TUB4 expression was highly stable in both Col-0 and
abi3-6 genotypes (SI Appendix, Table S2 and Fig. S8). UBQ10 was used as the
reference gene for cold-treated samples because it was the most stable
reference gene following cold treatments (SI Appendix, Table S3 and Fig.
S9). Primers used in this study are listed in SI Appendix, Table S4.

Materials and Methods
Plant Materials and Growth Conditions. Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Col-0 was
used as the wild type in this study. abi3-6 and abi3-8 mutant lines were iso-
lated from fast neutron- and EMS-mutagenized M2 populations of ecotype

Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays. Mobility shift assays were performed as
described previously (32, 33). The sequences of all of the oligonucleotides are
shown in Fig. 1D. Both strands of the oligonucleotides were synthesized and
annealed. DNA probes were generated by ﬁlling in 5′ overhangs with the

Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I (Promega) in the presence of [α-32P]
dATP and puriﬁed using MicroSpin columns (GE Healthcare). Double-
stranded DNA with nonradioactive nucleotides were used as competitor DNA.
For the gel shift assays either ∼200 pmol of the labeled probe or various
concentrations of unlabeled probe along with the labeled probe were in-
cubated with 50 ng of puriﬁed recombinant ABI3-B3 DNA binding domain in
2× reaction buffer [12 mM Hepes, 1 mM MgCl2, 4 mM Tris, pH 7.9, 100 mM KCl,
0.6 mM DTT, and 12% glycerol (vol/vol)]. The samples were incubated for 30
min at room temperature and separated by 5% nondenaturing gel (0.5× TBE
buffer) at 4 °C. Following electrophoresis, the gel was dried and subjected
to autoradiography.

ABA Sensitivity Assays. ABA was dissolved in ethanol and added to the media
after sterilization. Mature seeds from Col-0, abi 3–6, and abi3-6/SGR over-
expressors were harvested and tested for ABA sensitivity (germination
scored as radicle emergence) without stratiﬁcation. Seeds were tested for
germination on half strength Murashige and Skoog (MS) media (without
sucrose supplement), in the presence of 10 μM or 25 μM ABA at room
temperature. The double sgr1-1/sgr2-2 mutant seeds were analyzed for ABA
sensitivity along with the respective single mutants and Col-0 on half
strength MS media (without sucrose supplement) with 2 μM and 10 μM ABA.
Values are means ± SEM of three biological replicates.

Seed Protein Analysis. Seed protein was extracted by grinding mature seeds in
an ice-cold mortar with 20 μL·mg−1 seed of extraction buffer [100 mM
Tris·HCI, pH 8.0, 0.5% SDS, 10% glycerol (vol/vol) and 2% (vol/vol) β-mer-
captoethanol]. Extracts were boiled for 3 min and centrifuged. Equal
amounts of proteins were resolved by SDS/PAGE using a 10% gel. Proteins
were visualized by Coomassie blue staining.

Cold-Induced Degreening Assays with Arabidopsis. Flowers from Arabidopsis
plants (Col-0 and 35S::ABI3/abi3-6) were tagged on the day of ﬂower
opening to indicate the day of fertilization/ﬂowering. At various days after
ﬂowering (11, 12, and 13 DAF), these plants were subjected to freezing (−5 °C
to −10 °C) for 2 h for 1, 2, or 3 d and returned to normal growth conditions.
The plants were also subjected to a day of acclimatization at 4 °C before and
after the treatment. Following treatment, plants were allowed to recover for 1
or 2 d at ambient temperature before seeds were collected for either RNA
extraction or allowed to mature and then observed for defects in degreening.
