Electric vehicles represent an innovation with the potential to lower greenhouse gas emissions and help
mitigate the causes of climate change. However, externalities including the appropriability of knowledge
and pollution abatement result in societal/economic beneﬁts that are not incorporated in electric vehicle
prices. In order to address resulting market failures, governments have employed a number of policies.
We seek to determine the relationship of one such policy instrument (consumer ﬁnancial incentives) to
electric vehicle adoption. Based on existing literature, we identiﬁed several additional socio-economic
factors that are expected to be inﬂuential in determining electric vehicle adoption rates. Using multiple
linear regression analysis, we examined the relationship between those variables and 30 national electric
vehicle market shares for the year 2012. The model found ﬁnancial incentives, charging infrastructure,
and local presence of production facilities to be signiﬁcant and positively correlated to a country's electric
vehicle market share. Results suggest that of those factors, charging infrastructure was most strongly
related to electric vehicle adoption. However, descriptive analysis suggests that neither ﬁnancial
incentives nor charging infrastructure ensure high electric vehicle adoption rates.

1. Introduction
The IPCC (2012) noted that climate change caused by rising
levels of greenhouse gases (GHGs) poses a serious threat to the
physical and economic livelihoods of individuals around the globe
and could negatively affect ecosystems by putting 20–30% of plant
and animal species at an increasingly high risk of extinction.1
GHGs such as CO2 and N2O primarily come from the burning of
fossil fuels during activities including electricity production and
operating internal combustion engines. In 2010, the transport

sector accounted for 6.7 Gt of emitted CO2 or 22% of the world's
total (IEA, 2012a). Furthermore, global fuel demand for transportation is projected to grow approximately 40% by 2035 (IEA,
2012b). The IPCC noted the need to reduce GHG emissions
(particularly in the energy and transport sectors) in order to avoid
a 2.4–6.4 1C increase in 2090 temperatures relative to those from
1990 (IPCC, 2012).
Electric vehicles (EVs) are one possible innovation to help
address the environmental concerns identiﬁed above. However,
EV adoption is seen as being very limited without stimulation
from external factors such as stringent emissions regulations,
rising fuel prices, or ﬁnancial incentives (Eppstein et al., 2011;
Shaﬁei et al., 2012; IEA, 2013). Of those factors, consumer subsidies
are speciﬁcally identiﬁed as being necessary for EVs to reach a
mass market (Hidrue et al., 2011; Eppstein et al., 2011). Part of the

reason that diffusion is expected to be so slow is that pollution
abatement and knowledge appropriability2 externalities reduce EV
development and consumer adoption, leading to an inefﬁcient
allocation of goods and services known as a market failure
(Rennings, 2000; Jaffe et al., 2005; Struben and Sterman, 2008).
In the case of EVs, market failures distort their prices relative to
ICEVs, which results in fewer electric automobiles being built by
ﬁrms or bought by consumers. Consequently, the potential to
address climate change through EV development and use is
limited by externalities; neo-classical economics indicates that
government policy should be employed to help correct for such
situations (Rennings, 2000). Of these policy measures, demand
side instruments such as consumer subsidies are viewed as being
particularly important during the early commercialization period
(IEA, 2013). However, based on previous studies, there are reasons
to question how effective such ﬁnancial incentives would be in
encouraging EV adoption.
Firstly, the literature has presented conﬂicting results regarding
the effect of consumer subsidies on hybrid-electric vehicle (HEV)
adoption. While some studies have shown ﬁnancial incentives to
be positively correlated to HEV sales (Beresteanu and Li, 2011;
Gallagher and Muehlegger, 2011), Diamond (2009) found that
higher fuel prices, not consumer subsidies, were related to
increased adoption. In addition, Zhang et al. (2013) identiﬁed only
a very weak relationship between purchase subsidies and consumer willingness to buy EVs. Thus, factors other than ﬁnancial
incentives could be the primary drivers of EV adoption.
Secondly, due to the nature of radical innovation development
(Tushman and Anderson, 1986), there may be reasons to suspect
that consumers may not behave in the same fashion toward HEVs
as they do toward EVs. Innovations that are further away technologically from the dominant design are associated with greater
levels of uncertainty (Anderson and Tushman, 1990). Consequently, since EVs represent a more radical technological departure from ICEVs than do HEVs (Sierzchula et al., 2012), they result
in increased levels of uncertainty, speciﬁcally among consumers
(Sovacool and Hirsh, 2009). This uncertainty affects a broad array
of industrial dynamics including future proﬁtability of a technology, government involvement, and willingness to pay (Arrow,
1966; Nelson and Winter, 1977; Jaffe et al., 2005); the more an
innovation differs from the conventional technology, the less
consumers are willing to pay for it. Thus, higher consumer
uncertainty regarding EVs decreases the amount that individuals
are willing to pay relative to HEVs, in effect reducing the utility of
ﬁnancial incentives relative to EV adoption. This makes it difﬁcult
to estimate the impacts of ﬁnancial incentives on the adoption of a
radical innovation with signiﬁcantly different performance characteristics relative to the conventional technology, as is the case
with EVs. Therefore, earlier studies analyzing HEV adoption may
under-represent the impact that ﬁnancial incentives have on EV
purchases.
In addition, consumer subsidies may have little effect on EV
sales uptake if buyers are uncomfortable with the technology
(Egbue and Long, 2012), or do not see enough EVs in the ﬂeet
around them (a threshold effect) (Eppstein et al., 2011). Our paper
aims to contribute to the literature by examining if and to what
extent ﬁnancial incentives and other socio-economic factors
explain EV adoption.

Knowledge appropriability or “knowledge spillover” relates to the ability of a
ﬁrm to beneﬁt from technologies or expertise that it develops as opposed to other
companies gaining from those advances without investing in the necessary R&D, e.
g., reverse engineering a developed product. Knowledge spillover results in lower
rates of innovation.

2. Barriers limiting innovation
The literature has identiﬁed several obstacles which limit the
diffusion of new technologies such as EVs. For example, knowledge spillover applies broadly to all innovations while pollution
abatement and bounded rationality3 are typically associated with
limiting the development and adoption of environmental technologies (eco-innovations) (Jaffe et al., 2005; Rennings, 2000). These
barriers, which limit EV diffusion by inﬂuencing both the manufacturers that produce the automobiles and the consumers that
buy them, are described more comprehensively below.

2.1. General barriers
In studying the development of innovations, Arrow (1962)
determined that in a capitalist system, ﬁrms will underinvest in
research and development of new technologies. This is primarily
due to uncertainty, but also because an innovation's public beneﬁt
(for which businesses receive little ﬁnancial compensation) often
outweighs its private value to the company. The externality, of
“positive knowledge spillover”, occurs when innovations provide
valuable information to non-consumers (Horbach, 2008).
For example, ﬁrms are not always able to prevent competitors
from gaining from their R&D efforts. The degree to which a ﬁrm is
able to defend the proﬁts of an innovation from competitor
imitation is referred to as its appropriability (Teece, 1986). Because
it is not possible for a ﬁrm to keep every element of a new
technology secret, other companies can gain by learning from and
in some cases stealing the work of the original innovating entity.
Thus, due to knowledge spillovers, businesses are less likely to
invest in the development of innovations that are easily copied
(having low levels of appropriability) because they will not be able
to reap all of the rewards from a successful new technology (Teece,
1986). Positive knowledge spillover inﬂuences the industrial landscape such that although ﬁrms do invest in the research and
development of new technologies, they do so at a lower level than
would be expected based on the ﬁnancial beneﬁts that innovations
provide.
In addition, emerging technologies face further barriers
because they often compare poorly to existing dominant designs
in important criteria such as price and performance (Adner, 2002).
For that reason, the ﬁrst individuals to adopt an emerging radical
innovation are often willing to pay a premium or cope with subpar performance in order to have the latest technology (Rogers,
1995). The larger proportion of the population known as early/late
majority adopters are much more risk adverse, and are not willing
to purchase an innovation so different from the dominant design
(Rogers, 1995). It is vital for radical technologies to attract a
signiﬁcant enough number of early adopters to develop a viable
market niche (Geels, 2002). Thereafter, industrial forces such as
learning by doing and scale economies can rapidly lower costs and
improve performance (Foster, 1986; Christensen, 1997). In order
for an innovation such as electric vehicles to have a signiﬁcant
environmental impact, it needs to be widely adopted (and have
dramatically lower emissions levels compared to ICEVs). For that
to happen, there must ﬁrst be enough demand within the EV niche
market that manufacturers continue to develop and sell the
automobiles. Consequently, governments have employed ﬁnancial
incentives to help attract early EV adopters.

2.2. Barriers that reduce eco-innovation
Eco-innovations differ from other new products and services in
that they provide a lower environmental impact than the conventional technology (Rennings, 2000). Examples range from incremental improvements to existing designs such as turbocharging in
automobile engines to more radical technologies, like solar cells
and wind turbines. The distinct nature of eco-innovations
improves general social utility through lower pollution abatement
levels. However, this externality also creates market failure, and
ultimately limits their development and adoption (Jaffe et al.,
2005).
Investments in eco-innovation are speciﬁcally disincentivized
because beneﬁts from lower pollution levels are not included in a
product's price. The externality pollution functions such that that
even though many societal members proﬁt from eco-innovations
through improved health (however marginally), ﬁrms are not able to
charge those individuals for their gains. As a result, eco-innovations
have lower adoption levels than if societal beneﬁts from decreased
pollution were included in product costs (Brown, 2001).
An additional barrier that has contributed to lower ecoinnovation diffusion is bounded rationality, which can inﬂuence
consumer valuation of a product's purchase price, operating
expenses, and lifetime cost. Instead of using rational choices to
maximize an individual's utility, individuals are aware of only a
portion of the available options and thus act on imperfect
information (Nelson and Winter, 1982). Thus, in place of calculating out the total cost of ownership of a product, consumers often
rely on heuristics or rules of thumb to guide their purchasing
behavior (Jaffe and Stavins, 1994; Schleich, 2009). This can lead an
individual to place too much emphasis on the purchase price and
not accurately value operating expenses (Levine et al., 1995).
Because many eco-innovations have high purchase prices and
low operating expenses, they have often experienced slow diffusion rates (Brown, 2001). Speciﬁcally regarding EVs, consumers
looking to purchase alternative fuel vehicles do not accurately
incorporate fuel economy in their vehicle purchase decisions,
leading to irrational behavior (Turrentine and Kurani, 2007).

3. Factors inﬂuencing EV adoption
Because EVs were introduced to the broader consumer market
only recently in 2010 (not including their temporary commercialization in the 1990s), there is little research that uses empirical
data to analyze factors which affect adoption rates. Thus, much of
our knowledge about such contributing elements comes from
stated preference studies. However, because of a phenomenon
known as the “attitude–action gap”, there is the concern that
information from consumer surveys may have little relation to the
purchase of low-emission vehicles (Lane and Potter, 2007). This
raises the value of research that analyzes actual consumer actions
(revealed preferences), such as that performed in our paper.
HEVs provide a good comparison basis for EVs (even though
they are less of a radical innovation) because they have several of
the same key elements including a battery and electric motor
based powertrain and lower environmental impacts. As HEVs have
been commercially available since the late 1990s, there are several
studies that used revealed preference data to investigate factors
that inﬂuenced consumer uptake for those automobiles. In the
absence of similar research for EVs, we have incorporated in our
model variables that were found to be signiﬁcant drivers of HEV
adoption in those articles e.g., education level, fuel price, and
environmentalism (Lane and Potter, 2007; Diamond, 2009;
Gallagher and Muehlegger, 2011). Based on the ﬁndings in HEV
revealed preference research, EV survey studies, and theoretical

185

articles, we have collected and categorized the factors that are
assumed to determine the decision of whether or not to purchase
an electric vehicle as belonging to the technology itself, the
consumer, or the context.
The technology category comprises aspects of electric vehicles
including battery costs and performance characteristics (driving
range and charging time). EV purchase prices, which are heavily
dependent on battery costs, have been identiﬁed as being the most
signiﬁcant obstacle to widespread EV diffusion (Brownstone et al.,
2000). The IEA (2011) found that the purchase price of an EV with a
30 kWh battery (approx. 85 miles4 of driving range at 0.17 kWh/mile)
would be $10,000 (all ﬁnancial amounts in this article should be read
as US dollars) more than a comparable ICEV. Battery costs also have
an impact on the driving range of an EV. An increase in the size of an
EV's battery (in kWh) raises both its driving range and purchase cost.
Therefore, although consumers are sensitive to a limited driving
range (Lieven et al., 2011) that aspect must be balanced with its
relation to vehicle battery costs. An additional factor which inﬂuences consumer adoption is vehicle charging time (Hidrue et al.,
2011; Neubauer et al., 2012). Whereas most ICEVs are able to refuel in
roughly 4 min, EVs require  30 min at a fast charging station and up
to several (410) h for charging from a 110 or 220 V outlet,
dependent on battery size (Saxton, 2013). Relative to a comparable
ICEV, an EV's high purchase price, limited driving range, and long
charge period all have a negative impact on adoption rate.
In addition to factors relating to the EV, consumer characteristics
also play a role in determining uptake. Studies have identiﬁed levels of
education, income, and environmentalism to all be positively correlated to likelihood to purchase an EV (Hidrue et al., 2011) or HEV
(Gallagher and Muehlegger, 2011). However, these factors, speciﬁcally
environmentalism, are often less important to consumers than vehicle
cost and performance attributes such as those identiﬁed in the
paragraph above (Lane and Potter, 2007; Egbue and Long, 2012).
A third set of elements, which the literature has found to
inﬂuence adoption rates and is external to both the vehicle and
consumer, is categorized as context factors in our research. In several
studies, fuel (gasoline or diesel) prices have been identiﬁed as one of
the most powerful predictors of HEV adoption (Diamond, 2009;
Beresteanu and Li, 2011; Gallagher and Muehlegger, 2011), and have
also been inﬂuential in agent-based models forecasting EV diffusion
(Eppstein et al., 2011; Shaﬁei et al., 2012). Related to fuel prices,
although less commonly incorporated in analyses, are electricity
costs. Those two factors combine to determine a majority of EV
operating expenses which in turn have an impact on adoption rates
(Zubaryeva et al., 2012; Dijk et al., 2013). Other studies have
identiﬁed availability of charging stations as an important determinant in consumer acceptance of alternative fuel vehicles e.g., EVs
(Yeh, 2007; Struben and Sterman, 2008; Egbue and Long, 2012; Tran
et al., 2012). A country's level of urban density could facilitate greater
EV adoption as shorter average travel distances might allow for wider
use of the vehicles' limited driving range (IEA, 2011). Finally, there are
several factors speciﬁc to EVs that could inﬂuence adoption rates
including vehicle diversity i.e., the number of models that consumers
can buy (Van den Bergh et al., 2006), local involvement i.e., the
presence of a local manufacturing plant (IEA, 2013), and public
visibility i.e., the number of years EVs have been available for
purchase (Eppstein et al., 2011).

A charging station with multiple outlets would be counted as one in these ﬁgures.
For many countries, national charging maps were found to provide more comprehensive data than international websites such as www.chargemap.com.
There is no concern of reverse causality between EV adoption rate and the EPI because the low numbers of electric vehicles being driven in countries would have a
negligible impact on the indicators which make up the EPI.

Section 4.1 describes the data that were collected. Section 4.2
outlines a more detailed description of how ﬁnancial incentives
were operationalized. Section 4.3 provides the ﬁnal model
speciﬁcation.
4.1. Data collection
We collected and analyzed data from 30 countries for 2012. The
year 2012 was selected as the study date because important
information such as charging infrastructure and EV adoption rates
were unavailable in earlier years. Our statistical analysis used data
from the following countries: Australia; Austria; Belgium; Canada;
China; Croatia; the Czech Republic; Denmark; Estonia; Finland;
France; Greece; Germany; Iceland; Ireland; Israel; Italy; Japan; the
Netherlands; New Zealand; Norway; Poland; Portugal; Slovenia;
Spain; Sweden; Switzerland; Turkey; the United Kingdom, and the
United States. We selected these countries because of the availability of data, speciﬁcally EV adoption and charging infrastructure
ﬁgures. In our study, we deﬁned electric vehicles as including both
pure battery electric vehicles, e.g., Nissan LEAF, as well as plug-in
hybrid electric vehicles, e.g., Chevy Volt. As this deﬁnition of EVs
was based around vehicles with a plug, other HEV models such as
the Toyota Prius were not included in our analysis.
Based on the factors identiﬁed in Section 3, we collected data
for the following variables for each country in our study: EV
market share, ﬁnancial incentives, urban density, education level,
an environmentalism indicator, fuel price, EV price, presence of
production facilities, per capita vehicles, model availability, introduction date, charging infrastructure,5 and electricity price. EV
adoption was operationalized as national market shares of electric
vehicles. Variable descriptions and their sources are provided in
5
Charging stations were identiﬁed such that there could be multiple stations
at a location, and multiple charging points (plugs) per station.

Table 1. Notable absences include driving range and charging time.
Those variables were not added to our model because generally
the same electric vehicles were available for purchase in the
countries in our sample. Thus, there is no fundamental difference
in the driving range of a Nissan LEAF in China or a Nissan LEAF in
Germany.6
4.2. Financial incentives
To encourage EV adoption, countries have used ﬁnancial
incentives from both technology speciﬁc policies, such as subsidies
to EV consumers, and technology neutral policies, such as
emissions-based vehicle taxes. These were applied either at the
time of a vehicle's registration or on its annual circulation fee
(license fees in the US). In some cases, countries lowered automobile taxes for EVs, and in others they provided subsidies apart
from normal registration and circulation fees, thus presenting a
very diverse ﬁnancial incentive landscape. This section of the
study describes how such a heterogeneous environment for
subsidies was operationalized to allow for analysis across
countries.
In order to compare ﬁnancial incentives that used different
emissions and monetary units, policies were standardized
relative to CO2 emissions and 2012 US dollars. To convert fuel
use to CO2 emissions, we used the following formula: 1 l/100 km ¼
23.2 g CO2/km (UNEP, 2012). We converted currencies to US
dollars using the averaged quarterly exchange rates from 2012.
In some situations, it was necessary to use a vehicle's performance
6
Differences in temperature would affect driving range. With that in mind, the
same vehicle in different countries might have slightly different performance
characteristics depending on weather conditions. However, the precise effects of
temperature on EV driving radii are still being determined. For that reason driving
range as inﬂuenced by temperature was not included in our model, but could still
contribute to differences in adoption between countries such as Spain and Sweden.

This section includes a correlation matrix of variables used in
the model, a descriptive analysis of EV-speciﬁc factors, and results
from the statistical model identiﬁed above. Stress tests of the
model were employed to determine its general robustness and the
relative impact of speciﬁc variables. Finally, we discuss implications that arise from the results, which provide a notion of how
different policy measures such as fuel taxes, consumer subsidies,
and installing charging stations could inﬂuence EV adoption.

characteristics, e.g., CO2 emissions7 in order to calculate the
ﬁnancial incentives of a particular policy. An example would be
an annual circulation fee in which the amount paid was dependent
on a vehicle's CO2 emissions levels. However, this does not give an
indication of the savings relative to the purchase of an ICE vehicle
(there is no basis for comparison). In order to calculate the value of
such ﬁnancial incentive policies, we used information from an
ICEV and EV (a 2012 Volkswagen Golf and Nissan Leaf respectively). Table 2 provides a description of the basic characteristics of
these vehicles.
Some policies, such as registration taxes, were applied on a
one-time basis. For other policies that required annual payments
e.g., circulation fees, we sought to provide a more realistic notion
of their monetary value. We did this by using a 3 year payback
period and consumer discount rate of 30% (based on the work of
Greene et al., 2005; Yeh, 2007). For example, a one-time registration subsidy of $1000 maintains that value, but an annual circulation subsidy of $50 provided a ﬁnancial incentive of $90.81 in our
analysis.
For the countries studied in our sample, ﬁnancial incentives did
not change considerably in 2011 and 2012. In absolute terms
during those 2 years, Portugal saw a $5500 decrease in ﬁnancial
incentives offered to EV adopters while Finland saw a $4600
increase. Otherwise, national ﬁnancial incentive levels have
remained constant over that time period.

4.3. OLS regression
The variables from Table 1 were incorporated into an ordinary
least squares (OLS) regression with a logit transformation of the
dependent variable to normalize distributions of EV market share.
This transformation is appropriate when data are skewed, or
bounded such as with a proportion (Lesaffre et al., 2007).
A histogram of the EV market share was skewed to the right,
and the variable was a proportion. After the logit transformation, a
second histogram showed EV market share to be normally

5.1. Correlation analysis of model variables
Looking at relationships between individual variables can help
to highlight dynamics that are not evident in linear regression
models. Appendix A provides a Pearson's correlation coefﬁcient
and statistical signiﬁcance between the variables used in the base
model speciﬁcation. One of the patterns that appears when
analyzing this matrix is that many of the EV-speciﬁc variables
are strongly correlated (price, year of introduction, availability,
market share, ﬁnancial incentives, and charging infrastructure),
indicating that industrial dynamics can become interwoven during
the early commercialization of a radical innovation. Another
observation is that the EV price variable has a negative correlation
to a country's market share. Mitsubishi MiEVs were most expensive in countries where adoption rates were low e.g., Turkey,
China, and New Zealand, and they were cheaper in the US,
Norway, and Japan, countries with relatively high EV market
shares. Sometimes this difference was dramatic as with Australia
($53,126) and Switzerland ($26,925). And while it is difﬁcult to
draw any conclusive results from such correlations, they do
provide a good basis for further analysis.
An additional correlation that was not included in Appendix A
was between charging infrastructure and the type of EV (plug-in
hybrid or purely battery electric). Potentially, a country with a
higher proportion of plug-in hybrid-electric vehicles (PHEVs)
would have less dependence on charging stations, which could
weaken the relationship between a country's EV adoption and its
charging infrastructure. However, preliminary model estimations
identify that percent of PHEVs did not have a statistically signiﬁcant relationship to either charging infrastructure or EV market
share. This suggests that the proportion of a country's EVs with an
internal combustion engine does not signiﬁcantly relate to its
charging infrastructure or adoption rate.
5.2. Descriptive analysis of EV-speciﬁc variables
In addition to socio-demographic factors such as income and
education level, our model also incorporated several EV-speciﬁc
variables including ﬁnancial incentives, charging infrastructure,
model availability, and presence of a local manufacturing facility.
The descriptive analysis of these variables provided below identiﬁes how signiﬁcant correlations found in Appendix A can actually
involve a great deal of heterogeneity and diversity, indicating the
existence of other inﬂuential factors.

For the policies analyzed in our study, CO2 emissions were calculated from a
vehicle's tailpipe, based on standard driving cycles e.g., NEDC and FTP-75.

5.2.1. Financial incentives
Financial incentives and EV adoption in Fig. 1 display a positive
and signiﬁcant relationship (P-value of.01). Even so, there is
substantial variation among the data points. In addition, there
appears to be two groups of countries. The ﬁrst is constituted by
approximately the bottom half of our study sample (14 countries)
as represented by nations with ﬁnancial incentives less than
$2000. They exhibited lower EV market shares with the exceptions
of Sweden (0.30%) and Switzerland (0.23%), and to a lesser extent

Fig. 2. Breakdown of ﬁnancial subsidies types offered by countries.

Germany (0.12%), and Canada (0.13%). Consequently, 10 countries
showed little EV activity as measured by either ﬁnancial incentives
or EV adoption.
The other group in Fig. 1 is distinguished by the countries with
higher levels of ﬁnancial incentives and greater variation in their
EV market shares. Some countries such as Norway and Estonia
matched high ﬁnancial incentives with increased EV adoption.
However, this relationship was not uniform as other countries,
including Denmark and Belgium, offered high ﬁnancial incentives
but had relatively low levels of adoption. Fig. 1 suggests that there
are factors other than ﬁnancial incentives that drive EV adoption.
In addition to variables captured by the model, there are likely to
be country-speciﬁc factors that inﬂuenced national EV market shares.
For instance, consumers in Estonia adopted 55 EVs in 2011 (Mnt.ee,
2013), but the federal government decided to purchase approximately 500 MiEVs in 2012 (Estonia, 2011). That single act largely
explains why it had such a high market share in 2012. Conversely,
Norway installed extensive charging infrastructure in 2009, and has
experienced a more gradual increase in EV adoption rates since 2010,
predominantly through household consumers (SAGPA, 2012). An
additional factor which is not captured by the ﬁnancial incentive
variable is the subsidy's recipient. Through their purchase of a

majority of EVs through 2012, ﬂeet managers were identiﬁed as
being very important early adopters (IEA, 2013). However Belgium's
ﬁnancial incentives were directed speciﬁcally toward households, so
they may have largely missed engaging the ﬂeet market, hurting the
country's adoption ﬁgures. These country speciﬁc factors provide
insight into factors not included in the model that had the potential
to greatly inﬂuence national EV adoption levels.
As identiﬁed in Section 4, countries employed several different
types of ﬁnancial incentives based on the vehicle's tonnage,
company car status, emissions, and powertrain, which can be
broadly categorized as either registration or circulation subsidies.
Fig. 2 identiﬁes how countries approached ﬁnancial incentives
according those policy categories.
Fig. 2 notes that most available EV ﬁnancial incentives (78%)
came in the form of registration as opposed to circulation
subsidies. The difference between the two is that registration
funds were offered the year that the EV was purchased while those
based on a vehicle's annual circulation provided beneﬁts over a
multiple year time span. Perhaps one reason why registration
subsidies were the dominant form of ﬁnancial incentives is due to
consumer high discount rates for circulation subsidies, effectively
lowering their perceived value. A correlation test between EV

Charging stations per 100,000 residents

5.2.2. Charging infrastructure
Fig. 3 exhibits a positive and signiﬁcant relationship (P-value
of.000) between charging stations (adjusted for population) and
EV adoption rates. Despite an overall positive correlation, there
were examples of wide discrepancies in the data as evidenced by
Estonia and Israel. Both countries had similar proportions of
charging stations, but Estonia had an EV adoption level 11 times
higher than that of Israel. There also appears to be seven countries
with very low levels of both charging stations and EV adoption.
Not as much information is available about national charging
infrastructure as ﬁnancial incentives, perhaps because in many
countries they are largely installed by local municipalities (Bakker
and Trip, 2013). Among the countries in our sample, there have
been several different approaches to building charging infrastructure from federal mandate (Estonia) to auto manufacturer led
(Japan) to local government initiative (Belgium) to public–private

partnerships (Norway) (Estonia, 2011; SAGPA, 2012; ASBE, 2013;
Nobil, 2012). This variety in approach to charging infrastructure
development likely relates to other factors that inﬂuence EV
adoption e.g., local involvement.
Analyzing Figs. 1 and 3, ﬁve (out of the 30) countries showed
very little activity during the introductory phase of EVs, as
measured by ﬁnancial incentives, adoption, or charging infrastructure installation. Thus, countries in our study could be divided into
two groups with divergent attitudes toward EV adoption as
reﬂected by government policy and consumer purchase behavior.
One set of countries seemed to be actively engaged in the EV
introductory market while the other appeared to show very little
interest. However, the discrepancy between the two groups will
likely have little effect on the overall success or failure of EVs as
the countries invested in their adoption represent a substantial
majority of global GDP based on national purchasing power parity
(World Bank, 2013c).

how these factors interact, Fig. 4 looks at three such variables: the
number of models available for purchase; whether a country produced
EVs locally (bolded columns); and adoption rates.
In total, 45 different types of EVs were purchased in 2012
although a small number of models such as the Nissan Leaf, Chevy
Volt/Opel Ampera, and Toyota Plug-in Prius accounted for the
lion's share (62%) of those sales. The Mitsubishi MiEV was the
most widely available, being adopted in 26 of the countries in our
sample. There was a positive correlation between a country's EV
adoption rate and the number of models that were available for
purchase. In many instances, manufacturers sold a limited number
of several different EV models in their native country e.g., Ford in
the US and Mercedes in Germany. In those instances, manufacturers were likely experimenting with a limited production of
speciﬁc EV models before expanding their sales efforts.
Countries where native manufacturers heavily invested in EVs
e.g., Japan, France, and the US, had some of the highest EV market
shares. Other countries with EV production facilities but low
adoption rates including Germany and Italy did not have EVs
made by native manufacturers broadly available. This suggests a
strong relationship between consumer adoption of EVs and their
being manufactured by native ﬁrms. Several of the larger countries
were much more prone to adopt native models, speciﬁcally China
and Japan where only EVs from native manufacturers were
purchased. Of those two countries, China stands out because very
few EVs made by Chinese auto makers were sold outside the
country. Many manufacturers e.g., Ford, Audi and Mia Electric,
were nation-speciﬁc with sales only or primarily occurring in the
country where their production facilities were located. The relationship between the variables in Fig. 4 suggests a complex
relationship between consumers, manufacturers, and national
attitude regarding EVs.

date, charging infrastructure, and electricity price. We used graphical
and numerical analyses to ensure that the data met expectations
of linearity, normality, and homoskedasticity. We used ANOVA
tests and histograms to test for linearity, Shapiro–Wilk tests for
normality, and visual analysis of scatter plots for heteroskedasticity.
The model's adjusted R2 was 0.628 which means that almost 2/
3 of the variation in national EV market shares was explained by
the tested variables. The coefﬁcients for ﬁnancial incentives and
charging infrastructure were positive and statistically signiﬁcant
with P-values of 0.039 and 0.004 respectively. Of those two
variables, charging infrastructure had higher Beta values (both
standardized and unstandardized), indicating that it was stronger
at estimating adoption levels. Thus, adding a charging station (per
100,000 residents) had a greater impact on predicting EV market
share than did increasing ﬁnancial incentives by $1000. The
presence of a local EV manufacturing facility was also a signiﬁcant
variable, although to a lesser extent with a P-value of 0.079.
From the information in Table 3, it is possible to extrapolate the
relationship of both ﬁnancial incentives and charging infrastructure to EV market share. Holding all other factors constant, each
$1000 increase in ﬁnancial incentives would cause a country's EV
market share to increase by 0.06%. For example, a country with an
EV market share of 0.22% that increased its ﬁnancial incentives to
consumers by $2000 would see its adoption rate go up to 0.34%
(0.22% þ0.06% þ0.06%). For charging infrastructure, holding all
other factors constant, each additional station per 100,000 residents that a country added would increase its EV market share by
0.12%. This suggests that each charging station (per 100,000
residents) could have twice the impact on a country's EV market
share than $1000 in consumer ﬁnancial incentives, albeit with
different bearings on a nation's budget.
However, as a note of caution, while our model did identify that
ﬁnancial incentives and charging infrastructure were positively
correlated to national EV adoption levels, there is no guarantee
that these relationships hold for all countries, as evidenced in
Figs. 1 and 3. For example, in Fig. 1 Belgium and Denmark had very
high ﬁnancial incentives, but relatively low rates of adoption.
Conversely, Switzerland and Sweden exhibited the opposite
dynamic with low consumer subsidies but high EV uptake levels.
Fig. 3 displayed the same sort of mixed relationship between
charging infrastructure and EV market share. Thus, ﬁnancial
incentives and charging infrastructure should be seen as being
likely but not certain to predict a country's EV adoption rate.
The empirical results provide a useful comparison with stated
preference surveys. While charging infrastructure and ﬁnancial
incentives were (as expected) signiﬁcant in predicting EV adoption, this was not the case with broader socio-demographic
variables e.g., income, education, environmentalism, and urban
density that the literature had anticipated to be inﬂuential (Lane
and Potter, 2007; Gallagher and Muehlegger, 2011; Egbue and
Long, 2012). In addition, despite its strong and positive correlation
to HEV adoption in earlier studies (Diamond, 2009; Beresteanu
and Li, 2011; Gallagher and Muehlegger, 2011), fuel price was not
signiﬁcant in predicting a country's EV market share. However,
there are fundamental differences in those papers and our study
that could help explain these conﬂicting results. Firstly, the HEV
studies examined a single nation over several years whereas our
study looked at several countries for a single year. Secondly, fuel
prices in those earlier studies exhibited much greater variation
than was found in our data. Conversely, it could be that differences
such as the complexity of total ownership cost calculation and the
role of charging infrastructure result in fuel prices not having the
same impact on EV purchases that they do with HEVs. More
research is necessary to identify the relationship between fuel
price and EV adoption, speciﬁcally studies that span multiple years
and look at a single country.

5.3.1. Sensitivity tests
In addition to econometric results found in Table 3, we also
performed several estimations to test the sensitivity of different
variables (speciﬁcally ﬁnancial incentives and charging infrastructure) and the base model's overall robustness. These are described
below in Tables 4 and 5 and are referred to as Models 1–5
respectively. The individual variable(s) explored through sensitivity
analysis is identiﬁed below the Model's number e.g., charging
infrastructure in Model 1.
In Model 1, normalizing charging infrastructure for urban
density did not drastically affect results with the variables ﬁnancial incentives, production facilities, and charging infrastructure
remaining signiﬁcant while the adjusted R2 (0.613) was also
similar to that of the base estimation. As such, the base model

remains robust to this sensitivity test. Model 2 explored the
sensitivity of EV adoption to ﬁnancial incentives with different
discount rates and payback periods. While the US Energy Information National Energy Modeling System uses a 3 year payback
period and discount rate of 30%, other studies have found that
consumers, speciﬁcally businesses and government agencies, may
more accurately calculate the total lifetime costs of an innovation
(Nesbitt and Sperling, 1998; Menanteau and Lefebvre, 2000). As
such, we ran a sensitivity test for a lower discount rate (1.25%) and
longer payback period (8 years, which is the warranty period for a
Nissan Leaf or Chevy Volt). This approach resulted in $25,000
more in available ﬁnancial incentives from $180,000 in the base
model. This sensitivity test did not substantially change the
signiﬁcant variables (ﬁnancial incentives, charging infrastructure,
and EV manufacturer location) or the models adjusted R2, (0.628)
suggesting that differences in discount value and payback period
have a relatively weak inﬂuence on national EV adoption rates,
although that could be due to the small number of multi-year
consumer subsidies i.e., those that address circulation taxes.
Sensitivity analyses 3–5 show how the model's explanatory
power changed with the removal of ﬁnancial incentives and
charging infrastructure variables. Removing the ﬁnancial incentives variable in Model 3 resulted in the adjusted R2 decreasing
from 0.623 in the base analysis to 0.533. Taking out charging
infrastructure in Model 4 caused a more drastic reduction in
adjusted R2 to 0.391. Removal of both factors in Model 5 caused
the model to lose most of its explanatory power; it had no
signiﬁcant variables and an adjusted R2 of 0.238. From these
sensitivity tests this it is possible to conclude that in our model,
charging infrastructure was considerably stronger than ﬁnancial
incentives in explaining EV adoption rates.
There were several limitations in our models which had the
potential to produce misleading results. During the introduction of
new technologies, there are often discrepancies in supply among
locales. Differences in EV availability by locality may have contributed
to variation in national adoption numbers. In addition, our study
analyzed ﬁnancial incentives from national governments. There are
undoubtedly monetary beneﬁts, such as free parking or toll exemptions provided by regions and cities that were not included in this
study and were likely to have been inﬂuential. The small number of
observations per year is also cause for caution when interpreting the
results. Furthermore, by only studying 1 year, the data does not allow
for analysis of the relationship between important variables e.g.,
ﬁnancial incentives and charging infrastructure.

6. Conclusions
The purpose of this research was to explore the relationship
between ﬁnancial incentives and other socio-economic factors to
electric vehicle adoption across several countries. We found that
ﬁnancial incentives, the number of charging stations (corrected for
population), and the presence of a local EV manufacturing facility
were positive and signiﬁcant in predicting EV adoption rates for the
countries in our study. Of those variables, charging infrastructure was
the best predictor of a country's EV market share. However, descriptive analyses indicated how country-speciﬁc factors such as government procurement plans or the target recipient of subsidies could
dramatically affect a nation's adoption rate. On the whole this analysis
provides tentative endorsement of ﬁnancial incentives and charging
infrastructure as a way to encourage EV adoption.
A second conclusion is that EV-speciﬁc factors were discovered
to be signiﬁcant while broader socio-demographic variables such
as income, education level, and environmentalism were not good
predictors of adoption levels. This could be because national EV
markets were so small relative to overall automobile sales. Thus,

Author's personal copy
192

W. Sierzchula et al. / Energy Policy 68 (2014) 183–194

while many EV consumers may have high levels of education and
be passionate about the environment, within the perspective of a
country such individuals still represent a tiny portion of the overall
population. Therefore, socio-demographic variables may not provide a good indicator of adoption levels when comparing countries. If EVs emerge from a niche market, then socio-demographic
data might be more accurately used to predict adoption levels at
the national scale. Until then, EV-speciﬁc factors such as amount of
charging infrastructure, level of consumer ﬁnancial incentives, and
number of locations that sell the automobiles are likely to be more
correct for estimating a country's market share.

6.1. Policy implications
Based on our results, a sensible policy approach for addressing
EV market failures arising from pollution abatement and knowledge spillover would be for governments to provide consumer
subsidies and/or increase their number of charging stations. Due
to the importance of consumer adoption during the commercial
introduction of a radical innovation (Nemet and Baker, 2009), such
supportive measures could make a wide difference in the level of
EV diffusion in the coming decades. As the charging station
variable was the strongest predictor of EV adoption based on Beta
values stress tests, their installation may be more effective than
ﬁnancial incentives. However, since these two factors are likely to
be complimentary, supporting both measures could be expected to
lead to higher market shares than focusing on either ﬁnancial
incentives or charging infrastructure alone.
However, this study also provides three notes of caution to
countries that expect that they can achieve high EV adoption rates
by increasing their levels of ﬁnancial incentives or charging
infrastructure. Firstly, the descriptive analysis identiﬁed several
countries that displayed a relatively weak relationship between
the two factors and EV market share. Secondly, it is possible that
ﬁnancial incentives or charging infrastructure mask other
dynamics which are signiﬁcant in driving EV adoption. Consequently, building policy only around those two factors may not
support important underlying elements. Thirdly, due to the constantly evolving environment during the emergence of a radical
innovation, industrial dynamics may change from year to year.
Therefore, while this study does show that ﬁnancial incentives and
charging infrastructure are positively correlated to national EV
market shares, it is deﬁnitely not evidence of a causal relationship
and should be treated with prudence.

While national governments have been primarily responsible
for consumer ﬁnancial incentives, installing charging points has
largely been left to local public bodies such as cities (IEA, 2013).
However, the IEA (2013) found that “infrastructure spending has
been relatively sparse” (pp. 16), which suggests that local and
national levels of government should strengthen coordination in
order to better encourage EV adoption, supporting earlier research
by Bakker and Trip (2013).
Now that we have identiﬁed policies that could be effective in
encouraging EV adoption, a next question is whether they are
actually efﬁcient in a societal and economical sense. To answer this
question, an elaborate ex-ante Cost Effectiveness Analysis (CEA) or
Cost Beneﬁt Analysis (CBA) would be needed. However, given the
dynamic nature of radical innovations, one should be careful when
applying these methods to the EV case. That is to say, EVs may not
signiﬁcantly reduce GHG emissions in the short term, but they
have the potential to cause dramatic decarbonization post 2020
(IEA, 2012c), assuming a dramatic increase of the share of renewables in the electricity mix. In that respect, ﬁnancial incentives
today may be important for stimulating broader EV adoption in
the future, and consequently may provide beneﬁts outside those
typically included in a status quo based CBA. Such additional
beneﬁts may be reason to implement these policies even if the
results from a traditional CBA were not very favorable.
Furthermore, it is difﬁcult to compare the costs of ﬁnancial
incentives for EVs with at least some competing policy options to
reduce CO2 emissions. Financial incentives to increase the sales of
EVs on a temporary basis may be needed in the early stages of EVs
because they cannot compete yet with internal combustion engine
vehicles. If, in a few decades, EVs would become a success,
ﬁnancial incentive policies could prove to have contributed to this
success. In other words, there may be a snowball effect of current
ﬁnancial incentives which are fundamentally difﬁcult to grasp in a
conventional CEA or CBA. We therefore suggest that these analyses
can be used to support decision making, but that their outcomes
should be treated with caution and that decision makers should
always take a long term perspective when interpreting these.
6.2. Suggestions for future research
This study looked at a country's total charging infrastructure,
not taking into account how a heterogeneous distribution of
charging stations (many in one city, few elsewhere) might inﬂuence EV adoption. Speciﬁcally because of the important role
played by local municipalities in installing charging infrastructure,

their allocation could have an important affect on a country's
EV adoption rate (Bakker and Trip, 2013). Therefore, we suggest
that future research focus on the relationship between the
distribution of charging infrastructure within a country and its
EV adoption rate.
In addition, our model found charging infrastructure and
ﬁnancial incentives to be powerful predictors of EV adoption rates
for the countries in our sample. However, it is possible that the
variables concealed other important factors. Therefore, further
analysis is necessary to unpack the importance of charging
infrastructure and ﬁnancial incentives to determine whether they
are on their own good predictors of EV adoption, or if there are
other elements that also need to be present but were not included
in our model. For instance, fuel price volatility may provide insight
into EV adoption that is not captured through absolute fuel prices.
