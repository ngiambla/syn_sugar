 
 1 The first and second defendants, Gordon Bradley Elkington ('Dr Elkington') and Gepps Pty Limited ('Gepps'), hold preference shares in Harris  Co Pty Ltd ('the Company').
The Plaintiff, Regional Publishers Pty Limited ('Regional'), desires to acquire those preference shares compulsorily, pursuant to the provisions of Part 6A.2 of Chapter 6A of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) ('the Act').
Regional is able to do so, so long as it satisfies the prerequisites of Part 6A.2 and, in the events that have happened, it establishes that the terms on which it proposes to acquire the preference shares give a fair value for them.
Dr Elkington and Gepps say that Regional has not satisfied the prerequisites of Part 6A.2 and that, in any event, the terms upon which Regional proposes to acquire their preference shares does not give them a fair value for the preference shares.
