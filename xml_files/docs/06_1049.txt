 
 HIS HONOUR: 
 Introduction 
 
1 This is a claim concerning allegedly unlawful termination of employment brought by the applicant against his former employer, John Holland Group Pty Ltd ('John Holland'), and its managing director, William Wild, alleging breach of contract and breaches of s 52 and s 53B of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth), and s 42 and s 46 of the Fair Trading Act 1987 (NSW) and a breach of contract.
John Holland and one of its subsidiaries, GridComm Pty Ltd ('GridComm') cross claim against Mr Serventi alleging contraventions of s 181 and s 182 of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth), and breaches of fiduciary and contractual duties.
2 As was acknowledged at the hearing, the case boils down to whether Mr Serventi so misbehaved as to warrant his summary dismissal.
In my opinion he did.
Background 
 
3 The case centres on the conduct of Mr Serventi in 2003 in his capacity as a senior employee of John Holland, and as the General Manager and a director of GridComm, and his subsequent summary dismissal from that position without pay in lieu of notice or redundancy pay.
The alleged conduct in question, which is itself largely uncontroverted, comprised four kinds of alleged serious and wilful misconduct.
However, as the case unfolded, it is sufficient to deal with only one of these, namely, Mr Serventi's taking of John Holland's vehicles for the private use of his son, Anthony, who was not an employee of John Holland.
Without prejudice to the major issue, Mr Serventi agreed to pay for reasonable loss incurred by John Holland in relation to those vehicles.
4 In response to the alleged misconduct, John Holland summarily terminated Mr Serventi's employment, without payment in lieu of notice; however, other entitlements such as annual leave and superannuation were paid in full.
Mr Serventi claims that he reasonably or at least actually believed that he was entitled to take the vehicles for his son's use.
Relevant legal principles 
 
5 The law relevant to this case may be simply stated.
6 An employer is entitled to summarily dismiss an employee for serious and wilful misconduct.
Such misconduct must be of a kind that, as a practical matter, is likely to make maintenance of the contract of employment impractical.
Some employees have special obligations of conduct and confidence that are relevant to such a question of misconduct.
A senior manager of a company who is also a director is an example.
Mr Serventi was that.
7 As Gleeson CJ, Gaudron and Gummow JJ confirmed in Concut Pty Ltd v Worell (2000) 176 ALR 693 (at [25]), citing Blyth Chemicals Ltd v Bushnell [1933] HCA 8 ; (1933) 49 CLR 66 (at 81):
 
 'Conduct which in respect of important matters...is destructive of the necessary confidence between the employer and employee, is a ground of dismissal'.



The respondents' case here is that, if a senior manager arranged significant private use by a relative of his employer's assets, knowing that he was not entitled to do so, then as Kirby J put it in Concut at [50]: 
 
 'Given the nature of an ordinary employment relationship, at least as here in the case of a senior employee serving as the Queensland Branch Manager of a private company with national operations, the result reached by the primary judge seems unsurprising and appropriate.
The notion that an employer, in such a case, does not enjoy a right summarily to terminate the relationship with such a senior employee, would appear to be an odd one: one out of step with common sense.
To suggest that the common law would effectively insist that such parties continue in the personal, and often quite close and trusting, relationship of employment, as if nothing had happened, would seem remarkable.
The effect of this would be to demand the employer put out of mind (as it were) the discovery of the misconduct, and continue to pay the employee under the supervening service agreement as if nothing had occurred.
This is a conclusion to which a court would need to be driven by clear legal authority or by singular factual circumstances of the case, so far undisclosed in this matter.

8 The parties accepted that the employer had the onus of establishing serious and wilful misconduct.
9 Dishonest misappropriation of his employer's assets was alleged against Mr Serventi.
Such allegations are serious in the sense discussed in Briginshaw v Briginshaw [1938] HCA 34 ; (1938) 60 CLR 336.
As Dixon J put it, '[they affect] the process by which reasonable satisfaction is attained' by the Tribunal of fact: Briginshaw at 363.
In such cases, '"reasonable satisfaction" should not be produced by inexact proofs, indefinite testimony or indirect inferences': Briginshaw at 362.
Long service in a company with a particular culture 
 
10 Mr Serventi had been employed by (or credited by Transfield Construction Pty Ltd ('Transfield') and John Holland) with service for Transfield since 1957.
On 1 February 2003 John Holland acquired Transfield's business and Mr Serventi and most other Transfield employees became employees of John Holland.
11 At all relevant times Transfield was a privately owned company wholly owned by Transfield Holdings Pty Ltd ('Transfield Holdings').
The corporate culture of Transfield was, in some respects, akin to a familial organisation and fairly described by a John Holland analyst in 2003 in the following terms:
 
 'The culture of the company is dominated in many ways by the history of its evolution --- a strong Italian founder who remained at the head of the private company, officially or unofficially for fifty years, and made it what it is today.

 
 The culture is characterised by this legacy.
Forty percent of the staff employees and thirty three percent of the wages employees are more than fifty years old.

 
 The vast majority of these employees are of Italian descent and have lengths of service greater than fifteen years.

 
 Their preference is for the old ways of doing things, both at a micro level and at a macro level eg: using your own plant and equipment with your own workforce in your own fabrication shop etc --- vertical integration.

 
 They have had a "figure" to look up to as the "boss" and problems will emerge as this has now been displaced.

 
 Attempts have been made by the company in the recent years to break down the "silo" mentality that developed over the years.
Small fiefdoms were built up with people protecting their own patch.
Despite the restructure carried out there is still, from the older employees, a good deal of resistance to this.
It is well known that cultural change is difficult to achieve within such groups unless a structured approach is taken to the change management process.

 
 ... 
 
 The main weakness is that of the dominant group outlined above.
