 (Final judgment) 
 1.
INTRODUCTION 
 
1 This case concerns the use of so called "celebrities" in advertising.
2 The celebrity of immediate interest now says that he agreed to be part of a company's deceitful advertisement, provided the price was right.
He said he supposed that but for his family's reaction, he would have continued to lie for money.
Having "turned Queen's evidence", he is now the key witness against others who are said by him to have been involved in the deception.
3 A person who was the general manager of the company at the time bears such a strong grudge against his former employer because of the circumstances in which his employment was terminated, that he offered his services as a witness against the company.
In addition to other things, he says that at the time in question he was not concerned as to whether the company's advertising was true or false, provided the celebrity had authorised publication.
4 The company' s 51 percent shareholder and chief executive officer was defensive, expressed himself in assertive, absolute terms, and was generally an unsatisfactory witness.
5 The company's "public relations and publicity consultant", who procured the celebrity and was the intermediary between him and the company, who suggested and was heavily involved in drafting the advertisement, and was generally at the heart of events, chose not to enter the witness box, even though he was also sued.
6 In sum, the key figures inspired little confidence.
If the circumstances of the case are even remotely typical, truth in advertising is in a sorry state indeed.
7 The applicant ("the ACCC") applies under ss 80 and 86C of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) ("the Act ") and s 21 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) for orders arising from alleged misleading and deceptive conduct in contravention of s 52 of the Act .
The proceeding was resolved as between ACCC and the third respondent, Ian Bruce Turpie ("Mr Turpie"), by the making of orders by consent.
It remains on foot, however, as against the first respondent ("AMI") as alleged principal contravener, and the second respondent, Philip Somerset ("Mr Somerset"), on the basis that he was knowingly concerned in, or a party to, AMI's contravention.
8 The proceeding arises out of a newspaper advertisement ("the Advertisement") relating to a "nasal delivery system" or "nasal spray" supplied by AMI which has the purpose of curing or alleviating the effects of the condition of impotence or erectile dysfunction in the human male.
The following is a copy of the Advertisement:
 


 
 
9 The Advertisement is to be distinguished from earlier drafts of a "confessional advertisement" and from two later versions that were published.
It will be noted that the Advertisement mentions Mr Turpie's wife, Jan. Two earlier drafts referred to a fictitious wife, "Roxanne".
Both of the later published versions omitted any reference to Mr Turpie's wife, one being in a short form and the other being in a longer form.
It is only the Advertisement that is sued upon.
10 The Advertisement was first published in the Weekend Australian of 27/28 March 2004 and in the Sunday Herald Sun on 28 March 2004.
It was also published in those two newspapers, as well as the Sunday Telegraph , the Sunday Mail , the Sunday Times and the Sunday Tasmanian over the period commencing 27/28 March until 18 April 2004.
2.
PLEADINGS 
 
11 The ACCC contends that the Advertisement contained the following representations:
 
 
 "(a) [that AMI's] nasal delivery system had cured or alleviated [Mr] Turpie of the effects of the condition known as impotence or erectile dysfunction; and 
 (b) [that Mr] Turpie had undertaken an interview during which he disclosed, in the presence of his wife, the matter referred to in (a) above.
" 
 
 

The ACCC contends that the representations are implied from the Advertisement because they are the natural inferences to be drawn from its text.
12 The representations are said to have been misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive because, in the case of representation (a), Mr Turpie had never used AMI's nasal delivery system in connection with treatment of the condition mentioned, and in the case of representation (b), an interview at which his wife was present as described in the Advertisement had never taken place.
13 The case against Mr Somerset is that he knew that the Advertisement was being published and contained the representations and that they were false, and that he was responsible for the preparation and publication of the Advertisement.
The ACCC contends that Mr Somerset, who conducts a business known as "ColbyCo Media", was the person or one of the persons who drafted the Advertisement; that on or about 23 March 2004 and shortly after that date, he had sent drafts of an earlier form of advertisement to Mr Turpie containing representations similar to representations (a) and (b), and obtained his approval to publication of an advertisement in accordance with the drafts; and that he arranged for and caused the publication of the Advertisement.
14 The ACCC's case against Mr Turpie was that he was accessorially liable, on the basis that his knowledge was the same as Mr Somerset's, and that he had allowed himself to be held out by AMI as a person who had done and said the things described in the Advertisement.
15 AMI cross claims against Mr Turpie for a declaration that he engaged in trade or commerce in misleading or deceptive conduct by representing to AMI and Mr Somerset that he had used the nasal spray for the purpose of alleviating the effects of erectile dysfunction, that it had alleviated those effects, and that his wife was aware of and endorsed both of those representations, when in fact he had not used the spray for that purpose and his wife was not aware of and had not endorsed the representations.
16 In its cross claim against Mr Turpie, AMI seeks damages pursuant to ss 42 and 68 of the Fair Trading Act 1987 (NSW) to the extent necessary to indemnify AMI in respect of its liability to pay for the cost of publication of any corrective advertising which it may be ordered to publish, and legal costs, including any costs which AMI may be ordered to pay and AMI's own costs of defending the proceeding.
17 AMI admits that the Advertisement contains a representation that AMI's nasal delivery system had "alleviated" the effects of impotence or erectile dysfunction, but denies that it contains a representation that the product "cured" him of those effects.
AMI admits that the Advertisement contains representation (b), and says that it also contains a representation that Mrs Jan Turpie ("Mrs Turpie") was aware of and endorsed the representations attributed to Mr Turpie in the Advertisement.
18 AMI does not admit that Mr Turpie had never used AMI's product in connection with the treatment of the condition mentioned, and says that representation (b) was substantially and materially true and not misleading or deceptive.
AMI's position in relation to representation (b) is that while Mrs Turpie was not present at the interview, she knew and approved of the Advertisement.
19 Mr Somerset admits that the Advertisement carried both representations, but not that they were misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive.
He admits that he was responsible for preparing the Advertisement and for its being published.
3.
THE EVIDENCE 
 3.1 Brief outline of events 
 
20 As will become apparent, there is conflicting evidence on the precise detail and chronology of events the subject of this dispute.
However, the following outline suffices to convey the general chain of events.
21 In around July 2003, Mr Somerset, AMI's publicity consultant, approached Mr Turpie on behalf of AMI.
As a result, Mr Turpie, an entertainer and "celebrity", agreed to be featured in a newspaper advertisement promoting a nasal spray produced and sold by AMI.
This advertisement contained a photograph of Mr Turpie, and featured the words, "It works!
" and "Come on down ... and make the call!
You won't believe the results!
" ("the 'It works' advertisement").
22 In around late October 2003, Mr Turpie spoke to a doctor at AMI, and received the nasal spray, which he "used".
The circumstances surrounding this event, including the nature of the use made of the spray, are the subject of contest.
23 Early in 2004, Mr Somerset approached Mr Turpie about featuring in a more persuasive "confessional advertisement".
Again, accounts of the details of this episode differ, but it is not in dispute that the upshot of it was that Mr Turpie agreed.
There were drafts of the confessional advertisement and finally the Advertisement was agreed upon.
As can be seen ([8]), in the Advertisement, Mr Turpie "confesses", to an interviewer in the presence of his wife, Jan, to having suffered from impotence and says that he has that problem no more as a result of using AMI's nasal spray.
For want of a more apt one, I will use the expression "confessional advertisement" to refer to the various forms of advertisement in which Mr Turpie is stated to "confess" to impotence, including the Advertisement itself.
24 As noted at [10], the Advertisement was published in major newspapers beginning on 27/28 March 2004.
After Mrs Turpie was shown the Advertisement by relatives in Melbourne in early April 2004, her solicitor wrote to AMI demanding that publication of it cease.
25 The Turpies' son Joshua contacted the ACCC concerning the Advertisement.
Officers of the ACCC carried out an investigation.
Mr Turpie eventually told them that in truth he had never suffered from impotence and had never used AMI's nasal spray to overcome such a problem.
3.2 The witnesses 
 
26 The ACCC relied heavily on the testimony of Mr and Mrs Turpie.
Timothy Kinsella ("Mr Kinsella"), who was the General Manager of AMI from June 2001 to 24 June 2004, also gave evidence for the ACCC, as did Mr Loa of the ACCC.
27 AMI relied largely on the evidence of Dr Jacov ("Jack") Vaisman ("Dr Vaisman"), the founder, 51 percent shareholder, and Chief Executive Officer of AMI, and Dr John Andrew Balafas ("Dr Balafas"), a medical practitioner who worked for AMI and prescribed the nasal spray for Mr Turpie.
In addition, AMI led evidence from Robert Campbell ("Mr Campbell"), AMI's media placement consultant; Fiona Byrne ("Ms Byrne"), a journalist with the Sunday Herald Sun , who interviewed Mr Turpie over the telephone about the proposed confessional advertisement just before the Advertisement was published in her newspaper on Sunday 28 March 2004, and wrote an article about Mr Turpie that appeared in that newspaper on that date; and Simon Pristel ("Mr Pristel"), the deputy editor of the Sunday Herald Sun .
28 All of the above witnesses except Mr Pristel (whose evidence is limited and does not add to the evidence given by Ms Byrne, and therefore need not be discussed) were cross-examined.
Mr Somerset, the second respondent, did not give evidence.
29 Mr Turpie now makes a further confession: that he participated in a gross deception of the public.
He now says, and the ACCC asks me to accept, that in truth he has never suffered from impotence or erectile dysfunction or used AMI's product to overcome such a problem.
Mrs Turpie testified that she was never aware of her husband experiencing such a problem, and that he had never told her that he did.
30 I will first summarise the witnesses' evidence relating to the key events, excluding, generally speaking, their oral evidence (which is dealt with in more detail later), in particular, their cross-examination.
3.3 AMI's print advertising generally 
 On AMI's print advertising generally, Mr Kinsella said: 
 
31 He was the General Manager of AMI from June 2001 to June 2004.
He assisted in the content and placement of advertising.
He received reports on the number of calls to the various 1300 and 1800 numbers used by AMI for inquirers.
Each advertisement in each newspaper had its own number, so that AMI could monitor its effectiveness in terms of the number of calls it elicited.
32 AMI paid Mr Somerset a monthly retainer (as well as additional payments) for developing scripts for radio and television advertisements, advising on print advertisements, organising celebrity endorsements, and generating exposure for AMI through having television programs such as A Current Affair do stories on AMI products.
Bob Campbell was a media buyer responsible for obtaining "position" for AMI advertisements in newspapers.
On AMI's print advertising generally, Dr Vaisman said: 
 
33 He was the Chief Executive Officer of AMI, was always heavily involved in developing AMI's advertising strategy, and had the final say on advertising.
He usually drafted AMI's advertisements, which were then produced for publication by Mr Campbell.
He finally approved all advertisements.
34 In his capacity as a "public relations and publicity consultant", Mr Somerset introduced celebrities who endorsed AMI products.
Although there was no formal agreement, AMI paid Mr Somerset $2000 per month.
Dr Vaisman did not know what profit Mr Somerset made from the contracts he negotiated between AMI and celebrities.
35 It was not part of Mr Kinsella's job to assist with advertising content; Mr Kinsella did not work "closely" with Dr Vaisman in developing AMI's advertising campaigns; although Mr Kinsella may have had access to the reports on the level of calls to each toll-free number, it was not his role to "monitor the effectiveness of the advertising"; he (Dr Vaisman) did, however, consult widely with staff in the AMI office in relation to advertising; and it would have been only in that context that he would have shown Mr Kinsella drafts of the confessional advertisement.
3.4 Mr Somerset's approach to Mr Turpie and the "It works" advertisement 
 On Mr Somerset's approach to Mr Turpie and the "It works" advertisement, Mr Turpie said: 
 
36 At the time of testifying, he was 61 years old.
He has been an entertainer since 1953, performing in radio plays, theatre and on television, and, since 1957, in various clubs as a singer and guitarist.
37 In about July 2003 Mr Somerset telephoned him and introduced himself as representing AMI.
After a reference to other advertisements of AMI's nasal spray featuring the entertainer "Ugly Dave Gray" and the television sports presenter Tim Webster, Mr Somerset inquired whether he (Mr Turpie) would be interested in being featured similarly.
He said that only newspaper advertisements involving Mr Turpie's photograph and signature would be involved, with the possibility of some radio and television later.
He told Mr Turpie he could expect to receive $18,000 for the press advertisements --- the amount that was being paid to the other two men.
38 Soon afterwards, Mr Somerset again telephoned Mr Turpie, who said that he agreed to participate in the advertisement.
Mr Somerset undertook to send him a "Letter of Agreement", and obtained his fax number.
39 On 31 July 2003 Mr Turpie received by facsimile a "Letter of Agreement" from Mr Somerset expressed to be between Mr Turpie and AMI.
It purported to record "points" agreed to by Mr Somerset "on behalf of AMI" and Mr Turpie.
The document recorded that Mr Somerset had drawn up and negotiated the agreement and would be in charge, on behalf of AMI, of the payments to be made to Mr Turpie.
Mr Turpie undertook to give AMI permission to use his image and likeness in print media, and to use his written testimonial in print advertising by AMI for the treatment of impotence.
Importantly, however, any advertising or editorial containing Mr Turpie's image, likeness, testimonials or quotes was first to be approved by Mr Turpie as well as by AMI.
Mr Turpie was to be paid $18,000 by 12 monthly instalments.
40 In early August 2003, Mr Somerset telephoned Mr Turpie seeking a photograph of him.
Mr Turpie delivered some photographs to Mr Somerset's address, leaving them in his letterbox.
A few days later, Mr Somerset asked him to supply some sample signatures.
Mr Turpie obliged by faxing samples of his signature to Mr Somerset.
41 On 8 August 2003, Mr Somerset faxed to Mr Turpie a draft advertisement commencing "It works!
and it's available NOW at Advanced Medical Institute".
The "It works" advertisement bore a photograph of Mr Turpie and had him saying to readers, "Come on down ... and make the call!
You won't believe the results!
", followed by his signature.
(The "It works" advertisement was published in newspapers from time to time over a period from 10 August 2003 to 31 August 2003).
On Mr Somerset's approach to Mr Turpie and the "It works" advertisement, Mrs Turpie said: 
 
42 Prior to June 2003, she was already aware of advertisements featuring Ugly Dave Gray and Tim Webster that promoted cures for impotence.
In about June 2003, her husband told her that Mr Somerset had asked him to do similar advertisements, for which he would be paid $18,000 for a year, payable monthly.
He asked her what she thought about it, to which she replied:
 
 "I am for men speaking about their problems.
It's probably a good thing.
I don't think that they are too intrusive, but as the money is good, it's OK by me.
" 
 

(I do not read this passage as an acknowledgment by Mrs Turpie that her husband did have a problem of impotence or erectile dysfunction.
The passage occurs in an affidavit in which, only two paragraphs earlier, she said that throughout their 37 years of marriage, he had never been impotent or suffered from any other form of erectile dysfunction.
)
 
43 Around 8 August 2003, Mr Turpie showed her a copy of the "It works" advertisement.
She did not meet Mr Somerset or speak to him about the "It works" advertisement, but she spoke to him about ten times, commencing in late August 2003, chasing up her husband's payments.
On Mr Somerset's approach to Mr Turpie and the "It works" advertisement, Mr Kinsella said: 
 
44 In February or March 2003, AMI began offering for sale the nasal spray delivery system.
Measured by the calls received and sales made, the period March---May 2003 was not successful, and he discussed with Mr Somerset the need to "do something new".
45 In May or June 2003, at a meeting with Dr Vaisman and Mr Somerset, Mr Somerset suggested using celebrities to promote AMI's nasal spray, claiming that one celebrity, Tim Webster, was a "personal friend".
Dr Vaisman and Mr Kinsella agreed that Mr Somerset should approach Mr Webster, and advertisements featuring his photograph, signature and endorsement subsequently appeared in some newspapers.
46 At another meeting at around the same time, Mr Somerset suggested Ugly Dave Gray and Mr Turpie.
Mr Kinsella asked Mr Somerset whether Mr Gray had ever used the nasal spray, to which Mr Somerset replied, "It doesn't matter", but Dr Vaisman instructed Mr Kinsella to check AMI's database.
Mr Kinsella ascertained that AMI had no record of Mr Gray, at which point Dr Vaisman said that a doctor should speak to Mr Gray, because it was important that he try the product before an advertisement featuring him went to press.
47 Soon afterwards, at another meeting, Mr Somerset and Mr Kinsella told Dr Vaisman that Mr Turpie would be "great for our business", and Mr Somerset assured Dr Vaisman that he could "get [Mr Turpie] for the right amount [of money]".
48 In July 2003, Mr Somerset told Dr Vaisman and Mr Kinsella that Mr Turpie had agreed.
Mr Somerset prepared the "It works" advertisement which was then discussed by Mr Kinsella, Mr Campbell and Dr Vaisman.
When the final draft had been completed, Dr Vaisman told Mr Somerset that it could not be run until Mr Turpie's signature was sent to AMI.
The "It works" advertisement was run in August 2003, in South Australia, Victoria and Western Australia, but only for a few weeks because it did not result in a "significant" increase in calls to AMI.
On Mr Somerset's approach to Mr Turpie and the "It works" advertisement, Dr Vaisman said: 
 
49 Mr Somerset called him in mid-2003 to suggest using Mr Turpie to endorse AMI products, and after making some inquires he agreed to engage Mr Turpie's services for $18,000 for one year.
Shortly afterwards, Mr Somerset advised Dr Vaisman that Mr Turpie had agreed to feature in an advertising campaign for AMI.
50 The "It works" advertisement was published in the Herald Sun and the Sunday Herald Sun from 10 August to 31 August 2003.
A different advertisement, which, like the "It works" advertisement, featured a photograph of Mr Turpie and the words, "Come on down ... and make the call!
", was published in newspapers in Adelaide for 3 days from 21 March 2004.

 3.5 The events of late October/early November 2003 relating to the supply of the nasal spray to Mr Turpie and his use of it 
 On the events of late October/early November 2003 relating to the supply of the nasal spray to him and his use of it, Mr Turpie said: 
 
51 In about late October 2003, Mr Somerset telephoned him and told him he might get a phone call from someone in television who would question him about AMI's product.
In a later affidavit, he said that Mr Somerset told him the phone call would be from Today Tonight , because "they are after AMI again".
(In fact the Today Tonight program, which AMI perceived to be unfavourable to it, was screened on 16 October 2003.
) Mr Somerset asked him to say that he had used the nasal spray and that it had worked, but he replied that he could not do so because in fact he had not used it.
Mr Somerset expressed surprise and said that Mr Turpie should leave it to him.
52 Mr Somerset telephoned him again, telling him he would receive a telephone call from Dr Vaisman, the "boss" at AMI, and that he (Mr Turpie) would only have to answer a few simple questions, after which AMI would send him the product.
Immediately afterwards, he received a call from a man who spoke with a European accent.
Dr Vaisman said:
 
 "My name is Jacov Vaisman.
You will speak to one of our doctors who will ask you some questions like: 'How long have you had the problem?
', and you will say: 'It started about a year ago'.
" 

Dr Vaisman said other things which he (Mr Turpie) no longer recalls, but he remembers cutting off Dr Vaisman, saying "Leave it to me, I think I know what to say".
In a later affidavit, Mr Turpie said he received the phone call from Dr Vaisman "within an hour or two" after the first conversation with Mr Somerset.
53 Within minutes of this conversation, another man telephoned him.
It transpired that this was Dr Balafas, who worked for AMI.
They spoke as follows:
 
 
 
 "Balafas: 'I am a doctor [he gave Mr Turpie a name which Mr Turpie did not recall] .
I am just going to ask you a few questions.
' 
 
 
 
 Turpie: 'Fire away'.

 Balafas: 'When did the problem first start?
' 
 Turpie: 'About a year ago'.

 
 
 
 Balafas: 'Okay.
We will send the product to you.
Does the problem upset you?
' 
 
 
 
 Turpie: 'Oh yes, it would upset any man of my age'.
" 
 

Dr Balafas asked other questions which he (Mr Turpie) did not recall and he gave answers to them which he also did not recall.
The conversation lasted only about two minutes.
In a later affidavit, he said that the consultation may have lasted longer, perhaps five minutes, but was nonetheless "very short".
54 After seeing Dr Balafas's consultation notes (see [65]---[68] below), he agreed that the matters noted in them may have been discussed, but said he had no recollection of them.
He maintained that the consultation occurred as he described it.
55 The four conversations (Somerset (2), Vaisman, Balafas) occurred one or two weeks before Mr Turpie's 60th birthday on 6 November 2003.
56 Within about a week of the conversation with Dr Balafas, Mr Turpie received a parcel containing two nasal sprays and a set of instructions.
One spray was to address the problem of erectile dysfunction and the other contained oil to be used in the possible case of an adverse reaction.
The instructions stated, among other things:
 
 "First day --- one spray, no sex 
 Second day --- two sprays, no sex 
 Third day --- three sprays, no sex 
 Fourth day --- four sprays, no sex 
 Fifth day --- five sprays, no sex 
 
 After that, you will be able to judge how much you need.
" 
 

He used the spray for five days in accordance with the instruction sheet and did not have sexual intercourse on those days.
He found yellow mucous forming in his nose, and his nostrils became quite sore, so he used the oil nasal spray to remedy this problem.
He has not used the spray since, and has never used it at a time when engaging or attempting to engage in sexual activity.
He no longer has the product.
57 A surprise party was held for Mr Turpie's birthday at the Brookvale Hotel on 6 November 2003 (as will appear later, Mr Turpie was wrong as to this date).
On the events of late October/early November 2003 relating to the supply of the nasal spray to Mr Turpie and his use of it, Mrs Turpie said: 
 
58 In late October 2003, Mr Turpie told her he had had a conversation with Mr Somerset, who had told him that someone might ring asking him what he thought of the product.
He told her that he had told Mr Somerset that he could not respond because he had not used it.
He told her that he had then received a telephone call from a "doctor with an accent" who told him how the nasal spray worked.
59 About three weeks after receiving the spray, Mr Turpie, referring to the nasal spray, complained to her of constant sneezing, blocking of the nose and painful nostrils, and she did not see him ever use the spray "after this conversation".
His use of the spray "made no difference to [their] sex life [which] continued as normal.
"
 On the events of late October/early November 2003 relating to the supply of the nasal spray to Mr Turpie and his use of it, Dr Vaisman said: 
 
60 In October 2003, Mr Somerset told him that Mr Turpie's sixtieth birthday was coming up and that he wanted to try the nasal spray.
Mr Somerset asked if he (Dr Vaisman) could arrange for Mr Turpie to be sent some samples.
He replied that AMI could not give out samples, but that if Mr Turpie called AMI and a doctor prescribed medication, AMI would not charge Mr Turpie for it.
He denied ever calling Mr Turpie, telling him that a doctor from AMI would call him, and attempting to "coach" him concerning the answers he should give to the doctor.
61 Annexed to Dr Vaisman's affidavit of 17 December 2004 was an instruction street for the nasal spray, which Dr Vaisman said accompanied each bottle of it.
It provided for increases from one to four sprays (always "if tolerated") over five days, with "no sex" over the first four days, and on and from the fifth day, "use as needed 20---30 minutes before sex".
On the events of late October/early November 2003 relating to the supply of the nasal spray to Mr Turpie and his use of it, Dr Balafas said: 
 
62 He is a medical practitioner who worked for AMI from February 2003 to July 2004, and from 11 August 2005 to the hearing.
He had also worked for one of AMI's "predecessor companies".
He has practised "almost exclusively" in the field of men's sexual health for the last two and half years.
63 He conducted about 75 percent of his consultations with patients by telephone, which was common practice at AMI.
When a patient telephoned one of AMI's toll-free numbers, a "clinical co-ordinator" would take the patient's details and "screen" the call to determine whether the patient was calling about a health issue treatable by AMI.
If that was determined to be the case, the patient's call would be transferred to a doctor.
If no doctor was available, the clinical co-ordinator would inform the patient that a doctor would call him back, and a message would be left requesting one of the doctors to do so.
64 On 31 October 2003, he received an electronic message on his computer terminal from an AMI clinical co-ordinator, to the effect that Mr Turpie had called, "and requesting that [he --- Dr Balafas] call him back".
He did so.
He did not initiate the contact with Mr Turpie and Dr Vaisman did not tell him to do so: rather, he telephoned Mr Turpie in response to a call from him.
65 His telephone conversation with Mr Turpie lasted for five to ten minutes.
On speaking with Mr Turpie, he became aware that he was the same Ian Turpie who was in show business and who had appeared on television.
He asked Mr Turpie about his sexual health, his lifestyle (such as stress level, alcohol intake, smoking, diet and exercise), and his previous medical history (such as heart problems or diabetes, among other things).
When he asked Mr Turpie what problems he was having, Mr Turpie replied, "Over the past year, I've been finding it more difficult to get a full erection".
Dr Balafas concluded that Mr Turpie was suffering from a mild form of erectile dysfunction, which was due to anxiety or vascular constriction, or a combination of both.
66 He prescribed a treatment consisting of apomorphine (which increases the libido) and phentolamine (which is a vasodilator), to be administered nasally.
He explained its administration to Mr Turpie.
His notes of the consultation indicate that he told Mr Turpie that he should use one spray in one nostril, 15 minutes before intercourse, which might be increased to one spray in each nostril.
Clearly, these instructions were significantly different from the written instructions Mr Turpie said he received, and which Dr Vaisman said accompanied all nasal sprays sent to patients.
67 Dr Balafas emphasised that he would not prescribe treatment for a patient without taking a "proper" history and making a "proper" diagnosis.
68 Dr Balafas's handwritten notes of the consultation were annexed to his affidavit.
He considered his notes to be an accurate summary of the consultation, except that they omitted to record his enquiry as to whether Mr Turpie was a smoker (Mr Turpie said he was).
He believed he would have asked if Mr Turpie smoked, because he considered smoking to be a significant risk factor in the incidence of erectile dysfunction.
On the events of late October/early November 2003 relating to the supply of the nasal spray to Mr Turpie and his use of it, Mr Kinsella said: 
 
69 He was able to comment on the operation of AMI's system of receiving calls via toll-free numbers, because, during his employment with AMI, he was AMI's Call Centre Manager six months prior to becoming General Manager, and had assisted as a telephone salesperson at other times when AMI was short of staff.
(Mr Kinsella's account of the "screening" of calls prior to their being transferred to a doctor largely corresponded with Dr Balafas's evidence.
) However, he added that once a caller was transferred to a doctor, the salesperson listened in on the conversation.
If the doctor recommended a treatment, the caller would be transferred back to the salesperson who would "attempt to sell" the treatment program recommended by the doctor.
70 If a doctor was not available to speak to a caller within a reasonable time, the salesperson would arrange a time when a doctor at AMI, selected on a "rotary" system, was to telephone the caller.
The salesperson would complete (either on the computer or by hand) a "patient detail and assessment" sheet, that would be given to a doctor on duty.
Prior to and as at 31 October 2003, "there was no computer facility available for a salesperson to communicate electronically with one particular doctor".
71 "At some time in the second half of 2003", a new computer system was installed.
It enabled doctors working for AMI to access patient information entered by salespersons.
Under the new system, if a doctor was not available within a reasonable time, the salesperson would enter into the computer database the patient's details and a note that the patient required to be called by a doctor.
Any doctor at AMI could access this information and make the call.
The facility was called the "Doctor's Waiting Room".
Upon becoming available, a doctor would "click" onto a patient, whose details would then disappear from the "Doctor's Waiting Room" module, with the result that no other doctor would call that patient.
Under this new system, as under the old one, it was not possible for a salesperson to request a particular doctor to call a particular patient.
72 Prior to 31 October 2003, he was in Dr Vaisman's office when Dr Vaisman asked him to get Dr Balafas.
He did so.
Dr Vaisman said to Dr Balafas in his presence:
 
 "I need you to speak to Ian Turpie, we need to get him some medication before we start an advertising campaign.
" 
 

to which Dr Balafas replied:
 
 "OK, I will get onto it straight away.
" 
 

Dr Balafas then left Dr Vaisman's office.
He (Mr Kinsella) recalled this conversation after reading Dr Balafas's affidavit.
(Dr Vaisman and Dr Balafas deny that any such conversation took place.
)
 
 3.6 The events of early 2004 leading to the publication of the Advertisement on 
 27/28 March 2004 
 On the events leading to the publication of the Advertisement on 
 27/28 March 2004, Mr Turpie said: 
 
73 In about late January 2004, Mr Somerset telephoned him to say that AMI was not receiving calls in response to the "It works" advertisement, and that it would be necessary to do something "bigger and better".
The two men met in a coffee shop at Dee Why on a Sunday a couple of days later at about 10.00 am, when he told Mr Somerset that the nasal spray did not "work" and only caused a sore nose.
The conversation continued:
 
 
 
 "Somerset: 'We've got to do a big campaign about you confessing to impotence'.

 
 
 
 Turpie: 'That will cost'.

 Somerset: 'Oh, don't worry, they'll pay'.
" 
 

(Accordingly, Mr Turpie attributes the idea of a confessional advertisement to Mr Somerset in circumstances in which both men knew that it would not be true.
Mr Turpie later said that he was expecting to be paid $100,000 while Mr Somerset had mentioned $75,000, but he conceded that no figure was ever agreed.
)
 
74 After the meeting, Mr Somerset faxed him a draft advertisement which referred to him as being impotent.
He did not keep this draft because he was "worried about the wording".
He drafted and faxed to Mr Somerset his own draft which he considered more "ambiguous" about whether he was impotent.
This draft, on which he wrote " Phil , How about this?
", read as follows:
 
 "Last year, I hit the big 6.0. and, whether it's mental or physical, you begin to understand that you're not performing the way you used to.

 
 So, I decided to do something about it!
I know impotence affects a lot of blokes around my age, and most of us don't like to admit it, especially to each other!

 
 But this nasal spray is SO discreet.
And, although I initially had doubts about it being better than what was already on the market, I gave it a go!
And the first time I used it, boy, I can tell you it works.
And works.
And works!!

 
 It certainly made my sixtieth birthday!!
" 
 

(The facsimile imprint shows that Mr Turpie sent his draft to Mr Somerset on 19 February 2004.
According to the draft, Mr Turpie was implying that his ability to perform sexually had fallen off from what it used to be, and stating that he had used AMI's nasal spray which had "worked" for him and had "made" his 60 th birthday.
Mr Turpie says that virtually every relevant statement in his draft was false.
As will appear later, it is clear that he did not receive the nasal spray until after his birthday on 6 November 2003.
)
 
75 On Tuesday 23 March 2004, he received from Mr Somerset a draft headed "EXCLUSIVE --- Impotence nearly ruined my life forever".
He said in his affidavit that he could not read it, and tried to enlarge it but still could not read it.
The text was as follows:
 " EXCLUSIVE 
 
 'Impotence nearly ruined my life forever' 
 
 TV Star's amazing CONFESSION!

 Entertainer and longtime star of popular TV shows like 'The New Price is Right', Ian Turpie speaks exclusively about impotence in a frank and revealing interview.
Behind the smiling facade, Ian was struggling with a devastating secret shared by 1 in 3 Australian men --- Ian was losing his sexual potency.
'Not to be able to perform in the bedroom makes you feel like you've lost your manhood.
I even started to make excuses to avoid sex, but deep down I was ashamed.
' Finally after years of torment, Ian confessed to his wife and long-time friend Roxanne.
'It was the most difficult thing I did' he admitted.
After a deluge of tears --- from both sides --- Ian realised it was time to do something.
It was time to take action!
How I got my sex drive back!

 'I'm one of the very lucky ones', Ian says as he holds Roxanne's hand and they smile playfully at each other.
'I had heard from a friend about the Advanced Medical Institute and their new treatments.
It certainly wasn't easy, but I made the call and talked to one of their doctors.
I was embarrassed and frightened at first, but they made everything so comfortable and easy.
' 
 Ian opted for a new nasal delivery system method because 'it's so discreet and simple to use and it worked for me ... and I mean IT REALLY WORKED !
' Clearly, it has made a huge difference to both Ian and Roxanne and their love life.
'I feel like a young bloke again', says Ian and she nods coyly.
'I can't believe I waited all that time and went through all that grief.
I don't have a problem anymore and I look forward to the night time.
' Ian's story is not unique.
Over 90,000 Australian men develop impotence each year and many of them have found an answer through the Advanced Medical Institute Clinics.
Does it give you your life back?
The final word goes to Ian: 'It made my 60 th Birthday and I haven't stopped celebrating yet'!
" 
 

In a separate block below the text appeared certain advertising material concerning AMI.
76 He wrote in the margin of the draft "Phil, OK!!
Ian Turpie', and faxed it back to Mr Somerset.
77 Shortly afterwards, Mr Somerset told him that it was desired to elevate the first side heading, "TV Star's amazing confession", to the position of headline, and to relegate the existing headline, "Impotence nearly ruined my life forever", to the position of first side heading.
He agreed, and received by facsimile from Mr Somerset a further draft with the positions of those lines exchanged and with an amended text, thus:

78 He read this form of the confessional advertisement and noted that his wife's name was given as "Roxanne" rather than "Jan".
Nonetheless, he approved of the advertisement because he believed that people who knew him would know it was a joke (in cross-examination he agreed that people who did not know him would not know that it was a joke).
He wrote "OK Phil!!
Ian Turpie" in the margin and faxed the document back to Mr Somerset.
79 Every statement in this confessional advertisement was untrue.
