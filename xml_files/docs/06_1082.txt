 
 1 This is an appeal against a judgment of Barnes FM of 6 April 2006 dismissing an application for judicial review of a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal ('the Tribunal') made on 23 February 2004 and handed down on 16 March 2004.
The Tribunal had affirmed a decision of a delegate of the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs ('the Minister') made on 6 November 2003 to refuse to grant a protection visa to the appellant and his wife.
2 The appellant and his wife are citizens of India.
They arrived in Australia on 7 August 2003 and applied for a protection visa on 2 September 2003.
On 1 December 2003 the appellant and his wife applied to the Refugee Review Tribunal for a review of the decision of the delegate of the Minister.
3 In the protection visa application, and the matters before the Tribunal and Barnes FM, the wife, SZDGW, was an applicant.
SZDGW also signed the notice of appeal filed 26 April 2006 which was before me.
However at the hearing before me, it was pointed out that the appellant was listed only as SZDGV, the husband.
In the case before me the first respondent consented to the wife being formally joined as an appellant, to avoid the circumstance that, should the husband succeed in the matter before me, his application would be remitted back to the Tribunal and the wife's application would not.
Accordingly, I order that SZDGW be formally joined as a second appellant in this matter.
4 Further, I note that the original respondent to this appeal is the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs.
Following the decision of the High Court in SAAP v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2005) HCA 24 , I order that the Refugee Review Tribunal be joined as second respondent to these proceedings.

 The Tribunal's decision 
 
 5 No specific Refugees Convention claims were made by or on behalf of the appellant wife who relied on membership of the appellant husband's family unit.
In the protection visa application and before the Tribunal the appellant husband claimed a well-founded fear of persecution on grounds of religion and political opinion.
He claimed that he was a member of the Bharatiya Janata Party ('BJP'), that he supported victims of the Gujarat train massacre and due to such support was persecuted by Muslim political parties and extremist Muslims.
The appellant husband claimed to have suffered property damage, to have been attacked resulting in hospitalisation and to have received threats.
6 On 23 December 2003 the Tribunal invited the appellants to a hearing and on 13 February 2004 the Tribunal was advised in writing that the appellants did not wish to attend.
The appellants did not attend the hearing and the Tribunal proceeded to determine the matter on the evidence available to it in their absence as permitted by s 426A Migration Act 1958 (Cth) ('the Act').
