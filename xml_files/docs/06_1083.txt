 
 1 This is an appeal against a judgment of Raphael FM of 10 April 2006, dismissing an application for judicial review of a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal ('the Tribunal') made 18 November 2003 and handed down on 11 December 2003.
The Tribunal had affirmed a decision of a delegate of the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs ('the Minister') made on 6 June 2003 to refuse to grant a protection visa to the appellants.
2 The appellants are a husband, wife and daughter.
They are citizens of India.
They arrived in Australia on 29 January 2003 and applied for a protection visa on 19 February 2003.
They applied to the Tribunal for a review of the decision of the Minister's delegate on 30 June 2003.
The appellants rely on the claims of the appellant husband.
In his protection visa application and before the Tribunal the appellant husband claimed to fear persecution because of his religion and politics.
He claimed that as a Muslim living in Mumbai who was affiliated with the Samajwadi political party, he was attacked by Hindu extremists.
The appellant husband claimed that he received threats from extremists, his business was looted and burnt, his family home was ransacked, and his family members sustained injuries and required hospitalisation.
He claimed that he was living under the tension of consistent life-threatening circumstances, and the fear of persecution.

 The Tribunal's decision 
 
 3 The appellants did not attend a hearing before the Tribunal, and the Tribunal proceeded on the basis of the information before it in the Department's file, including the protection visa application and the delegate's decision record.
The Tribunal also had regard to a substantial amount of independent evidence as to the situation in India.
The Tribunal found that this indicated that there is religious freedom in India and that state and federal governments generally take vigorous and active steps to put an end to communal violence.
However, it also noted that religious tensions do arise in India and there is evidence of sporadic religious-based communal violence.
4 The Tribunal found that without further evidence it could not be satisfied of the appellants' claims and therefore was not satisfied that the appellants had a well founded fear of persecution within the meaning of the Refugees Convention.

 Decision of the Federal Magistrate 
 
 5 On 5 January 2004 the appellants filed an application for review of the decision of the Tribunal.
The appellant husband maintained his claim to be 'refugee' within the definition in the Refugees Convention.
