 Background 
 
 3 The applicant is a citizen of the People's Republic of China who arrived in Australia on 8 May 2005.
On 27 May 2005 the applicant lodged an application for a protection (class XA) visa with the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs under the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) ('the Act').
The application for a protection visa was refused by a delegate of the Minister on 24 August 2005.
On 27 September 2005 the applicant applied to the Tribunal for a review of that decision.
The applicant claimed in his protection visa application and before the Tribunal that he had a well-founded fear of persecution by the Chinese authorities for being a Falun Gong/Falun Dafa practitioner.
4 On 25 October 2005 the Tribunal wrote to the applicant advising him that it was unable to make a favourable decision on the information before it, and invited the applicant to attend a hearing.
The applicant did not contact the Tribunal and did not attend the hearing.
The Tribunal was not satisfied on the information before it (including the applicant's protection visa application and the delegate's decision record) that the applicant had a well-founded fear of persecution, and accordingly affirmed the decision not to grant a protection visa.
5 On 3 February 2006, the applicant filed an application in the Federal Magistrates Court of Australia seeking an order that the respondents show cause why a remedy should not be granted in respect of the decision of the Tribunal.
On 3 March 2006 at a directions hearing, Driver FM struck out the applicant's grounds of review but gave leave for the applicant to file an amended application.
