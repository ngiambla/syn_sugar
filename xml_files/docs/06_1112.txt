 
 1 On 9 June 2006 Pan Australia Shipping Pty Limited commenced these proceedings in rem and caused the arrest of the ship Comandate , a Liberian flagged vessel owned by Comandate Marine Corp.
I have set out some of the factual background in the judgment I delivered on 22 June 2006: Pan Australia Shipping Pty Ltd v The Ship 'Comandate' [2006] FCA 881.
I will not repeat that background here.
2 On the day after I granted an injunction restraining Comandate Marine from applying to the English Courts for an order restraining Pan from bringing claims under the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth), Comandate Marine commenced new proceedings in rem in this Court and arrested the Boomerang I , a vessel which Pan had chartered.
Later, on Pan's application, the Court set aside the arrest.
3 In the meantime Comandate Marine applied for a stay of these proceedings and for an order that Pan arbitrate the issues in the arbitration which has begun in London.
