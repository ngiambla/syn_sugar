 
 Introduction 
 
 1 Global Orthopaedic Technology Pty Limited manufactures and sells a prosthetic knee product known as the RBK Total Knee System.
Exactech Inc, through its Australian distributor, Orthotech Pty Limited, has recently introduced into the Australian market a prosthetic knee called the Optetrak RBK.
2 Global claims that the distribution, promotion and marketing of the Optetrak RBK in Australia by Orthotech and Exactech constitute misleading and deceptive conduct.
Global also claims that Orthotech's and Exactech's distribution, marketing and promotion of the Optetrak RBK under that name suggest a commercial association between Global on the one hand and Orthotech and Exactech on the other, whereas, in truth, no such association exists between those parties.
Thus it is said by Global that Orthotech and Exactech have contravened ss 52 , 53 (c) and 53 (d) of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) (the Act).
3 Mr Sam Scott-Young is a director of Orthotech and controls that company's day to day business.
Global claims that Mr Scott-Young was knowingly concerned in Orthotech's breaches of the Act.


 The Issues 
 
 4 'RBK' is an acronym.
It was derived by Mr Ribot and Mr Banks, the founders of Global, as an acronym for the term 'rotating bearing knee'.
Coincidentally the initials RBK are an abbreviation for 'Ribot Banks Knee'.
Mr Ribot's evidence was that this played some part in the selection of the name.
5 The respondents contend that rotating bearing knee is descriptive of a particular type of prosthetic knee, that RBK is an acronym for rotating bearing knee and that RBK is therefore itself descriptive.
6 It is well established that, ordinarily, the use of a descriptive trade name ensures that it is not distinctive of a business and that its application to other like businesses will not ordinarily mislead the public; Hornsby Building Information Centre Pty Limited v Sydney Building Information Centre Limited [1978] HCA 11 ; (1978) 140 CLR 216 at 229.
7 However, even if the acronym RBK is descriptive, its use by another trader may, upon a consideration of all the circumstances, amount to misleading conduct if the acronym has acquired a secondary meaning so as to be distinctive of Global's product; Equity Access Pty Ltd v Westpac Banking Corporation (1989) 16 IPR 431 at 447.
8 Importantly, Global accepts that whether or not RBK is descriptive, it cannot succeed in these proceedings unless it establishes that the acronym RBK is distinctive of its product.
That is the essential issue in these proceedings.
9 In Equity Access , Hill J said at 448 that the distinction between descriptive and fancy names is not black and white; rather, there is a continuum.
Thus, if the name RBK is closer along the continuum toward descriptive names, the heavier the onus will be upon Global to establish a secondary meaning.
Also, small differences in other names will usually be adequate to avoid confusion; Hornsby Building at 229; Equity Access at 448.
10 Thus, the second issue in the case is whether RBK is descriptive.
In a sense it is an unnecessary issue because Global's claim stands or falls on the question of whether the acronym RBK is distinctive.
Nevertheless, there was a good deal of evidence on the issue of descriptiveness and I will therefore address the question.
11 In order to determine the first and second issues, it is necessary to consider the various types of prosthetic knees that are available in the Australian market.
It is also necessary to understand the way in which participants in the market, that is to say, orthopaedic surgeons, describe the various types of prosthetic knees.
12 A key dimension to the way participants describe products is a well known habit in the medical profession of abbreviating descriptive terms to their initial letters.
Three letter abbreviations seem particularly common.
Thus, it is necessary to have regard to the use of acronyms and the way in which acronyms are applied to the relevant products.
13 The third issue is whether the distribution, promotion and marketing of the Optetrak RBK under that name would involve misleading and deceptive conduct.
Related to this is the question of whether the use of the acronym RBK in conjunction with the name Optetrak implies a commercial association between Orthotech/Exactech and Global.
14 The commercial association issue is also to be considered in light of the fact that between 2002 and 2004 Global distributed products for Orthotech and Exactech while at the same time selling its own RBK.
15 The question of whether the conduct of Orthotech and Exactech is misleading or deceptive, or likely to be so, must be determined by reference to the class of prospective purchasers of the Optetrak RBK; Parkdale Custom Built Furniture Pty Ltd v Puxu Pty Ltd [1982] HCA 44 ; (1982) 149 CLR 191 at 199; Campomar Sociedad Limitada v Nike International Limited [2000] HCA 12 ; (2000) 202 CLR 45 at 85, at [102] --- [103].
16 Prosthetic knees are purchased by orthopaedic surgeons specialising in knee replacements and by the purchasing departments of hospitals.
The nature of the market and the way in which prosthetic knees are ordered and implanted require close consideration.
This is because the whole of the circumstances must be looked at in order to determine whether the impugned conduct is misleading or deceptive; Puxu at 199.


 Background Facts: Global and the Development and Promotion of the RBK 
 
 17 Mr Michael Ribot has had a long history of involvement in the distribution of orthopaedic products.
His experience dates back to at least 1981.
18 In about 1990, Mr Ribot started distributing orthopaedic products for DePuy Inc, a leading international orthopaedic product supplier, which is now owned by Johnson  Johnson, Inc.
 19 One of DePuy's products is the DePuy low contact stress knee, which is known in the market as the DePuy LCS or the LCS knee.
20 In about 1992, Mr Ribot ceased his relationship with DePuy and became a distributor for the Australian subsidiary of a large American owned orthopaedic product manufacturer, Zimmer Holdings, Inc. Mr Ribot and Mr Banks distributed Zimmer's products in New South Wales up to about 1995. Zimmer's leading product is the Zimmer mobile bearing knee which is known as the Zimmer MBK or the MBK.
21 In about 1995, Mr Ribot and Mr Banks became New South Wales distributors for DePuy.
During about 1997 and 1998, Mr Ribot and Mr Banks discussed the possibility of establishing a company to develop and manufacture in Australia prosthetic knees and other prosthetic products for sale in Australia as well as in overseas markets.
22 Mr Ribot left his employment with DePuy in 1999 to establish Global in partnership with Mr Banks.
Global was established to develop and sell a prosthetic knee based on the DePuy LCS, but with substantial changes.
Mr Ribot and Mr Banks believed that their changes to the LCS knee would produce a better product.
23 Mr Ribot and Mr Banks, through Global, developed a prototype of their RBK prosthetic knee by about the middle of 2000.
The knee was listed with the Therapeutic Goods Administration under the product name RBK Total Knee System on 16 August 2000.
24 In the course of developing the RBK, Mr Ribot and Mr Banks had many conversations with orthopaedic surgeons in Australia to advise them that the RBK would come onto the market under that name.
The surgeons who were approached included Drs Mark Haber, John Ireland, Peter Hannaford and Robert Breit.
The two last-mentioned surgeons gave evidence in these proceedings.
25 The first Global RBK was implanted by Dr John Ireland in October 2000.
The purchase order, dated 27 October 2007, which seems to have been for the first implant, named Global Orthopaedics as the supplier.
It stated that the goods were a "consignment for RBK TRK.
" The initials TRK are an acronym for 'total knee replacement', although the usual acronym for that term is TKR.
26 From 2000 to October 2002, Mr Ribot and Mr Banks promoted the Global RBK to orthopaedic surgeons in face to face meetings.
They provided the surgeons and the surgeons' staff with promotional material in the form of a brochure entitled "The RBK Total Knee System.
A Guide for Orthopaedic Staff".
27 The brochure gives a detailed description of the knee and the procedure for implanting it.
The brochure describes the RBK Total Knee System as comprising three components.
These are, a chrome cobalt, anatomical femoral component and a polyethylene insert which is free to rotate within the inner cone of the tibial component.
28 Global distributed approximately 150 copies of the first version of the brochure.
The first version was replaced in October 2002 by a newer version with the same title.
As with the initial version of the brochure, the revised version was distributed by Global to surgeons in face to face meetings.
Global has distributed approximately 2000 copies of the revised brochure.
29 The revised brochure is replete with references to the RBK and the RBK Total Knee System.
The following explanation appears under the heading "System Introduction" on page 2 of the brochure:-
 "When in typical use, the RBK Knee System (Rotating Bearing Knee) comprises a chrome cobalt, anatomical femoral component (5 sizes left and right) and a U.H.M.W.P.E.
insert, which is designed to freely rotate within the inner cone of the tibial component.

 
 The Tibial component is also made of chrome cobalt and features a highly polished bearing surface, which articulates against the underside of the polyethylene insert.
The underside of the tibial component features four fixation spikes, which are designed to provide additional resistance to torsional forces and to provide additional fixation.

 
 The RBK also includes a polyethylene Patellar component along with a metal backed mobile bearing Patellar component.
" 
 
 30 Global has undertaken various other forms of marketing the Global RBK since mid 2000.
One method was to send out a flyer with information about the RBK to orthopaedic surgeons in New South Wales known by Global to have implanted prosthetic knees.
There were approximately 250 of those surgeons.
Global also sent 150 flyers to other orthopaedic surgeons around Australia.
The flyers described Global's knee as the RBK.
31 Another method of promotion was on Global's website.
Information about Global's RBK was first posted on the website in October 2002.
32 The original form of the website contained the following description of Global's knee:-
 "Rotating Bearing Knee (RBK) 
 When in typical use, the RBK Knee System (Rotating Bearing Knee) comprises a chrome cobalt, anatomical femoral component (5 sizes left and right) and a U.H.M.W.P.E.
insert, which is designed to freely rotate within the inner cone of the tibial component".

 
 33 At some time, after the establishment of the website, the description of the knee was altered, apparently so as to remove the words in brackets, Rotating Bearing Knee.
34 There is evidence before me of the number of monthly visits made to Global's website in the period April 2005 to March 2006.
It is not possible to say which individual pages on the website were visited.
35 Global has employed other methods of promotion including attending meetings of the Australian Orthopaedic Association, known by its acronym 'AOA', the distribution of posters and hosting and/or attending smaller meetings of orthopaedic surgeons in Australia and internationally.
36 At the AOA meetings and the smaller meetings, Global's representatives described the knee as the RBK.
Global also referred to the knee as the RBK in its posters and flyers for the smaller meetings.


 Further Background Facts: Exactech and the development and promotion of the Optetrak RBK 
 
 37 Exactech is incorporated in the State of Florida.
It is listed on the Nasdaq.
It designs, manufactures and markets orthopaedic implants.
It distributes its products through independent distributors in the USA and internationally.
38 Exactech began designing and manufacturing its knee prostheses under the Optetrak brand name in the USA and internationally in about 1992.
The Optetrak brand name is the subject of trademark protection.
39 In about 1993, Exactech adopted a naming convention under which its knee and hip prostheses are given the Optetrak name followed by an acronym for the generic description of the product.
40 From about the middle to late 1990's Orthotech began selling some of Exactech's knee prostheses in Australia.
These were the Optetrak CR, or cruciate retaining knee, the Optetrak PS, or posterior stabilized knee, and the Optetrak CC, or constrained condylar knee.
41 These knees were all fixed bearing knees, rather than mobile bearing knees.
I will refer later to the distinction between fixed and mobile bearing knees.
For present purposes it may be assumed that a rotating bearing knee is a form of mobile bearing knee.
42 It is not clear from the evidence when Exactech began the design and development of the Optetrak RBK.
It was referred to within Exactech by that name from about June 2003.
43 By no later than 3 August 2004 Exactech knew that Global manufactured and sold its knee in Australia under the RBK name.
Nevertheless, Exactech decided to proceed upon the basis that the brand name Optetrak RBK would sufficiently distinguish its knee from Global's RBK.
44 Exactech made sales of the Optetrak RBK in Europe commencing in April 2005.
It has sold the prosthesis under that brand name in nine European Union countries and in Tunisia, Turkey and New Zealand.
45 Orthotech sold the first Optetrak RBK in Australia in November or December 2005.
The unit was sold and implanted in Queensland at the Noosa Private Hospital.
46 Mr Ribot first learned of the promotion and sale of the Optetrak RBK in Australia in February 2006.
47 At about the same time Exactech sent invitations to Australian orthopaedic surgeons to attend an international meeting in Hawaii to discuss the Optetrak RBK and various other Optetrak products.
The invitation stated that the program would include discussion of the design rationale and clinical performance of the "Optetrak RBK  (Rotating Bearing Knee)".
48 By no later than March 2006, Orthotech released to the Australian market a promotional brochure describing the Optetrak RBK.
I reproduce below, a copy of the cover sheet of the brochure: 


 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 49 The brochure commences by stating that the "Optetrak RBK gives you the best of both worlds --- the benefits of a fixed and a mobile bearing knee in one unique system".
50 There are numerous references in the brochure to the acronym RBK without linking it to the Optetrak name.
The last page of the brochure states that the product is not available for sale in the United States.
51 On 17 March 2006 Orthotech, Exactech and Mr Scott-Young consented to interlocutory injunctive relief restraining the respondents from promoting, marketing and distributing a prosthetic knee under the name 'Optetrak RBK' or 'RBK' in the Australian market.


 Relationship between Global, Orthotech and Exactech 
 
 52 With effect from 1 January 2002, Global entered into a written distribution agreement with Orthotech for the distribution by Global of a range of orthopaedic products in New South Wales and the ACT.
The products included prostheses manufactured by Exactech and sold under the Optetrak brand name.
The products did not include the Optetrak RBK which had not yet been introduced in Australia.
53 Thus, from 1 January 2002 to September 2004, Global was promoting and distributing prosthetic knees for Orthotech and Exactech under the Optetrak brand, while at the same time promoting and selling the Global RBK under the name RBK Total Knee System.
54 There was also an earlier informal distribution arrangement between Global and Lima International Pty Limited, a related company of Orthotech, which dated back to July 1999.
55 In about early December 2001, Dr Albert Burstein, a director of Exactech, visited Australia and met with Mr Ribot.
The visit was partly social and partly business.
Mr Ribot showed Dr Burstein the Global RBK, and discussed manufacturing issues with him.
56 In July 2002, Global appointed Orthotech as the exclusive distributor in Queensland of Global's RBK.
Mr Ribot and Mr Banks traveled to Queensland and trained Orthotech staff on the Global RBK to enable them to distribute it.
However, that distributorship agreement lasted for only about two months and was brought to an end in early September 2002.
57 Whilst the distribution arrangements were on foot between Global and Orthotech, they had joint stands at AOA meetings and at some other industry events attended by orthopaedic surgeons where the range of Global and Orthotech products were displayed together.


 Trade Mark Applications 
 
 58 Global applied for registration of the acronym RBK as a trademark in Australia in September 2001.
However, the application was not pursued and Global allowed it to lapse.
59 In February 2005, Exactech applied for the registration of RBK as a trade mark in Australia.
The Trade Marks Office initially declined to accept the application stating that the RBK is a well known acronym for 'right below knee', that is to say, an amputation.
60 At the same time, Exactech also applied to register 'Rotating Bearing Knee' as a trade mark.
The Trade Marks Office declined to accept it upon the basis that those words are descriptive of rotating bearing knees.
61 Exactech has informed the Court that it will allow both of those trade mark applications in Australia to lapse.
62 Exactech has applied to register RBK as a trade mark in other countries.
In some, it has been rejected upon the basis that it is an acronym for right below knee.
63 In the United States, Exactech has applied for, and received acceptance of RBK as a trademark.
Dr Miller, the Executive Vice President, Research and Development of Exactech, swore a statement that:-
 "... no other person, firm corporation or association has the right to use the ... mark in commerce ... as may be likely, when applied to the goods of such other person, to cause confusion --- or to deceive.
" 
 
 64 Moreover, in prosecuting Exactech's US trade mark application, its attorney stated that:-
 "RBK --- has no significance in the relevant trade or industry, or as applied to the goods --- listed in the application, no geographical significance, nor any meaning in a foreign language".

 
 65 Global has filed an opposition to the registration of the mark in the USA.

 Prosthetic Knees 
 
 66 The need for a total knee replacement is most often the result of a patient's osteoarthritis.
A prosthetic knee seeks to replicate the normal planes of movement of the knee.
A normal knee moves in three separate planes, as follows:- 
 
 
 a. hinge movement, in which a person flexes or extends their leg, bent back or straightened out at the knee;
 b. rotating movement, such as when a person points their toe left or right; and
 c. gliding movement, in which the shin bone (the tibia) glides back and forward on the thigh bone (the femur) during flexion and extension.

 
 
 67 The design of prosthetic knees is usually 'tricompartmental'; it involves the implantation of a femoral component, a tibial component, and a plastic (polyethylene) component between them to allow movement without undue friction.
These components are implanted by cutting away some bone of the femur and tibia.
and are inserted with or without the use of orthopaedic bone cement, or are 'partly cemented'.
68 An additional variation occurs depending on the state of particular ligaments in the knee of the patient.
A prosthetic knee might be designed so as to be, firstly, 'cruciate retaining' (CR), where the posterior cruciate ligament is intact and functioning, and retained as part of the operation of the prosthesis.
Secondly, 'posterior stabilised' (PS) where there is no anterior or posterior cruciate ligament function.
And thirdly, 'condylar constrained' (CC) where there is compromised residual medial and lateral collateral ligament support.
69 Prosthetic knees come in a variety of forms, the two main categories being 'fixed bearing knees' and 'mobile bearing knees'.
The essential difference between these categories is the design of the tibial component, and the interface between the plastic component and the tibial base plate.
70 Prior to the development of mobile bearing knees, surgeons only implanted fixed bearing knees.
71 A fixed bearing knee can only flex and extend; it cannot rotate freely.
The plastic component is fixed fast to the tibial plate; there is no movement between the plastic component and the tibial base.
This design involves only one interface for wear within the prosthesis, so any forces which in a normal knee lead to gliding or rotational movement increases wear on the contact between the femoral component and the fixed plastic component.
72 Mobile bearing knees were devised around 25 years ago in New Jersey, USA.
A mobile bearing knee is able to rotate as well as flex and extend.
This is because in addition to an interface between the plastic component and the femoral component, there is an interface between the lower surface of the plastic component and the upper surface of the tibial component.
This allows gliding and rotation movements.
73 In a mobile bearing knee, the plastic component tends to be flat at the bottom where it sits on the tibial component.
Where it is connected with the femoral component, the plastic component is curved.
This increases the surface area of contact between the components, which reduces pressure on the bearing and within the device as a whole, reducing the most common form of wear in a knee implant.
74 Mobile bearing knees more closely replicate the normal planes of movement of the knee.
The design allows for freedom of movement in all planes, permits greater stability and enables less wear of the device, particularly the plastic component.
This latter feature increases the lifespan of the device.
75 Since the invention of the mobile bearing knee, there have been further refinements in the design and there are now several categories of mobile bearing knee.
76 It is uncontroversial that 'meniscal bearing knees' and 'rotating platform knees' are two such categories.
However, there is conflicting evidence as to whether a third form, rotating bearing knees, joins the other two as a generic category of prosthetic knee.
The respondents argue this to be so; initially, the applicant resisted such a suggestion, maintaining that it is a term peculiar to the applicant's product.
However, it seems to me that, ultimately, the effect of Global's case was to abandon its contention that rotating bearing knees are not a sub-class of mobile bearing knees.
In any event, the evidence satisfies me that they are.

 Market 
 
 77 The Australian market for the sale of prosthetic knees is very competitive.
78 The evidence indicates that approximately 80% of the Australian market is dominated by large companies such as DePuy, Smith  Nephew, and Zimmer, which supply orthopaedic products internationally.
Global and Exactech are amongst a few smaller, but successful companies in the market who compete for the remaining 20% of the market share.
79 The applicant has sold an average of 400 'RBK Total Knee Systems' each year since 2000; representing just over 2% of the total market for prosthetic knees.
Exactech's market share for the Optetrak RBK is even smaller; evidence from the respondents suggests that this is because it was only released in November 2005, but that it is expected that the market share will continue to grow.
Sales of the Optetrak RBK ceased in March 2006 when the interlocutory injunction was ordered.
80 In 2003-2004, there were more than 25,000 total knee replacement surgeries in Australia.
At a cost of approximately $10,000 per operation, including about $4,000 --- $7,000 for the knee prosthesis, the market for knee prostheses is worth approximately $100,000,000 --- $175,000,000 per annum.

 Marketing Prosthetic Knees 
 
 81 There are approximately 680 orthopaedic surgeons in Australia who perform total knee replacement operations, but of these, 250 are identified as "knee specialists" by the AOA.
It would appear that these specialists, numbering 250, carry out the bulk of total knee replacement operations in Australia.
82 Knee prostheses are selected by these orthopaedic surgeons.
Patients are normally not aware of the type of prosthesis a surgeon will purchase and implant.
In private hospitals, the choice of knee is entirely that of the particular surgeon; in some public hospitals, although the decision about which knee to use is made by the surgeon, prosthetics are supplied in larger volumes by way of a tender arrangement with a particular manufacturer or distributor and the surgeon uses a prosthesis under tender.
83 Marketing of the products is primarily through individual appointments involving an orthopaedic surgeon and a sales representative from an orthopaedic company.
Other ways that orthopaedic surgeons are exposed to advertising include the annual meeting of the AOA and professional development conferences run by the AOA, and in relevant journals, such as the Journal of Bone  Joint Surgery and the Journal of Arthroplasty.
84 Surgeons may also be exposed to different prosthetic knee products through smaller conferences, meetings and dinners arranged by a particular orthopaedic company, through advertising sent to them by post, and through word of mouth recommendations by other surgeons.
85 Factors which may influence whether a surgeon agrees to meet with a sales representative include firstly, the reputation of that company and the surgeon's opinion of the reliability and level of service of the company; secondly, the knowledge, training and reputation of the representative; thirdly, whether the representative is promoting an innovation in the market; and finally, whether the surgeon is satisfied with the products they currently use for total knee replacements.
86 When a sales representative meets with an orthopaedic surgeon, they will discuss the product with the surgeon and provide documents, such as guides to the use of the product.
The sales representative may detail the points of differentiation between the product and other products on the market, so the surgeon is kept up to date on competing products available.
87 There is evidence that surgeons routinely use a particular prosthetic knee product they consider best suits their technique and approach to total knee replacement surgery.
The core factors which a surgeon considers in determining which prosthetic knee to use include experience of that surgeon and/or colleagues with the product; the history of the product, and in particular whether it has needed frequent revisions after initial implantation.
The expertise and marketing skills of the sales representative may also come to bear, as does the surgeon's confidence in the company providing the product.
In addition, surgeons may be influenced by the local product support available for that prosthesis, which is usually provided directly by the sales representative.
88 For a surgeon, changing the preferred type of implant used is a significant and time consuming process; the sales representative is an active participant in the process, and it is not a decision which is undertaken lightly.
The surgeon needs to be confident about the product, and the complexity of the implantation procedure for each particular product means a surgeon may practice a new implantation on numerous occasions before attempting the procedure on a patient.
89 There is evidence that sales representatives are active participants in the process of a surgeon changing the type of implant they use.
It may be said that there is strong brand loyalty in the market.
90 One indication of the close relationship which develops between the surgeon and the sales representative is that the surgeon is usually on a first name basis with the representative.
Often, the surgeon makes direct contact with that sales representative to order a prosthesis, or for any questions after an implantation.

 Naming and Packaging Prosthetic Knee Products 
 
 91 It is clear from the evidence that it is common practice in the orthopaedic products industry to use acronyms to describe medical devices and medical terms.
Many types of prosthetic knee products comprise initials and three letter abbreviations, and it is common practice in the industry to refer to products by their initials.
