The statutory provisions that provide for the extension of term recognise the length of time taken for research and regulatory approval of the claimed products of such patents and the fact that this reduces the "effective life" of the patent.
2 The Commissioner of Patents, by her delegate the Deputy Commissioner of Patents, decided that an amendment should be made to the Register of Patents ('the Patents Register') to correct the extension of term of four patents ('the Pfizer patents') in the name of the applicants (collectively 'Pfizer') ( Re Pfizer Corporation (2005) 67 IPR 201).
