 
 1 In this proceeding, the applicant, Mr Anthony Patrick Spalla, seeks to set aside a settlement ("the settlement") entered into by the respondents.
The settlement relates to an earlier proceeding, VID 3203 of 2002 ("the primary proceeding"), and a related appeal, VID 83 of 2005 ("the appeal"), involving essentially the same persons.
In order to set aside the settlement, he seeks to have a Deed ("the Deed") also entered into by these persons set aside.
He seeks to do so on the basis that Mr Rambaldi, the liquidator of a company formerly controlled by him, executed the Deed in bad faith.
2 For the reasons I am about to give, I would dismiss Mr Spalla's application.
He has failed to show that Mr Rambaldi acted in bad faith in executing the Deed.
On the contrary, the evidence shows that Mr Rambaldi acted in good faith in his dealings with Mr Spalla and as Irlmond's liquidator.


 PARTIES 
 
 3 The applicant, Mr Spalla, controlled Irlmond Pty Ltd ("Irlmond"), prior to the appointment of receivers and managers and, ultimately, a liquidator.
Irlmond traded in motor cars under the name "Essendon Mitsubishi and North City Daewoo" ("Essendon Mitsubishi").
Mr Spalla also controlled a related company, APS Wholesale Pty Ltd ("APS"), which purchased new cars and acted as the wholesale company for the dealership.
4 St George Motor Finance Limited ("St George Motor Finance") and St George Wholesale Finance Pty Ltd ("St George Wholesale Finance") (collectively, with St George Motor Wholesale Pty Ltd, referred to as the "St George parties") provided finance for Irlmond and APS by way of a floor plan.
5 On 12 February 1999, the St George parties appointed Mr Andrew William Beck and Mr Andrew Stewart Home, both from Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu ("Deloittes"), to be the receivers and managers of the property of Irlmond and APS.
Messrs Beck and Home retired on 8 August 2003.
On 23 September 2003, Mr Simon Wallace-Smith, a partner at Deloittes, was appointed receiver and manager of Irlmond and APS in their place.
Deloittes and Messrs Beck, Home and Wallace-Smith will be referred to collectively as the "Deloitte parties".
6 Mr Guiseppe Michele Rambaldi, a partner at Pitcher Partners, was appointed liquidator of Irlmond on 7 February 2001.
He is sometimes referred to below as "the liquidator".


 HISTORICAL COURT PROCEEDINGS 
 
 7 In proceeding V 74 of 1999, Mr Spalla contested the appointment of Messrs Beck and Home as receivers and managers of the property of Irlmond and APS.
Finkelstein J held that their appointment was lawful: see Spalla v St George Wholesale Finance Pty Ltd [1999] FCA 513 (" Spalla (No 1) ").
In his reasons, his Honour addressed the question of whether Irlmond and APS were insolvent at the time receivers were appointed.
Mr Spalla contended that the companies were not insolvent at that time.
His Honour held, however, that "the fact that the companies were insolvent is an inescapable conclusion from the evidence": see Spalla (No 1) at [140].
8 Mr Spalla appealed against the decision of Finkelstein J to the Full Court.
The Full Court, which was constituted by Heerey, Sundberg and Weinberg JJ, upheld his Honour's decision: see Spalla v St George Wholesale Finance Pty Ltd [1999] FCA 1566 (" Spalla (No 2) ").
The Full Court held, amongst other things, that the primary judge was correct to find that Irlmond and APS were insolvent at the time receivers were appointed: see Spalla (No 2) at [61]-[70].
9 In proceeding V 7877 of 1999, St George Wholesale Finance unsuccessfully petitioned for a sequestration order against Mr Spalla based on an alleged failure to comply with a bankruptcy notice.
The notice claimed that Mr Spalla owed a debt pursuant to the judgment obtained in proceeding V 74 of 1999 before Finkelstein J.
Mr Spalla contested the sum specified.
In St George Wholesale Finance Pty Ltd v Spalla [2000] FCA 1094 at [40] - [41] , Heerey J concluded that "St George is not sure itself what is really owing under the judgment" and that "this proceeding amounts to an abuse of the procedures provided by the Act".
10 On 14 April 2000, Mr Spalla and Mr Andrew David Bentley Still (an accountant and company secretary of Irlmond and APS until 12 February 1999) were charged with 22 counts of dishonest false accounting in respect of their conduct at Irlmond.
There was a trial in the County Court of Victoria.
On 10 September 2002, the number of charges was reduced to four.
On 19 September 2002 a jury, by direction of Judge Hart, acquitted Mr Spalla and Mr Still.
In his ruling, his Honour said "[t]he evidence in support of the proposition that the accused acted only for the purpose of benefiting the company is overwhelming [and there] is no evidence which the Crown can point to which is inconsistent with this proposition".
11 A new proceeding, referred to above as the "primary proceeding", was filed in the Federal Court on 17 October 2002, shortly after Mr Spalla and Mr Still were acquitted of the criminal charges.
Irlmond joined the primary proceeding as an applicant.
On 6 May 2005, pursuant to the Deed that is the subject of this proceeding, Irlmond settled all of its claims in the primary proceeding and the appeal.
The procedural details and history of the primary proceeding are discussed in more detail in the Court's factual findings below.


 THIS PROCEEDING 
 
 12 On 18 May 2005, Mr Spalla filed a notice of motion in the primary proceeding seeking to set aside the Deed.
He filed an amended notice of motion on 30 May 2005.
On 22 June 2005, French J ordered that the notice of motion be treated as an application by way of originating process in a new proceeding.
Accordingly, this proceeding was allocated a separate file number (VID 631 of 2005).
On 18 April 2006, Mr Spalla filed a third further amended notice of motion with the leave of the Court.
13 In his third further amended notice of motion, Mr Spalla seeks the following relief:
 "1.

 2.
An Order that the Deed ... be set aside on the grounds of it being void ab initio.

An Order pursuant to section 236 (1) (a) (i) and 236 (2) of the Corporations Act 2001 that the Applicant be granted leave to intervene in proceedings No.
3203 of 2002 and Appeal No.
VID 83/05 for the purpose of taking responsibility on behalf of the company for those proceedings and in the company's name.

 5.B.
An Order pursuant to section 237 that an application for and granting leave for reasons purpose as defined in section 237 (a), (b), (c) and (d) be granted.

 EVIDENCE 
 
 15 Mr Spalla relied on affidavits (and exhibits) sworn on 18 May 2005, 20 June 2005, 5 July 2005, 22 July 2005 and 10 March 2006.
Mr Spalla also sought to rely on an affidavit sworn by him on 1 June 2005.
For reasons given during the hearing, I excluded that affidavit.
Mr Spalla also called Mr Phillip Frank Borden of Home Wilkinson and Lowry ("HWL") as a witness.
16 Both Mr Spalla and Mr Rambaldi gave oral evidence in chief and were cross-examined.
17 Mr Rambaldi and Irlmond also relied on an affidavit (and exhibits) sworn by Mr Rambaldi on 27 May 2005 and three affidavits sworn by him on 9 September 2005.
They also relied on an affidavit sworn by Mr David Raj Vasudevan of Pitcher Partners on 9 September 2005.
18 By consent, two unsworn statements of Ms April Arslan of HWL together with exhibits were admitted into evidence.
Further, an affidavit sworn by Mr Andrew Jonathan Fisher on 24 September 2003 and an exhibit thereto (both of which were filed in the primary proceeding) were tendered by Mr Spalla without objection.
There were a relatively small number of other documents admitted into evidence in the course of the trial.
19 The St George parties and the Deloitte parties did not present any evidence.
20 Unsurprisingly, given the subject matter of the present dispute, claims for legal professional privilege were raised from time to time.
For the most part, they were not pursued or they were waived.
Privilege was, however, claimed and pursued with respect to a relatively small group of documents, largely consisting of the written advices of counsel.
In relation to these documentary communications, the St George parties and the Deloitte parties voluntarily undertook not to seek access without leave of the Court and not to plead waiver of privilege by reason of events occurring at trial.
21 There was also an issue, particularly at the commencement of the trial, as to whether or in what circumstances evidence could be given of what happened at mediation on 29 April 2005.
This mediation was central to Mr Spalla's present application.
Ultimately, counsel for Irlmond and Mr Rambaldi specifically stated that they did not wish to take the point that evidence could or could not be adduced of statements at mediation.
Mr Spalla presented his case on the basis that any such evidence should be given.
The Deloitte parties and the St George parties did not argue for a different approach.
22 Section 53B of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) does not prevent the parties from adopting such a stance in this case, because there was no order made under this provision.
Section 53B(a) provides that "[e]vidence of anything said, or of any admission made, at a conference conducted by a mediator in the course of mediating anything referred under section 53A is not admissible ... in any court".
Section 53A(1) provides that the Court "may by order refer the proceedings ... to a mediator.
" At the commencement of the trial, the parties expressed uncertainty as to whether mediation in this case was pursuant to Court order or simply pursuant to agreement between them.
A thorough review of the files and relevant transcripts from the primary proceeding and the appeals (VID 3203 of 2002, VID 54 of 2005 and VID 83 of 2005) establishes that the Court in fact made no order referring the proceeding to mediation, although it gave encouragement to the parties to do so.
23 On 14 February 2005, Black CJ ordered (in both appeals) that the matters be referred to a judge of the Court for directions concerning possible mediation.
The matters subsequently came before North J for directions on 16 March 2005 and 21 March 2005.
At the directions hearing on 16 March 2005, his Honour discussed the utility of mediation with the parties, without ordering a referral to mediation.
His Honour simply ordered that the matter be stood over for mention, if necessary, on 21 March 2005 and reserved costs.
On 21 March 2005, his Honour inquired of the parties whether they had agreed upon the identity of a mediator and, when informed they had not, ordered that the matter be stood down to a date to be fixed and reserved costs.
As it happened, the parties ultimately agreed upon the identity of a mediator and proceeded to mediation pursuant to a mediation agreement.
None of the parties to this agreement relied on its terms in connection with the evidence given or sought to be given about the mediation or any related matter.
24 Further, s 131 of the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth) does not prevent the parties to the present proceeding from giving evidence about the mediation.
Subject to s 131(2) , s 131(1) prevents parties to litigation from adducing evidence of "a communication ... between persons in dispute ... in connection with an attempt to negotiate a settlement of the dispute".
Counsel for Mr Rambaldi submitted that s 131 did not in fact apply to communications between Mr Spalla and Mr Rambaldi, because they were not "persons in dispute" for the purposes of s 131(1).
I accept this submission.
No-one submitted to the contrary.
At the time of the mediation, Mr Spalla and Mr Rambaldi were not in dispute.
Furthermore, neither of them was in dispute with Mr Borden, Ms Arslan or Mr Bowman.
25 Further, neither the Deloitte parties nor the St George parties submit that evidence of communications at the mediation between them and the applicants in the primary proceeding should not be given.
Section 131(1) does not prevent evidence being given in this case of communications with the Deloitte parties and the St George parties and Mr Rambaldi, Mr Spalla, Mr Borden, Ms Arslan or Mr Bowman, even if they were parties in dispute for relevant purposes.
This is because s 131(2) provides that s 131(1) does not apply if, amongst other things, "the persons in dispute consent to the evidence being adduced in the proceeding concerned"; "the evidence tends to contradict or to qualify evidence that has already been admitted about the course of an attempt to settle the dispute"; "the proceeding in which it is sought to adduce the evidence is ... a proceeding in which the making of such an agreement is in issue"; or "making the communication ... affects a right of a person": see s 131(2)(a) , (e), (f) and (i).
In the circumstances of this case, these provisions operate to take out of the reach of s 131(1) , evidence of any communication that might otherwise fall within this provision.
26 Finally, whatever confidentiality once pertained to the Litigation Funding Agreement, discussed below, was lost by the time of the trial.



 FACTUAL FINDINGS 
 
 The commencement of the primary proceeding and joinder of Irlmond 
 
 27 The primary proceeding began on 17 October 2002, when Still  Co filed the original application and statement of claim on behalf of the then applicants.
Those applicants were Mr Spalla and his wife, Stella, Mr Still, and Anstella Nominees Pty Ltd ("Anstella") as the holder of all shares in Irlmond and APS.
Irlmond was not one of the original parties to the primary proceeding.
The original respondents included St George Motor Finance, St George Wholesale Finance, Messrs Beck and Home, and Deloittes.
By their original statement of claim, the applicants alleged that the respondents had given false evidence in the proceeding before Finkelstein J and raised various claims relating to the receivership of Irlmond and APS.
The applicants also claimed that the respondents had conspired wrongly to subject Mr Spalla and Mr Still to criminal conspiracy charges.
28 Prior to May 2003, Mr Rambaldi retained the firm of Darrer Muir Fleiter to advise him with respect to the primary proceeding and, in particular, as to Irlmond's prospects if it were to join in the proceeding.
On 22 November 2002, Mr Rambaldi sought quotations for insurance litigation funding.
In a facsimile dated 3 February 2003, Mr Rambaldi's solicitors subsequently wrote to Mr Spalla's solicitors stating that, as liquidator of Irlmond, Mr Rambaldi was not in a position to join in the primary proceeding, or institute his own proceeding, until he had entered into an acceptable funding arrangement, although Mr Rambaldi had "his own legal advice that various claims against the Respondents, or a combination of them are likely to be successful".
29 Throughout February and March 2003, Mr Rambaldi, assisted by Mr Vasudevan negotiated with IMF (Australia) Ltd ("IMF"), represented by Mr Clive Bowman, to secure litigation funding and, in particular, concerning the terms of a litigation funding agreement, which Mr Rambaldi required before agreeing to Irlmond becoming an applicant in the primary proceeding.
The contemporaneous correspondence shows that control of the litigation was an important issue.
By a letter dated 6 March 2003, IMF specifically noted that it wanted to avoid "Spalla attempting to block, or interfere with, a settlement which Irlmond wishes to pursue".
It reiterated this concern in an email of 29 April 2003.
Ultimately, a funding agreement was reached with Insolvency Litigation Fund Pty Ltd ("ILF"), a wholly owned subsidiary of IMF.
Before concluding the funding agreement, Mr Spalla retained the services of Mr Borden to act on his behalf in place of Still  Co. 
 30 By motion, notice of which was dated 2 May 2003, Mr Rambaldi applied for leave from the Court to enter into the proposed funding agreement ("proposed funding agreement"), to which the applicants to the primary proceeding and ILF were to be parties.
He also sought leave for Irlmond to join the primary proceeding.
In his supporting affidavit, he deposed that, in the absence of the funding agreement, Irlmond could not join the proceeding since it would not have the funds to do so.
31 The draft funding agreement included the following provisions: 

 "1.1 Definitions 
 
 
 ... 
 
 
 
 "Irlmond claim" means the claim(s) prosecuted in the Proceeding by Irlmond as referred to in Clause B of this Agreement.

 
 ... 
 
 "Settlement Offer" means an offer by the Respondents or any one or more of them to settle the Liquidator and/or Irlmond's claims in the Proceeding or to settle the Liquidator and/or Irlmond's claims and/or the Spalla Interests claims in the Proceeding; 
 
 "Solicitors" means Home Wilkinson Lowry or such other firm of solicitors retained to act for the Liquidator and Irlmond from time to time; and 
 
 "Spalla Interests" means Anstella, Anthony Patrick Spalla, Stella Marie Spalla and Andrew David Bentley Still.

 
 "Spalla Interests claim" means the claim(s) prosecuted in the Proceeding by the Spalla Interests as referred to in Clause B of this Agreement.
" 
 
 ... 
 
 
 9.
CONTROL OF THE PROCEEDINGS 
 
 9.1.
The Spalla Interests and the Liquidator agree that the Solicitors shall, after Court approval, conduct the Proceeding on behalf of the Liquidator and the Spalla Interests.

 
 9.2 The Solicitors shall at all times be instructed by the Liquidator in respect of the Irlmond claim and subject to clause 9.3, the Spalla Interests will not interfere with the conduct of the Proceeding by the Liquidator in respect of the Irlmond claim.

 
 9.3 Notwithstanding clauses 9.1 and 9.2, the Liquidator shall not instruct the Solicitors to:- 
 
 (a) settle or discontinue the Proceeding as a whole; or 
 
 
 
 
 (b) settle, amend, vary, abandon or discontinue any claim made or the relief sought by the Spalla Interests, or any one or more of them; 
 
 
 
 
 
 unless the instruction to the Solicitors is agreed to by both the Spalla Interests and the Liquidator.
The provisions of clause 13 shall apply to this clause if the liquidator and the Spalla Interests do not agree to so instruct the solicitors.

 
 9.4 ILF shall not at any time interfere with the conduct of the Proceeding by the Liquidator or the Spalla Interests.

 
 ... 
 
 13.
ARBITRATION 
 
 13.1 On written notice to the other parties, any party hereto may request that an independent third party arbitrator be appointed to adjudicate any matter in dispute and may nominate an Arbitrator ... 
 
 13.5 The Arbitrator's written determination shall be binding on the parties ... 
 
 14.
SETTLEMENTS 
 
 14.1 If a Settlement Offer is received from the Respondents or any one or more of them or if the Applicants or any one or more of them wish to make an offer to settle and either: 
 
 
 
 
 
 (a) the Spalla Interests and the Liquidator cannot agree on accepting the terms of the Settlement Offer; or 
 
 (b) the Settlement Offer relates only to the Liquidator and/or Irlmond's claims in the Proceedings and the Spalla Interests disagree with the Liquidator and/or Irlmond's intention to accept the Settlement Offer and the Liquidator's/Irlmond's intention has been communicated to the Spalla Interests in a written document referring to this clause; or 
 
 (c) the Spalla Interests or the Liquidator cannot agree to the terms of an offer to be put to the Respondents to settle the Proceedings.

 
 
 
 
 then any party may: 
 
 
 
 
 (i) on written notice to the other parties, request that an independent third party arbitrator be appointed to adjudicate on the Settlement Offer or offer to settle and may nominate an Arbitrator ... 
 
 


 
 
 
 (iv) the Arbitrator shall make a written determination on whether the Settlement Offer or offer for settlement is reasonable having regard only to the legal issues involved in the Proceeding; ... 
 
 (v) the Arbitrator's written determination shall be binding on the parties; ... 
 
 


 
 
 14.2 Upon receipt of the Arbitrator's written determination, the parties shall be authorised to accept or reject the Settlement Offer or to put the offer of settlement and shall instruct the Solicitors, Senior Counsel and Junior Counsel accordingly.
" 
 


 
 (Hereafter the expression "Spalla Interests" refers to Anstella, Mr and Mrs Spalla, and Mr Still.
)
 32 At the hearing of the motion on 8 May 2003, Finkelstein J allowed Mr Iain Jones, as counsel for two of the St George parties in their capacity as creditors of Irlmond, to appear and make submissions.
Mr Jones argued that the agreement, as then drafted, improperly limited the liquidator's discretion to settle claims on behalf of Irlmond.
Mr Jones noted that clauses 13 and 14 of the proposed funding agreement allowed the Spalla Interests to object to the liquidator accepting a settlement offer made only to Irlmond and, in the event of such an objection, delegated to an arbitrator the decision whether to accept such an offer.
Mr Jones claimed that this arrangement was an unlawful restraint on the liquidator's discretion.
His Honour said that it appeared that Mr Jones was correct on this point.
Mr Jones also argued that the proposed funding agreement --- which allowed ILF to withdraw at any time on seven days' notice but still take part in a distribution of any recovery --- gave ILF a potential windfall if it withdrew shortly after executing the agreement.
33 After the hearing of 8 May 2006, the parties to the proposed funding agreement negotiated further, in order to amend it so as to meet the concerns expressed by Finkelstein J.
In particular, as part of these further negotiations, the parties considered the issue of control over any settlement offer to Irlmond and the issue of ILF getting a 'windfall' if it withdrew its indemnity shortly after executing the agreement.
They prepared a new draft funding agreement.
On 12 May 2003, Mr Rambaldi filed this new draft in the Court, together with counsel's supplementary submission in support of the new agreement.
34 This supplementary submission stated that the amendments to the proposed funding agreement "address the criticisms made by Mr Jones".
It continued:
 "The effect of the amendments is to: 
 
 
 (a) remove any restriction on the power of the liquidator to accept a settlement offer made to the company.
No limitations are imposed upon the liquidator at all in this regard; 
 (b) in the event that ILF terminates its indemnity pursuant to clause 6.2, to restrict the entitlement of ILF to the "Recovery" to simply a reimbursement of monies it has paid pursuant to clause 6.2.
" 
 
 
 35 The new agreement deleted the former clauses 13 and 14 from the earlier draft.
Clause 9, relating to control of the proceedings, was unchanged except "clause 14" was substituted for the words "clause 13" in clause 9.3.
A new clause 13 dealt with "Recoveries".
A new clause 14 relevantly read: 

 "14.
DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEDURE 
 
 
 14.1 If at any time, a dispute or difference arises in connection with this Agreement and that dispute or difference has not been able to be resolved by negotiations between the parties then a party may provide the other parties with a written notice addressed to the other parties outlining the dispute or difference, and if capable of remedy, requiring remedy on the expiry of 3 Business Days from receipt of the written notice.

 
 
 
 
 
 14.2 If the dispute or difference communicated to the other parties by written notice is not remedied or is not capable of remedy, then the parties agree to submit to mediation prior to the institution of Court proceedings utilising the following procedure:- 
 
 
 
 
 (a) The parties shall jointly appoint a mediator.
If the parties cannot agree on a mediator within 2 Business Days of receipt of the written notice by the other parties, the parties agree that any one or more of the parties may request the President for the time being of the Law Institute of Victoria to nominate a mediator.

 
 (b) The costs and expenses plus any GST payable to the mediator and the costs and expenses of the mediation shall be paid by Anstella.

 
 (c) If a settlement is reached at the mediation, written terms of settlement shall be entered into immediately upon conclusion of the mediation and shall, unless Court approval of the terms of settlement is required, override the terms and conditions of this Agreement.
..." 
 
 
 
 36 On 14 May 2003, Finkelstein J delivered reasons for judgment giving approval to Mr Rambaldi as liquidator of Irlmond to enter into the funding agreement in the form attached to his counsel's supplementary submission of 12 May 2003: see Anstella Nominees Pty Ltd v St George Motor Finance Ltd [2003] FCA 466 (" Anstella ").
His Honour wrote (at [5]-[8]):
 "The initial version of the draft agreement required the liquidator to surrender his power to control the destiny of the action in the event of disagreement between the liquidator and the other applicants concerning the settlement or discontinuance of the action.
The draft agreement provided that the liquidator could not instruct his solicitors to settle or discontinue the proceeding without obtaining the consent of the other applicants.
If there was a dispute, the matter had to go to arbitration.
... 
 It seemed to me ... that the proposal gave rise to a ... difficulty, namely whether there are any circumstances under which a liquidator can lawfully give up his statutory powers or duties.
There is a view that, while a liquidator may listen to the opinion of others on what steps he should take in a particular situation, in the end he must exercise his own judgment on what is or is not in the best interests of the creditors or contributories.
For this reason he cannot give up control of litigation in which his company is a party.
This is the view taken by Lightman J in Grovewood Holdings Plc v James Capel  Co Ltd [1995] Ch 80.
... 
 Recognising the potential difficulty he was in, the liquidator sought time to see whether Insolvency Litigation Fund Pty Ltd ("ILF") (the company providing the funding) could be persuaded to change the terms.
This is in fact what occurred.
The liquidator was able to negotiate the removal of the restriction on his ability to settle or discontinue the proceeding if Irlmond became a party to the action.
" 
 37 On 15 May 2003, the litigation funding agreement (hereafter referred to as "the LFA") was executed by Mr and Mrs Spalla, Mr Still, Anstella, Mr Rambaldi, Irlmond, and ILF.
