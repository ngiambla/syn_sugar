 
 (Second court hearing) 
 
 1 The plaintiff ("WCG") applies under s 411(6) of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) ("the Act ") for an order approving a scheme of arrangement between WCG and its members ("the Scheme").
The first court hearing took place on 14 July 2006 (see WebCentral Group Limited, in the matter of WebCentral Group Limited [2006] FCA 937).
I then made an order under s 411(1) of the Act that WCG convene a meeting ("Scheme Meeting") of its shareholders ("WebCentral Shareholders") for the purpose of their considering, and, if thought fit, agreeing (with or without modification) to the Scheme.


2 On the second court hearing on 25 August 2006, I made the attached orders approving the Scheme.
The following are my reasons for the making of those orders.

 3 The nature of the Scheme was described in my earlier Reasons for Judgment.
The Scheme provides for the acquisition of all of the issued shares in WCG by Melbourne IT Ltd ("MLB").
4 The Scheme Meeting was held on 21 August 2006 in accordance with the orders of 14 July 2006.
A total of 32,274,813 votes were cast.
Of these, 32,041,443 votes (99.28% of all votes cast) representing 321 shareholders (93.31% of WebCentral Shareholders) favoured agreeing to the Scheme, 233,370 votes (0.72% of all votes cast) representing 23 shareholders (6.69% of all WebCentral Shareholders) were cast against the motion to agree to it, and no "abstain" votes were recorded on the motion.
Accordingly, the motion was passed by the majority referred to in s 411(4)(a) of the Act .
5 There was in evidence a letter dated 24 August 2006 from the Australian Securities and Investments Commission ("ASIC") advising that under para 411(17)(b) of the Act , ASIC had no objection to the Scheme, and did not propose to appear to make submissions, or to intervene to oppose the Scheme.
6 Only three matters call for special mention in these reasons: first, a competing "indicative proposal" that was put to WCG on behalf of NetRegistry Pty Ltd ("NetRegistry"); secondly, the "no encumbrances issue" to which I referred at [13]---[16] of my earlier reasons; and thirdly, the form of order proposed.

 NetRegistry's competing indicative proposal 
 
7 While the proposal for the Scheme was in train, Sydney Capital Partners, on behalf of its client, NetRegistry, advised that NetRegistry was interested in making an offer for the business of, or shares in, WCG.
NetRegistry was, of course, aware of the proposal by MLB which had received the support of WCG's board of directors.

 8 NetRegistry indicated the possibility of an offer of $1.65 per share, payable in cash, contingent on a number of conditions precedent being satisfied, including confirmation of funding.
The facts relating to the NetRegistry approach are conveyed in detail in an affidavit sworn on 24 August 2006 of Grant Chamberlain, Director and Deputy Head of Mergers and Acquisitions, Deutsche Bank AG, which had been retained by WCG to advise it in relation to the Scheme, and in the documents constituting the Exhibit to Mr Chamberlain's affidavit.
9 The initial approach by NetRegistry was in a face to face meeting on 14 July 2006.
This was followed by a letter dated 18 July 2006 from Sydney Capital Partners.
10 The directors of WCG did not regard NetRegistry's indicative proposal as constituting a material change of circumstances in relation to the Scheme or as enlivening WCG's continuing disclosure of obligation.
However, because of rumours in relation to NetRegistry's indicative proposal, on Wednesday 16 August 2006 WCG announced to the Australian Stock Exchange ("ASX") the approach from NetRegistry.
The announcement referred to the "unsolicited indicative proposal" that had been made to WCG on behalf of NetRegistry and set out reasons why the board of directors of WCG had determined that the interests of WebCentral Shareholders would be better served by the board's continuing to pursue the well advanced proposed merger with MLB.
The ASX notice stated that NetRegistry's proposal was conditional and at an early stage of development, and did not yet represent an offer capable of acceptance.
11 Subsequently, NetRegistry expressed its disappointment over the decision of WCG's board not to pursue discussions with NetRegistry.
As well, NetRegistry issued a press release disagreeing with certain aspects of WCG's ASX announcement.
12 If the board of WCG had "stalled" the MLB proposal in the hope of grasping an offer from NetRegistry, WCG may have released the MLB "bird in the hand" and finished up with nothing.
It was a business judgment for the directors of WCG whether to run that risk.
13 The conditional approach from NetRegistry and the WCG board's decision to proceed with the Scheme Meeting on 21 August 2006 notwithstanding it, are not reasons why the Court should withhold its approval of the Scheme.

 The "no encumbrances" issue 
 
14 In relation to the "no encumbrances issue", I have decided to follow the course allowed by s 411(6) of the Act of approving the Scheme subject to the alteration of the Scheme, by the deletion of clause 9.3(b) (and the re-lettering of clause 9.3(c) as clause 9.3(b)).
As noted in my earlier Reasons for Judgment at [15], this was an alternative course which Mr M B Oakes, senior counsel for WCG, suggested if the course which he primarily supported, namely, that of the Court's approving the Scheme containing clause 9.3(b), should not find favour.

 15 Clause 9.3(b) was set out at [13] of my earlier reasons and is as follows:
 "The Scheme Shares transferred to MLB under the Scheme will be transferred free from all mortgages, charges, liens, encumbrances, pledges, security interests and other interests of third parties of any kind, whether legal or otherwise, that will bind MLB.
" 
 

16 Mr Oakes made a detailed written submission in favour of approval of the Scheme containing this clause.
