 
1 Sometimes in a workplace an employer and its employees, through their representative union, will be at odds about the correct interpretation of an award provision.
This is such a case.
It raises for determination whether certain members of the applicant, Australian Nursing Federation, have been incorrectly paid by their employers for work performed on Monday 27 December 2004, Tuesday 28 December 2004 and Monday 3 January 2005.
2 The second respondent, Ellfam Nominees Pty Ltd, is the operator of Aged Care Facilities at Bendigo and Ballarat.
At all material times it employed Kevin Wright, Ellen Lea and Kaye Young as Registered Nurses Division 2 (State Enrolled Nurses).
The Ellfam employees 
 
3 Ellfam engaged these employees to work in services that operated other than only on a Monday to Friday basis.
4 Kevin Wright did not work on Monday 27 December 2004 and did not receive pay in respect of that day.
He worked on Tuesday 28 December 2004 and Monday 3 January 2005, but did not receive public holiday rates.
5 Ellen Lea's circumstances in respect of the relevant three days were materially indistinguishable from those of Kevin Wright.
Kaye Young worked on each relevant day but did not receive public holiday rates.
6 Kevin Wright did not work on Saturday 25 December 2004 or Sunday 26 December 2004 but was paid for those days at public holiday rates.
He did work on Saturday 1 January 2005 and was paid for that day at the appropriate public holiday rate.
Ellen Lea's circumstances were the same as that of Kevin Wright in the above regard.
Kaye Young did not work on Saturday 25 December 2004, Sunday 26 December 2004 or Saturday 1 January 2005.
She normally did not work on a Friday or a weekend day.
Those three days were weekend days.
Kaye Young did not receive any payment for those days.
7 ANF contends that Ellfam should have paid Kevin Wright, Ellen Lea and Kaye Young for work performed by them on Monday 27 December 2004, Tuesday 28 December 2004 and Monday 3 January 2005 at public holiday rates.
The notice 
 
8 Ms Marsha Thomson, Minister for Small Business for the State of Victoria, published a notice under ss 7 and 8 of the Public Holidays Act 1993 (Vic) in the Victorian Government Gazette of 12 November 2004.
So far as is material, the notice declared that 25 December 2004 was not a public holiday but that 27 December 2004, 28 December 2004 and 3 January 2005 were to be public holidays.
The award 
 
9 ANF alleges that the entitlement of the three Ellfam employees to be paid at public holiday rates for the three days in question arises from cl 24 of the Nurses (Victorian Health Services) Award 2000.

 
10 The Award applies to the employment of Registered Nurses, State Enrolled Nurses and Mothercraft Nurses in the State of Victoria, other than those employed in the public service of the State; see cl 4 of the Award.
11 Clause 24 of the Award is headed "PUBLIC HOLIDAYS".
