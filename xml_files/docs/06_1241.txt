 
1 The respondent is responsible for the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity throughout Western Australia.
The main transition network is in the south-west of the State centred on Perth.
It is known as the South West Interconnected System ('the SWIS').
In 2002 the respondent embarked upon a tender process for the purpose of procuring additional generating capacity for the SWIS.
This tender process was conducted pursuant to the Electricity Corporation Act 1994 (WA), which requires the respondent to procure substantial new generating capacity through a non discriminatory and open public procurement process ('PPP').
2 There were two stages to the PPP for the SWIS.
This case is concerned with the second stage of the PPP.
3 Under the first stage the respondent sought a procurement of approximately 240MW of generating capacity for the SWIS by late 2005.
4 In December 2002, the respondent launched Stage 2 of the PPP which was for the procurement for 300MW to 330MW of new generating capacity for the SWIS.
The applicants submitted a tender to build, own and operate a coal-fired power station which was capable of generating at least 300MW to 330MW constantly on a sent-out basis.
On 16 August 2005 the respondent announced that the tender had been awarded to another tenderer, Wambo Power Ventures Pty Ltd ('Wambo').
5 The applicants have seen documents relating to the obtaining of environmental approvals from the Minister for the Environment for Wambo's power station which caused them to believe that there was a substantial difference in the proposed power station that was the subject of the applicants' tender and the proposed power station that was the subject of Wambo's winning tender.
The applicants say that, whereas the applicants' proposed power station had a baseload capacity of at least 300MW to 330MW, Wambo's proposed power station did not.
It, they say, had a baseload capacity of 240MW and it could only generate 320MW of power by generating a further 80MW of power through the operation of a gas-fired duct booster system, which because of the conditions imposed by the Minister for the Environment, could only operate 15 per cent of the time.
6 On the basis of the information presently available to them, the applicants believe that they submitted a tender which complied with the respondent's bid requirements, but the requirements that the successful bidder had to meet were different from those imposed on them, or that the respondent did not apply the requirements it said it would apply in awarding the tender to the successful bidder.
The applicants believe that, acting in reliance on the information supplied by the respondent, they proposed a more expensive power station than that proposed by Wambo, and this would have disadvantaged them in the tender process.
7 At the heart of the applicants' complaint is the distinction between a 'baseload' plant and a 'peaking' plant.
In simple terms, the applicants say that the respondent called for tenders for a 300MW to 330MW baseload plant which was required to meet prescribed environmental standards, and, it appears, that the respondent awarded the tender to a plant with a 240MW baseload capacity and a 80MW peaking capacity, which did not meet the prescribed environmental standards.
8 Accordingly, the applicants believe that they may be able to bring legal proceedings against the respondent.
The applicants, therefore, seek relief under O 15A r 6 of the Federal Court Rules ('the Rules') to enable them to decide whether to take legal action against the respondent.
9 The applicants seek orders that the respondent produce such of the following documents as are in its possession custody or power:
 
 '(a) any document recording or evidencing an invitation made by the respondent between 2004 to 2005 to Wambo Power Ventures Pty Ltd ( Wambo ) to submit a bid or proposal to construct a new electricity power station in the South West Integrated System; 
 
 (b) any bid proposal, submission or presentation ( Proposal ) from Wambo to the respondent, or any documents which record or evidence the content of any such Proposal relating to the construction of a new electricity power station in the South West Integrated System during the period 20 December 2002 to date; 
 
 
 
 (c) any document recording or evidencing any contract, arrangement or understanding entered into by the first respondent and Wambo relating to the construction of a new electricity power station in the South West Integrated System during the period 20 December 2002 to date.
' (original emphasis) 
 
 

 Order 15A r 6 of the Federal Court Rules 
 
10 Order 15A r 6 of the Rules provides:
 
 'Where: 
 
 
 (a) there is reasonable cause to believe that the applicant has or may have the right to obtain relief in the Court from a person whose description has been ascertained; 
 
 
 
 (b) after making all reasonable inquiries, the applicant has not sufficient information to enable a decision to be made whether to commence a proceeding in the Court to obtain that relief; and 
 
 (c) there is reasonable cause to believe that that person has or is likely to have or has had or is likely to have had possession of any document relating to the question whether the applicant has the right to obtain the relief and that inspection of the document by the applicant would assist in making the decision - 
 
 
 the Court may order that that person shall make discovery to the applicant of any document of the kind described in paragraph (c).
' 
 

11 The respondent opposed the application on two grounds.
Firstly, that the applicants were unable to satisfy the O 15A r 6(a); and, secondly, on the basis that the Court should in any event, as a matter of discretion, refuse to grant relief.
There was no issue between the parties in relation to whether the applicant had fulfilled the requirements set out in O 15A r 6(b) and O 15A r 6(c) of the Rules.
Did the applicants satisfy O 15A r 6(a) of the Federal Court Rules ?

 
12 There was no dispute between the parties as to the principles to be applied in determining whether the applicants have satisfied O 15A r 6(a).
Both counsel referred to the observations of Hely J in St George Bank Limited v Rabo Australia Limited (2004) 211 ALR 147 at 153-154 ('Rabo') to the following effect:
 
 '... 
 
 
 (c) the test for determining whether the applicant has "reasonable cause to believe", as required by sub-paragraph (a), is an objective one; ... 
 
 (d) belief requires more than mere assertion and more than suspicion or conjecture.
Belief is an inclination of the mind towards assenting to, rather than rejecting a proposition.
Thus it is not sufficient to point to a mere possibility.
The evidence must incline the mind towards the matter or fact in question.
If there is no reasonable cause to believe that one of the necessary elements of a potential cause of action exists, that would dispose of the application insofar as it is based on that cause of action:... 
 
 
 
 (e) whilst uncertainty as to only one element of a cause of action might be compatible with the "reasonable cause to believe" required by sub-paragraph (a), uncertainty as to the number of such elements may be sufficient to undermine the reasonableness of the cause to believe; 
 
 
 ...' 
 
 

13 Senior counsel for the applicants identified two main potential causes of action, namely, a contravention of s 52 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) ('the TP Act') and breach of contract.
As to the contravention of the TP Act, senior counsel contended that a cause of action could be founded upon the respondent having made the following representation:
 
 'the respondent would only consider tenders that provided for a generated capacity of at least 300 megawatts to 330 megawatts constantly provided on a sent-out basis and which tenders satisfied the minimum environmental conditions specified in the tender documents.
' 
 

14 Senior counsel also identified another potential representation, namely, that the respondent would, in assessing the tenders, determine the successful tenderer applying criteria that were uniform to all.
Senior counsel relied upon Hughes Aircraft Systems International v Civil Aviation Authority (1995) 217 ALR 303 to contend that there was a potential claim in contract based upon an implied contract that the respondent would apply the same requirements to all tenders.
Senior counsel for the applicants also referred to, but did not elaborate upon, other potential causes of action in common law, namely, an action based upon an estoppel in respect of wasted expenditure and an action on the basis of monies had and received in respect of expenditure incurred on the preparation of the tender.
15 Before referring to the evidence, it is convenient to identify the four stages involved in the bid process.
16 During the first stage the parties submitted their expressions of interest to the respondent.
The stage lasted from 20 December 2002 to 2 May 2003, and resulted in the respondent nominating some parties as qualified to proceed to the next stage.
17 The second stage was referred to as the 'Request for Proposal' ('RFP') stage.
It occurred when those qualified parties considered whether to submit a non-binding proposal in response to a request for a proposal issued by the respondent.
The qualified parties were required to submit their non-binding proposals by 6 August 2004.
On that date the applicants submitted a non-binding proposal for a coal-fired power station.
By reason of a Bid Agreement subsequently entered into with the respondent, the applicants were required to adhere in its final binding proposal to the choice of fuel for the power station that it had nominated in its non-binding proposal.
18 The third stage was the stage during which the limited number of parties that were invited to do so, compiled and submitted their final bids to the respondent and the respondent considered and announced the preferred bidder.
The final bids were lodged on 22 July 2005.
The applicants' final bid proposed a coal-fired power station.
In August 2005 the respondent announced that Wambo was the preferred bidder.
19 The final stage was the negotiation of project agreements with the preferred bidder.
20 The applicants relied upon the affidavits of Wayne Richard Trumble affirmed on 22 November 2005, 8 March 2006 and 3 April 2006.
The respondent relied upon the affidavits of Baden Furphy dated 7 April 2006 and Trevor Stanley Harvey sworn on 22 February 2006 and 30 March 2006.
Mr Trumble was responsible for the preparation and submission of the tender on behalf of the applicants.
Mr Harvey is an employee of the respondent and holds the position of Manager, Power Procurement.
None of Mr Trumble, Mr Furphy or Mr Harvey was cross-examined.
Mr Trumble's evidence 
 
21 In his affidavit of 22 November 2005, Mr Trumble identifies information from the respondent which led him to believe that the respondent required the proposed power station to have a baseload generating capacity of between 300MW to 330MW of power; or putting it another way, to be capable of generating 300MW to 330MW of power on a constantly sent-out basis; and to meet prescribed environmental standards.
22 Firstly, Mr Trumble identified a number of documents issued by the respondent entitled 'Process Update' dated 7 June 2002, 1 July 2002, 20 December 2002, 26 February 2003 and 31 March 2004 respectively.
The author of each of these documents was Mr Trevor Harvey.
23 Process Update No 2 is dated 7 June 2002 and reads:
 
 '... [the respondent] has launched the public procurement process for approximately 240 MW peaking generation capacity for the South West Interconnected System (SWIS) by late 2005.

 
 The Minister for Energy Hon.
Eric Ripper announced this first stage of power procurement on 2 June 2002, as part of a generation strategy including both the public procurement of additional capacity in two stages and the replacement of ageing units in [the respondent's] existing portfolio.

 
 ... 
 
 A second stage of the power procurement process, which is to procure approximately 300 MW of baseload generation capacity by late 2007, is expected to commence in late 2002.
No further information covering the second stage is yet available.
' 
 

24 Process Update No 5 is dated 1 July 2002 and reads:
 
 '.... 
 
 EXPRESSION OF INTEREST UPDATE 
 
 [The respondent] received 26 expressions of interest from companies with local, national and international operations to provide around 240 megawatts of new peaking capacity to meet the growing electricity demand in the South West Interconnected System.

 
 ... 
 
 The second stage of power procurement, to obtain additional baseload generating capacity, is expected to begin later in 2002 and to be in operation by 2007/08.
' 
 

25 Process Update No 12 is dated 20 December 2002 and reads:
 
 ' SWIS POWER PROCUREMENT 
 STAGE 2 
 
 LAUNCH OF STAGE 2 
 
 The Minister for Energy Hon.
Eric Ripper announced in June 2002 two stages of public power procurement.
The first stage is now in the Final Bid Phase.

 
 [The respondent] has today launched the second stage of the public procurement process, for the acquisition of 300 MW to 330 MW of baseload capacity for the South West Interconnected System (SWIS) to be in service from 2007.

 
 ... 
 
 Lodgement of expressions of interest close at 10:00 am WST on Wednesday, 26 February 2003.
' 
 

26 Process Update No 13 is dated 26 February 2003 and reads:
 
 ' EXPRESSION OF INTEREST UPDATE 
 
 [The respondent] has received 13 expressions of interest for Stage 2 of the Power Procurement Process from companies with local, national and international operations to provide around 300 megawatts of new baseload capacity to meet the growing electricity demand in the South West Interconnected System.

 
 Expressions of interest are to be evaluated and those Respondents that qualify will, in due course, be asked to submit indicative bids.
A short-list of bidders will later be asked to submit binding bids.

 
 This stage of the Process is to obtain additional baseload generating capacity to be in operation by 2007/08.
' 
 

27 Process Update No 19 is dated 31 March 2004 and reads relevantly:
 
 ' SWIS POWER PROCUREMENT 
 STAGE 2 
 
 LAUNCH OF REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP) PHASE 
 
 The respondent] has confirmed that Stage 2 of the Power Procurement Process for 300 MW to 330 MW of baseload generating capacity is to continue to the Request for Proposal Phase.

 
 The Respondents that qualified through the Expressions of Interest Phase have received an RFP Information Memorandum to provide the details of the next steps in the Process.

 
 Essentially this provides for the issue of Requests for Proposal by 27 April 2004 and lodgement of non-binding Proposals by 6 August 2004 for at least 300 MW to 330 MW approximately (sent-out basis at standard conditions) of generating capacity to come into service no later than December 2008.

 
 ... 
 
 [The respondent] will now continue to work with this strong field of Proponents, which includes a good balance between gas-fired and coal-fired proposals, to progress this important public power procurement to obtain additional generating capacity to be in operation by December 2008.
' 
 

28 Secondly, Mr Trumble referred to information in the Bid Information Memorandum --- a document issued by the respondent dated 21 September 2004.
The respondent provided with the Bid Information Memorandum, terms sheets for two agreements which a successful bidder would be required to enter - the 'Available Capacity Agreement' ('ACA') and the 'Tradable Purchase Agreement' ('TPA').
