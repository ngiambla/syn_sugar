 
 1 The further amended notice of motion brought this morning by the Commissioner of Taxation raises a discrete issue of law.
The question may be summarised as whether the purported question of law in par 2(g) of the proposed amended notice of appeal is a question of law for the purposes of s 44 Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth) (' AAT Act ') and O 53 r 3 Federal Court Rules .

 Background 
 
 2 In its substantive application before the Court, the applicant --- the Commissioner of Taxation --- appeals from the decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal given on 17 February 2006 whereby the Tribunal affirmed the imposition of an administrative penalty on the respondent pursuant to s 284 -90 of Sch 1 to the Taxation Administration Act 1953 (' TAA ') but varied the applicant's decision not to remit any part of that penalty, instead ordering that the penalty should be remitted such that it was 25 per cent of the respondent's tax shortfall.
3 In the further amended notice of motion before the Court the applicant moved the Court for orders that the applicant be given leave to amend its notice of appeal in accordance with the draft amended notice of appeal attached to that notice of motion.
4 At the hearing this morning, the respondent took issue with only one aspect of the draft amended notice of appeal --- namely subpara 2(g).
Paragraph 2 sets out the questions of law to be raised on the appeal, and reads as follows: 
 
 'The questions of law raised on the appeal are whether: 
 
 (a) Circumstances relevant to the exercise of the remission discretion confirmed by s 298-20 of Sch 1 to the TAA ("the remission discretion") are not restricted to those relating to the conduct of a taxpayer or at least the taxpayer's circumstances.

 (b) Particularly having regard to the separate provision in the TAA for the payment of general interest charge in respect of a tax shortfall, the fact that a refund of a tax shortfall amount in question was never made to the respondent is an irrelevant consideration in the exercise of the remission discretion.

 (c) The TAA, rather than the applicant, imposes the penalty the subject of the remission decision at the rate of 50 per cent and the applicant thereby becomes entitled to collect such penalty.

 (d) The fact that a refund of the tax shortfall amount in question was never made to the taxpayer meant that no harm was done is an irrelevant consideration in the exercise of the remission discretion.

 (e) Before exercising the remission discretion it is necessary that there be special circumstances.

 (f) Considerations relevant to the exercise of the remission discretion include: 
 
 
 (1) The amount of a tax shortfall.

 (2) A failure on the part of a taxpayer when lodging an amended business activity statement (BAS) with the applicant to consult with a former tax agent or solicitor having knowledge of whether a supply shown on the amended BAS was a taxable supply.

 (3) That the TAA imposed a penalty at the rate of 50 per cent.

 (4) That the whole of the shortfall amount resulted from recklessness as to the operation of a taxation law.

 (5) The existence or otherwise of special circumstances.

 
 
 (g) In the premises the exercise by the Tribunal of the remission discretion miscarried in that the Tribunal acted upon a wrong principle or did not take into account one or more relevant considerations or took into account one or more irrelevant considerations.
