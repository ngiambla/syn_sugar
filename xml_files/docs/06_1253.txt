 
 1 The applicant, Mr Tomkins, is the Chief Pilot and Managing Director of AMT Helicopters Pty Ltd.
The aviation business it carries on includes the provision of helicopter training at all levels.
Prior to 24 March 2006 Mr Tomkins held approvals and ratings from the respondent, the Civil Aviation Safety Authority ('CASA') which enabled him to conduct the business.
AMT held an air operators certificate.
In addition, Mr Tomkins held a delegation from the Director of Aviation Safety dated 25 June 2004 (instrument number CASA334/04) made under the regulations to the Civil Aviation Act 1988 (Cth).
It is not necessary to refer to the document in detail or to the functions delegated under it.
It enabled Mr Tomkins to conduct flight tests at the conclusion of a student's training.
It was expressed to cease having effect at the end of June 2006 2 By letter dated 24 March 2006, signed by Mr Cook, the Manager Operations, General Aviation Operations Groups, CASA notified Mr Tomkins that the approvals and ratings held by him and the certificate held by AMT had been cancelled.
The letter, some 59 pages in length, followed a process whereby Mr Tomkins and AMT were asked to show cause why certain of their authorisations should not be cancelled.
It also contained a reference to the instrument of delegation and recommended that it be revoked.
Mr Tomkins applied to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal to review the cancellation decisions.
Some of the decisions were the subject of an automatic stay pursuant to s 31A of the Civil Aviation Act , to which I shall refer.
Those which were not, or in respect of which it was unclear whether they were subject to the provision, operated, were the subject of an application to the Tribunal for a ' stay ' of the cancellation under s 41 of the Administrative Appeals Act 1975 (Cth).
The Tribunal granted a stay of all but one of the decisions on 31 March 2006 and later ordered a stay with respect to the remaining matter.
The hearing of the application for review is scheduled to be heard by the Tribunal at the end of this year.
3 By letter dated 28 April 2006, the Director of Aviation Safety notified Mr Tomkins that the instrument of delegation was revoked.
It appears this followed upon an initial notice to show cause why the instrument should not be revoked, given on 23 September 2005, and a supplementary show cause notice of 20 December 2005, to which Mr Tomkins' solicitors responded.
4 The Administrative Appeals Tribunal does not have jurisdiction under the terms of the Civil Aviation Act (s 31) to review a decision to revoke a delegation and consequently no application to stay that decision was sought from it.
The delegation came to an end on 30 June 2006, according to its terms.
5 Mr Tomkins applies to this Court for the review of the decision to revoke the delegation on the basis that there had been a failure to take into account three relevant considerations: 
 
 '(a) that the findings of fact upon which the revocation decision was made were the subject of then pending administrative review proceedings brought in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal by the Applicant and AMT; 
 (b) that the operation of the decisions the subject of those review applications were the subject of stay orders made by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal; 
 (c) that the delegation the subject of this proceeding and the licences or authorities the subject of the proceedings in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal formed an integrated whole pursuant to which AMT had hitherto and might reasonably in the future be expected to carry on its business;' 
 
 
 6 It is now conceded that no remitter could be ordered if Mr Tomkins made out his grounds for review, but a declaration is sought in terms of these grounds.
It is put against Mr Tomkins, by CASA, that the declaration has no utility.
At the commencement of the hearing of this application Mr Tomkins applied for an amendment to his application to seek review of a further decision, alleged to have been made by the Director, not to issue a further delegation at least until the outcome of proceedings in the Tribunal.
That application was refused for the reason that the evidence upon which it was based was inadmissible, as relating to settlement negotiations between the parties, and s 131 of the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth) did not apply to it.

 The Statutory Provisions 
 
 7 Section 31 of the Civil Aviation Act provides for review of a reviewable decision by the Tribunal.
A reviewable decision is defined by the section and includes the cancellation of permits, licences and authorisations.
Section 31A was included by the Civil Aviation Amendment Bill 2003, and provides for an automatic stay of certain reviewable decisions.
It applies where CASA is obliged to give a show cause notice to the holder of the civil aviation authorisation in question prior to making the decision (subs (1)).
The stay is of a short duration, in which time the holder must apply to the Tribunal if the stay is to continue in effect for the period mentioned in s 31A(5) (see subs (4)).
Prior to the end of that period the holder may apply to the Tribunal for an order for a stay under s 41(2) of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act (subs (7)).
That subsection provides that the Tribunal may: 
 
 '...make such order or orders staying or otherwise affecting the operation or implementation of the decision to which the relevant proceeding relates or a part of that decision as the Tribunal considers appropriate for the purpose of securing the effectiveness of the hearing and determination of the application for review.
' 
 
 
 8 In submissions for Mr Tomkins reference was made to the provisions of Div 3A of the Civil Aviation Act , which were also the subject of the 2003 amending Act.
They were said to be relevant because they were not employed in the present case.
Section 30DC provides that an aviation authorisation may be suspended where CASA has reason to believe that the holder has engaged in, is engaged in, or is likely to engage in, conduct that constitutes, contributes to, or results, in a serious and imminent risk to air safety.
When CASA does so it is obliged, within the periods specified by s 30DE, to apply to this Court for an order prohibiting the holder of the authorisation from doing anything that is authorised by it.
9 The submissions for Mr Tomkins also relied upon statements in the Explanatory Memorandum with respect to the 2003 Bill concerning the changes to CASA's enforcement regime.
The automatic stay provision was said to be intended to balance ' enhanced fairness with maintaining a high standard of aviation safety' .
This new approach to enforcement would ensure that resources were not wasted on purely technical contraventions that did not significantly affect safety.
The right to seek a merits review from an impartial decision-maker was a primary consideration in the enforcement process, except where there was an immediate serious threat to passengers, it was said.
There was a need for prompt and independent reviews.
It was observed that delays in review might cause financial problems because of the authorisation holder's inability to conduct their business.
The automatic stay provisions would enable their business to continue.
A reduction in the unilateral nature of the exercise of cancellation powers by CASA was thought to be necessary.
10 CASA's functions under s 9(1) of the Civil Aviation Act include the conduct of the safety regulation of civil air operations in Australia.
They include the issuing of certificates, licence and permits.
Section 98(3B) provides that nothing prevents the making of regulations for the delegation of those functions to a person other than a member or officer of CASA.
Regulation 7 of the Civil Aviation Regulations provides that the Director may delegate CASA's powers and functions to a person and that a delegation may be made subject to conditions that are necessary in the interests of the safety of air navigation.
