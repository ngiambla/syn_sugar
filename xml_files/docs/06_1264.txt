 
1 The Australian Competition and Consumer Commissioner ('the ACCC') made application to the Court on 15 March 2005 for various remedies for alleged breaches, by the Respondents, of s 45(2) of the Trade Practices Act 1974 ('the Act').
The remedies sought included declarations, injunctions and the imposition of pecuniary penalties.
The proceeding continued as a defended matter until March this year when an Amended Application, an Amended Statement of Claim and an Amended Defence were provided to the Court.
It was foreshadowed that leave to file these documents would be sought.
The Amended Defence, in substance admitted the allegations made by the ACCC.
In its Amended Application the ACCC considerably narrowed the range of remedies which it was seeking.
At the same time an agreed statement of facts and joint written submissions were filed.
The submissions were made in support of proposed orders to be made by consent to resolve the proceeding.
2 A copy of the agreed statement of facts, which I accept, is attached to these reasons.
3 Section 45(2) of the Act prohibits corporations from making contracts or arrangements if those contracts or arrangements contain, inter alia, provisions restricting the supply of goods to particular persons or classes of person.
The maximum pecuniary penalty for contravention of s 45(2) of the Act is $10 million.
Section 76 of the Act directs the Court to determine a penalty which is appropriate 'having regard to all relevant matters including the nature and extent of the act or omission and of any loss or damage suffered as a result of the act or omission, the circumstances in which the act or omission took place and whether the person has previously been found by the Court in proceedings under [Part VI] to have engaged in any similar conduct.
'
 
4 As the agreed statement of facts discloses the First and Second Respondents were party to an arrangement, entered into on or about 26 March 2002, under which it was agreed that the First and Second Respondents and their related bodies corporate would not sell, market or distribute alluvial garnet to customers in Western Australia and the Northern Territory and that another company which was party to the arrangement, GMA Garnet Pty Ltd, would not sell, market or distribute alluvial garnet to customers in Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania and South Australia.
The purpose of these arrangements was to prevent the supply of alluvial garnet by the First and Second Respondents and their related bodies corporate to customers in Western Australia and the Northern Territory and of preventing the supply of alluvial garnet by GMA Garnet Pty Ltd to customers in Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania and South Australia.
Another company which was party to the arrangement was Garnet International Resources Pty Ltd.
The First and Second Respondents admit that, but for the terms of the arrangements just mentioned, Garnet International Resources Pty Ltd would have been likely to have been a supplier of alluvial garnet in Australia in competition with GMA Garnet Pty Ltd.
The arrangements thus also had the purpose of preventing such competition.
5 The parties have agreed on the form of a declaration and injunctions and the proposed quantum of pecuniary penalties which it is submitted should be imposed on the First and Second Respondents.
It has been agreed that the proceeding be discontinued in respect of all claims made against the Third Respondent.
6 It is proposed that there be a declaration that the First and Second Respondents contravened s 45(2)(a)(i) of the Act by making the arrangement with Garnet International Resources Pty Ltd and GMA Garnet Pty Ltd that contained the exclusionary provisions referred to in [4] above.
7 In my opinion the proposed declaration is appropriate in the circumstances.
It serves the public interest by making it plain that conduct of the kind admitted by the First and Second Respondents contravenes the Act: see ACCC v Midland Brick Company Pty Ltd (2004) 207 ALR 329 at 333; Rural Press Limited v ACCC [2003] HCA 75 ; (2003) 216 CLR 53 at 91.
8 The injunctive relief proposed would restrain the First and Second Respondents from again engaging in the admitted conduct in contravention of s 45 of the Act.
The injunction is expressed to operate for two years.
It would not operate to preclude the making of contracts or arrangements which would not constitute a contravention of s 45 of the Act by reason of the provisions of s 45(6) of the Act.
9 In my opinion it is appropriate that an injunction should be made in the form proposed.
It is clearly expressed so as to make it plain to the First and Second Respondents what conduct on their parts is proscribed: see ACCC v Francis [2004] FCA 487 ; (2004) 142 FCR 1 at 39.
10 It is proposed that each of the First and Second Respondents should pay a pecuniary penalty of $762,500 within 60 days of the day of the Order of the Court.
11 As already noted, the Court is empowered, by s 76 of the Act, to impose pecuniary penalties which it determines to be appropriate in cases such as the present.
In a proceeding in which the parties reach agreement and propose that specific penalties should be imposed, the Court's response is guided by the principles outlined in the joint judgment of Burchett and Kiefel JJ in NW Frozen Foods Pty Ltd v ACCC (1996) 71 FCR 285 at 291.
Their Honours said:
 
 'There is an important public policy involved.
When corporations acknowledge contraventions, very lengthy and complex litigation is frequently avoided, freeing the Courts to deal with other matters, and investigating officers of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to turn to other areas of the economy that await their attention.
At the same time, a negotiated resolution in the instant case may be expected to include measures designed to promote, for the future, vigorous competition in the particular market concerned.
These beneficial consequences would be jeopardised if corporations were to conclude that proper settlements were clouded by unpredictable risk.
A proper figure is one within the permissible range in all the circumstances.
The Court will not depart from an agreed figure merely because it might otherwise have been disposed to select some other figure, or except in a clear case.
