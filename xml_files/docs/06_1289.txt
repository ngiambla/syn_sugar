 BACKGROUND 
 
 1 The applicant, who is a registered pharmacist, wanted to relocate his pharmacy from Cairns in Queensland to Blacktown, New South Wales.
To do this he needed the approval of the Secretary of the Department of Health and Ageing; National Health Act 1953 (Cth) s 90.
The Secretary may only approve an application for relocation if the Australian Community Pharmacy Authority, the respondent in this proceeding, recommends in favour of the relocation.
The Authority recommended that the applicant's application not be approved because the distance between the applicant's proposed premises and the nearest other pharmacy, measured in accordance with the relevant rules determined by the Minister under s 99L , was not sufficient to meet the statutory requirement.
The applicant appealed to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.
2 It is accepted by the parties that, in the present circumstances, the Authority was required to recommend that the application be approved if, in accordance with rule 6(b) of the Minister's rules, the proposed premises at Blacktown were at least: 
 
 
 (i) 1.5 kilometres by straight line measurement from the nearest other premises in respect of which a pharmacist is approved under section 90 of the Act; or 
 (ii) 2 kilometres by the shortest lawful access route measured from mid point at floor level of the public access door opening of the proposed premises nearest to the mid point at floor level of the nearest public access door opening of the nearest other premises in respect of which a pharmacist is approved under section 90 of the Act.

I will refer to the measurements in 6(b)(i) and 6(b)(ii) respectively as the 'straight line measurement' and 'lawful access measurement'.
The Tribunal's findings and conclusion 
 
 3 In applying rule 6 to the proposed premises the Tribunal considered two pharmacies in the Blacktown area, Fegents Pharmacy and Chemworld Chemist.
The Tribunal made the following findings: 1.
The distance between the proposed premises and Fegents Pharmacy was greater than 1.5 kilometres by straight line measurement and less than 2 kilometres by lawful access measurement; 2.
The distance between the proposed premises and Chemworld Chemist was less than 1.5 kilometres by straight line measurement and greater than 2 kilometres by lawful access measurement.
4 The Tribunal concluded that Chemworld Chemist, being less than 1.5km from the proposed premises, is the nearest existing pharmacy to them and that therefore the application must fail.
In reaching this conclusion the Tribunal held that it was only necessary to consider rule 6(b)(i) and that it was unnecessary to consider Fegents Pharmacy.
The Tribunal added, however, that if Fegents Pharmacy were to be considered the application would fail by reason of rule 6(b)(ii).

 THIS APPEAL 
 
 5 The applicant appealed to this Court on the basis that the Tribunal had misinterpreted rule 6(b) and was incorrect in holding that it only needed to consider rule 6(b)(i) in reaching its decision.
The respondent filed a notice of contention also claiming that the Tribunal was in error in failing to apply rule 6(b)(ii) but asserting that, given the Tribunal's factual findings, the error made no difference to the result which, in the circumstances, was correct.
6 I agree with both parties that, as the two limbs of rule 6(b) are separated by the disjunctive, 'or', the applicant only needed to show that the proposed premises satisfied one of the two limbs of rule 6(b).
The Tribunal was in error on this point however as, for reasons given below, I have concluded that the Tribunal's ultimate conclusion was not affected by this error, nothing turns on it.
7 The real issue in the appeal is the meaning of the phrase 'nearest other premises' which occurs in both rule 6(b)(i) and 6 (b)(ii).
In particular, the issue was whether the phrase had the same or different meaning in each subrule.
Despite a cogent argument put by Mr Zipser, counsel for the applicant, I have concluded that the meaning of the phrase is determined by the context of the subrule in which it occurs and for that reason 'nearest other premises' has a different meaning in each subrule.

 The applicant's position 
 
 8 Although I have reached the conclusion stated above, the starting point of my analysis (and the applicant's submissions) is the generally accepted principle that, unless there is a reason to conclude otherwise, such as an indication in the statute itself, 'it is a sound rule of construction to give the same meaning to the same words appearing in different parts of a statute'; Registrar of Titles (WA) v Franzon [1975] HCA 41 ; (1975) 132 CLR 611 at 618 per Mason J.
If that principle were to be applied, the first step in the application of either subrule would be to identify the ' nearest other premises' in respect of which a pharmacist is approved under s 90 of the Act.
On that basis the premises so identified would be the same whether one was applying subrule 6(b)(i) or 6(b)(ii).
9 The Act does not say how one is to determine which other premises is the 'nearest' and therefore, subject to other indications to the contrary, one would give the word its ordinary English meaning.
In the subrules under consideration 'nearest' is used in respect of proximity or distance; it is the superlative form of the adjective, 'near' which, according to the Oxford English Dictionary, means 'to, within or at a short distance' or 'close to a place, thing or person in respect of space or time'.
The 'nearest' other premises are the 'closest' other premises or those which are the shortest distance away.
10 The shortest distance between two places is colloquially referred to as being a 'beeline' or 'as the crow flies', meaning a direct route that has no obstacles and is roughly a straight line measurement.
On this analysis, the nearest other premises to the proposed premises are not necessarily those that are the quickest to reach from the proposed premises.
The statement that 'X pharmacy is the closest' (or nearest), but that it would be 'quicker to get to Y pharmacy' is immediately understandable as making that distinction.
11 Measurement 'as the crow flies' is imprecise although the meaning is clear.
In relation to rule 6, however, additional precision is given by the specific directions in rule 2(b) which states: 
 
 'Where in this Determination a reference is made to a straight line measurement in relation to two premises, that reference is to a straight line measurement from the mid point at floor level of the public access door opening of the first mentioned premises to the same point of the second mentioned premises and where either premises has more than one such opening the reference is to the shortest such straight line measurement which can be made in relation to the two premises.


The applicant's position is that the everyday meaning of 'nearest' as used in both limbs of the rule implies a reference to a straight line measurement.

 12 Applying the above analysis to the facts as found by the Tribunal, the applicant identifies Chemworld Chemist as the nearest other premises to the proposed premises.
Using the straight line measurement, it is less than 1.5 kilometres from the proposed premises but more than 2 kilometres by the shortest lawful access route.
Therefore, according to the applicant's construction of the relevant provision, the proposed premises fails to meet the requirement in rule 6(b)(i) but does satisfy rule 6(b)(ii).
Consequently, the applicant submits, the Tribunal should have found that a positive recommendation to the Secretary was mandated.
13 The applicant's position must be accepted unless there is a good reason to give the phrase 'nearest other premises' a meaning other than its ordinary English meaning.
The respondent finds that good reason in the context of each subrule and in the background and policy of the rules governing the relocation of approved pharmacies.

 Respondent's contextual analysis 
 
 14 The respondent submits that the criterion for determining the 'nearest other premises' is contained within the language of each subrule, in particular in the reference in rule 6(b)(i) to straight line measurement and in 6(b)(ii) to lawful access measurement.
The subrules are expressed as alternatives and each provides a different means of measuring distance.
In the respondent's submission, it is 'inherently unlikely' that Parliament would have intended the distance measurement expressed in one of these subrules to affect the calculation performed under the other subrule.
Accordingly, the respondent submits that the ordinary meaning of the phrase 'nearest other premises' must yield to the context in which it is expressed.
15 Further, the respondent submits that the applicant's interpretation defeats the purpose of having two rules as it would leave rule 6(b)(ii) with nothing to do.
The respondent also submits that the applicant's interpretation involves reading into rule 6(b)(ii) an unarticulated criterion to determine the 'nearest premises'.
According to the respondent the reference to the method of measurement is part of the definition of 'nearest other premises' in each subrule and thus to apply rule 6(b) one finds both the premises that are nearest to the proposed premises by straight line measurement as well as the premises that are nearest by the lawful access measurement.
16 This exercise might identify only one other pharmacy (say premises A) as the 'nearest' by both criteria in which case a positive recommendation can only be made if the distance from A to the proposed premises is at least 1.5 km by straight line measurement or at least 2 km by the lawful access measurement.
In other circumstances, however, finding the nearest other premises could lead to two premises (say A and B) being identified as the 'nearest' under subrules 6(b)(i) and 6(b)(ii) respectively.
In that case a positive recommendation could only be made if the distance from the proposed premises to A was at least 1.5 km by straight line measurement or the distance from the proposed premises to B was at least 2 km by the lawful access measurement.
Counsel for the respondent submitted that rule 6, in providing these alternatives, gave effect to the intention expressed in the Third Community Pharmacy Agreement to simplify the measurement process and thereby provide an alternative for pharmacists who could benefit from the straight line measurement in rule 6(b)(i).
