 
 1 Meriton is a developer of residential and commercial real estate.
Between 2002 and 2004 it constructed the World Tower development.
In March 2002, Mr Rossetto contracted to purchase a strata unit in that development ('the premises').
At that time the World Tower had not been constructed.
The subject matter of these proceedings concerns the circumstances surrounding Mr Rossetto's purchase of the premises.
2 Mr Rossetto claims that prior to entering the contract for purchase of the premises ('the contract') he was misled by representations made to him by representatives of Meriton ('the representations'), allegedly in contravention of s 52 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) ('the Act').
He claims damages that he alleges he has suffered, or is likely to suffer, by reason of that alleged contravention.
The representations are pleaded in the further amended statement of claim and are to the effect that the premises would be the only child care centre in the World Tower.
3 In February 2003, after Mr Rossetto had entered the contract but prior to its completion, Mr Rossetto discovered that Meriton was proposing to advertise another of the strata units for sale as a child care centre.
In June 2003 Mr Rossetto was informed that the other strata unit had been sold to a child care operator.
He complained to Meriton.
In response to those complaints, in October 2003, Meriton offered to permit Mr Rossetto to rescind the contract.
That offer was not accepted.
4 On 8 April 2004, the contract was completed and Mr Rossetto became the registered proprietor of the premises.
Mr Rossetto leased the premises to Bimbee Pty Ltd who granted a sublease to Peppercorn Holdings No 5 Pty Ltd.
In October 2004, Peppercorn commenced to operate a child care centre known as "World Tower Child Care" at the premises.

 THE FURTHER AMENDED STATEMENT OF CLAIM 
 
 5 Meriton seeks, by notice of motion, to strike out Mr Rossetto's further amended statement of claim as disclosing no reasonable cause of action pursuant to O 11 r 16 of the Federal Court Rules ('the Rules') and that the application be dismissed summarily pursuant to O 20 r 2(1)(a).
6 Mr Rossetto was the sole applicant in the original statement of claim, which alleged contraventions of the Act.
In a proposed amended statement of claim, Bimbee was included as an applicant and the pleading amended accordingly but still alleging contraventions of the Act.
By a further amended statement of claim, for which leave to file was granted without opposition, a pleading by Mr Rossetto of breach of collateral contract was added.
