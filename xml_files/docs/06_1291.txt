 
 1 An order was made by the primary judge granting leave to Permanent to join Macquarie and SVB as respondents to proceedings between Permanent as applicant and the respondents ARMA and Mr Teves ( Permanent Custodians Limited v ARMA Pty Limited (No 2) [2006] FCA 847).
Macquarie and SVB seek leave to appeal that decision.
2 The subject matter of the substantive proceedings concerns Permanent's claim that property valuations provided by Mr Teves on behalf of ARMA were made in contravention of ss 52 and 53A of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth).
Permanent sought leave to join Macquarie and SVB (together 'the insurers') pursuant to s 6 of the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1946 (NSW) ('the Act') in relation to two policies of professional indemnity insurance issued to ARMA.
Section 6 allows for a charge to be created on insurance monies payable where the insured is liable to pay damages or compensation (s 6(1)).
However, proceedings against an insurer for a charge shall not be commenced without leave of the Court and leave shall not be granted where the Court is satisfied that the insurer is entitled under the terms of the contract to disclaim liability (s 6(4)).
3 In essence it is submitted that there is no arguable case against the insurers, that they have been incorrectly joined in the proceedings and that the primary judge erred in joining the insurers and finding a reasonable cause of action against them in Permanent (No 2) on 4 July 2006 and Permanent Custodians Limited v ARMA Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 640 (' Permanent (No 1) ') on 29 May 2006.
4 The primary judge accepted that the threshold issue before him was whether the foreshadowed claim against the insurers was reasonably arguable, in the sense that it ' could be seriously put ' ( Permanent (No 1) at [5]).
His Honour also recognised that, as stated by Mason P (with whom Meagher and Handley JJ agreed) in Fishwives Pty Ltd v FAI General Insurance Co Ltd (2002) 12 ANZ Insurance Cases 61-515, the applicable principle is that even though an arguable case against an insurer is established, the Court is ' seized of the discretion to grant leave ' (at [47] citing National Mutual Property Services (Australia) Pty Ltd v Citibank Savings Ltd (1996) 138 ALR 409 at 418).
The insurer is at liberty to argue its right to disclaim liability in the proceedings which follow a grant of leave but ' it does not follow...that a court that is positively satisfied of the insurer's entitlement to disclaim, after issue has been joined on that matter as between the plaintiff and the insurer, must exercise the discretion in favour of the grant of leave ' ( Fishwives at [47]).
5 Two insurance policies were issued by the insurers to ARMA over two consecutive years.
The following constituted, to my mind, the most relevant matters raised, each of which is said to constitute an unarguable defence to Permanent's claim.

 THE FIRST POLICY 
 
 6 The policies were professional indemnity policies for valuers.
The valuation the subject of the proceedings was carried out by Mr Teves on behalf of ARMA.
The insurance period for the first policy was 26 July 2003 to 26 July 2004.
7 The Schedule to the first policy provides eight circumstances in which Macquarie will not cover the insured.
There is no express indication whether the circumstances are conjunctive or disjunctive.
Two of those circumstances are: 
 
 ' We will not cover You for any Claim which : 
 
 ... 
 
 1.7 arises from Valuations undertaken or signed by Brian Smith.

 
 
 
 1.8 arises from Valuations undertaken or signed by any person not named in the SPECIAL CONDITIONS of the Schedule.
' 
 
 
 
 
 8 Mr Teves is not a person named in the special conditions of the Schedule.
The sole named valuer is Terrence Stewart.
Permanent's contention is that it is arguable that the circumstances are cumulative.
Accepting that Mr Teves is not a person named in the special conditions of the Schedule it submits that, at the least because Brian Smith was not the valuer, cover is not precluded.
Permanent accepted that a construction that meant that the conditions for cover were cumulative was superficially unlikely but submitted that it was an arguable construction as there was no actual indication in the first policy whether the conditions were conjunctive or disjunctive.
If conjunctive, clauses 1.7 and 1.8 mean that the limits of cover with respect to the identity of the valuer are such that liability is excluded only where the valuation is undertaken or signed by a valuer not named on the policy and that valuation is undertaken or signed by Mr Smith.
A valuation by an (unnamed) valuer who is not Mr Smith would be covered by the policy.
9 The insurers submit that such a construction is untenable, commercially and as a matter of construction.
10 The primary judge noted Permanent's contention that a conjunctive interpretation was ' sufficiently arguable ' for the purposes of the operation of s 6 of the Act ( Permanent (No 1) at [41]).
When the matter was considered further by His Honour, he referred to the submission that the first policy ' could not conceivably be construed as having a conjunctive operation ' but decided that he should not finally resolve that issue ( Permanent (No 2) at [4]).
11 It is accepted that, if the provisions of clause 1.0 operate disjunctively, there is no insurance cover because Mr Teves was not a person named in the Schedule.
12 In my opinion, there is sufficient doubt as to whether such a conjunctive construction can be said even to be reasonably arguable to warrant reconsideration by a Full Court ( Decor Corporation Pty Ltd v Dart Industries Inc (1991) 33 FCR 397 at 398-9).
13 There was no claim for indemnity made by ARMA during the currency of the first policy.

 THE SECOND POLICY 
 
 14 The primary judge noted that Permanent's case was primarily based on the second policy ( Permanent (No 1) at [20]).
The primary judge seems to have accepted that the applicable insurance cover related to the second policy ( Permanent (No 1) at [39]).
15 Mr Teves was first notified by Permanent of the likelihood of a claim by letters of 23 April 2004 and 13 May 2004 during the currency of the first policy.
The first letter, which would seem to have been sent on Permanent's behalf by Bluestone Mortgages, included a request that Mr Teves ' notify your professional indemnity insurer that circumstances have arisen that may give rise to a claim against you and/or your firm in this matter '.
The insurance period of the second policy was 26 July 2004 to 26 July 2005.
Counsel for the insurers informed the Court that Macquarie was first notified of Permanent's claim on 1 September 2004, during the currency of the second policy.
