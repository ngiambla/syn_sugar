2 CSL carries on business developing, manufacturing, selling and supplying in Australia plasma products, antivenoms and human vaccines.
GSKA markets throughout Australia a range of pharmaceutical products including vaccines.
3 The products at the centre of this dispute are vaccines used for the prevention of infection caused by Human Papillomavirus ("HPV").
More particularly, they are vaccines which are administered to prevent certain types of cancer.

 The background facts 
 
 4 GARDASIL is the world's first cervical cancer vaccine.
It is, at present, the only such vaccine approved in Australia.
It prevents cervical cancer and other HPV related cancers and diseases caused by HPV types 6, 11, 16 and 18.
It was developed following collaboration between CSL and Professor Ian Frazer, who is well-known for his groundbreaking research in this area, and was named Australian of the Year in 2006.
The vaccine has achieved widespread recognition.
5 In 1995, CSL granted an exclusive worldwide licence of its proprietary technology to Merck  Co., Inc. which conducted substantial research leading to the development of GARDASIL.
On 14 December 2005, Merck Sharp  Dohme (Australia) Pty Ltd lodged an application with the Therapeutic Goods Authority ("the TGA") for marketing approval for GARDASIL.
On 16 June 2006, the TGA granted that approval.
The TGA also granted CSL approval to use what is described as the "GARDASIL Product Information Sheet", a document containing technical information regarding the nature and effect of the vaccine.
6 The Product Information Sheet describes GARDASIL as a recombinant, quadrivalent vaccine: 
 
 "The quadrivalent Human Papillomavirus Virus-Like Particle vaccine (HPV VLP vaccine) is a sterile liquid suspension prepared from the highly purified virus-like particles (VLPs) of the recombinant major capsid (L1) protein of HPV Types 6, 11, 16 and 18.
The L1 proteins are produced by separate fermentations in recombinant Saccharomyces cerevisiae CANADE 3C-5 (Strain 1895) and self-assembled into VLPs.
The VLPs for each type are purified and adsorbed on aluminum-containing adjuvant (amorphous aluminum hydroxyphosphate sulfate).
The quadrivalent HPV VLP vaccine is prepared by combining the adsorbed VLPs of each HPV type, the aluminum-containing adjuvant formulation, and a buffer.

 
 GARDASIL is a sterile preparation for intramuscular administration.
Each 0.5-mL dose contains approximately 20 mcg of HPV 6 L1 protein, 40 mcg of HPV 11 L1 protein, 40 mcg of HPV 16 L1 protein, and 20 mcg of HPV 18 L1 protein.

 
 Each 0.5-mL dose of the vaccine contains approximately 225 mcg of aluminum (as amorphous aluminum hydroxyphosphate sulfate adjuvant), 9.56 mg of sodium chloride, 0.78 mg of L-histidine, 50 mcg of polysorbate 80, 35 mcg of sodium borate, and water for injection.
The product does not contain a preservative or antibiotics.
" 
 
 
 7 GARDASIL is "indicated" in females aged 9 to 26 years for the prevention of cervical, vulvar, and vaginal cancer, precancerous or dysplastic lesions, genital warts, and infection caused by HPV types 6, 11, 16 and 18 (which are included in the vaccine).
It is also indicated in males aged 9 to 15 years for the prevention of infection caused by HPV types 6, 11, 16 and 18.
It is administered intramuscularly in three separate doses over a period of some months, and a subsequent booster is required some years later.
8 By an agreement effective on 1 May 2006, Merck  Co., Inc. appointed CSL as its exclusive distributor of GARDASIL in Australia.
CSL launched GARDASIL officially on 28 August 2006.
The launch was accompanied by substantial marketing activity which included advertising in medical journals, mail-outs to healthcare practitioners, media releases and conference presentations.
The evidence is that the market in Australia for a vaccine of this nature is substantial.
9 In or about March 2006, GSKA applied to the TGA for approval to market its vaccine for the prevention of cervical cancer.
However, to date that vaccine, CERVARIX, has not been approved by the TGA for any indication.
It appears that marketing approval is not imminent, but GSKA's application is likely to be reviewed "within the first half of 2007".
10 It is necessary to say something briefly about HPV and cervical cancer.
It is common ground between the parties that HPV is both a common and contagious virus which is usually transmitted by sexual contact and is a cause of, amongst other things, cervical cancer in women.
Approximately 75 per cent of the adult population, male and female, will be infected by HPV at some stage during their lifetime.
In most cases, the human immune system will eliminate the infection.
However, if it persists over time, it has the potential to cause precancerous cervical lesions and ultimately cervical cancer.
11 Cervical cancer is the second most common cancer in women worldwide.
In Australia it accounts for some 230 deaths and 800 new cases per year notwithstanding Papanicolaou (pap) smear screening programs.
12 HPV is also said to be responsible for less common cancers, including up to 50 per cent of cases of vulvar cancer and 60 to 65 per cent of vaginal cancer, as well as approximately 90 per cent of cases of genital warts.
13 There are more than 100 strains of HPV.
Several of those cause cervical cancer or precancerous lesions.
The strains of HPV principally implicated in cervical cancer are HPV types 16 and 18.
These types are responsible for approximately 70 per cent of all cervical cancer in women worldwide.
14 HPV types 31 and 45 are also associated with cervical cancer.
15 HPV types 6 and 11 are responsible for 90 per cent of cases of genital warts.
16 Pharmaceutical products, including vaccines, may not be imported into, manufactured or supplied in Australia unless they have been entered in the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods ("the ARTG").
An application for regulatory approval must include a dossier of chemical, pre-clinical and clinical data relating to the production, safety and efficacy of the product.
This data is reviewed by the TGA and the Australian Drug Evaluation Committee ("the ADEC").
That review determines the proposed "indications" for use.
17 In order to gain marketing approval a product information sheet, which defines the indications for the pharmaceutical product, must also be approved.
Section 21B(3) of the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 (Cth) prohibits a person from representing that therapeutic goods that are not included in the ARTG are so included.
Although CSL at one point alleged that GSKA had contravened this provision, it did not rely upon any such contention in support of its application for interlocutory relief.

 The GSKA Information Sheet 
 
 18 In June and July 2006, GSKA engaged in what it described as a "market research project".
That activity, which was undertaken by a market research organisation known as Australian Fieldwork Solutions, consisted of contacting general practitioners by telephone to ascertain whether they were interested in participating, for a fee, in market research on cervical cancer vaccines, and if so sending by facsimile an information sheet containing comparative information on GARDASIL and CERVARIX ("the GSKA Information Sheet").
Subsequently the general practitioner would again be contacted by telephone, and interviewed.
19 The GSKA Information Sheet was a two page document containing some background information describing the impact and cause of cervical cancer, and particularly its links with HPV.
It emphasised the importance of regular pap smears as early detection tools, and the need for regular screening.
None of this was in any way contentious.
20 However, the GSKA Information Sheet went on to deal, in a comparative way, with GARDASIL and CERVARIX.
It stated that there were two companies developing a vaccine that would offer protection against HPV types 16 and 18 -- the two key cervical cancer causing types.
It said that women would be able to choose which of the two vaccines they preferred.
It observed that it was anticipated that the government would fund a free vaccination program for girls at school while for other women there would be two vaccines available from their general practitioner to be paid for privately, each costing around $400 per course of three injections.
It added that both vaccines were expected to give at least 10 years protection before any boosters were required.
