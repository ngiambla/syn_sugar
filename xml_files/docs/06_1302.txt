 INTRODUCTION 
 
 1 I have before me the further hearing of the trial of the action in relation to a number of specific matters consequent upon the publication of Reasons for Judgment on 30 June 2006 in proceedings commenced by the Employment Advocate for the purposes of the Workplace Relations Act 1996 (Cth) ('the Act') pursuant to which a declaration was sought that each of the four respondents engaged in contraventions of s 298K of the Act in two respects.
First, in August and September 2002, the First, Third and Fourth Respondents terminated the employment of 12 individuals employed at the South Grafton Abattoir for a prohibited reason or reasons that included a prohibited reason.
Secondly, that each of the four respondents between mid September 2002 and December 2002 then refused to employ any one of 11 of those individuals, again for prohibited reasons.
2 Apart from a declaration of a contravention of s 298K of the Act, the Employment Advocate sought an order imposing on each respondent a penalty pursuant to s 298U(a) of the Act, an order pursuant to s 298U(c) of the Act requiring the respondents to pay the 12 individuals compensation for the affect upon each of them of the contravening conduct and an order in reliance upon s 356(b) of the Act that any penalty imposed upon the respondents be paid to the Applicant.
3 Section 298T(2)(d) of Div.
6 of Pt XA of the Act provides that the Employment Advocate may apply to the Federal Court of Australia for orders under s 298U concerning conduct in contravention of Pt XA.
4 On 30 June 2006, I published Reasons for Judgment and adjourned the matter to a date to be fixed to enable the Applicant to formulate short minutes of order reflecting the declarations to be made arising out of the findings contained in the reasons and to hear the parties in relation to further submissions concerning the principles governing the assessment of a compensation component described as general damages in the Applicant's Further Further Amended Statement of Claim, the principles governing whether, and if so, the basis upon which a penalty pursuant to s 298U(a) of the Act ought to be imposed, further submissions concerning the position in relation to Mr Blackadder and submissions concerning the principles guiding the circumstances in which an order might be made under s 356 of the Act that any penalty imposed upon any one or more of the Respondents be paid to the Employment Advocate ( McIlwain v Ramsey Food Packaging Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 828).
5 No final orders have been made in the matter consequent upon the published Reasons for Judgment.
6 On 3 August 2006, the matter was further reviewed and these directions were made ( McIlwain v Ramsey Food Packaging Pty Ltd (No.
3) : [2006] FCA 994): 
 
 
 '(a) the Respondents shall file in the court and serve upon the Applicant any further affidavit material upon which any of them intend to rely in relation to the determination of the question of whether a penalty ought to be imposed upon any of them pursuant to s 298U(a) of the Workplace Relations Act 1996 (Cth) by 4.00pm, Thursday, 17 August 2006; 
 
 (b) the Applicant shall file affidavits in reply (if any) by Thursday, 24 September 2006; and 
 
 (c) the matter will be re-listed for the hearing of further submissions at 10.15am on Monday, 28 August 2006.
' 
 
 
 
 
 7 I had previously made directions that the Applicant and the Respondents file and serve written submissions in relation to the principles guiding the assessment of compensation for the purposes of the Act and the principles informing whether, and if so the basis upon which, a penalty pursuant to s 298U ought to be imposed.
On Friday, 1 September 2006, the further hearing of these matters took place.
8 On 14 August 2006, the Applicant filed a notice of motion returnable 1 September 2006 by which the Applicant sought to further amend the application so as to seek an order pursuant to s 356(b) of the Act that any monetary penalty imposed upon any of the Respondents be paid to the individuals rather than the Applicant.
The Applicant has filed and served written submissions in support of the orders sought.
The Respondents object to the proposed amendment as it has been raised very late in the day.
However, the Respondents are not able to point to any prejudice to the Respondents as any penalty that might be imposed upon any one or more of the Respondents would either be paid to the Consolidated Revenue Fund of the Commonwealth or the Employment Advocate or as might otherwise be ordered consistent with principle.
9 I will give leave to amend the application in terms of the Further Further Further Further Amended Application marked Attachment 'A' to the Notice of Motion filed 14 August 2006 which reflects an amended order 5 sought by the application in these terms: 
 
 
 '5.
An order under s356(b) of the Act that any penalty imposed on the respondents be paid to the persons named in paragraph 1 above.
' 
 
 
 
 The Affidavit of Stuart Bruce Ramsey 
 
 10 On 14 August 2006, the Respondents filed evidence upon which they proposed to rely in relation to the further matters to be addressed.
The evidence consists of an affidavit sworn 10 August 2006 by Mr Stuart Bruce Ramsey, the Managing Director of each of the four respondent companies.
The affidavit is in these terms: 
 
 
 '1.
I am the Managing Director of each Respondent Company.
With the assistance of various staff members I manage the business of the Respondent Companies.
' 
 
 2.
On 3 August 2006, Justice Greenwood dismissed a notice of motion made on behalf of my companies seeking a stay of any further hearing of the proceeding being Federal Court proceedings QUD66 of 2003 and ordered the Respondents' file and serve further affidavit material upon which they intend to rely in relation to the determination of the question of whether a penalty ought to be imposed upon any of my Respondents Companies.

 
 3.
Annexed hereto and marked "SBR-1" are copies of draft accounts for 30 June 2006 for each of the Respondent Companies.
Three of the companies are labour hire companies, with the execution of Ramsey Butchering Services Pty Ltd which ceased to be an employer at South Grafton Abattoir on or about 3 September 2001.
All four (4) Respondent Companies own no assets of any significance and their sole income is a labour hire fee which is expended for the provision of that labour.

 
 4.
The wholesale beef industry is in troubled times.
Markets are hard to service.
Appropriate cattle are not available.
The South Grafton Abattoir as a total enterprise is losing thousands of dollars per week.
It may shut shortly.

 
 5.
I expect more abattoirs to close soon.
Over the last ten (10) years the number of abattoirs has decreased.
There are very few abattoirs now in existence.

 
 6.
At the time of the stock shortage I obtained legal advice from my solicitor, Junior Counsel and Senior Counsel as to the appropriate method of arranging staff stand downs when closing the plant.
Likewise when reopening the plant I again sought advice and acted on that advice.
' 
 
 
 
 
 11 Those six paragraphs represent the totality of the evidence put before the court in relation to these additional matters by the Respondents.
The attachment to the affidavit comprises the financial report (that is financial accounts) to 30 June 2006 for Ramsey Food Packaging Pty Ltd, Ramsey Food Packaging No.
2 Pty Limited, Ramsey Butchering Services Pty Limited and Ramsey Food Services Pty Limited.
12 The Applicant objects to aspects of Mr Ramsey's affidavit.
As to the first three sentences at paragraph 4, the Applicant contends that these sentences are simply expressions of opinion.
In addition, they are said to be 'so vague as to be useless in any consideration of the issues' now before the court.
Even if the subject matter of each sentence is sufficiently specific and is shown to rest upon a foundation of fact giving rise to the conclusions, the matters are said, in any event, to be irrelevant.
Further, the only matters in paragraph 4 that are said to be relevant are the matters going to the circumstances of the South Grafton Abattoir.
13 As to paragraph 5, the Applicant objects to the whole of it although it simply comprises three sentences.
The basis for the objection is said to be that the matters are expressions of opinion as to what might happen in relation to other abattoirs, a statement that the number of abattoirs has decreased and an observation that there are very few abattoirs now in existence.
All of these matters are said to be vague and irrelevant.
14 As to paragraph 6, Mr Ramsey says that he relied upon legal advice from not only his solicitor but also Junior Counsel and Senior Counsel as to the appropriate method of arranging stand downs when closing the plant.
Further, Mr Ramsey says that when reopening the plant, he again sought advice presumably from each of the three previously nominated advisers and acted on that advice.
The Applicant objects to paragraph 6 on the grounds that the statements are hearsay; the deponent has sought to suggest inferentially the advice he was given consistent with things he actually did; and the affidavit fails to disclose the advice itself.
Accordingly, neither the Applicant nor the court, it is said, is in a position to make an informed assessment of the scope of the advice, its materiality to particular conduct by Mr Ramsey on behalf of the Respondents or the extent to which Mr Ramsey relied upon the advice or parts of it.
Mr Ramsey has elected not to waive privilege in relation to the advice, nor attach a copy of any written advice to his affidavit, nor depose to the central and critical matters which provided the foundation for his election to act in any particular way.
15 In response to these matters, counsel for the Respondents says that as to paragraph 4, the assertions made by Mr Ramsey are simply a fact.
The sentences depose to Mr Ramsey's state of mind.
In any event, if the statements represent a matter of opinion, Mr Ramsey is qualified to give that opinion as he is the Managing Director of each respondent company.
Further, paragraphs 4 and 5 are said to be relevant to the financial impact upon the Respondents of a penalty and the matter of public interest.
The public interest is said to be reflected in the community interest in securing enduring employment at the South Grafton Abattoir particularly having regard to the historical circumstances surrounding the industrial arrangements which were put in place to enable the South Grafton Abattoir to recommence under Mr Ramsey's governance after the closure of the abattoir under the administration of R J Gilbertson Pty Ltd.
Accordingly, counsel for the Respondents says that I should have regard to the financial circumstances confronting the Respondents based upon the evidence of the accounts and consider the public interest in future employment.
Counsel also says that the three sentences making up paragraph 5 provide contextual relevance concerning the circumstances in which the South Grafton Abattoir operates.
16 As to paragraph 6, counsel says that the evidence that Mr Ramsey sought advice from his lawyers, obtained advice and acted upon it is relevant to Mr Ramsey's state of mind when considering the question of penalty.
Counsel observes that it is simply a fact that needs to be taken into account in weighing where the balance lies in assessing a possible penalty.
17 I will admit the entirety of the affidavit into evidence.
The evidence is largely unhelpful.
Paragraph 4 comprises four short conclusionary sentences or statements of prevailing circumstances.
There are no foundation facts supporting the statements and no attempt has been made to describe the environment within which the Respondents operate either in a direct sense or contextually so as to provide the court with a matrix of fact concerning the circumstances confronting the operational activity of each company.
Mr Ramsey as Managing Director of each of the four Respondents must be in a position to express an informed assessment of that environment and those circumstances.
18 Similarly, paragraph 5 simply comprises three sentences.
19 As to paragraph 6, I propose to have regard to the fact that Mr Ramsey took legal advice.
However, the brevity with which the matter is expressed does not place me in a position where I can weigh that fact in any meaningful way as I have no sense of the materiality of the advice, the scope of the advice or the extent to which Mr Ramsey relied upon it.
In order to be helpful and properly serve the interests of the Respondents, the deponent would need to disclose the advice so as to give the point Mr Ramsey seeks to make by force of paragraph 6, some real coherence.

 BACKGROUND MATTERS 
 
 20 On 30 June 2006, I published Reasons for Judgment ('the reasons') in relation to the matters dealt with in the reasons.
I do not propose to repeat the detail of those reasons in the course of these considerations although it will be necessary to identify some aspects of the findings and the contextual events in these reasons arising out of the further hearing.
These reasons are to be read in conjunction with the earlier reasons of 30 June 2006.
21 The material matters are these.
22 In August and September 2002 the First, Third and Fourth Respondents were the employers of the 12 individuals (among others) identified at [2] and [114] of the reasons.
Those paragraphs identify the particular bilateral employment relationship between each individual and the relevant Respondent employer.
The individuals are Brooks, Campbell, Susan Young, Swain, Blackadder, Delaforce, Forrest, Hambly, Michael McKenzie, Paul McKenzie, Moss and John Young.
23 Each individual was employed in a particular capacity undertaking work at the South Grafton Abattoir.
The position each individual held is identified at [114] of the reasons.
The history of the working engagement of each individual at the South Grafton Abattoir is described at [115].
The South Grafton Abattoir had for many years been owned and operated by R J Gilbertson Pty Ltd ('Gilbertson').
The abattoir had closed in December 1997 with Gilbertson asserting failing profitability and substantial accumulated losses.
In approximately April 1998, the abattoir reopened under the new ownership and operational governance of Mr Stuart Ramsey acting on behalf of entities including the First Respondent, the Third Respondent and the Fourth Respondent.
24 The immediate events of termination involve these matters.
On Monday, 19 August 2002, the Australian Industrial Relations Commission ('AIRC') made an order which had the effect of terminating a range of Australian Workplace Agreements ('AWAs') with effect from 23 September 2002 including AWAs signed by Blackadder, Brooks, Campbell, Delaforce, Forrest, Hambly, Michael McKenzie, Paul McKenzie, Moss, John Young and Susan Young.
25 On Wednesday, 21 August 2002, management of the South Grafton Abattoir placed a notice on the abattoir noticeboard to all employees advising that the plant continued to operate under a stock shortage for the purposes of the AWAs until advised otherwise.
On 29 August 2002, a further notice was placed on the noticeboard referring to the notice of 21 August 2002 and notifying employees that there would not be sufficient stock to kill on Monday, 2 September 2002 and that certain consequences would flow from that event.
The notice said that the Australasian Meat Industry Employees' Union ('AMIEU') had been advised of the position.
Also on 29 August 2002, employees were handed a stock shortage notice.
26 On 10 September 2002, the individuals received a letter of termination from abattoir management and a further letter of clarification of the position on 13 September 2002.
The events are described in detail at paragraphs [180] to [187] of the reasons.
27 The act of termination or dismissal had a certain pre-history.
28 Although Stuart Ramsey had conducted discussions with Ms Kathleen Evans, the secretary of the Newcastle and northern branch of the AMIEU, as described at [102] and [103] of the reasons, no agreement had been reached to establish an enterprise agreement.
Rather, the First, Third and Fourth Respondents entered into AWAs with their employees at the various functional levels of operation of the abattoir.
Those functional activities are described at [106] to [111].
29 The Employment Advocate referred each of the AWAs to the AIRC for an approval hearing.
The AIRC concluded that because the 'tally system' (see [107] of the reasons) adopted by the AWAs was more disadvantageous to employees than the relevant award with a follow through effect upon benefits, the AWAs failed to satisfy the 'no disadvantage test'.
However, having regard to other factors, the AIRC concluded that it was not contrary to the public interest to approve the AWAs coupled with particular undertakings [117] --- [120].
30 Each AWA had a nominal term of three years, from, by and large, the end of April 1998 although each AWA would remain in place after the date of nominal expiry until such time as the AWA was replaced or terminated.
31 On 15 February 2001, Stuart Ramsey convened and addressed a meeting of employees at the abattoir.
At that time, many of the employees believed that a new agreement would be in place during April 2001 but no new agreement was to be proposed until October 2001.
The delay was attributed to conduct on the part of Mr Davis and the AMIEU [123] - [131].
32 On 3 October 2001, Stuart Ramsey proposed a certified agreement with a vote to be taken on 18 October 2001.
The methodology was to take the prevailing AWAs and adopt certain variations to those instruments as the terms and conditions of the agreement.
At a meeting on 3 October 2001 of abattoir workers chaired by Paul McKenzie, a decision was taken to establish a consultative committee to negotiate aspects of the proposal with Mr Ramsey.
The members of the committee included Delaforce, Moss and Paul McKenzie.
33 Delaforce was expressing dissatisfaction on a number of grounds with working conditions [136] --- [144].
34 On 5 October 2001, Mr Davis on behalf of the AMIEU wrote to Mr Ramsey advising that he proposed to meet with employees and discuss aspects of the proposal [145] --- [149].
35 On 16 or 17 October 2001, a second proposal for an enterprise agreement was distributed by the abattoir.
A critique of that proposal was prepared by the AMIEU.
The proposal was to be voted upon by employees on 5 November 2001.
36 On 8 November 2001, a third proposal was put forward by the employer entities reflecting a further change.
The vote occurred on 26 November 2001.
37 On 18 January 2002, the AIRC conducted a hearing of an application by the First, Second and Third Respondents and Paul Allen Contracting Services Pty Ltd for certification of an enterprise agreement.
The AMIEU sought leave to intervene and oppose the application on a number of grounds.
On 8 February 2002, Commissioner Bacon published his decision arising out of the application and referred the matter to the Full Bench.
Commissioner Bacon also gave reasons for the intervention ruling in favour of the AMIEU confirming the continuing standing of the AMIEU to represent employee members of the Union in connection with the proposed enterprise agreement [157] --- [162].
38 On 15 February 2002, Stuart Ramsey met with representatives of the employees.
Some committee members said that they considered that they should go back to the award conditions.
Some heated exchanges occurred concerning the impact or effect of award conditions upon the abattoir's operation [164] --- [165].
Further discussions took place concerning the question of whether the AMIEU would support certification of the agreement.
A memorandum of understanding was proposed.
No agreement was reached and the application for certification was withdrawn.
39 In April 2002, a second consultative committee was established.
The members included Michael McKenzie, Brooks, Campbell and John Young.
40 On 11 April 2002, Alick Delaforce received notice from Stuart Ramsey concerning the introduction of a new bonus system and the terms upon which a bonus might be paid [171].
Alick Delaforce expressed dissatisfaction with the operation of the bonus system as did others [172] --- [174].
41 During May, June and July 2002, meetings took place between employees at the abattoir and the AMIEU.
On 14 May 2002, Alick Delaforce and Paul McKenzie collected complaint forms from production employees which were lodged with the office of the Employment Advocate.
Alick Delaforce requested assistance from the AMIEU in making an application to the AIRC for termination of the AWAs.
The applications were lodged on 30 July 2002.
An order was made on 19 August 2002 which had the effect of terminating many of the AWAs effective from 23 September 2002.
42 On 19 July 2002, Alick Delaforce participated in a meeting of employees to discuss conditions and establish a third consultative committee.
On 22 August 2002, a resolution was passed electing a third consultative committee and on 23 August 2002 notice was given to management by letter.
The members of the third consultative committee included John Young, Trevor Moss, Paul McKenzie, Gregory Forrest, Terrence Brooks, Alick Delaforce and Susan Young.
43 The articulated basis for the dismissal of the employees including the 12 identified individuals the subject of the proceedings was a stock shortage.
44 On 16 September 2002, in light of the events and the termination letters of 10 September 2002 and 13 September 2002 [26] of these reasons, Alick Delaforce, Trevor Moss and Justin Davis sought a meeting with Stuart Ramsey to discuss re-engagement of Union members of the workforce.
Justin Davis told management that all employees were prepared to work and would work if given work.
Management said that the abattoir was offering work that day to only those individuals contacted by the abattoir [188].
On 17 September 2002, Justin Davis conducted (with Mr Brown) a meeting of workers outside the abattoir.
As employees approached the security guards, the names of particular employees seemed to be checked off against a list.
Some employees were able to enter, others not.
Alick Delaforce asked the gate security guard whether his name was on a list of workers allowed to work that day and was told his name was not on the list.
Later that day he was told in a telephone call from management that there would be work for him at the abattoir for the following day, 18 September 2002.
45 On the evening of Tuesday, 17 September 2002, Alick Delaforce and Trevor Moss conceived a compromise proposal to resolve the re-employment of all employees.
A written proposal was given to management [190].
Stuart Ramsey refused to consider the compromise proposal until all workers rostered for that day, 17 September 2002, returned to work.
46 At [195] --- [202] of the reasons, conclusions are reached arising out of findings in relation to the events.
At [203] of the reasons, these observations are made: 
 
 
 '203.
... Mr Ramsey knew or must be taken to have known that P F McKenzie, Brooks, Campbell, Forrest, M R McKenzie, J K Young and S J Young were members of the Union.
Mr Ramsey also knew of the articulated dissatisfaction with conditions identified by Delaforce and Moss and the critique of conditions of employment prepared by the Union and the dissatisfaction expressed with conditions by members of the consultative committees.
The first committee included Union members P F McKenzie, Moss and Delaforce; the second, M R McKenzie, Brooks, Campbell and J K Young; and the third, J K Young, S J Young, Moss, Forrest, Brooks, Delaforce and P F McKenzie.
Having regard to the chronology of these events and the proximity of the timing between the successful applications for termination of the AWAs and the subsequent publication of the dismissal notices, an inference is open that dissatisfaction with working conditions in the context of the agitation by the AMIEU for better industrial conditions of employment was a reason for the dismissal of Delaforce, P F McKenzie, Moss, Brooks, Campbell, Forrest, M R McKenzie, J K Young and S J Young.
The evidence of Mr Forrest at [306] shows that after the dismissals and upon re-engagement of employees (approximately 80 to 90 employees), Mr Ramsey expressed his view of the new environment in this way: 'This is how the place will be run now, no RDOs, one sick day and you will be gone, you will be paid the Federal award until such time as a new agreement is worked out.
There will be no tally system and you will be paid in accordance with the weight per kilo of the box'.
The issue of 'tally' calculations and its relationship with the weight of the beast was an issue for the employers from the outset of operations under Mr Ramsey.
Further, having regard to the role of the AMIEU and the hostility on the part of Mr Ramsey towards the AMIEU, an inference is open that a workplace free of those Union members who had become closely associated with the Union position, acted as delegates, distributed material at the workplace and participated in consultative committees urging a different view of conditions of employment was a reason for dismissal of those individuals who were members of the Union.
Mr Ramsey's notion that the abattoir would have to close and 'the company could not continue' if the AWAs were brought to an end and the award prevailed [164] or that the abattoir 'would not be viable' under such conditions [165] seems not to be so because within days of the abattoir issuing the termination notices of 10 and 13 September 2002 closing the abattoir, the abattoir was operating again by at least 17 September 2002 and, by 20 September 2002, at least 80 to 90 employees were re-engaged.
An inference is open that closure of the abattoir was effected to displace the workforce, re-hire and leave aside at least the current claimants on the ground that these individuals were expressing dissatisfaction with conditions of employment and did so as members of the Union in circumstances where the Union was seeking better industrial conditions.
...' 
 
 
 
 
 47 The circumstances in relation to Stephen Blackadder, Colin Hambly and Paul Swain have a different history.
The relevant events are set out at [204] --- [268].
At [267], the following finding is made: 
 
 
 '267.
The evidence provides a basis for inferring that as to Blackadder, Hambly and Swain, the termination of employment was carried out for a reason including that these men had become entitled to the benefit of an industrial order of the AIRC and to that end, had participated in a proceeding under an industrial law and had given evidence in a proceeding under an industrial law as contemplated by s 298L(1)(h)(j) and (k).

 48 At [269] --- [288], the evidence of John Graham Broadway in relation to the contended stock shortage is addressed.
The evidence in relation to the role of seasonal factors and the contended stock shortage are further addressed at [289] --- [304].
49 In the period immediately after the dismissal of the 12 individuals, 11 of them took steps to seek employment during the re-engagement period.
Those steps are set out at [306] and they are these:
 '306.
