 Factual Background 
 
 3 The primary facts as to the background circumstances giving rise to this application are not in contention.
On 11 August 1933 the first defendant, Linden  Conway Limited ('LND'), was registered pursuant to the laws of Queensland.
On 15 July 1968 the second defendant, Mr Allan Rowe, became a director of LND.
In the same year he became the Chief Executive Officer of LND.
On 10 July 2003 the second plaintiff, Leopard Asset Management Pty Ltd ('LAM'), was incorporated pursuant to the Act.
Mr Michael de Tocqueville is the sole director and shareholder of LAM.
In the period from June 2005 to October 2005 LAM acquired parcels of shares in, and became a member of, LND.
4 The LND directors' report showed that, as at 12 August 2005, Mr Rowe was the major shareholder in LND and held interests in, amongst others, the following voting shares in LND: 180,009 (i.e.
85.36 per cent) of the 210,872 fully-paid ordinary shares in LND, and 2,230 (i.e.
73.38 per cent) of the 3,043 fully-paid 9 per cent fixed cumulative preference shares in LND.
5 On 18 November 2005 the first plaintiff, De Tocqueville Private Equity Pty Ltd ('DPE'), was incorporated pursuant to the Act.
Mr de Tocqueville is a director and shareholder of DPE.
On 3 March 2006, DPE acquired all of LAM's shares in, and became a member of, LND.
On 20 March 2006 DPE wrote to Mr Rowe and LND and expressed concerns about the management of LND.
DPE sought responses to each of those concerns.
On 8 May 2006, LND wrote to its shareholders and reported, amongst other things, that LND had received a letter dated 28 April 2006 from Australian Stock Exchange Limited ('ASX'), requiring it to comply with listing rules 12.3 and 12.4 .
ASX wrote: 
 
 Thank you for your letter dated 25 November 2005.

 
 As you are aware, Australian Stock Exchange Limited ("ASX") has been corresponding with the Company since 8 March 2005 in relation to the requirements of listing rules 12.3 and 12.4 , and has previously highlighted that ASX may impose a suspension of trading on an entity's securities where compliance with these rules is at issue.

 
 During this time, ASX has endeavoured to provide the Company with a reasonable period of time within which to take steps necessary to demonstrate compliance with these rules --- in other words, to undertake the investment of sufficient of its cash, to ensure that rule 12.3 no longer applied to it, and to enable the Company to take steps to increase the number of holders of its main class of securities with marketable parcels to approximately 250 to 300 holders, to meet ASX's requirements under rule 12.4.
To date, the Company has stated that it is not in a position to take action necessary to comply with the requirements of these rules.

 
 ASX has considered this matter further and has made the following determination.

 
 
 
 1.
The Company will be afforded a period of six months from the date of this letter to demonstrate to ASX that it complies with listing rule 12.3.
If the Company has not demonstrated compliance with the rule to ASX's satisfaction by 31 October 2006, ASX will suspend the Company's securities from official quotation prior to the commencement of trading on 1 November 2006.

 
 2.
The Company will be afforded a period of 12 months from the date of this letter to demonstrate compliance with listing rule 12.4 , to ASX's satisfaction.
If the Company is unable to demonstrate a level of spread acceptable to ASX by 30 April 2007, ASX will suspend the Company's securities from official quotation on 1 May 2007.

 
 
 
 
 6 The relevant listing rules, 12.3 and 12.4, referred to in the letter from ASX, provide as follows: 
 
 Proportion of assets in cash 
 
 
 
 12.3 If half or more of an entity's total assets is cash or in a form readily convertible to cash, ASX may suspend quotation of the entity's securities until it invests those assets or uses them for the entity's business.
The entity must give holders of ordinary securities in writing details of the investment or use.
This rule does not apply to the following.
