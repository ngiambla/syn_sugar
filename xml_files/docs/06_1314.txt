 THE APPELLANT'S CLAIM 
 
 5 The appellant's refugee claims in front of the Tribunal are set out by way of background: 
 
 I have been living in Colombo since my birth.
I was also educated in Colombo.
I was in Kurunegala from 1982 --- 1985 with my parents, who were actively involved in politics.
That due to a family problem we moved to Colombo.

 
 I was working in an agency called "Amman Travels Pty Ltd after completing the equivalent of year 12, I was employed with the company with two other Tamil boys from Jaffna.
My boss would mostly send Tamil people overseas who would use our travel company and they would often pay more.
We only had a small amount of Sinhalese and Muslims who would go overseas.

 
 In October 2001, we faced a big problem with a boy who was going overseas through our travel agency and we came to know him.
He had some weapons and other documents which were the property of the LTTE, when he was apprehended at Katunayake airport.
He was arrested for being a Tamil tiger and was taken into custody.
He told the security forces that he was travelling through Amman Travel and that two of the employees of Amman Travel had helped him.

 
 That on the same day, police and the CID came to our office and searched the offices.
Whilst searching the office, I was in my office talking to a customer.
They asked me to open a cupboard and when I opened it, inside they found a bag.
They asked me who owned the bag.
I told them I had no knowledge.
They then opened the bag and inside the bag they found weapons, batteries, wires and some documents.
I stressed to them that the bag did not belong to me.
However, the police and CID did not believe me and suspected me of being a Tamil Tiger.
I was then arrested and taken into custody, where I was interrogated.
I was taken to various places.

 
 The police then discovered that my mother was in custody, regarding some youngsters from Jaffna who had boarded with her at home.
This reaffirmed their view that I was a Tamil Tiger and I was kept in custody for nearly ten months.
I was only released, after a payment of money was made to the police.

 
 That people who had paid money to our agency came to know that my boss was out of the country.
They came with police and took me into custody where I was physically abused.
That in the meantime, I encountered problems because of the change in government.
The PA government people had given some air tickets which belonged to the forces, which had been sold by our travel agency for a discount price to the public.
The police and CID came to the office regarding this and I was taken into custody.
There was a recent incident which happened at Urogodawatha in a mosque close to my home town.
The police suspected me and took me into custody, where I was interrogated and tortured.
I was released.

 
 That because of this incident, I lost my studies and faced many problems, which resulted in me going into hiding and living in different places.
That because of the fear I was in, my father made arrangements for me to leave the country.
My father gave my passport and money to an agent.
The agent was told about my situation and the agent told me he would do everything.

 
 A week after the agent had told my father than he will take me at night, so I went to the airport with him.
The agent then gave me a passport and told me that I must travel on that passport.
We then came to Singapore and then to Melbourne airport.
I asked for my passport, but the agent did not give me the passport.
The agent then came outside the airport and gave me a photocopy of the passport and took the original passport with him.
The agent left and I have never seen him since.

 
 I arrived in Australia in February 2003.

 
 THE TRIBUNAL'S DECISION AND REASONS 
 
 6 The Tribunal considered the oral evidence given by the appellant at a hearing on 22 November 2005 and gave comprehensive reasons in which it set out each of the appellant's claims.
In its findings, the Tribunal stated that it did not accept the appellant's claims and found him to be entirely lacking in credibility.
The Tribunal found his claims to be inconsistent with the independent evidence, internally inconsistent at the hearing and so far fetched as to be fanciful.
