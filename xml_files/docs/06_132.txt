 
1 The Court heard Ms Mackay's application under s 178 of the Workplace Relations Act 1996 (Cth) at the same time as the application in Bell v Minister for Health [2006] FCA 134.
These reasons for judgment are to be read together with the reasons for judgment in Bell , delivered this day.
2 Ms Mackay also claimed that her employer breached cl 26 of the Health and Disability Services --- Support Workers - Western Australian Government - Award 2001 in respect of her.
Those days only changed when management altered her work location in mid 2002 and again in May 2004.
All employees in those locations who were not relieving knew when they were to work.


4 Clause 26.7 of the award must be read sensibly.
It requires the display of a roster for full time employees which sets out their start and finishing times and their rostered days off.
If a person is told, whilst employed at a particular location that her or his start and finishing times and rostered days off are fixed there is no need for a formal written roster.
The requirement to display rosters which contain the abvovementioned information is only operative when employees work in accordance with a roster which does not contain fixed working hours.
Any other construction of cl 26.7 of the award would be unworkable impose an unnecessary administrative burden on an employer.
5 For the above reasons and the reasons set out in Bell as to the proper construction of cl 26 of the award, the application is dismissed.
I certify that the preceding five (5) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Marshall.
