 
 1 There are before the Court four matters in which criminal proceedings are brought against the defendant.
Each proceeding was commenced by information and summons.
Each information and summons was dated 20 April 2006: see O 49 r 1 of the Federal Court Rules .
2 Proceeding VID 385 of 2006 alleges an offence against s 75AZS(1) of the Trade Practices Act 1974 ("the Act ").
3 Proceeding VID 386 of 2006 alleges an offence against s 75AZC(1)(a) of the Act .
4 Proceeding VID 387 of 2006 alleges an offence against s 75AZC(1)(k) of the Act .
5 Proceeding VID 388 of 2006 alleges an offence against s 75AZS(1) of the Act .
6 It appears that, at some time after 18 July 2006, when one of the then directors of the defendant swore the affidavit referred to below at [9] on behalf of the company the defendant has gone into liquidation.
Oral evidence was given to the Court by an officer of the prosecutor, Dianna Kinski, by which I was satisfied that service on the informations and summonses had been effected at the registered office of the defendant prior to it going into liquidation.
The defendant was notified of the hearing: its solicitors had signed a consent order on 11 August 2006 fixing the date for hearing as 3 October 2006.
7 When the matter was called on for hearing on 3 October 2006 there was no appearance for the defendant.
I directed that pleas of not guilty be entered in respect of each of the charges and the hearing proceeded.
