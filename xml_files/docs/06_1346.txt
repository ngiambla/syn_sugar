 
 1 Extradition proceedings have been commenced by the first respondent ('the Minister') against the applicant who is known as Daniel Snedden and also as 'Captain Dragan'.
For convenience, the applicant shall be referred to as 'Dragan'.
2 Dragan, a citizen of both Australia and Serbia is in custody at the Parklea Correctional Centre pending a hearing in the Local Court before the fourth respondent.
Such hearing is to commence on 6 December 2006 pursuant to s 19 of the Extradition Act 1998 (Cth) ('the Act') and will determine whether Dragan should be surrendered to the Republic of Croatia.
3 Dragan has instituted proceedings in this Court seeking an order in the nature of habeas corpus against the Minister, the second respondent and the fourth respondent and an order that the Minister, the third and fourth respondent be restrained from taking any step which facilitates Dragan's surrender to the Republic of Croatia.
4 The Minister now moves the Court for an order pursuant to Order 35 Rule 1 of the Federal Court Rules that the hearing of Dragan's claims in this Court be adjourned until the magistrate has determined Dragan's eligibility for surrender.
That motion is the subject of this decision.


 FACTS 
 
 5 On 12 December 2005 a criminal investigation concerning Dragan took place in the County Court of Sibenik in the Republic of Croatia.
Thereafter Warrant KIO-86/05 ('the warrant') was issued in Croatia for his temporary arrest in respect of alleged offences committed by Dragan against the Basic Criminal Code of the Republic of Croatia ('the Code').
The warrant refers to one count of alleged war crimes against the civil population under Article 120 of the Code and to two counts of alleged war crimes against prisoners of war under Article 122.
6 On 19 January 2006 Dragan was taken into custody in Sydney pursuant to a provisional arrest warrant issued under s 12(1) of the Act.
This section authorises a magistrate to arrest a person if the magistrate is satisfied, on the basis of affidavit evidence, ' that the person is an extraditable person in relation to the extradition country ' (see s 12(1)(b)).
7 The Act prescribes the procedure to be followed when an ' extradition request ' is made by an ' extradition country ' in respect of an ' extradition offence' .
'Extradition offence' is defined in s 5 of the Act, and includes, inter alia, an offence against the law of the country for which the maximum penalty is death or imprisonment for a period of not less than 12 months.
' Extradition request' is defined as 'a request in writing by an extradition country for the surrender of a person to the country ', and ' extradition country ' is identified as any country that is declared by the regulations to be an extradition country.
8 Section 16(1) enables the Attorney General to issue a notice to a magistrate once an extradition request is made , informing a magistrate that a request has been made for extradition.
Section 16(2) provides: 
 
 '(2) The Attorney-General shall not give the notice: 
 
 
 
 (a) unless the Attorney-General is of the opinion: 
 
 
 
 
 
 (i) that the person is an extraditable person in relation to the extradition country; and 
 
 (ii) that, if the conduct of the person constituting the extradition offence , or any of the extradition offences, for which surrender of the person is sought, or equivalent conduct, had taken place in Australia at the time at which the extradition request was received, the conduct or the equivalent conduct would have constituted an extradition offence in relation to Australia; or 
 
 
 
 
 
 (b) if the Attorney-General is of the opinion that there is an extradition objection in relation to the extradition offence, or all of the extradition offences, for which surrender of the person is sought.
' 
 


Once such notice has been issued, the magistrate is to conduct a hearing under s 19 of the Act, unless the person to whom it is given consents to surrender (see s 18).

 9 Pursuant to s 55 of the Act, regulations may be made to give effect to provisions of the Act.
The Extradition (Croatia) Regulations 2004 ('the Regulations') were made pursuant to the Act and provide inter alia that the Republic of Croatia is an extradition country for the purposes of the Act.
10 On 18 March 2006 following receipt of an extradition request from Croatia, the Minister issued a notice pursuant to s 16(1) of the Act ('the s 16(1) notice').
