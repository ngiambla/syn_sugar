 
 1 In this matter I am satisfied from the evidence that the defendant, Joseph Sleiman, is presently unable to act as either liquidator or administrator of the companies respectively listed in the initiating process as his registration has been cancelled pursuant to s 1292(2) of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) (the Act) (s 448B ; s 532(1) of the Act).
Whilst he has filed an appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal he has not sought any stay of the cancellation.
By saying that I do not mean to indicate that I would expect that there would be any such application.
However, the status quo being what it is, there is little alternative but to ensure that the administration and liquidation of these various companies goes ahead in an orderly fashion not interrupted any more than is necessary by what has occurred.
2 The appropriate consents having been lodged and the appropriate proof in relation to each company having been tendered, I am satisfied that the orders should be made pursuant to s 449B and s 503 of the Act respectively.
I make orders in accordance with the short minutes of orders which I have initialled and placed with the papers.




 I certify that the preceding two (2) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Gyles.
