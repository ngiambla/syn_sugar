 
 1 Snowy Mountains Organic Dairy Products Pty Ltd began proceedings in this Court against Wholefoods Pty Ltd and Stephen Whitsed.
Mr Whitsed was a former director of the Dairy.
The principal of Wholefoods, Scott Kinnear, on 23 November 2004 wrote a letter to Consumer Affairs Victoria asking it to investigate the truthfulness of the labelling of organic milk and cream produced under the Dairy's brand.
He based this, in part, upon what he said were records of telephone conversations he had had with Mr Whitsed who had raised concerns about the source of the Dairy's 'organic milk' which was currently on the market.
2 The Dairy had ceased an association with Mr Whitsed who had supplied certified organic milk prior to this conversation.
Apparently the Dairy had also ceased its arrangements with the National Association of Sustainable Agriculture of Australia (NASAA) which was a certifier of organic products.
3 Wholefoods seeks to have these proceedings transferred to the Supreme Court of Victoria pursuant to s 5(4) of the Jurisdiction of Courts (Cross Vesting) Act 1987 (Cth).
Alternatively, it has sought to have the proceedings remitted to the Federal Magistrates Court in its Victoria District Registry pursuant to O 82.5 of the Federal Court Rules and s 48 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth).
As another alternative, Wholefoods has sought an order under s 48 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) that the proceedings be conducted in the Victorian Registry of the Court.

 DEFAMATION PROCEEDINGS IN SUPREME COURT OF VICTORIA 
 
 4 Prior to the Dairy bringing the proceedings in this Court, it had sued in the Supreme Court of Victoria for two separate allegedly defamatory publications.
The first was in respect of the broadcast of a story on the 'Country Hour' programme by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation on 1 August 2005.
The Dairy joined the two reporters and Mr Kinnear, who gave an interview on the broadcast.
The interview referred to Mr Kinnear as a director of another company, Biological Farmers Australia.
He expressed concern during the interview that the Dairy was selling organic dairy products which he said were uncertified organic products and that his organization represented certified organic products across Australia.
Apparently, one of the issues in the Supreme Court proceedings is that produce which is to be exported from Australia must be certified, as organic, by a recognized certification organization whereas produce sold domestically does not.
Thus, it is possible, as I understand the allegations thus far, for genuinely organic produce to be sold domestically without ever having been certified as such.
On the other hand, it is possible that produce can be claimed to be organic when produced and sold for domestic consumption, but there is no requirement for certification that it is in fact so.
The subject matter of the interview that was broadcast canvassed this question.
5 The second group of defendants in the Supreme Court proceedings were the Herald  Weekly Times Pty Ltd and one of its journalists who published an article in the Weekly Times of about 24 August 2005 under a headline 'Dairy fears over organics'.
That article did not name Mr Kinnear or Wholefoods, but did refer to the fact that an investigation by Consumer Affairs Victoria had been conducted into the Dairy.
It noted that despite the company's title, its suppliers did not have to be certified as that organic producers.
A number of persons was reported to have made comments to the effect that consumers could be misled because of the failure to have a regulatory regime in place for domestic sales of organic produce.
6 On 12 April 2006, Bongiorno J dismissed complaints by the various defendants in the Supreme Court proceedings that they had all been inappropriately joined in the one proceedings notwithstanding that there were two separate and quite distinct publications in respect of which there were distinct issues ( Snowy Mountains Organic Dairy Products Pty Ltd v Australian Broadcasting Corporation [2006] VSC 138).
He held that any defendant could apply again at or before the trial for appropriate relief to separate the issues as to the two publications.
Bongiorno J said that he was satisfied that taking all the relevant circumstances into account it was convenient not only to the parties, but from the Court's own perspective, to permit the matter to proceed in its present form.
He concluded that at that stage of the preparation of the matter there was no undue risk of unfairness to any party by permitting the issues arising from two publications to remain joined and that it could lead to considerable savings of time and cost of doing so.
7 After Bongiorno J gave judgment, the defendants in the Supreme Court filed defences, each of which raised pleas of justification, although the issues that were to be justified were distinct as I shall explain.
