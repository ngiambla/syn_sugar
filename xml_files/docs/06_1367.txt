 
 1 On 28 September 2006 I made orders confirming two schemes of amalgamation pursuant to s 194 of the Life Insurance Act 1995 (Cth) ('the Act').
The first is the amalgamation of the life insurance business of MLC Lifetime Company Limited ('Lifetime') with part of the life insurance business of MLC Limited ('MLC') ('the Lifetime Scheme').
The second is the amalgamation of the life insurance business of National Australia Financial Management Limited ('National') with part of the life insurance business of MLC ('the National Scheme').
These are the reasons for making those orders.
2 Confirmation of the schemes is required by s 190(1)(b) of the Act.
That section provides that '[n] o part of the life insurance business of a life company may be...amalgamated with the business of another life company...except under a scheme confirmed by the Court '.
The applicants are ' life companies ' within the meaning of the Act.
They applied to the Court for confirmation of the schemes pursuant to s 193(1) of the Act.
3 National Australia Bank Limited ('NAB') is the ultimate parent company of the applicants.
