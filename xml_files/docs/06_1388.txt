 
 1 This is a representative proceeding under Pt IVA of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) ('the Federal Court Act').
The applicants allege that the respondents contravened s 45 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) ('the Trade Practices Act '), and claim declarations pursuant to s 163A of that Act (and/or s 21 of the Federal Court Act), damages pursuant to s 82 of that Act, injunctions pursuant to s 80 of that Act, orders pursuant to s 87 of that Act and consequential relief.
2 Subject to approval by the court, the proceeding was settled by an agreement between the parties made in December 2005.
By s 33V of the Federal Court Act, a representative proceeding may not be settled without the approval of the court.
The question which now arises is whether the settlement of December 2005 should be approved by the court.

 THE PARTIES AND THE CLAIMS 
 
 3 The proceeding concerns certain vitamins used in the production of animal feed and animal feed supplements.
Those vitamins, which have been referred to as 'class vitamins', are vitamins A, E, B1, B2, B5 and C, and Betacarotene and Canthaxanthin.
The respondents produced and distributed those vitamins, in ways to which I shall refer in more detail presently, within the period to which the proceeding relates, 5 March 1992 to 31 December 1999 ('the relevant period').
The applicants and the group members whom they represent, purchased and used those vitamins, or product containing those vitamins.
The applicants alleged that, during the relevant period, a cartel existed between various of the respondents which would otherwise have been in competition with each other which was calculated to maintain the prices of the relevant class vitamins at levels higher than would have obtained in the absence of the cartel.
4 Neither the applicants nor the group members which they represent were end consumers.
The first applicant was a purchaser of premix containing certain of the class vitamins for animal nutrition or health purposes, and was a grower of chicken meat for human consumption with its own feed milling facilities.
The second and third applicants were manufacturers, distributors and suppliers of premixes which contained class vitamins, and manufacturers and sellers of vitamins and mineral premixes for use in animal feed.
5 The group members are described as follows: 
 
 
 '(a) manufacturers, distributors and suppliers of pre-mixes containing vitamins A, E, B1, B2, B5, C, Betacarotene or Cantaxanthin for animal nutrition or health purposes (together and severally the 'class vitamins'); 
 (b) manufacturers , distributors and suppliers of stock feeds containing class vitamins; 
 (c) producers of livestock including poultry, pigs, sheep and cattle, and dairy farmers, egg producers and aquaculturalists, who purchased stock feeds containing class vitamins; 
 (d) manufacturers, distributors and suppliers of veterinary and performance enhancing preparations and supplements containing class vitamins; 
 (e) manufacturers and distributors of pet food containing class vitamins; 
 
 
 
 who: 
 
 (i) were at all relevant times ordinarily resident in or carrying on business in Australia; and 
 (ii) paid at least two thousand Australian dollars (AUD$2000.00) in the period 5 March 1992 to 31 December 1999 for class vitamins or pre-mix or other animal health or nutrition products containing class vitamins; and 
 (iii) are not Justices or Registrars of the High Court of Australia or the Federal Court of Australia.
" 


This description of the group members reflects what the evidence discloses to have been typical supply, acquisition and use arrangements in the industries in which the group members operated.
It seems that vitamins used in the animal feed chain were almost always first incorporated into premixes of which there were, I was told, hundreds of different formulations.
The appropriate premix was then selected for incorporation into stock feeds of various kinds.
Those stock feeds were in turn selected by livestock producers of the kind referred to in par (c) of the description of the group members.
In addition, appropriate premixes were selected by manufacturers of veterinary and performance enhancement preparations and supplements, and of pet food of various kinds.

 
 
 6 The respondents fall into three categories.
The first category are the 'Roche respondents', being four related companies ultimately owned by Roche Holding AG, a Swiss corporation.
F Hoffman-La Roche Ltd is a Swiss company which carried on business as a manufacturer and supplier of class vitamins in Switzerland, and which, on the applicants' allegations, co-ordinated and supervised the manufacture and supply of class vitamins in Switzerland and elsewhere in the world through related companies.
Roche Products Pty Ltd is an Australian company which imported class vitamins, and supplied them in Australia, save that, it alleges, between 1991 and 1998 it supplied class vitamins only to Roche Vitamins Australia Pty Ltd. That latter company is also a respondent and carried on business as a supplier of class vitamins (and, it alleges, premixes containing class vitamins) in Australia.
Roche Vitamins Asia Pacific Pte Ltd is alleged by the applicants (but it does not itself admit) to have been, since 3 April 1997, a supplier of class vitamins in Singapore to have co-ordinated and supervised the supply of class vitamins in the Asia Pacific region, including Australia.
7 The next category of respondents is what the applicants call the Aventis respondents.
Aventis SA is incorporated pursuant to the laws of France, and is the ultimate holding company of the other Aventis respondents.
The applicants allege that Aventis SA co-ordinated and supervised the manufacture and supply of class vitamins in France and elsewhere in the world through related companies, an allegation which is not admitted.
Aventis Animal Nutrition Pty Ltd is an Australian company which, according to the applicants' allegations, carried on business as an importer, packager and supplier of class vitamins in Australia and which, according to its own admissions, was an importer and supplier of class vitamins, and a manufacturer/packager and supplier of premix containing class vitamins.
Aventis Animal Nutrition SA is a French company which carried on business as a manufacturer and supplier of class vitamins in France and, according to the applicants, co-ordinated and supervised the manufacture and supply of class vitamins in France and elsewhere in the world through related companies.
Aventis Animal Nutrition Asia Pacific Pte Ltd is a Singaporean company which carried on business as a supplier of class vitamins in Singapore and, the applicants allege, which co-ordinated and supervised the supply of class vitamins in the Asia Pacific region, including Australia.
8 The third category is what the applicants called the BASF respondents.
BASF AG is a German company which was the ultimate holding company of the other BASF respondents, which carried on business as a manufacture and supplier of class vitamins (not including, according to its own admissions, the manufacture of vitamin B1 in the relevant period) in Germany and elsewhere and, according to the applicants, which co-ordinated and supervised the manufacture and supply of class vitamins in Germany and elsewhere in the world through related companies.
BASF Australia Ltd is an Australian company which carried on business as an importer and supplier (and, the applicants allege, packager) of class vitamins in Australia (excluding, according to its own admissions, Betacarotene) and, it alleges, was a packager of premix.
BASF East Asia Regional Headquarters Ltd is a Hong Kong company which, according to the applicants, carried on business as a supplier of class vitamins in Hong Kong and co-ordinated and supervised the supply of class vitamins in the East Asia region, including Australia, but which, according to itself, was a service company only.
9 Although the applicants' case as to the structure and operation of the three categories of respondents, and of the respondents themselves, is not wholly admitted, and although aspects of that case are denied, there are certain common features which may be regarded as having been established on the pleadings.
Within each corporate group, the ultimate holding company is incorporated in Europe and, by reason of that circumstance, may be assumed to exercise control over the other respondents in that group.
In each case there is a company established in the South East Asia region, although the significance to Australia, and actual role, of each such company remains controversial.
In each case there is at least one company operating in Australia, which, it is admitted, imported class vitamins and supplied them to the Australian market, and/or, in certain cases, incorporated them in premix which was, in turn, supplied to the Australian market.
This last aspect is significant for one element of the settlement.
As I have said above, Australian manufacturers of premixes containing class vitamins are group members in the proceeding.
10 The applicants allege that there were, during the relevant period, arrangements or understandings as between the European respondents, to maintain agreed market shares with respect to the class vitamins, to adhere to agreed prices and to supply the class vitamins in volumes that were agreed between them.
It is alleged that these agreements were made as between the European respondents with a view to being implemented in global markets.
The applicants allege that there was communication between the European respondents over the course of the relevant period in which they affirmed these arrangements or understandings, and in which they agreed to procure the implementation thereof by causing companies elsewhere in the world within the relevant corporate groups to observe them.
It is alleged that the arrangements or understandings, as made, had the purpose, and would have, or have been likely to have had, the effect of substantially lessening competition and, as given effect to from time to time, in fact had that purpose and had, or would have been likely to have had, that effect in each case contrary to relevant provisions of s 45(2) of the Trade Practices Act .
The applicants make a series of allegations, to which I need not refer further for present purposes, which would, if accepted, justify the conclusion that the conduct of which they complain occurred in Australia.
11 The applicants also alleged that the European respondents implemented the arrangements or understandings within the South East Asian region by causing the regional respondents, within their respect corporate groups, to observe them.
According to the applicants' allegations, the regional respondents were not involved (and it is not clear whether they existed) over the whole of the relevant period, the allegation in other respects being that the European respondents caused the arrangements and understandings to be implemented directly in Australia.
However, for part of the relevant period, the regional respondents were said to be involved in giving effect to the arrangements and understandings to which I have referred.
12 The applicants next allege that the Australian respondents reached their own arrangements and understandings for what was in effect a co-ordinated system of co-operation between them to confine themselves to agreed market shares, to observe prices for class vitamins which they had agreed between each other and to supply class vitamins only in agreed volumes.
It is also alleged that the Australian respondents agreed with each other, and with others, to implement in Australia the arrangements and understandings to which I have referred above, that is to say, those originating at the level of the European respondents and, for at least part of the relevant period, passed down the line by way of the regional respondents.
It is alleged that, in making and in subsequently giving effect to arrangements or understandings along these lines, the Australian respondents acted in contravention of s 45(2) of the Trade Practices Act .
13 The very brief survey of the applicants' allegations which I have just set out does less than complete justice to a lengthy and complex Statement of Claim.
In a contested proceeding, much greater care would need to be paid to each allegation, and to its relationship with other allegations.
It should not be assumed, from the survey I have given, that the applicants have treated the three groups of respondents identically as between each other.
Throughout the Statement of Claim there are differences in point of detail as between the groups of respondents, as between the respondents in each group and as between the allegations which relate to particular vitamins.
For present purposes, it is sufficient to note that systematic and co-ordinated global arrangements, implemented in Australia, by which the respondents agreed on market shares, prices and volumes have been alleged against them by the applicants.
Subject only to a possible qualification as to the application of the Trade Practices Act in the case of the respondents' conduct occurring outside Australia, there can be little doubt but that the applicants' allegations, if accepted, would amount to a serious contravention of s 45(2) of that Act.
14 In their defences, the respondents have made a number of admissions.
In no case is contravening conduct admitted with respect to the whole of the period for which the applicants sue.
However, in many cases, the admissions relate to a very substantial portion of that period.
The Roche respondents admit that there were arrangements of the kind alleged by the applicants at the global level in relation to all of the class vitamins, at the regional level in relation to five of the eight class vitamins, and at the Australian level in relation to vitamins A and E. The Aventis respondents admit that there were arrangements of that kind, for some of the relevant period, at all three levels but in relation to vitamins A and E only.
The BASF respondents admit to the existence of such arrangements at the global level for all vitamins except B1, and at the Australian level for vitamins A and E only.
15 When looked at within a purely Australian frame, the applicant has secured admissions from one respondent in each of the three corporate groups that arrangements or understandings of the kind alleged existed in Australia for a substantial part of the relevant period, but in relation to vitamins A and E only.
In other respects, there are no admissions as to arrangements and understandings occurring purely within Australia.
16 I should also mention at this stage that, on 28 February 2001, the court gave judgment in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Roche Vitamins Australia Pty Ltd (2001) 23 ATPR 42,806.
The applicant Commission ('the ACCC') had commenced proceedings under s 77 for penalties under s 76 of the Trade Practices Act against each of the three Australian respondents concerned in the present proceeding.
Each respondent admitted contraventions of s 45(2)(b) of that Act in relation to vitamins A and E, and joined with the ACCC in submitting that a penalty should be imposed.
Acting on those submissions, the court imposed penalties totalling $26m, and each respondent was ordered to pay $65,000 towards the ACCC's costs.
This event is relevant in the present proceeding because the applicants proposed to rely on s 83 of the Trade Practices Act , under which findings of fact made in those proceedings would be prima facie evidence in this proceeding.

 THE SETTLEMENT 
 
 17 Commencing in June 2005, the parties undertook settlement negotiations, culminating in a mediation which took place on 15 and 16 December 2005.
During the course of that mediation, the applicants accepted an offer from the respondents to settle the proceeding for the sum of $30.5m, plus costs of $10.5m.
The settlement was governed by 'heads of agreement' signed by the parties' solicitors on 16 December 2005, and was subject to the approval of the court.
The agreement, the operative provisions of which are set out in Schedule I to these reasons, provides for the establishment of an interest-bearing account, called the 'Vitamins Settlement Reserve Fund' ('the reserve fund'), into which the respondents would pay (and did pay) the total settlement of $41m by 13 January 2006.
The agreement provides that, if and when the court approved the settlement, the $10.5m costs figure will be paid to the applicants' solicitors, and the $30.5m settlement figure will be paid into an account called the 'Vitamins Settlement Distribution Fund' ('the distribution fund').
The interest which has been earned on the reserve fund, and that which will, after approval, be earned on the distribution fund, are to the extent necessary to be applied to the payment of disbursements incurred in connection with obtaining court approval of the settlement and of the costs of administering the settlement scheme to which I next refer.
18 The agreement provides for a settlement scheme pursuant to which the settlement sum of $30.5m will be applied and administered to the benefit of the applicants and the group members.
The settlement scheme is the responsibility of the applicants, but, under the agreement, the respondents were given the opportunity to comment on it.
The settlement distribution scheme was eventually finalised by the applicants on 10 July 2006.
It is reproduced in Schedule II to these reasons.
Significant features of it are as follows: 
 
 a.
What are described as 'reimbursement payments' are first to be paid from the settlement sum to group members nominated by name in the scheme.
The purpose of these payments is to reimburse two of the group members for their out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the prosecution of the proceeding, and to compensate seven of the group members for the time and effort which they have devoted to the proceeding on behalf of group members as a whole.
The total of these reimbursement payments, as amended shortly before the hearing of the applicants' motion, is $418,360.00.
b.
What remains of the settlement sum is then to be divided into two parts.
The first part, 7.0/30.5 of the fund, is to be allocated to a 'loss of market share fund' ('LMS fund').
The remaining part, 23.5/30.5 of the fund, is to be allocated to an 'overcharge fund'.
This division reflects the two main categories of damages which the applicants sought in the proceedings, to which I have referred above.
That is to say, the view was taken that, if the total settlement sum were notionally divided into 30.5 parts, 7.0 of those parts should be available as damages for those group members who lost market share as a result of the respondents' conduct, and 23.5 of those parts should be available as damages for those group members who were obliged to pay more for vitamins, and/or for products containing vitamins, as a result of the respondents' conduct.
There is, of course, no reason why a particular group member might not, depending on its circumstances, have legitimate claims under both categories.
c. A group member who manufactured premix containing class vitamins during the relevant period, and which makes a properly documented claim, is treated as a 'loss of market share' claimant (or 'LMS' claimant) and is entitled to participate in the LMS fund.
That entitlement is based directly upon the member's purchases of class vitamins during the relevant period and the purchases of class vitamins during that period by all LMS claimants.
In other words, the scheme in this respect is based upon an assumption that all manufacturers of premix will have lost some market share as a result of the respondents' conduct, and should share in the fund established for that purpose rateably according to their purchases of class vitamins.
d. The overcharge fund is available for distribution to all group members which have properly documented claims.
The distribution of the overcharge fund as between group members requires first the calculation, in respect of each group member, of a figure described as 'overcharge'.
That having been done, the overcharge fund is to be allocated between group members rateably according to their established purchases of vitamins or of products containing vitamins.
As will be seen from Table 1 in the settlement scheme, the ascertainment of the 'overcharge' involves the application to established purchases by each group member of a percentage factor which varies according to whether the group member was a premix manufacturer, a feed manufacturer, a livestock producer or an integrated livestock producer (or, in the case of the veterinary and pet food sectors: a manufacturer, distributor or supplier) and as to the particular industrial sector (or 'supply chain' as it is called) in which that group member operated.
The scheme does not provide details as to the derivation of the percentage factors (set out in the column headed 'Vitamin Cost and Absorption Rate'), but this has been dealt with comprehensively in the evidence before me, and I shall refer to it below.
e. The scheme will be administered by the applicants' solicitors.
A group member seeking to participate will be required to lodge a proof of claim form in accordance with that set out in Schedule A to the scheme.
The form is required to be accompanied by such invoices or other business records as are necessary to establish the claim.
f. The applicants' solicitors, as administrators under the scheme, will issue an assessment notice for each group member who lodges a claim.
If the group member wishes to dispute that assessment, there will be a review procedure involving recourse to a named 'independent counsel'.
Questions of law can be referred to the court.
g. The court is also given a role under the scheme if any issue arises in relation to the scheme, or the administration or the implementation of the scheme, and in connection with the possible extension of time limits set out in the scheme.

 THE PUBLICATION OF THE PROPOSED SETTLEMENT 
 
 19 On 11 July 2006, the applicants filed a Notice of Motion seeking inter alia orders for the publication to group members of a Notice of Proposed Settlement pursuant to s 33X(4) of the Federal Court Act.
I dealt with that motion in the orders made on 18 July 2006: see Darwalla Milling Co Pty Ltd v Hoffman-La Roche Ltd [2006] FCA 915.
That notice gave the group members an opportunity to object to the settlement, if they so desired, by notice sent to the court.
The court received no objections.
20 I am satisfied that the s 33X(4) notice to which I have referred was published in accordance with the orders made on 18 July 2006.
The applicants' solicitors took the following steps: 
 
 a.
On 19 July 2006, they sent to the group members registered with them (142 in total) a letter informing them of the fact of the settlement and attaching the s 33X notice and the proposed settlement scheme, including schedules.

 
 
 
 b.
They caused the s 33X notice to be published in the Adelaide Advertiser, the Brisbane Courier Mail, the Canberra Times, the Hobart Mercury, the Melbourne Hearld-Sun, the Northern Territory News, the West Australian, the Sydney Daily Telegraph and the Australian on 20 July 2006.

 
 
 
 c. They caused the s 33X notice to be published in Stock and Land (Vic), the Land (NSW), Stock Journal (SA), Farm Weekly (WA), North Queensland Register, Queensland Country Life and the Weekly Times on 27 July 2006.

 
 
 
 d. On 19 July 2006 they caused to be available on the internet a new domain, www.vitaminsettlement.com.au , which was linked to the vitamin class action page on their own website.

 
 
 
 e. On 19 July 2006 they caused to be loaded onto the vitamins class action page on their own website, a statement informing the reader that a settlement had been reached in the vitamins class action, and providing a link to a representation of each of the s 33X notice and the settlement distribution scheme.

 
 
 
 f. On 25 July 2006 they sent a letter to each of 49 industry associations which they had identified as being likely to have members that included group members, such letter advising the addressee that a settlement had been reached in the vitamins class action, that the settlement might affect the addressee's members and of certain basic features of the litigation and the settlement.
A copy of each of the s 33X notice and of the settlement scheme was attached to the letter.
The name and address of each of these industry associations is set out in a table contained in an exhibit to an affidavit upon which the applicants rely.

 
 
 
 g. On 17 July 2006 they caused to be issued to a number of major media organisations a press release headed '30.5 million dollar "vitamins" cartel class action for court approval'.
Although it is fair to say this document was promotional as well as informative, it was calculated to raise public awareness of the litigation and of the settlement.

 
 
 
 21 The fact and size of the settlement was the subject of an item on the 'PM' program on ABC national radio at about 6:30 pm on 17 July 2006.
Although the announcer described the litigation as 'Australia's first ever class action against a price fixing cartel', it is, I find, unlikely that this news item would have gone further than merely to raise awareness, amongst members of the public, of the litigation in a general sense.
It was not addressed to group members as such and there was nothing in it which is likely to have alerted a group member (otherwise only generally aware of the litigation) of the fact or purport of the s 33X notice.
22 By contrast, on 18 July 2006 at about 12:15 pm on the program 'SA Country Hour', the reporter said not only that Australia's first ever class action against a price fixing cartel had been settled, but also that many farmers could be eligible for compensation, that the respondents had agreed to pay $30.5m in damages, that, upon endorsement by the court, farmers, feed lotters and feed suppliers would be among those eligible to claim damages and that the lawyers were keen to hear from anyone who thought they were affected, it not being too late to join the claim.
The applicants' solicitor was interviewed on this program, and made it clear that persons who thought they were part of the group and had a claim should contact the solicitors and submit a proof of claim form.
23 On a television news item on 'WIN News' at about 6:10 pm on 14 August 2006, it was said that primary producers and businesses who lost money to a 'pharmaceutical price fixing cartel' were being called on to join a class action.
The announcer added that the court would decide whether to approve the settlement 'for those who purchased vitamins from the companies for stock feed and veterinary use'.
The reporter referred to the applicants' solicitors, and to their statement that it was now time for any producer who had spent more than $2,000 on relevant products to come forward.
The applicants' solicitor was also interviewed on this program, and she made it clear that qualifying group members could share in the settlement if it were approved.
24 In the period subsequent to 17 July 2006, the litigation, and the settlement, were frequently mentioned in the print media.
However, of the items which were put in evidence before the court, only two contained any comment which might excite the interest of group members to the prospect that they had the opportunity to become involved in the litigation and to put their claims forward (an item in the Sydney Morning Herald on 18 July 2006 headed 'Pharmaceutical Companies Settle First Cartel Class Action' and an item in the Adelaide Advertiser on 22 July 2006 headed 'Vitamins Settlement Businesses Can Claim').
25 Since the publication of the s 33X notice, the applicants' solicitors received about 30 inquiries from group members regarding the settlement.
Of these, about 20 were from group members who were already registered with the solicitors, and the remaining ten were new inquiries.
Various details were discussed and points of clarification dealt with.
The solicitors also spoke with certain of the larger group members regarding the settlement and distribution scheme.
The attitude of these group members towards the settlement was positive.
No-one expressed an objection to the settlement or the distribution scheme.
26 In considering the probable efficacy of the steps taken to publish the s 33X notice, and of the applicants' solicitors other steps calculated to publicise the facts of the litigation and of the settlement, I consider it significant that the group members were confined to businesses who had, over the relevant period, spent $2,000 or more upon vitamins or products containing vitamins, and did not include any end consumers.
I am prepared to assume that persons in business of a particular kind would be more likely, one way or another, to encounter the publications to which I have referred above, and to be, at least broadly, conscious of the significance of them to their own circumstances.
I also take into account the fact that the litigation has been on foot since 1999, and that the Australian respondents were the subject of orders by Lindgren J in the proceedings instituted by the ACCC to which I have referred in 2001.
27 The intent of the s 33X notices was to maximise the prospect that group members who had not previously made contact with the applicants' solicitors and who were otherwise not directly involved in the proceedings, would become aware of the settlement, have the means of accessing the terms of the settlement scheme, and be conscious of the opportunity available to them to object to the settlement or to the scheme.
I am satisfied that that objective has been substantially if not wholly achieved.
As I have noted above, there have been no objections lodged to the settlement or the settlement scheme.
In the circumstances, I infer that reasonable group members are at least broadly aware of the terms of the proposed settlement and are content with it.
That provides a powerful reason why I should approve the settlement, not only to the extent that it relates to the actual views of these group members, but also to the extent that absence of objections after wide publication of the terms of the settlement might be regarded as providing objective confirmation of the proposition which lies at the core of the applicants' case, namely, that the settlement is fair, reasonable and adequate in the interests of group members as a whole.
28 The notice under s 33X(4) informed group members that the applicants would seek the court's approval of the settlement on 31 August 2006, the adjourned date of the applicants' Notice of Motion of 11 July 2006.
On 31 August, the applicants moved the court to approve the settlement, and the orders which they sought in that regard were consented to by the respondents.
29 Mr Pagone QC, who appeared with Mr McArthur SC and Mr Armstrong for the applicants, submitted that the settlement was fair, reasonable and adequate in the interests of the group members as a whole and should, therefore, be approved.

 THE COURT'S APPROACH UNDER s 33V 
 
 30 In ACCC v Chats House Investments Pty Ltd (1996) 71 FCR 250, 258, Branson J considered that the purpose intended to be served by s 33V(1) of the Federal Court Act was obvious.
Her Honour said: 
 
 "It is appropriate for the Court to be satisfied that any settlement or discontinuance of representative proceedings has been undertaken in the interests of the group members as a whole, and not just in the interests of the applicant and the respondent.
" 
 

The context in which Branson J made this observation was not one where her Honour was exercising jurisdiction under s 33V.
Her Honour's observation has been referred to on a number of occasions since by Judges of the court, but not, so far as I can find, for the purpose of identifying a criterion by reference to which approval should be given, or declined.
Notwithstanding that circumstance, I consider, with respect, that Branson J accurately identified a consideration which must inform the exercise of the court's discretion under s 33V, namely, the need to protect the interests of group members as a whole, and to ensure that those interests are not subordinated to those of the actual parties in the proceeding.

 31 This kind of approach was also taken by Finkelstein J in Lopez v Star World Enterprises Pty Ltd [1999] FCA 104.
Having pointed out that the court's task was to assess whether the compromise, in that case, was fair and reasonable, his Honour continued (at [15]): 
 
 "I am not so much concerned with the position of [the applicant] who, after all, has solicitors and counsel to advise him as to how his interests will best be served in the litigation.
The group members are not protected in this way.
" 


 
In a passage which has been frequently referred to since, Finkelstein J pointed out that the court's task under s 33V was, for that reason, an onerous one (at [16]).

 32 In their written submissions in the present case, the applicants referred to Lopez , and also to the judgment of Goldberg J in Williams v FAI Home Security Pty Ltd (2000) 180 ALR 459.
His Honour said (at [19]): 
 
 "Ordinarily the task of a court upon an application such as this, is to determine whether the proposed settlement or compromise is fair and reasonable, having regard to the claims made on behalf of the group members who will be bound by the settlement.
Ordinarily in such circumstances the Court will take into account the amount offered to each group member, the prospects of success in the proceeding, the likelihood of the group members obtaining judgment for an amount significantly in excess of the settlement offer, the terms of any advice received from counsel and from any independent expert in relation to the issues which arise in the proceeding, the likely duration and cost of the proceeding if continued to judgment, and the attitude of the group members to the settlement.
In Re General Motors Corporation Pick-Up Truck Fuel Tank Products Liability Litigation 55 F 3d 768 at 785 the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit referred to the nine-factor test it had adopted: 
 
 "... to help district courts structure their final decisions to approve settlements as fair, reasonable and adequate as required by Rule 23(e) [which requires court approval for settlement of class actions].
See Girsh v Jepson 521 F 2d 153 at 157 (1975) (3d Cir).
Those factors are: (1) the complexity and duration of the litigation; (2) the reaction of the class to the settlement; (3) the stage of the proceedings; (4) the risks of establishing liability; (5) the risks of establishing damages; (6) the risks of maintaining a class action; (7) the ability of the defendants to withstand a greater judgment; (8) the range of reasonableness of the settlement in light of the best recovery; and (9) the range of reasonableness of the settlement in light of all the attendant risks of litigation.
