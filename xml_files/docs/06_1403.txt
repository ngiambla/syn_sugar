 INTRODUCTION 
 
 1 Pan Pharmaceuticals Limited was a substantial contract manufacturer of complementary medicines, or medicines that generally do not require prescription by a medical practitioner and can be obtained from retail outlets such as pharmacies, supermarkets and health food stores.
It held a licence pursuant to the regime established by the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 (Cth) (the TGA Act) and was obliged to comply with the requirements of the licence in manufacturing its products.
On 28 April 2003 the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) suspended the licence.
Pan could not manufacture or sell any more goods covered by the TGA Act and was obliged to recall goods it had sold.
The licence was never restored.
Pan became insolvent and was ultimately wound up.
2 The applicant, Australian Naturalcare Products Pty Ltd (Naturalcare), was one casualty of these events.
It sold complementary medicines by mail order.
It purchased most of its stock from Pan, and had done so for many years.
The recall of goods in stock, the inability of Pan to supply orders that had been accepted and the loss of Pan as a future supplier caused major disruption to its business.
Naturalcare lodged a proof of debt claiming a substantial sum to compensate for this disruption.
The liquidator has allowed amounts in relation to goods recalled and the failure to supply accepted orders but has denied liability otherwise.
Naturalcare sues for damages for the disruption to its business.
3 The essence of the case for Naturalcare is that, in one way or another, Pan guaranteed the continued supply of products that complied with TGA requirements.
Liability is put on various bases, including contract, tort, estoppel and breach of s 52 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth).
Each basis depends upon the course of business dealing between Naturalcare and Pan which commenced in 1989.

 BACKGROUND 
 Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 (Cth) and the therapeutic goods legislative regime 
 
 4 Until the TGA Act established the TGA, there was no single authority responsible for the regulation of therapeutic goods in Australia.
The objects of the TGA Act are set out in s 4 and include the provision of a national framework for the regulation and control of therapeutic goods and medical devices to ensure their safety, quality, efficacy and timely availability to consumers.
5 A 'therapeutic good' under the TGA Act is broadly defined as a good which is represented in any way to be, or is likely to be taken to be, for therapeutic use (unless specifically excluded or included under s 7 of the TGA Act, which provides for a declaration that goods are or are not therapeutic goods by the Secretary of the Department of Health and Aging).
'Therapeutic use' is defined in s 3 of the TGA Act.
6 The TGA Act applies to therapeutic goods used in Australia (whether produced in Australia or elsewhere) and to therapeutic goods that are exported from Australia.
It sets out the legal requirements for manufacturing, supplying and importing of medicines into Australia as well as the requirements for listing or registering all medicines on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods (the Register).
It also regulates advertising, labelling and product appearance.
The TGA Act is supplemented by regulations and various orders and determinations.
The Australian Code of Good Manufacturing Practice for Therapeutic Goods --- Medicinal Products (the Code) is of particular importance in this case.
7 The Register was established under Pt 3 of the TGA Act.
The Register is a database of information about therapeutic goods for human use which are approved for supply in, or export from, Australia.
Any product claiming to have therapeutic qualities must either be listed or registered in the Register before it can be supplied in Australia, unless it is specifically excluded or exempt.
As a general rule, higher risk medicines are registered and lower risk medicines are listed.
The assessment of a product's 'risk' will largely depend on its ingredients, its form of dosage and the promotional or therapeutic claims made for the product.
Many complementary medicines are listed in the Register and some are registered.
8 The application to have a product listed or registered is made by a 'sponsor'.
Under s 3 of the TGA Act, a sponsor is someone who imports, exports, manufactures or has therapeutic goods imported or manufactured on its behalf, but does not include someone who arranges or personally imports, exports or manufactures therapeutic goods on behalf of another if that person is a resident of, or carrying on business in, Australia.
To apply for registration, a sponsor needs to supply product specifications and analytical reports.
Necessary product specifications include the formula (generally by way of a formulation certificate), the ingredients including quantities, the size and shape of the pill and a copy of the proposed label.
The analytical report identifies the ingredients and their strength and how this supports the therapeutic claims made on the product's behalf.
9 A sponsor's product must be manufactured by an authorised manufacturer in order for the product to be registered.
All applications by sponsors of a proposed therapeutic good must specify which approved manufacturer is to produce the product if registration is to be successful.
Australian manufacturers of therapeutic goods have to be licensed under Pt 4 of the TGA Act.
Manufacturers must also comply with the principles of the Code.
Clause 699 of the Code states: 
 
 'To ensure that the responsibilities of both parties are clearly understood and recorded, the arrangements and responsibilities for every aspect of manufacture and quality control that is relevant to Good Manufacturing Practice, for each product made under contract, must be unambiguously specified in writing in a "Specification of GMP Responsibilities", or equivalent document, signed by a representative of both parties ...' 
 
 
 10 Naturalcare (as sponsor) and Pan (as manufacturer) entered into a series of GMP or Manufacturing Agreements to satisfy the requirements of cl 699.
Those Manufacturing Agreements are outlined in greater detail below.

 Pan 
 
 11 Selim was the Chief Executive Officer, a director and a shareholder of Pan Laboratories Pty Limited from the time it was established in 1974 until 1999.
In 1999, the manufacturing business conducted by Pan Laboratories Pty Limited was transferred to Pan Laboratories (Australia) Pty Limited (which was renamed Jimang Pty Limited on 2 February 2000) and was carried on by it until March 2000 when the business was transferred to Pan Pharmaceuticals Limited.
From 1999 to 2000, Selim was the Chief Executive Officer, a director and a majority shareholder of Pan Laboratories (Australia) Pty Limited.
When Pan Pharmaceuticals Limited was listed on the Australian Stock Exchange on 23 August 2000, Selim became the Chief Executive Officer, a director and the majority shareholder of the company.
Hereafter, 'Pan' refers to whichever entity was conducting the manufacturing business from 1974 to April 2003 except where it becomes necessary to distinguish between the corporate entities.
12 Selim's job involved day to day contact with sponsors to encourage them to buy Pan's new and existing products.
Between 1974 and 1988 he was the only person at Pan working in a marketing position.
Between 1990 and 2003, he was the head of Pan's Marketing  Sales and Exports departments with a number of Marketing  Sales Managers reporting to him.
He claimed to have a number of formal qualifications relevant to his position including a Bachelor of Pharmacy, a Diploma of Food and Drug Analysis, a Master of Science (Organic Chemistry), a Diploma of Herbology and a Ph.D. in Nutrition.
13 Pan was audited by the TGA in February 1995, November 1995, April 1997 and November 1998.
A number of compliance issues were raised in these audits, particularly in the November 1998 audit report.
However, Pan remained licensed.

 Naturalcare 
 
 14 Schadel became involved with complementary medicines in 1979 when he was employed as the North Coast Sales Representative for a range of health food products manufactured by a company called Pretorius Pty Ltd.
In 1985 or thereabouts he was appointed as the General Manager of Balance Sports Supplements which had an established relationship with Pan.
Schadel met Selim and dealt with him directly in negotiating product development and manufacturing processes between the two companies.
In 1987, Schadel became the Sales and Marketing Manager of a business trading under the name of Weider Health and Fitness.
15 In 1989, with encouragement from Selim, Schadel started his own business known as Styjive Pty Limited from 1989 to 1991 and Australian Naturalcare Products Pty Ltd thereafter, herein referred to as 'Naturalcare'.
Schadel and his wife were initially the sole shareholders of Naturalcare.
The company started with only one product called Royal Jelly which was supplied by Pan but initially sourced from overseas as Pan did not have the technology to manufacture it at that time.

 Business relationship between Naturalcare and Pan 
 
 16 The business relationship between Naturalcare and Pan was first formalised when the companies entered into a Manufacturing Agreement as required by the Code in 1990.
Both Selim and Schadel agreed that the companies were parties to this agreement although a copy was not available to tender in the proceedings.
The form and content of the successive Manufacturing Agreements will therefore be discussed in greater detail in the context of those agreements which are in evidence.
17 The business relationship between the two companies was fostered by a close professional and personal relationship between Selim and Schadel who worked together on the development of Naturalcare's business, particularly in the early years of their dealings.
They met at least once every three months, and probably more often, for three to four hours at a time.
Selim and Schadel continued to have regular, though less frequent, meetings until April 2003.
At the meetings, Selim proposed new products and discussed their formulas and benefits, as well as discussing business more generally.
18 In the early 1990s, Selim actively encouraged Schadel to expand Naturalcare's product range.
Schadel remembered having conversations with Selim at this time in words to the following effect: 
 
 'Mr Selim: "I think it's time for you to introduce several new products so you can compete against Hilton Lifestream, which is Australia's oldest mail-order company.
I have first-hand knowledge of the best product range for a mail order business like [Naturalcare] .
I can give you a list of suggested products that are selling well that your customers would like.
" 
 Me [Schadel] : "I accept that we need new products, but at the moment we don't have the cash to purchase so many products at once.
" 
 Mr Selim: "I can offer you extended credit until you get established in the future.
" ' 
 
 
 
 19 Selim would suggest which products should be added to Naturalcare's range.
If Schadel was interested in the product he would ask Selim to send him a quote and if Schadel found it satisfactory, he would send Pan a purchase order.
Selim agreed that they worked 'closely and collaboratively' to develop Naturalcare's business.
As a result of that practice, Naturalcare's range expanded beyond Royal Jelly to include products such as Korean Ginseng, Evening Primrose Oil, Arizona Odourless Garlic, Vitamin E, Vitamin C and Multivitamin and Mineral.
By the end of 1992 or thereabouts, Naturalcare offered its customers approximately 26 separate complementary products.
To the best of Schadel's recollection, Selim had suggested all of them and Selim did not deny that this could have been the case.
Selim encouraged Naturalcare to purchase all of its product from Pan.
20 Selim provided financial as well as technical assistance to help Naturalcare expand its range in the early years.
Schadel claimed that from 1989 to 1994, Naturalcare received monthly invoices from Pan but would only partially pay selected invoices at the end of the month, irrespective of the total amount owing.
Selim agreed that he offered Naturalcare favourable credit terms but added that from about the early 1990s, Naturalcare was required to pay within 45 days for repeat products and only allowed to delay payment on new products.
Schadel claimed the credit terms encouraged him to buy products he may not otherwise have bought and also to continue to purchase almost 100 per cent of Naturalcare's product from Pan until around March 1994.
Schadel gave evidence that Naturalcare consistently owed hundreds of thousands of dollars to Pan during this period.
It suffices to hold that considerable credit was advanced by Pan to Naturalcare.
21 Selim also offered Naturalcare assistance in registering products with the TGA including the preparation of product specifications, formulation certificates and initially on the labelling or packaging details for new Naturalcare products.
Pan also sent relevant paperwork to the TGA directly on Naturalcare's behalf until the mid 1990s, although Selim denies that it was Pan's practice to lodge an application for listing or registration with the TGA on behalf of Naturalcare.
Schadel claimed that if the TGA had any queries in relation to ingredients of products or registration requirements, the TGA called Pan, or Naturalcare and then Pan, although Selim denies that the TGA addressed such queries to Pan rather than Naturalcare in its capacity as a sponsor.
Again, it suffices to hold that Pan gave considerable assistance to Naturalcare in relation to sponsorship of products.
Once a product was registered, Pan manufactured the product for Naturalcare (if Naturalcare submitted an appropriate order) and the product was then added to Naturalcare's product range.
22 The usual modus operandi of supply was that Naturalcare sent Pan a purchase order and Pan sent back confirmation if it could source the relevant raw materials and fill the order.
A purchase order usually set out the manufacturer's name and address, the sponsor's name and address, the sequence number of the order, the product name and Pan's formula code for the product, a quantity of product, the price of the product (taken by the mid 1990s from an annual price list supplied to Naturalcare to be discussed below), the total amount payable for the order, the required delivery date, and the place of delivery.
Pan informed its sponsors of its policy that purchase orders were to be submitted by the tenth day of each month and Pan would then attempt to deliver the goods by the end of the following month.
Pan usually ordered its raw materials by the fifteenth day of each month.
If it could not source the raw materials required to produce the product, Pan's practice was to withhold confirmation of the purchase order by not issuing an order confirmation.
Schadel programmed in a lead time of three months in case of such eventualities, when for example, the product had to be sourced internationally.
If the price of a product had changed since the issue of the annual price list, Pan would send the confirmation order back to Naturalcare stating the new price.
If Pan did not receive a response within a couple of days of sending the confirmation order it would begin to process it.
23 Pan normally required Naturalcare to purchase prescribed batch sizes.
The size of the minimum batches increased over the years, as did Pan's commitment to enforcing the policy.
Selim helped Naturalcare on several occasions by agreeing for Pan to do an early or special production run for Naturalcare.
However, Schadel wanted to find a way to test new products on the market without having to pay the costs involved in filling Pan's minimum production runs.
In about 1992, Selim suggested that he should contact a Mr Sid Sarantis, the owner of a company called Markethaven Pty Limited.
The company did contract packaging and also bought Pan products to sell to supermarkets.
Schadel said Selim suggested: 
 
 ' "He [Sarantis] could supply you my products for testing from batches ordered by him and then, if your customers like that product, you may buy a full batch run from Pan in the future.
" ' 
 

Selim gave evidence that he introduced Schadel and Sarantis because Schadel wanted to find a company to do smaller packaging runs rather than smaller purchase runs.
On any view, it is clear that Schadel contacted Sarantis as a consequence of Selim's recommendation in about 1992 or 1993.
Naturalcare then developed a relationship with Markethaven.
Markethaven became Naturalcare's packaging agent and the two companies signed a Packaging Agreement in 1997.
Markethaven packaged product from both Pan and other manufacturers for Naturalcare.
Schadel and Sarantis also made oral arrangements to split orders from Pan so that Naturalcare periodically bought a percentage of Pan product from Markethaven.

 24 On a number of occasions throughout the relevant period Selim said that he wanted Naturalcare to be Pan's biggest mail order outlet.
From time to time, Selim described Naturalcare as 'Pan's mail order arm'.
Selim encouraged Naturalcare to look into selling its products into international markets and promised to help Naturalcare with the supporting documentation required to register products overseas.
I am satisfied that at all times Schadel reposed considerable trust and confidence in Selim personally and from a business point of view.
25 Naturalcare ordered its complementary medicines from Pan in the form of either 'soft gels' or tablets.
Schadel described soft gels in the following way: 
 
 'Soft gel describes the capsule containing the product.
Soft gel products attract a premium in the market place.
Benefits include being easier to swallow and thus more attractive to consumers, especially mail order customers who are predominantly elderly.
It is also a superior means of delivering a therapeutic product as it is ordinarily easier to swallow and digest a soft gel tablet than it is a hard tablet.
' 
 
 
 26 Pan imported soft gels from overseas until about 1994 when it started manufacturing them locally.
The only company with the technology to make them in Australia up until this time was R P Scherer.
From 1994 onwards, Pan's principal competitor for the soft gel market was R P Scherer.
27 Products were described by the parties as being either 'generic' or 'non-generic'.
Schadel described a generic product in the following way: 
 
 '... say, vitamin E or evening primrose oil, which is products that everyone in the market has.
Virtually --- or fish oil would be a good example, virtually single ingredient product, 1000 milligram fish oil.
Every sponsor has it ...' 
 

Selim's description was as follows:
 
 'A generic product is a soft gel or tablet product that has been in the market for some time and was sold by Pan to a number of sponsors.
... 
 A non-generic product is a soft gel or tablet product typically developed by Pan for [Naturalcare] or developed by [Naturalcare] in consultation with Pan.
A non-generic product developed by Pan for [Naturalcare] was typically sold to [Naturalcare] exclusively for a period before release to any of Pan's sponsors.
' 
 

Naturalcare's tablet product range was principally composed of generic products.

 28 By March 1994, Naturalcare found itself with a large quantity of unsold stock and owing Pan a debt of around $420 000.
Naturalcare could not go on without an injection of equity.
During the year, Schadel therefore negotiated the sale of 65 per cent of Naturalcare's issued shares to Cellarmasters Wines Pty Limited with an option to acquire a further 10 per cent, which was exercised in 1995.
Schadel retained his position as Managing Director.
29 Mr Terry Davis, the then Executive Director of Cellarmasters, told Schadel that he would like to investigate alternative suppliers for Naturalcare's generic products as he was concerned about the company's reliance on Pan.
As a consequence, Schadel contacted Lipa Pharmaceuticals Pty Ltd to obtain tentative quotes for supply of certain generic products.
30 Schadel, Davis and Selim had two meetings in 1995/1996 where Davis voiced his concerns to Selim.
Davis said that at one of the meetings a conversation took place to the following effect: 
 
 
 
 'Me [Davis] : "How can I be certain you can supply all our product at the right quality and competitive prices as you want all our business?
Given your current and past issues with the Therapeutic Goods people where do you stand with a clean bill of health and who could we turn to if you were not able to supply?
" 
 Mr Schadel: "Jim, you have to give Terry confidence that all the commitments you have made to me that you can deliver on them, particularly in respect of new products, pricing and continuous supply.
" 
 Mr Selim: "You have nothing to worry about.
[Naturalcare] can continue to buy all of its products from Pan without a worry.
Pan is the largest manufacturer of health care products in Australia.
Pan complies with all of the TGA's requirements so there is no risk in Pan not being able to supply [Naturalcare] .
There is no problem in Pan continuing to supply [Naturalcare] .
" ' 
 
 
 
 

Schadel said that the conversations included words to the following effect:
 
 'Mr Davis: "Jim, I am extremely concerned that [Naturalcare's] business is totally reliant on Pan for the majority of its best-selling products.
I have asked Barry to continue to try to source products from other manufacturers.
" 
 Me [Schadel] : "Jim, I have told Terry many times about our long term relationship and the fact that I believe Pan is still the major manufacturer in Australia but we are both concerned that [Naturalcare] has become totally reliant on Pan.
" 
 Mr Selim: "You have nothing to worry about.
[Naturalcare] can continue to buy all of its products from Pan without a worry.
Pan is the largest manufacturer of health care products in Australia.
Pan complies with all of the TGA's requirements so there is no risk in Pan not being able to supply [Naturalcare] .
There is no problem in Pan continuing to supply [Naturalcare] .
" 
 Mr Davis: "For example, what would happen if government intervention closed your plant?
" 
 Mr Selim: (laughing) "That would never happen.
Pan is Australia's number one manufacturer and is TGA compliant.
" ' 
 
 

Selim said that the conversation was to the following effect:
 
 
 
 'Mr Davis: " [Naturalcare] is looking to diversify its suppliers of generic products, and I am encouraging Barry to source product from other suppliers.
" 
 Me [Selim] : "What about our relationship, Barry?
What about our history?
We have together formulated [Naturalcare's] top sellers.
Pan has helped to build your business.
" 
 Mr Schadel: "Can Pan cope with supplying all of [Naturalcare's] products?
Does Pan have the production capacity?
" 
 Me [Selim] : "Yes, Pan has the production capacity to manufacture all of [Naturalcare's] products.
[Naturalcare] should get 100% of its products from Pan and we should continue to work together to develop new products.
Other sponsors which are much larger than [Naturalcare] , such as Bullivants, get all of their products from Pan with no problem.
" 
 Mr Schadel: "Pan needs to be competitive on price.
" 
 Me [Selim] : "Yes, Pan will stay competitive on price, but it is not a charity.
" ' 
 
 
 
 
 
 31 Selim denied that the TGA was mentioned in the conversation, or that he said the phrase 'nothing to worry about' and asserted that the focus of the discussion was the capacity of Pan to supply a number of big customers as well as Naturalcare at the same time.
I accept the evidence of Davis.
He was not cross examined.
He is now independent of the parties and had no reason to give false evidence.
His evidence is broadly consistent with and corroborates that of Schadel.
I find that Schadel and Davis relied upon and continued to rely upon the assurances given by Selim.
32 At one of the meetings with Davis and Selim, Davis suggested the possibility of Pan paying Naturalcare a 2.5 per cent advertising rebate on all Naturalcare's purchases from Pan so that Naturalcare did not bear all the risk on new products.
Selim agreed to grant Naturalcare an advertising rebate of 2.5 per cent of annual sales and $1000 for every new product introduced.
Schadel remembers Selim saying words to the following effect: 
 
 'Barry, this rebate must remain confidential between us as it is something that I don't do for any other company.
I'm only doing it for [Naturalcare] to help us grow the business together.
' 
 

A fax from Schadel to Selim dated 31 May 1996 states the following:
 
 'With regards to our loyalty rebates for 1996/97, I would like to confirm that our existing loyalty arrangement will continue to operate over the next year as our purchase's may exceed the $2 million dollar mark.
' 
 

The advertising rebate arrangement continued until about 2001.

 33 Schadel stated that after the meetings with Davis and Selim, Naturalcare nonetheless began placing more of its orders for generic products with Lipa when Lipa could offer a better price than Pan.
On 10 December 1997, Naturalcare and Lipa signed a Manufacturing Agreement.
Schadel also made enquiries during the course of 1995 about the possibility of purchasing soft gel products from R P Scherer but was informed that Naturalcare would be required to appoint R P Scherer as Naturalcare's main supplier of other products if the two companies were to do business.
Naturalcare continued to purchase the bulk of its products from Pan.
34 As noted above, Pan sent Naturalcare a price list to act as a guide for the following year (although prices did fluctuate to some degree because of changes in the price of raw materials).
The list would set out the names, product codes and prices for all the products Pan was supplying to Naturalcare at that time.
Schadel claimed that to the best of his recollection the price lists were provided in response to his request for greater price certainty because Naturalcare promised its customers a fixed yearly price.
Selim recalled the request but claimed that price lists were provided to all sponsors.
There is no reason to doubt Selim on that point.
35 Selim denied that he ever had a conversation with Schadel in which Naturalcare promised to pay the price stipulated in the annual price list, or if not stipulated, a reasonable price, as Schadel was told the prices on the list were subject to change.
Schadel agreed in cross-examination that the negotiation of prices was an ongoing affair.
He said: 
 
 '... Mr Selim likewise reserved the right to increase his prices at any point in time or decrease his prices ...
The arrangement was flexible.
' 
 
 
 36 Selim also denied that Naturalcare was under any obligation to buy the products on the list as some of the products were not ordered for some time and were effectively 'inactive'.
Schadel admitted in cross examination that Naturalcare had bought products from manufacturers apart from Pan.
Naturalcare therefore did not confine its purchasing to products on Pan's price lists.
37 Selim also denied that Schadel ever promised to attempt to ensure that Naturalcare purchased goods from Pan of an average annual value not less than the preceding annual value of goods purchased from Pan.
Schadel admitted under cross examination that he could not recall a conversation in which such a promise was made.
However, if Naturalcare placed an order for product that Pan had quoted Naturalcare for in the past, Pan would supply the product if it had the relevant raw materials and the order was for the required minimum batch run.
38 On 10 February 1995, Pan and Naturalcare signed another Manufacturing Agreement.
It included the following clauses: 
 
 '1.
Objective: This document specifies the Code of Good Manufacturing Practice responsibilities relating to the manufacture of the products listed in Annexure 1 of this Contract for Australian Natural Care Products (herein referred to as "Natural Care") by Pan Laboratories (Australia) Pty.
Ltd. (herein referred to as "Pan").
These responsibilities refer to the numbered clauses in the Code of Good Manufacturing Practice for Therapeutic Goods, August 1990.

 2.
Operation: Products manufactured and packed in final containers by Pan.

 3.
Confidentiality: Formulation supplied for purposes of this Agreement are considered confidential and are not to be supplied by any third party other than with Pan's written consent.

 4.
Term: This Agreement shall continue in operation for three (3) years, and will be deemed automatically renewed for a further three (3) years at the end of each three (3) year period.
Either party shall determine otherwise by giving six (6) months notice in writing to the other party of their intent to terminate the Agreement.

 5.
Scope: This Agreement does not cover any other commercial arrangements.
' 
 
 

A significant purpose of the Manufacturing Agreement was to allocate the statutory responsibility under the Code.
It included a table which set out relevant clauses of the Code, the responsibilities those clauses are concerned with, and which of the two companies was to undertake each responsibility.
This table was followed by Annexure 1 described in a sub heading as '(List of Products)'.
This document appeared in identical form in subsequent Manufacturing Agreements but was referred to as 'Appendix 1 and will be referred to as such hereafter.
There are 15 products in Appendix 1 of the 1995 Manufacturing Agreement.
There was no provision in the Manufacturing Agreement in relation to commercial arrangements for the supply of goods.
There was no obligation to order or supply any particular goods on any particular terms.

 39 A further agreement was made in August 1998.
That Manufacturing Agreement was in similar form to the 1995 Manufacturing Agreement with a few minor amendments.
There were 67 products in Appendix 1 of the 1998 Manufacturing Agreement.
40 Schadel described the Appendix 1 product lists as 'fluid' in that they showed products Naturalcare had received quotes for but never introduced into its range, products that were introduced but which failed, and products that Naturalcare continued to order.
The list also excluded products that had been introduced shortly before the Manufacturing Agreements were signed.
Schadel said that he did not feel under an obligation to purchase the products on the various Appendix 1 documents from Pan if Pan's prices were not competitive.
However he did believe that Pan was under an obligation to supply Naturalcare with a product, even if Naturalcare had only ordered it once.
41 Naturalcare and Pan also signed a Confidentiality Agreement in February 1995 and in August 1998 in similar form.
42 In mid 1998, Cellarmasters sold its shares in Naturalcare to Amrion Inc, a manufacturer of therapeutic goods based in the Unites States of America.
Amrion came to own 90 per cent of Naturalcare's issued shares although Schadel retained his position as Managing Director.
Mr David Robinson, a director of Amrion, became a director of Naturalcare in about July 1998 and retained this position until about November 2000.
He gave evidence that he travelled to Australia on two occasions to have meetings with Schadel to evaluate Amrion's ownership of Naturalcare and analyse the company's business opportunities and weaknesses.
At one of these meetings Robinson claims he had a conversation with Schadel with words to the following effect: 
 
 'Me [Robinson] : " [Naturalcare] appears to be very dependent on Pan Laboratories for the supply of the majority of your products.
I am concerned about what happens to [Naturalcare] if that supply is cut off or interrupted?
" 
 Mr Schadel: "Pan Labs is the largest manufacturer of nutritional supplements in Australia.
Almost every company in our industry is buying from Pan.
They have a great reputation for quality.
I don't think there is any chance they would not be able to supply [Naturalcare] .
" ' 
 
 
 43 Robinson, Schadel and Selim had a meeting as to the substance of which all three men gave evidence.
Robinson said the relevant conversation was to the following effect: 
 
 'Me [Robinson] : " [Naturalcare] buys a significant amount of product from Pan Labs.
If you were not able to supply [Naturalcare] , even temporarily, it would have a seriously negative affect on our business.
" 
 Mr Selim: "You do not need to worry about that.
Pan is the largest supplier of nutritional supplements in Australia.
There is no possibility that Pan won't be able to supply [Naturalcare] with the products they order.
Further, as Pan is the largest supplier in Australia, we work closely with the TGA and we meet, or exceed, all necessary standards the TGA sets for the manufacture of nutritional supplements.
" ' 
 
 

Schadel said Robinson said words to the following effect:
 
 ' [Naturalcare] is overly reliant on Pan.
I think that we will be seeking to diversify its suppliers.
' 
 

Schadel said Selim's reply was to the following effect:
 
 'There is no risk of Pan ceasing supply.
Pan has helped build [Naturalcare] .
Our relationship extends beyond simply supplying goods --- it extends into other areas including constant product development.
We have built the business together and we should stay together.
' 
 

Selim said the conversation included words to the following effect:
 
 'Mr Robinson: "I'm telling Barry he should source products from other suppliers.
" 
 Me [Selim] : "There is no problem in Pan continuing to supply [Naturalcare] .
Pan has the capacity to meet all of [Naturalcare's] production needs.
Pan has not let you down.
For products you have ordered, Pan has supplied.
" 
 Mr Robinson: "Yes, Pan has looked after [Naturalcare] .
" ' 
 
 
 44 I accept the evidence of Robinson.
He was not cross-examined and there is no reason to doubt his reliability.
His evidence is broadly consistent with and corroborates that of Schadel.
I find that Robinson and Schadel relied and continued to rely upon Selim's assurances.
45 Amrion had a plan to distribute its products, manufactured in a factory in Colorado, USA, to the Australian market by using Naturalcare's client list.
However, the TGA did not grant Amrion the appropriate accreditation and in May 2001, Amrion sold its shares in Naturalcare back to Schadel and his wife, who became the sole shareholders of the company again.
46 In around 1999 or 2000, Pan had developed a new formulation for glucosamine sulphate to relieve arthritic pain.
The formulation was approved by the TGA and Naturalcare sold it under the name 'Healthy Joints'.
In about September 2001, Selim and Schadel had a meeting in which Schadel told Selim that he was planning to have Healthy Joints manufactured by Lipa because Lipa could supply it for a lower price.
Schadel and Selim remembered this conversation differently.
Schadel recalled Selim getting out of his chair, pacing to the other side of the desk and raising his voice 'to almost screaming pitch' when he said words to the following effect: 
 
 'Healthy Joints is my formulation.
You have no right to give it to another manufacturer.
If you do, I will sue you!
If you decide to fight me it will cost you a lot of money and I will win.
' 
 

Schadel claimed he was 'extremely shocked and fearful' because of Selim's reaction and replied with words to the following effect:
 
 'Jim, I am not giving them your formulation.
Lipa is reformulating to their own specifications from our label claim.
You know it's a major price issue for us.
The product is so much more expensive from you.
And you've always told me that you would meet their prices.
' 
 

Schadel gave evidence that Selim went on to say:
 
 'Enjoy the prices from Lipa now because as he grows he will have to deal with the same overheads I have had to deal with and he won't be able to compete with me once he gets as big as Pan.
' 
 

Schadel also claimed Selim said words to the following effect:
 
 'I insist that all new products which Pan has offered to [Naturalcare] in the past stay with Pan in the future.
' 
 

Schadel claimed that while he was 'very mindful' of Selim's threat to sue, he continued to seek quotes from other manufacturers for products apart from soft gels as he believed Pan was overcharging Naturalcare for the majority of their products compared to Lipa.
Selim denied that he threatened to sue Naturalcare and claimed that he responded to Schadel's announcement by saying it was 'disappointing'.

 47 Despite this incident, Naturalcare and Pan continued to work together.
In March 2002, Pan and Naturalcare entered into another Manufacturing Agreement and another Confidentiality Agreement.
The Confidentiality Agreement was in the same terms as before.
The March 2002 Manufacturing Agreement was in the same form as the 1998 Manufacturing Agreement.
There were 103 products in Appendix 1 of the 2002 Manufacturing Agreement.
48 Schadel gave evidence that in relation to the period of January 2000 to April 2003, he understood that Pan was to supply 'close to all' of Naturalcare's soft gel product requirements and the 'majority of all other goods sold'.
When Counsel for Pan put it to Schadel that in reality Pan only supplied 52.5 per cent by volume and 42.8 per cent by value of Naturalcare's soft gel product in this period and only 44.5 per cent by value of Naturalcare's other products, Schadel said 'I don't know whether those figures are correct.'.
The figures appear in a statement by one of Pan's liquidators, Mr Christopher John Honey, who caused a purchasing analysis to be conducted by Gary Busby, Bian Guan Lim and persons under their direction and under his supervision.
Mr Bradley James Stuart, the financial controller of Naturalcare gave evidence based on a review of Naturalcare's MYOB database that for the financial years ending 30 June 2002 and 30 June 2003, Pan supplied Naturalcare with approximately 66 per cent of Naturalcare's total stock purchases; and with 98 per cent of its total soft gel purchases.
A difference in the figures could be the result of Stuart including product that was indirectly sourced from Pan, for example if Markethaven bought product from Pan and packaged it for Naturalcare under their Packaging Agreement.
Schadel certainly reserved the freedom to acquire products from other manufacturers if the price was more favourable than Pan's price.
49 The business relationship between Schadel and Selim continued to function.
In late 2002, Selim offered to introduce Schadel to a Mr Derek Coates as a possible buyer of Naturalcare when Schadel expressed a desire to sell the company.
In February 2003, Selim told Schadel that he thought there was an opening in the market for a pharmacy only brand which Naturalcare could fill by selling its existing range under another label.
In the same month, Selim told Schadel that he should relaunch his business in the French market and that Pan would give him extended credit terms and free product to help him with the venture.
Selim expected that the relationship whereby Pan supplied Naturalcare with a large portion of its therapeutic goods would continue indefinitely into the future.

 Travacalm incident and thereafter 
 
 50 In early 2003 there were reports of adverse reactions after individuals took Travacalm, one of Pan's products.
As a result, the TGA conducted a special GMP audit of Pan between 30---31 January 2003.
The TGA's report, dated 5 February 2003, listed the objectives of the audit as follows: 
 
 
 '(i) To investigate possible-probable causes of the recent recall(s) of "Travacalm Original" (Aust R 78192) and "Travacalm HO" (Aust R 68450).
These batches were recalled because of a series of adverse reactions and (confirmed) and unacceptable variation in the concentration of the Hyoscine Hydrobromide within individual tablets; 
 and 
 (ii) To assess compliance with the Manufacturing Principles, the above referenced Manufacturing Standard, the conditions specified in the company's Licence to Manufacture Therapeutic Goods, and compliance with the relevant marketing authorisation(s).
' 
 
 
 

The report went on to note:
 
 'The audit revealed a number of significant deficiencies, including three items classified as critical.
As indicated during the inspection, these deficiencies were to be referred to the Chief GMP Auditor and a Section Review Panel for further consideration, including the possibility of amendment, suspension or revocation of the company's licence.
' 
 

The report noted a number of 'possible-probable' causes of the recall(s) of 'Travacalm Original' (Aust R 78192) and 'Travacalm HO' (Aust R 68450).
The report then added the following by way of conclusion:
 
 
 '... the audit revealed compelling evidence: 
 (i) That the organisation was actually aware, following the analysis of the first batch of Travacalm, that the product failed to meet the requirement for "Uniformity of Content".
