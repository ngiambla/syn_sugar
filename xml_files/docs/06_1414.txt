1 John Wycliffe --- the 'Morning Star of the Reformation' --- was one of the most important figures in English theology.
Living in the fourteenth century in the depths of the Middle Ages, he became an Oxford don and a popular reformer.
His progressive and outspoken political and theological views led to frequent clashes with the church and the university.
2 Wycliffe was critical of the church hierarchy --- monks, friars and in particular popes --- and their wealth and influence.
He saw no basis in scripture for the existence of an ecclesiastical elite and instead encouraged a group of itinerant, poor priests to spread the word of God throughout England.
Although he was attacked by the authorities during his lifetime, it wasn't until the Council of Constance in 1415, 31 years after his death, that he was formally declared a heretic.
Among his greater heresies were his rejection of the doctrine of transubstantiation (on the grounds that it elevated priests to daily miracle-workers and had no biblical basis) and his denunciation of certain popes as antichrists.
The church decreed that his books be burned and his remains exhumed.
3 Fortunately, many of Wycliffe's books survived and it is one of these that is the main reason why Wycliffe is remembered today.
Wycliffe was part of an important fourteenth-century movement to bring the English language to the institutions of church, court and government.
Although parts of the Bible already existed in English, Wycliffe was the first to oversee a full translation.
And while scholars today question how much of the translation work was undertaken by Wycliffe himself, and how much by his disciple Nicholas of Hereford, the work they produced continues to bear his name.
4 While John Wycliffe may not have fared well at the hands of the fourteenth-century authorities, his name and his mission continue today.
Wycliffe Bible Translators (International) is an organisation with fifty-six members and approximately 5,300 workers world-wide.
One such member is Wycliffe Bible Translators Australia ('Wycliffe').
Wycliffe is, and has been since 1 July 2000, endorsed by the Australian Taxation Office as an Income Tax Exempt Charity under sub-division 50-B of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 ('the Act').
It is an evangelical missionary organisation that seeks to spread the Christian religion through literacy and translation work, predominantly in the third world.
It has been particularly active in areas which previously had no written language and has taught people in such places how to read and write their own language.
Its missionaries learn the local language, translate the Bible into that language and then teach the local population how to read the Bible.
5 The respondent, Word Investments Ltd ('Word'), was established by Wycliffe in 1975 to provide financial and fund-raising support to Wycliffe.
The two entities are still linked today, with some sharing of staff and common registered offices.
Like John Wycliffe, Word has come into conflict with the authorities.
The applicant, the Commissioner of Taxation, does not accept that Word is a charity and has refused to endorse it as exempt from paying income tax.
6 The relevant provisions of Division 50 of the Act, as they apply to Word, require Word, in order to be exempt, to be a charitable institution which has a physical presence in Australia and to incur its expenditure and pursue its objectives principally in Australia.
They also require it to be endorsed as exempt from income tax.
In 2001, Word applied for income tax exemption and the Commissioner refused to endorse it.
A further application, which was also refused, was made in 2002.
7 Word then appealed to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal ('the Tribunal') which found that Word was entitled to endorsement from 1 July 2002, but was not entitled to endorsement prior to that date since its primary activity at that time was the running of a commercial funeral business that was not charitable in nature.
8 The Commissioner has appealed the finding of the Tribunal that Word was entitled to be endorsed as a tax exempt charitable entity under the Act for the period from 1 July 2002.
There is also a cross-appeal by Word against the finding of the Tribunal that Word was not a tax exempt charitable entity between 1 July 2000 (when the endorsement regime commenced) and 1 July 2002.
The activities of Word 
 
 9 Word's memorandum of association includes, in clause 3, a very comprehensive list of objects.
The list begins by setting out a number of evangelical objects:
 
 
 
 "(a) (i) To proclaim preach teach enunciate expound and to propagate evangelise continue carry forward expand and increase the Christian Religion both in Victoria and throughout the rest of the world by all means whether oral printed visual audible mechanical or otherwise.

 
 (ii) To provide train maintain and send forth teachers preachers and lecturers who subscribe to the basis of belief of the members of the Company ... 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (iii) To co-operate with encourage and provide assistance both financial and otherwise for Evangelical Missionary Organisations and Evangelical Missionaries operating or to become operative in Victoria or elsewhere throughout the world.

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (iv) To hold rallies and other meetings in Victoria and when occasion arises throughout the rest of the world.

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (v) To generally co-operate with Evangelical Churches but not so as to become or resemble a denomination.

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (vi) To encourage the enlistment of missionary volunteers and to guide these into other Evangelical Missionary Organisations and/or send them to other countries of the world.

 
 
 
 

10 Further objects in the list set out the financial activities of Word:
 
 
 
 "(b) To carry on any business or activity which may seem to the Company capable of being conveniently carried on in connection with the objects for which this Company is established.

 ... 
 (k) To subscribe and make payments to any fund for religious charitable or benevolent objects of any description.

 
 
 
 ... 
 
 
 
 (q) To invest and deal with the moneys of the Company in such manner as may from time to time be determined by the Board of Directors.

 
 
 
 ... 
 
 
 
 (t) To take money on deposit at interest or otherwise.

 
 
 
 ... 
 
 
 
 (u) To set aside out of the profits of this Company such sums as the Board of Directors thinks proper as reserved, for maintaining the whole or any part of the Company's property or for meeting contingencies and for any other purposes connected with the business of the Company or any part thereof and the Board of Directors may invest the sums so set aside in the business of this Company or in such securities as the Board of Directors selects.
" 
 
 

11 There are other relevant provisions of Word's memorandum of association as follows: 
 
 (a) Word is prohibited from distributing profits or gains to its members (clause 4);
 
 
 (b) Word's membership is limited to committed Christians who have acknowledged the Christian faith and a belief in the Bible as the infallible word of God (clause 8).

 

12 The nature of Word's activities has changed somewhat over time.
Word was initially involved in raising funds through housing development.
This activity ceased in the early 1980s after which there were two or three years of dormancy.
In 1986 or 1987 Word's directors approached Wycliffe to seek its views on whether Word should continue.
The result was a decision that Word would take over the fund-raising activities then carried on by Wycliffe, which consisted of investing money borrowed at non-commercial rates from people who wished to support its activities.
13 At this time, Word held itself out as offering financial planning advice and investment opportunities.
Its information memorandum for investors described Word as existing "for the purpose of offering the public financial planning advice and a sound investment vehicle where interest earned is used to further the work of Bible translation and other Christian work throughout the world.
" Its investments were to be in "areas that, in the opinion of the administration, are morally and culturally ethical and offer sound investment opportunities.
" Investment vehicles included government and semi-government securities, banks and other investments.
Investors were entitled to up to 25% of the interest earned on their investments, with the remainder to be distributed by Word.
In reality, most investors chose not to be paid any interest.
14 Word's investors were members of the Christian public who lent money at low rates of interest.
Until 2002 this interest was the only major source of income for Word.
The majority of it was distributed to Wycliffe, with the balance going to other Christian organisations.
What Wycliffe did with the money given to it by Word was well known to Word and to its investors, but was not the subject of any control by Word.
Word did not itself organise translations, send missionaries overseas, train pastors, publish scriptures or engage generally in evangelising work.
All of these things were done by Wycliffe, whose activities I have described briefly above at [4].
There is no suggestion that Wycliffe's activities are not charitable, nor is there any doubt that they are conducted almost exclusively outside of Australia.
15 The first significant change in Word's fund-raising activities came in 1996 when moneys in a term deposit stood to be reinvested.
It was resolved to establish Bethel Funerals, a funeral business.
The purpose statement and philosophy statement of Bethel Funerals referred to the Christian purposes of the business and to the fact that profits were to be distributed to two main ministry organisations, one of which was Wycliffe.
Word's principal activities after the establishment of Bethel Funerals are set out in its Directors' Report for the year ending 30 June 1999:
 
 "The principal activities of the company during the financial year were to generate working capital for church and missionary organisations proclaiming the Word of God through either oral, printed, visual or audible means.

 
 Bethel Funerals continued to trade well being a considerable contributor to this years operating surplus.
" 

 16 From 1 July 2002 Word's directors resolved to create a trust, Word Investments Foundation Trust ('the Foundation'), to hold Bethel Funerals.
Word acts as trustee of the Foundation and conducts Bethel Funerals in that capacity.
Consequently, from that time, Word's only source of income has been the investment of moneys lent to it by investors.
At around the same time, Word paid Wycliffe to carry out a particular translation, rather than giving the equivalent amount directly to Wycliffe.
Word's directors said that this was to enable Word to be more closely involved with Wycliffe's activities.
17 In March 2005 the Foundation applied for endorsement as a tax exempt charitable fund.
The application was refused and an objection was made against that refusal in May 2005.
As at the date of the Tribunal hearing, no decision had been made on the objection.
18 In 2005, apparently because of uncertainty about its status for income tax purposes, the directors of Word resolved to terminate its investment activities.
The relevant legislation 
 
19 Division 50 of Part 2-15 of the Act concerns various entities that are exempt from the payment of income tax.
Section 50-1 provides as follows:
 
 "The total ordinary income and statutory income of the entities covered by the following tables is exempt from income tax.
In some cases, the exemption is subject to special conditions.
" 

20 The relevant table is contained in s 50-5 and provides as follows:

21 The special conditions are set out in ss 50-50 to 50-60:
 
 "50-50 An entity covered by item 1.1 or 1.2 is not exempt from income tax unless the entity:

" 
 

22 Section 50-105 obliges the Commissioner to endorse an entity as exempt from income tax if the entity is both entitled to be so endorsed and has applied for endorsement.
Section 50-110 provides the circumstances that must exist for an entity to be entitled to endorsement.
Relevantly, under sub-s (2), the entity must be covered by one of the specified items in the table in section 50-5 and, under sub-s (5)(a), the entity must meet the applicable special conditions.
