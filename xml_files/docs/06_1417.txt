 
1 The appellant appeals from the judgment of Federal Magistrate Smith in which his application for judicial review of a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal was rejected.
The Tribunal had affirmed a decision of a delegate of the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs to refuse the appellant a protection visa.
2 The appellant is a citizen of the Republic of China, also known as Taiwan.
He claimed to fear persecution if returned to Taiwan in the reasonably foreseeable future by reason of his religion and his membership of a particular social group.
He said that his business activities often took him to the People's Republic of China.
On one occasion he claimed that he was arrested there and allowed to return to Taiwan on the condition that he collected information for the Chinese secret service on Falun Gong practices.
He said that the information he provided resulted in about ten Falun Gong leaders from Taiwan being refused entry to China.
He also said that he tried to stop his spying activities but Chinese authorities threatened the quality of life of his sister who resides in mainland China.
3 The appellant's statement in support of his application for refugee status did not clearly articulate which religion he observed, apart from saying that he liked Falun Gong.
He also did not specify the alleged social group he belonged to or what would happen to him if he returned to Taiwan.
4 The Tribunal invited the appellant to a hearing so that he could give oral evidence in support of his application.
The appellant failed to attend the hearing.
The Tribunal then determined the matter pursuant to s 426A(1) of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) without taking any further action to enable the appellant to appear before it.
5 The Tribunal found the appellant's claims to be lacking in detail.
It said that it was unable to make any findings regarding his claims and could not be satisfied that he had a well-founded fear of persecution for a Convention reason.
