2 On 27 February 2006 the appellant filed a notice of appeal from a decision of Jarrett FM of 6 February 2006, wherein the learned Federal Magistrate had dismissed the appellant's application and ordered the appellant to pay the costs of and incidental to that application.
The application was for a review of a decision made by the Migration Review Tribunal affirming a decision not to grant the appellant a student (temporary) (class TU) higher education sector visa.
