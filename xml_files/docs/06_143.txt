 
1 Mr Shane (Tony) Fowle was an employee of the Commonwealth working within the Australian Protective Service (APS).
From about February 1996 he was on either sick leave or compensation leave from that employment.
On 23 May 1996 the second defendant Comcare accepted liability on his claim for compensation for generalised anxiety disorder under the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988 (Cth) (the SRC Act).
2 APS arranged with the Hydro Electric Commission (the Hydro), the predecessor of the plaintiff Aurora Energy Pty Ltd (Aurora), that, for the purposes of his rehabilitation, Mr Fowle should carry out some duties for the Hydro.
3 Mr Fowle worked under this arrangement for three successive periods.
At all times Comcare paid him weekly compensation and other payments to which he was entitled under the SRC Act.
