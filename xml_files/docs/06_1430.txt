 INTRODUCTION 
 
1 In this action, the Applicant ('Vero') a mortgage insurer contends that acting in reliance upon a 'residential valuation and security assessment' dated 5 May 1999 undertaken by the Second Respondent valuer ('David Duffield') of a property situated at 30 Latreille Terrace, Brinsmead, Cairns, offered as security by a mortgagor for a loan, Vero issued a policy of lenders mortgage insurance to the mortgagee, Perpetual Trustees Victoria Limited ('Perpetual') in circumstances where the valuation and assessment had been completed and signed by David Duffield (as agent for the First Respondent ('Taylor Byrne')) in breach of a duty of care owed by the First and Second Respondents to the Applicant and in circumstances where particular conduct in connection with the preparation of the valuation involved a contravention of ss 52 , and 53A of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) ('the Act').
2 The Applicant contends that had each of the First and Second Respondents discharged a duty owed to the Applicant to exercise all reasonable care, skill and diligence as a competent valuer in preparing the valuation and security assessment; to describe the unusual features of the property including the unusual design of improvements to the property; to assign an appropriate risk rating to the property; to describe the unusual configuration of improvements to the property; and to record any deficiencies in the property detrimentally affecting the marketability of the property, Vero would not have issued the policy of insurance.
3 The Applicant also contends that the failure to adequately describe the unusual design of the property including its improvements, the assigning of a 'low' risk rating in respect of those improvements and the failure to state in the valuation that in order to achieve a sale of the property at or about the valuation a marketing period of up to 12 to 18 months was likely to be necessary, is the expression of conduct which was misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive Vero and constituted false or misleading representations concerning the nature of an interest in land and the characteristics of that land thus giving rise to contraventions of ss 52 and 53A of the Act.
Although the Applicant contends that the Respondents owed a duty 'to describe any unusual features of the Property including the unusual design of improvements' and a duty to 'describe any unusual configuration of the Property's improvements', the Applicant contends in submissions that the duty was not one to describe the particular features of the improvements as 'unusual' but a duty to describe or identify the design feature thus placing the Applicant in a position to decide for itself whether those features or design characteristics were 'unusual'.
4 In addition, the Applicant contends that the Respondents did not have reasonable grounds for making the valuation and security assessment.
5 The Applicant further contends that in relying upon the valuation provided to it, the Applicant suffered loss and damage by ultimately paying Perpetual an amount of $96,733.17 on or about 13 September 2002 pursuant to the policy representing the loss suffered by the mortgagee arising out of the mortgagee's exercise of a power of sale of the subject property upon default by the mortgagor and suffered further loss and damage consisting of legal expenses incurred by the Applicant in seeking to recover that sum from the mortgagor pursuant to an assignment to Vero of the rights and interests of the mortgagee.
The amount of those costs is $35,954.93 representing a total claim of $132,688.10.
6 The Applicant claims that sum from the First Respondent as damages for negligence or alternatively as compensation 'in whole ... for the loss or damage' pursuant to s 87 of the Act.
The Applicant claims that sum from the Second Respondent as damages for negligence.
In final submissions, the Applicant sought leave to amend the Application and the relief sought by the Further Amended Statement of Claim to include a claim for damages pursuant to s 82 of the Act ([25] of the Applicant's closing submissions filed 4 January 2006).
The application for leave is resisted by the Respondents.
7 The Applicant contends that the valuation and security assessment document must be read in conjunction with the Australian Property Institute (API) Residential Valuation and Security Assessment Pro-forma Supporting Memorandum ('Supporting Memorandum') dated 8 May 1998 which guides the valuer in the completion of the two page pro-forma residential valuation and security assessment document.
The content of the duty of care on the part of the valuer and the expression of a breach of that duty is, in part, informed by the Supporting Memorandum.
8 Put simply, the Applicant says that David Duffield ought to have disclosed in the valuation and security assessment document that the building on the site incorporated a design which limited access to four of the five bedrooms by means of an open-air verandah and that each of those four bedrooms involved use of a shared separate bathroom with an adjoining bedroom.
Such a design is said to be 'unusual' in that comparatively few houses exhibit such a design and the proper discharge of the duties owed to the Applicant necessarily required disclosure of these two design features.
9 Secondly, the Applicant says that David Duffield ought to have disclosed in the pro-forma valuation report the circumstance that by reason of the unusual design features incorporated within the subject luxury house, it would necessarily take a lengthy period of time to secure a sale of the property within the limited field of buyers who might be interested in such a property and, more particularly, David Duffield ought to have disclosed that a marketing period of up to 12 to 18 months was likely to be necessary to secure a sale at the valuation price.
Although I have described the Applicant's contention in this contextual way, the formulation of the breach of duty is not just that the property might require a longer marketing period than the orthodoxy of the Supporting Memorandum suggested but that 'a marketing period of up to 12 to 18 months was likely to be necessary'.
10 The contention is that had all these matters been disclosed, the Applicant would not have engaged in the transaction by issuing the policy and thus no risk would have been assumed at Vero at all.
11 The Respondents admit that they owed the Applicant a duty of care to exercise all reasonable care, skill and diligence as a competent valuer in preparing the valuation and security assessment.
The Respondents also admit a duty of care owed to the Applicant to record in the valuation any deficiencies in the property that may detrimentally affect the property's marketability.
The Respondents do not admit a duty to describe any unusual features of the property including the contended unusual design of the property's improvements.
They say that these features are simply matters of professional opinion about which views might legitimately differ.
Further, the Respondents say the Supporting Memorandum does not require disclosure of 'unusual' features and the assigning of a risk rating as part of the pro forma valuation report in large part depended upon the proper application and construction of the Supporting Memorandum.
The Respondents also say that it is important to recognise that the improvements to the property were being valued by David Duffield consistent with its use by the mortgagor as a single residential dwelling.
12 The Respondents also contend that the insurer did not, upon proper analysis, rely upon the valuation because its officers elected to provide mortgage insurance to Perpetual prior to the receipt of the valuation report; that David Duffield undertook an inspection of the property and prepared a valuation report in a particular capacity on behalf of the First Respondent and in doing so did not assume a personal liability to the Applicant but rather acted at all relevant times in such a way as to give rise to a liability, if at all, in the First Respondent; and that the information disclosed in David Duffield's pro forma valuation report, assessed in conjunction with the Supporting Memorandum, conveyed sufficient information to the Applicant's officers that they ought to have either appreciated the character of the improvements or, alternatively, made further enquiry of David Duffield as to the improvements.
Moreover, the failure to make such enquiry involves conduct on the part of the Applicant which has contributed to the loss now sought to be recovered from the Respondents and thus any award of damages or order for compensation ought to be reduced to the extent of the Applicant's contribution to its loss.
13 As to the conduct in contravention of s 52, the Respondents say that the content of or omissions in the valuation are simply matters going to an expression of professional opinion about which views might legitimately differ and a difference of opinion is not the expression of a breach of a duty of care.
Nor can an expression of opinion, in such circumstances, it is said, constitute a misrepresentation.
As to s 53A, the Respondents say that the representations, apart from any other matter, do not exhibit any relevant connection with 'an interest in land' or 'the characteristics of the land', in question.
14 At the commencement of the trial the Applicant elected to abandon a number of components of its case formulated in the Amended Statement of Claim.
In the Amended Statement of Claim, the Applicant contended that the Respondents owed the Applicant a duty to ascertain the market value of the property, make sufficient and appropriate enquiries and investigations as to the value of comparable properties and to properly describe the use of the property.
As to the question of breach, the Applicant had contended that the Respondents: failed to exercise due care, skill and diligence in assessing the market value of the property; ascertained a value that was not the market value; made insufficient or inappropriate enquiries as to value; and failed to record in the valuation that the marketability of the property was adversely affected by, first, there being no room to install a swimming pool and secondly, by the use of compressed fibrous cement in the construction of the house.
The amendments abandoning these contentions are the subject of the Further Amended Statement of Claim filed on 8 December 2005.
15 The contentions, formally, now are these:

16 Corresponding amendments were made to those paragraphs of the Further Amended Statement of Claim pleading material facts in relation to contraventions of ss 52 and 53A.
17 Written objections to particular paragraphs of affidavits were exchanged between the parties.
During the course of the trial, objections to evidence were dealt with as each witness was called and each affidavit tendered.
THE BACKGROUND FACTS 
 
18 I find the facts to be these.
19 On 19 April 1999, Cornitus Cats and Bethwyn Cats (the "borrower") completed an application form addressed to Residential Housing Corporation Pty Ltd trading as Resi Home Loans ('Resi') for a loan to re-finance an existing house loan and for additional funds for investment, in a total amount of $400,000.00.
The application document was lodged with Resi on 21 April 1999 and recites in the Assets and Liabilities Statement the residential property at 30 Latreille Terrace as one of the assets of the borrower at a value of $520,000.00.
In another section of the same document, the 'estimated value' of the property is described as '$470,000.00+'.
The Resi application document recites that the borrower has made an application for finance to Perpetual Trustees Victoria Limited and Permanent Custodians Limited ('Permanent') to be arranged by Resi.
20 On 22 April 1999, Resi submitted a proposal for lenders residential mortgage insurance ('L M insurance') to Royal  Sun Alliance Lenders Mortgage Insurance Limited ('Royal  Sun Alliance') now known as Vero Lenders Mortgage Insurance Limited, the Applicant.
In these reasons, I will generally describe Royal  Sun Alliance as Vero.
In the insurance proposal, the lender is described as Perpetual and the mortgage manager of the proposed loan on behalf of Perpetual is described as Interstar Securities Pty Ltd ('Interstar').
The proposal identifies a loan amount of $356,250.00 and recites that the 'loan application form, valuation/security assessment, all associated and supporting documents and details of further securities must be submitted with, and form part of, this proposal'.
Plainly enough, the proposal document contemplates that a range of material and information will be assessed by the insurer in making a decision as to whether to accept the proposal and assume the risk.
21 From February 1998 to June 2000, Tome Zrilic was employed by Vero as an underwriter.
Prior to 1998, Tome Zrilic had worked as a residential lending officer for a period of between two and four years at variously, Advance Bank, Commonwealth Bank and Aussie Home Loans and was responsible for approving residential housing loans.
That role also involved the assessment of property valuations to ensure that the proposed security was acceptable from a lender's perspective and thus Tome Zrilic was familiar with the assessment of valuation reports.
In 1999, Tome Zrilic was responsible for reviewing lenders mortgage insurance proposals put to Vero by or on behalf of Interstar.
Often, such applications were submitted to Vero by a loan originator or loan arranger such as Resi.
In the case of proposals made on behalf of Interstar, applications would often be submitted to Vero by Resi as the loan originator in circumstances where Interstar was acting as the manager of the loan application for Perpetual as the proposed lender and mortgagee.
22 In assessing a proposal for L M insurance, Tome Zrilic had regard to and was familiar with an important document prepared by the insurer described as the '1998 Lender's Mortgage Insurance Residential Credit Policy Manual for Prime Loans' ('the Policy Manual').
The Policy Manual 
 
23 At the material time, the policy manual was just that.
It contained the set of policies and key principles adopted by Vero against which judgments had to be made as to whether the proposal for L M insurance was acceptable.
For example, the Policy Manual says the L M insurance policy was designed to provide indemnity to financial institutions such as Perpetual rather than individuals and no L M insurance policy would issue unsupported by acceptable real estate security in favour of the mortgagee.
24 The manual by section 1 (7 pages) sets out 17 partly qualified (in some cases) categories of acceptable sources of income available to a borrower to service the mortgage commitment and 15 categories of unacceptable sources of income.
The manual also established ratios of the proportion of income that could be derived from particular categories of acceptable income presumably in order to ensure no over-dependence by the borrower on any one or two sources of income.
25 Section 2 A sets out a list of acceptable and unacceptable assets as the source of a borrower's minimum deposit obligation.
26 Section 2 B identifies a list of the categories of acceptable and unacceptable potential borrowers from the insured financial institution.
For example, Australian residents, companies incorporated in Australia and Trustees are some of the acceptable borrowers; 'clubs, churches and Congregations' are not.
Section 2 D sets out employment standards that must be achieved by the proposed borrower such as a minimum period of full time employment, permanent or part-time employment and other such matters.
Section 2 E deals with the requirements relating to guarantors.
Sections 3 A and 3 B deal with the categories of adverse credit risk and the range of credit checks to be undertaken concerning the proposed borrower from the financial institution.
27 Section 3 C sets out a matrix of the ten acceptable purposes for a loan the subject of the proposed L M insurance, the acceptable term of an interest only loan, the term of fully amortising loans and the percentage threshold of exposure the insurer is prepared to accept for each class of loan based upon a loan to value ratio described as an 'LVR'.
For example, an 'owner occupied housing loan --- Refinance only' is acceptable on an interest only basis for five years at 90% of LVR.
Alternatively, a fully amortising loan at 95% of LVR may be taken over a 30 year period.
Section 3 D sets out 14 unacceptable loan purposes.
28 Section 3 E1 sets out a schedule of 'acceptable single/individual residential security' that might be the subject of L M insurance and a schedule of unacceptable residential security.
Acceptable security is identified as:
 
 'Houses 
 Units 
 Flats 
 Villas 
 Duplexes 
 Townhouses 
 Vacant residential lands, standard allotment size 
 Rural residential up to 8 ha (hectares) 
 Apartments' 
 

29 The schedule of unacceptable residential security recites 46 items.
Included within those items are these:
 
 'Unusually designed houses 
 Bedsitters 
 Studios/or studio type 
 Luxury/penthouse apartments 
 Luxury houses 
 Motels/Hotels 
 Resorts 
 Hostels 
 Boarding house 
 Over capitalised houses' 
 

30 Section 3 E2 sets out a schedule of factors affecting the proposed security that would require particular consideration in the context of the full merits of any application.
Such factors include the affect of electricity pylons, noise affected property, country locations and prestige suburban areas.
Section 3 F sets out the classes of acceptable and unacceptable land title offered as mortgage security in favour of the lender, the subject of the L M insurance proposal.
