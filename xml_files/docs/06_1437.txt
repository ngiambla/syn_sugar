 
1 At issue in this notice of motion to amend the application and statement of claim is the capacity in which the second applicant brings the proceedings.
The current statement of claim, the further amended statement of claim filed on 2 December 2005, alleges that Errol Investments Pty Ltd acts and acted on its own behalf.
2 The amendments sought to be made by the applicants may be separated into two categories.
In the notice of motion, which was filed on 11 September 2006, the applicants sought a declaration as to the effect of actions taken before and after the second set of amendments.
That order is not pressed.
THE FIRST SET OF AMENDMENTS 
 
3 The evidence in support of this motion is that Errol Investments agreed to purchase certain land ('the Rothbury land') from Hunter Valley Estates Pty Ltd by agreement made on 4 December 1999 ('the Rothbury contract').
The applicants allege contraventions of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) ('the Act') by the respondents in connection with that transaction.
