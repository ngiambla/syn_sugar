 
1 The notice of motion before the Court concerns an application by the Tax Agents' Board of Queensland ('the Board') for orders that an appeal of Mr Aalders commenced by notice of appeal filed on 26 August 2005 be dismissed.
The claim is brought pursuant to the discretionary power of the Court in s 23 Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) or alternatively O 20 r 2 Federal Court Rules to dismiss or permanently stay an appeal on the grounds that to proceed would be futile or would involve the Court in the determination of issues that are moot or hypothetical.
That these provisions confer this power on the Court in such circumstances is clear from the decision of the Full Court in Beitseen v Johnson (1989) 29 IR 336 at 338.
BACKGROUND 
 
2 Mr Aalders, a chartered accountant who was a registered tax agent in New Zealand, applied to the Board for registration as a tax agent in Queensland on 2 August 2002.
The application was on two grounds: first, under the Trans-Tasman Mutual Recognition Act 1997 (Cth) ('the TTMR Act'), and second, under the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (Cth) ('Tax Act').
3 The Board refused Mr Aalders' application for registration under both Acts, and he applied to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal ('the Tribunal') for review of that decision.
4 The Tribunal delivered its decision on 29 July 2005.
