 Two Union Delegates are Retrenched 
 
1 Until 27 September 2006 Mr Tony Seymour and Mr Jeff Gearin (the applicants) were employed by Saint-Gobain Abrasives Pty Ltd (the respondent).
On that day they were each compulsorily retrenched.
They were the delegates, at the respondent's site at Lidcombe, of the National Union of Workers' ('the NUW').
They were the only union delegates at the site.
2 Mr Seymour had been employed by the respondent for 30 years.
He became a site delegate in the mid 1980s.
Mr Gearin had been employed by the respondent for 18 years.
He became a site delegate in 1988 at about the time, or shortly after, he commenced employment.
3 It was common ground that, as union delegates, the applicants had, over the years, been involved in negotiations with the management of the respondent.
Moreover, in recent years, they had been involved in the organisation of industrial action.
Some of the negotiations in earlier years, and more recently since March 2006, had been hard fought, even heated.
4 Both the applicants and the respondent drew attention in their evidence to the prior history, although for different reasons.
The applicants wished to suggest that they had become a thorn in the side of management and that things came to a head during 2006.
The respondent relied upon the prior history to displace the suggestion that it was predisposed against the applicants by reason of their role as union delegates, being accustomed to deal with them in that capacity.
5 The evidence about these matters is consistent with either view and ultimately does not provide much assistance in the resolution of the present matter.
6 Mr Wayne Meaney is Assistant State Secretary of the NSW Branch of the NUW and is the NUW official responsible for the respondent's site at Lidcombe.
His evidence was that the NUW had, at September 2006, 40 members out of about 50 workers employed at the site.
7 Terms and conditions of employment at the site are regulated by the 'Saint-Gobain Ltd Certified Agreement 2004 for Lidcombe and Wetherall Park, Production and Warehouse Employees' ('Certified Agreement').
This Agreement was certified on 27 July 2004 under the Workplace Relations Act 1996 (Cth) ('the WR Act') and remained in force until 29 June 2006 and thereafter in accordance with the provisions of that Act.
8 Mr Meaney said that a handful of employees are covered by Australian Workplace Agreements ('AWAs').
AWAs are also registered under the WR Act.
9 Negotiations for a new Certified Agreement commenced in March 2006.
Over the following five months, until 8 August 2006, representatives of the NUW (including the applicants and Mr Meaney) met with Ms Catherine Hobbs, the Human Resources Manager --- Pacific, for the respondent.
The parties are agreed that there were eight or nine such meetings.
Negotiations broke down at a meeting on 8 August 2006.
10 Meanwhile, on 26 July 2006 the NUW initiated a 'bargaining period' under s 423 of the WR Act.
The significance of this step is that it put in train a process whereby, in due course and subject to meeting certain statutory requirements, industrial action might be taken which was 'protected' under the WR Act.
11 One statutory requirement to be satisfied arose under Part 9, Division 4 of the WR Act --- namely the need to obtain an order from the Australian Industrial Relations Commission ('AIRC') for a secret ballot to be held to authorise industrial action.
To that end the NUW applied, on 1 September 2006, to the AIRC for such a ballot.
The application was opposed.
It was heard by Senior Deputy President Marsh on 4, 11 and 26 September 2006.
As at 27 September 2006 (the date of the applicants' dismissals) her Honour was reserved on the question whether a ballot should be held.
12 During the course of the negotiations Ms Hobbs was asked whether the respondent was considering redundancies.
She said it was not.
Ms Hobbs thought this conversation occurred in June or July.
Despite the fact that, before the final meeting on 8 August, Ms Hobbs knew that redundancies were, in fact, proposed she did not correct the information she had imparted to the applicants in their role as delegates.
13 The plant manager of the respondent, Mr Slavko Grbic, said he began to give active consideration to a reduction of the workforce in July.
There is some evidence from the respondent that the exercise was prompted by statements by the applicants in the negotiations of an under-utilisation of workers in the 'Maker Division', the area in which they both worked.
Whether the review was prompted by any such remark is unclear but the review which was carried out by Mr Grbic was not confined, as will be seen, to that area of operations.
14 A report was sent to the respondent's senior management in Paris seeking approval to incur the cost of redundancy payments arising from the retrenchment of ten employees, suggesting that the cost would be recovered in about a year-and-a-half and there would be on-going savings.
It will be necessary to discuss the contents of this report in greater detail.
15 Approval to the position redundancies and consequent retrenchments was given on about Friday, 15 September.
The workforce was informed on Monday, 18 September.
Volunteers were sought.
Employees were told they would need to apply in writing by 22 September.
16 At about the same time that the impending redundancies were announced the respondent sent a letter to members of the workforce, including the applicants, offering employment pursuant to an AWA.
Ms Hobbs' evidence was that AWAs had been available since July but only to employees who had sought them.
The letters, which were sent on 19 September 2006, were, she said, the first occasion on which offers of AWAs were made to employees.
Neither of the applicants accepted the offer.
17 On 27 September 2006 a meeting was held between Ms Hobbs and Mr Grbic and, sequentially, the supervisor in each of the three areas in which redundancies and retrenchments were to occur.
According to the respondent's evidence selections were made at that meeting of persons to be retrenched according to the possession or non-possession of particular skills in various parts of the operations and on various pieces of equipment.
18 In the selection process a number of volunteers were rejected and some who had not volunteered, including the applicants, were selected to be retrenched.
Shortly after the meeting each of the applicants was informed that he was to be retrenched.
19 Mr Meaney gave uncontradicted evidence that each of the persons selected for retrenchment was a union member.
To put the matter another way, none of the ten or so non-members were retrenched.
20 The applicants each received severance pay at the rate of four weeks pay for each year of service to a maximum of 72 weeks, a payment for notice of four or five weeks depending on age (5 weeks if older than 45) and a payment for unused sick leave.
Mr Seymour was paid $98,186.75 and Mr Gearin $82,568.56.
21 At this time neither the NUW nor the applicants had seen the material which emerged during the proceedings by way of explanation of the respondent's actions, including Mr Grbic's report referred to earlier.
22 The retrenchment of the applicants, and others, occurred in circumstances where the NUW and the applicants were embarked upon a course designed to authorise industrial action at the respondent's Lidcombe operations.
There had been no consultation about redundancies.
The two union delegates at the site who had been had been intimately involved in the negotiations were removed from the scene.
The respondent, at the same time, seemed to be embarking on a program of altering the nature of style or industrial negotiations from a collective to an individual basis.
23 These circumstances provided the foundation for the proceedings, as commenced.
Nature of Proceedings 
 
24 The proceedings were commenced two days after the applicants were retrenched, on 29 September 2006.
The Application alleges contravention of s 792 of the WR Act in that the respondent dismissed the applicants from their employment because they were delegates or members of an industrial organisation.
25 The applicants seek relief under s 807 of the WR Act.
They seek, by way of final relief, reinstatement in their employment and payment of wages lost due to their dismissal.
In addition but, as became clear, in the alternative, compensation is sought.
Further orders are sought restraining the respondent from further contravention of s 792 and the imposition of a penalty for the contravention alleged to have occurred.
26 Pending final hearing an interim order of reinstatement was sought.
However, on 4 October 2006 Gyles J ordered that the matter be listed instead for urgent final hearing.
The hearing before me commenced on 19 October and continued on 20, 27 and 30 October 2006, with some extended sitting hours being used to complete the hearing.
27 Section 809 of the WR Act erects a statutory presumption which is of considerable importance to the applicants' case.
It provides:
 
 '(1) If: 
 
 
 
 (a) in an application under section 807 relating to a person's conduct, it is alleged that the conduct was, or is being, carried out for a particular reason or with a particular intent; and 
 (b) for the person to carry out the conduct for that reason or with that intent would constitute a contravention of this Part; 
 
 
 
 
 it is presumed, in proceedings under this Division arising from the application, that the conduct was, or is being, carried out for that reason or with that intent, unless the person proves otherwise.

 
 
 
 (2) This section does not apply in relation to the granting of an interim injunction.
' 
 
 

28 The effect of this provision is that the respondent bears the onus, on the balance of probabilities, of excluding a conclusion that the applicants were dismissed because they were delegates or members of the NUW.
As will be seen the effect of this provision is central to my reasoning in the present matter.
29 Because the respondent must exclude delegateship and membership as a reason for termination, normally sworn evidence denying any such reason is necessary and, in most cases, an explanation of the real reason for dismissal consistent with the absence of delegateship or membership as a reason is, in a practical sense, also necessary.
An instructive example of the interaction between the two categories of evidence and the consequence of partial acceptance only of the explanations proffered may be seen in Maritime Union of Australia  Ors v Geraldton Port Authority  Ors [1999] FCA 899 ; (1999) 93 FCR 34 esp at [313], [325], [332], [338], [339], [345], [350] and [351].
30 Where more than one person contributes to a decision to dismiss it may be necessary to lead appropriate evidence from each such person.
In the present case, for reasons which appear later, it was necessary for Ms Hobbs and Mr Grbic, in particular, to persuade me that neither delegateship nor membership was a reason for the dismissal of the applicants.
31 The respondents did not contend that the applicants had failed to make out any element of their own case.
Properly, in the circumstances, the respondent accepted that the onus fell to it to displace the legislative presumption arising from s 809 of the WR Act.
The case therefore centred on this issue.
The Respondent's Case 
 
32 The respondent's case was based on two foundations: first, an explicit denial from relevant decision makers that the retrenchment of either of the applicants was for the reason that he was a delegate or member of an industrial organisation; and, secondly, an explanation of the 'real reason' for dismissal.
