 
1 Before me are two Notices of Objection to Competency to an Application for an Order of Review filed by the applicant on 24 August 2006.
The first notice is an amended Notice of Objection to Competency filed by the first respondent on 24 October 2006, which amends the notice filed by the first respondent on 27 September 2006.
The second Notice of Objection to Competency was filed by the third respondent on 6 October 2006.
For convenience, I shall continue to refer to Mr Keelty, Ms Boast and the Department as 'respondents' notwithstanding that two of these parties are applicants to the notices; similarly it is convenient to refer to Mr Gant as 'the applicant' notwithstanding that he is the respondent to these notices.
2 Order 54 r 4 Federal Court Rules provides that a notice of objection to competency of an Application for an Order of Review must be filed within 14 days after service of the application.
Both the notice of objection filed by the first respondent on 27 September 2006, and the notice of objection filed by the third respondent on 6 October 2006 were filed out of time.
Mr Porter for the first respondent and Mr McLeod for the third respondent sought leave to rely on their respective notices of objection to competency.
Leave was not opposed by Mr Asuzu for the applicant and I granted leave.
3 Mr Porter also sought leave in respect of the amended notice of objection to competency filed 24 October 2006.
Again leave was not opposed by Mr Asuzu and I granted leave.
BACKGROUND 
 Background facts 
 
4 The background to this application is that Mr Michael Molyneux, an officer of the Australian Federal Police, sought a search warrant on 17 September 2004 in respect of certain items.
The search warrant was issued on 17 September 2004 by the second respondent in respect of items relating to a mobile phone, and/or certain SIM cards of the applicant, which items related to the applicant.
On its face, the warrant stated that it related to items:
 
 'as to which there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that they will afford evidence as to the commission of the following offence against the laws of the Commonwealth: 
 
 
 That on 12 September 2004 in the state of New South Wales, Charles Edward GANT intentionally used a carriage service supplied by Telstra to contact Media Monitors Canberra with the result that another person was menaced or harassed contrary to section 85ZE Crimes Act 1914 , Improper Use of Carriage Services.
' 
 

5 The warrant also detailed other offences against s 85ZE Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) (' Crimes Act ') by the applicant between 12 and 15 September 2004, although identifying different recipients of telephone calls.
6 The warrant authorised the search of a unit at the Gold Coast, and two motor vehicles.
It was executed on 22 September 2004.
The applicant was arrested with respect to six offences on that day.
On 23 September 2004 the applicant was brought before the Magistrates Court at Brisbane and bench charge sheets were produced to the Court.
I understand that the summary trial of the charges against the applicant commenced in the Magistrates Court in Brisbane on 10 July 2006.
I also understand that the trial is part-heard, and that it is scheduled for further hearing on 22-24 January 2007.
The Application for an Order of Review 
 
7 The substantive matter to which objections have been filed is an Application for an Order of Review filed by Mr Gant pursuant to O 54 r 2 Federal Court Rules on 24 August 2006.
Order 54 r 2 provides that an Application for an Order of Review under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 (Cth) ('ADJR Act') is to be in the form prescribed in that rule.
The application before me is in that form.
It therefore follows that the applicant seeks an order of review within the scope of the ADJR Act.
