 
1 The appellant appeals from a judgment of Federal Magistrate Riethmuller in which his Honour dismissed applications for judicial review of a decision of the Migration Review Tribunal.
The Tribunal had affirmed a decision of a delegate of the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs to cancel the appellant's Student (Temporary) (Class TU) visa, subclass 573.
FACTUAL BACKGROUND 
 
2 The appellant is a citizen of Bangladesh.
He first arrived in Australia on 7 January 2001 on a Student (Temporary) (Class TU) visa, subclass 560.
3 During his time in Australia the appellant was granted a series of visas which enabled him to study at Central Queensland University, the Hales Institute and the University of Ballarat.
The last of those visas was a subclass 573 visa, which was granted to him on 25 August 2003 and was subject to condition 8202.
Relevantly, that condition required the appellant to achieve "an academic result that is certified by the education provider to be at least satisfactory".
4 On 8 September 2004, the University of Ballarat sent the appellant a "Notice under Section 20 of the Education Services for Overseas Students Act 2000".
This notice stated that the appellant had breached a condition of his student visa relating to satisfactory academic performance.
The particulars of the breach were stated to be:
 
 "Student excluded from the course for a period of two years for poor academic performance.
Student managed to pass in only one out of the 6 units he had enrolled during the last two semesters.
" 
 

5 The notice also stated that the appellant's student visa would automatically be cancelled in 28 days, unless the appellant reported to a compliance officer at the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs before that time.
If the appellant did report to the Department within the specified time, the visa would not be cancelled automatically.
A decision on whether the visa should be cancelled would be made after the appellant reported.
6 On 27 September 2004, the appellant reported to the Department and received a "Notice of Intention to Consider Cancellation".
The notice set out possible grounds for the cancellation of the appellant's visa.
In particular, it stated that the appellant's education provider, the University of Ballarat, had advised the Department that the appellant had failed to achieve a satisfactory academic performance and that he had passed only one of the six units he had enrolled in in the last two semesters.
7 On 25 October 2004, a delegate of the Minister proceeded to cancel the appellant's Student (Temporary) (Class TU), subclass 573, visa pursuant to ss 116(1)(b) and 116 (3) of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) and reg 2.43(2)(b) of the Migration Regulations 1994 (Cth).
8 In the "Record of Decision Whether to Cancel Visa" the delegate summarised the reasons the appellant had given as to why his visa should not be cancelled as follows.
In the first semester the course had been different to what he had expected, and in the second semester he had had personal problems.
His wife had been pregnant and his father was sick in Bangladesh.
9 The appellant was notified of this decision and the reasons for the cancellation.
He sought a review of the decision in the Tribunal.
LEGISLATIVE SCHEME 
 
10 At the time the visa was cancelled, s 116 of the Migration Act relevantly provided: 
 
 
 "(1) Subject to subsections (2) and (3), the Minister may cancel a visa if he or she is satisfied that: 
 
 
 
 ... 
 
 (b) its holder has not complied with a condition of the visa; ... 
 
 
 
 (3) If the Minister may cancel a visa under subsection (1), the Minister must do so if there exist prescribed circumstances in which a visa must be cancelled.
" 
 
 

11 Section 119 of the Migration Act relevantly provided:
 
 
 "(1) Subject to Subdivision F (non-citizens outside Australia), if the Minister is considering cancelling a visa, whether its holder is in or outside Australia, under section 116 , the Minister must notify the holder that there appear to be grounds for cancelling it and: 
 
 
 
 
 
 (a) give particulars of those grounds and of the information (not being non-disclosable information) because of which the grounds appear to exist; and 
 (b) invite the holder to show within a specified time that: 
 
 
 
 (i) those grounds do not exist; or 
 (ii) there is a reason why it should not be cancelled.

12 Regulation 2.43 relevantly provided:

14 Section 20 of the Education Services for Overseas Students Act 2000 (Cth) ("ESOS Act") provides:

 Note 1: The Minister may take action under Division 1 of Part 6 against a registered provider that has breached this section.
A breach of this section is also an offence: see section 104.

 
 Note 2: It is an offence to provide false or misleading information in complying or purporting to comply with this section: see section 108.

 
 
 
 
 
 (2) The registered provider must send the notice as soon as practicable after the breach.

 THE TRIBUNAL'S DECISION 
 
15 In its statement of decision and reasons, the Tribunal referred to the evidence placed before it and found that it showed that the appellant had failed to maintain results which were considered by the University of Ballarat to be satisfactory.
As a consequence, it held that he had breached condition 8202.
16 The Tribunal did accept the appellant's evidence that he had suffered from depression.
It found that this depression had been the result of his father's illness and the termination of his wife's unplanned pregnancy.
However, it found that it did not have a discretion to set aside a visa cancellation once a breach of condition 8202 had been established.
It stated (at [31]-[32]): 
 
 "Once non-compliance with the condition is established the Tribunal is bound, by the operation of s116(3), to affirm the visa cancellation ( Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Hou [2002] FCA 574 and Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Nguyen [2002] FCA 460).
... 
 
 Given the finding of a relevant breach, the combined operation of subsection 116(3) and regulation 2.43 requires that the visa held by the review applicant be cancelled.
The delegate's decision to this effect should be affirmed.
" 
 
 THE FEDERAL MAGISTRATES COURT 
 
17 The appellant sought judicial review of the Tribunal's decision in the Federal Magistrates Court.
