 1 The applicant, Mr Gadd, is in prison.
He is incarcerated at Borallon Correctional Centre, near Ipswich in Queensland.
He is due to be released next Saturday, 18 November 2006.
2 It is not the first time he has been in prison.
He has been in and out of prison since he was 17 years old, about 20 years ago, although on the occasion he was sentenced to his present term of 18 months imprisonment the sentencing judge observed that he had not been convicted of a serious criminal offence since about 1993.
3 Mr Gadd was born in England.
He has lived in Australia for all but two of his 37 years but he is not a citizen of this country.
According to the view taken by the respondent Minister, he is, like Stefan Nystrom whose case was dealt with by the High Court one week ago ( Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v Nystrom [2006] HCA 50) , a person who, by virtue of the provisions of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) ('the Act') holds two visas --- an absorbed person visa which is taken to have been granted to him by virtue of s 34 of the Act and a transition (permanent) visa which he has by operation of Reg 4 of the Migration Reform (Transitional Provisions) Regulations ('the Reform Regulations').
4 This interlocutory judgment concerns an application for urgent interlocutory relief arising from advice to Mr Gadd by letter dated 30 October 2006 that the Minister is considering cancelling his absorbed person visa for character reasons pursuant to s 501 of the Act.
It is common ground before me that Mr Gadd is unable to satisfy the character test under s 501 of the Act.
If his absorbed person visa is cancelled his transitional (permanent) visa will also be cancelled by operation of s 501F of the Act.
5 If his visas are cancelled then, under s 189 of the Act, he must be detained as an unlawful non-citizen.
If he is detained under s 189 he must be kept in immigration detention until he is removed from Australia under s 198 or s 199 or deported under s 200 or granted a visa (s 196(1)(c)).
It seems unlikely he will be granted a visa.
If he is detained under s 189 the detention is to continue unless a court finally determines that the detention is unlawful or that he is not an unlawful non-citizen (s 196(4)).
6 The letter to Mr Gadd required a response by 13 November 2006 but I was informed that no decision would be made before 16 November 2006.
There is some evidence before me that, upon an enquiry being made, an indication was given that the Minister wished to make a decision upon Mr Gadd's visa, taking into account any response he might make, 'before Saturday'.
If his visas are cancelled before Saturday it follows that Mr Gadd will not enjoy any period of liberty but upon release from Borallan Correctional Centre on the expiry of his present term of imprisonment will be immediately detained.
7 The proceedings before the Court have been commenced by Application under s 39B of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth).
The following orders are sought:
 ' Final Orders 
 
 
 
 1.

 3.
A Declaration that the Applicant was not granted a Transitional (Permanent) Visa.

 
 4.

 5.

 Interim Order 
 
 6.
An injunction restraining the Respondent from purporting to cancel (i) the Applicant's purported Absorbed Person Visa, and (ii) cancelling the Applicant's Transitional (Permanent) Visa, pending determination of the application.
' 
 
 
 
 8 The tests I must apply on the present application are well settled.
It is necessary for Mr Gadd to establish first that there is a serious question to be tried with respect to his claim for final relief and that the balance of convenience favours the grant of an interlocutory injunction pending the hearing of his case.
9 The Act establishes the visa system.
Section 29(1) provides: 
 
 
 '(1) Subject to this Act, the Minister may grant a non-citizen permission, to be known as a visa, to do either or both of the following: 
 (a) travel to and enter Australia; 
 (b) remain in Australia.
' 
 
 
 
 10 Section 501(2) provides:
 'The Minister may cancel a visa that has been granted to a person if: 
 

 (a) the Minister reasonably suspects that the person does not pass the character test; and 
 
 (b) the person does not satisfy the Minister that the person passes the character test.
' 
 

 
 11 As explained in Nystrom and earlier cases, legislative changes made in 1992 and 1994 established transitional arrangements for persons (such as Mr Nystrom and, it is common ground, Mr Gadd) who were lawfully in Australia under previous statutory regimes.
Two arrangements, held by the High Court in Nystrom not to be mutually exclusive or contradictory, are those established by s 34 of the Act and Regulation 4 of the Reform Regulations.
12 Section 34 of the Act provides: 
 
 
 '(1) There is a class of permanent visas to remain in, but not re-enter, Australia, to be known as absorbed person visas.

 
 (2) A non-citizen in the migration zone who: 
 
 
 

 (a) on 2 April 1984 was in Australia; and 
 
 (b) before that date, had ceased to be an immigrant; and 
 
 (c) on or after that date, has not left Australia, where left Australia has the meaning it had in this Act before 1 September 1994; and 
 
 (d) immediately before 1 September 1994, was not a person to whom section 20 of this Act as in force then applied; 
 
 is taken to have been granted an absorbed person visa on 1 September 1994.

 
 
 
 
 (3) Subdivisions AA, AB, AC (other than section 68), AE and AH do not apply in relation to absorbed person visas.
' 
 
 
 
 13 The Minister's position is that Mr Gadd satisfies the conditions in s 34(2) and he is therefore taken to have been granted an absorbed person visa on 1 September 1994.
Mr Gadd contends, however, that he had not, before 2 April 1984, 'ceased to be an immigrant' (see s 34(2)(b)) because he was not by then absorbed into the Australian community and says, therefore, that he cannot be taken to have been granted an absorbed person visa.
14 In O'Keefe v Caldwell [1949] HCA 6 ; (1949) 77 CLR 261 at 271 Latham CJ observed that:
 'Immigration into a country, if completed, involves two elements, (a) entry into the country, and (b) absorption into the community of a country.
' 
 
 15 In Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; ex parte T e [2002] HCA 48 ; (2002) 212 CLR 162 Gleeson CJ also drew attention to the fact that immigration and emigration are activities.
He said (at [26]) ' the concept of absorption into the Australian community, vague as it may be, has been developed as a method of indicating that the activity of immigration in which a person has engaged has come to an end' .
16 For this reason one way of testing whether a person has ceased to be an immigrant by a certain date (in this case 2 April 1984) is to ask whether such a person has by then become absorbed into the Australian community.
In the case of children the enquiry extends to an examination of the position of the parents and the family unit.
17 Under the statutory regime applying in 1971 permission to enter and remain in Australia was granted by entry permit, rather than under the current visa system.
At the time of Mr Gadd's entry, with his family, into Australia there were three forms of entry permit available.
It seems that Mr Gadd's family entered Australia upon the basis they could remain indefinitely.
Accordingly, they could begin to become members of the Australian community from the time of entry (see R v Forbes; ex parte Kwok Kwan Lee [1971] HCA 14 ; (1971) 124 CLR 168 at 173-4).
18 The affidavit material filed on behalf of Mr Gadd includes affidavits from himself and his sister Wendy Jean Morris upon which he relies to support his contention.
For the purpose of the present application I have accepted the contents of these untested affidavits at face value.
