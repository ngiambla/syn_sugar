The applicant claimed that the respondent's use of the word infringed its registered trade marks, contravened s 52 and/or ss 53(c) and (d) of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) and constituted passing off.
2 The applicant brought an application for an interlocutory injunction.
Upon the respondent giving undertakings that it would not use the name "Oxford" in connection with debt factoring, debt financing or debt collection services or outsourcing services in relation to accounts receivable administration, I dismissed the application and reserved the costs thereof: Oxford Funding Pty Ltd v Oxford Asia Pacific Investments Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 1637.
An important element was a consideration of the balance of convenience: see [14].
3 Following protracted negotiations the parties have now resolved their differences and executed a deed of settlement.
However, the question of the costs of the proceeding remains in issue.
4 The applicant submits that the respondent should pay all of its costs, or alternatively all of its costs up to and including the injunction application.
The respondent's case is that the applicant should pay its costs of the injunction application or, alternatively, that each party should bear its own costs of the whole proceeding.
All costs orders are sought on a party/party basis.
5 The Court has undoubted jurisdiction to make an order for costs notwithstanding that the proceeding has otherwise settled; see for example Australian Securities Commission v Aust-Home Investments Ltd (1993) 44 FCR 194 at 201 (Hill J), Re Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs; ex parte Lai Qin [1997] HCA 6 ; (1997) 186 CLR 622 at 624-625 (McHugh J), We Two Pty Ltd v Shorrock [2002] FCA 875 (Finkelstein J).
While any question of costs always remains a matter of discretion, the approach in the cases is usually that the Court will not try a hypothetical action to decide which party would have won.
Rather, the Court will assess the conduct of the parties including, in appropriate cases, the conduct prior to the commencement of proceedings, to see whether that conduct was "reasonable".
This rather suggests that an order will only be made where the party seeking costs has acted reasonably and the other party has not.
Where both parties have acted reasonably, or unreasonably, the costs should lie where they fall.
"Unreasonableness" in this context could include rejecting a reasonable offer or an invitation to engage in discussions which hold out reasonable prospects of a compromise.
6 In the present case, each party asserts the reasonableness of its own conduct and the unreasonableness of its opponent's.
7 My judgment on the injunction application includes a brief summary of the evidence in relation to the respective business activities of the parties.
I will treat it as incorporated in the present reasons and turn to the correspondence that passed between the parties, commencing with the applicant's letter of demand.
8 On 27 September 2005 the applicant's solicitors Middletons wrote to the respondent asserting their client's goodwill as a company that "provides funding for business' accounts receivable, collection services, credit monitoring and checks and factoring services".
The letter stated that the applicant was the registered owner of three trade marks.
It referred to the respondent's (OAPI) website in the following terms: 
 
 
 "We are instructed that OAPI operates a website in the domain name www.oxfordapi.com (the OAPI website).
This website refers to the services offered by OAPI in Australia.
Amongst other services offered by OAPI is 'factoring, invoice discounting and inventory financing divisions of bank/non-bank organisations' (the OAPI services).
The OAPI Services are services of the same description as that of the services in respect of which (the applicant's) trade marks are registered.
