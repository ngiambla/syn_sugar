 
1 This morning in Court the applicants sought leave to further amend the amended statement of claim filed 16 February 2006, and to substitute a document titled 'Further Amended Statement of Claim'.
Most of the proposed amendments to this pleading are typographical corrections, with the exception of a substantive addition to par 17A.
2 Mr Bell for the respondents indicated that the respondents accepted all amendments to the proposed further amended statement of claim other than the insertion in par 17A of six new paragraphs.
Paragraph 17A describes matters which the applicants allege the first respondent failed to disclose to the first and second applicants prior to 19 February 2005.
The matters listed in par 17A are considered by the applicants as crucial to the case of the applicants, as par 19A contains the lynchpin claim that the conduct referred to in par 17A was misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead and deceive because the first and second applicants had a reasonable expectation that the matters referred to in par 17A would be disclosed by the first respondent to them and the first respondent knew or ought to have known that the first and second applicants held such reasonable expectation.
3 The applicants seek leave to have inserted into par 17A the following paragraphs:
 
 '(f) The farm management reports for the period September 2004 to February 2005.

 (g) The email from the second respondent to the third respondent dated 7 December 2004 sent at 8.01 am on that date.

 (h) The email from the second respondent to the third respondent dated 13 January 2005 sent at 2.46 pm on that date.

 (i) The email from the second respondent to the third respondent dated 14 January 2005 sent at 3.02 pm on that date.

 (j) The email from the second respondent to the third respondent dated 19 January 2005 sent at 8.06 am on that date.

 (k) The email from the third respondent to the second respondent dated 3 February 2005 sent at 8.40 am on that date.
' 

4 Setting this material into context, I note that these paragraphs are reflective of evidence contained in pars 93, 157, 55, 153, 57, 155, 58, and 156 in the statement of the second applicant, Mr Tracy, sworn and filed 30 May 2006, which paragraphs I ordered deleted from his statement on Tuesday of this week following objection from the respondents as to the content of those paragraphs.
I ordered those paragraphs deleted because, in my view, the evidence which they contained was not encompassed by the amended statement of claim.
Mr Perry on behalf of the applicants indicated at the time of that ruling that the applicants would seek to amend the statement of claim.
