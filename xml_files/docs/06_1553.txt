 Introduction 
 
1 On 12 April 1999 Regis Towers Real Estate Pty Limited ACN 087 088 202 ('Regis Towers'), then known as Cesscut Pty Limited, was registered as a proprietary company limited by shares in accordance with the Corporations Law , which applied as a law of the State of New South Wales by virtue of the Corporations (New South Wales) Act 1990 (NSW).
In accordance with s 119 of the Corporations Law Regis Towers came into existence as a body corporate at the beginning of that day.
2 By virtue of s 1378(1) of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) ('the Corporations Act ') the registration of Regis Towers had effect, as from 15 July 2001, as if it were a registration under Part 2A.2 of the Corporations Act , its registration being taken to have commenced on 12 April 1999 (see s 1402(2) of the Corporations Act ).
3 By virtue of s 114 of the Corporations Act , Regis Towers needed to have at least one member and by virtue of s 201A(1) it needed to have at least one director ordinarily resident in Australia.
The comparable sections in the Corporations Law made similar provision in respect of the period up to 15 July 2001.
4 As it transpires Cesscut Pty Limited was registered as a shelf company by Patricia Holdings Pty Limited.
It would appear that on 19 April 1999 the original share, a redeemable preference share allotted to Mr Dalgleish of Patricia Holdings Pty Limited, was duly redeemed out of the proceeds of a fresh issue of shares.
On that day four ordinary shares in the capital of Cesscut Pty Limited were allotted, one to John Emmanuel Rose ('the bankrupt'), one to Penelope (also known as Popi) Rose, the bankrupt's former wife, one to Kerrie McInnes, a licensed real estate agent, and one to her son-in-law, Craig Stewart.
5 On 19 April 1999 the registered office of Cesscut Pty Limited was changed to Unit 1, 724 Darling Road (sic), Rozelle, NSW 2039.
6 On 28 April 1999 Cesscut Pty Limited changed its name to Regis Towers Real Estate Pty Limited and, on the same day, notice of the resolution changing the name, signed by the bankrupt, was lodged with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission.
7 On about 6 May 1999 Ms McInnes and Mr Stewart withdrew from the new enterprise and transferred their respective shares to the bankrupt so that the shareholding became, as it remained thereafter, three ordinary shares held by the bankrupt and one ordinary share held by his former wife.
At that time Mr Rose paid $218,750 to Ms McInnes to reimburse her for moneys she is said to have paid to Meriton Apartments Pty Limited on behalf of Regis Towers.
He also paid, as he put it, $1 'across the table' to each of Ms McInnes and Mr Stewart to acquire their respective shares.
8 On 18 May 1999 the registered office of Regis Towers was changed from 1/724 Darling Street, Rozelle to Unit 454, Ground Level, Regis Towers, 303 Castlereagh Street, Sydney, NSW 2000.
The relevant notification to the Australian Securities and Investments Commission dated 26 May 1999 was signed by the bankrupt and lodged on the same day.
9 Thereafter on 1 June 1999 a notification of change to office holders was lodged with the Australian Securities  Investments Commission, notifying the appointment of the bankrupt as a director and also as the secretary of Regis Towers on, so it was said, 19 April 1999.
This notice was signed by the bankrupt and dated 1 June 1999.
10 The 1999 annual return of Regis Towers lodged on 29 February 2000 showed the registered office and the principal place of business of Regis Towers as 'John Rose  Co Solicitors Suite 149 Level 2, 416 Pitt Street, Sydney, NSW 2000'.
That annual return showed the bankrupt as the sole director and the secretary.
11 It would appear that on 14 January 2003 the registered office of Regis Towers was further altered to become 'John Rose  Co Solicitors Suite 459, Level 5, 311-315 Castlereagh Street Sydney NSW 2000'.
That address became the principal place of business of Regis Towers as from 6 January 2003.
12 Whilst the position in relation to office holders of Regis Towers between 19 April 1999 and 1 June 1999 is not entirely clear, it appears that at least on 20 April 1999 the bankrupt was a director of the company and Kerrie McInnes was its secretary.
On 20 April 1999 the common seal of Cesscut Pty Limited was affixed to a deed between Cesscut Pty Limited and Meriton Apartments Pty Limited, the affixing being witnessed by the bankrupt as a director and Ms McInnes as secretary.
That deed showed the address of Cesscut Pty Limited as 74 Spit Road, Mosman, NSW 2088, being the residential address of Mr Stewart.
13 Ms McInnes' status as a secretary of Regis Towers is further evidenced by a deed made 6 August 1999 referred to as a 'DEED OF CONSENT TO SECURITY' between Meriton Apartments Pty Limited, Owners Corporation for 'The Regis Strata Plan Number 58946 (sic)' and Cesscut Pty Limited of 74 Spit Road, Mosman, NSW 2088.
That deed bears the common seals of Meriton Apartments Pty Limited ACN 000 644 888, The Owners --- Strata Plan No.
56443 and Cesscut Pty Limited ACN 087 088 202.
14 In the case of The Owners --- Strata Plan No.
56443 execution of the Deed clearly took place on 6 August 1999.
15 In the case of Cesscut Pty Limited the affixing of the common seal to the Deed was witnessed by the bankrupt as 'Director' and by Ms McInnes as 'Secretary'.
It is common ground that, in relation to the execution of the Deed by Cesscut Pty Limited, this occurred before 6 May 1999 i.e.
the date on which Ms McInnes and Mr Stewart withdrew from the new enterprise.
16 Regis Towers became a company under administration on 17 September 2004, Murray Roderick Godfrey ('the Administrator') being appointed as its Administrator in accordance with s 436A of the Corporations Act .

 
17 By force of the presentation by John Emmanuel Rose of a debtor's petition in accordance with s 55 of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth) ('the Act') and the acceptance thereof by the Official Receiver in accordance with s 55(4A) of the Act on 21 June 2005, Mr Rose became a bankrupt.
In accordance with s 156A of the Act Robert William Whitton ('the Trustee') became the Trustee of the estate of the bankrupt on the same day.
18 The bankrupt remained the sole director and secretary of Regis Towers from about 6 May 1999 until 15 August 2005.
However, he became disqualified from managing Regis Towers upon becoming a bankrupt (see s 206B(3) of the Corporations Act ).
By then, of course, Regis Towers was a company under administration.
19 Expressed in the simplest of terms, the proceedings presently before the Court require determinations to be made as to whether certain assets should inure for the benefit of the creditors of Regis Towers or for the benefit of the creditors of the bankrupt.
The competing protagonists are the Administrator and the Trustee and each has pursued his case with appropriate vigour.
20 Proceeding NSD 641 of 2006 was commenced by the Administrator by an application filed 29 March 2006.
It challenged a Notice given to the Administrator by the acting Official Receiver for the Bankruptcy District of New South Wales in relation to the estate of the bankrupt and also a Notice of Demand given by the Trustee to the Administrator.
21 On 15 May 2006 the Trustee filed a cross-application against the Administrator and Regis Towers.
Pursuant to an order made on 7 September 2006, the Administrator, personally, ceased to be a party to the cross-application.
In the cross-application the Trustee seeks relief against Regis Towers under s 121 of the Act.
22 The applicants' claims in the proceedings were resolved on 22 June 2006, a series of declarations and orders being made by consent on that day.
Responsibility for the costs of the applicants' amended application was also determined on that day.
23 The cross-application is one of the matters presently before the Court.
On 9 August 2006 leave was granted, by consent, to the Trustee to proceed with the cross-application against Regis Towers.
24 The other matter presently before the Court, matter No.
NSD 1657 of 2006, is an application, filed 29 August 2006, under s 104 of the Act by Regis Towers for review of a decision of the Trustee under s 102(1)(c) of the Act to reject a proof of debt lodged by Regis Towers with the Trustee in accordance with s 84 of the Act.
This application was filed after Regis Towers filed a 'Second Cross Application' against the Trustee in proceeding NSD 641 of 2006 on 17 July 2006, in which substantially the same relief had been sought.
25 On 7 September 2006 the Court ordered that the cross-application in proceeding NSD 641 of 2006 and proceeding NSD 1657 of 2006 be heard together with evidence in one matter to be evidence in the other.
26 On 14 July 2006 the Trustee filed an amended cross-application in NSD 641 of 2006.
That cross-application was superseded by a further amended cross-application filed 10 October 2006 which, in turn, was superseded by a second further amended cross-application filed 17 October 2006.
27 The cross-application falls to be determined by reference to a Second Further Amended Points of Cross-Claim filed 17 October 2006 and Points of Defence thereto filed by Regis Towers on 18 October 2006, the sixth and seventh days respectively, of the hearing.
28 In relation to the review of the rejection of Regis Towers' proof of debt in NSD 1657 of 2006 the Trustee filed a 'Notice Stating Grounds of Opposition to Application, Interim Application or Petition' on 19 September 2006.
29 Section 121 of the Act was amended by the Bankruptcy Legislation (Anti-avoidance) Act 2006 (Cth) which, relevantly commenced on 31 May 2006.
However the amendments only applied to transfers of property made on or after 31 May 2006.
Accordingly, the new provisions have no application to the facts of this case.
30 At the time of the transfers of property in relation to which the Trustee seeks relief s 121 of the Act provided as follows:
 
 '121(1) A transfer of property by a person who later becomes a bankrupt (the transferor ) to another person (the transferee ) is void against the trustee in the transferor's bankruptcy if: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (a) the property would probably have become part of the transferor's estate or would probably have been available to creditors if the property had not been transferred; and 
 
 (b) the transferor's main purpose in making the transfer was: 
 
 (i) to prevent the transferred property from becoming divisible among the transferor's creditors; or 
 
 (ii) to hinder or delay the process of making property available for division among the transferor's creditors.

 
 (2) The transferor's main purpose in making the transfer is taken to be the purpose described in paragraph (1)(b) if it can reasonably be inferred from all the circumstances that, at the time of the transfer, the transferor was, or was about to become, insolvent.

 
 (3) Subsection (2) does not limit the ways of establishing the transferor's main purpose in making a transfer.

 
 (4) Despite subsection (1), a transfer of property is not void against the trustee if: 
 
 (a) the consideration that the transferee gave for the transfer was at least as valuable as the market value of the property; and 
 
 (b) the transferee did not know that the transferor's main purpose in making the transfer was the purpose described in paragraph (1)(b); and 
 
 (c) the transferee could not reasonably have inferred that, at the time of the transfer, the transferor was, or was about to become, insolvent.

 
 (5) The trustee must pay to the transferee an amount equal to the value of any consideration that the transferee gave for a transfer that is void against the trustee.

 
 (6) For the purposes of subsections (4) and (5), the following have no value as consideration: 
 
 (a) the fact that the transferee is related to the transferor; 
 
 (b) if the transferee is the spouse or de facto spouse of the transferor --- the transferee making a deed in favour of the transferor; 
 
 (c) the transferee's promise to marry, or to become the de facto spouse of, the transferor; 
 
 (d) the transferee's love or affection for the transferor; 
 
 (7) This section does not apply to a transfer of property under a debt agreement.

 
 (8) This section does not affect the rights of a person who acquired property from the transferee in good faith and for at least the market value of the property.

 
 (9) For the purposes of this section: 
 
 (a) transfer of property includes a payment of money; and 
 
 (b) a person who does something that results in another person becoming the owner of property that did not previously exist is taken to have transferred the property to the other person; and 
 
 (c) the market value of property transferred is its market value at the time of the transfer.

31 In s 5(1) of the Act 'property' is defined as follows:
 
 '5(1) In this Act, unless the contrary intention appears: 
 ... 
 
 
 property means real or personal property of every description, whether situate in Australia or elsewhere, and includes any estate, interest or profit, whether present or future, vested or contingent, arising out of or incident to any such real or personal property;' 
 
 

In s 5(2) and 5(3) of the Act solvency and insolvency are defined.
These sections provide as follows:
 
 
 '5(2) A person is solvent if, and only if, the person is able to pay all the person's debts, as and when they become due and payable.

 
 
 
 (3) A person who is not solvent is insolvent .
' 
 
 
 (emphasis in original) 
 
 

32 In Sandell v Porter [1966] HCA 28 ; (1966) 115 CLR 666 at 670, Barwick CJ said:
 
 'Insolvency is ... an inability to pay debts at they fall due out of the debtor's own money.
But the debtor's own moneys are not limited to his cash resources immediately available.
They extend to moneys which he can procure by realization by sale or by mortgage or pledge of his assets within a relatively short time---relative to the nature and amount of the debts and to the circumstances, including the nature of the business, of the debtor.
The conclusion of insolvency ought to be clear from a consideration of the debtor's financial position in its entirety and generally speaking ought not to be drawn simply from evidence of a temporary lack of liquidity.
It is the debtor's inability, utilising such cash resources as he has or can command through the use of his assets, to meet his debts as they fall due which indicates insolvency.
...' 

33 In Expo International Pty Limited (Receivers and Managers Appointed) (In Liq) v Chant [1979] 2 NSWLR 820 at 837-9, Needham J said in relation to a company's solvency:
 
 '"Solvent" ... does not mean ... merely an absence of creditors knocking at the door.
A company is not necessarily solvent on a particular day if it was, on that day, in a position to meet any demand lawfully made by a creditor.
It may be necessary to investigate the sources from which such payments might be made.
If, for example, the company could pay one debt only by borrowing from someone else, its solvency could come into question: cf Re Australian Co-operative Development Society Ltd. It is clear that a lack of liquidity is not equivalent to insolvency; I think the converse is also true, namely, that the fact that a company has liquid assets is not conclusive of its solvency.

 ... 
 ... What he is saying [referring to Barwick CJ's judgment in Sandell v Porter ] , in my opinion, is that, if temporary inability to pay debts is established, one can look at the debtor's asset position to see whether the temporary embarrassment is caused only by a lack of liquidity.
If it is, then one should take account of readily realisable assets.
Of course, it follows that, in doing so, one is looking to the future and, in my opinion, if one does so in order to see whether a temporary lack of liquidity can be overcome, one cannot overlook debts which will become payable during the period in which the lack of liquidity is being cured.
' 
 

34 In relation to a trustee's consideration of proofs of debt s 102 of the Act relevantly provided:
 
 '102(1) The trustee shall examine each proof of debt and the grounds of the debt sought to be proved and, ... shall, ... either: 
 
 (a) admit the proof of debt in whole; 
 
 (b) admit it in part and reject it in part; 
 
 (c) reject it in whole; or 
 
 (d) require further evidence in support of it.

 
 (2) Where the trustee rejects a proof of debt in whole or in part, he or she shall inform the creditor by whom it was lodged, in writing, of the grounds of the rejection.

 ...' 
 

35 In relation to appeals against decisions of a trustee in respect of proofs of debt, s 104 relevantly provided:
 
 ' 104(1) A creditor ... may apply to the Court for review of a decision of the trustee under subsection 102(1) ... in respect of a proof of debt.

 
 (2) The Court may, upon the application, confirm, reverse or vary the decision of the trustee.

 
 (3) Subject to the power of the Court to extend the time, an application under this section to review a decision shall not be heard by the Court unless it was made within 21 days from the date on which the decision was made.

 The Meriton development 
 
36 Lot 200 in DP 874377 would appear to have been an irregular shaped parcel of land with frontages to Pitt, Castlereagh and Campbell Streets in the Haymarket area of Sydney and to have been owned by Meriton Property Management Pty Limited ACN 002 298 464.
The Council of the City of Sydney duly consented to a Development Application in respect of the land, being Application No 724/96.
37 Under s 41 of the Strata Schemes (Freehold Development) Act 1973 (NSW) the Registrar-General is empowered to register, amongst other things, strata plans and strata plans of subdivision.
Upon the registration of a strata plan for a strata scheme, an owners corporation is established as a body corporate under the name 'The Owners --- Strata Plan No X' ('X' being the registered number of the strata plan to which that strata scheme relates).
(See ss 8 and 11 of the Strata Schemes Management Act 1996 (NSW).
)
 
38 Section 41(2) of the Strata Schemes Management Act 1996 (NSW) relevantly provided in respect of by-laws applicable to a strata scheme:
 
 '41 ... 
 
 
 
 
 (2) The by-laws in force for a strata scheme are the by-laws adopted by or lodged with the strata plan registered by the Registrar-General for the strata scheme, as in force at the date of lodgement, subject to any amendment, repeal or addition recorded by the Registrar-General under section 48 ' 
 
 
 
 

39 On 30 January 1998 Strata Plan No 56443 was duly registered in respect of the land, resulting in the creation of Lots 1 --- 155.
Lots 1 --- 153 had Unit Entitlements varying from 7 out of an aggregate of 10,000 to 56 out of an aggregate of 10,000.
Lot 154 had a Unit Entitlement of 5,094 out of an aggregate of 10,000 and Lot 155 had a Unit Entitlement of 2,644 out of an aggregate of 10,000.
40 At the time of the registration of Strata Plan No 56443 a 32 level brick and concrete residential and commercial building fronting Pitt Street, with car parking under part thereof, had been constructed on part of the land.
The Pitt Street tower was known as 414 --- 418 Pitt Street, Sydney.
41 On 3 March 1999 Strata Plan No 58946, being a subdivision of Lots 154 and 155 in Strata Plan No 56443, was duly registered.
By Strata Plan No 58946, new Lots 156 --- 455 were created.
The Unit Entitlements for Lots 1 --- 153 covered by SP 56443 remained in place.
The Unit Entitlements attributed to the new Lots 156 --- 454 varied from 1 out of an aggregate of 10,000 to 43 out of an aggregate of 10,000.
Lot 455 had a Unit Entitlement of 2,974 out of an aggregate of 10,000.
42 By the time of the registration of SP 58946 a 43 level brick and concrete residential and commercial building (including car parking under) had been constructed on the northern part of the land fronting on to Castlereagh Street.
The Castlereagh Street tower was known as 303 --- 321 Castlereagh Street, Sydney.
43 On 2 November 1999 Strata Plan No 61369 was duly registered as a strata plan of subdivision of Lot 455 in Strata Plan No 58946.
By the time of the registration of Strata Plan No 61369 a 36 level brick and concrete residential and commercial building (including car parking under) had been constructed on the land with frontages to Campbell and Castlereagh Streets.
Upon the registration of Strata Plan No 61369 Lots 456 --- 650 were created, the Unit Entitlements of which varied from 1 to 26 out of an aggregate of 2,974, being the Unit Entitlement out of an aggregate of 10,000 previously applicable to Lot 455 in Strata Plan No 58946.
The street address for the Campbell Street tower was 317 --- 321 Castlereagh Street, Sydney.
44 The By-Laws for the Strata Scheme which came into existence upon the registration of SP 56443 included provision for the owner of a lot to have rights in respect of part of the common property designated 'Caretaker-Manager's Office', to perform the responsibilities of a caretaker (see By-Law 25).
45 The By-Laws also empowered the Owners Corporation to appoint and enter into an agreement with a security company for the security of any building and common property (see By-Law 27).
46 By dealing number 6029751N the By-Laws for the common property Strata Plan No 56443 were changed with the addition of Special By-Laws 1, 2, 3 and 4.
Thereafter, by dealing number 6150919W Special By-Laws 1 --- 4, said to have been made on 12 July 1999, were replaced by new Special By-Laws to which the common seal of The Owners --- Strata Plan No 56443 was affixed on 1 September 1999.
The substituted Special By-Laws 1 -4 were generally in accord with the original Special By-Laws 1 --- 4.
They did, however, tighten up the rights of the owners of Lots 149, 454, 488 and 650 under the Special By-Laws and also the rights of the Caretaker-Manager under Special By-Law 3.
In addition a new Special By-Law 6 was added conferring rights on the owner for the time being of Lot 144 in respect of exclusive use and enjoyment of part of the common property.
47 Special By-Law 1 empowered the Owners Corporation 'to appoint and enter into an agreement with a Caretaker-Manager to provide management, leasing, security, cleaning and operational services for the strata scheme'.
Special By-Law 2 provided for the owner for the time being of Lot 149 to have the exclusive use and enjoyment of an area of 28.3 square metres designated as 'reception, amenities room, two stores and toilet' on a plan dated 3 June 1999 and a special privilege in respect of such area:
 
 'to conduct therein for the provision of services to the owners and occupiers to lots in the Strata Scheme, the business of real estate agent, the functions of a caretaker, and any of the following businesses:- 
 
 1.
Supply of linen; 
 2.
Housekeeping and cleaning; 
 
 
 3.
Catering, insofar as it consists in the delivery of foodstuffs and beverages to lots within the strata scheme; 
 
 
 4.
Butler and valet; 
 5.
Porterage; 
 6.
Dry cleaning and laundry; 
 7.
Vehicle, taxi and limousine hire; 
 8.
Entertainment, restaurant and tour reservations; 
 9.
Video tape hire; 
 10.
Supply of newspapers, plants and flowers; 
 11.
Booking of air and other travel and accommodation; 
 12.
Purposes permitted by Special By-Law 1.
' 
 

48 Special By-Law 3 provided that owners of lots should not interfere with or obstruct the Caretaker-Manager and Special By-Law 4 provided that owners of lots should not, except with the written consent of the owners of Lots 149, 454, 488 and 650, conduct or participate in the conduct of a business which provides services in the nature of:
 
 'a.
The business of a letting agent; or 
 
 b.
The business of a pooled rent agency; or 
 
 c. The business of on-site caretaker, security, cleaner; or 
 
 d. any other business activity that is either:- 
 
 
 
 
 i.
An activity identical or substantially identical with any of the services relating to the management, control and administration of the parcel referred to in Special By-Law 1 and/or the Caretaker-Manager Agreement; and/or 
 
 ii.
An activity identical or substantially identical with any of the services provided to owners and occupiers of the lots referred to in Special By-Law 1, and/or the Caretaker-Manager Agreement; and/or 
 
 iii.
Any activity identical or substantially identical with any of the services relating to the letting of lots referred to in Special By-Law 1, and/or the Caretaker-Manager Agreement.

 
 
 
 
 e. Any of the following businesses:- 
 
 
 
 1.
Supply of linen; 
 2.
Housekeeping and cleaning; 
 
 
 
 
 3.
Catering, insofar as it consists in the delivery of foodstuffs and beverages to lots within the strata scheme; 
 4.
Butler and valet; 
 5.
Porterage; 
 6.
Dry cleaning and laundry; 
 7.
Vehicle, taxi and limousine hire; 
 8.
Entertainment, restaurant and tour reservations; 
 9.
Purposes permitted by Special By-Law No.
1.
' 
 
 
 
 

49 Special By-Law 4, amongst other things, conferred a right on Meriton Apartments Pty Limited to 'use Lots 446 and 642 for the purpose of or related to the sale of lots in the strata scheme, for so long as Meriton Apartments Pty Limited (sic) owns a lot or lots in the strata scheme'.
50 There is no evidence that Meriton Apartments Pty Limited ever owned any lots in the strata scheme.
The relevant owner of lots in the scheme was Meriton Property Management Pty Limited.
51 Plainly, the rights conferred on the owners for the time being of lots 149, 454, 488 and 650 and the rights conferred under Special By-Law 1 on any Caretaker/Manager appointed by the owners corporation were of considerable value.
John Rose  Co 
 
52 The bankrupt was admitted to practice as a legal practitioner in New South Wales on 5 July 1985.
The Law Almanac for 1998, to which the parties have agreed that the Court may have regard, showed him to be a suburban solicitor practising from 1/724 Darling Street, Rozelle under the firm name 'John Rose  Co, Solicitors  Attorneys'.
The Law Almanac for 1999 contains an identical listing.
53 As at 17 March 1999 John Rose  Co's facsimile cover sheets showed the firm's business premises as being 'Rozelle Chambers, 1/724 Darling Street, Rozelle NSW 2039'.
54 The bankrupt moved away from practising as a solicitor towards the end of 1998, after which he ceased to take on new matters.
Purchase of lots in the Meriton development by the bankrupt 
 
55 In February 1999 the bankrupt had his first contact with Mr Harry Londy of Australian Property and Management Pty Limited of Shop 5, 'University Hall', 281 --- 285 Parramatta Road, Glebe, an agent for Meriton Property Management Pty Limited, the owner of the lots in the Meriton development.
Whilst no contracts for the purchase of any of the lots in the various strata plans to which the bankrupt was a party, are in evidence, it seems clear that the first contracts, to which the bankrupt was a party were entered into on 1 March 1999 when he agreed to purchase Lot 564 in what later became Strata Plan No 61369 'off the plan' for $411,000 and also Lot 565 in what later became Strata Plan No 61369 'off the plan' for $353,000.
56 Details of the transfers of lots into the name of the bankrupt or the bankrupt and his former wife, Popi Rose, are set out in the table appearing hereunder.
Date of transfer Lot No Strata Plan No Purchaser/s Consideration 7.7.99 417 58946 Bankrupt  wife $620,000 12.11.99 582 61369 Bankrupt $447,000 12.11.99 587 61369 Bankrupt $451,000 18.11.99 567 61369 Bankrupt $420,000 19.11.99 471 61369 Bankrupt $155,000 19.11.99 564 61369 Bankrupt $411,000 22.11.99 505 61369 Bankrupt  wife $420,000 22.11.99 561 61369 Bankrupt $426,500 22.11.99 565 61369 Bankrupt $353,000 3.12.99 501 61369 Bankrupt  wife $425,000 10.12.99 459 61369 Bankrupt $ 475,000 $ 4,603,500 
57 It can be seen from the above table that the bankrupt and his former wife purchased one lot in the Castlereagh Street tower strata plan registered on 3 March 1999 and two lots in the Campbell Street tower strata plan registered on 2 November 1999.
The bankrupt acquired, in his own name, eight lots in the Campbell Street tower strata plan.
Purchase of lots in the Meriton development by Regis Towers 
 
58 Apart from the purchases made by Mr Rose either on his own account or as a joint tenant with his former wife, Regis Towers purchased a number of lots in the Meriton development from Meriton Property Management Pty Limited.
In the case of the purchases effected by Regis Towers (then known as Cesscut Pty Limited) three contracts are in evidence, each dated 20 April 1999.
Details of the purchases the subject of those contracts are set out in the table appearing hereunder:
 Date of contract Lot No Strata Plan No Purchaser/s Consideration 20.4.99 454 58586 (sic) Cesscut Pty Limited $60,000 20.4.99 488 (later 61369) Cesscut Pty Limited $318,000 20.4.99 650 (later 61369) Cesscut Pty Limited $450,000 

 
59 Each of the contracts entered into on 20 April 1999 was executed under the common seal of Cesscut Pty Limited, the affixing of the common seal being witnessed by Mr Rose as Director and Ms McInnes as Secretary.
60 Whilst the contract for the purchase of Lot 454 shows the relevant strata plan as Strata Plan No 58586, it seems clear that the intention of the parties was that the subject matter of the contract would be Lot 454 in Strata Plan No 58946 which had been registered on 3 March 1999.
61 The purchases of Lots 488 and 650 were 'off the plan' and related to the strata plan which later became registered as Strata Plan No 61369 on 2 November 1999.
62 The deposit payable in respect of Lot 454 was $4,500, in the case of Lot 488 it was $15,900 and in the case of Lot 650 it was $33,750.
63 In each of the contracts Meriton Apartments Pty Limited ACN 000 644 888 was shown as the 'vendor's representative'.
Each contract provided for the deposit 'To be released to Meriton Apartments Pty Ltd as at the date hereof'.
64 Details of the transfers of lots from Meriton Property Management Pty Limited to Regis Towers are set out in the table appearing hereunder:
 Date of transfer Lot No Strata Plan No Consideration 6.8.99 149 56443 $320,000 6.8.99 454 58586 (sic) $60,000 3.12.99 488 61369 $318,000 3.12.99 489 61369 $350,000 3.12.99 650 61369 $450,000 

 
65 From the above table it can be seen that Regis Towers purchased one lot in the Pitt Street tower strata plan, one lot in the Castlereagh Street tower strata plan and three lots 'off the plan' in the Campbell Street tower strata plan.
The Head Agreement 
 
66 Apart from entering into contracts for the purchase of a number of lots in the Meriton development on 20 April 1999, Regis Towers, then known as Cesscut Pty Limited of '74 Spit Road, Mosman NSW 2088', also entered into a deed with Meriton Apartments Pty Limited ACN 000 644 888 on that day.
67 In the deed Meriton Apartments Pty Limited is described as the 'Developer' and Regis Towers as the 'Caretaker'.
The deed made provision for Meriton Apartments Pty Limited to procure the 'Owners Corporation' to resolve to enter into a proposed Caretaker-Manager Agreement in respect of the complex, a copy of which was said to be contained in Schedule 2 to the deed.
Neither copy of the deed contains a form of Caretaker-Manager (or Caretaker-Management) Agreement in Schedule 2.
68 The bankrupt says that he saw a draft Caretaker-Management Agreement in Mr Londy's office at Glebe on or about 16 April 1999.
69 One copy of the deed which is in evidence contains two copies of the page which commences with clause 4 but lacks the page commencing with clause 2.3.
No issue arising from the apparent lack of correspondence between the part and counterpart has been raised.
70 For the rights conferred on Regis Towers by the deed Regis Towers agreed to pay Meriton Apartments Pty Limited $1,750,000 by way of consideration.
71 The deed was executed under the common seal of Meriton Apartments Pty Limited ACN 000 644 888, the counterpart being executed under the common seal of Cesscut Pty Limited ACN 087 088 202.
Once again the affixing of the common seal was witnessed by the bankrupt as director and by Kerrie McInnes as secretary.

73 Schedule 2 to the deed provided as follows:
 
 'SCHEDULE 2 
 
 PROPOSED CARETAKER-MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT' 
 

As noted above, no proposed Caretaker-Management Agreement appears to have been included in the deed.
74 Annexure A to the deed was a draft mortgage in favour of Meriton Finance Pty Limited ACN 086 507 280.
Caretaker-Management Agreement 
 
75 On or about 17 August 1999 an agreement was entered into between The Owners --- Strata Plan No 56443 and Regis Towers.
Whilst the agreement bears date 6 August 1999, it is clear that it was only executed by Regis Towers on 17 August 1999.
76 The common seal of Regis Towers was affixed to the agreement in the presence of the bankrupt as a director.
77 The agreement relevantly provided:
 
 ' RECITALS 
 
 
 
 A.
The Owners Corporation has responsibility for the management of its strata scheme and has been authorised to enter into this Agreement with respect to the complex known as "The Regis" Cnr Campbell, Pitt  Castlereagh Streets, SYDNEY 
 
 B.
To assist it in the performance of this responsibility, the Owners Corporation wishes to appoint a Caretaker.

 
 C. The parties have agreed that for this purpose, the Owners Corporation exclusively will engage the Caretaker to perform certain functions, on the terms set out in this Agreement.

 
 OPERTATIVE (sic) PROVISIONS 
 
 Appointment as Caretaker 
 
 1.
The Owners Corporation engages the Caretaker to perform the duties set out in Schedule 2 in a conscientious, expeditious and workmanlike manner so as to maintain the common areas of the building and to permit them to be enjoyed to a standard appropriate to a residential development and the Caretaker accepts the engagement upon the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

 
 2.
For the performance by the Caretaker of its duties specified in Schedule 2, the Owners Corporation must pay the Caretaker the sum per annum specified in Item 2 of Schedule 1, in equal fortnightly instalments in arrears.

 
 
 
 [Schedule 2 comprised several pages.
The first page had the heading " DUTIES OF CARETAKER ' followed by alphabetically identified paragraphs (a) to (ax) inclusive.
However, the copy of the agreement which is in evidence does not include the page which presumably recorded paragraphs (v) to (z) inclusive.
The next section of Schedule 2 bore the heading "CLEANING DUTIES ' which recorded a number of obligations in alphabetically identified paragraphs (a) --- (j) inclusive.
The final part of Schedule 2 had a heading " CONCIERGE DUTIES " which was followed by a number of obligations in alphabetically identified paragraphs (a) --- (i) inclusive.
At the conclusion of Schedule 2 the following words appeared:
 
 
 
 "All of the foregoing activities shall be undertaken and carried out by the Caretaker at the reasonable direction of the Owners Corporation and shall not be a delegation of any duty or obligation of the Owners Corporation.
This Agreement shall not operate as an appointment of the Caretaker as a 'Strata Managing Agent' under Section 27 of the Strata Schemes Management Act 1996 .
" ]
 
 
 
 [The payment obligation identified in Item 2 of Schedule 1 was $586,000 per annum for the "Pitt Tower  Castlereagh Street Tower" and $90,000 per annum for the "Campbell Towers", a total of $676,000 per annum.
] 
 
 
 
 ... 
 
 Leasing and Sales Agency 
 
 4.
The Caretaker may provide the following services as agent for owners of lots in the building, at their request and subject to the settlement between the Caretaker and the owners of the terms on which the services are to be provided: 
 
 
 
 
 
 1.
Buying, selling, leasing, assigning or otherwise disposing of lots within the strata scheme; and 
 
 2.
Collecting rents payable in respect of any lease of lots within the strata scheme.

 
 
 
 
 
 The consideration for the Owners Corporation granting the Caretaker the right to conduct the services is the Caretaker conducting the activities associated and incidental to these services if the Caretaker elects to do so.
In no circumstances shall the Owners Corporation be liable to pay the Caretaker remuneration for these services, or to reimburse for it (sic) any expenses in providing these services.

 
 5.
The Caretaker may conduct the business of providing these services from Lots 489, 454 and 650 pursuant to rights conferred on the owner of the Caretaker's lots (being the lot specified in Item 3 of Schedule 1) by a by-law of the type referred to in Section 51 of the Strata Schemes Management Act 1996 the terms of which are set out in Schedule 3.

 
 
 
 [The Caretaker's lots referred to Item 3 of Schedule 1 to the agreement were lots 454, 489 and 650 in Strata Plan No 56443.
]
 
 [" SHEDULE (sic) 3 " to the agreement set out three by-laws numbered 34, 35 and 36 which dealt with the relationship between the Owners Corporation and a Caretaker, protection of the rights of a Caretaker and precluding the owners of other lots from carrying on business in competition with a Caretaker.
The preamble to the " BY-LAW 36 " provided:
 
 
 
 "The owner or occupier of every Lot excepts Lots 489, 454 and 650 must not on any Lot or the common property, except with the written consent of the owners of Lots 489, 454 and 650 conduct or participate in the conduct of: 
 
 (a) the business of ..." 
 
 
 
 It can be seen that rights were conferred on Lot 489 which were presumably intended to be conferred on Lot 488.
Hence, Regis Towers purchased both lots 488 and 489 in Strata Plan No 61369.
]
 
 ...
 Duties of the Owners Corporation 
 
 
 
 26.1 The Owners Corporation must do all acts and attend to all matters and generally do all things as are reasonably required to facilitate the carrying out by the Caretaker of its duties, powers and obligations in this Agreement, including, but without limiting the generality of the foregoing; 
 
 
 
 
 
 1. assisting the Caretaker in obtaining appropriate notices, consents or licences from any person, company, statutory authority or other body; 
 
 2. giving any necessary authorisation pursuant to clause 11.

 
 
 
 
 [Clause 11 authorised the Caretaker to pledge the credit of the Owners Corporation to a limit of $1,500 per month.
] 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 26.2 The Owners Corporation must provide the Caretaker --- manager with a set of plans of the Lots and Common Property, to assist the manager in performing its duties.
The plans will remain the property of the Owners Corporation and must be returned to the Owners Corporation upon the expiration or sooner determination of this Agreement.

 
 26.3 The Executive Committee of the Owners Corporation must from time to time authorise one of its members to give instructions to and communicate with the Caretaker on behalf of the Owners Corporation and not more than one member of the Executive Committee at any one time must be given such authority.

 ...' 
 
 
 
 Payments 
 
78 The evidence does not exhaustively detail all relevant payments.
79 What is known is that on 20 April 1999 Kerrie McInnes drew a number of cheques on a bank account in her name at the Jannali, NSW branch of Commonwealth Bank of Australia.
At least three of those cheques were drawn in favour of 'Meriton Apartments P/L'.
Those cheques were in the following amounts:
 Cheque No.
Amount of Cheque 371 $82,500 372 $15,900 374 $16,500 
 
 
80 It would appear that the cheque number 372 was drawn by Ms McInnes in favour of Meriton Apartments Pty Limited as Meriton Property Management Pty Limited's 'vendor's representative' to cover the deposit payable by Regis Towers under the contract for the purchase of the proposed Lot 488 in the strata plan which became Strata Plan No 61369.
It is common ground that Ms McInnes' cheques were used to meet all the deposit obligations of Regis Towers under the several contracts entered into by Regis Towers on 20 April 1999 with Meriton Property Management Pty Limited and/or Meriton Apartments Pty Limited.
Such cheques appear to have totalled $218,750.
81 As part of the arrangement between the bankrupt, his former wife, Ms McInnes and Mr Stewart for the withdrawal of Ms McInnes and Mr Stewart from the joint enterprise it became necessary for the bankrupt to reimburse Ms McInnes for the $218,750 she had paid on Regis Towers' behalf by way of deposit.
82 As indicated above, the bankrupt did so on or about 6 May 1999, raising the necessary funds by borrowing $327,000 from Raymond Howes and Helen Linsey Howes, Peter Cole and Dorothy Cole, Thomas and Pamela Bradshaw, Alice Pauline Edwards and Lesley Berry, third party mortgage security being provided by Popi Rose's parents, Christos Pappas and Eugenia Pappas over their property known as 14 Birchgrove Road, Balmain.
83 On 6 May 1999 the bankrupt authorised and directed the solicitors for the lenders to pay the amount of $327,000 as follows:
 
 1.
Kerrie McInnes $218,750.00
 2.
Nugent Wallman  Carter (the lenders' solicitors in 
respect of the lenders' legal costs) $3,214.00
 3.
Land Titles Office in respect of registration fees for the mortgage $56.00
 4.
Office of State Revenue (stamp duty on the mortgage) $1,249.00
 5.
The bankrupt $103,731.00.


 The direction to pay the amount advanced in that way was also signed by Mr and Mrs Pappas.
84 It is common ground that on or about 6 May 1999 Kerrie McInnes received $218,750.00 borrowed by the bankrupt as aforesaid.
85 On 6 August 1999 the bankrupt drew a cheque (number 007) in the sum of $257,814.51 on a Cash Management Call Account in his name at the Liverpool and Castlereagh Streets, Sydney branch of Commonwealth Bank of Australia in favour of Meriton Apartments Pty Ltd.
The cheque butt recorded the purpose of the payment as 'Settlement of Management Rights'.
86 It will be recalled that 6 August 1999 was the date that the Caretaker-Management agreement bore, even though it was not executed by Regis Towers until 17 August 1999.
6 August 1999 was also the date on which Regis Towers settled the purchase of Lot 149 in Strata Plan No 56443 and also Lot 454 in Strata Plan No 58946 from Meriton Property Management Pty Limited.
By virtue of the settlement of the purchase of Lot 454, $1,017,500 became payable by Regis Towers to Meriton Apartments Pty Limited under the head agreement made 20 April 1999 (see clause 3.1(b)).
87 The bank statement in respect of the bankrupt's Cash Management Call Account shows that cheques 007, 008 and 009 were all cleared through the account on 9 August 1999.
The bankrupt's secretary, Rada Popovski, noted on the bank statement for the period 13 July 1999 to 6 September 1999 that cheque 007 in the amount of $257,814.51 was for 'Settlement of Management Rights', cheque number 008 in the sum of $35,790.89 was for 'Settlement 149 PT', which I would understand to be a reference to Lot 149 in Strata Plan No 56443, and cheque 009 in the sum of $14,499.47 was for 'Settlement 454 CT', which I would understand to be a reference to Lot 454 in what was in fact Strata Plan 58946.
88 The balance of the $1,017,500.00 payable by Regis Towers to Meriton Apartments Pty Limited pursuant to clause 3.1(b) of the head agreement of 20 April 1999, upon the settlement of the purchase of Lot 454 on 6 August 1999, was provided by an unsecured loan in the sum of $770,000 from Meriton Finance Pty Limited to Regis Towers dated 6 August 1999.
A form of mortgage document over unidentified real estate was stamped in respect of a total advance of $770,000 on 6 August 1999.
89 The bankrupt appears to have opened the above-mentioned Cash Management Call Account on 13 July 1999 with a deposit of $491,232.92.
The closing credit balance on the account as at 6 September 1999 was $45,765.55.
90 The bankrupt obtained the amount of $491,232.92, which was credited to his Cash Management Call Account on 13 July 1999 by mortgaging Lot 24 in DP 192676 being the property known as 736 Darling Street, Rozelle of which, at the time, the bankrupt and his brother Nicholas Rose were registered proprietors as tenants in common in equal shares.
The bankrupt held a power of attorney from his brother Nicholas.
He proceeded to mortgage the Darling Street, Rozelle property in favour of Permanent Trustee Australia Limited, having secured a revaluation of the property from Alcorn Lupton  Associates on 14 May 1999.
91 I would interpolate that a standard technique employed by the bankrupt to generate cash flow both for himself and Regis Towers was to acquire properties at one price, funding a significant proportion of the purchase price with borrowed funds secured over the property purchased, then obtaining revaluations of the properties at higher amounts, which valuations were used to obtain refinancing of the properties in greater sums, thereby allowing the original financier to be paid and surplus funds generated.
92 Part of a bank statement referable to the bankrupt's Cash Management Call Account for the period 16 November --- 1 December 1999 is in evidence.
It indicated that there was a credit balance in the account as at 16 November of $422,287.27 which rose to a credit balance of $428,100.89 as at 30 November 1999.
A further extract from a bank statement covering the period 7 December 1999 to 24 December 1999 in respect of the Cash Management Call Account shows it as having a credit balance as at 7 December 1999 of $58,374.79 and a closing credit balance as at 24 December 1999 of $18,553.29.
93 Neither of the last two mentioned extracts from bank statements referable to the bankrupt's Cash Management Call Account shows the payment of cheque number 112, although a strong inference is available that it was presented for payment and paid in the first week of December 1999.
94 The cheque butt referable to cheque number 112 indicates that is was drawn on 2 December 1999 in the sum of $361,103.28 and made payable to 'Meriton Apartments' for 'settlement' of Lots 501 ($26,663.40), 488 ($35,925.48), 489 ($39,188.67) and 650 ($259,325.73).
95 From the foregoing it may be inferred that out of the amount of $361,103.28 paid by the bankrupt to Meriton Apartments on or about 2 December 1999 , $26,663.40 was paid in relation to the settlement of the purchase by the bankrupt and his former wife, Popi Rose, of Lot 501, the balance of $334,439.88 having been paid by the bankrupt in relation to the settlement of purchases by Regis Towers of Lots 488, 489 and 650 in Strata Plan No 61369 from Meriton Property Management Pty Limited.
96 It may be observed that on 3 December 1999 Meriton Finance Pty Limited lent $455,000 to Regis Towers to facilitate the final payment of $601,250 by Regis Towers to Meriton Apartments Pty Limited which was due under clause 3.1(c) of the Head Agreement dated 20 April 1999 upon the settlement of the sale of Lot 650.
On 3 December 1999, Meriton Finance Pty Limited also lent $315,000 to Regis Towers on the security of Lot 650 in Strata Plan No 61369 to facilitate the settlement of its purchase.
The payment by the bankrupt of $259,325.73 to 'Meriton Apartments' referred to above covered not only the balance due to Meriton Property Management Pty Limited as vendor of Lot 650 in DP 61369 but also the balance due to Meriton Apartments Pty Limited under clause 3.1(c) of the Head Agreement.
Regis Towers' Proof of Debt 
 
97 By letter dated 28 February 2006 the Trustee forwarded to the Administrator a proof of debt asserting that Regis Towers was indebted to the bankrupt in the sum of $288,062.79.
The covering letter included:
 
 'I refer to previous communications and enclose a proof of debt in relation to amounts not claimed under my caveat or pursuant to the Section 139ZQ notice.

 
 I reserve my right to lodge further claims, including in relation to the amounts claimed under my caveat and pursuant to the Section 139ZQ notice.
' 
 

98 By letter dated 20 March 2006 the Administrator responded to the Trustee's proof of debt dated 28 February 2006 stating, inter alia:
 
 'As discussed below I am of the opinion most if not all the amounts claimed have been accounted for by the Company in the director's loan account.
Consequently, as the director's loan account is in debit there is no claim by Mr Rose against the company.
' 
 

99 The Administrator's letter of 20 March 2006 concluded with the making by Regis Towers of a claim of indebtedness on the part of the bankrupt to Regis Towers.
Under the heading ' Further Proof of Debt ' the Administrator's letter continued:
 
 'I attach an additional proof of debt in the estate for $483,970.21 being the balance of the director's loan account as at 31 December 2003 ... 
 
 I have attached a CD containing copies of the accounts and the loan account transaction account for your information in support of the claim.
' 
 

100 The proof of debt forwarded to the trustee under cover of the Administrator's letter of 20 March 2006 was in the form of a 'Statement of Claim and Proxy Form'.
The form was signed by the Administrator on behalf of Regis Towers on 13 March 2006.
It described the relationship between the bankrupt and Regis Towers as:
 
 'DEBTOR IS A FORMER DIRECTOR OF REGIS TOWERS REAL ESTATE PTY LTD' 
 

Particulars of the transactions/circumstances giving rise to Regis Towers' claims were:
 
 'LOAN ACCOUNT 
 
 As per attached accounts $483,970.21' 
 
 
 

101 The Trustee acknowledges that the 'Statement of Claim and Proxy Form' lodged by Regis Towers with him under cover of the Administrator's letter dated 20 March 2006 constituted a Proof of Debt within the meaning of s 102 of the Act which the Trustee rejected in whole in accordance with s 102(1)(c) of the Act.
102 A ledger account number 2140 in respect of 'Loans to directors' for the year ended 30 June 2000 was prepared for Regis Towers by Mr Harris of Messrs Harris Cottis, an accountant who was retained by the bankrupt in about 2002 to prepare a tax return for him for the financial year ended 30 June 2000.
Mr Harris also prepared financial accounts for Regis Towers for the periods ended 30 June 2000 and 30 June 2001 at that time.
103 The sole director of the company in the financial year ended 30 June 2000 was the bankrupt.
His loan account in the books of the company prepared as mentioned above contained 90 entries recording what were said to be some 63 payments made by Regis Towers on the bankrupt's behalf and three receipts of monies from the bankrupt, although the details of those receipts are imprecise.
There was one minor accounting adjustment in respect of an amount of one cent and 23 journal entries, one said to have been made on 1 July 1999 in respect of an amount of $4 and 22 entries said to have been made on 30 June 2000.
The evidence is that the journal entries were initiated by Mr Harris.
However, the evidence does not support the conclusion that the journal entries were made in accordance with the bankrupt's instructions or with his acquiescence.
Indeed, the evidence is that the bankrupt only recently saw the ledger account detailing the journal entries for the first time.
104 Were the entries in the ledger account reflective of the true indebtedness of Regis Towers to the bankrupt and of the bankrupt to Regis Towers it would follow that as at 30 June 2000 the bankrupt owed Regis Towers $7,875.46 being the product of deducting all of the credits totalling $1,458,365.65 from $1,466,241.11 being the total of all of the debits.
105 The Trustee has acknowledged that if the 30 June 2000 balance of $7,875.46 was truly owing by the bankrupt to Regis Towers as at 30 June 2000, then it would follow that the amount owing by the bankrupt to Regis Towers at 31 December 2003, being the date mentioned in the Administrator's letter of 20 March 2006, would be $483,970.21 as claimed by Regis Towers, subject to one matter to which I will return later.
106 The primary issue in respect of the rejection by the Trustee of Regis Towers' proof of debt revolves around the reliability of the stated indebtedness as at 30 June 2000 of the bankrupt to Regis Towers of $7,875.46.
107 Of critical significance to the establishment of the starting figure of $7,875.46 is the debiting to the bankrupt's loan account of an amount of $1,198,969.72 by journal entry on 30 June 2000 described simply as 'Take up Balance of Funds Borrowed per li'.
108 The credit side of the journal entry whereby the bankrupt's loan account was debited with $1,198,969.72 is to be found in a ledger account number 3565 produced by Mr Harris and described as 'Loans from other persons'.
This ledger account shows an indebtedness by the company to a person or persons unknown of $3,378,800 made up of 'reallocation' $2,179,830.28 and 'Take up Balance of Funds Borrowed per li' in the amount of $1,198,969.72.
109 The 'reallocation' in the sum of $2,179,830.28 is itself the subject of a journal entry made by Mr Harris on 30 June 2000.
No evidence has been provided to found Mr Harris' journal entries in the amounts mentioned and, in particular, the journal entry referrable to the amount of $1,198,969.72.
110 In relation to the making of journal entries generally Mr Harris gave the following evidence:
 
 
 Q.
'Can you recall whether or not in either of the two years in which you were involved you initiated journal entries?
' 
 
 
 
 A.
'I am sure we would have.
' 
 
 
 
 Q.
'Do you recall whether or not Mr Rose initiated any journal entries which he directed you to make?
' 
 
 A.
'Not specifically.
It wasn't a matter of him identifying the transaction and saying, that shouldn't be there it should be over here or in a different account.
There were instances where he was not sure about certain things and wanted me to have a look at the transactions.
' 
 ... 
 Q.
'So this is the position, that the journal entries that one finds in the general ledger were done by you and your staff; is that correct?
' 
 
 A.
'Yes.
' 
 
 Q.
'And they were done by you and your staff without the direction of Mr Rose; is that correct?
' 
 
 A.
'By him ...' 
 
 Q.
'Well, Mr Rose did not direct you what journal entries to make; did he?
' 
 
 A.
'No.
' 
 
 Q.
'To the extent relevant, it was you who decided, or your team, what journal entries should be made in relation to the general ledger; correct?
' 
 
 A.
'By and large, yes.
' 
 
 Q.
'Did you get Mr Rose's acquiescence to those or did you just make them of your own accord?
' 
 
 A.
'Various things would have been mentioned to him in passing.
The accounts would have been sent to him towards the end.
He would look at them and he would occasionally ask questions.
' 
 


 
111 Mr Harris' evidence in relation to the journal entry in respect of $1,198,969.72 included the following:
 
 
 Q.
' ... you can't tell the court, can you, what transactions that amount relates to, that is, the $1,198,969.72?
' 
 
 
 
 A.
'I don't recall.
I don't recall the make-up of that.
' 
 
 
 
 Q.
'You don't know, do you, whether that relates to any moneys borrowed by Mr Rose from the company, do you?
' 
 
 A.
'Well, I don't recall what that transaction is, so ...' 
 
 Q.
'You can't assist his Honour by saying whether that relates to any borrowings actually made by Mr Rose from the company, can you?
' 
 
 A.
'Well, I repeat what I said.
I don't recall the make-up of that transaction.
' 
 
 
 ... 
 
 
 Q.
'Can you tell me what the journal entry was that is posted here that entitled you or that provided the basis for the recognition by the company of an indebtedness ... by him of $1,198,000?
' 
 
 A.
'I don't recall.
I don't know off the top of my head.
' 
 ... 
 Q.
'To the extent that it's described as "take up balance of funds" it appears to be a balancing entry, doesn't it?
' 
 
 A.
'Yes.
' 
 
 Q.
'From what you've earlier told me, you would agree with me, wouldn't you, that that's a balancing entry that would have been made by your staff and was not something done at the direction of Mr Rose, correct?
' 
 
 A.
'I think that entry was made by my staff, yes.
' 
 ... 
 Q.
'... are you able to say what the take up balance of funds borrowed per LI refers in the accounts of the company?
' 
 
 A.
'I'm not sure ...
I believe that it may refer possibly to line of credit ... and I think what would've happened there we would've calculated the total loans and we'd need to balance them off with where the funds went or came from and we ended up with that figure.
' 
 ... 
 Q.
'... in relation to that entry you were asked questions about in respect of the $1,198,969.72 the position is you are not able to say whether that relates to any moneys that were actually borrowed from the company by Mr Rose; correct?
' 
 
 A.
'I don't recall exactly how that's made up.
That's the simple answer.
' 
 
 

112 In respect of an amount of $3,378,800, Mr Harris swore an affidavit on 28 August 2002 in proceeding number 4074 of 2002 in the Equity Division of the Supreme Court of New South Wales.
That affidavit included the following:
 
 '...
I have been informed by John Rose, the director of the Plaintiff [referring to Regis Towers] , and believe, that part but not all of the amounts shown as "Non Current Liabilities Unsecured Loans from other persons - $3,378,800" is in fact secured by mortgages over real estate.
Respectively, the borrowings making up that sum are as follows: 
 
 
 
 Permanent Trustee Australia $300,000 
 Sydney Wyde Mortgage Management $475,000 
 Belmore Investments Pty Limited $466,000 
 Meriton Apartments Pty Limited $270,300 
 Meriton Apartments Pty Limited $297,500 
 Meriton Apartments Pty Limited $455,000 
 Meriton Apartments Pty Limited $770,000 
 Wizard Home Loans $ 345,000 
 $3,378,800' 
 
 

113 In the said affidavit Mr Harris said:
 
 '...
I have been retained by John Rose as his accountant for a period in excess of 15 years, although I understand he has engaged other accountants for different purposes from time to time.
As a result of my professional relationship with Mr Rose, I have been involved in dealings with the plaintiff of which Mr Rose and his wife Popi Rose are the shareholders and Mr Rose the sole director.
I have been the accountant for the plaintiff since its incorporation in about April 1999 and have been responsible for the preparation of its financial statements from that time.
' 
 

114 The occasion for the preparation by Mr Harris of accounts for Regis Towers for the year ended 30 June 2000 in 2002 would appear to have been the need for him to swear the affidavit of 28 August 2002 in respect of an application for security for costs then made by the defendants in the Supreme Court proceedings namely Meriton Apartments Pty Limited, Meriton Finance Pty Limited and Harry Londy.
115 It is clear that the amount of $345,000 said to represent a borrowing by Regis Towers from Wizard Home Loans had nothing to do with Regis Towers.
116 The amount of $345,000 was borrowed by Mr and Mrs Pappas from Permanent Custodians Limited in its capacity as trustee for Wizard Home Loans on or about 7 May 2001.
Mr and Mrs Pappas on-lent the amount in question to the bankrupt, who used it to discharge his indebtedness to Patricia Dawn Grierson from whom the bankrupt had borrowed $327,000 on or about 12 May 2000 upon the security of a further third party mortgage given by Mr and Mrs Pappas over their property known as 14 Birchgrove Road, Balmain, which he then used to repay his original borrowing of $327,000 from Howes  Ors of 6 May 1999.
117 By a deed made 5 August 2002 between Mr and Mrs Pappas, Regis Towers and the bankrupt and his then wife Popi Rose, Regis Towers granted to Mr and Mrs Pappas a first fixed and floating charge over the whole business and assets of Regis Towers to secure repayment of an amount of $355,000 agreed to be lent by Mr and Mrs Pappas to Regis Towers, which the deed recorded as having already been advanced by Mr and Mrs Pappas to Regis Towers.
118 The deed provided for the bankrupt and Popi Rose to guarantee the repayment of the loan and any outstanding interest to Mr and Mrs Pappas.
119 As it transpires no such loan was ever made by Mr and Mrs Pappas to Regis Towers.
120 In these circumstances the Trustee responded to the Statement of Claim and Proxy Form claiming $483,970.21 lodged with him by Regis Towers by letter dated 29 March 2006 stating:
 
 ' Further Proof of Debt 
 
 You provided a CD containing copies of the company accounts in support of this claim.
My comments follow: 
 
 
 
 1.
The amount $483,970.21 claimed represents the balance of "Loans to directors" account in the company balance sheet as at 31 December 2003 under the heading "Receivables".
However, it does not reconcile with the company accounts.

 
 2.
Inspection of other items under the heading "Receivables" suggests that the amount is unreliable as most of these items are in fact liabilities , not debtors.

 
 3.
Mr Ben Wiles of your office represented that the company accounts were prepared by Harris Cottis whereas Harris Cottis categorically deny this.

 
 4.
According to Harris Cottis, the "Loans to directors" account recorded remuneration appropriated by both Mr and Mrs Rose, neither of whom was on a fixed salary package, pending its setoff against Mr Rose's accumulated tax losses.
