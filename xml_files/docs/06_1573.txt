 
1 The appellant appeals from a judgment of a Federal Magistrate in which his Honour dismissed an application for judicial review of a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal.
The Tribunal had rejected an application by the appellant to grant him a protection visa after an earlier adverse decision of a delegate of the Minister.
2 In his notice of appeal the appellant refers to the failure of the Tribunal to take into account evidence given by him to the Tribunal about his position as an activist in the Jatiya Party in Bangladesh.
3 Other grounds of appeal take issue with the ultimate finding of the Tribunal that the appellant does not have a well-founded fear of persecution for a Convention reason, its finding that the appellant did not give credible evidence and its rejection of his claims.
4 Each of the matters referred to in the preceding paragraph were matters which the appellant submits should have been corrected before the Court below.
5 It is not clear from the reasons of the Federal Magistrate that any of the above matters were raised before him.
Therefore, it is difficult to see how his Honour erred in his treatment of them.
In any event, each of them seeks to traverse matters of merit or take issue in an unparticularised way with the ultimate question of fact for the Tribunal, that is, does the appellant have a well-founded fear of persecution for a Convention reason.
6 The only issue of substance which the appellant raises on appeal is that contained in the first appeal ground.
The appellant contends that the Tribunal did not give him a reasonable opportunity to respond to independent evidence in its possession which supported the view that the appellant could return to Bangladesh without fear of persecution.
7 As the Tribunal's decision pre-dated the enactment of s 424A of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth), it is open to the appellant to submit that he was denied natural justice by not being given an opportunity to respond to the country information relied on by the Tribunal to reject his claim.
8 The Federal Magistrate dealt with and rejected the appellant's claim alleging a denial of procedural fairness.
His Honour held the relevant material was raised with the appellant during the Tribunal hearing.
He also held the material was the same information that was relied on by the delegate in his decision and notified to the appellant at that time.
9 In his decision the delegate said he considered certain documents, including some which would fit the description of 'independent evidence'.
