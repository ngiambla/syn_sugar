There is a trade mark which lies at the base of each claim.
It is the word "Colorado".
The mark was registered on 16 February 2001 in respect of, among other articles, "bags, wallets, purses and backpacks, belts," being goods in class 18 and in respect of "services for the bringing together, for the benefit of customers, of a variety of goods in the following classes ... [including] class 18 being bags, belts, wallets, purses and backpacks".
The infringement claim is brought under s 125 of the Trade Marks Act 1995 (Cth).
Relief is sought under s 126.
The principal defence is via a counterclaim seeking an order for the removal of the trade mark.
2 The first applicant, Colorado Group Limited (formerly known as Williams Shoes Limited), is a public company that has been listed on the Australian Stock Exchange since December 1999.
Before its listing Colorado Group was a subsidiary of Venator Group, Inc (formerly known as Woolworth Corporation) a large and well-known New York corporation.
Initially, Colorado Group did not carry on any trade in its own right.
Its principal businesses "Williams the Shoemen" and "Mathers for Shoes" (obviously footwear retailing businesses) were conducted through subsidiaries, the second applicant, Williams the Shoemen Pty Limited, and Mathers Shoes Pty Limited, respectively.
In 1991 the group was restructured and the footwear businesses transferred to Colorado Group.
3 At the present time Colorado Group (by which appellation I include Williams the Shoemen) operates in Australia a chain of retail stores.
It has 165 Williams the Shoemen stores, 96 Mathers for Shoes stores, 28 JAG stores (which sell men's and women's clothing and fashion accessories), 10 Diana Ferrari stores (which sell women's footwear and leather goods) and 82 Colorado stores.
The Colorado stores sell clothing, accessories and footwear.
Ms Hudson, the general manager of the Colorado division, said that when they were established, the idea was that Colorado stores would market their products with "strong reference to [an] outdoors, rugged lifestyle".
Now, as a result of Ms Hudson's initiative, Colorado is a "lifestyle" brand, "offering smart, casual, integrated looks that connote or evoke a quintessentially 'Australian casual' look and feel.
" 
 
4 It is necessary to know something about the history of the applicants and how they came to market goods bearing the mark "Colorado".
In 1982 there were approximately 140 Williams the Shoemen stores around Australia.
In addition to selling shoes another product sold in those stores was a style of backpack with the word "Colorado" embroidered on the front.
The word "Colorado" may have appeared in conjunction with a logo comprising a "simple mountain motif".
The logo was certainly applied to backpacks from 1988.
The backpacks were sold for use predominantly by schoolchildren and hence marketed as a "back to school" product.
Although the backpacks were sold throughout Australia, the product was most successful in north Queensland.
5 Beginning in 1987 the Colorado mark was also applied to shoes.
Mr Williams, who was with the Colorado Group during the 1980s, said that initially the word was used in conjunction with the "simple mountain motif": both marks appearing on the sock of the shoe.
The word also appeared by itself on the outside of the shoe near the heel.
6 In 1988 Mr Williams began working with others on the development of a three peaked mountain logo for use in conjunction with the word "Colorado".
The logo took its final form by 1991.
Thereafter the mountain logo was displayed on "Colorado" shoes on the inner sole, the bottom of the sole and on the outside of the upper of the shoes.
7 Although new to Australia in 1982, the Colorado mark was not a new mark.
Mr Williams described it as a "generic name" used by the parent company (Woolworths Corporation) on goods marketed in the United States.
In describing the mark as a "generic name" Mr Williams meant that it was an "in-house" brand name used by Woolworths as a trade mark for its own products.
Footlocker and Lynx are examples of other "generic names" used by Woolworths Corporation.
Goods bearing the Colorado mark (backpacks and shoes) were acquired for sale through the agency of Woolworths Overseas Corporation, which, I assume, was another Woolworths subsidiary.
That company arranged for the manufacture of merchandise bearing "generic names".
Representatives of the Australian subsidiary, and presumably also of subsidiaries in other countries, visited WOC's offices where sample goods were available for inspection.
If a subsidiary wished to purchase any of those goods the order for their manufacture would be placed by WOC, which was also responsible for quality control and ensuring that the goods met the local company's specifications.
It is not clear when this arrangement came to an end for the Australian subsidiary, but most likely it lasted until shortly before the listing of Colorado Group.
8 The volume of Colorado backpacks sold through Williams the Shoemen stores was relatively modest.
On the other hand, some considerable success was being achieved with the sale of Colorado shoes through both Williams the Shoemen and Mathers stores, especially as the range available increased and the quality improved.
While detailed accounting records are no longer available it is estimated that in 1990 around $8 million worth of Colorado branded products was sold by the two stores.
9 The success of Colorado branded shoes led the then retail director, Mr Beagley, to come up with the idea of expanding the Colorado range to include clothing and accessories and establishing a chain of "Colorado" stores to sell those products.
As a preliminary step an advertising agency was retained to work on the proposal with Mr Beagley.
Together they produced a report in late 1992.
The "Key Research Findings" in the report were:
 
 "The store concept was wholeheartedly endorsed by both lower and middle-upper income groups.
Significantly, the store concept was able to achieve interest amongst lower-income males who generally had little interest in both shopping and clothes.

 ... 
 The mountain graphic was a real winner and is seen to be representative of Colorado.
It should be maximised in store.
Despite being easily identified, it should not replace the door as it is not dramatic enough.
It is graphically strong and contemporary but would soon become on [sic] of the crowd.
" 
 

According to the report: 
 
 "Colorado has been chosen as it has lifestyle connotations that are representative of to [sic] the brand.
Within Australia the Colorado name has very strong attributes that make it the ideal promotional platform.

 
 The chain will gain instant brand value from the rich cultural and geographical images that Colorado evokes.
