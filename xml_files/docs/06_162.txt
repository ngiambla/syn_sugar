By that decision, the Tribunal affirmed a decision of a delegate of the respondent Minister refusing to grant the appellant a protection visa.
2 The appellant is an Ismaili (Shia) Muslim, and a national of India.
He formerly lived in Bombay (Mumbai).
He arrived in Australia on 13 August 2001 on a visitor visa valid for three months.
In his application for that visa he stated that he wanted to visit Australia on a "honeymoon tour".
He claimed that he was the proprietor of a business known as "the Shoe Palace", and that he had worked there for some nine years.
3 On 25 September 2001, the appellant lodged an application for a protection visa.
On 14 February 2002, that application was rejected by the Minister's delegate.
On 5 March 2002, the appellant applied to the Tribunal for review of the delegate's decision.
In a written statement to the Tribunal he claimed that he had joined the Muslim League in 1996, and that he had been appointed a senior member of his branch in 1998.
He had earlier stated at an interview before the delegate that he had joined "the social wing" of the Muslim League as it was supportive of fellow Muslims and provided money for children to attend school and for orphan girls to marry.
He had said that the social group "was not involved in politics", and that its members were not involved in demonstrations, disruption of Hindu events, or any violence.
4 The appellant recounted a series of incidents whereby he and other Muslims had been attacked by Hindus.
He claimed that after one such incident he had been hospitalised with severe injuries.
However, rather than arresting those responsible, the police had taken him into custody, and threatened him with torture if he did not sign a false statement admitting that he had been responsible for attacks upon Hindus.
He said that he had spent some time in prison before his parents paid a large bribe to have him released.
5 The appellant claimed he was again arrested after he returned home, this time while staying at his uncle's house in Surat.
On this occasion, the police told him that he was to be charged with "supplying illegal weapons to Muslims".
He claimed that the police tortured him, but allowed him to contact his solicitor the following morning.
His solicitor then arranged for his release on bail "after paying the police an enormous bribe".
6 The appellant said he then fled to Bangalore.
He remained there for some eight or nine months until he was apprehended.
He was imprisoned, and a further bribe paid for his release.
He was told by the Chief Inspector of the Crime Branch of the New Delhi Branch of the Indian Intelligence Service that this was the last time that he would be released from custody, and warned that he should leave India as soon as possible.
7 The appellant claimed that for the next six months he went to stay with a friend in Pune, near Bombay.
In October 2000, he was again intercepted by the Chief Inspector who asked him why he had not left India.
The appellant said that he could not afford to do so.
The Chief Inspector, who was a Muslim, again warned the appellant that he should leave India.
The appellant did so, on 12 August 2001, using a legitimate passport.
He claimed that he had bribed relevant officials to enable him to leave the country.
8 On 30 June 2003, the Tribunal affirmed the decision not to grant the appellant a protection visa.
In its findings, it concluded that the appellant was an untruthful witness whose evidence had been "inconsistent, rehearsed and far-fetched in significant respects".
The Tribunal said that the appellant's evidence that he feared persecution for religious reasons was inconsistent with authoritative reports that religious groups in Maharashtra (the State in which Mumbai is located) generally have amicable relations, and that the government of that State does not discriminate against Hindus or Muslims.
9 The Tribunal found that the appellant's account of his movements contained a number of inconsistencies, and that he was confused about certain quite fundamental matters.
Yet he appeared to have a precise recollection of the amount of time that he had spent in hospital and in prison.
He also had little difficulty recalling exactly how long he had resided in different parts of India.
In the Tribunal's view, there was a striking correlation between what the appellant could recall with precision, and what was contained in his written statement.
It was on that basis that the Tribunal found that the appellant's evidence had been "rehearsed".
The Tribunal also regarded it as significant that the appellant could not account for the period of six months immediately preceding his departure from India.
Indeed, he had said nothing about that period in his initial interview, or in his written statement to the Tribunal.
10 The Tribunal found that the appellant's attitude towards obtaining corroborative material to support his claims was "perverse".
When first asked about the documents that ostensibly supported his claim to have arranged for bribes to be paid through his lawyer, the appellant said that he could obtain those documents, and that they would "prove" his case.
When the matter next came before the Tribunal, at the second hearing of his claim, the appellant stated that his lawyer had "disappeared" from Mumbai, and that the documents were therefore unavailable.
The Tribunal rejected his application for a further adjournment, and described his evidence on this point as "thoroughly unconvincing".
11 In summary, the Tribunal found the appellant's evidence to be far-fetched, and unconvincing in relation to the series of bribes that he claimed to have paid to the Indian authorities, and in relation to his supposed encounters with the Chief Inspector.
It therefore did not accept that he had been mistreated by those authorities, or that they had charged him with any criminal offence for religious reasons, or any other Refugees Convention reason, or that he had experienced any persecution by Hindus in India by reason of being a Muslim.
12 Phipps FM dismissed the appellant's application for judicial review on the basis that no jurisdictional error had been demonstrated.
In his Honour's view, the appellant had simply invited the Federal Magistrates Court to engage in merits review.
13 The appellant was not legally represented in the appeal to this Court.
His notice of appeal does not identify any grounds of appeal.
His written contentions are difficult to follow, although his oral submissions were somewhat clearer.
