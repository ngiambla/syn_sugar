 
1 In this appeal from a decision of the Commissioner of Patents (by her delegate the Deputy Commissioner of Patents) to amend entries in the Register of Patents, Spirit Pharmaceuticals Pty Ltd ('Spirit') seeks to be joined as a respondent pursuant to Order 6 rules 2(a) and (b) and O 6 r 8(1) of the Federal Court Rules ('the Rules').
In the alternative to the order for joinder, Spirit seeks an order that it be granted leave to intervene in the proceedings pursuant to O 6 r 17 or, alternatively, to appear in the proceedings as amicus curiae .
2 The effect of the Commissioner's decision is that the Register will be amended to record the term of Pfizer's Patent No 540769 as expiring on 14 April 2007, rather than 26 February 2008, as is presently recorded on the Register.
While three other patents are also the subject of the Commissioner's decision, only Patent No 540769 ('the patent') is of interest to Spirit.
If Pfizer's appeal is successful, the amendment to the patent will not be made.
Accordingly, the effect of the relief sought by Pfizer in these proceedings is that the Register will record the term of the patent as expiring more than 10 months later than would otherwise be the case.
3 Spirit's application for joinder is opposed by Pfizer and supported by the Commissioner.
4 Spirit had sought leave to appear and make submissions at the hearing before the Deputy Commissioner.
Leave was refused on the ground, inter alia , that there was no basis under the Patents Act 1990 (Cth) ('the Act') or the Patent Regulations 1991 (Cth) ('the Regulations') for such an appearance.
In contrast to the Commissioner, whose powers are governed by the Act and the Regulations, the Court has broad powers under the Rules to permit the joinder of parties to proceedings where appropriate.
5 Order 6 of the Rules deals with the addition of parties.
Order 6 rule 2 provides:
 
 'Two or more persons may be joined as applicants or respondents in any proceeding: 
 
 
 
 (a) Where 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (i) if a separate proceeding were brought by or against each of them, as the case may be, some common question of law or of fact would arise in all the proceedings; and 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (ii) all rights to relief claimed in the proceeding (whether they are joint, several or alternative) are in respect of or arise out of the same transaction or series of transactions; or 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (b) where the Court gives leave so to do.
