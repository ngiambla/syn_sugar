 
1 Eric Byrne served in the Australian Army between April 1942 and February 1946.
His service was "operational service" within the meaning of the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 (Cth) ('the Act') and his widow applied for a war widow's pension pursuant to s 14 of the Act.
Mr Byrne died in November 1962 when his boat overturned during a fishing trip on Tantangara Dam in the Snowy Mountains.
2 A coronial inquiry found that Mr Byrne had died in a ' tragic accident ' and that the cause of his death was drowning.
That conclusion was adopted by the Repatriation Commission, which refused Mrs Byrne's claim for a pension, upon being satisfied that the veteran's death was not service related.
The Veterans' Review Board affirmed the Commission's decision, which was later affirmed by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal ( Byrne v Repatriation Commission [2006] AATA 416).
Mrs Byrne appeals the Tribunal's decision.
3 Mrs Byrne put to the Tribunal that her husband suffered from ischaemic heart disease ('IHD') and coronary artery disease ('CAD'), each said to be war-caused conditions.
It was accepted by the Tribunal that Mr Byrne did suffer from CAD (at [66]).
The issue in this appeal concerns the Tribunal's finding that it was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that CAD was not a contributing factor to the death of Mr Byrne by drowning.
Two grounds of appeal are pressed.
The Tribunal's finding that it was not satisfied that Mr Byrne suffered from IHD is not challenged and those parts of the notice of appeal which refer to IHD are not pressed.
It is convenient to deal with the second ground of appeal first.
The application of the correct test 
 
 4 Mrs Byrne relevantly posited to the Tribunal that her husband's ability to survive in the waters of Tantangara Dam when his boat overturned was impaired by war-caused CAD.
The Tribunal accepted that hypothesis to be reasonable (at [89]).
