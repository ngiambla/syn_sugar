 INTRODUCTION 
 
1 In this proceeding, on 8 August 2005 Colin Nicol was appointed Receiver and Manager of all the property of Guiseppe Antonio Mercorella (with one exception), and the property of the unregistered managed investment scheme operated by Mr Mercorella (the Scheme) as well as liquidator of the scheme.
On 29 September 2005, he was also appointed as liquidator of the corporate entities which were parties to the Scheme.
On 3 August 2006 Samuel Davies was appointed jointly with Mr Nicol as Receiver and Manager of the property of Mr Mercorella and the property of the Scheme, and as liquidator of the Scheme and as liquidator of the Scheme companies.
2 At the time of the initial order, on 8 August 2005, Mr Mercorella was the registered proprietor of property at 22-32 Jerningham Street, North Adelaide (the Jerningham Street property).
The Jerningham Street property was subject to a first registered mortgage in favour of Banksia Mortgages Ltd (Banksia), produced on 30 June 2004 and registered on 15 July 2004.
3 On 19 July 2005 Anthony John Sobey produced, and subsequently had registered on 22 July 2005, a caveat over the Jerningham Street property.
The caveat asserted a beneficial interest 
 
 "... as mortgagee of [the Jerningham Street property] pursuant to a loan agreement dated the 19 th day of July 2005 between the caveator and caveatee wherein pursuant to clause 5 of the loan agreement the caveatee expressly mortgaged to the caveator the estate and interest in the land" (the Sobey caveat).


4 Subsequent to the order of 8 August 2005, a company ACN 114 377 592 Pty Ltd (ACN 114) also produced for registration a caveat on 31 August 2005 in respect of the Jerningham Street property which was registered on 6 September 2005.
I do not need to refer in detail to the ACN 114 caveat, because its solicitors by letter of 3 April 2006 have indicated that it has no ongoing claim in respect of the land that is the Jerningham Street property or the proceeds of its sale.
5 On 10 August 2005, the Court made orders on the application of Mr Nicol inter alia pursuant to s 64 of the Real Property Act 1886 (SA) directing the Registrar General to enter that order on certain certificates of title, including over the Jerningham Street property, and not to register any further dealing with such property until further order.
On 9 September 2005, Banksia served on Mr Mercorella a notice of demand for payment and observance of the terms of its mortgage.
Mr Mercorella was in default of the terms of the Banksia mortgage.
Banksia and Mr Nicol agreed to a variation of the orders made on 10 August 2005 to permit Banksia to realise its security, on the basis that any funds available after payment of Banksia's debt secured by its mortgage, and after payment of the expenses of preserving and realising the asset, were to be paid into the Minter Ellison Trust Account until further order, and in particular pending Mr Nicol's investigation of any competing claims in relation to those surplus funds.
The Court on 14 October 2005 directed the Registrar General to give effect to that arrangement by making such entries as necessary to permit Banksia to effect its power of sale as mortgagee pursuant to the Banksia mortgage in respect of the Jerningham Street property.
6 The Jerningham Street property was then sold by Banksia by way of public auction on 16 December 2005.
The sale price was $2,511,000.
Settlement was effected on 16 February 2006.
After payment of the expenses of realisation and in preserving the property, and after the discharge the of Banksia mortgage, the surplus funds paid into the Minter Ellison Trust Account from the proceeds of sale of the Jerningham Street property totalled $1,352,810.
Those sums were then duly invested in an interest bearing account.
There is a sum in excess of $1.4 million presently held in that account.
THE ISSUE 
 
7 The issue in this proceeding is the extent to which, if at all, Mr Sobey is entitled to participate in the distribution of those surplus funds.
THE PRESENT APPLICATION 
 
8 By motion of 23 August 2006, Mr Nicol and Mr Davies applied for an order that the full amount of the surplus funds be paid to them in their capacity as joint receivers and managers of the property of Mr Mercorella and the Scheme, and as joint liquidators of the Scheme and the Scheme companies.
They contend they are the relevant parties entitled to receive such moneys.
9 The only competing claimant to those funds, following the intimation that the interest asserted in the ACN 114 caveat is not being pursued, is Mr Sobey.
10 The proceedings are properly instituted as an interlocutory application in the principal proceedings by notice of motion, pursuant to r 2.2(1) of the Federal Court (Corporations) Rules 2000 .
Although the proceeding in its current form is by interlocutory application, it is in fact seeking final relief in respect of the administration of certain of the property of Mr Mercorella, namely the proceeds of sale of the Jerningham Street property.
THE CLAIM BY MR SOBEY 
 
11 The assertion of the Sobey claim by Mr Sobey has been a long time coming.
12 By letter from Mr Sobey's solicitors of 13 December 2005, Mr Sobey's interest was asserted in the following terms:
 
 "Our client has an interest in [the Jerningham Street property] by way of an equitable mortgage.
This mortgage secures the sum of $750,000 lent by our client to Mr Guiseppe Mercorella.
The amount secured by the mortgage is pursuant to two separate loan agreements, dated 16 March 2004 in the sum of $350,000 and $400,000 dated 20 April 2004.
Interest on these loans is 32% per annum pursuant to cl 4 of the loan agreements.
Our client registered a caveat over the various titles of this property, giving notice of his interest.
We enclose copies of the mortgage and loan agreements referred to above.
"
 

13 The enclosed documents included a two page memorandum of mortgage dated 19 July 2005 apparently signed by Mr Mercorella but not signed by or on behalf of Mr Sobey.
It is not stamped.
It identifies the consideration for the mortgage as being the advance of $750,000 made up of two advances of $350,000 on 16 March 2004 and of $400,000 on 20 April 2004, to be repaid by interest only repayments of $20,000 per month, and the capital to be repayable on one month's written notice.
The commencement day was 16 March 2004.
14 The enclosed loan agreement is undated.
It is apparently signed by Mr Mercorella, but not by Mr Sobey.
It too asserts that Mr Sobey has advanced to Mr Mercorella $750,000 in the two tranches referred to and that the parties are desirous of setting out the terms and conditions of the loan agreement.
Although the recitals record that Mr Mercorella acknowledges that, by virtue of the execution of the agreement, he expressly mortgages something, there is no expression of what is mortgaged.
The relevant space is left blank.
It is obviously a draft document.
Elsewhere it records that the parties, in consideration of the loan, have mortgaged the Jerningham Street property.
It provides for interest repayments in the same terms as mentioned, being at 32 per cent per annum.
15 Although the letter of 13 December 2005 refers to enclosed copies of the mortgage and loan agreements, only one loan agreement was included.
16 That letter also asserted that Mr Sobey had instructed his solicitors to apply for the balance of the funds obtained by sale of the Jerningham Street property, and then held in the Minter Ellison Trust Account, to be paid to Mr Sobey pursuant to his equitable interest in the Jerningham Street property.
An enclosed proposed application and supporting affidavit was also included with that letter.
The draft application sought an order that the purchase money arising from the mortgagee sale by Banksia be applied, after the expenses of sale and the payment to Banksia to discharge its mortgage, to the trust account of Mr Sobey's solicitors for Mr Sobey, and for the balance, if any, thereafter be paid to the trust account of Minter Ellison.
There was a brief draft affidavit of Mr Sobey, unsigned of course, asserting the two advances, that Mr Mercorella could not service the loan repayments, and that therefore on 19 July 2005 Mr Mercorella mortgaged the Jerningham Street property in favour of Mr Sobey to secure the advances and the accrued interest.
It asserted that Mr Sobey had a valid equitable mortgage over the property, protected by his caveat, and that he claimed to be entitled to the surplus of the funds at the sale of the property of $750,000 plus interest pursuant to the mortgage and the loan agreement.
17 Earlier, on 12 August 2005, the solicitors for Mr Nicol requested Mr Sobey to provide them with a copy of the loan agreement dated 19 July 2005 referred to in the caveat and of details of the advances made pursuant to the loan agreement, and of the balance currently payable under that agreement.
They sent a follow-up letter on 22 August 2005.
The then solicitors for Mr Sobey responded by letter of 8 September 2005 enclosing copy cheques indicating two payments of money to Mr Mercorella, and asserting the existence of "an unregistered mortgage which had been executed prior to the Federal Court injunction".
The two enclosed copy cheques were dated 16 March 2004 and 20 April 2004 in the sums of $350,000 and $400,000 respectively, apparently drawn on Mr Sobey's account.
18 On 20 September 2005, the solicitors for Mr Nicol repeated the request for a copy of the loan agreement and details of the balance currently payable under that agreement, and requested a copy of the unregistered mortgage.
19 The next communication, at least on the evidence, appears to be the letter from the current solicitors for Mr Sobey to solicitors for Mr Nicol dated 13 December 2005.
The solicitors for Mr Nicol replied the following day.
They pointed out that it had taken some time for a copy of the mortgage and loan agreement to be provided, and that those documents had not been provided in response to a summons for examination served upon Mr Sobey when he attended in Court for examination on 24 November 2004.
They also pointed out that there was still no evidence of the amounts allegedly lent to Mr Mercorella, or of the balance currently payable.
It referred to the examination of Mr Sobey to take place on 22 December 2005 and that he would be required to produce documentation relating to his claims and to be examined on them.
20 The following day, the solicitors for Mr Sobey responded.
They re-asserted the urgency in the matter, because Mr Sobey, as a secured creditor, had been deprived of any interest income generated from the loans because the proceeds of sale were to be paid to the Minter Ellison Trust Account.
Those solicitors said that they had only been made aware of the mortgage and the loan agreement (provided with their letter of 13 December 2005) when recently provided with a copy of those documents by the former solicitors for Mr Sobey.
They indicated that they were instructed to file and serve the proposed application promptly.
21 Mr Sobey's examination took place on 22 December 2005 and was then adjourned.
As a result of that examination, a request was made by Mr Nicol's solicitors for bank statements relevant to the loan documentation, loan documentation setting out the terms of the advances together with the alleged sales agreement between the parties as deposed to by Mr Sobey, and banking records setting out the receipt of payments by Mr Sobey or entities associated with him of the interest of $20,000 per month in respect of the advances.
They indicated that an application would be made to the Court if that material was not provided.
22 On 29 January 2006 Mr Sobey's solicitors responded to that letter asserting that Mr Sobey did not retain any documents in his possession, and enclosing correspondence they had sent to previous firms of solicitors acting for Mr Sobey and his accountants, requesting such information as was available.
They subsequently wrote to Mr Nicol's solicitors again on 15 February 2006, repeating the assertion about the loans, and the mortgage, and querying whether Mr Nicol was asserting anything other than that he needed to be satisfied as to the actual amounts outstanding to Mr Sobey.
They indicated that Mr Sobey's accountant had been requested to provide the appropriate schedule of payments and supporting documentation.
They also said that Mr Sobey's accountant had said that that material had been produced to the Court pursuant to a summons to the accountant, including the original bank statements.
They re-asserted the instruction to make an application to the Court promptly.
A further letter 21 February 2006 requested an urgent reply.
23 The correspondence then generally dealt with the circumstances in which the surplus funds for the sale of the Jerningham Street property came to be paid to the Minter Ellison Trust Account.
24 By letter of 28 February 2006 the solicitors for Mr Nicol asserted that it was for Mr Sobey to establish his entitlement to all or part of those surplus proceeds, in particular, by establishing the existence of a valid security.
