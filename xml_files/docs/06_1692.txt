 
1 The applicant, acting on behalf of the Mutitjulu Community Aboriginal Corporation ('Mutitjulu'), seeks a review of the decision of the first respondent ('the Registrar') made on 18 July 2006 to appoint the second respondent as Administrator ('the Administrator') to Mutitjulu pursuant to s 71(2) of the Aboriginal Councils and Associations Act 1976 (Cth) ('the ACA Act').
Such application is made under s 5 of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 (Cth) ('the ADJR Act'), and s 39B of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth).
ESSENTIAL FACTS 
 Structure of Mutitjulu 
 
2 Mutitjulu is an Aboriginal association incorporated on 3 February 2006 pursuant to Part IV of the ACA Act.
The business of Mutitjulu is the administration of the supply of essential services to the Mutitjulu Aboriginal Community located in the Northern Territory of Australia.
Such services include employment, health and housing, youth care, after school care and anti substance abuse programs.
3 The operation of the Mutitjulu Community is dependent upon financial assistance of the Commonwealth of Australia which is provided with the approval of the Commonwealth Department of Families and Community Services and Indigenous Affairs ('FaCSIA').
4 Part II of the ACA Act makes provision for a Registrar of Aboriginal Corporations.
The power of the Registrar and the functions thereof are contained in s 5 of the ACA Act and include the power to act as agent for an Aboriginal corporation: see s 5(2).
Section 43 of the ACA Act provides for the creation of a Board of an Aboriginal Corporation ('Governing Committee').
5 Section 71(1) of the ACA Act provides that if the Registrar considers that there may be grounds for appointing an administrator, the Registrar may serve upon the public officer of the corporation a notice in writing:
 
 '...calling upon the corporation to show cause, within a reasonable period specified in the notice, why an Administrator should not be appointed.
' 
 An administrator may be appointed if the Registrar is satisfied that such appointment is required ' in the public interest' (s 71(2)(f)).
Cessation of funding by FaCSIA to Mutitjulu 
 
6 On 30 June 2006 FaCSIA notified the Registrar that funding to Mutitjulu would cease from 1 July 2006 and requested the Registrar to appoint an administrator.
Such notification resulted from irregularities which FaCSIA believed existed in the operations of Mutitjulu as discussed hereunder.
7 By email on 4 July 2006 addressed to the Registrar, FaCSIA confirmed the cessation of funding and on 5 July 2006 a meeting took place attended by representatives of Mutitjulu and other interested parties.
A further meeting was held on 10 July 2006.
The Registrar was kept fully informed of the correspondence and meetings between FaCSIA and Mutitjulu.
However on 10 July 2006 FaCSIA again confirmed that funding to the community would not be resumed unless an administrator were appointed.
8 On 11 July 2006 the Registrar wrote to Mutitjulu enclosing a notice issued pursuant to s 71 of the ACA Act ('the Notice'), requiring Mutitjulu to show cause by close of business on 12 July 2006 why an administrator should not be appointed.
The letter invited Mutitjulu to telephone a toll free number if discussion was required.
The Notice contained details of the grounds upon which the Registrar relied and relevantly stated as follows:
 
 'The grounds which I consider may exist are that the appointment of an administrator is required in the interest of members and creditors of the Corporation and in the public interest.
