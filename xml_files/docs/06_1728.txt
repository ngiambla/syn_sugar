 
1 Mrs McGuiness retained the respondent solicitors ('Keddies') to act for her in a personal injuries action in the District Court of New South Wales against the Roads and Traffic Authority ('RTA').
The retainer was based on a conditional costs agreement ("no win, no fee").
She obtained a verdict of approximately $600,000 in damages, stayed pending any appeal.
A condition of the stay was that Mrs McGuiness receive a part payment of $300,000.
Keddies received $270,000 of that amount into their trust account, which they disbursed with the authority of Mrs McGuiness.
The RTA later appealed to the Court of Appeal and was successful.
Mrs McGuiness' estate (Mrs McGuiness having died) was ordered to repay the $300,000 but was unable to do so.
These proceedings are brought by the trustee of her estate, Mr Woodgate, for moneys had and received.
Mr Woodgate seeks an order that Keddies pay him $243,971.87, the moneys disbursed by Keddies in payment of their fees and third party expenses.
2 It is not in dispute that, at the time that the moneys were paid to Keddies after the verdict in the District Court and before the appeal was filed or determined, Mrs McGuiness was obliged to pay those costs and disbursements and Keddies were entitled to the money.
Mrs McGuiness authorised the payment.
There is no suggestion that the transaction pursuant to that authorisation is void at the suit of Mr Woodgate or of any creditor.
Mr Woodgate submits, however, that Mrs McGuiness' obligation to pay costs and disbursements ended when the District Court judgment was set aside.
On this basis, he submits that Keddies are now obliged to make repayment of the moneys disbursed.
3 The RTA is not a party and these proceedings do not concern any claim by it for restitution of moneys paid pursuant to a verdict later set aside.
