 
1 Tasmania is an island of unparalleled beauty.
It contains wild and picturesque landscapes.
Among those landscapes is the Wielangta forest.
Wielangta means 'tall forest' in the language of the 'Palawa', the indigenous people of Tasmania.
2 Wielangta is about 50 kilometres north-east of Hobart, near the towns of Orford and Copping.
The forest consists of two principal types of eucalypt --- dry and wet sclerophyll.
It is home to, or used by, a variety of species of wildlife, including the swift parrot, the broad-toothed stag beetle and the Tasmanian wedge-tailed eagle.
3 The applicant, Senator Robert Brown, commenced this proceeding under s 475 of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (Cth) ('EPBC Act').
He seeks an injunction to restrain the respondent, Forestry Tasmania, from undertaking any forestry operations, or any activities in connection with forestry operations, in the Wielangta forest.
