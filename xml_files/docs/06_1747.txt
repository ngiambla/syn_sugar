 
1 This proceeding concerns the proper construction of s 41(2) of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth) ('the AAT Act') in the context of a review by the third respondent, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal ('the Tribunal'), of a decision of the first respondent, the Companies Auditors Liquidators Disciplinary Board ('the Board'), under the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) ('the Corporations Act ') Under s 41(2), the Tribunal may, on request by a party to a proceeding before the Tribunal, make such order or orders ' staying or otherwise affecting the operation or implementation of the decision to which the relevant proceeding relates... as the Tribunal considers appropriate for the purpose of securing the effectiveness of the hearing and a determination of the application for review '.
2 Section 1292(2)(d)(ii) of the Corporations Act relevantly provides that the Board may, if it is satisfied that a person who is registered as a liquidator under the Corporations Act has failed to carry out or perform adequately and properly certain duties, by order, suspend for a specified period the registration of that person as a liquidator.
Under s 1296(1) , where the Board decides to exercise that power in relation to a person, the Board must, within 14 days after the decision:
 
 
 a) give to the person a notice in writing setting out the decision and the reasons for it; and
 b) lodge a copy of that notice with the second respondent, Australian Securities and Investments Commission ('ASIC'); and
 c) cause to be published in the Gazette a notice in writing setting out the decision.

 

3 The applicant is registered as a liquidator under the Corporations Act .
On, or possibly before, 20 November 2006, the Board decided to exercise the powers in s 1292(2).
On that day, it made orders that registration of the applicant as a liquidator be suspended for a period of three months, commencing 60 days after the order takes effect.
The form of the order is somewhat curious.
It may be that the Board was intending to exercise the power conferred by s 1297 of the Corporations Act .
Under s 1297(1) , an order made by the Board suspending the registration of a person as a liquidator comes into effect at the end of the day on which there is given to the person a notice of the kind referred to in s 1296(1).
However, under s 1297(2) , where the Board makes such an order, it may, in order to enable an application to be made to the Tribunal for review of the decision to make the order, determine that the order is not to come into effect until a specified time or until the happening of a specified event.
It may be that the Board intended to make a determination that its order for suspension of the registration of the applicant as a liquidator not come into effect for the period of 60 days after the order was made.
However, that is not what the Board did.
In any event, that curiosity does not appear to be relevant to the issue presently before the Court.
4 Section s 1317B(1) of the Corporations Act provides that an application may be made to the Tribunal for review of a decision made under the Corporations Act by the Board.
On 30 November 2006, the applicant filed an application to the Tribunal for review of the Board's decision to exercise its powers under s 1292(2).
