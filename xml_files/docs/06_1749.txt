 
1 This is an appeal from a decision of a federal magistrate refusing an application for review of a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal (the "Tribunal").
The facts are set out in the magistrate's reasons as follows:
 
 
 '4.
...
The (appellant) claims to be a citizen of the Philippines and arrived in Australia on 9 November 2004.
On the same date, she lodged an application for a protection (Class XA) visa with the Department of Immigration.
On 13 December 2004, a delegate of the Minister refused to grant a protection visa and on 11 January 2005 the (appellant) applied to the Tribunal for review of the delegate's decision.

 
 5.
According to the (appellant's) protection visa application, she was born in Tobod, the Philippines, and lived at an address near Lala (Lanao del Norte Province, Northern Mindanao) for at least ten years prior to her departure for Australia.
She is a Christian of Basia ethnicity.
She married in 1993, and her husband and four children remain in the Philippines.
The (appellant) obtained a Bachelor of Science degree and a teaching qualification in 1995, and was employed as a high school teacher.

 
 6.
The (appellant's) claims for protection are contained in her answer to question 40 of the visa application.
She claims her father owns some 25 acres of farming land in the Tobod area.
She has ten siblings, some who work in agriculture and others in business.
The Moro Islamic Liberation Front ("MILF") is active in the (appellant's) province demanding money from the (appellant's) family.
The family guarded their property and initially made some payments to the MILF.
However, the MILF then demanded larger sums, threatened to kill family members and take over their property if the (appellant) did not pay.
They also demanded a portion of the (appellant's) salary as a teacher.
The (appellant) left the Philippines because she was scared.
' 
 
 
 

2 The appellant, at her husband's suggestion, initially went to the United Arab Emirates but later decided that Australia was a safer place for her family.
She could initially afford to pay only for her own travel.
She hopes to bring her entire family to Australia.
The Tribunal rejected her application for a protection visa.
Counsel for the respondent provided the magistrate with the following summary of the Tribunal's reasons:
 
 '6.
The Tribunal - 
 
 
 
 
 (a) Accepted that the (appellant) is a national of the Philippines for the purposes of her application ...; 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (b) Accepted that the (appellant) (like the majority of her compatriots and the Philippine authorities) is opposed to the aims and extortionary taxes imposed by the Islamic rebels and that the (appellant) has concerns for the economic and social well being of her country and her children because of the rebels' actions ...; 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (c) Was not satisfied that the (appellant's) account of the (influence of) Muslims in her province and the impact of the rebels is accurate ...; 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (d) Accepted as plausible that the (appellant's) family had been paying the revolutionary tax imposed by the rebels and that the (appellant) had counselled her family against doing so but they had ignored her advice ...; 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (e) Was not satisfied that the (appellant) had ever come to the adverse attention of the rebels as a result of her disapproval of the tax because: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (i) The evidence provided to substantiate the claim was confined to her oral statements to the Tribunal which were unable to be corroborated because the (appellant) had only ever shared them with her family ...; 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (ii) The (appellant) had not confided in anyone else including her church groups and had not taken any steps to sound out whether local teachers such as herself had been targeted similarly.
Rather the only persons she had told were directly involved in her present visa application ...; 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (iii) The (appellant) does not have any profile which would make her an attractive target for the rebels ...; 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (iv) The Tribunal could not be satisfied that the rebels had in fact threatened the (appellant) verbally or by loitering around her home and had not appeared to have been aware of her absence from the Philippines in early 2004.
The (appellant) claimed in her protection visa to have escaped without the rebels noticing.
Also there was no evidence that following the (appellant's) return from Dubai the alleged extortion menacing activities had continued ...; 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (v) The conduct of the (appellant) of returning from the United Arab Emirates to the Philippines is not consistent with a person fleeing persecution ...; 
 
 
 
 
 (f) Found that the (appellant) had been the subject of past adverse attention from rebels in her home town for refusing to pay the revolutionary tax or for any other reason.
Having found that the (appellant) has not been subject to past persecution the Tribunal had no evidence before it to indicate that the (appellant) held a well-founded fear of persecution from the rebels or other sources for any reason ... .
(Clearly, the word "not" has been omitted between the words 'had' and 'been' in the first sentence.
)
 
 (g) Went on to consider even if this were not the case whether the (appellant) might reasonably relocate from her home town to elsewhere in the Philippines to specifically avoid the rebels in question.
The Tribunal concluded that relocation was a reasonable possibility for the applicant.
... 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (h) Was not satisfied on the evidence before it the (appellant) has a well-founded fear of persecution within the meaning of the Convention ...

3 It may be that some aspects of the appellant's claims have been understated in the reasons and in this summary.
It is appropriate that I set out her claims in a little more detail.
4 In the appellant's visa application she claimed that:
 
 'In my country there is one criminal group, which is called as MILF (More Islamic Liberation Front), which is most popular Terrorist group in Philippines, their activities to Terrorizes the government and the public.
Their activities are very strong in my province.
We are scared about that group, and the government does nothing for this problem so we use to take care of our village in shift basis.
Day and night we use to (guard) our village, and me and my other family members are very soft, as and when they demands they use to pay some money and manage for some time slowly they MILF.
Started demanding big amounts of money, which is not affordable for our family then they started troubling our family saying they will kill all of our family members and take over all of our properties.
I scared and left the country for these (reasons) .
And my family members are also scared, because I am working as teacher this terrorist group with Jamie Is lamia and they support each other they use to demand some part of my salary every month which is impossible for me since then I stop working life become very difficult to live and survive.
' 
 

5 She said, in answer to the question, 'What do you fear may happen to you (if you) go back to your country?
' :
 
 'If I was found to them, they will definitely kill me.
They are very furious I know a lot of cases, where they have killed many people.
MILF group is very strong and notorious group.
If they plan for killing anyone nobody can escape from them.
I think they have very good support from some political and police department officials.
If always my family members and me fear with these reasons, it not possible any better future and better education for our children.
At least cannot live peaceful life in future.
' 
 

6 In answer to the question, 'Who do you think may harm/mistreat you if you go back?
' she said:
 
 'MILF will kill me and I have potential life threat from them.
Main reason I am the person mainly refused to pay money for them.
' 
 

7 The appellant said that she did not think that the government would be able to protect her from MILF activity.
