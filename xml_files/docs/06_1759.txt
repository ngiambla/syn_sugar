 
 1 This is an application for constitutional writs.
Since the proceedings commenced, an amended application under s 476A of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) has been filed.
The application concerns a decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal made on 5 April 2006: see SRYYY v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] AATA 320.
The Tribunal affirmed a decision of a delegate of the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs of 4 December 2002 to refuse to grant the applicant a protection visa.
The delegate's refusal was on the ground that there were serious reasons for considering the applicant had committed crimes against humanity and war crimes.
2 This decision of the delegate was previously the subject of an unsuccessful application for review to the Tribunal: see SRYYY and Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] AATA 927.
In an appeal to this Court against the Tribunal's decision, Lindgren J found no jurisdictional error and dismissed the application as incompetent: see SRYYY v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCA 1588.
An appeal from that judgment was successful and the Full Court remitted the matter to the Tribunal for determination according to law: see SRYYY v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCAFC 42 ; (2005) 147 FCR 1.
Legislative framework 
 
3 Under s 36(2)(a) of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth), a criterion for a protection visa is that the Minister is satisfied that the visa applicant is a person to whom Australia has protection obligations under the Refugees Convention as amended by the Refugees Protocol.
Under Art 1F of that Convention:
 
 The provisions of this Convention shall not apply to any person with respect to whom there are serious reasons for considering that: 
 
 
 (a) he has committed a crime against peace, a war crime, or a crime against humanity , as defined in the international instruments drawn up to make provision in respect of such crimes; 
 
 (b) he has committed a serious non-political crime outside the country of refuge prior to his admission to that country as a refugee; 
 
 (c) he has been guilty of acts contrary to the purposes and principles of the United Nations.
(emphasis added) 

4 One means of ascertaining the meaning of a crime against humanity is to refer to the International Criminal Court Act 2002 (Cth).
Section 3(1) of the Act provides that the principal object of the Act is to facilitate compliance with Australia's obligations under the Statute of the International Criminal Court done at Rome on 17 July 1998 (the Rome Statute) which is Schedule 1 to that Act.
The Rome Statute is an international instrument of the type referred to in Art 1F(a): see SRYYY v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCAFC 42 ; (2005) 147 FCR 1 at [66] .
Relevantly, the Rome Statute provides:
 Article 7 
 Crimes against humanity

 (f) Torture; 
 ... 
 
 2.
For the purpose of paragraph 1: 
 
 
 
 (a) "Attack directed against any civilian population" means a course of conduct involving the multiple commission of acts referred to in paragraph 1 against any civilian population, pursuant to or in furtherance of a State or organizational policy to commit such attack; 
 ...

 The Tribunal's decision 
 
5 The Tribunal had to determine whether the applicant was subject to the exclusionary provisions in Art 1F of the Refugees Convention.
That is, it had to determine whether it was satisfied that "there are serious reasons for considering" that the applicant had committed a war crime or a crime against humanity.
6 The Tribunal set out the applicant's evidence at length.
It was from a number of sources (including departmental interviews and a transcript of oral evidence given at the previous tribunal hearing) and spanned the years 2000 to 2006.
The applicant joined the Sri Lankan Army in May 1997 as an ordinary soldier.
At that time there was a civil war between the Sri Lankan government and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE).
After a year or so on the frontline in Trincomalee and then another year at Elephant Pass the applicant requested a transfer because he disliked witnessing innocent civilians and fellow soldiers being killed and injured.
He was posted to Jaffna where he was assigned to a unit responsible for questioning suspects.
This sometimes involved threatening and harming detainees.
7 At [74] and [75] the Tribunal made the following findings:
 
 As part of the interrogation process, the applicant would seek to elicit information by intimidating detainees and using force and threats against them (T p144).
