 
1 Creative Festival Entertainment Pty Limited has promoted a music festivals known as the 'Big Day Out' since 1992.
The Big Day Out has become an established event in late January or early February of each year in venues at the Gold Coast, Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide and Perth.
Australian and international performing artists appear at each concert.
2 Tickets for the Big Day Out 2007 festival in all five venues went on sale on 13 October 2006.
They were available for purchase on the Big Day Out and Ticketmaster websites from approximately 9.30am on that morning and by about midday all available tickets for the Sydney concert had been sold.
By 20 October all available tickets to the Gold Coast shows had been sold.
At the time of the hearing all the Melbourne tickets had been sold, as had about half of the Adelaide and Perth tickets.
3 Creative is also running a weekly ballot over ten weeks on its Big Day Out website for extra tickets to the Gold Coast and Sydney shows.
This allows people who have not been able to purchase a ticket prior to the shows being sold out to buy them at the promoter's original prices.
The ballot is drawn automatically by computer on each Thursday until the end of December.
The purpose of the ballot is to dissuade people from purchasing tickets at an inflated price from third parties when they still have the opportunity to purchase them from Creative.
It is designed to combat the practice known as 'scalping'.
That occurs when people buy tickets with no intention of going to the event and then offer them for auction at prices higher than the cost price on sites such as those of eBay International AG.
4 eBay is a Swiss corporation which operates a website in Australia as well as other websites in various places in the world.
eBay's websites are part of an online global market place which the eBay group operates.
Registered users of eBay websites, known as members, are able to buy and sell many types of goods and services online.
eBay charges fees for sellers to advertise and offer items for sale on the eBay website.
No fees are payable by buyers or bidders.
Tickets to concerts and music festivals such as the Big Day Out are offered by eBay's members to others who wish to purchase on the eBay website.
5 A member who meets eBay's requirements for listing items for sale can use one, or a combination, of two different formats for sale, namely an auction format or a fixed price format known as 'buy it now'.
These formats operate in the following way.
In the auction format listing, the seller offers the relevant item or items, by describing it or them, setting a starting price and identifying the duration of the listing.
Potential buyers or bidders search or browse the eBay website, visit the listing and place bids on the item.
At the expiry of the listing the highest bidder is obliged, in accordance with the terms of eBay's user agreement, to buy the item from the seller for the price specified in the highest bid.
In the fixed price format listing, the seller offers an item or items by again describing it or them, stating the fixed price and the duration of the listing.
Buyers again search or browse the eBay website.
If someone is interested in buying the item, there is no bidding involved.
The buyer simply clicks on a webpage button 'buy it now' to purchase at the fixed price.
The listing then expires.
ISSUE 
 
6 The central issue in the proceedings is that eBay contends Creative has contravened s 52 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth).
eBay says that there is a misleading or deceptive representation conveyed by a provision on the back of the ticket for the 2007 Big Day Out events.
It is in what is called a condition of sale, which reads as follows:
 
 
 '6.
Should this ticket be re-sold for profit it will be cancelled and the holder will be refused entry.
This condition specifically prohibits ticket re-sale through online market or auction sites.
' 
 
 

7 In effect, eBay contends that Creative's use of the provision constitutes misleading or deceptive conduct by conveying one or more of the following representations:
 
 
 (1) every ticket that is resold for profit will be cancelled by Creative;
 (2) the holder of any such ticket will be refused entry to the Big Day Out 2007 festival;
 (3) Creative has the means available to it of detecting the tickets which are subject to such resale with sufficient frequency to warrant an assertion of inevitability of such cancellation and refusal of entry;
 (4) Creative has the means to cancel each and every such ticket so sold and to refuse the ticket holder entry to the festival;
 (5) the provision is enforceable as a condition of the ticket in all cases.

 

8 eBay says that each representation is incorrect and each of the first two are representations as to a future matter for which Creative did not have reasonable grounds (see s 51A(1) of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth)).
TICKET SALES 
 
9 There are four principal means by which Big Day Out tickets for 2007 were sold, namely:
 
 
 (1) direct sale online from the Big Day Out website;
 (2) direct sale online from the Ticketmaster website;
 (3) direct sale over the counter at Ticketmaster or other ticket agent offices;
 (4) direct sale over the counter by other retail outlets.

 

10 It is necessary to analyse each of these methods of sale in turn.
There are other online vendors but nothing in particular turns upon their terms of trading in Big Day Out tickets.
Online sales have resulted in about 60% of all tickets sold for Big Day Out 2007.
About 41% of tickets have been sold through the Big Day Out website.
Ticketmaster, principally, and other ticket agencies have been responsible for the other sales online.
Telephone sales by ticket agents account for another 7% and ticket agent outlets selling over the counter account for approximately 14% of sales.
Other retail outlets account for the balance of sales.
BIG DAY OUT WEBSITE 
 
11 Creative appointed an agent, Online Fulfilment, for the purpose of processing orders and payment for tickets purchased on Big Day Out's website.
Online Fulfilment also arranges for the dispatch of tickets to purchasers.
A purchaser would enter the Big Day Out website.
A webpage appeared which offered the facility of buying tickets online by clicking on a link.
The same page of the website also had a link for opening up the terms and conditions of buying the tickets online.
If one clicked on the button to buy tickets, the purchaser was then redirected seamlessly and unnoticeably to Online Fulfilment's website.
And, it is on the latter website that the transaction which resulted in the despatch of a ticket was completed.
If the purchaser had clicked the terms and conditions link on Big Day Out's website prior to being redirected to Online Fulfilment's website, he or she would have seen that, inter alia, the wording of condition 6 of the conditions of sale which I have set out above.
That wording was also printed on all of the tickets issued for Big Day Out 2007 festivals.
12 However, until 8 November 2006 Online Fulfilment's website contained the conditions of sale that had been used in the festival held earlier in 2006.
Only condition 6 in those conditions of sale was in different terms to those used for the 2007 festivals.
It read:
 
 
 '6.
Should this ticket be re-sold or transferred for profit or commercial gain it will become voidable and the holder may be refused entry to, or ejected from the venue.
' 
 
 

13 It is convenient to refer to this as the old condition 6.
The old condition 6 was repeated on five successive Online Fulfilment web pages which had to be accessed in order to buy a ticket online after the purchaser was redirected in the purchase of a ticket through the Big Day Out website.
It was only changed after eBay commenced these proceedings and pointed to this anomaly.
THE CONDITIONS 
 
14 The wording of the terms and conditions for Big Day Out 2007 tickets on the Big Day Out website (with the exception of the difference in condition 6 of the conditions of sale up to 8 November 2006) has been identical to their wording on the Online Fulfilment website.
15 There is one further, slight, difference in the wording in the websites and the wording of the tickets themselves.
The tickets have always had the new condition 6 for the Big Day Out 2007.
But immediately before the terms and conditions are set out in small print on the reverse of the ticket appear the words:
 
 'By purchasing this ticket, you agree to the following:' 
 

16 Each of these terms and conditions for both the Big Day Out and Online Fulfilment websites and ticket have four headings followed by numbered paragraphs.
The first heading 'Conditions of Sale' has seven paragraphs underneath it, including the old or new condition 6.
Next is a heading 'Conditions of Entry' with nine numbered paragraphs.
The next heading is 'Safety' with four numbered paragraphs, and finally there is a heading 'Some Useful Advice' with six numbered paragraphs.
At the end of each presentation of the terms and conditions the following appears (even on the websites themselves):
 
 'CHECK OUT OUR WEBSITE FOR MORE DETAILS: www.bigdayout.com' 
 

17 The conditions of sale and conditions of entry as they appear on the ticket are in the following terms:

They are not contractual: e.g.
'4.

'
 PRINCIPLES FOR PURCHASE OF TICKETS WITHOUT SIGNATURE 
 
19 Where a ticket or other document is intended by the issuer to contain terms of the contract such as an exemption clause or a foreign jurisdiction clause or other special condition, the issuer cannot rely on those terms unless, at the time of contract, it did all that was reasonably necessary to bring the terms to the other party's attention: Oceanic Sun Line Special Shipping Company Inc v Fay [1988] HCA 32 ; (1988) 165 CLR 197 at 228-229 per Brennan J; MacRobertson Miller Airline Services v Commissioner of State Taxation (WA) [1975] HCA 55 ; (1975) 133 CLR 125 at 137 per Stephen J, 143 per Jacobs J; Sydney Corporation v West [1965] HCA 68 ; (1965) 114 CLR 481 at 485 per Barwick CJ and Taylor J; see too at 503 per Windeyer J.
20 In Fay 165 CLR at 228 Brennan J (with whom Gaudron J agreed on this contractual issue at 165 CLR at 261) considered arrangements which had been made for passengers to pay the fare in Australia for a cruise in Grecian waters.
They received an exchange order in Australia that would be handed over in Greece for the actual ticket.
The exchange order was expressed in contractual language and reserved to the carrier the right to cancel any cruise.
Brennan J considered that the contract was made when the fare was paid and that nothing in the wording of the ticket could affect the terms of the antecedent contract (165 CLR at 227).
As he said, if no contract came into existence until the ticket was issued and accepted in Greece, there would be no consideration to support the carrier's right asserted in the exchange order to refuse to refund the passage money if the passenger cancelled.
Brennan J referred to the consequence of forfeiture of the fare as a reason to find that (165 CLR at 228):
 
 'The better analysis of the transaction is that the defendant was bound to issue a ticket in exchange for the exchange order in performance of a contract of carriage already made, but the defendant was given no right to introduce new conditions of carriage by printing them on the ticket.
The payment of the fare may rightly be regarded as the price of an option to acquire a ticket, but the option was not to acquire a mere piece of paper.
It was an option to acquire a voucher or certificate of entitlement to be carried on terms already agreed -- not on terms which the parties had yet to agree on.

 
 It was too late after the original contract was made to add conditions which were not incorporated in it.
' 
 

21 And Wilson and Toohey JJ (with whom Deane J agreed on this issue at 165 CLR at 256) said (165 CLR at 206):
 
 'If a contract of carriage was not concluded before the respondent left Australia then it must follow that, notwithstanding that the entire passage money had been paid and that a particular cabin on a particular vessel had been allocated to him for a specified cruise and that although nothing remained for him to do except to present himself in Athens with the exchange order, the appellant came under no obligation to carry him until he did so.
Such a construction of the circumstances flies in the face of common sense and cannot be accepted.
When he left Australia the respondent had a contractual right to receive from the appellant on presentation of the exchange order in Athens a passage ticket which enabled him to board the vessel and occupy the specified cabin for the duration of the cruise subject only to such conditions as are found to form part of the contract.
' 
 

22 Here, new condition 6 imposed, if it were contractual and enforceable, substantial limitations on the ability of an original purchaser or a holder of a ticket in dealing with it.
Many online purchasers were given no notice of this; indeed all online purchasers of the Sydney and Gold Coast concerts knew nothing of it; and those purchasing from the Big Day Out website were informed only of old condition 6, but later received tickets with the new one.
It is necessary to look at each of the 4 methods of sale to appreciate their potentially differing legal consequences.
SALES ONLINE FROM BIG DAY OUT WEBSITE 
 
23 The mechanism for purchase on the Big Day Out website involved the following steps after the seamless and unnoticeable redirection to the Online Fulfilment website.
The purchaser was presented with a webpage with a subheading 'Tickets and Shopping Cart Contents'.
One could place an order by clicking on a box next to the words 'I have read and agreed to the following terms and conditions' (being those set out above with the exception that the old condition 6 appeared until 8 November 2006).
A pop up dialogue box then appeared with a message 'Please agree the terms and conditions before you proceed' and the option 'OK' appeared in that box.
The purchaser would next have to click the word 'OK' and the pop up box then disappeared from the webpage.
The purchaser then clicked on to the box next to the words "I have read and agreed to the following terms and conditions' and a green tick appeared in the box.
The purchaser then clicked on the words 'Place an order'.
A new web page was opened with the subheading 'Tickets' and the words 'Order details'.
After completing that, a dialogue box appeared and the purchaser then entered credit card and other details.
Thereafter a webpage opened with the subheading 'Tickets' and the words 'You are about to order these items from the Big Day Out website' directly beneath them.
Another full set of the conditions was set out on that webpage.
Having clicked on the 'Send this Order' button, a new webpage opened stating that the order had been confirmed.
It recorded that the purchaser would be receiving a confirmation email stating everything that would be needed to facilitate the payment process.
The purchaser was told that once the email was read and all the steps carefully followed, he or she would receive the ticket(s) as quickly as possible.
The webpage indicated that the order had been confirmed for the relevant ticket(s), the price had been successfully charged to the nominated credit card account and the ticket(s) would be mailed to the address given by the purchaser.
An email was sent immediately following this which confirmed that the order had been successfully charged to the credit card and would now be processed and tickets mailed to the purchaser.
24 eBay contends that a contract in writing was made on the terms displayed on the Online Fulfilment website.
eBay argues the contract was, in effect, signed electronically by the purchaser through his or her clicking on the relevant buttons agreeing to the terms and conditions, making payment and receiving the webpage and email confirmations of the order.
On this analysis the contract was signed and completed after the payment and nominated purchaser details were accepted.
The terms of the signed contract were those set out in the webpages detailing the terms and conditions in accordance with Toll (FGCT) Pty Limited v Alphapharm Pty Limited [2004] HCA 52 ; (2004) 219 CLR 165.
25 eBay argues that, objectively, a reasonable person in the position of the parties would have concluded that terms and conditions upon which the ticket was sold to the purchaser were those repeated five times throughout the process on the different webpages.
These incorporated old condition 6.
The ticket that was delivered in consequence of a transaction occurring online before 8 November 2006, however, contained new condition 6 which eBay says can have no contractual force or effect because it had been added without agreement after the contract was made.
Thus, eBay says, in addition to the other inaccuracies it claims, the ticket in such cases is misleading because of its different terms and it conveys a false representation that new condition 6 is a part of the contract.
26 Creative contends that new condition 6 is merely a statement in different language to the same force and effect of old condition 6 and has no difference in substance.
27 I find that the contract for purchase of tickets made on the Big Day Out website before the wording of old condition 6 was changed, occurred on terms that included the old condition 6 and did not include new condition 6.
Since all the tickets for the Sydney and Gold Coast concerts were sold prior to the change in wording, it must follow that the 30,000 sold in this way from the Sydney concert and the 20,000 tickets sold for the Gold Coast concert contained terms which included old condition 6 and not new condition 6.
28 By sending a ticket with new condition 6, Creative represented that that was part of the contract under which the tickets were purchased and that the condition was effective as a condition of sale.
That representation was in trade or commerce and was false.
In particular, the ticket had the statement, which was false for online purchases from the Big Day Out website, that 'by purchasing this ticket you agree to' the inclusion of new condition 6.
None of the tickets sold online by using the Big Day Out website prior to 8 November 2006 contained new condition 6.
Creative was not entitled to represent to purchasers or to other persons into whose hands these tickets might come that new condition 6 had any contractual force or was at all relevant to the contract upon which the ticket had been acquired.
Yet the very face of the ticket contradicted the contract which Creative had made on its website (or that of its agent, Online Fulfilment) with the purchaser.
29 Old condition 6 operated to confer upon Creative an election to avoid a ticket, if it were resold or transferred for profit or commercial gain.
The ticket remained valid unless and until Creative acted by making its election: Suttor v Gundowda Pty Ltd [1950] HCA 35 ; (1950) 81 CLR 418.
Moreover, old condition 6 indicated that the holder 'may be refused entry or rejected', again suggesting that Creative had first to exercise its election before that consequence would be asserted by it.
30 In contrast, new condition 6 is worded to operate upon the happening of an event, namely a resale for profit.
On the occurrence of the event the ticket 'will be cancelled and the holder will be refused entry'.
Creative says that the same contractual principles of construction apply and that the cancellation of the ticket, despite the imperative wording, is not a contractually automatic consequence of the occurrence of the event of resale for profit.
That is because the purchaser is not entitled to rely upon his or her own default in adhering to the contractual requirements, but the innocent party, Creative, is entitled to elect whether to keep the contract alive and, if this is the true construction of the contract, it says that there is nothing misleading or deceptive about its use of words in new condition 6 to convey that meaning.
31 In Suttor 81 CLR at 441 Latham CJ, Williams and Fullagar JJ said that where the event in question was one which could not occur without default on the part of one party to the contract, the position was clear:
 
 'The provision is then construed as making the contract not void but voidable: only the party who is not in default can avoid it, and he may please himself whether he does so or not.
' 
 

The context of the principle which their Honours were discussing was one in which the party in default would be advantaged if termination occurred automatically.
The principle to be applied in such a case is that a party should not be entitled to rely upon his or her own default in respect of the occurrence which the contract provides will bring about its end.
32 In the present situation the intention of the parties is that new condition 6 is to benefit only Creative.
The purchaser gains nothing from a termination arising from his or her being in default.
Thus the purchaser has no relevant motivation to be in default under new condition 6 so as to render the ticket void.
This is quite different from the situation in, say, a conveyancing contract which provides for the contract to be avoided on happening of an event which one or other party or both can bring about.
In such a case the implication of a term which denies to the party in default the facility of engineering the end of his or her contractual obligation is necessary.
The innocent party should not be put into the position that the party in default can escape from his or her obligation by breaching, rather than adhering to, the contract.
33 The purchaser of a ticket to Big Day Out 2007 has no relevant obligation the breach of which will benefit him or her in a way that it would be to his or her advantage for an automatic cancellation of the ticket to occur.
Quite the contrary, the purchaser wishes no such thing to occur by his or her default.
The natural and ordinary meaning of new condition 6 suggests that the evident purpose of it is to prevent the purchaser selling the ticket for profit on pain of it being cancelled if he or she did.
In that context, the purchaser could not rely on his or her own default in making such a sale so as to escape from an obligation under the contract and thereby render that which he or she seeks to resell valueless.
34 In Gange v Sullivan [1966] HCA 55 ; (1966) 116 CLR 418 at 441, Taylor, Menzies and Owen JJ noted that the first step to deciding the question of construction in the case like the present was to understand the condition and its significance to the parties.
They continued:
 
 ' Suttor v. Gundowda Pty.
Ltd. ((1950) [1950] HCA 35 ; 81 CLR 418), together with other cases, was relied upon to support the conclusion that non-fulfilment of the condition did not of itself bring the contract to an end but did no more than render the contract voidable at the instance of a party not responsible for the non-fulfilment of the condition.
Whilst the effect of a condition must in every case depend upon the language in which it is expressed and a decision upon the meaning of one condition cannot determine the meaning of a different condition, the authorities cited do show a disposition on the part of courts to treat non-fulfilment of a condition such as that here under consideration as rendering a contract voidable rather than void in order to forestall a party to a contract from gaining some advantage from his own conduct in securing, or contributing to, the non-fulfilment of a condition bringing the contract to an end.
' 
 

35 In Quinn Villages Pty Ltd v Mulherin [2006] QCA 433 at [44] Cullinane J (with whom McMurdo P and Holmes JA agreed) said that a court would give effect to a clause bringing a contract to an end in the eventualities for which it provides if the language was sufficiently explicit.
Nonetheless, he noted that there was a plain disposition to treat such a clause as rendering the contract voidable not void: see also Havenbar Pty Ltd v Butterfield [1974] HCA 24 ; (1974) 133 CLR 449 at 456 per Menzies, Stephen and Jacobs JJ.
Here, new condition 6, is designed to bring about automatic termination because of the breach by the purchaser.
Such a breach is not rationally capable of being taken advantage of by the purchaser so as to call for the implication that the innocent party may elect to avoid the contract, because he or she has paid the money, obtained a ticket which is sought to be passed on, and then ceases to have any real interest in the subject matter.
Rather, the clause is directed to preventing the purchaser in engaging in that very activity.
There is no benefit to the vendor, Creative, in giving it an election in such circumstances as to whether to treat the contract as at an end.
The wording of this new condition 6 suggests that it should operate to avoid tickets automatically.
It was not suggested by Creative in argument how the application of the principle that a party is not entitled to rely upon his or her own default, should enliven the construction of new condition 6 that it be voidable rather than void.
36 The ticket gave a right of admission to a Big Day Out 2007 festival, subject to the conditions of entry.
Obviously, new condition 6 forms part of the conditions of entry, because it is directed to the right to enter of a holder of a cancelled ticket.
