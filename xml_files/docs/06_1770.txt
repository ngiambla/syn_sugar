 
1 Mr Hillig is the Administrator of Worimi Local Aboriginal Land Council ('the Land Council').
He seeks a declaration in separate proceedings ('the Hillig proceedings') that no native title exists over land at Port Stephens ('the Land').
The Land Council owns the fee simple in the Land, subject to any native title rights or interests (s 36(9) of the Aboriginal Land Rights Act 1983 (NSW)) and wishes to sell the Land.
On 22 August 2006, I struck out a claimant application by Mr Dates, who prefers to be known as Worimi, for a determination that native title exists over the Land ('the first application'): Hillig as Administrator of Worimi Local Aboriginal Land Council v Minister for Lands for the State of New South Wales (No 2) [2006] FCA 1115.
Worimi has now filed a further claimant application ('the second application').
These proceedings concern the second application.
Mr Hillig moves the Court for orders that the second application be struck out.
2 In order to deal with Mr Hillig's motion, it is necessary to reiterate some matters considered in Hillig (No 2).
The first application was a claimant application by Worimi on behalf of women who asserted a native title interest in the Land as a sacred site for women.
Worimi had sought, by a draft proposed application ('the proposed application'), to amend the first application to assert a native title interest held by himself and his family.
The claim group of the second application is the same as the claim group identified in the proposed application considered in Hillig (No 2).

 
3 In Hillig (No 2) at [60] I discussed whether s 61(1) of the Native Title Act 1993 (Cth) ('the Act') requires the claim group to consist of the whole group of persons who hold native title over an area or whether it can comprise a sub-group which is only part of a larger group of native title holders.
I concluded that, subject to an exception that is not relevant in this case, where a small family group or sub-group is only part of the group who claim to hold native title, the sub-group does not hold the common or group rights or interests within s 61.
4 I determined that the first application should be struck out (at [72]).
I did not permit Worimi to amend that application for reasons that I gave.
I did, however, give him the opportunity to file a further claimant application.
A relevant consideration was the delayed hearing of the Hillig proceedings for a declaration of no native title over the Land ( Hillig (No 2) at [79]).
I directed at [83] that any further application filed by Worimi include, in accordance with the requirements of the Act, the proper identification of and authorisation by the claim group; the connection between the claim group and the relevant traditional laws and customs observed; and the basis for the claim by that claim group from the time of sovereignty.
5 Worimi filed the second application on 19 September 2006 and in so doing initiated these proceedings.
Without objection from Worimi, I made an order that Mr Hillig be joined.
Mr Hillig now seeks to strike out the proceedings pursuant to s 84C of the Act or to dismiss them summarily pursuant to O 20 r 2 of the Federal Court Rules .

 
6 Mr Hillig accepts that he bears a heavy onus in seeking to strike out the proceedings.
He does not rely on s 31A of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth).
He submits that the test in General Steel Industries Inc v Commissioner for Railways (NSW) [1964] HCA 69 ; (1964) 112 CLR 125 at 129 is satisfied: the second application is so obviously untenable that it cannot possibly succeed.
He points out that, as expressed in General Steel , the test is met where the case disclosed is one which the Court is satisfied cannot succeed and where it is manifest that to allow the pleading to stand would involve useless expense (see also Lindon v Commonwealth of Australia (No 2) [1996] HCA 14 ; (1996) 136 ALR 251 at 255---6).
7 If the evidence were to establish unequivocally that Worimi has not been authorised by the native title claim group, the application may be summarily dismissed for failure to comply with s 61 of the [2004] FCAFC 226 ; Act ( Bodney v Bropho (2004) 140 FCR 77 at [52] per Stone J).
However, the application should only be dismissed where the claim as expressed is untenable and on the basis of the evidence most favourable to Worimi ( Landers v State of South Australia (2003) 128 FCR 49 at [7]).
THE SECOND APPLICATION 
 
8 Worimi makes the second application as a member of the native title claim group, authorised by all other persons in the claim group.
He claims to be authorised in accordance with a process of traditional decision making whereby ' the eldest male of the family makes all the decisions on behalf of the immediate family and about the family's traditional country and deals with matters arising in relation to those decisions ' (my emphasis).
He asserts in the second application that all the persons in the native title claim group ' agreed to and adopted the traditional decision making process that the eldest male of the family would make the application and deal with the matters arising in relation to it '.
9 The other members of the claim group are Worimi's wife, Cynthia Dates and daughters Priscilla Dates, Rachael Dates, Beryl Dates and Sheena Dates.
Worimi claims native title rights in accordance with and subject to the traditional laws and customs of the claim group, subject to adaptation and change.
He acknowledges that ' these rights may co-exist with other statutory or common law rights in relation to ' the Land.
The affidavits of the second application 
 
10 Worimi has filed an affidavit in support of the second application.
He speaks of his association and physical connection with the Garuahgal area, which includes the Land.
He says that he has camped all over the area.
He has taken wood and other natural materials from the Land for his art works.
He describes the Garuahgal area as being a 'state' of Worimi country in a similar sense to which New South Wales is a State of the Commonwealth of Australia.
11 Worimi says that he was taught by his father's mother that there were sites sacred to Worimi women on and adjacent to the Land.
As a Worimi man, he is not allowed to know most of the law and custom regarding those sites.
He says that Worimi women travelled to the Land and the area adjoining the Land to have their babies.
After having the babies, the women would take them to a place near the Land on an area of Kingsley Beach, known as the Poona .
There the women bathed the babies in the sea water and gave them their tribal totem.
The women would then take the babies to an area adjacent to the Land, to a billabong and wash the sea water off the babies.
They would then choose a special spot ' on the Land or the adjoining areas ' to bury the afterbirth.
From Worimi's affidavit, the site or sites sacred to women are described as ' on and near to the Land ' and also as not on the Land but adjacent to it.
Worimi says that, under Worimi law, men are not allowed to go to the women's site at the Poona .
There is no restriction on going to the billabong or the Land.
12 Worimi says that he is the custodian of the Land.
His father had been the eldest initiated male in his family, which meant that he was responsible for making decisions about his country and his family and had responsibility for protecting culturally significant places, including the Land and the coastal areas nearby.
On his father's death, the position of custodian passed to Worimi, his eldest son.
13 Worimi now believes that he and his children are the only persons who currently have native title rights and interests in the Land.
He explains the fact that a number of Worimi women have sworn affidavits in the Hillig proceedings saying that there were no sacred women's sites on the Land ([20] to [22] below) by concluding that they have not been taught about the sites.
Worimi says that it appears that he may be the only Worimi person who was given the native title rights and interests in the Land under traditional laws and customs.
He is passing those laws and customs on to his children so that they also hold native title rights.
14 He claims authorisation under the traditional decision making process whereby the eldest male of the family makes all the decisions and that the others in the claim group agreed and adopted that traditional decision making process.
Affidavits of Worimi's wife and daughters have been filed asserting that Worimi has the right to bring the application as the oldest male member of the family.
Worimi's earlier affidavits 
 
15 Mr Hillig tendered earlier affidavits made by Worimi and filed in support of the first application and in the Hillig proceedings.
Ms Jowett did not object to the Court having regard to those affidavits; indeed, she relied upon them to establish the existence of an arguable case that Worimi, his wife and his children possess individual or group native title rights in the Land.
16 In his original affidavit of 19 August 2005, filed in the Hillig proceedings, Worimi asserted that he held native title in the Land as did the Garuahgal people.
He said that part of the Land was a sacred and secret place for women.
17 In a more extensive affidavit of 20 January 2006, filed in support of the first application, he said that his authority to make the first application was as '[c] ustodian and [p] rotector of the Garuahgal women ' who wished ' to reclaim their secret, sacred place ': a ' secret birthing place of tribal women '.
He said there that he had been given the Land by his father who told him that he must protect it.
His grandmother was the custodian and protector of Boat Harbour.
The Land between Birubi Beach and Boat Harbour was a special sacred place for women.
The area described as the women's site encompassed the Land.
The women gave birth there.
He said that the babies were washed and baptised in the fresh water spring.
His father pointed out a special rock which was the boundary of the secret women's place.
He and his father camped and fished at Boat Harbour and Worimi has continued his association with the Land.
18 Worimi filed a further affidavit in the Hillig proceedings sworn 28 March 2006.
He reiterated in that affidavit that his father had given him all the land between Boat Harbour and Birubi Beach for care and safe keeping.
He restated that his grandmother told him stories of how the Boat Harbour land was a secret, sacred place for women and that the tribal women came to the Land to give birth.
He stated that his grandmother told him how they washed the newborn infants in the fresh water stream that runs along the Land.
His father also told him stories of the secret women's place and pointed out the special rock which was the boundary where men could not pass.
That rock was in the Land, adjoining the land at Boat Harbour.
He also described his own association with the Land as a place where he lived and camped and fished.
19 In an affidavit sworn 25 May 2006 and filed in support of the first application, Worimi said, in respect of the Land: 
 
 'To say that there was no secret women's place is ridiculous.
The babies were born in the area and the birthing ceremonies took place in the area.
The subject land has a fresh water stream running through it.
This land was most definitely the place where the babies were washed and baptised after their birth.
As part of the traditional ceremony, the after-birth would have been buried.
' 
 
 The other affidavits 
 
20 In addition to tendering Worimi's earlier affidavits, Mr Hillig sought to tender and rely on affidavits sworn by Kelvin Dates (Worimi's brother), Valerie Merrick, Viola Brown and Carol Ridgeway-Bissett ('the deponents') and filed in the Hillig proceedings.
Each of the deponents identified themselves as Aboriginal members of the Worimi Nation or tribe and denied the existence of any site sacred to women on or adjacent to the Land.
21 Ms Jowett objects to the relevance of these affidavits to the strike out motion.
She submits that ' the information contained in the [a] ffidavits has no more probative value than evidence from a stranger who was stopped in the street and asked their opinion about the content of native title in the Land '.
22 Worimi refers to the deponents in his affidavit filed in support of the second application and states, with reference to their evidence, that he now believes that others have not been taught about the traditional laws and customs associated with the Land.
He further states that he believes that he and his children are the only persons who currently have native title rights and interests in the Land.
To the extent that Worimi himself cites the evidence given by the deponents to explain the composition and identity of the native title claim group, the fact that the deponents gave that evidence is relevant.
The deponent's evidence as to the existence of native title rights is not relevant to the determination of the strike out application.
Mr Hillig's submissions 
 
23 Mr Wright, who appears for Mr Hillig, submits that the second application suffers from the same "fatal defects" as did the first application, which was struck out in Hillig (No 2) .
