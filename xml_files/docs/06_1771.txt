 
1 The first appellant is an Indonesian citizen of Chinese ethnicity.
During riots in 1998 his business salon in Jakarta was looted and destroyed.
While neither he nor his family were harmed physically, the Refugee Review Tribunal accepted that he had a fear of persecution.
It was not satisfied, however, on the basis of independent evidence and the evidence given by him, that his fear of persecution was well-founded.
2 No specific Convention claims were made by the other appellants, his wife and two children.
The fate of their applications, as members of the family unit, rested on that finding.
Their appeal to this Court is dependent on the grounds raised by the first appellant and it is convenient for me to refer to him in these reasons as 'the appellant'.
3 The Tribunal decision was made on 9 December 1999 and dated 12 January 2000.
The Tribunal gave three bases for its conclusion.
