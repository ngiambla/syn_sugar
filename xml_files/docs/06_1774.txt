 
 1 This interlocutory application raises the question whether a liquidator's remuneration for services in a winding up by the Court should include payment for work done and reimbursement for expenses incurred in responding to requests for information by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) concerning the liquidation.

 The Winding Up Order 
 
 2 Mr Barry Kenneth Hamilton (the Liquidator) is the liquidator of the Piggott, Wood  Baker Managed Investment Scheme (the Scheme), having been so appointed by order of Sundberg J on 13 December 2001 on the application of ASIC.
3 The Scheme was an unregistered managed investment scheme conducted by the Hobart legal firm Piggott, Wood  Baker.
The Scheme involved the receipt of funds from Investors and the lending out of those funds on security of mortgages over real estate.
Sundberg J ordered that the Scheme be wound up pursuant to s 601EE(2) of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) with the Liquidator having all the powers that a liquidator of a company would have under s 477 of the Corporations Act , including certain powers specified in the Order.
4 One of those powers, as provided in par 2(b)(xi) of the Order, was the power
 "to receive remuneration for services in an amount equal to the cost of the time actually spent in the performance of such services by the Liquidator or any partner in or employee of the firm to which the Liquidator is attached, calculated at the standard rates of the firm from time to time for work of that nature, together with all reasonably [sic] out of pocket expenses, provided that such rates do not exceed the rates recommended as at 1 July 1999 from time to time by the Insolvency Practitioners Association of Australia plus GST if applicable, such remuneration to be paid from the proceeds of the winding-up and/or such sources as may be available.
" 
 
 5 Subsequent to Sundberg J's order the Legal Profession Act 1993 (Tas) was amended by the insertion of s 108(2)(a)(iii) , which provided that the Solicitors Trust (the Trust), a statutory corporation (see s 95) administering the Guarantee Fund (see ss 97 , 107 ),
 "must apply the funds of the Guarantee Fund 
 
 (a) in the payment of any 
 (i) ... 
 (ii) ... 
 
 
 
 (iii) remuneration payable to, and costs incurred by, a liquidator appointed under s 601EE of the Corporations Act 2001 of the Commonwealth, to wind up an unregistered managed investment scheme operated by a firm, ... on the application of the Australian Securities and Investment Commission ..." 
 
 
 
 
 6 In consequence of that amendment, and on the application of ASIC, I made an order on 20 August 2002 (i) amending the order of Sundberg J by removing the words "the proceeds of the winding-up and/or such sources as may be available" and replacing them with the words "the Guarantee Fund pursuant to section 108(2)(a)(iii) of the Legal Profession Act 1993 " and (ii) inserting the following:
 "Prior to the liquidator obtaining payment of his remuneration, costs and expenses from the Guarantee Fund pursuant to section 108(2)(a)(iii) of the Legal Profession Act 1993 , the District Registrar review the liquidator's remuneration, costs and expenses and confirm, increase or reduce that remuneration, cost and expenses.
" 
 7 The Order makes provision for the reporting by the Liquidator as to the progress of the winding up.
Under par 2(e) of the Order the Liquidator is required no later than 21 days after the date of the Order to send to Investors in the Scheme notice of his appointment, the estimated timetable for winding up, the "proposed two-monthly report to each Investor referred to in subparagraph (g) [sic, presumably (f)] below and a contact address for the Liquidator".
8 By par 2(f) the Liquidator is required, before the expiry of two months after the sending of the letter referred to, and on a two-monthly basis thereafter, to
 "prepare and send a newsletter to each Investor and to ASIC detailing: 
 
 
 
 
 (i) actions taken in relation to particular loans during the previous two months; and 
 (ii) actions anticipated to be taken during the following two months.
" 
 
 
 
 9 By par 2(g) the Liquidator is to send to each Investor "a quarterly account, including a statement setting out the fees, costs and disbursements (including anticipated remuneration of the Liquidator as yet not approved by the Court) allocated to the particular loan or loans in which the Investor has an interest".

 Monthly bills submitted 
 
 10 Pursuant to the Order as amended, the Liquidator submitted monthly bills to the District Registrar for the months of December 2005 to August 2006 both inclusive.
The District Registrar confirmed the bills.
The Trust paid the Liquidator the amounts of the bills but after deducting the Liquidator's fees and expenses in responding to enquiries from ASIC amounting to $85,639.65.

 The present applications 
 
 11 The Liquidator has brought the present application under s 479(3) of the Corporations Act and par 2(c) of the Order seeking directions that the Liquidator is entitled to be paid by the Trust the sum of $85,639.65.
12 In the course of hearing ASIC was given leave to file an application under s 477(6) of the Corporations Act and pursuant to par 2(c), for a direction 
 "that the Liquidator not exercise his power to receive remuneration or recover expenses for or relating to his responses to the ASIC enquiries initiated by its letter dated 20 December 2005, which responses concluded with the Liquidator's letter dated 7 August 2006 to ASIC, other than remuneration or expenses for or relating to 
 (a) work which would have been done in any event, or 
 (b) work which added value to the liquidation.
" 
 
 13 There is no issue as to quantum.
ASIC accepts that the work in question has in fact been done by the Liquidator and charged for at the appropriate rate and the expenses incurred.
Either expressly or by necessary implication ASIC's case is that the work is not "services" within the meaning of par 2(b)(xi) of the Order.
ASIC does not allege any improper conduct on the part of the Liquidator.
Nor is there any criticism of the District Registrar.

 Complaints by Trust to ASIC 
 
 14 On 21 February 2005 the Trust wrote to ASIC referring to another administration which involved an application to this Court relating to the level of fees and their reasonableness and "wonder(ing) whether ASIC might hold similar concerns in the context of the PWB matter".
The letter expressed "concerns for the quantum of fees and the seemingly endless and questionable cost benefit of some of the steps being taken by the liquidator".
Copies of some earlier correspondence between the Liquidator's solicitors and the Trust were enclosed.
15 On 2 May the Trust wrote again thanking ASIC for the opportunity to discuss several matters concerning the Scheme, commending the Liquidator for his actions in relation to another matter concerning the Scheme, which is not relevant for present purposes, but noting that there remained "matters of concern" which had been discussed.
16 On 27 May the Trust wrote to ASIC enquiring as to the reasonableness of the legal costs and expenses of investigating possible proceedings against a valuer.
17 On 9 August the Trust sent an email to ASIC noting total costs and expenses paid to the Liquidator and also those concerned with the possible action against the valuer, and enquiring whether ASIC was "intending to do anything about these matters".
18 On 19 October the Trust wrote to ASIC complaining about the payments to the Liquidator in respect of the Scheme liquidation and two other similar liquidations.
