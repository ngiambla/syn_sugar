 
1 This application arises out of the failure by the defendant, Mr Andrew Pappas, to comply with notices under the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001 (Cth) ('the ASIC Act'), requiring him to attend for examination by, and give assistance to, the Australian Securities  Investments Commission ('the Commission') in connection with an investigation being conducted by the Commission.
Following the defendant's failure to comply with notices given by the Commission, the Court made orders that the defendant appear on a specified day before officers of the Commission for examination and provide the Commission all reasonable assistance with its investigation.
2 The defendant failed to appear on the appointed day.
After he was charged with contempt for failing to comply with the Court's orders, the defendant attended an examination by officers of the Commission.
He was subsequently charged with contempt for failing to provide the Commission all reasonable assistance in giving answers at that examination.
On the day on which the contempt charges were fixed for hearing, undertakings were given by the defendant to the Court that he would attend a further examination and would provide the Commission with all reasonable assistance with its investigation of certain enumerated topics.
The hearing was then adjourned until after the date of that further examination.
The defendant was subsequently charged with contempt for breach of the undertaking given to the Court.
3 Thus, there are three charges presently before the Court.
It is desirable to deal separately with the circumstances relating to each charge.
However, before doing so, I shall say something about the circumstances that led to the charges.
THE CIRCUMSTANCES LEADING TO THE CHARGES 
 
4 The Commission is conducting an investigation, pursuant to s 13 of the ASIC Act, into dealings of the defendant in January 2005 in securities of Computershare Limited and Ten Network Holdings Limited and into loans that he obtained to fund those and other dealings.
Section 19 of the ASIC Act applies where the Commission, on reasonable grounds, suspects or believes that a person can give information relevant to a matter that it is investigating under s 13 of the ASIC Act.
Under s 19(2), the Commissioner may, by written notice, require such a person to give to the Commission all reasonable assistance in connection with the investigation and to appear before a specified staff member of the Commission for examination on oath and to answer questions.
5 The Commission required the defendant to attend such an examination pursuant to s 19.
The defendant did in fact attend an examination on 14 July 2005.
However, the examination was adjourned when the defendant said that he wanted to obtain legal advice and representation.
However, on five occasions thereafter, the defendant failed to comply with requirements of the Commission to attend for further examination.
6 Section 70 of the ASIC Act applies where the Commission is satisfied that a person has, without reasonable cause, failed to comply with a requirement under s 19.
Under s 70(2), the Commissioner may certify the failure to the Court and, under s 70(3), if the Commission does so, the Court may, after inquiry into the case, order the person to comply with the requirement as specified in the order.
By instrument dated 11 August 2005, the Commission certified that the defendant had, without reasonable cause, failed on five occasions to comply with such requirements.
Accordingly, for reasons given on 16 September 2005 (see [2005] FCA 1350) , the Court ordered the defendant to appear before three named officers of the Commission at 9 am on 28 September 2005 at ASIC's Sydney office, for examination on oath and to provide the Commission all reasonable assistance with its investigation, pursuant to the notices given by the Commission to the defendant under s 19(2) of the ASIC Act.
7 The orders of 16 September 2005 were duly served on the defendant.
However, on 28 September 2005, a person who said he was a friend of the defendant and who identified himself as 'Michael', whom the defendant subsequently identified as Mr Michael Rappaport, telephoned one of the officers before whom the examination was to take place.
Mr Rappaport told the officer that the defendant was ' depressed ' and would not be attending the examination.
The defendant did not attend ASIC's office on 28 September 2005.
8 Later on that day, the Commission wrote to the defendant enclosing a copy of the orders made on 16 September 2005 and the reasons for those orders.
The letter referred to the telephone call from ' Michael ' and stated that nothing said by him constituted a reasonable excuse for the defendant's non-attendance.
The Commission asserted that the defendant was in contempt of the orders made on 16 September 2005 and said that, if the Commission did not receive some communication from the defendant by 30 September 2005, the Commission may take further action.
Telephone numbers for officers of the Commission were included in the letter.
9 On 30 September 2005, the Commission received a telephone call from Ms Brenda Duchen, who said that she was acting for the defendant and was instructed to accept service of a notice under s 19 of the ASIC Act, requiring the defendant to appear for examination on 6 October 2005.
Such a notice was given to the defendant.
However, on 5 October 2005, the Commission received another telephone call from Mr Rappaport indicating that Ms Duchen was no longer acting for the defendant.
Later in the day, the Commission received a further telephone call from Mr Rappaport, during which he said that the defendant would not be attending any examination on 6 October 2005.
10 On 10 November 2005, the Commission applied, by notice of motion, for orders that the defendant be found guilty of contempt.
The application was returnable before me on 9 December 2005 for directions.
11 On that day, the defendant appeared in person.
When asked whether he had a good reason for not having complied with the Court's orders of 16 September 2005, the defendant said that he was unable to attend the examination for medical reasons.
While he asserted that he had told the Commission about the alleged medical reasons, that was disputed by the Commission.
I informed the defendant that he must realise that he was in very serious trouble and that, if the contempt charge were to be made out, he may be sent to prison.
I told him that, as a citizen, he must abide by the law and must take it seriously in future.
12 The Commission indicated that it was amenable to conducting an examination of the defendant at a mutually convenient time in January 2006.
I therefore fixed the contempt charge for directions on 3 March 2006 and informed the defendant that, if, in the meantime, he had attended an examination at a time that was suitable, that may have a very significant bearing on what would happen with the contempt charge.
13 The defendant, in fact, attended at the Commission's Sydney office on 3 February 2006 and was examined by three officers of the Commission.
However, the Commission and its officers were not satisfied with the extent of co-operation that was received from the defendant in the course of that examination.
14 When the matter came before me again for directions on 3 March 2006, the Commission indicated that it wished to amend the statement of charge to include a complaint that, in addition to failing to appear for examination on 28 September 2005, the defendant did not provide the Commission all reasonable assistance with its investigation at the examination that he attended on 3 February 2006.
An amended statement of charge was subsequently filed and the proceeding was fixed for hearing on 25 May 2006.
15 On 25 May 2006, the defendant again appeared in person and applied for an adjournment of the hearing.
That application was opposed by the Commission.
Ultimately, the defendant proffered an undertaking to the Court that he would appear before named officers of the Commission on 6 June 2006, at the Commission's Sydney office, for examination on oath on enumerated topics and that he would provide the Commission with all reasonable assistance with its investigation of those topics.
The topics were as follows:
 
 
 'i.
The defendant's personal details, including but not limited to employment status; 
 ii.
The defendant's current and past financial position; 
 iii.
The defendant's knowledge and understanding of securities  derivatives markets and trading; 
 iv.
The defendant's dealings with Macquarie Bank; 
 v. The defendant's dealings with stock brokers; 
 vi.
The defendant's trading in securities and derivatives in 2004 and 2005; 
 vii.
The defendant's relationships with associates; 
 viii The defendant's dealings with the [the Commission] ' 
 

 Accordingly, after noting the defendant's undertaking, I vacated the hearing and fixed the matter for hearing on 9 August 2006.
16 The defendant attended an examination at the Commission's offices on 6 June 2006.
He was represented by counsel and solicitor and answered questions put by the Commission's officers.
Once again, however, the Commission and its officers were not satisfied with the degree of co-operation received from the defendant in answering questions.
17 When the proceeding was called on for hearing on 9 August 2006, the defendant appeared by counsel and solicitor.
At the commencement of the hearing, without objection from the defendant, a further amended statement of charge was filed, adding the third charge, relating to the examination on 6 June 2006.
The defendant was cross-examined by counsel for the Commission.
18 In the course of the hearing, counsel for the defendant sought leave to rely upon an affidavit sworn on 8 August 2006 by Dr Claudia Nicholson, a general medical practitioner.
The affidavit related to consultations of Dr Nicholson by the defendant in April 2004 and on 14 February 2006 and 5 March 2006.
Copies of Dr Nicholson's clinical notes were annexed to the affidavit.
19 Also annexed to the affidavit of Dr Nicholson was a report by Dr Nicholson dated 5 March 2006 and addressed ' To Whom it May Concern '.
In the report, Dr Nicholson said that she believes that the defendant suffers from episodes of panic attacks and that, as panic attacks can be quite debilitating, that is a valid medical reason for the defendant being incapacitated on the morning of a failed court attendance.
Dr Nicholson did not refer to any particular failed court attendance in the report.
20 Counsel for the Commission objected to any reliance on the affidavit unless Dr Nicholson were available for cross-examination.
On the defendant's application, therefore, I adjourned the hearing of the proceeding and gave leave for the issue of a subpoena to Dr Nicholson requiring her to attend Court to give oral evidence.
The matter was fixed for further hearing on 25 October 2006.
21 Although a subpoena was issued, Dr Nicholson did not attend Court on 25 October 2006.
My Associate received a message from Dr Nicholson indicating that she had been unable to communicate with the solicitor who had the subpoena issued and would, therefore, not be able to attend Court.
In the circumstances, I did not permit the defendant to rely on Dr Nicholson's evidence.
22 Counsel who appeared for the defendant on 25 October 2006 sought a further adjournment on the basis that he had only been instructed less than 48 hours before the hearing.
The Commission opposed any further adjournment.
However, the Commission did not oppose counsel being given an opportunity to make written submissions on behalf of the defendant.
I therefore gave directions for written submissions to be made on behalf of the defendant and the Commission.
I have now received written submissions from both, but limited to the question of whether the defendant is guilty of contempt as charged.
Any question of penalty is to be dealt with only if I find the charges proved.
THE CHARGES 
 
23 Contempt consists of the wilful disobedience of a court order.
The disobedience must be wilful in the sense that it is not casual, accidental or unintentional.
The same principle applies in relation to the breach of an undertaking given to the Court.
That is to say, wilful breach of an undertaking given to the Court would be contempt if the breach was not casual, accidental or unintentional.
Putting it another way, the breach of the order of the Court or an undertaking to the Court must be contumacious, as being wilful and obstinate disobedience involving insult to, or defiance of, the Court.
24 The particulars of the charges of contempt, as contained in the further amended statement of charge, are as follows:
 
 1.
The Defendant knowingly, and in wilful and contumacious disregard of the orders made on 16 September 2005, did not appear for examination on oath before officers of the Commission on 28 September 2005; 
 2.
The defendant knowingly, and in wilful and contumacious disregard of the orders made on 16 September 2005, did not provide the Commission all reasonable assistance with its investigation in that the defendant failed to answer questions, and/or alternatively, provide information according to the defendant's knowledge, recollection and/or belief, in response to questions by examiners, on the following matters.
