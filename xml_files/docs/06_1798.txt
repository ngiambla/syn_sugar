 
1 The applicants are a family of two parents and three daughters who are citizens of Fiji.
The lease on the land which they farmed in Fiji was due to expire in around 2001.
In 1997, local indigenous Fijians who claimed that they owned the land began harassing them.
The worst incident, which later resulted in the applicants paying money to the men who harassed them, was reported to the local police who did nothing.
Despite those men agreeing to conditions for an extension to the lease, the harassment did not cease.
2 After the applicants came to Australia, they were notified that their land had been leased to someone else.
They took no steps to protest or to seek compensation for improvements made by them.
Country information stated that farmers whose leases were not renewed could seek compensation and that government assistance in obtaining new land or other employment was available.
3 The applicants expressed fear of further harassment from the men who had previously harassed them at their farm.
They also expressed fear of other indigenous Fijians.
4 The Refugee Review Tribunal was not satisfied, on the basis of these matters, that the applicants had a well-founded fear of persecution.
The applicants sought judicial review of that decision in the Federal Magistrates Court.
Emmett FM dismissed their application ( SZEIV v Minister for Immigration  Anor [2005] FMCA 1702) and the applicants seek to appeal her Honour's decision in this Court.
The Tribunal's findings and reasons 
 
5 The Tribunal accepted the claims of harassment but, as the applicants were no longer in possession of the land and the harassment was to make them leave the land, the Tribunal did not accept that there was a real chance that this harassment would continue if they returned to Fiji.
The Tribunal contended that, in ' the unlikely event ' that the harassment continued, they could relocate to another part of the country.
The Tribunal said that while the termination of the lease may have been a discriminatory act, it did not constitute serious harm amounting to persecution.
6 The Tribunal cited country information that, despite general levels of violence and crime in Fiji, people of Indian ethnicity are not generally at risk of serious harm amounting to persecution because of racial violence.
The Tribunal was not satisfied that the applicants were owed protection obligations under the Refugees Convention as amended by the Refugees Protocol.
The judgment of the Federal Magistrate 
 
7 Emmett FM summarised the claims as set out in the Tribunal decision and also the detail of the claims set out in written submissions furnished by the applicants' solicitor to the Delegate as well as the matters set out in the application for a protection visa (at [4] to [11]).
In the written submissions before the Delegate, the claim was that the male applicant's ' fundamental civil and political rights ' were breached by reason of race, in that the government in Fiji ' preferred the lawful [sic] interests and the illegal conduct of the traditional land holders '.
8 In the application for a protection visa, the loss of land was described and persecution on account of race was specified.
There was also reference to the male applicant's active support and membership of the Labour Party.
This was related to his being ' victimised by the native land owners for the reclaimanation [sic] of land '.
9 The applicants were represented by counsel before her Honour.
