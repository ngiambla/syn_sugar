 EDMONDS J: 
 
 INTRODUCTION 
 
1 This case concerns the construction of s 255 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (Cth) ('the ITAA 1936') and s 260 -5 of Schedule 1 to the Taxation Administration Act 1953 (Cth) ('the Administration Act') and the application of those provisions to various parties by service of notices by the Deputy Commissioner in reliance on them.
2 Section 255 of the ITAA 1936 provides a regime for the collection of income tax from non-residents by empowering the Commissioner to require a person having the receipt, control or disposal of money belonging to a non-resident to pay the tax due and payable by the non-resident.
Communication of such a requirement to a person triggers an authority and further requirement in the person in respect of money which comes to him on behalf of the non-resident.
3 Section 260-5 of Schedule 1 to the Administration Act provides a regime for the collection of income tax from any entity, resident or non-resident, by empowering the Commissioner to require a third party which owes or may later owe money to the entity to pay to the Commissioner the whole or part of that money.
4 An analysis of the relevant provisions of s 255 of the ITAA 1936 and s 260-5 of Schedule 1 to the Administration Act is undertaken later in these reasons.
5 Underlying the current dispute is the substantive dispute between ECMI and the Deputy Commissioner as to whether ECMI is liable to pay Australian income tax on the capital gain it made on the sales of shares in Gribbles, as the Deputy Commissioner claims, or whether Australia is denied the right to tax that gain by virtue of the provisions of Article 7 of the Double Taxation Agreement between Australia and Belgium (Schedules 13 and 13A to the International Tax Agreement Act 1953 (Cth)), as ECMI claims: See generally 'Treaty Protection from Capital Gains Tax' by Ian V Gzell QC, (2000) 29 Australian Tax Review , 25 --- 49; by the same author, 'Treaty Application to a Capital Gains Tax introduced after Conclusion of the Treaty', (2002) 76 Australian Law Journal , 309 --- 327.
In this regard, objections to the assessment and amended assessment referred to later in these reasons have not been determined and the substantive issue remains live for another day.

BACKGROUND 
 
8 To a large extent, the factual background is not in dispute.
9 Prior to 2 November 2004 ECMI beneficially owned 194,516,455 ordinary shares ('the Shares') in Gribbles, representing 43.05 per cent of the issued ordinary shares in Gribbles.
At the time, the ordinary shares in Gribbles were listed on the Australian Stock Exchange ('ASX').
ANZ Nominees was the registered holder of the Shares as trustee for ECMI and ANZ Bank was mortgagee of the Shares.
10 Prior to 2 November 2004 Healthscope announced that it proposed to make a takeover bid for all the shares in Gribbles at $0.60 per share.
11 On or about 2 November 2004 ECMI announced that if ---
 
 (1) by 5.00 pm on 3 November 2004 Healthscope agreed to acquire 44 million Gribbles shares (representing 9.8 per cent of all the Gribbles shares) from ECMI at $0.63 per share; 


 
 (2) as a consequence, Healthscope increased the amount of its takeover bid price from $0.60 to $0.63 per Gribbles share; and 


 
 (3) Healthscope commenced despatch of its bidder's statement to Gribbles shareholders by 12 November 2004, 


ECMI would procure the acceptance of Healthscope's takeover bid for all the remaining 150,516,455 Gribbles shares beneficially owned by ECMI on 17 November 2004.
12 On 3 November 2004 Healthscope acquired 44 million shares in Gribbles from ECMI at $0.63 per share pursuant to a share acquisition agreement.
That agreement acknowledged ECMI's public announcement relating, inter alia , to ' the proposed dealing by [ECMI] with the remainder of the [Gribbles] shares of which [ECMI] is the beneficial owner' (cl 6(b)) .

 
13 On 3 November 2004 ECMI's mortgage to the ANZ Bank was discharged from the proceeds of sale of the 44 million Gribbles shares.
14 By letter dated 8 November 2004 the Australian Taxation Office ('ATO') sent to the Public Officer of Healthscope a notice under s 255 of the ITAA 1936 ('the 8 November 2004 Notice').
15 On 9 November 2004 Healthscope issued a takeover offer to the shareholders of Gribbles.
16 On 15 November 2004 ECMI entered into a nominee agreement with Investec Trustees providing for securities to be registered in the name of Investec Trustees or in the name of a sub-custodian appointed by Investec Trustees.
17 On 15 November 2004 Investec Trustees instructed ANZ Nominees to transfer 150,515,455 ordinary shares in Gribbles to the account of CSC 'with a trade and settlement date of 16 November, 2004'.
18 On 16 November 2004 ANZ Nominees confirmed that the transfer of the 150,515,455 ordinary shares in Gribbles to the account of CSC had been completed as instructed.
19 On 17 November 2004 five share sale agreements were entered into between ECMI, on the one hand, and each of Elsinora, Tioga, Perlette, Mr Armstrong and Mr Berger, on the other.
Those agreements included the following conditions:
 
 (1) Each of Elsinora, Tioga and Perlette agreed to purchase from ECMI part of the remaining 150,516,455 Gribbles shares at $0.6237 per share (cl 1.1.5), that is, 0.63 cents per share less than the price of $0.63 per share to be paid by Healthscope to ANZ Nominees.
(2) Each of Mr Armstrong and Mr Berger agreed to purchase from ECMI part of the remaining 150,516,455 Gribbles shares at $0.625 per share (cl 1.1.5), that is, 0.5 cents per share less than the price of $0.63 per share to be paid by Healthscope to ANZ Nominees.
(3) Completion was to occur after Healthscope had paid for the remaining 150,516,455 Gribbles shares (cl 1.1.3).
(4) Each of Elsinora, Tioga, Perlette, Mr Armstrong and Mr Berger agreed to purchase the remaining 150,516,455 Gribbles shares for the purpose of selling on to Healthscope (Recital C) and agreed forthwith to accept Healthscope's bid for Gribbles shares (cl 2.5 and Third Schedule in which instructions are given to Investec Trustees as custodian, and CSC and ANZ Nominees as sub-custodian for Investec Trustees to accept Healthscope's bid for the Gribbles shares the subject of the agreement).
(5) On completion each of Elsinora, Tioga, Perlette, Mr Armstrong and Mr Berger agreed to pay the consideration to ECMI by such method as the parties agreed (cl 3.3).


20 At the same time ECMI and Elsinora, Tioga, Perlette, Mr Armstrong and Mr Berger entered into put option agreements, the effect of which was to grant power to Elsinora, Tioga, Perlette, Mr Armstrong and Mr Berger to require ECMI to re-purchase the Gribbles shares if Healthscope did not proceed with the takeover.
21 On 17 November 2004 Mr Armstrong and Mr Berger opened trustee accounts with Investec Trustees.
Investec Trustees became the custodian of the Gribbles shares acquired by each of Mr Armstrong and Mr Berger.
Investec Trustees appointed CSC as sub-custodian of the shares which Investec Trustees held as custodian for each of Mr Armstrong and Mr Berger.
22 On 17 November 2004 each of Elsinora, Tioga and Perlette passed resolutions to appoint CSC as custodian of the Gribbles shares acquired by each of them and to open an account with CSC.
The shares were transferred into the relevant CSC account on 17 November 2004.
23 By virtue of these events:
 
 (a) Investec Trustees ceased to hold any shares as custodian or nominee for ECMI.
(b) CSC held 90 million shares as custodian for Elsinora, Tioga and Perlette.
(c) CSC held 60,576,455 shares as sub-custodian for Investec Trustees.
(d) Investec Trustees held 60,576,455 shares, in an account with CSC, as custodian for Mr Armstrong and Mr Berger.


24 On 17 November 2004:
 
 (a) Mr Armstrong and Mr Berger instructed Investec Trustees to contact CSC to release the shares to accept the takeover offer.
(b) Investec Trustees instructed CSC to release the shares to Healthscope's custodian in acceptance of Healthscope's takeover offer.
(c) Elsinora, Tioga and Perlette instructed CSC to release the shares to Healthscope's custodian in acceptance of Healthscope's takeover offer.


25 On 23 November 2004 the Australian Government Solicitor ('AGS'), as solicitors for the Deputy Commissioner, wrote to Healthscope acknowledging that 'subsequent information obtained from the Australian Stock Exchange suggests that ECMI has sold its beneficial interest in the 150,516,455 ordinary shares in Gribbles to the following parties [Elsinora, Tioga, Perlette, Mr Armstrong and Mr Berger]'.
The letter goes on to state in par 5:
 
 'Our client considers any monies to be paid by Healthscope to the above named parties [being a reference to Elsinora, Tioga, Perlette, Mr Armstrong and Mr Berger] will be subject to the operation of the section 255 Notice.
Accordingly, Healthscope continues to be a person having the receipt control or disposal of money belonging to ECMI and is expected to comply with the terms of the section 255 Notice.
' 
 

26 On 25 November 2004 Healthscope responded indicating its view that the 8 November 2004 Notice might be invalid.
On 29 November 2004, the AGS replied expressing the view that the Notice was valid and pointing out:
 
 'Our client has formed the view that any monies to be paid by Healthscope Limited for the acquisition of the 150,516,455 ordinary shares in The Gribbles Group Limited belongs to ECMI, a non-resident.
' 
 

27 On 1 December 2004, the Commissioner assessed ECMI to income tax of $9,953,426.10 by issue of a notice of assessment under s 168 of the ITAA 1936, assessing tax payable by ECMI, said to be capital gains tax in the amount of $9,953.426.10 payable on 1 December 2005.
ECMI received the notice of assessment on or about 15 December 2004.
28 On 9 December 2004 the Board of Directors of Investec Trustees resolved that 'an account for Investec Trustees (UK) Limited be opened with Investec Bank (UK) Limited'.
It was further resolved that 'Accounts specifically entitled "Investec Trustees (UK) Limited re EC Medical Investments NV" be established with Investec Bank (UK) Limited'.
29 On 21 December 2004 the Healthscope takeover offer became unconditional.
It thereupon became liable to pay ANZ Nominees $0.63 per share for the remaining 150,516,455 Gribbles shares, being the sum of $94,825,366.65.
30 By letter dated 24 December 2004, the ATO sent to the Public Officer of Healthscope a further 'notice in respect of section 255 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 ' ('the 24 December 2004 Notice').
31 By letter dated 7 January 2005, the ATO sent to the Public Officer of ANZ Nominees a 'notice in respect of Section 255 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 ' ('the 7 January 2005 Notice').
32 On 19 January 2005 an account was opened for Elsinora, Tioga, Perlette, Mr Armstrong and Mr Berger with Investec Bank (Channel Islands) Limited to receive the proceeds of the sale by those persons of the Gribbles shares to Healthscope.
This account was designated 'Investec Trustees (UK) Limited 81/S4513000'.
33 On 20 January 2005 the Deputy Commissioner wrote to ANZ Nominees informing it that Healthscope had agreed to retain the sum of $9,953,426.10 and that ANZ Nominees did not need to retain that amount under the 7 January 2005 Notice.
34 Under cover of letter dated 21 January 2005 from Allens Arthur Robinson, Melbourne, to ANZ Nominees two cheques were sent on behalf of Healthscope in payment of the consideration payable by Healthscope under the offer for the acquisition of the remaining Gribbles shares less the amount of $9,953,426.10 retained by Healthscope.
35 On 21 January 2005 CSC received from ANZ Nominees an amount of $84,871,940.55.
This amount represented the proceeds of sale of the remaining Gribbles shares less the sum of $9,953,426.10 retained by Healthscope.
The amount of $84,871,940.55 was credited to four accounts: one for each of Elsinora, Tioga, Perlette and one for Investec Trustees, for Mr Armstrong and Mr Berger.
36 On 21 January 2005 a notice of amended assessment was issued to ECMI.
The amounts of taxable income, tax payable pursuant to the assessment and due date did not change from those in the notice of assessment issued on 1 December 2004 ([27] supra).
37 On 24 January 2005 Investec Bank (Channel Islands) Limited received an amount of $84,871,940.55 from CSC into the account named Investec Trustees (UK) Limited 81/S4513000.
