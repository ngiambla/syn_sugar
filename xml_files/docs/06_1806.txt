Australasian Mechanical Copyright Owners Society Limited controls in Australia the right to reproduce certain musical works.
APRA administers licences issued by AMCOS.
Between them, APRA and AMCOS own or control the right in Australia to communicate to the public or reproduce many works which are the subject of copyright under the Copyright Act 1968 (Cth).
2 In mid 2003 Monster Communications Pty Limited began a business of providing downloads of copyright works to mobile telephone customers through the use of telephone services provided by Telstra Corporation Limited and other telecommunications licensed carriers.
Among other services that Monster has provided are downloads of monophonic and polyphonic ringtones.
And, from late 2005 until June 2006 Monster also provided a service to its customers where they could download what are known as MP3 files onto their mobile phones.
3 Monster advertised its services nationally.
The advertisements invited consumers to acquire downloads from Monster either by sending a short message service (known as SMS) text message or by making an interactive voice response (IVR) telephone call to a 1900 telephone number.
Customers access the SMS services by sending a text message from their mobile phone to a telephone number together with a code requesting a particular product download.
When the SMS message is received, Monster's telecommunications service provider processes the request by sending it to Monster and collects or arranges to collect Monster's advertised price from its customer.
Next, Monster processes the request through its computer systems.
The end result is that the consumer receives on the screen of his or her mobile phone a download of what was ordered: viz; a monophonic, polyphonic or MP3 ringtone, a colour message or a picture.
4 Customers access the IVR services by telephoning the 1900 number and progressing through a series of steps during the call with similar end results.
In addition, if the customer makes an IVR call, he or she can place more than one order for downloads of any of Monster's advertised products.
A telecommunications agreement between Monster and Telstra for IVR calls was in place between June 2003 and 1 May 2005.
It provided that the first 24 seconds of any IVR call were free and thereafter the call was charged to Monster at an agreed rate.
Monster's advertisements informed consumers of their ability to order more than one of its advertised download products in the same 1900 call.
The advertisements made an offer that if the consumer ordered three downloads, he or she would get one free (with no limits and in any combination).
5 When a customer ordered a ringtone or image download through either the SMS or IVR services, Monster reproduced the image or ringtone thus attracting the royalties to which AMCOS is entitled.
Each of Monster and its telecommunications service provider then communicated the ringtone or image download to the consumer thus generating the royalties to which APRA is entitled.
In both cases the royalties became payable in respect of works the copyright in which either APRA or AMCOS controlled or APRA owned.
6 Ringtone services have developed into an important market for APRA and AMOCS since the year ended 30 June 2002, when they had 18 licensees.
In subsequent years the numbers grew, peaking at 62 in the year ended 30 June 2004.
There were 49 in the year ended 30 June 2005.
As at 30 June 2006 there were 47 licensees although there had been 56 current at one point during that year.
7 Licensees are required to produce to APRA and AMCOS their telephone service provider statements of account.
Those statements record, among other information, that total revenue collected by the provider from customers downloading licensees' ringtones and other services and the net amounts remitted to the ringtone licensee from those collections.
Each licensee makes a return to APRA or AMCOS identifying what part of the revenues disclosed in the providers' statements are attributable to downloads of licensed works.
A calculation is then made of the royalties due.
Based on returns prepared by the licensees under their agreements with APRA and AMCOS, they calculated that, on their estimate, Monster's share of revenue from the ringtone services market in Australia was in the order of 8% of the market.
8 Shortly after Monster commenced its business in July 2003, it became aware that it was obliged to obtain licences from APRA and AMCOS for many of the copyright works used in its business.
After some long negotiations, the parties entered into four different agreements dated 1 January 2005 which took effect as from 1 July 2003 for the IVR licences (cl 3) and 1 October 2004 for the SMS licences (cl 3) so as to provide for royalties during the preceding, as well as future, periods.
Monster entered into an agreement with each of APRA and AMCOS respectively for the provision of IVR services and SMS services.
Apart from the identity of the parties to each agreement, the relevant provisions of each IVR agreement and each SMS agreement were, in many respects, materially similar although there were some substantial differences.
9 In August 2005 APRA and AMCOS terminated the IVR licences for non-payment of interim invoices for royalties.
Those invoices were issued after an audit by Deloitte of Monster's financial information following Monster's failure to provide to APRA and AMCOS relevant financial information under their IVR licences.
The SMS licences were terminated in December 2005 because of Monster's failure to provide any statements from its telecommunications service providers from which royalties could be calculated.
During the period covered by each of the licences before their termination, Monster paid no royalties at all.
Subsequently Monster paid some royalties.
10 Monster's records were audited by Deloitte.
The audit revealed substantial deficiencies in and unreliability of Monster's records.
Monster's financial records for 9 May 2005 evince a very significant, two-thirds, decline at midnight on that date in the number of downloads it provided (i.e.
from about 37,000 in its previous records to, about 13,000) (T 192.6) from which it never recovered.
The expert evidence said there was no explanation for that fall or its magnitude.
11 Monster argued that APRA and AMCOS had failed to provide it with any specification of the financial information they required under each of the SMS and IVR licences and that accordingly, it was not in breach of any obligation under them.
Monster argued that the termination of each of the licences was invalid.
The parties entered into negotiations for the grant of new IVR licences to take effect immediately following the termination of the original ones.
Monster argued that it was able effectively to accept that offer three months after it had been made in circumstances where, in the interim, the SMS licences had also been terminated and APRA and AMCOS were threatening to take it to court if it did not pay a substantial sum for past royalties.
Monster has continued to provide downloads of copyright works relying on its argument that the terminations of each of the licences were invalid.
12 The construction of the SMS and IVR licences, and in particular the formulae for the payment of royalties, is at the heart of the present proceedings.
APRA and AMCOS contend that Monster has not accounted properly for the royalties which are due under the IVR and SMS licences.
Monster contends that it has in fact overpaid those royalties.
RINGTONES 
 
13 A ringtone is a fragment of a musical work in digital form which is intended to be delivered to and to function as the ring of a mobile telephone: Re Powercom Interactive Media Pty Ltd (2003) 175 FLR 1 at 3 [9] per Lindgren P. The President found that in storing ringtones on its computers, a ringtone supplier makes a reproduction of those parts of the musical works embodied in the ringtones for the purposes of s 31(1)(a)(i) of the Copyright Act 1968 (Cth).
In electronically transmitting ringtones to a mobile telephone, the ringtone supplier exercises the right of communication to the public in respect of those parts of the musical works embodied in the ringtones (s 31(1)(a)(iv) of the Act: s 10(1) contains a definition of the word 'communicate' as meaning to 'make available online or electronically transmit ... a work or other subject matter').
By providing an IVR service, a ringtone supplier authorizes the making of the copy of the ringtones which are created in the customer's mobile telephones upon electronic transmission of them (for the purposes of s 36 of the Act) (175 FLR at 4 [11]-[13]).
THE SMS LICENCES 
 
14 Relevantly, each of the SMS licences dated 1 January 2005 is in identical terms, except for the fees payable under Schedule 1, the identity of the licensors and an extra clause in the AMCOS version regulating reproduction of musical works (cl 5).
Each SMS licence commenced on 1 October 2004 (cl 3).
APRA was entitled to a fee for monophonic or polyphonic format ringtones of 1.1% (inclusive of GST) of the retail price subject to a minimum fee of 1.65cents (inclusive of GST) per sale.
The fee for phonographic format (i.e.
MP3) ringtones was 2.2% (inclusive of GST) of the retail price subject to a minimum fee of $3.30 per sale.
At all times, Monster charged consumers, according to its advertisements $3.50 per ringtone downloaded via an SMS service.
15 AMCOS was entitled to a fixation fee of $11 in respect of each new AMCOS work added to the licensee's inventory in the quarter for which the fees were payable.
In addition, the licensee had to pay AMCOS a fee for each ringtone of 11% inclusive of GST of the retail price subject to a minimum fee of 16.5cents (inclusive of GST) per sale.
16 Each SMS licence recited the capacity in which the relevant licensor acted.
APRA owned or controlled for Australia the exclusive right of public performance and communication to the public in relation to the relevant work (Recital A).
AMCOS controlled in Australia the right to reproduce the AMCOS works (Recital A).
The licensee was described as being in the business of providing customised mobile telephone ringtones for sale 'at a fixed rate per sale ... by means of premium rate short message services ... and/or through the proprietary networks of telecommunication carriers' (Recital B).
The licence then recited that the licensee required a licence from the relevant licensor to pursue that business activity.
17 The licensee was required to pay the licence fee calculated in accordance with the formula set out in schedule 1 (cl 4).
The AMCOS SMS licence contained a clause 5 which was not in the APRA equivalent.
That clause required the licensee to notify AMCOS within 14 days of the date of the agreement of the names of the ringtones it wished to reproduce (cl 5.2).
18 Monster was required, within 14 days after the end of each quarter, to provide to the licensor the revenue and music use information described in schedule 2 in the form 'prescribed by [the licensor] from time to time' (APRA cl 5, AMCOS cl 6).
The licensee was required to keep accurate books of account and other records in sufficient detail to ensure that all amounts payable to the licensor under the agreement could be properly ascertained (cl 7).
19 Each SMS licence contained a provision entitling APRA (cl 10.1(a)) and AMCOS (cl 11.1(a)) to terminate it immediately by notice if Monster breached any term of the licence and failed to remedy the breach within 7 days of being required to do so.
20 In Schedule 2, each SMS licence required the licensee to supply within 14 days after the end of each quarter a detailed account of ringtone sales in that quarter for each separate ringtone service operated by the licensee, which was defined as a sales report.
The sales report had to identify for each separate work offered for sale during the quarter among other things the title of the work, identifying whether the work was an APRA or AMCOS work or not and the price at which it was sold.
Critically, Schedule 2 went on to provide:
 
 'In a format acceptable to [the licensor] , the licensee must also supply [to the licensor] within 30 days after the end of each Quarter, copies of actual revenue statements (including but not limited to details of items delivered, items billed, gross revenue, price points and period covered as relevant) provided by the relevant telecommunications carriers and service providers responsible for collecting revenue in relation to the Purpose.
' 
 

The schedule concluded that if the price of a particular ringtone changed during each quarter or it was sold at different prices, then separate line entries were required to be made for each price so that a correct licence fee could be calculated.
THE IVR LICENCES 
 
21 Each IVR licence had provided that the licensee had to a licence fee calculated in accordance with a formula set out in schedule 1 (cl 4).
As with the SMS licences, the AMCOS licence alone contained a cl 5 in similar terms to the AMCOS SMS licence.
The licensee, as with the SMS licences, within 14 days after the end of each quarter had to provide the licensor with the revenue and music use information described in schedule 2 in the form prescribed by the licensor from time to time (APRA cl 5, AMCOS cl 6).
22 On receipt by the licensor of the information under cl 5 or cl 6, the licensor had to calculate the licence fee for the quarter in accordance with cl 4 (APRA cl 6.1, AMCOS cl 7.1).
The licensee was then required to pay any invoice issued by the licensor within 14 days after the date of invoice.
However, if the licensor received information pursuant to an audit or examination which could be required under cl 8 (or cl 9 for AMCOS), it was entitled to issue an invoice for any additional licence fee payable and the licensee had to pay that invoice within 14 days after its date (APRA cl 6.3, AMCOS cl 7.3).
The licensee was again required to keep accurate books of account and other records in sufficient detail to ensure that all amounts payable to the licensor under the agreement could be properly ascertained (APRA cl 7, AMCOS cl 8).
23 Each IVR licence contained a termination clause in the same terms as the SMS licences (APRA cl 10, AMCOS cl 11).
24 Schedule 1 of the IVR licences provided for a formula for the payment of fees.
In each formula, the APRA call revenue and AMCOS call revenue were defined as 'ACR'.
ACR was calculated by multiplying what was defined as NCR (net call revenue) by the fraction comprised of the total number downloads of the licensors' works by the total number of downloads delivered by the IVR service.
Relevantly, where, as is common ground here, the average price per ringtone was greater than $1.50, the licensee had to pay APRA a licence fee for monophonic ringtones of 1.1%, and for polyphonic ones 2.2% of the APRA call revenue (inclusive of GST) (Schedule 1, 2/105).
Under the AMCOS agreement the licence fee, where the average price per ringtone was greater than $1.50, was 11% of the AMCOS call revenue (inclusive of GST).
25 The calculation in Schedule 1 was designed to identify the proportion of works within the control of APRA and AMCOS respectively in the overall revenue generated by the operations of the licensee.
NCR was defined as meaning the gross call revenue 'less bad debts actually written off and less the connection fee actually charged by the telecommunication service provider responsible for providing the carriage of the IVR service'.
Gross call revenue was defined as meaning the gross earnings of the licensee together with the earnings of any or all of its agents, partners, affiliates and income sharers (including without limitation any telecommunications company or service provider or bureau) directly or indirectly receivable during the quarter in respect of or otherwise in relation to the IVR service.
26 Thus, the concept behind gross call revenue was to capture the charge which the telecommunications company made its subscriber pay when accessing and arranging downloads from Monster's services.
Consumers would be billed by or have payments deducted from their accounts by their telecommunications services provider.
Thus, a consumer wishing to purchase a download from a Monster advertisement would telephone a 1900 number for an IVR service.
Telstra provided Monster with the 1900 numbers.
Not all Monster's customers were, however, Telstra customers.
Thus, Telstra would have to collect, from the customers or their telecommunications providers, the money which Monster advertised was the cost of the relevant download.
Telstra and Monster entered into a contract for the provision of the IVR services in June 2003.
THE TEMPLATE DISPUTE 
 
27 Mr Richard Mallett has worked for APRA for about 10 years and has been APRA's director of mechanical licensing since early 2002.
He has had extensive experience in the licensing activities of APRA and AMCOS.
He first became aware of Monster's activities in about August 2003 and was the officer of APRA and AMCOS responsible for dealings with Monster.
28 Mr Jansen Chong (the second respondent) is Monster's sole director.
He graduated a Bachelor of Laws with Honours from the University of Warwick in the United Kingdom in 1991.
During the course of that degree he gained some understanding of intellectual property matters.
Between 1993 and 1996 he held the rank of Inspector with the Singapore Police Force and performed both investigative and staff functions.
After he left the Singapore Police Force he held positions as marketing and strategic development manager with a number of companies that introduced him to the download technology that Monster uses in its business.
From January 2002 for about a year he was the general manger of Powercom which carries on a business in Australia similar to that of Monster.
He was in charge of Powercom's marketing delivery systems.
While there, he improved its ringtone products and developed graphic products to add to its principal business being a provider of chat room services.
After leaving Powercom Mr Chong established Monster and commenced business in July 2003.
29 On 20 January 2005 Mr Mallett and two other representatives of APRA and AMCOS had a meeting during the course of which Mr Chong said that Monster could not provide sales figures for the last 18 months.
Mr Mallett responded that he was sure that they could come up with a commercial solution to that problem.
Discussion turned to the reporting requirements under APRA's standard form licence agreements.
Mr Mallett said that APRA and AMCOS did not currently require some of the information that was referred to in Schedule 2, including the unique identifying numbers for works and IVR numbers.
He said that APRA and AMCOS would make the calculation of net call revenue directly from the Telstra statements and that Monster did not need to provide additional supporting information.
30 Mr Mallett said at that time APRA and AMCOS did not have a fixed or prescribed format in their electronic data interchange (EDI) specification that they would send to Monster later that day.
He said that those specifications were due to come into force in September 2005 and that some items in Schedule 2 (in the IVR licences) including identifying numbers and IVR numbers were not required for the moment.
He told Mr Chong that in the meantime sales information should be provided in electronic format and they would work with Monster.
Mr Mallett said that APRA and AMCOS would make the calculation of net call revenue directly from the Telstra statements and that Monster did not need to provide additional supporting information.
Later that day Mr Mallett sent a letter to Mr Chong attaching the draft EDI specification which he said he was assured by the technicians made sense to them.
The letter said that they expected the first reports to be in the format of the draft for the July-September quarter.
31 In his evidence, Mr Mallett agreed that the letter of 20 January 2005 conveyed that the template was a draft and that there would be no mandatory requirement till later that year (T 101.21-.25).
He said the template in the EDI specification which was sent on 20 January 2005 by APRA and AMCOS to Monster was to be used as a form of guide as to how the specification should be completed (T 99.25-100.42).
32 On 11 February 2005 Mr Chong wrote to Mr Mallett.
He enclosed copies of the IVR and SMS licences executed by Monster.
In the letter Mr Chong requested a template from APRA/AMCOS of the correct layout required for the detailed sales report and information which Monster had to provide under the licence agreements.
Mr Chong then set out what he called a detailed sales report for the quarter ending 30 September 2003.
That simply listed the number of sales of mono and polyphonic ringtones for each of the three months.
He also asked for the correct or accepted format with which to provide additional data, such as the song titles and artists, in order to be able to calculate the royalties due.
33 On the same day, APRA and AMCOS's solicitors (Banki Haddock Fiora) wrote to Monster's then solicitors (Griffith Hack Lawyers) noting that Monster had provided signed licence agreements relating to the ringtone service which Monster offered together with some sales information in relation to the September 2003 quarter.
They said that Monster had not provided any revenue information.
They drew attention to Monster's failure to provide, as required by each licence agreement, full details of sales of ringtones, including statements from telecommunication service providers.
Banki Haddock Fiora also asserted that Monster's licence fee obligations were significant.
They said it was expected to comply with the agreements.
34 Between 11 February 2005 and early March 2005 Mr Chong and Mr Mallett had at least one and possibly more conversations to the following effect (T 102.15-.30):
 
 
 
 'Mr Chong: Richard, I need to know the format and information you need from me to supply you with the quarterly reports.
I also need you to tell me which of the ringtones are APRA/AMCOS works.

 
 Mr Mallett: Don't worry about that.
We'll give you something.
We'll give you a format later this year.
You just provide all your sales figures and Telstra revenue returns.
' 
 
 
 

35 After this conversation APRA/AMCOS sent an email on 4 March 2005 to Mr Chong noting that they had processed the licence agreements and they were sending a copy of the executed versions in the mail.
The email continued:
 
 'We have attached a Digital Download Sales Reporting guide and an example EDI [electronic data interchange] template which labels each field as required under our EDI specifications.
Please complete and return as soon as possible'.
(emphasis added)
 

Although the attachment clearly showed that the status of the document was a draft, the template format which it contained had a detailed description of what was required for reporting download transactions.
That included descriptive explanations of mandatory fields in the template and of information to be provided (such as the record type, work title, the writers, the performers and the quantity.
Optional items included certain reference information identifying the downloaded work).
36 All other licensees of APRA and AMCOS have conformed to these requirements and reported without difficulty.
37 Mr Chong read the material in the email of 4 March, as he had the material with the letter of 20 January 2005, when he received them (T 133.8).
38 Mr Chong said that he did not want to give APRA or AMCOS a bare list of sales and core revenues from which they would unilaterally determine licence fees and in circumstances where he would not have any idea what figure they might determine was payable.
After receiving both EDI documents, he said that he was concerned that they were both drafts which might change and that they appeared to describe a system specification to allow interchange of information electronically between APRA and AMCOS and its licensees such as Monster.
39 Mr Chong also asserted that the fact that these documents were drafts was significant to him because Monster's computer software would have to be altered to enable it to access the data and produce the specified reports.
That would entail a cost and, he asserted, more importantly the testing of Monster's systems after they had been altered to ensure that the required changes did not create bugs or damage any part of the system.
He also expressed concern that an alteration of the computer system to accommodate a draft specification created the real possibility that if the final specification differed, there would have to be a subsequent alteration at additional cost and with additional testing procedures.
He understood that it was a computer industry rule and standard that computer systems not be altered by reference to draft specifications for those reasons.
40 Mr Chong was taken through the draft EDI specification attached to the email of 4 March 2005 in cross-examination.
He was asked about his concerns to do with the draft EDI format by being taken to the requirements for different fields individually.
For example, he was asked about whether he knew enough about the systems to know what a header row was.
Mr Chong said that he did not know because APRA and AMCOS had never discussed it with him and he did not recognise the acronym 'HDR' as a symbol for the header row (T 132.45-133.5).
When he was taken to the descriptive definition in the draft EDI specification, it was clear that the acronym referred to a file header record comprising seven fields of mandatory information identifying with precision what was required.
Next, Mr Chong said that one of those fields was not readily available, namely the sender's identification number.
Given that that was a number to be allocated to Monster, as sender, by APRA and AMCOS, his professed concern was transparently illusory (T 134.3-.14).
41 After being taken through the draft document in cross-examination, which he had read at the time he received it, he agreed that it was relatively straightforward for Monster to provide information in that format, after making obvious assumptions (T136.18-.22).
He had made no investigation of the cost of attempting to comply with the draft format, despite what he had put in his affidavit to suggest this was a concern of his (T 136.39-.47).
42 Mr Chong is a very intelligent person.
The draft EDI format was not difficult to understand and, when he was taken through it, it was obvious that he was readily able to understand it.
I do not accept his evidence that the reason he did not implement the draft, notwithstanding the email of 4 March 2005, was because of any concerns or difficulties he had with the document.
43 Mr Chong also asserted that Schedule 2 of the licences required Monster to provide information about which works were APRA or AMCOS works, the unique identifying number of those works and the identifying telephone number of the IVR service.
He listed the problems he had with complying with the quarterly requirements in Schedule 2 is each licence as being that he had no way of knowing whether or not any particular ringtone was an APRA or AMCOS work or had an APRA or AMCOS identifying number or was sold through a particular one or more of Monster's thirty or so IVR service lines.
But Mr Mallett had told him on 20 January 2005 that the second and third items of this list were not required.
I am not satisfied that Mr Chong had any difficulty concerning the identifying numbers or IVR phone lines.
44 It was Monster's obligation under the AMCOS IVR and SMS licences to provide a list to APRA and AMCOS of the musical works it wished to reproduce in the form of ringtones under the agreement within 14 days of the date of each licence agreement (cl 5.2).
Whether the relevant works were those of APRA or AMCOS was for Monster to ascertain.
I am not satisfied Mr Chong was concerned about this at all.
Monster did not provide a list under cl 5 of the AMCOS licences.
Other examples were put to Mr Chong in cross-examination of instances when he, or companies he controlled, including Monster, used works for which they had made no arrangements with the owner of copyright, but only ceased the user when the owner complained.
By 31 March 2005 no royalties had been paid by Monster under the IVR licences, which were expressed to have commenced on 1 July 2003, some 21 months before and none had been paid under the SMS licences which had been expressed to commence on 1 October 2004.
45 I find that Monster and Mr Chong deliberately refrained from providing to APRA and AMCOS the information to the effect of that sought in the draft EDI specification as qualified by Mr Mallett so as to avoid paying for as long as possible what was due to the collecting societies.
Mr Chong gave no explanation as to Monster's or his failure to communicate with APRA or AMCOS about any difficulties or concerns after the 4 March 2005 email.
This deliberate default continued throughout 2005.
The email of 4 March 2005 was the last relevant communication on the question of what APRA and AMCOS required to be provided.
There was no basis on which Monster was entitled to ignore the requirements in the email to use the template provided and to return the information as soon as possible.
Mr Mallett's earlier conversation had identified the Telstra revenue returns as being sufficient to comply with the telecommunications service provider information specified in Schedule 2.
46 I am satisfied that Monster was aware that APRA and AMCOS had specified to it the form in which the information required was to be provided for the purposes of each licence.
I do not believe Mr Chong's evidence that he had any concerns or difficulties about the provision of that material in the form of the draft specification.
THE IVR LICENCES DISPUTE 
 
47 On 24 March 2005 Mr Mallett wrote to Mr Chong noting that Monster had still not provided relevant Telstra revenue statements or any further information beyond what was in Monster's letter of 11 February 2005.
Mr Mallett noted that that position was untenable.
He said there had been a failure to provide APRA and AMCOS with the information required to calculate the licence fees.
Acting on cl 8 of the agreements with APRA and cl 9 of the agreements with AMCOS, he informed Monster that on or after 25 April 2005 they would conduct an audit of the books of account and other records of Monster in order to obtain that information.
48 On 14 April 2005 Mr Mallett notified Mr Chong that the audit would commence on 27 April 2005 and that APRA and AMCOS had appointed Deloitte as auditors.
Among other things Mr Mallett noted that Monster should have available to the auditor statements provided by Telstra in relation to all IVR lines operated by Monster for the purposes of supplying ringtones, computer records detailing the mix of ringtone and non-ringtone material ordered by calls using those IVR lines and all other relevant records including computer records and associated metadata detailing the ringtones ordered from the commencement of the service to 31 March 2005.
49 In late May 2005 Deloitte reported to APRA and AMCOS.
The key findings in its audit report included the following:
 
 
 (a) Monster's revenues excluding GST from downloads for all content types totalled about $7.23 million for the period 1 July 2003 to 31 March 2005 based on Monster's financial records.
This was consistent both with revenues disclosed in monthly revenue statements provided by Telstra and Monster's quarterly business activity statements.
(b) Monster's financial records did not contain a breakdown of revenues per content type so as to enable identification of whether they were earned for the supply of ringtones, games, colour pictures or other categories of services which Monster offered.
(c) There was no record of payment or of provision for licence fees due to APRA or AMCOS in Monster's financial records.
(d) Revenue from ringtone and polyphonic downloads could not be conclusively calculated with the data provided by Monster.
(e) Historical log files for the IVR server and database backup types were not provided or available in the information Monster provided to Deloitte.
(f) While Deloitte had sighted the log file for the IVR server on 29 April 2005, it was missing from the system when analysed again on 3 May 2005 and Monster provided no explanation for the anomaly.
(g) It was not possible to validate independently database records based on the information provided by Monster to Deloitte.
This was said to be due to a number of factors including the masking of mobile numbers which purchased relevant services, the absence of or failure to provide log files and the absence of or failure to provide historical system backups.
