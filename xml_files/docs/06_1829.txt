 HIS HONOUR: 
 
1 This is an unfortunate case.
2 The applicant who appeals on questions of law from the decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal ('the Tribunal') is a Commonwealth public servant who has worked for the Commonwealth since 1994, apparently in a clerical capacity.
He was first employed in what was the Commonwealth Employment Service and then subsequently with its successor known as Centrelink from 1998.
At some point in 2001, said by the Tribunal to have been January 2001, he first experienced pain in his right arm, which he associated with his keyboard duties at work.
On 5 June 2001 he lodged a claim with the respondent under the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988 (Cth) ('the Act'), for compensation in respect of his right arm condition, which he described as: 'overuse injury affecting the right arm'.
3 Comcare accepted liability for particular named conditions of the right upper arm, shoulder, elbow and forearm, as well as of the neck.
However Comcare decided that as of 19 February 2003 the applicant no longer suffered from compensable affects of his accepted injury.
4 The applicant was diagnosed in mid-2003 as having right carpal tunnel syndrome.
The medical reports contain varying histories of when he first had pain in the region of his right wrist and hand.
