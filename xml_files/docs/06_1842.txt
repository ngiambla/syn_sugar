 
1 In this matter, I have read the submissions of the applicants.
I note that there has been repeated default by both respondents.
I have also had regard to the correspondence and emails in the history of the proceeding and, having considered the affidavits that are before me, I consider it appropriate to make orders in terms of the short minutes of order.
2 So far as the question of additional damages is concerned, there has been no opportunity to ventilate this and, in the circumstances, I am prepared to award half the amount of the compensatory damages.
In reaching this conclusion, I have taken into account the fact that substantial costs have been incurred and will be the liability of the respondents under the orders.
3 Accordingly, I make orders in accordance with the short minutes, except that in relation to the issue of additional damages, I award half of the compensatory damages sought which equates to an amount of $15, 047.50.

 
 I certify that the preceding three (3) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Tamberlin.
