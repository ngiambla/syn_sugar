 
1 The appellant, who is an Indonesian citizen of Chinese ethnicity and of Catholic religion, sought a protection visa on the basis that she had a well-founded fear of persecution on grounds of her race and religion.
The appellant also raised the claim of persecution by reason of her being a member of a minority social group of middle-aged female Christian Chinese persons in Indonesia who face persecution by native Indonesians.
She claimed to have experienced persecution as a student due to race and religion and that her parents were also persecuted due to race and religion.
2 The appellant left Indonesia in 1982 and has resided in Australia since that time.
She lodged an application for a protection visa on 13 February 2001, which was rejected by a delegate of the first respondent ('the delegate's decision').
That rejection was affirmed by the second respondent ('the Tribunal').
An appeal from that decision was dismissed by the Federal Magistrate; SZDTM v Minister for Immigration  Indigenous  Multicultural Affairs [2005] FMCA 728.
3 The issues that fall for consideration in this appeal are:
 
(a) Did the Tribunal demonstrate apprehended bias?

 (b) Did the Tribunal err in concluding that persecution because of a characteristic of a racial group (economic wealth or the perception thereof with respect to ethnic Chinese in Indonesia) does not attract the protection of the Convention?
(c) Did the Tribunal consider each of the appellant's claims?


4 There were a number of other matters raised by counsel for the appellant.
For the reasons given below, they do not fall for determination.
The allegation of a breach of s 425 of the Act, which was made before the Federal Magistrate, is not pressed in this appeal.
Did the Tribunal demonstrate apprehended bias?

 
5 The appellant seeks to establish that there was an appearance of bias.
Mr Karp, who appears for the appellant, submits that this should be inferred from the brevity of the hearing and from the following questions at the Tribunal hearing:
 
 
 'Q26.
...I think I have enough information from what you've told me to be able to make a decision on your application but before we conclude the hearing is there anything else that you'd like to tell me that you haven't already relating to your claims?

 
 
 
 
 
 A.
Yes.
I'm sorry, I have to tell you my story rather than answering your question.
Is it okay with you, sir?

 
 
 
 
 
 Q27.
No.
The purpose of the hearing today is not for you to tell me again what you have already told the department and the Tribunal.
The purpose of the hearing --- because I've read the documents very carefully.
The purpose of the hearing is for you to answer my questions... 
 
 
 
 A.
I am sorry sir.

 
 
 
 Q27 ---about the concerns that I have, so what I'm suggesting is that in addition to the points that you've already covered, is there anything else that you'd like to tell me that you haven't with respect to your claims?

 
 
 
 
 
 A.
No sir.
' 
 
 
 

To this I would add:
 
 
 'Q28.
Thank you.
Mr Mitchell, do you have any submission to make or, sorry, Ms Rider?

 The presence of the advisers 
 
6 The appellant was represented at the Tribunal hearing by advisers familiar with her case two migration agents from the consultancy Hitchcock  Associates ('the advisers') and credibility was not in issue.
The appellant was proficient in English and did not require an interpreter.
7 Ms Rider and Mr Mitchell were the advisers.
Ms Rider responded to Q28.
That response went to the substance of the case being presented and nothing was said about the procedure before the Tribunal or bias.
The Federal Magistrate at [16]---[17] described the relationship between the advisers and the appellant and the knowledge that they had of the appellant's case.
He concluded that the advisers would have been aware of the importance of putting to the Tribunal further information to support the appellant's case.
As his Honour noted, they neither interrupted the Tribunal member nor conveyed in any way a need to advance additional information to the Tribunal.
They were invited to make additional comments and the response was to raise the issue of the influence of newspaper articles on the appellant's apprehension of fear.
No action was taken after the hearing and prior to the handing down of the Tribunal decision.
8 Mr Karp claims that the Federal Magistrate held that the fact that the appellant was legally represented at the hearing itself precluded a finding that bias on the part of the Tribunal could have been reasonably apprehended.
The Federal Magistrate did point to the presence of the advisers, although not to legal representation.
His Honour's observations were in the context of an allegation before him of overbearing behaviour on the part of the Tribunal.
That is not the way the case is presented now.
9 It was not improper that the Federal Magistrate took into account the fact that the appellant was represented by the advisers who were totally conversant with her case or the fact that neither of those persons interrupted the Tribunal member or expressed any concern at the manner in which the hearing was conducted.
The context of the Tribunal hearing 
 
10 The hearing before the Tribunal should be viewed in context.
Taking the questioning by the Tribunal as a whole, in the context of the inquisitorial nature of the hearing, his Honour held that there had been no breach of the procedural fairness requirements of s 425 of the Act.
After a combined consideration of procedural fairness and apprehended bias, his Honour did not find that there had been apprehended bias on the part of the Tribunal.
