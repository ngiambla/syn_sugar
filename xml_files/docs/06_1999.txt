 INTRODUCTION Iraq has been a major export market for Australian wheat for many years.
Prior to 1999, the overseas marketing and export of wheat from Australia was controlled by the Australian Wheat Board ('Board'), which was a Commonwealth statutory authority.
The Board was first established during the second world war under the Wheat Acquisition Regulations 1939 (Cth).
After the war, the Board was established by the Wheat Industry Stabilization Act 1948 (Cth) and it has continued in existence under later Commonwealth legislation including, most recently, the Wheat Marketing Act 1989 (Cth) ('WMA').
As a result of amendments made to the WMA by the Wheat Marketing Amendment Act 1997 (Cth) and the Wheat Marketing Legislation Amendment Act 1998 (Cth), the control of wheat exports from Australia was transferred to AWB Limited ('AWB').
Since 1 July 1999, AWB has carried on business as the exclusive manager and marketer of bulk wheat exports from Australia.
It is required to purchase all wheat that is offered to it by Australian growers for inclusion in a pool operated by AWB, provided that the wheat meets standards set by AWB.
Growers are paid a purchase price that must be calculated by reference to the net return for the pool in which the wheat is included: s 84 of the WMA.
AWB carries out these functions under the general supervision of the Wheat Export Authority which is the successor to the Board: see ss 5 , 5D, 57 and 84 of the WMA.
By Letters Patent dated 10 November 2005, the Governor-General appointed the Honourable Terence Rhoderic Hudson Cole AO RFD QC ('the Commissioner') to inquire into, and report on, inter alia: (a) whether any decision, action, conduct, payment or writing of AWB, or any person associated with it, might have constituted a breach of any law of the Commonwealth, a State or Territory; (b) whether any decision, action, conduct, payment or writing of BHP Limited (now BHP Billiton Limited), BHP Billiton Petroleum Pty Limited, BHP Petroleum Limited, The Tigris Petroleum Corporation Pty Limited or The Tigris Petroleum Corporation Limited, or any person associated with one of those companies, in relation to specified shipments of Australian wheat to the Grain Board of Iraq, might have constituted a breach of any law of the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory; and (c) if the answer to either paragraph (a) or (b) above is in the affirmative --- whether the question of criminal or other legal proceedings should be referred to the relevant Commonwealth, State or Territory agency.
Between 23 November 2005 and 20 March 2006, the Commissioner issued twelve notices to produce documents to AWB pursuant to s 2(3A) of the Royal Commissions Act 1902 (Cth) ('RCA').
In addition, various notices to produce documents were directed by the Commissioner to employees of AWB.
From early 2006, AWB has maintained that a large number of documents falling within the scope of these notices are the subject of legal professional privilege.
These proceedings were instituted on 30 May 2006, shortly before the Royal Commissions Amendment Act 2006 (Cth) ('the Amending Act') came into force on 15 June 2006.
It is common ground that nothing in the RCA, as amended by the Amending Act, abrogates AWB's right to withhold documents caught by the notices to produce if they are properly the subject of legal professional privilege.
The Commissioner is named as the first respondent.
He has advised the Court that he intends to take no part in the proceedings and will abide any order made by the Court.
The second respondent, the Commonwealth of Australia, has acted as AWB's contradictor.
The principal relief sought by AWB in this proceeding is a declaration that the documents specified in revised lists of documents that have been filed with the Court are, or record, confidential communications that are protected from production to the Commissioner by legal professional privilege.
This claim falls squarely within the Court's jurisdiction under s 39B(1) and (1A)(c) of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth).
The Commonwealth does not suggest that the Amending Act deprives this Court of its jurisdiction to hear and determine AWB's claims for relief; on the contrary, it accepts that the Court has jurisdiction to determine whether the documents attract legal professional privilege.
At the commencement of the hearing, some 1,450 original documents were in issue.
During the course of the hearing, AWB withdrew its claim for a declaration that various documents were privileged and the Commonwealth accepted that other documents were the subject of legal professional privilege.
As a result, the number of contested original documents was reduced by some 550 to approximately 900 documents occupying 28 lever arch folders.
The trial of this proceeding was conducted on affidavit.
In support of its privilege claims, AWB relied upon thirty-two affidavits.
In addition, AWB relied upon specified exhibits to two affidavits sworn by Leonie Thompson of Arnold Bloch Leibler ('ABL') on 30 May 2006 and 19 June 2006 and certain background documents contained in Exhibit SMXD17 to the affidavit of Simon Daley, a solicitor acting for the Commonwealth, sworn 3 July 2006.
The deponents included AWB executives and employees, AWB's in-house lawyers, and lawyers from three Melbourne law firms, Blake Dawson Waldron ('Blakes'), Minter Ellison ('Minters') and ABL, that were retained to advise AWB in connection with issues arising from AWB's supply of wheat to Iraq.
None of the deponents were cross-examined.
The Commonwealth did not rely upon any affidavit evidence.
However, it tendered a substantial volume of documents and passages from the transcript of evidence given to the Commission.
The documents at issue in this proceeding span a period of years from about 2002 to 2006.
Over that period, AWB was involved in a number of investigations concerning its sale of wheat to Iraq under the United Nations' Oil-For-Food Programme ('OFF Programme').
AWB conducted two internal investigations, known as Project Rose and Project Water.
In addition, AWB was exposed to investigations by the United States Senate, the Independent Inquiry Committee of the United Nations and ultimately the Commission.
As many of the documents arise out of these investigations, it is necessary to describe their nature and scope in general terms.
THE OIL-FOR-FOOD PROGRAMME Following the invasion of Kuwait by Iraq, the United Nations Security Council determined on 2 August 1990 that trade sanctions should be imposed on Iraq.
In particular, the Security Council adopted Resolution 661 of 6 August 1990 ('Resolution 661') which provided, inter alia, that all States: (a) shall prevent the sale or supply by their nationals of any commodities or products to any person or body in Iraq or for the purposes of any business carried on in or operated from Iraq, 'but not including supplies intended strictly for medical purposes, and, in humanitarian circumstances, foodstuffs' ; and (b) shall prevent their nationals and any persons within their territory from removing or otherwise making available any funds or other financial or economic resources to the Government of Iraq or to persons or bodies within Iraq, 'except payments exclusively for strictly medical or humanitarian purposes and, in humanitarian circumstances, foodstuffs' .
In April 1991, the Security Council passed Resolution 687 which provided that the prohibition against the sale or supply to Iraq of commodities or products other than medicine and health supplies would not apply to foodstuffs notified to the Committee established by Resolution 661.
On 14 April 1995, the Security Council adopted Resolution 986 which established the OFF Programme.
Specifically, by that resolution: (a) the Security Council authorised States to purchase petroleum and petroleum products originating in Iraq; (b) provided that full payment for each purchase was to be made directly into the escrow account to be established in accordance with the Resolution; and (c) decided that funds in the escrow account: 
 
 shall be used to meet the humanitarian needs of the Iraqi population and for the following other purposes, and requests the Secretary-General to use the funds deposited in the escrow account: 
 
 To finance the export to Iraq, in accordance with the procedures of the Committee established by resolution 661 (1990), of medicine, health supplies, foodstuffs, and materials and supplies for essential civilian needs, ... provided that: 
 
 Each export of goods is at the request of the Government of Iraq; 
 
 Iraq effectively guarantees their equitable distribution, on the basis of a plan submitted to and approved by the Secretary-General, including a description of the goods to be purchased; 
 
 (iii) The Secretary-General receives authenticated confirmation that the exported goods concerned have arrived in Iraq'.

 
 
 
 The escrow account was under the control of the United Nations in New York.
Funds standing to the credit of the escrow account were available to be used by Iraq for the purchase of humanitarian goods and services, including the purchase of food, in accordance with the conditions and procedures laid down by the United Nations.
On 20 May 1996, the United Nations and the Government of Iraq entered into a Memorandum of Understanding in relation to the implementation of Resolution 986.
Section II of that Memorandum provided for the Government of Iraq to adopt a distribution plan that was designed to achieve an equitable distribution of medicine, health supplies, foodstuffs and other materials to the Iraqi population throughout the various Governates of Iraq.
THE INDEPENDENT INQUIRY COMMITTEE On 21 April 2004, following allegations of fraud and corruption in relation to the administration of the OFF Programme, the Secretary-General of the United Nations appointed an Independent Inquiry Committee ('the IIC') to investigate the administration of the OFF Programme.
The chairman of the IIC was Paul Volcker, a former chairman of the United States Federal Reserve.
The other members of the IIC were Mark Pieth of Switzerland, an expert on money laundering in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, and Justice Richard Goldstone of South Africa, a former chief prosecutor of the United Nations International Criminal Tribunals for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda.
The IIC's terms of reference were as follows: 
 
 independent inquiry shall collect and examine information relating to the administration and management of the Oil-for-Food Programme, including allegations of fraud and corruption on the part of United Nations officials, personnel and agents, as well as contractors, including entities that have entered into contracts with the United Nations or with Iraq under the Programme: 
 
 (a) to determine whether the procedures established by the Organization, including the Security Council and the Security Council Committee Established by Resolution 661 (1990) Concerning the Situation between Iraq and Kuwait (hereinafter referred to as the "661 Committee") for the processing and approval of contracts under the Programme, and the monitoring of the sale and delivery of petroleum and petroleum products and the purchase and delivery of humanitarian goods, were violated, bearing in mind the respective roles of United Nations officials, personnel and agents, as well as entities that have entered into contracts with the United Nations or with Iraq under the Programme; 
 
 
 
 (b) to determine whether any United Nations officials, personnel, agents or contractors engaged in any illicit or corrupt activities in the carrying out of their respective roles in relation to the Programme, including, for example, bribery in relation to oil sales, abuses in regard to surcharges on oil sales and illicit payments in regard to purchases of humanitarian goods; 
 
 
 
 (c) to determine whether the accounts of the Programme were in order and were maintained in accordance with the relevant Financial Regulations and Rules of the United Nations.
' 
 
 
 
 By Security Council Resolution 1538, the Security Council called upon the Coalition Provisional Authority, Iraq, and all Member States of the United Nations, including their national regulatory authorities, to cooperate fully by all appropriate means with the IIC.
The IIC issued its final report, entitled 'Manipulation of the Oil-for-Food Programme by the Iraqi Regime', on 27 October 2005 ('the Final Report').
The IIC found that Iraq had received illicit income totalling about US$1.8 billion from companies that obtained oil and humanitarian goods contracts.
It also found that the largest source of illicit income for the Iraqi regime came from payments made by companies that Iraq selected to receive contracts for humanitarian goods under the OFF Programme.
These payments were disguised by various subterfuges and were not reported to the United Nations by Iraq or by the participating contractors.
In its Final Report, the IIC said that the illicit payments developed in mid-1999 from Iraq's effort to recoup the costs it incurred to transport goods to inland destinations after their arrival by sea at the Persian Gulf port of Umm Qasr.
The IIC said that, rather than seeking approval from the United Nations for compensation for such costs from the OFF Programme's escrow account, Iraq required humanitarian contractors to make such payments directly to Iraqi-controlled bank accounts or to front companies outside Iraq that in turn forwarded the payments to the Government of Iraq.
The IIC observed that, not only were these side payments unauthorised, it was also an easy matter for Iraq to impose 'inland transportation' fees that far exceeded the actual transportation costs.
The IIC also stated that, by mid 2000, Iraq instituted a broader policy that applied a 10 per cent surcharge on all humanitarian contracts, in addition to any requirement that contractors pay inland transportation fees.
The surcharge was described in most cases as an 'after sales service fee'.
The IIC said that one conduit for the payment of inland transportation fees to the Iraqi regime was a Jordanian company called Alia for Transportation and General Trade Co ('Alia').
The IIC stated that Alia was owned partly by Iraq's Ministry of Transportation and acted as a collection agent for the Government of Iraq to receive inland transportation payments from certain humanitarian goods suppliers.
The IIC found that the actual transportation of goods from the port of Umm Qasr to inland destinations in Iraq was in fact provided by Iraqi Government employees, and not by Alia.
In its Final Report, the IIC made a number of specific findings in relation to AWB.
It found that AWB paid transportation fees to Alia from December 1999 through until about May 2003 when the OFF Programme came to an end as a result of the invasion of Iraq by US and coalition forces.
In connection with AWB's first three contracts from late 1999 to mid 2000, inland transport fees ranged between $10.80 and $12.00 per metric tonne ('pmt').
The rates rose to between $14.00 and $15.00 pmt in 2000 and then sharply increased in contracts from 2001 to 2003 to between $45.00 and $56.00 pmt.
The IIC also found that AWB did not advise the United Nations that it was making payments to Alia for inland transportation costs.
The IIC summed up its conclusions in relation to AWB in the following passage of its Final Report: 
 
 summary, based on the available evidence, AWB paid to Alia over $221.7 million for what it termed inland transport or trucking fees.
These payments were channeled to the Government of Iraq by Alia.
Both AWB and Alia deny that AWB knew of Iraq's partial ownership of Alia, and there is no evidence to contradict these denials.
AWB also denies knowing that Alia did not actually transport its wheat from Umm Qasr and that Alia remitted the money paid by AWB to the Government of Iraq.
On the one hand, there is no evidence that Alia told AWB that it was not performing transport services for AWB's wheat or that it was channeling AWB's payments to the Government of Iraq.
On the other hand, numerous aspects of the AWB-Alia relationship, as well as the nature of many of the documents received by AWB and discussed above, suggest that some employees of AWB were placed on notice of facts strongly suggesting that AWB's payments were in whole or in part for the benefit of the Government of Iraq.
Of particular significance is the degree to which Alia's trucking prices rose sharply beyond what would apparently be a reasonable transportation fee and without other apparent justification.
Such increases, in conjunction with AWB's knowledge that Alia had been nominated in the first place by the Government of Iraq, should have signaled AWB officials to the probability that the Government of Iraq stood to illicitly benefit financially from AWB's payments to Alia.
In addition, IGB [the Iraqi Grain Board] and ISCWT [the Iraqi State Company for Water Transport --- ie the port authority] initiated or were party to communications concerning AWB's payment of Alias fees, and AWB was warned that the Government of Iraq would not allow its ships to unload until Alia was paid.
' 
 
 It is relevant to note that, in February 2005, investigators from the IIC travelled to Australia and interviewed a number of senior officers of AWB.
In addition, AWB made a large number of documents available to the IIC investigators.
Certain disclosures by AWB to the IIC represent one ground upon which the Commonwealth contends that there has been a waiver of legal professional privilege by AWB over some of the documents at issue in these proceedings.
PROJECT ROSE Project Rose commenced in about June 2003 when James Cooper ('Cooper'), the then general counsel of AWB, was asked to initiate an internal investigation of AWB's trading activities in Iraq.
The internal investigation began following the publication of a letter dated 3 June 2003 from Alan Tracey ('Tracey'), president of a lobby group known as US Wheat Associates, to Colin Powell, then the US Secretary of State, in which Tracey alleged that prices in contracts for the sale of wheat under the OFF Programme had been inflated and that some of the sale proceeds might have gone into the accounts of Saddam Hussein's family.
Cooper engaged Christopher Quennell ('Quennell'), a consultant employed by Blakes in its Melbourne office, to advise in relation to AWB's internal investigations.
In evidence before the Commission, Cooper described the scope of Project Rose in these terms: 
 
 subject matter was all of ...
AWB's dealings with Iraq during the operation of the Oil-for-Food Program.
... 
 
 The issues that were raised were the underlying collection of information to understand the company's position and, secondly, the understanding of the requirement for AWB to be involved in an inquiry in the United States, which involved many, ... fairly complex legal issues, particularly over jurisdiction.
' 
 
 Later in his evidence to the Commission, Cooper described his retainer of Quennell and Blakes in these terms: 
 
 initially happened in June 2003 was that Chris Quennell came in and took instructions and was told to undertake a review of all of the facts and his assessment of the allegations made by the US Wheat Associates, and he did that by obtaining email records, ... he got paper files, he interviewed staff members and conducted quite a large review.

 
 it was an open-ended instruction to him to come into the company and undertake this review and report back on his findings from time to time.
' 
 


On this evidence, Cooper plainly contemplated that Quennell would assess the evidence and the allegations and report back his findings.
In this proceeding, Quennell gave evidence on affidavit that his understanding of his instructions was to review available evidence and interview potential witnesses for the purpose of advising AWB as to its legal position in respect of its sale of wheat to the Grain Board of Iraq ('GBI') under the OFF Programme.
He added that the scope of his task and instructions evolved as the matter progressed, particularly following the announcement by the Permanent Investigations Committee of the United States Senate ('PSI') of its intention to conduct an investigation and then the appointment of the IIC by the United Nations to conduct an independent inquiry into the OFF Programme.
In due course, the board of AWB received a briefing on Project Rose on 25 May 2004.
The board minutes record the following: 
 
 Rose 
 
 Board noted it had received a briefing on Project Rose (attended also by directors of AWB (International) Limited) on Tuesday 25 May 2004 and had also received a memorandum on this matter from the Managing Director on 6 May 2004.
Project Rose is the code-name for the AWB Group's internal investigation of AWB's wheat exports to Iraq and AWB's involvement in the United Nations Oil for Food Program (OFF) in regard to which allegations of impropriety had been made in the public arena.

 
 briefing session was addressed by Mr Jim Cooper, General Counsel, and Mr Chris Quennell, trade and transport lawyer of Blake Dawson Waldron.
(The Board noted that a copy of the briefing presentation would be filed with the Board papers).

 
 Board noted the following with regard to the Project Rose briefing: 
 
 The allegations of impropriety had commenced with correspondence from the US Wheat Associates to the US Secretary of State, Mr Colin Powell, on 3 June 2003.
There had been sporadic media commentary since that time, and a number of inquiries (all of which remain unconfirmed) had been reported as follows: UN independent inquiry into the OFF program; Interim Iraqi Governing Council Investigation (reportedly to be conducted by KPMG); US House of Representatives Investigation; and a US Senate Committee on Foreign Relations Investigation.

 
 The Project Rose investigation commenced in June 2003 and has involved a comprehensive review of all contract arrangements for the export of wheat by AWB to Iraq from mid 1999 to 2002, including the inland freight arrangements within Iraq.

 
 The findings to date of the Project Rose Investigation are as follows: 
 
 all AWB contracts were approved by the Office of the Iraq Program at the United Nations; no evidence has been identified of any AWB knowledge that money paid to the Jordanian transport firm, Alia, was onpaid to the Iraq regime; no evidence has been identified of payment of funds by AWB to any other person in relation to the OFF shipments; and no evidence has been identified of payment of funds to any AWB employee or any other person in relation to OFF shipments.
' 
 
 
 
 Blakes made a power point presentation to the board concerning the outcome of its investigations.
The presentation said that Blakes had taken a 'factual snapshot' by reviewing 14 international sales and marketing ring binders, 100 chartering files and more than 30,000 AWB emails for 1999 and 2000, interviewing AWB personnel and conducting an audit of documents held by AWB (USA).
It set out Blakes' findings in terms similar to those recorded in the board minutes.
In addition, it referred to findings that wheat contracts from July 1999 to December 2002 included a trucking fee payable to Alia that had been nominated by GBI; that the same trucking fee was payable under each contract regardless of the destination of the cargo or the distance transported; and that the trucking fee increased from time to time for no apparent reason.
The presentation also stated that Richard Tracey QC (as his Honour then was) had given legal advice in conference on 25 May 2004 that there was no evidence of breach of the relevant United Nations resolution on sanctions and no evidence of breach of Australian domestic law.
The evidence before this Court makes it clear that Project Rose was a continuing process of review and reporting that extended beyond the board meeting of 25 May 2004 and throughout 2004 and 2005.
For instance, Mr Tracey QC provided memoranda of advice on 31 March 2005 and 12 August 2005 in relation to Project Rose and the question whether AWB had paid inflated prices for transport or port charges in breach of the United Nations' sanctions or Australian domestic law.
Its scope also broadened to include the provision of legal advice and assistance in connection with the PSI investigation, the inquiry undertaken by the IIC and, lastly, the inquiry that is being undertaken by the Commission.
As time passed, Blakes, Minters and ABL each provided advice and assistance to AWB under the umbrella of Project Rose.
Although the immediate focus of Project Rose shifted from time to time between allegations that were publicly made against AWB, the PSI investigation, the IIC investigation, and the Commission, it always involved an ongoing review and investigation of documents and other evidence to determine whether AWB, or any of its employees, had made payments to the Iraqi regime in breach of the United Nations' sanctions or engaged in any other wrongdoing in connection with the sale of wheat to Iraq under the OFF Programme.
PROJECT WATER Cooper instructed Quennell to commence the investigation known as Project Water on 12 August 2004.
It involved a review of all matters concerning The Tigris Petroleum Corporation Limited ('Tigris').
The Commonwealth contends that AWB and Tigris entered into a transaction whereby AWB agreed to inflate the prices in two contracts (A1670 and A1680) for the supply of 1,000,000 mt of wheat to GBI, as a means of extracting funds from the United Nations' escrow account to repay a debt of approximately US$8 million which GBI owed to Tigris and to provide AWB with the funds required to make a rebate payment to GBI of approximately US$2 million ('the Tigris transaction').
Before the Commission, Cooper gave evidence that on or shortly before 12 August 2004 he was asked, either by Andrew Lindberg ('Lindberg') or Sarah Scales ('Scales'), to undertake a review of AWB's dealings with Tigris.
Lindberg was AWB's managing director, and Scales was the general manager of AWB (International) Limited ('AWBI').
AWBI is the subsidiary of AWB that is responsible for international wheat sales and marketing.
He said that Scales wanted the review undertaken because a sum of money of over US$8 million was being held in an account of AWBI, and she was not comfortable in approving the payment of that sum to Tigris without understanding all of the circumstances of its receipt by AWBI.
As a result, on 12 August 2004 Cooper and two members of his legal division, Rosemary Peavey ('Peavey') and Rosalyn Santen ('Santen'), initiated a telephone call to Quennell.
In the course of that telephone conversation, Cooper asked Quennell to commence a review of all dealings with Tigris, with particular focus on whether it was proper to make a payment to Tigris of the money held in AWBI's account.
Quennell's review took about three months.
Then in December 2004, AWB paid the sum of US$7,087,202.24 to Tigris and retained a fee of US$500,000.00 for assisting in the repayment of the debt.
Some evidence suggests that Project Water, as such, came to an end in December 2004, while other evidence suggests it was an ongoing investigation.
But, whether or not the description of Project Water strictly applied, AWB and its legal advisers continued to investigate and review the facts and circumstances of the Tigris transaction during 2005 in order to determine whether it involved any wrongdoing by AWB or any of its employees.
THE INQUIRY BY THE UNITED STATES SENATE PERMANENT SUB-COMMITTEE ON INVESTIGATIONS In mid 2004, the PSI announced that it proposed to conduct an investigation into the OFF Programme.
AWB retained Minters and several US law firms to advise it in relation to the PSI investigation.
The evidence indicates that Blakes also provided some advice to AWB in connection with this investigation.
THE MAIN ISSUES As argued before me, the case focused on three issues.
The first issue is whether AWB has established its claim that legal professional privilege attaches to each of the documents that remain in contest.
The only head of privilege that AWB relies on is the privilege that attaches to documents brought into existence for the dominant purpose of obtaining or giving legal advice.
In AWB Limited v Honourable Terence Rhoderic Hudson Cole [2006] FCA 571 ( 'AWB v Cole' ), I held that litigation privilege was not available to protect documents brought into existence in contemplation of the Commission and none of the parties has disputed that decision.
AWB has not contended that legal professional privilege is available solely because documents were brought into existence in contemplation of inquiries being undertaken by the PSI or by the IIC.
The second issue is whether, assuming privilege attaches, that privilege has been waived by virtue of AWB's disclosure of the gist or substance of certain legal advices which it obtained.
I will have to determine whether waiver should be imputed to AWB as a matter of law and, if so, what is the extent of that waiver.
The Commonwealth contends that the waiver extends to all documents that relate to Project Rose and Project Water.
The third issue is whether legal professional privilege attaches to documents that came into existence in connection with AWB's settlement of a claim by GBI for a rebate of approximately US$2 million on account of the fact that earlier shipments of wheat by AWB had been contaminated by iron filings ('the iron filings claim').
The Commonwealth contends that the iron filings claim is inextricably linked with the Tigris transaction, in that the prices for wheat contracts A1670 and A1680 were inflated to cover both the amount of the iron filings claim and the repayment by GBI of the debt which it owed to Tigris.
It said that AWB proposed to pay the iron filings claim directly to Alia as an addition to inland transport fees, but spread over several contracts.
The Commonwealth argued that the inflation of the contract prices to cover the iron filings claim was concealed from the United Nations and that it involved a contravention of the United Nations' sanctions.
In these circumstances, the Commonwealth contends that AWB cannot maintain its claim to privilege over the legal advice it obtained in relation to the iron filings claim as that advice was obtained in furtherance of a fraud, wrongful conduct or sham transaction.
AWB contends that there is no evidence which would permit this Court to conclude that the arrangements for payment of the iron filings claim involved a breach of the United Nations' sanctions or any breach of Australian law, or that the relevant advice was given in furtherance of any improper conduct.
It submitted that the documents relating to the iron filings claim over which privilege is claimed go to the issue of the legality of the payment and were not created in furtherance of any sham or fraud.
LEGAL ADVICE PRIVILEGE --- GENERAL PRINCIPLES Under the legal advice limb of legal professional privilege, a document will attract privilege if it was brought into existence for the dominant purpose of giving or obtaining legal advice: Esso Australia Resources Limited v Commissioner of Taxation [1999] HCA 67 ; (1999) 201 CLR 49 ( 'Esso' ) at 64-65 [35]; Daniels Corporations International Pty Ltd v Australian Competition  Consumer Commission [2002] HCA 49 ; (2002) 213 CLR 543 ( 'Daniels' ) at 552 [9].
AWB placed particular reliance on Dawson J's formulation of the scope of legal advice privilege in Waterford v Commonwealth [1987] HCA 25 ; (1987) 163 CLR 54 at 95: 
 
 legal professional privilege relied upon in this case is that which attaches to communications between a legal adviser and his client for the purpose of giving or receiving legal advice and to documents recording those communications or containing information for the purpose of enabling the advice to be given.
In order to attract that privilege, the communications must be confidential and the legal adviser must be acting in his professional capacity: see Minet v Morgan ; Wheeler v Le Marchant ; Smith v Daniell ; Bullivant v Attorney-General (Vict.
) ; Jones v Great Central Railway Co ; O'Rourke v Darbishire ' .

 

There is nothing controversial about this formulation of the principle.
I reviewed the relevant authorities and extracted the principles which govern legal advice privilege in my decision in AWB v Cole at [60]-[63] and [85]-[110].
I adhere to what I said in that case.
I do not propose to engage in a lengthy discussion of the authorities concerning legal advice privilege in these reasons for judgment, other than to the extent necessary to address the arguments advanced by the parties.
The general principles that I consider relevant to the disposition of this case can be summarised as follows: (1) The party claiming privilege carries the onus of proving that the communication was undertaken, or the document was brought into existence, for the dominant purpose of giving or obtaining legal advice.
The onus might be discharged by evidence as to the circumstances and context in which the communications occurred or the documents were brought into existence, or by evidence as to the purposes of the person who made the communication, or authored the document, or procured its creation.
It might also be discharged by reference to the nature of the documents, supported by argument or submissions: see Grant v Downs [1976] HCA 63 ; (1976) 135 CLR 674 ( 'Grant v Downs' ) at 689; Commissioner of Taxation v Pratt Holdings Pty Ltd (2005) 225 ALR 266 at 278 [30] ( 'FCT v Pratt Holdings' ); and AWB v Cole at [63].
(2) The purpose for which a document is brought into existence is a question of fact that must be determined objectively.
Evidence of the intention of the document's maker, or of the person who authorised or procured it, is not necessarily conclusive.
It may be necessary to examine the evidence concerning the purpose of other persons involved in the hierarchy of decision-making or consultation that led to the creation of the document and its subsequent communication: see AWB v Cole at [110].
(3) The existence of legal professional privilege is not established merely by the use of verbal formula: Grant v Downs at 689 per Stephen, Mason and Murphy JJ.
Nor is a claim of privilege established by mere assertion that privilege applies to particular communications or that communications are undertaken for the purpose of obtaining or giving 'legal advice': National Crime Authority v S (1991) 29 FCR 203 at 211---212 per Lockhart J; Candacal Pty Ltd v Industry Research  Development Board (2005) 223 ALR 284 (' Candacal' ) at 298 [70]; Seven Network Limited v News Limited [2005] FCA 142 at [6] ---[8].
If assertions of that kind are received in evidence in support of the privilege claim, their conclusionary nature can leave unclear what advice was really being sought.
There will be cases in which a claim of privilege will not be sustainable in the absence of evidence identifying the circumstances in which the relevant communication took place and the topics to which the instructions or advice were directed: Kennedy v Wallace [2004] FCAFC 337 ; (2004) 142 FCR 185 ( 'Kennedy v Wallace' ) at 189---190 [12]---[17] per Black CJ and Emmett J and at 211---212 [144]---[145] and at 215---216 [166]---[171] per Allsop J; see also Southern Equities Corporation Ltd (in liq) v Arthur Andersen  Co (No 6) [2001] SASC 398.
(4) Where communications take place between a client and his or her independent legal advisers, or between a client's in-house lawyers and those legal advisers, it may be appropriate to assume that legitimate legal advice was being sought, absent any contrary indications: Kennedy v Wallace (2004) 208 ALR 424 at 442 [65] per Gyles J; affirmed on appeal, Kennedy v Wallace at 191-192 [23]-[27] per Black CJ and Emmett J.
In Kennedy v Wallace , Black CJ and Emmett J inclined to the view that in the ordinary case of a client consulting a lawyer about a legal problem in uncontroversial circumstances, proof of those facts alone will provide a sufficient basis for a conclusion that legitimate legal advice is being sought or given.
(5) A 'dominant purpose' is one that predominates over other purposes; it is the prevailing or paramount purpose: AWB v Cole at [105]-[106]; FCT v Pratt Holdings at 279-280 [30] per Kenny J.
(6) An appropriate starting point when applying the dominant purpose test is to ask what was the intended use or uses of the document which accounted for it being brought into existence: Pratt Holdings Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2004] FCAFC 122 ; (2004) 136 FCR 357 at 366 [35] per Finn J.
(7) The concept of legal advice is fairly wide.
It extends to professional advice as to what a party should prudently or sensibly do in the relevant legal context; but it does not extend to advice that is purely commercial or of a public relations character: Balabel v Air India [1988] 1 Ch 317 ( 'Balabel' ) at 323 and 330; Nederlandse Reassurantie Groep Holding NV v Bacon and Woodrow [1995] 1 All ER 976 ( 'Nederlandse' ) at 983; Three Rivers District Council v Governor and Company of the Bank of England (No 6) [2004] UKHL 48 ; [2005] 1 AC 610 ( 'Three Rivers' ) at 652-653 [43]-[44], 657-658 [59]-[60], 681 [114] and 683 [120]; Dalleagles Pty Ltd v Australian Securities Commission (1991) 4 WAR 325 ( 'Dalleagles' ) at 332-333; DSE (Holdings) Pty Ltd v Intertan Inc [2003] FCA 1191 ; (2003) 135 FCR 151 ( 'DSE' ) at 161-173 [25]---[71]; and AWB v Cole at [100]-[101].
(8) Legal professional privilege protects the disclosure of documents that record legal work carried out by the lawyer for the benefit of the client, such as research memoranda, collations and summaries of documents, chronologies and the like, whether or not they are actually provided to the client: Daniels at 563 [44] per McHugh J; Commissioner of Australian Federal Police v Propend Finance Pty Ltd [1997] HCA 3 ; (1997) 188 CLR 501 ( 'Propend' ) at 550 per McHugh J; Dalleagles at 333---334 per Anderson J; Trade Practices Commission v Sterling (1979) 36 FLR 244 ( 'Stirling' ) at 245---246 per Lockhart J; and Kennedy v Lyell (1883) 23 Ch D 387 at 407; Lyell v Kennedy (1884) 27 Ch D 1 at 31 per Bowen LJ; Propend Finance Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Australian Federal Police (1995) 58 FCR 224 at 266 per Lindgren J.
(9) Subject to meeting the dominant purpose test, legal professional privilege extends to notes, memoranda or other documents made by officers or employees of the client that relate to information sought by the client's legal adviser to enable him or her to advise: Stirling at 246.
The privilege extends to drafts, notes and other material brought into existence by the client for the purpose of communication to the lawyer, whether or not they are themselves actually communicated to the lawyer: Saunders v Commissioner of Australian Federal Police (1998) 160 ALR 469 at 472.
(10) Legal professional privilege is capable of attaching to communications between a salaried legal adviser and his or her employer, provided that the legal adviser is consulted in a professional capacity in relation to a professional matter and the communications are made in confidence and arise from the relationship of lawyer and client: Waterford v Commonwealth [1987] HCA 25 ; (1987) 163 CLR 54 at 96 per Dawson J; see also Deane J at 79---82.
Some cases have added a requirement that the lawyer who provided the advice must be admitted to practice: see Dawson J in Waterford at 96; GSA Industries (Aust) Pty Ltd v Constable (2002) 2 Qd R 146 at 150; Glengallan Investments Pty Ltd v Arthur Andersen (2002) 1 Qd R 233 at 245.
However, in Commonwealth v Vance (2005) 158 ACTR 47, the Full Court (Gray, Connolly and Tamberlin JJ) did not regard the possession of a current practising certificate as an essential precondition to the availability of legal professional privilege: at [23]---[35].
The same view was taken by Lee J in Candacal at 303 [99], by Gillard J in Australian Hospital Care (Pindara) Pty Ltd v Duggan [1999] VSC 131 at [111] , and by Downes J in Re McKinnon and Secretary, Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade [2004] AATA 1365 ; (2004) 86 ALD 780 at 785 [51] .
(11) Legal professional privilege protects communications rather than documents, as the test for privilege is anchored to the purpose for which the document was brought into existence.
Consequently, legal professional privilege can attach to copies of non-privileged documents if the purpose of bringing the copy into existence satisfies the dominant purpose test: Propend at 507 per Brennan CJ, 544 per Gaudron J, 553-554 per McHugh J, 571-572 per Gummow J, and 587 per Kirby J.
In Propend at 512, Brennan CJ added a qualification to this principle: if an original unprivileged document is not in existence or its location is not disclosed or is not accessible to the persons seeking to execute the warrant, and if no unprivileged copy or other admissible evidence is made available to prove the contents of the original, the otherwise privileged copy loses its protection.
(12) The Court has power to examine documents over which legal professional privilege is claimed.
Where there is a disputed claim, the High Court has said that the court should not be hesitant to exercise such a power: Esso ; see also Grant v Downs at 689.
If the power is exercised, the court will need to recognise that it does not have the benefit of submissions or evidence that might place the document in its proper context.
The essential purpose of such an inspection is to determine whether, on its face, the nature and content of the document supports the claim for legal professional privilege.
AWB'S LAWYERS AND THEIR RETAINERS The Commonwealth contended that Project Rose and Project Water were purely factual investigations and therefore should not be regarded as attracting any legal professional privilege.
In advancing this contention, the Commonwealth tended to assume that factual investigations by lawyers, such as a review of documents and interviews of persons involved in the matter under investigation, can be separated from the ultimate legal advice given by the lawyers as a result of their factual investigation.
Leaving aside any question of waiver, this seems to be an unduly narrow approach to the scope of legal advice privilege.
In my view, it finds no support in the authorities.
In recognition of the fact that legal professional privilege is a fundamental common law right, the courts have eschewed an overly narrow or technical approach to the identification of communications or documents that fall within the scope of legal advice privilege.
As I said in AWB v Cole at [127]---[133], the legal advice limb of the privilege extends beyond material that is literally a communication, or a record of a communication, of legal advice or instructions.
In Propend at 569, Gummow J said that the privilege extends to any document prepared by a lawyer or client from which one might infer the nature of the advice sought or given.
The principle extends to internal documents or parts of documents of the client, or of the lawyer, reproducing or otherwise revealing communications which would be covered by privilege: Bank of Nova Scotia v Hellenic Mutual War Risks Association (Bermuda) Ltd [1992] 2 Lloyd's Rep 540 at 540 per Saville J.
Where a lawyer has been retained for the purposes of providing legal advice in relation to a particular transaction or series of transactions, communications between the lawyer and the client relating to that transaction will be privileged, notwithstanding that they do not contain advice on matters of law; it is enough that they are directly related to the performance by the lawyer of his or her professional duty as legal adviser to the client: Minter v Priest [1930] AC 558 at 581---586; Balabel at 330; Nederlandse at 983 and Dalleagles at 332---333.
In Dalleagles , Anderson J said at 332---333 that professional discourse in a professional capacity between a solicitor and his client with reference to the transactions covered by his instructions should be regarded as prima facie for the purpose of giving and receiving advice.
In his Honour's view, this would apply to any communication that is on its face a communication of a professional nature from the solicitor to the client or his agent touching the subject matter of the solicitor's engagement and any communication from the client to the solicitor in connection with that engagement.
These propositions were referred to, with approval, by Allsop J in DSE at [51]-[52] and by Branson J in Wenkart v Commissioner of Federal Police (unreported, Federal Court, Branson J, 11 November 1996).
In DSE , Allsop J said that there was no substantive difference between the views expressed in Balabel and Dalleagles : at [51], [52] and [71].
Allsop J also observed that what underlies the expression of opinion in those cases is the recognition that the obligation of the lawyer to advise, once retained, is pervasive.
In his Honour's view, it would be rare that one could, with any degree of confidence, say that a communication between client and lawyer, in the circumstances of a retainer requiring legal advice and the directing of the client by a legal adviser, was not connected with the provision or requesting of legal advice.
Indeed, too literal a requirement of identifying legal advice as express advice about the law would place undue emphasis on formalism and undermine the privilege.
Rix J (as his Lordship then was) expressed much the same view in Hellenic Mutual War Risks Associated (Bermuda) Ltd v Harrison [1997] 1 Lloyd's Rep 160 at 168.
In Three Rivers , the relevant legal context consisted of a commission of inquiry into the part played by the Bank of England in the collapse of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International SA.
The House of Lords upheld the Bank of England's claim that legal advice privilege attached to documents that had been generated for the purposes of providing information to the Bank's legal advisers to enable them to prepare submissions and evidence, and to advise on the nature, presentation, timing and content of the Bank's responses to the inquiry.
Relevant passages from the speeches in the House of Lords are extracted in my decision in AWB v Cole at [92]---[96].
In this case, the relevant legal context consisted, initially, of public allegations that AWB had acted in breach of United Nations' sanctions by making improper payments to the Iraqi regime.
Those public allegations were soon followed by a series of investigations by the IIC, the PSI and the Commission.
Blakes was retained for the purpose of advising whether, as a matter of law, there was any substance in the allegations of improper conduct by AWB.
As the various investigations were announced, Blakes' retainer was extended to the provision of advice in connection with them.
AWB specifically extended Blakes' retainer to include the provision of advice in relation to AWB's dealings with Tigris.
It is unclear whether Blakes provided any substantial advice to AWB in connection with the Commission.
The catalyst for AWB's engagement of Minters appears to have been the announcement of the PSI investigation.
From about 1 July 2004, Minters advised AWB in relation to the PSI investigation.
However, Minter's engagement extended more widely than the provision of advice concerning the actual conduct of the PSI investigation; it included a comprehensive review by Minters of all of the documents and other evidence surrounding AWB's sales of wheat to Iraq under the OFF Programme.
A key objective of this review was to determine whether there was any evidence that AWB or any of its employees had made payments to Iraq that contravened the United Nations' sanctions or engaged in any other wrongdoing in connection with the OFF Programme.
Minter's engagement was subsequently extended to the provision of advice and assistance to AWB in connection with the IIC investigation.
Minters' wider role in reviewing and analysing the available documents and evidence, which included interviewing employees or former employees, continued during the period of the IIC investigation.
Minters played a prominent role in liaising with the US law firms which AWB retained to act for it in connection with the PSI and IIC investigations.
Minters and Blakes acted in tandem in providing advice in connection with the PSI and IIC investigations and in their ongoing review and investigation of the facts and circumstances surrounding AWB's wheat exports to Iraq.
Both law firms were involved in interviewing present and former employees of AWB and AWBI.
In about February 2005, AWB retained ABL to act for it in relation to the IIC investigation and subsequently in relation to the Commission.
Throughout 2005, ABL worked closely in conjunction with Blakes and Minters.
All three firms were involved in analysing and reviewing the facts and obtaining evidence from potential witnesses, with a view to determining whether there was any evidence that AWB or its employees had made payments to Iraq in breach of the United Nations' sanctions or engaged in any other wrongdoing in connection with the OFF Programme.
The evidence does not contain any letters of retainer, or any other documentary record of the precise scope of the retainers, under which the three firms acted for AWB.
The affidavit evidence contains the briefest description of each retainer.
The work performed by the three firms overlapped very substantially and, if there were any lines of demarcation, they were very blurred.
Nonetheless, the scope of the work performed by each firm can be discerned with reasonable clarity from the affidavit evidence and the documents referred to in AWB's revised list of documents.
I am satisfied that Blakes, Minters and ABL were engaged professionally to provide legal advice and assistance within the scope of their respective retainers as described above.
In each relevant context, I consider that it would be inappropriate and artificial to attempt to sever the factual investigations carried out by the lawyers from the legal advice they provided under their retainers.
As I have said, a key purpose of those factual investigations was to enable Blakes, Minters and ABL to determine whether there was any evidence that AWB, or any of its employees, had made payments to Iraq in breach of the sanctions or engaged in any other wrongdoing in connection with its sale of wheat to Iraq.
By that means, the three law firms placed themselves in a position to advise AWB as to the risks it confronted and the course of action it should take in relation to the investigations.
I do not see any reason why professional communications between AWB and its lawyers concerning the investigations by the IIC, the PSI, and the Commission should be incapable of attracting legal advice privilege.
In these contexts, the concept of legal advice includes advice as to what AWB should prudently and sensibly do in connection with the relevant investigation.
Advice of this kind is capable of attracting legal advice privilege, notwithstanding that a particular communication is part of a continuum and does itself contain any specific advice on matters of law or any specific request for such advice.
AWB'S AFFIDAVIT EVIDENCE The Commonwealth contended that AWB had failed in its attempt to prove legal professional privilege because it had not adduced any proof as to AWB's dominant purpose in seeking or obtaining legal advice.
AWB largely relied upon evidence given by in-house and external lawyers involved in the particular communications at issue.
The Commonwealth submitted that evidence proving the lawyer's understanding of the purpose of the particular communication and that he or she was giving legal advice affords no evidence of the client's dominant purpose.
There is no real substance in this criticism.
Dominant purpose must be determined objectively, but it is not uncommon for the relevant purpose to be established by evidence given by the maker of the statement or another person responsible for commissioning the relevant document or bringing it into existence, such as a solicitor: see Mitsubishi Electric Australia Pty Ltd v Victoria WorkCover Authority [2002] VSCA 59 ; (2002) 4 VR 332 at [14] ; Grant v Downs at 677 and AWB v Cole at [110].
The Commonwealth objected to the admissibility of statements in AWB's affidavits where the deponent asserted that particular documents recorded 'legal' advice or were brought into existence for the purpose of obtaining, or giving, 'legal' advice.
It submitted that the description 'legal' was a conclusionary assertion or opinion based on other facts and circumstances that were not disclosed by the deponent.
AWB argued that the word 'legal' ought to be received on the ground that it was an opinion or description about the relevant facts and circumstances as perceived by the deponent.
Alternatively, where the deponent was legally qualified, AWB argued that the description represented an opinion that was based on the deponent's specialised knowledge, training and experience within the meaning of s 79 of the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth).
After hearing submissions from counsel, I ruled that I would not exclude the word 'legal' where it was used by a lawyer to characterise the relevant advice or communication.
In those circumstances, the presumption referred to in Kennedy v Wallace would be available: see [44] (4) above.
In addition, the description would, I think, be admissible as an opinion, based on specialised knowledge, within the meaning of s 79 of the Evidence Act .
On the other hand, I rejected the term 'legal' in affidavits where the deponent was not legally qualified.
In those affidavits, the use of the term amounted simply to a conclusion or opinion by a lay person that was based, in most instances, on facts which were not fully disclosed in the affidavit.
Further, I held that the evidence was not admissible under s 78 of the Evidence Act ; that provision is concerned with lay perceptions of things or events, such as a person's apparent age or state of intoxication: see S Odgers, Uniform Evidence Law, 7 th edn, Lawbook, 2006, pp 281-282.
At the time I made this ruling, I observed that where I had not struck the expression 'legal' from the affidavits, the weight that would be attached to that description in any particular affidavit would depend on the circumstances in which the communication took place; the description might be entitled to little or no weight in the absence of further evidence as to the circumstances surrounding the relevant communications or the topics to which the advice was directed: see Kennedy v Wallace at 189---190 [12]---[17] and 211---212 [144]---[145] and 215---216 [166]---[171].
DOES PRIVILEGE ATTACH?
During the course of the hearing, AWB and the Commonwealth reduced the number of documents which are in contest.
On the first day of the hearing, AWB announced that it no longer pressed for a declaration of privilege in respect of a significant number of documents in its list.
In doing so, AWB did not concede that the documents are not protected by legal professional privilege.
As finally revised, those documents are as follows: 27-29, 37-39A, 43, 53, 54, 61, 73-76, 109, 118, 119A, 125, 134, 141, 142, 146A-149, 153, 191-193, 195, 198, 202, 203, 212, 214, 216, 223, 236, 242-244, 248, 249, 272, 287, 289, 312, 314, 325, 328, 329, 335, 360, 363, 364, 366, 367, 369-373, 383, 396, 397, 409, 411, 415, 429, 458, 466, 469, 474, 489, 512, 528, 531, 532, 535, 540A, 545, 546, 597, 598, 604, 606-670, 673, 674, 676, 677, 678, 680, 682-689, 690, 692, 693, 695, 697, 698, 705, 716-720, 723, 726, 728, 734, 735, 746, 750, 767, 774, 776, 778, 782, 783, 786, 789, 791, 793, 795, 796, 803, 805, 825, 832-834, 836, 838, 839, 841-846, 848, 853-855, 858, 859, 862, 864, 871, 874, 875, 878, 880, 884, 886, 890, 890AO, 896, 897, 916, 917, 920, 922, 926, 927, 937, 938-941, 943-946, 949, 954-955, 967-969, 993, 993A, 996, 999, 1007-1008, 1010, 1014-1024, 1027, 1034-1050, 1052-1055, 1057-1058, 1060-1069, 1072, 1082, 1084-1085, 1102-1111, 1113B, 1122, 1125-1143, 1153, 1154, 1156, 1157, 1164-1182, 1188, 1189, 1203, 1205, 1208, 1210, 1211, 1220, 1223, 1224, 1241, 1242, 1263-1292, 1294, 1295 and 1298.
Both AWB and the Commonwealth submitted that the consequence of AWB's announcement was that the Court need not made any ruling as to the status of these documents.
Many of the documents relate to the Tigris transaction.
In paragraphs [90]-[108] of its written submissions, which were filed shortly before the commencement of the trial, the Commonwealth argued that all of the documents in AWB's revised list that recorded any legal advice in relation to the Tigris transaction attracted the fraud exception to legal professional privilege.
Alternatively, it submitted that any privilege attaching to those documents had been waived by AWB.
Following AWB's announcement, the Commonwealth and AWB also submitted that the Court need not consider or rule upon any of the arguments raised in paragraphs [90]-[108] of its written submissions.
On the joint submission of AWB and the Commonwealth, I made an order that paragraphs [90]-[108] should be excised from the Commonwealth's written submissions when those submissions were made available by the Court for public inspection.
The Commonwealth accepted AWB's claim to legal professional privilege over a number of the documents in the list.
The documents are as follows: 1-11, 13, 16-19, 23-25, 34-36, 40, 42, 44-52, 57-60, 62-72, 80, 86-88, 99, 128, 511, 891-895, 898-915, 918, 919, 921, 923-925, 928-936, 937AA-937AI, 937AK-937AO, 1100, 1101, 1191-1194, 1197-1199, 1201, 1202, 1204, 1207, 1209, 1212, 1216, 1217, 1219, 1227, 1228, 1230, 1233, 1235, 1236, 1238, 1244, 1245, 1251, 1253, 1254, 1257-1259, 1296 and 1302-1304.
The remainder of the documents in AWB's revised list are in issue.
The Commonwealth submitted that in respect of a number of documents (eg 1190 and following), it understood AWB to be contending those documents were listed as privileged documents in error because they are not within the scope of existing notices to produce.
Although the basis for this 'understanding' was never identified, the Commonwealth submitted that the question whether these documents fall within the scope of the notices is not before the Court and, accordingly, the privileged status of those documents does not arise for determination in these proceedings.
I do not agree.
On the material before the Court, I am bound to proceed on the basis that, but for the documents that are no longer pressed and those that are conceded, AWB seeks a declaration over all of the documents in its list because they fall, or may fall, within the scope of notices to produce issued by the first respondent.
In determining claims of legal professional privilege, the Court will look to the substance of the matter, having regard to the context, the nature of the document, the evidence that is led in support of the claim of privilege, any cross-examination of the claimant's witnesses and, if necessary, the content of the document as revealed by inspection.
The documents over which AWB claims privilege can be categorised in various ways, such as communications to and from Blakes, or Minters, or ABL containing legal advice; information obtained from AWB's records and employees by AWB's in-house counsel for the purpose of giving or obtaining legal advice; instructions provided by the in-house lawyers to external lawyers for the purpose of obtaining legal advice; and documents brought into existence by lawyers so as to assist them in the provision of legal advice.
But, ultimately, the categories provide limited assistance.
It is necessary to examine the evidence concerning each relevant document over which privilege is claimed and to examine that evidence in the light of the relevant context.
I have also inspected each of the original documents over which AWB has claimed privilege.
Applying the legal principles discussed above, I have identified the documents which, in my view, have not been proven to be the subject of legal professional privilege.
I will defer listing these documents at this stage, as many of them are affected by the waiver issue.
I will need to consider waiver and the fraud exception before I express any view about the remaining documents.
My conclusions, listing each affected document, are set out towards the end of these reasons.
AWB'S DISCLOSURES IN RELATION TO PROJECT ROSE The Commonwealth contends that AWB has waived privilege in relation to its Project Rose documentation by reason of: (1) the disclosures by Hargreaves and other AWB executives to the Australian Government from 24 March 2005 onwards; (2) the disclosures by Lindberg to the IIC in the course of his interview with IIC investigators on 28 February 2005; (3) its production of various documents to the Commission under notices to produce after waiving claims of legal professional privilege, including legal advice that Blakes gave to AWB's board of directors on 25 May 2004, instructions given to, and advices obtained from, Mr Tracey QC in the period from May 2004 to August 2005, and the instructions given to, and the expert opinion obtained from, Sir Anthony Mason AC KBE in relation to the applicability of Resolution 661; and (4) the evidence that Lindberg gave to the Commission in the course of its public hearings.
In the paragraphs that follow, I have set out my factual findings concerning these disclosures.
DISCLOSURES BY HARGREAVES Peter Hargreaves ('Hargreaves') was a senior executive of AWB who acted as the manager of Project Rose.
On 24 March 2005, Hargreaves made a power point presentation to officers of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade ('the Department') in Canberra that reported on the IIC visit to AWB in February 2005.
It contained references to the results of AWB's own legal review: 
 
 Response 
 
 AWB interviewees told the IIC that we believe our trade with Iraq was undertaken in accordance with UN guidelines throughout the life of the OFF Program they had no knowledge that Alia might have an ownership connection back to the old regime.
Alia was regarded as a company providing a genuine service which saved Australian wheat growers considerable demurrage costs, and They only became aware of a possible connection when the allegations were raised in the media well after the OFF Program ended.
Advised IIC that AWB's own legal review had found no evidence of: corruption by AWB or individuals side payments or after sales payments to individuals of the former regime, or payments by the regime to former or existing AWB representatives IIC advised they had found no evidence to the contrary.

 
 ... 
 
 --- inland trucking arrangements 
 
 seems designed to establish whether, through the use of Alia, AWB had wittingly or unwittingly paid money to the Government of Iraq in violation of the Security Council Resolutions 661 and 986.

 
 also sought to establish: 
 
 How much did AWB know about the background of Alia?
AWB representatives assured the IIC they knew nothing of any connection between Alia and the former regime until well after the OFF Program ended and allegations first began to appear in the media Unreasonable expectation should AWB have known or inquired of any connection with the former regime?
AWB saw nothing untoward --- paying for a service that was genuinely needed to improve efficiency of humanitarian program --- also reduced demurrage --- a big cost to growers It was no secret the Iraqis were paying for inland trucking --- it was stated on the contracts UN contractors Contechna were inspecting the port operation including the discharge into Alia trucks No concerns were raised with AWB by the UN, Contechna or any other body throughout the life of the OFF Program Was AWB aware of any payments being channelled from Alia to the old regime?
No and subsequent legal review has found no evidence to the contrary 
 
 ... 
 
 of Corrupt Payments: 
 
 legal review had found no evidence of: 
 
 Corruption by AWB or individuals Side payments or after sales payments to individuals of the former regime, or Payments by the regime to former or existing AWB representatives 
 
 IIC advised they had found no evidence to the contrary'.

 
 On 20 April 2005, Hargreaves attended at the Australian Embassy in Washington DC to brief Ambassador Michael Thawley and members of his staff.
The uncontested evidence before me includes a statutory declaration by Anastasia Carayanides, a Minister Counsellor (Commercial) at the Embassy in Washington, who attended the briefing by Hargreaves.
The statutory declaration records that Hargreaves made statements to the following effect: 
 
 "I think that AWB has cooperated with the IIC and that the IIC now has a better appreciation of AWB operations under OFF.
AWB has not been involved in paying bribes in Iraq.
I think the IIC will conclude that AWB was not knowingly involved in breaching sanctions, or at worst that it was unwittingly involved.
" When someone asked what he meant by that statement, he replied in words to the following effect: "The IIC is looking at the use of a fictitious trucking company.
But I'm confident that AWB does not fall in that category.
" To my knowledge, Mr Hargreaves referred to Alia by name for the first time either in this meeting or in the meeting on 15 June 2005 (see paras 36-37 below).
' 
 
 Hargreaves made a further presentation to Embassy staff on 15 June 2005 at which Hargreaves told Ms Carayanides and others that: 
 
 "I can assure you that AWB has not been involved in any illicit payments to the Iraqi regime or breaches of sanctions.
AWB has conducted an internal audit and an independent legal review by a law firm, and both had found no wrongdoing.
" ... 
 
 has done nothing wrong.
It has not been involved in breaking sanctions.
All of AWB's contracts were approved by the UN.
No-one in AWB is aware of paying kickbacks to Iraq.
" ... 
 
 is a Jordanian trucking company that provided real trucking services to AWB in Iraq.
Alia unloaded ships at Umm Qasr directly on to its trucks and delivered the wheat throughout the country.
As far as AWB knew Alia was not a front company.
AWB was not aware of Alia channelling money to Iraq".
' 
 
 On 25 June 2005, in consultation with AWB's legal advisers, Hargreaves prepared a memorandum for Lindberg to speak to at a board meeting of AWB that was scheduled for 28 June 2005.
The memorandum apprised board members of meetings which AWB had held with key elements of the Federal Government, including the Australian Embassy in Washington, and expanded on those meetings as follows: 
 
 with Federal Government 
 
 Chairman and MD met with PM's office --- senior Foreign Affairs Advisor John Anderson and his chief of staff Alexander Downer Warren Truss Heads and other officials of DFAT and DAFF 
 
 
 
 Provided briefing on progress so far with IIC and our deep concern over AWB's treatment so far and that AWB might become victim of its cooperation Alerted them to possibility of adverse [findings] including possibility of finding AWB has wilfully breached sanctions through the trucking arrangements Sought their advice on impact if AWB withdrew from process Reassured them that: AWB has QC's opinion it has not breached sanctions AWB complied with the guidelines laid down by the relevant authorities AWB had no knowledge of any connection between the trucking company and the former regime during the OFF program AWB has found no evidence of fraud or corrupt payments etc 
 
 
 
 Overall the meetings were very satisfactory for AWB 
 
 
 
 While there is concern over damage to reputation of Australia and AWB, the feedback from all parties was: AWB should continue to engage in the process That Fed Gov't is ready to back AWB but this would be difficult if AWB withdraws from process No indication from any individual or any meeting that Fed Gov't was distancing itself from AWB in this process Strong support came from Minister Downer who indicated he saw it as his responsibility to defend AWB Their view of the facts was that: AWB had followed the process AWB did what it was instructed to do AWB did not know, could not have known of any connection between the trucking company and the former regime.
' 
 
 
 
 Later in the memorandum, Hargreaves identified the commercial objectives which AWB was pursuing: 
 
 objectives 
 
 Protect and defend the reputation of AWB both within Australia and overseas To minimize any attack by US wheat interests on the single desk selling system arising from this report To manage the media, politics in Canberra and domestic stakeholders in order to avoid any need for a further inquiry into AWB's role in OFF To manage the media and politics in the United States with the aim of containing this issue and preventing our involvement in the OFF Program from becoming the subject of inquiry by Congressional Committees Avoiding any impact on our relationship with Iraq or other customers.
' 
 
 
 
 Hargreaves had a further meeting in Washington DC with Ms Carayanides at some time in the period between 16 June 2005 and September 2005.
In the course of this meeting, Hargreaves was asked whether the amount paid by AWB to Alia for trucking services was reasonable.
Ms Carayanides said that he responded in words to the following effect: 
 
 he thought it was reasonable, because it reflected the costs of insurance and transportation throughout the country in difficult circumstances.
Alia was providing a real service, and AWB was paying for that service.
It was the only trucking company that was reliable and that AWB could use to off load wheat into trucks at Umm Qasr.
No one in AWB knew of any money being channeled to the Iraqi regime through Alia.
AWB had conducted an independent legal review which hadn't turned up any wrongdoing".
' 
 
 DISCLOSURES TO THE IIC On 28 February 2005, Lindberg was interviewed by several investigators from the IIC.
The interview was also attended by Cooper and Leonie Thompson of ABL.
The record of interview, as subsequently revised by Lindberg and AWB's lawyers, sets out the following exchange between Lindberg and an IIC investigator: 
 
 investigator said] 'that it appeared that AWB had "dismissed" media reports that accused the company of engaging in sanctions-busting.
[ No basis was given for the assumption that AWB had been dismissive as alleged ].
He asked LINDBERG what actions AWB had taken to determine if there existed any truth to these allegations.
LINDBERG said that he had asked COOPER to conduct a "legal review" and that COOPER had assembled a team to look into the matter.
The review, LINDBERG said, had found nothing that would substantiate claims of fraud or corruption and had identified no payments to individuals in the Government of Iraq by AWB or vice-versa.
LINDBERG said that AWB would "obviously" have been concerned had COOPER's team uncovered evidence of improper or unlawful conduct.
' 
 

Later in the interview, Lindberg said that AWB would certainly have taken corrective action had it uncovered evidence suggesting possible fraud or corruption, but no such evidence had come to light.
Apparently, the IIC investigators interviewed a number of other AWB officers and employees, but their records of interview have not been tendered in evidence before me.
AWB made its executives available for interview by the IIC, and also made documents available for inspection by the IIC, under the terms of a Memorandum of Understanding between the IIC and AWB dated 25/26 February 2005.
The Memorandum records that AWB agreed to cooperate with the IIC and to disclose information in accordance with its terms.
Relevantly, the Memorandum provided: 
 
 Document Production and Confidentiality --- AWB will provide the IIC with access to the scheduled AWB documents (see attached).
The IIC may request, in writing, further documents that it considers relevant.
In responding to the IIC's document requests, AWB has advised that it may take into account that certain documents may be commercially sensitive, subject to legal professional privilege, or expose AWB or its employees, officers, or representatives (past or present) to breaches of Australian law.
In the event that AWB decides to withhold documents for any of the aforementioned reasons, it will so advise the IIC in writing, and the parties may agree to additional terms for production.
The IIC's review of all documents provided by AWB will be governed by the AWB Data Room Protocol, a copy of which is attached to this memorandum.
At the IIC's request, except in exceptional circumstances (addressed further in paragraph 7), AWB will furnish the IIC with copies of documents that the IIC reviews in the AWB Data Room and determines are necessary for purposes of its inquiry.
The IIC will maintain in strict confidence the documents provided by AWB, and it will not provide copies of the documents to third parties.
However, AWB agrees that the IIC may use documents provided by AWB for the purposes of its investigation and for any report.
... 
 
 Witness Interviews and Confidentiality --- The IIC will maintain in strict confidence the information gathered in the course of these interviews, and it will not provide any records of this information to third parties.
However, AWB agrees that the IIC may use information that it gathers in the course of AWB interviews as well as the fact of these interviews for the purposes of its investigation and for any report.
The IIC will provide AWB with reasonable notice of its request to interview any current AWB employee, officer, or representative as well as reasonable notice of any former AWB employee, officer, or representative for whom the IIC desires AWB's assistance in locating and interviewing.
With respect to the IIC's interview of a person who worked for AWB in connection with the Programme, the parties understand that each interview will be on the record and for attribution.
In advance of the interview, the IIC will submit a list of the subject areas to be addressed with the witness.
At each interview, two representatives of the IIC will be present.
A witness may have --- at the witness's choosing --- a personal legal counsel.
In addition, if the witness agrees, up to two representatives of AWB may be present at each interview.
A witness will advise the IIC prior to the interview who will be present on his behalf.

 DISCLOSURES TO THE MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS On 4 October 2005, a conversation took place between Lindberg, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Honourable Alexander Downer MP, Brendan Stewart, the chairman of AWB, and others.
A minute of this meeting prepared by the Department states: 
 
 Mr Downer said the IIC allegations were worse than he had thought.
There was evidence presented by the IIC in the most recent letter.
Mr Downer noted the letter claimed that Alia was a front company.
He enquired what was the role of the Iraqi State Company for Water Transport (ISCWT).
Mr Lindberg replied it was the port authority, which had responsibility for discharging goods from ships.
Alia was not a front company and had provided transportation services.
The AWB had been unaware of any wrongdoing and had used its services in good faith.
Mr Downer said AWB needed to provide evidence.
Mr Lindberg said AWB had been seeking additional information from the IIC about the claims, before providing a written response to the 26 September letter.
The so-called evidence did not support the facts.
AWB had provided explanations to the IIC which had been ignored.
AWB could demonstrate that it had paid no kickbacks.
Nor had AWB breached the sanctions regime.
This had been confirmed by independent legal advice both in Australia and overseas (Richard Tracy in Australia and a Cornell University Professor who had previously participated in drafting the sanctions regime).
' 
 

The minute also records that later in the meeting Lindberg reiterated that 'as far as AWB was aware, no one had been paid off nor any personal gain.
AWB had acted in accordance with the sanctions regime and that this had been supported by legal advice.
'
 AWB objected to the admissibility of the Department's minute on the ground that the statements contained in it were hearsay.
There is, in my view, no substance in this objection.
The document constitutes a business record which is admissible under s 69 of the Evidence Act .
The definition of 'business' in clause 1(1) of Part 2 of the Schedule to the Evidence Act includes an activity engaged in or carried on by the Crown in any of its capacities.
The document was tendered by the Commonwealth as evidence of the fact that the statements it records were made by Lindberg.
The minute was prepared by Marc Innes-Brown, the head of the Department's Iraq Task Force, who was present at the meeting.
The representation in the minute that Lindberg made the statements attributed to him was therefore made by a person who had personal knowledge of what statements were made by Lindberg.
Lindberg was questioned about the minute at the Commission and did not dispute its accuracy in any respect.
BLAKES' SLIDE PRESENTATION I have already referred to the presentation which Blakes made to AWB's board on 25 May 2004.
The slides recording Blakes' presentation were originally withheld from production to the Commission on grounds of legal professional privilege.
The objection was withdrawn in two stages.
First, on or shortly before 6 April 2006, AWB withdrew its claim for legal professional privilege over the presentation, other than one page headed 'Legal advice'.
This page set out the advice given by Mr Tracey QC in conference on 25 May 2004.
On 7 April 2006, AWB withdrew the balance of the claim, basically because of the presentations which Hargreaves made to the Australian Government.
SENIOR COUNSEL'S ADVICE When AWB revised its privilege claims and produced Blakes' presentation to the Commission, it also produced a memorandum of advice by Mr Tracey QC dated 12 August 2005 confirming the advice he gave in conference on 25 May 2004, together with the instructions and bundle of documents on which he founded that advice.
Mr Judd, senior counsel for AWB, informed the Commission that AWB had taken the view that, as Mr Tracey QC's advice was based upon a review of documents, and turned on the question whether or not the documents disclosed evidence, the advice could not be separated from the documents.
Therefore, AWB had determined to produce the bundle of material on which Mr Tracey QC had based his advice.
Mr Tracey QC's instructions from Blakes were dated 12 May 2000 but this appears to be an obvious error; the date should have read 12 May 2004.
They requested him to advise whether, based on the documents and information provided to him, AWB and AWBI may have contributed to a contravention by Australia of its obligations under Resolution 661 or contravened any Commonwealth or State legislation.
In the instructions to counsel, Blakes said that it had deliberately included a significant number of AWB's documents for 1999 and 2000 as this was the key period during which the trucking fee was discussed.
The documents included correspondence between AWB and GBI, AWB and other participants in the Iraqi wheat market, AWB and various shipping companies engaged to perform the ocean carriage of the wheat, and AWB and the Department.
The instructions set out extracts from a number of AWB documents which, according to Blakes, contained comments as to the validity or otherwise of AWB's payment of trucking fees to Alia.
The instructions discussed the genesis of AWB's payment of trucking fees to Alia.
GBI's invitation to AWB to tender dated 16 July 1999 requested a new price provision in the following terms: 
 
 --- PRICE 
 
 free on truck to silo at all Governarate [sic] .
Cost of discharge at Umm Qaser and land transport will be USD 12 per metric ton to be paid to the land transport co. For more details contact Iraqi Maritin [sic] in Basrah.
"' 
 
 The instructions noted that AWB included a clause in broadly this form in its contracts A4653, A4654 and A4655 (all dated 14 July 1999) and A4822 (dated 14 October 1999).
For instance, contract A4653 included the following terms as to shipment and price: 
 
 To be shipped during 01 October 1999 to 31 December 1999 subject to receipt of appropriate UN approval.

 
 ... 
 
 cargo will be discharged Free in to Truck to all silos within all Governates of Iraq at the average rate of ...
The discharge cost will be a maximum of US$12.00 and shall be paid by sellers to the nominated Maritime Agents in Iraq.
This clause is subject to UN approval of the Iraq distribution plan.

 
 The CIF, Free in Truck price per tonne of 1,000 kilos is ... UNITED [States] of America dollars as follows:' 
 
 
 

In these contracts, the discharge cost of US$12 pmt was added to the sale price of the wheat but the contract made no specific reference to 'land transport'.
The instructions also stated that subsequent contracts between AWB and GBI (eg A4970, A4971 and A4972 dated 20 January 2000) continued to include a provision to the effect that the discharge costs would be a maximum amount (eg US$15 pmt) and was to be paid by the sellers to the nominated maritime agents in Iraq.
However, the signed contracts that were submitted to the United Nations (eg A4970, A4971 and A4972) did not include the above provision.
Omitting any reference to discharge costs, the shipment clause in the contract submitted to the United Nations merely stated that the 'cargo will be discharged free into truck to all silos within all Governates of Iraq at the average rate of 3,000 mt per day.
' From January 2000, all AWB contracts submitted to the United Nations followed the same format and made no specific reference to the payment of a discharge cost or a trucking fee.
The instructions also said that the trucking fee in respect of contracts A4653, A4654, A4655 and A4822 was paid directly by AWB to Alia.
For a time thereafter, payment of the trucking fee was effected by whichever shipping company had undertaken to provide the ocean carriage.
However, after 25 July 2000 the procedure was then changed so that AWB remitted the funds direct to Alia.
The instructions then set out the following observations: 
 
 Comments on the "trucking fee" 
 
 documents which instructing solicitors have examined do not indicate whether the trucking fees paid by AWB to Alia can be regarded as a genuine payment for the provision of inland freight services actually provided by Alia.
We have not seen any contract between AWB and Alia.
We have seen no evidence to indicate whether or not the trucks used to transport wheat after its discharge at Umm Qasr were provided by Alia.
We have seen no explanation as to how the trucking fee was calculated or the basis upon which the trucking fee was subsequently increased.
The trucking fee does not appear to have been calculated with regard to the differing distances between Umm Qasr and the various Governorates [sic] (cf.
Tab 14).
' 
 
 In his memorandum of 12 August 2005 confirming his oral advice given in conference on 25 May 2004, Mr Tracey QC discussed his instructions and the documentary evidence provided to him.
Mr Tracey QC concluded as follows: 
 
 however, the question that I was asked to advise on was whether there was evidence that AWB may have contributed to a contravention by Australia of its obligations under Resolution 661.
A breach of that resolution would only have occurred if the trucking fees had been paid to the IGB or the Iraqi Government and then only if it was not paid for a legitimate commercial purpose.
Whilst some of the material with which I have been briefed raises suspicions that there may have been a perception within the AWB that any payment of the trucking fee may have contravened Resolution 661 and that it was necessary to make the payment to Alia in order to avoid any suggestion that the payments, if made directly to the IGB, would have been in breach of the Resolution, there is absolutely no evidence in the material provided to me that any of the money paid by the AWB to Alia was ever forwarded to the IGB or any other arm of the Iraqi government.
It was for this reason, that, despite some misgivings I answered the question posed for advice in the negative.
' 
 
 Additional advice was sought from Mr Tracey QC in about June 2004.
On this occasion, Blakes instructed Mr Tracey QC that it had now ascertained the basis of calculation of the increase in trucking fees that was applied to AWB's contracts after 2 November 2000.
Specifically, Blakes instructed Mr Tracey QC that an additional 10 per cent had been added to the price of wheat by way of an increase in the trucking fee.
All subsequent contracts were priced on the same basis, ie a base price inclusive of a trucking fee, with 10 per cent of the base price then being added to the trucking fee.
Mr Tracey QC was asked to advise whether his previous advice, to the effect that there was no evidence of a breach of the relevant UN resolution on sanctions, and no evidence of a breach by AWB of Australian domestic law, remained unchanged.
After Mr Tracey QC raised some queries, Quennell provided supplementary instructions as follows: 
 
 each and every contract pursuant to which AWB supplied wheat to the Grain Board of Iraq under the Oil for Food Program was approved by the UN Committee; however, the price of the wheat as expressed in the contract was not broken down so as to identify the different components of the price, eg ocean freight and inland transport costs; 
 
 there was no apparent commercial justification for the increase; 
 
 ... 
 
 the circumstances please advise on the above basis.
' 
 
 On 8 June 2004, Mr Tracey QC provided the following advice by email to Quennell: 
 
 the absence of commercial justification for the introduction, increases and decreases in the trucking fee and the lack of specific approval for the fee and its quantum by the UN there is reason to suspect that the fee (or part of it) was used as a kick-back to the IGB or persons associated with it.
Whether the money was so used can only be determined by an investigation of the finances of the Jordianian trucking company which was the recipient of the trucking fees.

 
 further reason for suspecting the efficacy of the fee is Hogan's assertion that UN approval for its payment had been obtained.
If this was not the case then a question arises as to why the assertion was made.
Was it a deliberate attempt to mislead AWB management or did he make an honest mistake?

 
 of this establishes that the AWB or any of its employees is guilty of any offence or of breaching UN resolutions.
What it does suggest is the need for further enquiries (if this is possible) to determine all the facts surrounding the payment of the trucking fee and, in particular, whether any part of it found its way to the IGB or any Iraqi officials.
' 
 
 These communications between Blakes and senior counsel were marked 'RE: Project Rose'.
They were produced to the Commission after AWB determined that privilege over the documents had been waived by Hargreaves' disclosures to the Australian Government.
Mr Tracey QC provided a further memorandum of advice on 31 March 2005 confirming oral advice which he provided to his instructors the previous day.
This memorandum is headed 'Re AWB Limited --- Project Rose', and states: 
 
 This memorandum confirms oral advice provided to my instructor yesterday.

 
 I have been briefed with a series of documents which evidence various transactions and arrangements entered into by AWB Limited relating to the sale by it of wheat to Iraq.
I have been asked to examine these documents with a view to advising whether the contents of any of them lead me to change [my] earlier advice that, on material earlier examined, there was no evidence of a breach by Australia (as a result of conduct by AWB) of UN Resolution 661 and no evidence of a breach by AWB, its officers and/or employees of Australian domestic law.

 
 
 
 I confirm that there is nothing in the documents which causes me to vary advice earlier given.

 
 
 
 There are some documents (for example the emails under tab 8A) which suggest that AWB paid port fees at the rate of US$1,500 per vessel in 2001 and that such payments were "technically in breach of sanctions".
The payments were known to the UN Sanctions Committee and to the Australian Mission to the United Nations.
AWB was advised by the Australian Mission that this fee for normal port agency services did not violate current sanctions procedures.
In confirming my earlier advice about breaches of Security Council Resolution 661 I have assumed that this advice was correct.

 
 
 
 Some of the documents also contain evidence of attempts by Iraqi Government agencies to obtain direct payment for port fees and payments through Alia for inland transportation (for example, faxes under tabs 8, 9 and 14).
The terms of these communications add to the concern which I expressed in my email of 8 June 2004.
However, I note my instructions that there is no evidence of any payments of the kind contemplated in the documents briefed having been made.
