In this judgment I shall refer to Mr Worchild as 'the appellant' and The Drink Nightclub (Qld) Pty Ltd and Mr Cross as 'the respondents'.

 BACKGROUND 
 
 4 This matter is complicated by the number of related claims and appeals.
In summary: 1.
The genesis of this matter was proceedings commenced by the appellant against the respondents in the Federal Court of Australia in November 2003.
The appellant claimed contraventions of the Trade Practices Act 1975 (Cth) in respect of the respondents' alleged refusal to honour a promotional card sold to the appellant by the Queensland University of Technology Association of Law Students.
Those proceedings were heard and summarily dismissed by Cooper J on 24 May 2004 ( Worchild v The Drink Nightclub (Qld) Pty Ltd [2004] FCA 642).
His Honour ordered that the appellant pay the respondents' costs of and incidental to the proceedings.
2.
On 20 September 2004, an estimate of the respondents' bill of costs arising out of the decision of Cooper J was made pursuant to the provisions of O 62 r 46 Federal Court Rules and allowed in the sum of $24 000.00, for which sum a Certificate of Taxation was issued on 12 October 2004.
3.
On 26 November 2004 Deputy District Registrar Baldwin in the Federal Court made an order that the appellant pay the sum of $24 000.00 to the respondents.
4.
Bankruptcy Notice Q/N1238/2004 ('the bankruptcy notice') identifying the appellant as the debtor was issued by the Official Receiver on 15 December 2004.
The bankruptcy notice was issued in relation to the appellant's failure to pay the respondents in accordance with the costs order of Deputy District Registrar Baldwin of 26 November 2004.
5.
On 21 January 2005 the respondents served the bankruptcy notice on the appellant.
6.
On 13 May 2005 before Deputy District Registrar Baldwin in the Federal Court the appellant sought to have the bankruptcy notice set aside.
The appellant was unsuccessful and he was ordered to pay costs in the amount of $2500.
The appellant unsuccessfully appealed this decision of the Deputy District Registrar ( Worchild v The Drink Nightclub (Qld) Pty Ltd ACN 090 830 854, in the matter of Worchild [2005] FCA 863 per Dowsett J), and then again unsuccessfully to the Full Court of the Federal Court ( Worchild v The Drink Nightclub (Qld) Pty Ltd [2005] FCAFC 240).
As at the date of the hearing the appellant had sought special leave to appeal to the High Court from the decision of the Full Court.
(I understand that special leave to appeal was refused: Worchild v The Drink Nightclub (Qld) Pty Ltd [2006] HCA Trans 223.
) 7.
On 3 June 2005, the respondents filed a creditor's petition in the Federal Magistrates Court applying for a sequestration order under s 43 Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth) (' Bankruptcy Act ') against the estate of the appellant in respect of the debt of $24 000.00 owing to them under the order of Deputy District Registrar Baldwin in the Federal Court of 26 November 2004.
The document was accompanied by an affidavit of the second respondent sworn 31 May 2005, deposing that he had access to the books and records of the first respondent, and that the appellant had not paid, nor made arrangements to the satisfaction of the respondents for the settlement of the debt claimed in the bankruptcy notice.
8.
On 20 June 2005 the appellant filed and served a Notice of Intention to Oppose the Petition in the Federal Magistrates Court.
9.
The petition came before District Registrar Ramsey in the Federal Magistrates Court on 24 June 2005, however the Registrar directed that the matter be adjourned for hearing before a Federal Magistrate at 10.15 am on 26 August 2005.
The matter then came before Rimmer FM.

 DECISION OF RIMMER FM 
 
 5 After setting out the facts of the case and explaining the statutory framework, Rimmer FM noted that the key issue was the regularity of the creditor's petition presented by the respondents.
