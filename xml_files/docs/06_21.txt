 
 1 On 21 December 2001 I ordered that the application brought by the applicant ("the Commission") against the first respondent ("Safeway") and the third respondent ("Mr Jones") for contraventions of various provisions under Pt IV of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) ("the Act ") be dismissed: Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Australian Safeway Stores Pty Ltd (No 3) [2001] FCA 1861 ; (2001) 119 FCR 1.
On 22 October 2002 I ordered that the Commission pay Safeway and Mr Jones' costs of and incidental to the application.
The Commission appealed to the Full Court of the Federal Court and on 30 June 2003 the Full Court delivered judgment in the appeal, allowing it in part: Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Australian Safeway Stores Pty Ltd and Anor [2003] FCAFC 149 ; (2003) 129 FCR 339.
On 1 August 2003 the Full Court made orders giving effect to its earlier reasons.
2 The Commission, Safeway and Mr Jones filed applications with the High Court seeking special leave to appeal in respect of the judgment of the Full Court.
On 10 September 2004 the High Court refused those applications.
Consequently the orders of the Full Court remain in full force and effect.
3 Ten incidents involving allegations of contraventions of the Act had been raised before me.
Of those ten incidents the Full Court allowed the appeal in respect of five of them.
The Full Court made declarations that there had been five specific contraventions of the Act , ordered that the orders made on 21 December 2001 and 22 October 2002 be set aside and that the proceeding be remitted for further hearing and determination in relation to the imposition of pecuniary penalties in respect of the contraventions declared, injunctive relief, the liability of Mr Jones and the costs of the trial.
4 The Full Court made the following declarations:
 
 
 "1.
Declares that the first respondent by ceasing to acquire, display and sell bread products of Quality Bakers Australia Pty Ltd trading as Buttercup Bakeries ('Buttercup') at the first respondent's two supermarkets in the Karingal Hub Shopping Centre in Frankston: 
 
 1.1 from 16 May 1994 until 6 July 1994; 
 
 
 1.2 for the purpose of deterring Buttercup from selling Code C 680 gram plain wrap or generic bread branded 'Quadara' to the Quadara store in Ashleigh Street, Frankston ('the Quadara store') at a discounted price, 
 
 
 
 has taken advantage of its substantial degree of market power in the market in Victoria for the supply, on a wholesale basis, of bread to food retailers ('the wholesale bread market in Victoria') for the purpose of deterring or preventing Buttercup and the operator of the Quadara store from engaging in competitive conduct in the wholesale bread market in Victoria and the retail bread market in Frankston, respectively, in contravention of s 46(1)(c) of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) ('the Act ').

 
 
 
 
 
 2.
Declares that the first respondent by ceasing to acquire, display and sell Buttercup's bread products at the first respondent's Cheltenham supermarket at Southland Westfield Shoppingtown: 
 
 2.1 from 16 to 25 July 1994; 
 
 
 2.2 for the purpose of deterring Buttercup from selling Code C 680 gram bread branded 'Black  Gold' to Cheapa Food Barn at the Cheltenham Market at a discounted price, 
 
 
 
 has taken advantage of its substantial degree of market power in the wholesale bread market in Victoria for the purpose of deterring or preventing Buttercup and the operator of the Cheltenham Cheapa Food Barn from engaging in competitive conduct in the wholesale bread market in Victoria and the retail bread market in Cheltenham, respectively, in contravention of s 46(1)(c) of the Act .

 
 
 
 
 
 3.
Declares that the first respondent by ceasing to acquire, display and sell Buttercup's bread products at the first respondent's Vermont supermarket at Brentford Square shopping centre: 
 
 3.1 from 16 July 1994 to 25 October 1994; 
 
 
 3.2 for the purpose of deterring Buttercup from selling Code C 680 gram bread branded 'Black  Gold' to Cheapa Food Barn at Brentford Square shopping centre at a discounted price, 
 
 
 
 has taken advantage of its substantial degree of market power in the wholesale bread market in Victoria for the purpose of deterring or preventing Buttercup and the operator of the Vermont Cheapa Food Barn from engaging in competitive conduct in the wholesale bread market in Victoria and the retail bread market in Vermont, respectively, in contravention of s 46(1)(c) of the Act .

 
 
 
 
 
 4.
Declares that the first respondent by ceasing to acquire, display and sell bread products of George Weston Foods Ltd trading as Tip Top Bakeries ('Tip Top'): 
 
 
 
 4.1 from 10 to 14 May 1995 at the first respondent's Albury and Lavington supermarkets and from 12 to 14 May 1995 at the first respondent's Wodonga supermarket; 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 4.2 for the purpose of deterring Tip Top from selling 750 gram bread branded 'Mighty White' to Bob's IGA Festival Supermarket in David Street, Albury ('Bob's IGA') at a discounted price, 
 
 
 
 has taken advantage of its substantial degree of market power in the wholesale bread market in Victoria for the purpose of deterring or preventing Tip Top and the operator of the Bob's IGA from engaging in competitive conduct in the wholesale bread market in Victoria and the retail bread market in Albury, respectively, in contravention of s 46(1)(c) of the Act .

 
 
 
 
 
 5.
Declares that the first respondent by its arrangement or understanding with Tip Top made or arrived at on 27 and 28 April 1995 whereby Tip Top would sell at its Preston market stall Code C plain wrap bread at $1.50 per loaf and Code D plain wrap bread at $1.90 per loaf made an arrangement or arrived at an understanding that contained a provision having the purpose, or being likely to have the effect, of substantially lessening competition in contravention of s 45(2)(a)(ii) of the Act .
" 
 


 
5 When the remitted matters came on for hearing before me, injunctive relief and costs were no longer in issue.
The liability of Mr Jones in respect of the Frankston, Cheltenham, Vermont and Albury incidents ("the four incidents") was not pursued by the Commission.
Mr Jones accepted liability under s 76 of the Act in respect of Safeway's contravention of s 45(2)(a)(ii) of the Act in the Preston Market incident and agreed with the Commission in a joint submission to the Court that $30,000 was an appropriate penalty to be imposed.
The Commission and Mr Jones agreed to the Court making the following declaration:
 
 "... that on or about 27 and 28 April 1995 the third respondent was knowingly concerned in making or arriving at the arrangement or understanding between the first respondent and George Weston Foods Limited trading as 'Tip Top Bakeries' ('Tip Top') whereby Tip Top would sell at its Preston Market stall code C plain wrap bread at $1.50 per loaf and code D plain wrap bread at $1.90 per loaf, being an arrangement or understanding that contained a provision having the purpose, or being likely to have the effect, of substantially lessening competition in contravention of s 45(2)(a)(ii) of the ... Act ..." 


 
6 I do not propose to rehearse the factual background to, and findings in respect of, the various incidents or the circumstances in which each of them came about.
They are set out in my earlier reasons and in the reasons of the Full Court.
I do, however, refer to findings and conclusions of the Full Court which are relevant in the context of the penalties to be imposed.
7 In summary, the majority of the Full Court concluded that in relation to the four incidents involving deletions of bread products at Safeway supermarkets at Frankston, Vermont, Cheltenham and Albury, I had erred in not finding that Safeway had taken advantage of its market power in the wholesale bread market for a proscribed purpose, in contravention of s 46(1)(c) of the Act .
The majority of the Full Court reasoned at [333]-[334]:
 
 "[333] ...
In each of the four instances with which we are concerned Safeway deleted all or most of the plant baker's products from one of its supermarkets.
Its reason for doing so was to induce the plant baker to cease supplying discounted bread to an independent retailer in competition with a Safeway supermarket.
As we have explained, there would have been no purpose in Safeway acting in this manner in a competitive market.
On the contrary, had Safeway done so it would have inflicted economic harm on itself for no gain.
Safeway's conduct in the four instances was therefore materially facilitated by the existence of its market power even though that same conduct would not have been 'absolutely impossible' without that power.

 
 [334] For those reasons, we are satisfied that his Honour was in error in finding that Safeway did not take advantage of its power in the Wholesale Market.
" 


 
8 It was the unanimous view of the Full Court that in relation to the Preston Market incident I had erred in not finding that Safeway and Tip Top made an arrangement that contained a provision having the purpose or likely to have the effect of substantially lessening competition in a market in contravention of s 45(2)(a)(ii) of the Act .
The majority of the Full Court reasoned at [443]-[445]:
 
 "[443] An arrangement or understanding was made or reached between Mr Feldgen and Mr Lovett at the meetings of 27 and 28 April 1995.
The making or reaching of that arrangement or understanding was authorised by Mr Jones for Safeway and Mr Gunton for Tip Top.
Mr Feldgen and Mr Lovett had the necessary meeting of minds, as did Mr Jones and Mr Gunton.
This is not a case, for example, where the Safeway representatives had a mere hope or expectation that Tip Top would act in a particular way.
Safeway gave approval, through Mr Feldgen, for the prices to be charged at the Preston Market stall and in return Tip Top was readmitted as a supplier to Safeway Preston.

 
 [444] Although the primary Judge was not satisfied that Mr Feldgen and Mr Jones had the requisite intention to make an arrangement or arrive at an understanding, this finding seems to have been based on his view that Mr Jones had not instructed Mr Feldgen to meet Mr Lovett.
In any event, the critical question is whether an arrangement was made or an understanding arrived at between Safeway and Tip Top.
On the facts of this case it was.

 
 [445] Given that finding, there was no dispute that a provision of the arrangement or understanding had the purpose or was likely to have the effect of fixing, controlling or maintaining the price for bread supplied by Tip Top, one of the parties to the arrangement or understanding.
Accordingly, s 45A(1) of the Act deems the provision, for the purpose of s 45(2) , to have the purpose or to be likely to have the effect of substantially lessening competition.
It follows that the Commission has made out its case that Safeway contravened s 45(2)(a)(ii) of the Act by making an arrangement or arriving at an understanding having the purpose or likely to have the effect of substantially lessening competition.
