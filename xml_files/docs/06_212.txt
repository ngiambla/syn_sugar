 INTRODUCTION 
 
 1 In this proceeding the applicant ('Deangrove') has sought to establish that it suffered financial damage because, in effect, the respondents exercised their power of sale in respect of property of Deangrove without taking all reasonable care to sell that property for the best price then reasonably obtainable.
The property in question was constituted by units in a substantial residential development undertaken by Deangrove in Queensland.
The respondents had been appointed receiver and manager of Deangrove's property by the Commonwealth Bank of Australia ('the Bank') which had provided finance for that development.
2 For the reasons set out below I have concluded that Deangrove has not established either that:
 
 (a) the respondents failed to take all reasonable care to sell the property of Deangrove for the best price then reasonably obtainable or otherwise breached any duty owed by them to Deangrove (see [57]-[70] below); or (b) it suffered financial damage because of the way in which the respondents exercised their power of sale in respect of the property of Deangrove (see [71]-[86] below).

 FACTUAL BACKGROUND 
 
3 There is no real dispute between the parties as to the factual background to this proceeding.
4 Much of the evidence placed before the Court consisted of contemporaneous documents.
Additionally the applicant called evidence from two solicitors, Christopher James Lane ('Mr Lane') and James Nicholas Conomos ('Mr Conomos').
In the early months of 2000 Mr Lane worked as an in-house counsel for a group of companies that included Islands Hotels Limited ('Islands') and IHL Australia Pty Ltd ('IHL').
During the period from approximately late February 2000 to May 2000 Mr Conomos, a sole practitioner, was retained by Islands and IHL.
The respondents called evidence from the first respondent ('Mr Buckby').
Neither party called evidence from a director of either Islands or IHL.
Events Leading to the Appointment of the Respondents 
 
5 At all relevant times Deangrove was the registered proprietor of certain strata units within a development known as the 'Holloways Beach Resort' at Cairns in Queensland ('the Development').
The Development was sometimes referred to as the 'Cairns Beach Resort'.
The Bank advanced finance to Deangrove for the purpose of the Development.
To secure the advance made by the Bank to Deangrove the Bank held:
 
 (a) a registered first mortgage granted by Deangrove over the unsold units in the Development; and (b) an equitable charge over the assets and undertaking of Deangrove including the units in the Development.


6 In October 1999 the debt owed by Deangrove to the Bank was in the order of $7 million and the Bank was dissatisfied with the progress being made by Deangrove in selling the units.
The Bank contacted the respondents and foreshadowed their appointment as receiver and manager of the property of Deangrove pursuant to the Bank's securities.
7 As at 29 November 1999 Deangrove remained the registered proprietor of 65 of the 74 units contained within the Development.
On that day Deangrove entered into a Deed in respect of 50 of the units in the Development ('the Deed').
The other parties to the Deed were Islands, John Anthony Jeans ('Mr Jeans') and IHL.
Islands is a company incorporated in Papua New Guinea and listed on the Australian Stock Exchange ('ASX').
Mr Jeans at all relevant times held all of the issued share capital of Deangrove.
IHL is a subsidiary of Islands.
8 By the Deed Deangrove agreed to sell to IHL and IHL agreed to buy from Deangrove certain rights in respect of 50 units in the Development.
Those rights included the right to exclusive possession of the units, the right to act as the sole letting agent in respect of the units and the right to cause Deangrove to sell all or any of the units on terms and conditions determined by IHL --- provided that upon settlement of each unit the sum of $92 000 from the sale was paid to the Bank in exchange for a release of the mortgage in respect of that unit.
9 The parties to the Deed acknowledged that within each of the units in the Development there was a package of furniture and that Deangrove had contracted with the supplier of that furniture to make payments to the supplier on the settlement of each unit containing furniture.
IHL undertook to pay $12 000 to the furniture supplier from the sale proceeds of each unit.
10 By the Deed IHL agreed to indemnify Deangrove against its liabilities to the Bank under its registered first mortgage in respect of a principal amount of $4.6 million but with provision for that amount to be reduced should units be sold and mortgage repayments consequentially made.
The Deed also provided for IHL to cause to be allotted to Deangrove or its nominee 7 323 785 fully paid ordinary shares in Islands.
11 The term of the Deed was from 27 November 1999 to 30 November 2000 unless earlier terminated in accordance with the provisions of the Deed.
However, as the Deed recognised, the term of the Bank's mortgage ended on 30 April 2000.
12 It is agreed on the pleadings that on about 6 December 1999 Islands settled the purchase of the manager's unit in the Development leaving 49 units subject to the Deed.
It seems more likely that in fact this unit was purchased by IHL.
13 On or about 23 December 1999 7 323 785 fully paid shares in Islands were allotted to a nominee of Deangrove pursuant to the Deed.
The Bank did not consent to the shares being allocated to a party other than Deangrove.
14 On 6 January 2000 the respondents were appointed by the Bank jointly and severally as receiver and manager of the undertaking, property and assets of Deangrove pursuant to the terms of the Bank's securities.
As at 6 January 2000 the property of Deangrove included the 49 units that remained subject to the Deed and 15 other unsold units in the Development.
Events Between 6 January --- 30 April 2000 
 
15 The evidence reveals that Mr Buckby, whose place of business was closer to the Development than that of the second respondent ('Mr Dennis'), assumed a closer involvement in the day to day administration of the affairs of Deangrove than Mr Dennis.
16 By the time of closing submissions in this matter Deangrove's allegation that the respondents had breached their general law and statutory duties to Deangrove was limited to an attack on a single decision made by Mr Buckby with respect to the 49 units.
That decision was a decision, which was put into effect by a letter dated 5 May 2000, to reject an 'offer' made by IHL to purchase the 49 units.
For this reason, other conduct and decisions of the respondents in respect of the property of Deangrove need be considered only to the extent that they relate to the decision of 5 May 2000 to reject IHL's 'offer' for the 49 units.
17 Following the appointment of the respondents as receiver and manager Mr Buckby moved promptly to obtain a valuation of the units.
The valuation obtained by him in respect of the 49 units if sold 'in one line' was $3 million (ie an average of $61 244 per unit).
The amount that would have been payable by IHL to the Bank in reduction of Deangrove's indebtedness were IHL to exercise its right under the Deed to require Deangrove to sell a unit or units was $92 000 per unit.
18 Having regard to the valuation received by him, Mr Buckby recognised that it would be in the best interests of Deangrove for IHL to purchase the remaining 49 units pursuant to the Deed.
Nonetheless, he did not move immediately to adopt the Deed.
By a letter dated 12 January 2000, Islands stated its position as being that it expected both the Bank and the respondents to recognise the Deed.
It expressed concern that the appointment of the respondents as receiver and manager would impact adversely on the marketability of all units in the Development.
It appears that soon thereafter Islands sought legal advice with respect to its position under the Deed.
A meeting was held on 24 January 2000 between Mr Buckby, representatives of IHL and their respective legal advisers to discuss the Deed.
19 By a letter dated 27 January 2000 B M Culley  Associates Pty Ltd ('Culley') confirmed advice, apparently earlier given to Mr Buckby by telephone, that it had not been paid in full for the work undertaken by it as the builder of the Development.
It sought Mr Buckby's assistance to ensure prompt payment of the monies outstanding.
Shortly thereafter, by a facsimile transmission dated 3 February 2000 from Culley's solicitor, Culley expressed interest in acquiring 15 unspecified units in the Development for a sale price of $90 000 inclusive of furniture.
20 On the same day (ie 3 February 2000) McCullough Robertson, a firm of solicitors acting for Islands, sent a letter to the Bank asserting, amongst other things, that the appointment of the respondents had substantially reduced the market value of the 49 units the subject of the Deed.
The letter foreshadowed a claim pursuant to s 52 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) should the Bank not immediately 'remove the receiver' .
A copy of this letter was sent to the respondents' solicitor with the additional advice that:
 
 'Our client's instructions are that should your client attempt to take possession of the 49 units ... our client will immediately apply to the Supreme Court for the appropriate injunctive relief.
' 
 

21 Following correspondence and discussions between Mr Buckby, Culley and Culley's solicitor by which Culley revised its offer to acquire units in the Development, Culley ultimately submitted two written offers, each dated 28 February 2000, to purchase units in the Development using a related company.
One offer was for the 15 units not subject to the Deed.
The other was for the 49 units subject to the Deed.
In each case Culley agreed to pay $98 000 per unit exclusive of furniture with purchase of the furniture for $12 000 to be dealt with by separate contract.
A deposit of $4 500 per unit was offered in respect of each of the 15 units.
In the case of the 49 units an initial deposit of $1 000 per unit was offered plus a further $1 500 on settlement of the 15 units.
22 On 1 March 2000 the Bank instituted a proceeding in the Supreme Court of Queensland apparently seeking to obtain possession of the 49 units.
On the same day Mr Buckby advised the Bank in writing that he considered that Culley's offer for the 15 units should be accepted.
In respect of the offer to purchase the 49 units he pointed out that he had conducted his negotiations with Culley in his capacity as receiver and manager of Deangrove.
However, in the light of the legal proceeding instituted that day, he recommended that, in effect, he seek to maintain Culley's interest pending the outcome of that proceeding.
If the Bank obtained possession of the 49 units, the Bank, rather than the company in receivership, would be the vendor on their sale.
Also on 1 March 2000 Mr Buckby sought a valuation of the units from Taylor Byrne Valuers.
23 By letter dated 3 March 2000 Mr Buckby received advice that the Bank was prepared to discharge its mortgage over the 15 units under the respondents' control subject to the receipt of $98 000 per unit less normal settlement costs.
This letter also advised Mr Buckby that the Bank expected to gain possession of the 49 units on 9 March 2000 so that contracts for all 64 units could be exchanged on that afternoon.
24 I interpolate that a contract for sale of the 15 units dated 13 April 2000 was executed by Mr Buckby, in his capacity as receiver and manager of Deangrove, as vendor and by Valemed Pty Limited, a company apparently related to Culley, as purchaser.
The purchase price was $1.65 million and the deposit payable was $67 500.
Brian Malcolm Culley ('Mr Culley') guaranteed the due and punctual performance by the purchaser of its obligations under the contract.
25 The Bank's expectation with respect to the 49 units (see [23] above) was disappointed.
On 6 March 2000 Islands provided information to the ASX Company Announcements Office to the effect that it was strenuously defending the proceeding instituted by the Bank to recover possession of the 49 units and that it was considering other remedies available to it as a result of the actions of the Bank and Deangrove.
26 By a facsimile transmission dated 13 March 2000 sent to Charles Cole ('Mr Cole'), a director of IHL, Mr Conomos confirmed his instructions to file an application for injunctive relief to restrain the Bank and the respondents from disposing of the 49 units contrary to the Deed.
Mr Conomos advised:
 
 'The hearing on 24 March 2000 [presumably on the Bank's application for possession of the 49 units] will then turn into our application to stop the bank from selling the 49 units other than to you provided that you pay the $4.508 million to the bank by 30 April 2000 and continue to pay interest.

 
 ... 
 
 One matter of particular concern to me is that you will be giving, on behalf of the company, an undertaking as to damages ...
In other words, IHL must be in a position to settle on or before 30 April 2000 and that if it is not, then it is placing at risk the companies who are providing the undertakings as to damages.
Accordingly, if you are able to secure further financial support ... that would be advisable.
' 
 

27 On 14 March 2000 Mr Conomos wrote to the Bank's solicitors seeking confirmation that the Bank would 'honour its agreement with [IHL] to release its mortgages over the units the subject of [the Deed] for the sum of $4,508,000.00 ... on the basis that payment be made on or before 30 April 2000 with my client continuing to pay interest at 9% per annum on $4,508 million.
' The letter foreshadowed legal proceedings against the Bank unless the confirmation sought was received by close of business on that day.
28 On 24 March 2000 an order was made in the Supreme Court of Queensland in the proceeding instituted by the Bank.
By this order the Bank's application was adjourned to 3 May 2000 on the basis of undertakings given by each party.
When giving his client written advice of this order and its significance Mr Conomos stressed the need for IHL to be in a position to buy the units on or before 30 April 2000.
He indicated that, in his view, there was still an opportunity to negotiate with the Bank over price provided that it could be shown that the Bank's actions had reduced the value of the units.
29 As mentioned in [11] above, the term of the Bank's mortgage ended on 30 April 2000.
As 30 April 2000 was a Sunday, IHL saw the preceding Friday as the critical date.
On 19 April 2000 Mr Conomos sent a facsimile transmission to Mr Cole and Mr Lane in the following terms:
 
 'I confirm my advice that if the sum of $4,508,000.00 is not paid by close of business on Friday, 28 April 2000, the bank and Deangrove are within their rights immediately after close of business on that day (i.e.
at 5.01 p.m.) to sign a contract to sell the units to any other party including the party who has offered to buy the 64 units in the Cairns Beach Resort for $98,000.00 per unit.

 
 Also any claim for damages that we may have had against the bank arising from the appointment of the receiver would then have disappeared because we did not do what we had agreed to do.

 
 I CANNOT STRESS ENOUGH HOW IMPORTANT IT IS THAT WE PAY THE SUM OF $4,508,000.00 TO THE BANK IN EXCHANGE FOR A RELEASE OF THEIR MORTGAGES OVER THE 49 UNITS ON OR BEFORE CLOSE OF BUSINESS ON FRIDAY, 28 APRIL 2000.
' 
 

30 IHL did not pay the sum of $4.508 million, or any sum, to the Bank on 28 April 2000 in exchange for the release of its mortgage over the 49 units.
However, in a letter dated 28 April 2000 addressed to Mr Conomos, the respondents' solicitors referred to advice from Mr Conomos that his client wished to pay $1.7 million for the units immediately with the balance to be paid in 14 days.
The letter concluded:
 
 'We note that you have not to date put to us anything in writing in relation to a proposed Contract.
On presentation of a Contract and confirmation that your client is in a position to pay the $1.7 million, and when we receive clarification from you regarding purchase of the furniture packages, we will seek our client's instructions.
We note that we will also need to seek confirmation from the Commonwealth Bank of Australia that it is prepared to discharge Mortgages.

 
 We note that you advised you would forward to us a draft Contract for our client's consideration.
We look forward to receiving the same.
' 
 

31 By a letter dated 28 April 2000 addressed to the respondents' solicitors Mr Conomos acknowledged that the funding required to purchase the 49 units was not then available.
He enclosed a draft contract and sought advice as to the respondents' attitude to the contract and to completion of it 'within the next 14 days' .
He further sought confirmation that the Bank would release its mortgage over the 49 units in exchange for $92 000 per unit.
32 As at 30 April 2000 neither Culley nor Valemed had paid the deposit due under the contract for the sale of the 15 units.
Events After 30 April 2000 
 
33 It appears that 1 May 2000 was a public holiday in Queensland.
By a letter dated 2 May 2000 Mr Conomos sought the assistance of the respondents' solicitors in negotiating with the Bank for an extension of the mortgage for a further term from 30 April 2000 to 30 November 2000.
He advised as follows:
 
 '1.
I presently have the sum of $1 million in my trust account; 
 
 
 
 2.
The sum of $670,000.00 is being advanced by a Mr Teller which moneys should be available within 7 days; 
 
 
 
 
 
 3.
Approval of finance for the sum of $3 million has been obtained by my client's parent company, Island Hotels Limited, although it is not expected that the moneys will be available for about 14 days.
' 
 
 
 

34 On 3 May 2000 the Bank obtained an interlocutory order in the Supreme Court of Queensland in its proceeding against IHL.
That order restrained IHL until trial or earlier order from exercising or purporting to exercise any right to possess any of the 49 units.
That is, the Bank effectively gained possession of the 49 units on that day.
35 On 5 May 2000 Mr Conomos forwarded to IHL a draft proposed deed drawn between IHL and Mr Jeans concerning 'IHL's claim against Jeans that he breached the terms of [the Deed] ' .
36 The letter identified by Deangrove as critical to its claim in this matter (see [16] above) is dated 5 May 2000.
It was written by the respondents' solicitors to Mr Conomos pursuant to instructions given to them by Mr Buckby on 3 May 2000.
It is appropriate to set out its reference heading and content in full:
 
 
 ' RE: DEANGROVE PTY LTD (RECEIVER AND MANAGER APPOINTED) ACN 077 503 532 
 IHL AUSTRALIA PTY LTD  ANOR -V- COMMONWEALTH BANK OF AUSTRALIA  ANOR 
 
 
 
 We refer to our letter of 2 May 2000.
We note the orders made by the Court on Wednesday 3 May 2000.

 
 We have now received our client's instructions in respect to the offer made by your client.
We are instructed to advise you that our client has received an offer for the purchase of the 49 remaining units in the sum of $98,000.00 per unit exclusive of furniture.
Further, the offeror has offered a sum of $12,000.00 in respect to the furniture situated in each of those remaining units.
In this regard, we refer to paragraph 5 of the Affidavit of Peter Muirhead sworn on 23 March 2000.

 
 Consequently, your client's offer of $92,000.00 per unit inclusive of furniture is rejected.

 
 Our client will be pleased to consider any further offer that your client wishes to make in respect to the remaining units.
' 
 

37 The evidence does not suggest that Mr Conomos replied to the above letter.
IHL did not make any further offer in respect of the 49 units, or any units, in the Development.
38 On the same day that the letter referred to in [36] above was written (ie 5 May 2000) Mr Buckby spoke with an officer of Culley who apologised for the delay in settling on the 15 units and advised that settlement was now likely to be in the week commencing 15 May 2000.
Mr Buckby expressed concern that no deposit had been paid.
The information that no deposit had been paid apparently took the officer of Culley by surprise.
In response to an enquiry from him about the 49 units, Mr Buckby stressed that the 15 units would have to be settled before he would deal further with Culley concerning the 49 units.
39 A further draft of the proposed deed referred to in [35] above was forwarded to directors of IHL on 8 May 2000 following a telephone conversation between Mr Conomos and Mr Cole.
The recitals of the further draft refer, as the recitals of the first draft also did, to the Deed and to allegations that Deangrove and Mr Jeans breached warranties given in the Deed.
However, recital F of the further draft had not appeared in the earlier draft.
Recital F of the further draft asserts:
 
 'IHL decided not to proceed with the option available to it under the deed to acquire the 49 Lots at the Cairns Beach Resort as a result of the Commonwealth Bank's action in appointing receivers over Deangrove Pty Ltd, the changed market conditions in Cairns and the reduced valuation of the 49 units.
' 
 

40 A deed was executed by Islands, IHL, Mr Jeans and two other individuals apparently during May 2000.
The deed as executed includes, amongst other recitals, the following recitals:
 
 
 'G On or about 6 January 2000 the Bank appointed a Receiver and Manager to the [Development] .
As a consequence of that appointment IHL and Islands have elected not to exercise the rights granted to IHL and Islands under the Deed in respect of the [Development] .

 
 H The parties to the Deed contend that the said appointment was in breach of the Bank's obligations to the parties.

 
 I Jeans and Deangrove have commenced proceedings number N214 of 2000 in the Federal Court of Australia against the Bank claiming damages for matters more particularly set out therein ...' 
 
 

41 It is convenient to interpolate here that on 21 June 2000 Islands issued a further announcement to the ASX which, amongst other things, stated:
 
 'On 6 January 2000 the Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) appointed a receiver to the Cairns Beach Resort owned by Deangrove.
