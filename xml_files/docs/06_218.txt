 (MOTIONS FOR ORDERS FOR SECURITY FOR COSTS) 
 EDMONDS J: 
 
 INTRODUCTION 
 
1 By Notice of Motion dated 23 February 2005 and filed the following day, the first, second, third and fourth respondents moved the Court for orders that pursuant to s 1335 of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) and/or s 56 of the Federal Court Act 1976 (Cth), the first and second applicants provide, within seven days, security for costs to the first to fourth respondents in the amount of $240,000.00, or such other amount as the Court thinks fit.
2 By Notice of Motion filed 21 February 2005, the fifth, sixth and seventh respondents moved the Court for orders that the first and second applicants provide, within seven days, security for costs to the fifth to seventh respondents in the amount of $250,000.00, or such other amount as the Court thinks fit.
3 I heard both motions together, although I hasten to add that both sets of respondents eschewed any suggestion that their interests were conterminous such that the respective amounts of security should be assessed on common representation.
On the contrary, each strongly advocated that the Court should approach the matter on the basis that, owing to actual or potential conflicts between them, separate representation was necessary.
Indeed, on the second day of the hearing, I granted leave to the first to fourth respondents to file a cross-claim ('the Second Cross-Claim') against the fifth respondent.
BACKGROUND 
 Parties and Brief History 
 
4 The first applicant, ThoughtWeb Systems Pty Limited ('ThoughtWeb Systems'), is the owner of certain intellectual property rights --- copyright, patent and confidential information --- in relation to computer software that it has developed and marketed ('the Software') with the second applicant, ThoughtWeb Pty Limited ('ThoughtWeb'), (ThoughtWeb Systems and ThoughtWeb being hereinafter together called 'the ThoughtWeb Companies').
5 The first to third respondents, Anthony Mark Loughnan, David John McFarlane and Amit Sule (together 'the Employees'), were employees of ThoughtWeb Systems respectively from 1986, 1989 and 2001 until August 2004 and worked as software developers of the Software during that time.
6 Since late August 2004, the Employees have provided software consulting services to the fourth respondent, Dalsix Pty Limited ('Dalsix'), which in turn has provided those services to the fifth respondent, ThoughtWeb Financial Limited ('TWF').
TWF is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom that develops and markets software.
7 In July and September 2002, ThoughtWeb entered into three agreements with TWF, the ThoughtWeb Partner Licence Agreement ('the PLA'), the Marketing Partner Agreement ('the MPA') and the Industry Business Partner Addendum ('the IBPA') (collectively 'the Licence Agreements') pursuant to which, in general terms, TWF was licensed by ThoughtWeb to develop and distribute the Software within a defined industry and defined geographical locations.
8 On 20 August 2004, each of the Employees gave notice of termination of his employment with ThoughtWeb Systems, effective immediately and thereafter entered into employment agreements with Dalsix.
9 On 25 August 2004, TWF accepted an offer from Dalsix whereby each of the Employees would work for TWF utilising technology then licensed by ThoughtWeb to TWF.
10 On 8 December 2004, ThoughtWeb purported to terminate the Licence Agreements, thereby terminating TWF's entitlement to use the Software.
11 On the same date, the ThoughtWeb Companies commenced these proceedings.
At that time the only respondents were the Employees.
12 On 15 December 2004, TWF commenced proceedings in the Supreme Court of New South Wales against the ThoughtWeb Companies in which it sought, inter alia , a declaration that the purported termination by ThoughtWeb of the Licence Agreements was invalid and of no effect, and related interlocutory relief.
13 Various consent orders were made in both sets of proceedings on 20 December 2004, the practical affect of which was to have TWF and the sixth respondent, ThoughtWeb Limited ('TWL'), also incorporated in the United Kingdom, and a related company of TWF, joined as respondents in these proceedings and to have all the issues raised in both sets of proceedings determined in these proceedings.
The seventh respondent, John Skinner Wilson ('Wilson'), is a director of TWF and TWL.
14 TWF has filed a cross-claim ('the First Cross-Claim') against ThoughtWeb and two other companies, ThoughtWeb Inc and Assurex Escrow Pty Limited.
15 In the First Cross-Claim, TWF denies the validity of the purported termination of the Licence Agreements and contends that it was ineffective.
TWF is currently conducting itself as if it is still licensed to use the Software.
TWF also seeks rectification of a Software Escrow Agreement dated 10 February 2004 between TWF, ThoughtWeb Inc and Assurex Escrow Pty Limited.
16 Since the purported termination of the Licence Agreements, the Employees have continued to provide services to TWF through Dalsix which involve working on and with the Software.
17 The Employees and Dalsix maintain that they are working for TWF within the 'framework' of the arrangements represented by the Licence Agreements.
18 On 23 December 2004, ThoughtWeb and TWF consented to certain orders being made which, inter alia , provided for certain moneys to be paid into a jointly controlled account, subject to ThoughtWeb complying with an undertaking as a condition precedent to payment.
The Employees and Dalsix were not asked to, and did not, consent to that arrangement.
Claims made in the Substantive Proceedings 
 
19 By their Further Amended Application and Statement of Claim, filed on 11 February 2005, the ThoughtWeb Companies assert, inter alia , that by providing services to TWF, the Employees have breached the terms of their employment with ThoughtWeb Systems, equitable obligations of confidence and various statutory provisions.
The ThoughtWeb Companies seek against the Employees (and Dalsix) declaratory and injunctive relief as well as orders for damages/compensation and for delivery up of certain documents and materials.
