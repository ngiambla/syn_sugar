 INTRODUCTION 
 
 1 This is an application by Lactos Fresh Pty Ltd against Finishing Services Pty Ltd and Colliers International (Victoria) Pty Ltd.
It arises out of the events surrounding the first respondent's attempt to increase the rent of a customised food processing and storage facility at 22-24 Glenvale Crescent, Mulgrave ("the Mulgrave premises"), that it owns and leases to the applicant.
2 As against the first respondent, the applicant claims that the rental increase notice was invalid, that the first respondent breached an implied duty of good faith and fair dealing, and that the first respondent acted unconscionably, in breach of s 51AA of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth).
3 The second respondent provided certain information to the first respondent as to the market rate of rental that, in its opinion, was applicable to the Mulgrave premises.
This information, in the form of a letter from the second respondent to the first respondent ("the Colliers letter"), was incorporated in the rental increase notice as an attachment.
As against the second respondent, the applicant claims that it engaged in misleading or deceptive conduct under s 52 of the Trade Practices Act , causing loss or damage to the applicant.
The claim against the second respondent is, in effect, pleaded as an alternative to the primary claim against the first respondent, that the rental increase notice was invalid.
If the challenge to the validity of that notice succeeds, the applicant does not press any claim against the second respondent.
BACKGROUND 
 
4 The first respondent leased the Mulgrave premises to the applicant in 1999.
At that time, the applicant was called Nobi Holdings Pty Ltd. Prior to this, the Mulgrave premises had been leased by the first respondent to New Zealand Milk (Ausapac) Pty Ltd ("New Zealand Milk"), a company associated with the New Zealand Government.
5 The applicant's business involves the cutting and wrapping of cheese.
This process is conducted out of the Mulgrave premises.
The applicant's parent company is Lactos Pty Ltd.
It conducts research and development, marketing and operations activities, and is based in Burnie, Tasmania.
Lactos Pty Ltd's parent company is a French company called Bongrain SA.
Mr Claude Bertrand, a French national, is the General Manager of the applicant.
6 The first respondent owns a number of industrial properties, including the Mulgrave premises.
Its directors are John Allen, and his son Matthew.
All references in these reasons for judgment to Mr Allen are to Mr John Allen, unless otherwise indicated.
Mr Allen also is the principal of Allen  Allen solicitors who operate out of Finishing Services' premises in Moorabbin.
It appears that Allen  Allen only do work for companies associated with Mr Allen.
7 The lease for the Mulgrave premises is dated 1 September 1999, and is for a term of seven years, with the option of a further term ("the lease").
The annual rental at the time of the signing of the lease was $244,152.
8 Clause 3.2.2 of the lease provides for a "market rental review".
The clause is prolix, to say the least.
It relevantly provides as follows:
 
 "MARKET RENTAL REVIEW 
 
 Upon any day being not more than six months prior to 1 March 2003 and (if the Lessee exercises its option to renew) not more than 6 months prior to 1 September 2006 and 1 March 2010.
The Lessor or the Managing Agent may give written notice to the Lessee stating the sum which the Lessor assesses to be the proper rent for the premises for the ensuing period such rent being the market rental value for the premises on the assumption that the premises are tenanted and with all fixtures and fittings and partitions, plant machinery utensils shelving safes and other articles and materials as set out in schedule 2 installed by either the Lessor or the Lessee and having regard to the rents being obtained for comparable premises within the same municipality and the rent shall be varied accordingly, such variation to take effect on and from the day immediately following the date to which such notice shall relate and if the party receiving the notice does not object in writing to the proposed market rent within 30 days it becomes the rent for the review period PROVIDED that the Lessee may by notice in writing (delivered to the Lessor or the Managing Agent within 30 days following receipt of the Lessor's or the Managing Agent's notice of assessment) state that he disputes the Lessor's assessment in which case sub-clause (a) hereof will apply AND in all respects time shall be of the essence in the delivery of the said notice within the time so stipulated.
" (emphasis added)
 

9 Clause 3.2.2 goes on to provide a mechanism for determining the rent should the lessee dispute the lessor's assessment.
That mechanism involves having a member of the Australian Institute of Valuers determine the proper rent.
10 The clause, as set out above, is ungrammatical at various points.
For example, the first sentence is incomplete, and presumably ought to be linked to the second sentence with a comma.
It also gives rise to difficult questions of interpretation because of the imprecise manner in which it was drafted.
Nonetheless, it has been set out verbatim.
11 In practical terms, clause 3.2.2 provides that the lessor may serve written notice on the lessee specifying the lessor's assessment of the proper rent and, if the lessee does not object in writing within 30 days, the lessor's assessment will automatically become the new rent.
12 Schedule 2, to which clause 3.2.2 refers, is in the following terms:

13 Communications between the applicant and the first respondent in relation to an increase in rent commenced in late December 2002.
A letter dated 20 December 2002 was sent by Mr Allen, on behalf of the first respondent, to the applicant.
It bore the heading "Notice of Rental Assessment commencing 1 March 2003 for 42-44 Glenvale Crescent, Mulgrave".
The letter was sent to the Mulgrave premises, addressed to "The Manager, Nobi Holdings Pty Ltd".
It was received, and stamped as such, by the applicant on 23 December 2002.
The letter stated:
 
 "Under the terms of our lease a market review of the rent paid is to take effect from 1 March 2003.
Please find enclosed the Managing Agent's letter in this regard which is self explanatory and will form the basis of the new rent starting 1 March 2003.

 
 In due course we will correspond with you regarding the new monthly rental and the appropriate GST that will be payable.
" 
 

14 The "Managing Agent's letter" enclosed with the notice was a letter from Lynton Williams, an Associate at Colliers International (Victoria) Pty Limited (the second respondent), addressed to "John Allen, Finishing Services Pty Ltd" ("the Colliers letter").
It was dated 24 October 2002 and stated:
 
 "RE: 42 --- 44 GLENVALE CRESCENT, MULGRAVE 
 
 As your managing agent we draw your attention to the fact that a market value rental review is due in respect of this property on the 1 st of March 2003.

 
 We have investigated the current market rental levels for similar buildings that incorporate cool room and chiller facilities.
We report that in our opinion the market rates for the various areas are as follows: 
 
 Offices: 208 m2 x $155.00 p.sq.m.
$ 32.240.00 p.a.

 Coolroom, etc: 2,768 m2 x $135,00 p.sq.m $373,680.00 p.a.

 Warehouse 400 m2 x $ 75.00 p.sq.m.
$ 30,000.00 p.a.

 $435.920.00 p.a.

 
 Should you agree with the above we will notify the tenant accordingly.
" 
 

15 It was accepted by the applicant, and by the first respondent, that the rental increase notice is constituted by the letter from Mr Allen and the Colliers letter attached to that letter.
Together I will refer to them as "the notice".
16 A relevant issue is whether the parties had any oral communication in late December.
This goes to the applicant's claims in relation to good faith and unconscionable conduct, but also to the context in which the notice was served, and the factual matrix within which it should be construed.
Mr Bertrand originally claimed that he had a telephone conversation with Mr Allen on 23 December 2002 (a Monday).
Mr Allen denied absolutely that any such conversation had taken place on that date.
Indeed, he responded to Mr Bertrand's claim by pointing out that it was simply not possible for there to have been such a conversation on that date because the first respondent's factory and office had closed for the Christmas break on the afternoon of 20 December 2002.
Mr Bertrand then altered his position, and acknowledged that the conversation must have occurred on 20 December 2002, and not as he originally thought on 23 December 2002.
17 In any event, Mr Bertrand says that the purpose of the phone call was to arrange a meeting to discuss alterations to the Mulgrave premises.
He says that he and Mr Allen were unable to meet until 3 February 2003 because Mr Allen was unavailable over Christmas until 15 January, and Mr Bertrand was unavailable between 15 January 2003 and 30 January 2003.
Mr Bertrand says he believes that the conversation would have taken place before he had read the notice.
During that telephone conversation, Mr Bertrand says that no mention was made of the rental increase.
This claim by Mr Bertrand forms the core of the applicant's case on unconscionable conduct and good faith.
18 After receiving the notice, Mr Bertrand telephoned Mr Greg Finkemeyer.
Mr Finkemeyer was in charge of a Lactos facility that was rented in Dingley, Victoria, and in that role, had a relationship with Jones Lang LaSalle, a large commercial real estate agent.
Mr Bertrand asked Mr Finkemeyer to provide him with an indication of what the current market rent would be on the Mulgrave premises.
19 In response to this request, Mr Finkemeyer sent Mr Bertrand an email on 17 January 2003, but which was not received by Mr Bertrand until after he returned from leave on 31 January 2003.
Mr Finkemeyer stated:
 
 "I'm led to believe that the market price for Mulgrave is: 
 
 $120 per Square mt for Refrigerated/Plant space.

 $70 for office/dry store area.
" 
 

20 These figures would equate to an annual rental on the Mulgrave premises of $374,720, $61,200 less than the figure specified in Colliers letter.
Both figures are exclusive of GST.
21 The applicant provided the first respondent with a written response to the notice on 3 February 2003.
On that date, a meeting was held between the parties, primarily to discuss alterations that had taken place at the Mulgrave premises.
Mr Bertrand says the meeting was organised during the telephone conversation that he claims to have had with Mr Allen in late December.
Mr Allen says that the meeting was organised on 3 February 2003, after Mr Bertrand called him to inform him that the applicant had made alterations at the Mulgrave premises.
At the meeting, Mr Bertrand gave Mr Allen a letter which stated:
 
 "We acknowledge receipt of your letter with the assessment by your agent of the market value for the property we rent from you in Mulgrave.
The amount of the increase you are asking for is very detrimental to our business.
Therefore we have requested an estimation from our own agent.

 
 His assessment turns out to be significantly different from your agent estimation.
His opinion on office/dry warehouse cost is $ 70 p.sq.m.
and $ 120 p.sq.m.
for refrigerated space.

 
 We would like to understand how these two numbers coming from professional agents can be so different and resolve this matter with you in due course.
" 
 

22 Both Mr Allen and Mr Bertrand agree that Mr Bertrand commented that the increase in rent would have a detrimental impact on the applicant's business.
Mr Allen says that he said words to the effect that it was "too late to complain" about the rent increase now, although Mr Bertrand says he does not have any recollection of Mr Allen's reaction to the letter he handed him at the 3 February 2003 meeting.
23 Following the meeting, Mr Allen sent a letter under cover of Allen  Allen letterhead, dated 20 February 2003, to Lactos Fresh Pty Ltd c/o Lactos Pty Ltd in Burnie.
It was marked to the attention of Alan Jarman, the company secretary of Lactos Fresh Pty Ltd. Mr Jarman was the person with whom Mr Allen usually corresponded in relation to matters involving the lease of the Mulgrave premises.
It relevantly stated:
 
 "Re: Lease from Finishing Services Pty Ltd 
 Premises: 42-44 Glenvale Crescent, Mulgrave 
 
 Please advise your bank to alter the telegraphic transfer commencing on 1 March 2003 in relation to the new rental for the current year at $39,959.33 per month of which $3,632.67 is the GST component.
" 
 

24 The applicant submitted that it was of some relevance that Mr Allen had addressed the notice to the Mulgrave premises, rather than to Mr Jarman, which it contended would have been the usual course.
On the other hand, the lease itself provided for the service of a rent review notice at the demised premises, as well as the registered office of the lessee.
25 Mr Bertrand then sent a letter to Mr Allen, dated 7 March 2003.
After outlining some of the previous communications between the applicant and first respondent, it stated, amongst other things:
 
 "It is clear then that we do not have agreement as to the market rent for the premises and as such the provisions of clause 3.2.2(a) of the Lease are now operative.

 
 We confirm our previous advices that we dispute that you have provided a proposed increase that is at market.
We also note that you are estopped from relying on the time period set out in clause 3.2.2 due to your unavailability to meet during the relevant period.
" 
 

26 Mr Allen responded to this letter on 12 March 2003.
He stated that "[n]o written objection as required by clause 3.2.2 of the Lease was received during the 30 day period" and "[y]ou are therefore unable to dispute the rental as advised in our correspondence of 20 December 2002".
Mr Allen indicated that Lactos Fresh Pty Ltd would be in breach of the lease if it did not pay the increased rental.
27 On 17 March 2003, a meeting was held between Mr Bertrand and Mr Allen, at which the increase in rent was discussed.
Matthew Allen and Wayne Kelly, the plant manager for Lactos Fresh Pty Ltd, also attended the meeting.
Mr Bertrand offered to pay the increased rent up to a figure that it had been advised reflected market value (namely, the figure obtained by Mr Finkemeyer).
Mr Allen told Mr Bertrand that it was too late to object to the increase in rent.
Mr Bertrand stated that Mr Allen should have told him about the 30 day deadline.
Mr Allen rejected this suggestion.
28 Mr Bertrand deposes to a discussion at the 17 March 2003 meeting about the alleged conversation in late December, and the fact that the parties had not been able to meet all through January.
Mr Allen flatly denies that any such discussion took place during the course of the 17 March 2003 meeting.
Both parties agree that the meeting ended with the parties deciding that the applicant should consider its position.
29 On 20 March 2003, Mr Bertrand sent a letter to Mr Allen stating "we confirm our position as set out in our letter to you of 7 March 2003".
Mr Bertrand then stated:
 
 "Today, we have made an additional payment of $ 9,116.00.
As such, we have now commenced paying rent at the amount set out in our letter to you of February 3, 2003.
This increased payment is being made as a sign of good faith.
It is, however, an interim measure pending the assessment of the correct amount.

 
 As such, we repeat our request that you implement the provisions of clause 3.2.2(a) of the Lease and request the Australian Institute of Valuers to nominate a member to determine the current fair market rent.
" 
 

30 Mr Allen responded to this letter on 31 March 2003, stating, amongst other things:
 
 "It would appear that you totally ignored our correspondence of 12 March 2003 which was faxed to you and the original posted to you (a further copy is now enclosed).

 
 As you can see from that letter we rely on the written Lease between our respective companies as one does when a dispute arises.
As you will note we rely on the Managing Agent's, Colliers International assessment of what the new rental should be --- you verbally told the writer that you were relying on a valuation from Jones Lang LaSalle and that was the basis of your letter of 3 February 2003.

 
 Now in your correspondence of 20 March 2003 (even though you have adopted the new rent that you say should be payable by paying the balance into our bank account, pursuant to a Valuation from Jones Lang LaSalle) you are now out in the marketplace obtaining another assessment and I guess if that is not to your liking, you will then obtain another assessment and so on, until one is found that suits your company's needs.

 
 Mr Bertrand, be advised that all this is what we say in the English language as "academic", that means that obtaining one assessment after another is a complete waste of your time and your company's money.

 
 The new rent has been fixed according to the Lease.
Please have your company pay it without further procrastination which will stop further meetings and letter writing as my patience has nearly expired.
" 
 

31 Mr Bertrand responded to this letter the following day.
He stated "[f]or the record, please note that we do not accept the matters put forward by you".
Mr Bertrand then stated that Lactos Fresh Pty Ltd would make the rental payments set out in the notice, back paid to 1 March 2003.
Mr Bertrand asserted that:
 
 "[w]e are paying these amounts under protest.
We shall now proceed to have an independent valuation obtained as set out in the lease between us.
" 
 

32 Mr Bertrand also stated that a valuation had been requested by the applicant from Jones Lang LaSalle, however Jones Lang LaSalle had been unable to provide a valuation as they had previously done work for the first respondent.
33 Since 1 April 2003, the applicant has paid the increased rental, under protest.
It commenced proceedings in this Court on 17 December 2003.
