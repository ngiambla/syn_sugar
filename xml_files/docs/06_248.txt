That proceeding began as an ex-parte application, filed by Paul Burness as liquidator of Richmond Sales Pty Ltd ("Richmond Sales"), for a warrant under s 530C of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth).
The procedural history of that matter is outlined in reasons for judgment delivered on 8 February 2006: see Richmond Sales Pty Ltd (In Liq) v McDermott [2006] FCA 52 at [2] - [19] .
2 It is unnecessary to review all of the procedural history of the earlier proceeding involving these parties.
