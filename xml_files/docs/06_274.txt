1 This proceeding raises questions as to the meaning of the phrase ' substantial interest ' as used in Chapter 6 of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) ('the Act'), as well as questions concerning the exercise of powers by the Takeovers Panel under Division 2 of Part 6.10 of the Act.
The questions are raised in a proceeding brought under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 (Cth) ('the Judicial Review Act') and s 39B of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth) ('the Judiciary Act ') seeking judicial review of decisions of the Takeovers Panel.
It is not disputed by any of the respondents that the Court has jurisdiction to grant the relief claimed by the applicants.
2 The Takeovers Panel was established under s 171 of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 1989 (Cth) and continued in existence under the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001 (Cth), as described in Schedule 3 to the Financial Services Reform Act 2001 (Cth) ('the Panel').
The proceeding should be understood in the context of the Court's orders of 14 September 2005, made in Glencore International AG  Anor v Takeovers Panel  Ors [2005] FCA 1290.
3 The questions in the proceeding depend upon the effect of certain transactions described as ' cash settled equity swaps '.
A cash settled equity swap is an arrangement between an investor and a bank whereby the bank agrees to pay the investor an amount equal to the difference between the value of a given number of equity securities at the time of the closing out of the swap and the value of those equity securities at the time when the arrangement was entered into.
Under such an arrangement the investor does not acquire any interest in any equity securities and the investor has no right to call for delivery of equity securities or to require the bank to undertake any action involving the acquisition, holding or disposal of equity securities.
Closing out of, and settlement under, such a swap will, depending on the terms of the arrangement, be either at the option of one party or be automatic.
Of course, it would always be open to the parties to close out a swap by mutual agreement at any time.
In order to hedge its risk under such an arrangement, a bank might buy the relevant equity securities.
BACKGROUND 
 
4 The fourth respondent, Austral Coal Limited ('the Company'), is a miner of coking coal in southern New South Wales.
It sells coking coal both domestically and internationally.
The second respondent, Centennial Coal Company Limited ('Centennial'), is also a miner and marketer of coal.
At relevant times, shares in the Company and Centennial were listed for quotation on Australian Stock Exchange Limited ('ASX').
5 On 23 February 2005, Centennial and the Company jointly announced a takeover bid by Centennial for the Company on the basis of 10 shares in Centennial for every 37 shares in the Company.
At that time, there were 263,463,465 issued shares in the Company, together with 40 million convertible notes.
The consideration offered by Centennial effectively valued shares in the Company at $1.30 per share, although that value would vary with the market price of shares in Centennial.
The bid was subject to a number of conditions, including acceptances being received in respect of 90% of the issued shares in the Company.
The bid was unanimously recommended by the directors of the Company.
On 23 February 2005, the Company also announced that its convertible notes could be converted into ordinary shares once Centennial's offers became unconditional.
6 On 4 March 2005, Centennial announced that, on 2 March 2005, it had become a substantial holder in the Company with a relevant interest in 9.6% of the Company's shares.
On 9 March 2005, Centennial served on the Company its bidders statement under s 636 of the Act.
On 21 March 2005, the Company lodged its target's statement under s 638 of the Act, recommending acceptance of Centennial's bid.
Centennial's offers and the Company's target's statement were dispatched to the Company's shareholders between 21 and 23 March 2005.
7 On 23 March 2005, Centennial declared its bid unconditional and announced that, if a shareholder of the Company accepted no later than 7 April 2005, the shareholder would participate in a Centennial unfranked dividend of 6 cents per Centennial share.
The value of the unfranked dividend was approximately 1.6 cents per share in the Company.
8 As at 23 March 2005, Centennial's voting power in the Company was 16.5 per cent.
Thereafter, Centennial continued to acquire shares in the Company pursuant to acceptances of its bid.
It announced on 4 April 2005 that it had acquired 30 per cent, on 7 April 2005 50 per cent, on 8 April 2005 66.7 per cent and on 24 April 2005 82.4 per cent.
9 The first applicant, Glencore International AG ('Glencore'), is an international supplier of commodities and raw materials and is also an investor.
The second applicant, Fornax Investments Limited ('Fornax'), is a wholly owned subsidiary of Glencore.
As at 18 March 2005, Glencore and Fornax together held 4.88 per cent of the issued shares in the Company.
On 24 March 2005, Glencore acquired further shares in the Company taking its total holding to 4.99 per cent of the shares in the Company.
10 The questions in issue in the proceeding arise out cash settled equity swaps entered into by Glencore with the fifth respondent, Credit Suisse First Boston International ('CSFB') and the sixth respondent, ABN Amro Bank NV ('ABN Amro'), between 18 March 2005 and 4 April 2005 ('the Non-disclosure Period').
During the Non-disclosure Period, CSFB and ABN Amro (together 'the Banks') acquired shares in the Company as a hedge against their respective potential exposures under the swaps.
11 On 20 March 2005, Glencore and CSFB signed a non-binding summary of indicative terms and conditions in relation to a proposed cash settled equity swap agreement.
In the early stages of discussing the CSFB swap, Glencore and CSFB discussed a proposal for Glencore to cross its physical holding of shares in the Company to CSFB.
Ultimately, CSFB decided not to proceed with such a crossing.
Between 21 and 30 March 2005, CSFB acquired 12,100,060 shares in the Company in order to hedge its potential exposure under the equity swap agreement.
On 4 April 2005, CSFB and Glencore entered into a binding equity swap arrangement by reference to shares in the Company.
That arrangement was to expire in March 2008.
12 On 30 March 2005, ABN Amro provided a draft swap agreement to Glencore in respect of a proposed cash settled equity swap agreement.
Between 31 March and 4 April 2005, ABN Amro acquired 7,407,302 shares in the Company in order to hedge its potential exposure under that proposed equity swap agreement.
On 4 April 2005, Glencore and ABN Amro entered into a binding equity swap arrangement by reference to shares in the Company.
That arrangement was to expire in March 2006.
13 On most trading days, while CSFB was arranging swap exposure, CSFB advised Glencore of the swap exposure that had been arranged (number of reference shares and initial price) and Glencore approved the swap exposure proposed to be arranged on the following trading day.
The value of the swap exposure that CSFB provided to Glencore from time to time was never greater than the size of CSFB's physical holding in the Company, as CSFB acquired hedge shares up to the proposed value of the swap.
CSFB and Glencore executed confirmation of the swap on 4 and 6 April 2005 respectively.
The value of the swap and the initial price corresponded with the number of shares CSFB had actually acquired, the amount CSFB had paid for them and the average price per share, grossed up for commissions, taxes and other charges.
The confirmation also contained terms designed to exclude any implication that Glencore had power over voting or disposal of any shares held by CSFB.
14 The amount of swap exposure that ABN Amro agreed to provide at any time was never more than the number of shares in the Company that it had acquired down to that time.
Each trading day, Glencore approved the swap exposure that ABN Amro agreed to provide on the following day.
The ABN Amro swap, as confirmed on 4 April 2005, related to the precise number of shares acquired by ABN Amro, the amount ABN Amro had paid for them and the average price per share, grossed up for commissions, taxes and other charges.
15 As at 21 March 2005, the combined holding of shares in the Company by Fornax and CSFB was 5.13 per cent.
As at 23 March 2005, the combined holding of shares in the Company by Fornax and CSFB was 8.18 per cent and, as at 29 March 2005, the combined holding was 9.4 per cent.
By 4 April 2005, Glencore had acquired 13,715,443 shares in the Company.
By reason of the exercise of convertible notes issued by the Company, the number of issued shares in the Company had increased such that, as at 4 April 2005, Glencore held 4.56 per cent of the issued shares of the Company, CSFB's shares represented 4.03 per cent and ABN Amro's shares represented 2.46 per cent.
As at 4 April 2005, the combined holding of shares in the Company of Glencore, CSFB and ABN Amro was 33,222,745 shares, representing 11.05 per cent of the issued shares of the Company.
16 No announcement of any acquisition of shares in the Company by Glencore and Fornax or of the existence of the swaps was made before 4 April 2005.
It has not been suggested in this proceeding that the failure to do so constituted a contravention of the Act.
However, on the evening of 4 April 2005, Glencore made the following public announcement to the media, which was repeated to ASX at 9.30 am on the following day, 5 April 2005:
 
 'Glencore... announces that, through a wholly owned subsidiary, it has acquired approximately 5 per cent of the ordinary shares in [the Company].
These shares have been acquired over recent weeks, with the last parcel of shares acquired having been acquired by Glencore today.
A substantial shareholder notice would be filed with [the Company] and the ASX within the period prescribed under the Corporations Act .

 
 In addition, Glencore announces that it has entered into a number of cash settled equity swap agreements with well regarded investment banks.
Glencore has no legal obligation to disclose these swap arrangements but it does so to assist the market.
In aggregate, these swaps relate to approximately 7.4 per cent of the ordinary shares in [the Company] .
' 
 

17 Glencore lodged substantial holding notices in relation to its relevant interests in the shares in the Company on 6 and 19 April 2005.
In the first, Glencore disclosed that it had acquired 6.42 per cent of the Company through on market acquisitions between 9 March and 5 April 2005.
In the subsequent substantial shareholder notice, Glencore disclosed that its relevant interest had increased to 7.42 per cent through additional on market acquisitions.
Both notifications were accompanied by statements that Glencore had entered into cash settled equity swap agreements with well regarded investment banks in respect of 6.49 per cent of the Company's shares.
However, it has not been suggested in this proceeding that it was obliged to disclose the swaps in those notices.
PRIOR PROCEEDINGS 
 
18 On 3 June 2005, Centennial made an application to the Takeovers Panel under s 657C of the Act for a declaration of unacceptable circumstances in relation to Glencore's holding of shares in the Company and the CSFB and ABN Amro equity swaps.
The Takeovers Panel made a declaration of unacceptable circumstances on 28 June 2005 and made orders under s 657D of the Act.
19 On 1 July 2005, Glencore applied for a review of that declaration and those orders, pursuant to s 657EA of the Act.
On 20 July 2005, the Takeover Panel made another declaration that Glencore's non-disclosure until 4 and 5 April 2005 of the total of the shares in the Company acquired by Glencore and the swap exposure under the CSFB and the ABN Amro equity swaps, inter alia , amounted to unacceptable circumstances within the meaning of s 657A of the Act.
The Panel made orders on 25 July 2005 requiring Glencore to offer to sell Company shares to each person who sold Company shares in a transaction reported to ASX during the Non-disclosure Period.
