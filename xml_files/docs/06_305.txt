 INTRODUCTION 
 
 1 There are two proceedings before the Court which, though separate, raise related issues.
With the consent of the parties, these two proceedings have been heard together.
By agreement, evidence in one is taken to be evidence in the other.
2 VID 439 of 2003 ("the Pharmacia Proceeding") concerns the scope of the final injunction to be granted and, in particular, its duration, in a matter that was heard by Crennan J: Pharmacia Italia SpA v Mayne Pharma Pty Ltd (2005) 222 ALR 552 ("the Pharmacia Infringement Proceeding").
Her Honour found that Mayne Pharma Pty Ltd and the Faulding Co respondents ("Mayne") had infringed Pharmacia Italia SpA's ("Pharmacia") patent, Australian patent no.
598197 ("the Patent").
The injunction that she granted on 8 September 2005 restrains Mayne from infringing certain claims of the Patent until 19 June 2006, the end of the original term of the Patent, or until "such later date as the Court may hereafter order".
Mayne objects to any further order being made that would extend the term of that injunction, namely to cover the period of the Patent's extension from 19 June 2006 to 19 June 2011.
3 In the second proceeding before the Court, VID 1274 of 2005 ("the Interpharma Review Proceeding"), Interpharma Pty Ltd ("Interpharma") challenges the decisions of the Commissioner of Patents ("the Commissioner") to:
 
 
 (a) accept an application for an extension of the term of the Patent;
 (b) fail to refuse to accept an application for an extension of the term of the Patent; and
 (c) to grant an extension of the term of the Patent.

 

4 It does so pursuant to s 5 of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 (Cth) ("the ADJR Act ") and s 39B(1) of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth) ("the Judiciary Act ").
Interpharma has also applied to the Court for rectification of the Register of Patents pursuant to s 192 of the Patents Act 1990 (Cth) ("the Patents Act ").
The basis of that claim is that the Register erroneously records the Patent as having been extended to 19 June 2011.
5 In addition to the substantive matters raised by the application for judicial review, there is an issue regarding Interpharma's delay in having commenced that proceeding.
6 The Pharmacia Infringement Proceeding raises the issue of what rights a patentee has during the term of an extension, pursuant to s 78(1)(b)(i) of the Patents Act , and therefore what timeframe the final injunction in that proceeding should have.
The Interpharma Review Proceeding raises the issue of whether the decisions leading up to, and including, the decision to grant an extension, were lawfully made under s 70(2)(a) of the Patents Act .
7 Both these issues are to be resolved by answering the same question: is claim 1 of the claims of the Patent correctly characterised as a "pharmaceutical substance per se "?
Or does claim 1 involve elements of process or method that take it outside the scope of that expression?
8 The answer to this question will determine whether Mayne's plans regarding its own product, a competitor to that of Pharmacia, can go forward.
It will also affect Interpharma's planning in relation to the products that it intends to market.
