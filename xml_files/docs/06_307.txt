 
 1 The applicant appeals from a decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal constituted by the Honourable C R Wright QC, Deputy President, which affirmed a decision of a delegate of the Minister to cancel the applicant's visa under s 501(2) of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) (the Act): Evans v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] AATA 1051.
It was not in dispute that the applicant failed to pass the "character test" because he had a "substantial criminal record": s 501(6)(a) ,(7)(c).
The Minister nevertheless had a discretion to refuse to cancel the visa and the delegate was subject to ministerial directions under s 499.

 Applicant's conviction 
 
 2 On 3 December 2003 the applicant was convicted by a jury in the Supreme Court of Tasmania of attempting to murder his wife Ann Flowers.
He was sentenced to imprisonment for a period of four and a half years with parol eligibility after two years three months.
3 At the trial Mrs Flowers gave evidence that on the evening of 9 May 2003 she returned to the matrimonial home at about 7.55 pm and found her husband waiting inside.
He appeared to have been drinking heavily.
She went to the bedroom and lay on the bed reading a magazine.
Shortly afterwards the applicant entered, picked up a loaded gun which was kept in the bedroom, and said to her
 "I've been waiting all day for you --- you bitch --- you are going to die you bitch.
" 
 
 4 He pointed the gun at her and kept repeating "You're going to die".
He discharged the gun, shooting her in the stomach.
She attempted to wrest the gun from him.
He said he intended to "blow her brains out" and then to "blow his own brains out".
She managed to get hold of the gun.
He followed her from the bedroom and then returned saying "I'll get the other gun and finish what I started".
She escaped from the house.
She underwent surgery and eventually recovered.
5 The applicant's case at the trial was that he followed his wife to the bedroom for the purpose of killing himself in her presence.
He said he had no intention to harm her.
He denied threatening her in the manner alleged.
He said that his wife tried to take the gun from him and was shot accidentally in the ensuing struggle.
6 In the context of decisions under s 501 it was not open to the applicant to challenge his conviction or the essential facts giving rise thereto: Luu v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [1998] FCA 1021 , Bridges v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2001] FCAFC 1647.

 Dr Sale's Report 
 
 7 Prior to the trial Dr Ian Sale FRANZCP provided a report dated 31 October 2003 to the Legal Aid Commission of Tasmania.
The purpose of the report was to advise of the possibility of an insanity defence for the applicant under s 16 of the Criminal Code 1924 (Tas).
8 Dr Sale noted that the applicant, who was born in 1942, had a "number of significant health problems".
