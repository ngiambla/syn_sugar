 
1 The appellant, from Bangladesh, lodged an application for a protection visa on 16 October 1997.
A delegate of the first respondent refused to grant a protection visa ('the first delegate's decision').
The visa application before the first delegate referred to "my statutory declaration" but did not contain any such statutory declaration or any information relating to the appellant's claims for protection.
2 The appellant then lodged an application to the Refugee Review Tribunal ('the Tribunal') for review of the first delegate's decision on 21 November 1997 ('the first Tribunal application').
On 6 October 1999, the Tribunal ('the first Tribunal') wrote to the appellant informing him that it was not prepared to make a decision on the information that it had.
It invited him to a hearing and invited him, inter alia, to submit any new documents or written arguments.
On 9 November 1999, the appellant submitted a statutory declaration made on 9 November 1999 and other material to the first Tribunal.
The appellant attended the hearing before the first Tribunal.
On 7 December 1999, the Tribunal upheld the first delegate's decision ('the first Tribunal decision').
One of its findings was that it was not satisfied that the appellant ' has ever been an active politically-savvy member of any political party, not the BNP nor any other '.
I refer to the first Tribunal's findings in order to understand the findings the subject of this appeal.
3 On 3 July 2001 the appellant lodged a second application for a protection visa on the basis that the first application was invalid.
The second application included a copy of the statutory declaration that had earlier been forwarded to the first Tribunal.
The second application also included the statement: ' I trust all my supporting documents which I have provided the RRT is now available to the Onshore Refugee.
However if the department wants them again to forward I will do so as soon as I am advised '.
On 31 August 2001 a delegate of the first respondent refused to grant a protection visa to the appellant ('the second delegate's decision').
4 On 18 September 2001 the appellant applied to the Tribunal ('the second Tribunal') for a review of the second delegate's decision.
On 15 April 2002 the second Tribunal affirmed the second delegate's decision ('the second Tribunal decision').
THE SECOND TRIBUNAL DECISION 
 
5 The second Tribunal held that, pursuant to s 416 of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) ('the Act'), it was not required to consider any information considered in the earlier application for review.
It held that it may have regard to, and take to be correct, any decision that the first Tribunal made about or because of that information, and did so.
The second Tribunal accepted the findings of the first Tribunal ' that the [appellant] had not been a politically active member of any political party, not the BNP or any other, and that the [first] Tribunal was not satisfied that the [appellant] had a well founded fear of persecution in the foreseeable future if he returned to Bangladesh '.
6 The second Tribunal continued to consider the situation, in the alternative, if it were to accept the appellant's claims of political activism.
The second Tribunal noted that the appellant's claimed political party, the BNP, had been elected to government in Bangladesh and determined that the appellant could safely return to his country.
The second Tribunal also found that, if it accepted the appellant's claim that he faced false politically motivated charges on his return, he nevertheless would be able to access adequate state protection and that there would be no real chance of treatment amounting to persecution.
The second Tribunal also rejected the appellant's claim that he could not return to Bangladesh because his mother was contemplating moving to Sweden and there would be no one to protect him.
Even if this was accepted as factually correct, the Tribunal said that such a claim was not Convention based.
7 On 29 July 2004 the appellant lodged an application in the Federal Magistrates Court to review the second Tribunal decision.
On 29 April 2005, the Federal Magistrate dismissed the application.
THE DECISION OF THE FEDERAL MAGISTRATE 
 
8 The appellant was represented before the Federal Magistrate by Mr Julian Gormly of counsel.
