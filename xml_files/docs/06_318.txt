THE PROCEEDINGS 
 
1 In these proceedings, five members of a 'compensation claim group' seek a determination of compensation on behalf of members of the group, pursuant to s 61(1) of the Native Title Act 1993 (Cth) (' NTA ').
The determination is sought in respect of a block of 104 square kilometres (10,400 hectares), which was constituted as the Town of Yulara in the Northern Territory by a proclamation made on 29 July 1976 and published in the Gazette on 10 August 1976 (the 'Application Area').
The members of the compensation claim group are almost exclusively Yankunytjatjara or Pitjantjatjara people who, according to the applicants, held native title rights and interests in the Application Area and are entitled to compensation by reason of the extinguishment of those rights and interests.
2 The proceedings were commenced on 12 June 1997 by six applicants, one of whom has since died.
The applicants concede that one of the five remaining applicants, Mantatjara Wilson, does not satisfy the criteria for holding native title rights in the Application Area.
3 The Application Area incorporates the Yulara Tourist Village, which provides accommodation and other services for the tens of thousands of tourists who visit Ayres Rock (Uluru) and the Olgas (Kata Tjurta).
(The spelling of Kata Tjurta varies; I have adopted this form rather than Kata Tjuta, except where the latter is used in a name, such as the Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park.
) The Application Area also incorporates Connellan Airport, which is the point of arrival for tourists travelling by air to visit the area.
4 The Application Area is located in the far south of the Northern Territory, just north of the South Australian border.
It is in the eastern part of a large area generally described as the Western Desert, which encompasses northern parts of South Australia, southern parts of the Northern Territory and eastern parts of Western Australia.
5 Because the Application Area is 'land in a town' it has not been available for a claim under the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976 (Cth) (' Land Rights Act '): see s 50(1)(a) and the definition of 'unalienated Crown land' in s 3(1).
The Application Area is bounded on three sides by land held by the Katiti Aboriginal Land Trust, pursuant to a grant made under the Land Rights Act .
On the south, it abuts the Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park, which includes within its boundaries Uluru and Kata Tjurta.
The location of the Application Area is shown on Map 1 by reference to Uluru and Kata Tjurta.
The precise co-ordinates are recorded in the proclamation constituting the Town of Yulara.
Map 2 is a Tenure Map which shows, among other things, the current location of the Yulara Tourist Village, the Lasseter Highway and Connellan Airport (Lot 101) within the Application Area, together with lot numbers.
6 No native title determination has been made in relation to the whole or any part of the Application Area.
There is no dispute that all native rights and interests that otherwise might have existed over the Application Area have been extinguished, although the parties disagree as to whether any native title rights and interests existed at the relevant times and, if they did, precisely when and how the extinguishment took place.
It is agreed, however, that the acts extinguishing native title were, in the language of the NTA , 'acts attributable' to the Northern Territory.
The applicants seek compensation from the Northern Territory in respect of the acts extinguishing native title rights and interests over the Application Area (the 'compensation acts').
They do so on behalf of holders of native title rights and interests who were alive when the various compensation acts took place.
7 The applicants accept that native title rights and interests over the Application Area were extinguished as the result of the compensation acts, which took place from 1979 to 1992.
These acts included grants of freehold and leasehold estates over parts of the Application Area and the construction of public works on the Application Area, notably Connellan Airport, certain roads and a series of water bores.
On the applicants' case, native title rights and interests were not necessarily extinguished by the compensation acts themselves when they were done, but in consequence of the provisions of the NTA and of the Validation (Native Title) Act (NT) (' Validation Act ').
(The latter comprises the Validation of Titles and Actions Act 1994 (NT), as subsequently amended, and was enacted by the Legislative Assembly of the Northern Territory under the authority of the NTA .
) The applicants say that until the statutory extinguishment, the members of the compensation claim group held native title rights and interests over the Application Area under the traditional laws and customs of the Western Desert bloc observed and acknowledged by them.
They contend say that members of the compensation claim group are entitled to compensation under the NTA in respect of the extinguishment of their native title rights and interests.
The applicants characterise the claim as a group claim, the group comprising those who are able to establish that they held native title rights and interests immediately prior to the extinguishment of those rights and interests by the compensation acts.
8 The cornerstone of the applicants' case is that they and their predecessors held native title rights and interests over the Application Area under the traditional laws and customs of the Western Desert bloc, from before the time the Crown asserted sovereignty until the time the compensation acts extinguished native title.
It is common ground that the only acts prior to 1979 that could have extinguished any subsisting native title rights and interests over the Application Area were two pastoral leases granted over the land, respectively, in 1882 and 1896.
The applicants accept that the leases (both of which were determined after a short period) extinguished the most extensive of the native title rights and interests which survived the acquisition of sovereignty over the area by the Crown in 1824 or 1825.
They contend, however, that the pastoral leases left most native rights and interests unaffected.
9 It is no part of the applicants' case that the claimants themselves are a cohesive or discrete community.
They rely on the traditional laws and customs of the Western Desert bloc to which they say they adhere.
They contend that the people of the Western Desert can be regarded as a society with traditional laws and customs that have remained intact and have been observed since sovereignty.
The applicants say that those traditional laws and customs apply to the people of the eastern Western Desert, of which the Application Area forms part.
10 The evidence adduced by the applicants did not appear to be directed at establishing the existence of native title rights and interests at any particular date.
For the most part, the evidence did not distinguish between the position at the date of the trial and the position at any particular earlier date.
In final submissions, it became clear that the applicants' preferred position is that, generally speaking, the native title rights and interests over the Application Area were extinguished on 10 March 1994, the date the Validation Act came into force, and that, accordingly, the claim group's right to compensation accrued on that date.
One consequence of selecting this date is that, if the applicants' arguments are accepted, members of the compensation claim group are entitled to compensation for the improvements erected on the Application Area before 1994.
These improvements presumably include Connellan Airport, the construction of which was completed in 1981.
11 Later in this judgment I explain the compensation regime established by the NTA .
It is enough at this stage to note that the Court has jurisdiction to determine a compensation application: NTA , ss 50(2), 61(1), 81, 213(2).
12 The applicants seek compensation from the Northern Territory, the first respondent to the proceedings ('the Territory') (see NTA , s 84(4)).
They do not seek relief against the third respondent ('the Commonwealth').
However, it appears that the Commonwealth has a practical interest in the proceedings, because it has agreed to provide financial assistance to the Territory to enable it to satisfy any liability to pay compensation for acts affecting native title: see NTA, s 200(1).
In any event, the Commonwealth has been a party to the proceedings and has played an active role throughout, without objection from the applicants.
13 The second respondent ('GPT') has interests in the Application Area as a freeholder and leaseholder.
The applicants seek no relief against GPT and it has not played an active part in the proceedings.
Accordingly, when I refer to 'the respondents' in this judgment I intend, unless the context indicates otherwise, to refer only to the Territory and the Commonwealth.
14 Although the respondents raise many issues, their primary submission is that, regardless of the dates of the compensation acts relied on by the applicants, they have failed to establish that members of the compensation claim group held traditional native rights or interests in the Application Area when the compensation acts occurred.
They say that it is essential to focus on the case pleaded by the applicants in the Third Further Amended Points of Claim ('Points of Claim'), to which the applicants adhered in final submissions.
On that basis, the respondents contend that the applicants have not established that members of the compensation claim group acknowledged and observed the traditional laws and customs pleaded in the Points of Claim.
In any event, the respondents contend that the laws and customs so pleaded have not been shown to be the traditional laws and customs of the Western Desert bloc, as required by s 223(1) of the NTA .
15 In addition, the respondents dispute many of the applicants' contentions relating to extinguishment of native title by reason of the compensation acts.
They do so on the assumption (contrary to their primary submissions) that the applicants can establish that they held native title rights and interests in the Application Area in accordance with the traditional laws and customs of the Western Desert bloc when the various compensation acts took place.
The respondents submit that, even on that assumption, the applicants' claim for compensation must fail.
Although the arguments of the Commonwealth and the Territory are not identical, they say that native title rights and interests were extinguished prior to the NTA coming into force, in circumstances not giving rise to any rights to compensation under the NTA .
In the alternative, they say that the extinguishment of native title is taken to have occurred earlier than the applicants suggest and that, therefore, members of the compensation claim group are not entitled to compensation for the value of buildings or works constructed on the Application Area.
16 This judgment is not concerned with the amount of compensation payable to, or for the benefit of, members of the compensation claim group, should the applicants' claim ultimately succeed.
An order was made in the proceedings, pursuant to the Federal Court Rules (' FCR '), O 29 r 2: 
 
 'that the trial of issues relating to the liability (if any) to pay compensation under the [NTA] and the determination of what (if any) native title rights existed in the claim area before the alleged extinguishing acts be heard and determined separately from and before the trial of issues relating to the quantum of compensation to be awarded if such liability is established'.

 

17 To prevent duplication in the taking of evidence, the orders also provided that lay evidence as to the impact or effect of the alleged extinguishing acts upon the compensation claim group should be given at the trial on the issues relating to liability.
Although that evidence has been received, this judgment does not make findings concerning the impact of the compensation acts on individual members of the compensation claim group.
18 In his final submissions, Mr Basten QC, who appeared with Mr Parsons SC, Ms Keely and Mr Blowes for the applicants, emphasised that although the applicants seek compensation on behalf of the compensation claim group, they had not yet made a final decision as to whether they wish to press for monetary compensation.
Mr Basten pointed out that s 51(6) of the NTA permits a person claiming to be entitled to compensation to request that the whole or part of the compensation should consist of the transfer of property or the provision of goods or services.
In such a case, the Court may recommend that the person liable to pay compensation transfer property or provide goods or services in accordance with the recommendation.
19 The applicants' written submissions state that at this stage of the litigation, assuming they succeed, they are not asking the Court to identify each person entitled to compensation.
The applicants say that they would be satisfied with a description of the class or classes of persons who are entitled to compensation, framed with reference to the particular laws and customs of the eastern Western Desert.
However, in final submissions, Mr Basten applied to amend the pleadings to incorporate an alternative case whereby the compensation claim group consists of a number of identified persons.
I deal with that application later (section 10.5, below).
