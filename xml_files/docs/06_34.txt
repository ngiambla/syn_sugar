 
 INTRODUCTION 
 
1 This is a design case in which the applicants claimed injunctive relief and damages for infringement of the first applicant's registered designs in respect of plates or, at the first applicant's option, an account of profits in respect of the infringement of its designs.
On 7 September 2004, I published reasons for judgment on liability: Willis Tu v Pakway Australia Pty Ltd [2004] FCA 1151 (" Willis Tu ").
I found that the first and second respondents had infringed the registered designs.
The applicants elected to have an account of profits and, by agreement, the parties subsequently settled on $36,728 as the amount of profit.
The parties were, however, unable to agree on costs and have filed submissions concerning a number of costs questions.
The question of costs now falls for determination.
THE PARTIES' SUBMISSIONS 
 
2 The respondents concede that the applicants are entitled to a general order for costs in their favour.
However, they submit that they are entitled to costs that were reserved in connection with the application for an interlocutory injunction and the notice of motion filed on 13 February 2002.
The respondents also claim that the applicants should not recover costs relating to affidavits of Robin Walton, the evidence of Peter Kingsley Bayly, and the retention of two counsel for trial.
3 The applicants submit that there is no reason to depart from, or modify, the application of the general rule that costs follow the event.
Moreover, they submit that the Court should order that costs not be reduced by one-third pursuant to O 62 r 36A(1) of the Federal Court Rules 1979 (Cth) ("the Rules").
CONSIDERATION 
 
4 The power of the Court to make orders for costs derives from s 43 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth).
A successful litigant is ordinarily entitled to an award of costs: see, e.g., Oshlack v Richmond River Council [1998] HCA 11 ; (1998) 193 CLR 72 at 97 per McHugh J (dissenting in result) and 120-1 per Kirby J.
The power to make orders for costs is, however, discretionary, although it "must be exercised judicially and not against the successful party except for some reason connected with the case": see Ruddock v Vadarlis (No 2) [2001] FCA 1865 ; (2001) 115 FCR 229 (" Ruddock v Vadarlis (No 2) ") at 234 per Black CJ and French JJ.
