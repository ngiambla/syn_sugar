 1 This is an appeal under s 44(1) of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth) (" AAT Act ") from a decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal ("AAT") constituted by Senior Member Kelly dated 24 May 2005.
On that date, Senior Member Kelly affirmed a decision of a delegate of the respondent ("CRS") made on 16 April 2004 refusing the applicant's request for documents made pursuant to s 15 of the Freedom of Information Act 1982 (Cth) (" FOI Act ").
2 The applicant filed a notice of appeal from Senior Member Kelly's decision on 7 June 2005.
She filed a supplementary notice of appeal on 16 March 2006.
3 Whilst not opposed to the filing of the supplementary notice, CRS points out that many of the seventeen questions stated in the original and supplementary notice do not state questions of law; see TNT Skypak International (Aust) Pty Limited v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1988) 82 ALR 175 at 178; Birdseye v Australian Securities and Investments Commission (2003) 76 ALD 321 at [11]; Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Saxby Bridge Financial Planning Pty Limited [2003] FCAFC 244 ; (2003) 133 FCR 290 at [42] .
4 Most of the background facts, as well as the decision of Senior Member Kelly, have been set out in my judgment in matter NSD 55 of 2005, handed down contemporaneously with this judgment; see Lawrance v President, Administrative Appeal Tribunal [2006] FCA 342.
5 It is necessary to add only briefly to what I have already said about the background and the decision under appeal.


 Supplementary Background Facts 
 
 6 In her request for documents under the FOI Act dated 23 February 2004, the applicant explained that whilst she had "never been aware or conscious of having had CRS involvement in any aspect of my employment or my life", she came to believe "with hindsight" that there had been some sort of involvement.
7 At a time which is not precisely clear, but certainly by early 2004, the applicant came to believe that she has been the subject of a Commonwealth program administered by CRS under a contract or other arrangement with her various employers.
She believes that the program has been provided under the Disability Services Act 1986 (Cth) (" DSA "), and includes non-consensual treatment and covert surveillance.
She also believes that former friends, in particular Ms Beverly Smith ("Ms Smith"), a former CRS employee, have been involved in the program and have contacted the applicant's family.
8 The essence of the applicant's complaint is set out in a letter which she wrote to the President of the AAT on 28 April 2004.
9 The letter of 28 April 2004 includes the following:-
 "I had a friend, Bev Smith, who was coincidentally a CRS employee.
I was told by a former friend Andrea Howard, in 1999 that 'Bev Smith was no friend to you', (she has never even met Bev Smith), a comment she refused to explain or elaborate on, and it has only been since that astonishing comment that I have had cause to reflect on exactly why that comment may have been made.
I have never realized or imagined or known of any CRS activity in relation to my employment and it has been a great shock to wonder what on earth has been going on.
Former friends who make that sort of comment, having had no connections with my employment or with Bev Smith, seem to indicate that there is much that Bev Smith has done which has been extremely devious, manipulative, dishonest and totally behind my back.
This may also apply to Louise Perrottet, also a CRS employee and a social acquaintance known to me through Andrea Howard.
They were friends at university but had not pursued a close friendship for years and had not been a part of any joint socialising since Andrea's wedding over fifteen or so years ago.
Louise knew little other than what I told her (virtually nothing) of my employment and was certainly not a person to whom I would have discussed work related things with nor a person with whom I would ever have made a confidant of in that respect.
I would never, ever have consented to her having any involvement whatsoever in my personal or employment affairs, being an independent, autonomous person who highly valued her privacy and who has no and had no disability or psychiatric disorder.
Thus any involvement she may have had in my circumstances has been devious, behind my back, unethical and like Bev Smith, ultra vires the Disability Services Act (Cth) and in disregard of my rights to privacy and in breach of anti-discrimination legislation.

 
 This detail is all relevant as I am seeking access to records setting out all these womens' involvement in my employment, as they have done so in a professional capacity not in a social capacity (obviously) --- as employees of CRS and/or similar organizations or in a similar capacity.
Such conduct is not only the antithesis of friendship but is also unlawful and where it has occurred, has done so completely without my knowledge or consent.
The records I am seeking access to thus include email records of the individuals concerned as well as all other records and documents.

 
 On 23 February 2004 I wrote to CRS Australia requesting full and comprehensive access to all records and documents of personal and health information, including all emails sent by and received from Bev Smith and Louise Perrottet and Anne Brimson and others, relating to my employment at Centrelink, the Department of Social Security, the SSAT and the RRT.
I requested information that might be held electronically, including email records and the like.

 
 I also made it clear that although I have never ever qualified for CRS intervention --- eg I have never met the criteria set out in s 18 of the Disability Services Act (Cth) 1986, nor have I ever had and nor do I have a disability, or a psychiatric disorder, it seemed apparent that CRS had indeed involved themselves at some stage in my employment.
