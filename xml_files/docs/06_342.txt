1 In April 2004, the applicant brought a number of proceedings in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal ("the AAT"), five of which sought review of decisions by various government bodies to refuse requests for documents made by the applicant under the Freedom of Information Act (1982) (Cth) (" FOI Act" ).
The requests were refused in each case pursuant to s 24A of the FOI Act because each relevant body was satisfied that all reasonable steps had been taken to find the documents and that they did not exist.
2 The government agencies or bodies named in the AAT proceedings, the fifth to tenth respondents in these proceedings, are CRS Australia ("CRS"), the Social Security Appeals Tribunal ("SSAT"), Centrelink ("Centrelink"), the Refugee Review Tribunal ("the RRT"), the Department Of Family And Community Services ("the Department") and the Human Rights And Equal Opportunity Commission ("HREOC").
3 CRS provides vocational rehabilitation under the Disability Services Act (1986) (Cth) (" DSA ").
A finding of fact has been made by the AAT that CRS does not provide rehabilitation services without the consent of a client and that CRS does not conduct surveillance.
4 Nevertheless, the applicant believes that, without her consent, CRS has been providing non-consensual treatment to her for a psychiatric disorder which she says she does not have, and that she has been subject to covert surveillance by CRS.
5 The FOI requests which the applicant made were for all personal information and health information held which related to her, spanning a lengthy period from 1986 to 2004.
The information sought included email records of a number of persons including the fourth respondent ("Ms Smith"), as well as a Ms Louise Perrottet ("Ms Perrottet") and a Ms Andrea Howard ("Ms Howard").
6 Ms Smith was an employee of CRS, at least up until 2002.
She was also a personal friend of the applicant during the period from 1992 to 1999, when the friendship ceased.
The applicant believes that during the time when Ms Smith was employed by CRS, she provided or was involved in the unauthorised provision by CRS of "eligible services" to the applicant under the DSA and that CRS has documents, including electronic material, which record that activity.
The applicant also believes that Ms Smith lied to the AAT when she gave evidence on 1 November 2004 that her relationship with the applicant was purely personal and that there are no such documents.
7 The applicant firmly believes that Ms Smith has wrongly imputed a psychiatric disorder to her and that Ms Smith has, in breach of various Commonwealth statutes, including the DSA Act , the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 (Cth) (the " Sex Discrimination Act "), and privacy legislation, made contact with the applicant's family.
8 Ms Smith was a friend of Ms Perrottet.
Ms Perrottet was also at one time an employee of CRS, having apparently left in 1994.
She is not a party to these proceedings but she gave evidence in the AAT, which was accepted, that she was unaware of any activity by CRS concerning the applicant.
9 Ms Howard was a friend of the applicant and of Ms Perrottet.
It appears that Ms Howard was not a friend of Ms Smith and she may not have known her.
10 The applicant has given sworn evidence that in 1999, Ms Howard told the applicant that "Bev Smith was no friend to you".
This brief remark, the evidence on which does not establish the context in which it was made, eventually became the source of the applicant's belief that CRS, through Ms Smith, had engaged in unauthorised treatment and surveillance of her.
11 The applicant was, at various times, employed by some of the respondents.
She was employed by the Department of Social Security (which is now Centrelink) from 1986 to 1992.
She was a member of the SSAT from 1992 to 1997; she was employed by Centrelink from November 1997 to August 1998 and by the RRT from August 1998 to January 2001.
She was never employed by CRS.
12 In January 2001, the applicant resigned from the RRT, or was, as she contends, constructively dismissed.
At that time she believed that she had been discriminated against by the RRT, and from about 1995, in her employment with the SSAT.
She believes that she was discriminated against on the basis of her marital status and because people wrongly attributed to her a disability or incapacity, that is to say, a psychiatric condition.
13 The FOI requests to which I referred above were made to CRS, the SSAT, Centrelink, the RRT, the Department, and HREOC in about early 2004.
Applications for review by the AAT were filed in or about April 2004.
14 In about September 2004, the applicant sought, in each of the proceedings in the AAT, a direction pursuant to s 35(2) of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth) (" AAT Act ") , that the hearing of her application take place in private, that her name and the names of witnesses not be published, that evidence given at the hearings be prohibited from publication, and that any written decision of the AAT have a restricted distribution.
15 The reason given by the applicant for this request was:-
 
 "I have been and continue to be subject to unlawful discrimination and victimisation; because publication of inaccurate or defamatory material --- should such be forthcoming --- is prejudicial to me and my reputation and may be unfairly prejudicial to other proceedings including court proceedings; and because owing to false and misleading information I have been unable to obtain a fair hearing to date in other jurisdictions.
" 
 

16 On 27 October 2004, the third respondent to these proceedings ("Senior Member Allen") handed down a joint set of reasons in the six applications refusing to make the orders sought by the applicant.
17 On 1 November 2004, the applicant's proceeding against CRS in the AAT was before the second respondent to the present proceeding ("Senior Member Kelly") for hearing.
The applicant made a further request under s 35(2) of the AAT Act for the hearing to take place in private and for suppression orders.
Senior Member Kelly refused the request.
18 Evidence was given before Senior Member Kelly by a number of persons including Ms Smith and Ms Perrottet.
19 On 13 January 2005, before Senior Member Kelly had handed down her decision, the applicant commenced the present proceedings in the Federal Court.
On 10 February 2005 she was given leave to file an amended application dated 14 January 2005.
Relief is sought under s 39B of the Judiciary Act (1903) (Cth) (" Judiciary Act ") .
20 The amended application seeks four categories of orders against the various respondents.
21 The first category relates to the decision of Senior Member Allen dated 27 October 2004 refusing the applicant's application for orders under s 35(2) of the AAT Act .
She seeks orders quashing the decision and removing it from publication.
She also seeks an order of mandamus, requiring the President of the AAT to make orders under s 35(2) prohibiting the publication of the names of witnesses and their evidence in the various AAT proceedings.
22 The second category arises out of the application heard by Senior Member Kelly on 
1 November 2004.
The applicant seeks an order prohibiting the learned member from making her decision and orders removing her from the conduct of the review.
However, I refused to grant interlocutory relief which sought to prevent Senior Member Kelly from making her decision; see [2005] FCA 79.
Leave to appeal from my judgment was refused by Hely J; see [2005] FCA 541.
The request for such orders in the present proceedings has thus been overtaken by the publication of Senior Member Kelly's decision on 24 May 2005.
23 The third category is an order of mandamus directed to the President of the AAT ordering him to compel the attendance of witnesses who have been issued with summonses in the various AAT proceedings.
24 The fourth category is directed against Ms Smith.
The applicant seeks orders preventing Ms Smith from giving false evidence in the AAT as well as an order prohibiting Ms Smith from imputing to the applicant a disability which she does not have.
25 Ms Smith's actions are said to be in breach of the Sex Discrimination Act , the Disability Discrimination Act 1992 (Cth) (" DDA ")and the DSA .
A real question arises as to whether the Federal Court has jurisdiction in respect of the claims against Ms Smith.
26 The essence of Senior Member Kelly's decision of 24 May 2005 was that all reasonable steps had been taken by CRS to find the documents the subject of the applicant's request and that the documents do not exist.

 
27 The learned Senior Member accepted the evidence of Ms Smith that her relationship with the applicant was purely one of friendship.
She found that any emails created by Ms Smith during her time at CRS were personal and would have been deleted.
She also found that, apart from the applicant's belief, there was no evidence to suggest any connection between CRS and the applicant.
28 The applicant has filed a separate proceeding in this Court purportedly to appeal on a question of law from the decision of Senior Member Kelly.
I heard that application immediately after the conclusion of the hearing in the present matter.
It is the subject of a separate judgment.
The Decision of Senior Member Allen 
 
29 In late September 2004, the applicant requested a directions hearing in the AAT, to take place before the final hearing on 1 November 2004, for the purpose of considering her request for orders under s 35(2) of the AAT Act .
30 All six matters in the AAT came before Senior Member Allen to determine the request for confidentiality orders.
As I have said, the learned Senior Member handed down a joint decision on all the applications on 27 October 2004.
31 The reasons for Senior Member Allen's decision are short.
He saw no authority in s 35 for a direction that an applicant's name be suppressed and that she be known by an acronym; see at [6].
32 Senior Member Allen said at [8], that apart from specific legislative requirements such as under the Taxation Administration Act 1953 (Cth) and a number of other provisions, 
 s 35(3) of the AAT Act must be given its full force and effect.
33 I will refer in more detail to that provision below.
It is sufficient to observe that 
 s 35(3) provides that in considering an application for confidentiality, the AAT is to take the principle of open justice as the basis for its consideration, but is required to pay due regard to reasons put by an applicant against that principle.
34 As to the principles to be applied, Senior Member Allen referred to the judgment of Brennan J in Re Pochi and Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (1979) 26 ALR 247 (" Re Pochi") at 272 --- 273.
His Honour said that an order excluding the public may be more justified than an order excluding a party but that strict criteria govern the making of such an order.
There must appear to be a real possibility of injustice to, or a serious disadvantage upon, a party or a witness or it must clearly appear that publication of the proceeding would be contrary to the public interest.
35 Senior Member Allen also referred to the judgment of Merkel J in Herald  Weekly Times Limited v Williams [2003] FCAFC 217 ; (2003) 130 FCR 435 (" Herald  Weekly Times") in which his Honour adopted the observations of Kirby P in John Fairfax Group Pty Ltd (Receivers and Managers Appointed) v Local Court of New South Wales (1991) 26 NSWLR 131 (" John Fairfax" ).
There, the learned President, as he then was, pointed out at 142 that:-
 
 "A significant reason for adhering to a stringent principle, despite sympathy for those who suffer embarrassment, invasions of privacy or even damage by publicity of their proceedings is that such interests must be sacrificed in the greater public interest in adhering to an open system of justice.
" 
 

36 Senior Member Allen observed that the policy reasons for adhering to an open system of justice were stated by Lord Atkinson and Lord Shaw in Scott v Scott [1913] AC 417 at 463 and 484-485 respectively.
37 The reasons for Senior Member Allen's decision were then stated at [11] --- [13] as follows:-
 
 "Notwithstanding practical difficulties, there must be shown some reason as to why justice cannot be done between the parties without the making of an order pursuant to s 35 before the Tribunal can make such an order.
I do not regard possible embarrassment to an Applicant as a sufficient reason; see Kirby P (as he then was) in John Fairfax v Local Court (supra).

 
 In particular, the AAT as a superior Tribunal should be very loath to consent to its proceedings taking place in private.
It is not uncommon that during an AAT hearing some maladministration will be evidenced and it is proper that such bureaucratic failures be exposed.
Similarly, errors of administration exposed in one matter may be applicable to numerous other matters.
Invariably one of the parties to any review before the AAT is a government department or instrumentality therefore proceedings before the AAT should be in public, for to use the words of Lord Atkinson quoted above, the hearing of a case in public is 'the best security for pure, impartial and efficient administration of justice, the best means for winning for it public confidence and respect'.
To create a review body that restricts, or worse denies, legal representation and then sits in private is to recreate the Star Chamber.

 
 
 
 
 
 In this matter the Applicant has failed to demonstrate that the failure to make an order under ss 35(2) AAT Act would in any way prejudice her case and I refuse the application.
" 


 Background including request for records under the FOI Act 
 
38 On 23 February 2004, the applicant made a request to CRS for full access to all records of personal information about her or referring to her that were held by CRS.
She said that she had serious concerns about the reasons for personal information ever being collected and the lawful basis of CRS for doing so.
39 The applicant stated in her request that she had no disability or psychiatric condition or disorder and accordingly that she did not meet the criteria stated in s 18 of the DSA for the provision of services by CRS.
40 The applicant went on to say:-
 
 "However I now believe, in hindsight, that there has been some sort of CRS involvement in my employment and indeed possibly in my present circumstances.
If this is the case, I wish to make it clear that I am requesting under s 21A of the DSA the cessation immediate of any and all CRS involvement with me.
I am also requesting that CRS, and certain officers like Bev Smith and Louise Perrottet and, (I am not sure if she has been a CRS employee), Anne Brimson (who still has to respond to complaints about her), respond to the complaints of unlawful discrimination under the Disability Discrimination Act (Cth) 1992 (the DDA) and the Sex Discrimination Act (Cth) 1984 (the SDA) that I lodged with the Human Rights  Equal Opportunity Commission on 16 September 2003.
" 
 

41 The applicant then said that she had reason to believe that Ms Smith had involved herself with the applicant's employment during her time at the SSAT.
She said that it came as a shock to her to learn that Ms Smith was "pursuing a friendship with me with a well hidden financial interest or ulterior motive in mind".
She continued:-
 
 "I believe that CRS, Bev Smith and Louise Perrottet in particular, have involved themselves in my employment at the SSAT, and that Anne Brimson has involved herself with my employment at Centrelink and the RRT, and that CRS has involved itself with my circumstances generally since my departure from the public service.
That involvement has included a belated and unsuccessful attempt to have me diagnosed (and thereby try to justify years of unlawful activity).
I believe that Anne Brimson and Andrea Taylor have been involved very heavily in attempts to classify me as a person with particular psychiatric disabilities (such as dissociative disorder; schizophrenia; a manic or a bipolar disorder) and that this occurred with a great momentum when I commenced working at the RRT.
I believe her activity has been encouraged by persons associated with a campaign of victimisation waged by Annette O'Neill, Jenny D'Arcy, Stephen Hodges, Lyn Rogers, Angela Becket and Amanda MacDonald of the SSAT, because of my 1995 complaint against Stephen Hodges.
Indeed, I believe that CRS have become a vehicle for that victimisation.
Anne Brimson's conduct and the related activity of CRS has been unlawful under both the DDA and the SDA, and unauthorized by the DSA and any other applicable legislation.
If a person does not fall within the target group then no CRS activity can be lawfully undertaken.
" 
 

42 The applicant said she believed that CRS had covertly contacted her family and a wide range of relatives, friends and acquaintances.
This she said was done without any lawful basis.
Reference was made to the DSA, the DDA , the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth), the Information Privacy Principles and the National Privacy Principles.
43 The applicant summarised her request for information as follows:-
 
 "In summary, I am seeking access to all personal information, including sensitive personal information and health information, held on me by CRS, from 1986 to 2004, whether such documents are at the Darlinghurst CRS Unit, Sussex St or elsewhere, and including but not limited to records of all email activity and other communications in particular those engaged in by Bev Smith, Anne Brimson and Louise Perrottet, A Taylor, L Howe and A Howard ..." 
 

44 The applicant then set out a lengthy series of questions apparently designed to elicit information from CRS as to whether it had collected personal information and health information about her and to whom such information had been disclosed.
45 The questions included "why did Andrea Howard say in 1999 'Bev Smith was no friend to you'?
" and other questions concerning what health information CRS had about medication administered to the applicant without her consent and what surveillance had been conducted on her.
46 Other requests for information in wide terms appear to have been made to the other relevant respondents; see Lawrance v Administrative Appeals Tribunal [2005] FCA 1318.
47 On 8 March 2004, CRS replied to the applicant's request.
CRS said:-
 
 " - CRS Australia provides vocational rehabilitation, under the Disability Services Act (Cth) 1986.
Vocational rehabilitation is a voluntary process and all CRS Australia vocational rehabilitation programs are provide (sic) in consultation with the client; 
 - CRS Australia does not conduct surveillance, and does not endorse the collection of personal information without the individual's knowledge and consent; 
 - Following searches of CRS Australia electronic records, using the details provided in your letter, I can confirm that CRS Australia has no record of you being a CRS Australia client, employee or contractor; 
 - If you had been a CRS Australia client at anytime between 1986 and 2004; an electronic record of your involvement with CRS Australia would have been made; 
 - CRS Australia does not hold personal or health information about individuals who are not CRS Australia clients, employees or contractors; 
 - All correspondence about clients, including correspondence via e-mail and facsimile, is kept in hard copy on the client's CRS Australia file.
" 
 
 

48 CRS concluded by saying that in accordance with s 24A of the FOI Act , CRS was unable to provide the information requested.
CRS stated that all reasonable steps had been taken to find the documents and that none could be found or did not exist.
49 On 15 March 2004, the applicant requested an internal review from CRS under s 54 of the FOI Act of its decision to refuse access.
50 On 16 April 2004, CRS informed the applicant that it had conducted an internal review but that its decision under s 24A of the FOI Act was that all reasonable steps had been taken and that the documents could not be found or did not exist.
51 The applicant appears to have taken similar steps in respect of her other applications for information.
52 The applicant lodged her application for review by the AAT of CRS's decision on 29 April 2004.
Applications for review by the AAT of the other decisions were made at about the same time.
53 On 10 May 2004, a conversation took place between the applicant and Ms Janine Wood ("Ms Wood"), the Legal Policy Manager for National Service Delivery Support for CRS.
Ms Wood was the person who supervised the processing of requests for information under the FOI Act made to CRS.
Ms Wood made a file note of the conversation as follows:-
 
 "10/5/04 Return call from Bev Smith.
Bev stated she had been a friend of Ms Lawrance some years back dating from when they studied law together.
She stated her only contact had been on a personal basis, through studying  then a friendship.
At some point Ms Lawrance's behaviour changed and she accused Bev of interfering.
Bev cut contact with Ms Lawrance and has not had any dealings with her since 1999.
She recalls a letter from Ms Lawrance being passed on by a colleague 2 years ago, which had been sent to CRS.
Bev left CRS permanently in 2002.
She does not wish Ms Lawrance to know her contact details or home address, but would provide a statement regarding her dealings with Ms Lawrance if required.
She would not wish to meet up with or face Ms Lawrance.
