 
 1 Before the Court is an application for summary judgment brought pursuant to the former O 10 r 8 of the Federal Court Rules 1979 (Cth) ("the Rules") against the first and second respondents.
The applicant, Jun Xue Wu, made this application by a notice of motion filed on 4 August 2004, which was part-heard on various dates until 27 April 2005.
By her motion, Ms Wu seeks:
 
 "[L] eave ... to enter judgment against the First Respondent ... and the Second Respondent ... for: 
 
 
 (a) the debt or liquidated damages; and 
 (b) costs of the proceeding, including all reserved costs, to be taxed; and 
 (c) interest on the debt or liquidated amount since the date of issue of those proceedings.
" 
 


The circumstances attending the motion have changed over time.
For the following reasons, I would not make the orders in the terms sought in the applicant's motion, although I would order that (1) the first and second respondents pay Ms Wu's costs forthwith, on an indemnity basis, such costs to be taxed; (2) these respondents pay the taxed costs within 14 days from the service of a certificate of taxation; and (3) in default of such payment, Ms Wu have leave to enter judgment against them for $334,000 and interest thereon.
THE CLAIMS 
 
2 Ms Wu filed her application and statement of claim on 9 May 2003.
By her statement of claim, she alleges, amongst other things, that the first to fifth respondents breached ss 51AA , 52 and 53 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) ("the TPA") and ss 7 , 9 , 11 and 12 of the Fair Trading Act 1999 (Vic) ("the FTA"), or were knowingly concerned in such breaches.
It is unnecessary to refer to the other causes of action that she asserts.
She seeks declaratory relief and damages.
3 Her statement of claim makes the following factual allegations.
She maintains that Barry Armitage (the second respondent) was the director of Avin Operations Pty Ltd ("Avin") (the first respondent), father to Christopher Armitage (the third respondent), husband to Joan Armitage (the fourth respondent) and a former director of Asia Pacific Coating Pty Ltd (the fifth respondent).
She alleges that, on or about 22 July 1997, she conducted negotiations with Barry and Christopher Armitage concerning a proposed investment of $334,000 by her in Avin.
She further alleges that the second and third respondents represented that, if she invested monies in Avin, then (1) she would become a "joint-owner" and "partner" in Avin; (2) she would be repaid the money at the end of a two-year period commencing 25 July 1997; (3) she would assume a management role in the day-to-day running of Avin's business; (4) Avin was a successful company that would be able to repay the loan; (5) Barry Armitage was a registered migration agent and a lawyer skilled in migration matters; (6) Barry Armitage would be able to fill in the forms for permanent residence and Australian citizenship for her and act on her behalf in respect of these applications; and (7) upon investing the money and assuming a management role in the business, she would be eligible to obtain permanent resident status and Australian citizenship.
4 Ms Wu maintains that, pursuant to an agreement made on 25 July 1997 between her and Avin, she lent the sum of $334,000 to Avin.
She says that the first and fifth respondents used the loan monies for their own purposes and that, despite her requests, she has not been repaid.
She alleges that (1) none of the respondents intended that she would become a partner or co-owner, with a management role as represented; (2) Avin's business was not profitable and the company was unable to repay the loan to her; (3) Barry Armitage was neither a registered migration agent nor a lawyer skilled in migration matters; (4) Barry Armitage did not assist her as he represented he would; and (5) she has not been granted permanent residence or Australian citizenship.
5 By their defence, the respondents state that the fifth respondent was wound up by order of the Supreme Court on 17 September 2003.
Barry Armitage admits that, on or about 22 July 1997, he engaged in negotiations with Ms Wu, assisted by Ms Minnie Xia, concerning a proposal to invest some $175,000 in Avin.
Avin and Barry, Christopher and Joan Armitage otherwise deny Ms Wu's claims.
They say that there were negotiations with a Mr Gu to invest a like amount in the company; and that Ms Wu and Mr Gu invested $325,082.07 in Avin pursuant to agreements made with them.
They also say that this agreement gave Ms Wu the option of withdrawing her investment by giving 3 months' notice at any time for up to 2 years from the date of her contribution and she did not exercise the option.
They allege that the communications with Ms Wu were entirely through Ms Xia, who advised Barry Armitage that they had arranged to take all documents to a Chinese speaking lawyer in Melbourne and that they had visited this lawyer.
RELEVANT BACKGROUND 
 
6 Ms Wu's application for judgment is based on a claim that there is a history of delay and non-compliance with the Court's orders by Avin and Barry Armitage.
Accordingly, the procedural background of this case is relevant to Ms Wu's application.
7 As already noted, Ms Wu filed her application and statement of claim on 9 May 2003.
On 12 and 14 August 2003, she filed notices of motion seeking an order for substituted service of the originating process on Barry and Joan Armitage.
On 12 August 2003, Ms Wu filed affidavits sworn by the process servers Michael Barnett, John Ioannou, Steve Vlachos, Fotios Karamouratidis and Raymond Smith.
In these affidavits, the process servers claimed that, despite their best efforts, they were unable to serve these two respondents.
Mr Vlachos affirmed that he was able to serve Christopher Armitage by placing a sealed copy of the application and statement of claim under the windscreen wiper of his vehicle while he was stopped at traffic lights.
There were also other affidavits filed in support of the motion.
8 On 20 August 2003, the Court made an order for substituted service.
On 12 September 2003, all but Christopher Armitage filed a notice of appearance.
Christopher Armitage filed a notice of conditional appearance (which was followed by a regular notice of appearance on 8 October 2003).
Joseph Guss, solicitor, then represented the respondents.
9 As indicated, on 17 September 2003, the fifth respondent was wound up by order of the Supreme Court of Victoria.
This proceeding was stayed against it by virtue of s 471B of the Corporations Act 2000 (Cth).
10 On 8 October 2003, the remaining respondents filed a defence.
Also on that day, the parties, through their legal representatives, appeared before a Registrar of this Court for directions.
The Registrar ordered that the parties exchange lists of discoverable documents by 10 November 2003; that inspection be completed by 24 November 2003; and that the matter be referred to mediation by 19 December 2003, with costs reserved.
On 12 November 2003, Ms Wu filed her list of documents.
The remaining respondents failed to comply with the Registrar's orders relating to discovery.
11 On 1 December 2003, Ms Wu filed a notice of motion, returnable on 16 December 2003, seeking orders that the respondents file and serve their lists of documents.
On 15 December 2003, Christopher and Joan Armitage filed lists of documents.
