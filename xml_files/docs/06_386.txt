 RESPONDENT 

 JUDGE: HEEREY J DATE: 7 APRIL 2006 PLACE: MELBOURNE 
 
 
 
 RULING 
 
 

 1 The applicant Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd (Cadbury) has brought this proceeding against the respondent Darrell Lea Chocolate Shops Pty Ltd (Darrell Lea) alleging contravention of ss 52 , 53 (c) and 53 (d) of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) and passing off constituted by Darrell Lea's use in its chocolate confectionary business of "the colour Cadbury purple or any colour bearing a striking and obvious likeness to the colour Cadbury purple".
2 A number of witnesses called by Cadbury produced various market research documents.
The makers of such documents were not called.
I ruled that these documents were admissible as going to the reasons why Cadbury's officers caused the company to take certain courses of action in the marketing and packaging of its products.
However, I held that such documents were not proof of the truth of their contents, for example what various respondents to market surveys had said to the persons who conducted them.
In other words, the documents were received on a non-hearsay basis and not as evidence of the truth of what they asserted.
3 Whether right or wrong, I think it is clear that that is the basis on which I admitted the documents.
Nevertheless some uncertainty has arisen.
Accordingly further argument took place in which, amongst other things, more informative reference was made to s 60 of the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth) (the Act) and its application by the High Court in Lee v The Queen [1998] HCA 60 ; (1998) 195 CLR 594.
