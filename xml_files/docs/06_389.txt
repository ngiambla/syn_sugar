 
1 Mr David has a grievance with the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal.
The grievance stems from his concern that the Tribunal has not dealt with a complaint he lodged with it to the effect that the trustee of his superannuation fund has not credited his superannuation accounts with the correct figures.
2 Mr David filed an application under s 7(1) of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 (Cth) in this Court.
His concern is that the Tribunal has not made a decision dealing with his complaint.
He claims to be aggrieved by the failure of the Tribunal to make a decision on the matters raised in his complaint.
Mr David named the chairperson of the Tribunal as the second respondent and MLC Nominees Pty Ltd as the third respondent.
MLC is the trustee of Mr David's superannuation fund.
3 Sundberg J transferred the application to the Federal Magistrates Court.
The application was heard by Federal Magistrate Phipps on 9 November 2005.
On 22 December 2005 his Honour published reasons of judgment dismissing the application.
The issue for determination in this proceeding is whether his Honour erred in holding that the Tribunal had not failed to make a decision, or delayed unreasonably in making a decision, in relation to Mr David's complaint.
4 The Federal Magistrate noted that Mr David lodged his complaint with the Tribunal on 8 February 2005.
