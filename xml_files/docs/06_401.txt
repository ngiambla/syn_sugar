 
 1 This is an application by Ms Loris Johnston ('the applicant') for an extension of time to file and serve a Notice of Appeal from the decision of Federal Magistrate Jarrett made on 30 September 2005, wherein the learned Federal Magistrate refused an order that the applicant's bankruptcy be annulled pursuant to s 153B Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth) ('the Act').
2 The respondent to this application is the petitioning creditor to the bankruptcy of the applicant.
Another creditor, I  L Securities Pty Ltd ('I  L Securities'), and the trustee in bankruptcy were also represented at the hearing.
3 Time limits for filing and serving a notice of appeal from a decision of the Court or the Federal Magistrates Court are determined by O 52 r 15 Federal Court Rules .
This rule provides as follows:
 
 '(1) The notice of appeal shall be filed and served - 
 
 
 (a) within 21 days after - 
 
 
 
 
 (i) the date when the judgment appealed from was pronounced; 
 (ii) the date when leave to appeal was granted; or 
 (iii) any later date fixed for that purpose by the court appealed from; or 
 
 
 
 
 (b) within such further time as is allowed by the Court or a Judge upon application made by motion upon notice filed within the period of 21 days referred to in the last preceding paragraph.

 
 
 (2) Notwithstanding anything in the preceding sub-rule, the Court of a Judge for special reasons may at any time give leave to file and serve a notice of appeal.
' 

4 It is common ground that the applicant did not file and serve a notice of appeal within 21 days after 30 September 2005, nor did she apply to this Court for further time within that 21 days to file and serve a notice of appeal.
Accordingly, the application before me is for leave pursuant to O 52 r 15(2) to file and serve a notice of appeal.
In considering this application I note that I am exercising the appellate jurisdiction of the Federal Court, not the Court's original jurisdiction: Hall v Anderson (unreported Full Court of the Federal Court, 18 July 1997), Wati v MIMIA (1997) 78 FCR 543.
PRINCIPLES APPLICABLE TO EXTENDING TIME FOR LODGEMENT OF NOTICES OF APPEAL 
 
 5 Prima facie , time limits set by the Federal Court Rules , including those with respect to notices of appeal, are there to be observed by the parties.
However, O 52 r 15(2) vests a discretion in the Court to extend the time during which a notice of appeal may be lodged, in order to avoid injustice where a party has missed a prescribed deadline for lodgement ( Parker v The Queen [2002] FCAFC 133 at par 13).
'Special reasons' must be demonstrated in order for this rule to be invoked.
In considering the meaning of this term in Jess v Scott (unreported Full Court of the Federal Court, 4 November 1986), the Full Court said:
 
 'It is that there be shown a special reason why the appeal should be permitted to proceed, though filed after the expiry of twenty-one days.
In that context, the expression "special reasons" is intended to distinguish the case from the usual course according to which the time is twenty-one days.
But it may be so distinguished (not necessarily will, for the rule gives a discretion) wherever the Court sees a ground which does justify departure from the general rule in the particular case.
Such a ground is a special reason because it takes the case out of the ordinary.
We do not think the use of the expression "for special reasons" implies something narrower than this.
' (pp 18-19) 

6 The Full Court in Jess v Scott emphasised that, given the discretionary nature of the Court's power in O 52 r 15(2) to relax the requirement of the general rules, the power should not itself 'become entangled in a web of rules spun out of the Court's discretionary decisions'.
(p 20) However, there are a number of guiding principles which may assist the court in exercising its discretion.
These were described by Wilcox J in Hunter Valley Developments Pty Ltd v Cohen (1984) 3 FCR 344 at 348-349, and adopted by the Full Court in Parker v The Queen at par 6, as follows:
 
 
 1. applications for an extension of time are not to be granted unless it is proper to do so; the legislated time limits are not to be ignored.
The applicant must show an 'acceptable explanation for the delay'; it must be 'fair and equitable in the circumstances' to extend time;
 2. action taken by the applicant, other than by way of making an application for review, is relevant to the consideration of the question whether an acceptable explanation for the delay has been furnished;
 3. any prejudice to the respondent in defending the proceedings that is caused by the delay is a material factor militating against the grant of an extension;
 4. however, the mere absence of prejudice is not enough to justify the grant of an extension; and
 5. the merits of the substantial application are to be taken into account in considering whether an extension of time should be granted.

 

7 It is useful to examine the background to this case, and then return to these principles.
BACKGROUND 
 
8 The relevant facts of this case are set out in the judgment of Jarrett FM, delivered 30 September 2005.
9 As noted earlier in this judgment, the proceeding before the learned Federal Magistrate was an application, brought by the applicant in the case before me, for her bankruptcy to be annulled pursuant to s 153B of the Act.
Section 153B provides as follows:
 
 
 '(1) If the Court is satisfied that a sequestration order ought not to have been made or, in the case of a debtor's petition, that the petition ought not to have been presented or ought not to have been accepted by the Official Receiver, the Court may make an order annulling the bankruptcy.

 (2) In the case of a debtor's petition, the order may be made whether or not the bankrupt was insolvent when the petition was presented.
' 
 

10 The applicant became bankrupt following an order for the sequestration of her estate in accordance with s 43(2).
Therefore only s 153B(1) is relevant.
Section 153B(2) is irrelevant for the purposes of this application.
11 The debt which eventually formed the basis of the sequestration order related to monies claimed by the respondent, who was at one point the applicant's solicitor.
The debt was incurred for professional costs and outlays of the respondent in relation to litigation between the applicant and I  L Securities, and also in relation to a dispute between the applicant and a third party involving a storm water drain.
12 The litigation between the applicant and I  L Securities, which is described in some detail in the judgment of Jarrett FM, commenced in 1997, and included a successful default judgment obtained by I  L Securities in the District Court of Queensland in April 1999.
This default judgment was subsequently set aside.
I  L Securities applied for judgment again in June 2003 but I am unaware whether any orders have been made.
13 On 18 December 2002 the respondent issued proceedings out of the Magistrates Court of Queensland in Brisbane in relation to monies owed by the applicant, claiming $13 362.75 and interest.
The applicant did not file a defence to the respondent's claim, and default judgment was entered against her on 5 February 2004.
14 Relying on the default judgment of the Magistrates Court, the respondent issued a bankruptcy notice, which was served on the applicant.
15 It appears that on 19 May 2004, which was the same date as the hearing of the creditor's petition, the applicant filed an application to set aside the Magistrates Court judgment.
The applicant and the respondent agreed to compromise the respondent's claim by the applicant paying $6000, by instalments, in full and final satisfaction of the claim made by the respondent.
16 The agreement of the applicant and the respondent was formalised by a deed.
However, the applicant apparently did not pay any of the instalments agreed.
Consequently, the respondent sought to enforce the deed of settlement, and was successful in obtaining a second judgment against the applicant in the Magistrates Court of Queensland on the basis of the applicant's failure to comply with the deed.
A second bankruptcy notice ('the second bankruptcy notice') was issued by the respondent, based on this second judgment, and served on the applicant on 24 March 2005.
17 The respondent issued another creditor's petition ('the second creditor's petition') based on the applicant's failure to comply with the second bankruptcy notice.
A sequestration order was made against the applicant, based on this creditor's petition, on 18 May 2005.
18 In applying to Jarrett FM to have her bankruptcy annulled, the applicant's first ground was that she had never been served with the second creditor's petition.
This was contradicted by evidence of Mr Garry Robert Brian, a process server, who swore that he had served the applicant with the second creditor's petition at her premises.
At the hearing before Jarrett FM, both the applicant and the process server were extensively cross-examined in relation to this issue.
