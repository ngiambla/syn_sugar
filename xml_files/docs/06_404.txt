 NATURE OF THE CLAIM 
 
1 These proceedings, D6033 of 2001, are a consolidation of native title determination applications under the Native Title Act 1993 (Cth) (the NT Act), filed by three different groups of applicants in relation to land and waters in and around Darwin in the Northern Territory.
The applications were filed between 1994 and 2001.
2 There were three different groups of applicants encompassed within those 19 applications --- the 'Larrakia applicants' (the first applicants), the 'Quall applicants' (the second applicants) and the 'Roman applicants' (the third applicants).
The Larrakia applications were made by William Maxwell Risk (DG6007/1998; DG6017/1998; D6007/1999; D6018/1999 and D6026/2001), a deceased person Prince of Wales, Helen Secretary and Bill Risk (who is the same person as William Maxwell Risk) (DG6040 of 1998) and by Pauline Baban (D6001/1999).
The Quall applications were made by Kevin Lance ('Tibby') Quall (DG6010/1998; DG6011/1998; DG6012/1998; DG6013/1998; DG6014/1998; DG6015/1998; DG6018/1998; DG6019/1998; DG6022/1998; DG6026/1998; DG6029/1998).
The sole Roman application, D6007/2000, was made by Susan Linda Roman on behalf of the Yirra Bandoo Aboriginal Corporation.
3 The consolidated proceedings arose from orders made by a Registrar of the Court on 8 May 2001.
Those orders divided application DG6017/1998 (which covered the largest area) into Parts A and B.
Part A generally concerned the more urbanised areas in that claim.
Part A was to be considered before Part B.
The orders then also consolidated Part A of DG6017/1998 with the 18 other applications for the determination of native title into one action --- DG6033/2001.
The claim areas of the 18 other applications largely, but not entirely, overlapped with Part A of DG6017/1998.
The consolidating orders confined the consolidation to those parts of the other 18 claim areas which overlapped with Part A of DG6017/1998.
4 In the event, the hearing proceeded in respect of areas of land and waters in and around Darwin which did not precisely correspond with those areas of land the subject of the consolidated proceeding.
The hearing proceeded concerning 216 areas of land and waters described in the Consolidated Proceeding Claim Area List (the Claim Area List) prepared on behalf of the Northern Territory of Australia (the Territory) and the evidence related to those areas.
Each area of land and waters was given a 'C' designation and number.
That process was apparently adopted after consultation between the parties.
5 In the circumstances, I invited the parties to make submissions as to whether I should alter the consolidation order made on 8 May 2001 to reflect more accurately the matters which were addressed in the evidence.
No party contended that I should not do so.
Consequently, on 31 January 2005 the Court ordered that the Orders of a Registrar of the Court made 8 May 2001 be varied by the deletion of Order 2 and the insertion of the following in its place.
:
 
'2.

 (i) Part A of application DG6017 of 1998; and

be consolidated and the actions conducted as one ("the consolidated proceedings").

6 The Claim Area List indicates those parts of claims which do not overlap with the area encompassed by Part A of DG6017/1998.
I have excluded from the Claim Area List claim area C73 designated by the Territory because it does not appear to have been claimed in any proceeding, and claim area C83 because it too does not appear to have been claimed in any proceeding (except perhaps to the extent that it overlaps with claim area C81 claimed in DG6015/1998, and so is dealt with when addressing claim area C81.
As there is no claim for determination of native title over those two areas, I do not consider I have jurisdiction to make a determination with respect to them.
The remaining 214 claim areas designated in the Claim Area List are encompassed within the claims which, by reason of the order I have made, are before the Court.
7 Unless it is necessary to do so, I shall call the areas of land and waters collectively in the Claim Area List 'the claim area'.
I shall separately describe them only to the extent that it is necessary or would be helpful to an understanding of my reasons for judgment.
The Larrakia Applications 
 
8 The named applicants --- William Maxwell Risk, Helen Secretary and Pauline Baban and the deceased person Prince of Wales --- have made the applications on behalf of the 'Larrakia People'.
The members of this native title claim group are said to be the descendents of persons named in [6] of Schedule A to the application in DG6017 of 1998.
The nine ancestors listed in [6] include Minnie Lily, Fat Jack, Djalamin, King Tommy, Annie Duwun, Blanchie, Madjalaba, Kanjawone King Charles and Bessie.
Paragraph [6] further notes that the descendents of these nine ancestors comprise 19 Larrakia sub-groups or families, which are divided into seven groups: the Djalamin and King Tommy Families, the Blanchie Family, the Fejo Families and, under 'Other Families', Eva Humbatj, Minnie Lily, Yama Maudie Robinson and Annie Duwun.
9 In their written submissions, the first applicants assert that the native title claim group of the first applicants encompasses those who are the second applicants and the third applicants.
The first applicants' position is that they would regard a native title determination in which persons who hold native title are identified as Larrakia people as including those Aboriginal people who have participated as applicants in the consolidated proceeding, including those persons who fall within the second applicants and the third applicants.
The Quall Applications 
 
10 Mr Quall is the named applicant for the second applicant group.
As seen above, he filed 11 native title determination applications under the NT Act.
The native title claim group is referred to in DG6018/1998 and DG6019/1998 as 'members of the Danggalaba Clan', comprising eight people, including Mr Quall, Ronald Keith Quall, Diana Deeja Quall, Phillip Rupert Quall, Kevin Andrew Quall, Natasha Anne Quall, Sarah Audrey Quall and Linda Muriel Quall.
In other applications, the native title claim group is referred to as the 'Kulumbiringin', comprising the descendents of Kulumbiringin ancestors 'according to Aboriginal law and custom', including four elders and their family groups.
The four elders include Yula Williams, Mary Raymond, Rona Alley and Ron Quall.
As noted, all of the individuals named in the Quall applications are listed as Larrakia people in the list of Larrakia people on whose behalf the Larrakia applications are made.
11 Mr Quall, the named applicant for the second applicant group, submitted that the Larrakia people ought not be awarded native title over the claim area, as the group is simply a language group.
He submitted that the members of the Larrakia applicant groups have lost their culture, and that it is the Danggalaba clan (or the Kulumbiringin clan) who have continued to observe and acknowledge traditional laws and customs and to maintain their connection to the relevant land and waters.
The Roman Application 
 
12 The claim group in D6007/2000 is described in the application as 'Larrakia', the 'Yirra Bandoo Aboriginal Corporation' (YBAC), 'YBAC members' and the 'Yirra Bandoo native title group'.
In Attachment 2(a) to their application, it is stated that the Yirra Bandoo Aboriginal Corporation 'acknowledge, accept and support the rights of other Larrakia people to make application' but limit this to 'three broad groups that make up the Larrakia people'.
These groups include:
 
(1) Descendents of two brothers known as Djalamin and King Tommy.
These people constitute the 'Danggalaba clan' --- including the Roman families, the Tommy Lyons family, the Secretarys and the Prince of Wales family.
(2) The Batcho group of families --- including the Williams, the Qualls, Mary Raymond and family and Rona Ah Met and family.
(3) The Shepherd group of families, including the Reid family, the Risk family, the Baban family and the Shepherd family.
13 On 4 March 2004, the third applicants filed a written application for leave to discontinue their claim.
The basis for the application was said to be that 'significant members of the group had indicated that they were no longer willing to be members of the group'.
Following oral submissions and the consent of all of the other parties, I granted the application.
A Notice of Discontinuance was filed in the Northern Territory Registry that same day.
14 The third applicants' claimed areas of land and waters were also within those covered by applications filed on behalf of the first applicants.
All of the evidence led by the third applicants therefore remains relevant to the current proceedings.
Description of Claim Area 
 
15 The claim area in the consolidated proceedings covers parts of metropolitan Darwin and its surrounds on the Darwin Peninsula.
Darwin is the capital city of the Northern Territory, with a population of about 100,000 people.
It is a beautiful and vibrant city with a diverse population.
The Darwin region is on the coast, and consequently enjoys both beaches, around which development is mainly centred, and mangrove swamp areas, which according to archaeological evidence have developed over the last 500-1000 years.
16 Port Darwin is a protected harbour accessed from the north.
It is surrounded on the east by the Darwin Peninsula and on the west by the Cox Peninsula.
The claim area is that on the eastern side of Port Darwin extending eastwards and southwards.
The East Arm of the harbour joins up with the Elizabeth River which enters Port Darwin from the east.
The East Arm and the Middle Arm of the harbour are straddled by a wedge of land bounded by the East Arm and the Elizabeth River on its northern side and by the Middle Arm and then (to the east) Haycock Reach and Blackmore River (to the south east).
The western extremity of that wedge of land into Port Darwin is called Middle Point.
To the south of Middle Point in the entrance to the Middle Arm is Channel Island.
17 The claim area comprises many sections of land and waters, including mangrove swamps, within that general area.
It is overall an area of about 30 kilometres square.
The claim area does not encompass all that area, but generally those parts of the land where there has not been residential or commercial development.
The claim area encompasses mostly areas of Crown land as well as some land held by the Darwin City Council (DCC), and some land held by the Palmerston City Council, and includes waters adjoining areas of the land and mangrove swamps over which a claim has been made.
18 The central business district of Darwin is situated with Lameroo Beach on its south-west side, facing towards the Cox Peninsula.
The coastal suburbs of Darwin feature prominently in the claim area in this proceeding.
Cullen Bay, an inner-city suburb, is north of the CBD, as are Myilly Point, Mindil Beach, Vesteys Beach and Fannie Bay.
Further north, still on the coast, are the suburbs of Coconut Grove, Ludmilla, Casuarina Beach and Lee Point.
19 Stuart Park, another inner-city suburb, is situated to the north-east of the city, next to Dinah Beach, extending out into Frances Bay (before the East Arm begins).
A large area of mangroves runs from the edge of Stuart Park around the harbour and along the Elizabeth River, bordered by suburbs such as Winnellie, Coonawarra and Berrimah.
20 To the north-east of Darwin lies the suburb of Leanyer.
Leanyer, along with Holmes Jungle Nature Park and areas to its south-east, at the base of the Shoal Bay Peninsula and Howard Peninsula, including Howard Springs Nature Reserve, is within the broader claim area, so that parts of that area are within the claim area.
21 Palmerston, a town to the south of Darwin, also has areas to its south, south east and south west which are the subject of the claim.
22 It is helpful to note at this point that Justice Gray as the Aboriginal Land Rights Commissioner under the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976 (Cth) (the ALR Act) provided a Report and recommendations concerning a claim under the ALR Act entitled The Kenbi (Cox Peninsula) Land Claim No 37 on 12 December 2000 (the Kenbi Report).
I shall call the claim the subject of the Kenbi Report 'the Kenbi Claim'.
It concerned a claim under the ALR Act in respect of much of the Cox Peninsula, that area of land on the western side of Port Darwin, and extending at its southern section to the east to the western side of the Middle Arm of Port Darwin, as well as significant areas including islands west and south of the Cox Peninsula.
The stretch of water in Port Darwin known as the West Arm extending into part of the Cox Peninsula was surrounded by land encompassed within the Kenbi Claim.
23 This is only a brief overview.
It is clear that any examination of the area the subject of the native title determination applications in the consolidated proceeding will be complex and intricate.
24 Despite the fact that the claim area is a large area, extending over some residential areas and areas adjacent to residential areas, parks, swamps and beaches, the parties in their submissions said that all evidence in respect of the claim, although sometimes site specific, was relevant to the whole claim area.
They did not contend that findings should be made with respect to a particular claim area.
It was presented to the Court as an all or nothing scenario.
25 Because of this, it is not necessary at this point to consider whether claimed native title rights are applicable to particular sites.
It will be necessary to be more 'site specific' when addressing issues of extinguishment.
The Determination Sought 
 
26 Ultimately, the form of determination sought by the first applicants was in the following terms:
 Existence of native title (s.225) 
 
 1.
The Determination Area is the land and waters described in Schedule 1.

 
 2.
Native title exists in those parts of the Determination Area identified in Schedules 4 to 8 ( Native Title Area ).

 3.
Native Title does not exist in those parts of the Determination Area identified in Schedule 3.

 The Native Title Holders (s.225(a)) 
 4.
The native title is held by the Larrakia People.

 
 The nature and extent of native title rights and interests (s.225(b)) and exclusiveness of native title (s.225(e)) 
 
 5.
The native title rights and interests that exist in relation to each part of the Native Title Area referred to in Schedule 4 (being areas where there has been no extinguishment of native title or areas where any extinguishment must be disregarded) are a right of possession, occupation use and enjoyment to the exclusion of all others.

 6.
The native title rights and interests that exist in relation to each part of the Native Title Area referred to in Schedule 5 (being current and historical [e.g.
reserve, annual pastoral lease and pastoral lease areas where there is no public access] other than areas where any extinguishment must be disregarded) are:

 (k) rights of senior Aboriginal persons who, in accordance with the traditional laws acknowledged and traditional customs observed by the Larrakia people, are recognised as being authoritative in ritual or Larrakia knowledge: to act, in accordance with traditional laws and customs, in relation to the maintenance and protection of sites and rights of access to, and to hunt fish and gather the natural resources on Larrakia country subject to the permission, implied or express, of Larrakia people.

 
 
 7.
The native title rights and interests that exist in relation to each part of the Native Title Area referred to in Schedule 6 (being current and historical [where partial extinguishment acts involving greater loss of control of access have occurred --- e.g.
reserves where there is public access] other than areas where any extinguishment must be disregarded) are: 
 (a) right to enter or have access; 
 (b) right to remain; 
 (c) right to use and enjoy;

 8.
The native title rights and interests that exist in relation to each part of the Native Title Area referred to in Schedule 7 (being areas below high water mark) are: 
 (a) enter or have access; 
 (b) remain; 
 (c) use and enjoy; 
 (d) use and enjoy, or take, resources; 
 (e) share, exchange or trade resources; 
 (f) protect places of importance;

 9.
The rights referred to in Orders 6 --- 8 do not confer possession, occupation, use and enjoyment of that land and waters on the native title holders to the exclusion of all others.

 10.
The native title rights and interests are subject to and exercisable in accordance with the laws of the Northern Territory and the Commonwealth.

 11.
Notwithstanding anything in the determination, there are no native title rights and interests in or in relation to: 
 
 
 (a) such minerals as defined in the Mining Act (NT), as in force at the date of the determination, as are wholly owned by the Crown; or 
 (b) such petroleum as defined in the Petroleum Act (NT), as in force at the date of the determination, as is wholly owned by the Crown.

 
 
 12.
There are no exclusive native title rights in or to flowing or subterranean water in the Native Title Area.

 The nature and extent of any other interests in relation to the 
 Determination Area (s.225(c)) 
 
 13 .
The nature and extent of other interests in relation to the Native Title Area are the following as they exist at the date of the Determination: 
 (a) the public right to fish in tidal waters; 
 (b) the public right to navigate in tidal waters; 
 
 
 (c) so far as confirmed pursuant to section 13 of the Validation (Native Title) Act 1994 as at 18 June 1999, public access to and enjoyment of the following places: 
 
 
 (i) waterways; 
 
 
 (ii) beds and banks or foreshores of waterways; 
 
 
 
 
 (iii) coastal waters; 
 (iv) beaches 
 (v) areas that were public places at the end of 31 December 1993; 
 
 
 
 
 (d) the interests of [identified] persons to whom [identified] valid and validated rights and interests have been granted by the Crown pursuant to statute or otherwise in the exercise of its executive power; 
 (e) the right to access land by an employee or agent or instrumentality of the State, Commonwealth or any local government or other statutory authority as required in the performance of his or her statutory or common law duties where such access would be permitted to private land; 
 
 
 (f) the interests of Telstra Corporation Limited, being: 
 
 
 
 (i) rights and interests as the owner or operator of telecommunications facilities within the Native Title Area, including customer radio terminals and overhead and underground cabling; 
 (ii) rights and interests pursuant to the Post and Telegraph Act 1901 (Cth), the Telecommunications Act 1975 (Cth), the Australian Telecommunications Corporation Act 1991 (Cth) and the Telecommunications Act 1997 (Cth); and 
 (iii) rights of access by employees, agents or contractors of Telstra Corporation Limited to its facilities in or surrounded by the Native Title Area in the performance of their duties; and 
 
 
 
 
 (g) the interests of the Crown in any capacity, or of any statutory authority in relation to things referred to in Schedule 8 [public works and other facilities on Native Title Areas where any extinguishment is to be disregarded] which were constructed or commenced to be constructed or used on identified areas; 
 (h) the interests of the Crown in any capacity, or of any statutory authority in relation to things referred to in Schedule 9 [public works and other facilities on Native Title Areas where any extinguishment is not to be disregarded] which were constructed or commenced to be constructed or used on identified areas.

 
 Relationship between the Native Title Rights and Interests and 
 the Other Interests (s.225(d)) 

 
 14 .
The relationship between the native title rights and interests in the Native Title Area and the other rights and interests described in paragraph 13 ( other interests ) is that: 
 
 
 (a) in relation to the other interests referred to in paragraph 13 (insert sub-paragraphs identifying other interests to which section 23G and 44H of the Native Title Act apply, for example sub-paragraph (d), (e), (f) and (h)) --- the other interests, and the doing of any activity required or permitted to be done by or under the other interests, prevail over the native title rights and interests and any exercise of the native title rights and interests, but do not extinguish them, and the existence and exercise of the native title rights and interests does not prevent the doing of the activity; 
 (b) in relation to the other interests referred to in paragraph 13 (insert sub-paragraphs identifying other interests to which the non-extinguishment principal applies, for example sub-paragraphs (d), (g)) --- to the extent that the other interests are inconsistent with the continued existence, enjoyment or exercise of the native title rights and interests, the native title continues to exist in its entirety, but the native title rights and interests have no effect in relation to the other interests to the extent of the inconsistency during the currency of those other interests.
If those other interests are later removed or otherwise cease to operate, either wholly or partly, the native title rights and interests will again have full effect, wholly or partly as the case may be; 
 (c) in relation to the other interests referred to in paragraphs 13(a), (b) and (c) --- those rights co-exist with the native title rights and interests; and 
 (d) in relation to the other interests referred to in paragraph 13(g) --- the determination does not affect those interests.

 


 AND THE COURT FURTHER ORDERS THAT 
 How the Native Title is Held 
 
 15.
The native title is not to be held in trust.

 The Native Title Body Corporate 
 
 16.
Within three months of the date hereof, or such later period as may be allowed by the Court, the common law holders of native title may file a minute of a proposed determination under s56 and s 57 of the Native Title Act 1993 (Cth) and, if no such minute is filed within that time, it is determined that native title is held by the common law holders of native title.

 17.
Until such time as there is a registered native title body corporate in relation to the Native Title Area any notices required under the Native Title Act 1993 (Cth) or otherwise to be served on the Native Title Holders, the native title claim group or the registered native title claimant may be served upon the solicitors for the Applicants and the representative Aboriginal body for the Determination Area, and such service shall be deemed to be sufficient.


27 I have not reproduced the schedules referred to.
If I were to be satisfied that a determination of the existence of native title rights and interests should be made, either in the form sought or in some other form, the schedules would require separate consideration in the light of my findings about extinguishment.
28 The second applicants, of course, disagree with par 4 of that proposed determination.
They seek a determination in favour of the Danggalaba people.
29 It can be seen that the proposed determination includes a claim to exclusive possession of parts of the claim area.
At the other end of the spectrum, the Territory throughout maintained that the applicants had not established the existence of any native title rights and interests in the claim area under the NT Act.
The respondents alternatively contended that if any native title rights and interests were established, they were in no instance exclusive and they were not as extensive as those sought in the proposed determination.
They further contended that any such native title rights and interests as might otherwise have been established had, in essence, been extinguished by a combination of past legislative and executive actions.
30 The respective positions of the parties could hardly have been more diametrically opposed, save for the realistic acknowledgments the applicants made in respect of the extinguishing effect of a number of those past legislative and executive actions.
THE HEARING 
 
31 The hearing commenced on 2 September 2002 in Darwin.
Thereafter, 68 days of evidence and submissions were heard in several tranches.
The evidence of Aboriginal witnesses was given at the Supreme Court in Darwin and at other places in the claim area.
The Court received evidence from Aboriginal witnesses generally in the form of a written statement supplemented by oral evidence.
32 Evidence was taken at a number of sites in the claim area over eight days of evidence.
Part of the on-country evidence was on board a boat in Port Darwin, in the East Arm and Elizabeth River areas.
Evidence was also given on land within the claim area, at various places including the Esplanade area and Lameroo Beach (both on the south western side of the CBD); the Larrakeyah Barracks a little to the north of those points west; and Mindil Beach; East Point at the northern end of Fannie Bay; Kulaluk to the north of East Point; Rapid Creek; Casuarina Beach; Lee Point and Holmes Jungle (south-east of Lee Point).
On site evidence was also taken at the base of Howards Peninsula at Howard Swamp and Howard Springs near the eastern extremity of the claim area.
In the area to the east of the Darwin CBD and near the northern side of Port Darwin, further evidence was given at One Mile Dam (near Dinah Beach in Frances Bay), the Police Paddock, and east in Charles Darwin National Park.
Finally (for the purpose of this description, but not in the sequence of the evidence), on-site evidence was heard at Wickham Point and at the Channel Island Conservation Park, in the mouth of the Middle Arm of Port Darwin.
The sites where such evidence was taken therefore reflect a geographical spread around the claim area.
33 Oral evidence was given by some 47 Aboriginal persons about their personal history and experiences, what they had learned and knew of the claim area or parts of it, their upbringing, and their activities and dealings with and in the claim area, as well as their beliefs with respect to it.
That evidence was given in the courtroom, as well as 'on-country'.
Two statements were tendered of witnesses who were not presented for oral evidence.
Those two witnesses were Mr Quall and his sister Dianne (Didi) Quall.
34 Mr Quall also participated in the hearing by giving evidence, tendering certain documents and by cross-examining witnesses and presenting final submissions.
He sought to establish through his cross-examination that the Danggalaba Clan or the Kulumbiringin clan was the holder of native title rights and interests over such parts of the claim area as were the subject of claims by the Quall applications, rather than the larger Larrakia claim group.
As noted earlier, those clan groups were comprised of eight named persons or the family groups of four named elders.
His final written submissions confined the clan group to members of the Batcho family.
Certain of the named elders gave evidence in the course of the first applicants' case.
It is clear that the first applicants regard the second applicants (however comprised) as members of the Larrakia group, and certain of them clearly regarded Mr Quall as a person of seniority and significant learning.
35 Until the discontinuance of the Roman application, the Roman applicants were represented by leave by Jack Crosby and then by Steven McLean.
They tendered certain documents.
It was apparent from their cross-examination that they, too, regarded a more confined group than the Larrakia applicants as the persons entitled to hold native title rights and interests in the claim area generally, although their questioning was mainly directed to that part of the claim area covered by the Roman application.
36 Apart from that on-site evidence, the bulk of the evidence comprises expert reports, public records and witness statements tendered without formal proof.
The first applicants' expert reports included an archaeological report prepared by Dr Peter Hiscock (Dr Hiscock), a genealogical report prepared by Dr Michael Walsh (Dr Walsh), a linguistic report prepared by Dr Black, an historical report prepared by Dr Samantha Wells (Dr Wells), an ethno-archaeological report by Dr Patricia Bourke (Dr Bourke), and two anthropological reports by Mr Robert Graham (Mr Graham).
All of these witnesses were cross-examined, with the exception of Dr Hiscock.
Both Dr Walsh and Mr Graham had given evidence in the hearing of the Kenbi Claim, and they were questioned about that evidence and about documents they had produced for the purposes of that claim.
37 The material tendered on behalf of one or other of the applicants included the Kenbi Report, extensive sections of the transcript of the hearing before Justice Gray for the Kenbi Claim, the Kenbi Land Claim 1979 Book, sections of the book Saltwater People: Larrakia Stories from Around Darwin (Larrakia Nation Aboriginal Corporation, Casuarina, NT, 2001) and Larrakia Genealogies (used in the Kenbi Claim).
There was also extensive other documentary and photographic material.
38 The Territory tendered an historical report prepared by Ms Helen Wilson (Ms Wilson) and an anthropology report by the late Professor Kenneth Maddock (Professor Maddock).
Unfortunately, Professor Maddock died before the hearing of expert evidence.
The applicants later tendered an anthropology report of Professor Howard Morphy (Professor Morphy).
On 24 October 2003, I ruled that Professor Morphy's report be received, but limited to its use pursuant to s 136 of the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth) (the Evidence Act ) as being material which is available to the first applicants from a qualified anthropologist and which may have been used to cross-examine Professor Maddock were he available for cross-examination.
There was extensive documentary material filed in support of the report of Ms Wilson, as well as other material adduced by the respondents relevant to the asserted existence of native title in the claim area.
39 The Territory and the fifth respondent, the DCC also filed extensive documentary material relating to issues of extinguishment of native title.
That material included extensive tenure documentation, and records of public works carried out over many decades.
That material was expanded upon and explained by 26 witnesses called on behalf of the Territory or the DCC, many of whom were cross-examined.
40 The Amateur Fishermen's Association of Northern Territory (AFANT) also participated in the hearing by cross examining witnesses and by making submissions.
41 There were a number of non-active respondents: the Palmerston City Council, ANZ Banking Corporation Ltd, Defence Housing Authority, Delfin Chase Pty Ltd, Diamond Leisure Pty Ltd, Fernbank Pty Ltd, NT Gas Distribution Pty Ltd, NT Gas Pty Ltd, Guiseppe Maugeri, CSR Limited, CSR Readymix (Australia) Pty Ltd, Conservation Land Corporation, Telstra Corporation Ltd, Northern Territory Christian Schools Association, and Darwin Model Flying Club.
Of those non-active respondents, written closing submissions were submitted jointly by Defence Housing Authority, Delfin Chase Pty Ltd and ANZ Banking Group Ltd; jointly by NT Gas Pty Ltd and NT Gas Distribution Pty Ltd; by Mr Maugeri (through Motoo Sakurai); and by Telstra Corporation Ltd.
 
42 During the course of the hearing, I made certain orders restricting the publication of the transcript of gender restricted evidence.
The 'men only' evidence was to be transcribed by a man and access to the transcript was to be by men only.
The transcript was duly marked and kept separate from the general transcript.
Such evidence was given at the Larrakeyah Barracks and on three separate occasions in Court.
43 It is important to remark upon the conduct of the hearing by all parties and their legal representatives.
They are all to be commended.
As is clear from the above, the evidence was very extensive, particularly the documentary evidence.
All parties and their legal representatives at all times sought to maintain a clear focus on the issues to be decided in the case.
They appropriately co-operated in the timetabling of witnesses, and in ensuring that the Court could readily follow the proposed course of the evidence and the relevance of evidence to particular issues.
The final written submissions of all parties were comprehensive and focused.
Without those very helpful submissions, my task would have been much more difficult.
I am very appreciative of that assistance.
All parties should also be appreciative of the thorough and careful work done on their behalf by their legal representatives to ensure their respective cases were fully and properly presented, and the contentions in support of them effectively put.
THE LAW IN RELATION TO NATIVE TITLE 
 
44 The starting point for consideration of the consolidated proceeding is the NT Act.
True though it may be that paragraphs (a) and (b) of s 223(1) are based on the judgment of Brennan J in Mabo v Queensland (No 2) [1992] HCA 23 ; (1992) 175 CLR 1, it is the provisions of the NT Act which the Court must address in any determination of native title.
See Western Australia v Ward [2002] HCA 28 ; (2002) 213 CLR 1 ( Ward ), at [16], [25] per Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne JJ; Members of the Yorta Yorta Aboriginal Community v Victoria [2002] HCA 58 ; (2002) 214 CLR 422 ( Yorta Yorta ), at [32] per Gleeson CJ, Gummow and Hayne JJ; and Commonwealth v Yarmirr [2001] HCA 56 ; (2001) 208 CLR 1 ( Yarmirr ), at [7] per Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne JJ.
45 It is nevertheless appropriate to note that the NT Act is premised upon the fact that, on the acquisition of sovereignty, certain rights and interests held by indigenous people under their traditional laws and customs may be recognised by, and become enforceable under, the common law.
Until the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 (Cth), such rights were vulnerable to extinguishment, either total or partial, by a range of legislative and executive acts.
The NT Act provides for the circumstances in which, and the manner in which, the recognition of ongoing native title rights and interests may be determined.
It is therefore to the terms of the NT Act, as explained by the High Court, to which attention must be given.
46 Section 223(1) defines the term 'native title' as follows:
 
 '223(1) The expression native title or native title rights and interests means the communal, group or individual rights and interests of Aboriginal peoples or Torres Strait Islanders in relation to land or waters, where: 
 
 (a) the rights and interests are possessed under the traditional laws acknowledged, and the traditional customs observed, by the Aboriginal peoples or Torres Strait Islanders; and 
 (b) the Aboriginal peoples or Torres Strait Islanders, by those laws and customs, have a connection with the land or waters; and 
 (c) the rights and interests are recognised by the common law of Australia.
' 

47 What is to be determined upon a determination of native title is provided for in s 225 of the NT Act: 
 
 'A determination of native title is a determination whether or not native title exists in relation to a particular area (the determination area ) of land or waters, and if it does exist, a determination of: 
 
 (a) who the persons, or each group of persons, holding the common or group rights comprising the native title are; and 
 (b) the nature and extent of the native title rights and interests in relation to the determination area; and 
 (c) the nature and extent of any other interests in relation to the determination area; and 
 (d) the relationship between the rights and interests in paragraphs (b) and (c) (taking into account the effect of this Act); and 
 (e) to the extent that the land or waters in the determination area are not covered by a non-exclusive agricultural lease or a non-exclusive pastoral lease --- whether the native title rights and interests confer possession, occupation, use and enjoyment of that land or waters on the native title holders to the exclusion of all others.
' 

48 All the elements of the definition of native title in s 223(1) must be given effect: Yorta Yorta at [33].
In Ward at [17]-[18], Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne JJ said in relation to s 223(1):
 
 'Several points should be made here.
First, the rights and interests may be communal, group or individual rights and interests.
Secondly, the rights and interests consist "in relation to land or waters".
Thirdly, the rights and interests must have three characteristics: they are rights and interests which are "possessed under the traditional laws acknowledged, and the traditional customs observed", by the relevant peoples; by those traditional laws and customs, the peoples "have a connection with" the land or waters in question; and the rights and interests must be "recognised by the common law of Australia".


49 The High Court reiterated those matters in Yarmirr at [9] per Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne JJ and also in Yorta Yorta at [33]-[35] per Gleeson CJ, Gummow and Hayne JJ.
50 In Ward , the same members of the High Court addressed the issues for consideration in a determination of native title.
In relation to s 223(1)(a), their Honours said (at [18]):
 
 'The question in a given case whether (a) is satisfied presents a question of fact.
It requires not only the identification of the laws and customs said to be traditional laws and customs, but, no less importantly, the identification of the rights and interests in relation to land or waters which are possessed under those laws or customs.
These inquiries may well depend upon the same evidence as is used to establish connection of the relevant peoples with the land or waters.
This is because the connection that is required by par (b) of s 223(1) is a connection with the land or waters "by those laws or customs".
Nevertheless, it is important to notice that there are two inquiries required by the statutory definition: in the one case for the rights and interests possessed under traditional laws and customs and, in the other, for connection with land or waters by those laws and customs.
' 

51 In relation to s 223(1)(b), they said (at [64]):
 
 'In its terms, s 223(1)(b) is not directed to how Aboriginal peoples use or occupy land or waters.
Section 223(1)(b) requires consideration of whether, by the traditional laws acknowledged and the traditional customs observed by the peoples concerned, they have a "connection" with the land or waters.
That is, it requires first an identification of the content of traditional laws and customs and, secondly, the characterisation of the effect of those laws and customs as constituting a "connection" of the peoples with the land or waters in question.
No doubt there may be cases where the way in which land or waters are used will reveal something about the kind of connection that exists under traditional law or custom between Aboriginal peoples and the land or waters concerned.
But the absence of evidence of some recent use of the land or waters does not, of itself, require the conclusion that there can be no relevant connection.
Whether there is a relevant connection depends, in the first instance, upon the content of traditional law and custom and, in the second, upon what is meant by "connection" by those laws and customs.
This latter question was not the subject of submissions in the present matters, the relevant contention being advanced in the absolute terms we have identified and without examination of the particular aspects of the relationship found below to have been sufficient.
We, therefore, need express no view, in these matters, on what is the nature of the "connection" that must be shown to exist.
In particular, we need express no view on when a "spiritual connection" with the land (an expression often used in the Western Australian submissions and apparently intended as meaning any form of asserted connection without evidence of continuing use or physical presence) will suffice.
' 

52 In Yorta Yorta , the High Court (Gleeson CJ, Gummow and Hayne JJ; Gaudron and Kirby JJ dissenting) further addressed the requirements of s 223(1) and expanded on the need for connection.
53 The majority set out the following principles at [37]: 
 
 'First, it follows from Mabo [No 2] that the Crown's acquisition of sovereignty over the several parts of Australia cannot be challenged in an Australian municipal court.
Secondly, upon acquisition of sovereignty over a particular part of Australia, the Crown acquired a radical title to the land in that part, but native title to that land survived the Crown's acquisition of sovereignty and radical title.
What survived were rights and interests in relation to land or waters.
Those rights and interests owed their origin to a normative system other than the legal system of the new sovereign power; they owed their origin to the traditional laws acknowledged and the traditional customs observed by the indigenous peoples concerned.
' 

54 At [38]-[40] and at [43]-[45], the majority stated that the rights and interests the subject of the NT Act are those which derive from traditional laws and customs forming a body of norms that existed before sovereignty.
This principle affects the construction of the definition of native title in s 223(1), in particular, the meaning of 'traditional'.
See Yorta Yorta at [46]-[47], where the majority said:
 
 ' ...the references, in pars (a) and (b) of the definition of native title, to "traditional" law or custom must be understood in the light of the considerations that have been mentioned.
As the claimants submitted, "traditional" is a word apt to refer to a means of transmission of law or custom.
A traditional law or custom is one which has been passed from generation to generation of a society, usually by word of mouth and common practice.
But in the context of the Native Title Act , "traditional" carries with it two other elements in its meaning.
First, it conveys an understanding of the age of the traditions: the origins of the content of the law or custom concerned are to be found in the normative rules of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander societies that existed before the assertion of sovereignty by the British Crown.
It is only those normative rules that are "traditional" laws and customs.

 
 Secondly, and no less importantly, the reference to rights or interests in land or waters being possessed under traditional laws acknowledged and traditional customs observed by the peoples concerned, requires that the normative system under which the rights and interests are possessed (the traditional laws and customs) is a system that has had a continuous existence and vitality since sovereignty.
If that normative system has not existed throughout that period, the rights and interests which owe their existence to that system will have ceased to exist.
And any later attempt to revive adherence to the tenets of that former system cannot and will not reconstitute the traditional laws and customs out of which rights and interests must spring if they are to fall within the definition of native title.
' 

55 The majority judgment in Yorta Yorta imposes a requirement of continuity on both the Aboriginal society and also on the acknowledgment and observance of the traditional laws and customs which are claimed to give rise to the rights and interests under the NT Act: at [49]-[53].
56 Laws and customs do not exist in a vacuum --- they 'arise out of and, in important respects, go to define a particular society': Yorta Yorta at [49], [55].
In this context, 'society' is to be 'understood as a body of persons united in and by its acknowledgment and observance of a body of laws and customs': at [49].
If the society ceases to exist, then so too do its traditional laws and customs, from which rights and interests arise: at [50].
Once a society has ceased to exist, it is not possible for descendants of that society to take up again the 'traditional' laws and customs as those expressions are used in the NT Act: [51]-[52].
As the majority said in Yorta Yorta at [53]: 
 
 'When the society whose laws or customs existed at sovereignty ceases to exist, the rights and interests in land to which these laws and customs gave rise, cease to exist.
If the content of the former laws and customs is later adopted by some new society, those laws and customs will then owe their new life to that other, later, society and they are the laws acknowledged by, and customs observed by, that later society , they are not laws and customs which can now properly now be described as being the existing laws and customs of the earlier society.
The rights and interests in land to which the re-adopted laws and customs give rise are rights and interests which are not rooted in pre-sovereignty traditional law and custom but in the laws and customs of the new society.
' 
 
 
 See also Yorta Yorta at [55].


57 The requirement for continuity of connection is not absolute.
In Yorta Yorta , the majority recognised at [83] that
 
 '...demonstrating some change to, or adaptation of, traditional law or custom or some interruption of enjoyment or exercise of native title rights or interests in the period between the Crown asserting sovereignty and the present will not necessarily be fatal to a native title claim.
...
The key question is whether the law and custom can still be seen to be traditional law and traditional custom.
Is the change or adaptation of such a kind that it can no longer be said that the rights or interests asserted are possessed under the traditional laws acknowledged and the traditional customs observed by the relevant peoples when that expression is understood in the sense earlier identified?'.

 
 
 See also Yorta Yorta at [44] and [82]-[89].


58 The acknowledgement and observance of the traditional laws and customs must have continued 'substantially uninterrupted' since sovereignty: Yorta Yorta at [87].
59 The issues on the hearing have been hard fought.
Apart from facilitating the course of the evidence, the Territory and the other respondents have made no admissions.
They dispute each element of the matters the applicants or one or other of the first applicants or the second applicants must establish to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Court that, but for the extinguishing effect of any particular dealings with any parts of the claim area, they have or would have native title rights or interests in any part of the claim area.
60 Senior counsel for the DCC identified five steps in the respondents' opposition:
 
(1) that no native title rights and interests have been shown to exist in the claim area; or
(2) if such rights do exist, they are limited and non-exclusive rights only; and
 
 (3) the extent to which, if at all, s 47A and s 47B of the NT Act can apply in respect of any parts of the claim area;
 (4) in respect of those parts of the claim area to which s 47A or s 47B apply, what extinguishment of native title rights and interests should be disregarded by reason of their operation; and
 (5) in respect of those parts of the claim area where s 47A or s 47B of the NT Act do not apply, or if they do where extinguishment is not to be disregarded, the detailed consideration of the nature and effect of the myriad extinguishing acts relied upon by the respondents.


61 A further issue which emerged clearly only in the course of final submissions is whether the various applications comprising the consolidated proceeding were each properly authorised to be brought in the name of the several specified applicants in accordance with s 251B of the NT Act.
Section 61 requires a native title determination application to have been authorised by the native title claim group.
62 Before turning to s 61 of the NT Act, I note that there has been some change in the way in which the first applicants have expressed the nature of their claimed native title rights and interests from time to time.
The Territory in particular has complained of that, and submit that the first applicants should not be permitted to depart from their Points of Claim filed on 27 August 2002 without leave.
I do not discern that the change in the expressed claims has caused the respondents any unfairness.
The progress of the evidence revealed that the Points of Claim were not fully reflective of certain of the present traditional laws and customs of the first applicants (as some witnesses expressed them).
There is nothing to indicate that any of the respondents would have questioned a witness differently, or would have adduced any different or further evidence, if the Points of Claim had accorded entirely with the final submissions of the first applicants, or would have sought more time to investigate any of the claims or to take instructions before questioning any particular witness or witnesses.
If it were necessary to do so, I would in the circumstances give the first applicants leave to amend their Points of Claim.
For reasons which appear below, I do not need to address that aspect further.
AUTHORISATION UNDER s 61 OF THE NATIVE TITLE ACT 
 
63 Pursuant to s 81 of the NT Act, the Court has jurisdiction to hear and determine applications filed in the Court that relate to native title.
Section 61 of the NT Act provides for the applications that may be made to the Federal Court, and the persons who may make such applications.
64 Prior to the introduction of the Native Title Amendment Act 1998 (Cth) (the amending Act), s 61 provided that an application for determination of native title could be made by a 'person or persons claiming to hold the native title either alone or with others': s 61(1).
The application was required to be in the prescribed form and 'contain such information in relation to the matters sought to be determined as is prescribed.
' An application made by a person or persons claiming to hold native title with others was required to describe or otherwise identify those others.
However, it was not necessary to name the 'others' or say how many there were: s 61(3).
65 The amending Act repealed s 61 and replaced it.
The 'new' s 61 commenced on 30 September 1998, and provided that an application can be made by a 'person or persons authorised by all the persons (the native title claim group ) who, according to their traditional laws and customs, hold the common or group rights and interests comprising the particular native title claimed, provided the person or persons are also included in the native title claim group': s 61(1).
66 The application must name the persons in the native title group or otherwise describe the persons sufficiently clearly so that it can be ascertained whether any particular person is one of those persons: s 61(4).
67 The issue arises whether, where an application lodged before 30 September 1998 has been amended subsequent to the commencement of the amending Act, such an amended application must comply with the new s 61 requirements.
I note that of the applications made before the commencement of the amending Act, the application in DG6007/1998 is the only one which has not since been amended.
As the first applicants pointed out in their submissions in reply, all of the parts of the claim area covered by application DG6007/1998 are accepted by them as having been extinguished (Schedule 3 of their Revised Form of Determination), so it is not necessary to further address the question of whether that application needed to be, and was, authorised.
68 In Quall v Risk [2001] FCA 378 O'Loughlin J at [65] held that an application that is amended subsequent to the commencement of the amending Act must comply with the new requirements of s 61.
Quall v Risk has been followed in Dieri People v State of South Australia [2003] FCA 187 ; (2003) 127 FCR 364 ( Dieri ) at [18] and in Edward Landers v State of South Australia [2003] FCA 264 ; (2003) 128 FCR 495 at [5] .
This view is consistent with decisions requiring amendments for a native title determination application made after the amending Act to comply with the NT Act: Daniel for the Ngaluma People v Western Australia [1999] FCA 686 per Nicholson J; Eora People --- Brown v NSW Minister for Land and Water Conservation [2000] FCA 1238 at [22] per Madgwick J; Donnelly v Minister for Land and Water Conservation [1999] FCA 1581 at [11] per Hely J.
I observe that in Bodney v Bropho [2004] FCAFC 226 ; (2004) 140 FCR 77 at [20] Branson J said that those three last mentioned cases do not support the principle expressed in Quall v Risk .
The view in Quall v Risk is also consistent with s 66B of the NT Act, introduced by the amending Act.
That section provides for the replacement of applicants in native title determination applications, having regard to the authorisation prescribed by s 251B, whether or not the native title determination application was made before or after the amending Act: Daniel v Western Australia (2002) 194 ALR 278 ( Daniel v WA ); Holborow v State of Western Australia [2002] FCA 1428.
Section 251B requires the authorisation to be given by all the persons in a native title claim group in the manner provided for.
69 In Bodney v State of Western Australia [2003] FCA 890 ( Bodney ), before Wilcox J, the parties accepted the adoption of the approach in Quall v Risk .
The Full Court in Bodney v Bropho (2004) 149 FCR 77 did not find it necessary to determine this issue because the parties had accepted the approach in Quall v Risk : see the judgments of Spender J at [1], Branson J at [15] and Stone J at [55].
70 Emmett J in Wharton on behalf of the Kooma People v State of Queensland [2003] FCA 1398 ( Wharton ) considered O'Loughlin J's decision in Quall v Risk in the context of a notice of motion to strike out a native title determination application under s 84C of the NT Act.
His Honour drew attention to item 21 of Sch 5 to the amending Act which provided as follows:
 
 'Section 84C of the new Act applies where the main application mentioned in that section was made either before or after the commencement of that section.
If the main application was made before the commencement, the reference in that section to section 61 or section 62 is a reference to section 61 or section 62 of the old Act.
' 

71 Emmett J considered at [27-28] that 
 
 'An amendment to the main application does not give rise to a new application.
The scheme of the Act recognises that applications may be amended.
There is nothing to suggest that, when an application is amended, it should thereupon be treated as a new application so as to lose the protection afforded by item 21.

 
 Quite anomalous consequences could flow from the construction contended for by the Branfield Applicants.
Any amendment made, after the commencement of the Amendment Act, to a native title determination application filed prior to the commencement of the Amendment Act, would lead to the removal of the protection implicit in item 21'.


72 His Honour qualified his position by noting at [29] O'Loughlin J's referral to an amendment involving a change in the 'composition of the claimants', and suggested that 
 
 '[t]here may be some justification for treating as a fresh application, an application purporting to be made on behalf of a native title claim group different in substance from the group named pursuant to s 61(2) of the old Act'.

 
 
 In Bodney v Bropho [2004] FCAFC 226 ; (2004) 140 FCR 77 at [85] , Stone J referred to Emmett J's statement and said: 
 
 
 'In other words, for a change in composition of the claim group to justify treating the application as a fresh application made after the commencement of the Amending Act (with the consequence that it is required to comply with s 61 of the new Act), the change would need to be such that, in Emmett J's words, the claim group is 'different in substance' from the group originally named.
In my view, however, an amendment that provided further particulars of the claim group, as opposed to one that changed the composition of the claim group, would not justify departing from the clear words of cl 21 of Schedule 5.
' 

73 The decision in Wharton was the subject of an application for leave to appeal to the Full Court, which comprised Ryan, Finn and North JJ: Branfield v Wharton [2004] FCAFC 138.
The application was refused.
Their Honours were prepared to assume the existence of the principle said to be established by Quall v Risk for the purposes of the application.
However, at [12], their Honours found that the applicants had not established any error made by Emmett J in the application of the principle.
74 Before the Full Court in Wharton , the State of Queensland argued that Quall v Risk was wrongly decided, and that an application under s 84C of the NT Act in respect of an application for a determination of native title commenced before the amending Act was to be considered under the old s 61, whether or not there were amendments made to the application after the commencement of the amending Act.
The Full Court found that it was unnecessary to decide this point, and that '[c]onsideration of that argument should await a case in which its determination is required by the facts of the case': at [13].
75 On that state of the authorities, in my view I should follow the approach in Quall v Risk .
It is a decision of some years' standing, and has been followed in a number of subsequent single judge decisions.
Counsel for the first applicant did not contend that it is clearly wrong.
Consequently, the next step is to determine whether the requirements of the new s 61 were fulfilled in relation to the applications comprised in the consolidated proceedings.
76 As noted above, s 61 requires that a person who makes an application for a native title determination be 'authorised by all the persons (the native title claim group ) who, according to their traditional laws and customs, hold the common or group rights and interests comprising the particular native title claimed ...'.
"Authorised" is defined in s 251B as follows:
 
 'For the purposes of this Act, all the persons in a native title claim group or compensation claim group authorise a person or persons to make a native title determination application or a compensation application, and to deal with matters arising in relation to it, if: 
 
 (a) where there is a process of decision-making that, under the traditional laws and customs of the persons in the native title claim group or compensation claim group, must be complied with in relation to authorising things of that kind --- the persons in the native title claim group or compensation claim group authorise the person or persons to make the application and to deal with the matters in accordance with that process; or 
 (b) where there is no such process --- the persons in the native title claim group or compensation claim group authorise the other person or persons to make the application and to deal with the matters in accordance with a process of decision-making agreed to and adopted, by the persons in the native title claim group or compensation claim group, in relation to authorising the making of the application and dealing with the matters, or in relation to doing things of that kind.
' 


 
77 Section 251B provides for two mutually exclusive means for all the persons in the native title claim group to authorise one or more persons to make a native title determination application: Dieri at [57].
78 The requirement that 'all' persons of the group are to authorise the applicant to make the application does not mean that every single person must give their authorisation.
In Lawson v Minister for Land and Water Conservation (NSW) [2002] FCA 1517 at [25] , Stone J held that s 251B(a) and (b) provide the means by which 'all the persons in a native title claim' are taken to have given their authorisation.
Similarly, O'Loughlin J in Quall v Risk at [33] held that 'all' cannot mean every member of the group.
Further, there is no prescribed procedure in the NT Act by which each member of the group authorises an applicant to bring an application, indicating that as long as a decision-making process is adhered to as outlined in s 251B, the authorisation will be valid.
79 Seven native title determination applications were filed by the first applicants.
These include DG6007/98; DG6017/98; DG6040/98; D6001/99; D6007/99; D6018/99 and D6026/01.
All of these applications (apart from DG6007/98) were either amended or lodged subsequent to the commencement of the amending Act, on 30 September 1998.
Applications DG6017/98 and DG6040/98 were filed before 30 September 1998.
These applications were amended subsequent to the amendments to the NT Act, for the purposes of the registration test.
The Authorisation Process 
 
80 Mr Risk gave evidence in relation to the authorisation of the Larrakia applicants in the proceedings.
His evidence was to the effect that two procedures were used to obtain authorisation from all members of the Larrakia group to go ahead with the native title determination application.
81 The first procedure was a series of 'public meetings', held at numerous locations.
The numbers of attendees at these meetings varied.
The Northern Land Council organised the meetings and notified people by sending out individually addressed letters to participants.
Mr Risk gave evidence that the Northern Land Council maintained a list of all of the applicants.
This list was compiled with the help of the individual families and anthropologists who worked with the Northern Land Council and was updated at the meetings where any new attendees were noted.
However, Mr Risk could not say from his own knowledge that the Northern Land Council wrote a letter to each person on the list.
82 Mr Risk gave evidence that the public meetings were 'mainly information type meetings.
The decision to be party to the Native Title application came from the family groupings'.
He further explained:
 
 'Each of the families who are party to the application come from large groups of families.
They in turn have elders that they listen to in their individual family groupings.
If those families were not to be party to the application they would have made that decision based on their beliefs and values in their families from their elders, and they would have instructed myself and the Northern Land Council not to have them on there, so ... each of those families who are party to the application made a decision within their family units listening to their relatives and coming along and being party to it.
' 

83 There were also individual meetings between Mr Risk, sometimes accompanied by a representative of the Northern Land Council, and the families that were considered to make up the Larrakia group.
During these meetings, there would be discussion of bringing a native title determination application.
When questioned during the proceedings, Mr Risk was satisfied that all members of each family were notified of each meeting and were able to attend.
84 During the hearing, I asked Mr Risk about what would happen if some of the family groups did not want to go ahead with the application, as occurred here with the Roman and the Quall families.
He responded that there would be further discussions.
If the families still refused to participate, then the decision of the majority would bind all of the families.
He had learned this principle from observance of 'what has happened since the [19]70's and the processes that have been followed'.
He was not able to say whether this was a traditional decision-making process which would have applied in the late 1800's onwards.
85 In summary, Mr Risk was confident, on his understanding of the Larrakia laws and customs, that, having consulted with the families, and having agreement from almost all of the families to go ahead with the application, he was authorised to bring the native title claim on behalf of the Larrakia group, which included the Qualls and the Romans.
86 There was no substantive evidence given by Mr Quall as to how the Quall applications came to be authorised.
Section 251B(a): decision-making under traditional laws and customs 
 
87 The requirements of s 251B(a) are met in relation to a native title determination application only in circumstances where there are traditional laws or customs which deal with authorising 'things of that kind'.
An analogy may need to be drawn, given that traditional laws and customs are unlikely to have contemplated a process for authorising native title claims: Daniel v WA .
88 The requirement for authorisation acknowledges 'the communal character of traditional law and custom which grounds native title.
It is not a condition to be met by formulaic statements in or in support of applications': Strickland v Native Title Registrar (1999) 168 ALR 242 at 259-260, approved by the Full Court in Western Australia v Strickland [2000] FCA 652 ; (2000) 99 FCR 33 at 52 and cited in Daniel v WA at [12].
89 There must be evidence as to the nature of the decision-making process employed: Quandamooka People (No 1) v State of Queensland [2002] FCA 259 at [25] , where Drummond J referred to 'the importance of there being evidence identifying the nature of the decision-making processes followed by a native title claim group that result in one or more of their members being given authority to act in relation to the claim on behalf of the group.
' See also Duren v Kiama Council [2001] FCA 1363 , per Lindgren J at [6].
90 In Daniel v WA , two groups of Aboriginal people had had a close association over the preceding fifty years.
In relation to the native title determination application, the applicants had held a number of community meetings, where there was discussion and consultation between group members.
Evidence was led that this process had been followed since the claim was lodged in 1996.
French J found that 
 
 'the evidence ... suggests that they have developed no form of common or joint decision-making applicable to native title determination applications which could be called decision-making under traditional law and custom.
It may well be that within each group there are internal mechanisms of traditional law and custom which inform the process of joint decision-making in relation to matters connected with the native title determination application.
But, in my opinion there is on the balance of probability no process of the kind contemplated in s 251B(a) of the Native Title Act .
' (at [51]) 

91 In contrast, in Dieri , there was evidence that there had been held traditional tribal meetings, attended by the initiated and elders, at each stage of the proceedings.
This was sufficient to indicate that the decisions were made pursuant to traditional laws and customs (at [52]).
92 The issue of authorisation in the current proceedings was not pleaded by the applicants nor by the respondents.
It is therefore not surprising that so little evidence was led in relation to this evidence.
Indeed, the only evidence led was that of Mr Risk.
93 The issue emerged in essence during final submissions.
It was thoroughly canvassed in the Territory's written submissions.
There was no attempt by counsel for the first applicants to bring the authorisation within s 251B(b) of the Act, doubtless because Mr Risk's evidence excluded this option.
Counsel for the first applicants submitted that the decision-making process, whereby discussion would occur between family groups with the ultimate decision made by the elders, was traditional.
94 It would be appropriate to defer ruling on this issue until findings are made about the existence of traditional laws and customs of a society which existed at sovereignty, and which has continued to maintain those traditional laws and customs (albeit adapted to the changes in society generally) to the present time.
The determination of those matters is likely to expose the answer to the competing submissions on this point.
In the event, it has become unnecessary to further address this issue.
CONSIDERATION OF THE EVIDENCE 
 
95 In the following extensive section of these reasons, I propose to consider the evidence in the several historical periods suggested by the Territory.
That is not inconsistent with the approach of the applicants, although their written submission was structured in a somewhat different way.
I think the process is the more convenient way of ensuring the proper application of s 223 of the NT Act.
96 In this section of my reasons for judgment I have adopted the course of referring to the 'Larrakia people' as encompassing both the first applicants and the second applicants.
That avoids the duplication of references, and reflects the fact that most of the evidence on connection was adduced by the first applicants.
It is not intended to reflect any prejudgment of the respective claims of the first applicants and of the second applicants.
Where it is necessary to distinguish between them, I have done so.
97 The evidence is to be considered having regard to the matters which the applicants are required to establish to make out their claim or claims, and which the Territory disputes.
They are:
 
 (a) whether the applicants are a society united in and by its acknowledgment and observance of a body of laws and customs which constitutes a normative system, or as the Territory contends, the 'laws and customs' asserted are idiosyncratic and inconsistent both between and within family groups, with the result that it is not possible to infer any commonality or unity within the group about those 'laws and customs';
 (b) whether the present day body of laws and customs are the body of laws and customs acknowledged and observed by the ancestors of members of the Larrakia people, or as the Territory contends, the differences between the laws and customs disclosed in the historical material and the present day evidence are significant and substantial; and
 (c) whether the acknowledgment and observance of the laws and customs has continued substantially uninterrupted by each generation since sovereignty, and whether the society has continued to exist throughout that period as a body united in and by its acknowledgment and observance of those laws and customs, or as the Territory contends, from very soon after non-Aboriginal settlement of the Darwin area, the Larrakia 'society' ceased to acknowledge and to observe the laws and customs previously acknowledged and observed, until the 'land rights era' of the 1970s when a revival of an approximation of those laws and customs gave rise to the present day Larrakia society.



 The Period 1825 --- c 1910 
 
98 The first step in determining whether the Larrakia people have maintained a continuous connection with the claim area is to demonstrate whether, at the time of sovereignty, the Larrakia people existed in the Darwin region and had a body of traditional laws and customs which the group acknowledged and observed.
In my discussion of whether the Larrakia people have maintained a sufficient 'connection', it is necessary to quote certain historical sources at length.
Much of the descriptive language included in such sources is now considered inappropriate and offensive.
99 It is agreed between the parties that the Crown acquired sovereignty over the Northern Territory in 1825, and that the first European settlement in the Darwin region was in 1869.
The date of sovereignty results from the extension of the boundary of the Colony of New South Wales to the meridian of 129 o east longitude from the meridian of 135 o east longitude by Letters Patent issued to Governor Darling and dated 16 July 1825: see the discussion in Hayes v Northern Territory [1999] FCA 1248 ; (1999) 97 FCR 32 at 68 per Olney J.
100 In the First Applicants' Amended Points of Claim, filed 27 August 2002, the first applicants plead the following:
 
 ' Prior inhabitants 
 
 
 96.
Aboriginal people ( prior inhabitants ) have inhabited the Larrakia country including the claim area since before non-indigenous sovereignty was asserted over, and long before non-indigenous settlement first occurred in, Larrakia country.

 
 
 
 
 
 97.
The following facts and matters are relied on to establish such prior inhabitancy: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (a) archaeological material at least 3,000 years old, and perhaps as much as 7,000 years old, is known from the region of the claim area and Larrakia country.
Many different types of sites are known, with artefact scatters and middens being the most common.
Many thousands of sites exist within Larrakia country.
These sites are found throughout the region but are concentrated on coastal and riverine zones.
The archaeological material shows that during the last few thousand years the foraging economy of the occupants of Larrakia country changed as people exploited marine molluscs less intensively and switched focus of their food gathering in wetland areas.
The archaeological material is consistent with Aboriginal occupation of the area by a single group that changed its economic practices throughout the 3,000 years recorded and developed into the Larrakia as observed historically.
Ethnographic and historical observations are largely congruent with the kinds of archaeological patterns that have been documented.
The targeting of resources and the focus of occupation, between prehistoric and historic periods suggests continuity of lifestyle; 
 (b) a survey of the historical attestations of the Larrakia language and a review of the phonology, grammar and vocabulary of Larrakia language in order to explore the historical relations between Larrakia and other languages leads to the conclusion that Larrakia is likely to have developed over a number of millennia in its most recent location; 
 (c) the Darwin area was occupied by an Aboriginal people in organised society in 1825 and in 1869; 
 (d) the first recorded interactions between Aboriginal people and Europeans in the immediate Darwin area was made in 1839, some 14 years after the inclusion of the Northern Territory in the colony of New South Wales involved, on the part of Europeans, John Lort Stokes.
Attestations by Stokes of the language of the Aboriginal people he met are more similar to Larrakia than to any other known language of the area.
Permanent European occupation of the Darwin area did not occur until 1869.
Prior to this there was very little European activity in the Darwin area.
The historical record created between 1989 [sic] and 1940 consistently recognises Larrakia people as belonging to the Darwin region because of their prior occupation of that area.
The historical record demonstrates that from 1869 non-Aboriginal people continued to recognise Larrakia rights in the Darwin area.
Between 1869 and 1940 and to the present day the historical record contains references to Larrakia assertions of traditional rights within the Darwin area; 
 (e) the historical record, the genealogical record, and the oral history of the Larrakia attest to the ancestral connection between the members of the Larrakia claim group and the Aboriginal people in occupation of the claim area in 1825; and 
 (f) the traditional connection of the Larrakia with the claim area, and the native title rights and interests they assert, were inherited from their ancestors in accordance with traditional laws and customs.
' 
 
 
 Archaeological Evidence 
 
101 Archaeological evidence was provided by Dr Hiscock, a Senior Lecturer and Head of Archaeology at the Australian National University in Canberra.
102 Dr Hiscock identified numerous types of archaeological sites in the Darwin region, and noted that it is currently impossible to determine an accurate estimate of overall site density in the area because of insufficient data.
Despite this, he concluded that archaeological material at least 3000 years old is known from the Darwin region.
From the available evidence, Dr Hiscock was able to conclude:
 
 'Firstly, the archaeological record indicates all the major aspects of the economic structures that were in place.
The shells and bones found in shell middens, earth mounds and non-midden deposits reflect food preparation, consumption and discard, and by implication the foraging that obtained the food.
In those same sites stone artefacts ... are the sole surviving component of what must have been a more diverse material tool kit for exploiting the landscape.
The artefacts include stone axes, points, and various forms that could have been used for cutting and scraping.
These stone artefacts have been obtained from quarries, either directly by the use or through trade.
The artefacts were manufactured, often in one locality before transportation to a second locality for use.

 
 These economic activities were clearly structured across the landscape.
Exploitation of food resources and perhaps long-term encampment was most intense in the river valleys and wetlands and along the coast ... .
Within these zones activities were structured, as revealed by site location and clustering.
The details of structuring are not always clear given the available level of archaeological information, but the structuring was presumably in response to economic and social needs.
Away from the resource rich locations, such as in the low hills and laterite plains, occupation may have [been] less intensive and more specific, as revealed in the exploitation of quarries for material used elsewhere.

 
 The second point that can be made is that the archaeological investigations have revealed changes in the economy of people living in the area.
On the Adelaide River flood plain there is evidence to show that as the plain formed it eliminated rich mangrove habitats and eventually created the freshwater wetlands visible today.
During this sequence of environmental change the animals targeted for food changed ... .
Equally dramatic changes are visible in archaeological sites on the coast, where shell mounds are up to 2,500 years old ... .
These mounds are composed largely of Anadara shells, a mollusc that lives mainly on open beaches.
The extensive mangrove communities that exist in the Darwin Harbour have built up in the last 500-1,000 years.
Prior to that time the archaeological record, in the form of shell mounds, provides evidence for intensive exploitation of shell beds on the open coastline ... .
In the last few hundred years the development of the mangroves is connected to the reduction of intensive mollusc exploitation and mound building as people shifted emphasis to other resources.
Future archaeological investigations will provide more details of these events, but it is already clear that economic restructuring occurred during the last few thousand years.
' 

103 In essence, Dr Hiscock found that, on the basis of the available archaeological evidence, the Darwin region has been inhabited for at least the past 3000 years by a group of people with established economic structures that could adapt to, for example, environmental change.
Dr Hiscock's evidence was not contested by the respondent.
I accept his evidence.
104 Dr Hiscock pointed out that the archaeological record can only yield information stored in material objects, and then only objects which are capable of preservation.
He also pointed out the relative chronological imprecision of archaeological investigation compared to historical records.
Whilst I accept those limitations upon his evidence, I think it points firmly towards there having been in the general geographical area of the claim area a diversity of activities consistent with a population of some density indicative of a 'resident' population, albeit (as he said) somewhat unevenly spread and probably influenced by geographic and environmental factors.
I also accept his evidence that the economic society to which his findings point existed a considerable time before sovereignty and adapted and modified in response to environmental change with the passage of time.
105 The Territory pointed out that the archaeological record did not reveal the practice of capture and consumption of dugong and marine turtle, so that that practice (to which a number of witnesses referred, as well as it being disclosed in the historical data) must have arisen in the relatively recent past.
Consistent with Dr Hiscock's view, that recent past may have been pre-sovereignty.
106 Overall, his evidence does point to an organised society existing pre-sovereignty in the claim area, responsive to the geography and environment of the region, and which adapted to change.
The sort of activities which his investigations revealed does not itself indicate anything about the identity of the society, or their connection with the Larrakia people.
Nor does it provide any reason to infer that there is no connection between that society and the Larrakia people.
I note however that there was no evidence that any of the sites identified by Dr Hiscock have been used by any of the Larrakia people within living memory, nor any oral tradition about when any of those sites were used by them.
The 19 th Century 
 
107 The first Europeans in the immediate claim area were Dutch, exploring the area from their ports in what is now Indonesia, during the 1600's.
However, the northern coast of Australia was not explored in detail until the arrival of English explorers in the early 1800's.
Matthew Flinders circumnavigated the continent between 1801 and 1803.
Captain J C Wickham and J L Stokes carried out further survey work in the area in 1839.
Stokes' published wordlist of 12 Aboriginal words in 'Discoveries in Australia' (1846) (Stokes (1846)) recorded in the area, is suggested to be the earliest record of the Larrakia language.
108 European settlers did not arrive in Darwin until 1869, when South Australian Surveyor General G W Goyder arrived with his team of surveyors.
By 1872, the Overland Telegraph Line was completed, and the increased access to the southern states of Australia, as well as the discovery of gold in the area, resulted in greater numbers of European settlers.
Dr Bourke gave evidence on this era of settlement from an ethno-archaeological viewpoint.
(i) The Ethnographic Evidence 
 
109 Ethnography is a descriptive account of the behaviour of a group of people who are contemporary with the author of the account.
Dr Bourke defined ethno-archaeology, in the context of this matter, as 'a study of modern day Larrakia knowledge and practice of land and resource use for comparison, both with ethnographic and historical records of activities seen around the time of first European settlement, and with material seen in the archaeological record.
' 
 
110 As noted by Dr Bourke, the early observations of the practices of the indigenous inhabitants of the area are limited in number and are general in nature.
However, it was Dr Bourke's opinion that the major ethnographic and historical sources of the time can be assumed to be relatively reliable.
The observations in these sources indicate that the indigenous people in the Darwin region had a 'rich material culture and ceremonial life'.
They took part in ceremonial exchanges with neighbouring groups.
There was extensive exploitation of natural resources for both spiritual and practical uses, on a seasonal basis.
I have drawn from ethnographic sources used by Dr Bourke in my examination of the cultural practices of the Larrakia people during the early European settlement period.
I am not to be taken as having prejudged the question whether the Larrakia people were the society inhabiting the claim area during this early period.
Ultimately, I have found that they were so.
In addition, many of the early documented references refer to them.
It is therefore easier to use the expression 'the Larrakia people' hereafter rather than some more general description of the inhabitants of the general area.
111 The ethnographic and historical sources of this period include Paul Foelsche and Thomas Parkhouse, as well as William Wildey and Harriet Daley.
Paul Foelsche was a police inspector in the Northern Territory and published 'Notes on the Aborigines of North Australia' (1881) (Foelsche (1881)) and 'On the manners, customs, religions, superstitions of natives of Port Darwin and west coast of Gulf of Carpentaria' (1885) (Foelsche (1885)).
He also published 'Port Darwin.
The Larrakia Tribe' in E M Curr, The Australian Race (Melbourne, 1886) (Foelsche (1886)).
Thomas Parkhouse was 'formerly Accountant and Paymaster' for the South Australian railways in Darwin.
His interest was in Aboriginal languages and he published 'Remarks on the Native Tongues in the Neighbourhood of Port Darwin' (1894) (Parkhouse (1894)) and 'Native Tribes of Port Darwin and Neighbourhood' (1895) (Parkhouse (1895)).
William Wildey travelled to Darwin in 1873 and subsequently published an article entitled 'Natives and their habits' in 1876 (Wildey (1876)).
Harriet Daly was the daughter of the Northern Territory's first Government Resident.
She arrived in Darwin in 1870 with her family, and subsequently published 'Digging, Squatting and Pioneering Life in the Northern Territory of South Australia' in 1887 (Daly 1887).
112 Questions were raised by the Territory as to the credibility of the methodology used by Dr Bourke in compiling her expert report, and indeed, Dr Bourke qualified the report herself, saying:
 
 'fieldwork in the Darwin region carried out for this study, and for previous studies summarised in this report, are all of very short duration (generally a few weeks), with a few people.
This represents only a small sample of the Larrakia community, and a sample of the cultural knowledge and activities of the people who took part in the studies.
' 

113 Dr Bourke described her methodology as a 'comparative process', consisting of comparing the archaeological record with the behaviour of modern day people.
She conducted 39 days of fieldwork with Larrakia people.
This fieldwork consisted of Dr Bourke visiting sites with volunteers from the Larrakia community: 16 adults and four children participated.
The adults who participated were Robert Mills, Wes Mills, Violet Mills, Victor Williams, Donna Jackson, Robert Browne, Ted Browne, Lorraine Williams, Bill Risk, Pauline Baban, Patrick Briston, Richard Barnes, LC, Mary Lee, Cathie Wilson and Frank Cubillo.
Of these volunteers, nine gave evidence before this Court.
They were Donna Jackson, Robert Browne, Lorraine Williams, Bill Risk, Pauline Baban, Patrick Briston, Richard Barnes, LC and Mary Lee.
The volunteers were contacted by Dr Bourke using a list of names supplied by the Northern Land Council.
Not all of the family groups were represented.
When asked how she ensured the representative nature of the volunteers, Dr Bourke replied that she checked for consistency between the groups of volunteers and what they said.
114 Several sections of Dr Bourke's report were objected to by the Territory, in particular, sections of the report regarding Dr Bourke's fieldwork.
I received this part of the report on the condition that it be limited to demonstrating the material available to Dr Bourke, except where those sections of the report were based clearly on her personal observations: s 136 Evidence Act .
115 In cross-examination by Mr Hughston SC, Dr Bourke conceded that it was likely that the volunteers she worked with exaggerated their knowledge of resources and participation in resource collection because they knew that her report would be evidence in their case.
116 In these circumstances, there is little if any difference in demonstrating knowledge and collection of resources to an expert witness, and explaining those same things to a Court whilst on an on-site view.
All the Larrakia witnesses who gave evidence before me in this matter were honest and genuine witnesses.
I was very impressed with all of the witnesses who had also informed Dr Bourke, and particularly so with Lorraine Williams, who obviously has played an instrumental role in the increased awareness and interest in, or the revival of, the Larrakia customs and traditions.
117 Consequently, whilst I accept Dr Bourke's observations and views, I do not think that they take the applicants' case much further than the oral evidence.
Her evidence has facilitated and assisted me in better understanding the significance of some of the oral evidence.
As my consideration of the whole of the evidence relating to this period reveals, the indigenous community in this period 1825-1900 carried out types of economic activity consistent with those carried out in current times by the Larrakia people, of course adapted to current society.
118 In the event of manipulation of information provided to Dr Bourke, this would be counter productive if it conflicted with the evidence before the Court.
In this case, the matters recorded by Dr Bourke and the evidence given to this Court overlap and there are significant correlations.
119 The Territory itself recognised in its written submission that ---
 
 'The ethnographic accounts of the late 19 th and early 20 th centuries reveal a rich material culture and ceremonial life practised by the Larrakia and neighbouring groups'.

 

Those accounts reveal systems for the inter-generational transmission of ecological information and resource procurement, a system of alliance and mutual sharing, ceremonies and song cycles of both practical and spiritual significance, often related to particular geographical features or locations, body ornamentation, hunting weapons and cooking and carrying implements.
(ii) The Historical Evidence 
 
120 Before turning to the review of the evidence and the particular findings on those matters, it is appropriate to consider the evidence of Dr Wells in a little detail.
That is because the Territory submitted that Dr Wells' expert historical evidence should be given little, if any, weight, on the basis of an her alleged 'bias' or predisposition in favour of the first applicants.
The submission was directed more to Dr Wells' evidence about the period post 1990 than the earlier period.
121 At the beginning of her report, Dr Wells described the background to the methodology that she adopted.
There were few references in the historical record to Larrakia people between 1920 and 1970.
Dr Wells explained this absence of references to the Larrakia people in the historical record as due to a number of factors.
These included the increased disinterest in 'town' Aboriginal people, the culling of official documents from the archival record and the destruction of official and personal records during the Second World War and the cyclones in 1937 and 1974.
122 Dr Wells also referred to other factors which may have affected the existence of Larrakia people in the historical record.
For example, she said generic terms were often used in historical sources to refer to Aboriginal people, and it was unclear whether phrases such as 'town blacks' and 'Darwin blacks' in particular documents embraced Larrakia people in the township.
Simply because there is no historical record of Aboriginal people in a particular place or performing particular ceremonies does not necessarily result in the conclusion that they were absent from the location or not performing ceremonies.
Rather, it can also be explained by the reporter's absence, or disinterest.
She referred to WW Sowden, a journalist, as having elected not to relate 'disagreeable details' of the Larrakia lifestyle.
Dr Wells also said that Aboriginal people were commonly referred to by geographical area, rather than by language group, in the historical sources.
Constructions of the concept of 'Aboriginality' at the time at which the historical documents were written dictated that Larrakia people of mixed descent were 'rarely' recognised as belonging to a particular 'tribal grouping', and were simply referred to as 'half-castes' or 'coloureds'.
Finally, Dr Wells said that it was 'likely' that Aboriginal people themselves determined which aspects of ceremonial life they would allow non-Aboriginal people to observe.
123 With the background of the relative absence of references to Larrakia people in the historical record between 1920 and 1970, Dr Wells adopted a methodology which, in her words, sought 'to position indigenous peoples as active agents rather than passive recipients in colonial history.
Seeing the Larrakia as active agents requires historians to read against the grain of what is actually presented in historical documents.
' Dr Wells also said that an historian needed to take into account the historical circumstances surrounding historical events.
In the Darwin region, the physical ecological environment underwent an enormous change following the advent of colonialism in the area.
124 Put broadly, the Territory submitted that Dr Wells' evidence ought to be given scant weight, because, it was alleged, she was predisposed in her opinions towards the first applicants.
In particular, the first respondent attacked Dr Wells' reports and oral evidence as advocacy for the first applicants, on the following bases (I have omitted page references to the transcript):
 
 '(a) in Ms Wells' words, she was "employed by the Northern Land Council on behalf of the Larrakia" to prepare her Report; 
 (b) since 1995, Ms Wells has worked as a consultant historian for either or both of the Northern and Central Land Councils; 
 (c) Ms Wells has never been engaged as a historian for someone desiring to test or challenge a land claim or a native title claim; 
 (d) not all historians would approach this exercise using her methodology; 
 (e) applying Ms Wells' methodology, negative portrayals of Larrakia people are to be "valued" less than positive ones, but may, nevertheless, be read so as "to get something useful out of it", such as the fact that Larrakia people were present; 
 (f) one reason for "reading against the grain" of a document would be if the author has used some language Ms Wells does not agree with; 
 (g) Ms Wells has had a particular interest in the Larrakia connection with the Darwin area since 1993 and has spent "much of the last 10 years in archives and libraries researching archival records for information about the Larrakia"; 
 (h) Ms Wells was employed by the Larrakia Nation Aboriginal Corporation to assist in and contribute to the book, Saltwater People, Larrakia Stories from Around Darwin ; 
 (i) Ms Wells' PhD thesis, Aboriginal histories in place, Darwin 1869-1945 , examines the "interactions / negotiations" between Larrakia and white people in Darwin in the early days "as a means of trying to debunk some of the published literature about the Larrakia which has seen them as being friendly and welcoming".
All the chapters of Ms Wells' thesis are relevant to the material in her Report.
' 

125 The Territory also submitted that Dr Wells' approach of 'reading against the grain' is actually an approach of including and emphasising positive portrayals of the Larrakia people and ignoring or re-representing any negative portrayals.
126 The Territory submitted that Dr Wells' predisposition was evident in her treatment of the lack of historical records on the Larrakia people between 1920 and 1970.
Dr Wells advanced various reasons for this dearth of material, but did not canvas the possibility that 'the Larrakia, as a distinct tribal entity, had virtually ceased to exist'.
Nor, according to the Territory, did Dr Wells consider 'that the far more recent assertions of Larrakia survival are more questionable than the historic record expressing Larrakia extinction.
' Dr Wells agreed, in cross-examination, that generally historical records regarding the fate of the Larrakia people were 'overwhelmingly pessimistic'.
127 The Territory submitted that Dr Wells' previous experience as an expert historian was limited to background work in the Urapunga Land Claim and the St Vidgeon Native Title Claim.
Dr Wells gave evidence that she never met any members of the claimant group in those matters, and the Territory submitted that this fact 'discloses the difference between her reports in those matters and her Report prepared "on behalf of" the Larrakia applicants in these proceedings, namely, Ms Wells' methodology of "reading against the grain"'.
In short, the Territory claimed that Dr Wells was 'inherently biased' towards the first applicants.
It therefore submitted that little if any weight should be accorded to Dr Wells' expert history report, and that the utility in the report lay in its narration of the historical events which impacted on the lives of the Aboriginal people in the Darwin region.
128 Dr Wells admitted that she had not read the whole of the Kenbi Report, and that she did not include any of the findings in the Kenbi Report in her expert report.
She admitted that it was 'terribly remiss' of her not to refer to or include the findings in the Kenbi Report which related to the Larrakia people, and which were relevant to her report.
129 I intend to deal firstly with the general contention of predisposition, followed by a discussion of Dr Wells' methodology in preparing her expert report.
130 A good starting point is the Court's Guidelines for Expert Witnesses in Proceedings in the Federal Court of Australia .
The Guidelines do not have legislative force.
Guideline 1 (comprised of 1.1, 1.2 and 1.3) provides that an expert witness has an overriding duty to the Court, and is not an advocate for a party.
131 The explanatory memorandum to the Guidelines provides that 
 
 'An expert is not disqualified from giving evidence by reason only of the fact of a pre-existing relationship with the party that proffers the expert as a witness, but the nature of the pre-existing relationship should be disclosed.
Where an expert has such a relationship with the party the expert may need to pay particular attention to the identification of the factual premises upon which the expert's opinion is based.
The expert should make it clear whether, and to what extent, the opinion is based on the personal knowledge of the expert ... derived from the ongoing relationship rather than on factual premises or assumptions provided to the expert by way of instructions.
... An expert witness does not compromise objectivity by defending, forcefully if necessary, an opinion based on the expert's specialised knowledge which is genuinely held but may do so if the expert is, for example, unwilling to give consideration to alternative factual premises or is unwilling, where appropriate, to acknowledge recognised differences of opinion or approach between experts in the relevant discipline.
' 
 

Dr Wells was cross-examined by Mr Hiley QC for the DCC.
Parts of this cross-examination were relied upon by the Territory to indicate Dr Wells' alleged bias.
It is instructive to consider parts of the relevant cross-examination, which is as follows:
 
 'MR HILEY: ...
I'm asking you whether you knew any more about the identity of the people on whose behalf the applications were being made.

 MS WELLS: Oh I see.
Only informally through my work, you know my work elsewhere.

 MR HILEY: I see.

 MS WELLS: Did I know that --- who the Larrakia people were who were making the --- making the claim.
...
I was employed by the Northern Land Council on behalf of the Larrakia, and so I took my instructions from the Northern Land Council.

 
 [...] 
 
 MR HILEY: I'm inquiring whether you took steps to find out the basis upon which the Larrakia people were making the claim?

 MS WELLS: No, no, I didn't because --- because I was instructed to look at documentary evidence, I went off and looked through the archives and the historical record for the documentary evidence rather than approaching Larrakia people ... to understand that basis.

 
 [...] 
 MR HILEY: ... Now, I then want to ask you a few questions about your CV.
It would appear that since 1995 you have worked as a Consultant Historian for either or both of the Northern Land Council and the Central Land Council, is that correct?

 MS WELLS: That's true.

 MR HILEY: And I take it that you've also --- some of that time has been occupied having children?

 MS WELLS: That's right.

 MR HILEY: So of that 7 or 8 years or so, would half of that time, or a third or whatever, have been spent working as a Consultant Historian?

 MS WELLS: Possibly a third of that time.

 MR HILEY: ... And I take it you haven't been employed as such by either of the Land Councils; rather, you've been engaged on a contract basis on each of those occasions; is that correct?

 MS WELLS: I mean, was employed very briefly as a Researcher for the Northern Land Council for a period of about a month and a half, two months, at one stage.

 MR HILEY: ... And do you understand that one of the main roles of the Land Councils, at least in relation to Aboriginal Land Rights cases, has been to attempt to look after the interests of people who are regarded as traditional Aboriginal owners?

 MS WELLS: Yes.

 MR HILEY: Okay.
And do you also understand that the roles --- one of the main roles of the Land Councils in their capacity as representative bodies under the Native Title Act , is similar; that is, to attempt to look after the interests of those who claim that they have Native Title interests in land?

 MS WELLS: Yes.

 MR HILEY: Okay.
And so do you see part of --- have you seen that as party of your role as a Consultative Historian for those bodies to assist them in fulfilling those roles?

 MS WELLS: Not --- no, I wouldn't --- wouldn't look at my role as that.
I would look at my role as trying to instruct the Court as to the history of a particular region.
For me, it doesn't bear a lot of relation to people on the ground in lots of ways, working in documentary history, I look at the historical record.
I --- you know, I look in depth at the historical record, and I write the report based on what I --- what I see.

 
 [...] 
 
 MR HILEY: ...
So you recognise that it's an important function of yours, as a Historian, to provide the historical basis for these various claims in which you have had an involvement?

 MS WELLS: That's right.

 MR HILEY: And as such, to assist the claimants to advance their case?

 MS WELLS: No, I look at it as assisting the Court to understand the history of particular areas.

 
 [...] 
 
 MR HILEY: ... Have you ever been engaged as a Historian or as a Consultant Historian by somebody desiring to test or to challenge a land claim or a Native Title claim?

 MS WELLS: No.

 MR HILEY: Okay.
In the process of carrying out your research for this case, I take it that you searched high and low for all information that would be supportive of the Larrakia claim?

 MS WELLS: That would be supportive of gaining an understanding of the history between the Larrakia and the whites in this area, yes.

132 Dr Wells gave evidence before the Court for three days, during which time she was examined and cross-examined by counsel for the applicants and the Territory and the DCC, as to the contents of her report and her methodology.
I had ample opportunity to observe Dr Wells as an expert witness during this time.
She was not a dispassionate witness.
She clearly firmly believed in the reliability of the views she had expressed, and was anxious to persuade as to their accuracy.
There is often a fine line between objectivity of presentation and intellectual persuasiveness in communication.
An expert is not expected to abandon or qualify opinions truly held because there is a different view, or to accept a different view as equally arguable if that is not the expert's opinion.
On the other hand, there are occasions when an expert's opinion, having been reached, has lead that person to such a degree of persuasion --- for whatever reason --- that countervailing considerations apparent to others are discussed or rationalised in a way that others do not find convincing.
133 In my judgment, Dr Wells did fall into the category of expert witnesses whose views are so firmly held that I have regard to her evidence with some circumspection.
That is not because I regard her as less than fully honest with the Court.
I have no doubt about that.
Nor is it because she did not properly regard her role as that of assisting the court.
Quite the contrary, she repeatedly (if implicitly) acknowledged her duty to inform the Court, and not engage in advocacy for the first applicants.
She accepted that she was 'employed by the Northern Land Council on behalf of the Larrakia'.
But she frankly acknowledged the limitations on the material she had referred to, and that she had on occasions inferred a background or context to certain historical materials to understand them as consistent with her view.
I am satisfied that Dr Wells at all times sought to fulfil her role professionally and responsibly.
I do not hesitate in accepting her evidence as that of an unbiased expert witness.
134 The Territory challenged Dr Wells' methodology in preparing the expert historical report, and submitted that the first applicants put forward no evidence as to whether it is a methodology widely used or used at all by historians.
In cross-examination, Dr Wells conceded that not all historians would adopt the same approach.
Further, the Territory contended that Dr Wells' self-described process of 'critical reading' was not the method of an expert historian, but rather of an advocate.
135 An historical source document is only as objective as its author.
Therefore, it is reasonable that an expert historian would adopt a methodology requiring a critical reading of source documents.
In Daniel v State of Western Australia [2003] FCA 666 ( Daniel ) at [149], Nicholson J said that it must always be borne in mind that any historical record about Aboriginal people is incomplete.
There are 'silences' in the historical record.
His Honour said that '[t]he nature of these 'silences' and the manner in which they should be addressed is the subject not merely of academic interest, but one that bears directly upon the approach the Court must take in order to interpret the expert and witness evidence, and to derive the inferences that of necessity must be made, in order to decide upon the issues in contention.
' Nicholson J said that this was particularly so in Daniel , where the records of 'police and pastoralists' were 'ethnocentric' and where there was a 'lack of continuity of anthropological observation of the customs, practices and lifestyles of Aboriginal people, and Europeans generally, including police, pastoralists and Native Welfare officers, did not identify people by tribe or language.
' 
 
136 Dr Wells in cross-examination referred to the issue of silences in the historical record, saying, 
 
 'indigenous history has ...changed markedly since the 1970s and prior to that, history was sort of written as, you know, white fellas came and did this to Aborigines.
There was not much said [about] ... the Aborigines responding or having a part in that process, and so over the last 30 years historians have tried to understand the part of Aborigines in that process and understand that they were making informed choices and decisions about ... how they would react to different aspects of colonisation.
' 
 

137 In the light of the cross-examination, I have come to the view that Dr Wells to a degree adopted a view of historical records which was favourable to the Larrakia claimants.
That is not because she was in fact partisan, or was not trying to assist the Court.
It was appropriate for her to assess the significance of elements of the historical record.
I accept, with respect, what fell from Nicholson J in Daniel .
Those observations are equally apt here.
But the cross-examination exposed a number of instances where the historical record was not silent, and where Dr Wells had taken a view as to its significance which appeared not to be justified by its terms or on occasions which appeared to be inconsistent with its terms.
An historian may well regard such an approach as sensible, and as fitting in with a more general thesis supported by other material.
All evidence, whether historical or contemporary, is sought to be understood in its context including the context of its author or speaker.
However, in this instance, the primary sources which Dr Wells sought to interpret or read 'against the grain' were many in number and in a number of instances the reasons for doing so were not persuasive to me.
As the respondents submitted, that material on its face was also consistent with (and in some cases indicative of) the alternative thesis that during the middle part of the 1900s the Larrakia people were not consistently as coherent a society as Dr Wells said the record intended to show.
I think that alternative thesis in respect of that period was not as fully considered by Dr Wells as it might have been.
138 For those reasons, I have approached Dr Wells' evidence about the state and status of Larrakia people as a communal group during the mid 1900s with some circumspection.
I have not regarded her views --- as the respondents would have it --- as having no weight.
In other respects, as appears below, I have placed considerable weight on her evidence.
(iii) The Linguistic Evidence 
 
139 In my view, the expert evidence of Dr Black, a Senior Lecturer in Linguistics at the Northern Territory University, is of great assistance.
Dr Black concluded from the historical record that the Larrakia language has been attested in the Darwin area since at least 1889 and possibly since 1846.
I did not understand the respondents to dispute this conclusion.
140 Dr Black continued on to consider the relationship between the Larrakia language and neighbouring languages, by performing a 'lexicostatistical comparison' of the languages.
Dr Black concluded:
 
 'Larrakia is a distinctively Australian language that shares many characteristics with other languages in the Darwin area.
The available evidence makes it seem likely that Larrakia has been spoken in the Darwin area ever since it began to diverge from a common ancestor with Wulna some four to ten millennia ago.
If the putative grouping of Larrakia and Wulna should turn out to be ill founded, then its similarities with other languages in the area suggest that it must have been spoken in this area for a number of generations, and there is no evidence to suggest that it was ... spoken elsewhere before this.
' 

141 The Territory submitted that the lack of data available to Dr Black undermined his conclusions.
Indeed, Dr Black agreed that Larrakia is no longer spoken fluently.
Foelsche reported in 1881 that each tribe of the north coast spoke a different language or dialect, 'but whether they are only a modification of one form of speech or not I am not in a position to state.
' Parkhouse (1894-1895) wrote that the Larrakia people spoke their own 'tribal tongue', and Basedow (1907), inf, said that the Larrakia people spoke a 'distinct' dialect.
However, Arthur Capell, a linguist who undertook an extensive study of languages in Australia between 1949-1952, and who published an 'extensive grammatical sketch' of the Larrakia language in 1984, believed that Larrakia was 'almost a dead language'.
Capell said that when he conducted his study, no children were speaking the language and he knew of only two people who could speak it.
142 One of the source documents used by Dr Black was a dictionary of 434 Larrakia words prepared by Susan Roman for the Kenbi Claim, which, he said, was a 'very good source'.
However, Dr Black readily conceded that he had worked with a 'limited sample of the language' and that the largest available source material had fewer than 500 words.
The quality of data in relation to the Wulna language, which he compared with Larrakia, was 'very poor'.
This 'permitted some sort of linguistic evaluation', but such evaluation was 'difficult'.
In performing a comparison, Dr Black informed the Court that most lexicostatisticians would avoid words which are 'bound up in culture', such as animal species' names, and that ideally, a comparison should be done with a greater number of words than was available.
However, due to the paucity of data, Dr Black was forced to work with the available set of words.
Despite these limitations, Dr Black came to the conclusion that the Larrakia and Wulna languages shared 23 per cent of the vocabulary tested.
This indicated that these languages had developed in situ from a common ancestor.
143 Alternatively, Dr Black found that the similarities between the Larrakia and other neighbouring languages were such that suggest that it must have been spoken in this area for a number of generations.
144 The respondents submitted that the validity of Dr Black's conclusion that the Larrakia language had developed in situ was questionable.
Counsel for the Territory suggested to Dr Black during cross-examination that both the Wulna and the Larrakia people may have moved into the Darwin region separately but contemporaneously, which would explain the similarities in those languages.
Dr Black admitted that this was a possibility.
However he said that he still believed that it was more probable than not that the languages developed in situ, based on the lexicostatistical information and on what he considered were 'special similarities' between the Larrakia and other neighbouring languages.
Dr Black further based his conclusion on the 'complete absence of any suggestion' that these languages existed in other regions of Australia.
145 The Territory did not lead any expert linguistic evidence which contradicted that of Dr Black.
I find Dr Black to be a qualified expert in linguistics and an impartial and dispassionate witness.
I accept his evidence.
(iv) The Records Relating to the latter part of the 19 th Century 
 
146 From the historical documents, it is unclear whether the Larrakia people were involved in interactions with European explorers such as Stokes in 1839.
When Goyder arrived with his team of surveyors, his initial interactions with the local Aboriginal people were friendly, with bartering taking place between the Aboriginal people and the members of the expedition.
This much is apparent from progress reports written by Goyder.
In one such report dated 3 May 1869, Goyder claimed that they had 'carried on operations so far without collision with the natives.
There are about sixty in the locality, many of whom hang about the fence round the camp from daylight till dark'.
First Class Surveyor A T Woods wrote a complaint to Goyder two weeks after their arrival in Port Darwin, protesting about the 'persistent encouragement and familiarity indulged in towards the natives by many of the men'.
147 W W Hoare, a member of the expedition, kept a diary in which he noted the material culture of the local Aboriginal people, having collected necklaces, bracelets, belts, 'yam bags' and spears.
He noted the way that the Aboriginal people pierced their noses and scarred their skin.
148 Goyder also explored the East Arm of Darwin harbour, where he located a 'native grave in a small opening' near the high water mark.
In a map sketched of the area during his trip, he marked two shell mounds, as well as a 'black's wurley'.
As noted by Dr Wells, these are all indicative of Aboriginal occupation of the East Arm area.
149 Despite initial good relations between the local Aboriginal people and members of the expedition, tensions developed.
In contrast with Goyder's May 1869 progress report, Hoare recorded in March of that same year that '[i]t was absolutely necessary to establish nightly guards for the security of our camp in case of the savages coming on us or our animals' and, in April 1869, '[n]atives troublesome'.
Later, on 8 May 1869, Hoare recorded that '[a] number of armed natives came and wanted to fight us' and that extra guards had been appointed.
150 Relations deteriorated further following the spearing of two surveyors at their camp near the Adelaide River in June 1869.
One of the victims, JWO Bennett, who had compiled a vocabulary list of 'Woolner' dialect, died from his wounds.
In a report on the incident by Second Class Surveyor R R Knuckey in September 1869, it was claimed that before he died Bennett said that the men involved were 'Larrakeas and did belong to the Adelaide tribe'.
Goyder reported that when returning from surveying work to Port Darwin, some weeks after Bennett's death, Aboriginal people had tried to suffocate his group by lighting fires as they travelled.
151 A series of subsequent events during June and July 1869 saw Aboriginal people prevented from visiting the expedition's camp, and the use of firearms to scare them off.
Surveyor Daniel Daly reported that the surveyors prevented potential attacks by 'having their revolvers ready and blazing away at them before they could attack'.
The Adelaide Advertiser published an account from a correspondent in Port Darwin who reported that 'Mira' had been asked 'why the Tarakeer blacks (these belonging to Port Darwin) kept away from us for so long?
' Mira had replied that 'shortly after Bennett's death some of the party enticed them by offers of food and then shot them.
This confirms a rumour current in the camp.
' In his progress report of September 1869, Goyder addressed the attack on Bennett and wrote the following:
 
 'Both officers and men were naturally indignant at Bennett's murder, and, had the order been given for retaliation the punishment of the natives would have been a simple matter with a party so armed; but I considered the attack on Bennett and Guy the results of feelings of revenge on the part of those who had probably lost relatives in some previous contest with the whites ... .
To retaliate, therefore, even could we have identified the murderers, would have been to secure to our successors, less able to defend themselves, a debt of lives to be paid for our act of reprisal, unless we had annihilated the tribe, which was not to be thought of.
I had also to bear in mind that we were in what to them appeared unauthorized and unwarrantable occupation of their country, and where territorial rights are so strictly observed by the natives, that even a chief of one tribe will neither hunt upon nor remove anything from the territory of another without first obtaining permission, it is scarcely to be wondered at if, when opportunity is allowed them, they should resent such acts of violence upon its perpetrators.
' 

152 That Goyder was aware of the existence of distinct Aboriginal territories is obvious from his survey map of the Northern Territory, which marks out four 'native districts': 'Woolner', 'Woolner-Larrakeyah', 'Larrakeyah' and 'Warnunger'.
The 'Larrakeyah' district is, significantly, marked out on 'middle point'.
The Woolner-Larrakeyah district is marked over the Darwin township area.
Another map, accompanying J W O Bennett's 'Vocabulary of the Woolner District Dialect', locates the 'Larrakeyah' district as from 'middle point', south of the Elizabeth River, to the Adelaide River.
153 The Territory in its submissions argued that the historical sources, such as Goyder, Hoare and Bennett, do not specifically refer to the 'Larrakia people'.
Rather, any references are to the local 'Aboriginal people'.
The expedition's camp was in the vicinity of Port Darwin.
It is reasonable to infer that the people referred to in the historical sources were the same people as those who inhabited the claim area at sovereignty.
154 Relations between the Aboriginal people and the white settlers began to improve in 1870.
Bartering recommenced and Aboriginal people were increasingly seen moving about the Darwin region.
The Aboriginal camp on the tableland above the Port Darwin surveying camp was recognised as a Larrakia camp.
155 Dr Wells also observed in her report that there was an 'increasing alliance between the colonisers and the Larrakia and a recognition by the colonisers of the Larrakia's rights, based on prior occupation, to the Port Darwin area.
' She based this conclusion on the aid that the Larrakia people provided to the settlers, and what the settlers did in return.
On 9 June 1870, Acting Government Resident J S Millner reported 'several occasions' where the Larrakia people warned the settlers that the Wulnas were planning an attack on the settlement.
On one such occasion, 
 
 'Larrakeyah blacks came to the fence on table land and called out that the Woolners had attacked them and were also about to attack our camp and requested assistance to drive them off ... .
Sent out a mounted party ... to disperse the Woolners and send them back to their own district, a number of Larrakeyah Blacks accompanied the party'.


156 In July 1870, the then Government Resident, Captain Douglas, decided
 
 'to take the necessary steps to prevent a too near approach of the Woolner blacks to the camp if they manifest hostility to the Larakeeyahs or ourselves ...
Immediately I can get away I shall visit Escape Cliffs and impress upon the Woolners the necessity for peaceful conduct towards the Larrakeyahs in the vicinity of the settlement as well as to ourselves.
' 

157 Following another dispute in October 1870, Douglas told the Larrakia people that 'if they dreaded another attack they could send their old men, women and children close to the camp'.
He 'expected the fighting men to take care of themselves' and did not 'intend to interfere with their intertribal quarrels unless after absolute defeat the Larakeeyahs being in their own district, claimed my protection, when I should take steps to send the Woolner back from the vicinity of the camp.
' 
 
158 The Territory submitted that the aggressions of the Wulnas could well have been an assertion by the Wulna people against the occupation of 'Woolner country' by the surveyors and by the Larrakia people.
Given the linguistic and other ethnographic evidence, I accept this contention.
159 The Territory also submitted that the evidence does not demonstrate an alliance between the colonisers and the Larrakia people.
Rather, it submitted, the Larrakia people 'simply sought whatever protection might be available to them from a more numerous and warlike enemy'.
The historical evidence cited above, however, does point to such an alliance.
Reports of an incident which occurred in August 1870 further reinforce this view.
The Larrakia people were told that the Howitzer Gun on Fort Hill would be shot at their tableland camp if they did not return some axes which had been stolen.
This threat had the effect of inciting the Larrakia people to decamp.
Government Resident Douglas reported that this chain of events had caused him 'much annoyance as I was on a fair way towards utilizing the natives, their presence when on friendly terms tending very much to the safety and convenience of the settlement'.
160 Another incident occurred in November 1871 when Government Resident Douglas was informed by the Larrakia people that the Wulna tribe had arrived and was intent on attacking the Larrakia people and the settlement.
Douglas and a party of 30 officers and men went to the beach, where he 'called the Larrakeyahs back and told them to separate from the Woolners'.
He then 'made a display' of his 'piece ... directed the Woolners to return to their own country'.
The Northern Territory Times dated 5 May 1877, reported on a 'large invasion of Wagites' to the town area and on a 'tremendous row' which eventuated, constituting a 'hearty welcome' by the 'Larrakeeyahs':
 
 'In fact their demonstrations were so ostentatious that the police had to request them to remove further from the township.
We understand that during the various corroborees some of the Larrakeeyas received some ugly blows, which occasioned some ill-feeling between the two friendly tribes, but matters were made up between them, and the Wagites subsequently departed to their own dominions.
' 

161 Disputes between the Larrakia and the Wulna peoples were further reported in November 1878, January 1879 and January 1880.
Correspondence from Protector of Aborigines Morice and Government Resident Price, dated 6 January 1880, recorded that, following a Larrakia-Wulna dispute, Price had ordered Morice to inform the 'Woolners that they must either clear out form the neighbourhood of Palmerston or else cease to attack the Larrakeeyas and behave quietly'.
162 In January 1882 another Larrakia-Wulna dispute occurred and on 4 February 1882 the Northern Territory Times reported that 'the greatest native fight that has taken place in Port Darwin for many years' had occurred, and ended 'in the defeat of the Woolners'.
163 Another 'disagreement' between the 'Larrageeyah, Woolner and Alligator tribes' was reported in May 1887, at the Rapid Creek mission.
An Aboriginal man was said to have 'inflamed' other Aborigines at the mission until they 'determined to throw out the Alligators and drive them back by force to their own territory'.
The 'Woolnar and Larakyas' joined forces to fight the 'very strong Alligator tribe'.
164 Reports distinguished between the disputes detailed above and 'sham fights' which occurred contemporaneously and which according to Dr Wells entertained both Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal spectators.
The Northern Territory Times described one of the 'sham fights' in August 1875:
 
 'Notwithstanding that these games are nothing novel in the township, they always seem to draw a number of spectators.
The hideous frights they make of themselves, the extraordinary contortions into which they throw their bodies and limbs, the agility with which they evade the missiles, and the instantaneous flashes of anger and vindictiveness displayed when one on either side happens to be struck, all tend to make the exhibition an attravtive one to the whites --- that is, so long as they don't get a lick themselves.
' 
 

165 A mission, St Joseph's, was established on the banks of Rapid Creek in 1883 by members of the Jesuit order of the Catholic Church.
The mission
 
 'scarcely [expected] to do much to reform the habits and customs of the older members of the native parties who visit the station, but [felt] very confident of considerable success with the juvenile members, of whom there are a large number, and they are very bright little youngsters, particularly sharp in picking up any thing.
' 

166 An annual report was submitted by the head of the mission (first, Father A Strele (Strele), and subsequently, Father D Mackillop (Mackillop)) to the Government Resident, who included the information therein in his own annual report on the Northern Territory.
167 During the first year of the mission's operation, it attracted 30 to 40 Aboriginal people.
Strele in his 1883 report does not specify the tribes which constituted this number.
In fact, as noted by the Territory, Strele hardly mentioned the Larrakia people in his reports, using instead more generalised terms to refer to Aboriginal people.
Despite this, I am of the view that it can be inferred that Larrakia people made up at least some part of the number of Aboriginal people who attended the mission.
168 I draw this inference on numerous bases, including the very short distance between the location of the mission at Rapid Creek and the township where the Larrakia people were camped, and a press report from the Adelaide Advertiser dated December 1884, which described the construction of the mission as having been 'accomplished by the missionaries, assisted by a number of natives chiefly members of the Larakeeya and Woolna tribes.
' Moreover, in the Government Resident's 1884 notes on the Rapid Creek mission to the Minister of Education, reference is made to a hymn being in sung in the 'Larrakeeyah dialect'.
Further reference to the Larrakia people in subsequent annual reports reinforce this inference that the Larrakia people were among those who attended the mission.
169 Aboriginal people worked at the mission, clearing land, building fences, establishing gardens, digging wells and contructing living and storage areas.
They were paid in rations of 'rice or potatoes, tea, sugar and flour besides tobacco'.
They also engaged in resource gathering: 'To this allowance given them they frequently add something in the way of game such as kangaroo, bandicoots, birds etc., fish, shells, native fruits are also procurable.
' 
 
170 The missionaries supplied the Aborigines with 'hooks and occasionally ... guns' for hunting and fishing.
It was thought 'better not to endeavour to make them give up all their old customs and manner of life at once.
' To this end, in his 1884 annual report, Strele observed that the Aboriginal people 'had to be allowed a few times to spend some days in their own way by going about and visiting their friends at some days' walk distant.
' He further noted in his 1886 annual report that 
 
 'Every morning and every evening children from six to ten years of age were taught the rudiments.
...
However, there is some obstacle to their progress in the innate love of their parents to a wandering life.
The latter take a ramble now and again into the bush, and as a matter of course take the children with them.
The children, however (we have the authority of the parents themselves for it), give them no peace till they return ... again.
Every year they make an excursion or turn to the Adelaide River.
' 

171 By 1888, Mackillop and Government Resident Parsons were reporting on the inability of the mission to address the problems facing the Aborigines in the area.
Mackillop wrote
 
 'The substance of my report may be put into one short paragraph: Hard and constant toil on the part of our fathers and brothers, both here and on the Daly River.
Here at Rapid Creek failure for the present, with very poor hope of future; on the Daly ever-increasing success.
The proximity of Palmerston is the main factor in the failure; the complete absence of the white man on the left bank of the Daly River the greatest blessing to our mission.

 
 [...] 
 
 For more than four months --- from January to May --- we had here, at Rapid Creek, from thirty to forty blacks.
They received instruction in the fundamental doctrines of Christianity in their own language, the children daily attended school, where they were taught the rudiments of English and to read their own language, and all were fed and clothed while they remained with us.
In May came the big fight with the Alligator tribe, and our blacks, fearing reprisals from the Alligators, made off.
They have not, as a body, returned.

 
 [...] 
 
 Many of them (the men are all Woolnas) are now hanging about Palmerston.
...
They prefer Palmerston, because most of them are thoroughly corrupted.
... Sir, it is hard to struggle against the evil influences of the white man's presence.
With the limited means at our disposal, and teaching as we must the restraints of Christianity, the fight is an up-hill one against lust and grog and opium.
' 

172 Parsons wrote:
 
 The Larrakeeyahs, the Port Darwin tribe, appear to be utterly unaffected by the efforts for their evangelization by self-denying fathers and brothers.
The missionaries themselves say that this tribe has been too long and too closely associated with the white settlers to give any hope of being affected by Christianizating influence.
In fact, it is said on excellent authority that recently a corroboree of the old men, who really hold the position of chiefs, in which the attitude of the Larrakeeyahs to Christianity was discussed.
Whatever may have been the aspects in which it was viewed, whether it was too much work and too little tobacco, too much morality and too few shillings, or not, the decision arrived at was --- "Religion along Rapid Creek no good.
" I fear this may be said to apply to nearly all other forms of the faith.
For months none of the Larrakeeyahs have gone near the mission station.

 
 [...] 
 
 The old men and women will hear of no change which would lessen their authority or take away any of their privileges in the tribe.
The young men and women follow in the footsteps of the old, well knowing that in due course they will come into the inheritance, when the choice of the lubras, the delicacies in food, and the traditional exercise of authority will be theirs.
The only hope is the withdrawal of the young children; but their parents will not part with them.

 
 Meanwhile, the apparently inevitable results of a white race settling down alongside a black race are going on.
The blacks learn the vices, and take the diseases of the whites.
The natives' passion for liquor is uncontrollable, and their intoxication is a form of madness.
Partial and intermitted clothing increase pulmonary complaints; and semi-civilised and barbarous habits produce other diseases.
The influences at work are withering away the tribes close by settlements.
' 

173 Dr Wells concluded from these passages that the Larrakia people rejected attempts by missionaries to substantially alter and control their lifestyles.
The Territory submitted that the historical evidence quoted above does not necessarily lead to this conclusion.
It was submitted that alternative reasons, apart from the assertion of traditional laws and customs, may have provoked the view that '[r]eligion along Rapid Creek no good'.
174 There is little doubt that the part played by the abuse of opium and alcohol in the failure of the mission at Rapid Creek was not inconsequential.
However, there are indications that traditional laws and customs were also being asserted, such as those contained in the second paragraph of Parsons' report, quoted above.
The Territory submitted that this paragraph does not make specific reference to the Larrakia people, and in any case, the paragraph 'describes a reluctance on the part of old and young men and women to give up authority and entitlements within the tribe, which is hardly an assertion by the Larrakia of rights in relation to claimed land.
' I have already dealt with the inclusion of the Larrakia people amongst those at the mission.
In relation to the second issue, the paragraph describes the observance and acknowledgement of traditional laws and customs which is fundamental to the issue of connection.
175 In her report Dr Wells commented on the Larrakia people's 'special status', accorded to them by the European settlers of Darwin.
She argued that this status derived from the recognition of the Larrakia people as the prior occupants of the area.
176 Edward Catchlove, an officer who arrived in Darwin in June 1870, walked to the Larrakia camp the day after his arrival, and wrote that
 
 'They are very anxious to know my name, and to make me acquainted with theirs, this tribe they call the Larigeer Tribe, they belong to this place, and are far more civilised than the other tribes.
' 

177 In the census taken between 1899 and 1910, the Larrakia people (which included the following sub-groups: 'town Larrakia', 'Southport Larrakia' and 'Larrakia half-castes') consistently constituted the majority group in the area.
178 Furthermore, the Larrakia people were involved in the settlement, and their presence at many community events was recorded.
For example, Larrakia people were present when the first pole of the northern section of the Overland Telegraph line was planted in September 1870.
Three Larrakia men were taken to Adelaide in late 1870 by members of the surveying expedition.
Larrakia people also participated in sports and games, including a 'spear-throwing competition', to celebrate Boxing Day in 1873.
The sports organised for the Aboriginal people were named after Larrakia generational terms and the names of all the winners of the events were published in the Northern Territory Times.
Members of the tribe worked in the township, as recorded by Wildey (1876).
179 Dr Wells used an incident involving the distribution of rations to illustrate her conclusion that the Larrakia people were afforded 'special status' in the Darwin township:
 
 'Even in the attempts of the colonisers to control and determine appropriate Aboriginal behaviour in the town space the Larrakia demanded and received a distinct status.
In the 1900 distribution of government rations of blankets, tobacco, flour and tea to Aboriginal people elderly Larrakia people did not receive their share ... .
The Larrakia sent a deputation to the local newspaper office with this complaint which had the desired affect [sic] of reinstating their status.
At the following month's ration distribution it was subsequently reported, 
 
 "Blankets, flour, tobacco, etc, were distributed with a liberal hand on Saturday last to the several tribes of aborigines camped in the vicinity of Palmerston.
As one grinning native remarked --- 'My word, that one good feller guv'ment this time.
Him give it blanket all about --- old man, young man, old lubra, young lubra, all about 'im get 'em ... Larrakeyah 'im get 'em four fellow bag flour, Woolna two feller, Waggite two feller, Alligator two feller --- tobacco, blanket, plenty!
'"' 
 
 

180 In her oral evidence, Dr Wells said that it was significant that the Larrakia people received more rations than the other tribes.
She admitted in cross-examination that the passage quoted did not specify whether each Larrakia person received four bags of flour or whether the Larrakia people as a group received four bags of flour.
Mr Hiley QC suggested to Dr Wells that the passage quoted could equally mean that the 'Larrakia people demanded and received rations in circumstances where they obviously deserved them ... [and that it had] nothing to do with their status.
' Further, Mr Hiley suggested to Dr Wells that the fact that there were more Larrakia people at the provision of the rations (as borne out by the census results) is a logical explanation to why the Larrakia people may have received more rations.
181 Dr Wells also highlighted the fact that the Larrakia people had complained to the press about the ration situation:
 
 'opposed to, say, the Wulna or the Wagait if they'd been in a similar situation, we find that the Larrakia are the ones who actually feel that they can go to the newspaper office and invoke the aid of the press in making sure that their status is felt in the town.
' 
 

182 In July 1903, a group of Larrakia people attended the Northern Territory Times office to 'invoke the aid of the press in laying certain grievances before the public' which primarily concerned the lack of response from the Government Resident, Protector of Aborigines or police to complaints about Larrakia women going to live with 'Malays and other coloured nondescripts floating around'.
183 Dr Wells used these two examples to illustrate the Larrakia people using the press to enforce their special status in the township.
The Territory in its written submissions argued that the examples do not demonstrate an assertion of any traditional right.
I agree with that submission.
The Larrakia people used the newspaper to voice their complaints and to seek the assistance of the non-Aboriginal law, rather than to enforce their status in the township.
184 In 1883 the District Council appealed to Protector of Aborigines Morice to move the 'natives' from their Lameroo beach campsite.
Morice's response, published in the Northern Territory Times dated 15 December 1883 was as follows:
 
 '[i]n reply I beg to state that, as for several reasons there is no other camping ground so suitable for the aborigines as the Lammeroo Beach; they shall continue to occupy that position as long as I have any control over the matter; the intentions of the Palmerston District Council notwithstanding.
I have also the honor to call the attention of the District Council to the fact that the camp at the Lammeroo beach is not on Park Lands, but on foreshore, which is reserved by the Government.

 
 In conclusion I have the honor most respectfully to suggest to the Palmerston District Council that, in my humble opinion, it would be much better if they were to exercise their power in protecting the Park Lands ... than in making ridiculous pretensions to Government Reserves, and trying to hound the unfortunate natives from the only place where they can get water and beach their canoes.
' 
 

185 A further incident occurred in 1909, when the District Council requested the Government Resident to 'clear out the native Larrakeyahs from their ancient tribal camping place at Lameroo Beach in order that this might be converted into a cool retreat and place of recreation for sun-baked residents --- particularly the ladies and children.
' Government Resident Herbert replied that 
 
 'no sufficient reason had been advanced for acting upon this suggestion at the present time.
The Larrakeyahs stood upon a different ground from the other strange tribes camped in the neighbourhood of Palmerston.
The Lameroo Beach had been their traditional camping ground ever since the whites first came here, and probably for long prior to that date, and to summarily eject them now --- without good and sufficient reason or some satisfactory compensation --- would be an arbitrary and unjust action.
' 
 

186 In relation to Morice's response in 1883, the Territory disputed that any weight should be placed on the evidence on the grounds that the Larrakia people were not specifically mentioned, and that Morice merely outlined practical reasons for which the camp at Lameroo Beach ought not be removed.
Concerning the first basis, I refer to correspondence from Protector of Aborigines Wood written on 6 August 1885, which recorded that the Larrakia people in Darwin lived on Lameroo Beach.
It is not significant that general terms were used in describing the inhabitants of Lameroo Beach.
The second basis forwarded by the Territory likewise is unconvincing.
The tone of Morice's letter, including phrases such as 'they shall continue to occupy that position as long as I have any control over the matter', indicated that Morice considered that the Aboriginal people camped at Lameroo Beach may have been entitled to do so.
187 Herbert's response to a similar request to remove the inhabitants of Lameroo Beach in 1909 specifically referred to the Larrakia people.
The Territory submitted that the historical evidence
 
 'compels the conclusion that, in the absence of "trouble" or the threat of disease or public nuisance, all Aboriginal people were tolerated about the township, until the impact of the degradations of non-Aboriginal society upon all Aboriginal people was so pronounced that the authorities saw fit to enact the Aborigines Act 1910, which applied to all Aboriginal people, including Larrakia.
Putting it at its highest, the historical record indicates that it was accepted by some of the colonisers that the Larrakia, whose lands were now subsumed by the town of Darwin, had nowhere else to go.
' 
 

188 That there was an element of tolerance of all the Aboriginal people in the township, which dissipated due to public 'nuisance' and the spread of disesase, is undeniable.
However, historical sources demonstrate that on at least two occasions, requests to remove the Larrakia people from their camp at Lameroo beach were refused.
On the latter occasion, in 1909, Government Resident Herbert specifically noted that the Larrakia people 'stood upon a different ground from the other strange tribes camped in the neighbourhood of Palmerston', that Lameroo beach had been their 'traditional' camp site and that to force their eviction from the site would be 'unjust'.
189 As the Darwin township developed, greater control over Aboriginal behaviour and even presence in the town area was sought.
A notice published in the 'Northern Territory Times' on 25 October 1876 by Government Resident Price said that, owing to a recent spate of thefts, 
 
 'instructions have been issued to the Police for the future idle Aboriginals will not be permitted to wander about the Town, either during the day or night.
Those only who are regularly employed by the Residents can remain during the daytime, but they must leave the Town at sunset'.


190 In 1877 the Aboriginal people were ordered to hold their corroborees further away from the township, and after a settler's horse was speared, a threat was made to the Larrakia people that they would all be driven from the township if they did not surrender the culprit.
191 By 1900, tension over the increasing number of Aboriginal people living in the town area had mounted, resulting in the police forcibly removing Aboriginal people from the area and destroying their camps.
Foelsche outlined the situation in correspondence dated 4 July 1901.
It is useful to quote this document at length:
 
 'During the last few months in the old year a number of natives belonging to the "Mimigie", "Woolnah" and "Alligator river" tribes , to the east of, and some of the "Cheerite"  "Mallac-Mallac" tribes to the west of Port Darwin, congregated in and near the town.
The greater number of them being from the Alligator river country.
So long as they behaved they were not interfered with, but as is usually the case when different tribes meet, it ends in fights and quarrels as it did in this instance and towards the end of November troubles commenced, and what the natives call play resulted in several of them getting wounded.
The police endeavoured to stop their doings, but matters got worse instead of better, as will be seen by the following extract from a letter dated 8 th Dec which I received from Mr McKay an officer in the Cable Company.

 
 "I regret having to appeal to you for protection against the continuous danger that exists in driving along the main streets within the town boundaries, three times myself during the last 7 days, while returning from a drive with my wife and child I have had to stop at the end of Cavanagh Street and drive through the bush to avoid being hit by flying spears.
On the last occasion Friday 7 th ... before I could turn my horse, two spears came right over our heads and landed 10 or 15 yards on the other side, had either of them struck my wife, child or myself, the result must have been very serious if not fatal.
" 
 
 I also beg to call attention to a leading article in the N.T.
Times of 14 th Dec last which will give an idea of the general feeling of the residents of Palmerston as to the nuisance of the congregating of the outside tribes in and near the town.

 
 The police for weeks did their best to persuade the visiting natives to go to their own country, but all to no effect and no other [option] was left but to adopt more stringent measures to compel them to shift away from the town.

 
 On the 29 th Dec all but the local "Larrakeah" tribe were notified that, if they did not clear out by the 31 st their camps would be destroyed.
They all promised to do so, but failed to keep their promise and their camps were destroyed by being pulled down, only 3 or 4 wurlies were burnt, but no blankets or clothes ... .

 
 All the camps destroyed ... were in and near the settled portion of the town, and no natives of any tribe employed by Europeans have been told to go away.

 
 [...] 
 
 In sending the outside natives away no hardship is inflicted on them but on the contrary it is to their best interest if they could only comprehend it, as an abundance of native food of all description is easily obtainable in their own tribal country, whereas here they are principally dependent on what they can beg and steal or obtain by prostitution and their dirty habits and filthy camps with a lot of mangy dogs in the town is a positive public nuisance, and the well known fact of leprosy existing among the natives in the neighbourhood of the Alligator river makes their presence here very undesirable if not dangerous to the inhabitants of Palmerston and no other means than those adopted would have made them leave the town ... .

 
 I must also mention that, the natural consequences of such a large number of natives camping in and near the town is, the ever increasing habit of opium smoking among them ... they will do anything to obtain it and thus greatly increase offences ... and create a lot of extra work to the police.

 
 The number of natives not belonging to the local tribe were estimated at over 200 all told, and more than half of them were from the Alligator river country.
' 

192 Dr Wells argued that the fact that Larrakia people were not forced to leave the town area indicated that they were accorded 'special status' because of their 'prior occupancy': '"Visiting" Aboriginal people could be "removed" because they were able to return to their own country but a different issue was presented by the Larrakia who were recognised to already be in their own country'.
193 In light of the above historical source evidence, I conclude that the Larrakia people did have a special status in the Darwin township, as a result of their recognised position as the traditional inhabitants of the region.
(v) Location and Population of the Larrakia Tribe 
 
194 Early ethnographic accounts situate Darwin within Larrakia territory.
Basedow (1907) wrote that the Larrakia tribe was the 'best known, on account of Port Darwin being included within their domain'.
He further recorded that the Larrakia tribe occupied 
 
 'a territory extending southwards between the Howard River on the east and the Finniss on the west, a subdivision or clan, the Marri , having a local distribution near the mouth of the Blackmore River and forming the southern boundary at about twenty-five miles inland.
The Larrekiya further separate themselves into coastal and inland groups, the former being called the Binnimiginda , the latter the Gunmajerrumba .
' 

195 Wildey in 1875 wrote that Larrakia territory was 'located about Palmerston and Southport, as far as the Adelaide [River] and Escape Cliff eastward'.
Foelsche (1886) wrote that Larrakia country extended 'along the coast from the mouth of the Adelaide River, west to Port Patterson' and stretching about 25 miles inland, amounting to 'my informant estimates at 1,024,000 acres'.
On a map included in his article, Parkhouse (1895) marked out the Post Darwin and East Arms regions as 'Larrakiha' country.
Parkhouse described Larrakia land as 'subdivided among the several families, with territorial rights, and the ownership is a real one.
' He further said that the Lameroo beach camp 'as it has been for generations, is the camp of the family in whom that part is vested, among them being also descendents of black trackers introduced by the police from the McArthur or other districts [as well as Larrakia people].
' Spencer (1912), inf, said:
 
 'At Darwin for years past there have been two main Larrakia camps close to the town, one on the top of the cliffs, known as Gwi-ambirra , and the other almost immediately below this, on what is known as Lamouroux Beach, called Nim-birra .
It is quite possible that this may be associated with an original division of the tribe into two moieties, one of which ... always prefers high ground and the other ... prefers lower ground.
In spots such as these two camps near Darwin the mia mias may have been somewhat more strongly constructed, and hence more permanent than on other camping grounds only visited at different times, perhaps at some special part of the year when a particular food supply was plentiful.
The Lamouroux Beach camp is particularly well situated on a somewhat sheltered cove, with a beautiful spring of clear fresh water bubbling up into small rocky pools immediately at the cliff foot, overhung by dense foliage.
The spring is called Korowa demara.
' 
 

196 In 1875 Wildey recorded that there were approximately 300 members of the Larrakia tribe.
Morice in 1882 said that the Larrakia people had diminished in number since colonisation.
In contrast, Foelsche (1886) recorded that there were approximately 500 members of the Larrakia tribe and that this number had not 'decreased' since the 'advent of our country men'.
Cultural Practices of the Larrakia People during the early European Settlement Period 
 
197 Ethnographic and historical sources record the cultural practices of the Larrakia people in the period of early European settlement in the area.
Two authors of such sources were Herbert Basedow and William Baldwin Spencer.
198 Herbert Basedow was the Chief Protector of Aborigines and was located in Darwin in 1911.
His appointment as Chief Protector lasted for only one month.
Previously, he had published 'Anthropological Notes on the Western Coastal Tribes of the Northern Territory of South Australia' (1907) (Basedow (1907)).
These Notes were based on information he gathered whilst acting as Assistant to the Government Geologist on geological expeditions in 1905.
Both Dr Wells and Mr Graham considered Basedow to be an authoritative source in relation to the cultural practices of the Larrakia people during the beginning of the 20 th century.
199 William Baldwin Spencer, an anthropologist, was the Chief Protector of Aborigines, appointed in 1911, following Basedow's resignation.
He had visited the Northern Territory on several occasions, and after arriving in January 1912, was present in Darwin for approximately 10 months.
Mr Graham, in his report, described Spencer as 'Australia's foremost authority on Aboriginal matters' of the time and in his oral evidence said that Spencer was 'a major scholar' and a 'famous anthropologist'.
It was Spencer who made the decision to move the Aboriginal people in the Darwin township to the Kahlin Compound.
200 Dr Wells dismissed the 'negative' and pessimistic aspects of the source material written by Spencer.
Spencer had spent time in remote areas of the Northern Territory and Central Australia, before arriving in Darwin.
Dr Wells considered that Spencer had a preconceived notion that 'town Aboriginal people were corrupted versions of Aboriginal people from more remote [areas]'.
Spencer was occupied with his work as the Chief Protector of Aborigines and could not have focussed on the Larrakia tribe.
Furthermore, he was unable to walk and confined to Darwin for nearly two months as a result of an 'unfortunate accident'.
In contrast, according to Dr Wells, Basedow 'sat down and worked extensively with the Larrakia' people and therefore recorded a lot of information directly from them.
In cross-examination, Dr Wells said that Basedow had been able to gain a lot of knowledge from a Larrakia man who was employed on the vessel on which Basedow toured the coastline in 1905.
201 Spencer did record both in a 1912 article (Spencer 1912) and in his reports as Chief Protector many negative reports concerning the state of the Larrakia people's traditional culture and customs.
He also recorded details that indicate that Larrakia culture had not ceased to exist altogether.
Dr Wells agreed that by the start of the First World War, there was a decline in the historical material concerning Larrakia cultural practices, and that a number of people had made the assertion that Larrakia cultural practices had in fact declined.
202 It is not at this point necessary to decide between the apparently conflicting views of Basedow and Spencer.
Their material is part of the evidence more particularly relevant to the findings to be made concerning the existence and continuance of Larrakia society during the 20 th Century.
There is extensive other evidence directed to the cultural practices of the Larrakia people up to about the end of the 19 th Century.
203 Different tribes existed, each with its own 'recognised land boundary': Foelsche (1885), Parkhouse (1895), Basedow (1907).
Each tribe was subdivided into families, although it was not clear whether each family had its own name: Parkhouse (1894-1895).
204 The elders of the tribes were the decision-makers and their decisions were generally carried out: Foelsche (1881).
Spencer (1912) recorded that the head man of the Larrakia tribe was called 'Bletta dunkal'.
Foelsche and Parkhouse recorded laws governing marriage observed by the Larrakia people, including a prohibition against marriage between related members of the tribe.
Basedow (1907) described various kinship terms.
Parents arranged marriages during their children's infancies: Wildey (1876), Parkhouse (1895); Foelsche (1885).
Widows could become the property of their husband's brother (Foelsche (1881)) or were kept by their own families depending on the circumstances (Parkhouse (1895)).
Polygyny was practised: Foelsche (1885).
Parkhouse (1894-1895) recorded the difficulty of obtaining information about such matters.
205 Historical and ethnographic sources record the use and collection of resources by the Larrakia people.
D E Kelsey, in 'The Shackle.
A Story of the Far North Australian Bush' (1975) wrote that when he arrived in Darwin at a young age in 1873, he would run about with the 'black boys' coming home 'laden with wild fruits and small game that they and their dogs had run down to earth.
' Aboriginal people in Darwin were reported to eat the root of a long black creeper, and were seen tapping tree trunks in the Casuarina jungle for honey.
Harry Stockdale, who spent time in Darwin in the 1880s used the services of Tom Cherry, a Larrakia man, to assist him to catch a crocodile for an Adelaide aquarium.
Stockdale said that Tom Cherry was 'adept at capturing crocodiles'.
206 In a report on kapok, it was said that the Larrakia called it 'balita'.
Further, in March 1887 an Aboriginal man assisted in locating a mineral vein that had 'been known to natives for many years past under the Larrakeeah name of Tappilanda .
' Dr Wells reported that in 1935 reference was made by the Inspector of Agriculture to the Larrakia people's annual hunting technique of lighting fires to assist in yam collection.
207 Foelsche in his publications in 1881 and 1885 and Wildey (1876) referred to the methods by which the Larrakia people obtained food such as geese.
Wildey (1876) summarised that the Larrakia people
 
 'eat roots, grubs and worms, the larvae of ants, land crabs, found in the waterholes, and fish; and they are partial to snakes, lizards, and iguanas.
They readily raise fire by turning rapidly round between the palms of the two hands a stick sharpened to a point into a flat piece of hard wood, around which are dried leaves, which the sparks, caused by the friction of the wood, quickly ignite.
We have also seen them go into the harbour and throw spears at fish; and at night, with a fire stick, they will walk into the water to allure them by the light, then waddy them and so catch them.
' 
 

208 Likewise, S W Herbert in his 'Reminiscences of Life in the Northern Territory during the construction of the Overland Telegraph Line' (1873) (Herbert (1873)) said that '[t]he natives all along the coast had a fine assortment of food to choose from, such as fish, lizards, young alligators, wild fowl, birds, snakes, frogs, grubs, land slugs, kangaroos, turtles, yams, the flowers ... and stem of the water lily and various wild fruits.
In Basedow (1907) described the coastal tribes' techniques in hunting kangaroo, bats, emus and other birds, dugongs, crocodiles, turtles, as well as fishing using rock barriers and the collection of honey.
He also recounted 'folklore of the Larrekiyas' concerning the fresh water and salt water turtles, a story (not specially attributed to the Larrakia people) about how a man was transformed into a dugong and said that the use of traditional fish hooks was 'becoming more or less obsolete from the use of metal hooks obtained by barter'.
209 Foelsche (1881), (1885) noted that turtle, geese and crocodile eggs were highly valued as culinary delicacies.
Methods of preparation of food included cooking on hot coals.
Weapons such as long spears, some with two or three prongs for spearing fish, light reed spears and woomeras were used to hunt and gather food: Parkhouse (1895).
Basedow (1907) described the methods used to hunt and prepare a dugong by the coastal tribes.
210 Foelsche (1885) also listed the natural remedies used by the Larrakia people to treat various ailments: 
 
 'Boils are treated with poultices made with hot water and leaves of certain trees.
Coughs and colds are common among the natives: for these complaints they eat grubs found in mangrove trees.
For diarrhoea they eat a very soft kind of rock of a chalky appearance.
...
Gatherings in the ears are treated with the juice of the fruit of the red Eugenia by squeezing it into the ear after the fruit is roasted.
Neuralgia is treated by applying poultices of the same fruit roasted.
' 
 

211 He recorded that cut wounds and old sores are treated 'with a resinous substance of a blood-red appearance, called by the Port Darwin natives "gnewylah", ... obtained from a Eucalyptus tree' and '[f]resh wounds are also treated with the scraped bark of a bush called by the Port Darwin natives 'malimgarrcah ...''.
Basedow (1907) recorded the existence of a medicine man, without attributing this directly to the Larrakia tribe.
212 Historical and ethnographic sources also recorded information about the ceremonial and spiritual aspects of Larrakia life.
Basedow (1907) records a legend of the Larrakia tribe, concerning a baby boy who 'rose suddenly from the ground out of the burrow of a bandicoot'.
Traditional punishment was chronicled in the Northern Territory Times on 1 December 1888, when an account of a coronial inquest into the death of an Aboriginal woman was published.
Four Aboriginal men from the camp on Lameroo beach 'clothed themselves in a fighting suit of yellow paint, which signifies war' and proceeded to another camp to take part in what was, Dr Wells said, 'an attempted revenge killing against [the camp] for one of their own ... who had recently died.
' In the Adelaide Advertiser in 1922, it was reported that 'Frank, the son of the late King Solomon, of the Larrykeyah tribe ... was arrested yesterday morning on a charge of having speared his young lubra ... at the compound on Friday evening.
The cause, it is alleged, was some infringement of the unwritten tribal laws.
'
 
213 Foelsche (1881), (1886), Wildey (1876) and Parkhouse (1895) all referred to the Larrakia practice of piercing the septum and inducing scarring, for cosmetic purposes.
Basedow (1907) said that 'low cicatrices' were favoured by the Larrakia people and Spencer (1912) said that 'in all tribes cicatrices are made on the bodies of both men and women, with the resultant formation of keloid tissue projecting in rib-like structures, the surface of which is smooth and polished.
'
 
214 Morice in his 1882 report described the appearance of Larrakia people:
 
 'They pierce the septum of the nose and ware [ sic ] a bit of bamboo through it, but although [ sic ] all have the septum pierced yet only some of them ware the bamboo through it.
Their bodies are disfigured with scars on which the flesh has been made to rise in ridges sometimes more than a quarter of an inch in height; these are extended over the arms, breast, back, abdomen and legs, but are never on the face.
They use paint, white, red and yellow very freely ... [and] ornament their heads with kangaroo teeth, cockatoo feathers, part of wild dogs tails, and artificial hair which they fasten on to their own with gum.
Round their necks they ware necklaces formed [of] short bits of grass threaded on string, and also of black and red seeds.
...
They have bracelets round the arm made of plaited grass worn very tight.
' 

215 Harry Stockdale described 
 
 'a fine young Larrakia native in full corroboree war paint, on his forehead is a circlet of kangaroo teeth; his head bound in coils of native hair twine heavily coated with pipe clay and on the top is a little plume of hair like feathers from the Emu.
In his nose he wears a piece of smooth bamboo or reed; and round his neck the loqual [ sic ] or reed necklet.
The white bands on chest and neck are made with pipe clay.
' 
 

216 Foelsche (1881), Wildey (1876), Basedow (1907) and Spencer (1912) also recorded a 'well-known' custom among certain tribes, including the Larrakia people, of removing the first two joints of the right index finger of certain young females.
This was believed to be a sign that the woman would find abundant food for her husband and the tribe.
217 Sources record different types of funereal rites and rules depending upon the age of the deceased person.
Children under the age of two years old were sometimes eaten: Wildey (1876); Foelsche (1881).
Children older than two years, but younger than ten years of age, were buried in shallow graves: Foelsche (1881).
Spencer (1912) reported that after the death of a child 'the mother carries the bones about for a for a long time, and then places them in a cave or in a hollow bough of a tree ... Later on the bones are buried in the ground'.
Young adults were covered in bark and placed in trees until only their bones remained, which were then gathered up and buried: Foelsche (1881) and Wildey (1876).
This practice was also described in an account of an expedition 'From Port Darwin to Escape Cliffs', published in 1874 in the Northern Territory Times.
Spencer (1912) and Basedow (1907) recorded a 'general custom' amongst tribes of constructing 'a platform of boughs and bark in the forks of trees, upon which the body was left until the soft parts had been removed by birds of prey.
' Basedow (1907) said that this custom had been followed 'in former days' and was 'only retained by furthest-out tribes'.
Spencer (1912) said that the bones were buried and stones were placed around the edge of the grave.
According to Foelsche (1881), elderly people were buried in shallow graves.
After two months the grave was opened and the bones were gathered.

 'If the flesh is not off the bones when the grave is opened it is filled up again, and the remains are left undisturbed.
The day after the bones are gathered together and put in a tree they are taken into camp, and a corrobborie follows.
The following night the corrobborie is kept up till next morning, and the bones are buried in a small hole about two feet deep.
' 

218 Upon the death of a member of the group, the Larrakia people would grieve, 'demonstrated by wailing and lamentation; at the same time they cut themselves with any kind of sharp instrument over the head, arms and body until large clots of blood cover the wounds': (Foelsche (1881)).
The South Australia Register reported on 7 August 1875 that, upon the death of a Larrakia man, '[g]rief was displayed by the women in howling and beating their heads and backs and the ground with heavy sticks and some of the men by grotesque actions in running, walking and brandishing their spears.
' A similar incident was recorded in the Northern Territory Times on 29 September 1888.
On 22 October 1909, the Northern Territory Times reported that a 'grand aboriginal ceremonial took place', which was inaugurated in honour of two lately deceased Aboriginal people.
The article reported that at this 'Paint Corroboree', 'the natives appear to have endeavoured to imitate some of the features of the Chinese New Year celebrations.
... there was a quite gorgeous display of fluttering bunting of sorts principally old colored rags furbished up for the occasion.
The braves and their better halves were figged out in full dress regalia of paint, feathers, necklets of kangaroo teeth, etc'.
On 10 December 1909, the Northern Territory Times reported on the death of an Aboriginal king 
 
 'following which 'there was a sound of weird wailing betokening grief for the death of the Larrakeyah potentate and the carrying out of certain funereal ceremonies in accord with native tribal customs.
On Tuesday morning a fleet of five or six native canoes departed for the opposite side of the harbor, carrying corpse and mourners, and the dead king was duly interred in the Larrakeyah tribe's private cemetery ...'.

 

219 In 1904, the Northern Territory Times reported on the death of a 'Larrakeyah native' at the hospital, who was 'subsequently taken away and buried by his fellow tribesmen.
' Comparable occurrences were reported in that newspaper in 1911 and 1913.
There was no description of any specific method of burial in any of these three sources.
Parkhouse (1895) referred to a 'Larrakia burying place' near the Port Darwin cemetery and the Botanic Gardens.
Parkhouse (1895), Foelsche (1885) and Stokes (1846) refer to the practice of not speaking the deceased's name aloud, which is a tradition followed by many Aboriginal tribes.
Basedow (1907) recorded that '[e]very native believes in his re-incarnation after death in the form of some living being which is always held in respect by him.
This belief, however, did not appear to be general amongst the Larrekiyas that were questioned.
'
 
220 Historical and ethnographic sources such as Foelsche (1881), Daly (1887), Parkhouse (1895) and Basedow (1907) also recorded information about 'corroborees' held by the Larrakia people.
Foelsche (1881) recorded that corroborees were
 
 'performed on various occasions, such as when different tribes visit each other, when members of the tribe die, when returning from a friendly visit to another tribe, when they feel inclined to be jolly, when preparing for fighting with another tribe, when portion of a tribe are about to start on some expedition and when they return, and on many other occasions either of friendly or hostile nature.
Sometimes these corroborees last all night, and on mostly all occasions the men paint themselves.
At corroborees in honour of the dead, men and women paint themselves in red, white and yellow; on all other occasions any colour they fancy, which sometimes takes hours to put on, and covers the whole body... Corroborees of a war-like nature are generally held before sundown; for the dead, before and after sundown; and on all other occasions after sundown, whether moonlight or dark.
' 
 

221 Daly (1887) also recorded details of the corroborees that she had witnessed whilst in Port Darwin, which, she said:
 
 'always take place at night.
A number of fires are lit in the centre of the camp.
The men strip, and ornament their bodies with streaks of white chalk, yellow clay, and red ochre.
On their heads they wear crowns of feathers ...
They have spears in their hands, and dance backwards and forwards, sometimes in a line, or in figures partaking of the character of a set of lancers, or some well thought-out country dance --- advancing and retiring in step --- keeping time to a slow monotonous "yah!
yah!
yah!
" kind of chant sung by the women, who beat their waddies on a piece of stick all the time.
' 
 

222 To celebrate the arrival of the Governor of South Australia in Darwin, a corroboree was held.
The Adelaide Advertiser reported 
 
 'Members of the two native tribes of the vicinity --- the Larrakiahs and the Woolnahs --- took part, performing in two opposing factions, each contingent being dressed, or rather undressed, for the occasion, and appropriately decorated with ochre and other fantastic ornaments of fur or feather.
... [T]heir strange antics and manoeuvres, monotonous only to the uninitiated, were carried out with great spirit.
' 
 

223 Ceremonies which young males had to undertake before being 'admitted into manhood' were also recorded in the Darwin region by Foelsche (1881), (1886), Parkhouse (1895) and Wildey (1876).
Herbert (1873) wrote that '[t]he aboriginals in this part of the Territory belonged to a tribe called Larakeeah.
...
The boys, when old enough, retire into the bush for several weeks to be made men a trying and by no means a painless experience.
' The Northern Territory Times reported on 28 May 1881 that the Aboriginal people had been 'very busy of late in the performance of the ceremony of "making young men.
"' Parkhouse (1895) said that:
 
 'The boys attaining to the age of puberty are seized at dusk by men who have been watching their opportunity, and borne away into the bush.
After the news has been spread a corrobborie is held, and they are then removed to a place on the Adelaide River and taken in charge by those whose duty it is to train the youngsters in the arts and lore of their forbears.
... As a fact, besides one lad who has so far eluded capture, and a few living on the premises of their masters, no boys between fourteen and nineteen are seen at Port Darwin.
' 
 

224 Parkhouse also related an event where, to perform a circumcision rite, 'the Wulnar headman travelled with some 200 Larrakia men, women and children 125 miles to Burrundi ...
.
' Dr Wells noted that the Larrakia people 'participated in neighbouring group's ceremonies.
' Basedow (1907) described both the 'First Initiation Ceremony of the Larrekiya Youth --- The Bllier' and the 'Second Initiation Ceremony of the Larrekiya Youth --- The Mollinya', and stated that certain food restrictions were observed during the period between these ceremonies.
Spencer (1912) described the 'Belier' ceremony, held once a year to initiate certain young men in the tribe, and the 'Mullinu Ceremony', held 'after a man's first child has been born'.
He also described 'sacred sticks', used in the Larrakia initiation ceremony, called 'Bidu-Bidu'.
225 Basedow (1907) also described the initiation ceremony carried out for Larrakia women, which included the 'washing of the girl in the sea' and the 'smoking' of the girl.
There was a further 'secret corrobboree [sic] of initiation, about which very little is known, [and which] takes place several years later'.
226 Wildey (1876) and Parkhouse (1895) reported that circumcision was no longer practiced.
Basedow (1907) said 'The Larrekiya does not circumcise, though they say that in early days the rite was practised until, at one ceremony, a subject died from the effects.
Their belief is, now, that if anyone of the Larrekiya were to be circumcised he would die.
' Spencer (1912) said that circumcision was not practiced by the Larrakia people, and that 'it is difficult to say whether the Larrakia have lost the rite or have never performed it.
'
 
227 Larrakia artwork was included in the Northern Territory section of the Centennial International Exhibition in Melbourne in 1888.
Two of a number of drawings displayed were inscribed to have been by 'Billy Muck/Native name Gapal', who was 'attached to the police station as an erstwhile interpreter for cases involving Larakia people.
'
 
228 Information about spirits and dreamings has been recorded.
Wildey (1876), Foelsche (1881) and (1885) and Parkhouse (1895) all recount stories about an 'evil spirit', which went by various names including 'browl', 'birauel', 'dubbo-dubbo' and 'devil-devil', which lived in the bush and which was feared by Aboriginal people in the area.
Basedow (1907) described the Larrakia people's superstitious beliefs in a monster called 'Birrawulidda'.
Parkhouse (1895) witnessed a marriage ceremony in which a post painted with red ochre was said to represent the birauel.
Other stories recorded by Foelsche include the origin of the Larrakia tribe and the origin of 'natives in the neighbourhood'.
229 Spencer (1912) reported '[t]he totemic system of the Larrakia Tribe is, like everything else, in a more or less decadent state, at least amongst the natives in the vicinity of settlements.
... Every individual belongs to a totemic group, and the children take the totemic name of the father.
A man of one totem cannot marry a woman of the same totem.
' Parkhouse (1895) recorded that 'totemism is denied'.
He recounted an incident in which his domestic servant pointed to a green frog, 'alleging, "That one my father".
...
Some months after, he pointed out a pigeon to me: "See that fellow?
him my father"; and, upon my recalling the incident of the frog to his mind, he replied, "That all right; him my father, this one another father.
"'
 Conclusions 
 
230 It is appropriate at this point to address the question whether, at sovereignty, there existed a society of Aboriginal persons having traditional laws and customs under a normative system under which those laws and customs gave rise to rights and interests in the land and waters comprising the claim area possessed by members of that society.
It is also appropriate to identify whether at the time of settlement there existed such a society of Aboriginal persons.
And finally, it is appropriate to determine whether such society as may be found to have existed at the time of settlement (in say the mid 1870s) is the Larrakia people, and is the same society as that found to exist at the time of sovereignty.
Each of those questions is necessary to be answered affirmatively if the claims of either the first applicants or of the second applicants are to succeed: see the discussion above, and in particular Yorta Yorta at [46], [47], [79] and [86].
231 The affirmative determination of those questions at this point of my reasons which I am about to record is not intended to say anything on the subsequent issues which also must be affirmatively answered if the first applicants or the second applicants are to be determined to be entitled to native title in respect of the claim area or parts of it.
232 As I indicated, I am satisfied about each of those matters.
I find that within the geographical area which includes the claim area, at sovereignty, there existed an Aboriginal society which, by its traditional laws and customs, had a normative system which gave rise to rights and obligations on the part of its members in relation to the land and waters within that area.
The archaeological evidence points to there having been some form of society at that time, albeit directly demonstrating only an 'economic' society.
From the time of the first observations of the area by European observers, their observations are in general terms consistent with there being then, and there having been, such a society.
Again, the observations are only a course indication of such a society.
233 From the time of European settlement of the Darwin area, as one would expect, the range of available material is much more extensive.
That material, covering a period of three decades or so, reveals then the existence of a society of Larrakia peoples who had a close attachment to the land and waters in the area, including in the claim area.
The basis of that finding is evident enough from the foregoing.
I also conclude again on the basis of the findings I have made above, that the Larrakia peoples had a normative system by reason of their traditional laws and customs which created rights and obligations possessed by them in relation to the land and waters of the claim area.
In particular, the Larrakia people identified themselves as a society in that way; they spoke the Larrakia language, and they had a complex and sophisticated set of laws and customs.
Those laws and customs included rules governing their internal societal relationships, the way they dealt with the land and waters and the collection and use of its resources, and the ceremonial and spiritual aspects of their relationships with the land and waters of the claim area referred to.
234 It was the Territory's contention that the Aboriginal people present in the Darwin region in 1825 were not the same group of people attested to as 'Larrakia' in sources dating from 1869.
The Territory in its written submissions suggested that the Larrakia people present in the late 1800's, at the time of the earliest historical and ethnographic sources, were relative newcomers to the area.
It relied on historical and ethnographic observations of the use of pearl shell hooks for fishing and of canoes to hunt dugongs and sea turtles: Daly (1887); Parkhouse (1895).
These observations were not confirmed by the archaeological record.
Further, the Territory draws support from the evidence of epidemics, in particular, smallpox, which led to a decrease in the Aboriginal population in the Darwin region shortly before European settlement in 1869: Foelsche (1881).
In 1839 Stokes observed that Aboriginal people in Port Darwin were suffering from a type of 'influenza ... all having the remnants of colds, coughing severely'.
235 I do not accept that contention.
I have referred above to the absence of archaeological evidence of capture and consumption of dugong and marine turtle.
That indicated the practice is relatively recent, but did not exclude it from being a pre-sovereignty practice.
The points the Territory makes must also be seen in the light of other evidence.
236 On the basis of Dr Black's views, which I accept, I find that the Larrakia language has a common ancestry with the Wulna language, extending back over many generations.
That finding, together with the absence of any evidence to suggest that any other language group existed within the claim area and the wider Darwin area at the time of sovereignty, leads me to the view that, at sovereignty, the Aboriginal society which then existed was in general terms the same as the society which existed at the time of European settlement of the general area.
That is, the society which the archaeological evidence indicated was in existence in the lengthy period leading up to sovereignty (although as noted it did not itself lead to identification of the nature of that society other than in economic terms) was the Larrakia people.
237 The longstanding existence of the Larrakia language in the area tends to negate the suggestion that the Larrakia people were recent arrivals (i.e.
mid to late 19 th Century arrivals) in the Darwin area after some other society had been dominant in that area.
There is no other real evidence to suggest that at 1825 some other society was the dominant society in the Darwin region and had then been displaced by the Larrakia people, or replaced by the Larrakia people after that original society had been very substantially reduced by disease.
The existence of the observed disease or diseases does not itself lead to that conclusion, especially as the source of the putative epidemics was suggested as Macassen or other traders from the north who in any event were likely to have exposed all coastal Aboriginal groups with whom they traded or had dealings in the same way.
238 Consequently, I also conclude that the society which occupied the claim area at sovereignty was the same society, with the same traditional laws and customs (whether adapted by economic or environmental factors or not) as I have found to have been the occupants of the Darwin region including the claim area in the latter decades of the 19 th Century.
239 It is the events of the 20 th Century upon which the respondents then relied to challenge the applicants claims that:
 
 (a) they continue to have and practise the same traditional laws and customs as the Larrakia people did at sovereignty, and from around the turn of that century; and
 (b) they and their forbears have continued to do so substantially uninterrupted during the 20 th Century and to the present time, so that any alterations in their traditional laws and customs are merely adaptations from the changes generally in society.

 The Period 1910 - WW II 
 
240 In 1911, the Commonwealth, by agreement with the South Australian Government, assumed responsibility for the Northern Territory.
It adopted the Aborigines Act 1910 (Aborigines Act), which was 'An Act to make Provision for the better Protection and Control of the Aboriginal Inhabitants of the Northern Territory', assented to on 7 December 1910.
The Aborigines Act 1910 
 
241 It is useful to outline some of the central provisions of the Aborigines Act.
The Aborigines Act established the 'Aboriginal Department', 'charged with the duty of controlling and promoting the welfare of the aboriginals': s 4.
The position of 'Chief Protector of Aboriginals for the Northern Territory' was created: s 7(1).
The Chief Protector was the 'legal guardian of every aboriginal and every half-caste child, notwithstanding that any such child has a parent or other relative living': s 9(1).
242 Pursuant to s 16(1) of the Aborigines Act, the Chief Protector could:
 
 'cause any aboriginal or half-caste to be kept within the boundaries of any reserve or aboriginal institution, or to be removed to and kept within the boundaries of any reserve or aboriginal institution, or to be removed from one reserve or aboriginal institution to another reserve or aboriginal institution, and to be kept therein' .


243 If a person refused or resisted removal to, or escaped any reserve or institution, that person was guilty of an offence: s 16(2).
Visitors to the reserves and institutions were restricted under the Aborigines Act: ss 18, 42(1).
244 The Chief Protector was also empowered to order and cause the removal of any camps near 'any municipality, town, township, public-house, or wine and spirit store': s 43(1).
Police officers were authorised to order any 'aboriginal or half-caste "loitering"' to leave the area: s 44(1).
Any person who refused to obey such orders was guilty of an offence: s 43(2) and s 44(2) respectively.
Further, the Governor, by proclamation, could declare any place to be an 'area in which it shall not be lawful for aboriginals or half-castes, not in lawful employment, to be or remain', 'whenever in the interest of the aboriginals he thinks fit': s 45(1).
245 The first Chief Protector appointed was Dr Herbert Basedow, who lasted less than a year in the position.
In that time, however, Basedow ordered his staff of Medical Officers and Inspectors to investigate the conditions of Aboriginal people in and around Darwin.
A report delivered to Basedow dated 27 July 1911 by Medical Inspectors Burston and Holmes recorded that eight camps had been visited and that the 'Larrekiya' tribe was 'by far the most numerous but several other tribes ... [were also] represented'.
The 'Larrekiyas' were resident chiefly of two camps situated a quarter of a mile to the west of the town, 'one being on a cliff and the other on the beach below'.
Burston and Holmes also visited a Larrakia camp at Point Charles, which is not an area subject to these proceedings.
246 Inspectors Kelly and Beckett produced two reports for Basedow, dated 29 July 1911 and 11 August 1911 respectively.
They recorded that the Aboriginal population in the area was approximately 225, the preponderate percentage of which were Larrakia.
'The representatives of nearly all the coastal tribes from the Victoria to the East Alligator rivers are to be found at Darwin'.
Kelly and Beckett recommended 'placing all of the unemployed natives upon a suitable settlement where they might be taught to assist themselves to be largely independent.
'
 Establishment of Kahlin Compound at Cullen Bay 
 
247 There had been mounting pressure on the Government Resident to remove the Larrakia people from their camping ground at Lameroo Beach.
Prior to the inception of the Aborigines Act, Protector of Aborigines Stretton supported the establishment of a 'permanent camping ground for the natives outside the boundary of the township.
...
The natives would be far better out of the township, those only who are employed to be allowed within the boundaries of the township.
' There were various plans to remove the Larrakia people from the town.
Basedow, in July 1911, developed a 'Scheme for the Protection, Medical Supervision and Systematic Employment of the Australian Aborigines'.
Under this 'scheme', a 'Larrakeyah reserve' was proposed for the sea front adjoining the Botanic Gardens where the Larrakia people would be employed as 'attendants and watchmen' as well as being 'an additional attraction for visiting travellers'.
A second reserve for less 'civilised and educated' members of the Larrakia tribe was to be established at a more remote location.
On 8 December 1911, Beckett, by then a Protector of Aborigines, wrote:
 
 'The task of keeping the unemployed natives out of Darwin has been a difficult one chiefly on account of the camps being situated so close to the town and the problem of where to put them.
I am now hopeful of being able to overcome the trouble.
Having brought the influential members of the various tribes together and held a conference with them, the Larrakeya's, Woolner Wargite  Alligator tribes have agreed to camp in amity on a piece of Crown land adjoining the Botanical gardens on one side  the Railway line on the other nearly two miles from the town and to keep away from the town at night  when not at work.
Having consulted the acting administrator he has assured me that some assistance will be given to the natives to re erect their huts which will have to be demolished.
' 
 

248 The Northern Territory Times, also dated 8 December 1911, confirmed this report, stating that 'no coercion is being exercised in this matter, the aboriginals being quite satisfied to form new camping grounds on the assurance that the authorities will assist in making "new feller house"'.
249 In January 1912, following Basedow's resignation, Professor William Baldwin Spencer arrived to take up the position of Chief Protector for a period of one year.
Spencer was anxious to remove the Aboriginal inhabitants of Darwin from the 'detrimental influences surrounding them' in the form of opium and alcohol, and immediately made plans to 'remove all aboriginal camps from the vicinity of the town of Darwin'.
250 In choosing the site for the Aboriginal camp, Spencer had regard to the Larrakia campsite at Lameroo beach:
 
 'The largest Larrakia Camp is located, half on the cliff forming part of the Esplanade bordering the Harbour and half on the beach at its base.
This division into two, an upper and a lower camp, is of long standing and has been respected in the choice of the new site which is located at Cullin's Beach outside the limits of the Township.
' 
 

251 In 1912, modern-day Cullen Bay, situated to the north-east of the town, was an undeveloped, relatively isolated area, consisting of a short beach fronting a narrow strip of land backed by cliffs and a ridge.
This was the site selected for the establishment of the new Aboriginal camp, which became known as the 'Kahlin Compound'.
The compound comprised 'about 13 acres ... [with] a boundary fence consisting of posts of local timber and barb wire.
' By the end of 1913, there were 'sixteen bark huts, a boys' dormitory, girls' dormitory, kitchen, laundry, office, storeroom, coach-house and fodder room, a fowl house, and some old dilapidated buildings in the gardens.
' A school was established for both Aboriginal and children of mixed descent.
The indigenous population of the compound fluctuated according to the season.
In 1915-1916, the average population was 195, and in 1916-1917, it was 230 people.
252 In his 'Preliminary Report on the Aboriginals of the Northern Territory' dated 20 May 1913, Spencer commented on Aboriginal people living in settled areas of the Northern Territory, stating: 'These natives have so completely lost all their old customs that there is no difficulty in gathering them together into a village or compound, as is now being done in Darwin.
' Under the heading 'Aboriginals Living in Towns', Spencer wrote '[t]hese natives have long since become degenerate and have lost all their old customs and beliefs.
' He further recorded '[o]ne thing is certain and that is that in all parts where [Aboriginal people] are in contact with outsiders especially with Asiatics, they are dying out with great rapidity'.
253 In relation to traditional laws and ceremonies, Spencer observed that 'in many cases where the tribes, as in the immediate neighbourhood of Darwin, are not only demoralized but decimated, the old rules cannot be enforced'.
He wrote that the existence of regularly performed ceremonies 'forms a very serious practical difficulty in connexion with any attempt ... to remove the aboriginals from any particular part of the country except in settled districts where they have lost all their old beliefs and, to a large extent, given up performing their old ceremonies.
'
 
254 Spencer outlined his economic plan for the compound.
The inhabitants were to be self-supporting, 'as they will be employed either in the [compound] garden or in business places or private houses', although rations would be distributed to 'old and indigent' residents.
Spencer further recommended the introduction of regulations, including a prohibition against any Aboriginal or mixed descent person being outside the compound or an employer's residence after sunset without a 'special permit'.
Further, no Aboriginal person should be allowed to leave Darwin without permission.
255 In her report, Dr Wells said that Spencer had 'not understood the continuing status of the Larrakia who again used the local press to make public their dissatisfaction that Aboriginal people from another district were having their houses built first, that the earlier promises of Inspector Beckett regarding their own housing were not being fulfilled and questioned the motives of the Government for removing them in the first place.
' The Territory submitted that there was scarce evidence that the complainants were Larrakia, and further that any evidence of such complaints was equivocal.
In the Northern Territory Times dated 16 February 1912, a 'Billy Muck', in a complaint entitled 'No Good Government', questioned 'Whaffor that one Pisher Gubment huntem allabout my countryman long old pfeller camp and makem sit down close up that new pfeller wurley?
' In another complaint published 29 March 1912, a journalist described how an Aboriginal man 'fired at the worried scribe a volley of questions', including 'What for gubment gib it new pfeller house longa Alligator, no more gib it longa Larrakeah?
' 
 
256 I have previously discussed whether the use of the press by Larrakia people demonstrates their 'special status' within the township.
It is therefore unnecessary for me to determine the weight to be attached to such evidence.
257 Correspondence and newspaper articles highlight that Spencer was not immune to community criticism.
One incident involved Spencer sending away a Larrakia boy to a Western Australian pastoral station in an act of what was described by the Northern Territory Times (31 May 1912) as 'compulsory and heartless expatriation'.
258 Spencer's successor, Chief Protector W G Stretton, supplied the Administrator with a 'Report on Aboriginals Department, 1913', annexed to which was a report of Inspector Beckett.
Stretton related that 'Most of the camps in the town have been broken up, and the aboriginals removed to the compound at Kahlin.
It has been a difficult matter to induce the different tribes to amalgamate and fraternize.
' In defence of the compound plan against those members of the community 'who would like to have the natives as slaves', Stretton unequivocally stated 'We are occupying their country, and must give them something in return, and all that we can do is to improve their condition according to our way of living.
' Concerning the Kahlin Compound, Stretton reported that there were 76 inhabitants as at 31 December 1913.
259 Pursuant to the Aborigines Act, Aboriginal children of mixed descent were removed from their mothers, and placed in a 'Half-caste Home' in the compound, separated from other residents by a fence.
Particular care was taken to remove the girls from the influence of 'full-blood' Aboriginal people.
A former resident of the 'Half-caste Home', Val McGinness, recounted in 1988 that '[t]hey didn't separate us boys from the full bloods and they didn't try to stop us learning Aboriginal ways ... Matter of fact all us Half-caste boys used to join in the Aboriginal ceremonies and all that, dances, corroborees.
' The Territory in its written submissions argued that this passage demonstrated the way in which the Aboriginal people 'drew together in their "Aboriginality", lending practices and customs between each other, with the effect that none could be said to be referable to the original "Larrakia society"'.
I will deal with this submission below in my discussion of whether the connection element is satisfied.
260 Criticism of the compound became public within years of its establishment.
In a letter to the editor in the Northern Standard newspaper dated 26 September 1922, the compound was referred to as 'not only a blot upon Darwin, but a blot upon the white race' and the author said that it was 'practically impossible to describe the conditions obtaining there, and the herding of filthy, diseased, blackfellows and lubras'.
Previously, in 1917, the 'whole of the town and neighbourhood of Darwin', except for the compound, was declared a 'prohibited area' under the Aborigines Act, making it an offence for an aboriginal or mixed descent person to be anywhere but in the compound without a permit.
The Aborigines Act was replaced with the Aboriginals Ordinance 1918 (NT), which stipulated that all Aboriginal people in Darwin had to live at the compound and increased penalties for Aboriginal people discovered in prohibited areas or outside the compound during curfew hours without permission.
In 1927, the Commonwealth government held an inquiry into indigenous affairs in the Northern Territory, led by the Chief Protector of Queensland, J W Bleakeley.
In his 1929 report on 'The Aboriginals and Half-Castes of Central Australia and North Australia', Bleakley noted that there had previously been problems with residents of the compound leaving the boundaries without permission and visiting the Half-caste Home with designs of 'immorality'.
261 The Territory submitted that the asserted 'lack of control' in the compound was not demonstrative of any assertion by or recognition of Larrakia rights to land, even if that fact is coupled with the assertion that the majority of residents were Larrakia people.
I agree that a lack of control in the compound is not by itself indicative of an assertion of Larrakia rights to land.
However, it may be significant that, despite the threat of 'white feller' sanctions, residents of the Kahlin Compound persisted in moving outside the boundaries of the compound.
I shall further consider these aspects when reviewing the effect of all the relevant evidence.
262 In 1923 a Committee of Inquiry into the Compound was appointed to deal with continued public and official criticism (the Inquiry).
The Committee received oral evidence and evidence in the form of written statements from members of the public on the necessity and location of the compound, and the desirability of sheltering both people of Aboriginal and mixed descent in the same place.
263 In her report Dr Wells stated that 'the Inquiry highlighted the persistence of unauthorised Aboriginal camps in Darwin as well as the Larrakia's status as traditional owners'.
The phrase 'traditional owners' was later revised to 'prior occupants'.
I received this evidence, which was the subject of an objection by the Territory, in accordance with s 136 of the Evidence Act , limited to 'reciting a description of the inquiry'.
The Territory in its written submissions argued that this evidence does not, in fact, recite a description of the Inquiry.
264 In the Inquiry's report of 4 July 1923, there was no specific mention of the Larrakia people at all.
The only reference to the Larrakia people was indirect: 'All natives, not employed, [should be] compelled to live in the Compound, or, in the case of natives from outside districts, sent back to their country rather than be allowed to remain in indolence in Darwin.
' [emphasis added]
 
265 However, the Inquiry's report ought to be read in the context of other documents that were tendered.
In his letter dated 2 July 1923 to the Committee Chairman, Mr C J Kirkland suggested 'sending back to their own districts of all natives other than Larrakeyahs who are not engaged in some employment', a reference to the Larrakia people's prior occupancy of the area.
He also drew attention to the 'abominable traffic' of opium and alcohol which was occurring.
Similarly, Albert Woods, a contractor in Darwin, suggested in his evidence that another compound be established a further distance from the town, and that it 'be solely for the old Larrakeah natives'.
A Lands Officer from the Home and Territories Department, writing on 24 October 1923, stressed that '[a]part from the cost involved in the proposed transfer of the Compound ... it must be recognised that the natives associated with the compound are occupying what to them is [a] portion of their recognised tribal area.
' He further stated 
 
 'The Township of Darwin was surveyed in 1869 or 54 years ago and a certain amount of occupation has been effected during that time.
Consequently the natives whose tribal area had been encroached upon, gravitated to the town and, up to the time of the transfer of the Territory to the Commonwealth, were utilized by the whites occupying the town in various capacities, as servants etc., and were allowed to wander about and camp in the vicinity of the settlement without restriction.
Naturally after a number of years association with the town, these natives have to a great extent lost their bushcraft, and now depend solely on what they earn or is given to them in lieu of wages for the work they perform in the Town, for their sustenance.
In order to restrict the camping places and prevent undue numbers wandering about the Town during the day and night, the existing Compound at Cullen Beach was established by the Northern Territory Administration.
' 
 

266 In the context of these documents, which refer to the Larrakia people either directly or indirectly, I find that the statement by Dr Wells does reflect a feature of the evidence before the Inquiry.
267 The Chairman of the Committee of Inquiry, J T Worgan, sent a report to the Administrator dated 4 July 1923.
In it, Worgan noted that the present site of the compound was 'condemned' by a majority of witnesses.
Reasons for such censure included its proximity to residences at Myilly Point, sanitary issues, and compound residents' drunken behaviour.
268 Worgan observed that the current system 'or want of system' allowed 'formation and continuance of odd camps of natives in or near the town' and suggested that 'natives from outside districts ... [should be] sent back to their own country'.
The Committee also advocated separating mixed descent children from their parents and opined that:
 
 'The present system of allowing both male and female half-castes entre to the Aboriginal Compound, and allowing them to associate freely with the full-blooded natives we think undesirable as it inevitably tends to bring the half-caste down to the level of the native.
By tactfully gaining the confidence of the half-caste boys and girls ... much would be done to create a favourable and happy atmosphere that would give the half-caste a fair start along the road of civilised life.
' 
 

269 The report also outlined the numbers of residents at the compound, as at 31 May 1923.
The number of residents totalled 418, which number was comprised of eight tribes and 41 residents of mixed descent.
Larrakia people constituted the majority tribe, with 81 resident at the compound.
The next most numerous tribes were the 'Waugites' and the Melville Islanders, each with 76 residents, followed by the Bathurst Islanders (38), the Mulac Mulac tribe (36), the Anson Bay tribe (30), the Brinkin tribe (18) and the Wool Wonga tribe (2).
There were also 20 people accounted for at the compound clinic, whose tribes were not noted.
270 The then Administrator of the Northern Territory, F C Urquhart, responded to the Committee's report in correspondence to the Secretary, Home and Territories Department, on 4 July 1923.
Urquhart referred to the complaints against the compound as '95% fictitious and [as having] ... scarcely any foundation in actual facts'.
He stated he was thus 'unable to advise that the recommendation of the Committee should be given effect to'.
Urquhart further reported that the Melville Islanders in the compound had been sent home, that any camps which existed outside the town had been dismantled and that illicit sale of alcohol was being attended to.
271 In 1925 the Half-caste Home, with a population of 21 girls of mixed descent, was removed to outside a house 'about a hundred yards from the compound'.
Boys were later accommodated in the downstairs part of the Home.
In 1929 Bleakley said that '[w]hile the conditions are vastly better than in the compound dwellings and clinic, it is freely admitted that the housing of 76 children, of different sexes, in a house large enough only for one family, is not satisfactory.
' However, he supported the removal of the children from their parents' care, saying that the 'object of the home is to save these half-castes from the degradation of the blacks' camp, properly care for and educate them, and fit them to take a useful part in the development of the Territory.

272 Dr C Cook was appointed Chief Protector in 1927.
Cook's 'Half-caste Policy' was one of assimilation, whereby it was intended 'to elevate the half-caste's standard of living to that of the white, and to assist him to take his place in the community both socially and industrially'.
Under Cook's policy, 
 
 'the mating of an aboriginal with any person other than an aboriginal is prohibited.
The mating of coloured aliens with any female of part aboriginal blood is also forbidden.
Every endeavour is being made to breed out the colour by elevating the female half-castes to the white standard with a view to their absorption by mating into the white population.
' 

273 In his Annual report for 1933-1934, Cook claimed 'real progress' had been made and that 'practically all half-caste children of both sexes, formerly left to live with aboriginals in compounds and bush camps to reach maturity as aboriginals, have been removed to half-caste institutions under Government control.
' Cook also claimed that better accommodation and schooling facilities were being provided to these children.
At 30 June 1934, the number of 'inmates' at the Half-caste Home in Darwin was 106, 13 of whom resided with their employers.
274 Cook's policy involved strict control of women of mixed descent.
This control, as well as the general living standards in the Half-caste Home, generated criticism from members of the public and from officials.
A report of W V Lancaster dated 8 October 1936 to the Secretary of Department of the Interior referred to the 'most unsatisfactory conditions under which the adult half-caste girls live on the compound'.
He described the 'practice of locking adults in houses at 7.30 pm until next morning' as 'calculated to result in the very trouble which it is desired to avoid', the 'sanitary arrangements' as 'not satisfactory', and the 'compulsory deduction by the Chief Protector of 2/- in the case of half-caste women with dependents and 1/6d in the case of single women for the Medical Benefit Fund' as 'unfair'.
275 Correspondence from J B Waldie, a member of the public, dated 21 April 1936, also complained about the conditions in the Half-caste Home: 'to ... keep the girls locked up under these conditions is a disgrace to any civilised country'.
He further said that the women had 'no chance of leaving the compound unless they are married', and complained about the insufficient food and clothing provided to the residents.
276 In March 1939 the Northern Standard reported that five girls had escaped from the Half-caste Home.
All were arrested and charged with being in a prohibited area.
Two of the girls were sentenced to three weeks' imprisonment.
In March 1940, the Northern Standard reported that there had been 'allegations of bestial treatment towards half-caste girls in the Darwin compound'.
A former inmate of the Half-caste House has written that Cook 'never wanted us to mix with the full-blooded Aborigines.
He kept us away ... he wanted us to marry into white and get rid of our own ...
Aboriginality.
'
 
277 Cook did not exercise the same level of control over Aboriginal men and women of mixed descent who were married and raising families in Darwin.
However, he attempted to increase his level of control with his 'Half-Caste Housing Policy', sent to the Administrator on 2 February 1932.
In this policy, Cook outlined 'the problem with which the Administration [was] ... confronted':
 
 'There are in Darwin some 39 male and 53 female adult half-castes with 90 children dependent upon them.
These people being adults are for most purposes beyond the control of the Chief Protector.

 
 [...] 
 
 All of these Half-castes are inadequately housed.
Several live in the Police paddock [modern day Stuart Park] in the closest proximity to the lowest grade coloured alien population, others live in the Unemployed camps as comrades of agitators and extremists of Communism, others in shacks and humpies suburban to Darwin.
These huts are in the last degree insanitary, not weather-proof, ill-ventilated, overcrowded, dark and usually unfloored.

 
 [...] 
 
 It can be readily recognised that these people provide a promising field for the endeavour of the agitator, who attacks the social system.
These people cannot appreciate that they have any place in the social system, it has removed from the native camps where they would have been happy, and brought them into the town to face nothing but want and misery.
It must be recognised that this is a problem of great magnitude requiring immediate attention.
These conditions are evolving an immoral degenerate coloured population which, under the influence of communistic agitators, is becoming indolent, embittered and revolutionary.
' 
 

278 Cook said further, 'It remains ... to rescue these adult half-castes no longer under legal control.
As a first step in this direction I recommend that proper housing be provided for these people.
' He borrowed money from the Aboriginal Trust Account to build eight houses under the scheme.
However, Dr Wells noted that the development of the scheme was cut short by the acquisition of the houses by the armed forces during World War Two.
279 The living conditions endured at the Kahlin Compound were similarly miserable.
In his report, Lancaster provided an account of the lack of edible food and adequate water, and described the accommodation as consisting of very crowded huts.
In addition, 'on the compound beach a number of aboriginals had small humpies ... most them were removed within the next few days.
It is understood there is a periodical clean up of this nature.
'
 
280 Dr Xavier Herbert was the Superintendent of the compound in 1936.
He gave evidence in relation to the compound in 1980 at the Finniss River Land Claim Inquiry before the then Aboriginal Land Commissioner, Justice Toohey.
Herbert gave evidence concerning the system of 'capturing cross-blooded children and bringing them in here ... .
The females ... were locked in a sort of prison within a prison.
' He said that following Cook's appointment as Chief Protector in 1927, there was a concerted effort to increase the number of mixed descent children in the compound.
When asked about the effect that removal from their parents had on the children, Herbert replied that 'everybody was terrified of this.
There had been some system of taking away before ... but now there was a concerted effort to bring these people in'.
Herbert further stated that a person of mixed descent who associated with Aboriginal people would lose their 'status': 'if you ... had a good job ... had a house and a job in the government, if you went back to the [Aboriginal] camp you were out.
' 
 
281 The aim of compound authorities was 'there was to be no Aboriginality whatsoever in that compound'.
However, Herbert claimed that the aim was not achieved.
For example:
 
 'There was a rule in the compound with half-caste children so-called that their mothers were not allowed to have any dealings with them and the children were not to have any dealings with their mothers.
A lot of the mothers came here because their children had been taken from them and gave themselves into work in the compound.
The blacks did not want to lose their half-caste people.
They meant the same to them.
They were their children and everybody was responsible for them --- men and women.
... of course you were not allowed to let them in with them, but they could, say, feed them and fondle them through the ... they used to have sort of big concentration camp fences to keep the children in, and they used to do this sort of thing through the fence.
' 

282 In cross-examination, Mr Hiley suggested to Dr Wells that some of the historical material suggests that mixed descent people were not regarded by full-descent Aboriginal people as being members of the tribe.
In particular, Mr Hiley referred to the article written by Wildey, where he said that 
 
 'Half-caste children are not met with amongst the natives, their code of morality being very strict.
In fact, should such a little contre-temps happen to mar the domestic felicity of a family, it is said that the inopportune advent of the little stranger would quickly furnish a feast to the tribe, which countenances no interlopers of a fairer complexion.
' 
 

283 Dr Wells pointed to Herbert's description above of the lengths to which Aboriginal mothers went to maintain contact with their children.
Mr Hiley made the distinction between families accepting their children, and the tribe accepting the children.
284 Cook imposed more rules to control the movement of Aboriginal people in the area, including the introduction of numbered identity disks.
Dr Wells considered that Herbert's evidence highlighted the inability of compound officials to 'contain the population'.
285 Herbert confirmed the existence of a 'dusk to dawn' curfew, however
 
 'It did not mean there were not Aborigines around the town because there was another system working here, an illegal system, which provided the town with Aboriginal labour of probably equal strength.
That was done by the Aborigines and largely the Chinese.
...
This was done by the people belonging to this locality we are talking about, Cox Peninsula --- that is Kungarakany, Larrakiya, Wagaitj, Brinken and Marathiyel people --- who would spend half their time in the traditional way and half their time working in here.
Everybody endeavoured to do that to try to get walkabout.
Some of them got trapped in the compound.
They would all have their reasons, and some of them were not able to get back to the bush again.
These people who were still living in the old way would have, say, a couple of months in the bush ... and then they would come to a ... meeting place.
' 

286 Herbert described how Aboriginal people who had been working in the town area would cross the harbour to the West Arm:
 
 'They would go back then ... with their pay-off which was always in kind --- food, flour, sugar, tea, loaves and things like that and a thing that was very important to them, a thing called turkey twill from which they used to make nagas which were supposed to have magical qualities.
They used to sneak back in canoes and land on Fosters Beach and there used to be ceremonies.
I think, from my limited knowledge at the time, that they used those meetings for a purpose.
There was always something going on.
There were some funereal things that had to be gone through --- all sorts of ceremonies which are beyond the comprehension of anybody but an anthropologist.
... Then those people would go away into the bush and others would come back here and take their places in this illegal trade.
' 
 

287 Dr Wells argued that it was the inability of the officials to contain the Kahlin Compound Aboriginal population that provided one of the arguments in favour of its removal in the mid 1930's.
In 1934 Acting Northern Territory Administrator J A Carrodus suggested that the 'presence of the Compound in a populated area is undesirable for many reasons.
It should be removed to a site outside the town boundary or in a portion of the town where its presence will not interfere with the non-aboriginal residents.
' By 1936 Cook had agreed that the site at Cullen Beach was no longer suitable and had initiated discussions to remove it elsewhere.
On 24 March 1936, an article in the Northern Standard reported on a meeting called by King George of the 'once great tribe of Larrakeyahs' which was attended by the 'old men of the tribe ... [and] the Acting Superintendent'.
The author of the article, who was invited, also attended the meeting.
The article stated:
 
 'King George pointed out that they had heard reports that the Government intended to shift the present compound to some point inland to make way for more Myilly Point residences.

 
 "The Larrakeyah people are a salt water tribe and would not be prepared to live away from the sea", said King George.
"This is all the country we have left, and the Government should leave us on it.
Years ago we use to have our camping grounds on Lamaroo Beach and I was born there as were most of the old men of the tribe.
Our water supply was the native well where the present baths are now located.
When Doctor Basedow and Dr. Gilruth shifted us to this place they promised us certain things but those promises were never kept.
We have cleared this land and built our houses, and we should not now be asked to shift.

 
 [...] 
 
 Several speakers pointed out that the Compound was given to the Larrakeyah tribe, and they objected to members of other tribes camping and living at the Compound.
... Another complaint is that the tribe is becoming detribalised and that the children are not learning the language of the tribe but a mixture of the languages of the tribes now resident in the Compound and English.

 
 It was pathetic to see these old men endeavouring to safeguard the interests of the tribe.
Asked what they would do if ordered by the Government to shift to another compound, they said they would rather go bush ... .

 
 [...] 
 
 On the whole [our] writer was greatly impressed at the work being carried out by the aborigines for their own comfort, and left with the feeling it would be far better to exclude the outside tribes and allow the Larrakeyahs tribe which has had nearly a hundred years association with the whites to remain in residence on the small piece of land which they claim was given to them by Dr. Basedow and Dr Gilruth.
' 
 

288 Acting Chief Protector of Aborigines, W B Kirkland responded to this article in the Northern Standard by a letter to the Administrator of the Northern Territory, dated 17 June 1936.
The Larrakia people's concerns were dismissed by Kirkland as being 'more imaginary than real'.
He further said about the Larrakia people:
 
 'The remnants of this tribe have long concentrated in the precincts of Darwin which, with adjoining coastal belts terminating in the regions of Point Charles and East Point respectively, comprised their former tribal territory.
Of late years most of the surviving members have been permanent residents at the Kahlin Compound.
Any problems which might beset the removal of the Compound to another site are rendered comparatively easy when viewed solely in relation to the Larrakeyah tribe.
' 
 

289 Kirkland assured the Administrator that the site selected for the new compound was 'definitely situated in Larrakeyah territory and thus would provide for them a camping ground in their tribal area, proximity to centres of totemic and ceremonial significance'.
In relation to concerns about the 'intrusion of neighbouring tribes into their domain', Kirkland stated that this did not 'introduce a basis of objection', since 
 
 'for many years past the Larrakeyah tribesmen have fraternised and intermarried with their neighbours, the Wargites, and they claim close kinship with the Woolner group who are their near neighbours on the Darwin side.
It is anticipated that the Woolner, Wargite and Larrakeyah people will comprise the majority of the population in the new Compound.
' 
 

290 Kirkland further claimed:
 
 'It was observed that the tribe is practically detribalized in the extreme.
This assertion is proved by accurate statistics which were compiled by the observer.
At present there are 45 pure Larrakeyah people, comprising adults and children, residing in the Compound.
Of the 13 married males 10 are consorting with lubras of other tribes: of the 8 married lubras 3 only are consorts of Larrakeyah males.
20 of the adults are over 50 years of age, their expectation of life might possible by some 7 years.
There are 14 children under the age of 13 years.

 
 It was gleaned that ceremonial centres in the vicinity of Darwin had been abandoned for several years and that initiation ceremonies were not conducted some five miles from Darwin, entailing a voyage across the harbour by canoe; thus any suggestion that their proposed removal usurped their rights to ceremonial centres is adequately contradicted.
' 
 

291 Kirkland reported that the Chief Protector had met with the male members of the Larrakia tribe and outlined the government's intentions in relation to their removal from the Kahlin Compound.

 'When they were acquainted with the site of the proposed Compound and the arrangements that were to be made for their accommodation, for the schooling of their children and the rationing and welfare of the old people, they expressed pleasure at the Government's action, commenting that they were grieved that they had made trouble for the Government.
' 
 

292 The Territory disputed that the meeting called by King George was an assertion of rights to the land on which the Compound was situated on the basis of prior occupation, and argued that complaints reported were in fact related to a concern that people of mixed descent were receiving more benefits than members of the Larrakia tribe.
The Territory noted that Dr Wells agreed with this analysis in cross-examination, but 'read against the grain' to show that the Larrakia people's sentiments were a complaint that the colonisers were not keeping their end of the bargain.
293 The Territory submitted that Dr Well's 'description [of the situation] is not what was disclosed by the source documents'.
In particular, the Territory referred to Kirkland's response to the article, in which Dr Wells said Kirkland 'assured King George' that the proposed compound site was located within Larrakia country.
In fact, Kirkland assured the Administrator that this was the case, in the context of 'erroneous information supplied to the aboriginals by persons who were not sufficiently acquainted with the intentions of the Department.
' 
 
294 As to whether the meeting called by King George was an assertion of rights to the land on which the Compound was situated, it is informative to review the article published in relation to the meeting.
In the article, King George affirmed (as did Kirkland in his response) that the Larrakia tribe was a 'saltwater people' and objected to being asked to move to another site.
He said that 'this is all the country that we have left'.
King George also objected to members of other tribes camping at the compound.
As the Territory pointed out, the Larrakia people also objected that 'half-caste' aboriginals were receiving more benefits from authorities than 'full-blood' aboriginals.
295 In cross-examination, Dr Wells stated that in the article, the 'Larrakia are feeling that they have been hard done by, that they negotiated with the colonisers to be here [at the compound], to share their country, and those promises haven't been kept.
' The Territory submitted that Dr Wells agreed that Larrakia people did not assert rights to the land on which the compound was situated.
296 It may be that the Larrakia people did not at the meeting specifically assert their rights to the land on which the compound was situated.
It was reported that they said that they were a saltwater people, that they would not be removed to a place located at a great distance from the beach.
King George referred to the removal of the tribe from Lameroo Beach when the compound was first established, and to the empty promises allegedly made by the government.
However, I find that the Larrakia people were, as Dr Wells claimed in cross-examination, aggrieved that the government had not ensured that the Larrakia people maintained a particular status as prior occupants of the area.
Additionally, it is significant that Kirkland, in his response, remarked that the Larrakia people had been 'detribalized', but also noted that the new compound site was within their tribal area, providing proximity to 'centres of totemic and ceremonial significance'.
297 A site located on Bagot Road was chosen and gazetted as the Bagot Aboriginal Reserve on 10 March 1938.
By May of that year, all the Aboriginal residents of the Kahlin Compound had been transferred to the Bagot reserve.
The 'Half-caste Home' remained where it was, outside of the Kahlin Compound, until 1939 when the residents were transferred to Bagot reserve.
298 In 1941 the demand for Aboriginal domestic servants in Darwin had 'greatly exceeded the supply available ... partly due to the repatriation of a large number of people to their rural districts.
' It was reported in the Annual report for that year that '[e]very available native in Darwin was in employment during the year ... Every male half-caste in Darwin has been employed at award rates of pay, and the half-caste population as a whole is enjoying the boom conditions at present prevailing.
' A report at that time on living conditions for Aboriginal people residing with their employers contained a list of people who identified themselves as from the Larrakia tribe.
This list included: Sam Kundook, Frank Lahm, Ettie Wurramurrabuck, Dick Mungnarabet, Flora Nabruma, Fat Amy Bandu, Topsy Tarta Marna, George King Ickongadilik, Benedict Lenmaniker, Lucy Demooil, Mary Minmurrin, Fred Nadpur, Dedja Batcho, Dolly Carinee, Elsie Normbill, Lindy Batcho, Paddy Denuguile, Peter Marringa, and Olga Singh.
299 In 1941, Delissaville Station (Delissaville --- now known as Belyuen) on the Cox Peninsula was taken over as an Aboriginal settlement.
Originally intended as a 'welfare centre for sick and unemployed local aboriginals', military occupation of the Bagot reserve meant that many Aboriginal people in Darwin were moved to Delissaville.
Cultural Practices of the Larrakia people between 1910 and WW II 
 
300 Accounts of the cultural practices of Larrakia people during this period exist, however are more general than earlier ethnographic accounts.
301 As cited above, Spencer in his 1913 'Preliminary Report on the Aboriginals of the Northern Territory' stated that the 'Aboriginals Living in and about Townships' had 'completely lost all their old customs'.
Dr Wells admitted that Inspectors Kelly and Beckett, like Spencer, were at least initially pessimistic about 'Larrakia cultural survival'.
In their reports, Kelly and Beckett said that of those Aboriginal people employed in Darwin, 'some have even conquered the almost irresistable [sic] habit of taking a periodical "walk about alonga bush" and have settled down to live upon the premises of their employers and avoid visiting the camp .
' However, 
 
 'it is a common thing for a native to arrive unannounced at some white person's house in the morning and start doing things such as carrying wood and water ... and just as common for the same native to disappear in the same casual way to "go bush" for a month or so' .


302 In their August report, Kelly and Beckett recorded the following about the Larrakia tribe:
 
 ' [W] we noted that tribes extending over a very wide radius are represented in the various camps scattered around the town.
Though the Larrekeya (in whose tribal district Darwin is situated) preponderate the Wulna Yowitch (West Alligator) Abiddul (East Alligator) Woolwonga and others are met with.
All of these aboriginals fraternise and live upon the most amicable terms.
Tribal differences and animosities appear to be matters of ancient history and to a great extent even tribal ceremonies which, in times past were regarded in the light almost of immutable laws are not persistent.

 
 The rites appertaining to the elevation of the boy to the status of man and later to the rank of warrior are still carried out --- occasionally, but the fact that many adult native men are met with whose skins do not show a single trace of any tribal mark makes it plain that the ancient customs which in times gone by were performed with rigorous and relentless severity are, at least among those tribes which are constantly associated with the white people, gradually dying out.
Even the operation of circumcision, the escaping of which three times brought the death penalty upon the evader, in those tribes which practised it, is now frequently and easily avoidable.
As the Larrakeya, once the most powerful tribe along the Northern Coast never circumcised, nor operated in any way other than the making of raised cicatrices upon the body, that tribe appears to have much more easily fallen away from the old order of things.
The more intelligent of the aboriginal freely admit that tribal ceremonies are dying out, they accept the changed times as inevitable.

 
 [...] 
 
 The "Wander lust" that peculiarity of aboriginal habit which makes the black in his wild state so difficult to deal with, and so hard to discipline --- is not by any means strongly developed among the natives who hang about Darwin.
Few of them "go bush" for any length of time ...'.

 

303 Dr Wells in her report argued that Kelly and Beckett did not disclose information about the strategies adopted by the Larrakia people to 'survive the changes wrought by colonisation'.
Nor can it be determined from these sources whether the Larrakia people interviewed by Kelly and Beckett deliberately withheld information about cultural practices.
304 In oral evidence, Dr Wells pointed out that Beckett and Kelly made the above comments after only one month in Darwin.
In cross-examination, she conceded that she was unaware whether either Kelly or Beckett had had previous experience with Aboriginal people.
She also argued that the statement that the traditional customs were 'dying out' ought to be considered in the context of a contemporaneous notion that the Aboriginal population was 'doomed to die out'.
I note that the DCC objected to this statement as opinion without any basis.
305 Dr Wells also used Beckett's later reports in 1913 and 1916 to demonstrate that Beckett's opinion of the Larrakia people had evolved from his initial report.
In 1913, Beckett said of the Larrakia people:
 
 'Though the town of Darwin is situated upon the country of the Larrakia tribe, that tribe has now fewer representatives in the town than have other tribes from distant places.
As the result of close observation and careful inquiry amongst the aboriginals, it appears plain to me that the Larrakia tribe, once strong numerically and influential along the north coast, has been brought very low.
The Larrakias are now greatly outnumbered in their own country.
Disease and excesses have killed, and are still fast killing, them off.
Yet considerable virility still persists amongst them, for several tribally married couples at Darwin are raising large and vigorous families, but in each case these are people who indulge neither in opium or alcohol.
' 
 

306 In his 1916 report, Beckett related:
 
 'Owing to the fact that Darwin occupies the seat of the tribal district of the Larakias a great deal of latitude has been accorded those of that tribe who have desired to stay about their heritage.
Their ancient burial grounds, used from time immemorial, are on the beaches and in the jungles fringing the beaches.
Their traditions are woven around the headlands and landmarks along the shore.
The land we have built upon is the tribal property of various Aboriginal families and the right of ownership is still impressed upon the children.
Taking these facts into account every consideration has been given to the Larakia tribe of Darwin and, in order to compensate for the necessity of removing them from certain old established haunts, weatherproof accommodation has been provided for them on Kahlin beach with ample coroboree grounds adjoining.
' 
 

307 In cross-examination, Dr Wells admitted that Beckett had not resiled from or qualified his earlier statements in 1911.
Given that the 1916 report was written by Beckett when he had five years of experience working with the Aboriginal people in the Darwin region, I am inclined to give this report greater weight than his earlier reports.
308 Dr Wells claimed in her report that '[r]eferences in the historical record indicate that Larrakia cultural life persisted and that the Larrakia continued to sustain their status as prior occupants of the Port Darwin region after they were moved into the Kahlin Compound at Myilly Point in 1912'.
Indeed, according to the 1915-1916 Annual Report of the Administrator it was noted that within the compound, native customs and names were 'so far as possible, encouraged'.
Further it was reported that the co-operation that existed between '"King" George of the Larrakeah Tribe, who exercises no small authority', and the 'Superintendent' was of 'considerable value in the maintenance of discipline and harmony'.
Similarly, the death of '"King" Solomon', 'a very good native, who always exerted a good influence over the young men in his tribe' is recorded in a 1916-1917 report on Kahlin Compound.
The Territory submitted that any co-operation which existed between these men and the Superintendent is of little relevance.
However, the point that King George exercised 'no small authority' and assisted in maintaining 'discipline and harmony' is relevant to the issue whether an elder structure continued to exist during the Larrakia people's first years of residence at the compound.
In 1954 it was reported that a Larrakia man, Fred Nadpur, had been appointed as 'King' at a meeting held at Delissaville, and that Prince of Wales was appointed as his successor.
309 The preceding paragraphs provide one illustration where, in my view, Dr Wells drew from the available material somewhat more than was warranted and minimised the significance of contemporary information adverse to her views without sufficient warrant for doing so.
The primary material indicates that, apart from there being some form of elder structure within the Larrakia community, the Larrakia people were mixing and living apparently harmoniously with a number of other Aboriginal groups and it suggests that --- publicly at least --- there were few if any ongoing indications of the continuing exercise of the traditional laws and customs which previously were recognised and practised.
310 There was nevertheless, at least until about 1930 or a little later, evidence of some ongoing ceremonial activities.
311 There was evidence that the Aboriginal people in the Kahlin Compound participated in ceremonies, including corroborees, at the compound and across the harbour on Cox Peninsula.
Dr Xavier Herbert described certain ceremonial activities, which I have outlined above.
Mrs Gilruth, wife of the Administrator of the Northern Territory, informed the Northern Territory Times in 1914 that 'The Government has made compounds for [Aboriginal people], and they keep to their own quarters, especially when having their corroborees.
The lubras must be let off for the evenings, and they go to the camps and are ardent followers of the corroborees, which are kept up until all hours'.
In 1918, patients in the compound medical clinic were locked in because 'it was discovered that patients under treatment left the hospital at night to participate in corroborrees [sic] at the Kahlin Beach'.
Mr Hiley in cross-examination suggested that there were various reasons for which the patients were locked in the clinic at night, including the tendency of patients to leave the clinic before treatment was completed.
However, as pointed out by Dr Wells, the 'lock-down' of the clinic was put into place in order to 'immediately and effectively' prevent the patients from attending corroborees at Kahlin beach.
312 In 1927, a 'tribal ceremony' connected with 'making five natives "young men"' and 'another five bucks "old men"' was said to have taken place 'with all due solemnity and prescribed rites according to the ancient custom' and was reported to have been 'brought to a successful conclusion ... the whole business lasted about two feller months' and 'after a lengthy sojourn along bush it finish up along Point Emery', near the Compound.
313 Evidence of corroborees held at the Kahlin Compound corresponds with historical evidence from the Koolpinyah station journals.
Koolpinyah was a cattle station established near modern day Litchfield in 1908 at which many Aboriginal people worked.
The journals contain references to Aboriginal people passing through the station in May 1927 on the way to the Compound for 'young men making'.
Gerrard, a young worker, was reported to be 'going in' to 'be made Banenigar[?]'.
Three weeks later, it was reported that Gerard was 'back from Sunday business'.
Dr Wells asserted that Gerrard was a Larrakia man, based on records from 1957 (the 'Register of Wards' referred to below) containing information that a Larrakia man named Gerrard Nei-langga was resident at the station.
314 During cross-examination of Dr Wells, Mr Hughston SC for the Territory suggested that the 'Gerrard' referred to in the journals, and the 'Gerrard Nei-langga' in the Register of Wards, were not the same person.
Mr Hughston adverted to the fact that the Koolpinyah station journals only span from 1909 to 1941, leaving a 16 year gap before the 1957 records were taken.
Mr Hughston also noted that the name 'Gerrard Nei-langga' is never referred to in the journals.
Dr Wells said that it was the practice of the time to not use a person's Aboriginal name in records.
315 I note that the Register of Wards states that Gerrard Nei-langga was 50 years of age, meaning that in 1927, at the time of 'young men making' he would have been 20 years of age.
I also note that the Register of Wards records that Gerrard Nei-langga was married to a woman named 'Mable'.
There are no references in the station journals to Gerrard's last name, however there are numerous references to 'Gerrard and Mabel', such as 'Gerrard and Mabel went for a spell' (28 March 1935), 'Gerrard, Mabel and [her] sister returned' (22 May 1935), 'Gerrard's mob and Mabel's mother and two children added arrive' (28 February 1937), 'Gerrard and Mabel here about 2 with 3 doz fresh goose eggs.
They are on their way to Howard to see if they can go in to the corrobberie [sic] at Compound' (12 April 1939).
316 It is possible that the 'Gerrard' and the 'Mabel' who were recorded as working at the Koolpinyah station in the journals had moved on by 1957 and that another 'Gerrard' and 'Mabel' had taken their place.
However, it is unlikely.
Given the references to 'Gerrard and Mabel' in the station journals and the fact that the age of 'Gerrard Nei-langga' is consistent with the description of Gerrard in the station journals, I find on the balance of probabilities that the 'Gerrard' referred to in the 1957 records as a 'Larrakia' man was the 'Gerrard' referred to in the station journals as going to the Kahlin Compound for 'Sunday business'.
317 Dr Wells referred in her report to a report in 1931 that Aboriginal people from Darwin had recently gone to Shoal Bay to attend a corroboree, to records in 1935 that Aboriginal people had arrived 'from Shoal Bay to report a young man making', and to a report from the Acting District Welfare Officer in 1935 that 'many natives have been congregating on [a Mr Litchfield's property] from Kulpinya and Nightcliff to attend a big "Santa business", or ... a Gunabippi Corroboree.
This business has been going on four or five weeks.

318 In her report Dr Wells stated that '[g]iven previous ethnographic accounts of Larrakia people participating in neighbouring group's [sic] ceremonies it is likely that the Larrakia had some hand in the 'tribal custom of making a young man' from the 'Wargait tribe' held at a 'big feller corroboree' at the Compound in 1935'.
This was reported by the Northern Standard in April 1935.
There was no indication in the article that the Larrakia people had participated at all in the corroboree.
Dr Wells relied on previous accounts, principally that of Basedow in 1906, to demonstrate that the Larrakia and Wagaitj tribes had traditionally participated in corroborees together, and 'If they did [so] in 1905, then I can suggest that they did in 1935.
'
 
319 Dr Wells also noted that Larrakia people participated in 'ceremonial performances' for tourists to Darwin, in the 1920's and 1930's.
In April 1929, the Northern Standard reported on a corroboree held at Mindil Beach for passengers of the 'Marella' in which members of the Larrakia tribe participated.
The Koolpinyah station journals record that in April 1939, 'Gerrard and Mabel' were on their way 'to see if they can go in to the corrobberie at Compound for the tourist boat'.
The Territory in its written submissions rightly pointed out that a corroboree for tourists does not necessarily constitute a 'ceremony'.
320 In examination-in-chief by Mr Parsons QC, Dr Wells gave evidence on the issue of Larrakia people participating in ceremonial activities at the Compound.
Dr Wells said:
 
 ' [T] here's quite detailed accounts of Larrakia participating in --- in ceremonies or corroborees ...at the Compound.
Often they're reported as being tourist corroborees, and my opinion as a Historian would be that the tourist corroborees are reported in the paper but perhaps other ceremonies that were not for public consumption were also being held.

 
 I can find you a page reference of the report to --- to other ceremonies happening at the Compound.
... Again, it says that: "Larrakia were reported to have participated in a special corroboree at Mindil Beach".

 
 Again, as a Historian, I have to think okay, well where were those Larrakia people living.
81 of them at least were in the Compound.
And, indeed, all the Aborigines in town at the time were required by law to live in the Compound, so we can ... assume that those --- those Larrakia people who were participating in the Mindil Beach corroboree were from the Compound.
' 
 

321 Dr Wells made the assumption that because the Larrakia people took part in corroborees for tourists, other ceremonies 'not for public consumption' were also being held.
On the basis of evidence from the station journals of corroborees being held at the Compound, this is not an unreasonable assumption.
322 Val McGinness, a Kungarakan man and former resident at the Compound, recalled having witnessed Aboriginal burials at the Compound.
'Aboriginal people were not allowed to be buried in the general Darwin cemetery so when a person died at the Compound the body was placed in a canoe and paddled around to Mindil Beach where a burial took place'.
Skeletal remains which were identified as 'fully Aboriginal', as well as others of mixed descent were uncovered in the Mindil Beach area during the development of the casino in 1977.
The Territory submitted that there are no references in Val McGinness' account to Larrakia practices or customs, since he was of a different tribe.
It further submitted that the account supported a conclusion that 'the Aboriginal people in Kahlin Compound drew together in their "Aboriginality", lending practices and customs between each other, with the effect that none could be said to be referable to the original "Larrakia society"'.
There is considerable force in those contentions.
323 The Territory argued that Dr Well's assertion that the historical sources demonstrate that Larrakia cultural life persisted even after the Compound was established was incorrect.
It submitted that Dr Well's conclusion was based on a combination of 'references to "Aboriginal" corroborees and ceremonies not attributed to any particular tribal group' and the '"fact" that Larrakia people constituted the majority of those in the Kahlin Compound'.
324 I have already referred to the 1923 report which provided information as to the number of residents at the Compound.
The Larrakia tribe, with 81 residents at the Compound, constituted the majority tribe, closely followed by the 'Waugites' and the Melville Islanders, each with 76 residents.
The next most numerous were the Bathurst Islanders (38), followed by the Mulac Mulac tribe (36), the Anson Bay tribe (30), the Brinkin tribe (18) and the Wool Wonga tribe (2).
325 The Territory submitted that:
 
 'The bias inherent in Ms Wells' theory and methodology ... is emphasised by the following [example].
... Ms Wells asserts that the Committee statistics she quotes show that "the Larrakia continued to predominate" at the Kahlin Compound, a view which was later relied upon to draw further conclusions.
However, what the figures actually show is that while Larrakia people comprised 19.38% of the Compound population, both Waugites and Melville Islanders each comprised 18.8% of the population.
' 
 

326 Mr Hiley cross-examined Dr Wells on this point, suggesting that on the basis of the 1923 figures, Larrakia people did not comprise a 'significant proportion' of the Compound population.
Dr Wells agreed that the data in question indicated that the Larrakia people constituted 20 per cent of the Compound population.
However, she did not agree that the figures tended to suggest generally that at all times 20 per cent of the people at the Compound were Larrakia people.
Dr Wells did not have any other data to suggest that the number of Larrakia people in the Compound was higher than 20 per cent at any other time, and she agreed with Mr Hiley that the percentage would not have been as high as 50 per cent.
327 The Larrakia people comprised the majority tribe in the Compound, but only just, in 1923.
Dr Wells did not produce data to indicate that the percentage of Larrakia people in the Compound was higher at any other time.
There is ample evidence as to the existence of other tribes in the Compound.
In this context, Dr Wells' reliance on references to 'Aboriginal' corroborees seems misplaced.
There is evidence to indicate that Larrakia people were involved in ceremonies at the Compound, but it does not suggest that Larrakia people only did so, or that the nature of those corroborees reflected any particular feature of Larrakia cultural practices distinct from those of other Aboriginal groups at Kahlin.
I also think Dr Wells' cross-examination on this topic is another example of her preparedness to read into certain material things favourable to her opinion which were not really justified by that material.
There is in reality nothing to support the suggestion that for any significant period Larrakia people comprised more than about 20% of the population at Kahlin Compound.
328 I note that at the hearing, applicant witnesses gave evidence of having been present for corroborees at the Kahlin compound when they were young.
Barbara Mills gave evidence of having watched the corroborees from the top of the cliffs, as well as from on the beach.
JF stated that corroborees had been held on Sundays, and on 'special other days like a death or any happy day'.
329 Dr Wells relied on the Koolpinyah station journals, which referred to the cultural life of the Aboriginal station employees, as well as to their travelling movements and resource collection.
Dr Wells asserted that 'many Aboriginal people who are identified elsewhere in the historical record as Larrakia are recorded either working on or passing through the station.
Such names include King Miranda, Ned, Mac[k], Chooky, Gentle Annie and Alice, Bennedy, Hector, Topsy, Gerrard, Dick, Billy, Topsy, Captain and Fat Jack.
' The first respondent disputed that all of these names cited in the journals represented Larrakia people.
It is useful to cross-reference this list of names with the 1957 roll (the 'Register of Wards' referred to above) and with the nominal rolls of the Humpty Doo and Koolpinyah Stations, taken in the early 1950's.
330 There was only one entry each for the names Mack, Chooky and Bennedy, all of which were recorded in the Register of Wards as being Larrakia people.
King Miranda is cited in various historical sources as being from the Larrakia tribe.
I have discussed the issue of whether Gerrard was a Larrakia person.
331 There were 22 people named Billy listed in the Register of Wards, one of whom 'Billy (Long)' was recorded as a Larrakia man.
He was the only person by that name recorded as being in the Koolpinyah 'Sub-District'.
Further, 'Long Billy', a Larrakia man, was also recorded on the Humpty Doo station Nominal Roll.
Similarly, Fat Jack was recorded on the Koolpinyah station Nominal Roll as a Larrakia man.
I find that references to these two names in the Koolpinyah station journals are references to Larrakia people.
332 There were no entries of Larrakia people by the names of Ned, Gentle Annie, Alice or Dick in the Register of Wards.
There were three people named Hector recorded, one of whom was Larrakia, 13 instances of Topsy, two of whom were Larrakia, and 4 records of Captain, one of whom was Larrakia.
None of these Larrakia people were listed as being resident at the Koolpinyah station.
The evidence is inconclusive as to whether these names in the station journals refer to Larrakia people.
333 The Koolpinyah station journals contain references to Larrakia people moving about the area, and going to and from Darwin.
Larrakia people are referred to as taking a 'spell' for a period of time, and in 1929 it was recorded that Gerrard was gone 'walkabout'.
They also refer to the cultural life of Larrakia station employees.
I have already mentioned Gerrard's trip to the Compound to be made 'Banenigar'.
Corroborees, held both in the Koolpinyah, and in other areas, are referred to.
334 The Koolpinyah station journals also refer to the collection of resources.
In particular, there are numerous references to the collection of geese eggs by Bennedy and Gerrard between 1913 and 1941.
There are also references to Gerrard shooting geese and fishing.
Burning-off was also conducted on the station, with references to Gerrard and Bennedy burning the grass: '3 August 1937 ... Gerrard went footwalk to burn grass at Koorabun, got a good fire going ... 10 August 1937 ... Evan took all here [visitors from Darwin] to Korrabum to see the result of the burning off Gerrard did last week.
Grass beginning to spring.
' 
 
335 According to Dr Wells, there is 'minimal evidence' regarding Aboriginal presence in the East Arm region.
She suggested further archaeological and anthropological investigation is desirable.
Archaeological survey work in the region indicated that there were several shell middens within the East Arm area.
336 A Quarantine Station was built in the area in the 1930's, and the army and air force had bases there during the Second World War.
Three leprosaria were built in the East Arm region at Mud Island (1911), Channel Island (1931) and East Arm (1954).
Aboriginal people formed the majority of patients of these hospitals and archaeological research indicated that there were approximately 150 gravesites on Channel Island.
A 1932 report on the Channel Island Leprosarium stated that some of the patients would be leaving the hospital for a two week 'holiday' at 'various places around the harbour.
' 
 
337 There are no records in evidence which suggest that Larrakia people in particular were resident at the leprosaria referred to above.
338 Dr Wells also asserted that there was 'constant reference in the historical record to Larrakia people moving about their country'.
In relation to the West Arm, Dr Wells referred to the records and correspondence of the Point Charles Lighthouse Keeper.
In May 1894 he requested blankets for approximately 60 Aborigines camped near the Lighthouse who he reported to be 'nearly all Larrakeyahs'.
In 1909 government rations were distributed to approximately 150 Aboriginal people on the West Arm landing, including around 23 'Larrakeeya' people.
In the period after that, the evidence of Larrakia people in this area is scanty.
339 Apart from the oral evidence to which I shall refer shortly, the contemporary material in the period from about 1910 to the start of World War II does not point clearly to the Larrakia people having a continuing strong community practising their traditional laws and customs in the Darwin area including the claim area.
The material points to some elder structure within the Larrakia community, to the ongoing holding of corroborees (apparently in conjunction with other Aboriginal groups both at the Kahlin Compound and elsewhere), and to the conduct of some ceremonies although it more strongly suggests that the conduct of ceremonies had barely persisted.
There is no evidence to suggest that all, or most, of the cultural practices of the Larrakia people which were observed during the latter part of the 19 th Century continued to be practised.
340 Dr Wells' opinion evidence does add to that picture.
As I have said, I have adopted a somewhat circumspect approach to her opinions relating to this period.
I am, however, also mindful of the aphorism: absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.
The first applicants have put forward reasons why, despite the paucity of positive contemporary records showing the continued practices of the panopoly of cultural practices, I should find they continued to be practised.
341 I shall defer my conclusions on those issues until I have recorded my findings and the significant evidence in respect of the respect of period between WW II and the present, and about the contemporary status of the Larrakia cultural practices.
The Period WW II --- 1970 
 
342 As noted, many Aboriginal people were removed from Darwin to Delissaville on Cox Peninsula near the start of the WW II.
There, because of a paucity of rations, Aboriginal people were told by the Superintendent that they would 'have to live off the bush as much as possible [and] that they were to go bush  on to the beaches'.
Some of the residents of Delissaville were members of 'Native patrols', which patrolled the coastal areas from Point Charles to Peron Island, locating wrecked Japanese and Allied planes, conducting searches for missing airmen and planes, and reporting suspicious craft.
343 Aboriginal people who had stayed in Darwin, 'camped in the bush around Knuckeys Lagoon, Howard Springs, Shoal Bay etc'.
Following the beginning of the Japanese bombing of Darwin, these camps were raided at dawn and 'all natives transported to 10 Mile Siding where arrangements had been made for a special train to pick them up that afternoon and convey them to Mataranka.
' Mataranka is 400 kilometres inland from Darwin.
The 'Director of Native Personnel' reported that 'at first the natives resented being sent away but later became reconciled and boarded the train quite voluntarily.
' 
 
344 Douglas Lockwood, in 'Australia's Pearl Harbour, Darwin, 1942' recalled that several Larrakia and Wagait men were employed in Darwin at the time of the first air raid.
George Munggalu told Lockwood that the Larrakia people still in the town held a 'council' meeting on Lameroo beach.
At that meeting, Tommy Imabul, Peter Edwards, Billy Shepherd, Chook-Chook and Bob Secretary resolved to remain in the area, until Patrol Officer Bill Harney persuaded them to remove to Delissaville.
345 Prior to the air raids on Darwin, the majority of people of mixed descent were moved to the southern states of Australia.
Many Larrakia people of mixed descent, including Alice Fejo, Kitty Fejo, and Dedja Batcho were evacuated from Alice Springs to Balaklava, in South Australia.
Lockwood cited the Acting Director of Native Affairs, Vin White's comment that the 'separation of half-caste children from aboriginal mothers in these circumstances, with neither knowing whether they'd ever see the other again, was poignant in the extreme.
' 
 
346 Only five percent of mixed descent people from Darwin had voluntarily elected to be evacuated from the Northern Territory.
Living quarters at Balaclava consisted of an area under a grand stand at a racecourse that was unroofed.
The Administrator of the Northern Territory, C L A Abbott, remarked in a 1944 report on an inspection of the Balaklava facilities that 'I could not help feeling that there was an air of great melancholy and depression in the Race Course Settlement.
The women and their children mostly huddled together in their sleeping quarters and appeared to be most apathetic and not particularly happy.
' In his response to the Administrator's report, Superintendent McCoy stated:
 
 'In regard to melancholia and depression I am of the opinion that nothing will solve this condition whilst evacuees are residing in this State.
They are, by force of circumstances, resigned to remaining here until such time as conditions North will permit of them returning to the districts from which they were removed.
I do not know of one single instance of an evacuee expressing a wish to remain and am continually being asked if I have received any news of when they will be permitted to go back.
' 
 

347 In 1942, the Army established 'Native control settlements' for Aboriginal people of full descent.
A 1945 report which listed the number and the 'tribal affiliation' of Aboriginal people in these settlements showed that there were 12 Larrakia people at the Koolpinyah settlement, 13 Larrakia people at the Adelaide River settlement and 2 Larrakia people at the Manbullo (Katherine) settlement.
No Larrakia people were recorded as being resident at either the Mataranka or the Larrimah settlements.
Mr Hiley suggested to Dr Wells that out of approximately 800 Aboriginal people held at these settlements, only 27 of that number were recorded as being members of the Larrakia tribe.
Dr Wells did not dispute this calculation, indicating that the residents of these settlements came from all over the Northern Territory and did not derive solely from the Darwin region.
348 The anthropologists Ronald and Catherine Berndt recorded data at the settlements on their study of card games played by Aborigines, informed by a Larrakia man, Fred Nadpa, who provided them with Larrakia words and phrases.
In their 1947 article, 'Card Games Among Aborigines of the Northern Territory' (the Berndt article), the Berndts also noted that '[m]ajor ceremonies, related to what is known in the Territory as "Big Sunday", and definitely sacred and religious in intent, were from the outset of Army occupation discouraged ... and in some cases prohibited altogether'.
349 The anthropologist A P Elkin wrote in 1949 that the army settlements had engendered 'Aboriginal solidarity' by which rituals and knowledge were passed on between the different groups forced together.
This is the same process that the Territory alleged was taking place at the Kahlin Compound.
Elkin wrote that Aboriginal people continued to find 'social stimulation and pleasure in their own corroborees', that they observed 'kinship and other social customs'.
He said that despite some 'rearrangement and amalgamation of clan and tribal groupings', a 'specific and functioning social structure' was maintained.
Elkin wrote that 'above all', for Aboriginal people in the Darwin region,
 
 'the ritual life is retained or revived.
This strengthens the authority of the elders, for their power derives from their place in, and knowledge of the secret life ...
Such are aspects of Aboriginal life in and around Darwin after seventy and more years of contact.
One final point will make the trend even clearer.
The Larrakia tribe, which formerly occupied the site of Darwin and the Delissaville Peninsular, had several higher degrees, through which an initiated man passed.
These were thought to be a thing of the past in Baldwin Spencer's year in the region, 1912.
But after forty years they were revived --- and revived as a means of dealing with an aspect of the contact situation.
A couple of men of the Wagaitj-Larrakia group had acted in an anti-social way in Darwin.
Punishment by the Court, with gaol, was not effective, and in any case, the elders and more responsible members of the Delissaville community did, and do not want the Aborigines to have a bad name.
They have therefore revived their Larrakia higher degrees, which are marked by severe discipline and stern moral and social teaching, and which add community responsibility.
' 
 

350 I note that Elkin referred to the revival of Larrakia rituals, 'forty years' after they were 'thought to be a thing of the past'.
351 Dr Wells referred to the report of Patrol Officer Gordon Sweeney, 'Some Notes on the Northern Territory with Special Reference to the Future of Aborigine and Mixed Blood'.
Sweeney considered in his 'Notes' that the period immediately after the conclusion of the war would be a 'time of special opportunity for a new vision and a new beginning.
' He considered that a new policy in relation to Aboriginal people of full descent and mixed descent should be developed.
'The conditions under which the evacuated half-castes will return to the North are in our hands.
This is their country, their home, their natural environment, under control and training they have a vital contribution to make to the North.
' Sweeney made other references to 'our responsibilities towards the remnant of the original holders of our country ... [which] call for a determined policy based on an understanding of the realities of the situation', and to '[these people] to whom we owe a sacred duty as their protectors and the occupier of their hunting grounds.
'
 
352 Sweeney also referred to the issue of Aboriginal people from all over the Northern Territory coming to Darwin and what he considered were the consequences of such a convergence: 
 
 'We have opportunities now for planning an effective constructive policy to meet the problem of the drift of natives from outside areas and reserves to Darwin, settlements along the railway and along the overland route, a drift which, if allowed to continue, spells doom to the native people.
' 
 
 'In the N.T.
the natives are fast becoming de-tribalised, they are drifting into the camps and settlements along the overland route, and are decreasing.
Without a far-seeing, constructive and determined policy based on realities, their doom is sealed.
' 
 

353 Frank Moy, the Director of Native Affairs in 1947, argued that people of mixed descent were 'generally deeply embedded in the social structure of Darwin' and that they 'should be offered a place in the community with opportunity equal to any other citizen --- [they are] of the Territory and will still be here when the drifter and opportunist has moved on.
' Moy said that people of mixed descent 'in the new town plan should be catered for under the same conditions as the ordinary basic wage earner.
Whatever scheme is evolved for housing the latter should be available to all citizens.
' This view accorded with the policy of assimilation of people of mixed descent into the white community.
Dr Wells recorded in her report that in 1946 Aboriginal people of mixed descent were allowed to return to Darwin.
On their return Larrakia families were allocated ex-Army huts around Stuart Park.
Children of mixed descent were removed from their Aboriginal mothers and were moved to the Retta Dixon Home, established within the Bagot Reserve.
354 None of this material refers to the Larrakia people specifically.
However, it is relevant in certain respects.
Firstly, Sweeney's Notes demonstrate the notion that the Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory ought to have a special status on the basis of prior occupation of the area.
Secondly, Sweeney's Notes refer to the large numbers of Aboriginal people converging on Darwin from all over the Northern Territory, and the 'de-tribalisation' of the Aborigines in the Northern Territory, resulting from this convergence.
Finally, Moy supported the assimilation policy by which people of mixed descent would gradually be accepted into the white community.
355 The 'Half-caste Association' was formed in Darwin in 1935, by people of mixed descent.
Dr Wells gave evidence that it was an association to promote the interests of people of mixed descent, rather than of Aboriginal people of full descent.
Mr Hughston SC suggested in cross-examination, and Dr Wells agreed, that the members of this association wished to be treated differently from Aboriginal people of full-descent.
As Dr Wells wrote in her report, they were 'seeking freedom from the Aborigines Act which would give them such rights as being able to control their own affairs and destinies.
' 
 
356 In 1951, a second association, the 'Half-caste Progressive Association', was formed with the purpose of pursuing full citizenship rights for people of mixed descent.
The lobbying of this body was successful and changes were made to the definition of 'Aboriginal' and 'part-Aboriginal' people in the new Welfare Ordinance 1953 (NT).
These changes meant that people of mixed descent were able to obtain citizenship, whilst Aboriginal people of full descent became Wards of the State.
People of mixed descent had to abide by regulations in the Aboriginal Ordinance which meant that they were unable to legally mix with Aboriginal people of full descent, including their relatives.
357 In a report dated May 1950, Sweeney detailed the efforts made to keep Aboriginal people out of the town area and mentioned the removal from Mrs Nicoloff's house of two of her 'relatives (full blood aborigines) [who] were camping with her'.
358 The Territory submitted that the formation of these two associations does not evidence any assertion of rights to land on the part of the Larrakia people.
In contrast, it highlights that people of mixed descent wished to distance themselves in a legal sense from Aboriginal people of full descent.
Their successful lobbying resulted in people of mixed descent being unable to legally mix with Aboriginal people of full descent.
The Territory submitted that this result may explain the apparent 'dearth of material in the historical record regarding Larrakia people until the "land rights era".
' 
 
359 In May 1957, an extensive census of the Aboriginal people of full descent in the Northern Territory was published, known as the 'Register of Wards'.
The Register of Wards demonstrates that 1354 Aboriginal people of full descent were recorded in the Darwin region.
Of this number, 38 people were recorded as being members of the Larrakia tribe.
Of 164 Aboriginal people recorded at the East Arm settlement, none were listed as Larrakia.
360 The Register of Wards specified not only the 'Tribe' but also the 'Group' of each person.
As an example, Alfie Miwulaij was listed as being of the 'Larakia' tribe and of the 'Baramandi' group.
Similarly, Hector Larrpina, recorded as Larrakia, was of the 'Fire' group.
However, most Larrakia people were not recorded as being of a particular group.
361 After the war, Aboriginal people of full descent returned to Darwin and were placed in the former RAAF Air Defence Headquarters camp at Berrimah.
The period between the end of the war and the mid 1950's was one of further control over Aboriginal people of full descent juxtaposed by increased agitation on their part.
362 Efforts were made by the Native Affairs Branch of the Northern Territory Administration to control the movement, residence and employment of Aboriginal people.
From the historical sources it is clear that these efforts had a serious impact on the lives of all Aboriginal people in the Darwin area.
The Chief Clerk of the Native Affairs Branch informed the superintendent of Delissaville in January 1947 that 'No native is to be permitted to travel from Darwin to Delissaville unless he has a permit from this office, likewise no native is to be permitted to travel from Delissaville to Darwin unless he has a permit signed by the Superintendent, Delissaville Native Settlement.
' It was compulsory for employers of Aboriginal people to have a particular licence, and if a licence was not produced on demand, then the authorities removed the employee to the Berrimah settlement.
A patrol officer reported in January 1950 that the owner of a canoe found twice on the beach near Doctors Gully had been threatened that 'if it was ever again found on the Darwin side of the harbour, it would be destroyed.
' Dr Wells commented, '[the threat] was [made] ostensibly with the aim of preventing traffic in alcohol.
While this may have been so it would also have prevented Aboriginal people having easy movement about their country for other reasons.
' Dr Wells also referred to reports by patrol officers made in March 1950 and in June 1950.
These three reports illustrate the seriousness attached to the restriction of movement of Aboriginal people about the town area.
363 From the report dated 5 January 1950:
 
 '[O]ver the Christmas and New Year holidays ... [we] conducted several patrols of the Darwin town and environs in an attempt to keep as many natives as possible out of the town area.

 
 We commenced our campaign by warning all natives we met that they must keep off the streets and that they could be arrested for being in town without lawful excuse.
On 27 th December, 1949, we removed a total of 21 natives to Berrimah.
' 
 

364 Similarly, it was recorded in the report dated 27 March 1950 by Patrol Officer J R Ryan that he 'removed between thirtyfive [ sic ] and forty natives from Darwin and its environs to Berrimah.
' Further, Ryan noted that:
 
 'All employers of natives living in the town have not yet been advised by me that their aboriginal employees must not wander aimlessly about the town.
However, most of their employees have been warned that they are not to be on the streets after the departure of the last Berrimah truck.
If they do not co-operate in this matter they have been threatened that they will have to live at Berrimah Settlement.
' 
 

365 In a report dated 2 June 1950, Patrol Officer E C Evans stated that he had 'made a point of constantly reminding natives that they must keep out of Darwin or off the streets at night and it is evident that these warnings following upon the patrols of Patrol Officers Sweeney and Ryan and followed up by an occasional journey round the town are having the desired effect.
'
 
366 A member of the Native Affairs Branch, W E Harney, in 'Life Among the Aborigines', wrote of the way that the camps in Darwin were raided at dawn and the people forcibly removed to Garden Point, north of Melville Island, 'where they could be away from Darwin's temptations'.
367 At the same time as the Administration was seeking to increase its control over the Aboriginal people of full descent in the Darwin region, these people were seeking better working conditions and wages.
Dr Wells recorded in her report that in February 1947 one hundred Aboriginal workers, mainly residents at the Berrimah Compound, and generally employed as 'domestics and labourers' said that they would strike until certain demands were met.
This action was not successful.
368 In November 1950, 'all Aborigines resident [at] Berrimah Aboriginal Reserve' informed Sweeney, at that time a Native Affairs Officer, that they 'were on strike and refused to proceed to work.
' Their demands were that their wages be increased and that 'there should be equal laws for whites and aborigines'.
The Northern Territory Administrator, A R Driver, stated that he would not consider any rise in wages, and advised the Director of Native Affairs to 'exercise his powers under section 16 of the Aboriginals Ordinance'.
Section 16 authorised the removal of Aboriginal people to other settlements or institutions when the Director considered it to be in the person's best interests.
369 The Administrator ordered the removal from Darwin of one of the leaders of the strikes, Fred Nadpur, under s 16 of the Ordinance.
In 1981, Patrol Officer Evans recounted:
 
 'the Administrator, Mick Driver, decided to take a hard line and he directed the removal of the chief leader --- a Larakia leader named Fred Waters, or, to give him his Aboriginal name, Fred Nadpur --- from Darwin to the Haasts Bluff Reserve in Central Australia.
This decision was not of course made publicly and in a cloak and dagger atmosphere I was detailed to pick up Fred from his camp and to head south towards Haasts Bluff.
He joined me quite willingly and apart from expressing some apprehension when he learned his destination, showed no distress or resistance.
... the removal of Fred had the desired effect and the strike ended.
Meanwhile Fred, who had an initial fear of the desert Aboriginal, being convinced they all had three toes "all-the-same Emu", had adjusted to his new environment to the point that at the end of his six weeks exile he was beginning to rouse the Haasts Bluff folk to industrial action ....' 
 

370 Fred Nadpur, as mentioned above, was reported as having been elected King of the Larrakia tribe at Delissaville in 1954.
He was also referred to in the Berndt article.
Both Annie Risk and Barbara Mills Raymond referred to Fred Nadpur in their oral evidence: Annie Risk said that she had been told stories about 'Grandpa Nadpur', and Barbara Mills Raymond said she remembered him as her uncle, and that she would go walkabout with him and other people.
371 Other attempts to obtain better wages and working conditions were made in 1951 and 1952.
Dr Wells reported that Aboriginal people involved with strike action were threatened with the cessation of their food rations.
In the context of the wages actually received by these people --- since a 'significant portion' was automatically deposited into the Aboriginal Trust Account from whence it could not be withdrawn without permission --- this form of 'persuasion' was compelling.
372 The Territory submitted, in my view correctly, that the Aboriginal people's efforts to obtain better working conditions and wages are not evidence of any assertion of rights to land by the Larrakia people.
However, the evidence that Fred Nadpur was one of the leaders of the strikes is to be given weight when considered in conjunction with the other evidence outlined above concerning his position in the Larrakia tribe as an elder.
Larrakia Land Claims 
 
373 Towards the end of the 1950's, there was debate over the proposed removal of the Bagot Aboriginal Reserve further away from the town.
In the Northern Territory Legislative Council, the Director of Welfare, Harry Giese, argued against this removal, saying:
 
 'It ought to be known to members that the tribal group that occupied the area over which the Darwin town area now extends was called the Larrakeah group.
We have still in Darwin remnants of that very proud group of people and they are still located in their tribal area in the city of Darwin.
... of the 270 odd natives resident on Bagot, some 200 belong to that group of people and this is their tribal area.
Are we going to suggest now, Mr President, that they should be dispossessed?
' 

374 Five years later, in 1964, the land on which the Bagot Reserve was situated was resumed and another, smaller, area was proclaimed the new Bagot Aboriginal Reserve.
Kulaluk Land Claim 
 
375 In the early 1970s, the Larrakia people lodged an application with the Lands and Survey Branch for a lease to the land around the Kulaluk waterhole.
On 27 May 1971, the Northern Territory News reported that there were 'now only about 20 [Larrakia people] left [in Darwin]' but that 'there are a fair number of part-Larrakia people living in Darwin'.
The article quoted Bobby Secretary, who stated his reasons for the claim:
 
 'It has been a special place for our people for all time .... We want to keep what is left, and we want to live there.
We don't like Bagot.
There are too many people, and too much trouble with fights that get the place a bad name.
Bagot should be kept for Aboriginals, but the Larrakia should be given the rest of Kulaluk.
We do have other special places.
One is the frog cave at Casuarina, where water from a frog drips all the time.
People who put their hands in the water can injure their lives.
There is also Morramajuk at Shoal Bay, where our people caught crabs.
The Vernon Islands are ours.
They were given to me by my father.
... And there is a waterfall at a place we call Balyun near Delisaville.
At Parap we had a spring of fresh water we called Kilaworro.
Now it is completely covered, and underneath a big water tank.
... All our places are gone or in danger of disappearing.
We want to tell Mr Giese about Kulaluk, and ask him to save it for us.
Although there are not many Larrakia left, there are a fair number of part-Larrakia people living in Darwin.
' 
 

376 The Territory drew attention to the three other sites --- the frog cave at Casuarina, Morramajuk at Shoal Bay, and the spring at Parap --- noting that the evidence about these sites during the hearing was limited.
Its observation is correct, although as discussed below there was some emphasis on the frog cave.
377 Bill Risk proffered the only evidence in relation to the site at Parap, saying that he had been told by his 'aunty' that there was a spring there that Larrakia people could drink from, and that it was a 'site of significance'.
The significance of his evidence must be weighed with the fact that none of the other witnesses referred to it.
378 There was no reference to 'Morramajuk' in either these proceedings or in the Kenbi Claim.
However, during these proceedings, Lorraine Williams said that 'Murrumujuk' was the name for the beach area along the Gunn Point area, which is to the north of Shoal Bay.
Tibby Quall also referred to Murrumujuk, in passing, but did not specify the area covered.
379 Bill Risk, Kenny Reid, Pauline Baban, Helen Secretary, Maureen Ogden, Joe Raymond and Tibby Quall gave evidence at the hearing in relation to 'frog dreaming'.
Susan Roman gave evidence on this topic at the Kenbi Claim in 1995.
Out of these eight witnesses, six knew the location of the frog dreaming, near the Dripstone caves at Casuarina beach.
There were varying descriptions of the significance of the site, with Pauline Baban and Helen Secretary warning against drinking the water or playing in the area.
Helen said that the frog dreaming 'watches over where Old Man Rock is'.
None of the other witnesses raised either of these points.
Similarly, Tibby Quall, Maureen Ogden and Pauline Baban were the only witnesses to give evidence of a 'frog song'.
No witness gave evidence as to water that drips all the time at the site.
380 Evidence was also led as to the name of the dreaming, the type and the number of frog dreamings.
Bill Risk said that the dreaming was called 'Nadpa'.
Maureen Ogden said that the Larrakia name for frog was Ngartbangartba, but said she did not know the name of that particular frog.
Helen Secretary called the dreaming Gulparla.
A possible explanation for the use of two names was provided by Tibby Quall who gave evidence that there are in fact two sites at the Dripstone caves.
There is 'Ngarba frog dreaming' --- a brown saltwater frog with three eyes --- and 'Gulpa-la' frog dreaming --- a green frog.
Likewise, Pauline Baban referred to 'two frogs', being Ngartpa ngartpa, and Guparla, as did Kenny Reid, although he did not specify their names.
Susan Roman referred to 'two-headed frog dreaming'.
Tibby Quall's evidence is consistent with the evidence of Bill Risk and Helen Secretary: Bill Risk said that the dreaming was a saltwater frog with three eyes, named Nadpa, and Helen Secretary said the dreaming was a 'big green frog', and called it Gulparla.
381 The article also named Lawrence Urban and Norman Harris as the 'leaders' of the Larrakia people.
The first respondent referred to the historical source describing a strike by Aboriginal people in Darwin in 1950 --- referred to above --- and the Register of Wards to demonstrate that Lawrence Urban was a member of the Wagait tribe, a fact which was acknowledged by Dr Wells in her report.
As for Norman Harris, his wife, Topsy Secretary, gave evidence at the Kenbi Claim hearing that he was Larrakia.
Evidence was given in the Kenbi hearing that Norman Harris' Aboriginal name was Barral.
In the current proceedings, Lena Henry gave evidence that Norman Barral (Harris) is 'from Wagait' but she said that she did not know much about 'that one'.
The Register of Wards lists 'Norman Baral' as from the Larrakia tribe.
Given Topsy Secretary's evidence and the historical evidence, I find that Norman Barral was a member of the Larrakia tribe.
382 An article entitled 'The camp at Kulaluk', published in the Northern Territory News on 15 June 1971, reported that members of the Larrakia tribe had established a permanent camp at Kulaluk to 'strengthen their claim for land there.
' Bobby Secretary is quoted as expressing the hope that 'all surviving members of the tribe would go to live there', and that there were 'probably 25 to 30 Larrakias left'.
The article reported that nine people were already camped at Kulaluk.
383 Bill Day, a non-Aboriginal supporter of the claim, informed the public about the progress of the claim in the news sheet 'Bunji' (referred to above), between 1971 and 1984.
An association was established.
The origin of the name of the association, 'Gwala Daraniki', is the subject of conflicting evidence.
In 1989, Topsy Secretary gave evidence that 'Gwala Daraniki' meant 'our land' in Larrakia.
In the current proceedings, Helen Secretary likewise gave evidence that 'Gwala Daraniki' meant 'our country', however, she said that a Queensland man, Fred Fogerty, had suggested it.
384 On 9 July 1971 the Larrakia people commemorated National Aborigines Day by marching to the Northern Territory Administration block on Mitchell Street from Kulaluk.
The Northern Territory News reported that 'the march was also aimed at drawing attention to the tribe's claim on the camping site and waterhole off Coconut Grove.
... Mr [Bobby] Secretary said that though there were no indications that anyone intended evicting the tribe from Kulaluk, they would like some formal acknowledgement that it was their's so they could not be asked to leave later.
' Approximately 13 men, women and children took part in the march, including Bill Day.
Bobby Secretary said that some of the Larrakia people wished to 'travel to Delissaville so we could sort out the legal situation with Mr Tommy Lyons who knows the area very well'.
The Territory in its written submissions highlighted the fact that few, if any, of the 'fair number of part-Larrakia people living in Darwin' participated in the march.
Further, the Territory submitted that the fact that Bobby Secretary said that they needed to see Tommy Lyons 'who knows the area very well', 'indicates a lack of knowledge of country on the part of the Larrakia people in Darwin.
' 
 
385 Larrakia people and their supporters also participated in sit down protests on Bagot Road during peak hour traffic, to publicise their claim.
The Northern Territory News dated 5 October 1971 recorded that 
 
 'About 20 Aboriginal men, women and children sat on Bagot Road yesterday blocking traffic as part of their campaign to win rights to land ... .
The Aboriginals, Larrakias, Brinkin and Wargite, were supporting the fight by a handful of Larrakias for the land.
... About six Larrakias are camped in time shanties and tents on the land.
The Administration recently refused them the land, and yesterday morning's sit-down was a planned protest against the decision.
...
The Aboriginals were also angry at the number of people struck and killed by cars outside the Bagot Reserve.
' 
 

386 A report by the District Welfare Officer dated 6 October 1971, regarding the protest, stated that only some of the people involved in the protest said that it was to draw attention to the Larrakia people claiming land rights.
Others interviewed said that it was 'Union business' or to 'cut down speeding on Bagot Road'.
However, at a meeting at Kulaluk between Patrol Officer J K Doolan and Bobby Secretary following the protest, it was 'established definitely that the main, and as far as the Larrakia group was concerned, the only reason behind the protest was to draw the attention of the public to the Larrakias claim for land.
' Doolan further reported to the District Welfare Officer:
 
 'Yesterday was the first time for some months that the writer has visited the Larrakia camp, and it was impossible not to appreciate Mr Secretary and his people's concern.
Much of the quite attractive jungle country has been laid waste by bulldozers and many of the trees which afforded good possum hunting are gone.
Part of the creek has been filled in to make way for what appears to be the inevitable road making and housing development in a comparatively [ sic ] small area, whilst on the other side of Bagot Road lies the vast area controlled by the R.A.A.F.
The question could be asked, "why don't they go to Bagot?
", but the point is that they do not want to go to Bagot, and at this stage are determined not to.
' 
 

387 Further sit-down protests at Bagot Road were held on 1 November 1971, and 23 November 1971.
At the former, 29 people, seven of who were Larrakia people, including Bobby Secretary and his nephew Johnny Fejo, participated.
Approximately 15 people attended the latter.
On 8 November 1971, it was reported in the Northern Territory Times that a group of 5 Larrakia people had raised a flag to the top of the pole outside the Supreme Court, to 'claim Darwin back for the Aboriginal people'.
All of these activities were reported to have been led by Bobby Secretary.
In October 1972, a group of Aboriginal people camped outside of Government House, wishing to present a land rights petition, containing 1000 signatures, to Princess Margaret, who was touring Australia at the time.
There was no indication in the article that any Larrakia people had signed the petition.
Previously, in March that year, the Larrakia people had sent the Prime Minister a petition containing 1000 signatures, requesting that the Government to appoint a Commission to approach every Aboriginal group to negotiate separate tailored treaties.
During cross-examination, Dr Wells said that only five Larrakia men had signed the treaty.
388 Dr Wells agreed with Mr Hughston's suggestion that a characteristic of the land rights protests in the early 1970's was that a very small number of Larrakia people were involved.
Dr Wells said that she had focused on the fact that the Larrakia people were asserting their rights to land, rather than on the number of people participating in the demonstrations.
Mr Hughston further suggested that it was significant that the historical record demonstrated that only a very small group of Larrakia people identified themselves as 'Larrakia' during this period, whilst the current applicant group is comprised of approximately 1200 members, of both full descent and mixed descent.
Dr Wells said that during the 1970's land rights era there was clearly a small band of full-descent Aboriginal people who identified themselves as 'Larrakia'.
In contrast, there is nothing in the historical record to indicate whether or not there were people of mixed descent who also identified themselves as members of the Larrakia tribe.
The Territory in its written submissions submitted that people of mixed descent were not motivated to become involved in any attempts by the Larrakia people to regain their land.
Indeed it is noteworthy that the historical record shows that people of mixed descent did not participate in any of the demonstrations outlined above.
389 The Territory submitted that at this point in time few people considered themselves to be 'Larrakia', and that there were not many people considered by the community to be 'Larrakia'.
390 An investigation by the Northern Territory Administration into the land claim at Kulaluk refused the Larrakia people's application in September 1971.
In a report entitled 'Traditional Camping Area, Nightcliff --- Known as Kulaluk', W Gray, a 'project officer', advised the Administration that the Kulaluk site was no longer of ceremonial significance to Aboriginal people.
It is useful to set out part of the report as follows:
 
 'A group of Aboriginals referring to themselves as Larrakeyah people approached the Welfare Division in 1971 seeking assistance in obtaining official permission for them to live beside this waterhole.
They claimed the site as a traditional camping ground and expressed concern that town development would encroach upon and eventually obliterate the site.
At that stage the leader of the group Mr. Bobby Secretary was not well versed in the traditional significance of the site and said that he would be getting more information on this from older people including a Mr. Tom Lyons who resides at Delissaville.

 
 [...] 
 
 Mr. Tom Lyons travelled from Delissaville to Darwin for the purpose of discussing the significance of the site known as Kulaluk with Mr. Bobby Secretary, Norman Harris and others who at present were claiming ownership of that particular area.
Mr. Lyons visited the site and the following day came to this office to discuss the matter.
The following is a report of what Mr. Lyons told me regarding the site known as Kulaluk.

 
 The site was indeed at one time regarded by members of the Larrakeyah tribe as an area of some significance.
Kulaluk referred to a continually running spring which is now in fact a small waterhole ... .
This waterhole still exists and is fed by the same spring.

 
 Mr. Lyons remembers that on approximately three or four occasions ceremonies (circumcision?
) were held at this particular site.
The area was taboo to women and uninitiated males and was also avoided by the Larrakeyah people.
From my discussion it would appear that Kulaluk was a ceremonial ground of some importance.
Asked whether or not the ground still held that same significance, Mr. Lyons was adamant in that due to the fact that women and uninitiated persons have camped on the site, the area can no longer be regarded as being special.

 
 [...] 
 
 Mr. Lyons indicated that he had no intention or wish to return to Kalaluk [ sic ] and gave me to understand that the area was not regarded as a camping ground.
He did indicate, however, that as the people who had connections with Larrakeyah were now camping there, he had no objections if they continued to do so.
So far as he was concerned, the area was no longer of any significance.

 
 [...] 
 
 Summarising, it would appear to me that we have a group of people with many tribal affiliations squatting near a small waterhole which at one time or another had certain significance to members of the Larrakeyah tribe.
The importance of the area diminished along with the decreased in numbers of that particular tribe and with the advent of various people, both male and female camping in that area.
I would say: 
 
 
 (a) that it would be very difficult to estimate the numbers of Aboriginals who have traditionally used the site as a camping area.
I would suggest that any Aboriginal who knew the significance of that area would never have used the site as a camping area; consequently I feel that it would be wrong to say that the area was ever a traditional camping area.
Certainly with the passing of time the area would have become a convenient spot of reset and replenish for those who were not aware of the traditional significance of the site.

 
 
 [...] 
 
 
 (b) as to whether or not the waterhole and its immediate environs form any part of the Aboriginal myth, story or song, I can only repeat that Mr. Lyons regarded the area as a site where a certain ceremony was performed and that the site itself was taboo to all women, children and uninitiated males.
These taboos have long since been violated and consequently Mr. Lyons regards the place as having no significance.
' 
 
 

391 The determination of the Northern Territory Administration was reported on 9 September 1971 in the Northern Territory News.
That article reported that the '15 or so remaining Larrakia prefer to live [at Kulaluk] than at Bagot reserve' and that the Administration had rejected the claim on the basis that 'it was no longer of ceremonial significance' because 'women and uninitiated people now had access to the region'.
The article also observed that the Administration had said that 'only one of the remaining families could be traced definitely as Larrakia.
' In the article Bobby Secretary said that he was disappointed in the Administration's decision, and that if the Administration wanted them to move from Kulaluk, compensation should be paid.
Bobby Secretary also stated that he did not want to remove to Bagot, because of 'trouble and inter-tribal hostility', nor to Delissaville: 'I am Darwin born and bred ... and I want to die here.
'
 
392 The Territory in its written submissions suggested that the land claims were made by Bobby Secretary, for the 'remaining members of the tribe', rather than by the 'Larrakia people'.
I reject this submission on the basis that there is evidence that other Larrakia people of full descent participated in the land claims.
Bobby Secretary was simply the public leader of the group, as attested to by the various newspaper articles of the time.
393 In 1995 Topsy Secretary provided information to Mark Harvey, a linguist, in relation to the continuing cultural importance of the Kulaluk site concerning a particular dreaming.
As the detail of that dreaming is in a document to which access is restricted, I shall not detail it.
It was included in Dr Wells' report.
Mr Hiley for the DCC challenged Dr Wells in relation to the reliance she placed on source material, suggesting that Dr Wells relied less on the information provided by Tommy Lyons than on that provided by Bobby Secretary and Topsy Secretary.
Mr Hiley suggested this reliance was misplaced, considering that Bobby Secretary had deferred to Tommy Lyons in relation to traditional matters.
Dr Wells responded that she had given more weight to 'the people who were resident on the land', indicating that whilst Bobby Secretary and Topsy Secretary lived in the Kulaluk region, Tommy Lyons lived at Belyuen.
Again, however, it is noteworthy that in cross-examination, Dr Wells agreed that she could not recall seeing any reference to a significant cultural site existing at Kulaluk before the 1970's.
394 The Territory also submitted more generally that the cultural knowledge held by Larrakia people was limited, as evidenced by Bobby Secretary's reliance on Tommy Lyons Imabul.
I deal with the issue of the Larrakia people's level of cultural knowledge during this period below.
395 Justice Woodward, a Federal Court judge, was commissioned on 8 February 1973 to conduct an inquiry into the 'appropriate means to recognise and establish the traditional rights and interests of the Aborigines in and in relation to land, and to satisfy in other ways the reasonable aspirations of the Aborigines to rights in or in relation to land.
' Justice Woodward was assisted by Dr Nicholas Peterson, an eminent Australian anthropologist.
He visited Kulaluk in 1973 and subsequently prepared two reports: 'Aboriginal Land Rights Commission: First Report', in July 1973, and 'Aboriginal Land Rights Commission: Second Report', in April 1974.
The Second Report formed the basis of a Bill on Aboriginal land rights.
396 As part of his meetings with people in Darwin and at Kulaluk, Justice Woodward met with Patrol Officer Jeremy Long, who informed his Honour that the Kulaluk claim 'is regarded as the strongest traditional land claim in Australian towns.
'
 
397 In his First Report, Justice Woodward observed in relation to the Kulaluk claim:
 
 'A more difficult question is raised by the few remaining members of the Larrakia tribe who, in discussion with me, have laid claim particularly to an area of waterfront land between Bagot and Nightcliff which they call Kulaluk.
When I met them I was told that there are some 18 members of the tribe now left.
Later information suggests that fewer than this number can trace paternal descent from the Larrakia, but there are more who identify themselves as Larrakia because of maternal links.
They have told me that the whole of Darwin is built on Larrakia country and written claims submitted on their behalf include claims to several parts of the city, the Larrakeyah Reserve of 11/2 square miles south of Darwin and 660 acres of land in Darwin to replace land excised from the Bagot Reserve in 1965.

 
 [...] 
 
 The Larrakia group raise some special problems.
Clearly they are entitled to consideration as a group wanting to live as a small community and to do so on some part of the traditional lands of their tribe.

 
 Whether they should be free to choose the particular site in a developing city such as Darwin raises different questions.
One question is the length and extent of their attachment to the area in question; it may have belonged to a different clan of their tribe.
' 
 

398 Justice Woodward in his second report repeated his observations about the Larrakia people, adding that the Department of Aboriginal Affairs survey showed 'a total of 28 Aborigines who identify themselves as Larrakia, of whom 17 live in Darwin.
' His Honour further stated:
 
 'I have no doubt that the Larrakia people were the traditional owners of what is now the whole Darwin area.
Some of the survivors, together with a few other Aborigines, have formed an organization calling itself Gwala Daraniki.
The secretary of this organization, a white man, has achieved remarkable results in obtaining press coverage and other forms of publicity for the claims of this group.
In the result, Kulaluk has become something of a symbol of the stand which Aborigines, with help and guidance from many different sources, are now making against the past tendency to put their interests last in any consideration of land usage.

 
 It is true that only a small number of Aborigines have camped regularly at Kulaluk in recent years, but the publicity their case has received has been sufficient to cause the Government to step in and half the further development of the area as a residential sub-division, until at least the making of this report.
' 
 

399 Justice Woodward advised that the Government should acquire the vacant land at Kulaluk for 'Aboriginal living purposes, paying the necessary compensation to those whose interests in the land would be extinguished by such acquisition.
' His Honour considered that this action would demonstrate the 'Government's willingness to give effect to reasonable Aboriginal aspirations to land' and be 'entirely consistent with the general principles set out above'.
Justice Woodward also counselled that the title 'should be the same as applies to other members of the urban community --- in this case, leasehold.
I say this ... because I do not believe traditional ownership in the sense in which that expression is used throughout this report, could be established in Darwin'.
The Territory relied on this statement, as well as on his Honour's use of past tense in saying that the Larrakia people ' were the traditional owners'.
400 His Honour came to the conclusion that there were very few remaining members of what he described as the Larrakia tribe.
It was agreed between the parties to the current proceedings that Justice Woodward used the term 'traditional owner' in the sense of a Larrakia person of patrilineal full-descent.
401 Justice Ward was appointed Interim Aboriginal Land Commissioner in April 1975, and held a public inquiry into the Kulaluk claim before the land rights legislation had been ratified.
His report, published on 23 June 1975, recommended that a Special Purpose Lease be granted in perpetuity 'for the purpose of establishing, developing and maintaining a communal settlement for the use of the Larrakia and other associated Aboriginal people and ancillary purposes.
' 
 
402 Various factors contributed to the long delay in granting the Kulaluk Special Purpose Lease to the Larrakia people.
One such factor was the construction of a major road through the land.
District Adviser J K Doolan was requested to report on any Aboriginal burial sites in the area.
Doolan was escorted by Victor Williams, a Larrakia man, who advised him that 'there could be as many as two hundred people buried there'.
Doolan also collected information in relation to the ancestors of the Larrakia people whose names were listed beside a map of the Kulaluk claim painted on the outside wall of a house at Kulaluk.
Such names included Bobby Secretary, Prince of Wales, Topsy Kurramanak, Dolly Gurinyi, Topsy Secretary, Harriet Ababa, Gabriel Secretary, Imabul Tommy Lyons, Barral Norman Harris, Olga Lyons, Johnny Fejo, Kathy Secretary, Captain Bishop and Victor Williams.
Doolan concluded, 'This would give a total of 7 people who are full Larrakia, 3 who could claim to be Larrakia through the maternal line, and 4 who could claim to be Larrakia through the paternal line.
'
 
403 The Kulaluk Special Purpose Lease was granted to the Larrakia people on 25 August 1979.
Chief Minister Paul Everingham presented the title to Bobby Secretary, stating '[t]he land on which Darwin is situated belonged to the Larrakia before the white man first came to the Northern Territory, and now Mr Bobby Secretary is to receive the title to part of their land.
' Topsy Secretary is reported in the Northern Territory News dated 27 August 1979 as having said 'I'm really proud of it.
This is the land our fathers left us.
'
 Gundal Land Claim 
 
404 In the early 1970's the Larrakia people lodged a land claim over the men's ceremonial site 'Gundal' on Point Emery, in the vicinity of the Larrakeyah Army Barracks.
405 In May 1973, the Northern Territory News reported that a group of Larrakia people, including Dolly Gurinyi, Victor Williams, Bobby Secretary, Captain Bishop and Norman Harris, had inspected the Larrakeyah Army Barracks for the purposes of collecting information to present to Justice Woodward.
The article recorded that Dolly said that 'it has been a long, long time' as she 'looked out over Emery Point, known to her people in earlier times as Gundalwa --- their most sacred ceremonial ground.
' The group 'identified Emery Point as one of the tribe's most sacred ceremonial grounds and another area, near squadron headquarters, Matlamanning, as a second tribal site.
' The article further stated that Dolly Gurinyi was 'one of a handful of Aboriginals who claim to be the remaining members of the Larrakia tribe', and that it had been 50 years since Dolly had 'set foot on the area which was once her home'.
The group of Larrakia people had to wait six months before being permitted to enter the reserve, and said that 'by rights they could have asked for "free access rights" to their old ceremonial grounds, but that they had gone through the same channels as others.
'
 
406 Visits were made to Gundal in June and July 1975 by Bill Day, Barral Norman Harris, Tommy Imabul, Sam Fejo and George Munggalu.
Dr Wells reported that George Munggalu had 'stressed the importance of the site and wanted it made into "nice country again" with access by women restricted.
' In contrast, in an unpublished 'Report on sites of significance in the Larrakeyah Barracks --- Emery Point area' by Michael Walsh (Walsh's report), it was recorded that:
 
 'George Munggalu on a trip to Gundal on 22 May 1981 ... pointed out that now it was alright for Aboriginal women and children to go right to the end of the point but "not before".

 
 [...] 
 
 All Aborigines I spoke to appeared to be keen to have access to the site.
... Topsy Secretary wanted to see a fence put up.
... No other Aborigines I spoke to gave a clear indication that they wanted anything more than limited access.
In fact George Munggalu, ceremonial leader, stated that the area, whilst important in the past, was now open to anyone including Aboriginal women and children.
' 
 

407 Dr Wells in cross-examination said that she had relied on an interview transcript between Bill Day and George Munggalu, taken on 1 July 1975, during which George Munggalu was asked, 'Do you want that land [Gundal] to be for you people again?
' George Munggalu responded, 'Yes we want it, that very important to us, you leave it alone, just make it park, no women there, make it nice country again.
' The Territory noted that that interview took place approximately six years before the visit to Gundal in 1981, reported by Dr Walsh.
408 In another interview between Bill Day, Tommy Imabul and Sam Fejo, it was decided between Tommy Imabul and Sam Fejo that the latter would remain outside the ceremony place, because he was 'not allowed in that place'.
Tommy Imabul then showed Bill Day where 'men's business' had taken place, explained the roles taken on by various people, and said that 'You tell that government no building here'.
409 Victor Williams, in a written statement annexed to Walsh's report, recounted:
 
 'in the old days Goondal use to be the ceremony ground for initiations and that was out of bounds to young people.
I remember well those days.
I was eight or nine and mum was a Larrakia.
Women folk and younger people had to stand well away, you see the men but only a ring of people.
... Aunty Dolly, she began to cry when we visited Goondal last year because it was the first time she put her foot on the ground there.
In her younger days she wasn't allowed.
...
When the Army took over the ceremonies stopped.
' 
 

410 Topsy Secretary, in her written statement annexed to Walsh's report, said that her father had given the area to the Army because it was 'better than married people because army men won't let women to go near Goondal so much.
' Norman Harris Barral recounted:
 
 'We was playing down Cullen Beach all young boy.
After that old men make a Sunday Corrobbree [ sic ] and we all went to Sunday business.
Climb up on top of hill.
After that we sit down there --- people bring food --- not for boys for old people.
Three months lock up native way for boys at Goondal.
Not clothes, no women allowed.
Army wasn't there, scrub.
No white people allowed to see all naked boy.
Old men give us hiding from stick and all that, teach us law.
...
Even police can't come, old people stop them before.
When finished we paint up and go down to women.
White people stop us, not to do anymore.
... We not using that place any more, too many ladies everybody walking around, no scrub everyone can see.
We can't have business where lot of people around.
... We like to have Goondal for Aborigines people, any tribe.
' 
 

411 Norman Harris Barral also said that 'Another place ... Two Fella Creek, thats business place we call Daramungamunie.
We go with canoe from Goondal.
' Dr Wells referred to this as highlighting the alleged shift of the ceremony from the Point Emery region to across the harbour.
I deal with this material further later in these reasons.
412 Dr Wells agreed that the historical records demonstrate that the Gundal area ceased to be used as a ceremonial site from between 1927 and 1933, when the military base was established.
413 Justice Ward, the Interim Aboriginal Land Commissioner, recommended that the Gundal area be granted in perpetuity as a Special Purpose Lease and that the purpose of the lease be for the use of the Larrakia and associated Aboriginal people as a sacred, ceremonial and traditional site and for ancillary purposes.
414 Justice Ward, referring to a plan of the site, said:
 
 'The claim is in respect of the land as a sacred, ceremonial and traditional site and I have no doubt that historically this can be and is substantially supported.
... Line "A" [on the plan] is a line beyond which women were not permitted to go.
Line "B" is a line to which food was brought by the women and left for those participating in the ceremonies.
Line "D" is a line beyond which children were not permitted to go.
' 
 

415 The plan of the site was included in Walsh's report.
Line 'A' is on the point itself.
The Territory relied on Ward J's use of past tense when describing where the women were not permitted to go.
There was conflicting evidence given in both the current proceedings and the Kenbi Claim as to whether women were allowed inside the gates of the Larrakeyah Barracks at all.
Helen Secretary, Barbara Raymond, Yula Williams and JF gave evidence that women could not enter the Larrakeyah Barracks.
Victor Williams and Maureen Ogden gave evidence that women could go into the Barracks, but not up onto the point.
Victor Williams in his statement annexed to Walsh's report said that Dolly Gurinyi, his aunt, had cried when she first visited Gundal because 
 
 'it was the first time she put her foot on the ground there.
In her younger days she wasn't allowed.
... Aunty ... use to be a cook with the Australian Women's Auxiliary Service and in charge of the employment for girls working in the barracks.
But she didn't go to the point even then.
...
When the Army took over the ceremonies stopped.
The ceremony ground comes from the point right to the Sergeants Mess.
The Sergeants Mess is on the line where the women folk used to stand.
' 
 

416 The Territory challenged Dr Well's reliance on Walsh's report in relation to the land claim at Gundal, on the basis that, since Dr Walsh also co-authored the claim book in the first Kenbi Claim, it was self-serving evidence.
In Allied Interstate (Qld) Pty Limited v Barnes [1968] HCA 76 ; (1968) 118 CLR 581 at 585, Barwick CJ said that the weight of self-serving statements is a matter for the Court.
Further, Barwick CJ said that while the weight accorded to self-serving statements may not always be great, where such a statement is made under exposure of immediate checking and under penalty for falsity it is 'impossible not to give it any weight'.
Dr Walsh as an expert witness was under a duty to the Court.
Further, in his report, relied on by Dr Wells, Dr Walsh specified his sources of information.
In these circumstances, I propose to give some weight to his report.
417 Due to the construction of the Army barracks at Emery Point, the ceremonies were discontinued at Gundal at some point between 1927 and 1933.
A few years later the Kahlin Compound ceased to exist.
418 In Walsh's report, referred to by Dr Wells, Dr Walsh cited a 1936 report to the Administrator by W B Kirkland, the Chief Protector of Aborigines of the time, that the ceremonies had been transferred to a more isolated location on the Cox Peninsula:
 
 'It was gleaned that ceremonial centres in the vicinity of Darwin had been abandoned for several years and that initiation ceremonies were now conducted some five miles from Darwin, entailing a voyage across the harbour by canoe ...'.

 

419 Dr Walsh also recorded that a Limilngan man, Felix Holmes, had identified two Larrakia ceremonial sites: Bilurrgwa on Shoal Bay and Mayilmilma near Bankey's Jungle, where people from all groups in the area participated.
Felix Holmes said that:
 
 'If you had put a tape on the ceremony ground at Oenpelli and you had taken another tape at Daramanggamaning (a ceremonial site on the north coast of the Cox Peninsula), it would have been the same.
' 
 

420 Dr Walsh further recorded that 'Holmes also stated that the ceremonies shift to Darwin, presumably meaning Gundal, and then to Daramanggamaning after the site became unsuitable through the presence of the army barracks.
' According to Walsh's report, 
 
 'Frank Secretary, Tommy Lyons Imabulg, King George, Billy Minyinma all participated in ceremonies at Gundal ... .
Since the ceremonies have been transferred to other ceremonies those who have participated in the same kind of ceremonies performed at Gundal include: Nipper Rankin, Johnny Biyanamu, Roy Madbulg, Tommy Barradjab, Felix Holmes, George Munggalu, Norman Harris, Captain Bishop.
' 
 
 Land Claim over Dariba Nunggalinya 
 
421 The Larrakia people lodged a land claim over Dariba Nungalinya, known as 'Old Man Rock' around the same time as the Kulaluk and Gundal land claims were lodged.
Previously, in 1931 the Northern Territory Times had reported on an earth tremor in Darwin, recording that a 'Larrakeeyah native' insisted that the tremor occurred
 
 'because a certain King God turned over in his sleep.
According to this informant there is a large stone or rock situated close to Casuarina Beach (is it Old Man Rock?
) and reached by the tides at certain times.
This rock is or was the First Aboriginal and the maker or beginner of the aboriginals of Australia.

 
 This king god sleeps near Casuarina Beach and occasionally when disturbed turns over in his sleep causing the whole earth to shake with his movements.
' 
 

422 The Adelaide Advertiser had published a similar article in 1931 referring to 'a large stone close to the sea' at Casuarina, believed to be 'the King God, the first aborigine and creator of all others'.
423 Dr Wells agreed with Mr Hughston in cross-examination that only one Larrakia person is referred to in the article in the Northern Territory Times as a source.
Mr Hughston also suggested that the description of the 'large stone or rock situated close to Casuarina Beach ... and reached by the tides at certain times' does not accord with the current location of Old Man Rock, which sits 'several hundred yards out to sea'.
Dr Wells agreed that an inconsistency existed, which she sought to explain on the basis of a 'cross-cultural misunderstanding', saying 'I think it's [the article] referring to the top of the rock, which Larrakia people ... believe ... is the head of the old man.
' 
 
424 In 1975 Bobby Secretary made a submission to Interim Commissioner Ward which stated 'Dariba Noongalinya, he is the dreaming place long long time ago may be a thousand years.
Travelling around the country, came to here and turned to rock.
If the white man put something there, something bad happen to this place Darwin ... We want this place, nobody can touch it.
...
It is our job to look after it ... Daribah Noongalinya belongs to Larrakia.
' Nipper Rankin, who also made a submission, said that 'It is a very important place for Larrakia.
Better you ask Tommy Lyons, Imabul, he's the leader for business now'.
In 1982 the Aboriginal Sacred Sites Protection Authority approved the registration of Old Man Rock as a 'sacred site', restricting access without the permission of the Aboriginal Areas Protection Authority.
425 In 1994, Topsy Secretary spoke to the Northern Territory News and said that Dariba Nungalinya would cause danger if disturbed: 'Dariba Nungalinya is a real sacred site.
It's not a joke.
People might think it's superstitious but it's not, it's real.
' It was also reported that Topsy Secretary had said that Dariba Nungalinya was responsible for Cyclone Tracy in 1974.
426 Dr Wells said that she could not recall any references in the historical record to Old Man Rock between 1931, when the articles in the Northern Territory Times and the Adelaide Advertiser were published, and the 1970's.
The Kenbi Claim 
 
427 The Kenbi Claim was a traditional land claim brought pursuant to the ALR Act.
The Aboriginal Land Commissioner, Justice Gray, described it as the 'most complex land claim in the history of the Land Rights Act'.
Section 3 of the Land Rights Act defines 'traditional land claim' to mean a claim by or on behalf of the traditional Aboriginal owners of the land arising out of their traditional ownership.
As I noted above, it concerned an extensive area of land on the Cox Peninsula.
428 The Kenbi Claim was first lodged in 1979.
It was the subject of two separate hearings, one before Justice Olney as the then Aboriginal Land Rights Commissioner in 1989-1990.
The findings in his Report were set aside by the Federal Court (see Northern Land Council v Olney (1992) 34 FCR 470).
The second hearing was before Justice Gray between 1995 and 1999.
429 There were four separate and competing claim groups.
Each sought to be recognised as the traditional owners of the land in question.
These groups included the Larrakia group, and the Danggalaba group.
There was also the Tommy Lyons group, and the Belyuen group.
Unlike the Tommy Lyons and the Danggalaba groups, the Belyuen group does not have any link with 'Larrakia' country apart from the Kenbi claim area.
It is accepted that the Larrakia group in the current proceedings is the same as in the Kenbi Claim proceedings.
Some of the people identified as Danggalaba group members in the Kenbi Claim are among the second applicants in the current proceedings.
430 Although the Kenbi Claim was brought under the ALR Act, evidence presented during its hearings, in particular about the relationship of Aboriginal people to land and waters, is also relevant to the current proceedings.
431 Section 86 of the NT Act provides as follows:
 
 'Subject to subsection 82(1), the Federal Court may: 
 (a) receive into evidence the transcript of evidence in any other proceedings before: 
 
 
 (i) the Court; or 
 (ii) another court; or 
 (iii) the NNTT; or 
 (iv) a recognised State/Territory body; or 
 (v) any other person or body; 
 
 
 and draw any conclusions of fact from that transcript that it thinks proper; and 
 (b) receive into evidence the transcript of evidence in any proceedings before the assessor and draw any conclusions of fact from that transcript that it thinks proper; and 
 (c) adopt any recommendation, finding, decision or judgment of any court, person or body of a kind mentioned in any of subparagraphs (a)(i) to (v).
' 
 

432 Proceedings before the Aboriginal Land Commissioner do not fall within the descriptions in s 86(a)(i)-(iv).
However, consistent with the approach of Olney J in The Wandarang, Alawa, Marra and Ngalakan Peoples v Northern Territory [2000] FCA 923 ; (2000) 104 FCR 380, I approach the matter on the basis that the Aboriginal Land Commissioner is 'any other person or body' within the meaning of s 86(a)(v) of the NT Act.
Both the applicants and the Territory accepted that.
In accordance with s 86, I received into evidence extensive transcripts of evidence in the Kenbi Claim.
433 On 5 June 2002 I made the following order: 
 
 '2.
If a party proposes to apply to the Court for an order pursuant to section 86 of the Native Title Act that party shall file and serve on or before 2 August 2002 a note setting out with full and detailed particulars the evidence or the recommendation, finding, decision or judgment that is the subject of the proposed application.
' 


 
434 Notices were filed and served by both the first applicants and the Territory.
The notices have been overtaken by an agreed table of Kenbi Claim transcript.
This agreed table of transcript, tendered by consent by the first applicants and the Territory, was received by the Court without objection by any party.
The transcript which has been tendered amounts to thousands of pages, and it contains evidence from many of the witnesses called in the current proceedings.
435 The first applicants sought to have this Court adopt certain findings made by Justice Gray in the Kenbi Report.
In its Amended Final Notice of Application for Orders pursuant to s 86 Native Title Act , filed 9 July 2003, the first applicants listed the findings of the Commissioner which it wished the Court to adopt, as follows:
 Paragraph of Kenbi Report Description of contents [4.9] (Except the last 5 sentences of [4.9]) Descent criterion of the Larrakia Group [4.10] (Except the 4 th sentence of [4.10.32]) Genealogies of members of the Larrakia Group [4.11] Larrakia Group a local descent group [4.12] List of members of Larrakia Group [5.4] Sites and dreamings [7] Rights to forage [9.4] The Larrakia Group: achievements and traditional attachment [10.1] (First five sentences only) Numbers of people advantaged by finding of "Aboriginal land" 

 
436 The Territory submitted that these findings ought not be adopted.
In particular, it challenged the adoption of the findings that the Larrakia people had a right to forage, had a traditional attachment to and were entitled by Aboriginal law and custom to use or occupy the Cox Peninsula.
The findings were challenged on the basis that they were comprised of findings of fact and law, and were made in accordance with the requirements of the ALR Act, and so do not directly or readily transpose into findings applicable under the NT Act.
437 There is no precise correspondence between the proof requirements under the NT Act and those for a claim under the ALR Act.
Section 3 of the ALR Act defines 'traditional Aboriginal owners' as including that they be a local descent group of Aboriginals who have common spiritual affiliations, being affiliations that place that group under a primary spiritual responsibility for the particular land.
It is a term which does not include all those Aboriginals who may have a traditional right to use or occupy the land: cf s 71(1) of the ALR Act, and the discussion by Northrop, Hill and O'Loughlin J in Northern Land Council v Olney (1992) 34 FCR 470 at 478-485.
The Territory contended that since Justice Gray's findings were made in accordance with the ALR Act, and because they included findings of law or of mixed fact and law, it is not appropriate to adopt them in this matter.
438 Despite its objections to the first applicants' submissions, the Territory in its submissions on connection referred to the findings of Justice Gray in his Summary to the Kenbi Report, paras [17]-[20] and [24].
These findings were as follows:
 
 'It is well known that Aboriginal societies traditionally impart knowledge to their members progressively.
It is clear that the Belyuen group functions in this manner.
Its members hold knowledge relating to dreamings and their relationship to sites on the land claimed.
The degrees of knowledge held depend upon initiation, age and experience.
There is a considerable amount of ceremonial activity, often involving people who do not live at Belyuen, as well as those who do.
Some senior people are identified as leaders.
Those who have been born with entitlements to knowledge are considered not to have lost those entitlements, even if they have moved away to live; such spiritual affiliations as those persons have acquired by birth as members of the group will remain.

 
 So far as most of its members are concerned, the Larrakia group does not have the characteristics of Aboriginal society that have been described.
The events which have occurred since the establishment of the first European settlement in 1869 have had drastic effects on the society which once existed among members of the Larrakia language group.
To a very great extent, knowledge of dreamings and sites has been lost to Larrakia people.
Young people are not routinely initiated into adulthood.
Ceremonial activity has ceased.
There had not been a consistent spiritual tradition, handed down from generation to generation, among those who are said to constitute that group.

 
 ... 
 
 At its heart, the case put on behalf of the Larrakia group is that the possession of any Larrakia ancestry entitles a person by birth to all of the spiritual affiliations available in respect of all the dreamings so far as they relate to all of the sites on or near the land claimed.
I am unable to accept this argument.

 
 ... 
 
 With respect to the Larrakia group, the position is much more difficult.
There can be no doubt that some members of the Larrakia group have spiritual affiliations to sites on the land claimed.
Others have affiliations to the land itself, rather than to specific sites.
In my view, the absence of a detailed common tradition of spiritual affiliations with sites, handed down from generation to generation to members of the Larrakia group, has resulted in the development of different spiritual responses on the part of different people.
In the absence of such a tradition, it is difficult to make findings as to the nature of the spiritual affiliations, if any, of the many Larrakia group claimants who did not give any evidence.
The lack of the regular practice of ceremonial activity related to dreamings and sites, and of the staged acquisition of knowledge in association with that ceremonial activity, has resulted in different members of the Larrakia group having spiritual affiliations that differ essentially in many ways.
As such, to attempt to speak of spiritual affiliations which are "common" to the members of the Larrakia group would be unreal.
' 
 

439 The issue is whether any findings of the Land Rights Commissioner in the Kenbi Report ought be adopted in this matter, in circumstances where that course of action is not consensual.
440 Section 86(c) was inserted in the NT Act by the amending Act.
There is nothing in either the Explanatory Memorandum to that Act or the Second Reading Speech that addresses the issue.
The predecessor to s 86 was clause 79 of the Native Title Bill 1993 (Cth), which provided that 'The Court can ... take into consideration any relevant recommendations and decisions made by an assessor, any other court or any other body'.
The relevant passage in the Explanatory Memorandum to that Bill reads as follows:
 
 'This means that the Court can save time or resources by choosing not to reconsider matters that have already been canvassed in earlier proceedings.
' 
 

441 In Phillips v State of Western Australia [2000] FCA 1274 , Carr J was asked to strike out certain applications for a determination of native title over an area of land in Western Australia.
A delegate of the Native Title Registrar had previously decided that the applications would not be accepted for registration.
The respondent submitted that the Court ought to adopt the delegate's decision pursuant to s 86(c).
His Honour concluded that he would not adopt the earlier findings by the delegate of the Native Title Registrar.
However, His Honour said at [16]: 
 
 'In respect of non-controversial matters, there might well be a saving of time and resources if the Court were to exercise its discretion to adopt particular findings or decisions of a court person or body of a kind mentioned in s 86.
There might also be cases where that would be an appropriate exercise of the discretion even in contentious matters.
That would depend upon the subject matter of the proposed adoption and the circumstances of each case.
' 
 

442 In the current proceedings, I am inclined not to adopt any of the findings of the Land Rights Commissioner in the Kenbi Report.
The Kenbi Claim covered a claim area distinct from that involved in these proceedings.
Not all of the witnesses who gave evidence before his Honour were called in these proceedings, for various reasons.
The expert evidence was in part from different witnesses.
The expert evidence too related to the different issues which arose under the ALR Act, and was in respect of different land.
The matters to which those findings relate have also been, to varying degrees, the subject of additional and in some instances different evidence in the current proceedings.
Those considerations have led me to the view which I have expressed.
443 I have addressed in part the evidence during the Kenbi Claim in the course of my findings above.
I will refer to it further below.
The Anthropological Evidence 
 
444 It is at this point helpful to discuss the anthropological evidence and the genealogical evidence.
It introduces and explains the traditional laws and customs which, the applicants contend, are presently recognised by them and which can be traced back through their preceding generations to the society of Larrakia people which I have found to have existed at sovereignty.
445 I propose then to make findings about the current society of Larrakia people, in particular rights and interests which they claim to possess under the laws and customs observed by them, and by which they have a connection to the land and waters of the claim area.
From that point, I will turn to my ultimate findings or conclusions on whether those rights and interestes under those laws and customs are in essence the same as those which existed at sovereignty and whether their acknowledgment and observance has continued substantially uninterrupted since sovereignty.
The Form of the Anthropological Evidence 
 
446 Mr Robert Graham gave expert anthropological evidence before the Court over four days.
The first applicants tendered two reports authored by Mr Graham, one dated March 2002, and a supplementary report dated May 2003.
447 The Territory and the DCC gave a detailed list called a 'notice of objections' to the first applicants' experts' reports.
This notice outlined 111 objections to the report dated March 2002, and 18 objections to the supplementary report.
448 The objections were subject to various provisional rulings.
Some parts of the reports were received despite the objections, other parts were not received, and others were received pursuant to s 136 of the Evidence Act , that is, limited from being evidence of the truth of what is recorded.
Other sections were received as a summary of views expressed in the body of the report or conclusions based only upon the material in the body of the report.
Finally, I deferred ruling on certain sections of the reports until the applicants had the opportunity to elicit the required information from Mr Graham in examination-in-chief.
Prior to the commencement of examination-in-chief of Mr Graham, Mr Parsons, for the first applicants indicated that a small number of the provisional rulings were disputed.
The respondents did not challenge any of the provisional rulings.
449 On that basis, I informed the parties that I would treat the provisional rulings (apart from those rulings contested by the first applicant) as final rulings.
In relation to the remaining objections, I made rulings on these objections throughout the examination-in-chief of Mr Graham.
The procedure which I followed is now conventional.
Other recent native title determination applications have dealt with objections to expert reports in a similar fashion.
See Daniel at [230]; Daniel v State of Western Australia [2000] FCA 1356 ; and Neowarra v State of Western Australia (No 1) [2003] FCA 1399 ; (2003) 134 FCR 208 ( Neowarra ) at [11].
However, in view of the extensive submissions on the objections, it is apt that I should explain in a little detail my reasons for my ruling.
450 The relevant provisions of the Evidence Act have been analysed in cases such as Daniel v State of Western Australia (2000) 178 ALR 542, Neowarra and in Harrington-Smith on behalf of the Wongatha People v State of Western Australia (No 2) (2003) FCA 893 ( Harrington-Smith ).
I respectfully adopt those analyses.
It is therefore necessary to refer only briefly to its provisions.
451 Section 82(1) of the NT Act relevantly provides that in native title proceedings the Court is bound by the rules of evidence.
It was inserted in the NT Act by the amending Act.
452 Section 56 of the Evidence Act is the starting point for any consideration of the admissibility of evidence.
Section 56(1) provides that evidence that is relevant is admissible.
Section 55(1) provides that evidence is relevant if it could rationally affect (directly or indirectly) the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact.
Generally, opinion evidence is 'not admissible to prove the existence of a fact about the existence of which the opinion was expressed': s 76(1) Evidence Act .
Section 79 of that Act relevantly provides that '[i]f a person has specialised knowledge based on the person's training, study or experience, the opinion rule does not apply to evidence of an opinion of that person that is wholly or substantially based on that knowledge.
' Section 80 provides that opinion evidence is not inadmissible only because it is about (a) a fact in issue or an ultimate issue or (b) a matter of common knowledge.
453 It is also useful to note the hearsay provisions in the Evidence Act .
Section 59(1) provides that evidence of a previous representation made by a person is not admissible to prove the existence of a fact that the person intended to assert by the representation.
Section 60 limits the application of the hearsay rule by stating that it does not apply to evidence of a previous representation that is admitted because it is relevant for a purpose other than proof of the fact intended to be asserted by the representation.
454 The Court has the general discretion to refuse to admit evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger that the evidence might be unfairly prejudicial to a party: s 135(a).
If there is a danger that particular evidence may be unfairly prejudicial to a party, the Court may limit the use to be made of that evidence: s 136.
455 In Harrington-Smith Lindgren J outlined at [20] what must be shown to establish the admissibility of evidence of expert opinion:
 
 '(a) that the opinion is relevant (including that the field of knowledge is one in which expert opinion can properly be called (see Cross on Evidence (Australian ed) at [29050]) ( Evidence Act ss 55 , 56 ); 
 (b) that the person put forward as an expert possesses specialised knowledge in that field ( Evidence Act s 79 ); 
 (d) that the specialised knowledge is based on the person's training, study or experience ( Evidence Act s 79 );and 
 (e) that the particular opinion tendered is based on the specialised knowledge ( Evidence Act s 79 ).
' 

456 In that case Lindgren J was faced with 30 expert reports, to which 1426 objections had been lodged.
His Honour stated at [18] --- [19]:
 
 '...in the case of many of the experts' reports, little or no attempt seems to have been made to address in a systematic way the requirements for the admissibility of evidence of expert opinion [under the Evidence Act ] .
Counsel protested that, in order to ensure that the requirements of admissibility are met, lawyers would have to become involved in the writing of the reports of expert witnesses.
In the same vein, counsel said, in supporting the admission of certain parts of a report, that they were written in the way in which those qualified in the particular discipline are accustomed to write.

 
 Lawyers should be involved in the writing of the reports by experts: not, of course, in relation to the substance of the reports (in particular, in arriving at the opinions to be expressed); but in relation to their form, in order to ensure that the legal tests of admissibility are addressed.
In the same vein, it is not the law that admissibility is attracted by nothing more than the writing of a report in accordance with the conventions of an expert's particular field of scholarship.
' [emphasis included in original]
 

Lindgren J listed as one of the faults of the expert reports before the Court that they did not 
 
 'distinguish between the assumed facts on which an opinion is based and the opinion itself (cf Trade Practices Commission v Arnotts Ltd (No 5) (1990) 21 FCR 324 (Beaumont J) at 327-330; upheld on appeal in Arnotts Ltd v Trade Practices Commission (1990) 24 FCR 313 at 347-353; HG v The Queen [1999] HCA 2 ; (1999) 197 CLR 414 at [39] per Gleeson CJ; Makita at [85] per Heydon JA).
' (at [21])
 

457 His Honour observed at [24] - [25] that 
 
 'the Evidence Act does not, in terms, require, as a condition of admissibility, that an expert witness state distinctly and fully the facts assumed as the basis of his or her opinion: cf ALRC Report No 26 ('Evidence') vol 1, par 750; Quick v Stoland Pty Ltd (1998) 87 FCR 371 at 373-374 per Branson J; Daniel v State of Western Australia (2000) 178 ALR 542 (RD Nicholson J) at [5]; Sydneywide Distributors Pty Ltd v Red Bull Australia Pty Ltd (2002) 55 IPR 354 per Branson J at [10].

 
 But expert opinion will not be relevant if there is an insufficient correspondence between all the facts assumed by the expert as the basis for his or her opinion, and those proved or admitted: cf Ramsay v Watson [1961] HCA 65 ; (1961) 108 CLR 642 at 648-649.
Absent that sufficient correspondence, it cannot be known whether the opinion proffered applies to the facts proved or admitted.
