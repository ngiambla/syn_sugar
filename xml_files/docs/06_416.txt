 
1 In this proceeding, the applicant, Anthony Spalla, seeks to set aside a deed of settlement entered into by the respondents.
The matter was part heard over four days from 14 March to 17 March 2006.
At the beginning of the fourth day of the hearing, counsel for the applicant confirmed that, as he had intimated late on the third day, his instructions had been withdrawn.
He also informed the Court that those of his instructing solicitor had been withdrawn.
His instructing solicitor subsequently filed an affidavit as to when these instructions had been withdrawn.
The Court adjourned the further hearing of the matter until 26 April 2006 to allow Mr Spalla an opportunity to retain new counsel.
Mr Spalla has not yet retained new representation and is currently proceeding in person.
2 By a facsimile dated 28 March 2006, Mr Spalla asked for a "declaration of a mistrial" on the grounds that: (1) he had been "unable to engage new legal representation, due in no small measure, to the contents of a letter ... from Russell Kennedy ..."; and (2) apprehended bias on my part.
3 On 7 April 2006, I heard the parties on the matters raised by Mr Spalla.
On that day, I stated that I would not disqualify myself from proceeding with the adjourned hearing, which would continue on 26 April 2006, as previously ordered.
I also stated that, at today's directions hearing, I would deliver short reasons for declining to make orders of the kind Mr Spalla sought.
These are my reasons.
