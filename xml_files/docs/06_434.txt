 Introduction 
 
 1 On 7 April 2006, Mr Gregory Rogers commenced these proceedings by which he seeks 12 orders by way of final relief in relation to a number of loan agreements, deeds of settlement, mortgages and other instruments to which he is a party in relation to various properties.
2 In addition, Mr Rogers seeks a range of interlocutory orders concerning some of those properties the most immediately relevant of which is a claim for an injunction pending the trial of the action restraining the Respondents from exercising a power of sale by auction on 22 April 2006 of property (freehold land) described as Lot 5 on Registered Plan 137240 and having a title reference of 15361206 and a premises address of 13 Moreton Street, Toogoom (near Hervey Bay in Queensland), although Mr Rogers describes the property as having an address of either 13 or 15 Moreton Street, Toogoom.
3 The hearing of the application for an interlocutory injunction to restrain the conduct of the auction was listed for hearing on 18 April 2006 having regard to the impending auction date.
Mr Rogers is a self-represented litigant.
The Respondents are represented by solicitors and counsel.
The first directions hearing in the matter will be held at 9.30am on 4 May 2006.
The present proceeding is the most recent proceeding commenced by Mr Rogers against these Respondents and it will be necessary to put this action in context.
4 The most immediate difficulty confronting Mr Rogers is the question of whether he has standing to maintain the proceeding and in particular the application for the interim orders he seeks.
His immediate difficulty derives from the fact that on 23 February 2005, Deputy Registrar Baldwin made an order for the sequestration of the estate of Mr Rogers.
It will be necessary to record the precise status of the bankruptcy proceedings in dealing with the application.
5 In formulating these Reasons, I will identify the basis for reaching the conclusion reflected in the order, however, I primarily direct these Reasons to Mr Rogers in order to explain the operation of the relevant rules as Mr Rogers is appearing on his own behalf.
6 Unfortunately, at the outset of the hearing, there was some confusion as to the state of the material filed and relied upon by Mr Rogers in support of the application.
Mr Rogers had filed an affidavit on 7 April 2006 in support of the interlocutory application but he placed no reliance on that affidavit.
Rather, Mr Rogers relied upon an affidavit filed on 11 April 2006 which exhibits documents described as "GR1" to "GR22" although exhibits "GR18", "GR20" and "GR21" have not been filed or served by Mr Rogers and therefore those exhibits form no part of the material relied upon.
Mr Rogers also relies upon a further affidavit filed on 11 April 2006 which exhibits two documents described as "GR101" and "GR102".
7 The trustee of the estate of Mr Rogers was represented at the hearing by Mr G W Rodgers who I will describe as the "trustee's representative" so as to avoid any confusion between the Applicant and Mr Rodgers.
The trustee's representative tendered with the consent of the Applicant and the Respondents a document marked "Exhibit A" for identification which is a deed dated 15 September 2004 made between Mr Rogers and four of the present Respondents concerning aspects of arrangements made in relation to a number of the properties the subject of controversy between the Applicant and the present Respondents.
The Borrowing Arrangements between the Parties 
 
8 The Applicant has for some years conducted a building business at Hervey Bay and has generated profits from buying and selling land and other property.
In order to secure finance for the acquisition of some investment properties, Mr Rogers approached, through a broker, Mr Russell Percival and Mr Paul Hare and ultimately entities controlled or associated with each of those individuals, including, Asset Loan Co Pty Ltd ("ALC"), Asset Loan Company Pty Ltd ("ALCPL") and Riverstone Nominees Pty Ltd ("Riverstone") as trustee for the Percival Family Trust.
Mr Rogers also entered into arrangements with Mrs Judith Hare as trustee for the Hare Property Trust.
9 Monies were borrowed from one or more of these entities by Mr Rogers and entities controlled by him including a company called Living Space Holdings Pty Ltd which subsequently was placed in liquidation.
A guarantee of the loan monies was given by the wife of Mr Rogers, Mrs Lynne Rogers.
In respect of one of the properties, Ms Johanna Braas was also a borrower.
10 A number of properties were acquired by Mr Rogers and parties associated with him including the property located at 13 Moreton Street, Toogoom, a property at No.
2 Rommin Lake Crescent, Fingal Head in New South Wales and a property at 86 Mal Campbell Drive, Craignish in Queensland.
Each of these properties was offered as security for the various advances.
So far as the Fingal Head property is concerned, it seems that Mrs Lynne Rogers and Ms Johanna Braas became the registered proprietors of that property.
11 By 4 August 2004, ALCPL had made demand upon Mr Rogers for repayment of loan monies amounting to $437,573.40 and the parties were in controversy about their respective rights and obligations in relation to the various properties and the financing arrangements.
On 20 July 2004, Mr Rogers issued proceedings in the Federal Court of Australia (Q136 of 2004) against ALC, ALCPL, Mr Hare, Mr Percival, Riverstone and Ms Judith Hare.
As to the latter two parties, the proceedings were taken against them in their trustee capacity.
The Various Agreements 
 
12 On 4 August 2004, Mr and Mrs Rogers, Ms Braas, ALC, ALCPL, Mr Hare, Mr Percival and Mrs Hare and Riverstone in their trustee capacities entered into a deed of settlement which provided for the circumstances in which the property at Fingal Head might be refinanced by ALCPL by paying out an existing first mortgage with the provision of an equitable mortgage in favour of ALCPL, the sale on particular terms of the Toogoom property by Mr Rogers to ALCPL (based upon an attached contract of sale) and other conditions in relation to the Mal Campbell Drive property, the Palmwood Drive property and other Hervey Bay properties.
The deed of settlement provided for a release, discharge and indemnity in respect of various matters and the discontinuance of the Federal Court proceedings.
13 Various disputes arose in relation to the deed of settlement and the implementation arrangements contemplated by the deed which resulted in further controversy between the Applicant and the Respondents.
In particular, controversy arose concerning the requirement contained in the deed of settlement of 4 August 2004 for Mr Rogers to sell the Toogoom property to ALCPL by, on or about 15 August 2004 with clear title.
It seems that the title was subject to enforcement processes in respect of two writs, one issued by Dale  Meyers Timber Trade Centre Pty Ltd and the other by Mr Scott Petersen seeking the recovery of certain debts.
ALCPL had discharged the first mortgage but could not secure clear title due to the writs of attachment.
The second matter of controversy concerned arrangements in relation to the purchase by Mr Rogers of two further lots at Toogoom located within an estate called Fraser Waters Estate (Lots 41 and 127) and the arrangements between Mr Rogers, Mr Hare and Mrs Judith Hare concerning the payment of deposits for the purchase of those lots, the ultimate settlement of the purchase for each lot and the basis upon which the title would be held and by whom.
14 On 15 September 2004, a second deed of settlement was entered into between Mr Rogers, ALC, ALCPL, Mr Hare and Mrs Judith Hare which provided for certain loans to be made to Mr Rogers, the acquisition and on-sale of Lots 41 and 127 and the distribution of the ultimate net proceeds of sale of Lots 41 and 127 after the payment of identified outgoings with ultimately the net profit, so defined, to be distributed equally between Mr Rogers and Mr Hare.
One of the outgoings to be discharged from the proceeds of sale of Lots 41 and 127 was the performance of an indemnity obligation assumed by Mr Rogers in favour of ALCPL concerning the discharge of the writs of attachment which Mr Rogers had either failed to discharge or had not been able to originally discharge.
15 Otherwise, the deed of 15 September 2004 preserved the operation of the deed of 4 August 2004.
16 Further controversy arose between the Applicant and the Respondents concerning the property at 13 Moreton Street, Toogoom, the Fingal Head property, the implementation of the first and second deeds of settlement and conduct alleged by Mr Rogers of a disreputable kind on the part of the Respondents.
Those allegations became the subject of further proceedings in the Federal Court of Australia (QUD224 of 2004) against ALC, ALCPL, Mr Hare, Mr Percival and Mrs Judith Hare and Riverstone in their trustee capacities as to the latter two.
In March 2005, proceedings were issued by ALCPL in the Supreme Court of New South Wales (Proceeding No.
1600 of 2005) against Mrs Lynne Rogers seeking recovery of possession and other orders in relation to the Fingal Head property.
17 Again, the parties elected to resolve their differences in relation to the field of matters in controversy and entered into a third deed of settlement dated 8 September 2005.
By that deed, Mrs Lynne Rogers consented to judgment in favour of ALCPL in respect of the New South Wales proceedings and Mr and Mrs Rogers agreed to deliver up vacant possession of the Fingal Head property to ALCPL subject to the terms and conditions of the document.
The deed provided for a number of implementation arrangements and additional substantive matters including the consent by Mr Rogers to the discontinuance of the second proceeding in the Federal Court and judgment in favour of the present Respondents on a cross-claim by those Respondents in that action.
Mr Rogers agreed to transfer the Toogoom property into the name of ALC and, subject to the transfer, ALC agreed to allow Mr Rogers to reside rent free in the Toogoom property for a period of six months and granted an option to Mr Rogers or his nominee to purchase the Toogoom property within a period of six months from transfer of the property, for a nominated price.
The deed further provided for additional arrangements in relation to the discharge of the writs of attachment and other terms in relation to the Toogoom property.
The deed further dealt with aspects of the Fingal Head property, particular arrangements in relation to the Mal Campbell Drive property and other matters.
18 In outlining the chronology of events in the course of the hearing, Mr Rogers says that the matters of controversy over the period leading up to the execution of the deed of settlement on 8 September 2005 were addressed by the deed and the intention was that all matters in dispute would be resolved by the deed and all rights in relation to the field of matters in issue would merge in and be dealt with by the deed.
Nevertheless, by reason of the allegations mentioned shortly, Mr Rogers says that he was induced to enter into the deed by reason of unlawful conduct on the part of the Respondents.
The Allegations made by Mr Rogers 
 
19 In relation to each of the three deeds of settlement and the promised performance of arrangements contemplated by the deeds, Mr Rogers asserts that he was actively misled about material matters which induced him to enter into the deeds.
He asserts not only conduct he characterises as misleading or deceptive conduct but asserts conscious deceit on the part of the Respondents.
He alleges unconscionable conduct and asserts a pattern of behaviour on the part of the Respondents which has caused him significant distress and anxiety.
20 The principal affidavit relied upon by Mr Rogers however is, in truth, a collection of assertions and allegations rather than a formulation of particular conduct by particular persons at a time, on a date or at a place directed to a particular issue.
The very great difficulty apart from any other matter is that Mr Rogers does not establish facts in a coherent way which give rise to an arguable question concerning an identified right which might be protected by an interlocutory order.
One of the central matters upon which Mr Rogers particularly relies is to be found, he says, at paragraph 7(k) of his more lengthy affidavit by which he contends that, "the Respondents concealed and encouraged Rogers not to repay loans as the Third Respondent (Mr Hare) would buy part of his business and this would extinguish the debts.
Hare then failed to buy shares and called up the loan at penalty interest of 12% per month".
No greater detail than that is given of this alleged arrangement by which the Respondents are said to have encouraged Mr Rogers not to repay loans or make payments in a timely way consistent with his obligations.
21 Other important matters alleged by Mr Rogers include conduct on the part of Mr Hare and Mr Percival of breaking into the home of Mr Rogers and Mrs Rogers to take files and papers in relation to the various property transactions, conduct of intimidating and harassing Mr Rogers and his family, conduct of threatening Mr Rogers and his family in various ways, committing perjury in proceedings before His Honour Justice Spender, asserting facts before the Supreme Court of New South Wales in proceedings for recovery of vacant possession of the Fingal Head property which were known to be untrue, entering into agreements without any intention of performing the terms of those agreements, aiding and assisting, for an entirely improper purpose, Dale  Meyers Timber Trade Centre Pty Ltd in taking bankruptcy proceedings against Mr Rogers and extracting profit sharing arrangements in relation to particular properties as an incident of the provision of finance by the Respondents which Mr Rogers would not otherwise have accepted but for alleged unconscionable conduct and undue influence.
22 In formulating the application for interlocutory relief and fundamentally, the affidavit material, Mr Rogers "must be able to show sufficient colour of right to the final relief in aid of which interlocutory relief is sought": Gleeson CJ, Australian Broadcasting Corporation v Lenah Game Meats Pty Ltd [2001] HCA 63 ; [2001] 208 CLR 199 at 217, paragraph [11] or, "(1) that there is a serious question to be tried or that the plaintiff has made out a prima facie case, in the sense that if the evidence remains as it is there is a probability that at the trial of the action the plaintiff will be held entitled to relief; (2) that he will suffer irreparable injury for which damages will not be an adequate compensation unless an injunction is granted; and (3) that the balance of convenience favours the granting of an injunction": Mason A-CJ, Castlemaine Tooheys Ltd v South Australia [1986] HCA 58 ; (1986) 161 CLR 148 at 153.
Sir Frederick Jordan in his work C hapters on Equity in New South Wales , 6 th Edition (1947) at page 146 simply put the jurisdiction to make an interlocutory order, in these terms, "the purpose of an interlocutory injunction is to keep matters in statu quo until the rights of the parties can be determined at the hearing of the suit" .
The Bankruptcy of Mr Rogers 
 
23 On 23 February 2005, Deputy Registrar Baldwin made an order for the sequestration of the estate of Mr Rogers based upon a failure to comply with a bankruptcy notice founded upon a default judgment in favour of a creditor.
An application for review of that order was filed on 25 February 2005 in the Federal Magistrates Court.
On 15 March 2005, Federal Magistrate Baumann made an order staying the sequestration order pending the determination of the application for review.
On 19 May 2005, Federal Magistrate Baumann dismissed the application for review and discharged the stay order of 15 March 2005.
On 25 May 2005, Mr Rogers appealed to the Federal Court from the order of Federal Magistrate Baumann dismissing the application for review.
Mr Rogers made a further application for a stay of the sequestration order pending the determination of the appeal.
His Honour Justice Dowsett on 14 June 2005 dismissed the motion for a stay, ordered Mr Rogers to pay the costs of the motion and made directions in relation to the appeal: Rogers Trading as Living Space Building v Dale  Meyers Timber Trade Centre Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 862.
On 5 December 2005, His Honour Justice Dowsett heard and determined the appeal by Mr Rogers, dismissed the appeal and ordered Mr Rogers to pay the costs of the appeal: Rogers v Dale  Meyers Timber Trading Centre Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 1891.
24 On 1 March 2005, the Respondents in Federal Court proceeding QUD224 of 2004 also being the Respondents in this proceeding, gave notice to the trustee of the estate of Mr Rogers for the purposes of section 60 of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth).
Section 60(2) provides that an action commenced by a person who subsequently becomes a bankrupt is, upon his becoming a bankrupt, stayed until the trustee makes an election, in writing, to prosecute or discontinue the action.
Section 60(3) provides that if the trustee does not make such an election within 28 days after notice of the action is served upon him by a respondent, the trustee shall be deemed to have abandoned the action.
25 The trustee made no such election for the purposes of section 60(3) of the Bankruptcy Act within 28 days of notice of the proceeding from the Respondents, or at all.
The Federal Court Proceedings (QUD224 of 2004) commenced by Mr Rogers 
 
26 Proceeding QUD224 of 2004 was a proceeding by which Mr Rogers sought to agitate many of the things that he now says in the present proceeding.
On 8 December 2004, His Honour Justice Spender declined to make certain interlocutory orders sought by the Applicant but did make an order that upon Mr Rogers' undertaking "not to dispose or further encumber the property at 15 Moreton Street, Toogoom until the determination of the proceedings, it is ordered that the Respondents do not seek to take, deal with or recover possession of the property at 15 Moreton Street, Toogoom or otherwise deal with it until the determination of the proceeding".
His Honour then made extensive directions orders for the conduct of the litigation.
On 8 April 2005, His Honour made a further order which touched upon the Applicant's allegations of harassment by the Respondents by ordering that the, "undertaking of Respondents as natural persons made 8 December 2004, not to harass or intimidate Applicant remains in full force and effect".
27 On 6 October 2005, His Honour Justice Spender heard a notice of motion filed by the Respondents seeking an order that Proceeding QUD224/2004 be dismissed.
His Honour considered the effect of the stay order by Federal Magistrate Baumann, the discharge of the stay, the dismissal of the application for review, the pending appeal before Justice Dowsett and the operation of section 60 and particularly section 60(3) of the Bankruptcy Act , in the circumstances of the case.
His Honour also had regard to the provisions of the deed of settlement dated 8 September 2005 and the content of the orders made, as put to His Honour, by the Supreme Court of New South Wales.
So as to avoid a question of whether an order for dismissal might give rise to a res judicata of underlying causes of action, His Honour, in the face of submissions from the trustee of the estate of Mr Rogers, made a declaration that, "action QUD224/2004 is deemed abandoned by operation of s60(3) of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth)", an order that "the proceeding be struck out" and "no order as to costs".
The Present Proceeding 
 
28 In the present proceeding, the Applicant seeks the following orders by way of final relief.

 "1.
An order that any Loan Agreements  Deeds of Settlement are void.

 
 
 
 2.
