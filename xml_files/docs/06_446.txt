 Cadbury's case 113 
 Conclusions 121 
 
 
 1 The applicant Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd (Cadbury) has brought this proceeding against the respondent Darrell Lea Chocolate Shops Pty Ltd (Darrell Lea) alleging contravention of ss 52 , 53 (c) and 53 (d) of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) and passing off constituted by Darrell Lea's use in its chocolate confectionery business of a shade of purple in which Cadbury claims it has a "substantial, exclusive and valuable reputation and good will".
2 This case is concerned with the nature of Cadbury's reputation in this particular shade of purple and whether Darrell Lea's conduct, in all the circumstances, has misled, or is likely to mislead, consumers into thinking Darrell Lea's products are those of Cadbury or that Darrell Lea itself or its products have some kind of association with Cadbury.
Cadbury's history in Australia 
 
3 Cadbury is a member of a worldwide group of companies of which the United Kingdom company Cadbury Schweppes plc is the ultimate parent.
The business goes back to 1824 when John Cadbury opened a shop selling cocoa and drinking chocolate in Birmingham.
The Cadbury group employs over 55,000 people and has manufacturing operations in 35 countries.
4 Cadbury has operated in Australia since the 1920s when the predecessor of its parent purchased a confectionery business from Thomas Edward Cooper and established a factory at Claremont, near Hobart in Tasmania.
This factory remains the main manufacturing centre for Cadbury in Australia.
The Cadbury business both worldwide and Australia has expanded through amalgamations.
In 1969 there was a global merger between Cadbury and the Schweppes soft drink business.
In the mid 1960s Cadbury acquired the Australian manufacturer MacRobertsons whose line of products included Cherry Ripe and Freddo Frog.
Cadbury's chocolate confectionery business 
 
5 Cadbury's confectionery business is divided into chocolate, sugar and food segments.
The largest of these is the chocolate segment which accounts for approximately 75 per cent.
Cadbury holds 55 per cent of the chocolate confectionary market as a whole and Cadbury Dairy Milk holds 73 per cent of the market for block chocolate (both figures by value).
6 Cadbury is beyond doubt the dominant figure in the chocolate confectionery market in Australia.
Its particular strength lies in moulded block chocolates and especially Cadbury Dairy Milk, which is Cadbury's flagship brand.
Cadbury's Dairy Milk is a milk chocolate product.
It is sold in plain form, with a dark purple wrapping.
Other moulded block milk chocolate products include Fruit  Nut, Hazelnut, Snack, Crunchie, Caramello, Brazil Nut, Black Forest, Three Wishes, Malt Crisp, Cashew, Breakaway, Marble, Mousse, Nut Break, Top Deck, Roast Almond, Triple Decker, Turkish Delight and Peppermint.
Cadbury's Dairy Milk is available in different size blocks, 400g, 250g, 150g, 100g, 55g and also in rolls, special treat size, share packs and "chocettes" (bite size balls).
