 
 HIS HONOUR: 
 INTRODUCTION 
 
1 The Civil Aviation Safety Authority ('CASA') applied, pursuant to s 30DE of the Civil Aviation Act 1988 (Cth) ('the Act'), for orders prohibiting the first and second respondents from doing anything that would otherwise be authorised under their respective pilot licences for a period of 25 days.
2 I earlier refused the application, and now provide reasons for that decision.
BACKGROUND AND HISTORY OF PROCEEDINGS 
 
3 The first respondent, Mr Boatman, is a director and shareholder of Boatman Nominees Pty Ltd trading as Stawell Aviation Services ('Stawell Aviation').
The second respondent Ms Kennedy is an employee of Boatman Nominees Pty Ltd. That company held an air operator's certificate authorizing it to conduct charter operations.
4 Mr Boatman held a commercial pilot licence endorsed with a condition requiring him, for medical reasons, to have a qualified co-pilot.
He also held a private pilot and a student pilot licence, neither of which had that condition endorsed on it.
Ms Kennedy also held a commercial pilot licence, private licence, student pilot licence and radio telephone licence.
The various licences are species of 'authorisations' under the Act.
5 On 29 April 2004, Mr Boatman was the pilot of a Cessna 172K aircraft, flying with a holder of a student pilot licence and two other passengers, one of whom was a fare-paying passenger who chose to fly in that plane.
Ms Kennedy was the pilot of a Cessna 172RG aircraft, carrying two fare paying passengers and one other passenger.
6 Each aircraft took off along a public road, Browne Street, in Innamincka, South Australia, a very small and isolated settlement.
The matter came to CASA's attention and CASA staff made preliminary enquiries.
7 On 13 May 2004 and pursuant to s 30DC(1) of the Act, CASA suspended the civil aviation authorisations held by the respondents.
8 As will be seen in more detail below, the legislation envisages a scheme which enables CASA to act in the perceived interests of safety, but allows quick and interim review by this Court.
A case like this would often involve a decision by CASA to suspend an authorisation in circumstances where time has not permitted a proper investigation to occur, an application by CASA to the Federal Court within five days for adjudication of that suspension, and an early hearing of that application by the Court, taking into account the possibility that CASA may need more time for a full investigation.
9 However, this matter has followed a much more protracted course.
Prior to the substantive issue being heard, the matter was twice before a Full Federal Court, first in relation to the validity of s 30DE of the Act, the validity of the section being upheld: Civil Aviation Safety Authority v Boatman [2004] FCAFC 165 (' CASA No 1 '); and secondly, in relation to confusion over consent orders that are not relevant to the present proceedings: Civil Aviation Safety Authority v Boatman [2004] FCAFC 336 ; (2004) 139 FCR 444 (' CASA No 2 ').
STATUTORY FRAMEWORK 
 
10 The statutory framework was set out and considered, from the viewpoint of constitutional validity, in the first Full Court judgment in this matter ( CASA No 1 ).
I reproduce Sundberg J's summary (at [2]-[11]): 
 
 ' Sections 30DC and 30DE are in Division 3A of the Act, which is headed "Serious and imminent risks to air safety".
Division 3A was inserted by the Civil Aviation Amendment Act 2003 (the 2003 Act).
Subdivision B, which consists of ss 30DB to 30DD, is headed "Suspension for contravening the serious and imminent risk prohibition".
Section 30DB provides: 
 
 
 
 "The holder of a civil aviation authorisation must not engage in conduct that constitutes, contributes to or results in a serious and imminent risk to air safety.
"
 
 
 
 The expression "civil aviation authorisation" is defined in s 3 of the Act as 
 
 
 
 "an authorisation under the Civil Aviation Regulations to undertake a particular activity (whether the authorisation is called an authority, licence, certificate, rating or endorsement or is known by some other name".

 
 
 Section 30DC(1) provides: 
 
 
 
 "Where CASA has reason to believe that the holder of a civil aviation authorisation has engaged in, is engaging in, or is likely to engage in, conduct that contravenes section 30DB, CASA may suspend the authorisation by giving written notice to the holder.
"
 
 
 
 The subsection is followed by a "Note" that CASA is not required to give the holder a show cause notice before making a decision under the subsection.
Subsection (3) provides: 
 
 
 
 "The suspension ends at the end of the fifth business day after the day on which the holder was notified of the suspension, unless before that time CASA makes an application to the Federal Court under section 30DE.
"
 
 
 
 A "Note" to the subsection informs the reader that if CASA makes an application in time, the suspension continues in force until it comes to an end under s 30DJ.

 
 Subdivision C, which consists of ss 30DE and 30DF, is headed "Court order in relation to the serious and imminent risk prohibition".
Section 30DE is as follows: 
 
 
 
 "(1) If CASA suspends a civil aviation authorisation under section 30DC, CASA may, before the end of the fifth business day after the day on which the holder of the authorisation was 

 notified of the suspension, apply to the Federal Court for an order under this section.
(2) If the Federal Court is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the holder has engaged in, is engaging in, or is likely to engage in, conduct that contravenes section 30DB, the Court must make an order that prohibits the holder from doing anything that is authorised by the authorisation but that, without the authorisation, would be unlawful.
(3) In deciding under subsection (2), the Federal Court must have regard to section 3A and subsection 9A(1).
(4) Subject to section 30DF, an order continues in force for the period determined by the Federal Court when making the order, being the period (not more than 40 days) that the Court considers reasonable to allow CASA to complete an investigation into the circumstances that gave rise to CASA's decision to suspend the authorisation.
"
 
 
 
 
 Section 30DF empowers the Court to extend (by not more than twenty eight days) or shorten the period determined under s 30DE(4).

 
 Sections 3A and 9A(1), referred to in s 30DE(3), are as follows: 
 
 
 
 
 "3A The main object of this Act is to establish a regulatory framework for maintaining, enhancing and promoting the safety of civil aviation, with particular emphasis on preventing aviation accidents and incidents.
...
 9A(1) In exercising its powers and performing its functions, CASA must regard the safety of air navigation as the most important consideration.
"
 
 
 
 
 CASA's functions are listed in s 9.
They include the function of conducting the safety regulation of civil air operations in Australian territory in accordance with the Act and the regulations.

 
 Subdivision D, which consists of ss 30DG to 30DJ, is headed "Investigation and further action by CASA".
Section 30DG provides: 
 
 
 
 "If the Federal Court makes an order under section 30DE in relation to a civil aviation authorisation, CASA must, by the end of the period that the order is in force, complete an investigation into the circumstances that gave rise to CASA's decision to suspend the authorisation under section 30DC.
"
 
 
 
 Section 30DH provides: 
 
 
 
 "(1) This section applies if, after CASA's investigation under section 30DG: 
 
 
 
 (a) CASA has reason to believe that a serious and imminent risk to air safety would exist if the civil aviation 

 authorisation were not varied, suspended or cancelled; and
 (b) the grounds for CASA's belief are related to the circumstances that gave rise to CASA's decision to suspend the authorisation under section 30DC.

 
 
 
 (2) CASA may, within 5 business days after the last day on which the order is in force: 
 
 
 
 (a) give the holder of the authorisation a show cause notice; and
 (b) allow the holder to show cause, within such reasonable time as CASA specifies in the notice (not more than 28 days), why the authorisation should not be varied, suspended or cancelled.
" 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Section 30DI provides: 
 
 
 
 "(1) This section applies if, after the end of the period specified in a show cause notice given under section 30DH: 
 
 
 
 (a) CASA is satisfied that a serious and imminent risk to air safety would exist if the civil aviation authorisation were not varied, suspended or cancelled; and
 (b) the grounds for CASA's belief are related to the circumstances that gave rise to CASA's decision to suspend the authorisation under section 30DC.

 
 
 
 (2) CASA may vary, suspend or cancel the authorisation, by written notice given to the holder of the authorisation within 5 business days after the end of the period specified in the show cause notice.
"
 
 
 
 
 Section 30DJ provides: 
 
 
 
 "If CASA suspends a civil aviation authorisation under section 30DC and applies to the Federal Court for an order under section 30DE, the suspension continues in force until the time worked out under the table (unless earlier revoked).
