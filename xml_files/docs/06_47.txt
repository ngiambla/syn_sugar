2 The respondent submitted that this Court has no power to set aside those orders.
I doubt that is so and I am prepared to assume that the Court does have the power.
In any event, having regard to the history of the matter and the non-appearance of Mr Khan on several occasions, including today, and for the reasons given by Mr Markus, the appropriate order is to dismiss the application with costs.
I certify that the preceding two (2) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Moore.
Associate:

Dated: 14 February 2006
