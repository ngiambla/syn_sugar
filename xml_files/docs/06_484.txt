 
 1 This is an application pursuant to s 39B Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth) and ss 23 and 32 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) by Notice of Appeal filed on 11 August 2005, for review of a decision of McInnis FM given on 25 July 2005.
The appellant is a citizen of Sri Lanka who lodged an application for a change in circumstance (residence) (class AG) sub-class 806 family (special need relative) visa on 31 July 1998.
He has claimed that he is a 'special need relative' in relation to his brother ('the nominator').
2 The appellant filed an amended application on 16 June 2004 seeking judicial review of a decision of the Migration Review Tribunal ('the Tribunal') made on 18 February 2004.
The Tribunal in that decision affirmed a decision of the delegate of the Minister refusing to grant to the appellant a family visa.
McInnis FM on 25 July 2005 affirmed the decision of the Tribunal.
3 The Tribunal was added as a respondent to the action by consent orders of Gray J on 2 September 2005.
4 The appellant has appealed to this Court from the decision of McInnis FM.
The appellant claims by way of principal relief:
 
 
 1.
A declaration that the decision is invalid and contrary to law;
 2.
Pursuant to s 39B Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth), a writ of mandamus, prohibition and certiorari or an injunction and declaration;
 3.
An order setting aside the decision;
 4.
An order that the respondents give further consideration according to law to all the matters to which the decision relates subject to such directions as the Court sees fit; and
 5.
Such other orders as the Court sees fit.

 

5 The Court is hearing this application in its appellate jurisdiction: ss 24 and 25 Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth).
BACKGROUND 
 
6 The appellant is a Sri Lankan citizen of Sinhalese ethnicity.
He entered Australia in January 1996 as the holder of a short stay (visitor) (class TT) sub-classes 435 visa.
This visa ceased on 12 February 1996.
He has held a number of visas, including bridging visas, since then.
7 On 31 July 1998 the appellant applied for a change in circumstance (residence) (class AG) sub-class 806 family (special need relative) visa, his brother being the nominator under the legislation.
As already noted, the delegate of the Minister refused to grant the visa on 10 September 2003, and the Tribunal on 18 February 2004 affirmed the decision of the delegate.
8 The relevant provisions of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth)('the Act'), including part 806 and the definition of 'special need relative' in reg 1.03, were repealed by statutory r 259 of 1999 reg 4 in Sch 2.
However, the original visa application in the case before me pre-dates the repeal, and the legislation in force as at the date of the application continues to apply.
This includes the definition of 'special need relative' as it stood before the repeal: McHugh J in Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; ex parte Cohen [2001] HCA 10 ; (2001) 177 ALR 473, cf for example Wahab v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 421.
At the time of the application, the definition of 'special need relative' in reg 1.03 Migration Regulations read:
 
 '"special need relative", in relation to an Australian citizen usually resident in Australia, an Australian permanent resident usually resident in Australia or an eligible New Zealand citizen, means a relative who is willing and able to provide substantial and continuing assistance to the citizen or resident if: 
 
 
 (a) the citizen or resident has a permanent or long-term need for assistance because of death, disability, prolonged illness or other serious circumstances affecting the citizen or resident personally, or a member of his or her family unit; and 
 
 
 (b) the assistance cannot be reasonably obtained from 
 
 
 
 (i) any other relative of the citizen or resident, being a relative who is an Australian citizen, an Australian permanent resident or an eligible New Zealand resident; or 
 
 
 
 (ii) welfare, hospital, nursing or community services in Australia.
' 

9 The nominator in this case is an Australian permanent resident, ordinarily resident in Australia.
