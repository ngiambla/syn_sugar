 Personal background 
 
1 In a statutory declaration annexed to his application to the Migration Review Tribunal for review, the appellant made the following claims:
 
 (a) The appellant met his wife, Claudine, while she was visiting Lebanon with her family at the end of December 2000.
(b) The appellant married Claudine in Lebanon on 14 July 2002.
Claudine returned to Sydney on 9 August 2002.
(c) The appellant was granted a temporary spouse visa on 13 September 2002 and arrived in Australia on 14 November 2002.
(d) The couple first stayed at the home of Claudine's parents and then moved to the appellant's sister's home in Merrylands.
(e) Claudine then ignored the appellant and "put him down" in private and in public, and did not treat him with respect.
(f) Soon afterwards, Claudine informed the appellant that she regretted marrying him and that she had no feelings for him anymore.


2 The appellant claimed that Claudine:
 
 'humiliated, insulted, abused and endangered my health and life.
She dominated the relationship and caused me stress, anxiety and despair.
She is directly responsible for damaging my life, self esteem and confidence in myself as a man and a human being.
...
The emotional and psychological damage she caused to me in a short time will take many years to heal.
' 
 

3 In addition to his statutory declaration, the appellant submitted to the Tribunal:
 
 (a) a report dated 18 February 2003 from Dr Ben Teoh, a consultant psychiatrist and physician; and 

(b) a report dated 5 March 2003 from Dr Hany Hanna, a registered medical practitioner

(together, 'the medical reports').
Procedural background 
 
4 On 25 July 2002, the appellant, made an application for a Partner (Migrant) (Class BC) visa to the Minister.
On 28 April 2003, the Minister's delegate refused to grant the visa, principally on the basis that the appellant had failed to demonstrate that the suffered domestic violence committed by the sponsoring spouse was within the meaning of Migration Regulations 1994 (Cth) reg 100.221(4)(c)(i).
5 On 19 May 2003, the Tribunal received an application for review of the decision of the delegate.
On 2 June 2004, the appellant attended a hearing and gave oral evidence in support of his claims.
On 9 June 2004, the Tribunal wrote a letter to the appellant informing him that it had made a decision and notifying him of the date on which the Tribunal would hand down its decision ('the 9 June letter').
On 23 June 2004, the Tribunal handed down its decision affirming the decision of the delegate.
6 The Tribunal found that the appellant had not suffered from domestic violence and that he had not satisfied the requirements of reg 1.24(2)(a) of the Regulations, in that he relied upon statutory declarations of two competent persons, Dr Teoh and Dr Hanna ('the statutory declarations') who were both medical practitioners.
This did not satisfy different subparagraphs of paragraph (a) of reg 1.21(1) as required by reg 1.24(2).
The statutory declarations, annexing the medical reports, had been submitted by the appellant to the delegate.
The appellant submitted the medical reports to the Tribunal for the purposes of his application but did not resubmit the statutory declarations.
7 On 1 September 2005, Lloyd-Jones FM heard the appellant's application for review of the Tribunal's decision.
The grounds of that application were:
 
 
 '1.
The Tribunal erred in law by accepting letter to the Department by Claudine Mardini stating the relationship with the visa applicant has ended and that the visa applicant was only with her to gain entry to Australia and that she bore much emotional abuse from him.
The Tribunal fell into jurisdictional error on the basis that they accepted such statement without cross examining or verifying this information.

 
 
 
 
 
 2.
The Tribunal took evidence from the applicant and his brother-in-law, Tony Mardini, (who is Claudine's Uncle) and such evidence was uncontested as truthful and the Tribunal erred in law by denying the applicant his natural right to be considered as a victim of domestic violence.
Such is a jurisdictional error.

 
 
 
 
 
 3.
The Tribunal erred in law by stating in the decision dated 23 June 2004 verse 18 'the visa applicant confirmed that his former spouse was still alive and that he had no children either from that relationship or any other'.
The applicant was never married before.

 
 4.
The Tribunal did not fully understand the violence suffered by visa applicant in spite of the medical reports and oral evidence supported by witnesses.
The applicant wishes to rely on the transcript of the hearing which is attached to prove he has suffered domestic violence for the purpose of the regulation and the poor translation may have led the Presiding Member not to understand the gravity of the suffering of the applicant.
' 
 
 
 

8 On 30 September 2005 the Federal Magistrate dismissed the application.
His Honour held that in the absence of any evidence of a judicially determined claim of domestic violence, the determination of the proceedings was confined to the single issue of whether the statutory declarations satisfied the requirements of Division 1.5 of the Regulations.
9 His Honour noted that the appellant had sought to satisfy the requirements of the statutory regime by presenting reports from two competent persons, whose qualifications and descriptions clearly placed both of them within reg 1.21(1)(a)(i), in breach of the requirements of reg 1.24(2)(a).
His Honour determined that the Tribunal had correctly applied the criteria of the Regulations.
10 On 17 October 2005, the appellant filed a notice of appeal commencing the current proceedings.
The grounds of appeal as filed in this Court were:
 
 
 '(1) The decision involves an error law as the [Tribunal] failed to accept that the applicant was a subject of domestic violence and failed to adopt that psychological, emotional and verbal abuse are domestic violence for the purpose of determining that relevant domestic violence has occurred.

 
 
 
 
 
 (2) The Tribunal committed a jurisdictional error as it failed to rely on the statutory declarations as per Singh v Minister for Immigration [2003] FMCA 186.
The Tribunal failed to accept the tendered statutory declaration as to satisfy the requirements of Division 1.5 of the Regulations.
' 
 
 
 

11 The appellant, who was represented by a migration agent before the Tribunal and unrepresented before the Federal Magistrate, is now represented by solicitor and counsel.
12 The Minister was recently served with the appellant's written submissions setting out a number of matters on which he seeks to base this appeal.
Mr Zipser, who appears for the appellant, does not rely on any error in the reasons of the Federal Magistrate.
13 This morning, a proposed amended notice of appeal was served, incorporating as grounds the matters in the submissions.
Mr Zipser now seeks leave to file the amended notice of appeal.
He suggested a possible adjournment to the Minister, who declined and is ready to proceed.
Ms Wong, who appears for the Minister, opposes the filing of the proposed amended notice of appeal, which was further amended during the hearing of the application for leave to file and rely upon it.
14 The proposed amended notice of appeal, as now pressed, contains the following grounds:
 
 (1) The Tribunal found that emotional or psychological violence was not sufficient to constitute violence within the meaning of this term in Division 1.5 of the Migration Regulations and on this basis many ' difficulties complained of [by the appellant] are not violence for the purpose of the regulations and cannot form the basis for determining that relevant domestic violence has occurred '.
The Tribunal fell into jurisdictional error on this point, which the respondent concedes.
On this basis, the appellant is entitled to relief.
(2) The Tribunal told the appellant at the hearing that relevant domestic violence was limited to physical violence and did not include emotional or psychological violence.
These statements were not correct.
The Tribunal misled the appellant.
In the circumstances there was jurisdictional error.
(3) The Tribunal's letter to the appellant dated 9 June 2004 stated in part that ' the Tribunal has made a decision on your case '.
The statement was misleading.
In the circumstances there was jurisdictional error.
(4) The Tribunal should have put to the applicant in writing that, in relation to the two statutory declarations by competent persons provided by the appellant to the Department, the competent persons were both of the same kind.
The Tribunal's failure to put these matters to the appellant in writing gave rise to a breach of s 359A of the Migration Act and jurisdictional error.


15 Grounds 5 and 6 of the proposed amended notice of appeal were not pressed.
Submissions on the grant of leave to rely on the proposed amended notice of appeal 
 
16 Mr Zipser submits that leave should be granted if the grounds are meritorious, unless there is disentitling conduct.
He points to the fact that no new evidence has been filed and that the appellant was not represented by a legal practitioner before the Federal Magistrate.
He relies on ' a recent development in the law ' in SZEEU v Minister for Immigration  Multicultural  Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCAFC 2 which, he submits, is relevant to the Tribunal's reference to the statutory declarations.
17 Ms Wong opposes leave being granted to rely on grounds not raised before Lloyd-Jones FM.
She points to the absence of any explanation for why these grounds were not raised before his Honour, other than the lack of legal representation.
Ms Wong submits, further, that an application of the principles enunciated in NAJT v Minister for Immigration  Multicultural  Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCAFC 134 ; (2005) 147 FCR 51 at [166] by Madgwick J (with whom Conti J agreed) should result in refusal of leave.
She points out that, relevantly, the law relied upon by Mr Zipser was determined in SAAP v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] HCA 24 ; (2005) 215 ALR 162 and Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Al Shamry [2001] FCA 919 ; (2001) 110 FCR 27 , both of which pre-dated the Tribunal hearing.
18 I shall return to the question of leave.
