 JUDGE: SACKVILLE J DATE: 5 MAY 2006 PLACE: SYDNEY 
 RULING ON EVIDENCE 
 
 THE EXPERT REPORT 
 
1 Objection has been taken to the tender of a report prepared by Mr Roy A Salter.
Mr Salter is a Principal of the Salter Group and is based in the Group's Los Angeles office, where he directs the firm's overall practice and project management efforts.
The Salter Group is said to be:
 
 'an independent financial and strategic advisory firm dedicated to the entertainment and media industry offering economic analysis, investment banking support, corporate development and other advisory services'.

 

2 During 2003, Mr Salter valued and advised on more than 50 media and entertainment projects, with an aggregate value of over US$3 billion.
Mr Salter's curriculum vitae shows that he has undertaken valuation and advisory work in the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Brazil.
His experience in Australia, however, appears to be limited to the valuation of a film library on a number of occasions for a particular company which has links with a company in the United States.
There is nothing to indicate that Mr Salter has particular knowledge of or substantial experience in the Australian media industry.
3 Mr Salter addresses the following question upon which he was asked to express his professional opinion:
 
 'What is the value of the opportunity lost by Seven Network to be an integrated media company in the counter-factual (over and above the value of Seven Network's individual business units on a stand alone basis)?
'
 

Mr Salter approaches this question by establishing a methodology for determining the fair market value of Seven Network, as of 1 January 2001, assuming: 
 
 '[t]he Counter-factual World in which Seven continues to operate and function as a robust integrated media company ("IMC"), and as a result, develop strategic operations and economic synergies in conducting its pay television business in ... conjunction with its other operations'.

 

4 I note that Mr Salter's report is not the only expert report upon which the applicants ('Seven') wish to rely in relation to the quantum of damages attributable to the alleged contraventions by the respondents of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) ( 'TP Act' ).
They also rely on reports prepared by Professor McFadden, an expert in economics and econometrics.
The text of Professor McFadden's reports exceeds 550 pages in length.
Professor McFadden also addresses the impact on Seven of its alleged loss of the opportunity to pursue an IMC strategy.
