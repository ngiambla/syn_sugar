 INTRODUCTION 
 
1.
These proceedings arise out of an investigation by the Australian Securities and Investment Commission ("ASIC") into a private mortgage lending business (the "mortgage business") conducted by the second respondents, a firm of solicitors ("MDRN").
In conducting the mortgage business, MDRN solicited funds from persons wishing to lend ("investors").
Investors were frequently clients of MDRN's legal practice.
MDRN also identified potential borrowers.
Lending to such borrowers would be for a specified project, with repayment secured by a first mortgage over realty.
In the usual course of events, MDRN would provide details of proposed loans to potential investors.
Each was invited to choose the borrower to whom he or she wished to lend and nominate the amount to be lent.
Normally, the loan to a particular borrower would be made up of funds coming from numerous lenders.
2.
The first respondent (the "trustee company") was a "practitioner nominee company" for the purposes of rules made by the Queensland Law Society (Inc) to regulate the conduct by solicitors of such mortgage businesses.
In effect, the trustee company's role was to receive and advance investors' funds, to take security for repayment thereof and to realize the security if necessary.
3.
The applicants deposited funds with MDRN for lending to Rivett Project Results Pty Ltd ("Project Results") for use in a development project at Yandina (the "Yandina project").
John Philip Rivett ("Mr Rivett") was a director and in effective control of Project Results.
The applicants' funds were advanced as contemplated.
The Yandina project failed.
At a later stage, I will discuss the causes of such failure.
The applicants claim to have suffered loss as a result of the respondents' conduct and sue accordingly.
The first and second cross-respondents ("St Paul" and "QBE") are insurers from whom MDRN claim indemnity and/or damages in respect of any amounts payable by them to the applicants.
