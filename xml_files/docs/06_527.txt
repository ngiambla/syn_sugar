He brought an action in the District Court of New South Wales which was settled for $285,000 including costs.
Subsequently costs of $47,500 were deducted by his solicitor and Mr Barrington received the balance.
2 Under the Social Security Act 1991 (Cth) (the Act) Mr Barrington's settlement created a "lump sum preclusion period": s 1169.
During this period Mr Barrington was not entitled to receive certain benefits under the Act including, relevantly for the present case, a Newstart Allowance.
The rationale is that a person receiving the benefit of a compensation payment for a disability should not also receive payments out of public funds for the same disability until the compensation payment is exhausted.
The lump sum preclusion period is calculated by taking 50 per cent of the compensation payment (s 17(3)) and dividing it by the "income cut-out amount" (s 17(8)).
In Mr Barrington's case the lump sum preclusion period calculated in accordance with the Act commenced on 17 September 2002 and extends to 23 April 2007.
3 However, under s 1184K(1) of the Act the Secretary of the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations may treat the whole or part of a compensation payment as not having been made if the Secretary "thinks it is appropriate to do so in the special circumstances of the case".
4 The Administrative Appeals Tribunal constituted by the Hon R J Groom, Deputy President, varied a decision of the Secretary refusing an order under s 1184K(1).
The Tribunal directed that $60,000 of Mr Barrington's compensation payment be treated as not having been made: Barrington and Secretary, Department of Employment and Workplace Relations [2005] AATA 1050.
5 On appeal to this Court the Secretary accepts that the decision of the Tribunal was open on the evidence.
