 
1 The first applicant ('Vintage') purchased certain land ('the property') from the second respondent ('Hunter Valley').
Vintage now seeks leave to join Mr Grant Johnston ('Mr Johnston'), who was at the relevant time a director of Hunter Valley, as a respondent.
The claim, broadly speaking, is that Mr Johnston is liable under s 75B of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) ('the Trade Practices Act ') and s 42 of the Fair Trading Act 1987 (NSW) ('the Fair Trading Act '), for the alleged misleading conduct of the first respondent ('GHD') and of Hunter Valley.
The claim against Mr Johnston is for loss and damage caused by the alleged misleading and deceptive conduct in contravention of s 42 of the Fair Trading Act and as a result of his being "involved" in the misleading and deceptive conduct of GHD and of Hunter Valley.
2 There are two issues arising from the notice of motion:
 
(1) Is Mr Johnston a proper party to the proceedings?
(2) Does the joinder take effect within the limitation period?
3 A further amended statement of claim ('the FASC') was filed on 2 December 2005, naming Mr Johnston as the fourth respondent.
It also named Mr Donald Johnston as third respondent but Vintage does not pursue joinder of Mr Donald Johnston.
Vintage submits that O 6 r 2 and O 6 r 4 of the Federal Court Rules (Cth) ('the Rules') apply so that Mr Johnston may be joined as a respondent after the proceedings have been commenced if it establishes that, had the joinder been made upon the commencement of the proceedings:
 
 (a) it would have been a proper joinder (that is, that O 6 r 2(a) is satisfied or that the Court is otherwise prepared to grant leave under O 6 r 2(b)); and
 (b) Vintage could have prevented summary disposal of the claim in favour of Mr Johnston.


4 Hunter Valley retained the services of GHD to ascertain, among other matters, whether there were any Aboriginal artefacts on the property, then held by Hunter Valley.
GHD carried on a business that included the provision of management, engineering, environmental, planning and architectural services.
Vintage also alleges that GHD acted as an adviser to Hunter Valley in relation to the sale of the property and in relation to applications lodged with Cessnock City Council ('the Council') for development consent for part of the property.
The FASC alleges misleading representations by GHD and, in reliance on those representations, by Hunter Valley.
