 
1 The appellants who are husband and wife are citizens of India.
They claim to fear persecution for reason of political opinion and/or by reason of membership of a particular social group.
2 The appellants arrived in Australia on 30 December 1996.
They originally applied for protection visas on 29 January 1997 but the documents contained no claims.
The application was rejected and the appellants sought review by the Refugee Review Tribunal.
The Tribunal affirmed the decision of the delegate on 15 April 1998.
3 On 15 July 2003 the appellants lodged a further application for a protection visa claiming that their original application was invalid and therefore that no prior application for a protection visa had been made.
On 20 August 2003 a delegate of the Minister refused to grant the appellants a protection visa on the further application and on 24 September 2003 the appellants made an application to the Tribunal for review of that decision.
The appellants attended the Tribunal hearing held on 19 January 2004.
The Tribunal handed down its decision on 23 February 2004.
The Tribunal found that the claims of the appellant wife depended entirely on the claims made by the appellant husband.
That has not been challenged.
I will refer to the husband as 'the appellant'.
