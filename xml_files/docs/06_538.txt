The rejection of his claim by the respondent Repatriation Commission and the Veterans' Review Board was affirmed by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal: Patterson and Repatriation Commission [2005] AATA 758.
Mr Patterson now appeals to this Court.
2 The relevant Statement of Principles (SoP) concerning hypertension for the purposes of s 120A(3) of the Act, No 35 of 2003, provides by cl 4 that at least one of the factors in cl 5 "must be related to any relevant service rendered".
The factors in cl 5 include:
 
 "(a) being obese at the time of the clinical onset of hypertension; or 
 
 (b) consuming an average of at least 200 g per week of alcohol which cannot be decreased to less than an average of 200 g per week at the time of the clinical onset of hypertension; or 
 
 (c) ingesting at least 12 g of salt supplements per day on average for a continuous period of at least six months immediately before the clinical onset of hypertension.
" 


 
3 Mr Patterson served as a gunner in the Australian Army in Vietnam from 4 February until 30 October 1971.
His clinical onset of hypertension occurred in 1978.
4 Mr Patterson contended that the material before the Tribunal raised three hypotheses for the purposes of s 120(3) of the Act.
