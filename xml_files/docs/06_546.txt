 
1 The respondent brings a notice of motion seeking an order pursuant to O 20 r 2 of the Federal Court Rules ('FCR') that the application be dismissed or stayed.
Reliance is placed on all aspects of the rule so that what is in issue is whether the application discloses no reasonable cause of action; is frivolous or vexatious; or is an abuse of the process of the Court.
In the event that any of those requirements are satisfied, the Court has a discretion to stay or dismiss the application generally or in relation to any claim for relief in the proceeding.
2 In the alternative the respondent seeks an order pursuant to FCR O 15 r 8 that the applicant file and serve an affidavit of discovery in respect of certain identified documents, being documents relating to the facts pertaining to the circumstances concerning payments made by the applicant as an employer to an employee benefit trust as described in the respondent's statement of facts, issues and contentions ('the statement').
3 The respondent supports the motion by reference to an affidavit of M/s Kowalewska, sworn on 14 March 2006.
The applicant relies upon both the affidavit of M/s Kowalewska and an affidavit of Mr Romano, sworn on 21 April 2006.
NATURE OF THE APPLICATION 
 
4 The applicant appeals against an appealable objection decision of the respondent, seeking that it be set aside or varied by allowing the applicant's objection to the extent of excising from the applicant's taxable income for the year ended 30 June 1998 the amount of $200 000 on the ground it was wrongly included in the applicant's assessable income.
The objection decision in issue is that made on 11 February 2005 in respect of the applicant's notice of assessment for the year ended 30 June 1998 issued on 10 April 2003.
5 The application by way of appeal is brought pursuant to s 14ZZ of the Taxation Administration Act 1953 (Cth).
Section 14ZZO of that Act provides that, in the case of the taxation decision concerned being an assessment (other than a franking assessment), the applicant has the burden of proving that 'the assessment is excessive'.
6 In his decision the respondent stated as follows:
 
 ' We consider these to be the relevant facts: 
 
 
 
 1.
Rangdon Pty Ltd, (the Employer), claimed a deduction for the contributions to an Employee Benefit Trust (EBT) of $200,000 and costs of $4225 in its income tax return for the year ended 30 June 1998.

 
 
 
 
 
 2.
Units in the EBT were allotted to the directors/shareholders of the Employer (or their associates) as follows: 
 
 
 
 Andrew Cartmel (100 units @ a premium of $999 per unit) $99,900 
 Lloyd D'Castro (100 units @ a premium of $999 per unit) $99,900 
 
 
 
 3.
The EBT loaned an amount of $199,000 to the Employer.

 
 
 
 What we have decided: 
 
 We have made the following decision on your objection:
 
 Disallowed in Full.
' 
 

The reasons given for the making of the decision were, firstly, that the contribution made by the applicant to the employee benefit trust and the costs were not considered to be deductible under subs 51(1) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (Cth) ('the ITAA 36').
It was conceded by the respondent on the hearing of the motion that this should have been a reference to s 8-1 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 (Cth) ('the ITAA 97') given that the payments in issue occurred during the 1998 income year.
Secondly, it was said that the Tax Office considered that Pt IVA of the ITAA 36 applied to the arrangement.
7 The grounds upon which the applicant relied in its notice of objection were that the sum of $200 000 was 'not an allowable deduction under section 8-1 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 ' to it as confirmed by Kiefel J in Essenbourne Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (2002) 51 ATR 629.
Therefore the provisions of Pt IVA of the ITAA 36 have no application to disallow that sum or any part of it, as a deduction against the applicant's assessable income.
Further it was contended that the respondent was not authorised to issue the notice of assessment under s 170 of the ITAA 36, it having been served more than four years after the date on which the original assessment became due and payable.
The original assessment was deemed to have been issued on 21 January 1999 pursuant to s 166A of the ITAA 36.
8 On 30 May 2005, the respondent filed the statement.
In it he stated that he relied on s 14ZZO of the Taxation Administration Act and, save for any facts expressly agreed or admitted in writing, put the applicant to proof of all the facts on which it seeks to rely to establish that the assessment the subject of the appeal is excessive.
Further he stated that none of the facts contained in the statement constituted an admission of proof by him.
9 In the statement at [4]---[15], the respondent set out facts which it considered to be material concerning the subscriptions to employer units and related costs and expenses.
In [18]---[29] the statement recited the facts of the notice of objection and the objection decision.
