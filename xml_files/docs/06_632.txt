 INTRODUCTION 
 
1 This proceeding arises from the collapse in 2001 of a building contractor based in Albury, A B  M A Chick (Vic) Pty Ltd (Chick Vic).
2 Chick Vic was incorporated on 7 April 1987.
From 1 February 1992, its directors were Alan Chick and the first defendant, David Jenkins.
3 On 30 April 1999, Mr Chick, Mr Jenkins, their wives and certain related companies entered into a "Business Dissolution Deed" (the Deed).
By the Deed, the Chicks and their related companies ended their involvement in Chick Vic.
From that date, Chick Vic's directors were Mr Jenkins and the second defendant, his wife Vivienne Jenkins.
4 Mrs Jenkins formally resigned as a director on 22 September 2000.
5 The nine plaintiffs are eight building sub-contractors based in Albury and Wodonga.
(The second and third plaintiffs, Mr and Mrs Fletcher, were members of a partnership at the relevant time.
) In the period from 30 April 1999, Chick Vic had engaged each of them in relation to a variety of building projects.
Those projects were not confined to the
Albury-Wodonga region.
6 By a resolution of Mr Jenkins, Christopher Chamberlain, a partner in the firm of Nicholls  Co based at Wagga Wagga, was appointed as Chick Vic's administrator on 11 January 2001.
By a resolution of creditors, Mr Chamberlain was appointed as Chick Vic's liquidator on 7 February 2001.
Chick Vic's winding up is yet to be completed.
7 The plaintiffs claim that the defendants contravened ss 588G(2) or (3) of the Corporations Law (the Law) or, alternatively, the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) (the Act).
Sub-section (1) provides that:
 
 "This section applies if: 
 
 
 (a) a person is a director of a company at the time when the company incurs a debt; 
 (b) the company is insolvent at that time, or becomes insolvent by incurring that debt, or by incurring at that time debts including that debt; and 
 (c) at that time, there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that the company is insolvent, or would so become insolvent, as the case may be ...." 
 
 
 

Sub-section (2) provides that:
 
 "By failing to prevent the company from incurring the debt, the person contravenes this section if: 
 
 
 (a) the person is aware at that time that there are such grounds for so suspecting; or 
 (b) a reasonable person in a like position in a company in the company's position would be so aware.

 
 
 

Sub-section (2) is a "civil penalty provision".
Sub-section (3) provides that:
 
 "A person commits an offence if: 
 (a) a company incurs a debt at a particular time; and 
 (aa) at that time, a person is a director of the company; and 
 
 
 (b) the company is insolvent at that time, or becomes insolvent by incurring that debt, or by incurring at that time debts including that debt; and 
 (c) the person suspected at the time when the company incurred the debt that the company was insolvent or would become insolvent as a result of incurring that debt or other debts (as in paragraph (1)(b)); and 
 (d) the person's failure to prevent the company incurring the debt was dishonest.
" 
 
 
 

8 Section 95A provides that:
 
 
 "(1) A person is solvent if, and only if, the person is able to pay all the person's debts, as and when they become due and payable.

 (2) A person who is not solvent is insolvent.
" 
 
 

9 The remedy sought by the plaintiffs is found in s 588M.
That section relevantly provides that:
 
 
 "(1) This section applies where: 
 (a) a person (in this section called the director) has contravened subsection 588G(2) or (3) in relation to the incurring of a debt by a company; and 
 (b) the person (in this section called the creditor) to whom the debt is owed has suffered loss or damage in relation to the debt because of the company's insolvency; and 
 (c) the debt was wholly or partly unsecured when the loss or damage was suffered; and 
 (d) the company is being wound up; 
 whether or not: 
 (e) the director has been convicted of an offence in relation to the contravention; or 
 (f) a civil penalty order has been made against the director in relation to the contravention.

 ... 
 (3) The creditor may, as provided in Subdivision B but not otherwise, recover from the director, as a debt due to the creditor, an amount equal to the amount of the loss or damage.

 ..." 
 
 

10 The plaintiffs' case is that:
 
 (a) the defendants were directors --- within the meaning of the Law or the Act --- of Chick Vic when it incurred a substantial number of unsecured debts to them (totalling $2,116,464.20) that remain unpaid;
 (b) Chick Vic was insolvent at the time it incurred those debts or became insolvent as a result of incurring those debts;
 (c) at the time those debts were incurred, there were reasonable grounds for suspecting that Chick Vic was insolvent or, as a result of incurring those debts, would become insolvent;
 (d) at the time those debts were incurred, the defendants were, or a reasonable person in a like position in a company in Chick Vic's position would have been, aware that there were the grounds referred to in par (c); and
 (e) as a result, the defendants ought to compensate them for Chick Vic's failure to pay the debts referred to in par (a).


That case is pleaded in a statement of claim that was first filed on 6 September 2001.
It was amended from time to time.
Notwithstanding its age, it was heavily amended only a week before the trial commenced: see Tru Floor Service Pty Ltd v Jenkins [2006] FCA 119.
I will call the current amended pleading "the statement of claim".
THE DEFENDANTS' ENTITLEMENT TO MAKE A NO CASE SUBMISSION 
 
11 At the conclusion of the plaintiffs' case counsel for the defendants submitted that there was no case for them to answer.
Argument then ensued as to whether the defendants were disabled from making a no case submission by reason of having tendered exhibits during cross-examination of the plaintiffs' witnesses.
12 The defendants relied on O 32 r 4(4) of the Rules of Court for the proposition that a party who has tendered documents in evidence may not make a no case submission.
Subrule (1) empowers the Court to give directions as to the "order of evidence and addresses and generally as to the conduct of the trial".
Subrule (2) deals with "the order of evidence and addresses ... as provided by the following sub-rules of this rule", namely sub-rs (3) to (6).
Subrule (3) provides that the party to begin may make an address opening his case and may then adduce evidence.
Subrule (4) provides:
 
 "Where, at the conclusion of the evidence for the party to begin, no document or thing has been admitted in evidence on tender by the opposite party, the opposite party may elect to adduce evidence or not to adduce evidence.
" 
 

If the opposite party does not adduce evidence, the party to begin may make a closing address and the opposite party then makes its address: sub-r (5).
If the opposite party adduces evidence, that party may make an opening address before adducing evidence, and after the conclusion of that evidence may make a closing address, whereupon the party to begin may make a closing address: sub-r (6).
13 Subrule (4) does not expressly provide for the case where, at the conclusion of the plaintiff's evidence, the defendant has tendered a document or thing in evidence.
Subrules (5) and (6) deal only with cases that fall within sub-r (4).
In that situation the gap is to be filled pursuant to sub-r (1): the Court gives directions as to the order of evidence and addresses.
Likely directions will be to the effect of those contained in r 49.01(6)(b) of the Rules of the Supreme Court of Victoria.
Rule 49.01(1) corresponds with this Court's O 32 r 4(1).
Rule 49.01(3) is to substantially the same effect as O 32 r 4(2).
Rule 49.01(4) corresponds with O 32 r 4(3).
Rule 49.01(5) is to substantially the same effect as O 32 rs 4(4) to (6).
What is not expressly dealt with in O 32 r 4(4) is covered by r 49.01(6):
 
 "When, in the course of the case for the party who begins, any document or thing is admitted in evidence on tender by the opposite party, and at the conclusion of that case --- 
 
 
 (a) the opposite party adduces evidence, the order of proceedings shall be as provided by paragraph (5)(a); 
 (b) the opposite party does not adduce evidence, he may make an address and then the party who began may make a closing address.
" 
 
 
 

The "order of proceedings" referred to in r 49.01(6)(a) is that the opposite party makes an opening address, and after adducing evidence makes a closing address, and then the party who began makes a closing address.
Subrule (6)(b) states the effect of Weller v O'Brien [1962] 1 WLR 885, which held that a defendant who elects to call no evidence loses the right of last address if he has put a document in evidence in the course of cross-examining on the plaintiff's case.
14 Weller was displaced in England and Wales by O 35 r 7(3) of the Rules of the Supreme Court (RSC), introduced in 1967.
It read:
 
 "If the defendant elects not to adduce evidence, then, whether or not the defendant has in the course of cross-examination of a witness for the plaintiff or otherwise put in a document, the plaintiff may, after the evidence on his behalf has been given, make a second speech closing his case and the defendant shall then state his case.
" 
 

In lieu of giving a direction under O 32 r 4(1) along the lines of the Supreme Court of Victoria's r 49.01(6)(b), this Court could give a direction along the lines of RSC O 35 r 7(3).
Which course it chooses to follow would depend on how it viewed Weller .
15 I do not think O 32 r 4(4) has any bearing on a no case submission.
As indicated, subrules (2) to (4) are concerned with the order of evidence and addresses.
Subrule (4) does not itself deal with a defendant who has tendered a document or thing in the course of
cross-examining the plaintiff's witnesses, and who does not adduce further evidence.
However, that gap is to be filled by directions as to the order of evidence and addresses: for example, that the defendant does not have the right of last address enjoyed by a defendant who has not so tendered a document or thing and who does not adduce evidence, or alternatively, that he does have that right.
16 That O 32 r 4(4) does not operate in the manner suggested by the plaintiffs is supported by what the Full Court said in Rasomen Pty Ltd v Shell Company of Australia Ltd (1997) 144 ALR 497 at 503:
 
 "Apart from O 32, r 4(4) of the Federal Court Rules which gives a general discretion to the court to regulate the conduct of the trial, there is no statutory provision or Rule of Court which provides for the procedure to be adopted in the Federal Court in a civil case where a ruling of no case to answer is sought.
" 
 

Further, what is said in Rasomen at 505 cannot stand with what the plaintiffs seek to derive from sub-r (4).
Similarly, in a passage concerned solely with no case submissions in this Court, the sixth Australian edition of Cross on Evidence renders (at 297) the presently relevant effect of Rasomen and Protean (Holdings) Ltd (rec and mgr apptd) v American Home Assurance Co [1985] VR 187 at 237 (Full Court), namely that there is no general rule that requires a party making a no case submission to elect to call no further evidence if some evidence has already been led, or if exhibits have been tendered during cross-examination, without any reference to sub-r (4).
THE COURSE ADOPTED 
 
17 The defendants' counsel then developed his no case submission, without then being required to elect.
The plaintiffs' counsel responded.
I then reserved my decision on the no case submission and on whether the defendants should be required to elect not to call further evidence.
This course was followed in reliance on Protean at 237-240, Rasomen at 498-499 and Compaq Computer Australia Pty Ltd v Merry (1998) 157 ALR 1 at 6-9.
In those cases approval was given to the approach to a no case submission described by Tadgell J in Protean at 237:
 
 "[The Judge] might allow the submission to be made without putting the moving party to any election at that stage but leaving, until he had heard it, the question whether or not he would rule on it without requiring an election to be made; and having heard the submission, and any answer to it by the respondent party, he could either rule on it or not, perhaps requiring an election to be made as a prerequisite to his doing so...." 
 

(His Honour had earlier indicated that the expression "moving party" meant the defendant making the no case submission and "respondent party" meant the plaintiff responding to the submission.
) Young CJ expressed a similar view at 215 and Fullagar J agreed with what Tadgell J had said.
18 In Protean the trial judge had not adopted the course I have described at [17].
Rather he had indicated that he would both entertain the no case submission and rule on it without requiring an election to be made by the moving party.
While Tadgell J did not think this an incorrect approach, his Honour clearly considered preferable that described at [17].
At
238-239 he said:
 
 "In deciding whether or not the general rule [requiring an election] should be followed the Judge will sometimes be assisted to know the basis on which the moving party seeks to rest his submission of no case.
To that end the Judge might find it useful to allow the submission to be made and answered without first requiring an election to be made, before deciding whether he will rule on it, ie to take the second course summarized above ....
When that course is followed the Judge will know, before he commits himself to rule, whether the no case submission is (a) that there is no evidence at all in support of the respondent party's case, ie accepting all the evidence at face value, no case has been established in law ..., or (b) that, although there is some evidence in support of the respondent party's case, the Judge should not act on it because, for example, it is so unsatisfactory or inherently unreliable or equivocal that he should find that the burden of proof resting on the respondent party has not been discharged ..., or (c) a combination of (a) and (b).
" 
 

See also per Young CJ at 215.
MUST THE DEFENDANTS ELECT NOT TO CALL FURTHER EVIDENCE?

 
19 The general rule is that a decision will not be given on a submission of no case unless the moving party elects to call no evidence.
However, the judge has a discretion to depart from the general rule where the particular circumstances require it.
It has been said that in deciding which course to follow, the judge will be guided by the nature of the case, the stage it has reached, the particular issues involved and the evidence that has been given.
The imposition of the requirement that the moving party make an election before the judge entertains the submission or rules on it will depend on the just and convenient disposition of the litigation.
See Protean at 238 and Rasomen at 504.
20 In William H Muller  Co's Algemeene etc v Ebbw Vale Steel, Iron  Coal Co Ltd [1936] 2 All ER 1363 at 1365-1366 Branson J said:
 
 "It seems to me that it must be a matter for the judge who is to try the case to decide for himself whether, in the particular case before him, and having regard to all the circumstances of it, it is likely to save the litigants before him expense and time and trouble to deal with the case by way of ruling upon the submission without putting any terms upon counsel upon either side, or whether it is better to say: 'In this case I think it would be desirable that before I rule I should hear the whole of the evidence.
" 
 

This passage has been referred to or quoted with approval in many cases.
See, for example, Protean at 238, Rasomen at 504, J-Corp Pty Ltd v Australian Builders Labourers Federated Union of Workers (Western Australian Branch) (No 2) (1992) 38 FCR 458 at 461-462 and Union Bank of Australia Ltd v Puddy [1949] VLR 242.
In Puddy at 245-246, after reviewing the earlier decisions on the circumstances in which, in the exercise of the discretion, it is appropriate to depart from the general rule requiring an election, Fullagar J said:
 
 "I would add only two observations of my own.
In the first place ... something may turn on the nature of the case itself.
... [W]here, as in the case before me, fraud is alleged, it may often be wrong to suggest that a party should submit himself to cross-examination before it is seen that there is really some evidence against him.
In the second place, it would seem that the exercise of the discretion must generally involve an estimating of probabilities.
If I accede to the application made to me, I may save the parties a great deal of time and expense, or I may cause them much greater expense and delay in the event of a new trial being ordered.
In order to assess these probabilities, it seems to me that it must generally be necessary to form some preliminary estimate of the evidence before ruling as to whether the submission is to be entertained without election.

 
 In the present case I felt no doubt that I ought to entertain and rule on the submission without requiring the plaintiff to elect to call no evidence.
I felt clearly of opinion that the balance of convenience was heavily in favour of this course.
The case for the defendant, consisting of the opening and examination in chief, with very little cross-examination, had lasted over three and a half days.
Then, coming to determine the application on its merits, I have felt satisfied that there was no case for the plaintiff to answer on defence or counterclaim.
" 
 

Other cases which show that the discretion to depart from the general rule requiring an election is more readily exercised where fraud is alleged are Protean at 215 and 236 and Merry at 7.
21 In Sampson v Edwards [1949] VLR 6 Lowe J said:
 
 "The plaintiffs' case has been closed with the exception of his evidence as to damages which, by consent, is standing over until the issue of liability is determined.

 ... 
 The substance of the matter argued before me is whether I should allow [counsel] to make that [no case] submission without putting him to his election as to whether he will call evidence or not on the issue of liability.

 
 In my opinion, I have a discretion as to whether or not to adopt that course, and I think that two of the factors, at any rate, which should operate with the Court in exercising that discretion are the saving of expense by hearing the application and the saving of time.
They may not be, and probably are not, the only considerations, but those are two and I think both are present in this case.
This action has now been going for the best part of four days and I have heard the evidence only of the plaintiffs and their witnesses and that only on the issue of liability.
The particulars with regard to damages which were given this morning are such as to indicate that the plaintiffs' case before it is concluded will take some further considerable time, and on both those aspects of liability and of damage the defendants would have the opportunity to call evidence, and there has been an indication in cross-examination that if the case goes to its full conclusion evidence will be called by the defendants on both those aspects.

 
 Now with those matters in my mind it seems to me that convenience does point to my adopting the course which was adopted in Hannah v Stott [1928] VLR 168, and which I think has been adopted since then in many other cases.
Those cases, and this case it is to be noted, are cases in which the Judge is sitting without a jury, and while jury cases stand on a somewhat different footing, even in those cases the Court has recognised ... that where there may be an unnecessary loss of time and money, it may be proper for a Judge to hear, at the close of the plaintiff's case, an application for judgment for the defendant.

 ... 
 I only propose to add that I think the question of putting a defendant to his election is one which arises for the protection of the Court and is not, I think, a right which is given by law to the opposing party.
" 
 

The propriety of this last observation is confirmed by Protean at 238 where Tadgell J said:
 
 "The imposition of such a requirement [ie to elect] is not a right of the respondent party, for the fate of the submission of the moving party, once made, is in no sense dependent on election or no election.
" 
 

See also Rasomen at 505.
22 Sampson and Puddy were referred to with approval by Mason and Jacobs JJ (with whom Barwick CJ agreed) in Stevenson v Barham [1977] HCA 4 ; (1977) 136 CLR 190 at 203.
Stephen J dissented in the result, but agreed with what Mason and Jacobs JJ said about election.
23 In exercising his discretion not to require the defendant to elect, the trial judge in Protean at 192-193 relied heavily on the time the case had already lasted, and the time that might be saved by hearing the no case submission.
In the Full Court Fullagar J (junior) said at 236 that no criticism could be levelled at the trial judge's exercise of discretion
 
 "in the light of the allegations of gross fraud, in the light of the reasons for judgment of Fullagar J [(senior)] in ... Puddy, and in the light of established authorities relating to appeals from the exercise of a discretion".

 

24 In support of their contention that the defendants should be required to elect not to call further evidence, the plaintiffs relied on Residues Treatment  Trading Co Ltd v Southern Resources Ltd (1989) 52 SASR 54 where, at 68-69, Perry J said:
 
 "it seems to me that there are primarily four situations in which a submission of no case to answer may be made.
They are: 
 
 
 1.
Where no reference at all to the evidence is required.

 2.
Where a reference to the evidence is required only to establish that there is an evidentiary hiatus or failure to adduce any evidence as to an essential element in the cause of action.

 3.
Where it is argued that on a consideration of the evidence adduced by the plaintiff taken at its highest from the plaintiff's point of view, the evidence could not support the causes of action pleaded.

 4.
The situation where it is contended that although there is some evidence to support the plaintiff's claim, it is so weak and unreliable that it should be dismissed without calling upon the defendant.

 
 
 ... 
 As to category 1, this should normally be argued on the pleadings, preferably before the trial commences.
No question of election arises in that situation.
Likewise, consideration of a submission of no case to answer in category 2 should not involve an election.

 
 As to categories 3 and 4, these situations should normally be met by the application of what I have referred to as the general rule that counsel should be called upon to elect.
" 
 

The plaintiffs took the defendants to be making a case falling within category 3 or 4.
25 In relation to categories 3 and 4, Perry J states the position that should "normally" obtain.
That accommodates taking a different course in the exercise of the discretion in a particular case.
Guidelines such as those his Honour offered provide a useful starting point in the general run of cases.
But there is one guideline more powerful than any others, namely that the discretion is to be exercised in the light of the facts and circumstances of the particular case.
26 The circumstances in Residues Treatment  Trading pointed strongly towards the application of the general rule.
The trial had proceeded for 47 days spread over two and a half months before the no case submission was made.
The transcript occupied more than 3,500 pages.
The argument on the preliminary question whether the defendants should be put to their election occupied three and a half days.
The no case submission related to only some of the causes of action pleaded against the defendants.
Whatever the outcome of the submission, the action would proceed in relation to the principal relief sought against them.
27 The matters referred to at [26] are not present in the instant case.
What takes this case outside the "normal" course are the likelihood that significant time and money will be saved by entertaining the no case submission, the fact that part of what is alleged against the defendants is an offence involving dishonesty (see [7]), and my prima facie impression that the plaintiffs' case on insolvency is not strong.
The weight of the first of these considerations is acknowledged by Perry J at 70.
The second was not a feature of Residues Treatment  Trading .
The third is a matter it is proper to take into account.
28 The considerations that led Finkelstein J in Merry not to require the respondents to elect can usefully be noted.
The first was the nature of the allegations made against them.
It was alleged that they were involved in a scam to defraud Compaq.
The cause of action that they procured a breach of trust required proof of dishonesty.
His Honour said that the respondents should not be required to call evidence or submit themselves to
cross-examination if a sufficient case of wrongdoing had not been established against them.
The second factor related to the efficient disposition of the case.
The respondents' evidence would have taken well over a week.
The considerable expense thus involved suggested that the respondents should not be required to go into evidence before the merits of the applicant's case had been ruled upon.
The final factor was the Judge's impression that the applicant's case had weaknesses.
His Honour's conclusion was that both the interests of justice and the efficient disposition of the case indicated that the respondents should not be put to their election.
29 All three factors relied upon in Merry exist in the present case: an offence of dishonesty, the saving of court time and expense, and the perceived weakness of the plaintiffs' case on insolvency.
30 I do not understand the plaintiffs to have submitted that the tendering of exhibits required the defendant to elect not to call further evidence.
Rather, the contention was that tendering the exhibits disabled them from making a no case submission.
I have dealt with that at [11] to [16].
In any event, had such a submission been made, I would have rejected it.
There is no general rule that requires a party making a no case submission to elect to adduce no further evidence if some evidence has already been led, or if exhibits have been tendered during cross-examination.
In a particular case, the fact that the party has taken steps of this kind will be one of the circumstances to be taken into account in the exercise of the discretion whether to require an election.
See Protean at 237 and Rasomen at 505.
31 Again, O 32 r 4(4) does not have the effect that a party is obliged to elect to adduce no further evidence by reason of having tendered exhibits during cross-examination of the plaintiff's witnesses.
What I have said at [30] is applicable in this context.
32 Contravention of s 588G(3) is an offence, one element of which is that the director's failure to prevent the company incurring the debt was dishonest.
I have referred to the cases drawing attention to the position where fraud is alleged.
The "gross fraud" referred to by Fullagar J (junior) in Protean was in fact arson --- it was alleged that the insured had lit or connived at lighting the fire.
In my view the words of Fullagar J (senior) in Puddy are apposite here --- it would be wrong for the defendants to be subjected to cross-examination on the dishonesty component of the offence before it is seen that there is some evidence of the insolvency component.
33 In the present case the plaintiffs' case took two weeks.
The parties have thus already been put to great expense, both in terms of time and money.
It is clear from what has thus far transpired that the defendants' case would have lasted at least the remaining week allocated to the proceeding.
Mr Jenkins' affidavit evidence alone (including exhibits) occupies 982 pages of the Court Book.
His evidence touches all aspects of the case: solvency, his awareness of the company's ability to pay its debts, and the quantum of the debts.
I would be surprised if he were cross-examined for less than three days.
Having regard to the
cross-examination of the plaintiffs' experts, I would expect the defendants' expert, Mr Stout, to be cross-examined for at least a day.
In those circumstances, as was the case in Sampson and Puddy , there may be a considerable saving in time and expense to the parties if the application is heard.
34 Finally, having heard argument on the no case submission, I entertained serious doubts as to the viability of the plaintiffs' case on insolvency.
35 Accordingly, for those three reasons, I do not require the defendants to elect whether to call further evidence as a condition of ruling on the no case submission.
THE TASK FOR THE JUDGE IN DETERMINING A NO CASE SUBMISSION 
 
36 In Protean the owner of premises which were damaged by fire sued its insurer for indemnity.
The insurer raised defences that the insured had lit or connived at lighting the fire and had falsely represented, and failed to disclose, to the insurer material facts.
The trial judge allowed the insured to split its case.
The insured adduced evidence on matters on which it had the onus of proof, but elected to call no evidence in relation to the defences until all the evidence for the insurer on the defences had been called.
The insurer then went into evidence on its defences.
At the close of the insurer's case the judge allowed the insured to submit that it had no case to answer in respect of the defences without being put to its election whether or not to call evidence in relation to the defences.
The insured's submission was upheld, and being of opinion that the insured had made out its case for indemnity, the judge entered judgment for it.
37 On appeal it was contended by the appellant that, in deciding the no case submission, the trial judge "embarked upon the wrong exercise".
It was said his Honour had proceeded as if his function was to reach a final judgment on the facts, with inferences drawn and applied, as if he were deciding at the end of the whole case.
His proper function, it was contended, was to decide whether the evidence before him (treating it in the most favourable way to the defendant) permitted the inferences to be drawn in favour of the affirmative defences, and not to decide whether to draw those inferences.
An alternative argument was that the evidence revealed a prima facie case in respect of each of the defences, sufficient to require an answer by the insured.
38 All members of the Full Court rejected those contentions.
Tadgell J, with whom Fullagar J agreed, distinguished (at 239) between a case where the no case submission is that there is no evidence at all in support of the respondent party's case and one where it is that, although there is some evidence to support it, the judge should not act on it because, for example, it is so unsatisfactory or inherently unreliable or equivocal that he should find that the burden of proof resting on the respondent party has not been discharged.
His Honour went on (at 239):
 
 "If a judge sitting alone receives a submission of the second kind and decides to rule on it, whether the moving party is put to or makes his election or not, he must be entitled in doing so to assess the quality of the evidence.
Were it otherwise the Judge, being the tribunal of fact, would be placed in an impossible position: he would have to assess the validity of the case for the respondent party without being able to assess the worth or weight of the evidence led in support of it.
It has been said that 'when there is no jury, the proposition 'no case to answer' may obviously mean far more than, 'is there evidence on which a jury could find for the plaintiff?
' It merely means, would you, the Judge, on the evidence given, find for the plaintiff?
'" 
 

See also per Young CJ at 215.
39 This approach has been approved in many cases.
See, for example, Rasomen at
508-509, Merry at 8 and Sarkis v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation [2005] VSCA 67 at [14] .
40 Accordingly, I proceed on the basis that my present function is no different from that which has to be performed by a judge who has heard all the evidence in the ordinary way, and who has to give final judgment.
In both situations, a judge must make findings of fact, after assessing the quality of the evidence.
THE NO CASE SUBMISSION 
 
41 In order to succeed, the plaintiffs must before anything else show that Chick Vic was insolvent at the times it incurred the debts they seek to recover or that it became insolvent by incurring the same.
