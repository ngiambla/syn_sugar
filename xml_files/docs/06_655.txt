 
 1 In 1997, 1998 and 1999 the applicant, Mr Shane Day ('the Taxpayer'), was employed as a senior compliance officer with the Australian Customs Service ('Customs').
As such, he was an ' officer ' for the purposes of the Public Service Act 1922 (Cth) ('the Public Service Act').
This proceeding raises the question of whether legal expenses incurred in resisting charges made against the Taxpayer under the Public Service Act, alleging improper conduct as an officer and failing to fulfil his duty as an officer, should be allowed as deductions from the Taxpayer's assessable income for the purposes of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 (Cth) ('the Assessment Act').
The proceeding is an appeal against a decision by the respondent, the Commissioner of Taxation ('the Commissioner'), on an objection by the Taxpayer against an assessment to tax for the year ended 30 June 2002.
THE PUBLIC SERVICE ACT 
 
2 Section 61(2) of the Public Service Act relevantly provided that, where an officer authorised by the Secretary (as defined in the Public Service Act) is of the opinion that another officer may have failed to fulfil his duty as an officer, that authorised officer shall, if he decides that the other officer should be charged, charge that officer with the failure.
Section 56(d) of the Public Service Act relevantly provided that an officer should be taken to have failed to fulfil his duty as an officer if he engaged in improper conduct as an officer.
Section 56(f)(i) relevantly provided that an officer should be taken to have failed to fulfil his duty as an officer if he contravened, or failed to comply with, a provision of the Regulations that was applicable to him.
Regulation 13(a) of the Public Service Regulations 1935 (Cth) ('the Regulations') relevantly provided that an officer who recorded, as the time of his arrival on duty or at his departure from duty, a time other than the actual time of his arrival on duty or his departure from duty, as the case may be, committed a breach of the Regulations.
Regulation 13(g) also provided that an officer who, being prevented by illness or other emergency from attending for duty, did not, as soon as he may do so, report the fact to the officer in charge committed a breach of the Regulations.
3 Under s 62(1) of the Public Service Act, where an officer was charged with misconduct under s 61, an inquiry was to be held into the charge by an officer appointed for that purpose by the Secretary.
Under s 62(6), where the officer holding such an inquiry ('the inquiry officer') was satisfied that the officer charged had failed to fulfil his duty as an officer, the inquiry officer could direct that certain action be taken in respect of the officer, including action by way of reducing the salary of the officer and transferring the officer to another position with Customs.
Under s 63D(2) of the Public Service Act, an officer could appeal to a Disciplinary Appeal Committee against a decision made under s 62(6) by an inquiry officer.
THE FIRST CHARGE 
 
4 On 23 September 1998, Ms Karen Suzanne Williams, an authorised officer of Customs, gave written notice to the Taxpayer of a charge pursuant to s 61(2) of the Public Service Act of having failed to fulfil his duty as an officer within the meaning of s 56(d) ('the First Charge').
On 23 September 1998, the Taxpayer also was given notice of suspension but continued to receive regular pay in respect of his accrued leave and similar entitlements.
On 1 February 1999, the Taxpayer was given notice of removal of suspension and from that day his pay was no longer taken out of accrued entitlements but was paid as ordinary salary.
5 Under the heading ' Official Identification and Security Items ' in the Customs Code of Ethics and Conduct, the following is stated:
 
 'Identity badges and passes are issued to assist and identify officers in the performance of their duties, and in exercising powers entrusted to them.
They are not to be used for any other purpose.
' 

The First Charge was that, on 21 September 1998, the Taxpayer breached the standards of conduct for Customs officers, in that he presented his official Customs identification card to gain access to one Barbara Baker at the Downing Centre Local Court in Sydney, in order to obtain information regarding a search warrant, which had been executed on Customs on 28 July 1998.
6 The relevant inquiry officer found that it was improper in the circumstances for the Taxpayer to ask to see Ms Barbara Baker, presenting his official identification card in order to secure her attendance.
The inquiry officer considered that it was improper of the Taxpayer to convey the impression that the inquiry that he wished to make of Ms Baker had an official purpose, in circumstances where the Taxpayer's attendance upon Ms Baker was not in fact work related.
By notice dated 10 December 1998, the inquiry officer directed, under s 62(6) of the Public Service Act, that the Taxpayer be demoted to a position identified in the notice with a salary identified in the notice.
7 The Taxpayer exercised his right of appeal to a Disciplinary Appeal Committee.
On 24 February 1999, the Disciplinary Appeal Committee found that the First Charge was proven, but varied the direction against which the appeal was made to a direction that the Taxpayer be transferred to another position at the top salary point for the relevant band.
8 The Taxpayer then applied to the Federal Court for orders under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 (Cth) ('the Judicial Review Act') in respect of the decision of the Disciplinary Appeal Committee.
On 22 October 1999, Gyles J ordered that the decision of 24 February 1999 be set aside and that the matter be remitted to a Disciplinary Appeal Committee to be heard according to law (see [1999] FCA 1444).
His Honour ordered the second respondent, the Commonwealth, to pay the costs of the proceeding and directed that the costs of the appeal to the Disciplinary Appeal Committee be reserved for consideration after the further rehearing.
The Commonwealth appealed from the orders of Gyles J.
On 13 April 2000, a Full Court dismissed the appeal with costs (see [2000] FCA 474).
9 The matter that was remitted to the Disciplinary Appeal Committee was heard on 11 September 2000.
On 28 December 2000, the Disciplinary Appeal Committee set aside the direction of the inquiry officer of 10 December 1998 and ordered the Commonwealth to pay the Taxpayer's costs.
As a consequence of the determination of 28 December 2000, the Taxpayer received full credit for entitlements that had been withheld from him.
10 At the first hearing before the Disciplinary Appeal Committee, the Taxpayer was represented by Mr P. Roberts SC, who also gave advice to the Taxpayer.
Following the decision of that Disciplinary Appeal Committee, the Taxpayer sought advice from Mr Roberts about the decision.
Mr Roberts also appeared for the Taxpayer before Gyles J and in the Full Federal Court and at the hearing of the remitted matter before the Disciplinary Appeal Committee.
Mr Roberts was instructed to appear on behalf of the Taxpayer by Mr James Hasson, solicitor, who did not charge fees to the Taxpayer.
Mr Roberts rendered fees to Mr Hasson for his appearances and advice, which the Taxpayer paid.
It is agreed between the parties that the total of the fees paid to Mr Roberts that are attributable to the proceedings involving the First Charge was $27,386.
After giving credit for the sum of $19,483 recovered under costs orders, the amount effectively claimed as a deduction in respect of the First Charge is $7,903.
SECOND CHARGES 
 
11 On 13 November 1998, Ms Williams gave written notice to the Taxpayer of further charges under s 61 of the Public Service Act ('the Second Charges').
There were twelve separate charges involved.
Two of those charges were later withdrawn and replaced on 16 January 1999 and 3 February 1999 with similar charges.
All of the Second Charges related to alleged failures on the part of the Taxpayer, on various dates in 1997 and 1998, to fulfil his duty, under s 56(f)(i) of the Public Service Act, in so far as he failed to comply with the provisions of Regulation 13.
The charges alleged that he did not accurately record attendance in connection with his employment.
12 By way of example, one of the Second Charges alleged that on 18 December 1997, the Taxpayer did not accurately record his attendance on his attendance record for that day.
A statement of facts was attached to the charge.
The statement of facts said as follows:
 
 'About 08:41 on 18 September 1997, Shane Anthony DAY checked into the Airport Sydney International Motor Inn (Airport Sydney).
DAY paid the amount of $79.00 cash for the use of a room at the "day use" rate, and was allocated room 231.
"Day use" allows the tenant to occupy the room between the hours of 09:00 and 18:00.

 
 At the time of checking in to the Airport Sydney DAY completed a Guest Registration card.
On this card DAY provided the address 12 Punch Street, Mosman, 2088.
DAY advised the receptionist that he would check out between 17:30 and 18:00.

 
 An examination of the Sydney street directory shows that there is no "Punch" Street, Mosman.
DAY resides at 90 Boyce Road, Maroubra.

 
 Airport Sydney computer records show DAY checked out of the Airport Sydney at 16:12.

 
 Management at the Airport Sydney advises that room 231 had been occupied between the hours of 09:00 and 18:00.

 
 DAY's attendance record (flex sheet) shows DAY certifies that on 18 September1997, he was on duty between the hours 09:15 to 12:30 and 13:00 to 16:50.
' 
 

13 The inquiry officer in relation to the Second Charges gave a decision on 2 August 1999 that he was satisfied that the majority of the Second Charges were proven.
Separate directions were given in relation to each of the Second Charges that was found proven.
For example, in relation to the charge particularised above, the inquiry officer found that the Taxpayer was not on Customs premises on the afternoon of 18 September 1997.
The inquiry officer found that, while it was impossible to note precisely the time that the Taxpayer left work on the day in question, it seemed reasonable to assume that he left at about 12.30 pm.
The inquiry officer therefore concluded that the Taxpayer did not accurately record his attendance on the day in question and that there was a discrepancy of three hours and fifty minutes in the flexitime sheet completed by him.
The inquiry officer was satisfied that that amounted to a breach of Regulation 13(a) of the Public Service Regulations and therefore found that the charge was proven.
14 On 2 August 1999, the inquiry officer directed, under s 62(6) of the Public Service Act, that $400 be deducted from the Taxpayer's salary in respect of the failure to fulfil his duty in respect of his attendance record for 18 September 1997.
Similar findings and directions were given in relation to the other of the Second Charges that were found proven.
In addition, the inquiry officer directed that the Taxpayer be subject to counselling and demotion.
15 The Taxpayer appealed to the Disciplinary Appeal Committee.
Mr Hasson retained Mr Andrew Bell of counsel to advise the Taxpayer in conference on 19 October 2001 in relation to the appeal.
The Taxpayer paid fees of $220 to Mr Bell.
16 At the hearing before the Disciplinary Appeal Committee, the Taxpayer was represented by Mr Hasson, who did not charge him any fees.
On 11 February 2002, the Disciplinary Appeal Committee varied the decision of the inquiry officer.
In respect of each of the charges found proved, the Taxpayer was to be transferred to a position at another level and paid the salary payable to an officer at the top of the salary range for that level.
That transfer represented a demotion and a reduction in remuneration.
The Taxpayer applied for review of that decision under the Judicial Review Act.
However, no fees are claimed as deductions in the year ended 30 June 2002 in respect of that proceeding.
THIRD CHARGES 
 
17 At some stage in 1997 and 1998, members of the Australian Federal Police and officers of the Internal Affairs Unit of Customs were engaged in a joint criminal investigation.
In the course of that investigation, officers of the Australian Federal Police carried out telephonic interceptions of telephones used by the Taxpayer at both his place of work and at his home, pursuant to one or more warrants issued under the Telecommunications (Interception) Act 1979 (Cth) ('the Interception Act').
Ten telephone conversations occurring between 9 December 1997 and 12 June 1998 were intercepted.
18 Customs requested the Australian Federal Police release transcripts of the product of such telephonic interceptions for use in connection with possible disciplinary action against the Taxpayer.
The Australian Federal Police agreed to that request.
Ms Williams was given the transcripts for the purpose of deciding whether the Taxpayer may have failed to fulfil his duty as an officer and whether he should be charged under s 61(2) of the Public Service Act.
19 On 22 March 1999, Ms Williams gave the Taxpayer notice of seven further charges under s 61 of the Public Service Act ('the Third Charges').
The Third Charges alleged that the Taxpayer had failed to fulfil his duty as an officer within the meaning of s 56(d) at various times from 1997 to 1999, particulars of which were set out in charge sheets.
The transcripts were also supplied to the relevant inquiry officer, following the laying of the Third Charges against the Taxpayer.
20 Three of the charges related to claims for a diesel fuel rebate by Mr Tony Panto, the partner of Ms Angela Blake.
It was alleged that the Taxpayer failed to inform Customs of information in that regard, lent improper support and assistance to Ms Blake in connection with Mr Panto's claim for diesel fuel rebate and was knowingly concerned in the creation of a diary for use in connection with an audit of Mr Panto's claims for diesel fuel rebate.
A further charge was that the Taxpayer secured access to, and organised the use of, a work vehicle for a purpose that included the collection and transportation of his daughter for a non-work related purpose by a fellow officer.
Two further charges involve deception and false attendance records concerning 12 June 1998 when the Taxpayer was absent from his workplace.
The final charge involved alleged failure by the Taxpayer to inform Customs of various matters concerning an investigation into a Mr Dennis Partridge.
21 On 24 August 1999, the Taxpayer commenced a proceeding in the Federal Court.
An amended application was filed on 13 October 1999.
In the proceeding, the Taxpayer alleged that officers of the Australian Federal Police had, under warrant, intercepted the Taxpayer's telephone calls at work and at home as part of a criminal investigation and that information obtained from those interceptions had been conveyed to officers of Customs, including Ms Williams.
The Taxpayer sought orders that the Third Charges be set aside and that the inquiry under s 62 of the Public Service Act stayed and a declaration made that the communication by the Australian Federal Police to Customs of the product of the telephonic interceptions was unlawful.
The Taxpayer also claimed damages under s 107A(4) of the Interception Act.
22 On 31 March 2000, after a hearing on 3 November 1999, Einfeld J dismissed the Taxpayer's application with costs (see Day v Commissioner of Australian Federal Police (2000) 96 IR 240).
The Taxpayer appealed to the Full Court and, after a hearing on 31 August 2000, the Full Court dismissed the appeal with costs on 11 September (see Day v Commissioner, Australian Federal Police [2000] FCA 1272 ; (2000) 101 FCR 66).
On 9 October 2000, the Taxpayer filed an application to the High Court for special leave to appeal.
That application was subsequently dismissed with costs.
23 In connection with the proceeding before Einfeld J, the Full Court and the High Court, the Taxpayer was represented by Mr Roberts SC on instructions from Mr Hasson.
In addition, Mr Hasson retained Mr Stephen Gageler SC to advise and represent the Taxpayer in connection with the application to the High Court.
It is agreed between the parties that the total of the fees paid to Mr Roberts that are attributable to those appearances is $23,014 and that the Taxpayer incurred expenses to Mr Gageler SC in the sum of $5,940 in relation to his appearances and advice.
ASSESSMENT AND OBJECTIONS 
 
24 On 1 November 2002, a tax return was lodged on behalf of the Taxpayer in respect of the year ended 30 June 2002.
In that return, the Taxpayer did not claim a deduction for the legal expenses now under consideration.
On 7 November 2002, the Commissioner issued a notice of assessment for the year ended 30 June 2002.
On 12 November 2004, the Taxpayer lodged an objection against that assessment, saying that the sum of $37,077 should have been allowed as a deduction from his assessable income for the year ended 30 June 2002.
On 19 April 2005, the Commissioner disallowed the objection.
25 This proceeding was commenced on 17 June 2005, by way of appeal under s 14ZZ(a)(ii) of the Taxation Administration Act 1953 (Cth) ('the Administration Act') against the Commissioner's objection decision of 19 April 2005.
