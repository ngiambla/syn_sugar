 
1 This is an application for review from a decision of the Migration Review Tribunal ('the Tribunal') made on 22 November 2004.
In that decision the Tribunal affirmed the decision of a delegate of the first respondent refusing to grant to the applicant a subclass 853 Remaining Relative visa.
2 The Tribunal is joined as second respondent on the basis it will abide the decision of the Court.
References in these reasons to 'the respondent' are therefore to be understood as referrable to the first respondent.
BACKGROUND 
 
3 The applicant is a citizen of the United Kingdom who was born on 26 October 1981.
On 6 September 1998 the applicant entered Australia as the holder of a subclass 976 Visitor visa.
On 7 April 1999 he was granted a subclass 457 visa, valid until 21 October 2001, as a dependent associated with an application and grant of visa to his father, Mr Gary Elliott.
4 The applicant has not left Australia since his arrival on 6 September 1998.
On 19 October 2001 the applicant's father applied for a subclass 856 visa.
The secondary applicants included the applicant's father's spouse, Ms Dianne Gleghorn, their son Thomas and the applicant.
On the same date, the applicant was granted a Bridging A visa valid until 16 October 2002.
On 11 October 2002 the applicant was granted a further Bridging A visa.
5 On 1 September 2002 the applicant's father advised the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs ('the Department') that the applicant could not be classified as a dependent child and the applicant withdrew from his father's application for a subclass 856 visa on 18 September 2002.
6 On 17 October 2002 the applicant applied for an Other Family (Residence) (Class BU) visa seeking a subclass 835 Remaining Relative visa.
In the section of the application form requiring details of the applicant's family members, the applicant included his mother, Cathy Payton, and two half-sisters, Kerry Payton and Nicola Swarbrick.
The applicant gave their country of current residence as England.
7 A delegate of the first respondent made a decision on 17 February 2004 refusing to grant the applicant a subclass 853 Remaining Relative visa.
The delegate concluded that because the applicant usually resided in Australia, he did not satisfy the requirements of subreg 1.15(1)(c)(i) of the Migration Regulations 1994 (Cth) ('the Migration Regulations '), and therefore could not be a remaining relative.
On 10 March 2004 the applicant lodged an application with the Migration Review Tribunal ('the Tribunal') seeking review of the delegate's decision.
8 The Tribunal hearing was held on 30 August 2004 at which the applicant and his father gave oral evidence.
The decision affirming the delegate's decision adverse to the applicant was made on 22 November 2004.
GROUNDS OF REVIEW 
 
9 On 24 December 2004 the applicant lodged an application with the Federal Court of Australia pursuant to s 39B of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth) for review of the Tribunal's decision.
The grounds of the application are:
 
 
 '1.
In making or purporting to make the decision the Tribunal acted without or in excess of jurisdiction in that it failed to understand and to apply the definition of remaining relative in Regulation 1.15 of the Migration Regulations 1994 ("the Regulations ") made applicable by Item 1123B in Schedule 1 to the Regulations and Part 835 of Schedule 2 to the Regulations , and thereby asked itself the wrong question or failed to ask itself the right, or a right, question.
[particulars omitted]
 2..
If (which is denied) the Tribunal did as part of its decision-making process ask itself the question of whether the Applicant had not had contact with his overseas near relatives within a reasonable period before making his application, and to address that matter, in so doing the Tribunal acted without or in excess of jurisdiction.
[particulars omitted] 
 

10 In the particulars to the grounds of the application, the applicant contends that the Tribunal wrongly interpreted subreg 1.15(1)(c)(i) of the Migration Regulations to mean that if he was at the time of application residing in Australia, then ipso facto he could not be a remaining relative .
The particulars further allege that in relation to subreg 1.15(1)(c)(ii) the Tribunal failed to ask itself the right question, wrongly directed itself as to certain matters, and addressed the wrong question.
11 The hearing of the application on 29 June 2005 was adjourned to 19 October 2005 to enable the parties to file further written submissions following the delivery of the decision of the Full Court in relation to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affair's appeal from the decision of Spender J in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v Hidalgo [2005] FCA 437 , which was listed for hearing on 22 August 2005.
12 On 22 August 2005 the Full Court heard the Hidalgo appeal and on that same date the Court ordered that the appeal be dismissed: Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v Hidalgo [2005] FCAFC 192.
The Full Court's reasons for judgment were published on 12 September 2005.
REGULATORY FRAMEWORK 
 
13 Clause 835.212 of Sch 2 of the Migration Regulations in relation to the criteria to be satisfied at the time of application for a subclass 835 Remaining Relative visa provides that:
 
 
 
 '835.212 The applicant is a remaining relative of an Australian relative.
' 
 
 

14 The term 'remaining relative' is defined in reg 1.15.
Subregulation 1.15(1) relevantly provides that:
 
 '(1) An applicant for a visa is a remaining relative of another person who is an Australian citizen, an Australian permanent resident or an eligible New Zealand citizen if the applicant satisfies the Minister that: 
 
 
 
 (a) the other person is a parent, brother, sister, step-parent, step-brother or step-sister of the applicant; and 
 (b) the other person is usually resident in Australia; and 
 (c) if the applicant or the applicant's spouse (if any) has an overseas near relative: 
 
 
 
 (i) the applicant and the applicant's spouse (if any) usually reside in a country, not being Australia, that is different to the country in which that relative resides; and 
 (ii) neither the applicant nor the applicant's spouse (if any) have had contact with that relative within a reasonable period before making the application; and 
 
 
 
 (d) the applicant and the applicant's spouse (if any) together have not more than 3 overseas near relatives; and 
 (e) ...' 
 
 

15 The expression 'overseas near relative' in subreg 1.15(1) is in turn defined in subreg 1.15(2) as follows:
 
 'In this regulation: 
 
 
 overseas near relative , in relation to an applicant, means a person who is: 
 (a) a parent, brother, sister, step-parent, step-brother or step-sister of the applicant or of the applicant's spouse (if any); or 
 (b) ... 
 
 
 other than a relative of that kind who: 
 
 
 (c) is an Australian citizen, an Australian permanent resident or an eligible New Zealand citizen; and 
 (d) is usually resident in Australia.
' 
 

16 Subregulation 1.15(3) is concerned with the onus of establishing the country of residence of an overseas near relative.
It states that:
 
 'For the purposes of paragraphs 1(c) and (d), an overseas near relative is taken to reside in his or her last known country of residence unless the applicant satisfies the Minister that the relative resides in another country.
' 

17 Regulation 1.15 as presently in force came into effect from 1 November 1999 pursuant to amendments made by the Migration Amendment Regulations 1999 (No.
13) SR No.
259.
Prior to those amendments, subreg 1.15(1) provided that an applicant was a remaining relative if the applicant had a relative of the same kind as is specified in the present subreg 1.15(1)(a) who was usually resident in Australia, unless the applicant was disqualified under subreg (2).
The former subreg 1.15(2)(a) provided that:
 
 '(2) An applicant is disqualified if: 
 
 
 
 (a) the applicant or the spouse (if any) of the applicant: 
 
 
 
 (i) usually resides in the same country, not being Australia, as an overseas near relative; or 
 (ii) has had contact with an overseas near relative during a reasonable period preceding the application; or ...' 
 CONSTRUCTION OF SUBREGULATION 1.15(1)(c)(i) 
 
18 In dismissing the Minister's appeal from the decision of Spender J in Hidalgo , the Full Court held that in the event that a visa applicant usually resides in Australia only, the criterion under subreg 1.15(1)(c)(i) of the Migration Regulations simply does not apply because the circumstances to which it is intended to apply do not arise: see French J at [12]-[14] with whom Finn and Hely JJ.
19 As a result of the Full Court's decision in Hidalgo , the respondent concedes that the Tribunal erred in its construction of subreg 1.15(1)(c)(i).
As the Tribunal was satisfied that the applicant was usually resident in Australia at the time of his visa application and at the time of the Tribunal's decision and that his overseas near relatives were usually resident in the United Kingdom at the time of application and at the time of decision (at [43] and [44]), the applicant met the requirements of subreg 1.15(1)(c)(i).
Accordingly, ground 1 of the application is made out.
TRIBUNAL'S REASONS 
 
20 Although the Tribunal favoured a construction of subreg 1.15(1)(c)(i) that has now been held by the Full Court in Hidalgo to be erroneous, the Tribunal went on to consider whether, in the event that its interpretation of subreg 1.15(1)(c)(i) was incorrect and the applicant did satisfy its requirements, he also satisfied the requirements of subreg 1.15(1)(c)(ii).
The Tribunal concluded that the applicant did not satisfy subreg 1.15(1)(c)(ii).
The respondent contends there was no jurisdictional error by the Tribunal in reaching that conclusion.
21 The Tribunal said that in order to satisfy subreg 1.15(1)(c)(ii), the visa applicant must not have had any contact with an overseas near relative within a reasonable period before making the application.
22 The Tribunal stated that in assessing the issue of contact, PAM 3 (the policy statement) provided the following guidelines: 
 
 '18.3 Assessing the degree of contact 
 
 
 
 In assessing whether the applicant has (or has not had) contact with an ONR [overseas near relative] , officers must have regard to the following (arising from various court rulings).

 'Contact' does not mean "physical contact" (such as meeting) but rather communication in the sense of a social relationship.
