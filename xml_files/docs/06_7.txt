 
1 On 18 November 2005 I published reasons for judgment in this proceeding; see Communications, Electrical, Electronic, Energy, Information, Postal, Plumbing  Allied Services Union of Australia v ACI Operations Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 1662.
On that day the Court ordered the reinstatement of Mr Colin Williams and deferred consideration of penalty and compensation pending the receipt of written submissions.
These reasons for judgment should be read together with the reasons for judgment published on 18 November 2005.
