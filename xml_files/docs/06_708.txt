I gave orders in respect of the hearing of that Notice of Motion on 9 February.
On 25 May 2006, Mr Shane Coghill filed a document in court which said:
 
 'I Shane Peter Coghill seek leave to discontinue the Motion filed on the 8 th February 2006.
The motion was filed in good faith motivated to assist the Thompson Family in their Native Title interests and in the public interest.
The motion of the 8 th of February was filed under the instructions and insistence of the Thompson Family.
However having failed to get any legal assistance and being advised that the motion is unlikely to succeed in its present form I can no longer pursue this matter.
Accordingly I have been instructed by the Thompson Family to ask the court to discontinue this motion' 
 

2 Mr Michael Neal, of Michael Neal Lawyers, representing the Jagera People, does not object to leave being granted to discontinue that motion, but seeks orders that Mr Coghill pay the costs of the Jagera People in a fixed amount.
The amount they seek, they say, is less than half the cost which they have incurred.
3 The difficulty about the application for costs arises from s 85A of the Native Title Act 1993 (Cth) ('the Act'), this being a proceeding under that Act.
4 In ordinary Federal Court proceedings, where there is a notice of discontinuance filed, in three of the four circumstances referred to in O 22 r 3 Federal Court Rules , being those set down in r2(1)(a), (b) and (c), in the absence of any specific order, the party discontinuing is to pay the costs of the party against whom the discontinued proceedings had been brought.
There is no provision expressed in relation to the circumstance where a matter is discontinued, the leave of the court having been obtained for that respect.
In the case of the grant of leave the court would be conscious of the need to address and make appropriate orders as to costs to meet the justice of the case.
5 Where the matter is one involving the Native Title Act 1993 (Cth), s 85A provides:
 
 '85A Costs 
 
 (1) Unless the Federal Court orders otherwise, each party to a proceeding must bear his or her own costs.



 
Unreasonable conduct 
 
 
 
 

 (2) Without limiting the Court's power to make orders under subsection (1), if the Federal Court is satisfied that a party to a proceeding has, by any unreasonable act or omission, caused another party to incur costs in connection with the institution or conduct of the proceeding, the Court may order the first-mentioned party to pay some or all of those costs.
' 
 

 
6 The effect of s 85A was discussed by Lee J in Ward v Western Australia [1999] FCA 580 ; (1999) 93 FCR 305.
Lee J's observations were picked up by the Full Court of the Federal Court in De Rose v State of South Australia (No 2) [2005] FCAFC 137.
The Court consisted of Wilcox, Sackville and Merkel JJ.
