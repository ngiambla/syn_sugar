 
 1 These eight proceedings are concerned with the question of whether certain expenses incurred by Mr Christopher Bowman and Mr Stephen Ell (together 'the Taxpayers') in connection with the operation of a Beneteau 50 yacht known as ' Athena ' are, for the purposes of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 (Cth) ('the Assessment Act'), allowable deductions from their respective assessable incomes for the years ended 30 June 1998, 30 June 1999, 30 June 2000 and 30 June 2001.
Between December 1997 and April 2001, Athena was employed in pleasure and sightseeing voyages for the public, including tourists and the corporate market.
2 In addition, three of the proceedings are concerned with the question of whether certain expenses incurred by Mr Ell in connection with the operation of a Riviera power boat known as ' Medusa ' are, for tax purposes, allowable deductions from his assessable incomes for the years ended 30 June 1999, 30 June 2000 and 30 June 2001.
3 Each of the proceedings is an appeal under Division 5 of Part IVC of the Taxation Administration Act 1953 (Cth) ('the Administration Act') against appealable objection decisions made by the respondent, the Commissioner of Taxation ('the Commissioner').
By those decisions, the Commissioner disallowed objections lodged by the Taxpayers in relation to income tax assessments issued by the Commissioner to the Taxpayers for the relevant years of income, after the Commissioner had conducted an audit in respect of the Taxpayers.

 THE TAXPAYERS 
 
 4 Mr Bowman was born in 1947 and graduated with honours from the University of New England in 1969 with a Bachelors Degree in Rural Science.
Following graduation, he was employed in the Commonwealth Public Service for approximately 16 years.
Between 1972 and 1988 he was an Australian Trade Commissioner, based in Singapore, New Delhi, Manila and Jakarta.
During that period Mr Bowman was also seconded to AWA Limited ('AWA') for two years.
In 1988, Mr Bowman left the public service and commenced work as an executive with AWA.
From 1988 to 1999, he was the group marketing manager for AWA.
5 Mr Ell was born in 1954.
He graduated from Mitchell College, Bathurst in 1979 with a Bachelors Degree in Business Studies.
He also graduated from the Australian Graduate School of Management in 1987 with a Masters Degree in Business Administration.
From April 1988 to January 1993, Mr Ell was employed as senior business analyst in the Corporate Services Division of AWA.
Mr Ell met Mr Bowman when they were both executives working at AWA in 1988.
6 In 1989, AWA and Serco Limited, a UK company, formed a joint venture company to pursue the ' outsourcing market ' of the Commonwealth government, particularly the Department of Defence.
The joint venture company subsequently came to be known as Serco Australia Pty Limited ('Serco').
Mr Bowman was appointed as the manager of Serco and, in 1991, Mr Ell joined him at Serco.
7 The business of Serco consisted of tendering for the management of particular government and commercial enterprises and reorganising those enterprises by instituting more efficient management practices and computer systems.
Quite often enterprises that were operating at a loss were turned into profit centres by Serco.
The talents of Messrs Ell and Bowman were complementary.
Mr Ell's expertise was in the financial and operational management area.
Mr Bowman's expertise was in marketing and planning growth.
Their professional relationship at Serco was a highly successful one.
During their employment by Serco, Messrs Bowman and Ell developed a close personal relationship.

 THE ACQUISITION AND DISPOSAL OF ATHENA 
 
 8 From the early 1990s, Mr Ell began to take an interest in the charter boat industry.
He sought information from, and spoke to, various people in that industry, operating in both the Whitsunday Islands and in Sydney Harbour.
For example, he obtained packages containing information as to the possible financial return from ownership of a vessel used in the industry.
9 In early 1997, Messrs Bowman and Ell began discussing with each other the possibility of acquiring a yacht.
They said that the acquisition was to be for the purpose of conducting a charter business.
Mr Ell approached Mr Bowman believing that his own financial and operational management skills would complement Mr Bowman's marketing skills and that the combination of their talents would assist in minimising risks from such a venture.
Mr Ell said that, at the time, he believed that he would need to develop new opportunities for himself, in order to deal with the time when his employment with Serco would cease.
10 In February or March 1997, Messrs Ell and Bowman met Mr Trevor Joyce of EastSail, a business carried on at d'Albora Marinas, Rushcutters Bay, NSW ('EastSail').
They had a discussion concerning the possibility of a venture involving a large, fully crewed, charter yacht operating on Sydney Harbour.
Mr Joyce provided them with spreadsheets containing 3 year and 5 year budgeted profit and loss statements and cash flow statements from such operations ('the February/March Spreadsheets').
11 In February 1997, Mr Ell was in communication with Beneteau --- VicSail, another business carried on at d'Albora Marinas, Rushcutters Bay, NSW ('VicSail').
By facsimile communication of 25 February 1997 from Mr Brendan Hunt of VicSail to Mr Ell, VicSail provided a quotation for the supply of a Beneteau 50 yacht.
The quotation contained the following preamble:
 'a) Quote is valid for one month from date above 
 
 
 b) you will remember I recently quoted a saving of 90K on tax, this may be as much as 104K and this is reflected below 
 c) I have also quoted here a boat which is more "owner" orientated.

 d) there is a charter model available sooner but the quoted ex factory date is mid July.

 e) Trevor from EastSail has prepared some interesting figures for you, I understand they will be faxed through.

 f) I have left in some items from previous correspondence which will be needed, and included some extra "aesthetic" options which can be deleted if not required' 
 
 

The total price, with inclusions, after ' Estimated savings on sales tax ' of $104,000, was $676,100.

 12 Mr Ell said that in March 1997 he developed his own spreadsheet, entitled ' Athena Business Plan ', to test the financial viability of a project involving a Beneteau 50 yacht.
Mr Ell said that he developed the spreadsheet independently from the spreadsheets provided by Mr Joyce as he considered himself as having far more experience than Mr Joyce in testing business models and the viability of such models.
Mr Ell was unable to specify precisely when the Athena Business Plan was brought into existence.
He said that he first prepared it in March but that it was a ' work in progress ', which changed from time to time as the project developed.
At some stage, although he could not recall precisely when, Mr Ell prepared another document entitled ' Calculations of "Real" Profit Based on Business Plan '.
I shall return to the spreadsheet and the calculations of real profit later.
13 At some stage Mr Bowman also prepared a document entitled ' Athena Business Plan ', which consisted of a narrative and a spreadsheet.
He said that he prepared his business plan for himself, to get right in his mind the assumptions as to ' the way the thing would work '.
14 On 22 April 1997, Mr Hunt sent to Mr Ell an option list for a Beneteau 50 under cover of the following facsimile communication:
 'As you may know we will have a boat due here in mid June.

 It is an owners version with some custom modifications, blue in colour, with a sports mast.
The 53 is a very attractive boat... 
 Put simply the best way to order and price a 53f5 is to give a [sic] me a clear understanding of the potential use for the boat, I then provide a list of suggested options.
Based on that a "global" figure is then quoted for supply and delivery.
' 
 
 15 On 28 April 1997, Mr Hunt sent a further facsimile communication to Mr Ell saying:
 'Further to interest in the Ben 50, and specifically from your phone call today.
To be specific: 
 1.
Inspection.
I will arrange to have the boat available on Sunday if you can confirm with me Tomorrow, 29/4/97.

 2.
Sales Tax.
Find following the relevant sections of the sales tax act.
You will need to reference this with your accountant to ensure it will be to your advantage to comply.
' 
 

Attached to that facsimile was a copy of, inter alia , Item 59(3) of the First Schedule to the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act 1992 (Cth) ('the Exemptions Act').
Item 59(3) provided an exemption from sales tax for the following:
 
 '59(3) A ship that can be licensed to carry at least 12 adult passengers and is for use by a person ('the exemption user'): 
 
 
 
 (a) mainly in providing regular and scheduled sight-seeing tours to the public for reward in the course of a business carried on by the exemption user; or 
 (b) mainly for long-term leasing to another person who is to use the ship mainly in providing regular and scheduled sight seeing tours to the public in the course of a business carried on by the other person.
' 
 
 
 
 
 16 Mr Ell said that the Beneteau 50 referred to in Mr Hunt's communication of 28 April 1997 was, at that time, in Hamilton Island.
The facsimile was, in effect, an invitation to inspect the boat at Hamilton Island.
Mr Ell subsequently visited Hamilton Island with Mr Hunt to inspect the boat.
17 On 5 May 1997, Mr Hunt sent Mr Ell a further facsimile communication concerning a Beneteau 50.
That communication relevantly said:
 'Further to the visit up North.
I now feel in a position to be much more specific in relation to a boat.
And also elaborate on some issues relating to "modus operandi".
To be specific: 
 1.
Extras.
To include or to discuss the following 
 [Various options were mentioned.
]
 2.
Extra description.
When we next meet I suggest we go over the options in detail.
We have full description for each option.

 3.
Ownership.
I do perceive perhaps a more than causal [sic scilicet, casual] interest in personal use for the boat.
In talking with Trevor and Eastsail, I believe there are some interesting ways in which this can be considered, whilst ensuring a balance between private and commercial use.

 
 Just give me a call to clarify any of the above, or to explore other items.

 ...' 
 
 18 Mr Ell agreed that the reference to ' North ' was a reference to the inspection of the boat at Hamilton Island.
Mr Ell denied, however, that he told Mr Hunt that he had ' more than a casual interest in personal use ' for the boat.
In cross-examination, Mr Ell characterised that reference as Mr Hunt's ' normal sales patter '.
19 Sometime in May 1997, Mr Bowman read a memorandum entitled ' SALES TAX ON CHARTER VESSELS '.
The memorandum was signed ' RSD ' and is dated 20 May 1997.
The memorandum relevantly records the following:
 'I spoke to Nick Hill from Deloittes... regarding this matter.
He has been approached by Stephen Ell but has not advised on the matter yet.
He does not see a conflict as we are both on the same side.

 Basically: 
 
 
 
 1.
Any boat that can carry more than 12 passengers can qualify for exemption.

 2.
They must be used for "regular and scheduled" sightseeing tours.

 ... 
 8.
The rate of sales tax is 22% but note that it does not apply to the full purchase price but only to the manufactured value.

 9.
The owner is required to make a declaration based on his intention.
The declaration cannot be false.
The intention should be supported by adequate documentation including a business plan.
' 
 
 

The identity of the author is not clear.
Mr Bowman denied that the reference in item 9 was the reason for his preparing the Athena Business Plan.

 20 On 23 May 1997, Mr Hunt sent to Mr Ell a further quotation for the supply of a Beneteau 50 yacht.
The total price, with additional fittings, after ' Extra ordinary discount ' of 8 per cent, was $750,056.
The quote indicated that the sales tax component was $115,737.
Mr Hunt said the following in the quotation:
 'Again, I have also quoted here a boat which is more "owner" orientated.
Many extras are based on discussions following test sail at Ham island.
' 
 
 21 Mr Bowman and Mr Ell had discussions with Mr Joyce in early June 1997.
Following those discussion, Mr Joyce prepared a letter to Messrs Ell and Bowman dated 5 June 1997.
The letter relevantly said:
 'Many thanks for your time recently.
I believe it was a very constructive meeting and we look forward to the prospect of working with you on the operation and management of your yacht.

 Firstly some generalities: 
 1.
Operation  Maintenance 
 ... 
 2.
Charter Marketing 
 Eastsail has had a presence on Sydney Harbour as a charter operator for 14 years and our location, profile and reputation place us in a strong position to market your vessel.

 We plan to target the top end of the Sydney corporate market where we believe we can get maximum revenue from minimal usage.
The bulk of this revenue will be generated during the summer months, and more particularly November, December and January.

 We also believe there is an opportunity for a yacht based on Pittwater during the winter, where we might combine with the sea plane operators to fly clients to and from the yacht.

 There is also an existing opportunity within our business for passage trips up and down the east coast of Australia, and for charter in cruising areas like The Whitsundays and further afield in the South Pacific; Fiji, Tonga and New Zealand.

 We will develop a comprehensive marketing plan for our growth into the luxury charter market and would be happy for you to have access to this plan, should you need it for tax or finance purposes.
As you know we are planning to have the larger Houssman 68 join our fleet later in the year and tow [sic] yachts will together form the basis for the development of this business activity.

 We do not believe that operating in the tourism driven scheduled cruise market on Sydney Harbour, which is characteriesd by high volume, low revenue and low margins, will achieve your or our commercial objectives with this yacht.

 3.
Crew 
 ... 
 4.
Berthing 
 ... 
 5.
Personal Use.

 It is critical to us from a revenue standpoint that the yacht be available for charter for as much of the peak season as possible, but this notwithstanding the yacht would be available for unlimited personal use on a stand-by basis.
In particular we would have to be able to charter the yacht on weekends and public holidays during the peak summer season.

 6.

 ... 
 7.
The Management Contract 
 As you know we have revised the basic principles of our management formula to suit your situation.

 The basic components of the revised formula are as follow: 
 1.
All charter revenue would be credited to your account.

 2.
A booking fee of 10% on average will be debited against the revenue to cover commissions paid to third party booking agencies, and the cost of transacting the booking we do ourselves.

 3.
A fixed management fee will be charged as an operating expense, with the fee payable monthly in 12 instalments of $1875 each year.
This management fee will be invested in the marketing of the luxury yacht programme, which in turn will reflect in the commercial success of the investment for you as the owner.

 4.
After payment of all operating and management expenses surplus revenue will be shared, 70% to you as the owner and 30% to Eastsail as the operator.
This amount will be calculated monthly and will appear in your monthly statement of income and expenses.

 5.
In the event that there is a shortfall of revenue versus expenses we would require that such a shortfall is made good at the end of each twelve-month period.

 Upon conclusion of our commercial agreement we will proceed with the re-drafting of our management contract... 
 I look forward to hearing from you.
' 
 
 22 Later in the day, Mr Joyce prepared a further version of that letter.
The second version differed in some significant respects from the earlier version.
The second version, also dated 5 June 1997, relevantly said as follows:
 'Good evening.
Following our earlier meetings and telephone discussions we have developed our proposal for the marketing, operation and management of your Beneteau 50, which we understand you are ready to purchase from Beneteau yachts.
We firmly believe that the venture holds great promise and we look forward to working on it with you.

 Firstly, some generalities; 
 1.
Operation  Maintenance 
 [No change.
]
 2.
Charter Marketing 
 [No change except as indicated]
 As you know we are planning to have the Houssman 68 "Sassafras" join our fleet later in the year and the two yachts will together form the basis for the development of this business activity.

 ... 
 3.
Crew 
 We would provide a certificated skipper and a deck hand for each charter, but the vessel would only be charged with crew expenses when it is actually on charter.

 4.
Berthing 
 ... 
 5.
Personal Use 
 [No change]
 6.

 7.
Profit  Loss, Cash Flows and Finance 
 I have completed some spread sheet exercises which are attached, using some very approximate assumptions at this stage.
For example, I have assumed that the purchase would be 100% financed with an interest only loan secured by assets other than the yacht itself, with the cash surplus at the end of each year applied to reduction of the principal.
For the monthly case flow exercise for year 1 I have assumed that you would make a 221D application so that you could recover the projected loss by way of reduction of PAYE tax instalments.

 We do of course urge that you seek independent financial advice on how best to structure the finance for the acquisition.

 8.
The Management Contract 
 [No change except as to the amounts in items 3 and 4]
 3.
A fixed management fee will be charged as an operating expense, with the fee payable monthly in 12 instalments of $2083 each year... 
 4.
After payment of all operating and management expenses surplus revenue will be shared, 80% to you as the owner and 20% to EastSail as the operator....' 
 
 23 Two spreadsheets dealing with ' PROJECTED CASH FLOW PROFIT / LOSS ' for 3 years were attached to the second version.
They were identical as to revenue but contained different figures in relation to depreciation and interest.
A third spreadsheet was also attached, dealing with ' PROJECTED MONTHLY CASH FLOW ' for 12 months.
I shall say something more about those three spreadsheets ('the June Spreadsheets') later.
24 On 16 June 1997, Mr Hunt sent Mr Ell a further facsimile quotation for supply of a Beneteau 50 yacht, showing a total price, after inclusions and ' extra ordinary discount ', of $694,956.
The facsimile indicated that ' Changes reflect our discussions of last Friday '.
Another quotation, also dated 16 June 1997, shows a total price of $693,656.
The difference is attributable to differences in the inclusions.
25 On 19 June 1997, an agreement for the sale and purchase of a Beneteau 50 yacht was entered into between VicSail, as vendor, and Messrs Ell and Bowman, as purchaser.
The price was described as follows:
 '$617,038 (being quoted price of $694,956 less estimated sales tax of $109,000 plus EastSail's specifications at $31,082.
)' 
 

The price was to be paid as to $20,000 on 27 June 1997, as to $34,000 on handover and as to the balance on completion at factory, stated to be approximately 12 October 1997.

 26 On the same day, 19 June 1997, each of Messrs Ell and Bowman signed a form of ' Quotation of Exemption Declaration ' under the Sales Tax Assessment Act 1992 (Cth).
The declaration referred to ' One new Beneteau 50 yacht ' and the substance of the declaration was as follows:
 'I intend to use the goods described above so as to satisfy Exemption Item 59(3)(a) in Schedule 1 to the Sales Tax (Exemptions  Classifications) Act 1992.
' 
 
 27 On 20 June 1997, Mr Joyce wrote to Mr Ell, saying as follows:
 'Our congratulations on the completion of your contract with Beneteau for the purchase of a Beneteau 50 to be delivered around the end of November.
Assuming there are no delays or complications with commissioning, the yacht should be operational by early December, which means that we should be in a position to catch at least some of the peak Christmas and summer season.

 
 I mentioned to you that we are currently revising our standard management contract to reflect the important differences in the operational scenario for your yacht.
One of these differences, i.e.
operating the vessel on regular and scheduled cruises for sight seeing to comply with the sales tax exemption regulations, will require special provisions in our marketing and operation of the yacht, as follows; 
 
 
 1.
Your yacht will be offered as a key vessel in a luxury yacht programme to be promoted to the domestic corporate and in-bound tourism markets.
EastSail will implement a professionally planned marketing programme to ensure the future financial success of the investment from your point of view.
This will be an expensive exercise and we do not see operation of the yacht being profitable for us in the short term.

 
 We will for example be advertising the yacht in Gryphon magazine which goes to the top 5% income earners in the USA, (circulation 1.5 MM) and the cost of a 1/4 page advertisement is $8000 per annum, plus commission on bookings generated.

 
 We will also be producing a high quality brochure for our corporate programme, which will include luxury charter, and production of this brochure is projected to exceed $20,000 in the first year.

 
 2.
We will be breaking new ground with a an operation on Pittwater.
As you know we have not operated there before, although we are enthusiastic about the potential.

 
 3.
We will to some extent be constrained by the regular and scheduled departure component of the programme, and the fact that we will be limited in terms of the number of passengers we can take on the yacht.

 
 
 On this basis and taking our discussions into account the revised agreement should incorporate the following: 
 
 
 1.
The share of net charter revenue after retail discounts and agent commissions if applicable shall be 50:50, with a minimum payment of $20,000 to EastSail during the fifteen month period from the date of commencement of operation of the yacht on Sydney Harbour, projected for early December 1997.
Reconciliation of this amount with actual income will be completed at the end of this fifteen month period.

 
 Guaranteed payments to EastSail in subsequent years of the management contract will be reviewed, and agreed if necessary, at least 30 days prior to the conclusion of each twelve month period 
 
 EastSail will produce monthly statements of income and expenses during the course of the management contract.
Any deficiency in income relative to expenses will be met during the 30 day period following the date of each statement.

 
 EastSail shall have reasonable access to the yacht for the purpose of market development activities where there is no revenue.
This usage shall not conflict with any revenue generating charter of the yacht.

 
 
 
 2.
All berthing, maintenance and insurance costs will be met by the owners.

 
 3.
The yacht shall have a dedicated pen at d'Albora Marina for the time that it operates on Sydney Harbour.

 
 4.
The management contract will be for a period of three years with an option to renew for a further two years, if required.

 
 5.
EastSail as the operator will have unlimited access to the yacht for charter, during the period that the yacht is based in Sydney.
On Pittwater we see less activity initially but we would also want the freedom to market the yacht without restriction on availability.

 
 
 We would be happy to work on the basis of an exchange of letters until we can formalise the arrangement upon your return from Hong Kong, so if you would sign and return this letter we will commence with our planning immediately.

 
 We look forward to working with you.
' 
 
 28 On 25 June 1997, Mr Ell sent a copy of that letter to Mr Joyce by facsimile.
The copy was signed by Messrs Ell and Bowman.
Mr Bowman wrote the following opposite the reference to ' the dedicated pen at d'Albora Marina ' in item 3:
 'i.e.
Oct --- Mch inclusive, April to Sept Pittwater' 
 
 
 
 29 Messrs Ell and Bowman arranged for finance of the purchase of the Beneteau 50 in the sum of $659,525 through Bank of Western Australia Limited ('WA Bank').
On 6 November 1997, VicSail issued a commercial invoice to WA Bank in that sum, to be paid as follows:
 1.
$AUS411,506 on presentation of Shipping Documents.

 
 
 2.
$AUS248,019 on presentation of acknowledgement of Handover Signed by Applicant.

 
 
 30 The precise arrangements of the financing are not entirely clear.
A letter of 23 July 1997 from Finlease to Mr Ell indicated that WA Bank had given finance approval for the sum of $680,000 over 36 months with a balloon payment of $544,000.
There is no dispute as to the financing or the interest payments that were made by Messrs Bowman and Ell pursuant to the arrangements.
31 Athena was delivered to Sydney in November 1997.
She was commissioned and put in survey, a process that took about six weeks.
32 There is some dispute as to the precise arrangements that appear to have been entered into between Messrs Ell and Bowman on the one hand and EastSail on the other concerning the operation of Athena.
Nothing further was done to formalise the arrangement after the exchange of 20 June 1997 and 25 June 1997 ('the June Exchange').
However, on 20 November 1997, Mr Joyce sent a letter to Mr Ell saying:
 'Following is a draft of our revised management contract.

 
 Once you have had a chance to review the agreement please advise the details of the party to the agreement from your side and we can get it executed.
' 
 

The ' draft of our revised management contract ' enclosed with the letter of 20 November 1997 was an instrument headed ' DRAFT COPY TO MR STEPHEN ELL ' ('the Draft Lease').
The Draft Lease was dated 1 January 1998 and was expressed to be between Mr Ell as ' the Owner ' and EastSail as ' the Hirer '.
The Draft Lease recited that Mr Ell was the owner of the yacht listed in the schedule and had agreed to lease the same by way of demise to EastSail on the terms and conditions contained therein.
The schedule described Athena, together with details of her equipment.

 33 Mr Ell agreed that he read the Draft Lease when he received it.
However, there is no evidence that it was ever signed by either Mr Ell or Mr Bowman.
Mr Bowman said that he did not consider that the Draft Lease fully reflected the arrangement evidenced by the June Exchange.
Mr Ell said that he did not pursue the matter with EastSail as he considered that the Draft Lease was more of a standard contract for EastSail boat owners as compared with the June Exchange.
34 Mr Ell said that he did not think it was of critical importance to tie down with EastSail the matters dealt with by the Draft Lease.
Although he conceded that they had some level of importance, Mr Ell could not recall raising with EastSail any of the matters referred to in the Draft Lease.
There was no further written communication between Messrs Ell and Bowman on the one hand and EastSail on the other concerning the terms of their arrangement in relation to the operation of Athena.
35 On 30 September 2000, after Messrs Ell and Bowman decided to sell Athena, Mr Ell wrote to EastSail, in the following terms:
 'As discussed two weeks ago, Chris Bowman and I have decided to sell Athena and as such, wish to give notice as required under clause 32 of our contract with EastSail.

 
 Would you pleases pass on our thanks and appreciation to all at EastSail for having managed and looked after Athena for the last three years.
' 
 
 36 Messrs Ell and Bowman placed Athena on the market in November 2000.
In March 2001, an offer to buy Athena for $640,000 was made in writing by a Mr Barry Scott.
The offer was made through Vicsail.
That offer was accepted by Mr Bowman on 12 April 2001.
However, for reasons that neither Mr Bowman nor Mr Ell explained, the sale did not proceed.
Athena remained on the market.
Although the arrangements with EastSail had been terminated, Athena was moored near EastSail and continued to be chartered until April 2001.
37 In November 2001, Messrs Ell and Bowman placed Athena with Sydney By Sail Pty Limited, another charter operator ('Sydney By Sail').
Mr Ell said that a formal agreement with Sydney By Sail may have been signed, but he was unable to locate the signed version.
An unsigned version of the agreement that he believed may have been signed was in evidence ('the Sydney By Sail Agreement').
It may be significant that the general thrust of the arrangement with Sydney By Sail is not significantly different from the general thrust of the Draft Lease submitted by EastSail in November 1997.
38 Messrs Ell and Bowman received offers to buy Athena for $550,000 in March 2002 and $525,000 in mid-2002.
Neither proposed sale proceeded.
The Taxpayers finally sold Athena in late 2002 for $475,000.

 THE ACQUISITION AND DISPOSAL OF MEDUSA 
 
 39 In May 1999, Mr Ell purchased Medusa through Lee Dillon Marina at Rushcutters Bay for $400,404.
Mr Ell placed Medusa in charter with EastSail.
Mr Ell said that at that time he was considering methods of building a viable business after he retired from Serco, and the purchase of Medusa was a means of further exploring opportunities in the charter market for luxury vessels.
He decided that Medusa was only to be used in conjunction with a skipper, in order to ensure that the vessel was kept in pristine condition.
Medusa had a large cockpit, which was protected from the weather.
Mr Ell said that he considered that Medusa would fill a void during the winter months when yachts were not generally hired, because of their exposure to the weather.
40 Mr Ell sold Medusa through Lee Dillon Marina for $300,000 in May 2000.
In the intervening period, he received management reports and other documents from EastSail relating to Medusa.

 THE PROFIT AND CASH FLOW PROJECTIONS 
 
 41 Considerable attention was given in oral evidence to the business plans projecting the likely results from the operation of Athena, which Messrs Bowman and Ell claimed to have formulated during 1997.
It is instructive and informative to consider the business plans in conjunction with the spreadsheets provided by Mr Joyce in February 1997 ('the February/March Spreadsheets) and the June Spreadsheets.

 THE FEBRUARY/MARCH SPREADSHEETS 
 
 42 Two of the spreadsheets provided by Mr Joyce are in evidence.
One shows a projection over five years.
The other shows a projection over three years.
Each has a schedule of ' program assumptions ' attached.
43 Each assumes a cost price of $600,000 and a value for depreciation of $585,000.
Each assumes that 100 per cent of the purchase price will be financed, in one case for a term of 60 months and in the other case for a term of 36 months.
An interest rate of 8.15 per cent is assumed for each.
A depreciation rate of 20 per cent of prime cost is also assumed for each projection.
44 Each spreadsheet has an item for ' weekly rental '.
The assumption for the five year spreadsheet is $15,000 while the assumption for the three year spreadsheet is $7,000.
Each also has an item for ' weekly fee for personal use '.
The five year spreadsheet shows figures for personal use for five years as follows: 

$4,181
 
$3,647
 
$3,407
 
$3,172
 
$2,943
The three year spreadsheet shows the following figures for three years:
 
$4,305
 
$3,545
 
$3,018
No explanation was given for those differences.

 45 An item for ' annual rental ' is also included in the spreadsheets.
For the five year spreadsheet, the amount shown is $75,000 per year and for the three year spreadsheet the amount shown is $42,000.
Insurance as a percentage of purchase price is shown in the five year spreadsheet as 0.93 per cent and in the three year spreadsheet as 1.00 per cent.
Finally, there is an item for ' interest for net present value calculation ', of 6 per cent for the five year spreadsheet and 10 per cent for the three year spreadsheet.
46 The five year spreadsheet also contained the following notes:
 'EastSail --- Notes for attachment to budget assumptions 
 
 
 
 1.
The yacht will be purchased and resident in Australia.
Charter fees based on a net return to the owner.

 2.
Operating costs are subject to a signed and written agreement setting out fixed berthing costs and survey fees, with maintenance costs to be clearly defined as to "running costs" and replacement costs".
Insurance could be arranged through a group policy or by the owner.

 3.
Interest is a variable cost depending on the owner's total funding requirements, available security and rate of interest.
Interest is expensed using "Rule 78".

 4.
Depreciation of yachts in Australia is 20% diminishing value method, or 13% prime cost method.
We have selected the 20% DVM for this example.
The DMV [sic] allows a higher initial depreciation claim, reducing over each successive year.
The PCM allows a lower p.a.
claim in the initial years, but remains constant over each year and is consequently higher than the DMV in the later years.

 5.
A recover for personal use may be factored into the equation to: 
 
 
 
 
 show a realistic return for the year: and 
 
 
 
 
 comply with the income tax regulations requiring an "add-back" for the pro-rated part of the year not available for rent to the public.

 The add-back is based on the pro-rated number of weeks of personal use multiplied by the actual operating costs (including interest and depreciation costs).

 6.
A tax saving may be available to owners who can substantiate that the yacht is a bona fide business operation.
Such owners may claim the loss after taking into account depreciation and personal use against other taxable income.
The tax saving will be based on the owner's personal marginal rate of tax.
The current marginal rates of tax in Australia effective 15 November 1993 are: 
 
 
 
 
 Taxable Income $38,000 - $50,000 44.40% 
 Taxable income over $50,000 48.40% 
 
 
 
 
 Tax laws concerning "negative gearing" of boats are complex and owners are advised to obtain independent tax advice on how the investment will effect their personal affairs.
The given example assumes deductibility of the "loss" factor against other taxable income, which may or may not apply to the owner.

 7.
An investment allowance of 10% is applicable to charter boats "purchased" before 1 July 1994.
"Purchased" includes signing a contract to purchase, providing the boat is first used before 1 July 1995.

 
 
 The Company at no time warrants that the given example has Australian Tax Office approval and recommends that prospective owners seek independent income tax advice on this matter.

 47 The five year spreadsheet shows the following results:
 
 
 1 2 3 4 5 6 NET TAXABLE LOSS PROFIT/(LOSS) (198,922) (170,288) (156,894) (143,787) (131,027) 0 Cumulative Cash Flow (Deficiency) (975) (17,010) (40,967) (72,995) (113,274) (413,274) 


The five year spreadsheet contains an estimated net present value of cash flow of $302,262.

 48 The three year spreadsheet shows the following figures:
 
 
 1 2 3 NET TAXABLE PROFIT/(LOSS) (202,852) (161,766) (135,920) Cumulative Cash Flow (Deficiency) (5,386) (31,857) (72,278) 


The three year spreadsheet shows an estimated net present value of cash flow of $361,874.

 49 Curiously, Mr Ell said that he did not pay any attention to the spreadsheets because he was conscious of the fact that Mr Joyce had a vested interest in the Taxpayers' acquiring a yacht.
Accordingly, Mr Ell said, he was not prepared to make any decision based on the spreadsheets.
He said that, for that reason, he intended to prepare his own business plan based on his own experience and methodology.
Mr Bowman also referred to the spreadsheets provided by Mr Joyce but said that, as they gained information during their investigations, Mr Ell developed their own spreadsheet model of the returns they could expect from the business of operating a yacht.

 THE JUNE SPREADSHEETS 
 
 50 The profit/loss spreadsheets sent with the second letter of 5 June 1997 showed the following revenue (page 103 and 104):

 51 Depreciation and interest was then deducted, with a variation depending upon the assumption made as to the amount of the investment.
In one spreadsheet the investment is assumed to be $750,000 and in the other the investment is assumed to be $650,000.
The spreadsheets show the following:
 
 
 NET TAXABLE LOSS 
 Year 1 
 Year 2 
 Year 3 
 
 Investment $750,000 
 214,550 
 205,145 
 188,106 
 
 Investment $650,000 
 186,050 
 177,131 
 160,885 
 
 
 
 52 The two spreadsheets then show a positive cash flow, after taking into account the tax saving on the net deductible loss, on the assumption that individuals are paying tax at the rate of 48.4 per cent.
For the investment of $750,000, the accumulative cash surplus is shown to be $140,900 and for the investment of $650,000, the cumulative cash surplus is shown to be $121,865.
53 The projected monthly cash flow that was enclosed with the letter of 5 June 1997 does not appear to reconcile with either of the profit and loss spreadsheets.
It shows total revenue for 12 months of $55,000 and net charter income of $49,500.

 THE BUSINESS PLANS 
 
 54 Mr Ell's business plan was a spreadsheet showing particulars for each of the twelve months of 1998 and annual amounts for years 1998, 1999, 2000 and 2001.
The annual amounts in the spreadsheet were as follows: 


 Sales 1998 1999 2000 2001 Charter 30000 45000 50000 55000 Day trips 35100 40000 55000 55000

 Profit Before Tax -96050 -81750 -67750 -64750 


 
 55 The assumption in the sales entries is that there will be 10 day trips in the months of January, February, March, April, September, October, November and December and 5 day trips in the months of May, June, July and August.
The number of passengers is 10 in the peak months of February, March, October, November and December and from 5 to 7 in the other months.
Mr Ell explained that his calculation was based on a charge of $45 per passenger for day trips and a fee of $1,000 per day and $700 per half day for charter.
56 It is apparent that, even on the figures adopted by Mr Ell for income from days trips and charter, there would be a total profit over the four years, before depreciation, as follows:
 
 1998: -5,300 1999: 9,000 2000: 23,000 2001: 26,000 Total: 52,700 
 
 
 57 Mr Ell said that he assumed that they would be able to sell Athena for 90 per cent of its purchase price.
On the assumption that the purchase price was $660,000, the sale price would be $600,000, giving a capital loss of $60,000.
After deducting the profit over the four years, the ultimate result would be a loss of $7,300.
58 On the other hand, the owners of Athena would be entitled to claim depreciation at the much greater rate shown in the figures.
After depreciation, if allowable for tax purposes, there would be significant losses for tax purposes for the four years as follows: 
 1998: 96,050 1999: 81,750 2000: 67,750 2001: 64,750 


Of course, upon sale at a price in excess of the depreciated value, the difference between the depreciated value and the sale price would be treated as income, but only in the year of sale, subject to further deferral if there were a ' rollover ' of the investment into another vessel.

 59 Mr Ell understood that, if, at the end of the period, the boat was sold for a price in excess of its depreciated value, that gain would not be returned as assessable income but would be applied to reduce the cost of a replacement boat.
That is to say, there would be a further deferral of tax that would otherwise be payable.
60 Mr Bowman's business plan was a narrative, coupled with a spreadsheet.
The narrative was as follows (p69-70):
 ' Athena Business Plan 
 
 Objective 
 To make a profitable business from yacht chartering.

 To learn the yacht chartering business so that we may be prepared for future expansion.

 
 Method 
 Acquire a yacht that will become the queen of the charter fleet in Sydney Harbour.
