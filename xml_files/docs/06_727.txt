 
1 The applicants commenced the present proceedings on 15 February 2006 by filing an application supported by a statement of claim.
The applicants seek orders restraining the respondent from selling or offering for sale copies of digital versatile discs ('DVDs') embodying certain films, an inquiry into damages and consequential relief.
The statement of claim alleges that the respondent has infringed the copyright or exclusive right to import held by the various applicants in relation to particular cinematograph films.
2 The statement of claim alleges that the respondent has offered for sale imported DVD copies of films, in respect of which various applicants hold the copyright, without the licence of any of the applicants.
It is further alleged that he has done so in circumstances where he knew or ought reasonably to have known that the making of copies in Australia by the importer would have constituted a breach of copyright.
Alternatively, the statement of claim pleads that each of the imported copies of the applicants' films was an 'infringing copy' for the purposes of s 10 of the Copyright Act 1968 (Cth) (' Copyright Act ').
The applicants plead that they fear that unless the respondent is restrained, he will continue to import and sell imported copies of the films without the licence of the applicants.
Accordingly, the applicants say that they are entitled to the relief claimed by them, including injunctive relief: see Copyright Act , s 115(2).
3 The respondent, despite being served with the originating process, failed to enter an appearance by the required date (10 March 2006) or at any time.
The respondent also failed to comply with a direction made by the Court on 10 March 2006 to file his defence no later than 12 May 2006.
4 By a motion filed on 11 May 2006, the applicants seek judgment on default, pursuant to the Federal Court Rules (' FCR '), O 35A r 3(2).
Order 35A r 3(2)(c) provides that if a respondent is in default, and the proceedings were commenced by an application supported by a statement of claim, the Court may:
 
 'give judgment against the respondent for the relief that: 
 
 
 
 (i) the applicant appears entitled to on the statement of claim; and 
 
 (ii) the Court is satisfied it has power to grant'.

 
 
 

5 Order 35A r 2(2) provides that for the purposes of O 35A, a respondent is in default if he or she has not satisfied the applicant's claim and:
 
 
 '(a) the time for the respondent to enter an appearance has expired and the respondent has failed to enter an appearance; or 
 
 (b) the time for the respondent to file a defence has expired and the respondent has failed to file a defence; or 
 ...'.

 

6 I am satisfied that the motion has been duly served upon the respondent and that he has chosen not to appear to oppose the relief sought by the applicants.
I am also satisfied that the respondent has been duly served with the originating process and other documentation in the proceedings and has failed either to enter an appearance or to file a defence in accordance with the Court's directions.
7 Until O 35A was introduced into the FCR in 2004, it was not open to the Court to make an order for a default judgment, except on a motion supported by evidence as to the merits of the application: Luna Park Sydney Pty Limited v Bose [2006] FCA 94 , at [17], per Jacobson J and cases cited there.
