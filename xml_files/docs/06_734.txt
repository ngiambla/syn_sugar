 
 1 This is an appeal against an appealable objection decision made by the Commissioner of Taxation under s 14ZY of the Taxation Administration Act 1953 (Cth) (' TA Act ').
The decision of the Commissioner, served on the applicant on 15 September 2005, disallowed in full the applicant's taxation objection against the private ruling issued to the applicant for the FBT years ended 31 March 2006 to 31 March 2011.
The applicant seeks the following orders from this Court: 
 
 
 1. the Commissioner's decision be set aside, and substituted with the decision that the applicant's taxation objection be allowed in full; and
 2. the objection decision should have been as follows: 
 
 
 
 
 (a) the correct response to Question 1 of the ruling application is that the proposed issue of shares by ABC Learning Centres Limited to the trustee of the Carers Share Plan will not give rise to a fringe benefit in relation to the rulee RMCs (including the applicant); and
 (b) the ruling should be amended accordingly.

 
 
 
 2 The case is viewed as a Test Case by the Commissioner.
Short Minutes of Orders in Respect of Costs were provided in Court by the Commissioner, noting that the applicant and the Commissioner have entered into an arrangement under the Commissioner's Test Case Litigation Program under which the applicant is not required to pay the Commissioner's costs, and under which the Commissioner has agreed to pay the applicant's costs on an agreed basis.
3 Appeals against appealable objection decisions to the Federal Court are permitted by s 14ZZ TA Act , in accordance with Pt IVC Div 5.
In proceedings on an appeal in relation to matters other than assessment, the taxpayer bears the onus of proof that the decision should not have been made or should have been made differently (s 14ZZO(b)(iii) TA Act ).
Where the Court hears an appeal it may make such order in relation to the decision as it thinks fit, including an order confirming or varying the decision (s 14ZZP TA Act ).

 KEY QUESTIONS 
 
 4 In the case before me the applicant is asking the Court to confirm an interpretation of the definition of 'fringe benefit' which has been previously applied in four cases decided by judges of the Federal Court, and to find that that interpretation is applicable in the case now before me.
Further, the applicant is asking the Court to require the Commissioner to rule in accordance with that interpretation.
The foundation of this interpretation is in the judgment of Kiefel J in Essenbourne Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2002] FCA 1577 ; (2002) ATC 5201; (2002) 51 ATR 629 where her Honour held that the definition of 'fringe benefit' as defined by subs 136(1) Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act 1986 (Cth) (' FBTAA ') requires reference to a particular employee in connection with the benefit said to have been provided.
In the absence of reference to a particular employee in connection with the benefit, the benefit provided is not a 'fringe benefit' for the purposes of the FBTAA .
5 I have referred to four cases in which this interpretation has been applied.
These cases are: 
 
 
 1.
Essenbourne Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2002] FCA 1577 ; (2002) ATC 5201; (2002) 51 ATR 629 (a decision of Kiefel J);
 2.
Walstern Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2003] FCA 1428 ; (2003) 138 FCR 1; (2003) 54 ATR 423 (a decision of Hill J);
 3.
Spotlight Stores Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2004] FCA 650 ; (2004) 55 ATR 745; (2004) ATC 4674 (a decision of Merkel J); and
 4.
Caelli Constructions (Vic) Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2005] FCA 1467 ; [2005] 147 FCR 449; (2005) 60 ATR 542; (2005) ATC 4938 (a decision of Kenny J).

 
 
 6 The Commissioner is of the view that the principle as decided in Essenbourne , and subsequently applied, is not correct.
He has made submissions to this effect, referring to Australian Taxation Office Media Release Nat 03/30.
Further, in the Explanation attached to the Private Ruling provided to the applicant, the Commissioner confirmed that his views as expressed in Taxation Ruling 1999/5 remained the ATO position notwithstanding the decision in Essenbourne .
The Commissioner in the case before me is asking the Court to reconsider the interpretation of 'fringe benefit' articulated in Essenbourne .
7 This application, and the position taken by the Commissioner, both practically in disallowing the applicant's objection and legally in his submissions, lead in my view to two key questions which require decision by this Court: 
 
 
 1.
Should this Court apply the interpretation of 'fringe benefit' as applied in Essenbourne , specifically that there will be no fringe benefit unless there is identification of particular employees in connection with the receipt of the benefit?
2.
If the Court should apply that interpretation, was a fringe benefit provided within the meaning of s 136(1) FBTAA in the case before me?
