 
1 Judgment in this matter was delivered on 15 March 2006: Lactos Fresh Pty Ltd v Finishing Services Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 219 ("the primary judgment").
However, the question of the form of the final orders, and issues relating to costs, remain outstanding.
This judgment deals with those matters.
2 The facts surrounding this proceeding are set out in the primary judgment.
Briefly, the applicant is a tenant of industrial premises in Mulgrave, Melbourne ("the premises").
The first respondent is the landlord of those premises.
The first respondent purported to give written notice to the applicant of a rental increase, as was provided for under the terms of the lease ("the notice").
The first respondent attempted to increase the rent significantly.
The applicant failed to object to the notice within 30 days after it was given.
If it had objected within that period, the lease provided for an independent third party to assess the proper rent to be paid.
However, having not objected in time, the lease provided that the rent specified in the notice was the new rent payable.
3 As against the first respondent, the applicant claimed breaches of an implied duty of good faith and fair dealing, and unconscionable conduct in contravention of s 51AA of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) ("the TPA").
On the first day of the trial, the applicant amended its statement of claim to also include a claim that the form of the notice was invalid, or at least to make it clear that this point was being taken.
4 The second respondent is a commercial real estate agent.
At the request of the first respondent, it provided a letter addressed to the first respondent, giving its opinion of the market rental rate applicable to the premises.
This letter was incorporated in the notice as an attachment.
5 As against the second respondent, the applicant claimed it had engaged in misleading or deceptive conduct in contravention of s 52 of the TPA.
6 In the primary judgment, I upheld only one of the applicant's various claims against the first respondent, namely that the form of the notice was defective, and that the notice was therefore invalid.
I found that the applicant would not have succeeded in relation to its claim of unconscionable conduct.
I made no finding as to the applicant's claim for breach of good faith.
7 In addition, in its submissions, the applicant claimed that the notice was invalid as a matter of substance.
This was because, so it was submitted, the first respondent had failed to take into account a series of matters that it was obliged, under the lease, to consider when arriving at its assessment of the proper rent.
I held that the applicant required an amendment to its pleading to make that claim.
I declined to grant leave to make such an amendment.
8 The claim against the second respondent was dismissed, with costs.
9 At the time of handing down the judgment, I made a declaration that the notice was invalid.
However, I ordered that the parties file and serve proposed minutes of orders reflecting the findings made in the judgment, and that there be a further hearing in relation to those final orders, as well as any issues in relation to costs.
10 The primary issue to be resolved in relation to the final relief to which the applicant is entitled, as against the first respondent, arises from the following circumstances.
After the applicant failed to object to the notice in time, the first respondent insisted upon the payment of the increased rent.
Following correspondence passing between the parties, and negotiations being held, the applicant agreed to pay the increased rent "under protest", but indicated that it would proceed to have an independent valuation prepared.
Subsequently, proceedings were instituted.
11 The question to be determined is, having regard to my finding that the notice was invalid, is the applicant entitled to have all, or some portion, of the money that it has paid "under protest" remitted?
12 The matter is complicated by the fact that since the primary judgment was delivered, the first respondent has given a fresh notice, in what appears to be proper form, seeking a rental increase in the same amount as was sought under the original notice, backdated to 1 March 2003, the date from which that original notice was said to be operative ("the further notice").
The applicant objected to that notice, and arrangements have been made for an independent assessment of the proper rent to be undertaken, pursuant to the terms of the lease.
There is an issue as to whether any such assessment can apply retrospectively.
If that course is open, it might render moot the question of the return of the payments made "under protest".
13 The second issue to be resolved as between the applicant and the first respondent is the question of costs.
Given that the applicant was only successful on one of the claims made against the first respondent, and given that that claim was a relatively narrow one, introduced quite late into the proceedings, should the applicant be entitled to all, or only some, of its costs of this proceeding?
14 The only issue remaining to be determined as between the applicant and the second respondent is the question of costs.
The primary issue is whether the second respondent is entitled to have its costs paid on an indemnity, rather than party/party, basis.
A secondary issue is whether the applicant is entitled to have the costs it will have to pay discounted by virtue of the second respondent's conduct in relation to discovery.
IS THE APPLICANT ENTITLED TO HAVE ANY OVERPAID RENT RETURNED TO IT?

 
15 The applicant claims that because the notice was invalid, the first respondent had no right, under the lease, to increase the rent in the way that it did.
The applicant says that it is therefore entitled to have all the monies paid "under protest" repaid.
The amount in question is the difference between what the applicant has paid, and the rent that would have been paid had that notice not been issued.
For convenience sake, I will refer to that amount as "the overpaid rent".
I note there is a dispute between the parties as to the exact quantum of the overpaid rent.
That issue will be dealt with later in these reasons for judgment.
16 In its pleading, the applicant claims that it is entitled to these monies on the basis of "unjust enrichment".
In its submissions, it refers to its entitlement to restitution of the overpaid rent.
The significance, if any, of this choice of terminology will be discussed later in these reasons for judgment.
PRELIMINARY QUESTION INVOLVING THE FURTHER NOTICE 
 
17 The first respondent claims that prior to resolving any question in relation to unjust enrichment or restitution, I should deal with the question of whether the further notice served upon the applicant has retrospective effect.
The first respondent served the further notice on 31 March 2006.
This was approximately two weeks after I delivered the primary judgment.
The further notice was in the following terms:
 
 "The Manager 
 Lactos Fresh Pty Ltd (formerly Nobi Holdings Pty Ltd) 
 42-44 Glenvale Crescent 
 MULGRAVE 3170 
 
 Dear Sir/Madam, 
 
 Re: Rental Review --- 1 March 2003 
 
 We refer to clause 3.2.2 of the lease made 1 September 1999.

 
 The lessor, hereby gives notice to the lessee, pursuant to clause 3.2.2 of the lease made 1 September 1999, that it assesses the proper rent for the premises for the period commencing 1 March 2003 to be $435,920.00 per annum (exclusive of GST) 
 
 Yours faithfully, 
 
 [signed] 
 
 Finishing Services Pty Ltd" 
 

18 The issue I must resolve is whether the further notice can operate with retrospective effect.
If the independent third party assessed the relevant rent to be equal to or greater than that amount assessed by the first respondent, and if that notice could operate retrospectively from a date prior to the date when the applicant commenced paying the increased rent "under protest", the question of restitution could be avoided.
That is, the question would be moot as the applicant would be obliged to pay the increased amount (and perhaps more) to the first respondent by virtue of the further notice.
19 In the primary judgment, I made the following comments in relation to this issue:
 
 "In determining what orders may be appropriate, the parties may wish to consider the applicability of the principles laid down in United Scientific Holdings Ltd v Burnley Borough Council [1978] AC 904 (" United Scientific Holdings ") in relation to the retrospective application of rent reviews completed outside the period provided for under the lease.

 
 In United Scientific Holdings , the House of Lords held that there was nothing in that case that displaced the presumption that strict adherence to the timetables specified in the relevant rent review clauses was not of the essence of the contract.

 
 There were in fact two separate cases decided in United Scientific Holdings .
The first involved a rent review on a 99 year lease.
The review was to occur each ten years after the commencement of the lease, with the new rent to commence on 31 August of that year.
The rent review mechanisms provided that the revised rent was to be determined by agreement, or failing agreement, by arbitration "during the year immediately preceding" the 10 year period to which that rent would relate.
By the end of the first 10 year period, such agreement had not been reached, and nor had the matter been referred to arbitration.

 
 The second case involved a 21 year lease, commencing upon 8 April 1968.
The rent was to be reviewed every seven years.
The relevant machinery provided for the lessor to serve a notice on the lessee, and the lessee to serve a counter-notice accepting the proposal or making a counter-offer.
The parties were then to negotiate.
If agreement had not been reached after a certain time, the lessor was required to appoint an independent valuer.
In this case, the lessor's notice was served within time.
However, no agreement had been reached by the parties, and the lessor failed to appoint an independent valuer within the time provided for under the lease.

 
 In both cases the House of Lords held that time was not of the essence in relation to the clauses in the leases which the lessors had not complied with.
The lessors had not lost the opportunity to have the rent for the next rental period reviewed by virtue of not complying with the time periods set down in the rent review machinery clauses.

 
 The potential significance of the case for this proceeding in terms of any final orders that may be made is as follows.
The House of Lords held that once the relevant terms were complied with (namely an arbitration concluded in the first case and independent valuation conducted in the second case), the new rent would be payable from the date that the lease provided that the new rental period was to commence.
That is, despite the lessors' tardiness, not only did they maintain their rights to rent reviews, but once the rent reviews were completed, the revised rent applied retrospectively as if those reviews had been completed on time.
" 
 

20 The first respondent relies on United Scientific Holdings to assert that the further notice operates retrospectively back to 1 March 2003.
To the extent that it is necessary, it seeks leave to file an amended defence and cross-claim so as to seek the appropriate declaratory relief to this effect.
The declarations sought are that the further notice is valid, and that the rental for the period commencing 1 March 2003 is that which will be determined in accordance with the rent review machinery in the lease (namely the amount assessed as the proper rent by the independent third party).
21 The applicant objects to the Court granting the first respondent leave to file and serve an amended defence and cross-claim.
It submits that it has informed the first respondent since early 2003 that it rejected the validity of the notice, yet the first respondent did not seek to protect its rights by issuing a provisional further notice.
The applicant contends that the first respondent has provided no explanation as to why it did not take this course or plead the issue of its entitlement to do so.
22 The applicant submits that the first respondent is now seeking to implement the rent review machinery relating to independent third party assessment of the proper rent to be paid, despite having rejected the applicant's offer to take this course on 20 March 2003.
At that time, the first respondent rejected the applicant's offer because the first respondent asserted it was entitled to the amount specified in the notice by reason of the applicant not objecting in time, and therefore the first respondent was not bound to submit to any third party assessment of the rent.
23 The applicant also submits that the determination of the issues arising under the cross-claim would require further evidence, and, in any event, would have remote prospects of success.
24 The applicant relies upon the following passage from Lakatoi Universal Pty Ltd v LA Walker [2000] NSWSC 561 at [48] per Einstein J to support its objection to the grant of leave to file and serve an amended defence and cross-claim:
 
 "It is one thing for the court to case manage proceedings in terms of carrying out its best endeavours to ensure that unnecessary multiplicity of proceedings are avoided wherever possible.
It is entirely another thing once a complex hearing extending over some 10 weeks is then followed by detailed findings on a multiplicity of issues binding all the parties, for one party then and only then, to seek to proceed against another party on a cross-claim, relying upon aspects of the judgment to sustain that claim.
" 
 

25 The applicant contends allowing the first respondent to amend its pleading would result in the applicant being required to put on further evidence by way of defence.
It says that it would raise an estoppel defence to the proposed cross-claim, and that would require evidence to be led as to the issue of reliance.
26 The applicant submits that I should take into consideration the fact that an application by it to amend its pleading was rejected in the primary proceeding on the basis that further evidence would need to be led by the respondents in answer the applicant's new claims, and I was not prepared to permit the case to be reopened.
The applicant contends that the same approach should be taken to the first respondent's proposed cross-claim.
27 In response, the first respondent relies upon the fact that the applicant's pleading was only amended to challenge to the validity of the form of the notice on the first day of the trial, and that it had no "notice" that the validity of the form of the notice was at issue.
It submits that it therefore had no reason to issue a further notice, even on a without prejudice basis to its position that the notice was entirely valid.
28 In order to seek the declaratory relief that it does the first respondent is plainly required to seek leave to amend its pleading to include a cross-claim.
There is no other basis upon which I could grant the declaratory relief sought.
29 As I said in the primary judgment when considering the application of the applicant to amend its pleading following the close of evidence, the strength of the case, in relation to the proposed amendment, is a relevant consideration when determining whether to grant leave to amend.
I do not consider that the first respondent's proposed cross-claim has strong prospects of success.
30 In addition to United Scientific Holdings , the first respondent relies upon the decision of the New South Wales Court of Appeal in GR Mailman  Associates Pty Ltd v Wormald (Aust) Pty Ltd (1991) 24 NSWLR 80 per Gleeson CJ as authority for the proposition that time is presumed not to be of the essence in relation to the right to invoke a rent review.
These cases acknowledge that the presumption is rebuttable by sufficient "contra-indications" in the lease itself or the surrounding circumstances.
31 There plainly is such a "contra-indication" in the lease.
Clause 3.2.3 provides:
 
 " FAILURE TO GIVE NOTICE 
 
 The Lessor shall not by reason of the Lessor's failure to give notice of the rent which it proposes by a Review Date or within a reasonable period thereafter forfeit its right under this Clause 3.2 to have the rent reviewed as at the relevant Review Date so long as the notice is given before the next Review Date.
" (emphasis added)
 

32 This clause acknowledges the right of the Lessor to give its notice late, but only if it is served before the next "Review Date".
The key area of dispute between the applicant and the first respondent is how the term "Review Date" should be interpreted.
That term is defined at the commencement of clause 3.2.
Clause 3.2 is headed "Rental Determination".
The following words appear under that heading:
 
 "Where in this lease it is provided that the Annual Rent shall be determined in the manner set out in this clause the following provision shall apply in respect of the period for which such determination is undertaken (the commencement date of such period being hereafter referred to as a "Review Date")..." 
 

33 The clause then goes on to provide two methods for determining the Annual Rent.
Clause 3.2.1 provides:
 
 " LESSOR'S NOTICE 
 
 The Lessor shall be entitled on each anniversary of the Commencement Date of this Lease and of any further term and on the Commencement Date of any further term to serve a written notice upon the Lessee fixing the Annual Rent (subject as herein provided) at an annual increase of 3% per annum (compounding) or by the Annual Rent being adjusted by reference to the Consumer Price Index for the purposes of this clause and clause 3.2.2 whichever is the higher.
The formula for calculating the adjustment of rental by reference to the Consumer Price Index is set out in Schedule 1.
" 
 

34 Clause 3.2.2 provides the second method of determining the rent.
It is described as the "Market Rent Review" and the clause was set out in the primary judgment.
In brief, it provides the machinery for the lessor to give notice to the lessee, every three and a half years, of what it assess to be the proper rent for the premises.
It provides a timetable for the lessee to object to the notice and for a third party valuation procedure to be undertaken.
A notice under clause 3.2.2 may be given "[u]pon any day being not more that six months prior to 1 March 2003 and (if the Lessee exercises its option to renew) not more than 6 months prior to 1 September 2006 and 1 March 2010".
35 The applicant submits that the introductory words to clause 3.2 make it clear that the clause provides two methods for determining rent --- the method set out in clause 3.2.1 and the method set out in 3.2.2.
It contends that the clause makes it plain that the commencement date for a determination conducted under clause 3.2 is described as the "Review Date".
Accordingly, both the commencement date from which a determination under clause 3.2.1 applies, as well the commencement date from which a determination under clause 3.2.2 applies, are "Review Dates".
36 The applicant therefore contends that the next "Review Date" was the date from which any increase in rent applied by virtue of a determination under either clause 3.2.1 or clause 3.2.2.
It points to the fact that the first respondent gave notice on 1 September 2003, pursuant to clause 3.2.1, of a three per cent per annum increase, applicable from the date of that notice.
As a result, the applicant submits that by reason of the first respondent giving a notice under clause 3.2.1 on 1 September 2003, from that date onwards the first respondent was precluded from serving a late notice under 3.2.2.
37 In response, the first respondent contends that clause 3.2.1 actually provides for an automatic increase of three per cent or CPI, whichever is the higher.
As such, the process of rental increase provided for under that clause could not properly be considered a "review", and therefore the commencement date of a rent increase pursuant to 3.2.1 cannot be a "Review Date".
38 There are two, interrelated, issues involved in the first respondent's argument.
First, is clause 3.2.1 is properly characterised as providing for an automatic increase in rent, rather than a "rent review"?
And second, is the objective meaning of "rent review" relevant in circumstances where that term in defined by clause 3.2?
39 Turning to the first question, read in isolation, clause 3.2.1 does not provide for an automatic increase in rent.
Any increase pursuant to this clause appears to be dependent upon the lessor serving a written notice on the lessee.
However, the first respondent points to the "Reference Schedule" to the lease.
Item 11 in this schedule is relevantly in the following terms:
 
 "(a) The commencement rent shall be $244,152.00 per annum.

 
 
 (b) The rent shall be increased annually with an agreed 3% per annum increase or an annual CPI increase whichever is the higher.
Further the rent may increase (subject to clause 3) at the expiration of each 3 1/2 years from the commencement date to a market rental as defined in clause 3 and thereafter shall increase annually at 3% or CPI whichever is the higher until the termination of this lease.

 
 (c) The Lessee will be liable to pay the increased annual rent from the commencement of the year in which it is to take effect whether or not the Lessor has notified it of the amount to which the annual rent has been varied.
However if the Lessee continues to pay rent at the rate of the current annual rent until the Lessor notified it of that amount, it will not for that reason only be in default for non-payment of rent.
When the lessor notified it of the amount, any necessary adjustment is to be made on the day on which rent is next due .
" (emphasis added) 
 
 
 
 

40 Item 11 appears to reflect the provisions of clause 3.2, but suggests that the annual rent increase is automatic.
While item 11 is not specifically referred to in the main body of the lease, it is incorporated in the lease through clause 2, which provides that the lessee pay the rent specified in the Reference Schedule.
41 The first respondent submits that as the annual rental increase provided for under the lease is automatic, it cannot relevantly be described as a "Rent Review".
It relies upon Pasen v Buy-Rite Discounts Pty Ltd (1992) V ConvR |P54-431 in support of this submission.
That case dealt with the issue of whether a provision in a lease was a "rent review clause" for the purposes of s 10 of the Retail Tenancies Act 1986 (Vic).
It was held that a clause that automatically increased the rent over the term of the lease was not a "rent review clause" for the purposes of the legislation.
Brooking J, with whom Marks and Smith JJ agreed, stated (at 65,091):
 
 "In my view, a lease which fixes the rent for the whole of the term by enabling the rent throughout the term to be ascertained from within the four corners of the lease does not, according to the ordinary use of language, provide for a review of the rent if it provides for an increase or increases or decrease or decreases in the rent in the course of the term, whether by way of simply stating the new amount or amounts or by way of requiring a calculation to arrive at the new amounts or amounts.
The rent is fixed by the lease itself throughout the term and the lease in fixing different amounts is not providing for a review of the rent: it is simply fixing a rent which is not uniform throughout the term.
" 
 

42 The first respondent noted Brooking J's use of the term "fix" and the use of that term in 3.2.1 in support of its submission that clause 3.2.1 does not provide for a "Rent Review"
 
43 Ultimately, the hurdle that the first respondent would face in relation to its preferred interpretation of the term "Review Date" is that this term is expressly defined at the beginning of clause 3.2.
Whether the process provided for in clause 3.2.1 can objectively be described as a "rent review" seems to be immaterial to me.
The question that would need to be resolved is not what the ordinary meaning of the term is, but rather what the parties intended it to mean in the context of the lease.
When the lease itself expressly says what the meaning of the term is, regard must be had to that meaning.
44 As a result, my inclination would be to regard the issue of whether clause 3.2.1 operates to provide a rental increase on written notice, or an automatic increase, as immaterial.
Even if clause 3.2.1 was interpreted, by virtue of item 11, as providing for an automatic increase (and my view is that it does, as discussed below under the heading "Quantum of Overpaid Rent"), that automatic increase is most likely defined by clause 3.2 to be a "Rent Review".
45 Without finally resolving the issue, I consider that the first respondent's proposed cross-claim does not have significant prospects of success.
I have taken this into account in considering whether to exercise my discretion to allow the first respondent to amend its pleadings.
I have also taken into account the fact that further evidence would be needed in order to finally determine this issue, particularly in relation to the applicant's defence to the proposed cross-claim.
Such evidence would be led not only after the case had closed, but also after judgment had been given.
There must, at some point, be an end to litigation.
I have some sympathy with the first respondent's complaint that the validity of the notice was only squarely raised just prior to trial.
However, once the matter was raised, there was no barrier to the first respondent seeking leave during the hearing to amend its pleading to incorporate a cross-claim.
46 Accordingly, leave to amend the first respondent's pleadings is refused.
FACTUAL BACKGROUND TO RESTITUTION CLAIM 
 
47 Having determined that the first respondent cannot obtain declaratory relief in relation to the issue of a further notice, the question whether the applicant is entitled to have the overpaid rent remitted to it must be resolved.
48 Before turning to the parties' submissions on the issue of restitution, it is useful to outline the relevant factual background.
49 The first respondent asserted that the increased rent was payable from 1 March 2003, on the basis of the notice it had served late in the previous year.
The increased rent was a sum of approximately $436,000, inclusive of GST, per year.
Previously, the applicant had been paying approximately $275,000 per year.
50 On 6 March 2003, Mr Allen, on behalf of the first respondent, wrote to the applicant in the following terms:
 
 "Re: 42-44 Glenvale Crescent, Mulgrave 
 
 Pursuant to the Lease entered into between this company and your company dated 1 September 1999 pertaining to the above premises, we now give you notice that your company is now in breach of the Lease in that it has failed to pay the proper rent due on 1 March 2003.

 
 Take notice that if this default continues for 14 days from 1 March 2003 this company will exercise its rights pursuant to the Lease .
" (emphasis added)
 

51 Mr Bertrand, on behalf of the applicant, replied by letter to the first respondent on 7 March 2003.
He stated that because of Mr Allen's "unavailability to meet during the relevant period", he was "estopped from relying on the time period set out in clause 3.2.2".
As previously indicated, Mr Bertrand proposed that the parties proceed with an independent valuation of the market rental, pursuant to clause 3.2.2 of the lease.
52 Mr Allen responded to this letter on 12 March 2003.
He stated that the applicant had not objected to the notice within 30 days, and was therefore unable to dispute the increased rent.
The letter concluded by stating:
 
 "At 5.00pm on Friday, 14 March 2003 you will be in breach of the lease with the resulting consequences.
" 
 

53 On 17 March 2006, representatives of the applicant and first respondent met at the premises.
Mr Bertrand took notes of the meeting.
His notes record:
 
 "I ask whether he wants us to leave the premises.

 
 He says that this is the only option if we do not want to pay the amount he wants.
" 
 

54 Mr Allen accepted under cross-examination that he had said words to the effect that the applicant would have to leave the premises if it did not pay the increased rent.
55 On 20 March 2003, Mr Bertrand sent a letter to the first respondent stating "we confirm our position as set out in our letter to you of 7 March 2003".
Mr Bertrand then stated:
 
 "Today, we have made an additional payment of $ 9,116.00.
As such, we have now commenced paying rent at the amount set out in our letter to you of February 3, 2003.
This increased payment is being made as a sign of good faith.
It is, however, an interim measure pending the assessment of the correct amount.

 
 As such, we repeat our request that you implement the provisions of clause 3.2.2(a) of the Lease and request the Australian Institute of Valuers to nominate a member to determine the current fair market rent.
" 
 
 

56 Mr Allen replied to this letter on 31 March 2003, stating that the new rent had been set under the terms of the lease, and rejecting the request for an independent valuation.
57 Mr Bertrand responded the following day, stating "[f]or the record, please note that we do not accept the matters put forward by you".
He went on to say that the applicant would make the rental payments set out in the notice, back paid to 1 March 2003.
He then asserted:
 
 "[w]e are paying these amounts under protest.
We shall now proceed to have an independent valuation obtained as set out in the lease between us.
" 
 

58 Since 1 April 2003, the applicant has paid the increased rental, under protest.
It commenced this proceeding on 17 December 2003.
THE APPLICANT'S SUBMISSIONS IN RELATION TO RESTITUTION 
 
59 In its written submissions, the applicant submits that it is entitled to restitution of the overpaid rent on the basis that the first respondent threatened interference with the applicant's right to quiet enjoyment of the premises, pursuant to the lease, unless it paid the increased rent.
It contended that this compulsion constituted a legal wrong.
60 However, this basis for restitution was not pressed during the hearing.
Rather, the applicant framed its claim as one for money had and received.
It also framed its claim as one for money paid under compulsion.
It recognised that these claims are not necessarily distinct causes of action.
I agree.
The applicant's claim is properly framed as one for restitution for money had and received on the basis of compulsion.
The reasons for this are discussed under the heading of "Consideration" below.
61 The applicant referred to three cases in support of its claim.
The first is Air India v Commonwealth [1977] 1 NSWLR 449, a decision of the New South Wales Court of Appeal.
The facts of the case can be briefly summarised.
The owner of the Sydney International Airport, the Commonwealth, demanded increased rent from the lessees, a number of airlines, purportedly pursuant to their leases.
In general terms, the airlines paid the increased rent, but stated that they may need to challenge the validity of the rent increase.
62 The airlines brought claims for money had and received on the basis of compulsion.
The trial judge found that the Commonwealth had no right to require the payment of increased rent.
However, he refused to order the repayment of the increased rent because he found the payments had been made voluntarily.
That latter finding was the focus of the appeal.
63 The Court of Appeal upheld the trial judge's finding that there had been no compulsion.
It did so on the basis that there was no express threat to forfeit the leases should the increased rent be paid, and that such a threat could not reasonably be implied.
The Court found (at 455):
 
 It hardly seems to be reasonable to fear that the Commonwealth would determine the leases of seven major international airlines servicing Sydney and Australia because of a rent dispute involving the construction of a lease document, when they could be held to their leases and sued to fruitful verdicts.
Bringing about an almost empty and non-productive facility would hardly seem a likely course of action.
" 
 

64 The applicant contends that its case stands in sharp distinction to that of Air India .
It points to the two letters from the first respondent, extracted above, dated 6 and 12 March 2003, and the file note of the conversation of 17 March 2003.
It submits that in its case a clear threat to evict was being made.
65 The second case the applicant relies upon in relation to compulsion is McKay v National Australia Bank Ltd [1998] 4 VR 677.
The appellant in that case claimed he had made an "involuntary payment ... under unlawful compulsion within the principles enunciated in Mason v New South Wales ".
Mason v New South Wales [1959] HCA 5 ; (1959) 102 CLR 108 is a case involving a claim for money had and received on the basis of compulsion.
66 In McKay , Winneke P stated as follows (at 686):
 
 "I venture to suggest that the legal doctrine of involuntary payments made under compulsion or coercion has no application to the facts of this case.
That doctrine, in my view, is limited to circumstances where a party has been wrongfully compelled to make a payment demanded of him by an authority which, ex necessitate, he cannot resist.
Compulsion leading to involuntary payment within the meaning of this doctrine, as I understand it, can only occur where the demand for payment is made under threat of immediate and empowered distress or seizure of the party's property or person so that the party is coerced into making the payment as a matter of necessity.
" (emphasis added)
 

67 The applicant submits Mr Allen's threats to evict come within the test for compulsion articulated by Winneke P. 
 
68 The applicant also drew attention to the statement of Tadgell JA in McKay (at 689):
 
 "To act in response to pressure exerted by another will not be to act involuntarily and so to act under duress unless the pressure is fairly to be regarded by the law as unacceptable.
A means of pressure or influence that the law will regard as unacceptable are various and indefinite and the categories are not closed.
" 
 

69 During oral submissions, I raised the issue of whether compulsion can be found to have occurred where there was nothing to stop an applicant seeking injunctive relief.
The applicant submits that the availability of injunctive relief to the party the subject of compulsion is irrelevant.
It contends that this has to be so, as whenever a party has time to make a payment it also has time to seek an ex parte injunction.
Any party the subject of a wrongful threat could always seek an injunction rather than pay the money over, and, accordingly, an action for money had a received by way of compulsion, at least in respect of threats to property, could never be made out.
70 Lastly, the applicant referred to the decision of Gobbo J in Esso Australia Resources Ltd v Gas and Fuel Corporation of Victoria [1993] 2 VR 99.
His Honour found that Mason v New South Wales (at 105):
 
 "confirmed that a payment is made under duress or compulsion where there is a belief, on reasonable grounds, that non-payment will result in serious consequences such as interference with property rights or with the carrying on of a business .
In the Air India Case , the test required the threat of a step, other than an invocation of legal process, which would cause harm to the payer.
" (emphasis added)
 

71 The applicant submits that it falls squarely within the test for duress and compulsion as formulated by Gobbo J.
THE FIRST RESPONDENT'S SUBMISSIONS IN RELATION TO RESTITUTION 
 
72 The first respondent submits that the applicant has simply stated, in its pleading, that the retention of the overpaid rent would constitute "unjust enrichment".
It contends that "unjust enrichment" is insufficient to give rise to a cause of action or an entitlement to refund the monies paid.
73 Second, the first respondent submits that a prima facie right to recover will be displaced where it would be consistent with good conscience to allow the lessor to retain the overpaid rent.
It referred to the statement of the High Court in David Securities Pty Ltd v Commonwealth Bank of Australia [1992] HCA 48 ; (1992) 175 CLR 353 (at 379) that a defendant "is entitled to raise by way of answer any matter or circumstance which shows that his or her receipt (or retention) of the payment is not unjust".
74 The first respondent contends that if it were ordered to refund the overpaid rent in its entirety, the applicant would obtain a windfall benefit.
It would be a windfall because at the time that this dispute arose, the applicant conceded there should have been a rental increase, at least up to the level assessed by Mr Ned Walsh, whose assessment is discussed in the primary judgment.
75 In support of its submission that it would be unjust to require the landlord to repay the overpaid rent, it referred to Ovidio v Carrideo Nominees Pty Ltd v The Dog Depot Pty Ltd [2006] VSCA 6 , a recent decision of the Victorian Court of Appeal.
76 Ovidio involved the lease of retail premises.
The parties had signed a lease on 14 August 2000.
Section 8 of the Retail Tenancies Reform Act 1998 (Vic) provided that a prospective landlord must give a disclosure statement to the prospective tenant before entering into a lease.
This was not done.
Section 8 also provided that a failure to give a disclosure statement means "the tenant may withhold payment of rent until the end of 7 days after the landlord gives the tenant a copy of the disclosure statement" and "the tenant is not liable to pay the rent attributable to the period before the landlord gave the tenant a copy of the disclosure statement".
77 The landlord belatedly gave the tenant a disclosure statement on 5 May 2003.
Up to this point, the tenant had been ignorant of its rights, and had been paying the rent pursuant to that lease.
The tenant successfully brought an action in the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal ("VCAT") seeking restitution of the rent it had paid since entering into the lease, in its entirety.
The landlord appealed VCAT's decision.
78 The Court of Appeal unanimously found for the landlord.
Chernov JA found for the landlord on two bases.
First, his Honour found that the tenant received "good consideration" for its money, namely exclusive possession of the premises.
Second, Chernov JA held that the landlord had a sound counter-restitutionary claim against the tenant for use and occupation of the premises, the quantum of which was broadly equal to the rent agreed to be paid under the lease.
79 Likewise, Nettle JA found that a claim for money had and received could not be made out where the respondent got the benefit of the use and occupation of the premises.
His Honour also acknowledged the existence of a counter-restitutionary claim.
He found this to be an alternative way of looking at the matter, stating (at [49]):
 
 "an entitlement to sue for "counter restitution" is pro tanto an answer to a claim for restitution.
It follows, at least to that extent, the appellant's retention of the moneys paid as rent would not be unjust .
" (emphasis added)
 

80 By parity of reasoning, the first respondent submits that it is entitled to recover reasonable compensation for the use and occupation of the premises from the applicant, or, alternatively, that it would not be "unjust" for it to retain the overpaid rent.
81 The first respondent submits, as a "fallback position", that if there is to be restitution of the overpaid rent, it should be limited to the difference between the overpaid rent and the figure that the Court determines to the "relevant rent".
It contends that the relevant rent should be determined by averaging the four rental figures identified in [177] of the primary judgment.
I must say I find this suggested method to be a somewhat implausible technique for the Court to adopt in determining what should be the "relevant rent" or "reasonable rent".
However, counsel for the first respondent, Mr O'Callaghan QC, submitted that such an approach was founded in common sense.
82 In relation to the issue of compulsion (which the applicant has to demonstrate in order to receive any restitution, whether partial or the whole, of the overpaid rent), the first respondent submits that a landlord purporting to exercise its rights under the lease cannot constitute an unlawful threat.
That is so, it submits, even if it is misconceived about the correct basis for those rights.
83 In support of this submission, the first respondent relies upon the observation in McKay that the threat to issue legal proceedings or to pursue another legal remedy could "seldom be a wrong in itself".
The Court in McKay said (at 690) that the "proper use of legal process does not constitute duress" and that "the threat to institute a civil action in good faith cannot constitute duress".
It held, by analogy, that a "bona fide threat by a secured creditor to exercise rights conferred by the security can scarcely be relevantly different from a bona fide threat to sue".
The first respondent contends that a bona fide threat by a landlord must fall into the same category.
CONCLUSIONS 
 
84 Before turning to my specific findings, I wish to make some brief comments about the current position in Australia law with respect to restitutionary claims and "unjust enrichment".
85 Historically, what were described as the "common", "indebitatus" or "money" counts were generally seen as an appendage to the law of contract.
The common counts included the action for money had and received, and other actions, such as for quantum meruit.
The common counts were traditionally regarded as being based upon an implied contract theory.
That is, they were based upon the implication of a contract which required the defendant to repay the plaintiff.
Accordingly, the claims were described as "quasi-contractual".
See Goff and Jones, The Law of Restitution (6 th ed, 2002) at [1-002]-[1-004] ("Goff and Jones") and K Mason and JW Carter, Restitution Law in Australia (1995) ("Mason and Carter") at [101]-[109].
Goff and Jones describe quasi-contract as "the most ancient and significant part of restitution" (at [1-001]).
86 In the seminal case of Moses v Macferlan (1760) 97 ER 676, Lord Mansfield identified the specific, but non-exhaustive, instances where the action for money had and received lay.
These were (at 681):
 
 "for money paid by mistake; or upon consideration which happens to fail; or for money got through imposition, (express, or implied); or extortion; or oppression; or an undue advantage taken of the plaintiff's situation, contrary to the laws made for the protection of persons under those circumstances.
" 
 

87 In Ovidio , Chernov JA referred to the history of the action for money had and received in the following terms (at [8]):
 
 "Historically, restitutionary relief was provided by courts of common law, although equitable principles played an important part in moulding the action.
The basis of the claim for money had and received was articulated in the 18 th century by Lord Mansfield in Moses v. Macferlan .
I will deal later with what his Lordship relevantly said in that regard, but for present purposes it is sufficient to mention what is said in the third edition of Bullen  Leake's Precedents of Pleadings about the gist of the action, namely, that a claim for money had and received is "the most comprehensive of all common counts [and is] applicable wherever the defendant has received money which in justice and equity belongs to the plaintiff, under circumstances which render the receipt of it a receipt by the defendant to the use of the plaintiff.
"" (footnotes removed)
 

88 In Pavey  Matthews Pty Ltd v Paul [1987] HCA 5 ; (1987) 162 CLR 221, the High Court rejected implied contract as the theoretical basis for claims in restitution.
Instead, Deane J, with whom Mason and Wilson JJ generally agreed, stated (at 256-7):
 
 "unjust enrichment ... constitutes a unifying legal concept which explains why the law recognizes, in a variety of distinct categories of case , an obligation on the part of a defendant to make fair and just restitution for a benefit derived at the expense of a plaintiff and which assists in the determination, by ordinary processes of legal reasoning, of the question whether the law should, in justice, recognize such an obligation in a new or developing category of case ... " (emphasis added)
 

89 The recognition of a "unifying legal concept" does not, however, render the traditional categories of restitutionary claims, such as the action for money had and received, null and void.
On the contrary, in recent years the High Court, and superior State courts, have chosen to frame claims in restitution within the bounds of these established categories.
See Roxborough v Rothmans of Pall Mall Australia Limited [2001] HCA 68 ; (2001) 208 CLR 516, Baltic Shipping Company v Dillon [1993] HCA 4 ; (1993) 176 CLR 344, David Securities , Pavey  Matthews , Ovidio , McKay (referring to Mason v New South Wales ), and Vickery v JJP Custodians Pty Ltd (2002) 11 BPR 20,333.
90 Roxborough is the most recent High Court case dealing with a claim for restitution.
In that case, five out of six judges referred to the instances identified by Lord Mansfield in Moses v Macferlan where an action for money had and received was recognised to arise.
Gleeson CJ, Gaudron and Hayne J noted (at [15]) that Mason and Carter:
 
 "point out that cases decided in relation to the common indebitatus counts, although they involved an implied contract analysis which is now out of date "form the precedents which make up the legal matrix of restitution law".
" (footnote omitted)
 

91 Despite Deane J's overture in Pavey  Matthews that "unjust enrichment" assists in determining whether the law should recognise new categories of restitution, in David Securities , the majority (Mason CJ, Deane Toohey, Gaudron and McHugh JJ) noted that (at 379):
 
 "it is not legitimate to determine whether an enrichment is unjust by reference to some subjective evaluation of what is fair or unconscionable.
Instead, recovery depends upon the existence of a qualifying or vitiating factor such as mistake, duress or illegality.
" 
 

92 It is therefore clear from the High Court's approach in David Securities and Roxborough that while the categories of restitution are not closed, the "established categories" still provide, at the very least, the starting point for analysing restitutionary claims.
93 In my view, the present case falls squarely within one of those established categories.
The overpaid rent was money had and received on the basis of compulsion or duress.
The first respondent had no right to the payments under the lease.
The payments were only made after the first respondent threatened, both impliedly and expressly, to evict the applicant from the premises if it did not make those payments.
94 The facts of this case are analogous to those in Mason v New South Wales , where the High Court upheld a claim for money had and received on the basis of compulsion.
In that case, the plaintiffs conducted a business transporting goods by road between Victoria and New South Wales.
A New South Wales statute made it an offence to carry goods for consideration without a permit.
That law was, at the relevant time, the subject of a constitutional challenge before the Privy Council for contravening s 92 of the Commonwealth Constitution insofar as it related to interstate trade.
The plaintiffs paid the permit fees "under protest".
The Privy Council upheld the constitutional challenge.
The plaintiffs then sought remittal of their permit fees.
95 The High Court accepted that the plaintiffs had made the payment involuntarily.
Dixon CJ stated (at 115-16):
 
 "The question what should be done pending news of the result was one which obviously concerned State transport authorities as much as it did the carriers themselves.
The plaintiffs made it plain enough that they paid for permits only under a sense of constraint and with the intention of making a claim for a refund of the money if the decision of the Privy Council should uphold the contention that consistently with s. 92 the State could not enforce its demand for the money.
In all these circumstances I think that it is a proper inference that, in the case of each journey in question, the plaintiffs paid the money unwillingly and only because they apprehended on reasonable grounds that without the permit which could not otherwise be obtained officers acting under the authority of the State of New South Wales would or might stop the motor vehicle and refuse to allow it to proceed upon the journey.
" 
 

96 Windeyer J specifically noted in Mason v New South Wales that the availability of injunctive relief will generally not suffice as a defence to compulsion.
His Honour stated (at 145): 
 
 "Payments made as the result of constraint are none the less involuntary because the law might have ultimately provided the payer with a remedy if he were prepared to suffer in the meantime.
... And so generally, in an action at law for the recovery of money illegally exacted by duress of property, a payment will be considered as made under compulsion notwithstanding that the plaintiff might have avoided having to make it by resorting to equity for an injunction".

 

97 While there may be a distinction between threats made by public authorities, and those made by private citizens, in circumstances where the legal basis for those threats turns out to be non-existent, Mason v New South Wales is nonetheless instructive.
It demonstrates that the law does not limit restitution where an applicant theoretically has other options.
In Mason v New South Wales , the other option was to refuse to obtain a permit and risk the resulting consequences, and perhaps seek damages after the handing down of the Privy Council judgment.
In the present case, the applicant could have refused to pay the increased rent and then fought the ensuing legal battle as to eviction (including, presumably, seeking injunctive relief).
In both cases, the alternative options would have had a potentially severe impact on the relevant businesses.
98 Accordingly, I do not accept that a wrongful threat to evict a tenant, even if made in bona fide belief that the landlord has the right to do so under the lease, exempts such a threat from being considered as an "unlawful threat" for the purposes of compulsion or duress.
Where it turns out that the threatening party had no legal basis upon which to make those threats, in these kinds of circumstances the law regards that type of pressure as unlawful, and sufficient to found a claim for restitution.
99 Nor do I consider as relevant the fact the applicant may be considered to achieve a "windfall" by reason of it receiving restitution of the overpaid rent.
The High Court squarely faced this issue in Roxborough , and held that that fact did not prevent a claim in restitution.
100 Roxborough involved a claim for money had and received by retailers of tobacco products against the wholesaler of those products.
The contracts of sale between the parties involved invoices that specified the wholesale price of the products and an additional fee representing an ad valorem license fee imposed by New South Wales state law.
The license fee was subsequently held to be unconstitutional by virtue of it imposing an excise in contravention of s 90 of the Commonwealth Constitution .
The retailers claimed sums equal to the amounts specified in the invoices as the "tobacco license fee", for approximately the month prior to the constitutional decision being handed down.
These amounts had been paid by the retailers, but had been retained by the defendant and not paid to the New South Wales Government.
101 The retailers' claim was upheld by the High Court on the basis that there had been a failure of consideration.
The failure in this case was described by Gummow J at [104] as "the failure to sustain itself of the state of affairs contemplated as a basis for the payments the appellants seek to recover".
Gleeson CJ, Gaudron and Hayne JJ described, at [19], the failure as "the failure of a severable part of the consideration for which the net total amounts shown on the invoices were paid".
102 In Roxborough , there was no suggestion that the retailers would pass on the remitted monies to its customers.
Gleeson CJ, Gaudron and Hayne JJ stated (at [5]):
 
 "[i]n all probability, whoever succeeds in these proceedings will have made a windfall gain.
In the absence of some legislative intervention, the appellants, if they succeed, are unlikely to be obliged to pass on the fruits of their success to the smokers who bore the financial burden of the invalid tax.
For its part, the respondent has collected what was held to be a tax on goods, but it has not had to pay it over to the revenue authorities.
" 
 

103 The Court went on to order repayment by the wholesaler to the retailers of the relevant monies, irrespective of the fact that this would provide the retailers with a "windfall" benefit.
104 I also find the first respondent's reliance upon Ovidio in support of its claim that it would not be unjust for it to retain either all or part of the overpaid rent to be flawed.
The present case is distinguishable from that of Ovidio on a number of grounds.
105 The most obvious point of distinction is that the landlord in Ovidio was found to have a counter-restitutionary claim against the tenant.
Although the first respondent in this case submitted it also had a counter-restitutionary claim against the applicant, I do not see how such a claim could succeed.
It must be remembered that in Ovideo , the effect of finding the tenant was entitled to restitution would have been that it would have had occupancy of the relevant premises for two and a half years for free.
It was in this context that the Victorian Court of Appeal found the landlord would have a counter-restitutionary claim against the tenant for use and occupation of the premises.
106 Those facts are far removed from those in the present case.
The parties in this case agreed to a tenancy on the terms set out in the lease.
The tenant paid rent pursuant to that lease.
The terms of the lease included that the rent be increased if the rental review procedures were followed (at least so far as clause 3.2.2 was concerned).
Those procedures were not adhered to.
Accordingly, in ordering that the applicant is entitled to restitution of the overpaid rent, the parties will actually get exactly what they bargained for under the terms of the lease, and the rent that the applicant has paid (minus the overpaid rent) constitutes good consideration for its tenancy.
In those circumstances, it can hardly be said that the first respondent would have a claim against the applicant for use and occupation of the premises.
107 I do not accept the first respondent's "fall back" submission that I should determine what the "reasonable rent" would have been, and only order restitution of any amount that the applicant has paid over that sum.
The amount by which it would have been "reasonable" to increase the rent is not relevant in these circumstances.
As Deane J stated in Pavey  Matthews (at 256), restitution does not provide "judicial discretion to do whatever idiosyncratic notions of what is fair and just might dictate".
108 The real question is what was the applicant was obliged to pay under the lease?
While the applicant did make an offer to pay increased rent by reference to an independent assessment, the first respondent rejected that offer.
It did so on the assumption that it was entitled to a higher rent.
That assumption proved to be wrong.
Accordingly, the agreement on foot between the parties provided that the rent payable was that which was paid, less the overpaid rent.
The applicant, therefore, did not receive any additional benefit for its payment of the overpaid rent.
109 This finding is fortified when it is considered that, in Ovidio , when the Court came to determine the quantum of the counter-restitutionary claim, that is, what the "reasonable rent" was that the tenant should pay, their Honours had regard to what in fact the parties had bargained for.
They did not themselves embark upon any independent assessment of the reasonable rent (although I acknowledge that there was no evidence before their Honours as to this matter).
This demonstrates the inappropriateness of the Court deciding what a reasonable rental figure would be, when the parties have themselves agreed upon procedures to determine this.
110 For completeness, I note that even if I did seek to determine the "reasonable rent", I do not think averaging the four assessments tendered before me in evidence would be an appropriate way to determine objectively the correct figure.
In such circumstances, the Court would have to determine that figure for itself, albeit with the assistance of the assessments available in the evidence.
111 Turning to the question whether the applicant's restitutionary claim was properly pleaded, I agree that the claim was not pleaded as well as it could have been.
However, Mason and Carter make some salient observations about pleading claims for restitution.
The learned authors state (at [2904]):
 
 "A pleading that asserts in the abstract that P was unjustly enriched at D's expense will usually be struck out.
The authorities require the basis of such an allegation to be explained in the pleading.

 
 In light of the general statements in David Securities Pty Ltd v Commonwealth Bank of Australia , courts have been averse to pleadings which simply appeal to 'idiosyncratic notions of what is fair and just', or which plead generalised claims based on unjust enrichment.

 
 We explain elsewhere why it is legitimate to say that causes of action arise in restitution.
Nevertheless, we are not advocating pleadings which rely merely on 'unjust enrichment', unless the essential facts are set out .
... 
 
 Pleaders are unlikely to allege unjust enrichment in a context devoid of any facts, and the likelihood that the facts pleaded might attract some novel restitutionary claim in this fast-developing area of the law, saw Gummow J refusing to strike out such a pleading in Winterton Constructions Pty Ltd v Hambros Australia Ltd .
" (footnotes removed)
 

112 The applicant pleaded its claim of "unjust enrichment" by reference to the invalidity of the notice.
While it could have more clearly identified the claim as one for restitution on the basis of money had and received, the relevant issue was adequately raised.
In addition, as Mason and Carter point out, there are good reasons not to plead claims in restitution with a great degree of specificity.
In a developing area of the law, where the categories of claims are not closed, an applicant should not shut itself out of making a case for "some novel restitutionary claim", as long as the relevant facts upon which the claim is based are identified.
113 As it turns out, the facts in this case do not "attract some novel restitutionary claim".
They fall squarely within an established category --- an action for money had and received.
However, it is for the above reasons that I am satisfied that the applicant pleaded its claim for restitution adequately.
QUANTUM OF THE OVERPAID RENT 
 
114 The applicant and first respondent are in dispute over the exact amount of money which was overpaid.
