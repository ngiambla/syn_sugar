 
1 On 12 May 2006, I delivered judgment in this matter: Dresna Pty Ltd v Linknarf Management Services Pty Ltd (In Liq) [2006] FCA 540.
I ordered that the application be dismissed, with costs.
The respondents foreshadowed at that time that they wished to apply for costs to be awarded on an indemnity basis.
I gave directions to facilitate the making of such an application.
2 On 19 May 2006, the respondents filed a notice of motion seeking costs on an indemnity basis or, alternatively, on a solicitor/client basis.
They also sought an order that the applicant pay their costs thrown away (by reason of certain amendments made to the applicant's statement of claim) on an indemnity basis, or alternatively, on a solicitor/client basis.
I had previously directed that that application be dealt with after the conclusion of the trial.
