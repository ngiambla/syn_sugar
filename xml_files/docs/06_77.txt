 
1 This is an application for an extension of time to enable the applicant to appeal against a judgment of the Federal Magistrates Court given on 24 January 2005: Tran v Minister for Immigration (No 2) [2005] FMCA 412 (" Tran (No 2) ").
On that date, McInnis FM dismissed an application for judicial review of a decision of a delegate of the respondent Minister dated 6 November 2003.
2 The applicant did not file and serve a notice of appeal within the 21 day period provided for in O 52 r 15(1)(a)(i) of the Federal Court Rules .
The Federal Magistrate was not asked to, and did not, fix any later date for that purpose, pursuant to O 52 r 15(1)(a)(iii).
Nor did the applicant apply to this Court within the 21 day period for further time within which to file and serve a notice of appeal under O 52 r 15(1)(b).
The applicant must therefore rely upon O 52 r 15(2), which provides that this Court may, at any time, "for special reasons" grant leave to file and serve a notice of appeal.
FACTUAL BACKGROUND 
 
3 The applicant is a citizen of Vietnam who arrived in Australia on 30 June 1999 as the holder of a subclass 300 (Prospective Spouse) visa.
4 On 4 February 2000, the applicant applied for permanent residence on the basis of her marriage to Mr Tran Van Cong (the "nominator").
The applicant was granted a subclass 820 visa ("temporary spouse visa") on 9 February 2000.
5 By a statutory declaration made on 1 May 2000, the nominator stated that the applicant had left him and that he no longer supported her application for permanent residence.
On 24 June 2000, the nominator made a further statutory declaration in which he stated that the applicant had resumed living with him, and that he wished to "withdraw" his earlier statutory declaration.
6 Between April 2002 and June 2003, the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (the "Department") attempted to contact the applicant to request that she provide further information in order to determine whether she met the criteria for the grant of a permanent spouse visa.
Some of this correspondence was sent to Global Interchange Australia Pty Ltd ("Global Interchange"), the agent appointed to act on behalf of the applicant.
On 13 March 2003, Global Interchange advised that it no longer acted for the applicant.
Other letters were sent to the applicant at her last-known residential address of 3 Willow Avenue, St Albans, Victoria, and at several other addresses.
On 30 May 2003, an attempt was made to contact the applicant by telephone.
A person purportedly answering the phone advised that he did not know anyone by her name.
7 On 6 November 2003, a delegate of the Minister refused to grant the applicant a permanent spouse visa.
The delegate noted that she had been given a reasonable opportunity to provide information and documentation confirming that the relationship was genuine and continuing.
However, in the absence of any such evidence, the delegate was "unable to make a positive conclusion in this respect", and found that the applicant therefore did not satisfy clause 801.221, a criterion for the grant of a permanent spouse visa.
8 On 24 May 2004, the applicant filed an application in the Federal Magistrates Court seeking judicial review of the delegate's decision.
It was that proceeding, MLG 587 of 2004, that was dismissed by McInnis FM on 24 January 2005.
9 On 16 February 2005, the applicant lodged an application in the Migration Review Tribunal (the "Tribunal") for review of the delegate's decision.
It appears that this was done in response to the Federal Magistrate's conclusion, in an earlier proceeding on the same day as the proceeding that is the subject of this application ( Tran v Minister for Immigration (No 1) [2005] FMCA 411) , that an adjournment should not be granted to enable the applicant to adduce evidence that she had applied, or attempted to apply, to the Tribunal for review of the delegate's decision.
On 24 February 2005, the Tribunal declined to accept or consider the application for review, on the basis that it was not lodged within the prescribed time limit.
10 On 18 March 2005, the applicant filed in this Court a Form 56A application under the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth), seeking orders "to quash the decision of the Federal Magistrates Court" (presumably the decision of McInnis FM on 24 January 2005 in Tran (No 2) ) and to remit the matter to the Tribunal for reconsideration according to law.
That proceeding, VID 206 of 2005, was transferred to the Federal Magistrates Court by Sundberg J on 19 April 2005.
11 On 15 September 2005, an amended application (in the proceeding transferred by Sundberg J to the Federal Magistrates Court) was filed on behalf of the applicant, by which review was sought of the Tribunal's decision to refuse to consider her application of 16 February 2005 for review, and the delegate's decision to refuse to grant a spouse visa.
The amended application no longer sought to quash the decision of McInnis FM, as the original application had done.
