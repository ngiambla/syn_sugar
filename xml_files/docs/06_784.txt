 1 In this proceeding, Peter Nikolich seeks compensation and/or damages against Goldman Sachs J B Were Services Pty Limited, his former employer.
The applicant's claims 
 
2 The claims made by the applicant varied from time to time.
Ultimately, three claims were pressed in submissions:
 
 
 (a) The respondent unlawfully terminated the applicant's employment by reason of:
 
 
 
 
 
 (A) his temporary absence from work because of illness, in breach of section 170CK(2)(a) of the Workplace Relations Act 1996 (Cth) ['the WR Act']; or
 
 (B) a mental disability in breach of section 170CK(2)(f) of the WR Act.

 
 
 
 
 (b) The respondent breached the applicant's contract of employment.
(c) The respondent engaged in misleading and deceptive conduct prior to the alteration of the terms and conditions of the applicant's contract of employment contrary to the provisions of sections 52 and/or 53B of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) ['the TP Act'] or s 42 of the Fair Trading Act 1987 (NSW) ['the FT Act'].

 

 The evidence 
 (i) Mr Nikolich joins the respondent 
 
3 Mr Nikolich was born on 7 August 1965.
He grew up in Wollongong.
After he left school, Mr Nikolich obtained employment with the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, ending up as a Business-Superannuation Consultant for the Australian Capital Territory and Southern New South Wales.
4 In May 2000, Mr Nikolich accepted an offer of employment in the Canberra office of Were Holdings Limited.
This company subsequently changed its name to Goldman Sachs JB Were Services Pty Limited.
It is the present respondent.
I will use the abbreviation 'GSJBWS' to refer to the company under either name.
5 When he accepted the offer of employment, Mr Nikolich was provided with several GSJBWS documents, including one called 'Working With Us' ('WWU').
This 119 page document sets out information about GSJBWS and contains a number of provisions which are argued by the applicant's counsel, Ms K Nomchong and Ms K Edwards, to constitute conditions of employment binding on both the relevant employee and GSJBWS.
It will be necessary for me, later on, to refer to some of these provisions.
6 At the request of a human resources officer of GSJBWS, Mr Nikolich signed and returned a copy of the letter containing his offer of employment.
The letter included at least some of the terms of his employment and contained an acknowledgment that will be referred to later.
Mr Nikolich was not asked to sign a copy of WWU.
7 Mr Nikolich commenced employment with GSJBWS on 15 May 2000.
He was then classified as an Associate Investment Adviser.
On 1 July 2001, he was upgraded to the position of Investment Adviser.
This position is also sometimes called a 'Private Client Adviser'.
In this role, he was required to provide investment advice to existing clients and to develop new client relationships.
8 Both as an Associate Investment Adviser and an Investment Adviser, Mr Nikolich reported to the manager of GSJBWS's Canberra branch.
Initially, this was Colin MacKenzie.
However, in March 2001, Roderick Sutherland, another Canberra Investment Adviser, was appointed also to be the Canberra branch manager and, therefore, Mr Nikolich's immediate supervisor.
9 As an Investment Adviser, Mr Nikolich received a base salary of $81,495 per annum.
He was entitled, in addition, to incentive payments calculated by reference to the nature and extent of the fees he earned for his employer.
Investment Advisers often received incentive payments that dwarfed their base salaries.
10 When he commenced with GSJBWS, Mr Nikolich was given a list of clients for whose business he was responsible.
Other names were given to him from time to time.
He himself added names.
Mr Nikolich said he actively cultivated all the clients on the list and sought to recruit others.
In the financial year 1 July 2001 to 30 June 2002, his total remuneration (base salary and incentive payments) was $161,178.
(ii) The partnership concept 
 
11 In December 2001, Mr Sutherland presented a paper to a meeting of the financial advisers in the Canberra office, of whom there were about ten.
The paper was entitled Establishment of a partnership approach to client management within the Canberra Office .
It seems the partnership concept had been brought to Australia from the United States.
Mr Sutherland announced that he and two other Canberra financial advisers, Stephen Johnston and Lee Scott, would 'trial a partnership approach to client management'.
He said 'all clients and revenues will be pooled under a newly formed "RSL" adviser code, with the remuneration structure reflecting each partner's level of experience and capacity to contribute to the future growth of the partnership'.
