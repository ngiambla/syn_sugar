The orders made on 3 February 2006 were as follows:
 

 
 
 "1.
The applicant prepare a bill of costs in respect of the motion, notice of which was filed on 4 August 2004, and such bill of costs be taxed by Registrar Bardsley at 10.15 am on 13 February 2006.

 4.
The motion, notice of which was filed on 4 August 2004, be otherwise dismissed.
" 
 

2 At the hearing of the motion on 15 June 2006, Mr Armitage directed his challenge to paragraphs [2] and [3] of these orders.
In support of his motion, Mr Armitage relied on his affidavit sworn on 16 May 2006 (which referred to his earlier affidavits, the affidavits of the third and fourth respondents and Ms Saldaneri).
After the hearing, he filed a further affidavit sworn on 20 June 2006, and written submissions, both of which were filed pursuant to orders made on 15 June 2006.
In opposition to the motion, the applicant relied on the affidavits of Anna Maria Krycer affirmed on 30 May 2006 and 9 June 2006, the affidavit of Ayten Demirovski affirmed on 30 May 2006, and on written submissions filed before and (pursuant to order) after the hearing.
RELEVANT BACKGROUND 
 
3 The orders of 3 February 2006 were made following the hearing, on various dates, of the applicant's motion for default judgment.
The applicant's motion was based on what she claimed was a substantial history of delay by the first and second respondents.
4 Mr Armitage sought to appeal against the 3 February 2006 orders by way of a notice of appeal filed on 24 February 2006.
His notice of appeal included the following ground of appeal (among others):
 
 "That the Appellant (Respondents) herein [sic] have been denied natural justice in that --- 
 
 
 (a) their legal representative was allowed to withdraw from the proceedings without them being given the opportunity to be heard 
 (b) they were not afforded an opportunity to be heard by the court following the withdrawal (without notice to them) of their legal representation.
" 
 

At a directions hearing on 22 March 2006 before Ryan J, the respondent to the appeal (the applicant in the substantive proceeding) noted that Mr Armitage required leave to appeal and an extension of time.
His Honour made orders adjourning the date for settling the index until the Court dealt with any application for leave to appeal and, subsequently, he adjourned Mr Armitage's application for an extension of time, indicating that he considered that it might be appropriate for Mr Armitage to make an application in this proceeding pursuant to O 35 r 7 of the Federal Court Rules 1979 ("the Rules").
Mr Armitage's motion was filed following this indication.
THE REASONS FOR THE ORDERS OF 3 FEBRUARY 2006 
 
5 On 3 February 2006, I delivered reasons for judgment concerning the applicant's motion for default judgment and made the orders that Mr Armitage now seeks to have set aside: see Wu v Avin Operations Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 36 (" Wu ").
6 In Wu , I considered (at [6]-[25]) the extensive history of delay and non-compliance with the Court's orders by the first and second respondents.
I found (at [52]-[53]) that the first and second respondents had failed to defend the proceeding with due diligence and were in default for the purposes of O 35A r 2(2)(h) of the Rules.
