 
1 This case is concerned with amendments to the Customs Act 1901 (Cth) (the " Customs Act ") and the Excise Act 1901 (Cth) (the " Excise Act "), extending the diesel fuel rebate scheme.
In introducing the relevant legislation into Parliament (Hansard, House of Representatives, Tuesday 22 June 1999 at 7049-50) the Minister for Transport and Regional Services said:
 
 'Under this bill and the customs bill, and the environment expenditure package agreed between the government and the Australian Democrats, there will be large and enduring benefits to regional Australia, to the environment and to transport operators in the road, rail and marine sectors.
Businesses across Australia will pay less for fuel than they do now because they will get back the GST paid on inputs, including fuel.
It is expected that business should save around 6 c to 7 c per litre by this measure alone, although the actual amount will not be until next year after the final pre-GST half-yearly CPI adjustment to excise rates.
' 
 

2 Diesel fuel is manufactured locally, but some is imported.
Locally manufactured fuel is subject to the Excise Act whilst imported fuel is subject to the Customs Act .
When an end user purchases such fuel, it is not identifiable as locally produced or imported.
The relevant legislation provides benefits to a person who buys fuel for a particular use.
It is therefore necessary that the rebate provisions in the Excise Act and the Customs Act be in similar terms.
Relevantly, s 164(1AA) of the Customs Act provides:
 
 'This section makes provision for a rebate to be payable in respect of diesel fuel purchased for certain usages.
In particular (but without limiting the effect of the provisions), it sets out: 
 
 
 
 (a) the particular usages of diesel fuel that would entitle a person to apply for rebate (subsection (1)); and 
 ... ' 
 
 

3 Subsection 164(1) provides:
 
 'A rebate is, subject to subsections (2) and (4A) and to such conditions and restrictions as are prescribed (being conditions and restrictions that relate to goods generally, to goods included in a class of goods that include diesel fuel or to diesel fuel only), payable to a person who purchases diesel fuel for use by the person: 
 
 
 
 (a) in mining operations (otherwise than for the purpose of propelling any vehicle on a public road); 
 
 (aa) in primary production (otherwise than for the purpose of propelling a road vehicle on a public road); 
 
 (ab) in rail transport (otherwise than for the purpose of propelling a road vehicle on a public road) in the course of carrying on an enterprise; 
 
 (ac) in marine transport (otherwise than for the purpose of propelling a road vehicle on a public road) in the course of carrying on an enterprise; 
 
 (ad) at particular premises to generate electricity for use in the course of carrying on, at those premises, an enterprise that: 
 
 
 
 
 
 (i) has, as its principal purpose, the retail sale of goods or services or the provision of hospitality; and 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (ii) does not have, at those premises, ready access to a commercial supply of electricity; 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (b) at residential premises to generate electricity for use in: 
 
 
 
 (i) providing food and drink for; 
 
 
 
 
 (ii) providing lighting, heating, air conditioning, hot water or similar amenities for; or 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (iii) meeting other domestic requirements of; 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 residents of the premises; 
 
 (c) at a hospital or nursing home or at any other institution providing medical or nursing care; or 
 
 
 
 
 
 (d) at a home for aged persons.
' 
 
 
 

4 For present purposes, the relevant paragraph is par 164(1)(ab).
Some of the terms used in that paragraph are defined in subs 164(7).
In particular, the following terms are of interest:
 
 ' carrying on an enterprise has the same meaning as in the Diesel and Alternative Fuels Grants Scheme Act 1999 .

 
 rail transport includes light rail transport and transport by tram, but does not include any rail transport relating to forestry.

 
 road vehicle means a vehicle of a kind ordinarily used on roads for the transport of persons or goods.
' 
 

5 Reference to the Diesel and Alternative Fuels Grants Scheme Act 1999 discloses that the expression 'carrying on an enterprise', 'includes doing anything in the course of the commencement or termination of the enterprise.
' That Act provides that the word 'enterprise', 'has the meaning given to it by section 38 of the " A New Tax System (Australian Business Number) Act 1999 " ' .
In s 38 of that Act, the word 'enterprise' is defined as follows (see s 38):
 
 
 'An enterprise is an activity or series of activities done, 
 (a) in the form of a business; or 
 
 
 (b) in the form of an adventure or concern in the nature of trade; or 
 (c) on a regular or continuous basis, in the form of a lease, licence or other grant of an interest in property ;or 
 ... ' 
 

6 Section 41 of the same Act provides that:
 
 'business includes any profession, trade, employment, vocation or calling, but does not include occupation as an employee.
' 
 

7 The relevant provision of the Excise Act is s 78A.
It is in similar terms to s 164 of the Customs Act .
Pursuant to subs 78A(7) and subs 78A(8), various terms have the same meanings as in the Customs Act .
8 This case concerns the entitlement of Queensland Rail to receive a rebate in connection with the purchase of diesel fuel for use in its operations.
Although there is no substantial dispute as to the extent of those operations, it will be of assistance in understanding the ambit of the matter if I briefly outline the evidence concerning them.
Queensland Rail has five "business groups" described as follows:
 
(a) the Passenger Services Group;
 
(b) the Coal and Freight Services Group, now known as "QR National";
 
(c) the Network Access Group;
 
(d) the Infrastructure Services Group; and
 
 (e) the Workshops Group, now known as the "Rollingstock and Component Services Group".


9 The Passenger Services Group operates commuter trains within the Brisbane region, long distance passenger trains and tourist trains.
There are 140 stations in that region and 72 stations elsewhere in Queensland.
In the Brisbane region, there are 300 kilometres of track which, in 2003-2004, carried 48.1 million passengers, with an average of 150 000 passenger journeys per day.
The Coal and Freight Services Group (now known as "QR National"), provides freight, transport and logistic solutions to a variety of customers throughout Australia.
It includes three divisions, Coal, Containerized Freight and Bulk Freight.
10 The Network Access Group has responsibility for managing Queensland Rail's infrastructure, including the rail network of more than 9 500 kilometres and all associated facilities and equipment 'necessary for carrying on the rail transport enterprise, including track, bridges, tunnels, level crossing, signalling, safety critical operation systems, the electric overhead traction system, train control centres, marshalling yards, communication systems, machinery and equipment.
' 
 
11 The Infrastructure Services Group is responsible for maintenance of Queensland Rail's rail transport infrastructure, including:
 
(a) track construction, including sleeper laying and track laying;
 
(b) project management and co-ordination;
 
(c) track materials logistics management;
 
(d) ballast cleaning and formation;
 
(e) track grinding and lubrication;
 
(f) track re-surfacing;
 
(g) track re-sleepering;
 
(h) on-track inspection services;
 
(i) rail maintenance; and
 
(j) trackside system and overhead maintenance.
12 The Workshops Group (now called the Rolling Stock and Component Services Group) provides maintenance, modification, overhaul, component exchange and manufacturing support for rolling stock.
Queensland Rail is a statutory corporation, operating pursuant to the requirements of the Transport Infrastructure Act 1994 (Qld) (the "TI Act").
The TI Act requires Queensland Rail to have a safety management system.
Queensland Rail claims that the provision of an adequate maintenance system is a necessary aspect of that system and also minimizes the cost associated with its operations.
I accept those claims.
13 There is no dispute concerning Queensland Rail's entitlement to rebate in connection with its use of diesel fuel in running trains.
The dispute is as to entitlement to such rebate in connection with the use of diesel fuel in other aspects of its operations.
There is a substantial body of evidence concerning various types of equipment used by Queensland Rail, particularly in maintenance activities and in the loading and unloading of freight.
Some equipment is mounted "on-rail", either because relevant functions require that arrangement or for mobility.
Other equipment is either stationary or moves "off-rail".
Some equipment is capable of use on and off-rail.
It is described as "hi-rail".
14 In Excise Bulletin EB 2000/3 , issued on 30 June 2000, the Australian Taxation Office offered a view as to the meaning of the expression "rail transport" as used in the Excise Act .
It said:
 
 'The expression "rail transport" includes light rail transport and transport by tram, but does not include any rail transport relating to forestry.

 
 The following uses of diesel fuel are eligible for rebate: 
 
 
 
 (a) in trains, trams or other vehicles operating on rail for the transport of goods or passengers, whether or not on scheduled services; 
 
 (b) in trains, trams or other vehicles operating on rail carrying out activities connected with rail transport (including the forward journey of a train with a view to undertaking transport activities or the return journey after the transport activities have been carried out); 
 
 (c) in trains, trams or other vehicles operating on rail to carry out: 
 
 (i) repair and maintenance of tracks; 
 (ii) observation of track conditions; 
 
 
 
 
 (iii) reduction of fire hazards on or adjacent to tracks; 
 (iv) rescue or recovery of derailed rolling stock; 
 (v) re-positioning of rail vehicles; or 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (d) in trains, trams or other vehicles operating on rail for their day-to-day operations (including air conditioning, heating or lighting).

 
 
 
 The following uses of diesel fuel are not eligible for rebate: 
 
 
 
 (a) the production or manufacture of goods (including rail vehicles); 
 
 
 
 
 
 (b) the movement, handling, storage, loading or unloading of goods before or after rail transportation; 
 
 
 
 
 
 (c) the transport of passengers before or after rail travel; 
 
 
 
 
 
 (d) planning, development or construction of railways, tramways, light rail networks, freight terminals, storage depots or similar facilities or infrastructure; 
 
 
 
 
 
 (e) the supply of goods or services (including fuels) to rail transport vehicles by means other than rail; or 
 
 
 
 
 
 (f) activities not conducted on railways, tramways or light rail systems.
' 
 
 
 

15 On 26 June 2003, PricewaterhouseCoopers, on behalf of Queensland Rail, wrote to the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation, seeking to amend a previous diesel rebate claim to include claims relating to use of diesel fuel in connection with:
 
 '1.
Plant used in carrying on the enterprise (see Attachment A); 
 
 2.
Road vehicles capable of travelling on rail (see Attachment B); 
 ... ' 
 

16 There was also a claim for diesel fuel stock on hand, but that claim is no longer relevant.
