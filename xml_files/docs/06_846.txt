 
 1 The applicant is a citizen of the Republic of China.
At the beginning of the 2003 academic year the applicant commenced a Bachelor of Commerce course of study at Curtin University ('Curtin').
The applicant was the holder of a student visa ('the visa') which was subject to Condition 8202.
On 29 March 2004 a delegate of the first respondent cancelled the applicant's visa on the grounds that the applicant had breached Condition 8202 of the visa because of an unsatisfactory academic performance.
The applicant now seeks judicial review of the decision of the Migration Review Tribunal ('the Tribunal'), which upheld the delegate's decision to cancel the applicant's visa.
2 The main issue which arises in this application is whether the Tribunal failed to deal with a significant element of the case made before it by the applicant, and thereby fell into jurisdictional error.
3 I join the Migration Review Tribunal as the second respondent.
Statutory framework 
 
4 Section 20 of the Education Services for Overseas Students Act 2000 (Cth) ('the ESOS Act') provides:
 
 'Sending students notice of visa breaches 
 
 
 (1) A registered provider must send an accepted student of the provider a written notice if the student has breached a student visa condition relating to attendance or satisfactory academic performance.

 
 
 
 (2) The registered provider must send the notice as soon as practicable after the breach.

 
 (3) The notice must be in a form approved by the Secretary of the Immigration Minister's Department.

 
 (4) The notice must: 
 
 
 
 a. contain particulars of the breach; and 
 
 b. state that the student is required to attend in person before an officer (within the meaning of the Migration Act 1958 ) at a specified place within 28 days after the day specified in the notice as the date of the notice, for the purpose of explaining the breach; and 
 
 c. state that the student must present photographic identification when so attending; and 
 
 d. set out the effect of sections 137J and 137K of that Act.



 Unincorporated registered providers 
 
 
 (5) If the registered provider is an unincorporated body, then it is instead the principal executive officer of the provider who must send the notice as required under this section.
' 
 
 

5 The general power to cancel visas is provided for in s 116 of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) ('the Act').
Of particular relevance is s 116(3) which states:
 
 'If the Minister may cancel a visa under subsection (1), the Minister must do so if there exist prescribed circumstances in which a visa must be cancelled.
' 
 

6 Regulation 2.43(2) of the Migration Regulations 1994 (Cth) ('the Regulations') prescribes the following circumstances in which the Minister must cancel the visa:
 
 'For subsection 116(3) of the Act, the circumstances in which the Minister must cancel a visa are: 
 
 
 (a) each of the circumstances comprising the grounds set out in paragraphs (1)(a) and (b); and 
 
 
 
 (b) in the case of a Student (Temporary) (Class TU) visa, that the Minister is satisfied that the visa holder has not complied with: 
 
 
 
 
 
 (i) condition 8104 or 8105 (if the condition applies to the visa); or 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (ii) condition 8202.
' 
 
 
 
 

7 Condition 8202 of Schedule 8 of the Regulations relevantly provides:
 
 '(1) The holder (other than the holder of a Subclass 560 (Student) visa who is an AusAID student or the holder of a Subclass 576 (AusAID or Defence Sector) visa) must meet the requirements of subclauses (2) and (3).

 
 
 (2) A holder meets the requirements of this subclause if: 
 
 (a) the holder is enrolled in a registered course; or 
 
 
 (b) in the case of the holder of a Subclass 560 or 571 (Schools Sector) visa who is a secondary exchange student -- the holder is enrolled in a full-time course of study or training.

 
 
 (3) A holder meets the requirements of this subclause if: 
 
 
 (a) in the case of a holder whose education provider keeps attendance records -- the Minister is satisfied that the holder attends for at least 80% of the contact hours scheduled: 
 
 
 
 (i) for a course that runs for less than a semester -- for the course; or 
 
 
 
 (ii) for a course that runs for at least a semester -- for each term and semester of the course; and 
 
 
 
 (b) in any case -- the holder achieves an academic result that is certified by the education provider to be at least satisfactory: 
 
 
 
 (i) for a course that runs for less than a semester -- for the course; or 
 
 
 
 (ii) for a course that runs for at least a semester -- for each term or semester (which ever is shorter) of the course.

 
 (4) In the case of the holder of a Subclass 560 visa who is an AusAID student or the holder of a Subclass 576 (AusAID or Defence Sector) visa -- the holder is enrolled in a full-time course of study or training.

 Factual background 
 
8 In the first semester of the 2003 academic year at Curtin the applicant failed two units and passed two units.
In the second semester the applicant passed one unit (being a unit he had failed in the first semester), failed another unit, Project Management 250, and did not complete the third unit, 'Development (Principles of Programming) 200'.
9 By a letter dated 11 December 2003, Curtin informed the applicant that his academic status was terminated and he was unable to continue in the course.
The letter said: 'Terminated status applies where student progress had not been satisfactory'.
The letter stated that the applicant had a right to appeal against the terminated status.
10 The applicant appealed Curtin's decision.
In a letter to the appeal department of Curtin dated 12 December 2003, the applicant explained his reasons for not completing the unit, Development (Principles of Programming) 200 and advised the appeal department of his intention to take the same unit as part of the forthcoming Curtin Business School Summer Program.
He also explained his reasons for performing poorly in the unit, Project Management 250.
11 By a letter dated 7 January 2004 Curtin advised the applicant that his appeal was unsuccessful and his academic status would remain as 'Terminated'.
The letter advised the applicant to take note of the following comments made by his Head of School:
 
 'The course weighted average is too low (ie.
44.57%) and there does not appear to be reasonable grounds to explain the poor performance in the units.
' 
 

12 There was no reference in the letter to the applicant's expressed intention to take the unit, Development (Principles of Programming) 200, as part of the summer program.
Notwithstanding its letter of 7 January 2004, Curtin permitted the applicant to enrol in the summer program and to take the unit, Development (Principles of Programming) 200 as part of that program.
The applicant completed the course and passed the unit.
13 By a letter dated 19 March 2004 Curtin sent the applicant a notice under s 20 of the ESOS Act ('the s 20 Notice').
The letter advised the applicant that he had breached a condition of his visa relating to satisfactory academic performance in the course in which he was enrolled.
The particulars of the breach were given as:
 
 'Terminated from course: unsatisfactory academic performance due to failures, including non completion'.

 

14 On 19 March 2004 Curtin also sent to the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs ('the department') a complete statement of the appellant's Academic Record dated 19 March 2004.
The statement read as follows:

15 On 23 March 2004, as a consequence of having received the s 20 Notice, the applicant reported to the department.
On that day, an officer of the department gave the applicant a notice of intention to consider cancellation of the applicant's visa.
That notice invited the applicant to provide comments at an interview with a delegate of the first respondent ('the delegate').
16 On 29 March 2004 the applicant attended an interview with a delegate.
Shortly thereafter, on the same day, the delegate cancelled the applicant's visa on the grounds of a breach of Condition 8202 of his visa.
In the reasons for decision the delegate wrote:
 
 'Provider advised DIMIA on 19/3/04 that student has been terminated from his course due to poor academic performance.
Student appealed and appeal was dismissed.
Breach of condition 8202 for failing to meet course requirements.
' 
 

 Proceedings before the Tribunal 
 
17 On 7 April 2004 the applicant lodged an application with the Tribunal for a review of the delegate's decision.
In a typed statement which supported the application the applicant said:
 
 '...
