The property was called 'Appletrees'.
In 1955, Appletrees was owned by Warwick's father.
Warwick's father died in 1955, leaving a widow and three young children, being Warwick and his siblings, Philip Wall and Helen Wall.
Mr Wall Snr left Appletrees to his widow, Mrs Irene Wall.
2 In 1961, in order to avoid death duty in respect of Appletrees on her death, Mrs Wall caused Appletrees Pastoral Company Pty Ltd ('the Company') to be formed.
The Company then purchased Appletrees from her.
Shares in the Company were vested in Warwick, Philip and Helen, as to one third each.
While the children remained infants, their respective shares were held on trust by their aunt and uncle.
When they ceased to be infants, their shares were registered in their own names.
3 In 1987, the Company sold Appletrees.
After discharging its liabilities, there was a surplus in the Company of some $2,200,000.
At that time, the Company had accrued losses of $1.6 million which, subject to certain prerequisites being satisfied, it was entitled to carry forward for tax purposes, such that the accrued losses could be set off against income derived in future years.
4 In 1988, a restructure of the Company was effected.
Various transactions were entered into, which resulted in payments being made to Mrs Wall's three children, Warwick, Philip and Helen.
Part of the payments to the three children was the subject of a gift by them to their mother, who then lent the money to the Company.
Warwick, Philip and Helen, however, continued to hold their shares in the Company.
Warwick's continued holding of shares in the Company gives rise to this proceeding.
The question is whether he continued to hold them beneficially, or whether he held them as trustee for his mother.
THE TRIBUNAL'S DECISIONS 
 
5 From 1994 until 2001, Warwick was in receipt of a disability support pension under the Social Security Act 1991 (Cth) ('the Entitlement Act').
In June 2001, the applicant, the Secretary of the Department of Family and Community Services ('the Secretary'), cancelled the pension from 28 August 2001.
The reason was that the value of Warwick's continued shareholding in the Company meant that the pension was not payable.
The Secretary also decided to take steps to recover from Warwick the amounts paid to him by way of disability support pension from 1994 to August 2001.
6 Warwick subsequently transferred his shares in the Company to his mother.
He then made a new claim for a disability support pension.
That claim was rejected by the Secretary because the shares in the Company were still regarded as property beneficially owned by Warwick.
