In that decision the learned Federal Magistrate dismissed the applicant's claim for relief against the second respondent for a breach of any provision of Pt II Div 3 of the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 (Cth) (' SD Act ').
2 As explained in the reasons for judgment of Jarrett FM, the substantive application filed by the applicant on 10 August 2004 sought orders from the Federal Magistrates Court under the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1986 (Cth) (' HREOC Act ') that the respondents apologise to the applicant and pay him financial compensation in respect of alleged unlawful discrimination and sexual harassment.
The application before me concerns only interlocutory relief obtained by the second respondent as a result of the orders made by Jarrett FM in his decision of 12 October 2005.
3 Limitations of time in respect of filing and serving notices of appeal of decisions of the Federal Court or the Federal Magistrates Court are found in O 52 r 15 Federal Court Rules .
The rule provides:
 
 '(1) The notice of appeal shall be filed and served - 
 
 (a) within 21 days after - 
 
 
 (i) the date when the judgment appealed from was pronounced; 
 (ii) the date when leave to appeal was granted; or 
 (iii) any later date fixed for that purpose by the court appealed from; or 
 
 
 (b) within such further time as is allowed by the Court or a Judge upon application made by motion upon notice filed within the period of 21 days referred to in the last preceding paragraph.

 
 (2) Notwithstanding anything in the preceding subrule, the Court or a Judge for special reasons may at any time give leave to file and serve a notice of appeal.
' 

4 In this case on 14 February 2006 the applicant filed a notice of appeal in addition to the application for leave to file and serve out of time.
This was more than four months after the judgment of Jarrett FM was delivered.
The applicant did not apply to the Court within 21 days of the judgment of Jarrett FM for an extension of time as permitted by O 52 r 15(2)(b).
It follows that the applicant is required to seek the leave of this Court pursuant to O 52 r 15(2) to file and serve a notice of appeal.
5 However, a complication which has not been addressed by the parties in this case is that the decision of Jarrett FM pursuant to r 13.10 Federal Magistrates Court Rules 2001 ('FMCR') was an interlocutory judgment.
His Honour noted himself in his reasons for decision that the application brought by the second respondent was interlocutory (par 3).
Further, as pointed out by the High Court of Australia in In the matter of an appeal by Gaye Alexandra Mary Luck [2003] HCA 70 at [6] :
 
 'For more than a century, courts, including courts of the highest authority, have consistently held that an order staying an action on the ground that it is frivolous, vexatious or an abuse of process is an interlocutory order.
' 

6 This principle represents the position in Australia: Luck at [8].
That decisions of Federal Magistrates pursuant to r 13.10 FMCR are interlocutory judgments is also beyond doubt, as pointed out by Lander J in Rana v University of South Australia [2004] FCA 559 at [6] - [15] .
7 Appeals from interlocutory judgments of the Federal Magistrates Court are not as of right.
Leave of a Judge or the Court is required: s 24(1A) Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth).
In the case before me however, the applicant has not sought leave to appeal from the decision of Jarrett FM.
8 I shall return to the issue of leave to appeal later in this judgment.
BACKGROUND 
 
9 The judgment of Jarrett FM arose from an application filed on 1 November 2004 by the second respondent pursuant to r 13.10 FMCR.
In that application the second respondent sought an order that the proceedings commenced against it by the applicant be summarily dismissed, or alternatively stayed.
10 The claim of the applicant against the second respondent was described by Jarrett FM as (par 6):
 
 1. the second respondent had discriminated against the applicant, in breach of the SD Act , by reason of the way in which it dealt with certain complaints of sexual harassment made by him against the first respondent and the first respondent against him; 2. the second respondent was vicariously liable for certain alleged breaches of the SD Act by the first respondent; and 3. the second respondent failed in its duty toward him to properly train him in dealing with complaints of sexual harassment.


11 The facts forming the basis of the substantive application were set out in detail in the reasons for the decision of Jarrett FM.
For the purposes of the application before him, Jarrett FM accepted all that the applicant alleged as matters of fact, including material appended to affidavits filed by the applicant (par 12).
