 INTRODUCTION 
 
3 The plaintiffs ("the Scheme Companies") apply for orders pursuant to s 411(1) of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) ("the Corporations Act ") that meetings of their respective creditors be convened for the purpose of considering and, if thought fit, approving schemes of arrangement between them and those creditors.
They also seek an order approving the form of the Explanatory Statement for the schemes, and providing for the manner in which the meetings are to be held.
4 The Scheme Companies are insurance companies.
Their businesses are in the nature of reinsurance and are in run-off.
In broad terms, the purpose of each scheme is to accelerate the payment of reinsurance claims that have been made, or might be in the future, so as to resolve their potential reinsurance now, and to enable their businesses to be terminated.
"CUT-OFF" OR "VALUATION" SCHEMES GENERALLY 
 
5 Schemes such as the present ones are referred to as "cut-off" or "valuation" schemes.
While there have been several in England in recent years, this appears to be only the second in Australia, the first being the subject of Conti J's judgment in Re Mercantile Mutual Insurance (Australia) Ltd (" MMIA ") (2002) 196 ALR 362.
