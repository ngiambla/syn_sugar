 
 1 These two proceedings concern the recovery of payments made by Trader Systems International Pty Ltd ('TSI') and TSI Australia Limited ('TSIA') to the Commissioner of Taxation ('the Commissioner').
The proceedings were heard together with the consent of the parties.
2 TSI and TSIA are related companies.
The directors of TSI at all relevant times were Anthony James Scott ('Scott') and Andrew Ian Fairbank ('Fairbank').
At all relevant times, the directors of TSIA were Scott, Fairbank and Mark Merwan Bayoud ('Bayoud').
In each proceeding, the Commissioner of Taxation ('the Commissioner') has joined the relevant directors as third parties and made a claim against them pursuant to s 588FGA of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) ('the Act').
Scott and Fairbank appeared and defended these claims in each proceeding.
In the proceeding relating to TSIA, the Commissioner did not serve its cross claim on Bayoud, and no orders are sought against him.
3 On 15 May 2003, the plaintiff and Karen Maree Mathers ('Mathers') were appointed as administrators of each company pursuant to s 436A of the Act.
On 23 July 2003, the plaintiff and Mathers were appointed as liquidators of each company pursuant to s 439C.
On 14 October 2004, Mathers resigned as liquidator of each company.
4 In the first proceeding (VID 8 of 2005), the plaintiff in his capacity as liquidator of TSI claims that payments totalling $38,319.55 made by TSI to the Commissioner were unfair preferences pursuant to s 588FA and are void against the plaintiff pursuant to s 588FE of the Act.
The relevant payments were: 
 
 Date Amount 
 27 November 2002 $1,000.00
 4 December 2002 $903.82
 5 December 2002 $7,779.15
 11 December 2002 $3,923.00
 10 January 2003 $14,516.14
 13 January 2003 $1,025.00
 20 January 2003 $781.70
 21 February 2003 $1,125.67
 24 March 2003 $913.00
 24 April 2003 $5,700.00
 28 April 2003 $652.07
 

With the exception of the payment of $5,700.00 on 24 April 2003, all of these payments were garnishee payments.
The payment of $5,700.00 was made by TSI by cheque.

 5 Pursuant to s 588FF of the Act, the plaintiff seeks an order that the Commissioner pay to the plaintiff the sum of $38,319.55, together with a further agreed sum of $16,865.33 on account of interest and costs.
6 In the second proceeding (VID 9 of 2005), the plaintiff in his capacity as liquidator of TSIA alleges that the following payments, totalling $66,827.05, made by TSIA to the Commissioner were unfair preferences pursuant to s 588FA and are void against the plaintiff pursuant to s 588FE of the Act: 
 
 Date Amount 
 12 December 2002 $20,000.00
 2 January 2003 $4,114.00
 15 January 2003 $20,000.00
 5 March 2003 $3,540.00
 14 March 2003 $16,813.05
 21 March 2003 $2,360.00 
 
 

The payments were made by TSIA by cheques drawn on its bank account.

 7 In addition, the plaintiff alleges that the payments, totalling $92,988.07, were made by TSIA to the Commissioner in respect of TSI's tax liabilities.
The plaintiff contends that these payments were uncommercial transactions pursuant to s 588FB of the Act and are void against the plaintiff pursuant to s 588FE of the Act.
The relevant payments were: 
 
 Date Amount 
 30 November 2002 $47,999.04
 30 December 2002 $37,394.03
 2 January 2003 $7,595.00
 

These payments were made by TSIA by cheques drawn on its bank account.

 8 Pursuant to s 588FF of the Act, the plaintiff seeks an order that the Commissioner pay to the plaintiff the sum of $159,815.12, with no order as to interest or costs.

 THE STATUTORY SCHEME 
 
 9 Section 588FF(1) relevantly provides: 
 
 
 '(1) Where, on the application of a company's liquidator, a court is satisfied that a transaction of the company is voidable because of section 588FE , the court may make one or more of the following orders: 
 
 
 (a) an order directing a person to pay to the company an amount equal to some or all of the money that the company has paid under the transaction; 
 (b) ... 
 (c) an order requiring a person to pay to the company an amount that, in the court's opinion, fairly represents some or all of the benefits that the person has received because of the transaction'.

 
 
 10 Section 588FE(2) provides that a transaction is voidable if it is an insolvent transaction of the company and it was entered into during the six months ending on the relation back day.
In addition, s 588FE(3) provides that a transaction of the company is voidable if it is both an insolvent transaction, and an uncommercial transaction, that was entered into during the two years ending on the relation back day.
11 For both TSI and TSIA, the relation back day is 15 May 2003, being the day on which the administration of each company began: see ss 9 , 513B and 513C .
The relevant relation back period for unfair preferences is the six month period from 15 November 2002 to 15 May 2003.
The longer relation back period for uncommercial transactions is of no significance in the present case as all of the relevant payments were made within the six month period between 15 November 2002 and 15 May 2003.
12 Section 588FE needs to be read in conjunction with the provisions that define the concepts of an insolvent transaction, an unfair preference and an uncommercial transaction.
13 Section 588FC provides:
 'A transaction of a company is an insolvent transaction of the company if, and only if, it is an unfair preference given by the company, or an uncommercial transaction of the company, and: 
 
 (a) any of the following happens at a time when the company is insolvent: 
 (i) the transaction is entered into; or 
 (ii) an act is done, or an omission is made, for the purpose of giving effect to the transaction; or 
 
 (b) the company becomes insolvent because of, or because of matters including: 
 (i) entering into the transaction; or 
 (ii) a person doing an act, or making an omission, for the purpose of giving effect to the transaction.
' 


 
 14 Section 588FA(1) provides:
 'A transaction is an unfair preference given by a company to a creditor of the company if, and only if: 
 
 (a) the company and the creditor are parties to the transaction (even if someone else is also a party); and 
 (b) the transaction results in the creditor receiving from the company, in respect of an unsecured debt that the company owes to the creditor, more than the creditor would receive from the company in respect of the debt if the transaction were set aside and the creditor were to prove for the debt in a winding up of the company; 
 
 even if the transaction is entered into, is given effect to, or is required to be given effect to, because of an order of an Australian court or a direction by an agency.
' 
 
 15 Section 588FB(1) provides:
 'A transaction of a company is an uncommercial transaction of the company if, and only if, it may be expected that a reasonable person in the company's circumstances would not have entered into the transaction, having regard to: 
 
 (a) the benefits (if any) to the company of entering into the transaction; and 
 (b) the detriment to the company of entering into the transaction; and 
 (c) the respective benefits to other parties to the transaction of entering into it; and 
 (d) any other relevant matter.
' 
 
 
 16 The Commissioner's third party claim against the directors in each proceeding is brought pursuant to s 588FGA.
The precondition to the making of an indemnification order against directors is that the Court must make an order under s 588FF against the Commissioner because of the payment of an amount in respect of tax liabilities arising under specified provisions of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (Cth) or the Taxation Administration Act 1953 (Cth).
Stated more simply, the effect of s 588FGA(1) is that the right of indemnity against the directors does not arise in respect of any payment to the Commissioner that is avoided by the Court under s 588FF(1).
It only applies where the avoided payments relate to the particular tax liabilities specified in s 588FGA(1), which are commonly referred to as income tax withholding liabilities ('ITW liabilities').
17 Where the Court makes an order of the kind referred to in s 588FGA(1) against the Commissioner, s 588FGA(2) provides that each person who was a director of the company when the payment is made is liable to indemnify the Commissioner in respect of any loss or damage resulting from the order.
Section 588FGA(4) specifically provides that the Court may, in the same proceedings as those in which an order is made against the Commissioner, order a director to pay to the Commissioner an amount that is payable by that director pursuant to s 588FGA(2).
Section 588FGB(3) provides that it is a defence for a director against whom indemnity is claimed by the Commissioner if it is proved that, at the payment time, the director had reasonable grounds to expect, and did expect, that the company was solvent at that time and would remain solvent even if it made the payment.

 SETTLEMENT AS BETWEEN THE PLAINTIFF AND THE COMMISSIONER 
 
 18 At the commencement of the hearing on 26 April 2006, I was informed that the liquidator and the Commissioner had settled the claims in each proceeding as between themselves and had agreed upon orders that should be made to resolve each principal proceeding.
In arriving at this settlement, the plaintiff and the Commissioner narrowed the number of payments in contest to those which I have set out above.
The settlement did not extend to the claims brought by the Commissioner against the directors.
19 The agreement between the plaintiff and the Commissioner in each proceeding obviously has a direct impact upon the third parties.
The Commissioner's third party claim only becomes available to the Commissioner if the Court makes an order against the Commissioner pursuant to s 588FF, and then only to the extent that the order relates to payments made in respect of ITW liabilities of the kind specified in s 588FGA(1).
20 In the first proceeding, of the payments totalling $38,319.55 which are now claimed by the liquidator, the payments which related to ITW liabilities total $29,260.82.
The amount is calculated as follows: 
 Payment date Amount of payment ITW Period Amount of ITW paid 27 November 2002 $1,000.00 June 2001 $1,000.00 4 December 2002 $903.82 August 2001 $903.82 5 December 2002 $7,779.15 August 2001 $7,779.15 11 December 2002 $3,923.00 August 2001 $1,200.07 10 January 2003 $14,516.14 September 2001 $4,325.42 10 January 2003 
 October 2001 $9,024.08 13 January 2003 $1,025.00 October 2001 $533.92 13 January 2003 
 November 2001 $85.06 20 January 2003 $781.70 November 2001 $781.70 21 February 2003 $1,125.67 N/A Nil 24 March 2003 $913.00 N/A Nil 24 April 2003 $5,700.00 December 2001 $2,975.53 28 April 2003 $652.07 December 2001 $652.07 Total $38,319.55 Total $29,260.82 
 
 21 In the second proceeding concerning TSIA, of the payments totalling $159,815.12 which are now claimed by the liquidator, the payments which were made in respect of ITW liabilities total $107,329.99.
The amount is calculated as follows: 
 Payment date Amount ITW Period Amount of ITW paid 30 November 2002 $47,999.04 (uncommercial transaction) June 2001 $10,671.78 (TSI) 30 November 2002 July 2001 $17,851.00 (TSI) 30 November 2002 August 2001 $13,394.96 (TSI) 12 December 2002 $20,000.00 June 2001 $60.25 12 December 2002 July 2001 $6,980.00 12 December 2002 August 2001 $9,748.00 12 December 2002 September 2001 $2,443.75 30 December 2002 $37,394.03 (uncommercial transaction) September 2001 $8,574.58 (TSI) 2 January 2003 $4,114.00 November 2002 $4,114.00 2 January 2003 $7,595.00 (uncommercial transaction) November 2001 $7,595.00 (TSI) 15 January 2003 $20,000.00
 October 2001 $4,524.67 15 January 2003 November 2001 $6,200.00 15 January 2003 January 2002 $6,644.08 5 March 2003 $3,540.00 January 2003 $3,540.00 14 March 2003 $16,813.05 July 2002 $2,627.92 21 March 2003 $2,360.00 February 2003 $2,360.00 Totals $159,815.12 
 $107,329.99 
 
 22 The Court can only make an order under s 588FF(1) if it is 'satisfied' that the relevant payment transactions are voidable under s 588FE.
This means, inter alia, that the relevant transactions must be proven to be insolvent transactions and unfair preferences and/or uncommercial transactions.
In this case, Scott and Fairbank wish to contest the claims that the relevant payments were transactions within the meaning of s 9 , that they were unfair preferences or uncommercial transactions (as the case may be) within the meaning of ss 588FA and 588FB, and that the company was insolvent at the time when the relevant payments were made.
Generally speaking, the right to contest issues that only arise in the principal proceeding are an accepted incident of third party status: see Helicopter Sales (Australia) Pty Ltd v Rotor Work Pty Ltd [1974] HCA 32 ; (1974) 132 CLR 1 per Barwick CJ at 5 and Mason J at 15.
23 The authorities recognise that directors in the position of Scott and Fairbank should be able to contest the liquidator's claims against the Commissioner: see Crosbie v Commissioner of Taxation [2003] FCA 922 ; (2003) 130 FCR 275 at [4] - [7] (' Crosbie' ); Hall v Commissioner of Taxation [2004] NSWSC 985 ; (2004) 186 FLR 111 at [16] and [21]-[23] (' Hall' ), and Dean-Willcocks v Commissioner of Taxation (No 2) (2004) 49 ACSR 325.
In Crosbie , Finkelstein J made an order that the directors have leave to defend the liquidator's claim against the Commissioner of Taxation on terms that they be bound by all decisions made in that action and they be treated as if parties to the action on any issue relating to costs.
In Hall , Barrett J directed that the third parties have leave to appear and take part in the hearing of the plaintiffs' claims and to defend those claims: at [25].
24 When these issues were raised, I made orders in each proceeding in the same form as those made by Finkelstein J in Crosbie .
Specifically, I ordered that the third parties have leave to defend the plaintiff's claim against the Commissioner on terms that: (a) they each be bound by all decisions made in those actions; and (b) they each be treated as if parties to the action on any issue relating to costs.
This order was not opposed by either the plaintiff or the Commissioner.
25 In Crosbie , Finkelstein J also expressed the view, which was not necessary to his decision, that the Court should not act on the parties' admissions as to insolvency without satisfying itself on the evidence as to the correctness of that admission.
In his Honour's view, this conclusion followed from the fact that the Court can only make an order under s 588FF if it is satisfied that a transaction of a company is voidable under s 588FE.
Subsequent cases have rejected this view, and held that the Court can reach the requisite satisfaction on the basis of the parties' agreement: see Wanted World Wide (Australia) Limited v Commissioner of Taxation [2004] FCA 1063 ; (2004) 139 FCR 205 (' Wanted World Wide ') and Young v Commissioner of Taxation (2006) 56 ACSR 654 (' Young' ).
As I see it, no practical significance attaches to the issue in this case, notwithstanding the settlement reached between the plaintiff and the Commissioner, because the claims made by the plaintiff as to solvency and other matters were contested by Scott and Fairbank.
However, if and to the extent that the issue has any significance for this case, I prefer, and would apply, the views expressed in Wanted World Wide and Young .

 THE TSI GROUP 
 
 26 TSI and TSIA were part of a group of companies engaged in the development and marketing of an interpretative analytic software program known as 'The Trader System TM ' which was designed for use by retail options traders.
Companies within the group were linked in various ways, including cross shareholdings, common directorships, and/or licence agreements.
27 TSI and TSIA were subsidiaries of Trader Systems International Inc ('TSI Inc').
The intellectual property in 'The Trader System' was apparently owned by Wire Securities Limited (a New Zealand incorporated company) which entered into a licence agreement with TSI Inc giving TSI Inc the exclusive right to use and commercially exploit The Trader System software and trademarks.
TSI Inc granted TSI a licence allowing it to set up a website to operate The Trader System.
TSI Inc also granted TSIA a licence authorising it to exploit and develop the software and to use the trademarks by, inter alia, selling and marketing the Trader System and daily data supplied to it by TSI.
Under a service agreement between TSI and TSIA, TSIA was authorised to market the software and daily data supplied by TSI, in return for a service fee payable by TSI to TSIA.
28 Swift Securities and Investments Limited ('Swift Malaysia'), a company incorporated and resident in Malaysia, and Swift Securities and Investments Pty Ltd ('Swift Australia') were also part of the group.
Scott and Bayoud were directors of Swift Malaysia and Swift Australia.
From time to time, Swift Malaysia and Swift Australia advanced funds to TSI and TSIA to support their operations.
Swift Australia had the same registered office as TSI.

 THE DEFENCES RAISED BY SCOTT AND FAIRBANK 
 
 29 It is helpful to describe, in general terms, the defences raised by Scott and Fairbank.
30 In each proceeding, Scott and Fairbank disputed the plaintiff's case that orders should be made against the Commissioner pursuant to s 588FF on essentially two grounds.
First, and most substantially, they contended that neither TSI nor TSIA was insolvent at the time the relevant payments were made.
They argued that both TSI and TSIA relied on, and could reasonably rely on, funds provided by Swift Malaysia to pay their respective debts as and when they fell due.
They said that as soon as Bayoud told Scott on 13 May 2003 that Swift Malaysia would not provide further financial support to TSI and TSIA, they appointed administrators to both companies.
Secondly, they contended that the payments made by TSI and TSIA to the Commissioner did not constitute unfair preferences within the meaning of s 588FA, as they were not transactions between the relevant company (ie TSI or TSIA as the case may be) and its creditor within the meaning of s 9 and s 588FA.
Rather, they contended that the payments were made by Swift Malaysia or by the employees of TSI or TSIA (as the case may be) from whose wages tax payments were deducted, and not by TSI or TSIA.
31 Aside from these defences to the principal claim, Scott and Fairbank mounted independent defences to the third party claims brought by the Commissioner pursuant to s 588FGA.
First, they argued that, even if the Court made an order in the principal proceeding pursuant to s 588FF(1) in the terms sought by the liquidator, this would not establish that the Commissioner had suffered 'loss or damage' within the meaning of s 588FGA(2).
In substance, they argued that the effect of any such order would simply be to require the Commissioner to repay amounts to which he was not entitled.
In addition, Scott and Fairbank contended that neither interest nor costs paid by the Commissioner to the liquidator would constitute loss or damage resulting from an order made under s 588FF.
32 Lastly, Scott and Fairbank contended that they had a good defence to the Commissioner's claims under s 588FGB(3).
In their submission, the evidence proved that, at the time of each payment, they each had reasonable grounds to expect, and did expect, that TSI and TSIA were solvent and would remain solvent.

 SOLVENCY --- LEGAL PRINCIPLES 
 
 33 Section 95A of the Act provides: 
 
 '(1) A person is solvent if, and only if, the person is able to pay all the person's debts, as and when they become due and payable.

 
 (2) A person who is not solvent is insolvent.
' 
 
 
 34 As Sundberg J said recently in Tru Floor Service Pty Ltd v Jenkins (No 2) [2006] FCA 632 at [43] ( 'Tru Floor' ), s 95A mandates a cash flow rather than a balance sheet approach to determining solvency.
35 The relevant principles were distilled by Palmer J in Southern Cross Interiors Pty Ltd v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation [2001] NSWSC 621 ; (2001) 53 NSWLR 213 at 224-225 ( 'Southern Cross Interiors' ):
 'In my opinion, the following propositions may now be drawn from the authorities: 
 
 (i) whether or not a company is insolvent for the purposes of the Corporations Act (Cth), ss 95A , 459B , 588FC or 588G (1)(b), is a question of fact to be ascertained from a consideration of the company's financial position taken as a whole: Sandell v Porter, Pegulan Floor Coverings Pty Ltd v Carter (1997) 24 ACSR 651; 15 ACLC 1,293 and Fryer v Powell ; 
 
 (ii) in considering the company's financial position as a whole, the Court must have regard to commercial realities.
