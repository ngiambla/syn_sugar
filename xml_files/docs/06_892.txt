 
1 The appellant, Mr Maher, has appealed from a judgment of Federal Magistrate McInnis in which his Honour ordered that Mr Maher pay costs in the sum of $2,000.
2 The substantive proceeding before the Federal Magistrate was an application by Mr Maher to set aside a bankruptcy notice.
His Honour, by consent, made an order on 28 July 2005 to set aside the bankruptcy notice the subject of the proceeding.
3 His Honour then dealt with an application by the respondents for what he described as "an order for costs arising out of a number of adjournments".
The respondents succeeded in part in seeking their costs of those adjournments.
Mr Maher contends that his Honour erred in making a costs order in favour of the respondents.
The issue for determination in this appeal is whether the Court below erred in the exercise of its discretion to award costs to the respondents in respect of two occasions on which the proceeding was adjourned.
