 
1 On 29 May last I made orders convening a meeting of the members of SFE Corporation Limited pursuant to s 411(1) of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth).
The evidence satisfies me that that meeting was duly convened taking into account the signed certificates which have been provided and the undertaking which has been proffered.
The result of the meeting was a resounding yes to the proposed transaction.
No person has given notice of appearance to oppose.
The matter was called today and nobody has appeared to oppose.
2 As I indicated when I made orders convening the meeting, I had scrutinised (without the benefit of a contradictor) the arrangement to ensure, so far as I could detect, that there was nothing on the face of it which might lead to a refusal of approval if the meeting assented to the transaction.
I saw no such barrier and none has been pointed out to me since.
3 I drew attention on that occasion to a question which arises as to the means of enforcing arrangements such as these, including (although not restricted to) issues about solvency.
I am satisfied by the evidence that there is both the capacity to meet the obligations which are being undertaken and willingness on the part of those involved to do so.
Indeed, there is every reason for them to do so.
4 Under those circumstances there is no barrier to making an order approving the scheme.
I make orders in accordance with the draft minutes of order which I have initialled and placed with the papers.
I certify that the preceding four (4) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Gyles.
