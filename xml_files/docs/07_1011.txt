 INTRODUCTION 
 
1 The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) alleges that the first respondent (Mr Knight) and the second respondent (Mr Ross) have each contravened ss 45(2)(a)(ii) and 45 (2)(b)(ii), and each attempted to reach an agreement in contravention of s 45(2)(a)(ii), of the Competition Code of South Australia (the Code) as defined in s 4 of the Competition Policy Reform (South Australia) Act 1996 (SA).
It adopts Pt IV and other related sections of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) (the TPA).
2 The allegations of those contraventions are admitted, as set out in the Defence filed by Messrs Knight and Ross.
The ACCC does not press the balance of the allegations of contraventions in the Statement of Claim.
3 Based upon the admissions made by Messrs Knight and Ross, agreement has been reached as to the declaratory relief and other orders, including as to the levels of pecuniary penalties pursuant to s 76 of the Code, to be recommended to the Court as appropriate in relation to the admitted contraventions of the Code.
The parties have jointly made submissions as to the appropriate orders the Court should make, based upon the admitted conduct and the relevant background to the contraventions, and upon other matters which the parties contend to be relevant to Court's task.
4 I have been greatly assisted by the joint submissions, much of which is replicated in these reasons.
5 Litigation to establish contraventions such as those admitted by Messrs Knight and Ross can be very complex, time consuming and costly.
It is in the public interest for litigation to be concluded in the shortest time frame that is consistent with justice being done between the parties, freeing the ACCC to deal with other matters and reducing the public cost of a lengthy hearing in the Court.
Consequently, the Court has encouraged negotiated resolution of proceedings by the ACCC, provided that their terms recognise that the ultimate responsibility for determining the existence of a contravention or contraventions, and as to the proper orders to resolve the proceedings lies with the Court (see Trade Practices Commission v TNT Australia Pty Ltd (1995) ATPR 41-375; NW Frozen Foods Pty Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (1996) 71 FCR 285).
6 Accordingly, if the Court is satisfied that there has been a contravention or contraventions as alleged and that the terms of the proposed consent orders are appropriate, it is generally in the public interest for the Court to make orders in terms that have been agreed between parties so as to encourage parties to assist the ACCC in its investigations and to achieve negotiated settlements.
7 The principles governing whether a Court should accept a penalty that has been agreed between the ACCC and a respondent were considered in Trade Practices Commission v Allied Mills Industries Pty Ltd (No 4) (1981) 37 ALR 256 by Sheppard J, who stated at 259:
 
 It is, of course, true that the penalty has been suggested to me by the agreement of the parties.
Uninformed of their agreement, I may have selected a different figure, but I am satisfied that it would not have been very different from theirs.
There is from time to time, amongst members of the profession and amongst the public, discussion concerning plea bargaining.
Sometimes it is suggested that it involves disreputable conduct.
It is my opinion that that is so if it at all implicates the court in private discussions as to what the court's attitude will or would be likely to be if a particular course is taken.
In this case nothing of that kind has occurred.
The parties have made their own agreement and put it to the court for approval, not knowing what its attitude was likely to be.
...
This, of course, is not a criminal case; the liability is civil only.
But, even in the most serious criminal cases, it is not unusual for the prosecution to accept a plea to a lesser charge, subject always to the approval of the court.
I have said what I have only to explain that the course which the parties have adopted is both proper and not uncommon, even though perhaps novel in the comparatively new field of trade practices.


8 That approach was considered and approved by the Full Federal Court in NW Frozen Foods 71 FCR 285.
In that case, the Court held at 298 --- 299: 
 
 We agree with the statement made in several of the cases cited that it is not actually useful to investigate whether, unaided by the agreement of the parties, we would have arrived at the very figure they propose.
The question is not that; it is simply whether, in the performance of the Court's duty under section 76 , this particular penalty, proposed with the consent of the corporation involved and of the Commission, is one that the Court should determine to be appropriate.


9 The Full Court further stated at 291:
 
 There is an important public policy involved.
When corporations acknowledge contraventions, very lengthy and complex litigation is frequently avoided, freeing the courts to deal with other matters, and investigating officers of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to turn to other areas of the economy that await their attention.
At the same time, a negotiated resolution in the instant case may be expected to include measures designed to promote, for the future, vigorous competition in the particular market concerned.
These beneficial consequences would be jeopardised if corporations were to conclude that proper settlements were clouded by unpredictable risks.
A proper figure is one within the permissible range in all the circumstances.
The Court will not depart from an agreed figure merely because it might otherwise have been disposed to select some other figure, or except in a clear case.


10 The Full Court noted (at 290) that generally the most significant and relevant matters that the Court needed to consider about penalty were effects upon the functioning of markets and other economic effects.
Although the Court is responsible for determining the appropriate penalty, the Full Court considered that it would be informed by the views of the ACCC about those effects.
11 The decision of the Full Court in NW Frozen Foods 71 FCR 285 was followed by a later Full Court in Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources v Mobil Oil Australia Pty Ltd (2004) ATPR 41-993.
In that case, the Full Court at 48,626 also said that it considered that the following proposition emerged from NW Frozen Foods 71 FCR 285:
 
 ...the views of the regulator on matters within its expertise (such as the ACCC's views as to the deterrent effect of a proposed penalty in a given market) will usually be given greater weight than its views on more 'subjective' matters.


12 Further, in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Real Estate Institute of Western Australia Inc (1999) 161 ALR 79 at 86, at [18], French J said:
 
 The question whether an undertaking is to be accepted or a consent order made is not concluded by a finding that it is within the power of the court to do so.
The power of the court to make the orders sought is "defined and conferred by public law not by private agreement": Fiss, "Against Settlement" (1984) 93 Yale Law Journal 1073.
In the exercise of that power the court is not merely giving effect to the wishes of the parties, it is exercising a public function and must have regard to the public interest in doing so.
This principle applies to the resolution of private litigation by consent orders or undertakings.
A fortiori it applies to proceedings brought by the Crown or public or statutory authorities to enforce the law in the public interest.
The court has a responsibility to be satisfied that what is proposed is not contrary to the public interest and is at least consistent with it ... Consideration of the public interest, however, must also weigh the desirability of non-litigious resolution of enforcement proceedings .
(emphasis added).


13 There have been many other decisions of the Court applying those general principles.
14 As I indicated at the close of submissions, I am satisfied that each of the declarations proposed is appropriate and is within power.
I am also satisfied that the amount of the proposed pecuniary penalties in each instance and the further proposed order for each of Mr Knight and Mr Ross to attend a trade practices compliance program is appropriate and within power.
15 The following explains why I have reached those conclusions.
THE BACKGROUND FACTS 
 (a) The respondents 
 
16 Mr Knight is and was at all material times, a cardiothoracic surgeon practising in the Adelaide metropolitan area in South Australia who offered predominantly, and almost exclusively, cardiac surgical services at the Flinders Medical Centre (the FMC), Ashford Hospital (Ashford) and Flinders Private Hospital (Flinders Private).
He also is and was at all material times the head of the cardiac unit at the FMC, an Associate Professor of Surgery at Flinders University and was, from about November 2000 to about March 2003, a member of the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons' (RACS) Board of Cardiothoracic Surgery.
From 2002 to 2004, Mr Knight was Vice-President of the Australasian Society of Cardiac and Thoracic Surgeons and from 2004 to 2005 was its President.
17 Mr Ross is and was at all material times, a cardiothoracic surgeon also practising in the Adelaide metropolitan area in South Australia who offered predominantly, and almost exclusively, cardiac surgical services at the FMC, Ashford and Flinders Private.
Mr Ross was also at all material times a senior cardiac surgeon at the FMC and was, from June 2000, Clinical Advisor, Cardiothoracic Surgery at Adelaide Community Healthcare Alliance Inc (ACHA), which at all material times owned Ashford and Flinders Private.
Mr Ross was also President of the Australasian Society of Cardiac and Thoracic Surgeons between 1999 and 2000.
18 The conduct by Messrs Knight and Ross involving the contravention of the Code related to Mr Craig Jurisevic (Mr Jurisevic) and Mr James Edwards (Mr Edwards), cardiothoracic surgeons in the Adelaide metropolitan area in South Australia.
19 By about 1 January 2001, Mr Jurisevic had obtained the necessary formal qualifications to be entitled to practise as a cardiothoracic surgeon in that he had been admitted as a Fellow with effect from 1 January 2001.
Mr Jurisevic's official supervisor during the final year of his RACS Advanced Surgical Training in cardiothoracic surgery (which is part of the training required to be a cardiothoracic surgeon) was Mr Knight.
Mr Ross also supervised Mr Jurisevic's surgery during that period.
20 Mr Edwards was admitted as a Fellow in 1997 and since about July 2003, he has been the Director of the Cardiothoracic Surgical Unit of the Royal Adelaide Hospital (Royal Adelaide).
(b) The market 
 
21 Cardiothoracic surgical services are vital for patients who need them.
By reason of the matters referred to below, barriers to entry to the market for the supply of cardiothoracic surgical services are high.
22 Demand for cardiac surgical services, including open heart surgery, comes from adult members of the public with an acquired or congenital disease or disorder of the heart.
Of the 7 to 8 cardiothoracic surgeons practising in the Adelaide metropolitan area during the relevant period, only 1 to 2 of those surgeons predominantly provided thoracic surgical services.
No services were or are substitutable for cardiothoracic surgical services.
Patients requiring cardiothoracic surgical services would either be public patients (where facilities and the surgical services are provided by the State) or private patients (where facilities and the surgical services are usually paid for by the patient either directly or through their medical insurer).
23 The usual means by which patients obtained cardiac surgical services was firstly for the patient to obtain a referral from a general practitioner to a cardiologist.
If the cardiologist considered that cardiac surgery may be appropriate, the cardiologist would then refer the patient to a cardiothoracic surgeon.
24 Cardiac surgical services could only be provided in South Australia by cardiothoracic surgeons at hospitals which had:
 
 
 (1) a specialised operating theatre as well as specialised personnel to support and assist the cardiothoracic surgeon and provide post-operative care (the necessary facilities); and
 (2) a licence under the South Australian Health Commission Act 1976 (SA) in order to permit cardiothoracic surgeons to provide cardiac surgical services at the hospital (licence).
Such licences at the private hospitals Ashford, Flinders Private and Wakefield Hospital (Wakefield) were conditional upon each cardiothoracic surgeon providing cardiac surgical services also having held a formal appointment at a South Australian public teaching hospital, namely the FMC or the Royal Adelaide (licence condition).

 

25 For patients residing in or near South Australia, the nearest available cardiothoracic surgeons operated in the Adelaide metropolitan area where hospitals having the necessary facilities and licence were located.
Those patients generally travelled to Adelaide for cardiothoracic surgical services.
26 The only hospitals in South Australia which had both the necessary facilities and a licence were Wakefield, Ashford, the FMC, Flinders Private and Royal Adelaide.
27 Private patients generally accepted the recommendation of their cardiologists as to the cardiothoracic surgeon they would engage.
The cardiologist would recommend private patients to cardiothoracic surgeons based upon the following principal factors:
 
 
 (1) the reputation and standing of the available cardiothoracic surgeons for the type of surgery involved;
 (2) the quality of the referring cardiologist's working relationship with the available cardiothoracic surgeons; 
 (3) whether a cardiothoracic surgeon performed surgery in a hospital at which the referring cardiologist preferred to consult; and
 (4) the quality of the necessary facilities at the hospital or hospitals at which a cardiothoracic surgeon had obtained accreditation.

 

28 The provision of thoracic surgical services in South Australia by a cardiothoracic surgeon did not require an operating theatre or personnel specialised to the same degree as that required for cardiac surgical services.
Nor was a licence, with conditions similar to that required for the provision of cardiac surgery, required in order to permit cardiothoracic surgeons to provide thoracic surgical services at a hospital in South Australia.
(c) Cardiothoracic surgeons 
 
 29 Cardiothoracic surgeons provide cardiac surgical services or thoracic surgical services or both.
To offer services as a cardiothoracic surgeon to private patients in South Australia, a person must have:
 
(1) obtained qualifications in Australia by:
 
 
 
 (a) attaining the degrees of Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery (or their equivalent), which takes approximately 6 years;
 (b) completing the RACS Basic Surgical Training program, which takes approximately a further 2 years; and
 (c) completing the RACS Advanced Surgical Training program in cardiothoracic surgery under the supervision of cardiothoracic surgeons, which takes approximately a further 6 years; or 
 
 
 
 
 (2) been trained overseas to an appropriate and equivalent level, to the satisfaction of RACS; and 
 

(3) been admitted to, and gained fellowship of, RACS; and
 
 
 (4) obtained specialist registration as a cardiothoracic surgeon from the Medical Board of South Australia; and
 (5) been extended the right, benefit or privilege of providing cardiac surgical services, thoracic surgical services or both, as appropriate, (accreditation) by each hospital with the necessary facilities at which he or she proposed to provide the relevant services; and
 (6) have theatre time allocated to him or her at each hospital at which he or she had accreditation in South Australia and which had the necessary facilities and licence.

 

30 Additionally, the provision of cardiac surgical services by a cardiothoracic surgeon was dependent upon the cardiothoracic surgeon holding an appointment at a public teaching hospital in the Adelaide metropolitan area in South Australia, namely the FMC or the Royal Adelaide, where he or she provided cardiac surgical services, as a result of the condition attached to the private hospital licence.
31 A cardiothoracic surgeon needed to provide enough cardiac surgical services to maintain a sufficient level of competence.
32 In order for a person to gain admission to, and fellowship of, RACS, favourable references were required from each of the person's supervising cardiothoracic surgeons as nominated by RACS.
Also, both accreditation at private hospitals, and gaining an appointment at a public teaching hospital in South Australia was, for a newly admitted Fellow, greatly assisted by favourable references from the supervising cardiothoracic surgeons involved with his or her training.
33 It is usual for persons, after being admitted as Fellows, to spend an additional one to two years in an overseas placement before returning to a consultant position in Australia.
Although usual, however, it is not a requirement for newly admitted Fellows to undertake an overseas placement in order to provide services in the market.
(d) Competition between cardiothoracic surgeons 
 
34 During the period from the opening of the cardiac operating theatre at Ashford in or about 1991 until in or about July 2005 only cardiothoracic surgeons who held an appointment at the FMC from time to time provided cardiac surgical services at Ashford.
35 During the period from the opening of the cardiac operating theatre at Wakefield in or about 1994 until in or about the date of these submissions only cardiothoracic surgeons who held an appointment at the Royal Adelaide from time to time provided cardiac surgical services at Wakefield.
36 In those circumstances, I am satisfied that (as the ACCC alleges, and Mr Ross and Mr Knight admit) during the period of the conduct there was a market for the provision of cardiothoracic surgical services to private patients living in and near South Australia (the market).
THE ADMITTED CONDUCT OF MESSRS KNIGHT AND ROSS 
 Conduct in relation to Mr Jurisevic 
 
 37 In 2000, Mr Jurisevic was a cardiothoracic registrar at the FMC, working with Messrs Knight and Ross whilst completing his training to become a Fellow.
Mr Knight proposed that upon becoming a Fellow, Mr Jurisevic would continue to work with them as a senior registrar at the FMC through 2001, then undertake in 2002 a cardiothoracic surgery placement for approximately 18 months at the Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts.
Mr Knight subsequently received confirmation from the Brigham and Women's Hospital that Mr Jurisevic would be considered for such a placement.
Mr Jurisevic accepted the senior registrar's position for 2001.
38 In the course of Mr Jurisevic's final year of RACS Advanced Surgical Training, Mr Knight provided a positive reference to RACS about Mr Jurisevic's surgical competency and gave positive assessments concerning Mr Jurisevic, which included that Mr Jurisevic had impressive operative technique and that he would make an excellent surgeon in the future.
39 Mr Jurisevic completed his RACS Advanced Surgical Training program and was admitted as a Fellow with effect from 1 January 2001.
40 Following Mr Jurisevic's admission as a Fellow, in January 2001 he commenced a 12 month senior registrar's position at the FMC, operating on public patients.
41 
 
On or about 6 February 2001, Mr Jurisevic told Messrs Knight and Ross that he did not want to undertake an 18 month overseas placement, and that he intended to commence offering cardiothoracic surgical service, specialising in thoracic surgical services to private patients in Adelaide.
42 On or about 6 February 2001, Messrs Knight and Ross made an arrangement, a provision of which included that Messrs Knight and Ross would hinder or prevent Mr Jurisevic entering or supplying cardiothoracic surgical services in the market prior to his gaining further cardiothoracic surgical training (the provision).
43 The provision referred to in the preceding paragraph was likely to have the effect of substantially lessening competition in the market in that that provision and the giving effect to that provision:
 
 (1) signalled to newly admitted Fellows of the RACS that they may need a further period of clinical training before entering the market; and
 (2) raised the barriers to entry into the market by unilaterally imposing, as a condition for entry into the market, the requirement that newly admitted Fellows undertake a further period of clinical training.


44 A further effect of the provision referred to in [42] was that Mr Jurisevic was hindered from obtaining accreditation at Ashford for a period of time.
45 On or about 9 February 2001, Mr Jurisevic obtained his specialist registration as a cardiothoracic surgeon from the Medical Board of South Australia.
On or about that day, Mr Jurisevic resigned from his senior registrar position.
46 On or about 14 February 2001, Mr Jurisevic applied for accreditation at ACHA hospitals (the accreditation application) in which he nominated Mr David Robert Craddock (Mr Craddock), a cardiothoracic surgeon and the then Director of the Cardiothoracic Surgical Unit at the Royal Adelaide, and Mr John Stubberfield (Mr Stubberfield), a cardiothoracic surgeon at the Royal Adelaide, as referees.
Both Mr Craddock and Mr Stubberfield had been supervisors of Mr Jurisevic during his training.
47 Messrs Knight and Ross gave effect to the arrangement referred to in [42] above by engaging in the following conduct.
48 In or about February 2001, Mr Knight had a conversation with Dr Christopher Baggoley (Dr Baggoley), the then Consultant Medical Director at ACHA, in Dr Baggoley's office at Ashford.
Dr Baggoley was a member of the Medical Advisory Committee (MAC) at Ashford which considered applications for accreditation.
In that conversation, Mr Knight said words to the effect that Mr Jurisevic should not be extended accreditation by ACHA as it would be unsafe for patients if Mr Jurisevic operated independently because he was not ready; and that Mr Jurisevic required further supervision before becoming an independent surgeon.
49 In or about February 2001, Mr Ross also had a conversation with Dr Baggoley in Dr Baggoley's office at Ashford in which he said words to the effect that Mr Jurisevic should not be extended accreditation by ACHA as it would be unsafe for patients if Mr Jurisevic operated independently because he was not ready; and that Mr Jurisevic required further supervision before becoming an independent surgeon;
 
 50 Then, in or about mid-February 2001, Mr Knight had a conversation with Mr Craddock in which he said words to the effect that Mr Jurisevic had not finished his training.
51 By letter dated 20 February 2001, Mr Ross replied in writing to a query from Dr Andrew Sutherland, Chief (Medical), Division of Paediatric Surgery at the Women's  Children's Hospital in Adelaide where Mr Morris Peacock, a cardiothoracic surgeon who exclusively provided thoracic surgical services, had requested that Mr Jurisevic be extended accreditation.
The letter included statements to the effect that Messrs Knight and Ross considered that Mr Jurisevic was very undertrained to provide thoracic surgical services at the Women's  Children's Hospital; that they had grave reservations about Mr Jurisevic going into private practice; and that they felt that it would be entirely inappropriate to have Mr Jurisevic hold any sort of position at the Women's  Children's Hospital.
52 By letter dated 28 February 2001, Mr Knight wrote to Mr Ross (with the consent of Mr Ross) in the latter's capacity as Clinical Advisor, Cardiothoracic Surgery at ACHA; for the purpose of submission to the MAC, and so that the MAC could consider the letter in relation to the accreditation application.
That letter included statements to the effect that Mr Knight's opinion was that Mr Jurisevic was not equipped at that moment to perform to an appropriate level without supervision and guidance; and that patients may, during unsupervised surgery performed by Mr Jurisevic, be subjected to greater risk than would otherwise be the case;
 
 53 By letter dated 27 February 2001, Mr Craddock had written to ACHA regarding the accreditation application recommending that Mr Jurisevic be extended accreditation;
 
54 In or about March 2001, Mr Knight had a conversation with Mr Craddock about the reference provided by Mr Craddock in his letter of 27 February 2001.
During that conversation, Mr Knight said words to the effect that he was surprised that Mr Craddock had given the reference; and that he (Mr Knight) had enormous concerns about Mr Jurisevic's competency to act in an unsupervised fashion;
 
 55 Prior to 9 March 2001, Mr Knight, Mr Ross, Mr Stubberfield and Dr Robert Craig (Dr Craig), the then Clinical Director of the Department of Cardiovascular Services at the Royal Adelaide, met at Dr Craig's rooms at Kent Town.
During that meeting, Messrs Knight and Ross said words to the effect that Mr Stubberfield should agree to withdraw his support for Mr Jurisevic and not provide a reference for Mr Jurisevic; that Mr Jurisevic was not adequately trained; and that Mr Jurisevic was not competent to take on private practice.
56 Despite those various imprecations, on about 6 May 2001 RACS' Board of Cardiothoracic Surgery confirmed at a meeting of the Board, at which Mr Ross was present, that newly admitted Fellows, such as Mr Jurisevic, were legally entitled to practise independently.
Conduct in relation to Mr Edwards 
 
57 In about January 2003 Mr Edwards commenced practising in the Adelaide metropolitan area in South Australia as a cardiothoracic surgeon at Royal Adelaide and Wakefield.
In about July 2003, Mr Edwards became the Director of the Cardiothoracic Surgical Unit of the Royal Adelaide.
58 On or about 19 March 2003 Mr Edwards applied for accreditation as a cardiothoracic surgeon at ACHA hospitals which included Ashford, and by 5 May 2003, Messrs Knight and Ross had become aware of Mr Edwards' application.
59 That apparently prompted Mr Ross to write to Mr Edwards by letter dated 5 May 2003.
The letter was copied to Mr Stubberfield and Dr Craig.
The letter informed Mr Edwards that there was an existing arrangement between those cardiothoracic surgeons who held an appointment at the Royal Adelaide and those cardiothoracic surgeons who held an appointment at the FMC whereby the former surgeons would not seek to operate on private patients at Ashford and the latter would not seek to operate on private patients at Wakefield (the non-compete arrangement).
It invited Mr Edwards to become a party to the non-compete arrangement.
60 It also threatened Mr Edwards that Messrs Knight and Ross would seek to operate at Wakefield unless Mr Edwards agreed not to seek to compete with them at Ashford.
61 I am satisfied that, by reason of that conduct, Mr Ross attempted to make an arrangement with Mr Edwards containing provisions to the effect that:
 
 (1) Mr Edwards would not supply cardiothoracic surgical services to patients at Ashford in competition with Mr Ross; and
 (2) Mr Ross would not supply cardiothoracic surgical services to patients at Wakefield in competition with Mr Edwards.


62 I am also satisfied by reason of these matters that the attempted arrangement contained provisions which would have been likely to have the effect of substantially lessening competition in the market in that, if the arrangement were made, Mr Edwards and Mr Ross would have been prevented from supplying cardiothoracic surgical services in competition with each other at Ashford and at Wakefield respectively.
63 By letter dated 23 November 2004 Mr Knight also wrote to Mr Edwards.
