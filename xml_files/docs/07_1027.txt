 
1 On 13 July 2005, the first respondent gave notice under s 29 of the Native Title Act 1993 (Cth) (the Act) of its intention to grant exploration licence E47/1385 to the second respondent, an executive officer of the third respondent --- the intended ultimate holder of the licence (the grantee party).
The notice included a statement that the first respondent considered that the grant attracted the expedited procedure under the Act.
The proposed exploration licence is some 120.43 km 2 in area and is located 87 km north-west of Newman in the Shire of East Pilbara.
The Martu Idja Banyjima People (the native title party) have a registered native title claim which is overlapped by the area of the proposed licence.
The Yandi mine, operated by BHP Billiton Limited (BHP) is close to the area of the proposed exploration licence.
2 On 9 November 2005, the appellants, on behalf of the native title party, made an expedited procedure objection application to the National Native Title Tribunal (the Tribunal).
They contended that the future act did not comply with any of the three limbs referred to in s 237 of the Act.
3 Section 237 of the Act provides:
 
 A future act is an act attracting the expedited procedure if:
 
 
 (a) the act is not likely to interfere directly with the carrying on of the community or social activities of the persons who are the holders (disregarding any trust created under Division 6 of Part 2) of native title in relation to the land or waters concerned; and 
 
 
 
 (b) the act is not likely to interfere with areas or sites of particular significance, in accordance with their traditions, to the persons who are the holders (disregarding any trust created under Division 6 of Part 2) of the native title in relation to the land or waters concerned; and
 
 (c) the act is not likely to involve major disturbance to any land or waters concerned or create rights whose exercise is likely to involve major disturbance to any land or waters concerned.

4 On 2 June 2006, Deputy President Sumner of the Tribunal rejected the appellants' objection and determined that the proposed grant of exploration licence E47/1385 to the first respondent was an act attracting the expedited procedure.
On 20 June 2006, the native title party appealed.
The Tribunal's determination in respect of s 237(b) of the Act 
 
5 The issue in this appeal relates only to the Tribunal's decision in respect of s 237(b) of the Act, namely, that it was not likely that there would be interference with a site of particular significance to the native title party.
The site in question was a site known as the Barimunya site.
6 The relevant evidence relied upon by the native title party before the Tribunal comprised an affidavit sworn by Mr Slim Parker on 17 May 2006 and an affidavit of Mr Tim Parker sworn on the same day.
Each of the affidavits annexed a witness statement by the deponent.
The appellants also relied on a letter from Ms Fiona Sutherland, an anthropologist, dealing with the cultural heritage significance of the Barimunya site.
The Tribunal made a direction under s 155 of the Act that these documents, as well as the statement of contentions of the native title parties, were not to be disclosed.
At [24], the Tribunal observed:
 
 The affidavits of Slim and Timothy Parker and some other evidence were the subject of a non-disclosure or "confidentiality" directions [sic] pursuant to s 155 of the Act.
In these reasons I have only referred to those documents to the extent necessary to explain my decision and have not included material which should according to customary law and traditions remain confidential.


7 The confidential witness statements of Mr Slim Parker and Mr Tim Parker set out the reasons why the Barimunya site has special significance to the native title party.
The Tribunal did not disclose the content of this evidence in its reasons.
In his witness statement, Mr Slim Parker also said that the potential interference with the Barimunya site was a major concern when BHP developed the Yandi mine.
Mr Parker said he participated with members of the claim group on heritage surveys with BHP to map a boundary for the Barimunya site, and it was agreed with BHP that none of their employees or contractors would go onto the site and that it would be a "no go" area.
8 The native title party also provided to the Tribunal a copy of BHP's "Aboriginal Heritage Induction Handbook" which referred to the Barimunya site.
9 The Tribunal found that the Barimunya site was a site of particular significance to the native title party in accordance with their traditions.
At [42] the Tribunal said:
 
 I have no difficulty in finding that Barimunya is a site of particular significance to the native title party in accordance with their traditions.
The evidence provided by Mr Slim Parker, Mr Timothy Parker and Ms Fiona Sutherland, Anthropologist with Australian Cultural Heritage Management in a letter to Paul Sheiner of 3 April 2006 were the subject of confidentiality orders because of the sensitive nature of the site.
However, the native title party provided a copy of BHP Billiton's " Aboriginal Heritage Induction Handbook " which is publicly available and contains the following reference to Barimunya:
 
 
 "The three large hills that dominate the landscape at Yandi are a significant ethnographic site known as Barimunya.
In order to comply with the Western Australian Aboriginal Heritage Act, 1972 and the wishes of the heritage custodians BHP Billiton Iron Ore is committed to the management and protection of this site.
To ensure this, an area of land surrounding the hills has been made a Designated Area.
Part of this area has been fenced and marked with signs marking the Designated Area status.
"
 

10 The Tribunal went on to find that it was necessary to apply a predictive assessment as to whether the proposed future act was likely to give rise to the proscribed interference or disturbance.
This involved taking into account the grantee party's intention in relation to the protection of Aboriginal heritage sites.
In its reasons, the Tribunal drew a distinction between a "buffer zone" surrounding the site and the Barimunya site itself.
11 The Tribunal referred to the statutory protective regime under the Aboriginal Heritage Act 1972 (WA) (the AHA).
Section 17 of that Act provides that certain specified conduct in respect of an Aboriginal site, such as damaging or in any way altering the site, is an offence.
Section 18 provides for a means of obtaining an exemption from the provisions of s 17 in the prescribed circumstances.
The grantee party said that it would comply with its legal obligations under the AHA and would attempt to avoid Aboriginal sites but in the event there was a need to disturb a site, it would pursuant to s 18 make an application through the Aboriginal Cultural Material Committee, for consent to disturb the site.
12 The Tribunal said that the existence of the statutory protective regime and the expressed intention on the part of the grantee party to operate within the statutory regime was not decisive of the question of whether it was not likely there would be a proscribed interference with the Barimunya site under s 237(b) of the Act.
13 At [35], the Tribunal rejected the contention that the existence of the statutory protective regime meant that "in all cases the protective regime will be adequate to make s 237(b) interference unlikely" and said:
 
 Each case must be considered on its particular facts.
What is clear is that the Tribunal is entitled to have regard and give considerable weight to the Government party's site protection regime.


14 At [47], the Tribunal observed:
 
 As already explained, the possibility that a s 18 application may be made is not, since the amendment to the Act in 1998, decisive (as it was prior to 1998) in leading to a conclusion that there will be interference with sites of particular significance.
This possibility has always been a part of the Government party's regulatory regime which has been considered by the Tribunal and Federal Court in Little .
Its importance in deciding whether there is a real risk of interference with sites of particular significance will depend under the predictive assessment approach on all the circumstances.
If the evidence were to be that exploration could not be carried out without avoiding sites or that a s 18 application was virtually inevitable then these circumstances would need to be given greater weight.
It would still, however, need to be considered in the context of the number of sites, the consultative mechanism in place with the native title party through a heritage survey or otherwise and the attitude of the grantee party to site protection.


15 The Tribunal then went on to say at [48]:
 
 In this case I have had regard to the following factors in deciding that there is unlikely to be interference with the Barimunya site.
