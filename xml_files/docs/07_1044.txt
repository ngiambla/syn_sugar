 
1 The applicant applies for leave to issue a subpoena against the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC).
Order 27A rule 2(3)(a) of the Federal Court Rules assumes that applications for such leave will ordinarily be made without notice to the recipient of the proposed subpoena or to other parties in the proceeding.
However, here notice was in fact given.
Order 27 rule 4(1) gives a party to the proceeding standing to apply to set aside a subpoena.
The present application has been argued on the implicit basis that considerations which might warrant the setting aside of a subpoena were appropriate to the anterior question of whether leave to issue should be granted.
2 ASIC, the proposed recipient, does not object.
However the respondents Multiplex Limited and Multiple Funds Managements Limited (collectively Multiplex, a term which also includes the United Kingdom subsidiary of the group) have opposed the issue.
The Multiplex proceeding 
 
3 Multiplex contracted to build a new stadium at Wembley in the UK.
Substantial cost overruns and delays occurred.
Relevantly for present purposes, the applicant alleges that between 2 August 2004 and 23 February 2005 Multiplex knew or ought to have known that it was likely, or alternatively that there was a material risk, that the Wembley Stadium project would: 
 
 (a) substantially exceed budgeted costs;
 (b) fall further behind the construction schedule;
 (c) make a loss; and 

(d) substantially reduce forecasted profit earnings for the 2005 and 2006 financial years.
It is said that in contravention of its obligation of continuous disclosure under s 674 of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) Multiplex failed to notify the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX) of those facts.
4 The proceeding is brought as a representative proceeding under Pt IVA of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth).
The damage alleged by the applicant and group members is primarily the difference between the price paid in the relevant period for an interest in Multiplex securities and the "true value" of that interest.
5 The Multiplex defence is that at all times it was the fact, or alternatively Multiplex believed on reasonable grounds, that any increase in the cost of the project was recoverable by Multiplex from a number of sub-contractors and would not or was not likely to affect the overall profitability of the project.
ASIC investigation 
 
6 On 22 February 2005 ASIC commenced an investigation into events concerning the Wembley project between June 2004 and December 2005.
On 20 December 2006 Multiplex and ASIC agreed to an enforceable undertaking under s 93AA of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001 (Cth).
7 The undertaking recorded that in the course of the investigation ASIC reviewed over 3000 documents and either examined or took statements from 23 witnesses and obtained information from the UK.
