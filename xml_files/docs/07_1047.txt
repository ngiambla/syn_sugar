 
1 This application is made pursuant to the Workplace Relations Act 1996 (Cth) as it stood in 2003 and the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) and includes a claim for the tort of inducing a breach of contract or otherwise interfering with contractual relations.
The application relates to a chain of events which took place at or in connection with a building site in Wollongong, New South Wales, during September and October 2003.
2 The first applicant is A  L Silvestri Pty Ltd ("Silvestri P/L"), the family company of Mr Antonio Silvestri and his wife Mrs Laura Silvestri, which carried on business as a demolition and excavation contractor on construction sites in the Wollongong area.
The second applicant, Mr Nigel Hadgkiss, was an employee of the Commonwealth at the time these proceedings were instituted and had powers delegated to him by the Employment Advocate to make an application in respect of conduct in contravention of Pt XA of the Workplace Relations Act .
No point is now taken as to his standing.
3 There are five respondents.
The first respondent, the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union ("the CFMEU"), is an organisation registered as an organisation of employees under the Workplace Relations Act .
The second respondent ("CFMEU NSW") is the New South Wales branch of the CFMEU, is registered as an organisation under the Industrial Relations Act 1996 (NSW) and is a body corporate by virtue of s 222 of that Act.
The remaining respondents are individuals connected with the CFMEU and CFMEU NSW.
In 2003 Mr Peter Primmer was a full-time organiser employed by CFMEU NSW.
He was a member of both the CFMEU and CFMEU NSW.
Mr Michael Lane was employed as a full-time organiser for the CFMEU and was an elected conference delegate of that organisation.
He was a member of both the CFMEU and CFMEU NSW.
Mr David Kelly was employed by CFMEU NSW and was an elected official performing duties as an organiser for each of the CFMEU and CFMEU NSW.
For most purposes it is not necessary to distinguish between CFMEU and CFMEU NSW in these reasons.
It is sufficient to refer to the Union.
4 LGB Contracting Pty Ltd ("LGB") is not a party, but is central to the case.
LGB was the developer and builder of a substantial project at 26---28 Market Street Wollongong.
It had not previously built in Wollongong.
Demolition and excavation works were required before construction could commence.
Mr Louis Grujoski ("Grujoski") was one of the two directors of LGB --- the other being his brother, Mr Nick Grujoski.
BRIEF OUTLINE OF THE CASES 
 
5 The applicants' case.
From about 11 September 2003 Lane had several meetings with management personnel of LGB.
His objective was to cause LGB to enter into a site agreement and an enterprise bargaining agreement ("EBA") with the Union to cover the project and also to cause all subcontractors engaged on the site to have an EBA with the Union.
That would effectively ensure that the project was manned only by Union members.
It was made clear that only Union approved subcontractors should be engaged.
Lane made threats of industrial action and general disruption to back up his demands.
6 On the day of Lane's first visit, two inspectors from WorkCover NSW ("WorkCover") attended the site at his request concerning occupational health and safety policies.
As a result, the site was shut down for two days.
7 The first test of strength occurred when Lane learned in mid-October 2003 that LGB proposed to engage Silvestri P/L as excavation subcontractor to replace the existing subcontractor who had been sacked.
Silvestri P/L had no agreement with the Union and Antonio Silvestri was not a union member.
That decision had been made by the newly appointed site or project manager.
Lane and Primmer attended the site on 20 October 2003 and threatened severe repercussions if Silvestri P/L attempted to work on the site.
8 Early on the following day, Silvestri P/L commenced work, with Antonio Silvestri himself operating the excavator.
A fleet of trucks was engaged in carting excavated material from the site.
The previous excavator had operated a similar system for some time.
At about 9.30 am Lane, having spoken to one of the principals of LGB, arrived by car at the site, followed later by Primmer and Kelly in another car.
Lane effectively shut the site by parking his car across the vehicular entrance.
Threats by the Union officials, plus action on the part of personnel from the Wollongong City Council ("the Council") (initiated by the Union officials) led to the site being shut down for some days.
As a result of the threats by Union officials, on the afternoon of 21 October 2003 LGB decided to terminate the services of Silvestri P/L.
During the events of 21 October 2003, Kelly told one of the truck drivers that he, and any other worker on site, had to be a member of the Union to be allowed to work on site.
9 The termination took place on the following day after a further meeting of LGB personnel with Union officials where further threats were made.
Silvestri P/L was replaced by a subcontractor nominated by the Union officials.
The Union officials again sought to have LGB enter an EBA.
Once the new excavation contractor came on site there was no Union inspection or inspection by WorkCover or Council officials.
