 
1 This is an appeal from a decision of Jarrett FM of 12 October 2005 ( Gauci v Kennedy [2005] FMCA 1505) where his Honour summarily dismissed a claim of Mr Gauci ("the appellant") for relief against the second respondent for a breach of Pt II Div 3 Sex Discrimination Act 1984 (Cth) ("SD Act").
2 The claim was dismissed by the learned Federal Magistrate pursuant to Federal Magistrates Court Rules (FMCR) r 13.10, which reads as follows:
 
 The Court may order that a proceeding be stayed, or dismissed generally or in relation to any claim for relief in the proceeding, if it appears to the Court that: 

(a) no reasonable cause of action is disclosed in relation to the proceeding or claim for relief; or
 
(b) the proceeding or claim for relief is frivolous or vexatious; or
 
(c) the proceeding or claim for relief is an abuse of the process of the Court.
3 On 6 July 2006 I granted the appellant leave to file and serve out of time a notice of appeal from the decision of Jarrett FM, and leave to appeal from the decision of Jarrett FM: Gauci v Kennedy [2006] FCA 869.
The background and facts of this matter are set out in that decision, and I explained in some detail principles referable to summary dismissal.
It is unnecessary to repeat those principles here, other than to acknowledge that the power to dismiss an application summarily must be exercised with great caution and only in the clearest of cases.
Hearing before the Federal Magistrate 
 
4 In relation to the application for summary dismissal by the second respondent, the learned Federal Magistrate recognised the caution with which such applications should be approached.
His Honour examined the relevant legislation, in particular ss 5 , 14 , 28A , 28F , 94 , 105 and 106 of the SD Act .
