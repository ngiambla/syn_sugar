 
1 At a community meeting in South Hedland on 25 October 2006 ('the meeting'), 68 members of the Njamal community ('the Njamal members') resolved to amend the description of the claim group on whose behalf this application for a determination of native title is brought ('the first resolution').
They also resolved ('the second resolution') to remove 11 of the 17 persons who currently comprise the applicant and to include three new persons as applicant ('the replacement applicant').
One of the persons to be removed was Eddie McPhee ('Mr McPhee').
The resolution, as it applied to Mr McPhee, was said to be made to address his alleged failure to attend meetings and sign documents relevant to the claim.
2 The current applicant and the replacement applicant have each filed a notice of motion.
The first notice of motion, filed by the current applicant, seeks orders to amend the claimant application to alter the description of the claim group to conform to the first resolution and to address certain technical requirements.
In the second notice of motion, the nine members constituting the replacement applicant seek orders that they replace the current applicant, in accordance with the second resolution.
Mr McPhee opposes the orders sought in the second motion.
He says that the meeting was ' flawed '.
No other person opposes the orders sought.
Mr McPhee does not oppose the orders sought in the first notice of motion.
The first motion 
 
3 These claimant proceedings are brought under s 61(1) of the Act which provides that the persons authorised by all the persons who hold the common or group rights and interests comprising the claimed native title ('the claim group') may (relevantly) bring the application (ss 253 and 61 (1) of the Act).
The persons who are so authorised are, jointly, the ' applicant ' (s 61(2)(c) of the Act).
4 The applicant relies on O 13 r 2(1) of the Federal Court Rules ('the Rules') which permits the amendment of ' any document in the proceeding '.
That applies to a native title determination application, subject to the constraints imposed by ss 64 and 66B of the [2003] FCA 1423 ; Act ( Anderson v Western Australia (2003) 134 FCR 1 at [36] per French J; Strickland v Western Australia [1999] FCA 221 ; (1999) 89 FCR 117 at [9] per Nicholson J).
The constraints imposed by ss 64 and 66B are not relevant to the first motion.
5 The amendment to alter the claim group description is explained as follows.
The 17 persons currently named as applicant bring these proceedings ' on behalf of the Njamal people '.
However, in the application on the Court file, the claim group as described in Schedule A is identical to the members of the current applicant, the same 17 people ('the current claim group').
There is no explanation why this is so.
Anthropological evidence is to the effect that the Njamal people are not limited to the current claim group and that meetings of the Njamal people to consider the native title claim have never been so restricted.
The unchallenged evidence is that the Njamal people, including those named as the current applicant-current claim group and their advisors, have always understood that the correct claim group was to be the larger group of Njamal people.
It is that larger group that has consistently attended community meetings and made decisions relevant to the application.
6 The proposed amendment is to extend the members of the claim group and properly and more accurately to identify them.
Members of the current applicant and of the proposed replacement applicant and the Njamal people present at the meeting have approved of the amended description.
7 Under traditional Njamal law and custom, membership of the claim group can be described by way of descent from Njamal apical ancestors.
The proposed amendment is to replace the description in Schedule A with the following description ('the replacement claim group'): 
 
 'The native title claim group, on whose behalf this application is brought consists of: 
 
 (a) the descendants of: 
 
 Ngurrpangu / Sally; 
 Yirlkurani / William Ball; 
 Pularji and Minparingu / Daisy; 
 Walykunpangu; 
 Mujayakirrirri; 
 Mikarnipirti; 
 Kutjikurtapa / Fred Mitchell; 
 Putangaja; 
 Jarlapangu / Billy Ball; 
 Wijiringu; 
 Yirapinya; 
 Ngamalykarinya; 
 Wanarngykuranya / Tommy; and 
 
 
 
 (b) the following incorporated members: 
 Reggie Malana; and 
 Colin Malana.
' 
 
 

8 The replacement claim group is based on the anthropological research carried out to date identifying those Njamal persons who can claim native title rights and interests in the claim area.
It is also the description that was discussed and approved at the meeting, prior to passage of the first resolution.
9 The amendment is consistent with the scheme of the Act.
The proper identification of the claim group is a matter of fundamental importance to the claim.
Schedule A of the application should be amended to identify the replacement claim group.
