 INTRODUCTION 
 
1 The applicant appeals under s 44(1) of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth) ('AAT Act') from a decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal ('the Tribunal') made on 4 October 2005.
The Tribunal set aside a decision of the applicant made under the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 (Cth) ('VE Act') that the death of the respondent's husband ('the veteran') was not war-caused, and substituted a decision that the veteran's death was war-caused.
FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND 
 
2 The veteran, born in 1923, served with the Australian Army from 6 April 1942 to 8 August 1946.
By reason of his service with the 112 Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment in the Northern Territory in 1943 and 1944 the entire period of the veteran's military service was operational service.
3 The veteran died on 14 November 2001, aged 78 years.
His death certificate stated that the cause of his death was myelofibrosis which he had suffered for 4 years, and oesophageal varices which he had suffered for 2 years.
4 On 11 February 2002 the respondent lodged a claim with the applicant in respect of the veteran's death.
The applicant refused the claim because the cause of myelofibrosis was unknown and therefore the disease could not be related to the veteran's service.
The respondent applied to the Veterans' Review Board ('the Board') for review of the applicant's decision, and the Board affirmed the decision.
5 The respondent then sought review of the Board's decision by the Tribunal who set aside the Board's decision and substituted the decision the subject of this application.
6 On 2 November 2005, the applicant appealed to this Court from the decision of the Tribunal.
LEGISLATIVE FRAMEWORK 
 
7 Section 13(1) of the VE Act renders the Commonwealth liable to pay pension to a dependent of a veteran where the death of the veteran was war-caused.
The circumstances in which a veteran's death is taken to be war-caused are set out in s 8(1) of the VE Act.
