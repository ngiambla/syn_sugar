 BACKGROUND 
 
1 This case involves claims under the Disability Discrimination Act 1992 (Cth) (DDA) by a prisoner with a back injury.
The claims arise out of transport that he undertook between various prisons and courts, and a period of detention in the Charlotte Management Unit of Port Phillip Prison.
2 Between 17 July 1998 and his release on 5 March 2004, the applicant, Mr Rainsford, was a prisoner of the State of Victoria.
At various times, he was held at three different prisons: Port Phillip Prison, Ararat Prison and Barwon Prison.
3 Pursuant to s 4 of the Corrections Act 1986 (Vic), any person detained in prison is deemed to be in the custody of the Secretary to the Department of Justice (Secretary).
The Secretary appoints the Commissioner of the Office of Correctional Services: Corrections Act s 8A(1).
The Office of the Correctional Services Commissioner (OCSC) is responsible for sentence management of all prisoners in Victoria, a function that is performed by its Sentence Management Unit, which has a delegate located in each prison.
Pursuant to s 21(1) of the Corrections Act , the Governor of a prison is responsible for the welfare of prisoners held within that prison.
4 The Department of Justice is an emanation of the State and shares its legal identity for the purposes of the DDA.
5 The State has entered into a Prison Services Agreement with Australian Correctional Facilities Pty Ltd (ACF) for the provision of correctional services at Port Phillip Prison.
In accordance with the Prison Services Agreement, ACF subcontracted the operation and management of Port Phillip Prison to Group 4 Correction Services Pty Ltd. Group 4 Correction Services Pty Ltd is now know as GSL Custodial Services Pty Ltd (GSL), the second respondent.
6 In this proceeding, Mr Rainsford makes claims under the DDA in respect of two matters.
The first concerns transport he was required to undertake between the various prisons at which he was housed, and between those prisons and courts in Melbourne.
He claims that he was discriminated against in respect of a back injury, in that he was required to travel in prison transportation vans for up to two hours without the opportunity to properly stretch and exercise his back.
I will call this claim the 'transport claim'.
The second claim, which I will call the 'Charlotte Management Unit claim', concerns a period of 9 days in September 2001 in which Mr Rainsford was held in a cell in the Spine area of the Charlotte Management Unit at Port Phillip Prison.
The discrimination alleged again concerns his back injury and is said to consist of a failure to provide him with adequate opportunities to stretch and exercise his back and the provision of a low bed which he could not make without further aggravating his back.
7 The State is a respondent to both claims; GSL is a respondent to the Charlotte Management Unit claim only.
At the hearing, the two respondents were separately represented but their interests did not differ.
Counsel for the State made submissions in respect of the transport claim and relied on the submissions of counsel for GSL in respect of the Charlotte Management Unit claim.
It is therefore convenient for most purposes to refer to them as the respondents, even when only the transport claim is being discussed.
Where it is necessary to distinguish between the two, I will refer to them as the State and GSL.
THE PROCEEDINGS 
 
8 The proceedings arise out of complaints made by Mr Rainsford to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission in March 2000 and September 2001.
They were resolved adversely to Mr Rainsford and led to him instituting proceedings both in this Court and the Federal Magistrates Court.
9 The first proceeding was commenced in this Court against the State and concerned the transport claim only.
It was remitted to the Federal Magistrates Court on 28 September 2001.
In the Federal Magistrates Court McInnis FM delivered judgment on 28 November 2001 dismissing Mr Rainsford's application on the grounds that the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1986 (Cth) (HREOC Act) and the DDA did not bind the State of Victoria: Rainsford v Victoria [2001] FMCA 115.
Subsequent to this order, the HREOC Act was amended retrospectively to bind the State.
Mr Rainsford appealed to the Full Federal Court which, by consent, ordered that the appeal be allowed and the matter remitted to the Federal Magistrates Court.
10 The second proceeding was filed in the Federal Magistrates Court on 8 November 2001 against both current respondents.
It concerned the Charlotte Management Unit claim and was consolidated with the proceeding remitted from the Full Federal Court.
The combined proceeding was heard before Bryant CFM in September 2003.
In June 2004, before she had delivered judgment, the Chief Federal Magistrate was appointed Chief Justice of the Family Court.
Regrettably, the matter had to be reheard before a different Federal Magistrate, Raphael FM.
That hearing took place on 26---27 August 2004 and was, pursuant to a direction made by the Federal Magistrate, a hearing of certain separate questions.
Raphael FM answered the two separate questions adversely to Mr Rainsford and, in consequence of those unfavourable answers, dismissed the entire proceeding: Rainsford v Victoria [2004] FMCA 707 ; (2004) 184 FLR 110.
11 Mr Rainsford then appealed to the Full Federal Court which unanimously found that the separate questions posed by Raphael FM were inappropriate to answer because they relied on facts that had not been found or agreed between the parties: Rainsford v Victoria [2005] FCAFC 163 ; (2005) 144 FCR 279.
The Full Court remitted the matter back to the Federal Magistrates Court.
12 Finally, on 6 December 2005, after hearing submissions from counsel, Walters FM determined that it was appropriate to transfer the proceeding to this Court.
No party objected to this course.
13 I must also mention a related proceeding.
In September 2001, Mr Rainsford commenced a related proceeding in the Supreme Court of Victoria seeking judicial review of the decision to move him to the Charlotte Management Unit.
That proceeding was dismissed on 23 November 2001.
It is not challenged in this proceeding, and nor could it be.
I mention it only because some of the affidavit evidence given in that proceeding has been put in evidence before me.
THE EVIDENCE 
 Mr Rainsford's Condition 
 
14 Mr Rainsford sustained a back injury while working as a greenkeeper in 1996.
He was operated on by Mr Jensen, a neurosurgeon, in December 1996, for a disc prolapse in the L5/S1 area.
Mr Rainsford gave evidence that Mr Jensen advised him that he should undertake a stretching and exercise regime to guard against back pain and minimise the risk of aggravating his condition.
Ordinarily, he does this regime daily.
15 On 9 April 1999 Mr Rainsford was sentenced in the County Court of Victoria to a period of imprisonment of 5 years and 9 months with a non-parole period of 4 years.
The conviction was for assault with intent to rape and two counts of wilful and obscene exposure.
16 In early 1999, while in prison on remand, he was examined by a visiting orthopaedic surgeon, Mr Rush, who provided him with a medical certificate noting that he was not fit to undertake work involving lifting more than 10 kg or repetitive bending.
Prior to obtaining the certificate, he had done several months of manual labour in prison.
17 Mr Rainsford was seen by an orthopaedic surgeon, Dr Phillips, for medico-legal purposes on 3 March 2000.
In his report of the same day, Dr Phillips noted that Mr Rainsford's condition appeared to have deteriorated since his operation.
He offered two possible diagnoses for this deterioration.
The first was a further prolapse of the back, the second was post-operative scarring.
He recommended that further tests be carried out to determine which of these alternatives applied.
18 A CT scan was conducted on 26 April 2000 and an MRI scan on 11 August 2000.
There was some disagreement as to the interpretations of these scans.
The MRI scan noted that as well as some scarring at the L5/S1 where the surgery had taken place there was a mild to moderate disc bulge at T12/L1.
The CT scan, on the other hand, made no mention of a secondary disc bulge.
In his oral evidence, Dr Phillips preferred to rely on the MRI scan's reference to a bulge at T12/L1, but Dr Dohrmann, a neurosurgeon called by the respondents, gave evidence that in his opinion an MRI scan of a patient who has undergone back surgery is unreliable and that the CT scan should be preferred.
19 During his time in prison, Mr Rainsford was examined by a number of medical practitioners as part of an outpatients clinic that was available at least one day per week.
It appears that all of the medical staff at Port Phillip Prison were provided by St Vincent's Correctional Health Service.
There is no suggestion that any of them was an employee of either respondent or that the respondents were directly responsible for their actions; Mr Allgood, then the General Manager of Ararat and Langi Kal Kal prisons, gave evidence that they were contractors of the State.
St Vincent's Correctional Health Service kept medical files for prisoners.
These were separate from the Individual Management Plan (IMP) files maintained by the respondents and were not accessible to the respondents.
The contents of the medical files were only accessible to medical staff and prison authorities were only aware of information on medical files if it had been separately provided to them, for example if a certificate had been placed on a prisoner's IMP file.
Medical certificates in evidence in this case fall into this category.
20 Mr Rainsford sought and obtained a number of medical certificates from the medical staff.
A number of these certificates were placed on his IMP file.
There are two types of medical certificate.
The first is headed 'Medical Certificate'.
Its printed sections pertain predominantly to a prisoner's capacity to work.
It allows the medical practitioner completing the form to certify that the prisoner is unfit for work, is ready to resume work, has attended a health care appointment or is fit to undertake certain activities.
The second type of medical certificate is headed 'Medical Advice Certificate'.
It has fewer printed sections and is therefore more widely applicable than a 'Medical Certificate'.
Mr Greene summarised them as follows: "A medical advice certificate permits a prisoner as a consequence of a health issue to have an item or a modification outside of standard prison issue or stipulation.
A medical certificate relates to work capacity and attendance".
For ease of reference, in these reasons I will refer to both types of certificate as "medical certificates" unless specificity is required.
21 Mr Rainsford's certificates are largely similar.
The majority refer to him only being able to perform light duties, and being unfit for heavy lifting, bending or sitting for long periods.
A number advise that he is unfit for work for specified periods.
Two certificates do no more than request that Mr Rainsford be provided with an extra pillow.
Nothing in any of the certificates refers to him being restricted in travelling or to his conditions in the Spine area cell.
22 Mr Rainsford was asked why none of the certificates refer to him being restricted in travelling.
He replied that he spoke to medical personnel about his difficulties in travelling in prison vans but their response had been that they had no power to direct the prison how to transport him and that all they could do was recommend that he was unfit for work.
He said that it should have been apparent to the authorities from the repeated references to him being unable to sit for long periods that this was true both of sitting for work purposes and sitting for travel purposes.
23 The severity of Mr Rainsford's back injury was contested by the respondents.
They referred to a series of diary notes contained within Mr Rainsford's Local Management Plan Progress Notes.
