The action is brought by an investor, P Dawson Nominees Pty Ltd.
It sues on its own behalf and on behalf of all investors who (1) during a defined period acquired an interest in securities in, or issued by, one of the respondents; (2) suffered loss and damage by reason of the conduct alleged against the respondents; and (3) had "as at the commencement of the [the] proceeding entered a litigation funding agreement with International Litigation Funding Partners, Inc.
(ILF).
" The question in issue is whether the last criterion is permissible.
2 Multiplex is a public company whose shares are listed on the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX).
MFM, a related company, is the responsible entity (see Part 5C of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth)) of both the Multiplex Property Trust, a managed investment scheme established on 19 September 2003 and the Multiplex SITES Trust established on 12 November 2004.
Ordinary shares in Multiplex give the holder an interest in Multiplex group stapled securities --- that is an ordinary share in Multiplex is stapled to an ordinary unit in the Multiplex Property Trust.
Stapled securities are traded on the ASX.
Investors can also acquire an interest in Multiplex Step-up Income Distributing Trust Issued Exchangeable Securities (Multiplex SITES).
Multiplex SITES are also traded on the ASX.
3 Multiplex is a substantial construction company with operations in several countries.
In 2000 a Multiplex subsidiary, Multiplex Constructions (UK) Ltd, entered into a contract to design and build the Wembley Stadium at Wembley in the United Kingdom.
It is common knowledge that the stadium was not completed within time and the final cost of construction well exceeded the budgeted cost.
This had a substantial adverse effect on profits and consequently on the price of Multiplex shares, stapled securities and Multiplex SITES.
4 In this action P Dawson Nominees seeks to recover the losses it has suffered on its investment.
It relies on several causes of action, of which I need mention only two.
First, P Dawson Nominees contends that by about 2 August 2004 Multiplex knew, or reasonably would have known, that it was likely (or at least there was a material risk) that the Wembley Stadium project was well behind schedule.
It alleges that the information about the project and its affect on profits was material information which (contrary to the listing rules of the ASX) the Multiplex group failed to disclose to the ASX.
A failure to comply with the disclosure requirements of the listing rules is a breach of s 674 of the Corporations Act permitting the court under s 1317HA to order that damages suffered by any person be made good.
5 Second, P Dawson Nominees alleges that the Multiplex group misrepresented the situation regarding the Wembley Stadium project in several reports to the ASX and in other reports to the public.
The reporting history is as follows.
On 18 August 2004 Multiplex group announced that work on the Wembley Stadium project continued to progress at a rate which would permit completion of the project ahead of schedule and that a contractual dispute with the structural steelwork subcontractor would not affect the construction program or impact on Multiplex group earnings.
In its Annual Report for 2004 it was stated that nothing had arisen since the end of the previous financial period that was likely to effect significantly the Multiplex group operations.
