 
1 Before me is an amended notice of appeal from the decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal ("the Tribunal") constituted by Senior Member McCabe, given on 17 February 2006.
In that decision the Tribunal affirmed the imposition of an administrative penalty of 50% of the respondent's taxation shortfall on the respondent pursuant to s 284 -90 of Sch 1 to the Taxation Administration Act 1953 (Cth) ("the Act "), but varied the Commissioner's decision not to remit any part of that penalty.
The Tribunal ordered that part of the penalty should be remitted such that the penalty was equivalent to 25% of the respondent's tax shortfall.
2 The Commissioner seeks the following orders:
 
(a) the appeal be allowed;
 
(b) so much of the Tribunal's decision as varied the decision under review by remitting part of the administrative penalty imposed by the Act be set aside;
 
(c) in lieu thereof, the Court to order that the decision under review be wholly affirmed;
 
(d) no order as to costs of and incidental to the appeal.
3 Questions of law raised in the amended notice of appeal are whether:
 
(a) circumstances relevant to the exercise of the remission discretion conferred by s 298-20 of Sch 1 to the Act ("the remission discretion") are not restricted to those relating to the conduct of a taxpayer or at least the taxpayer's circumstances;
 
(b) particularly having regard to the separate provision in the Act for the payment of general interest charge in respect of a tax shortfall, the fact that a refund of the tax shortfall amount in question was never made to the respondent is an irrelevant consideration in the exercise of the remission discretion;
 
(c) the Act , rather than the Commissioner, imposes the penalty the subject of the remission decision at the rate of 50% and the Commissioner thereby becomes entitled to collect such penalty;
 
(d) the fact that a refund of the tax shortfall amount in question was never made to the taxpayer meant that no harm was done is an irrelevant consideration in the exercise of the remission discretion;
 
(e) before exercising the remission discretion it is necessary that there be special circumstances;
 
(f) considerations relevant to the exercise of the remission discretion include:
 
 
 (1) the amount of the tax shortfall;
 (2) a failure on the part of a taxpayer when lodging an amended business activity statement (BAS) with the Commissioner to consult with a former tax agent or solicitor having knowledge of whether a supply shown on the amended BAS was a taxable supply;
 (3) that the Act imposed a penalty at the rate of 50%;
 (4) that the whole of the shortfall amount resulted from recklessness as to the operation of a taxation law; and
 (5) the existence or otherwise of special circumstances.

 
 BACKGROUND 
 
4 The facts of this case are set out in detail in the reasons for decision of the Tribunal.
In summary, they are as follows:
 
 
 1.
The respondent had been a businessman in New Zealand, and moved to Australia in 2000 following the death of his wife.
His late wife had always looked after his tax affairs.
2.
Having lived off capital, the respondent decided to adopt a more active investment strategy, including purchasing a commercial property tenanted by a number of retailers ("the property").
The purchase of the property as a going concern was completed on 31 October 2003 for the purchase price of $1,885,000.
3.
The respondent retained a tax agent, Mr Paul Mugridge, to assist him with his tax affairs.
Mr Mugridge completed a business activity statement (BAS) for the quarter ending 31 December 2003, confirming that the sale was not subject to GST, and that there was no basis for seeking an input tax credit (ITC).
4.
The respondent completed the next three BASs himself.
He said that he was under the impression that Mr Mugridge was going out of business, so he approached a new tax agent, Mr Gillard, to assist him in the latter part of 2004.
5.
Mr Gillard reviewed documentation he received from the respondent including a partial copy of an earlier version of the contract of sale of the property, and asked the respondent why there had not been a claim for an ITC on the purchase of the property.
The respondent did not know.
6.
Several attempts were apparently made by the respondent and Ms Anderson, an employee of Mr Gillard, to contact the vendor to discuss the issue.
Apparently no contact was made with either Mr Mugridge or the respondent's solicitor, who had relevant information.
7.
On 8 December 2004 Mr Gillard lodged an amended BAS relating to the quarter ending 31 December 2003 seeking an ITC.
The Tribunal noted that there was dispute concerning the events pertaining to lodgement of the BAS - the respondent stated that he did not instruct Mr Gillard or Ms Anderson to lodge the amended BAS, and Mr Gillard did not know why the BAS was lodged at that time.
Ms Anderson was not available for cross-examination at the time of the Tribunal hearing.
8.
It was not in dispute that a claim for an ITC was not open to the respondent in circumstances where the property in question was sold as a going concern: s 38.325 A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Act 1999 (Cth) (GST Act ).
The parties agreed that the amended BAS should never have been filed.
9.
No money was refunded to the respondent, and the Commissioner imposed an administrative penalty of 50% of the amount of the credit that had been wrongly claimed on the basis that the claim was made recklessly as provided in s 284-90 of the Act .

 
 DECISION OF THE COMMISSIONER 
 
5 The respondent objected to imposition of the penalty, and subsequently the decision of the Commissioner not to remit the penalty.
Both objections were rejected by the Commissioner.
6 With respect to the objection of the respondent concerning the remission of the penalty, the Commissioner informed the respondent that there were not sufficient grounds upon which the Commissioner could exercise his discretion under s 298-20(1) of Sch 1 to the Act and remit all or part of the administrative penalty imposed.
In making this decision, the Commissioner took into account Law Administration Practice Statement PS LA 2004/5 which provides that there is no general remission of administrative penalties for shortfall amounts unless there are exceptional circumstances to justify remission either in full or in part.
