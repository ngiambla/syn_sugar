Each of the contraventions related to the underpayment of wages to a particular employee over a period of about five years.
The underpayments, in total, amounted to $96,664.76.
2 The respondents are husband and wife.
They conduct a trucking business which trades as "Fitzpatrick's Transport Service".
The business is not incorporated.
The business operates a small fleet of trucks from a base in Charlton in north-west Victoria.
The first respondent is one of six drivers who work in the business.
The second respondent performs clerical duties relating to the payment of wages and accounts.
She attends the office on one day each week for these purposes.
The day to day administration of the business is in the hands of an employee manager.
3 In 1991 the first respondent offered employment as a casual driver to Mr Roy Paynting.
Mr Paynting accepted the offer and worked in the business on a casual basis from May 1991 until 23 June 2004.
Thereafter, until 29 March 2006, Mr Paynting was employed on a full time or part time basis.
4 The main reason that the underpayments occurred was that the first respondent offered, and Mr Paynting accepted, a contractual term that Mr Paynting's remuneration should be calculated at a fixed hourly rate.
During the six year period, commencing on 8 February 2001, to which this proceeding relates, that hourly rate was originally $12 and was later increased to $13 and $14.
At all relevant times these rates were lower than the wages payable for ordinary hours under the Award, and no account was taken of additional amounts prescribed by the Award for overtime, weekend, and public holiday work.
5 The respondents assert that they were unaware, until June 2006, of either the existence of the Award or the fact that their business had been "roped in" as a respondent to it.
The respondents became aware of their obligations under the Award after Mr Paynting complained about underpayment of his wages to the Office of Workplace Services and that Office wrote to the respondents about the complaint.
Between June 2006 and April 2007 discussions took place between the respondents and their representatives on the one hand and the Office of Workplace Services on the other.
Those discussions related to the question of liability and the calculation of underpaid wages.
This led to the acceptance by the respondents that they had underpaid Mr Paynting by $96,664.76.
That amount was paid to Mr Paynting on 11 April 2007.
6 Between 8 February 2001 and 26 March 2006 s 178 of the Act relevantly provided:
 
 "178(1) Where an organisation or person bound by an award...breaches a term of the award...a penalty may be imposed by the Court... 
 
 (2) Subject to subsection (3), where: 
 
 
 (a) 2 or more breaches of a term of an award...are committed by the...person; and 
 
 
 (b) the breaches arose out of a course of conduct by the...person; 
 
 the breaches shall, for the purposes of this section, be taken to constitute a single breach of the term.
" 
 

Subsection (3) is of no present relevance.
Subsection (4) provided for maximum penalties for breaches.
It will be necessary to return to the question of the applicable maximum penalties which were increased by legislation in 2004.
7 Regulation 2.14 of Chapter 7 of the Workplace Relations Regulations 2006 provided that, after the commencement of the Workplace Relations Amendment (Work Choices) Act 2005 on 27 March 2006, an application could be made to the Court for the imposition of a penalty under s 178 in respect of breaches which occurred prior to 27 March 2006.
8 The former s 178 was amended and renumbered as s 719 with effect from 27 March 2006.
Section 719(1) differs significantly in its terms from s 178(1) but it effects no substantial alteration which is of relevance for present purposes.
Section 719(2) is in substantially the same terms as s 178(2).
No changes were made to the level of penalties applicable to an individual for breaches of an Award.
Section 719 only applied to three of the days covered by the application: Mr Paynting's employment by the respondents ceased on 29 March 2006.
9 As already noted the maximum penalties prescribed by the Act were varied in 2004.
