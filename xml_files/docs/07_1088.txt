 
1 On 11 May 2007, I gave the appellant leave to appeal out of time from a decision of a Federal Magistrate given on 8 February 2007, limited to the manner of exercise of the discretion under s 116(1) of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) (the Act) by the Migration Review Tribunal (the Tribunal): see Lau v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 691.
2 The appellant was granted a Student (Temporary) (Class TU) Sub Class 573 (Higher Education Sector) visa (the visa) on 15 July 2003.
The delegate of the first respondent cancelled the visa on 23 March 2005 for breach of Condition 8101 imposed upon the visa, namely that the appellant must not engage in work in Australia.
The appellant contravened that condition.
In the circumstances, the delegate had a discretion as to whether to cancel the visa, and exercised that discretion to do so.
The delegate's decision was affirmed by the Tribunal.
An application to the Federal Magistrates Court to set aside the decision of the Tribunal for jurisdictional error was dismissed on 8 February 2007.
3 I will not repeat the detailed background to the present appeal or the reasons for decision of the Tribunal or of the Federal Magistrate.
They set out in the reasons for decision referred to in [1].
I gave leave to the appellant to appeal out of time from the decision of the Federal Magistrate in the limited terms referred to because I considered that it was reasonably arguable by the appellant that the exercise of the discretion whether or not to cancel the visa involved jurisdictional error on the part of the Tribunal.
In the other respects upon which the appellant proposed to appeal, I did not think he had any prospect of establishing jurisdictional error.
The arguable grounds of jurisdictional error depended upon it being established that the Tribunal, in the exercise of its discretion, had not complied with Migration Series Instruction 368 (MSI 368), as in force at the relevant time.
