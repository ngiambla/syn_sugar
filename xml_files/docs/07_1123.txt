 THE PROCEEDING 
 
1 The applicants seek leave to appeal out of time from a judgment of the Federal Magistrates Court, which was adverse to them.
2 The first applicant is a citizen of the People's Republic of China.
He has claimed that he would face persecution because of his political profile and belief if he returned to China.
The second and third applicants are his wife and son.
Their claims are dependent on the outcome of his claims.
The first applicant arrived in Australia on or about 14 November 1996 with the second applicant.
The third applicant was born on 19 September 2003 in Melbourne.
3 Under cover of a letter dated 29 September 2005, the first applicant applied for a protection visa.
He claimed to have a well-founded fear of persecution because of his involvement in the pro-democracy movement in China.
The Minister's delegate refused his application on 25 November 2005.
On 23 December 2005, he applied to the Refugee Review Tribunal ('the Tribunal') for review and attended a Tribunal hearing on 16 February 2006.
4 In May 2006, the Tribunal affirmed the delegate's decision.
The Tribunal held that, given the passage of time, any involvement that the first applicant may have had in the pro-democracy movement was so remote that there was no real chance he would face persecution on returning to China.
The Tribunal did not accept that the first applicant sought to avoid the Chinese authorities on his return from Singapore in 1995, or that he was of adverse attention to the authorities when he left China in 1996.
The Tribunal found that the first applicant obtained a passport in his own name and legally departed China.
He had renewed his passport on a number of occasions, as recently as August 2005.
The Tribunal held that country information indicated that he would not have enjoyed this freedom of movement if he were of interest to the Chinese authorities.
