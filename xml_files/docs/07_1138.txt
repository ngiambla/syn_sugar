 
1 This is an application by way of appeal from a decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (the Tribunal) given on 30 May 2006.
2 The Tribunal determined that the applicant is liable to pay compensation to the respondent pursuant to the Seafarers Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1992 (Cth) (the Seafarers Act) in respect of an injury to the respondent's left knee in about June 2004.
BACKGROUND 
 
3 The respondent was born in 1955.
He has worked in the shipping industry since 1989, mostly as a steward.
Between 2001 and 2004, he worked for P  O Ports Ltd as a stevedore, which involved loading and unloading ships.
That work required the respondent to engage in some heavy lifting and frequent kneeling.
4 The respondent has some history of medical problems.
In 1985, he fractured his left tibia and dislocated his left ankle.
He recovered from this over a period of four months.
He told the Tribunal that it has not caused him problems since.
In 1990, he developed back pain while working as a steward.
He told the Tribunal those symptoms had persisted, and he gets sciatic pain down his left side.
In May 2002 he also had symptoms in his left knee when driving a truck with a heavy clutch, but the symptoms quickly resolved and (he said) he had no subsequent problems with his left knee prior to his employment with the applicant.
In 2003, the respondent experienced pain in his right knee, which he attributed to his work as a stevedore.
He was treated first by a physiotherapist and then by an orthopaedic surgeon, who performed an arthroscopy.
The respondent returned to work two months after that operation, in a co-ordinating role rather than returning to physical work.
5 The respondent undertook a trainee integrated rating (TIR) course in 2004.
6 He then commenced employment with the applicant, a shipping company that operates the ship vessel Iron Chieftain between Whyalla and Port Kembla.
He worked for a continuous period from 17 May 2004 to 20 July 2004.
During that time, he worked as a steward during the morning, essentially involving cleaning duties, and on TIR duties in the afternoon for about two hours.
The TIR duties involved various maintenance work on the ship, requiring him to work on each of the ship's six decks, using stairs or ladders to move between them.
He did that mix of duties for about two weeks without difficulty.
7 The respondent said that he developed pain in his right knee, which he controlled by taking anti-inflammatory medication (which he had taken with him to the ship) and by favouring that knee.
He then began to experience pain in his left knee.
He said it became progressively worse and made kneeling especially difficult.
He spoke to the bosun about this and as a result stopped doing tasks that involved kneeling but otherwise continued in his duties.
8 On 7 July 2004, he completed an employee notification form, in which he described his injury as: "Soreness stiffness and swelling in left knee.
Has become progressively worse over last few weeks.
Will be seeking medical advice during my leave.
" Subsequently, in response to specific questioning by a doctor, he recalled one incident when he missed his step and struck his left knee on some machinery; his leg was bruised but he did not think much of the incident at the time.
9 The respondent told the Tribunal that he continued in his duties after that time, but would use the lift on the ship whenever possible, rather than taking the stairs, because use of stairs and ladders also made his symptoms worse.
However, he would still use the stairs, on average about twelve times per day, sometimes because it was quicker and sometimes because one of the work areas (known as the tunnel) had no lift access.
10 When the respondent took leave later in July 2004, he received medical treatment on his left knee, culminating in an arthroscopy in August 2004.
11 The respondent made a formal claim for compensation for injury to his left and right knees under the Seafarers Act on 8 August 2004.
Subsequently, it appears that the respondent's left knee condition has been the cause of the claimed ongoing incapacity.
In his claim, he said:
 
 Noticed pain in right knee approx 2 wks after joining.
Began to favour that knee and then noticed pain in left knee after a while which became progressively worse.
Decided to report it to captain but was able to continue to carry out my duties by taking anti-inflammatory until end of swing [period of continuous work].
Duly sought medical advice when I got home.
Was referred to specialist.


In the claim form he said the injury was first noticed in the morning of 30 June 2004.
He attributed the injury to having to climb and descend stairs.
He said also that he had had a similar injury in 2003 whilst working for P  O Ports Ltd at Port Adelaide, for which he had received compensation.
12 The respondent did not work for about one year after the arthroscopy on his left knee.
He then worked as a cook on a dredge from October 2005 to December 2005.
13 The applicant rejected the claim.
Hence the Tribunal's review.
THE ISSUES BEFORE THE TRIBUNAL 
 
14 The Tribunal identified the issues it had to address as being:
 
 1. whether the symptoms in the left knee resulted from the incident when the respondent slipped whilst descending stairs and struck his left knee; and
 2. whether the symptoms in the left knee resulted from an aggravation of a pre-existing degenerative condition, and if so whether that aggravation was contributed to in a material degree by the respondent's employment with the applicant.


15 The applicant's case before the Tribunal was that the respondent had had symptoms in his left knee before he was employed by the applicant, and that he had subsequently dishonestly claimed compensation for symptoms which pre-dated his employment and were the consequence of a degenerative condition of his left knee.
That involved a direct attack upon the truthfulness of the respondent.
It also led the applicant to contend that the respondent's left knee injury was caused by serious and wilful misconduct.
The bases of that claim included that the applicant had allegedly made false statements in, or omitted information from, a pre-employment medical examination form (the medical form) which he provided to Dr Macris to secure a certificate of medical fitness; that the respondent should have been aware that he was not fully fit for work as a result of having to alter his duties following the arthroscopy of his right knee in 2003 yet he continued working; the non-disclosure of the fact that he had received physiotherapy treatment only shortly before commencing work on the Iron Chieftain; and the taking of anti-inflammatory medication at the beginning of the period of work on the Iron Chieftain.
It was put that the respondent knew he should not have undertaken that work.
It was also contended that, by continuing to work on the Iron Chieftain as he did after being aware of increasing pain in his knees, the respondent so disregarded his own safety as to be guilty of serious and wilful misconduct.
THE LEGISLATION 
 
16 Section 26(1) of the Seafarers Act creates an employee's entitlement to compensation for an 'injury' that results in incapacity for work or impairment, but under s 26(3) compensation is not payable if the "injury" is caused by the "serious and wilful misconduct of the employee" except in certain circumstances which do not presently apply.
17 'Injury' is relevantly defined in s 3 to mean:
 
 (a) a disease; or
 
 
 
 (b) an injury (other than a disease) suffered by an employee, being a physical or mental injury arising out of, or in the course of, the employee's employment; or 
 
 
 
 
 
 (c) an aggravation of a physical or mental injury (other than a disease) suffered by an employee (whether or not that injury arose out of, or in the course of, the employee's employment), being an aggravation that arose out of, or in the course of, that employment;
 
 

'Disease' is defined in s 3 to mean:
 
 (a) any ailment suffered by an employee; or 
 
 (b) the aggravation of any such ailment;
 

being an ailment or an aggravation that was contributed to in a material degree by the employee's employment.
18 In turn, the word "ailment" is defined relevantly to mean any physical disorder, defect or morbid condition (whether of sudden onset or gradual development) and the word "aggravation" is defined to include "acceleration or recurrence".
19 The issues raised on this appeal also require reference to some other provisions of the Seafarers Act.
20 Because the eligibility of the respondent to compensation is in issue, the definition of "employee" should be noted.
Section 4 relevantly defines an employee as "a seafarer" and s 3 relevantly defines a seafarer as a person employed in any capacity on a prescribed ship, on the business of the ship.
Section 6 makes it clear that a reference to an injury suffered by an employee is a reference to an injury suffered by the employee for which compensation is payable under the Seafarers Act.
21 There are also in s 10 particular provisions relating to diseases.
Section 10(3) provides for certain circumstances in which employment contributes in a material way to the aggravation of a disease (a concept entrenched in the definition of "disease").
It provides:
 
 For the purposes of this Act, if an employee suffers an aggravation of a disease, any employment in the maritime industry in which he or she was engaged at any time before symptoms of the aggravation first became apparent is taken, unless the contrary is established, to have contributed in a material degree to the aggravation if the incidence of the aggravation of the disease among people suffering from it who have engaged in such employment is significantly greater than it is among people suffering from the disease who have engaged in other employment.


Section 10(6) addresses the relationship between a disease, or its aggravation, and incapacity in the following terms:
 
 For the purposes of this Act, an incapacity for work, or an impairment, of an employee is taken to have resulted from a disease, or an aggravation of a disease, if, apart from that disease or aggravation, as the case may be:
 
 (a) the incapacity or impairment would not have occurred; or 
 
 
 (b) the incapacity would have started, or the impairment would have happened, at a significantly later time; or
 (c) the extent of the incapacity or impairment would have been significantly less.

 
 
 

Section 10(7) imposes a particular circumstance in which a disease or its aggravation will not amount to an injury.
It provides:
 
 For the purposes of this Act, a disease suffered by an employee, or an aggravation of such a disease, is not taken to be an injury to the employee if the employee has at any time, for purposes connected with his or her employment or proposed employment in the maritime industry, made a wilful and false representation that he or she did not suffer, or had not previously suffered, from that disease.


22 Finally, s 63 also apparently prescribes circumstances which must be met before compensation is payable under the Seafarers Act.
It relates to the making of a claim for compensation.
It relevantly provides:
 
 
 (1) Compensation is not payable to a person under this Act unless a claim for compensation is made by or on behalf of the person under this section.

 
 
 
 (2) A claim must be made by giving the employer:
 
 
 
 
 (a) a written claim, in accordance with a form approved by the Authority for the purposes of this paragraph; and 
 
 


 
 
 
 (b) ... a certificate by a legally qualified medical practitioner in accordance with the form approved by the Authority for the purposes of this paragraph; and
 
 (c) a notice setting out:
 
 
 

 (i) the name and address of any other employer who has been given, or to whom it is intended to give, a claim under paragraph (2)(a) in relation to the injury; and
 

 
 (ii) the name and address of any other employer whose employment is believed to have materially contributed to the injury.

 
 (3) If a written claim ... is given to a person under paragraph (2)(a) and the claim is not accompanied by a certificate of the kind referred to in paragraph (2)(b), the claim is taken not to have been made until such a certificate is given to that employer.
(4) Strict compliance with an approved form referred to in subsection (2) is not required and substantial compliance is sufficient.

 
 
 

The Authority referred to is the Seafarers Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Authority established under s 103 of the Seafarers Act, with the functions referred to in s 104.
THE TRIBUNAL DECISION 
 
23 The direct attack on the respondent's credibility did not succeed.
The Tribunal made certain findings based upon his evidence.
In particular, it accepted that the respondent did not have any symptoms in his left knee after the episode in 2002 whilst driving a truck until the pain in his left knee which developed during his employment on the Iron Chieftain.
It also found that the torn meniscus identified during the arthroscopy in August 2004 probably pre-existed his employment with the applicant and was not the cause of the left knee symptoms he developed in his employment with the applicant.
Then it concluded that, during the respondent's employment with the applicant, he suffered an aggravation of a pre-existing condition of his left knee which resulted in an incapacity for work.
It also found that the employment on the Iron Chieftain contributed in a material way to that incapacity, and that this resulted in incapacity for work and the incurring of medical expenses.
24 As to the claim that the respondent's injury arose from serious and wilful misconduct on his own part, and so was not compensable, the claim foundered on the factual findings of the Tribunal.
It said there was no basis for the respondent to have been aware that his duties during his employment on the Iron Chieftain would cause the injury to, or disability in, his left knee, which it had found was the compensable injury producing incapacity for work.
And it also found that there was no causative link between the conduct which the applicant alleged amounted to serious and wilful misconduct and the compensable injury.
In relation to that finding, the Tribunal observed that there was no evidence that Dr Macris would not have issued the medical form if the respondent had fully disclosed his medical history, or that the applicant would not have employed him if it had known in particular of the medical history concerning his right knee condition.
And it specifically found that, even if the matters relied on by the applicant amounted to serious and wilful misconduct, that conduct did not cause the symptoms in the left knee which led to the respondent's incapacity for work.
The Tribunal also found that both captains of the Iron Chieftain were, or should have been, aware that the respondent was having knee problems at work but that they nevertheless, in effect, expected the respondent to continue with his duties.
25 The Tribunal therefore set aside the decision under review, and substituted a decision that the applicant is liable to pay compensation to the respondent under the Seafarers Act for the injury to his left knee.
The matter was remitted to the applicant to determine the amount of the compensation in accordance with the Tribunal's reasons.
26 By a separate decision given on 4 July 2006, the Tribunal ordered the applicant to pay the costs of the respondent of the proceedings, save in respect of one issue.
CONTENTIONS ON APPEAL 
 
27 The grounds of appeal, as set out in the notice of appeal filed on 27 June 2006 were refined by the written submissions and the submissions at the hearing.
There were six matters which, the applicant contended, involved errors of law by the Tribunal.
The applicant said that any one of those matters, if made out, would result in the appeal being allowed and the initial decision that the respondent was not entitled to compensation under the Seafarers Act being restored.
Those matters were:
 
 (1) That the respondent was not a "seafarer" as defined in s 3 of the Seafarers Act, and so was not an "employee" as defined and so was not eligible to receive compensation under the Seafarers Act in respect of his alleged injury.
(2) That the respondent did not make a claim for compensation under s 63 of the Seafarers Act in respect of the injury which the Tribunal found he had suffered, so that compensation was not payable under the Seafarers Act in respect of that injury.
(3) That the respondent did not suffer any aggravation of the pre-existing degenerative condition of his left knee, resulting in incapacity for work, but merely a temporary experiencing of pain evidencing, but not aggravating, that degenerative condition which does not entitle him to compensation under the Seafarers Act.
(4) That, in any event, the alleged aggravation of the pre-existing degenerative condition of the respondent's left knee produced pain, but no change in the underlying pathology, and the pain itself did not produce any ongoing incapacity for work, so there was no entitlement to compensation for incapacity in respect of it.
(5) That s 10(7) of the Seafarers Act applied in the circumstances, namely that the respondent had made a wilful and false representation that he did not suffer or had not previously suffered from the disease for which he claimed compensation, so his injury was not compensable.
(6) That s 26(3) of the Seafarers Act applied to disentitle the respondent from receiving compensation because his injury was caused by serious and wilful misconduct on his part.


The Tribunal, so the applicant submitted, had erred in law in deciding each of those matters adversely to the applicant.
28 The respondent contended that the applicant had not raised before the Tribunal the issues numbered (1), (2), (3) and (5) above and had limited its opposition to the respondent's claim to the attack upon the respondent's credibility, and that it only sought findings that the respondent had pre-existing degeneration in both his knees and any worsening of symptoms in his left knee was caused by his serious and wilful misconduct.
29 The application by way of appeal is limited to questions of law.
Section 44(7) of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth) permits the Court to make findings of fact in certain circumstances, where such findings are not inconsistent with those made by the Tribunal and where an error of law on the part of the Tribunal has been made out, so as to finally resolve a proceeding expeditiously.
The applicant on this appeal did not clothe its contentions with s 44(7).
30 It is clear from the Tribunal's reasons, and the written submissions of the applicant to the Tribunal, that the applicant did not raise before the Tribunal the issues identified in (1), (2) and (5) above, and probably also did not raise the issue raised in (3) above.
There is no reference to those contentions in the Tribunal's reasons, and in particular ss 10(7) and 63 also were not referred to.
31 The applicant justifies the raising of those issues for the first time on appeal on the basis of an asserted obligation of the Tribunal to inquire into and correctly consider questions of law arising on the matter before it, even in the face of concessions or admissions by the parties.
It relies upon Comcare v Fiedler [2001] FCA 1810 ; (2001) 115 FCR 328 at [36] --- [39] for that proposition.
32 I do not consider that that decision supports its contention.
That case relevantly concerned the question of whether the Tribunal had erred in failing to address the question under s 24(2)(c) of the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988 (Cth) of whether the employee claiming compensation had undertaken all reasonable rehabilitative treatment for the impairment which was compensable.
That consideration was relevant to whether the injury had resulted in permanent impairment, so as to entitle the employee concerned to a lump sum compensation payment.
The Full Court (Drummond, Kiefel and Dowsett JJ) at [39] said:
 
 The Tribunal is not, as a general rule, required to ignore the fact that one or both parties have made admissions or concessions, express or implied, that particular issues which the original decision-maker may have had to consider need not be the subject of inquiry and determination by the Tribunal.
The Tribunal will, however, fall into error of law by failing to inquire of its own motion into, and make a finding on, an issue the subject of an admission or concession by a party that is material to its decision if there is reason to doubt that the admission or concession is factually justified.
But in the absence of there being some reason to question the admission or concession, the Tribunal will generally be entitled not to inquire into the issue for itself, but to act on that admission or concession in making its decision.


33 In my judgment, the conduct of the matter before the Tribunal clearly indicates that, at least impliedly, the applicant did not seek to ventilate the issues arising under ss 10(7) or 63 of the Act, and restricted itself to the matters which the Tribunal identified.
The Tribunal in those circumstances was quite entitled to proceed upon the basis that those matters were not contentious.
It did not err in failing to address them.
Consequently, the applicant is not now entitled to assert or cannot succeed in asserting that the Tribunal erred in law by failing to do so.
34 In addition, there are a few matters in respect of which it is not at all clear that, had the issues been raised by the applicant for consideration, the evidence would have remained as it was before the Tribunal.
As discussed in more detail below, in the course of considering the several matters raised by the applicant, the matters now raised under (1), (2) and (5) above and possibly in (3) above may have led to there being more evidence before the Tribunal pertaining to them.
For example, there may have been evidence from Dr Macris as to the significance, if any, of the additional medical history to him issuing the CMF to the respondent.
There may have been evidence from Dr Bauze and Dr Brooks, and perhaps other evidence, as to the relationship between the diseased condition of the respondent's right knee and the aggravation of the diseased condition of his left knee.
There may have been further evidence from the applicant about his state of mind at the time he was examined by Dr Macris concerning his capacity to do the proposed work on the Iron Chieftain.
There may have been other relevant communications between the applicant and the respondent, or between the applicant and others such as medical practitioners.
That is not of course intended to be exhaustive, or necessarily correct.
It is really speculative as to how the hearing before the Tribunal would have proceeded if those issues had been properly signalled.
Such considerations, however, do indicate that it would not be appropriate now to permit those matters to be raised: see.
eg.
Coulton v Holcombe [1986] HCA 33 ; (1986) 162 CLR 1 at 7-8; University of Wollongong v Metwally (No 2) [1985] HCA 28 ; (1985) 59 ALJR 481 at 483.
I shall nevertheless consider each of the matters sought to be raised by the applicant, even though in some instances the material available may not be the full material which would have been available had the applicant raised those issues before the Tribunal.
Whether the respondent was a "seafarer" under s 3 of the Seafarers Act 
 
35 The applicant accepted that the respondent was employed by it to work at sea, but submitted that the Tribunal was obliged to address, and did not address, the question whether the respondent was a "seafarer" as defined in s 3 of the Seafarers Act.
It submitted that the respondent was not lawfully employed as a seafarer, and therefore was not entitled to compensation under the Seafarers Act.
That is because, so the argument ran, he did not have a valid certificate of medical fitness (CMF) under Pt 9 of the Marine Orders (Health --- Medical Fitness) (the Marine Orders) made under s 425(1AA) of the Navigation Act 1912 (Cth) (the Navigation Act ), as in force at the material time.
36 The applicant contends, based upon the findings of the Tribunal (made in relation to the issue as to whether the respondent had engaged in serious and wilful misconduct) and upon the respondent's own evidence, that the respondent's CMF was procured by the respondent misleading the examining doctor who issued the CMF about his fitness for work and his existing medical condition, and in doing so committed an offence under s 389 of the Navigation Act .
Section 389 of that Act makes it an offence to make a false declaration, false statement or false representation in connection with an application or a proceeding under that Act.
37 Clauses 5.1 and 6.1 of the Marine Orders provide:
 
 
 5.1 A person must not perform duties as a seafarer, or be taken into employment to perform duties as a seafarer, on a ship to which section 124 of the Navigation Act applies unless that person is medically fit to perform those duties.

 
 
 
 ...
 
 6.1 A person is medically fit for the purposes of 5.1 or 5.2 if that person:
 
 (a) has a valid Certificate of Medical Fitness; and
 
 
 
 
 (b) there is no evidence that his or her medical condition has altered since the previous medical examination to an extent that would make him or her unfit for the duties to be performed.

 
 
 
 

38 Clause 7 deals with the issue of a CMF.
It is issued by a Medical Inspector of Seamen (MIS), after appropriate inquiries, if the MIS is able to attest to the true state of the health of the person seeking a CMF and can determine that that person is medically fit to perform the proposed duties: see cl 7.4.1.
The CMF is to be in the specified form.
Clause 7.3.1 requires an MIS to have regard to "Guidelines for the medical examination of seafarers and coastal pilots" in Appendix 2 to the Marine Orders.
39 A CMF was issued to the respondent on 17 January 2004.
40 The material before the Tribunal indicates that the MIS may have relied in part on a questionnaire about the respondent's medical history.
