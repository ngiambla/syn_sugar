 
1 This proceeding concerns a 2200 watt bagless vacuum cleaner manufactured in China.
The parties are both Australian importers and wholesalers of electrical appliances.
The applicant was the first to import the vacuum cleaner from China, and secured design registration under the Designs Act 2003 (Cth) ("the Designs Act ") in relation to the product.
It also claims to have a contract with the Chinese manufacturer for the exclusive distribution rights for the product in Australia.
But the Chinese manufacturer has also supplied the respondent with large quantities of the same vacuum cleaner, knowing that the respondent's purpose was their wholesale distribution in Australia.
Within this broad context, the case raises issues of the validity of the applicant's registered design, whether a letter of demand sent on behalf of the applicant constituted an unjustified threat of design infringement, whether the respondent induced the manufacturer to breach a contract which it had with the applicant, and associated questions to which I shall turn in due course.
BACKGROUND 
 
2 The applicant, World of Technologies (Aust) Pty Ltd, is an importer and wholesaler of household goods and electrical appliances, including vacuum cleaners.
Many of these goods are sourced from China and are sold by wholesale in Australia under the applicant's brand "Genius".
Although the applicant imports only seven products, it lists many more --- possibly up to about 100 it would seem --- on its web site on the basis that it would be able to obtain those products should a retailer show an interest in them.
The applicant does not import goods in the hope or expectation of finding an Australian buyer for them.
Rather, its modus operandi is to secure firm orders for particular goods from Australian retailers, and then to fill those orders by ordering the goods in question from the overseas supplier.
If the arrangements made by the applicant as disclosed in the evidence in the present case are typical, the applicant needs first to identify a product from an overseas source, then to reach some kind of understanding with the supplier about price and other commercial details, and finally to procure a retailer in Australia to place orders for the product.
The orders are filled, it seems, by the overseas supplier sending the goods direct to the retailer.
Physically, the goods do not pass through the custody of the applicant.
Neither does the applicant carry the risk of unsold goods in the Australian market.
3 Mr Peter Jabbour describes himself as the managing director of the applicant, although he is not a director.
The only director and shareholder of the applicant is Mr Jabbour's wife who, according to Mr Jabbour, stays at home and is not involved in the business much.
Mr Jabbour is manifestly the directing mind and will of the applicant --- in his words, he is "looking after the company".
He was the only representative of the applicant who gave evidence.
4 Neither Mr Jabbour nor his daughter (Tania Varela, who works for the applicant) speaks Chinese.
For this reason, and also because of the particular way the Chinese do business, and the importance of establishing a relationship of trust with the Chinese, the applicant uses the services of an agent based in Singapore, Mr Giyoke Tseng, who is fluent in Chinese and English.
Mr Tseng's role, it seems, is (or at least includes) making contact with Chinese suppliers and functioning as the applicant's representative in the establishment of the terms upon which it would do business with those suppliers.
5 The respondent, Tempo (Aust) Pty Ltd, is an importer and wholesaler of household consumer items, including vacuum cleaners.
Mr Nicholas Stergiotis is its sole director and shareholder.
The business conducted by the respondent was originally conducted (by another company) under the name "Onix".
That business appears to operate along similar lines to those of the applicant's business.
Like the applicant, the respondent sources household goods from overseas suppliers and, if what is disclosed by the evidence is typical, places orders with those suppliers only upon receipt of an order from an Australian retailer.
Also like the applicant, the respondent conducts its business through agents or representatives in Asia.
Its arrangements in that regard appear to be a little more developed than those of the applicant.
Mr Stergiotis is also the sole director and shareholder of Global Asia Pacific (HK) Ltd ("GAP"), a company based in Hong Kong.
When the respondent sources products from China, it does so through GAP.
When such products are sourced from Shanghai or northern China (such as Suzhou), GAP in turn engages an agent to deal with the Chinese factory.
The agent concerned in the transactions which became relevant in the present case was Cuori International (HK) Co Ltd ("Cuori").
6 On the retail side, for the purposes of this case it will be sufficient to note that there are two categories of major retailers which have an involvement in vacuum cleaners.
The first is made up of stores which specialise in the product and carry a wide range of different makes and models.
The retailer in this category which was the subject of particular attention in this case is Electrical Home Aids Pty Ltd, which trades as "Godfreys" in New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia, Western Australia and the mainland Territories (but not in Victoria and Tasmania, where an unrelated company trades as "Godfreys", also in the retailing of vacuum cleaners).
I shall refer to Electrical Home Aids Pty Ltd as "Godfreys".
7 The second category of retailers is made up of large variety chain stores which sell many different products of which vacuum cleaners are only one.
They tend to select particular vacuum cleaners for sale as promotional items from time to time.
They do not stock a range of different models.
They include retailers such as Woolworths, Homeart, The Warehouse, Go-Lo, Crazy Clarks, K-Mart and Target.
8 It seems that bagless vacuum cleaners appeared on the Australian homewares retail scene about five years ago.
It is said that they have certain advantages over cleaners of the traditional design which use a bag for dust collection.
There are about 50 different bagless vacuum cleaners presently being offered at retail in Australia.
The competition is intense, particularly since manufacturers in China have commenced to supply the market.
I gather from the tenor of the evidence that the principal characteristics of a particular vacuum cleaner which are thought to be attractive to the consumer are power, appearance and price.
Specifically, it is common ground that, other things being equal, a consumer would almost inevitably prefer a higher-powered model over a lower-powered model.
At about the end of 2004, there was no vacuum cleaner on the market with a power of 2200W or greater.
FACTS GIVING RISE TO THE PRESENT DISPUTE 
 
9 On 14 December 2004, Mr Tseng received an email from the General Manager of Suzhou Fak Electric Co Ltd ("Suzhou Fak"), a company based in Suzhou, China.
He sought to interest Mr Tseng in a new cyclonic bagless vacuum cleaner manufactured by Suzhou Fak, which had the model designation MC-801.
On the same day, Mr Tseng replied by email in which he said that the new model looked "not bad", and that he had a customer in Australia who bought lots of vacuum cleaners.
However, he stipulated a number of conditions which would have to apply if his customer were to take the MC-801: a very attractive price, very good quality, very good performance and "exclusive distribution support to succeed".
He said, in effect, that these conditions were necessary because of the competitive nature of the market.
10 On 16 December 2004, Mr Tseng received an email from the owner of Suzhou Fak, Mr Terry Ding.
His response to Mr Tseng's conditions was encouraging.
In relation to the requirement of exclusive distribution, Mr Ding mentioned another company of which he had been the marketing manager, and added "your success means my achievement".
Mr Tseng replied the same day, indicating that he would introduce the MC-801 to his "Australia / New Zealand customer".
He said that, if they were going to proceed, they would have to do so immediately.
11 On 20 December 2004, Mr Tseng sent an email to Mr Jabbour, in which he said that he had a friend who had recently set up his own vacuum cleaner factory, and that their first model was a very powerful one, the MC-801.
Mr Tseng said that he would contact Mr Jabbour later to explain further, and "if OK, I will go back to discuss further detail with them to get exclusive to secure our effort so that we can add this new model into our 2005 new product line".
12 On 24 December 2004, Mr Tseng sent Mr Jabbour a further email, which was tendered by the respondent.
It read:
 
 Regarding the New Bagless Vacuum Cleaner MC-801 that I discussed with you few days ago, I had a talk with the boss of the supplier regarding the Exclusive Distribution matter, I introduced our background, our potential as few of the top importer in Vacuum Cleaner and small home appliance and the business way we are doing, our sales channel etc., as my friend had introduced us to the boss earlier already and therefore basically they are willing to Authorize us as their Exclusive Distributor of this MC-801 in Australia and New Zealand market.
But because as said earlier, it is their new and first product, in the meantime they have confidence that many customers will definitely like and willing to distribute this model but in the meantime they also hope to move and confirm asap and therefore they would like to keep us as first priority to decide whether and when we will start moving this model then can authorize the Exclusive Certificate to us and let us apply the design registration.
Which means they said in case our buyer has no interest to go with this model, then they will sell to other Australia company.
Therefore they want us to confirm more further asap and let them know whether we want it or not seriously, if we want it, then they can sign the Exclusive to us.
Could you please evaluate serious first and let me know your thought and decision, if positive to go, I will then go to discuss with them again to settle this matter.


13 In late December 2004, Mr Tseng sent Mr Jabbour a statement of the technical specifications for the MC-801.
Mr Jabbour thought that Godfreys would be interested in the product.
He sent a copy of the specifications to the Managing Director of Godfreys, Mr John Hardy.
In discussions about the proposal with Mr Jabbour, Mr Hardy said that he would consider stocking and promoting the vacuum cleaner only if the applicant guaranteed "exclusivity", that is to say, promised a situation in which Godfreys would be the only retailer stocking the product.
If that were done, Mr Hardy said that he would place an initial order for at least 5,000 units, and thereafter place orders according to demand.
He asked Mr Jabbour for samples for testing, and for development of the artwork (for the outside of the box in which the product would be sold).
14 On about 5 January 2005, Mr Jabbour telephoned Mr Tseng and told him that the applicant would be interested in importing the vacuum cleaner, providing that Suzhou Fak could guarantee exclusive supply into Australia.
On 7 January 2005, Mr Tseng emailed Mr Jabbour in the following terms.

 Regarding the MC-801, after long and closer discussion with the supplier, they finally agreed to authorize us as their Exclusive Distributor in Australia and New Zealand, but of course they sincerely hope we could do our best to promote the product asap and to show our potential to reach the best sales we can, it is a kind of trust mutually.


15 On 10 January 2005, Mr Tseng sent Mr Jabbour an electronic copy of a document produced by Suzhou Fak, and headed with the name, address and telephone and facsimile numbers of that company.
The content of the document was as follows:
