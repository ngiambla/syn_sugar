 
1 Before me is an application made under s 476A Migration Act 1958 (Cth) ("the Act ") wherein the applicant seeks an order in the nature of Certiorari quashing the decision of the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship ("Minister") dated 20 February 2007 to cancel the applicant's Resident Return Subclass 155 visa.
Grounds of application 
 
2 The application filed 24 April 2007 was based on two grounds:
 
 
 1.
The Minister erred in exercising his discretion to cancel the visa under s 501(2) of the Act by not properly taking into account a relevant consideration, namely the expectations of the Australian community because: 
 
 
 (a) the Minister did not consider the positive contribution of [the applicant] to the community; and
 9b) the Minister instead reconsidered the issue of community protection based on the nature of the criminal offences.

 
 
 2.
The Minister erred in exercising his discretion to cancel the visa under s 501(2) of the Act by not properly taking into a relevant consideration, namely the best interests of the children.
He concluded that [the applicant's] four children under 18 all live with their mothers and that the removal of that contact would cause some hardship.
The Minister did not take into account that [the applicant's] youngest son Joshua lives with him and that [the applicant's] removal would have a much greater effect on Joshua.

 
 
 

3 At the commencement of the hearing on 23 July 2007, Mr Duncan on behalf of the applicant informed the Court that the applicant no longer sought to press the first ground of the application, and sought leave to amend the grounds of the application, to be confined as follows:
 
 The Minister erred in exercising his discretion to cancel the visa under s 501(2) of the Migration Act 1958 by not properly taking into account a relevant consideration, namely the best interests of the children.
He concluded that [the applicant's] four children under 18 all live with their mothers and [the applicant] has access to them under a court order.
There is no evidence before the Minister to support that conclusion with respect to [the applicant's] children Joshua and Larni.


4 Notwithstanding the late stage at which the applicant sought to amend his application and the opposition of Ms Wheatley for the Minister, I permitted the amendment to the application.
I noted that the new ground was in substantially similar terms to the second of the applicant's previous grounds of application with the modification that the substituted ground of application contained reference to the applicant's daughter Larni whereas previously it did not; I accepted Mr Duncan's submission that new ground of appeal was substantially covered in the applicant's original outline delivered to the Minister and that the Minister had addressed those issues in response to the applicant's outline; and I noted Mr Duncan's submission that notice of the proposed amendment had been given to the respondent in the week prior to the hearing.
Accordingly, in my view there was no prejudice to the Minister in this matter, and indeed Ms Wheatley subsequently conceded at the hearing that she could point to no prejudice.
5 The result of this amendment to the application is that the issues for consideration by the Court have substantially narrowed.
Background 
 
6 The applicant first entered Australia from Tonga on 5 January 1974 aged 21 and was granted permanent residence on arrival.
I understand that he has lived predominantly in Australia during the intervening time.
7 The applicant was given a "Notice of Intention to Consider Cancelling a Visa under Subsection 501(2) Migration Act 1958 " ("Notice") dated 19 September 2006 by the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs ("Department").
The Notice specified s 501(2) and s 501(6)(a) as containing the particular grounds on which his visa was liable to cancellation.
The applicant was invited to respond to the Notice and did so, as did his family and friends.
Responses were received by the Department between 29 September and 12 October 2006, and included information concerning the applicant's four children under the age of 18, Larni, Nikita, Darryl and Joshua.
8 The Department prepared a paper summarising the relevant details ("the Issues Paper") for consideration by the Minister, which was received in the Minister's office on 16 February 2007.
The Minister decided to cancel the applicant's visa on 20 February 2007 and set out his reasons in a document ("Statement of Reasons").
The applicant was notified of the Minister's decision on 18 April 2007.
Relevant legislation 
 
9 The decision of the Minister to personally cancel the visa of the applicant was made pursuant to s 501(2) of the Act .
Section 501(2) provides:
 
 The Minister may cancel a visa that has been granted to a person if: 
 
 (a) the Minister reasonably suspects that the person does not pass the character test; and
 (b) the person does not satisfy the Minister that the person passes the character test.

 
 

10 It is not in dispute that the Minister's decision is a privative clause decision within the meaning of s 474(2) , or at least a purported privative clause decision within the meaning of s 5E.
The Federal Court therefore has original jurisdiction in relation to this decision in accordance with s 476A of the Act .
However, the jurisdiction of the Court is limited to the same as the jurisdiction of the High Court under para 75(v) of the Constitution (s 476A(2)).
Accordingly, in this case the Court can only set aside the Minister's decision for jurisdictional error: Plaintiff S157/2002 v Commonwealth of Australia [2003] HCA 2 ; (2003) 211 CLR 476 at 506-508 and 511 per Gaudron, McHugh, Gummow, Kirby and Hayne JJ; Tuncok v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 172 at [8] .
An error of fact which may have been made by the Minister is not reviewable by this Court unless it relates to a jurisdictional fact or is a manifestation of some error of law, substantive or procedural, which constitutes jurisdictional error and thereby vitiates the purported decision: Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Yusuf [2001] HCA 30 ; (2001) 206 CLR 323 at 351-352 per McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ; NABE v Minister for Immigration and Indigenous Affairs (No 2) [2004] FCAFC 263 at [53] .
The Minister's decision 
 
11 It is not in dispute that, in making his decision, the Minister was bound to take into account as a primary consideration the best interests of the children of the applicant under the age of 18.
Failure to do so as a primary consideration would result in the decision of the Minister being affected by jurisdictional error: Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v Lorenzo [2005] FCAFC 13 at [57] - [58] .
12 Guidance for decision-makers in making decisions to refuse or cancel a visa under s 501(2) is found in the Minister's "Direction under section 499 - Visa Refusal and Cancellation under section 501 of the Migration Act - No 21" ("Direction No 21").
Although not binding on the Minister himself, the Minister indicated at para 5 of the Statement of Reasons that he had followed his usual practice and proceeded in accordance with Direction No 21.
It is not in dispute that it is relevant for the Minister to have regard to the contents of Direction No 21 in making his decision.
13 Paragraph 2.3 of Direction No 21 states the primary considerations for the decision-maker in respect of a decision to refuse or cancel a visa:
 
 "2.3 In making a decision whether to refuse or cancel a visa, there are three primary considerations: 
 
 (a) the protection of the Australian community, and members of the community;
 (b) the expectations of the Australian community; and
 (c) in all cases involving a parental or other close relationship between a child or children and the person under consideration, the best interests of the child or children.
" 
 
 

14 Paragraphs 2.13-2.16 of Direction No 21 contain further guidance with respect to the best interests of the child, as follows:
 
 2.13 This consideration only applies if the child is or would be less than 18 years of age at the time when the decision is intended to come into effect.
The best interests of any children aged 18 years or more is not a primary consideration but may be considered with other considerations under paragraph 2.17.
2.14 Where there are two or more relevant children, it should not be assumed that the interests of each child will coincide, and it may be that the best interests of one child may indicate the non-citizen parent should not be refused a visa or removed from Australia, but that the best interests of another child may point towards visa refusal or cancellation.
2.15 In general terms, the child's best interest will be served if the child remains with its parents.
Countervailing considerations, which may point to the child's best interests being served by separation from the non-citizen, include, but are not limited to: 
 
 
 (a) any evidence that the non-citizen has abused or neglected the child in any way, including physical, sexual and/or mental abuse or neglect; or
 (b) any evidence that the child has suffered or experienced any physical or emotional trauma arising from the non-citizen's conduct.

 
 
 2.16 When considering the best interests of the child, decision-makers should have regard to the following: 
 
 
 (a) the nature of the relationship between the child and the non-citizen;
 (b) the duration of the relationship including the number and length of any separations and reason/s for the separation; the hypothetical prospect for developing a better/stronger relationship in future (whether or not there has been significant recent contact) would normally be given relatively less weight than the proven history of the relationship based on past conduct;
 (c) the age of the child;
 (d) whether the child is an Australian citizen or permanent resident;
 (e) the likely effect that any separation from the non-citizen would have on the child;
 (f) the impact of the non-citizen's prior conduct on the child;
 (g) the time (if any) that the child has spent in Australia;
 (h) the circumstances of the probable receiving country, including the educational facilities and the standard of the health support system of the country to which the child may have to go, or return to, should the non-citizen not be permitted to enter or remain in Australia;
 (i) any language barriers for the child in the probable country of future residence, but taking into account the relative ease with which younger children acquire new languages; and
 (j) any cultural barriers for the child in the probable country of future residence, but taking into account the relative ease with which younger children adapt to new circumstances.

 

15 In relation to the best interests of the children, the Minister in the Statement of Reasons said as follows:
 
 "22.
I also gave primary consideration to the best interests of the children.
Mr HOLANI has four children aged under eighteen years, currently residing in Australia with their mothers.
I noted Mr HOLANI's claims that he has regular contact with his children and the testimonies from family and friends supporting his claims to be a caring and supportive parent and that he has a court order allowing him access to them at least four days per fortnight.
I further noted that Mr HOLANI's son, Darryl Lewis Holani, has autism and that Mr Holani is committed to providing him with care and financial support to attend a special school.
23.
On balance, I found that Mr Holani's children would suffer some hardship if Mr HOLANI's visa were cancelled.
I accepted that the best interests of the children would be met by having both parents available to them during their upbringing and that the best environment for this would be in Australia.
I gave this consideration substantial weight.
