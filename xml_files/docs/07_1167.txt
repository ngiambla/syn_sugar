 THE APPLICATION 
 
1 On 21 April 2006 the applicant applied to this Court for a Native Title determination (the "Application").
Although the applicant is comprised of a group of persons, I will refer to them collectively as the "applicant", reflecting the usage adopted in the Native Title Act 1993 (Cth) (the "Act").
Pursuant to s 63 of the Act, the Registrar gave a copy of the Application and supporting material to the Native Title Registrar (the "NT Registrar").
A delegate of the NT Registrar (the "Delegate") then considered the Application in accordance with s 190A of the Act but decided not to accept it for registration in the Native Title Register (the "Register").
Pursuant to s 190D(1) the NT Registrar notified the applicant accordingly.
The applicant now seeks review of that decision pursuant to subs 190D(2) of the Act.
REGISTRATION 
 
2 An application for a Native Title determination is made pursuant to s 61 of the Act.
Sections 61 , 61A and 62 prescribe the content and form of a valid application.
However compliance with those requirements is not necessarily sufficient to secure registration of the claim.
Registration is regulated by Pt 7 of the Act.
The effect of registration is that, in advance of any determination as to the existence of Native Title, the applicant is entitled to participate in negotiations concerning proposed development affecting the relevant land.
Thus the effect of the Delegate's decision is that parties proposing development upon the land included in the application will not be compelled to negotiate with the applicant.
A claim may be accepted for registration only if the NT Registrar (or a delegate) is satisfied as to the conditions prescribed by ss 190B and 190C of the Act.
For present purposes the requirements of subss 190B(3), (5), (6) and (7) are relevant.
Those subsections provide as follows:
 
 '(3) The Registrar must be satisfied that: 
 
 
 
 (a) the persons in the native title claim group are named in the application; or 
 (b) the persons in that group are described sufficiently clearly so that it can be ascertained whether any particular person is in that group.

 
 
 
 
 ... 
 
 (4) ... 
 
 (5) The Registrar must be satisfied that the factual basis on which it is asserted that the native title rights and interests claimed exist is sufficient to support the assertion.
In particular, the factual basis must support the following assertions: 
 
 
 
 
 (a) that the native title claim group have, and the predecessors of those persons had, an association with the area; and 
 (b) that there exist traditional laws acknowledged by, and traditional customs observed by, the native title claim group that give rise to the claim to native title rights and interests; and 
 (c) that the native title claim group have continued to hold the native title in accordance with those traditional laws and customs.

 
 
 
 
 ... 
 
 (6) The Registrar must consider that, prima facie, at least some of the native title rights and interests claimed in the application can be established.

 ... 
 
 (7) The Registrar must be satisfied that at least one member of the native title claim group: 
 
 
 
 
 (a) currently has or previously had a traditional physical connection with any part of the land or waters covered by the application; or 
 (b) previously had and would reasonably have been expected currently to have a traditional physical connection with any part of the land or waters but for things done (other than the creation of an interest in relation to land or waters) by: 
 
 
 
 (i) the Crown in any capacity; or 
 (ii) a statutory authority of the Crown in any capacity; or 
 (iii) any holder of a lease over any of the land or waters, or any person acting on behalf of such a holder of a lease.
' 
 

3 The Delegate was not satisfied that the Application complied with those requirements.
He gave detailed reasons for his conclusions to which I will refer at a later stage.
4 Pursuant to subss 190A(3) and (4):
 
 
 '(3) In considering a claim under this section, the Registrar must have regard to: 
 
 
 
 
 (a) information contained in the application and in any other documents provided by the applicant; and 
 (b) any information obtained by the Registrar as a result of any searches conducted by the Registrar of registers of interests in relation to land or waters maintained by the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory; and 
 (c) to the extent that it is reasonably practicable to do so in the circumstances--any information supplied by the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory, that, in the Registrar's opinion, is relevant to whether any one or more of the conditions set out in section 190B or 190C are satisfied in relation to the claim; 
 
 
 
 
 and may have regard to such other information as he or she considers appropriate.

 
 ... 
 
 (4) Without limiting subsection (3), information mentioned in that subsection may include information about current or previous non-native title rights and interests in, or in relation to, the land or waters in the area covered by the application.
' 
 
 

5 The applicant's original criticisms of the Delegate's decision were that:
 
 
 '1.
The [applicant] (was) misled by documents, and information received from the [NT Registrar and Delegate] and acted in reliance on those documents to (its) detriment; 
 
 2.
The information and other material available to the [NT Registrar and Delegate] did not justify the application failing the 'registration test'; 
 
 3.
The [NT Registrar and Delegate] took into account irrelevant material; 
 
 4.
The [NT Registrar and Delegate] failed to take into account relevant material; 
 
 5.
The decision involved an error of law.
' 
 
 

6 At a relatively late stage, the applicant also alleged that it had been deprived of procedural fairness in the decision-making process.
THE APPLICANT WAS MISLED 
 
7 To understand the first criticism it is necessary to understand that there was, and is, a related application for Native Title determination (the "Core Country claim") which was filed on 22 March 2005 and accepted for registration on 22 April 2005, apparently after examination by the same Delegate.
That application is by the same applicant group and is in substantially the same terms as the present claim, save that it relates to a different area.
That area lies within defined boundaries, but certain discrete areas within those boundaries have been excised from it.
I understand that it was thought that Native Title over the excised areas may have been extinguished.
This Application relates to those areas.
The applicant submits: 
 
 '... that the fact that the same group of people, authorising the same individuals as applicant, enjoying the same rights and interests under the same traditional laws and customs within the same geographical boundary described in a manner which had passed the test meant they were entitled to rely on the reasons given by the [Delegate] in [the Core Country claim] when drafting the contents of [the Application] for the purposes of passing the registration test.
Further given these particular circumstances and that the Delegate of the Registrar who decided to ... register [the Core Country claim] ... was in fact the same person who later refused to register [the Application] it is submitted that on making the first decision that Delegate became functus officio in respect of the second decision and it was not open to him to in effect reverse his own earlier decision.
' 
 

8 These arguments are misconceived.
Firstly, if the NT Registrar or the Delegate were "functus officio" he or she could not have considered the Application at all.
Of course there was a statutory duty to do so.
Secondly, these submissions fail to take account of that statutory duty.
The Delegate was obliged to act in accordance with law, not in accordance with his own previous decision.
In Attorney-General (New South Wales) v Quin [1990] HCA 21 ; (1989-1990) 170 CLR 1 at 17-19, Mason CJ said:
 
 'I am unable to perceive how a representation made or an impression created by the Executive can preclude the Crown or the Executive from adopting a new policy, or acting in accordance with such a policy, in relation to the appointment of magistrates, so long as the new policy is one that falls within the ambit of the relevant duty or discretion, as in this case the new policy unquestionably does.
The Executive cannot by representation or promise disable itself from, or hinder itself in, performing a statutory duty or exercising a statutory discretion to be performed or exercised in the public interest, by binding itself not to perform the duty or exercise the discretion in a particular way in advance of the actual performance of the duty or exercise of the power.
...
Accordingly, it has been said that "a public authority ... cannot be estopped from doing its public duty", ...
.
' 
 

9 At 35, Brennan J said:
 
 'The question can be put quite starkly: when an administrative power is conferred by the legislature on the executive and its lawful exercise is apt to disappoint the expectations of an individual, what is the jurisdiction of the courts to protect that individual's legitimate expectations against adverse exercise of the power?
I have no doubt that the answer is: none.
Judicial review provides no remedies to protect interests, falling short of enforceable rights, which are apt to be affected by the lawful exercise of executive or administrative power.
If it were otherwise, the courts would be asserting a jurisdiction, in protection of individual interests, to override the law by which a power to affect those interests is conferred on the repository.
' 
 

10 The third member of the majority (Dawson J) said at 56:
 
 'Nevertheless, recent cases do speak of a legitimate expectation of a particular procedure giving rise to a duty in law to accord that procedure.
A good illustration is Attorney-General (Hong Kong) v Ng Yuen Shiu ... in which the Privy Council appears to have accepted the proposition that "a person is entitled to a fair hearing before a decision adversely affecting his interest is made by a public official or body, if he has "a legitimate expectation" of being accorded such a hearing" ... .
However, the justification for the proposition was said to be "primarily that, when a public authority has promised to follow a certain procedure, it is in the interest of good administration that it should act fairly and should implement its promise, so long as implementation does not interfere with its statutory duty ".
' (emphasis added) 
 

11 The Delegate had a statutory duty to consider, and decide, whether the Application met the requirements of the Act.
There could be no question of his being bound to follow his own earlier decision in the Core Country claim if he considered that it incorrectly applied the Act.
In any event, for present purposes the question is whether or not he was correct in his view of the Application.
That question involves an assessment of the Application and such other material as may permissibly be considered.
The Delegate's decision concerning the Core Country claim is irrelevant to my task.
PROCEDURAL FAIRNESS 
 
12 At a belated stage in proceedings, the applicant asserted that the Delegate had denied it procedural fairness in making his decision.
The claim appears to take two forms.
The first appears in para 61 of the second set of written submissions on behalf of the applicant as follows:
 
 'The [applicant] submit(s) that due to errors in the Decision by the Delegate they were denied the opportunity made available to them under the Native Title Act for their application to be assessed according to the appropriate criteria.
On this basis the [applicant] seek(s) an order from the Court that the Decision be set aside.
' 
 

13 This seems to mean that the alleged errors in the Delegate's consideration of relevant statutory criteria deprived the applicant of an opportunity to be heard.
Such an argument confuses procedural fairness with errors in the decision-making process.
Errors alone will not generally amount to a denial of procedural fairness although they may, in extreme cases, evidence a misunderstanding by the decision-maker of his or her relevant function.
That has not been suggested in this case.
A superficially more substantial argument appears at para 64 of the submissions where it is submitted that:
 
 'The [applicant] submit(s) that the fact that their application satisfied the Delegate in 2005 with respect to the same group, for the same country with the same traditional laws and customs represented by the same individuals as Applicant contributes to the unfairness of the decision that in the following year --- without reference to a cogent or relevant reason for a changed opinion and on erroneous bases, the decision was that the registration test conditions were not satisfied.
' 
 

14 This argument invites an examination of the duty conferred upon the NT Registrar (and therefore the Delegate) by the Act.
Sub-section 190A(1) required the Delegate to consider the Application.
In effect he had to decide whether to accept it for registration pursuant to s 190.
Subsection 190A(5A) provides:
 
 'Before the [NT] Registrar has decided whether or not to accept the claim for registration, he or she may notify the applicant that the application may be amended under the Federal Court Rules .
' 
 

15 The decision to accept or reject an application is a purely administrative function, the decision depending upon whether or not such application satisfies the prescribed criteria.
The Act does not suggest that the NT Registrar is to receive submissions as to any proposed decision.
If anything, subs 190A(5A) suggests to the contrary.
To impose such a requirement would, in my view, imply a similar requirement in many other statutory registration schemes.
This would be a considerable extension of the law.
The applicant's case is probably a little more refined than that.
It suggests that because of the previous acceptance of the Core Country claim, such an obligation may have arisen.
The applicant seems to submit that as the same Delegate considered both applications, special requirements of procedural fairness arose.
16 I do not see why that, presumably fortuitous, fact should affect any requirement as to procedural fairness attending the decision-making process.
The question must be whether any delegate would have been obliged to tell the applicant that he or she proposed to reach a decision which might be inconsistent with any earlier decision, by any decision-maker, involving the same applicant.
Such a requirement would produce considerable practical difficulties, particularly in view of the absence of any apparent statutory provision to that effect.
Unless a delegate had cause to refer to other earlier applications, he or she may not be aware of them, or may not realize that there is any arguable inconsistency.
He or she could hardly be expected to review earlier applications "just in case".
Further, there is no reason why such a requirement would apply only to serial applicants.
Any applicant might choose to rely on the fact that an earlier application by another applicant had been registered and adopt it as a precedent.
The applicant was aware of the relevant statutory requirements as to which it was obliged to satisfy the Delegate.
It was not entitled to rely on past practices.
17 In any event the Delegate, having performed a preliminary assessment, informed the applicant that there were difficulties with the Application.
In a letter dated 2 June 2006 to the applicant's solicitor, those difficulties were identified.
It indicated that the Application "may satisfy" many of the requirements of the Act, but that it did not satisfy the requirements of para 62(e) and subs 190B(5).
Those provisions concern the factual basis of the claim.
The letter also indicated that further information was required in connection with the matters prescribed in subs 190B(3) (identification of the claim group) and 190B(7) (physical connection).
In the case of subs 190B(3) the Delegate also indicated that the Application "may not pass" and that:
 
 'The section means what it says and the interpretation of it is well known to the [applicant's] representatives.

 
 There is material in the report by Rod Hagen which would appear to contradict or not agree with the description given at Schedule A.

 
 There is material in earlier applications involving the same or substantially the same group which does not agree with the present formulation.
' 
 

18 The letter clearly stated that it was for the applicant to satisfy the requirements of the Act.
