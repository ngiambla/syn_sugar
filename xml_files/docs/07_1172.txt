 INTRODUCTION 
 Nine 
 
1 The applicant ('Nine') decides the order in which television programs are broadcast by stations within the "Nine Network" ('the Nine Programming').
Those stations include TCN-9 Sydney, GTV-9 Melbourne, QTQ-9 Brisbane and NTD-8 Darwin.
Nine also provides content and branding rights to affiliates including metropolitan stations NWS-9 Adelaide, STW-9 Perth and to regional broadcasters such as WIN Wollongong and NBN Newcastle.
Nine acquires the rights to television programs which it believes will appeal to audiences.
It selects dates and times to broadcast those programs with an eye to maximising viewers.
It drafts or obtains short descriptors ('synopses') about the programs.
Nine then records the Nine Programming in various formats ('the Nine Schedules') for distribution prior to broadcast to stations within the Nine Network, its affiliates and the viewing public.
Those formats differ in appearance and content.
2 A "broadcast week" in the television industry commences on a Sunday and ends on a Saturday.
Viewers are typically informed of the date and time of a proposed broadcast, together with additional program information such as program classification, consumer advice and synopses, by television program guides published prior to the broadcast of a program.
Nine does not itself publish such guides.
The Aggregators 
 
3 That task is relevantly facilitated by three third parties: HWW Limited, eBroadcast Australia and Pagemasters Pty Ltd (together 'the Aggregators').
Nine supplies the Aggregators with a weekly schedule of the Nine Programming, two to three weeks prior to any given broadcast week ('the Weekly Schedule').
The Weekly Schedule contains time and title information for one broadcast week, additional program information and synopses.
The Aggregators aggregate the information provided by Nine in the Weekly Schedule with the program schedules provided by other Australian free to air television channels, namely the ABC, SBS and stations within and affiliated to the Seven and Ten networks.
Television program guides with information for all free to air channels ('the Aggregated Guides') are then published in publications such as TV Week and on websites such as the Yahoo!7 TV Guide , published at au.tv.yahoo.com/tv ('the Yahoo7 Guide').
The Aggregators are advised by Nine of any late changes to the Nine Programming so that such changes can be incorporated into the published guides.
Ice 
 
4 The first respondent ('Ice') provides a subscription based "electronic program guide" ('EPG') for television called "the IceGuide".
The IceGuide when uploaded on subscribers' devices displays details of the television programs scheduled to be broadcast by free to air television stations, including stations within the Nine Network, for the coming 6, 7 or 8 days.
It is essential to Ice's business model that those details are accurate.
Ice does not, however, receive information from Nine or the Aggregators about the time, date and title of programs proposed to be broadcast by Nine.
It says that it "predicts" that information for inclusion in the IceGuide based on its observations of Nine's past programming behaviour and knowledge of the television industry.
Ice then "checks" its "predictions" against publicly available program guides, that is, the Aggregated Guides.
If there is a discrepancy as to program title, date and time as between the IceGuide and the Aggregated Guides, Ice generally (but not always) amends the IceGuide to reflect the published guides.
THE ISSUES 
 
5 Nine asserts that copyright subsists in the Nine Schedules as compilation literary works within the meaning of s 10(1) of the Copyright Act 1968 (Cth) ('the Act').
It submits that any doubt as to whether copyright so subsists was extinguished by the Full Court decision in Desktop Marketing Systems Pty Ltd v Telstra Corporation Ltd [2002] FCAFC 112 ; (2002) 119 FCR 491.
The infringement allegations are founded on the assertion that Ice appropriates the ' skill and labour of authorship ' of Nine in compiling the Nine Schedules by reproducing program time, title and date of broadcast information from the publicly available Aggregated Guides.
6 Nine alleges that the IceGuide includes a close to 100% reproduction of the time and title information in the Nine Schedules, as updated by any late changes and that the activities of Ice in producing and disseminating the IceGuide involve five acts of infringement of the copyright in the Nine Schedules.
The second respondent ('Ice Holdings') is said to be jointly liable for those acts of infringement.
7 The allegations are denied by Ice.
Ice does not dispute that copyright subsists in the Weekly Schedule.
Ice asserts that it did not (and does not) copy the Weekly Schedule in creating and updating the IceGuide.
It denies taking all or a substantial part of the Weekly Schedule.
It denies that Nine owns independent copyright in components of the Weekly Schedule and submits that other Nine Schedules are not relevant to the proceedings.
Ice also seeks leave to file a cross-claim alleging that Nine has made unjustified threats of copyright infringement ('the second cross-claim').
An earlier cross-claim was discontinued.
8 Ice drafts its own synopses for inclusion in the IceGuide, which differ in content to those in the Weekly Schedule.
There is no suggestion that those synopses infringe Nine's copyright.
