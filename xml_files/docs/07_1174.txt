 

 The nature of the proceeding 
 
1 This appeal, pursuant to s 44(1) of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth) ("the AAT Act "), is from two decisions of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal ("the Tribunal").
The Tribunal decided that it did not have jurisdiction to deal with two applications for review made by the applicant.
Each of those applications for review related to a request made pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act 1982 (Cth) ("the FOI Act "), one to the Attorney-General and the other to the Minister for Justice and Customs ("the Justice Minister"), seeking access to certain documents.
Both the Attorney-General's office and the Justice Minister's office purported to transfer the respective requests to the Attorney-General's Department ("the Department"), pursuant to s 16 of the FOI Act .
There is a question in each case whether these purported transfers gave rise to a deemed refusal to provide access to the documents.
In each case, there is an antecedent question as to whether the purported transfer was valid, and a subsidiary question as to whether a transfer of a request absolves the original agency, to which the request is addressed, from the obligation to search for documents answering the descriptions in the request, to determine whether it has such documents in its possession.
2 In each case, the Tribunal's decision was given, and its reasons for decision were published, on 26 August 2004.
Each application for review was dealt with on the papers by consent of the parties to it.
The decisions and reasons are found in Bienstein v Attorney-General (Commonwealth) [2004] AATA 896 and Bienstein v Minister for Justice  Customs [2004] AATA 895.
3 When the original notice of appeal was filed in this Court, it set out a large number of issues, many of which could not properly amount to questions of law arising from the Tribunal's decisions.
By s 44(1) of the AAT Act , an appeal from the Tribunal to this Court is limited to a question of law.
Because the applicant was unrepresented, owing to her lack of means, I referred her to counsel, pursuant to the scheme for legal representation found in O 80 of the Federal Court Rules .
Subsequently, the applicant told me at a directions hearing that she did not wish to be represented by the counsel to whom she had been allocated, as she did not feel he had a sufficient understanding of administrative law.
She requested allocation to another counsel.
I declined, on the basis that the O 80 scheme is not designed to give a disadvantaged party choice of counsel, but to provide a means of assisting such a party, and the Court, when such assistance appears to be beneficial.
The scheme ought not to be treated as a form of legal aid, entitling a party to his or her choice of legal representative.
In the result, the applicant continued the proceeding, and appeared at the hearing of the appeal, without representation.
She filed two amended notices of appeal.
Even the latest version suffers from prolixity, lack of precision and the applicant's apparent desire to broaden the issues as much as she can.
Nevertheless, it is possible to discern from the amended notice of appeal filed on 13 September 2005, and from the argument that the applicant put most capably on the hearing of the appeal, questions of law which can be raised legitimately and which are of substance.
It is those questions which I have outlined above, and which are dealt with in these reasons for judgment.
The relevant provisions of the FOI Act 
 
4 Section 3 of the FOI Act provides:
 
 (1) The object of this Act is to extend as far as possible the right of the Australian community to access to information in the possession of the 
 Government of the Commonwealth by: 
 
 (a) making available to the public information about the 
 operations of departments and public authorities and, in 
 particular, ensuring that rules and practices affecting members 
 of the public in their dealings with departments and public 
 authorities are readily available to persons affected by those 
 rules and practices; and 
 
 (b) creating a general right of access to information in 
 documentary form in the possession of Ministers, departments 
 and public authorities, limited only by exceptions and 
 exemptions necessary for the protection of essential public 
 interests and the private and business affairs of persons in 
 respect of whom information is collected and held by 
 departments and public authorities; and 
 
 (c) creating a right to bring about the amendment of records 
 containing personal information that is incomplete, incorrect, 
 out of date or misleading.

 
 (2) It is the intention of the Parliament that the provisions of this Act shall 
 be interpreted so as to further the object set out in subsection (1) and 
 that any discretions conferred by this Act shall be exercised as far as 
 possible so as to facilitate and promote, promptly and at the lowest 
 reasonable cost, the disclosure of information.

 

5 Section 4(1) contains a number of definitions relevant to this proceeding:
 
 agency means a Department, a prescribed authority or an eligible case 
 manager.

 
 ... 
 
 Department means a Department of the Australian Public Service that corresponds to a Department of State of the Commonwealth... 
 
 request means an application made in accordance with subsection 15(1).

 
 ... 
 
 Tribunal means the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.

 

6 Part III of the FOI Act deals with access to documents.
It begins with s 11 , which is in the following terms:
 
 (1) Subject to this Act, every person has a legally enforceable right to obtain access in accordance with this Act to: 
 
 (a) a document of an agency, other than an exempt document; or 

 (b) an official document of a Minister, other than an exempt 
 document.

 
 (2) Subject to this Act, a person's right of access is not affected by: 
 
 (a) any reasons the person gives for seeking access; or 
 
 (b) the agency's or Minister's belief as to what are his or her 
 reasons for seeking access.

 

7 Section 15 provides as follows:
 
 (1) Subject to section 15A , a person who wishes to obtain access to a document of an agency or an official document of a Minister may 
 request access to the document.

 
 (2) The request must: 
 
 (a) be in writing; and 
 
 (b) provide such information concerning the document as is 
 reasonably necessary to enable a responsible officer of the 
 agency, or the Minister, to identify it; and 
 
 (c) specify an address in Australia at which notices under this Act 
 may be sent to the applicant; and 
 
 (d) be sent by post to the agency or Minister, or delivered to an 
 officer of the agency or a member of the staff of the Minister, at 
 the address of any central or regional office of the agency or 
 Minister specified in a current telephone directory; and 
 
 (e) be accompanied by the fee payable under the regulations in 
 respect of the request.

 
 (3) Where a person: 
 
 (a) wishes to make a request to an agency; or 
 
 (b) has made to an agency a request that does not comply with this 
 section; 
 
 it is the duty of the agency to take reasonable steps to assist the person 
 to make the request in a manner that complies with this section.

 
 (4) Where a person has directed to an agency a request that should have 
 been directed to another agency or to a Minister, it is the duty of the 
 first-mentioned agency to take reasonable steps to assist the person to 
 direct the request to the appropriate agency or Minister.

 
 (5) On receiving a request, the agency or Minister must: 
 
 (a) as soon as practicable but in any case not later than 14 days 
 after the day on which the request is received by or on behalf 
 of the agency or Minister, take all reasonable steps to enable 
 the applicant to be notified that the request has been received; 
 and 
 
 (b) as soon as practicable but in any case not later than the end of 
 the period of 30 days after the day on which the request is 
 received by or on behalf of the agency or Minister, take all 
 reasonable steps to enable the applicant to be notified of a 
 decision on the request (including a decision under section 21 
 to defer the provision of access to a document).

 
 (6) Where, in relation to a request, the agency or Minister determines in 
 writing that the requirements of section 26A , 27 or 27A make it 
 appropriate to extend the period referred to in paragraph (5)(b): 
 
 (a) the period is to be taken to be extended by a further period of 
 30 days; and 
 
 (b) the agency or Minister must, as soon as practicable, inform the 
 applicant that the period has been so extended.

 

8 Section 15A does not contain provisions relevant to the present case.
Section 16 should also be set out in full:
 
 (1) Where a request is made to an agency for access to a document and: 
 
 (a) the document is not in the possession of that agency but is, to 
 the knowledge of that agency, in the possession of another 
 agency; or 
 
 (b) the subject-matter of the document is more closely connected 
 with the functions of another agency than with those of the 
 agency to which the request is made; 
 
 the agency to which the request is made may, with the agreement of 
 the other agency, transfer the request to the other agency.

 
 (2) Where a request is made to an agency for access to a document that: 
 
 (a) originated with, or has been received from, a body which, or 
 person who, is specified in Part I of Schedule 2; and 
 
 (b) is more closely connected with the functions of that body or 
 person than with those of the agency to which the request is 
 made; 
 
 the request shall be transferred to the Department corresponding to 
 the Department of State administered by the Minister who administers 
 the enactment by or under which the body or person is established, 
 continued in existence or appointed.

 
 (3) Where a request is made to an agency for access to a document that: 
 
 (a) originated in, or has been received from, another agency, 
 being an agency specified in Part II of Schedule 2 or an agency 
 that is a body corporate established by or under an Act 
 specified in Part III of Schedule 2; and 
 
 (b) is more closely connected with the functions of the other 
 agency in relation to documents in respect of which the other 
 agency is exempt from the operation of this Act than with the 
 functions of the agency to which the request is made; 
 
 the agency to which the request is made shall transfer the request to 
 the other agency.

 
 (3A) Where: 
 
 (a) a request is made to an agency for access to more than one 
 document; and 
 
 (b) one or more of those documents is a document to which 
 subsection (1), (2) or (3) applies; 
 
 this section applies to each of those documents as if separate requests 
 for access had been made to the agency in respect of each of those 
 documents.

 
 (4) Where a request is transferred to an agency in accordance with this 
 section, the agency making the transfer shall inform the person making 
 the request accordingly and, if it is necessary to do so in order to 
 enable the other agency to deal with the request, send the document to 
 the other agency.

 
 (5) Where a request is transferred to an agency in accordance with this 
 section, the request is to be taken to be a request: 
 
 (a) made to the agency for access to the document that is the 
 subject of the transfer; and 
 
 (b) received by the agency at the time at which it was first received 
 by an agency.

 
 (6) In this section, agency includes a Minister.

 

9 Section 24 provides relevantly:
 
 (1) The agency or Minister dealing with a request may refuse to grant 
 access to documents in accordance with the request, without having 
 caused the processing of the request to have been undertaken, if the 
 agency or Minister is satisfied that the work involved in processing the 
 request: 
 
 (a) in the case of an agency--would substantially and 
 unreasonably divert the resources of the agency from its other 
 operations; or 
 
 (b) in the case of a Minister--would substantially and 
 unreasonably interfere with the performance of the Minister's 
 functions.

 
 ... 
 
 (6) An agency or Minister must not refuse to grant access to a document: 
 
 (a) on the ground that the request for the document does not 
 comply with paragraph 15(2)(b); or 
 
 (b) under subsection (1); 
 
 unless the agency or Minister has: 
 
 (c) given the applicant a written notice: 
 
 (i) stating an intention to refuse access; and 
 
 (ii) identifying an officer of the agency or a member of staff 
 of the Minister with whom the applicant may consult 
 with a view to making the request in a form that would 
 remove the ground for refusal; and 
 
 (d) given the applicant a reasonable opportunity so to consult; and 
 
 (e) as far as is reasonably practicable, provided the applicant with 
 any information that would assist the making of the request 
 in such a form.

 
 (7) For the purposes of section 15 , the period commencing on the day an 
 applicant is given a notice under paragraph (6)(c) and ending on the 
 day the applicant confirms or alters the request following the 
 consultation referred to in subsection (6) is to be disregarded in the 
 computation of the 30 day period referred to in section 15.

 

10 Section 24A provides:
 
 An agency or Minister may refuse a request for access to a document if: 
 
 (a) all reasonable steps have been taken to find the document; and 
 
 (b) the agency or Minister is satisfied that the document: 
 
 (i) is in the agency's or Minister's possession but cannot be 
 found; or 
 
 (ii) does not exist.

 

11 Section 30A(1) provides for an agency or Minister to remit all or part of an application fee, on certain grounds.
An applicant may make a written request for remission of the application fee.
Section 30A provides for a decision on such a request within a maximum of 30 days after the request was made.
By s 30A(1B) , if an applicant has not received notice of a decision on a request by the end of the period of 30 days, the agency or Minister concerned is taken to have made, on the 30th day, a decision to the effect that no part of the application fee is to be remitted.
12 Part VI of the FOI Act relates to the review of decisions.
Section 54(1) provides for internal review, in the following terms:
 
 (1) Subject to subsection (1A), where a decision has been made, in 
 relation to a request to an agency, otherwise than by the responsible 
 Minister or principal officer of the agency, being: 
 
 (a) a decision refusing to grant access to a document in 
 accordance with a request; or 
 
 (b) a decision granting access to a document but not granting, in 
 accordance with the request, access to all documents to which 
 the request relates; or 
 
 (ba) a decision purporting to grant, in accordance with a request, 
 access to all documents to which the request relates, but not 
 actually granting that access; or 
 
 (c) a decision to defer the provision of access to a document; or 

 (d) a decision under section 29 relating to imposition of a charge 
 or the amount of a charge; or 
 
 (e) a decision under section 30A relating to remission of an 
 application fee; or

 person under subsection 41(3); or 
 
 (g) a decision refusing to amend a record of personal information 
 in accordance with an application made under section 48 ; or 

 (h) a decision refusing to annotate a record of personal 
 information in accordance with an application made under 
 section 48 ; 
 
 the applicant may, by application in writing to the agency 
 accompanied by any application fee in respect of the application, 
 request a review of the decision.

 

13 Subsection (1A) provides for time limits on the making of an application for internal review.
14 Section 55 provides relevantly as follows:
 
 (1) Subject to this section, an application may be made to the 
 Administrative Appeals Tribunal for review of:

 accordance with a request, access to all documents to which 
 the request relates; or 
 
 (ab) a decision purporting to grant, in accordance with a request, 
 access to all documents to which the request relates, but not

 in accordance with an application made under section 48 ; or 

 (h) a decision refusing to annotate a record of personal 
 information in accordance with an application made under 
 section 48.

 
 (2) Subject to subsection (3), where, in relation to a decision referred to in 
 subsection (1), a person is or has been entitled to apply under section 
 54 for a review of the decision, that person is not entitled to make an 
 application under subsection (1) in relation to that decision, but may 
 make such an application in respect of the decision made on such a 
 review.

 

15 Section 56(1) provides:
 
 (1) Subject to this section, where: 
 
 (a) a request has been made to an agency or Minister in 
 accordance with section 15 ; and 
 
 (b) the period of 30 days, in relation to the request, mentioned in

 request was received by or on behalf of the agency or Minister; 
 and 
 
 (c) notice of a decision on the request has not been received by the 
 applicant; 
 
 the principal officer of the agency or the Minister shall, for the 
 purpose of enabling an application to be made to the Tribunal under 
 section 55 , be deemed to have made, on the last day of that period, a 
 decision refusing to grant access to the document.

 

16 Section 58(1) of the FOI Act provides:
 
 Subject to this section, in proceedings under this Part, the Tribunal has power, in addition to any other power, to review any decision that has been made by an agency or Minister in respect of the request and to decide any matter in relation to the request that, under this Act, could have been or could be decided by an agency or Minister, and any decision of the Tribunal under this section has the same effect as a decision of the agency or Minister.

 
 The Tribunal's reasons 
 
17 In its reasons for the two decisions, the Tribunal identified five issues with which it was required to deal.
