 BACKGROUND 
 
1 The appellant is a seven year old child who was four when the proceeding now under appeal commenced.
The respondent company conducts a child care centre which the appellant has attended since 2002.
In general terms the appellant's claim was that the respondent received funding from the Commonwealth Government's Special Needs Subsidy Scheme (SNSS) which it was obliged to apply wholly or substantially to assist him to access education and services.
The appellant alleged that the respondent had not applied the funds appropriately, thereby limiting his access to the service and education the respondent provided.
This was said to amount to discrimination contrary to the Disability Discrimination Act 1992 (Cth) (DDA).
2 The proceeding was heard in the Federal Magistrates Court.
At the conclusion of the evidence adduced by the appellant, the respondent made a no-case submission which the Magistrate upheld.
His Honour dismissed the proceeding with costs.
The appellant appeals from that decision.
Pursuant to s 25(1A) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) the Chief Justice has directed that the appellate jurisdiction of the Court be exercised by a single judge.
