 
1 This judgment concerns issues arising in respect of native title determination application Edna Van Hemmen and Ors on behalf of the Kabi Kabi People #3 v State of Queensland and Ors QUD136 of 2006 ("Kabi Kabi #3").
The issues for decision are those remaining from a number of notices of motion which came before me on 3 May 2007.
However it is important to note as a preliminary point that Kabi Kabi #3 is one of a number of native title determination applications which have been before the Court, instituted by members of the Kabi Kabi community, and in relation to substantially the same land.
The other native title determination applications include Lance Hill and Ors on behalf of the Kabi Kabi People #2 v State of Queensland QUD65 of 2006 ("Kabi Kabi #2") and Gubbi Gubbi #2 v State of Queensland QG6034 of 1999 ("Gubbi Gubbi #2") (discontinued on 22 February 2005).
