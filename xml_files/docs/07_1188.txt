 
1 This is an appeal from a decision of a Federal Magistrate who, on 23 March 2007, dismissed an application to review a decision of the Migration Review Tribunal ("the MRT").
The MRT had earlier affirmed a decision of a delegate of the respondent Minister to cancel the appellant's Student Temporary (Class TU) visa on the basis that the appellant had failed to maintain enrolment in a registered course.
2 The appellant seeks to rely on an amended notice of appeal dated 27 July 2007.
The amended notice abandons each of the grounds of appeal previously relied upon, and raises four entirely new grounds.
I shall return to that matter shortly.
3 It is necessary to say something briefly regarding the background facts.
The appellant is a citizen of the People's Republic of China.
He entered Australia on 2 September 2004 as a holder of a Student (Temporary) (Class TU) Subclass 571 (Schools Sector) visa ("the visa").
He had applied for that visa based on his enrolment at St Augustine's College in Sydney to study senior secondary years 11 and 12.
He was enrolled to study at that College from 31 January 2005.
4 It was a condition of the visa that the appellant comply with condition 8202 as set out in Schedule 8 of the Migration Regulations 1994 (Cth) ("the Regulations ").
That condition relevantly provides:
 
 
 "(1) The holder (other than the holder of a Subclass 560 (Student) visa who is an AusAID student or the holder of a Subclass 576 (AusAID or Defence Sector) visa) must meet the requirements of subclauses (2) and (3).

 
 
 
 (2) A holder meets the requirements of this subclause if: 
 
 
 (a) the holder is enrolled in a registered course ; 
 ... " 
 
 
 
 
 
 (Emphasis added.
) 
 
 
 

5 It appears that the Minister's Department was advised on or about 31 March 2005 that the appellant had been expelled from St Augustine's College.
On or about the same date, the Principal of that College wrote to the appellant in the following terms: 
 
 "This letter is to inform you that your position at St Augustine's College has been terminated as at today's date, 31 March 2005.

 
 Your attendance and behaviour within the College and the community is totally unsatisfactory for a student attending St Augustine's College.
In accordance with your visa regulations, the College has notified DIMIA of your misdemeanours.
" 
 

6 Also on 1 April 2005 the Department wrote to St Augustine's College seeking further information regarding the appellant's attendance at the school, and, if he were no longer enrolled, advice as to the circumstances of the termination of that enrolment.
The school replied that the appellant was no longer enrolled "due to serious misconduct".
7 Again on 1 April 2005 the appellant was given notice by the Catholic Education Commission, pursuant to s 20 of the Education Services for Overseas Students Act 2000 (Cth), that he had breached a condition of his student visa.
That notice particularised the breach as being his termination of enrolment at St Augustine's College by reason of "serious misconduct and failure to meet course requirements".
It advised the appellant that pursuant to s 137J of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) ("the Act ") his visa would be cancelled on the twenty-eighth day after the date of the notice, unless he reported to the Department by that time.
8 On 11 April 2005 the appellant attended the Department and was provided with a "Notice of Intention to Consider Cancellation".
That notice identified the possible ground of cancellation as being that the appellant had breached condition 8202 by failing to maintain enrolment in a registered course of study in Australia.
The notice further indicated that as a consequence his visa might be cancelled pursuant to s 116(1)(b) and 116 (3) of the Act and clause 2.43(2)(b) of the Regulations .
On the same day the Minister's delegate decided to cancel the visa and the appellant was provided with notice of that decision.
9 The appellant applied to the MRT for a review of the delegate's decision.
By letter dated 26 May 2005 the MRT provided the appellant with particulars of information that it considered would be the reason, or a part of the reason, for affirming the delegate's decision.
It invited him to comment upon that information.
That letter was provided pursuant to s 359A of the Act .
Relevantly it noted that the appellant's enrolment at St Augustine's College had been terminated on 31 March 2005 by reason of serious misconduct and failure to meet course requirements.
It further stated that he was not currently enrolled in a registered course of study.
10 By letter which appears to be incorrectly dated 7 May 2005 the appellant's legal representatives replied, advising that he had been enrolled in a different year 11 to year 12 course since 26 April 2005.
They also provided the MRT with written confirmation of his enrolment at Australian Pacific College, Southern Cross High School as from 26 April 2005.
11 The MRT conducted a hearing on 26 July 2005.
It found, on the basis of the documentary evidence, that the appellant was not enrolled in a registered course between 31 March 2005 and 26 April 2005.
It also noted that he had not been enrolled in a registered course as at the date of the delegate's decision, namely 11 April 2005.
12 The MRT found that s 116(3) of the Act and clause 2.43 of the Regulations , when combined with condition 8202, established a mandatory regime for the cancellation of a visa once there had been non-compliance with condition 8202.
It held that, on the basis of the above findings, it was bound to affirm the delegate's decision.
13 It should be noted that the MRT accepted that the appellant had provided a reasonable explanation as to why he had not enrolled in another course immediately after his enrolment was terminated.
In substance, he told the MRT that another student had made a false complaint against him, and that a criminal charge that had been laid was without foundation.
The MRT accepted that the appellant was entitled to the presumption of innocence as regards that charge, but stated that its only role in relation to condition 8202 was to determine whether a breach had occurred.
Having concluded that there was a breach, it affirmed the delegate's decision.
14 The application before the Federal Magistrate was based upon a number of overlapping grounds of review.
However, his Honour noted that the only relevant issue before the MRT had been whether or not there was a period during which the appellant was not enrolled in a registered course.
He rejected a submission to the effect that the MRT had been obliged to consider the situation that pertained after the period of non-enrolment had occurred.
He referred to the Regulations , as they stood before 8 October 2005, in support of that conclusion.
15 His Honour noted in passing that the Regulations had been amended as from that date to require the Minister to consider whether "the non-compliance was not due to exceptional circumstances beyond the visa holder's control".
He observed that that amendment took effect without retrospective operation as from 8 October 2005 after both the delegate's decision and the MRT decision, and was therefore of no assistance to the appellant.
16 The appellant's amended notice of appeal identifies four grounds of appeal.
