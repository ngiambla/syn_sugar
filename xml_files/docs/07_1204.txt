 
1 This is an appeal from a judgment of Scarlett FM who, on 12 April 2007, dismissed an application for review of an earlier decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal ("the RRT").
The appellant was not represented before me, though he was represented before the RRT and the Federal Magistrate.
2 The notice of appeal contains nine separate grounds of appeal.
As will become apparent, a number of those grounds raise matters that were not the subject of any consideration on the part of the Federal Magistrate.
3 It is necessary to set out, albeit briefly, the background facts.
The appellant is a Bangladeshi national.
He arrived in Australia in April 2004 and applied for a protection visa shortly thereafter.
On 1 July 2004, a delegate of the respondent Minister refused that application.
On 12 July 2004 the appellant applied to the RRT for review of that decision.
On 1 February 2005 the decision was affirmed.
However, on 17 July 2006, the Federal Magistrates Court set aside that decision and remitted the matter to the RRT to be reconsidered.
4 The RRT held a further hearing on 18 September 2006.
On 30 October 2006 it again affirmed the decision of the delegate, thereby denying the appellant a protection visa.
It was that decision that was subsequently challenged before Scarlett FM.
