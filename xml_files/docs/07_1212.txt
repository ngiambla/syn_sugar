 The nature and history of the proceeding 
 
1 The substantial issue with which these reasons for judgment deal is whether the standard of interpreting from one language to another during the course of a hearing in the Refugee Review Tribunal ("the Tribunal") was such as to deny the appellant the opportunity to give evidence and present arguments to the Tribunal, or to deny him procedural fairness.
As this issue was not raised during the hearing at first instance, in the Federal Magistrates Court, there is a preliminary question as to whether the appellant should be granted leave to raise it as a ground of appeal.
There is also an issue as to whether the learned Federal Magistrate was correct to dismiss the appellant's application because he had made a previous application with respect to the same decision of the Tribunal, which had been dismissed for non-appearance of the appellant at the hearing, and because his later application was made outside time limits in the High Court Rules.
2 The appellant is a citizen of Sri Lanka.
He arrived in Australia on 21 August 1999, accompanied by his wife and their son.
On 10 January 2000, all three lodged applications for protection visas pursuant to the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) ("the Migration Act ").
By s 36 of the Migration Act , there is a class of visas to be known as protection visas.
A qualification for a protection visa is that the person applying for it be a non-citizen in Australia to whom the Minister is satisfied Australia has protection obligations under the Refugees Convention as amended by the Refugees Protocol.
The terms "Refugees Convention" and "Refugees Protocol" are defined in s 5(1) of the Migration Act to mean respectively the Convention relating to the Status of Refugees done at Geneva on 28 July 1951 and the Protocol relating to the Status of Refugees done at New York on 31 January 1967 respectively.
It is convenient to call these two instruments, taken together, the "Convention".
For present purposes, it is enough to note that, pursuant to the Convention, Australia has protection obligations to a person who:
 
 owing to well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his nationality and is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country 
 

3 On 1 March 2000, a delegate of the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (subsequently the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, now the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship) (in all cases "the Minister") refused to grant protection visas.
The appellant and his wife and son all applied to the Tribunal for review of that decision.
By letter dated 20 July 2001, addressed to the appellant, the Tribunal advised the appellant and his wife and son as follows:
 
 The Tribunal has looked at all the material relating to your application but it is not prepared to make a favourable decision on this information alone.
You are now invited to come to a hearing of the Tribunal to give oral evidence, and present arguments, in support of your claims.
You are also entitled to ask the Tribunal to obtain oral evidence from another person or persons.

 

4 The letter fixed 10.00 am on 5 September 2001 as the time for the hearing.
Accompanying the letter was a form entitled Response To Hearing Invitation.
The appellant completed this form and lodged it with the Tribunal on 1 August 2001.
In response to the question "Do you need an interpreter?
" the appellant ticked the box marked "Yes".
He indicated that the language for which an interpreter was required was "Sinhalesi".
In response to the question "Do you have any special needs for the hearing?
(eg.
wheelchair access, male or female interpreter)", the appellant circled the word "male" and wrote beneath "male -- (we do not want mr [name of a particular person])".
5 The Tribunal arranged for an interpreter (not the person whom the appellant had said was not wanted) to be present at the hearing, by sending an Interpreter Booking Request form to an agency called On-Call Interpreters.
This form advised the name of the unwanted interpreter and, importantly, contained the words "Please note: If an interpreter accredited at the professional level (NAATI level 3) or above is not available please inform the Tribunal.
"
 
6 The Interpreter Booking Request form contained provision for the insertion by the agency of details of the interpreter to be provided.
These were completed, apparently by the agency, on 8 August 2001.
The form provided the opportunity for the agency to indicate the appropriate "NAATI Level".
The choices were the numbers 5, 4, 3 and 2 and the words "recog" and "none".
In the instant case, a tick was inserted under the number 2 and then apparently crossed out and replaced by a tick under "recog".
Beside the words "Reason for offered interpreter not being professional level or above" were listed three options: "this language/dialect is not tested at professional level; or very limited availability of professional level interpreters in this language/dialect; or no professional level interpreter available at requested date/time.
" In this case, the box beside "this language/dialect is not tested at professional level" was ticked.
7 Early in the Tribunal's hearing, there was a discussion about the fact that the interpreter had done some translations of the appellant's documents, and had thereby had some contact with the appellant.
The interpreter asked the Tribunal member whether, in the light of that, it was proper for him to interpret in the Tribunal hearing.
The Tribunal member said that he did not think that this was a problem.
The Tribunal member then raised with the interpreter the level of the interpreter's qualifications.
The interpreter said that he had "NAATI recognition".
The Tribunal member asked whether this was at level 3.
The interpreter said "Not level 3.
" The Tribunal member repeated these words interrogatively, and the interpreter answered, "Yes.
" Without further discussion as to the interpreter's qualifications, the Tribunal member embarked on the hearing with the interpreter interpreting.
8 The Tribunal's decision and reasons for decision are dated 19 October 2001 and were handed down on 9 November 2001.
The Tribunal affirmed the decision of the delegate of the Minister not to grant protection visas to the appellant, his wife and their son.
On 5 December 2001, the appellant applied to this Court, seeking to overturn the Tribunal's decision.
His application was remitted to the Federal Magistrates Court.
On 11 September 2002, Federal Magistrate Connolly dismissed that application.
His Honour's order records that counsel appeared for the Minister, and that there was no appearance for the appellant.
In the present appeal, counsel for the Minister made no suggestion that the dismissal was for any reason other than the non-appearance of the appellant.
9 On 8 October 2002, the appellant applied to the High Court of Australia for relief pursuant to s 75(v) of the Constitution in relation to the Tribunal's decision.
The High Court remitted the proceeding to this Court on 7 February 2003.
On 22 April 2003, Marshall J ordered that the appellant file and serve an amended application, containing proper particulars of the ground relied upon, and remitted the matter to the Federal Magistrates Court.
The appellant did not file an amended application, although he did file in the Federal Magistrates Court a statement of contentions, dated 10 June 2003, which does not bear the name of any legal practitioner.
That statement of contentions alleges that the Tribunal asked itself the wrong question, and that it failed properly to apply the real chance test and to undertake the required speculation.
Otherwise, by the statement of contentions, the appellant attempted to challenge a number of conclusions of fact expressed by the Tribunal in its reasons for decision.
On 19 August 2004, the Federal Magistrates Court dismissed the application and ordered that the appellant, his wife and son pay the costs of the Minister, fixed at a particular sum, reserving liberty to apply within 14 days of service of the order with respect to the amount of costs.
The appellant then appealed to this Court.
His notice of appeal did not raise the question of the standard of interpretation at the Tribunal hearing.
That question was not raised until the appeal first came on for hearing on 30 November 2005.
On that occasion, the appellant appeared unrepresented, with the assistance of an interpreter.
That interpreter, Mr Chandrasiri Ganegoda, advised me that the interpreter who had been present at the Tribunal hearing was not qualified to National Accreditation Authority for Translators and Interpreters ("NAATI") Level 3 or above.
Mr Ganegoda advised that, other than himself, there was no NAATI Level 3 Sinhalese interpreter in Victoria.
Quite properly, Mr Ganegoda did not wish to comment otherwise on the skills of the interpreter who had been present at the Tribunal hearing.
As a consequence of this discussion, I adjourned the hearing of the appeal, ordered that the appellant file affidavit material in support of an application for leave to add as a ground of appeal the proposition that the standard of interpretation at the Tribunal hearing was such as to cause the Tribunal to deny him procedural fairness, and ordered that the appellant pay the costs of the adjournment.
I also indicated that I was prepared to certify pursuant to O 80 of the Federal Court Rules for referral of the appellant for legal assistance.
Subsequently, affidavit material was filed, including an affidavit of Mr Ganegoda, who had listened to the tape-recording of the Tribunal hearing and had compared what the appellant said with the interpreter's translation.
Before the hearing of the appeal was resumed, the Minister also filed an affidavit of Mr Anuruddha Liyanage, who had also listened to the tape-recording of the Tribunal hearing and had made his own analysis of the interpreter's performance.
As there was little difference between the findings of Mr Ganegoda and Mr Liyanage, there was no cross-examination of either when the hearing of the appeal resumed.
10 On the resumption of the hearing of the appeal, the appellant was represented by senior and junior counsel, pursuant to the scheme under O 80 of the Federal Court Rules .
The appellant's claims 
 
11 The appellant claimed to have been persecuted in Sri Lanka because the authorities believed him to have been sympathetic to, and to have been providing assistance to, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam ("the LTTE"), an organisation devoted to seeking a separate Tamil State within Sri Lanka.
The appellant served in the Sri Lankan Air Force.
He was posted to a place close to Trincomalee, a predominantly Tamil area.
On a visit to Trincomalee during a day off, he renewed an acquaintance with an old classmate, a Tamil.
Thereafter, he visited his Tamil friend's house and sometimes stayed the night.
12 The appellant also visited his fiance in Negombo, near Colombo.
His Tamil friend organised his business trips so that they could go together in the Tamil friend's car.
On occasions, the Tamil friend allowed the appellant to use his car to go to Negombo.
On these occasions, the appellant carried parcels to deliver to the Tamil friend's contacts in Colombo, and would return with parcels for the Tamil friend.
13 In October 1992, while the appellant was off duty at his barracks, military police took him to the squadron leader who alleged that he had been helping terrorists by transporting contraband to Colombo.
The appellant admitted travelling to Negombo with his Tamil friend on some of the dates when he was alleged to have transported contraband, but denied any involvement in the transport of contraband.
He was told that his Tamil friend had been arrested and made a confession implicating the appellant.
14 The appellant was imprisoned and charged formally.
An inquiry was fixed for 20 December 1992.
He was allowed no visitors.
His mother died on 8 December 1992 and the appellant was allowed to attend her funeral under guard.
A relative helped him to escape and he hid at the relative's home for two years.
When his relative became unhappy with local gossip, in December 1994, he arranged for the appellant to go and work at a small tea estate.
The appellant worked there as a supervisor.
He went to Negombo in November 1995 and married in a quiet ceremony on 24 January 1996.
15 The appellant then worked as a fisherman, disguising his identity.
By July 1998, the Air Force was making inquiries of his wife.
He arranged to go with a fisherman to India, where he was introduced to the owner of a textile shop, in which the appellant worked.
He met an agent who arranged travel to other countries, and used the agent's services to bring himself and his family to Australia.
16 The appellant provided to the Tribunal a number of documents in support of his claims.
He also relied on a report of a psychologist, who found that the appellant was suffering from depression and anxiety.
The Tribunal's reasons for decision 
 
17 Because the appellant gave inconsistent evidence to the Tribunal, the Tribunal was not satisfied that he had anything to do with delivering parcels to Colombo for the LTTE, either knowingly or unwittingly.
Based on "country information", provided by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Tribunal considered it implausible that the appellant would have been considered to have been involved with the LTTE.
It also considered that his history of working in various places for long periods after 1992 was not consistent with him being a wanted man at that time.
As a result, the Tribunal did not accept that the appellant was detained in custody in 1992 as a result of his association with his Tamil friend.
It followed from this that the Tribunal found that the documents on which the appellant had relied had been contrived and manufactured to assist his application for refugee status.
The Tribunal also noted that the appellant was able to lead a normal life after 1992 and to marry and have a child.
There did not appear to have been much interest in him until well after that date.
Because of the passage of time, the Tribunal did not accept that the authorities were still looking for the appellant in 2000 and 2001.
The Tribunal considered that, if the appellant had escaped, he would have been detained a long time ago.
He had also departed the country on several occasions, and would not have risked this if he were a wanted man.
18 In the light of the "country information", the Tribunal took the view that Sinhalese people are not suspected of supporting the LTTE.
Even if it were wrong, and the appellant did commit some offence for which he ended up in custody, the Tribunal did not accept that it would have been because he was considered to support the LTTE.
As a result, the Tribunal found that the appellant did not have a well-founded fear of persecution because of any imputed political opinion, or for any other Convention reason.
19 Although the appellant did not put his case on the basis of desertion from the Air Force, the Tribunal considered this possibility.
It considered that it was most likely that the appellant would have been caught if he had deserted, and found that there was no suggestion that any action that might be taken in respect of desertion would be taken for any Convention ground.
Although accepting that the appellant had the conditions set out in his psychologist's report, the Tribunal did not accept that those conditions stemmed from his alleged arrest and escape, or that they had occurred as a result of any Convention-related matter.
The Federal Magistrate's reasons for judgment 
 
20 The Federal Magistrate rejected the appellant's application to set aside the Tribunal's decision for three reasons.
First, the application, so far as it sought the remedy of certiorari, was out of time under O 55 r 17(1) of the High Court Rules .
The court refused to enlarge that time under O 60 r 6 of the High Court Rules .
The court pointed out that the appellant, in the material he placed before the court, provided no grounds for an enlargement of the time limit.
The Federal Magistrate discussed authorities from the Full Court of this Court, referring to the possibility that, once the High Court remitted a proceeding to a lower court, the time limits in the High Court Rules were no longer of significance.
Her Honour did not seek to resolve the issue.
Her Honour pointed out that, although the appellant sought the remedy of prohibition (which was not subject to any time limit under the High Court Rules), he did not seek mandamus, and described the remedies of certiorari and mandamus as "necessary corollaries of prohibition.
" Her Honour then said that, in any event, delay in seeking such relief could be considered when exercising any discretion.
21 Second, the Federal Magistrate dismissed the appellant's application on the ground that it was barred by the principles of res judicata, as a result of the dismissal by another Federal Magistrate of the previous proceeding under Pt 8 of the Migration Act .
Her Honour pointed out that the appellant raised the same grounds as in the previous proceeding.
In addition, the grounds he raised invited the re-agitation of questions of fact, which the Federal Magistrates Court could not do.
In her Honour's view, the earlier order dismissing the first proceeding must be seen as finally disposing of the subject of the litigation.
The grounds relied on in the proceeding remitted from the High Court were no wider or greater than the grounds available in the earlier proceeding.
The same cause of action was relied upon in the two proceedings.
The substratum of facts giving rise to both proceedings was the same.
The substance of the two proceedings was the same, with the right to relief in each case informed by the same substantive law principles.
The parties to the two proceedings did not differ in any material respect.
Therefore, the earlier order finally determined the issue of whether the Tribunal was in error, being a constructive failure to exercise jurisdiction or an error of law in the interpretation and application of the Convention.
22 The third ground of dismissal of the proceeding was that, in any event, there was no jurisdictional error in the Tribunal's decision.
The Federal Magistrate summarised the reasons given by the Tribunal for dismissing the appellant's claims.
Her Honour pointed out that the Tribunal had the advantage of seeing and hearing precisely how the appellant gave his evidence, and made credibility findings adverse to the appellant, with which the court should not interfere readily.
The Tribunal was entitled to accept "country information" in preference to the appellant's evidence, and did so.
It was a matter for the Tribunal to determine the probity it accorded to various aspects of the evidence before it.
The Tribunal was not required to accept uncritically all or any of the allegations of the appellant.
The findings it made were open to it on the evidence.
There was therefore no arguable jurisdictional error.
The decision of the Tribunal was therefore a "privative clause decision", for the purposes of s 474(1) of the Migration Act , and could not be challenged in the court.
The grounds relied on by the appellant were not sustainable on a traditional judicial review approach.
The interpretation issue 
 
23 NAATI is a national standards body, established by the Governments of the Commonwealth, States and Territories.
It sets and maintains standards of translation for written communications and interpretation for oral communications.
It is also an accrediting body, providing the only officially accepted credentials for the profession of translating and interpreting in Australia.
24 NAATI currently accredits at four levels for translators and interpreters.
These levels are described as: Paraprofessional Translator and Paraprofessional Interpreter; Translator and Interpreter; Advanced Translator and Conference Interpreter; and Advanced Translator (Senior) and Conference Interpreter (Senior).
The level of Paraprofessional corresponds with what was called NAATI Level 2 at the time of the Tribunal hearing, and the level of Interpreter corresponds with what was described as NAATI Level 3 at that time.
Currently, the Interpreter level is described by NAATI as follows:
 
 This is the first professional level and represents the minimum level of competence for professional interpreting.
Interpreters convey the full meaning of the information from the source language into the target language in the appropriate style and register.
Interpreters at this level are capable of interpreting across a wide range of subjects involving dialogues at specialist consultations.
They are also capable of interpreting presentations by the consecutive mode.
Their specialisations may include banking, law, health, and social and community services.

 

25 The standard required for Interpreter accreditation is described as follows:
 
 This represents the minimum level of competence for professional interpreting.
It may be regarded as the Australian professional standard.
Interpreters are capable of interpreting across a wide range of subjects involving dialogues at specialist consultations.
They are also capable of interpreting presentations by the consecutive mode.
