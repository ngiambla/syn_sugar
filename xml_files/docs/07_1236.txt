 
1 On 22 June 2007 in respect of both QUD324/2005 and QUD522/2005 I ordered as follows:
 
 
 1.
The respondent has discriminated against the applicant within the meaning of s 6 and s 9(1)(f) Disability Discrimination Act 1992 (Cth).
2.
The conduct of the respondent was unlawful within the meaning of s 23(1)(a) , 23 (1)(b), 24 (1)(a) and 24 (1)(b) Disability Discrimination Act 1992 (Cth).

 

2 I note for completeness that a related claim, QUD211/2006, was discontinued by the applicant on 7 September 2006.
3 On 28 June 2007, I ordered that the parties file and serve submissions as to remedies and other dispositive orders and at the hearing on Thursday 9 August 2007 the parties made oral submissions in this regard.
Orders sought by the applicant 
 
4 In addition to the orders made by the Court on 22 June 2007, the applicant submitted that the following orders are appropriate in the circumstances:
 
 
 1.
The respondent must not continue or repeat such unlawful discrimination found to have been engaged in by the respondent.
2.
The respondent provide to the applicant a written apology for the unlawful discrimination.
3.
The respondent pay to the applicant damages by way of compensation in the sum of $40,000 for the loss and damage caused by the said unlawful contravention of the Disability Discrimination Act 1992 ("DD Act").
4.
The respondent pay interest on such damages.
5.
The respondent pay the applicant's costs of and incidental to these proceedings, to be taxed if not agreed.

 

5 In this case it is not in contention that the Court is entitled to make the principal orders sought by the applicant pursuant to s 46PO(4) Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1986 (Cth) ("HREOC Act").
This section provides as follows:
 
 If the court concerned is satisfied that there has been unlawful discrimination by any respondent, the court may make such orders (including a declaration of right) as it thinks fit, including any of the following orders or any order to a similar effect: 
 
 a) An order declaring that the respondent has committed unlawful discrimination and directing the respondent not to repeat or continue such unlawful discrimination
 b) An order requiring a respondent to perform any reasonable act or course of conduct to redress any loss or damage suffered by an applicant
 c) An order requiring a respondent to employ or re-employ an applicant
 d) An order requiring a respondent to pay to an applicant damages by way of compensation for any loss or damage suffered because of the conduct of the respondent
 e) An order requiring a respondent to vary the termination of a contract or agreement to redress any loss or damage suffered by an applicant
 f) An order declaring that it would be inappropriate for any further action to be taken in the matter.
