 
1 The Village Building Co Limited ('Village') is a land development company.
It is the registered proprietor of a 57.5% interest as tenant in common in two parcels of land known as Tralee North and Tralee South at Queanbeyan in New South Wales.
The land is presently zoned rural under the Queanbeyan Local Environmental Plan 1998 prepared under the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979 (NSW).
Village has sought to have the Tralee land rezoned to permit residential development.
2 The Tralee land is located in the vicinity of the southern flight part of aircraft landing and taking off from Canberra International Airport.
Canberra International Airport Pty Limited has been the lessee and operator of that airport since May 1998.
The airport lessee is responsible for the conduct of Canberra airport's business in accordance with the requirements of the Airports Act 1996 (Cth).
Canberra airport is a core regulated airport (s 7(1)(k)).
3 Airservices Australia has many functions under the Air Services Act 1995 (Cth) relating to aviation.
One of Airservices' functions is to be responsible for endorsing Australian Noise Exposure Indices/Forecasts for all Australian airports.
4 In early December 2006, the airport lessee submitted to Airservices, for the latter's endorsement, a draft Australian noise exposure forecast (ANEF) for areas surrounding Canberra airport.
The draft was an 'ultimate capacity' ANEF.
The draft ANEF projected that the ultimate capacity of the airport will be reached in 2050, some 43 years hence.
An ultimate capacity ANEF is one which assesses the maximum number of aircraft movements of which the relevant airport is capable, and then makes a noise exposure forecast of land in the vicinity of the airport in respect of that number.
Airservices completed its review of the draft ANEF and on 18 June 2007 advised the airport lessee that it considered the ANEF to be suitable for endorsement.
Issues 
 
5 Village claims that it will be adversely affected if Airservices endorses the draft ANEF because the Queanbeyan LEP and other New South Wales planning provisions will then operate to impose additional costs and restrictions on Village's ability to exploit the Tralee land if it is rezoned to permit residential development.
Village's application raises three principal issues as to the capacity of Airservices to endorse the draft ANEF, namely:
 
 1.
Village asserts that s 9(2) of the Air Services Act requires that Airservices must examine all the underlying assumptions on which the draft ANEF is based in order to see whether they provide a reasonable or realistic foundation for the projections which are based on them.
Airservices argues that its function of endorsement does not require it to make an assessment of the validity, commercial viability or likelihood of the assumptions which the proponent of an ANEF uses as a basis of its calculations.
2.
Village argues because the draft ANEF makes projections beyond the 20 year planning period under the Airports Act , it cannot be endorsed by Airservices.
The airport lessee argued that an ANEF could be made for any time period and that there was no requirement to limit it to 20 years or less.
Airservices and the airport lessee say that Airservices does not have a function of endorsing ANEFs under the Airports Act .
Rather they say that Airservices has a different function, which is to endorse ANEFs under the Air Services Act .
The Minister has not yet approved a manner of endorsing an ANEF under the Airports Act .
Accordingly, Airservices argues that any endorsement by it in the exercise of its functions under the Air Services Act of the draft ANEF cannot have any effect for the purposes of the Airports Act .
3.
Village argues that the draft ANEF is not capable of being regarded as an ANEF at all.
This is because, it argues, the draft ANEF is not a forecast within the ordinary and natural meaning of the word 'forecast'.
It says that a 'forecast' must be based on present indications of forecast usage of the airport and that the draft ANEF was not so based.


6 It is common ground that Airservices does not intend to afford Village any opportunity to be heard before Airservices endorses the ANEF.
Village asserts that Airservices is obliged to afford it such an opportunity.
The Australian Standard for ANEFs 
 
7 The assessment of potential aircraft noise exposure at a given site, for land use and planning purposes, is based on the ANEF for the site.
Standards Australia has published an Australian Standard: Acoustics --- Aircraft Noise Intrusion --- Building Siting Construction : AS 2021-2000 .
An airport lessee, in preparing a draft and final master plan under s 71(2)(e) of the Airports Act , must have regard to the Standard in developing plans for managing aircraft noise intrusion in the vicinity of an airport in areas forecast to be subject to exposures above 30 ANEF levels (s 71(8)).
The Standard explains that the ANEF system takes account of noise levels, frequency and time of day of aircraft noise events.
An ANEF depicts on charts noise exposure contours of 20, 25, 30, 35 and 40 ANEF.
The contours indicate land areas around aerodromes which are forecast to be exposed to aircraft noise at certain levels.
8 The Standard prescribes a number of particular consequences depending on whether a building is proposed to be sited in a location between the 20 and 40 ANEF contours.
The acceptability of a building site for the purposes of the Standard is dependent upon the type of building proposed and on the ANEF zone in which it is to be located as identified in Table 2.1.
The Standard suggests that there will be usually no need to have any further regard to it if a building site is outside the 20 ANEF contour, because then it is likely that the dominant source of noise will come from other than aircraft.
So, residential buildings will be acceptable for the purposes of the Standard if they are in an ANEF contour zone of less than 20 ANEF.
The Standard states that within the area from 20 ANEF to 25 ANEF '... aircraft noise exposure starts to emerge as an environmental problem, while above 25 ANEF, the noise exposure becomes progressively more severe'.
Thus, under the Standard, residential buildings will be conditionally acceptable where they fall within the 20-25 ANEF contour, but unacceptable where the zone is of a contour greater than 25 ANEF.
The latter concern is also reflected in s 71(2) of the Airports Act which requires an airport lessee to specify, in each master plan under that Act, its plans for managing aircraft noise intrusion in areas forecast to be subject to noise exposure intrusions of greater than 30 ANEF.
9 Appendix A to the Standard states that the ANEF chart for an airport will have been reviewed by relevant authorities before release, '... and the chart will display the official endorsement of Airservices Australia or the Department of Defence'.
Under the Standard, only one ANEF chart for a given aerodrome can be current at any one time.
For the purposes of the Standard a more recently endorsed ANEF chart will supersede an earlier one.
The Standard describes its App A as being only for information and guidance.
The way in which an ANEF contour map operates is described in App A of the Standard as:
 
 '... showing the forecast of noise exposure levels that will exist in a future year.
It may be for a particular year, generally about 10 years from the date of issue, or in the case of some of the busier civil airports, it may represent the airport operating at "ultimate capacity".
It is based on a firm forecast of aircraft movement numbers and operating times, aircraft types, destinations, flight paths and a given use of runways at the aerodrome.
' 
 
 The significance of the draft ANEF 
 
10 An airport lessee in the position of Canberra airport's lessee is required to prepare master plans under the Airports Act from time to time.
In 1997, Canberra Airport ceased to be a joint-user airport (see: s 7B(2) and reg 1.04 of the Airports Regulations 1997 (Cth)).
This had the effect that Canberra Airport is now governed by the provisions of the Airports Act , including s 71(2) , which apply to most of Australia's major city civil airports.
A draft or final master plan must relate to a period of 20 years, which is called the planning period (s 72).
If a final master plan for an airport is in force, and a more recent ANEF for the airport is endorsed in the manner approved by the Minister under the Airports Act , the airport lessee must give the Minister a draft master plan expressed to replace the current one within 180 days of the endorsement of the more recent ANEF (s 78(2A)).
An ANEF must be specified in every draft or final master plan (s 71(2)(d)).
11 Under cl 69(3) of the Queanbeyan LEP the Council may grant development consent to land zoned residential, which is located under a flight path in the 20-25 ANEF contour, only if it is satisfied that any building to be constructed will satisfy the provisions of the Standard.
The LEP defines an 'ANEF contour' to mean 'the noise exposure contour shown as an ANEF contour on the plan of Canberra (Fairbairn) airport or surrounding land prepared by an appropriate Commonwealth public authority'.
And, cl 69(4) of the LEP requires the Council to consider, in granting development consent, any noise exposure contour prepared for the land concerned by Airservices and to assess whether the proposed use of the building will be affected adversely by exposure to aircraft noise.
12 A draft amendment to the LEP was prepared by the Council in March 2005.
It proposed rezoning the Tralee land to residential.
A public inquiry into the draft amendment was proposed to be held in 2006.
13 Queanbeyan Development Control Plan No 49 --- Exempt and Complying Development, came into force in March 2007.
DCP 49 provides, in cl 3.3d, that development carried out on land within the 20-25 ANEF contour which is habitable or capable of habitation for residential purposes will not be 'complying development'.
'Complying development' is defined in s 76A(5) of the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act as local development that can be addressed by predetermined development standards in an environmental planning instrument made under that Act.
In other words, cl 3.3d of DCP 49 has the effect of requiring the Council to give individual consideration to conditions of consent for any of the Tralee land which is in the 20-25 ANEF contours.
14 In September 2005, the New South Wales Minister for Planning issued Ministerial Direction No 12 --- Development Near Licensed Aerodromes, pursuant to s 117 of the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act .
That provided that draft LEPs should not rezone land for residential purposes where the ANEF 'as from time to time advised by that Department of the Commonwealth [responsible for aerodromes and the lessee of the aerodrome] exceeds 25'.
The State Minister also directed that if a draft LEP rezoned land for residential purposes where the ANEF was between 20 and 25, the LEP must include a provision to ensure that any development meets the requirements of the Standard in relation to interior noise levels.
15 In the draft ANEF for Canberra airport some parts of the Tralee land are within the contour of 20-25 ANEF and other parts are within contours greater than 25 ANEF.
Hence, Village is concerned that if the draft ANEF is endorsed it will have the consequences, under the State planning laws, that its proposal to undertake a residential development of the Tralee land in the future will be affected adversely or its ability to exploit the land for that purpose will be inhibited.
