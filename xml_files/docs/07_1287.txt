 
1 Shane Terence Harrington was born in the United Kingdom on 14 March 1968.
He came to Australia on 5 July 1974 and was granted permanent residence on his arrival.
Immediately prior to 20 February 2007, Mr Harrington held a Return (Residence) (Class BB) visa, subclass 155 (Five Year Resident Return) which was granted to him on 12 September 2002.
On 20 February 2007 the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship exercised the power in s 501(2) of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) ("the Act ") to cancel Mr Harrington's visa.
2 Mr Harrington claims that the Minister's decision is invalid and he seeks constitutional writs directed to him.
He invokes the jurisdiction of this Court under s 39B of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth) (see also s 476A of the Act ).
3 On 17 August 2007, I made the following orders: 
 
 
 "1.
A writ of prohibition be directed to the respondent prohibiting him from acting upon or giving effect to his purported decision, dated 20 February 2007, to cancel the applicant's visa pursuant to s 501(2) of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth).
2.
A writ of certiorari be directed to the respondent to quash the decision to cancel the applicant's visa.

 
 
 3.
The respondent is to pay the applicant's costs.
"
 

I said that I would deliver reasons and these are my reasons.
4 The grounds of the applicant's application are as follows:
 
 
 "1.
A breach of the rules of natural justice occurred in connection with the making of the Decision in that:
 
 
 
 
 
 1.1 the respondent gave consideration to 'reports from the Parole Board of SA' (' the Reports ') in making the Decision;
 
 1.2 the Reports were classified as 'non-disclosable information' within the meaning of s 5 of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth);
 
 1.3 the respondent did not disclose the Reports to the applicant; and
 
 1.4 in the premises, the Reports were not 'non-disclosable information' and should have been disclosed to the applicant in their entirety for him to rebut or qualify by further information, and comment by way of submission; and
 
 1.5 in the alternative, to the extent that the Reports were 'non-disclosable information', the respondent should have put the substance of the matters set out in the Reports in a summary to the applicant for him to rebut or qualify by further information, and comment by way of submission.

 
 
 
 
 2.
A breach of the rules of natural justice occurred in connection with the making of the Decision in that:
 
 
 
 
 
 2.1 the Respondent, by way of his representatives including but not limited to Mr David Maynard, created an expectation in the Applicant that, in addition to any material submitted to the Respondent, the Applicant would be able to put further evidence 'at the next stage' of any decision to cancel his visa;
 
 2.2 in reliance upon the expectation, the Application did not put the following material to the Respondent:
 
 
 
 
 (a) further character references; and
 (b) information from the Applicant's fianc, Ms Rachel James, concerning the impact of the possible cancellation upon her and her children;
 (c) a detailed response to the report from Department of Correctional Services prepared by Ms Fiona Beevor that was before the Respondent;
 
 
 
 
 2.3 in the premises, the Applicant lost an opportunity to put his case to the Respondent and has been denied natural justice.
" 
 
 

5 As to the first ground, the applicant no longer contends that the reports from the Parole Board of South Australia ("Parole Board reports") were not non-disclosable information.
In other words, the applicant accepts that they were non-disclosable information within the provisions of the Act .
He contends that he should have been advised of the substance of the information in the Parole Board reports and that the Minister's failure to do so was a breach of the rules of procedural fairness.
As to the second ground, I heard evidence on the applicant's side from the applicant and his fianc, Ms Rachel James, and on the Minister's side, from Mr David Maynard.
6 It is convenient in this case to set out the relevant legislative provisions before setting out the facts.
Relevant legislative provisions 
 
7 For the purposes of this case, the relevant provisions of s 501 are as follows:
 
 "(2) The Minister may cancel a visa that has been granted to a person if:
 
 
 
 
 (a) the Minister reasonably suspects that the person does not pass the character test; and
 (b) the person does not satisfy the Minister that the person passes the character test.

 
 
 
 ... 
 
 
 (6) For the purposes of this section, a person does not pass the character test if:
 
 
 
 
 
 (a) the person has a substantial criminal record (as defined by subsection (7)); or 
 
 
 
 ... 
 
 
 (7) For the purposes of the character test, a person has a substantial criminal record if: 
 
 
 ... 
 
 
 
 (c) the person has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 12 months or more; or"
 (Original emphasis.
) 
 
 
 
 

8 The power in s 501(2) may be exercised by the Minister or, by reason of s 498 , by his or her delegate.
Under s 499 of the Act the Minister may give written directions to a person or body exercising the power in s 501(2) about the exercise of the power.
The Minister has given a written direction under s 499 and it is referred to as, "Direction --- Visa Refusal and Cancellation under s 501(2) --- No 21" ("Direction No 21").
If the Minister decides that he will personally exercise the power in s 501(2) , he is not bound by Direction No 21 although he may choose to follow it: Howells v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 327 ; (2004) 139 FCR 580 at 585 [31] .
9 If the Minister or his delegate decides to cancel a visa under s 501(2) a written notice setting out the reasons for the decision (among other matters) must be given to the applicant.
Section 501G provides:
 
 
 "(1) If a decision is made under subsection 501(1) or (2) or 501A(2) or section 501B or 501F to:
 
 (a) refuse to grant a visa to a person; or
 
 
 
 
 
 (b) cancel a visa that has been granted to a person;
 
 
 
 
 
 the Minister must give the person a written notice that:
 
 (c) sets out the decision; and 
 
 
 
 
 (d) specifies the provision under which the decision was made and sets out the effect of that provision; and
 
 (e) sets out the reasons (other than non-disclosable information) for the decision; and
 
 (f) if the decision was made by a delegate of the Minister under subsection 501(1) or (2) and the person has a right to have the decision reviewed by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal:
 
 
 
 
 (i) states that the decision can be reviewed by the Tribunal; and
 (ii) states the time in which the application for review may be made; and 
 
 
 
 (iii) states who can apply to have the decision reviewed; and 
 
 
 
 (iv) states where the application for review can be made; and
 (v) in a case where the decision relates to a person in the migration zone--sets out the effect of subsections 500(6A) to (6L) (inclusive); and
 (vi) sets out such additional information (if any) as is prescribed.

 
 (2) If the decision referred to in subsection (1):
 
 
 
 
 (a) was made by a delegate of the Minister under subsection 501(1) or (2); and
 
 
 
 
 
 (b) is reviewable by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal; and
 
 
 
 
 
 (c) relates to a person in the migration zone;
 
 
 
 
 
 the notice under subsection (1) that relates to the decision must be accompanied by 2 copies of every document, or part of a document, that:
 
 
 
 
 
 (d) is in the delegate's possession or under the delegate's control; and
 
 
 
 
 
 (e) was relevant to the making of the decision; and
 
 (f) does not contain non-disclosable information.

 
 
 (3) A notice under subsection (1) must be given in the prescribed manner.

 
 
 (4) A failure to comply with this section in relation to a decision does not affect the validity of the decision.
" 
 
 
 

10 Section 501G(1) engages s 25D of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 (Cth) which provides as follows:
 
 "Where an Act requires a tribunal, body or person making a decision to give written reasons for the decision, whether the expression "reasons", "grounds" or any other expression is used, the instrument giving the reasons shall also set out the findings on material questions of fact and refer to the evidence or other material on which those findings were based.
"
 

11 Section 501G(1)(e) and (2)(f) refers to non-disclosable information.
That term is defined in s 5(1) of the Act as follows:
 
 " non-disclosable information means information or matter:
 
 
 
 (a) whose disclosure would, in the Minister's opinion, be contrary to the national interest because it would:
 
 
 
 
 
 (i) prejudice the security, defence or international relations of Australia; or
 (ii) involve the disclosure of deliberations or decisions of the Cabinet or of a committee of the Cabinet; or
 
 
 
 
 
 (b) whose disclosure would, in the Minister's opinion, be contrary to the public interest for a reason which could form the basis of a claim by the Crown in right of the Commonwealth in judicial proceedings; or
 
 (c) whose disclosure would found an action by a person, other than the Commonwealth, for breach of confidence;
 
 
 
 and includes any document containing, or any record of, such information or matter.
"
 (Original emphasis.
)
 

12 Leaving aside s 501G there is no reference in s 501(2) or, any other section which might bear upon its interpretation, to non-disclosable information.
13 A person who is facing the cancellation of his or her visa under s 501(2) must be accorded procedural fairness: Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs; Ex parte Lam [2003] HCA 6 ; (2003) 214 CLR 1; Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, Ex parte Palme [2003] HCA 56 ; (2003) 216 CLR 212.
14 If the Minister's delegate makes a decision under s 501(2) then the affected party may seek a review of the decision by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal: s 500(1).
On such an application the Tribunal would consider the matter afresh and the applicant for review would be at liberty to put forward all the evidence he or she considered appropriate: s 43 Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 .
On the other hand, if the Minister makes the decision under s 501(2) an affected party could only challenge the Minister's decision by seeking constitutional writs against the Minister.
The grounds upon which the Minister's decision can be challenged in such proceedings are very limited in scope and would not involve a consideration of the merits of the decision and therefore of any further or additional evidence relevant to the merits of the decision.
The facts 
 
15 The applicant is a British citizen and, as I have said, he arrived in Australia in 1974.
He left Australia on 3 August 1987 and returned on 22 November 1992.
He has resided in Australia since that time.
16 Between 16 March 2000 and 7 June 2000 the applicant indecently assaulted his 14-year old stepdaughter.
He pleaded guilty to three counts of indecent assault contrary to s 56 of the Criminal Law Consolidation Act 1935 (SA).
On 6 December 2002 he was sentenced by the Chief Judge of the District Court of South Australia.
The Judge imposed one penalty under s 18A of the Criminal Law (Sentencing) Act 1988 (SA) of imprisonment of six years and six months with a non-parole period of four years commencing on 11 October 2002.
The applicant appealed against his sentence to the Court of Criminal Appeal, and on 30 April 2003 that Court declined to interfere with the head sentence but reduced the non-parole period to three years and six months.
17 The applicant was released from gaol on 15 June 2006.
He met Ms Rachel James shortly thereafter and commenced a relationship with her in early July 2006.
They are engaged to be married.
Ms James has three children.
The applicant was initially not permitted to have unsupervised contact with children, including Ms James' children.
He is now allowed to have contact with Ms James' children providing she is present.
18 In July 2006 the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs or officers of her Department gave consideration to the cancellation of the applicant's visa under s 501(2) of the Act .
A letter was prepared for the purpose of giving the applicant notice of an intention to consider the cancellation of his visa under s 501(2) of the Act .
The letter is not dated but it must have been prepared on or about 31 July 2006.
The letter advised the applicant that the Minister or a delegate of the Minister may cancel the applicant's visa in certain circumstances.
A copy of s 501 and Direction No 21 were attached to the letter.
The letter stated that if a delegate makes the decision he or she will be required to follow Direction No 21, whereas if the Minister makes the decision she may decide to have regard to the matters in Direction No 21 although she was not required to give consideration to those matters.
19 The letter stated that the Minister or delegate will take into account information in the following documents which were in the Department's possession:
1.
Immigration History;
2.
Certificate of Record for the sentence of 6 December 2002;
3.
Sentencing remarks made by the Judge on 6 December 2002;
4.
Community Corrections Report.
Copies of those documents were attached to the letter.
20 The letter stated that the Department had reports from the Parole Board of South Australia, but that those reports had been classified as "non-disclosable information" pursuant to s 5(1) of the Act .
The letter stated that the reports could not be released to the applicant, however, the applicant was invited to comment.
21 Mr Maynard is an immigration officer based in Adelaide.
He was involved in the process whereby consideration was given to the cancellation of the applicant's visa.
His involvement ceased in approximately September 2006.
He arranged to give the letter prepared in late July to the applicant at his house and to answer any questions he may have.
That was in accordance with the Department's then procedure.
Mr Maynard went to the applicant's house on 31 July 2006.
A conversation took place between Mr Maynard and the applicant.
I think that it may be inferred that at that point in time a decision had not been made as to whether the Minister or her delegate would make the decision under s 501(2).
22 The applicant gave a detailed account of the conversation and a summary of that account follows.
The applicant said that the contents of the letter prepared on or about 31 July 2006 were discussed.
He said that a number of particular matters were discussed including whether he should consult a lawyer and whether the Department would provide a lawyer for the purpose of providing advice, the provision by the applicant of character references and the contents of a report from Ms Fiona Beevor who was an officer of the Department of Correctional Services.
The applicant said that he strongly disagreed with a number of the statements in Ms Beevor's report.
The applicant told Mr Maynard that as far as obtaining character references was concerned he did not want to trouble people unnecessarily.
Mr Maynard told the applicant that he should try to obtain a reference from his mother, but that it was up to him whether he obtained a reference from Ms James.
23 The applicant asked Mr Maynard what would happen after the meeting.
Mr Maynard said that it was open to the Department to decide not to take any further action or to issue him with a warning or to move to the "next stage" (apparently Mr Maynard's words) of cancelling his visa.
The applicant asked Mr Maynard if he could appeal against the decision if it was decided to cancel his visa and the matter went to the next stage.
Mr Maynard said that the answer depended on whether the visa was cancelled by the Minister or by a delegate.
He explained to the applicant that an appeal would usually go to the Tribunal from a decision of a delegate, but that if the Minister cancelled the visa, the Tribunal would not be able to hear him and an appeal would go to the Federal Court.
Mr Maynard said that it was not usual that a visa would be cancelled by the Minister personally.
After being referred to statements in the letter about the information that would be taken into account, the applicant asserts that he said:
 
 "Well that's OK then if it does go to the next stage I know my family and friends would be happy to go to the Tribunal or the Court and speak on my behalf.
"
 

24 The applicant asserts in response to that comment that Mr Maynard said that he would be able to do that.
There was then a discussion about the applicant's rehabilitation and the fact that he was considered to be of too low a risk in terms of re-offending to participate in a program conducted by the Sexual Behaviours Clinic.
The applicant asked Mr Maynard to obtain a report from a psychologist who had examined the applicant, Mr Shawn Sowerbutts, and the reasons for judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal on his appeal against sentence.
25 The applicant said that the meeting ended on the understanding that Mr Maynard was going to make further inquiries.
The applicant was told by Mr Maynard not to do anything at that stage and that he would be contacted.
At that point, the applicant considered that it was unlikely that his visa would be cancelled.
26 In cross-examination, the applicant agreed that Mr Maynard had encouraged him to put his "best foot forward" on the consideration of whether his visa should be cancelled.
27 Mr Maynard had only a general recollection of the meeting on 31 July 2006.
He did prepare some notes when he returned to the office and those notes were typed up.
Those notes are not comprehensive as to the matters discussed at the meeting.
He cannot recall discussing the topic of the applicant obtaining legal assistance.
There was a discussion about how the decision would be made and the fact that decisions could be reviewed by the Tribunal or by the Court.
He cannot recall a discussion about the nature or process of appeal and he said that he would not normally discuss such matters.
Mr Maynard said that he did encourage the applicant to put his best case forward in his initial response and he said, in the context that the applicant was listing off the type of people he thought he could get references from, that references from immediate family members can be important.
He made it clear that it was the applicant's responsibility to provide a response.
28 In the cross-examination, Mr Maynard agreed that he could not recall a number of aspects of the conversation as deposed to by the applicant.
As to whether he agreed with the applicant that his family and friends could go to the Tribunal or Court and speak on his behalf, Mr Maynard gave the following evidence:
 
 
 
 "Question: You say in paragraph 3.2 of your affidavit that you don't recall discussing the nature or process of appeal, and that you would not normally discuss such matters.
Do you recall discussing what is set out in paragraphs 16 and 17 with Mr Harrington?

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Answer: Not specifically.
I certainly would have advised him that there was an appeal process, and depending on who the decision was made by as to whether it would go to the Tribunal or to the Court.
But I don't believe that I would have taken that conversation any further than that, because the prime focus then was for him to make his best case in the first instance.

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Question: In paragraph 17, Mr Harrington deposes to having said the words: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 'Well, that's okay then.
If it does go to the next stage, I know my family and friends would be happy to go to the Tribunal or the Court and speak on my behalf.
' 
 
 
 
 
 Question: Do you recall him saying those words?
Answer No.
"
 

29 Mr Maynard was a straightforward witness and I accept his evidence.
However, he was not in a position to deny clearly that part of the conversation which is presently relevant.
30 I have some reservations about accepting the applicant's evidence that Mr Maynard agreed with his statement that if the matter went to the Tribunal or the Court, his family and friends could give evidence on his behalf.
Although in general terms I accept the applicant as a witness of truth I think his recall of events and conversations was not as good as he would have me believe.
For example, the telephone conversation referred to below (at [31]) could not have occurred when he said it did.
Although I do not think he was fabricating his evidence, it seems to me that with the benefit of hindsight he suggested that things were said which I doubt were so clear at the time.
After all, the conversation with Mr Maynard took place in a context in which Mr Maynard was encouraging the applicant to put his best foot forward and the focus at that time would have been on the decision of the Minister or her delegate.
Furthermore, the applicant said that at that stage he did not think the Department would proceed with the cancellation of his visa and it seems that there was no particularly strong reason why the applicant would have seen the need to distinguish between the decision of the Minister or her delegate and an application or appeal from that decision.
Although in the end I accept that something was said by the applicant along the lines of what he deposed to and that Mr Maynard in a general way indicated his agreement with it, I would nevertheless have difficulty in accepting that in the circumstances then and later it would, without more, have led the applicant to act to his detriment.
However, as will become clear there was a second conversation.
31 Mr Maynard had some matters to follow up after his conversation with the applicant.
These matters were the applicant's attempted involvement in a program conducted by the Sexual Behaviours Clinic and the remarks made by the Court of Criminal Appeal on the hearing of his appeal against sentence.
Mr Maynard's notes of the conversation indicate he told the applicant that it was up to him how much, if at all, he involved his mother in the process whereby his visa might be cancelled.
32 As I have said, Mr Maynard was asked by the applicant to request a report from Mr Sowerbutts, and he did that by letter dated 15 August 2006.
The applicant said that he spoke to Mr Maynard in late August or early September 2006 and he requested Mr Maynard to obtain a report from Mr Sowerbutts which Mr Maynard agreed to do.
That conversation could not have taken place in late August or September 2006 bearing in mind the date of Mr Maynard's letter.
33 Various pieces of information were received by the Department.
34 Mr Maynard prepared a letter to the applicant dated 13 September 2006 which the applicant received on 20 September 2006.
The letter said relevantly:
 
 "Since the previous notification was sent to you, further information has come to the Department's attention that will be taken into consideration in making a decision on your visa.
You are provided with an opportunity to comment on the further information.
