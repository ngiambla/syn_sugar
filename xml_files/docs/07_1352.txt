 INTRODUCTION 
 
1 Xenical, the brand name for orlistat in 120 mg capsule blister packs, is a medicine that has been registered in the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods ("the Register") pursuant to Chapter 3 of the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 (Cth) ("the Act ") since 11 April 2000.
The applicant ("Roche") is the sponsor of orlistat within the meaning of the Act .
Relevantly a sponsor in relation to particular therapeutic goods is a person who imports the goods into Australia or manufactures, or arranges the manufacture, of the goods in Australia
 
2 Orlistat is a treatment for excessive body weight.
It is intended for persons with a body mass index ("BMI") greater than or equal to 30 (ie those who are obese) or persons with a BMI greater than or equal to 27 (ie those who are significantly overweight but not obese) in the presence of other risk factors such as diabetes and hypertension.
Material before the Court suggests that orlistat may thus be an appropriate treatment option for approximately 2.7 million obese adults and approximately 1.6 million overweight adults in Australia.
3 Since 1 May 2004 orlistat has been included in Schedule 3 of the Poisons Standard (see [12] below).
Consequently, since that date it has been able to be supplied to a consumer by a healthcare professional such as a pharmacist without a prescription.
In February 2006 the respondent, the National Drug and Poisons Schedule Committee ("the Committee") decided additionally to include orlistat in Appendix H of the Poisons Standard.
The inclusion of a medicine in Appendix H has the consequence that the medicine can be advertised directly to consumers.
4 The decision to include orlistat in Appendix H was confirmed by the Committee in June 2006 and took effect from 1 September 2006.
On or about 12 October 2006, following its receipt of complaints concerning the advertising of Xenical, the Committee decided to reconsider orlistat's inclusion in Appendix H. On 22 February 2007, the Committee decided to remove orlistat from Appendix H. On 26 June 2007 the Committee confirmed that decision with effect from 1 October 2007.
5 This proceeding was instituted on 8 June 2007 pursuant to the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 (Cth) ("the ADJR Act ") and s 39B of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth) ("the Judiciary Act ') to challenge the decision or conduct of the Committee of 12 October 2006 and the decision or conduct of the Committee of 22 February 2007.
An amended application was filed by consent on 9 July 2007 to include a challenge to the confirmation decision made on 26 June 2007.
6 For the reasons set out below I have concluded that the amended application should be dismissed with costs.
THERAPEUTIC GOODS ACT 1989 ( CTH) 
 
7 The objects of the Act are to do the following, so far as the Constitution permits:
 
 
 (a) provide for the establishment and maintenance of a national system of controls relating to the quality, safety, efficacy and timely availability of therapeutic goods that are: 
 
 
 
 
 (i) used in Australia, whether produced in Australia or elsewhere; or 
 (ii) exported from Australia; 
 
 
 
 
 (b) to provide a framework for the States and Territories to adopt a uniform approach to control the availability and accessibility, and ensure the safe handling, of poisons in Australia.

 
 
 

8 The Act includes an express acknowledgement that it is not intended to apply to the exclusion of a law of a State, of the Australian Capital Territory or of the Northern Territory to the extent that the law is capable of operating concurrently with the Act (see s 4(2)).
Each of these jurisdictions has enacted complementary legislation to regulate the availability of therapeutic goods and poisons (see: Poisons  Therapeutic Goods Act 1966 (NSW) and Poisons and Therapeutic Goods Regulation 2002 (NSW); Drugs, Poisons and Controlled Substances Act 1981 (Vic); Health (Drugs and Poisons) Regulation 1996 (Qld); Controlled Substances Act 1984 (SA) and Controlled Substances (Poisons) Regulations 1996 (SA); Poisons Act 1971 (Tas) and Poisons Regulations 2002 (Tas); Poisons and Dangerous Drugs Act 1983 (NT); Poisons and Drugs Act 1978 (ACT) and Poisons Act 1964 (WA).
)
 
9 Chapter 2 of the Act provides for the maintenance of the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods for the purpose of compiling information in relation to, and providing for evaluation of, therapeutic goods for use in humans (s 9A).
Chapter 3 is concerned with medicines and other therapeutic goods that are not medical devices.
This chapter provides for the determination of standards for such goods and for their registration and listing.
It additionally controls their manufacture in Australia.
Chapter 5 is concerned with, among other things, the advertising of therapeutic goods.
Chapter 6 is concerned with the administration of the Act.
Part 3 of Chapter 6 contains provisions concerning the Committee.
NATIONAL DRUGS AND POISONS SCHEDULE COMMITTEE 
 
10 The Committee was established as a statutory body in 1999 when s 52B was inserted into the Act (see Therapeutic Goods Legislation Amendment Act 1999 (Cth)).
The Commonwealth, each State, the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory are each entitled to nominate a representative on the Committee (s 52B(3)).
The explanatory memorandum in respect of the Therapeutic Goods Legislation Amendment Bill 1999 indicated that the assured representation of State and Territory Governments on the Committee was intended to encourage a uniform approach to the classification of substances throughout Australia for regulatory purposes.
Subject to the assured representation of State and Territory Governments on the Committee, the Committee is to be constituted, and to hold meetings and make decisions, in accordance with the regulations (s 52B(2)).
11 The functions of the Committee include the making of decisions in relation to the classification and scheduling of substances (s 52C(a)), the maintenance of the Poisons Standard (s 52C(c)), and the undertaking of public consultation with respect to matters relating to the classification and scheduling of substances that are of public interest or significance (s 52C(e)).
Section 52A defines "substance" to mean any medicine or poison and "scheduling" in relation to a substance to mean determining the schedule or schedules in the Poisons Standard in which the name or a description of the substance is to be included.
12 The Poisons Standard is a document the full title of which is the Standard for the Uniform Scheduling of Drugs and Poisons .
This document was initially published by the Australian Health Ministers' Advisory Council (s 52A).
Section 52D(2) gives the Committee power to amend the current Poisons Standard or to prepare a new document in substitution for it.
Section 52D(4) requires the Committee to cause a notice to be published in the Gazette in respect of each amendment of the current Poisons Standard.
The content of the Gazette notice is regulated by reg 42ZCY of the Therapeutic Goods Regulations 1990 (Cth) ("the Regulations") (see [20] below).
13 It is appropriate to set out s 52E in full:
 
 
 (1) In exercising its powers under subsection 52D(2), the Committee must take the following matters into account (where relevant): 
 
 
 
 
 (a) the toxicity and safety of a substance; 
 (b) the risks and benefits associated with the use of a substance; 
 (c) the potential hazards associated with the use of a substance; 
 (d) the extent and patterns of use of a substance; 
 (e) the dosage and formulation of a substance; 
 (f) the need for access to a substance, taking into account its toxicity compared with other substances available for a similar purpose; 
 (g) the potential for abuse of a substance; 
 (h) the purposes for which a substance is to be used; 
 (i) any other matters that the Committee considers necessary to protect public health, including the risks (whether imminent or long term) of death, illness or injury resulting from its use; 
 
 
 
 
 and may take into account the labelling, packaging and presentation of a substance.

 (2) In taking into account the matters referred to in subsection (1), the Committee must comply with any guidelines of the Australian Health Ministers' Advisory Council or the subcommittee of the Council known as the National Co-ordinating Committee on Therapeutic Goods, notified to the Committee for the purposes of this section.

 
 

14 Division 3A of Part 6 of the Regulations is concerned with the Committee.
The membership of the Committee is governed by reg 42ZCD which provides:
 
 
 (1) The Committee comprises each jurisdictional member and other persons appointed by the Minister under this regulation.

 
 
 (2) The Minister may appoint as a member an expert or a representative.

 (3) Each of the following persons is an expert : 
 
 
 (a) a medical practitioner expert in clinical pharmacology; 
 (b) an expert in veterinary medicine or pathology; 
 (c) an expert in toxicology; 
 (d) an expert in occupational health.

 
 
 (4) Each of the following persons is a representative : 
 
 
 (a) a person nominated by the Therapeutic Goods Administration; 
 
 
 
 
 (b) a person nominated by the National Registration Authority for Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals; 
 (c) a person nominated by an agency of the New Zealand government responsible for the regulation of medicines for human use; 
 (d) a person nominated by an agency of the New Zealand government responsible for the regulation of agricultural, veterinary and household chemicals; 
 (e) a person whom the Minister is satisfied represents the pharmaceutical, chemical, agricultural and veterinary industries; 
 (f) a person whom the Minister is satisfied represents practising pharmacists; 
 
 
 
 
 (g) a person whom the Minister is satisfied represents consumers.

 (5) For each category mentioned in subregulation (4), 1 representative only may be appointed.

 
 

15 Regulation 42ZCE provides that the following persons are jurisdictional members of the Committee:
 
 (a) each representative nominated under subsection 52B (3) of the Act; 
 
 
 (b) each of the persons appointed as a representative under paragraph 42ZCD (4) (c) or (d).

 
 

The persons appointed as representatives under regs 42ZCD(4)(c) and (d) will each have been nominated by an agency of the New Zealand Government.
16 Subdivision 4 of Division 3A sets out the procedures that the Committee must follow in holding meetings.
The Committee is required to act with as little formality and as quickly as the requirements of the regulations, and a proper consideration of the issues before the Committee, allow (reg 42ZCN(b)).
It is not bound by the rules of evidence and may obtain information about an issue in any way it considers appropriate (reg 42ZCN(c) and (d)).
17 Regulation 42ZCO(1) authorises the Chair of the Committee, by written notice to the committee, to "direct the committee to hold meetings at the times and places, and to deal with matters in the manner, stated in the notice" .
18 Regulation 42ZCR governs how decisions of the Committee are to be reached.
It relevantly provides:
 
 
 (1) A decision of the Committee is made by a majority of the members present and voting for the decision at a Committee meeting.

 (2) However, a decision has no effect unless the majority includes a majority of the jurisdictional members present and voting.

 
 

The Committee is obliged to keep a record of its proceedings (reg 42ZCS(1)).
19 Subdivision 5 of Division 3A is concerned with scheduling procedures.
Before a Committee meeting for the scheduling of a substance the Chair of the Committee must publish notice of the meeting in the Gazette and invite public submissions to be made by a date mentioned in the notice (reg 42ZCU).
The Committee, in making a decision in relation to the classification and scheduling of a substance, must consider all public submissions made by the closing date that address a matter mentioned in s 52E of the Act (reg 42ZCV).
A relevant submission prepared in relation to a substance by a Committee member and submitted before or at the meeting must be considered by the Committee at the meeting (reg 42ZCW(1)).
20 There must be public notification of an amendment to the current Poisons Standard (see [12] above) (s 52D(4)).
The Gazette notice concerning an amendment must include:
 
 (a) an indication of the amendment; and 
 
 
 (b) instructions on how the record of the reasons for the amendment may be accessed; and 
 (c) an invitation to persons who made a public submission in relation to the substance the subject of the amendment to make a further submission (reg 42ZCY(1).

 
 
 

An amendment must not be expressed to come into force earlier than four weeks after publication of the notice (reg 42ZCY(2)).
21 Regulation 42ZCZ provides as follows:
 
 
 (1) A submission in response to an invitation mentioned in paragraph 42ZCY (1) (c) must be made within 2 weeks after publication of the notice making the invitation.

 (2) The submission must: 
 
 
 
 
 (a) address a matter mentioned in section 52E of the Act; and 
 (b) be relevant to the reasons recorded for making the amendment.

 
 
 
 
 (3) If a submission is made to the Committee under this regulation, the Committee must consider the submission and then: 
 
 
 
 
 (a) confirm the amendment; or 
 (b) vary the amendment; or 
 (c) set aside the amendment, replace it with a new scheduling decision and publish notice of the decision under section 52D of the Act.

 
 
 
 POISONS STANDARD 
 
22 A copy of the Poisons Standard was not provided to the Court.
However, the applicant's written submissions described those aspects of it that are relevant to this proceeding.
The respondent accepted the accuracy of this description.
I therefore do likewise.
The following description is taken from the applicant's written submissions.
23 The Poisons Standard contains nine schedules although only Schedules 2-9 are used.
Generally speaking medicines are included in schedules 2, 3 4 and 8; poisons are included in Schedules 5, 6 and 7; and prohibited substances (such as cannabis and heroin) are included in Schedule 9.
The Poisons Standard also contains a number of appendices which supplement the schedules by setting out additional controls, qualifications and exemptions for some substances.
24 The schedule and appendix to the Poisons Standard in which a medicine or poison is included may affect the way in which matters such as the advertising, supply, storage and labelling of that medicine or poison are regulated by Commonwealth, State and Territory legislation.
For instance, broadly speaking, a substance included in Schedule 4 cannot be supplied except upon the written prescription of a healthcare professional with prescribing authority, whereas a substance included in Schedule 3 can generally be supplied without a prescription but cannot be supplied, except under licence, other than by a healthcare professional.
25 Section 42DL(1)(f) of the Act makes it an offence to publish or broadcast an advertisement about therapeutic goods that refers to goods, or substances or preparations containing goods, included in Schedules 3, 4 or 8 to the Poisons Standard.
However, it is a defence to such an offence if the goods, substance or preparations are mentioned in Appendix H of the Poisons Standard.
DECISION UNDER S 52D(2) LEGISLATIVE IN CHARACTER 
 
26 The ADJR Act authorises judicial review of administrative decisions only.
For this reason, to the extent that Roche claims relief under the ADJR Act , it is necessary for the Court to be satisfied that an exercise of the power of the Committee under s 52D(2) of the Act to amend the current Poisons Standard gives rise to a decision of an administrative character.
27 As the Full Court observed in RG Capital Radio Ltd v Australian Broadcasting Authority [2001] FCA 855 ; (2001) 113 FCR 185 ("R G Capital" ) at 194 at [40], there is no simple rule for determining whether a decision is of an administrative or legislative character.
At 194 at [44] the Court cited the following passage from the judgment of the Full Court in Minister for Industry and Commerce v Tooheys Ltd (1982) 42 ALR 260 at 265:
 
 The distinction is essentially between the creation or formulation of new rules of law having general application and the application of those general rules to particular cases: Commonwealth v Grunseit [(1943) [1943] HCA 44 ; 67 CLR 58] ; Hamblin v Duffy No 2 [34 ALR 333] and de Smith's Judicial Review of Administrative Action 4th ed, p 71.
In Commonwealth v Grunseit , Latham CJ expressed ... the distinction in these terms: 'The general distinction between legislation and the execution of legislation is that legislation determines the content of a law as a rule of conduct or a declaration as to power, right or duty, whereas executive authority applies the law in particular cases'.

 

28 In reaching a decision as to whether in exercising its powers under s 52D(2) of the Act the Committee was acting legislatively or administratively, it is necessary to have regard to considerations traditionally regarded as relevant for this purpose.
Nonetheless, the task ultimately is an evaluative one; a judgment must be made taking into account all relevant considerations, but no single consideration is likely to be decisive ( RG Capital Radio at 194 at [42]).
