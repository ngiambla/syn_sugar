 
1 This is an appeal against an order of a Federal Magistrate made on 18 August 2006 dismissing the appellants' application for judicial review of a decision of the Migration Review Tribunal ('the Tribunal') given on 24 August 2005.
The Tribunal had affirmed a decision of a delegate of the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs to refuse to grant the first appellant an Educational (Temporary) (Class TH) visa made on 25 January 2005.
2 The appellants are husband and wife who are nationals of the Republic of Korea.
The first appellant is the primary appellant, whilst the second appellant, the primary appellant's husband, relies on membership of the first appellant's family unit.
The first appellant will be referred to as the 'appellant'.
3 The appellant did not appear on the appeal.
On 13 December 2006 she was advised by the Court that the matter would be heard on 14 February 2007 at 10.15am.
On 19 December 2006 the respondents' solicitors also wrote to her advising her that the matter would be heard on 14 February at that time.
On 9 February 2007 the respondents' solicitors sent a copy of the first respondent's outline of submissions to the appellant and advised her yet again of the day and time of the hearing.
4 Section 25(2B)(bb) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) empowers a single judge of the Court to make an order that an appeal to the Court be dismissed for the failure of the appellant to attend a hearing relating to the appeal.
5 Order 52 rule 38A of the Federal Court Rules provides an alternative procedure.
That rule empowers the Court to proceed with the hearing either generally or in relation to any claim for relief in the appeal if a party is absent when an appeal is called on for hearing.
6 The first respondent did not seek an order under s 25(2B)(bb) but, instead, asked that I proceed with the hearing of the appeal and decide the matter on the merits.
That seemed to me to be appropriate and I proceeded accordingly.
7 On 29 July 2004 the appellant applied for the relevant visa to study as a cook in an unpaid traineeship for 12 months on the basis that the appellant had been nominated for occupational training by Shark Australia Pty Ltd ('Shark Australia').
Shark Australia lodged an application that nominated the appellant as a cook.
One of the criteria to be satisfied for the grant of the visa was that a 'nomination' in respect of the occupational training had been approved by the Minister: Schedule 2 Item 442.222(1) Migration Regulations 1994 .
Shark Australia's own application to become an approved nominator was refused by the Minister on 25 January 2005.
Because Shark Australia's application to be an approved nominator was refused by the delegate in a separate decision on the same day, that left the appellant without a nominator and therefore a valid nomination.
The delegate refused to grant the appellant a visa.
8 An application for review by the Tribunal of the decision not to grant the appellant a visa was lodged on 24 February 2005.
9 On 13 April 2005, the appellant was invited by letter to comment on the refusal of Shark Australia's application for a nomination.
The appellant was advised that the information was required because 'the Member may be unable to find that you meet Regulation 442.222 which requires you have a valid nomination at the time of decision'.
10 On 19 May 2005 the appellant responded by stating there was a misunderstanding regarding the capacity of Shark Australia as a nominator and that the company was qualified to provide occupational training.
11 On 27 June 2005, the appellant was invited to appear before the Tribunal to provide oral evidence and other written material at 10.30 am on 5 August 2005.
In a further letter dated 15 July 2005, the Tribunal rescheduled the time of the hearing to 12.00 noon.
The Tribunal's decision 
 
12 On the scheduled hearing date, the appellant failed to attend the hearing and the Tribunal proceeded to make a decision pursuant to s 362B of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) ('the Act') without taking any further action to enable the appellant to appear.
13 The Tribunal noted that at the time the application for the relevant visa had been lodged, there were provisions in the Regulations which set out the criteria to be met at the time of decision for grant of the subclass 442 (Occupational Trainee) visa:
 
 '442.222 (1) Except in the case of an application made in relation to occupational training to be provided by the Commonwealth, a nomination in respect of the occupational training has been lodged and has been approved by the Minister.

 
 (2) The reference in subclause (1) to occupational training to be provided by the Commonwealth includes occupational training to be provided by: 
 
 
 
 
 (a) a body corporate incorporated for a public purpose by an Act or regulations made under an Act; or 
 (b) an authority or body, not being a body corporate, established for a public purpose by, or under, an Act or regulations made under an Act.
' 
 
 
 
 
 
 

14 The Tribunal found the appellant did not provide evidence showing how his application met reg 442.222 of Schedule 2 of the Regulations.
There was no suggestion the appellant met the key criteria for any other subclasses.
Consequently, it affirmed the decision under review.
Decision of court below 
 
15 On 30 September 2005, the appellant sought judicial review of the Tribunal's decision in the Federal Magistrates Court.
