The respondent is a member of a group which operates another five hotels in Tasmania.
The Group is controlled by Mr Emmanuel Kalis.
About 29 staff are employed at the Hotel.
2 The applicant, a workplace inspector appointed under s 167(2) of the Workplace Relations Act 1996 (Cth), alleges that the respondent, in the course of endeavouring to have certain employees at the Hotel sign Australian Workplace Agreements (AWAs), (i) applied duress (contrary to s 400(5)) and (ii) injured them in their employment and/or altered their position to their prejudice for the prohibited reason that they were entitled to the benefit of the Australian Fair Pay and Conditions Standard (contrary to s 792(1)(b) and (c) and s 793(1)(i)).
3 The respondent has now admitted liability.
I have already made by consent orders for payments to certain employees and declared two AWAs void.
These reasons deal with the issue of penalties and declarations.
4 The following account is based on an agreed statement of facts submitted by the parties.
Acquisition of the Hotel 
 
5 In about November 2005 the respondent took over the ownership and control of the Hotel.

6 The respondent was bound by an award known as the Hospitality Industry - Accommodation, Hotels, Resorts and Gaming Award 1995 (the Award) in respect of all persons employed by it who performed work covered by the Award.
