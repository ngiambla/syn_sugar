 
1 On 22 August 2007 orders were made pursuant to s 411(1) of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) (the Act) convening a meeting of the ordinary shareholders in the plaintiff Orion Telecommunications Limited (Orion) for the purpose of considering a scheme of arrangement proposed between Orion and its ordinary shareholders.
I indicated that reasons for those orders would be given later.
These are those reasons.
2 Orion is publicly listed on the Australian Securities Exchange and its business is providing fixed line, mobile and data communications services.
The essence of the scheme was summarised by counsel for the plaintiff as follows:
 
 
 "(a) Orion shareholders ( Scheme Shareholders ) will transfer their shares to M2 Telecommunications Group Limited ( M2 ), also a company providing fixed line, mobile and data telecommunications services.
