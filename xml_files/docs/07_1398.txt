 The relevant legal framework 
 
1 Order 15A of the Federal Court Rules ('the Rules') was inserted into the Rules in 1988.
It allows for discovery to identify a respondent, discovery from a prospective respondent, discovery from a non-party, inspection of discovered documents and inspection, measurement, photocopying, preservation, custody and detention of property, the taking of samples, carrying out of experiments etc. (cf.
Order 17 rule 1 of the Rules in respect of inter-partes proceedings which have already been commenced).
2 Order 15A rule 2 ensures that a person providing discovery under Order 15A is not required to produce documents which, on the ground of privilege, the person could not be required to produce.
3 In relation to the inspection of documents discovered pursuant to an order made under Order 15A, Order 15A rule 10 provides:
 
 
 ' 10 Division 2 of Order 15 shall, with any necessary modification, apply to the inspection of the documents referred to in a list of documents made and served in accordance with this Order as if the list were a list of documents as mentioned in Order 15 rule 2.
' 
 
 
 

4 Order 15 deals with discovery and inspection of documents in normal inter-partes proceedings.
Division 2 of that Order deals with inspection and includes rules 10 --- 14.
Order 15 rules 11, 13 and 14 relevantly provide:
 
 ' 11 (1) Where: 
 
 
 (a) it appears from a list of documents filed by a party under this Order that any document is in his possession, custody or power; 
 ... 
 
 
 
 the Court may, subject to any question of privilege which may arise, order the party --- 
 
 
 
 (d) to produce the document for inspection by any other party at a time and place specified in the order; or ... 
 
 
 ... 
 
 
 
 
 
 13 (1) The Court may, at any stage of any proceeding, order any party to produce to the Court any document in his possession, custody or power relating to any matter in question in the proceeding.

 
 (2) Upon production of a document to the Court pursuant to an order under subrule (1), the Court may deal with the document in such manner as the Court thinks fit.

 
 
 
 
 
 14 Where an application is made for an order under rule 11 for the production of any document for inspection by another party or for an order under rule 13 for the production of any document to the Court and a claim is made that the document is privileged from production or an objection to production is made on any other ground, the Court may inspect the document for the purpose of deciding the validity of the claim or objection.
' 
 


 
5 By an Amended Application filed 9 August 2007 the applicant ('Telstra') applied for preliminary discovery of certain documents, of which the respondent ('the Minister') has or is likely to have possession.
6 The power of the Court to order discovery from a prospective respondent is to be found in Order 15A rule 6 which provides as follows:
 
 '6 Where --- 
 
 
 
 
 (a) there is reasonable cause to believe that the applicant has or may have the right to obtain relief in the Court from a person whose description has been ascertained; 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (b) after making all reasonable inquiries, the applicant has not sufficient information to enable a decision to be made whether to commence a proceeding in the Court to obtain that relief; and 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (c) there is reasonable cause to believe that that person has or is likely to have or has had or is likely to have had possession of any document relating to the question whether the applicant has the right to obtain the relief and that inspection of the document by the applicant would assist in making the decision; 
 
 
 
 
 
 the Court may order that the person shall make discovery to the applicant of any document of the kind described in paragraph (c).
' 
 
 

7 The documents in respect of which preliminary discovery is presently sought were defined in the Amended Application as follows:
 
 
 '... documents in the possession of the Respondent in the following categories: 
 
 1.
All documents (including but not limited to, correspondence and notes of any discussions between the Respondent or any officer, servant or agent of the Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts (the Department ) and OPEL Networks Pty Limited ( OPEL )) relating to the possibility of any applicant for funding under the Broadband Connect Infrastructure Program (the Program ) being able to submit an application seeking more than $600 million of funding, or being provided with funding in excess of $600 million, either under the Program or in addition to funding available under the Program.

 
 
 
 
 
 2.
All applications made by OPEL for funding under the Program and for any additional funding for its proposed infrastructure projects as described in the media release entitled "Australia Connected: Fast affordable broadband for all Australians" issued by the Respondent on 18 June 2007.

 
 
 
 
 
 3.
All documents relating to advice received from any probity or process adviser to the Respondent or any officer, servant or agent of the Department concerning: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (a) the amount of funding to be made available under the Program or in addition to that funding; and 
 
 (b) the advice to be provided to potential applicants concerning the amount of funding to be made available under the Program or in addition to that funding.

 
 
 
 
 
 4.
All documents relating to any assessment by the Respondent or any officer, servant or agent of the Department of the applications submitted by OPEL and the Applicant for funding under the Program or, in the case of OPEL, any additional funding, including all documents relating to the decision to award $958 million to OPEL which were prepared: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (a) by or on behalf of the Respondent; or 
 
 (b) by or on behalf of any officer, servant or agent of the Department who was wholly or partly responsible for the assessment of the applications.

 
 
 
 
 
 5.
All documents recording the decision to award funding under the Program to OPEL.
' 
 


 
8 It may be observed that under the Amended Application discovery is not sought of any documents of which the Minister has had, but no longer has, possession.
9 Whilst Order 15A makes no provision as to the means whereby discovery should be given by a party such as the Minister to a party such as Telstra, it seems clear to me that discovery must be given in the manner for which Order 15 rule 2(2) provides, namely:
 
 
 '2(2) Unless the Court or a Judge orders otherwise, a party must give discovery by serving: 
 
 
 
 
 
 (a) a list of documents required to be disclosed; and 
 
 (b) an affidavit verifying the list.
' 
 
 


Mansfield J expressed the same view in Global Intertrade Pty Ltd v Adelaide Festival Centre Trust [1999] FCA 162 at [2] .
10 The form of the list of documents may, in my opinion, be taken to have been regulated by Order 15 rule 6, which relevantly provides:
 
 
 '6(1) A list of documents required by or under this Order shall, unless the Court otherwise orders, be in accordance with Form 22 and conform to the requirements of this rule.

 
 
 
 
 
 (2) A list of documents shall enumerate the documents which are ... in the possession ... of the party making the list.

 
 (3) A list of documents shall enumerate the documents in a convenient sequence and as shortly as possible, but shall describe each document or, in the case of a group of documents of the same nature, shall describe the group, sufficiently to enable the document or group to be identified.

 ... 
 
 (8) Where a party making a list of documents has a solicitor in the proceeding, the solicitor shall certify on the list that, according to his instructions, the list and the statements in the list are correct.
' 
 
 
 

11 Form 22, of course, provides for documents to be enumerated one by one in either Schedule 1 Part 1, Schedule 1 Part 2 or Schedule 2 of the relevant list.
The operative words in Form 22 are:
 
 
 '1.
The party has in his possession ... the documents enumerated in Schedule 1.

 
 2.
The documents enumerated in Part 2 of Schedule 1 are privileged from production on the ground --- ... 
 ...' 
 
 
 

12 The Court should not allow its power to order the making of discovery by a prospective respondent to become an occasion for a trial within a trial.
However, in relation to the issues which are germane to the determination of an Order 15A rule 6 application, it is well established that the applicant's evidence may be tested and that a prospective respondent may tender evidence going to those issues.
Factual background 
 
13 It is inappropriate on an application such as that which is presently before the Court to make any findings of fact other than those that are proper in an interlocutory context.
From the evidence which is before the Court on the present motion, to which reference will be made shortly, it would appear that on 21 September 2006 the Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade issued a 'JOINT MEDIA RELEASE' under the heading '$600 million Broadband Connect program launched', which relevantly stated as follows:
 
 ' $600 million Broadband Connect program launched 
 
 The Australian Government will invest up to $600 million in rural, regional and remote Australia to encourage private sector rollouts of broadband infrastructure, Deputy Prime Minister Mark Vaile and the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, Senator Helen Coonan, announced today.

 
 Part of the $1.1 billion Connect Australia package, this is the second phase of the $878 million Broadband Connect program.

 
 The first phase of Broadband Connect is a per-customer subsidy paid to Internet Service Providers who connect customers in areas where a broadband connection is hard to get.
This subsidy model has already resulted in more than one million extra broadband connections in Australia.

 
 This second phase will support a small number of large scale infrastructure projects and leverage additional funding from the private sector and State and Territory Governments to extend the reach of broadband across rural, regional and remote Australia.

 
 "The Broadband Connect Infrastructure Program will build on the billion dollar investment the Australian Government has already made in rural, regional and remote communications by encouraging the roll-out of large scale, sustainable and scalable networks across Australia," Senator Coonan said.

 
 "By encouraging investment in infrastructure the Government's vision is to see more homes and businesses gain access to high quality broadband services, with those services able to grow to support the full range of existing and emerging broadband applications," Minister Vaile said.

 
 The program guidelines were released today with applications for funding to close on 30 November 2006.

 
 "Broadband infrastructure is the roads and railways of a modern 21 st century economy.
In regional Australia in (sic) can break down the tyranny of distance and help deliver essential health and education services through telemedicine and e-learning services," Senator Coonan said.

 
 "The Australian Government is committed to ensuring that this infrastructure is available to all Australians --- regardless of where they live," Minister Vaile said.

 
 Proposals submitted under Broadband Connect can also seek funding under the $30 million Mobile Connect program to improve mobile phone coverage or bid for funding under the $113 million Clever Networks program to extend fast broadband networks for education and health initiatives.

 
 The Broadband Connect guidelines were finalised after an Expressions of Interest process earlier this year.

 
 "There was a strong and enthusiastic response.
The overwhelming majority of the 69 responses strongly supported the Government's proposed alternative infrastructure-based approach outlined in the EOI," Senator Coonan said.

 
 "Several respondents are interested in developing proposals for major national or regional infrastructure projects that would result in well developed, end-to-end solutions of significant scale.

 
 "Some also proposed a consortium approach to bring together major transmission capacity projects (such as interstate links and local access solutions) that could be integrated into comprehensive national or regional projects.
" 
 
 The existing incentive-based element of the Broadband Connect program will continue during this financial year while the infrastructure-based program is developed, and appropriate transitional arrangements will be put in place.

 
 Broadband Connect is one of four programs being delivered under Connect Australia , the Government's $1.1 billion regional telecommunications package.
The Government intends to use the substantial funding it has allocated under the Connect Australia package to revitalise communities in rural, regional and remote Australia.

14 The 'Broadband Connect Infrastructure Program Guidelines' were recorded on 60 pages of typed script.
These relevantly included:
 
 ' 1.1.5 Expression of Interest (EOI) 
 
 On 8 June 2006, the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts announced a request for EOI to seek stakeholders' views on the Australian Government's proposed alternative approach to Broadband Connect.

 
 The alternative approach canvassed in the EOI was that the Australian Government would provide financial assistance (through a competitive grants process) to support large scale broadband infrastructure projects, primarily aimed at addressing currently under-served premises and areas.

 
 The EOI process invited interested parties to put forward ideas, plans and proposals to bring to fruition the Australian Government's broadband objectives.
The opportunity to provide a response to the EOI was available to all interested parties, including carriers and service providers.

 
 The Australian Government has considered responses to the EOI in assessing the feasibility of proceeding with the proposed competitive grants program under Broadband Connect.
As a result, the Australian Government is now implementing a Broadband Connect Infrastructure Program and is seeking applications for funding from interested parties on a competitive basis in accordance with these guidelines.

 ... 
 
 1.3 The opportunity 
 
 Under the Broadband Connect Infrastructure Program, the Australian Government will consider providing financial assistance for a small number of major projects of significant scale and service coverage.
The intent is to collectively provide sustainable wholesale broadband services as widely as possible across the geographic areas covered under the existing Broadband Connect program in order to provide broadband access to currently under-served areas and premises.

 ... 
 
 1.4 Funds available 
 
 Funding under the Broadband Connect Infrastructure Program will be provided to support the capital cost of establishing new broadband infrastructure, including upgrades to existing infrastructure, to enable the provision of wholesale broadband services to under-served premises and areas broadly across regional Australia.
Funding will not be provided to support the ongoing operation of networks established through the program.

 
 Up to $600 million may be available for this purpose, providing funding support for large scale broadband infrastructure projects.
Only one funding round will be held.
Depending on the nature of the applications received, the Australian Government may not allocate any or all available funds.

 
 Australian Government funding support will not be available for investments that are otherwise commercially viable.
Funding will support infrastructure that will service under-served areas or premises that otherwise would not get timely access to metro-comparable services through commercial investment alone.

 ... 
 
 2.1.3 Wide coverage of under-served premises 
 
 Applicants must demonstrate that proposed projects will cover significant numbers of under-served premises and that they will provide the required standard of wholesale broadband services to the vast majority of premises (including under-served premises) in the target coverage area.
This is because under-served premises are located throughout regional, rural and remote areas, including in regional and rural cities and towns as a result of technology impairments (e.g.
RIMs and pair gains).

 
 Under-served premises are defined as those premises within the Broadband Connect area that do not have sustainable access to a metro-comparable broadband service.

 ... 
 
 It is a requirement that proposed projects offer wholesale broadband services to the vast majority of under-served premises in the area covered by the proposed project (the "target coverage areas").
It is expected that proposed projects would cover at least 95 per cent of under-served premises within the target coverage area.
In relation to geographic areas this means that proposed projects must offer coverage across the populated parts of contiguous regional areas, given that under-served premises are generally located throughout such populated areas.

 ... 
 
 PART 3: APPLICATION ASSESSMENT STRATEGY 
 ... 
 
 3.4.3 Final assessment 
 
 Following receipt of all revised applications, the Australian Government will make a final comparative assessment to establish the optimal project or mix of proposed projects, aimed at obtaining best value in achieving the Australian Government's objectives.

 
 As a result of the final comparative assessment, the Australian Government may agree to offer a funding agreement to the preferred applicant(s).
Should the Australian Government be unable to finalise a funding agreement (or any other required documentation) with a preferred applicant, the Australian Government may, at its sole discretion, decide to grant funding to another applicant and invite that applicant to finalise a funding agreement and any other required documentation.

 ... 
 PART 6: MATTERS CONCERNING APPLICATIONS 
 ... 
 
 6.2 Confidentiality 
 
 The Australian Government will own applications.

 
 While an applicant will, as between itself and the Australian Government, own intellectual property rights that exist in the information contained in an application, the Australian Government and its advisers may reproduce, adapt, modify and develop such information for the purposes of the application and assessment processes and, to the extent necessary, the applicant licences the Australian Government and its advisers to do so.

 ... 
 
 Applicants should provide details in respect of any information that they would require DCITA to treat as confidential.
