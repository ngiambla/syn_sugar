 INTRODUCTION 
 
1 The applicant, Christopher Gerard Quinlan, is seeking damages and other relief against A  J Brady Pty Ltd ("A  J Brady") and various other companies within what I shall describe as "the Brady Group".
His claim is based upon breach of contract.
He also seeks relief against Anthony Brady who is, and was at all material times, the moving force behind the companies in that group.
2 In substance Mr Quinlan claims that in or about February 1998 he entered into a partnership agreement with the then members of the Brady Group, Mr Brady and Bernard John O'Sullivan who was also in the construction industry.
He alleges that the partnership agreement entitled him to share in the profits made by members of the Brady Group on existing and future property developments and construction work.
3 The respondents say that there was no partnership agreement of the kind alleged, and deny that Mr Quinlan is entitled to any damages or other relief.
THE ALLEGED AGREEMENT 
 
 4 In his Amended Statement of Claim, Mr Quinlan alleges that the terms of the partnership agreement were, inter alia, that:
 
 (a) each of Mr O'Sullivan and Mr Quinlan would provide loan funds of $500,000 to the Brady Group, if requested by the Brady Group, and otherwise the partnership's expenses would be funded out of cash flow from two developments, namely the Fairfield Views and Empire apartments projects;
 (b) each of Mr Brady, Mr O'Sullivan and Mr Quinlan would be engaged exclusively by the Brady Group as partners;
 (c) Mr Quinlan would hold the position of development manager, Mr O'Sullivan would hold the position of operations manager and Mr Brady would hold the position of sales and administration manager; 
 (d) Mr O'Sullivan and Mr Quinlan would each receive three percent of the profits earned by the Brady Group from its construction contracts for the Fairfield Views project and the development and construction of the Empire apartments project;
 (e) Mr Brady, Mr O'Sullivan and Mr Quinlan would each be entitled to a one third share of the profits from future property developments and construction work carried out by the Brady Group;
 (f) Mr Brady, Mr O'Sullivan and Mr Quinlan would each draw a monthly advance of $10,000 to be deducted from their respective profit shares when profit was realised;
 (g) each of Mr Brady, Mr O'Sullivan and Mr Quinlan would provide guarantees and other security to secure financing for future developments conducted by the Brady Group when requested by the Brady Group; 
 (h) each of the parties to the partnership agreement would act in good faith; and
 (i) the Brady Group would account to each of Mr Brady, Mr O'Sullivan and Mr Quinlan from time to time in respect of profits made by the Brady Group from property developments.


5 The agreement alleged was almost exclusively oral.
In particular, the terms referred to at (a)---(f) were said to be oral.
The Amended Statement of claim refers to a number of meetings at which the alleged agreement was said to have been made.
Two of those meetings were critical.
The first was alleged to have taken place at the Radisson Hotel in or around mid-January 1998 and the second at the Hudson apartments in La Trobe Street, on or about 2 February 1998.
The Amended Statement of Claim further alleges that on or about 5 February 1998 Mr O'Sullivan, on both his own and Mr Quinlan's behalf, and Mr Brady finalised the percentage of profit share that Mr Quinlan and Mr O'Sullivan would be paid from the Empire apartments project and the building contract at Fairfield Views (that is, the term referred to at (d)).
6 The remaining terms were said to be implied.
The Amended Statement of Claim alleged that the terms referred to at (g) and (i) were to be implied from the need to give business efficacy to the partnership agreement, and that the term referred to at (h) was to be implied by law.
THE EVIDENCE 
 
7 The question of whether the parties actually entered into the alleged partnership agreement depends largely on the facts.
It is therefore necessary to set out in some detail the evidence given by each of the three key witnesses, Messrs Quinlan and O'Sullivan for the applicant and Mr Brady for the respondents.
8 Mr Quinlan's evidence-in-chief was set out in two affidavits sworn on 5 December 2005 and 27 February 2007 respectively.
Mr O'Sullivan's evidence-in-chief was also set out in two affidavits.
These were sworn on 23 December 2005 and 27 February 2007 respectively.
Mr Brady's evidence-in-chief was set out in an affidavit sworn on 17 March 2006.
