 
1 The appellant appeals from the decision of a Federal Magistrate delivered on 22 September 2006 which dismissed an application for judicial review of the decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal (the Tribunal) delivered on 22 June 1999.
The Tribunal had affirmed the decision of a delegate of the first respondent to refuse to grant a protection visa to the appellant.
2 The appellant is a citizen of the Philippines who arrived in Australia on 18 December 1998.
She lodged an application for a protection visa under the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) (the Act) with the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs on 18 January 1999.
3 In her visa application, the appellant claimed to have a fear of persecution due to her uncle's political campaigning in opposition to incumbent politicians in the Philippines.
The appellant claimed that after these politicians won an election, her uncle had to move away and she and other members of her family had been subjected to threats and intimidation.
She stated that she changed her name and moved to Australia to escape the threats and intimidation.
On 22 January 1999, a delegate of the first respondent refused the application.
4 On 16 February 1999, the appellant applied to the Tribunal for a review of the decision of the delegate.
The appellant was at that time represented by a solicitor.
5 In a letter addressed to the appellant, care of her solicitor, dated 5 March 1999 and headed "Notice under s 426 of the Migration Act 1958 ", the Tribunal said:
 
 The Tribunal has looked at all the material relating to your application but it is not prepared to make a favourable decision on this information alone.
You are now entitled to come to a hearing of the Tribunal to give oral evidence in support of your claims.
You are also entitled to ask the Tribunal to obtain oral evidence from another person.
