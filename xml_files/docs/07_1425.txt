 
1 The respondent, Karellas Investments Pty Ltd (ACN 008 547 911) ('Karellas') is the proprietor of two retail stores which trade under the 'I.G.A.
' banner, one at Cremorne and the other at Blaxland in the State of New South Wales.
In April 2007 it had 85 employees at its Cremorne store and 151 employees at its Blaxland store who answered the description of shop assistants, butchers, apprentice butchers, pastry cooks, bakers, apprentice bakers and/or apprentice pastry cooks, some of whom were identified as 'Adult' and others as '-19 years'.
2 One such employee at the Blaxland store was Sandra Elisabeth Stringer who worked for Karellas as a permanent part-time night fill retail assistant.
She was a member of the New South Wales branch of the applicant.
3 The applicant alleges that Karellas contravened s 341(1) of the Workplace Relations Act 1996 (Cth) ('the Act') on or about 1 May 2007 when it lodged an employee collective agreement with the Employment Advocate which had 'not been approved in accordance with section 340' of the Act.
4 The applicant also alleges that the respondent made false or misleading statements to another person in circumstances that constituted a contravention of s 401(1) of the Act in or about 19 --- 27 April 2007.
Workplace Agreements 
 
5 Sections 326 --- 332 of the Act make provision for the making of various forms of workplace agreements.
These may take the form of an 'AWA' or 'Australian workplace agreement', which is made in writing between a particular employer and a particular person whose employment is subject to the agreement, or collective agreements, variously described as employee collective agreements, union collective agreements, employer greenfields agreements, union greenfields agreements and multiple-business agreements.
This case is concerned with the making of an employee collective agreement.
6 Section 327 of the Act provided:
 
 
 '327 An employer may make an agreement (an employee collective agreement ) in writing with persons employed at the time in a single business (or part of a single business) of the employer whose employment will be subject to the agreement.
' 
 
 

7 An employee collective agreement is made at the time when the agreement is approved in accordance with s 340 of the Act (see s 333(b)).
8 Section 418 of the Act provided for the making of regulations in relation to, amongst other things, the signing of workplace agreements by persons bound by those agreements, or representatives of those persons.
9 Regulation 8.13 of the Workplace Relations Regulations 2006 (Cth) ('the Regulations') relevantly provided:
 
 '8.13(1) For paragraph 418(e) of the Act, an employer must obtain the signatures of: 
 
 
 
 (a) for all workplace agreements --- the employer ... in relation to the agreement; and 
 
 (b) in addition to paragraph (a): 
 
 
 (i) if the workplace agreement is an employee collective agreement --- a representative of the employees to the agreement ... 
 
 
 
 ... 
 
 
 
 
 (2) For subregulation (1), a signature to the workplace agreement must be accompanied by: 
 
 
 
 
 
 (a) the full name and address of each person signing the workplace agreement in accordance with subregulation (1); and 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (b) an explanation of the person's authority to sign the workplace agreement.

 
 
 ... 
 
 
 
 (5) The validity of a workplace agreement is not affected by a failure to comply with subregulations (1) and (2).
' 


 
10 Under s 347(1) of the Act a workplace agreement comes into operation on the day the agreement is lodged with the Employment Advocate.
By virtue of s 347(2), such an agreement 'comes into operation even if the requirements in Divisions 3 and 4 [ss 334-341] and section 342 have not been met in relation to the agreement'.
11 By virtue of s 351 of the Act a workplace agreement that is in operation relevantly binds the employer in relation to the agreement and all persons whose employment is, at any time when the agreement is in operation, subject to the agreement.
The proceedings 
 
12 The applicant is an organisation of employees that represents an employee who is or will be bound by the employee collective agreement ('the 2007 Agreement') which was lodged on 1 May 2007 with the Employment Advocate, in this case.
Ms Stringer, an employee of Karellas who is bound by the 2007 Agreement, requested the applicant to make the application presently before the Court for an order under Division 11 of Part 8 of the Act in relation to the 2007 Agreement.
It is common ground that the requirements of s 405(3) of the Act have been satisfied.
Accordingly, the applicant is a competent applicant in respect of the present application within the meaning of s 405(1)(d) of the Act, brought by it on behalf of Ms Stringer.
13 In respect of the contraventions which have been alleged it would be open to the Court to order the payment of pecuniary penalties in respect of each contravention up to $33,000.
However, no such relief is sought.
All that is sought is an order under s 409(a) of the Act.
In that regard, the Act relevantly provided:
 
 '409 The Court may make an order: 
 
 
 (a) declaring that the workplace agreement is void; ... 
 ... 
 
 
 
 
 
 412(1) An order under section 409 ... takes effect from the date of the order or a later date specified in the order.

 
 (2) The Court may make an order under section 409 ... only to the extent that the Court considers appropriate to remedy the following: 
 
 
 
 
 (a) all or part of any loss or damage resulting from the contravention mentioned in section 408 [in this case a contravention of s 341(1) and/or s 401(1)] ; 
 
 
 
 
 (b) prevention or reduction of all or part of that loss or damage.
' 
 
 
 (emphasis added)
 

14 In clause 1 of Schedule 7 to the Act entitled 'Transitional arrangements for existing pre-reform Federal agreements etc' (see s 8 of the Act) 'pre-reform certified agreement' was defined to mean an agreement that:
 
 
 '(a) was made under Division 2 or 3 of Part VIB of this Act before the reform commencement; and 
 
 (b) was certified under Division 4 of Part VIB of this Act (whether before the reform commencement, or after the reform commencement because of Part 8 of this Schedule).
' 
 
 

The reform commencement was 27 March 2006.
15 In relation to pre-reform certified agreements Part 2 of Schedule 7 relevantly provided:
 
 
 '3(1) A pre-reform certified agreement ceases to be in operation in relation to an employee if a collective agreement ... comes into operation in relation to that employee.

 ... 
 (5) If a pre-reform certified agreement has ceased operating in relation to an employee because of subclause (1), the agreement can never operate again in relation to that employee.

 ... 
 
 5(1) While a pre-reform certified agreement is in operation, it prevails, to the extent of any inconsistency, over: 
 
 
 
 
 
 (a) a preserved State agreement; or 
 
 (b) a notional agreement preserving State awards.

 
 
 
 
 
 (2) While a pre-reform certified agreement is in operation, it prevails over an award to the extent of any inconsistency ... 
 ...' 
 
 
 The Employee Collective Agreement 
 
16 The 2007 Agreement in respect of which relief is sought as aforesaid is annexure 'A' to an affidavit of David John Bliss sworn 4 May 2007.
It is 16 pages in length.
It is entitled ' KARELLAS INVESTMENTS PTY LTD EMPLOYEE COLLECTIVE AGREEMENT 2007 ' and is expressed to be made:
 
 ' BETWEEN 
 
 Employer: Karellas Investments Pty Ltd 
 A.B.N: 48 008 547 911 
 
 AND 
 
 Employees of the Employer bound by this Agreement' 


 
17 Clause 3 of the 2007 Agreement provides for it to have a 'nominal term of 5 years from the date on which the Agreement is lodged with the OEA'.
18 The relationship between the 2007 Agreement and an individual employee's contract of employment with Karellas was dealt with in clauses 3 and 4 of the 2007 Agreement as follows:
 
 
 '3.2 This Agreement provides for minimum legal entitlements only, and shall not restrict the Employer and Employee/s from agreeing to higher rates of pay, or additional benefits.

 
 3.3 All Protected Allowable Award Matters are expressly excluded from operation by this Agreement.

 
 4.1 The employment status of Employees shall be as agreed between the Parties and recorded in writing.
This status will be permanent, salaried or casual.
' 
 


 
19 Under the heading ' Minimum Wages for Ordinary Hours ' clause 8 of the 2007 Agreement provided, inter alia:
 
 '8.1 The minimum rates of pay for each hour worked by Existing Employees are in accordance with the Australian fair Pay and Condition Standard (AFPCS) and as specified in clause 9 to this Agreement.
These rates will be adjusted proportionate to movements in the AFPCS as amended by the Australian Fair Pay Commission from time to time.

 ... 
 
 8.4 Casual Employees will be entitled to the appropriate casual rate of pay in accordance with the Australian fair Pay and Conditions Standard, which includes a casual loading of 20%.

 ...' 
 

20 Clause 9 of the 2007 Agreement under the heading ' Penalty Rates ' provided:
 
 
 '9.1 Non-Salaried Existing Employees are entitled to the following penalties.

 
 
 
 
 
 9.2 All hours worked by an Existing Employee on a Sunday between 5 am and midnight shall be paid at a rate of time and a half the Existing Employee's ordinary hourly rate of pay.

 
 
 
 
 
 9.3 All hours worked by an Existing Employee between midnight and 5 am on any day from midnight Sunday to 5 am Saturday shall be paid at a rate of time and a quarter the Existing Employee's ordinary hourly rate of pay.

 
 
 
 
 
 9.4 All hours worked by an Existing Employee on a Public Holiday, as defined by clause 13 of this agreement, shall be paid at a rate of double time the Existing Employee's ordinary hourly rate of pay.
' 
 
 
 

21 In s 4(1) of the Act 'Australian Fair Pay and Conditions Standard' was given the meaning for which s 171(3) of the Act provided as follows:
 
 
 
 '171(3) The provisions of Divisions 2 to 6 [referring to ss 176-316 of the Act] constitute the Australian Fair Pay and Conditions Standard ' 
 
 
 

22 The 2007 Agreement concluded with a page providing for execution for and on behalf of the employer and execution for and on behalf of the employees.
It commenced:
 
 'We hereby certify that we agree to the terms of the Karellas Pty Ltd Employee Collective Agreement 2007.
' 


 
23 In the space provided for execution of the 2007 Agreement by the employee representative the following words appeared:
 
 ' SIGNED FOR AND ON BEHALF OF THE EMPLOYEE/S 
 
 I, the undersigned, state that I am an Employee of the Employer and am proposed to be covered by this Agreement.
I counted the votes in a secret ballot of Employees in relation to the Agreement, and on this basis I state that a valid majority of Employees have made this Agreement.
' 


 The distinction between a contract of employment and an employee collective agreement 
 
24 The prevailing system of industrial regulation from time to time has allowed for individual contracts of employment between a given employer and a given employee to be underpinned in a variety of ways.
Firstly, there have been industrial awards, then there may have been pre-reform certified agreements and, more recently, workplace agreements.
In this case it is unnecessary to address the legal significance of an Australian workplace agreement between an employer and an employee which may have been executed by the employer and the employee in the manner for which s 340(1) of the Act provides.
25 The underpinning regime, as I have described it, does not require that the rights and obligations for which it provides should become contractual rights and obligations.
26 The interaction of pre-reform certified agreements with other instruments was dealt with in clause 5 of Schedule 7 to the Act as indicated above.
27 As also indicated above, clause 3(1) of Schedule 7 to the Act provided for pre-reform certified agreements to cease to be in operation in relation to an employee if, relevantly, a collective agreement came into operation in relation to that employee.
28 The 2007 Agreement came into operation on the day that the agreement was lodged with the Employment Advocate notwithstanding that the requirements of ss 334-342 of the Act may not have been met in relation to it.
29 Under s 349 of the Act an award has no effect in relation to an employee while a workplace agreement operates in relation to the employee.
30 In the case of an employee collective agreement the relevant statutory underpinning afforded to it is to be found in s 351 of the Act.
Under s 351(b), when in operation, such an agreement binds all persons whose employment is subject to the agreement, regardless of whether an individual employee cast a valid vote deciding that that employee did not want to approve the agreement or not and whether an individual employee was an employee of Karellas at the time when the 2007 Agreement came into operation.
31 In dealing with a situation where there was an award underpinning an individual contract of employment Brennan CJ, Dawson and Toohey JJ said in Byrne v Australian Airlines Limited [1995] HCA 24 ; (1995) 185 CLR 410 at 421:
 
 'In a system of industrial regulation where some, but not all, of the incidents of an employment relationship are determined by award, it is plainly unnecessary that the contract of employment should provide for those matters already covered by the award.
The contract may provide additional benefits, but cannot derogate from the terms and conditions imposed by the award and, ... the award operates with statutory force to secure those terms and conditions.
Neither from the point of view of the employer nor the employee is there any need to convert those statutory rights and obligations to contractual rights and obligations.
...' (footnote omitted) 


 
32 Earlier, their Honours explained at 420:
 
 'A right to the payment of award rates is imported by statute into the employment relationship, which is contractual in origin, and, express promise apart, it is only in that sense that it can be said that award rates are imported into the contract of employment.
The award regulates what would otherwise by governed by the contract.
But award rates are imported as a statutory right imposing a statutory obligation to pay them.
The importation of the statutory right into the employment relationship does not change the character of the right.
As Latham CJ points out in his judgment in Amalgamated Collieries of WA Ltd v True , the legal relations between the parties are in that situation determined in part by the contract and in part by the award.
And as the judgment of the Privy Council in that case suggests, a provision in an award may also be made a term of the contract by agreement between the parties, but that is only to emphasise the distinction between an obligation imported by statute and one arising by agreement.
' (footnote omitted) 


 
33 To like effect, Wilson J said in Ansett Transport Industries (Operations) Proprietary Limited v Wardley [1980] HCA 8 ; (1980) 142 CLR 237 at 287 --- 8:
 
 '...
It will be seldom ... that an award will lend itself to the "covering the field" test of inconsistency on the subject of the contract of employment.
Few, if any, awards reflect an intention to express completely, exhaustively or exclusively the law governing that contract between the parties.
It will generally be a case of specific provisions which will, of course, have the effect of rendering inoperative any provisions of subordinate law, whether common law or statutory, touching that employment with which they are inconsistent.
In Reg.
v Industrial Court of South Australia; Ex parte General Motors-Holden's Pty.
Ltd. Walters and Wells JJ., in a passage with which I respectfully agree, discuss the relationship of an award to the common law and to statute law and refer with approval to the following passage from Webb : Industrial Relations and the Contract of Employment ( 1974), p. 21: 
 
 
 
 "The significance of the common law can be recognised if contracts of employment are seen to be stratified.
First there is a foundation strata being the common law.
Superimposed on this are State Acts, regulations and State industrial determinations; in places such State law cuts through and replaces the common law foundational strata.
Above this again are Commonwealth Acts, regulations and awards of the Arbitration Commission.
Federal law cuts through State law in places, sometimes at the point where State law has already cut through common law, sometimes direct into common law.
" 
 
 
 
 Their Honours also refer, inter alia, to the remarks of Latham C.J. in Amalgamated Collieries of W.A.
Ltd. v True .
' (footnotes omitted)
 

34 In relation to a pre-reform certified agreement serving as an underpinning instrument, such a situation was considered by a Full Court of this Court in Quickenden v O'Connor [2001] FCA 303 ; (2001) 109 FCR 243.
At [69] Black CJ and French J said:
 
 'The broad brush complaint that common law contractual rights were displaced by the certified agreement faced another threshold issue.
For while the agreement bound Dr Quickenden by force of law, it did not thereby terminate his contract of employment.
It created rights and obligations which were statutory in character and could operate in addition to the rights and obligations under his contract and, where inconsistent, no doubt displace them.
There is nothing in the agreement however which expressly sets aside or displaces the terms of existing or common law rights generally.
The agreement itself is not, on the face of it, and is not expressed to be, exhaustive of the rights and duties of those bound by it.
If anything it focuses upon the rights of employees, rather than their obligations.
' 


 
35 In his reasons for judgment Carr J said at [131]:
 
 '... As the High Court of Australia explained in Byrne v Australian Airlines Ltd [1995] HCA 24 ; (1995) 185 CLR 410 at 420 --- 421 an award imposes certain statutory terms and conditions which do not necessarily displace underlying common law contractual relations.
If they conflict, the award or certified agreement may modify the contractual provisions, but otherwise they continue to co-exist.
Byrne involved an award, but there does not seem to be any relevant distinction, for present purposes, between an award and a certified agreement.
...' 


 
36 In the case of the 2007 Agreement it displaced a pre-reform certified agreement and provided what I have referred to as an 'underpinning' for the individual contracts of employment of Karellas' employees.
The alleged false or misleading statements 
 
37 The applicant's concerns in relation to the approval of the 2007 Agreement arise from two publications put around by Karellas in the period 19 --- 27 April 2007.
The first document is four pages in length.
It is on the letterhead of Karellas and addressed to 'Dear Employee'.
It is dated 19 April 2007.
On the second page it has been signed by a Peter Smith as 'Operations Manager'.
The second document is three pages in length.
It is also on the letterhead of Karellas and addressed to 'Dear Employee'.
It also bears the signature of Mr Smith as 'Operations Manager'.
It is undated.
Copies of the two documents are attached to these reasons for judgment as appendices 'A' and 'B' respectively.
38 The two documents were the subject of certain interrogatories administered by the applicant upon the respondent on 25 June 2007.
Verified answers to these interrogatories were provided on 26 July 2007.
Further verified answers were provided on 10 August 2007 which qualified the original answers.
The applicant was content to tender both sets of answers and to allow the respondent to have the benefit of the qualifications.
Relevantly, the answers provided establish that copies of the 19 April 2007 document were made available by the respondent to approximately 85 out of 85 employees at its Cremorne store and approximately 151 out of 151 employees at its Blaxland store 'in or about April 2007 and before 3.00 pm on 27 April 2007'.
It is agreed between the parties, and supported by the further verified answers, that notwithstanding the terms of the original answers, there were different versions of the four page document.
Depending on an employee's job classification, he or she received as part of the document a table of 'Examples of your new pay rates if the Proposed Agreement is approved by a valid majority of Employees' which may have been applicable to (say) 'Shop Assistant Casual --- 19 Years' or (say) 'Shop Assistant Casuals Adult'.
Somewhat curiously, one version of the document bears the manuscript date '20/4/07' against Mr Smith's signature and another version bears the manuscript date '19/7/07' (sic) against his signature.
39 The second (undated) document was made available to 65 of the employees of Karellas who worked at the Blaxland store between 4.30 pm on 26 April 2007 and 3.00 pm on 27 April 2007, by leaving copies of it in the 'Tea Room'.
Of those 65 employees, between five and ten were handed a copy personally.
No copies of it or parts of it were made available to the employees who worked at the Cremorne store.
Two copies of the document which are in evidence suggest that Mr Smith may have separately signed each individual copy of it.
40 On Friday 27 April 2007 an organiser employed by the New South Wales branch of the applicant had a discussion with Mr Vasilli Karellas, a director of Karellas at a coffee shop in or near to Cremorne.
During the course of the discussion Mr Vasilli Karellas said to the union organiser words to the effect of:
 
 '... we have circulated a letter this morning to all staff confirming that they will get a 5% wage increase.
' 


 
Mr Karellas proceeded to leave the union organiser at the coffee shop returning approximately five minutes later with a single page document which he handed to the union organiser.
The single page document was a copy of the first page of the three page (undated) document referred to above.
41 The applicant's case turns upon the four page document dated 19 April 2007 (the particular version being unimportant), the three page (undated) document and, so it was said, a conversation to which Ms Stringer deposed in her affidavit sworn 4 May 2007 with a Mr Chris Kable, whom she described as 'my immediate manager at IGA Blaxland'.
The relevant part of Ms Stringer's affidavit was as follows:
 
 
 '11 ...
In particular, I recall telling Mr Kable that, among other things, our rest breaks, overtime rates and Picnic Day were all removed from the Agreement.
In response to my concerns I recall Mr Kable telling me words to the effect of: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 "I don't think its legal to take meal breaks and rest breaks away from you.
I think they are staying as they are.
If you vote 'yes', you will still get your meal breaks and rest breaks.
"' 
 
 


 
42 No evidence has been provided to establish that Mr Kable had any relevant authority to make admissions in respect of the 2007 Agreement which would be binding on Karellas.
At the end of the day, the applicant withdrew its reliance upon the Stringer/Kable conversation.
Sections 340(2)(a) and 341(1) 
 
43 In relation to the alleged contravention of s 341(1) of the Act the applicant's case is that such approval as may have been given to the 2007 Agreement was not approval in accordance with s 340(2)(a) of the Act.
It was acknowledged that there had been compliance with what were described as the 'mechanical provisions' contained in s 340(2)(b).
44 Sections 340(2) and 341(1) relevantly provided:
 
 '340(2) An employee collective agreement ... is approved if: 
 
 
 (a) the employer has given all of the persons employed at the time whose employment will be subject to the agreement a reasonable opportunity to decide whether they want to approve the agreement; and 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (b) either: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (i) if the decision is made by a vote --- a majority of those persons who cast a valid vote decide that they want to approve the agreement; or 
 
 (ii) otherwise --- a majority of those persons decide that they want to approve the agreement.

 
 
 341(1) An employer contravenes this subsection if: 
 
 
 
 
 (a) the employer lodges a workplace agreement ...; and 
 
 
 
 
 (b) the agreement has not been approved in accordance with section 340.

 ...' 


 
45 The applicant contends that if a publication is put around by an employer within a week or so before a vote by employees is taken on whether to approve or disapprove an employee collective agreement, and that publication contains representations which are false or misleading and are likely to materially influence a decision one way or the other, then the employer will not have 'given all of the persons employed at the time whose employment will be subject to the agreement a reasonable opportunity to decide whether they want to approve the agreement' within the meaning of s 340(2)(a) of the Act.
46 A short chronology referable to the period 19 April --- 1 May 2007 appears hereunder:
 
 19 April 2007 Karellas first put around the various versions of the four page document
 
 21 April 2007 Ms Stringer was handed her copy of the 19 April document by Mr Kable
 
 26-27 April 2007 Copies of the three page document were made available to employees working at the Blaxland store
 
 28 April 2007 Ms Stringer took a copy of the three page document from the Blaxland store tearoom
 
 27 -30 April 2007 Employees at the Cremorne and Blaxland stores voted by secret ballot on the approval/non-approval of the 2007 Agreement
 
 30 April 2007 Ms Stringer voted on the approval/non-approval of the 2007 Agreement at the Blaxland store
 
 30 April 2007 7.00 pm a notice was posted inside the Blaxland store tearoom with words to the effect 'The Workplace Agreement has been approved by a majority of employees'
 
47 In respect of the 78 employees at the Cremorne store who cast a valid vote, 70 voted to approve the employee collective agreement and 8 voted against approval.
The evidence does not establish what the outcome of the vote was at the Blaxland store.
48 The applicant submits that, by making the false or misleading statements upon which it relies in the four page document dated 19 April 2007 and the (undated) three page document, Karellas deprived persons employed at the time, whose employment would be subject to the 2007 Agreement, of a 'reasonable opportunity to decide' whether they wanted to approve the agreement.
49 It seems to me that if the minds of the relevant employees were or were likely to be contaminated by misinformation about the 2007 Agreement and its effect then it could be said that such employees were denied a 'reasonable opportunity to decide' whether they wanted to approve it.
In the absence of any evidence whatsoever as to the effect of any of the matters of alleged misinformation on the minds of any of Karellas' employees, the likely effect of such alleged misinformation has to be considered.
50 The giving of a reasonable opportunity to decide for which s 340(2)(a) provides, is not simply concerned with timeliness of information or access to the relevant employee collective agreement.
Timeliness is covered by s 337 which relevantly provided:
 
 
 
 '337(1) If an employer intends to have a workplace agreement ... approved under section 340, the employer must take reasonable steps to ensure that all eligible employees in relation to the agreement either have, or have ready access to, the agreement in writing during the period: 
 
 
 
 
 
 (a) beginning 7 days before the agreement is approved; and 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (b) ending when the agreement is approved.

 
 
 
 
 
 (2) The employer must take reasonable steps to ensure that all eligible employees in relation to the agreement are given an information statement at least 7 days before the agreement is approved.

 
 
 
 ... 
 
 
 
 
 (4) The information statement mentioned in subsection (2) ... must contain: 
 
 
 
 
 
 (a) information about the time at which and the manner in which the approval will be sought under section 340; and 
 
 
 
 ... 
 
 
 
 
 (c) if the agreement is an employee collective agreement --- information about the effect of section 335 ... 
 
 
 
 ... 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (8) An employer contravenes this subsection if: 
 
 
 
 
 
 (a) the employer lodges a workplace agreement; and 
 
 
 
 (b) the employer failed to comply with subsection (1) ... in relation to the agreement; 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (9) An employer contravenes this subsection if: 
 
 
 
 
 
 (a) the employer lodges a workplace agreement; and 
 
 
 
 
 
 (b) the employer failed to comply with subsection (2) or (if applicable) paragraph (3)(a) in relation to the agreement.

 
 
 
 ...' 
 
 
 
 
 
 

51 It may be observed that there is nothing in the relevant Ministers' Second Reading Speeches or any Explanatory Memorandum to indicate what may have been intended by the use of the phrase 'a reasonable opportunity to decide' within the meaning of s 340(2)(a) of the Act.
52 The respondent submits that a seeming failure to comply with s 340(2)(a) may be ignored, in the absence of evidence that the employer's failure to give all of the persons employed at the time whose employment would be subject to the relevant employee collective agreement a reasonable opportunity to decide whether they wanted to approve the agreement or not caused a person so employed to cast a vote in favour of approval of the agreement which, had they been given a reasonable opportunity to decide, they would not have cast in that way.
53 I am unable to discern any such requirement from the words of s 340(2) of the Act, whether viewed on their own or in the context of the other provisions of Division 5 of Part 8.
54 Undoubtedly, a judgment as to whether or not 'a reasonable opportunity to decide' has been given will require consideration of the likely effect that misinformation, given by an employer, may have upon an employee's decision to vote one way or another.
A trivial misstatement in a document put around by an employer could hardly amount to a failure by the employer to give all of the persons employed at the time whose employment would be subject to the proposed employee collective agreement a reasonable opportunity to decide whether they wanted to approve the agreement or not.
55 In my opinion the ultimate consequence that may flow from the failure by an employer to give 'a reasonable opportunity to decide' is an irrelevant consideration.
Whether an employer has or has not given all of the persons employed at the time whose employment would be the subject to the agreement a reasonable opportunity to decide whether they wanted to approve the agreement or not should be capable of being determined immediately prior to the ballot at which votes may be cast one way or the other.
56 It seems to me that there is some force in the respondent's submission in this case to the effect that judgment on the question of whether Karellas gave all of the persons employed at the time whose employment would be subject to the proposed employee collective agreement a reasonable opportunity to decide whether they wanted to approve the agreement or not, should have regard to the lack of any evidence whatsoever from employees expressing dissatisfaction with the outcome that was secured as a result of a majority of those persons casting valid votes that they wanted to approve the 2007 Agreement.
57 That, however, is not the end of the matter.
The applicant has identified numerous representations said to have been made by Karellas in the documents which it put around, which the applicant submits were false.
The representations upon which the applicant relies were as follows:
