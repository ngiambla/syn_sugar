 
1 The appellant appeals the whole of the orders made by the Federal Magistrates Court on 8 February 2007.
The federal magistrate had dismissed the appellant's application to set aside a bankruptcy notice dated 3 November 2006 ('the Notice') in respect of a debt (inclusive of interest) of $619,757.22.
2 The issue in this appeal concerns the manner in which the Notice was completed in respect of the calculation of interest.
The appellant argued that the respondent failed to comply with the requirements of the prescribed form because the Notice contained no statement of the principal sum, the period, or the interest rate or rates at which the interest had been claimed by the respondent.
3 The background to the incurring of the judgment debt and the claim for interest is as follows.
On 12 June 2003, Master Wheeler of the Supreme Court of Victoria entered judgment against the appellant in favour of the respondent in the sum of $569,589.65 in proceeding number 6302 of 2000 ('the 2003 Orders').
4 In proceeding number 5407 of 2005, Whelan J of the Supreme Court of Victoria made orders on 31 October 2006 ('the 2006 Orders') in the following terms: 
 
 (1) The Court declares that the judgment obtained by the plaintiff in proceeding number 6302 of 2000 remains enforceable and that the sum of $619,757.22 remains outstanding as at 11 October 2006 pursuant to the said judgment.

 
 (2) There is no order as to costs in relation to all aspects of the proceeding not already the subject of a costs order, including the costs of the amendments made during the trial which but for this order would be dealt with by Rule 63.17.


5 On 3 November 2006, the Notice was issued and on 16 November 2006, it was served on the appellant.
On 5 December 2006, the appellant applied to the Federal Magistrates Court to set aside the Notice.
6 It is convenient to set out the relevant part of the Notice:

 FOR INFORMATION OF THE CREDITOR - Notes to the Schedule 
 
 Note 1 : Legal costs (item 2 of the Schedule) 
 If legal costs are being claimed in this Bankruptcy Notice, a certificate of taxed or assessed costs in support of the amount claimed must be attached to this Bankruptcy Notice.

 
 Note 2 : Interest accrued (item 3 of the Schedule) 
 If interest is being claimed in this Bankruptcy Notice, details of the calculation of the amount of interest claimed are to be set out in a document attached to this Bankruptcy Notice.
The document must state: 
 a. the provision under which the interest is being claimed; and 
 
 
 
 b. the principal sum on which, the period for which, and the interest rate or rates at which, the interest is being claimed.

 
 
 
 (NB: If different rates are claimed for different periods, full details must be shown) 

7 The calculation of the interest claimed in item 3 of the schedule was set out by the respondent in a document attached to the Notice in the following terms: 
 
 CALCULATION OF INTEREST CLAIMED IN ITEM 3 OF THE SCHEDULE 
 
 Interest is claimed pursuant to Section 101(1) of the Supreme Court Act 1986 which provides: 
 
 
 
 "Every judgment debt carries interest at the rate for the time being fixed under Section 2 of the Penalty Interest Rates Act 1983 from the time the judgement was given.
"
 
 
 
 By an order made by the Honourable Justice Whelan in the Supreme Court of Victoria, in proceeding number 5407 of 2005 the court declared that the judgement in proceeding 6302 of 2000 remains enforceable and that the sum of $619,757.22 remains outstanding.

 The sum of $619,757.22 includes interest in the sum of $190,167.57 pursuant to the Penalty Interest Rates Act 1983 .


8 Annexed to the Notice were the 2003 Orders and 2006 Orders.
As indicated above, the 2006 Orders included a declaration of the debt owing by the appellant to the respondent as at 11 October 2006 inclusive of interest, being the sum of $619,757.22.
It was not disputed that the declaration of Whelan J was binding on the parties.
It would appear that the amount of interest was in fact agreed between the parties in the proceeding before Whelan J, as was noted by the federal magistrate (at [8]):
 
 In this case the respondent has not produced a schedule explaining how the figure set out in the declaration by Whelan J was calculated.
Indeed, it appears that Whelan J reached that figure as a result of admissions made in the pleadings (the respondent alleged that the judgment debt together with interest as at 12 October 2006 was the sum of $619,757.22, and this allegation was admitted by the applicant in the defence).
There is now some dispute as to whether or not this figure is calculated precisely in accord with the relevant statutory provisions that apply to judgments of this type in Victoria.
However, it is conceded that the declaration of Whelan J is binding.
There has been no appeal, nor is it sought to look behind that judgment.


Neither party contended before me that these observations of his Honour were inaccurate.
LEGISLATION 
 
9 It is convenient to set out the relevant statutory context.
Section 40(1) of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth) ('the Act') so far as is relevant, provides:
 
 A debtor commits an act of bankruptcy in each of the following cases: 
 ... 
 
 
 
 (g) if a creditor who has obtained against the debtor a final judgment or final order, being a judgment or order the execution of which has not been stayed, has served on the debtor in Australia or, by leave of the Court, elsewhere, a bankruptcy notice under this Act and the debtor does not: 
 
 
 
 (i) where the notice was served in Australia - within the time specified in the notice; or 
 (ii) where the notice was served elsewhere - within the time fixed for the purpose by the order giving leave to effect the service; 
 
 
 
 comply with the requirements of the notice or satisfy the Court that he or she has a counter-claim, set-off or cross demand equal to or exceeding the amount of the judgment debt or sum payable under the final order, as the case may be, being a counter-claim, set-off or cross demand that he or she could not have set up in the action or proceeding in which the judgment or order was obtained; 
 
 

10 Section 41 of the Act, so far as is relevant, provides: 
 
 (1) An Official Receiver may issue a bankruptcy notice on the application of a creditor who has obtained against a debtor: 
 (a) a final judgment or final order that: 
 
 (i) is of the kind described in paragraph 40(1)(g); and 
 (ii) is for an amount of at least $2,000; or 
 
 (b) 2 or more final judgments or final orders that: 
 
 
 
 (i) are of the kind described in paragraph 40(1)(g); and 
 (ii) taken together are for an amount of at least $2,000.

 
 
 
 
 
 (2) The notice must be in accordance with the form prescribed by the regulations.

 
 
 
 (3) A bankruptcy notice shall not be issued in relation to a debtor: 
 
 
 
 (a) except on the application of a creditor who has obtained against the debtor a final judgment or final order within the meaning of paragraph 40(1)(g) or a person who, by virtue of paragraph 40(3)(d), is to be deemed to be such a creditor; 
 ... 
 
 

11 Regulation 4.02 of the Bankruptcy Regulations 1996 (Cth) ('the Regulations') provides:
 
 
 (1) For the purposes of subsection 41(2) of the Act, the form of bankruptcy notice set out in Form 1 is prescribed.

 
 (2) A bankruptcy notice must follow Form 1 in respect of its format (for example, bold or italic typeface, underlining and notes).

 
 
 
 
 
 (3) Subregulation (2) is not to be taken as expressing an intention contrary to s 25C of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 .

 

12 Section 25C of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 (Cth) ('the Acts Interpretation Act ') provides:
 
 Where an Act prescribes a form, then, unless the contrary intention appears, strict compliance with the form is not required and substantial compliance is sufficient.


13 Section 306(1) of the Act provides:
 
 Proceedings under this Act are not invalidated by a formal defect or an irregularity, unless the court before which the objection on that ground is made is of opinion that substantial injustice has been caused by the defect or irregularity and that the injustice cannot be remedied by an order of that court.

 CONSIDERATION 
 
14 In order to determine the issues in this appeal, it is useful to refer to the recent decision of Snelgrove v Roskell (2007) 157 FCR 313.
In that case, Jacobson J considered whether an incorrect reference to the legislation, which was the statutory source of post-judgment interest claimed in the bankruptcy notice, resulted in the bankruptcy notice being invalid.
In determining the correct principles to apply, his Honour held (at [29]-[31]):
 
 The High Court said in Adams [ v Lambert (2006)] [2006] HCA 10 ; 225 ALR 396 at [18] that if there is a failure to comply with a provision of the Act or the Bankruptcy Regulations 1996 Cth (the Regulations), the first question which must be asked is whether the defect or irregularity is a formal one within the purview of s 306.
If it is, it is then necessary to ask whether substantial injustice has been caused by the defect or irregularity and whether the injustice cannot be remedied by an order of the Court.
It must be borne in mind that these are separate and distinct questions.

 
 The first question, that is, whether the defect or irregularity is formal, involves two levels of enquiry.
These were stated by an earlier decision of the High Court in Kleinwort Benson Australia Ltd v Crowl [1988] HCA 34 ; (1988) 165 CLR 71, and applied in Adams [2006] HCA 10 ; 225 ALR 396 at [25] ff.

 
 The relevant enquiry is: does the bankruptcy notice fail to meet a requirement made essential by the Act or the Regulations; or could it reasonably mislead a debtor as to what is necessary to comply with the notice; see Kleinwort Benson 165 CLR at 79; Adams 225 ALR 396 at [25].


15 Apart from the reference to the Regulations in the last paragraph (to which see Gyles J at [113] in The Australian Steel Company (Operations) Pty Ltd v Lewis [2000] FCA 1915 ; (2000) 109 FCR 33 referred to later which correctly indicates that the task is to focus on the Act not the Regulations), in my view Jacobson J correctly states the matters relevant to the inquiry whether the defect or irregularity in the Notice is a formal defect or an irregularity.
16 However, a preliminary matter to consider is whether the Notice was defective or irregular in any event by reason of a failure to include an interest calculation in accordance with note 2, having regard to the circumstances of this case and to the operation of s 25C of the Acts Interpretation Act .
This preliminary matter was raised by the respondent, the federal magistrate having found, in favour of the appellant, that there was a relevant defect or irregularity in the Notice.
17 If there was such a defect or irregularity, then the only remaining issue that I have been asked to determine is whether the Notice failed to meet a requirement made essential by the Act.
The appellant did not contend that the failure to include an interest calculation could reasonably mislead a debtor as to what was necessary to comply with the Notice, but said that this was not relevant to determining whether there was a failure to comply with a requirement made essential by the Act.
I agree.
The relevant inquiry as described by Jacobson J consists of two aspects, which need to be addressed separately, and to the extent the federal magistrate treated both aspects together, in my respectful view he fell into error.
18 However, I turn first to the preliminary matter as to whether the Notice substantially complied with the requirements of the form prescribed by the Regulations.
In my view, the Notice does provide an equivalent to the required details of the calculation of the interest claimed as is necessary and prescribed, in the unusual circumstances surrounding the Notice.
