 INTRODUCTION 
 
1 The applicants (other than South Johnstone Mill Limited ('the Company')) seek leave to continue this proceeding on behalf of and in the name of the Company under s 237 of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) ('the Act'), seeking injunctive relief and damages for contravention of various sections of the Act and damages on other grounds in respect of the sale of the Company's milling assets.
For the purposes of this application for leave, I will proceed on the basis that the Company has available to it potential claims against the first respondents ('the Receivers') for contravention of the duties imposed upon officers of a corporation by s 180 of the Act, for breach of the obligation imposed upon a controller of property of a corporation by s 420A of the Act, and for breach of an equitable duty to act in good faith.
Other claims are made which may or may not be properly maintained as a matter of law (at least as currently pleaded), but it is apparent that if the applicants cannot succeed in respect of the claims referred to above, then they could not otherwise be successful in respect of other claims on the evidence sought to be relied upon in this application.
The basis of the claim against the second respondent ('the Bank') is that the Bank is liable for the defaults of the Receivers because the Receivers were acting as agents of the Bank.
2 Although the applicants do not expressly state so in their application, it seems clear that the order sought is the grant of leave nunc pro tunc from at least the date proceedings were filed on 20 February 2007.
Whilst the position as to the relevant limitation period is not entirely clear (both as a matter of law and fact), the applicants want to secure such leave so that no limitation defence can be raised by the respondents.
I will proceed on the basis that the expiration of any relevant limitation period is six years after 21 February 2001, and that if leave is not granted nunc pro tunc , the applicants will at least be at risk of a limitation defence being raised by the respondents.
