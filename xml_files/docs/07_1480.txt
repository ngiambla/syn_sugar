 INTRODUCTION 
 
 1 Centennial Hunter Pty Limited, the second respondent in this proceeding proposes to construct and operate an open-cut coal mine and ancillary facilities, known as the Anvil Hill Project, at Anvil Hill in the Hunter Valley, New South Wales.
On 11 January 2007, pursuant to s 68 of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (Cth) (the Act), Centennial referred the project to the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources, the first respondent in this proceeding, for a determination as to whether the project is a "controlled action" within the meaning of s 67 of the Act.
On 19 February 2007, a delegate of the Minister decided that the project was not a controlled action which meant that the project could proceed without further approval being required under the Act.
2 On 17 May 2007, the applicant, the Anvil Hill Project Watch Association, filed an application under s 5 of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 (Cth) ( ADJR Act ) for an order of review of the delegate's determination that the Anvil Hill Project is not a controlled action.
The applicant is an association incorporated in Australia on 21 June 2000.
Since that time it has engaged in a series of activities in Australia for the protection of the environment.
Its objects at the time of the delegate's decision included protection of the environment.
By virtue of these objects and activities, by the application of s 487 of the Act , the applicant falls within the extended meaning of "person aggrieved" for the purposes of s 5 of the ADJR Act and thus has standing to bring this application.
The extended standing accorded under s 487 is an indication of the importance the legislature attached to the involvement and input of concerned members of the community --- an importance that reflects the objects set out in s 3 of the Act.

 THE STATUTORY SCHEME 
 
 3 The applicant's submissions laid much stress on the objects of the Act and the scheme that the Act sets up to give effect to those actions.
It is therefore necessary to consider the statutory provisions in some detail.

 The objects of the Act 
 
 4 The objects of the Act are set out in s 3(1): 
 
 
 (a) to provide for the protection of the environment, especially those aspects of the environment that are matters of national environmental significance; and 
 (b) to promote ecologically sustainable development through the conservation and ecologically sustainable use of natural resources; and 
 (c) to promote the conservation of biodiversity; and 
 (ca) to provide for the protection and conservation of heritage; and 
 (d) to promote a co-operative approach to the protection and management of the environment involving governments, the community, land-holders and indigenous peoples; and 
 (e) to assist in the co-operative implementation of Australia's international environmental responsibilities; and 
 (f) to recognise the role of indigenous people in the conservation and ecologically sustainable use of Australia's biodiversity; and 
 (g) to promote the use of indigenous peoples' knowledge of biodiversity with the involvement of, and in co-operation with, the owners of the knowledge.

 
 
 5 Those objects are to be achieved by various means including by intergovernmental co-operation as set out in s 3(2)(a)-(d): 
 (2) In order to achieve its objects, the Act: 
 
 
 
 
 (a) recognises an appropriate role for the Commonwealth in relation to the environment by focussing Commonwealth involvement on matters of national environment significance and on Commonwealth actions and Commonwealth areas; and 
 
 (b) strengthens intergovernmental co-operation, and minimises duplication, through bilateral agreements; and 
 
 (c) provides for the intergovernmental accreditation of environmental assessment and approval processes; and 
 
 (d) adopts an efficient and timely Commonwealth environmental assessment and approval process that will ensure activities that are likely to have significant impacts on the environment are properly assessed; ... 
 
 
 
 
 6 Importantly, s 3A sets out principles of ecologically sustainable development that are relevant to decision makers under the Act.
Those principles incorporate concern for long and short term "economic, environmental, social and equitable considerations".
They direct attention to inter-generational equity, the conservation of biological diversity and ecological integrity as well as the need to balance levels of scientific certainty with the seriousness of an environmental threat.
The section advocates the promotion of incentive mechanisms in the management of environmental issues.

 Restriction of proposed actions 
 
 7 Section 523 of the Act defines an "action" as including a project, development or undertaking and an activity or series of activities.
Part 3 of the Act prohibits actions which will have or are likely to have a significant impact on matters of national environmental significance including world heritage property, wetlands of international significance, threatened and migratory species and the marine environment.
Civil and criminal penalties are provided in respect of prohibited actions.
8 An action that is prohibited by a provision of Part 3 is called a controlled action; s 67.
The provision that prohibits a controlled action is called the "controlling provision".
There are some exemptions to the prohibitions such as where "there is in force a decision of the Minister under Division 2 of Part 7" that the section imposing the prohibition is "not a controlling provision for the action" and, in the case of a controlled action, where there is an operative approval under Part 9.
Section 67A provides that a person must not take a controlled action unless "an approval of the taking of the action by the person is in operation under Part 9 for the purposes of the relevant provision of Part 3".

 Minister may be asked to determine if action is a controlled action 
 
 9 No approval is required if the proposed action is not a controlled action.
Obviously, however, this characterisation of an action is a matter of judgment and the consequences of wrongly assuming that the proposed action is not a controlled action are severe.
A person proposing to take such an action may take the cautious approach and, pursuant to s 68, refer the proposal to the Minister for a decision on the issue even if he or she thinks it is not a controlled action.
Referral under s 68 is obligatory if the person thinks the action is or may be a controlled action; s 68(1).
Section 70 provides that the Minister may request that the referral of a proposal that he or she thinks may be a controlled action.
As the note to s 70 points out:
 If the proposal to take the action is not referred, the person cannot get an approval under Part 9 to take the action.
If taking the action without approval contravenes Part 3 an injunction could be sought to prevent or stop the action, or the person could be ordered to pay a pecuniary penalty.

 10 If the Minister decides that the proposal that is the subject of the referral does not involve a controlled action then the prohibitions under Part 3 of the Act do not apply to that action; see, for example, ss 12(2)(c) and 15A(4)(c).
The protection that flows from a decision of the Minister relates more specifically to the decision that none of the provisions of Part 3 is a controlling provision.
Where the decision that a provision of Part 3 is not a controlling provision was made because the Minister believed that the action would be taken in a manner specified in the notice of the decision give under s 77, the protection only applies if the action is taken in that manner.

 Referred proposals 
 
 11 The Minister must decide if an action which is the subject of a referred proposal is a controlled action and, is so, which provisions of Part 3 of the Act are the controlling provisions for that action; s 75(1).
In making this decision the Minister must consider any comments received from the public; s 75(1A).
If it is relevant to the Minister's decision to consider the impact of an action then he or she is obliged to consider all adverse impacts that the action has, will have or is likely to have, "on the matter protected by each provision of Part 3" and must not consider any beneficial impacts; s 75(2).
The term "impact" is defined in s 527E which was introduced into the Act on 19 February 2007, which is the date of the delegate's decision made under s 75(1).
Prior to that date the term was not defined in the Act.
The parties have not raised any issue in respect of the definition in relation to the second respondent's proposed action.
12 The Minister must inform other Commonwealth Ministers who may have relevant administrative responsibilities about proposal that has been referred and invite information and comments from them; s 74(1).
Section 74(2) makes similar provision for inviting comments from the appropriate State or Territory Minister on whether the proposed action is a controlled action, if the Minister thinks the proposal relates to matters of national environment significance.
Subsection (3) provides that the Minister must also invite public comment.
If Minister "believes on reasonable grounds" that the referral does not include enough information for the Minister to make a decision under s 75(1), he or she may also request more information from the person proposing to take the action; s 76.
13 The Minister may revoke a decision made under s 75(1) and substitute a new decision in certain specified circumstances including, in ss 78(1)(a) and (aa), if the Minister is satisfied that this is warranted by substantial new information about the impacts that the action has, will have or is likely to have on a matter protected under Part 3.
The detailed specification in ss 78(1)(b), (ba), (c) and (ca) of the circumstances in which the power may be exercised focus on an earlier decision that the action was not a controlled action.
Subsections 78(1)(a) and (aa) are not so confined and would appear to give the Minister power to reverse a decision that an action is a controlled action.
14 The Act provides for a decision that an action is not a controlled action to be carefully tailored to the manner in which the action is to be taken.
Where the decision is based on the Minister's belief that the action will be taken in a particular manner the notice of the Minister's decision provided under s 77 must specify the manner in which the action is to be taken; s 77A(1) and the action must not be taken in an inconsistent manner; s 77A(2).
15 A decision that a proposed action is a controlled action triggers an assessment of the impact of controlled actions under Part 8 of the Act that must be made before the Minister decides whether to approve the action in accordance with Part 9; see s 133.
Section 87 provides six methods of assessment.
Without going into detail it is sufficient to say that these assessments involve closer scrutiny of the proposal than is required to that point.
The Minister must also balance the negative effect of the proposed action against any positive benefits the proposal may have.
16 Part 8 does not apply to an action where there is bilateral agreement between the Commonwealth and the State or self-governing Territory in which the action is to be taken, and the agreement declares that the class of actions to which the proposed action belongs does not need to be assessed under Part 8.
According to the applicant there is an assessment bilateral agreement in force for New South Wales but it was not used in relation to the Anvil Hill Project.
This issue was not in contention.

 REFERRAL OF THE ANVIL HILL MINING PROJECT TO THE MINISTER 
 The written referral 
 
 17 On 11 January 2007, Unwelt (Australia) Pty Limited referred Centennial's proposal for a coal mine at Anvil Hill to the Minister to determine if the project is a controlled action within s 67 of the Act.
Centennial is the person proposing to take the action.
The referral stated that in Centennial's view the proposed action was not a controlled action.
The written referral described the project as follows:
 Centennial Hunter Pty Limited ... proposes to establish an open cut coal mine and ancillary facilities including a coal preparation plant ... and rail loop.
The proposal, known as the Anvil Hill Project ... is based on a large, undeveloped coal reserve of approximately 150 million tonnes ... that is suitable for production of thermal coal for both domestic and export markets.
It is proposed to mine up to 10.5 million tonnes of run of mine ... coal per annum using truck and shovel methods.
