A considerable body of evidence has been filed on each side and I have had the benefit of comprehensive written and oral submissions from counsel.
I will not endeavour to reproduce or deal with all of those submissions.
As this is an interlocutory application, in giving these reasons I will assume a knowledge of the nature of the case and of the evidence filed on this motion.
As I am the docket judge, I will not say more about the issues which will fall for determination on the final hearing than is necessary to explain my reasons for coming to the view that an interlocutory injunction should be granted.
2 What is the general approach to the grant of an interlocutory injunction to restrain the infringement of a patent?
In Beecham Group Limited v Bristol Laboratories Pty Ltd [1968] HCA 1 ; (1968) 118 CLR 618 the High Court laid down this approach to the grant of an interlocutory injunction --- there are two inquiries: the first is whether the plaintiff has made out a prima facie case in the sense outlined, and the second is as to the balance of convenience.
That case also happened to be a patent case.
However it was, as the High Court said (118 CLR at 623---624):
 
 "not complicated by the special considerations which generally arise in a patent action where there is a substantial issue to be tried as to the validity of the patent.
In such an action the plaintiff's prima facie case must be a strong one so far as the question of validity is concerned, for he asserts a monopoly and must give more proof of the right he claims than as afforded by the mere granting of the patent ...
The general practice in that kind of case has long been to refuse an interlocutory injunction unless either the patent has already been judicially held to be valid or it has stood unchallenged for a long period".

 

In the result, the decision of McTiernan J to decline an interlocutory injunction was reversed.
3 Then in 1975 the House of Lords in American-Cyanamid Co v Ethicon Ltd [1975] UKHL 1 ; [1975] AC 396 considered the principles in relation to the grant of an interlocutory injunction restraining infringement of a patent.
The first inquiry was whether there was a serious question to be tried described in terms that seemed to set the bar fairly low.
Again, the refusal of a lower court to grant an injunction was reversed.
4 There was much discussion occasioned by the apparent difference in approach between those two decisions.
The most influential consideration of the issue in relation to patents was that by Gummow J in Martin Engineering Co v Trison Holdings Pty Ltd (1988) 81 ALR 543.
In the course of that judgment his Honour pointed out that the authorities referred to by the High Court in Beecham Group [1968] HCA 1 ; 118 CLR 618 for not attributing great significance to the grant of a patent were old cases from England based upon a different system for grant than that which had developed in Australia by that time.
The system of examination of patents prior to grant in Australia was more stringent than had been the case in England the century before.
The practical effect of this decision was to give greater weight to the grant of a patent thereafter than might have been deduced from Beecham Group [1968] HCA 1 ; 118 CLR 618.
5 Counsel for GenRx submits that that analysis is weakened, if not eliminated, by the type of examination prior to grant discussed in F Hoffman-La Roche AG v New England Biolabs Inc [2000] FCA 283 ; (2000) 50 IPR 305 especially at [48]---[57].
In my opinion, that decision is controversial.
Even if correct, however, it does not detract from the proposition that the Commissioner is charged with the responsibility of examining the validity of a patent before grant, including any relevant question of anticipation or lack of novelty.
6 Counsel for GenRx also submits that the authority of Beecham Group [1968] HCA 1 ; 118 CLR 618 has been fully restored by the decision of the High Court in Australian Broadcasting Corporation v O'Neill (2006) 227 CLR 57, particularly per Gleeson CJ and Crennan J at [19] and Gummow and Hayne JJ at [65]---[72].
However, this reaffirmation of Beecham Group [1968] HCA 1 ; 118 CLR 618 lies in the explanation of what is involved in establishing a prima facie case rather than any consideration of the application of the principles to patent infringement.
It would be surprising if Gummow J had joined in an exercise which would effectively overrule Martin Engineering 81 ALR 543 without any acknowledgement of that.
I propose to direct myself in accordance with Beecham Group [1968] HCA 1 ; 118 CLR 618 as it is explained by both Martin Engineering 81 ALR 543 and O'Neill 227 CLR 57.
7 It is accepted for present purposes that GenRx threatens to import and sell clopidogrel bisulphate products which come within claims 1, 3, 10 and 11 of the patent in suit.
8 I am satisfied that there is a substantial issue to be tried as to the validity of the patent on the ground that the claims of the patent are not novel over the first Canadian patent.
I do not agree that that issue can be simply disposed of by reference to the decision of the House of Lords in EI Du Pont De Nemours  Co (Witsiepe's) Application [1982] FSR 303, at least not without much closer examination of the issue than is appropriate on an interlocutory application.
At the very least, the statement in the Canadian specification "the invention also concerns each of the enantiomers and their mixture", the formula for the compound example 1, and the statements in claim 1 "as well as the 2 enantiomers or their mixture of these compounds of formula (I)" and "and, if desired, its enantiomers are separated and/or it is salified by mineral or organic acid action", give substance to the claim of invalidity by GenRx.
It is not necessary to consider other points of invalidity that will arise on the hearing.
9 However, in my opinion, the combination of the longstanding existence and exploitation of the patent in suit together with the failure of GenRx to bring revocation proceedings in a timely fashion are factors pointing to the appropriateness of the grant of an injunction.
The survival of similar patents from challenge in proceedings in both Canada and the United States points in the same direction, although not too much can be made of this because it is at least arguable that the approach of the courts in those places differs from the approach of the courts in Australia and there are differences in the framing of the patent, particularly in the United States.
