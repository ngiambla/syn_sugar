 
 Introduction and overview 
 
1 Mr Behrouz Foroughi is a problem gambler.
According to expert evidence called on his behalf, he is also a pathological gambler, although this diagnosis is disputed by an expert called by the respondent, Star City Pty Limited.
2 On 17 May 2004 and 18 May 2004, Mr Foroughi suffered substantial losses while playing roulette at Melbourne's Crown Casino and at Star City's casino at Pyrmont.
Following his losses on 18 May 2004, Mr Foroughi requested that Star City ban him from the casino.
Provision is made in s 79(3) of the Casino Control Act 1992 (NSW) for a casino operator to give an order, known as a voluntary exclusion order, made on the person's voluntary application, prohibiting the person from entering or remaining in a casino.
Star City made such an order against Mr Foroughi on 18 May 2004.
3 Mr Foroughi's voluntary exclusion order was made on a form of application signed by him and witnessed by an employee of Star City.
He stated in the application that he recognised that it was his responsibility not to enter the gaming areas and he undertook not to do so.
He also undertook to seek assistance and advice from a qualified counsellor in problem gaming.
He sought no such assistance until he consulted a solicitor in connection with the commencement of these proceedings.
4 Notwithstanding his express undertakings, Mr Foroughi claims to have entered Star City's casino on 65 occasions between June 2004 and January 2006 and to have suffered gambling losses on those occasions amounting to many hundreds of thousands of dollars.
He now seeks to recover his claimed losses from Star City under various causes of action.
5 On all occasions on which Mr Foroughi entered the gaming areas of Star City after 18 May 2004, he did so in knowing breach of the terms of his voluntary exclusion order.
His claims for damages are contrary to the principle of individual autonomy which underlies the common law's view as to the limits of legal responsibility for pure economic loss: see for example Reynolds v Katoomba RSL All Services Club Ltd [2001] NSWCA 234 ; (2001) 53 NSWLR 43 at [48] --- [49].
6 Nevertheless, Mr Foroughi asserts that Star City owed him a duty of care, the content of which is not entirely clear, but which appears to have been to take reasonable steps to prevent him from entering the gaming areas of the casino and/or to remove him from the casino.
Mr Foroughi also contends that express misleading representations, said to be in trade or commerce, were made to him by an employee of Star City when he was being escorted from the casino after the voluntary exclusion order was made.
