 INTRODUCTION 
 
1 On 31 October 2003 and 30 January 2004 respectively, the second to fifth respondents broadcast two episodes of the current affairs television program "Today Tonight" ('the Episodes').
The Episodes relevantly reported on a "mentoring program" for women, the Wildly Wealthy Women Millionaire Mentoring Program ('the Mentoring Program').
The creators of the Mentoring Program are Dymphna Boholt and Sandra Forster, the six and seventh respondents.
The Mentoring Program is promoted on a website (www.wildlywealthywomen.com) ('the Website') by the eighth respondent ('Universal').
2 The Episodes described Ms Boholt and Ms Forster (together, 'the women') as ' self proclaimed wildly wealthy women on a mission to make other women filthy rich ' through participation in the Mentoring Program.
Viewers were exhorted to log onto the Website '[f] or your chance to learn how to be a property millionaire '.
In recognition of the possibility that the Mentoring Program was ' too good to be true ', Today Tonight ' introduced [Ms Boholt and Ms Forster] to a couple of everyday Australians ' and promised to follow the scheme's progress ' to see if they actually become wildly wealthy women '.
3 For the purposes of this judgment, the first respondent shall be referred to as 'Seven Network', the second to fifth respondents shall be referred to as 'the Seven Licensees' and jointly those parties shall be referred to as 'Seven'.
At issue is whether the Seven Licensees have contravened the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) ('the Act') in the course of broadcasting the Episodes and whether the Seven Network is liable for any such contravention.
The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission ('the Commission') alleges that in the course of broadcasting the Episodes, the Seven Licensees contravened s 52 of the Act by making, or adopting as their own, misleading and deceptive representations concerning Ms Boholt, Ms Forster and the Mentoring Program.
The Commission, Ms Boholt, Ms Forster and Universal have agreed on a form of order to dispose of the proceedings as between those parties.
The parties agreed to defer the making of those orders until the determination of the proceedings against the other respondents.
4 The Seven Licensees deny making any misleading or deceptive representations.
They say that the Episodes merely report the claims of Ms Boholt and Ms Forster.
The intention, it is said, was to broadcast a series of reports whereby those claims would be tested.
That testing did not eventuate by reason of the Commission's intervention.
The Seven Licensees further submit that, even if misleading and deceptive representations were made, s 65A of the Act provides them with a complete defence.
The Commission asserts that the effect of the contract, arrangement or understanding between Seven Network on behalf of the Seven Licensees (or between the second respondent on behalf of itself and the Seven Licensees) and the women is to except the Seven Licensees from the exemption from liability for a contravention of s 52 of the Act provided by s 65A of the Act.
5 No contravention of the Act is alleged against Seven Network.
Seven Network is the holding company of the Seven Licensees.
An injunction is sought against Seven Network on the basis that it is alleged to have entered the contract, arrangement or understanding with Ms Boholt and Ms Forster to broadcast the Episodes on behalf of the Seven Licensees.
Seven submits that, as neither contravention of the Act nor accessorial liability is alleged against Seven Network, Seven Network cannot be the subject of any claim for relief and proceedings against it should be summarily dismissed.
