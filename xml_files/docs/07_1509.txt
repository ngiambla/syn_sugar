The applicants say that certain home designs have been copied by the first respondent to produce designs from which project homes have been built and sold to the public.
Each of the other respondents, they say, authorised this infringement of copyright.
THE PARTIES AND THE COPYRIGHT WORKS 
 
2 Barrett Property Group Pty Ltd designs, builds and sells residential project homes in Victoria.
It trades under the name "Porter Davis Homes".
The business was commenced by Daniel Studdert in or about June 1999.
Studdert had been the sales manager of Metricon Homes Pty Ltd between September 1997 and June 1999.
Barrett is the owner of copyright in homes known as the Seattle 31 and the Memphis 33.
The Memphis 33 is an adaptation of the Seattle 31.
A home was built to the Seattle 31 plan at Scenic Drive, Beaconsfield and opened in early 2000.
In November 2001 a home was completed to the Memphis 33 plan at 5 Highgate Way, Rowville.
3 SRS Property Group Pty Ltd is the owner of copyright in the plans of the Seattle 31 (Schedule A) and the Memphis 33 (Schedule B).
I will refer to these homes and plans, together as the Copyright Works.
Whilst ownership of copyright is divided in this way, I will, unless the context otherwise demands, treat the applicants collectively.
4 Metricon also designs, builds and sells residential project homes in Victoria.
5 Mr Palazzesi is the managing director of Metricon.
In June 1999 he joined Metricon as general manager, and on 1 July 2001 was appointed its managing director.
He had experience spanning some 35 years in project home businesses, at financial, operational and management levels.
Upon joining Metricon, Palazzesi developed a plan to convert the company from a low volume to a high volume builder but maintaining its reputation for high quality.
The plan involved the construction and sale of approximately 800 homes a year.
It also involved the development of an attractive product range.
6 Mr Popple is Metricon's Product Development Manager.
He had commenced work with Metricon in 1987 as a trainee draftsman and progressed from there over the years to various positions.
He became drawing office manager then assumed responsibility for briefing external interior designers.
He began, around 1995, to undertake some design work.
In 1996 he began to design a home which assumes some importance in this case.
It was called the Eldridge and Popple said that it was based on his own ideas and some concepts that he had seen in homes in the United States when he had visited there the year before.
THE ALLEGED INFRINGING WORKS 
 
7 The applicants say that Metricon drew plans and from these constructed the following display homes in Victoria in breach of their respective copyright in the Copyright Works.
These display homes were opened at or about the times stated below: 
 
 
 
 Schedule C: the Prada 35 --- February 2003 at the Deer Park display village and Fogarty Avenue Highton; 
 
 

Schedule D: the Tyrell 29 - May 2002 at Craigieburn; 
 
Schedule E: the Connolly 30 --- August 2003 at Point Cook;
 
Schedule F: the Coburn 33 --- October 2004 at Point Cook; and
 
Schedule G: the Streeton 34 --- November 2003 at Keysborough.
In fact the plan at Schedule F said by the applicants to be the Coburn 33 is in fact the Coburn 39.
However, this makes no difference in this case in light of the evidence of Dr John Cooke to which I will refer later.
I will refer to the above plans and homes as "the Alleged Infringing Works".
THE PRIMARY ISSUE: COPYING OF SUBSTANTIAL PART 
 
8 During the course of the hearing, the respondents conceded the issue of subsistence in the Copyright Works.
They accepted that the Seattle 31 and Memphis 33 plans and homes had sufficient originality to support the bare subsistence of copyright.
9 The applicants abandoned, during closing submissions, the case in tortious liability.
10 The applicants say that, in contravention of the Copyright Act (1968) (Cth) ("the Act") the Alleged Infringing Works were reproduced by actual copying from the Copyright Works or a substantial part of each of the Copyright Works.
The respondents admit that the Alleged Infringing Works were brought into existence, but deny that, in doing so, they have infringed the applicants' copyright.
The applicants did not seriously press their claim that the whole of the Copyright Works, in each case, was reproduced.
Rather, the case concerned whether, in respect of each plan and home, a substantial part had been reproduced by copying: s 14(1) and s 31(1)(b)(i) of the Act.
11 The "substantial part" of the Copyright Works identified by the applicants was the so-called "alfresco quadrant".
This part comprised the combination of the rumpus, family, kitchen and meals areas around the alfresco, all under a single roof-line, but also having regard to the location and relative dimensions of rooms in this part of the house design.
12 Accordingly, the primary issue is whether Metricon infringed copyright as alleged.
If infringement is established, then there is a consequential question as to whether each of Palazzesi and Popple are personally liable as having authorised the infringement.
THE LAW 
 Copyright in Project Homes 
 
13 The application of copyright law to project homes and designs is not without difficulty.
The competing concepts in copyright law of 'ideas' and 'expression of ideas' underpin the difficulty: Kenrick  Co v Lawrence  Co (1890) 25 QBD 99 provides an apt illustration.
In that case, the author had printed a card that assisted illiterate voters.
The card's design was simple.
The design depicted a hand holding a pencil in the act of completing a cross within a square.
Willis J held that the copyright protection sought would protect the idea rather than the expression alone, since "a square can only be drawn as a square, a cross can only be drawn as a cross, and for such purposes as the plaintiff's drawing was intended to fulfil, there are scarcely more ways than one of drawing a pencil or the hand that holds it": Kenrick at 104.
The case is an extreme example, but gives expression to the idea-form dichotomy.
14 In Tamawood Ltd v Henley Arch Pty Ltd (2004) 61 IPR 378 at 387, another project home case, the majority at [39] observed that: "The idea-form distinction, often elusive, is particularly so in the case of project homes".
This, their Honours said at [38] was because such homes commonly have to be designed to fit blocks of approximately similar shape and dimension and to provide for vehicular access and accommodation.
There was, it was said, a certain commonality of features demanded by the market in question:
 
 ... such as, a certain number of bedrooms, a laundry, a kitchen, a family or rumpus room, an ensuite and a walk-in wardrobe ("WIR") in association with the main bedroom, built-in wardrobes in the other bedrooms, at least one bathroom in proximity to the other bedrooms, and certain facilities in the kitchen such as a sink, bench, dishwasher, stove, hot plate and microwave oven.


15 Project homes, and the drawing of such plans, are distinct from paintings and musical works.
The distinction lies in the fact that a project home involves a mixture of familiar ideas and common place features "based on the real world" (in the form of previous project homes and plans) and "labour, skill and judgment (in combining the various features)": Tamawood at [41]---[43].
The issue is further complicated when one bears in mind that the plan for a project home is "partly functional.
" For example, placing a kitchen in reasonable "proximity to a dining room" is, broadly, a functional consideration: see Tamawood at [41].
Accordingly, the "dividing line between that which is dictated by broad functional requirements and that which is not, is...often unclear": Tamawood at [56].
16 Importantly, one must bear in mind in this case, and as was explained in Tamawood , that an individual part of a plan or home considered in isolation may merely explain a common idea "...yet there will be copyright in the whole plan if the combination and arrangement originated with the author.
" (Emphasis added): Tamawood at [41].
17 The applicants in this case point to the particular combination in the alfresco quadrant as central to their claims.
Infringement 
 
18 The test for infringement is found in the well known passage from the judgment of Gibbs CJ in S W Hart  Co Pty Ltd v Edwards Hot Water Systems [1985] HCA 59 ; (1985) 159 CLR 466 at 472 (with whom Mason and Brennan JJ agreed).
In that case, the Chief Justice said:
 
 The notion of reproduction, for the purposes of copyright law, involves two elements -- resemblance to, and actual use of, the copyright work, or, to adopt the words which appear in the judgment of Willmer LJ in Francis Day  Hunter Ltd v Bron [1963] Ch 587 at 614, "a sufficient degree of objective similarity between the two works" and "some causal connection between the plaintiffs' and the defendants' work".
(Emphasis added)

19 Although, as I have said, the applicants' primary submission was that the whole of the Copyright Works were reproduced, their alternative case was that, in each case, a substantial part was reproduced.
For reasons which I will set out later I do not find that the whole was taken.
The alternative case, referrable to s 14(1) and s 31(1)(b)(i) of the Act, requires consideration.
20 As rightly pointed out in Eagle Homes the word "reproduction" is not defined in the Act.
Its ordinary meaning, however, is to "make a copy, representation, duplicate, or close imitation of" (Macquarie Dictionary) or "repeat in a more or less exact copy; produce a copy or representation of" (New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary).
The question that follows from this is: how much of the copyright work must be reproduced before it can be said that the 'work' has been reproduced and how similar must it be to the copyright work?
See Eagle Homes at [70].
There Lindgren J considered how s 14(1) and s 31(1)(b)(i) of the Act interrelate as applied to the "Paterson" and "Kookaburra" project homes that were the subject of the litigation.
At [70] to [71], his Honour stated:
 
 The effect of s 14(1) of the Act is that the reference in s 31(1)(b)(i) to reproducing an artistic work in a material form includes a reference to reproducing a substantial part of such a work in a material form.
In terms, this provision acknowledges a distinction between the undifferentiated whole of a copyright work and a substantial part of it.
The 'Paterson' does not reproduce exactly the whole of the 'Kookaburra'.
Copinger and Skone James on Copyright (13th ed, 1991), par 8---20 states as follows:
 
 ... Alternatively, the defendant's work may have been taken from part only of the plaintiff's work.
Here, the defendant's work may be an exact reproduction of that part of the plaintiff's work or it may only to a greater or lesser degree resemble that part.
In this alternative class of case, the first step is to identify the part of the plaintiff's work which is alleged to have been reproduced and then decide whether it constitutes a substantial part of the plaintiff's work.
If it does, but it is not an exact copy of that part, it must then be decided whether it is a reproduction or colourable imitation of that part of the plaintiff's work.
[ Spectravest Inc v Aperknit Ltd [1988] FSR 161].

 
 
 Substantial Part 
 
21 The substantial part inquiry "imputes questions of fact and degree": Tamawood at [51].
What is important is the quality of the part taken, rather than its quantity: SW Hart at 474-5; see also Tamawood at [50] and Milpurrurru  Ors v Indofurn Pty Ltd (1994) 30 IPR 209 at 230 where the Court, in considering the qualitative worth of a part of Aboriginal artwork reproduced on carpets, stated: 
 
 Although as a proportion either of the total artwork, or the total carpet, the area of copied material in comparison with the whole is not great, in a qualitative sense the copying is substantial.
The pattern taken from the artwork constitutes the striking feature of the carpet.
And again a predominant consideration is the animus furandi of those responsible for the design.... 
 

22 Emphasis on quality rather than quantity is further exemplified in more recent Australian authorities.
In Data Access Corp v Powerflex Services Pty Ltd [1999] HCA 49 ; (1999) 202 CLR 1 at [32] , a majority of the High Court endorsed the views expressed by Mason CJ in dissent in Autodesk Inc v Dyason (No 2) [1993] HCA 6 ; (1993) 176 CLR 300 at 305.
In that case, Mason CJ, citing Ladbroke (Football) Ltd v William Hill (Football) Ltd [1964] 1 WLR 273 stated:
 
 Whether a part is substantial must be decided by its quality rather than its quantity.
The reproduction of a part which by itself has no originality will not normally be a substantial part of the copyright and therefore will not be protected.
For that which would not attract copyright except by reason of its collocation will, when robbed of that collocation, not be a substantial part of the copyright and therefore the courts will not hold its reproduction to be an infringement.
It is this, I think, which is meant by one or two judicial observations that 'there is no copyright' in some unoriginal part of a whole that is copyright.
As this statement makes clear, in determining whether the quality of what is taken makes it a 'substantial part' of the copyright work, it is important to inquire into the importance which the taken portion bears in relation to the work as a whole: is it an 'essential' or 'material' part of the work?

 
 ...in the context of copyright law, where emphasis is to be placed upon the 'originality' of the work's expression, the essential or material features of a work should be ascertained by considering the originality of the part allegedly taken.
(Emphasis added)
 

23 While the High Court's holding in Powerflex applied to a computer program, the passage is of general application.
In any event, a common thread in a case which involves computer programs and one which involves project homes, is that the copyright may overlap with functional considerations.
24 In Tamawood , the Full Court considered the meaning of the expression, 'substantial part', in the context of plans for project homes.
Wilcox and Lindgren JJ concluded at [55] that:
 
 ... it is not infringement of the part, but infringement of the whole that is in question.
Whether there has been an infringement of the whole requires that the originality of the part be considered in relation to the work in suit as a whole.
It must be determined whether the part is an 'essential or material' feature of the whole work , regarded as a copyright work, in the present case, as an artistic work.
In our opinion, it must be asked whether the part or parts taken represent a substantial part of the labour, skill and judgment of the author that made the whole work 'original' .
(Emphasis added) 
 
 

25 Reference to the essential or material features mirrors the language in Powerflex.
The passages in both Powerflex and Tamawood are firmly grounded in Ladbroke .
In that case, Lord Pearce stated in dictum:
 
 Whether a part is substantial must be decided by its quality rather than its quantity.
The reproduction of a part which by itself has no originality will not normally be a substantial part of the copyright and therefore will not be protected .
For that which would not attract copyright except by reason of its collocation will, when robbed of that collocation, not be a substantial part of the copyright and therefore the courts will not hold its reproduction to be an infringement.
It is this, I think, which is meant by one or two judicial observations that " there is no copyright " in some unoriginal part of a whole that is copyright.
(Emphasis added) 
 

26 In other words, if an unoriginal part of the whole is taken that does not represent a substantial part of the labour, skill and judgment of the author that made the whole work 'original', then there is no infringement: Powerflex at [32].
