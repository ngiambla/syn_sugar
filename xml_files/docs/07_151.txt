1 This case is principally a copyright infringement action.
The applicant, TS  B Retail Systems Pty Ltd (TSB Retail), alleges that the corporate respondent, 3Fold Resources Pty Ltd (3Fold), copied 234 manufacturing drawings and 5 tables of data in which TSB Retail holds copyright.
TSB Retail says 3Fold used the drawings and data to manufacture, supply and install shop fittings (including interior fittings, displays, stock presentations and shelves) for retailers who would otherwise have purchased those products and services from TSB Retail.
The main case, however, is against the individual respondents.
They are the directors of 3Fold and the only ones likely to have assets to satisfy any award of damages TSB Retail is able to recover.
The case against them is that they procured 3Fold to breach the copyright.
2 In addition to the copyright infringement claim, there are claims for breach of confidence and subsidiary claims in misleading or deceptive conduct, misleading or false representations and unconscionable conduct in contravention respectively of ss 52 , 53 and 51AA of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth).
The Trade Practices Act claims were not seriously pressed at trial.
TSB Retail accepts in the event it succeeds in its copyright action, the other claims will become redundant.
3 It became common ground during the course of the proceeding that the 234 drawings and the 5 tables were copied.
The action is defended on the basis that TSB Retail does not own copyright in the drawings and that the tables are not protected by copyright.
There is an additional defence to the copyright claim in relation to the drawings, namely that 3Fold sold products manufactured from the drawings to Kmart, which 3Fold says was licensed by the copyright owner to reproduce the drawings.
In relation to the breach of confidence claim, the respondents deny that the drawings and tables were confidential and assert, if they were confidential, that any right to sue for breach of that confidence does not lie with TSB Retail.
Background 
 
4 The facts, for the most part, are clear.
In 1930, Silverwood  Beck Pty Ltd (SB) was established to design, manufacture and construct interior fittings, displays and stock presentation shelving for Coles variety stores throughout Australia.
In 1985 the plant and equipment, stock, goodwill, and "business records, documents and other information" of SB were purchased by Trollope (Australia) Pty Ltd for $6.9 million.
The combined business (by change of name or amalgamation) was called Trollope Silverwood and Beck Pty Ltd (TSB).
TSB continued to design and manufacture shop fittings and related products.
Its customers were major retail outlets such as Coles Myer Ltd (including Coles supermarkets and Kmart) (CML), Big W, Optus, Dick Smith Electronics, Shell and Woolworths.
TSB was owned and run by Barry Trollope (who had established Trollope Australia in 1969) and his son, Grant Trollope.
5 Within a few years TSB grew to be a sizable operation.
At the height of its business TSB had around 500 employees.
In the year ended 30 June 1999, it earned net profits of approximately $2.4m before tax.
But its success did not last.
Just two years later, TSB's profitability had declined so significantly that the company was finding it difficult to pay its suppliers and continue operating.
In the year ended 30 June 2001 it suffered a net loss of around $110,000.
In the following year the net loss exceeded $4m.
This was too much for the company's creditors.
On 28 October 2002 a debenture holder, the National Australia Bank Limited, appointed John Lindholm and James Stewart, both of Ferrier Hodgson, Chartered Accountants, to be the receivers and managers of the company's assets and undertaking.
On the same day the directors appointed Ian Carson and David Crosbie of Carson  McLellan PPB to be the administrators of the company.
6 Despite the receivers moving in, there was talk that TSB might be able to trade out of its financial difficulties.
It soon became apparent, however, at least to some of the employees, that the company would be wound up and their jobs would be lost.
Among those concerned for their future were the individual respondents, Peter Vanderzaag, Francis D'Mello and Gary Smith.
7 Vanderzaag was the Operations Manager for TSB's Business Unit.
He had been in the shop-fitting industry for more than 25 years and had been employed by TSB in various capacities including factory manager, warehouse manager and finally Operations Manager for the retail division.
In that capacity, in which he had served for around 15 years, Vanderzaag was responsible for the delivery of services and projects to TSB's major customers, including Kmart.
8 D'Mello, who was the Information Technology Manager for TSB, had been with the company for over 15 years.
He joined TSB in 1986 to convert the company's then manual systems to computer based systems.
Over the years D'Mello had assumed other responsibilities including the management of various computer systems upgrades and TSB's "year 2000" compliance program.
9 Smith, who was the Constructions Manager (Retail Projects) for TSB, had been with the company for about 5 years following a career in the army.
He was initially responsible for reviewing the internal processes of TSB and making recommendations to design and improve efficiencies.
As Construction Manager, Smith focused on redesigning the installation procedures for TSB's retail division.
This included the procedures for the preparation of quotations, labour allocation, contract management, site control procedures and safety issues.
10 In view of their age (each was in his 40s or 50s), obtaining new employment was not going to be easy for the three men, despite their experience.
Something had to be done to find work.
So they decided to set up their own business to operate in the one area they knew well, namely the provision and installation of shop-fittings to retail organisations.
11 It may be that when the idea of setting up their own business was first mooted, the individual respondents thought they would face little by way of competition for old TSB's clients once the TSB business closed down.
They may also have believed, at least for a time, that with TSB's closure they were entitled to make use of TSB's designs, drawings and data or, if not entitled, at least that they could use the drawings and data with impunity.
If this is what they had in mind, they were seriously mistaken as they were soon to discover.
12 The individual respondents took little time to put their plan into action.
By the beginning of November 2002 they had prepared a submission describing the services their new business would perform and provided that submission to Kmart, TSB's largest client.
They then met Peter Healy, the National Store Development Manager at Kmart, to discuss the submission.
13 It was around this time that 3Fold was incorporated.
The shares in the company were held in equal number by Vanderzaag, D'Mello and Smith, each of whom was appointed a director of the company.
The work each would perform for the company had been agreed: Vanderzaag was to be responsible for operations and business development; D'Mello for finance, administration and systems; and Smith for logistics and resources (including managing all installation works and project management).
The idea was that 3Fold would offer shop fitting services, including project management, stock maintenance and installation and equipment supply to retail outlets.
It was not intended that 3Fold manufacture shop fittings itself; rather that it would procure fittings from other manufacturers for supply to its customers.
In effect, 3Fold's manufacturing operation was to be outsourced.
The individual respondents hoped 3Fold would obtain business from at least Kmart and Big W.
 
14 3Fold did not begin operations immediately upon its incorporation as it had yet to obtain office and warehouse premises.
It did, however, begin to seek out business.
While this was taking place the individual respondents continued to work at TSB, the business of which was beginning to be wound down by the receivers.
As a consequence, most of TSB's staff were, or were in the process of, being laid off.
Among them was Smith who was told his employment would terminate on 11 December 2002.
Only key staff that were required to finalise projects, wind down the business and maintain core operations that might attract a buyer, were retained.
Vanderzaag and D'Mello were among the employees kept on.
15 As well as winding down the business the receivers were taking steps to sell TSB's assets.
Those assets had to be preserved in the meantime.
To this end, the receivers put TSB's employees on notice that when they left they should not take with them any of TSB's property.
For example, on 13 November 2002, Lindholm wrote to all employees reminding them of their obligations.
