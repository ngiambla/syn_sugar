 INTRODUCTION 
 
1 The applicant, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission ("the ACCC"), alleges that the respondents have contravened or have been involved in contravention of the Trade Practices Act 1975 (Cth) ("the Act ").
It is alleged that the respondents breached an applicable industry code.
The respondents are: Kyloe Pty Ltd ("Kyloe"), its sole director Kevin McCann ("McCann"), Impact Design Accessories Pty Ltd ("Impact") and its two directors, Robert Morpeth and Therese Morpeth ("Morpeths").
The Morpeths have not entered an appearance in this proceeding.
2 The respondents are or were involved in the business of distributing Polar Krush ice-drink machines and the resale of various Polar Krush Products --- including: cups, straws and frozen drink concentrate, being branded goods originating from the Northumbrian Ice Cream Company Ltd ("NICC") in the United Kingdom.
Kyloe and Impact entered into agreement with twenty two Sub-Distributors who are not parties to the proceeding, but include: M and T Barker Pty Ltd ("Barker"); Kool Innovations Pty Ltd ("Kool Innovations"); Ryan's Ice Drinks Pty Ltd ("Ryan"); Healthy Break Pty Ltd ("Healthy Break"); and Sandra Ogrizovic ("Ogrizovic") (herein collectively described as the "Sub-Distributors" where context permits).
3 The ACCC claims that Kyloe and Impact have contravened the Franchising Code of Conduct ("the Code") prescribed by the Trade Practices (Industry Codes-Franchising) Regulations 1998 (Cth) by failing to provide disclosure documents, required by the Code, to its Sub-Distributors.
The Code imposes mandatory obligations: see s 51AD of the Act .
4 The ACCC further claims that the directors of Kyloe and Impact have incurred ancillary liability for the contraventions of Kyloe and Impact: see ss 75 and 80(1) of the Act .
5 The respondents deny contravention of the Code and any related ancillary liability.
Moreover, the respondents claim that their business arrangements with Sub-Distributors do not constitute franchise agreements and thus do not fall within the purview of the Code.
The respondents claim that a more accurate description of their business relationship with the Sub-Distributors is one of distribution or dealership.
Accordingly, the respondents claim that they did not contravene the provisions of the Code or breach s 51AD of the Act .
