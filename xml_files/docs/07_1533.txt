 
1 On 12 September 2007 I delivered judgment in this matter: Quinlan v A  J Brady Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1409.
I ordered that the application be dismissed, and directed that the parties file written submissions in relation to costs.
Those submissions were subsequently filed.
2 The respondents argued that they should be entitled to costs, not on the usual party and party basis, but rather on a solicitor and own client basis.
