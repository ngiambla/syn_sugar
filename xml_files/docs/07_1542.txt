 (Indemnity costs) 
 INTRODUCTION 
 
1 I published Reasons for Judgment on 15 August 2007 in this proceeding and in proceeding NSD 2335 of 2005 (Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Wellnora Pty Limited (subject to a Deed of Company Arrangement)) ( Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Wellnora Pty Limited [2007] FCA 1234).
The only orders then made were for the filing of submissions and the listing of the proceeding for oral elaboration on those submissions.
2 At [262] of the earlier Reasons, I indicated that the parties should have the opportunity of making further submissions in relation to certain issues there identified.
Subsequently, the relevant parties agreed that both the winding up proceeding and the DOCA proceeding (I am using in these Reasons the forms of abbreviation that I used in the earlier Reasons) should be dismissed and that the DCT should pay the defendants' costs in both proceedings.
The only issue left outstanding was whether the costs of the Administrators in this, the DOCA proceeding, should be paid on an indemnity basis, or on the ordinary party/party basis.
It is to this issue that the present Reasons are directed.
3 The Administrators have made helpful written submissions in support of their application for indemnity costs.
There is no dispute in relation to the governing principles.
The categories of case in which the discretion to award costs on the indemnity basis may be properly exercised are not closed, and an order is not compelled by the mere fact that the circumstances fit within a literal description that has been given of the features of an earlier case in which indemnity costs were ordered: NMFM Property Pty Ltd v Citibank Ltd (No 2) [2001] FCA 480 ; (2000) 109 FCR 77 at 92 [53] .
4 Ordinarily, costs are ordered on a party/party basis, and it is only if a case is "special" or out of the ordinary that indemnity costs may properly be ordered.
In Hamod v New South Wales (2002) 188 ALR 659, Gray J (with whom the other members of the Full Court agreed) stated (at [20]) that indemnity costs served the purpose of compensating a party fully for costs incurred where the Court is of the view that it was "unreasonable for the party against whom the order is made to have subjected the innocent party to the exposure of costs".
