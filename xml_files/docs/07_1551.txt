 
1 On 3 October 2007 I made declarations and orders against Tonadale Pty Ltd, the second defendant.
That company was represented and consented to the relief granted.
Kelvin Mark Skeers, the first defendant, has not appeared on the hearing.
The claims against the first defendant are undefended.
They arise out of the same facts as were relevant to the case against the second defendant.
Indeed, the second defendant accepted liability for the actions of the first defendant.
Nonetheless, because declarations are sought that are novel, I reserved in order to consider whether there is a proper basis for those declarations.
However, I have not approached that question as if this were a contested hearing.
On that basis, I am satisfied that declarations and the order for costs are appropriate.
2 Counsel for the plaintiff, Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) made detailed submissions in writing as to the facts proved on the evidence and as to the applicable law and supplemented those submissions orally at the hearing and by two subsequent memoranda.
I am satisfied that the factual content of the declarations sought is well founded.
I should say something, albeit briefly, about the law.
3 Two general points can be made.
First, each of s 12CB(1) and s 12DA(1) of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001 (Cth) (the Act) prohibits certain conduct by "a person" which, in the absence of any special definition, includes a natural person.
As all of the conduct in this case occurred in the Australian Capital Territory, the sections apply according to their terms (s 4(1) together with the definitions of "Territory" and "this jurisdiction" in s 5 of the Act).
Second, there is no difficulty in each of the first and second defendants being responsible for the conduct of the first defendant ( Houghton v Arms [2006] HCA 59 ; (2006) 225 CLR 553).
Declarations 1 and 2 --- section 12CB 
 
4 Section 12CB(1) provides as follows:
 
 "A person must not, in trade or commerce, in connection with the supply or possible supply of financial services to a person, engage in conduct that is, in all the circumstances, unconscionable.
" 
 

5 There is no doubt that what occurred was "in trade or commerce".
"Financial service" is defined in s 12BAB of the Act.
That, in turn, incorporates the definition of "financial product" in s 12BAA.
A "credit facility" (within the meaning of the regulations) is such a product (s 12BAA(7)(k)).
Regulation 2B of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Regulations 2001 (Cth) defines "credit facility" in a manner that is apt to pick up what took place between the second defendant, Mr Biega and Pepper Homeloans.
6 The conduct was, in all the circumstances, "unconscionable".
That term, in this section, is not limited as it is in s 12CA by a connection with the unwritten law (cf s 51AA of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth); Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v CG Berbatis Holdings Pty Ltd [2003] HCA 18 ; (2003) 214 CLR 51; GPG (Australia Trading) Pty Ltd v GIO Australia Holdings Pty Ltd [2001] FCA 1761 ; (2001) 117 FCR 23 at [113] ---[126]).
Section 12CB is the equivalent of s 51AB of the Trade Practices Act (as to which, see, Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) v Radio Rentals Ltd [2005] FCA 1133 ; (2005) 146 FCR 292 at [23] ---[24]).
The width of the concept is underlined by the factors referred to in s 12CB(2).
7 It may be accepted for present purposes that, as the loan in question was required to complete the purchase of a private residence, the financial services were of a kind ordinarily acquired for personal, domestic or household use within the meaning of s 12CB(5).
Declarations 3, 4, 5 and 6 --- section 12DA(1) 
 
8 Section 12DA(1) provides as follows:
 
 "A person must not, in trade or commerce, engage in conduct in relation to financial services that is misleading or deceptive or is likely to mislead or deceive.
" 
 

9 It follows from what has been said that the conduct was in trade or commerce and was in relation to financial services.
In my opinion, it was misleading and deceptive and was likely to mislead or deceive each of Pepper Homeloans and Mr Biega in the respects alleged.
Conclusion 
 
10 Declarations 1 to 6 (inclusive) and an order for costs will be made.
I certify that the preceding ten (10) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Gyles.
