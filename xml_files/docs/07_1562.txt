 
1 I have before me a notice of motion filed 23 August 2007 by the first and second respondents in the substantive proceedings, seeking an order for security for costs and consequential orders.
2 For convenience, in this judgment I shall continue to refer to the applicant in the substantive proceedings as "the applicant" notwithstanding that it is the respondent to the present notice of motion, and the respondents in the substantive proceedings as "the respondents".
Background 
 
3 The substantive proceedings were commenced by application filed 18 December 2006 in the Western Australian Registry of the Court.
By order of Siopis J of 6 February 2007 the proceedings were transferred to the Brisbane Registry of the Court.
4 The applicant's claim arises out of one or more agreements between the applicant, in its capacity as trustee of the SDA Tarameo Unit Trust, and the respondents, for the purchase of four lots at the Hope Island residential development in Queensland, and alleged misrepresentations by the respondents as to the market value of those properties.
The applicant alleges, inter alia , breach of s 52 Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) ("TP Act") by the first and second respondents, and seeks damages in the sum of $842,865.20 and an order that the relevant agreements be set aside.
5 I note that the first respondent also seeks declaratory relief against the applicant by way of cross-claim.
6 The first and second respondents filed a defence and cross-claim in these proceedings on 2 March 2007.
No further progress was made on this file until 23 August 2007 when the first and second respondents filed this notice of motion seeking security for costs.
7 The notice of motion seeking security for costs came before me on 13 September 2007, however the matter was adjourned by consent in order to allow the respondents the opportunity to consider an undertaking offered by the applicant in settlement of the respondents' claim for security for costs, and supporting affidavit material served on the respondents that morning.
When the matter returned before me on 8 October 2007 the parties informed me that the proposal of the applicant in settlement of the notice of motion for security for costs which was in the form of a Deed of Guarantee, had not been accepted by the respondents.
Relevant legislation 
 
8 Section 1335 Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) provides as follows:
 
 (1) Where a corporation is plaintiff in any action or other legal proceeding, the court having jurisdiction in the matter may, if it appears by credible testimony that there is reason to believe that the corporation will be unable to pay the costs of the defendant if successful in his, her or its defence, require sufficient security to be given for those costs and stay all proceedings until the security is given.
(1A) Subsection (1) does not apply to a corporation that is an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander corporation.
Note: Similar provision is made in relation to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander corporations under section 581-20 of the Corporations (Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander) Act 2006 .
(2) The costs of any proceeding before a court under this Act are to be borne by such party to the proceeding as the court, in its discretion, directs.


9 Section 56 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) provides:
 
 (1) The Court or a Judge may order an applicant in a proceeding in the Court or an appellant in an appeal to the Court to give security for the payment of costs that may be awarded against him or her.
(2) The security shall be of such amount, and given at such time and in such manner and form, as the Court or Judge directs.
(3) The Court or a Judge may reduce or increase the amount of security ordered to be given and may vary the time at which, or manner or form in which, the security is to be given.
(4) If security, or further security, is not given in accordance with an order under this section, the Court or a Judge may order that the proceeding or appeal be dismissed.
(5) This section does not affect the operation of any provision made by or under any other Act or by the Rules of Court for or in relation to the furnishing of security.


10 The respondents have sought an order for security for costs pursuant to s 1335 Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) and, in addition and in the alternative, s 56 of the Federal Court Act 1976 (Cth).
The parties have not addressed the issue whether the content of the requirement to act judicially is different under s 56 to that under s 1335.
In my view, it is not necessary for me to consider this issue separately.
The only issue in contention is whether the Court should grant an order for security for costs in this case under either provision.
Affidavit material filed by the respondents in support of the notice of motion 
 
11 The first and second respondents rely on three affidavits in support of the notice of motion for security for costs.
12 First, an affidavit sworn 22 August 2007 by Mr Michael Graham, solicitor, in which he deposes that he has been retained by McCullough Robertson, solicitors for the first and second respondents, to prepare an estimate as to future costs to be incurred, on a party and party basis, for the period up to and including the hearing of the substantive proceedings.
Mr Graham is the principal of a legal costs firm "grahamcosts legal + forensic costs consultants".
