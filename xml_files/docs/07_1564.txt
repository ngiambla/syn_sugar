1 In December 1979, Ms Linda Coe was injured in an explosion at a factory at St Marys owned by the Department of Defence where she then worked.
She suffered physical injuries in the accident and was unable to work for some time.
2 Although she received compensation from Comcare, or its predecessor, and damages for a common law claim, she apparently had no communication with Comcare between May 1984 and September 2001.
In September 2001, Ms Coe sought to resurrect her claim for compensation contending that she suffered Post Traumatic Stress Disorder as a result of the explosion at the factory.
3 On 5 March 2007, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal affirmed two reviewable decisions, the effect of which was to reject Ms Coe's claim.
The Tribunal found that she did suffer from a psychiatric condition, which it did not expressly identify but which it found was not Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.
However, the Tribunal found that the condition was not "relevantly caused" by the accident: see [5].
4 In coming to that conclusion, the Tribunal preferred the evidence of a psychiatrist called by Comcare, Dr Skinner, to that of two other psychiatrists, Drs Dinnen and Synnott.
The Tribunal gave reasons for doing so.
5 Nevertheless, Ms Coe contends that the Tribunal's decision was affected by errors of law within the meaning of the s 5 of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 (Cth) ("the ADJR Act ").
She seeks review of the decision on three principal grounds.
6 The first ground is failure to set out the Tribunal's findings on material questions of fact and the evidence on which the findings were based.
This ground is said to arise because the Tribunal did not arrive at a diagnosis for the psychiatric condition from which Ms Coe suffers.
7 The second ground is that the Tribunal failed to address the correct question.
This ground is said to arise because the Tribunal asked itself whether the condition was "relevantly caused" by the explosion, rather than whether it was a "contributing factor" as stated in the applicable statutory scheme.
8 The third ground is that the Tribunal failed to complete the exercise of its jurisdiction.
This is related to the second ground and is said to arise because, having found that Ms Coe suffers from a psychiatric illness, the Tribunal should have asked itself whether the condition was contributed to by her employment: see Comcare v Mooi (1996) 69 FCR 439 
 
9 Ms Coe brought a separate proceeding, NSD 577 of 2007, by way of an appeal to the Court under s 44 of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth) (' AAT Act ').
That step was taken because the Registry had, several days earlier, rejected the filing of an application for judicial review.
Counsel for Ms Coe accepts that the appeal does not raise a question of law, so that proceeding NSD 577 of 2007 must be dismissed.
The Legislation 
 
10 The Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988 (Cth) ("the SRC Act ") makes provision for payment of compensation by Comcare to Commonwealth employees in respect of an injury that results, inter alia , in the employee's incapacity for work: see s 14 of the SRC Act .
11 Injury means, amongst other things, a disease suffered by an employee: see definition in s 4 of the SRC Act as it was prior to amendment earlier this year; cf.
s 5A(1) of the current SRC Act .
12 The term "disease" was defined in s 4 of the SRC Act , prior to its 2007 amendment, as follows:
 
 
 
 "(a) any ailment suffered by an employee; or 
 (b) the aggravation of any such ailment; 
 being an ailment or an aggravation that was contributed to in a material degree by the employee's employment..." 
 
 
 
 

13 Any entitlement of Ms Coe to compensation from Comcare arose prior to the commencement of the SRC Act .
The transitional provisions of the SRC Act deal with this by providing that a person is entitled to compensation under that Act in respect of an injury suffered before the commencement day if compensation was, or would have been payable to the person for that injury under the Compensation (Commonwealth Government Employees) Act 1971 (Cth) ("the Compensation Act") : see s 124(1A) of the SRC Act .
14 The relevant provision of the Compensation Act for present purposes is s 29 which provides for compensation to be payable where the employment of the employee by the Commonwealth was "a contributing factor" to the contraction of the disease or to its aggravation, acceleration or recurrence: see s 29(1)(b) of the Compensation Act .
The Facts 
 
15 It is not necessary for me to set out the background facts in any detail as they are sufficiently recorded in the reasons for decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.
16 Ms Coe's injury occurred on 10 December 1979 when she was 20 years old.
She appears to have suffered fairly extensive physical injuries because she was in Nepean Hospital for nine days.
Her injuries included lacerations to the face and neck, embedded foreign bodies, disturbed hearing and concussion.
Liability for compensation payments was accepted by the Commonwealth and Ms Coe received compensation payments under the Compensation Act from about the time of the accident.
17 During 1980 Ms Coe continued to receive medical treatment and was re-admitted to hospital on one occasion.
A note on her work medical file in November 1980 stated that she was not fit to return to work.
The note referred to "nerves" and said that she would be seeing a hypnotist.
18 In 1981 Ms Coe saw a number of medical practitioners for medico-legal assessment for a claim for damages.
There were two psychiatric reports prepared in 1981 which were relevant to the proceedings in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.
One was from Dr Revai.
The other was from Dr McMurdo.
19 Dr Revai's report of 17 June 1981 stated that Ms Coe was "overinvolved with her facial appearance".
This was apparently a reference to scarring from the explosion.
He went on to say that he could not satisfy himself "that there were any other signs of anxiety" inappropriate to her personal circumstances.
20 Dr McMurdo could find "no real evidence" of severe clinical depression.
Dr McMurdo said that Ms Coe believed she was more tense and self-conscious as a result of her facial scarring and that:
 
 "(i)t seems probable that the anxiety which [Ms Coe] manifests and the symptoms of headaches are related to the accident..." 
 
 

21 Ms Coe's common law claim for damages in the District Court of New South Wales was settled on 25 February 1982.
She was awarded $19,000 inclusive of costs.
From this, there was deducted an amount of approximately $6,000 in respect of compensation payments made to her under the Compensation Act .
22 By letter dated 21 May 1984 from Commonwealth Employees' Compensation, Ms Coe was informed that she would not be entitled to any further compensation under the Compensation Act until such time as the net amount awarded for damages had been offset by the compensation that would have been payable but for the damages award.
23 On 25 September 2001, Ms Coe's solicitors wrote to Comcare giving notice of their instructions to resurrect the claim.
They stated their instructions that Ms Coe's incapacity and need for treatment continued as a result of her injury on 10 December 1979.
They also stated that they were instructed that Ms Coe's ongoing difficulties included anxiety and depression as well as other ailments.
24 On 7 April 2005 a delegate of Comcare refused the claim.
The delegate's decision was that Ms Coe did not "presently suffer from the effects of [her] compensable injury on 10 December 1979".
That decision was reconsidered and affirmed by Comcare on 10 June 2005.
The Tribunal's Decision 
 
25 In its introduction, the Tribunal said that the only issue in the proceedings was whether the psychiatric condition from which Ms Coe suffers was "relevantly caused" by the explosion.
