 Telstra's Grievance 
 
1 The applicant in this matter, Telstra Corporation Limited ('Telstra') is an aggrieved applicant for funding by the Commonwealth of Australia ('the Commonwealth') of up to $600 million under a 'Broadband Connect Infrastructure Program' ('the Infrastructure Programme') jointly announced by the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts ('the Minister') and the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade on 21 September 2006.
2 Guidelines issued by the Commonwealth on 21 September 2006 in respect of the Infrastructure Programme indicated that funding would/may be provided:
 
 'to support the capital cost of establishing new broadband infrastructure, including upgrades to existing infrastructure, to enable the provision of wholesale broadband services to under-served premises and areas broadly across regional Australia.
' 


 
It was emphasised that funding would not be provided:
 
 'to support the ongoing operation of networks established through the program.
' 


 
3 Telstra lodged its application for funding under the Infrastructure Programme on 18 December 2006, seeking a grant of $600 million.
It would appear that in January 2007 Telstra advised the Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts ('the Department') that since lodging its application it had decided to proceed with 'OF installation to Marble Bar' at its own expense for operational reasons.
Accordingly, it sought permission from the Department to remove such installation from its application and to substitute other works.
By an email dated 25 January 2007 an officer of the Department invited Telstra to do so.
On 31 January 2007 Telstra provided the Department with an amended application and other documents explaining the relevant changes.
4 On 18 June 2007 Telstra was advised by an officer of the Department that its application had been unsuccessful.
It was also informed that on 18 June 2007 the Prime Minister had announced that:
 
 'the Government intends to enter into a funding agreement with OPEL Networks Pty Ltd.
The OPEL Networks proposal was considered to offer the Government the best value for money.
