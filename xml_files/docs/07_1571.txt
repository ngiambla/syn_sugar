 (first court hearing) 
 INTRODUCTION 
 
1 The plaintiffs (I will refer to them respectively as "PGA" and "PGA Tour") have applied for orders under ss 411 and 413 of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) (the Act).
2 PGA and PGA Tour are both golfing associations structured as not-for-profit companies limited by guarantee.
Two schemes of arrangement are proposed: one between PGA and its members (PGA Members), and the other between PGA Tour and its members (PGA Tour Members).
If implemented, the two schemes will effect a merger of PGA's and PGA Tour's respective activities, assets and liabilities to form those of a new not-for-profit company limited by guarantee, New Golf Limited (New PGA), which will have as its members the PGA Members and the PGA Tour Members.
PGA and PGA Tour will then be deregistered under s 413(1)(d) of the Act.
3 Recent cases in this Court in which transfer orders under s 413 have been made in connection with the approval of compromises or arrangements under Pt 5.1 of the Act include Royal Victorian Institute for the Blind Ltd v RBS.RVIB.VAF (2004) 206 ALR 581; SGIC Insurance Ltd v Insurance Australia Ltd (2004) 51 ACSR 470; Re Stork ICM Australia Pty Ltd (2007) 25 ACLC 208 and In the Application of United Medical Protection [2007] FCA 631 ( United Medical Protection ).
4 At the first court hearing (on 9 October 2007), the plaintiffs sought, and I made, an order under s 411(1) of the Act that PGA convene a meeting of the PGA Members for the purpose of considering and, if thought fit, agreeing (with or without modification) to the scheme of arrangement proposed to be made between PGA and the PGA Members (the PGA Scheme).
Similarly, PGA Tour sought, and I made, an order that PGA Tour convene a meeting of the PGA Tour Members for the purpose of considering, and if thought fit, agreeing (with or without modification) to the scheme of arrangement proposed to be made between PGA Tour and the PGA Tour Members (the PGA Tour Scheme).
These are the reasons why I made those orders.
5 When the originating process was filed on 18 September 2007, New PGA had not been incorporated.
It was subsequently incorporated and I gave the plaintiffs leave to file in court at the hearing an amended originating process joining New PGA as defendant.
There was affidavit evidence that New PGA was aware of the present proceeding, did not wish to appear, and was content with any order that the Court might see fit to make under s 413 of the Act.
As well, the affidavit showed that New PGA's Board of Directors had approved of the Scheme Book (see below).
In all the circumstances, I made an order dispensing with service on New PGA.
