 INTRODUCTION 
 
1 Mr Perry enlisted in the Royal Australian Navy on 4 March 1991.
He served as an Aircrew Observer.
In December 2000 he developed an undiagnosed viral illness while on duty in the Solomon Islands, which precipitated post viral fatigue syndrome.
Mr Perry lodged a claim for compensation with the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission ('the Commission') in October 2001 and liability was accepted in February 2002.
That is, Mr Perry sustained an injury that led to impairment, which impairment was accepted by the Commission.
Mr Perry was discharged from the Navy on 7 July 2002 with the rank of Lieutenant.
As of that date, Mr Perry was a person who had ceased to be employed by the Commonwealth.
2 Persons serving in the Navy in Mr Perry's position were entitled to flying allowances based on seniority which increased automatically every two years until "top tier" ('the increment').
Mr Perry was in receipt of the increment as at his date of discharge and would have been entitled to the increment had he not been medically discharged due to his compensable condition.
