 
1 I have before me a notice of motion filed yesterday by bci duells lawyers, the solicitors for the first and second respondents in the substantive proceedings (to whom I shall continue to refer as "the respondents"), seeking the following orders :
 
 
 1.
The date for trial fixed by the Court be vacated in accordance with Order 30 rule 7 of the Federal Court Rules .

 
 
 
 
 
 2.
The Court dispense with the requirements of service of this Notice as set out in Order 19 rule 3 in accordance with Order 19 rule 2 of the Federal Court Rules .

 
 
 
 
 
 3.
Costs of this application and the adjourned trial be reserved to the trial judge.

 
 4.
Any further order or other order as to this Honourable Court seems appropriate.

 
 Background 
 
2 The hearing of the substantive proceedings in this matter is listed for five days commencing Monday 22 October 2007.
Accordingly, there is some urgency attendant on a decision as to whether those hearing dates be vacated.
3 In summary, the applicants in the substantive proceedings seek to recover alleged shortfalls in respect of profit guarantees which were the subject of a covenant in a Share Sale Agreement executed on 17 December 1997.
The covenant relates to profit guarantees for the second applicant for the 1997, 1998 and 1999 calendar years.
4 In summary, two claims have been made by the applicants :
 
1. a claim for $127,284 which is alleged to be the agreed profit shortfall in respect of the 1998 calendar year.
2. a claim for $1,691,284 which is alleged to be the profit shortfall in respect of the 1999 calendar year.
In relation to this claim, the applicants have placed reliance on two reports prepared by Ernst  Young and a report produced by Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu.
5 In relation to these claims the respondents have previously sought source financial documentation of the second applicant, and any working papers that might exist in relation to the report of Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu, so as to obtain expert evidence to meet and answer the reports relied upon by the applicants.
Similarly, the affidavits of the respondents previously filed have been directed towards the substantive correctness of the second applicant's profit result for each of the 1998 and 1999 calendar years.
Ultimately however the respondents were unable to obtain any expert report to meet the reports relied upon by the applicants because:
 
1. the financial source documents relating to the second applicant's affairs in the 1998 and 1999 calendar years had not been retained by the second applicant and
 
2.
Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu had not retained its working papers in relation to the report of Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu.
6 On 12 September 2007 the respondents filed a notice of motion for a stay of the substantive proceedings pursuant to Order 20 rule 2 Federal Court Rules .
