 
1 It has been conceded by the respondent, Rod Parry, that this appeal by the Secretary, Department of Employment and Workplace Relations under s 44 of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth) against a decision of the Tribunal which determined that Mr Parry qualified for Disability Support Pension from 15 June 2005 onwards under s 94 of the Social Security Act 1991 (Cth) must be allowed.
I have in consequence made orders allowing the appeal setting aside the Tribunal's decision and remitting the matter to the Tribunal to be re-heard and determined according to law.
I indicated at the time that I would publish my reasons at a later date.
These are those reasons.
2 In essence, the appeal turns on a very narrow question.
It is whether the Tribunal, on a fair construction of its brief reasons, in fact found that Mr Parry had the "condition" described as "shortness of breath" or whether shortness of breath was merely an "impairment" which was caused by another condition, i.e.
"diabetes mellitus".
The appeal has proceeded upon the assumption that Mr Parry suffers at least from two conditions, diabetes mellitus and chronic liver failure.
3 It is the Secretary's contention that the Tribunal found as well a third condition described as "shortness of breath" and it is in respect of this alleged finding that the questions of law founding the appeal are said to arise.
While three of the four questions of law said to arise build upon this finding, it will only be necessary for me to consider whether, on a proper construction of the Tribunal's reasons, this alleged finding was in fact made.
THE REASON 
 
4 The fourth of the grounds of appeal relied upon relate to a failure by the Tribunal to address and arrive at the required satisfaction about one of the criteria statutorily prescribed in s 94(2) of the Social Security Act relating to whether a person has a continuing inability to work because of an impairment.
It is clear on the face of the Tribunal's reasons that the Tribunal only addressed one of the two criteria prescribed, that was s 94(2)(a).
It is its failure to address s 94(2)(b) that led to the concession that was made.
Because the matter must be re-determined by the Tribunal and because the Tribunal's decision has been challenged on grounds other than the failure to which I have referred above, it is appropriate that I address briefly the question whether the Tribunal did make the finding of a condition of shortness of breath contended for by the Secretary.
The essence of the Secretary's challenge is that if such a finding was made the Tribunal failed properly to apply cl 4 of the Introduction to the Tables for the Assessment of Work-Related Impairment to be found in Sched 1B of the Social Security Act .
The tables have statutory force: see s 39(1) of the Act.
5 To understand the significance of this it is necessary to refer in a little detail to the statutory setting.
6 Section 94 of the Social Security Act insofar as presently relevant provides:
 
 " Qualification for disability support pension --- continuing inability to work 
 
 94(1) A person is qualified for disability support pension if: 
 
 
 
 
 (a) the person has a physical, intellectual or psychiatric impairment; and 
 (b) the person's impairment is of 20 points or more under the Impairment Tables; and 
 
 
 
 (c) one of the following applies: 
 
 
 (i) the person has a continuing inability to work; 
 
 
 
 
 ...
 
 
 
 94(2) A person has a continuing inability to work because of an impairment if the Secretary is satisfied that: 
 
 
 
 
 
 (a) the impairment is of itself sufficient to prevent the person from doing any work independently of a program of support within the next 2 years; and 
 
 
 
 (b) either: 
 
 (i) the impairment is of itself sufficient to prevent the person from undertaking a training activity during the next 2 years; or 
 (ii) if the impairment does not prevent the person from undertaking a training activity--such activity is unlikely (because of the impairment) to enable the person to do any work independently of a program of support within the next 2 years.
" 
 
 

7 The Impairment Tables referred to in the section are, as its Introduction indicates, designed to assess whether an applicant for disability support pension meets the empirically agreed threshold in relation to the effect of a person's impairments on his or her ability to do work.
The impairments assessed are functional impairments resulting from conditions that have been fully documented and diagnosed.
8 The question posed by the assessment to be engaged in is, as indicated in clause 2 of the Introduction, "which body systems have a functional impairment due to this condition?
"
 
9 Clause 4 of the Tables indicates that a rating under any one of the specific tables relating to functional impairments is only to be assigned after a particular diagnosed condition "has been investigated, treated and stabilised".
10 Clauses 5 and 6 insofar as presently relevant go on to provide:
 
 
 "5.
The condition must be considered to be permanent.
Once a condition has been diagnosed, treated and stabilised, it is accepted as being permanent if in the light of available evidence it is more likely than not that it will persist for the foreseeable future.
This will be taken as lasting for more than two years.
A condition may be considered fully stabilised if it is unlikely that there will be any significant functional improvement, with or without reasonable treatment, within the next 2 years.
