 INTRODUCTION 
 
1 This proceeding concerned the Telstra Enterprise Agreement 2005 --- 2008 between Telstra Corporation Limited ("Telstra"), the Communications, Electrical, Electronic, Energy, Information, Postal, Plumbing and Allied Services Union of Australia ("the CEPU"), the Community and Public Section Union ("the CPSU") and others ("the 2005 Enterprise Agreement") and its relationship with the Telstra Redundancy Agreement 2002 ("the TRA").
2 The principal issue was whether Telstra breached the 2005 Enterprise Agreement by failing to pay an employee, William McDonald, a member of the CEPU ("Mr McDonald"), his previous rate of salary after he was redeployed to, and later accepted a redundancy package from, a lower paying position.
The answer to that issue turned on the proper construction of cl 17.4 of the 2005 Enterprise Agreement and, in particular whether cl 17.4 of the 2005 Enterprise Agreement permitted the application of cl 15.3 of the TRA to Mr McDonald.
3 On 2 October 2007, I concluded that Telstra had breached the 2005 Enterprise Agreement by failing to pay Mr McDonald his previous rate of salary after he was redeployed to, and later accepted a redundancy package from, a lower paying position: see [2007] FCA 1515 ("the Primary Reasons").
The facts resulting in that conclusion are set out in paras [3] to [38] of the Primary Reasons.
I do not propose to repeat them.
These reasons for decision should be read with the Primary Reasons.
I adopt the same defined terms in these reasons for decision.
4 The parties accept that as a result of the Primary Reasons, Telstra committed the following two breaches:
 
 (1) a breach of cl 17.4 of the 2005 Enterprise Agreement, by not paying Mr McDonald at the higher rate of pay after his redeployment in April 2006; and
 (2) a breach of cl 9.1 of the TRA, by not paying Mr McDonald severance pay at the higher rate of pay after Mr McDonald took voluntary redundancy in October 2006.


5 The CEPU now seeks consequential relief for those breaches in the form of an imposition of a penalty under s 178 of the Industrial Relations Act 1988 (Cth) ("the IR Act ") or s 719 of the Workplace Relations Act 1996 (Cth) ("the WR Act ") and additional declaratory relief.
The Court has jurisdiction to grant declaratory relief under s 21 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth).
ISSUES AND CONCLUSION 
 
6 The application for consequential relief raises three issues:
 
 (1) whether the IR Act or the WR Act applies;
 
 (2) whether the Court should, in the exercise of its discretion, impose a penalty and if so, the quantum of any such penalty; and
 (3) whether it is necessary and/or appropriate to grant the declaratory relief sought.


7 For the reasons that follow, although Telstra breached the 2005 Enterprise Agreement and the TRA, I consider that the Court, in the exercise of its discretion, should not impose a penalty.
Any further relief is neither necessary nor appropriate.
ANALYSIS 
 Relevant legislation --- IR Act or WR Act ?

 
8 As noted, there were two breaches by Telstra - one of the 2005 Enterprise Agreement and one of the TRA.
The 2005 Enterprise Agreement was an agreement certified pursuant to s 170LT of the WR Act : see [10] of the Primary Reasons.
Section 719(4) of the WR Act prescribes a maximum penalty of $33,000 for breach of a certified agreement.
9 The WR Act applies to the breach of cl 17.4 of the 2005 Enterprise Agreement: see s 719 of the WR Act read with cll 1 and 6 of Sched 7 to WR Act and s 717 of the WR Act .
The primary breach is that relating to cl 17.4 of the 2005 Enterprise Agreement.
10 The breach of cl 9.1 of the TRA is entirely reliant upon, and arises out of, substantially the same course of conduct as the primary breach: Gibbs v The Mayor, Councillors and Citizens of the City of Altona (1992) 37 FCR 216.
Accordingly, any penalty would be determined by reference to the "totality principle": CPSU, The Community and Public Sector Union v Telstra Corporation Limited (2001) 108 IR 228.
11 For those reasons, it is strictly unnecessary for me to conclude whether the WR Act or the IR Act applies to the breach of cl 9.1 of the TRA.
However, for the sake of completeness, I have concluded that the WR Act also applies to a breach of cl 9.1 of the TRA: see s 719 of the WR Act read with s 4(1) of the WR Act (definition of "award") and Item 4 of Sched 4 of the Workplace Relations Amendment (Work Choices) Act 2005 and s 717 of the WR Act.
(The TRA had the status of an award: see definition of "award" in s 4(1) of the IR Act and, subsequently, s 4(1) of the WR Act prior to its amendment in 2005.
