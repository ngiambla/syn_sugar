 
1 On 14 December 2005 the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority ("APRA") commenced a proceeding in this Court seeking interim, interlocutory and final relief against Mr David Robert Siminton.
On 21 December 2005 APRA filed a statement of claim in which it was alleged that Mr Siminton had, in various ways, contravened provisions of the Banking Act 1959 (Cth) ("the Act ").
On 15 January 2002 Mr Siminton had registered a business name under Victorian legislation.
That business name was "Principality of Camside".
Later he established a website which advised readers that the Principality had a "new bank" which was to be known as the "Terra Nova Cache".
Mr Siminton addressed a number of public meetings in which he encouraged those present to deposit funds with the "new bank".
He succeeded in persuading a considerable number of people to place their funds in the "bank".
Upon becoming aware of these events APRA filed the application which initiated this proceeding.
