 Background 
 
1 Before the Court are two proceedings that were heard together.
In the first (VID 713 of 2004) the applicant seeks orders that various assessments and notices of assessment are void.
In the second (VID 1095 of 2006) the Commissioner seeks judgment against the applicant for amounts of tax alleged to be unpaid.
Statement of claim in VID 713 of 2004 
 
2 The applicant's statement of claim alleges that:
 
 (a) On or about 11 February 2003, in purported exercise of the powers conferred by s 167 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (Cth) (the Act), the respondent (the Commissioner) purported to make assessments of the applicant's taxable income for the years of income ended 30 June 1998, 2000, 2001 and 2002.
(b) On or about 13 February 2003 the Commissioner posted to the applicant purported notices of assessment for each of the years in (a).
(c) In making the purported assessments the Commissioner made no assessment of a kind authorised by s 167 of the Act.
(d) In making the purported assessments the Commissioner did not attempt bona fide and in good faith to make any assessment of a kind authorised by s 167.
(e) In making each of the purported assessments the Commissioner did not make an assessment other than a tentative or provisional assessment of an amount to be assessed.
(f) In the premises each of the purported assessments was not authorised by s 167 , was not the result of a bona fide attempt to exercise the power in that section, and was the exercise of the power conferred by the section for an improper and collateral purpose.


3 There are particulars of the allegation in [2(c)] which are repeated by reference in connection with the allegations in [2(d) and (e)].The particulars relating to the 1998, 2000 and 2001 years are that the Commissioner:
 
 (a) did no more than add up amounts of money recorded in bank statements as having been deposited into bank accounts operated for the applicant;
 (b) made no, or no genuine, attempt to ascertain whether those amounts were derived by the applicant as income; and
 (c) purported to assess the total of those moneys as an amount upon which income tax ought to be levied on the applicant: 

(i) when he knew or ought to have known that that amount could not possibly be a correct or accurate estimate of the taxable income of the applicant;
 
(ii) when he did not have any, or any reasonable, grounds for believing that the deposits represented income of the applicant;
 
(iii) when he did not have any, or any reasonable, ground for assessing the money as an amount upon which income tax ought to be levied on the applicant; and
 
(iv) with the object of creating a device (namely an income tax assessment) which could be used, in conjunction with a notice under s 260 -5 of Schedule 1 of the Taxation Administration Act 1953 (Cth) (the TAA), to prevent the sum of approximately $592,000 being returned to the applicant by officers of the Queensland Police, by whom it had been seized (the Queensland Cash).
4 The particulars relating to the 2002 year essentially repeat those in [3(a), (b) and (c)(i), (ii) and (iii)] save that in relation to the 2002 year the words "amounts of money" in (a) are replaced by "the Queensland Cash and amounts of money", and the words "total of those moneys" in (c) are replaced by "total of those amounts of Queensland Cash and bank deposits".
In par (c)(iv) the words "to prevent ... Queensland Cash" are replaced by "to prevent the Queensland Cash from being returned to the applicant by officers of the Queensland Police".
5 Save to say that on or about 11 February 2003 he made default assessments of the applicant's taxable income under s 167 of the Act in respect of the relevant years, and on or about that date posted notices of assessment in respect of those years, the Commissioner denies the allegations in the statement of claim.
Applicant's evidence 
 
6 The applicant's evidence consists of his affidavit in support of the application and some discovered documents.
The evidence can be summarised as follows:
 
 (a) On 20 April 2002 the applicant was arrested in Queensland in possession of approximately $620,000 in cash and charged with possession of property reasonably suspected of being tainted and drug related offences.
(b) On approximately 21 April 2002, without the applicant's permission, the Queensland Police placed the money in a bank account.
(c) On 30 November 2002 the Magistrates Court at Cairns dismissed all charges against the applicant.
(d) The police appealed to the Cairns District Court against the dismissal of the charges.
(e) A file note made on 21 January 2003 by Alan Saunders, a Tax Office employee, discloses that the applicant's address was changed on a bank statement from 84 Hamilton Street, Yarraville to 7 Burton Crescent, Maribyrnong in June/July 2000.
(f) A file note made by Mr Saunders on 24 January 2003 records that he had been advised by his teamleader to ensure that garnishee action will be taken in respect of the money held by the Police, and that "Judge is to hand down a decision about the money being returned to Henderson on 12 February 2003".
(g) An email sent by Mr Saunders to Rhonda Lynch (a Tax Office Accounts Receivable Officer) on 3 February 2003 records that "Assuming all goes well with the keying/processing the debt will be on the system by this Friday" (7 February 2003).
(h) Also on 3 February 2003 the Commissioner requested a property search of the Yarraville property.
(i) On 5 February 2003 the Commissioner issued a garnishee notice to the property officer of the Cairns Police Station requiring the officer, as a person who owes or may owe money to the applicant, to pay the sum of $919,051.50 to the Commissioner, or if the money in his hands was less than that, then the whole of the available money.
(j) On the same day the Commissioner sent a letter to the applicant at the Maribyrnong address stating that s 167 assessments had been prepared and would be forwarded without further notice.
The letter did not mention the garnishee notice.
(k) On the same day the Commissioner sent a letter to the applicant at the Yarraville address informing him that the attached garnishee notice had been issued to the Police.
(l) On 6 February 2003 the result of the property search sought in (h) was returned showing that the applicant had transferred his interest in the Yarraville property to his wife in August 1999, the consideration for the sale being "natural love and affection".
(m) On 10 February 2003 the Queensland Director of Public Prosecutions made a successful ex parte application to restrain any dealings with the $620,000.
(n) At 10:30 am on 11 February 2003 the applicant spoke to Gary Wicks, a Tax Office employee filling in for Mr Saunders who was on leave, who said he would chase up the file and ring back.
(o) A file note made on 11 February shows that Mr Wicks rang the applicant back at 3:20 pm, the applicant was not available, and Mr Wicks left a message.
