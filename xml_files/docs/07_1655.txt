 INTRODUCTION 
 
1 This proceeding arises out of a fraud committed on the applicant, Colonial Mutual Superannuation Pty Ltd (Colonial).
By the fraud, Colonial was induced to cause a cheque in the sum of $438,802.80 to be drawn in favour of Stanley G. Stevens.
The cheque was sent to the respondent, Mr Lorenzo Flammia, a solicitor.
Colonial believed that it had been instructed to act in that way by Mr Stanley Gordon Stevens, who was a member of the SuperTrace Eligible Rollover Fund (the SuperTrace Fund), a superannuation fund of which Colonial was the trustee.
In fact, Mr Stevens had given no such instructions.
2 Mr Flammia paid the cheque into his firm's trust account.
He subsequently drew a cheque on that account for the vast bulk of the amount of the bank cheque.
The trust account cheque was made payable to Alliance Property Investments Pty Limited (Alliance) and was paid into an account of Alliance with Westpac Banking Corporation.
The proceeds of the trust account cheque were withdrawn in cash several days later.
3 Colonial commenced a proceeding against Mr Flammia to recover the sum of $438,802.80, together with interest.
The basis for Colonial's claim against Mr Flammia did not originally include a cause of action in deceit.
4 However, Mr Flammia sought indemnity from the cross respondent, LawCover Insurance Pty Limited (LawCover), under a professional indemnity policy of insurance (the Policy) that was in force between LawCover and Mr Flammia at the relevant time.
By the Policy, LawCover agreed to indemnify Mr Flammia against civil liability for any claim that arises from his legal practice and that is first made against him during the period of insurance.
However, the Policy provides that LawCover will not indemnify Mr Flammia for a claim that arises from any dishonest or fraudulent acts or omissions on his part whether directly or indirectly.
5 Since LawCover did not accept liability to indemnify under the Policy, Mr Flammia filed a cross claim against LawCover.
Colonial's claim was first made during the currency of the Policy and LawCover admitted that the claim by Colonial against Mr Flammia in the proceeding is a claim that arises from Mr Flammia's legal practice within the meaning of the Policy.
However, in its defence, LawCover denied liability to indemnify Mr Flammia on the ground that the claim in respect of which indemnity was sought arose from dishonest or fraudulent acts or omissions on the part of Mr Flammia.
After LawCover filed that defence, Colonial amended its statement of claim to include an allegation of deceit against Mr Flammia.
THE ISSUE 
 
6 After all the evidence in Colonial's case and all the evidence in LawCover's case had been adduced, Mr Flammia asked the Court to rule that he had no case to answer in deceit.
Having regard to the allegations of fraud made against Mr Flammia and since there was no effective opposition to the course, I have heard full submissions from the parties on the question of whether Mr Flammia has a case to answer in deceit, without requiring Mr Flammia to make an election as to whether or not to adduce evidence.
7 In its amended statement of claim, Colonial alleges that, by reason of conduct on the part of Mr Flammia alleged by LawCover, Mr Flammia knowingly and falsely made misrepresentations to Colonial, by reason of which Mr Flammia is liable in deceit to Colonial for the loss and damage suffered by Colonial as a consequence of the alleged conduct.
The conduct alleged concerned the involvement of Mr Flammia in the preparation of documents that led ultimately to Colonial arranging for the bank cheque in the sum of $438,802.80 to be sent to Mr Flammia.
8 The question that I am considering at this stage is whether there is presently no evidence at all to support the case of deceit against Mr Flammia or, alternatively, whether such evidence as there is of deceit is so inherently unreliable or equivocal that the Court should be satisfied that Colonial has not discharged the relevant burden of proof ( Prentice v Cummins [2002] FCA 1503 ; (2002) 124 FCR 67 at [109] ).
Since the only issue in the cross-claim is whether Colonial's claim arose out of dishonest or fraudulent acts or omissions on the part of Mr Flammia, a similar question arises in relation to LawCover's defence to Mr Flammia's cross-claim.
9 When the proceeding was commenced by Colonial, Mr William Anastasiadis, a director of Alliance, was joined as second respondent in the proceeding.
However, a compromise was subsequently reached between Colonial and Mr Anastasiadis and it is therefore not necessary to deal with the allegations that have been made by Colonial against him, except in so far as they are material to the question of whether Mr Flammia has a case to answer in deceit.
THE FRAUD 
 
10 Mr Flammia conducted his practice as a solicitor under the name Manna  Flammia from an office in Castlereagh Street, Penrith, New South Wales.
On 11 October 2001, Mr Flammia wrote to Colonial on his firm's letterhead.
The letter was addressed to Colonial at an address in Parramatta.
The letter was entitled " STANLEY STEVENS: MEMBER No TRAC353913 "; that was the membership number of Mr Stanley Gordon Stevens in the SuperTrace Fund.
The letter said:
 
 "We note we act for Mr Stevens.

 
 We are instructed to withdraw our client's superannuation from the fund as he has retired and is no longer working.

 
 Please find enclosed signed ETP form and client's authority.

 
 Please forward a cheque in favour of ' Manna  Flammia Solicitors Trust Account' in the sum of $449,025.01 as soon as possible.

 
 Should you have any queries please contact the writer.
" 
 

The letter was received by Colonial on 15 October 2001.
Three documents were enclosed with the letter.
11 The first document was a copy of a letter dated 2 October 2001 purporting to be written by Stanley G. Stevens to Mr Flammia.
The letter stated the following address for Mr Stevens:
 
 "18 Abercombe St 
 Warrnambool 3280 
 PO Box 399 VIC" 
 

 The letter said as follows:
 
 "As I intend to move to Sydney permanently to live in the near future I would like to appoint you as my legal representative.

 
 You are hereby authorised and instructed to act on my behalf finalising my superannuation fund.

 
 All monies is [sic] to be paid directly into your trust account and held there until further instructed by me.

 
 The details of my ETP will be faxed to you together with this authority letter.

 
 Should you need to discuss this matter with me you can contact me on my mobile number which is 0412-427-400.

 
 I would greatly appreciate all correspondence regarding this matter to be held by yourself as I am currently moving around Australia with work.

 
 Thanking you for your support in this matter.
" 
 

 While the post office box stated in letter of 2 October 2001 was correct for Mr Stanley Gordon Stevens, the street address was fictitious.
Further, at all relevant times during 2001 and 2002, mobile number 0412 427 400 (the Bogus Stevens Number) was held in the name of Ms Helen Oliver of Coorparoo, Queensland.
Mr Stanley Gordon Stevens had no connection with the number.
The letter of 2 October 2001 was purportedly signed by Mr S.G. Stevens.
The signature was a forgery.
Significantly, the signature had an apostrophe between the " n " and the final " s " of the name Stevens.
12 The second document was headed " ETP Pre-Payment Statement - Superannuation Payer ".
That document contained relevant particulars of Mr Stanley G. Stevens, including the post office box at Warrnambool.
Details of the eligible termination payment to which Mr Stevens was entitled, calculated to 13 September 2001, were inserted in the appropriate spaces in the document.
The amount was $449,025.01.
13 The third document was entitled " Individual's Payment Instructions to the Superannuation Payer ".
That form was completed in typescript with details of the name of Mr Stanley G. Stevens and his date of birth.
Particulars of Mr Flammia's firm and its address were inserted in handwriting in the spaces for the name of an agent.
The amount of $449,025.01 was inserted in handwriting in the appropriate space for the amount of the payment requested.
The document was purportedly signed by Mr S.G. Stevens.
Again, the signature had an apostrophe between the " n " and the final " s " of the name Stevens.
The signature was a forgery.
14 In fact, Mr Stanley Gordon Stevens had given no instructions to Manna  Flammia to withdraw his entitlement to superannuation from the SuperTrace Fund.
He knew nothing of Manna  Flammia.
15 On 18 October 2001, Mr Flammia telephoned Colonial's office.
He was told that his letter of 11 October 2001 had been received and that it would be fifteen to twenty working days before the matter would be finalised.
16 A Colonial internal audit trail in respect of the letter of 11 October 2001 contains the following note dated 24 October 2001:
 
 "Ange, could you have a look at this one?
The member has requested payment to a trust account.
Can we do this?
Also, the amount is almost half a million with no cert id.
If you have a look at SAS notes, it was requested for the dob, but not the balance.
The member's dob has been changed (incorrectly), but I do not know if cert id was rec'd.
Nothing on slims.
" 
 

That note indicates that the relevant officer of Colonial required further identification before authorising the payment requested by Mr Flammia's letter of 11 October 2001.
17 On 30 October 2001, Mr Flammia telephoned Colonial again.
He asked if the money payable to Mr Stevens could be credited to a solicitor's trust account.
Mr Flammia was told that that was not possible.
Mr Flammia also asked whether a cheque could be sent to his office and was told that that was possible, if requested by the member in writing.
During that conversation Mr Flammia was requested to provide a certificate of identification.
18 Later on 30 October 2001, Mr Flammia wrote to Colonial again.
The letter was headed in the same way as the letter of 11 October 2001 and said:
 
 "We refer to our letter of 11 October 2001.

 
 Please find enclosed certified identification as requested.

 
 As previously advised, please forward cheque care of this office as soon as possible.

 
 Should you have any queries please contact the writer.
" 
 

That letter was received by Colonial on 31 October 2001.
19 Enclosed with the letter of 30 October 2001 was a single sheet (the 30 October Certificate) containing what purported to be photocopies of three cards in the name of Stanley G. Stevens.
The first card was a National Australia Bank FlexiCard.
The second was a Medicare card.
The third was a New South Wales driver's licence showing an address in Merrylands Road, Merrylands, New South Wales.
All three cards were bogus.
20 The copies of the three cards in the 30 October Certificate are by no means clear although they are just legible, indicating they are several generations of photocopy away from any original.
On the bottom half of the 30 October Certificate was a handwritten note as follows:
 
 "I Lorenzo Flammia Solicitor do hereby certify the above documents to be true copies of the originals.

 
 30 October 2001" 
 

That was followed by a signature which, on the face of it, appears to be very similar to Mr Flammia's signature on the letter of 30 October 2001.
21 An internal memorandum of Colonial for 5 November 2001 records " Cert id recvd OK for bp ".
That would appear to record receipt by Colonial of a document that satisfied the request for a certificate of identification referred to in Colonial's note of 24 October 2001 and requested of Mr Flammia in the conversation of 30 October 2001.
It is clear that the 30 October Certificate was treated by Colonial as satisfying that requirement.
22 An internal Colonial payment requisition form, which was endorsed urgent , was prepared on 9 November 2001 and, pursuant to that requisition a bank cheque was drawn by Commonwealth Bank of Australia in the sum of $438, 802.80 on 9 November 2001.
On the same day, Colonial sent a letter dated 8 November 2001 addressed to Mr Stanley G Stevens at the address of Manna  Flammia.
The letter relevantly said:
 
 "We refer to your request to withdraw your benefit from the above fund.
