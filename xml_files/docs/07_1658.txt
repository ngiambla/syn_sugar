 HIS HONOUR 
 
1 Before the Court there are three proceedings.
The first is ACD 21 of 2007, which is convenient to see as an appeal against a judgment of the Federal Magistrates Court given by Federal Magistrate Mowbray in proceedings in that Court numbered CAG 17 of 2007 on 21 May 2007.
His Honour dismissed an application by the appellant, Mr Fitzpatrick, to have a bankruptcy notice issued against him set aside.
2 Another proceeding is ACD 23 of 2007, which is convenient to see as an appeal against the judgment of Mowbray FM in proceedings numbered CAG 11 of 2007 in the Federal Magistrates Court by which his Honour made a sequestration order against Mr Fitzpatrick's estate on 22 May 2007.
3 The third proceeding before this Court is ACD 22 of 2007, and it appears to be some generalised application for, among other things, the setting aside of the orders appealed against.
As far as I can see, the only matter the application raises that the appeals do not is whether there should be some stay of the operation of the orders made by Mowbray FM which have been variously appealed against.
4 In relation to ACD 22 of 2007 the respondent sought that it be struck out after another judge, who looked at the matter for the purpose of giving directions, expressed a preliminary view that it might be incompetent.
I have refrained from striking it out because it does raise the question of a stay.
For reasons that will emerge, there is no basis for or sense in granting any stay.
5 In relation to the question of setting aside the bankruptcy notice, his Honour's reasons appear to be correct for the reasons that he gave.
The bankruptcy notice was indeed, as his Honour explained, founded on a final judgment or final order for the requisite amount within the meaning of s 41(1) of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth) ('the Act'), and it was not shown that Mr Fitzpatrick had such a counter-claim, set-off or cross demand, as would warrant the setting aside of the bankruptcy notice.
Again his Honour, it seems to me, unexceptionably, explained why that is so.
