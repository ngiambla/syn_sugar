 BACKGROUND 
 
1 This is an appeal from a judgment of the Federal Magistrates Court.
2 The first, second and third appellants arrived in Australia on 13 February 2004.
The first and second appellants are husband and wife, and the third and fourth appellants are their daughters.
On 26 March 2004, these appellants lodged an application for a protection visa with the first respondent's Department.
On 21 May 2004, a delegate of the first respondent refused to grant them protection visas.
On 19 June 2004, the first, second and third appellants applied to the Refugee Review Tribunal for review of the delegate's decision.
3 The fourth appellant was born in Australia on 15 September 2004.
On 15 October 2004, an application for a protection visa was also lodged on her behalf, and was refused by the delegate on 22 October 2004.
On 8 November 2004, an application for review was lodged with the Tribunal on the fourth appellant's behalf.
4 The Tribunal affirmed the delegate's decisions in a decision handed down on 16 February 2005.
On 10 March 2005, the appellants applied to the Federal Magistrates Court for judicial review.
On 5 October 2006, a Federal Magistrate delivered judgment dismissing this application with costs.
On 20 October 2006, the appellants filed their notice of appeal against his Honour's decision.
This is the appeal with which I am presently concerned.
THE TRIBUNAL'S DECISION 
 
5 The Tribunal accepted that the appellants were citizens of Bangladesh.
Before the Tribunal, the first appellant claimed that he was a Bangladeshi businessman and a member of the Jatiya Party.
He claimed that he became popular in his local area and, on account of this and his profile, he was assigned to organise party meetings, public relations, make public statements, and encourage and recruit members.
He claimed that the local Awami League and Bangladesh National Party ("BNP") leaders did not approve of his activities, and tried to destroy his political career and business.
6 The first appellant claimed that, in 1991, he was harassed by local BNP "terrorists", who tortured him and demanded money in exchange for allowing him to conduct his business.
As result, he was forced to relocate to Dhaka.
When the Awami League came to power in 1996, he returned to his local area to restart his business.
He claimed that the Awami League came to power with the support of the Jatiya Party, but that the Awami League betrayed the Jatiya Party.
The Awami League people warned him to stop his political activities and demanded money from him.
He claimed that he was forced to move back to Dhaka in 1998 "to save his life".
7 The first appellant claimed that, when the BNP again came to power in 2001, he did not return to his local area as BNP "terrorists" were looking for him and wanted him killed.
He claimed that they came to his house in Dhaka and, when they found he was not there, they told his wife that they would return.
He claimed that the police would not assist him because they were controlled by the BNP and the Awami League.
He claimed that false charges were laid against him, and he feared harassment by the authorities.
He claimed that he was denied food, shelter, livelihood, freedom, safety and security.
He claimed that if he returned to Bangladesh he would be killed, and he also feared for his family's safety.
8 The second, third and fourth appellants made no separate claims and relied on those of the first appellant.
9 On 29 November 2004, the Tribunal received a further statement signed by the first appellant.
This statement, which stated his address as 16A Station Street, Marrickville, NSW, reiterated the claims contained in a statement submitted with his protection visa application.
This address was the residential and mailing address that the appellants had provided to the Tribunal in relation to their review application.
On 25 October 2004, the Tribunal sent the first, second and third appellants an invitation to this address to attend a hearing on 3 December 2004.
The first and second appellants attended on that day and gave evidence with the assistance of an interpreter.
10 On 22 November 2004, the Tribunal sent the fourth appellant, then an infant, an invitation to attend a hearing on 16 December 2004.
This invitation was also sent by registered post to the 16A Station Street address.
This was the residential and mailing address that had been given to the Tribunal on her behalf.
No-one attended this hearing on the fourth appellant's behalf.
11 The first appellant was given a further opportunity after the hearing to provide medical evidence in support of his claimed medical condition.
On 9 December 2004, the first appellant sought an extension of two weeks to provide a "medical specialist report".
An officer of the Tribunal unsuccessfully sought to contact the appellants on their mobile phone and ultimately responded by letter, stating that it would grant the extension until 17 December 2004.
Subsequent attempts to telephone the appellants also proved unsuccessful.
12 On 17 December 2004, the first appellant left a letter with the Tribunal saying:
 
 With reference to your letter dated 10 December 2004, you have provided additional time till 17 December 2004.
But the Medical specialist Dr. Makram Girgis gave me an appointment on 28 January 2005.

 I would appreciate it if would kindly extend time up to February 2005, so that I can submit medical specialist report.
Appointment card is enclosed for your kind consideration.



The Tribunal was provided with an appointment card from Dr Girgis and a referral letter from Dr Deepak Malhotra, Family Medical Practitioner, dated 14 December 2004, to Dr Girgis.
Also on 17 December 2004, according to the Tribunal's decision, the first appellant had attended the Tribunal's registry and stated that:
 
 [H] e had only received the Tribunal's letter of 10 December 2004 that day and he had not received a card from Australia Post indicating that it had registered mail for him.
He also said that he lived in a residence at the rear of shops so that persons at the shops may handle his mail.



Further, when the first appellant was asked why he did not attend his daughter's hearing the previous day, he stated the he did not receive notification of the hearing.
He was then informed that the invitation had been sent by registered mail.
13 The Tribunal affirmed the delegate's decision because, on the evidence before it, it was unable to be satisfied that the first appellant had a well-founded fear of persecution for a Convention reason.
Hence the Tribunal affirmed the decisions not to grant the appellants protection visas.
14 First, the Tribunal did not accept that the first appellant suffered any medical condition that adversely affected his ability to give evidence at the hearing, as the first appellant claimed.
Secondly, the Tribunal found that the first appellant was not a truthful witness and that he had invented his claims.
In support of this finding, the Tribunal held that the first appellant's evidence was vague and unconvincing, and he lacked knowledge about the political party that he claimed to have been closely involved with for nine years.
The Tribunal found that the first appellant was evasive, and his claims were internally inconsistent, not supported by independent evidence, and implausible.
Additionally, the Tribunal found that the evidence given by the second appellant was given in "an unconfident and nervous manner".
It held that "much of what she said added little support to the claims of the first named [appellant]" and lacked detail.
The Tribunal found that it was not plausible that the first appellant would have been targeted by the Awami League in 1996 or 1997, as he claimed; and that the first appellant's claim that BNP "terrorists" came to his house in December 2003 to kill him was also implausible "given that on his own account he had not been politically active since 1998".
Ultimately, the Tribunal found that the first appellant was not a credible witness and did not accept that he was a member of the Jatiya Party or that he suffered harm as a result of his alleged involvement with the Party.
THE FEDERAL MAGISTRATE'S DECISION 
 
15 In an amended application for judicial review, the appellants challenged the Tribunal's decision on the following grounds:
 
 In making the decision the Tribunal made a jurisdictional error by denying the applicant procedural fairness.

 Particulars 
 
 
 (a) The Tribunal made adverse findings as to the authenticity of an arrest warrant, court case, medical reports provided by the applicant.

 (b) The Tribunal failed to make a proper disclosure of adverse information.

 (c) The Tribunal did not afford the applicant the opportunity to put their [sic] case as required because the first named applicant was sick and was unable to remember or answer the questioned [sic] raised by the tribunal member.

 
 
 
 In making the decision the Tribunal made a jurisdictional error by violating the duty it was under in satisfying itself as to eligibility of the applicants for protections visas.

 Particulars 
 
 
 (a) The Tribunal made adverse findings as to the authenticity of documents provided by the applicant.

 
 
 (b) The findings were not based on evidence.

 
 In making the decision the Tribunal made a jurisdictional error by denying [or] misapplying the law.

 Particulars 
 
 
 (a) The Tribunal made adverse findings as to the availability to the applicant of protection from persecution.

 (b) The Tribunal based that decision upon the ability to escape persecution by taking reasonable steps to avoid it.

 (c) That is not the test.

 (d) The findings of the availability of protection were not based on evidence.

 


 
16 An affidavit of Zoe Elizabeth Brauer sworn on 6 September 2006 was admitted into evidence.
The transcript of the Tribunal hearing of 3 December 2004 was attached to Ms Brauer's affidavit.
The Federal Magistrate dealt with the matters that the appellants presented, acknowledging that they did not correlate with the grounds set out in their application, original or amended.
17 The Federal Magistrate rejected a contention about an arrest warrant because the issue of an arrest warrant never arose before the Tribunal.
The Federal Magistrate found that, contrary to the appellants' unparticularised contention, to the extent that the Tribunal relied on independent country information, it was not required to give the appellants details of that information because information of this kind fell within s 424A(3)(a) of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) ("the Act ").
His Honour noted the appellants' submission that the Tribunal did not give the first appellant the opportunity to provide medical evidence to show that his brain condition adversely affected his ability to give evidence.
His Honour found that the first appellant was given a reasonable opportunity to present medical evidence supporting his claims and that the Tribunal did not accept the first appellant's claim, as it was entitled to do.
His Honour also rejected a contention about the authenticity of documents on the basis that the Tribunal made no relevant finding and the appellants did not provide any documents to the Tribunal that could have given rise to such a finding.
Similarly, his Honour found that, despite the appellants' claims, the Tribunal made no findings in connection with the ability of the appellants to obtain state or any other protection.
18 Accordingly, the Federal Magistrate held that there were no grounds to suggest that the Tribunal made any jurisdictional error in its decision making process.
APPEAL TO THIS COURT 
 
19 The appellants appealed to this Court on the following grounds:
 
 1.
The Refugee Review Tribunal constructively failed to exercise its jurisdiction under the Act : 
 
 Particulars: 
 A.
There was no evidence to support the Refugee Review Tribunal's finding that: 
 i) the first named applicant was given a reasonable opportunity after the hearing to present medical evidence to support his claim that he had a condition which would have affected his ability to give evidence but has failed to do so.

 
 2.
The Refugee Review Tribunal acted in excess of its jurisdiction: 
 
 Particulars: 
 A.
There was no evidence to support the Refugee Review Tribunal's finding that: 
 i) the first named applicant was not suffering from any condition during the hearing which adversely affected his ability to give evidence.

 
 3.
The Refugee Review Tribunal did not give any weight to the second applicant's evidence: 
 
 Particulars 
 A.
There was no evidence to support that the Tribunal gave weight to the second applicant's evidence: 
 i) the Tribunal has decided to give her evidence no weight because it found the first named applicant a thoroughly unreliable witness.

 
 4.
The Refugee Review Tribunal made a wrong assumption on its decision by saying that the first named applicant had been a member of the Jatiya Party since 1985 but that is inconsistent with the independent information: 
 
 Particulars 
 A.
There was no evidence to support the Refugee Review Tribunal's finding that: 
 i) the date of the applicant's involvement with the Jatiya Party was inconsistent with the independent information before the Tribunal.



 
20 The appellants filed written submissions in support of these grounds.
