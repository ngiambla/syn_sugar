 INTRODUCTION 
 
1 In August 2006 Finland applied to the Attorney-General of the Commonwealth to extradite Jan Tervonen, one of its nationals, in respect of eight warrants for his arrest.
The warrants had been issued by the Helsinki and the Tuusula District Courts between 2004 and 2006.
The request was considered by the then Minister for Justice and Customs, Senator the Honourable Christopher Ellison.
He gave a notice in writing under s 16(1) of the Extradition Act 1988 (Cth) on 18 August 2006 that he had received an extradition request from Finland for a considerable number, but not all, of the offences specified in the eight warrants.
Senator Ellison's notice contained 56 numbered paragraphs which referred to 77 separate offences.
2 Later in 2006, Mr Tervonen commenced these proceedings, challenging Senator Ellison's notice.
I refused interlocutory relief on the basis of Mr Tervonen's challenges, as then formulated by him when he was self-represented: Tervonen v Minister for Justice and Customs [2007] FCA 464.
Shortly after I delivered my judgment, the Full Court of this Court handed down its decision in Williams v Minister for Justice and Customs (2007) 157 FCR 286.
I then appointed counsel under O 80 of the Federal Court Rules 2001 (Cth) to represent Mr Tervonen on the final hearing.
His counsel has reformulated Mr Tervonen's claims.
3 On 30 April 2007, before the date of the final hearing, Senator Ellison's successor in the office of Minister for Justice and Customs, Senator the Honourable David Johnston, signed what was intituled 'Amended Notice of Receipt of Extradition Request' under s 16(1) of the Act.
That second s 16 notice was given in respect of all of the original offences in Senator Ellison's notice together with seven further ones identified in its paragraphs (57) and (58).
4 Mr Tervonen has challenged the validity of each s 16 notice.
He argued that Senator Ellison's s 16 notice was invalid because:
 
 
 (1) the Minister did not have before him any statement of Mr Tervonen's conduct or his acts or omissions and so Senator Ellison could not form the opinion which s 16(2)(a)(ii) required, viz, that the same, or equivalent conduct, acts or omissions, if committed in Australia, would have constituted an extradition offence in relation to Australia.
The material before Senator Ellison was thus said to be so deficient (relying on Williams 157 FCR at 297 [45]) that the Minister could not have formed the opinion which s 16(2)(a)(ii) required;
 (2) the language of the Finnish warrants on their face was incapable of satisfying the definition of 'extraditable person' in s 6(a)(i) of the Act because they did not, in terms, seek his arrest as a person actually charged or accused of an offence.
Rather, they sought his arrest on the basis that they alleged that he was 'suspected with probable cause' of having committed one or a number of offences.
Mr Tervonen said that the Minister could not have formed the opinion required under s 16(2)(a)(ii) in the absence of any material before him to establish that the formulation used in each of the Finnish warrants was in fact a warrant within s 6(a)(i);
 (3) Article 7(2) of the Treaty between Australia and Finland Concerning Extradition done at Helsinki on 7 June 1984 as amended by Article 3 of the Protocol between Australia and Finland Amending the Treaty Concerning Extradition done at Helsinki on 10 September 1985 contained in Schedule 2 of the Extradition (Finland) Regulations 1988 (Cth) required Finland to accompany its request for his extradition with a statement of each offence for which extradition was sought together with a statement of the acts or omissions which were alleged against Mr Tervonen in respect of each offence.
Mr Tervonen argued that because in August 2006 Senator Ellison personally did not have before him all of this material, as required by the treaty, he could not issue the notice.

 

5 However, Mr Tervonen's principal challenge was against Senator Johnston's s 16 notice.
He argued that:
 
 
 (1) Senator Johnston as Minister for Justice and Customs was not able to exercise the statutory powers and functions specifically conferred on the Attorney-General by s 16 of the Act;
 (2) under the Act it is not open for the Attorney-General, or the Minister administering the Act, to issue a second notice in respect of the same request;
 (3) the particularisation of his acts and omissions in the material before Senator Johnston relating to pars (24)-(52), (57) and (58) of the second s 16 notice was insufficient to enable the Minister to form the opinion required under s 16(2)(a)(ii), so that the whole notice was invalid or those paragraphs were;
 (4) the language of the Finnish warrants was incapable of satisfying the statutory definition of 'extraditable person' on the same basis as ground (2) in respect of Senator Ellison's s 16 notice.
