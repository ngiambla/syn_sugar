 
1 This is an application pursuant to Pt 16 Workplace Relations Act 1996 (Cth) ("the Act ") brought by the Construction Forestry, Mining and Energy Union ("CFMEU") ("the applicant") on behalf of two individuals, Mr James McIlroy and Ms Anita St Henry, to whom I shall refer collectively as "the employees" where appropriate.
Mr McIlroy and Ms St Henry were employed by CE Marshall  Sons Pty Ltd ("the respondent") at Blackwater Mine during the period 15 February 2006 to 10 May 2006.
Their employment was terminated on 10 May 2006.
The applicant asserts that the respondent dismissed the employees for a prohibited reason, namely because they were members of an industrial association and/or because as members of an industrial association they did an act for the purposes of furthering or protecting the industrial interests of the applicant, which act was both lawful and within the limits of an authority expressly conferred by the applicant under its rules.
