2 The appellant in the proceedings has failed to appear.
3 The matter was listed for hearing at 2.15pm today and it is now 2.32pm and the appellant, although called, has failed to appear.
The Federal Court Registry sent a letter to the appellant on 20 September 2007 advising the appellant of the place, date and time for the hearing of the appeal and that letter was sent to the address for service nominated by the appellant in the notice of appeal filed on 2 July 2007.
4 In addition to that letter, the solicitors for the respondents, Blake Dawson Waldron, wrote a letter to the appellant at the same address enclosing a copy of the first respondent's outline of submissions.
That letter is dated 2 November 2007 and those letters have been marked Exhibits 1 and 2 in the proceeding.
5 By reason of the failure of the appellant to appear, the first respondent moves for an order pursuant to s 25(2B)(bb) for an order of the Court dismissing the appeal.
6 In view of the failure to appear, I order that the appeal is dismissed with costs.
I certify that the preceding six (6) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Greenwood.
