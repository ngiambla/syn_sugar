 
1 This is an appeal from the decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT) constituted by Deputy President Hack, given on 12 May 2006, in which the AAT affirmed the decision of the Social Security Appeals Tribunal ("SSAT") of 18 October 2005.
The SSAT had set aside the decision of the Secretary, Department of Workplace Relations (the "applicant") and returned the matter for reconsideration in accordance with a direction that, for the purposes of calculating her entitlement to a Centrelink parenting payment, the income of the respondent did not include amounts repaid by her to her employer in accordance with the terms of her employment contract.

1.
The appeal be allowed.
2.
The decision of the AAT be set aside and the decision of the Authorised Review Officer of Centrelink be affirmed.
3.
Alternatively, that decision of the AAT and the matter be remitted to the AAT to be determined according to law.
4.
Such further orders as the Court sees fit.
