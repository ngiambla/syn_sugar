 
1 On 26 October 2007 I delivered judgment in this proceeding: see Australian Prudential Regulation Authority v Siminton (No 6) [2007] FCA 1608.
I found that Mr Siminton was a person who had carried on and was proposing to carry on the business of banking in Australia and that such conduct constituted or would constitute a contravention of s 7 of the Banking Act 1959 (Cth) ("the Act ").
I also found that Mr Siminton had engaged in conduct which contravened s 66 of the Act .
I foreshadowed making injunctive orders to restrain Mr Siminton from engaging in further contraventions of the Act and orders appointing a receiver to identify the persons who had made deposits in the "bank" established by Mr Siminton, to get in the funds which were the subject of an order, made by Gray J on 10 January 2006, and to provide for an orderly and equitable distribution of those funds to depositors.
I listed the matter for mention on 7 November 2007.
On that day I made the foreshadowed orders.
