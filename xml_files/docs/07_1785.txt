 
1 Upon ordering the winding up of Australvic Property Management Pty Ltd ('APM') on 5 October 2007, I ordered that each party, each supporting creditor, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission ('ASIC') and Saxbys Lawyers ('Saxbys') file with the Court and serve on each other written submissions as to costs and that leave be granted to the liquidator (if so advised) to file with the Court and serve on each party, each supporting creditor, the ASIC and Saxbys, any written submissions as to costs.
2 Pursuant to these orders I have received written submissions from the plaintiffs, T  G Welding Pty Ltd ('T  G Welding') (a supporting creditor), ASIC, and Saxbys.
