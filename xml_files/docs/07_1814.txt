 
1 On 7 November 2007 I found that Mr Siminton had committed eight contempts of Court involving contraventions of an order made by Gray J on 10 January 2006: see Australian Prudential Regulation Authority v Siminton (No 7) [2007] FCA 1609.
These reasons should be read in conjunction with those in Siminton (No 7) .
2 Gray J's order restrained Mr Siminton from dealing with, withdrawing or disposing of moneys held in various accounts.
The contempts were committed when Mr Siminton either caused the funds to be transferred from such accounts into an account held by a Mr  Mrs Holzheimer in the Bank of Adelaide or he withdrew transferred funds from the Holzheimer's account.
Mrs Holzheimer had obtained a Visa card which she provided to Mr Siminton.
The card enabled Mr Siminton to draw on the account at automatic teller machines and, by presenting the card, to undertake credit card transactions with merchants.
He used the card for these purposes.
3 Charges 1.1 to 1.5 related to transfers into the Holzheimer's account from a Mobile EFT Pty Ltd account controlled by Mr Siminton.
