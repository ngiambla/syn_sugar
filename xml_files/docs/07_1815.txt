 
1 On 7 November 2007 I found that Mr Siminton had committed contempt of Court by failing to pay a fine imposed on him by a Full Court within the time stipulated by the Full Court (which included an additional two weeks allowed by the District Registrar under the Full Court's Order): see Australian Prudential Regulation Authority v Siminton (No 8) [2007] FCA 1612.
These reasons should be read in conjunction with those in Siminton (No 8).

 
2 On 19 July 2006 the Full Court ordered that Mr Siminton pay a fine of $50,000 "within 60 days or such further time and by such instalments as the District Registrar may allow.
" The 60 day period expired on 18 September 2006.
On that day the District Registrar ordered that Mr Siminton be granted a further 14 days within which to make payment.
The extended period expired on 2 October 2006.
The fine was not paid despite the fact that Mr Siminton had the financial capacity to do so, at least in part.
I found that Mr Siminton's failure to make at least a part payment was wilful.
