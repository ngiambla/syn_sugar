 

 Introduction and Overview 
 
1 On 26 July 2004, the first respondent (Bearsden) and the first applicant (Cairnsmore) entered into a sale of business agreement ("The SBA") under which Bearsden purported to sell certain assets of a financial advisory business to Cairnsmore.
2 The intention of the parties was apparently to transfer to Cairnsmore the right to service a number of clients of a financial planning and advisory business carried on at 60 Margaret Street, Sydney.
That right, if effectively transferred, would have carried with it the right to receive the fees (or a proportion of them) paid by the clients for the services.
3 The business with which the parties were attempting to deal was the financial services business, the conduct of which was regulated under Chapter 7 of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth).
However, the SBA purported to effect the sale of assets of the business, without paying attention to the statutory scheme under which the business was conducted.
4 What is more, the SBA purported to effect the sale of a business that Bearsden did not carry on.
The introductory recitals stated falsely that Bearsden carried on the business and that it had the legal ownership.
5 In fact, the business was that of Godfrey Pembroke Limited (GPL), which HBN Financial Management Pty Limited (HBN) conducted as an authorised representative of GPL in accordance with Part 7.6 of the Corporations Act .
6 HBN was the trustee of a discretionary trust.
Bearsden was one of two unit holders in the trust.
The principal of Bearsden, Mr James Pearsen Hodge, was also a personal authorised representative of GPL.
7 There was no contractual relationship between Bearsden and GPL.
Bearsden was merely a recipient of fees earned by HBN as an authorised representative of GPL.
8 Bearsden was the trustee of Mr Hodge's family trust.
Bearsden on-distributed the fees received from HBN to Mr Hodge and other members of his family as beneficiaries of the family trust.
9 The SBA provided for the purchase price to be payable in three instalments.
The first instalment of approximately $351,000 was paid on 27 July 2004.
The second instalment was due on 27 July 2005 and the third instalment 12 months later.
10 Cairnsmore did not hold authorised representative status under the Corporations Act , nor did its principal, Mr Vernon Howland.
However, the SBA provided for Cairnsmore to have possession of the assets purchased on the date of payment of the first instalment.
11 In order to overcome the gap in satisfying the statutory requirements, the SBA anticipated that Mr Howland would undertake the necessary training to obtain authorised representative status.
No period was stipulated for this to occur but the SBA provided for a "transition period" of two years.
During the transition period Bearsden was obliged to assist in the "transition" of clients to Cairnsmore.
12 Provision was made in the SBA for Cairnsmore to obtain office services at the Margaret Street premises occupied by HBN.
Cairnsmore was to pay a monthly fee of $5,800 as its proportion of the costs of the services.
13 Mr Howland was given space, albeit in the photocopy room, from 27 July 2004 and was introduced to clients commencing from that date.
Cairnsmore received fees from that time and also paid its monthly cost allocation.
14 The SBA anticipated a possible change in the identity of the AFS licensee.
That is to say, it was anticipated between the parties that the principal for whom the proper authority-holders were acting as authorised representatives would not be GPL.
15 Bearsden warranted in the SBA that if the identity of the AFS licensee should alter, during the transition period, then Cairnsmore would not be disadvantaged by any such change.
See clause 9, extracted below.
16 With effect from 1 April 2005, HBN and Mr Hodge ceased to be authorised representatives of GPL.
On or about 1 April 2005, Mr Hodge wrote to all of the clients of the business, including those purportedly transferred to Cairnsmore under the SBA, informing them that he would no longer be an authorised representative of GPL.
17 Mr Hodge's letters to the clients stated that he had notified GPL of his resignation "to join a new licensee under the name of, Paragem.
" The letter offered clients the opportunity to remain clients of GPL but it also said:
 
 Unless you advise within 14 days to the contrary, you will be transferred as a client of mine to the Paragem licensee.

 

 
18 The move from GPL to Paragem caused considerable tension between Mr Howland and Mr Hodge.
By letter dated 1 July 2005, the then solicitors for Cairnsmore wrote to Bearsden's solicitors.
The letter stated that Bearsden has repudiated the SBA.
19 Bearsden's solicitors responded to the letter on 18 July 2005, asserting the Cairnsmore had "walked away" from the SBA.
20 Cairnsmore solicitors replied on the same day stating that their instructions were that Cairnsmore accepted Bearsden's repudiation of the SBA and terminated that agreement.
21 The following issues are raised in the proceedings:
 
 
 (i) Whether upon the proper construction of the SBA, Bearsden contracted to sell the assets of the business in which it had no legal or beneficial interest.
(ii) If so, whether Cairnsmore is entitled to damages for breach of contract in accordance with the principles stated by Dixon J and Fullagar J in McRae v Commonwealth Disposals Commission [1950] HCA 12 ; (1951) 84 CLR 377 at 409 --- 415.
(iii) Whether the move from GPL to Paragem constituted the exercise of a "right of title" by Bearsden under cl 5.4 of the SBA, thereby entitling Cairnsmore to a refund of the first instalment and damages for breach of contract.
See McDonald v Dennys Lascelles Limited [1933] HCA 25 ; (1933) 48 CLR 457.
(iv) Whether the move from GPL to Paragem was to the disadvantage of Cairnsmore within the meaning of cl 9.1 of the SBA.
(v) Whether Cairnsmore is entitled to recover damages either in contract or under the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) for expenditure incurred by it in reliance upon representations made by Bearsden in the SBA that it owned and carried on the business and had the right to sell it.
(vi) Whether Cairnsmore and Mr Howland are entitled to recover against Mr Hodge by virtue of ss 6(3) or 75B of the Trade Practices Act .
(vii) Whether, if Cairnsmore's contentions are not correct, Bearsden is entitled to recover payment of the second and third instalments of the purchase price as claimed by it in its cross claim.

 


 The SBA 
 
22 The SBA is a lengthy document.
It was not prepared by solicitors but was adapted by Mr Hodge from another contract that had been drawn by solicitors.
The other contract provided for the purchase by HBN of a financial services business conducted at Milsons Point.
23 The parties to the SBA were Bearsden and Cairnsmore, but Mr Hodge's name appears on the cover sheet.
