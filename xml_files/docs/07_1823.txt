On 24 October 2007, by consent, a declaration of infringement of copyright by Metricon as well as declarations that Palazzesi and Popple authorised such infringement were made.
Those orders were made following my judgment in the matter which was delivered on 28 September 2007: Barrett Property Group Pty Ltd v Metricon Homes Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1509.
The question of costs which was held over for further argument is now before the Court for resolution.
2 The applicants seek an order that costs be taxed and paid forthwith, and that in respect of half of the costs of preparation and trial, these be taxed on an indemnity basis.
The respondents oppose the application but say that if indemnity costs are to be paid then this should be in respect of only 4/13ths of the costs.
The trial took thirteen days.
INDEMNITY COSTS 
 
3 An award of costs is in the discretion of the Court or Judge except as provided by any other Act: Federal Court of Australia Act s 43(2).
The discretion must be exercised judicially.
In the normal course, costs are ordered to be paid on a party and party basis: Colgate-Palmolive Company v Cussons Pty Limited (1993) 46 FCR 225 at 232; Re Wilcox; Ex parte Ventura Industries Pty Ltd (No 2) (1996) 72 FCR 152 at 158 per Cooper and Merkel JJ.
A costs order is not intended to punish the unsuccessful party but rather to compensate the successful party: Hurst and Devlin v Education Queensland (No 2) [2005] FCA 793 at [5] .
This is so even where the ordinary practice is departed from.
The aim is not to punish or deter future litigants but simply to compensate a party fully for costs which normal party-party costs could not be expected to do, where it was unreasonable for that party to be subjected to any expenditure of costs, such as where a hopeless proceeding is brought: Cirillo v Consolidated Press Property Ltd (No 2) [2007] FCA 179 at [4] - [5] .
Any departure from this general rule requires a special reason: Access For All Alliance (Hervey Bay) Inc v Hervey Bay City Council [2007] FCA 974 at [10] ; Pacific Publications Pty Ltd v Next Publishing Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 971 at [5] .
The categories in respect of which departure from the usual rule are contained are not closed: John S Hayes  Associates Pty Limited v Kimberley-Clarke Australia Pty Limited (1994) 52 FCR 203; Jianshe Southern Pty Ltd v Turnbull Cooktown Pty Ltd (No 2) [2007] FCA 903 at [32] .
4 In Colgate-Palmolive, (at p 233) Sheppard J identified various categories which might give rise to an award of indemnity costs.
