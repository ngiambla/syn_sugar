 
1 The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission ("the ACCC") has brought proceedings against some nineteen corporate and individual respondents seeking declaratory and injunctive relief, and pecuniary penalties, for breaches of s 45(2) of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) ("the TPA") and the Victorian Competition Code ("the Code").
The respondents are all, in various ways, connected with the harvesting and supply of unshucked abalone in Victoria.
2 The hearing of this action began on 24 September 2007.
The trial ran for some five days, during which the ACCC presented its entire case.
Its expert witness, Dr Philip Williams, was cross-examined at considerable length, and numerous documents, largely those created by and emanating from the respondents, were tendered.
3 At the conclusion of the ACCC's case, I directed that the matter be referred to the Deputy District Registrar of the Victorian Registry, who had previously conducted a mediation in this proceeding, though unsuccessfully, for further mediation.
I did so because I was told that the trial might continue for a very considerable time, as the respondents were contemplating calling a large number of witnesses.
It seemed to me that, having regard to the way in which the case was proceeding, that would be very costly, and render the proceedings unnecessarily protracted.
As it happened, the second attempt at mediation was successful.
The ACCC and the respondents were able to agree on almost all essential facts, and also upon the form of orders that should be made.
4 On 19 October 2007 I heard final submissions from the parties as to the nature of the orders that would be appropriate.
I reserved my decision.
I now publish my reasons for judgment, and make the orders that I consider are warranted.
THE RELEVANT PROVISIONS OF THE TPA AND THE CODE 
 
5 As is well known, Pt IV of the TPA is directed at restrictive trade practices.
It contains a number of provisions which proscribe and regulate agreements and conduct, and which are aimed at maintaining competition in trade and commerce: see Refrigerated Express Lines (A/asia) Pty Ltd v Australian Meat and Live-Stock Corporation (1980) 29 ALR 333 at 340 per Deane J.
6 The Competition Policy Reform Act 1995 (Vic), which introduced the Code, applies the "Schedule Version of Part IV" of the TPA to all "persons" in Victoria.
7 Section 45 of the TPA, which falls within Pt IV, deals with contracts, arrangements or understandings that restrict dealings or affect competition.
Section 45(2) is in the following terms: 
 
 "A corporation shall not: 
 
 (a) make a contract or arrangement, or arrive at an understanding, if: 
 
 
 
 
 (i) the proposed contract, arrangement or understanding contains an exclusionary provision; or 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (ii) a provision of the proposed contract, arrangement or understanding has the purpose, or would have or be likely to have the effect, of substantially lessening competition; or 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (b) give effect to a provision of a contract, arrangement or understanding, whether the contract or arrangement was made, or the understanding was arrived at, before or after the commencement of this section, if that provision: 
 
 
 
 
 
 (i) is an exclusionary provision; or 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (ii) has the purpose, or has or is likely to have the effect, of substantially lessening competition.
" 
 
 
 

8 Section 45(2) of the Code is in almost identical terms.
The chief difference is that it states that a "person shall not" rather than a "corporation shall not".
9 Section 4D(1) of the TPA defines an exclusionary provision in the following terms: 
 
 "A provision of a contract, arrangement or understanding, or of a proposed contract, arrangement or understanding, shall be taken to be an exclusionary provision for the purposes of this Act if: 
 
 
 
 (a) the contract or arrangement was made, or the understanding was arrived at, or the proposed contract or arrangement is to be made, or the proposed understanding is to be arrived at, between persons any 2 or more of whom are competitive with each other; and 
 
 
 
 
 
 (b) the provision has the purpose of preventing, restricting or limiting: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (i) the supply of goods or services to, or the acquisition of goods or services from, particular persons or classes of persons; or 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (ii) the supply of goods or services to, or the acquisition of goods or services from, particular persons or classes of persons in particular circumstances or on particular conditions; 
 
 
 
 
 by all or any of the parties to the contract, arrangement or understanding or of the proposed parties to the proposed contract, arrangement or understanding or, if a party or proposed party is a body corporate, by a body corporate that is related to the body corporate.
" 
 

10 Section 4D(2) provides a definition of the expression "competitive with each other" for the purposes of s 4D(1).
11 Section 45A(1) contains a deeming provision regarding the purpose or effect mentioned in s 45(2) in the following terms:
 
 "Without limiting the generality of section 45, a provision of a contract, arrangement or understanding, or of a proposed contract, arrangement or understanding, shall be deemed for the purposes of that section to have the purpose, or to have or to be likely to have the effect, of substantially lessening competition if the provision has the purpose, or has or is likely to have the effect, as the case may be, of fixing, controlling or maintaining, or providing for the fixing, controlling or maintaining of, the price for, or a discount, allowance, rebate or credit in relation to, goods or services supplied or acquired or to be supplied or acquired by the parties to the contract, arrangement or understanding or the proposed parties to the proposed contract, arrangement or understanding, or by any of them, or by any bodies corporate that are related to any of them, in competition with each other.
" 
 

12 Section 45A(1) declares, in effect, that price-fixing arrangements are illegal per se.
A provision of a contract, arrangement or understanding will be regarded as a price-fixing provision if it has the purpose or likely effect of, inter alia, fixing, controlling or maintaining the price of goods or services or providing for that to occur.
13 Section 75B of the TPA then provides for derivative liability for individuals involved in contraventions of s 45(2).
14 Any contravention by a person of any of the provisions of Pt IV of the TPA, or the Code, may result in an order by the Court that the person pay to the Commonwealth a pecuniary penalty in respect of each act or omission by that person.
