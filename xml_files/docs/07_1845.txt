1 The parties in this case each sell furniture, including sofas.
They are in competition with each other although they sell in different price ranges.
As this case shows they may be commercially sensitive to each other's marketing efforts.
According to evidence given by Mr Stephen Sheppard, a director of each of the respondents (collectively Dare Gallery), in early 2007 he became aware that the applicant (King Furniture) had embarked on a national television advertising campaign disparaging timber framed sofa products.
Dare Gallery sells such sofas.
King Furniture manufactures and sells sofas with a metal frame construction.
Mr Sheppard described the advertisements in the following way:
 
 'In the King advertisements: 
 
 
 
 (a) A bowling ball is dropped on the springs of both a timber and webbing constructed sofa and King Furniture's sprung steel structure and spring suspension sofa, with the seat cushions removed from both sofas, and the ball is shown bouncing on the King Furniture frame and falling through the webbed frame; and 
 
 
 
 
 
 (b) King Furniture claim that traditional webbing and timber construction sofas (similar to those sold by Dare Gallery) are of an inferior quality to the King Furniture sofas that are constructed using steel frames and sprung steel suspension.
' 
 
 
 

2 According to his evidence, Mr Sheppard decided 'to defend Dare Gallery's position, our construction and our values, and to make the point that price doesn't necessarily determine quality' .
He authorised an advertising campaign.
There is no suggestion that the King Furniture advertisements mentioned Dare Gallery by name.
The advertising campaign authorised by Mr Sheppard respected no such limitation.
Mr Sheppard authorised advertisements in print media and on radio which made a direct comparison between specific models of modular furniture --- the Phoenix modular sofa sold by King Furniture and the Montreaux modular sofa sold by Dare Gallery.
In the radio advertisements the bowling ball theme was perpetuated with a spoken commentary being punctuated by the sound of bowling balls and falling pins.
3 There were a number of very similar versions of the print advertisements.
A typical example is reproduced as Appendix A to this judgment while a transcript of the radio advertisement is at Appendix B.
In its Statement of Claim King Furniture pleaded that the advertisements made a number of representations which were misleading or deceptive within the meaning of s 52 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) (The TP Act).
The questions which arise for consideration are:
 
1. what representations are, relevantly, made by the two types of advertisements?
2. are any or all of the representations misleading or deceptive?
3. if so, what relief, if any, should be granted to King Furniture?
4 The advertisements were published and broadcast in about mid-August 2007.
The proceedings were commenced by Application filed 29 August 2007.
They included a claim for interlocutory relief.
Upon the proceedings being commenced the advertising campaign by Dare Gallery was discontinued.
It has not been recommenced.
Pending hearing of the proceedings the matter has been accommodated by an undertaking from Dare Gallery not to resume the advertising campaign.
LEGAL PRINCIPLES 
 
5 The principles to be applied in the present case are well established and there was little dispute about them, although naturally enough, the parties differed in where they placed greatest emphasis.
A choice to advance the merits of a particular product by comparison advertising must be carefully implemented.
Care must be taken not to mislead with half-truths about a competing product or by the omission of 'an essential integer to a fair comparison'.
Some of the cases where the principles have been discussed or referred to are 
 Duracell Australia Pty Ltd v Union Carbide Australia Ltd (1988) 14 IPR 293 at 299; Collier Constructions Pty Ltd v Foskett Pty Ltd (1990) 97 ALR 460 at 477-479 (affirmed on appeal (1991) ATPR 46-071) (' Collier Constructions') ; Hoover (Australia) Pty Ltd v Email Ltd (1991) 104 ALR 369 at 375; Sterling Winthrop Pty Ltd v Boots Co (Australia) Pty Ltd (1995) 32 IPR 361 at 364-365 and Bristol-Myers Squibb Australia Pty Ltd v Astra Pharmaceuticals Pty Ltd (1999) 45 IPR 144 at 165.
6 So far as s 52 of the TP Act is concerned '(i)t is not essential for the applicant to show that the effects of the contravention of s 52 upon these persons would continue up to the point of sale to them by the respondent' ( Collier Constructions 97 ALR at 478 citing Taco Co of Australia Inc v Taco Bell Pty Ltd (1982) 42 ACR 177 at 197-199).
As a Full Court said recently in Astrazeneca Pty Ltd v GlaxoSmithKline Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCAFC 22 , (2006) ATPR 42-106 (at [33]):
 
 'For s 52 of the Act to be enlivened it is sufficient that the conduct complained of, in all the circumstances, answers the statutory description, that is to say, that it is misleading or deceptive or is likely to mislead or deceive.
It is unnecessary to go further and establish that any actual or potential consumer has taken or is likely to take any positive step in consequence of the misleading or deception.
' 
 

7 Decisions of this Court have, from time to time, emphasised that it is no answer to a claim of misleading or deceptive advertising that it was merely intended to catch the attention and that the full facts would have been disclosed before any financial commitment was made (see St Lukes Health Insurance v Medical Benefits Fund of Australia Ltd (1995) ATPR 41-428, Minister for Health and Aged Care v Harrington Associates Ltd [2000] FCA 1723 ; (2000) 107 FCR 212 at 233-4 and Medical Benefits Fund of Australia Ltd v Cassidy [2003] FCAFC 289 ; (2003) 205 ALR 402 at [43] .
8 The respondents, however, argued in the present case that the matter was to be tested by reference to what might happen at the potential point of sale, and with the benefit of further information.
They submitted:
 
 
 '35.
In the circumstances of this case, prospective customers of sofas would normally need to attend one of the Applicant's or Respondents' showrooms to discuss their specific furniture requirements; both as to configuration, fabric and final price of their chosen furniture and are likely to go to a number of different retailers before deciding to purchase.

 
 
 
 
 
 36.
The furniture would likely be a substantial purchase and would not be bought either on impulse or merely by reference to the advertisements.
' 
 
 
 

and (in the context of the relief sought):
 
 
 '119.
Any impact the alleged misrepresentations may have had upon potential consumers would have worked itself out because any consumer likely to purchase a sofa would have had an opportunity to discover the truth and reverse any misrepresentation when they attended at the parties' respective stores to investigate the purchase of such sofas.
' 
 

9 The respondents relied, in this connection, on Parkdale Custom Built Furniture Pty Ltd v Puxu Pty Ltd [1982] HCA 44 ; (1982) 149 CLR 191 ( 'Parkdale' ).
In Parkdale the causes of action focussed on the proposition that the respondent had engaged in misleading or deceptive conduct by manufacturing and offering for sale furniture that was deceptively similar to the distinctive furniture made by the applicant.
The High Court rejected allegations of breach of s 52 of the TP Act observing that purchasers of expensive furniture might be expected, if acting reasonably, to satisfy themselves of the origins and manufacture of the furniture before purchase.
It is important to note that the case was argued in the High Court on the footing that the relevant deception was 'with respect to the source of manufacture as distinct from deception as to the quality of the goods ' (per Mason J at 202 --- italics in original).
The respondent's practice, in that case, of labelling its chairs to show the name of the manufacturer was found to be a relevant, indeed critical, part of its conduct viewed as a whole.
The case did not turn on the effect of advertising, but on what might happen at the point of sale.
That was to be evaluated by reference to the entirety of the conduct of the respondent.
Such considerations do not apply in the present case.
There is no reason, therefore, to depart from the well established principles to which I earlier referred.
WHAT ARE THE REPRESENTATIONS MADE IN THE DARE GALLERY ADVERTISEMENTS?

 
10 The Statement of Claim pleads the representations in the following way:
 
 
 '10.
The following representations are contained in the published advertisements: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (a) that the Phoenix Modular Sofa is not made in Australia ( "the Not Australian Made Representation" ); 
 
 (b) that the warranty on the Dare Montreaux Sofa was twice as valuable a warranty than that available on the Phoenix Modular Sofa ( "the Dare Warranty Representation "); 
 
 (c) in the alternative to (b), that the warranty on the Dare Montreaux Sofa was significantly more valuable than the warranty available on the Phoenix Modular Sofa (" the Alternative Dare Warranty Representation "); 
 
 (d) that the warranty on foam in respect of the Phoenix Modular Sofa was for a period less than 10 years (" the Foam Warranty Representation "); 
 
 (e) that apart from the price and warranty, the Phoenix Modular Sofa and the Montreaux Modular sofa were of the same or similar quality (" the Same or Similar Quality Representation "); 
 
 (f) that the retail price of the Phoenix Modular Sofa was $7815 (" the Price Representation ").

 
 
 
 
 
 11.
The following representations are contained in the broadcast advertisement: 
 
 
 
 
 
 (a) the Not Australian Made Representation; 
 
 (b) that all of King's sofas are made outside Australia; 
 
 (c) that all of Dare's sofas are made in Australia; 
 
 (d) the Dare Warranty Representation; 
 
 (e) the Alternative Dare Warranty Representation; 
 
 (f) The Same or Similar Quality Representation; 
 
 (g) that Dare Sofas have a lifetime guarantee as to their component parts (" the Lifetime Guarantee Representation ").
' 
 
 
 

11 In its Defence Dare Gallery expressly admitted the allegations in paragraph 10(e) and 11(e), but otherwise, in one way or another, resisted the pleaded allegations.
I shall deal, therefore, with each in turn.
10(a) and 11(a) --- Not Australian Made Representation 
 
12 There is no doubt that the published advertisement alleged that the King Phoenix sofa was not made in Australia.
In my view the same representation was made in the radio advertisement.
I find the representation as pleaded established.
10(b) and 11(d) --- The Dare Warranty Representation 
 
13 The suggested representation is that the warranty on the Dare Montreaux sofa was twice as valuable a warranty as that available on the King Phoenix sofa.
Although it is true that both the published advertisement and the radio advertisement use the terms 'half the price' and 'twice the warranty' these statements lack any real specificity and in my view are too general to be regarded as intended to provide specific, rather than very approximate, comparisons.
For example, in the published advertisement it is clear that the figures shown do not satisfactorily equate with the general statement 'half the price'.
Similarly the general statement 'twice the warranty' invites further attention.
I am not satisfied that there is a sufficiently specific representation that the Dare warranty was 'twice as valuable'.
10(c) and 11(e) --- The Alternative Dare Warranty Representation 
 
14 The alternative representation pleaded is that the warranty on the Dare Montreaux sofa was significantly more valuable than the warranty available on the King Phoenix sofa.
Curiously, in its Defence Dare Gallery in substance denies the allegation in 10(c) with respect to the published advertisement but admits it with respect to the radio advertisement.
Although the pleaded alternative representation remains somewhat general I am satisfied that it captures fairly the intendment of both kinds of advertisement.
There seems no doubt that the representation that the Dare Montreaux sofa was available for (less than) half the price of the King Phoenix sofa was intended to be seen in counter position with the suggestion that, at the same time, the available warranties were significantly more valuable on the Dare Montreaux sofa than on the King Phoenix sofa.
I find this representation established.
10(d) --- The Foam Warranty Representation 
 
15 This suggested representation arises only from the published advertisement.
It arises in particular from the table in that advertisement.
It is quite clear that the intent of the comparison there offered is to suggest that the King Phoenix sofa, if it has any warranty on foam at all, has warranty arrangements for foam which are less than the 10 years available for the Dare Montreaux sofa.
I am satisfied that this representation is established.
10(e) and 11(f) --- The Same or Similar Quality Representation 
 
16 This representation is admitted with respect to the published advertisements but not with respect to the radio advertisement.
I can see no satisfactory basis for any distinction.
In my view the statements made in the radio advertisement, which are introduced with the words 'buying a quality sofa' convey the same sense as the admitted representation in the published advertisement.
Even without the admission I would be satisfied that this representation has been established.
The whole tenor of the advertisements is to suggest that, with respect to sofas of a similar quality, the Dare sofa is better priced and has a better warranty.
10(f) --- The Price Representation 
 
17 In my view this representation is clearly made in the published advertisement.
11(b) and 11(c) --- Australian made?

 
18 The suggested representation in the radio advertisement depends upon a particular and limited construction of the phrase 'Dare sofa is Australian made, Kings isn't'.
In my view it is not established that this statement refers to all Dare sofas or all King sofas.
The better view is that it refers to the sofas earlier identified in the radio advertisement --- namely Dare's Montreaux modular sofa and King's Phoenix modular sofa.
I find that these representations are not established.
11(g) --- The Lifetime Guarantee Representation 
 
19 No actionable representation is separately alleged in the Statement of Claim to emerge from the statement in the published advertisement that Dare's Montreaux sofa has a lifetime structural guarantee and King's Phoenix sofa does not.
However, the radio advertisement says 'Dare sofas are guaranteed for life.
King's aren't.
' This statement is not confined to matters of structure but applies to the sofa as a whole.
I am not satisfied that the representation can fairly be read to specifically relate to 'component parts' but I am satisfied that the radio advertisements make a representation that Dare sofas have a lifetime guarantee.
WERE THE REPRESENTATIONS MISLEADING OR DECEPTIVE?


 10(a) and 11(a) --- Not Australian Made Representation 
 
20 More expensive sofas in the Dare Gallery range are made in Australia by Oakgrove Pty Limited.
The evidence was that all Dare Montreaux modular sofas are manufactured in Australia.
King Furniture has two factories, one in Sydney and one in Shanghai, China.
King Phoenix modular sofas are made at both locations.
Ms Margaret Thompson, the office manager at King Furniture's Sydney premises, gave affidavit evidence that she had extracted, from a database maintained by King Furniture, a large number of records which she printed.
According to her searches, and the data which was printed out, in 2006 345 Phoenix sofas sold by King Furniture were manufactured in Australia and 215 in China, while in 2007, from January to June, 104 were manufactured in Australia and 72 in China.
21 Ms Thompson was not cross-examined although counsel for Dare Gallery said that he did not accept that the figures were satisfactorily established in the precise amounts given by Ms Thompson.
That was because earlier attempts by Mr King to provide hearsay evidence of similar searches carried out by another employee, which I rejected, yielded different figures.
However, there was no issue taken by Dare Gallery that a substantial number of the overall quantity of King Phoenix modular sofas made and sold by King Furniture are manufactured in Australia.
22 According to Mr Sheppard's evidence he gave instructions to Matthew Mister, Dare Gallery's Marketing Manager, to design print advertisements on 13 August 2007, to Mr Grahame Dingle, Dare Gallery's advertising and marketing consultant, to create and produce a radio advertisement 'in or around August 2007' and that he approved the content of both forms of advertisement on or about 16 August 2007.
The print advertisements were first published on 17 August 2007 and the radio advertisements were first broadcast on 16 August 2007.
23 I am satisfied that Mr Sheppard knew that King Phoenix sofas are manufactured in both Sydney and Shanghai.
He acknowledged as much in his evidence.
The explanation which he gave for this representation was that an enquiry which he made on 11 August 2007 at a King Furniture store in Richmond, Victoria about a particular King Phoenix modular sofa on the showroom floor in a particular fabric (Daintree) yielded the information that it was made in Shanghai.
According to Mr Sheppard's evidence he was first told, on 11 August 2007, that a sofa in the same fabric was available from Australia at a slightly higher price ($8,166 rather than $7,815).
Two days later when he called the store 'to confirm the information' he was told that the sofa was not available in that fabric from the Sydney factory.
24 I reject Mr Sheppard's explanation as any form of defence.
The evidence did not establish that the King Phoenix sofa in the advertisement was a photo of a sofa in the Daintree fabric.
It would be impossible, in any event, to tell from the photo in the advertisement what fabric is used.
There is no suggestion in the print advertisement that the King Phoenix sofa depicted in the photo was shown in a particular fabric or was made in China.
The radio advertisement provides no scope at all for any excuse of the kind offered.
25 I am satisfied that the representation in both the print advertisement and the radio advertisement to the effect that King Phoenix sofas are not made in Australia was misleading or deceptive within the meaning of s 52 of the TP Act.
10(c) and 11(e) --- The Alternative Dare Warranty Representation 
 
26 In the print advertisement this representation is conveyed in part by use of the words 'twice the warranty' and also by parts of the table which appeared in that advertisement.
In the radio advertisement the representation is conveyed also by the words 'twice the warranty' and also by the words 'Dare sofas are guaranteed for life.
King's aren't'.
In his affidavit evidence Mr Sheppard offered the following analysis about these matters in the form of the table set out hereunder.
