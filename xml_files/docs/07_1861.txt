2 The second applicant ('Mr McCarron') claims similar declarations and orders and additionally claims that the conduct complained of constitutes a breach of an agreement made between himself and the Commonwealth relating to his employment.
3 The claim arises from the refusal of the Commonwealth to permit Mr McCarron to take accrued flex leave to enable him to attend an event which was held on 30 November 2006 known as the National Day of Community Protest ('NDCP').
The CPSU is an affiliate of the Australia Council of Trade Unions ('the ACTU').
The NDCP was held as part of the campaign organised by the ACTU against the recent amendments to the Act: see Workplace Relations Amendment (Work Choices) Act 2005 (Cth) ('Work Choices').
FACTS 
 
4 At all material times Mr McCarron was and remains an employee of the Commonwealth Department of Employment and Workplace Relations ('the Department').
His employment is governed by an Australian Workplace Agreement ('AWA') made between himself and the Commonwealth.
Shortly after joining the Department on 1 November 2001 Mr McCarron became a member of the CPSU and has remained a member of that union.
5 The Workplace Authority, formerly known as the Office of Employment Advocate ('OEA'), an organisation within the Department, is constituted by a number of business units.
One such business unit is Agreement Services, previously known as Australian Workplace Agreements Operations.
The functions of Agreement Services include the provision of advice and assistance to employers and employees.
Agreement Services is also responsible for the management and lodgement of AWAs, project work and prior to 27 March 2006, the review of AWAs under the Act.
6 Mr McCarron is engaged in such business unit and as an Agreements Specialist dealing with AWAs he is required to coach and mentor staff.
Approximately 82 employees are engaged in that section, 50 of whom work in the Sydney office.
Ten employees are engaged in a similar role to that of Mr McCarron.
Application for leave 
 
7 On 16 March 2005 the Executive of the ACTU passed a resolution to oppose the changes in the industrial relations system and organise the campaign known as 'Your Rights at Work'.
As part of such campaign it arranged the NDCP.
The ACTU considered that maximising attendance at the NDCP was essential to the success of the campaign which included a day of protest in November 2005 ('the 2005 NDCP') and a week of protest from 25 June --- 1 July 2006 ('the June protest').
In October 2006 the CPSU distributed a bulletin to all its members encouraging attendance at the NDCP and commenced to register details of its members who would be attending.
A further bulletin was published on 1 November 2006 the relevant portions of which provided as follows:
 
 Make a difference on November 30 
 01 November 2006 
 Australia's largest-ever national rally for decent workplace rights is approaching fast.
Now is the time to book your leave for Thursday morning November 30... and get organised.
Why you need to attend: The Government's harsh new industrial laws are being been [sic] used to slash pay and conditions, and sack people unfairly.
November 30 is a historic opportunity for workers, unions, families and communities to campaign together for a fairer system.
With a federal election looming, the time is right to send a strong message to all politicians about respecting our rights at work.
What are we rallying for?
