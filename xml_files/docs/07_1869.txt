The design is in respect of a particular style of mattress.
Registration was effected on 2 September 1996 with a priority date of 26 July 1996.
Chiropedic sues the respondent, Radburg Pty Ltd, for infringement of its design.
Radburg denies infringement and also cross-claims for the cancellation of the registration.
One of the grounds upon which it relies to support its cross-claim is that the design was not novel.
With the consent of the parties this issue is to be determined before the trial on infringement.
2 It is common ground that between 20 and 23 July 1996 (that is, before the priority date) Chiropedic exhibited a mattress to which the design was applied at the National New Products Parade Fair that was held at the Melbourne Exhibition Centre.
The fair had been organised by the Furnishing Industry Association of Australia (Vic/Tas) (FIAA).
The publication at the fair will invalidate the registration for want of novelty unless s 47 of the Designs Act is attracted.
Although this section does not appear in the current legislation, the validity of the design in suit is to be determined under the provisions of the superseded statute: Designs Act 2003 (Cth), s 151(3).
3 As a general rule, any prior disclosure of a design destroys its novelty.
There are a limited number of exceptions to this rule.
Under the 1906 Act one of the exceptions was found in s 47.
The section, along with the heading below which the section appeared, provided:
 
 "Exhibiting of designs at official or international exhibitions
 
 
 
 47(1) The fact that a design, or any article to which a design has been applied, has been exhibited at an official or officially recognized international exhibition, or that a description of a design has been published during the holding of such an exhibition, shall not prejudice or prevent the registration of the design or invalidate the monopoly therein, if the application for the registration of the design is made within six months after the opening of the exhibition.

 
 
 
 
 
 (2) A certificate by the Minister that an exhibition is an official exhibition, or an officially recognized international exhibition, shall, for the purposes of this section, be conclusive evidence that the exhibition is an official exhibition, or an officially recognized international exhibition, as the case requires.
" 
 
 
 

4 Essentially, the section gave a six month grace period in the case of disclosure at an exhibition that is an "official or officially recognized international exhibition".
Just what that means, though, is not clear.
First of all, it is not clear whether the exhibitions at which a non-prejudicial disclosure could be made were: (1) an official international exhibition and (2) an officially recognized international exhibition; or (1) an official exhibition (whether international or not) and (2) an officially recognized international exhibition.
Secondly, each of the words or expressions "official", "officially recognized" and "international" have more than one meaning.
5 Despite the vigorous protests by Mr McGowan SC, the starting point for the resolution of these problems of construction is the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property which was opened for signature on 20 March 1883.
The Minister who introduced the Bill for the Designs Act 1906 said that cl 47 had been taken from the Patents, Designs and Trade Marks Act 1883 (UK).
He was incorrect.
Perhaps he had been misled by the marginal note to cl 47, which referred to s 58 of the UK Act.
In fact, the corresponding section in England was s 57, but its wording was quite different from that of s 47.
Section 57 permitted prior publication at an industrial or international exhibition provided it had been certified by the Board of Trade.
6 However that may be, it is clear s 47 was based on Art 11(1) of the Paris Convention.
Article 11(1) provides: 
 
 "The country of the Union shall, in conformity with their domestic legislation, grant temporary protection to patentable inventions, utility models, industrial designs and trade marks, in respect of goods exhibited at official or officially recognized international exhibitions held in the territory of any of them.
"
 

 I acknowledge that Australia did not become a party to the Paris Convention until 1925.
Nonetheless, the conclusion that the operative language in s 47 is copied from Art 11(1) is inescapable.
The alternative, that the similarity in language is mere coincidence, is one I simply cannot accept.
7 It is necessary to go back to Art 11 because of the rule that when a statute incorporates a treaty as part of domestic law, it is presumed that Parliament intended to import into domestic law a provision that has the same effect as the provision in the treaty: Koowarta v Bjelke-Petersen [1982] HCA 27 ; (1982) 153 CLR 168, 265; Applicant A v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs [1997] HCA 4 ; (1997) 190 CLR 225, 231, 240, 251-252, 272-273, 292.
8 For the purposes of interpreting the expression "official or officially recognized international exhibitions" in Art 11(1) it is permissible to have regard to preparatory work.
While this kind of material can be used only to a limited extent to construe a domestic statute ( Acts Interpretation Act 1906 (Cth), s 15AB), in the international field "the practice of resorting to preparatory work is widespread": McNair, Law of Treaties (1938) at 412.
For treaties which enter into force after 27 January 1980 see the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties , Arts 31 and 32.
9 The idea of a convention to deal with industrial property was first raised at the Universal Exhibition held in Vienna in 1873.
The Vienna Exhibition had been planned for 1859, but the war in France and the Austrian struggle for power with Prussia intervened.
Then the Lower Austrian Trade Association proposed an international exhibition and it was approved by the Emperor, Franz Joseph.
The Vienna Exhibition had over 1700 exhibitors from more than 30 countries: J Findling (ed), Historical Dictionary of World's Fairs and Exhibitions, 1851-1988 (1990); J Allwood, The Great Exhibitions (1977).
10 Five years later, at the Paris Exhibition (another major international exhibition this time organised by the French Government), it was agreed that a permanent commission would be established to draft the Paris Convention.
The main object of the Paris Convention was to secure to foreigners the same protection for industrial property (patents, designs and trademarks) as was enjoyed by foreigners in their country of nationality.
This was the so-called principle of equal protection.
11 Of concern to a number of delegates was the risk of piracy of works on display at international exhibitions.
Some States had passed laws to prevent this kind of piracy.
For example, the purpose of s 3 of the Designs Act 1850 (UK) (13  14 Vict, 104) was to provide protection against piracy for foreign exhibitors at the Great Exhibition of 1851, sometimes called the Crystal Palace Exhibition.
It gave them the opportunity of finding "either manufacturers or capitalists" to take up their invention or design before going to the trouble and expense of obtaining registration: Minutes of Evidence of Select Committee of House of Lords to Consider the Bill for the Designs Act 1850, 12 March 1851, at 9.
