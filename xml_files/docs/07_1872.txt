1 At the commencement of the hearing, I made interlocutory orders under s 50 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) restricting the publication of certain evidence in the proceedings.
Application has been made for the orders to be revoked or vacated.
2 The evidence which is the subject of the orders consists of extracts of certain meetings of the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General dealing with the subject of censorship and copies of papers that were before that Committee at those meetings.
The orders extend to a number of paragraphs of Adultshop's written submissions that refer to those meetings and to the relevant papers.
3 The Orders were made on the application of the Commonwealth Attorney-General who is the second respondent in the proceedings.
The application was supported by an affidavit the gravamen of which was that the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General (SCAG) is responsible for administering the cooperative legislative scheme for censorship in Australia and that there are arrangements in place between the SCAG Ministers to ensure the confidentiality of deliberations at their meetings.
4 Opinions are expressed in the affidavit that the confidentiality arrangements are necessary to ensure that the relevant Ministers and public officials are free to engage in full, frank and robust discussions at those meetings.
