 
 BUCHANAN J: 
 
1 Ms Demetrius McDonald was employed by the first respondent ('Parnell Laboratories') with effect from 6 February 2006.
She was employed in the role of Quality Manager, a senior position.
She reported directly to the second respondent, Mr Bell, who was the Managing Director of Parnell Laboratories.
2 She remained in employment for a little under five months.
On 30 June 2006 she was summarily dismissed by Mr Bell, having first agreed to proffer her resignation and then withdrawing it.
Both Ms McDonald and Mr Bell agree that the reason given for termination of employment was dishonesty in a response Ms McDonald gave to Mr Bell in answer to an instruction to state her times of attendance over the previous three weeks.
In a letter dated the same day Ms McDonald was advised that her employment was terminated, effective immediately, on the grounds of wilful and serious misconduct.
The Nature of the Case 
 
3 Prior to her employment Ms McDonald was made a formal offer of engagement which she accepted in writing.
It provided for eight weeks notice in writing of termination of employment 'except in the case of serious, wilful or persistent misconduct'.
It referred to the fact that ' the Company's Staff Guidelines ' which would be provided to her when she commenced employment contained 'many of the personnel policies and procedures that govern your employment and that of all Staff Members' .
Those guidelines contained, amongst many other things, a set of procedures for performance counselling directed to establishing 'the process for addressing and documenting instances of unsatisfactory performance or conduct with a view to improving performance or eliminating inappropriate conduct' .
Ms McDonald argued that these procedures were incorporated into her contract of employment.
She said her contract had been breached both by her summary dismissal and by Parnell Laboratories' failure to follow the performance counselling guidelines.
4 Ms McDonald's denial of the premise leading to the termination of her employment (that she had conducted herself dishonestly) also provided the foundation for an argument that the circumstances of the termination of her employment represented a breach of a term of mutual trust and confidence which should be implied into the contract of employment between her and Parnell Laboratories.
5 It was a substantial part of Ms McDonald's case that the circumstances which led to the confrontation on 30 June 2006 had their origins in her inability, due to her family responsibilities, to attend for work earlier than about 9am on most days.
She suggested that various requirements upon her to come to work earlier represented discrimination against her by reason of her family responsibilities.
She relied upon the fact that she had two young sons whose care and transportation to school were a shared responsibility between her and her husband.
She contended that Parnell Laboratories knew but disregarded the difficulties this created for her.
6 Finally, she alleged that shortly after the termination of her employment on 30 June 2006 she was assaulted and battered by Mr Bell when he grabbed her by the sleeve and pulled her away from a conversation with another senior manager and she was escorted to her office and from the premises.
7 From these various facts, circumstances and contentions Ms McDonald assembled the following causes of action:
 
1. breach of contract by reason of summary dismissal i.e.
failure to give eight weeks notice in writing (or make a payment in lieu);
 
2. breach of contract by reason of a failure to follow the performance counselling guidelines;
 
3. breach of contract by failing to observe an implied term of mutual trust and confidence;
 
4. discrimination on the ground of family responsibilities contrary to s 14(3A) of the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 (Cth);
 
5. assault and battery.
8 Ms McDonald sought damages (which for present purposes I will quantify only approximately) of --- (a) about $20,000 for summary termination and failing to provide eight weeks salary in lieu of notice; (b) about $20,000 for failing to follow a performance counselling process over about an eight week period; (c) in addition, damages calculated by reference to the proposition that Ms McDonald 'was well placed to continue in her employment for the following twelve months' and that 'she lost a 70 --- 80% chance to remain in that employment for that period'.
This appears to involve a claim of about $84,000 - $96,000; (d) general damages, for breach of a term of mutual trust and confidence, for assault and battery and for discrimination, of $15,000 - $20,000.
9 The questions which arise potentially for decision are as follows:
 
1. what was the reason for the termination of Ms McDonald's employment --- had she committed serious, wilful or persistent misconduct?
2. were the performance counselling provisions (at least) of the Staff Guidelines incorporated in Ms McDonald's contract of employment?
3. are damages available for loss of a chance to remain in employment?
4. should a term of mutual trust and confidence be implied into Ms McDonald's contract of employment?
5. was the dismissal of Ms McDonald from her employment unlawful discrimination on the ground of her family responsibilities;
 
6. did Mr Bell assault and/or batter Ms McDonald on 30 June 2006?
10 Before these questions are examined directly it is necessary to look more closely at some, but certainly not all, of the circumstances of Ms McDonald's short period of employment with Parnell Laboratories.
Ms McDonald's engagement and subsequent employment 
 
11 Parnell Laboratories develops, manufactures and sells veterinary products both in Australia and overseas.
Sale of the products is subject to strict compliance standards.
Prior to 2005, Parnell Laboratories' licence by the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority allowed it to sell its injectable products in Australia and overseas but not in the United States of America and the European Union.
According to evidence from Mr Bell, in about 2005 Parnell Laboratories decided to sell into the American and European Union markets.
To do so it needed to comply with additional specific regulatory codes which included stipulations as to quality.
12 At about the same time, the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority also foreshadowed the introduction of a new regulatory code.
Mr Bell decided to employ someone with experience in the compliance requirements under the American and European Union regulatory codes.
Ms McDonald, who trained and worked in the field of quality assurance in the United States of America, met the requirements.
She was first identified by a recruitment agency Mr Bell had engaged for that purpose.
She was subsequently interviewed, in December 2005, by Mr Bell and then offered employment.
One of the advertisements published by the recruiting agency described the character and general responsibilities of the position as follows:
 
 'As a direct result of exceptional, sustainable growth combined with plans for extensive expansion in the immediate future, our client is looking to appoint an experienced Quality Assurance manager to their executive team.
Pivotal within the strategic senior management team, this role offers an energetic and ambitious individual the opportunity to create their own goals, to engage across the entire organizational matrix, and by the proactive implementation of quality systems, to make a significant contribution to the ongoing success of this high achieving, high growth, active organisation.

 
 With a tertiary qualification in Microbiology or Life Sciences and 5 years plus experience in Pharmaceutical QA and QC roles, the successful applicant will report directly to the Managing Director 
 
 As a QA professional currently working within pharmaceuticals, preferably parenterals, you will hold sufficient breadth and depth of experience to lead the management of all quality systems across the existing and planned parenteral facilities, to implement new systems, and to guide and lead the organisation through US FDA and TGA audits.

 
 You will also be decisive leader with strong influencing and relationship building skills, an effective people manager and trainer, and will be able to demonstrate a high level of self motivation combined with a passion for achieving results.
' 
 

13 Making due allowance for the 'upbeat' nature of such advertisements it is clear that the position was to be a responsible one involving a high level of personal commitment and responsibility.
The letter of offer to Ms McDonald dated 21 December 2005 attached a position description for the position of Quality Manager.
It is too lengthy to set out here.
It drew attention to the need for a high level of achievement, including with respect to matters concerning attention to detail and those involving quality and accuracy.
14 The letter of offer dated 21 December 2005, which Ms McDonald signed by way of acceptance on 18 January 2006, contained the following matters which are relevant to issues to be later discussed:

 ...' 
 (emphasis in original)
 

15 Ms McDonald was initially engaged for a probationary period of three months but that period appears to have passed without any particular formality and without a formal performance review.
16 It will be noted that the letter of offer referred in two places, in slightly differing terms, to arrangements concerning hours of work.
It is clear that the 'normal working week' and 'normal working hours' involved a traditional 9am to 5pm, 5 day week common for office workers.
It is equally clear that the nature of the position, the responsibilities entailed and the salary provided contemplated some requirement to work in addition to those hours and outside their limits.
17 Shortly after Ms McDonald commenced her employment, she attended the first meeting of a new project called 'El Dorado'.
It was a project which involved review of business processes.
The first meeting took place at 4pm on 17 February 2006.
Ms McDonald's evidence was that on about 27 March 2006 the El Dorado project meetings were scheduled on a weekly basis on Monday and Thursday mornings at 8.30am.
18 Each month she was invited to 'MD drinks' which she described as 'a monthly scheduled meeting for Department Managers' commencing at 4.30pm.
Other evidence suggests that the monthly Managing Director's drinks were less formal, non-obligatory and open to many more staff than department managers.
This occasion however was not completely informal or social.
It provided an opportunity to emphasise achievements in particular departments and frequently involved a short presentation by a departmental nominee.
19 About 10 April 2006 a new project commenced which was called 'Project Eclipse'.
Meetings for this project were to take place on Wednesday mornings commencing about 8.30am.
20 Ms McDonald gave evidence that '[o]n a number of occasions I arrived at the El Dorado and Project Eclipse meetings late '.
The question of Ms McDonald's ability to attend meetings at 8.30 in the mornings was an important part of her case alleging that she was discriminated against because of her family responsibilities.
She attributed her inability to arrive before the commencement of the meetings to the need to take one of her sons to a child care facility.
On her evidence the earliest he could be left was 7.30am when the facility opened.
Ms McDonald sought to rely upon a general inference that her family responsibilities prevented her from arriving at work at 8.30am.
The evidence does not support such a proposition.
Ms McDonald gave no evidence, even when she was called in reply and in circumstances where the absence of such evidence had been mentioned, that she in fact regularly dropped her son at the facility at 7.30am.
The evidence certainly discloses that she regularly arrived at work later than 8.30am and, as will in due course be further explored, often after 9am but it did not establish the basic factual premise upon which her case depended (that she was unable to arrive at work before 8.30am) much less that she was dismissed for that reason.
21 On Ms McDonald's evidence there was, at one time, a suggestion by another staff member that the meetings be moved to 9am to accommodate Ms McDonald's difficulties but the proposal was resisted by other attendees and not implemented.
Ms McDonald's recollection is supported by evidence given by other persons who attended the meetings although it is clear from their evidence that the meetings remained at 8.30am because they were generally suitable to those attending in the light of their own responsibilities and not for reasons which had any particular connection with Ms McDonald.
One of the attendees, Mr Kenrick, who was at the time the Procurement Manager for Parnell Laboratories, gave evidence, which I accept, that at one meeting at which Ms McDonald was present his suggestion that the meeting time might be moved to accommodate the fact that she regularly arrived late, to his surprise, was firmly resisted by her and the matter was not raised again.
22 Ms McDonald's frequent failure to arrive on time for 8.30am meetings does not appear, on the evidence, to have had any adverse consequence for her or played any part in the termination of her employment.
There were, however, concerns about her general pattern of attendance which were linked with a perception by some other members of the management staff that her lack of regular and sufficient attendance caused delays in the discharge of some of her responsibilities which affected their own work.
Some of this evidence was general and some of it was quite particular.
Mr Kenrick, for example, gave the following evidence:
 
 
 '21.
During the time that the Applicant worked with the First Respondent my office was located two offices down the hallway.
Due to my close proximity to the Applicant it was my observation that the Applicant was regularly absent during the middle of the day.
In particular this came to my attention during the months of May 2006 and June 2006.

 
 
 
 
 
 22.
I observed that in the middle of the day, between two or four times a week, the Applicant was absent from her office for over an hour and that upon her return she thereafter ate her lunch at her desk.
One of the reasons it was apparent to me that the Applicant was absent is because on average, on several times a day, I needed to liaise with the Applicant about my work or to obtain her sign off on work ...
When I specifically went to find her to do this she was often absent.

 
 23.
I also observed other employees, including senior executive management, attempting to find her to have work authorised when the Applicant was absent.

 
 ... 
 
 25.
I also observed that the Applicant regularly arrived late, often arriving between 9-10am (sometimes later).
The Applicant also sometimes left work between 4 and 5pm.
To the best of my knowledge, the Applicant did not make up these hours on other occasions.

 
 26.
I do not recall the Applicant ever communicating in advance with me or other management that she was likely to be absent from the office on these occasions, or the reasons for her absence.
In my experience it is both necessary and common courtesy in a manufacturing environment, and in accordance with the First Respondent's policies, that absences and whereabouts be communicated to other senior staff and specifically the direct line Manager.

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 27.
On one occasion (I do not recall when) when the Applicant had arrived at work at 10.00am, left between 4.00 and 5.00pm and had more than a one hour lunch break, I recall Ms Bateup and I had a conversation to the following effect: 
 
 
 
 LB: "I have serious concerns about Deme.
I'm going to start recording her hours.
" 
 
 
 
 
 
 Me: "This is an appropriate action to take to protect the interests of the company and its staff.
It is an unusual and a difficult situation.
"
 
 
 
 28.
Although I do not remember when, I recall attending a meeting about "future business planning" with James Wynn, Chief Financial Officer, and Dr Alan Bell, the Second Respondent in these proceedings.
During this meeting I said words to the following effect; 
 
 
 
 Me: "I have concerns about the quality department and that it is going backwards and that Deme McDonald is having difficulty coping.
There's something not quite right there.
Compared to Clare (the Applicant's predecessor), she is not even in the ball park".

 
 
 29.
I raised these concerns because ... the Applicant's absences and delays were impacting on my own work as Procurement Manager.
' 
 
 
 

23 Mr Kenrick was cross-examined extensively about this evidence but adhered to his recollection and did not relevantly qualify his affidavit evidence.
24 Ms Lisa Bateup, to whom Mr Kenrick referred in his affidavit evidence, was no longer employed by Parnell Laboratories at the time of the proceedings.
She was subpoenaed to give evidence and gave her evidence orally.
She had been, during the period of Ms McDonald's employment, the Production Manager.
She occupied an office next door to Ms McDonald.
The petitioning between the offices contained large areas of glass and she was able, without difficulty, to see Ms McDonald come and go from her office.
From about the beginning of June 2006 she began to pay particular attention to Ms McDonald's movements.
When asked why she had done so she replied:
 
 'There were --- there were aspects of the production chain that relied on quality sign-offs as well, for the product to get released to customers.
And I had performance management things that I had to meet that related to product getting to the customer within a certain timeframe that quality also impacted on.
' 
 

25 Ms Bateup became concerned that delays in Ms McDonald attending to her responsibilities were holding up necessary documentation for a week or more rather than a day or so.
The following evidence was given:
 
 'HIS HONOUR: What sort of delay are we talking about?---there was time required to do sterility testing, and so on, on batches, and that took up to a couple of weeks, and so, when that information got back, the expectation would be that the documentation was looked at fairly quickly and released, and so sometimes, even after the documentation --- the sterility tests were returned, the products sat in quarantine for a week or more.

 
 MS THEW: So, Ms Bateup, just going back one step, what time --- what kind of time would you expect Ms McDonald to have signed the batches off within?---Within, you know, a day or two of receiving all the necessary information back from test results.

 
 ... 
 
 So you're saying that the batches should have been signed off within a day or two, but sometimes it was taking up to one or two weeks?---Correct, a week or more.

 
 Is that why you had concerns --- the concerns that you spoke about?---Yes.
' 
 

26 These concerns led Ms Bateup to do two things.
She commenced to make notes in her diary of Ms McDonald's arrival and departure times, and sometimes her absences at lunchtime, and she spoke to Mr Bell about her concerns.
Her evidence was that her concerns developed in the period from April to June 2006 and she commenced to make a record in her diary from the beginning of June.
The first record is on Thursday, 1 June and shows Ms McDonald arriving at 9.45am.
The following day she arrived at 9.37am.
There is no reason to doubt the general reliability of Ms Bateup's observations.
They disclose a general pattern, over the period in which she kept a record, that Ms McDonald arrived more often than not substantially later than 9am, on four occasions at about 9am or shortly thereafter, on no occasion before 9am and that she left, generally speaking not long after 5pm.
Occasionally, according to Ms Bateup's observations, she was absent for quite lengthy periods at lunchtime.
The four longest periods were one hour 7 minutes, one hour 20 minutes, one hour 37 minutes and two hours 12 minutes.
27 There was some other material from both Parnell Laboratories and Ms McDonald which was advanced by each of them as a foundation to draw inferences about Ms McDonald's attendance.
In the case of Parnell Laboratories the material concerned an analysis of records generated by the use of a swipe key issued to Ms McDonald.
The first and last use of the key on any particular day was extracted.
These entries do not give any reliable picture of departure from the premises because use of the swipe key was not required to exit.
So far as arrival times are concerned they confirm an initial pattern of arrival during February 2006 generally between 8.30 and 9am (although sometimes earlier and on one occasion at 10.16am), a mixed position through March 2006 with arrivals in the week commencing 6 March 2006 between 8.31am and 9.29am, in the following week between 7.56am and 9.52am (three occasions substantially after 9am), in the week of 20 March 2006 between 8.24am and 9.28am, in the week of 27 March between 7.05am and 8.33am and thereafter a general pattern through April of attendance between roughly 8.30am and 9.30am and a pattern of arrival in May 2006 generally between 8.30am and 9.00am (on one occasion 10.28am) until the records which were in evidence cease at 19 May 2006.
28 Ms McDonald produced records relating to the roam tag in the motor vehicle she used to travel to work.
On her evidence it took about 20 to 30 minutes after passing through the toll collection point for her to arrive at work.
For the period 1 May to 19 May it generally confirmed the swipe card records.
Thereafter for the balance of May it suggests that Ms McDonald arrived at work generally between 8.30 and 9.00am although there are some earlier exceptions.
In the period during which Ms Bateup kept her diary the roam tag records seem to confirm the general accuracy of Ms Bateup's observations during the first week in June.
Thereafter the roam tag records for arrivals were not made available.
29 Although Mr Kenrick and Ms Bateup were concerned about Ms McDonald's pattern of attendance the significance of the records to which I have referred for the present case is not, in the first instance, that they showed dilatory performance on the part of Ms McDonald.
Some of these records were not available at all to Mr Bell when he terminated Ms McDonald's employment.
He certainly did not have the swipe key records nor Ms McDonald's roam tag records.
His evidence was that he had received oral reports from Ms Bateup about the matters which she had recorded in her diary but did not have the diary record itself.
The material to which I have referred does however confirm an objective foundation for subsequent events.
30 As earlier observed no formal performance review was carried out at the expiration of Ms McDonald's probationary period.
According to Mr Bell's evidence the usual general performance review for all staff members was due to commence some time in May and would conclude with a review of remuneration at the end of June.
His evidence was that he sent Ms McDonald a self-appraisal form for the purpose of the general review towards the end of May.
On 9 June he sent a general reminder by email to all his reportees indicating that he wished to complete their performance review by 19 June.
On 26 June he sent an email to Ms McDonald asking 'when can I expect your PR DP' (performance review development plan).
Ms McDonald replied that afternoon that she would complete the PR/PD (sic) after completing some other tasks on 27 June.
The following morning (27 June) Mr Bell sent Ms McDonald a further email.
It is possible to infer from its tone and contents that there were a number of matters of concern to him and that he wished to emphasise the necessity for Ms McDonald to comply with his requests.
The email read:
 
 'Deme, 
 
 1.
By COB today, please provide me : 
 
 
 1.
Record of your daily attendance at Parnell premises over the last 3 weeks.
Note the time of arrival, lunch break duration and time of departure .

 
 
 
 2.
Status Report of your priority responsibilities on which we have been meeting regularly --- see my unanswered email request of yesterday.
